Si ambo verbum praedicant, hic quidem scripto, ille voce, quomodo non sunt

Praedicandi quidem scientia est quodammodo Angelica, vtrouis modo iuuans, seu

(...). id est.

Neque honestus est ille cibi apparatus qui plura habet condimenta quam ea quae
nutriunt, nec est bellus vrbanusue orationis vsus, qui auditores magis potest
delectare quam iuuare.

Clemens Alexandrinus in his first book, Strom. Page 116.
If both preach the word, this man by writing, and that man by speaking, why
are not both to be approved, which have caused faith to work by love? etc.

The knowledge of preaching is in a manner Angelical, whether it works by
handwriting, or by tonguespeaking; because he which sows in the spirit,
shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.

Erasmus in his Preface upon Augustine.
Because he perceived the use of books to extend farther then the use of
speech, he did withdraw what time he could to this employment.

Clemens Alexandrinus in his first book Strom. Page 127.
Neither is that provision of meat allowable which is set forth with more
sauces, then which nourish: neither is that use of speech convenient or
seemly, which may more delight, then profit the hearers.

and those that show mercy unto them, as Rahab, the Midwiues, and others. The
former may teach the wicked to beware, because God certainly pays home at
the last. The latter may confirm all true believers in Gods promises, which
ever were and shall be performed in their time. Also, make us patient to endure
the Lords good pleasure ever, seeing he both so graciously regards, and so
mercifully moderateth the afflictions of his children. Both the points together
may teach us that kingdoms and governments are disposed by God, even as shall
please his holy will. For he sets up, and he takes down, he establishes
and changes, according as he is served and obeyed by Princes and people,

birth, as it were, and the beginning of the Church, in the first fifteen
Chapters. Then, the education and bringing up of the same, in the rest of the
book.

CHAP. 1.
This first Chapter has these chief heads in it. The multiplication of the
Israelites. The cruelty of the Egyptians. The virtue of the Midwiues.


COncerning ye first point, you see in the fifth verse, that all the souls
which came out of the loins of Jacob into Egypt with him, were but seventy
souls: of which little flock God made such an increase, as the Egyptians grew
afraid of it. For they brought-forth fruit and increased in abundance, says
the seventh verse, and were multiplied, and were exceeding mighty, so that the
land was full of them. Some make the Hebrew word to signify an increase like
corn, where one grain brings forth thirty, sixty, or a 100. Some, as
fishes, which multiply in greater number than any creature. R. Salamoh says,
the women had often four and fix at a burden, God so providing to fulfill his
promise touching their increase, Genesis 22. 17. In the book of Numbers, you
may more particularly see what came of every one. For Reuben, the eldest son
of Jacob, so increased, that his branches there are said to be six and forty
thousand and five hundred. Simeon, his second son, increased to nine and
fifty thousand, three hundred and fifty; Gad, his third son, to five and
forty thousand, six hundred and fifty, and so for the rest, read their increase
in that place. Whereof to make some good use to our selves, we may note and
mark first, the truth of Gods propromise made to Abraham in the 15. of Genesis
when he bad him look up to the stars of heaven, and number them, if he could,
assuring him then, that even so would he make his posterity and offspring a
mighty people, and a great kindred, which we all see here was fulfilled. So
assuredly true are all other of Gods promises, and therefore think of what
you will, your faith and comfort shall not fail you. That sweet promise, that,
at what time soever a sinner repents truly of his sins, God in mercy will
forgive him, it shall never fail. He may as soon cease to be God, as cease
to be true in any thing which he has spoken. And for this particular he has
not only spoken it, but sworn it, that, as he lives he will not the death of
any true pe^itent and sorrowful sinner. We may not therefore do him wrong,
and doubt of it. It is no pride to take fast Non est ^aec superbia elati, s^d
confessio non ingrati. Aug.
hold of this word, but it is duty due from us to confess his truth, and to be
thankful. An other promise he has made to us, that, if we seek the kingdom
and the righteousness thereof, these worldly wants of ours shall ever be
supplied, as shall be fit and good for us. This also will he as assuredly
keep, as he is God, to the great quietness of our hearts, if we will believe
him. In a word, that promise of all promises, that, if we believe in his Son,
we shall never perish, but have eternal life, he will perform. So, both for
this life, and that to come, we have his word: and, no more than he failed
Abraham in multiplying his seed, will he fail us in any promise. Only his
time we must tarry, and hasty minds learn humble patience. He knows when
is best both for him, and us. Tarry he may, but come he will. Never untruth
passed from him, never any that believed in him was disappointed of his hope.
Secondly, we may observe here the rising of houses and families, The 2. use.
whence it is, even from the Lord, who blesses where he pleases with increase
of children, and makes a name spread, as likewise dries up and cutteth off,
as he pleases, others. It must make us cease from envy, where we see
increase, and stay rash judgment, where we see decrease. For it is the Lords
work: in whose matters we must well beware how we meddle. A third use
arises from the time of this increase, which The 3. use.
was chiefelie and especially after Joseph's death, whereupon S. Austin gives
this observation. Joseph is dead and the children of Israel increase, what is
this, my brethren? As long as Joseph lived they are not said to increase, but
after his death. Surely, brethren, these things figured in that Joseph, were
fulfilled in in our Joseph. For before our Joseph died, few believed in him,
but after his death and resurrection, throughout all the world the Israelites
increased and multiplied, that is, the Christians. So said the Lord himself
in the Gospel, except the corn die, that falls into the gronnd, it
remains but it self alone, but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.
Now, not in Iudaea only is Christ known, but from the rising of the sun, to
the going down of the same, etc. Thus may we profit by their multiplication.

2. The second head in this chapter is the cruelty of the Egyptians: by means
whereof a very bitter and heavy affliction The affliction of the Israelites.
followed this great and glorious multiplication. The use to our selves may be
this, that even so does adversity follow prosperity, and therefore prosperity
should ever prepare for adversity. A wise man in his good day thinks of his
evil, and daily beholding the sun over shadowed at times with a dark cloud
makes use of it to his good. Sorrow and joy will not dwell together, but by
composition they were thus agreed, as the Poets feign, that as soon as the
one has had a time, the other shall enter and have his time also, the former
passing away and giving place. Let no wiseman therefore say as David said,
tush, tush, this estate shall never decay, for the Lord turned his face, and
David was soon troubled. Job on a day could not think on such a change as
after happened to him, and yet all to the glory of God, and his good. No
earthly father loving his child does forbear to chastise him: much less
does the father of Spirits leave his children without fit corvection, since
both he loves more, and knows how better to correct for their good. The
path to heaven is beaten out through many tribulations: and up must every man
and woman take their cross that will be his in eternal comfort.

Let us note again in this place, the causes of this their affliction and
oppression, as the Spirit of wisdom, for our good, has here laid them
down. The first is, their very increasing, and multiplying. For the king
said, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are greater and mightier
than we: come, let us work wisely with them, lest they multiply. Where we
see, that Gods favor bestowed in mercy, where he likes, is still an eyesore
to evil men, matter enough for them to grind and grate their teeth at, and to
cause them to enter into plots and conspiracies against them. The eye of envy
looks ever upward: who is above, who rises, who prospers, who is well
spoken of, well thought of, or any way favored by the Lord? and as much
grieved is a spiteful spirit at the good of an other, as at the harm of
himself. Which Diogenes noted, when he saw a known envious man look sad.
No man, says he, can now tell, whether harm has happened to this fellow, or
good to his neighbor, for both alike vex him. It was the blot of Athens, that
renowned City, to have few of any excellent virtue escape the rage of envy in
it, but that either they were disgraced, or banished, or put to death in the
end. Those whom no sword of hating foe could daunt in the field, envy
vanquished at home in the City, deprauing their services, blotting their
names, and breaking at last their guiltless hearts. Which made the Philosopher
prescribe this remedy against envy, when one asked him how he might avoid
it: Even, neither to do, nor say any good thing. Thus did envy rage against
their multiplying here. And, if Gods actions escape not man's malice, shall
yours? shall mine? shall any man's? no, no: praemoniti praemuniti, forewarned
forearmed, the stream ran ever so, and God make us ever patient and strong to
go on in our duties.

A second cause of this affliction is, a suspicious fear which Causeless

vain fears, and all unjust opinions. Why? surely because it is the course
that God has in his word threatened to wicked persons, which fear not him as
they ought to do. Astonishment Deu. 28. ve. 28. ver 65. 66. Psa. 14. ver. 5.
of heart, a trembling heart, fear both night and day, etc. read the
scriptures, and you shall find much proof of what I say. Suspect bewrayes our
thoughts, betrays our words, suspicious eyes are messengers of woe. Well fares
that man, howsoever his meat does taste, that tables not with foul suspicion.
Better to die then to be suspicious. Trust not too soon, nor yet too soon
mistrust, for mistrust will treason in the trustiest raise. The heart being
once infect with jealousy, the night is grief, the day is misery. Jealousy
is the torment of the mind, for which no wit or counsel help can find.
Suspicion wounds, and jealousy strikes dead. Causeless and undeserved
suspicion sends many an one too swiftly to their end. These sayings of wise
and true experience should much move every wise person. We see what we nurse,
when we nourish this vice. And if all this should not move us, yet let our
own credit move us, which by this means is shrewdly drawn in question, the
known verses saying thus:

Too much suspicion of another is
A flat condemning of thine own amiss.
A third cause of their affliction was a new King she former being dead, under
whom they felt no such misery. Which may Change of Prince.
justly occasion us to note carefully what danger often is in change of
Governors, if the Lord be not merciful. Solomon may have his wants, but when
his son comes in his place he thundreth, and tells the people that his
little finger shall be heavier upon them, than all his fathers hand. This might
we as deeply have tasted of, as ever did these Israelites, if God almighty
had not thought upon mercy in stead of judgment. The great neglect of those
gracious days, which under the blessed government of Queen Elizabeth, our
late renowned sovereign we comfortablie enjoyed, deserved punishment in a
high degree, we must needs confess, if we will say truth: yet in stead
thereof, our most sweet God, whose goodness knows neither bottom nor
measure, has raised up over us such a King again, as both so firmly is
fastened to the love of the Gospel, and so enriched with all other princely
virtues either of nature or grace, as not only we with bowed knees may ever
praise the name of God, but all foreign Nations speak and write of so
admirable mercy vouchsafed unto us; God for his Christ's sake make us
thankful. That the King knew not Joseph, Divines say, it was either for want
of reading the Histories, or because unthankfully he contemned the good that
was done in other times, and to other men. S. Augustine here gives a note,
how men may know what King rules within Aug. Sermon. 34. de tempore.
them, to whose words I refer the reader.

And let this forgetting of Joseph, that is, of the service and good that
Joseph did to all that land of Egypt, in the great famine mentioned in Genesis,
be the fourth and last cause of this affliction. And this indeed, if you mark
it, is a mother of great mischief wheresoever it is, even this forgetting of
such benefits as we ought, never to forget. This makes the child undutiful
to his parents, because he forgets what they have done for him: which made
the old father Tobiah call upon his son earnestly to remember what his
mother suffered for him when he was in her body, what care after when he was
brought into the world, to make much of her as long as she lived, and when she
should die to bury her by him. The good father doubted not but due remembrance
would work gratitude, as he well knew unkind forgetfulness would do ye
contrary. This is the sin of servants to their Masters, and of Masters
often to their servants. Of one neighbor toward another, and of all the world
almost this day. But could such service, may you think, as Joseph did to Egypt
be ever forgotten? yea, yea, we see it here noted by God himself: and
therefore we must know it for truth, that ingratitude will make no bones to
swallow up any virtue, any merit, any goodness whatsoever. Which causes a
saying to be most true, Si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris: if thou can truly
say he is unthankful, in that one word thou have said all the evil of him
that may be spoken. Honorable therefore was it and thrice honorable in King
Henry the 3. King of this land, so to remember the services of his oppressed
servant Hubert Lord chief Justice of England, and thereupon to free him from
the malice of his enemies, and to save his life.

I see no reason (says he) why we should deal so hardly with Hubert (when his
enemies urged his execution, and expected the Kings commandment for the same,)
for first, from the time of his youth he served mine Uncle, King Richard, and
then my father, King John: in whose service, as I heard say, beyond the seas he
was driven to eat his horse, and in my time he has stood constantly in the
defense of yt Realm against foreign Nations, kept the Castle of Dover
against king Lewis, and vanquished the Frenchmen upon the seas, also at
Bedford and Lincoln he has done great service. If he should be guilty of
any thing done untruly against me, which is not evidently proved, yet by me
he shall never be put to such a villainous death. For I had rather be accounted
a king foolish and simple, than to be judged a tyrant and seeker of blood,
especially of such, as have served me and my Ancestors in many perils so
dangerously, weighing more the few evils which yet be not proved, than so many
good deserts both to me and the whole Realm, evidently known unto all men. As
then remembrance and forgetfulness of a good are contrary, so you see the
effects of them are contrary: the one bringing forth all honorable actions,
the other oppression and cruelty, as in this place. These were the four
causes of this great affliction of Gods people, and let us never forget them,
nor their use.

3. In the next place let us note their manner in bringing their purpose to
pass: first, they have a meeting and a consultation, How the wicked use to
work.
then an exeeution of what they have devised. Their meeting the king caused,
when he said, Come, let us work wisely, etc. In which we see the guise of the
world, the wicked have a Come as well as the godly, but far and far
differing: for the godly have their Come as a word of encouragement to
religion, and the exercises thereof, as when they say: O come and let us sing
unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoice in the strength of his salvation. But the
wickeds Come, is to conspiracy and practice: in which they are more diligent,
than the children of light are in their good: for their bodies meet, their
heads meet, their hearts meet, and both outward and inward they are earnest
in evil. Such a Come we read of against holy Jeremy: Come, said the wicked,
and let us imagine a devise against Jeremy, let us smite him with the tongue,
and not give credit to any of his words. Such another have Kuffians and Ier.
18.
theenes and swaggering fellows in the book of the Proverbs: Come and cast in
thy lot with ours, for we will have all but one Prou. 1.
purse, etc. Such another has the harlot to the young man, Come, my husband is
not at home, etc. But against such cursed Prou. 7.
Comes, let us ever remember what the Psalm says, Blessed Psalm. 1. ver. 1.
is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand in
the way of sinners, and has not sit in the seat of the scornful. And that
Arnobius an old Writer well notes upon those words. Primus psalmus vnde scit
beatitudinem perijsse, inde recuperat. In consilio impiorum abijt Adam, id est,
in serpentis et mulieris. Et nunc Adam noster, id est, consensus noster, beatus
erit, si non abierit in consilio serpentis et mulieris, id est, inconsilio
carnis et diaboli, aut si abierit, non ibi stet, aut si steterit, non sedeat,
etc. The first Psalm, says he, where it knew happiness was lost, there
begins to recover it again: for Adam walked in the counsel of the wicked,
namely, of the woman and of the serpent. And now our Adam, that is, our
consent, shall be blessed, if it do not walk in the counsel of the woman and
of the serpent, that is, of flesh and the devil, or if it happen to walk, yet
stands not still, or if it stand still, yet sits not down in the same,
that is, abides not and tarieth in it, but remembering the law of the Lord,
takes his delight therein, and in the same does exercise himself both day and
night. This cursed conuenticle and malicious meeting, albeit wholely it
sauoreth of cruelty and blood, yet, if you mark it, it is covered and smeared
over with a vizard and die of wisdom: for Come, faith the King, let us wisely
work. So still is the Devil like himself, if you mark it, and ever in his
colors. His followers learn of him, and they also delight in colors. The
proud man is cleanly, the covetous man is provident, the drunkard a
good fellow, and such like. But the day will come wherein all such colors will
be washed away: and the clear sun breaking out, and dispiersing all clouds,
sin will be discerned to be sin, and eternally punnished. Thus of their
meeting and their counsel.

4 The conclusion and resolution of their counsel, if you mark The wicked lay
burdens on the godly.
the text, is to lay burdens upon this people, and to keep them down.
Burdens of labors, as appears, and burdens of payments, as some write. So
that by this way their strength should be shaken, and their lives made
wearisome unto them, that thereby less increasing might be amongst them, and
less fear had of them. Where mark if you do not see the devises of some in
our days, wise, as they think, but herein wicked, as we know, seeking by
such practices to break both backs and hearts of those that deserve better
then themselves, as if they had been Egiptians borne, and not Christians
acquainted with the book of God. Whom I make no doubt (if they hold on their
way) but the Red Sea will devour, as it did these, that is, the Justice of God
will destroy them for their sin. Till then patience, and a continual
comfortable remembrance that God sits at the stearne, which surely is enough
to any that knows how sweet he is to all that fast and faithfully cleave
unto him.

5 What is the event? to keep them under is the plot, but will it hold? O
comfort! O comfort I say again! No, no, their Wicked devises against the godly
fail of effect when God will.
devise will not hold, for the Lord sitting in the heavens, laughed all their
counsels to scorn, And the more they vexed them, the more they multiplied and
grew, says the text. A thing never to be thought of enough. So has it been,
so shall it be to the worlds end, with all faithful servants of God as shall
be fit. In those bloody persecutions after Christ's death by the Roman
Emperors, what strange torments were devised to keep down religion and
religious professors, men and women? They plucked off their skins quick,
they boared out their eyes with wimbles, they broiled them alive on Grid^rons,
they scalded them in boiling liquors, they enclosed them in barrels, and
driving great nails through, tumbled them down mountains, till their own
blood so cruelly drawn out stifled and choked them in the barrel, women's
breasts were seared off with burning irons, their bodies rent, and their joints
racked with many and many grievous pains. But would all this serve? no, no,
even as here, so then the more they were vexed, the more they multiplied
through the mercy and power of him that gave them strength to endure the
pain, and to scorn the malice. So that S. Augustine says of those times:
Ligabantur, vrebantur, cadebantur et tamen multiplicabantur, they were bound,
they were burned, they were beaten, etc. and yet they multiplied. The blood of
Martyrs is the seed of the church, and brings forth fruit as seed does,
some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred fold, as God pleases. His arm
shortneth not at any time, we all know, and therefore what he will suffer the
devil and his instruments to do, that they can, and no more. They have worn
the crowns of Kingdoms at last, to the joy of thousand thousands, in despite
of all malice, who were thrust sore, at that they might fall, and from an
honorable rising could not the malice of all Joseph's brethren keep him.
Therefore says the text, they were ver. 12.
the more grieved against the children of Israel. And so usually falls out
to those that seek their security by wicked ways. God crosses, and their
devises turn to their own further woe and coffeehouse, according to the
common proverb, Malum consilium consultori pessimum, evil counsel is always
worse to him that gives it.

6 Will they then give over their wicked ways and suffer The wicked are
obstinate in evil.
them to increase, whom God will have to increase? No, but they add unto their
cruelty more and more: in such sort as the Israelites are weary of their
lives, by sore labor in clay and brick, and in all work in the field, with
all manner of bondage, ver. 14.
which they laid upon them most cruelly, and that their iniquity might be
full, they devise a cruelty never heard of before, to send for the Midwiues
and to deal with them to destroy the male-children of ye Israelites at ye
birth. Which may rightly ver. 15.
teach us to beware ever how we begin to do evil, for fear one evil pull on
another as here it did; and in David again, when adultery drew on murder of
an innocent man, and a faithful subject. But did the Midwiues obey his
commandment? No, they fear God, says the text, and did not as the king
commanded them, but preserved alive the men-children, justly commended for that
they rather obeyed God, than man. They considered what stood with the law of
God, which to them was Act. 5.
known, and not what pleased a misled mind of a governor. Kings are to be
obeyed and pleased, but in the Lord. And if further they will force us, our
bodies are theirs to sustain undeserved pain, but both body and soul shall
die, if we sin against God. This did those happy men know and follow, when
they were threatened, and at last thrust into that fiery furnace by great
cruelty, saying, as you read there; Our God is able to deliver us, if it
please him, but if not, yet know, O King, that we will not do this thing
being wicked idolatry to worship the moulten image. The reason of the Midwiues
refusal is alleged, the fear of God. And surely wheresoever this bank is,
the waters of ungodliness are held out from euerflowing, as where the bank is
not, they do. When Abraham once entertained the thought, that in the king of
Gerar his court, the fear of God was not, straight he doubted violence both
to himself, and to his wife: and so offended in saying she was his sister.
This fear made Joseph that he durst not sin against his master or against
his brethren when his father was dead. This fear is the beginning of wisdom,
and a good understanding have all they that do thereafter, the praise of it
endures for ever. Still then labor to keep this fear in your heart, and you
shall reap a comfortable reward of it at the last.

7. What then became of the Midwiues? how escaped they How the Midwiues escaped
the kings wrath.
the Kings wrath, disobeying his commandment? Surely the text says, the King
sent for them, and they by an untruth excused themselves, saying: The Hebrewe
women were so strong, that they were delivered before any midwife came. Where,
in the King, we may learn this good, not to condemn any before we hear
them: for, if so wicked a man as this King was, had yet that justice, to send
for them and to hear their defense, much more should we that know more, do
the like. Many swelling tales and strange reports have feeble proof, when
hearing is granted. Secondly, in the Midwiues we may see the weakness of our
natures, for they should not have lied for any fear: and therefore though a
good deed be done, yet it is ill defended. We may not lie, says the
scripture, to justify God, much less for any other cause. This weakness then
in these good women was like a spot in a fair face: and S. Augustine says of
them, Viues conseruare natos fuit miserecordiae, at pro vita sua mentit as
esse, opus fuit infirmitatis, quam Deus gratia condonat. Homines vero non nisi
ingrati et proterui possunt adexemplum imitationis sibi proponere. To preserve
alive the children, was a work of mercy, but to lie for the safety of their
lives, was a work of infirmity, which yet God pardoned by grace, and none,
saving unthankful and crooked persons, will ever propose it to themselves to
be imitated.

8. But the text says, God prospered the midwiues, and built them houses: what
is that? Domus nomine in scripturis, non solum habitationis locus, sed et filij
quibus, tanquam lapidibus, domus seu familia How God built houses for the
Midwiues.
construitur and crescit, and resetiam familiaris intelligi possunt: vnde
quidam copiosam sobolem eis dedisse affirmant, vt Eusebius: and Hugo de Sto.
victore. Hyeron: innuit aedificasse eis spirituales domus. Thom. quod conuersae
fuerunt ad cultum very dei. Eusebius. Caesarien: aedificasse domus non manu
factas, sed in coelis sitas etc. The meaning usually received is, he blessed
their families, that they became of great reputation, which were descended of
them. And he stirred up the hearts of the Israelites to build them houses
which descended to their families, and were fit for them. By the phrase then of
speech let us learn thus much, ever to lift up our eyes to God for any thing
that happens to us, albeit man be the means which he uses, for ever it is
the Lords work. Such a phrase was that in Genesis, God made them aprons or
coats of skins, when themselves were the workers, and God the author of the
devise. Did we thus see God in all we enioie, it could not be, but thankful
thoughts would arise in our hearts, and more care to please him than appears
now in many an one. Prosecute this meditation with your self, and think of
your own particular, what God has donefor you, and what you render to him
again, etc.

I will cast my heart upon another thing, me think, here Note this well
most comfortable, namely, how God rejected not the good that was in these
women for the imperfection that was mingled with it, but pardoning what was
weak, graciously rewards what was well. Fear not you then though all be
not in you as you wish, but pray as you can, read as you can, hear as you
can, and all other Christian duties do them as you can, according to that
measure of grace which you have received: and, if any infirmity thrust it self
in, and trouble you, when you are most desirous to be free from it, fear not:
the Lord shows in these women what his nature is. He knows our mould
whereof we be made, and he turns away his face from beholding our fraileties,
casting a grations countenance upon our good. Frailty is ours, our weldooing
is his: and his own grace he will reward. You are not greater than ye Apostle
was who yet groaned (you know) under this burden, that he could Romans 7.
not do the good which he would, but still slipped into the evil which he would
not. Tyrannize not then over your self, but know it for a truth, that want to
do all, disgraceth not a will to do some thing with a sweet God. Often
remember that place in the Kings, so full of comfort. He only (says the Lord)
shall go to the grave in peace, because in him there is some goodness. 1.
King. 14. 13.
Some goodness, I say again, and ever have you it in your remembrance: for
not, some goodness, shall loose his reward with God, though all be not there.
Your will would do better, and that he sees, but you fail as a child of
Adam, and that he sees also, yet will not see it, to stop any mercy from
your, some goodness. Ifhee then be so sweet, be not you sower against your
self, but cheerfully doing what you can, say for your wants with him in the
Gospel which felt infirmity as you do: Lord, help my unbelief: Lord, help
my weakness every way, for thy mercy sake.

9 Lastly, when the King saw he could not have his will that way, then he
commanded that every man-child should be cast into the river as soon as it
was borne, and of like appointed bloody searchers for that purpose. So, when
craft can When craft cannot, fury and force must.
not, rage must, increasing their malice against the Lord and his poor
members, never thinking how hard it is to kick against the prick. Such a like
bloody attempt made Herod, when he flew the children, but yet missed of his
purpose, as did here this King. Let his power to prevent his foes, be the
comfort of all his true servants ever. Thus may we profit by this chapter.

CHAP. 2.
In this chapter consider chiefly these three heads. The birth of Moses and
his bringing up. His flying away from Egypt. His marriage.


1. TOuching the birth of Moses, it is noted, that both by father and mother he
It is a strange kindred that has none evil ofit.
was of the tribe of Leui: and what Leui, the son of Jacob, did, we read in
Genesis 34. 25. verse. The blemish whereof claue unto his posterity after: yet
now you see, God honors it with this great honor, that of that Tribe should
come this famous Deliverer of the whole Nation from such cruel bondage as now
they endured. An honor surely very great, and we may well note in it the
sweet goodness of Almighty God, who, though some of a Tribe have offended him,
and left cleaving to their name that blacknes and blot which the rest of their
name never occasioned, yet is not for ever alienated thereby from the whole
blood, but extends mercy and favor, yea very high honor to some of them
as he shall think good, wiping out by degrees what foul sin had wiped on
too wickedlie. How may men pray then in comfort ever? O Lord, O Lord, remember
not the offenses of them that have gone before us, but let mercy reach,
notwithstanding their evil, to those that heartily defied their evil. This
example of God, both good Princes and all good Christians carefully follow,
not hurting one for another, when like deserving makes them not in like sort
punishable. Nevertheless, some there be, that, forgetting it, maintain by an
evil name of deadly feud, as they call it, a damnable revenge upon many, and
for many years, against which is the form of prayer taught us by Christ,
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us, with
many scriptures more.

2. It is said, his mother hid him three months, and Origin makes this use of
it, that men be careful not to do all things A most woeful estate of the
Church.
to be seen of men, but as the scripture teaches, to shut the door and to
pray in secret, not to let the left hand know what the right hand does: for
fear, least, if these male-children be exposed to the view of men, with a
longing desire to win praise, the Egiptians catch them and cast them into the
river. But rather think you by these words of the woeful estate wherein this
people of God then lived. What fulness of fury was this, so bloodilie to
tyrannize over newborn Infants, were they never so sweet and well favored,
that their parents must hide them, if they would enjoy them but a day? O
bittertimes! O woeful mothers, when they saw themselves once conceived with
child! for if it were a man-child, their eyes must see the murderers take it,
and though it wept upon father and mother, and lifted up both little hands and
eyes in the pittifullest manner that it could, thereby desiring to be saved from
the destroyer, yet could they not help, it must away to the river, to the
river, it must be drowned without all remorse and pity. Let it work in our
hard hearts some true feeling of our happy freedom from such misery, and
earnest prayer to the God of mercy, that ever he would continue freedom unto
us.

3. It is said also the child was fair. What God had appointed him for, you
know: and now see, how the Lord gave, what with men might give him more grace.
Virtue in a fair body is more acceptable. And often in children appears
some sign Valor. Max. lib. 3. cap. 1.
of future virtue, wherewith God purposes to endue them when they are men.
Beauty and comeliness either in men or women is the gift of God, but a greater
gift it is to have grace withal to live virtuously. Sarai, Rebecca, Rachel,
among women were very fair and most virtuous withal. Solomon speaks of
others beautiful also, but not good. Prou. 6. 27. Prou. 11. 22. Joseph, Saul,
Absolon, among men were goodly personages, but Joseph's piety was more
glorious, than all his beauty. Thank GOD for his mercy in your self and
your children: and, to supply all defects, beseech him in your prayer: you
shall find the comfort and the benefit of it. If favor be but hard, remember
S. Bernard: It is a happy blacknes Foelix nigredo, quae mentis candorem habet.
in body, which is accompanied with a whiteness in mind. Many have been
hard favored, and yet endued with excellent parts. Philopaemen, a Grecian

very deformed, excelled most men in Military matters. Acsope, very hard
favored, yet most witty. Socrates, full of imperfections in shape, and yet who
more famous for wisdom? Apollo his oracle gave him pre-eminence. Thus might I
tell you many Stories: but you see the Meditation sufficiently, follow it
further, as you see cause. Blessed be God, that every way gives us comfort.
Xerxes, Heredotus. lib. 7.
that had that huge army, yet is said to have been the goodliest man of them
all. Plutarch, in the life of Demetrius says, he was so passing in face and
countenance, that no Painter or Picture-maker was able to draw him. Of Scipio
Africanus, he says, that the Barbarians in Spain stood amazed at his
comeliness. Suetonius writes of the goodly Eye of Augustus Caesar. What an
excellent personage Charles the great had, Paulus Aemilius shows in his third
book. Maximilian the first had such a Presence and Majesty, that a stranger
is said, among 30. great Princes, to have noted him out, having never seen him
before. But I forget my self, out of a desire to give you occasion to think
of more.

4. But was only the fairness of the child, that made the mother hide him?
No, every creature thinks his own, fair. This therefore is somewhat, but
not all, Nature had a sway: and yet, above all, Gods Spirit tells us of
another thing, which we must mark, namely, of faith. For, by faith, says he,
by the Apostle to the Hebrews, Moses, Heb. 11. 23.
when he was borne, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he
was a proper child, neither feared they the Kings commandment. Faith
believed that God would one day release them, and not any longer suffer them so
cruelly to be oppressed. In hope therefore of the same, they used means,
hiding him, as they could, and leaving the success to God. Their eyes could
not see any way of safety, much less that way, which after fell out: but
their hearts hoped, their souls prayed, and upon him they fixed both heart and
soul, who is Almighty, Allmercifull, All-sweete and kind: to his distressed
servants then nearest, when he seems furthest; then strongest, when he
seems weakest; then sweetest, when he seems lowrest; and then up in wrath
to revenge our wrongs, when the world does think he has forgotten us. Such
faith then let us mark, and pray for, in the evil day: doubt not the Lord,
distrust not his help, shift along in his holy fear with such lawful means,
as you possibly can: commend the blessing of them to him, and let him ever do
his own will.

5. But (alas) she could not long keep him thus. Three months she did it by
secret hiding: but then, says the Story, she could no longer: so cruel were
their hearts, and so narrow was the search, that he must away, a case more
than bitter, as has been said. But what help now for this guiltless babe?
See an excellent woman, An excellent woman.
full of faith in her God: when she could no longer hide him, she devised for
him a little arc made of reed, and dawbed it with (...) and pitch, putting
the child in it, and setting it among the bulrushes by the river side,
appointing her daughter (the child's sister) to watch the same: so committing
that thing to her mighty God, which her self could not keep from a bloody
tyrant, never yielding, but in hope still, even as it were past hope, depended
faithfully and constantly upon her God for the safety of her child.

6. And what did the father all this while, that the scripture still mentions
the mother, saying, she did, and she did? Truly of like all vexed, amazed,
and tormented with she woe of it, stood as a man shiftlesse, not seeing what
to do. The woman enabled by God, is the better man, quicker and prompter for
devise in so touching an extremity: Women's wits have often great effects in
extremity.
she deuiseth what he likes, and she performs what God blesses. In the
weaker vessel Gods strength was more seen, and he does enable them now and
then for that purpose. The knowledge of it must yield them a fit regard, and
men may not ever disdain to follow them, by whom they see God sometimes does
work. Many men have been well advised by their wives; and the woman's
counsel not followed, you read in Scripture, has turned sometimes to the
man's woe. You remember the particular, Have not thou to do with that iustman,
with diverse others.

7. The child thus placed by the water side, and his sister watching a far
off, as though she knew not of it, to see what would become of her little
brother, what falls out? O depth of Gods mercy and goodness! down comes
that way, to wash her self in ye river, Pharaohs daughter, even this cruel
Pharaohs daughter, called of some Thermutis, and walking by the river side with
her maids, spies the arc among the bul-rushes, and sent her maid to fetch
it: when she opened it, behold little Moses in it, and the poor babe wept
upon her, begging by tears (as well as it could) some mercy and pity
against the bloody law of her father. She had compassion, and conceived
rightly, that it was one of the Hebrews children. By all which, what may we
learn, but first, that there is no rock more sure, nor refuge more
comfortable (when man's power fails) than Gods gracious providence? (for there
is no temptation so great, whereunto that cannot give an issue.) Secondly, how
able God is, to dispose of men and women's courses, otherwise, than at the
beginning they intended? (for this Lady purposed only to walk and wash her,
but God had a work of mercy to do by her; her purpose was one thing, and the
Lords was another.) Often thus (...) Truly, so often as any man or woman hear
their own name, they are accused of these things, if they be guilty. A
promise so broken, being made to God in the face of the congregation, will
trouble the soul sore at the hour of death.

11. Finally, we see plainly by this whole discourse, how man's counsel can
not hinder that, which God has determined shall come to pass. For there is no
counsel, no wisdom, no strength against the Lord. Moses must live, and become
a Deliverer to that people, do Pharaoh what he can. And though many poor
infants were cast away to prevent his fear, yet that Infant which must effect
what he so feared, is preserved alive in despite of him, yea nourished up by
his own daughter, in his own bosom, to the wonder of all that read it, to
the worlds end. The like you may remewber of Herod and those infants; but this
is enough of the first part of this chapter.

The second part.
1. NOw follows the second part; namely, of his departure both from Court
and Country, which happened when he was forty years old, as Stephen Act 7.
23.
witnesses. And, if any marvel, why it was so long? of all the reasons that
are alleged, it seems best, that, till that time, he had not his Calling
from God to begin that work. He might consider his own birth and
parentage, his great preservation and education, his Nations misery and
bondage, and heartily pity them; but, that he was of God appointed to them a
Deliverer, he knew not, till God revealed it, and God revealed it not, till
now, as it should seem; for Stephen says, it came into his mind, when he was
thus old, to visit his brethren; as if he should say, he now felt his
calling and not before.

2. When he did feel it, and that once the Spirit of God smote his heart, then
mark we, how no honors, no pleasures, no riches could keep him in the Court
any longer, but he rather chose to suffer adversity with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, Heb. 11. 25.
esteeming the rebukes of Christ greater riches, than the treasures of Egypt.
For he had respect unto the recompense of the reward. A notable example for all
Courtiers and men of high place, that they suffer themselves not to be snared
with any thing incident to their places so, that they may not serve ye living God
as they ought. For surely, if either pleasure or profit draw from him, it is
too dearly bought, Courtiers and great personages.
and will lie heavy upon their souls one day. Their dissembling there, can
never profit Gods people, as their open profession would do. But, in stead of
profiting, it draws many thousands to death with them, who observe their
steps, and depend upon them: which will be laid to their charge in that
great day of the Lord, when Moses shall live, and they die: Not all the glory
they possessed in this world being able to procure them one drop of water to
cool their tougues.

3. When he came to his brethren, he saw their bitter servitude, burdens and
slavery out of measure: he saw many great abuses offered unto them, wherewith
he was so far moved, that he laid his hands upon one of the Egyptians, and
sieve him. Not so teaching private men to do without authority, what he did,
warranted by a Calling: but rightly teaching Magistrates, which have calling to
use their Places to the relief of the oppressed, and instrucing all men as
their Places will warrant them, to help their brethren from just oppressors.

4. But his looking about him on every side, when he did it, and hiding him
that was slain, argue, as you may think, an evil conscience, and prove in
him an unlawful act. No indeed, no more than it does in other Magistrates,
that they execute justice upon some early, or late, or privately, to avoid
sedition and tumult. This was in Moses, and in them, a godly wisdom,
providing warely, that whiles they endeavor a good, by some indiscreet
handling, there grow not an evil. Some fear, if you will, I deny not to have
been in Moses, when he did it: and it may truly teach us the weakness that
sometimes is in the best servants of God, in the very warranted works of their
lawful calling, to our comfort, if we feel the like. And, which is sweet
also, that God does not ^ast away obedience performed to him with some fear
more than it should. We are not greater than Moses: and therefore, (praying
for strength, and doing our best, if some vnwished weakness show it self)
let this example be remembered.

5. It is said in the text, that Moses came forth again the second day: and
thereby all Magistrates may learn constancy and continuance in their care for
their people. For it is not enough one day to come and see how all goes, as at
their first entrance upon their Office, or otherwise; but even the second day
they should do the same, and so day by day, as occasion serves, during the
time of their Charge. The want whereof makes many a one wring, that by more
diligence would be righted and relieved.

6. But how was he requited? Surely finding two striving together, and
admonishing them to cease from such unbrotherly strife, straight he was
reproached by one of them, in this sort: Who made thee a man of authority, and
a Judge over us? Think thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? A
clear glass for all eyes to see in, the reward often given to good men, when
they have performed some good duties to their brethren. But it may be no
discouragement: for GOD is in heaven, and will reward all obedience to him,
paying home heavily such unthankful receivers of it.

7. Was this all? no, mark more in these unkind Israelites. The death of the
Egyptian is brought to Pharaohs care: so that now Moses, for his zeal and
heart to Solent reges abundare auribus. Xenophon.
relieve his countryman that was abused, must either himself fall into
danger, or fly the country to his disgrace. Not only therefore the
unthankfulness, but the measure of it is to be observed, for our good. For
many times we can digest some ingratitude, but such a measure and such a
manner, as is happily offered unto us, we caunot. This example will help us:
for sure the measure here was great, and the manner odious. Again, for
whiblers and prattling pick-thanks, tatlers, and tale-tellars, there may be a
Note of them. You see what an ancient weed in the world they be: they were
never wanting, nor will be, while ye world indureth: neither Princes, nor
meaner than Princes can avoid them: there is no news stirring, but they are
carriers of it, and they can greatly iucrease it in the carriage. No
circumstances can make them silent. Many good men have smarted by them: and now
Moses, yon see, tastes of them. Who is he or she, that have not some way by
these walking tongues been wounded? I leave you to your own experience of this
venom.

8. Whither flies Moses then, from this raging storm of Pharaohs displeasure
raised up against him by these pratlers? Into the land of Midian, says the
text, where the Lord provided for him. Then mark with your self, how always
one place or other the Lord has for his servants. If Iudaea be dangerous for
the child Jesus, in Egypt he shall find safety, til ye time appointed, and so
forth read 2. Cor. 4. 8.

9. When he was come thither, He sat him down by a well: a place most like to
bring some to him, of whom he might inquire, how he might bestow himself. But
God knows what thoughts the circumstances of his case procured unto him. His
calling he saw, not acknowledged of his countrymen: but in stead thereof his
life brought in question, and therefore might fall into some doubt of it
himself. All his worldly comforts were now departed from him, and he a poor
exile in a strange country, not knowing which way to turn him. A great change
from so high a place as Moses had in Egypt, being esteemed the Son of
Pharoahs daughter: and lesser alterations than this, we well know, have given
good men shrewd plucks: yet read we of no discomfort in Moses, which we must
observe, and be bettered by it. GOD humbles him in his worldly estate, and
brings him to this low ebb: yet forsakes him not, but dearly loves him,
and has great honors in store for him again, when time comes. We are
likewise the Lords, and we must be content, that he do with us his own
good pleasure ever.

The third part.
1. THe third part of the chapter follows: concerning his marriage in that
land, the manner whereof you may read in your chapter, verse. 16. etc. Some
blame him as matching with the unbelieving, others excuse him, saying, they
were not unbelievers. The scripture is silent, and therefore we need not to be
curious. To excuse the godly Fathers ever, is more than can be, to make Iethro
and his household such believers as they ought to be, with whom we join in
marriage. How beit happily he was better than thousands there. Theoderet says,
Typus erat Is more then has sound proof.
Christi domini, qui, cum ex Iudeis secundum carnem natus esset, ecclesiam
Gentium appelauit sponsam suam. Moses herein was a type of Christ, who, being
borne of the Jews according to the flesh, married himself to the Gentiles and
Theod. in Ex. cap. 2.
ralled them his spouse. But leave we it as not profitable to us to scanne what
God has pleased to conceal. And mark the heart of Iethro when he understood
how Moses had helped his daughters at the well, very kindly he conceived of
that favor, and chid them for so leaving him, and not bringing him home to
eatebread. Surely the Spirit of God does not so still in every place note this
kindness of heart in requiting love, but that he exceedingly likes it, and
would have all his, ever to follow it.

2 Of his wife the Lord gave him a son whose name he called Gershom, adding
the reason, because, says he, I have been a stranger in a strange land. So
then, that which many object oftentimes to Gods children by way of reproach,
that they are strangers, exiles, and so forth, that, Moses takes to be no
reproach, and therefore gives the title of it to his son for his name. An
example to teach us never to be ashamed either of banishment or any hard
estate wherewith God shall exercise us for his glory, but rather to rejoice in
it and comfortably to think of it, as Moses does here. The shame is theirs
that reproach us, the glory is ours, if we rightly endure it.

3. In process of time this blody Pharaoh dies, says the Story, and this is
a comfort to the godly, as likewise it should be a warning to all oppressors of
them, they shall die and be packing, and shall not continue to deal cruelly.
Then shall they receive the wages of their wickedness, and they whom they have
wronged shall be comforted. The rod of the ungodly lights upon the
faithful, as God shall please: but the Lord has said, it shall not carry upon
them. And what sweeter comfort, but the rod of Gods justice shall both light
and lie vnremooueable upon the ungodly that repent not of their evil, and what
greater woe? Let them beware then whiles there is time.

4. But when was it, that he dyed? Surely, forty years after Moses fled
thence. Moses was forty when he fled, and eighty when he came as their
Deliverer. Let it thus profit us. You remember before, how Moses began to
exercise that. Office toward their relief, which he was certified God had
appointed him unto, and thought, that they would have acknowledged it with
thanks to God for him. But they most unkindly requited him, and so endangered
him, that he was fame to fly to save his life. When he so began, God offered
them mercy: when they so rewarded him, what followed? Surely, forty years
more the continuance of their bondage and misery. A singular warning to all
feeling hearts to beware the reiection of Gods mercy when it is offered. For it
ever has a sure punishment, and well worthy. Consider you particularly Gods
dealing with your self, what has he offered? what does he yet offer you?
what have you done? or, what yet do you? Be wise, and ponder. Surely God is
kind to offer, but he is just to revenge any wilful contempt of his Offers,
with continuance of bitter woe here, or forever.

5. When he was dead, the people cried to the Lord and sighed, says the text.
Such sobbes in sorrow were due to them that rejected and would not see what God
offered them of ease. But O comfort! yet what see we again? Surely, says the
text, God heard them, remembered his covenant, looked unto them and respected
them. Sweet Father, so is it ever with thee, just to correct, but gracious to
give over: not ever offended, but in due time entreated: pitiful, loving, and
of endless mercy. Many things more might this Chapter yield us, most worthy
noting: but, I remember, for whom I write, and I would not make the volume
great, that I wish bought and used of poor ones; the abler persons may have
many better helps. A taste of the comfort of Gods word, and the use thereof,
(to encourage to the buying of Bibles and reading of them) is the thing I
desire to give: and that is done, by something upon every Chapter, though it be
not much, fitted, as God inhableth me, for the feeling and comfort of them,
for whom I labor. Let this much therefore suiffice upon this Chapter.

CHAP. 3.
The chief Heads of this Chapter be these. The calling of Moses. His speech
with God.


1. MOses kept the sheep of Iethro; and is not this a great change, from an
adopted son of a kings daughter, to become a shepherd to a mean man? From
the rauishing pleasures of a Kings Court, to come to lie under a bush, and
behold but sheep? To talk with his flock, and sport with his dog, insteede
of all he inioied before? To ruffle in his Russet, sit for that office, with
adiu to garments of former honor? O sweet experience, if need require, of
the estate of one most dear to God! Sink not (my heart) so low in my body for
fear of a change. Fear not that fall, that hurts not with God. These
earthly shows, as the shining Sun, flashe their beams abroad, and fly upon
the soddaine into the cloud, as if they had never been. But thy God is all one
with them, and without them: nay, often time more near thee, the further thon
art from them, as this very Example may assure thee, if thou mark it. For in
all the glory of his earthly honor, Moses had not such a conference with his
God, as now, that he is a poor shepherd, guiding and leading another man's
flock. David, by cutting away a piece of Saul's garment, made him remember
himself a little better: and God many times, by cutting away some part of our
former estate, makes us profitably feel, what we felt not before, of sweet
consolation in him, and his hea (...) was some shadow and figure. Theoderet is
of the same mind, whose words are these. Vniuersus locus demonstrat deum esse,
qui apparuit. Dicitur Angelus, vt cognoscamus, quod is, qui visus est, non est
Deus Pater (cuius enim Angelus esset Pater) sed vnigenitus Filius, qui magni
consilij est Angelus, qui sacris discipulis dixit; Omnia quaecunque audiui
apatre meo, nota fecivobis. Quemadmodum autem Angeli nomen posuit, non quidem
volens ministrorum quempiam innuere, sed personam vnigeniti demonstrare: sic
iterum ipsius tum naturam, tum potentiam praedicat, inquiens ipsum dixisse: Ego
sum qui sum, et Ego Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, Deus Jacob, etc. The whole
place, says he, shows it was God: but he is called an Angel, that we
might know, that he which was seen, was not God the father (for whose Angel
should the Father be) but the only begotten Son of God, which is the Angel
of the great Counsel, which said to his holy Apostles; All things which I
have heard of my Father, I have declared unto you. And even as he gave him the
name of an Angel, not meaning thereby to note any other minister or
messenger, but to show the person of the only begotten Son: so again he
sets forth both his nature and power, saying he said: I AM THAT I AM, and I
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, etc. Hillarie also
speaks to this effect in his book of the Trinity. Gregory thought it was an
Angel in the person Greg. in praefat. moral. cap. 2. Aug. quest. 3. in Exodus
et 2. de Trin. cap. 13.
of God. Augustine varieth in his opinion, etc. Touching this manner of
appearing, it may occasion us to remember how God uses to apply himself unto
the purpose and intent of his appearing, whenever it pleases him to manifest
himself unto men. For, in the Prophet Esaias, he is said to have appeared like a
Judge, sitting upon a high throne: because, as then, the judgment of Israel
approached Esaias. 6. 1.
and drew near. At the Baptism of Christ, it pleases the holy Ghost to
appear like a Dove, because Math. 3. 16.
that form might show the innocence and mild nature of our Savior. In the
Acts of the Apostles, like Tongues, Act. 2. 3.
because now the tongues of the Apostles were to be framed, Acts. 2. 3.
as it were, a new: like cloven tongues, because the benefit was to be divided
unto all Nations: like fiery tongues, because their speech, by the gracious
working of GOD his holy Spirit, should hereafter kindle in the hearts of men,
as it were, a fire, that is, an hot and burning hatred of sin, a love of
rightcousnesse, and all holy obedience acceptable to God. And now, here, like
a bush burning, but not consumed, that it might declare the state present of
his people in Egypt and the condition of his Church unto the end of the world.
His people in Egypt even burning in the furnace of Pharaohs cruelty and
oppression, and yet not consumed for all that, through the mighty power and
gracious goodness of his sweet favor that vpheld them, yea, multiplied and
increased them in the very flame of it. His Church militant in like sort to
expect trouble after trouble, and one woe to another, but not to be
overwhelmed and utterly destroyed by all the malice of Hell working in wicked
instruments to ye uttermost. Quid sibi vult ardere rubum, and non exuri? Nempe,
Israelem Aegyptioru^ insidijs appetitu^, non esse subing andu^ sed aduer sarijs
superiorem futurum. What means this, says Theodoret, upon this place, that
the bush burned, and was not consumed? surely yt the Israelites be-set with ye
wrongs of the Egypptians, should yet not be overthrown, but even overcome
their adversaries. Philo, the Jewe, in the life of Moses says, there appeared
in the middle of ye flame a glorious Image, as a manifest testimony of the
Presence of God, etc.

4. When Moses saw this strange sight, he said, I will turn aside now, and
see why the bush burns not? where we may see ye good disposition of men and
minds governed with Gods fear. They do not contemn and lightly pass over
such things as they see, but they observe and mark, search and seek, what
good they may possibly draw from them. They are of a docile and apt nature to
be instructed, when as others, like deaf and dead people, are not profited by
any thing, but finally perish, whatsoever has been showed to them by God or
man. Learn we by Moses, to do as he did; and by the other to beware of
their dullness.

5. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, He called him unto Him,
etc. No sooner, then, can we show willingness to learn, but God is most
ready to instruct and teach. If we will hear, He will speak; and, if we
will know, He will declare. A sweet encouragement, ever to be willing to be
informed. And now He is called LORD and GOD, as you see, who before is said to
be an Angel, as before also, you remember, I noted. Moses, Moses, says He
familiarly and kindly: for it was ever a favor to be called by our names of
superior men, much more of God. Nathaniell maruelleth how Christ knew him, when
he spoke of him, as you John. 1. 47.
read in John: but Christ told him, that, before Philip called him, he saw him
under the fig tree. Our God, to our comfort, knows us all, and calls his
sheep by their names. Happy are we, if, as Moses here, we may ever be ready
to answer and say, I am here, Lord, or, as another says, Speake-on, Lord, for
thy, servant hears: or, as David the Propet says, my heart is ready, my
heart is ready, etc. 1. Sam. 3. 9. Psalm. 108.


6. Then he said, Come not hither, put thy shoes of thy feet: for the place
where thou stand is holy ground. First, the Lord has a care of man's
infirmity, and is willing to reveal himself as that may endure to behold, not
further, lest man, by His Majesty, should be oppressed, when, in His mercy, he
wishes him profited. Therefore, Come not hither, says He, respecting his
weakness. Secondly, he endeavors to work in Moses that reverence and
fear, which beseems Gods children, when they approach unto God: which,
although, no doubt, it was in Moses much, yet more and more is it ever
necessary for all men, if they will in deed be touched effectually with
that which is spoken and done, and be truly humbled to attend and remember. To
the same purpose is that of putting-off his shoes: for, Quare iussus est Moses
calceamenta soluere? Certe, vt religiosiorem hac ratione illum redderet. Why
was he bidden to put-off his shoes (says Theodoret?) Even, that he might
make him thereby more religiously affected. It is also noted, how needful it
is (if ever we will perform unto GOD that reverence that is due) to put-off
that corruption and sin, wherewith in this life we are clogged. Which, as
the dust to the shoe, and the shoe to the foot, cleaves to us. For the
place where thou stand, says he, is holy ground: not that the place of it
self was better than others; but that reverence and a holy fear was due unto
God in that place; both, in regard of his incomprehensible Glory, and of Moses
own natural infirmity. Holy, I say, in respect of Gods Presence, not
otherwise: and therefore, nothing, here, favors any Popish superstition
falselie ascribing to places what is not in them. The like you read in Joshua,
and Ruth, which by this may be understood, even Joshua. 5. 15. Ruth. 4. 7.
to put away all hindering affections; and to resign our selves wholely up
unto God, to hear and do his will. This is to put-off our shoes.

7. Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. At the first
he was bold, and went toward the bush to behold this matter: but now hearing
that God is there, he covers his face, and is afraid: plainly showing, that,
the more God opens himself to man, and the nearer man draws unto God, the
more he fears in a holy reverence, as more feeling and finding his own
wants and unworthiness to behold such glory. For whilst we are far from God,
we can say and think with those Laodiceans, I am rich and increased with
goods, and have Apoc. 3 17.
need of nothing, but if the Lord annoint our eyes with his eye-salue, then
we change our copy, and see as there is said, that we are wretched, and
poor, and blind, and naked: then we pray, that we may have of Gods gold to
make us rich, and white raiment, that we may be clothed, and that our
filthy nakedness do not appear. Then we cover our face, as Moses did here,
and we humbly and modestly come to hear him, trembling at his words with a
contrite spirit: well understanding that they Esaias. 66. 2.
are justly overthrown in their own pride, who rashly presume they can
conceive Gods mysteries with their own wits.

8. Having then thus prepared his Servant to humble attention, the Lord
begins his tale, and says, I have surely seen the trouble of my people,
etc. Where, every word has vehemency and matter worthy noting. He says,
he has seen, he has heard, and he knows: and how has he seen?
Videndo vidi, seeing I have seen; that is, vidi certo et serio, I have seen
certainly and seriously: verborum enim geminatione, vehementia, certitudo et
celeritas significatur, by the doubling of the word, vehemency, certainty and
celeritie is signified, says a Divine. I have seen, and so seen, as that I
can no longer hold my peace: yea, I have so seen, as that I will help, and
endure no longer. Vidisse enim dicitur compassionis oculo et miserationis
aspectu. For he is said to have seen with eye of compassion, and with a
merciful beholding, says Beda. And what have thou thus seen, Lord? Even the
trouble of my people which are in Egypt. First then, trouble and anguish is
known to thee, and there is no sorrow hid from thine eyes, be it never so
secret and hidden in the heart, enclosed in the breast and bowels of man or
woman, not daring to peep out for fear of some circumstance that might
increase our pain: but yet thou see it not so, that thou will redress it,
except they be thy people. For so thou speak in this place, that, thou have
seen the trouble of thy people. If then we would have grief seen and
helped, we must endeavor with all godly care to be thine. Which if we do,
then sighing and groaning in our several occasions, as these did, we may be
sure in due time to find our comfort, as they found. Affliction also, we may
here learn, does not show that the party is disliked of God (as Satan
often will suggest to men and women that are in trouble:) for God calls these
Israelites his people, which yet in most extraordinary affliction were
plunged. He is not as the proud Peacocks of this world, that know a man in a
gay coat and an high Office, but in poverty and baseness know him not, though
he be most near, yea, almost their own father or mother, sister or brother.
But in the poorest plight, when the back is bare, for want of clothing; the
face lean, with woe of heart, and quite altered with brinish tears, that
gushed along it, and have worn furrows in it, in stead of former hue; when
the head hangs for bitter cares; and all the bones are in a manner out of
joint, with racking tortures of bloody Tyrants; Then, even then, does the Lord
know his, and as sweetly acknowledges them for his own, as ever in any
prosperity that they enjoyed, or the chiefest comforts they ever professed.

9. From seeing, then, the Lord comes to hearing, and says, He has heard
their cry, because of their Taskmaisters; telling us, what the prayers of his
children are in his ears, even loud cries, and, cries, that are heard to
their good, in Gods due time, and to their adversaries woe, that so spitefully
and wickedly have oppressed them. Which if thou would in due time consider,
that wrongest any man, it would be good for thee, and God is merciful: if
not, consider the vehemency of his moan, that thou so dealest withal, how
God calls it a cry, a cry that awaketh him up unto judgment against thee,
and thou shall be destroyed. Thou art an oppressing, vexing Taske-maister, like
these Egyptians, and thou shall be destroyed, as God is God, without amendment,
in the Red Sea, or Black-sea of Hellish deepes: where the torment is
intolerable, and from whence no man nor means can ever deliver thee. Thy will
in this world to be gained and gotten with such a price; think of it.

10 The Lord is not satisfied, to have said, He sees and He hears, but
he adds the third, He knows. For I know their sorrows, says he. It is
our comfort, that He knows: and it may be the wickeds terror, that He
knows. Enough being said of it, I add but this, he that then saw, heard,
and knew, is the same still: No changeling in Love to his dear Chosen, no
changeling in Justice to the stubborn sinner, and be instructed by it. Our
heavenly Father knows what we have need of. Here they had need of
Deliverance; and he, therefore, knowing as well as they, comes down to give
it them according to his sweet mercy. Descendere dicitur Deus per affectu^
(loco enim no^ descendit) quando fauet nobis et auxiliatur, etc. Vel,
descendere dicitur, inquit Eusebius, quando aliquid novum, quod antea non
fuerat in creatura humana, operatur. God is said to come down, by his
affection or love (for touching place he descends not) when he favors and
helps us; or, God is said to come down, says Eusebius, when he does any new
thing, which before was not done among men.

11. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, says God to Moses,
etc. God was able to have done it himself, without Moses, or any man: but he
will use means, commonly, to effect his will; that his mercy and goodness may
be seen in his Creatures; as likewise, his power and wisdom, to his great
glory. He might also have used a far more excellent means, than Moses: as,
foam King, or great Prince in earth; or, some of his glorious Angels in Heaven,
(for so he did, when by Cyrus he wrought their Deliverance out of the
Captivity, and when by an Angel he brought Peter out of prison:) but his
purpose was in their Delivery, to make known his incomprehensible Power to
Pharaoh and many more, unto the worlds end. And therefore he would choose no
stronger a means now, than Moses, Iethro his Sheepe-keeper; knowing, how apt
man is, to obscure Gods glory, with the quality of the means; and to ascribe
unto the second cause, what only has been wrought by the first cause.
Again, this was a Figure, that from the spiritual thraldom and bondage of
death, sin, and the Devil, he should deliver his people under the Gospel,
not by the help of learned Philosophers, or any glorious worldly Potentates,
but by a company of poor Fishermen, unlettered and unthought upon in the
world.

12. But Moses said unto God, who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and
bring the Children of Israel out of Egypt? (Smitten with a sense and feeling
of his own weakness, to do such a service) which indeed is the very true
and right way to make us fit in Gods eyes. For then we sly to him, and by
faithful prayer beg and crave, what in our selves we see not, till he give
it. Such as are not thus touched and humbled, but rush into Callings rashly,
presuming on their own strength and abilities, daily Experiences show, how
often God confounds them and throws them down to their great shame. Who am
I, Lord, therefore, let us ever say, that thou should thus, and thus, think
of me, choose me, and take me to that place, that I have no strength to
manage, and which thousands of my brethren are fitter for, by super-excellency
of gifts, than I am: thus said the Kingly Prophet, David, you know, when he
looked upon Gods favors toward him. O, what am I, and my fathers house, that
thou should do thus unto me? Now, as this is most commendable humility in
Gods servant; so is it true and sound wisdom, not to look at the honor, and
forget the burden, but to see the one, as well as the other. It was a great
honor to be sent for such a service: but it was a weighty Charge, and a heavy
care, as well as an honor. What? shall I go to Pharaoh? Shall I deliver Israel?
And shall I have the leading and government of such a mighty multitude, till
God has disposed of them? Why? it is a thing that requires great strength and
many parts, that I have not. O LORD, who am I? May not this, then, a little
occasion us to think of spiritual government? for is it such a matter to
strive with Pharaoh for bodies and temporal servitude, and is it nothing to
fight with Satan and the power of Hell for souls and freedom from eternal
bondage? Is it not fearful, I will require the blood at thy Ezec. 33. 1.
Kings 3.
hand? etc. As Solomon therefore in the temporal charge saw a weighty burden,
and thereupon craved wisdom, to be able to go in and out, as he ought,
before that multitude: Ier. 1. Jonas. 1
so saw Jeremy and Jonas a great matter, when the one said, Alas! I am
achilde, and cannot speak: and the other flatly fled and refused to go.
Others have done the like, and yet Ambition pricketh forward, for all this,
many a man. Simon Magus would have been an Apostle in power for Act. 8. Math.
27.
respects; be the charge what it may be, that troubles not him. Saint Peter
iumpeth into danger, presuming of strength, but he fails and falls, he
lies and denies, and discovers his weakness greatly. Once again therefore
look we at Moses modesty and humility in this place, saying, Lord, who am I?

13. Now see, what this lowly conceit works. It gets him comfort and
strength from God; for streightway God answered him, and said, I will be with
thee: as if he should say, look not thou at thy self and thy power, but look
at me and my power. And though thou art weak, yet know me to be strong and
ever able to strengthen them whom I call to a service, to perform the same.
And I do not say to thee, that I will help thee now and then; but, I will be
with thee; that is, ever and continually I will aid ^r^ tecum.
thee in this work, even I, not any Angels of mine, but I my self; and
therefore fear not. What greater comfort might he wish? And who would not
throw himself down, thus to be raised up? or, who would not see his own
wants, thus to receive grace? Remember how in like sort he comforted Jeremy
and Ezechiel with others of the Prophets; also his Apostles after, in their
time, saying: Be of good comfort, I have overcome the world; and, I will be
with you, till the end of the world. With God al things Ero vobiscum.
are possible, etc.

4. It contenteth not the Lord to make this merciful promise of his presence
with Moses, but he further asisteth his weakness with a Sign, saying: This
shall be a token unto thee, etc. Where we may remember, yt Signs used of God to
confirm his childrens faith, sometimes go before, and sometimes follow after.
Gedeon had a Sign goingbefore namely, the fleece of wool, first wet, and
then dry. Judge. 6. Esaias. 38.
Ezechias had the like in the shadow of the dial going ten degrees back. But
in another place the same Ezechias had a Sign that followed, to wit, when, for
assurance, that he would deliver Jerusalem besieged by the Assyrians, he Esaias.
37. 30.
said: This shall be a Sign unto thee, O Ezechias, Thou shall eat this year
such as grows of it self, and the second year, such things as grow without
sowing; and in the third year, sow ye and reap and plant Vine-yardes and eat
the fruits thereof. As if he should have said, whereas (usually and by reason)
after war comes famine, because men cannot husband their grounds; yet it
shall not be so with you: but for two years, the ground it self shall feed
you, and let this suffice for a Sign of hope and comfort against this fear.
So, in this place, Moses, fear not, for I will be with thee; and, for a sign,
thou shall bring them forth and serve me in this mountain. This thou shall
see, as truly as I tell thee, and then this will be asigne that I was with thee
according to my promise. What a nature now is this in our dear GOD, thus to
submit himself to man's weakness, and in stead of chiding and punishing man
for it, to help it and stay it with all comfortable tokens and signs? O who
would not trust in this God, and believe what he promises? Nay, who has not
cause, that observes these things, to be of the Prophet David's mind? Blessed
is the man that puts his trust in him.

15. This, as it ought, contented Moses; and therefore, leaving the matter of
his own infirmity, be casts his mind next, upon the infirmity of the
Israelites, to whom he must go. And fearing lest (according to their former
backewardnesse, whereof he had tasted) they would stand in doubt of the truth
of his authority to deliver such matter from the Lord unto them, he prays
the Lord to instruct him what he shall say, if they ask him, what is his Name?
Which question was allowable in Moses, because it had relation to others, not
to himself. For, when Jacob would know the Angels name that wrestled with him,
for himself, that is, to satisste his own curiosity: he was answered,
wherefore do thou ask my Name? and it was not Genesis 32. 29
told him, yet he blessed him. So Manoah, Samsons Father, asked the Angel the
like question, and in like sort was answered; Why ask thou thus after my
Name which is secret (or wonderful?) and told him not. The reason Judge. 13. 17.
may appear in the place: because Manoah asks it that he might honor him,
not with an eye to the profit of others, as Moses did here. Therefore the Lord
answered Moses, and said; I AM THAT I AM; and thus shall thou say to the
Children of Israel, I AM has sent me unto you. That is, ye God that is no
Changeling, but the same for ever; who, as he has done for them and their
Fathers very great things; so can he again, if they will be obedient to his
will, with like power, mercy and goodness, deliver them and free them from
this bondage wherein they groan, as cruelly vexed and oppressed. See then a
sweet Comfort in all our fears, even his name, I AM. Noting, that, as he has
been to penitent sinners, so ever he will be without any change. If I turn
unto him, call upon him, and withal faithful trust of my inward soul depend
upon him; I AM is his Name, and I may not doubt of him. Have not I my self
fonnd him sweet, comfortable, and good, 10000. times, as well as other sinners?
Has not your hearts been touched by him sundry times to very good purposes?
Has not another-man found him gracious and kind in his worldly estate and
advancement to honor, when he might have passed him over, and have had choice
enough? So let every man run-ouer his private favors. How, then, may ever any
of us fall from him without most great reproof, or ever faint and fear that
he will forsake us. I AM, I say again, is his Name, and we must be taught by
it, that he is a God without all change, toward such as steadfastly cleave
unto him. The Lord, then, give us use in all our fears, of this Comfort,
strengthen our weakness to believe, and ever, in mercy, look upon us.

16. After this, he appointed Moses his Order of going, and publishing this
message: to wit, that first he should go to the Elders, and call them
together, and make them acquainted with it, before he dealt with the Common
people. Where, we must take the name of Elder, for a name of Office, (not of
years) for so we know the Scripture speaks. Not ever the oldest men bear
Office either in Church or common wealth: but, as God gives gifts, and
appoints in his providence Places unto them of government and charge; so, in
regard thereof they are called the Elders, that is, the Rulers and Governors,
(though in years something young) as Timothy and others were. Now mark we, to
our good, in this, first, that under the great tyranny of Pharaoh, yet some
liberty was given these Israelites to meet for Religion and knowledge,
instruction and understanding, according to the right way which the Lord had
acquainted them with; albeit that same, of the Egyptians, was not received nor
allowed. And how does this amplify the bloody cruelty of Antichrist, who
yields not so much to his Fellow Christians, I mean, to people professing
Christ (as he pretends he does) as bloody Pharaoh yielded to ye Jews, who
joined not in profession with him? Secondly observe we the Wisdom, liked and
prescribed of God for a Rule ever to guide our selves by, and our actions: to
wit, when any new thing is to be published, that concerns any change in the
Church or Commonwealth, first to acquaint the Magistrates, Rulers and
Governors with it, to approve our commission and matter unto them with all
modesty, humility, love and care of order and unity; and then with their
consents, approbation, and aid, unto the people and multitude. This is a right
course, we see, and this shall have a blessing from the Author of it, as here
it had. Then shall they obey thy voice, etc. ver. 18. id est, credent and
acquiescent tibi, vt prudentes, and qui promissiones Abrahae and patribus
factas norunt, maxim, Genesis 15. Quarta generatione reuertentur huc, etc. That
is, they shall believe thee and yield unto thee, as wisemen, and such as know
the promises made unto Abraham and the fathers, especially Genesis the 15. In the
fourth generation they shall return hither, etc. Other vainglorious,
factious, and disorderly dealings will have their confusion, and will be
strangled with the haulter of their own disobedience, even in their youth,
that is, before they come to any perfection or ripeness. For God is the Author
of Order, Government, and Rule: who appointing Elders and superiors for the
peace and quietness of his Church ever hindered with divisions and tumults,
will have them duly regarded and respected as they ought, not as far as we
lift. Think we then of it with a religious feeling, and the Lord give us
understanding in all things.

17. Then, after thus thou have acquainted the Heads of the people of Israel
with it, and they, by my working in-wardely with them, willing to obey; both
thou and they shall go to Pharaoh, the king, and say, etc. See again, and
still still most carefully note it, how God regards Government. For now
Pharaoh must be used, as was fit for his Place, (He being the king of the
land in which they were) wicked Pharaoh, I say, must not be disorderly dealt
with by such as live under his government, and within his Territories, although
strangers, and not his natural Subjects: how much less, then, by natural
Subjects? But he must be gone unto with all duty, and acquainted, with all
reverence, with their desire: that, neither themselves may be judged factious,
neither others, by their examples, moved to any disorder. They must acquaint
him with the Author of this desire, not their own heads, lusting after liberty
or nouelitie, but the Lord God, that is, that Lord which is God, and that GOD
which is Lord and Lord of Lords to work some touch, in Pharaoh, of fear.
Secondly, the Lord God of the Hebrews, that is, that has ever had care of
them, and dealt for them, as seemed good to his Wisdom. Thirdly, that their
scope was Religion, not rebellion, nor any undutiful practice against ye
state. Shall not this move us to reverence authority, when God thus notably
shows his liking of it? It is enough in this place, if God be with us.
Lastly, observe the long sufferance of God, who, though by this Pharaoh very
much offended, yet before he will smite, he will admonish, and do all things
so, as his own heart shall testify his own inexcusable wickedness. Certainly
even thus the Lord deals with our selves, if we had eyes to see it, still
forewarning, and calling to a touch, before he determine Judgment and just
destruction. His Preachers and Prophets, his rods and his crosses, his favors
and bounties be all Admonishers of us to avoid his wrath.

18. Cum Deus praenoscet contumaciam Pharaonis, cur ab initio non puniuit
illum? Cum Deus bonus and humanus sit, non vult punire ex sola praescientia,
sed expectat opperum consumatione^, and ita omnibus ostendit quam just puniat.
Alioqui etia^ long aequius est Pharaonis nequitiam patefieri, quam Deum
crudelem appellari. Nam si puniuisset antequa^ redarguisset, crudelis vtique
visus esset et iniquus. Nunc autem perspicitur Dei longanimitas, and Pharaonis
impietas atque feritas conuincitur. Theodoret. in Exodus
But I know that the King of Egypt will not let you go, but by strong hand.
Therefore will I sttetch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which
I will do in the midst thereof: and after that shall he let you go. How well
does the Lord see, what the wicked think is secret and hidden? to wit, their
thoughts and purposes, their dispositions and nature: yea, before themselves
know what they will do, he knows: and shall not this move them? Their
stubborn and stiff hearts contemning admonitions and all means of their
reformation, the Lord knows and sees before. How may this comfort the
zealous Minister, that is wearied and wasted with longing after the life of
them that wish his death, with praying, entreating, and crying upon men for
their good, that they would hearken and consider, that they would be reconciled
to God, and save their souls? I say, how may this comfort him, that this
blockishnes and hardness, this ingratitude and unkindness of theirs was known to
the Lord ever? And therefore to content himself, that he has given warning
like a faithful Watchman, that he has loved like a faithful Pastor, and
endeavored their good, as a true Minister: leaving the Lord, now, to his
further pleasure, even, to stretch out his hand, and to smite such Pharaohs
with their Land, that is, their possessions and goods, their friends and
associates, as here he did: for, till Pharaoh feel it, he will not think
of His might. The Preacher speaks in the air, the friend privately loses
his labor, and honest advise: Pharaoh feels not, but thinks himself wise,
and them, fools. Their love returns therefore into their own bosom, being
noted in Gods Book, for a Witness against them; and that sweet comfort shows
it self to be taken hold of; We are a sweet savor to the Lord in them that
perish. After this, consider with your self here again in that it is said,
Pharaoh will not let them go, but by strong hand; How far more easy it is to
come into Egypt, than to get out? So it is assuredly a smooth way to Hell, by
many pleasant delights; but, to return and give over the sin once entered
into, to forsake that pleasant way, This is a work, This is a labor, nay This
is a Grace indeed. Any man may leap into a pit at his pleasure, but he must
come out with more difficulty, if ever he come out. Therefore, in my
conceit, the good woman dealt wisely with the Friar that solicited her to
sin, and told her, he would sing and say prayers for her, that should
cleanse her from all her offense, and deliver her presently out of Purgatory,
(if she should happen to die whilst he was alive) when she appointed a pit
to be dug in the way where the Friar should come in the night, and to be
covered with some grass, that it might not appear; into which, as soon as
ever the Friar came, he fell, and not able any way to get out again. Anon,
when he had cooled himself well, the woman came also, as though she had come
to meet him, to whom the poor Friar pitifully complains, that he was
fallen into that pit, there, and could not get out; praying her to use some
means for his deliverance. But she wisely told him, he should remember what
he said unto her, to wit, that, out of the pit of Purgatory, he could sing
her or any that should offend with him: and now, there, was a good place to
try the power of his Music and Songs, that she and others might believe him
the better. If he would have his Portesse sent for, she said, she would; but
other help he should get none of her: And so she left him to sing himself
out, if he could. So slight a matter made those Hypocrites then, of fearful
sin, easily purged, and easily pardoned, were it never so wittingly and
wilfully committed. But this Figure of the hardness to get out of Egypt, when
once they were in, may show us, as I say, apparently the contrary, and give us
just and good cause to beware of sin. The devil is not such a foolish
Fowler, to let slip easily the bird he has caught. Every man's own experience
tells him, how hard it is, to leave a wonted wrying from the right way: and
God grant we may think of it.

19. Lastly, the Lord adds, that He would make Verse. 21.
them favored of the Egyptians: so that, when they departed they should not
go empty, etc. Where, to our comfort, we see, that all hearts are in the
hands of God, even as the rivers of water: and, that he turns them hither
and thither, at his pleasure. He can make them love, hate they never so much:
and they shall not be able to withstand his will. Yea, he can make them so
love, that fruits, from thence, shall flow to his people, of their love, even
as he best likes. Be they Jewels of silver, or Jewels of gold, Raiment, or
any thing needful and wished, they shall grant it and lend it, give it or
send it, with a favor, with a love, and with so willing a mind, as the party
taking, needs to wish. This shall the Lord do by a secret power of his
working grace and favor for his people to their good. This was that, which he
did for Jacob, the Father of these Israelites: when Laban angerly pursued him,
the Lord changed his heart. To Isaac and Abraham, before, the Lord gave favor
in several places: To Joseph, the like, to his own comfort, and the good of
many. And this is it, which the Psalmist affirms: The Lord gives grace and
worship, and no good thing shall he withold from them that live a godly life.
This is it, which all of us have tasted of, even, in our selves: and God make
us thankful. Thus may we profit by this Chapter.

CHAP. 4.
The general Heads of this Chapter are chiefly these. Moses his power to
work miracles. His excuses not to go into Egypt. His coming to Egypt at last.


1. BVtloe, they will not believe me, said Moses, etc. See first and foremost the
ingrafted weakness of man's nature, when any great or difficult thing is to be
taken in hand. It is ever fearing and doubting, ever quaking and shaking, ever
casting of perils, more than stand with that prompt readiness and willingness,
which ought to be in all the servants of God, when he, their Lord, once
speaks and says, Do this. Such fear, as this, was in Jonas, when he was
commanded Jonas. 1.
to Niniuie. In Jeremy, when he was caused to prophecy: Ierem. 1.
and, in many others. Secondly, observe in these words also, what a powerful
Pul-backe, even to the best minds, incredulity and crookednes in the people
is. Surely it pierces deep, and wounds fore, as you see in this place. For
even the fear of it, here, daunteth Moses, a man of Hebre. 11.
such faith, a man of such grace, as we read, before this, he had showed
himself to be. What? what will it do, when it is not feared, but found; not
suspected, but tried and tasted of every day? Let that great Prophet of the 1.
Kings. 19.
Lord tell us, whom it so wounded, that he sat him down, and desired to die,
to be out of woe, saying; It is enough, Lord, now, it is enough; take my soul,
for I am no better than my Fathers. Let Esaias, again, another famous Esaias. 53.
1.
Prophet witness, whose words showed woe, when he said and wrote: Who will
believe our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? as if he
should have said, (Alas! alas!) what comfort have we when so ungraciously our
preaching is rejected, and the comfortable tidings of Jesus Christ not
believed? Let the sighs of Jeremy and the groans of his soul, when he
cries, Ah Lord, etc, witness the like also to all Readers: but most wonderfully,
that spiritual battle that he took such a fearful fall in, as that he
said; I will not make mention of Ier. 20. 9.
him, nor speak any more in his name. O fiery dart, then, and piercing stroke
to a tender heart of flesh that means well! an untoward and froward people,
when so great a Prophet thus is shaken by it. I need to pursue this matter no
further, we see enough; yet could I remember you of other Prophets also, and
many more dear children of Mich. 7. 1.
God, faithful members and Ministers in the Lords business, whom yet crookednes
of the people has mightily agreeued, discouraged, and dismayde: yea, it caused
a sigh in our very Savior from the roots of his heart, that the Math. 11, 17.
people he spoke unto, so fitly might be resembled to children complained of
for not dancing when they were piped unto; not lamenting, when they were
mourned unto, etc. Conclude we therefore what we see here, the effect of
incredulity in the people, to be bitter to the Lords Messengers sent or to be
sent unto them for their good. But so see we it, that our selves avoid it,
and both day and night pray against it; remembering always, as dear children,
the Apostles words to the Hebrews: Obey them that have the ouer-sight of you,
and submit your selves: Heb. 13. 17.
for they watch for your Souls, as they that must give accounts, that they may
give it with joy, and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you, etc.
The like Scriptures there are many more, all which may comfort us, if we obey
them; and justly judge us unto the lake of Hell, if we contemn them. God that
bids will never be abused finally, but will repay. Jonas had rather commit
himself to the wild Sea and raging gulfes, than go to preach to a people,
that he could conceive no hope of, that they would believe, and be turned unto
God.

2. This infirmity in Moses the Lord mercifully cures, when, in justice, he
might have rejected him for it: So good and gracious is our God. He cures it
by a power given him to work Miracles so great and fearful, that, if not to
move Pharaoh to true repentance, yet abundantly to show his authority from
God to conduct that people, they should suffice. His Rod is turned to a
Serpent, and back again to his own nature. His hand put into his bosom is
become leaprous, and by and by whole again. The water is turned into blood;
and other great things wrought, when he came before Pharaoh. Thus can the
Lord, and thus will the Lord enable ever to the work that he appoints and
calls unto. A great comfort to Magistrates and Ministers, if it be well
considered.

3. Then flies he to another excuse, and says: He is not eloquent. But the
Lord also provides for that, as you see in the Text, and promises help:
Still so weak and wayward is man, and so good and gracious is God. The Jews
have a Tale amongst them, how Moses came by this infirmity of speech: And say,
that, when he was a child and brought by Pharaohs daughter before her Father
the King; the King playing with him, and offering hun his golden Crown; the
child took it, and threw it under his feet: wherewith the King being
offended, and some lookers on judging it Fatal (as if that child should
overthrow the King,) the Nurse, to show the childs want of wit, put an hot
coal to his mouth, which he straight licked with his tongue, and so hurt his
speech. But the Scripture tells us not any cause, and therefore ignorance is
best. Cum omniune Dom. Mosis ministerio vti velit, cur tardiorie linguae fecit
illis etc? Quia hoc Potentiam Diuinam magis illustrabat. Que^admodum enim
Piscatores, Publicanos, and Cerdones veritatis praedicatores and Doctores
pietatis creauit: sic per vocem infirmam and linguam tardam confudit (...)
sapientes Egypti. Theodoret in locum.
This rightly we may note, that God chooses men in man's eyes not so fit, that
his glory may more appear: and therefore take we heed, how we censure our
Calling for some defects, since God could have made Moses eloquent, and did
not. In our own Stories, how M. Tyndall complained for want of utterance, we
see: and yet, what a notable member and Martyr in Gods Church was he?

4. Lastly, when these excuses serve not, Moses breaks out even to an height
of weakness, and prays him to send some other. A strange thing, that a man so
full of Gods Spirit, after such comforts, should yet be so backward. But this
is, again, I say, the mighty discomfort of incredulity, and want of the taste
of good things: when a man, before he goes to do his message, cannot
conceive, that his service shall prevail. And, I would all Gods people might
mark it with feeling: for then should they see, how Preachers hearts consume to
dust within them, by grief conceived of backwardnes, waywardnes, and
incredulity of their hearers, to whom God has sent them. O! it biteth and
wringeth day and night, it lies gnawing and grinding the whole inwards, when
others comfortably feed upon joy and mirth. It makes a great Prophet
fearfully to pass the bounds of patience, and forget himself. For, Cursed be
the day wherein I was borne, (says that worthy Jeremiah) and let not the day,
wherein Ier. 20. 14.
my mother bare me, be blessed. Cursed be the man that showed my Father,
saying, A man-child is borne unto 15.
thee, and comforted him. And let that man be as the Cities, 16.
which the Lord has ouer-turned and repented not: and let him hear the cry
in the morning, and the shouting at noone-tide, Because he has not slain me,
even from the womb, or that my mother might have been my 17.
grave, or her womb a perpetual conception. How is it, that I came out of the
womb to see labor and sorrow, 18.
that my days should be consumed with shame? And shall this be good for such
people as cause it, think you? No, no, says the Lord: But, Obey them that
have the ouer-sight of your souls, as they that must give accounts; that they
Heb. 13. 17.
may give it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you.
Unprofitable for you, I say again, and mark it. Now, then, mourns the
Preacher; but the day comes when such Hearers shall mourn, yea rore and cry
in the wound of their consciences for such Discomforts given to Gods Messengers
sent unto them. O what are we, in this age, to Moses, the great Servant of the
Lord? And yet he, for fear of this, is so out of heart, that he prays God
plainly, to send some other. We fear it not, but feel it, find it, and see
it; and have not the Spirit in such measure, as Moses had. Alas! how can it be,
but, sometimes, our weakness should appear?

5. Do we then justify Moses in this? No, the Lord does not justify him,
and therefore we cannot. For, Then the Lord was very angry with Moses, says
the Text: not verse, 14.
angry only, but very angry. So that we see most apparently here, that there
must be a measure, at least, in our passions and tenderness; or else God is
provoked to great anger. If the Lord appoint us, we must go: if we fear, or
find discomfort we must bear, and continue still obedient to God in our
service, who will give an issue to his pleasure. And in the mean time, to our
unspeakable comfort, has said: That we are a sweet savor to him in them
that perish. Yet the Lord casts not a way his servant, for all this: but
tells him again that Aaron shall be his ver. 16.
Spokesma^ to the people etc. Setting ye authority in Moses, and making Aaron,
as it were, his Interpreter. Not unlike ye example of Flauianus in the History
of Theodoret. Moreover, Lib. 4. cap. 25. ver. 17.
says he, Thou shall take this rod in thine hand, and do miracles, Where we
may not dream of any virtue inthe rod, but cast both eyes and heart upon God;
who is able to make his Servant with a poor Rod, to match a kings glorious
Scepter.

6. Then Moses yields to Gods commandment, and returning to Iethro his
father-in-law, prays him to let ver. 18.
him go, etc. Yielding us therein these Observations. First, that he will
give no offense to Iethro, by departing otherwise than was fit: Servants and
Subjects may profit by it. Secondly, he concealeth, as it seems, the matter
from him; lest to a man not so fully yet tasting Heavenly things, it might
seem unlikely, and so he be assalted with new Pulbacks. Thirdly, he
delayeth not, but speedily addresseth himself to his business. And lastly,
though outwardly he appear but the same man, yet inwardly he has thoughts
concerning Gods glory, which is a very Pattern for all good hearers of Gods
word.

7. Iethro hinders not; though, no doubt, it was to his great grief
(according to nature) to part with him and with his Daughter, and their
Children. So is it every one of our duties to yield unto the will and working
of God in all things. For his we are, and for his glory and service we have
been created: where, when, how, and how long, they are circumstances known
and directed by him ever to the best, if we believe and obey. Moses takes the
Rod of God in his hand, says ye Text, his Wife and his ver. 20.
Sons upon an Ass, and away he goes.. Husbands, see the heart of a good
man, to have his wife and children with him: Wives and Children, see a duty
due, to be followers willingly of their Husbands or Fathers calling, even into
any country. And when I look at his Rod, me think I see lively little
David, marching cheerfully with his staff and scrip against huge Goliath. Good
Lord! what weapons were those against him, then, in man's eyes, or this staff,
now, in Moses hand, against mighty Pharaoh of Egypt? But God is the same, both
here, and then, and Sed Deus est idem, qui fuit ante, mihi
for ever; strong in weakness, and able, as I said before, to match a Kings
Scepter with a stick, or a staff, or a stone, or a word, in the hand or mouth
of one sent and appointed by him unto his Glory. Blessed be his Majesty for
evermore for his goodness: Amen. And, dear Lord, give faith to depend upon
thee in all comfort, whenever thou call to any duty, not looking to our
selves, or second means; but above al, and over all, at thy mighty Power,
that shall ever give testimony, as in these examples, of thy stretched-out arm
in the midst of weakness and contemptible show, to effect thy Will. Blessed is
that man, says ye kingly Prophet, David, Whose strength is the Lord, and in
whose heart are thy ways. I will love thee dearly, O Lord, my strength. For
thou art my Rock and my fortress, and he that delivers me, my God and my
might, my shield and my buckler, the horn of my salvation and my refuge,
Psalm. 18 1. 2.
in thee will I trust. etc. Go we, then, forth, if the Lord so call, against
the States of this earth, armed but in show, as Moses was, or little David:
and we shall taste the strength of the Lord, to his glory and our comfort, as
they did.

8. And the Lord said unto Moses, when thou art entered and come into Egypt
again, see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in
thy hand: but I will harden his heart, and he shall not let the people go.
This was done that the Tyrant might see by these mighty works, how he had
not to do with man, but with God, and so be void and naked of all excuse. But
This, that the Lord says, He will harden his heart, troubles some: and they
seek to temper it according to their fancies, lest it should seem injustice
in the Lord; first, to harden, and then destroy: not remembering what the
Apostle says. God will have mercy, on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
will, he hardneth. And, if any object Exodus 33. 19. Romans 9. 18.
and say; why does he, then, complain? for who has resisted his Will? His
mouth is stopped by the same Apostle, in the same place, with this. O man, who
art thou, that pleadest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that
formed it, why have thou made me thus? Noting, that no reason is to be
demanded above Gods Will: for who will go further, shall taste the reward of
his rashness, and the Majesty of God shall ouer-whelme him. Has not the Potter
power over the clay, to make of the same lump, one vessel to honor, and
another to dishonor? And shall less authority be given to God? Ask the
Potter a reason, and it is but, his Will; and yet dust and ashes will demand
more of God. Again, if we be all of one Lump of corruption, (as we must
needs confess we are) if it please God to exempt some from the death due to
so sinful wretches, does he any wrong to others that he vouchsafes not the
same unto, leaving them but to their own natures? No, he may do with his own
as it pleases him, and what he does, still is just, holy and good. Let the
wicked, then, accuse themselves, and not God: for still in themselves they shall
find the cause, if rightly they look into their own will.

9 It follows in the Text: Then thou shall say to Pharaoh, thus says the
Lord; Israel is my Son, even my first borne. Wherefore, I say to thee, let my
Son go, that he may serve me: if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will
slay thy Son, even, thy first borne. Mark then How God calls his church.
the Title God gives to his Church, and meditate on it earnestly. He calls
it, his Son, yea, his first borne noting therein, to all flesh, that it is to
him as a man-child to the Father, yea, as the first borne, which, commonly, is
loved most tenderly, and in greatest honor. Now then, think with your self,
what heart is in you to the fruit of your body, and to your first borne:
think, how you could endure to stand and look upon the abuse offered by any
to the whole or any part; as, to see but a leg or an arm cut off
injuriously by bloody butchers; and then, think of God to his Church, and
every part of it: whose affection so-much excels yours, as God excels
man; and holiness and perfection, misery, sin and corruption. What a comfort
is this, when the Devil roareth, and Tyrants (his instruments) rage,
breathing-out blood at their nostrils, and nothing but death and destruction at
their mouths, with furious phrases and speeches of pride, as though there were
none that could stop them, or control them in what they will. Think on the
difference of GOD and man in this point; that many harms may be done to our
Sons and our first borne, which we see not, neither know of, and therefore at
the instant feel not any touch for it or by it: But God sees ever and every
where all actions, all intendments and purposes, all thoughts and secret
attempts whatsoever, and still is above man in his tenderness of love to his
sons and children, as far as God excels dust and earth and sin and
corruption, as I said. O, what a touch give these raging cruelties, then,
against his Church unto him? what a feeling has he of them, and how do they
pierce his gracious bowels, wherein he has wrapped-vp his people as his Sons
and as his first borne? Still think of your self, what heart would be in you,
and then try the difference of God and you. But, you will say unto me, it is
comfortable to consider this tender love that you note indeed: but why then
does God suffer such injuries and oppressions, being able to auert them, as
man is not, for the most part. This is the love of a Father, that he neither
can see nor suffer to be done to the child he loves any outrage and
cruelty, his power being able to save his child from it. To which if I
answer, I must pray you to continue even still in your own resemblance, and
to tell me if you daily see not most tender Fathers perceiving cause for a
further good, to suffer their children to lie in prison, to be tossed in law,
to be schooled many ways by suffering want and biting upon ye bridle for a
time; and yet in ye midst of al these things have an eye to them, a love to
them and asetled purpose, (when they know themselves and their strength, the
world and his practices, men and their humors, and many such things, not
otherwise of many well learned, often, but by these means,) then to
set-hand-to and to help them; that then a love may be known a love, and a
good a good, with a lively taste, in comparison of that which would have been,
if sooner the Father or friend had stepped in. So, so is it with the Lord for
our capacity, (though indeed no comparison betwixt Him and us.) He knows
his times and turns and our wants perfectly, fitting the one to the other
most mercifully, that both onr corruption and his goodness may best appear to
the greatest benefit unto us. Therefore let him alone in his own ways, and
tarry we, as the Psalm. says, his blessed leisure, Be strong, and he shall
comfort our Psalm. 27. 14*
hearts, and put we our trust ever in him. Of the earthly father or friend the
Proverb says; well he may see his child or kinsman need, but he cannot
endure to see him bleed. So our sweet God, well he may see us humbled, and
schooled and tamed and wained from the love of this wretched world, but undone
and cast away finally and for ever, he cannot endure it, he will not suffer it,
he will not see it. O, blessed be his Name for ever and ever for it. Have this
in your remembrance therefore as a sweet Comfort, the occasion of this Note.
Israel is my Son, even my first borne. And therefore, tell Pharaoh, ver. 22. 23.
he were best take heed what he does; for I will make his Son and first
borne feel it, if he hinder mine, and will not let them go to serve me. The
world you know contemns and despises us, counting us ye refuse of the
people, and what may be base or vile: but this love is life, and this regard
with God, is honor most high: in the comfort whereof, we may sup-vp these
earthly scorns, if his Grace be with us. The Prophet Esaias, in his spirit
tasted this, when so sweetly he prophesied and published (to this day to be
seen and heard) Thus says the Esaias. 43. 1.
Lord that cretaed thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not:
for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When
thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the floudes,
that thy do not ouerflow thee: when thou walk through the fire, thou shall
not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy
God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior: I gave Egypt for thy ransom,
Ethiopia and Seba for thee, etc. read the Chap. your self, and I stay here.

10. Now see an Accident in the way. When Moses verse. 24.
was in his Inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him. That is, by
either a sore sickness, or some other way, the Lord made him know his wrath
conceined against him; as also the cause, to wit, the omitting of the
circumsicion of his Son, as by the event we may see; although it be not
expressly named. Where, to our profit, let us stay a while, and consider diverse
things. First, why Moses, so well acquainted with the law of God in this
behalf, should omit or neglect to do it. And, for answer hereunto, mark with
your self, how, of two sons which Moses had, and carried with him, the
circumcision of one is only here mentioned: whereby you may well see, the
other was before, and already circumcised, or else Gods wrath would not have
stayed in this place, upon performance of duty only to one. Now, the one
having before been circumcised, why should he not have done the like to the
other, but that (out of all question,) his wife, being not sonndly persuaded
in this point, took offense at the first, grew unquiet, offered unfit
speathes, and happily stirred up her father also, Iethro, to join with her to
rattle Moses for such cruelty (as they esteemed it) to his son. Whereupon,
the good man, mild and soft of spirit, in humane frailety chose rather to
forbear the second son to have his peace, than to circumcise also him, and
please God. A notable example to teach us this doctrine; how needful it is
even to the great Doctors and Divines, to the great Masters and Teachers, and
rulers and leaders of others, still and continualy to be underpropped and
held-vp by Gods powrefull aid and blessed Spirit, in their duties: when as,
otherwise, even they, they, I say, that seem so strong, play Moses part here,
and faint in the way, to the offense of God, and danger of themselves. Nay, if
Moses faint, how much more fall they flat down, that never had such measure of
grace, as Moses had? Pray therefore, and pray continually for increase of
strength, for courage and fortitude, for constancy and power, to repel all the
darts, that Satan shall throw at us: and prepare we to buckle with men and
women and Devils that shall assay to quench or to cool our zeal in our places,
and to bring us to omit this, and that, and every day somewhat which God
expressly requires, and will not abide to be omitted. See, you Discouragers and
discomforters of Gods servants, in necessary duties, what venom is in your
darts, and poison in yonr doings. Moses (this great man) is overcome and
brought into danger by them; and, O, how shall athousand others of far weaker
strength be turned out of the way, by you? Will God be angry with Moses for
yielding? and shall you safely escape, that are the causes of his sin, the
cut-throates of his zeal, and the ouer-turners of his well doing? No, no,
assure your selves the wrath of the Lord shall consume you, when it has
profitably corrected his child, unless you repent and leaue-off such
Deuillish dealing. See you also, you brawling and unquiet women, what your
ignorance and obstinacy brings your husbands unto, though they be (as Moses)
holy and virtuous? they cannot serve God a-right for you, they cannot do what
God requires but you break their hearts, you cool their zeal, you turn
them out of the way, and in the end you bring them to a fearful danger of
Gods destroying of them. For the Lord met Moses here, and would have killed
him, says the Text. Shall this ever be unpunished verse. 24.
in you? no; your Husbands shall be schooled for their frailty, and you shall
be consumed for your arrogancy, so proudly and so disobediently contemning
both their religious instructions, and holy actions. If God be in you, this
will be a warning.

11. Then Zipporah took a sharp knife, and cut away the foreskin of her
Son. The two things that here might verse. 25.
be considered, (namely, that doctrine of Popery concerning the danger of
children dying unbaptized, and secondly of such an absolute necessity of
Baptism, as that women must administer it in time of supposed need) I
forbear to stand upon now: I have sufficiently touched them in my Notes upon
Genesis. Therefore do but remember with your self (touching the first) that
we make a great difference betwixt want of the Sacrament, and contempt of the
same; contempt, damning; and want, not, through the strength of Gods promise;
meaning, by want, when God so preuenteth by death, that it cannot be had,
according to the manner allowed in the word. And, touching the second, observe,
that this act of Zipporah, here, in circumcising her child, was merely
extraordinary, and does no way warrant women to baptize now-a-daies. Her
bitter words to her husband (that he was a bloody husband to her) show but
what speeches are often given by women that have their tongues a little too
much at liberty. His wisdom, in not answering her, is to this day his praise;
and her fact, her fault, in so undutifully speaking. Let this suffice of this
Chapter: and now read the Text over in your Bible, and see how these Notes
have helped you. My drift you see, and I leave it to God. I would have all men
encouraged to read.

CHAP. 5.
The chief Heads of this Chapter are these. The coming of Moses and Aaron to
the King. The greeuanees of the people. Their impatiencie.


1. TOuching the first, here we see, that, although Moses was very backward
awhile to obey God and go to this King upon this errand; yet at last he
yielded: faith overcame fear, and all conceits steeped to the obedience of
God. A happy thing! and happy is that man and woman ever, which can likewise
say truly; I have had my fears and fancies, my errors and mine ignorances, my
pride and my prejudice against that which was good and right; but they are all
gone (I thank God,) and I much joy that they are gone, as likewise that I am
now sincerely his whose I ought to be, and in this obedience do not doubt but
shall end my days, by his grace.

2. We may again think here, why God should thus send Moses and Aaron to
pray deliverance for his people, when he was able without stretched arm to
have delivered them at his pleasure? And we may answer our selves in this
sort, even for the reasons following, and such like. First, that these sundry
bickerings with this Tyrant for his Church might notably show his love and
affection to his Church, which is every man's great and special comfort.
Secondly, that patience might be taught by this Example to all Gods children,
if their troubles and oppressions receive not an end by and by. Thirdly, he
thus takes all excuse from this obstinate enemy; (a thing of good use, if we
observe it.) For even as here by Moses and Aaron the Lord dealt which Pharaoh;
so by his Ministers still the Lord deals with us: leaving us as naked without
excuse, if we continue disobedient, as ever he did Pharaoh. Fourthly, he
thus discovered the great darkness of our understanding until it be lightened,
and the damnable waywardnes of our will, till it be changed by him. Fifthly and
lastly, by this manifesting of the enemies malice, he opens (to our
unspeakable comfort, and so of his Church unto the end) what a victorious hand
he has to save and deliver when and whom he shall ever please, be the rage
never so strong and great. For Pharaoh cannot hold out, but whilst God will,
we see here; no more shall any Tyrant to the worlds end. Thus you see, why God
used this way, by message and entreatie, rather than the other, by his power
and might. Let it profit you, and so I leave it.

3. You see also here again, how God calls them his people, although
oppressed and in misery under a wicked, wayward, and profane Governor. It is
a sweet comfort to those that taste of like grief; and shows, as I have
noted before, that affliction seperateth not from God: but in the midst of all
woe, he regards, and says, mine, mine; although instantly he rebuke not
either wind or weather, etc.

4. Pharaoh, his proud answer, saying, Who is the Lord, that I should hear
him? pictureth out the hardness of an unregenerate heart, and bids all
beholders to pray against it. O dust and ashes, dare thou say thou know
not him that made thee, and not tremble for thy ignorance? This vnfeelingnes
was in Pilate, when he said: what is truth? And what is that which some
amongst us utter every day, what new doctrine is this? Sed non impune recusat
Pharaoh quod scienter ignorant. But, to his woe does Pharaoh refuse what
wittingly and willingly he knows not. And so shall all that delight in
ignorance. Hence comes waywardnes and wilfulnes, obstinacy and frowardnes,
rage and madness, that men will not hear and know. But in Pharaoh see what will
follow one day, when by voice and words no good is done. He in the Sea, thou
in the lake that ever burns shall perish and sink to eternal confusion.

5. I will not let them go, says he. Then, his reason is, his Will; ever the
refuge of the Reprobate. I will not; I will not; and still in the end, I will
not. A short resolution, but as dangerous a resolution as man can make against
his own soul, many times. In the 6. of Jeremy, see the like answer. We
will not walk therein. Again, in the 44. Chap. The word that thou have spoken
to us, in the name of the Lord, we will not hear it of thee, etc. And many
more like answers there be in the Scriptures; but whose be they? even such, I
say, as rebel against God and his good motives made to them by his Ministers
and means wishing them well. Wherefore the end is Gods wrath upon them, and
fearful destruction. Such answers we hear too often amongst our selves,
saying; I am settled, etc. and I will not hear you. God grant in any due time
we may learn by other men's harms, and leave them. For true and true shall
we find that S. Augustine says, Religio stulta non prodest, sed obest. A
foolish Religion does not profit, but hurt: and God is just to all men in his
time, I mean, in punishing their proud disobedience. This is confirmed even
in that which follows in the next verse in these words: Lest he bring upon
us the pestilence or sword. Noting, that this is ever the end of the contempt
of divine worship, according to the prescript of God, some fearful plague and
judgment. Surely, this one place would suffice to many to awake them, and
shall no places profit us? Were this people of Israel in danger, and we in
none? have we the Lord bound, that we may do what we list, and yet be safe?
If they go not out to sacrifice to the Lord, that is, to serve and worship him
in that sort and manner that then he commanded, the Lord will bring upon them
the pestilence or sword; and if we stiflie and stubbornly, proudly and
presumptuouslie refuse to go out but of our doors to the Church by us to
serve him as now he commands, shall nothing follow? God touch us, and move
us; the knife is upon our throats, and we fear not. Whole houses and Manors
are rooted out and ruinated, not only abroad in the Land, but even in the
Country (peradventure where we dwell) for this rebellion; and yet we think
our posterity shall abide and nothing happen upon our heapings for them, when
he is despised that does but blow upon lands and livings and they are gone.
Cathedram in Coelo habet, qui corda mouet. His chair is in Heaven, that moves
hearts: and he, for his mercy sake, I say again, move us, that we may
enquire, seek and see whether we do well, or wrong, and do as we ought,
when we see it. The Lord has promised to take away the stony heart and to
give a fleshie in the place, if we will urge him with his promise by humble,
hearty and earnest prayer. So did David, when he cried; O, let me feel, let
me feel, knowing even then, that this Gods mercy, if it were Psalm. 51.
sought, should be granted.

6. Then said the King of Egypt unto them, Moses and verse. 4.
Aaron, why cause ye the people to cease from their works, etc? See the lot
of the Just; to be quarrelled with, nipped, quipped, slaundred, and even laden
many times with false and most injurious imputations. To Prophets, Apostles,
Incurious imputations.
Martyrs, and Jesus Christ himself, this measure has been measured, and they
have borne it. Deus videt, the Lord sees, and in his due time he will make
the truth appear. Fero, spero; I endure, and hope; let it be thy Meditation
when none sees but he that sees in secret. Again, mark here, how, when
God draws near to yield us comfort, then Satan in his members rages more,
and seeks to increase our troubles, sorrows and griefs: but yet all in
vain, God in the end will deliver his Servants in despite of all their
enemies, as here he did. Be of good comfort, and lay it up in thy heart.

7. They be idle, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go Ver. 8.
to offer sacrifice, etc. A truth it is, that nothing is worse than Idleness,
the mother of all vice; as, discord, slander, and slaughter, and such like:
but that here they were idle, was an error in the King, and a malicious lie in
those that so informed him. By which we may learn and see, how wicked men
have no eyes, often, to see the true causes of a thing, but most apt and ready
to devise a false. Let a man or woman be grieved extraordinarily with the
burden of their sins, and with groans and sighs travail under the
bitterness of it, leaving thereupon those recreations which erst they used, and
delighted in, what say the wicked? oh, it is a melancholy, and the body would
be purged, etc. But, oh, they are blind and have no eyesight into the
combats of the godly, may we truly say, and so leave them. Festus imagines
Paul is mad, when he speaks the words Act. 26. 24.
of truth and sobernes: and that much learning makes him mad, when learning is
wisdom, and makes wise. Yea, Heli himself mistaketh Anna, a virtuous woman,
1. Sam. 2.
and deemeth her to be drunk; when ravished in her holy feeling, she was
crying to GGD with fervent prayer. Wherefore, the Apostle teaches, To the end
Christ might Heb. 2. 17.
be merciful, and a faithful high Priest in things concerning God, it
behooued him in all things to be made like unto his brethren. And, in another
place, We have not an Chap. 4. 14
high Priest, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but
was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without sin, etc.

8. And let them not regard vain words, says Pharaoh. Ver. 9.
Such taste and such conceit have vain persons, of Gods word. In the 14. of
the Acts, the truth of God, you know, is called, Heresy, of the wicked: And,
in the 17. Chapter it is called, New, of vain Philosophers that knew not
what it was. Examples of use, to give us contentment in patience, when like
ignorance in our days brings forth like blasphemies. Be stayed and strong.

9. Then went the Taske-maisters of the people, and verse, 10.
their Officers out, and told the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will
give you no more straw. Go your selves, 11.
get you straw where ye can find it, yet shall nothing of your labor be
diminished. Then were the people scattered, 12.
etc. See again what was said before, how the nearer that God draws to his
Church and Children to do them good, the more rages Satan, in and by his
members, against them. Hard, hard therefore are the beginnings of deliverance
out of Egypt, spiritual Egypt I mean, as well as out of this earthly Egypt.
And therefore, when the Lord shall touch thy hand, and open thine eyes to see
where thou art, how far out of the way that leads to eternal life, and
give thee a desire to return and be saved, Remember what the wiseman says,
and be comforted with it. My Son, if thou will come into the service of GOD,
stand fast in righteousness and fear, and prepare Ezcles. 2. 1.
thy soul to temptation, etc. Read the place to the end. Remember that
Example in the Gospel, how the foul Mark. 9. 26.
spirit being commanded to depart, rent and tare the party more and worse
than ever before. We cannot leave any sin wherein we have continued, but
by and by some contrary wind will blow, and we shall be discouraged, if it
may be, sometimes with threatenings and bitter words, sometimes with show of
perils and losses that may ensue, sometimes with mocks and taunts in very
spightfull manner; and in a word, if we have done evil, we must do evil
still, and so be cast away, or else Satan will want his will: But be
strengthened with this Example and others in the Word. Here, now, their burden
and misery is greater than ever before. For, now, they must have no more
straw, but gather it where they can; and yet make up the tale and number of
their brick before: which was a great extremity, yet the end is still as the
Lord has decreed: his purpose is to deliver them from this slavery: and, when
his time comes, they shall be delivered, and let go, whosoever says, nay.
Though discomfort increase for a little while, to draw sighs out of the
heart, to him that can help; yet, it shall end with joyful comfort put in the
place of it, and so much the sooner, by how much it grows the sharper. O,
stand then, and shrink not; and say in your heart, now, now is my God at hand.
For now I feel and see the enemy maddest to oppress me, if he could. Come,
therefore, sweet Lord, I humbly beseech thee; stay not; and, till thou
come, vouchsafe thy hand to stay me, that I faint not. Thou art strong, and
I am weak; thou art good, and I am bad; but thou art mine, and I am thine. O
Blessed, Blessed, support thine own, that I may ever praise thee.

10. And the Taske-masters hasted them, saying; Finish verse. 13. 14. 15.
your dayes-worke, etc. And they beat them. Then they cried to Pharaoh, etc. A
Story to show you, if you note it, how the Law works without the Gospel;
even roughly, and sharply, and rigorously. For, do this, do this; and
finish finish the work, is still the voice of it. Whereby sin and the Devil
rages as here Pharaoh does. For, sin, says Romans 7. 8. 9. 10
the Apostle, took occasion by the law, etc. So, sin revived, But I died:
and the same commandment, which was ordained unto life, was found to be unto
me unto death, etc. Then cries the true Israelite, O wretched 24.
man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? as here they
cried unto Pharaoh, to be delivered from their misery. Blessed therefore be
the Lord for his sweet Gospel, which helps all this rigor, and gives us
comfort and deliverance in his Son, from this great rage to our endless
comfort. See also, how Tyranny once begun, increases more and more from
words to blows: verse. 14. And, when they cry unto Pharaoh, in hope of
remedy, verse, 15. showing him the iniquity of their usage; and, how their
offense, in not making up their tale of brick, grew by other men's faults, that
gave them no straw, verse, 16: this pitiful complaint which should Ver. 16
have moved him to commiseration, works but a confirmation of tyranny in the
wicked King: first, mocking and scoffing at their Religion, (as wicked men use
to do) verse, 17, and uttering his cruelty with his own mouth, There Ver. 17
Ver. 18.
shall no straw be given you, yet shall you deliver the whole tale of Brick,
ver. 18. Wherefore, how happy Kingdoms be, to which the Lord has granted
merciful and gracious Princes, full of pity and clemency, flowing from a
true taste of holy Religion, and from an immovable love of their true
Subjects, I leave the Reader, if he have any bowels in him, to feel, and
consider; sending up his thanks where it is due, for what he enjoys in
abundant measure.

11. Then the Officers of the Children of Israel saw themselves Ver. 19. Ver.
20.
in an evil case, etc. And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in their way
as they came out from Pharaoh. To whom they said, the Lord look upon you, and
judge, Ver. 21.
for ye have made our savor to stink before Pharaoh, and before his Servants,
in that ye have put a sword in their hands to sley us. A third event of the
embassage of Moses and Aaron is, this bitter expostulation of these Officers:
wherein, as in a glass most bright and clear, you see the condition and lot
of faithful Ministers in this wretched world. First, the King, and now the
people accuse them as worthy of great reproof (both grievous to good minds:)
but especially, to be accused of their brethren, when they do as their duty
requires, O, it is double grievous, and ever was. But thus was it ever, and
will be ever: and therefore, praemonitus praemunitus, forewarned forearmed,
and, praeuisaiacula minus feriunt; Darts espied before they come hurt less.
God give us patience and love still to them that love not us. Here, is great
bitterness (and yet undeserved) in this their speech, if you mark it; and here
is great inconstancy, compared with the Chapter before, where they worshipped,
and welcomed these happy Messengers of a gracious God, who saw their
oppression and misery, and sent to help them. But, quae nocent docent, Schola
crucis schola lucis.
things hurtful instruct and give wisdom. While all is well, good is the
Minister; and when the cross comes, he and his doctrine (though the truth of
God is cause of all) away with that, and away with him. The word which thou
have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will Ier. 44. 16, etc.
not hear it of thee. But we will do whatsoever thing goes out of our own
mouth, as to burn Incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink
offerings unto her, as we have done, both we and our Fathers, our Kings, and
our Princes in the Cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: (now mark
their reason) for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and felt no
evil. But, since we left off to burn Incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to
pour out drink offerings unto her, we have had scarcenes of all things, and
have been consumed by the sword, and by famine. This is the stay of the
multitude, and this is the line they measure all things by, their prosperity
in worldly matters, and immunitie from trouble and affliction any ways. But it
is a crooked rule, if we hearken to God, and he that will follow him, must
take up his cross and follow him, when his good pleasure shall be so. Take
heed also by these men's examples, to expect deliverance from any calamity
sooner and faster than God pleases. For, because of this, they break out in
this sort against Gods Servants: they will not tarry the leisure of God, but
when themselves will, and as they will, they must be delivered. A dangerous
dealing, and no way fit for them that are seekers and crauers.

12. Wherefore Moses returned to the Lord, and said, ver. 22.
Lord, why have thou afflicted this people? wherefore have thou thus sent me?
For, since I came to Pharaoh to speak 23.
in thy Name, he has vexed this people, and yet thou have not delivered thy
people. See, see the right remedy in all affliction, even to return unto the
Lord, as Moses did here. For, he wounds and he heals, he kills and he
makes 1. Sam. 2. 6.
alive, he brings down to the grave and raises up again. But, Moses manner
of returning with such expostulations, here, is not to be commended: for he
pleads with the Lord, as though he did contrary to his promise, because as
yet there appeared no fruit of his embassage. He also complains, as though
his calling were in vain, since worse and worse was the condition of the
people from his first coming. Wherefore see and mark the weakness of the
strongest sometimes, and especially when of such they are vexed as they have
deserved well, and indeed should receive a kinder course from them. O gall of
friends, how bitter art thou? how strikest thou to the very bottom of a
fleshie heart, and leauest a sting behind thee, that kills with the poison
and venom of it, if God succor not? Neither the fury of Pharaoh, nor the
cruelty of the Egyptians moved Moses any thing: but, his own to wrong him,
whose good he sought, and with all peril to himself endeavored, it moves
him so, that his weakness breaks out even before his God. This should move
men, and all that look to be liked and live with God, to forbear and fly
from the like unkindness toward those whom God has sent to them for their good:
and this must remember such messengers to pray for strength; and as Moses yet
forsook not his Office for all this, so neither they to do; but still going
on, to expect the Lords mercy which here to Moses now showed it self, and gave
him comfort, as follows in the next Chapter.

CHAP. 6.
The parts of this Chapter are two. First, a repetition of things done before,
from the 1. verse to the 12. Secondly, a short Story, by way of digression, of
the names and families of the Israelites, from the 12. verse to the end of the
Chapter.


1. TThen, for use of this Chapter, let us consider these words of the Lord,
ver. 3: And I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by the ver. 3.
Name of Almighty God: but by my Name Jehovah was I not known unto them: and
understand the true sense and meaning of them. Wherein we may not think that
this name Jehovah was unknown before this time, (for expreslie he named
himself thus to Abraham, Genesis 15. 7. and to Jacob, Genesis 28. 13. as also in the
26. ver. 24. where Jacob prayed unto the Lord by this Name:) But the Lords
meaning is, by this kind of speech to prefer, by way of comparison, this
manifestation of himself which now he intended to make, before all others made
to the Fathers in former times, because those contained but promises, this
should have the effect and performance of the promises: so as the words are, as
if the Lord should have said; I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by the
name of Almighty God: that is, I gave them promises which they by faith laid
hold on and believed, moved with the assurance they had of my Almighty power
and all-sufficiencie: but by my name Jehovah, Iehoua, qui est, et esse facit
quod promisit.
was I not known unto them: that is, I gave them not the accomplishment and
matter of my promise, as now at this time I will do to you. For now as my Name
Jehovah signifies an existence by my self, of who^, in whom, by whom, and for
whom, whatsoever is, is, and has being: so shall you see it come to pass in
your Deliverance from this raging Tyrant, and cruel bondage. I will perform
what I have said, and I will now cause it to be, what heretofore I have only
said should be. S. Bernard has a good Saying touching this matter, when he
teaches us thus; That the calling of God by several Names, as Father,
Master, or (as here) Almighty, Jehovah, and the like, arises not of any
variety in his Nature, which ever was, and shall be inuariable; but of and
from a manifold variety of affections in us, according to a diverse profiting,
or not profiting of our souls, whereby he seems to be changed with us that
change. So may I profit in the way of Godliness, that his Name toward me may be
a Father; and so may I not profit, as his Name may be a Judge, a Revenger
mighty and terrible, etc.

2. Let us observe these words, ver. 5. I have heard the groaning of the
children of Israel, whom the Egyptians verse. 5.
keep in bondage, etc. Are they not sweet and comfortable? Miserable man
remembers and hears his friends when they are in prosperity, and if
adversity come unto them, neither hearing nor seeing then, but a proud,
scornful, and bitter forgetting. The Lord is not so; but when we are at the
worst, then he remembers us, then he hears our groans and sighs, and
pitying helps, to our unspeakable comfort. O kind, O gracious and dear
God, still continue this ear of mercy toward thy poor afflicted Servants,
and give that deliverance, ease, and freedom, that ever, ever may be matter
of thy praise to all succeeding learners, how sweet thy nature is. Amen. Amen.

3 Also, I will take you for my people, etc. Behold the ver. 7.
end of all deliverance, and of all benefits received from God, even that we
should be his people, that he might rule in us and over us, and his praise be
ever in our mouths. Wherefore see how careful we should be always to
answer this our Calling, and never to be found unmindful of such favors.
For, if this plainer manifestation of his goodness to them, more than to their
fathers, was matter to them justly to stir them up to thankful feeling; how
much more should his manifestation of himself to us in his own Son, in whom
he has opened all the treasures of mercy and loving kindness, move us to an
eternal and never ceasing care to please him, serve him, honor him, and love
him? And then more perticularly, that he should accept me, me, for one of his
people, O, what can I say for such a love, but beseech him ever to make me
thankful? Amen, Amen.

4. And I will bring you into the Land which I swear verse. 8.
that I would give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it unto
you for a possession: I am the Lord. Sweet and comfortable was this promise,
as often as God repeated it: but many were the difficulties that appeared to
men's eyes against this hope, all which how great so-euer or many, the Lord if
you mark it, eases with this one word, Ego Dominus, I am the Lord. Thereby
teaching, that as long as our hearts hold this persuasion of him, that he is
the Lord; so long we must ever rest assured without fearful fainting, that
he can perform his promises in mercy made unto us, be there never such stops
and lets in our eyes. What then is thy case? are thy sins many, and great?
remember he is the Lord, and play not Cains part, to say, they cannot be
forgiven. Are thine enemies strong and fierce, and bitterly bent against thee?
He is the Lord, and therefore can stop and stay them, they shall not hurt thee
above his pleasure, which shall be no hurt, but profit to thee in the end. Are
thine infirmities many? he can heal them; he is the Lord. Are thy children
untoward, or unkind? he can change them; he is the Lord. Finally, whatsoever
greeueth thee, remember this, and be comforted; he is the Lord, he shall ever
be the Lord, and he shall ever be thy Lord to care for thy woes, and to send
thee help. Only believe.

5. So Moses told the Children of Israel thus, but they hearkened not unto
him. See, see how hard it is, as your verse. 9.
Marginall Note says to show true obedience under the Cross. Neither the
word of God, nor his miracles, wherewith heretofore they justly have been
moved, and wondered, have now any place with them; but all dulled and deaded
with conceived griefs, they suffer themselves to be carried away beyond the
measure that Gods children should ever hold in their adversity; which, as it
is a very dangerous thing, so ought it carefully to be avoided. It is often a
penalty that he lays upon the contemners of his Graces, that cleaving
altogether to the external favors and fawnings of this life, they taste not
comfort in any affliction; whereas the godly, the more they are pressed and
nipped by the schooling hand of their God, the more vehemently they sigh unto
God, and look to his promises with patience and hope. This may teach the
Ministers of God, also, not to be cast down, and discouraged, if their words
ever be not hearkened unto and regarded; since so worthy a man as Moses was in
the house of GOD found this measure. I know, I know the bitterness of it to a
heart that hungreth for their good; but we must be content, we are not like
to them that have spoken in vain to deaf ears before we were borne. The
world will be the world, crooked and cross, froward and unkind, though we
break our hearts in laboring to win to a better course. O, what a thing is
it to come out of Egypt? etc.

6. The^ the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Go speak ver. 10.
to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his
Land. Before you saw how he was bid go to the people, now we hear him sent
to Pharaoh: so is there never any time for men of place and public function
to be idle. Ever, ever, there is some service for them, and an use of their
care, pains, and labor. Now they must defend the oppressed and wronged, now
they must punish the evil dooers, now they must comfort, now they must chide;
that ever they may see and find honor to be a burden and an vnceasing
carefulnes. Private men also may make use of it: for, either in flying evil or
in doing good there is always a care in good minds. But I leave it to your
meditation. I note and see here the bottomless mercy of the Lord, who
although he might justly have given over to favor so froward a company, that
would not hearken to his words and messages sent unto them; yet he does not,
but still continues to have mercy upon them, verifying that speech of the
Prophet David; Even as a Father Psalm. 103.
pittieth his children, so is the Lord merciful to his people. I see it also
here (not without my good) that when Moses had received this discomfort, that
the people would not regard his words, and might stand in a maze what more to
do, the Lord helps him out of this doubt, and sends him to Pharaoh.
Surely, surely, if the Lord helped us not in many mazes that this unkind world
will drive us into, it would be ill with us. But blessed be God that yields
both consilium and auxilium, counsel and help, when we can do neither our
selves. Let it strengthen us to call upon him in all our needs: if some will
not hear us, he can send us to others, and his will be done, say we ever.

7. But Moses spoke unto the Lord, saying, behold the verse. 12.
children of Israel harken not unto me, how then shall Pharaoh hear me who am
of uncircumcised lips? See weakness and wants in the best men still. If Israel
will not hear, he thinks it cannot be that Pharaoh should hear; and a
second stop he makes his own infirmity of speech. But what is not GOD able
to do that his pleasure is to have done? Can he not make some hear what
others would not? the Scripture and our experience are full of examples. The
Ninevites, Jonas, 3. the Samaritanes, John, 4. (...) then we may not at our
selves so much, and what we are in our selves and of our selves, as at the
calling and Office committed to us of God, whose power is ever able to make
good his gracious Commission vouchsafed to his creature, against all fighters
and frowners, striuers and spurners at it. Trusse up thy loins therefore (O
Jeremiah) says God to him) and arise, and speak unto them all that I command
Jeremy. 1. 17.
thee; be not afraid of their faces, lest I destroy thee before them. For I,
behold, I this day have made thee a defenced City, an iron pillar and walls
of brass against 18
the whole Land, against the Kings of Judah, and against the Princes thereof,
against the Priests thereof, and against the people of the Land. For they shall
fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee
17
to deliver thee, says the Lord. The Prophet his fear appears before in the
6. ver; and now this comfort drawn from the authority and function committed to
him, must take away that fear, and give him strength and courage to do what
the Lord calls him unto. The like see in Ezechiel, when God says unto him,
Son of man, Behold, I have made Ezech. 3. 8.
thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their
foreheads. I have made thy forehead as the Adamant, and harder than the flint;
fear them not therefore, 9
neither be afraid at their looks; for they are a rebellious house. At this
day, the Lord does give to his Ministers, the power to bind and loose, and
has published this Speech of unspeakable comfort, He that receaueth you,
receaueth me; and he that despises you, despises me. All which both then and
now had and must have the use I named; even, to draw men from them selves, and
the regard of their own power, to the consideration of their places and
offices vouchsafed of God, and of the strength of him, who is all in all, and
has laid that charge upon them. Not once did it enter into the Lords thought,
to establish hereby a Title to ye Bishop of Rome, above all others to be called
Deus in terris, a God on earth, as his own authentical and allowed book
calls him, saying; Credere Dominum Deum Extrauag. 10. 22 cum inter. in glossa.
nostrum Papam non posse statuere pro vt statuit, haereticum censeretur. To
believe that our Lord God the Pope, may not decree as he decrees, would be
judged heresy. Such an impudent boldness, as a man would not think any should
suffer, had not the Spirit of God foretold us by his blessed Apostle, that the
Man of sin should sit in the temple of 2. Thessa. 2.
God, and show himself as if he were God. Whereunto add that good Saying of S.
Gregory, who, writing of Antichrist, Greg. in Job. cap. 34.
says thus. Cum sit damnatus homo and nequaquam spiritus, Deum se esse
mentitur. Whereas he is a damned man and not a Spirit, by lying he feigneth
himself to be God. Also that of Anselmus; Simulabit se religiosum, vt sub
Anselm. in. 2. These. 1.
specie decipiat pietatis; immo se deum esse dicet, and se adorari faciet, atq:
regna coelorum promittet. Antichrist shall feign himself to be holy, that he
may deceive men under the color of holiness; yea he shall call himself God,
and shall cause himself to be worshipped, and shall promise the kingdom of
Heaven. Things which we all know the Pope does, and no man ever but the
Pope. And hear you what a Note Eusebius makes of this; Hoc est argumentum
Eusebius. de preparat. lib. 7.
eos ^disse Deum, quod velint seipsos appellari Deos. This is a token that they
hate God, because they will have themselves called by the name of God. Iraeneus
that ancient father says, Antichristus existens apostata et latro, quasi Deus
vult adorari; and cum sit seruus, regem vult se preconiari. Antichrist being a
Runagate and a thief, yet will be worshipped as God; and being but a slave,
yet will be proclaimed and published as a King. But you will imagine they have
some shift for this shame, or else it is too shameful. Surely, all the shifts
they have cannot make it otherwise than a most odious insolency, such as might
fully open men's eyes, who are yet deceived to discern the error of their
course in following his law and love against God, Prince, and Country, as many
do; but that the Lord being angry with their contempt of his truth, lets
them still remain in their blindness, as a just punishment of their frowardnes.
Their shift is this, they do not mean he is absolutely God, but in some sense
or respect. For by their Gloss it is said, Papa nec Deus, nec homo, The Pope
is neither God, nor man. And is not this a worthy qualification? Might not all
those, who (as vainly as he) have challenged the Title in like sort, defend it
as he now does? Proud Antiochus, sometime King of Syria, honored Hierony. in
Dan. 3. Suetonius in Domitiano.
himself by the name of God. So the Emperor Domitian used in his
Proclamations, Dominus Deus vester Domitianus. Your Lord God Domitian. So the
Emperor Caligula called himself Deum optimum maximum, and Iouem Latialem. The
best and most mighty God, and the Athenaeus lib. 7.
great Jupiter of Italy. So Sapores the great King of Perfia called himself
Fratre^ Solis and Lunae, The brother of the Sun and the Moon. The peevish
Physician Menecrates called himself Jupiter. Nicagoras made himself a pair
of wings, and would needs be called the God Mercury. Manichaeus the Heretic
called himself the holy Ghost. The Romans erected up an Image in the honor
of Simon Aug. contra Faustum lib. 13. cap. 17. Eusebius. lib. 2. cap. 13.
Magus the Sorcerer, with this poesy: Simoni sancto Deo. To the honor of
Simon the holy God. And did all these well, if the distinction be added of God
absolute, and God not absolute? I think not. Yet which of all these were
comparaable to the Pope in this arrogant vanity, considering the knowledge
that he either has, or ought to have above them. Nevertheless Pope Nicholas
said, Constat summu^ Pontificem a pio Principe Constantino Deum Did. 96.
satis euidenter.
appellatum. It is well known, that of the godly Prince Constantine the Pope
was called God. So in the Counsel of Lateran, this proud Antichrist suffered
one of his Parasites to say, Tu es alter Deus in terris. Thou art another God
in earth. Many other such Stories there are which I pass over, wishing in my
heart, that men would observe and see what is so manifest before their eyes:
that although the Pope by their distinction be not an absolute God, or an
absolute Christ, yet certainly he is a very absolute Antichrist. I end then
this Note with that exposition of Alexander of Hales, our witty Countryman:
Scriptura non dicitde Mose, constituite Deum, sed Deum Pharaonis; hoc est,
potentem super Pharaonem diuinitus. The Scripture says not of Moses, I have
made thee God, but I have made thee Pharaohs God; that is, of power and
strength above Pharaoh, through the hand of God, which is with thee. Nothing
therefore, I say, do Moses words help the Pope, to justify his blasphemous
pride and insolency.

2. And Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet. That is, as he said in ye 4.
Chapter, thy mouth, thy Interpreter, thy Speaker, to utter that eloquently, or
in good words, which thou shall appoint him. Thy Prophet, says Theodoret, as
if God should have said, look how I speak to ye Prophets, and the Prophets to
the people; so shall thou speak to Aaron, as to thy Prophet, and he unto the
people. Where we see ye inco^prehensible Counsel, and wisdom of God, who,
though he could have given to Moses, as well a rolling tongue, as a wise heart:
yet he would not, but to ye one brother gives one gift, to the other another,
that either might have need and use of another, and neither of them be exalted
in contempt of the other. This is that which ye Apostle speaks, when he
says; Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. For 1. Cor. 12.
4. 8.
to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of
knowledge, by the same Spirit: And to 9.
another faith, by the same spirit: to another the gifts of healing, by the
same spirit: And to another the operations of 10.
great works: and to another, prophecy: and to another, the discerning of
Spirits: and to another diversities of tongues: and to another, the
interpretation of tongues. And al these 11.
works one and the self same Spirit, distributing to every man severally as
he will. The holy use whereof we shall take, if reverently we esteem one
another gifts, envying none, despising none, carping, cutting, nipping no man,
but with an humble heart glorifying God our selves, and beseeching him, that in
all our brethren also, together with their several charges, he would glorify
his great Name. A Grace so much the more precious, by how much it is rare, and
too rare, in these last days, wherein the Spirit has foretold us, Men shall
be lovers of themselves, covetous, (...). Tim. 3. 2.
boasters, proud, cursed speakers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, intemperate, fierce,
despisers of 3.
them that are good, Traitors, headie, high minded, lovers of pleasures more
than lovers of God. 4.


3. Thou shall speak all that I command thee. So will verse, 2.
God ever have his Ministers faithful, to keep nothing back of his will
delivered to them, for fear, or flattery of any man; but truly to discharge
the credit reposed in them, leaving the success to him that sent them, and
disposes of all hearts at his pleasure. Thus protests the Apostle very
carefully, we see, when he took his leave of the Elders of Ephesus, saying; I
have kept back nothing that was profitable: but have showed you all the
Counsel of Act. 20. 20.
God. Thus running our race, we shall rest one day in eternal comfort,
delivered from a bitter world, from evil men, and evil natures, taking always
our best endeauours in the worst sense, and rewarding true affection with black
envy, (most unfit for Christians.)

4. But I will harden Pharaohs heart. Heathens could verse 3.
say, A Deo perfecto nihil malum, nihil turpe est. From a perfect God no evil,
nor foul thing comes. Again, Deus malorum causa non est, cum bonus sit: God
is not the Author of evil, when as he himself is good. Therefore, concerning
this hardening of Pharaoh, some understand it by permission; that is, he
suffered him to be hardened; as we say in the Lords Prayer, Lead us not into
temptation; that is, suffer us not to be led. Gregory says, Non duritiem
E^thim. in 5. Math. Greg. moral. 31. ^ap. 12.
contulit, sed exigentibus eius meritis, nulla infusa timoris sensibilitate
molliuit. He did not impose hardness, but his merits so deserving, he softened
him not by any infused sense of fear. Augustine says, God did it ratione
poenae, for Aug. de gra. and lib. arbitrio. cap. 20. 21.
a punishment. And we all know, the Lord is not tied to give his grace to any
man, but it is his mercy, it is his love, and most free he is to do with his
own what he will. Romans 9. 16. 17. 18.
The consideration whereof, should ever work in us care and zeal, to crave at
Gods hands fleshie hearts, which may tremble at his Judgments, and taste his
mercy, saying with Samuel, Speak on, Lord, thy Servant hears; and with
David, O my God, I am content to do it, yea thy law is within my heart. Mark
also here how God fore-tolde them again, that Pharaoh would not hear them.
ver. 4.
A thing so bitter to the faithful Minister of God, as many fore-warnings are
needful unto him, to give him strength against this temptation. O therefore,
that we may ever have patience, who labor in the word and doctrine! God will
do his will, God ought to do his will, our duty is known, we may not
prescribe to him: if we perform what is our part, sweet is our savor (says
the blessed Apostle) as well in them that perish, as in those that are saved:
and it is enough. O Lord, let it be enough to every groaning heart of thy true
Ministers, wishing and seeking to have them saved, who^ thou have created, and
bought with such a price. Thou can make it enough, if it please thee to
bless with thy holy Spirit ye remembrance of it to them that are sliding to
impatiencie.

5. Thus warned, and thus armed, these two brethren Moses and Aaron went unto
Pharaoh, and did even as the ver. 10.
Lord had commanded: and Aaron casts forth his rod before Pharaoh, and it
was turned into a Serpent. The use of which miracle has been told before,
even to strike a fear into Pharaohs heart, that he might the better attend to
what was spoken, and to give him assurance, that, though with his eyes he saw
but the persons of two men, neither glorious, nor terrible in themselves; yet,
with them was the power and strength of the Almighty God, whose hand could
shiuer him in pieces, if he rebelled. So stands it still with Gods Ministers
that faithfully do their duty to the flocks committed unto them; and it
would be thought of, though the persons of such Messengers may be thought
contemptible, yet he that sent them will bear no contempt in the end.

6. But Pharaoh by this miracle was made nothing better. Therefore evidently it
appears that albeit signs and miracles be required of some men, to satisfy
an itching humor to see news, and under a pretense, that if they saw such
things, they would believe: yet indeed these means will not reform them,
but even more and more they become rebellious against the truth, as here was
Pharaoh. Wherefore the Lord does not yield to the foolish fancies of men in
this behalf, but answers in the Gospel to such humors; This adulterous and
crooked generation seeks a sign, but none shall be given them more, than the
sign of Jonas the Prophet. The consideration whereof should make us wise, and
to cease from vain speeches, as, what sign show they? what miracles work
they? with such like; And to keep in the known way, To the Law, and to the
Testimony, that is, to the written Esaias. 8. 20.
word of God, extant among us, confessed and acknowledged by both sides; and if
our doctrine and persuasions be according to that, then are they assuredly
right, then is there light in our doings, and the Sun of true understanding
shines upon us. For the Word is truth, the Word is old and oldest, a
lantern, a rule, a guide, a teacher not to be excepted against ever. This way
does God choose, and try miracles by it, if you remember, in the 13. of Deuteronomy.
not admitting of all the wonders in the world, if Deuteronomy. 13. 1.
they lead contrary to this; neither rejecting this, though there be no daily
wonders added to it, since (the doctrine being the same) the signs and wonders
already done by Christ and his Apostles, mentioned in the Scriptures,
abundantly serve. But how does Pharaoh shift of this great Sign, seeing he is
not disposed to yield to it? surely, if you mark it, even in the very same
sort that some now a-daies do, who talking of Religion, and seeming as if they
were willing to be resolved, when they hear a reason which they cannot
answer, in steed of yielding, say; were such and such here they could
answer you, etc. So plays Pharaoh, he thinks of his wise men and learned
men, whereof Egypt had store: and though he cannot tell what to say himself to
so manifest a Sign, yet he persuades himself they can: and send for them
he will, to see what they can say, rather than yield to the work of God. They
being come, as they were blind themselves, mingling with good learning vain
errors of Magic, incantation, and invocation of Spirits; so, in the just
Judgment of God, they became instruments of blindness unto Pharaoh, to hold
him still in disobedience and hardness of heart against the Lord and his true
Messengers. A thing worthy marking, and due remembrance whilst we live, to
the end we may learn to affect truth better, and to give place to reason in
our hearts and souls, when it is laid before us, without pinning our selves
to other men's sleeves: who erring themselves in that which is sought, though
otherwise happily learned, and to be liked, can never do any better Office to
us than these Enchaunters did to Pharaoh; namely still and still with their
iuglings make us stiff and stubborn against our God, and against our good,
till we perish in Hell, as Pharaoh did in the Red Sea. S. Paul therefore
rightly (naming two of these Enchaunters) compares all false whisperers unto
them, saying: And as Iannes and Iambres withstoode Moses, so do these also 2.
Tim. 3. 8.
resist the truth, men of corrupt minds, reprobate, concerning the faith. But
they shall prevail no longer. etc. verse. 9.


7. But how did these Enchaunters keep Pharaoh in his blindness? The Text
says, They did the like: and so abated 22
the credit of Aarons miracle. Whereupon question is made, whether in deed
and truth they did the like, or only in show by deceauing the sight? And
answer is given by some, that, if we affirm God, in anger and Judgment
toward Pharaoh, to have changed the rods also of the Enchaunters into true
Serpents, there is no absurdity: but other (much better) like to say, there
was a deceauing of sight, and whatsoever show they made, it was but false, and
fantastical: Non fuisse veros dracones, sed sic apparuisse Justinius q. 6. ad
Orthodox. Gref. Nyssen. de vita Mosis. Rupertus and Hugo in Exodus
virtute Daemonis, ex aeris transmutatione. That they were not true Serpents,
but so only seemed to be, by the power of the Devil changing the air. This
then especially is to be noted, that false signs and wonders can be done by
Satan, and his members, God so permitting: and therefore, that we stand fast
in the truth, which we have learned out of Gods Book; and try miracles by
truth, not truth by miracles, according to the Rule of Deuteronomy. 13. 1.
God, taught us in his Word. For, were it never so strange and admirable a
thing, if the drift of it be to lead us from truth to error, the work is
naught; the worker is a deceauer. Antichrist (says the Apostle) shall be
powerful in lying signs, and wonders. In regard of which Admonition, S.
Augustine said, Contra mirabiliarios cautum me fecit Deus meus, etc. Against
wonder-workers and myraclemongers my God has made me wary: foretelling me,
That in the latter days there should be such, which (if it were possible)
should deceive the very Elect. The Schoolmen say here, Moses and Aaron
fecerunt miraculum; Magi autem mirum, non miraculum. Moses and Aaron did a
miracle, but the Enchaunters did a marvel, no miracle: meaning, because what
they did was counterfeit. But I stand not upon it. It is further most worthy
marking here, that Aaron his Rod devoured their rods: for thereby verse. 12.
we are notably taught the end of falshoode and error; at the last Truth shall
devour it in Gods good time: for, Magna est veritas, and praeualet. Great is
truth, and prevails. If you continue in my word, says our blessed Savior,
John. 8. 31. 32.
you shall know the truth; and the truth shall make you free. Yet Pharaoh
could not see, but his heart was still hardened: even as in our times we know
the fearful ver. 13.
blindness of some, in the greatest light that may be given them. A wise heart
will note this earnestly: and neither be moved to such obstinacy, nor cease to
fear the like judgment, if unthankfully Gods favor vouchsafed, be passed
over. Much does God for either man, or place, when he graciously gives good
Teachers; and where such Enchaunters as these, are received and hearkened unto,
what can follow, but Pharaohs hard heart to eternal woe? Beware, beware,
whilst God gives you time. To day if you will hear his voice, harden not
your heart. How know you what judgment and wrath to morrow day may bring
upon you? Truth may be oppressed for a time, God so pleasing, either to punish,
or try his people; but finally suppressed it shall not be; God being stronger
than all his enemies, and able to disperse all duskie clouds, bringing his
glorious truth out, to bear sway again, at his good pleasure. Simplex and
nuda est, sed efficax and magna. It is simple and naked, says One, but
powerful and strong. Splendet cum obscuratur, and vincit cum opprimitur. It
shines even when it is darkened, and overcomes when it is oppressed.

The 2. part.
THese things thus passed over, the holy Ghost comes to show the first of
those ten plagues, which the King, and his people tasted of; namely, of the
turning of their waters into blood; whereby their fish died, and both verse.
17. etc.
man and beast were perplexed. Of this plague there is a Denuntiation. ver. 17.
18. etc. Secondly, an Execution, ver. 22. 23. Thirdly, an Event, which again
is threefold. 1. A Conversion of the waters into blood, 2. An Imitation of
this miracle by the Enchaunters, who did the like. ver. 25. And lastly, an
Increase of hardness in Pharaohs heart, when he had seen all this. ver. 25.
26. Concerning some profitable use of all which to our selves, thus may we
meditate and think of them.

1. God tells Moses, that Pharaoh in the morning 15.
will come to the water, to wit, unto the river Nilus, and there he should
meet him. Whereby we see the truth of the Psalmist his speech, O Lord, thou
have searched me out, and known me, thou know my down sitting, and mine
vprising; yea, thou understand my thoughts, and that long before, thou art
about my bed, and about my paths, and spiest out all my ways. What care then
should we have of our actions, when every step of ours is thus known to God?
He knows, you see, which way we will walk in the morning, before ever we
go out of our houses; and he knows all, to go no further in this matter.

2. We see again, how the Lord smites the waters here, that the Egyptians
might know, as also all the 17.
world besides, how the Lord our God has power over all his creatures, to give
the use of them to us, and to take the use of them from us, at his pleasure.
Interpreters upon this place say, Hanc plagam intulit Deus propter pueros
^udeorum in aquis immersos, fluuius enim mutatus in sanguinem conqueritur de
c^de puerorum per eos commissa. This plague GOD brought upon them for the
children which were drowned, and the river thus turned into blood, complained
to God for that slaughter, says Theodoret. Origin Theodoret in Exodus Origin in
Exodus Aug. de miraescripturae. ca. 17. verse. 18. Aug. de mirac. scrip. cap. 7.
and Augustine say it was poena culp^, the punishment of sin, meaning the
drowning of the children. That which is added in the Text, And it shall grieve
the Egyptians to drink, Austine says of it thus, Bibentibus erat exitiu^, non
bibe^tibus p^na, obsitim qua^ sustinebant. Unto the^ that drank, it was death,
unto the^ that drank not, it was a great punishment, for the thirst which they
sustained. Josephus in like sort, Si bibebant, co^festim ^^ri dolor
corr^piebantur* and hoc forsan Textus innuit, cu^ dicit, afflig^^tur Egipti^.
If they drank, Josephus. 2 antiq: cap. 13.
by and by they were taken with a bitter grief; and this peradventure the Text
means, when it says, It shall grieve the Egyptians to drink. Philo says,
Hominum siti enectorum magnus numerus ace uatim iacebat in triuijs, non Philo
de vita Mosis.
sufficientibus domesticis ad sepultu^e officia. A great number of men dead
with thirst lay by h^apes in the streets and highways, their household
friends (or servants) being not enowe to bury them. Such a plague was this
turning of their waters into blood.

3. We may further note an increase of terror in this miracle, above the
former of the Serpents. For, as you plainly see, it was far greater and more
(...)efull. And we may thereby learn this good Lesson, ^^at where milder
means will not serne, God both c^^, and will add sharper, and heavier. The
Serpents before were a fair warning; but yet, because they hurt no man, they
profited few men. Now therefore he will touch them a little nearer, he will
strike the water, which neither man nor beast may want, and so see if their
hearts will yield obedience to his will. Thus assuredly deals he with men and
women at this day, but (peradventure) it is not marked. He increases his
crosses, from goods to body, from body to mind, from ourselves to our
children, and still makes us abound with more want and woe, in greater and
sharper measure, that we may repent and turn, if we will be persuaded: if
not, in the end he can make an end, and finally destroy us with misery that
shall never end. O that we may have then wise hearts, to observe the steps and
degrees of Gods dealing with us, profiting by the lesser, and so preventing the
greater, to his good contentment, and our everlasting comfort, and safety.
Nilus was a river wherein they much gloried, receiving by it great riches, and
great defense: wherefore, to see this river turned into blood so fearefullie,
might well have smitten their hearts, and made them humble themselves to God;
but nothing will humble some men: neither entered all this into Pharaohs heart;
which hardness is ever a fearful sign, and to be prayed against. Mark it
also, how, if we stoop not to God, but continue obstinate, by degrees he will
come to our nearest and dearest comforts. Thus, I hope, if you read this
Chapter over again in your Bible, you s^e some measure of the use of it, which
is the thing I aim at, to encourage you to the reading of the Text: and then
daily more and more reading, with godly Prayer, and Meditation, shall yield
further use and profit in many things: the holy Scriptures being as a deep
water, wherein the greatest Lion may swim, and the greatest vessel touch no
bottom. Let this much therefore suffice of this Chapter.

CHAP. 8.
In this Chapter are set down three fearful plagues more. The plague of
Frogs. The plague of Lice. The plague of Flies.


1. WHereof to make use to our instruction and reformation, let us consider
this gracious Admonition in the first verse, vouchsafed to Pharaoh again. Let
my people go that they may verse. 1.
serve me. Can there any thing be sweeter to the Child of God, than to mark,
how slow the Lord is to punish, and how desirous of amendment without
punishment? O how may my Soul assure it self of mercy, if penitentially I
seek it, where such a Nature is? Cannot he endure to punish Pharaoh, a proud
and haughty rebel against his Divine will? and will he willingly smite my
poor soul, your poor soul, or any poor soul bruised and broken with the
sense of sin, and groaning, and sighing for one drop of mercy at his hand?
No, no, there is mercy with the Lord, and therefore shall he ever be feared;
He is slow Psalm. 103. 8. 9. 10
to anger, and of great kindness. He will not always chide, neither keep his
anger for ever. He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities. For as high as the Heaven is above the Earth, 11.
so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far 12.
as the East, is from the West, so far has he removed our sins from us.
As a Father has compassion on his 13
Children, so has the Lord compassion on them that fear him. For he knows
whereof we be made: he remembers 14.
that we are but dust. Therefore he admonishes, as we see in this place,
again and again, before he will let his rod fall upon very Pharaoh. Who will
not hearken then unto his sweet Uoice, and be admonished by so loving a
Father, so merciful a God, and so powerful a Creator? Surely if we smart,
we must needs approve his Justice, for his Mercy is manifest, we cannot
deny it. Yet, yet, says this gracious God, go to Pharaoh, and warn him
again, that he may be wise, and let my people go.

2. And if thou will not let them go, says the Lord, (...).
behold I will smite thy Country with Frogs. Giving us herein again to
observe, that if Mercy be refused, he is also just, and the rod shall fall
with stripe after stripe, till either we cry penitently, Peccaui, I have
sinned, or be consumed in his wrath, from the face of the earth. Remember that
Place of places in Deuteronomy. And if this people will Deuteronomy. 31. 16.
rise up, and go a whoring after the Gods of a strange Land, and will forsake
me, and break my covenant which I have made with them; my wrath will wax hot
against 17
them at that day (O note) and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from
them: then they shall be consumed, and many adversities and tribula(...)ons
shall come upon them: so then they will say, Are ^^t these troubles come upon
me, because God is not w^^h me? but I will surely hide 1^.
my face, etc. A Place never to be forgotten, if we desire to fear God.
Remember ^lso among many more the fit Example of Haman, that proud enemy to
Gods truth, and people, to whom it was thus said. If thou begin to fall,
Hester. 6. 13.
thou shall surely fall. As if they should say, fall upon fall, and still more
and more falling will follow, when God is once angry. Happy, happy then is
the heart that feels, yields, turns, and cleaves fast unto the Lord.

3. Mark also, and consider in this place, how the case is altered with Gods
people, and their enemies. For till now, we have heard but of the Israelites
afflictions, how still they suffered, and were ill entreated, having sore
burdens laid upon them, and most bitter griefs daily heaped unto their
hearts. But now we see a change, they are spared, they are comforted, and they
are defended, when these dreadful plagues light upon their enemies, one after
another. So, so shall the sorrows of the godly be ever turned into joy, when
the Lord sees his time, and the fading comforts of the wicked turned into
weeping, and woeful lamentation. Your sorrow, says our Savior Christ, shall
Luke, 6, 25.
be turned into joy; and, woe be to them that laugh now, for they shall wail
and weep. Be of good comfort then in your self, when you read this, and
profit your heart with this Note or Meditation. The changes of this world are
many, but with Gods faithful people it shall ever be well in the end.

4. It is further to be observed in this your Chapter, how the Lord with
variety and vehemency of words does amplify this plague, not only saying,
He will send Frogs (which yet had been fearful,) but that the rivers should
2. 3.
scrawle full of Frogs, that they should go up, and come into the Kings house
and into his bedchamber where he slept, and upon his bed, and into the house
of his servants, and upon his people, and into his ouens, and into his kneading
troughes, yea says he, the frogs shall climb up upon thee, and on thy
people, and upon all thy servants. verse. 4.
The like vehemency does he use in that notable chapter, the 28. of Deuteronomy.
amplifying both sides with many words, and great variety of phrase, full of
force and edge, all assuredly to move, and pierce, but it would not be. Thus
deals he at this day with his people, he gives unto them sometimes Pastors
and Teachers, who rightly may be called Sons of thunder, in regard of their
^arnest and vehement exhortations, threatening, and denouncing Gods wrath and
judgments due to disobedience and st^bbornesse; and even as Pharaoh here could
not be touched, no more will many at this day; no vehemence moves, but al is
one. If the fervent spirit of the Preacher should break and ^eare his inwards
in pieces, all is one: men snort and fleepe, and go on in a most damnable
dullness of mind, till the Lord himself start up, and revenge his own
contempt upon them, and their posterity. The old world would not believe the
threatened Flood, neither the stobborne Jews, that the Chaldean King should
come upon them. But when they cried to their souls, pax, pax, peace, peace,
(for all this earnestness of Ier. 2.
the Preacher) then came sudden and fearful destruction upon them, as they
deserved. So ever, so ever let us be sure, first, or last. And therefore make
use of vehemence, when God directs his Preacher to it.

5. But what an army is this against such a Prince? Had God neither men, nor
Angels to command? Yes, yes, it needs no proof: we know both men, and
Angels commanded by him at his pleasure. But here he would use neither,
deeming it fit to confound the pride of such a conceited king by an host of
frogs, rather than by either of the other. So shall the Lord, by contemptible
and base things, cast down our high looks, if we swel against him. He would
also have Pharaoh hereby see how easily he could destroy him, if he l^st, when
such heaps of loathsome creatures so soddainly could be raised to torment
him. And the same he would have all high minds at this day see, making use
thereof unto humility, before they find it is too late. For as easily can the
Lord now raise up strange plagues, as then. Varro writes that a city in
France was driven away with this very plague of frogs. A town in Thessaly
rooted up and ouerthrown with moules. A whole land forced to remove with mice,
and many such things have Stories left to our remembrance. There was a time,
when the French disease was not so common, nor our English sweat known. That
plague of the Philistines 1. Sam. 5. 6.
with the Emerods in their hinder parts is in Gods Cronicle. That consumption
of Herod with lice, and Act. 12. 23. 2. Macab. 9. 9.
that fearful example of Antiochus, they ought both to be marked; but nothing
shall profit, except Grace be given from above. And therefore a feeling heart
of flesh, the Lord, for his mercy sake, ever grant unto us.

6. And the Sorcerers did likewise with their sorceries, and brought frogs up
upon the land of Egypt. Out of Ver. 7.
which words, besides yt which has been noted before, this meditation may
arise, how Gods adversaries seek often to oppugn the truth by the self same
means whereby he does teach it. As, if Scripture be alleged, Satan will
Math. 4 Esaias. 2^. 2. Ier. 7. 2. 1. King. 22. 11
do the like; if the true Prophets use a sign, then will Zidkia make him
horns to, and say, when went the spirit from me, to thee? All which God does
suffer, to draw us forward to true and sound knowledge, without which we
cannot stand, but shall be shaken to and fro, with doubts and fears, and
wavering conceits, most unfit for believers, (The words of the Apostle
calling upon us to be steadfast, immovable, abounding always in the work of
the Lord. Not to he carried about with every blast of vain doctrine, but to
continue grounded and stablished Collos. 1. 23.
in the says, not moved away from the hope of the Gospel, etc,) Saint Peter
in like manner admonishes to beware of being plucked away with the error of
the wicked, 2. Pet. 3. 17. 2. Pet. 2. 15.
and of falling from steadfastness; noting those that forsook the right way,
and followed the way of Balaam. Labor we therefore to know how we stand, and
building upon the rock indeed, though such iug^ing Sorcerers as these arise
in the world, and Apishly follow that course to subvert, which Gods Ministers
follow to strengthen, yet they shall not shake us, but we patiently abiding a
time, settled upon our true grounds, the falsehood shall appear at last, and all
their follies be discovered in the end, to the honor of God, the glory of his
truth, the comfort of his children, and the confusion of such Egyptian Jugglers
for ever. Gamaliel could note it, that Theudas had his time, yet in the end
fell with all his followers. That Judas of Galilie Act. 5. ^^.
had his time, and drew away much people after him; but at last he perished,
and the people were scattered. Let not Gamaliel be wiser than we, to observe
good things for his instruction.

7 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, ver. ^.
pray ye unto the Lord, that he may take away the frogs, from me, and from my
people, and I will let the people go, etc. Why does he not make his Wisemen
take them away, his Inchaunters and Sorcerers, that could set a show of making
the like? Could they cause frogs to come, and not go? Or, why does he not
call to his gods and Idols to help him to take them away? Can none help him
but Moses and Aaron, by praying for him? See then how the Lord (when he
pleases) is able to force the wicked to the acknowledgment of him, and his
true Ministers; and let it comfort us in the midst of all contempts, either
of our God, of our faith, and religion, or of our persons. He can bring them
down that look so coy, If prosperity will not* adversity shall. Psalm. ^8.
34. 2. Maccab. 9. Apoc. 3. (...).
by touches of body, pinches in mind, losses in goods and infinite ways. And
if therefore it please him a while to endure their pride, we also must endure
it, and not grieve at it. These exampels must be ready in our minds ever,
when we see such things. Not long since this proud Pharaoh said, WHO IS THE
LORD? But now he sees, and Cap. 5. 2.
must confess, that there is no help, but in this Lord. His Gods are weak,
and the frogs crawled in despite of them. Moses therefore must pray to his God
to help, and take them away. And who now, but Moses and Aaron, with Pharaoh?
Ah we despised Ministers by the proud worldlings! let us mark it, and bear
their co^tempts. In their extremities they shall acknowledge our callings,
justify our love, and wish our prayers: They shall stoop, they shall stoop,
when our God pleases, and it is enough. Remember that great Nabuchadnezar, how
the Lord Dan. 4 22.
stouped him, till he should know, that the Lord rules. Pray, pray for us (O
Samuel) said the stobborne Israelites (when God would,) and so they came to
him, whom they erst neglected. Men and brethren what shall we do? said they,
being touched, that before thought much to be advised by such men. Jeroboam
sends to the Prophet, whose doctrine he would not follow, and no worse a
messenger, than his own wife, and in his heart he acknowledges, that truth is
with him. The great Turk in these days will seek the prayers of
Christian-men, when yet he fights against the truth that they embrace. And
many (which at other times regard them not) either going to sea, or to
battle, or being sick, and vexed at home, will send, and seek for the
prayers, and comfort of Gods Ministers. And what is this, but a sign of Gods
Omnipotent hand over all Pharaohs whatsoever, and that he can revenge our
contempts, and give our truth, and careful walking in our places, a due
regard and reverence, when he will, with them, and in them? Let the
sweetness of it joy us, and make us possess our souls in patience. Dives,
that rich glutton, shall see Lazarus right, and himself wrong, one day.

8 But why does Pharaoh now call, rather than in the former plague, for Moses
and Aaron to pray? Surely because this plague more nipped him than the former.
For when the rivers were blood, he might have wine to drink, and by that
means not find the smart so much. See we then, howbeit other men's harms
should affect us; yet, unless the Lord touch our selves, we are dull, and
dead, without sense. Which certainly makes God reach us a blow many times,
when otherwise he would spare us, did we make good use of our Brethrens harms.
Apply therefore ever to your self Gods doings, saying in your heart; and why,
Lord, am I not so also? Do not I also offend thee? Father of Heaven, and God
of all mercy, make me wise by other men's harms, and thankful unto thee, that
I am so schooled, rather than with mine own woe.

9. See how ready Moses is to pray for Pharaoh, when ver. 9.
he bids him to appoint the time himself of his prayer: and let it make us
think with our selves, whether we be thus hearted, to pray readily, and
willingly for Prince, for Country, for friends, and family; yea, let it open
unto us, what I fear is too true, that in our lives, scarce once, we have
been upon our knees for any of these, but even go on in a common course,
haling and pulling with the world all the week long, and on the Holiday go to
the Church, rather for fashion, than devotion, praying with lips, not with
heart, a few words, and then spending all the rest of the time, either in
sleeping, or gazing, or thinking of matters little belonging to God. O that we
may profit by this readiness in Moses, to pray for such a wicked king. Remember
the Scriptures, where you see, how fathers and mothers have gone to Christ for
their children, Masters for their servants, and neighbors for their friends.
Christ is th(...)me, and why should not we also be the same? and Morning and
Evening go unto God for our selves, and ours, as here did Moses for Pharaoh?

10. It may be moved for a question, why Pharaoh being offered to appoint the
time himself, appointed the next day, saying, To morrow, rather than
presently, the Frogs being so ugly, and no place free from them, no not the
Kings Chamber? Who would not have cried now now, even forthwith, pray, that I
may be delivered from this plague, rather than to have stayed till the next
day? It is answered, first, that he still doubted, whether it was the Finger
of God, or an enchauntment: and therefore was content to defer the time, to
try whether of it self it would pass away, and so to discredit Moses and
Aaron. Such hollow holes are in Hypocrites hearts, when they seem religious,
and careful of Prayer, or other good things. Secondly, herein he showed the
nature of the wicked, who not only defer their own duties from day to day,
but (as much as they can) put over others also, that offer good things unto
them: as for example, if a Preacher tender his service this Sabbath, he is
told, the next will be far more fit: and, if he come also the next Sabbath,
then is either the Master from home, the Gentlewoman sick, the weather too
hot, or cold, or some such thing; that, be Moses never so ready, yet Pharaoh
is not ready, but cras, cras, to morrow, to morrow, is still the song, till
the Lord strike, and all Morrowes end, we passing away to woe without end, for
our deferring. That Moses takes his own time, and says, Be it as thou have
said, it is to teach him, that at all times the Lord is the Lord, his miracles
no enchauntments, but a powerful working for his own glory, and the gracious
Deliverance of his Church.

11. Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: Verse 12.
and Moses cried unto the Lord concerning the Frogs, etc. Why went Moses
forth? might not he have stayed in the Court, and have prayed there? God
forbid, but we should think Courts to be places of prayer, for such as have a
censcience, in every place to lift up hands, and heart to God: yet, would God
also, the hindrances and impediments so to do in those places, were fewer!
Surely great Courtiers are found, that a meaner place has yielded their
hearts more heat to good things, than those glistering places have, as
sometimes a Country House, and sometimes a dark hole in a close prison. Moses
cried unto the Lord, says the Text, and prayer does, what neither doors, nor
locks, nor any strength, or wit of man could do; the weapons of Gods children
are such, and so mighty. The word of Crying notes the vehemency of Moses
prayer, against cold formalitie, too common in most prayers. It notes not any
loudnes of voice (although that also be lawful at times) since the same Moses
is said Exodus 14. 15.
to cry in another place, when he spoke not a word, but from his inward
Spirit. Ezechias thus cried unto his God, and escaped both a mortal disease,
and the huge host of the Assyrians. But what prayer can do, I hope you know,
and therefore go no further.

12. And the Lord did according to the Saying of Moses. Verse 13.
See the credit that Gods servants have with their merciful God: they ask,
and he gives without any stop. Can you think, God hears Moses alone? no,
says the Psalm, God is near unto all that call upon him; yea to Psalm. 145.
18. 19.
all, all, and ever remember it. He will fulfill the desire of all them that
fear him; he will hear their cry, and will save them. The Lord preserves
all them that love him: 20. 21.
but he will destroy all the ungodly. Wherefore, my mouth shall speak the
praise of the Lord, and all flesh shall bless his holy Name for ever and ever.
Daily experience shows the like, and therefore as Moses here (even despised
Moses) was stronger with his God, and by his God, than all Egypt, to remove a
plague; so shall we ever be more strong than our enemies, in what God shall
see us fit to be enabled. Wherefore one Moses is better for a kingdom, than
many others, that are judged to be of greater virtue, etc.

13. So the Frogs dyed in the houses, in the towns, and in the fields. And
they gathered them together on heaps, and the Land stanke of them, says the
Text. Had Verse 13. 14.
it not been as easy for the Lord to have taken them quite away? assuredly to
the Lord all was one: but this was done, to show the truth of the miracle,
that they were Frogs indeed, and no enchauntments; thereby to meet with the
unbelief of the King, and all his Courtiers, who either openly in words, or
secretly in heart thought otherwise. And by one means, or other, the Lord
shall ever, in his good time, deliver his truth from false surmises, his
faithful Ministers from false imputations, and write the wickedness of
Atheists, and carnal men, upon their faces to their confusion. Only be we
patient, to tarry his will, to like of his way, and be we assured, we shall
both see his glory, and receive comfort.

14. But when Pharaoh saw that he had rest given him, he hardened his heart,
and hearkened not unto them, as the Verse 15.
Lord had said. See the corruption of our nature, if God work not. No sooner
is the rod off, but as the Dog to his vomit, and the Sow to her mire, so
wretched man returns to his old bias, and falls to his former sin
again. When we are sick, or distressed any way, we pretend repentance, we
pray, we cry, we vow, and what not (in show?) But forasmuch as all rises
from fear, and not from love, it vanishes again, as soon as the fear is
past; and the Devil returns with seven worse than himself, making our end
more odious, than ever our beginning was. This has been touched before, but
yet ever mark it, and fear it your self, as you have a care to please God.
For if you forsake God, you can never blame God, if he forsake you, and if,
after God has given you rest, you become retchlesse, as Pharaoh was here; then
if, as he in the sea, so you in eternal woe be drowned for ever, you have
your desert, and GOD is just.

15. The Frogge is (as we all know) a foul filthy creature, abiding in
foul places, as bogges, and myrie plashes all the day long, and at night
peeping out with the head above the water, making a hateful noise with many
others of his sort, till the day appear again. Wherefore Divines have
thought, that by these foul creatures fitly might be resembled such croking
Crues, as hiding themselves all the day in an Ale den, or such like place of
uncleanness, as soon as night comes, put out their heads, and make a
hateful noise against Governors and Superiors, neighbors, and honest
persons, till all that hear them be weary of them. Which filthy Frogs the
Lord assuredly will deal with all in his good time, as here he did with these
Egyptian Frogs: namely, kill them, destroy them, and make the stinch of them
known to many. Till then, let patience and righteous dealing be the armor of
the godly, and withal, how many of such ugly creatures this world has, let
it be considered: that thereupon may arise this fruitful Meditation, how
little cause good men and women have, to be in love with this world, to build
tabernacles in it, and to say and think it is good being here; but rather to
sigh, and wish to be loosed, and to live there, where the Elect of God, having
the Harpes of Apoc. 15. 2. 3.
God, sing the song of Moses, where they cry Hallelu-iah, Apoc. 19. 1.
salvation, and glory, and honor, and power be to the Lord, etc. O difference
of places, if we had eyes, or heads, or hearts! God, God, for his Christ sake,
give us feeling. Amen.

The 3. plague of Lice.
THis is the 3. plague, which the Lord by his mighty power brought upon this
hard hearted King, and his ver. 16. 17.
people, see king thereby their good, but prevailed not. In which also (for our
instruction) we may observe diverse things. As first, why the Lord did not
bring again upon them his former plagues, either of Frogs, or bloody water,
letting them rest upon them till they were stouped; but still brings new, and
others than the former? Whereunto we may answer, that the Lord did this, to
show, that his power was not tied to any one thing, but by infinite ways able
to punish sinners, if they will be stubborn, more and more, so to fear them,
and by them, us, to the worlds end. Which, happy we, if it do to amendment,
that his many, and strange, and dreadful plagues, may be ever and ever far
from us.

2. We may note that as easy it had been for the Lord, to have turned the
dust into Lions, and Bears, and Wolves, both of strange greatness, and cruel
fiercenes; but that rather he chose to confound pride by weakness, and a
rebelling humor by so base a creature, as at other times often he used to
do. And more it fretteth a high mind, as you may note in Abimelech, who
sought of his servant to slay him, rather than it should be said, that a Judge.
9. 54.
woman had overcome him. In us let it work thus much, that if such a vile
creature may (by God) be made too strong for a Kingdom, what resistance can I,
one man, or one woman make against the Lords wrath, if I pull it upon me by my
sins, by my proud, haughty, and careless heart? His wrath can arm all the
creatures in Heaven, and Earth against me; and yet the least of them is thus
far above my power, as you see here. Wicked are the words of some profane
mouths at times, saying, Let us have our will now, and we will shift then. O
vain heart, what shift can it think of against such a GOD? Shake and tremble
at this dulnes betimes, lest the plague of it shiuer thee in pieces for
evermore. The water crusheth Pharaoh, and all his people in the Kingdom; the
Earth now also sends vermin upon him, and he cannot shift against such a
vile and contemptible creature. Follow this Meditation in your mind, and let
it profit you: for, before the face of his wrath, who can stand? Nahum. 1. 6.
verse. 18.


3. Now the Enchaunters assayed likewise with their Enchauntments to bring
forth Lice, but they could not. Powerful then is the Devil, when God will
suffer him; but when God will restrain him, what can he do? And this to ye
Story of Job, to the Story of ye heard of Swine in the Gospel, and such other
places; and grow we in comfort against this deadly foe of ours. For we see his
weakness, and the bridling hand of God at all times over him, when God
pleases. Fear God, and fear not Satan; but contemn God, and then shake to
think of Satan's fierce rage, when once he has leave given to torment thee.

4. Behold again a good thing: before, the Inchanters did the like, but here
now they cannot for their lives. As then a time there is of trial betwixt
contrary opinions, and crossing miracles, that they which are of God may be
known: so is there a time, even a joyful happy time, when the Lord will cut of
that difference and mismaze, that doubting, that iuggling, and deceiptful
working, and give his truth victory over all Inchanters: James and Iambres 2.
Tim. 3. 8.
witstood Moses, says the Apostle, and so did some then, and yet now with us,
resist the truth, Men of corrupt minds, and reprobat, concerning the faith.
But Moses had victory over those of his time, and the Apostle says, the other
of his time shall no longer prevail, their madness being manifest to all men.
Therefore, for them of our time, we may not doubt of like success against
them: only let us have patience (as I often say) till the time come. Ways can
he nener want to overthrow them, when in such weak creatures, as these were,
he is so strong. A seely simple man in the famous Counsel of Nice without
Logic, or Rhetoric, or any help of the Arts, gave that vaunting
Philosopher an overthrow; and gained him from his vanity unto God; the Story
is known, and I pass it over. In our times women and children have foiled
Doctors, yt even out of babes and sucklings mouths, the praise of God might be
ordained. In some thing or other shall falsehood still fail, that such as have
eyes may see the truth. Amplify it further as you please, for (God be thanked)
there be many proofs.

5. Then said the Inchanters to Pharaoh, This is the ver. 19.
finger of God. Wherein observe, how the wicked, who, for a time, make show, as
though God were on their side, in Gods good time shall be forced to acknowledge
the contrary, to his glory, and the great comfort of his Church, and
children. For, what are these words other in sense, than (as if they should
have said) we have hitherto deluded the eyes and senses of the beholders by
our enchantments; but now we are no more able to do so? This which is now done
passes our skill, and albeit the creature be vile and base, yet is the power
of God such over us, and our Art, that we cannot do the like, but give him
the victory, and acknowledge our selves sinful, weak, and wicked men? Thus
were Nabuchadnezzar in Daniel, and Antiochus in Dan. 2. 3. 2. Maccab. 9.
the Maccabies, drawn to confess Gods power over them, and all their
greatness. Which certainly is an unspeakable comfort to all that depend upon
him in their troubles. For what can any man do against you, against me, or any
other, more than this God, (so potent, and puisant) will give him leave to do?
and what leave will he give him more, than in the end shall turn to our good,
for whom he has not spared, to give his dearest son to death, that ever we
might be assured of him?

6. Yet Pharaohs heart, says the Text, remained still obstinate, and he
hearkened not unto them, etc. So laying before us a notable example of the
rooted wickedness in man's heart, being left of God unto itself. For, as now
you see, not his own inchanters move him any thing at all, though they
acknowledge before him the power of God. It makes me think of some men in
our days, who by no means can be won to the truth, no not by their own
men, (who sometimes have erred, as now they do, but in the mercy of God have
received light) both speaking, and writing what should profit others. This is a
fearful hardness to be prayed against by all that have a care of their own
salvation.

The fourth plague of Flies.
1. THese things thus passed over, the Lord hastes ver. 24.
to an other plague, seeing the former could not move: and as Pharaohs malice
increased, so sharper and sharper is the Lords hand. For now comes a plague
most bitter to him, and all his: even swarms of very noisome creatures, Flies,
Waspes, Hornets Canker-wormes, Locusts, Scorpious, and such like; so that now
most fearfully they were vexed in every place. Divines meditating upon this
plague, have resembled unto it those cares and thoughts, wherewith worldly men
are usually vexed: for, as the Flies did never suffer the Egyptians to sleep
or take any rest; so do those cares torment all day and night. Others have
resembled those bitings and touchings of conscience, which men so grieuouslie
often feel, to these Flies; because, as in the one, so in the other, the
grief is greater than can be expressed. Again because, as these Flies were a
punishment, forerunning the deliverance of Gods people; so these agonies of
mind going before, great and Heavenly comfort does usually follow. A thing
worthy of remembrance to troubled minds and full of contentment, if they will
hold fast by him, that is always merciful, and calls unto him all that
travel, and are heavy laden. Others considering the nature of these Flies have
compared Tyrants and oppressors of their weaker brethren unto them. For, as
these Flies sucked-out the Egyptians blood with biting, and stinging and
causing, of smart; so do such cruel men, till they have gorged themselves
with sinlful spoils of their Christian brethren. There be great Flies, and
those be Great men, that tyrannously rule, not shearing, but shauing to the
very skin, if they take not skin and all. There be lesser Flies, and those
be usurers, and other biting binders, who with their Nouerint Vniuersi, make an
universal ruin of many a man's estate, and so fetch him in still with the
Condition of the Obligation, that in the end his Condition is woeful, and his
heart breaks with the bitter grief of Be it known unto all men. Surely
these are cursed Flies indeed, the suckers of our sap, the bibbers of our
blood, the pinchers of our hearts, and the stingers, and wringers of our very
souls. The Egyptian Fly was nothing like unto them, but yet, you see, was a
great plague of God sent to punish the sin of men. But let them remember that
these Flies of Egypt had but a time; God sent them in wrath, and took them
away in mercy, upon entreaty. Some Moses, or other shall stand up; and the
Lord shall send a strong west-winde, to take these Canker-wormes away, and
cast them into the Red Sea, that in our roast they may torment no longer.
Philo, the Jewe, in the life of Moses, says, that because the Egyptians did
(as it were) sting the Israelites with many biting and bitter words, scoffs
and scorns, taunts and iestes; therefore the Lod sent these Flies and Hornets
among them, that one thing might be punished with an other. And most certain
it is, that such Stingers shall be punished, as God shall think good in his
due time.

2. These Flies were not in the land of Goshen, and that (says the Text)
because God made a separation. Verse, 22. 23.
Wherein we profitably learn, that whenever we are free from any calamity,
or grief, which happens t^ others, it is not by our own virtue or policy,
but by that gracious separation, which the Lord makes: whose mercy and love
that we might more fully see, he saves us from that evil. Wherein how may we
run into perti^nlars, since we were borne, and have had dealings in the
world? Others sickly, we healthie; others wath, we sufficient; others in
continual pain and labor, we in rest, and ease, and comfort; others in
prison, we at liberty; others in blindness, we in light; others sclaundered,
we not touched; others crossed in their children, and friends, we comforted;
others wake, we sleep; others weep, we sing; and, which is the top and
height of all misery, others are so tempted, that they violently cast
themselves away, when we in the mean time feel no temptation. O blessed God,
what a separation is this. Let us ever think of it, and be thankeful for it.

3 When Pharaoh and his people were vexed with this Plague, Moses and Aaron,
according to his former manner were called for, and license given them to go,
and do sacrifice, but with limitation (in this Land) and when that Ver. 25.
would not satisfy Moses (for the reasons mentioned in the twenty six verse,)
then it is enlarged to the wilderness Ver. 28.
also, but yet again limited, (Go not far away.) Where we are to mark the
fashion, not only of worldly Princes, but of all wordlie and earthly minded
men, how they can, upon urgent necessity, be content to tolerate Religion, so
it might still be joined with their profit: but if it be once contrary to that,
O how bitter then* how hard then to endure it, and give it free, and loving
passage! For these Jews wholly to depart from Egypt, was not for Pharaohs
profit (for from their labors he had great gain) and therefore by no means
may they go out of his land, to sacrifice to their God, but in the land he is
content to endure them, so he may be freede from these plagues, that so
fearfully God sent upon his people. Or, if it needs must be, that they must
go forth of the Land, yet not far away in any case. Thus was he, thus are
many at this day, and to the worlds end these wretches will not want, who have
their gain for their God, and no other Religion will ever like, than what may
stand with the same, as much as possibly they can procure. Let us see it, and
mark it, and hate it; for it is not that which can please God. If we be risen
with Christ, we must seek the things that Colos. 3. 1.
are above: and, if we love any thing more than him, we never can enjoy him.
His kingdom is not of this world; and if our joy and glory be in it, we are
not his followers. Love not this world, says Saint John, neither any thing in
1. John. 2. 15.
this world. For, if the love of the world be in us, the love of God is not in
us. That builder of greater barnes for his large commings in, was but a fool,
in his eyes, who only is wise: and when his soul was taken away, whose were
all his toils and travels? That purple pampered Glutton went to the Devil,
and with all his worldly wealth could not procure one drop of water, to cool
his scalded tongue. The gain of Gold makes many loose their souls. The greedy
wretch that for himself still spares, does hoord-up nothing but continual
cares. Hermocrates, lying at the point of death, bequeathed his goods to none,
but himself. The fire burns ^^ercer the more it has, and so the worlds
worms. The Bees do flock to the honey dew, and so these wretches unto gain.
The greatest fish devour the smaller fry, and so these wretches, their weaker
brethren, In aworde, as you never see the Sea without waves, so shall you never
see these wretches without woes. And as the clouds do hide the Suns light,
so their greedy hearts repel Gods grace. But let this suffice touching some
use of this Chapter. (reversed)

CHAP. 9.
The chief heads of this Chapter are these three plagues more. The Fifth
Plague. The Sixth Plague. The Seventh Plague.


1. WHereof that we may make like use, as before, let us first note, from
whence any murren of cattle does come, when we are that way punished in a
country; surely, even from the Lord, as we see here. Not simply from Witches,
and Sorcerers, set on by malicious neighbors, as we usually think: for what
can a whole Legion of Devils do to one swine, without leave granted from the
Lord? you know the place, and it ought to be thought upon. God sometimes tries
by this affliction; Job. 1. Ier. 12. 4. Deuteronomy. 28. 18. All the Cattle dyed
commu^^ter, non vni^e^saliter.
and so teach the Scriptures. Cursed shall be the increase of thy kine, and the
flock of thy sheep. The beasts and the birds are consumed for their sin,
that dwell in the land. Every way the^, it is ye Lord, and every way therefore,
we ought to seek to the Lord, and not to Witches, and Sorcerers.

2 But still the Lord spares the Israelites. True, and see the use of it.
First, God in his Justice this way more tormenteth verse. 4.
the minds of the wicked, who (for their rebellion against him) deserve all
punishment: so says the Psalm, The wicked shall see this, and consume away.
Psalm. 112. 10.
Secondly, the Lord assures his Chosen in all the world, that albeit in lesser
matters he tries them, or chasticeth them, as he does others; yet, when his
great plagues come of Judgment unto death, and destruction eternal, he will
surely make a separation, to the unspeakable Comfort of his own, and to the
eternal praise of his mercy. The words of the Prophet are plain. For a
little Esaias. 54. 7.
while have I forsaken thee, but with everlasting mercy have I had compassion
on thee, says the Lord, thy Redeemer. Again in the Psalm, if his wrath be
kindled but Psalm. 2. 10.
a little. Blessed are they that put their trust in him. Meaning, because there
is ever (as I say) a partition betwixt the Lords wrath, and his Chosen. Good
therefore is that prayer of David, ever to be in our mind, wheresoever we are.
O knit my heart unto thee, Lord, that I may fear thy name, that I may ever
cleave unto thee, ever be thine, and never be drawn away from thee by any
temptation whatsoever.

3. And the Lord appointed a time, saying, To morrow Verse 5.
the Lord shall finish this thing in this Land. So that, not only the
Judgment, and affliction which happens, is of the Lord; but the very time
also, when it shall begin, and when it shall end: before which time, no malice
of man, or Devil, can bring it, no power of any creature can take it away.
Tempus pr^fixit, vt non casu factum putent: Theodoret. q. 22. in Exodus
and vt certitudinem Diuin^ virtutis ostenderet, cui nemo potest resistere. He
appointed the time, says Theodoret, that they might not think these things
came by chance: likewise to show the certainty of Gods power, which no
creature can resist. Again, the truth of his comminations and threatenings you
see here, when it is said, So the Lord Psalm. 6.
did this thing on the morrow, and all the Cattle of Egypt died: but of the
Cattle of the children of Israel died not one. Learn therefore to tremble,
when the Lord threatens, and to fear the Event: for, as here, so ever he will
be true, unless hearty Repentance step in betwixt, and turn away his wrath
from us.

4. Then Pharaoh sent to see, and found all, as has been Verse 7.
said; yet, says the Text, the heart of Pharaoh was obstinate, and he did not
let the people go. Mark it well, and think with your self, whether any
Preacher, or Teacher can be plainer in words, than GOD was here, by works: or
whether any man can ever be made to see a truth by teaching, more evidently
and manifestly, than Pharaoh here saw this hand of God smiting Egypt, and
sparing Israel? yet, though GOD be the Teacher himself, and the matter subject
to his eyes without denial, Pharaoh still is obstinate, still the same, still
a striuer against God, and his grace. How then do we wonder, that where the
Word is preached, truth soundly and plainly taught, yet all be not reformed,
and reclaimed from their errors? Is there any fault in the Word, or Teacher?
are not things plain? how then comes this to pass? but even, as here it
did, from the fearful wrath of GOD, hardening such hearts, and closing such
eyes, that they can neither see, feel, or understand to salvation? All because
they have not a love to the truth, but are hypocrites, scorners, deriders, and
such as hear only for fashion, thinking themselves abundantly skillful, when
indeed they are most ignorant, and when as they may see the Lord (by his
Prophet) affirming, that he will look unto none, but such Esaias 66. 2.
as are poor, of a contrite spirit, and tremble at his words. That is, humble
in their own eyes, receiving the Word with reverence, hungring and thirsting
after the same, as the Spiritual food of their souls, and saying in their
hearts, as Samuel did, Speak on, Lord, thy servant hears. Surely, neither
true matter, nor plain manner will serve, unless God strike a holy stroke
within us, by his powerful Spirit, that we may be moved. Therefore, as it is
a blessing to have truth told us; so is it a double blessing, to have a soft
heart given us, moved, and yielding to the truth. Otherwise, as you see in the
Smiths shop, as many hard blows laid upon his Anuile, as upon the Iron he
works, and yet the Anuile remains all one, and the Iron turns to the
Smithes desire, because in the one there is heat, and in the other none: So in
the same Auditorie, as many proofs, and reasons are laid open to one, as to
another, and yet one moved, and not another. S. Augustine says, Non verbis
hominis fit, vt intelligatur verbum Dei, facit Deus vt intelligatis. The words
of man cannot make man understand God his word, but it is God that makes them
to understand. Joy therefore in the Lord his mercy toward you, when you have
feeling; know that it is a grace not given to all: you see Pharaoh here, and
such has the world many, whom no preaching can reform. etc.

5. Ver. 8. unto the 13. you see the sixth plague of Egypt, Verse 8. The 6.
plague. Verse. 9. 2. Antiq. ca. 13.
even a foul scab breaking out into blisters upon man, and beast. Whereof,
Josephus says, no small number died, yet could not this move them to see the
hand of God. Such ugly sores and maladies our age also has, and as far from
leading to true repentance, as these here. That grievous Disease began in
Spain; but afterward crept into France, and there so abounded, as ever since
it has carried the name of that Country, and not of Spain. Be it, that by
diverse means it may happen; as, by a cup, a comb, a stool, and such like, so
that every one is not guilty of lewd life, who happily is spotted with it;
yet, which way so ever it comes, the Lord touches, and it is ever good, to
see his hand distinguished from other causes, and to fall down before him, in
humble acknowledgement of our sin, making our peace by true submission, and
beseeching him either to remove such punishment from us, or to seal up our
hearts in the assurance of his love, notwithstanding all earthly trials. Let us
also in this place mark, how the Sorcerers were smitten with this plague, so
that they could not stand before Moses. They had seen many things before to
make them give place, the devouring of their rods, their inhabilitie to make
that base vermin (spoken of before,) yea, their own mouths then said, it was
Gods Finger; yet they will not give over their gaine-saying, and crossing of
Gods Ministers, till the Plague of God light upon their own persons, in these
ugly soars, which surely is a very effectual warning to all Kebellers
against good things, that they give over betimes, and yield to God, so avoiding
his wrathful stripes, either upon themselves, or their goods. God is the same,
as just as ever; as strong as ever; and will flesh and blood provoke him? A
better course shall be our wisdom.

6 This seventh Plague now following, ver. thirteenth, The 7. Plague.
has also his Denunciation, his Execution, and his Effect. Which in order
observed, will yield us sundry Meditations. And first, the Denunciation will
more and more beat into us the wonderful hardness of Pharaoh and his People,
who neither by any nor all the Plagues before mentioned, of Blood, of Frogs,
of Lice, of Flies, of Moraine, of Botch, could be moved, and turned to the
obedience due from man to God. Can we wonder at waywarde creatures in our
times, when we see this? No, no, the heart of man and Woman is a most
wonderful perverse thing, when God works not: and these often Repetitions
are made by Gods Spirit, that we should mark it, know it, and continually
pray against it.

7 You see God wills Moses to Rise up early in the verse. 13.
morning, and stand before Pharaoh, Let the use of it be, to teach with what
diligence and care God would ever have his business, how he hates negligence,
and loose slubbering over what belongs to our charge, saying in plain
terms; Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord negligently. Ministers
then, forasmuch as their calling is to do the work of God, and to stand
before Pharaoh; they must be diligent, zealous, careful, and painful, doing
what lies in them, ever. Magistrates also must do the like, for they execute
not the judgments of man, but of the Lord: and he will be with them in the
cause and judgment. For there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, neither
respect of persons, nor receauinge of reward. Parents, and Masters, do the
work of God, and therefore they must be diligent, calling upon their children,
and families with blessed Abraham, to fear the Lord. There be also in
Parishes Church Officers, Sworne-men, with such like; who, for their year,
have Gods work in hand, and therefore they should have a great conscience to
do their duties diligently, for fear of the curse above mentioned. But surely
their gross dulnes cries for great vengeance, and I pray God, it reach not to
their posterity also, and to all that they have gathered together for them.
For so good Offices, to so good use, both of the Church, and Commonwealth,
cannot be so wilfully and wittingly, so carelessly and presumptuouslie
neglected, as they are, but it will smart one day. When thou see a thief,
says God Psalm. 50. 18.
in the Psalm, thou runnest with him, and thou art a pertaker with the
Adulterers. When thou see a thief, that is, an evil doer any way, thou
consentest unto him; that is, either thou do as he does, or, at least, do
ouerlooke him, and conceal him, not bringing him by thine Office unto the
ordinary correction of his fault; and have been pertaker with the Adulterers,
in not presenting them, and following the presentment with zeal, until there
were Justice had. These things, says God, have thou done, and I held my
tongue, and thou thoughtest wickedly, that I Psalm. 50. 21,
am even such a one as thy self: but I will reprove thee, and set before thee
the things which thou have done. That is, I will make thee know, and the world
also shall know (by my dealings with thee) that thou have not risen up early
in the morning, as Moses did here, that is, thou have not had care, and
conscience to do the duty of thy Place zealouslie, and carefully, as thou
oughtst, for his sake whose work it is, and who has raised thee to credit
and account; for thy Prince his sake, who watches over thee for thy peace, and
is greatly abused by thee; for thy Country sake, which by thy negligence
becomes wicked and sinful, hastening to destruction most due and deserved.
Oh, consider this better, you that fear God, says the place, Psalm. 50. 22.
lest I PLVCKE YOU AWAY (or tear you in pieces) and there be none that can
deliver you.

8 Observe again the word, All, in the 14. verse. when Verse 14.
God says: I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart) meaning,
many sundry and several plagues; for God did not bring All (according to y^
Letter) diverse others following after, as the 8. 9. and 10. Plague. The use is
this, that we consider the peril of rebellious obstinacy against God: For
first he will punish it with one rod, then with another, (happily) with a
third; and if these single chastisements will not serve, then will he go to
many plagues, heaping wrath upon wrath, and woe upon woe, with a fierce hand;
yea, he will lay even All his plagues upon us at once, as he here speaks, to
our greatfall, and confusion. Add unto this proof here, those words in Deuteronomy.
But if thou will not obey the voice of Deuteronomy. 28. 15.
THE LORD THY GOD, to keep and to do all his Commandments and his
Ordinances, which I command thee this day, then all these curses (not one, or
two, but All these curses) shall come upon thee and overtake thee. Cursed shall
thou be in the town, and cursed 16 17 18.
in the field. Cursed shall thy basket be, and thy dough. Cursed shall be the
fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and
the flocks of thy Sheep. Cursed shall thou be when thou come in, 19. 2.
and cursed when thou go out. The Lord shall send upon thee cursing,
trouble, and shame in all that which thou set thine hand to do, until thou
be destroyed, and perish quickly, because of the wickedness of thy works,
whereby thou have forsaken me. Take we heed therefore, we were best, of
Pharaohs obstinacy, and disobedience against God, against his Word, and
against his Servant and messengers sent unto us, for our good; lest this
heap of curses light upon us, and even All the Lords plagues punish us. We
may note again, how he calls them his plagues, saying, all my plagues; and
learn thereby, that neither Fortune, nor Chance rules rods and crosses laid
upon us: but these things still are Gods tools, whereby he either boweth or
breaks men and women that are warped, and cast aside, being (by him) laid
on, and taken off, at his pleasure. So said our Savior to his Persecutor, thou
Math. 26.
could have no power over me, except it were given thee from above. This
well remembered, will make us see and discern God in our sickness, in our loss
of friends, or goods, in our woes, and wants whatsoever they be, and the sooner
stoop under his hand, and be turned to his will. Our hearts will say within
us, This is Gods hand, this is his blow; O soul, turn, turn, and be
reformed, thou may go no further in this way, thou may not resist him,
that is too strong for thee. Witches, Sorcerers, Thieves, Robbers, Raylers,
Slaunderers, and Oppressors whatsoever, that have done me wrong, I look not
at them, otherwise than at God his rods: for all plagues, I see in this Text,
are his plagues, and he rules all, casting these rods into the fire, when his
child is humbled, and reformed. Blessed therefore is the man that fears
always: but he that hardens his heart; shall fall into evil. Pro. 28. 14,


9. God says he will send all these plagues upon his heart, which (besides
the Note in your Bibles margin) may signify, that they should touch him
inwardly, and deeply: so does God daily, where he is angry, and so can God
do with us, if we provoke him. To smite us in arms, hands, legs, or the
like parts is grievous unto us and bitter; but when sorrow is laid upon the
heart, it stingeth indeed, and most bitterly, which He would express, that
said; Sorrow has pierced my head, showed it self at the windows, and sunk
down to my heart. Degrees of woe all bitter, but the last most of all to be
feared: for look what the moath is to the garment, and the worm to the wood;
such is the sorrow of the heart. And therefore says Solomon again, Sorrow
or heaviness in the heart of man, does bring it down: and in another place, A
sorrowful mind dries the bones: And, by the Pro. 17. 2^. and cap. 15. 13.
sorrow of the heart the mind is heavy. Poets would express as much, when
they termed sorrow and care, eating and biting. The way to prevent this
doleful sorrow of heart, laid on by an angry God, is, to take our sins to
heart betimes, and (by true repentance) to f^ie from them, which God, for his
mercy sake, grant we may do.

10. The 16. and 17. verses, to our great good, instruct verse. 16, 17.
us concerning wicked men; that indeed, as Pharaoh here, so are they
appointed of God, and they can do but what He will have them, howsoever yet
they, not considering thus much, exalt themselves against Gods people often, as
here did this Tyrant. Fear not therefore their fear, but settle this
doctrine soundly in your hearts, and leave all to God. He that raised them, for
his Will, can keep them within the limits of his Will, and that Will to us can
never be hurtful, if we dutifully commend our selves to it.

11. Thus God has given Pharaoh warning, what Judgments are hanging over his
head, ready forthwith to fall upon him, unless he yield to dismiss his
people out of Egypt. Yet see, and never forget it, whilst you live; In the
midst of all this wrath, the Lord remembers mercy: And bids them be
warned, to send for their Verse 19.
Cattle into the house, for fear of the hail, which was to come. For upon
all the men, and beasts, which were found abroad, should the hayle fall, and
they die. Why? what then? should not all this have been most just in God, they
being so rebellious sinners? It is very true, if they had all died, it had
been most just. Nevertheless, even to such sinners, the Lord would have his
mercy extended. And therefore, if ever any man or woman shall doubt of mercy
from such a God, it is a wrong, it is a sin intolerable. For, he that is
thus to Lions raging and roaring against him, can he be hard to his little
Lambs, that religiously trust in him? Shall you, and I, be cast away, when
Pharaoh is respected? No, it has not been, it shall not be, it connot be so
with the Lord. Quick is the eye of him, to see the fears of his Children,
ever, and with a tender heart he sends comfort, in his good time. Dear and
gracious Father, confirm the hearts of thy little Flock, in the sweet
assurance of this thy goodness, evermore, and in my blessed Savior, thy beloved
Son: accept the hidden thankful thoughts of my soul, for what I have found
at thy gracious hand, in mine own particular, and pardon my wants, Amen, Amen.

12 Such then as feared the word of the Lord among the servant of Pharaoh,
says the Text, made his Servants verse. 20.
and Cattle fly into the houses: But such as regarded not the 21.
word of the Lord, left his servants, and his cattle in the field. Quare
grandinem illaturus, denunciauit illis, vti pecora domu^ cogerent? Dominus cum
sit humanissimus, miserecordia temperat suppplica. Alioqui etiam nouerat
quosdam esse venia dignos, quod non tacet Scriptura Diuina. Qui enim, ait, ex
seruis Pharaonis timuit verbum domini, peccora sua domum coegit, etc. Why did
the Lord (being purposed to bring hail upon them) admonish them to fetch their
cattle into the house? Even because he, being most gentle, would temper
punishment with mercy. And again he knew there were some differing from
others, more to be respected, which the Scripture does not conceal, when it
says, So many of Pharaoh his Servants as feared the word of the Lord, fetched
their Cattle into the house, etc. As follows in Theodoret, and Saint
Agustine upon this place. Such, and so diverse is the fruit of the self same
word of God, spoken at one time, by one man, to one people. Some regard it,
and do thereafter; some neglect, and do contrary. The greatest Moses must
reckon of this, and being forewarned, be also forearmed against the disco^fort
yt follows of it. Let the people also observe, yt such only are said here to
fear the word of the Lord, as did obey it, and fetch their Cattle in,
according to it. Look therefore ever at obedience, and judge thereby of your
heart: at the least, look at ye willingness of your heart, to obey, though
humane frailety cause some imperfection. When Josiah his heart melted, 2. King.
22. 19. Act. 2. 37. Luke. 24. 32.
when those Jews hearts were pricked, and when those Travelers hearts burned in
the way to EMMAVS; then was it well, you know, with all of them: And such feeling
must ever make us well also. For there be too many that (say Moses what the
can) will fetch neither servants, nor cattle into ye house, to who^ it shall
happen, (one day) as suredly, as here it did to ye Egyptians. Uengeance shall
come down one way, or other, and light upon them, as here did thunder, and
hayle, Ver. 23. 24.
and fire, and lightning upon the despisers of Moses warning. For, with an
heard heart, says the Wiseman, it shall Sirac. 3. 27.
never be well in the end. If a condemned man should refuse his Prince his
gracious pardon, died he not justly? If a besieged City should refuse offered
aid, perished it not worthelie? So stands it with Contemners of the word,
which is a gracious pardon for all our offenses, and a saving aid to our
besieged souls. When a sick man refuses meat, we doubt of his well-doing;
but if he feed well, we hope of life. So is it with us, if we receive the
Word, or refuse the Word. For he that is of God, says our Savior, hears
Gods word; and who so will not, as sure a sign it is, on the other side. For
you therefore hear not, because ye are not of GOD. A fish fresh and sweet is
known by the ear being fresh and sweet; and so is ever a good Christian.
Search then your self by this Rule, and you shall profit either to prayer, for
what you miss; or to thanksgiving, for what you find. In the eye of Christ,
it was so blessed a thing to hear and obey the word, Luke. 11. 28.
that he pronounced happiness rather to such, than to the womb that bare him,
and the paps that gave him suck. A moving speech, if we have any life in us.

13. Then Moses stretched out his rod toward Heaven, ver. 23.
and the Lord sent thunder, and hayle, and lightning, upon the ground: and the
Lord caused hayle to rain upon the land of Egypt. So there was hayle, and
fire mingled with the hayle, so grievous as there was none throughout all the
land of Egypt, since it was a Nation. Of which strange Plague many things are
written, which I will cut off, seeking only to make some profitable use unto
us of it. Grandinem and fulgura immisit illis, ostendens, quod ipse Theoderet
in Exodus 9.
sit Dominus omnium elementorum. Et enim tam Aegyptij, qua^ Graeci existimabant
quosda^ Deos esse coelestes, alios subterraneos. Et hos quide^ imperare terrae,
illos vero mari; and alios in montes, alios in agros imperiu^ habere.
Quapropter, etiam Syrus dicebat, Deus m^ntiu^ Deus Israel, and non conualliu^.
Ob id meri to Deus omniu^, non solu^ per fluuiu^, and terram, sed per aerem,
and mare, castigauit eos: and flumina coelitus illis immisit; doce^s, quod
ipsesit Dominus and Creator omnium, quod and beatus Moses dixit, vt cognoscas,
quod Domini sit terra, and tu, and serui tui. He sent upon them, Hayle and
Lightning, to show that he was Lord of all the elements. For both the Egyptians
and Graecians had a conceit, that there were some Gods of the Heavens, some of
the earth, and some under the earth; that one sort rules the Earth, an other
sort the Sea; one sort the Mountains, another sort the fields. Wherefore, that
Syrian said, the God of Israel is the God of mountains, and not of valleys.
Wherefore God rightly here chastised the^ not only by the Waters, and the
Earth, but by the Air also, and the Sea: and sent Thunder and Lightning from
Heaven upon them; that so he might teach, and show, that he is Lord and Creator
of all things. Which blessed Moses said in those words to Pharaoh, that thou
might know, how the Earth, and Thou, and thy Servants, are in the Lords
power. Let it make us soundly settle in our hearts, ever, both what here we
see, and what other Scriptures testify of Him. He raineth down snares, fire,
brimstone, storm, and tempest, And, it is the Lord that commands Psalm. 11.
6. Psalm. 29. 3.
the waters, it is the glorious God that makes the thunder. Fire and hayle,
snow and vapors, wind and Psalm. 148. 8.
storm fulfill his word. Whether therefore we be hindered, or furthered by
weather, let us ever cast up our eyes to Heaven: for it is the Lord still, that
rules these things, and by his Will they come, and go. Nature is His servant,
and the Devil is His rod; neither of them working, but as he appoints. The
very Heathens had a glimpse of this truth, when they taught Aeolus to be God of
the wind, and Neptune God of the Sea; supposing, that by some God these things
must be governed. Think then of the year 1588. and pour out his praise, that
so governed these things for our comfort. On the other side, when so ever they
shall cross our affairs, either by Sea, or Land, stoop we to Him in
humility, search out our ways, what we know amiss, and amend it speedily,
that the Lord may rebuke both wind, and sea for our profit. Furthermore in
this, that the Lord sent this plague of thunder and lightning upon the
Egyptians, let us learn, how he comes not stealing, to wrath and judgment
against rebellious sinners, but rattling and shaking both Heaven and Earth. The
fruit whereof should be, to make us fear to offend. For, I will make the
ears of whosoever hears to tingle, says the Lord, at that which I will do:
Ier. 19. 3.
so noting a fierce, and fearful public proceeding against sin, and
sinners, as it were upon Stages, and house tops, not in darkness and in secret.
Again, fire was mingled with hayle, to teach, that his Judgments shall not
be single, but even one upon the neck of another, until we be either
humbled, or destroyed, according unto his will. One Example of many, that are
in Gods Book, and other Histories, may suffice. Haman, that wicked enemy of
the Church, and true Religion, was at length to taste of Gods Justice for his
sins: and how comes the Lord against him? closely and covertly? No, but
even with thunder, and lightning, as here, against Pharaoh: that is, with
open, and great show, to all men, of his wrath. For first, he is made to lead
his horse, in honor of him, whom of all men he most maliced: secondly, he
falls justly into his Princes heavy indignation, and when he humbly sued
at the Queens feet for pardon, he was taken by the King, as intending high
villainy, which increased the Kings wrath mightily: thirdly, he is dispatched
away, to be hanged upon that Gallows, which (in his greatness) he had prepared
for another: fourthly, his house and Land, his honor, and offices were all
given away, where he least wished them; and yet the Lord stayed not here, but
fearfully destroyed also his posterity. Was not this thundering? was not this
lightning? and was not this Judgment, as upon a stage? O let it ever be
remembered of all that read it with their eyes; and God, for his mercy sake,
make it profitable.

14 Only in the land of Goshen (where the children of verse. 26.
Israel were) was no hayle. In which words, as heretofore, so still still is
noted the unsearchable goodness of God to his Church, together with his
Almighty power, to do ever what He will. He can save, and He can spill; He can
make such a wall about his children, that no storm, or tempest, no calamity,
or evil shall come nere them, though it compass them round about, and others
perish with it, on every side. Two shall be in the field, the one received,
the other forsaken; two shall be grinding at the mill, the one accepted, the
other rejected, etc. Blessed therefore is that man and woman, who have the Lord
for their God; And say unto my soul, I am thy salvation, says David, in one
of his Psalms: noting thereby the comfort of this, above ten thousand worlds.
Let us therefore ever be careful to be of the number of those, that abide in
Goshen, where the Saving hand of God shall defend from al evil.

15. In these smooth words of Pharaoh, verse. 27. (That he had sinned, that
the Lord was righteous, and he, verse. 27.
and his people wicked; That Moses should pray for him, etc. returning
nevertheless to his old byas when the Plague was gone;) still observe (as you
have done before) the deep falsehood of man's heart, making fair shows without
fruit; and if God be thus glozed and dissembled with all, think, whether it
seem strange to mortal man, to taste of it? No, no, we must reckon of it, to
be praised to our face, to be sclaundered at our backs, by the one and the
same person. Yet let it not discourage us to do any good, but only let it
make us careful, to give no just cause, and ten thousand times thankful,
when we are released out of such a world, and taken into his kingdom.

16. Lastly, that often repeated Sentence of Pharaohs heardened heart, let it
remember us of that Saying in Saint Augustine, Corda mala, patientia Dei,
durescunt. Evil hearts wax-heard by Gods long-suffering and patience. Also, of
that in Saint Bernard, Cor durum dici, quod non co^pu^ctione scinditur, nec
pietate mollitur, nec mouetur precibus, minis non cedit, flagellis duratur,
ingratum ad beneficia, ad consilia infidum, ad iudicia saeuum, inuerecundum ad
turpia, impauidum ad pericula, inhumanum ad humana, temerarium ad Diuina,
preteritorum obliuiscens, praesentium negligens, and futura non praeuidens. It
is called a heard heart, which is neither rent with compunction, nor softened
with piety, nor moved with prayers, which gives no place to threatenings, is
hardened with stripes, in benefits unthankful, in Council unfaithful, in
judgment cruel, unshamefast in foul things, not fearful in perils, in
humane things most inhumane, in Divine things rash, forgetting things past,
neglecting things present, and not foreseeing things to come. Surely such a
description (if we our selves have not Pharaohs hardness) will ever move us,
earnestly to pray against such hardness. Thus ends this Chapter, and thus
end I, having given you some taste, how we may profit by reading of it.

CHAP. 10.
Here you have following two Plagues more, to wit, the eight, and the ninth.
The eight, from the beginning of the Chapter, to the twenty verse: and the
ninth from thence to the end. Concerning the former, the Holy Ghost lays
down. 1. A Commandment to Moses to go. 2. A Denunciation. 3. An Execution.
4. The Effect, and that in the Servants. King.



1. TOuching the first, the Text says, Verse. 1.
Again the Lord said unto Moses, go to Pharaoh, etc. Diverse times, you know,
he had sent before, and all in vain; yet cease not the bottomless and
incomprehensible mercy of God, still, still, again and again to send. This
was ever his gracious dealing with miserable sinners, and a sweet comfort it
is to a troubled mind to think of it. The Gospel says in like sort, He
sentagaine Luke. 20. 9. etc.
and again, other and other servants to those wicked husbandmen, to remember
them of his due, and their duty; At last he sent his own Son unto them,
saying, they will reverence my Son. Again, to Jerusalem, Luke. 13. 34.
how often, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a
Hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and yet would not? O tender Father!
what a certain Seal is this thy goodness in these examples, that true
Repentance shall never be rejected, A sorrowful sinner never repulsed, a
broken and contrite heart never despised? Let it profit us unto increase of
faith, for his sake that dyed for our sins. Our own experience has taught
us as much, if we did observe it. For how long have we been sinners? have
not some of us been 20 years, some 30, some 40, and more (all of us too long)
walking the way, that leads unto death? And what have our sins been?
surely great, foul, ugly, odious to God, dangerous to our selves, and
offensive to the world: yet has the Lord neither swept us away in his most
just wrath, neither ceased to send Moses again and again unto us, for our
reformation. Should not this infinite goodness much move us, to return to so
sweet a Father? Know Romans 2. 4.
thou not (O man) says the blessed Apostle, that the long suffering of God
leads thee to repentance? How entertained he the Prodigal Son when he
returned? how rejoice the Angels in Heaven, over one sinner, that repents?
far be it ever then from us, ever to resist a God so powerful to confound us,
and so merciful to receive us.

2. But the Lord says here, that he hardened Pharaohs heart, and the hearts
of his servants, how then was the fault in them, that they yielded not? for
answer, let me ask you another question: whether you think it not lawful,
that God should punish a sinner, as himself likes? and whether hardness of
heart be not a punishment? if both be true, then might the Lord punish him this
way. Yet all men do not think this such a punishment as it is; for, if we be
sick, we look for help, if the eye fail, the ear grow dull, or any sense
be weakened, we quickly feel it, and readily with for remedy; only, if our
heart grow dull, and our understanding, feeling, and profiting in Gods School
be taken from us, we are not moved, neither think it goes ill with us,
preferring the outward sense of body far and far before the light of the mind.
But let it be lawful, you say, with the Lord thus to punish; yet it must
needs excuse the party so punished: for, how can a man feel, and relent,
whose heart God smites with hardness? no, it excuses not, because a man may
sin necessarily, and yet not constrainedly, but willingly; which consent
Necessario, non coacte.
of will makes him guilty: as in common experience, you see one in a great
heat drink necessarily, in respect of heat; yet not constrainedly, but very
willingly. Look not therefore at Gods secret Decree, but at man's willing
approbation of what is evil. And in this matter remember the modesty, and
reverence of S. Paul, when he says; O man, who art thou that pleadest with
God? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why have thou Romans 9.
20. etc.
made me thus? etc. O the deepenes of the riches, both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God! how unsearchable Romans 11. 33.
are his Judgments, and his ways past finding out! Remember also how S.
Augustine imitateth him in this virtue, saying, O man, thou look for an
answer of me, and I also am a man my self; therefore let us both hear him
that says, Who art thou that disputest with GOD? Better is holy ignorance,
than rash knowledge, Melior est fidelis ignorantia, quam temeraria scientia.
Seek thou for merit, thou shall find but punishment. O deepenes! reason
thou, I will marvel; dispute thou, I will believe: and he that likes not of
this answer, let him seek one more learned, but take heed, he find not one
more presuming.

3. That thou may declare in the ears of thy son, and thy sons son,
what things I have done in Egypt; Ver. 2.
etc. A Notable place to teach us, as the end of Gods works and wonders, so
the duty and office of all Christian Parents and Governors: even to teach
their Children and Charge, carefully and zealouslie by them, and in them to
know the Lord. The like place you have again, in Deuteronomie. These words,
which I command Deuteronomy. 6. 6 7.
thee this day, shall be in thine heart. And thou shall rehearse them
continually unto thy children, and shall talk of them when thoutariest in
thine house, and as thou walk by the way, and when thou lie down, and
when thou risest up: etc. Thus is God himself the Author of that Catechizing
and instructing of youth, in his holy fear, and true Religion, which so much
is neglected in our days, and whereunto not only youth (who know not their
own good) are hardly drawn; but even their elder Parents and Masters are
very unwilling to have them drawn. But can the stubborn and headstrong
contempt of so holy a Commandment of him that made us be ever unpunished? no,
no, it both has, and ever shall have his due correction, both in those that
should come, and those that should send them, and see them come, Parents,
Masters, Godfathers, and Godmothers, and the like. Hence it comes, that
children are often disobedient to their Parents, wanton, wilful, wicked, and
in the end die a shameful death. Parents can get for their Sons the
Landlords Cloth, thereby to have countenance and aid in the world; but they
never cast, nor care to get them Gods holy fear in their hearts, who is
Landlord of all Lands, and Lords, thereby to have both the promise of this
life, and of that to come. O blindness! do we not see, how great, and how
foul, how gross, and how sinful? if we do, let us hereafter amend this
fault, and assure our selves, that all the countenance in the world is not like
his favor, that made both our posterity, and the world; rules them, and the
world; destroys them, and the world. Wherefore he promised it to Abraham, as
a thing above all the riches of the world, that he would be his God, and the
God of his seed, if he walked before him in vprightnes. Follow this Meditation
further in your own mind, and you shall find it work to a careful course,
touching such as are committed to you.

4. How long will thou refuse to humble thy self before verse. 3.
me? These words tell us the drift of all crosses and afflictions in this
life; even to bring down the swelling pride of our sinful hearts: that
yielding God what is due to him, we again from him might reap mercy and
goodness more and more, to our endless comfort: for he would (...) the
contrary) of the Story in Genesis; where, for ten righteous, Genesis 18. 32.
if they could have been found, the whole City had been saved. Houses and
whole kingdoms have been favored for one righteous man dwelling therein,
proofs are many both in Scripture and all Stories, Joseph, Daniel, and such
like.

7 This speech of Pharaohs servants prevailed so far, that Moses and Aaron
were sent for to Pharaoh, and had Verse 8.
an offer made them, to depart, if they would, with some company, but not with
all: unto which Moses answered, that they must needs all go, Young and old,
Sons and Daughters, sheep and cattle, orels none. Wherein I profit thus, by
the grant of Pharaoh of some to go, and not all; I observe the malice of
Satan, and his members, against the Church and the true service of God: if they
cannot wholly destroy it, hurt it, and hinder it; then in part as far as they
can, they will do it, ever valuing much, but a little gain herein. By the
answer of Moses, I observe again, on the other side, that we must not yield
an inch to these plottes and fetches of the wicked, but zealously must stand
upon the full observance of all Gods Will, according to his commandment, and
not according to the fancies either of others, or of our selves. Where the Lord
dispenses not, we must not dispense; where al are bound to depart out of
Egypt, we must not capitulate, for some to go, and some to tarry. Whereof,
would God, men in our dais had due consideration: where the Husband goes to
Church, but not the wife; the Father, but not the Son; the Servant, but not
the Master: Moses would not do thus, in this place, but (knowing all to be
bound) requires all; leaving us therein a fearful assurance, that this
playing at half stake with the Lord, as it is most odious to him, so most
dreadfully by him it will one day be punished.

8. The words following in the eleventh verse. are not to be passed over
without some profit, Then they were Verse. 11.
thrust out from Pharaohs presence; For they notably show the too common
entertainment of Gods messengers in this wicked world: namely, to be thrust
out, and very unkindly entreated without any fault. So were the Prophets and
Apostles in their times; yea, the great Master himself, when they forcibly
carried him toward the top of a mountain with a purpose violently to have cast
him down. But let it comfort us, and shake the hearts of such wicked wretches
ever, that the very dust of our feet shall be a witness for us against them
in the great day of just judgment, and due revenge for such sin. He that
receaueth you receaueth me; and he that refuses, (and thrusts you out)
refuses, (and thrusts me out.) Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.

9 By occasion of these Grasshoppers, sent in the wrath Verse. 15. The 8. Plague.
of God, as a Plague to annoy the Egyptians, covering All the face of the earth
(by their multitude) till the land was dark with them, and eating up all the
herbs of the land, with the fruits of the trees, etc. You may take occasion
to remember what you read of Grasshoppers in the Scriptures; and you may hear
also what others have said of them. First, you find in Leuiticus a kind of
Grasshopper Leuit. 11. 22.
among the clean beasts, which the Israelites might eat of: whereunto refer
that in Matthew of John Baptist, Matthew. 3. 4.
how his meat was Locusts, that is, Grasshoppers, and wild honey. This kind of
Grasshopper, to us, at this dale, is not well known, as neither to others
before our time. For Theophilact upon Math, supposes John's Locusts to have
been herbs so called, and Euthimius upon Math, Certain wild fruits, such
as the wilderness, wherein John lived, yielded unto him. Chrysostom and
Athanasius before him were of the same opinion, says Hermolaus Barbarus. But
Saint Hillary thinks they were Animalia quaedam apta ad comedendum, Certain
living creatures good for meat. Thomas Aquinas upon Matthew has the same
words. Albertus Magnus upon Math, That they were not our usual Grasshoppers;
for they (says he) are venomous: but they were certain Birds in the
Wilderness, which upon similitude of their leaping and hopping (rather than
flying) were called Grasshoppers. Pliny in his Natural History writes, that
Grasshoppers or Locusts to the Parthians, were most acceptable meat: again, in
another place, yt a part of Aethiopia lives only by Locusts made hard by
smoke and salt. But they Fumo and sale duratis.
live not, says he, above 40. years. S. Hierome says, that the Eastern
people and Enhabitants of Libya eat much these Grasshoppers: because in the
Desert, and hot vastnes of the Wilderness, there are found clouds of them.
Pliny Nubes Locustarum.
again writes of them, that there are of 3. foot long in India. The word
also, Locusta, we know, is sometimes taken for the fish which we call a
Lobster. In the Apocalypse you read, that the bottomless pit was opened, and
Apoc. 9. 2.
out of the same arose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. And out of
the smoke came Locusts (or Grasshoppers,) upon the earth, etc. Where you may
consider 3.
what is meant by these Locusts, and then the reason of their resemblance.
These Locusts prefigured and foretold to the Church of God all that rabble of
the Popish Clergy, which afterward, in time, covered (as it were) the face of
the earth, their Priests, their swarms of Monks, Friars, Nuns, and other
Orders, almost without number. For here is mention made of a Star that fell;
now Stars (in this book) do signify the Angels of the Churches, Apoc. 9.
1.
who shine by the light of Heavenly doctrine, and holy life, as stars in the
firmament by their brightness; and who truly may be said to stand, whilst they
do their duties; and to fall from Heaven, when (forgetting life, and doctrine)
they think, speak, and follow earthly things. The Star therefore, that is
here said to fall from Heaven unto the earth, was some great Minister in the
Church, of such authority, and high estimation, as the power ascribed unto him
plainly teaches. But who, in all the world, can be named such a One, saving
the Bishop of Rome? for, by all Stories we see, and know, that they were
excellent men, at the beginning, many of them, yea unto Constantine the Great,
as I remember, 32 succeeded one after another, good, and learned men; holy, and
reverend Martyrs, for the self same truth, which we at this day hold, and
their Successors have forsaken. From Constantine again to Gregory the Great
about 32 more, good men, though not altogether as the former. For even now
began some declination in the Church, yet not such, but that Gregory detested
the proud Supremacy, which now is challenged, and told the Bishop of
Constantinople (then ambitiouslie seeking for it,) that whosoever sought to be
called Universal Bishop was (out of question) the Forerunner of Antichrist.
But, when Boniface the Third came, he little passing for Gregory his opinion,
obtained of Phocas, (that bloody Traitor, who had killed the Emperor his
Master, his Wife, and Children, and so got to be Emperor) that Rome might
be the Head of all Cities, and the Bishop there, universal Bishop over all.
Here then fell the Star from Heaven to Earth, when it left Heaven, and claue
to the Earth, hunting continually for earthly honor since that day, and
plotting earthly trouble to all Nations. The brightness of Doctrine, and holy
life, which former Bishops of Rome had, and thereby did shine as stars, was
now lost: and all idle inventions of man's sinful brain brought in to worship
God with them, in stead of his own Commandments. Great power to hurt
retained, having not now Peter's keys (as they boast,) but the keys of the
bottomless pit given them, to bring out thence into the Church Doctrines of
Devils, 1. Timoth. 4. 1. 2. 3.
darkness, ignorance, superstition, and all wicked abominations, like soul
thick smoke hiding the brightness and light of Christ our Savior from the
eyes of men, even so strongly, that such smoke is resembled to the smoke of a
great furnace, for the strength of it. What gross lies, what palpable Fables,
have their Legends, their elder Masse-Bookes, and Primers, printed long since?
surely even such, as themselves, at this day, are ashamed of, and leave out of
their new Books. Then out of this filthy foggie smoke ascending out of the
pit, when it was opened, came the swarms of Locusts mentioned, Monks, Friars,
etc. No Papist in the world can show where (under any Star fallen) there is
such a resemblance as under their Pope has been, and is at this day still:
which being the second point I prayed you to mark, now cast your eyes upon it,
and mark it much. First, Grasshoppers do most of their hurt by their mouths;
and so does Romish Lucusts by their cursed speaking; teaching, charming, and
alluring Christian people from GOD, from Prince, and Country, to their
damnable opinions, and resolutions. This Speech of their mouths makes me
remember S. Bernards Speech, Bestia illa cui datum est es loqu^ens blasphemias,
and bellum gevere cum sanctis, Petri cathedram occupat tanquam Leo paratus ad
praedam. That beast unto which there is given a mouth to speak blasphemies,
and to war with the Saints, possesses the Chair of Peter, as a Lion
prepared to his pray. A great Speech in those days, if you mark it.

Secondly, Grasshoppers use to swarm in great abundance, whereupon came the
Proverb, As thick, as Grasshoppers. So these Romish Locusts did they not
ouer-spread (as it were) the whole earth, when under Pope Pius the 2, one order
of Friars (called Minorits) so abounded, and swarmed, that the Master of the
Order offered the Pope, either against the Turk, or for any other service,
thirty Thousand able fighting men, and yet would leave so many more? What
Swarms, think you, were amongst all the Orders, if one were so great? very
fitly therefore did the Similitude of Locusts foretell this rabble, in time, to
come into the world.

Thirdly, Grasshoppers do eate-vp and destroy all green things, and fruits of
the earth: And even so these Antichristian Joel. 2.
Locusts, Swarms of Romish Friars, and such like, left not a green thing
vndeuoured, that is, not a good soil, and seat in any Land, wherein they
clapped not down themselves, had a house built, and possessed the pleasure, and
profit thereof, till God (in mercy to his Church) sent a strong wind, and blew
them away.

Fourthly, Grasshoppers are said, and written of, to be insatiable, ever hungry,
whilst they live; Locusta enim quasi tota vena est, and ideo insatiabilis;
quam diu viuit, semper esurit. And were not the Romish Locusts so to (I pray
you) in their time, and yet still are, where they have place? The world, with
many woeful complaints, has left their insatiable devouring testified to all
posterity.

Fifthly, one Grasshopper, alone, is very contemptible, and no man fears him,
but (in Swarms) they are as terrible, on the other side, to a whole Land. Even
so Romish Locusts, Priests, Friars, and such like, one of any sort, alone,
without dread; but beware heaps and Swarms of them, for by their multitude
they have dared, and wronged great Princes.

Sixthly, the Grasshoppers leap, and sing, and play all Summer long: so did
these rabble plentifully take their pleasure all the time of their Summer,
lived in idleness, upon other men's labors, singing, and saying; sporting, and
playing; and who durst say, nay?

Lastly, Locusta est animal paruulum, inter volatile and reptile medium, pestis
tanta, vt ab Ethnicis Deorum ira dicatur. The Grasshopper, says Chrysostom,
neither properly flying, nor creeping, but (as it were) a middle thing betwixt
both, such a plague, that the Heathens have called it, The wrath of God. So
write the Papists or Romish Locusts of their Head the Pope, that he is neither
merely a man, nor absolutely, a God; but a middle creature betwixt both: and
then we dare add, that he is such a plague, as truly we may term, The wrath
of God.

Thus might I go forward in this resemblance, and show you how fitly the holy
Spirit of God foretold of these swarms, under the name of Locustes: but this
much shows you the way, and you your self may think of mo agreements.

Now mark you the words in the Revelation: and as, by this which I have
said, you have seen, how like the Popish Clergy is to Grasshoppers in some
conditions; so (there) shall you see, how like they are to the description of
Locustes, (there) made by Saint John; that every way you may be sure, the
Prophecy in the Apocalips noted out these creatures.

First it is said, unto them was given power, as the Scorpions of the earth
have power. Now we read, that the Apoc. 9. 3.
Scorpion is a flattering beast, and in the midst of his flattery with the
sting of his tail wounds to death. So were and are these Popish Locustes
ever full of flattery, and fawning, and in the midst thereof full of poison,
striking to death (with their stings of false Doctrine,) as many as they can
fasten the same in. Again, the Scorpions sting (at the first) makes no great
pain, but (after it has crept abroad, and dispersed his venom in the body)
it kills most cruelly, and without remedy; so the stinging persuasions of
Romish Locustes appear not (at first) so dangerous: but (when they have gotten
strength) the party hardly ever recouereth. The Doctrine of Free justification
in the blood of Christ is hid from Gods people, and condemned as heresy. All
assurance of Gods favor, all peace of conscience, all joy in the Holy Ghost,
quite destroyed. Men are sent to seek ease in the Merit of their own works,
in Popes Pardons, and Indulgences, in running on pilgrimage to this Idol, and
that; in punishing their bodies by fastings, whippings, and such like
inventions; and yet are they not eased hereby, but torments of conscience (as
the venom of these Scorpion-like Locustes, which have stinged them still)
remain bitter, and heavy upon them. Then must they build Abbeies, give money
for Trentals of Masses; then sing, sing, ring, ring, cast Pardons into the
grave, call for the poor, give alms, and what not? Judge now if this kind of
power of these Locustes be not as the power of Scorpions upon earth, as Saint
John speaks: and be you most assured, that God pointed at them in this
Prophetic, that we might be forewarned, and so forearmed against them.

Secondly, it is said in the Apocalypse, how to those Apoc. 9. 4.
Locustes was commanded that they should not hurt the grass of the earth,
neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men which have not
the Scale of God in their fore-heades. And how fitly agrees this to the Romish
Locustes? For there be in the world two sorts of people; one, that wittingly
and willingly will run after their own woe, and are bitter professed (...)ies
of the Truth, whom God in his Justice, has rejected and not scaled: yt other
sort, is of them which (not maliciously, but of mere ignorance) go awrie,
being desirous to do well, yet in their simplicity deceived, and abused by
crafty Juglers. The former sort only are those, whom these Locustes can hurt.
The latter (in Gods infinite goodness) is exempt, as green things which he
will not have harmed, and as persons sealed in their foreheades, which ye
former wanted. A sweet Testimony of the power and mercy of our most gracious
Father, who in the very midst of darkness, and even when Antichrist is at
his height can preserve his chosen from any hurt by those swarms of Locustes,
which have great power given them to hurt others. The observing whereof much
does enable us to answer that scale objection, Where was your Church before
Luther. Surely in the midst of these Locustes, Scorpions and Hornets, yet by
the power of an Almighty God preserved from hurt, as you see here, these
green things were. But you may think, how can this be? Are all those whom
these Romish Locustes sting with any false and erroneous opinion, cast away and
damned? this were hard; and if not, how then is it said, that they shall not
have power to hurt the Elect? The next verse in the Revelation answers the
matter: where (lest any should mistake the word Apoc 9. 5.
of hurting,) the holy Ghost shows what he means by it; namely, that they
should not kill the Elect, but only such as were not sealed. Hurt then the
Elect may be, or (as it is there) vexed five months, and their pain shall be
as the pain that comes of a Scorpion, which has stung a man, but killed
they shall not be: that is, finally ouer-throwne and cast away touching
eternal life. Grasshoppers come in April, and live till September; five
months, and then are gone: so may the Elect be afflicted for a time, and hurt
in their goods, and bodies, and friends, as Job was, but September will come,
when the Locusts shall away, and their Deliverance be wrought by a gracious
GOD. Thus comforted Paul the Church in his time, saying, As Iannes and Iambres
withstoode Moses, so do these also resist the truth. But (now mark) they
shall prevail no ^. Tim. 3. 8.
longer: for their madness shall be evident unto all men as theirs also was. An
end therefore will be of all troubles, which these Locusts shall work unto the
Church and Elect of God. Five months is not long (in respect of that eternity
which follows;) and therefore in comfort be we patient: their time is set,
and they shall have an end. Again, this place may notably assure you, and
every one, that all which died in the time of Popery, were not castaway, but
that at one time, or other, by one way, or other, the Lord gave them light, and
a holy departure in his truth: and Stories tell us how still (in the time of
darkness) God raised up some zealous, and able Teachers of their brethren, by
whose ministry and help many received light, and overcame the power of
error. Whereunto agree the words of Primatius, Illi hic intelliguntur, qui,
licet falsis fuerunt irretiti doctrinis, circa finem tamen vitae compuncti,
diuinam recipient veritatem. They here are understood, who, though they have
been abused by false Doctrine, yet in the end of their life having remorse,
they entertained the Heavenly truth. The words following, (that, in those days
men shall seek death, and shall not find it, Apoc 9. 6.
and shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them,) very effectually
show forth the tortures of conscience, which Popish Doctrine casts men into,
so well known by fearful Examples, as I need not to stand upon it. Also the
mysteries of the Time wherein the Locusts should swarm, fully expressed in
Stories, which indeed made many a man and woman weary of life. The little
short time of Queen Marie her Reign, how full it was of vexation, and grief,
is not, nor cannot be forgotten.

Thirdly, in the place of the Revelation it is said, The Apoc. 9 7.
form of the Locusts was like unto horses prepared unto battle. And see how
it resembles Romish Locusts. Horses are proud, so are they; Horses are bold,
and sturdie, fierce, and cruel, not turning back, but rushing forward; so are
they bold, and bloody, sturdie, and merciless, not looking back by
repentance, but rushing forward in hardness of heart. Horses are fat, and fair,
and full of neighing; so are they. And for being prepared to battle, all
Histories show, what wars they have caused, and still do, in the world;
themselves being Leaders, Captains, and Generals in them: whereas we know,
that the true Church of God (by the Rule and Example of the Gospel) ought to
be a Daughter of peace, not a Mother of debate; A forgiuer of injuries, not a
renenger of her self, or a seeker of wars. The Tragical Story betwixt
Frederick the 2, and Gregory the 9, may serve (in stead of many) to prove,
what wars and treacheries come from Rome. That horrible slaughter betwixt
both sides of thirty thousand Math. Paris. page 92.
(the most Citizens of Rome) whom will it not move, that reads it? This Pope
was in the days of Henry the 3, King of England. The open wars proclaimed
against the Greek Church, show much. But I will lay down the very words of
Pandolphus, who wrote, in Italian, the life of this Frederick the 2, that such
as have not the Story, may see this point fully; and, I pray you, mark them
well. Truly, says He, when I consider with my self, that Christ (whose Vicar
the Roman Bishops boast themselves Pandolphus his words.
to be) said unto his Disciples, that they should follow him, and imitate his
Example, as of their Master and Teacher; and commanded them farther, that
they should not draw the sword, but put the same into the scabbard; and gave
them in precept, that they should not only forgive injuries 7. times, but 70.
times 7. times, to those that offended them: And, when I now compare the lives
of the Bishops of Rome, how near they follow him, whose Vicars (they say) they
are; and consider so many, and so great conspiracies, treasons, rebellions,
disloyalties, lyings in wait, and treacherous devises; so many Legates of the
Popes, (being Ecclesiastical persons, which will needs be called the
Sheepheards of Christ his Flock) to be such Warriors and Captains of
Soldiers in all the parts of Italy, Campania, Apulia, Calabria, (being the
Emperors Dominions,) in Picenum, Aemilia, Flaminia, and Lumbardie, to be sent
against him; Also, when with my self I meditate the destruction of so many
great and famous Cities, the subversion of such Co^mon-weales, the slaughter of
so many men, and the effusion of such Christian blood; Lastly, when I behold so
victorious, prosperous, and fortunate Emperors to be, and so many miserable,
unfortunate, and vanquished Popes to be put to flight; I am persuaded with my
self to think and believe, that the Judgments of God are secret, and
marvelous, and That to be true that Aeneas Siluius writes in his History of
Austria; That there is no great and marvelous clade, no notorious and special
calamity (that has happened either to the Publique-weale, or else to the Church
of GOD) whereof the Bishops of Rome have not been the Authors. Add unto this
that Notable place in the Prophet Micah, where speaking of Gods true Church, it
is said, they shall break their swords into Mattocks, and their Micah. 4. 3.
spears into ^ithes, that is, their fierce affections shall (by the power of
the word) be mortified, and brotherly love increased, with desire of peace and
quietness. But these men (even contrary) break their Mattocks into swords, and
their ^ithes into spears, being so great, so fierce, so ambitions, and common
Warriors, as they are. The strange cruelties of Urban the 5. making bloody,
and great wars upon many, and bringing them, by force, in subjection to him,
I omit. These things show, how truly this Prophecy of the Apocalypse,
(concerning Locusts like unto horses prepared to battle) agrees to these
Romish Locusts, Popes, Cardinals, Legates, Monks, Friars, Priests, Jesuits,
and such like. Nicholas Machiauel says, all the ruinous calamities and
miserable clades, that either Italy, or whole Christendom has suffered, have
been brought in by the Popes of Rome. A fair warning to all Gods people, to
know them, and avoid them.

Fourthly, on their heads (were as it were) crowns like Apoc. 9. 7.
unto gold, And these have Shaven Crowns tokens (as they say) of their
Priestly and Kingly dignity. Such Crowns are rightly said by S. John to be
like Crowns, not Crowns indeed. Surely, right Notes they are of Romish
Locusts, and that may suffice as many as will be warned by any thing.

Fifthly, And their faces were like the faces of men. So Apoc. 9. 7.
are these; not terrible in show, but courteous, kind, fawning, flattering,
watching, catching with smooth wiles to effect their purpose. They pretend all
good, making men believe, that they can bring them to true Blessedness, that
they will teach them true Religion, true Devotion, and give them Pardon for all
sins. So in Daniel is it said, that to Antichrist are given the eyes of a
man, still therefore Daniel. 7. 8.
mark how these properties hit.

Sixthly, Their hair as the hair of women. So are Apoc. 9. 8.
these; they are delicious, and wanton, full of light allurements, so trick and
trim in silk and suits of their fashion, that the very Persians may seem to
give place unto them, when they are in their Pontificalibus, and gay attire. In
a word, nothing may be said more truly than that their See Aug in Apoc.
hair is like the hair of women. Their loose life has to^ much proof.

Seauenthly, But their teeth were as the teeth of Lions. Apoc. 9. 8.
So are these; passing cruel, and beyond all the butchering Tyrants that
Stories speak of. No mercy, no bowels, no respect of age, se^e, or
circumstance, usually respected of men that have any remnants of pity. Their
Inquisition, (Oh how merciless? their new devised Torments, (Oh) how strange?
Again, their teeth may be well said to be like Lions, because they devoured,
and eat up such great things. Look upon their Abbeys, Priories, Nunries, and
all Religious Houses; judge what teeth they had, and when there was not enough
to satisfy them (of temporal Lands,) then they preyed upon the Church, making
Impropriations, the venom whereof remains yet. So that one way, or other,
they were planted and placed, seated and settled in the very fat of the earth:
and had they continued still, and not been limited to five months, who? or
what should have escaped their Lyon-like teeth?

Eighthly, They had Habbergions, like to Habbergions of iron. And ^o have these,
if you well mark them: for, Apoc 9. 9.
by these iron Brest-plates are noted two properties, found in the Romish
rabble. First, a most obstinate stubbornness and inflexible frowardness, not
enduring any persuasion, not yielding any way, but crying ever, The Church, The
Church, I am settled, I am resolved, and, as a Captain of theirs (an English
Apostata) said once; Heave at us whilst you will, and whilst you may, you
shall never remove us. This is to have an Habbergion, or Breast Plate of iron,
or, even to be turned into iron. Blessed be God, who has thus foretold us of
this striffe con^umacie of theirs, to the end we should take no offense, that
they are not converted unto the Truth, but stand, and die in their wilfulnes.
Secondly, they are defended by that Antichristian power, as it were, by an
Habbergion of iron, claiming an impunitie, and immunitie from all secular power
and authority, and having (in readiness) curses and threats of Excommunication,
even against the Greatest Princes, and against All their Subjects, who shall
obey them; whereof many a woeful Tragedy has followed. Again, themselves
(many of them) have been Princes younger Sons, Noble-mens younger sons,
greatly allied and friended, so that (in regard of this power and strength)
they might truly be said to have Habbergions of iron.

Ninthly, The sound of their wings was like the sound of Chariots when many
horses run unto battle. So Apoc. 9. 9.
have these wings, when they fly aloft by the Names of MOST HOLY FATHERS,
MOST BLESSED, MOST EXCELLENT, and such like; themselves giving out, That they
are more blessed, than the holy virgin Mary, because she bare Christ but once,
and they make him, and bear him in their hands every day at the Altar. Thus
flying with their light wings of proud Titles, they make such a noise and sound
as Chariots drawn by many horses into the battle. For, deny any of these
things, and how violent, how vehement are they, by Disputations,
Excommunications, Suspentions, and Sentences of death it self? Surely, no
wheels of Chariots can flash out fire so, as these men do, if their
flickering wings of flattering Titles be touched. Fitly therefore the words of
S. John hit them. Their Scorpion tails and power to hurt was touched Apoc. 9.
10.
before, therefore I omit it now.

The tenth Mark is, Those Locusts have a King over them. And so have these
Romish Locusts their Pope, acknowledging no Magistrates authority over them,
but exalting him, and exempting themselves from all others. This King of the
Locustes is here called The Angel of the bottomless pit; and in the eleventh
Chapter, The Adoc. 11. 7.
Beast that comes out of the bottomless pit. Words of weight, to move all
Popish minds, if the Lord had not a purpose to destroy them. For they must
needs acknowledge, such a King is not worth the following; and, that their
Pope is this King, that which has been said, and may further be noted, of
him, clearly shows. For he that crosses and crusheth (to his uttermost
power) His Doctrine that came from Heaven, he is the King that comes out of
Hell, in whom S. Hierome says, the Devil dwells bodily. But the Pope does
so, as proof enough will manifest, and Ergo the conclusion follows as I
said. His Name also is fold here, which gives again great light. For albeit
the Pope be called Holy Father, and so forth; yet indeed he is a bloody
Destroyer, and so his right Name in Dan. 7. 6. 11. Zach. 11. Apoc. 9. 11.
Hebrewe, is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon, that is, destroying. Thus in the
Prophecy of the Revelation has God, you see, described a fearful kind of
Locustes, unto the consideration whereof, by reason of these Egyptian Locusts
or Grasshoppers we have slipped, I hope, not without some increase of feeling,
how dreadful their steps be, that continually walk in Romish ways, and will
not be reclaimed by any means. Our own safer judgment God make us thankful
for, and continue the blessed helps of our confirmation in his Truth, ever
unto us, his holy and Heavenly Word, a freedom to use all the profitable
exercises thereof, (as Preaching, hearing, reading, writing, praying,
conference, and whatsoever else) without fear, under the sweet smelling
government of a gracious Prince, our dread Sovereign. Amen, Amen.

10. Therefore Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in Verse. 16.
have, and said, I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you. And
now forgive me my sin only this once, and pray unto the Lord your God, that
he may take away from me this death one(...). Thus the wicked in extremities
seek to Gods Ministers, whom in their heart they hate and cannot abide. But
this hypocritical holiness of this dissembling King we have diverse times
noted before, and therefore may pass it over now. Yet mark the great
vehemence of his words, and consider in your mind, what a deep sin Hypocrisy
is, how disagreeing from the nature of God, who is all Truth and from that
blessing in the Gospel, of a pure heart. Moses Matthew. 5. 8. Ver. 18. and 19.
yielded again to pray to God; And, by a mighty strong West-winde the
Grasshoppers were taken away, and violently cast into the Red Sea, so that there
remained not so-much as one in all the coast of Egypt. But when it was done,
Ph(...)h showed himself in his old color, and 20.
would not let them go.

The 9. plague.
1. Where upon the Lord spoke again to Moses and said, Stretch out thine hand
toward heaven, that there may be upon the land of Egypt darkness, even
darkness that may be felt. Then Moses stretched-forth his hand toward
heaven, and there was a black darkness in the land of Egypt 3. days, no man
saw an other, neither rose up from the place where he was, for 3. days. The
manner of this darkness is described, first in these words, even that may be
felt; whereby either literally a very vile gross matter is meant (which
indeed might be felt) or at least so thick foggie and filthy, as was most
noisome, and might be said (as it were) palpable. Secondly, such it was as no
man saw an other, neither role-up from the place where he was, which flit be
taken Philo in vita Mosis, Aug. in Exodus
litterallie (as is said) was a most strange and fearful thing* and, if
figuratively, that it disabled them to go to work abroad, (according to the
Psalm, The sun arises, and man goes forth to his labor) even that way
also it was a great plague. Thirdly, the time is noted, for the space of three
days; a great while to be in such a case, as (were we but one hour in) it
would make the strongest natural man shake and be amazed. Fourthly, in the
book of Wisdom it is described by much fear in these words. When the
unrighteous thought to have thy holy people in subjection, they were bound with
the Wised. 17. 2.
bands of darkness and long night: and being shut up under the roof did lie
there to escape the everlasting Providence. And while they thought to be hid in
their dark 3.
sins they were scattered abroad in the dark covering of forgetfulness;
fearing horribly and troubled with visions. For the den that hid them kept them
not from fear: but the sounds that were about them troubled them, and 4.
terrible visions and sorrowful sights did appear. No power 5.
of the fire might give light, neither might the clear flames of the stars
lighten the horrible night. According whereunto is that in Philo written, Ignem
domesticum, quo quotidie vtimur, vel extinctum fuisse turbato aere, vel
crassissimis tenebris victum, vt nullum lumen caligo illa admitteret. That fire
and candell was either quite extinguished, or so overcome with the troubled
air, that no light could be admitted in that darkness. This then was the
fearful and most fearful manner of yt darkness; which makes me remember that
great darkness, which is said to have been in Hispaniola, when Columbus came
thither the second time, about the year of Christ 1493: And that which Tullie
writes of to have been in Cicilie, vt per biduum homo hominem non agnosceret;
that by the space of two days one man could not know another. All should make
us with thankful hearts acknowledge the Mercy of God in this one benefit of
Light (amongst infinite more) that we enjoy, and humbling our souls under him,
as the Lord of Light and darkness, Life and Death, Hell and Heaven, serve him in
reverence and fear according to his Will all the days of our life. S.
Augustine and others go farther in the Meditation of this darkness of Egypt,
and say, that it was a sign of the darkness of their minds then, and a plain
shadow of their woeful Night of ignorance and blindness, that is over some men
in all times, and admits no light. For the Egyptians, it is manifest, that
extreme was the fogge in their hearts, when such Wonders wrought no more. Such
deep security before punishment, such inflexible obstinacy, in, and under
punishment, such high pride after punishment, and such a monstrous dissembling
of repentance ever, (which both deceaueth the beholders, and hurts the users,
as One well says) argued darkness of mind, thick and black, vehemently to be
prayed against by all that wish to have saved souls in that Great day of God.
And for us in these times, and so ever to the worlds end, we are all to
consider, that our Ignorance is darkness in deed, and that very great darkness,
so termed by God himself, more dangerous than this of Egypt, in that the Soul
is hereby destroyed, and by that only the body was annoyed. Whereupon, by
this horror in Egypt, we may take occasion to consider of our selves, and by
that (darkness noted to be such a plague,) to think, whether our darkness be a
virtue? The Light of the body is the Eye (says our Math. 6. 22. 23 Luke. 11.
34.
Savior Christ:) If then the Eye be single, thy whole body shall be light.
But if thine Eye be wicked (or evil) then all thy body shall be dark.
Wherefore, if the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?
Now, as the Eye is to the body, so is the Judgment of the mind to the whole
life; and therefore darkness in judgment, most dangerous. S. Paul in like sort
notes Ignorance by the name and fruit of darkness, when he says of the
Gentiles to the Ephesians, that their understanding was darkened, and Ephesians. 4.
18.
they strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that was in them.
And of the Ephesians themselves, Ye were once darkness, but now are ye light
in the Lord; Ephe. 5. 8.
walk as the children of light. Many other places in the Scripture say the
like, terming still and ever Ignorance to be darkness, and noting an inward
darkness in man, of his mind, as well as an outward, of his eye. Which may make
us think, why God should so speak? and by consideration thereof (he ever
speaking most fitly) draw us to the observance of certain properties, wherein
there is agreement betwixt inward and outward darkness. First, outward darkness
hinders our eyes from discerning the outward objects, which by them should
be discerned, and therefore have their name tenebrae, a tenendo, because they
hold the eye from doing his duty; so does Ignorance (our inward darkness) hold
and hinder our judgment (which, as an eye, should guide our actions) from
discerning things fit to be done, and fit to be left undone; whereby, as blind
men, we fall into many ditches, that is, we commit and omit, do and leave
undone many things contrary to our duties, both to God and man.

Secondly, outward darkness hinders our going and walking about our work, or
for our health and comfort. For he that walks in darkness, cannot tell whither
he goes, John. 12. 35.
says Christ; and it is true in this sense: so Ignorance (the inward darkness)
hinders our judgments, our hearts and minds from going and walking through
the sweet fields of true Comforts, true knowledge, and Heavenly Meditations;
for in this sense also our Saviors words are true; A blind man (thus)
knows not whither he goes. A dark judgment and a blind heart knows not,
feels not, tastes not the pleasant paths of knowledge either in matters
Humane, or Divine. Miserable therefore is this darkness, and a woeful effect of
our fall in Adam, to be prayed against, and labored against, as much as we
possibly can, although (whilst we live) we shall groan under part of it,
knowing but in part, and seeing but in part, in this life, as the Apostle
teaches us. 2. Cor. 12. 9.


Thirdly, outward darkness makes men fall, and that often with great hurt, even
unto death: so does inward darkness of the mind make men fall with so much
peril, by how much the fall of soul is worse than the fall of body, and death
eternal worse than temporal. Let their way be dark and slipperie, says
David in the Psalm, as a means (both the one way, and the other) to bring men
to confusion.

Fourthly, outward darkness works in some horror and fear, (we knew it by
experience:) even so does in-ward darkness, if you observe either Scripture, or
experience. Scripture, when it is said, They shall fear, where no fear is
(meaning by the darkness and ignorance of judgment:) Experience in Caine, who
(through ignorance) cried with horror and fear, My sin is greater, than can
be forgiven; and in many dear children of God, who quake and quiver under the
taste and touch of sin, not yet able to reach by the light of mind (because
God will exercise them) to the sweetness, and riches of Gods mercy, revealed in
his promises. Examples are many, but a secret meditation in your self of what
you know, may best serve.

Fifthly, and lastly, outward darkness in some others (clean contrary) works
boldness and security, and is the deadly bane of modesty and honesty. As,
when the man that breaks Sirach. 23. 1^.
Wedlock thinks thus in his heart, Who sees me? I am compassed about with
darkness, the walls cover me, no body sees me; who^ need I to fear? the most
HIGH will not remember my sins, etc. So does inward darkness of Judgment and
heart (in some men) make boldness above measure to ask, to speak, to defend and
publish what were better passed over and buried with peace of Church and
Commonwealth. They see not in darkness what they do, but pleasing themselves
in a misse-conceipt for want of true judgment build up the Tower of Babell
very violently, to their great shame and reproof, both with God and man. Fitly
then you see (in regard of these properties, and many others) is Ignorance
called darkness by the holy Ghost, and thereby we admonished to pray and labor
against it, as a plague of God not unlike to this of Egypt. Which justly may
occasion your next Meditation to be, How it grows? that we may the better
^s^he^^ and prevent it. This will likewise appear by considering the causes of
outward darkness, and seeing whether there be not the like of inward darkness.
First then, outward darkness (or blindness of the body) grows in some by birth,
as the blind man in John healed by our Savior Christ, and many daily
experiences before our eyes: even so does inward darkness grow in us all from
our birth by the fall of Adam, that most excellent light and knowledge (wherein
he was created) being lost by him both to himself, and all his posterity,
until the Lord renew us in knowledge after his image, as he created us at
first according to the same by knowledge. Colos. 3. 10.


Secondly, outward darkness grows sometimes by too-much gazing upon bright and
glistering things, as (in experience) we sinde by white snow, white paper, and
the like: so does inward darkness grow also by fixing the mind too-much upon
the glistering glory of this World, the pompes and pleasures that shine in it.
Proof here of that rich Glutton, that rich Barne-builder in the Gospel, and
that Turne-coate Demas of whom S. Paul speaks, who all were blind, you
plainly see, with gazing too-much upon this tempting World. And how many
amongst us, men and women, be in this sort blind, he knows, who shall judge
both quick and dead, and who cannot be deceived by any colors. Good it is
therefore to take heed betime, and to turn away the eye from so hurtful an
object, duly and truly considering the nature of it. It is transitory and
abides not, it is vain and vile, please it never so much; So have all found
it that have gone before us, so shall we find it, and all that ever shall
follow after us. A Map of the world has Kingdoms and Countries very
beautifully set out in it, Cities, Churches, and Towers described lively in
variable colors; yet all is but Paper, and one drop of water will deface the
greatest Princes Palace in it: So is this World (which men love so much) in
deed very Paper, that is, very vain and fickle: And that heart which has
furnished it self with all these Castles and Towers (through a wicked love and
longing for them,) one Fit of an Ague will shake and shiuer in such sort, as no
pleasure shall remain of all these things. In the mean time, Religion there
is none where this love is, neither any fellowship with the Almighty. For as
hot Sommer-weather makes our inward heat less (by suffering it to
euaporate,) than Winters-colde does, which keeps it in; so does this World
fawning upon us, and the love of it living in us, eat out all zeal and
piety, leaving us colder within than adversity and the want of the world
does. And, Love God and the world to, we cannot, 1. John. 2. 15.
says S. John. David, clogged with Saul his Armor, said, he could not go;
and therefore put it all off again: Even so assuredly can no man march toward
Heaven, if his heart be buckled and fastened to this World, till he lay aside
that hinderance from him. That Speech of S. Cyprian should much be marked in
this point, Arridet mundus, vt saeuiat; blanditur vt fallat; allicit vt
occidat; extollit vt deprimat. Vna haecplacida, solida, firma, and perpetua
securitas, si quicquid in rebus humanis sublime and magnum videtur occulis ad
coelum elatis infra conscientiam tuam iacere, possis gloriari. This cursed
world fawneth, that it may be cruel; flattereth that it may decaue; allureth
that it may kill; and lifts up, that it may throw down. Wherefore this only
is sweet, sound, firm, and during security, if thou can truly auowe, that
whatsoever seems great and glorious in this world, with thine eyes lifted up
to Heaven thou have cast and thrown under thy heart; so that it shall not
press down thee, but thou will tread upon it in a Religious contempt
thereof, by comparison with Heaven and Heavenly joys. S. Augustine his Speech
also is worthy remembering; Vnicuique tempestas est suacupiditas. Amas Deum?
ambulas super mare. Amas seculum? absorbebitte. Amatores suos vorarenouit,
petare non nouit. Every man's lust (or vehement desire) is as a tempest to him
(like unto that in the Gospel, whereof Peter being afraid, began to sink.)
Love thou GOD? then thou walk upon the Sea, Love thou the world then
thou sinkest, and this Sea will swallow thee up. The world knows how to
devour her Lovers, but not how to refresh them and do them good. I might go
farther in this cause of darkness (if it were needful,) but this suffices, to
show you the way how to meditate further on it.

A Third way whereby outward blindness grows is by long being in darkness, as
in prison or else where: for (by experience) it is so found often. Even so, by
long custom of walking and living in the outward works of darkness, grows a
strong and thick inward darkness in the heart of man and woman. Proof hereof
Ahab, Manasses, Herod, Judas, and such like, too many also (in our days) who
having long used Swearing, Lying, Uncleanenes, etc, are grown so blind in
them, that they neither will leave them, neither be persuaded they tend so to
their destruction as they do. These blind creatures shrink to hear of this
Egyptian darkness: and yet their own, ten thousand times worse, they never
shake at. Let it make us remember the words of wise Sirach, A man that is
accustomed Sirach. 23. 15.
to opprobrious words, will never be reformed all the days of his life. Why?
because Custom of sinning takes away the sense of sinning, and long aboade in
darkness makes stark blind. Accustom not thy mouth therefore, says he, to
swearing, neither take up for a Custom the naming of the Holy one. Where still
mark the word Custom, Custom, and see what a strong destroyer it is of the
sight (the inward sight and light I mean, of our hearts and minds.)

Fourthly, overmuch heat may hurt the bodily eyes; as, we all know, the
hotedung did Toby his eyes: Even so over hot desires of gain hurts the
inward light, as we know, both by that which has been said touching the
world, and by that which S. Paul says, that they which 1. Tim. 6. 9.
will be rich fall into temptations and snares, and into many foolish and
noisome lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction. For the desire of
money is the root of all evil, which (while some lusted after) they erred
from the Faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. They that
will be rich, I say again, and (I pray you) mark the Apostles words, yt is,
they which have resolved with themselves, set their hearts upon it and
concluded it, that by hab or nab, by one way or other, whatsoever Vijs and
modis.
it cost them, they will be rich and have the wealth they possibly can attain
to. These, these men with this Will, (this resolved and settled Will) fall into
temptations, and so forth. For this is a kind of pestilent heat within, which
as powerfully thrusts out the inward eye and light of the mind, as ever any
outward heat did the eye of the body. And then, the inward eye being out,
nothing but darkness is there, and so a falling into all dangerous Courses that
may lead to destruction and perdition. Then usury is no sin; no, not usury
upon usury; oppression and deceit be no sins, stealth and robbery (if it
may be any way colored) is wisdom, and well; yea, murder and blood bite
not. But is the Lord of Heaven pleased with this sinful Will to be rich, and
with these exorbitant ways? or, is this heat a pleasing heat unto him,
because he is slow to wrath and vengeance? no, no, and that shall the end
declare both upon the wealth, and the house, that this dealing is in appointed
time. In the mean while we are taught by this place to Timothy, to beware of
such a Will, and of such an inward heat as causes such inward blindness. Soon
enough, if well enough, say we ever; and for these transitory things, as we
brought them not into the world, so shall we not carry them out of the world.
Balaam, Gehesi, Judas, and such like, preach unto us to beware of goods evil
gotten. A darkness then you see there is within, as well as without; and the
more dangerous far is the inward, because it hides from us things of greater
consequence than does the outward. Not to see credenda, agenda, and cauenda,
things to be believed, things to be performed, and things to be avoided, is a
horrible darkness. Caine saw not the first, and Salomons foolish young man, led
as an Ox to the slaughter, and as a fool Pro 7 7 22.
to the stocks, saw neither the second, nor the third. Wherefore the Lord (in
great mercy) has ever been careful to furnish us with means and helps
against it. First, he created us (as has been showed) with light and
knowledge most excellent; he provided a great Book (even the Book of the
World, created by him) wherein the invisible things of him, that is, his
eternal power and Godhead Romans 1. 20.
might be seen, and much excellent knowledge might be had; And this Book
remains still, if we will read in it, an enemy to darkness. Of which Book
Clemens Alexandrinus spoke, when he said, Creatio mundi Scriptura Strom. 6.
Dei; The Creation of the world is Gods Writing. Also that Antonie (mentioned
in the Story) unto whom a Philosopher coming and asking him, what he did
without Books, he answered, O Philosophe, meus codex est Natura Hist. tripaer.
lib. 8
creaturarum: qui adest cum voluero, verbaque mihi relegit Dei. O Philosopher,
my^ Book is the Nature of all creatures: which Book is ever present with me
when I will, and delivers to me the words of God. Here we see the most
admirable quantity of the Sun and Stars; here we read the variety, the
qualities, the motion, and the continuance in order appointed of all Creatures
in Heaven, in Earth, and in the Sea; so as no man can be either weary of
reading, or read without great profit in this Book. Nevertheless, the Lord
has not here left us; but as unto the Star manifesting the birth of his
Math. 1. 2. 5.
Son, he pleased to add the Scriptures also which witnessed more particularly
time, place, etc: so he has over and besides the Book of the Creation given
us another (more excellent by much) to drive from our hearts this damnable
darkness, and to keep us in light, pleasing to himself, and profitable unto
us. Of this Book, far better we may use Damihi Magistrum, give me the
Master, than Cyprian could use then, of Tertullians works. For this Book
passes All Books that ever were or shall be, (I mean, the Book of Gods holy
Bible: which Book, says Hierome, shall remain with us till we be as the
Angels in Heaven. Go we forward, and consider how also to this Book he has
added Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors, and Doctors in all times, to
open and expound the Ephesians. 4. 11
same unto us, that by all means we might be enducd with light, love light,
live in light, and die in light. Add again the appointing of the Sabbath day,
wherein men John. 5. 39. Luke 16. 16. 29. 32. Deuteronomy. 6. 6. 7. 1. Cor. 14. 20.
shonld rest from their labors, and hearken to this Book together with the
many precepts given to hear, to read, to search, to know, and understand, and
not to be as children, perceauing nothing. Think with your self often, how
the little Infant grows to strength, able to go by it self: is it not by
sucking and plucking his Mothers breasts? even so does the Child of God grow
to strength of grace, and from grace to grace, by hanging continually upon
these two Breasts, the old and new Testament. And as all men differ from brute
Beasts by reason, and knowledge: so differs one man from another, by more and
more knowledge in this Book. Woe to those Teachers then, that lull us a
sleep, and tell us that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, that give us not
leave, either to read, or pray, or do any duty, in a tongue that we know, but
like those cursed Scribes and Pharisees, those hypocrites, shut up Math. 23. 13.
the Kingdom of Heaven before men, neither going in themselves, nor suffering
others that would enter, to come in. Let this now spoken, make us see their
fault, and that misery so to live: as also this most sweet blessing of
knowledge now vouchsafed to us, by ye mercy of God through the happy
government of his Anointed servant, our dear and dread Sovereign: and
sending up to God our thankful thoughts both for it, and him, and begging the
continuance of both long and long unto us.

2. It follows in your Chapter, But all the children Ver. 23.
of Israel had light where they dwelt. Which surely was a very admirable thing,
the houses of Egyptians and Israelites joining (as it should seem) one close
to another, as ours, in these days, do. For else why should the blood be
striked upon the door posts of the Israelites, for a sign to the destroying
Angel, where to kill, and where to pass over, if all the Israelites had dwelt
by themselves, and had not been mingled with the Egyptians? This mind was
Gregory Nyssen of, and therefore he says, Nontantum in Gosen, vbi co^muniter
morabantur, sed cum inter Aegyptios promiscue etiam habitarent; and in hoc,
maximum miraculum. Not only in Gosen, where only Israelites (for the most
part) dwelled, but among the Egyptians being mingled and dwelling together, the
Israelites had light, and the Egyptian darkness; And herein was the greatest
miracle. The good we may take, by this strange work of GOD, is, first to
learn, how able our Heavenly Father is to make a separation betwixt his
Children and the Wicked, when he executes wrath and Justice, if his good
pleasure be so to do: though they be in one field together, in one house
together, and in one Matr. 24. 40. 41.
bed together; yet can be choose the one, and refuse the other. Wherefore true
is that Saying of the Psalm, If his wrath be kindled but a little. Blessed are
all they Psalm. 2. 12.
that put their trust in him. Fear we not then in the time of Plague, of
War, or other Public calamity, least we should perish with the wicked,
hand over head: but remember this Place, and say in your heart with comfort and
faith; O Lord my GOD, and gracious Father, I know thine able hand to make a
separation (if thou please) in this calamity, betwixt thy poor Lambs, and
the Goats, as thon did in that darkness betwixt the Israelites and
Egyptians: therefore, I fly unto thee in humble acknowledgement of my sin,
and for him that had no sin, I beg that (if thy good pleasure may be so)
thou would vouchsafe to save me from this Sword of thine, to let the light
of thy mercy and loving countenance shine about my dwelling, as thy cheerful
light did about the Israelites. So shall my soul and heart ever praise Thee,
and thank Thee. But if otherwise, LORD and Father, thy Will be done, and not
mine; only in the world to come, acknowledge me, as I do not doubt but thou will, and it shall suffice.

Secondly, let this place be observed, as a very plain Figure of that, which
we see amongst us every day. At one house dwelt an Egyptian, and it was all
dark; at the next an Israelite, and it was all light: so now at one house
dwells a superstitious Recusant, or a profane Atheist, and all is dark; At
the very next house dwells a zealous Professor of the truth, who reads
the Scriptures, hears them preached, frequenteth the Sacraments, and
faithfully labors that himself with his whole Family, may live according
to the Word; and here is all light, which shall lead to the light eternal
with God and all his host, when the good hour comes. God strengthen our
hearts evermore in the love of this light, and make us truly thankful for
these lightsome days. Amen.

CHAP. 11.
There is nothing more common both in these Books of Moses, Genesis. 6. Joshua.
2. 1. Samu. 23. Esaias. 38. 2. Kings. 28.
and other Books of Scripture, than to set that after, which (in precise
order) was to go before; so is it in this Place. For what now is said in these
first Eight verses of this Chapter, (by due order) should be put before the 28.
verse, of the former Chapter; which if you do, and bring in the 28. verse,
after those words in the 8. verse, (And after this I will depart) then the 29.
verse of the former Chapter will follow well, and after that, the end of the
8. verse of this Chapter, to wit, So he went out from Pharaoh very angry, etc.

The chief Heads of this Chapter are these three. 1. A Denuntiation of a new
plague. 2. An Admonition to the Israelites what to do. 3. The Plague it self.


1. COncerning the first, it is contained ver. 1.
(as you see) in these words: Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh
and Egypt. And to make use to our selves of it, you that are acquainted (by
your private reading) with the Course of the Scriptures, very well know the
manner of Gods dealing in this matter, from the beginning to the end. First,
how mild it was, then how (by degrees it increased to sharper and sharper,
till the deliverance of his Church and people were effected. At the first, he
appointed Moses and Aaron with the Elders of Israel, to go to Pharaoh, and to
entreat him mildly and dutifullie, saying. The Lord God of the Hebrews has
met with Chap. 5. 3.
us, WE PRAY THEE therefore let us go three days journey into the Wilderness,
that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God. But this praying would not serve,
wherefore the Lord went nearer them, by great and powerful wonders, yet by
degrees touching them, and not with the greatest at the first. He caused Moses
rod to be turned to a Serpent, etc. A thing that hurt them not, yet in all
reason should have moved them. Then, he turned their waters into blood, which
did somewhat touch them. After, when that prevailed not, he annoyed them with
filthy Frogs, and so still, you know, by degrees, until he had brought 9.
fearful plagues upon the Land. But as you also know, none of them all would
work the deliverance of the Church, but still with an hardened heart, as soon
as any plague was removed, Pharaoh returned to his disobedience against the
Lord. Whereupon at length God came to these words: Yet will I bring one plague
more: as if he should have said, notwithstanding that all these former works
can prevail nothing with Pharaoh, yet let him not think that he can be too
hard for me; for he shall well find, that I both can and will be too hard for
him, I have yet one Plague more, which I will bring upon him, and that shall so
stoop him, that he shall not only let my people go, but shall be most glad
of the dispatch of them. See we then in these things, for our own use, the
Course and proceeding which ever (from the beginning) the Lord has used, and
ever will unto the end, as he shall see occasion: even first in mercy to
entreat, and in mildnes (by more gentle means) to allure; then in the end, by
power and Judgment to compel, when the former course will not serve. In the
first age, when the old world would not be reformed, but more and more
provoked him to wrath, by taking wives descended of wicked Parents, more
regarding, in a fleshly sensuality, outward beauty, than inward virtue, the
Lord said, His Spirit should no longer strive with man, meaning, with lenity
and gentleness, as unto that time it had done, but now he would bring upon them
his one plague more, as here upon Egypt, which should be indeed a stooping
plague, (as here this was) and should suffice to crush crooked disobedience,
and to pull down haughty pride, as was meet; That was, the Great flood,
which destroyed man, woman, and Genesis 6. 17. 18.
child, saving eight persons appointed to be saved. When Sodom and Gomorrha
would not (...) warned by any way of mercy and patience, used by a gracious
God unto them many years, then that one plague more of fire and brimstone from
Heaven came, and stooped them, and burnt them to ashes, as they deserved.
Iezabell had fair Genesis 19. 24.
warnings, to amend her life, to love Religion, to leave Idolatry, and to
become a better woman both to GOD, and the world, many a year before her fall
came, (Eliah that worthy Prophet living by her, and doing great works to show
that God was with him) yet nothing would serve. Therefore, at the last, came
the stooping Plague, and she was thrown down at the window, where the
Dogs 2. Kings. 9. 33.
did eat her up all, saving the scull, feet, and palms of her hands. A
dreadful example of Gods wrath upon a 35.
sinner, when mild and merciful ways to amend him, will not serve. Manasses,
a King of great ungodliness, (as you see in the Story) at length was brought,
by the stooping plague of yron-fetters, and bondage, to be humbled, 2. Cron.
33. 12
and repent, as was fit for him. What gracious dealing did God first use
toward Nabuchadnezzar in forwarning him by a Dream, what should be the end of
his wicked life, then to provide Daniel for him, both to expound the same unto
him, and to give him that good advise specified in the Text, even to break off
his sins by righteousness, Dan. 4. 24.
and his iniquities by mercy toward the poor, and that Dan. 4. 24. 27.
there might be an healing of his error? yet all would not serve: but he went
on, and offended God more and more, as you see in the 27. verse. Wherefore, God
brought upon him his stooping plague, and drove him from among 29. and 30.
men, to have his dwelling among the beasts of the field, to eat grass as the
Oxen, and to have his body wet with the dew of Heaven, till his hair was
grown as Eagles feathers, and his nails like unto birds claws. By which one
plague more, the Lord, as you know, brought him home and humbled him. Let us
come unto that fearful example of Jerusalem, ^he wofullest Story that ever
pen committed to paper. What preaching and teaching had they first vouchsafed
unto them? What Prophets and men of God full of grace and power lived among
them? yea, even the Son of God himself, Christ Jesus, they had in the flesh
to converse with them, who both by Doctrine and miracles most admirable,
offered them life and comfort, and labored to draw them from their danger;
but all would not serve, they killed the Prophets, and stoned them, which were
sent unto them, they despised all, and with bloody hands, crucified the Lord
of life himself, in a most high contempt of God, and all his offered grace.
What remained therefore, but that the Lord should drawforth his last plague,
his one plague more, his stooping plague as here he did against Pharaoh, and
to make such a rebellious people know themselves? So he did, and sent against
them Titus the son of Vespasian, with the Roman power, who besieged their
City at such a time, as the greatest concourse was there, brought them to
famine, and such misery, as never befell any people in this world but them,
and in the end, utterly overthrew them all, their City, and glory, and
whatsoever had exalted it self against God. O misery! who can read it, or
speak of it with dry eyes? When once they began to issue-out, compelled with
famine, they were still taken and crucified upon crosses, and gibbets set up
before the walls, that they which were within might see them, and give over,
but yet they would not. Five hundred a day were thus hanged up, till there were
neither trees to be gotten, nor any more space left to set them in. Amongst
whom, no doubt, were the children of those that cried against our Savior,
Crucify him, crucify him, his blood be upon Luke 23 21. Math. 27. 25.
us, and upon our children. They regarded not God his Son, and God regarded
not their sons, when time came. The number of dead bodies unburied, and the
multitude of other miseries was so great, that Titus himself shaked at it, and
lifting up his hands to Heaven, cried: O Lord, O Lord this is not my doing, as
if he should have said, it is thy wrath and Judgment, thy Justice and
vengeance pursuing this people, or else it could never be thus. Certain of
them getting meat, for compassion sake, in the Camp of the Enemies, were yet
so prosecuted with this anger of God, that when they hoped their lives were in
some safety, suddenly in the night, by the bloody Soldier, imagining that
sure they had gold and Jewels within them, which they had swallowed to convey
them for their use, were miserably ^^aine, and slit-vp, their bowels raked in,
for that which happily was not there, to the number of two thousand in one
night, which sore grieved the General Titus when he heard of it. There was a
desire to know the number of dead ca^cases, carried out of the City, for want
of burial, to be thrown in the Ditches, as dung upon the earth, but the
number was numberless, and no way to know it certainly, but out of one gate,
the Keeper had noted to be carried out A hundred and fifty thousand dead
bodies. Which miserable creatures before they died, were driven to eat the
Leather of their Shoes, the Leather of their Girdles, the Leather of their
Bucklers and Targets, the dung of the Stable, and in the end, their very
Children. A stouping plague indeed, and never to be forgotten of Gods people,
that hear it, but to be used as a mighty motive to stir up their hearts ever,
to a due fear of that power, that can thus crush them, if they will rebel
against him. Now appeared an use of our Saviors words, when going to his
passion, he said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, Luke. 23. 28. 29.
but for your selves, and your Children. For behold, the days will come, when
men shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombes that never bare, and the
paps which never gave suck. Then shall they begin to say to the 30.
mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us, etc, which was now
verified in a most woeful misery. Let never Sinners then provoke the Lord in
this manner, but so profit by his easier Crosses laid upon them, and by his
long-suffering-patience vouchsafed toward them, as these great and terrible
Testimonies of his anger may be ever far and far from them. For, if not,
assuredly he is the same still, as mighty as ever, as just as ever, and he
has his stooping plague remaining for every man and woman, which will rebel.

Thus have you seen the Lords manner in former times. Come now to our selves,
and these times. Surely the Lord is all one, and his dealings all one, even
with us. For he first entreats us by his Word, the mildest way that possibly
can be, when a man or woman sitting in the Church shall feel God by the
Preachers speech in his or her bosom, and yet no man living know it, no not
the Preacher himself, that he hitteth upon them. Then, if this does not serve,
the Lord comes nearer, and lays upon us his easier Crosses, yet greater and
greater by degrees. Our friends grow unkind, our Servants unfaithful, our
Children undutiful, our goods abate, and our health changes to sickness and
grief. And if these also become unprofitable (as too often they are) then the
Lord goes to his Quiver, and takes out a strong arrowe to shoot at us; as,
The sweating sickness, The devouring plague, or such like, which shall at once
sweep the Earth clean from such rebelling Spirits, and stoop us unto Hell,
because unto Heaven we would never be brought. This you have seen to be true
in some part with your own eyes, and therefore we ought to think of it
earnestly for our amendment. Happy is the man who takes his time to turn to
his God, that he may be saved!

I read of One, that said, he had but one Book, and the same Book had but
two leaves, a white leaf, and a red; yet could he never read quite over
those two leaves, though he lived many years, and read diligently, so much
matter was contained in them. For, in the white leaf, he said, were laid
down all the Mercies and favors of God vouchsafed to mankind either in
general, or particular: And, in the red leaf all his fearful Judgments
pouredout upon sinners, which were disobedient, and would not be reformed. This
Book has been in all ages, and godly persons have had a care to read in
it. David looked upon the White leaf, and saw (first) such heaps of Mercies
toward mankind ingenerall, that he cried, Lord, what is man that thou art so
mindful of him? and the Son of Psalm. 8. 4.
man, that thou visitest him? For, thou have made him little 5.
lower than God, and crowned him with glory and worship. Thou have made him to
have dominion in the works 6. 7.
of thy hands: thou have put all things under his feet; All sheep and oxen;
yea, and the beasts of the field; The fowls of the air, and the fish of the
sea, with that which 8.
passes through the paths of the seas. Then in particular toward himself,
he saw also such Goodness, as that he likewise cried, Who am I, O Lord God,
and what is my house, that thou have brought me hitherto? with all the 2. Sam.
7. 18.
rest that follows in the Place worthy your reading fully over by your
self. In the Red leaf he read so many Judgments of God as that he prayed:
Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for no flesh living can be
justified in thy sight. If thou Lord shall mark what is done amiss, O Lord
who may abide it; Have mercy upon me, O Lord, according to thy loving kindness,
and Psalm. 51. 1.
according to the multitude of thy compassions put away mine miquities. Jacob
read in this Book, and seeing in the white leaf Gods gracious goodness
toward him, said, O Lord, over this river did I come with my staff, and now
have I gotten two bands. I am not worthy of the least of Genesis 32. 10.
all the mercies, and all the truth, which thou have showed unto thy servant.
In the Red leaf also he saw such griefs, as it had pleased God to exercise
him with all, and told the King that his days had been but few and evil,
and he Genesis 47. 9.
had not attained unto the years of the life of his Fathers; yet was he then a
hundred and thirty years old. Others also have done the like, seeing the
infinite favors of God, and these fearful punishments, two and thirty
Thousand destroyed for the golden Calfe, to teach men to beware of Idolatry.
Threescore and Ten thousand destroyed with the plague, for David's numbering of
the people, to teach men to beware of pride, and vain confidence in any
Earthly thing. Corah, Dathan, and Abiram with their Families swallowed up alive
with the gaping Earth, to teach men to take heed of murmuring against
authority, and that which is the Gospel, Bind him hand and foot, to teach
us that what parts are joined in vitio, they shall assuredly be joined in
supplicio. Sin together and be punished together is a Keckning that shall not
fail. Wherefore, since things are thus, as well in our days, as in former
times, what remains but that this knowledge humble us under his mighty hand,
that can ever stoop us at his pleasure. Let us remember the words of David,
and use them as our own, Agnosco iniquitatem, etc. I know mine iniquities,
and my Sin is ever before me. Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither
chasten me in thy displeasure, etc. Let us remember that good Saying of the
Father, Non litigando, sed flendo Deum vincimus, We overcome God not by
striving with him, but by weeping before him. The stubborn Oak is torn up by
the roots, when the bowing Reed stands still. Never can the lower part of
the wheel come upward, unless the upper part go downward: neither ever can a
man in his death be glorified, unless in his life he be truly humbled. You
remember the Fable of the wise Fox, who would not visit the sick Lion,
because he saw not any come out, that went in; Let it profit you much to beware
of Hell, from whence you knew never any return, that went thither. Now is the
time to think of these things, the continuance in Hell is for ever, and the
pain there, is without measure. Better late than never to think of it. Our
Books tell us of a light woman, who spending her time in sin, desired her
wicked Associate to bestow on her a new Gown, which when he did stick at,
she instantly answered. Do I desperately cast away both body and soul for
ever to content thee, and do thou miserably deny so small a request to me?
I will look to my self hereafter better, and avoid thee, and this wicked
life; which if she did, it was a happy denial made unto her. But certain it
is that God has many ways to pull such out of the fire, as he will have
saved. The like we read of a Covetous Father, who raking up riches very
disorderly, suddenly (God purposing mercy toward him) called for his eldest
Son and for a Chafing Dish of coals requiring his Son to put his finger
in, and to burn it off. At the first he thought his Father had but iested, but
perceauing in the end his settled resolution, he prayed to be excused he might
not do it. To whom then earnestly his Father answered, and shall I to make thee
a Great man in the world, so heap up riches by all unlawful means, that Jam
sure eternally to burn both body and soul, and thou not endure the loss of
one finger for me? I will alter my Course in time, and consider of that, which
hereafter cannot be redressed. Were it true, or were it a fiction, to a wise
man it carries a Morrall with it. Sweet is our God if we will return; and as
yet it is day, that we may return. Were thy sins as red as scarlet, says
He, I will make them as white as snow. The sacrifice of God is a troubled
Spirit; A broken and contrite heart he shall never despise. Iosia his heart
melted, and he found it so. Ezechias sorrowed, and he found it so. Peter wept
bitterly, and he found it so. Never any sorrowing sinner, but he found it so.
God then (in mercy) so stoop us by his Spirit, that his outward Stoopings may
ever be far from us. This example of Pharaoh preaches unto us to be wise.

2. Secondly, consider these words, When he lets Ver. 1.
you go, he shall at once chase you hence. That is, he shall have you away
without any condition, stop, or stay at all. It is ever sweet to the servants
of God, to observe this mighty power and outstretched arm over all his
Enemies, when once he sets on to do a thing. As here how he was able not
only to give his people passage; but to make Pharaoh as glad to rid them away,
as ever he was desirous to hold them. So in Genesis when Abimelech Genesis 20. 2.
had taken Abraham's wife, (supposing she had been but his sister) God caused
him not only to restore her 7. 8.
without any injury, but he was up very early in the morning, says the
Story, to see it to be done, that is, he hasted to do it, and had no rest in
his mind till it was done. What comfort then in this God ever? what rest and
peace in relying upon him? what assurance of that end, issue, victory, and
deliverance that he (in his wisdom) shall know to be best for us, seeing he
is thus able? Lord, make us patient then, willing to tarry thy leisure, and
ever contented with thy pleasure. For thou can do for us what thou will, and
when thou will, all earthly pride must stoop to thee; and if Jeroboam stretch
out his hand against thy 1 Kings. 13 4. 6.
Prophet, thou can make him never pluck it back again till thy Prophet
pray for him. Who has resisted him, and had peace, (says Job?) The Lord of
Hosts has decreed it, and who can disappoint it (says the Prophet?) God would
have Joseph exalted, his Brethren storm at it, and practice against it; but
all in vain, when time comes it must be so. Saul grieueth that David is
likely to succeed him; but all in vain, it must be so. The Jews work against
Christ, yet to no end: for the Lords purpose must come topasse. The farther you
go in this Meditation, the sweeter shall you find it.

The 2. part.
1. THe second general Head of this Chapter (I said) was an Admonition to the
Israelites, what to do between the Denunciation of another plague, and the
Execution of the same; Even every man to require of his Ver. 2.
neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor Jewels of silver, and Jewels of
gold; Which they did, and were greatly enriched by them. Concerning which
matter remember with your self what was fore-tolde four hundred years ago
to Abraham: namely, That his seed should be strangers in a strange Land so
many years; but in the end should come forth with great substance. Now was it
fulfilled (as you may see) in the next Chapter, (So Chap. 12. 36.
they spoiled the Egyptians:) Noting by the word of (spoiling) a very great
measure of riches in things desired. We may rightly ground this Comfort upon
it: That be the time never so long before he do it; yet ever in the end GOD
will perform what he has promised, and never fail. Four hundred years
space shall not hinder, but that at last his Truth shall appear. Apply it
then to what most may ease you, and be assured he is the same. In matter of
sin you have his promise, As I live, I will not the death of a sinner, etc.
He shall never break it, and therefore be comforted. In matter of want you
have his promise, All these things shall be ministered unto you; And you are
better than many Sparrowes, etc. Rest upon it, He is ever true. In matter of
trial you have his promise, He will never lay more upon you than he will make
you able to bear. Joy in it, and know, that he cannot lie, his word shall
stand, and you shall find it.

2. But a Question is moved, whether it was lawful for the Israelites thus to
do, or no? And, whether we may imitate them and do the like? whereunto
diverse men make diverse Answers; and we may take profit by them all. Basil
says, Haebrei honesta astutia ab Egyptijs mercedem operarum suarum receperunt,
qua hactenus defraudati fuerunt. The Hebrews by an honest craft received of
the Egyptians recompense for their labors, whereof hitherto they had been
defrauded. Which Speech (without reference to the Commandment of GOD) cannot
well stand. For the Apostles Rule is plain, That no man oppress or defraude
his brother in 1 These. 4. 6.
any matter: for the Lord is an Auenger of all such things. To lend is a duty
necessary, when we can do it, and not arbitrarie, as appears by the Law
made for Recompense in case of hurt done to the thing lent: which would never
have been made, had it been at our pleasure. It is also a part of our love to
our Neighbor, and a breach of the Eight Commandment, to deny, when I may
lend. Wherefore, that which Augustine says of the rich man may be truly also
said of one that will not lend, Dives ille non damnatur quod aliena tulerit,
sed quod egentisua non tribuerit; and ad petenda minima peruenit, qui hic
paruanegauit. That rich man was not condemned because he took from others
what was not his own, but because he gave not to others what was his own; and
he was driven to ask lesser things, who here denied little things. But it is
withal a duty again (on the other side) truly to restore what is borrowed;
and kindly to make recompense for any hurt done. Craft and cunning (in ye
matter of borrowing and lending) I like not to call honest. Josephus has
another opinion in his Antiquities, namely, that the Egyptians did freely give
these things to the Israelites, partly to be rid of them without any further
death, (for they said, we shall die all,) and partly in a remorse, for the
Chap. 12 33.
passed wrongs which they had done unto them so long. The first Reason may
teach us to prefer our lives before any worldly trash whatsoever; (which yet
many among us will not do;) but sparing money in meat, in apparel, in
physic, in healthie dwelling, and such like, cast away the maine Chance,
which is, their life, and loose all. Mezentius his cruelty is said to have
been this, To tie a quick man to a dead, till the dead should kill the quick.
And surely it is Satan's cruelty (at this day) to lock some so fast to their
dead treasure, that in the end they perish by it, and that eternally. S.
Augustines Speech is too true, Mundus clamat, Ego deficiam; Caroclamat, Ego
inficiam; Diabolus clamat, Ego decipiam; Christus clamat, Ego reficiam, etc;
The World cries, I will fail thee; The Flesh cries, I will infect thee; the
Devil cries, I will deceive thee; Christ cries, I will refresh thee; and yet
for one that will follow Christ, the other three shall have many. The second
Reason may draw us to the like remorse when ever there shall be the like
occasion. For, it was a grace of God in David, that his heart smote him when
he had sinned: And in those Jews, that they were pricked: In the King, Acts.
2. 37.
that he would ask, what had been done for Mordecai in recompense of his
faithful service, then read of in that Chronicle. Our injuries are many, and
our favors few, but thankful requitals please God and man. An aged Master
and Mistress (under whom you grew up to be able to live) should not be
forgotten when God makes you rich, and them poor. Among the virtues of David
this was not the least, that he carefully enquired for some of Saul's house, to
whom he might show kindness for Ionathans sake, etc. The Third opinion in this
Question is S. Augustines, whereof I like best, because expressly it mentions
the Commandment of God, which indeed was all in all in this point. Hoc Deus
iussit, qui nouerat quid quemque pati oportebat, nec Israelitae in hoc furtum
fecerunt, sed Deo iubenti ministerium praebuerunt. This God commanded, who
well knew what was fit for every man to suffer, neither did the Israelites in
this commit any stealth, but yield their obedience to God commanding. To the
same end speaks Nazienzen also. Rapuerunt spolia ab eo, qui dicit, meum est
argentum, meum est aurum. They took these spoils by the warrant of him, who
says, silver is mine, gold is mine. Rupertus says, mercedem quam illi unjust
detinuerunt, hij just abstulerunt: The wages which they unjustly withheld,
these Israelites justly took away. But that could not be without warrant of
Gods Commandment, and therefore that must necessarily be understood. Which
being so, we plainly here see (to our comfort) how careful God is to have his
Children well recompensed for either the wrongs which they have sustained, or
the faithful service which they have performed. The Egyptians, when they least
think of it, shall recompense them here, and that fully. Jacob was thus
regarded also, you know, by God for his honest service to Laban, when the
sheep brought forth young of party color, till he was Genesis 30. 39 45.
increased exceedingly, and had many flocks, Mayd-seruants, and Men-seruants,
Camels, and Asses. Neither ever shall any Servant, Artificer, or painful man
find it otherwise, if he walk in his place, as in the sight of God, doing his
duty. God can do it, God will do it, and men should be staide with it both
from idleness, and untruth in their dealings.

3. Another sweet thing we may also see by this point; namely, how Crosses and
losses (by a gracious God) are turned, in time, to his Childrens joy and gain.
Abraham had no Child in many years, and to him it was a great grief; but, in
the end he had one given, of whom came the blessing of all Nations, and a
multitude like to the Stars of Heaven (for number.) So was grief turned into
joy to Abraham. Jacob lost his Joseph, looking upon his bloody Coat brought
home by his brethren, and O woe of woes! but Jacob had afterwerd his Joseph
again, with which joy, the Scripture says, the Spirit of Jacob revived. Genesis
45. 27.
Anna likewise was barren, to her great grief; but in the end she had a
Samuel, to her unspeakable joy. David endured many sharp showers, but at last
he has the Crown, and many comforts. Mordecai his fear, and Queen Hesters
fear, how ended they with joy to themselves, and the whole Nation? Tarry then
Gods time, and live in his fear: you see what a sweet Regarder he is, in time,
of his childrens woes.

4. But how came it to pass, that the Egyptians so willingly parted with such
things, when they were asked? The Text answers, and tells you, because the
Lord gave the Israelites favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Ver. 3.
So are all hearts in his hand, and he turns them ever as he pleases for his
Childrens comfort. To Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he wrought favor in strange
places with the Greatest, and with the smallest. Nehemiah found grace with the
Great King by His working: Joseph, Daniel, and Psalm. 84.
many more. And, the Lord gives grace and worship, says the Psalm,
withholding no good thing from them that live a godly life. Flattery and
briberie may get fading friends; but when the Lord works favor, the comfort
is great, and the favor is permanent.

5. For our imitation of this Act, the matter is soon answered: what they did
here, had warrant from him, whose Will is, Regula iustitiae, the Rule of right,
and they did well. But such extraordinary things may not be followed, when
the like warrant is wanting. Yet in some sort we may learn of them, namely, to
borrowe of the Heathens, Philosophers, Orators, Astronomers, or the like, the
best Jewels they have, and to apply them to the service of God, as these
Israelites did (afterward) these Egyptian Jewels. For Divinity is as a Lady
and Queen Exodus 25.
which ought to be served by all other Sciences, and so, as servants to her,
they to be used. Where I remember the Saying of our old Countey-man Beda,
writing upon the Kings: Turbat acumen legentium, and deficere cogit, qui eos
Quid cuius esset simpliciter confitebatur, illud aiebat Tertulliani, illud
Cypriani, illud Lactantij, illud Hilarij est. Atque in hunc modum eruditionis
gloriam declinando eruditissimus habebatur. Hierony. de Nepotiano.
alegendis secularibus libris omnibus modis existimat prohibendos, in quibus si
qua inuenta sunt vtilia, quasi sua sumere licet. Alioquin Moses and Daniel
sapientia and literis Aegyptiorum Chaldeorumque non paterentur erudiri, quarum
tamen superstitiones and delicias horrebant; nec etiam ipse Magister Gentium
aliquot versus Poetarum suis vel scripturis, vel dictis indidisset, etc; He
troubles the mind of the Readers, and makes them faint, who thinks they
should be altogether inhibited from reading of humane Writers, in which if
there be any profitable things found, a man may take them as his own.
Otherwise, Moses and Daniel should never have suffered themselves to be
instructed in the wisdom of the Egyptians and Caldeans, whose superstitions
and delights they abhorred: Neither would the Doctor of the Gentiles (Saint
Paul) have interlaced some Verses of the Gentiles either in his writings, or
in his speeches. More of which matter if you desire to see, I refer you to S.
Augustine, who speaks at large of it with many Aug. de doctrina Chr. 2. lib.
c. 40.
others. Only let there be no vain ostentation in the use of them, but
remember ever S. Bernards words, Sunt qui scire volunt, vt sciantur, and
vanitas est: Sunt qui scire volunt, vt sciant, and curtositas est: Sunt qui
scire volunt, vt lucrentur, and cupiditas est: Sed sunt qui scire volunt vt
edificent, vel edificentur, and charitas est. There are, that desire to know,
that they may be known, and it is vanity: There are, which desire to know,
that they may but know, and it is curiosity: There are, which desire to
know, that they may gain by their knowledge, and it is covetousness; But there
are which desire to know, that they may edify others, or may be edified, and
it is Charity. Thus using humane Writers, we shall no more offend, if we rob
them of some Jewels, than these Israelites did in spoiling the Egyptians.

6. Lastly, concerning the words, (that Moses was very great in the Land of
Egypt in the sight of Pharaohs servants, and in the sight of the people.) They
first answer the Question, why Pharaoh did not kill Moses? Even because he
durst not, in respect of the opinion held of him by the multitude, as often is
said in the Gospel, they forbear to do such things, because they feared the
people, besides, the secret ouer-ruling hand of God. Again, they show how God
can make his servants dreadful, and honored of as many as he will,
notwithstanding any contempts offered them by others. Yea, so he honored Moses
here, as Stories say, Pharaohs Daughter was accounted in the number of the
Gods, for bringing such a man up. Thirdly, they show, that, as the wicked
stand in awe of God often, and outwardly profess affection to him, yet do not
submit themselves to his Will; so (often) are his servants honored also of men
with an inward conceit of them, that they are honest men, when yet their
Doctrine will not be yielded unto. So does God inwardly imprint their own
damnation in their hearts, making them void of all excuse, in not obeying
them, whom they did approve for Gods grace in them, and with them. Remember
what you read in the Gospel, of Herod touching John Baptist, namely, that
Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and reverenced
him, Mark. 9. 20.
and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. Many things,
says the Text, not all things, for he would not put away his brothers wife
for all the reverence he bare to John: and therefore in himself he condemned
himself by this reverence, etc.

The 3. Part.
1. THe third general Head of this Chapter, I said, was the Plague it self
denounced, Wherein (first) we may consider the time; namely, that it was in
the night. For at midnight, said God, I will go forth into Ver. 4.
the midst of Egypt, and all the first borne in the Land of Egypt shall die.
Why in the night? but that we might learn how as well in the night as in the
day the Lord executes both judgment and mercy. Judgment, as we see in Joshua
his direction against Ai, whereby their fearful Joshua. 8. 3.
overthrow followed: Many thousands of them being devoured by the sword, and
their City consumed with fire: So when they slept, the wrath of God waked and
marched toward them speedily. So again the five Kings in the night God
directed his servant against them, who came Joshua. 10. 9. 10.
upon them suddenly, and destroyed them with a great slaughter. Thou fool,
this night shall they take away thy soul, and then whose are all these, etc?
Other Kingdoms and Countries about us what fearful night-cries they have
had, when we slept in peace, wisdom and thankfulness should consider. Then for
mercies in like manner you see the Scriptures. Solomon had that comfortable 1.
Kings. 3. 5.
conference with God in the night, wherein God granted him the thing he sought
for, appearing to him in a Dream, and so forth, as you read there. Daniel in
the night found Dan. 2. 19.
mercy with God to have the Kings dream revealed unto him. Peter in the night
was delivered from danger: and Acts. 12. 8. Acts. 16. 25.
Paul and Silas in the night singing a Psalm, found the comfort there spoken
of. So both judgment and mercy wake and walk in the night. The use whereof
unto us should be ever to stir us up both to gee to bed as we ought, and to
use the night as the godly have done. For the first take David's example, I will
lay me down and take my rest, Psalm. 4. 8.
for it is thou Lord only that make me dwell in safety. And for the
second, he also in many Psalms may instruct you. For every night, says he in
one Psalm, wash I my Psalm. 6. 6.
bed, and water my couch with tears: yea, I make my bed swim with tears, for
so will the words bear, which David did not for any pusillanimitie, or
weakness: (for you know he was a man of a valiant courage:) but only out of
a sweet feeling that he had in his night meditation of the great goodness of
GOD toward him many ways, and his own too great inabilitie to do to him
again for the same, as he desired. And what better time can we take to
plough-vp the fallowe ground of our hearts before him, and to consider his
favors and our faults, opening even all our woes and griefs unto him? that as
the night naturally is moist and showrie more than the day; so we likewise may
raine-downe abundance of tears, praying for our sins, and thanking him for
his goodness, knowing it as a most assured truth, that no dew of the night can
so glad the earth, as this sweet moisture of thy wet eye in these respects
does please thy God. Good therefore was that Counsel of a most honorable
Father to his Child, that above all other times he should have a care in the
quiet night to talk with his God. David goes Psalm. 119. 55.
on in another Psalm, and says, I have thought upon the Lord in the night
season, and remembered him when I was waking. At midnight will I rise to give
thanks to 62. Psalm. 77. 6.
Thee, because of thy righteous Judgments. In the night I commune with mine
own heart, and search out my Spirits. With my soul have I desired thee in the
night, says Esaias. 26. 9.
the Song of the Faithful. And all these things should be our instruction. In
Job it is said, God gives songs in the Job. 35. 10.
night, and it is a Place much to be thought on. Therefore I say again since
mercy and judgment thus stir in the night, the one for his children, the
other for his Enemies, awake thou that sleep in most dull security, going
to thy bed as the Dog to his kennell, without any thought either of God, or
of Devil. Full little know thou what may happen unto thee before it be day.
It may be with thee as with these first borne, with the five Kings, with the
City Ai, etc. Thy self may be dead, thy houses on fire, thy goods spoiled,
thy children destroyed, and a thousand woeful miseries upon thy friends.
Wherefore, go to bed with prayer, awake with prayer, and arise with prayer.
Let God and grace be in thy first thoughts, and not anger and wrath, not Sheep
and Oxen, not money and mucke, which shall all perish with thee when God is
angry. We see how the faithful have done before us, and let it suffice in
this point concerning the time when this plague was executed.

2. The second thing is the Plague it self, which was the death of the first
borne. To make use of it to our selves let us consider, how great a grief it
is to have any child die; and that to have the eldest and first borne to die
is commonly a grief much greater; but yet this was not all the grief of the
Egyptians. For besides the particular grief of any one, to have it general
through the whole Land, and not to know whether God would there stay, or
extend his wrath upon them all (for they said we all shall die) Exodus 12. 33.
this was a thing most full of fear and woe. So by all these circumstances the
judgment was terrible upon them, and to them, past our feeling and conceit,
except the Lord assist our understanding and feeling. But why, will some say,
seeing we all owe a death to God first or last, young and old, and all
degrees? I answer, that death (in it self) to any grounded upon God is
neither hurtful, nor fearful (yet Nature is Nature when the separation
comes, and we are allowed to mourn for them that die:) but when death
comes with a circumstance or show of Gods anger in manner, or suddenness,
or such like, then is there not that comfort which we otherwise have. For
Example sake, Lot knew well his wife must die, but to see her changed so
suddenly and strangely into a pillar of Genesis 19.
Salt, was very fearful and discomfortable both to him and all her friends.
Those sons of Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, their Father knew full well must have
a death, but to see them both together suddenly slain by a fire from Leuit.
10. 2. Numb. 16. 32.
God, judge in your heart what grief it was. Corah, Dathan, and Abiram must
have died, and no friend of theirs but well knew it, yet to have the earth
open and swallowe them up with all their families, O what a dreadful spectacle
was it? Add unto these those Tormentors which died with the flames flashing out
of the fiery furnace, Dan. 3. 22.
where into they had cast the three servants of God; those Accusers of Daniel,
who were cast into the Lions den, Dan. 6. 24.
and shaken in pieces ere they came to the ground; Ananias and Saphira his wife
suddenly smitten by the hand of Acts. 5, 5. 10.
God. This Pharaoh here and so many of his Nobles and people drowned and
overwhelmed in the Red Sea, were Exodus 14, 26, 17 28.
they not all full of woe and grief to friends, more than if they had died
orderly without any such circumstance of Gods anger? Surely they were. And the
best Learned are of opinion that David so doubled his cry for Absolon, more in
regard of the manner of his death, than of the death 2. Sam. 18, 33.
it self. For he died in rebellion against his natural Father and King, he
was hanged by the hair of his head betwixt Heaven and Earth in a tree, till
his enemies came 9.
and stabbed him through again and again: There were no signs known of his
repentance. Which all laid together 14.
and considered of a wise Father, made his heart turn and ouerturne within
him, crying, O my son Absolon, my son, my son Absolon: would God I had
died for thee, O Absolon, my son, my son! Conclude 33.
we therefore that though naturally we must all die, and there is nothing more
sure; yet either the kind of death, or the suddennes may deprive friends of
much comfort. So was it here in Egypt for these first borne in every house.

3. But yet you will not judge (may some say) all that die a sudden or
extraordinary death. No indeed. For things revealed belong to us, and the
Lords secrets appertain to himself. The Lords mercy is restrained neither to
time, nor manner: and the Apostle says, what shall or can separate a man or
woman once grafted into Christ? Shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution,
or Romans 8. 35.
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? No, no. Neither death, nor life, nor
Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, 38. 39.
nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature can do it. No suddainnes of death then or extraordinary manner which
may happen to the best, either by natural causes in their bodies, or
otherwise, as God shall please in his unsearchable wisdom. But in such cases
we are to remember (for our comfort) what Testimonies of Faith and Religion, of
virtue and piety, they gave in their life time, and to rest upon those. The
Lord is no Changeling, but loves to the end whom he once loved, although
suddenly they depart, and say nothing. Nevertheless we entreat the Lord (if
it may be his blessed will) to deliver and save us from sudden death, and to
give us speech, memory, and hearing to our last breath. Because ye Last part
is all in all of this transitory life, and In morte non est locus
vicissitudini.
being once gone cannot be restored again (as a Carpenter can pull down his
house, if he dislike it, and make it new again.) Also, because it fares with
us in this point, as with the Archer, who though he aim at the mark never
(...).
so right, and draw up his ^owe never so steadfastly; yet, if his loose be not
good, but his hand starteth aside and swarueth at the point, he misseth. So we
in death (which is our last loose) not guided by Gods holy Spirit, may mar all.
And therefore we pray and ever should pray, that till our end, and in our end
the Lord would uphold us in our strength, and give us a gracious departure in
him. For, as for that vain Fable of help after death in Purgatory, it served
to rake up the fat of the earth to those idle bellies, and to shift away (with
fair words and promises) those poor souls that shaked and quaked after all
their works, not finding any sufficiency in them to appease Gods wrath; who
could never return being once dead, to tell them they lied in so teaching the
people that Masses and Trentalls could help after death. But for us, we know
the Scriptures; that, as the tree falls either toward the North, or toward
the South, in the place it falls, there it shall be. Heaven we read of,
and Hell we read of, but a Third place we find not. Lazarus was carried into
Heaven, and the rich Glutton into Hell. They that have done well, says the
Catholic Faith, shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done
evil, into everlasting fire. There is no Third place there mentioned to be
believed, and it is the Catholic Faith, which except every man keep holy and
undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. Let counterfeit
Catholics hold what they list, they hear the danger. S. Augustine agreeably
heereunto says, Repentance is only in this life. S. Cyprian also, Hic vel
accipimus, vel amittimus vitam aeternam, Here we either hold, or loose life
eternal, meaning that if we die well, we hold it; and if we die ill, we
loose it, there being no more help after death. S. Basil again pretily says,
Post mercatum solutum nullus negociatur, After the Market is ended there is
neither buying nor selling; and, when I am dead, the Market is ended with me.
Wherefore, let all our care be to take time while time serves, to live well
and do well according to the rule prescribed and not according to our fancies
or any man's invention, that a good life may have a good death, in Gods great
mercy and goodness. Then, for the place, leave it to God, as also the manner:
and remember well, that from every Kingdom and Country, from every Town and
house, yea from all corners and places whatsoever, there is a ready way to
Heaven. To which agrees that pretty Conference betwixt the Husbandman and the
Sayler; wherein the Husbandman asked, whether ye Sailors father lived, or no?
he answered, no. Where died he, said ye Husbandman? At sea, says ye Sailer.
And where your Grandfather? At sea also. And where your great Grandfather? At
sea, still says the Sailer. Good Lord! (then says the Husbandman) and do not
you fear to go to sea, since so many of your Ancestors died there? I pray you,
says the Sailer, let me likewise know of you, before I answer you, whether
your Father live, or no? and he answered, no. Where then died he? In his bed,
says the Husbandman. And where your Grandfather, and Great Grandfather? In
their beds also, (says he) I thank God. And, good Lord! (then says the
Sayler) are not you also afraid to go to bed, since so many of your Ancestors
died there? So, one Question quit another wittily; and both of them should
teach us, that no place can hurt a settled Christian; but, as well from Sea as
Land, the Lord can give a gracious passage to his Kingdom, which hea in mercy
grant us ever.

4. In the death of the first borne Note again the degrees of Gods punishments
in these plagues. First, he touched their water, sent them Frogs, Flies,
Lice, and such other things, grievous indeed, but not so near them as their
goods. Secondly, the Lord touched their goods: A greater plague than the
former, yet not so near them as their own bodies. Thirdly, therefore he
touched their very bodies by biles and blisters, botches and sores, very
grievous and ugly, yet he spared their lives. But now, when all the former
would not serve, he comes to life it self, Ver. 5.
and smites all their first borne, that there was no house wherein was not
death, and that of the dearest. What may we then see but a continual increasing
of Gods wrathful scourges and rods, as long as we shall spurn against him,
and not obey his holy will? Let it touch us and turn us, awake us and warn us
to take up betimes. How long we have followed our own ways, and cast behind
us the ways of God, the Lord knows well and we must also consider. What
crosses and losses have likewise been imposed upon us hitherto, should be
remembered. For they have all been Gods messengers as these plagues were to
Pharaoh, to draw us to obedience, and if they will not serve, the Lord will
write (as some Judges do) ad grauiora; that is, the Lord will increase his
wrath, as he did here, till it come to very life it self. Which being once
lost in his displeasure, the soul also is lost with the body, and both of them
sent to during woe for ever. Urge him then no further, as this cursed Pharaoh
did, but to day if you will hear his voice, turn unto him in true amendment
of life, and he shall turn unto you in mercy and love eternal.

5. Yea Sir, God may happily deal thus with some poor people for example
sake, but he will regard the better sort of men and women who are of reputation
in the world, and not bring these heavy things upon them. But no (says your
Chapter here) for this plague must light upon all sorts, from the first borne
of Pharaoh which sits upon the throne, unto the first borne of the
Maid-seruant that grindeth at the Mill, yea, the Lord will not spare the very
beasts. No honors therefore or riches, no friends or strength, no pomp or
port in this world may defend from him, but he will smite all degrees, and
therefore let all degrees profit by it. He will bring down the mighty from
their seats, and cast even Crowns unto the dust. Gold and Silver are dross
before him, and nothing can help, but a reformed heart. The sacrifice of God
is a troubled spirit, A broken and a contrite heart the Lord shall never
despise. Trust to this, but bid all earthly Titles stand aloof, for they will
not serve.

6. Then there shall be a great cry throughout all the Land of Egypt, such as
was never none like, nor shall be. This is a consequent of Gods Plagues ever
wheresoever they light, Cries and great Cries, woes and great woes. But shall
any good Child offend his Heavenly Father, till he force him to make him cry?
Shall we not think of the days of truth and peace, till we hear in every
corner of the street, kill, kill? God forbid. To learn by other men's harms
was ever yet accounted wisdom, and therefore let these Egyptian Cries so cry
in our ears and our hearts continually, as our own Cries (through the mercy
of a gracious God) may never be heard any where.

7. But against the children of Israel shall not a Dog move his tongue,
neither against man nor beast, that you may know how the Lord puts a
difference between the Egyptians and Israel. A blessed separation, by a sweet
Father! able to kindle in our hearts, if we be alive, a burning flame of love
and duty toward such a God. The like we saw in the plague of moraine, and
the plague of darkness before, the Cattle of the Israelites were safe, and they
had light wheresoever they were. So still, and so ever, if you mark the
Scriptures, one way or other. Betwixt the old world, and his servant Noe, what
a difference was there put? Betwixt Lot and Sodom, how did the Lord
distinguish? When God sent Joseph before to provide for his Father against that
Great future famine, did he not put a difference betwixt his own, and others?
When the Shunammite was so mercifully admonished of ye dearth to come, and
willed to go soiourne where she might to prevent the danger, and when she
came back again so to help her to her Land with all the mean profits by
such accident of the Kings talk with Gehazi, and her fit 2. Kings, 8.
coming in with her Petition while they were talking, who sees not the finger
of a sweet GOD putting a difference between the Israelites and the Egyptians?
that is, betwixt his own, and others? In that Great destruction of Jerusalem,
had he not a little Pella by to save such as it pleased him to pull out of that
fire? Let us then never fear, we see he has care of his own, and what he
will do, he can do. If it be good for us to escape these worldly woes, we
are as sure we shall, as we are sure we live. And if otherwise it please him
to wrap us with others in the outward punishment, yet shall we ever be sure to
be distinguished from them in the eternal pain; and those outward griefs
shall be but means to lead us to lasting joys. O cleave we then fast unto
him, for you see the difference of being Religious, and being profane, of
leuing the Word, and loathing the exercises of the same. And this difference
here will make a fearful difference in the world to come, when you cannot
help it, had you the treasure of all the earth to purchase your ease withal.
No not one drop of water to cool your scalded tongue, shall you be able to get
with all that ever you possessed in this world, for the love whereof (against
all Admonitions) you have lost your self for ever.

8. Lastly, more power again you see of this mighty God in the 8. verse,
where he made the rebellious heart to stoop, and to seek with entreaty what
before could not be had with any petition. All thy servants (says Moses) shall
come down unto me, and fall before me, saying, Get thee out, and all the
people that are at thy feet. They shall seek and sue, beg and crave
prostrate before him, that with speed they would depart. O glorious God, that
can thus humble thy foes and make them fall before them whom erst they
scorned. Let it knit us and glue us unto thee for ever. I am amazed at thy
Mercy, and I cannot speak what I think. Lord, increase our faith and it shall
suffice, and be well with us.

CHAP. 12.
The general Heads of this Chapter are chiefly three. The Institution of the
Passover. The Execution of the former plague. The Departure of the Israelites
out of Egypt.


1. Observe first the words in the second ver. 2.
verse: This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be to you
the first month of the year. And herein remember how diversely diverse Nations
and people have made the beginning of the year. Some, when the Spring began.
Some, at the Summer Solstitium, or Stay of the Sun. 8 Calends of July.
Some at the Winter Stay. And some from the Autumn 8. Calends of Ian.
or Harvest time, which usually is reckoned from the sixth of August. The old
Romans (as did ye Hebrews) began their year in March. Which order seems
most agreeable to Nature, because all things then begin to revive and show
forth their life and vigor. In regard whereof, some are of opinion, that the
time of ye Creation of all things was then, and that the Names of our Months,
September, October, November, December, are, as if it were said, the 7. the 8.
the 9. and the 10. from March, making March the first, and so reckoning from
thence forward. But for other policies the Jews reckoned also from September:
Read Josephus in his Antiquities, Chap. 4. and Hierome upon ye 3. of Ezechiel,
etc. With us in England the usual Reckoning is from the 1. day of January
which we call New-yeeres day, yet the Merchants among us usually begin from ye
25. of March. So several places have several Customs, and we must leave them.

2. Touching the Passover. The Name in Hebrewe is well expressed in English
for our understanding, when it is called the Passover, not the passing over
into the Land of Promise, nor the passing over the Red Sea, whereof see S.
Augustine; but the Lords passing over, or the Angels Aug. tract. 55. in John.
passing over those houses, which had the posts striked with the blood.
Therefore in the 11. verse it is expreslie called the Lords Passover, and so
Leuit. 23. 5. The time of the Institution was before their Deliverance, because
ver. 3.
things taught in affliction both better sink in us, and longer are remembered
of us. The Place where it was eaten now was in Egypt, but after they were come
into the Land of Promise, and settled, we read in Deuteronomy. thus. Thou Deuteronomy. 16. 5.
may not offer the Passover within any of the gates which the Lord thy GOD
gives thee? But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his
Name there, etc. Which place being at Jerusalem all resorted thither at this
Feast, and since Jerusalem has been destroyed, they have not dared, write
some, to offer else where.

3. The manner of this Passover, with the signification of every thing, is
next to be thought of. Where you see first a meek Creature, so was Christ; it
was a Lamb, a harmless creature, so was Christ; a profitable creature (by
wool to cloth us, and flesh to feed us) so was Christ; his righteousness
covers and his flesh feeds all those that truly believe in him. That this
Paschal Lamb was a figure of Christ, remember John's words in ye Gospel: But
when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his
legs, that it might be fulfilled, not a bone of him shall be broken. Words
written in this Chapter, ver. 46. of the Paschal Lamb: and so John makes this
a fore-shewing of that, and that a true fulfilling of this. In like sort does
S. Paul, when he says, Our Passover is offered up, speaking of Christ. If
the Family were too little to Ver. 4.
eat a whole Lamb, then must they take their neighbors next unto them to
make a fit number. Whereby was noted and figured, that Christ is not divided
into diverse houses and families, kingdoms and Countries, but he does unite and
gather diverse houses and Nations to make one Church, even as here many did
eat one Lamb. A comfortable Figure, and worthy often remembrance. We may not
divide the Lamb, but we must gather our selves to the Lamb, and that is the
true Church, where people are so gathered. Be sure then of the Lamb, and not
of the place where the Lamb once was, but now is not; and feed Succession of
Place. Succession of Doctrine.
upon this Lamb, in manner prescribed; that is, believe in Christ according to
the Scriptures, and be sure you are right: other notes may deceive you, this
will not. And if as yet you be not thus gathered, make no longer stay in so
dangerous an estate, but be reformed, and bless God for his Truth.

4. Your Lamb shall be without blemish, says the next Ver. 5.
verse: first, to prefigure the purity and vnspottednes of Christ free and
clean from all sin. And secondly, to teach that a more excellent ransom was
to be had to save man from sin, than in all mankind was to be found, which
wholly was sinful. In Apish imitation of which immaculate purity our profound
Romists take great care that their Cake be whole, round and sound, not bitten,
nor broken, but without blemish, as this Paschal Lamb was: giving themselves
rather to abolished Ceremonies, than to the teaching of Christ now come, in
whom these Ceremonies had end. It must be a Male, not a female; thereby
figuring the spiritual strength of Christ, according to which the Prophet Esaias
spoke of him before, That he Esaias. 53. 12.
should divide the spoil with the strong, and that great number of Angels
about the throne, even thousand thousands, saying, that he is worthy to
receive power, and riches, Apoc. 5. 12.
and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and praise. Thirdly, the
Lamb must be of a year old, thereby to prefigure our Saviors experience of
infirmities and miseries, which even a days continuance in this wretched world
yields both to man and beast, much more a year. Of which the Prophet also
foretold, when Espy. 53. 3.
he said of Christ, He is a man full of sorrows, and has experience of
infirmities: Surely he has borne our infirmities, 4.
and carried our sorrows, etc. Read over the whole Chapter. Whereunto the
Apostle agrees again, when Heb. 4. 15.
he says, We have not a High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling
of our infirmities: but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without
sin. The comfort and use whereof follows in the next verse. Therefore 16.
let us go boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need. And indeed a Comfort of comforts it is,
that in his own body and our true Nature, it pleased him thus to taste our
woes. For he did it only that we might be assured of his knowledge and love,
that he both knows our case better than we can express it; and in his love
toward us, will help and succor us as shall be fit. Fourthlie, ye shall take
it of the Lambs, or of the Kids, says the Text, To shadow out how Christ
should be taken from amongst the stock of sinful men, from whom he descended
without sin, as appears by the Scripture.

5. And you shall keep it unto the 14. day of this Month, Ver. 6.
(from the 10. day wherein it was taken.) Whereby Two things chiefly were
figured. First, that Christ should not by and by suffer after he was borne, but
live and abide a certain time in the world, and then die, even as this Lamb
taken up the 10. day, was not killed till the 14. day. All which, we know, was
fulfilled accordingly, he being at the time of his Passion about thirty and
three years old. Secondly, it both served to prepare their hearts to the
right eating of it, being a Remembrance before their eyes those 4. days
before; and also to prefigure unto us with what meditation and preparation we
ought ever unto our lives end, come to the eating of the true Passover
(whereof this Lamb was but a shadow) in that holy Sacrament which is left
unto us, as a Remembrance of his See Beda in Exodus 11. and Galasius in Exodus
12. upon these words. Radolph. lib. 10. in Leuit. cap. 1. and lib. 16. cap. 2.
Passion for mankind. Other conceits have some Writers, which I omit; only I
will remember His words that says, Decimo quarto die immolabatur, quia tunc
plenilunium est, and Luna recepta luminis sui plenitudine Sole iam occidente in
Orient consurgit, quia morienti Christo, Sole iustitiae, Ecclesia (quae in
Luna intelligitur) ad vitam consurgit, etc. The 14. day this Lamb was offered,
because then the Moon being at full, and rising in her full light when the
Sun was set, thereby might be shadowed that the Church (usually signified
by the Moon) rises with light and to light that ever shall endure in great
fulness after the setting of the Sun, that is, by the death of Christ the true
Sun both of light and life to all that faithfully believe in him.

6. It was to be killed at night; and why at night more than any other time?
Surely, to note and remember unto them always the time of their Deliverance
out of Egypt, which was in the night. Again, it might shadow out the time of
Christ his coming in the flesh which was (as it were) in the Evening of the
world, that is, in the last times, 1. Cor. 10. In regard whereof (as some have
noted) many of his mercies and miracles were showed upon men in the Evening or
toward Evening as when it is said in the Gospel, When the Even was come,
they Matt. 8. 16.
brought unto him many that were possessed with Devils, and he cast them out,
etc. Likewise, in Mark, when Mark. 1. 32.
Even was come, at what time the Sun sets they brought to him all that
were diseased, and he healed them. Thus showing by the time of Evening that he
was indeed that health of mankind, which in the latter time should come.

7. The blood was to be sprinkled and striked upon Ver. 7. and. 22 Ver. 27.
the door posts with a bunch of Hyssope; that it might be a sign for the Lord
to pass over their houses by, when he executed wrath upon the Egyptians. Non
quod incorporea natura huiusmodi signis egeret; sed quia conueniebat, vt per
symbolum intelligerent illi prouidentiam Dei etc. Not that God had any need of
such signs; but that by such outward means it was comfortable to them to
know, and be assured of Gods providence for their safety, says Theodoret. And
it figutatiuely showed the effect and virtue Quest in Exodus 24.
of Christ's blood the true paschal Lamb ever to save from the destroying
Angel, as many as should be sprinkled with it, that is, should make particular
application of it to themselves. For it is not the blood without sprinkling
will help: Christ dying for all sufficiently, but Sufficientur, non
efficatetur.
not effectually, because all take not hold of the fruit of him.

8. It was to be eaten roast with fire, not raw, nor Ver. 7. and 8.
boiled or sodden in water. ^ery aptly shadowing the bitter passion which our
Savior should endure, being indeed tormented in the most cruel manner they
could, Cuius corpus acerbissimis cruciatibus in cruce inassat^m ac Galas. in
Exodus
veluti torrefactuus errat: Whose body was roasted, and (as it were) broyled
with bitter cruelties of despite and pain. Also, it must be eaten with
unleavened bread, that such bread might put them ever in remembrance of the
sudden and hasty manner of their deliverance, when they were forced to carry
their dough unleavened upon their backs. ver. 34. Again, because Leaven
signifies both corrupt Doctrine, and corrupt manners, Math. 16. 12. Therefore
by unleavened bread was taught and shadowed that we must abstain from both,
if we will be worthy partakers of Christ in the Sacrament. Seven days
together to eat such bread, ver. 15. 19. 20. represented unto them how serious
and continued their meditation should be of such a Great mercy, as their
Deliverance was. And if they so of the shadow, what we of the truth, namely of
our Deliverance from Hell, death, Devil, and damnation? Is a light short and
perfunctorie Remembrance of these things once (at Easter) enough for a
Christian man or woman? no, no, and therefore carry another care with you, or
else be assured, it will be easier for the Jew than for you in that day.

9. It was to be eaten with sower herbs, to represent again the sowernes of
the passion of Christ Jesus, whose gripes and touching woes the Evangelists set
out in many words: as, that his soul was heavy unto the death, his cries
strong, O Father, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me, his
prayer so vehement, his agony so great, that blood for sweat burst out of his
face, and an Angel was sent to comfort him. Were not these sower herbs? etc.
Others think they were willed to use these herbs to put themselves ever in
mind of their sower estate in the Land of Egypt under Pharaoh and his
Officers, out of all which misery they were delivered by a gracious God;
either the one use, or the other was fit.

10. Nothing must be reserved till the morning; but if ver. 10.
any were left, it was to be burned with fire: to show both literally and
mystically, that both they and all true believers should be fully delivered;
they out of Egypt, and both they and all the Faithful out of sins Bondage by
ye true Paschal Lamb. Wherefore, as then it should have been a grievous
transgression to reserve part and not wholly to eat it, making a division of
that which ought to be whole; so now is it as odious, and damnable before God,
to receive the Bread, and not the Cup, as Popery teaches to do; or, to
affirm that Christ has freed us from original sin, but left us to our
selves to make satisfaction for our other sins, partly in this life, and
partly in Purgatory. For this is not to eat the Lamb whole, but to make a
division, and to reserve part till the morning. Their Apish burning also of
their consecrated Hosts (upon occasion) may here be thought upon; and more and
more their absurd imitations of these Mosaicall Ceremonies be noted. Praecepit
prius numeros sufficientes ad esum Agni simul imolare pascha; docens eos
fraternam charitatem and miserecordiam erga pauperes. Iam admonet vt reliquiae
carnium comburantur, nec seruentur in posterum diem; hoc pacto compelleus illos
accersere egenos ad festum communiter celebrandum. Deinde, quod vetat carnium
quippiam relinqui in crastinum, sic intelligimus, quod futura vita symbolis non
indiget, ipsas enim res tunc intuebimur. He commanded before, says
Theodoret, a sufficient number to eat the Passover; teaching them thereby
brotherly Charity and mercy to the poor. Now he admonishes, that what was
left should be burned, and not reserved till the next day; so (as it were)
compelling them to call the poor and needy to them. Again, in that nothing
must be left till the morrow, we may understand by it, how in the life to
come there shall be no use of signs, for as much as we shall behold the things
themselves. Now, ye paschal Lamb, we know, was a sign. etc.

11. They must eat it with their loins girt, their shoes ver. 11.
on their feet, their staves in their hands, etc. That is, they must eat it
like passengers and travelers ready to depart: figuring so in show, that
whosoever is a right Eater of the true paschal Lamb Christ Jesus by believing
on him, he must not stick down his staff in this world, and say in his
heart, It is good being here: but he must ever esteem him self as a pilgrim,
and stranger; have his loins girt, his Luke. 12. 35.
shoes on, and his staff in his hand, ready to depart when the Lord calls
without any looking back unto Sodom, and sinful cleaving to this wicked
world, for we have not here an abiding City. Which how they do, who make
this world their GOD, much more thinking of it both by day and night than they
do of God, would be thought of whilst there is time to amend the fault.
Surely this kind of men and women eat not the passover as they ought, and
therefore their danger is great. Note also (by the way) how He says, it was
the Lords passover, when it was but a Sign of his passing over, like unto
that Genesis 17. ver. 13. with many more. Whether they sat or stood, if you
ask? I take it to be out of Question, that they stood: but afterward (when
they were delivered) they sat, as we read of Christ with his Disciples. To
give a reason whereof, some say, that it was the manner of servants to stand; of
freemen to sit; and therefore they now stood, as a token of their bondage and
servitude in Egypt: but afterward (being delivered) they sat in token of their
freedom. Yet I rather think that they after sat, because they used (after ye
passover eaten) to take their own Supper, and to bid the poor to them,
thankfully distributing Gods gifts, and rejoicing for Gods great mercies to
them. We kneel at our eating, and it is the fittest and most seemly manner
for us, offering to God our prayers and thanksgiving, as we do. When (in the
12. verse) God said, I will execute judgment upon all the Gods of Egypt, S.
Hierome reports it out of the Hebrew Writers, that in the very same night
they departed out of Egypt, Omnia Egypti templa destructa fuisse, sine terrae
motu, sieve iactu fulminum, All the Temples of Egypt were ouer-throwne, either
with earthquakes, or thunderbolts. Sed vlterius referu^t Hebraei, eade^ nocte
lignea Idola putrefacta fuisse, metallica resoluta and fusa, lapidea comminuta.
But farther also these Hebrewe Writers say, that in the same night all the
wooden Images were rotten, all the metal Images were dissolved and moulten,
and all the stone Images broken. Which surely were great works and Judgments,
if they were so.

12. And in the first day shall be an holy assembly: also Ver. 16.
in the seventh day, etc. Where we see the lawful end and use of Holy Days;
namely, to Remember the mercies and favors of God, and to give him thanks,
w^e being by our corruption too forgetful. As for that of S. Paul, You
observe days and times, etc. It does not condemn Holy Days by lawful
Authority ordained for the ends above said: but Superstition and confidence
in the work. For well knew S. Paul, these and the like days observed in the
law with Gods good liking. We see also the Reverence of such kind of meetings
by ye title given them, of Holy assemblies: and, How monstrously we abuse them,
when we make them drunken assemblies, and cursed assemblies, by reason of all
kind of riot and abomination used at them! A fearful abuse if our hearts
were flesh to feel it: fitter for Heathens and Pagans and Devils incarnate,
than for Christian people that profess God, and say they look to be saved by
Christ. For can we say in our consciences, when we come home, that we have kept
an Holy assembly unto the Lord on these days? ask but your self that
Question, and I trust there will much amendment follow of it. Mark also how
God accepts dressing of our meat, and allows it to us on these days,
still considering (in his mercy) our necessity. But yet so we ought to dress
meat, that ever we have a care of ye Salvation of the^ that dress it: who
being created and redeemed as we our selves be, ought not so evermore to be
kept at this service, as yt never they may hear the word, receive the
sacraments, and praise God in the congregation with his people. For that should
be to cat the flesh of the^, and to drink ye blood of them most cruelly, yea to
bury them in our bellies: and for our bodies to destroy their souls for ever.
Rather remember David's refusal to drink the water that was bought so dear;
and provide 2. Sam 23. 16
so, that the one being done, the other may not be left undone. Which may, if
they go to Church by turns, or if your estate be such, by having exercise of
these duties before they begin their work in the morning, or before they
dress supper in the evening. This holy Care in you shall greatly please God,
and be a comfort to your conscience in your place as to the Apostle in his,
that you are free from the blood of your servants, free I say from the guilt of
casting them away for the fleshly feeding of your body.

13 Then Moses called all the Elders of Israel, and said ver 21.
unto them, Choose out and take you for every of your households a Lamb, and
kill the Passover, etc. What God had spoken to him he now speaks to ye
people. See therefore (in it) the office and authority of the Minister, What
he has received, that to deliver, calling and requiring his people to come
together to hear it, and if he cannot conveniently have all, then at the least
the Elders and Chief, who both ought to come, and to their best ability
assist him (their Pastor and Teacher) in any thing belonging to his duty. A
fit Remembrance for these days, wherein the best are usually the worst, that
is, the Heads and guides of a Parish, the Gentlemen (if there be any) the
Freeholders, and Wealthier sort: for who wring and wrong the Minister, but
these? who insult over him, and browe beat him, but these? who look to be
lawless, and without controlement, but these? Their word must stand, not Gods
word; they must teach, and not learn; and (at a word) in steed of any
assistance and concurrence with their Preacher, as was here in these Elders
with Moses, they are the bitterest and sowrest hinderers that the Messenger and
Minister of GOD has. But does not the Lord see it, or does he see it, and not
regard it? No, no. He shall ever be true in his word, and make them one day
know and feel, that the abuse of his Minister in his service is the contempt
of him, and that 1. Sam 8. 7.
the very dust of their feet shall stand powerful before Mat. 10. 40. etc
Luke 10. 11. 16.
him against the bodies and souls of these proud despisers, to condemn them
and cast them into eternal w^^. Therefore good it were for them to take up
betimes, and to fellow the advice of Gods holy Spirit by the mouth of S. Paul
given: Obey them that have the ouer-sight of you, Heb. 13. 17.
and submit your selves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give
accounts, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
unprofitable for you. But I have not spoken these things generally, for I well
know upon my own knowledge many sweet and comfortable encouragers of their
Preachers and Ministers, both of Gentlemen and others of the better sort. Let
them that are faulty amend in Gods fear, and the other go forward to their
great praise.

14. When ye shall come into the Land, which the ver. 25.
Lord will give you, as he has promised, then you shall keep this service.
And when your children ask you, 26. 27.
what service is this you keep? Then you shall say, etc. If ever a man or
woman forget God and duty, it is most to be feared in Prosperity, when they
have obtained what they disired, and what with longing looks they expected;
or, as this Text speaks, when they are come into the Land of Promise. And
therefore fitly does Moses here admonish them, to perform this duty, and to
beware of the lulling sleep of forgetfulness: which I wish every one that
reads this Note to apply to himself, and make religious use of. For who
knows not that the heir (whilst his Father lives) is often well given,
comes to the Church, favors the Minister, distributeth to the poor,
disliketh bad servants, and ill company; yea, both in his heart thinks, and
with his mouth speaks, That if Gods will be to bring him to the Land
expected, to wit, into his Fathers Place, surely and certainly he will do
thus, and so, that is, very many good things shall flow from him. But when God
has given him his desire, who forgets like this man? who grows sluggish
and slack to come to the Church? who stands with the Minister for his due?
who beats the poor from his gate? who gets and gathers Swearers and
Swaggerers to wrong every man, but this young heir now gotten where he wished
to be? If I speak a Truth, let some feel it, and for His love, that rules
Heaven and Earth, leave it. Thus does the Scholar, that wishes a Benefice,
forget his duty when he has got it, and suffer his people (the Lords Lambs)
to perish by his sloth. Thus does the Servant, when he is become a Master:
and thus do thousands, who (when they were unmarried and had little) thought
and said, if they had some portion to live upon, some reasonable and competent
estate, O how would they serve God, and do good things to their power? But all
is forgotten, and they are not the same persons, when the Lord (in mercy) has
given them more cause to serve him, than ever they had. Follow this Meditation
farther your self, and think often in your heart what a sweet killing poison
Prosperity is to many a one, and how needful this Note of Moses was, That
they should Remember their duties to God, when they were come into that
pleasant Land of Promise.

15. The Commandment, To teach their children what the Passover meant,
notes unto us, how the Word and Sacraments should go together: not hiding in
an unknown tongue, and by neglect of preaching, what Gods ordinance is, but
plainly and openly, and ever joining Doctrine to it, that the people of God may
know the Lords meaning in his holy Sacraments, and so use them as they ought,
to his glory and their comfort. Yea, the children you see should not be brought
up in ignorance, as ours are, to the great provocation of Gods wrath against
us. But even when they are young, taught and told what a Sacrament is, and
what is meant by the Paschal Lamb: for thus would they prove good servants of
God, when years came on, and the Lord be honored in our seed when we are
dead. Which, whether it can be without a blessing from his hand, both upon them
and whatsoever we leave unto them, judge in your own soul, when you have
considered well how sweet and gracious God is, how many are his promises, and
how faithful he ever is in them. Do therefore as follows in this your
Chapter of this people; ver. 7. They bowed themselves and worshipped. That is,
they thankfully received the Lords pleasure at Moses mouth, not as the word of
man, but (as it was in deed) the Word of God: And they ver. 28.
went their way, and did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron. A blessed
obedience both in hearing and doing, a cheerful alacrity and readiness, such
as gladded the heart of Moses, and ever will glad all godly Ministers,
Chronicled here up in the Book of God by the direction of God to the lasting
praise of them that were so touched and moved to obey. God (in his mercy) make
it also profitable to thy soul, good Christian Reader, that thou likewise (in
the Book of life,) may be Chronicled up for evermore. Amen.

The second part.
1. COncerning the death of the first borne, which was ver. 29.
the second general Head noted before to be in this Chapter, that which has
been spoken before in the Denunciation may suffice, to which I refer you,
praying that here may be observed the great care of Almighty God to have this
thing well remembered, when again he thus repeateth it with all his
Circumstances of time, of persons, their awaking, their crying, their desire to
be rid of the Israelites, their forcing of them away in all have, etc. Surely
Gods works for mankind in general, or for any of us all in particular to be
forgotten, must needs be most displeasing unto him; when we see such care as
this to preserve in his church and children a due Remembrance of them.
Theodoret, speaking of these firstborn, says Cur interfecit Theodoret in
Exodus 12. 22.
primogenita Aegypti? Propterea quod Israele prmimogenita Dei Pharaoh nimis
durae subiecerat seruituti. Hoc enim ipse Dominus Deus dixit, Filius meus
primogenitus Israel, etc. Why did he slay the first borne of Egypt? Even
because Pharaoh had subjected his first borne Israel to too hard and cruel a
bondage. For thus speaks the Lord of Israel, Israel my firstborn Son,
etc. Again in this, that the firstborn only dyed both of man and beast, (not
the second-borne, nor the third-borne,) we may with profit well observe, how
the differences of children are known to God, who is first? who is second? and
who is third? which may yield this use, never (for any child) to go about
with craft and subtilty, or any unlawful invention of man, to thrust himself
into the place and prerogative thereof, which God in his providence has not
given him, but to abide in the order disposed to him of God; and to trust in
his mercy, who so disposed; for fear lest God, who knows our order, severely
punish us for breaking his order. He could have made the youngest the eldest (if
he had pleased;) and he could have made the 3. to be the 2. (if he had so
liked:) But he has not done it, and what he does is ever best, til his own
hand alter the same. A contented mind much pleases God: and a working spirit
contrary to his Will, as much offends him. Let it be thought on, for there is
too much cause in the world given, and sin is counted Wisdom.

2 This mighty power of God is fearful, and comfortable. Fearful, for that
in one night, yea, in one instant, and with one word (as it were) he destroyed
so many firstborn in Egypt. Comfortable, because what judgment soever he
uses and executes against the wicked, yet he can save his own in the very
midst of death and danger, So that not a hair of their heads shall be hurt.
Thousands may fall on the right hand, and ten Thousands on their left, yet no
harm happen to them. Also this gracious Clemency and Mercy in the Lord, is
most comfortable, who when he could as easily and as justly have destroyed all,
yet in his goodness (that has neither bottom, nor measure) he takes but the
firstborn, and so graciously humbles the^ by a few. This is that which ye
Prophet speaks when he beggeth of ye Lord, in wrath to remember Mercy: so
noting Habac. 3. 2.
his manner and nature ever full of pity, and long suffering.

3 Then Pharaoh called to Moses and Aaron, saying, get Verse. 31.
you hence, etc. That is, he sent his Messengers unto them to will them to
depart: For Moses saw him no more after the departing mentioned in the tenth
Chapter, the last verse: And in the eleventh Chapter, verse eight, you see
Moses foretold that thus his servants should entreat him to depart. Ever till
now Pharaoh had some exceptions either of their Children, or of their Cattle,
etc. But now all are put in, a liberty granted unto all, and glad and glad to
be delivered of them. Thus can God with his mighty arm bring down the proud
stomakes of the greatest, and make them yield to his Will wholly, not in part.
A fruitful consideration for those that daily amongst us use to limmit their
obedience to God; saying either openly, or secretly in their hearts, Herein
will I follow my Teacher, and herein I will not. Adultery, Murder, and such
like, be great sins; and I will forbear them: but for my swearing, my
oppressing of my Neighbors, my selling of my Benefices in my gift, my
negligence at Church and Sacraments, and such like, ye shall pardon me, I know
what is fit as well as he. Thus did Herod hear John Baptist as I have noted
before, in many Mark. 6. 20.
things, (not in all things;) and namely, not in the matter of Keeping his
Brothers wife. Now Herod and Pharaoh are but bad Exampels for a man to follow,
that has any care of his soul: And therefore (rather) fix your eye upon that
wish of God in Deuteronomy. O that there were such a heart in this people to fear me,
and to keep All my commandments, All, All always, that it might go well with
them, and with their seed for ever. This is a better Example: and he that thus
wishes, has Heaven in his right hand, to give it us if we heed it, and Hell
in his left hand, to cast us into, if we despise it. Follow this meditation by
your self farther, and beware of restraining and limiting your duty to God,
but perform all obedience as the Lord shall enable you. And if you fail in
any thing, let it be frailety in you, not headstrong boldness, for that is
dangerous. Remember also how Pharaoh here desired to be blessed of these men,
who erst were odious in his eyes. The same God can pull you down, and make you
as glad of your Pastors prayer for you, as you have been contented spitefully
and maliciously to oppose your self against him. Now is the time to think of
these things, and so to use the messenger of God, as he may ever pray for you
with an edge, that is, heartily and powerfully..

4 They tooke-vp their dough before it was leauened, Verse. 34.
and departed in haste. The Lord knows ever what is best, (have, or leisure)
for his children, and so be appoints. Lot was long before he would get-out of
Sodom, and his wife was worse than he. We are all covetous and greedy of these
worldly matters, and too loath to leave them, when we are called. Wherefore the
Lord in his great love often preuenteth such weakness in us by a sudden and
constrained haste. Be it therefore ever unto us as he will, for he is always
more careful of our good than we can be. Other things here mentioned have been
touched before, and therefore I pass them over.

The 3. part.
1. THeir departure now out of Egypt is the 3. general Head of this Chap.
concerning which it is said, that They took their journey from Ramases to
Succoth, etc. Verse. 37.
This is that Rameses which you read of in Genesis 47. ver. 11: Where Joseph
placed his father and his brethren. The number also is set down, about six
hundred thousand men of foot, beside children. A most wonderful increase
from 70. Souls, which were all that came into Egypt. And most effectually it
shows us, how able the Lord is to increase his Church, notwithstanding all
the malice of man and Devil whatsoever: Genesis 12. 21. Genesis 15. 5. I will
multiply thy seed as the sand of the Sea: and we see the truth of it. A
multitude also of sundry sorts of people went with them, following the
prosperity hoped for in the Israelites, who (they saw) were not touched with ye
plagues of Egypt: and rightly shadowing what after fell out, and ever will,
that Christ shall be followed of many for the loaves, and his Gospel embraced
for the prosperity and peace that often he vouchsafes unto it. Yet (no doubt)
some follow it for Religion and Truth sake, etc.

2 Their time of abode in Egypt is here said to be four Verse. 40.
hundred and thirty years: which how it is to be reckoned from the Promise,
see Genesis. 15. Acts. 7. 6. Galathians. 3. 17. and see Interpreters, by name
Calasius, who reckons every year in particular. Note we, and always
remember, that so careful was the Lord of his promise, as, When the 400. and
thirty years were expired, the self same day they departed, even the self
same day. Ever it may comfort us in our spiritual fears and conflicts, that
certainly the Lord will never fail in any promise, but even days and hours
of comfort fit for his Children, as they are known to him, so are they
observed of him most mercifully, most graciously, and most precisely. Why then
should not I (dust and ashes) tarry his good leisure in assured hope, and in
peace of Soul, waiting for the good hour? but I must needs tie the Lord to
my time, and to my will, or else I faint, I fall, I speak or think amiss,
That the Lord regards me not, but has forgotten me, and forsaken me, and
all that Satan my sworne-Enemy suggesteth is true. O, do it not any more,
neither ever wrong your gracious Father and dear God so much, who you see
breaks not with these Israelites one day, but the very self same day
delivers them which was appointed 400. years before. God strengthen us, for
his Son sake; for we are weak, but he is faithful for evermore.

3 Some other circumstances touching the Paschal Verse. 43. etc.
Lamb are here noted in the end of this Chapter, omitted before; namely, That
only such as were circumcised might Ver. 44. and 48.
eat of it; so figuring, that of the true Passover Christ Jesus they only
can be partakers, having their hearts circumcised and purged by faith, etc. And
being circumcised, servants might eat; showing that bond and free are alike
accepted of God. That it must be eaten in one house, signified Verse. 46.
that out of the Church Christ is not to be found. Not a bone must be broken,
which was fulfilled in our Savior Christ, as was touched before: yet here
remember Theodorets words, Ossa conterunt Agni, qui male intelligentes eloquia
Diuina, ad suam impietatem illa detorquere conantur. They may be said to break
the bones of the Lamb, who ill understanding the holy Scriptures, go about to
wrest them to their impieties. One Law must be to him that is Verse. 49.
borne in the Land, and to the stranger that dwelled among them: which
signified, that whosoever, unto the worlds end, will live in the Church, he
must and ought to be governed by the Laws of ye Church. Finally, The obedience
of the people (here mentioned) in all things to Moses and Verse. 50.
Aaron, teaches us the like obedience ever to Magistrate and Minister over us,
which the better we perform the more assured may we be that we are true
Israelites. Thus may this Chapter profit us in Gods blessing.

CHAP. 13.
The general Heads of this Chapterare chiefly these. 1. The Sanctification of
the firstborn to the Lord. 2. By what way the Lord led them. 3. The Signs of
direction vouchsafed to them.


COncerning the first; The Paschall Lamb (as has been showed) was a lively
remembrance of the Lords passing over their houses, and not slaying their
firstborn, as he did the Egyptians: yet does God here again institute, for
an other Remembrance of it, that all the firstborn should be offered to him
in sacrifice. Verse. 1.
Which plainly shows our dulnes to be so great, that either not at all, or
very slightly we remember the Lords mercies and benefits, unless by sundry
means we be raised and stirred-vp thereunto. Let us therefore think of our
selves as the Lord knows us to be, and rest ever thankful for this great
care of his over us, testified in his sundry ways and means to awake and
work in us due duties toward him, and use the same appointed means
continually and ever, as we are commanded: otherwise, we condemn both the
Lords care, and wisdom: and the punishment at last must needs be very
fearful. Let it strike all negligent hearers of the Word, all secure and
earthly contemners of the Sacraments, all that refuse to read, to confer, and
to do whatsoever else as a means that leads to the Lord. The Reason which
the Lord aleageth of this Law of the firstborn to be sanctified unto him, is,
because they were his, (for they are mine, says he.) Which does not note any
reiectio^ of the second-borne, or third, from his grace and favor, or yet tie
his mercy and liking ever to the eldest (for we know, He hated Esau, and loved
Jacob:) but we are to understand it thus, that albeit all were his indeed, yet
these firstborn he challenged to be his by a double right; both because he
had delivered them from bondage and servitude as the rest, and because he saved
them alive, and slew them not, when he killed all the firstborn in Egypt. I
make this use of it, even to think with my self, That the more God has done
for me, the more titles he has unto me, and the more I am his, and ought to be
in all the duties and services that may flow from either heart or body of so
wretched a creature. And if I do not so think, and so strive to show my
self, even so many witnesses against me are his sundry mercies to me, and I
shall be destroyed. The ends then of this Law of sanctifying the firstborn unto
the Lord, were these; To be a Remembrance of their deliverance; To be a
witness of the Lords right to them, and over them, whom he had so graciously
and mightily delivered (even as an earthly Lord seeks a penny or a Rose for an
acknowledgment of his right, not for any increase of his wealth:) That the
Priests might have hereby a maintenance to live to preserve doctrine and
knowledge among them; That Christ hereby might be lively shadowed and showed,
who being the firstborn, was offered-vp a holy and sufficient sacrifice for
all our sins, etc.

The Law of Redemption of the children, ver. 13. 15. was to mittigate the
rigor of the Law, if they should have dyed; and still shows, how sweet and
merciful the Lord is. Afterward, the Levites were taken in their place; and
the Redemption of the unclean beasts teaches us, that God will have his due,
if not by sacrificing them (because they were unclean,) yet by a price for
them, or by their death. Which all wicked Robbers of God in his Tithes and
Offerings may make an use of: and cease so to offend any more, if admonition
may find place with them. Other things have been touched before, as the
unleavened bread, the instructing of their children and such like; wherefore I
pass them over. The frontlets spoken of in the 16. verse (being for
Remembrance) ver. 16.
the Jews afterward abused and had their Philacteries, etc. As our Papists
have sundry superstitious things about their necks and arms, to put them in
mind of I know not what.

The 2. part.
1 COncerning the way by which GOD led them, you see here in the 17. verse
what is said; namely, Ver. 17.
That God carried them not by the way of the Philistims Country (though it were
nearer,) lest any should repent when they saw war, and turn again to Egypt.
Si enim cum longius esset (Numb. 14) regredi voluerunt, quid si tam vicini
essent? For if, when they were farther of, they would have returned (Numb. 14.)
what, when they were so near? (says Saint Cyril:) wherein behold a most
singular Testimony of Gods fatherly care over our infirmities, in not
suffering us to be farther tried, than in him, and through him we shall be able
to endure, and at the last to overcome also, according to the most gracious
promise specified by the Apostle. 1. Cor. 10. 12. Let a troubled Spirit ever
think upon this, and even feed upon it to the comfort of Soul, as one would
feed upon sweet and pleasing meat, for the good of body. Your weakness is
known to God; and (as you see here) he thinks before hand what you can
bear, and what you cannot; what will lead you to the Land of promise, and what
will make you turn back to Egypt; and had he not strength in store for you in
his good time to be given you, thereby to overcome the troubles you now are in,
whatsoever they are, spiritual or worldly, in such sort as he knows to be
best; truly he would have prevented them, and never have suffered you to fall
into them, more then he would suffer here the Israelites to pass by the
Country of the Philistims; for he is not the God of the Israelites alone, but
your God and my God also; no respecter of persons, but sweet to all that
cleave unto him. And therefore since these things are thus now with you, rest
in hope, and be cheerful; there is a good hour coming, assure your self,
wherein his strength shall appear and give you victory, these things turning
to your good, and not to your harm. For, even as an Eagle fluttereth over her
birds, stretches out her wings, takes them and bears them upon her wings:
so does the Lord for his people, says the Song of Moses: and let it comfort
you, for God is true. Deuteronomy. 32. 11.


Another use again I make of this place thus. The Lord here (I see) would not
suffer them pass by the Philistims, lest they should start back, and so sin
greeuouslie againg him. And what if in like sort he prevent my sinning, and
your sinning against him, by taking away from us such things, as he in his
wisdom knows would be occasions of evil unto us, if we had them, whatsoever
we think, as Riches, friends, power, health of body, peace of mind and such
like, is not he therein careful of us, and as gracious unto us, as here he
was to these his people, in not suffering them to go that way, which (though
it were nearer) night endanger them? Certainly he is: and therefore pray for
eyes to see it, and a heart to feel it with assurance; be content with your
estate, and with his will, the end shall show you, all this is true.

Why? but could not God have stayed them from returning, although they had gone
the nearer way? Cyril answers, Non Deus omnia operatur vt potest, sed
quandoque Cyril. in Exodus
(humano more) pericula fugere illos voluit, id nos facere docens, etiam dum
apertissime Deum adiutorem habemus. God does not work all things as he can,
but sometimes does Aug. quest. 49. in Exodus vide.
eschew perils (after the manner of men) therein teaching us to do the like
(namely by using means) even then when most plainly we have God our helper.

2. The Children of Israel went up armed out of the Ver. 18.
Land of Egypt, says the Text. And it may teach us wariness and
circumspection in our vocatiens; ever reckoning of the enemy in this our holy
march toward the Land of Promise. Joseph's bones are carried away with Ver. 19.
them, according to the oath made unto him; which may teach us faithfulness and
truth in the desires of dead men evermore: a thing always of good regard with
good men, and too little regarded by many that would be judged good men. But no
show of warrant here for the Popish fooleries and impieties used about their
Relics. For this promise to translate his bones, was taken by Joseph to show
his Faith in the promise of GOD, touching the Land of Promise to be given in
time, and it was performed by the Israelites in discharge of truth without any
superstition, or Idolatry, as in Popery is used most offensiuely.

The 3. part.
THe last general Head is, concerning the signs of direction which the Lord
vouchsafed them; namely, a Ver. 21.
Cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night. Whereof the Psalm speaks,
alluding to this Story, In the day time Psalm. 78, 14.
he led them with a Cloud, and all the night long with a light of fire. And
again, He spread a cloud to be a covering, and fire to give light in the
night season. By this Psalm. 105. 39.
Great miracle showing that ye Israelites deliverance was from himself, and by
no other means under Heaven. Secondly, that he was present with them to
defend and save them from all their enemies. And thirdly, that in like sort he
guides and protecteth his faithful, marching out of Egypt toward the
promised Land, through the Wilderness of woe and affliction: which indeed he
still does by his Word and Sacraments, two guides to us as these pillars were
to them. So necessary is it after deliverance to be guided, that without the
one the other will not serve. And if more particularly you will meditate on
them, consider in ye Cloud, how it not only directs the way, but is spread,
as the Psalm says, for a covering; namely, against the heat of the Sun,
saving them from the violence thereof, and comfortably cooling and refreshing
them. Remember also how the afflictions of this world in the Gospel are noted
by the heat of the Sun. And be you assured in a true Faith, that even ever,
ever, against these heates the Lord, in his good time, will send you defense
and comfort. For still you must know that yesterday, and today, and for ever He
is the same. Meditate on the Apostles Heb. 13. 8.
experience, 2. Cor. 1. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of all mercies, and 2. Cor. 1, 3.
the God of all comfort, which comfort us in all our tribulations, (see the
cooling Cloud) that we may be able to 4.
comfort them which are in any affliction, by the comfort wherewith we our
selves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so
our consolation 5.
abounds through Christ, etc. Thus to Paul, thus to you, thus to all
assuredly. In the other pillar of fire observe, that (beside direction by going
before) it also gave light unto them in the night. And thereby learn with a
feeling comfort, that whosoever follow Christ as their Guide and Leader, they
still have light in others darkness. So says He himself, He that follows
me, shall not John. 8. 14.
walk in darkness, but shall have that light of life. In both the one and the
other see a Notable Figure of Christ, in who^ there is cooling, and without
whom there is scorching heat; in whom there is light, and without whom there
is hellish darkness: In the world ye shall have trouble, but in me ye shall
have peace. The words which follow, (That they might go both by day and by
night) most notably remember us, that in traveling toward the spiritual
Canaan we must not rest, but labor forward continually. The Chiidren of this
world are often looking back toward Egypt, and often pitch down their Tents:
so in this Wilderness, that they are loath ever to take them up and to remove.
But with the Sons of God it is not so, but they say with themselves, We have
here no abiding City: and fixing both eye and heart on their Heavenly house,
they journey on still both day and night in true piety and obedience: and they
are not quiet till they have attained to the Haven, and see their God with his
holy company in the highest Heavens. Last of all, when it is said, He took
not away the ver. 22.
pillar of the Cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the
people. Let it ever assure your fearing heart, cooling and comforting, shining
and lighting, guiding and directing his little flock, shall never be taken
away from any member thereof, but ever be ready and present with us both by
day and night, to the eternal praise of his goodness, and unspeakable comfort
of our souls; blessed again and again be his name for it. And thus far of
this Chapter.

CHAP. 14.
The Heads of this Chapter may be these. 1. The pursuing of Pharaoh after them.
2. The fear of the Israelites when they saw him. v^. 10. 3. Their fall and
sin through their fear. ver. 11. 4. The Lords deliverance of them.


1. TOuching the first, mark what a strait the Lord brought his people into,
when He commanded Moses to speak unto them to ver. 1. and 2.
camp before P^-hakiroth, between Migdol and the Sea, over against
Baal-zephon: where the Sea was before them, Mountains on either side, and
Pharaoh with his Host at their backs, the Lord hardening his heart to follow
after them: yet was not this distress for their hurt, but for their good, that
God might be honored, they miraculously delivered, and their enemies
gloriously overthrown. How then do we fear in every adversity before we
see the end? Surely we wrong the Lord much, and our selves, in so doing; he
being as good, as ever he was; as mighty, as ever he was, to find means; and
as just as ever he was to punish our malicious enemies. O, think then with
your self, and reason thus: Lo, here I am distressed on every side, as the
Israelites were at the Red Sea: and it is the providence of God, that I should
be thus, as it was his Will they should pitch in that place. But do I know the
Lords meaning, and what he will do? No indeed. And therefore I will patiently
wait for his blessed Will, not murmuring as the Israelites did, but
comfortably assuring my self, that one way or other the Lord will give issue
to his glory and my good (although as yet I see not how) because he is no
Changeling in his love to his Servants, and did (beyond all conceit of man)
deliver these Israelites from this peril. Surely there can be no perplexity
in this world greater than this was, if all things be considered, and yet all
was most well in the end. Remember we therefore always the words of David in
his Psalms, When I am in heaviness I will think upon God, when my heart is
vexed I will complain. I will cry unto God with my voice, yea even to God Psalm.
77. 1. etc.
will I cry with my voice, and he shall hearken unto me, etc. The whole Psalm
is comfortable, if you read it.

2, For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, they ver. 3.
are tangled in the Land; the Wilderness has shut them in etc. So they were
indeed, if we consider the place where they were: yet there is no tangling
where the Lord will have a passage. But see you here in your Meditation, how,
when the destruction of the wicked is at hand, the Lord (in his justice)
offers them some bait or other to pull them on: that, as here He says, He
may win his honor upon them, and they know he is the Lord. So was Ahab
drawn Ver. 4.
to his end with a desire to recover Ramoth Gilead which 1. Kings. 22, 3.
once was his, the bait allured him, the wrath of God flewe him. So were
Senacharib and the Asyrians baited, as it were, with former success with their
multitude, and the smallenes of Ezechias his number. But how gloriously did
the Lord deliver his, and destroy them that so boasted? Many such Examples may
you remember by your self, all teaching what a sure thing it is to belong to
God, and to have our trust in him only. For otherwise there will be a time of
falling for us, and we shall even run upon it greedily as these men did. You
may also here think of the number noted by Josephus, who adds to the 600.
Chariots mentioned in the Text, ver. 7. fifty thousand Horsemen, and two
hundred thousand footmen more, all marching after Gods people with great
confidence and iolity, and yet all overthrown in the deep by a mighty God
most easily: So great a God is our God, and it must ever comfort us, and make
us strong. Observe again their words uttered before they pursued after them,
Why have we this done, and let Israel go out of our service? ver. 5.
Which shows how quickly the wicked repent them of their good, but seldom or
never of their evil. For to let them go was good, and yet they repented; but
to pursue after them was evil, and they repented not. Many such there be in
our days which often grieve at an hour spent in the Church, and never of
days and years spent in sin. But let them look upon these Egyptians here,
and be warned in time, if God so will. The difference of the hosts again in
this place is very worthy observing, the one all warriers and well appointed,
the other full of weak women and little children. The chiefest men without
great munition or any exact order military to match with them, yet the weaker
lives, and the stronger dies: ever to teach us to fix our hearts upon God,
and not to be tied to outward show, For there is no wisdom, Pro. 21. 30.
no counsel, nor strength against the Lord. The horse is prepared against the
day of battle: but salvation is of the 31.
Lord. And as the Prophet Esaias says, Gather together on heaps, O ye people,
and ye shall be broken in pieces, and Esaias, 8. 9.
hearken all ye of far Countries: gird your selves, and you shall be broken in
pieces, gird your selves and you shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel
together, yet it shall be brought to naught: pronounce a decree, yet shall it
not 10.
stand: for God is with us, etc. Repeating things over and over, that we may be
assured, and always strong in him.

3. Again I see here, and mark it for my good, that when we are once
delivered out of Egypt, then does the Devil muster his Chariots and Horsemen,
and after us he will, if he can get leave. He cannot abide to loose his servants
so, His we were, and he has lost us, and his we must be again, if by all his
strength he can possibly gain us. A Land that flows with milk and honey,
may not be inherited without resistance. Out of Egypt we may be delivered, but
from following afflictions we shall not be quite freed. Hue and Cry will be
made by Hell after us, and we shall be tried as God pleases. Think of that
Devil in the Gospel, who when he must needs depart and loose his possession,
did rend Mark. 9. 26.
and tear the poor party most cruelly. Think of those Stories of the
Primative Church, how Nero, Domitian, Dioclesian, and all those persecuting
Emperors pursued the Christians, delivered from darkness to light. What were
they all but Satan Host, doing then as Pharaoh did here by the mighty hand of
a just revenging God. The Land of Canaan is ours, but in our way thither look
for lets. When the Dear is hued-in by the Hunters, and the dogs placed to
make a course, if he take his way upon the Dogs, every man is silent, and
lets him go, for that is the way to death, and it well pleases the
Hunters. But if he offer to break out some other way, and to escape the
Dogs; then they cry and beat the hedges to drive him back again, and if
he escape, how disconted are they? So, so, in our Deliverance from Death and
Hell do we plainly see it. And therefore hoping for the best, when God shall
see it fit, be prepared always in your self for ye worst, and (reckon of it)
Pharaoh will pursue you.

4. When Pharaoh drew near, the Israelites weresore ver. 10. 11.
afraid, and cried unto the Lord. Others said unto Moses, have thou brought us
out of Egypt to die in the Wilderness, etc. Philo says, Quatuor tribus in aquis
submergi voluisse, Philo in vita Mosis.
ne ad Aegypttorum manus peruenirent; alias quatuor se tradere Aegyptijs
constituisse, cum spe veniam impetrandi; sed reliquas quatuor (scilicet, Judah,
Leui, Joseph, and Benjamin) vsque ad mortem cum illis pugnare decreuisse. That
4. Tribes resolved to drown themselves in the waters, rather than to fall into
the Egyptians hands; other 4 Tribes determined to submit themselves to the
Egyptians, in hope of pardon and forgiveness; but the 4 Tribes left after these
(namely, Judah, Leui, Joseph, and Benjamin) settled themselves to fight (as long
as they should be able to stand alive) against them. Note then here how
affliction tries what is in us: for such as here rested upon God cried (you
see) unto him, and no doubt hoped of help from him, well considering that, vbi
humanum deest consilium, ibi Diuinum Aug. in Ps. Qui habitat.
adest auxilium. Where man's Counsel fails, there Gods help is present.
Others not so grounded and settled, foulely and sinfully discovered their
corruption, and quarrelled with Gods Minister sent for their comfort,
reproaching him bitterly, as you see in the Text. Look therefore how the fire
tries the gold, parting the dross from that which is pure: so does adversity
try ye sons of men, and sever the good from the ^uill. Be we rooted therefore
in his holy promises, and look not too much upon heaps of men as these
murmuring Israelites did; for it is all one with the Lord to overcome many and
few, and with many, or few. Faith must ever look at him, and say cheerfully
as David, The Lord Psalm. 27. (...).
is my light and my salvation, whom then shall I fear? the Lord is the
strength of my life, of whom then shall I be afraid? Though an host of men
were laid 3.
against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid: And though there rose up war
against me, yet will I put my trust in Psa. 17. 3.
him, etc. For if we look at the billowe of the Sea coming against us, we
shall be afraid, and begin to sink.

5. Then Moses said to the people, fear ye not, ver. 13.
but stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord which he will show to
you this day. For the Egyptians whom you have seen to day ye shall never see
again. The Lord shall fight for you, therefore hold you your 14.
peace. Josephus relates a long Oration wherewith Moses exhorts them: but
these words are effectual, Josephus 2. antiq. cap. 14.
and contain the substance. A worthy and wonderful strength in the servant
of GOD, who heretofore looked at the difficulties of his Calling, at his own
weakness and wants, and at the ingratitude of men toward those that have best
deserved; yet now raises himself above all these in a most holy Faith, and
comfort the people with assurance of a great and most gracious Deliverance.
Thus can the Lord give strength to any man in his vocation when he will,
making him mount above all earthly conceits, and to see nothing but the power
of God, and truth ever in his promises. Wherefore pray for this Grace in all
touches and plunges of this miserable world: And learn of Moses here, by use
and experience to cast behind us the undeserved speeches of men either
malicious or unthankful, and be strong and cheerful in our Charge,
notwithstanding a thousand of them. Learn also of him, both in our selves to
be assured, and to assure others in the distresses of the Church: that, as God
waketh when we sleep, so will he fight for us, when we st^nd still: and that
in our greatest weakness his strength shall appear. The Egyptians are vanity
says the Prophet, and therefore God cries to Jerusalem, That her strength is
to sit Esaias. 13. 15.
still. And again to Iehosaphat, Fear not, neither be afraid for this great
multitude: for the battle is not 2. Chro. 15.
yours, but Gods. You shall not need to fight in this battle: stand still,
move not, and behold the salvation of the Lord toward you, etc. Iehosophat
thereupon to the people, Hear O Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: put your
trust in your Lord your God, and you shall be assured: believe his Prophets, and
ye shall prosper. All Notable places ever to be in our rembrance, yea even in
spiritual conflicts say thus with your self: O my Soul, fear not though
Satan thrust thus sore at thee, and seek thy destruction; but look unto him
that is mightier than al Hell: believe his Prophets, believe his promises,
believe his Word, and the Egyptians (whom thou have seen to day) thou shall
never see again, that is, those frights and those fears, enemies to thy peace
and comfort in God, thou shall never be troubled with them any more; but God
shall so drown them in ye Red Sea of his dear Sons blood, that they shall not
hurt the nor harm thee, shake thee nor shiuer thee, nip thee nor touch thee as
they have done. The Lord shall fight for thee, O my Soul, therefore stand thou
still, and wait upon him, etc. Further may you go in this meditation, if you
will.

6. And the Lord said unto Moses why cryest thou ver. 15.
unto me, bid the people go forward. God does not speak this, says One,
quod eius clamor ill^ displiceret, sed vt se exauditum cognosceret. because his
cry did displease him, but that he might know that he heard him. See the course
of a holy Governor; the people murmur and reproach him wickedly, yet be for
them prays most heartily; See also the mercy of God in sparing and not
confounding Clamor iste erat oration cordis; vnde Chaldeus legit, suscep^
orationem tuam and Rupertus fidei magnae vociferationem interpretatur.
such unthankful sinners: and see the force of prayer, though it be but in
groans of your inward heart; it even cries in Gods ears, it pearceth the
heavens and pulls down comfort as is fit. See likewise the duty of all
faithful believers, To go forward, as here is said to the Israelites,
notwithstanding Seas before us, hills about us, and whatsoever it may be that
is against us, leaving all to the Lord who knows his own purpose, and will
manifest the same in due time. Forward, Forward, says God here, speak unto
the Children of Israel that they go forward: And let it ring in our ears
whilst we live: But why did Moses cry thus in his heart to God, when it was
revealed to him, what should be ye end of the Egyptians? Surely, because
neither promises nor reuelatio^s hinder ye Children of God from using ordinary

Israel removed and went behind them. Who this Angel was we saw in ye Chap.

side was dark to the Egyptians: and in respect of ye dark side, was called a
cloud, although it were not of the nature of Columna ista non press^ a^re

other Clouds, but a more Divine thing, higher than man's mind is able to
comprehend, by which (in the day time) the heat of the Sun was tempered;
and in the night a comfortable light given says Greg. Nyssen writing of the
life of Moses. The comfort and use I take from it, is this, that in new
perilles the Lord can have new remedies at his pleasure: Now before us, and now
behind us, and evermore with us, if we be with him by a sure trust in his
goodness, blessed be his Name evermore for it. ver. 21. Psalm. 22.
The wind which the Lord used, to cause the Sea to runnebacke, was not for any
need of such means, but that he might show his power over all creatures, to
use them and command them at his will. So by the water of Jorden he healed
Naaman; when he could have healed him without it. By clay and spittle he opened
eyes, and diverse such things in the Scriptures, when (at other times) by his
only Word he did as much, without any means at all. Then went they through, on
dry land, and the waters stood as a wall unto them, on the right hand, and on
the left. If you ask, how they durst adventure to pass so dangerously, seeing
the waters might have gushed together again, and have overwhelmed them? The
Epistle to the Hebrews tells us, That by faith they passed through the
Red Sea as Heb. 11. 2^.
by dry land, which when the Egyptians had assaied to do they were
swallowed-vp. If you look at the waters on either side, you may see the
condition of Gods Children in this world, beset on the right side with a flood
of prosperity, and beset on the left side with a flood of adversity: and yet
(through a true faith) walking through both, and hurt by neither, they arrive
on the other side safely, when by either of these many others are destroyed:
pray we then ever for this Faith.

8 The Egyptians feel the Lord against them, and Ver. 25.
then would fly, but it was too late. And let it ever preach unto our minds
the danger of deferring our conversion to GOD. For when we would, we shall
not; but even perish and die, as here did the Egyptians. O what news in Egypt
was this, when it came? what woe, and what weeping? what wailing and wringing
of hands by wives for their husbands, children for their Fathers, and friends
for their friends which now were devoured of the cruel Sea? But it is too
late: Had I wist comes ever behind says the old Proverb. And therefore a
notable Example is this to all degrees, one to persuade with an other unto
Religion and the true service of God, that such fearful news may never be
brought to our friends of us. For the Lord will not ever bear with our
contempt, but as here was a heavy Morning, ver. 27.
when the Sea roaring returned together, and they flying and crying in the
midst of it: so assuredly shall there be either a morning, or an evening of
misery unto them who proudly disdain to be taught of their God: happy are
they that think of it in time.

9 The glorious victory of the Church here is a thing worthy all due
consideration; yielding us comfort to the ver. 28.
worlds end in all our perplexities. For, how do they see their enemies
destroyed, and themselves delivered? how triumph they in Songs of joy and
gladness in the next Chapter, verse 1. etc? This is the Word, and we must
believe it; these are his promises, and we must be strong in them. The Church
is Christ's body, Romans 12. 5. Ephesians. 1. 23. Chap. 4. 12. Colos 1. 24.
therefore it shall not be forsaken: It is the house of God, 1. Tim. 3. 15.
Heb. 3. 6. 1. Pet. 4. 17.
therefore it shall not be forsaken: He has bought it with his blood, Acts 20.
28. 1. Pet. 1. 18. therefore it shall not be forsaken: It is his spouse, Hosea
2. 19. 2. Cor. 11. 2. Apoc. 21. 2. and 9. therefore it shall not be forsaken: It
is built upon Christ Mat. 16. Non aedificabo me super te, sed aedificabo te
super me Aug.
18. therefore it shall not be forsaken: In a word the Ga^es of Hell shall not
prevail against it, neither of his kingdom shall there be any end* Math. 16.
Luke 1. 33. The harmers of his Church shall in their time be punished, and the
favorers of it ever blessed. I will bless them that bless thee, (says God
to Abraham) and curse them that curse thee. Sehon King of the Amorites, and Og
the King of Basan Genesis 12. 3.
with all the rest of that sort, how did they fall before Gods people and were
destroyed? The Great Mona^chies of the world the Chaldaean, the Persian, the
Grecian and the Roman, which were not obedient to his Truth and favorers of
his flock, where are they? On the other Exodus 1. 20. Joshua. 6. 25. 1. Kings.
17. Ier. 39. 17.
side, how blessed be the Midwiues that were kind unto his people? how saved
he Rahab and all her family? The Widow of Sarepta lost not her love to his
Prophet neither the Ethiopian in Jeremy, nor any other. So is his Church right
dear unto him, you plainly see; and it is the comfort strong of every member:
For the love of the body draws a love of the hand and foot and every part,
we see in experience by our own bodies. No part can perish without a great
grief to the whole, neither the vilest part be but a little touched, without
an offense to the very heart. What comparison betwixt us, and Christ, in our
love, and his? None, none, and the more he exceeds us, ye more is our comfort
and joy. We never said yt God wanted a Church before Luther, as we are either
foolishly vnder^^ood, or maliciosly reported; but we know, he blesses not all
times alike, punishing man's ingratitude often with Clouds yet ever he has his
people and ever shall have to the end. In regard of which variable estate, the
Church Origin, ^o. 2. upon Genesis Aug. de cinit. dei lib. 15. cap. 26. Epiph.
(...)es. 61. etc.
is resembled to the Moon, which after full has a wanne, and never abides
still full. It is compared to a ship tosse^ and tumbled in the Sea, and in
great peril many times, of which you may often think with much profit. How
the Ark of Noah ^igured the Church, you may read in the Notes upon Genesis,
Chapter 6. And if you desire to peruse the old Fathers, these marginall places
may direct you. Nauis non ex vno ligno constat, sed ex diuersis, etc. A ship is
not made of one board, says Epiphanius. No more does the Church consist of
one man, or of one sort of men. A Ship is narrow at the beginning, and then
much broader in the middle: so the Church at first is small, and far greater
in time; yea, even spread abroad in the world. Narrow and straight is Abel, and
Sheth, little and small in No^ and his famil^e, but seventy Souls came into
Egypt yet thousands and thousands grew of the^. Narrow was the Ship in Elias
time, but Achab and Iezebel being gone, it grew broader. The Apostles and
Disciples were but few; but when at one Sermon there were added three thousand
Souls, the Ship you see grew broader. And so of those persecuting Emperors
till godly Constantine came. A Ship has a Governor to direct her, and so has
the Church her Pilots also. And as in the Ship the Pilot may not be blind,
that he cannot see Recks and Promontories dangerous to be touched; may not be
deaf, that he cannot hear the advice of others; may not be unskillful in
times and seasons, with many other things: even so much less may the Church
Governors be such. The Mariners in a Ship may not be without hands, unable to
row when there is need; no more may Men in the Church be unfit for the places
they possess. In the Ship there are many Offices, and yet all care for the
Ship; so in the Church there are diversity of administrations and yet al must
labor for the Ephesians. 4. 11. 1. Cor. 12. 8.
Churches sake. Some Prophets, some Apostles, some Evangelists, some Pastors
and Doctors. To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom: and, to an
other the word of knowledge: To one faith, to an other the gift of healing etc.
There be Ships of true men, and Ships of Pirates; so there is a Church true and
a Church false. The false Church falls, when it rises; And the true church
rises, when it seems to fall. The true Church endures nothing strange; and
in the false Church every thing is strange. Remember what you read in the
Prophet, of Tyrus: and make Ezech 27. 5. see Hierom upon the place.
use of it to this end. They have made all thy ship bords of Fur trees of
Shenir: they have brought Cedars from Lebanon, to make masts for thee. Of the
Oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars: The company of the Asyrians 6.
have made thy banks of Iuorie, brought out of the jles of Chittim. Fine linen
with broydered work, brought from 7.
Egypt, was spread over thee to be thy sail, blew silk and purple brought
from the Isles of Elishah, was thy covering. The inhabitants of Zidon, and Aruad
were thy mariners, O Tyrus: thy wisemen that were in thee, they were the
pilots, etc. Even so, so, in the false Church is every thing strange, and far
fet. For if it come not from Rome, it is not for this Church, neither any
account, or use made of it. Strange Doctrines in every point of Religion,
strange Ceremonies never known, or used of the Apostles: beads and bables,
infinite toys and tricks of hallowed trash too long to be repeated, all as
strange as ever was any thing in Tyrus. Wherefore, as the fall of Tyrus Ezech.
27. Apoc, 18. Mark. 6 47.
was also strange, so shall it be of this church in Gods time. This Ship in the
Gospel is said to be troubled, and it notes what the Church, and every member
thereof in this world is subject unto. The perils of the Ship are amplified by
certain Circumstances there mentioned; as of time, yt it was night; of place,
that it was in the Sea and ye midst of the Sea, of contrary winds, and of
Christ's absence, all occasions of more trouble, and danger. For in the night
there is darkness, the Rocks cannot be so well discerned; there is less help,
than on the day time; storms and tempests are usually greater, and many other
discommodities. In regard whereof the Poet Virgil could say,

Eripiunt subito nubes coelumque diemque
Nautarum ex oculis, ponto nox incubat atra: Lib. 1. Aeneid.

Presentemque viris intentant omnia mortem.
This night natural may resemble unto us a double night, where in the Ship
of the Church is much endangered, the night of ignorance, and the night of
sin. Either of them is a great darkness, and yet little thought of. No
night so full of peril to a sailing Ship, as either of these to the militant
Church. Of the first Saint Basil complains to his Friend in his Epistle,
saying, P. afil. Epist. 89.
Ecclesia sine Pastoribus nauigatio in noote, pax nusquam; Christus dormit,
quid non igitur timendum est? The sailing here of the militant Church without
Pastors and Teachers, is a sailing in the night, no light any where; Christ is
a sleep, and what therefore is not to be feared? Of the second night (the
night of sin) the Scripture every where it self complains, showing the
distress of the Church where such darkness abides. In the Psalm: Help Lord,
for there is not one godly man left: the faithful are gone from amongst men.
Every one talks of Psalm. 12. 1.
vanity with his neighbor, they flatter with their lips, and 2.
dissemble in their double heart. Psa. 14. 2, and 3
There is none righteous no not one, there is none that understands, there is
none that seeks after God. Psalm. 5, 9.
Their throat is an open Sepulcher, they use their tongues to deceit. Psalm.
140. 3.
The poison of Aspes is under their lips. Psalm. 10. 7.
Their mouth is full of bitterness and cursing. Esaias. 59. 78. Romans 3. 15. 16.
17. 18.
Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and calamity are in their
ways, And the way of peace they have not known. The fear of God is not
before their eyes. What a fearful night now is this upon the Church? yet add
unto this the 3. of Esaias and many such other places, and judge if it can go
worse with any ship at Sea in the blackest night, than with the Church in such
dangerous darkness as this. Eusebius speaks of it, and (me think) his words
are much to be noted; Postquam, res nostrae per nimiam libertatem ad mollitiem
and segnitiem degenerarunt, Lib. 8. hist. cap. 1
and alij alios odio ac contumelijs sunt persecuti, and tantum non nos ipsos
per nos ipsos armis ac telis verborum vbicunque contigit, impugnauimus, and
Episcopi in Episcopos irruerunt, Samma procul villarum culmina fumant
maioresque cadunt altis de montibus vmbrae. Virgil. Eglog. 1.
ac populi contra populos seditiones mouerunt, deinde infanda hypocrisis and
simulatio ad summum vsque malitiae progressa fuit: Diuinum iudicium pro more
suo senfim ac pedetentim nos inuisere cepit etc. After, all things amongst us
through too much liberty grew unto wantonness and sloth, and every one with
hatred and slander persecuted another, etc. Bishops falling upon Bishops, and
people upon people, hypocrisy and dissimulation growing to an height, Gods
judgment (according as it uses) by little and little visited us, etc. See
this night of the Church, which we speak of, and the danger of it.

The second Circumstance was of place, the ship was in the Sea, and in the
midst of the Sea, not near any Haven, far from all help by land, and
exposed to the very full power of wind and water. A great Circumstance of
peril and danger, as we all know. And thus is the ship of the Church said to
be, when either heresies or schisms abound in it, or cruel persecution rages
against it. Of the Basil. de Spiritu Sancto. ca. 30.
first S. Basil speaks, comparing the troubles of ye Church to the surges of
the Sea, in which the ancient bounds of the Fathers are moved, every foundation
and ground of Doctrine shaken by Schismatickes and Heritickes, who are as the
froth raised by those waves and surges. To the second we may refer those
raging furies of Nero Domitian, and the rest, of whom Theodoret writes thus,
Quod illi crudelitatis genus in Christianos commenti non sunt? an non manus
pedesque absciderunt? an non aures naresque obtruncaruut, etc? What kind of
cruelty did not they devise against the Christians? Did not they cut off their
hands and feet, their ears and noses, and iuuent all strait bands to the
height and extremity of torment, etc? Thus we see the Church in the midst of
the Sea, compassed about in this sort with enemies domestical and foreign.
Domestical, heretics and Schismatickes, who (as a generation of vipers)
gnawe asunder their Mothers belly. Foreign, Pagans and Heathens, who cruelly
and bloodily trouble the poor ship: by means whereof, sometimes she mounteth
aloft, as a ship does, being praised and commended greatly; and sometimes she
is thrown down by reproaches and contumelies of much contempt, being in case
even fitly to say with the Poet,

Tollimur in coelum curuato gurgite; and ijdem
Subducta ad manes imos descendimus vnda.
Or rather, with the Psalm, We are carried up to the Heavens, and down again
to the deep. Our soul melts in us, and we are even at deaths door.

Another Circumstance were contrary winds, which vehemently did beat the
ship, even as still and daily infinite crosses do the Church and members of
it: as, when we are in health, and sail merrily, suddenly comes a contrary
wind of sickness, and shakes us shrewdly. When we are rich, losses come; when
we have friends, they die; our good name is touched, our servants deceive us,
our children miscarie or rebel against us, and infinite are the contrary
winds that arise, and trouble this sailing ship of ours in this world. The
last (but not the least) was Christ's absence from them. For as soon as he
had sent them away, says the Gospel, he departed into a mountain to pray.
Let this inform us how dangerous the absence Mark. 6, 46.
of the Pastor is. When Moses was absent, the Israelites Exodus 32. 1. Math. 13.
25.
fell to great and gross Idolatry. Whilst men sleep the enemy sows
tares. And what too much absence of Pastors has done of evil in England, who
can tell? We are present often in the time of profit, but absent too often
touching pains. The ships therefore, over which the Lord has appointed many
of us, are not only troubled as this was; but almost even sunk and cast away
by contrary winds of Romish charms. These are the perils of the ship. Now
may we likewise in the same place of the Gospel observe our duties in these
perils. Laborant in remigando. Math. 14, 23. Mark. 6. 48.
They took great pains in rowing; pains and pains together, with consent
and agreement: Two excellent things, and most worthy noting. We may not then
cast away hope in every storm, and commit the ship to the mercy of the Sea;
for thus did not here the Lords Disciples: but we must row, and labor in
rowing, and that jointly all hands together; not some row, and some Basilius
vltro reconciliat Eusebio episcopo loci, ne Ariam ex eorum dissidio
praeualerent. Niceph. lib. 11. 18.
sleep; not some row forward, and some backward; not some help, and some
hinder; but all, I say again, and all together, as Watermen lift together,
and strike together; and all one way, with one heart and will, seeking to save
the ship against contrary winds, waves and perils: for thus did the Disciples
here. Princes and Prelates are these Rowers in the ship of this Church: and
then every one that has any interest in his place, and for his place, must
show his care and join his help that all may be safe. For though the ship
almost touched the shore, yet may she quickly be driven back again into the
deep, if this rowing slack. Darius the Father of Xerxes was wont to say, that
the wars made him wise, and surely so may the ships dangers make every man
more expert. But no man must faint and give over in peril, for the end will be
good, and such fainting fear should be very sinful. If I should enter into
particulars, surely much negligence might appear: but I rather wish every man
to awake his own heart; that whatsoever is past, yet hereafter it may be
better, and if there be ever a sleeping Jonas, awake him, and bid him call upon
his God. Thus doing, the end (I say) will be good. For mark now what
follows in the Gospel. The Disciples thus laboring painfully in rowing, the
Lord Jesus saw them, came unto them, and all was well. He sees all men and
all matters, but a gracious eye has he ever to those that are laboring in
rowing according to their calling, which what a comfort it is, judge you. And
he not only sees them, but comes unto them, says, It is I, and makes all
things well. This is the happy victory of the Church and every member of the
same at last, over all perilles and dangers, winds and waves, storms and
tempests whatsoever. To this therefore cast both eye and heart, and be ever
cheered in the assurance of it. The tempest is great, Acts. 5. but they
rowe-on, and overcome. There is a great billowe rises against Saint Paul,
Acts. 13: even Elimas the Sorcerer; but strongly Paul rowed-on, and overcame.
Athanasius and Hilarie against Arrius, Basil against Eunomius, Tertullian
against Hermogines, Origin against Celsus, Augustine against Faustus and
Pelagius, Cyprian against Nouatus, etc, How painfully, how carefully did they
row, and overcome? Scripturae remis Doctores aequora verrunt: With the oars
of Gods holy word these Doctors overcame all those waves and winds. Post
lachrimas risus, post exilium Paradisus, dixerunt Veteres. After weeping comes
laughing, and after banishment comes Paradise, said our Elders. Caesar bad the
Mariner Confide, nauta, nam Caesarem vehis.
be of good comfort, because he carried him, so great a Monarch: But how much
more may the ship wherein Christ is be comforted? When came Christ to them,
says the Text? Surely, not till the fourth watch of the night, that is, not
till the Morning or days dawning. For the night being divided in to four
watches or parts, to wit, the beginning of the night, the midnight, the Cocks
crow about three of the clock after midnight, and the dawning: This you see
is last; so that all the night it pleased Christ to let them be troubled, and
he did not by and by come unto them. Teaching thereby all his faithful to be
strong and patient not yielding to temptation, if in have the Lord come not
with help, but stoutly and strongly wrestling till he come, leaving the tune
to his own good pleasure, and comfortablie being assured that he will come at
last, as here and ever he did. Turbatur mare, fluctuabat nauicula: nauicula
Ecclesia est, mare seculum: sed venit Dominus and ambulauit supra mare, and
pressit fluctus spumantes and magni (potestate scilicet) and reges crediderunt
Christo, and subingati sunt. The Sea is troubled Aug. in Psalm. 92. in fine.
(says Saint Augustine) and the ship is tossed: the ship is the Church, and
the Sea is the world; but the Lord came and walked upon the Sea, and repressed
all these smelling waves and billows, to wit, the Kings and potentates of the
earth believed in Christ, and were sub dued to him. Who whilst they raged
against the poor ship, were so far from sinking her, (as they desired to
do) Vt plane illis persimiles inuenti sint, etc. That altogether (says
Theodoret) they became like unto those, that seeking to quench the flame,
fondly pour oil in, and so make it greater. And even as the bush that Moses
saw was not consumed with fire: no more could the enemies with their wars
and weapons overthrow it. Simones, Marciones, Valentini, etc. The Simoncans,
the Marcionits, the Valentinians, and a number more (says Greg. Nazianz.) they
are all drowned in their own deepes, and the Church is delivered. Ever
therefore, as the Israelites here against Pharaoh and his heast; so shall Gods
Church have victory against her enemies; but in Gods time, not at her own
will. Till then constant Faith and painful rowing be graces becoming the
Church and every member of it. I am Joseph your brother, was a word of great
comfort, you know, in the Figure; and It is I, it is I, be not afraid, is a
far greater comfort in Christ who was figured, blotting all fears whatsoever
out of our hearts.

Lastly, Thus Israel saw the mighty power, which ver 31.
the Lord showed upon the Egyptians: so the people feared the Lord, and
believed the Lord, and his servant Moses. This is the end of Gods mercies to
his Children, and of his judgment upon their foes, To increase all good duties
in them toward him: and (by name) a reverend fear of his Majesty: and a
faithful assurance in his love. They believed before in some measure, but now
in a greater measure, as may be said of the Disciples where the like Speech
is used, John, 2. 11. They believed also his servant Moses, that is, they now
plainly see that God was with him whom they so wickedly had abused. Let it
profit us to beware by them either to distrust God, or to wrong his Ministers
appointed over us, and let us learn, that although Faith respect GOD only,
yet is there such an union betwixt him and his Ministers, as in deed and truth
we cannot believe him, unless we also believe his Ministers speaking from him.
And therefore who^ God has joined (even in this sense also) let no man sever,
but believe the Lord, and his servant Moses. What is past of unkindness toward
your faithful Minister caring for you, praying for you, and weeping for you
when you are fast on sleep in your bed, Let it grieve your heart in your
secret chamber, and do so no more; the Lord is with him, and his service is
Gods mercy to you, the abuse or contempt of him will so grieve the Lord, that
you are sure to feel his heavy hand for it. Be wise therefore, and let both
this particular and the whole Chapter profit you in Gods blessing.

CHAP. 15.
Consider in this Chapter these two general Heads. (...). The thanksgiving
both of men and women. 2. The fall again of these Israelites at Marah.


1. TOuching the first observe ye antiquity of writing in verse, and the
reason why Moses used verse here: even to continue a longer and better
remembrance of so famous a work of God for his Church: for we all see by
experience, that what is written in verse, both more affects, and more
sticks in the memory, than what is written in prose. We must learn also by
this Example, ever after mercies and comforts to give thanks. For the Custom
of the Church is the instruction of every particular man and woman in the
Church. The custom we see here, and in other places. What Melchisedech did
after Abraham's victory, we read in Genesis. Genesis 14. 18.
What Deborah and Barak did, we read in Judges. Judge. 5. 2. 1. Sam. 18. 2.
What the women sang to Saul and David, we read in that Story: as also what
was carefully done after that great victory and deliverance vouchsafed to
Iehosaphat. 2. Chron. 20. 27. 28.
A feast was kept every year to remember thankfully Hamans destruction, and
the Jews joyful deliverance. Hester. 9. 17. Iudeth. 16. 1.
Iudeths service and blessing with God is not forgotten: And, if you go to
David's Psalms, how many of them are Psalms of thanksgiving after benefits? Of
the cleansed Luke 17. 15. Luke 5. 25. Act, 3. 8.
Leapers though nine forget yet one is thankful. The man healed of the palsy
takes up his bed, and praises God. The Creeple healed entered into the Temple,
walking, and leaping, and praising God. God and man abhor the contrary, and
when thou art truly said to be unthankful (but even to man) there is in that
one word all evil contained and affirmed of thee. Now, if private benefits
should be remembered, much more public which touch so many. Whereforefor both,
be ever thanksfull to God as the fountain, and to man, as his means.
Imperfection in this duty beseech him to pardon, etc.

2. When was this thanksgiving made? The Text tells ver. 1.
you in this word THEN, Then sang Moses and the children of Israel. That is,
even presently as soon as they could gather all their company together on the
other side of ye sea, whither so happily they were brought on dry foot by a
mighty God. In the 5, of Judges you may note it also, THEN sang Deborah and
Barak, even the same day. And surely, to defer, it is always dangerous, so
soon are we cooled and become dull and heavy after the greatest mercies. Do
it therefore whilst thy heart is hot, and thy feeling sweet of his fouour
found. Do it quickly and heartily: and so thou mouest the Lord to more mercy.
For gratiarum actio est ad plus dandum inuitatio, Thankfulness is an inuiting of
God to give more, says S. Ambrose. Do what we can, we shall be weak, and
our best duties be full of wants: but yet speed will help somewhat, and our
care in making speed shall find mercy for such wants. When dullness crept in
by careless delay, shall be punished.

3. Note with your self again the manner of their Song; namely, how they being
many, yet use ye singular number, and say, I will sing: When in a right phrase
of speech they should have said, we will sing. This plainly teaches us that a
good form of giving thanks is, every particular person out of his own feeling
to say I, I, good Lord do yield unto thy Majesty, my bounden thanks for my
self and for my brethren, for my self and for thy whole Church. And so every
one feeling, and every one thanking, the Lord is praised of all, as his mercy
and goodness reach To all. A contrary course it is, to trust to other men's
giving of thanks for me, and to be dull and dumb my self. David's words have
another touch, Thou art My God, and I, I will praise Psalm. 118. 28.
thee, even My God: therefore I will exalt thee. I, I, again in mine own
person, and with mine own heart, and with mine own tongue, etc.

4. I will sing, that is, not only in heart will I feel and think; but with
my voice will I express and publish the due praises of such a God. Outward
signs shall go with inward truth: that both outwardly and inwardly I may do
my duty. As I am glad that men see his goodness to me; so think I it fit they
should also behold my duty to him. I publish the one, I will not hide the
other; I am glad of the one, and far be it from me to be ashamed of the
other. David speaks of the great Congregation, and, I will sing in the
midst of his people.

5. To whom? To the Lord will I sing, who is the fountain: not to my self and
my wit, to my friends and my Fortune, to my bags and my baggage or any other
thing. No Creature with me shall rob him of his right, but to the Lord will I
sing. And why? For he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and him that rode
on him has He overthrown in the Sea: He, He, has done this for me, for us,
etc. The Lord is my strength and praise, and he is become ver. 2.
my salvation. Some put their trust in Chariots, and some in Horsemen; but we
will remember the Lord our God. Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and
makes Ier. 17. 5,
flesh his arm, and with draws his heart from the Lord. (...) Thus for men
to be a means to stir up women, and one woman to stir up another, Fathers
to move their Children, Mothers their Daughters, Masters their Servants, and
friends their friends, what a comfort is it where God grants it? Their
Timbrels and their daunces were according to the manner of those parts, a grave
and modest going in order with Songs and signs of joy; no light nor wanton
leaping, neither men and women together, as in the commandment against
Adultery has been showed. She is called Aarons sister, because Aaron was the
elder brother, yet she was Moses sister also.

The 2. part.
1. THese things thus ended concerning the Thanksgiving, from the Red Sea
they went into the Wilderness of Shur, and in three days travel they found no
water, afterward they found some, but it was so bitter they could not drink
it. A new trial of their Faith and patience: and we may well Note in it the
course of the life of a child of God in this world: even to pass from trial
to trial: and still to be tried one way or other: That Acts. 14. 22.
through many tribulations at length he may enter into the Kingdom of God:
and after many fights receive that Crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Judge, shall give at that day, unto all them that so have finished
their course in Faith, and love his appearing. In those hot Countries the want
of water is a greater affliction than else where: and yet great is the want of
it any where. But when they had found it, to have it so bitter, was cross unto
cross, making Moses words true, God took unto him a people by signs and
wonders, by war and might, by a stretched out arm, by great fear, and (now
mark) BY TEMPTATIONS. Yet should Deuteronomy. 4, 34.
all have been endured patiently, having such Tokens of his care for them. But
(alas) see what follows.

2. Then the people murmured against Moses, saying, ver, 24.
what shall we drink? Who would have thought it possible so soon after such a
glorious Deliverance for such infirmity to show it self again. But this is
man both to God and his Ministers: as soon as any contrary wind blows
against him. Truly therefore said the Lord of us, That our wickedness is great
in the earth, and all the Genesis 6. 5.
imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts only evil continually. Let it
strike us and humble us, that no man think he is supported. For certainly this
is our mold to murmr ever when we are displeased. Let the Mininister of God
observe this Nature, and be prepared for the like in his people, if occasion
serve. Moses was a great man, and full of all just matter of high reverence
with his Flock: yet we see how he is dealt with. As soon as any thing
touches them, WHY? WHY? and WHAT? WHAT? still flying upon him with their
venomed words of bitter impatiencie: and he must answer for all the trials it
pleases God to lay upon his Church, or any member thereof. A fitter course it
had been for a people so taught with passed favors, to have assured
themselves of future helps in Gods good time, and with patience and Faith to
have expected the same, assuring themselves that he never had done so great
things for them to give them over in any need. This is therefore their great
fault: and let it profit us never to offend so: But to look upon David that
good Pattern who reasoned soundly and comfortably, That he which had delivered
him from the Bear and the Lion, would also save him from that uncircumcised
Philistime: to look also upon S. Paul, who makes 2. Cor. 1. 10.
the same Argument, that God did deliver him, does deliver him, and hereafter
will deliver him assuredly. This, this is the right way, To remember how many
baskets full of broken meat were taken up: and never to fear any want where
such a powerful God is. To remember what God has done for me, and to make
that an argument both of my prayer and hope, as David does when he says, Thou
have set me at liberty when I was in trouble: Psalm. 4. 1.
have mercy upon me and help me. As for murmurings and repinings, faintings
and fearings, they offend God, they grieve his Minister, they shame our selves,
they offend the Church, and no way can they profit us, be they never so violent
and bitter. Blessed Jobs Speech therefore is a blessed practice for every good
man and woman, If the Lord should Job. 13 15.
kill me, yet will I put my trust in him.

3. What does poor Moses thus grieved again with a perverse People? surely
again he runs to his God and cries to him. And this still is the refuge of
the poor ver. 25.
Minister, and of all those that fear him. Use it and keep it, God is not as
man, to be weary; and thou shall find the fruit of it, as Moses did again
in this place. For upon this his crying the Lord showed him a Tree, which when
he had cast into the waters they were sweet: and the people drank of them,
with great contentment to their fill. Has not GOD then an issue for every
temptation, if we would expect it? Are not the Cries of his Servants heard?
and do not they cry to him when others murmr against him? Mark all these
things with your self, and be the better; for I pass them over with this
pointing at them. And for this tree, which being cast into the waters made them
sweet, take it for a most Excellent Figure of Jesus Christ our Savior, by
whom all bitter affliction is made sweet: and the sour curse of the Law
condemning all men without him, quite and clean taken away. For who is able
either to endure the cross or to taste of the Law without Christ; yet in him,
and by him both are sweet, affliction fitting us to Gods Kingdom, and the
Law teaching us what to do, and what to fly. Consider of these Marginall
Quotations by 1. Tim. 1. 8. Romans 3. 31. Gala^. 5. 14. Ephesi. (...). 10. 1.
These 4. 3.
your self, and add the like unto them. And touching these bitter waters,
mark how they are a means to discover the hidden bitterness which lay in the
hearts of these Murmurers; and think with your self, that even so does bitter
adversity in many men and women at this day, disclose secrets, and show them
to have weakness, before not known, or thought of. Secondly, Note how in
traveling to the Land of Canaan, we must assuredly pass by Marah, and there
we must make a pitching place for a time, till it shall please God to grant a
Remove. Bitter, bitter, and very bitter will the waters prove: but murmr we
not as these men did: for he that was so gracious as to make them sweet to
such Repiners, what will he do in his good time to us, if we patiently abide
his will: surely he will much more respect us, and even boast of our patience
to our eternal good; as he did of his servant Jobs righteousness. But now for
the tree; some ask, whether there were any such virtue in it by Nature to
sweeten waters? and if there were, what need God had to use any such means,
seeing with his only word he could have helped them? for answer whereunto,
it may first be said concerning the first, that the Lord has given most
excellent virtues to his creatures, beasts, herbs, plants, stones, trees,
and such like, thereby to show his mighty Arist. hist. animal. Pliny. Aeuan.
Zanch. de operibus. Leuinus Lemnius, etc.
power, wisdom, and mercy. As for beasts, their blood, their flesh, their
fat, etc, what virtues are in them? for herbs, some comfort and help the
brain, some the eyes, some the liver, some the heart, some one part, some
another, with most rare and sovereign qualities given them of GOD for this
end. The consideration whereof has greatly delighted many worthy persons, and
caused them both to speak and write of them with great pleasure, Methridates
that great King of Pontus, and of one and twenty Kingdoms more, for his
wonderful skill in herbs, and his sovereign remedy against poison and
contagious diseases, called after his name Methridate, is become in all Books
and Monuments of learning, renowned and famous. Lysimachus Eupator King of
Ilyricum, is said to have been most skillful in herbs. Artemisia the wife of
Mausolus King of Caria, was an excellent Lady for knowledge in herbs. Marcus
Valerius Coruinus, a worthy Roman was so delighted with the study of herbs,
that he withdrewe himself into ye Country where he might wholely (as it were)
dwell in his Garden. But what speak I of these, since we all know what is
written of Solomon? namely, how he wrote of all Trees from the Cedar which is
in Libanon, unto the Hyssop which springs out of the wall, that is, from the
highest to the lowest: he wrote of plants and herbs, besides of beasts,
fowls, creeping things and fishes, worthy Books no doubt, if it had pleased
God to let them continue to this day. The strange virtues of precious stones

have written, whom both with pleasure and profit we may read. Concerning all
which happy qualities Zanch de operibus Dei, etc.
vouchsafed to these Creatures, and even particularly of this wood we now
speak of, remember with your self that Notable Testimony of Jesus the son
of Syrach in his Book. The Lord, says he, has created medicines of Eccles.

the earth, and he that is wise, will not abhor them. Was not the water made
sweet with wood, that men might 5. 6.
know the virtue thereof? So he has given men knowledge, that he might be
glorified in his wondrous works. With such does he heal men, and takes away
their pains. 7. 8. Why God uses means.
Of such does the Apothecarie make a confection, etc. Such virtue therefore
was in ye wood given to it by God, who is the God of Nature, and gives all
these things. To the second (why God should use such means, being able with
his word to sweeten them?) true Answer may be made, that although God be able
to do all things by himself, yet chooses he often to work by means, and
that for our good. As first, that so he might teach us his Sovereign power
over all Creatures using them at his pleasure, when, and how, he shall best
like, and draw us to the true reverence and worship of him as Creator, Ruler,
Lord, and Governor of all the creatures. Secondly, that he might manifest by
this means his love and goodness to us much more, when he makes all his
creatures serve to our health, comfort, and good, and so draw and stir us up
to true thankfulness unto him for it. Thirdly, that he might teach us thus not
to abuse those his creatures, which with so excellent virtues and qualities are
created for us, to do us good. Fourthly, that we might learn by this means,
not to contemn second Causes and means, by abusing (through a vain
presumption) the holy Doctrine of his providence. For, when God himself is
pleased to use these instruments, who are we that we should reject them?
and if we do, what do we contemn and reject, but his Ordinance? Lewd and
wicked therefore are the Anabaptists: who, as of the soul, so of the body,
cast away the means of health: and yet say, they desire the health of both. S.
Augustines words I cannot pass over, (fit for them, and fit for us in this
matter) in his whole 29. Chapter of the 7. Book of the City of GOD, showing
how God uses second causes in the government of the Of second causes.
world, because he has created them to that purpose. Yet ever he does not tie
himself to these things, but sometimes without them, and even contrary to
them, he works his will also: that thereby we might learn, his using of
them to be without need, seeing he can work without them, if he please.
Secondly, that when he uses them, it is he that works by them, and not they
without him; as he gives light in the Sun, he feeds us in our meat, etc.
For if without them it be he, much more in them and by them it is he. Thirdly,
that we might see how many ways he is able to help us, when any thing is
wanting unto us which is needful. And this we may well think was the cause
here, why it pleased GOD to show this Tree, that they might be ashamed of
their impatiencie and mistrust, never more so sinning again; seeing (by one
means, or other) there is with him ever so ready and easy help. Yea this is
the cause also why (even contrary to Nature) he works often; that neither to
Nature we should tie him, despairing of health, wealth, or liberty when we see
no means, or means (in reason) working to the contrary; forasmuch as he is
stall about all, and can with means, and without means, agreeably to Nature,
and contrary to Nature, give his Name praise, and his children comfort in a
moment. Profit we therefore thus by this Tree showed to Moses in extremity to
make the waters sweere withal.

4 There he made them an ordinance and a law, Ver. 25. and. 26.
and there he provoked them, and said, If thou will diligently hearken, O
Israel, unto the voice of the Lord thy GOD, and wilt do that, which is right
in his fight, and wilt give ear unto his Commandments, and keep all his
Ordinances; then will I put none of these diseases upon thee, which I brought
upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that heals thee. Where the Lord tried
them by want of water, there he also admonished them by his Word, declaring
unto them their inst deserving of such Plagues and diseases as were inflicted
upon the Egyptians: from which they had been free hitherto, only by his free
mercy and goodness; and acquainting them that ye only way for them so to
continue still, was to hearken to his Will, and to obey the same; otherwise he
being the only Author of health, it could not be so with them. Which word of
his, let it inform us what also is our defense from all evil, certainly even
the same LORD, and none but He. The way also to obtain it the very same that
was then, To hearken and to obey not our wills but his, not our wisdoms but
his, (...) our laws but his. This, this shall abide, and (...) and only this.
All man's devises, and will worship shall varnth as vile from before him.
Consider well of the Psalm, where first is put Ps. 2. 103. 3. Eccles. 3^.
forgiveness of Sins, and then the healing of all infirmities.

5. Then came they to Elim where were twelve fountains Ver. 27. Hirom. of 12.
Disciples, etc.
of water and seventy Palm trees: and they camped there, by the waters. So
comes comfort after sorrow, and plenty after scarcety. For now they have 12.
fountains of water and goodly trees to yield them cooling shadows for their
comfort. And surely the trialls of the Church, or of any particular member
therein, shall have a joyful end: and though they be never so many, yet the
Lord delivers out of them all. Who would not trust then in such a God, and
tarry his time that never fails. God, for his mercy sake, give us faith and
constant patience,

Amen, Amen.
CHAP. 16.
The general Heads of this Chapter are chiefly these. The grievous murmuring
of these Israelites. The gift of Manna from heaven. The laws and Orders
concerning the same.


1. BEfore their murmuring, there is in ye first verse mention made of another
camping, namely in the Wilderness of Sin, which was the 8. place they had
pitched in, since their coming out of Egypt. And in the book of Numbers a
particular Record is made of all the places together, as likewise in an Numb.
33.
other place of that Book. That at the commandment Chap. 9. 18.
of the Lord they iournied, and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched.
By all which we comfortably may see, that the Tabernacles or Tents of the
Church, and every particular member, are pitched where the Lord will, and
taken-vp and removed when he will, and whither he will. For he it is that
governs and guides all these things, even as he does all other matters in
this world, and nothing is done without his Will. The lot is fallen to me
(says the Prophet David) in a fair place: I have a goodly heritage: Thereby
ascribing to the Lord this honor, that by him every man's portion and place in
this world is appointed. He divided the Land of Canaan, and gave to every Tribe
that part which by his servant Jacob he had foretoldlong before. Which doctrine
may yield every heart patience and peace, to be quiet and contented with Gods
Will howsoever it be. For beggars may be no choosers; and we are all his
beggars that rules these things. Have I little? it is his Will, and I ought to
be pleased. Have I more? it is more mercy, and God make me thankful. Thankful
for the one, and thankful for the other, and ever contented with his Will. My
pitching is here, or there, by his providence, in a fair house, or a foul; in
a rich living or a small; in a good country, or a bad; in England or in
France: and wheresoever, or howsoever, it is above my merit; and therefore I
should be pleased, and thankful.

2 The time is named, to wit, the fifteenth day; to let us all know that even
so much more detestable was their ingratitude, by how much the remembrance of
so great and wonderful a deliverance from their enemies was more fresh in
me(...)rye, being solate. And will it not be so in us? Therefore, thus w^ulde
I have us profit by it, even to think in the Morning of our safety by his
mercy all the Night: And at Night of our safety all the day: And still (...)
of fresh favors; which unless I be thankful for, I must nee^^s be: a
great offender, seeing it is not possible to plead forgetfulness in such
fresh and new things: Nay, if it were a fault in these Israelites to forget
or to be dull in a matter of fifteen dayesolde, how much greater a fault in
the morning to forget to be thankful for the nights mercy last before, and
but even now ended: but you see my drift, follow it further by yourselfe.
Surely, surely, fresh favors would have fresh remembrances and zealous and
hearty thanks for them.

us to be considered. A foul and grieuious fault ever: but in this people so
blessed with happy experiences of care and love, of might and mercy in their
Allsufficient GOD, more (...)nable and more odious than in others. Whereupon
the Apostle gives them for an example to all people in all ages to learn to
avoid this wickedness, saying, Murmr nor, as some of them 1. Cor. 10. 10.
murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. Numb. 14. 36. For all these
things came upon them for examples, and were written to admonish us, upon
whom the ends of the world are come. The whole course of Gods sacred
Scriptures cries out of this sin in men and Women, chiefly professing God.
For do al things, says Phil. 2. 14.
ye same Apostle, without murmuring and reasoning. And S. Peter, Bey^
harb^^durs one to an other without murmuring. 1. Pet. 49. Wisdom. 1. 10.
The care of Jealousy says Wisdom, hears all things, and the noise of
grudgings shall not be hid. Therefore beware of Murmuring which profits
nothing; 11.
and refrain your ^onge from slander: for there is no word so secret; which
shall got for naught, and the mouth that speaks lies, flayeth the soul.
Caine murmured, and the Scripture notes it as his sin. These Genesis 4. 14.
Israelites were grievous murmurers, sometimes for their labor Exodus 5. 21.
, sometimes for drink Exodus 16. 25. Exodus 17. 3.
, sometimes for flesh Exodus 16
, sometimes in distrust to obtain the City so strongly walled, Number. 13. 31.
sometimes for fear to be killed of their enemies, Numb. 14 2.
sometimes at GODS justice upon their disobedient brethren, Number. 16. 42.
sometimes for want of dainties, as Figs, Pomegranats Uines, etc. Numb. 20. 3.
sometimes, for that they were ouerdoied with Manna (...), and for other like
causes: upon all which the Holy Ghost sets a brand of dislike: and so by
their sin admonishes us to beware. Miriam murmureth against her brother
Moses the Lords faithful Number. 12. 1. 10
Servant; and how fearfully was she smitten with a Leprosy? Let this sinite
the heart of every Christian Reader, and make him consider what may quickly
happen to himself, if he be a murmurer. From the Old Testament come to the
New, and observe as much. The Pharasies murmr at Christ his mercy to poor
Publicans: there is murmuring for good done on the Sabbath day: For not washing
before meat: that such as came late had a penny as well as those that had borne
the heat of the day: that the ointment was powered upon Christ, and not rather
sold, and given to the poor: that the Widows were neglected: and that Mary
does not help Martha, but sit and hear Christ's words. But still observe how
all these were sinful and grievous to God; and what a diligent record is made
of them and of the several causes; that we might learn and see no cause to
warrant this lewd behavior. For either all or most of these occasions might
have much said in defense of them. And therefore these Quotations of Scripture
with that of Jude, short and I(...). ver. 1^.
sharp: These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts:
whose mouths speak proud things, having men's persons in admiration, because
of advantage, etc. Murmurers and grudgers, and complainers, such as mutter, and
murmr, and grudge and groan, if all things fall not out to their contentment,
such as mislike their places and callings, Estats and conditions, and are
angry with God if in all things he please not their humors. If they be
restrained of liberty, if they be touched with poverty, if they be pinched with
penury, if they be subject to affliction and adversity, if they be not in
highest places, and eralted to greatest authority, they ^ret, they ^ume, they
are offended and discontented with ye Highest. These are the greedy dogs spoken
of by David, which run about the City, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
Irenaeus the ancient Father gives them a fit name (but a foul Irenaeus lib.

name) calling them or a Piaboli, the Devils mouths. And the words of Plato
are as fit of unbridled mouths sendingout injury both to Heaven and Earth. The
end of which mouths Euripides by the light he had, could well discern, that it
would be misery and woe, as indeed it will, try who list. Circumstances
increase this sin very much; as Who numbreth? against whom? and in what
matter? who murmureth? A subject, a son, a friend, to whom much favor many
ways has been showed; A professor of the Gospel, well acquainted with the
Word, and upon whom many eyes are cast etc. Against whom? Against Prince,
against Parents, against Friends, to whom obedience, duty, and love with all the
Testimonies thereof are due, and most due; against God, whose Word is in our
hands, and in our mouths, and whose servants we would gladly be esteemed. In
what matter? In a small matter, in a trifle; and wherein, or for what, we ought
rather give thanks, in a matter lawful, tolerable, good, and no way to be
grudged at. These and such like Circumstances I say make the fault much fouler
and greater. Old Writers have uttered these kinds in these words, Est
murmuratio contra Deum per displicentiam, contra Praelatumper inobedientiam,
and contra proximu^ per inuidentiam. There is a murmuring against God by
coffeehouse, against our superior by disobedience, and against our Neighbor
by envy. But from what fountain flows all this filthy water which so
offends God, so grieueth man, and so infecteth the very air? Surely either
from impatience, or from pride, both bad and very bad fountains. Of the first
that was an example in the Acts of the Apostles about the Widows of the
Graecians: For not able with patience Acts. 6. 1.
to endure their conceited grief, till there might be declaration made
thereof, and order taken accordingly, they fell to secret carping and biting
unfit for the professors of the Word: and in that heat touched even the
Apostles themselves with want of care. Of the later, that is a most fearful
example in Numbers of proud Corah and his company, whose pride, envy and
ambition brought them to so strange and dreadful a death. They grieved that
Moses should have such authority, they thought them selves worthy of some of
it, and what they thought fit, not what pleased him, God must do. Of which
kind of Murmurers and enuiers Saint Gregory has a good saying in his
Morales, Qui contra suprapositam sibi potestatem murmurat, liquet, quoa^
umredarguit qui eandem potestatem dedit: Who so murmereth against authority set
over him, it is manifest, that he reproves him who gave the same authority.
And upon the seventh Psalm, murmurantes dicuntur intrare in iudicium cum Deo:
Murmumurers are said to enter into indgment with GOD: They are like, says An
other to a filthy sooyne, who whether he wake or sleep is ever grunting.
Murmuratores similes sunt versantibus in gyrum, donec capite and sensibus
perturbaris caetera omnia perturbari putant, Murmurers are like unto such as
turn round about til their heads and senses being turned, they imagine al things
to turn round. Pythag.
Sednoli aduersus quemquam murmunare, est enim abiectorum: But be not thou a
murmurer against any man, for it is a base thing, and the quality of a base
person. Erratapropria magis Democritus.

Ediscat non murmurare, qui mala patitur, etiam si ignoret curmal patirur: per

iudicia nunqua^ sunt iniusta; And let him that suffers harm not murmur;
although he know not the cause why he suffers it: because every man may
think he suffers justly, seeing he is judged of him, whose judgments are

never unjust. A very notable sentence, if you mark it; not allowing this vice
in our hardest estate; and when we know not any reason of it. Qui in poenis
murmurat fertentis iustitiam accusat: for he that murmureth at Gods
punishment, or any just punishment, accuses the justice of him that punishes.
But go we forward. Felicity consists not in things of this life: therefore
we should not murmr for the want of them. Job blesses the Name of God Job.

said, The praise of GOD is ever in their mouths: Then not murmuring.
Murmurers want David's staff so comfortable to him, therefore we should avoid
it. No Artificer can like that his work be dispraised of one which has less
skill, or evil will: And shall God like to have his predestination, his
providence, his justice and mercy and whatsoever is holy, and good to be
censured, and grudged at by dust and ashes? No, no. The Wise man's Counsel is
excellent in this behalf: Hearken unto me, ye holy children, and bring forth
fruit, as the Rose Sirach. 39. 13.

this? wherefore is that? For at time convenient they shall all be sought out,
etc. Read the whole Place your self I pray you. And see how far this is from
murmuring and grudging. Optimumest pati quod emendare non potes, and Deum, quo
authore cunctaproueniunt, sine murmuratione comitari, It is best, says Seneca,
to suffer what thou can not amend, and to follow God (from whom, as from a
fountain, all things do come) without murmuring. Malus est miles qui
imperatorem sequitur gemens, He is a very bad Soldier that follows his
General with grumbling. And certainly he is as bad a Christian, that
controuleth God in his works; and thinks this, or that, might be better.
Some will have fair weather, and some will have foul; some wet and some dry;
some dearth, and some plenty: who can repeat men's vain conceits herein,
never caring for others, but for themselves: and therein also mightily
deceived, because man indeed is not able to comprehend, what will ever be
best for him. Holcot upon the Book of Wisdom tells a Tale of an Heremit,
that having Lect. 9.
sowed pot-hearbs in his Garden, desired fair weather, and foul weather as
he judged to be best for his herbs, and so had still granted of God
according to his request, but not one herb came up: whereupon he thought,
there was a general failing in all places of such herbs, till on a time
walking to another Heremit not far off, he saw with him a very excellent crop:
Then he told him what he had begged, and obtained, touching the weather, and
what effect it had. Whereunto the other Heremit answered, Putahas te
sapientiorem Deo, and ipse estendit tibi fatuitatem tuam, etc. Thou did
think thy self wiser than God, and he has showed thee thy folly. I for my
crop never asked any other weather than GOD should please to send. I would this
old Heremit might teach many in our days to be less wise in their own
conceits, concerning both weather, and other matters: and to rely more upon
Gods merciful providence and bottomless wisdom, that he both knows what
is best for man's use, and will accordingly (for his own goodness) vouchsafe the
same. Then would there not be so many faithless fears and doubts amongst us
as are, much less any opening of our mouths against Heaven, as, I fear, is.
But let such remember what Seneca writes of Caesar, who having appointed a
great Feast for his Nobles and friends of all degrees, and it falling out that
the day was so extreme foul as nothing could be done, being highly displeased
at it, in extreme madness willed all them that had bows to shoot up their
arrows at Jupiter in defiance of him, for that foul weather. Which when they
accordingly did, their arrows lighting short of Heaven, fell down upon their
own heads, and hurt a number of them very sore. Even so do our muttering and
murmuring words, either for this or that which God sends, not hurt him but
wound our selves both deeply, and dangerously. Another desire of men is, ^uer
to be in prosperity, and not to taste of any adversity; if they do, then
they murmr, and then they grudge, saying, or thinking the Lord deals
hardly. But these men forget that if the Physician desire a man's life and
health, he restrains him of many things wished and longed for, and ministers
many things unto him bitter and unpleasant; whereas, if he despair of the
parties well doing, he suffers him to eat and drink what he will. They
forget that those Cattle which the Grasier puts into his best Pastures and
feeds fat, are usually appointed to the slaughter. They forget that too much
rancknesse hurts the corn, and too much fruit breaks the trees. They
forget that Christ gave both a sop and a dipped sop to Judas, and yet he was a
reprobate; the rest (being chosen vessels) had no such thing. A whirle wind
carried Elias to Heaven, and so has affliction many an one. But the Rich
Glutton that had all pleasure in his life time, lost his pleasure, and gained
woe for ever. It is not good to have our wages too soon, but to remember
cheerfully, that when the day is ended, then wages will be paid. He that
trauelleth in the way against the Sun, has the light before him, and the
shadow behind him: so have the wicked prosperity and comfort here, none
hereafter. But he that trauelleth with the Sun has the shadow before him,
and the light after him: so have the godly crosses here and eternal joy
after. Murmr not therefore at any wants, neither grieve if other: be made
rich, and the glory of their houses increased: for as thy shadow goes before,
so will thy light follow: And as his light is before, so will his shadow
follow most assuredly. Nothing shall he carry with him when he dies, neither
shall his pomp follow him. Qui honoratur in via, in peruentione ^^m^abitur,
Et quasi per amaena pratain carcerem Greg. Moral.
venit, qui per prosperitatem praesentis vitae ad interitum tendit. He that is
much honored in the way, at the end of his journey is damned. And as it were
through a fair pasture he passes to a prison, who by the prosperity of this
life present goes to destruction and confusion. It is enough (if any Counsel
may be enough) to banish from us ali sinful murmuring either at other men's
prosperity, or at our own adversity. For certainly as your self would be
more careful of a child of yours that you had done little or nothing for,
than of one that was provided for, and had plenty: so is the Lord of Heaven
(that kind Father above all Fathers) most careful of their good, who here in
this life have had least, and are indeed yet unprovided for. O believe it,
they shall have a day, and that a sweet day and a joyful. Their turn will
come, and though others have been scrued before them, yet shall their portions
at last be as Beniamins was with Joseph, greater and better than all the rest.
Till then let your want make you as hunger does yt Hawke, fly more earnestly
at your pray, that is, at Heaven, at God, at Christ, at the life to come with
all his joys. Pitch your eyes upon it and your heart also; fly, and fly
strongly to that mark, thinking every day two, til the Lord grant it. If a
traveler have but a little money left to bring him home, he trauelleth
farther in a day than otherwise he would: And so do you by your present
wants, take occasion to go forward faster and faster in a holy course, that
you may be at home and take your rest. Away with murmuring and all evil
speaking, (...)
for a man is known by his speech as metal is by his ring. And no glass
shows more plainly the spots of your face, than your tongue will show the
spots of your heart. Let it grieve you to hear others do it: for the Lord
is not with them: And to be sorry for a body, from which the soul is
departed, and not for a soul from which Aug. Non sunt inte viscera pietatis,
si ploras corpus a quo anima, and non animam a qua Deus recessit.
God is departed, is not piety, says S. Augustine. Foolish men speak
foolishly, but our speech should be with a grain of salt. S. Augustine notes
it very well, that S. James does not say None can tame, but no man can tame the
tongue, that when it is tamed, we might know it to be a work of God, and not
of man. It is walled in which two walls, the lips and the teeth, to note a
double trial that should be taken of our words before we speak. First,
whether it be lawful; secondly, whether it be expedient that we mean to say.
And if both these, then speak on and spare not, all shall be well. But if
either of these want, then keep the door fast, and let not that little member
have his will. The good Abbot saw both the good, and the difficulty of this,
who being unlearned, and very desirous to be instructed, when he was come to
that verse of the Psalm (I said I will look to my ways, that I offend not
in my tongue) bad Stay there, till he had learned that lesson, which he feared
would be both hard, and long. But happily I am too long also in this point, and
therefore I shut up with this wish, that no tongue may be like that cursed Bay
tree whereon the Proverb grew, Insana laurus, The contagious bay tree. My
meaning is, that no man or woman have a tongue so venomous to make murmuring
wheresoever it is, as that bay tree would make chiding and strife, as long as
any jot of it were in ones hand: for you see the sin of such a tongue, and
let it suffice. God sees, and God hears, who as Augustine says, is every
where, and cannot be mocked. But happily you Aug. Deus vbique est, intra omnia
non inclusus, extra omnia non exclusus, supra omnia non elatus, infra omnia non
depressus.
will think, why then does God suffer any murmuring to be? And I pray you
remember Saint Gregory his Answer, Permittitur murmurati^ and detractio, vt
caueatur elatio, GOD suffers murmuring and detraction, that it may keep
down in men pride and arrogancy. Thus much of this matter of Murmuring, if
not too much, of purpose enlarged, because the fault is too general both in
persons murmuring, and in matters murmured at.

4. But did they all murmr without exception? No: but although yt Text make
no exception, yet we may safely think, the Lord had his number among them that
did not murmr at all. Yet forasmuch as this number was very small in
comparison of the Murmurers, therefore there is no mention made of it, but all
in general are said to murmr. And indeed what are the godly but as wheat
hid under a great heap of chafe, which does not appear so well, till the
chafe be wynowed and blown away? It was sufficient that the Lord well
discerned both, etc.

5. The words of their Murmuring are expressed in the 3. verse, Oh (say they)
that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the Land of Egypt, when we fate by
the fleshpots, when we ate bread our bellies full! for ye have brought us
into the Wilderness to kill this whole company with famine. Words of such
impiety, as I know not how to begin to speak of them. O impiam et nefandam
vocem! O wicked and horrible words! (says a godly Interpreter) O sinful and
cursed speech! may all that read it, and taste of GOD say; especially in this
people so acquainted with Gods mercy, grace, and power, so made famous over the
world with miracles wrought for them against their enemies. For, what is this
which they say? but all one as if they had said; we care not for our
Deliverance out of Egypt, and from all the bondage and cruelty against us and
our Children, we give GOD no thanks for it, for we were better so, than
thus; O, that he had let us alone by the fleshpots, and come to deliver us
when we had sent for him. Such height of unthankful contempt who trembles
not to read, and shakes not to think of in his heart? But let it profit us;
for to that end the Lord has Chronicled it in his Book. First then, let it
teach us and tell us, yea soundly settle in us, how quickly these sinful
hearts of ours slip from their duties, if once any cross lay hold on us,
making those mercies and benefits of God vile, and of no account, which at the
first when we received them were most great in our eyes, most welcome and
acceptable; we then saying, O, how should we thank the Lord enough for these
things! But is this well? Does the word teach us thus? or do we our selves
endure this measure to be measured to us by those to whom we have been good
and kind unto? No, no: And therefore abhor it as most odious both to God and
man: and look we at the Rule which teaches us otherwise. Great were the
favors that Job had received from his God: adversity comes, and that (as
you know) in a great degree. Does Job vilify therefore either in tongue or
heart those former favors, and say, O, that God had never bestowed them on me?
No, you know, but holily and virtuously he embraces Gods will, and tells his
repining wife, That since they had in former times received good things from
God, should not they also receive evil, when it was his pleasure? Yes, yes:
And therefore says he, The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken: and blessed,
blessed be the Name of the Lord even in taking, as well as giving, and ever for
all things that he does. The Apostles of Christ were exalted by him to the
highest dignity in his Church, it was no doubt a great grace unto them and
very acceptable, but afterward comes persecution, imprisonment, whipping, and
many crosses; Do they then say as these Israelites, (O, that we had died by
the hand of the Lord! O, that we had never been Apostles!) and so cast the
mercies of God in his face for the troubles which followed such favor? Not so,
you see, but they went away rejoicing, that they were made worthy to suffer
those Acts, 5. 41.
things for so kind a Lord as had exalted them to that dignity, and given
unto them such graces and places as then they had. Let us look upon such
Examples as these, and pray to God for strength to follow them. Let us often
remember that good Counsel of the wise man, My son, if thou will come into
the service of GOD, stand fast in Sirach. 2. 1.

Disciples hearts, and exhorted them to continue in the faith; affirming that
we must through many afflictions enter into the Kingdom of God. There are
many such places in Scripture. Away then with those crooked ways Math. 16. 23,
2. Tim. 3, 12.
wherein too many do walk: and be taught by these Examples what ever to do.
The Gospel is welcome to many at the first, and they greatly rejoice in it;
but when either trouble grows for it, or they are restrained by it from their
accustomed sins of swearing, drunkenness, sensuality, covetousness,
oppression, usury, and such like, then they wish they had never been troubled
with such preaching, and all Gods mercy is returned to him with great
unthankfulness, as here it was of these murmuring Israelites. If authority and
offices either in Church or Commonwealth be given in Gods goodness to some men,
they receive them joyfully, and say they are much bound to God for them: But
when such things happen as usually follow such places, to wit, trouble and
charge, lies and slanders, contumelies and reproaches, with great
unthankfulness then they turn both tongues and hearts, and wish they never had
been so graced. For Matches and marriages, O, what impiety is in many, many
times! cursing the parties, and almost cursing God that gave them such a match:
when yet at the beginning all was well, and euerybody pleased. Let all these
and all others faulty in like sort look upon these murmuring Israelites, and
be ashamed of such sin. For man and wife, let them consider but one thing
which GOD has given them in their own bodies, and see how it will instruct
them. Their two eyes if they go together and look both one way, be it upward
or downward, to the right hand or to the left, All is well and comely in the
face. But if they be severed and the one eye look one way, and the other an
other, there is a blemish we all confess, and it is not well: So man and Wife
who as the two eyes are made to look one way, should never be severed to go
a sunder, to cross one an other, to reproach one an other, to shame one an
other, to breake-vp house and depart one from another. Surely the blemish is
great, and as many as care either for piety or honesty, will consider of it.
Secondly, these words of the Israelites may show us what is the course of too
many Men and Women in the world another way, even to pre^er the fleshpots of
Egypt before the Land of Canaan, and bellies full of bread before a blessed
deliverance out of cruel bondage, that is, Earth before Heaven, and the joys
of this world before all that can be given when this life is ended. A
miserable and monstrous blindness, yet such as no persuasion will prevail
against, it is so settled and rooted in sinful hearts. Remember what you read
in the 11. of John, when Christ had raised up Lazarus to life again, And many
that had seen these things believed on Ioh. 11 44. 45. 47. 48
him: Then gathered the high Priests a Council, and said, what shall we do?
If we let this man thus alone, all men will believe in him (now mark) and the
Romans will come and take away both our Place, and Nation. So before Christ
they prefer their places, and for the world adieu to Heaven. Such others were
those in the Prophet Jeremy, who measured Religion by plenty and scarcity,
judging that best which brought most profit, and that worst wherein there was
any want. The word which thou have spoken (say they) to us in the Name of the
Lord, we will not hear of thee, But we will do whatsoever 17.
thing goes out of our own mouth, as to burn incense to the Queen of
heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, both we
and our Fathers, our Kings and our Princes, etc. For then had we plenty of
victualles and were well, and felt no evil. But 1^
since we left off to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out
drink offerings unto her, we have had scarsenesse of all things, and have
been consumed by the sword and by famine. But if you read the rest of the
Chapter, you shall see that their Plagues grew because they sinned against the
Lord, and would not be ruled by his Word, to worship him, and him only,
according to his Word. Such Arguments made the Heathen against the Christians
in former times, as witnesses Tertullian, Cyprian, and others; attributing all
Tertul. Apologet. 51. Si Tybris exundat, si grando, si gelu. etc. Cypr. ad
Demetrianum.
calamities (that happened) to the Christians: because that they worshipped not
the Idols of the Heathens: but they answered even as Jeremy, that such
calamitles fell, because they (the Heathens) would not forsake their Idols, and
embrace Gods true Religion, and so indeed they did. Such words, and even the
very self same words, use the Papists against us, and the Gospel at this day:
telling us often and too often (unless it were truer) how great plenty was in
former times when Popery swaied, how many eggs forsooth for a penny, and all
this gear; grounding an argument thereupon, that therefore that was truth, and
this is falsehood, even as Heathenish and Jewish Idolaters did before them. But
with Jeremy and the godly Fathers we truly inuert their argument upon them:
that their contempt of truth, and foul Idolatry in despite of truth provoke
God to many crosses, and will yet provoke him further if they continnue without
amendment. And touching their pretended plenty when Popery ruled, we say it is
a Tale, for as great dearth was then as since. Touching our own country of
which I chiefly speak, let them remember what our Chronicles note in Richard
the first his time, how sharp a scarcity there was by the space of three or
four years. What a Summer that was in Edward the 3. his time, called the
dear Summer. In Richard the 2. his time what a dearth, when the people
wereforced so to feed upon fruit to sustain Nature, as that thereby many
fell into fluxes, and dyed. How the childrens cries were so pitiful for the
want of food which their Parents had not to give them, as a stony heart could
not endure to hear. Of Henry the sixth his time, when people were forced to
make bread of Fearne roots. And (to go no further) of Acrone bread in Queen
Mary's time. Were there now so many eggs a penny, and all cheap, cheap? Yet
Popery swaied in blinded hearts too much. No, no, The calamities which have
been in places where this Ignorance ruled, have been equal or greater than
under the Gospel, ever, as all Stories tell us. Has Rome it self never been
affected? has the Pope himself never been taken prisoner? Have Romish wars
euerprospered, or Popish conspiracies had their wished effects? Blessed be the
God of Heaven for it, they know the contrary. And that Spanish, Romish, and
Devilish attempt in the year 1588 yeildeth them matter of wisdom, (if God so
please,) and us eternal cause of thanksgiving unto God for it. Ever praised
from our heart roots be the glorious Name of him that so respected us. But yet
this is not the matter; for if they had ever had plenty, and ever scarcity,
true Religion is not measured by the belly, by fleshpots or great leaves, or
any outward prosperity or adversity, but by the Rule which God has left us in
his holy Scriptures; Therefore although we could object Esaias. 8. 20.
unto them the unspeakable blessings of God upon this Land of ours, and
thereupon reason as Gamaliel did; yet do we not: but throwing our selves
down at his feet, who gave them all, we rest our selves upon his Word: and
so both know truth, and hate error, as in mercy he enableth, leaving
fleshpots and all fleshly reasons to such doughtie disputers as they are, that
stand upon such arguments: and to strengthen our hearts against this great
sin here noted in the Israelites, Weelooke upon Demas; whose shame lives in
Gods Book for embracing Read Ba^ils Tract. Non adhaerendum rebus secularibus.

the world, and forsaking Paul. We think upon that fearful cry, One drop
of water to cool my tongue: When all the pleasures of the world which either
he had, or we can have, could not help. And as Elias covered his face with
his mantle, so do we hide our eyes from beholding this world and the deceipts
thereof. We assure our selves Saint Hierom said true: Difficile, immo
impossible est, vt praesentibus quis and futuris fruatur bonis, vt his ventrem
ibi mentem impleat, vt de delitijs transeat ad delitias, vt invtroque seculo
primus sit, vt and in coelo and in terra appareat gloriosus. It is hard, yea it
is impossible that one should enjoy both present and future good things, that
here he should fill his belly, and there his mind; that from pleasure he
should pass to pleasure, that in both worlds he should be chief, and both in
earth and heaven appear glorious. So we leave the fleshpots of Egypt to all
earthly Israelites, and beseech the Lord to bring us to his kingdom, although
it be through many tribulations.

6. Then said the Lord to Moses, behold, I will cause Ver. 4.
bread to rain from heaven to you, and the people shall go out, and gather
that which is sufficient for every day, etc. O Admirable Mercy, and
bottomless Fountain of all comfort, and pity! Will he now rain bread from
heaven to these ungrateful Murmurers, who much rather should have been
destroyed from the face of the earth? Let never penitent sinner than despair
of mercy, let never troubled spirit cast away comfort. For how can the sighs
of a groaning heart sorrowing for sin be neglected of so sweet a God, when
such proud offenders find mercy? never, never can it be, assure your self.
Therefore lay up this place in your mind, and feeling your self grieved
either for things committed, or omitted, be not too much shaken as one out of
hope, but with faithful assurance say cheerfully, O kind Father, and sweet
GOD, do not cast away thy creature, that cries, and flies unto thy mercy. I
am unworthy full well I know it, but thy goodness has no bottom, and with
joy I remember it; These murmurers and complainers against thy mercies thou
yet shewedst more mercy unto, and thy poor servant suing for grace will thou
clean reject? No dear father thy nature is not so, and therefore by this
favor to the^, I gather comfort: and beseech thee to be as thou have ever
been, my kind, my gracious and loving Lord.

7 And can God rain bread from heaven? why then we all see that albeit the
fields should fail, and the whole earth grow barren, yet can the Lord nourish
his people, Greg. Nazian. calls these works of God, quae supraleges naturae
ac facultatem hominum facit, (...), Dei pore^tias: Quas nos mentis
intellige^tia nequaequam consequi possumus.
and send food to al those that trust in him. It is most true, and it is most
comfortable, leaving no cause why we should in any distress be cast down too
much, seeing the Lord is not tied to ordinary means, nor our maintenance to
the fruits of the earth. The 1. King. 17. 4.
Ravens shall both find meat, and bring meat to Elias, if he command: and
2. King. 4. 4.
a little oil shall continue running till many vessels be full when he so
pleases. Infinite is his power, and infinite are his ways, to comfort them
that cleave to him. Lift up your thoughts therefore above the course of Nature
when you think upon GOD: and although you have neither bread nor money, nor
the whole land any corn; yet past hope take hold on hope take hold on hope:
and leave God to himself. Jacob was provided for in that extreme Genesis 47. 11.
Math. 2. 11.
famine, and Gold was brought to Mary and Joseph from far, when they thought
not of it. What the LORD will do, he can do, and on our parts Faith only
is required: that we may see his Glory and incomprehensible mercy.

8 But why did not God thus comfort his people before they murmurd? Surely
because he might open unto them the hidden corruption of their nature, and so
make them see, and all posterity also, that not merit in them, but mercy in him
drew all the favors that were showed to them. And remember ever this use of
affliction, how it is often sent of God to discover us, not unto him who
knows us well, but to our selves who dote upon our worth, and think we are
far otherwise than we are; yea, and to the world also, which many times is
deceived by our golden show. Stand we therefore always upon our watch, when
the cross knocks at our doors, and know there is a spic e^tered and a very
tel-tale. He will look into us, draw-out from us what is within; our fair
looks shall not deceive him: but as we are he will make us show, yt we may be
known. How Job and his Wife differ he will describe: Job. 2. 9 10. Genesis 16 5.
Exodus 4. 25.
Sarais infirmity, and Zipporahs waspishnesse against their good husbands he
will open; and in one word, he will tell all. Pray we therefore with David
ever, O let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed. Sound
without glosing, faining and haulting; sound without grudging and inward
complainiug; that from soundness within may flow holiness without, even
patient comfort in Gods Will, and so no Shame grow where no shameless thing is
done, etc. The Lord grant it to us ever, Amen. The words in the 8. Verse,
(your murmurings are not against Ver. 8.
us, but against the Lord) notably may fear us from abusing of Gods Ministers:
and confer with them the words in Samuel, They have not cast thee away, but
they 1. Sam. 8. 7. Luke. 10. 1^
have cast me away: And the words in the Gospel, He that despises you,
despises me.

The 2. part.
In the Morning the dew lay round about the host. And Ver. 13. 14.
when the dew that was fallen was ascended, behold, a small round thing was
upon the face of the Wilderness, small as the hoare frost on the earth. And
when the children 15.
of Israel saw it, they said one to an other, it is Man, for they wist not
what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord has
given you to eat. Here is also mention made of Quails, ver. 13. but we will
respite that for an other place, and consider now only of Manna: wherein we
may observe many profitable and comfortable things.

1. Concerning the Name, it is somewhat obscure as it lies in our English;
They said it was Manna, for they wist not what it was, But the Hebrew makes it
very plain, wherein it is thus: They said this is Man, that is, as your
Mariginall Note has, a part, a portion, a gift, or meat prepared, for they
wist not what it was on the sudden, and at first sight, but a thing given or
prepared for Datum. Paratum.
them, that they knew it was. Or (which for my part I like better) They said
Mah hu, or Man hu, What is this? (...)? Qnid est hoc?
for they knew not what it was.

2 Concerning the manner of the coming of it some question is made, whether it
was natural, or miraculous? They that would have it natural, tell us of the
Manna of Arabia, which is sold in our Apothecaries shoppes, and say that out
of the earth there issues and comes dulcis halitus, a certain sweet
vapoure, which being drawn up by the heat of the Sun, is purged from his
gross earthlinesse, and made more pure and sweet, then with the cold of the
night is hardened, and before Morning falls down again upon the earth like
dew or the hoare frost, and so is gathered dried and kept as medecineable for
man's body. They say that is small and white, so was this; That falls down
with the dew, so did this; both of them sweet even as the honey, and happily
the substance of both, one, etc. But what of all this? Therefore shall it
follow that this was not given miraculously to the Israelites? nothing less.
For as they wear like in some things, so were they also unlike. This Manna in
the shoppes is not so sweet as this, given here, was: it melts not away
with the Sun as this did, neither is it so hard that it needs to be brayed
in a mortar, or ground on a mill as this was to make bread of it. This Manna
came not before a certain time, and hour, appointed by God and foretold by
Moses. No change of the air and alteration of the weather hindered the coming
of this Manna, but in Summer, in Winter, in Frost, in Rain, still still it
kept his course: and fell down every night against the morning for the space
of forty years together. The abundance of it was above any natural course
even enough to suffice for six hundred thousand men beside women and children,
so long. The sixth day it was doubled to them, that they might gather both for
that day and the next, which was the Sabbath: and so rest upon the Sabbath: a
very plain token that all was not natural. If upon any day they gathered more
than their limmitted proportion, it putrified and rotted, worms grew in it,
and it sauoured ill. But on the sixth day when they gathered double, it did not
so, but was very sweet and good, till the next day: yea a pot of it was kept
in the Arc, sweet and good, long, which would not have been so, if all had
been natural. Again wheresoever the Israelites were, it followed them: and
was about their tents, not in other fields and places remote from them. Now,
they that write of the Arabian Manna sold in shops, say it springs not out
of all earth, and by name, not out of desert places, but out of some certain
places only in Arabia, as we see in other matters some kind of earth yields
a sweeter, a fatter, and better sap than other earth does. But this Manna
followed the Israelites, whatsoever the earth was: and by name in the
wilderness and desert. No way therefore was this Manna altogether natural.
Lastly, when they came into the Land of Canaan, which was a more excellent
earth, presently it failed and came no more. A great miraculous work therefore
of God this Manna thus given from Heaven was, and so to be esteemed, that God
may have his due glory, and we such comfort and instruction as will flow from
it. A taste whereof in this that follows you may take.

The 3. part.
1. THey are commanded to go forth every morning to gather this Manna, and to
make them bread of it: which teaches us thus much, that as God does something
for his part toward the nourishing and maintaining of us, so will he have us
likewise again to do something for our parts. He will give Manna in his mercy
and goodness, but we must go out and gather it: That is, he will provide meat,
money, cloth, and all worldly matters for us, as shall be good for us, but we
must labor in some honest and lawful vocation, and so come by these things.
Idleness he will not foster nor abide in any man. Corn he will give to ye
Husbandman, but (conditionally) that he plough and sow. Riches he will give
to the Merchant, but so that he go to sea and take pains. Whereupon the
Heathens did say, Dij omnia vendunt laboribus, The Gods sell all things for
labor. And for the Scripture, it is plentiful in this point, as has been
showed elsewhere. Man in his innocence was appointed to dress the Garden,
and not suffered to be idle. Again, every man here was appointed to gather
Manna; which needed not, if God had liked of Ingrossers, to take up all into a
few hands, and then to deliver out to others as they please: but follow this
Note farther your self, and be bettered by it.

2. How much might every one gather? even so much says the Text, as is
sufficient for every day, ver. 4: that is, they shall provide for the day and no
more. Wherein Note how careful the Lord is to have men depend upon his
providence, with cheerful hope in his goodness, and not wretchedly and
despairefully to mucker up what shall never do them good, nor any peradventure
that they purpose it for. Thus is the prayer which our Savior taught us, Our
daily bread give us for the day. And from distrustful Luke. 11. 3.
fear the whole Scripture drives us in every place. He that feeds the
Sparrowe so small in price, and hears the young Ravens that call upon him, He
that opens his hand and fills all things living with plenteousnes, will he
either forsake or forget man or woman trusting in him? No; it is a Hellish
thought, and away with it for ever out of your heart. The life is far more
worth than meat; and the body than any raiment. We are much better than any
fowls, and yet the Lord feeds them, when they neither sow, nor reap, nor
carry in to any barnes. Could not God here have bidden them gather for many
days, if he had would, and lay up in store for a dear year, as we use to
speak? yet he would not, but tieth them to a days food, and for the next
day to depend upon him. He failed them no day, nor ever fails us if we
believe. Cast your care then cheerfully upon him, and cleave fast unto him,
you shall see his Mercy, you shall see his Truth, you shall see your Comfort. If
the earth yield neither corn, nor grass, and that for forty years together:
yet can he nourish you and yours with bread from Heaven, and the dainty flesh
of Quails at his pleasure. The hard Rock or the dry tooth shall yield drink
for your thirst, at his will. Elias had bread and meat brought him by the
wild Raven: And the little meal and oil in the Cruze wasted not till the
dearth was past, and so forth as you heard before. These Israelites garments
were not worn, nor the shoes of their feet torn in so many years: who then
will distrust such a GOD? He can do what he will do: and he will do what
is best, be ever assured with joy. Many a time has the poor woman had no
bread in the morning for her children, and before night, both bread and money.
Go farther your self, for this meditation is most sweet. That man lives
not, or ever shall, who cleaving to God, has been forsaken by him.

3. For the day then, how much might they gather? without stint? No. The Text
says, An OMER for a man, Ver. 16.
according to the number of the persons: this was the stint. Every man was to
take for them in his Tent. This OMER was about a pottle of our measure. Mark
how the Lord allows a sufficiency, and utterly disliketh all needelesse
superfluity. Our wanton wills he will not fellow: but our just need he will
supply. Would we learn this blessed mean in all our courses, God would joy
in it, and the child unborn be the better for it. Our houses and land would
tarry with us, and descend from us to them we love; our Tenants should taste
of better bargains, and live and die at our feet; the poor would send a
shreeking cry to the ears of God, for mercy and goodness to be poured upon us
for our relieuing of them; The Commonwealth should find us furnished, either
to defend, or offend upon occasion; and in one word, both Heaven and Earth be
glad of it. O, why, why then should not our OMER content us for the day? God is
wise that made this Law, and who ever followed his wisdom and repented? You
see the Note, and to a feeling heart I need not amplify it any farther.

4. But might they gather this pottle of Manna any time of the day? No. It was
to be gathered in the morning: Ver. 21.
for when the heat of the Sun came, it was melted. So God would teach them,
to take time whilst time served: And it may well admonish us to do the like.
We have a Morning, and we have an Evening. Our able youth and good health is
our morning* our feeble Age and sick estate is our evening. Spend not the
first vainly, and you shall not want in the last uncomfortably. God is good,
and gives us a gathering time, he looks we should use it as he intends,
that is, in the morning to go forth to our labor, honestly and truly to live
in a lawful vocation, to do what we are called to, faithfully and carefully.
So shall we eat the fruit of our labors when the evening of age and sickness
comes, and all shall be well. But a careless youth and an ill spent health
will make a wanting age, and an helpless sickness. Gods blessings are not at
our election to have them when we will, but when we seek when he bids, we
shall find. His Manna is ready if we come in time, and if we linger till we
list, he has his Sun to melt it away, and it is gone. O, take time then, and
be ruled by God: youth and health you see is a blessed time. In the Book of
Wisdom see another v^e of this time of this day, and ever remember it,
namely, That it might be known, how we ought to prevent the Sun Wisd. 16.
28.
rising, to give thanks unto God, and to salute him before the day spring. For
the hope of the unthankful shall melt as the Winter Ice, and flow away as
unprofitable waters. 29.
Let us do thus then, and be most assured that such Morning sacrifice shall be
no less profitable unto us than pleasing to him.

5. And did they just gather their measure, and no more, every man? No. The
Text says, Some gathered more, Ver. 17. 18.
and some less. Yet when they did measure it with an OMER, he that had
gathered much, had nothing over, and he that had gathered little, had no
lack, etc. By which miracle the Lord would both restrain the greedy Scrapers
of this world, that are never satisfied, and comfort his own Chosen that have
not such heaps. For what has the greatest Raker that lives amongst us at this
day touching himself, but his living? and has not the poorest man by his
little as much? yes assuredly, we see it daily. Nay we see more, namely, that
this little, little, which the poor man has, yields him often a more
healthie life, and a merrier mind, sounder sleep and quieter thoughts, than
that great abundance which the greedy Gatherer has gotten. Daniel with his
thin fare of pulse and water, looks as well or better than they that feed
upon the Kings allowance, such a mighty God every way is our God. And why then
should our desire to have, be so exorbitant? or our hearts so dejected, if we
have but little? GOD will make my little stretch to an OMER, that is, to
enough, and his much shall be no more, do what he can. O mind, mind, then
be content; Look upon thy God, and fear nothing: he is the same, he is no
Changeling, etc,

6. Did they reserve nothing of all their gatherings till the morning? your
Chapter goes on, and says, Let no man reserve thereof till the morning.
Notwithstanding Ver. 19. 20.
they obeyed not Moses, but some of them reserved of it till the morning, and
it was full of worms, and stanke: therefore Moses was very angry with them.
See ever in the world some disobedient and distrustful wretches, let all the
Preachers in the world (were they as good as Moses) say and do what they can.
They will rake, they will scrape, they will hoord and muckervp: their wicked
Mammon is their GOD, and their Chest their hope in time of need. But what
became of Manna it self, when it was kept contrary to Gods liking? Worms
bred in it, as you see; it stanke, and no ways served to their use that so
disobediently had laid it up. Even so, so shall it ever be with this Crew,
let them make their reckoning of it, and rest assured. Ill gotten goods shall
not prosper, nor the third heir be the better for them. Our eyes daily see
what may teach our hearts, if GOD be within us: and this notable place of
rotting Manna would never be forgotten.

7. Yet the sixth day they reserved, and it corrupted not. Uerie true, and let
it never go out of your mind Ver. 24.
whilst you live. For upon the sixth day they were commanded to gather both
for that day and the day following, (ver. 5.) which was the seventh day and
the Sabbath: to the end they might rest upon the Sabbath: and not go out to
gather, and it corrupted not. No more shall any goods you get and gather with
the will and good liking, and by the commandment of Almighty God, that is,
truly, lawfully, and with a good conscience, but the Lord shall bless that
basket, and that store to you whilst you live, and to yours when you are gone:
and though it be but little, yet he shall make it sufficient to sustain your
self, to bring up your Children, and to do what they which have thrice as
much as you coming in, cannot do. Your Children again after you, maintained
with that which you have well gotten, shall prosper either in learning, or
trade, so that they shall come to great Places often, and to be Great men:
to carry such Offices of credit as are in the Country or Tewne where they
dwell, and leave Gods mercies again to their Children after them, to a
thousand generations loving and fearing Gods holy Name and keeping his
Commandments; when the quite contrary shall come to pass with the goods ill
gotten, as you have seen.

8. Forget not to mark here also the great care that GOD has of his Sabbath,
that it be kept holy according to his appointment, when he will not suffer
these Israelites to gather so much as his Manna for their food upon the
Sabbath day, but appoints them to do it the day before. May not a good soul
thus reason then with himself, or her self? Good Lord, what do I upon the
Sabbath day? This people of his, might not gather Manna, and may I safely gad
to Faiers and Markettes, to dauncinges and drinkinges, to wakes and
wantonness, to Beare-baytinges, and Bull-baytinges, with such like wicked
prophanations of the Lords day? May I be absent from the Church, where Gods
people are gathered together in his Name, and he in the midst of them, walking
about my Closes and grounds, sending my Servant and Cattle to Towns with
corn which I have sold before, because I will not spare them on the week
days, and so forth? Are these works for the Sabbath? Is this to keep holy the
Sabbath day? Can I answer this to my God that gives me six days for my
self, and takes but one day to himself of which I rob him also? No, no,
assuredly I shall not be able to endure his wrath for these things one day;
and therefore I will leave them, and regard hereafter his holy Sabbath better
than I have done. Yes assuredly this is a sound and a blessed Reason: and
therefore I pray God to set it in our hearts, since now a-daies there is so
much offending this way.

9. When came this Manna from Heaven, in the day, or in the night? In the
night, when the dew fell down, this Heavenly bread fell with it, and in the
morning as has been noted (verse, 14) When the dew ascended, this lay all
scattered upon the earth to be gathered till the heat of the Sun melted it
away (ver. 21.) What a sweet Note do I see here? namely, that when his
Children sleep and are at rest, Gods providence for them sleeps not, but
works and gives things for their use, and for their comfort, for their
health, for their life, and for their advancement unto honor. Grows not the
grass when we sleep, and the best herbs for our health and use? Come not
the sweet showers when we sleep that make the Husbandman rejoice and sing?
Peter was a sleep in the prison, the next day to suffer death by cruel
tyranny, watched and warded, and bound with chains: neither was Acts. 12. 7,
8.
there any help in man's eyes for him, only the little flock of Gods Children
(gathered together in the house of a religious woman) prayed for him; but the
providence of God was not sleep, which watched over him and his life, and sent
his Angel to deliver him in such miraculous manner as you read of: ever and
ever leaving us a Testimony of his care, love, mercy, and power as shall be
good for us, the sweetness whereof I am not able to reach unto: but cry with
the Prophet from my heart, O blessed, blessed is the man that has the Lord for
his God! it is better to trust in him, than in all the Princes of the world:
And if he be on our side, we need not care what man can do against us. Such
another Example is that of king Ahasuerosh not able to sleep, but calling for
the Chronicles, and hitting upon that place where Mordecai his loyalty and
faithful service was mentioned, thereby enquiring what had been done for him,
and so exalting him to great honor. Poor Mardocheus was a sleep when this
was done: and little thought of such a matter. But his sweet and gracious God
was not on sleep you see, sending from Heaven his Manna, that is, his
comfortable Mercy to his Childs honor, and his whole Churches good by his
advancement. Shall we ever then fall from this God, by distrustful fear,
that thus cares for his when they be on sleep? Lord, Lord give us the use of
these things, and strengthen our Meditation to an immovable Faith, and strong
comfort in Thee evermore. Consider the old generations Eccles. 2. 11.
of men, says the wise Sirach, and mark them well: was there ever any
confounded that put his trust in the Lord? Did ever any continue in his fear,
and was forsaken? or ever any call upon him, and was despised? No, no; no, no.
And therefore lay it up in your heart and mark the Scriptures. If we believe
that he has made our bodies; shall we not also believe that he will provide
for Math. 6. 25. Psalm. 139. 17,
them, seeing the creation is greater than the preservation? Has he care over
the wicked to do them good, and will he not much more rejoice to do his
Children good? Did the Lord love us when we were his enemies? and will he
leave us succourlesse when we are reconciled to him in so dear a price as his
own Sons precious blood? O, if he did us good when he might have punished
us for our sins, will not he now do us good, when through his grace we hate
sin, in some measure sanctified by his holy Spirit? He will, he will, and
never fear therefore, but cleave fast. Think with your self how the Fathers
before the flood eating nothing but herbs, yet lived some seven hundred, some
eight hundred, and some nine hundred years; and know by it that man lives not
by these means, but if neither grass, nor corn, nor any usual food now
amongst us were in the earth, yet could God Preserve us and keep us both
alive, and in health, and in good liking. But much more now by flesh and fish
and his other good blessings can he do it. Moses and Elias lived forty days
Exodus 34. 8. 1. King. 19. 8. Deuteronomy. 2. 7
without meat: and the Israelites walked (as I noted) forty years in the
wilderness with the same apparel not waxen old. By which and many such
things mo in the Scriptures, you see that the blessing of God is all in all;
and that these earthly means are but things given of GOD for our use, which
yet he can want when he will; and notwithstanding preserve us. Up with your
heart then, how hard soever the world goes with you, and fix both heart and
eyes upon GOD, believe his Scriptures and read them for your comfort, all
shall be well, assure your self in his time.

10 The Lord by Moses commands a pot of this Manna to be kept in the Arc
for a remembrance ever of ver. 32 33.
this great miracle, and so it was; which very notably may teach us, ever to be
careful to keep in mind the gracious favors of our good God showed unto
us, and not to suffer them to be forgotten. The Scripture often lays this
point before our eyes, if you remember. As in Deuteronomy. Take heed to thy self,
and keep thy soul diligently, Deuteronomy. 4. 9
that thou forget not the things which thine eyes have seen, and that they
depart not out of thine heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy
sons, and thy sons sons. So in the sixth Chapter again. These words Deuteronomy.
66.
which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart. And 7.
thou shall rehearse them continually unto thy children, and shall talk of
them when thou tariest in thine house, and as thou walk by the way, and when
thou lie down, and when thou risest up. And thou shall bind them for 8.
a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
Also thou shall write them upon the 9.
posts of thine house, and upon the gates, etc. When they passed over Iorda^
on dry land presently twelve stones were set up for a remembrance. David in his
Psalm, Joshua 4. 21. Psalm. 103. 2.
Praise the Lord O my Soul, and forget not, forget not all his benefits. So
the Fathers have many good Sayings to this end. As Saint Gregory. So much
shall thy Soul find more sweet rest in Heaven, by how much thou give thy
mind less rest in this World from the continual remembrance of GOD and his
Works. If thy Corn lay in a low moiste and dankishe vault, where it might
putrify and corrupt, Would thou not speedily and carefully raise it up to
a higher and sweeter Place, that so it might continue sweet? Why then dooest
thou suffer thy Mind to lie so low among the rotten things of this World,
that also will corrupt it with a grievous corruption, and dooest not speedely
and carefully also raise it up to a sweet remembrance of GODS favors and
great works for thee, for thy Neighbors, for thy Country, for his Church
and Children in all ages? Here, here is the sweet being of the Mind, and not
below. Again, mark how the eyes of thy body (if they be in a smokie place)
are vered and grieved with that foul smoke, and shed out their tears to
be delivered there hence: So think of the light of thy mind, that with vile
things it is much offended, but with remembrance of good things much pleased
and bettered. Ever therefore let it have his comfort: and look upon that pot
of Manna which God has given thee from heaven, that is upon his mercies and
favors vouchsafed unto thee many ways in thy life time, which to thee are
the Testimonies of his love and gracious providence, as this Manna here was to
the Israelites. Another says, Will the young Lamb be drawn from his damme, or
the young kid, the young calfe, the little chickens, and such like? will not
they still keep with their kind, not stray away far, but run to the damme
again? So certainly should our minds not stray from our God, and the
thankful remembrance of his mercies: but ever keep here, and tarry here, and
joy here as in our sweet and quiet comfort. A good careful servant is still
in his Masters eye, and cannot abide to be far off. No more can the servant
of God assuredly be pleased in the forgetfulness of his God and his great
works. The fire of the Altar went not out either by night or by day: No more
should the fire within you, that is, the heat of thankful feeling and due
remembrance of Grace received from a sweet God. The Priests did bring wood to
that fire upon the Altar, and still nourish it that it might ever burn: so
will the zealous Preacher to thy inward Soul give a holy heat, continually,
and keep in that blessed fire of love, of zeal, of thankfulness and so
forth, to Almighty God, if thou diligently frequent his company and hear his
words. For the Lord has appointed him to this end, to keep this fire within
his people, and his ordinance shall not be in vain, unless the fault be
yours. What a heat will the fire give to the coldest water if it be set to it?
But remove the same water from the fire again, and it returns to his former
coldness: So, so is it in the matter we speak of, and forget it not. The
preserved fruit that is bailed in sugar loses his own tartness, and takes
a sweeter taste from the sugar, that all men may know where it has been: And
even so assuredly will a mind much meditating on Gods benefits, and (to the end
it may the better do it) much frequenting the reading and hearing of the Word,
taste most sweetly both with God and Man. Wherefore follow this advise of
Scripture and Fathers, and learn by this reserving of Manna for a remembrance,
what an acceptable thing to God, and what a fit duty for his servant this
careful remembrance of his works is.

11. Now as by this Figure of the kept Manna, men were taught to remember all
Gods mercies in general: So in particular it did lay before the Israelites the
promised seed Christ Jesus, of when it was a very notable Type, and therefore
may likewise teach us, as to remember all Gods mercies, so (by name) this great
mercy above all, the gift of his dear and blessed Son our Savior for us.
The type is resembled by learned men in this sort. First, Manna came down from
heaven, so did Christ as touching John. 6. 41. Datum, paratu^, Donum non
debitum, Beneficiu^ largientis, non praemium accipientis. Esaias. 53. 3.
his deity. Secondly, Manna signifies a gift or a thing prepared: so was
Christ given and prepared by the love of God, without all merit or cause in us.
Thirdly, Manna was but a small and contemptible thing to look on; so was
Christ little regarded of earthly minded worldlings, but as the Prophet notably
declares, much despised and set at naught. Manna was round, which is ye
perfectest figure, and so was Christ a perfect Savior to all that ever
believed in him. Manna was white, the color of innocence, and our Savior
Christ without spot or blot of any sin. Manna was sweet and like the honey, so
is Christ sweeter than any honey to all those that taste him by a true Faith.
Manna was bruised and beaten in morters and milles, Christ was tormented for our
sins with many torments. All were commanded to gather Manna, and all that
travel and are heavy laden Matthew. 11. 28.
are commanded to come and take hold of Christ. Manna continued till they
came into the land of promise Mat. 28. 20. 1. Cor. 15. 24 27. 28.
and then ceased, Christ shall be with us to the end of the world, shall subdue
all things under his feet, and then himself be subject to God, deliver up the
Kingdom to him, that God may be all in all. Thus notably you see was Christ
foreshadowed in this Manna. The Israelites might not forget the shadow, and may
we forget the substance and thing it self? No, no. And therefore well prayed
the old Father, Da Domne vt sicut verbum caro factum est, sic cor meum fiet
carneum. Lord grant that as the word became flesh, so my heart may be also
fleshy, and not stony, Majesty humbled it self, and shall misery exalt it
self? Remember often and remember ever this sweet Manna. Puer natus, Filius
datus, A Child is borne, a Son is given. Datus ex diuinitate, natus Esaias. 9. 6.
ex virgin. Natus, qui sentiret occasum. Datus qui nesciret exordium. Natus,
qui matre junior. Datus, quo non pater senior. Natus, qui m^oeretur: Datus, ex
quo vitanasceretur. Sic qui erat, Datus; qui non erat, Natus, Given in regard
of his Deity* Borne in regard of his humanity. Borne, who should have an
end. Given who had no beginning. Borne, who was younger than his mother. Given,
who was as old as his Father. Borne, who should die. Given, from whom life
should spring. So he that was, was Given, and he that was not, was Borne.
Ambulare vis? ego sum via: falli Ioh. 14. 6.
non vis? ego sum veritas: mori non vis? ego sum vita. Noc dicit tibi
Saluatortuus, non est quo eas, nisi ad me; non est qua eas, nisi per me. Surge
homo, via venit ad ^e. Will thou walk? I am the way: wilt not thou be
deceived? I am the truth; will thou not die? I am the life. This says thy
Savior to thee. There is none to go unto but to me, there is none by whom
thou may go, but by me. Arise O man, the way comes unto thee. Thus
remember (I say) again this blessed Manna, and let this much suffice of this
Chapter.

CHAP. 17.
The general Heads of this Chapter are two. A bitter contention for want of
water. A war with Amalech.


1. COncerning the first, thus we may profit, in ye wilderness of Sin they
ver. 1.
complain of famine and wish for the fleshpottes of Egypt again, and for
their bellies full of bread. Thence they remove and come to Rephidim, where
they as bitterly complain for want of water. So to an earthly mind that will
not look at God, every place ministers some coffeehouse; when a heart
grounded in piety, takes all well that God sends: and learneth as well to
want as to abound. Again even to the godly, Philip. 4. 12.
such as many of these Israelites were (for we may not understand that all were
guilty of these murmurings, but a great sort, or the greater sort) one cross
succeeds another, that still our life may be a true warrefare and no heaven
made of earth. A man that is borne of a woman, (says holy Job) has but a
short time to live, and is full of trouble, Job. 14. 1.
full of trouble I say again, and we must mark it. So shall we grow to the
Apostles resolution, desiring to be loosed and Philip. 1. 23.
to be with Christ which is best of all. For never shall we have permanent
comfort till that day come, but still a mixture and an unequal mixture; more
of the sour than of the sweet, more of the woe than of ye weal, that we may
cry heartily, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly. Revel. 22. 20.


2 When they are pinched with this want of water what do they? Not cry unto
God, but fly upon Moses with an unfitting speech saying, Give us water that
we Ver. 2.
may drink; as though Moses were God to create fountains and springs. Thus
does corrupt man possessed with impatiencie take a wrong course, leave God and
run to Man, and then speak according to his rage, without due and right
consideration of Man's ability and power. A like speech had good Rachel to her
husband Jacob, when impatiencie had caught her, Give me children. To whom Jacob
Genesis 30. 1.
answered not without grief, AM I GOD etc? Let us therefore, in all our wants,
set our faces the right way, and look to Heaven, not to Earth; to God, not to
Man. For there is the tresurie and the bottomless storehouse of all comforts.
Ask there, seek there, knock there, and you have a promise. Run to
creatures and you Mat. 7. 7.
have none. Again Moses was the Magistrate set over them by God, and therefore
an high offense to contend with him, to be troublesome to him, and to grieve
him. Such malcontents are odious to God, and their ends, if they continue in
their faults, ever foul. Moses was further a meek Governor and most mild,
the Scripture says of him, that he was the meekest man alive: He had Numb. 12.
3.
delivered them from a bloody bondage, and been Gods instrument of many
benefits and comforts. The more therefore was their fault a great deal, ye
better and sweeter his government was to them. Let it teach as many as have the
like blessing to avoid the like sin, and to be thankful both to God, and his
means. It is registered for a praise ever to endure, and the remembrance of it
God will not have put out, that when a rebellious spirit made a commotio^
against David ye 2. Sam. 20. 1. etc.
Lords anointed, and the men of Israel foolishly and wickedly followed him,
and forsook their King, yet the men of Judah would not do it, but as the Text
says, They claue fast unto their King: to their good King, their religious
King, their natural Prince, their loving Lord and Governor anointed and set
over them by a mighty God. No Charms would they hearken unto against him, but
claue fast unto him, and I say again, the praise of it shall never dye.

3 They are said also to tempt the Lord; A further degree of sin in them.
Which all men do, when they doubt of his power, his will, and his truth, when
they take upon them to prescribe ways and means how they will be helped: and
do not patiently expect his comfort by such ways and means, and in such time
as to him shall seem good. That thus they tempted him the 7. ver. shows,
Ver. 7.
where they say, Is the Lord among us? making that a Question which was so
manifest, unless they might have what they would, and when they would, and as
they would. Had ever people greater Testimonies of Gods presence among them
than they? Did not they even at this time receive every morning a toke^ of it,
when they gathered Manna? O impatiece then! whither will thou carry our corrupt
nature, if God stay thee not? far otherwise did that Saint of God David, when
in as great a distress as this he said, 2. Sam. 15. 25.
Carry the Ark of God again into the City: if I shall find favor in the eyes
of God, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and the Tabernacle
thereof. But if he 26.
thus say, I have no delight in thee, hehold here am I, let him do to me as
seems good in his eyes. Here is patience and contentment in Gods holy will
whatsoever it is, be it to weal, or be it to Woe, be it to Life, or be it
to, Death. And what Man or Woman ever lost by carrying themselves thus toward
their GOD? David found a blessing of this course, and returned in safety to
his house. The Rebels against him being confounded and scatered in GODS
powerful justice. Pray it therefore with your heart as you do with tongue,
and pray it often both with Heart and Tongue, Thy will be done, Thy will be
done, O my Father, with me ever. In it will I rest, in it will I joy by thy
helping grace, and be always assured of thy true Word. All things even all
things work for the best to them that love thee. I could note by these
mutinies and stirs, the difficulty of government, the nature of the
multitude, the lot of Gods Ministers and such like, but before they have been
touched upon diverse the like occasions; nothing must discourage a man in that
calling that God has placed him in. Vae tibi si praes, and non prodes, sed vae
grauius, si quiapraeesse metuis, prodesse refugis. Woe be to thee, if thou
govern and do not profit, but more woe be unto thee, if because thou art
afraid to govern, thou refuse to profit, says S. Bernard.

4. Then Moses cried unto the Lord saying, what shall I do to this people? for
they be almost ready to stone ver. 4.
me. The true refuge of Magistrate, Minister, and all godly, is ever to fly
unto the Lord by hearty and earnest prayer, as here you see Moses does. Thus
again, when Pharaoh pursued to the red Sea: and in bath places his prayer
Exodus 14. 15.
is called a crying for the earnestnes of it in his heart, although he spoke
never a word with his mouth. So says David in his Psalm, Thus and thus they
abused me, but I gave my self to prayer. It is a blessed course and never
Psalm. 109. 4.
fails them that use it. But stand you not amazed at the other part of the
verse? namely, that they were ready almost to stone Moses, such a man, such a
Magistrate, so dear to God, so profitable to them, so famous in all Egypt, and
almost over the world, for those great works wherewith it had pleased God to
grace him? O turba quam semper es turbulenta? O world world, what trust is to
be reposed in thee? this is the constancy of thy favor ever. The Multitude is
thus to be reckoned of, be a man's deserts never so good, and yet how hunt many
after this breath? how spend they? how spoil they themselves and all theirs
to be great with the people, and to be spoken of by the multitude, never
thinking in due time of the nature of this greatness, and what all monuments of
learning have said of it? Do not the Scriptures show us, how reverently the
Pharisees sent unto John, and yet after affirmed him to Math. 11. 18.
have the Devil? Whereupon, our Savior Christ utters a Sentence worthy to
be written in a wise man's heart for ever, John was a burning and shining
candle; John. 5. 35.
and ye would for a season have rejoiced in his light. Mark these words (for
a season) and settle them soundly in your heart, that they may ever show you,
that were you as great as John Baptist, who had not a greater amongst Math. 11.
11.
them that were begotten of women, yet your credit is but for a season with
worldly men, and with the common multitude. To day a man, to morrow a beast,
to day none better, to morrow none worse, to day a God, to morrow a Devil.
The Lord Jesus himself found this measure, and all his Disciples and Servants
after him. Absalon would write kindly to Ioab to day, 2. Sam. 14.
and tomorrowe set his corn on fire. The world weighs without Balance,
numbreth without Counters, and measures without Rule. The Balance, Counters,
and Rule of the world, is a fickle fading, hot and hasty humor for a time.
How close and fast will the Quickefiluer cleave unto the gold? you would
think it could never be gotten away, yet as soon as the fire comes, it is
gone and no sign to be seen of it. Even so is the liking of the world not
loving in GOD and for GOD. They that run at Tilt, look to the Judges what
they say, and not what the vulgar people say. So must a wise man ever look,
what his Judge in Heaven allows, and not what inconstant men on earth praise.

If anie-man would warn you of the fall of the house wherein you are, you
would soon be gone, and shall no warning serve to make you avoid the
tottering applause of the world? Glorious Haman how soon is he down, and
his glory gone as if it had never been: Great Holophernes that was so
fearful with his power, falls and vanishes in a moment. Mighty Antiochus
the King of Syria what a change found he in an instant? He that hangs upon
the worlds opinion shall to day be great to morrow little, and the third day no
body. In one day, and almost in one hour, Ioram the King of Israel, Ochozias
the King of Judah, and wicked Iezabel, all secure in peace and worldly comfort,
are slain by Iehu, and their pomp gone. That potent Monarch Alexander after
such glory and fame dies in his flower, and lies 30 days unburied, his
friends being busy in sharing his Kingdoms. Valerian the Emperor taken of
the Persian King, is made a footestoole for him to tread upon in going to his
horse. Such Stories many our Books have: but these suffice for a taste. If God
and man have found the worlds love fickle, shall you only find it fast?
believe it not; But remember worthy Moses here, ready to be stoned, by those
that even now when the Sea was divided, honored him greatly. You can never
give any people so many causes to stick unto you, as he did give this people
to cleave unto him, and yet they failed. Write it therefore in your hands, and
in your heart for ever, and in well doing depend upon God, you shall find him
never to fail you. Mark also your Marginall Note here in your Bible.

5. What answers the Lord, to this inward cry of his grieved and troubled
servant Moses? See I pray you in the two verses following, the 5. and the 6. He
bids Ver. 5. 6.
him take his rod, and strike a hard stony rock: and it should yield the
people water to drink, and for their cattle also at full. A mighty powerful
work of God, and full of good instructions for all those that will observe
them. As first, that against such a rebellious people so froward, so stubborn,
and so forgetful of his former favors, yet he thundreth not out wrath and
judgments as they deserved, but mildly and mercifully still deals with them,
adding mercy to mercy, favor to favor, and goodness to goodness, for all
their evil. So teaching all Governors patience and long suffering, not to
follow with rigor and extremity all wrongs, not setting power against folly,
and yielding measure for measure in full recompense of ill deserts, but
according to the Course of God here doing good for evil, even to men of
bitte^r tongues and naughty hearts against us, to men forgetful of the good
we have done them, and every way deserving evil of us. I know, I know, this
is soon said, but not so soon done. For flesh and blood cannot away with this
course. There is a law in our members that rebelleth against this Counsel.
But what then? here is my God before me, the best pattern that can be
followed: who has power to punish, and yet spares, who has power to hurt,
and yet helps, who has power to kill with the breath of his mouth ten
thousand worlds, and yet saves all, and slays not the meanest man of all
this company that murmured against him. And his power in me can work that,
which otherwise my corruption will not abide to yield unto. That spirit
therefore so powerful, I will pray for to make me able to follow this example
of my Almighty Father, and I will set this Precede^t before mine eyes to direct
me and teach me, as any way I shall be able to learn. His blessed servant the
Apostle S. Paul treads in the same steps when he says, Dearly beloved,
avenge not your selves, but give Romans 12. 19.
place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine: I will repay. Recompense
to no man evil for evil: but overcome 17. and 21.
evil with goodness, etc.

Secondly, it yields a most strong comfort unto us in all our wants. For can
we ever think that this GOD which regards the need of such Rebels and gives
them help even miraculously, will despise our wants and suffer us in them to
perish without relief? Search (I say) your own Soul, and tell me if you can
harbor such a thought against so sweet a God? If you cannot, but abhor to
do it, then see how you are assured by this Place, of his blessed providence
for you and yours, yea even for your very Cattle if they want but water. And
clap both your hands upon it, bind it to your heart, and let it never depart
from you whilst life endures in this world of wants. What moved him to this
mercy you see, not their merits but his own promise only and goodness. Reason
then ever with your weak heart, true to them and not true to me? O fie, fie,
avoid vile thought, my God is ever true in all his promises, and to all his
Children, never failing any that relieth upon him. I will tarry therefore the
Lords leisure, and submit my self to his good will: for he that helped such
Repiners as these, will in his good time look upon my want. The eyes of my
poor Children shall wait upon him for bread and drink: and he shall fill
them with his blessing when and how he thinks fit.

Thirdly, it is a profitable observation here, to see how no evil in man can
drive GOD from his promise; and yet Satan will suggest still, O, thou art not
worthy of mercy, thou art sinful and a great great sinner, thou must be
punished in Gods justice, he cannot spare thee, therefore trouble him not,
hope not in him, for there is no mercy for such a one, etc. Why vile Satan,
is my comfort reposed in mine own worth? or do I rest upon mine own merit? I
tell thee I confess all thou say of mine own unworthiness, and therefore
have no hope that way, but I look at his promise, and I consider his truth,
and I see here and every where that no evil in man can make him evil by
breaking his promise, therefore I may not despair. I have his promise, that
he will forgive a grieved sinner at all times, for all sins were they as red
as blood: and that he will never cast any away that comes unto him. I
believe him and I will be comforted John. 6. 37.
in his never failing truth: auaunt thou vile Tempter from me. Though the Lord
should kill me, yet will I put my trust in him. In which holy dispute with
your Job. 13. 15.
self, remember I pray you, the old Fathers how they have gone before you in
this point, Tota spes mea est in morte Domini mei, mors eius meritum meum.
Refugium meum, salus mea, vita mea, resurrectio mea, meritum meum miseratio
Domini. Non sum inops meriti, quamdiu ille non est inops miserationis. Et si
misericordiae Domini multae, multus ego sum in meritis. Quanto ille potentior
ad saluandum, tanto sum ego securior. Peccaui peccatum grande, and multorum sum
conscius mihi delictorum, non tamen despero; quia vbi abundauit delictum ibi
superabundauit gratia, etc. All my hope is on the death of my Lord, his death
is my merit. My refuge, my health, my life, my resurrection, My merit is the
Lords mercy. And I am not void of merit so long as he is not void of
mercy. If his mercies be many my merits be also many. And the stronger he
is to save, the more secure and safe am I. My sin is great that I have
committed, yea I am guilty of many sins, yet despair I not; for where sin
abounds Grace has super-abounded. He that despaireth of the forgiveness of
his sins, denies GOD to be merciful, yea he denies as much as lies in
him that GOD has love, truth and power, in which three all my comfort
consists, to wit, in the love of his adoption, in the truth of his promise,
and in his power to perform. Let my foolish Cogitation then mutter what it
lists within me, saying, who art thou? or by what merit or worthiness do
thou hope to obtain such great glory? I comfortablie will answer I know
whom I have believed, and I am sure that in love he has adopted me to be
his Child, that he is true in his promise, and powerful in performance. And
these three so strengthen my heart, that no want of merit, no consideration of
my own vileness, no greatness of the future blessedness can cast me
down from the height of hope, wherein I am soundly rooted. This is the
three-folde cord, etc. To this effect have many other Fathers written also,
but I omit them.

Lastly, this example of God in this place, as it teaches patience and long
suffering when we are abused, so does it notably also teach constancy in love
where we once have loved. A thing worthy following, if I had not been too
long in this Note. I will therefore reserve it to some other place, only now
praying you to remember whom you resemble, if this grace be in you, and from
whom you swerue if it be not. It is enough to move a Child of God.

6. Of this striking of the Rock there is often mention made in the
Scriptures; and therefore a thing worthy good consideration. He claue the
hard rocks in the Wilderness; Psalm. 78. 15.
and gave them drink thereof, as if it had been out of the great depthes. He
brought waters out of the stony rock, 16.
so that it gushed out like the rivers. Again in another Psalm, He opened the
rock of stone, and the waters flowed Psalm. 105. 41.
out, so that rivers ran in dry places. For why? he remembers his holy
promise and Abraham his servant. 42.
The things we may think of are these, The fall of Moses and Aaron at this
time, The figure and allegory of this rock. Concerning the first read what
is written in the Book of Numbers. Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation
Numb. 20. 10.
together before the rock; and Moses said unto the^, Hear now, ye Rebels:
shall we bring you water out of this rock? And the Lord said to Moses and
Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the presence 12.
of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation
into the Land which I have given them. Here you see it revealed that Moses and
Aaron staggered at this matter, and offended the Lord. Whereby we are notably
taught, that although there be many in this world who through the grace that is
given them, fight a good fight, having faith and a good Conscience: yet there
is not one free from all sin, saving Jesus Christ alone. But even Moses
himself here that Great light, has his darkness and his infirmity. He that
had wrought such Great miracles, and divided the maine Sea through the power of
him that now bids him strike the rock: yet here he doubts and faints
in Faith, as God himself witnesses of him. Truly therefore said the Prophet
David, If the Lord shall mark what is done amisle, Who, Who shall be able to
abide it? And the Apostle likewise, There Romans 3. 10.
is none that is righteous, no not one. All have gone out of the way: And in
the sight of God can no flesh living be 12.
justified. Let not Sachan then amaze us with our imperfections: for the
sweetest Roses have their prickels; and Christ came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance. On the other side again, Let not Satan tempt us to
a conceit of purity or perfection either in our selves, or others: for if
Moses fall, if David fall, if Samuel fall, if Job fall, if Abraham fall, and
all have fallen, who shall say, my heart is clean? Beware of these extremities
both ways, and walking in the middle way, take hold of Christ, by him fearing
no imperfection, and for him flying all vain thoughts of absolute integritte.
Again, learn here and forget it never, what an odious thing in the sight of
God any doubting in him is, which yet the Doctrine of Rome so labors to
maintain. For when for this only fault the Lord is so moved with his dear
servant Moses, that he reiectech him from conducting his people into the
promised Land, and burieth him in the Desert: certainly we may not entertain
doubting in our hearts, touching any promise of his, and especially in so great
a matter, or in such a graund Article of Faith as the Remission of sins is.

7. For the second thing, namely the Type: you read in the Apostle, that this
rock was Christ, that is, a Figure of Christ. With which kind of phrase would
the Romish Teachers not wrangle, that Great contention about the Sacrament
needed uot. For to give the name of the thing signified to the sign signifying
was never strange among learned men, and in this very particular of the
Sacrament, S. Augustines words are well known, Non dubitabat Dominus dieere
hoc est corpus meu^, cum signum daret corporis sui: The Lord doubted not to
say, This is my body when he gave a sign of his body: To which end also
speak other of the Fathers abundantly, if it were any purpose here to enter
into his matter.

8 For the third thing, namely the Allegory, thus is it noted by the learned.
That when all mankind was to be smitten by the Law for sin; yet through the
infinite love of God the Rock only was smitten, that is, Christ of whom ye
Law laid hold for us, and he submitting himself for us, was smitten off it
for us. Thus says the Prophet, He was smitten for our transgressions, and with
his stripes we Esaias. 53. 5.
are healed. Other Scriptures also, That God so loved the John 3. 16.
world, that he gave his only be gotten Son to suffer. etc. That he himself
bare our sins in his body on the 1. Pet. 2. 24.
tree, etc. This blessed rock thus smitten for us has gushed out sweet water
for us to drink, and to cool that scalding heat of burning sin in our
souls, which else would quickly kill us and be our bane. Whosoever drinks of
the water that I shall give him says this our Rock and John. 4. 14.
Savior, shall never be more a thirst, but the water that I shall give, shall
be in him a well of water, springing up to everlasting life. But let no man
think that this water that is, the sweet and cheering comfort of the Gospel,
is to be got by man's merits (as some teach) but ever remember the Prophets
words, Ho, every one that thirsts come ye to the waters, and ye that have no
silver, come Esaias. 55 1.
buy and eat; come, I say, buy wine and milk without silver and without
money. etc. The Prophets words are sull of force. First, calling to All to
come, and excepting none, which is a great comfort: and the^ offering mercy
without money, that all cursed cogitations of works and worthes in our selves,
might ever die and be abhorred. Come unto me all ye that travel and are heavy
laden, and I will refresh you, not your own merits and works. The blood of
Jesus Christ cleanses us, says the Apostle, from al sin; al sin I say again,
and not our works from any. He, he is the propitiation for our sins, and
nothing else wholly or partly. Therefore let us do no wrong to this blessed
Rock, but being thankful to God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, let us look
to be saved only by that means that so graciously is provided, and drink
we ever and only of this water.

The 2. part.
THen came Amalech and fought with Israel in Rephidim. Ver. 8.
I still like to put you in remembrance, that as God has given us bodies, so
has he given us souls; and as meat for the body, so for the soul, even his
holy and blessed Word. If the body feed not, it cannot live; and if the soul
feed not, it must likewise die. If the body eat, and yet feel no taste of
sweetness and comfort in the meat, or digest it not well in the stomach and
convert it to good nutriment for the parts, we say and think the body is
sick, and verelie so is it with the soul. Wherefore ever think with your
self, when you have red, or heard read unto you a piece of Scripture, what you
are the better for it, what taste, what relish, what use and profit you have by
it. And if you find any, thank your God, and be much comforted with it, for it
is an assured taken that your soul is in health. But if you find none, call
for the Physician, even the Physician of your soul, and pray him to help you.
God shall be pleased with your care, and give a blessing. But if he be absent,
and not at hand, til he come take this my labor, and as far as it goes
make use of it. It may please God to make it profitable, at least it shall show
you how I my self profited both in that which is past, and now again in this
second part.

1 First then I see here a war, and it is the First war that these
Israelites had after their deliverance out of Egypt. I think with my self
(meditating of it) why God should suffer his chose^ people delivered by him
with such a mighty arm from Pharaoh, and directed altogether in their journey
by him (for they traveled not but when and which way he by the cloud in the
day, and the pillar of fire in the night directed them) I say, I think with my
self, why God should suffer his people to be troubled in their way, and set
upon and fought withal? And I conceive these uses. First, that he might fit
them for great conflicts which they must have in the execution of his justice
upon the Chananites, whose places he had appointed unto them, determined to
root out and destroy all those inhabitants. Now, every thing has a beginning
and a training up even as schellers in the school and Tradesmen in their
trades. The young beginner is brought from easier things to harder, and at the
last made a Master of his Art: So does the Lord fit men by degrees for that
which he has appointed them unto. If he will in time have us to do any great
things, we must begin to do the less: and if we be appointed to bear great
crosses, we must begin to bear little ones: and so on on in our appointed
warrefare of this life. The good consideration whereof will make you ever
welcome what GOD sends and think it is a Degree of his school. You know not
yet what you are appointed for, but follow him, and be theerefull, the end, I
warrant you, shall be good. Secondly, by this (as by many other Scriptures) he
teaches his people the lawfulness of wars both defensive and offensive
contrary to fantastical spirits that talk they know not what. The Magistrate
bears not Romans 13. 4.
the sword in vain, but has it to defend, and offend, as occasion serves,
that is, to protect the good and to smite the evil, Thirdly, to tell us and
his Church ever, that as these Israelites could not travel to the earthly
Canaan but they must fight with Amalech in the way; no more can we travel to
the heavenly Canaan without battle given to many foes. The Devil, the World,
and the flesh they are fierce Amalechites: and they must be fought with, yea
they must be overcome also as Amalech was of Israel, or else we shall never see
Canaan. Poverty, Sickness, Crosses by children, by feigned friends, and
spiteful foes Sclanders and ill reports with infinite more they are
Amalechites, and they meet you in your way as you are traveling toward the
spiritual Canaan, they stop you, at the least they offer to stay you, so that
without buckling with them you shall not pass. At them then in the power of
our GOD and faint not, be valiant and of a stout courage, He stands at your
back that is Almighty, and he ioyeth to see you hearty. To Hell a man may
sail with a forewinde and meet never an Amalechite, but not to Heaven. When
Israel was going to Egypt they met no foes: but when they came from Egypt to
go to Canaan they meet with many. Lazarus, poor Lazarus had a bitter
battle in his way to Heaven: when the Rich-Glutton sailed smoothely to Hell,
with never a rub in his way, etc. This meditation you may follow further if you
will, and be much comforted in it in your crosses: For they are but
Amalechites, and you shall over come them arriving joyfully in the glorious
Chanaan prepared for you and all that fight manfully.

2 I consider next what should be the cause why these Amalechites would fight
with the Israelites. For as touching blood, Amalech came of Eliphaz Son of Esau
Genesis 36. 12. Genesis 32. 28. Genesis 35. 10.
by Timna his Concubine, and Esau and Jacob were brethren, so they were too
near to fight one with an other if all had been well; Neither is there
mention made of any injury done of the Israelites to Amalech. Nothing then can
I find to be the cause but that which is too common a cause still still in
the World, even a bitter envy at GODS mercies vouchsafed unto them, and a
wicked desire to have the spoil of them. GOD was gracious unto the Israelites,
and had long been, they could not abide it; and GOD meant to be further
gracious, they would prevent it. In a word, God may not do with his own what
he lists, but if his eye be good, theirs is evil; though themselves had
favors beyond their worth, yet spite they that others are favored also. An
old canker in man's heart; for Abel tasted of it so long ago at his own
brothers hand: and I would it blemished not in our days those that should be
brethren. Perhaps also there was in them naturally a root of quarreling,
iarring, and contending with others, for such roots there are too deep set in
some hearts. Men that cannot be quiet, that cannot live in peace with their
neighbors, but that delight in trouble and controversies, in strife and
debate: and will damnably boast that they have health and grow fat by going to
law with their brethren, whereas if they were quiet, they should dye. Men I
say of this nature, very limbs of Satan, the world has ever had, and still
has too many. Now these causes were all naught, and therefore this war ill
grounded, ill prospered For envy I have often touched it, but if the Lord also
touch not such hearts, nothing will serve. I say no more now, but wish they
would earnestly think of the Saying of GODS SPIRIT in the Psalm. The ungodly
shall see it, and gnash his teeth. The ungodly, Psalm. 112. 10.
the ungodly be these gnashers; And Let him that has ears to hear, hear.
For that filthy desire of having from others still, still, that their heap may
grow infinite, I wisse that Heathen Africanus well remembered, who when he should
have joined with the Priest in praying for more and more increase to the
Romans, answered no no, our state is good all ready and abundantly rich, I
will therefore rather pray that God will keep it and maintain it as it is.
Surely this man shall rise-vp in Judgment against such insatiable minds and
be a swift witness against them. The Old Saying is wise, enough is enough;
and, enough is as good as a feast. Mediocria firma, Mean things be firm, when
great things be fickle. In Plutarch is mentioned a reason why the Kings of
Sparta reigned so long: namely, because they were content with their own limit
and desired no more. The third vice is as bad as either of these, namely, To
be unquiet. And al Books of learning by occasion speak of the blot it made in
that worthy Alexander, when the Scithian Ambassadors truly told him, That if
there were no men to fight and quarrel with all, he would fight with the
woods, and the mountains, and the wild beasts. Such an other was Alcibiades,
an excellent man many ways, but so unquiet, that the Saying grew, how Graece
was not able to bear two Alcibiades. Beware then of these causes of war, and
contention: and learn by the Rod of GOD upon Amalech, to live in peace, and to
let Gods children pass by us without trouble. I could here with just honor
remember Her late Majesty's most happy government. Her blessed contentment
with her own, not seeking nor desiring the right of others, no not taking that
which was earnestly offered unto Her. In regard whereof she renownedly
flourished when other envious, greedy, and troublesome natures fell. But I end
this Note here.

3 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, Ver. 9.
and go and fight with Amalech; we may observe in this the antiquity of
Musters, and a warrant for them. All did not go here, but some, and those
chosen out by a Muster and view taken by Joshua. Such use remains still
amongst us, and in all governments else: for it is fit, it is necessary, and I
would have all Men consider well how full of honor and credit it ever was in
these cases to be chosen: as contrariewise what a blotte it carried often with
it to be omitted: as that either he was guilty of some foul vice or not
trusted etc. Then would not men run away and hide themselves as soon as they
hear of a Muster toward, as now a days they do. Such base minds and
cowardly spirits were not wont to be in Englishmen: I would it were amended;
for no friend can hear such a one but with blushing and shame. And again, it
works an other great mischief, namely, to have our armies that stand for
God and Religion, for Prince and Country to consist of such a scumme, as no
blessing can be expected where such instruments are used. Non recepiebantur
olim mili^es aliquo publico iudicio damnati, non relegatus ad tempus, multo
minus deportatus in insulam, ad bestias damnatus, immo nec reus tantum criminis
etc. Ex quorum foece tame^ nostri exercitus sunt refertissimi. In times past
(says One) They were not taken for Soldiers which were condemned by any
public judgment, or banished (for a time, or finally) or to be cast to the
beasts, or guilty of any crime; with which froath yet al our armies are full.
Obseruauit illud antiqua disciplina militaris, vt armapro iustitia et
repulsione immicorum hominibus non vitiosis darentur etc. Old Military
Discipline observed this carefully, that arms for justice and repulsing of
enemies, should not be given to vicious persons, etc. In Rome when the Empire
flourished, he thought himself not a man, that had not served in the wars
per decennium, by the space of ten years. And with us he thinks himself a
Kill-Kowe, that never saw hostem aut castra, either enemy or camp: that can
better skill to swagger and swear in an Alehouse, or in a market-towne, with
long shagged hair like a bird of Newgate, than how to serve among men like a
man. A foul degenerating from the virtue of our Elders and of our Nation. Let
it be vile hereafter to such as taste of Manhood, or have true ENGLISH blood
in their hearts.

4 To morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of GOD in my
hand, namely, to pray: for so it appears he did. Where see and Note a
religious ioining of godly Prayer with the means of outward force. This is
no new thing, but as old as Moses: acceptable to GOD, and very powerful
ever. Asa did thus, and he was a godly king. There came out against 2. Cron.
14 9.
him the king of Ethiopia or Egypt, with an host of Ten hundredth Thousand, and
three hundredth Charets, (a huge company.) And Asa went out before him, and
used 10.
both these ways. First, they set the battle in arraie, withal those
things, then join they prayer also as most requisite. And Asa cried unto the
Lord his God, and said, 11.
Lord, it is nothing with thee to help with many, or with no power: help us,
O Lord our God: for we rest on thee, and in thy Name are we come out against
this multitude: O LORD, thou art our God, let not man prevail against thee.
Then the Lord smote the Ethiopians 12.
before Asa, and before Judah and the Ethiopians fled etc. Ichoshaphat did thus
and prospered, his notable 2. Chron. 20. 3. 6. etc.
Prayer is also expressed. Mauritius did thus against the Persians and
prospered. Our Chronicles tell us of Oswald the King of Northumberland how he
did the like and prospered against Cedwall. How Ethelred being at prayer, and
hearing that his brother Alured was shrewdly distressed in the battle, yet
went on with his prayer and would not stir till he had ended that duty,
after he went and had a notable victory, and relieved his brother. The men of
S. Edmondsburie prayed against that cruel Tyrant Swanus, and the Lord heard
them, smote Swanus that he died roaring and yelling, and they were delivered.
Edward 3. against the French did thus, and prospered. Many more might be
recited. Wherefore good is that Saying of S. Ambrose to Gratian, Nosti fide
magis Imperatoris, quam virtute militum victoriam queri solere, Thou know
that victory is gotten rather by the faith of the Emperor, than by the valor
of the Soldiers. Both together fight strongly against all foes and forces as
you see. And in this place I pray you well note what follows.

5. And when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed: ver. 11.
but when he let his hands go down Amalech prevailed. Thus showed the Lord
to all posterity and succeeding ages, the force of holy prayer in battle or
elsewhere. Surely, surely, it is ever with the Lord a prevailing power as
shall be good for the parties using it. Is any sick amongst Iam. 5. 14.
you? (says S. James) let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them
pray for him. etc. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
shall raise him up: 15.
and if he has committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. For the prayer of
a righteous man avails much if it be 16.
fervent. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain, and it rayned 17.
not on the earth for three years, and six months. And he prayed again, and
the Heavens gave rain, and the earth 18.
brought forth her fruit. Agreeable heereunto is that great commendation of
prayer in Sirach, He hears the prayer of the oppressed. He despises not the
desire of the fatherless, Sirach. 35. 13. 14.
nor the widow when she pours out her prayer. Do not the tears run
down the widows cheeks? 15.
and her cry is against him that causes them: for from her cheeks they go up
to Heaven, and the Lord which hears them, does accept them. He that serves
the Lord shall be accepted with favor, and his prayer shall reach unto the 16.
clouds. The prayer of him that humbles himself goes 17.
through the clouds, and cease not till it come near, and will not depart
till the most High have respect thereunto to judge righteouslie, and execute
judgment. etc. As David's Harp wrought when the evil spirit vexed Saul (says
a learned man) so shall thy hearty and zealous prayer quiet thy troubled mind
in all distresses, and comfort thy heart in all assaulting fears. Will thou be
raised up? (says Another,) then first cast thy self down in fervent and
humble prayer? For no man is raised that first is not down. Joshua by prayer
obtained to have the Sun Joshua. 10. 12. 13.
stand still, that he might have day enough to slay the enemies of the Lord.
In the host of M. Aurelius a company of Christian Soldiers by prayer obtained

obtained thunderbolts to be thrown from Heaven in the faces of their foes,
and thereon had a name given Legio fulminea.
them of the same. Oration oranti subsidium, Deo sacrificium, Diabolo flagellum.
Prayer therefore to him that prays is a help, to God a sacrifice, and to the
Devil a whippe. But see our corruption. If we receive not what we pray for
at the first asking, we faint and cease our praying Dum extendebat manus
Moses, praese ferebat typum eius qui crucifixus est pro nobis. Quemadmodum enim

straight: not remembering how often we use a medicine for the body before we
can be whole, how many strokes an Oak must have before it will fall, and how
we over and over, again and again, plough our land and delue our Gardens, to
reap and gather fruit from them. Let us then amend this fault in our prayer
hereafter: and never forget the force of true and godly prayer in time.
Whilst Moses held up his hands (that is, continued praying) so long Joshua and
the Israelites, who^ he prayed for, prevailed. But when he gave over, the
enemy prevailed. Thus shall it be in your case, and in my case, and all others
that be troubled.

6. But Moses hands were heavy: therefore they took astone and put under him,
and he sat upon it: And Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one
side, and the other on the other side, so his hands were steadie unto the
going down of the Sun. And Joshua discomfited ver. 13. The spirit is

Amalech with the edge of the sword. This heaviness of Moses hands may teach
us the weakness of all flesh in Christian exercises. We cannot hold out and
continue as we ought, but heaviness and dullness will steal upon us, and seek
to cool us and hinder us. The help that Aaron and Hur performed unto him may
teach us the benefit of Christian company in such holy exercises, and the
needful duty of praying for him that prays for Ministri ^ij sese mutuo

us, that God would be with his spirit, that is, strengthen him and quicken him
and aid him, so to pray and so to continue his prayers, as the end may be to
his glory and our comfort. In regard whereofour Book of Common prayer has
that answer: And with thy spirit. The outward gesture may here also be noted,
which you shall find in the Scriptures to be diverse. Solomon kneeled, Ezekias
turned to the wall, Christ fell prone upon his face, the Publican 1. Kings. 8.

knocked upon his breast, and here Moses lifts up his hands. All which
gestures please God as long as they arise from zeal and truth within, and are
not hypocritical. And what the Custom of the Church wherein we live
establishes and uses, wise and peaceable persons will keep and follow.

7. Lastly, the Lord commands them to write this for a remembrance in a
Book. And Moses built an Altar, ver. 14. ver. 15.
etc. All this has use to tell us how careful we must be in keeping a
Register in our hearts of Gods mercies and favors toward us in our selves, in
our friends, in our Country, in our Magistrates, and Ministers, or any way.
The point has been touched heretofore, when we spoke of Manna: and therefore
I pass it over now: but I pray you remember Examples in this case and follow
them, Deborah, Judith, Hester, Anna, Mary, Toby, the one cleansed Leaper that
returned to give thanks, the Israelites when they passed over the Red Sea, etc,
for all these built Altars in their hearts for Gods favors, by being truly and
fervently thankful. The earth renders the Husbandman her fruit for his
pains bestowed on her; so does the Horse and Ox their labor for the meat
which they have given them. How much more should man remember what he
receaueth, and be thankful to his good God? But I stay here. These things
may yield you a taste of the use of this Chapter if you will now read over the
Text again and observe the particulars: for what is my desire, but to work a
liking of reading the Text, by showing some fruit which we may receive when we
are destitute of better teaching?

CHAP. 18.
In this Chapter we have two general Heads. The coming of Iethro to his son
in law Moses. And the appointing of more Judges to hear causes.


1. COncerning the first, the Text says, When Iethro the Priest of Midian,
Moses Father in law heard all that ver. 1.
God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and how the Lord had
brought Israel out of Egypt, Then he took Zipporah ver. 2.
Moses wife, etc, and went unto him. Thereby noting that the hearing of Gods
great and wonderful works done for his people moved his heart to come and
join himself to them, so enters God to the heart by the ear usually. And
therefore the use of the ear to hear of God and his works, out of his word,
ever cried for in the Scriptures: and the stopping of the same ever condemned,
as to GOD rebellions, and to the soul most hurtful and pernicious. O that it
might sink and settle in all men, for their amendment and increase of care and
conscience to hear.

2. What is Iethro? A Gentile. Where dwelt he? In Midian, a good way of.
Gentiles then hear, and Jews will not; they that dwell far of come, and
they that are near will not. He that but hears is much moved, they that see
with their eyes, and feel with their hands Gods works and mercies, murmr and
repine sinfully. Do not things fall out thus in our days? and find we not
by erperience, to the grief of all good minds, that plenty is no dainty?
would GOD we did not. But let us in time remember what is spoken for our
admonition if we have grace: Many shall come from the East, and West, Math.
8. 11.
and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of
Heaven. And the Children of the 12.
Kingdom shall be cast out into utter darkness: there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. Woe be to thee Chorazin: Math. 11. 21.
woe be to thee Bethsaida: for if the great works which were done in you, had
been done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in sackcloath and
ashes. The Queen of the South shall rise in judgment Math. 12. 42.
with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost
parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon: and behold a greater
than Solomon is here. Then Christ in his person, now Christ in his word, the
same Christ God and man, ever above Solomon who was his creature.

3. Iethro brought with him Moses wife whom he had sent away, and her two
sons. (ver. 3.) The time when he sent her away I do not remember to be
expressed in the Scripture. But of like it was when she showed her self so
cross and weyward about the circumcision of her son, to the hazard of Moses
own life, whom the Lord would have killed for neglect of the Sacrament.
Happily Chap. 4. 24.
he thought she would be cross and headie in other things as well as in that;
and therefore for fear lest she should hinder him in his vocation now imposed
by God, he sent her for a time back with his Children to Iethro her father.
Whereof we may make, me thinks, these two uses; first, that it is a grievous
offense for either wives or others to be an hinderance to men in their duties
enjoined them by God; for this is even to strive against God, and to set our
will against his will, to the great peril both of the men so called, and of
the parties that so hinder them if they persist. Secondly, that it is the duty
of all so called to remove from them in a lawful sort those hinderers:
preferring the Lords work, before their own affection and remembering
zealouslie their Masters words, He that loves Math. 10. 37.
Father, or Mother, more than me, is not worthy of me. And he that loves
Son, or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me. But whosoever shall
forsake Math. 19. 29.
houses, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children,
or Lands, for my names sake, he shall receive an hundredth fold more, and shall
inherit eternal life. This forsaking for a time of Moses was a holy
resistance of his own affections, and a zealous care of his imposed office.

4. And Iethro said to Moses (that is, he sent messengers ver. 6.
to say) I thy Father in law Iethro am come to thee, and thy Wife, and thy two
Sons with her. A singular modesty in Iethro, and reverence to his Son in
law Moses his place: when albeit he had with him those guests that he knew
in nature must needs be welcome, besides his own due who was come so far in
love and kindness: yet he would not come to him without this reverent sending
before to acquaint him. Such reverence to men's places in our days is much
wanting in those that chiefly should perform it; and familiarity breeds
contempt. But behold Iethro here, and know that God has Chronicled this for
his praise, and our profit. Reverence to Magistrates, reverence to Ministers,
reverence to all authority and superiority, certainly it pleases God, and
commends us. The contrary is immodestie, yea impiety, and as a great
contempt of the Author of that authority, as of the party contemned, usually
punished of God either with want of ever having authority, or with such
contempt if they have authority, as erst they measured unto others.

5. How requiteth Moses this kind respect? The Text says. He went out to
meet his Father in law, and ver. 7.
did obeisance and kissed him, and each asked other of his welfare; and they
came into the Tent. No authority and greatness makes him proud or unmindful
of an old friend, who had showed him kindness when he was in a lower estate:
but with a singular humility he receaueth reverence in his place, and with
like respect again boweth himself and reuerenceth Iethro. Such mutual love
and reciprocal offices of complement and order shall you ever see in wise men,
what difference soever is in their places. And there is no greater pride than
where least worth is. Pride makes rude, and rudenes gets little love, we
all know. Such an Example as this, is in stead of an hundred to a wise heart;
and yet you may join David's protestation to it and be much profited, Lord I am
not high minded, I have no proud looks, etc.

6. Then Moses told his Father in law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and
the Egyptians, etc. Being met Ver. 8.
together, after ordinary salutations and kind enquiring one of another
health, they fall to religious and godly talk: Moses taking pleasure to
speak, and Iethro to hear of such gracious favors as the Lord had showed to
his people, and of such powerful judgments as he had laid upon their
enemies. Which may serve for a good motive in our days to cut off idle, if not
very profane conference when we meet, and to lead us this good way;
remembering ever, that of idle words we must give an account. Woe be to the
world because of offenses: for it Math. 12. 36. Math. 18. 7.
must needs be that offenses must come, but woe be to that man by whom the
offense comes, etc. If any man among you seem religious, and refraineth not
his tongue, Iam. 1. 26.
but deceaueth his own heart, this man's religion is in vain. The hearty joy
also that was in Iethro when he heard these things, notably tells us the
right affection of a Child of GOD, when GOD is merciful to his Church or to
any member therefore; he enuieth not, he grudgeth not, much less speaks
ill, but with a very loving joy he is glad and blesses the Name of the Lord
for it. A thing, I fear me, much wanting now a-daies, not only in Country
Christians, and men (as we say) of the Laity endued with less knowledge, but
even in such as be Great men in the Church and of the Clergy. The old Saying
was, Laici infesti Clericis. But in our days, I fear, a Clergy man's chief
enemies are they of his own coat. Such is the rancour and poisoned envy of
these times. God in mercy alter it: and make our hearts like Iethro his heart
here. Gratitude again to God for his mercies is here taught by Iethro, which
is ever a duty due from man: and which being performed moves him to give
more. For as Ambrose says, Gratiarum actio est ad plus dandum inuitatio.
Thanksgiving is a moving of the Lord to bestow more. As ingratitude, out of
doubt, works the taking away of things given. It is written of one
Timotheus, the son of Conon a very good Father a Citizen of Athens, that
after he had proudly said in a great assembly, Haec Ego feci, non Fortuna,
This I have done, and not Fortune, he never after prospered in any thing, but
daily lost that glory which before he had gotten. Much more faulty are they,
that at least in heart, (though by mouth they dare not openly say so,) think
that this, or that, they have gotten or done, and not God. You may think of
that in Daniel. 4. 27. and ever pray against such pride.

7. Then Iethro Moses father in law took burnt offerings and sacrifices to
offer unto God. And Aaron and all ver. 12.
the Elders of Israel came to eat bread with Moses father in law before God.
Having been thankful in words now he adds deeds, that both words and
deeds may go together in honoring God. For A dead faith, says Iam. 2 17.
Romans 10. 10.
S. James, is that, where works want. And as with the heart we believe unto
righteousness, so with the mouth we confess unto salvation, says S. Paul. If
we learn of Iethro, ever to join these together as the Lord shall enable us,
we shall rightly and fully give assurance both to our selves and others of
our true faith. This showed again, that Iethro worshipped the true God,
otherwise (in likelihoode) Moses would not have married his daughter. And if
Iethro here, and Melchisedek, and Naaman and Cornelius with others mentioned
elsewhere in the Scriptures did so, having, for any thing we know, small
preaching or means of true knowledge besides the working Spirit of a gracious
GOD that mercifully pulled them out of the fire: Let us comfortably hope of our
Forefathers living in the time of ignorance, that they found mercy with God.
And yet beware that we reason not from thence to any contempt or neglect of
that blessed light which God vouchsafes now above those times. But ever
remember that singular Speech of Saint Cyprian, Ignosci potuit simpliciter
errantibus, post inspirationem vero Cypr. Epist. 63
et reuelationem factam, qui in eo quo errauerat perseuerat, sine venia
ignorantiae peccat, praesumptione enim et obstinatione superatur. Mercy might
be showed to them that erred of simplicity, but after light granted who shall
so continue in his error, he sins without hope of pardon, being overcome
with presumption and obstinacy. The kind coming of the Elders with Aaron, to
eat and be merry with Moses Father in law, shows their love to Moses and
was a great comfort. Alike custom we have to give a man his welcome (as we
call it) with wine or meat as we think good, which you see is commendable
being used rightly. For most good and joyful it ever was, when men together
agree in love and unity. Many sharp showers Moses was under with these
Israelites; yet here is love and kindness, which tells us GOD will not ever
grieve his servants, Magistrates or Ministers or others faithful, but has his
times to comfort them also, and mingle sweet with their sour, that they may
be able 1. Cor. 10.
to bear and to go along with their vocation. A sweet goodness in him so to
consider our weakness, so to temper things to our strength, and let it work
a love in us of so dear a Father and to a godly carriage in all storms. For
clouds will blow over, and after a foul day comes a fair. Sorrow at night,
joy ere day, says the experienced Psa. 30. 5.
Prophet David, and the Lord in mercy give us the use of all his sweet
comforts.

The 2. part.
1. NOw on the morrow when Moses sat to judge the people, the people stood
about Moses from Ver. 13.
Morning to Even, etc. Amongst the infinite mercies of God vouchsafed to
mankind, this is one great one, that he has appointed Government and
Governors, Judgment, Judges, Justice, and Laws to defend the good, and
repress the evil and unruly. In the 11. Chapter of the Prophet Zach. 11. 7.
Zachary, he calls it a Staff, and a Staff of beauty for the excellency
of it. I took unto me, says the Lord, two Staves; the one I called Beauty,
the other I called Bands, and I fed the sheep. The first staff was the
Government Ecclesiastical and civil which he esiablished amongst them,
called I say Beauty for the profit, comfort and good that comes ever by
Government. His second Staff was peace, unity and concord most mercifully
also vouchsafed unto them, which being indeed a notable holdfast of
happiness in any state, he calls it by the name of Bands. And both these
excellent mercies he calls by the name of Staves, because they have fit
resemblances with those Shepeheard Staves that are used in feeding and tending
the flocks of men. For to speak of Government whereto the Text leads me, the
Shepeheards Staff is said to be a Staff of direction, a staff of correction,
a Staff Virga Directionis Virga Correctionis Virga De^ensionis Virga
Sustentationis.

of defense, and a staff of support or ease: Even so is good and just
Government if you mark it. For it directs a man willing to live in order,
what he shall do, and what he shall not do, as the Staff guides the sheep
in the right way and keeps him from the wrong. It corrects him that will
not be ruled. It defends the oppressed and wronged, and it is a sure stay to
lean and rest upon, when we are toyled with heard dealings of men, as the
staff is for the shepeheard to support him when he is weary. Uery fitly
therefore resembled to a staff, and for the excellency termed not beautiful
in the concrete, but very beauty it self in the abstract. Which Beauty that
it may the more appear unto you, think with your self of these points or
heads. First, what Names are given to Governors in the holy Scriptures and
holy writings of wise men. They are called, you know, Gods, Nursing-fathers,
Nursing-mothers, the 2. Pet. 2. 10. Patres patriae. patres populi. praesidentes
iustitiae. Vindices innocentiae. Custodes patirae.
Ministers of God, Shepherds, and such like, they are called ye Fathers of the
Country, Fathers of the people, the Presidents of Justice, the manteiners of
innocence; the preseruers, of peace, and such like, al to make us see the
Beauty of this staff. Secondly, observe with your self ye course of God
settled in all his creatures; for in the stars, in the beasts, in the birds,
in the fishes, in the trees etc, the Lord has made some chiefer than others,
that we might rise up thereby into a profitable Meditation how beautiful a thing
order, degrees, and government is among men, and especially a monarchy when
one rules over all, for as Saint Hierom well notes among the Bees there is
one chief; and the Cranes in flying follow one. Rome when it was built could
not endure two to rule as chief although they were brethren, and therefore had
her beginning in brothers blood. In Rebeccas womb even two brethren and twins
did strive. Genesis 25. 22.
Adam but one, to govern Paradise. Noah only Governor of the Arc: Moses alone
chief in that government and co^duction Plures in administratione, vnus in
dignitate.
of that people: one David, one Solomon, and so forth. Thirdly, think of the
commandments given in the word to obey Government, and to honor with all
duty and reverence men placed over us in authority, and see in them plainly
how beautiful God esteems them, than whose judgment and wisdom there is no
greater. Fourthly, duly consider that Note which the Scripture gives often of
all wickedness and mischief abounding, because there was no King in Israel;
and of that in Esaias. 3. 5. 2. so fearful. Fifthly, meditate of that
resemblance that is usually made of Government to a Ioyners instrument, whereby
if a board be warped and cast a side, or a wrie, adding heat to it, he can make
it straight again and fit for his use. To a wrest of a musical Instrument
bringing the strings that are out of tune into tune again. Do not these
things show the necessity, use and comfort of it? Lastly, the resemblance to
the state of our bodies, wherein the first qualities of heat, cold, dryness
and moisture being contraries and disagreeing one with another, yet by order,
preportion and a due temperature they are so agreed as they make an excellent
creature. So does Government compose things most cross, and make a sweet
harmony in love and peace. In deed therefore a Staff of beauty is
Government either in public or private as in Salomons house, and they
unworthy of life among men that will not stoop to it, be ruled by it, and
bless God for it evermore. The use of Government is more than of bread, water,
sun, air, etc. of which yet what use have we? for the benefit of Government
is not to make us breathe only, and to eat and drink and be nourished,
(which all yet it does in that it makes us live together sociablie;) but it
farther provides, that Idolatry, sacriledgies, blasphemies, and other offenses
against GOD do not spread themselves among the people, that public peace be
not broken, that every man enjoy his own in safety, that trade and traficke be
preserved among men, honesty and virtue be defended, etc. They that say under
the old Testament it was needful, but not for the perfection of the Gospel,
show no such perfection but that Magistrates are needful to make them better,
and forget that the Psalm does not bid Rulers lay away their offices, but to
kiss the Son, that is, to be subject to Christ, yt he may Psalm. 2. 12.
rule over them, and be above all as he ought to be. And the Prophet Esaias does
not say yt in the time of ye Gospel there must be no Kings or Queens, but
plainly otherwise that they both shall be, and to the Church they shall be
profitable and comfortable, even Nurcing-Fathers and Nurcing-mothers, Esaias 49.
23. And the holy Apostle expressly commands, that prayers and supplications be
made for them, that 1 Timothy 2. 2.
we may by the blessing of their government lead a godly and quiet life under
them. Wherefore you see the grosnesse of this error, andhow bound we are to God
for Magistracy even now in the time of the new Testament, as well as others were
that lived in ye time of the Old. Now this meditation yt they are Gods Deputies
and Uicegere^ts, Gods Ministers and Substitutes here on earth, how many good
things does it teach Magistrates and Governors? It cheereth them up against
all the difficulties of their places which surely are many, and so many, as he
said well that said it. Who so knew the cares annexed to a Kings Crown, would
scarce take it up if it lay before him. They are even like goodly trees under
which in the time of a storm every man will run with have to be shielded and
shadowed from the tempest; but as soon as the storm is past, cast stones at
it and break the boughs of it at their pleasure. It stirs them up most
effectutally to integrity, wisdom, meekness, continency and innocence.
For upon what hope shall they admit iniquity into their Tribunall-seat which
they learn and know to be the Throne of God? How shall they dare to pronounce
a wrong sentence with that mouth which they learn and know to be appointed
Gods instrument for truth? How shall they subscribe wicked acts with that hand
which God has appointed to write his acts? No, no, it will and ought, as I say,
stir-vp to good: even by all means to indeauoure to show some resemblance in
their place of heavenly providence, watchfulness, goodness, love, justice
etc. This did Moses and Iehoshaphat think when they moved the Judges with this
Admonition, That they executed not the judgments of man, but of God; and
therefore 2 Cron. 19. 6.
should take heed etc. Read the places your self I pray you, Deuteronomy. 1. 16. 2.
Chron. 19. 6. Whosoever therefore reject Governors, it may truly be said of
them as was said of such as refused Samuel and would have a King, They have 1.
Sam. 8 7.
not cast thee away, but they have cast Me away. For by Me^ Kings reign etc.
Prou. 8. 15. 1. Pet. 2. 17. The objection Deuteronomy 5. 17. Math 5 21. Esaias. 11. 9.
Esaias. 65. 25.
against government that a Christian may not kill, and that in his holy
mountain there may be no slaying, etc, we easily answer, and say, that the
^aw of God forbids to kill, and yet to punish killers the Lord puts the
sword into the Magistrates hand. Afflict and hurt the godly we may not, but
this is neither to afflict nor hurt, to punish by the Lords commandment those
that do afflict and hurt. For Magistrates (says the Apostle) bear not the
sword in vain, Romans 13. Non est crudelis qui crudeles iugulat, licet
patientibus talis videatur; sed qui malos percutit in eo quod mali sunt,
minister Dei est. He is not cruel that kills the^ which are cruel, although
he seem so to them that suffer; but who so strikes the evil for that they
be evil (meaning, by lawful authority) He is the Minister of God, says S.
Hierom. And again; Homicidas, Hiero^. in Esaias 13 In Ezech. ib. 4. In Iere. 22.
sacrilegos, et venereos punire, non est effusiosanguinis, sedlegu^
ministerium. To punish murderers, sacrilegious, and licentious persons is not
shedding of blood, but the ministry of law. Thus s^ew Moses the Egyptian Act.
7. 28. Exo. 2. 12. Three thousand Idolaters, Exodus 32. 28. Thus commanded David
his Son Solomon touching Ioab and S(...)ei, 1. King. 2. 5. etc. Moses was meek
and David pitiful, yet thus they do: Et vterque manus quas parce^do
inqumasset sic soeuie^do sanctificauit, dum vltione^ sibi a Deo co^missa^
executus est. And either of the^ sanctify their hands by this severity in
executing justice belonging to the^, which otherwise they should have defiled
by unlawful lenity and sparing. Read by your self ye places of Scripture in
ye margin. Only let cruelty in justice Prou. 19. 12. Chap. 20 8 26 Chap 17. 15.
Chap. 24. 24.
be ever far from a godly Governor; for the Kings throne is established by
mercy, and al men's seats under him. Yet again on the other side, Superstitiosa
affectatio clementi^ ^t faciat crudelissimam humanitatem cum pernicie multorum:
Let not a superstitious affectation of clemency make a more cruel gentleness
with the peril and hurt of many. For under the government of the Emperor
Nerua it was rightly said: It is ill dwelling under a king or Magistrate where
nothing is lawful, but it is far worse dwelling under one where all things are
lawful. For the duty of Subjects toward their Gouernoures, it is first to
think most reverently of their places as an authority appointed of God for
our good: and not as some men do, outwardly to obey them and inwardly to
think them but necessary evils. For S. Peter's words teach more when 1. Pet. 2
17.
he says, Honor the King, and Solomon when he bids, Fear God and the
King. For in the word Honor, Peter includes sinceram and candidam
existimationem: A sincere and vnseigned reverence of them. And Solomon joining
the King with God, shows a holy and reverent regard of him to be due to him
from men subject to him. That also in Paul has great efficacy in it, Not for
fear, but for conscience sake. As if he should say: even because Romans 13. 5.
what duty is done or left undone to them, is done or left undone to God
himself from whom their authority and power is. Whatsoever therefore the
person is, the calling is of God and must be so thought of. Again, after this
inward reverent conceit must follow outward obedience to their Laws, in
paying tribute and undergoing what to us by them is appointed either for
public defe^se or otherwise. For, let every soul be subject to the higher
Romans 3. 1. 2.
powers says the Apostle, because he that resists, resists to his own
damnation. And read Tit. 3. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13. The Magistrate may sometimes be
weak, but God will ever be strong to punish any contempt of his ordinance. In
no case therefore may we intrude our selves into their offices and meddle with
public matters without a calling. For this is not to obey them, but to rule
with them. What is amiss to them must be signified, and their help expected,
unless they appoint us, and then are we not private persons any more, but
public for such business. And as Counselors are said to be eyes and ears
to the King, so are other subjects his hands when he pleases to command them
so. And be they never so evil, yet their place is of God by whom only kings
do rule either Dan. 2. 21. and 37.
to our good in his mercy, or to our punishment in his justice. Permittuntur
aliquando tyrannorum imperia a deo in vindictam malefactorum, praemium vero
bonorum. Tyrants Lib. 4. de Cain et Abel. ca. 4.
are suffered sometimes to rule for the punishment of the evil, and the reward
of the good, says S. Ambrose. But how (will you think) for the reward of the
good? The same Ambrose notably says for answer, Nunquam nobis amplius
contulerunt Gentiles, quam cum verberari Christianos atque proscribi ac necari
iuberent. Praemium enim fecit religio Ad Valor. ca. 3^
quod perfidia putabat esse suppliciu^, etc: Never did the Gentiles more for
the Church, than when they commanded the Christians to be beaten, proscribed
and killed. For then did Religion make that a reward, an honor, and a crown
which infidelity reputed a punishment. S. Austin, There is no power but of
God, and therefore, says he, our Savior told Pilate he could have no power at
all over him, except it John. 19. 11. Aug. in Job. 34. contra Pelagium lib. 1.
cap. 62
were given him from the Father. Sed Deus regnare facit hominem hypocritam
propter peccata populi. Tollenda est ergo culpa, vt cesset tyrannorum plaga:
But God does suffer the hypocrite to rule for the sin of the people. And
therefore that sin must be taken away, that the plague of having a tyrant ruler
may cease. What manner of King Nabuchadnezar King Ezech. 29. 19.
of Babel was which destroyed Jerusalem we know; yet God said, Behold, I will
give the land of Egypt unto Nabuchadnezar, and he shall take her multitude and
spoil her spoil, and take her prey, and it shall be the wages of his army
etc, Because he wrought for me (says the Lord. Mark those last words, and
see how evil Rulers are appointed by God for the punishment of such as will
not serve him. And therefore, If a King shall do as is said by Samuel, Chap.

cases God the only helper is to be thought of and prayed unto, who can give a

carrying a gracious ear and eye to prayer proceeding from a penitent heart. etc.

2. The great pains of Moses in sitting to judge the controversies of the
people even from Morning unto Even: mentioned in the 14. verse. what a
commendation is it of him? what an Example unto all those whom God in mercy
has raised up to any like government over their brethren? Surely diligence in
the charge committed to us, is ever sweet unto God and good for our selves. He
that is diligent in his work, says the wisdom of God by Solomon, shall stand
before Princes. Come thou good and faithful Prou 22. 29.
servant, will God say to his Magistrate as well as unto the Minister, and
enter into thy Lords joy. The wicked in their ill doing how diligent are they?
and shall it not move such as be the Lords to carefulnes in well doing? Judas

evil. While men sleep the enemy sows Tares among the good seed that was
sown. If the driuer of horses either strike or speak but to one, all the rest
set themselves to it and amend their paces. Let God and Nature, the Word and
Experience work with wise persons unto good. And for Justice, what a blessing
to the people and what a praise to the careful executer of it who knows not?
Heathen Aristotle could say, that no star is so beautiful in the Nec
Hesperus nec Lucifer formosior iustitia.
sky, as Justice is on earth. Men's wisdom may make them reverenced, and their
power may make the^ feared, but Justice Justice is yt which wins men's hearts
and makes them beloved, and the more faithful and painful they are in doing
thereof, the more honored alive and dead. Look upon Moses in this place.

3. And as Justice is a blessing, so are good laws and ordinances in a
kingdom, in the praise whereof much might be said, as not a little against idle,
superfluous, and hurtful laws, against obscure and deceitful penning of them,
leaving holes and gaps in them, for all ye good intended by them to run out at
and never be seen: but I leave it to your own meditation.

4. In this excellent man Moses, does not Iethro his inferior ver. 19. etc.
far find justly a fault, and very well advise him to a better course which
Moses followed and with Gods approbation? Let it tell us that no man is perfect
in all things, but may receive counsel even from a meaner person. Let Moses
modesty in yielding, make our spirits humble in like occasion, where God
dwells it will be so, and pride is a sure sign of an ill heart. The head
scorneth not the foot in our bodies, and the very foot is careful for the
head. Make use and application of it your self. Time spent in these
meditations is well spent ever, and will please God and profit you.

5. The Properties noted by Iethro to be in Magistrates ver. 21.
and Governors are worthy much observation. Provide men says he, of courage,
fearing God, men dealing truly, and hating covetousness. All great graces, and
shining ornaments in men of authority, as by a several consideration of every
one may well appear. The first is Courage or an invincible constancy,
wherewith al such as are in authority over others to minister justice and
judgment unto them ought to be endued, to the end yt neither by love or hatred
they incline more to one or other than stands with the right of their place,
and to the end that neither with flattering praises, or bitter backbitings of
men given to tempt the good disposition of such Governors, they be moved and
drawn aside, discouraged or set down in the work of their Calling, but what
is just and right that soundly and reundly they do, ministering justice to all
without fear or fainting, looking to him that must judge them, and who will
assuredly reward their well doing, and justly punish all their deprauers and
hinderers. In the Book of Chronicles we read it for no small blemish in a
King, and no small rod to the people under him that Rehoboam the son and
successor of Solomon was but a child, meaning in heart and courage, 2. Chron.
13. 7.
that is (in deed) weak and faint hearted, and so could not resist those vain
and wicked men which made themselves strong against him. Therefore God willed
Joshua to be strong and of a most valiant courage. A good Exhortation Joshua. 1.
7.
gave David to Solomon his Son, saying, Be strong and show thy self a man;
for I go the way of all 1. King. 2. 2.
the earth, etc. Such godly fortitude was in the Apostle when he said, We are
reviled and yet we bless; we are 1. Cor. 4. 12. 12.
persecuted, and suffer it. We are evil spoken of, and we pray: etc. Meaning,
that he gave not over or fainted in his duty for all these things. The
second is the fear of God, a virtue also most requisite in Judges, for
hereupon hang all virtues, as might at large be showed if it were needful.
But let that Example of Abraham suffice, who thinking that the fear of God was
not in Gerar, utterly Genesis 20. 11.
despaired of any other virtue, and therefore moved his wife to say she was
his sister. In this respect the fear of God is both by David and Solomon
called, the beginning of wisdom; that is, the root and fountain of all
goodness, and therefore of all Justice and true Judgment in Judges. The third
is a love of truth and true dealing; for who more than Judges should be free in
themselves, and abhor in all others traude and deceit, lying and false
witness bearing, by which all Justice must needs be ouer-throwne, the wicked
justified, and the haltar put about the true man's neck to the great offense of
God, and the fearful punishment of the Judge, that not loving truth, or not
so careful for it as he ought, has suffered such iniquity to be done? The
last is, that Judges be haters of Covetousness the plague and poison of all
Justice, as might be showed by much proof, were I willing to stand upon so
known a Common place. It stops eyes, it stops ears, it tieth tongues,
and works wonders woeful and hateful, etc. To men of this sort, that is,
endued with these virtues above said, authority happily (and to the great
good of many thousands) is given, and God for his mercy sake increase the
number of them. In Deutro. these things will come to be spoken of again, and
therefore I am here the shorter.

CHAP. 19.
AT this Chapter begins the second part of this Book of Exodus, wherein you
have these points. First, a Preparation of the people to hear the laws of
God, delivered by God himself to them, for the government of their lives and
actions, and that is in this 19. Chapter. Secondly, the Laws them selves in
the next Chapter. Thirdly, other Laws tending to the explication of these 10.
principal Laws, called the 10. Commandments: together with the punishments
of the transgressors, Chap. 21. 22. and 23. Fourthly, Moses ascending up to the
Mount, first with the Elders, after without them all alone, and his receiving
direction for the Tabernacle, and the worship of God, Chap. 24. unto the 32.
Fifthly, the sin of the people, their punishment and Moses prayer for them to
the 35. Chap. where certain laws are also repeated. Lastly, the building of
the Tabernacle, the gifts given, the finishing, erection, and dedication to the
end of the Book.

The Preparation is general and particular. The general has first an
Argument drawn from the authority of the speech, to wit, that Moses did not
command out of his own bead, but was called up to the Mount to God, and ver.
3.
there was required to say to the house of Jacob and to tell the children of
Israel, etc. Secondly, an argument drawn from the former benefits of God to
them, in these words, Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I
carried Ver. 4.
you upon Eagles wings, and have brought you unto me. Thirdly, an Argument from
future benefits, If you will hear my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
then ver. 5.
you shall be my chief treasure above all people, though all the earth be
mine: Ye shall be to me a Kingdom of ver. 6.
Priests, and an holy Nation. All which if you will apply unto your self and
make use of them, then may you in like sort ever stir up your heart and prepare
your mind to good things, in this sort, and by the self same Arguments. As
for Example, to go to the Church and to join with the Congregation both in
prayer and hearing of the word preached. First, because it is not man's
Commandment, but God requires the Minister to call and speak to you for it,
as here he did Moses. Secondly, the favors of God passed to you require it.
Thirdly, future favors (if you do it) shall be added unto you. It is also worthy
marking still, how he joins here hearing and keeping together, saying, If you
will hear my voice indeed, and keep my covenant. Keep without hearing you
cannot, and hearing without keeping will never profit you or any. Joined
therefore you see they must needs be, as the Lord shall make us able.

Moses doing as God bad him, teaches all Ministers to be faithful, and to
do their Message. Many are the ver. 7.
Commandments in Scripture to them to speak, to cry, to lift up their
voices like trumpets, and to tell their people what God requires. If they do
it, great is their reward with God, and if they be false, and idle, and
negligent, men-pleasers, and time-seruers, as great again is their judgment.
Grandis est dignitas sacerdotum, and grandis est ruina, si peccant. Great is
the dignity of Priests by their office, and as great is the fall of them, if
they offend. It can never be too often repeated, nor too much remembered.

The peoples answer to Moses what is it? They answered ver. 8.
all together and said, all that the Lord has commanded we will do. A most
notable pattern for a Christian congregation to look upon, and to follow.
Thus should it be betwixt Pastor and People ever. He to speak what God
commands, and they to hear and answer zealously, we will, we will do what
God commands us. O sweet joy where this agreement is! Such care and such
conscience both in pastor and people, will give no place to iarres and
contentions, to suits and vexations, or to any thing that displeases God, and
is offensive to the world, etc.

2. The particular preparation follows, from the 9. verse to ye end of the
Chapter, having 4 members. First, the manner of Gods Communicating of himself
to Moses, namely, in a thick cloud, together with ye end thereof, that the
people ver. 9.
may hear, whilst I talk with thee, and that they may believe thee for ever.
A singular instruction to all men in the world, that desire to please God: and
especially to Great Ones, showing them how careful they should be to grace and
countenance the Ministers of the word before the people, to the end their
words may have more weight with their hearers, and their service and pains
do more good. Would men do thus, O how comfortable to the painful and
faithful Teacher, and how profitable to the Church would it be? The Lord
would see it and acknowledge it done for him, and with eternal comforts reward
it for ever. But now it is otherwise with too many. For Great men must show
their greatness in disgracing the Lords Prophets, and meaner men must show
their malice in spreading false rumors of their spiritual Teachers in open
assemblies and private conuenticles: motes are made mountains, and spots
surmised where none are. Never I think since the world was, did men's ears so
itch and their hearts so boil in this sin, as at this day. But what shall
we say? Surely, even turn to the Lord in prayer, and comfort our selves in
this example of the Lords goodness, who as he is not Moses his God alone, nor
Moses alone his messenger: so will not he tie his countenance only to him, but
give every true labourer in his good time his due credit, notwithstanding all
the malice of man and Devil. O Lord do it for thy Name sake, and as thou
gracedst here Moses that he might ever be believed, so couuert or confound
these Disgracers of thy Ministers; whose iniquity tends to hinder Belief,
and consequently to destroy the souls of thy poor people. Increase the
number of them that follow thy example, and labor by all means to further
thy work in the hands of thy workmen. Set a Crown of glory upon their heads:
and daily reward their love into their bosoms with thy good blessings unto
them and theirs.

3. The second branch of this particular preparation is laid down in the 10.
verse, and the rest following to the 16. consisting in certain outward matters
used in those times among those people: and figuratively teaching inward
purity and cleanenes of heart to come to God with all. As washing of their
clothes, not coming at their wives, and such like. The Ceremonies are taken
away, but the ver. 14. ver. 15.
truth remains, namely, that we are all by our corruption most unfit,
profitably to hear the word of God, unless we be sanctified and prepared
thereunto by the good Spirit of God. And therefore we ought to make ready for
so holy a work by all due care before hand, and to purge our hearts from other
cares, troubles, and impediments whatsoever. The word of GOD is not to be
handled with unclean hands, neither will enter into unclean hearers. It is a
precious pearl, it should not be cast before Swine. For this cause assuredly
many hear and read without profit, because they came without fear and
reverence in their minds. This abstaining from their wives, notes no
impuritie in holy Matrimony: but by this particular figuratively teaches a
godly abstinence from all worldly pleasures whatsoever in general for a time;
that we may more fully attend the service of God we go about upon special
occasion. To which end the Apostle Paul also requires the like by consent for
a time, to give themselves 1. Cor. 7. 5.
to fasting and prayer, and then to come together again, that they be not
tempted of Satan to incontinencie. Thomas Aquinas himself could say thus of
it, Hoc ex sepeccatum non erat, sed multa tunc ad carnis munditias exigebantur,
quae iam non sunt necessaria: quia lex uostra spiritualem munditiam requirit,
non carnis. This was not a sin of it self, but many things were then
required to the outward clensing of the flesh, which are not now necessary:
because our law requires spiritual cleanenes, not an outward of the flesh
only, etc.

4. The marks that are set about the Mount to keep the people down, with the
punishment of death if they passed bounds, teach us what an odious thing to GOD
curiosity is in matters forbidden: and how God would have every man content
with that which it pleases him to vouchsafe him of revelation and knowledge.
Such curiosity is it to ask, what God did before he made the world? and such
like foolish Questions. To all which it may be answered, as God would not have
the people to creep up to the mountain, and to peep and pry what Moses did
there with him, but set bounds and limits for them, beyond which they should
not pass without death: So is it still. The Lord has in his Word revealed his
Will, and beyond our limits we must not go, having an ear where he has not
a mouth. If we do, for this busy curiosity we shall dye eternally, as they
for that, temporally, etc.

5 And the third day, when it was morning, there ver. 16.
were thunders and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mount: and the sound
of the trump exceeding loud, so that all the people that was in the camp, was
afraid. This is the third branch of the particular preparation reaching unto
the 20. verse and containing an increase of the Lords manner of the
communication of himself, specified before in the 9. verse. By all which
fearful things the Lord declared his Majesty says Chrysostom, and the
people were touched with a feeling knowledge of their infirmity. But besides
that, we may well learn by it how profitable it is to make a good and
careful hearer of Gods voice. First to shake him and throw him down in
himself by some good ways and means: For then assuredly the Word enters
more powerfully, and he has a more excellent touch than without such humbling
he would ever have had. Remember how the Lord called S. Paul when he was riding
to Damascus, First throwing Acts. 9. 4. 3.
him down, and by making a sudden light shine about him from heaven, and then
when he trembled, and was aston^ed, speaking to him with profitable effect.
Remember also how there came suddenly from heaven a sound as of a rushing and a
mighty wind in an other place. Surely such rushings and shakings and
spiritual frightings in conscience Acts 2. 2.
has the Lord his gracious meaning in, to beat us down in our selves, that
we may more carefully hearken unto him. And because the greater part of men is
not acquainted with them, therefore they remain dull hearers and dull hearted,
so that the Preacher loses but his labor with them. How many have profited
in sickness by words spoken, who in health never cared what was spoken? so in
debt and poverty, in prison and trouble men have other ears than they have in
prosperity. Does not our Chronicle mention a Gentleman who at his death vowed
openly that he had learnd more good touching his soul in a dark hole within
the Tower of London in a few days, than ever in all his life, when he was in
light and liberty abroad? Full well knows God the way to win us; and happy
are we if it please him to use it, how sharp soever it be; that yet we may
live hereafter in joy, though presently for a season we taste of woe. I could
tell you by experience (if it were needful) of some that have said to my
self, they had heard many Sermons and read the Scriptures, but they never felt
either Sermon or Scriptures as then when they so spoke, being some way touched
in-wardly by their loving God. But be Judge your self in your self if you
know any thing.

Again, these signs showed the terror of the law to men's consciences: for it
thunders, it threatens, it fears and frighteth, and it utterly condemns all
men to Hell and damnation, were there not a CHRIST to save us from it. The law
causes wrath says the Apostle, that is, it denounces wrath against us for
that we cannot Romans 4. 15.
keep it. When Judas could see nothing but the Law, his agony drane him to
hang himself. So was Saul, Achitophel and many others driven to desperate
conclusions and fearful ends. Wherefore the Apostle well adds yt we are not
come to this fearful mount, nor unto burning Heb. 12. 18. etc. 21. 22.
fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest etc, so terrible, that
Moses said, I fear and quake. But we are come unto the Mount Sion, and to the
City of the living God, the celestial Jerusalem, and to the company of
innumerable Angels etc. AND TO JESUS THE MEDIATOR 24.
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT etc. Here, here is our help against the law, without
whom we were cast away every one of us: for cursed is he and she that does not
all things written in the law.

6 This descending of the Lord we must understand of the Signs of his
pretense, and not that the Lord is here and not there, or there and not here,
moving from place to place as man does. Neither speaks he as man does, but
his Angel in his person takes by his power the voice of man, and as God is
said to speak by his Ministers here, so by his Angels then and there as he
pleased. Remember Steuens words in the Acts, This is he, (meaning Moses) Acts
7. 38.
that was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel WHICH SPOKE TO
HIM IN MOUNT SINA etc. The iterating of his commandment to Moses to see that
the people pass not their limits which we touched before ver. 21. and 24.
shows the itching nature of man after hidden secrets, to see and know
novelties: And the great dislike God has of this curiosity, and how
profitable the presence of the Magistrate is to make people keep order. For
surely men are marvelous apt to transgress, and therefore again and again
they must be admonished by Moses: and well if many or any admonitions will
serve. Give laws never so good, and let there not be a Governor to see to
the execution of them, and we see with grief what little good such laws do.
Well therefore and wisely have they spoken who said, Lex Magistratus mutus, et
interdum mortuus: Magistratus lex loquens et viua. The Law is a dumb
Magistrate, and sometimes a dead: but the Magistrate is a speaking Law and a
living.

7 The Priests also are mentioned as well as the people Ver. 24.
that they likewise should not pass their limits: whereby we see that no
dignity authority or higher place may be a warrant to do more than God
permits. But rather should these before others give example of sobriety and
order. What Priests were now, when as yet the Priesthood was not established,
men differ in opinion; some thinking they were the firstborn, and others
thinking otherwise, as Calvin for One vpen this place, to whom I refer such as
will, and go no further in this Chapter.

CHAP. 20.
1. THe Congregation being prepared (as you have heard) to receive The sum
of this Chapter.
ye Law, now in this Chap. follows the Law it self, and it is set down in
ten several branches and heads, commonly called the Decalogue or Ten
Commandments. Of all which because I have made exposition in a Book
already, I will spare my labor here, and refer you to that Treatise. The
other general head of this Chap. to wit, the peoples fear, beginning at the
18. verse, I will a little touch. First then it is said, That all the people
saw the thunders and Ver. 18.
lightnings, and the sound of the Trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when
the people saw it, they fled and stood a far of: which words yield us many good
things to note.

First the difference of the Law and the Gospel. The law, as has been said,
fearing and frighting, shaking and shiuering the heart of Man, beats down
his peacocks feathers and makes him abashed and ashamed in himself, to cry
with the prodigal Son, I am not worthy, I am not worthy, O Father, to be
called thy son. Yea it Luke. 15. 19.
makes him stand a far of with the poor Publican, and smite Luke. 18. 13.
his breast in true feeling of his sin: and to beseech God for mercy to a
Sinner. Whosoever is not thus humbled, he never knew what the law meant, but
like the vain Pharisie doteth upon himself without cause, and erreth as the
Apostle did before the Commandment came. Contrariwise, Romans 7. 9.
the Gospel cheereth and comfort, helps and heals and sweetly allureth
to come, in all joyful assurance of mercy by him who has fulfilled the law
for us, and removed away the curse that would have slain us. Read ye 12.
Chap. to the Hebrews noted before, and see what I say most plain, beginning
at the 18. verse.

Secondly, it may teach us to our great good now whilst we have time, that if
the law were so terrible when it was given, it will be a dreadful day when all
the breaches of the same shall be judged. And if the people fled now, stood a
far off, and were in such fear, how will the Idolater, the Blasphemer, the
Adulterer, the Drunkard, the Thief, the Murderer, the Rebellious and
Disobedient, the false witness, the couetuous oppressor, and all such jolly
fellows that now scorn and scoff at all admonitions, I say, how will all
these do, and what will be their case at that day? Turn, turn we then unto
God in time, and amend your lives, that Christ freeing us from this fearful
law, we may be safe by his holy Gospel.

Thirdly, this place shows their ignorant folly, that say in their hearts, O,
if I might hear God speak himself, I should be much moved, I should
believe, and be out of all doubt etc: For were ye people here able to endure
ye voice of God? Do they not say to Moses? talk thou with us, and we will
hear: but let not God talk with us, lest we ver. 19.
dye. Little, little do they conceive (which thus say) either their own
weakness, or ye Majesty of God. Let them therefore learn of this people here,
the blessing of God in giving us Moses to speak to us, ye is, in raising up
among us men of our own shape, mould and matter, men that we fear not, but
know and love and are linked to in degrees of love to speak unto us in his
Name, putting his holy spirit among them, and induing them with gifts fit for
such a calling, in vouchsafing his Word to direct both them and us: and so
every way familiarlie, and yet truly and effectually, laboring and working our
salvation, if we be not obstinate to contemn his means and care. This
Ministry of Man so despised of Man, so wronged and so cast down, is an other
manner of mercy than wicked worldlings conceive or feel: but one day they
shall know, when it will be too late to reform their fault, which now they may
leave, if they have grace. Then shall they see God, and hear God, but with
greater terror than this people did here. They shall also see blackness and
darkness, they shall hear thundrings and lightnings, smokes and fires and
flames with trembling perplexity, and then, if it could be had again, Moses
voice to speak unto the^ would be accepted, which now is so little regarded
and set by.

Fourthly, This darkness wherein God was, notes the Majesty of God to be
incomprehensible, and not to be reached ver. 21.
unto by our wits. We must therefore be sober and modest, and humble in talking
and writing of God. Simonides found this, when undertaking to show what God
was, the more he studied to do it, the more time still he craved, and was
further and further off. First he asked three days, and then six, and then
double again, and in the end gave over and could not do it. To us this place
may be in stead of a thousand. But Moses drew near unto the darkness where
God was. GOD dwells in light, but in regard of our weakness it is darkness:
and happy we, if we acknowledge our weakness and crave help where it is
to be had. Other things your self may note which I pass over. The great
charge that God gives to beware any Images of ver. 23.
him, either of Gold or Silver you may confer with the 4. Chap. of Deuteronomy. with
ye second Commandment, whereof I have spoken, and settle in your heart how
odious to God that course is from which yet no persuasion will draw some. If
God would be remembered by an Image, he would have suffered it, if he would be
worshipped in an Image, he would have suffered it, and he would have letten
them see some form which they might have followed, and if he could like of an
Image of wood, or stone, more fit for his Majesty were gold and silver. But
you see al is for bidden, and cursed with them are the makers of them, which is
a fearful thing if it were thought of. Read Esaias 45. ver. 16.

2 An Altar of earth shall thou make etc. God would ver. 24.
have but one Altar, to note one truth, and one Religion. He would have it of
earth, or rude and without labor, that vhen they removed they might throw it
down, or it fall of it self, so that posterity might take no cause of
Idolatry thereby. Steps to the same Altar he forbids likewise, Ver. 26.
for the cause specificd in the margin of your Bible, and it well teaches that
in Gods Worship all things should be done devoutly and comely, even as the
Apostle himself teaches and requires. Ignorant and profane men delight in
pomp and earthly show, but Christians must endeavor to have all thiugs done
so modestly, and soberly, as to every man it may appear what spirit they are
guided and governed by. The multitude of Popish Altars might here be remembered
if it were needful, and that good decree of the second Council of Africa
Chap. 50. and the fifth of Carthage Chap. 14. That such suspicious Altars as
were in those days set-up in every corner* should be plucked down, being
built upon dreams and superstitious conceits. And if without tumult they
could not be pulled down, then the people to be admonished not to frequent
those places, lest they should be abused by superstition, etc. Also it might be
showed how the communion tables be called of the old Fathers both tables and
Altars indifferently. Tables as they are indeed, and Altares as they are
improperly. How they were made ofboords, and remooueable, set in the midst of
the people, and not placed against a wall, with diverse other things: but
hereafter will be a fitter place.

CHAP. 21.
1. THe Laws of God are usually divided into moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial
Laws. In the Chapter before we have had the Moral Laws, to wit, the Ten
commandments; herafter we shall have ye Ceremonial. And now in these three
Chapters following God lays down certain Judicial Laws. The Moral Law of
God is the law of Nature, showing what ought to be the manners and natures of
all men, and it is the ground of all Laws whatsoever, either Divine, or
Humane. The Ceremonial being in this respect Natural, because among men Nature
requires order and decency: And the Judicial being the execution of the
Moral which is Natural. For humane Laws they are made by probable reason of
Governors and tend either to directions to keep the Moral, or to
circumstances of execution in punishing offenders. As for example, Gods law
says, Thou shall not kill, Man's Law forbids the carrying Chap. 20. 13.
of these and these weapons, so to take away occasion and means of breaking
the law of God. Gods law commands there shall be Magistrates, Man's law
appoints these are those. At Rome two Consuls, in other Cities four. At Rome
annual, in other places perpetual etc. Gods law appoints that a Debtor not
able to pay shall be punished. Man's law appoints differing ways, according to
circumstances of places: as in some countries by perpetual imprisonment, in
other places otherwise. Draco his law was, That he should be plucked in pieces,
and every Creditor have a part: The Law of GOD requires theft to be punished
by restitution of double Exodus 22. 1. Ratio singularu^ legum que dicitur anima
legum, ex Decalog* sumenda est. Valent enim leges positiuae propter duas
causas, scilicet propter probabilem ratione^ ex iure Naturae er circumstantijs
petita^, et propter authoritate^ Magistratus a quo prolatae sunt. Chap. 20. 12.
Ver. 2.
or four fold. Man's law by restitution, and somewhere by death. By all which
examples you see how GODS law is still the ground of man's law and the end of
man's law (if a good law) is ever the keeping of GODS law. Now to come to the
Text of this Chapter. The first law laid down is touching servants and
servitude, which you may refer to the Moral law, Honor thy Father and
Mother. Degrees of men concerning ruling and obeying being contained in the law.

The words of the Text are these, If thou buy an Hebrew servant, he shall serve
six years, and in the seventh, he shall go free, for nothing, etc. From
which verse to the twelfth verse you have the matter of servitude and freedom
laid down: and it shall be good to observe the Will of God in it. He would
not have them ever bond, as amongst the Nations elsewhere it was; because they
were delivered out of Egypt by his mercy, as^el as their Masters were:
whereupon in Leuiticus he challenges them for his, and says, For they are my
servants, whom I brought Leuit. 25. 42.
out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen are sold. Thou
shall not rule over them cruelly, but 43.
shall fear thy God. Yet would he not have the Master damnified, and
therefore he allows of 7. years, commanding their liberty, and recompense
saying, when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shall not let him go
away Deutro. 15. 13
empty. The use whereof is comfortable to servants, and profitable to Masters.
To servants it shows the loving care the Lord has over them, which may
cheer them in all their doings, being well assured, that what they do well
this God will ever reward, though man do not. Whereunto serves the
exhortation of the Apostle and promise annexed. Servants, be obedient unto them
that are Colloss. 3. 22.
your masters according to the flesh, in all things, not with eye service as
men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. And whatsoever you do,
do, it heartely as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that of the Lord ye
shall 23. 24.
receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. And y^
very like Saying again he has to the Ephesians. So rewarded he the faithful
service of Jacob Ephesians. 6. 5.
though his master were hard; so Joseph, so many mo. To Masters it teaches
moderation and mercy: for how dare they wrong those whom God calls his, and
has such a tender care of? The Apostle in the places named, so says also. Ye
Masters do unto your servants, that which is just and equal, knowing that ye
also have a Master in Heaven. Colloss. 4. 1.
Where this is not done, God is angry; as you may see by that fearful speech
in Jeremy. Because ye have not obeyed Ier. 34. 17.
me in proclaiming a liberty to your servants etc, therefore behold I proclaim
a liberty to you says the Lord, to the sword, to the Pestilence, and to the
famine, and I will make a terror to all the Kingdoms of the earth. Read the
place from the 9. Verse to the end of the Chapter. Job therefore a good and
just man, had a great care of this, and protests he did not contemn the
judgment of Job. 31. 13.
his servant, and of his maid, when they did contend with him, because he
that made him in the Womb, he also made them, and if he should wrong them,
what could he answer to God for it? A most worthy example for all Masters.
Thus may all other governors and Superiors make use of this law, and learn
to take no pride in their authority, not to affect greatness, and not to
swell and look big over their inferiors. For certainly the Lord will punish
it, and al wise men will laugh at it. Rule and government is of God, but pride
and vanity is of the Devil. Titles to men God will have given, but to desire
Titles he never liked, much less Titles upon Titles and never enough. It
Ambrose. lib, 5 exam. cap. 21.
sounds in Books to the Persians shame, that the governors there, will be
free from all laws, and what they list, that they may: But theirinferiours
must be bound with Strabo. lib. 5.
all cruel bonds, even to kill themselves if they command, and to endure al
burdens imposed upon them: If they be cruelly beaten, to give thanks that the
Governors have them in remembrance. The Pharisees were vain men to affect the
uppermost places, and to be called Rabbi. But this proud mind is like the
water to the Dropsie-man that makes more thirsty the more it is drunk. No

with some men. They that are noble will be Princes; Princes will be Kings;
Kings will be Emperors; and Emperors must be Gods. That vain woman
Cleopatra, she must be called Queen of Queens. Sapor the Regina Reginarum.
Persian wrote to Constantius, and called himself King of Kings, and brother
to the stars, the Sun and the Moon, etc. These that thus hunger after
glory and Majesty, how can they use authority moderately and humbly? Such
pride comes out of the root of folly, and begets contempt of all
inferiors, contempt breeds sedition and rebellion, they wars, and war
destruction at last of all, both men and titles. It is written of Traian that
he was much carried away with vainglory in titles: and therefore painted in
his house many inscriptions, which Constantinus wisely jesting at, called
Herbam parietariam, wall flowers. Such a vain fellow was Herod in the Acts,
and what a shameful downfall had he? Let then this law of Acts. 12. 22. and
23.
God for servants freedom, together with all other Scriptures, showing his
care of them, and their good usage, settle in our hearts the right use of
anthoritie, and make us neither vain in coveting nor cruel in using. The
boring of his ear, was a sign of obedience, and figuratiuelie ver. 6.
admonished, that servants must not be deaf, but quick and ready, and willing
to hear what is commanded to them. And spiritually, that if we be the Lords
servants, he boreth by his holy grace our ear, that is, he makes us have
ears to hear his holy word, and we are not dease, we fly not from it, we
cast it not away, we stop not our ears: but with care and zeal, and love, we
hearken to it, as men and women whose ears he has opened or bored. This one
thing well marked may shake the hearts and consciences of Popish Recusants, so
presumptuouslie despising the Lords voice: But follow it your self, I pass
away.

2. After these laws concerning servants, follow other laws concerning Murder
and killing, which you may refer to the exposition of that commandment.
Punishment God still lays upon sin, but not ever after one manner.
Sometimes he strikes the body, sometimes the soul, and sometimes both.
Sometimes he touches our goods, sometime our name, and sometimes our friends
and dear ones. Who can reckon up his ways to punish the rebelling man or
woman against him? His ends also for which he does thus are sundry and diverse,
but all and ever most just. First, for his own justice who is a consuming 1.
fire, and must needs bind either to obey or to be punished. Secondly, that
there may be seen a difference 2. Oderunt peccare boni etc. 3.
betwixt the good and the bad, which could not be, if there were not punishment
and reward. Thirdly, for example, that others seeing, may fear and fly from
evil, either for love of virtue, or fear of pain. Fourthly, for the good 4.
even of such as are punished. For as Plato could say, Paenae, and ipsis qui
perferunt, et spectatoribus, vtiles sunt. Vtrique Omnes poenaemu^di sunt
conciones de paenite^tia. 5.
enim redduntur meliores, illi dolor, hi exemple. Punishment is good for both
seer and sufferer, amending the one by example, and the other by smart. Fifthly,
that these short punishments temporal, might put them in mind of the long
pains eternal. Lastly, for the preservation of the society and peace of
mankind, which by slaughters and bloodshed Est immedi^abile vulnus ense
recidendum, ne pars sincera tr^hatur.
would be overthrown. Even as we see good Chirurgions to cut away the
putrified member, for the safety of the whole.

3. We see here degrees of faults taken from the causes. For all actions
proceeding from the mind or judgment and the will commanding the outward
members, when the mind knows what ought to be done, and erreth not in the
object, and yet the will goes contrary to judgment and the law of God not
forced nor compelled, but willingly and freely, such actions are called
voluntary. So slew Caine his brother Abell, and so took David Vrias his
wife. But when things are done not of election, either for probable ignorance
(as when the mind erreth, or takes no counsel) or when the will by violence
is hindered, or the Dolus. Culpa lata. Culpa leuis et leniss. Casus fortuitus
vt ille canem lapide pete^s nouerca^ ferit. Has patitur poenas peccandi sola
voluntas. Na^ scelus intra se tacitu^ qui cogitat vllum, Facti crimen habet.
Ver. 13.
outward members by a violence forced, then are those faults said to be
voluntary. The Lawyers distinguish faults by diverse names, which I stand not
upon here, remembering for whose use, I draw these notes: But in short, thus
much we learn here, that God measures faults by will, and not by Act.
Whereupon it is here said, that wilful murder shall be death, and killing
without purpose and will shall not, but an other course is taken. For if a man
has not laid wait (says the Text) but God has offered him into thy hand
(meaning when by chance he is killed without any mind so to do, which chance
yet God by his hidden providence guides) in such a case I will appoint thee a
place whither he shall fly; meaning certain Cities of refuge or Sanctuaries
used the^ in these cases, as you may see in Deuteronomy. at large. Of which
Sanctuaries thus ordained of God for Chap. 19. 11.
ye people and those times, sprang our sanctuaries used within this Realm and
others, but now in most places put down and forbidden. The question of them is
disputed to and fro by men's wits, and the likers of them to continue, use these
and such other reasons. The Anger and conceived displeasure in the Judge
against a man; The power of his adversary that persecuteth before that judge;
The Difficulty and obscurity of the cause not quickly to be determined. In all which cases they think a Sanctuary would be fit in a common wealth.
Secondly, against cruelty of Masters that either should threaten danger to a
servant, or by violence seek to force him to soul matters, such a refuge
would yield comfort till his cause were known and he preuided for. Thirdly, in
the time of war and distres, these places gave safety to many from the
bloody sword and murdering hand of enraged enemies, for fury a while not
weighing right. Fourthly, in casual killings without pretended malice, great
was the use and equity (say they) of these Sanctuaries. Contrariwise they that
stand for the taking of them away, allege many evils and discommodities that
grew from them in success of time, through man's corruption, albeit at the
beginning there was a goodend: As encouragement of servant to be
disobedient, and very undutiful. Great defrauding of Creditors by ungodly and
unconscionable debtors. Increasing of thieues and such like euilles many and
many. Whereupon grew that good Saying of Saint Chrysostom. Nullos tam saepe ad
ecclesiae asylum fugere, quam qui nec Deum nec ecclesiam curabant. None more
usually and often fled to the Sanctuary of the Church, than they that cared
neither for God nor the Church. If a man come presumptuously upon his Ver. 14.
neighbor to slay him with guile, you see God commanded no Sanctuary should
save him, but he should be taken from the Altar, and dye.

4 He that smites his Father or Mother, shall dye the death. This is an other
law in this Chap. which makes for ye exposition of that Commandment of
honoring them, and is to be referred to it. We may note in it, how God does
not say, he that kills Father or Mother shall be killed for it; but he that
smites, so that not so much as a tip is to be given to parents upon pain of
death, no not which the tongue may we smite them, that is, by any evil and unfit
words abuse them, as you may at large read in the exposition of that
Commandment. So great is the honor of Parents before God, and so sharp a
Judge is God against all abusers of them: Little thought of by too many in our
days, and the rather because continually in the Church there is not a beating
of these points of Catechism into Childrens heads, and hearts, by careful
Ministers. O, that they would be once drawn to do this duty in their
several Churches: Soon, soon should they find the Fruit of it, and the
greatness of their Sin in so long neglecting it. In Plato an heathen we
read the like law, wherein is decreed that all beating and contumelies of
Parents should be punished with perpetual banishment and death. By the Roman
laws the slaier of his parents was not to be slain either with sword or fire,
or other ordinary punishment, sed in sutus culeo, etc. sowed in a sack with a
Dog, a Cock, a Viper, and an Ape, he should be thrown into the Sea or
River, that the air whilst he lived, and the earth when he was dead might be
denied him, who so had wronged them that gave him a life and being in the air
and upon the earth. A good Writer testifies he saw one put to death at
Tigurine who had cursed and reviled his Mother.

5 He that steals a Man and sells him, if he be ver. 16.
found with him, shall dye the death. To flock away (as we speak) a man's
servant, Man or Maid, or to buy Plagium.
or sell a freeman, and so to bring him into bondage, was a grievous sin with
God, and therefore thus severely punished. Thus sinned the brethren of Joseph
against him, when they sold him to be a bondsman, and to be used as pleased the
buyers, which might have been so as twenty deaths had been better. Great
therefore was their sin in that action. This law is to be referred to the 7.
Commandment and to the 5. also.

6. When men strive together, and one smite an other with the stone, or with
the fist, and he dye not, but lies in ver. 18.
bed, If he rise again and walk without upon his staff, then shall he that
smote him go quite (meaning for man's ver. 19.
law) save only he shall bear his charges for his loss of time, and shall
pay for his healing. By the stone or fist are meant all other things whereby
any wound is given, although these only be named for example. For with sword
or dagger or any weapon all was one, if he were wounded and recovered so, that
he was as fit for his vocation as before, then this was the law; but if he
were maimed, then otherwise. If a man smite his servant or his ver. 20.
maid with a rod, and he dye under his hand, he shall surely be punished; But
if he continue a day or two, he shall ver. 21.
not be punished; for he is his money. These laws of God were fitted for the
state of that people, when many things were endured which were not allowed. If
the servant dyed presently, it was more grievous, and therefore punished, but
if he lived a time after, not so; yet before God it was murder also, though by
Man's law he escaped both in regard he was his money in his masters power, and
also because there might in that day or two happen some other cause of death
than that beating. Perfection in these laws we must not look for, because
God was pleased to bear with much weakness; But yet know we ever what his
Moral law requires, and follow that which forbids the abusing of servants
as well as of others, because they also bear the Image of God, and God cares
for them, as has been showed.

7 If a man strive and hurt a Woman with child, so ver. 22.
that her child depart from her, and she yet dye not, he shall be surely
punished as the woman's husband shall appoint him, or he shall pay as the
Arbiters determine. But if ver. 23.
death follow, the^ shall he pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth 24. 25.
for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for
wound, stripe for stripe, etc. Still observe how these laws tend to the
explanation of some of the Ten Commandments, and refer this to the fifth. The
light of Reason and Nature given us of God teaches, That what measure we mete,
it is just we should receive Luke. 6. 38. Math. 26. 52. Esaias. 33. 1. Wild. 11.
13,
even the like again: That he that takes the sword should perish with the
sword: That he which spoileth should be spoiled: That by what a man sins, by
that he should be punished: That what a man does, the same he should suffer:
That evil should hit the worker, and the offender be pressed with his own
example. This law of equality was in effect thus also in the 12. Tables at
Rome, the equity thereof being derived to them either from other Nations or
by the light of Nature. The verse says

Iusta malis haec, admisso pro crimine, paena est,
Si quae fecerunt, eadem patiantur and ipsi.
It is very just if men suffer the same things of others which they have done
to others. If any man object, that by Lex Talionis.
Christ in the fifth of Matthew this law is repealed, or was disliked: we
answer, neither; but there our Savior condemns the abuse of this law
according to private affections, and for the nourishing of a lust to revenge by
private persons that are not Magistrates, and never would be entreated to
forgive any. Whereas he likes ever in his children mercy, and kindness, and
patience, and so to overcome our enemies as his words show, Recompense not
evil for evil, but overcome evil with goodness.

8 The other laws that follow in this Chapter of setting servants free, for
hurts done them by smiting. Of ver. 26. 27.
the Ox that should gore any body, Of digging a well whereby my neighbors
cattle receive harm falling into Quod de Boue hic and in sequentibus dicitur,
proportionabiliter de quibuscunque alijs animantibus intelligendum esse, docet
Augustinus q. 81. and 82. in Exodus
it, Of harm by one beast done to an other, and such like: they are so easy
yt without any Commentary, you may by reading of them be satisfied. All of
them teach us, with that care we should live of our Neighbors goods as well as
of our own, no way hurting either the one or the other, small or great, free
or bond, but peaceably spending our days with all men, and doing what good we
can any way. God we see is just, and we should be just. God cares for the
safety and well being not only of all sorts of Men, but even of the very
brute beasts; and we must learn to do the like, that by our resembling of him,
we may be known to be his Children, one day to inherit with his dear Son
in his eternal kingdom. This will not such cursed courses, as many men
delight in, bring them to, who in oppressing their neighbors, in hurting their
servants, in spoiling men's goods, and killing their Cattle, in fightings, and
striuings, and all evil, take their great and daily pleasure. Who has ears
to hear Mat. 11. 15.
shall hear, and to others do what we can, the word of God shall be a Savor
of death unto death in Gods justice. 2. Cor. 2. 16.
And thus much shall suffice of this Chapter.

CHAP. 22.
THe Lord goeth-on with more laws, all tending to the explanation of the ten
commandments: and in this Chapter very excellent laws, are laid down:
which how soever they are not in use among us, yet yield this good by the
reading and marking of them. To teach us privately in our selves an honest,
good, and holy carriage of our selves. Princes may alter laws, as circumstances
of times and place shall require; but the equity that God had in these laws
ever remains. And therefore what he punished we must avoid, if we do well.

First, he begins with laws against theft, which Ver. 1.
must be referred to that Commandment: and according to several degrees and
differences of theft, he makes several and differing pains. If a man steal
an Quinque vtilitates Bouis. Pascit, arat vitulus, triturat, no, calciat, armat.
Ox or a Quatuor Ouis. Lactat, pascit, Vestit, immolatur. Hugo.
Sheep, and kill it or sell it, he shall restore five Oxen for the Ox, and
four Sheep for the sheep. The greater theft has the greater punishment.
Other Nations, by the light of God set in them, followed much this course and
punished theft diversely. Draco punished it with death. Solon (if it were
manifest) with four fold; if not so manifest, with double Romani furtum
manifestu^ quadruplo, non manifestum duplo puniebant.
The Romans 12. Tables did the like. Latter laws with us, make theft death, if
above such a value: following therein a constitution of Lotha^^us the Emperor,
whose sum was above five shillings.

An other case concerning theft, follows in the second and third verses. If a
Thief be found breaking up a house, Ver. 2.
and be smitten that he dye, no blood shall be shed for him (his meaning is,
if this be in the night:) But if it be in the day light, blood shall be shed
for him: Ver. 3.
for he should make full restitution: if he had not wherewith, then should
he be sold for his thest. The law therefore appointing that punishment, he
should not be killed that brake a house in the day. The Romans twelve Tables
followed this equity, and in the night these breakers might be killed any
way: But in the day not, except he defended himself by a weapon. Our own
laws have made a difference betwixt day-thieues, and night-thieues, as indeed
there is much cause to distinguishe them; the fear in the night being far
greater, and the help to be had far less, with many other circumstances.
But here may be a Question asked, what is lawful before God, these being but
civil constitutions? And answer may be made, what God permits surely is
lawful before him, and hurts not the censcience, if it be done as he
permits. But if our own affection, cruelty, and rage step in, being mere
private men, take heed, for we may do a thing lawful not lawfully. The Law
bids kill not, but if a man smite to drive a thief away, and death follow
without a killing mind, the case is altered: for there is inculpatatutela, as
Lawyers tell us, within the compass whereof I take this case to be:

An other law follows in the 4. verse, That if the theft were found with him,
alive, he restored double: if killed Ver. 4.
or sold, you saw in the first verse an other punishment more heavy. So must
circumstances direct Judges to several punishments: and the wisdom of God
make man wise in all his proceedings. They that think death too much, must
remember yt even Gods law made the stealth of man death, And David said, he
that had taken the poor 2. Sam. 12. 5.
man's one sheep should surely dye. Draco made it death, as you heard before:
and the Romans decreed, that stealing Cato: Fures priuatos in nexu and
compedibus viuere, publicos in auro et purpura.
servants, should first be beaten, and then thrown down from a Rock, and
slain. But I pray you, would these men that thus plead for the continuance of
this law of Moses, That Thieues should restore and not dye, be as well content
that other laws should stand in force also, as namely, That adultery should be
punished with death? gathering but sticks on the Sabbath day, with death, etc?
No I warrant you. And therefore what they think, is not a Rule, but what God
allows, whose will is ever justice it self, and who by his Apostle has
taught, That so long as laws have this end to be a terror to the evil, and a
defense to the good, ye form of them may be diverse: Neither now a days is all
theft death, but the Judge weighs circumstances of need for sustinance only,
of the first offense, of repentance, of youth, of towardliness, and such like.

2. After theft, follow laws for damages or trespasses done to our Neighbors:
and the Text says, If a man hurt a Ver. 5.
field or a Vineyard, and put in his beasts to feed in an other man's field, he
shall recompense of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
Vineyard. And if fire break Ver. 6.
out, and catch in the thorns, and stackes of corn, or the standing corn, or
the field be consumed, he that kindled the fire, shall make full restitution.
Who knows not, that the society of man cannot continue without recompense of
losses and harms? Therefore mercifully does God regard it and make laws for
it. Euripides makes Iocasta speak of this equity, when he gives her these
words, Melius est equalitatem colere, quae amicos amicis, vrbes vrbibus, socios
socijs deuincit etc. Better it is to regard equality, which binds friends to
friends, Cities to Cities and fellows to fellows, etc. Now equality is, if I
have hurt any man, to make amends that no man be pulled in his estate.

3. Concerning pledges, borrowing, lending, etc. If Ver. 7.
a man deliver his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out or
his house, if the thief be found, See the 8 Commandment of these matters
more. Ver. 8.
he shall pay the double, If the Thief be not found, then the master of
the house shall be brought to the Judges to swear, whether he has put his hand
to his neighbors goods or no? That is, whether himself has stolen it or no
etc? unto the 16. verse. In all Nations, faithfulness and truth in matters
committed to trust has been highly regarded, and the contrary punished.
Therefore even with Heathens, beside recompense imposed, he was infamous that
offended this way, which how great a punishment it was, they see that rightly
consider it. The Lawyers called it a civil death, because it leaves to a man
no Ciuiliter mortuis.
honest place among men in the commo^-wealth, he being disabled to sue for any
thing, to give any voice, to be any witness, or to be of any credit any way.
There is too much iniquity amongst men in these matters, and therefore to be
wished greatly, that these laws of God were often read and marked. Truth in
trust is a jewel of price pleasing to God and man, and mest honorable ever to
the party alive and dead. Let Christians of all other men so think, that the
ways of God be not ill spoken of for their faults, such men had better never
have been borne, than without care so to sin. Now go we a little farther
than this law expressly goes, and judge in our own heart, if falsehood in
pledges committed to me by man be thus odious, is not unfaithfulness in Gods
pledge much more odieus? Remember ye place to Timothy, Custodi depositum: That
worthy 2. Tim. 1. 14.
thing which was committed to thee, keep through the holy ghost which dwells
in us. What worthy pledge is this but the pure and holy doctrine of ye word,
which I must never mingle with man's traditions? The manner of teaching it, if I
be a Teacher, must be plain, profitable, and to the most edification, not to
the greatest ostentation. Be faithful in these things therefore, for they are
pledges lest with us by God, which he will ask for again, and require an
account what we have done with them etc.

4 For wanton and licentious life the Lord provides saying, If a man entice a
maid that is not betrothed and lie with Verse. 16.
her, he shall endow her and take her to wife. But if her father refuse to give
her to him, he shall pay money, according Verse. 17.
to the dowry of virgins. Where you may observe the severity of God and the
remisnes of man in punishing matters of this kind. For man made his law
disjunctive, he shall marry her, or give her dowry: But God makes a
copulative, Aut. Et.
he shall marry her and give her dowry, yet leaving free ye fathers
authority, whether he would so bestow her or no. If the father would bestow
her, then both must he marry her and endowe her, because he had thus offended
with her. So God ever regarded parents consents in the placing of their
children. Yea Nature it self saw this equity in Hermione ye maid in
Euripides, who answered Orestes ye sought her to wife; that the marriage of her
belonged to her father. (...).
He that will, may read S. Ambrose upon the story of Rebecca, and see his
judgment of this thing. But why was not the maid punished also, as well as ye
man? partly because years and sex and weakness of judgment might be occasion
of fall in her, but chiefly because such money imposed upon her, must have come
from the parents, who were innocent, and had grief enough by the fall of their
child. Furthermore, this is to be remembered here, that if ye parents would
bestow her, never might he that had abused her, put her away by bill of divorce
as other might. The Romans did not enforce marriage, because the man might be
noble and the woman mean; or contrariwise, the woman noble and the man mean.
Whereas the Israelites were all alike noble descended from one and the same
house, and the pedigree known, but i^ he were rich, he lost half of his
goods, and if worth little, his body was punished and he banished, which was
sharper.

5 Of witches, your Chapter says, Thou shall not suffer a witch to live, which
God would never have laid down, if Ver. 18.
either there had been no wi^ches, or being yet they can do nothing, as some
have to their blame affirmed. The shifts they use to avoid this place are
weak, and by the best learned rejected. God makes no law in vain, but for
more of this matter, I refer you to the Commandment. In this place, says One,
God joins this law next after that of enticing young women, because many
times these witches are iustruments to work them to men's sinful desires. The
next law, against unnatural lusts with Beasts, I pass over, the fact being
more filthy than to be spoken of. Death Ver. 1^. Aug. l. 3. Co^fes. cap. 8.
Flagitia quae sunt contra naturam, apud omnes gentes det^st and a sunt, qualia
Sodomitarum fuerunt; Violatur enim talibus flagitijs societas illa, quae cu^
Deo nobis est. ver. 20.
it was by law, and death eternal follows the temporal. God and Nature
abhor it, and he tastes neither of God nor Nature that commits it. The
eyes of God see all things, and the Justice of God will find out all things in
time.

6 He that offers to any Gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be slain. The
like law you read in Deuteronomy. If there be found amongst you in any of thy Cities
which the Lord thy God gives, the man or woman that has wrought wickedness
in the sight of the Lord thy God in transgressing his covenants, and has gone
and served other Gods and worshipped them, as the Sun or the Moon, or any of
the host of heaven which I have not commanded, and if it be told thee, and so
forth, then stone that person to death, etc. In the 13. Chapter the like death
is Deuteronomy. 13. 6. 9. 10.
imposed upon those that shall persuade and draw to this sin. So both worker
and willer suffered death. And indeed should thieves dye for robbing man, and
not man dye for robbing God? Can man's goods be compared with Gods honor? No, no.
Again if we smeare fealty to the Prince his enemy, Dye we not worthily? To
swear fealty to the Devil by Idolatry is worse to God than that to man.
Happy were deceived creatures, if any thing would make them wise, and bring
them back again to God only, only, and mark the word.

strangers in Egypt. Ye shall not ver. 21. ver. 22.
trouble any widow nor fatherless child. For if thou vex or trouble such,
and so he call and cry unto me, I ver. 23. ver. 24.
will surclie hear his cry. Then shall my wrath be kindled, and I will kill
you with the sword, and your wives shall be widows, and your children
fatherless. Our state in this world is not tied to any place, but God at his
pleasure may remove us even when we think least, therefore the Lord would
have them then, and all men still favorable to strangers. Experiences of evil
past and expectances of future, if God so please to have it, must make men
forbear Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco.
those discourtesies to strangers, yt otherwise man's corruption will offer. By
the law of Nations it was ever forbidden and sharply punished to violate the
trust that a poor stranger has in us, when he lives with us and under us.
The Athenians were good, the Lacedaemonians were bad, and so praised, and
dispraised in Books to this day. The next Chapter verse 9. teaches this
matter again, and often is it beaten upon by God, that they may remember it.
Hippias in Plato says By Nature every like Simile, Natura, cognatum est simili.
is cozen to his like, and surely it is a great knot among men, likeness
either of wit, manners, judgment, or fortune, etc. Which Plutarch also
witnesses when he says, Plut. lib. de discrimine amici ^t adulatoris.
Senis lingua suanissima est seni, puer puero, mulier mulieri iucunda est. Et
aegrotus afficitur calamitate aegrotantis, and aru^nosus socio calamitatum suam
sententiam a scribit. The speech of an old man pleases an other old man, a
child conte^teth a child, and a woman a woman. One sick body feels the
pain of an other, and pittieth it. So do fellows in affliction talk together
and express each to other their minds. Wherefore God uses for his reason
here, that they also have been Strangers in Egypt. It pleases the good Spirit
of God to use this comfort to his Church, touching Christ, if you remember:
That we Heb. 4. 15.
have not a high Priest, which cannot be touched with the feelings of our
infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without sin. And
thereupon concludes, Let us therefore go boldly unto the throne of grace, 16.
that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. If we
be not in ability to do Strangers any good, yet comfortable words shall please
both them, and God that made this law for them.

The other law concerning Widows, and fatherless Orphans, Ver. 22. Mortuis
et iace^tibus omnia insul ta^t. Sophocles.
as the Lord made it in great mercy, so will he ever punish ye breaches with
sharp justice. Affliction, says Solomon, is not to be added to the afflicted.
Widows and fatherless children therefore must be pitied, and comforted, and
helped if need require, seeing they have lost their head; and not oppressed
and wronged, vexed and grieved, as often they are. Now, that ye Lord will
punish, you see the Text plain, and how? (O read it again, for it is
fearful) with the Ver. 24.
sword will he destroy those wringers and crushers, that their wives also may
become widows, and their children fatherless. So verifying ye wise Saying. By
what a man Christ had a care of his mother at his death. Job. 31. 16.
sins, by that shall he be punished. Careful therefore was Job to avoid this
danger, and voweth vehemently that he never restrained the poor of their
desire, nor caused the eyes of the widow to fail, by long waiting for her
request. Let this, move us, and strike us, and ever profit us.

If thou lend money to my people, that is, to the poor Ver. 25. Vsuraius super
omnes mercatores maledictus. Chrysostom. hom. 38. super Mat. Amb. li. de David.
Et esca Vsura est, et vestis Vsura est, et quodcunque sorti accedit, quod velis
ei nomen imponas, Vsura est.
with thee, thou shall not be as an Usurer unto him, ye shall not oppress him
with usury. This matter of usury is so largely handled by many, and so little
regarded by more, that I spare my labor in it. To allow all that some allow, or
to condemn as much as * some condemn, as yet I see no reason. Many are the
cases, and intricate are the questions moved and mentioned in this matter.
Orphans are left with nothing to bring them up, but a portion of money, some
in the Universities, some in the Country. Spend the stock and it will soon be
gone; use it, and occupy it themselves they cannot. So they have money and want
a trade, others have trades, and want money. Bucer in Cambridge was asked this
question, and did not dislike In King Edward the 6. days.
of some interchange profitable to the Orphane; and yet not opening the way to
flat usury. Stran gers likewise and exiles out of their country for religion
and good causes, bring a little money with them for easines of carriage, and
nothing else, themselves happily may not trade in a foreign land; how then
shall they, their wives, and children live? workmen peradventure also they are
not, but of an higher degree. In short therefore, we know the end of the
commandment is love: so far the^, as borrowing 1. Tim. 1. 5.
and lending breaks not that, but agrees with it, moderate men may do what
is fit for them, and no scope given to ye condemned usurer. To meet with one
inconvenience, and to bring many others into the commonwealth, was never
wisdom. Wherefore let every man search his own heart, and well observe his
own dealings, in lending to his neighbor that lives with him, as knowing
that nothing is hid from God, but must be accounted for one day. If co^tracts
and charity agree not together, but what profits you, hurts your
neighbor, ye case is altered I speak of, and what (agreeing with love) is by
learned men allowed, the same disagreeing from the same, is condemned and
blamed.

9 The next law is concerning pawnes and pawne-takers. A great trade still in
this wringing world. And of them thus the Lord speaks. If thou take thy
neighbors Ver. 26.
raiment to pledge, thou shall restore it to him before the Sun go down: for
that is his covering only, and this is 27.
his garment for his skin, wherein shall he sleep? Therefore when he cries
unto me, I will hear him: For I am merciful. The 24. of Deutro. is to be
referred hither, for explication further of ye mercy that God requires in
this matter from all men. Mark it and ever remember it, ye nakedness and
misery of the poor body cries against thee to ye Lord, and he has vowed to
hear. All is not gained then that is put in thy purse, but only that which is
well put in.

The other laws of reverence to Magistrates, neither reuiling Ver. 28. etc.
them, nor thinking lightly of them, of due and true paying of tithes to the
maintenance of Gods truth and Ministers and so forth, will come hereafter to be
touched again, and therefore no more now of this Chap.

CHAP. 23.
THis Chapter also as has been said, Ver. 1.
goes on with mo Laws, tending likewise to the exposition of the Moral Law,
and namely, of the 8. and 9. Commandments.

Touching the proceeding with more laws, we may make use of these and the like
Sayings. Arcesilaus in Laertius did not like that there should be many laws,
saying. Quemadmodum vbi multi medici, ibi multi morbi: it a vbi permultae
lege^, ibi plus vitiorum. Like as where there are many Physicians, that are
many diseases: so where there are very many laws there are more faults. Demonax
very unadvisedly spoke against all laws saying. Leges prorsus esse mutiles, Vt
quibus boni non egerent, mali nihilo fierent meliores. That laws were
altogether unprofitable, because the good needed them not, the bad would not be
bettered by them. But Chrysostom with a better spirit, both approved
goodlaws, and would have the^ ALL to be obeyed, Saying. In citharanon satis
esse, in vno tantum neru^, concentum efficere, Vniuersos oportere percuti and
numerose and decenter: ita ad salutem, non satis esse vnam Legem, vniuersas
esse audiendas and seruandas. To make music on a Harp, it is not sufficient
to play on one sting, but all must be stricken in due measure and proportion:
so to salvation one Law is not sufficient, but all must be well understood and
duly kept. These laws therefore here following continued by God himself, and
serving by explanation to help our understanding, and consequently to direct
our practice, concerning former laws, are dillgently by us to be observed.

In the two first verses, observe the virtues of a good and upright judge, and
add them to that which was spoken in the 18. Chap. His first virtue is Truth,
Truth, (I say) in his sentence and judgment, which he must ever carefully
labor for by all good ways and means. Contrary to truth are false tales and
rumors which therefore here in the first words are forbidden either to be
received of ye Judge, or reported by others. Thou shall not receive a false
tale, neither shall thou put thy hand with the wicked, to be a false witness.
The Word signifies both to receive and report, therefore both forbidden. That
the Judge may thus do, he must ever remember Epicharmus his little saying,
Meme^to diffidere, Remember to distrust, or be not too credulous; which Cicero
so commends and likes, that he doubts not to call it the synews and ioints
of all humane Wisdom. It has place in all our private life and actions, but
especially in judgment. This cannot he do, unless he have an other virtue
included in this, namely, (...)
Non prius feras sententiam, quam vtriusque partis causam cognoueris.
diligence to hear both sides, patiently, fully, and indifferently, which
ever good Judges do: for want whereof, how fowlie some have been carried awrie,
many Stories testify. That one let me remember of Apelles the Ephesian, who
was accused to Ptolemie by his enemy Antiphilus, that he had imparted to one
Theodorus treasonable conspiracies and plots against the King, which Theodorus,
in truth Apelles had nener seen in his life. The King lightly and hastily
gave credit to this tale, and clapped Apelles up with full purpose to execute him
for it. And indeed had so done, if a prisoner in the same prison moved in
conscience, had not opened the whole truth and acquainted Apelles: which when
the King saw he perceived also his great fault in crediting too lightly, and
gave that accuser to Apelles, to do with him what he would, or, as some write,
to be his Bondsman for ever. Judges, therefore, must beware of this great fault,
and hear ever the defense of the accused. Now because we be not al Judges,
does not this law concern us? yes, yes, your own heart can tell you, if they
must not receive them, we must not tell them, raise them, and coin them. If we
do, the Lord sees it and marketh it; and although they wisely avoid the snare
of them, and set free the accused and slaundered; Rumor est sermo sine authore,
cui malitiaded it initium, credulitas incrementum, and deus tantu^ finem.
yet God remains a swift Judge and very sure to consume such wretches, who
so against his law have wrought evil against their neighbor and brother. If
we may not rashly smite and kill with the hand, although he be a thief, no more
with the tongue although it be true, for charity hides a multitude of faults.
The phrase moves Fama malum, quo non aliud velocius vllum.
me, and therefore I note it, that (if God so please) it may move you also.
Thou shall not put thy hand with the wicked, to be a false or cruel witness.
If to give the hearing be in some measure to put to the hand, surely to have an
itching ear to hear evil reports of our Christian brethren, with delight and
contentment to believe them wholly or half, and to report the^ again, is to put
to the hand much more, and to be grievously guilty before God. Yet what so
common in our mouths, as, I am not the author, I am not the first rayser, I
heard it, I have my author, and so forth? God that made this law against
receiving knows, hearing goes before receiving, and if not receive, then not
hear, not believe, not report to others. For he shall be thy Judge, who will
not be mocked with shifts. How many men satisfy their own consciences herein,
I know not, when they hear with greedines, and have their instruments laid
abroad for that purpose, never imparting to the party what they hear, that he
may answer it, but keeping all close from him, and thinking what they please.
I know there may be some reason to conceal the accuser, but to conceal the
accusasion, I know none. For if they will hear with one ear, let them hear
with the other Pro. vt aquilo Pluuias.
in the name of God, the wrong side being as broad as the right; and after two
or three accusations cleared, they will better know both the accuser and
accused to their own good. Would God this fault were not where it least should
be, and where the sin of it is as well known, as others feel the injury.
Till it be amended, let the child of God say with David, O God of my
righteousness: Psalm. 4. 1. Psalm. 135. 24.
and again, God thou know mine innocence, and my faults are not hid from
thee. To thee, therefore I fly, as knowing all both my good and my bad, and in
thy knowledge I rest, be it unto me as thou will. I know thou have means to
humble David, and what thou do shall be ever good in the end. After a cloud
the sun breaks forth, and the weather clears and is more comfortable.

2 After Truth and diligence to attain to it by hearing both sides, the Lord
also requires in a good Judge, Skilfulnesse in the law, and Constancy: saying
in the next verse: Thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil, neither agree
in a controversy to decline after many, and overthrow Verse. 2.
the truth. Skilfulnesse in law to give a right sentence, not fitting the line
to the stone, but the stone to the line. The line is fitted in the stone, when
the multitude is followed to do evil, than the which multitude nothing is
more mutable and uncertain. The stone is fitted to the line, when sentence is
given according to law and truth, that the Judge having his name of Justice,
his name and his actions must agree. Constancy stays the Judge skillful to
discern right, and to do what he discerns, (...) inquit. Plato.
notwithstanding any company gainsaying it, and therefore is Constancy also
required in him. Now if this may not be done in civil matters, whose heart will
not tell him, much less may it be done in religion, and matters of Verse. 2.
August. in Psalm. 19. Multitudo non sequenda. Lib. 1. de Ciuitate Dei. Vulgi
iudicium errore plenum.
faith. The words are plain. Thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil,
therefore a multitude may err and do evil. Neither decline after many to
ouer-throw truth, therefore a multitude may overthrow truth. And how then can
it be a rule to guide my conscience by, either in civil or ecclesiastical
matters? O weigh it well and with a religious heart, and let neither popery
tell you of multitude, nor Anabaptists of fewnes and paucitie, but ever look
you for truth, be they many or few, and let that be the issue. For proof,
there is too much to be recited now, that many may err, and many hold truth,
therefore neither the one number, nor the other any rule to a Christian
conscience.

3 The next virtue in a Judge is equality, which is opposed Comic. Iudices
s(...) ad(...)nt diuiti propt^r (...)idiam, and addunt paupe^^ propter
misericordiam. Iudiciu^ inflecti non debet propter lachrymas cuiusque. Non enim
(...) i^^ra mis^ricordia est. 23. q. 4 Can. 35.
to respect of persons. Equality gives like unto like according to one rule
certain, from which there must be no departing a hairs breadth, for any
qualities in men, as wealth or poverty, and such like. On the contrary part,
respect of persons gives to like unlike, to like causes unlike and differing
judgments, for qualities in the party, corruptly carrying the Judge his
affections. As Alexander the Great more respected Ephestio nothing so well
deserving, than Craterus a valiant Gentleman, and right well deserving of the
commonwealth. This equality, and indifferency God requires, that it may
express his nature upright and indifferent to all men, either in accusing them
by his law, or saving them upon repentance by his Gospel, in neither of
which, he respects any man's person. Which, as it is a just terror if we do
evil, how great soever we be: so is it as just a comfort, if we turn from
it, be we never so small, poor, wretched, vile and miserable. Remember Saint
Peter's words in the tenth Chapter of the Acts. If Judges will be free from
respect of persons, then needs must they be free from gifts, for gifts will
lead their affections will they nill they, the old saying being true,
Beneficium accepisti? libertatem amisisti. Have thou received a gift? then have
thou lost thy liberty and freedom: All this is contained in the words ot the
text. Thou shall not esteem a poor man in his cause. And if al Judges
followed this course, Hesiodus should not need to feign, that Astraea has
left the society Verse. 3. 6. etc. 7. 8.
of men and is flowen up to heaven. But it is to be feared, that as Ulisses
servants, when he was asleep, opened a bottle which Aeolus had given him,
wherein the winds were all enclosed, and so let the winds out, they thinking
there was treasure in the bottle, which as well at sea, as at land they loved:
so some Judges opening men's purses Read Deutro. 17. Chap.
whilst they look for gain, let truth escape from them to their own hurt,
and the Commonwealths. If any do so, God make his word profitable to them,
and so I leave them to him.

4 It follows in the text. If thou see thine enemies Verse. 4.
Ox or his Ass going astray, thou shall bring him to him again. If thou see
thine enemies Ass lying under his 5.
burden, will thou cease to help him? thou shall help him up again with it.
Let us here remember that Gods actions are after two sorts, general, and
particular. General to all men, Particular to his friends: So must ours be,
taking our president from him. As therefore by his general Action he suffers
his Sun to shine upon the bad, Mat. 5 45.
as well as upon the good, and such like: so must we extend our love, which is
the common bond of mankind, as well to our enemies, as to our friends. By
which common love, all hurting of the bodies, or goods, wives, or children of
our enemies, without just and necessary cause is forbidden, and contrariwise
the law of nature to be observed. Quod tibi non nocet, and alteri prodest
praestandum. What hurts not thee, and profits an other is to be performed.
From which fountain of this general love spring many laws, and by name this
bringing back our enemies straying Ox, and helping up his oppressed beast.
That also, Deuteronomy. 20. 19.
which you read in Deuteronomie, of not destroying the fruit trees in the
enemies ground, which they did besiege, because there is use of such trees.
Again, as God has his special action to his friends and to his Church,
namely Sanctification: so must friendship, which is our special Gal. 6 10.
Action, reach it self but to such, as are of the householde of faith, and our
friends. For although we must love with that general love all mankind,
Turks, Pagans, etc. Yet to such may we not be friends and familiars, but must
beware inward and usual conversation with them that hate God, and all his
graces. Both these are contained in that rule of Christ, Be simple as Doves,
and Mat. 10. 16.
wise as Serpents: for by the Doves simplicity is meant, we should learn to
hurt no body, but, as near as we can; be helpful to all; and by the
Serpents wisdom that we should yet know to put a difference betwixt the
household of faith and Gods enemies, betwirt the religious and profane, betwixt
the godly and the wicked. By this distinction, Iere. 15. 19.
you may see better the meaning of that Scripture, Love your enemies.
Concerning this helping up of Mat. 5. 44.
our enemies beast, under his burden, fallen, I pray you Verse. 5.
mark, if the margent of your Bible note it not well. That, if God command us
to help our enemies Ass under his burden, will he ever suffer us to throw
down our brethren with heavy burdens? It reaches to many things wherein is
hard dealing, if you think of them.

Thou shall not overthrow the right of thy poor in Verse. 6.
his suite. Before verse. 3. he commanded that a poor man should not be spared
for pity: Here now he enioyneth, that a poor man should not be wronged in
respect of his poverty: such equal steps would God have Judgment to walk
in.

Thou shall take no gift: for the gift blinds the wise, and peruerteth the
words of the righteous. The equity of this law, was seen by the dim eye of
Nature, for Verse. 8.
the Romans (as appears by the laws of their twelve Tables) Used to punish
that Judge with death, which was convicted to take a Bribe for giving
judgment. Dioclesian Lex. 12. Tabul.
the Emperor likewise enacted, Sententiam a iudice corrupto prolatam, fore
ipso iure infirmam sine prouocatione. That a sentence given by a bribed Judge,
should by the law be of no validity, without any farther appeal. Now
corruption and gifts (as One says) are not only, Money, Gold, Silver, and
Presents: Sed etiam propter laudem qui iudicat ^ale, munus accipit, and munus
Greg. Moral. 9. cap 26. Tres sunt acceptione muneru^: Munus a cord, est
captata gratia a cogitatione: munus ab ore, est gloria per fauorem: munus ex
manu, est praemium per dationem.
quo nihil (...)anius: But he also which judges wrongfully to get PRAISE
thereby, receives a GIFT, and a GIFT than which, there is nothing more vain:
Patuit enim illi auris ad accipiendu^ iudicium linguae alienae, and perdidit
iudicium conscientiae suae: For his ear has been open to receive the
flattering verdict of another man's tongue, and he has lost the comfortable
testimony of his own conscience. Innocentius reprooueth corrupt Judges with
these words: Vos non attendit is merit acausarum sed personaru^, non iura sed
munera, non quod ratio dictet sed quod voluntas affectet, non quod liceat sed
quod lubeat: Nunquam enim vobis est tam simplex oculus, vt totum corpus sit
lucidum: Pauperum causam cum mora negligitis, Diuitum causam cum instantia
promouetis, etc. Aliquid semper admittitis fermenti quototam massam
corrumpitis. In giving judgment, YOU respect not the worth of the causes but
of the person, not the laws but gifts, not what reason does counsel but what
the will does affect, not that which is lawful in it self, but that which is
pleasing to your selves: For your eye is never so single that the whole body
might be light: Poor men's causes with prolonging delay you neglect, rich men's
causes with instant earnestnes you set forward, etc. You always mingle some
leaven which corrupts the whole lump.

5 The law of mercy to strangers verse. 9. has been touched Verse. 9.
before, and therefore observe next, this law of Rest to the ground, the 7.
year for the relief and comfort of the poor. Six years shall thou sow thy
land, and gather the fruits of Verse. 10.
it, the 7. year thou shall let it rest and lie still that the poor of thy
people may eat, and what they leave, the beasts of 11
the field shall eat. In like manner thou shall do with thy vineyard, and with
thy olive trees: with great profit we may note and see this gracious care which
the Lord our God has over all his creatures, and learn, as our power and
places give us leave, to follow his example. To the poor now in the land you
see his love, and you read his law here with your eyes. Why should it not work
a good effect in your heart during your life in this matter? First, it is his
will we should with hand show our heart both to him, and to our poor and
needy brethren, and without deeds vain are our words that we love one
another, Secondly, his recompense is great in them that do it, and never
fails. Whosoever gives but a cup of cold water, shall not loose his reward.
Come ye blessed of my father, and possess Math. 10. 42. Mat. 25 34. 35
eternal comfort. For when I was hungry you fed Me, and so forth. Me, I
say, in the poor with you, to whom what you did, you did it to Me, and so I
take it. Blessed Psalm. 41. 1.
is the man that provides for the poor and needy, the Lord shall deliver him
in all his trouble. By examples might this be proved, but it needs not,
only remember in the widow of Sarephath, what followed her 1. King. 17.
piety in feeding the Prophet, when she had not much for her self. It is a
Story in stead of a thousand to raise up our hearts in this matter.

6 The three feasts here mentioned, to wit, Easter, Ver. 14. etc.
Whitsontide, and Tabernacles, will have an other place hereafter, unto which I
will refer the treatise of them. Of the rest of this Chapter spent in ye
promises of god unto their obedience, I will only say this: that these great
and sweet promises are as honey, till we think of the Condidion, to wit,
perfect obedience, but then we fall from all hope, had we not a Christ, because
such perfect obedience to the law we cannot perform. Christ therefore we fly
to, and rely upon him, who having performed that obedience Verse. 19.
Domitianus, apud Suctonium, mescas necat and crudelis etc. Athenis damnatur
puer iudicum sententia, quod cornicum eculos confixisset.
for us, now justifies us by faith in him without that condition, and makes
his righteousness our righteousness by imputation. Thou shall not sees a Kid
in his mothers milk. As Cruelty is here forbidden by God: so was it condemned
by the very Pagans.

CHAP. 24.
IN this Chapter, first note how Moses alone ascends up to God, and let it
remember us that there are differences of graces, and yet Verse. 1. 2 Nazianzen.
one spirit the giver of all. They that have more, may not despise them which
have less; neither they which have less, envy them which have more. Read the
1. Cor. 12. Chapter, etc. what if we say that the Law was fignified in Moses
going to God, because it is holy and just, but it brings not his company
with it, because they are imperfect keepers?

2 Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, etc. So is the
duty of a faithful Minister, still Verse. 3.
to receive of the Lord, and to deliver to his people what 1. Cor. 11. 23.
he has received, not any dregs or dross of man's invention, for in vain
do men worship him with men's precepts, etc. All the things which the Lord has
said, will we do. Concerning his rash and confident answer of the people,
note and remember the censure of learned men, that you may profit by it to a
warier kind of speaking out of a true feeling of your own and all men's
frailty of nature, by the corruption entered into us at our fall in our first
parents. Saint Hierome condemning such Chap 24. ver. 3 Hierony: in cap. 5
Ecclesiafles.
indiscreet hastines says. Melius est non promittere, quam promissanon facere:
and melius est ancipitem diu deliberari sententiam, quam in verbis esse
facilem, in operibus difficilem. It is better not to promise, tha^ not to keep
promise: and it is better for a doubtful thing to be long deliberated on, tha^
to grant it easily, and perform it hardly. Gregory again obersuing Greg.
Moral. 31. cap. 19.
this fault in the Jews, says, Iudaeoru^ populu^ locustae significabant
subitos saltus dantes, and protinus adterram sadentes: Saltus enim dabant, cu^
praecepta Domini se implere promitterent, ad terram cadebant, cum factis
denegarent. The people of the jews were signified by the Locustes which used
suddenly to leap up, and forth with to fall down to the earth again: They
did (as it were) leap up, when in words they promised to do all things which
the Lord had said, but they fell to the earth again, when in their deeds they
denied the same. Let us therefore (I say) always weigh our weakness, and
accordingly frame our promises, for (as we see in this people) we may purpose
well that, which we cannot so well perform.

3 Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, as a sure and safe way to keep them.
Tradition by word from man to man failed in faithfulness, and brought in many
errors under the name of Gods word and will. Therefore writing was devised by
God himself, and so his appointed instruments directed by him, have left unto
us his holy Scriptures. This matter has been largely entreated of by many.

blood, was a figure of the precious blood of the immaculate Lamb Christ
Jesus, with which we must be sprinkled to make us clean. The ninth Chapter to
the Hebrews will be an exposition to this place. The promise of the people
here again to obey a God in all things, testifies their heart, but not an
ability to do it. Therefore let us learn such affection, but gather no error
from such places of man's power to fulfill the same.

5 The Ascension of Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu with seventy of the Elders,
together with the vision, was a gracious confirmation of Moses his authoririe,
and of his law given. But we must know, that it was far from the Majesty of
God which they saw, no flesh being able to see him as he is, only a glimse for
their comfort he vouchsafed in such manner as the Text expresses.

6 After Moses ascends alone, yet so, that he leaves Aaron and Hur with
them, that whosoever had any matter Verse. 14.
might come to them, so watchful and faithful was Moses in his place, that
without just cause he is not absent, and then he leaves able Deputies. Such
care in Ministers now adays would God bless, and the contrary fault, as he
is God, he will severely punish.

7 Moses ascending is covered with a cloud, and not Verse. 16.
admitted to God till after six days, to teach all flesh patiently and
reverently to tarry Gods leisure and gracious pleasure, for any matter of his

thing we seek being fit for us. At the end of the six days, even the
seventh day God called unto Moses, and he is admitted to speech, and I pray you
mark how? covered with a cloud, for the Text says, He entered Verse, 18.
into the midst of the cloud, and went up to the Mountain. So will the Lord
have a comfortable time for all those that wait for him, and the knowledge of
him in his word. They shall see and hear at last, what he will say unto them.
For their hearts he will touch, their ears he will bore or open, and they
shall see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their
hearts to eternal life. But how? they must come to God in the Cloud, covered
with it, etc. that is, in the humanity of Christ, whereof this Cloud was a
figure. For without him there is no access to God, and by him we come and that
boldly. He is become flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone. Search without
him, and be oppressed of Majesty; search by him, and be comforted with mercy.
Kiss the Son and fear not. The sight of the glory of the Lord was like
consuming fire on the top of the mountain, in the eyes of ye children of
Israel (says your Chapter) but to them whom he drew to him, he appeared as a
pleasant Saphir, verse. 10. Certainly, even so to carnal men, and to such as are
his, called by his holy Spirit, there is a great difference of him; the one
seeing but fear and trembling, the other seeing, feeling, and tasting joy,
sweetness, comfort, and gladness, above that which man's pen can lay down, or his
narrow heart once conceive.

Lastly, Moses was in the Mount forty days and forty nights without meat or
drink, when as God could have dispatched him in a moment. All to give
authority to him and his law, as has been said, and that the people might
see in his long abstinence the divine power of God, and so ever esteem of the
thing wherein they saw no earthly course held. Let it teach us, still and ever
to reverence Gods ministers, to whom he has revealed his will for our good.
They are now his means, as then Moses was, and by his word he has graced
them, as here he did Moses by these miracles. He that hears you (says he)
hears me, and he that despises you, despises me. Thus much briefly of
this Chapter.

CHAP. 25.
GOds holy Spirit having, from the beginning of this Book unto the twenty
Chapter, laid down such things as went before the law, in the twenty Chapter
he entered to declare the laws, and first laid down the Moral law, the^ the
Judicial laws Chapters 21. 22. and 23. Now by a transition and way made
Chapter 24, in this 25. Chapter he begins with the Ceremonial laws, and so
continues unto the 31. Chapter. Which Ceremonial laws were either common and
touched all, whereof he speaks in this Book, or particular concerning only
the Levites, whereof in the next Book, called Leuiticus by reason of those
laws. In this Chapter first there is a preparation to the appointing of
Ceremonies, even unto the tenth verse, and then a prescription of them, thence
forward to the thirty Chapter. In the preparation you may note these heads.

1 A Commandment that the people should offer. 2 What they should offer? 3
With what heart and mind? 4 To what use and purpose? 5 To what use should the
Sanctuary serve? viz. that God might dwell there. 6 Of what fashion it should
be? viz. Like the pattern that Moses saw, etc.
1 The commandment to offer is expressed in these words, Then the Lord spoke
unto Moses saying, Speak Ver. 1.
unto the children of Israel, that they receive an offering for me of every
man, etc. The use and profit whereof to us 2
may be this. First, to observe, how although the Lord The first use.
have no need of any man's goods, whatsoever it is that we possess in this
world, because the whole earth is his and all that is in it; yet his pleasure
is sometimes to seek these things, and so to make men as it were his helpers
in such works as he will have done, that thereby he may even honor his
creature with a great favor, and take occasion upon our ready and willing
performance of what he seeks, to heap more and more favors upon us.
Remember with your self the 50. Psalm. I will take no Psalm. 50. 9.
Bullock out of thine house, nor Goats out of thy folds. For all the beasts
of the forest are mine, and 10
so are the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls upon the
mountains; and the wild beasts of 11
the field are in mysight. If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; for the whole
world is mine, and all that is therein. Remember the 16. Psalm. My goods are

good, and not for his need, which being well weighed, may make us more quick
and ready to give. As for example, could not he relieve a poor man himself,
or make of poor rich, all the honors in the world being disposed by him? yet
you see he will not, but sends him to you and others for a morsel of bread
and meat, that you being his instruments, he may take occasion to reward you.

his Sacraments, and all other offices of the Ministry to the salvation of our
souls, and all our children, servants, or neighbors that live with us, and
are by Almighty God committed to our charge. For as then they had grievously
sinned if they denied God an offering to that; so shall we, if we be wanting to

2 Touching the things to be offered, as Gold, Silver, Verse. 3. 4
brass, Blew silk, and purple, skarlet, fine linen, Goats hair, etc, thus
you profit by them. First, in the variety and the several kinds, you see
shadowed out unto you the difference of spiritual gifts and graces given by
God to men, for the building up of his spirtual Temple or Sanctuary in our
hearts, whereof remember the Apostles Romans 12. 6.
words in diverse places of his Epistles, as to the Romans, when he says:
Seeing then that we have gifts which are diverse, according to the grace which
is given unto us, whether we have prophecy, let us prophecy according to the
proportion of faith: Or an office, let us wait on 7
the office; or he that teaches, on teaching: Or he that exhorts, on
exhortation: he that distributeth, let him do it 8
with simplicity: he that rules, with diligence: he that shows mercy, with
cheerfulness. To the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 1e. 5 6
There are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit. And there are diversities
of administrations, but the same Lord; And there are diversities of operations,
but God is the same, that works all in all, etc. To the Ephesians again, He
Ephesians 4. 11.
therefore gave some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, and some
Pastros and Teachers, for the repairing 12
of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the 13
edification of the body of Christ, Till we all meet together (in the unity
of faith, and that acknowledging of the Son of God) unto a perfect man, and
unto the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ, etc. Thus some men are
endued with Gold, some with Silver, some with blew silk, some with purple, and
so forth, that is, with several gifts and graces, all profitable in some sort
for the building of the Sanctuary, and such as God has given, such must they
bring and offer, and such shall be accepted. For to this end also pleased it
God to appoint such several things, that poor and mean persons might be able
to offer, and no man exempted for want of power, ye very poorest being able to
offer goats hair, and that their mean gift to him was as welcome as the
greater gifts of the rich. To teach us at this day to despise in no man what
God himself accepts well, and despises not. For had they in those days
that were able to offer Gold, Silver, precious stones, blew silk and so
forth, disdained the poorer sort that brought Goats hair, Badgers skins, a
little Shittim wood and Pelles arietum et taxonu^ sieve melium, quoru^ pellis
pilis horrentibus pluuiam arcet. Plin. lib. 8. cap. 38.
such like, grievously would God have been displeased with it. And so assuredly
now, if any man, upon whom God has bestowed more, shall proudly scorn and
deride him that has less, ^et joining with his little to build Gods Sanctuary,
as well as he yt has much, God will see it, abhor it, and punish it. Away
then with all disdain and scorn in this matter, and humbly acknowledge, that
as some men want what thou have of Learning, Wisdom, Eloquence, and other
good gifts to build with all: so dooest thou want as much of others, who as
far excel thee, as thou in thine own opinion do excel others. O
hateful pride in this behalf, too much, too much in some that should be
wiser, and never since ye world was, more than now. We trudge from place to
place to feed our fancies, we choose, we judge, we censure, we shoot our
boltes in every corner, never remembering this and other places telling us of
the several powers of men, and GOD his good acceptance of the meanest. Let it
mend, and let it end before God end us and all this pride to our lasting pain.
Joy in them that bring any offering to this work, being the best they are
able, and know it as true as any thing is true, that the harmless
simplicity of some shepeheards in the old Church did sometimes more profit
the Church, than the great, exquisite, and fine, or delicate (but a little too
proud) Co^fess. Heluet.
learning of some others. A learned man of our time says very well: Every man
must walk in his place contentedly, Non omnes possumus esse Caesares. They yt
brought not gold nor silver, nor precious stones, yet did good Offices if they
brought but wood or stone. If we cannot attain to be In primis, to have the
first place, yet it is praise worthy if we may have the second, or the third.
In the building of the Temple after this Tabernacle, they that laid the
foundacions, nay, that dug places to lay the first stone in, that hewed and
squared the stone and the timber, were of less reputation and account, than
those that carved and gilded the Temple: yet was the others work and labor
far more necessary. They that till the land, and sow the seed, that thresh
and grind the corn, are of lower place than those that live in Princes
courts, yet is their labor and service far more needful. In man's body the
souereigntie is the head, the eyes and ears, as in place, so in dignity
excelling ye hands and feet: yet cannot the eye say to the hand, I have no
need of thee: nor the head again to the 1. Cor. 12. 21.
feet, I may be without you. The greater may not despise ye less, nor the
less murmr against ye greater etc. Here therefore Basils speech is good,
Attend tibi ipsi, Look to thy self. For every one has in his own house
accusatore^, testem, iudicem; an accuser, a witness, a Judge. Accusat te
conscientia, testis est memoria, ratio iudex. Look then to thy self, to thy
conscience, to thy memory, to thy reason, and thou shall censure thy self if
thou live not in thy place accordingly, without either envy of superior, or
contempt of inferior. Surgunt indoctiet coelum rapiunt, nos cum doctrinis
nostris in infernum detrudimur. The unlearned rise and get Heaven, says S.
Augustine, and we with our great learning are cast into Hell. Thus have good
men esteemed of their brethrens meaner gifts, and not despised them. They
offered their earerings and Iewelles, which were ornaments to them, and observe
their zeal, learning by it that nothing ought to be so dear unto us, which we
cannot find in our hearts to bestow willingly to the service and honor of
God. Qnaeprius luxui, iam Tabernaculo seruiunt. Those things, says One, that
served for superfluity before, now serve for Gods Tabernacle. Even so should
our bodies, that have been wanton and sinful, serving sin, serve the Lord
in his holy fear, and such humane learning as has served error, may be
applied to Religion and serve God etc, of which we spoke in the spoils of
Egypt.

3. But with what heart were these offerings to be made? The Lord also expressed
that, when he said: Whose heart gives it freely, v. 2. and in the 35. Chap. v.
5. Whosoever is Cap. 35. 5.
of a willing heart let him bring this offering to the Lord. Again v. 21. And
every one whose heart encouraged him or lifted him up, and every one whose
spirit made him willing. And v. 22. as many as were free hearted, etc. By all 22
which Repetitions, you see what an eye God has ever to the heart of one that
does any thing to him, yea although the thing it self be commanded, as here
such offerings were. Forced service God regards not, but will have ever our
will concur cheerfully, and hartelie. Wherefore in that Great offering of
David and the people toward the building of the Temple which Solomon built,
note it and mark it diligently what a mention is made of such a heart, as well
as of such and such gifts. The people reioiced when 1. Chron. 29. 9.
they offered willingly, for they offered willingly unto the Lord with a
perfect heart. Again, in (...) 17. v. O my God thou tryest, I know, the heart
and have pleasure in righteousness: I have offered willingly in the
uprightness of mine heart all these things: I have also found thy people which
are here, to have offered willingly with joy. The Apostle also witnesses, that
God loves a cheerful giver, and what is done grudgingly, that is, with a
sparing and 2. Cor. 9. 7.
nigardly heart, or of necessity, that is, against a man's will as loath to be
evil reported off; all that, be it whatsoever, ye Lord despises and regards
not: to which agrees that advise of the wise-son of Sirach, Give unto the most
High Eccles. 35. 10.
according as he has enriched thee, and look what thine hand is able, give
with a cheerful eye. With a cheerful 11
eye, I say again, and do you mark it. For the Lord reco^penceth, and will
give thee 7. times as much, meaning as thou give with such a cheereful eye.
Such a matter in all offerings, gifts, and duties to God is willingness,
cheerfulness, and hartinesse, making good that Saying of S. Augustine: Nemo
inuitus benefacit, etiamsi id quod bonum est Aug. co^fes. lib. (...). cap. 12.
facit. Even a good deed unwillingly done, is not well done. Were this
considered of people, that for fear of law or such like respects come to
Church and to the holy Communion without al conscience and love; of such as
cannot be drawn to give any thing to the poor, to reparatio^ of their Church,
to the Minister that preaches the Word of life unto them, and is in Gods stead
sent by him, and directed and enabled by him for their salvation, more than by
mere authority and strength of the law and the Magistrate they shall be forced
unto, surely it would work some better disposition in them I would hope, and
so draw from a gracious God reward upon willing duties, which now perish
without any profit to them from him, because they are altogether forced. He is
able to make it felt and considered.

4 The fourth point is, to what end these offerings Vt faciant MIHI
Sanctuarium, non idolis, non sibi, sed MIHI etc.
should be? even for a Sanctuary says the Text, that is, for a place to offer
Sacrifices in, and to hear the law in, as we now speak to make a Church.
For this Sanctuary was in stead of a Church unto them till Solomon built the
glorious Temple, The favorites of Rome often object to the Professors of the
Gospel, that we have no Churches built by any of our Religion etc. To whom
true answer is made, that first our bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghost,
and therefore were there no other Temples 1. Cor. 6. 19.
than these, yet God might dwell in us, and we be his. Secondly, this people
of the Jews, and our Forefathers 2454. years.
had no such Churches as now be, but worshipped ye true God in Tabernacles or
tents in the wilderness before this Sa^ctuarie was made, and then in this
Sanctuary, which was moveable also from place to place. Thirdly, Jesus Christ
in Math. 11.
ye Mountains, in Ships, and such like places taught the people, and they
heard his word and believed. John Baptist in the prison preached Christ, and
that was his Church. Paul did like, and begat disciples to Christ in his bands.
He preached Act. 28. 30. etc.
and taught two years together in his own house hired in Rome. Thereupo^ it
has bin said yt our Fathers (true godly men indeed) had dark Churches and
light hearts, afterward counterfeit Christians had shining Churches, and dark
Auentinus.
hearts. Men became like ye Disciples of Christ in that error of theirs, when
they so gazed upon, delighted in, and doted up o^ the outward form and matter
of ye Temple, coming to their Master to show him the building of the Temple,
Mat. 24. Mar. 13.
and saying to him, Master, see what manner stones, and what manner buildings
are here, how it was garnished with goodly stones, and with consecrate things.
To whom Christ answered: Are these the things that ye look upon? Luke. 21. 6.
As if he should have said, this is but lightness in you to eye so much these
things, for they are not the things that I most esteem: And therefore the time
will come, when not one stone shall be left upon an other, which shall not be
thrown down. Earthly temples and Churches have an use whilst God pleases,
but true Religion may be without them, and God rightly served if none were.
But now there are Churches in the World, and did the Papists build them all?
No, No, Assuredly the Jews, and the Gentiles did build most of them, and
their labors we inioye. Some peradventure were built, or repaired by men of
Romish Religion, Princes, Bishops, or others; but what said their great man
Campion preaching at ye nerall of Sir Thomas White? Surely (says he) this they
did (in maxima rerum vilitate, et multorum opibus adiuti) in a time of great
cheapenesse of every thing, and helped with the riches of many men. Thus could
he see and say before coffeehouse made him Popish, and blind Popery made
him blind also. Constantine the Great built Churches before ever Popery was
hatched. Charles the Great built Schools of divinity and Universities in
Germany, France, Italy, not for Popery, but for the Bible to be taught in,
and Saint Augustines works read at their tables. Edward the third King of
this Realm loved Wickleff, adorned the Universities, and speaking honorably
of the bounty of Princes blames and accuses Epist. ad Clementem. de
fu^dationibus, dotationibus, etc.
greatly the spoil and overthrow of Churches by Popes. The Britans
auntientinhabiters of this Nation, as Beda witnesses had their Churches and
Temples and yet no Popery. Therefore all was not done by papists. The vary
papists themselves confess the contrary. Churches then we have, and not
built by them, which yet if we had not, we might be Gods people. Worthy
person in our days which have built Colleges, enriched Cities with many such
other good works, would also have built Churches Till now no certain place,
and about 2^5^. years, as some do reckon. Verse. 9 Esaias. 66. 1. Acts. 17. 24.
if we had wanted, etc.

5 To what end would God have this Sanctuary builded? That I may dwell among
them says the Lord. He that has Heaven for his seat and earth for his
footestoole, dwells not in Sola in (...)atio Dei Templum Dei facit. Tho^. So
still because in our Churches the Word is preached, the Sacraments administered,
our prayers made and heard, therefore God also dwells in them according to his
promise, where two or three etc. Mat. 18. 20. My house shall be called the
house of prayer Matt. 21. 13. and he that swears by the gold of the Temple
swears by the Temple and by him that dwells in it. Mat. 23 21.
Temples made with hands, Neither is included in any place. But because there
he gave them visible signs of his gracious presence, and was not called upon
in vain, but with effect and profit to all men that rightly made their refuge
to him, therefore such mercy is called even dwelling among them. God is not
changed in these days, but still kind and comfortable to his people. And
therefore even our Temples also are his house in which he is truly worshipped,
and ever present to hear our true prayers, and to send us away with his
comfort as then he did. Which use and end of the Church is a matter of great
good to all minds that rightly and religiously will meditate of it, and be
instructed. For if it be his house, where he dwells and is present, if it be
the house of prayer and the worship of God, with what zeal and desire should
we go to it, with what reverence should we remain in it, and how unwillingly
depart from it before an end? What is for the decency of it: how cheerfully
should we give, and the wicked prophaners of it how severely should we punish?
The Prophet David being let by his persecutors, that he could not be present
in the congregation of Gods people, grievously complains for it, and
protests, that although he was separated in body from them, yet his heart
was with them, and that after a very earnest manner. For even as the Heart
desires the water brooks (says he) so Psalm. 42. 1 etc. Psa 26. Lord I have
loved the habitatio^ of thy house and the place where thine honor dwells.

David, how he swear unto 1 2 3 4

for the Temple of the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob etc.
Thus earnest to have a Temple, thus earnest to go the Temple, and thus grieved
to be from the Temple was this holy King and Prophet in whom Gods Spirit ruled.
Others also that have zealously loved to go to the Church, has God noted and
chronicled in his book, both for the encouragement of such as will do the
like, and for the just condemnation of all stubborn despisers of the same.

has caused his holy Evangelist to register this praise of her, that she went

not out of the Temple, but served GOD with fastings and prayers day and night.
It is said of old Father Simeon, Ver. 27.
that he came into the Temple by the MOTION OF THE SPIRIT when the parents
brought the babe Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law. Gods
spirit then moves men to ye Church, but never from ye Church. The Pharisie and
the Publica^ went both up into the Temple Luke. 18. 10.
to pray. And so good a thing as to go to the Church, God will not leave unnoted
and praised in a very Pharisie. The blessed Apostles Peter and John went up
together into Act. 3. 1.

yet they would go to the Church. Three times in the year, said the law of

albeit they dwelled a great way off. Where you may observe, that although ye
law reached but to ye males, because God graciously considered that ye women
might be with child, or nurses, and not able to come, yet godly women, when
they were able, and had no impediment, would go up also with their husbands,
such a zeal had they to the house of God where ye assembly met to serve God.
So went up Anna with her husband Elcanah, when she made unto her Son Samuel a

to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover, both of them when
there were gross and foul corruptions. For when Anna went up, what read you
of the Sons of Heli the Priest? And when Mary went up, Scribes and Pharisees
and wicked Priests were in their ruff. Yet they went up and many other godly
and well disposed, to teach us ever not to fall out with God for men's faults,
nor to absent our selves from Church, and Church exercises because all things
are not perfect in ye Ministers. O let men be men and full of miseries; let God
be God and full of mercy to regard and reward them ye so love him, and cleave
unto him, to his house, and to his service, as for no vices and faults of me^

in the midst of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions? To
teach it ever to the worlds end, that the place to seek Christ and find
Christ in, is ye Church: for in other places you may miss of him as his
Parents did, but never in the Church shall you fail if you seek him duly. It
is written of S. John, that when he was so old as he could not go to Church,
he would be carried by his scholars and friends to it. Chrisost. Quod apud te
precatus accipere non potes etc. That which praying privately thou can not
obtain, go to the Church and pray there for it, and thou shall obtain. The
prayers there made, says S. Hierom. are like a great thu^der-clap; yea like
the roaring of the sea says Basil. One stick makes a fire, but many sticks
a great and hot fire: One string gives a sound, but many strings a melodious
sound etc. I could not therefore refrain tears, says S. Austine, at Aug.

the hearing of the songs, which thy Church and congregation (met together) did
use to sing to thee, O Lord what time I first began to recover my Faith unto
thee, yea me think even yet still I feel my self ravished, not with the
singing, but with the sweet matterwhich is sung, etc. To the Church, to ye
Church then let our hearts be, ever following these blessed examples laid
before us, and know it well to be but a late devise of the Devil to uphold his
kingdom by secret persuading of people from the Church. There is nothing in
the Church but ye Scriptures of God, ye Sacraments of God, holy prayers, holy
and comfortable exhortatio^s to amendment of life drawn out of the Scriptures,
all in a tongue that we understand, instruction of our children and servants
for whom we must answer if by our negligence they be cast away, and in one
word, nothing yt may hurt or offend justly a religious mind. The contrary
speeches are slanders and shameless lies, as your self may see, if you will
make trial. Private houses and holes, woods and thickets, hay-mowes and barnes,
night and darkness may please them that love darkness, and walk in
darkness, but a good man, and a good woman will love light, and open
assemblies, will open both ear and heart to the truth, when God knocks, and
stand no more wilful against God, that so made them and bought them, and must
judge them. The next point Observe here also the sin of the prophaners of it.

is reverence and fit behavior in the Church, when we come there, because it
is Gods house where he dwells and is present. In the first of Luke it is said
that the whole multitude were without in prayer, while the incense was burning,
so reverently and religiously did they then use ye place. But alas, in our
days S. Chrysostom his complaint may Hom. 24. in Act.
be taken up. Alios videostare, et nugari dum preces fiunt, neque solum
dumpreces fiunt, sed et dum Sacerdos benedicit. Nescis quod cum Angelis stas?
cum illis cantas? cum illis Hymnos dicis? et stas ridens? Non mirum esset si
fulmen emitteretur non solum in eos, sed etiam in nos, dignaenim fulmine sunt
haec. I see others stand and trifle while prayer is said, yea not only when
prayer is said, but when the Priest blesses. Do thou not know that thou
sta^dest with the Angels, singest with the Angels, thou say Hymns with the^,
and stand thou laughing? It were no marvel if God should se^d out a
thunderbolt, not only upon the^ but upon us also, for surely these things
deserve a thu^der-bolt. In an other place again, Non est ecclesia tonstrina,

Court, but a place of Angels, the Court of Heaven, and Heaven it self.
Surely the devout behavior of the Jews in the Temple, will be a witness to
condemn Christians in the great day. For they to types and figures showed more
reverence than we now a days to the truth and body. Such in those days as
did not regard this reverence of the place, he whipped out, showing by that
base punishment, Ioh 2 15. Cum flagellis titur, ostendit tales homines servile
genus esse, non filios sed seruoss vel mancipia Diaboli. Exodus 3. 5. Exodus 30.
18.
that such people are base, not sons, but servile slaves of the Devil. If
Moses were commanded to put off his shoes, and told that it was holy ground
where God appeared, we may fitly learn by it reverently to demean our selves
in the Church. The washing in the law, when they entered iuto the Tabernacle,
The forbidding of burdens to be carried through the Temple, all showed then,
and teach us now, reverence of Churches and holy places where Gods people are
assembled to hear and serve him. And if he, says Augustine, were worthy great
punishment Co^tra Donatist.
that should abuse a common well where all the City fetch their water, may we
not say much more is he severely to be checked, who abuses the common well
where Gods people fetch the water of life for their souls? yes assuredly, for
the sin is greater. I will wash my hands in innocence says David, and so go
to thine Altar, meaning Psalm. 26. 6.
he would ever remember what that holy place requires. Wicked men will forget
it, and do otherwise, till Gods wrath break out against them. See Nicanor,
Antiochus, 1. Michab 9. 2. Match. 15. 2. Match. 3. Dan 5.
and Heliodorus in the Machabees, and Belshazzar in Daniel. When ye king
conceived that Haman would have forced Queen Hester, he took it the worse,
because it was in his house, and before him, and we meaner men also cannot
abide our poor houses to be abused, and polluted by any: How much more should
not Gods house, where he is and sees all? Stat Sacerdos Dei orationem offerens
cunctorum, tu aute^ rides, nihil timens? Non contremiscis, non colligis
teipsu^? Chrysostom. 15. in Hebr.
In aula^ Regia^ intraturus, et habitu, et oculis et incessu co^ponis te et
exornas, huc aute^ ingressurus, vbi est aula Regis Coelestis, rides, garris,
ambulas, negotiaris. The Priest stands, says Chrysostom again, offering up
the prayers of all, and do thou flire and laugh fearing nothing? do thou
not tremble and recall thy self? If thou were about to enter into a Princes
Court, thou would order thy habit, thy look, and thy gate, but e^tring into
the church, which is the Court of ye heavenly King, thou do laugh, iangle,
walk and make bargains. As a wise man knows ye difference of times and
places, and when to speak and when to hold his peace: so a fool observes
none, but does in the Church what was to be done in his private house. And as
the swine puts his filthy foot in the very same trough where he puts
his mouth to take his meat: so the profane Man and Woman there speak to
their dog, where they pray to their GOD, and show no reverence to so holy a
place. In old time men's houses were their Churches, Chrysostom. Hom. 36. in 1.
Cor.
but now the Churches are our houses, yea more profaned than our houses, with
noise, with babbling, with gazing and staring at every one that comes in, or
goes out, with fliring and laughing, with sleeping, and what not that is
unfit? If we will buy and bargain, meet at the Church; if you will brawle and
brable, meet at the Church; thus, thus are we odious to God and men for
abusing the house of Almighty God. The Priests of Dago^ and 1. Kings. 5. 5.
all that came into Dagons house forbear to tread on the threshold where Dago^
their Idol brake his neck, for very reverence; and we show no reverence in the
Court of the High God, his Church and Temple. To go in to please God and
further to displease him, and so to increase the sin thou prayedst pardon
for, what a madness is it, if it be well considered? Great care then let us ever
have in the Church of God, where Father, Son, and Holy Ghost behold us, to
do nothing any way unfitting the place. The Lord shall never suffer such
Christian reverence of his house want a rich and comfortable blessing. Let us

also consider the dullness of many men to adorn this house, to repair it, to
maintain it, and do these remember it is Gods house? what cost we bestow on
our own dwellings who sees not? and yet never shall they be ours longer than
this GOD shall keep them to us, whose house we thus neglect. Truly it is
fearful to see Men's backwardness in this behalf. Were GOD without a house
til they built one, that will not uphold one already built, it would be long.
How then can they say they desire his dwelling among them, and his presence to
their comfort? No, no, they are far from feeling ye true use of Church
meetings, that thus hardly, or not at all are drawn to any contributions for
them. They taste not what Apol cap. 19.
Tertullian tasted, when he said, Coit caetus, co^gregantur omnes, et quasi
manufacta praecationibus ambiunt Deumorantes. Grata haec vis est Deo, quodque
singulis petentibus negaturus forte fuerit, multoru^ vnanimitati precantium
fere tribuit. The assembly comes together, and all meeting as it were with an
host or band of men, they set upon GOD with their joined prayers, and the Lord
accepts well such force offered unto him, granting commonly to that one
voice of many, what he would not have granted to some of them if they had been
several. Surely as many sticks make a greater fire, and many strings a fuller
music: so is the meeting of many in the Church to pray together, a fire of
great heat, and an harmony passing pleasing to the Lord. The Churches are
like those Cities of refuge, which God appointed among the Israelites, whither
he that had offended might fly and find pardon, only those Sanctuaries were
for some kind of faults, and the Church is for all kind, so that we heartely
and unfeignedly cry, Lord forgive, and what a comfort is this Meditation, if you
follow it? Does the husbandman sow, only for the pleasure he takes to sow,
or does he it to the end he may reap? Does the Merchant only adventure for
a pleasure to sail, or does he it to gain and get? So, so must a Christian
Man or Woman go to the Church, not for the pleasure of walking, or such like,
but to get and gain some spiritual comfort and profit, which if we do,
certainly that God, that sees our hearts, desires, and driftes, will
mercifully and graciously answer the same to our good contentment. Let these
things therefore increase our love to the Church, to go to it, to spend the
time well when we are there, and to tarry out ye end of all divine duties
there, which last point S. Chrysostom exhorts unto by much persuasion,
finding the fault even then as it seems, which too too much abou^deth in our
Churches, namely to depart away before the end of Prayers and Sermon.

adhibeatur, nec te sanet, an non altero die adhibebis? Si incisor arboris vno

help thee not the first day, will thou not use it the second day again? A
feller of a tree, if he cannot smite it down at one blow, will he not smite
again and again till it fall? So then entering into the Church, and admitted
to the company of Christ, depart not away till thou be dismissed. For if thou
do go forth, thou shall be called for again as a fugitive. All the whole day
thou can be content to bestow in things concerning the Body, and can thou
not bestow two hours upon spiritual matters? To the Theater where the play
is thou will come, and not depart before the end, and out of GODS house will thou depart before an end? Thus effectually did that godly Father then
reprove this fault, and let it move us much. Diverse Councilles also laid
down express Decrees against it, as Council. Agathen. Council. Aurel.
may be seen. But let this suffice of this matter occasioned by the end and
use of this Sanctuatie, which God here would have built, Namely, that he might

them.

6 The last point is the form and fashion of it, which God here expressly
commands should be According to all that he showed him, even so should he
make it, and all the instruments of it. Afterward often it is repeated
according to that pattern which God showed Moses in the Mountain verse. 40.
Wherein we are most plainly taught, that in the service and worship of God
our devises and inventions must have no place, but carefully and precisely we
must ever serve him according to his own pattern and prescription left us in
his holy Word. Much has the Word of this matter, and we must be very heedefull
of it. Hear O Israel says the Lord, the ordinances and laws which I teach
you, etc. Ye shall put nothing to the Word which I command you, neither shall
you take ought there from. Again, ye shall not do whatsoever seems good in
your own eyes: But to the place which the Lord your God shall choose, thither
shall you bring all that I command you, etc. Again, Ye shall have fringes
upon the borders of your garments and put upon the fringes of the borders a
riba^d of blew silk. That when you look upon them, ye may remember all the
commandments of the Lord to do them, and THAT YE SEEK NOT AFTER YOUR OWN
HEART, NOR AFTER YOUR OWN EYES, etc. The punishment of transgressing in this
kind you may read in many places in ye Old and New Testament. He that
breaks the least of these commandments shall be counted the least in the
kingdom of God. If any man love me, he will keep my Word. Then are you my
friends, if you do what I command you. The Apostle condemns all voluntary
religion to the Colossians and the place is worthy looking on. Therefore
himself expressly mentions, that touching the holy Sacrament he delivered
nothing but what he had received. For in vain, in vain, says he, do we
worship God, teaching for doctrines men's precepts. Secondly, in that God showed
Moses a pattern, we may consider that as a builder before he build a house, in
a paper uses to draw ye whole plot and form: so God Almighty before the
sending of his Son in our flesh, which is ye builder of ye new Testament, in ye
Ceremonies of ye law, as in a paper or pattern, drew and discovered the manner
of his worship and mercies and favors in Christ. And as the same builder after
he has finished the work, takes away and throws down all scaffoldes and
proppes and stays used before; so the Lord soon after the resurrection of
Christ, having ended the happy work of our salvation, took away all the
Mosaicall policy, with these Ceremonies, that only Christ might be looked at,
and not these, not sparing that glorious material Temple, which if it had
stood, never would or could men have been drawn from these shadows to the
body and truth of all.

This matter of the Tabernacle is again spoken of in the 35. Chapter whither
you may turn and read that with this, out of which reading happily this
Question may come in your mind, why God would have either now suich a
sumptuous Tabernacle erected, or afterward such a glorious Temple? And you may
answer thus. That because the Heathen and Gentiles had all things so rich and
costly in their Temples, therefore it pleased God to match and exceed that
beauty, least ignorant souls should have thought him less worth, being ye
true and everlasting God, than those Idols, and his children and people baser
and less to be regarded than those Idolaters, true Religion worse than false
and so have fallen away to their utter consusion. Which also was some reason,
why the Lord burdened them with such a multitude of Ceremonies, lest they
should have leisure to look unto the Gentiles, and to devise new matters in
imitation of them, as man's curious Nature is too apt to do. Ablessed care of
humane frailty, and an unsearchable goodness to keep man from falling. But a
second Question arises upon this, whether now under the Gospel it should not
be so also, seeing Temples of Idolaters and Idolatry are now also very glorious
to ye eye? The Answer is true, No. For, as S. Paul teaches, all these
Mosaicall Ceremonies Colloss. 2. 17.
were but shadows of things to come, and the Epistle to the Hebrews plainly
says, that the Old Testament was nothing but the shadow of the New, which
shadows are vanished the body and truth being come, as was said a little
before. For a time thus it pleased God to submit himself to man, and to teach
him by these things, but it was not the course he intended to continue. Since
therefore the Jews had a commandment, and Romish Idolaters now have none,
since those things represented what now is come, and can no longer be
represented as future, you see the case is far differing, and He said well
that said it: Tell me ye Priests, what does gold in the Church or in Di^ite
Po^tifices, in Templo quid facit aurum? Nempe hoc quod veneri donatae a virgin
puppa.
Gods worship, etc? Thus could the Satyricall Poet reprehend the excess of the
Gentiles in adorning their Churches. Exuperius Bishop of Tolouse a city of
Narbon in France near the Pyrene mountains carried the Sacrament in a little
wicker basket (I mean the bread,) and the wine in a glass. S. Hierom writing
to Nepotian inueigh eth also against too much glory and glistering in
Churches. Saint Ambrose likewise in his Offices, lib. 2. cap. 28. And when in
the Council it was argued whether golden or wooden vessels were fit for the
Temple, Boniface the martyr answered: Cum aurei essent Sacerdotes, ligneos
habuerunt calices, nunc lignei Sacerdotes volunt habere aureos calices. When
the Priests were golden, they had wooden cups, but now when the Priests are
wooden, they will have golden cups. These things reprove not what is fit in
Churches, but condemn rightly all unnecessary excess and superfluity, such
as is in Popish Churches at this day, and was in use among the Gentiles; God is
now worshipped in spirit and truth. John. 4. 24.

Now as an appendix, here I may remember you, what Beda says of these things,
to wit: Cuncta haec quae Dominus sibi a priore populo ad faciendum Sanctuarium
materialiter Verse, 3.
offerri praecepit; nos quoque qui spirituales filij Israel, hoc est, qui
imitatores Dei viuentis populi esse desideramus spirituali intelligentia
debemus offerre, quatenus per huiusmodi oblationes voluntarias, and ipsi
Sanctuarium ei in nobis facere mereamur, and ipse in medio nostrum habitare,
hoc est, in cord nostro mansionem sibi consecrare dignetur. Cui, videlicet,
Aurum offerrimus, cum claritate verae sapientiae, quae est in fide recta,
resplendemus: Argentum, cum ex ore nostro confessio fit ad salutem: Aes, cum
eandem fidem publica praedicatione diuulgare gaudemus: Hyacinthum, cum sursum
corda leuamus: Purpuram, cum corpus passioni subijcimus: Coccum bis tinctum,
cum gemino, hoc est, Dei and Proximi amore flagramus: pilos caprarum, cum
habitum poenitentiae and luctus induimus: pelles arietum rubricatas, cum ipsos
Dominici gregis ductores suo sanguine baptizatos videmus; pelles ianthinas, cum
nos post mortem spiritualia corpora habituros esse speramus: Ligna Sittim, cum
expugnatis peccatorum spinetis, munda carne and anima, Domino soli seruimus:
Oleum ad luminaria conciunanda, cum fructibus charitatis and misericordiae
refulgemus: Aromata, vnguentum, and Thymiamata boni odoris, cum opinionem bonae
nostrae actionis, multis ad exemplum been viuendi long lateque diffundimus:
Lapides onychinos, and gemmas ad ornandum Ephod, cum miracula Sanctorum, quibus
cogitationes Deo deuotas and opera virtutum ornauere, digna laud praedicamus,
atque haec in adiutorium fidei nostrae, vbi opus, assumimus, etc. All these
things which the Lord commanded to be materially offered unto him by the
people of Israel to make a Sanctuary; we also which are the spiritual
children of Israel, that is, which desire to be the followers of the people of
the living God, must offer the same understanding the^ spiritually, so far as
by such vountarie offerings, both we may deserve to make a Sanctuary unto him
in us, and also he may vouchsafe to dwell in the midst of us, that is, to
consecrate unto himself a mansion place in our hearts. For example, we offer
unto him Gold, when we do shine by the brightness of true wisdom, which is
the right faith: Silver, when with the mouth also, confession is made to
salvation. Brass, when we delight to noise abroad the same faith by public
praising of it. Blew silk, when we lift up our hearts: Purple, Ver. 4.

have spiritual bodies: The wood Shittim, when the thickets and the thorns of
sin being broken through with a clean body and soul we serve the Lord
only: Oil for the light, when we be beautified with the fruits of love and
mercy: Spices for annoynting oil, and for the perfume of sweet savor, when
we spread far and wide the opinion of our well doing, to be an example unto
many of well living: Onix stones, and stones to adorn the Ephod, when we do

wherewith they have beautified their devout thoughts and vetuous deeds: And
these things, for helping our faith, (when need is) we take to our selves.

The Arc.
Having passed over the Preparation of Ceremonies and shadows, now in the
tenth verse begins the matter it self, and first of the Arc. They shall
also make an Verse. 10.

sign unto that people of God his presence amongst them, and therefore as in
other things the name of the thing signified is attributed to the sign, so is
it in this. For you read David's words so, when he sent to fetch the Ark of God. WHOSE NAME IS CALLED BY THE NAME 2. Sam. 6. 2. Numb. 10. 35. 1. Sam. 3. 5.
OF THE LORD OF HOSTS, THAT DWELLS BETVVEEN THE CHERVBIMS. And in the Book
of Numbers, when the camp removed they spoke to it as to God. Up Lord and let
thine enemies be scattered. etc. Secondly, as men are apt and prone to abuse
outward signs and Sacraments, tying God to them, and too much trusting in
them: so did the Israelites abuse this Arc. For in the time of Heli yt Priest,
when they had war with the Philistines and were put to the worse, straight way
they sent for the Arc out of Shiloh, and allege this reason, That it might
save them out of the hands of their enemies. And when it came into the host
they shouted a mighty shout, so that the earth rang again, when God was not
tied to the Arc, but could be present with them without it, neither could the
outward matter of the Arc profit them. So abuse some men yt words of the
Scripture, as of S. John his Gospel, hanging the^ about their necks, and
putting trust in yt outward words, whereof S. Chrysostom much complains, if
that be his work upon Matthew which is ascribed to him. Thus in our time is ye
Sacrament of the Lords body abused, by carrying the outward signs up and down
on horsback, and foot, and giving that to the sign which is proper to the
thing signified. Thirdly, for yt Name you may observe, it is called the Arca
foederis. 1. Sam. 4. 3. Arca Testamenti Arca Testimonij. Aug. lib. 10. de
ciuit. cap. 17. Testimonii arca^ dictam dicit, non solum quod voluntatis

Arc of the Covenant, the Arc of the Testament, and the Arc of the
Testimony. The reason, because in this Arc was ye law kept written in the two
tables, which law is called ye book of the Covenant Exo. 24. 7. or ye Testament
of God, Psalm. 78. 10. or the Testimonies of God. ps. 119. Blessed are they that

Testimonies, as in all manner of riches. And in this Chapter, Thou shall put in
the arc, the Testimony which I shall give thee. v. 16. for the like cause also
shall you read the whole Tabernacle called the Tabernacle of the Covenant or of
the Testimony because Tabernaculum soederis, sieve Testimonij. Beda. Arca de

it contained this Arc wherein the law was. Fourthly, for ye signification
some make this Arc a figure of Christ and resemble it thus. The wood whereof
the Ark was made, was Sittim wood, a durable and lasting wood, not subject to
worms and corruption as other wood is: so representing and shadowing the
humanity of Christ, whose body in the grave felt no corruption or
putrefaction as other men's flesh and bodies do, neither was subject to sin.
That wood was ouerlaid with pure gold both within and without: so shadowing out
the divine nature of Christ united to his manhood, the incomprehensible
excellency whereof, we have nothing here in earth more precious than Gold to
resemble, and yet even in that no comparison. The crown of gold that went
about it shadowed the Majesty of his kingdom of which so great things are
spoken in the Scripture. The Ringes and the Bars by which the Arc was
carried, were shadowing figures of the preaching of the Gospel, by which
Christ is carried and borne from place to place through the world, as his own
divine will shall appoint. The Bars remained ever in the Rings, and might not
be taken out, so figuring that preaching and Christ must not be severed, but
ever be together. Wherefore whosoever teaches and preaches man's merits as
either wholly or partly the cause of salvation, y^ Preacher and Teacher pulls
the Bars out of ye Rings and seuereth them from the Arc, a thing forbidden
and unlawful, offending God, hurting eternally the party so doing, without
undeserved mercy. The Arc must be carried only by the Levites, and not by
every Tribe; so is there a calling still to the preaching of the word, and
every man indifferently may not do it: those Levites were able to carry the
Arc, and so should men called to the Ministry be able to preach in some
measure, though not in like measure, as neither had the Levites like bodily
Math. 25. 15.
strength, neither had like burdens imposed upon them. They were also willing
and careful to do what they were able and commanded to do; and certainly even
so should it be in preaching: power and pains should go to gether, otherwise
the sin is as great now, as it should have been then, in that kind of bearing
that material Arc the figure and shadow of Christ and of this bearing of him
before our brethren, if it had been then neglected either for want of strength
or will. Hence are the Ministers called the pillars of the Church. A thing not
so deeply considered of many Ministers as it should, and as I pray God make it
to be. To the calling we come of carrying the Arc, but from the pains many
run, and let the Arc alone. It will not ever be borne of a just God, and
therefore happy he that returns soonest to his office. This Arc, as has
been said, was a sign of Gods presence, so that when the Arc was there, God
was thought to be there, but how much more is Jesus Christ the cause that God
is present with us? from whom our sin had so severed Hebr. 9. 4. John. 6. 51.

us, as where we were he would not be, and where he was we could not be. In
this Arc was the law, to shadow how Christ for us should undergo the law,
satisfy and fulfill it in all points, and so free and deliver us from it.
There was the pot of Manna shadowing that Christ should be the true bread from
Heaven nourishing to eternal life all those that faithfully feed upon him.
And thirdly there was Aarons rod that budded, so to represent the Priesthood of
Christ for ever. (after the order of Melchisedech) and his Resurrection, who
being dead lived again, as Aarons rod dead and dry budded and bare again.
Finally, where the Arc was, there was it lawful to serve God, and not in
every place; and where Christ is, there is the Church, and without him, no
service nor labor acceptable, in whom and by whom only we can please. What an
excellent figure then was this Arc of Christ, and how rightly, though
somewhat obscurely (for so then it pleased God to deal) did it lay before the
Jews their future Messiah? Others have made it a figure of the Church and
followed the application that way. As for the name, the Arc, as you have
heard, was called the Arc of his Covenant; and what is the true Church but the
people of his Covenant, that is, a peculiar flock and company chosen of God,
with whom he has made a gracious league and covenant as you read in Esaias, The
mountains shall remove, and the hills shall fall down; but my mercy shall
not depart Esaias. 54. 10.

mouth of thy seed from hence forth for ever. A comfortable meditation in all
the storms and stirs of the Church Militant here on earth, to look and
run unto this Covenant which shall never fail, because God is true, and to
consider that whatsoever men be, or do, or threaten to do, the Church depends
not upon men nor their favors, or leagues, or promises, but upon Gods covenant
with it, even the Almighty maker of all ye worlds Mass, who blows upon all
earthly Potentates and they perish, who saves not with bow and spear, but
with his word and will, no confederacies of men being able to endure his wrath.
He, he is our strength and stony rock, he is our defense, our Savior, our
God, and our Psalm. 18. 1.
might, in whom we will ever trust, our buckler, the horn also of our
salvation, and our refuge. By his commandment it is said to the members of his
Church, I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. As much, as if he should will his Minister to say from him to me, to
you, to every one particularly, (...) the Almighty God maker and preserver of
all things together with my coeternall Son crucified for thee, and raised up
again, and with the Holy Ghost powered upon the Apostles, make with thee a
Covenant of everlasting peace, which by no power of the Devil or his members
shall ever be made frustrate. And to this Covenant I fly in all my fears,
seeking no unlawful means, but remembering comfortably the words spoken,
Quoniam in me sperauit, liber abo eum; protegam eum, quia cognouitnomen meum,
etc. Because he has hoped in me, I will deliver him; I will save him, because
he has known my Name. I am with him in trouble (to wit, as his confederate) I
will deliver him and exalt him to honor, I will fill him with length of life,
and show him my salvation. Then for the keeping of the law, as the two Tables
of Moses were kept in the Area typus Ecclesiae, quae est fida custos

sua. Adsunt illi Cherubini: sic Angelorum omnium ministerium Ecclesiae, qui

Arc: so is the Church the keeper of the Scriptures, not only by intertaining
and holding the holy doctrine in our senerall hearts as in an Arc, but even
also by preserving the Books and the ministry of that trueh to the end of
the world, in prosperity and adversity. So, whether we apply it as a figure
of Christ, or of the Church, you see the consideration of this Arc may yield
us many good meditations.

The Mercy Seat.
THe Arc, as you may see, had a cover appointed to be made for it, which was
the Mercy Seat or the Propitiatory. The words of your Bible are thus. Also
thou shall make a Mercy seat of pure gold two cubits Verse. 17.
and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad. And thou shall make two
Cherubims of gold, etc. How notable a figure again this was of Christ, I pray
you see; for 18
first, it was the cover of ye Ark where the law of Moses lay: and who hides
and covers us from the wrath of God, and from the accusation of the law but
Jesus Christ? He is like a cool shadow to fly unto in the scorching heat of
Gods deserved displeasure, which is a consuming fire. And were it not for him,
up would the law rise against us Hebr. 12. 29.
with his heavy curse, and cry for condemnation against us for our manifold
breaches and contempts, which no flesh is able to abide. Whereupon the Psalmist
says, O Lord, O Lord, if thou will mark what is done amiss, who, Psalm. 130.
3.
who is able to endure it? But do not thou, O Lord, enter into judgment with
thy servant (to wit, without this Psalm. 143. 2.
mercy seat, cover, or propitiatory) for without Christ thy Son represented
and shadowed hereby, shall no flesh be justified in thy sight. Our first
Parents having sinned, covered themselves with Fig leaves, and did Genesis 3. 7.
they help? Even so are all couers beside this, against God and sin, try
them and trust them who will. One Dionysius a sour and severe defender of that
Stoicall vnfeelingnesse Dionysius Heracleotes acerrimus defensor Stoicae
delirationis de Apathia.
of passions, being tormented in his reins, cried out, That all things were
false which he had till then held of pain and grief, as that it might so
easily be borne and endured whatsoever it was; for now he felt the contrary,
that pain pincheth and will be felt, notwithstanding all plasters of
philosophy and humane reasons. Even so shall the sense of Gods divine
judgment convince all hypocrites when he shall please to touch them with it,
and make them confess, that will worship and outward works whatsoever, are as
fig leaves to hide them from God and their sins, whatsoever opinion they
have formerly held of the force and merit of them, and that Christ only is the
cover of the Arc, when the accusing law lies, to whom whosoever fly, and in
whom whosoever trust, being justified by faith, they have peace with God
through him. Think you then of it for ever, and lay hold on him, and on him
Romans 5. 1.
only, by your unfeigned faith in him, if you mean to be sure and safe
without peril and hazard. He is our mouth whereby we speak unto God, he is
our eye whereby we see God, and he is our hand whereby we offer to God. Quo
nisi intercedente, nec nobis nec omnibus Sanctis cum Deo quicquam est. Without
whose intercession, neither we, nor any of the Saints have any thing to do with
God. Quem inuenirem qui me tibi reconciliaret? an eundum mihi ad Angelos? At
qua prece? quibus Sacramentis? verus Mediator Christus. Who^ should I find to
reco^cile me to thee (says S. Angustine.) Must I go unto Angels? But with
what prayer? with what Sacraments? The true Mediator is Christ. Quisquis pro
peccato compunctus esurit and sit it iustitiam, credat in te qui iustificas
impium, and per solam fidem iustificatus pacem habebit apud Deum. Whosoever
feels compunction for sin, and hungreth and thirsts after righteousness,
let him believe in thee that do justify the wicked, and by faith only he
shall have peace with God, says S. Bernard. Non in fletibus and actibus
nostris, sed in Aduocati nostri allegatione confidimus. We do not trust in our
weeping or working, but in the allegation or pleading of our Advocate for us,
says S. Gregory. Thus spoke the old Fathers all, and we must mark it. Popes
pardons were pro fisco, non pro Christo, for their own gain, not for the good
of Christ's people, as One of their own side said well of them. etc.

2 Secondly, it was of gold, that so it might shadow and show, yt all though
Christ should suffer and die for sin, yet he should himself have no sin, but
be pure as gold, that is, holy, just, unspotted, the immaculate Lamb of God in
whom there is no blemish of impuritie. Hebr. 4. 15.
In all things (says the Apostle) he was tempted in like sort, yet without
sin.

3 Verse. 18.
There were two Cherubims set upon this Apponebantur ad arcam, vt ille qui
colebatur intelligeretur esse Do. exercituum, summis etia^ spiritibus
praeside^s: qua ratione passim super Cherubim sedere dicitur. Psalm. 80. 1. and
Psalm. 99. Esaias. 37. 16 etc. Cur Deus non di a(...)r sedere super Seraphim
Hierony. Epist. 113. ad Damase.
Mercy seat, in manner as you see expressed in the picture of your Bible,
which Cherubims, whatsoever Josephus says, were, in the most received opinion,
like Yet conclude not that Cherubims are ever like Angels, but see Ezech. 1. 10.
Angels, happily to shadow out the subjection of all Angels to Christ, and
their ready service at his commandment for the Church and any particular
member thereof. For unto which of the Angels, says the Apostle, did God say at
any time, Heb. 1. 5. Psalm. 2. 7.
Thou art my Son, this day begat I thee? No, it is said, Let all the Angels
of God woship him. And of the Angels he says, He makes the Spirits his
messengers, and his ministers Psalm. 104. 4. Of Cherubims, see Sixtus Senensis
lib. 5. biblij. annot. 58
a flame of fire. Also to show, as they are obedient and serviceable at all
appointments, so should we be; remembering the incomprehensible goodness of our
God, who among other his infinite favors whereby he binds us to his service,
has made even this, one, That these holy Angels also are our servants by his
appointment. A mighty motive to a good and thankful mind to labor to become
obedient and dutiful to such a Father, to such a Creator, to such a God.
Lastly, to figure out, that when we draw near to the Propitiatory (a figure
of Christ,) and are of God in his great mercy adopted in Christ for his
sons, we are called, and as it were joined to the company and society of
the Cherubims and holy Angels of God: A comfort also for us that come unto him.

4 The Cherubims stretch their wings on high, covering the Mercy Seat with
their wings: so representing Verse. 20.
the majesty of Christ, who though he should humble himself to a very low
estate for man's good, yet indeed was of that glory and brightness in his
Godhead, as no flesh could be able to behold, but must Math. 17. 2. See his
transfiguration. Twelve legions of Angels could he have had. etc.
hide their eyes, and acknowledge their infirmity, if but a small glimse
thereof should be showed them. Figuring also the most comfortable protection of
the Lord Jesus our Savior, who spreads as it were his wings over his Church,
and every member of it, to repulse any harm that might happen, other than he
will graciously turn to his glory, and the Church or parties good, which then
indeed is no harm, but a benefit rather, although bitter to the flesh, and
disgraceful in the world. Thus spread he his wings over Jacob, and saved him
from Laban; over Joseph, and saved him from his brethren; over Eliah, and saved
him from Iesabell; over Elisha, 2. King. 6: and thus ever as the Hen to her
chickens, so is the Lord our gracious God to all that truly fear him. A
marvelous sweet Meditation, if you follow it.

5 The faces of these Cherubims were one toward another, and both of them
toward the Mercy Seat: so representing the consent of the Old and New
Testament, in both which there is but one truth and one doctrine; the Old
having his face toward the New, and the New also Act. 26. 22.
looking at the Old. For what is the Old Testament, but the new (obscure?)
and what the new Testament, but the Old made plain? And both Old and New
look upon Christ, the promised seed of the woman that should bruise the
Serpents head. They being saved in the old Testament, by believing he should
come; and we being saved in the New, by believing he is come.

6 And there (says God) I will declare my self unto Verse. 22.
thee, and from above the Mercy Seat between the two Cherubims which are upon
the Arc of the Testimony, I will tell thee all things, which I will give thee
in commandment unto the children of Israel. Still note the excellency of
this figure of the Mercy Seat. For as God before had spoken out of the bush,
Exodus 3. 4. verse. and out of the cloud, Numb. 12. 5. verse: so hereafter, says
he, I will speak to you from betwixt these Cherubims, and so he did. For in
the Book of Numbers you read thus; When Moses went into the Tabernacle of the
congregation, Numb. 7. 89.
to speak with God, he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from the
Mercy Seat, that was upon the Arc of the Testimony between the two
Cherubims, and he spoke to him. Whereupon the Prophet Esaias says, God Esaias. 37.
16. Psalm. 99. 1.
dwells between the Cherubims. And David in his Psalm also. The Lord is
King, be the people never so impatient, he sits between the Cherubims, be
the earth never so unquiet. And again, Hear O thou Shepeheard Psalm. 80. 1.
of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like sheep: show thy self also, that
sit upon the Cherubims. And fitly did this resemble Christ by whom God
afterward would speak unto his Church whatsoever he would command. As the
Apostle writes to the Hebrews, when he says: At sundry times, and in diverse
manners God Hebr. 1. 1.
spoke in the old time to our Fathers by the Prophets; but in these last days
he has spoken to us by his Son: which still he continues and will unto the
end of the world, though not by living voice and personal presence in earth as
he did for a time. How then? Still look upon the figure. Two Cherubims were
upon the Mercy seat representing (as you have heard) the Two Testaments, and
from between those two Cherubims God spoke: so does Christ still by the Two
Testaments, the old and the new, the law and the Gospel, the Prophets and
Apostles; and so will he still speak to the end. Other ways we must not now
expect; Revelations and dreams, visions and miracles are ceased, and if they
will not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they believe, if one should
rise and come from the dead unto them. In Moses and the Prophets is the new
Testament contained, though obscurely, as you have heard; and therefore still
to these Cherubims resort, if you mean to hear your God speak. Huge is the
heap therefore of their sin, that bar Gods people from this way, and will
make themselves to be Cherubims only to be heard and believed, shamefully
affirming, That the people are not to search the Scriptures, but to receive all
things from their Teachers upon their bare credit, not reasoning, not
disputing, not asking any Questions more than the horse asks his master, why
he turns him this way, or that? but simply obeying. Thus never dealt God with
people since he gave them his Scriptures you well know; but as the other parts
of their spiritual armor, Helmet, Breastplate, and Ephesians. 6. 17.
so forth, so he bad them take their weapon, (without which what should armor
do?) even their sword, which, says he, is the word of God. But truth seeks no
darkness, and lies love no light. Be you armed being warned, and go you to
the Cherubims, where you shall hear God (that deceives not) speak unto you,
knowing that as these people of the Jews were tied to the Propitiatory, so
are we now to Christ in his word.

The Table of the Show bread.
1 THou shall also make a table of Shittim wood of two Verse. 23.
cubits long, etc. The building and parts you must read in your Bible. This
Table again was a third figure of Christ who is propounded of God to his
Church as a table furnished with all dainties and contents. Nothing 1. Cor. 1.
30. wisdom, righteousness. etc.
is wanting in him that we can want and is good for us to have, but ask and
you shall have, seek and you shall find. He is the riches of God to all that
believe in him. The Show bread upon this Table represented the word and the
preaching of the same, whereby as by bread man is fed, strengthened, and
continued alive. The one thus works to his body, the other effects it to
his soul. A great blessing is the one, a far greater is the other. And
therefore labor not for the meat which perishes says our Savior Christ, but
for the meat which John. 6. 27.
indureth to eternal life, etc. It was called Show bread because it always
showed it self before God. For it was not lawful to remove the old before
they brought and placed their new, and so it never wanted, verse. 30. In Hebrew,
the bread of faces, because it ever stood before the face of God, as a
continual remembrance of the twelve Tribes of Israel. The being of it
continually, figured how preaching ought to be continual.

2 When as the Israelites did eat of the same wheat whereof the Show bread
was made (the same being of the first fruits of their corn offered) they were
thereby admonished by type and sigure to eat and drink ever as if they sat
before God and were his guestes. And that the bread and meat whereon they fed
was in some sort holy and consecrate to God, to be used therefore soberly and
reverently. The like good meditation may we have at this day, although we have
not the same Ceremony. For whose are all the creatures we use for the
refreshing of our bodies, but the Lords? And should we then abuse them
riotously, profanely, wastfully and wickedly, as many do? The fault is
manifest, the truth and right is as manifest. Such as be Gods will note it, and
amend it, if there be any fault, giving thanks both before and after, for such
goodness as we little deserve, and use them well.

3 Thou shall also make dishes (to set the bread upon) Verse. 29.
for it, and incense-cups, and couerings, and goblets, etc. Deservedly was that
Bishop commended, which sold the holy vessels in the time of famine to relieve
the poor with the money, and excused himself to the Church: That because GOD
neither eats nor drinks, therefore he needs no dishes nor cups. But to
have said thus in the time of these Ceremonies, and by that pretext to have
robbed the house of GOD of those things, had not been well. For every thing
has his proper time. As then to take them away, being commanded for Types and
figures, had been evil: so now to bring them in without commandment, and to
keep figures when the truth and body is come, is also unlawful. Which might
yield a sober mind due contentment against the idle and superfluous furniture
of Popish Churches, neither to desire it when it is wanting, nor to like it
when it is present. Neither is the Church now in her infancy; nor true
believers in their minority; but shadows are gone, Christ is come, and his
true worshippers worship him in spirit and truth. Moses and the Prophets are
read John. 4. 23.
and preached, men's hearts are opened by the holy Ghost in the ministry of
the word being powerful and strong. Good life is sought and sin is
reproved. Prayers are offered up unto God in a tongue understood, the
Sacraments administered duly according to their Institution; and this is a
blessed beauty in a Church, though there be neither Gold nor Silver shining
upon the walls. The truth and comfort of conscience shining within us is far
more excellent etc.

The Candlestick.
ALso thou shall make a Candlestick of pure gold: of Ver. 31.
work beaten out with the hammer shall the Candlestick be made, his shaft and
his branches, his bowls and his knops: and his flowers shall be of the same. Six
branches shall come out of the sides of it, etc. A fourth figure Ver. 32.
of Christ is this Candlestick, and of other good things also taught by it
mystically. As first, the whole Candlestick being an instrument of light,
notes out fitly, that even so, Christ is the light of his church, which light
of his, in his holy Scriptures he proposech continually to Men and Women that
will read them. The Heathens and Pagans had their Religion: but because they
had not this Candlestick Christ, therefore they had no light, but were vain
in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was full of darkness. They turned the
glory of the incorruptible God to the Romans 1. 23.
similitude of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and four footed
beasts, and of creeping things. They turned the truth of God into a lie, and
worshipped 25
and served the Creature, forsaking the Creator, etc. The Faithful have this
Candlestick, and therefore their Religion is true, they have light and know
what they worship. John. 4. 22.
Their actions and manners also are directed aright: for they are made to see
what truly pleases, and what truly displeases, not following their own
imaginations and wills, doing what seems good in their own eyes, but what
God has commanded, that do they.

2 The Candlestick was in the Sanctuary or Church, and the light of the Word
whereby Christ shines should be in the Church, that all the congregation
thither coming might see and receive the comfort of it. This is the true
beauty of a Church indeed, as has been said, and therefore either their
ignorance, or their malice was monstrous, who set Candlestickes of Gold, and
Silver, and Shining brass in their Churches, but could not abide the word
unless it were in a strange tongue; all light (but that light) was regarded,
banners and pictures and silks and smelles and all beauty but not the
Scriptures. Therefore seeing they had not the true Candlestick Christ in his
Word giving light, their glory was vanity and their light was gross and
grievous darkness.

3 The Candlestick, as you see in the picture of your Bible, had an upright
stem and six branches issuing out, three on either side of the stem. The
stem represe^ted Christ from whom all light grows, even as the six branches
come from the stem. The branches are set in the stem, and so are all that
give light set in Christ. The Greg. ho. 6. super Ezech. John. 15. 4.
branche, says our Savior, cannot bear fruit of it self, except it abide
in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine; ye are the
branches; he that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much
fruit: for without me can ye do nothing. Even so say you of light. No man is
an instrument of any light to others, but as he himself is in the stem
Christ from whom comes all light. In him men give much light and shine unto
many both far and near by Word and writing, etc.

4 There are many branches of the Candlestick. The branches are chiefly the
Ministers of the Church, and the variety notes their diverse degrees and
orders. These all grafted in the stem, and growing out from the stem, do
also give light in the Sanctuary. A great honor to themselves when they do give
light, and a great comfort to the beholders that see their light. Thus to
shine, is rightly and truly to shine in Gods house, and all glory else, pomp,
and port, and state, is utter vanity if this be away. The light was ever in the
Church, and so diligent should Ministers be that their sound should be heard
still, still, as the Lord wills, In season and out of season, 2. Tim. 4 2.
holy day and work day, if the place require it, and ten thousand times
happy that servant, whom when his master Luke. 12. 38.
comes he shall find so doing. I lay no burdens on any man's back, but the
Lord that called has inioined the work, accounted us faithful, and put us in
his service. He, he it is that has delivered out his money, Mat. 25. 14.
and will look for a reckoning, that lent us his light and will one day ask
what we did with it. He gave it not to be put under a bushel, but to be
showed out to all that are in the house. O that He may give the feeling
remembrance of it! Then will not loyterers condemn laborers, and think it
unfit to preach too often; curiosity shalnot put out the candle a quarter of a
year together, or censure diligence and plainness in others for want of it.
Every man's labor shall be accepted for the end whereunto they are directed, and
godly joy in every man's well doing. That snake of envy will fly away, and
where discouragement has grown, comfort will spring, yt God may be pleased,
and his Church profited by all men's measures and abilities. He that walks in
the midst of the Candlesticks sees the light or darkness of them, and will
remove Apop. 2. 1.
any one that amendeth not, being faulty.

5 This Candlestick had bowls and knops and flowers to adorn it and
beautify it withal. The bowls figuring again the spiritual gifts wherewith
God Almighty does beautify his Pastors and Teachers which are as lights in his
Church, as Wisdom, Learning, Eloquence, 1 Cor. 12. 8. etc.
Tongues, and such like, teaching also these Ministers that as Bowls do
contain and keep water or wine: so should they contain and ever keep
doctrine and exhortation, to cool and comfort the consciences of men bringing
(as the good Scribe) out of their store, things new and old. The knops and
flowers serving for delight, well represented what pleasure and conte^tment
Godly people should take, in a godly Teacher placed by Gods gracious providence
over them. They will not tread upon them but smell to them, not cast them at
their heels but set them in their bosoms, as truly pleasing flowers unto
them. Still gold is the matter, and pure gold, to show out, by way of Ver. 36.
shadow, the excellency of Christ, and of his faithfulll Ministers in him, and
for him.

6 There were again seven Lamps and oil in them Ver. 37. Septimus number erus
numerus plenitudinis.
for this light. The number of Seven noting sufficiency, as (indeed) the Lord
never fails his Church of what he knows needful. Oil commonly
signifies the Gospel and Faith kindled in the hearts of men by the efficacy
of the Ministry; and the lamp shadoweth out a good conscience. Because, as
oil cannot be kept in a broken lamp, but in a whole: so is true Faith ever
preserved in a good conscience; and hurt the conscience, loose faith, loose the
Holy Ghost, and loose eternal life. This is proved by the blessed Apostle,
when he says, Fight a good fight, having 1. Tim. 1. 18. 19. 5.
faith and a good conscience; And again, The end of the commandment is love
out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned.
Furthermore, as the only lamp, empty and dry, could not light those foolish
Virgins to the Bridegroomes chamber: so neither can a good conscience, as
Philosophers spoke of it, that is, honest external action, save a man, without
there be also the oil of the knowledge of the Gospel of Christ. Lastly, as a
Lamp of glass is brittle and soon broken: so the conscience is a very tender
thing, and quickly may becrakt, if not clean broken. A just cause to make men
chary what they do.

7 Snuffers and snuffe-dishes are appointed for these Ver. 38.
lights, wherein we may also profit and be instructed. For first, in that GOD
leaves not the least and basest thing to their wills, but himself appoints
and preand prescribes all, we very truly learn how odious in his service men's
mere inventions be, and how he ever tied men to his own commandment, not
suffering them to do what seemed good in their own eyes, and to salve up the
matter with their good intents. Amongst then many other things in the Word,
even this also should have his force in our hearts, to beat us from
will-worships, and to make us careful to learn how God will be served, and so
only and ever to serve him. Secondly, this is a great comfort to Ministers,
and to all the faithful of God, who are also here shadowed, namely, that
although my gifts be not such as to set me high in the Tabernacle; yet am I not
therefore utterly unprofitable, or unfit, or rejected of God. But if I may be
among the meanest vessels of the Sanctuary and of the Church, If I may be but
as the Snuffers, or Snuffe-dishes, as a door keeper, as a besome, or an
ash-pan, whereof mention will be made hereafter, even this shall well please me,
and herein will I rejoice, thanking my God right humbly, that has looked upon
me in that measure. Every faithful man or woman cannot be great, and have
great places in the Church, the body has diverse members, and all good, and
made by God: the Church has diverse degrees of Believers, and yet all Believers
and loved of God: so, if you be one in any place, blessed be God for it: Your
joy shall be eternal also, and incomprehensible. Thirdly, for the use of these
Snuffers, you know they served to make the lamp and light shine more bright:
So shadowing out, that the doctrine of the Church must be pure, bright, and
light, not mixed with darkness and snuffes in it: and to this end, the Lord
has discipline in his Church and disputations, so to clear, when obscurity
grows, and to set things well that went awrie. Discipline is profitable when
it is rightly exercised by men authorized, but if men not authorized, by means
not allowed, will be snuffing of lights, (indeed) rather aiming to put them
out, than to amend their light, from a good heart to have all well, although
they so may profit the lights accidentallye, yet their own fingers may be so
burned or blacked, as they had better have dealt more charitably. Disputations
also have their excellent use, to clear matters obscure in the doctrine or
light of the Church, but so, that they be rightly ordered and guided, not
being a strife of words, whereof comes envy and raylings, Neither froward
disputations of men of corrupt minds and destitute 1 Timothy 6. 4. 5.
of truth, whereof the Apostle speaks, and bids Timothy avoid them. Both
these good uses and their contrary abuses, we may draw from the matter of ye
Snuffers which was pure gold, so to teach, that neither men exercising
discipline to remove darkness and amend the light, should be brass or iron,
wood, or worse, nor disputations and explications diverse and differing from the
matter of the Candlestick, but both of gold, the one brotherly affected and
meekely minded, the other true, right, natural, agreeing with the body of the
Scripture, with the proportion of faith, and the consent of the godly members
of the Church in their times. Such Snuffers and snuffing we shall ever praise
God for, as heartelie entreat him, on the contrary side, to remove away
malice and rage from vexing his poor servants, and fruitless contentions and
corrupt glosses from hurting or hindering his holy doctrine, the true lamp
that lights unto him. Thus may this Chapter profit us, if we read it over,
and yet abstain from too bold wading into allegories of every particular
thing, as some have done both in times of old and since not without danger and
deserved blame. A measure is fit, and that nothing be urged against Faith.
For, of the two Rules in these things to be observed, the first is, as S. Paul
teaches us, That he which has prophecy, prophecy according Romans 12. 6.
to the proportion of faith, that is, so expound things, as nothing disagree
from the Articles of our faith which (...). aliud pes, aliud numerus sonat.
is a short Sum of all doctrine. This did not Origin observe, and therefore
in all succeeding ages he still carries a blame. The second Rule is out of the
old Proverb, The safest way is the best way. The safest way is that, wherein
the Prophets or Apostles have gone before, who albeit they do not ever at
large fellow an allegory, yet many times they point their fingers at some,
giving so ye diligent Reader occasion to note more. So in Esaias the Story of
Gideo^ 1 Cor. 5. 7. 2 Cor. 3. 13. etc. Gal. 4. 22. etc. Romans 3. 25.
is referred to Christ and his Church. And in S. Paul that of ye paschal Lamb,
of Moses veil, of Abraham's two wives, the freewoman and the bondwoman, of
the propitiatory, etc.

CHAP. 26.
THE former Chapter has showed GOD his purpose to have a Sanctuary or
Tabernacle made, and what offering to that end he required: now will this
Chapter go forward with the description of the same, and in what order things
were placed in it. To the description belong the first thirty verses, and to
the order Division of the Chapter.
the other last seven verses. Touching the Tabernacle, these things you may
mark, the first covering consisting of ten curtains of fine twyned linen,
and blew silk and Ver. 1. etc.
purple, and scarlet with Cherubims of broidered work wrought, as you see in
the picture of your Bible, of which speak the first sir verses. Then the 2.
covering made of curtains of Goats hair, and spoken of from the beginning
Ver. 7. etc.
of the seventh verse unto the fourteenth, upon which was put a covering of
rams skins colored red, and Ver. 14.
a third covering of Badgers skins above that again, Tabernaculum a
tabulatis.
all to defend the weather and to keep the Tabernacle dry. Lastly, a frame of
boordes to support all these couerings, and to make it a house for God and his
people to meet in, from the fifteenth verse to the thirty. Concerning the
order of things laid down in the last seven verses, you must note, that in
this Tabernacle there were three distinct places or rooms. First the outward
Court (as they called it) wherein the people were, where stood the Brazen Altar
and the Lauer, of which you read in the next Chapter, which room was as the
bodies of our Churches. Secondly, a place within that, severed from it, wherein
the Priests only were, in which room stood the Golden Altar of Incense, the
Table of the Shewbread and the Golden Candelsticke. This was called the Holy
Place, and it was as our quires. Thirdly, there was a room within that again,
severed also by a veil wherein did stand the ARC covered with the Mercy
seat or propitiatory, Hebr. 9. 4
and the golden Censer was there kept. Chap. 40. This was called the most holy
place, into which the High Priest but once a year entered, and that with
blood. This was resembled in the Popish time (as I take it) by drawing a
Curtain cross over the quire and so parting the upper end of the quire from
the rest, which, as I remember, was done by them in Lent. Thus was the matter
and form of that Tabernacle.

2 To make allegorical use of all these things one by one, should be
unwarranted curiosity, as I have said; Yet remember what Luther says in Genesis
12. Nihil putandum exiguum, siquidemid. S. S. noluit literis mandare, quod non
profit. what Hierome in Ephesians. 1. Singuli sermones, syllabae, apices, puncta,
in diuinis Scripturis plena sunt sensibus. What Chrysostom. ^o. 18 in Genesis cap.
4. Reconditu^ habe^t thesaurum: or as Origin, instar herbae peculiare^ habent
vim and proprietatem.
Only therefore, as either others have taught us, or as well stands with
Faith, let us walk and profit our selves. And first observe what the Apostle
to the Hebrews does, whose steps we may safely follow, and by his example
apply the Holiest place of all to Christ. Read the 9. and 10. Chapters of that
Epistle. Others, not contrary to the Scriptures, have noted by the Common
Court or Tabernacle in general, the visible Church of God, embracing his Word,
praying to him and heard of him, defended by him in all perils, and in the end
made partaker of eternal life. To this end therefore they think of David's
words in many Psalms, as when he says, O how amiable Psa. 84. 1. 2.
are thy dwellings, thou Lord God of hosts! My soul has a desire and longing
to enter into the Courts of the Lord, etc. Again, One thing have I desired of
the Lord, Psalm. 27. 4.
which I will require, even that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the
days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and to visit his
Temple. For in the 5.
time of trouble he shall hide me in his Tabernacle, yea in the secret place of
his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone. Lord, who
shall dwell in thy Psalm. 15. 1.
Tabernacle? that is, who shall be a member of thy Church? Blessed is the man
whom thou choosest and receiuest unto Psa. 65. 4.
thee: he shall dwell in thy courts, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures
of thine house, even of thy Temple. All which places, under the figure of this
worldly Tabernacle, as the Apostle calls it, note out the visible Church of
God, dispersed now far and wide over the face of the earth, the comforts of it,
and the blessings in it.

3 The sumptuous dignity of every thing so pure, so clean, and so excellent,
noted figuratively the purity of the Church cleansed in Christ, and how
careful every member of the same must be, to keep himself pure and clean,
as the Lord shall strengthen him. The goodly and rich furniture and ornaments
shadowed out (as has been said) the rich gifts and Graces of God powered upon
his Church, and the blessed estate of it under Christ. Of which see a
description in the Prophet Esaias most notable. O thou afflicted and tossed with
tempest, that have Esaias. 54. 11.
no comfort, behold, I will lay thy stones with the Carbuncle, and lay thy
foundations with Saphires. And I 12.
will make thy windows with Emerandes, and thy gates shining stones, and all
thy borders of pleasant stones. And 13.
all thy children shall be taught of the Lord etc.

4 The three distinct Rooms they have applied to three kinds or measures of
righteousness thus. There was an outward Court, and that may represent the first
step to God, when a man uses the outward Ceremonies and actions commanded, as
then of sacrificing, washing, and so forth, now of coming to church, hearing,
etc. Those be good things, but yet a man is not gotten into the Church, only
into ye outward Court he is gotten, and there remains; For evil men may do
these outward matters. Then there was an inward place, called ye Holy place,
and a third within that again, called ye Holiest of all. So they say there is
a second degree of righteousness, or a second step to God, when a man does
these outward things heartily, truly, and unfeignedly, And a third step, when by
so doing, his heart is opened, and he believes in him that redeemed him, and
for ever holds fast by him. And now is he gotten into both, the Holy place,
and the most holy of all. Into the Holy place, in possession, that is, to be a
true and sound member of Christ his Church, and into the most holy of all, by
hope and in expectation, because after this life is ended, he passes into the
presence of God in heaven, and there lives for ever.

5 By the veil, men have noted how the obscurity of those Kites and Ceremonies
was figured, and that the time of full Revelation was not yet come, in which,
things should be most plain, as when Christ came, they were. Those Types and
shadows being open in him, to whom they all carried their meaning. Also, they
noted in it how reverently we must speak and hear of the Majesty of God, of
his Word, of his holy exercises, and whatsoever belongs to Religion. And
lastly, by the rending of the veil from Mat. 27. 51.
the top to the bottom, when Christ suffered, plainly was showed, that then
that kind of teaching the Church by such figures was ended, and they also were
ended. The body and truth was come and had finished all things; Now intending
to pour out his Spirit more abundantly, and to teach more plainly whatsoever
belonged to eternal comfort. Read S. Peter's Sermon in ye 2. of the Acts, when
the Holy Ghost fell upon them, and ignorant men deemed the^ Act. 2. 14. and 3.
and 13.
drunk. Thus may we profit by this Chap. and leave many particulars which idle
men have been too busy with, abounding with (...)
unquiet thoughts and itching love of novelties. Still, still carry this in
your mind, how God loves a place of public meeting for holy exercises, and
to have al his come thither upon days and times appointed, and ever love you
the Church, and be not drawn from it.

CHAP. 27.
THis Chapter also goes forward with the description of the Tabernacle, and
namely of those points which in the former Chapter were not mentioned, as ye
Altar of burnt offerings, the Court of the Tabernacle, and the Lamps
continually burning. Concerning the Altar, how it was made for matter, height,
length, and breadth, the Text is plain, and you may there read it in ye first
8. v. For the use to us, we may note two things. First, that it was a figure
of Heb. 13. 10. etc. Fuit vnicum Altar Sacrificiorum, vt vnus ille
significaretur (...) Christus. Per Cornua notatur vis and potentia Salvatoris
erigentis nobis Cornu Salutis. Cauitate Alearis (...) illa Christi sig. De qua
Apost. ad Philip. 2. Ver. 7. and. 8. Vectibus and instrumentis notantur
Ecclesie Ministri, Christum voce sua and praedicatione fideli ex loco in locum
portantes, purgantes Ecclesiam a sordibus, and fouentes Charitatis ignem. Greg.
Christ, as the Apostle to the Heb. expounds it: and secondly, that the
Altars used in Popery are not warranted by this example. But that the Primative
Church used Communion tables (as we now do) of boords and wood, not Altars (as
they do) of stone. Origin was about 2. hundred years after Christ, and he
says, that Celsus objected it as a fault to the Christians, Quod nec imagines,
nec Templa, nec aras haberent.
that they had neither Images, nor Churches, nor Altars. Arnobius (after him)
says the same of the Heathens. Accusatis nos quod nec Templa habeamus, nec
aras, nec imagines: You accuse us, for that we have neither Churches, nor
Altars, nor Images. Gershon says, that Siluester first caused stone^ Altars to
be made, and willed that no man should consecrate at a wooden Altar, but
himself, and his successors there. Belike then, the former ages knew not that
profound reason, that Altars must be of stone, quia Petra erat Christus,
because the Rock was Christ, as Durandus after devised. Upon this occasion in
some places stone Altars were used for steadiness and continuance, wooden
tables having been before used, but I say in some places, not in all. For S.
Augustine says, that in his time in Aphrica they were made of wood. For ye
Donatists, says he, brake in su^der the Altar-boords, Again, ye Deacons duty
was to remove the Altar. Chrysostom calls it (...) The holy board. S.
Augustine men sa^ Domini, the table of the Lord. Athanasius men sam ligneam,
the table of wood. Yet was this Communion table called an Altar, not that it
was so, but only by allusion metaphorically, as Christ is called au Altar or
our Greg. ho. 22. super Ezec. ad me^tem nostra^, quae ar^ quaedam Dei est,
accomm^da^it.
hearts be called Altars etc. Mark with your self therefore the newness of
this point for stone Altars in comparison of our ancient use of Communion
tables, and let Popery and his parts fall, and truth and sound antiquity be
regarded.

2 Touching the horns of the Altar spoken of, they literally served to keep
up the sacrifice from falling of, and figuratively noted strength: so that, to
bind the sacrifice to the horns of the Altar, was to give themselves wholly
2. Sam. 22. 3.
with a strong faith, and only to rest and trust and stay upon him, and to
tie al carnal affections fast also to the Altars horns, by subduing and
making them captive to God. This Altar was in one place, and the Sacrifice in
one place, noting how Christ should only once, and in one place offer up
himself for all mankind.

3 Concerning the lamps, as little do they warrant Popish tapers and candles,
as the Altars before, did their Altars. And Christians used no such follies and
apish imitations of things abrogated and serving only for the time. For Ceras
non clara luce accendimus, sed vt noctis tenebras temperemus. Hier. con.
Vigilant.
we do not light candles at noon day, says S. Hierom, but in the night we
use lights as a comfort against darkness. The same says Augustine, Eusebius,
and others, whose Testimonies are often used. And Lactantius asks, whether
Nummentis compos putandus, qui authori and datori luminis, candelarum and
cerarum lumen offert pro munere? Lib. 6. cap. 2.
they be well in their wits or no, that offer candles and lights to the Author
and giver of all light? Tertullia^ says, they daily light Candles, who have no
light Accendunt quotidie l^^er^as quibus lux nulla est, illis competunt et
testimonia tenebrarum, immo and auspicia poenarum. De. Idol.
in themselves, to whom agree both the Testimonies of darkness, and the reward
of punishment. But, by way of figure, these lights shadowed Lucerna pedibus
meis verbum tuum. Psa. 119.
the light of Gods Word which ought ever to shine in his Church, as has been
said; and oil usually in the Scriptures notes the Holy Ghost. As in the
Psalm, He has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
And that anointing which he received of him, dwells in you, and ye need not
that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teaches you of all things,
etc. This Holy Spirit Christ gives to his Church, and therefore said, John.
16. 7. Hilar. in Psa. Omnis doctrina coelestis, lux nihis ad iter vitae est,

vtamur. Et vt lume^ exolco luminis habet causam: ita vt lucem spiritualis

It is good for you that I go way. For if I go not away, that Comforter will
not come unto you: but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And this Spirit
makes the light of the Word in the heart, as that oil made the light of the
lamp in the Church. But the Aaron summus Sa^r los luce^^as fouens (...)

tractandi ver(...), quod perpetuo lucet in loco caliginoso, vsque dum Lucifer
exoriatur in cordibus 2. Pet 1. 19.
lamps were attended and fed ever with more and more oil, and so God by his
Ministers deals still. They attend upon this light, and read and interpret
this word unto Gods people, that they may have light: which holy work and
profitable service should yield them all comfort and favor from the people
again, if it were well considered, as of some, blessed be God, it is. These
lamps and lights were not in the holy place of all, but in the Sanctuary; and
so Aug in illa verba Nemo accendit Lucernam, Math 5. Ista domus, inquit, totus
mundus est, Lucernae accensio verbi est incarnatio, Candelabru^ Crucis est

in the Church militant, the light of teaching and preaching is only
necessary: in Heaven, which was resembled by the most holy place, no such
matter shall be requisite. I am shorter in these things, because I trust the
long and happy use of the Gospel has removed such errors out of our hearts,
and we are not now to be persuaded in these matters. The truth is manifest, and
we are grounded. Popish foilyes may deceive and carry away such as refuse
knowledge, not any others. Blessed be God for his mercies, and ever so
establish and strengthen us with his gracious Spirit, as we may not look back
to Egypt any more, but still, still take comfort in the light of his Word,
which is light indeed, and leave Romish tapers and trinkets to the abusers of
God his offered grace, praying yet for them, that if it may stand with his
blessed will, he would vouchsafe to open their eyes, and to touch their hearts,
that at last they may think, What the whole World will profit a Man if he
loose his Soul, and what an horrible sin it is, to pin that Soul (for
which the Lord Jesus suffered such things) upon any man's sleeue, that refuses
to show the ground of his doctrine out of God his written word, as all true
Teachers ever did.

CHAP. 28.
1 AFter God has spoken of the Tabernacle, and the several things to be
placed and set in the same; now he comes to the persons that should govern,
and, as it were, be the masters in the same, namely the Priests. And first he
calls and chooses the men which he will have, then he adorneth them with fit
and decent apparel for so high a calling. Concerning the first, Cause thou,
says God to Moses, thy brother Aaron to come unto thee, and his sons with
him, from among the children Ver. 1. Moses having not the like dignity,
neither anointed, nor apparelled etc. yet is bidden to call them. Ergo
Sacraments depend not upon men, but upon the commandments of God. See Calvin.
No man ought to take this honor except called as Aaron was. Heb. 5.
of Israel, that he may serve me in the Priests office, I mean Aaron, Nadab,
and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar Aarons Sons. No reasons God here alleges,
why he would have these to be his Priests rather than any others, but simply
commands to choose them, thereby plainly teaching us, that out of his own
will and pleasure, he ever makes choice of his Ministers, not regarding any
dignity or excellency in man, but only moved with his own mercy and favor
first to choose him, and separate him even from the womb to such service, and
after (in time, by degrees, and as he will,) to fit him and frame him to
perform it. The inward calling hereunto, every man rightly entering into the
Ministry feels in his heart and conscience within, which makes him a true
Minister to God and his conscience. The outward is not now by voice, as here
it was, and after in the new Testament, but by the approbatio^ of such, as in
ye Church where we live, have authority committed to them so to approve,
which makes him a Minister be fore men, not to be refused upon every private
man's fancy, before authority have heard the reasons, and allowed them well:
knowing, that his insufficiency or fault makes not the ordinances of God
void to them that rightly use them, but that so to think, is altogether
Anabaptisticall. I refer the willing Read Beza Quest. 14 1.
Reader to my Treatise upon the Lords prayer (the last Petition) for more in
this matter, in the temptation that arises upon conceived wants in Ministers.

2 In this choice again of his Priests, you may note the words, from among the
children of Israel, which are all one as if he had said, men as you are, and
of your acquaintance, not my self, or my Angels, who might fear you with
Majesty and excellency: and surely this both then was, and still is a great
favor. For you remember before, how when God showed himself in ye mount by
those fearful signs, the people cried to Moses, Talk thou cap. 20. 19.
with us, and we will hear: but let not God talk with us, lest we dye; so
unable is man to endure the voice of God. How Angels also have feared men, ye
Scripture is full of testimonies. Wherefore, in great mercy was Moses the^, and
still are the Ministers now, used as means betwixt God and his people, to
speak from him to them, without any terrifiyng fear, a thing to make us more
careful to hear the^, and to use them well, thankfully acknowledging both yt
blessing to our weakness, and the honor done unto our nature, when our own
flesh is in the stead of God unto us, etc.

3 When God had made thus choice of the persons, he pleases to prescribe them
a kind of apparel differing from others, and teaching them and that people
(figuratiuelie) many things, whereof still unto the end of the world there may be
use for profitable instruction. Also thou shall make (says Ver 2.
the Text) holy garments for Aaron thy brother, glorious and beautiful: so to
show, as the marginall Note says, Soto teach ma^s unworthiness to approach
before God in su(...), Nisi exvtus co^muni habitu, ta^gua^ nouus homo prodiret.
his office and function to be glorious and excellent; so to show the Majesty
and glory of the true High Priest Christ Jesus of whom Aaron was a figure; and
so to teach, with what excellent virtues the Priests of God, as with garments,
ought to be adorned and beautified. The shadows of the law I confess are
gone, and Ministers of the word are not now figures of an other Christ to come,
yet still is it both lawful and commendable that they should be distinguished
from other men by a decent and fit at tire, etc.

4 But who shall make these glorious garments for Aaron Ver. 3.
ye Priest? The Text answers: Thou shall speak to all cunning men (or men
wise in heart) whom I have filled with the Spirit of wisdom, that they may make
Aarons garments to consecrate him, etc. By which words two things are taught
us. First, yt in the service of God, nothing ought to be done, but what
proceeds from the direction of God his Wisdom and Will, that being the Rule
and only Rule of his own worship. Men's inventions, without warrant from him,
have no place, be they never so gloriously colored and painted with good intents
and meanings. Secondly, that mechanical Arts, Trades, Occupatio^s, and
ha^dy-crafts, are not found out by men without direction of Gods Spirit: but
God is ye Author of them, as here appears, to ye great comfort of the users
of them well. Many men (otherwise good men) do co^demn Gold smithes, Iewellers,
perfumemakers, Imbroiderers, Arace-weauers, and such like, as though they
served only for vanity and excess, when indeed they be the works of God (I
mean their several skils) and fruits of his Spirit, as here we see. If any
man abuse them, it is the fault of man, not of the skill; and what may not be
abused? The very Heathens have acknowledged these things Inuenta Deorum, the
Inventions of God. Our Books mention Magnificam illa^ Alcist hinis Sybaritae
veste^ quam senior Dionysius pro 120. talentis Carthaginensibns tradidit.
Athenaeus. lib. 12. ca. 16. ex Aristotele. Demetrii ii Maced. Regis ^hlamidem,

strange garments the works of men's hands: Yet none like unto this have been
described, being Exquisitioris artificii, diuinioris inuenti, vtpote a Spiritu
sapientiae coelestis and dignioribus sanctioribusque hominibus tributus. Of a
more exquisite workmanship, and of a more divine invention, given by the spirit
of heavenly wisdom, to more worthy and more holy men. Let us give God the
glory, and make right use of the skill of men.

whereupon it was said, that Saul caused foure-score and five persons, that did

also, being a child, is said to minister before the 1. Sam. 2. 18.

is, say some, a little Ephod) and 19.
brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
offer the yearly sacrifice. David, again, 2. Sam. 6. 14.
danced before the Arc, girded with a linen Ephod. Touching the first kind
of Ephod you see here it is said, that in two Onix stones the Names of the
children of Israel Verse. 9. Verse 10. Verse. 1^.
were to be graven. Six Names of them in one stone and six in the other. And
these stones to be put upon the shoulders of this Ephod, that Aaron might bear
their Names before the Lord, etc. Whereupon Beda thus notes, lib. 3. de
Tabernac. cap. 4. Tres ob causas Aaron nomina Patriarcharum in humeris portasse
sicut in pectore. Primo, vt ipse fidem vitamque Patriarcharum meminisset
imitari. Secundo, vt 12. tribuum quae de his natae sunt, in orationibus and
sacrificijs memor existeret. Tertio, vt idem Pop. scripta in vest Praesulis
sui patrum nomina videns, curaret sedulo ne ab illorum meritis desciscens, ad
errorum contagia declinaret. For three causes Aaron did bear the names of the
Patriarchs upon his shoulders as upon his breast. First, that he might
remember to imitate the faith and life of the Patriarchs. Secondly, that he
might remember both in his prayers and sacrifices the twelve Tribes whereof the
Patriarchs sprang. Thirdly, that the people seeing the Names of their Fathers
written in the garment of their high Priest, might diligently take heed that
they fell not from the virtue which was in them, unto vice and error. Mysticus
vsus, vt signaret Christum humeris suis portantem, instar Pastoris, oues
perditas etc. A mystical use of this Ephod with these Names, to represent or
shadow Christ like a Shepeheard bearing his sheep upon his shoulders, etc. The
second is the Breastplate, from the fifteenth verse to the thirty one. In
which brestplate was Vrim and Thummim, Vnde certior factus est Sacerdos de Dei

priest was informed of Gods will toward himself and the people, as often as
counsel was sought, and an answer to be given. How this was done, several
men are of several minds. Josephus says, Tantus erat splendour in 12.
lapidibus quos suprapectus Pontifex portabat, vt omni fieret multitudini
manifestum, Eorum auxil^is adesse Deum. li. 13. Antiq. cap. 12. The twelve
stones which the Priest did bear upon his breast did so shine and glister,
that the whole multitude might observe Gods favor to them, Suidas in the word
Ephod (if I forget not, having not the book now with me) makes mention of an
Adamant in the Ephod, which the priest putting on when he sought counsel of
God, and putting his hands under it, Cum detraheret, deprehe^debat eas quasi
color quoda^ infectas, When he drew them out, he did find them as it were
stained and colored with a certain color. Et si Deus petitioni annuebat,
confestim micabat lapis Adamas; sin negabat, nihil ad proprium and pristinum
lapidis fulgore^ accedebat: quod si Deus voluit pop. obijcere gladio, lapis
reddebatur cruentus; si autem imminebat mors, lapis fiebat niger. And if God
would grant the petition, presently the Adamant stone would glister
extraordinarily, but if God denied it, then the Adamant remained still without
any change in his color and shining: if God would deliver the people to the
sword, then the stone was made bloody; and in case of death, it would show
black. The like things Epiphanius has, speaking of the Adamant which the
High Priest did bear and wear. August. was of an other mind, and believed
not those things. Quest. 117. in Exodus And so you see in a matter obscure, men's
guesses. Diverse others Virtus est Theologica rerum arcanarum ignorantia. What

I might repeat, but let it be a virtue sometimes to profess ignorance. The
third is the Robe, from the 31. verse to the 36. The fourth is the golden plate
upon his forhead or miter, whereon was graven HOLINESS TO THE LORD, from ye 36.
verse. to the 39. The fifth is the broidred coat, verse. 39. And the sixth, the
girdle, in the same verse. Of every parcel to stand and search out particular
significations, should be more curious than profitable. Diverse have done so,
but with little contentment to their Reader, because their assertions are but
guesses and very uncertain. The Names graven in the Onix stones might teach
both the Priest to remember the people, and the people to rest in the judgment
of the priest. The bearing See Beda before, Mysticus vsus, etc.

contempt of Christian Magistrates in disobeying their good laws be life? Let
it sink and he religiously thought upon.

CHAP. 29.
1 Observe how the Lord proceeds. First, he will have a Church, Then
Priests to serve in the same, Thirdly, comely and fit apparel for them, and
Now a very reverent and solemn consecration of them, to and for their holy
office: of which Consecration, as before of the apparel, there is much good
to be taken by due consideration of it. For, it served greatly to the honoring
and gracing of this high Function in the eyes of the people, who are much
moved with outward Ceremonies. It served (being no idle show) for the procuring
of Gods blessing upon them. For the Lord graciously wrought in their hearts by
his holy Spirit, what was outwardly shadowed by Ceremony. The anointing oil

2. Cor. 3. We are not the ministers of the letter, but of the Spirit, that is,
by our preaching, the Holy Ghost is not only effectual, but indeed truly
given to them that believe. By oil the Holy Ghost was signified for the
fitness of resemblance betwixt them. For the oil has igneam vim, a force of

fire, and so has the Holy Ghost; Oil penetrateth and pearceth inwardly, so
does the Holy Ghost; Oil cherishes and comfort, so does the Holy Ghost;
and Oil confirms and strengthens, and so does the Holy Ghost. It served to
shadow out the anointing of Christ with the holy Spirit without measure. The
Spirit of the Lord has anointed me to preach, and so forth. Esaias. 61. God,
even thy God has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows,
Psalm. 45. But to justify Popish oyling, or necessary use of it now by this
example, were to reduce the Ceremonial law again, and not to be Christians,
but Jews. Consecration again in this sort, notably ^al. 4. 3.
served to seal up to their consciences their vocation to this office, that in
all troubles and afflictions they might be cheered with it, they had not thrust
themselves in, but of God were appointed, and that God never would forsake
either them, or his own ordinance. In the belief whereof, let us ever
reverence and defend the ministry, use the blessing of it with true
thankfulness to the Author, and beseech him heartely, that in his tender
mercy to his poor lambs, he would continually send faithful laborers into
his harvest. In this faith again let us cheer up our hearts, when we see the
Church shaken with rage of worldly troubles, so that many fall away in
weakness. For if the Lord will ever have a ministry greater or less: surely
he will also ever have a flock for those true Pastors to employ their gifts
upon, greater or less. Think of the Speech in Amos often. Behold the eyes of
the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, Amos. 9. 8.
and I will destroy it clean out of the earth. Nevertheless I will not
utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says the Lord. And let faithful Ministers
of God lay up in their hearts that example of Alexander the Great, to Iaddus
the High Priest and his company at Jerusalem, with other such like testimonies
of Gods power, when he pleases to use it. This Great conqueror of the world
Alexander having besieged seven months the strong City of Tyrus, sent to his
near neighbors the jews, for some men and help to besent unto him but they
by pretense of gratitude to the kings of Persia, who had ever been kind (they
said) to them, denied him any aid. Whereupon entering into a great rage
against them, as soon as he had gotten the City, be gathered all his forces
to go against Jerusalem to be avenged of them, which when Iaddus the High
priest understood, he put on all his Priestly attire, and took the rest of his
company also with him, and went to meet Alexander in the way, desiring peace
at his hands. Whom when Alexander saw (now see the finger of God with his
Minister) he presently alighted down from his horse, and falling upon his
knees to the High Priest, granted him and all the Jews their desired peace. A
most admitable sight in such a warrior, such an Emperor, such a powerful
Prince as made all the world to stoop, himself so to humble his body to an
unarmed Priest, unknown to him, and never seen before. His chief
Counselors Parmenio, Clitus, and others, were amazed at it, and asking a
reason, Alexander told them, God had showed him in a dream the very same man
so attired, and so accompanied, and promised him victory; which now
remembering, and having prevailed against Tyrus, in reverence of that vision,
and hope of further success according to the promise, he held it most fit to
behave himself in such sort. So was the case altered by an Omnipotent God,
striking even that Lion with a reverence of his Minister, and after great gifts
given to the College, he departed peaceably into Egypt. Not an unlike
reverence did God strike into the heart of Herod of John Baptist, the Text
saying, Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and a holy, and
reverenced him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him
gladly. Surely, the Lord is the same both in power and mercy, if we will be
true Pastors and Ministers to him and his people. Well may the mountains be
moved, and the lesser hills tremble, but his mercy shall never depart from
his Ministers, nor the Covenant of his peace be altered. Only, only let us
look to our part of the Covenant and perform it, not loytering, but
laboring, and that in such sort, as makes most for the edifying of our
flock. Let not them gape upon us, and catch nothing, our words passing like a
stream for our praise, not for their profit. etc.

2 The Verse. 12. Vide Cyril. lib. 11. super Joan. cap. 56.
blood was to be put upon the horns of the Altar, says the 12. verse; that so
might be shadowed, how the preaching of the Gospel concerning the blood and
passion of Christ, should be published and sounded through the four corners of
the world, even over the whole earth. And all the rest of the blood thou shall
power at the foot of the Altar: So noting again how the blood of Christ
though in it self sufficient for all, yet becomes not helpful to all, but
is unprofitably powered out for many, as this here was, at the foot of the
Altar, through their own unbelief and wicked hardness of heart, treading under
their feet that holy atonement. Hebrews. 10. The Ver. 13. and 22.
fat was to be offered unto the Lord, even the fat that covered the inwardes
and the kall that is on the liver, and the two kidneyes etc. That so men

to give unto God their best service and duty, most thankfully ever
confessing, that all fatnes, that is, all comfort and prosperity and joy
comes from him as from the fountain, and it is due to him as his own, from
all men. But O change of men's hearts in these days from this persuasion and
duty! When the very worst is thought good enough for God, our worst corn,
our worst Calfe, our worst Lamb, and too often neither good nor bad shall God
have of us. Is this to burn the fat upon the Altar unto the Lord? Then for
thankful feeling as given of GOD, it is also far from us, (many I mean,)
as we are near to consuming vengeance for the same. We sacrifice praise to our
purses, to our wits, to our friends, and to any thing rather than to God. So
that I fear the profane Atheism and wickedness of Ajax and Timotheus, two
Captains of Athens, steals into the hearts of men in these days. Of which
Ajax it is written, that when he went to the Trojan war, his careful father
Telamon advised him to behave himself manfully, and to be valiant in
attempting great things, honorable and praiseworthie, adiutore Deo, God being
his helper. But Ajax like a mad Athiest answered, Timidis and ignauis opus esse
auxilio Diuino, That fearful and cowardly men had need of Gods help, he would
attain to victory without God. Which odious and damnable Speech of an
arrogant wretch, Sophocles says was punished with burning torches of Furies,
whereby he was bereaved of his wits, and Ardentibus t^dis Furiarum.
so mad, slew himself. A fit end for such a monster. Of Timotheus the other
Athiest thus we read: That when certain envious persons spiting his success,
made and spread abroad certain pictures or fables, wherein they portrayed
Fortune, hanging nets about such Cities as he had subdued, he sleeping fast and
doing nothing, whereby they maliciously sought to rob him of his due praise,
and to give it to Fortune, he unadvisedly, out of a proud and profane heart,
brake out into these words: Ego feci, non Fortuua, These things, I tell you,
my self have done, not Fortune. After which words he never had success in
any service more. Understand by Fortune, GOD, as the Fortuna est, cum Deus
operatur occulte.
better Heathens did, and the wickedness will appear better of this Speech. Let
us then learn to burn the fat unto God, that is, ever and ever to
acknowledge, that all our prosperity and success, all our comfort and good is
from him, and him only, without whom we can do nothing.

3 But the flesh of the Calfe, and his skin, and his Verse. 14.
doung, shall thou burn with fire without the host: It is a sin offering. By
these things was represented the Old man subject to sin and curse, which
has no place in the Church, but must be carried out of the host: flesh and
blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Others apply it to Christ, as a
figure of him, and aleadge the Apostles words to the Hebrews, where he says,
The bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into Iebr. 13. 11.
the Holy place by the High Priest for sin, are burnt without the camp.
Therefore even Jesus, that he might sanctify 12
the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. As if he should
have said, the carrying out of these things out of the host, and burning of
them there, was a notable figure how Christ should suffer (being an offering
for sin) without the gate, not in the City. The use whereof follows in the
same place, Let us therefore go forth to him out of the camp, bearing his
reproach. See your Marginall Note in your Bible upon the words.

4 Going from this sacrifice to the next, of the Ram, verse. 17. he says,
Thou shall cut the Ram in pieces, etc. Verse. 17. Diuisione partium (...)
verbi veritatis proculdubio adumbrata est: Intestinorum ablutione, interiorum
omniu^ purgatio: Holocausto ipso, (...) sieve integra corporum animorumque

It was not lawful to tear and rend the sacrifices, but there was used a
cunning and right cutting of every part whole up, as it grew upon the body,
both for reverence of the sacrifice, and to the end every part appointed by GOD
to an use, might truly, and rightly, and wholly be so used. From this cutting
and dividing the Apostle drew his word (...), 2. Tim. 2. 15, To divide the
word aright. Not to rend and tear, not to wring and wrest to our fancies the
holy Sayings of God, not to bring a sense, but to take a sense, and to keep
the purity of doctrine, the soundnes of truth, the proportion of Faith,
teaching, conuincing, correcting, and instructing in righteousness rightly, that
the man of God may be absolute, being made perfect to all good works. How men
have failed in this, who so reads the Monuments of times may see to his
grief. In Tertullian and others how the Valentinian Heretics and many more
abused the holy Scriptures by their interpretations, every man may read.
Origin was learned, yet how ill he divided holy Writ by forced and conceyted
allegories, it is pitiful to see. Thus may you go over older times. And for
these later times our Romish teachers have exceeded all that went before them
in this fault, as may be showed When I come to Leuiticus.
by many miserable expositions when time shall so require.

5 Thou shall kill the Ram, and take of his blood and Verse. 20.
put it upon the lap of Aarons ear, and upon the lap of the right ear of his
sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of the
right foot, etc. By the ear is noted obedience; whereupon the servant that
would still continue with his master, was put to the post of his masters house,
and bored in the ear, in token of perpetual service and obedience: So by this
figure the Lord would shadow out yt the Priests (from whom others should draw
example) should themselves be obedient to his word in all things, and first
hear, and then teach: Obedience was ever acceptable and pleasing to God.
Sacrifice and meat offerings, says the Psalm, thou would not have but mine
ear thou have opened. Psalm. 406.
Has the Lord as great pleasure in burnt offerings and 1. Sam. 15. 12.
sacrifices, as when his voice is obeyed? Behold, to obey is better than
sacrifice, and to hearken is better than the fat of Rams etc. Especially in
them that call upon others to obey, obedience must needs be looked for, and
the want severely punished. Alij, Significatum est omnem piorum ministrorum

The right ear is chosen, to shadow a right hearing of the word for
amendment of life, and not a left for confirmation of error and further
obstinacy against the Lord, as many do hear it. The Thumb of the hand is
touched with blood, to teach that we must not only be hearers, but dooers of
the word, joining works to faith, and holy life to a sound belief. For the
kingdom of God stands not in word, but in power. The right Thumb not the
left, to shadow out, that we may not deceive our selves in our works, and do
what seems good in our own eyes, thinking to please GOD with our good and
fair intents, but our works must be right, commanded by God, not invented by
us. For want of which due consideration, O, how many are deceived, and weary
themselves in doing what God never will accept or reward? Woe be to the
Teachers, that for their own advantage have thus abused Gods poor people the
work of his hands, the price of his dear Sons blood. The Thumb is touched,
but it is the right Thumb, and both by figure and plain testimonies, the
Scriptures are manifest in this point. To the like end, was the great Toe of
their right foot also sprinkled with blood, that they might so remember to
walk worthy of their vocation. And usually, by the foot, in Scripture, is
both action and affection noted. Their feet are swift to shed blood, that is,
their actions are cruel and tyrannical. My feet had almost slipped, says
David, meaning both action and affection. Look to thy foot when thou enterest
into the house of God, that is, to thy mind, intent and affection. Lastly,
both Aaron and his garments, and his sons, and their garments were sprinkled
with blood: To teach, that he and Ver. 21.
all his service and intercession for the people, was only in his blood
acceptable, who should shed his blood for mankind, the true Aaron and High
priest, Christ Jesus.

6 The breast and the shoulder were the Priests part, as you Ver. 26 and 27.
see, allotted by God to them for their maintenance, yet not without some
figurative resemblance: for the breast is often used to signify wisdom, and the
shoulders to note strength in bearing. So by these parts given to ye Priests,
God would shadow how ye priests ought ever, both in wisdom and judgment, and
in bearing and enduring ye many difficulties of their own function, and all
other crosses whatsoever, go before the people, and be examples to them of
comfort and courage, of counsel and good advise in all things. Great uses are
then of Ministers, if people had eyes to see them, and hearts wisely to consider
them, that with thankfulness both to God and his instruments, they might righly
use Gods goodness provided for them.

7 The head was cast away, not without an excellent figure. For thereby was
signified, that in matters divine and heavenly, we must cast away our own
heads and wits, as not able to attain to such depth, and pray with the Prophet
David, Open mine eyes O Lord, that Psalm. 119 18.
I may behold the wonderful things in thy law. The natural man, says Saint
Paul, understands not the things that belong to God, neither can he, for
they are foolishness unto him. This meditation is a notable stay when we
cannot understand, and so are tempted to think it false and absurd, etc.

8 Verse. 29. The garments of the inferior priest were not so rich and glorious,
is the garments of the High Priest. Quaeres discrime^ adu^brare debuit inter
Christum qui sine mensura consecutus est Sp. Sanc. and alios Sanctos qui de
eius acceperunt plenitudine, and quidem (...) nec non inter Sanctos ipsos, quos
donoru^ varietas dispares facit, vnoquoque proprium ferente donum a Deo. See.
Ioh. 3 ver. 34. John. 1. 16. 1. Cor. 7. 17.
And the holy garments which appertain to Aaron, shall be his sons after
him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrate therein, etc. The same
garments continued, although the Priest by mortality (being a natural man)
changed: and so was signified, that our High priest (not mere man, but God and
man) is one, and his righteousness (our blessed garment) remains to Father,
Son, and sons son, to the worlds end, in them that fear him, and by a
true faith believe in him. Again (by the way) we may note that by Gods law
the high priest was not buried in his Robes and Pontificalibus, as now
(forsooth) Bishops be among apish imitators of these Jews Ceremonies, a toy
taken up without reason, unless this may be reason, because being dead they
mean to discharge that duty of their place, which alive they never made any
conscience of.

9 Aaron and his Sons shall eat the flesh of the Ram, and so forth. But
a stranger shall Verse. 32. Verse 33.
not eat thereof, because they are Holy things. When any Sacrifice was
effected in this sort, the bringer or owner, and the Priests did eat part,
and so were as Gods guestes invited of him to a holy feast; which that it might
be with more reverence and spiritual presence, all things were done in the Holy
place, the meat soden and eaten, etc: so a difference made betwixt that and
their ordinary diet at other times, their minds drawn to the meditation of
such mysteries, and they present rather at a Sacrament than an earthly repast.
No profane person was admitted, but only such as were of the family of God,
and yet in our days they that will seem most religious teach and strive to
maintain, that wicked and profane persons may as well eat the body, and
drink the blood of Christ, as the godly may; and to that end teach a gross
real presence of material flesh and blood by transubstantiation. Nothing will
draw them from this madness, neither the figures of the law nor the
plainness of the Gospel, but headlong to hell they will run with it against
Scripture, Fathers, Reason, and whatsoever ought to persuade wise men. The late
beginning of this cursed error they read and see as well as we, Tertullians
Rule they acknowledge with us, That truth is first, and that which was first,
is truth; and yet they fail and still will fail to grant and make the
conclusion. Their hands are red in their poor brethrens blood, who have
auowed truth and chosen rather to loose life than to forsake truth: what
remains but searefull confusion, without repentance? God give them eyes.

10 Now, if ought of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread remain
unto the morning, then thou Verse. 34.
shall burn the rest with fire. It shall not be eaten because it is an holy
thing. First, this was done for more reverence of those holy Sacrifices, lest
by reservation, either any loathing might have grown from worms and such
like, or neglect and contempt, by casting it away or loosing it. Secondly, by
this shadowed, that God will have no part of his worship put over till an other
day, but cheerfully ever will he be served without delays. Cras, Cras, To
morrow, to morrow, is the noice of a Crow, not the voice of a Christian. But To
day if you will hear his voice, hearden not your Hebr. 3. 15. 13
hearts; And, while it is called To day, exhort one another, with many other
such Speeches in the Scripture are we stirred up to take present time, and not
to delay. Thirdly, by this denying them to keep any, the Lord would prevent
superstition by abusing those parts kept contrary to Gods will: as, to heal
diseases, to keep away ill Spirits, to hang them about their neck, to swear
by them, and such like, as at this day is to be seen in the Popish Church by
reservation of the Sacrament. Satan was ready then, had not this law
prevented him; but after, in the time of the Gospel, he prevailed, and even
in Tertulians time were crept in foul abuses growing to adoration of the bread.

11 These things thus passed over belonging to the consecration of the
Priests, your Chapter comes to Verse. 39.
the Sacrifice which was continual. A Lamb in the Morning, and a Lamb at
Even, with what further is specified in the Text. By which kind of Sacrifice
notably the Lamb Christ Jesus was figured, which takes away sins of the
world. The manner how the Lamb resembled Christ, you may read in the 12.
Chapter of this Book, where Speech was of the Paschall Lamb, and thither I
refer you. Oil and Wine were added to this Verse. 40.
sacrifice, to signify, that unto these holy exercises of the law, they
should bring with them faith and repentance which should make the taste of them
good, as oil and wine does the Sacrifice. For without these two, what savor
or relish could God have of them? Sorrow for my sin, and faith in him that
has redeemed me from my sin, is all the camfort God can conceive in me; and
therefore beware of doing any duty to him without these two, lest the Lord
say, I have no pleasure in them. Oil and wine then with that Legal Sacrifice,
and faith and repentance with our spiritual duties and Sacrifices, agree well.

As all Sacrifices then led unto Christ, so did this daily Sacrifice of the two
Lambs Morning and Evening, most plainly; and therefore after Christ was
exhibited in the flesh, accordingly these legal Sacrifices had their end all,
and by name this, whereof read the praediction of Daniel in his ninth Chapter.
Yet nevertheless the Synagogue of Antichrist is not ashamed hereupon to build
that filthy Idol of their Mass, saying, that all they are Antichrists which
take away their daily Sacrifice of their Mass. But their mouths are no
slander. The truth we hold, and GOD ever make us hold it, both in this
point, and the rest. In this point we say thus, that this daily sactifice of
the Lambs, figured Christ; he is come, and therefore no longer to be figured
as to come. But these Lambs are gone, and he the true Lamb remains, once
offered upon the cross, but daily saving us from our sins, upon our true
repentance and faith in him. He is our daily sacrifice and continual Mediator.
And who so takes him away, he is Antichrist, ware he thrice three Crowns
upon his head: But that does the Man of Rome and his Succession, who teach that
remission of sins may be obtained by other means than by him only. We
have none but him, yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever. His blessed
Sacrament he has left us, to remember us of his work wrought for us, and we
so use it to thanksgiving, and not as a sacrifice for quick and dead, as
they do. Judge betwixt us, good Christian Reader, and the Lord give thee
wisdom in all things.

13 Finally, the Lord promises, they using these his appointments rightly, he
will dwell among them, and Ver. 45.
will be their God. It is not hard in prosperity to think God is present and
cares for us, being indeed, as Philosophers could say, the Cause of all good
things in Nature. Deus est men's aterna, causa boni in Natura. Plato.
But when the cloudie day of adversity comes, and we are overwhelmed (as it
were) with perilles and crosses, then is it a gracious strength to think and
believe so steadfastly. Cato a Wiseman, as long as Pompei stood and flourished,
defended stoutlye a Providence, but when he fled into Egypt, and was slain of
a base fellow, and lay upon the shore without any honor of burial, when Cato
himself also was beset with Caesar's army, then in this mist of misery, he fell
from his former doctrine, turning his tale as if there were no Providence at
all, but every thing went by Hap, and saying, There was a great darkness in
Divine things, seeing Pompei, who had many times prospered and had good
success in ill causes, now was overthrown in a good cause most misearably,
namely, in the defense of his country. Too many taste of this weakness,
which know more than Cato knew; and therefore in the day of comfort and fair
Sunneshine, it is good to gather strength against a change; And to remember
such Speeches as this of God to his Church, and to his people. I WILL DVVELL
AMONG YOU, AND WILL BE YOUR GOD. He is true in this promise as well in foul
weather as in fair, and we must be assured of it. Other like Speeches there
are many. If any man love me (says Christ) He will keep my word, and my
Father will love him, and we will come to him, and dwell with him. The Psalms
are full of such comforts. The Lord is near unto all them that are of
atroubled spirit, the LORD is near to all them that call upon him faithfully.
It is a memorable place, where Esaias the Prophet bringeth-in GOD saying, Ego
DEVS habito cum contrito et humili SPIRITV, vt erigam SPIRITVM humilium, et
viuificem CORDA contritorum, I the Lord will dwell with the contrite and humble
spirit, that I may raise up the spirit of the humble, and revive the hearts of
them that are contrite. It is the manner of sinful men to insult over them
that are in affliction, and to go over where the wall is broken, but with our
sweet and gracious God it is far otherwise, of whom the Prophet Hosea speaks
thus, Quomodo affligam te, Israel? aut quomodo puniam te, O Ephraim? Just
quidem te delerem, sed conuersum est in me cor meum. Exarsit comiseratio mea,
non faciam furorem irae meae, quia Deus ego sum, et non Homo, etc. How should I
afflict thee, O Israel? Or how should I punish thee, O Ephraim? Justly might I
destroy thee, but my heart is turned within me, and my mercy burns toward
thee, I will not execute the fury of my wrath, because I am God and not man,
etc. Thus, thus let us gather comfort, and in all storms look unto him, and
hold fast by him: he is the same and no Changling, good, before, good now, and
good ever: Chastise us he may for our good, but forsake us to our harm he will
never. Fire tries gold, and affliction the godly. Abraham even past hope, yet
believed under hope, and so do you. If the Lord should kill me, Romans 4. 18.
says Job, yet will I put my trust in him. Ask since the world was made, who
ever claue fast unto him, and was Job. 13. 15.
shaken of by him? No says Christ, whom I love, to the end I love, and he that
comes unto me, I never cast away. God for his Sons sake strengthen our hearts
in all our ways, and give us assurance immovable, that he dwells with us
according to this promise.

Amen, Amen.
CHAP. 30.
1. THe Holy Ghost having thus passed over the ordinary Sacraments of the law
in the 25. and 26 Chapters, the observations belonging thereunto in the 27. and
28. the Sacrifices in this last 29. Chapter: Now, in this 30. he lays down
such things as belonged to the Ministering of all the former; And by name notes
5. sorts of holy instruments. whereof the first belongs to Gods service, the
second to the whole Ministry, to wit, the money for the maintenance of the
Sanctuary: the third is the Lauer; the fourth is the holy Oil; the fifth is
the Incense and the manner to make it. Touching the Altar of Incense, if you
mark the Text, you shall see in the first verse the matter of it, Sittim wood:
in the second Ver. 1. Ver. 2. Ver. 3.
verse the form of it, thus long, thus broad: in the third verse, the adorning
of it, it was ouerlaide with gold: in the fourth and fifth verses, the helps to
carry it, as rings, Ver. 4 and 5. Ver. 6. Ver. 7 and 8.
bars etc, in the sixth verse, the place for it, to wit, before the veil
near the Arc, in the seventh and eight verses, the use of it, to burn
sweet perfume upon it Morning and Evening: in the ninth verse the holiness of
it, in that Ver. 9.
no strange incense might be offered upon it: And lastly, in the tenth verse, a
peculiar reconciliation by sacrifice to Ver. 10.
be made upon the horns of this Altar, once in a year by blood.

2. Concerning the mystery and meaning of all these, thus you may safely
meditate of them. The Altar of incense was of Wood and covered with gold,
figuring so, Christ in both his Natures, the Wood his humanity, the gold his
Divinity, the Deity yielding glory and Majesty to his Manhood, as the gold
adorned and beautifyed the Shittim wood. You remember an other Altar in the
Court of the TABERNACLE whereupon all the Sacrifices were offered, and that was
of Brass, now this ouerlaide thus with gold, and as as it were, of gold. Both
of them shadowed out Christ, and this difference of matter, happily the
difference of his estate, when humbled here on earth, and when glorified now in
Heaven. The brazen Altar standing in the Court, might note his mean account in
the World before his passion. This golden Altar standing in the Sanctuary,
might note his Glory and Majesty in Heaven after his ascension. For the
Sanctuary is a figure of Heaven. The form of this Altar square, significantly
represented the firm stabilitie of Christ who cannot be overthrown. The
Crown about it, the regal dignity of Christ, and of all those that are
ingrafted to him. For we are kings, and Priests in him and by him. Peter
says, A royal Apoc. (...). 10. 1. Pet. 2. 9.
Priesthood etc. The horns of the four corners, the power and force of our
heavenly Altar CHRIST dispersed over the World to the East, West, North, and
South, in such as will believe in HIM. The sweet Incense generally noted all
duties and services which the people of GOD do to him by his appointment and
warrant, and that they smell sweet before him as the Incense, and are accepted
of him. But particularly the Prayers of GODS faithful for so DAVID in his
PSALM expounded it, saying, Let my prayer come before thee as the Incense, and
the lifting Ps. 141. 2.
up of my hands be as an Evening SACRIFICE. And so the Custom noted, which was
That whilst the Luke. 1. 10.
Priest was burning this Incense within in the Sanctuary, the people were
without at prayer. Also in the Revelation thus you read, That the twenty
four Elders Apoc. 5. 8.
fell down before the Lamb, having Harpes and Golden Viols full of odours
which are the PRAYERS OF THE SAINTS. Again in the eight Chapter. Apoc. 8. 3.
An other Angel stood before the Altar, having a golden censer, and much
odours was given unto him, that he should offer with the prayers of all Saints
upon the golden ALTAR which is before the throne. This resemblance was very
fit, if you mark it, and showed the Nature of true prayer. For what does the
smoke of ye incense but ascend upward and scatter it self abroad in the air
every way? so showing, that the Faithful Prayers of true Believers ascend up
to Heaven, and the profit of them disperseth it self far and wide over the
World, the members of the true CHVRCH praying one for an other through out the
World, and being profited one of another by natural prayer, although they
live in several countries, and never know or see one another. The burning of
this Incense upon the ALTAR which was a figure of Christ, shadowed out that in
Christ and for Christ only our prayers are of force with God; and therefore by
him they ought to be offered to GOD, he himself telling us, That No man
comes to the FATHER, but by HIM. and whatsoever we ask the FATHER in his
Name, we shall receive it. No Saint, nor Creature was shadowed by the ALTAR of
Incense, but Christ; and therefore let them take heed yt will pray to others,
and make others ye prese^ters of their desires to God. Again, no strange
Incense was to be offered upon this ALTAR, but Prayers either to others than to
GOD in the Name of Christ, or for unlawful and unfit things, are strange
Incense, and therefore not to be offered to GOD. The LORD by the Prophets much
complained of Incense offered without Faith in those days, and prayers without
faith, are as odious. Lip-labor, and much babbling by number upon Beads for to
keep ye reckoning, is not ince^se yt pleases God. It was forbiden that any
man should make such Incense as this in the law was, and that also shadowed,
that no creature is to be prayed unto, but this honor reserved only to God.
Every Morning and Evening this Incense was offered up, that so might be
shadowed the continual use and exercise of prayer, both when we rise, and
when we go to rest. The Apostle therefore commands true CHRISTIANS to pray
continually. Think with your self, I 1 These. 5. 17.
pray you, as you read this Note, what fearful negligence is in this
behalf, and for your own part never be guilty in it, but let the Lord smell
your sweet odours Morning and Evening at least, sent up to him, which many
ways he assures you are to him acceptable, and to your self most profitable.
Last of all, Note it, yt this Altar of ince^se was once in a year sprinkled
with the blood of the expiatorie sacrifice, to signify so, that no prayer
avails any thing with God, unless he or she that prays be reconciled to
God in the blood of his Son Jesus Christ the true sacrifice of
reconciliation. So have you this figure of the law every way leading your
prayers to God only in the Name and mediation of his Son Christ, and all
other ways and means condemned: which, if you be the Lords, shall so sink in
your heart, as all the Inchanters of Egypt shall not remove you from yemaner of
praying. You may follow the meditation further, if you please.

3 Afterward, the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Ver. 11. and. 12. etc.
when thou take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then
they shall give every man a redemption of his life, etc. Unto the seventeenth
verse. This is the second part or point of this Chapter, concerning a Tribute
raised upon the people of Israel, toward the maintetenance of the Tabernacle,
and what belonged thereunto, and diverse things we may observe in it. First,
that to number people in a Land is lawful, And if you think of David, why he
was plagued for so doing, surely it was not for that he numbered the people,
but because he did it in a pride and confidence in man's strength, which indeed
is very odious before God, all victory and prosperity resting in the help of
God, and not in man, or horse, or any humane means. These are things men may
use, not trusting in them, but in the Lord: but to slip from the Lord in any
measure or degree, to a confidence and vain hope in these, is most sinful.
The Hebrews say, David offended because he numbered the people, and took not
this Tribute here spoken of, according to the law. But the former opinion is
more like. Among the Romans we read one Seruius ^ullus first ordained this
mustering or numbering of the people, that so he might know the number of able
men for the wars, the worth of them in worldly estate, and so impose a
Tribute accordingly, with other such ends and uses. But here neither wealth,
nor other such ends were respected, rather obedience was aimed at, and that
they should profess themselves thus Gods people, him their King, and
themselves his tributaries, and so be strongly comforted ever in his protection
and defense of them, whose power no worldly Princes could match. It was also a
redemption of their lives, or a matter expiatorie to them, that there should be
no plague among them when they were numbered. How often this was, is not
mentioned, whether every year, or every five year, as it was in Rome. How
Moses numbered, you Number. 1. 2. etc.
may read in the Book of Numbers at large. From twenty years old and upward
they were numbered, and what they gave, you read in the Text. That the poor
paid Math. 17. 27. A piece of twenty pence for himself and Peter.
as much as the rich, and the rich no more than the poor, it is worthy noting.
It was a personal tribute, imposed to testify obedience to God, and therefore
equally was paid, to signify that God is no respecter of persons, but ye
poor are as dear and acceptable unto him (doing his will) as the rich, we
are all wholly the Lords, the price of our redemption is one, the precious
blood of the immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus. In worldly matters the rich may go
before us, but in matters belonging unto God his service and worship we ought
to be as forward as the rich etc. Again, here may you think, what an
acceptable thing to God it is, to preserve ye Ministry and to give to the
Church; on ye contrary side, how odious to spoil the Ministry and to take
from the Church, what men and women of better hearts than we have, gave to the
Church. You see how this was not posted over to Princes and great men only, but
even private men also must join in this. For if he be borne to inherit
Heaven, he must think himself borne to maintain the means that lead us
unto Heaven. Our sheep and cattle we provide for, because they labor for us
and feed us, what hearts then should we have to see them comfortably
maintained, that labor for us in a far higher sort, and feed us with a much
better food. They draw body and soul out of the pit of death, and lead them
both to eternal comfort. Of this tribute again was the question moved in
Christ his time. For the Romans having conquered, took this tribute to
themselves, which was here appointed for God: and this offended much the Jews:
but Christ knowing these legal types were ended by his coming, bad them give
Caesar that which was his, and God that which was his. Himself also paying for
himself and Peter.

Lauer (spoken of in the next place) wherein the Priests washed their hands
and feet when they went to perform their office, plainly resembled how with
unwashed hands we ought not to meddle with holy things, that is, with profane
hearts, tongues, or minds, as they do, that read the Scriptures not to guide
their lives, but to maintain table-discourses, and with unholy tongs speak
most unholy and false things, drawing the Scriptures to their judgments, and
not framing their judgments according to the Scripture. The Pharisees were
great washers of the outside, and still left the inside very foul. Such
washers still the world is full of. But as Christ rebuked that superstitious
folly in them; so he will judge sharply this hypocritical mockery in us.
These washings again in the law had a ^urther reach, being used in Faith,
even unto the inward washing of the spirit, whereof they were true Sacraments
to the believers. So you see by David in his Psalm, Wash me O Lord and I shall
be clean, that is, inwardly, inwardly, O Lord, by thy blessed Spirit, from my
foul transgression and fall. So you may see by the Prophet Esaias 1. 16. and 17.
Wash you make you clean: (how?) it follows, take you away the evil works
from before mine eyes, cease to do evil. Learn to do well, seek judgment,
relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless, and defend the Widow. This
washing was shadowed by the other, and wrought by Gods holy Spirit as verily in
all true believers, as they truly were partakers and users of outward washings.
So the 15. Psalm also, v. 1. Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle? even he
that is thus washed and made clean. Read it over your self.

5. In the 23. v. it follows thus, Take unto thee principal spices, of the
most pure myrrh so much, of sweet Cynamon so much, etc. Thou shall make
hereof the holy anointing oil, even a most precious ointment, wherewith all
things appertaining to the Tabernacle were anointed, and the Priests, ver. 25.
etc. No man might use this for his private use, etc. This holy and most
excellent oil was a figure of the Holy Ghost, without whom nothing is pure,
nor sweet. All things were anointed therefore, Priest, Arc, Table,
Candelsticke etc. to teach that all the exercises of Religion are utterly
unprofitable without the inward working of the Holy Ghost in our hearts, by who^
only we are made partakers of Christ his holiness, Private uses it might not
serve unto, nor be for strangers, to maintain ye reputation of it, and to keep
under ye proud desires of corrupt minds. The note in your margin concerning
stra^ gers may be looked on. Of ye perfume the like is said, and happy were
men, if all these could make them see, how things belonging to Gods service
ought not to be transferred to private uses. The Romish Church has taken upon
her, and still does, to imitate this ointment and perfume; and therefore their
Priests show, that they are rather Priests of the law, than Ministers of the
Gospel, and by continuing these Ceremonies of the law, they (as much as they
can) labor to teach, that Christ (the end of these Ceremonies) is not yet
come. What a stir they make in imitatio^ of this oil, who is able to repeat
without laughter? The mitred Bishop he charms the oil with certain words
whispered and muttered over it; then he breaths upon it with his unsweet
breath. Twelve Priests stand by ready, which (one after one) come and breath
into the cup where the oil is. Then the Bishop adds more Charming prayers
and makes mention of Moses and Aaron, of David, Kings, Prophets, and Martys,
desiring that this Chrisme or ointment when it is made, may have power to
co^fer upon men such gifts as they in their times were partakers of. With ye
oil he mingleth a quantity of balm, and then prays again. At length, a
Deacon takes away the cloth that covered ye cup, and then bowing himself, he
says, All hayle holy Chrisme, three times over, lifting his voice higher and
higher, he kisseth the lipp of the cup, the like do the 12. Priests in a row,
one after another, and then it is a goodly ointment, as they say. Now where
have they learned in Gods book these toies? let it be noted for our good, they
are wholly apishe in all their doings, settling their own devises as holy
matters for Gods people, etc. In their perfumes and censers they are as
childish again, and will not see it. But let this suffice of this Chap.

CHAP. 31.
1. THe Lord having thus appointed a Tabernacle to be made, it pleases him now
to give gifts to men, to be able to work and make these goodly things
appointed to be made. And this use I would make of it, to learn, yt he which
thus provided for the building of his earthly Tabernacle, assuredly will never
be careless of raising up ye spiritual: only let us be careful to provide
that they may have a cheerful maintenance that work this spiritual work, as
they had that wrought this earthly work.

2 In that the Lord says, he had called by name Bezaleel, Ver. 2
it may comfortably assure us, that such a care has the Lord of us, as even
our very Names are known unto him. He knew the City called Damascus, he knew
the street in it which was called Straight, he knew the house, the rooms upper
and nether, the furniture etc. He knew Ananias Name, Simo^ the Tanners Name,
and here Bezaleel his Name. We account it a great matter to be known by Name to
the King here on earth, and how much more should we joy to be known so
particularly to the King of Heaven? He that best knows what is true comfort,
names this by ye Prophet Esaias saying, Fear not Jacob, for I have Esa. 43. 1.
Esaias. 49. 1. Luke. 10. 20.
called thee by thy Name, thou art mine. The like in Cyrus Chap. 45. v. 4. and
in other places. Rejoice that your Names are written in Heaven, says the
Gospel.

3 In that God says he had filled these workmen with Ver. 3.
the Spirit of God in wisdom, and understanding, and in knowledge, and in
workmanship; it plainly shows, that handy-crafts are ye works of Gods Spirit,
therefore ought to be duly esteemed. In the Proverbs of Solomon it is said.
The Lord has made both these, even the ear to Prou. 20. 12.
hear, and the eye to see; meaning that both in Governors and Crafts-men,
Wisdom and skill to do the work well, is of the LORD. Thanks are to be
given to this gracious GOD for raising up in all ages such Men. And their
cunning works consequently may be used, so that pride and vanity be
abandoned. Nay note the words again in the Text, and you may see, that not
only the first gift in these things is of the LORD, but all increase and
going-forward in the same. For the LORD says, it is of HIM that they shall be
able TO FINDEOVT CVRIOVS WORKS, that is, to devise more and Ver. 4.
more daily.

4 Notwithstanding keep ye my SABBATH etc, A Ver. 13.
place never to be forgotten touching the LORDS care of the SABBATH, for he
will not have his own work meddled withal on that day. O, what can we think
of our works? His Tabernacle-builder must be forbidden, and our buildings must
go on. Read and feel that place in Jeremy with a tender heart. If the
SABBATH be kept, Kings and Princes shall enter in at the gates, etc. Ier. 17.
25. etc.
that is, the Government shall stand and flourish: if not, the LORD will kindle
a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the places of Jerusalem, and
it shall not be quenched: that is, the LORD will overthrow all with a very
fearful destruction. He is the same now that then, and his glory as dear
to him. Let it move us.

5 When the Lord had made an end of communing with Moses, he gave him two
Tables of stone written with Ver. 18.
the FINGER of GOD. By which name of the FINGER OF GOD Saint Augustine says,
the Holy Ghost was signified. Neque enim Deus forma corporis definitus est,
Augustinus.
nec sic in illo membra et digiti cogitandi sunt, quemadmodum videmus in nobis;
sed quiaper Spiritum Sanctum dona Dei sanctis sic diuiduntur, vt ^u^ diuersa
possint, non tamen disceda^t a concordia charitatis: in digitis enim maxim
apparet quaedam diuisio, non tamen ab vnitatepraescisio: Sieve propterea, sieve
propter aliam quamcumque causam, Spiritus Sanctus appellatus est Digitus Dei.
For God is not limited or concluded within any form or shape of body,
neither are limbs and Fingers to be imagined so to be in him, like as we see
them in our selves; but because by the Holy Ghost the gifts of God are so
distributed unto holy men, that although they be able to do differing things,
yet they do nothing contrary to the quietness of love: For in the Fingers most
of all is seen some certain separation, howbeit no cutting off from unity
among themselves: Either for that cause, or for some other cause (whatsoever it
be) the Holy Ghost is termed the Finger of God. Theophilact Theophilact. in
11. cap. Luc^.
thinks Spiritum Sanctum, Dei apellari digitum propter (...). Sicut enim
(inquit) Digitus toti corpori est (...): ita Spiritus Patri and filio. That the
holy Ghost is called the Finger of God, because of the same substance. For even
as (says he) the finger is of the same substance with the whole body: so is
the Holy Ghost with the Father and the Son. Ambrose notes that the naming of
the Finger Ambros. lib. de Spiritu sancto.
is to be referred ad formam vnitatis, non ad distinctionem potestatis, to the
manner of unity in the Godhead, not to the distinction of power. But an
Objection is made, how they were written with the Finger of God, when Moses is
said to have written them, Exodus 34 28? and diverse men answer diversely. S.
Austine thinks the first Aug. lib. 5. quaestein Deutr^. cap. 15.
were written, by God, which being broken, the second were written by Moses.
But Moses plainly affirms yt both were written by God. Exodus 31. 18. Deuteronomy.
10. 2. Lyra therefore says, Deum scripsisse authoritatiue and dictando: Lyra.
Mosen ministerialiter and figurando. God wrote as the Author that prescribed,
but Moses as the Minister and a figure. Then not liking this so well, Fieri
potuit (ait) vt Moses manu^ tabulae admouerit, Deus aute^ miraculose litter as
formauit. It might be (says he) ye Moses hand was put to ye table of God
miraculosly framed the letters. Hugo says, Hugo.
Moses wrote the Tables, that is, He received them written. Later Writers make
this answer, that the words Exodus Neoterici.
34. 28. referred to Moses, should be referred to God. And for Moses writing,
it was that volume Exodus 17. ver. 14. But let this much suffice of this Chapter.

CHAP. 27.
I will shut up these Chapters following, as briefly as I can, and leave the
amplificatio^s of the Notes to the dilligent Readers own meditatio^s. In this
Chap. we see 4. principal Heads. The Idolatry of the people. The wrath of
God. The Intercession of Moses. The fact of Moses.


1. TOuching ye first, follow the words, and note things as they lie. The text
says, when the people saw that Moses tarried long ere he came Ver. 1.
down from the mountain, etc. The causes of Idolatry are more than can be
reckoned up, but some you may here think of: and first of this that appears
in these words, impatiencie to stay for Moses coming down from the Mountain.
Such impaciencie made Saul run to a Witch, and even at these times many to do
the like. God does defer many times his help for the trial of men, and
then having not his holy Spirit to make them patie^t, they rashly and hastily
fly to forbidden means for help. It was truly said, Fear makes Gods, to
wit, false Gods. Timor fecit in orb Deos. Lucanus.
For in distresses and agonies, as I say, men do (as here they did) run to
wicked devises, thinking so to comfort themselves. A second cause of Idolatry
is often an ignorant imitation of things not rightly understood, as, because
Abraham was commanded to offer up his son Isaac, and his readiness to do
it so well taken; therefore men would follow him herein and offer up their
sons and daughters with bloody hands to their false Gods. A third cause,
foolish doting love and affection: Thus was Solomon made an Idolater for his
love to his Wives. And it is written of Alexander, that he so loved Ephestio,
as he decreed divine honor to be done unto him. A drian the Emperor did the
like to a most wicked and naughty person whom he loved. A fourth cause, good
hap or prospertie: Thus did the Athenians, who having but Ten Thousand in their
army against the Persians at Marathe (the Lacedaemonians being not yet come) it
is said a certain Spirit apeared in their army in the likeness of Pan, and
mightily daunted their adversaries, assuring them after of victory in the same
likeness. Whereupon in great kindness (forsooth) they would ever after
worship Pan, and built him a Chapel under the Temple of Pallas. Thus is man's
nature prone to Idolatry, and takes very small occasions to fall from God.
The root of this foul Idolatry here, was that foul and odious vice of
ingratitude, forgetting all the great works and wonders of God done and showed
for them; and by name, their so comfortable deliverance from such thraldom and
misery in Egypt. Such vice and such effect of it rules still in too many
whose eyes have been lightened, and whose hearts have been comforted with
truth of the Gospel, and yet cursedly and damnably they fall from this kind
God, and run a whoring after their own inventions, whose wisdom herin is much
like the Thracians, that could not (as Aristotle says) number above five.
Wherefore against this fearful inconstancy and mutabilitie of our natures,
let us often use (from our hearts) the words of the Psalm, Make me a clean
heart, O God, and renew a right spirit Psalm. 51. 10.
within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit
from me. Give me the comfort of thy help again and stablishe me with thy free
Spirit. I am thy servant; O give me understanding to learn thy Testimonies.

2 They gathered themselves together against Aaron, and said unto him, up, and
make us Gods to go beforevs. They never ask Aaron, whether it might be done
lawfully or no, but up, and do it; most presumptuously directing him, who
should direct the^, and audatiously urging him to approve what they liked.
Think here of some people, and some parishes, where if ye minister will not do
as they fancy, allowing their da^cings and drinkings, their bowls and their
pastimes full of disorder and sin (for orderly recreatio^ is good) they fall
out with him, they turn both heart and hand from him, and he is now become their
greatest enemy, because he heartily wishes their salvation. But I said I would
not amplify much, and therefore your self meditate of this hateful and
pernicious boldness in some Congregations.

3 For this Moses (the man that brought us out of the la^d of Egypt) we know
not what is become of him. And is this all ye care of him, if he be gone? Such
an instrument of God and good to them, such a deliverer, such a famous
Governor, so dear to God, so familiar with God, and so graced and honored by
God? O ingratitude! O world! and fickle tickle hold-fast of ye multitude! A man
would have thought they would have wept out their eyes almost, and sighed their
hearts in sunder for such a man, if they had conceited the loss of him: But it
is not so. And therefore by this example let all men be wise, and look at the
Author of their calling, joy in their obedience to him, rest upon his gracious
acceptance, which shall never fail a single heart, and leave the world to be a
world full of unthankfulness to all degrees of well deseruers. Mark also how
contemptuously they speak of this worthy man, when they say, This Moses, This
Moses, etc. How many circumstances taught them more reverence to such an one?
make use of it, and prepare for the like. Forewarned forearmed, if it happen.

4 Aaron demanded their golden eare-rings, thinking they would not have given
them. For in the East countries such eare-rings were ornaments, and the
pleasures of women. Tokens also of Nobility, as the Romans had their Bullas.
But he was deceived: so pleasing to our corruption is Idolatry and
superstition, that no cost is much unto us to set forward that. Women in all
countries are much wedded to their Jewels, yet to such a purpose they will part
with them, when unto goodness and truth a very half-penie grieves them. Read
Nehemiah, 13. verse. 10. and Agge, 1. verse. 2. Ut lapis Thracius ignem and
flammas Lapis Thracius.
concipit, quando in aquam mergitur, contra vero perfusus oleo, extinguitur:
sic quidam magnam operam in rebus fictis ponunt, nullisque sumptibus parcunt;
contra vero, audita voce Euangel^^ (quod est salutare oleu^ mitigans dolores
vulnerum) fiunt segnes ad omnia bona, etc. As the stone, that cast into the
water burns, and having oil powered upon it, is extinguished: so some men
bestow much labor about vain things, and spare no cost; but as soon as they
hear the voice of the Gospel (which is as a wholesome oil mitigating the
grief of wounds) they become dull and heavy to all goodness, etc. As wicked
Adulterers will bestow much upon their harlots, and pinch for any thing to
their lawful wives: so do Idolatrous and superstitious Verse. 4.
men and women, etc. Aaron makes them an Idol when he saw their rage, and from
the folly of the people and the weakness of the ministers, what Idolatry and
impiety has come? He makes it like a Calfe, following the manner of Egypt,
wherein Calves, Oxen, and Serpents were worshipped, and showing how apt we are
to learn the corruption of any place where we soiourne and abide. This
fearful fall of Aaron does not encourage any to fall as he did, in hope to
find mercy as he did, more than the example of one that has broken his leg,
and been healed, hearteneth any man to do the same. But it well teaches and
shows the shameless pride of them, who being neither in calling nor gifts
like Aaron, yet say they cannot err. I would they saw their errors themselves,
as well as the world sees them: And being great and grievous errors, had hearts
themselves to leave them, and to think well of those that for them only
(without any hatred to their persons) dissent from them. The Leuiticall High
priest (by the ordinance of God) was above all Priests, and yet Jeremy,
Zachary, and others dissented from them that had the place. And the Apostle
gives it for a true course, if an Angel from heaven teach amiss, he must not
be followed, but accursed. Some have excused Aaron here, as Bernard: Aaron
Sceleratis tumultuantis populi Bernard. Epist. 38.
clamoribus contra voluntatem suam cessit. Aaron against his will gave place to
the cries of this tumultuous people. Theodoret says, Vitulum formare
necessario coactus est. He Thodoret.
was forced to make this Calfe. Augustine, Aaron erranti populo ad idolum
fabric andum non consensit inductus, sedcessit Aug. lib. 14. de ciuit. Dei.
cap. 11.
obstrictus. Aaron did not yield to this erring people for an Idol, induced by
persuasion, but forced by compulsion. Ambrose leaves it in doubt, saying,
Neque excusare tantum Ambros: Epist. 56.
Sacerdotem possumus, neque condemnare audemus. Neither can we excuse so
excellent a Priest, neither dare we condemn him, etc. Thus in reverence and
modesty have men written, when indeed the fall was foul, and not to be
excused: for seeing the Idol so to please. He made also an Altar, and
appointed an holy day, etc. Verse. 5.
See Deuteronomy. 9. 10. how angry God was, etc.

5 They did not take this Calfe for God, neither was it their meaning to
worship the metal that themselves had given; but it must be a Representation
of God to them, and they will worship God in the Calfe. Therefore, they
proclayme a holy day unto the Lord, not to the Calfe. But did all these excuses
mock God? No, no. The Lord by David says, They worshipped the molten Psalm.
106. 19. 20.
Image. They turned their glory into the similitude 20.
of a Calfe that eats hay. And they forgot God (O mark this) they forgot GOD
their Savior, which had done so great things in Egypt: And therefore the
fierce wrath of God pursued them, as follows. Let it teach our Romish
Idolaters, what will be their end, for even in this sort they excuse their
worshipping of Stocks and Stones.

6 When Aaron saw this, he made an Altar before it, etc. Is not this strange,
that such a man should thus fall, and go forward in evil? Let it strongly
settle in your thoughts what flesh is, if God hold not up; and how one error
begets an other: an ill beginning draweth-on a further proceeding; and
therefore ever the counsel good, Obsta principiis, Stop beginnings.

7 They offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace offerings Vt iugulent
homines surgunt de nocte latrones. Vt teipsum serves non expergisceris?
betimes rising in the Morning to this golden Calfe, That we might have a
lively pattern of man's corruption. For who would ever have believed thus much,
if we had not seen it in this sort. Those Sacrifices were such as God
appointed, but now diuerted from their use, and therefore nothing less than
pleasing to God. Even so learn you, that although we use the same words in our
prayers, and do the same things ye the Scripture appoints, as to give alms,
and such like; yet, if we do them not in manner and form as they are
appointed, they differ from right, as these Sacrifices did here; and we
provoke God to his fearful wrath in stead of reward, or any blessing. Be not
blinded then with the matter, but carefully look also at the manner, and use
things appointed by God to the very end that God appointed them for. Luxuriant
animi rebus plaerumque secundis. Duo simul admissa capitalia crimina, opprobria
carnis, and mentis sacrilegia. Ambros. Epist. 36. ad Sabinu^.
The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play, namely, to
dance, to leap, and be merry, rejoicing in their New God, etc. So did the
Gentiles at their Sacrifices and great meetings, so do the Romish company at
this day, and so will it ever be, where Cum corpus in refectionis delectatione
resoluitur, Cor ad inane gaudium relaxatur. Greg. 1. Moral. cap. 5. vide Moral.

man's will, and not Gods will is followed. When men have made unto themselves a
Golden Calfe, it is a wonder to see how they please themselves with it, and how
they joy in their absurd invention. The Scripture speaks of works in some
places, and of Faith in others, join therefore (say some) both together in the
matter of Justification, and then all is well. This is their Calfe, and who may
speak against it? Thus think of more, Never was ye world so full of Calves as
now, etc.

8 Ver. 7. Ingratitudinem notat. q. d. tuus Pop. quem eduxisti, quem docuisti
etc.
Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down: for thy people which thou
have brought out of the land of Egypt, has corrupted their ways, etc. Thus
knows the Lord ever what men do, albeit they little think of him in their
actions. Thus dangerous again is the absence of the Pastor, which is too
little thought of either by the Pastor many times, or the flock. Note it also
that he says, tuus populus, thy people, giving a propriety, by reason of his
charge over them; it may work good thoughts, if it be meditated upon, hoth in a
people and in a Pastor.

9 Sometimes the Lord indureth men's misdoings long, and sometimes speedily he
touches them, and restrains them, as here. This later is the better if God
vouchsafe it, and to be prayed for: more sin heaping up more wrath against
the day of wrath. The Lord calls them Moses his people, saying, thy people
have done thus, which thou have brought out of the land of Egypt, when as they
were the Lord his people, and by his mighty arm delivered, not by Moses his
strength. Thus does the Lord ascribe to his Ministers what his power works by
them, that so they may be encouraged in their pains, and the people know to
love them dearly, hearing GOD himself to say, that They be their people.

10 They are soon turned out of the way which I commanded them, Soon, soon,
Note the word, and note our manner, if the Lord keep us not in his true
obedience, Leuitatem and inconstantia^ notat populi, qui cito etc.
and send us good Guides. To fall away from God is fearful, but soon to be
turned aside is an amplification of the fault, and makeh it greater. Pray that
neither the one, nor the other happen unto us.

The second part.
1 Again, the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it
is a stif-necked people. Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot
against them, etc. Still observe with your self, how in-wardly God knows all
people: before he told their action, now he tells their hearts full of
hidden contumacie and stubbornness against him, and let it have this fruit in
you, to make clean both the inside and outside of the platter, that is, watch
over your actions for they are seen of God, and watch over your heart from
whence your actions proceed, for even that also is well known to God. Deceive
your self you easily may, but deceive him you never can. Be wise and be
warned, qualis vita, finis ita, such life, such end usually, etc.

30. super Cantic.
That God wills Moses to let him alone that his wrath may break out, it is a
place to be laid up in your heart, and ever to be ready in your remembrance
for your comfort. For it shows the incomprehensible mercy and loving kindness
of the Lord toward such as truly fear him and serve him, making them in his
goodness, in his bottomless goodness (I say) so powerful and so mighty with
him, that they are to him (as it were) bands to tie him, and a wall against
him, that he cannot execute his anger against offenders, unless they will
suffer him, and (as it were) stand out of his way. O sweet God, what is man
that thou should thus favor him, and have respect unto him? Is there any
thing in man to deserve this? No, no. It is thy mere mercy and love to such
as thou please to love, and the comfort of it unspeakable. When Sodom was to
be destroyed, what read you? Genesis 18. 19.
for so many, and so many, I will not do it. In the Prophet Ezechtel, when
sin so abounded, and wrath was so due, Ezech. 22. 30
what says the Lord, but thus? I sought for a man among them, that should make
up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not
destroy it; but I found none. Therefore have I powered out mine indignation upon
them, and consumed them with the fire 31
of my wrath: their own ways have I rendered upon their own heads. As if he
should have said, might I have found but one to stand in the gap against my
wrath, even for that one, I would have showed mercy and loving kindness. What
a speech of God is that in the Prophet Hosea? I pray you read it often, and
often taste the sweetness of it: How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? How shall
Hosc. 11. 8.
I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee
as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me: my repentings are rolled together. I
will not execute the fiercenes of my wrath: I will not return to destroy 9
Ephraim, for I am God, and not man, etc. Could ever father speak more
compassionately over his child, when he were about to beat him? Surely no
tongue can express the Lords goodness and pity. Therefore settle with your
self this comfort, that if for other men's sins a true Moses be such a stop
to God, that he shall not punish them, and if ten righteous persons, that is,
men and women truly loving God, though full of humane weakness, shall save so
many thousand souls as were in Sodom and Gomorrha; nay, if the Lord himself
have such a melting heart toward his poor people, that when the Rod is up and
he ready to smite, he stays his hand of himself, and breaks into these
Speeches; How should I do it? my heart is turned up and down in me, etc, what
force have your own sighs and groans for your own sins before him? your
true tears flowing from a grieved heart, that you have offended him? Can he
strike you holding up your hands for mercy, and looking upon him with watrie
eyes, humbled in the dust before him, and for Christ, Christ his dear Son in
whom he is perfectly pleased, begging pardon? O no, no, be assured. And
therefore ever make up this wall of defense by true prayer and repentance
against him, and stand your self in the gap, thus crying to him in his Son,
against your own sins, and be assured you shall prevail. By Moses for these
Israelites, and by Christ for you, God is stopped and will not destroy.

3 Note again with your self, how intolerable a sin Idolatry is before
God, when the Lord uses such vehement words as these, That my wrath may wax
hot against them, and that I may consume them. Thus sin our Romish
Catholics every day, and because God strikes not presently, they think he
will never strike. Their Idolatries are many, and you may consider of them by
other learned Treatises published in this matter.

The third part.
1 THen Moses prayed and said, O Lord, etc. Here, Ver. 11.
here then see A faithful Magistrate, A faithful Minister, A true Shepeheard
over his people committed to him of God. Who knows what judgments godly
Governors turn away by their earnest intercession to God for their people? We
see this place, we read what Hester did, and the mercy of God is plain for
their sakes. It should work in us all love, and obedience, and duty to them,
and make us day and night pray for the continuance of them. Treasons and
treacheries, raylings and reuilings, slanders and defamations, wrongs and
injuries any way, are not fit requitals of such good received by them, and for
them. This prayer of Moses, if you mark it, is most vehement, as coming from
a moved heart, and uses vehement and urging arguments unto God. A peculio and
haereditate, quia tuus, inquit, populus. 1. A memoria beneficiorum
praeteritorum, quae irrita essent omnia, populo non amplius superstite. 2.

As first, of his favor all ways extended to them, verse. 11. Secondly, of his
glory which would be obscured by the A^gyptians lewd speeches, if he destroyed
them, ver. 12. Thirdly, of his promises made unto their fathers, Abraham,
Isaac, and Israel, the truth whereof might not be violated, verse. 13. with
which the Lord moved in mercy, stays as you see. Such Reasons serve even at
this day, and may be used to the Lord in our prayers. He has been good to us
infinite ways, and we may entreat him by these passed favors to vouchsafe
future, and to stay his wrath which we have deserved. Nothing more common^with
Psalm. 4. 1. Verse. 13 Remember Abraham etc. that is, thy promise made to Abraham
etc. not Abraham's prayers made in heaven for the^, etc.
David in every Psalm, if you mark it. Again, even by our punishment the
enemy will be proud, and speak evil, they will call both himself and his
truth into question, and eclipse his glory to the uttermost. His promises
also we have most richly, and therefore in all these respects we may crave
pardon, and doing of it heartely with true repentance and purpose to amend, he
is the same God still, and we shall find favor.

2 Upon this earnest prayer the Lord (says the text, v. 14.) changed his mind
from the evil which he threatened to do unto his people: with which comfort
Moses came away, and drawing near the host, he first heard the noyce of
singing. verse. 18. for they were making merry about their new God: then
coming nearer, he saw the Calfe and the dancing, verse. 19. But then, although
he were the meekest man in the world: yet his wrath waxed hot, and he cast the
Tables out of his hands, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountain. Which
breaking of the first Tables, allegorically showed, that the law of God
lighting upon our unregenerated nature, is broken (as it were) and by the
means of our inabilitie cannot justify us. But the second written tables are
put in the Arc, that is, when God by his Spirit works in us, we are
regenerated, and the law is obeyed of us, though not fully, yet in measure, and
this imperfect obedience is made perfect by Christ. Aug. Magno etiam mysteris
figurata est iteratio Testamenti noui, qucniam vetus erat abolendum and
constituendum nouum. Quaest. 144. By a great mystery the abrogating of the
old Testament by the coming of the new was figured. But understand Augustine
rightly. Then he took the Calfe which they had made, and burned it in the
fire, and ground it to powder, and strowed it upon the water, and made the
children of Israel drink of it, verse. 20. Partly to despite them, and partly
that they should have no occasion to remember it: Vt discat P^p. contemnere
quod in secessum proijci videret. Hieron* ad Fabiolam. Factum est (inquit Aug.)
magnum sacramentu^. Et addit, O ira prophetica, and animus non turbatus, sed
illuminatus etc. Vide eundem prolixius lib. 22. contra Faustum, ca. 43 Ambros.
de Mose. ad Romulu^ Omnia (in quit) impietatis vestigia abolere voluit, de
populo: absorbuit omnem and perfidiam and superbiam, ne eum absorbeat impietas
and arroga^tia. Aug. in exposit. Psalm. 73.
After he rebuked Aaron, verse. 21. And if Aaron now elect High priest and a
Figure of Christ be so sharply rebuked of Moses, surely great men must be
reproved, and it is a cursed doctrine, that, though the Pope should carry
thousands of souls to hell, yet no man may say, Sir, why do you thus?
Secondly, in matters concerning the glory of God, we must rebuke even our
near ones as others; no place for affection. After that, he called for such as
would revenge this wrong done to the Lord, verse. 26. and the Yet this fact made
them not irregular, nor unfit f^r the ministry. Ambrose was a man that had

sons of Leui gathering to him, he bad every man put his sword by his side,
go to and fro, from gate to gate, through the host, and slay every man his
brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. verse. 27.
so that there fell of the people the same day about three thousand men. verse.
28. This was the zeal of his heart to the glory of God, and it must be a
glass for us to look in whilst we live in this world. The Lord has placed the
commandments in the Decalogue, and the petitions in the Lords prayer which
concern his honor, before those which concern our selves; to teach us, that we
ought to prefer his glory before all worldly things, yea even life it self,
if they come in Question together. Thus did Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
thus did Daniel, when he he opened his window and made his prayer to God,
notwithstanding that cruel law; thus did the Mother and her seven sons in
the Machabees, thus did Elias, Phinees, David and others. Thus did not old
Heli, and therefore the Lord smote him. Mine eyes gush out with tears (says
the holy Prophet) because men keep not thy law. And, do not I hate them that
hate thee, and am grieved with them that rise against thee? Yea, I hate them
right sore, even as though they were mine enemies. He that loves Father, or
mother, more than me, is not worthy of me, Math. 10. 37.
And he that loves Son, or Daughter, more than me, is not worthy of me,
etc.

3 And when the Morning came, Moses said unto the people: ye have committed a
grievous crime, but Verse. 30.
now I will go up to the Lord, if I may pacify him for your sin. Moses
therefore went again unto the Lord, 31
and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods
of Gold. Therefore now if thou pardon their sin, thy mercy shall appear:
but if thou will 32
not, I pray thee, raze me out of the book which thou have written. When Moses
had fought on Gods part with the sword, now he strives for the people with his
prayer; so, both true to God in a holy zeal, and careful of his people in the
bowels of love, was this holy man, this faithful Governor and leader of this
multitude. Anotable example for all Magistrates and all Ministers ever to
follow. But here is more than I said in the former Note. For here is a
preferring of Gods Glory before even life and comfort eternal, which is far
more than this temporal life, and all the joys of it. So shall you see in
Saint Paul to the Romans, and what a measure Romans 9. 3.
of Gods holy Spirit it was, consider you. Far are we from this, that
prefer every small profit and pleasure before this glory of God, and yet
say, we hope to be saved as well as they. A true feeling of our own iniquity
herein may much amend us hereafter, and God for his Sons sake give it us.
Again, you may note here, how Moses doubleth over and over in this Chapter the
foulness of their fault, calling it a great sin, a grievous sin, etc. so
learning you not to extenuate faults before God, if you sue for mercy, but to
set them out in their true colors, that mercy may the more appear.

4 Touching this Book of life, you must know it to be a figurative Speech,
borrowed from the manners of men, who use Books and writings for their
memory, and not conceive that God has, or needs any such things. It is
therefore (in sense) as if Moses had said, O Lord pardon them, or deprive me of
that salvation which is as sure before thee, as if it were registered and
written in a book. Such borrowed speeches you have more in Scriptures, as you
may remember. In the Psalm Psa. 139. 16.
you read of a Book wherein, David says Were all his members written, which
day by day were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them. In the
Revelation you read of books again, when he says, I saw Apoc. 20. 12.
the dead, both great and small stand before God, and the Books were opened,
etc. And for the Book of life, you read persons written in it of two sorts,
one as it seemed, the other true indeed. Of the first speaks the Psalm, Let
them be wiped out of the Book of the living, and not be written among the
righteous, meaning wherein they seemed to be written, or might persuade
themselves they were written, but indeed were not. For then they could Dan. 12.
1. Apoc. 20. 12. Luke. 10. 20.
not be wiped out. Of the later you read here, and in other places. Where
though Moses speak of rasing out, yet indeed there is no such matter, being
nothing but the Aug. Si homo dicit, quod scripsi scripsi, multo magis Deus etc.
Ezech. 18. 19.
eternal election of God, which never can be altered. This is more plain in
the words following, when God answered Moses, that Whosoever sinned against
him, he would put him out of the Book, meaning, he would make it appear,
that he never was written in it. For, the house built upon the Rock can never
fall. They Math. 7. 25. Math. 24. 24.
should deceive the very Elect, if it were possible, as if he should say, but
it is impossible. He that comes to me, Ionn. 6. 37. Ioh. 10. 28.
I never cast away. No man takes my sheep out of my hand, and many such other
places.

Lastly, consider and note here, how he bids Moses No certain time noted,
but often were they punished. Aaron was very sorry: and, Quem poenitet
peccasse, pene non peccauit, inquit Plautus; and Seneca, qnem poenitet peccasse
pene est. etc.
go on with his charge, but for the people he will visit them. verse. 34. And so
the Lord plagued the people, because they caused Aaron to make the Calfe which
he made, verse. 35. It tells Magistrates and Ministers that they may not
desist from their duties for the peoples frowardnes, but indeuouring to their
uttermost to reform them, they must go on though they perish; and even in them
so perishing, they shall be a sweet savor to the Lord. That Aaron thus escaped
among them, if you think of it, Answer your self, The Lord knows whom to
spare Dominus nouit cui parcat vsque ad commutationem in melius, and cui parcat
ad tempus, quamuis eum praescierit in melius non mutari: and cui non parcat vt
mutetur in melius, and eui non farcat ita vt vitae mutationem eius non
expectet. Aug. in Quest. in Exodus
for their amendment, and whom for a time to spare, though he know they will
never amend. O, how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past all
finding out! Grievous, and thrice grievous is the sin of Idolatry, that not
for Moses his so earnest prayer may be freed wholly from all further punishment,
though in part the Lord yields, as verse. 14. you saw. God make it sink where
it is so much used by deceived Romish Recusants.

CHAP. 33.
1 GReat was the sin which this people had committed, mentioned in the former
Chapter; and therefore the Lord (whose mercy has neither bottom nor measure)
not willing the death of any sinner, much less of so many thousands, but
rather that (by repentance) pardon may be procured; in this Chapter graciously
uses the means that their hearts may smite them with true feeling of their
fault, and so they turn, and be spared. Their sin (I say) was great, and
great sins are not so easily repented of as they ought to be. Again, in
sins of this kind, namely, when they are colored and covered over with a
good intention, by them to serve to GOD, most hardly are men and women drawn
to acknowledge an error and mistaking. Matters of the second Table committed
against our neighbor we much better discern, than matters of the first Table
concerning the worship of God. For here we think wholly our meaning should be
accepted, which was, to worship God, be the thing we do, either never so void
of warrant in the word, or never so contrary to the word. The means that God
uses here, is by letting them know, that he will be no more with the^ as he
has been, nor travel with them as he has done. Verse. 1. 2
Moses shall go on with them to the land which God had promised to give the^;
And to send his Angel to drive out the Canaanites; But himself would not go,
for they were a 3
stif-necked people, lest he should consume the^ in the way. The Lord notes a
manner of repentance, namely, to put away 4
their costly raiment from the^, not yt this is a necessary part of Repentance
always, but that at this time by this 5
outward sign, the Lord would have them testify that which is needful
indeed, the true remorse and sorrow of their hearts. And upon the hearing of
this fearful news, 6
that indeed the Lord would thus deal with them, they cast from them
accordingly their best attire, and sorrowed for their fault.

2 For further working of this saving sorrow in them, the Tabernacle wherein
the Lord will confer with his servant Moses, until the other (now so much
spoken of) was ready, is, by the appointment of God to Moses, pitched without
the host far of from the host, that by this Verse. 7.
sign also it might be showed, how God was estranged from them for their
sin, who erst so comfortably, and so powerfully had showed himself for
them, and amongst them. All which things religiously considered, manifest unto
our souls what a sweet God the Lord whom we serve is, who thus seeks his
lost people; even a father full of all pity and compassion, that they may
return to him again, and have that which so ill they have deserved, his
favor and love for ever. Will this God (can you think in your conscience)
ever cast away the poor sinner that comes in sorrow, when he works thus to
draw men to sorrow? Feel, and be comforted with it.

3 Verse. 8. Argumentum resipiscentis animi assurgere. etc. Aquila per
senectutem tam curuum acquirit rostrum, vt vesci non possit, nisi ad lapidem

And when Moses went out unto the Tabernacle, all the people rose up, etc; now
reuerencing him, whom before they spoke very lightly of, saying: This Moses we
know not what is become of him. What caused this, but that still he was in
favor with God, and they out? So, so shall a sound and upright heart to God
ever in the end procure honor, howsoever for a time contempt may be showed: for
God will honor them that honor him; it is his Word, and it shall never fail.
That union that was betwixt God and his servant John Baptist (when he was true
to God, and God truly favored him again) gave him more honor and good
estimation in the heart of Herod (though an evil man) than they had whose
worldly show was far greater. For Herod feared John Mar. 6. 20.
(says the Gospel) knowing that he was a just man, and a holy, and
reverenced him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him
gladly. Would God then men might be moved to seek honor this way. Surely the
Lord is the same still, and will make them rise up to you, that have formerly
little (and too little) regarded you, as well as here he did to Moses, if you
with Moses keep fast your foot with him when others wickedly fall away, as
these unhappy Israelites had now done.

4 In the 14. verse, and so to the 18, see and mark the faithful heart of a
true Governor, how he prays and never gives over till the Lord has yielded
to go with this people, as in former time, whereas he had said he would not
do it. O force of faithful prayer! It subdueth all things in time, yea it
pleases the Almighty Maker of all worlds masses to be subdued withit. In the
end it prevails, though it be long, but still this is mercy, and not merit,
Verse. 17.
no not in Moses himself. For I will do this also that thou have said, (says
God) because thou have found grace in my sight, and I know thee by Name. Grace
it is therefore, and no merit, and a blessed grace it is, to see and hold it
firm, against al proud and ignorant Merit-mongers.

5 Again Moses said, I beseech thee show me thy Verse. 18.
glory, etc. Hitherto Moses kept himself in his desires within the bonds of
modesty, but now he exceeds, seeking what was neither lawful, nor
profitable; for so by the denial and repulse which GOD gave him, it appears.
Yet was it not any foolish curiosity that moved Moses, but a very earnest
desire to be further strengthened in his charge. Wherefore, if to such a mind,
that might be hurtful which he so much desired, and thought so profitable; let
it school us, and teach us what we do, when in a vain curiosity of our
corrupt nature, we search and pry into such things as God has kept hidden and
close from us. It is a true saying, Mitte quod esse nequit, quaere quod esse
potest. Let that alone which cannot be found out, and seek that which may be
found out. The Secrets of God are to himself, and revealed things for us. He
that curiously searches his glory, shall justly be oppressed of his Majesty.
To profit and go forward in knowedge is good, but the right way must also be
held, which is, To follow God going before, that is, to have an ear to hear
where God has a mouth to speak, and not else.

6 But concerning this sight thus desired of Moses to speak a little more, to
an ignorant man the Scripture in that point may seem contrary to it self.
For here it is said, There is no man shall see God and live. And Saint Verse.
20.
Paul that he dwells in light not to be attained to, whom no man has seen,
neither can see. Again, To the king immortal, invisible. And John, No man
has seen God at any time. On the other side it is often in Scripture
testified, that God was not seen of the old Fathers and Patriarchs, and in
the Gospel, Blessed are the pure in Math. 5. 8.
heart, for they shall see God. Saint John says, We shall see him as he is.
Saint Paul, Now I know in part, but 1. Cor. 13. 12.
then shall I know even as I am known. To the Ephesians, That ye being rooted
and grounded in love, May be able Ephesians. 3. 17. and 18.
to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height,
and depth of Christ, etc. But to a diligent obseruer of the Scriptures these
places are not contrary. Therefore consider with your self, that Seeing is of
two sorts; with the outward eye, and with the in-ward mind. Concerning the
outward sight (whereby indeed curious and ignorant men would be glad to see
God, hardly thinking (often times) that there is any God, when none in this
sort can be seen) the truth is, God cannot be seen. For, if he could, then
must he be a body; and if a body, then to be divided into parts, and included
in a place, and so not infinite, and therefore not God. Wherefore gross are
those Old Heretics that gave to God an humane form, Anthropomorphites monks.
Audiandi. See Epiphan.
Because the Scriptures (speaking after our capacity) give unto him the parts
of man, as feet, hands, face, etc. And concerning those visions and
apparitions which the Fathers had, as Abraham of three going to destroy Sodom,
etc. We answer with S. Augustine, that God appeared unto them, yet not in his
Nature, but in such form as it pleased him. Many saw, sed quod Voluntas
elegit, non quod Natura formauit, but what saw they? surely what his Will
chose, not what Nature formed. Men saw him when he would, in such form as he
would, not in his Nature, wherein he lay hid even then when he was seen. The
Divinity when it takes these shapes, is not converted into these shapes, but
appears under them. GOD his Nature is simple, one, and immutable; those
forms in Scripture were diverse and sundry; therefore by the very diversity of
them, We know none of them were the true Nature of GOD. Only in our flesh we
may say GOD was seen, after 1. Ioh. 1. 1
Christ had taken it into the unity of his person, but that is not the matter
now spoken of. So, touching the first kind of seeing, with bodily eyes, we
conclude, that No man has, or can see God at any time and live, Ver. 20.
as here GOD himself says in this Text. The second kind of seeing is by
mind, wherein we must distinguish our estate here, from that it shall be in the
next world. For neither by mind (whilst we live here) are we able to see God
as he is. The reason; Because all our knowledge is by some forms and fashions
which we conceive in our mind, and for the most part flows from the out-ward
senses; but God (as has been said) cannot be perceived by our se^ses:
Therefore, neither by our mind ca^ we comprehend him as he is. And for these
words in ye Chap. That ye Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a Ma^speaketh
unto his friend, they note out a more familiar and gracious Ver. 11.
manner of speech, than before was vouchsafed to any, but not any bodily sight
of God in substance and essence, as he is. But in the life to come we shall in
far more exellent manner see GOD, yet not simply, neither as he is, because he
is infinite, we still finite although changed from our corruption. So, no way
can GOD be seen as he is of any creature, either with his bodily sense, or
with his mind in this life, or that to come. Yet such a measure shall be
affoorded to us, as no heart can comprehend now ye comfort of it. Let it
suffice, and be careful rather to attain to it, than curiously and
unprofitably to sift and searh Omnia ad Christum rectissime accommoda^tur, qui

the manner of it.

7 The covering of Moses face with GODS hand till he was past him, is but a
borrowed speech from the fashion of men, who use to hold their hands over
their eyes when they look upon the Sun; for the brightness and glory
thereof is more than their eyes can endure. It is fit therefore to note and
teach us the incomprehensible Majesty and glory of God, above all power in
man to look upon, but it may not lead us to any erroneous conceit, ye God
has hands or humane form, or did thus in any material manner. So his back
parts note such a measure of glory, as Moses (a mortal man) was able to endure.
Otherwise, God bath no back nor back parts, but is a Spirit inco^prehensible
and above al man's strength to know fully as he is, in majesty, glory,
substance, and nature. We may be said to see the back parts of GOD, because
there is much more which we know not than which we know, and we must still
go forward while we live, in the knowledge of him. Deus videri non potest,
quia visu clarior; co^prehendi non potest, quia tactu purior; non aestimari,
quia sensu mayor est. Ideo eu^ digne aestimanus, ^u^ inaestimabile^ dicimus. In
nostra dedica^dus est me^te, in nostro consecra^dus est pectore, etc. God
cannot be seen, says S. Cyprian, because he is brighter than our sight; God
cannot be comprehended, because he is more pure than can be touched, he cannot
be esteemed as he deserves, because he is greater than our sense. Therefore we
rightly estimat him, when we say he is inestimable. In our mind he is to be
dedicated, and in our breast to be consecrated, etc. Solemn Dionys.
est Deum dicere inuisibilem, cum sit luxclarissima; ineffabilem, cum multis
insigniatur nominibus. Attribuunt ergo ei priuationes, vt habituum exellent iam
demonstrent. It is usual to call God invisible, when indeed he is a most
clear light; to call him ineffable, when indeed he has many Names. The
reason is, that these negatiues or priuations might show the ercellencie of the
affirmative or habit.

CHAP. 34.
1. THere is little in these Chapters following, which has not bin touched
already in the former: and therefore I may in few words end them, and refer
you to that which has been said. First then, you read here that the former
Tables being Ver. 1.
broken, the LORD renueth them again. And observe these things for your good.
Moses is commanded to hew the stones, but the Lord would write in them; so may
Gods Ministers by preaching and crying upon men, as it were hew their
stoniehearts, that is, prepare them for writing, but only the Lord must write
in them by the finger of his blessed Spirit and no man can make any thing enter
without him. Paul may plant, etc, but HE, HE gives all increase. Cathedram
in coelo habet, qui corda mouet, His chair is in Heaven that moves the
heart. And did God write before the stones were hewed? No. No More assure your
self will he ever in your heart set any good, if you contemn and despise the
outward hewing and preparing of you by the Word in the Ministry of his
servants. Take heed the refore what you do, you despise not men, but GOD and
your own good. Others by these former Tables broken and latter Tables
remaining, have thought to be figured the abrogation of the Old Law, and the
establishment of the New, the law of the Gospel: The cutting o^^ of the Jews,
and the grafting in of the Gentiles: Our old corruption which must be broken,
and our new regeneration which must come in place, etc.

2 And be ready in the morning, that thou may come up early to the mount
Sinai, etc. The godly Ver. 2.
must be ready to ascend at all hours when the LORD shall appoint, and they
neither must nor will stay to bid their friends farewell, or to regard any
earthly impediment whatsoever. O Lord, make us thus ready ever: For here we
have no abiding City. Early, early must we ascend, and so did the Apostle,
when he desired to be loosed, and to be with Christ: Forward, not backward
was that happy man, and so must we be.

3 Let no man come up with thee, etc. Fear and reverence is ever fit for holy
things, and presuming boldness Ver. 3.
sauoureth never of that Holy Spirit whose effects fear and reverence are.
Moses did with speed (as God commanded) hew two Tables of stone, and went up
early. Two biddings he needs not, and a thousand thousand Ver. 4.
will not serve us, etc.

4 And the Lord descended in the cloud, etc. Moses Ver. 5.
ascends, and GOD descends; So is it in our manner of knowing him: we must
ascend in heart, and mind, and will; he does descend, most graciously
submitting himself to our weak and feeble capacities, etc.

5 Confer the 6. and 7. ver. with that which was in the former Chapter ver.
18. and so forth, and the one will notably explane the other.

6 Then Moses made haste, and bowed himself to the Verse. 8.
earth, and worshipped. The greater measure of manifestation of God and his
truth is vouchsafed unto us, the more ought we to humble our selves and be
thankful, worshipping and adoring that God which so mercifully deals with
us. Again, when GOD vouchsafes signs of his presence, let us haste unto him,
and not suffer him to pass away whilst we are hindered with this and that.
He gives signs of his presence in the Word preached, he gives signs of
his presence in my heart by good motions. O let him not pass away, but make
haste as Moses here did, bow down and worship etc.

7 Moses said, O Lord, I pray thee, if I have found favor Ver. 9.
in thy sight, that the LORD would now go with us, for it is a stiff-necked
people, etc. The promises of God kindle prayer, and see it in Moses here,
wherefore use (when you are dull to pray) to meditate a time upon the promises
of GOD general, particular, so many, so sweet, so full of power to inflame an
heart half dead, and when you feel the fire kindle, then pray, it will flame
out at last. His prayer is for assistance in his charge, and well notes the
heavy burden of Government which so many desire yt little think of ye weight.
Domosthenes said if there were two ways before him, the one leading to
Government, and the other to death, he would take that which leads to death
before the other. Aeschines desired to be delivered from Government as from a
mad dog. Traian said, who knew the cares of an Emperors Crown, would not take
it up in the way if he found it there. Such, and many such Speeches read we, al
to note the great charge, and to snubbe the vain ambition of Man. Yet
Government is of God, and God in Governors, and is honored greatly, ever was,
and will be.

9 Keep diligently that which I command thee Ver. 11.
this day, and behold I will cast out before thee the Amorites, etc. Who
subdueth enemies and casts them out? God, and God only; man is but by his
means, and prevails and fails as the Lord will. Why does God subdue? That
we may keep and keep diligently what he commands, do this and prosper, as
shall be good ever; do it not, and vain shall all strength be, when the
Lords patience is expired, and Justice taken in hand. Publicly and privately
this is true, think of it.

9 Take heed thou make no compact with the inhabitants Ver. 12.
of the land, whither thou go, lest they be the cause of thy ruin among
you. It seems cruel, if the inahbitants would yield and submit themselves,
not to receive them. But learn here and ever, that God is the true line of
mercy, and where he condemns beware pity: For that is to condemn him, and
to exalt thy self above him in mercy. Because, says the Prophet to Benhadad,
thou have let him go whom I appointed to die, thy life shall go 1. King. 20.
42.
for his life, and thy people for his people. Lest (says this Text) they be
the cause of thy ruin. False Religion (you see) in the end works
destruction, and how then is it policy? how better for a Commonwealth, as
some Romish Catholics vainly have written? Thirdly, Thou shall Ver. 13.
overthrow their Altars, etc. Then no tolleration to be had of two Religions in
one Government. If the Lord be God, he must be worshipped, but if Baal be he,
he must be worshipped 1. King. 18. 21.
solely and only, not GOD and Baal both. Thou shall worship the Lord thy God,
and him only shall thou Mat. 4. 10.
serve. God is a ielous God, and will not give his glory to another. David a
Prince truly religious says, Their Ps. 16. 4.
offerings of blood will not I offer, neither make mention of their names
within my lips. Princes destroying Idolatry and purging the Church, are
renowned in Scripture with a blessed memory. Solomon for his mingling was
plagued. Valentinian sought of Ambrose a Church in Millan for the Arrians, and
Ambrose denied it etc. But by whom are the Altars to be broken down? By the
Magistrate only, or by private men also, and by every one that is zealous?
Surely public things by public persons in authority, Constantine,
Theodosius and such like. But for private things, private men may do them, as
Jacob purged his own house of his Wives Idols. And Eusebius. lib. 3.
the Council condemns Masters that will suffer in their Council. Arelatens.
Canon.
houses images, and not take them away. Private men to meddle with public
things is dangerous. Paul came to Athens, and found an Altar, yet he threw it
not down. The Council decreed, that he which (being not a Magistrate) Council.
Eliberin.
should break down an Image and be slain in the fact, should not be numbered
among Martyrs. Theodoret makes mention of Auda a Bishop who overthrew Pyreum
Persarum, and says thus, that a private man ouerthrewe this, I praise it not,
etc. Extraordinary instincts God has given, but let men take heed they be not
deceived. Gideon had Gods instinct, every motion to such matters must not be
such a warrant. Ambrose defends the Bishop that burned the Jewish Synagogue,
Ambrose. Epist. 24.
and reckons one among Martyrs which, in the time of Julian, threw down an
Altar and was condemned. Our own times have yielded some examples. But you
see, all are not of one mind. Therefore beware of false spirits that will
rashly write of reformation without tarrying for the Magistrate. So every man
may be a Magistrate, and the sweet society of man with man turned to blood
and slaughter. Some yet are too mild, and they tell us Idolatry must first
be taken out of the heart by true teaching etc. They say well, that true
teaching goes before, but what then? Therefore is the Magistrates work
excluded? No. For, are not the sins against the second Table also to be taken
out of the heart by teaching? and yet I hope the magistrate may concur with
teaching, and punish thieves, and murderers, and adulterers etc: Much more in
the first Table touching Gods honor and service.

10 Marriage with th^se Idolaters is forbidden, and I wish it marked: I have else
where touched it, and the curse of God is often so great upon such matches, as
I wonder at the presumptuous provoking of Gods wrath that I see in many. A
Recusants living is respected, and body and soul destroyed for ever. The
father wilful throws his dear child away, and never thinks of the
judgment he shall have with God at his fearful day for the same. I know
where I am, and I stay. God in mercy work feeling and true repentance.
Tertullian persuades Christian Widows to take heed of these marriages.
Solomon was overthrown by them etc.

11 When Moses came down from the mountain, Ver. 29. and. 30. Hoc signo and
intollerabilis diuini iudicij splendour adumbrari debuit, and legis divinae
operatio, quae conspicientibus peccata sua terrorem incutit. At per velamen,
cum naturae nostrae caligo, tum Iudaeorum excecatio, de qua anagogice. 2. Cor.
3. 13. etc. Mys^ice exposuerunt: Orig. Ho. 12. in Exodus Ambros. in Psalm. 118.
Greg. lib. 28. Moral. Cap. 23. etc. 2. Cor. 3.
Aaron and all the children of Israel looked upon him, and behold the skin of
his face shone bright, and they were afraid to come near him. Diverse and
sundry causes might cause the Lord thus to change Moses face. First, to assure
him by this outward token, that his prayers were accepted and Gods favor
again restored to the people. Secondly, that thus the law written in the two
Tables now the second time, and Moses also the Minister of the law, might
receive authority and dutiful regard with the people. Thirdly, that it might
note Moses to shine with heavenly knowledge and Wisdom, instructed by the Lord
for the good of the people. Fourthly, to note that Ministers faces, that is,
their outward actions and words (which appear to men) should glister and
shine. So let your light shine, that me^ may see your good works etc. Fifthly,
to shadow that the law which Moses now represented, is only bright and shining
in the face, that is, outwardly, for the righteousness of them that observe
the law for outward actions, is only a seeming justice, shining before men,
who look no further than to the out-ward appearance; but before God (who sees
the heart and reins) it is none: Whereas the righteousness of Christ is all
glorious within and without. Sixthly, to teach that the law lightneth the
conscience which is as the face of ye in-ward man, making it see and know
sin; but the mind it lightneth not which any faith to save from sins,
Christ only doing that by his holy Spirit, etc. Therefore the people fear,
and dare not approach, the law ever striking a terror into the hearts of them
that behold their sins in it, and by it. Moses himself (says your Chapter)
knew not of this glory of his face. And modest men are not carried away with
knowledge of their own gifts, but are as it were ignorant of them. Socrates
when all men judged him most learned, yet of himself held this both thought,
and speech, That he knew nothing. And in matter of our alms, the Lord bids,
That the right hand know not what the left hand does.

12 Moses put a covering over his face, etc. For the Ver. 33.
signification whereof you may read S. Paul 2. Cor. 3. 7. It was figure of the
Cover that is over our understanding till the Lord take it away, whereby we are
not able to discern the things of God. Pray we therefore ever, that as our
Savior has come out of the bosom of his Father to reveal all truth, and
has in his holy Word perfectly taught the same; so he would be pleased to open
our eyes, to bore our ears, and to soften our hearts, that we may receive to
our endless comfort what he has revealed. Thus much of this Chapter.

CHAP. 35.
THese last six Chap. following do but repeat how those things were done which
GOD in the former Chapters commanded to be done; and therefore need not
further to be stood upon, the chief things in them having been before spoken
of: As, in the twenty fifth Chapter you have this Chapter, and so on, if you
co^ferre them together. Only I will remember two or three things out of the
Fathers, not noted before (as I take it) in the 25. Chapter. The first is an
earnest and an aftionate Speech of Origin Ho. 13. in Exodus Domine Jesus, praesta
mihi, vt aliquid monime^ti habere queam in tabernaculo tuo. Ego optarem (si
fieripotest) esse aliquid meum in illo auro, ex quo Propitiatorium fabricatur,
vel ex quo Arca co^tegitur, vel ex quo candelabrum fit luminis et lucernae: aut
si aurum non habeo et argentu^, salte^ aliquid inueniar offerre, quod proficiat
in columnas et bases earu^: aut certe vel aris aliquid habere queam in
Tabernaculo vnde circuli fiant, et caetera quae sermo diuinus describit. Utinam
mihi esset possibile vnum esse ex Principibus, et offere gemmas ad ornamentum
pontificis humeralis atque (...). Sed quia haec supra me sunt, certe vel pilos
capraru^ habere merear in Tabernaculo Dei, tantum ne in omnibus ieiunus et
infoecundus inueniar. Lord Jesus, grant that I may have some monument in thy
Tabernacle. I would wish, if it could be, that some part of that gold might
come from me whereof the propitiatory is made, or with which the Arc is
covered, or whereof the Candlestick is made, or if I have no gold or silver, at
the least I may be found to offer some thing that may help froward the pillars
and sockets of them: or that I may have some brass in the Tabernacle, whereof
the rings may be made, and other things prescribed by thy Word. O that it were
possible for me to be one of the Princes, and to offer precious stones to the
adorning of the Priests garment! But because al these are above my power, at
the least let me find favor to offer goats hair in the Tabernacle of God,
that I be not found empty and unfruitful in all. Let this devout Speech much
move thee good Reader. The second thing is, concerning the skillful workmen
Bezaleel and Aholiab. For the first being well descended of the honorable
tribe of Judah, and the 2. not so well, but from a more unnoble tribe, yt tribe
of Dan, it affoordeth us this good observation; yt God bestows not his gifts
ever according to birth, but makes them in virtue equal whom earthly respect
and humane descent have made very unequal. Neither does he yield them praise
for birth, but for gifts and graces of his Spirit in themselves, and for a
singular ability to teach others, which every man cannot do, either by some
impatiencie in his nature, or for sloth, or for one thing or other. Uery well
therefore said S. Hierom, Summa apud Deum nobilitas clarum esse virtutibus:
nescit religio nostras personas, nec co^ditiones ho^inu^, sed animas inspicit.
In Epist. ad Caelantiu^. It is the chiefest nobility with God, to be endued
with virtue: Religion knows not our persons, neither does it look upon the
conditions of men, but upon their minds. Thirdly, in the example of these
worthy workmen, is notably commended unto us the virtue of agreement and
consent in the Lords work, that they join and are not severed: A thing of
great consequence if I would follow it by discourse. But God make us all follow
it in our places: their faithfulness in not converting any thing to their own
use, and many other good things might be noted in them: but I stay.

CHAP. 36.
Turn back to the 31. Chapter for the explanatio^ of this Chapter, concerning
these workmen thus raised up of God, and enabled with skill for this great
work. In this place note the singular liberality of the people to this house
of God, when they brought so much that they were stayed and stopped from
bringing Verse. 6.
any more. O, where are these hearts now a days? Note also the rare
faithfulness of the workmen, who gave notice of this bounty, and said, verse.
5. It was more than needed, being much of it gold, and precious stones, and
costly things. What might they in such plenty have put aside for their private
profit, if they had been men of such a stamp? Thirdly, see the Magistrate in
this matter, how he also will not have the people further charged than is cause,
when once he knows of it. All these are examples to us, to learn in our
several places to do the like, that with God and man we may reap like
commendation.

CHAP. 37. 38. 39.
Read oueragaine the 25. 36. 27. Chapters, where these things now repeated
are explaned.

CHAP. 40.
Observe how often in this Chapter is repeated (as the Lord commanded,) and
see how sweet commanded obedience is. Were it as sweet to God to be served
with inventions, never would these Repetitions be made. Beware therefore of
these ways, and in very reason conclude, that if you look of your servant
service according to your will, and not according to his; much more may God.
And if your commandment be a discharge to your servant, much more is God to
his a sure rest and comfort.

2 Consider here what Saint Augustine notes: Moses Aug. Quaest. in Leuit.
that is appointed to anoint and consecrate others, was never anointed and
consecrated himself; that so we might learn not to value external Sacraments
or signs by the dignity of the Minister, but by the ordinance of God. Again,
that the invisible grace is of force without the visible sign, when God will
have it so, as in Moses here.

3 The cloud covered the Tabernacle, and the glory Verse. 34.
of the Lord filled it. That thus he might grace that outward place now
appointed for holy assemblies to serve him, and so to the worlds end teach how
great account all people ought to make of their Churches, and Churchmeetings,
whereof I have spoken before, Chap. 25. The cloud ascended when Verse. 36.
they should travel, and was unto them a direction when to remove: by the day
also it went before Verse. 38.
them, and a fire by night; so day and night the Lord directed them in their
way to Canaan. Blessed were those men (think you) that were thus directed.
And is God now changed? No, no: in his word he is, and by his word he offers
to lead you to the true Canaan in heaven as comfortably, as plainly, and as
powerfully, as he did his people by these outward means, unless you be
wilful and will not follow. Look therefore, in his name I beg it, at his
word: have it, read it, love it, and meditate upon it, and continually (as you
may) exercise your self in it. It will set you at the last where all the
pleasures of the world cannot set you, and from whence you would not come (when
once you are there) for ten thousand millions of such worlds. These helps of
mine to this end accept, and use as the pledges of his love that wishes you
eternal comfort and peace. Read first a Chapter in your Bible, and then read
these Notes upon the same, they will stir up your mind to further
meditation: For who is able to sound the full depth of the Lords word? God that
has no measure in mercy, for his dear sons sake make them profitable unto
you.

Amen; Amen.

IT is Saint Hierome his speech in one place, That almost Singulas fere
syllabas spirare Coelestia sacramenta.
every syllable of this Book of Leuiticus conteyneth a mystery. A great
motive to stir up all God his people, both to the reading of it, and to a
very great observing of whatsoever we read in it. We see by experience, that,
if a man happen to find any old and ancient Monument of some Famous man, that
lived many years ago, with any inscription of old Letters or Characters, how
he reioiceth at it, keeps it, shows it to his friends, and is never weary
of it. Much more should it please us to view and mark the ancient Figures of
this Book, wherein (as in pictures) Jesus Christ, the great King of all Kings,
and the eternal Son of almighty God was set-out and expressed to the world
before he came, and still most profitably noted and known now, when he is
come. Let us therefore begin to read this heavenly Book with comfort, and
continue the same with constancy, to the end. And (most gracious Father) for
thy dear Sons sake, I beseech thee, throw my sins out of thy sight, that
make me utterly unworthy to come nere thy word, much more, both to taste the
sweetness of it my self, and to be a means that others may do the like with
me. And as it has pleased thee to vouchsafe me a place of teaching in thy
Church, with many and many mercies more, and to stir my heart up to this course
of doing some part of my duty in the same; so vouchsafe to give power to my
will, and to enable me with thy grace, that I may see and set down, observe
and note what may be to this end; namely, to work, both in mine own soul,
and in the hearts of thy dear Chosen, knowledge and feeling of thy heavenly
truth, that may be to the praise of thy unspeakable goodness and our own
aeternall comfort for evermore. O grant it, (sweet Lord) grant it, and be
strong in weakness, as thou have promised to be. Let no sin of mine, or of
thy people that shall ever use my poor labors, hinder and hold this mercy
from us.

Amen, Amen.
The like Notes upon every Chapter of the Book of Leuiticus.
CHAP. I.
BEfore you come to the words of the Text, you may consider in your mind, why
God should institute and appoint such a kind of worship as this, hereafter
described in this Book; seeming to be delighted with the slaughter of Cattle,
and living creatures, to his service. And (the rather) I wish you to think of
this point, because we read of some in old times, that by reason hereof, and by
the commandment, and approbation of wars also (wherein men, women, and
children are often slain with great rigor and force) have condemned the holy
Law of God, his sacred and Divine word, as not agreeable to his Nature, who is
all good, and not delighted with slaughter and cruelty, but with loving
mercy, and mildness, unity, amity, and peace. Such were the Cerdonian and
Marcion Heretics, as witness Turtullian, and Augustine. Others have fallen
into this foolish and false conceit, that there were two Gods; one God, the
Father of Christ, and the Author of the new Testament: the other, severe and
sour, cruel and bloody, the Author of the old Testament, wherein so many
commandments, concerning blood by wars, and by sacrifices, are given.
Again, Lucian, that profane Scoffer, scoffed and iested at this kind of
worship by blood, and death. The former folly is so gross and senseless, as
in our days (God be blessed) it needs no confutation. For we well know, that
even the Scriptures of the old Testament also, Came 2. Pet. 1. 21.
not by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the
holy Ghost. We know the Law it self is holy and undefiled, given (as a good
Schoolmaster) Psalm. 19. 7. 8. 9
to lead us unto Christ. And even the whole Scripture together, Old Testament
and New, Law and Gospel, is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable to
2. Tim. 3. 16.
teach, to improve, to correct, and to instruct in righteousness, That the man
of God may be absolute, being made perfect 17.
unto all good works. The other point may be a little touched; namely, his
profaneness, that rested at this worship, and thought it unfit. Wherein
first, let us consider, that not man devised it, and God approved it; but even
God himself both devised it, and accepted it. For the first man Adam, was
taught of God, and he taught his sons, Cain and Abell: otherwise, in Faith
could not Abell have so worshipped; Faith being Heb. 11. 4: Romans 10. 17.
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. So from man to man it proceeded as
the Will of God in all generations, and was used with the godly as the form of
duty, which God required of them and allowed. And now here in your Chapter,
the words are thus. Now Verse 1.
the Lord called Moses, and spoke unto him out of the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, etc, concerning this kind of worship. Whereupon it follows,
that, being his own appointment (who is wisdom it self, justice it self,
and all goodness) flesh and blood, dust and ashes should not dare to censure it,
but as good, although no reason thereof could appear to his understanding.

The singular use of it, and great fitness to the end God appointed it for,
will after appear in the whole Book by noting the particular Sacrifices
mentioned, and commanded. But in the mean time, although God be not bound to
give reasons ever to us of his Will, nor we bound to search out for them, but
humbly and obediently to rest in his good pleasure, made known by his Word:
yet if we think he chose this course to confound the wisdom of the wise, we
shall not think amiss. For all the learned Writings and wise Laws devised by
man, to make people good, could never work so much to that end, as this did,
in such as took the right use of it. The more therefore any despised it, and
thought it folly, the more did it overthrow him in his judgment, and prove
his wisdom to be stark folly.

2 Yet, concerning the continuance of this kind of Worship, the Lord never
intended, it should be perpetual; but only for a time, namely, till that
great Sacrifice (figured and shadowed by all those Sacrifices) should be
exhibited and given unto mankind, according to the Scriptures, with whom all
shadows should cease and take an end. And this was well known to such as
rightly understood the Scriptures, albeit to some others it was not tolerable
doctrine, but very dangerous to be touched. The Prophet David understood it,
when he said, Sacrifice and Offerings thou Psalm. 40. 8. 9.
would not have, but mine ears have thou opened. Sacrifice for sin have
thou not required, then said I, Lo, I come. The Prophet Malachie spoke of it,
when he alleges Mal. 1. 10.
the Lord speaking thus. I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord God of
Hosts, neither will I accept an Offering at your hand. For, from the rising of
the Sun, 11.
unto the going down of the same, my Name is great among the Gentiles, and in
every place (Mark this) Incense shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure
offering: for my Name is great among the Heathen, says the Lord of Hosts.
Agreeable to which place, are the words of Christ to the woman, in the fourth
of John: Woman, John. 4. 21.
believe me, the hour comes, when ye shall neither in this Mountain, nor at
Jerusalem, worship the Father etc. Also the Apostle Paul his words: I will
that the men 1. Tim. 2. 8.
pray, every where, lifting-vp pure hands, without wrath, ^empiterno ritu.
or doubting. Whatsoever therefore you read in the Word of the perpetuity of
this kind and form of worship, you must still take it by restraint, unto the
coming of Christ, and the continuance of that common wealth and policy of the
Jews, not longer.

3 Touching these Sacrifices and Rites, we are to know, and ever remember, that
God never instituted and ordained them to be meritorious, and even by the
workedone (as we say) to appease the wrath of God, and deserve eternal life.
For so thought some Hypocrites in those days, and are sharply, and often
rebuked for it. And the Apostle tells us plain, The blood of Bulls and
Goats cannot take away sin, etc.

4 They were not appointed to be only Allegories of good works, and civil
virtues, and dark deliniaries of a political life, as were the Symbols of
Pythagoras, or the Hieroglyphics of the Egyptians: And yet there may be a fit
application of them this way. For indeed they do shadow-out such virtues, as
the Sacrifice of Christ should work by Faith in true believers, but I say,
they were not instituted only for this purpose, but ye holy Ghost looked at
higher matters in these Ceremonies, namely, that they might shadow-out the Lord
Jesus, the promised Messiah, and the true Son of God, and that Sacrifice
which he should make of himself for the Redemption of all mankind upon the
Cross according to the Scriptures, that they should nourish and maintain the
promises hereof in men's hearts, and that saving Faith hereupon springing in
him, and in him only to be saved for ever. For every Sacrifice was a Sermon of
this matter, of his coming, of his suffering, of his death etc. And by such
visible sights the Gospel was preached, concerning life by him. Thus judged S.
John, when he said, Behold the John 1. 36.
Lamb of God etc. as if he should have said, that Lamb, that was shadowed by
all the Lambs and Sacrifices of the Law. Hitherto tend the words of Saint Paul
to the Ephesians, Christ has loved us, and has given Ephesians. 5. 2.
himself for us, to be an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor
to God. The words of S. Peter; Knowing, 1. Pet. 1. 18.
that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from
your vain conversation received by the tradition of the Fathers: But with the
precious blood 19.
of Christ, as of a Lamb undefiled, and without spot. The words of Saint John,
The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses 1. John. 1. 7.
us from all sin. In the Revelation, The Lamb slain Apoc. 13. (...).
from the beginning of the world. How? Surely not only in the purpose and
appointment of God, but by the Sacrifices which were offered even from the
beginning. For by all such, his death was shadowed, and he as it were slain
(to the faith of man) as often as any Sacrifice was offered. The whole Epistle
to the Hebrews also, in full manner teaches thus much, and mark the words
well in the 10. Chapter. The Law had Hebr. 10. 1.
the shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things.

5 For the variety of them, there were many sorts of sacrifices, and yet but
one Christ, to be signified by them all. This did the Lord in great mercy and
wisdom, that so his people fully busied, and pleased with such variety,
might have neither cause, nor leisure to look unto the wicked Idolatries of
the Heathens, according to the several charges given them of God, To beware
lest Deuteronomy. 12. 30.
they were taken in a snare, to ask after their Gods, saying, how did these
Nations serve their Gods, that I may do so likewise? etc. Seeing all the
abomination that God hates they did unto their Gods, burning both their
Sons and Daughters with fire to their Gods, and the Lord would have them do
only what he commanded, putting nothing unto it, neither taking any thing from
it. Secondly, although Christ be but one, and his Sacrifice but one; yet great
is the fruit, and many several mercies flow from him, and his death unto us.
By him our sins are dashed and washed out, by him Gods wrath against us is
appeased, by him we are adopted and taken for the Sons of God, and
Fellowheires with him, by him we are justified, and endued with the holy Ghost,
enabled thereby to die unto sin, and to live unto righteousness, walking in
his holy Commandments with comfort, and longing for our deliverance out of
this vale of misery, That we may be clothed with our house, which is from
Heaven, etc. Diverse 2. Cor. 5. 1.
sorts of Sacrifices therefore were appointed, to note, by that variety, the
variety of these fruits of Christ to all believers, though he be but one.
Thirdly, and lastly, there were many sorts of Sacrifices, that so plainly the
Church might see, that these kind of Sacrifices were not the true Sacrifices
for sins. For if any one had been able to take away sin, the other had been
in vain added: as the Epistle says to the Hebrews, Those sacrifices which by
the Law were yearly offered, Heb. 10. 1.
could not sanctify the comers thereunto. For then would they have ceased to
have been offered, because the 2
offerers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins, etc.
Therefore, as I say, the variety and multitude of them was of purpose to show
(amongst other things) the insufficiency and weakness of them. In the
second, and 14. verses of this Chapter you may see, and note, of what things
they might offer sacrifice lawfully; Namely, Of Cattle, Beefes, and Sheep,
verse. 2: and, of fowls, Turtle Doves, or young Pigeons, verse Verse. 2.
14. For, what God commanded that only might they lawfully do, neither adding,
nor diminishing. Therefore, detestable before God was that offering of men and
children, that we read of, both amongst Jews and Gentiles. Of the Jews, the
Psalm says, They offered their Sons and Daughters unto Devils. And again,
They shed innocent blood, the blood of their Sons and Daughters, which they
offered up to the Idols of Canaan. Of the Heathens, read how the King of Moab,
in his distress took his Son, and offered him, etc. 2. Kings, 3. 27
Lactantius de falsa religione lib. 1. cap. 21. Eusebius. de preparatione Euang.
lib. 4. cap 7. Arnob. lib. 8. Aug. de ciuitate Dei. lib. 7. cap. 14. See more
examples of this cruelty.
Happily these Heathens had it from the Patriarchs, that a man should come, by
whose Sacrifice Gods wrath should be appeased: and they not understanding how
that should be, namely by Christ, founded thereupon this bloody cruelty to
offer up men and children in sacrifice. Or else, in their reason, they framed
this argument, that if Sacrifices of Beefes, sheep, and fowls, were
acceptable to God, much more must needs be offerings of men. But it was not so,
the Lord commanding the one, and abhorring the other. Concerning these lawful
Sacrifices, a good Note is given; that forasmuch as God is pleased, to receive
his Sacrifices of such things, as man has for his common meat, beef, and
sheep, etc. Why should vile earth and ashes so hunt for delicacies to pamper
up their sinful bodies, as they do, never thinking any thing dainty enough,
that may be gotten for the things sacrificed. Ea sibi sacrificari Theodoret in
Leuit. q. 1.
iussit Deus, quae ab Egyptijs pro Deo coluntur: nempe, de numero quadrupedu^,
Vitulum, Capram, and Ouem, e volatilibus, Tu^turem, and pullos Columbarum etc.
vt sacrificijs destinata ne Deos putarent, sedeum solum adorarent, cui conuenit
ista offerri. Sic de immundis. etc. God would have these things sacrificed unto
him, which the Egyptians worshipped for Gods: to wit, of four* footed
creatures, the Calfe, the Goat, the Sheep; of souls, the Turtle Dove, young
Pigeons, etc. that being thus appointed for sacrifice, the Israelites might
well know, and see, that they were no Gods: but that they ought to worship him
only, to whom all these things were offered. So of unclean things etc.

If his Sacrifice be a whole burnt offering of the heard, Verse. 3.
he shall offer a Male without blemish, etc. Here begin the several sorts and
kinds of Sacrifices, and first is named the burnt Offering, and 3. sorts
thereof. One of the heard, in this verse; A second of the Flock, verse 10. and
the third, of fowls, verse 14. Concerning the first kind, you may observe
first, in what case it was used: and secondly, with what rites, and after what
sort. It was used both by the ancient Patriarchs, and their succeeding
posterity, cheefely in the agonies of their consciences, in their worldly
distresses, and their greatest In magnis co^scientiae pauoribus. In grauibus
re^u^ difficultatibus. In timore periculoru^. etc.
fears, to confirm their faith in God his assured assistance, when, and how
his good pleasure should be, that he would not forget them, forsake them, and
leave them, but surely, and mercifully he present with them, look upon them,
and help them to their contentment and comfort. When the Flood was ceased, and
Noah should enter out of the Arc, to comfort his heart after such a great
danger, and heavy judgment of an angry God, upon all flesh, and to assure his
soul of Gods gracious favor, to continue toward him, for future times, as it
had mightily showed it self for the time passed, He built an Altar to the
Lord, and took of every Genesis 8. 20.
clean beast, and of every clean foul, and offered a whole Burnt Offering
upon the Altar. The Lord, pleased therewith, gave him comfort accordingly, and
promised no more so to curse the ground again for man's cause, neither 21.
any more to smite all things living, as he had done. 22.
From thence forth there should be again seede-time and harvest, cold and
heat, Summer and Winter, day and night, should not cease so long as the earth
remained. When the Israelites endeavoring to revenge that great wickedness of
the Beniamites to the Levites wife, and were twice fearfully overthrown by
the Beniamites, then Judge. 20. 26.
they went up to the house of God, and wept, and fasted, and offered Burnt
Offerings, etc. When the Philistines came up against Israel to fight with them,
and the Israelites 1. Sam. 7. 8. 9.
were sore affraide, then Samuel offered a Burnt Offering to confirm and
comfort them, and behold the effect; the Lord thundered with great thunder upon
the Philistines, and scattered them, so that they were slain before Israel.
When that great plague was amongst the people, for David's sin in numbering the
people, then in that grief of mind, and woe of heart for his own fault, and
the peoples death, David bought the threshing floor of Aranah, etc. And
offered Burnt Offerings 2. Sam. 24. 24 25.
unto the Lord, whereupon his comfort followed: The Lord was appeased toward
the Land, and the plague ceased from Israel. Thus might I weary you with
Examples, but I will add but one more, the example of Solomon, who being
brought of God, to the Kingdom of his father David, and wisely weighing the
great charge and burden of it, as also his own want of experience, and skill,
to guide so great a ship, troubled and perplexed in his heart, betwixt a desire
to do well, and a fear to light short of what he desired, through his own
weakness, got him in this agony to his God, and offered Burnt Offerings,
which likewise had effect to his joy, the Lord saw him, and heard him, and gave
him both wisdom for his charge (which he 1. Kin. 3. 4. 12. 13.
only begged,) and riches and honor, (which he begged not:) so that before
him was never such a one, neither after him should ever be the like. See then,
as I said, the use of this kind of Sacrifice in all fears, and troubles, when
comfort was wished, and a strong stable heart in Gods promises, till the time
of the same co(...)fort came, without fainting, or falling away.

Secondly, after observation, in what case the burnt Offering was used, let us
consider the manner and circumstances of it, which likewise you see in this
third Uerse, etc. First, it must be of the Herd or flocks (if it were a
beast) not a wild Heart, Bore, Bear, Woolf, etc. For these kind of creatures
being fierce, savage, cruel, and by force brought to death, not otherwise,
could not be figures and shadows of a meek, mild, sweet, and gracious
Savior, who willingly and lovingly should even lay down his life for us; that
we by his death might be saved. Secondly, it was required 2
to be a Male. The Male is stronger, and perfecter than the Female, and
therefore fitter to shadow and show the strength, and perfection of Christ in
vanquishing sin, death, druill, and hell, which the mightiest Monarche, the
earth ever had, could never do. Thirdly, 3
it was required, that it should be without blemish, that is, not blind, not
lame, nor broken, and so forth, as you may read, Leuit. 22. ver. 22. which
when the Jews observed not, see how the Lord complains, Malachie, 1. 8. If
any man think these bodily imperfections small things to be regarded of God,
it is very true: but for an express commandment of God to stubbornely broken
by dust and ashes that should obey, is no small matter. If we look at the
Apple eaten by our first Parents, it was but an Apple, a matter of small
moment; but when the Commandment said, no, and yet they did it, their fault
was not small, and so the punishment showed. Therefore ever in the
Commandments of God, we must not regard so much the thing, as his Will, who
(being our maker) may command what he will, and his will being ever just, holy,
wise, and for our good, if we have grace, ought to be obeyed precisely,
carefully, and cheerfully. This condition of the burnt Sacrifice figured out
the purity of that Lamb, that indeed had no blemish any way, no guile found
in his mouth, but so clean as by his cleanness, his righteousness being
imputed unto us, his Spirit daily works our Sanctification, and newness of
life from sin and uncleanness. Fourthly, your Chapter says, it must be
presented of voluntary will, so to figure 4
out that Christ should willingly (not constrainedly) give himself to death
for mankind; and, peradventure also, to show that God never likes of
constreyned service, but will have men do their duties to him voluntarily, as
indeed is fit of the creature to the Creator ever. Fifthly, it must be presented
at the door of the 5
Tabernacle, God tying them to a place appointed by him, and not suffering them
to sacrifice where they listed themselves in every place. Deuteronomy. 12. 13. 14. as
in Leuit. 17. 4. 2. Chron. 28. 29. Ezech. 6. Ose. 4.
the Margin the places are noted. If this thought come in your mind, why God
should thus tie them to a place, when as (for the shadowing of Christ, and
confirming the faith of the Godly) it seems rather, it should have been
lawful every where to sacrifice, because every where Christ is a comfort to
all believers, and Faith in all places should receive her appointed helps, to
make strong and stable from despair, or doubt. You again may remember, that
there were two reasons chiefly of this Commandment. The first, is expressed in
Leuit. Chap. 17. ver. 3. etc. Namely, that by this means, they might be stayed
from using any unlawful manner in their Sacrifices, and from following the
fashions of their adjoining neighbors, the Heathens, which happily they might
have done, if in every place, at their pleasure, they might have sacrificed.
The second reason was, to signify by this means, that he only was the true
Sacrifice for sin, whom that Mercy seat, there in the Tabernacle, did
represent, and which in that place, where after the Temple should be built, to
wit, in Jerusalem, should offer himself for our sins. If you ask whether (by
this example) at this day, a certain place be requisite? you may remember,
that, even by this example and true experience, wisely our Elders have both
thought of and provided, that in every Parish there should be a public place,
even a Church or Chapel, whither, (except in case of necessity) all people
of that Limyt, should come to perform their duties to God, publicly after
one manner, not allowed at their will, every one to have a several place, lest
private places should breed private fancies, errors, and heresies, schisms,
and deuisions in the Church. Sixthly, upon 6.
the Burnt Offering, you read here, they must lay their hand even upon the head
of it. verse. 4. And diverse good things were taught hereby to them that
understood rightly those Ceremonies, then used. For first, the party bringing
that Sacrifice did by this means acknowledge, that he himself deserved to dye;
but (by the mercy of God) he was spared, and his desert laid upon the beast,
for which he ought to be thankful. Secondly, as that beast then was to die for
him, and to be offered in Sacrifice; so did he believe Christ should come, and
die for him. Thirdly, that it is not enough to believe that Christ should come,
and die for sin, but he must put his hand upon Christ, that is, lay upon him
all his iniquities, by the hand of his Faith; apply Christ to himself, and
believe that he must die then, and we now, that he has dyed for his sins,
my sins, your sins, etc, Being the only propitiation for sin. The Jews
put their hand upon the works of the Law, the Heathens upon their devised
worships, Hypocrites upon their alms, fasts, prayers, etc, Making these things
satiffactorie to God for them, and so wronging the Lord Jesus, and his
All-powerfull blood. Fourthly, this laying on the hand showed, that men
bringing Sacrifices to God, should rather sacrifice themselves, and all their
exorbitant affections, than that beast. For many are content to give their
goods to God, but themselves to the devil, which God abhors. Lastly, this
Ceremony taught them, of what mind they should be when they offered; namely,
of this, that they thought the favors and mercies of God so great and gracious
toward them, that if they should even offer themselves to the death for him,
and indeed dye as that beast must, yet no recompense would that be, worthy
such a loving Lord, and answerable to such his great kindness. When it is said
in the Text, that such sacrifice should be axcepted to the Lord, to be his
atonement, verse 4. and in the 9. verse. for a sweet savor unto the Lord, or a
savor of rest, which pacifieth the anger of the Lord, these promises being no
deceiuings of men, but true, as ye Promise-maker is ever true: We must note and
consider, that there was a satisfying power in those Legal sacrifices, whereby
the right Offerer was loosed and cl^ered from guilt in the sight of God: not
that brute creatures of themselves could do thus, but as they were true
figures of Christ and grace by him to be obtained, and had sacramentally.
Therefore they satisfied and helped, or reconciled to God, as at this day we
are washed sacramentally by Baptism. Profitable then no further, but as they
were exercises to true repentance, and faith, that sinners might learn to
fear the wrath of God, and to seek salvation in Christ, and Christ only.
Seventhly, the burnt Offering was slain, 7.
to fore show the death of Christ. O fools, and slow of heart, says our
Savior, to believe all that the Prophets Luke 24. 25. 26. 27.
have spoken; Ought not Christ to have suffered those things, and to enter into
his glory? And he began at Moses and all the Prophets, and thoroughly
interpreted unto them. etc. Now think with your self, wherein, Moses (that is,
the Law) did so show the death of Christ, as by these deaths and killings of
the Sacrifices? But who offered the slain sacrifice? any but the Priest? No:
that so it might be shadowed, how that there is no power in man to please God,
but by the chief and high Priest Christ Jesus, of whom the Leuiticall Priest
was a type and a figure. Eighthly, the Priests sons offered the 8. Verse 5.
blood, and sprinkled it round about upon the Altar, that is, by the door of
the Tabernacle of the Congregation. The blood, noting the death of Christ, and
the sprinckling the preaching of it through the world. Ninthly, the burnt
Offering was flayed, and the skin plucked off, then was it cut in pieces,
verse. 6. Hereby was noted the great and grievous bitterness of Christ his
Passion, who should (for ma^s sake) be stripped-out of all humane help, and
made as bare and naked of all worldly glory, show, credit, and estimation with
men, as this Sacrifice was turned out of his skin. Remember what you read in
the Psalm, spoken of Christ in the person of David. I am a worm and no man; a
shame of men, Psalm. 22. 6. 7.
and the contempt of the people. All they that see me, have me in derision:
they make a mow, and nodde the head, saying, He trusted in the Lord, let him
deliver him, 8.
let him save him, seeing he loves him: And so forth, as follows in the
Psalm. Add unto it what you read in Esaias, He has neither form nor beauty:
when we Esaias 53. 2.
shall see him, there shall be no form that we should desire him. He is
despised and rejected of men, etc: we hid 3.
our faces from him, he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Both which
Prophecies are Expositions of this shadow, and may truly tell us, how his
skin was plucked of. An other use there might be to the party that Offered
the burnt Sacrifice, even to teach him to pulloff his skin, and to offer
himself up to the Lord flayed, and without skin, that is, without all
counterfeit and bypocriticall shows, without all earthly, vain, and proud
confidence in himself, or any works or virtue, or worth whatsoever in him, but
naked and bare to present himself to his God, that is with a single, a simple,
a true, and a faithful heart, boasting of no desert, but humbly craving mercy
and pardon, and life for the true Sacrifice sake, Christ Jesus, who in time
should come, and so suffer for man's sins, to set him free. And surely thus
still must we be flayed and skinned in all our prayers, and approachings to
God, or else we shall deceive our selves, and be disappointed of our desire.
The proud Pharisce in the Gospel was not thus, but came John 15.
with his skin on: and let his example teach us. The poor Publican was
flayed, and came with skin off; let it comfort, and encourage us. Tenthly,
your Chapter 10
says, And the sons of Aaron the Priest, shall put Verse 7.
fire upon the Altar, and lay the wood (in order) upon the fire. Then the
Priests, Aarons sons, shall lay the parts 8.
(in order,) the head and the kall upon the wood that is in the fire upon the
Altar. In that, body, and head, and all was laid in the fire, it might note how
whole Christ should suffer for us; that is, Christ wholly, both in body and
soul, for our bodies and souls that had sinned; and so, you know, Christ did,
verifying, and fulfilling the Figure. Again, by the head, might be understood
himself; and by the parts, his Church and members; all in the fire and all
burnt together, that it might be showed, the suffering of Christ to belong to
his Chosen, both Tam fr^^^u quam sens^.
in fruit, and sense. The fruit is his taking away of their sins. The sense
is their suffering also with him, and for him, which is fit, when it shall be
his blessed pleasure, and allotted to us but in mercy, that so suffering Romans
8. 17. 2. Tim. 2. 10. Coloss. 1. 24.
with him, we might also reign with him eternally in his Kingdom. The
Disciple is not greater than his Master, etc. Matthew. 10. 24. And Blessed is the
man whom God corrects, therefore refuse not thou the chastising of the Job.
5. 17.
Almighty. For he makes the wound, and binds it 18.
up; He smites, and his hands make whole again, etc. So says S. James
again, Blessed is the man that endures Iam. 1. 12.
temptation; for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of Life, which
the Lord has promised to them that love him. Thirdly, in the fire might be
shadowed the power of the Spirit; and this Lesson so learned, that as the fire
gave those Legal Sacrifices their savor, and was (as it were) the sauce that
made them taste well: so is the Spirit, to all our duties, the means to season
them, and give them liking with the Lord. Pray then without Spirit, and what is
it? Hear the Word preached without Spirit. and what do you? Receive the
Sacrament without this working Spirit, and how can you do well? Mark it
therefore that all Sacrifices had either all, or part, burned with fire, etc.
We know not (says the Apostle) what to pray as we Romans 8. 26. 16.
ought, but the Spirit helps our infirmities etc. The Spirit bears
witness to our spirit, that we are the children of God. If any man have not
the Spirit of Christ, the same 9.
is none of his. The Spirit is life for righteousness sake. 10. 11.
The Spirit shall quicken your mortal bodies; and so forth. This fire
therefore the Lord ever vouchsafe unto us, and we shall do well. Lastly, when
it is said, the wood must be laid in order, the pieces in order, and all in
order: well might they then, and we now observe and learn, how highly God is
pleased with order, and how much he abhors confusion. Wherefore the Apostle,
gives it for a Rule, Let all things be done decently, and in order. And the
more we frame our selves unto good order, the more assurance we ever have, the
Spirit governs us. But the Inwards and the Legs thereof shall Verse 5.
ye wash in water, says your Chapter. The eleventh Circumstaunce in this kind
of Sacrifice, notably 11.
shadowing, how Christ our Savior brought nothing impure or unclean unto his
Passion. as all other men do, when they suffer. For although they suffer
willingly and joyfully, yet do what they can, they shall ever find a law in
their members, rebelling against the law of Romans 7. 23.
their mind, and leading them captive unto the law of sin, which is in their
members. No man therefore can offer a perfect offering to his God for his
sins. Only Christ has, whose Inwards and Legs were washed, that is, who
wholly was pure and immaculate, within and without, and every way. This, This
is my wel-beloued Son, in whom I (and in whom only I) am well pleased.
Lastly, this burnt Offering, in this sort used and offered, 12.
was a sweet savor unto the Lord, says the Text. Not that God is delighted,
as man, with any outward savor: but because first, being done according to his
prescript, he accepted it, and liked it; and secondly, he saw in it his slain
Son, and smelled, as it were, his obedience, which though it was fulfilled in
time, yet was with God from the beginning, as he was also slain from the
beginning. Thus have you viewed the Ceremonies of the first kind of Burnt
Sacrifices taken from the Herd. Consider of them again, and often; the Lord
being entreated shall make them profitable to you.

The second kind of Burnt-offerings.
ANd if his Sacrifice for the Burnt-offering be of the Verse 10.
Flocks, (as of the Sheep, or of the Goats,) he shall offer a Male without a
blemish, etc. The first kind was of the Herd, as you have seen; now the
second is of the Flocks, where again you may note the Ceremonies before in
the other kind observed, and let that Exposition serve here without any
repetition again of the same things. One thing here is, which was not before
touched, namely, how they shall kill it on the Verse 11.
North-side of the Altar, not on any side indifferently, but on the North-side
only; which was done assuredly, to draw this his people from the idolatry of
the Gentiles, who worshipped the Sun in many places, and therefore ever in
their services turned them toward the place where the Sun was, as in the
morning to the East, at midday to the South, at night to the West. And matters
of great moment they would refer to the judgment of the Sun. The Persians
in choice of a Iustine.
King, agreed that all should meet at a place on Horseback betimes, and whose
Horse first neighed before the rising of the Sun, he should be King. For they
took the Sun for a God, and Horses with them were consecrated to the Sun, as
things pleasing to him. In Tyrus, when servants and slaves had cruelly slain,
by treachery and villainy, their Masters and all Freemen, they forsooth would
make a King of themselves, and how? Even thus, they would all assemble before
the Sun, and he that could first see the Sun arise, he should be King, as
chosen out by that their God, the Sun. These toys, lest the Israelites
should learn of their neighbors the Heathens, God, not only by words, and
express prohibitions, but also by such signs Deus. 4.
as this, would teach and instruct them. On the North-side therefore must this
Burnt-offering be killed.

2 This Ceremony might admonish them, that the full Sun, Christ Jesus, was
not yet risen unto them, but (in time) he should come and shine in his
strength. For these Sacrifices and Legal Rites, were but as little candels that
gave some small light, and a far more excellent Light should they expect,
that believed, in due time. And now, I pray you, has it not appeared, and with
his glory put out all these dim Lights of the Law? We know it, and find it,
with thankfulness ever may we think of it. For he that reserved us for these
times, and these times for us, could have made us be borne, and to have our
being in the darkest times.

But now this Ceremony of turning to the North is gone, and we may turn any
way, and please God. The time is come, when the true worshippers shall worship
in Spirit, and truth, every where and every way, lifting up pure hands unto
God, Thus much would our old Fathers signify by the placing of the upper end
of our Churches Eastward, not Northward, which they would not have done, if
they had thought this Ceremony had bound men still. Let us then use things
indifferent, indifferently, and not unto any superstition, or sin.

The third kind of Burnt-offering.
1 ANd if his Sacrifice be a Burnt-offering to the Lord of Verse 14.
Fowls, then he shall offer his Sacrifice of the Turtle-Doues, or of the young
Pigeons. Behold, the third sort of burnt Offerings taken neither of the Herd
nor of the Flocks, but of the Fowls, wherein first, the Lord, (by variety)
did meet with the variable and mutable nature of man, and so kept that people
from lusting after the fashions of the wicked. Secondly, he mercifully regarded
and provided for the poor that should not be able to offer the former sorts,
and so might have been discomforted with it. This appears Chap. 5. verse. 7.
11. and 14. 21. 22.

2 But of Fowls you see here, not all sorts might be offered, as Geese,
Cocks, and unclean Fowls whereof you read els-where, but Turtles and
Pigeons. Which Fowls long before this time God appointed Abraham to offer,
Genesis 15, (Happily) because these most aptly figured Christ, In whom was all
holy simplicity, patience, innocence, etc.

3 Concerning the Rytes, your Chapter specifieth Verse 15.
them in this sort. The Priest shall wring the neck of it a sunder, (or, pinch
it with his nail,) so as not the head should be quite plucked of, but wounded,
that the blood might go out, and the creature die. Thus was the Passion of
Christ shadowed out, whose blood was shed, and he dyed, yet his head not
plucked from his body. And his head not plucked from his body, to signify he
should not be taken from his Church, which is his body, by any death, but raise
himself up again, and be with his to the end of the world. Thus then the
Elect of God comfort themselves, both in aflictions of the world, and in death
it self: that forasmuch as their Head thus lives, and never was, nor can ^e
plucked of from them, therefore as he has overcome, so shall they by him
overcome both the malice of the world, and the power of Satan, and enter into
joy with him for evermore.

4 The Maw and feathers were not offered, but castaway as unclean, so still
noting that which I have often noted, the purity of ye Lord Jesus, our true
Sacrifice.

5 The Priest did cleave it with his wings, but not divide it in sunder, again
to shadow, that though Christ dyed, yet he was not quite extinguished, but
should rise again, and live. To which end also it was that not a bone of him
was broken, as were theirs that dyed with him. That being also figured in the
Paschall Lamb.

Lastly, it is repeated here, for a sweet favor unto the Lord, and not in
vain, but to the great comfort of all such poor offerers. For thus are they
assured, that albeit they were not of ability to offer unto him Oxen, and
Sheep, or sacrifices of great cost, yet were they as dear to him, as those
that could so do, and their Sacrifice of Turtles, or two Pigeons, yielded as
sweet a savor. O sweet still! for this God is not changed, but the same for
ever, and therefore still even two mites of a poor widow graciously accepted,
still a little spice, a little Goats-haire, or what my power is to bring unto
him, is accepted. So that I have no cause to grieve at my poverty, if my heart
be sound, and therefore look unto that, and be cheerful in this.

Thus have you viewed this Chapter. And now a little (with your self,) think
of the manner of Revelation then, and now. What a dark and dim light (I say
again) was that to this vouchsafed unto us now? Surely, so dark, as the
Apostle fears not to call that Night, and ours Day: saying, The night is
gone, the day is come. God, for his Christ his sake, make us thankful.

But now that these kinds of burnt Offerings and Sacrifices are gone, is there
no sort left unto us Christians? yes indeed. First, it is a Sacrifice to God 1
Holocaustum Deo gratissimum praedicare Euangelium.
most exceptable, To preach the Gospel, and it is even as that song which
David speaks of, pleasing the Lord better than a young Bullock, that has
horns and hoofes. Thus S. Paul offered up the Gentiles to God for a sacrifice,
winning the^ by his Ministry unto the truth. Romans 15. verse 16. A Sacrifice so
far passing all others, as man passes all brute beasts. And the faithful
Preachers of the Gospel daily do the like. Secondly, it 2 Praecipuum
holocausti genus.
is a Chief kind of burnt Offering for Christians, To believe in Jesus Christ
by the Gospel; because he that believes, offers Christ daily to God for his
sins, than the which nothing can be more pleasing to Christ and his Father.
Think of it early, and think of it late, when you are upon your knees,
desiring mercy and pardon, favor and comfort, both presently and to death,
yet laden and ouer-laden with a great burden of grievous sins, blemishes,
and imperfections, hateful to God, and hateful to your self, through Grace
given. What hope have you to speed and prevail but by his Sacrifice? you will
take Christ your dear Savior in the arms of your Faith, and say; holy
Father, look upon him, not upon me without him, (For then I dye in justice:)
but upon me in him, and then shall I live in mercy. Thus you offer Christ
daily, and it is the Chiefest Sacrifice still of all believers.

Thirdly, it is another kind of burnt Sacrifice left 3
us, To offer-vp our selves wholly to God, our selves, I say, our souls, and
bodies, a living, holy, and acceptable Sacrifice, enery member to do his Will,
and not ours. Of which S. Paul speaks to the To. Chap. 12. 1.

Fourthly, every good work commanded of God, 4
and done of us in Faith, is a pleasing Sacrifice (in this sort) to God. As
Alms, Coloss. 4. To do justly, to love mercy, and to humble thy self, to
walk with thy God. Mich. 6. verse. 8. To offer spiritual Sacrifices, see S.
Peter. Lastly, all our aflictions patiently endured, 5 Psalm. 51. 17.
according to the Psalm, The Sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit, etc. Do
therefore what God wills, or suffer what he appoints, as you are taught,
and you offer Sacrifice daily to God. Thus let this Chapter profit you.

CHAP. II.
FRom bloody Sacrifices now to Unbloody: and because the Burnt-offering,
described in the former Chapter could not be without the Meat Offering, as you
may see, Number. 15. 4. therefore, before he proceed to other kinds of
Offerings, Moses describes in this Chapter, the Meat Offering, laying down
three sorts of it. The first, The Heads of the Chapter.
Of raw Flesh, verse 1. to the 4. The second, of Flower not raw, but baked,
fried, sodden; verse. 4. to the 14. The third sort, of Corn, not ground to
Flower; verse 14, to the end. For the institution of these Meat Offerings, it
was not because God has need of any meat or smelling savors, in the Psalm
he telling us, that if he be Psalm. 50. 12.
hungry he needs not show us, etc. Neither yet that the deed done might
merit, and turn away Gods anger: For, he that offers an oblation, is as if
he offered Swines blood, and he that remembers incense, as if he blessed an
Idol, says God by his Prophet; but by these the Lord Esaias 66. 3.
would teach to his Church and children, good things concerning Christ their
Savior, and his coming: good Lessons also for life and manners, as by
particulars will appear.

First, This Meat Offering of Flower and Corn might greatly comfort them
touching their labors, and assure them, that yearly God would bless their
Corn, and their fields, because it pleased him to be a partner with them in
those fruits.

2 The Meat Offering of flesh, might draw their hearts to God in all times of
their diet, teaching them that God gives, and God sanctifies, God prospers,
and Ose 2. 21. 22.
is the staff both of bread and meat, They are not upon our tables by chance,
but by his kind providence, and great goodness; and therefore to forget him,
were to become most unworthy of those blessings.

3 The Flower must be fine Flower, to signify still unto them the cleanness
and purity of CHRIST, in whom there was no sin, neither any guile found in
his mouth. Of whom is all purity in any of his members, our foulness being
washed by his blood. It taught also that our best things should be given to
God, and not our worst, as our manner is.

4 The Meat Offering taught, that Christ is the remedy against all hunger. As,
am I grieved with sin, and hunger for righteousness? Christ helps this
hunger, being made righteousness, and wisdom, and sanctification 1. Cor. 1.
30.
and redemption unto us. Am I afraid to die, and hunger for comfort? Christ is
my help for this hunger, and tells me, that blessed are the dead which die
Apoc. 14. 13. John. 1. Cor. 54. 55. 57
in him. He that believes in him shall not die eternally. But though he be
dead, yet shall he live. Death is swallowed up in victory. O Death, where is
thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory? Thanks, Thanks be unto God, which
has given us Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

5 He shall power Oil upon it, and put Incence thereon, Verse 1.
says the Text; Oil delights the taste, and Incense the smelling. Neither
of them cares God for, we know. But thus it pleased him to shadow-out unto his
people, that they should ever serve him according to his own presciption,
which is acceptable, as a good taste or smell is, and not with the unsavory
inventions of their own brain, as hateful unto him, as the other is
pleasing. Again, the Oil noted Christ his kindness and mercy, which he
should ever show to poor penitent sinners, wounded and smitten with woe for
their manifold frailties and sins. He should not be rough unto them, stern
and cruel; but soft as Oil, gracious and kind, sweet and comfortable, ready
to receive them and pardon them. Learn of me, I am meek and lowly in heart,
take my yoke upon you, and Matthew. 11. 29.
you shall find rest unto your souls. For my Yoke is easy, 30.
and my burden is light. Come unto me all ye that are weary and laden, and I
will ease you. 28.


6 Incense again figured out the prayers of Christ for his Church so powerful
with God his Father, that not only he was heard himself, but thereby he
obtained, that whatsoever we should ask in his Name, and for him, we should
receive also. The vain use of Frankincense in Popish Churches, as an imitation
of the Law, is still to love darkness, when God vouch safeth light, still to
continue abolished Ceremonies, and still to be stubborn against God, with a
will worship of our own, neglecting his Will.

And shall bring it unto Aarons sons the Priests; and Verse 2.
he shall take etc. Whatsoever was offered to God must be given into the hand
of the Priest, still representing unto men this Doctrine; That only by Christ
there was access to God, and no way else. According to that plainer Revelation
in the Gospel by himself. No man comes to the father but by me, I am the
way; And, let us therefore by him offer the Sacrifice of praise to God, etc.
Heb. 13. verse 15.

2 A handful of the Flower, and of the Oil, with all Verse 2.
the Incense, and the Priest shall burn it for a memorial upon the Altar, for
it is an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto the Lord. Not all the
Flower, but a handful; not all the Cakes, but one; and not all was burned, but
only a little part of one: the rest went to the Priests, and none could eat
of it but the Priests. It was a Memorial to them, to assure them, that God did
respect the party Offering, and would be merciful unto him. And because it so
pleased God it should be, to him also it was a Memorial, to extend his sweet
goodness to his penitent servant.

3 This Meat Offering you see in your Chapter was either baked, verse. 4. or
fried in the Frying-panne, verse. 5. or sodden in the Caldron, verse. 7: And
which way so-euer it was, three Rules were to be observed, specified The first
Rule.
in the Text. First, It must be without Leaven, verse. 11. In the 7. Chapter,
verse. 13. and in the 22. Chap. verse 20. You may read of a lawful use of
Leaven, but it was never lawful (by the Law) to offer unto GOD for a Sacrifice
any Leauened bread, Leaven being a Figure both of corrupt Doctrine, and bad
life. Beware of Matthew. 16. 6. 11. 12.
the Leaven of the Scribes and Pharisees, that is, of their corrupt Doctrine.
Mat. 16. And let us keep the feast not with old Leaven, neither in the Leaven
of maliciousness and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth. 1. Cor. 5. 8. Leaven noted bad life. Christ the^ being shadowed in all these burnt Offerings, by this Rule of having no Leaven, they were taught
the purity of Christ his Doctrine, and the holiness of his life. His Doctrine
so pure, that it makes others pure. Ye are clean through the Word which I
have spoken John. 15. 3. John 8. 51.
unto you. And, Verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man keep my Word, he
shall not see death. Then you see it makes clean. His life also so pure, that
not only his false accusers could fasten no fault upon him; but by his
innocence he appeased Gods wrath for our impuritie. Again, it taught the
Church in that Legal fashion by dark figure, that after Christ his example
they ought also to be free from both these; to wit, false doctrine, and ill
manes. Not teaching (if they be Teachers,) any corrupt matter, not believing
and holding (if they be no Teachers) and absurd untruths. Neither Teachers nor
People leading a wicked life, but in holiness and righteousness, as the Lord
shall enable, spending all their days. The second Rule is, That The second
Rule.
there he no honey in his Meat Offering made by fire unto the Lord. Of Honey, we
read many things; as, that the nature of it is to preserve bodies, not
suffering them to rot and putrify: That many (by the use of it) live unto a
great age, as namely, in the I Will of Corsica, by Plinies Testemonie, who calls
them long-liuers, only by the daily use of Honey. Honey has a sweet and
pleasing taste, not sharp. Whereupon Solomon says, Fair words are as a honey
comb, sweetness to the soul, Prou. 16. 24.
and health to the bones. My Son, eat Honey, for it is Prou. 24. 13.
good; and the hony-combe, for it is sweet unto the mouth. What might be the
reason then, that God did forbid any honey to be used in this Offering? Answer
is made, that honey, although it be sweet in taste, yet it is bitter by effect.
For it greatly increases, choler, which is as bitter, as the honey is sweet.
Secondly, although honey be good to eat, yet a man may eat too much of it.
Prou. 25. 26. Thirdly, even in taste it will not seem sweet (if you eat
much) but very bitter or sour. Lastly, it has the very nature of Leaven,
being boiled, Mel coctum, vt statim acorem contra^at, panem fermentat. Calvin.
and so having gotten a little sharpness. Now, forasmuch as none of these
things are in Christ, who was shadowed by this Sacrifice, therefore is honey
forbidden to be used in it, as you read here in your Chapter as well as Leaven,
verse. 11. First, in Christ there is no such sweetness as ingendreth
bitterness, or any evil to the true Cater of him by Faith. Secondly, Christ
cannot be received or eaten too much, but the more we feed on him, the better.
Thirdly, Christ is not sweet at the beginning, and bitter at the end; but
contrariwise, bitter at first, and sweet at the end. He that forsakes not
all, and follows me, cannot be my Disciple: How bitter is this at the first,
but in the end how sweet? You shall sit upon twelve Seats, and judge the
twelve Tribes of Israel: You shall eat of my Table, etc. Lastly, Christ
puffs no man up, as Leaven does the Dough, neither sowreth his servant in
whom he dwells; but he makes him lowly and humble, and sweet in behavior
to his brethren poor and grieved, and needing comfort. Melancton (not
unprofitably) says, Honey was forbidden also to be offered to God, to teach
that 1. Cor. 2.
the Word and Doctrine of God, is not to be turned to popular applause, not to
content the Prince, and to please the people, contrary to the Truth and edge of
it: Art may not draw his Divine precepts, to make them delight humane Reason;
but his Word must be left to his right Nature, please it, or displease it the
Hearers. For such Hony-offerers are but dawbers, and sowers of pillowes under
men's elbowes, flatterers, and time-seruers, hateful to God, and hurtful to
his people. Others have noted, that if honey be burned, it smells not well:
and therefore was forbidden to be used in the Sacrifice shadowing Christ's
death, as this Sacrifice by fire did: because his death smells most sweetly,
and right dear unto God also is the death of his Saints for him. The
Gentiles, again used to offer honey in their Cakes, to their Gods, as we read:
and therefore (happily) God also forbad it.

The third Rule you have in the 13. verse: All the The 3. Rule. Verse. 13.
Meat Offering shall thou season with salt, neither shall thou suffer the salt
of the Covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering, but upon all
thy Oblations, thou shall offer salt. First, it is called, the salt of the
Covenant of God, because God required it in all these Sacrifices as a Covenant,
and thing agreed upon firm and stable, not to be broken, which kind of
Covenants were called Covenants of salt. Number. 18. 19. 2 Chro. 13. 5. Secondly,
the Commandment is general. All the Meat Offerings, whereupon our Savior
Christ takes occasion to exhort, that all men would address themselves unto
the perpetual and faul^les keeping of Gods holy Covenant, by the example of
these Offerings, which (without salt) were no way acceptable nor tolerable. To
the continual keeping I say, because the Text says. Thou shall not suffer the
salt of the Covenant Chap. 2. 13.
of thy God to be lacking from thy Meat Offering. which is, as if he had said,
ever have in thy self the Word and Law of thy God, with which thou art
seasoned as with salt, the Offerings of strangers from Gods Covenant being
never acceptable, but an abomination to God. For the true seasoning, which
finds grace Translata locutio a sensibus ad animum. Tremel.
with God, is no where found but in the Word, and therefore all worships
devised by man (seem they never so witty, and gay in the eyes of the
Inuenters (are unsavory and odious. Others looking at Christ his alluding to
this place in the 9. of Mark abouesaid, gathered thus of it: that Christ from
this Ceremony draws his exhortation to his faithful, that they patiently
endure to be purged and purified, if they desire ever to be acceptable to God.
For every Sacrifice says he, must be salted with salt, and every man shall be
salted Mar. 9. 49.
with fire: that is, our corrupt affections, by the Word and the Cross, as by
a holy fire, cleansed and cleared from that displeasing savor they yield, and
we wholly seasoned unto God, as this mortality will give us leave. If you
think farther of salt thus preferred before Leaven and honey, you shall see
that salt is most commodious for man's use. For salt keeps our meat from
putrefaction, it keeps wine from sowring, it preserves dead bodies a long
time sweet and sauourie, it yields our meat a good taste, and dries up the
superfluous moisture of it in our bodies, which might breed diseases: and (in a
word) so good it is, that the Proverb joins it with the Sun, without which
we cannot live, saying: Sale and Sole nihil viilius: Than Salt and the Sun
nothing is more profitable. Witty and sharp Sales.
pleasant speeches have their name of salt, and he that has no wit, is said
to have no salt in him. Salt then was Non habet salom.
required in the Sacrifice to figure out Christ, who indeed is the true salt,
that seasoneth us and all our works, or else neither we nor they please God.
Sin has made us unsavory to God; and, till this salt be sprinkled over us,
we have no access to him, nor favor with him, but when once we are seasoned
with Christ, Then he that touches you, touches the apple of mine Eye. And as
our persons, so our works then please him, before being foul, and as a
stained cloth. So that now it is said, He that believes in me shall not
perish, but have eternal life. To Christ we are begotten by the Ministry of
the Word, and therefore the Apostles were called salt, and the Ministers of
GOD, still are the salt of the earth. For as salt lights upon the flesh, and
byteth and dries up corrupt moystore, pre^eruing and keeping sweet the same:
even so the Ministers by their labors consume and dry up the errors, the
lusts, the pride, the vainglory, the covetous affections and whatsoever
makes unsavory, preserving body and soul sweet unto God in Christ, and
free from eternal corruption.

If thou offer a Meat Offering of thy first fruits unto the Verse. 14.
Lord, thou shall offer ears of Corn dried by the fire, and wheat beaten out
of the green ears, etc. It was said in the beginning, that these
Meat Offerings were here laid down in three kinds: The first, raw flesh; the
second, flower not raw, but either baked, fried, or sodden; the third, Corn
not ground to flower. The two first kinds you have seen with their
Ceremonies; and now follows this third kind. You may here remember the many
sorts of Offerings of first-Fruites mentioned in the Scriptures, whereof this
is but one. In Deutro. you read of first-Fruites, but in a basket, and carried
to Deuteronomy. 26. 2.
the place appointed, In Leuiticus here you read of a Leuit. 23. 10.
sheafe of the first-fruites of the harvest to be brought unto the Priest. In
Exodus you read of that general Offering of first-fruites. In Deutro: again
of the offering Exodus 23. 16. Deuteronomy. 12. Leuit. 23. 17. Numb. 15. 20.
of Tenths. In the Chapter also (above noted) of this Book, you read of two
leauened loaves to be brought. And, in Numb. of cakes to be made of their
first dough. Lastly, this kind here noted of Ears of Corn dried by the fire,
etc. By this diversity we may well note, (and sincke it deep into our
hearts) what a reckoning God makes of Thankfulness in man, for the benefits
and mercies he receives at Gods hands; and how odious it is to him, and
dangerous to man, when it is otherwise. And by this sort we may still see
Christ figured, and taught: whereupon Christ compares himself to Corn, which
except it fall into the ground and dye, it abides alone; but if it die, it
brings forth much John 12. 24. (...). Cor. 15. 20.
fruit. And the Apostle calls Christ the first-fruites. The beating also of
the Corn out of the husks, shadowed the bitter Passion of our Savior.

2 The remainder (a memorial being burned to God) did remain to the Priests:
so shadowing out, that Christ should not obtain Heaven for himself, but for
his Church, which was represented in the Priest, all being a royal
Priesthood. Again, it taught how careful God would have his servants for the
maintenance of the Ministry, when they see him so careful of them, and for
them. From which care how far they are that spoil them, and all manner of
ways abus^ them, let their own souls witness unto them before the smarting
day come. And thus do you profit by this Chapter.

CHAP. III.
THE Burnt-offering and the Meat Offering thus passed over, this Chapter
returning again to the Sacrifices of living creatures, speaks of The Heads
of the Chapter.
the Peace Offering, that is, a Sacrfice of thanksgiving, offered for peace and
prosperity, either generally, or particularly. For who, says Job, has been
fierce against him, Job. 9. 4.
and has prospered? He remoueth the Mountains and they feel not when he
ouer-throweth them in his wrath. He remoueth the Earth out of her place, and
the pillars thereof do shake, etc. That men therefore might know their peace
and safety both of their persons and goods, to proceed only from this
Almighty GOD, therefore would he have a set kind of Sacrifice to be offered
of them for the same, and called a Peace Offering. This kind of Sacrifice has
something like, and something unlike to the Burnt-offering, described in the
first Chapter. Like were these, It was brought to the door of the Tabernacle
as that was: the Offerers hand laid upon the head, killed, and the blood
sprinkled about the Altar, as there etc. Unlike were these: In that, only a
Male might be offered: in this, either Male, or female: in that, the whole was
burnt; in this, only a part: namely, the fat, and as you see verse. 4. etc, in
that, no part went to any man but the skin, this was divided into 3. parts,
one to the Lord, one to the Priest, and one to the Offerer, as you see in the
7. Chapter of this Book, and Deuteronomy. 18. in that, fowls might be offered; in
this, not, etc. Of the former nothing needs to be said again, because in the
first Chapter they were sufficiently opened, but of the latter a little.

1 First then, what might it mean, that in the Burnt-Offering, only a Male
might be offered, and in this Peace Offering, both Male and Female? Answer may
be made, that first the Lord in this would draw the Israelites from the manner
and fashion of the idolatrous Egyptians, who in their Sacrifices (as Herodotus
notes) used to offer no Female. And secondly, he would herein yield a comfort
to all women, that for them Christ should die as well as for men, and they
should be heirs of his Kingdom (by Faith in Christ) as well as men. For there
is neither Jew, nor Grecian (says the Apostle) there is neither bound nor
free, there (...). 3. 28.
is neither Male nor Female, but we are all one in Christ Jesus. And ye
husbands, says S. Peter, dwell with your wives as men of knowledge, giving
honor unto the women, as unto the weaker vessel, (Now mark) even as they
which are heirs together of the grace of Life, that your prayers be not
interrupted. A sweet Savior then is the Lord Jesus, you see, to women as well
as to men, if they have grace to believe; and in token here of GOD would have
the Female offered, as well as the Male. It was a blessed Woman that said, My
spirit rejoices in God my Savior: And so may every true-beleeuing woman say
with comfort.

2 In the Offering of the fat that covers the Inwards and all the far that is
upon the Inwards etc. verse. 3. 4. Some have judged the delights and pleasures
of the flesh to be shadowed, which of a true child of God are to be killed and
slain as Sacrifices were, and mortified. Others, looking at the phrase of the
Scripture, which usually notes by the word (fat) the best things, have
thought, that herein was figured and taught, how men ought to offer to God ever
of their best, and not, as we now a days do, of our worst. For the phrase,
you have it often in Scripture, as when God says. All the fat of the Oil, and
all the fat of the wine have I given thee: that is, the chiefest, or the best.
Numb. 18. In the Numb. 18. 12 Psalm. 81. 16.
Psalm, God would have fed them with the fat of the Wheat; your vulgar
Translation expresses what that is, even with the finest Wheat Flour. In
another Psalm. 63. 6.
Psalm, My soul shall be satified as it were with marow and fatness. That
is, even (as it were) with the best things, and so in many places more. For the
matter, who in right should have the best, if God should not? of whom we have
the best, and all whatsoever we have. Think then of this many ways by your
self, andaamend what is amiss. In your Tithes and Duties do you give the
best? Do you offer the fat? No, no, your conscience accuses you fearfully (I
fear) in this behalf. He that swears and swaggereth all his youth, and
intends to offer unto God his old age, when for debilitie of body he can do
no more harm, does he offer to GOD the fat, or the lean? the best, or the
worst? He that has many sons, and can endure none to serve God in his Temple
but only one that is lame and full of imperfections, does he offer willingly
the fat unto his God, Who gave him all these branches of his body, and must
give him comfort of them, or else he shall never have any, but unspeakable woe
and grief in steed of it? Thus may you go further in this Meditation, and be
the better by it in many particulars. Again, because this fat appointed to be
offered was an inward thing, and not an outward. Others have thought, that
thereby was figured, how careful we must ever be to offer unto God our
inwards, without which no eternal duty can or will please God. Hypocrites are
full of out-ward holiness, make clean diligently the outside of the platter:
but God abhors them and their painted shows. The true worshippers of God
take an other course, and look that all be well within. The Lord (says David)
loves truth in the inward parts, and his Sacrifice is a troubled spirit, a
broken and a contrite heart within, not a pale face, a down look, many
out-ward sighs that are heard of men, vain fasting from flesh, and surfeting
upon Fish, etc. Enter into thy Chamber and shut the door to thee, and thy
Father which sees in secret shall reward thee openly. Still, still, offer to
God thy in-wards. Moses prayed within, Anna prayed within, Exodus 14. 15. 1.
Sam. 1. 13.
that her cheek quiuered with the vehemency of her spirit, etc.

3 (In that, part of the Sacrifice went also to the party that offered it)
plainly was figured, that Christ should die for all, and Laymen (as we
speak) should have their portion in him, as well as the Clergy; the Hearers as
well as the Preacher; the people as well as the Minister be blessed in him, if
God vouchsafe Faith. So men, so women, so learned and unlearned, and All take
hold, and hold fast; He is All-sufficient for us all, to bring us to the
Kingdom of his Father, without vain supplies of sinful Idolaters, and he
belongs to us all, if we be not in fault our selves. This I say again, might
be learned by the allowance of part of the Sacrifice to them that offered it,
of what degree and calling soever they were.

4 You may here observe how they were forbidden Verse. 17.
to eat either fat, or blood. The Lords prohibition of fat, might teach them
to like and use a modest, moderate, and fiting diet, which as it is good for
the body, so also has it profit for the soul. He that loves Wine Prou. 21.
17.
and Oil, (says the Wiseman) shall not be rich. And, Beware of surfeting
and drunkenness, of excess and belly chere often says the Scripture,
inregard of the soul. Fasting and prayer are joined together, not feasting and
prayer. A ship too much laden ^^nketh; and, a body too much stuffed with
fulness of bread perishes. It is a Bi^ vincit, q(...) se vincit. Bis
interimitur, qui suis armis perit. Vino formaperit, vino corrumpitur aetas.
Vino s^pe suum nescit amica virum. Propert.
double conquest to conquerthy self: And It is a double destruction to destroy
thy self, John's meat was Locusts and wild honey, a moderate diet. The
companion of Gluttony is rottenness, and the follower of drunkenness is
forgetfulness and sottishness. Gods people are here forbidden to eat their
fat, and think ever on the meaning. Blood also was forbidden to them, that so
they might learn to take heed of cruelty, and to taste of mercy and loving
kindness, in all their actions and behavior. God is merciful, and we must
follow him. Satan and his members are bloody and cruel, we must avoid it.
Mercy and Cruelty are two large matters, you may your self (as you like)
follow the Meditation Leuit. 17. 10.
far. Whosoever (says the Lord) he be of the house of Israel, or of the
strangers that soiourne among them, that eats any blood, I will even set my
face against that person that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his
people, etc.

Thus had this people their Peace Offerings, that is, duties of Thankfulness
to their God, for their peace and prosperity vouchsafed unto them. And most
fit it was, that he should often be thanked for such favors. The like mercies
and goodness remain to us at this day; and are we either freed from the
duty, or left without means to perform it? No, no; but as they had Oxen and
Kine, and Sheep and Goats then appointed and allowed; so have we the Calves
of our lips, and the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving still remaining for us, and as
strictly required of us, as these (in those days) were of them. Offer them up
then with a free heart, and with a feeling soul. Our Peace is great, our
prospeperitie comfortable, our GOD most swee and kind, and shall we not offer?
The public is sweet, the private is sweet, and forget you to offer? We lay us
down and take our rest, and this our God makes us dwell in safety, O where
is your Offering? We rise again and go to our labor, and a Dog is not
heard to move his tongue among us: Owe we no Offering? O Lord, O Lord, make us
thankful to Thee for these mercies; The whole state we live in, for the
common, and our several souls, for several mercies now many years inioyed.
O touch us, O turn us from our fearful dullness, and abusing of this so
sweet, so long, and so happy Peace. Continue thy sacred Servant, the chiefest
means under Thee of this our comfort, and ever still furnish him with wise
helps, truly fearing Thee, and truly loving him. Let our heads go to the
grave in this peace, if it may be thy blessed pleasure, and our eyes never see
the change of so happy an Estate. Make us thankful and full of
Peace Offerings, be Thou still ours, and ever merciful,

Amen, Amen.
CHAP. IIII.
MOses having spoken of such Sacrifices and Oblations, as were Exercises of
piety and gratitude to God; now begins to add such as were Expiatorie, and
did reconcile men unto God, abolishing their guiltiness and sin: yet, not by
the virtue of the thing, but by Faith in Christ promised and shadowed by the
Sacrifice, Heb. 10. In this Chapter he speaks of the Sinne-offering, that The
Heads of the Chapter. Galat. 6. 1.
is, of a kind of Sacrifice ordained to be offered for sins committed of
error, such as S. Paul notes, when he faith, Brethren, if any man be suddenly
taken in any offense, Ye which are spiritual, restore such a one with the
spirit of meekness, considering thy self, lest thou be also tempted. For
there be other sins of error, which are not here meant, which David's
distinction of sins in his Psalm may teach you: whereby he makes a
difference betwixt his Secret sins, (O Lord, cleanse me from my Psalm. 19. 12.
13.
seciet faults) and presumtuous sins, (O Lord, keep thy Servant from
presumtuous sins, lest they get the dominion over me.) The sins therefore
of error, here meant, are such, as have in them no wicked pride against God,
but of mere weakness are committed, whilst the infirmity of the flesh
choaketh reason and judgment, that the offender is for the time blind, and
sees not his fault. The Kites and Ceremonies of this Sacrifice differs
according to the quality of the person for whom it was. The manner was diverse,
the matter was diverse. If it were the High Priest, then thus; If the Prince,
then so; If a priuate-man, then after Aliter.
another fashion; as your Chapter shows. The matter also was one, If rich men
offered; an other, If Aliud.
poor men; and a third sort, if men of the middle-sort; that is, neither rich
nor poor, but well offered. Wherein, that still still the Lord pleased to
respect the poor, and to fit his Sacrfice to their ability, what a comfort
contains it, if it be well marked? Shall any worldly want break thy heart,
when to thy GOD thou art so dear even in that want, and with that want? No,
no, be of good comfort, and let this world be as God pleases, the next world
is thine, where is true and during-comfort. This was felt of David as sweet,
when he prefers the light of Gods countenance upon him, before wine and
Psalm. 4. 6, 7.
oil and worldly wealth whatsoever. And yet (even here) the Lord will never
leave you without his merry, as shall be fit, whose providence feeds the
young Ravens.

2 Consider the end of this kind of Sacrifice. It was not instituted to
abrogate Civil punishments which according to the Law were to be inflicted
upon offenders, as Thieves, Murderers, and so forth: but it was ordained (as
has been said) for the expiation of those faults which ignorantly (as not
thinking of the Per incogitantiam.
matter) were committed against the Ceremonial Law chiefly, and for which
there was no other punishment laid down either Civil or Criminal. Neither
was this expiation other, you must ever remember, than as Faith truly took
hold of Christ figured by the Sacrifice. For, it stands firm, that it is
impossible for the blood of Bulls and Goats to take away sins: Heb. 10. 4.
But Christ with his own Offering has consecrated for ever them that are
sanctified: verse. 14. See also Romans 8. 3. 2. Cor. 5. 21. Heb. 13. 11. etc.

3 The first person that is named is the Priest, that is, Verse 3.
the High Priest, that is anointed, who, says your Chapter, If he do sin
(according to the sin of the people) then shall he offer for his sin which
he has sinned, a young Bullock without blemish (for a sinne-offering) unto
the Lord, etc. By which you may profit thus; When you read that the
High Priest had need also some times to offer for his negligences and
ignorances, you see how plainly it was taught to that people, that the
High Priest, was not the true High Priest which should make perfect and sound
satisfaction and atonement to God, but another was to be expected, of whom
that was but a Figure and shadow, to wit, the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of
GOD, promised in the Scriptures. Then for the Ceremonies used: The bringing of
him to the Verse 4.
door of the Tabernacle, The laying his hand on his head, The killing of him,
etc, have been expounded before. But where mention is made of The blood
brought Verse. 5.
into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, you may remember, that there were two
sorts of these Offerings for sin. One, whereof the blood was thus brought in,
and of these the Priest might eat no part, but the flesh, the Skin, the
head, etc, were burned without the Host, Heb. 13. 11. Leuit 6. ^0. and 16. ^7.
Verse. 6.
verse. 11. An other, whereof the blood was not brought in, and the flesh of
such the Priest might eat, Chap. 6. of this Book and 10. The sprinkling of
the blood seven times, signified that the satisfaction and expiation for, and
of sin made once by Christ, endured good for ever in all ages and times, and
needed not to be iterated; The number of seven representing the whole time of
this worlds continuance. Others, by this seuen-foldsprinckling, have thought,
that the grieuousnes of sin was shadowed and noted. For (say they) it is
written, He that slays Cain shall be punished seuen-fold; that is, Genesis 4.
15. 24.
grievously. And again, If Cain be avenged seuen-fold, truly Lamech
seuentie-times seuen-fold: that is, more grievously a great deal. Wherefore,
this seuen-times sprinkling of the blood, might note, that every sin (with
God) deserves seven punishments, that is, sharp and great punishment, if he
should deal with us in Justice, and not in mercy.

4 The blood was put upon the horns of the Altar of Verse 7. etc.
sweet incense, to signify, that no prayer can perce unto God, but in and by
the blood of Christ. All the rest of the blood was powered at the foot of the
Altar of burnt Offering, to note still the true shedding of CHRIST'S blood for
mankind, and because also it was holy, it might not be cast out as profane.
The burning of the body without the host, plainly showed that Christ should
not suffer in Jerusalem, but should be led out of the City to a place
appointed, and there suffer: which you know was fulfilled accordingly. Heb. 13.
11. 12. And, the whole Bullock was to be burned, being a sin offering, to
teach men to burn all their sins, and not to divide them (as we do) when we
say, I will amend my drunkenness, but I cannot leave my swearing; or, if I leave
that also, yet my licencious life a little more must have a swinge, etc. But
burn all, thou were best, and willingly keep none, burn them (I say) by true
sorrow and detestation of them, even All, All, lest but one (being wilfully
still delighted in) burn thee all and wholly in Hell for ever. When Moses with
the Israelites was to depart out of Egypt, and Pharaoh would have had them
leave their cattle behind them, saving what they intended to sacrifice:
Answer was made, they would not leave one hoof of Exodus 10. 26.
a beast behind: and so deal you with your sins, leave not one hoof of
sin behind, No one sin, no part of sin, that is (still I say) by
wittingly, willingly, and boldly continuing in it, and delighting in it:
Otherwise, free from sin in this life we cannot be. But (through the grace of
GOD) we may be free from presumtuous pleasure in sin, and sigh and groan more
and more, for that any way we should offend so good a God, as we find infinite
ways of him that we do offend, desiring and longing to be free even from all
sin.

5 In that there is more solemnity about the Sinne-offering of the Priest,
than of a priuate-man; you may first see the care of God, to set out to his
Church the Dignity of his Calling, which ever with him was great, and for him,
with all that truly reverenced and feared his name. Secondly, you may think
of the greatness of sin in such a One. For, the more is required to the
expiation of it, the greater is ever the sin. The like may be said of Princes
faults, and great men's. Also, by the heavy punishment which God Verse 22. 1.
Sam. 4. ^8. 1. Sam. 2. 22. 23 24. 1. Sam. 15. 9. 23. 2. Sam. 12. 11. Wisd 6. 5.
has laid on them, when they fell, the same appears, for how heavily did God
punish Eli the Priest, for not correcting his sons faults, but by a sinful
kind of gentleness, suffering their grieouous misdemeanors to continue? King
Saul for sacrificing against the Law, how sharply punished? David's adultery
and murder, O how fearfully punished? Horribly and suddenly will God appear
to the great Officers of his kingdom. And The mighty shall be mightily
tormented, says the Book 6.
of Wisdom. Read your self the 6. Chapter of the Book.

6 In the 13. verse Note, how a multitude of offenders excuses no offense:
but, if even the whole Congregation Verse 13.
should sin through ignorance, yet a sinne-offering must be offered by them
all, and their number yields no excuse. Great was the number of sinners, when
God sent the Flood, but their number defended them Gen 6.
not. So in Sodom and Gomorrha the offenders were Gen, 19.
many. Ten Tribes of twelve fell away from GOD and became Idolaters. Broad is
the way that leads to Hell, and many find it, going to Hell, though they be
many, etc. Secondly, observe with your self the phrase (hid from your eyes)
and see the state of many a man and woman doing evil. The matter is hid from
their eyes in Gods anger, and albeit they lie at the pits brinke of damnation
and destruction, yet they see it not, feel it not, are not troubled with it.
Because (indeed) they never sit and take an account of themselves and their
works, laying them to the Rule of the Word: which if they did, conscience
would quickly bite and spy, and speak of a misdoing. The Godly do this at
last, and therefore you see here in your Chapter, a time of knowing to them,
as there was a time of hiding. Pray we ever for this grace, that we sleep not
in death: I mean in sin that leads to death, but that we may awake Ephesians.
5. 14.
and stand up from the dead, and lesus Christ vouchsafe us Light to amendment
of life, and eternal comfort and saftie.

7 In the 22. verse. you see the like Offering for the Verse ^^.
Ruler when he should sin, that is, for the Heads and Chief men of the
Tribes, who had authority among them. No man is exempted, Priest, nor Prince,
but all that sin must use the means appointed to remove their sins, or
else all must taste the punnishment for their contempt. For he that is Lord
over all (says the Wisd 6. 8.
Book of Wisdom) will spare no person, neither shall he fear any
greatness: for he has made the small and the great, and cares for all alike.
Yea, the mighty abides 9.
the sorer trial.

8 In the 27. verse, you have the Sinne-offering for private persons; which, by
this already spoken, is plain enough, and you may confer it with the 15. of
Numb. verse. 22. And let this suffice of this Chapter.

CHAP. V.
BEfore Moses will proceed to show what poor people should offer for their
sin, in this Chapter he lays down certain kinds of sin for which they
must offer, and by which The Heads of the Chapter.
they may learn to judge of other the like offenses. And, the first is an
Example of the Judicial Law, in the first verse. The plain meaning whereof
Verse. 1.
is, if any shall hear one swear that either he has not had, or has not
done, what he (upon his own knowledge) understands he has had, and has
done, if he testify not what he knows, and reveal not the iniquity of the
other that has so falsely sworn, he shall be guilty of his sin. Where you
see and ought ever to remember, that not only he takes the Name of God in
vain, which swears falsely; but even he also that winketh at the same false
oath, being able to reprove him, and zealously does not his endeavor to have
that abuse of Gods Name punished by revealing and making it known. A Law that
touches us nearly, as the world goes now, men wholly preferring many Vsitatum
humani generis vitium est, peccatum latendo committere, negando defendere, and
defendendo multiplicare. Greg.
times their affection to their friends before all the glory of God in this
behalf.

2 The second example is of the Law Ceremonial in the 2. verse. As if he should
have said, whenever any person becomes unclean by touching of such things
as make him unclean, and carelessly neglecting (according to Rites of the Law)
to purge himself from that uncleanness, eat of the sanctified Sacrifices,
as soon as that his sin shall be known unto him, he must offer the Offering
here prescribed etc. The true drift of which Law was to draw men to the
careful and diligent consideration of their impuritie, and to the knowledge of
their sin. Read over the first of Esaias, and see how the Lord abhors all
Sacrifices and services whatso-euer, when men see not their sin, but run on
with their offenses, and yet think to please God with out-ward Religion. No,
no, says God there, that will not be. But wash you, make you clean, take away
the evil of your works from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to
do well, seek judgment, releive the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and
defend the widow, and then the case shall be altered, etc. Then, though your
sins were as Crimsin, they shall be made as white as snow, and though they
were red as Skarlet, they shall be as wool. If you consent and obey, ye shall
eat the good things of the land: but, if ye refuse and be rebellious, ye shall
be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of the the Lord has spoken it. Thus
seeks the Lord to have us know sin, and fly sin. And mark it again in
the Text, verse. 2. (And is not ware of it) making to your self this good use
of it: That we are not ever clean, when we see not any uncleanness; for our
fault may be hid from us, and we not ware of it, and therefore David prays
for his secret sins. But still it remains an uncleanness, though we be
blind, and it will bestroy us, if we see it not in time. Wherefore pray for
eyes and the Lord shall give them; pray for a heart of flesh, and the Lord
shall give it. If thou see thy sin, Si tu peccata videris, Dominus
obliuiscetur; si tu neglexe^ is ea videre, Dominus memor erit eorum.
God shall not see it, and if thou see not, God will remember it. Upon our
Garments we endure not uncleanness an hour, not a mote, not a little mote, but
we brush, and beat, if we be not brushed; yea, the very shoo upon our foot is
regarded that it be clean, and every day we look unto it often: yet see (and
tremble to think on it) our bodies and souls are unclean, and we see it not,
no, we go not about to see it, but use all the means we can to be far from
the sight of it, as sports, plays, company, and such like. We hate him that
will rub us that way, and we avoid the place where sin is reproved, It
breeds melancholy, and marreth mirth, We cannot abide it at any hand. But
remember you this your Chapter, and follow the Law of the Lord, if you will be
safe.

3 The third Example is of the moral Law, in the 4. verse, concerning rash
Oaths and vows: where, I pray you, carefully mark, That albeit rashness and
inconsiderate haste, with man has some excuse, before set and purposed
actions; yet (with God) it is evil, and there must be an Expiatorie sacrifice
offered for it. Let it reform our rash swearing in our common talk, and our
foolish vowing of things neither lawful, nor in our power. And think with
your self, whether they err not greatly, that think what they have rashly
sworn and vowed they must needs keep, when you see here, God would have
them offer a sinne-offering for their rashness; and not add more sin unto
it, by performing what they have sinfully said. Also by this occasion consider,
how defiled creatures we are before our God, when even that is sin in us,
wherein we have not a mind to sin, as in such rash things we often have not.

4 But if he be not able to bring a Sheep, he shall Verse. 7 and 11.
bring for his trespass which he has committed, two Turtle-Doues, or two
young Pigeons unto the Lord, one for a Sinne-offering, and the other for a
Burnt-offering. Now see the sweet goodness of the Lord to his poor People,
that are not able to bring such Offerings to him as others do, and so by the
subtlety of Satan, and frailty of Faith might be drawn to think that God
regarded them as men do, that is, either little, or not at all. To these he
appoints small Offerings, framing his Law to their powers, and so giving
them most sweet and true comfort of his love to them, as also in accepting of
their little as well as of the greater Sacrifices of richer persons. It has
been touched before, but it can never be learned too much, so weak are we,
and subject to doubts.

5 Note again in the 11. Verse, how no Oil might The Ceremony of Oil, and
Incense.
be put upon that Offering, neither any incense. Oil signifying gladness,
and Incense a sweet savor. The Lord by this Ceremony shadowed how hateful a
thing sin is, and all that commit it, till the Lord be reconciled to them
again. He has no joy in us, neither yield we any sweet savor. And as he
ioyeth not in us, so should we not joy in our selves. For if we do, we power
Oil upon our Sacrifice, contrary to the Law: and if we think well of our
selves we put incense also unto it. The Lord loves a sorrowing sinner adorned
with sackcloth and ashes, and they that so weep, shall laugh: he abhors
proud sinners, that do evil, and yet rejoice, assuring such laughers that
they shall weep. But alas our days! who sorrow less than they that sin
most? and who are more lusty and iolye, than they that have least cause, (if
they knew their estate?) Read the 21 of Job, and see the merry days of the
wicked, so in the Book of Wisdom again, and in many more places in the
Scripture. These men offer prayers to God at times, after their fashion; but
they put Oil and Incense upon their Offering, they rejoice, and are merry
being full of evil, and they think their smell is as Incense to God, pleasing
and acceptable, when he abhors them, and all their works. O, take heed
therefore of this vufeelingnesse, and remember this Ceremony often in all your
doings, and you disliking your self, the Lord shall like you in his liked and
beloved Son, your only Savior ever.

6 In the 15. verse See and mark the Law against purloyning and taking away of
Tithes or First-fruites due to the Priests. God still loves his Ministers, and
still requires, that they be honestly and liberally maintained; God still
abhors the wilful and wayward breakrs of such Order for their maintenance,
as the Christian Magistrate in his authority (according to right) establishes
and appoints. Therefore let such as desire to be acceptable to God, neither
offend him, nor their own consciences by such fraud, and injury. S. Augustines
Speech is as true, as old, The fault is not forgiven with Non dimittitur
peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum. Aug: Epist. 54. contra Maced. Si res aliena
propter quam peccatum est reddi possit, and non redditur, poenitentia no^
agitur, sed fingitur. Idem.
God, unless that which was taken away be restored to men; not, that
restitution takes away sin before God, but because true Faith must needs
have good fruit, and cannot be without restitution, if there be power, and if
not, yet in heart and will. For again, Saint Augustine, If that which is
another man's, sinfully purloyned by me, be not restored, repentance is but
feigned, there is none indeed. How little this false and unjust dealing with
Gods Ministers is regarded with many in these days, who knows not? and they
are never troubled for it, much less do they purpose either restitution, or
amendment. But the day will come, when it will smart, this Law of God having
his enduring equity, and God in other places professing, That this robbing of
his servants is the robbing of him; Malach. 3. 8. Leuit. 22. 14.
and so he takes it, and so will punish it. But let this suffice of this
Chapter. These things will come in other places to be remembered again.

CHAP. VI.
THis Chapter first speaks of the The Heads of the Chapter.
Offering for Sins that are done willingly. And secondly, sets out more
fully the Rites and Ceremonies of other Sacrifices, briefly touched before,
beginning with the fire and ashes of the Burnt-offering. Of the former the Text
says thus. If any sin and commit a trespass against the Verse 2.
Lord, and deny to his neighbor that which was taken him to keep, or that
which was put to him of trust, or does by robbery, or violence oppress his
Neighbor, Or verse 3.
has found that which was lost, and denies it, and swears falsely, for any
of these things, that a man does, wherein he sins: when I say, he thus
sins and trespasseth, Verse 4.
he shall then restore the robbery that he robbed, or the thing taken by
violence which he took by force, or the thing which was delivered to him to
keep, or the lost thing which he found, Or, for whom soever he has Verse 5.
sworn falsely, he shall both restore it in the whole sum, and shall add the
fifth part more thereunto and give unto him to whom it pertains, the same day
that he offers for his trespass. Also he shall bring for his trespass unto
Verse 6.
the Lord, a Ram without blemish out of the flock in thy estimation worth
two sickles for a trespass Offering unto the Priest. And the Priest shall make
an atonement Verse. 7.
for him before the Lord, and it shall be forgiven him, whatsoever thing he
has done, and trespassed therein. This Place thus written out at large,
yields great comfort to many a trembling soul, and therefore duly to be
regarded. Sins of ignorance have not such blackness in them (although
Sins, as you saw before,) as sins wittingly and willingly committed: and
therefore, when feeling comes, this Circumstance of knowledge greatly
afflicts the conscience. But blessed be God, even these sins also find
mercy with him upon true Repentance. So did Abraham for his lie, (which
contrary to his knowledge) he wittingly and willingly committed. So did David
for his fall, Peter, and many more. Here you see a Special sacrifice
appointed, and an atonement to be made. Should it not be so likewise now, that
even for these sins there were an atonement by Jesus Christ, our state under
the Gospel were worse than theirs under the Law. Yet let no mercy and
goodness in God make us bold and presumptuous to sin, but with David pray
against such kind of sinning ever. Keep me O, Lord, from presumptuous sins,
that they have not dominion over me, etc.

2 You may observe the examples or particulars laid down in the Text, and see
how before God all these are sins which yet many persons in the world make
little reckoning of, To deny the thing committed to our keeping, To break the
trust reposed in us, To rob our Neighbors and violently to take things from
them, To deny that which was lost and we have found, To swear falsely many
times, and even for trifles, with such like, do every one think them sins,
and stand in fear to commit them? No, we know it well, they are lightly
thought of by too many. But let Gods Law profit all his to a true knowledge
what is sin, and to a due care to avoid it, when we know it. So shall it he
well with us for ever, and with those also we wish well unto after us, to a
thousand generations.

3 Note in the 5. verse. The restitution again which God appoints to be made
to the owners, even with a fifth part more, the same day that he offers for
his trespass. And still gather this Doctrine for your use, When we will agree
with God, we must also agree with (...) neighbor.
That GOD is never pleased with any thing that is ours, whilst we retain and
keep that which is not ours. But mark well an Offering to the Lord, beside
that satisfaction of men. And through all Moses, find me a place where sin
is taken away otherwise than by Sacrifice. Now, whatsoever is attributed to the
Sacrifices, the same is plainly taken away from man's works. And if it was
never the meaning of God to tie that people to the out-ward Sacrifice it self,
but by the same to lead them to Christ shadowed by the Sacrifice, then
apparent it is to all men, that there is no means to take away sin, but
only by Christ: Which all men will not confess, because they would establish
works in farther strength tha^ God has given.

4 Well, weigh it again, in the 7. verse and ever Verse. 7.
throughout these Books, That the Priest must make the a^onement; so ever
signifying, that not in the Sacrifice, but in the Priesthood was the matter.
Now, that Priesthood noted Christ his Office. And therefore, as then no
Sacrifice pleased, but offered by the Priest, so at this day nothing of ours,
as prayer, and such like avails, but in Christ, and by Christ our only and
eternal High Priest. Again, the Text says, before the Lord this atonement
shall be, thereby overthrowing the wicked error of them, that affirmed a civil
purgation only of sin by those Sacrifices, and not any spiritual promise in
them. Which, I say, is most wicked, as well as false. Because so, those
Sacrifices and Exercises of piety, should no way have served, to breed and
strengthen Faith, in man touching his spiritual estate, whereunto in deed
they wholly aimed, and effectually wrought in the godly that used them rightly.

5 The second point in this Chapter is, concerning the Rites and Ceremonies of
the Sacrifices; And first of the firevpon the Altar, wherewith the
Burnt-offering was consumed. The Text is thus. Then the Lord spoke unto Moses
saying, Command Aaron and his sons saying, This is the Law of the
Burnt-offering, (it is the Burnt-offering, verse 9. The Ceremony of fire.
because it burns upon the Altar all the night unto the morning, and the fire
burns on the Altar, etc.) So careful is God of this continual burning, that
(if you mark) it is repeated over and over. In the 12. verse again, but the
fire upon the Altar shall burn there verse 12. 13.
and never be put out. Again in the 13. verse, The fire shall ever burn upon
the Altar, and never go out, etc. To this end, the Priests care was to feed
it with wood, and see to it, day and night, and with no other fire might either
Sacrifice, or Incense, be burned and offered to God. This fire was carefully
kept upon the Altar to the captivity of Babylon, and afterward found again of
Nehemias, 2. Mach^b. 1. 18. and 19 verses. Of like from hence might grow that
great honor and regard, which the Heathens had fire in, whereof we read often.
The The Greek word (...), and the latin Vesta, are thought to come originally
of the Hebrew Esch Iah, the fire of God. Xeno: (...). l. 8. Plutarch: in vita
Artax^^xis and Alexandri. etc.
Athenians in their Prytaneo, and at Delphos, and at Rome of those Vestall
Virgins continual fire was kept, and of many it was worshipped as a GOD. The
Persians called it Orismada, that is, Holy-fire, and in public pomp they
used to carry it before Kings, with great solemnity. A merry Tale there is of
this god (Fire) which I will repeat. The Chaldeans, say our Books,
worshipping this vain god, proudly boasted that of all other gods he was the
strongest, conquering and consuming all other gods of the Gentiles. And no
marvel, for they were either wood or metal that by fire might be defaced.
This brag at last came to the ears of a Priest of Canopus. This Canopus was
Master of Menelaus ships, and dying in an Jland, at the entry of Nilus, the
famous River of Egypt, caused that Island to be called after his name, and was
there honored for a God. This Priest fearing lest his god Canopus (the Image
being belike of some metal) might come in contempt, and so his living be
taken away, devised thus with himself. He got a water-pot full of holes,
(like unto these that we water gardens withal) stopped up all the holes with
wax, filled it full of water, painted it very trim, and setting it very
artificially upon the top of the old Image of his god Canopus, brought him
forth to contend with the Chaldeans god of fire, which of them should be the
greater. The fire was set about him, and great expectation in the beholders,
which way the victory would go. By and by, when the heat of the fire had
melted the wax that stopped the holes of the pot, the water began to stream
out at all the holes, and quite put out the fire about it. Then there was a cry
by all Canopus friends, Victory, victory: and from that time Canopus that
Idol was counted, through this subtlety of the Priest, the strongest God of
all others. Thus blind are men, when God gives not light, and thus easily
abused when they are blind. We may marvel less at this great simplicity, if
we consider what is taught and held by these, that think themselves wise in
these days; Namely, that the water, called Holy Water, sprinkled in the grave
of a dead man, not only purges the same man from all spot of sin, but
extinguisheth also, in great part, that fell-fire, which they call
Purgatorie-fire. Thus you see men's follyes both of fire and water. But pass we
them over, and come to the Matter. What might be the reason, why God appointed
this Ceremony of continual fire upon the Altar, and Sempiterna Christi
occisi^, per sempiternum ignem. etc.
how may we profit by it? First, there was figured by it, the death of Christ
from the beginning of the world, Namely that he was the Lamb slain from the
beginning for Mankind, and by this shadow they were led to believe, That
although as yet Christ was not come in the flesh, nevertheless the fruit of
his death belonged to them, as well as to those that should live when he came,
or was come: for this fire was continual and went not out, no more did the
fruit of his Passion fail to any True-beleeuer, even from the beginning. But
they were saved by believing that he should come, as we are now, by believing
that he is come. Also this fire came from Heaven, Leuit. 9. verse. 24: and so
should Christ in the time appointed. This fire was ever in, and never went out;
and so is God ever ready to accept our Sacrifices and appointed duties, ever
ready to hear us and forgive us; but we are slow and dull, and come not to
him, as we ought. No other fire might be used but this, and so they were taught
to keep to Gods Ordinances, and to fly from all inventions of their own
heads. For ever it was true, and ever will be true, In vain do men worship me,
teaching for Doctrines men's Mat. 15. 9.
praecepts. Our own devises (seem they never so wise, so fit, so holy and
excellent) they are strange fire, not that fire that came from Heaven, Not that
fire that God will be pleased withal, or endure. This fire coming first from
Heaven and thus preserved, still preached unto them by figure, that as well did
their Sacrifices and services duly performed according to the Law please God;
as that did when first God sent his fire from Heaven to consume it, in token of
approbation, which surely was a great comfort to their consciences, and a
mighty proppe to fainting, fearing, weak Faith. This fire thus mayntayned and
kept with all care, and not suffered ever to go out, taught them, and still
may teach us, to be careful to keep in the fire of Gods holy spirit, that it
never die, nor go out within us. The fire is kept in with wood, with breath, or
blowing, and with ashes: so is Gods Spirit kept in (that holy and happy fire)
by honest life as by wood; by true sighs of unfeigned repentance, as by breath
or blowing, and by meek humility as by soft ashes. O, that we may have care
to keep it in! what should I say? This continued fire taught then, (and though
it be now gone and abrogated) may still teach us now to be careful to keep
in, amongst us, the fire of Gods Word, the true preaching of his Truth, to the
salvation of our souls. Foolish men, foolishly will imitate this Law, by
maintening of lights and Lamps, candels and tapers to burn continually, but
let us care to preserve this Lamp and Light of Gods Gospel amongst us, that
it go not out, and God shall be pleased, We and ours bettered in his blessing.
It had been a heinous sin then to suffer the fire of the Altar to go forth;
and can we think it is no sin now, by taking away the maintenance, to serve
our greedy covetousness, to put out this fire from amongst us, and all Gods
people about us? GOD make Patrons think of it, and give them conscience before
there be no more time for mercy. Fitly is the Preaching of the Gospel
shadowed by the fire upon the Altar, consuming the Burnt-offering. For the fire
has these properties, it shines and gives light, it heateth, it consumes,
it tries: so the Preaching of the Gospel. Thy Psalm. 119. 105.
Word is a Lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my 2. Pet. 1. 19.
path. S. Peter calls it a Candle in a dark place, and many Scriptures teach
the shining light of it. The Luke 24. 32.
heat in like sort, Did not our hearts burn within us, whilst he talked with
us, and opened the Scriptures? The Psalm.
fire kindled, and I spoke with my tongue says the Psalm, and as fire it
pleased the Holy Spirit to appear at Pentecost, Act. 2. 3.
to show this fruit of effect of the Word preached by their mouths, it
heateth the heart to all good life, and makes us zealous of good works. The
dross of our corruption by degrees it washes, the stubble of our fancies it
burneth-vp and consumes, so that we abhor the sins we have been pleased
with, and hate the remembrance of evil passed. Lastly, it tries Doctrine, and
seuereth Truth from error; it tries men, and discovers Hypocrites. All
worthy Motives to make us careful to preserve this fire perpetually amongst us
whilst we live, and in a holy zeal to provide for it also, when we are dead.
So shall we live being dead, Nay, so shall we assuredly never die, but with
immortal souls, and never dying tongues, praise his Name that lives forever,
and will have us with him. This is the Ceremony of the fire.

6 The next Ceremony is concerning the Ashes of the Burnt-offering wherein your
Chapter says thus, ver. 10. And the Priest shall put on his linnen-garment, and
shall put Verse. 10.
on his linen breeches upon his flesh, and take away the ashes, when the fire
has consumed the Burnt-offering upon the Altar, and he shall put them beside
the Altar, etc, to the 14. verse. First, concerning these linnen-breeches, you
see the Law for them to be made Exodus 28. 42. with the Reason of the same,
modesty and comeliness in their Ministry. Verse. 11. etc.
This putting-off their garments figured that bareing of our Savior Christ
when he suffered, from his Garments; Mat. 27. 35.
so that as the Priest here laid aside the clothes he ware, and put his
linnen-breeches about his nakedness; even so was the Lord Jesus stripped out
of all his clothes, and, only with his nakedness covered, nailed upon the
Cross for our sake. Some have said also, that this laying aside of their
garments, shadowedout that laying aside (as it were) of his Divinity, whilst
in his humanity he truly suffered upon the Cross. Not that ever there was
any real separation betwixt his Natures, (that being impossible;) but because
his Godhead did (as it were) hide it self, by not showing his Power, that the
decreed Salvation of man (by the means also decreed) might be effected. The
carrying the ashes forth without the Host, notably figured-out the suffering
and burial of Christ, without the City of Jerusalem, which was performed.
The ashes Mat. 27.
were to be put in a clean place, not profaned or abused, or carelessly cast
away; so to note, that although Christ his body should dye, and be as ashes in
the conceit of men, yet should that body revive again, and must not be
putrified, but put in a clean place, even a new Tomb, wherein never any man
lay before, etc. Mat. 27. 60.


7 In the 14. verse and so to the 19. The Ceremonies of Verse 14. etc.
the Meat Offering are more fully set down, tha^ they were before, in the
second Chapter. That the remnant should Cap. 2. 3.
be the Priests, was before said; but it was not laydedowne how Aaron and his
sons should use this remnant. Wherefore now it is further added, That they
should eat it, verse. 16. But how? It shall be eaten without Verse 16. 17. 18.
Leaven, in the holy Place, in the court of the Tabernacle. The Males only
might eat it, and not women, etc. What Leaven usually in Scripture signifies,
you have heard before, Namely, corrupt doctrine, and bad life, with either
which, the Lord would not have his Priests stained. In the holy Place only,
and not elsewhere must they eat it, to signify, that only in the Church is
the benefit of Christ to be had, and not out of the Church. The branch bears
not fruit but in the Uine, and the Uine is only in the Uine-yard. This Church
is not a building of lyme and stone, but a society of Christian people, among
whom the Gospel is truly preached, the Sacraments duly and rightly
administered, and who with one consent firmly believe, that they have remission
of sins, and life everlasting, not by the merits of man's righteousness, but
by, and for the merits and righteousness of the Lord Jesus only. To be in the
Church therefore, is not to be in the place of Lyme and stone built to meet in;
but to be one of this number, that holds and believes as all Patriarks and
Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs, and all the faithful Elect of God, ever have
done from the beginning of man, and hereafter shall do to the end of the
world, who all, as you see, by these Sacrifices were drawn to Christ, and
Christ only, or else their Sacrifice auailed them nothing, but to them was
unprofitable, and to the Lord God abominable. In this Church are no Turks, no
Jews, no Infidels, nor any that live a wicked life, with careless security
and sinful delight; or yet a holy streit life in show, but inwardly are
nothing less than they seem. Wherefore with God they have no remission of
sins, and without a change they shall also fail of eternal life. That here
the Males only might eat, let it Leuit. 22. Numb. 18.
lead you to the 18. of Numbers, which will make it moreplaine, showing you
there, what women might eat as well as the men. In some things they were barred,
to signify that God would not have women bear any public Office and charge
in the Church as the Priests did, and as among the Heathens, women did, (to say
nothing of some better known:) and again in some things they were allowed to
eat, that so it might appear they belonged also to the Covenant of God, and
the merits of Christ should save them as well as men. For in Christ there is
neither Male nor Female, bond nor free, Gal. 3. 28.
rich nor poor, Noble nor base, but a new creature, that is, Christ rejects
no sort, but of what sort soever, if they be new creatures, that is, borne a
new by the Spirit to forsake sin, and live unto him in holiness and
righteousness, they are received, they are wel-come, and he or she that thus
comes, He never casts away, etc. John 6. 37.


8 From this 19. verse to the 24. the Meat Offering of the High Priest, so
often as he should be elected, by Verse 19. etc.
the death of the former, is laid down, wherein this only I note, That every
Meat Offering of the Priest, Verse 23.
must be wholly burned, and none eaten, as was of other Meat Offerings. Therein
was shadowed the perfection of that Atonement and expiation which Christ made,
and so their error confuted, that hold and teach the death of Christ only to
have taken away original sin, and that men themselves must satisfy for
actual sins. Or, that Christ has merited but the first-grace for us, that
is, he has merited, that we haerafter by our merits may take away our own
sins and others, with such like wicked and damnable assertions. But ever
remember you, That here this Offering was wholely burned, and no part left to
man; to teach, that even so in appeasing Gods wrath, Christ's Sacrifice of it
self was most perfect, and no part left unto man in that matter. Other
Scriptures also abundantly teach so much, which now often have bin touched, and
still must, to the end of this Book. Worthy is that Place of the Apostle to
the Corinthians, where speaking of actual sins, as Adultery, Fornication,
worshipping of Idols, etc, Such 1. Cor. 6. 11.
(says he) were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but
ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
Here even actual sins, and not only original are taught to be taken away
by Christ, and by Christ only. To which agrees the like Saying to Titus, and
many more. And as for Titus. 3. 3. etc. Luke 17. 10.
our merits, the words are plain, When we have done all, We must say, we are
unprofitable servants etc.

9 Lastly, in this Chapter, you have the Ceremonies Verse. 2. 4. etc.
of the sinne-offering touched again, from the 24. verse to the end of ye
Chapter. All tending to teach this strongly, That out of the Church, ^here is
no benefit to be reaped by Christ, as before has been said. Namely, this
Ceremony, that if any of the blood dropped upon a 27.
garment, that blood might not so be carried out of the holy Place, but must
there be washed away, and not carried out. What a plain figure was this, That
Christ's blood profits none out of the Church? If it were an 28.
earthen pot that it was sodden in, it must be broken, not applied after to
profane uses, and if a brasen-pot, then scowred and washed with water, all to
teach the holiness of Christ's blood which should be shed for man, and how odious
and damnable it is, after we are washed and purged by this blood, to give our
members again to uncleanness and sin, and to fashion our selves like unto
this wicked world. Many things more does both this Chapter and others contain,
if with exact curiosity, they should be stood upon, and every particular
examined; but my purpose being only to give a taste of the use of the
Scriptures, to our edification and comfort, (when we read, and have not better
helps) this much may serve to that end, and so in every Chapter, only a
touch of things shall serve. GOD (in mercy) give it a blessing to us.

Amen.
CHAP. VII.
NOw to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Trespasse-Offering, Verse. 1.
which are here more fully described than in the 4. Chapter before. This kind
of Offering was not vulgar, but it was reckoned amongst the most Holy; and
therefore has such Rites and usage as they had. It was killed in the place
where the Burnt-offering was killed, Namely, at the North-side of the Altar; so
shadowing Verse. 2.
also that Christ should die at Jerusalem of which the Prophet says. On the
North-side is the city of the great King. The blood was sprinkled round
about on the altar, shadowing that the merits of Christs-blood should be
sprinkled by preaching throughout all Nations. The Inwards were burned to
ashes, shadowing, that all the Verse. 3. 4. 5.
honor and reputation of Christ, was by his ignominious death and Passion
brought (as it were) to ashes, that is, to no account with men that knew not
the mystery of it. All they that see me, laugh me to scorn: they Psalm. 22. 7.
8.
shoot out their lips, and shake their heads, saying: He trusted in God,
that he would deliver him: let him deliver him if he will have him, etc. My
strength is dryed-vp 15.
like a pot-sheard, and my tongue cleaves to my gummes, and thou shall bring
me into the dust of death, etc. The remnant was eaten by the Priest in token
that the benefit of Christ belongs to the Faithful. The Skin of the verse
6, 7. verse 8, 9, 10.
Burnt-offcring here, was the Priests, and all the Meat Offering that is baked
in the Oven, and that is dressed in the pan, etc. Why God should think of so
small and base a thing, as the Skin, some may ask a Reason? and see you the
Reason, and the good of it. First, it notably confirms our Faith in his
Providence, that he will never forget us, and leave us destitute of things
needful and good for us, seeing we are much better than the skin of a brute
beast, whereof yet, he has care and thought. Therefore we must not shrink in
the time of want, nor hearken to Satan that so busily lays our infirmities
and unworthiness before us, that so he may shake us off from God, and make us
believe, he will never regard so vile persons, etc. But let Faith answer,
avoid Satan. For I learn that God regards Mat. 16. 23.
the Sparrowes, and forsakes them not, though two Mat. 10. 29. 31.
of them shall be sold for a farthing yea, the beasts skin in the Law he
vouchsafed to think of and to dispose of it, to his will, and he tells us
we are better than Sparrowes, and therefore better also than the beasts-skinne,
that has no life, as the Sparrowes have. He says, O ye of little Faith, If
we doubt of it, and therefore Mat. 8. 26.
I know, he will, and does think of me, and I shall have, in his time, ever
what is convenient and profitable. Secondly, it showed that sweet and
comfortable care that the Lord then had, and still has of the Ministry, that
it should be maintained, and not defrauded of the least thing allotted to it,
which still he shows in all other particulars, urging still, that they be
given to ye Priests according to his will. Great things to move our consciences
in these days, if God be with us, to a true and just dealing with those that
serve at the Altar amongst us, and not so greedily, so wickedly, and so
vnfeelingly to rob and spoil them, as we do. If this people of the Jews had
done so, in these matters allotted to the Priests, as we do with our Tithes, and
portions given to the Church in our days: do you think, or can you think GOD
would have endured it? No, you know well he would not. And is he changed? will
he not still have us taught by the Ordinance of his Word, and still them that
serve at the Altar, to live of ye Altar? Are not these duties from us now, as
due as ever those were then? It may not, it cannot with truth be denied. How
then may we first or last, escape the wrath of God for sinning so, as if the
Jews had sinned, we confess that God would have severely punished it? If you
say, so much, and so much is enough for him, and this, and that he may spare:
Make the case so of the Israelites, and in this particular of the beasts
skin, durst any flesh have so reasoned then? Beware therefore of making your
self a judge where you are none, of robbing them, that have the title, and
enriching your self that have no right. What is allotted by the Government you
live under, is his and not yours, if he be not worthy so much, the Law helps
that by a due trial of him, and yet leaves the maintenance still to a more
worthy, not to you. Harden not your heart against God, against Law, against
right and truth; accustom not your heart to covet your neighbors due, your
hands to purloyne it by fraud, or to take it by strength, it is theft,
spiritual theft, Sacrilege, your house receives stolne-goods, and the wrath
of God may happily shake the foundation of it for such sin, and you in yours,
or you and yours be punished. Thirdly, this care of the Lord for the
beasts-skinne, to appoint it to one that should have it, well taught that
people then, and still teaches us ever, to be careful to prevent strife, and
to take away all Questions and controversies as much as we may, that every one
knowing what is his, may therein rest, and peace ensue. The more God has given
you, the more must be your pain this way, in your good health and perfect
memory.

2 Your Chapter goes on with the Peace Offering, Verse. 11. 12.
whereof he specifieth two sorts: the one of Thanksgiving, the other of a Vow.
Touching the first, you remember how greatly GOD testifies his liking of it
throughout the Scriptures. In the 50. Psalm, he seems to prefer it before
all others in some sort. For I will not reprove thee (says God) for thy
Sacrifices, or Psalm. 50. 8.
forthy Burnt-offerings, because they were not always before me. I will take no
Bullock out of thy house, nor heegoates 9. 10.
out of thy Folds. For all the beasts of the Forest are mine, and so are the
cattle upon a thousand hills etc. Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy
Vows 14. 23.
unto the Most-High. Who so offers unto me thanks and praise, he honors
me: and to him that orders his conversation aright, will I show the
salvation of God. Unto thee therefore O God (says David) will I pay my Psalm.
56. 12. Psalm. 107. 22.
vows, unto thee will I give thanks. O that men would praise the Lord for his
goodness, etc! O that they would offer unto him the Sacrifice of
Thanksgiving, and tell out his works with gladness! and so forth all the
Psalm over, you see it is repeated as the foot of his Song. Jonas said, I
will Sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Jonas 2. 9.
Thanksgiving, and will pay thee that that I have vowed: Salvation is of the
Lord. I will praise the Name of God Psalm: 93. 3^.
(says David again,) with a Song, and magnify it with Thanksgiving. This
shall please the Lord better than a 3^.
Bullock that has horns and hooses. Yet cares not the Lord so much for this
in respect of himself, as forman, because there is nothing, that increases
Feeling, Faith, Hope, and Prayer, as this exercise of Thanksgiving does. Let it
therefore be in use with us more and more, that is so accepted of him, to whom
we owe so much.

3 In the 13. verse you see Leaven admitted of, which verse 13.
before you remember was rejected and forbidden. He shall offer his Offering
with cakes of Leauened-bread, etc. Leaven therefore in the Scripture is taken
both in ill part, and in good part. In ill part, Matthew. 16. 6. 1. Cor. 5. 6.
Gal. 5. 9. In good part, Matthew. 13. verse 33. and Luke 13. verse. 21. when the
Apostles are resembled to a little Leaven, that leaueneth the whole Lump, they
being sent out of God into the unleavened world by preaching and teaching to
leaven it clean through. And there is a Leaven of the new nature accepted, as
the Leaven of our old nature is rejected. For look how the Leaven makes the
bread sauourie and strong and wholesome, Look also how it makes it rise and
heave up, which otherwise would be sad and heavy: so does Gods regenerate
Spirit change us, make us sauorie, and all our duties pleasing to God in our
new birth, and we rise up, yea, our hearts and souls are heaued up in all love
and thankfulness to him, that in mercy has so looked upon us. This Leaven
therefore of new nature is accepted. Try your self then in your secret
Meditation, how you are seasoned, whether with old Leaven, or new. It will be
good for you to take this view, and heartily to pray for what you want. Are
you a Minister called of God to leaven his people with good Leaven? Look how
you do it, and be painful: Faithfulness will be crowned, when slothfulness
shall be condemned, and condemn you. And submit your self to the profit of
your people, not hunting after your own glory, that you are thus and so
learned, eloquent, profound, and so forth. If your people profit not, because
you fly too high a pitch for them, and scorn to lay a foundation of the
Catechism among them, you will be found an unprofitable servant in the
Reckoning-day, one that has gained Mat. 25. 2^.
nothing to his Lord, but hid his talent in the foul Napkin of fruitless
matter, and idle figures of affected speech. Are you a hearer and no teacher?
Look at your Leaven: does it heave you up in thanks for the Gospel
vouchsafed unto you? in love to them that truly preach it? in honest life to
them that look at our example? Do you season your children, servants, and
family, as you are able: This is new leaven then in you, and good leaven,
accepted of GOD, and profitable to your self: be thankful for it, and God
increase the measure of it.

4 In the 14. verse you read thus. Of all the Sacrifice Verse 14.
he shall offer one Cake for an heaue-offering unto the Lord etc. And bui one
Cake, (says a Writer upon this Book) was appointed, that it might shadow out
one Holy Communion to be celebrated in time to come of the Church, and not so
many Masses, even Masses upon Masses, etc.

5 In the 15. verse, etc. A Law is made that the 15.
Flesh of the Peace Offerings for thanksgiving, shall be eaten the same day
that it is offered; and nothing thereof left until the Morning. A Ceremony
used (says One) to signify that public Feasts should not be superfluously
continued, and kept long under the color of Religion. For GOD loves not idle
banqueting and prodigal spending, although he allow graciously what is fit
for the occasion. Mariage-Feasts therefore in some Places according to the
equity of this Law are restrained to one day, or two days, and not more. So
of other lawful occasions of meetings. A Ceremony (says Another) made in
wisdom by God; lest, if the Flesh should have smelled by longer keeping,
Religion might Calvin.
so have been vile in the eyes of tickle persons. Happily also (says the same
Person) to restrain vain glory, which some would have showed in sacrificing
often, with small charge, if the meat might have been kept salted, and so
offered again for a glory.

6 But if the Sacrifice of his Offering be a Vow, or a Verse. 16.
Free-offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his Sacrifice:
and so in the Morning the residue thereof shall be eaten. But as much of the
offered flesh as remains Verse 17. Verse 18.
unto the third day, shall be burned with fire. For if any of the Flesh of his
Peace Offerings be eaten in the third day, he shall not be accepted that
offers it, neither shall it be reckoned unto him, but shall be an
abomination: therefore the person that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
That is, the Sin for which he offered, shall still remain and not be
forgiven. The Flesh then of the first sort, must be eaten the same day, and
this of the second sort, in two days, none might be eaten the third day, but
(if any remained) burned. A Ceremony (say some) foretelling and fore-shewing
that this out-ward worship of God by Sacrifices, and such Ceremonies should
have his being no longer, than unto the Resurrection of the Messiah, which was
on the third day. Others make use of this Ceremony thus, eue^ to learn
thereby, that the taking hold of Christ and his benefits, is not to be deferred
and put off, but spedily and quickly to be done, whilst time serves and
opportunity is offered: for behold (says Christ) to day, and to morrow, I cast
out Devils, and the third day, etc. Luke 13. 32. that is, a short Luke 13. 32.
time I have yet to go on with my Ministry, and then I shall be slain. So
the Phrases, to day, and to Morrow, signify a short time, and therefore when
this Law alotteth but one day to eat the one sort, and but two at the uttermost
for the second, well may we learn by it, that whilst by the Preaching of the
Word, the fruit and benefit of Christ is offered, we speedily take hold and
defer not, lest the time elaspe, and we find the door shut against us. This
point has been handled before.

7 Others divide all time into three days (as it were,) and the first day they
make from Adam to Christ; The second, from Christ to the Judgment; and The
third, ever after. In these two first days, the Gate is open to true penitent
sinners, that come when they are called, without putting-off from day to day,
but these two days neglected and ended, there is no more sacrifice for ^^nne,
no more mercy, no Christ, nor Comfort any longer, but a fearful expectation
of judgment, and eternal death for ever. More particularly every man and
woman may be said to have three days; The first of Youth till Age come; The
second of Age till death come; and in these two days there is mercy offered;
but the 3. day is after death, and then no help: As here on the 3. day no
Offering was accepted, but the sin remained unpardoned and not forgiven. All
these applications by Godly men, tending to our good, are agreeable to the
proportion of Faith, and we may be bettered by them.

8 In the 19. verse etc. You have another Law of verse 19.
uncleanness growing by touching. For the Flesh, (says your Chapter) that
touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten, but burnt with fire, etc.
Again, If any eat of Chap. 15. 3. 20.
the Flesh of the Peace Offerings that pertayne to the Lord, having his
uncleanness upon him, even the same person shall be cut off from his people.
Moreover when any 21.
touches any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or of an unclean
beast, or of any filthy abomination and eat of the Flesh of the
Peace Offerings, which pertayneth unto the Lord, even that person shall be
cut off from his people. A man would think, that rather this Flesh of the
Sacrifice representing Christ shonld sanctify all things that it touched, than
be defiled by any thing, so that it might not be eaten. But the Ceremony aptly
teaches, what it was intended for, if you mark it. For as it was meant, it
shows that Christ sanctifies and bettereth none, but such as take hold of
him by a true Faith. To others, if they touch him, he is unclean (not in
himself, who ever is holy and pure, the immaculate Lamb of God) but
accidentally, he is hurtful by reason of their want of Faith, and profaneness,
according to the Scripture. We preach Christ Crucified; 1. Cor. 1, 23.
to the Jews a stumbling-blocke, to the Graecians foolishness: but to them
that are called of both sorts, we Esav 8 14. Luke 2 34. Romans 9. ^3. 1. Peter
2. 7.
preach Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God. And that the
unclean Toucher of this Sacrifice was to be cut off, it taught them the
punishment of unreformed Hypocrites, and still does show what shall be the
end of those that touch Christ, that is, bear his Name and are called
Christians, use his Word, come to his Sacraments, and yet, as the Psalm says,
Hate to be amended: surely, they shall be cut off; their end shall Psalm. 50.
17.
be destruction, and they shall perish eternally. Ever therefore let the prayer
of David be in our mouth, and uttered from our heart, O knit me fast unto
thee, that I Psalm. 86. 11.
may fear thy Name. Let us join inward truth to out-ward show, For the Lord
loves truth in the in-ward parts: Absolon, Ananias and Saphira, Judas, etc,
had Psalm. 51. 6.
their vncleannesie, and how ended they?

9 The forbidding to eat the fat, was a Ceremony, verse 23.
that even at home in their houses continued them after a sort in the exercise
of Religion. For still they remembered 24.
the Law, and obeyed the same. It also (as I have noted before) preached unto
them figuratively, 25.
that for God (if he so appoint) all the sweet pleasures of this world, riches,
honors, friends, and whatsoever else, being as the fat pleasing and
delightful, are forsaken, forborne, refused and left. A Lesson never enough
Nunquam satis dicitur, quod nunqua^ satis discitur.
learned, though often repeated; so clean our hearts to this earth, and this
fatness thereof. But pray often, and pray heartily with Saint Augustine Da
quod iubes, and iube quid vis. Aug.
That the Lord would vouchsafe to give us what he requires, and then require
what he pleases. He is strong though we be weak; can make us as contentedly
leave them, as ever we received and inioyed them.

10 The forbidding of them to eat the blood also, as Verse. 26. 27
before has been noted, signified unto them that the Lord abhors cruelty
in every Child of his, and will have them merciful, pitiful, gentle, etc. In
the 30. verse. Verse 30.
The bringing of the Sacrifice with his own hands, and not sending it by
others, taught humility and duty to God, taught that every one must live by
his own Faith, and not by another; and may serve us now, to see how foolish
an Error it is in Popery, to give another his beads to say them over for him
that day etc. The heauing of it up, was a Figure of the lifting up of Verse 32.
John 12. 32. Numb. 2. 8. 9.
Christ upon the Cross. So was also the lifting up of the Brasen-Serpent. Some
have made it a Figure also of his Exaltation after Death and Hell conquered; of
which the Apostle speaks, when he says, Wherefore God Philip. 2. (...)
has highly exalted him, and given him a Name above all names, that at the
Name of JESUS every knee should bow, etc. That is, has highly exalted him,
and given him Authority and Power, and Rule, whereunto All shall be subject,
men, women, and creatures whatso-euer: Little thinking of any earthly scraping
with the foot, at the Word of Jesus, when neither word, deed, nor thought
yield him reverence due to him. Popish elevation of their consecrated Cake was
never thoughtof in this heauing; and therefore vainly do they use this
proof. The shaking of it too and fro four ways, Verse 34.
East, West, North and South, shadowed the spreading of that lifting-vp of
Christ; that is, of Christ's death and Passion throughout all the world, by the
preaching of the Gospel.

11 Lastly, the breast and the shoulder were the Priests, and so they were
admonished to be as Breasts and shoulders to the people. Breasts, for counsel
and direction in all their affairs: Shoulders, to beare-vp the burden of care
and labor of them, to under go Crosses and troubles in government for them,
and for them to rest, as it were, and lea^e upon, in all their wo^s of heart,
and agonies of mind whatsoever. A profitable Meditation for all faithful
Ministers ever, thus to be, as the Lord shall enable them, to their several
Flocks in this world. And as worthy a Meditation again, for the people to
increase love, and singular love in their hearts, toward their Pastors, for
their work sake, even for this use of them in all their distresses, and
occasions whatsoever. A godly Pastor is a breast of sweet comfort in
adversity, and a faithful Shoulder to lean upon ever, and to support both
us and ours, when without him we shall fall fearfully, and paraduenture
eternally. Happy are the people that have them, and God work in their hearts
to make much of them. In the 37. verse, see a short Rehearsal Verse. 37.
of all the sorts. These are some of the chiefest things in this Chapter.

CHAP. VIII.
IF you turn to the 28. Chapter of Exodus, you shall find the most of this
Chapter there explaned; and therefore a breefer touch may serve here. It
contains the Sacrifices and Ceremonies used at the Consecration of The
contents of this Chapter.
Aaron and his sons into the Priests Office, and fitly follows upon the
other Chapters, because after Sacrifices appointed, the next care is, for
Priests to offer and use them according to appointment. For use and benefit to
our selves; First, let us note, that this Office of holy Priesthood was not of
man, nor Verse. 1. 2.
from man, but the Lord Almighty first instituted and Exodus 28.
ordained it by his own express commandment: then (being ordained) he
confirmed the honor and reputation of it, by that great Miracle of the budding
of Aarons Number. 17. 8.
rod; and he very seuerly and fearfully punished the contempt of it in Corah
and his company, whom the Numb. 16. 32
earth opening swallowed up with their Wives and children, and families all
their goods. Upon Jeroboam also 1. Kin. 13. 4. 2. Chro. 26.
and Vzziah for in^hroching upon it, And the Law was sharp and general: If
any stranger whatsoever (not 19. Numb. 4. 15. Heb. 5. 4.
called to this Office by GOD) approach the Altar, he was to dye. The Reasons
why the Lord thus precisely appointed these Priests, and would not leave it to
every man, to perform this Office, were these and such like. First, it was to
be known, that not every man, No, not any man, but the Man Christ Jesus could
appease Gods wrath, satisfy his justice, and take away the sins of the
world, reconciling us to GOD and putting us in assurance of eternal life. This
could not be figured out better, than by secluding all the whole Host of
Israel from this Office, and choosing but Aaron and his sons as Types of
Christ, this only able Priest to do (as I have said) and therefore they only
were chosen, and so by such ordinance the Majesty, authority, and (if we may
so speak) the propriety of Christ's Office resembled and shadowed. Secondly,
God was ever the God of order, decency, and comelines, and therefore in his
Church would have all things done accordingly, not enduring any to be an
inuader of an other man's right, an intruder of himself into another man's
Office, and a busie-body out of Rule, out of order. Certain men therefore are
appointed, and they only shall do it. Others if they meddle, being strangers,
because not called, shall dye the death, as you hear before. Thus has he also
in the New Testament established a Ministry, and given some Apostles, some
Ephesians. 4. (...).
Evangelists, some Pastors and Doctors for the building-vp of his Church etc.
He also decreed, that the contempt I^^^ 10. 16.
of these, is the contempt of him; and then judge you, first or last, what
punishment will ensue. In neither Old nor New Testament can we find the
Popish Priesthood ordained to Sacrifice for the sins of quick and dead. For
this is to deny the perfection of Christ's one Oblation, and that there is now
remission of sins, seeing the Scripture says, Where there is remission of
sins, Heb. 10. 18. Verse 4.
there is no more offering for sins, etc. Heb. 10. 18.

2 So Moses did as the Lord God commanded him, and the company was assembled
at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. Obedience in Moses the Head
and chief, obedience also in the People under him, do offer us here a good
Example. Such mutual agreement in great and little, to come together to the
Tabernacle to understand further of Gods Will, O, how commendable in it self,
how acceptable to God, how profitable for others that shall behold and see it!
Would God any thing might smite our hearts, to come to Gods House diligently!
Certainly, the praise of it will endure when we are dead, and ye blessing of
such zeal, upon our childre^s children. Banish then ungodly whisperers to the
contrary, with all their deceitful and damnable persuasions: and he that has
an ear let him hear what God will say to his soul. Let him speak as that
good Samuel was taught to speak: Say on Lord, forthy Servant hears. 1. Sam.
3. 9.


3 Then Moses said unto the company, This is the thing which the Lord has
commanded to do. Nothing but Verse 5.
Gods Commandment does Moses offer unto them. For he well knew, Gods will
only, in his own House, must be the Rule. Our own heads were never the best
heads to follow; and for God, he knows our mould too well, to give that
swinge unto us. If we will preach his will, he has a blessing, and if we teach
our own fancies, he will with his breath blow away both us, and our idle
fancies. We offering then but his will to his people, and by a plain course of
teaching, according to their capacities, making that appear to them, as many
as are ordained Act. 13. 48.
to eternal life shall believe in time, to our unspeakable comfort, and their
eternal good^ and such as must perish, (if any such be in our flock) e^^ in
those also, we shall be a sweet savor to God, because we have only 2. Cor. 2.
15. 1. Cor. 11. 23.
delivered to them, what we received of God, and not abused the^, with any man's
Traditions that cannot save.

4 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed verse 6.
them with water, And put upon him the coat, and girded 7.
him with the girdle, etc. Of all these Ceremonies, read what has been noted
in the 29. Chap. of Exodus The verse 10.
Tabernacle, (a type of heaven Heb. 8. 2. cha. 9, 11, 12, 24.) anointed, to
signify that Heaven is the sanctified Place for perpetual and eternal rest,
unto all the Sons of God his Elect, before the foundations of the world were
laid. verse 12.
He powered the Oil upon Aarons head, so in him, who was a Figure of Christ,
shadowing out the fullnes of the Spirit upon Christ, Psalm. 44. and Esaias 61.
verse 13.
He put also coats upon Aarons sons, etc. They were a Figure of the Church,
which by Faith eats also of the Sacrifice of Christ, being made partakers of
his merit as well as the Priests. Their garments figured out the Graces and
gifts, wherewith the believers in Christ are adorned and beautified Rom 13. 12.
Casting away the works of darkness, and putting on daily more and more the
deeds of light. The Lap of verse 23. 24.
Aarons right ear, and his sons thumbes of their right hands, and the great
toes of their feet are What ground Popish greasing ha^h here, judge you, the
Apostles words also remember, protesting that whosoever was circumcised became
a debtor to the whole Law to keep it. Gal. 5. 2. So ^o, etc.
anointed to represent that, In Christo nihil sinistrum, sed omnia dextra.
in Christ there is no left, but all right. To show, that that his blood should
make blessed them Mat. 15. 34.
on his right hand and to teach that such as be his Chosen have their ears
touched and made right, hearing with profit good things, and sincerely
abhorring to hear evil. Their works also, shadowed by their right thumb,
are holy, honest and good, and in their several vocations, they paynfully and
carefully walk, shadowed by their right toes anointed with the blood.

5 Upon Aarons sons, Moses did but sprinckle the Verse 30.
anointing oil, which before was said he powered upon Aaron verse. 12. so
plainly showing, that in Christ the spirit should be without measure, and upon
his servants Ioh. 1. 14, 16. Col. 1. 19.
in measure, we all receiving of his fullness according to his good pleasure
some more, some less.

6 That which is said, of abiding at the door of the Tabernacle day and night,
seven days, and ye shall keep Verse. 35. Consecratio septem dierum significat
totius huius vitae tempus ordinatum diuinitus, vt in eo consecremur in
spirituales sacerdotes. Ante septe^ diem non plene sanctificatus Sacerdos: fic
nec pij ante mortem.
the watch of the Lord, that ye die not; is thought, to have shadowed that
watch, which all our life long (noted by the seven days) we keep in avoiding
sin, and working righteousness, as the Lord shall enable. Which indeed may
be called the wrath of the Lord, being a holy, Christian, and happy watch. The
seventh day we shall be, free, fully sanctified, and delivered from this vale
of misery, to keep an eternal Sabbath in Heaven to our endless comfort. Thus
breefly for order sake of this Chapter, the chief points, (as I said) having
been touched in the 29. of Exodus.

CHAP. IX.
THe Consecration of Aaron and his sons being fully ended, in The Contents of
this Chapter.
this Chap: is showed how they entered upon their Office, and began to do the
duties thereof, Aaron offering the four principal Sacrifices, to wit, the
Burnt-offering; the Sin-offering; the Peace Offering; and the Meat Offering.
And for use unto us. First, it may be observed, that Moses who was never
consecrated himself, does consecrate and inuest Aaron into his Office, that so
men might learn to ascribe all to God, the authority I mean, and effect of
the outward sign.

2 In that Aaron is commanded to offer as well for Verse 7.
himself as his people verse 7. The Apostle to the Hebr. reasons that the
Leuiticall Priesthood was weak, and but a shadow of a stronger, namely of
Christ's. For such an High Priest (says he) it became us to have, as needs
not daily, like those in the Law, to offer up sacrifice first for his own
sins and then for his peoples, etc. Read the 7. Chap. verse 26 27. Also the
5. Chap. Verse 3. He was also herein a Figure of Christ, not that Christ had
any sins of his own, but that ours were so laid upon him, and he so made
satisfaction to God for them, as if they had been his own. Surely, says the
Prophet, He has Isaiah 53. 4.
borne Our infirmities, and carried Our sorrows, yet We did judge him as
plagued and smitten of GOD, and humbled: That is, we judged evil, as though
he were punished for his own sins, and not for ours. But he 5.
was wounded for Our transgressions, he was broken for Our iniquites, the
chastesment of Our peace was upon him, and with his stripes We are healed.

3 When it is said, Aaron lift up his hand and blessed Verse. 22.
the people, verse 22. We must consider, that herein he was plainly a Figure
of Christ, who only can bless, being only the seed of Abraham, In whom all
the Nations of the world are blessed, and in whom (says Genesis 18. 18. Ephe. 1.
3.
S. Paul, The Father has blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly
things: As with the blessing of Reconciliation to himself, reputing us now
just for his Son Christ, and Sons and Heirs of all heavenly benefits: with
the blessing of his Spirit, whereby we walk in his calling, being guided and
governed thereby in the same: with the blessing of acceptance of all our works
(though full of imperfection and weakness) and with this great blessing, That
all adversity becomes a help to us, to draw us to Heaven and eternal rest,
etc. How are we bound to love such a GOD? Let us often fall into the reckoning
of it, and rise up in thankful speeches and thoughts, as others of his
servants have done before us, upon the same cause, Namely, Saint Augustine,
whose words are these: Minus te amat, O Deus, qui aliquid tecum amat, quod non
propter te amat. O GOD, he loves thee not as much as he should, who loves
any thing else but thee, which he loves not for thee. Saint Cyprian: Disce
nihil Deo praeponere, quia Deus nihiltibi praeposuit; Learn (O man) to prefer
nothing in thy love before God, because he has preferred nothing before thee
in his love; No, no, not the life and blood of his own dear and only Son.
Saint Bernard: Quando ignorabam, me instruxit; quando errabam, me reduxit;
quando steti, me tenuit; quando cecidi, me erexit; quando veni, me suscepit
etc: O quid retribuam? When I was ignorant, he instructed me; when I erred, he
reclaymed me; when I stood, he held me up; when I fell, he raised me; when I
came to him, he received me etc, O what should I give to the Lord for these
favors? etc.

4 And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. Verse. 23. 24.
And there came a fire out from the Lord, and consumed upon the Altar the
Burnt-offering, and the fat: which when all the people saw, they gave thanks,
and fell on their faces: (or, they gave a shoute for joy.) Thus did the Lord
please to confirm both that manner of worshipping him, by such Sacrifices and
the Ministry of Aaron, and his sons now chosen and consecrated to that
Office. The like credit he gave to Elias his Prophet, When fire from Heaven
came down, and consumed the 1. King 18. 38.
Burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the
water that was in the ditch. Which the people also saw, and there fell again
upon their faces, 39.
and said: The Lord He is GOD; The Lord He is GOD. Again, When Solomon had
made an end of 2. Cro. 7. 1.
praying, fire came down from Heaven, and consumed the Burnt-offering, and the
Sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the House. Such mercy in the Lord
to meet with man's weakness, is duly and carefully to be thought of, all
peevish frowardness to be instructed and to believe, (as a most unfit thing
for any that look for Heaven) to be abandoned and cast away; Left after all
means in mercy offered to win us and save us, we be destroyed with some
fearful judgment, that all the world may talk of us for our obstinacy.
This (I say) because even this gracious God is the same to man, by his
Holy-word and infinite favors, seeking us as lost Sheep to be won unto him.
Let us read, let us search, let us day and night endeavor to know his holy
Will; and then constantly and faithfully walk in the same, whilst we have a
day to live. This fire from Heaven did not plainlier confirm them, than the
evidence of his Word does all those at this day, that will look into it. And
as well may we at this day fall upon our faces, and give a shoute in
thankfulness for the great glory of the same, in the Ministry of his
Servants endued with great gifts of knowledge and power to expound and open the
same unto us, as they did here, or in other places, for such visible
Lestimonies of his approbation. God strike us, and work with us for his
mercies sake, that we may live and not die, praising and blessing his Name for
ever, for his Godnesse.

Amen, Amen.
CHAP. X.
IN the former Chapter, having showed verse 13.
by that miracle of fire from heaven, how he accepts of worship done
according to his will; now in this, by a dreadful judgment upon the two
sons of Aaron, he shows how he abhors all presumption of man, to serve
him any other way. The sin and death of the young men for their sin, is
layd-downe in these words, But Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, Verse 1.
took either of them his Censar, and put fire therein, and put incense
thereupon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he had not
commanded them. Therefore a fire went out from the Lord, and devoured them; so
they 2. Locum sacrum etiam ingressi sunt, quod ne summo quide^ sacerdoti
licebat, nisi semel in anno. Tremelius.
dyed before the Lord. Their sin was then, that to burn incense withal,
they took not the fire from the Altar, of that which came down from Heaven,
and was preserved by the diligence of the Priests, till the Captivity of
Babylon, but other fire, which therefore is called strange fire, because it was
not fire appointed and commanded. Which fault in man's eyes may seem to have
excuse, ann not to deserve so fearful a punishment. For they were but yet
green in their office, and so of ignorance might offend, being not yet well
acquainted with the nature of their Office. Again, of forgetfulness they
might offend, not remembering or thinking of the matter, as they ought. Thirdly,
there was no malice in them, or purpose to do evil, but wholly they aimed at
Gods service, with a true meaning, although in the manner they missed somewhat.
But all these and whatsoever like excuses, were as figge-leaues before God,
vain and weak to defend them from guiltiness, in the breach of his
commandment, and not withstanding any such, they are thus fearfully and
dreadfully devoured with fire from God, that they then, we no^, and all flesh
to the worlds end, might learn and settle in our hearts, two things. First,
with what severity the Lord challenges and defends his authority, in
laying-downe the way and manner of his worship, not leaving it to any creature
to meddle with, but according to prescription and appointment from him; Content
he is, that men shall make laws for humane matters, concerning their worldly
estate in this earth, as shall be fittest for the place where they live; laws
against murder, theft, oppression etc. but for his divine worship he onlywill
prescribe it himself, and what he appoynteth, that must be done, and that
only, or else Nadab and Abihu their punishment expected, that is, Gods wrath
expected, in such manner as he shall please. The Point is good to be carefully
marked, and would god it might take full place in all hearts! The Scriptures
are plain, and they would be seriously thought of, you shall not do every man
what seems good in his Deuteronomy. 12 8. etc Deuteronomy. 4. 10.
own eyes but what I command, what I, I command, that, that, shall ye do
etc. Read all the Chapter. Look in every Chapter of the book of Judges how,
still, still they were delivered over to their adversaries for transgressing in
this behalf. All the days of Joshua, says Judge. 2. 7.
the Story there, and all the days of the Elders that outliued Joshua which
had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel. But when
that generation 10.
was gathered to their fathers, there arose up an other generation, which
neither knew the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel, And
these did wickedly in 11.
the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim etc. Wherefore 14.
the wrath of the Lord was hot against them, and he delivered them into the
hands of spoylers etc. And whithersoeuer 15.
they went the hand of the lord was sore against them, etc. Mark with your
self, the vehemency of these words, and the greatness of this wrath for
worshipping him after other ways than he himself appointed. In the 8. Chap.
Gedeons Ephod made without Judge. ^. 27.
warrant, did it please? O mark the words. All Israel went a whoring after it,
which was the destruction of Gedeon, and his house. He and his house perished
for worshipping God otherwise, than God himself appointed. This is no small
punishment, if God give a heart to think of it fruitfully. The like you read
of Saul who would offer sacrifice contrary to the word, He and his house also
perish for it. Ieroboams golden Calves 1. Sam. 15. 23.
set-vp without warrant, and worshipped without warrant, overthrew him and all
his also, I exalted thee, says 1. King. 14. 7.
God to Jeroboam, and made thee Prince over my people Israel, etc, But thou
have not been as my servant David, which kept my Commandments, and followed
me with 8.
all his heart, and did only that which was right in mine eyes. For thou have
gone and made thee other Gods, and 9.
molten Images, to provoke me, and have cast me behind thy back: And
therefore behold, I will bring evil upon 10.
thy house, and will cut of him that pisseth against the wall, (every Male even
to the dogs, as the Marginall Note has) and I will sweep away the remnant
of thy house, as a man sweepeth away doung till it be all gone. Judge then in
your secret thought, hearing these words, whether it be a small matter, to
worship God otherwise than he in his word appoints to us. It is a very
memorable Note.
thing, that is written of Gregory sometimes Bishop of Rome, (the best of all
that followed him, the worst of all that went before him) how he, in a most
grievous plague, devised and appointed those Supplitions to Saints set down in
the Letanie, having for it neither commandment, nor example, nor any warrant
in the word, but all to the contrary very plainly, and that so God revenged
this wicked boldness, as in one hour, fourscore of those that so prayed and
rehearsed those suffrages, suddenly fell to the earth, and breathed out their
last breath. Thus the Lord likes devises of men in his service. Why should not
all flesh be resolved then, that, in vain do we worship God, teaching for
Mat. 15. 5.
doctrine, men's precepts? And consequently, of the impudency of that speech of
a Popish Doctor, that, GOD respects not so much what we do, as with what
mind we do it. The untaught Romans understood more truth than this man,
when being moved to receive Christ into the number of their gods, they
answered, that every God must needs be served according to his will, and not
according to his worshippers will; and therefore since they understood that
Christ would have no fellows, but would be worshipped alone, they must needs
either forgot all their other Gods, which they might not do, or worship him
otherwise than his will was, which would offend him. So they resolved to reject
him, which turned to the destruction of them in the end. Discamus Deum, ex
ipsius voluntate, honorare, etc, Let us learn to worship God according to his
Will, says S. Chrysostom, etc. Cyprian tells us, We must follow Cypr.
lib. 2. Epist. 3. contra Aquarios. 1. Cor. 11. 23. Coloss. 2. 22. 23. Vatablus
in Annot: in Deuteronomy: 4.
Christ, and he that does not so, is not a Priest of God, but walks in
darkness. Paul says, He delivered to them what he had received, etc: He
condemned all voluntary worship. A learned Professor in Paris affirms
boldly, that men's praecepts turn people from the truth, and seduce the hearts
of the simple: therefore (says he) God tyeth us so strictly to his Word
without adding or diminishing, etc.

2 But does not a good intent and meaning prevail Good intent:
with God, albeit the thing be not expressly warranted? Your self judge, by
that which you see here, and in many other Scriptures, making this the second
of the two things, I said were here to be observed. Had Nadab and Abihu the
sons of Aaron here, any ill meaning toward God, or did they of malicious
purpose offend him, and procure their own destruction? No, you must needs
think their intent, was good, but because they swarued from the word, that
good intent served not. The words out of Deutro. cited before, are not, you
shall not do ill in your own eyes, but you shall not do Deuteronomy. 12. 8.
that which seems good, good I say, and I pray you mark it, you shall not do
that, but shall keep you to my commandment. Be it never so good then in my
conceit, that is, be my meaning never so good, it profits not, neither shall
excuse Gods destroying wrath, more than it did here these sons of Aaron.
There is a way Prou 14. 12.
says Solomon, that seems good to a man and right, but theyssues thereof are
the ways of death. Such assuredly are all will worships, not grounded upon the
word, but upon man's will, and good intent. They shall excommunicate you (says
our Savior Christ) Yea, the time John 16. 2.
shall come, that whosoever kills you will think that he does God good
service. What then? shall his so thinking excuse his bloody murder? Joseph had
no ill meaning, when he prayed his Father, to change his Genesis 48. 18.
hand, and to lay his right hand upon his elder sons head. What ill meant
Joshua when he wished Moses to Numb. 11. 28. Judge. 17. 3. 1. Sam. 15. 15.
Matthew. 16. 22. Luke 18. 15. Luke 9. 54. John 13. 8.
forbid those that prophesied? Michas mother when according to her vow, she
made her sons two Idols. Saul when he saved alive the sheep of the
Amalekites, etc. Peter when he had Christ, his Master, to pity himself. The
Disciples of Christ when they forbadde little Children to come unto him, when
they would have commanded that fire should come from Heaven, etc. Peter's
meaning had no hurt in it, when he forbad Christ to wash his feet: with a
number like places in Scripture: yet you know no good intent was accepted in
these cases. No more, no more shall it ever be, when it is not agreeing to the
Word, which only is a Christian man and woman's true and perfect guide. Let
therefore these things take place with us, and never wrostle we against the
Lord, for he is too strong for us. and his will must stand, not ours. O why
should it grieve me to be ruled by his word, seeing it is so sure a way for
me to walk in? Or why should any Teacher deliver to me, that which he never
received of God, to be delivered to his people? If they crave obedience, why
should they be angry, that I pray to have it showed out of his word, whom
only I must obey? He has prescribed a form of serving him, that form he
will accept and bless with eternal peace; all other forms he will abhor
and punish. Nadab and Abihu preach so unto us and all flesh. They wish us to
take heed by their harm: God is in other things full of patience, but in this,
he is full of wrath, and his authority, to appoint his own worship, he will
not endure it to be taken from him by any man. Let Popish whisperers then, make
good out of Gods word Latin Prayers when we understand no Latin, Calling upon
Saints that hear us not; Flying from the sufficiency of Christ's Passion, to
our own merits, crossings and creepings, with a thousand devised toys, and we
will obey them. But if they cannot, let them leave us to serve God, according
to his word, that we may be accepted.

3 You may also well note it here, that Nadab and Abihu, were two of Aarons
eldest sons, which after their father should in his place have succeeded him,
yet there is no mercy with God, to stay his judgment, when they will not be
ruled by his word. No prerogative therefore of any man, shall save him from
wrath, if he thus offend, but the eldest shall die, as well as a younger, the
richest as well as the poorer, a great man or woman as well as a small. There is
no regard with God of these things But the soul that serves him according to
his own will reueiled in his Word, that is regarded, and ever dear unto him,
etc. Build we not therefore, upon any titles, and so swerve from the rule laid
down unto us. If so little a transgression cannot be qualified any way, by any
circumstance; O what will be their case one day, that so many ways stray from
the Law of God, and almost in no one jot of their worship, have any warrant?
Think with your self more of this matter, and meditate further of it at your
times.

4 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is that the Verse. 3.
Lord spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and
before all the people I will be glorified. You can conceive what woe it was to
Moses, to see this end of two of his brothers sons, but he must stoop to
God, and so he does, telling Aaron the truth of the fault, and so consequently
defending God, that he did but justly. In deed (says he) we must confess
that this is that we were told before, how God will be sanctified in them that
come near unto him: that is, how he will have his Law obeyed and followed in
his worship, and not any way else, how though he use the Ministry of man, yet
no man living must be wiser than He, to swerve from the form appointed, and
to follow his own liberty, but man must think it his wisdom, to do as God
bids, etc.

5 But Aaron held his peace, (says the Text) that is, Verse. 3. (...)
was so astonished with the fearefulnes of it, that he had no speech, but all
amazed and shaken with the woe of it, held his peace. He howled not out with
any vnse^mly cries, neither uttered any words of rage and impatiencie, but
meekly stooped to Gods will, kissed his rod, and held his peace. If thus
Aaron in so great a judgment, how much more we, when our friends dye
naturally, sweetly, and comfortably, so that we may boldly say, No^ amisimus,
sedpraemisimus; We have not lost them, but sent them before us, whether we our
selves hope to follow. Lay to this heavy hearted father, yet silent and
patient, the example of old father Elye the Priest, to whom when Samuel had
related such fearful things, quietly he answered. It is the Lord, let him do
what seems 1. Sam. 3. 18.
him good. The example also of David, who in his distress very bitter and
heavy, yet notably said, Let 2. Sam. 15. 26.
the Lord do to me as seems good in his eyes. These are most excellent
Paterns for us to follow in all our crosses and griefs, not forgetting that
golden Saying of Job, We have taken good things at Gods hands, and Job. 2. 10.
Job. 1. 21.
shall we not take evil? O yes, yes, The Lord gives, and the Lord takes, and
ever, ever, blessed be his Name for all. The fish grows greater in salt
waters, and the Lord for his mercy make our Faith, Patience, and Comfort in
him great, in the saltest and bitterest waters of this world. Amen.

6 Observe here again with your self, the strange and admirable change of
these worldly matters, in the turn, (as we say) of a hand. For but Yesterday
(as it were) Aaron and these sons of his had a famous and glorious
consecration, into the greatest and highest dignity upon earth, (nothing under
the Sun being more glorious than that Priesthood in those days) And how may
you think his heart rejoiced to see, not only himself, but his children,
(which Parents often love more than themselves) so blessed and honored? But, O
change now sudden and fearful! O fickle fading comfort that man takes hold
of in this world, whatsoever it be, if wordly: These sons so lately exalted
and honored to their old Fathers sweet and great joy, now lie destroyed before
his face, to his extreme and twitching torment. And how? Not by any ordinary
and accustomed death, but by fire from Heaven, a sore and dreadful judgment.
For what also? Even for breach of commanded duty by the Lord, all which
doubled and trebled the fathers sorrow. As it did in David when his son
Absolon died not an usual death, and in rebellion and disebedience against his
king and Father. You remember his passion then uttered. O my 2. Sam. 18. 33.
son Absolon, my son, my son Absolon; would God I had died for thee, O
Absolon, my son, my son. He considered the cause wherein he dyed, and the
manner how he dyed; to a father so kind as David was, both of them full of woe
and sorrow. Let never therefore any prosperity in this world puff us: for we
little know, what to morrow-day may bring with it; The glass that glistereth
most, is soonest broken; the rankest corn is soonest laid, and the fullest
bough with pleasant fruit is soonest slit, having more eyes upon it, and more
stones cast at it, than all the other boughs of the tree. Pleasant wine makes
wise men fools, and fools often stark mad. Thousands fall at the left hand,
but ten Psalm. 91. 7.
thousand at the right. Multos fra^git aduersitas, sed plures extollit
prosperitas: Many (says Saint Bernard,) are crushed Bernard.
with adversity, but more are puffed up by prosperity. Lacertus Milonem
perdidit, ambitio Caesarem. Nimis alter Naturae, nimis alter Fortunae credidit.
Milo his strong arm overthrew him, and Caesar his ambition. The one trusted
too much to Nature, and the other to Fortune. As a Spiders web; so is a man's
greatness in this world, soon wiped away with a little whiske. Often therefore
think of Saint John's words: Love not this world, neither the things that are
in the world. If any man love 1. John 2. 15.
this world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all 16.
that is in this world (as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
pride of life) is not of the Father, but is of the world. And this world
passes away, and the lust thereof: 17.
but he that fulfilleth the Will of GOD abides for ever.

7 But was Aaron hated of God, because this fearful hap fell upon his
Children? No, no. Therefore learn to stay your hasty nature from judging
rashly, and be not carried away by a prattling world. Ever remember what Cross
is laid here, not upon a mean man in the Church, but upon him that had the
highest place, that was a Figure of Christ, and accepted of him, and meditate
of it much with your self for your comfort etc.

8 Note in the 4. and 5. verses, the manner of bury all, Verse 4. 5.
not in the Host, but without in the fields prepared and kept for such use.
Where was then ye superstitious conceit of Churches and Churchyards? Their
friends and kins-men carry them forth to burial, and the custom is still
commendable amongst us.

9 After Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and Verse. 6.
Ithamar his sons; uncover not your heads, neither rent your clothes least
ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people; but let your brethren, all
the House of Israel bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled. In this
case it was not lawful for Aaron and his sons to mourn, least they should
seem to prefer their carnal affection to God his just judgment. And it is a
great Caveat to all such, as desire to govern themselves in an acceptable
course. Of mourning for the dead, and the manner of Nations differing in the
same, more may be said in the 19. Chapter.

10 But the people here might mourn, that it might ever be learned, noted, and
remembered, how nearly and truly the grief of the Minister should touch a
loving and godly people. But where, where is such a people? God forbid but we
should assure our selves, there is a portion that does thus, although all that
reap the labors as well as they, dee it not. And let it be a faithful
Ministers comfort ever, that me love him, and suffer with him in any grief of
his, than he knows off. I know what I say, and my soul blesses the Lord
for my experience in this point. My infirmities are many, and my weakness to
do service has ever been great, I know it, I acknowledge it in humility
before him that knows, whether I lie, or no. Yet has it been his good
pleasure, ever since I was first a Minister, to show himself strong in my
weakness, and to give a gracious blessing to my poor Labors in diverse
places, that I might well learn, it is all one to him to work with small
gifts and with great. And touching the thing I spoke of, I have found this love
in some for my only Ministry sake, that I have been advertised by writing,
of matters much concerning me, and to this day could never learn and know who
they were. The Lord reward it ten thousand fold into their bosoms, if they
be living, and upon theirs, if they be gone to God. Thus much breaks from
me in this place out of a thankful heart to GOD, and to them; and for a true
comfort to my Brethren in this Land, lighting upon these my weak labors; that
besides their own experience, they know also mine, that howsoever all are not
kind and loving, where we live and labor, yet more are our faithful friends
than we know. And therefore let us go on through all reports 2. Cor. 6. 8.
good and bad, and through all crosses great and small: do the work whereunto
we are called, and rest vpvpon him that will never fail us nor let us fall.

11 And they did according to Moses commandment, Verse 7.
says the Text. So will the rod of God waken his people and work obedience.
For which cause the Lord often lays it where he loves, not willing, as
himself says, the death of a sinner, but rather that he may Ezekiel. 18. 32
turn and live.

12 Thou shall not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, Verse. 9.
nor thy sons with thee, when ye come into the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, lest ye die: This is an Ordinance for ever throughout your
Generations. That ye 10.
may put difference betwixt the holy and the unholy, and between the clean
and the unclean: And that ye may teach the Children of Israel all the
Statutes which the 21.
Lord has commanded them by the hand of Moses. Sobriety is a virtue fit for
all men, but especially for Ministers of the Word and Sacraments. Thus much in
this Law the Lord shadowed, and we may truly learn, wine was forbidden them
absolutely, when their turn came to minister: but now, that Law binds not.
Yet to Sobriety, with wine, and without wine, we are ever bound. Let a
Minister (says the Apostle) be no drinker 1. Tim. 3. 3.
of wine, meaning disorderly and unfitly, for otherwise Timothy is exhorted to
drink a little wine for his stomacke-sake, Chap. 5. 23. Ephe. 5. 18.
and his often infirmities. To all men the same Apostle says again: Be not
drunk with wine Vinum est blandus demon, dulce venenum, suaue peccatum, quo
qui delectatur, non facit peccatum, sed totus est peccatu^. August.
wherein is excess, but be fullfilled with the spirit, etc. The reason added,
that thus they might be sound and sincere Interpreters of the Law. For the
chief Office of the Priests, was not to kill beasts and offer Sacrifices, but
to have knowledge, and to teach the people the difference betwixt the true God
and false Idolles, betwixt holy things and profane, betwixt right prayer and
wrong, concerning the Law and sin, and grace, etc. according to the Prophet
Malachies Speech: The lips of the Priest shall keep knowledge and they shall
seek Malach. 2. 7.
the Law at his mouth, for he is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts. But here
is no thought in this Law of any proud and Anabaptisticall separation of our
selves from the fellowshippe of our Brethren, and the unity of the Church,
under a color that we are holy and others profane. Beware we ever of such
Doctrine, and such Teachers.

13 Then Moses said to Aaron and unto Eleazar and Verse 12.
Ithamar his sons that were left, Take the Meat Offering, etc. This is added
to comfort and strengthen the shaken hearts of Aaron and his living sons, who
might by this strange punishment have been driven into doubt, whether ever the
Lord would be pleased, that they should meddle again with the Sacrifices. And
we see therein a sweet and gracious God, who makes not his promises void to
all, for the faults of some, but only teaches, to beware by other men's harms.
We must therefore cleave to our Calling, and even so much the more painfully
go forward therein, by how much we see others punished for ill-doing. There
is as certain reward with GOD for well-dooing, as there is punishment for the
contrary. Be taught therefore (I say) and schooled, but never be discouraged
and feared from imposed duty.

14 And Moses sought the Goat that was offered Verse 16.
for sin, and lo it was burned; therefore he was angry with Eleazar and
Ithamar the sons of Aaron, which were left alive, etc. Part of this Goat
being a Sinne-offering, should have been eaten, I mean, the shoulder and
breast allotted to the Priest, but it was all burned contrary to the Law. For
which Moses was justly offended, having seen so lately Gods wrath upon the
other fault. The answer of Aaron you have in the 19. verse, Verse 19.
in effect and sense, as if he should have said. I confess and acknowledge
the Ordinance of God is to be kept, and we are to eat with joy of the parts
allotted unto us of the Sacrifice for sin, the blood whereof was not brought
into the Tabernacle of the Testimony. But how could I eat with joy, in so
heavy and woeful a case of my children? Compelled therefore with the
greatness of my grief, I did what I did etc. At which answer, says your
Chapter, Moses was content, so Verse. 20.
bearing with his infirmity, considering his great sorrow, but not leaving an
example to forgive them that maliciously transgress the commandment of God.
And as Moses is said to have stayed his anger, so you see the Lord himself
did, not punishing again this fault. It lays open unto us the great
kindness of our gracious God, of whom the Psalm says, He is full of
compassion Psalm. 103. 8.
and mercy, long suffering and of great goodness. He will not always be
chiding, neither keeps he his anger for ever. He deals not with us after
our sins: neither 9. 10.
rewards us according to our wickedness, etc. Secondly, you may see here,
how these Ceremonial Laws 1 Samuel 21. 6. Mat. 12. 4.
gave place to necessity, as David also in necessity did eat the Shewbread,
which was otherwise unlawful for him to do: and Ezechias admitted to the
Passover those that were not cleansed. But for Moral Laws, there is no
dispensation for corporal necessity, but a constant course must be held in
obeying them. For it is not necessary that I should live, but it is ever
necessary that I should live righteously. Lastly, in that Moses admitted a
reasonable excuse, we may learn to abhor pride, and to do the like. Pride
I say, which scorneth to hear what may be said against the conceit we have
once harbored. A modest man or woman does not thus. But even for his servant
and his maid, holy Job had an Job. 31. 13.
ear, and did not despise their judgment, their complaint or grief, when
they thought themselves evil entreated by him. The example of God himself is
in stead of a thousand, who mercifully both heard and accepted of Abimelech his
excuse for taking away Abraham his wife. I know (says he) that thou did it
even with Genesis 20. 6.
an vpright-minde, and therefore I kept thee also that thou should not sin
against me, etc. Shall the Lord be thus sweet, and we so dogged, so churlish,
so stern, and sower, that no excuse may serve for a thing done amiss, if once
we have taken notice of it? Beware, beware, and remember your own frailty
well. A stubborn frowardness has hurt many, sweet gentleness and courtesy
never any, but though wicked men were unthankful, yet our gracious God was
pleased. And thus of this Chapter.

CHAP. XI.
IT belonged to the Priests Office in those days not only to teach True
Doctrine to the people, to pray for them, and to offer Sacrifices appointed by
God, but also to discern and judge betwixt things clean and unclean.
Therefore having hitherto spoken of Sacrifices and the Ceremonies thereof, now
Moses comes to speak of unclean things: Namely, Men and Women unclean,
Meats unclean, Houses, Garments, Marriages, and such like, directing the
Priest how he should judge in this behalse truly, neither make that unclean
which was not, nor that clean which God made unclean. This Chapter which now
you read, speaks of unclean meats, beasts, Fishes, The sum of the
Chapter.
and Birds. Whereof, before we consider according to the Text, we may all
remember the state of this matter, concerning difference of meat as in the
Scripture we are taught. First then, in Genesis you read thus, Behold, I have
given unto you every herb bearing seed, Genesis 1. 29.
which is upon all the earth, which has life in it self, every green herb
shall be for meat, and it was so. No flesh as yet then granted to man. In the
9 Chapter you read thus. Every thing that moves, and lives, shall be meat for
Genesis 9. 3.
you, even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the
life thereof, I mean with the blood 4
thereof, shall ye not eat etc. Here is flesh granted also as well as
herbs, and only the blood thereof excepted. But now in this Chapter of
Leuiticus, many sorts of meats are forbidden as unclean. Was this perpetual?
No, it was but Ceremonial, and for a time. Wherefore the Apostle was bold to
say in his time, and for all times after. Let no man condemn you in meat and
Coloss. 2. 16.
drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the New Moore, or of the Sabbath
days, which are but a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ. And
whereof a shadow? First, these things shadowed the duty of man, to depend upon
the word and will of his God in all things, yea, even in his meat. Secondly,
how careful he ought to be to seek cleanenes of body and soul before the
Lord, and to avoid the contrary, which by the fall of our first Parents, was
and is so crept into all their posterity, Esaias. 64. 6.
as now our very righteousness, that is, our best things are but as a foul,
filthy, stained cloth. Thirdly, how God had made a difference betwixt them, and
all other the Nations of the world, reputing them in his mercy Deuteronomy. 14. 1. 2.
as clean, and all other people as unclean, that is, accepting them for his
People before all others. Remember the Uision of Peter, in the Acts; and the
meaning of Act. 10. 15.
it, Namely, that Peter should not forbear to go to the Gentiles, in respect
of any former difference betwixt Jew and Gentile, for this should be to call
that unclean, which God had made clean. God now had broken down by his
sons Passion, the partition wall, Ephe. 2. 14.
and Gentile as well as Jew should be accepted, the Ceremony of those meats
clean and unclean, which shadowed out this partition and difference, now
having his end and being finished. Kill and eat (now) of all Act. 10. 13.
Mat. 28. 19.
meats; and Go, and teach (now) all Nations: Call not any meat (now) any
more unclean, for all is clean to Tit. 1. 15.
them that are clean: And put no difference (now) betwixt Cornelius and a
Jew, for all are clean: that is, In every Nation he that fears God, and
works righteousness Act. 10. 35.
is accepted. In the Gospel therefore, there is now no difference of meats,
but all meat free with 1. Tim. 4. 4. Matthew. 15. 11.
Thanksgiving. That which goes into the mouth defiles not the man, but that
which comes out of the mouth, that defiles the man: says our true Teacher,
Christ Jesus, and we must mark it. His Apostle (after Romans 14. 14.
him) Saint Paul, I know and am persuaded through the Lord Jesus, that there is
nothing unclean of it self; but unto him that judges any thing unclean, to
him it is unclean. Whatsoever therefore is sold in the Shambles, eat 1. Cor.
10. 25. 1. Tim. 4. 1. etc.
ye, and ask no question for conscience sake. Nevertheless there shall come
in the latter days some that shall forbid to marry, and command to abstain
from meats which God has created to be received with Thanksgiving. For it
is sanctified by the Word of God, and Prayer. But these forbidders and
commanders, are departed from the Faith: give heed unto the spirits of error,
and doctrines of Devils. They speak lies through hypocrisy, and they have
their consciences burned with an hot iron. O note these things earnestly with
your self, and acknowledge Gods goodness in thus plainly fore-warning us long
before, of that which we see in these days fulfilled. Unto the pure (says
the same Apostle) Tit. 1. 15.
all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, nothing
is pure, but even their minds and consciences are defiled, etc. That
Commandment to abstain from things offered to Idolles, and from blood: In the
Acts of the Apostles, was but for a time, and is ended also in Christ, or else
it was no Ceremonial law. But Acts 15. 20.
you think per adventure with your self, may not the Church in these days
also forbid some kind of meat as flesh, etc? The answer is, that cause and
circumstance must be considered, Ciuilie the Magistrate may, that is, for the
good of the Commonwealth, in maintaining Mariners for service, in helping ye
young breed of Cattle that victual may be more cheap, by sparing the eating for
a time, and so forth, but not for Religion and Conscience, as if one meat
pleased God more than another: for (as you heard) Peter's sheet with all sorts
Act. 10. Coloss. 2. 20. etc.
of meats confuteth that; many other Scriptures also, which yo^ may read your
self over. But what if one pretend the Magistates law being indeed popish, and
making Romans 14. 17. Heb. 13. 9.
difference of meats for religion? You must needs confess such an one is an
Hypocrite, and therefore odious to God, who hates hypocrisy, and cannot be
mocked. And what if he do it in deed for Religion? Then he denies in
effect, that Christ is yet come, and has taken away this Ceremonial Law of
unclean meats, Gal. 5. 2.
and as the Apostle says, of Circumcision, that if we be circumcised now,
Christ profits nothing; so is it true also, that if we yet hold a difference
of meats for Religion and Conscience, Christ to us is no Christ, and we shall
perish. What if I sincerly in regard of the Magistrates Civil Law, for the
good of the Land, forbear to eat any flesh upon times named by Law, yet well
knowing my liberty in Christ? You do most well, and would God the Land had
more of these, that would obey godly Laws according to their meaning, and
abandon all sinful riot and liberty contrary to them. GOD should be pleased,
the Magistrate pleased, our Country profited, and we known to God and man
for people of g^ouernment and order.

2 But how did God in this Law of his, call that unclean which himself had
made and saw to be good, as Genesis 1. 31.
all his works were good? Surely, in respect of Creation, and of themselves
nothing is evil or unclean, but in respect of use forbidden, as God has
liberty to forbid at his good pleasure, without impeachment of himself, or of
his Creature; Even as the Tree of Knowledge of Gen: 2. 17.
good and evil hurt not of it self, or the apple, but the transgression after
Commandment, the thing in it self good, but the use forbidden. If you say,
that which Mat: 15. 11.
goes into the mouth defiles not, and therefore not the apple; it is true,
for the apple defiled not, but the breach of Gods Commandment, You shall not
eat: So that Romans 14. 17.
ever it was true, The Kingdom of GOD is not meat or drink, etc.

3 How were beasts called unclean in the time of Noah, when they entered into
the Arc before this Law was made, except of themselves and their Nature, they
were so? I answer you truly, they were then so called, not in respect of any
fault in themselves, or of eating, but in regard of the Sacrifices, from which
God did then exclude them, as here he did from being eaten. And as well might
God then, at his good pleasure, choose what he would have offered for
Sacrifice, and what not; as now what he would have eaten, and what not; all
being his, and his prer^gatiue to do with his own as he pleases. As now
therefore, that which was forbidden to be meat, is called unclean, yet not so
in Nature, but in regard of use thereof forbidden; so then, was that called
unclean, which was forbidden to be Sacrificed, and not for any evil nature at
the Creation, but only because of this prohibition of use that way. Now let us
a little look at the words of the Chapter.

1 In the Chapter you see three sorts Namely beasts, of the Land, Fishes of the
Sea, and Fowls of the Air, and these are distinguished or noted by Names; and
by Signs. The Names that are here set down, We are not so well acquainted
with some of them, because in those East-parts, there were diverse creatures not
known to us in these Countries, by their Names. The Beasts.
Signs therefore is the best note for us, and in the beasts they are these,
dividing the hoof, and chewing the Verse. 3.
cudde, for so says the Text. Whatsoever parts the hoof, and is cloven
footed, and cheweth the cudde amongst the beasts, that shall ye eat. But if
he did the one, and not the other, or neither, he was unclean; Read the
words your self. You saw before that these were but shadows of other things.
For does God regard Oxen, (says the Apostle) and cares he for dividing, or
not dividing the hoof, chewing, or not chewing (...) Cor. 9. 9.
the cudde: who made them all as they are, and could have made them all of one
sort, otherwise than hereby to resemble berter matters? No. And therefore
consider with your self, that in this difference of beasts, the Lord shadowed
out a difference of men and women in this world, some clean, and some
unclean. The clean beasts resemble the Godly and Elect which being cleansed
by Faith in Christ from their sins, and sanctified by the Spirit of GOD,
earnestly and fervently love the Word of God, hear it, learn it, embrace it,
Night and Day meditate of it, laboring to keep it by framing all their words
and works, counsels and actions according to it. The unclean beasts resemble
the wicked and reprobate that despise the Word, and live as the Dog that
returns to his vomit, Or the Swine 2. Pet. 2. 22.
that walloweth in the mire, that is, wickedly, filthily, and beastly. This
taught Irenaeus many years ago, Irenaeus lib. 5.
and both for his antiquity and worthiness let us mark his words. They that
have the Pledge of the Spirit, (says he) and serve the concupiscence of the
flesh, but subject themselves to the Spirit, and reasonably behave themselves
in all things, rightly of the Apostle are called spiritual, because the Spirit
of GOD dwells in them. And they that cast away the Counsel of the Spirit,
and serve the pleasures of the flesh, living unreasonably, and vnbridledly,
following their sinful desires, having no working of the Spirit, but living as
dogs or swine, rightly he calls carnal because they savor of nothing but
the flesh. And the Prophets, for the self same cause, compared them to brute
and unreasonable beasts, as to fed-Horses neighing after their Neighbors
wives, etc. Ier. 5. 8. Psa. 49. 20.
David also in the Psalm. Man being in honor has no understanding, but is
compared to the beasts that perish, etc. Now all these things are done
Figuratively, to note clean and unclean persons as before. For they that have
a true Faith, and a good life, by meditating in the Word, are such as divide
the hoof, and chew the cudde, and they are clean. Such do neither or but the
one, are unclean, as he that believes in GOD, but lives not well, or he
that lives in an outward honesty, but believes nor rightly; he also that
does neither live well nor believe well, all these are unclean. The Jews,
(says this Father) may be said in some sort to chewe the cudde, because they
read the Scriptures, but they divide not the hoof, because they believe not in
the Son of GOD, Christ Jesus, as well as in the Father. To this effect
Irenaeus. Others have by clean beasts parting the hoof, noted the true
Teachers of the Word, which divide the same aright, the Law and the Gospel,
Praecepts and promises, etc.

They again, say others, may be well called clean, dividing the hoof, who
do not believe in great or in gross, but discern and distinguish things, as
Christ, and Moses; Nature and Grace; Truth and falsehood, etc. John 4. 1.
Not believing every spirit but trying the Spirits whether they be of God or
no. Things may not be taken ever literally; And again, we may not be too
bold with Mysteries and Allegories, leaving the letter, but a true wisdom is
to be prayed for, and used in both. He that is 1. Cor. 2. 15.
spiritual (says the Apostle) discerns all things, That, for dividing; and
be wise unto Sobriety, that, for being Romans 12. 3.
too busy in devising Mysteries. For chewing the Cudde, They may be said to
do it, and so to be clean, who meditate of that they hear and learn out of
Gods Book, and often repeating it in their minds, ponder Luke 2. 19.
it in their heart, as is said of the blessed Virgin. A thing much commended in
the Scripture, as in the first Psalm. Blessed is that man that meditateth in
the Law of God day Psalm. 1. 2. Psalm. 19. 14. Genesis 24 63. Deuteronomy. 6. 7.
and night. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be always
acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my Redemer. Isaac went out to
meditate; etc. Commended also by the Fathers: Meditatio Dei dulcis est. To
meditate of God is a sweet thing, Says Saint Augustine. Meditatione pericula
agnoscimus, oratione euadimus. And by meditation, says Saint Bernard, We know
perils, by prayer we avoid them.

2 Your Chapter names many particulars, which Verse. 5.
were but curiosity to stand on. A few may be touched, for example sake. The
Cony was unclean because he cheweth the cudde, and divides not the hoof.
And by this, some have thought, were figured out such men and women, as lay up
their treasures in earth, because the Conies dig and scrape, and make their
berryes in the earth, whereas the Scripture teaches us not to do thus, but to
lay up our treasures in Heaven, where no Math. 6. 19.
thief, no moth, etc. These men and women are unclean, and God will have none
of them.

3 The Hare was also unclean for the same cause, Verse. 6.
because he cheweth the cudde, but divides not the hoof. The Hare is a very
fearful creature, and therefore by him figured out fearful men and women,
despayring of grace and shrinking from God, fearing crosses and losses, and
forsaking Faith. Such persons are unclean, and excluded out of the Kingdom of
GOD. Read Apoc. chap. 21. But the fearful and unbelieving, Revel. 21. 8.
and the abominable, and murderers, and whore-mongers, and forcerers, and
Idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the Lake which burns with
fire and Brimstone, which is the second death.

4 The Swyne was unclean, beause he parts the Verse 7. 8.
hoof, but cheweth not the cudde; and of their flesh they might not eat, nor
touch their carkeise, etc. Tertullian says, Herein was figured such unclean
persons as be good for nothing, but to be slain. For if you consider, what a
creature the Swyne is: He never looks up to Heaven, but has his mouth ever
in the earth and mire, caring for nothing but his belly. He serves not to
ride upon, as does the horse; to till the ground, as does the Ox; to give
milk, as does the Cow; to cloth us with his fleece, as does the Sheep; to
watch by night for us, as does the Dog, and so forth, but he is only
nourished for the knife, and his death has use, his life has none. Such ought
not men and women to be, and if any be such, they are unclean. God would
admonish the Jews by this Figure, and still we may learn by it, to be no
Swyne, no Hog, no filthy myrie creatures wallowing in sin and uncleanness,
without regard and feeling, loving the earth and looking ever on the earth,
rooting in it all the day, and feeding the belly with all greediness,
nourished only to the slaughter, and profiting no way whilst we live. A
profitable meditation for Gods children, that they may so continue, and a
profitable remembrance to others not yet called, that they may become his
children. A good caveat to rich Cormorants in this world, who never profit
any, till they dye, with all the wealth they have. A knife therefore for the
Hog, that we may have Puddings; and death for such Wretches, that the
Commonwealth may have use of their bags.

5 From the Land, Your Chapter comes to the Water, and so from the beasts,
to the Fishes therein; verse. Fishes.
9. showing what was clean, and what unclean, what might be eaten, and what
might not. But Fishes in particular are not named as the beasts were, and the
Fowls afterward are, because the most part was unknown to Jews, having
little use or none of Fish, and few Waters or none but Jordan for Fresh-fish.
Seafish was sold nearer the East, and came not to the Jews much, where they
were. By the marks therefore, God describes them, and says. Whatsoever has
finnes and skales in the Waters, in the Seas, or in the Rivers, them shall ye
Verse 9.
eat. But all that have not, etc: they shall be abomination (...). etc.
unto you. By the sins some have thought was figured Faith; and by the skales
good and honest works. These two, make a clean man or woman acceptable to God.
But he or she, that wants both, or either, is unclean. Faith without
works is not a true Faith, but James 2. 17.
a dead, and beautiful works without Faith, are the blossoms of Hypocrisy,
and please not God.

6 After Land and Water, Moses comes to the Air, Fowls.
and shows what Fowls therein are clean and unclean. Verse 13.
Wherein you may note the great mercy of God, in that most of these unclean
Fowls are indeed odious to our Nature and we eat them not, whereas he might
have restrained them from those, that they loved and liked. So good is he in
all things, and careful not to The Sea^ew. The Swanne. The Heron. The Lapwing
lay heavy burdens upon us. Some good Fowls are yet restrained, that man
might learn Temperance and Obedience. For Gluttony and Excess, we are very
prone unto. Some have considered the nature of every Foul, and labored to
learn somewhat for amendment, but it is good to be sober in these things: As
for example, by the Eagle which flies high, they have noted mounting minds to
be a fault, and to make men unclean, as indeed they doc, howsoever the
meaning was thu^, to teach, by making the Eagle unclean. By the Goshauke, men
that prey upon their weaker brethren and neighbors, and gripe them so as they
kill them, or undo the^. By the Vulture, men that delight too much in Wars
Verse 14.
and contention. By the Kyte, cowardly-men, that yet are deuourers as they can.
By the Ravens, unnatural Parents, Verse 15.
that forsake their children; Unkind Friends which shrink away; Ill Husbands
which provide not for their Families, etc. By the Ostrich, painted Hypocrites,
and verse 16.
carnal men, that have fair great feathers but cannot fly, etc. By the
little Owl, and the great Owl, such as verse 17.
love darkness, and fly the light, such also as are unsociable with men, and
love solitarines too much. By the Sea-mew (which lives both on Land and Water)
such as will be saved both by Faith and works, partly by the one, and partly
by the other, etc. Such Ambodexters also as the world has store of, holding
with the Hare and running with the Hound; Fire in the one hand and water in the
other; Two faces under a Hood, etc. By the Hawke, such as are kept for others
harm, whereof also there are too many. We must have an Oliver for a Rouland,
and so we maintain such as the earth is weary of, and their wickedness shall be
our destruction, if not of our whole house and posterity. By the Cormorant,
all greedy covetous persons, etc. By the Lapwyng, you Verse 19.
may take occasion to remember what the Poet says, which is thus.

TEREUS King of Thracia, married Progne daughter of Pandion; which Progne having
a sister called Philomela, Ovid. Metamor: Fab. Septima.
after certain years, desired her husband, that either she might go to her
sister to see her, or have her sister fetched unto her. The King willingly
yielded, He would fetch her sister to her, and to that end went to sea, came to
her Father and his Father in-law, obtained leave for her, to go with him for
awhile to her sister. But see, as they were in their journey, his unclean
heart burned in lust toward Philomela his wives sister, and by force abused
her, cutting out her tongue after, that she might not tell. Thus dumb and
speachles he brought her home to her sister, who amazed at this change in her,
and not knowing more then her husband the King would tell her, in stead of joy,
had great sorrow in her self, no way now able to talk with her sister, and
to have any comfort in her. But Philomela getting an needle and silk,
expressed thereby as by writing, how her husband had abused her body, and cut
out her tongue, as he brought her to see her. Then Progne all enraged with
fury and wrath, casting which way to be revenged of him for this odious fact,
caught at last her little son by him, and slew him crying upon her, Mother,
Mother, and clasping about her neck with kisses as long as he could, making
meat of him for the King his father. The King liking the meat well, called
for the little child, that he might have some of it, when she with a fierce
look told him, he had his child in his bellye for the good he had done to her
sister, and with that showed him the head, flinging forth from him as fast as
she could, he so astonished that he could not tell what he did. Then (says
the Poet) they were all three, to avoid further mischief, suddenly changed
into three Fowls: Progne, this cruel Mother, into a Swallowe, who caryeth red
upon his breast, to note the bloodinesse of her breast; Philomela her sister,
into a Nightingale, who keeps in the woods, as ashamed of the villainy done
to her by the King, and lamenteth it in the Night by her sorrowful song. The
wicked King, who was cause of all, into a Lapwyng, which is delighted with
dounge and filth to note his foul and filthy mind to his sister in-law, has
a long bill wherewith he strikes and hurts other Birds, noting his cruel
knife, that cut out his sisters tongue, feathers upon the head like a crown,
noting his place and dignity that he was a King, whereupon the Verses were
made.

Rex fueram, sic crista probat, sed sordidavita,
Immundam e tanto culmine fecit auem.
The Lapwyng then, may shadow out all foul unclean minds, full of cruelty
and lust, full of cruelty also to work the concealment of lust, as you see in
David, 2. Sam. 11.
first lusting, and then killing. But thus to follow Allegories I forbear,
only noting thus much, to show you Learned men's applications of these things
for our good. And surely, although I dare not say, that by these unclean birds
and beasts thus much was meant, yet thus much is most certain, that whosoever have
these qualities noted in the nature of them, they are as certainly unclean to
God, as these birds were for use of meat to this people. Let us ever therefore
abhor such spots, that we be clean to the Lord who is cleanenesse it self.

8 Some thing is spoken in your Chapter, of creeping things, whereby men have
noted the uncleanness shadowed of such as mind earthly things too much, and
particularly by the Weasel, deceitful persons, because the Weasell is
deceitful and crafty. By the Mouse, such as live upon others labors and are
unprofitable themselves. By the Want, or Mole, such as are blind and ignorant.

Lastly, that which is spoken of uncleanness, growing by the touch of these
things, and that which you read Verse. 2. 4. etc.
of washing and breaking earthen Vessels, you must ever take it so, that God
stood not so much upon these Ceremonies, as to teach his People hereby inward
truth, and cleanenesse of heart, ever fit for such as belong to him, and
without which none can be accepted of him. At this therefore (as I said) we
must carefully aim, that we may be holy, as our heavenly Father is holy. And
among all uncleanness, beware of that which is noted verse 27.
by such things, as go upon their paws, Namely, to profess the Gospel for
lucre-sake. For where that is the cause, the effect will fail with the cause,
and whilst it continues and fails not, yet is it hateful to GOD for his
ground. The Gospel must be loved to gain Heaven, and not to purchase the
earth by it, further than GOD shall please to cast it as an adjacent by his
promise. Seek first the Kingdom of Matthew. 6. 33.
GOD, and the Righteousuesse thereof, and all these (...). Sa. 17. 39. Mat. 14.
29. 30 Amas Deum? ambulas super mare; amas seculum? absorbebit te. etc. Aug. de
verb. Domini: ^erm. 13.
things shall be cast unto you. Saul his Armor was not fit for David, neither
could he march well against Goliath, till he had put it off; no more shall men
clogged with earthly cares, courageously and effectually go against Satan that
proud Philistim, that would destroy them. Peter walked above the water; and
Peter began to sink under the Water. Whilst thou love GOD unfeignedly, thou
walk; and when thou love the Vna haec placida, solida, firma, and perpetua
securitas, si quid in rebus humanis sublime and magnum videtur, oculis ad

Donat.
world thou sinkest. Love not the world therefore, neither the things that are
in the world, etc: says Saint John, 1. Epist. Chap. 2. verse 15. For it
flattereth us to deceive us, it allureth us to slay us, and it lifts us up,
that it may throw us down with a greater fall. But meditate further with your
self, what inconstancy in earthly things you have ^eene, and let this suffice
of this Chapter.

CHAP. XII.
IN this Chapter is contained the manner of VVomens purifying in those days
after Childbirth. A thing not to be forced upon us in manner and form as it
then was used, no more than other the Ceremonial Laws of Moses. Yet is the
Law and honesty of nature, still and ever to be observed amongst all people.
And forasmuch as in the Gospel, there is mention made of the Blessed Luke 2.
22.
Virgins Purifying, let us breefly consider this custom, and labor to draw
fit profit from it to our selves.

1 Moses is willed to speak unto the Children of Israel, verse. 1. 2.
that is, to the men, that when a Woman has brought forth seed, etc. Why
should the Law for Women, be published and given to the men, and not rather to
the women themselves? Surely, to the end that men might join also with the
women, in a care to see it observed and kept according to the Commandment. As
the Laws of Kings and Princes, which belong to Laborers, are given to Lords
to see them executed and performed. Let Men note, what trust God reposeth in
Note.
them, to see that their wives keep his Laws and Ordinances, and let them
never be unfaithful to one of such love toward them to trust them, and of
such power to punish their breach of trust. Let Women note it, to move their
hearts to think both of their Husbands charge, and their duty. They may not
break a Ceremony, but their Husbands shall be shent for it, much less the
substance of all Religion and obedience to God. What a happy grace then, for
both to join together, and either to strive to excel other in careful
keeping of God his Laws?

2 By this Ceremony of Purification, the Jews (and in them all men) were put
in mind of their natural corruption, and led (as it were by the hand) to the
remedy against the same, Christ Jesus. Of the former, plainly speaks David
in his Psalm, when he says, Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, and in sin
has my Psalm. 51. 5.
Mother conceived me. Before our birth, and in our birth we are unclean, and
from our uncleanness our mothers also become unclean. Which very plainly and
truly confuteth that gross error of Pelagius, denying the propagation of
sin from Parents to children, and Imitatione, non Origin.
affirming that by Imitation only, and not originally we became evil. But if
the birth were clean, the mother by the birth should not become unclean, as
this Ceremony of Purifying did shadow that she was. God would therefore have
all men know what they are by Nature and inheritance from their Parents, and
what by grace through the remedy provided, Christ our only 1. John 1. 8.
righteousness and purity. Also that God had rather have them never enter
into the Church, than to enter with corruption vnsorrowed for, and vncared for.

3 But why then was the Virgin Marie purified, since the Child she bare had
no uncleanness or corruption in him, being neither conceived nor borne in
sin, but the immaculate Lamb, and the Son of God? The Answer is, that
although Christ in himself was not (...) 1. 19.
only pure, but even purity it self, and the Virgin Marie his Mother was not
indeed properly and directly subject to this Law, because she conceived not
by man's seed, of which the Law was meant, and Christ Matthew. 12. 8.
was Lord of the Law; Yet forasmuch as it pleased him to take upon him the
person of all mankind which was corrupt and sinful, so, and in that respect
both he and the Blessed Virgin became obedient to the Law. He, (says the
Apostle) that he might redeem us from the curse of Gal. 4. 5.
the Law, who were indeed subject to it, as also, by this his voluntary
submission to it, He might take away, abrogate and give an end to this
Ceremony, so that now it is not needful to present any children in the Temple
with an Offering as then was used, but all purity and cleanenes is to be
sought for in Christ Jesus himself only, the body and truth of all these
Figures and shadows Col. 2. 17.
in the Law.

4 A Question again may be asked, why the time Verse. 5.
of Purification was doubled in a woman-childe, to that it was in a man-child?
And Answer is made by some, that it was in respect of a natural cause in the
body, which I leave. Others, because in women there is more vice and evil than
in man: A hard judgment and without any Warrant, for who knows what is in
either but only God, I mean, the greatness and full measure of evil? Thirdly
therefore it is answered, and with more probability, that it was, because the
woman was the beginning of our fall, deceiving her 1. Tim. 2. 14.
husband when she was deceived her-selfe, and so drawing all her posterity
into the like fall and ruin with her. But the last Answer and best (as I
think) is, because a man-child was circumcised, and not the woman, therefore
the punishment of being unclean was lessned in the Male, and doubled in the
Female.

5 The Difference of Offering allowed to the poorer Verse 8.
sort, very comfortably shows the gracious care God has of our poverty and
mean estate, as also how little he passes for any of our pomp and riches,
accepting as well of two Turtles, or two young Pigeons as of a Lamb, when
ability serves not to bring a Lamb. Let the due meditation hereof raise up
our hearts if we be poor, and pull down our stomachs if we be rich: for
the matter accepted with God, is not glory and Pomp, but a true heart fearing
to do evil, and hungring to do well, resting in Christ, and in nothing else,
as the true medicine for all our sores, and most pleasing Sacrifice for all our
sins. Riches are comfortable if God give them and grace with them, but
poverty is no misery when we fear God.

6 Lastly, concerning the use with us, we must well consider, that although
this Ceremonial Law of Moses be abrogated and gone, yet honesty of Nature,
and modesty in women-kinde is neither abrogated nor gone. Therefore, even
still we retain in our Church, a lawful and laudable custom among women,
that they shall rest a time after childbirth, to gather strength again in
their houses, without coming abroad, and when God shall enable them to endure
the Air, then to come to Church, accompayned with their loving friends and
neigbours, there thankfully to acknowledge Gods great mercy to them, in both
giving them safe deliverance, and blessing them with fruit of their bodies to
their comfort. But see the difference of the Mosaicall Law, and this our
Custom. There the woman was put apart by God, and so continued unclean Forty
days upon a man-child, and double upon a Maid; With us neither by God nor man
is she put aside for any time certain, but as the Lord shall give strength
sooner or longer she is at her libetry, yet ever observing womanly modesty, as
is most fit. There, she was to touch no holy thing, neither to come into the
Sanctuary, til that time was out: with us, she may touch any thing, and come
to the Sanctuary when she will, with respect above said: There, was a
difference betwixt a man-child and a maid, with us, none, but both alike:
There, was a Burnt-Offering, and a Sinne-Offering; with us, neither the one,
nor the other: There, an Atonement was made for her, with us, no such thing.
Lastly, there, she was unclean till all were ended, with us, never unclean,
at all, And do we then retain still a Jewish Purifying? Far be from us
both untrue speech and false judgment. Our custom, you see, differs greatly
from This Jewish Ceremony, and is nothing but a needful thing in regard of
weakness, a modest Ceremony in regard of womanhood, and a Christian duty in
regard of mercy and comfort received, to come to the Church, and to give him
thanks most humbly and heartily, that has dealt so kindly and mercifully with
us. Let us therefore love to be obedient to good things, hate to be
contentious and troublesome in a peaceable Church, and let modesty ever make
us esteem better of our Governors than of our selves. There was never the
thing since the world was made, which an evil heart and a lawless tongue may
not carpe at, but the Apostles words must rule the Apostles Scholars, We 1.
Cor. 11. 16.
have no such custom, neither the Church of GOD. Women in Women's matters may
have authority to discern what is fit, and why should any immodest mind
meddle with them, so much as to raise stirs, and break peace in things
established by Law, by honesty, by modesty, by long continuance, and all good
approbation? I trust what is past is dead, and will never revive again. God
make us thankful for our Government and Laws, and for the happy peace both of
Church and Commonwealth, and let us never be the breakers of it. Amen, Amen.
And so no more of this Chapter.

CHAP. XIII.
IN this Chapter, you have an other kind of uncleanness spoken of, namely the
Leprosy, a disease very fearful and ugly. Whereof three sorts The sum of
the Chapter.
are named, to wit, Of the body; of the Garments; and of the house; for all
these might be infected and unclean. And learned men are of opinion, that
after some special and peculiar manner unknown this day to us, the Jews were
troubled and afflicted with this disease. For profit and use to us, when we
read these things (which is all my drift) thus we may better our selves and
gather good. First, let us mark who were appointed Judges hereof to tell when
any man was infected with this malady, surely not all the Levites, but Aaron
only and his Sons, who were Priests. By which, our popish Teachers would
gather an argument for their Verse 1:
auricular confession, and ea^e shrift, that as these Priests were made Judges
of this contagion of body by viewing and looking on it, so they should be
Judges of the Leprosy of the soul by hearing confessions of men and women,
and judging of the qualities of their several sins. But alas, it hangs
together as the sand does, the one having express warrant, and the other none.
And if it were good to gather arguments in this sort, we might rather conclude
the contrary, that forasmuch as Aaron and his Sons were not made Judges of
any secret matter, but only when it was broken out into plain appearance of a
swelling in the skin, of a scabbe, or a white spot etc. Therefore, neither
must these Romish Verse 2.
Masters meddle with hidden and secret things as they do, but only with
matters public, and publicly. Let this idle collection therefore of theirs
go, and we truly and rightly learn by this, that herein was figured, not
that Romish Priesthood, but the pure and holy Priesthood of our blessed
Savior, who does see and know, handle and touch, regard and heal all our
spiritual spots, as these Priests here dealt with this bodily infection. So
that, if we be unclean, we cannot deceive him, but full well He sees and
knows us to be so, He judging us so, puts us apart for such, and till
sorrow sinking into our hearts for the same we repent and take hold of him by
Faith, that we may be healed by him, we never recover any health; and when we
do, then are we cured, and so pronounced by him to our eternal joy and
comfort. Away therefore with our fig leaves, for they cannot cover us, if I
be a swearer, an unclean liver, a drunkard, an envious person, a slaunderer,
or such like, I am a Leper, a spiritual Leper, and Christ is Judge whom I
cannot mock, he will never say I am clean, till indeed I be so, and so
without amendment of life, I must out of the host, that is, out of the Church
and number of his chosen, to die for ever in my impuritie. Think, think of it
while you have time.

2 When you read in the fourth verse, of shutting up the Verse. 4. 5.
party for seven days, and then to look on it again, you may note with your
self, how greatly God hates hasty, rash, and uncharitable judgment. A thing,
which many men and women otherwise honest and good, are carried away withal,
to their own great hurt, not only in soul, but in worldly reputation also,
and to the bitter and biting discomfort of those whom they ought to love and
judge well of. Nay, you may reason further with your self thus, that if in a
matter thus subject to the eye, as these sores were, yet God would have no
have, but a stay for seven days, and longer as occasion served, before any
judgment should be given that the party was unclean. O how much more does
he abhor have, and love leisure, in pronouncing of the hearts and thoughts of
our friends and neighbors, which are not seen, nor subject to an easy
censure? Be admonished therefore and bettered by this, as long as you live, in
this matter, and you shall much please both God and man. The more to strengthen
you in this course, often remember what holy Fathers and virtuous men have done
in their times. What does Peace (says S. Augustine) in Aug. in Psa. 147.
this pilgrimage of our mortality, wherein no man's heart can be known or
discerned what it is? I will tell you (says he) what it does. It judges not
of uncertain things, it confirms not unknown matters. It is more prone and
ready to believe well of a man, than to suspect evil. It greeueth not much if
happily sometimes it err by thinking well of one that deserves it not, but it
fears much to err in thinking ill of one that deserves well. What loose I,
if I judge one good, when it is uncertain Quid perdo, si credo quia bonus est,
si incertum est, vtrum sit malus?
that he is ill? Although thou beware, for fear it be true, yet thou may not
condemn him, as if it were true. This Peace requires, and follow peace and
ensue it etc. S. Bernard again notably. Beware ever to be a curious scanner of
other men's lives, or a rash judge although thou see somewhat amiss, but rather
excuse his meaning, if thou Dicito apud reipsum, vehemens fuit tentatio, quid
de me illa fecisset si accipisset in me similem potestatem. Bernard. Notaui
luctum, nec vllum in eo detractionis aut condemnationis vestigium inueni.
can not defend his act, as that he did it ignorantly etc. And if the matter
admit no excuse, then say to thy self in thy heart, o it was a vehement and
strong temptation, and what would it have wrought in me, if it had assailed me,
as it did him? Again, there are none so ready to judge others as they that
never judge themselves. But could that veyle be removed from their eyes, and
they made to see themselves, though they could live an hundred years, and the
flood Jordan be turned into tears flowing from their eyes, they would think
all too little to bewail their own spots, and never busy themselves with
other men's. I have noted sorrow, and I never saw so much as a step of
detraction or condemnation of others in it etc. Again, as only pride is
enough to condemn a man without any other vice with it, so is this sin of
judging. For by this the Pharisie Luke 18. 11. Bern. Clim. grad.
was condemned. A wise gatherer of grapes gathers but the ripe and good
grapes, and medleth not with the sour and ill grapes, and even a good man or
woman notes men's virtues and speaks of them, when a fool will be meddling
with their imperfections. Saint Chrysostom, Chrysostom. in Matthew.
follows also this way, and has these words; As it is hard for one that is
good himself, to judge another to be naught: so it is again, as hard for one
that is naught himself, to judge another to be good. Every man by himself
will judge of others. The Fornicator thinks no man chaste, but the chaste-man
so easily suspecteth not the Fornicator. The proud man thinks none to be
humble, but the humble man thinks none to be proud. It was Aesops speech,
that every one has a wallet on his shoulder, and into the end that hangs
before him, puts other men's actions, but his own ever into the end behind
him and out of his sight. It was Tullie his speech, that as every one is good
himself, so Cic. ad Q. fratrem. Vt quisque est vir optimus, ita difficilim^
esse alios improbos suspicatur. 1. Chro. 19.
he hardly conceiueth others to be evil. And contrariwise, how hardly evil
persons do think well of others, consider in them that could not believe that
David sent his Messengers in love and kindness as he did, but rather as spies
to some evil purpose, and thereupon they abused them as they did, by shauing
their beards and cutting their clothes. Which lewd suspicion turned to the
overthrow of them and theirs, yea, of the whole kingdom, that by such a
punishment we might ever learn to hate such a vice, as false suspicion is. You
see now the practice and doctrine of the wise, let it move you, let it smite
you, let it better you till your death.

3 In the 7. verse, you have an example how one Verse 7,
quit and pronounced clean, may yet be viewed after again, and be found
unclean, which may thus profit you, to make you remember two judgments, the
one of Man, the other of God. By the former, we may be cleared, and by the
later we may be condemned. Therefore ever look how all is in his eyes that
knows all, and make peace with him by true repentance and amendment of life,
little ioying in Man's judgment who takes me for a Saint, if this righteous
Judge of all Judges know me for a Devil. Let us search and try our ways,
(says the Prophet Jeremy) and turn again to Ier. Lament. 3. 40. 41.
the Lord, let us lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens,
etc.

4 When the Leprosy brake out and covered all his Verse. 13. etc.
flesh, the Priest pronounced him clean, and not to be put apart, because
says your Marginall Note, this was not that contagious Leprosy which
infected, but a kind of skirf which had not the flesh raw as the Leprosy had.
This diversity of sores may put us in mind of the diversity of sins, and
punishments to be imposed upon men for them. And make us more wise in
chastising others, and patient when we are corrected our selves, the
punishment being fitted to the fault. But most notably it may strike us with a
thankful consideration of that mercy, that among this diversity of sores,
lays neither one nor other upon us, but grants health and freedom from
all. The Lord of his goodness make us ever thankful for our selves and ours,
and continue this favor to us.

5 The Leaper also, says your Chapter, in whom the Verse. 45.
plague is, was to have his clothes rent, (in sign of sorrow and lamentation)
and his head bare, and must put a covering He dwelt alone out of the tents,
and if he were a Priest he did eat no more of the holy things. Chap. 22.
upon his lips, (either in token of mourning, or for fear of infecting
others) and should cry, I am unclean, I am unclean. So careful was God, to
have unclean persons known and discerned from others in those days. And we
may take occasion to wish, that with us also in these days, all bold and
presumtuous mislyuers, being most unclean before God and al good men, were
distinguished from them that hate their wickedness, by some such open marks
as these were, to the end that others might both avoid them, and they
themselves be stricken with some shame to amendment of life and saving of
their souls. In former times harlots had obscure and remote places to dwell
in, and by their habitation they were discerned, but now it is to be feared,
both in dwelling, in apparel, and other things they compare with, and far
exceed to, those whose shooee they are not worthy to bear. But yet God
knows them, and ^ee is just if they amend not. No gaudie gallants can deceive
him, but his eyes pierce through all Maskes and colors whatsoever.
Allegorically, some have said these things in the Leaper shadowed the state
and case of all wicked men and women. As the rent clothes, that they are vile
and odious before God; his bare-head, that in Christ their head they have no
portion, but are deprived of him; his lips or mouth covered, that such
graceless persons cannot open their mouths before God in any prayer to be
heard; his shutting out of the Camp, that such are to be excommunicate from
the number of the faithful, and are deprived of the heavenly inheritance, etc.
See more the 22. Chapter.

6 In the 47. ver. you read of the Leprosy of garments Verse 47, etc.
etc. Which kind of contagion and infection, the Lord in his infinite mercy
has made us ignorant of. The washing commanded here of such garments
admonished them, and in them still us, that our duty is to abstain from all
uncleanness, and to purge our selves from all pollution both of body and
spirit. If garments may have such things laid upon them by God, how much more
our flesh and our bodies, and therefore again think with all thankful
thoughts of the blessing of health, and of the means vouchsafed of God for
health, as Prayer, Physicians, Chirurgions, Herbs, and Medicines many, whereof
the wise Syrach speaks in his 38. Chap. read it often and with feeling. One
Ecclus. 38.
sight of your face in a glass as the Lord could smite it in a moment, would
make you feel and see what God does for you in giving health and freedom from
such strange sores, etc.

7 Much more might be noted in this Chapter, but it is fitter for Physicians,
and therefore I pass it over. Only I will remember a Question moved, whether
for any such fearful infections a man and wife may be divorced, and leaving
all large discourse, which they that are fit may have in many Writers, I
answer breefly, that more causes of divorce than we read in Scripture, we
may not presume to make, and that is, but in the case of Adulterye. This
excepted, the Rule, stands firm, Whom God has joined together, let no Mat.
19. 6.
man put asunder. Secondly, it were a kind of bitter cruelty to add such
affliction to the afflicted so sore already, as to take husband from wife, or
wife from husband, who mutually should comfort each other in all extremites and
crossing woes of this changing world, and with that condition have been joined
and plighted their troth one to the other, that in sickness as well as health,
they would cleave together forsaking all others till the death of one of them.
But then again on the other side, as cruel and inconvenient it were, to bind
the party clean, to company and due benevolence with the infected. For this
were evident danger to the clean, and to the seed that should come of them in
that case, and so consequently to the Commonwealth also, by the spreading of
such a fearful malady in it. Wherefore the middle-way is best for all
parties, Namely, that the knot of Marriage remain unbroken, and the party
clean perform all Offices of help and comfort to the unclean, saving
conjunction of bodies, that the party infected see how he is called of God
unto Chastity during this case of his, and therefore by Diet, by Watching, and
Prayer, and all good means, endeavor to keep his body under from such
desires, laying his sins to his heart, for which this and much more is due
unto him, (although happily imposed upon him, not for his sin, but for his
trial and the glory of God) and yet taking a true and comfortable hold upon
his God, whose mercy has neither bottom nor measure, and who has promised
most graciously that he will never lay more upon any child of his than he
shall 1. Cor. 10. 19.
be able to bear, but will give an issue to the temptation and trial that he
may bear it. Thus God has his time to heal as well as to stricke, to comfort
as well as to afflict, and to wipe all tears away as well as to cause them any
way. Look up then to him and ever trust in him. Say with Job, in a holy
cheerfulness, If the Lord Job 13. 15. 1. Sam. 3. 18.
shall kill me, I will not shrink from him. With Heli, and David, It is he,
it is he, let him do his good pleasure. His correction has an end, but his
love shall never have an end, if I submit my self and be patient. Let
friends also be full of comfort to such a one, and not by the least look,
word, or action add grief unto grief. God will see it and reward it.

CHAP. XIIII.
NOw, that it is most true, God has a The sum of the Chapter.
time to heal as well as to strike, and to comfort as well as to grieve, behold
your self in this Chapter, where you shall read, that many thus afflicted,
were in God his goodness healed again, and restored both to their houses in
the host, and their places in the Tabernacle, as sound as ever they were. The
Ceremonies of this restitution are here also appointed both to the one place
and the other, whereof let us labor to make some good use to our selves.

1 He was brought unto the Priest, as to him that Verse 2.
must judge whether he was clean or no, and why the Priest was so appointed
to be Judge, you had the reason in the beginning of the former Chapter. But
where must he be brought unto the Priest? into the Camp and Congregation
where the Priest was? No, but the Priest, says the Text, shall go out of the
Camp, and consider him. So is it still the duty of all faithful Ministers to
go to the sick, to see them and consider their estate toward God, ministering
comfort to them in due season, whilst their hearing is good, their
understanding good, and their memory good. For when these things are decayed,
we labor often to little purpose. And would God both they that are sick had
more care often to send for their Ministers to them in due time, and the
Ministers when they know it, to go, and with all care and diligence to labor
with them whilst time serves. For it is too late for both parties, when Death
has stricken his struck.

2 If the Priest thus coming to him, found him clean, then did he so
pronounce him to be and appoint him to offer his gift, etc. But except he
were clean, the Priest durst not pronounce him clean. Thus remained the glory
of his health to God that had given it, and to the Church the use of the
Ministry both for order and comfort. See herein the manner of our Absolution
retained in the true Church of Christ, and practiced. We do not heal the
sinner from his spiritual disease of soul by forgiving his sin, as the
Priest here healed not the real disease of the body by making him sound, but
when we see hearty repentance and a lively faith in the promises of God made
to penitent sinners for Christ, then we pronounce him according to our Warrant
to be forgiven, even as the Priest did here him that indeed by Gods mercy to
him was now healed of his Leprosy. So have we the Ministry of
reconciliation committed unto us for the comfort of the penitent, but challenge
not the power to forgive, which belongs to God only, as that man of sin
does, who in his blasphemous Pardons takes upon him to forgive both Paenam
and Culpam, the punishment and the sin. In regard then of this order and use
of the Ministry it was, that Christ bad the Leper whom he had Matthew. 8. 4.
cleansed go show himself to the Priest, because till the Priest upon view
said he was clean he might not be admitted into the Congregation. The Fathers
allege other causes which also may stand with this, and with profit be
observed, as for that he would have all honor preserved to the Priests that
God had bestowed on them, and himself be no example of taking any jot away.
Now to be Judge was an honor, and therefore Hierom, in Matthew. Tertul. lib. 4:
con. Marcion.
he will have it preserved. That thus the Priests might be drawn to believe
on him and so to be saved, or else to be made inexcusable for their contempt;
That he might not seem a breaker of the Law, as often he was accused to be;
That he might be thankful to God who had so mercifully healed; a thing often
promised in sickeneste, but seldom performed after recovery, etc. Vt doceret
ciuiles and legitimas rerumpub. ordinationes in vnaquaque politia obseruandas
esse, seque non venisse vt eas abrogaret, cum regnum eius nonsit de hoc Mundo.
That he Chrysoft. hom. 26. operis imperfecti in Mat.
might teach the duty of men to observe civil and lawful ordinances in every
Commonwealth, and that he was not come to break them, seeing his kingdom is
not of this world.

3 For Ceremony further there must be taken for him Verse 4.
that was cleansed two sparrowes alive (or little birds) clean, that is such
as were permitted to be eaten, and Ceder wood, and a skarlet lace and Hyssope.
And the Priest Verse (...).
should command to kill one of the birds over pure water in an earthen
vessel. After he must take the live sparrow Verse 6.
with the Cedar-wood, and the skarlet lace, and the Hyssope, and must dip them
and the living sparrow in the blood of the sparow slain over the pure water,
And he Verse. 7.
must sprinkle upon him that was cleansed of his Leprosy, seven times, and
cleanse him, and then let go the live sparow into the broad field, etc.
Eusebius Emissenus in one of his Homelies says, these things might seem
light, if they had not been appointed by him whose least commandment is not
light. By the two sparrowes therefore (says he) the cleansed person might be
put in mind, Theodoret. ad duas in Christo moriente naturas accommodat.
Dialog. 3.
to offer unto God both soul and body a living sacrifice no more to serve the
world and the pleasures of this life, but the God of goodness and mercy that
had cleansed him from so great and greiuous a malady. The Cedar-wood being a
wood that will not easily corrupt, and that has also a good and pleasing smell
might shadow out unto him also a holy life, sweet manners, and incorrupt
actions how pleasing to God, how fit for him that thus was cleansed. The skarlet
lace being red and of the color of fire might tell him how due from him were
hot thoughts of hearty thankfulness from a burning heart to God, and true
love and charity to all his neighbors. The Hyssope growing usually in the
rock, how rooted he ought to be in Christ the son of God the true Rock. The
sparrow slain might teach him the necessity of mortification in the body
which in deed is an earthen vessel, the killing of it over pure water, that
nothing more works this mortification than pure water of Gods word contained
in the Scriptures. The living sparrow letten fly abroad, might shadow the
soul living unto righteousness through the grace of God, and set at liberty
to mount aloft when the body is dead. Thus Eufebius too curiously and nicely
skanneth these things. But having noted therein the fancies of men otherwise
grave, and wise and learned, I hold it better that we gather but thus much,
that by the blood of Christ we are truly cleansed and set at liberty, not
otherwise: as here the live sparrow dipped in the blood of the slain sparow
is set free. The seauenfold sprinkling might happily shadow an earnest and
continued meditation of Gods goodness to him that thus was comforted, and not
for a bay or two, and then no more. Surely our thoughts of his mercy
vouchsafed to us are ever too short and transitory, and therefore seven
sprinklings are little enough to teach us our duty herein, God for his mercy
so sprinkle us over and over, that we may ever remember his kind goodness
toward us a thousand ways: Saying with the thanfull Prophet to our selves and
souls often, Praise the Psalm. 103. 2.
Lord O my soul, and forget not, forget not all his benefits: his infinite
benefits, his sweet benefits, his most vnderserued benefits on our parts. The
Shauing and Verse 8. etc.
washing mentioned also, shadowed truly unto him his new life, in the
obedience of GOD, as well as his perfect and full curing from the Leprosy. The
care that GOD has still of the poor in allowing Verse 21.
a difference of Offering for them, is still to be noted how often so-euer it
comes, that we may see his goodness and be soundly rooted in our hope in
him, Verse 10.
be we never so poor. The Oil, as before in this Book has been noted,
shadowed the holy spirit of God purchased for us and to us by Christ, and the
anointing of his right care and thumb etc, That our verse. 14.
ear ought to hear, and all our might perform the blessed Will of him that
cleanses us from our soul diseases.

4 Now having thus spoken of the Ceremonies of clensing men and women, he
comes in the 34. verse. 34.
verse to speak of clensing of leprous houses. Where remember again, that
this kind of leprosy is unknown unto us, and God make us thankful for it.
But when it was, and where it was, the Text says, God sent it, and it well
shows, that even the well being of our Verse 34.
houses is a mercy and not a little one, although we too little think of it.
And if the walls of stone or timber may be thus smitten with such a disease, O
what can he do with these bodies of ours! these pampred and dainty bodies of
ours, upon which we spend all our care and cost, never thinking on the soul,
till it be too late, I say what, what can God lay upon them in the twinkling
of an eye if he be angry and turn the comfort of his face from us? wherefore
meditate of his mercy in giving health both to body and house, and let it
never be unthought upon, some-time at least every day. The marks whereby this
Leprosy was discerned of the Priest you have in the Text, deep spots greenish
verse. 37.
or reddish which seem to belower than the wall. Also how the Priest might not
rashly condemn the house, but must shut it up a time and then look upon it
again, and yet we can hastily and rashly condemn our brethren, our equals, our
betters, that they are thus and so. There was an easier clensing by scraping
and changing the infected stones, and a harder clensing by quite pulling it
down. God gently deals with sinners if it may serve, and quite ouer-throweth
the incurable. The expiation shows we ought to have clean houses, and the
Offering notes from whom all health is, even from God.

CHAP. XV.
SOme other uncleanness incident to man and woman is mentioned in this Chapter,
whereof modestly you may think as you read it. Unto the 9. verse he speaks
of man, and then verse 19. of the woman. For use unto your self first consider
by occasion of these things that original corruption which is gotten into our
nature by the fall of our first Parents, through which we are most unclean
many ways in the eyes of God. The Lord has a great care to work this
meditation in us strongly, when he so amplifieth these natural vncleanesses in
us, as that every thing is made unclean which touches him in that case. Every
bed whereon he lies, every thing whereon he sits, whosoever touches the
bed shall wash his clothes, etc. He that sits upon the seat where he sat,
The saddle that he rides on, yea, the vessel that he touches, and so
forth. So also of the woman in the latter part of the Chapter, modestly read
and be edified. Think of the Scriptures that note this corruption in us,
telling us that all the imaginations of the thoughts Genesis 6. 5.
of our hearts are only evil continually: That in us, that Romans 7. 18.
is, in our flesh dwells no good thing: For to will is present Romans 8. 5.
with some (as with the Apostle that spoke it, and yet he found no means to
perform that which is good.) For he could not do the good which he would,
but the evil that he would not that did he. And so forth, as follows in
that Chapter most notably. That they which are 1. Cor. 2. 14.
in the flesh, savor the things of the flesh. That the natural man perceives
not the things which are of God, but Deuteronomy. 29. 4. Ephesians 4. 18. Chap. 5. 8. Romans
3. Psalm. 19.
they are foolishness to him, etc. Think what particular parts of us are
charged with this corruption, and see if they be not the very chiefest, as the
understanding, the will, the heart, the eyes, the ears, and so forth. Be
moved with it, and renouncing your self, seek for remedy where it only is,
and not in your self. Follow the Counsel of the Apostle and take his words
as an explication of the end of this Ceremony, Namely, that we endeavor to
2. Cor. 7. 1.
cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh, and Spirit, and that we
finish our Sanctification in the fear of GOD. To this end the Lord has
ordained holy Matrimony, and taught that it is honorable among all men. To
this end he has forbidden all unclean lusts, and taught us that Whoremongers
and Adulterers he will judge. For this is the Will of GOD, (says the Apostle)
Even your sanctification, and that ye should abstain from Fornication; That
every one should know 1. These. 4. 3.
to possess his vessel in holiness and honor, And not in 4. 5.
the lust of concupiscence, as the Gentiles which know not God. And, blessed
are the clean in heart (says our Savior Christ) for they shall see God.
Strengthen your Matthew. 5. 8.
self therefore in this holy course by these Scriptures and the like. Consider
often the Commandment of God, in whose hand is death if you disobey. Consider
his nature that he is purity and cleanenes it self, and as he is our
heavenly Father, so should we be his children and servants. Consider how it
is impossible to pray to him aright with an unclean mind for any want we
have. Consider what hope we can have of eternal life, if we love uncleanness,
when the Rule is thus, Follow holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord. Consider the hurt of example. The danger that grows to a Commonwealth
when for such filthiness the Lord often Hebre. 12. 14.
ouer-throweth a whole state, as the licentious life of one Paris did Troy. And
finally, think what ugly diseases and maladies, what rotting and burning, what
shame and confusion the Lord lays even in this life upon unclean persons,
besides the fearful fall etern^ll that is assured afterward when this life is
ended. Meditate I say of these things, and pray continually for grace and
strength. Say with the good old Father when any wicked motion peepeth up. O
Lord help, O Lord O Domine, vim patior, succurre, succurre. etc.
strengthen, for I suffer violence, and am assaulted, etc.

2 In the washing here mentioned and in the Atonement, note the mercy of God
toward all miserable sinners, and see with comfort, that although the fall of
our first Parents has thus blotted us and spotted us, that indeed we are most
unclean; yet ought we not to despair, but take hold of him by a lively
Faith, Who Ezech. 18.
will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should repent and live,
disliking himself for his manifold sins, and cleaning to his God for his
manifold mercies. And when you read thus often of water, clean not in the
clement or creature of water, but remember Saint John, that Jesus Christ came
by water and blood, and it 1. John 5. 6.
is he only that washes away our spots, and saves us from our sins. Water
cannot do it, nor any work of ours, but if we wash our selves with snow water
as Job says, and purge our hands most clean; Yet shall Job. 9. 30. 31.
he plunge us in the pit, and our own clothes shall make us filthy. And by the
Offering of the Turtles it was plainly figured, that not in themselves but in
some other they must be made clean from all their impurities. Sunt qui statim
se mundos putant, si peccata defleant, ieiunia multiplicent, eleemosynas
largiantur, Bona sunt haec, Fratres, sed debitum peccati no^ adaequant.
I remember the Speech of a good Writer, yet a Friar, and I pray you mark it.
There are some, says He, That think themselves by and by made clean if they
shed a few tears and bewail their sins, Multiply their fasts, and give
Alms, etc. But my Brethren, although these be good things, yet they are not
equivalent to our sins. Thus breaks truth out of them that otherwise
affected Rome. See then how Popery wrongeth the souls of men in sending them
to the things that cannot help, and drawing them deceitful from the true and
perfect sanctification and satisfaction of Christ. Remember the words of One of
theirs. Fiducialiter ad Sanctos cur^^mus, vt little meritis and praecibus ad
immortalitatem peru^mamus. Gabriel. in can. Missae. Venite ad eam (Mariam)
omnes qui laboratis and onerati estis, and dabit refrigeriu^ and solatium
animabus vestris.
We run with great boldness to the Saints, that by their merits and prayers
we may come to immortality. Come unto her all ye that travel and are heavy
laden (meaning the Virgin Marie) and she shall refresh and comfort your
souls. What is it to leave the fountains and springs of God, and to dig
unto our selves Cisternes that can hold no water, if this be not? Saint John
tells us, He, He, not she she, is the propitiation for our sins. And
therefore Come unto him all that travel, not unto her, etc. But thus seeing
our manifold uncleanness and the right remedy of it by modestly and chastely
reading over this Chapter, I wade no further in it. This is a taste of the use
of it. More will follow in the next Chapter, and Chapter 23.

CHAP. XVI.
1 STill the Lord goes on to note man's imperfections and how he is freed from
them, seeing herein consists all, that we truly know our selves to be as we
are, and the way of God appointed for our remedy. First, he Verse 2.
forbids Aaron at al times to enter into the holiest of all, whereby may be
learned that even Ministers as well as other men are not rashly to enter into
all the things of God, but to stand in reverence of some mysteries, either
dealing not at all, or very advisedly and sparingly with them as their nature
requires.

2 It is showed how he should come in, when he did Verse 3.
enter; Namely, with a young bullock for a sin offering and so forth. Learn
we may by it with what ornaments men and women should come before God. It is
not silk nor velvet that he cares for, neither the costly Jewels of pearl
and stone that we think so highly of, but come with a sin offering, that
is, come with an humble acknowledgement (as this sin offering figured) that
thou art a sinner, confess it to God with a greeuing heart, and bring Jesus
Christ in thy soul with thee, offering him by thy true faith to God his Father
as a sure safety for all sinners against deserved wrath and punishment.

3 He must also put on the holy linen coat etc. Another Verse 4.
shadow of Christ his righteousness, wherewith we must be clothed and covered
if we ever find acceptance with God. For to that end Aaron did change his
garment, to show that he sustained an other person, who was holy, he himself
being but a man subject to imperfection and sin. To which end tended also
his washing and sacrifice here mentioned.

4 This likewise served to beat into the people their corruption, when they
saw Aaron thus changed, that was the Priest chosen of God and anointed with
the holy Oil. For if he might not enter but in such sort, how much less
might they appear at any time before God but in Christ, and by Christ,
shadowed in all these sacrifices. And concerning this once entering into the
Holy place, you have had the figure of it before, and the Place to the Hebre.
noted Chap. 9. verse 8. Aaron entered but once a year, and Christ but once, the
Tabernacles diverse. Aaron by blood, Christ by blood, but the blood diverse.
Aaron made an Atonement, Christ made an Atonement, but in a differing manner.
Aaron outwardly or ciuily, as touching the sight of man; Christ, of the
conscience truly and rightly and touching God. Hebr. 9. verse 9. and 13. Aaron
often Heb. 10. 11. Christ but once Heb. 9. ver. 9. and 13.
verse 12. 14. Aaron confessed sins and laid them upon the Goat, but his
own sins as well as the peoples; Christ had no sins of his own, and ours
he bare himself, Esaias. 53. 4.
and laid them upon himself, not upon any creature whatsoever.

5 The two he Goats being presented, lots were Verse 7 8.
to be cast over them, one Lot for the Lord, and another for the Escape Goat.
Thus was it shadowed that in a sinner there is nothing to make him worthy of
God his choice. And therefore as GOD would not choose either the one Goat or
other, but by lot the one was appointed, and not by choice; so we are accepted
whenever we find favor, without all merit or matter, worth or dignity in
our selves to move the Lord to such goodness.

6 The Goat upon which the Lords lot fell was offered for sinne-offering; And
Incense cast upon the fire to Verse 9. Verse. 13.
make a cloud to cover the Mercy-seate that Aaron dyed not, the one shadowing
the death of the Son of God, and the other with what fear and reverence we
ought ever to come before God. For if to Aaron the Majesty of him were so
dangerous, how much more to others not to be compared to Aaron? Would God we
thought of this ever, when we come to Church to do our duties to him. Then
would there not, in that place, be so much light behavior and sleepie usage
of our selves as is, by Verse. 16.
which things the holy place is defiled, verse 16. Homines ita contaminant Dei
sacra, ne quid tamen discedat eorum naturae, nec dignitas violetur. Quare
diserte exprimit Moses purgari Sanctuarium ab inquinamentis non suis, sed
Filiorum Israel. Men do so pollute the holy things of God, that nothing
departs from their nature neither is their glory violated. Therefore plainly
does Moses lay down that the Sanctuary is to be purged from pollutions not
of their own, but of the Children of Israel.

7 But as touching the other Goat (called the Escape verse. 21.
Goat) it was brought alive, And Aaron (says God) shall put both his hands
upon his head of it, and confess over him all the iniquities of the Ch^ildren
of Israel, and all their trespasses in all their sins, putting them upon the
head of the Goat, and shall send him away (by the hand of a man appointed)
into the wilderness. So the Goat Verse. 22. Herodotus in Euterpe. (...).
shall bear upon him all their iniquities into the land that is not inhabited,
etc. From this Law of God, no doubt did spring that Custom among the Heathens,
who offering Sacrifices, (as Herodotus witnesses of the Egyptians) used to
banne and curse the head of the beast offered in Sacrifice, with these words.
That if any Evil be to come either upon the Sacrificers themselves, or upon
the whole Country of Egypt, it would please the Gods to turn all upon that
Head.

The Massilians also yearly used to make an Atonement Verbenis vestibusque
sacris ornatum.
or expiation for their City with some holy man, whom decked and set out with
holy garments and with Garlands after the manner of a Sacrifice, they led
through the City, and putting all the evils upon his head that might any way
hang over their City, they cast him into the Sea sacrificing of him so unto
Neptune, speaking these words with great solemnity, Be thou an expiation
(...). Sis pro nobis p^aculum.
for us. Thus the Heathen catched at things, but not in a right manner, whereby
we may well see what a darkness it is to be deprived of the light of the
Word of God. In like manner receiving it from the Doctrine of the old Fathers,
by the tradition of Noah his sons, that there should in time come a Man who
taking upon him the sins of all men, should become a Sacrifice for the
salvation of all men, and not understanding the manner how this should be, they
used in great extremities and perils, as Plagues, Famine, Wars etc, to offer
up men to their Gods to appease their wrath thereby. So in Liuie we read
Quintus Curtius did in a time of Pestilence: The Decij, Father and son, in a
time of hard War with the Latins and Samnites; Codrus King of the Athenians
in Lycurgus; Menoeceus in Euripides, and the daughters of Erecteus offered
themselves to be sacrificed for their Country. So Achas, 2. Kings 16.
Manasses, Chap. 21. and the King of Moab, Chap. 3. their own sons. This was
a great mistaking you plainly see, and therefore let it move you to send up
thankful thoughts to God for your better knowledge and understanding. What a
notable Figure again this Escape Goat was of Of the resurrection of Christ,
who though he bare our sins, yet remains alive.
Christ you see, upon his head all the sins of mankind were laid, hec
bearing them himself and remoouing them away from us, Esaias. 53. 4.

8 Well may you also mark here when Confession was made over the head of this
Goat, what diversity of words are used, as all iniquities, all trespasses,
all sins. Why so many words? but to teach that confession of sins must not
be light and formal only, but earnest, vehement, hearty, and zealous. And in
deed never can a good child of God satisfy himself herein, but still wishes
he could more bewail his sins, and more earnestly express with words what
his soul feels in this behalf: Saying as I heard a dying woman once say to
the good profit of all about her, O Sir, I am sorry and sorry, that I can be no
more sorry. etc.

9 And he that carried forth this Escape Goat shall wash Verse 26.
his clothes and his flesh in water, and after that shall come into the Host. If
such a thing did separate a man in some sort from the Church, how much more
does that sin that is our own cleaving to us and resting in us, make a
divorce betwixt God and us, and the Church and us? See therefore the use of
these Figures, to work a touch in them of the effect of sin, and let our
corruption be displeasing unto us, that we in Christ may be pleasing to God.

10 A certain day they had named here, The tenth Verse 29.
day of the seventh month, but we have now no one day, and therefore all our
life should be a time of true humbling of our selves before God. Not of bowing
down our heads like bull rushes, but of humbling our souls, even our inward
souls, as here is said and repeated. And this often iteration, that the
Priest, and none else verse. 30. Verse 32. Verse 33.
should make the Atonement; should put on the linen clothes and holy
vestments, should purge the holy Santuarie and the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, should cleanse the Altar, and make Atonement for the Priests and
People, this, I say manifestly noted out the graces of the Messiah Christ
Jesus, and directed all to him to find remission and pardon in him of all
impurities and defilings whatsoever. Thus have you some taste of the use of
this Chapter, Meditation with Prayer, will yield much more.

CHAP. XVII.
IN this Chapter you have two several The sum of the Chapter.
laws given, which you may observe. The first, that every Sacrifice should be
brought to the door of the Tabernacle, and no man should dare to offer it
otherwise. The second against eating of any blood. Concerning the first the
words are sharp, Namely, that the Lord will verse. 4.
impute blood unto him, that he has shed blood, and that he shall be cut of
from among the people. The reasons both of the Law and this severity, were
these and such like. First, because it served for the preservation of the
ministry which God had ordained, and that every man should not be his own
Priest. Secondly, because it was a chief means to keep them from idolatry,
and offering the honor due unto God to devils as the By Devils understanding
whatsoever is not the true God, read your Marginall note and mark it.
Heathens did, or to other creatures to whom it was not due. Thirdly, because
thus they were taught that all worship of God ought to be g^ided and directed
by his word and commandment, not by the private wills of men, as often before
ye have seen. Deuteronomy. 12. That which I command, that only shall ye do. Yea
in this place, note it, and ever think of it, to follow my own fancy and not
Gods prescription, is to become as odious to God as if I had killed a man Esaias
66. he that kills an Ox, is as if he killed a man, (meaning when he
kills not the Ox according to the manner appointed of God. Yet, yet, will
some men teach, and some unwise people believe, that a good intent will bear
out all, and we are not tied to the Word of God, but read and remember such
places as these. Fourthly, because hereby was signified that only in the
Church, by faith in the chief high Priest Christ Jesus, Our sacrifice and
service accepted of God, is, and can be offered and done, and no where else. 1.
Peter 2. verse 5. Hebrews 13. 15.

2 But you will say, the Scripture does often ment^^n that sacrifices were
offered elsewhere, and not brought to the door of the Tabernacle. Which is
very true; but then mark you the complaints that God makes against such
persons and their doings. Iehoshaphat did that which was right in the sight of
the Lord, but the high places were not taken away. The first of Kings 22. verse
43. The like of Ioas, the second of Kings 12. 2. 3. Of Manasses mark what is
written 2. Chron. 33. 16. 17. Of Israel, 2. of the Kings 17. 32. 33. Of Judah,
Iere. 44. etc. For in all these places you may see, that no good meanings or
intents, no colors nor couers will serve, but forasmuch as the prescript form
of bringing their sacrifices to the door of the Tabernacle, and offering them
according to ye rules given by God were not observed, therefore both they and
their worship displeased God, and that so highly, as grievously he punished
the^ for the same. And is it not a most strange dotage, to think that God
should not appoint his own worship, but we out of our idle and dark brains
do what seems good to us? Let it move you and ever work with you to your
good.

3 Yet you will say again, not only these, but the Prophets that knew their
duties, and were careful to do it, did not bring the sacrifice to the
Tabernacle, but offered in other places, as Samuel in Mispah. 1. Sam. 7. and
Elias in Mount Carmel. 1. Kings 18. You must answer your self thus touching
these men, That all this in them was extraordinary, and we may not follow
extraordinary matters without some such personal and special vocation as no
doubt they had. For we do not live by examples, but by Laws. And thus much
Non exemplis, sed legibus.
of the first Law in this Chapter.

Concerning the second Law of abstayning from eating of any blood, it was first
given to Noah, Genesis 9. Verse. 1^.
then repeated again, as you saw in the third and seventh Chap. and shall see
in the Nineteen Chap. of this Book of Leuiticus. The Lord by this Law would
teach men to abstain from murder and bloodshed, the blood of Verse 11.
man being Vehiculum animae vitalis: for the Vital spirits which yield unto
man through his whole body, heat and motion and action, are begotten of blood
by the power of the heart, and therefore man's life and the life of every other
creature, is said to be in the blood. Purpuream vomit ille an m^m Virgil.
Secondly, because the Lord had ordained blood to be used in the Atonements
made for sins, as a plain Figure of the blood of Christ, the only able thing
to purge and wash away our sins and offenses, therefore he would have blood
regarded as a holy thing, and not used by man as other meats might be. Thus
God in his Law, would not suffer man to eat the blood of a beast because it
figured the blood of his Son, and in popery we are taught to make no bones
at Christ his own blood, but to believe that the Wine in the Sacrament is
turned into his very blood really, and then to drink the same boldly. The
Gospel shall not yield so much reverence to Christ, as the Law did; Is it to
be taught and bleeued? God forbid.

2 You may remember how the Apostles continued this Law, Acts 15. 29. and ask
why being a ceremonial Law it was more continued than others? To which answer
is made, that chiefly for three Causes they did it. First, to avoid offense in
the minds of ignorant Propter Scandalum Propter Confessionem. Propter
Disciplinam.
people not yet taught, nor of the sudden apt to hear of the abrogation of
so ancient a Law ever since Noah his time. Secondly, that thus they might
show that their doctrine was no other, but even the old ancient doctrine since
the beginning of the Church. And thirdly, for discipline, that men might still
be afraid of murder by this continued ceremony. After when God had vouchsafed
to his Church further knowledge, this also was abrogated, and men left to their
liberties to eat blood as well as the flesh.

CHAP. XVIII.
IN a godly Commonwealth two things are necessary, right Religion according
to Gods word; and holy honesty of Matrimony. The first, the Lord has laid
down both in the ten Commandments, Exodus 20. and in these Sacrifices thus
passed over. The sum of this Chapter.
Now therefore it pleases him to come to the second, Unspotted Marriage. Where
he first uses a Praeface to move them to diligent observation of what herein
he should say, and then he comes to the matter it self. The first, is
contained in the five former Verses. And Verse 1.
the Lord spoke unto Moses saying, Speak unto the children verse 2.
of Israel, and say unto them, I am the Lord your God. After the doings of the
land of Egypt wherein ye verse 3.
dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the manner of the land of Canaan, whither I
will bring you, shall ye not do, neither walk in their ordinances. But do
after my judgments, verse 4.
and keep my ordinances, to walk therein: I am the Lord your GOD etc. This
Praeface of some is taken Romans 10. 5. taken generally.
generally to concern all the Laws of God, the observation whereof, is ever
the sure safety of a state public or private. For it is not the munition of
walls, leagues and aliance with foreign Princes, largenes of confines,
plenty of treasure, or such like, that preserve a Commonwealth but careful
and diligent observation of public Laws ordained of God for the good of man.
It is said Lacedemon flourished whilst Lycurgus his Laws were observed, much
more any Commonwealth when Gods be kept: for what comparison betwixt man's
Laws and Gods? Demosthenes says, It was the manner of the Locrenses that if
any man would publish and devise a New law, he should put his neck into a
halter ready to be put to death, if the Law were not good; by which means they
made men more careful to observe old and ancient, tried and known Laws, than
with busy heads to make new. Now what Laws so old and so approved good as
Gods Laws? Ever therefore are they to be regarded and hearkened unto. Others
take this Praeface particularly of these Laws concerning Marriage now
following, that if they be carefully kept, a kingdom long flourishes, and if
not, soon it comes to a fearful fall. For so odious and abhorred of God is
the unlawful mixture of man and woman, that the Lord cannot long withold
great judgments. And thus much remember as you read them ever, that these
laws do not concern the Jews only, as the Ceremonial laws now spoken of,
and judicial did, but these laws belong to all men and women and to all
succeding times, being eternal, immutable, grafted by God in man's nature, and
given by him for holiness sake. Note all the words well, that God would not
have them like either the Aeygptians or Canaanites, and wish with me, that
there were a like law against our being like foreign nations near us, with
Ruffes dipped in the devils liquor called starche, bursten-belly doublets,
guarded as the French, fringed as the Venetian, Turkish heads, Spanish backs,
Italian wastes etc. giving daily occasion to the mockers that say, French nets
catch English fools.

2 The Praeface ended, God comes to the matter Verse. 6.
it self, in the 6. verse, saying. None shall come near to any of the kindred
of his flesh to uncover her shame; I am the LORD. Kindred is of two sorts, by
society of blood, which is called Consanguinitie, or by carnal conjunction of
man and woman, which is called Affinity. That popish kindred which they called
spiritual kin dred arising by baptism or confirmation, this Chapter knows
not, neither any other part of Gods book, it was only devised for Popes gain.

verse 7. Lot his incest. Genesis 19. Inter Pelopei am and Thyestem patrem, vnde
Aegisthus natus est. Inter Oedipum and Iocastam matrem, vnde Eteocles and
Polynices procreati sunt Inter Neronem and Agrippina^ etc.
3 The greatest Consanguinitie, is betwixt Parents and children, and therefore,
that is forbidden in these words. Thou shall not uncover the shame of thy
father, nor the shame of thy mother, for she is thy mother etc. The very
Heathens abhorred this wickedness as most unnatural and vile. Yea, the Camels
(says Aristotle) abhor it by nature, and the Colt will not come near in
this sort to the Dam; God being pleased in brute beasts to give us an example
against this thing. Hermiene in Euripides could cry, it was barberous. Now,
when thus he names father or mother, you must not tie the words to our
immediate parents only, and to immediate children, but the words stretch to
all the right line of Consanguinitie either ascending or descending. For as it
is unlawful for the daughter to marry with her grandfather, or so upward in
the straight line; so is it for the Father to marry the Niece, his Neeces
daughter, or her daughters daughter, or any other down-ward again in the right
line. For all these, if you reckon ten thousand of them, are said to be as
parents and children in En ijs qui infra aut speciatim nominantur vsque ad
verse 17: aut ex illorum comparatione, per analogiam intelliguntur. Tremel and
Iun.
respect one of another. And by the Law of Nations it was ever accounted
incest, to marry upward or downward in the right line.

4 The next Law is, verse 8. 1. Cor. 5. 1.
The shame of thy fathers wife shall thou not discover: for it is thy fathers
shame. He means the wife of my father, that is, my stepmother, not mine
own mother. Which indeed properly is but Affinity, but because she is a kind
of mother, it is put here among those that are of Consanguinitie. The Heathens
detested this uncleanness, and therefore S. Paul speaking of it, says, It is
heard certainly, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as
is not once named among the Gentiles, that one should have his fathers wife.
Wherefore more monstrous was the saying of the stepmother of Anthony
Caracalla, for when Anthony was so bewitched with her beauty, that he desired
to marry her, and sighing said. O, if it were lawful! O si liceret!
She shamefully answered, if thou list, it is lawful: Si libet, licet:
principes enim dant leges, non accipiunt.
for Princes give laws, and take not. A most untrue speech in things
concerning the law of nature, as well confelsed Dionysius, when his mother
would have married otherwise than became her age, said, O mother, the civil
laws of man may be changed and altered, but the law of Nature may not. The
Apostle urges this law, you know, in a small matter, as unchangeable, saying,
Does not Nature 1. Cor. 11. 14.
tell you, it is a shame to a man if he have long hair etc. Much more then
are the weighty points of Natures Law not to be altered and changed, as by
these wicked marriages they are. Remember Ruben his incest Genesis 35. 22. 2. Sam.
16. 22.
with Bilhah; and Absolons with his fat(...)s concubines, and see the end.

5 Thou shall not discover the shame of thy sister the Verse 9.
daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether she be borne
at home, or borne without; thou shall not discover their shame. This belongs
to the collateral line, wherein Marriage is not ever forbidden as in the
straight line. This Law forbids the sister by both Parents, that is, the
full sister, or the half sister, the full by both, the half by one. For by
borne at home, Alij domi genitam interpretantur in coniugio legitimo etc. Foris
genitam extra coniugium. 2 Samuel 13. 14.
is understood the sister borne of an other wife in thy fathers house, and by
borne without, the sister of thy mother married to an other man out of her
house, where she dwelled before. Ammons incest with Thamar his sister was
against this Law, and many other like matches. Herodotus writes that Cambyses
King of Persia coveting to marry with his sister, asked his Counselors,
whether there was any Law to permit the brother to marry with the sister?
they answered after deliberation, that they could find no Law commanding
such marriage, but they found a Law whereby it was permitted to the King of
Persia, to do what he list. A most vile answer, when the Question was of the
Law of Nature. But you will say in the beginning it was thus, that brethren and
sisters married, and such like. Saint Augustine answers; True it is because of
necessity, there being then no choice. But the older this thing may Quanto
antiqu^us compellente necessitate: tanto postea factum est damnabilius
prohiben^e Religione.
be said to be in regard of such necessity, the more damnable it is now
because Religion forbids it.

Verse. 10. Verse 11.
6 The shame of thy sons daughter, or of thy daughters daughter thou shall
not, I say, uncover their shame; for it is thy shame. This is the right line
again wherein never marriage is lawful, and was touched before verse 7.

7 The shame of thy fathers wives daughter, begotten of thy father (for she is
thy sister) thou shall not, I say, discover her shame. This is a repetition, as
men think, of the Law before verse 9. to show that that Law was to be
understood of a sister by the one parent or other, and not of a sister by
marriage of father and mother. For the husbands son by another wife, may
marry with his wives daughter by an other man, albeit they be brother and
sister in law.

8 Thou shall not uncover the shame of thy fathers sister: Verse 12. Verse. 13.
for she is thy fathers kinswoman. Thou shall not uncover the shame of thy
mothers sister: for she is thy mothers kinswoman. These two Laws concern the
Aunt by father or mother. It is a law of Nature. And as it is not lawful for
the man to marry his mothers sister, so it is not for the woman to be married
to her mothers brother, because these persons be as Parents. So go on to the
great Aunt by father or mother.

9 Thou shall not uncover the shame of thy fathers Verse. 14.
brother: That is, thou shall not go into his wife, for she is thy Aunt. Now
he comes to affinity, as the Uncles wife by either father or mother, that
is, either my fathers brothers wife, or my mothers brothers wife, for these are
as step-father, or stepmother.

10 Thou shall not discover the shame of thy daughter Verse 15.
in Law; for she is thy sons wife; Therefore shall thou not uncover her
shame. This is the nearest affinity that is, of the father to his daughter in
law, and the mother in law to her son in law. Therefore it is no marriage
lawful. Read Chap. 20, Verse. 12.

11 Thou shall not discover the shame of thy brothers verse 16.
wife: for it is thy brothers shame. This* was to be understood then, during
the life of his brother, and so in the next Chap. verse 21. For otherwise in
those days, it was lawful for the brother to raise up seed to his brother,
Deuteronomy. 25. But now it binds us ever, as appears by John to Herod, It is not
lawful for thee to Mark 6. 1^.
have thy brothers wife.

12 Thou shall not discover the shame of the wife and verse 17.
of her daughter, neither shall thou take her sons daughter, nor her
daughters daughter, to uncover her shame; for they are thy kinsfolks, and it
were wickedness. These horrible incests are well known to any, and therefore
need no further speech. God give grace and strength to avoid them according to
our knowledge.

13 Thou shall not take a wife with her sister, during Verse 18.
her life to vex her, in uncovering her shame upon her. Know that Moses here,
has written but a brief of these matters, not naming all, but leaving to
Natural reason, by these examples to understand all others, which by the same
Law of Nature are forbidden. Moses names not the Uncle by Father, or Uncle by
Mother. But as in genealogies, commonly the mention is of men; so in these
descriptions of Marriages, lawful and unlawful, mention is made but only of
women. But the same degrees restrain both men and women. If any man think of
some marriages of holy men in scripture contrary to these Rules, let him
remember, that we now live by laws and not by examples. What God then either
approved or tolerated, let us neither rashly condemn, nor unadvisedly follow,
but obediently tarry within the precin^^s of the law of nature. And again, in
these cases let it ever be remembered, as good reason is it should, not only
what is lawful, but what also is convenient and fit to be done. For many
things are lawful which are no way yet expedient, but most unfit in regard of
some circumstances.

14 Thou shall not go to a woman to uncover her shame, whilst she is put a
part for her disease. Neither Verse. 19. Verse 20.
shall thou give thy self to thy neighbors wife, to be defiled with her by
carnal copulation. Here he descends to other foul and ungodly mixtures
which very Nature should teach men also to abhor, and the first, is that
whith is with a woman when she has her natural course repeated in the 20.
Chapter, verse 18. and a penalty of death set upon it, both for the man that
does it, and the woman that will suffer it to be done to her in that case; so
God loves purity and would have all his to love it. The second is Adultery,
which likewise by the Law then, was death, and should have some sharper
punishment than in our days it has among us.

15 Also thou shall not give thy children to offer verse. 21.
them unto Mo^ech, neither shall thou defile the Name of the LORD thy GOD; For
I am the LORD. Some think Molech was a holow Image, Wherein the Children were
put and fire under, so to burn them as pleasing Sacrifices to their Gods.
Others think they were two fires, betwixt which they went. Read your
Marginall note in your Bible, which is large. This after a sort did they, that
gave their children ever to be cloystred up, there to burn in sinful lusts,
to the loss of both body and soul, whereas the other fire burned but the
body.

16 Thou shall not lie with the Male, as one lies Verse. 22. Verse 23.
with a Woman: for it is abomination. Thou shall not also lie with any beast
to be defiled therewith, neither shall any Woman stand before a beast to lie
down thereto: for it is abomination. Ye shall Verse 24.
not defile your selves in any of these things: for in all these the Nations
are defiled which I will cast out before you: And the land is defiled: I will
visit therefore the Verse 25.
wickedness thereof upon it, and the land shall vomit out her inhabitants. Of
these ugly pollutions the least thought it too much. God and nature abhor
them, and the fearful fire of God upon Sodom and Gomorrah Genesis 19. 24.
bids all flesh beware them. Read the first to the Romans Verse. 28.

17 From the 26. verse to the end, you see the penalty of breaking these holy
laws of a pure God, as in the beginning you see the profit of keeping of them.
Learn then, that not foreign foes only may bring a land to desolation and
destruction, but much sooner and soarer, these homebred impurities, which if a
godly magistrate, master, father, or mother keep down, they procure the peace
and safety of the land or house, more than if they resisted violence with
arms and weapons. To vomit out her inhabitants and to spew out her people, are
terms of great vehemency in God, and therefore most great should man's fear
be, lest he should provoke him to such ver geance. Sit but with your self,
and meditate of great men and great houses, meaner men and meaner houses and
you will remember great examples of the effect of an unclean life in men and
women. Happy are they whom other men's harms do make to beware.

18 Although I might here stay upon these things, that have bin thus breefly
noted, concerning this Chap. and leave you not without some profit: yet for
as much as upon these laws concerning lawful and unlawful marriages, many
points fall often to be spoken of, I will a little further proceed, and acquaint
you with the good labors of some writers, which you by your self,
peradventure, otherwise shall not obtain and get knowledge of. And first,
concerning marriage it self, in general, let it ever be duly considered,
that as unlawful and impure conjunction of man and woman is detested of God,
so is holy and lawful matrimony, with him ever accepted, and allowed, and
crowned with many blessings of his favor and love, being honorable among all,
and the bed undefiled. The Scriptures are full of the Heb. 13. 4.
praises of it, and of good advise given to married persons. We have all been
borne by it, and as God shall appoint, may come to it. Let therefore no crosses
worldly, abate the reputation of it in our hearts. Let no popish parasite
trouble us, that with a foul mouth from a foul heart, calls that unclean,
which God has sanctified. Deceiptfull time-seruers, God in time will discover,
together with their impurities covertly committed, by contempt of his ordinance
appointed for their good, nothing casting out such an ugly sent into his
nostrels, as their forced chastity, indeed very monstrous villainy, does. Till
then, scorn them that scorn God, and if they think you encumbered, know you
them to be tormented within and without, a further torment tarying for them,
when God his time shall be. In policy to destroy piety, will prove but bad
policy in the end, if this Chapter be true, which we know cannot deceive. But
marriage must be according to these Rules of Consanguinitie and Affinity,
about which if any doubt arise, that by this Chapter you plainly cannot
discuss, it shall be safe to confer with men learned in the laws of God and
men. The Civil law reckons degrees one way, and the C(...)non law an other
way. The Civil keeps this Rule still, that look how many persons there are,
so many degrees there are, taking Quot sunt personae, tot sunt gradus, vna
dempta, scilicet stipite.
one away, to wit, the root. The C(...)on law stretches restreynt further
than Gods word does, therefore idle in that respect, there being no
transgression where no law of God is. Concerning marriage, many questions
happen by occasion to be both thought of and spoken of, whereof I will give you
a taste.

First, seeing nothing is more contrary to marriage than want of consent,
Marriage, indeed, being but a consent of two fit persons to go together in
such sort, according to the will of God, and nothing more contrary to consent
than error and compulsion, of both these, there arises question. And first of
Error or mistaking, whether it does make a marriage void or no? Answer is
made, that Error or mistaking is of four sorts; namely, of Fortuna.
Qualitatis. Personae Conditionis.
Fortune, of Quality, of Person, and of Condition. And for the two first, the
Rule is, that error of Fortune or quality excludes not Consent of Marriage.
But the error of the two latter, Namely, of person and condition, does. Now
error or mistaking of Fortune, is when the Man takes his Bride, or She her
Bridegroom to be richer tha^ he proves to be. Error of Quality, when the
Bride is thought to be honest, chaste, modest, painful and a good huswife,
when in deed she is de^^led, drunken, slothful, and a waster. Error of
Person, is when to the woman is betrothed the eldest son, and the youngest by
deceit given her. This was Jacobs case, who expected Rachel and had Leah, but
his consent after, made it a marriage. Error or mistaking Genesis 29. 23.
of Condition is when the man or woman is thought free, and in deed is bond,
which in old times was wont to dislolue matrimony, but if the man knew it
before, it was no cause of breach: Yet if his hap was to light of a woman
defiled in stead of an honest, it might not dissolve the marriage, although
the error was a great deal worse, than to marry a bondwoman in stead of a
free. Nevertheless in some Consistories of foreign Countries, if a man find
such an error, and accuse her, and pray to be separated, this order is keept.
First, if the woman deny it, and the man cannot plainly prove it, although he
have shrewd suspicions, he shall not put her away, the 22. of Deuteronomy. plainly
forbidding it. But if the fact be evident by being with child, etc. Then the
Judge first persuades a reconciliation, willing the woman with all submission
to pray pardon and forgiveness at the man's hands, and wishing the man
compassionately to remit it upon a new life, it being not done in his time. If
the man will not be moved so to do, then in the third place, the Judge
diligently inquireth, whether after it was known, the man had ever knowledge
of the woman's body, and if he had, then shall he be remediless and take her,
if he had not, the next Question is whether she was abused after she was
betroathed to the man or no? if she were, then as an adulterer she is judged,
if it were before she was betroathed, and the man, after he knew it, touched
her not, neither can be persuaded to remit it, as an Adulterer also she is
sentenced the 22. of Deutro. requiring her to be put to death, who being
defiled, yet after marries as a maid and so deceives him that knew not of it.
Thus did even the honester Heathens also censure such women, as you may see in
the Tragedy of Euripides called Ion. And thus of Error in mistaking.

Question again is sometime moved touching a Vow.
vow, whether that do hinder marriage or no. And true answer is made, that a
vow made by man or woman to live sole and chaste, who find not that power and
gift given them of God, hinders them not from the remedy and ordinance of God
against it in that behalf. Because man's vow against Gods will may not bind,
and Gods will is, that such as feel cause Numb. 30. 6.
should marry 1. Cor. 7. Again, if a vow in a thing possible and lawful
might not bind against she will of an earthly father or superior, how much
less must it Vinculum iniquitatis. Quidam nubentes post votum asserunt
adulteros, Ego autem dico vobis, quod grauiter peccant, qui tales diuidunt.
lib. 1. Epist. dict. 28. Cap.
hold against the heavenly Father, our God and maker, and become so a bond of
iniquity to us? Plainly therefore, says Cyprian. Some affirm them to be
A(...)terers that marry after a vow, but I tell you they grievously offend
that separate such.

A third Question, Whether Spiritual kindred, (as they call it) growing by
Christning a child, or being Godfather at the Bishop etc, hinder marriage?
The answer is, that God has no such law, but man's covetousness was the
inventor of it, making many restraints, to get the fee thereby of many
dispensations. We are all the spiritual sons and daughters of God, and yet
may marry except in cases by him forbidden, whereof this is none, that if she
and I christened a child together, or if I were Godfather to her child, I may
not after marry with the mother of the child, and so forth.

Fourthly, whether a man may marry her whom formerly he has adulterously
abused in her husbands life time? Auswere, No, by the Canon Law, and surely
they had much reason to dislike of such matches. Council. Triburiense in
Germania, Anno 895. Can. 40. tale connubium anathematizat. Aug. to. 7. de
nuptijs and concupiso. lib. 1. Cap. 10. Damnat. 1. Cor. 7. 12.
Yet in some countries after penance and punishment, they suffer, it to avoid
other inconveniences, and they ground themselves upon David's marrying of Vriah
his wife, whom he had wronged in her husbands life.

Fifthly, diversity of Religion whether does it break marriage? The answer
is, No, and these scriptures so teach us. If any brother have a wife that is an
unbeliever and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And if
any woman have an unbelieving husband, Verse 13.
who consents to dwell with her, let her not put him away. For the
unbelieving husband is sanctified by Verse 14.
the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband 1. Cor. 7. If
any man come unto me, and do not hate his wife and children, and brethren and
sisters (to wit, thinking ill in Religion, or going about to draw him away) he
cannot be my disciple. Luke 14. 26. Therefore such a wife a man may have, and
yet his wife. Let the wives be subject to their husbands (meaning although
happily differing in Religion) that even they which obey not the Word, may
without the Word be won by the conversation of the wives 1. Pet. 3. 1.
After, the Church forbad such Marriages to be made, as the Israelites were
forbidden to marry with Strangers, lest by such Wives they might be allured
and drawn from God unto Idolatry, as was the wisest man that ever was Solomon.
Read Deuteronomy. 7. Exodus 34. Joshua. 23. Esra 10. Nehem. Quomodo potest congruere
charitas, si discrepet fides? etc.
13. etc. And still it is good to continue this care, for it is the chief band
of love, when both hearts be knit in God. * And how can there be an agreeing
love, where there is a disagreeing faith? says Saint Ambrose. And therefore
beware, O Christian, how thou give thy Daughter to a Gentile or a Jew. But
when two are already married dissenting in Religion, they may not by color
thereof be put a sunder. as Anabaptist, use to forsake their wives. The safe
way is to look before hand, and so may you prevent many a twitching grief in
the heart, that will arise if you draw two ways. Examples there are too many
known unto you of this thing. Inward woe, and outward shame with much charge
and cost some endure by their wives wilfulness, when their children might also
be better brought up, but I stay my self. It is a biting thought to consider,
that one half of me daily serves the Devil.

Sixthly, yet force and compulsion, you will say, is contrary to marriage,
because it is contrary to a free consent. In deed it is a great wrong, to
compel children against their wills to marry with such as they abhor. For
what peace can be where love is not? Nay, what mischief will not there creep
in, as brawlings, raylings, hatred, neglect of childrens education, of household
affairs, and many times, unfaithfulness of the one toward the other, which
God plagueth, and the world speaks shame of. In a word, what comfort either
in sickness or health, or any way? But yet, if a marriage be thus made,
although the Child, (if at liberty) would not have so married, it is a
marriage and must stand.

Seauenthly, for one that is violently taken away, what shall we say? Surely,
the Civil Law appointed, that a Maid taken away should never marry with the
person that so did take her; but should have all his goods. And if she did
marry with him, then should she never be capable of any goods of his, and if
the Father would consent to such a marriage, he should be banished. But the
Canon Law determines otherwise, Namely, that if the Maid taken away
willingly consented, and the Parents also afterward, Romani Sabinas, etc. apud
Herod. page 1. alia exempla.
then he that stale her away, after penance done, might marry her.

Eighthly, sor matter of contract before Marriage, Sponsalia, Sponsus and
Sponsa, a sponte spondendo.
you may here take occasion to think of it, and to remember, that it is a
very ancient and commendable thing in the Church of God, thus to be betrothed
with consent of friends, before the day of full marriage. There are diverse
Treatises of it which you may read. With consent of friends I say, because so
the Scriptures teach and much urge, giving the Father authority to deny his
Child, although she have been carnally known, if he do not like, Exodus
22; and if he will consent, the offender shall both marry her and indowe her,
whether he will or no, such a thing is the Parents authority in marriage.
Sampson though a man grown, yet speaks to his parents for a wife. Iud. 14.
Of Abraham for his son Isaac, and Isaac for his son Jacob, what do you
read? As also how it grieved them that Esau was so Genesis 28. 26.
disobedient as to marry without their consents. And as was noted before in
the Question of a vow, if a promise made by a Child to God without consent of
Numb. 30. 6.
Father might not stand, much less must a promise made to man be good without
Parents allowance. For the Civil Laws of men, surely so did they insist upon
this consent, that if the Father be absent, and it unknown either whether he
is dead, or whether he be alive; yet require they, that the child stay three
years, to see if he may be heard of, and his consent had. And they will not
admit that child that is borne of one married without this consent, unless it
be such a match as is apparent the Father would not have misliked, if he had
been present. The Canons in like sort, altogether confirm this consent of
Parents aledging that example of Rebecca, and saying. Honorantur Rebeccae
parents muneribus, consulitur puella, non de sponsalibus (illa enim expectat
iudicium parentum, non est enim Virginalis pudoris eligere maritum) sed iam
desponsata viro, de profectionis die consulitur etc. The Parents of Rebecca are
honored with gifts, and the Maid is asked, but not touching the marriage,
(for therein she rested upon the judgment of her Parents, it not agreeing
with a Maidens modesty, to choose a husband) but being promised to a man she
is asked concerning the journey. etc. In Euripides also, whereso-euer he had
it, a Maid is brought in saying, (...).
Touching my marriage my Parents will take care, for this thing belongs not
to me. Which saying, Luther Sponsalium meorum pater men's curam subibit: and
non est me^^ statuere hoc.
very fitly, with change but of two words applies unto Faith, not disputing
in temptation of the greatness and multitude of sins, but simply and wholly
relying upon the mercy of God in Christ, and saying: A (...).
Of my sins my Savior takes the care, and that care belongs not to me.
Uery Natural reason again, tells and teaches, that a child, bred up with
such care and charge of Parents many years, should not at the end requite all
their love so, as to dispose of himself, or herself in a state that dureth to
death, without their priuitie, advise, and consent. And the most undutiful
child that ever was, if he or she live to have a child, would not be so
served by that child. Let then Gods Law, and man's Law, Natural reason, and
common honesty prevail with all good Children, to perform this duty to
their Parents, and let good Parents again, not neglect in due time to provide
fit matches for their Children, whereby their virtue and good report may
remain without blot or blemish not standing ever upon the heaps of trash to
be had, but chiefly of Religion and Honesty. Such Parents as are faulty this
way, being very well able to give that which is convenient for the preferment
of their Children, it is to be wished, that the Christian Magistrate would
compel them, as has been used in good governments and states. Certainly, it
is a tyranny over their children that is most worthy of punishment and
amendment. The disparagement that has grown to good houses this way, is too
well known, and the spoil of those that might have been a comfort to their
friends by well doing, if their Parents would have done their duties, is to be
lamented as often as it is thought of. Had I wist, (says the old proverb)
comes ever too late: And I pray God work in the hearts of all Parents to
think of it, whilst they have time to prevent evil.

Ninthly, touching secret contracts, they have ever been odious to God and his
Church, and therefore as many as regard either, will beware of them and avoid
them. And if any such thing be done, discreet Governors have held this course
according to good Laws. First, if a party claim a promise denied by the
other party, and have no proof at all of it, not so much as one witness, but
only offers to swear it, in that case no oath shall be taken, neither shall
the party proceed to vex the other, but must simply give over and be quiet.
But if he or she can prove it by due testimony, a day is appointed for both
to appear, and first the Complainenant is to be heard apart, and his tale laid
down with all circumstances, then is the Defendant called, and required to
answer every point of the former tale, and if so truth cannot appear, then
to Witnesses, etc. The Canon Law is much to blame in this point, yielding more
to these secreat contracts than it should be, so crossing both the Law of God
and Nature, as also of good Emperors and Governors in their time. Contracts
Sponsalia De futuro, de presenti; pub(...)a, clandestina: cum consensu, sine
consensu parent^: pura, conditionalia: certa, in^erta, etc. Ego ac^ip^o (...)
in meum. Ego accipiam te in meum.
before Marriage, are made either by words of a future time, or a present
time; either publicly, or secreatly: either with consent of Parents or
without; either pure or conditional; either certain or uncertain: etc. Words
of the present time, when it is said, I do take you for my Husband; I do take
you for my Wife. Words of the future time, when it is said, I will take you.
The first of these forms does bind, so that if either part break and marry
elsewhere, that actnall Marriage is to be dissolved, and the former contract
ratified, yea, although they have lain together; but the latter form binds
not but may be altered, and the parties marry otherwise, if they dislike
before marriage. Public Contracts are when the Minister and other honest
friends and Witnesses are present; Secret when none but the parties either to
other pass promise, the former has consent of Parents, the later has none,
and therefore is wicked and sinful. Conditional Contracts are with conditions
honest and lawful, or otherwise: honest and lawful condition performed make
the Contract good; dishonest and unlawful although performed, make no lawful
Marriage, etc. Certain Contracts are when the party is certain, as this
Daughter by name; uncertain when the party is uncertain, as I will marry
one of the Daughters, naming none. Of all which points, the Law has large
discourse and many questions, which you may best learn of them that are
Professors of that knowledge, unto whose good advise, (as I said before) I hold
it the safest way ever to have recourse upon any occasion. For a building well
made and upon firm ground, will stand with comfort against all assaults and
objections, cast out either by Satan desirous to trouble our consciences, or by
evil tongues envying our peace.

Tenthly, touching Poligamie, whether it is lawful for any man at once to have
two or more wives. The truth is plain; No. For God made but one Adam and Genesis
1. 26. Genesis 2. 22.
one Eve, that neither man might expect more Wives, nor woman, more Husbans at
once than one. And in this first institution, expressly it was said. A man shall
leave father Genesis 2. 24.
and mother and cleave to his wife, not wives, and they two, not they three or
more shall be one flesh. Also when Lamech brake this Law by having more wives,
and Genesis 4. 19.
after him both Jews and Gentiles followed this liberty; Christ the true
teacher calls them to the first institution, and plainly says, From the
beginning it was Mat. 19. 8. Mat. 19. 5. 1. Cor. 7. 2.
not so, repeating the former Scripture, they two shall be one. etc. The
Apostle S. Paul following this truth, says, for avoiding of fornication, let
every man have his wife, not wives; and let every woman have her own husband,
not Verse 3. Verse 4.
husbands. Again, let the husband give to his wife due benevolence, not to his
wives; And the wife has not power of her own body, but her husband. Let a
Bishop 1. Tim. 3. 2.
be the husband of one wife, not of many, as then was used of too many; still
and ever using (as you see) the singular number, not the plural. Further, you
know that marriage represents the covenant betwixt Christ and his Church, and
therefore is called a mystery, but Christ Ephe. 5. 32.
has only one Church, and the Church has only one Christ, therefore
plurality of wives or husbands is a fault, and may not be endured. The good
peace and unity Read Euripedes in Andromache. (...). etc. Again: (...).
that ought to be in married couples is thus broken, and the house filled with
brawlings, and heart-burnings, factions, divisions, and all ungodliness.
Therefore very Reason teaches us to abhor Polygamie. Good Governors moved
herewith, have ever by their imperial and godly laws punished it and
forbidden it, as might be showed if it were fit.

But you will say, the godly Fathers in the old Testament had many wives and
God suffered it: etc. You must then again consider with your self touching
them, that suffering and allowing or commanding differ much. Suffered it was,
commanded or allowed simply never. Secondly, latter laws take away former,
and Christ by calling men to the first institution of Marriage took away that
permission and sufferance of Moses. Thirdly, Privileges do not overthrow a
rule. And therefore, although Priuilegia non ever tunt regulam. Genesis 22. 17.
God having promised to make Abraham's seed as the stars of the heaven for
multitude was pleased to suffer variety of wives for a time, as a fit means
speedily and greasly to increase that posterity and offspring; yet was not a
taking away of his certain rule, but when the cause ceased by a multitude
proceeding from Abraham's loins, the thing suffered only for that end, ceased
also, and may net any further be followed.

Fourthly, we truly answer again, that we live Legibus, non exemplu. Sancti
non fuerunt. (...), Ezechiel. 20. 18. 19.
by laws, and not by examples. And touching faults in the Fathers we well
must remember the words of God to the Jews by Ezekiel his Prophet, In
Praeceptis meis, In my Commandments you shall walk, and not in the
commandments of your Fathers. And again in this Chapter. After the doings of
the Land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt shall ye not do, neither after the
manner of the Land of Canaan whither I will bring you etc. But after my
Judgments shall ye do, and you shall keep My Ordinances to walk therein
for I am the Lord etc. Thus of marriage making and keeping. Now, a little of
Divorce and separation might be added, if there were not more cause in these
sinful times, to ex^ort al married couples to mutual love and faithfulness, to
patience and quietness, and to the utter abandoning of al vain and wicked
imaginations, suspicions, and ielousies, than to speak of breakings and
departing one from the other, to the great offense of God, grief of friends,
and ill example to others evermore apt to learn what is evil than what is
good. I will therefore spare this pains, and rather entreat all those that fear
God, often to remiber young Tob^e his prayer, that God in mercy would grant to
Tobie. 8. 7(...) 9 ^0. Solinus lib. 10 cap. 5. Cic. Ius^. (...). (...).
him and his wife that they might become aged together, to which she said with
him, Amen. We read of ye Indian women that though their husbands have diverse
wives, yet they did by all means indeauor to continue in love with him. and when
he dies, she that was best beloved, with great joy and glory that she was so,
goes into the fire with his Corpse and burns with his dead body. Such
continuing affection in those that know not God, must needs be a condemnation
to all tickle tickle starting aside in such as know God, and his commandment
in this behalf. Holy, constant, and continued Matrimony is like (say some) to
that little City Zoar, where Lot was saved, when to the Mountain he was
unwilling to go, and in filthy Sodom could not be safe. To live licentiously,
is to live in Sodom, to live single (having the gift) is to escape into the
mountain. Such as flying from the one, cannot attain to the other having not
the gift given of God, in little Zoar, that was betwirt both, that is, in holy
wedlock, which is the middle estate, may be saved. Ever therefore make much of
it, and lightly and unjustly break not in sunder that holy knot. Sweetness is
the Sister of Love, as bitterness is the Sister of hatred. Marriage love then
being an holy love, will in all troubles taste contentment and comfort though
not one way, yet another, still to the preserving of the knot, and of Christian
cohabitation. The two Kyne that carried the Ark of God kept one path and
turned neither to the right 1. Sam. 6.
hand, nor to the left: so should married couples do says S. Gregory, seeing
by the profession of the Christian faith they also carry the Arc. If the
Glass which you look in should return your countenance sad when you are
merry, or merry when you are sad, were it not a great fault in the Glass?
Certainly so is it, if married couples differ and be not merry together, sorry
together, contented together, and either of them ever as a true glass to the
other, showing such agreement as is fit for them, till God and time shall
break their days of, and take the one of them to him. The Wife of Augustus
Caesar, Liuia, being asked of one, how she did live in such peace with her
Husband the Emperor, who had his infirmities some ways to work anger?
answered, Castitatem meam accurate tuendo; quicquid ille vult alacriter
faciendo: nullas res eius curiose vestigando etc. By preserving mine own
c^^stitie carefully: by doing whatsoever he wills cheerfully: and by not
prying into, or meddling with any matters of his curiously or busily, etc. Three
notable virtues in a wise woman, to continue love and peace betwixt her and her
Husband, the contraries whereof, are causes of many fires and flames where they
should not be. For these points of rare wisdom; and for that she had been a
means to preserve many a Senators life and others that were questioned and in
danger in her time, had not she graciously wrought for them; and for that she
had brought up many a man's child by her charity; and married many a poor
Maiden by her liberality; she was mourned for a whole year, by all the
Matrons and women in Rome when she was dead, by a special decree of the Senate.
So will virtue private and public have his due honor with thankful hearts
at last. Chaste she was, you see, and no envy or malice of man or Devil can
bury that virtue so, but that it will rise and live with renown in despite
of all Devils. Matronis dos pulcherima Bias: and Plautus in Amph.
vita pudica. O! it is a dowry of dowries to a woman a chaste and virtuous
carriage of her self. If she be hard of favor, yet when she looks in a
glass, she may cheerfully say to her self, Woman comfort thy self, for thy
Plutarch in praeceptis coniugalibus.
beauty is inward, thou art honest, and it is a great and an approved beauty
of all men. If she be fair and not chaste, she may sigh and say, O how fair
should thou have been, if honest? Nulla, reparabilis, art, lapsa
pudicitia. Oxid epist. 5.
No art of man and wit can make whole again decayed and broken virtue in this
point; therefore, with all power and strength of will, wit, and prayer,
preserve it, and leave the report of it to the comfort of your posterity and
friends. Obedient also, you see, was this worthy Liuia to her husband, not
only doing, but doing cheerfully, that is, without any manner of crossing or
stopping, grudging or grieuing, whatsoever he required. A virtue again that
will not die, but force-foorth praise even from very enemies. Vir a vi dictus;
mulier a mollitie: A man has his name of strength and force; a woman Varro.
Lactant.
of softness, because in all things toward her husband, she is soft and
gentle, and most readily obedient and tractable. Gods law has so appointed
that they should Genesis 3. 1. Pet. (...). 1. 1. Cor. 7. 4. Ephe 5. 22. Coloss. 3.
Verse 18. In Oeconom. 2. ca. 1.
obey, and all virtuous woman deeply regard it. Uery Aristotle an Heathen man
could write and teach, that a good woman takes her husbands will to be a Law
to her, which she will observe and not violate. The stars all have their
light from the Sun, and if you ask them, they will very thankfully
acknowledge it. The body has his grace from the head, and will be ruled by
the head in all things without gainsaying. The man, you know, is the woman's
head, Ephesians 5. Women had their v^^les, and still have their long hair, to
note this holy order of obdience and subjection to their husbands, and
therefore it was said, Etiam Anathema sit mulier, quae comam sibi amputat,
quam Deus ad memoriam subiectionis illi dedit: Even accursed let that woman be
which cutteth of her hair, given her of God to remember her of obedience and
subjection to her husband. Vashti her refusal to come when the King sent for
her, turned to her hurt you know; and ^est. 1.
the example of such disorder is desired by all the Wise to be prevented. Sara
is proposed to all virtuous women to be followed in her ready, loving, and
constant obedience to her husband Abraham, calling him Lord, etc.

The third Virtue of renowned Liuia was you saw, that she busily pryed not
into her husbands actions, neither meddled with his matters but left his place
and the works of it unto him, herself dealing with her own duties. And what
a thing is this to preserve love and peace ever betwixt couples? Iezabels such
1. Kin. 21. 7.
meddling with the matter of Naboth, wounted Ahab, overthrew herself, and the
ignominy of it lives and will never dye. Stories do yield us many other
examples, and I would our own times yielded us none. I speak of unfit
curiosity, and not of any good concurrence in well-doing. For we all know,
Pilate had been happy, if in that matter of his Office Mat. 27. 19.
and of Justice, he had hearkened to his Wives dutiful wish, and not
prooceeded as he did, against the Lord Jesus, Thus remains honorable Liuia
the Empress a worthy Example to all of her Sex, how to live in Love and Peace
with their husbands, so that no divorce shall be either spoken or thought of
during life, but longing wishes for contynuance many years, and even to be
the later of the two, that goes to the earth. For such Wives, as they were
worthy ones whiles they lived, so will they be missed and many times thought
of, when they be gone. Here might I stay, but since I am entered into this
matter, give me leave to add two or three things more, being euer-shining
Virtues in Women, and great means of Love, Amity, and Unity betwixt married
couples. Faithfulness to their Husbands is one, I mean a true constancy of
heart, preferring their well-doing, before all men and matters whatsoever
worldly. Such as was in Zipporah Moses his Wife, who most tenderly loving her
Child, and therefore very loath to shed any of his blood, yet when she saw
her Husband in danger, for omitting that Circumcision, rather than he shall
miscarrie, she Exodus 4. 25.
addresseth her-selfe and that speedily to do that duty, whereby her Husband
might live, although her child smarted. And she did it not in a fury, (as
some have taken the place) but in a most faithful affection, to the
preservation of her husband like a loving wife. Neither do her words Sponsus
tu mihi es sanguinum, Thou art a husband of blood unto me, sound forth anger
and choler, but sweetness and love; as if she had said, My love to thee has
been such, (dear husband,) as that it has made me forget woman-hood, to lay
aside all motherly affection, and to redeem thy life, and contynuance to me,
with the blood of my child, etc. Such again, was that in Michal to David her
husband, 1. Sam. 19. 11.
when she let him down at the window to escape from her fathers fury, and
laid an Image in the bed as if he had been there sick. Such the care of
Abigael, when she heard her husband had ouer-shot himself toward David's
messengers, rather than any hurt should come to 1. Sam. 25.
him for such unadvised speeches, she prepared a very honorable Present, and
goes her self to prevent anger, which she did indeed, to the safety of her
husband and all his. Such the love of Theopompus his wife, who when her husband
was taken and put in prison by his enemies, getting leave to go into the prison
to him on a time, gave him her clothes to escape in, and she taking his,
remained in his place, to abide any danger that might ensue, rather than he
should be oppressed by his foes. Such those worthy women, that when the City
was besieged by Frederick Barbarossa, and at last license given to the women,
that they might depart taking only such things with them as they could
themselves carry, in stead of any worldly riches which they inioyed, they took
upon their backs and under their arms, their husbands and children, parents
and kinsfolks, to the eternal praise of their virtue, and the great
astonishment of their enemies that looked on and saw it. Unfaithfulness and
treachery to husbands, has left an other report in Stories, if I should enter
into it. But such hateful things are better forgotten and never known. These
graceful Virtues let all gracious women think of, and leave behind them the
like praise.

Silence, again, or little speech, what a virtue? what (...).
a preserver of peace if a woman be blessed with it. The contrary, what hurt
and bywords has it wrought? Prouerbio dicitur, Tres mulieres nundinas facere.
The Chiliad. Erasm. 3. Contur. 6. Proverb. 77.
Proverb says, That three women make a fair. And words are wanting to women
as singing is to the Nightingale, who is said, to be only a voice, in respect
of the sound she gives forth being so little a Bird; as verses are wanting
to a Poet; Figures of speech to Vbi minus est roboris aut cordis, plus est
linguae.
an Orator; or false arguments to a Sophister, that is, they abound with them,
and often superabound. (...) Eurip. in A^ace.
Few words in a woman is a great ornament. tacita quoque melior est mulier
semper, quam loquens. Plautus in Rudente.
And many a woman holding her peace is better thought of, than when she
speaks. Plutarch. in praeceptis coniugalibus.
Loquitur aut viro, aut per virum: A woman speaks either to her husband, or
by her husband. To her husband, orderly and necessarily; by her husband, as
unwilling to tattle much with strangers, seeking the praise of a roling tongue,
and loosing paraduenture the renown of modesty and wisdom. Look how milk
is said to kill the force of Gunpowder, and so be ever assured that soft words
or silence will do to anger betwixt man and wife. And let these things work a
love of little speech not multiplying words with your husband, especially when
he is moved and grieved with some other matters, bying and reuying, and will
he, still he, still having the last word. For surely that does no good. The
old Paynters if they pictured a woman, were ever wont to put under her foot a
Snayle, as well to remember this virtue of silence to her, which is in the
Snayle, as of carrying her house upon her back as the Snayle does.

Yet such silence is meant, as does not abandon affability and courtesy when
there is cause, for this also is another great preserver of love and amity, in
so much that the wise man says, Mulier comis exhilerat maritum, and cum
humaniter illum tractat cor illius reficit ac recreat. A gentle and mild woman
makes glad her husband, and when she deals courteously with him, she
refreshes and recreateth his very heart. Loving speech is a Physician to the
mind, to clear it and cleanse it from much grief. He that will take birds,
may not come to them with a staff, (says the old Proverb,) but a sweet
sounding pipe is more auailable, and think you that she which will have her
husbands liking must use harsh and bitter words? What a power had wise Abigael
over that fierce anger of valiant David with her soft words and mild speech,
even when he had but death and blood in his heart toward her husband and his
family, for the great contempt showed unto him? Could rough and sower speeches
have so prevailed? No, no, you know fire is not quenched with fire, but with
cold and soft water. Pax and mansuetudo characteres animae piae. Peaceablenesse
and mildness they are the notes, marks, and Basil.
prints of a good mind, and of a holy and Christian soul. But this is enough,
I will go no further. Try me and trust me, you shall not repent it. Let the
weapons of a woman be either soft words, or modest silence with a dropping
tear if there be wrong done, and it shall pierce a heart of steel, working
such effects as all the hot speech that an unbridled tongue can utter shall
not bring forth.

Wisdom and discretion again in a wife, O powerful mean to make love and
to do much good! A wise woman (says the Holy Ghost) builds her house: Prou.
14. 1. Pro. 31. 23.
but the foolish destroys it with her own hands. By a wise woman her husband
is known in the gate, when he sits with the Elders of the Land. Strength
and honor Verse 25.
is her clothing, and in the latter day she shall rejoice. She opens her
mouth with wisdom, and the Verse 26.
law of Grace is in her tongue, etc.

Community of things betwixt couples works Amity, and Mine and Thine
betwixt them should not be heard. They are Yoke-fellowes, and (which is much
more) they are one, therefore their divided goods may not divide them, but what
the one has the other ought to have, and be joint possessours of whatsoever
God grants. Let not the man deny what is fit to his wife, for she has a
right; and let not the wife grudge her husband hers, for he has a
pre-eminence. If you put water into wine and the water be more, yet it is
still called wine; and even so the woman's portion put to the man's is called
his, although hers is the greater. If use be common and love hearty, for names
and titles of order and custom, wise couples will not contend to the quenching
of one sparkle of Love.

Lastly, an Houswifely care of her Family and all things belonging thereunto,
cleanliness, order, and such like, as it beautifieth a woman, so pleases it a
man, and the effect of it is love and liking. If these be not, the contrary
follows. For the first, we all know unless a getter without, have a keeper
within, he shall be like one that fills a vessel, at the other end whereof
one draws out as fast as he puts in. For the second, it both delights
and profits, things pleasing more that are fresh and well keept, and lasting
longer being not daily used. The third thing, order, what a praise it is, may
appear by the consideration of your grain only; what a thing it were, if all
sorts should be put together, Wheat, Rye, Oats, Barley, Pease, Beans, and
not every kind laid by it self, It would overthrow the use and good even of
all, or else procure a work to sever them again. These things then and such
like will work such Amity, Unity, and Love betwixt man and wife, that the
matter of Divorce shall never come in any question, no not in thought, by any
man endued with either piety or reason: Wherefore I have rather chosen briefly
to note them than to speak any thing of Divorces.

But what may some say? I have touched many things how a woman ought to behave
herself to work and continue liking in her husband, and I have said nothing
or little of the man's duty to the woman. Indeed it is true. First, and more I
have spoken of women, because as they are the weaker, so they are often the
workers of coffeehouse, either through wilfulness, or at the least through
want of care to do otherwise; but yet I acknowledge there is a Law also for
the man, which he should regard and not break, delivered in the Word, and
easily to be remembered by good minds. Be not as a Lion in thine own house
(says Ephesians, 4. 30.
Wise Syrach) nor oppress them that are under thee. Husbands love your wives
and be not bitter to them, (says Colos. 3. 19.
the Apostle Paul) and dwell with them (says S. Peter) as men of knowledge,
giving honor to the Women as the weaker vessels, even as they that are heirs
together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be interrupted. Her
parents and friends have committed her to thy trust, and she herself
forsaking father and mother and all the world, has given herself unto thee,
how then may she be used ill? so could S. Chrysostom reason. Hom. 26. in 1.
Cor. Arist. polit. 1. Ca. 1.
Aristotle himself being but a Heathen could find fault (and most justly)
with certain that made no other reckoning of their wives than of servants.
Shall a man contend with his wife? Non habet victoria laudem. There is no
praise in the victory, says One well. By ill dealing, Morbus non tollitur,
sed augetur and exasperatur, The disease is not taken away, but increased and
exasperated. Wherefore in old times, they did use at Marriages to place
Mercury by Venus, and the Goddesses of Eloquence Suadam and Oratias.
and delectable speech, to note that whatsoever married couples will obtain
one of the other, it must be done not by any unkind course, but by good
persuasion and loving speech. And when they offered sacrifice, they pulled out
the gall of the sacrifice and cast it away, to signify likewise that in
marriage no bitterness should be used. Thus are men also advised by all means to
loving carriage of themselves in all things toward their wives. Wherefore
since God commands it, and man persuades it, who is he regarding either God
or man that will forget it? Away then with all thoughts of Divorces, and as men
and women that make account of a Judgment day, let either part bear with the
weakness of the other, and abhor such crimes as should stir up to any
separation. God in mercy strengthen us all.

Amen.
CHAP. XIX.
THIS Chapter contains a The sum of this Chapter.
Repetition of Laws, formerly given and comprised in the Decalogue, to the end
that by this Second Rehearsal, they might both be better explaned and
received with greater care and regard of them. The first is general, Ye shall
be holy, Verse 2.
for I the Lord your GOD am holy: Where, by holiness is meant true piety
toward God, and just dealing toward our Neighbors in such measure as we are
able in this mortality to attain unto. For here we see but in part, know but
in part, and are regenerated but in part, being nevertheless ^ust by
imputation, and laboring Imputatione and inch(...)-one,
to perfection. These words are by Romish Teachers applied to Ministers, and
urged to prove that they ought not to marry. But does the Text here so say, or
you see with your eyes, that God speaks these words to all Israel, and Peter
aledging them in his Epistle 1. Pet. 1. 16.
applies them to all in general. If therefore they forbid Marriage as a
breach of Holiness, sure they must forbid it to all men and women as well as to
Ministers, But woe to that Doctrine that opposes Gods Ordinance to Holiness
when no unholiness can be ordained by him, and the end of Marriage is to
preserve holiness, and to abolish uncleanness both from man and woman. The
reason aledged, because our Heavenly Father is holy, should much move us. For
d^ we not see here among us daily, how they that serve wicked and ill disposed
men, will labor to please them even in evil? How much more then should we
with our best care endeavor to please him in holiness, that is most holy
himself, and will crown it with eternal comfort in us?

2 The reverence of Father and Mother, The keeping of the Sabbaths, The
avoiding of Idolatry and Verse 3. verse 4. Verse 5. verse 6. 7. 8.
Molten Gods, A free heart in all Offerings, and a due regard of commanded
circumstances in the same; these are all, Laws which have been spoken of
before, and therefore to that, and to my Treatise upon the Commandments I
refer you. In the 9. Verse you read thus, verse 9.
When you reap the harvest of your Land, you shall not reap every corner of
your field, neither shall thou gather the gleanings of thy Harvest. Thou shall
not gather verse 10.
the Grapes of the Vineyard clean, neither gather every grape of thy
Vineyard, but thou shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am
the Lord your God. A worthy Law, ever to teach us both what care the Lord has
of the poor, and what care we must have. If we have it there are many
blessings promised to it, if we want it, as fearful curses. Yet what
coldness possesses man's heart who sees not? But when the Lord commanded
something to be left in the field for was his meaning that of that which came
home and was put into the Barn, they should have nothing? No, no, both in the
Fields, and out of Barn and House, the poor must ever be remembered, if we
mean to hear that joyful Speech one day, When I was hungry you fed me, and
when I was naked you clothed me. But the LORD willed here precisely somewhat
to be left in the field because he knew our corruption which more hardly
parts with a thing already housed and brought in, than when it is yet
abroad in the Field. A Purse once tied upon knots will not easily Reclusa
semel difficilius retrahuntur, and C^umena multis nodis ligata disficilius
soluitur: Ergo in agro. etc.
open when it should; and therefore to meet with this hardness and to provide
the better for them he commands a care in the Field before it come in, and
yet expects the other too as need requires. O where is this care with
wolrdly men that rake and over rake their Fields with greedy mind to have even
the uttermost they can get from it, that gather their fruit so, as if they see
but one Apple left upon the tree, will rather set a Ladder of purpose to fetch
it down, than they will go without it? If any poor come, they are rated, and
reviled, and driven away, as if they were Dogs rather than Men and Women as
we be, Children of the same Father, Heirs of the same promises, and redeemed
with the same price, the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
Will God ever wink at this wickedness, and prosper these thus gotten goods
upon our posterity? Think of it but in reason, and tell me what your
conscience says? The Example of Boaz, God has left us in his Word for a good
Rule in this kind worthy a religious and careful following. Into whose Field
when Ruth came Ruth 2. 2.
to gleane a few ears of Corn for her relief and her Mother in law Naomi,
first an honest servant appointed over the Keapers (let all servants and
overseers mark it) gave her leave without rebuke and check. And then Boaz
himself coming called her, when he knew she was a poor Stranger, and said
unto her, Hear thou, daughter, go to no other field to gather, Verse. 8.
neither go here-hence, but abide here by my Maidens. Let thine eyes be upon
the field that they do reap, and Verse. 9.
go thou after the Maidens. Have I not charged the servants that they touch
thee not? Moreover when thou art a thirst, go unto the vessels and drink of
that which the servants have drawn. At the Meale-time come thou hither, Verse
14.
and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. He also bade his
servants not only to suffer her verse 15.
to gleane, but of purpose to let fall some of the sheaues for her that she
might take it. etc. Here is mercy and pity to a poor Stranger Chronicled up
in this Book of GOD, that his Fame may never dye who showed it, that it may
teach us that live, and that it may condemn all churlish greedy gripple
Natures to the worlds end. O, let it profit you, and let the poor man bow
before you and bless you for your comfort, as she did here to Boaz. Again,
forasmuch as harvest time is the time of your receiving at Gods hands a great
largess and bountiful Alms, your Fruits of Hay and Corn, of Grapes and all
good gatherings, therefore at that time especially the hand that receives
should give, thankfully toward God, feelingly in it self, and cheerfully
toward the poor receiver. So, so should all be well, and God both give more
and prosper upon posterity what he gives, which otherwise by all the Lawyers
in the world, and all the perpetuities in the world cannot be so tied to your
seed, but that God will blow both it and them away. And when we thus speak
of giving the poor their part, do you think God his own part must be
imbesseled and taken away, I mean your due and true tithe? No, no, if the
creature must not be defrauded, much less must Mal. 3. 8. 9. 10
the Creator be robbed. Read the Prophets words, and pray for a feeling heart
and an open hand according to duty and right. I cannot forbear to tell you
(in this Note well.
place) of a fearful Judgment of God, showed not many years ago in these
parts, upon a greedy grudger of his Tithe to them, to whom it was by Law due.
A Gentleman of good sort, our neighbor hereby and well known to all this
Country, had the tithes of a Parsonage, and by the right thereof demanded
wool, of a man also rich, and the Owner of many hundreds of sheep. This
hard-hearted man sent a small quantity, the servants showed it their Master.
He willed upon the Holy Day next it should be brought to the Church that the
neighbors might see it, who all upon sight knew the wrong. The Gentleman
demanded his due; the other denied any more, and withal vowed in choler out
of a naughty heart, that if he were forced to pay any more, he would never
keep any more sheep, but deprive him of that profit from him. The Law
forced him, and he thereupon put away his sheep, euer-after falling so in
decay (GOD following of him with his wrath for his wicked mind) that the day
when the Gentleman was buried (being not very long after) he among the rest of
poor people, stood to receive such Alms as was given at the Funerals. Let it
strike, O let it move us to think with our selves what it is to grudge God
his Tithe, or any man his due in this sort, to whom the Laws we live under
justly give it, and ever pray we against a naughty heart choked and poisoned
with the love of this world above all care to be saved in the great and
fearful day.

3 The Law against stealing has an explanation Verse 11.
here added worthy marking in these words, Neither deal falsely, nor lie one
to another; as if he should have said, Mistake not the matter of stealing,
neither judge better of your selves than there is cause, but know it ever for a
truth that although you break no houses nor rob upon the way, etc. Yet if
you deal falsely one with the other in Buying and Selling or any way, and lie
one to an other by affirming it cost so and so, or by denying any thing
committed to your credit and custody, assure your self you are a stealer and
guilty of that Commandment, Thou shall not steal. An other Branch
follows in the thirteenth Verse, The Workemans verse 13.
hire shall not tarry with thee till the Morning; whereof read Deutronomie the
four and twenty: And Syrach 34. For this also is stealth and a great stealth
little thought of, to rob the poor Labourer of his hi^e. God grant it be
not found in many that make great show of Religion, great Gentlemen, great
Merchants, great Clothiers, etc. Never is the poor Workman brought low
enough, never is his payment slow enough. Shall not God visit for these
things? Think of it more, and be well assured you cannot think of it too
much. Job says his land cried not against Job 31. 16.
him, neither the furrows thereof complained together. Take heed it be so with
you in your land, in your merchandise, in your clothing: Let them not cry, for
their cry is shrill and fearful. You may sow and an other eat for this
wickedness, and your plants be clean rooted out. Job says (and do you
mark it as you fear your God) If I restrained the poor of their desire, Or
have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, Or have Verse 17.
eaten my morsels alone, and the fatherless have not eaten thereof, (For from
my youth he has grown up Verse 18.
with me as with a Father and from my mothers womb I have been a guide unto
her) If I have seen Verse. 19.
any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering, If his ioynes
have not blessed me, because Verse. 20.
he was warmed with the Fleece of my sheep, If I Verse 21.
have lift up mine hand against the fatherless, When I saw I might help him
in the gate: Then let mine Verse 22.
arm fall from my shoulder and mine arm be broken from the bone. How much
less then would Job pinch and wring and grind the faces of poor men that
worked for him and his, of poor widows and children that rise up early and
go late to bed, eating the bread of carfulness, and giving away their
beloved sleep, all to make him rich, and his house gay, and his posterity
strong; O how much less, I say again, would he have pinched them and
twitched them either by an unconscionable price for their work, or by an ill
payment? You see it, you must mark it, and to your soul I leave it.

4 Thou shall not curse the deaf, neither put a Verse 14.
stumbling Block before the blind, but shall fear thy GOD: I am the LORD. It
was ever esteemed a Barbarous erueltie to insult over a man's imperfection and
the Children of GOD must beware it. By the Deaf, here are also meant men and
women absent, who though they could hear being present, yet being not there,
they are deaf and hear not. Such should not be cursed, that is evil spoken
of, because they are not present to hear and answer. GOD (you see) hates and
forbids this wrong, and as many as are Gods, will forbear it for their
good. Base and bad persons spend their time in carping, slaundering, and ill
reporting as though they were so much better by how much they make others
worse. So did Saint Augustine that worthy Father Quisquis amat dictis absentum
rodere vitam, Hanc mensam vetitam noutrit esse silis.
abhor this vice, that over his Table where he dyned he worte two Verses,
to tell all them that sat with him, if they carped at any person absent, that
Table was not for them, nor they Guests welcome to him. By the Blind are also
meant such as are ignorant and unskillful in any thing, as an ignorant Buyer,
Learner, Trader, etc. Before whose eyes you may not lay a stumbling Block,
deceyuing them either by False Doctrine, Badde Life, crafty cunning, or the
like. For as pitiful or more is the blindness of mind, as the blindness of
body, and therefore, any way to abuse the one or the other by Qu^ quis
deb(...)r, eo per te sit tutior. Verse 15.
stumbling blocks, is hateful and damnable.

5 Ye shall not do unjustly in judgment. Thou shall not favor the person of
the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty, but thou shall judge thy
Neighbor justly. A good law against a great evil in the Commonwealth,
touched before in Exodus, whether you may turn and see the evil. Who can be
safe in life or limb, Exodus 23. 3.
in lands or goods, if Affection be Judge. Booteth it to be honest or just, or
blameles if not Truth, but Fancy try me? No, no. And therefore blessed be God
for Law and Justice, and woe to the Land where Affection rules. Honestius est
cum iudicaueris amare, quam cum amaueris iudicare. It is far better to love
when thou have judged, than to judge when thou love. Clamat pauper and nullus
exaudit, clamat dives and quilibet applaudit: The poor man cries, and no man
hears, the rich man cries, and every man prayseth and smootheth. O heavy
Countries case where thus it is. Do the thing that is just therefore to rich
and poor, and that shall give thee peace at the last. Honored men may be for
their wealth, and feared greatly for their strength; but only justice is that
which gets love, and a good report with all men that can speak well for any
cause, and have not sold their tongues and souls too, unto envy.

6 Thou shall not walk about with tales among thy verse 16.
people. Thou shall not stand against the blood of thy Neighbor, I am the
Lord. Both these are branches of Read Ezekiel 22. 9.
murder, and in the Commandment see more of them. A great mischief in either
Kingdom, Country, or House, is a babbling tale-teller, and he that is wise
will beware him. It is a shrewde blow that kills three at a blow, and that
not in body only, but in soul also. The tale-teller kills himself, and
peradventure twenty more that hear him, and rashly thereupon condemn the
innocent. The spirit of God stirs up David that Holy Psalm. 12. 3.
man, to beg of God, that he would root out all such deceiptfull lips and
tongues that speak proud things. Deceiptfull lips are those that speak
smoothly and think wickedly, and those also that speak falsely and
slanderously of their brethren. Both shall be rooted out in time, but til then
they vex the souls of those that deserve it not at their hands.

7 But what if I be so wise, that I can hold my Verse 17.
tongue from speaking evil, and yet secretly hate him in my heart? See what
follows in your Chapter, Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy heart, but
thou shall plainly rebuke thy neighbor and suffer him not to sin. Secret
hate then is murder of the heart, and against the Commandment. Use it
therefore at your peril, and say God either sees not or regards not; Your
judgment at last shall teach you, he does both. For this Law is not idle, nor
any Law, He gives to the sons of men.

8 Thou shall not avenge, says the next Law; and Verse 18.
why? In another place we read, For vengeance is mine and I will repay. Wrest
not Gods sword therefore out of his hand, sit not down in his seat, and make
thy self a God for fear of the end. Well, let him go then, I will not
avenge, but sure I will remember him, forgive I may, but never forget, etc. See
what follows in the very next words of this Verse, Neither shall Loco
diuitiarum, quidam odia sua fili^s relinqunt. Deadly fend.
thou be mindful of a wrong against the children of thy people. Remembering
then, you see, is condemned as well as auenging, and therefore it stands you
upon, both to forgive and to forget, or else the Lord shall forget you, out of
his Book of life. Nay see more, all this is not yet enough, but we must love
also our Neighbors and that even as our selves, or else we perish. For I am the
Lord, (says the Verse) that is, one that sees, and hates. and will smite
thee in that strength that thou can not resist nor endure. Foolish Politic,
think then of piety, and abhor that poli^ie that deuoureth piety and
destroys thee, Thou can not live ever, but must die and come unto judgment.

9 Thou shall not let thy cattle gender with others of diverse kinds. Thou
shall not sow thy field with mingled verse 19.
seed, neither shall a garment of diverse things, as linen and woollen, come
upon thee. God will have his creatures used in their kind as he has created
them, and his ordinance neither overthrown, nor corrrected. With diverse seeds
they sow their ground, which follow diverse doctrines in Religion. And linen
and woollen garments are forbidden, either because the Gentiles used them, to
whom God would not have his people like, or to note, how hateful to GOD is a
fantastical head carried about with toys and idle devises. He that is a Papist
here and a Protestant there, he that takes part with both sides in a
quarrel or matter worldly, as a plea of law or such like, you may rightly
think odious A Linsey woolsey Lawyer. Verse 20.
by this Law, etc.

10 Whosoever medleth with a woman that is a bondmayd affianced to a husband,
and not redeemed nor freedom given her, he shall be scourged, but they shall
not dye, because she is not made free, etc. With God there is no respect of
bond or free, but in seats of Justice and execution of punishments there is,
and ought to be great difference, because there comes not so much hurt to the
Commonwealth by one as by another. The Law of the free woman you had in
Exodus 22. 16. And least any should think this fault to be little, because
they are but scourged, there is a sacrifice appointed to make an atonement, so
showing that it is a sin not to be done Verse (...).
away but by Christ. And as well does fornication shut out from the Kingdom of
God as Adultery. 1. Cor. 6.


11 Also when ye shall come into the Land and shall have planted every tree for
meat you shall count the fruit thereof uncircumcised three years, and it
shall not be eaten, etc. A merciful providence for posterity: for if a Tree
be suffered to bear too soon, as the first, second, or third year, it does
not usually endure long, but decays sooner than otherwise it would, the
fruit draws away the nourishment which should make the root and tree
strong. Secondly, it rest rained Covetousness in the Jews; and taught them
how God hates scraping all to a man's self for his time, and nothing careing
for posterity. Such are they that will take the heart out of land before their
term end, cut down the wood, fruit trees, hedges, destroy the game, and
do all the mischief they can and dare do. The LORD sees them and thinks
of them, though they little think of themselves, and of their malicious
actions. Thirdly, it shadowed how little worth the fruits of youth usually are
either to the Church or Commonwealth, till years have bred strength of
judgment, and made them both see and do what is profitable. Even as
uncircumcised fruits: Psalm. 26.
so are the Actions of youth, and therefore David prayed for pardon in this
case.

12 But the fourth year all the fruits thereof shall verse 24.
be holy to the praise of the LORD. And in the fifth verse 25.
year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, etc. Three years they must
forbear, to suffer the fruit to grow as near as they could, to the end the
tree might be strong and endure to posterity, The fourth must now be
consecrated to the LORD, And the fifth they might begin to eat. This
Consecration of one year to the Lord, shows how due from man, and accepted
of God, true and hearty thankfulness is. Secondly, that God Deuteronomy. 26.
would have them acknowledge the fruits of trees, as well as of the earth by
corn, to proceed of Gods goodness, mercy, and providence, without all
desert or merit of theirs. Thirdly, that they were to use them as all other his
good gifts, soberly, temperately, and orderly, not ryotously and wantonly, as
too many now a days do giving so, and so much for a few Cherries, or such
like, when there is no cause in Physic for health, or so forth: but only
wantonness and luxury, little thinking how vile themselves are, if God should
look upon them in Justice, or how many needy naked souls, as dear to God as
they, want, and would be glad of one penny or half penny of that money so
wantonly without cause bestowed upon their belly.

13 Ye shall not eat the flesh with the blood; ye shall not use Witchcraft,
nor observe times. The first Part Verse 26.

flying. And neither of these is forbidden, as far as their is any natural
reason and cause, which is in fore-shewing of rain and tempests, and
alteration of weather. For example, long observation has found it, and good
writers agree of it, that the continual crying of the night Owl all the night
long, prognosticateth death: ye gathering together of many Ravens playing and
crying, foretell fair weather: Chickens crying loud, Et studiose quaerentes
pedunculos.
Swallows flying about the waters and pooles crying, show it will be rain.
etc. These and the like may be observed, and it is lawful wisdom, no offense
at all. But either by flying or crying, to gather Argument of good success or
ill in your actions, and busynes, this is wicked and damnable, and therefore
the Art and skill pretended of such wizards unlawful, what feats soever they

of these toys. Josephus tells how one Mosselanus a Jew a valyant Soldier
in the camp of Alexander the great, when the march suddenly stayed, asking
what was the cause, was told, that it was to take notice by such a Foul,
sheewing the Foul, whether they should go for-ward or no, for if she took her
flight before them, then should they march on, if not, then return: wherewith
he mightly displeased, saying nothing, took his bow, and with an arrowe
presently struck the Foul dead. Whereat when the Southsayer and many of the
Host were offended, he answered, that it was a foul shame for so many worthy
men, to seek knowledge of her, that knew not what should happen to herself.
For if she had, she would not have come there, or not sitten til he had shot:
and so the matter was laughed out, and the fear gone. Augustus Caesar was
wont to make a great observation of it, if his left shoe came in stead of his

here. Only superstitious observations, devised by man seduced by Satan,
without any Christian or natural reason are here prohibited, and must of us
still be abhorred, in which kind the Heathens abounded for want of knowledge.
Remember the 28. of Deuteronomy. To fear God rightly and truly, and then blessed at

neither shall thou mar the tufts of thy beard. Many times it has been noted
how careful the Lord was, not to have his people imitate the fashions of the
Gentiles, for fear one thing will draw on another, and in the end even
Idolatry and false worship. We in these days are wholely given to foreign
fashions, the Lord in mercy save us from foreign superstition, and continue
his Gospel and peace upon Israel, preventing and confounding their purposes
that craftily endeavor the supplanting of both Truth and Peace, under the
color of policy and safety, etc. The cutting and marking of their flesh was
also Heathenish.

15 Thou shall not make thy daughter common, to cause her to be a whore, least
the land also fall to whoredom, Verse 29.
and the Land be full of wickedness. This is a Branche of the Commandment
against Adultery, admonishing Parents to look to their houses, and
Magistrates to look to the Land, that there be no Stews, nor places of sin
suffered for any color whatsoever, as is in Rome for gain, even an yearly
Revenue. The power of Satan over Heathens in this matter was fearful, and
therefore the Lord admonishes his people to beware of their fashions and
sins. The Cyprij (say our Books) before the marriage of their daughters and
maidens, appointed certain days and places when and where they were to come
together, so to raise a dowry and marriage portion for them. The Locrenses
thought it was a way to please their gods, to prostitute their Uirgins, and
therefore in any distress and danger of war and the like, they would make
vows, that if they might have victory and be delivered, so and so many
maidens, upon a solemn Feast appointed for that purpose, should be
prostituted. These horrible things serve to show us the corruption of our
nature, and the blindness entered into our understanding by the first fall, till
God renew us by his holy Spirit, and give us the light of his Word, as also to
stir us up to thankfulness to our most gracious God for better knowledge
vouchsafed to us, whereby we are kept from being such beasts and monsters, as
these Heathens were, and men still are, without him.

16 You shall not regard them that work with spirits, Verse 31.

said in the Commandment against Witches etc.

Commandment, for these old men are in stead of Fathers. And therefore the
Apostle wills them to be exhorted a^ Fathers. Again, 1. Tim. 5. 1.
old Age is a blessing of God, and therefore it should be reverenced. The
contempt of it, is the contempt of God and so taken by him, as these words
show here, and dread thy God. This honor to be done to them, must also
teach them so to live and behave themselves, as they may be worthy of all
honor and reverence.

18 And if a stranger soiourne with you in your land, verse 33. verse 34.

Strangers in the land of Egypt etc. A gracious God thus every way to meet
with our corruption, and to restrain it by his wise and holy laws. He
knows, and we should learn, to feel the aching heart in a stranger that is
out of his Country and far from his frindes, wanting many things that he is
ashamed to speak of, and knows not how to get them. Therefore not further to
be verid with our churlish and unkind words or deeds. But we to remember the
old saying, Aut sumus, aut fuimus, possumus esse quod hic est: Either we are,
or have been, or may be that which he is. God make us thankful for his
comforts.

19 Ye shall not do unjustly in Judgment, in Line, Verse. 35. Verse. 36.

shall not enjoy, and therefore truth is best. These are the Laws of a
righteous God, and we must regard them, if ever we mean to be regarded of
him. Happy shall we be if we do it: And let this suffice of this Chapter.

THis Chapter repeateth Laws mentioned before, adding punishments The sum of
this Chapter.
to the breakers of them, which before was not done. It shall not therefore be
needful to go over them all again particularly, but leave you to confer
them your self, which you may do by help of the quotations in the Margent of
your Bible, referring you to the former places where the same Laws were
mentioned, without addition of that punishment which here now is laid down.
Only for order sake, I will give you these few observations.

1 In laying down several pains and punishments for the breakers of his
Laws, the Lord teaches that Commonwealths and governments do stand and are
preserved, as well by punishments of the evil, as by rewards of the good, and
that as needful therefore is the one as the other. If either reward or good
examples of such as love obedience would serve, it were best, but it never
would, nor will, the lesser part being ever so led, and the greater by fear of
pains. The saying is old and true, It is as great a virtue to keep what is
gotten, as first to get it; and even so, is it as good a duty in a Magistrate
to see Laws kept, as at first to make them. And since they will not be kept of
all without punishments, therefore punishments are most necessary. Idle then
and absurd was it in those Heretics, that argued God not to be Author of the
Old Testament, because there are so many punishments mentioned and executed.
For is it a fault in a Surgeon to cut of a corrupt part for the saving of
the whole? So in the Magistrate, it is no cruelty but virtue to prefer the
safety of many before the will and liking of one.

2 The punishments here threatened and appointed for Idolatry and Idolaters is
very worthy noting. Whosoever (says GOD) shall give his children to Molech,
Verse 2.
(an Idol of the Ammonites, as you saw before, unto whom they burned and
sacrificed their children 2. Kin. 23. Verse 10. and by this one kind, the Lord
understands all kinds of Idolatry) that person shall the people of the land
stone to death. But what if they be negligent? see the severity of God
against this sin. Then will I (says God) set my face against that man, and
Verse 3. verse 4.
cut him off from among his people; Yea, I say again, If the people of the
Land hide their eyes and wink at that offender, and kill him not, then will I
set my face against Verse 5.
that man and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a
whoring after him, etc. Why Lord, why so? Because he has defiled my
Sanctuary and polluted my holy Name. See, in these terms, the nature of
Idolatry: yet there is mercy with the Lord, and great patience. Tempt him not
therefore, but meditate of these Examples. Solomon fell to Idolatry, and what
a judgment did God show upon his house in his sons entrance: Rehoboam, by
cutting off for ever from him ten of the Tribes? Manasses was an Idolater, the
people followed him, and what did the Lord to him, till he saw his fall and was
most sorry for it? The whole state of the Jews, how was it over thrown for
this wickedness? Read that notable Chapter of Jeremy the Prophet Iere:
from yt 28. verse forward. It is true may some say, Idolatry grievously
offends God, but what is Idolatry? Let that person know, that every worship
not commanded of God is Idolatry, and the worship also that is commanded, if
it be done in other manner then is commanded. To make it plain, the worshipping
of God in and under yt similitude of a golden Calfe was therefore Idolatry,
because God commanded and appointed no such thing, were their intent never so
good, and their distinction betwixt God and the calfe never so plainly made.
Again, to offer those sacrifices which the law appointed, and by God were
commanded, with affiance in yt out-ward work done, was Idolatry, because in
a thing commanded they did not use the manner commanded. So, so, (and God make
it enter) is the reading of Lessons of Scripture, saying of Prayers, singing of
Psalms, Fasting, and such like, very offensive to God and plain Idolatry,
when they are used with an opinion of merit, and the Lord Jesus robbed by them
of that praise that is only due to him, for meriting our reconciliation with
God and eternal salvation. Beware, beware we then how we kindle the wrath of
him against us, that has here vowed to set his face against such persons to
cut them off and their Families also with them, although the Magistrate wink,
and will not see what the Lord has willed him both to see, and to punish. Yea,
the Lord will himself be revenged both of doer and sufferer, be he Father,
Husband, Master, Magistrate or whatsoever, bound by place and Office to look
to such things and to reform them. And therefore beware of winking at, and
suffering what you are able to amend. Great is the good that a willing
Superior may do, although nor ever what he would, through the envy and
practices of some that should not hinder. For it is true, that either
sincerely, or at least seemingly inferiors will frame to his will that is over
them: And seemingly I say, because all is not ever gold that glistereth. And I
remember when certain Ambassadors praised the Lacedemonian soldiers for
being so orderly, who before had been so injurious, one of them answered, No,
no; the praise is Nos ijdem sumus qui and nuper, sed alius nunc dux est and.
Xenophon.
not ours that we are thus changed, for we are the same men still, but we
have now another Captain, and he it is that orders us, etc. Thus go over
your Chapter, and see the several punishments annexed to every law, and fear
his wrath that is so strong and just.

CHAP. XXI.
Three principal Heads are contained in this Chapter. The Priests mourning for
the dead. His Marriage. His bodily qualities.


COncerning the first, the Priests in the Law might not lament and mourn for
every one, but for such as here are mentioned, Namely, His kins-man that is
near unto him, by his mother, or by his father, or by his son, or by his
daughter, or by his brother, or by his sister; a maid that is near unto him
which has not had an husband, for her he may lament, etc. The drift of this
whole matter in short, was to restrain them from such Heathenish fashions as
were then used among the Gentiles round about Cic. Tusc. 3.
them, who used to cut themselves, to tear their clothes, to beat their
heads, and foolishly many ways to use themselves. In the 19. Chapter before,
this was touched. Ezekiel. 44. you may read of it and in the 6. of Baruch,
directly contrary to this Law did the Priests mourn. Yet even Gentiles did see
the folly of much of this, as Bion his speech shows, who tested at Agamemnons
furious pulling of his hair, and said he pluked it of, as though baldness
were an excellent remedy to aswage grief.

2 That of following his sisters Funeral not married, and not following if
she were married, was not to derogate any thing from that holy Ordinance of
God, but because his sister married, was ingrafted into another house and
family, and so was not the next of kin in that respect.

3 The high Priest might neither follow father nor mother, nor any. A thing
that God would have to distinguish the Priests among themselves, and so to
show how he not only likes and allows of degrees among the^, but even he
makes the same degrees, and appoints some higher, and some lower, and some
to do this, others not to do that, that reverence may be among themselves
one to another, and of all the people to them all. Allegorically this restraint
of the High Priest from that which was then a legal pollution, noted, that in
Christ was no spot, nor blot, nor pollution of any sort whatsoever. And the
suffering of others to go, that in them also touching themselves, there was
original corruption as well as in others, howbeit their Office was more
excellent, and gave them pre-eminence above other men. Popish priests say,
their Priesthood was shadowed by this in the Law, yet they use shauing, and
going to Funerals, etc.

2.
Of the Second Point concerning their Marriage, your Chapter says. They shall
not take to wife an Whore, or one polluted, neither shall they marry a woman
divorced from her husband, for such a one is holy unto his GOD. Thou shall
sanctify him therefore, for he offers the bread of thy GOD, he shall be holy
unto the etc. All which things are thus laid down to give credit to his
Office and function, and to shadow out that the Church, which is the Spouse of
the great High Priest Christ Jesus, is and should be without wrinkle, a chaste
Virgin, holy and undefiled by imputation through Christ. If Marriage had been
such an unfit thing for the Priests, the Lord could as easily have simply
forbidden them to marry at all, as thus to have limited them what manner of
women they should marry. But never shall they see, whom God in wrath has
blinded. How plainly here does God require reverence to them and magnifieth
their Office, that they offered the bread of God and were holy, yet married;
but I will not enter into this matter, it has been touched before that
Marriage ever was honorable among all men and the bed undefiled. And Let every
man have his wife and every woman her husband etc. The heaven and earth were
ashamed (when time was) of their holiness that under the color of holiness,
forbad marriage, and the Lords wrath is upon the houses where they dwelt to
this day, etc.

3.
The Third Point concerning bodily qualities in the Priests, begins in your
Chapter here at the 17. verse making exceptions against all blemishes, and
particularly making mention of diverse, which may not be so taken, as if God
respected the outward favor and personage of any man. For when Samuel went to
anoint David, and saw the elder brother a goodly tall man, thinking in
himself, this is he, GOD plainly told him, He looked not as men do, upon
the out-ward Primum ipsa spe us(...) gra impe^io fuit, nunc (...) (...)am
a(...)a Sacerdotio. (...). 36. C. illiteratos. Vide quomodo hanc pae^e^og^am,
Pon(...)sices ^am sub Euange(...)o obtrud^^e velint, cum haec lex quoad lit
teram nihil ad nos. Did. 49. C. hinc etenim de animi vitijs.
show, and therefore bad him not look upon the same. But this was done to
preserve the dignity of the calling in that infancy of the Church, which
otherwise might have come into contempt, together with the holy things they
dealt withal, for the contemptible show of the Priests. Yet thus much w^^ may
learn by it further, that if these infirmities of body which they could not
help, made them unfit then to be Priests unto the Lord, may not now, wilful
impiety being a blot in soul and mind, disable a man from being a Minister
to God in his own conscience, although he have the outward calling of men?
Yes, yes, and that will some know one day, that think full well of themselves
now, and sit in judgment upon their brethren, despising in a hautie pride all
that they do, and dee(...)ing no men worth any thing but themselves, when
indeed there is no man less worth then themselves.

2 Yet for out-ward feature and comeliness of body if it may be had, it is
the blessing of a good GOD, and more acceptable is (says the old Proverb)
Virtue coming Gratior est pulchro veniens in corpore virtus.
in a comely body. Example might be showed both in Ecclesiastical men and
temporal. But if it cannot be had, good Ministers must be preferred rather
than fine. According to that which we read of the men of Sparta, who when
Agesilaus was desired to be their Captain that were mustred out against ye^
Persians, being in deed very fit for war, but lame of one foot, they long
consulted, whether they should hearken to that desire or no, but at last
concluded, that it was better the Captain should be lame of a foot, then the
Army of a Captain, and so let him go. Even in the like sort may it truly
be said, it is better that a good Minister should want an eye or such like,
then that the Church should want a good Minister.

ble^ishes here mentioned, to the vices and blemishes of our minds. As, blind

is he, who seeing whither he should go, yet is not able through weakness
of mind to go thither, but faints, and fails, stumbleth and trippeth in
his going, and comes short of his right end. To whom may be applied that of
the Apostle, Lift up your hands which hang down and your weak knees, and make
straight steps unto your feet, least that which is halting be turned out of
the way, etc. Hebr. 12. 12. By a flat-nose may be noted a weakness in
discretion and A flat nose.
judgment, because the nose discerns good savors from evil, as the mind
should also do things fit and unfit. In the Canticles among the praises of the
Spouse, It is said, her nose is like a Tower in Libanon, because by Cant. 7. 4.
judgment she discerns a far of temptation and evils coming, as out of a
Tower. There are some again that are too quick and busy, searching and
prying further into many matters then they should, and so by their busy
factions, and seditious heads, by their turbulent and unquiet wits,
overthrowing the praise of their actions, and these are said to have great
noses or A great Nose.
crooked* a blenish and that a great one, unfit for all men, but most foul in
a Priest, and therefore such not admitted to the Altar of GOD. In these days,
what outcries by the Secular Priests against the Jesuits for this unquiet
humor are ^ublished, you cannot but understand. They are therefore not so fit
for the ALTAR as for the old Proverb, Busy must have a band, and ouer-busie
must be hanged. By broken foot or hand, such as have no goodness at A broken

all in them, not lame as before, but flat without. A crooked back has he,
who is bowed and pressed down with the care of earthly things, so that he
looks not up to heaven and future joys; but if he hear any thing thereof,
presently the other plucketh him to his bias again, like to that seed sown
in stony ground which is choked by earthly and worldly cares. A bleared eye
has he, who having some sense and knowledge of good things, yet by an ill
custom of bad behavior is diuerted and overthrown. For in bleared eyes, the
candle or sight of the eye is said to be good, but by a bad humor distilling
down, the eye-liddes are hurt and made out of order, so grieuing and hindering
the sight of the eye. A Blemish in his eye he is said to have, who puffed up
with pride and arrogancy, sees not indeed what he is, but as a sight that is
able to see, by a white-skinne growing over is hindered; so a man able to see
and discern good things for his wisdom, learning, and good natural parts,
through a vile whiteness growing in his eye, that is, a proud conceit in his
mind of his whiteness above other men, is made stark blind, and foolish,
and absurd to all wisemen. To such therefore it is good counsel which the
Lord gives, To annoint the eyes with eye-salue that they may see, etc. The
Skiruie is a heat coming from Apoc. 3. 18.
the Inwards to the out-ward skin, and therefore such men noted, as have
inward concupisence and heat breaking forth into the outward act of
uncleanness, most unfit for such as are and ought to be holy unto GOD. The
Scabbe, is a foulness arising of an Itche, and spreading broader and greater
if it be not looked unto, and thereby is noted the vice of Covetousness, which
first begins with an itching desire, and afterward for want of looking to,
spreads to a great foul vice deforming any man, and most unseemly in a
Priest, who ought to be clean. Covetousness, (says the Apostle) is the
root of all evil. Lastly, by him that has his stones broken, such are noted
as though they do not the act, yet have ever in their minds, lewd and
unclean thoughts, whereby they are so sinfully carried away, as pure and
clean and holy Meditations can take no place. A fruit too well known to
grow from forced chastity: This burning fire of Hell in any man is damnable,
and therefore our gracious GOD has provided a remedy. In a man consecrated to
God to meditate in his Word day and night, it is mostodious. And therefore for
no worldly respects to be suffered by the contempt of Gods Ordinance, if God
vouchsafe not the gift of Continency, which is a virtue in the mind, and not
an outward restraint of the body only. Cursed are those policies that destroy
both body and soul in hellfire. These are the blemishes mentioned in your
Chapter, which GOD would not have in his Priests, and therefore such as had
them, were not admitted to his Altar. How learned men have labored to apply
them to moral virtues you see, and it is very certain, that such vices of the
mind, as have been noted, neither then were, nor now are for such as offer the
bread of God, but are to be prayed against and taken heed of, to the
uttermost strength that God gives, yet happily not intended by the Law. And
therefore, I rather like to leave these applications as the conceits of men,
and to learn by all these blemishes forbidden, that the Jews were then
taught, (which we have also learned and believe) how no mortal man could be
able to work our peace and reconciliation with God, but only Christ Jesus.
For in all men are some or other blemishes, and it became us to Heb. 7. 2^.
have such an High Priest as is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
sinners, and made higher then the Heavens, etc. In him then there was no
blemish but he was the imaculate Lamb of GOD, able to save us, willing to save
us with the best blood he had, and he has thus saved all those that believe
on him, and we reject all other Saviors whatsoever. This was certainly the
drift of this Law, and therefore we may boldly gather this fruit from it.

Lastly, these persons having such blemishes, albeit they might not perform
this duty, to stand at the Aitar; yet were they allowed to eat of the
sacrifices and such things as the Priests did eat of, and allowed to be in
the Congregation: so say some, shadowing that the Church although blemished,
nevertheless is admitted to the communion and participation of those things,
which Christ by his eternal sacrifice has obtained for it. And my self would
gather this comfort from it, that albeit some one or other infirmity may
justly disable me for such a place either in the Church or Commonwealth; yet
from a place with the elect, either here, or for ever, it shall not hinder
me: No, ten thousand blemishes, nor any blemishes shall hinder me, if grieved
with them, and fighting against them, as the Lord enableth me, I take hold of
my spotless Savior, as my help and safety against them all. Thus then do
you meditate of this Chapter, and be bettred by it, reading it over with these
Notes, and praying in your heart for the help of his working spirit, to make
the Word profitable unto you. My labor is but to draw you to read by a taste,
and to pray that God may work with you further then my Labors. The Word being
a Well, the bottom whereof no man can come so unto, but there will be still
more water to draw.

CHAP. XXII.
Having in the former Chap. noted what should hinder from the Ministry, now
it pleases the LORD to note, what should disable them to eat of the holy
things, mencioning again such uncleannesses in men, as before in other
Chapters of this Book were mentioned. If this question arise in your mind,
why God having before forbidden all men that had these pollutions to eat of
holy things, should not again particularly forbid the Priests? answer is
made, because men in any authority and place are often apt to exempt them
themselves by one excuse or other from such obedience, as they are content
others should be bound unto. The Lord also threaneth punishment to the
breakers of this Law, that fear may restrain, where love will not.

2 The particular uncleannesses I will not go over here, but leave you to
look back to the 7. Chapter, the 13. and 15. Chapters, with such like. Thus
much do you note again, and let it be eueryours, that polluted sinners
remaining in their uncleanness without remorse and amendment, have no right
to the merits of Christ, but shall dye and perish in their filthiness. Cleansed
therefore we must be by newness of life and Faith in Christ Jesus, that we may
be saved.

3 The Stranger is forbidden to eat, etc. Verse 10. to tell us the state of
Turks, Heathens and Infidels till the Lord reduce them to his fold. To prevent
covetousness in the Priests by selling and contempt of holy things, by being so
common.

of CHRIST his Sacrifice being without all fault. Secondly, what living
Sacrifices holy and acceptable unto GOD we ought to be. 1. Pet. 2. and Romans

his Ministers, Namely, our better, not our worst, as now adays is used. Mal. 1.

the holy Feasts and Days observed of the Jews by GOD his appointment,
either weekly, or yearly. Weekly, as the Sabbath, Yearly, as the Feasts of
Easter, of Trumpets, of Tabernacles, of Penticost, etc. Of all which in Exodus
23. Numb. 28. and 29. and Deuteronomy. 16.

1 These feasts, you may see, were in remembrance, for the most part, of some
benefits and mercies of God, and therefore plainly teach us, what a due duty
from us to God it is, to remember carefully and thankfully his loving favors
showed unto us at any time, upon any occasion. Thou shall show thy Son, says
God, in Exodus 13. 14. etc.
that day, saying, this is done, because of that which the Lord did unto me
when I came out of Egypt. And it shall be a sign unto thee upon thine hand,
and for a remembrance between thine eyes, etc. Likewise those stones commanded
to be set up by Joshua, they shall serve (says God) for a sign among you, that
when your children Joshua 4. 6. 7.
shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, what mean you by these
stones, then ye may answer them, when the Arc passed through Jordan, the
waters were cut of, and these stones are a memorial for ever of the same.
David knowing this to be a due duty, cries to his soul to praise God and
never to forget his benefits. Psalm. 103. 2. Psalm. 105. 5.
And to others, to remember the marvelous works that he has done, his
wonders, and the judgments of his mouth. A thankful remembrance works
love, and desire to please God, but other fruits come of forgetfulness as you
may see, Psalm 78. Verse 7. 8 9. 10. 11. Beneficiorum dei memoria, Magistra
advitam. The remembrance of Gods benefits is the Mistres of good life, said
Saint Chrysostom in his time. And Dona dei, bona non sunt, nisi dei esse
confiteamur. The gifts of God are not good, except we acknowledge them to come
from God, said Saint Augustine.

2 In that they were called the Feasts of the Lord, verse 2.
Men were taught in them to seek and attend such things as belonged to God,
and not their own matters, pleasures and sports, etc. To this end still are
Holy Days kept, and therefore think of the right use of them.

3 When he says, It is the Sabbath of the Lord in all verse 3.
your dwellings: Learn (says S. Augustine) that no place priuiledgeth thee to
break Gods Law, but as being a sinner wheresoever thou go, thou carriest
the yoke of sin, so being the sernant of God, in all places obey his will etc.

4 When they are called holy Conuocations, think verse 4.
in your conscience, whether gadding, and riotting, and wanton dancing, with
such like, be holy exercises and meet for a holy convocation.

5 For the Feast of the Sabbath, in the Commandment it is handled, and thither
I refer you. It had use to preserve the Doctrine of Creation against all idle
Philosophers dreams of an Eternity. To confirm Faith in the Article, Maker
of Heaven and earth, and to refute all heretical assertions touching the same.
To be a refreshing to the bodies both of man and beast, which without rest
cannot endure. To give time for men to serve God, who all the weeke-long, and
ever does serve them. Finally to prefigure, and in some sort to lay before us,
our assured eternal rest in Heaven, when the Esaias 55. Hebr. 4.
six days of this life shall end, and that joyful seventh day shall come.

6 The Feast of the Passover or Easter you know was Verse 5.
keept in remembrance of their diliuerance out of Egypt. And it was a Figure
to foretell them their deliverance from sin by the death of the true Lamb,
etc. See Exodus Chap. 12. and 13.

7 The Offering of a sheafe with the Ceremonies Verse 10. etc.
mentioned taught them to acknowledge that the blessing of New corn every
year, comes neither from the fertility of the ground, nor the labor and
industry of man, but from the Lord. Secondly, this Feast having his time
assigned, they could not enter upon their harvest before it was full ready,
which by this time it would be, unless they would either reap before they
offered this first sheafe, or offer it before the day appointed. And so, you
see, it had an use to restrain ill husbands, and to make them more careful,
that old corn might be governed to bring in new. A gracious God that will so
care for sinful man. Thirdly, it served to direct them to the time of
Pentecost, for from this day they reckoned seven Sabbaths, etc. as you read
verse. verse 15.
15. Lastly, being but one sheafe, it might strike their hearts with a fit
feeling of his goodness, that gives so much, and takes so little, that
gives without measure and takes by measure, yea by a very small measure: So
let it still profit us to this day, for even now also wereceyne much, and give
little, would we give that thankefully and cherefully, what a comsort would
God take in it? Though he need none of our goods, only seeking to exercise our
obedience and love.

8 And they might not eat till they had brought an offering Romans 11. (...)
unto God. ver. 14. Then God was first, but now is last with us, yet as good to
us, as ever to them, and we as deeply bound to him for infinite mercies. Will
not our sinful hearts in making God last, and giving him the worst, one day
condemn us?

9 Till they have brought, are the words, ver. 14. and note them, they then
brought, to show their willingness; we will bring none, but think we deal well,
if our minister may have it for fetching, etc.

10 The feast of Pentecost, sometimes called the feast of Weeks, was a
remembrance of the Law given, and so of their received liberty by Gods
outstretched arm, having now a law, and government of their own, when before
they were subjects and servants to the Egyptians, and their laws. So still you
see these holy days, were to remember mercies, and to give thanks. Again,
this feast figuratively fore-tolde them, there should come a Pentecost, when
the first fruits of the spirit should be given to men, fulfilled when Christ
sent the holy Ghost upon his Disciples assembled at Jerusalem Acts. 2.
at the feast of Pentecost.

11 The feast of Trumpets, here also appointed had verse 24.
many uses, as first in the opinion of some Hebrew Doctors, for a remembrance
of the deliverance of young Isaac from being sa(...)ed, God giving a Ram fast
in the Genesis ^2. 13.
bushes for him. Secondly, in the opinion of others, for a remembrance of the
creation of the world, which in some probability was about this time. Thirdly,
for a remembrance (says one) of the pardoning of that grievous Idolatry
committed by erecting and worshipping the golden calfe, which is thought was
about this time. Exodus 32. 4.
Fourthly, for a remembrance that this Month was once the first Month.
Fifthly, that they might learn holy assemblies to be appointed by the voice of
God. And if they then when they heard these Trumpets blow, might think God
called for them to the meeting: why should not we now having our Bells for their
Trumpets, think God calls for us to the Church and assembly of the
faithful, when we hear them ring in our ears? Surely I know a feeling heart
does, and thereupon cannot be quiet without going. Sixthly, that they might
learn their duties to be through their whole life to follow God, when and
whither so ever he should call. Lastly, (as our marginall note says) to put
them in remembrance of the many feasts in this Month, being the fittest time
in deed after all fruits and blessings gotten in, to meet and praise God for
them; praying also for grace soberly and orderly to use them to his glory, and
their own comfort, with all theirs whom God would have also cared for,
children, feruants, poor, etc. I forget to tell you, that one says this feast
also was a figure showing how Christ by the preaching of the Gospel, as by a
loud Trumpet should be spread oner the world, and our salvation by him. In
regard whereof John was called the voice of a crier, and the Prophet bids
other Mat. 3. 3. Esaias 58. 1.
criers, lift up their voices like Trumpets, etc.

12 In the 27 verse, the feast of Reconciliation is mentioned, Verse. 27.
of which more fully before in the xvi. Chapter.

13 Of the feast of Tabernacles, ver. 34. the use was verse 34.
to remember them of their estate, when they had no houses, but lived in Tents,
or Tabernacles, or Boothes made with laughes; no fields, nor lands, but lived
in the wilderness, and so to stir up a thankfulness for their happy change.
Secondly, to remember them of the Lords great works in driving out the
Cananites, and giving that fruitful land unto them: Then they were a pray to
all men, but now a terror to all men, wheresoever the same of them came.
Thirdly, it served to preach unto them the doctrine afterward delivered by the
Apostle, to wit, that here we have no abiding city, but should reckon of our
houses, as but of Tabernacles for the time, our true hope being for houses and
dwellings, and everlasting Tabernacles not made with hands in heaven, etc. And
may not we consider on our feast days all these things, although we have not
now the same ceremonies? May not we remember our state past under superstition,
cruelty, and bondage? May not we remember burnings and killings, and most
hateful handlings of bloudic Butchers and persecutors? May not we remember
great wars and dissentions in this our native Country, the fall of our
friends, and the change of many houses? May not we remember great impositions
and payments, and in one word, very many miseries and calamities? Laying them
to the present times, wherein we enjoy truth, and liberty of conscience
without either death or danger, or so much as any fear: what a change is this
to a man or woman, that knows and feels the blessing? O that we may send up
to God most thankful thoughts for it while we live! Now again we entoy peace:
such as no Nation has had the like. We are not eaten up with heavy and
continual payments, but we live as in heaven, by comparison to former times.
The Lord has driven away the Cananites that would have invaded and conquered,
had not he resisted for us, and overthrown them. He has made us a terror to
our foes, ^a refuge or sanctuary for our friends, when erst foreign nations
were Lords ouervs. And for the last point, we have no more certainty of abode
here the^ they had, but look for the same end of faith, an enduring house in
heane^. Let us the^ do what we ought to do, and what they did, thank God most
heartily for the change, and beseech him in his bottomless mercy to continue his
favors to us yt in peace we may live, in peace die, and in peace that never
ends live with him for ever. God for his sons sake grant it to us.

Ame^, Amen
CHAP. XXIIII.
IN this Chapter the first thing spoken of, are the Lights used in the
Tabernacle, Verse. 2.
whereof mention was made also before in the 17. Chapter. These lights were not
ordained for our imitation now under the Gospel, but in those times of shadows
and figures they signified, that while they were thus used the true light was
not yet come, by which all true believers should be delivered from the
darkness of death, as Saint Paul speaks of the Tabernacle, Heb. 9. Papists
lights then used still in their Churches and Massing places, are evident signs
that themselves see not the true light, and as much as lies in them they thus
confirm that Jewish expectance of the true light Christ, as if yet he were
not come. I know they have their excuses or reasons for every thing, but who
is able to abide most of them? As in this particular, why use they lights?
Forsooth, in representation of the Trinity, the wax representing the Father,
the week the Son, and the light the holy Ghost. This boldness is fearful,
and sinful, having neither warrant, fitness, nor reverence. Away with these
lights therefore, and embrace we the true light, who lightneth all that come
into the world, etc. John 1. 9.


2 This light also was a figure of true doctrine which ever must shine in the
Church and Tabernacle of God. (...) Chap. 27.
The oil Olive which they are commanded to bring, you see here must be pure,
to note that doctrine must have no mixture of man's devices, but be pure. The
Priest Ver. 4.
is the man that has charge of these lights, and God his Ministers still are
the Ministers of light, and have the charge of it in the house of God. Happy
they, if they be careful of it, to their best ability, that they may one day
hear that joyful voice, Come, come, thou good and Mat. 25. 21.
faithful servant, thou have been faithful over little, and therefore now I
will make thee ruler over much, Enter, enter into thy Masters joy, etc.

3 The next thing spoken of, is the Shewbread, spoken Verse 5. etc.
of also before. It likewise represented, that as yet the true bread from
heaven was not come. That it is God, upon whom the eyes of all things wait, and
that opens Psa. 145 15. 16
his hand, feeding both man and all his creatures with his blessings. That God
so loved the Jews, as he had them continually at his table with him: yea
every Tribe particularly he loved, there being 12. Cakes, for every Tribe one,
etc. More you may see, Chap. 25.

4 The third thing touched in this Chapter, is the matter of blasphemy, verse.
10. wherein your words are these. And there went out among the children of
Israel the son Verse 10.
of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian; and the son of the
Israelitish woman, and a man of Israel strove together in the host. So the
Israelitish woman's verse 11.
son blasphemed the name of God, and cursed, and they brought him unto Moses.
And they put him in ward, till Verse 12.
he told them the mind of the Lord. Then the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
Bring the blasphemer without the verse 13. Verse 14. Verse 15.
host, and let all that heard him, put their hands upon his head, and let all
the Congregation stone him. And thou shall speak unto the children of Israel,
saying, Whosoever curses his GOD, shall bear his sin. And he Verse 16.
that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death; as well the
stranger, as he that is borne in the land; when he blasphemeth the name of the
Lord, let him be slain. What this blaspheming was, if you look your marginall
note, it says, by swearing or despiting God. Interpreters mention diverse
opinions, and scanne both the Hebrew words, and the Greek translation of
them, all which I omit, as still mindful for whom I lahour, and I join with
him that says, Ego hunc locum sic intelligo, quod filius viri Egyptii male
precatus sit alteri in iurgio, vt fieri solet, and exoptauerit ei exitium aut
calamitatem, idque non simpliciter* sed per nomen Dei. Non dixit tantum, exopto
tibi malum sed addidit ac diserte nominanit Deum, aut nomen Domini, inquiens,
Dominus det tibi malum, and per dat te perpetuo. I understand this place thus,
that the son of the Egyptian father cursed the other in chiding as the manner
is, wishing destruction or some calamity, to him, and that not simply, but by
the name of God. For he said not only, I wish thee evil, but added and
plainly named God or the name of God, saying; the Lord give some evil to thee,
and utterly destroy thee. Our fearful and damned phrases are, Gods curse light
on thee: the plague of God take thee, etc. Which kind of speaking, is most
grievously to abuse the name of God, and to profane it, being not only a
breach of the second Table, concerning the love of our neighbor, but a breath
also of the first Table, by taking his most holy name in vain. This grievous
offender therefore, is not winked at by the^ that heard him, neither yet
punished by them that had no authority, out of a color of zeal, but he is
orderly, and by a right zeal carried to Moses the magistrate, and his offense
opened there. Moses again (although such a man) yet will do nothing has^ily in
judgment, and especially touching life, but he will be advised by God, who
then spoke from betwixt the Cherubims, Exodus 25. and Number. 7. And in the mean
time commits him to ward. The Lord answers him, and commands that he
shall be slain, giving a law also in general, that who soever so offends
shall die, the whole congregation stoning him, and the witnesses putting their
hands upon his head. By which Ceremony, the Lord made the witnesses careful
what they said. For it taught them, that if they bare false witness, then were
they guilty of the blood ^f him so shed by their testimony: but if they spoke
truly, then as he that offered a sacrifice by laying his hand upon the head of
it, and cast his sins upon the beast: so they by that ceremony, laid his
blood upon his own head, and they remained clear and blameless. Yea the
whole Congregation by such execution of justice, as by a sacrifice, is cleansed
and profited. So that when Phineas had slain the wicked person, it is said,
he turned Number. 25. (...)
the wrath of GOD from the land. And the slaying of the wicked, by the Prophets
is called, Victima Esaias. 34. Ierem. 46.
Dei, the Sacrifice of the Lord. For further use of it, you may think with
your self, how the father of this offender was a stranger, an Egyptian, and
yet God would not spare him: how much less then his own people, I mean now,
a Christian by father and mother, brought up in his fear, baptized in his
faith, a hearer of his word, a professer of it, etc. Secondly, this man was
angry, and in his anger he committed this fault, yet God spares him not, how
then do we excuse our offenses by our anger, saying, it was in my wrath that I
said so, or did so. For first, that anger and fury, and desire of revenge is
naught, then to use God in it, and to make him a party, or an executioner of
your rage, seeking and wishing that he may curse and plague, where you will
(he being all justice, all mercy, all goodness, etc.) O what an increase of
your sin is this? Ever therefore settle it and sink it in your heart, what
it is thus to abuse God, to abuse Christ, his wounds, his passion, whereby we
are sa^ed, and, by his grace, you shall abhor swearing, ^^ging, and ill
wishing, to any man, and especially to seek of him to do evil, and to use his
name to that end. Thirdly, when the Lord will have the whole Congregation to
stone him, he takes trial of the zeal of ALL, and teaches ALL to concur
with the Magistrate in love and liking of justice, and in furthering of it so
far as belongs to every man's place. Whereas now a days, we have such
factions, such affections, such corrupt humors in us, out of which i^ue such
dislikes, carpings, and bad censures of Magistrates, as they are grieved with,
justice is hindered, and God provoked to that which will smart, if he stay not.
Fourthly, he is carried out of the host to be slain, as a token of
detestation of his sin, by which he was unworthy, not only to live in the
Congregation, but also to die in the same, he was vomited or spued out, that
all others might see, and fear, Esaias. 14. read it. Fif^ly, by cursing of God,
and blaspheming of his name, understand not only swearing, and such evil
speaking as now has been noted, but all other unseemly, vnreuerent, and
wicked words, profane jests of him, his name, his word, his attributes,
mercy, justice, anger, providence, knowledge, patience, or such like. For all
these shall come into judgment, and find wrath. If the law of man pass them.
God will never pass them. The tongue we have was given to bless, not to
curse. And the name of God ^ro. 18. 10.
(says Solomon) is a strong tower: The just shall run to it, and be exalted.
For whosoever calls upon the name Act. 2. 21.
of the Lord shall be saved. His name serves for faith, for prayer, for
thanksgiving, for deliverance in danger, to obtain all good, and to avoid
all evil. To abuse this then in our furies, to our corrupt and sinful
desires: O what a sin is it, and how provoke it God to plague us! So are
his precious wounds our plasters, his blessed passion our salvation, his
Sacraments our comforts and seals of mercy, his Scriptures our light, and by
no means to be profaned in earnest or jest. We may not pervert his nature,
making him (as much as lies in us) of a benefactor a malefactor, of a Savior
a killer, of an helper an oppressor, neither may we abuse these holy things,
etc.

5 The fourth and last point of this your Chapter begins Verse 17. etc.
at the 17. verse, concerning the law of Tali^, that is, that look what a man
does, or intends to his neighbor, the like should be done to him, life for
life, breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, such a blemish as he
has made in any, such shall be repayed unto him, verse 20* Of this you have
heard, Exodus 21.

6 One law for the stranger, as for the home-borne, Verse. 22.
verse. 22. which both restrained that pride which otherwise might have been
in the Jew, and shows the common care of God for all men, as well as for the
Jew. If therefore a Jew hurt a stranger, look what he had done that should he
suffer, as well as the stranger should if he had hurt the Jew. This
indifferency is a blessed virtue to be learned from our God. For surely, we
are altogether affectionate, if God guide us not. If other men's children,
servants, or friends hurt ours, fire and sword for them; but if ours hurt them,
no such matter, al must be boulstred out, or bought out, or borne out, and
justice may not be done. Among our own again, one must be crucified, and
another not touched, on^ made a Saint, another a Devil. Who so is wise, will
note God and his Law here, and labor to follow it ever by such indiffer^ncie
as is fit for his place in Church, Commonwealth, or family. It comfort the
Subject, it hartneth the Child, it encourages a Servant: And the want of it,
does infinite much harm to all these. Finally, God is pleased with it, and you
are graced by it your self, it getting you love and all good report far and
near, among as many as are to be cared for. Thus much of this Chapter.

CHAP. XXV.
YOu have heard the observation of certain The sum of this Chapter. verse 4.
Days, now will this Chapter speak of the observation of Years, Namely,
every seventh year, and every fiftieth year. First, of the first, and then
of the Second. Every seventh year was the Sabbath of the earth, or the Rest
of the Land, because that year they might neither plowe, nor sow, nor dress
their Vines, but take what did grow of it self, and that must be common to
all. For so is the first verse to be understood. That which grows of it own
accord Verse 5.
of thy harvest, thou shall not reap, etc. That is, to thy private use and for
thy self alone thou shall not reap it, or gather it, but with others and
among others, they with thee, and thou with them, the fruits of that year so
springing shall be common. True therefore we may say it is of the land also and
earth, That which lacks Quod caret alterna requie durabile non est.
mutual rest, cannot endure. Whereupon among us we have an use, to let land
rest, some more, some less, according as it is in strength and goodness. And
that land that should continually bear without want six years, we would say
were good land. I remember the speech of one out of a good feeling, to some
wretched minded men that have never enough. Quid das tu terrae pro tot
messibus, mari pro tot piscibus, caelo pro pluuia, stellis pro^uce, etc. Si
nihil das, inuides requiem? etc. What give thou the earth for so many
haruests, the sea for so many fishes, the heavens for rain, the stars for
their light etc. If thou give nothing, do thou envy a rest? etc. This
therefore was a political cause of this Sabbath of the land the seventh year,
that it might continue and endure fruitful. Secondly, it had a Ceremonial
use, thus to put them in remembrance of that sin and fall which cast us all
out of Paradise, and brought men to labor, and the earth to need labor:
whereas if we had stood, the earth should have yielded of it self fruits and
profits, as in some glymse they might see by the seventh year. Again, it
shadowed out the true Sabbath and rest in Heaven, where shall be no labor and
yet no lack, but all comforts and joys above the reach of our hearts now to
feel or imagine. Read Esaias. 65. Behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth,
etc. Some-where also I have read, that this rest of the earth might rebuke the
wicked cruelty of some Masters, who have no pity of their servants or
cattle, but ever are laboring them, and sorry that their bodies be not brass
that they might never cease, when as a gracious GOD has pity upon the very
earth, and will have that to have a Sabbath and ^est.

2 In this seventh year, it was not lawful to require their debts. For so
you may read Deutro. 15. But some difference of opinions men have touching
this. Some say, their debt was clean lost, others say no, but for that year
deferred and forborne, after demanded lawfully and paid willingly, which is
more likely, forasmuch as these politic Laws of God were not ordained of God
to ouer-throw Justice, but to preserve it, and direct it in a commendable and
fit manner among men. Now it is Justice to let every man have his own. Then
again, the Hebrew Text in the place named Deutro. 15. is, Ab extremitate
septimi anni facies remissionem. Extremitas autem sunt initium and finis, From
the extremity of the seventh year thou shall make remission. Now the
extremity is the beginning, and the end; betwixt these, it was not lawful to
ask a debt, but before or after. Because for that year there was no tillage
to make money of, but after that returning to his use, the right of the
Creditor returned also, and the Lord graciously requited this forbearing, if
he did not withdraw his help because the seventh year approached. A right
and true application of this, may every feeling heart make in those Cities and
Towns within this Realm, where it has pleased God to lay his sore visitation
of Plague and infection, thereby stopping the Trade whereby every man was
enabled to get for his maintenance, and the discharge of such debts as were due
from him to others. God forbid but mercy should be found toward their
brethren in those, that look for mercy at Gods hand to themselves. When men
cannot receive, they cannot pay, and no dishonest meaning giving the stop, but
only the Lords hand staying Trade, who will be rigorous in such a case, and
say he fears God? when the earth rested and there was no tillage to raise
money by: You see the mercy of Gods Law here, and is it not all one when Trade
cease? Let your bowels then show whose child you are. If the Image and
superscription of God be upon you, surely you will show mercy, and give some
fit time to your debtor that means truly. Reade-ouer, and often, I pray you,
what God says Esaias 58. Verse 3. and so on: and remember he is the same God
still.

3 There was then an other great Sabbath year besides this seventh year,
Namely every fifty year, and it was called the Iubile, for says your
Chapter, Thou verse 8.
shall number seven Sabbaths of years unto thee, even seven times, seven
year, and the space of the seven Sabbaths of years will be unto thee 49.
years. Then thou shall 9. Iubilaeus a Iobel, quod significat buccinam.
cause to blow the Trumpet of the Iubile, etc. Upon which blowing, it had his
name of Iubile. The Ceremonies of this year were diverse and great: For it was
a great year. First, it was unlawful again in this year, to till the
ground, or to require debts, but a general rest and cessation was given this
way, as in the seventh year you have heard. Secondly, all Israelitish
servants in this year were free, and Lands, the profits whereof were sold,
returned again to the Tribe and Family for preserving that Law. Numb. 36. Ne
transferatur a tribu ad tribum, that it might not be alienated from tribe to
tribe, least so the tribes might have been confounded, and the truth not so
certainly have appeared, of what Tribe Christ came. This year of Iubile kept
the distinction most sure, and yet had they power to sell from Iubile to Iubile
as their need required. Thirdly, this year was an excellent figure of that
true Iubile and freedom, which by Jesus Christ the body of all shadows
should by trumpet be proclaimed to all that truly should believe in him. And
see the resemblaunce. This Jewish Iubile was proclaimed by trumpet: so should
the Christian freedom be by the trumpet of preaching the Gospel, which is
the most notable trumpet. In this Iubile of the Jews there were no debts
demanded and such things as grew of themselves were common: so in the
Christian Iubile is freedom proclaimed by CHRIST, Satan has no power to
demand what by sin we owe him, to wit, either soul or body, and all the
graces of CHRIST which grow of themselves, that is, freely are bestowed upon
us, and common in Christ to all, there being with him no respect of persons,
but all accepted that fear him and work righteousness. Of this freedom
speak the Scriptures comfortably every where, As by the Prophet Esaias 61. The
Spirit of the LORD is upon me, Esaias 61.
etc. He has sent me to preach good tidings to the poor, to bind up the
broken hearted, to preach liberty to the captives, and to them that are bound,
the opening of the prison, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and the
day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn. The Angel at his
birth, Behold, I bring you tidings Luke (...)
of great joy that shall be to all the people, that is, that unto you is borne
this day in the City of David, a Savior Matthew. 1.
which is CHRIST. the LORD. Why a Savior? An other Angel told the blessed
Virgin, because he should save his people from their sins: This is the true
freedom and Christian Iubile we speak of. If the Son John 8. 36. Act. 13.
38.
make you free, you shall be free in deed. Be it known unto you therefore
(says the Apostle) men and brethren, that through this Man is preached unto
you the forgiveness of sins, And from all things from which ye could not 39.
be justified by the Law of Moses, by him every one that believes is
justified. Thus Romans 6. Galat. 3. and in many (...) places. Thirdly, in this
Jewish Iubile there was a returning to their Lands and former possessions which
were alienated from them: so by this Christian Iubile, even this freedom
proclaimed by Christ, we return to our old Paradise again, from whence we
were cast by sin, that is, to the inheritance of the sons of God in Heaven
the true Paradise, from which we shall never be removed any more. O joyful
Iubile then if we feel it, that by the Trumpet of the Word is preached unto
us in Christ! He that has ears to hear, let him hear.

4 Besides these two Iubiles thus instituted of God, you have a third in these
days instituted of the Pope, The Romish Iubile.
to get unto him from foolish people great sums of money. The first Author
whereof was Boniface the eight, who devised to promise unto all them that would
come to Rome in the year 1300, and after that every hundredth year, to seek
pardon for their sins, a full remission of all their sins. After him,
Clemens the 6. (who was made Pope in the year 1342) finding the sweet of this
devise, and thinking every hundredth year too long, cut it of in the midst,
and according to this Mosaicall Iubile made his Romish Iubile every fiftieth
year, promising like pardons and indulgences to all comers. After him, came
Sixtus the fourth in the year 1473. and he thought fifty years too long
also, and cut it of once again in the middle appointing every 25. year a
Iubile. But see the desire of money in these holy fathers. When this time also
was too long to tarry for pardon-money, and they were ashamed to shorten it
again: they devise that certain appointed persons should go into all
Countries, with pardons to sell and offer to fools that would buy them, by
which pardons they should receive as full remission of all sins, as if they
had come in the year of Iubile to Rome to fetch them. Which gross abuse was
the means (God so having appointed) to stir up Luther to preach against that
abuse, and so was drawn on to other points, till light brake out of
darkness, etc.

5 In the 20. Verse, the Lord meets with an objection Verse. 20. (...)
of some men, that might happily say, what shall we eat the seventh year, for
we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase, etc? And most graciously and
comfortably he answers it. I will send my blessing upon you in the sixth
year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years, etc. The like sweet
promise Verse. 19. See then and sink it into your heart soundly, what God is
able to do for you touching all worldly necessaries, if you will obey him and
trust in him. Such a promise in Exodus Exodus 34.
he made also, to keep all things in safety for them at home, while they
were at Hiorusalem serving him according to this Law. And what loss had the
Shepherds when they left their flocks in the fields and went to the child
Jesus, according as the Angel had told them? Let this place again strengthen
your faith, against all objections of flesh and blood made from natural
reasons and causes as they seem to men. For if the Lord be able, even then
when the earth is weakest, having been worn out with continual tillage 5.
years together, to make ye 6. year bring forth a triple blessing, enough for
that year, for the 7. year, and for the 8. year, till harvest were ready;
what unseasonable weather, what barennesse of land, what this, what that, shall
make a man despair of Gods providence for things needful? Leave God to
himself and to his Almighty power, do you your duty, fear him, love him,
serve him, obey him with a true heart, call upon your children and servants to
do the like, and you shall see the loving kindness of the Lord to your
comfort. These things shall be cast upon you, and he that knows your Matthew.

charge, and gave you that charge, will never fail you nor them of what is
fit. You see here what he can do and let it profit you. I will tell you the
feeling of my heart further in this point, and thus I reason; Can God be thus
strong when the land is weak, and will he be thus strong to the comfort of his
servants? Why then cannot he be, or why will he not be strong in my weakness,
in your weakness, and in every man and woman's weakness that believe in him?
Away fear, away, I may not hearken unto thee, when I am weakest he will be
strongest. For his power is best seen in weakness, and 2. Cor. 12. 9.
I will trust in him, drawing an Argument with David from my weakness to move
him, and not to discomfort me, Heal me O Lord, for I am weak. My weakness
Psalm. 6. 2.
shall drive me unto thee, not from thee, and I will tarry thy good leisure. Lord
strengthen me, Lord comfort me, and under the covering of thy wings let me be
safe from al temptaions displeasing thee, and hurting me, Amen, Amen.

6 In the 29. Verse, If a man sell a dwelling house in a Verse. 29.
walled City, he may buy it out again within a whole year after it is
sold, etc. First, this and such other Laws confirm our trading and dealing
one with another by buyings and sellings, assuring us that such contracts are
lawful, and with a good conscience one man may use them with another.
Secondly, we see and learn, that GOD does not only know and regard the greater
matters of Kingdoms, and Princes affairs: but even the meaner actions also of
men, and the very smallest things are not hid from him. Therefore, do justly
in all trading, knowing that God his eye is upon thee, and then look for a
blessing, he shall not fail thee.

7 Moreover if thy brother be fallen in decay and Verse 35.
impouerished with thee, thou shall relieve him, etc. It is not enough to
abstain from taking that which is not mine own, but I must give that which is
mine own where need is: For mercy and humanity, to distressed persons, smell
sweet in the nostrils of the Lord, and have many blessings assured.

8 If thy brother impouerished sell himself unto verse 39.
thee, thou shall not compel him to serve as a bond servant. But as an hired
servant, and as a soiourner shall he be with thee, he shall serve thee unto the
year of Iubile. Before it was said, that servants should go free at the
seventh year, here that this sold man should serve till the Iubile, how agree
these together? Surely it is to be understood of such, as having their ears
bored have made themselves servants, unwilling to depart. Wh^ therefore in
regard of longer assurance of them, might hap^ily have been hardlier used of
some masters, than they that should be free sooner.

Lastly, when it is said, verse. 42. For they are my servants Verse 42.
whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, they shall not be sold as bondmen
are sold. Thou shall not rule verse. 43.
over them cruelly, but shall fear thy God. Let us remember, that albeit Moses
law in these things has his end for form, yet the equity still binds in
these things, and the estate of servants under ye Gospel brought and bought out
of spiritual Egypt and bondage of sin by Christ the Lord, may not be worse
than it was under the Law, when you see they might not be cruelty ruled and
dealt with. To this end the Apostles exhortation teudeth. Ephesians. 6. 9. And let
thy soul love a good Eccles. 7.
servant (says the Wise man) and leave him not a poor man. Other things in
this Chapter I leave to your own reading, and these serving for a taste of the
fruit of it, I stay here.

CHAP. XXVI.
Having now made an end of his Lawes^ The sum of this Chapter.
in this Chapter the Lord most effectually exhorts to the obedience of the
same. First, by his gracious promise of blessing if they so did; and secondly,
by a fearful threatening of punishment if they did otherwise. His blessings
which he promises are these. First, fruitfulness of the ground, in the 4. and
5. verses. I will send you rain Ver. 4.
in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the
field shall give their fruit, and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage,
and the vintage shall Verse. 5.
reach unto sowing time, and you shall eat your bread in plenteousnesse, and
dwell in your land safely.

2 Secondly, forasmuch as the fruitfulness of their ground should be little
worth, if the enemy came in and spoiled it, or evil beasts devoured either
it, or them, therefore, the Lord promises them peace and public tranquillity
both from man and beast, saying, I will send peace in the land and you shall
sleep, and ^erse 6.
none shall make you afra^d; also I will rid evil beasts out of the land, and
the sword shall not go through your land.

3 The third blessing promised is victory over their enemies, when he says.
And you shall ch^se your enemies, Verse 7.
and they shall fall before you upon the sword. And five of you shall chase an
hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight, and your
enemies shall verse 8.
fall before you upon the sword.

4 The fourth blessing is increase of the fruit of their Verse 9.
bodies in these words, For I will have respect unto you, and make you
increase, and multiply you, and establ^sh my Covenant with you.

5 To this increase of people, he will also give increase of food, without
which, the more popul^us the more miserable. Ye shall eat old store (says he)
and carry verse (...)
out old because of new.

6 Finally, in few words much, I will set my Tabernacle verse 11.
among you, and my soul shall not loath you. Also I will walk among you, and
I will be your God, and you verse 12.
shall be my people. I am the Lord your GOD, which verse 13.
have brought you out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their
bondmen, and I have broken the bonds of your yoke, and made you go upright.
This I say again, in few words is much, nay all, all. For what can want to
that people, nation, town, or house, where God dwells and walks being
their God, and they his people? If I walk in the shadow Psalm. 23.
of death (says David) I will not fear, for thou art with m^e, etc. See and
read with this Chapter the 28. of Deuteronomy. Upon these grounds, are all the
exhortations of the Prophets.

7 Yet take it not, as though ever where these out-warde blessings are, there
were Gods favor and love. For by these things (says the Scripture) No Eccles
91. ^sal 73, 5. etc.
man knows love or hate, and, The wicked swim in wealth, says David, and
have no misfortunes like other men. The LORD suffers both his rain to fall
Mat 5 45.
and his Sun to shine as well upon the evil as the good. Blessed are the
people that be in such a case Psa. 144. 1^.
but rather blessed are they that have the Lord for their God And therefore one
truly instructed says again with David, The greater sort of people do wish
th^s Psa 4. 6, 7.
things, but Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance Psalm. (...).
upon me, etc. Secondly, touching these promised blessings, you must ever
beware of appoynting GOD a time, or of fainting and slipping from God, if by
and by our expectation and desire be not answered. But, though he tarry,
wait; for he shall surely come, and Abac. 2. 3.
shall not stay. Your prayer is daily, Thy will be done, Thus of blessings
promised.

2
The Lords second Argument (as I said) is drawn from Punishments assured if
they would not obey his laws, verse 14. and so forward. Where first you may
verse 14.
do well, to observe how the word MY is repeated in the 15. verse. Mine
Ordinances, My Laws, My Commandments, Verse 15.
My Covenant. It teaches us that it is sin in deed which is committed
against GODS commandments, not against I know not what superstitions
traditions of men, as neither is the obedience to them any obedience cared for
of God.

2 As before we were not to conclude, savor and love upon the outward
blessings n^med, so neither now may we reason from these aff^ictions ever to
hatred or dislike. For as outward blessings befall the evil so out-ward
crosses befall the good, and diverse are the ends why God afflicts his
children, not ever for sin, nor in anger, But whom the Lord loves he
chastises, etc. Abel was slain that the lot of the godly might be noted in
him. Job sore afflicted for the trial of his faith, and the Churches
instruction. Joseph imprisoned and much wronged, that first he might be
humbled, and then exalted. The blind man in the Gospel, neither for his own
sins nor his parents, but that Gods glory might appear. The Apostles
afflicted that they might learn, and we know our Master his kingdom is not
of this world. By impiety judge of crosses not by crosses of impiety.

3 The punishments in particular threatened to all wilful contemners of Gods
will, it is better for you to read as they lie in the Text, then for me to
stand upon. They are many, they are fearful: many and sore diseases:
Invasion by enemies, whereof see example, Judge. 6. and 10. and 2. Chron. 12:
Barre^nesse of the earth, see example. 1. King. 17. Esaias. 5. Amos. 4. etc:
Evil beasts, see Deutro. 32. and Ezekiel 5: Besieging of foes, plague, and
^estilence, see 2. King. 6. Lament. 4. etc. O tremble to provoke this God
against you.

4 But after all these dreadful and terrible threats, see what you read.
verse. 42. Then I will remember my Verse 42.
Covenant with Jacob, and my Covenant also with Isaac. etc. The land also, in
the mean season, shall be Verse 43.
left of them, and shall enjoy her Sabbaths wh^lest she lies waste without
them, but they shall willingly suffer the pun^shments of their iniquity,
because they despised my laws, etc. Yet notwithstanding this, when Verse 44.
they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away,
neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly, nor to break my Covenant
with them, for I am the Lord their GOD. But I will remember for verse 45.
them the Covenant of old, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt in the
sight of the Heathen, that I might be their God, I am the Lord, etc. Some are
of opinion, that these words were fulfilled in the captivity and deliverance
out of Babylon. But the Jews persuade themselves, that this promise of regard
when they should be in the land of their enemies, is not yet accomplished, but
that they shall by virtue hereof, be delivered one day out of this estate
they are now in, scattered and dispersed into many places. The which conceit
of theirs, others think to be but an idle dream, alleging that the Law and
Prophets were unto John, and that the Jews shall never have any more
government as they had. They apply therefore this promise to a true penitent
sinner, who shall ever be respected upon his conversion, albeeit he neglected
the time of grace offered. Yet this is no imboldning to presume, but a comfort
when repentance is true.

5 Ways yet of God his delivering penitent sinners are diverse, and to be
observed that we err not. For some, upon their sorrow God not only receives
to mercy and favor, but also delivers them out of their present affliction.
So did he Manasses the king, 2. Chron. 33.
when being for his sin bound in iron and carried away captive, the Lord
upon his remorse in those yrons, not only forgave his sin, but released
those bands, and brought him to his kingdom again. Others he receives unto
favor, and forgiueth their sin, but yet suffers them to fall by their
outward affliction. So did he to the penitent Thief upon the Cross, he
receives him into Paradise, but saved him not from that temporal death. The
due remembrance of this, is a great comfort against the loss of friends in
wars, and plagues, and such like calamities, when others escape and do well.
Let us therefore cleave fast unto God, believe his mercy, fear his justice.
So whatsoever happens unto us, shall happen for our good one way or other.

6 In the 28. of Deutro. these blessings and cursings are repeated again, most
effectually to move any heart that has grace. Wherefore I often erhort all
that desire to live godly, to read it often, that it may power-fully persuade
them to be wise, and to take time while time serves, to turn to the Lord,
while his arm is stretched out to receive them. For with the foolish Virgins
to come to late, will be woe without comfort, and destruction without help.
Make no tarrying, says Ecclesiasticus to turn unto the Lord, Eccles. 5. 7.
and put not off from day to day, for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord
break forth, and in thy security thou shall be destroyed, and thou shall
perish in the time Aug in. Exo. 5
of vengeance. Hoc in multis impletur, sed nemo intell^git, nec quisquam
aduersa sustinens malis suis aestimat irrogari, sed quod pertulerit,
consu^tudinis potiusputat esse quam criminis, etc. This (says Saint Augustine)
is fulfilled in many, but none understands, neither does any man when he
suffers evil, persuade himself that his sin is punished, but attributes
such happes rather to custom then to crime, etc. This is a great blindness,
and therefore pray against it, and beware of it. This Chapter will ever assure
us, sin will have plagues first, or last, and therefore when they happen,
complain of sin, and not of God, remembering that true and good saying. Quae
ratio est vt doleamus nos non audiri a Deo, cum ipsi non audiamus Deum? Et
suspiremus non respici a Deo terras, cum ipsi non respiciamus in coelum, and
molestum sit despici a Deo praeces nostras, cum praecepta eius despiciantur a
nobis. What reason is there we should grieve that God will not hear us, when
we our selves will not hear God? Or why sigh we that God will not look down
to the earth, when we our selves will not look up to heaven? We can despise
his precepts, and yet he may not despise our prayers. We beat our servants if
they offend us, being but men as they are, and God may not beat us for our
faults, he being our Creator, and we but dust. Thus make use of these curses,
and in stead of them, God ever vouchsafe us, for his sons sake, his blessings.

CHAP. XXVII.
This is the last Chapter of this Book, and contains two general Heads. The
matter Of Vows. The matter Of Tithes.


TOuching the First, A Vow properly signifies, a Promise Votum significat
desiderium; vnde, Pro voto successit; and voti compos sum, etc. Significat
etia^ promissionem Deo factam; Si enim quid Deo promittitur, dicitur votum; si
homini, dicitur promissum.
made to GOD willingly and advisedly in a matter lawful and possible. In the
Book of Numbers, Chap. 30. You may see what Vows were lawful, and what not;
here, how lawful Vows are to be performed, or redeemed being of that sort
that might be redeemed. For of Vows, some are commanded of God and cannot be
redeemed, but must needs be performed: such a Vow is the Vow of Baptism, of
Faith, and of newness of life in the Lords Supper. Of which sort of Vows the
Psalm says, Offer to GOD the sacrifice of praise and pay thy Vows to the
most High. If thou Vow, Psalm. 50.
pay it, etc. Eccles. 5. Some Vows are simply unlawful, Eccle. 5.
being either sins when they are made, or not to be performed without sin.
Some are neither forbidden, nor commanded, but indifferent. And in these we
must take heed, that we make them not as any services of God, or merit to our
selves. For true it will ever be, that, in vain do men worship GOD teaching
Matthew. 15.
for doctrine men's precepts. In this Chapter observe sundry particulars of
things named that might be vowed to God.

Persons. Beasts. Houses. Fields, etc.
Concerning Persons, a man might then vow either himself, or such as were
subject to his authority and power, unto the service of God. Thus Anna vowed
to GOD the Male-childe which God should give her, if he in mercy would
vouchsafe to give her one, according to her great and earnest desire. And she
accordingly performed her vow, when God graciously gave her Samuel 1. Sam. 1.
2^.
her son. But in case a person thus vowed had a desire to be free again, the
Lord permitted that there might be a redemption made according to sex and age
with money. And if the party were so poor that such a rate could not be
performed, then was the Priest to nominate and appoint the quantity or sum
that should be paid. The proportions named in your Chapter here are these.
Verse 3. A Male from 20. years to 60. was valued See Exo. 30. 13 twenty Gerah^
Thus might Iephtah have redeemed his daughter, and therefore his sin the great
and.
at 50. sicles, that is 50. pounds. Verse 4. A Female at 30. sicles, that is
30. pounds, after 5. shillings the ounce sterling. Verse 5. From 5. years to
20. the Male at 20. sicles, the Female at 10. Verse 6. From a Month to 5.
years old a Male at 5. sicles, a Female at 3. Verse 7. From 60. years
upward, a Male at 15. sicles, a Female at 10. Verse 8. If any could not pay
this, then the Priest rated as I said.
Et hac redemptio fit, vt quae morte propria non expletur, saltem praetio
vouentis deuotio compleatur. And this redemption is made (says one) that the
devotion which was not made by death, at least might be made by the commutation
which the Vower should give.

2 The second sort of things that might be vowed verse 2.
were beasts, Verse 9. where you see if it were a Beast that lawfully might
be offered in sacrifice, then was there no redemption allowed of it. But if it
were any unclean beast of which men do not offer a Sacrifice unto Verse 11.
the Lord, then it might be redeemed, and in case the party would not redeem
it, the Priest might sell it. If there were a redemption made, then was a fifth
part more above the valuation to be given, because it was a D^licti speciem
habuit, and in expiatione del cti, quinta pars dabatur. Chap. 6. Verse 14.
kind of fault (at least in show) to take that back again, which was once
given to God, and to retain to a private use what was given to a religious and
holy use.

3 The third sort were Houses Verse 14. when a man shall dedicate his House to
be holy unto the Lord, then the Priest shall value it, whether it be good or
bad, and as the Priest shall prise it, so shall the value be. Here also lay a
redemption, as you may see in the next verse. The fourth sort were fields,
whereof some were by inheritance, Verse 15.
some by purchase. If the Field were inheritance, then was there one manner of
redemption, Verse 16. etc. verse 16. Verse 22.
if by purchase, then an other verse 22. etc.

4 Verse, 26. Notwithstanding the first borne of the beasts because it is the
Lords first borne, none shall dedicate such, be it Bullock or sheep, for it
is the Lords, etc. You know the first borne were the Lords by an other Law, and
no redemption might be made of such, but they must be left to the service of
God, as they were appointed either to be offered in Sacrifice, or to be to the
use of the Priests, etc.

5 There were of Vows again two kinds, one simple, whereof you have seen
these perticulars, an other which had an execration or curse joined to it, if
the Cherem Hebr. (...) gr^.
thing vowed should be changed from the use and end allotted, whereof now your
Chapter speaks in the next Verse 28.
place, Verse 28, and 29. Notwithstanding, nothing separate from the common
use, that a man does separate unto the Lord of all that he has (whether it be
man, or beast, or land of his inheritance) may be sold nor redeemed: for every
thing separate from the common use, is most holy unto the Lord. Nothing
separate from the common Verse. 29.
use, which shall be separate from man, shall be redeemed, but dye the death.
Where you must understand by separate, such a separation or vow as is made with
a curse if it be altered. In which there was no redemption allowed, or sale, or
alienation any way. In this sort, if men were vowed, they must dye and not be
spared. But then not innocent men must be vowed, but Malefactors that by evil
doing deserved death. Such were the men of Jericho. Joshua 6. and Achan, Joshua
7. the Amelakites, 1. Sam. 15. and such others, which made the sin of Saul
and the people very great, when they spared Agag the King and the better sheep
and Oxen, and the fat beasts, and the Lambs, and all that was good and
would not destroy them. And here hence sprang that kind of giving things to
the Church for the service of God, that you see in many old Charters in
England, with a grievous curse upon all those that should alter and change
those things from that use, wherein they showed their earnest desire to have
things continue as they were given.

6 Now, if you ask why God ordained these kind of Vows? the answer is, that
he did it in two respects. First, that his people might not follow the fashion
of the idolatrous heathens round about them, who had their fashion of vows
wicked and sinful, but might be directed in a good sort, seeing they would
follow some sort. Secondly, that here-hence might spring some maynteinance for
the Minister, whereof in all things, and by all means, he showed his gracious
care.

7 They of the Romish Religion, as from these Rites and customs of the old
Testament, they have borrowed many things; so have they vowing, and many
strange Vo(...)es have they in use and high regard. They have also redemptions
of their Vows, namely Pardons, and dispensations, matters of no small profit
to them. But the Leuiticall Priesthood being ended, and all these Ceremonies,
Rites, Customs, and Laws that were not Moral, by the coming of the Lord
Jesus the truth of all Figures and shadows, and man having no power of his
own head, to erect and devise any worship of GOD without his warrant in his
Word, easily may we see and all men with us, what ground their Vows have, and
how pleasing they are to GOD. Their own Friends and Favorites do say and
write, In malis promissis rescinde fidem, in turpi voto muta decretum. In evil
promises spare performaunce, in a foul Vow change thy determina^ion. Quod
i^caute vouisti ne facias: What unadvisedly thou have Vowed, accomplish not. Et
non erit hoc praeuaricatio, sed temeritatis emendatio: And this shall not be
any unfit varying, but a most fit reformation of rashness. Melius est non
vouere, quam vouere id, quod sibi is cui promittitur, exolui nolit: Better it
is not at all to Vow, then to Vow that, which he to whom the promise is
made, will not have paid to him. Virginitas carnis non seruatur mente
corrupta: intactis corporibus, fugit castitas de moribus: Virginity of the
flesh is not kept when the mind is corrupt: Though the body be never
touched, yet chastity often flies from a man and woman's manners. With many
such like sayings worthy noting.

8 Yet let us know, that there are two sorts of Vows, Civil Vows, and
Religious Vows. Civil An other division of Vows.
Vows are such as Men make to Men in honest, lawful, and possible things,
binding themselves thereby to a performance of what they promise. And those in
honesty (...) firm, until they be either performed, or r(...)ased by him,
or them, to whom they were made. Religious Vows are such as are made to
perform thereby some worship to GOD, and they are of two sorts: either such
as are Vere Religiosa, Truly religious, Or Speciem habent, or such as have a
show of Religious Vows. Truly Religious are they, that bind to the
performance of things commanded, as that in Baptism named before, and in the
other Sacrament of the LORDS Supper, with such like. In Prayer also and
Thanksgiving, unto which usually Vows were annexed, in Prayer showing their
most earnest desire to obtain their requests at Gods hand; and in thanksgiving
showing their due feeling of his goodness, and in regard thereof promising to
do this or that lawful thing, when they should come to the place where
Sacrifices only were to be offered all places as you know being not allowed,
but the place which God did choose, from which many Jews dwelled far, and
came but at times. And as prayers were made in peril of sickness, of sea, of
war, and such like so were Vows. Such as have a show of Religious Vows are
those that are devised for the honoring of God; but have no warrant from him,
neither indeed are allowed of him. And these again may be said to be of two
sorts. For sometimes they are directly against and ^ontrary to the Word, as to
vow any man's death, as they did Paul's in the Acts, to vow to call upon Saints
and Creatures in our prayers with such like. Sometimes they are not contrary,
yet not expressly commanded, but (...) indifferent. And these things being
drawn by a vow from their true nature of indifferency, and made necessary
to salvation and to Gods service, there is a will worship dispeasing ^al (...).
1.
to God. But because this matter of Vows will come in a more fit place to be
spoken of (if God please) in the Book of Numbers, there (...) leave the
orderly Treatise of them to that pl(...)

9 The reference here made to the (...) far it is from establishing any
Popish eare-shri(...) (...)ry child may perceive, and therefore weak is that
doctrine that leans upon such weak grounds. I have else where sufficiently
disprooued this error, and therefore stand not upon it here.

2.
The second part of the Chapter is concerning Tithes, which matter has been
also somewhat touched before, with this people of the Jews there were three
kinds of Tithes. One, that was yearly given to the Levites of all corn and
cattle: An other, that the Levites paid to the Priests out of those which they
received of the people, which Tithes were called (...) Tithes out of tithes,
whereof you read. Numb. 18. 26. Speak Decimam partem decimae.
also unto the Levites and say unto them, when ye shall take of the Children
of Israel the Tithes which I have given you of them for your inheritance, then
shall ye take an heave offering of that same for the Lord, even the tenth part
of the tithe: A third that was paid every third year beside the general
tithes, out of all fruits grown upon the earth, and laid up to the relief of
the poor, and of the Levites and strangers; which tithes were called (...) the
poores tithes whereof yo(...)ead Deutro. 14. 28. At the end of the third year,
thou shall bring forth all the tithes of thine increase of the same year. and
lay it up within thv gate, etc. Read the Marginall Note, there in your Bible.
The like again in the 26. Chap. The paying of tithes will tau^ht them, that
life and all the nourishments of life, which the ^arth yealdeth, are the gifts
of a gracious God, that over and above all deseruings, powers his mercies upon
men. They maintained the Ministry, relieved the poor, etc. As has been
said, and they shadowed Christ the inheritance of the Levites, and as yet of
all Ministers, and the comfort of all men that depend upon him. The number of
Ten, is a perfect number and absolute, beside which there is no other which is
not contained in it: So is Christ the beginning and end of all. And they taught
that a part being made holy by dedication to God, all the rest should be
holily used, and neither spent in riot and sin, nor hoorded up to make a
dearth and famine to the destruction of the poor, etc.

2 There are spiritual tithes, which the godly have a care ever to give unto
God, by referring all the gifts of body and mind which the Lord had bestowed
upon them to the service and glory of his Name. Which tithes Pharaoh paid not,
when he said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey him or hear him. Neither
Asshur when he boasted of his strength and power against God, whereof Esaias 10.
Verse 7, and so on, read it I pray you. Neither Nabuchadnezzar, Antiochus, and
others that being worms meat and dust, yet insulted over God and forgot
themselves. God keep us out of the company of them, and the rank with them,
and God grant that we may carefully, as we are able, give the Lord Tithe of
our several abilities any way. My Brethren the Ministers of his holy Word and
Sacraments by teaching and laboring every way to save fowls, and to bring men
to the fold of Christ, never caring what evil men may say of their preaching
or writing, of the plainness of it, manner of it, or such like, but pitching
their eyes and hearts upon God and his people, Feed, feed, feed his Sheep,
his L^mbes, the price of his Sons blood with all their love and strength,
thinking, whilst there is (...), how much the praise of man for curiosity,
eloquence, and affectation, shall differ from the praise of GOD when he shall
say, O good and faithful servant. etc. What should I add? some men will
scorn all admonition, yet all, neither do nor will. So to fly a pitch here,
as a man may both fly-vp, and pitch in heaven hereafter, is an happy thing, And
I say no more.

Thus much shall suffice of this Book called Leuiticus, the use whereof I
showed in the beginning, and I hope have now fully made manifest by the
perticulars that have been handled. My poor labor. I humbly commend to him
that made my heart and knows my heart. He has blessed, and can bless every
man's endeavors according to his gracious will and pleasure. In which had I not
rested; too well I know these days and times what discouragements they yield
many ways, than in them to have gone foreward any further, but to have stayed
with that which I began when things were better taken. Yet blessed be GOD, he
has his portion, and Wisdom is justified of her children. The Preacher,
says Saint Gregory, In Ezech. Hom. 3.
should be like the Smiths burning iron, which not only heateth those that
are near, but casts sparks far of. The Sun (says an other) is content
not only to shine unto us present, but will do the like to those that succeed
when we are gone: and so should the Preacher do. Et paucis natus est qui
populum suae aetatis tantummodo cogitat: And he is borne but for a few, that
only thinks of the people present when he lives, says wise Seneca. Homo
nascitur reipub: A man is borne for the Epist. 82.
Commonwealth says the Civil Law, and not for the time only wherein he
loves. For non minoris curae est mihi qualis post mortem meam Respub: fuerit,
quam qualis body: My care is no less for the time to come after me, then for
the present, could Tullie say. Ano Aristotle, Bonum universal diuinius est.
The good that is general is more excellent. All which sayings, I trust no man
will deny may as rightly be applied to the Minister of God, and his Church. Let
no man therefore accept with the left hand what is given with the right. We
have all a Judge, and he is righteous. We must give an account one day both how
we have labored, and encouraged or discouraged others to labor. Our abilities
are not alike, but the God of mercy accepts faithfulness in the meanest.
The herb that is good is not rejected in the use it serves for, because the
Gardener that planted it was inferior to many Gardiners more excellent. I will
say no more, but with eyes and heart cast to him that only gives increase
whosoever planteth or waters, beseeth him for his Sons sake, to make these
my poor endeavors profitable, as I wish them to his Church.

Laus Deo.
