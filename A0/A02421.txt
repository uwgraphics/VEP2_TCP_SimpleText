CERTAIN English verses penned by DAVID GWYN, who for the space of eleven
years and ten months was in most grievous servitude in the galleys under the
King of Spain, and now lately by the wonderful providence of God, delivered
from captivity, to the overthrow of many of the Spaniards, and the great
rejoicing of all true hearted English men.

Presented to the Queens most excellent Majesty in the Park at Saint James

Certain English verses, presented to the Queens most excellent Majesty, in
the Park at Saint James, on Sunday the xviii. of August 1588.
SVch Rebels as do mean to sell,
their crown to foreign foes:
Against their Queen for to rebel
whose secrets God disclose.
Mark well, and read this story mine,
though simple and rude it be:
And to your Queen with heart incline
let treason from you flee.
For I am one that captive am,
and know the Spaniards heart:
Although he love the traitors name,
at length he makes him smart.
He gives the traitor daily pay,
while treason is a working:
But afterward to his decay,
he cuts him short from barking.
Which is the due and just reward,
that does belong to treason:
The hangman takes him by the beard,
to cut his head with reason.
Examples many I could bring,
which lately has been proved:
Of those that wrote to Philip king,
whose hearts to treason moved.
The youthful Duke of Bragan soil,
Bargansiae called by name:
Who gave the Portugal the spoil,
and brought himself to shame.
Also the Coundie of Caskails,
did join with him in treason:
Pretending for to purchase vailes,
being void and clear of reason.
And so they sold their native land,
to Philip king of Spain:
Who having Portugal in hand,
as king therein did reign.
Who sudainly did turn his face,
from this good duke and Coundie^
And gave no credit to their race,
wherein they knew the folly.
Therefore good Christian countrymen,
take heed, beware betime:
Let no false treason move you then,
to Pope, nor Spanish king.
Let not affection blind your eyes,
nor popish tales deceive:
Let not the Spaniards tales nor lies,
constrain you to believe.
For they are devils, and are not gods,
seeing people they deceiues:
I wish you well, believe him not,
if you will live at ease.
Therefore you Saxon sort,
that rebels mean to live:
Mark well, and read the evil report,
that Portugals do give.
The Southern Spanish race,
that mankind would subject:
To turn us all from Christ's laws,
to live in Popish sect.
Repent therefore in time,
and call to God for grace:
To Queen Elizabeth do incline,
and fly from Spaniards race.
Be true unto the English Crown,
and do the Pope detest:
Procure to beat the Spaniards down,
the Romans, and the rest.
Examples good you may well take,
of Italy, and Cicilia soil:
By spaniards, Flanders all does quake,
they Portugale did spoil.
Therefore, good English knights,
be true unto your Queen:
In noble minds set your delights,
and fly from treason clean.
Mark well a Captives plaint,
that does lament your case:
To Queen Elizabeth be you not faint,
and call to God for grace.
And thus with mournful heart,
from Galley I do end:
Where I do feel the bitter smart,
of Popish Spanish men.
Farewell good native soil,
farewell good Country mine:
Defend your land from Spanish foil,
and fly from Spanish line.
I write with doleful pen,
my leave of you to take:
My life I lead in Galley cheyne,
from whence my moan I make.
Viuat Regina Elizabetha*
An other at the same time delivered to her Majesty by DAVID GWYN.
THe Eagle and the Lion fearce,
do join their subjects all:
Against the Saxon soil to pearce,
their counsel they do call.
To know the way for to obtain
their long desired will,
In judgment seat they sit again,
to utter all their skill.
And as the commons brag and boast,
a fleet they mean to make:
To sail unto the English coast,
the Queen and land to take.
With help of Rebels they do think,
the Saxon land to spoil:
If Queen and Counsel do not wink,
the land can have no foil.
But those that lurketh in the den,
and did not know the smart:
I mean some kind of English men,
which bears a Spanish heart.
They think the Crown of joy to win,
by treason and by guile:
Against the Christian English Queen,
to please the Spaniards wile.
Therefore good nobles play your part,
defend your Queen and land:
Against the Spaniards show your art,
your force and mighty hand.
Good Christian Clergy, send abroad
your preachers for to show:
How bondage is a deadly rod,
in winters time you know.
The Spaniardes make the Christian slave,
and bondmen unto thrall:
Their heads and beards they daily shave,
which is a dreadful fall.
They mean with force of fiery sword,
your Saxon land to run:
They say it is for Christ's word,
and Romans laws among.
They swear by Christ, and by their beards,
the English Queen to take:
The Counsel and the Nobles heads,
to make them all to quake.
The merchant and the venterers,
with Spanish brag they threate:
The officers and the laborers,
with fists they mean to beat.
Therefore you worthy wightes,
that pass the southern seas*
Man out your princely ships,
your foes for to displease.
And keep your English coast,
from Phillip King of Spain:
And from all those that daily boast,
to put you all to pain.
I write no more, I wish you well,
my mind you may well know:
From captives chain where I do dwell,
with bitter pains and woe.
An other presented to her Majesty by David Gwyn in commendation of Sir
Francis Drake.
O Noble knight, O worthy wight,
O prince of navigations:
In martial affairs is thy delight,
for countries preservation.
Thy noble fame like Phoebus trim,
in all the world is spread,
As eclipse the sun and moon does dim,
so Spaniards do thee dread.
Thy valiant acts and worthy heart,
deserves eternal fame:
Thy knowledge and Astrologies art
does verify the same.
Thy happy course that thou did run
unto the western land.
Did make the Spaniards all to shun,
as fearing of thy hand,
Sanda Domingo makes great moan,
Carthagena eke does cry,
The western Isles do greatly groan,
thy force has bin so nie.
Kalles likewise does greatly fear,
with reason thereunto.
The narrow straites do daily care,
because thou art their foe.
Thy enterprise has bin so high,
that Turks could not compare,
Nor with his galleys come so nigh,
which makes them all to fear.
The Graund English they thee do call
of famous good report,
The Spaniards and the Portingall,
to England will resort,
To serve the Queen and thee, good Drake
for thy good famous acts,
The Spanish King they will forsake
with England to compact.
Thou art so dread as God is feared,
in southern coast and land:
The Spaniard daily shakes his beard,
and fears thy mighty hand.
Therefore good worthy Drake,
serve thou thy sovereign Queen,
And make the Spanish foe to quake,
and English force be seen.
For help and aid thou shall not want
thy virtuous queen is bent,
Money and victualles is not scant,
and men will not repent.
If thou will follow victory,
as first thou did begin:
All Protestants will pray for thee,
and for our gracious Queen.
The Spaniards brag and make great boast
as thou do partly know,
A huge great fleet they make in haste,
as letters mine did show.
Wherein I writ a warning good,
to thee and to the queen,
Rehearsing all both bad and good
that in their fleet was seen.
Also I wrote the sum of men,
as near as I could learn,
And sent it by an Englishman,
whereby thou might discern.
To know thy foes, and what they be,
all kind of generation:
The dukes and earls in their degree
rehearsed by relation,
Their ships and force I daily wrote,
and all their preparation:
To name them all I missed not,
as void of desperation.
And thus, good noble knight,
my simple verse I end,
Unto thy hand good worthy wight,
my help I do commend,
And wish all English christian men
to pray for me poor Gwyn,
That lies in bondage and in chain
with popish Spanish king.
FINIS.
