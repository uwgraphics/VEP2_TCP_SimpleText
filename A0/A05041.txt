The Lamentation of a new married man, briefly declaring the sorrow and grief
that comes by marrying a young wanton wife.
To the tune of, Where is my true Love
YOu Batchelors that brave it
So gallant in the street,
With Musk and with Rose Water.
Smelling all so sweet:
With Shoes of Spanish leather,
So featly to your feet,
Behold me a married young man.
Before that I was wedded,
I lived in delight,
I went unto the dancing School,
I learned at Fence to fight:
With twenty other pleasures,
That now are banished quite,
I being a married young man.
When I lived single,
I knew no cause of strife,
I had my heart in quiet,
I led a pleasant life:
But now my chiefest study
Is how to please my Wife,
I being a young married man.
Quoth she, You do not love me,
To leave me all alone,
You must go a gadding,
And I must bide at home,
While you among your Minions,
Spend more then is your own:
This life leads a married man.
Do you think to keep me
So like a drunge each day*
To toil and moyle so sadly,
And lame me every way?
I Will have a maid, bir Lady,
Shall work while I do play,
This life leads a married man.
Then must I give attendance
Upon my Mistress heels:
I must wait before her,
While she does walk the Fields.
She Will eat no meat but Lobsters,
And pretty Grigs and Eeles:
This life, etc.
Then must I get her Cheries,
And dainty Kather'n Pears:
And then she longs for Codlings,
She bredeth Child she swears:
When God knows it is a Cushion
That she about her hearts:
This life, etc.
She must have Rabbet suckers,
Without spot or specke:
I must buy her Pescods
At sixteen groates the Pecke:
She must have Eggs and white wine,
To wash her face and neck:
T^is to life leads a married man.
If once to pass it comes,
That she is brought to bed,
Why then with many dainties
She must be daily fed:
A hundred toys and trifles
Comes then within her head:
This life, etc.
Against that she is Churched,
A new Gown she must have:
A dainty fine Rebato
About her neck so brave:
French bodies, with a Farthingale,
She never sins to traue,
This life, etc.
Abroad among her Gossips
Then must she daily go:
Requesting of this favor,
A man must not say no,
Lest that an unkind quarrel
About this matter grow:
This life, etc.
To Offerings and Weddings,
Abroad then she must prance,
Whereas with lusty youngsters
This gallant Dame must dance:
Her Husband must say nothing,
What hap soever chance:
This life, etc.
And then there is no remedy,
She must go to a Play,
To purge abounding Choler,
And drive sad dumps away:
She tarries out till m^dnight,
She swears she will not stay:
This life, etc.
When home at last she comes,
To bed she (...) her ^one
And there (...) full soundly,
Till the (...) moan,
Then must she eat a Cawdle
With a silver spoone:
This life, etc.
Therefore my friends be warned,
You that unwedded be,
The troubles of a married man
You do most plainly see,
Who likes not of his living,
Would he would change with me,
That now am a married man.
Where I was wont full often
Good company to keep,
Now I must rock the Cradle,
And hush the Child a sleep:
I had no time nor leisure
Out of my doors to p^pe,
Since I was a married young man.
The second Part
to the same Tune.
An answer sent to the young married Man, Written most friendly by his gentle
Wife Nan.

Alack wherefore lament you,
your happy wedded state?
Therein you show great folly,
repentance comes to late.
To make your self a mocking-stock,
with every scoffing mate,
Now you are a married young man.
In youth, do well rememnber,
your mind was all on pride:
Deceiving sport and pleasure,
your lavish thoughts did guide:
It Is time such folish fancies^
should now be laid aside,
Now you are etc.
When you lived single,
your time you vainly spent:
Unto valewfull pastime,
your yongling wits were bent:
But now you must learn wisdom,
discredit to prevent:
Since you are, etc.
An alas to estimation,
longs to a single life:
What were you but a skip Jack,
before you had a wife,
A mate for every mad-cap,
a stirrer up of strife,
Till you were a married young man.
A Wife has won you credit,
a wife makes you esteemed.
An honest man through marriage,
now are you surely deem^d,
And you shall find at all times,
a wife your dearest friend,
Now you are etc.
Then is it right and reason,
your wife should pleased be:
It is a happy household,
where couples do agree:
It does delight the Angels,
such concord for to see,
Then blessed is the married young man.
It I do blame your gadding,
it is for love be sure:
Bad company does always
ill counsel still procure.
The man that will be thrifty,
must at his work endure,
While he is a married young man.
This works his Commendations,
amongst the very best:
The chief men of the Parish,
his quaintance will request:
And then he shall be called
to office with the rest,
When he is a married young man.
He shall be made a Headborough,
unto his credit great,
At what time all neighbors,
his friendship will entreat,
And then it is most decent,
he should go fine and neat,
When he is a married young man.
Then bareheaded unto him,
a number daily stocks:
To help him by his office,
from many stumbling blocks:
Then comes he to be Constable,
and set knaves in the stocks:
Thus rises a married young man.
His wife shall then be seated
in Church at her desire,
Her Husband he is sideman,
and sits within the Quire,
Then he is made Church warden,
and placed some what higher:
Great joy to a married young man.
Then seeing all this credit
by marriage you do find,
Unto your wife it is reason,
you should be good and kind:
And sometimes wait upon her,
according to her mind:
As best fits a married young man.
If freindly you go with her
to walk out of the Town,
Why then you may have pleasure,
to give her a green Gown:
To have so great a favor,
some men would give a crown,
Which is not a married young man
As for the Pears and Apples;
you give me in the street,
The Cheries or the Codlings,
for pretty women meet,
At night I give you kindly
a thousand kisses sweet:
Great joy to a married young man.
An hundred other pleasures,
I do you then beside:
In bringing forth your Children,
great sorrow I do bide.
For twenty Gowns and Kirsles,
the like would not be tried,
By any fine young married man.
Why should you scorn the Cradle,
I tell you sir most plain,
There is not any pleasure,
but sometimes breeds pain.
If you will not be troubled,
why then good sir refrain
To play like a married young man.
FINIS.
