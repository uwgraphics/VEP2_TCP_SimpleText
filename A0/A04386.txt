vitas patrum

Here follows the right devout / much lowable / and reco^mendable lyff of
the old Ancient holy faders hermytes / late translated out of latin in to
frenshe / and dylygently corrected in the cite of lion / ye year of our
lord.M.CCCC. lxxxvi. upon that which has be written and also translated out of
Greek in to Latin / by the blessed and holy saint Saint Jerome right devout
and approved doctor of the church / and other solytarye relygyouse persons
after hy^ And after in the year of our lord.M.CCCC.lxxxxi. reduced in to
English following the copye / always under correccyon of doctors of the
church.

The Prologue of the translatour.
FOr as much as daily among the Infenyte multitude of mortal people / is
seen but few of them that live virtuously. And the contrary many in great
nombre lyuen voluptuously / and in that manner passen forth their time. This
consyderyng I have holden and reputed. And yet repute and hold well happy
them among other / which of our souerayn lord and god Ihesu christ maker
and conduytour of all things / have obtained that synguler grace yt they may
verytably say that they have lived virtuously. And that I see some to happen
in our time the which by their mellyflue and sweet eloquence have admynystred
helthfull doctrine / by the moyen of their excellent books in latin. And other
which have written and translated to our prouffyte and understanding / whereof
in so dooyng they h^^e meryted and deserved to be gretely thanked and
reco^maunded. The which thing I believe has not ben over dyffycyle ne hard to
do / seen the sublymyte and hyenes of their sharp understanding and the
fructuouse instrucco^n which they have had in lettres greek and latin. By the
aid of whom they have gotten the sovereign manner well to persuade and say.
But I which in any science am not suffycyentely Instruct. And also I have not
in me any beginning of eloquence / find my self all affrayed / doubtyng to be
repreued of over hardy presumpco^n to have so indyscretely entreprysed the
translaco^n of this present work. Nevertheless reducyng to remembrance the
proverb of the prophet saying / that fortune helps the hardy / have in my
self Iuged to be a thing lycyte and reasonable / to tempte and assaye if to the
vtylyte and common prouffyte I might make any work. By the which if I have not
virtuously lived / at lest I may say yt I have not always passed my time
vnprouffytably. And by this consyderaco^n also / that I see but little or few
persons apply them to lead solytary life / I have entreprysed to translate
out of latin in to ye Frensshe tongue the right devout and solytary life of
the au^cyent or old holy faders hermytes sometime dwelling / as well in the
great deserts of Egypt / of Thebayde / and of Mesopotamye / as in other
places / upon which have written Saint Jerome / the much auctorysed doctor of
holy church / and some other reverend faders after him. And how well that I
suppose that this work ought not to be agreeable to the redars by reason of the
fair and ornate langage / wherein is none. Nevertheless I believe that many that
shall see the great penau^ces / and meruayllous straytnes of living / in which
have perseuered all their life the said holy faders togydre / the fair and
helthfull example that been therein contained / shall employe gladly a part of
their time to read or to here it read. And further more by cause that I doubt
not / that many yt shall see this book / shall mow verytably say / that I have
not well elygantely ne dyrectely written in this present translacyon. I mekely
beseech them that they take no regard to the defaultes and mepco^ns yt they
shall find But that they consider that my little and ^eble engyne has mow
here in it dooyng. For my regard or affection has not be to employe my self
for to receive any temporel prouffyte or thank / but oonly to the end to do
thing ye some may find prouffyte thereby. Or that they yt can do better / that
it please them to correct and amend / be it in augmentyng or dymynysshyng /
like as they shall see to be done. And under this confydence. I call first
the aid of the holy ghoost / by whoos help I shall begin the declaraco^n of
ye chapytres of this present book. And after I shall proceed to the translacyon
of the prologue. And consequently of all the book / as if shall be seen by each
party of the same.

Prologue of saint Ihero^
Blessed be god our souerayn creator and dyrectour Infallyble. Which woll
that all mankind should be sauyd. and come to the perfyghte knowledge of
trouche / Which also to us has adressyd our way for to goo in to Egypt /
Where we have seen great things and merueyllous. terryble and profitable to
them that in time coming may come to the knowledge of them / And the which
things ben not to us allonely cause of the sechynge of our health. but also
they have give to us occasyon and matere for to write hystory right couenable
to doctrine of pity / The which doctrine by the faith of things passed and
told in the same / shall show way right ample and large to them that woll
walk therein. And how well that we ben not couenable ne luffisaunt to tell and
recompte so great things / And is seen not to be thing dygne ne worthy that
folk of lytyl capacyte ought to entremete to recyte in their so little and
feeble style such hystoryes which consiste in the excersyte of right hye
virtues / Nevertheles by cause that the feruente charytee of the fretes
dwelling in the holy mountain of Olyuete / have often times required us to
write to them and explyke the lives of holy Heremytes and religyouses resydent
in the deserts of Egypt. the y^ great virtues and verkes of pytee. And the
merueyllous strength of their abstynences. which we manyfestly have seen.
Hoping to be holpynge in this matere. by the right holy and deuowte prayers
and orysons of ye laid requyters. The which ben to us instead of
commandment. have entreprysed this work / In which we desire not somoche
the laud of the style. as we hope the edyficacyon in time coming of them
that shall read this history / By this ye each of them enflam^ed by thexamples
that herin ben contained shall be moeued and excyted to have error of the
wicked ordures. fylthes and vayn labors of this worlde^ and to excyte him to
rest. of conscience. and to the works of pity / Then may we say thus
says the noble clerk saint Iherom. in speaking of the said holy and devout
relygyous of Egypt. which we have seen And verily have seen the noble tresour
of Ihesu Christ hid in vessels humayn / The which tresour after we had
found it. have not wylled as enuyouse to hyde ne couere it. but the same so
found to the vtilyte and profit of many / we have will to manyfeste and make
common / Veritably acertayned that of so much that many shall be thereby
enrychyd. of so much more shall they mow have great mede and merit / Then
at beginning of this narraco^n we supplye right humbly to our worthy sauy our
Ihesu Christ that his prompt grace may be to us presented in virtue. of the
which the same works of pity have been done by the said relygyouses of Egypt
/ Ferthermore we have seen in the said country of Egypt many holy faders
living in earth. not the life humayne. but heavenly life. as new prophets
raised for to show things for to come^ So much were they full of virtues /
In the which was all efficace of verytee. as well for to bear witness of the
merytes. as for to do miracles / And no thing without cause had they such
prerogatyf of god / For he yt in all contempnyth or despisyth ye worlde^ and
all his alyau^ce / Wherefore should he not have might and puyssau^ce celestyall
and dyuyne / We have seen also some other the which were so ygnoraunte of
malice. that they knew not that any evil were done in the world. ne also
what sin was / But they were all utterly Inculpable / In them was so great
tranquylyte of courage and virtue / and so extreme affecco^n of bou^te. that
not without cause might be said to them / Pees be habundantly to the very
lovers of the name of Ihesu Christ / They dwelled in deserte dispersed and
separate that one fro that other in diverse ^elles and little howses / But by
very ^harite were they ensembled. al^ed and united / And the reyson for which
they were separate was this / By cause that by idle wyndes unprofitable.
walkyng in their vrages. or by comynycacyons not truytfull. their dyuyne and
holy contemplacon of that one or of that other be truwbled or let / And with
al their heart. and as ententyf to their devotion in their secret places fro
day to day they abode the coming of Ihesu Christ. that is to say the death.
In the which e^he one shall be Judged after his merytes / And there like as
very knights armyd of all pyeces of hameys abode the adversary of all mankind
the fend of hell / They had no manner solyeytude ne business of the life
naturell ne of bodyly necessytees. considering the great promise charytable of
our redemer / by yt which he promysyth to all them that by very Justice with
all their heart shall take pain to get the reame of heuen^ that they shall
have no need ne necessyte / And for this consyderaco^n many among hem wha^
they had any necessytees they returned to god^ as to the very conduytour
infallyble of them that run to him. And anon they have that. which they
demand / Some of them went upon the water like to saint Peter / Some of
them with their hondes sle^ve and put to death horrible bestes for to see. And
they did not oonly such miracles but other Infynyte / And such as by the
prophets and appostles had be done / Then it is to believe that sith ye time
the world has be mayntened as it is now by the holy and devout relygy onses,
which day and night pray for the universal health / But as it is so yt the
things right good ben often in little quantytee and right dyffycile /
Nevertheless al they were in the same ^^. condyco^us / For they were in great
multitude. and also they were perfyte. and of ryight holy life / Some were nygh
dwellers by citees. and other places in champestres / And other garnisshed with
virtues were separate and dysperded in the deserts / And as the excersice of
men of arms of some prince is one. they were united in charytee in their
tyguryes orcelles / And steadfastly armyd with prayer berynge the shield of
faith for sovereign defense were redi and apparaylled to fight against the
adversaries of our fragylytee / By which they took by assault the reame of
heaven / All generalli were aoumed and arrayed with virtues sweet and peasyble /
But all were togydre alyed and bound with the bond of charity. And for
Ialousye and desire for to get virtues they led and did diverse batayles For
every man labored and took pain. that one to be more sweet and soft. or more
benign than the other / That one to be more peasyble. and that other right
pacyente / If any were more wise than the other / Of so much he rendered
himself, more humble / and servant of all the other. In such wise as he
semyd to be most ygnoraunte / And so much says saint Iherom that god has
done to me such grace to see their conuersacyon. I shall set my pain after
that god shall give me the mind. for to recounte by writing their fair and
laudable manner of living / To the end that they which have not seen
corporally them. may know their holy conuersacyon and good works / By the
which they may ensyewe and led such a life like to them / And fynably may
get by very pacyence tryumphe and vyctorye in this world And in the reame of
heaven glory perdurable / Amen /

Of saint John^ the Heremyte the first chapter / which begynnyth in latin
Primum igitur /


THe noble and blessed Doctou saint Iherom Recountyth of saint John^ of Egypt.
The which was an holy Heremyte and an examplayre of all virtues. dwelling in
the parties of Thebaydes in an Heremytage set in an high roche nygh to the
cytee of Lyto / To which Heremytage might no man goo but in great pain and
labor / The church of that Heremytage was closed and shette / And therein was
the said Heremyte so long time. that fro his lx. year of age till he was
lxxx. year old that no person entered in to that church till saint Iherom
vysited him / Nevertheless to them that came thither for to vysyte him. he
spoke to them thorugh a wyndowe oonly in confortynge them / And gyuynge to
them spyrytuell refeccyon / He was never seen of woman in the said Heremytage
/ There were but few men that saw him / and that not always / But at certain
hours and days: He suffered well that a lityll hows was made without his
monastery for to lodge and rest them that came fro far regyons and
countrees for to see him / And he himself allone with in his monasterye
ocupyed him day and night without any Intermyssion with all his thought and
might to denowte o^yson and prayer / And he was so agreeable to god. that not
allonely he had the science of things present. but also of things to come /
And so hadd he the yefte of prophecy as well in the prouy^ces and cytees
nyghe by. and also in far countrees. in which he had never be To the
emperor Theodos^en he showed often times of his fortunes that he should have of
his adversaries / and how he should have vyctorye of some tyrau^^es his enmyes
In a time it happed that the Ethyopyens night a cite named Cyrene. the which
is the first of the parties. The baydes in the country of Ethyopye hadd
assyeged a knight Romayne the which had lost many of his people in bataylle.
some slain. and some take and brought in capryuyte The said knight had
little peple^ and great multitude of enmyes. feryng for that cause to assaylle
the Ethyopyens / ^ame to the said holy Heremyte for to counsel what he should
do / The why the ordained to him day of battle against his enmyes / saying to
him that if he so did he should opteyne vyctorye. and have domynaco^n of his
enmyes / As well of their bodies as of their goods / And so it happed to the
said knighte Another knight of Rome excercisyng the office of a Trybune came
to the said Heremyte. prayeng him that he and his wyffe might speak with him.
To whom he answered that his wyffe might in no wise speak with him / And that
sith he had be Heremyte never woman had seen him ne spoke with him / The
said knight abode still in his prayers / In swerynge if she saw him not.
that she were in daungeour of death / And whan^e the said Heremyte considered
his Inportunytee. and also her faith said to him / Go^ to thy wyffe: and say
to her. that in this night she shall see me But that she come not hither / But
in her bed and in her house I shall speak to her / Then went the said
Romayne / and considering in his heart the doubtous answer of the said
Heremyte showed it to his wife / The which of the Incertayntee of that answer
was strongely greuyd and ennoyed / But in the same night she slepynge saw a
vysyon of a man speaking to her. which said to her these words / O woman of
great faith for to satysfye thy desire and will I am come hither for to speak
to the / Nevertheless I admonest and warn the. that frohens fourth thou
desire not to see ye bodyly vysage of the servants of god / But allone have
thou desire for to have co^templacyon in thine heart of their virtues in good
manners / The spyryte only gyuyth life. And the flesh prouffy tyth in no
thing / I am not hid come to the as Just ne prophet like as thou wenest of
me. but for the faith of thy Husbonde and of the / I have prayed unto almighty
god for to give to the health of all thy sykenesse and maladyes^ thou shall be
hoole and guarysshed / And thou and thy husbonde and your household shall be
blessed of god / And be not unkind of the benefaytes that god has give to you
/ But dread ye him frohenforth / And demand not of him but the sustentacyon
of your life. without any other richesse / Let it suffyse to the that thou
haste seen me in slepynge / And in time coming herafter desire not to see my
body / Then when this woman was awaked she^ recounted all the caas to her
husbonde. In exposynge to him very ensygnes of his vysage. and clothing and
habyllements of the said holy fader. with many other tokenes / By the which
her Husbonde knew certainly the said visyon to be true / Wherefore he sore
amerueylled returned to the said holy fader for to render. and give thankynges
of the things before said / The which rendered he demanded of him his been
dyccyon / And after came Ioyously home to his house / In a another time a
Prouoste or Capytayne of men of war left his wyffe nyghe her time for to
child. Came for to see the said holy fader / And in the time that he aryued
in the place where as he dwelled And the same day she was in great peril for
her chyldynge / Then the holy fader forsayde aduertysed the said Prouoste.
and showed to him how she was delivered of a fair sone. and brought fair a
bed. In saying to him Thou art bound to give thankynges sovereign to god /
For thy wife which was in great daungeour. is delivered out of peril / But
haste the to return home. and thou shalt find her hoole and guarysshyd with
her child seven days old. Whom thou shalt name John^ / And thou shalt
nourysshe him seven year in thine house. without to have any comynycacion with
the Pay nyms. to the end for to keep him from their vices / The which seven
year so passyd thou shalt delyuere him to some holy relygyous man. for to
Instruct and teache the Crystyn faith and doctrine / And thus the holy man as
well to people of the prouynces nygh by him as to strangers. if they required
him gaaf good counseyle. in repreuyng them of their vices and secret sins.

He prophesied the famyne to come / for the sin of the people. and other
persecucyons coming. In excytynge the sinners to penance. and amendment of
life. And as to Inpotents and Paralytyks when they were brought to hy^ he
blessed hem with holy oyle^ of which when they were ennoynted. they recovered
health and guaryson of all their maladyes / A Senator of Rome had a wife
blind. which exorted him to lead and bring her to the said holy Heremyte /
To whom the said Senator her husbonde answered. that he would never see any
wymmen / Then^e she prayed him. that he would goo to him / And pray him to
make his oryson and prayer to god for her / For by this moyen syngulerly she
hoped to recouere her syghte / The same Senator came to this said holy man /
and after that he had made his Request He blessed a little oil / And sent
it to the said blind woman / With which she ennoynted her eyes three days
And Incontynente she receyuyd her syghte in gyuynge thankynges to god Many
other deeds worthy to be remembered did this holy man / The which should be
over long to write But saint Iherom has yet written one in this book / By
cause he him self was there present with six other brethern / The which
together came for to see the said holy man / And after they were aryued / And
that they had salwed each other / He received them with great gladness / And
spoke to each of them humbly / In admonestynge them to pray to god with him
/ As it was acustomed to the holy faders of Egypt / when any came for to
vysy^e them / Then he demanded them if any of them were a clerk / The
why^he answerde to him ^aye Nevertheless he knew in spytyte of prophecy that
one of them was a Deaken / And by humylytee he reputyd himself unworthy to be
with lo great and persyghte men as his fellows w^ee / And hid him behind
them / The holy man seenge the said Deaken. which was the youngest of them.
And showed him with his finger and said / Loo this is the Deaken The which
answered that he was no ne / Then the holy man took him by the hand and
kyssyd him and said / Haa my son deny not the grace that god has given to
the. To the end that thou take none harm for good / And for humylytee to lie
/ For above all things ^^synges ought to be eschewed. be it for good or for
euyll^ The which Deken receyuyd benygnly his correceyon /

And this done they together prayeng god / One of them had a great Feuer^ In
such wise that he supposyd to have deyed / Then he prayed the same holy man
that he might by him be heelyd and guarysshyd / To whom he answered / My
friend thou desyreste to put from the that thing which is to the necessary
to have / For like as the body is puryfyed and wasshyd by the Nytree. Which is
a spece of Salt puryfycatyff / or by other wasshynges / In like wise also is
puryfyed and heelyd the soul by maladyes and other Infyrmytees corporell /
Nevertheless after that he hadd enfourmed and taught him of many enscynements
and doctrynes. He blessed a little oil / And gaaf it to him to drink / By the
moyen of which. he cast out suddenly of his mowthe the humor causynge the
Fever / And retournyd all hoole^ and guarysshyd of his Fever / This miracle
done thus and after many other Instruccyons. and spyrytuell refec^yons to them
given by the said holy fader / He did admynystre to them that was needful /
for their refeccyon corporell / And in the mean while he wythdrewe him in to
his Celle / There being solytary by Reason /

For to write his abstynence it sholne be a thing merueyllous / For he never
ete tofore Even / And if he therme ete. it was right little / Of corpulence he
was lene by his abstynence / And he had but little here of his heed and
also of berde / As he that was in langour / By cause he ere no thing whereof
his nature might be sustained / He being of aege four score years ete no
mete that was boylled. ne by fire ne other wise / When they had take their
Refeccyons they returned to him And they being set tofore him / He demanded
for what cause they were comen thither / The which answered that for the health
of their sowles / they were comen from Iherusalem to him / And also for to see
him bodyly.

By cause of the merueyllous things which were of him to them recyted / For
more formely is retained and reduced to remembrance. that which has be
seen. thanne that which has been herd. told or spoken /

Then the holy man replenysshyd with Joy. in smiling answered / I merueylle
of you my chylderen. that ye have enterprysyd so great a way. For as ye may
see to me is no thing digne ne worthy of praysynge / Certainly I am a man
little and pooer / Having no virtue that ye ought to desire / And when it
so were that after your oppynyon ye might take in us other Hermytes any
good ensamples Yet shall not they be such ne so great. as ben thoos of the
holy prophets. and holy appostles of god / Which every day ben recited in
the church catholyke / No thing for to give ensample of good lyffe to
strangers of far countries / But to the end that each person in his own
place and Resydence Have and may have within him that which he ought to do
and ensyewe. Certainly yet I merueylle much more of the entencyon and great
affection of your labor. When for the pro^ffyte of your sowles ye have have
go ne so long away. in passing diverse Regyons so much dangerous to
walk in / And we other ben so sloth full. that we woll not part out of our
Habytacyons accustomed / But to ye end that they should not return with out
to bear with them some fruit / for the health of their souls / He enfourmyd
and taught them some enseynements / By which they might eschew the sins
of this world /

First he defended them. that they should not gloryfye theymselfe. to have been in so far countrees. for to see the holy faders of Egypt / Of which
vayn glory or Iactaunce. he gaaf them by two manners / The first when any
did any abstynence. or enlarged by alms his goods to the poor people / And
of the said good deeds is often gloryouse / Wenynge to be more Just thanne the
other / In contempnynge or dyspysynge them that been not like to him / The
second manner that the holy fader gaaf to theymis this / When a man wenyth
for his labors and virtues to be worthy to have ye Reame of heaven / And
byleuyth to have gotten the gifts of grace. and that by his propre merits. and
not by ye prouydence and bountee dyuyne / Now he must believe that who some
ever sechyth the glory of the world. he lesyth his merit and reward / And
therefore said the holy man / Let us flee vain glory. pride and auaunterye /
To then de that we fall not from heaven in to hell / As did the devil enemy
of nature humayne / And after he said my chydren be ye dylygente in eschewynge
slowthe and ydlenesse^ without having any concupyscence ne flesshly
voluptousytee / to the end if any thing be against god. that it take no rote
in you / For of those roots might come little branches / And in the end
great trees / That is to say vain and vnprouffytable thoughts / The which
when they shall be in your prayers. shall give to you heaviness and lettynge
to serve god deuotely / And your thought shall be wauerynge and vacaunte in
worldly vanytees / The desires vnprouffytable and evil wylles says the
appostle bryngyth a man unto the death if in our hertes then be any sins /
And the devil which is prince of them come to them as the y^ master / The
sins shall give hy place / If one demand wherefore it is that some have no
pees in their cons^yences. It is by cause that now they ben trowbled with one
passion and a none after wych a another. Then the reason to this for they have
received ye Prince of trybulacyon / the which has he lodged by his Herbeger.
That is sin / If then we will that god be lodged in our hertes. We shall
renounce all concupyscence carnal and flee all sin To the end that when
the devil our adversary and enmye shall come for to lodge / He shall find the
lodges taken up / and that we may say The lord is lodged within / The
varlettes may not be here / And when by virtues we have lodged him / We
always shall have Joy. charytee. patience. longamynyce / and shamefastness /
And we shall here all fruit of life. so that we ben good / And to this
purpose says our lord to his dyscyples in a parable / A good tree may
bear no evil fruit / Ne an evil tree no good fruit / And by the fruit is
known the tree / Some say that they renounce the world. but they renounce
not the sins / In having the heart clean. and the soul puryfyed from all
spotte of sin / And if some time they goo vysyte the holy men. to the end to
learn good words and hystoryes. this is not to thentente to be the better.
but for to recounte them to other / And they ben over presumptuouse. by cause
that they vaunt them to know of the yr propre wytt. that they know of the
holy and deuowte men / And desire to be reputed doctors and well manerde. by
cause they frequented the good men As done Ypocrytes and Papelars faynynge

that ouermoche ye desire them But I counseyle you that ye labor in getynge

man had admonestyd them that they should keep them from Iactaunce and

The enmye of nature which slepyth not. seenge his pride on a day laid out
his nett putting himself in the lyckenesse of a woman. walking thorugh the
deserts / The same deuylle in said lyckenesse came in the night. and knelyd
down on her knees within the Cauerne of the said Heremyte saying / ^llas my
friend I am so weary / I pray the that thou wylt herberough me for this night
/ The night has surprysed me / Have pity on me. for the wild bestes shall
denoure me. If thou suffer me to goo hens from the / And b^ th^se words the
devil constreyned the said Heremyte to have pity of him / And by cause he was
in likeness of a woman By his sweet and venemouse words / he embracyd the
said Heremyte to dysordynate love / In such wise that the devil moved the
poor man to laughe and to play / And fynably the devil approchyd so nyghe^
that he towchyd the berde. the neck and the chinne of ye monk / And at last
for to leave the cyrcumstau^ces. which is here no need to recyte. the monk
consented and purposyd in his thought to acomplysshe the syn^e of the flesh /
And after the consenting he would have proceeded to the deed / Then the
devil cried a terrible cry And left the Monk confuse and in great derysyon
/ Anon after came a multitude of deuylles cryenge abowte the house. O monk
which enhaunselte thyselfe to heaven. thou art fallen into hell. Consydre
that he that humblyth him shall be enhaunced / And he that himself enhaunsyth
shall be mekyd / The poor monk seenge this Illusyon made to him by the
devil. As a fool and Inconstaunt. and not thinking on god. which is all god
/ And that pardon^yth lightly him that woll refoume toward him by penance:
begylyd himself yet more / For he left his Hermytage. and ladde fourth a
seculer lyffe / And was made a p^oye for the devil / The which thing he
ought not to do / but he ought in his courage to weep and wayle in dooynge
penaunce^ For to obtain Remyssyon of his sin. For if he hadd so done
without doubt. he hadd gotten the ye^te of grace and pardon of his wyckydnesse
/ Also the said good Heremyte recounted an another Hystorye of a man dwelling
nyghe the cytee of ^yto. in the parties of Thebayde. the which after he hadd
lived a lewd life. and Infamyd as toward god and to the world He went and
putt himself in to a secret place. for ^o do penance in weeping and teeres.
In which he continued day and night for to have remyssyon of his sins /
And mayntened himself so humbly. that he durst not lift up his eyes to
heaven / After that he had thus continued a weke in this penance / By night
came the deuylles in to the place where he was. in cryenge ayenste him / What
do thou here man Infamed. which haste ben all thy life lewd and lecherous
/ Will thou be now chaste and relygious / Thou which haste all thy life lived
in slythernesse of the world / Weneste thou to have space to do penance
condygne for to have foryeuenesse of thy sins / Thou art all ready a devil
like to us. Return and achyeue the remenaunt of thy life in voluptuosytee and
playsaunce / We have made ready for the delyces enough. will thou flee thyselfe
in the torments which thou haste begone / Come again with us in to the
world / Thou shalt have no more pain in hell thanne thou haste now / And
all this the poor man herd. as immovable without any thing to answert.
Anon the deuylles this seenge buffeted and beat hy^ with diverse strokes / And
left him as half deed / But notwythstondynge all this he departed not fro
his place / On the morn sum of his friends that sought him found him
tormented thus / And demanded of him from whens proceeded this afflyccyon and
punysshment which he hadd receyuyd / And after that he had told to them all
the ^^as / They prayed him that he would let and suffer him to be brought by
them in to his house. for to recouere his bodyly health To which he would not
consent / But abode stylle in his propre place.

Anon after. and the night following the deuylles came again / And beat him
more thanne before / And nevertheless he departed not / Considering that more
it should auaylle him there to suffer the death / thanne to obey to the
deuylles / The third night came again a gretter multitude of deuylles thanne
any time tofore / And of them he was vexed and beten / that there abode no
more but oonly his spirit. Which resysted them / The which they seeing
began to cry with an high voyse. Thou haste overcome us. Thou haste
vaynquysshyd us /

And Incontynente. as they had been huntyd. by the virtue of god they departed
/ And after they never returned to him / And after the good holy man
prouffyted so much. that he was replenysshyd with grace and virtue. In such
wise that all the Regyon reputed him so holy. as if he had descended from
heaven. In saying / Loo this is the mutacyon or change of the right hand of
god.

And thus by the examples before said we may know how humylyte and conuersyon
is cause of all good / And by the contrary exaltacyon and pride. of all evil
/ And fynably of dysperacyon / And for to observe more lightly this rule / The
said holy man told a another example of a monk / the which dwelled in a place
more derke and obscure than all the other / In which he passed his yongthe and
aege in penance In such wise that he was flowrynge in all virtues / And was
so agreeable to god. that he being in this mortal world. The angels were by
the Commandment of god obeyenge to / And admynystred to him by his lyffe /
That is to wit Refeccyon corporell / For when his nature was greuyd by
hungre / He entered in to his Cauerne / And there by prouydence dyuyne / The
bread was ready set on the table / of much more gretter swetnesse thanne the
bread materyall / which is made in the world / And when be had taken for
to sustain nature / He returned to prayer. for to Render and give thankynges
to our souerayn lord god /

To which Heremyte many reuelacyons of things to come were showed / But after
he fell in to vain glory for his demerytes / And became slow and neclygent in
his prayers / And prayed not to god so much deuowtely as he had been
accustomyd / And as he was ennoyed to continue his prayers. He thereby ran in
to slowthe and Infamye. and in to lecherous thoughts / And nevertheless he so
being made his prayers. as he was accustomyd to do / And entering in to his
Cave he found bread as tofore / The which was not so fair. but fusty and
spotted. Then he admerueylled and was heavy and sorry / By cause this bread was
not like ne so good. as it had been before / And the third day after he
being maculate by vain thoughts / supposed verily in his mind to have seen
the image of a young woman: And then him semyd that he embracyd and also
kyssyd her. In making foul attowchynges / This notwythstondyng / the day
following he returned in to his prayers / But (...)

Saint Iherom says. that he saw a another holy man much honorable. nyghe
unto the regyon of Thebayde named Hor / which was fader and abbot of many
monasteryes. And was four score and ten years of aege / Having a long berde
and white heeres. and Joyous after the Judgment of his face / And to the end
that the brethern dwelling in the Foreste had none occasion for to goo far
for to seche their bodily necessytees / He planted in places nighe the
monasteryes trees berynge fruit. In which places tofore he dwelled there hadd
never tree be planted / And if he was much besye for their refeccyons
corporell /

Much more without comparison had he more affection unto the spyrytuell
refeccyon / It is said that charytee begynnyth at himself / He ete not of that
which his brethern ete / For oonly he vsyd roots and herbs for his mete. and
for his drink oonly clear water / if he fond it in ocupyenge himself al day
and night in fastings and prayers / When he was come to maturytee and
rypenesse of his a^ge / An angel apperyd to him in a vysyon. saying to him /
Many men to the obeissaunte shall bileue the / Great multitude of people as
thousands shall be saved by the And after the angel said to him. that in time
to come he should have domynacyon. upon as many men as he had converted / And
that he should dread no manner thing / For all that he should demand of god
he should opteyne /

When the holy man had herd all thys^ he went in to a ^elle the which he
hadd made for himself / And there he vsyd for his sustentacyon but cool
wortes after that he hadd long fasted And notwythstondyng that he ne cowde
read ne write / Nevertheless his brethern whom he vysyted in places adjacent
and nyghe to his Hermytage. presented to him a book / In which as he had
known all by heart he radde lyightly / He had puyssaunce upon the deuylles. in
chacynge them out of the bodies of men / And by virtue of his prayers he
guarysshyd and heelyd them / Many other Hermytes and relygyous men came to him
/ Among which saint Iherom came. whom he received benyngly. and prayed him
that he might wasshe his fete. like as he had be acustomyd to do to his
ghestis His custom was never to receive his refeccyon corporal. till that he
had received his maker / On a time among other after that he had receyuyd
his creator. saint Iherom aryued / He exorted his brethern and saint Iherom to
take their refeccyon corporell / In which refeccyon he spoke of god and of his
works. without to speak of any vanytees. like as we do. After ye refeccyon
take he recounted many hystoryes of holy Heremytes / And first of an holy man
which was three year co^tynuelly without etynge of any mete / of this world /
but from three days to three days. an aungel brought to him heavenly meet / Of
which oonly he was sustained and fed. without taking of any other thing /
After this he recounted to them a another historye / In saying that he had
seen so holy an Heremyte. To whom the cruel deuylles came in likeness of
angels bringing a charyott a^urned and arrayed as for a great lord / In which
charyott was one of the deuylles habyl lyd like a king. the which said to
him / Come now hither good man thy penance is accomplysshed / There is now
no more to do but thou adoure and worship me / To the end that I enhaunce the
in this charyott. like as Hely was / But the good Relygious Heron thinking was
admerueyled / and said to himself / Eeuery day I adoure my god / And now he
woll pray that I adoure him / He knowyth well that I serve him day and night
with all my power / I believe that this is not my god / And therefore he said to
the same devil I have my king whom contynuelly I adoure / Wherefore I believe
that thou art not my lord sovereign / Then ye deuylles saw his constaunce
and humylyte went all away confused / Saint Iherom says notwythstondynge the
holy man Hor in recountynge this hystorye applied it to be happed to a another
person than to him / Nevertheless the brethern affermyd the same Hor. to be it
himself / But by his great humylyte. he atrybuted his perfecco^n to a another /
When any men came for to dwell with hy^ / he was so pyteuouse of them that he
called his brederrn. and did them for to make an house for them.

There some made mortere. other made tyles / And by cause his brethern seenge
his charytee. enjoyed them to be with him / He did not as some done in thise
days. which demand great quantite of money for to receive some relygyous in
their house. but he delyuerde to them at his dyspence and his brethern house and
vtensyles / On a time it happed that one of his brethern a stonge liar came to
him. the which had rent his robe / to the end that the good abbot should see
him nakyd. for to have one new / Then^e the holy man knowing by Inspyracyon
his Inyquite and falsenes repreued him tofore all his brethern / And never
after durst he lie tofore him / And for fynall conclusyon. he was of so great
virtues and me rytes^ that from all parties came to hy^ holy and devout
relygious men for ye excellence of his virtuous life. In which ought to take
ensample all men of Relygion /

REcyteth saint Iherom of an other holy fader dwelling in ye said regyon of
Thebayde. the which was abbott and fader of three thousand relygious persons
of merueylous abstinence. called Thebenesiens. He commanded to the relygiouses
to here ye vestyment large of which they couerd their heed. and was called
Scapulari and to have an other vestyment. which was called Frocke. which in
likewise couerde their face when they should sytt at table. to the end the one
should not repreue that other if any ete more or less / Those relygiouses
held so great scylence in drinking and etyng. yt it cowde not be know that
if any person were in the place where they took always their refecco^n / And
notwythstondynge that they were in great multitude / they were so secret in
then works. that the one knew not the abstine^ce of that other / Nevertheless
they were more abstynent of the metes set tofore them. than to have
affection to ete ne to drink. without to make of their belly their god /
Herupon we ought to consydre. that it is more great abstynence to see mete.
and little to ete of it than to be without me^e. and not desire it / In like
wise they that been now relygious ought to rule them in sobrenes and in
abstynence. in eschewynge envy regnynge in cloystre / Also their abbot ought
to restrain them / And himself ought first to refreyne himself for to
give ensample to his relygiouses

Saint Iherom recountyth after this. that he and his fellows saw an other
abbot ancient the which surmou^ted all men in swetnesse and humylyte named
Benon. of whom his bredern witnessed that he had never sworn. ne made lesynge
/ Also a thing which is much to be merueyled / He had never be angry against
any person living. ne never had spoke idle word / His life was so peasyble.
and of so great humylytee. that he was living as angels lyffe / And as saint
Iherom writes when he and his fellows required him to have of him some words
edyficatyff for the soul. with great dyffyculte might they get of hy^ some
short words. which he recyted to them of the virtue of Clemence and
swetnesse / On a time he was required of the laborers of the country there by
his monastery to pray god. that it pleased him to chase away a beeste. ye
which destroyed all their labors /

Anon he came to the place where as that beeste was / And commanded him in
the name of god to depart and go fro thens / And that he should never after do
harm to the graynes of that country / And Incontinent like as he had be
chacyd away by an angel of he^uen. he fled away / And never after he
returned in to that country / Here upon ought to be noted that scylence is
good for to eschew many sins / And pryncypally unto relygyous persons and
to abbottes /

Saint Iherom says after. as he and his fellows came in to the cytee of
Exirynque. in the Regyon of Thebayde / wpyche is a cite full of virtuous men.
that no man may recounte / And there were so mani relygious within and
wythouth ye none might nombre / And so many monasteryes that they exceded the
houses And there were found xii. Couentes without other places of devotion.
the which frequented in certain days in such wise we fond. that there ne
was gate. tour. ne so little a place in the cite. but there was therein an
Oratory of relygiouses and monks singing night and day hympnes and
praysynge to Ihesu Christ / There was found in ye town never Heretyke ne
Paynym.

All the town was so full of Oratories: that there was no dyfference in
prayenge. as well in ye streets as in the church / For all were as one church
and one Oratory / All the cyteyzyns were good Christian and. catholyke men / For
the pry^cypall masters and governors of the said cite by all the yates of the
cite had also founded Oratoryes. to the end yt when pilgryms or strange folk
came thither. the. relygiouses being in them should receive them. and
admynystre to them their necessytees / Ferdermore said saint Iherom. yt he
cowde not recyte yt. which was done to him and to his fellows when they entered
in to that cytee For they cam^ to hem like as they had been angels. doing to
them great honor. and right humain service. He says also yt they demanded
of the bishop of yt place the nombre of the relygiouses of ye cite. and also
of the virgynes. The bishop answered yt there were x.M. men / and xx.M.
virgynes in ye cite religyous and religiouses. of whom it was inpossible to
recou^te thonour and service yt they would do to pilgiyms passing thereby / For
in likewise as saint Ierom writyth they rent their mantels and vestyments for
to lead them by force in to their howses / for to refresshe them / In ye
cytee were people full of diverse virtues. there some in words. other in
abstinences^ the other in signs and miracles / Alas now ben there few cytees.

Saint Iherom says yt he saw a another holy man named apolonyen in Thebayde.
nigh to a cite named Hermopolis / In yt which cite as we read after ye prophet
Ysaye our saupom with his intemerate and holy mother and Joseph came for to
dwell. leuyng the parties of Iudee / In ye cite saw saint Iherom the temple
in which there had be many ydols. when our lord entered therein. but at his
coming all fell in to ruin / The same holy man had his hermitage in a
mou^tain. about which were many monasteries settnye to the said cite. and the
said Apolonien was souerayn of v.L.relygious men full of virtues / By hy^ were
made every day in the virtue of our lord many great merueylous works. Fro ye
time of his yongth he was nourysshed in abstynence unto thage of lxxx. year. in
which aege he was when saint Iherom cam^ to see him / His co^uersaco^n was so
good that by the moyen thereof and of his merits toward god. that his discyples
were also perfyte as he hy^self / And when he had be by the space of xl. year
in thermytage. he herd a voys fro heaven saying to him / O Apolonyen by the
shall be lost the science of the sages of Egypt. that is to say / that they
yt ben reputed sage and wise among the Babilonyens and all their ydolatrye
shall be by the brought to naught and confounded / Goo in to the country
habytable in leuynge thy hermytage / For you shall co^uerte ye people forto serve
god. to ensiewe good maneres / and leave their detestable vices and da^pnable
ydolatries / Then^e ye holy man prayed to god yt he should not be tempted with
no vaynglory / when he shall have converted somoche people / The voys answered I
command the that you lay thihonde upon thy heed. and that you cast in to the
duste ye which you shall find there the which thing he did / And anon he
took a lityll Monstre like a black Ethiopien. and cast him in the dust. The
which monstre cried / I am ye devil of pride prince. and by yt he knew ye he
had lost all pryde^ like as he had put it under his foot. This thing thus done
ye voyse of heaven said to him now goo with ye me^. for all that you shall ask of
god shall be granted to ye without fawte. Then^ he went unto the places where
as dwelled other heremytes / And thise things happed in the time of Iulyan the
tyrau^t / Now he had a fosse or a pytt nigh by an hermitage. in which he abode
then^ in prayenge god incessauntly / And at leest a hundred times a day he
knelyd on his knees / and asmany times by nyt There he lived more by heavenly
mete / than by bodily. His vestyment was only of lyn^en like ye frocke of a
monk. and that whereof he covered his heed and his neck was of a another manner
like a scapulary / yt which vestyme^tes never payred in desert. but were all
his life al hole / The holy man was in that place as a spirit living in
pouerte / doing so many miracles ye no tongue can recou^te. For his holiness
he was hold and reputed of ye people of the country as an apostle^ or an holy
prophet / All the religiouses and hermytes of the regyons adjacent came to hy^
as to there fader. and gaaf to hy^ their souls for to govern / He taught hem
to do well. to estudie. and to abstynence after her possybilyte / But first in
ensewyng the doctrine of Ihu^ christ he observed them such as he would be for
to keep hem. to the^de yt. they should not refuse. but live after his example /
Sometime ye religyous persons be^ evil. by cause yt her pastor is of evil

The good holy man after admonested always his bredern to resist ye te^ptaco^ns

syn^e. ye shall resyste all vices / for who resystith the herd he may lightly
resyst and gainsay ye me^bres / With this he exhorted hem to vaynquisshe each
other / in surmou^tyng eueryche his brother in virtues / For he say de ye
eueryche ought to desire to be more perfyte than his neyzbour. and also he said
yt the man is more perfyte in virtues yt is not subdued ne vaynquysshed by
worldly te^ptaco^ns: for to resyst ye sins and foul wylles is the begyn^yng
of the yeftes of god / And after he said to hem. if any of you do any miracle /

and if the said holy man had excellent grace in doctrine yet more great had he

this many reuelaco^ns were showed to him. Among the which of one of his
fellows with whom he had long time vsyd. his life was showed to him yt he was
in heaven in the sete of thapostles. and in like glory A another time he praye^g
for hy^self to god yt it would pleyse him tabrdge his days. and to bring him
in to the reame of heaven. God showed to him yt he should be yet a little time
in the world for to be an example of virtues to many other hermytes. which by
him should be enformyd in holy co^uersaco^n and as it was showed to him. so it
happed / For after yt came to him many hermytes fro diverse places and
countries. which ensewyd him in doctrine and in virtues. in such wise ye many
renounced the world for to follow him. and made a monastery in ye said
mou^tain. where as they lad a life common / And those religyous men were clean of
body and of soul. and notwythstondyng that they were in Egypt. where as
habounded syn^e and malice. Yet were they virtuous and reputed as angels / And
thereby is verefyed ye saying of thapostles. saying yt where as habou^dith syn^e
there also habou^deth grace. Now out to be noted that thabycau^ts of the said
Egipte. by their great ydolatry worshipped the oxen. by cause they labored the
feldes by which they lived / and also they worshypped the water of the river
of Nyle by cause it watered and aroused ye regyons of Egypt / In like wise they
adoured the earth as the most fertyle of all other. the dogs also. apes. and
diverse herbs / And the reyson whi moved he^ so to do. was by cause they
said. that ye diverse ocupaco^ns that they had. some to ere the land. and
other to nouryssh her dogs and apes. other to plant herbs / and so of other
operaco^ns had be cause yt they in besines had be let and empesshed that they
went not with Pharao and were not drowned with him. when he entered in to the
reed see. wenynge to have persecuted the chyldner of Israel. which had
happened to them. if they had not be tarried by the moyen of the said operaco^ns
/ And for asmoche as that hadd be cause of her preseruaco^n and health they
worshypped hem as gods / After this ye before is written of the doctrine of ye
holy man. now rests to-see of his works and operaco^ns Then^e it is to be
noted that among his other works. he saw in a temple of a cite nyghe by his
hermytage an ydolle^ which sometime was by prestes and other people born in
processyon for to obtain vberte and habu^dance of rain / The which thing
seenge the holy man and moved with pity made his prayed to god for to take this
foul creau^ce and mysbyleue fro them. His prayer so made they and their
ydoll abode all immovable in such wise yt they might not move ne go froward ne
backward / And were there all yt day with out departing frothens / in
suffrynge and susteynynge the bren^ynge of the son^e / Then^e the priests said
yt the orysons and prayers of ye holy christian man yt dwelled there by their
cite named Apolonyus was cause yt they might not moeuene depart thens / And if
they were not lo^ourd by him. they should long time tarry and abide there / And
then^e some of them said. yt it might well be truth by cause that then^e he
passed forth by. Nevertheless they brought many oxen wenynge for to move
thydoll. but they cowde not make him for to depart fro the place. fynably they
sent to the holy man. and promised hy that if he would deliver them fro the
pain in which they were. they should renounce their gods and believe in Ihu^
christ / Then^e cam^ the holy man to them. and made his prayer. ye which made
they were all delyuerd fro their trybulaco^n / And for this miracle some of
them abode with hy^ in his hermytage. and other went in diverse places showing
and publysshynge this miracle. by cause whereof they converted he^ to the
christian faith / And anon but right few dwelled in that regron / but they were
converted to the faith A another miracle worthy to be remembered did the said
holy man as here folowyth / Two towns on a time had war one against a another.
by cause of the bounds and lymytes of their lands. of which yt one was
christian and that other paynym / By cause of this dyuysion were assembled of
that one part and that other man / men of war The which thing seenge the
holy man was moved by charity. enforced him tacorde and appese them togider /
Then^e one which was named for chief of the said paynyms / and cause of the
war. said that never he would acorde unto the death / The holy man answerde.
then^e be it so in such wise as ye demau^dest / None shall deye but thyself.
and thou shall have sepulture such as aperteyneth to the / For you shall be
buried in the belyes of bestes and birds. and so it befell / For he was found
deed alone upon therth. all detrenched and devoured with bestes^ and all
the other were abashed how the word of ye holy man was so verytable / And for
that cause they began to dread the god of the holy man. and were all converted
to the christian faith leuynge their ydolatrye / Now shall we speak of a another
miracle. which he did at the begyn^ynge when he rendered himself in to a
cauern or cave with certain bredern / In an holy day of Ester. he being at
the table with his bredern. after ye service aco^plisshed. instead of delycate
mete he hadd a little dry bread and wortes of chool made with a little salt
only / And ye seenge the homan said / if we ben the true servants of god and
have very faith. we shall opteyne by our prayers / that which we desire to ete
in this holy sole^pnyte / Then the bredern by humylite answered yt he alone as
the most worthy and virtuous should make the prayer / and so he did at their
request in prayeng devoutly / His oryson acco^plysshed. and after yt they had
answered Amen / came suddenly to thate of their hermitage men unknow / and as it
semyd of strange country charged with all metes yt they might desire / There
some had apples of diverse sortes^ raysyns nottes and figs in great habu^dance
/ the other had honey tofore the time yt it cowde be made naturelly / milk great
quantyte. with hoote bread and good.

And when they had presented their ye^tes. incontinent they went a way as if
they had be sent fro some great lord.

Here ought to be noted. yt such things were none in Egipte. and also they yt
brought them were also unknow / and were not of ye mayntene ne of ye langage
of the country / Wherefore it may surely be byleuyd yt it was a very miracle /
When the said relygious men had ete suffycyently. they rendered tha^king to god
/ and kept the residue. which endured for their refeccyon fro yt day of ester
till ye feast of pentcost / It is no syn^e then^e to ete delycate metes / when
it is take sobrely / And by yt one is not moeued to syn^e / It happed afterward
ye one of his bredern prayed hy^ to make a request to god. yt it would plese him
to give to him very humylytee / by cause he was proud and without clemence /
The holy man anon made his prayer devoutly for him. and incontinent he was so
humble and meke yt all his bredern merueyiled. In ye time it happed yt there
was great famine and hu^gre in the parties of Thebayde. so great that they wist
not what to ete. Some with their wives came to the holy man / For they knew
well yt oftymes by ye grace of god with out mete the relygious were fedd and
sustained / And when ye holy man saw he^ he doubted no thing / but had
confyde^ce in god. which had enough for to nourysshe them / Now there he had
three baskettes with bread / which was suffisau^t for the bodily sustentaco^n
of ye religyous men there only for one day / Which baskets and bread. he
did do set in the mids among them / and the benedycco^n made. by ye grace
of god they lived by ye said bread / by ye space of four months all they yt
by the constreynt of the famyne were come thither / An other time he did a like
miracle / on ye oils and in whete / in multeplyenge above ye therth had
brought forth / The devil seeng this. said to him. I wene perfytly that you art
Helyas or thapostle of god / ye holy man answerde / Wherefore say you such
words / thapostles and prophets. were not they men as we ben / ye which have
left us in their place. we nest you not ye god was with them. and now he is
with us. he is and shall be almighty. if god be good. wherefore art you evil.
let us remember the things tofore wrytt / how they ben worthy of great
remembrance. the which ben verefied by the witness of the holy man / Then
restith now to write of the miracles of the said holy man / which saint Ierom
saw / On a time in the presence of ye said saint Ierom. the holy man did do
bring to the table ye baskettes full of bread / But when he had distrybuted
and set it upon the table / And that every man had take his refeccyon the
said baskettes were again fyllyd. and full as they were before / A another time
the relygious bredern walked for to see the said holy man. Among whom was
saint Iherom / And three days tofore the said bredern came to ye place where as
the holy man was. the said holy man showed to bis bredern relygyous. that the
bredern were coming fro Iherusalem in to their house / and wha they knew their
approchyng^ they came against them in singing. some before and some after /
And in like wise did the holy man the which also washed their fete. and did
to them many other seruyces. like as they were accustomed. And saint Iherom
says that they never ete till that they had received their maker And after
their re^^^^ take / some went in to desert / the other abode in wakyng / and
ocupyeng theymself all the night in holy scripture. And notwithstondyng that
they were out of worldly Joy. yet had they more e^^ltacon / than any man
living in the world / For where as is Joy in to science. there is always
Joy / Never was there any of them heavy ne sorrowful / The holy man said to
them often it is of necessytee. if ye he Just and ryghtfull that ye be always
Joyous / Let ye paynims laid he weep and the hethen men and sinners / Also
know ye for certain that they ye love worldly things rejoice them in
getynge lands and possessions / We then^e that get. and have hope to have the
glory eternal. ought always to be Joyous / For the glory and goodness that
we entende to have shall be without end / And they that entende the worldly
things. is but of little endurynge / Wherefore we ought to be more Joyous than
they that been worldly. Thus counseylith the appostle. that says that we ought
to rejoice us contynuelly in giuyng thankynges to god with all our thought /
He gaaf also counseylle that if any brother relygyous gooth to see one that
other / He ought not oonly to pray him to abide and tarry / But to constreyne
him / Like as Abraham in receyuynge the pylgryms Constrained them by charity
to soiourne in his house / He commanded also to his bredern to receive their
maker / to the end that they should not wythdrawe them fro the grace of god /
For in so doing they should contynuelly remember the passion of Ihesu Christ
In like wise he commanded them expressly to fast the Wenesdaye. by cause
that the same day Judas machyned the death of Ihesu Christ / And in like wise
the Frydaye / For that day he received death and passion / The holy man blamed
much the heremytes. which had long here and berde. and y^ons on their necks
/ For he said that they did not that. but for the glory of the world / And
also the co^mau^demente of god is. that fasting and prayer be done pryuely /
For god oonly ought to know the good deeds that we done / And after saint
Iherom and his fellows took his benedyccyon / And he delivered to them some of
his burdern for to conduyce them thorugh the deserts /

Of saint Ammon thermyte / which slew a dragon. and converted the thieves. and
begynnyth in latin Que an diuimus / Caplm viii.


Saint Iherom wrytyth that he and his fellows came to a place / where as
dwellid saint Am^on in walkyng through ye desert toward ye South / They saw in
their way the trace of a great serpent merueylousli of xv. cubytes of length.
the which fered them greatly / But the bredern yt conduyted them comforted
them in exortynge them to have good hope saying / Ye shall know what is our
faith. when ye shall see the dragon slain by us / We have slain many bestes. be
ye no thing afride. we have credence in god. which has said yt we shall have
domynaco^n upon ye serpents and dragons. and upon all our enmyes / and what
someuer thing yt the bredern said. saint Iherom and his fellows were aferde.
in prayeng them yt they should goo no more by the way of ye dragon / but should
goo seek a another way / Nevertheless one of hem without dread went fourth the
same way / A another brother came ye which warned he^ and also the brother yt
followed the dragon yt they should goo no ferder. for he was so feerfull ye uneath
durst any behold hy^. Finably all they went in to ye monasterye of ye brother
yt was thereby / ye which told to them yt nigh to his house was a devout man
much famous / of who^ he was dyscyple. and by whom many miracles had be done
and showed. That same man was named Am^on / and by cause some thieves had done
to him much pain. in robbyng fro hy^ his bread and his sustenau^ce /
commanded to it. dragons yt they should keep the door of his monasterye to
the^de yt the thieves should have no power tentre in / The thieves cam^ like as
they were wont to do / and when they saw the dragons. they would have slain
them / Then^e ye holy man aperceyuyd yt the bestes were almost deed^ and
blamed ye thieves saying yt there were of hard and evil nature. for they dradd
not god ne his servants. by cause yt they had putt to death ye bestes yt he
had co^mysed to keep his house After he did do enter ye thieves in to his house.
and set hem at ye table and in time while they ete. he amonested hem of the
health of her souls / in such wise yt he converted hem / And at last they
were as perfect as ye holy man which had preched to hem / A another time there
was a dragon that destroyed all the Regyons nyghe by abowte hy^ And the
Inhabytauntes neighbors to the holy man came to him / And brought to him the
son of a Heerd man / The which was as deed oonly by the syghte of the said
dragon / And prayed him that he should pray to god hertely / to the end that
by his prayers and merytes the child might be raised to life / Then^e the holy
man blessed him. and gaaf to him of ye holy oil and anon he reuyued and came
again to life / And after the holy man went to the place where yt foresaid
dragon was And when he had fond. him he knelyd down on his kne^s for to make
his prayer / and Incontinent that the dragon aperceyued him he came to him
siflinge. and enforcyng him by great Impetuosite for taproche the said holy man
for to devour him / But as he ye drad him no thing said to him. The sone of
god at this time come for to slay the / And incontinent the dragon cleft in
the mids. and deyed suddenly / After he was deed he stanke / and enfected all
the country / The habytauntes assembled them. And brought a great mass of
eithe to lay on him / But yet they durst not approach the place where he lay

any do to us dysplaysure. we ought not to take vengau^ce, but wroughte to
labor for to convert our enmye and adversary. like as this holy man did to
the thieves / Secondly yt every man ought to labor for to conserve and keep
the common well unto ye death / Like as this holy man did wha^ he adventured
himself to slay the dragon /

Of saint Coprete priest and Heremyte / And begynnyth in latin Erat quidam /
Caplm ix.


THere was an holy man in ye same hermitage named Coprete of lxxx. year of
aege. the which in his saye^ges and deeds was much virtuous. He heled hem yt
were seek. and chaced the deuylles out of men^es bodies. and did many miracles
/ Some he did us ye presence of saint Iherom. which for his great reno^mee
went to see him. and was of hy^ much humaynly received After yt saint Iherom
and his fellows hy^ prayed yt he would recou^te to hem of his faytes and his
deeds. and also of his merits for which he made so many miracles and works /
Then^e he recou^ted of hy^self and his predecessors / but as touchy^g hy^self
he nas as touchy^g to virtues but a disciple of chau^ciens. And yt said he by
humilite / First he told of a fader named Mucins. which first had he
heremyts in ye said hermytage. and had beg^n first to show ye way of hel^h /
but at he was heremyte he had ^e ye strongest ^heyf in s^tree. and such was
his co^uersaco^n / It happed on a night yt he supposid to have pylled and
robbed the house of a vyrgine sacred / And by cause he might not lytly enter
in. he mounted upon the couerture and tylyng of the house and was the ^^soo
long yt he slept there / He being thus a sleep herd a voys which said to
him / Less evil man of thy murdres and pylleries. and convert the to lead a
solytary life / And if yt so do I shall make ye prince and lord over many
knights / and he being yet a sleep in his dreme / was showed to hy^ a great
multitude of hermytes / And the voys commanded him yt he should be their
governor / After the said theyf awoke and saw tofore him the maid which he
would have robbed. Then^e the maid said to him. Alas ^m friend who are ye. fro
whens come ye. and wherefore be ye here come / And the man as without any
entendement answerde no thing / But only demanded that she should show him
ye way to some church. for he demanded only to be in a monastery / The maid
then knew that this came fro god / And brought him to the church. and
delyuerd him to the priest / To whom the said man prayed that he might be
cristned knelyng down on his knees tofore the priest / And requyryng place in
which he might do his penance With this he demanded the commandments. by
the which he mit walk in ye way of hell the / The priests seenge this were
abashed. by cause they knew him to be a theyf and full of all sin.
merueyled of this thing / And this notwystondyng they delyuerd to him three the
first verses of the first psalm of the psaulter yt is to say Beatus vir. Sed
in lege dn^i. Et erit tanqua^ lignu^ / The which verses by hy^ considred said.
yt they suffysid to bry^ge a man to everlasting life / After yt he had be three
days with them he went in to an hermitage. and when he was in desert. he ete
no thing but rotes. and kept right dyligently the virtues which the prestes
had delyuerd and give to hy^. and not only in wordes^ but also by effect and
operaco^ns / And after this he returned to them. which were much abashed
how suddenly he was become so virtuous. in ledyng so hard and strayte a life /
and they constreyned hy^ for to dwell emonge them / Then^e he wyllyng not to
dysobey soiournod with them a weke^ yt which passed he returned in to desert
/ And was there vii^ year in great abstynence. and in keeping holy scripture /
and ete no thing but bread / and that on ye son day / Which bread was
mynystred to him by grace divine / For when he rose fro prayer. he fond ye
bread all ready without bryngyng of any person / His refecco^n take. he ete
no more till the next sunday following. After long time he returned fro desert /
and many were by him converted to penance. Among who^ a young man cam^ to him
for to be his dyscyple / Then^e clad hy^ the holy man with thabyte of hermytes.
which was of the skyu^e of a ghote / and after enfourmyd him with the rules of
heremytes Hrewith he had great business to bury ye deed bodies if any had
passed out of this world / Wha^ the child yt was his discyple saw his
spirytuel fader thus bury ye deed men. in clothyng them honestli Then^e said
he I would well yt my fader should clothe me thus when I were deed And the holy
man said to him. so shall I do. and shall give to the asmoche as yt shall say
it suffyseth / After a little time the child deyed. and was buried with his
fair fader / And when he had wrapped him in fair vestyments. he demanded him
if it suffised / The child that was tho deed answered tofore al them yt were
presence there ye / and that he had ynouz. and that his promise was
aco^plysshed / Then^e all they that were present were much admerueylled /
After yt the child was buried. the holy fader returned in to his hermitage /
and wha he had be long time there. he came again to vysyte his bredern. and in
cominge it was showed to hy^ yt one of hem was in deyeng And by cause it was
late. he hasted hy^ for to see him at leest or he deyed. for he was far fro
the place where the seek man lay / and that did he considering yt our lord
says / yt we out to walk while we have light. For who yt walks in light /
yt is to say in instyce. he offe^dyth not god / and therefore by cause ye the
son^e declu^ed and theuynge came on. He co^masided to the son^e in ye name of
god yt he should carry and give his light. unto the time that he were com^ unto
ye place where ye seek man was / And anon ye son^e tarried and abode unto the
time yt he was come / Then^e the bredern were abashed and demanded at his
coming frowhens proceeded the tarienge of the son^e / And he answered ne
remember ye not yt our lo^ue says / yt who someuer has somoche faith as the
greyne of mustard / of which of one grain come and proceed infynyte greynes.
etc^ Anon the bredern vnderstoden. that it was by his merytes yt the son had
be fixed in his syege and trone / And when he was entered to to ye place where
as the seek man was / for whom he had so hasted for to come. he fond him deed
/ And incontynente the holy man Mucyns kyssed him. in demau^dyng him / Answer
to me my brother / Whether had thou lever ^e deed with Ihu^ Christ. or to
come and live again in this world / And the b^odder answerde / Alas my fader
wherefore demaundest thou me this questyon / Thou know well. that it is of
necessite. that I be with my god / For. for to be in the world nys but myserye
/ Fader hermyte said he then to him / Now goo thy way then^e my sone / and
pray for me Then^e the brother laid him down again in the bed. as he had
slepte / Of which thing they that were present were much abashed / For they
knew well that he was a man of God and of holy life / And this done the holy
fader cladde the corpse like as he was acustomyd to burye them that were deed /
and walked all the night in prayers / And after the said holy man went to
vysite a another brother that lay on deyenge / And by cause that this brother
doubted to be reproved of his life tofore god / Prayed the holy man that he
would get of god that his days might be prolo^ged / to the^de yt he might
amend his life / ye holy fader answered / What have yt do al the life / Have you
had no space to do penance. you would never less thy sins. but always haste
augmented he^. notwythsto^dyng said ye holy man i^ you wylt promise came^de thy
conscience and satysfye for thy sins we shall pray god for ye. and they put
be^ al to prayer. and anon after ye holy man had prayed the life of the brother
to be prolo^ged three year Then^e ye holy man raised him out of his bed. and the
friar being al hole went with him in to deserte / And wha^ ye iii. years were
aco^plysshed he brout hy^ again in the place where he had take hy^. ledyng mo^e
the life of an angel than of a man. Whereof all ye bredern were admerueyled yt
he was becom^ in so perfyte life / After yt the freres were assembled he being in
ye mids among hem / ye holy man began to preche of ye penance and
co^uersaco^n of the said brother al ye night And in maky^g ye said sermon. like
as the brother had be a sleep / he rendered and gave up his spirit unto the holy
saints to heaven. and his body was buried / And after the service done ye holy
man returned in to deserte / and in going thither oftymes he passed ye river of
Nyle / which is a river merueylously great and deep / and yet he never entered
therein depper than to his knees. which is a thing much merueylous / Another
time the devil presented to him tresours infinyte. which he said yt they had
be lo^ging to king Pharao. and were hyd in therth / The holy man Mucyns answered
to hy^ / ye and thy money be in perdico^n perpetuel / Oftymes he entered in to
ye house of the bredern there where al ye doors were shytt and closed / and wha^
he would in a moment he made a great way. And as saint copret recou^ted of ye
holy men tofore said. one of ye felyshyp of saint Iherom slepte / and might not
believe this yt the holy man said / and in slepyng he saw a book full of
lettres of gold. which ye holy fader held. In which was wrote all ye he
said / With yt he saw a man full of great lit which said to hy^ / Why herest you
not and take head of yt which the holy fader sayth^ Why slepest you / Anon
he a woke and expowned in latin to his fellows / that which he had seen /
After this came a labourer holdyng a vessel full of earth. and a waited yt the
holy man should speak to hy^ / That seeng saint Iherom and his fellows. prayed
hy^ yt he would say to hem what signefied ye vessel full of earth The holy man
answered / yt it was not necessary then^e to hem for to know it / dowtyng hy^ to
fall in to yt syn^e of vaynglory if he told to hem ye sygnyficaco^n / yt which
nevertheless he declared to hem by cause they were come to hy^ fro so far a
country in saying thus. Sith that we other faders become in to ye land of
Egypt. the land has be fertyle and full of goods. and tofore al yt was sown
the worms ete it / For ye laborers were paynyms and infydeles. yt which ben
by us converted to ye faith / and come to bring every year of therth. to
the end yt we should bless it. and after they meddle it with their seeds. and
say to them in blessy^ge it^ Goo forth. be it to ye like as you byleuest in god
/ He recou^ted also a thing more merueylous by hy^ done to thexaltaco^n of the
name of god. like as it folowyth / Also as he descended in to ye cite nigh to
his hermitage. he fond in the said cite a Manychien^ a deceyuour of the people.
with whom he dysputed of ye faith. But by cause ye said manychien was cautelous
and subtle in words. to ye end yt the herers should not be skau^dred in the
christian faith / The holy man said. all ye make a fire in the myddyl of the
place / in which we shall put us tweyne And I believe that he shall be brent
that has the worste faith and law / so it was made. And incontinent the holy
man took ye manychyen by ye hand to lead him with hy^ / the which answerde yt
he should come after / And that it was reason sith he had do make ye fire. yt
he should go before / Then^ ye holy man in the name of god divided ye flam^e.
in which he entered in. and abode there the space of half an hour without
taking of any harm / and that seeng they that were assystent began to say /
O lord god how much merueylous works and things do you in thy saints /
Then^e they co^streyned the said many chyententree in to ye fire / but he always
reculed and drew abacke / Fynably they put him therein. and inco^tynent he
began to brene / Yet yt notwithsto^dyng he was draw out again / and after
driven out of the cite shamfully. in cryenge that the deceynour should be brent
all quycke / A another time he passed by a temple whereas the paynym^s sacrifyed
their god / and he said to them / Wherefore sacrefye ye to things infused /
how well truth it is yt ye ben more worthy than your god dis. for ye be or
may be reasonable / And thus saying god enspired them and cam^ after him in to
desert. and byleued in god There was a paynym which robbed cule wortes nigh to
thermytage of ye holy man. and bare hem away to boylle in his house / But when
he had boyllyd hem in hours. there were also grieve as they were when he gadred
hem / Then^ he cam^ and cried mercy to the bredern. and so he was converted to
the faith / Wherefore how evil o^ synful one be: he out not therefore to have
despayr of his helth^ for if he retorn^ to god. he shall receive him to
penance. like as he did the holy man Mucyns /

Of saint Cyr. Ysaye. and Paul. which begyn^yth Adhebat adhuc / Caplm x.


THe holy saints. Cyr. Ysaye / and Paul were of life much solytary and
relygious. As they iii. togrder went in a viage for to vysite one of her
bredern / Wha^ they had gone iii. days Journey nigh to ye monastery where he was
they were co^streyned to pass a river. on which was no bote to pass with.
then^ they said let us pray together to god. yt he woll give us grace to pass
this flode. to the end yt we may achyue our vyage. and there prayer made god sent
to hem a boat. And they made asmoche way in an hour as they had do in iii.
days / and wha^ they were aryued alo^de / Ysaye said. god has showed me ye
man which we go to see. he comyth to mete us. For he knows our comy^g. Also
paul said god has showed me yt after iii. days he shall pass out of this
world in to that other / In saying these words and in walkyng for to goo to
the monastery. where as they hoped to find their brother. they encou^tred and
met him and salewed hem saying / Blessed be god that this day has showed to
me in spirit that. which I see with mine eyes And then^e he showed to them al
their cogytaco^ns and the merytes yt they had anenst god / Anon saint Poul
thus said God has reveled to us yt within three days thou shall deye / and
therefore declare to us by what virtue thou have be agreeable to our lord. to
the end that thou which art ready to goo to him. leave to thy successors some
rule and manner. by yt which they may have merit in their operaco^ns Then^e
the holy man answered in this manner. I did never thing of great merit / But
I have called always the name of god in my trybulacions / and the grace of god
never left me / for I had never necessyte / All yt I would ete changels have
brought to me. and also I have had by the bou^te of our lord reuelaco^n of many
things which have be done in the world / The light of my soul was never
quenched. I have seen thangels assystau^t with god many times / Also the
reward of the meries of relygious people. and generally of al ye heavenly court.
I have seen also the devil and his co^plyces put in fire perdurable. and the
rightful men in to glory eternal / And after wha^ he had by ye space of iii.
days comforted them. he rendered and gaaf up his spyrite to god / And forthwyth
they saw the angels which bare his soul in to heaven /

Of saint Helayn which begyn^yth in latin / Fuit et alius vix / Caplm xi



Saint Helain syn the time of his yongth was instruct in ye service divine in
all chastity and contyne^ce. And in the time yt he was a child. when ye fire
was failed in ye church. Incontinent he went in to the next house. and brought
fire in his robe without bren^yng of it. The which thing his bredern seeing
were greatly amerueyled in desiring the perfecco^n of his life / On a time he
being in desert had desire to ete any And anon after he saw some on a stone /
But he considred yt it was by ye fallace of ye deuyll^ and ete no thing thereof
/ but said to hy^self / O dangerous co^cupiscence^ go far fro me. for it is
written yt we should walk in good hope and spirite^ and put fro us fleshly
desires / After this he left yt place. and went ferder into desert. where as he
did many sastynges. and a terhe fo^de an hepe of aples in ye way. but he ete
none. For he knew the devil had laid them there. and said to himself It is
wrytt. that a man not only lyuyth by mete. but also by the word of our
savior / And after yt he had^ fasted yet a another weke. an angel apperyd to
hy^ in saying / Ete that which thou shall find. after yt thou shall be
awaked. and trow no thing that this is by the deuyls craft / And when he
aroos he saw a fountain clear and herbs by. whereof he ete. and after he
drank of ye fountain / Those herbs him thought and semyd of so great
swetnes. that never had be eten beter mete ne more sweet / In that place he
fo^de a cave. in which he abode a certain time / And all yt he demanded of
god he had On a time he went for to vysite his brethern. and for to help them
in their necessytee He bare to them somoche mete / that he bare so heavy that
he might vnethe go And as god would he saw wild asses. passing by the deserte
/ To whom he made an exclamaco^n saying. I command you wyld asses in ye name
of Ihesu Christ and adjure you that one of you come to me and receive my burden
The which words said one of the asses came to saint Helayne offrynge himself
with all meekness and debonayrte. who anon laid his faidell upon his back
and sat upon it / And that done he bare him promptly unto thermytages of ye
bredern which he went for to vysite /

On a another day / which was on a Sunday he came in a monasterye for to
vysite the brethern being them. and in vysitynge he knew that they kept not
the solempnytee in their church or chapel as they ought to do on that day
/ Anon he inquired the cause of ye neclygence / They answerde that they hadd
no priest there / And yt he which was acustomyd to sing there was beyond a
river. which was between them and the celle wherein the pressed dwelled / To
whom none of them durst go for dread that they had of a terryble serpent named
Coquodrille. which held him abowte the said river / Then^e the holy man said
to them. If ye woll I woll goo fetch him / And incontinent he came to the
ryuage of the river. upon which he callid the name of god and anon the
serpent was by him / And he which had be acustomed to devour men. yielded
him subget and tame unto ye holy man. And bare him upon his back over the
river, and set him on the ryuage / Then the holy man departed fro him and
came to the priest for to pray him to come to the bredern / Now was the holy
man cladde with old and foul clothing. Of whom the p^^est which never had
seen him before was greatly admerueyled. And demanded of hy^ who. and frowhens
he was. and for what cause he was come thider / And after yt he knew by his
answer that he was an holy man of god. he followed him to the river / And the
priest said that there was no boot ne vessel to set them over / The holy
man answerde / be no thing in doubt ne aferde. I shall make ready to the a
good message^ / Then^e the holy man called the serpent. yt which approchynge
to him presented his back to bear him / And he mounted thereon. and after badde
the priest for to come by him. saying that he should no thing be aferde. But
he seenge the terrible be began to flee and goo a back / The other brethren
which were come thither see^ge that were merueyllously affrayed / And after
that the said be had brought him over the water again he said to him / It
is better to the cruel be to deye now presently. than to do any more
dysplaysure to the people. like as thou haste ben acustomed /

The which words said. he fell ^^wne deed / The holy man Helayn abode three
days to the said monastery and taught the brethern / And also excyted them
to ^ ^^yste and wythstonde diverse (...). of which they were defoy^^^ (...)
^spyraco^n dyuyne he (...) were replenysshyd with (...) / Some with Ire / Other
(...) ^^aryce and vain glory. And (...) other had Justice ^ humylytee (...).
And they seenge that he (...) their thoughts began to amend th^^to / After
this he forse^^ge that certain brethern should come thither said to the
brethern / Make ready some wottes for hem that shall anon come hither / And so
they did And as soon as they were come he received them honorably / And after
he returned in to deserte / A another time came to him a young man. which
prayed him to be his dyscyple / The holy man showed to him his labors which
he should do and bear. if he would be relygyous / And how with great pain
might he resyste to the temptacyons of the devil / But of asmoche as he
dyscounseyled him to leave it. somoche the more the young man was enflammed. and
encouraged / Promising to endure and suffer all in pacyence / Then^e he
delyuerde for all his richesse to him a ca^erne or a cave fast by his And
Incontinent as he was put in / ye night after came the devil / and tempted him
in foul and Infamyd cogytacyons / And with that they enforcyd them to hurt
and to slay him / This seenge the young man. returned to his fair fader
Helayn. which comforted him / and brought him to his cauerne and made about
it an hedge. in defending the deuylles. that they should not come night to his
lodging / And never after did they to him more vyolence And it is rad of him.
that he ete never but heavenly mete. and such as god sent to him On a time his
brethern came to see him / But he had nothing to give to them / And
Incontinent came a young man which brought myraculously that which was
necessary for their refecco^n / Ferdermore says saint Iherom yt saint Coprett.
of whom is written here tofore brought ye same saint Iherom / his bredern and
his fellows in to a gardyne. after yt he hadd told to them all thise dyuyne
operacions / In which gardyne he had palm trees^ apple trees. and many other
trees. yt he told them that he had planted there And said saint Coprett yt he
had do this to thensa^ple of ye laborers his neighbors. which were
acustomed to come fetch of the duste and pouldre and dry earth in the places.
where as the holy faders dwelled / and sewe / and threw abroad ye same earth
upon their land / Byleuynge fermly yt it should be thereby the more fertile and
habu^dant / He said ferdermore yt it should be great shame to the holy faders
there dwelling. if the laborers should have in them gretter faith than^e they
seeng that the same faith was in them by the holy faders confermyd /

Saint Iherom says that he and his fellows saw a another holy fader named
Helye nigh a cite named Anthinos^ which was Metropolytane in the parties of
Thebayde / and this holy fader was of ^hage of an. C. and x. year or there
about / Which in virtue and holy life semyd to be egall to Helye the prophet
/ This holy man was much solitary. for he was by the space of lxx. year in a
deserte so horrible yt it may not well be written / And there be was in
passing his life solytary in such wise. not where the people of ye world
dwelled / The way was so hard and sharp. yt they yt came thither might not
pass it / ye place where he lay was so terryble. yt no man might behold it
wtoute horror / And when it came so yt his members began to tremble for a^ge.
he used for his mete a little bread and oil olyue much sobrely But in his
yongthe he had fasted many times a^^ hoole weke without any etynge / The^ was
never man saw him goo out of his hermytage. like as other heremytes wytnessen

sickness and maladyes / and at last finysshed in glory eternal his day /

Of saint Pithiryon. which begynnyth Redeu^tes / Caplm xiii.


IN such wise as saint Iherom and his fellows returned fro the hayde they saw
a mountain / unto the which no man might goo without great diffyculte and
pain / In ye said mountain were diverse heremyte. of whom saint Pithyrion was
fader and abbot. the which had be dyscyple of saint Anthonye / And after had
dwelled with saint Amon. of whom is af^^r written / This same saint Pythiryon
was of so great virtue / as well in helpyng the seek people. as in fyghtyng and
resystynge the deuylles / Which hadd dowble the virtues of the said two faders
/ That is to wit of the said saint Anthonye. of whom we shall speak herafter.
and of ye foresaid saint Amon of whom he had be successively dyscyple Saint
Iherosme was enseyned and taught of the said saint Pythiryon how he might
resyste and eschew ye te^ptaco^ns of the devil of hell / Who some ever woll
have domynaco^n and puyssau^ce upon the deuylles. him behouyth first that he
resyste against his sins and passions / And when we shall have take a way one
vice or one sin fro our soul / ye devil that tempts a man of the said
sin. Incontinent shall depart fro the body where it has been. His life was
much strayte / For two times in a weke he ete but only / Ne drank but a
little browet made with meele. without to take any other refecco^n. in what
aege he was / But our lord which knew the Right great and synguler devotion
that he had in him and to his service. gaaf to him above nature strength and
courage to bear and sustain those right strayte and merueillous penaunces /

Of saint Eulogyon. which begynnyth in latin Vidimus et alium Caplm xiiii.


AFter this spekith saint Iherom saying / that he saw an other holy fader
named Eulogyon / The which among other graces that he had. he knew al ye
thoughts good and evil of all them that in his presence came to the altar.
for to receive their maker or creator /

So it happed on a time that some relygiouses would receive their savior /
But the holy man kept them fro it, saying to one of them these words / O
myschaunte man art thou so folysshe to come for to receive thy god. And thou
had this night will for to acomplysshe the sin of Fornycacyon / And he
said to that other / and thou haste said in thine heart. that it is no more
daungeour to admynystre himself to the table of Ihesu Christ in dedely sin.
than in the astate of grace / And that is all one. being good and evil / And
after he said to a another / Thou haste said in thyself that ye sacrament of
the awter may not Iustefye the / And then sent them again for to do
penance / Reputyng them unworthy to receive the sacrament of the awter / Here
upon ought the priests to take ensample. when they prepare and make them
ready to say mass / And also all other creatures that gone and purpoos to
receive the holy sacrament of the awter /

Of saint Appellen^ and begynnyth in latin Vidimus and aliu^ presbiteru^ /
Caplm xv.


Saint Appellen was a forgeur of ^ren / And that which was necessary to ye
bredern he forgyd it to them / On a night as he was forgynge the devil came
to him to likeness of a fair woman. and brought him work for to forge /
Then the holy man took out of his furnays a ba^^e of yren and cast it in to
her vysage

Then the devil made so terryble a cry that all the bredern were awaked /
and thereof he had such a yefte of god / that frothan forthou he might take in
his bare hand without to be burnt the yren all hot and hrennynge reed. And
when saint Iherom and his fellows came to him he received them benygnely. and
told to them of the manners and life of some of his bredern / And first of
one named John^. ye which was much old and auncyen. surmountyng ye other in
holiness of life and of good manners / And told to them that at ye beginning.
that the said John^ came in to deserte. He was three year under a toche in
oryson and prayer without lyenge on the ground The said John^ slepte not but
lenynge / And ete not but on the Sunday / On which day the priest admynystred
to him the holy sacrament of the awter. of which he lyuyd only / On a day
the devil wenynge to dysceyue him. transfigured himself to the semblaunce of
a priest / And came tofore him the hour acustomyd In faynynge to give to him
the holy sacrament of the awter / But the holy man seenge that it was the
devil said to him / O cursyd devil why cessest thou not to trowble the
devout souls / How art thou so hardy to play and Iape with the holy
sacrament of thawter / The devil answered that he supposyd to have dysceyued
him. as he hadd done a another / The which after that he had obeyed to him. he
became folysshe. and out of wit / In such wise that with pain and vnethe
many holy men might by prayers and orysons reduce him again unto his place. and
to his former health / And when the devil had said so. he vanisshed away fro
ye holy man. Of whom it is radd that by over long being in prayer. his poor
fete which were contynuelly in rest were broken and roten / And after that he
had done this penance by the space of three year. thangell apperyd to him and
said / God has received thy orysons and prayers / And sendyth to the word yt
all thy soores shall be heelyd and guarysshed / Then the angel towched him
by the mouth and by the teeth^ and Inco^tyuent he was all hoole and guarysshyd
/ of al his soores. and replenysshed with science and with all graces in such
wise. that he never after had hungre ne thirst / Thangell commanded him
after that he should goo to other places. visytynge his bredern for to comfort
them. and tenseyne and teache to them holy doctrine And on a time it happed yt
a man crokebacked came to him to the end that he might recouere health / and
would mount upon a mare for to ride thither / the which was gyrde with one
cengle which ye holy man had made / For gladly every day in the weke ^auf the
Sandaye he made cengles / and couery^ges of leaves of palm wouen after the
custom of the country / And so as ye said crokebacked was mounted on the
mare. he was forthwyth all hoole / by cause his fete had towched the said
cengle The holy man was of so great merit and virtue / that when he sent to
any seek people of the bread which he had blessed with his hand / If they ete
thereof / they were heelyd of all maladyes and sykenesses He had also this grace
that he knew all the thoughts of his bredern / And Incontinent wrote to there
faders and abbottes. how there some ruled them in sins and uncleaness / And
other prouffyted in science and virtues / Some were inpacyente and set
naught by their bredern / The other were constaunt and in charity / He preched
to us to torn our eyes fro things transytory. and to fyxe them in goods in
fallyble and eternal / Also said the holy fader. that is of necessite to a man
to have courage manly or vyrile. in leuynge the manners and condycyons of evil

Saint Iherom writith of a monastery after. where in was an holy heremyte named
Paphu^ce strongly reno^med emonge thermites of the deserts / He had dwelled in
thut terest or last deserts of Heracleos. a cite reno^med in Thebayde / of
whom saint Iherom says. That on a time he prayed god yt he would show to whom
of the saints of heaven he should be like or semblable / Thangell of god
answerde to him. yt he should be like to a player upon a symphonye, the which
by the streets sought his living in sy^gynge / Then^e he was much abashed of
thanswere. and went forth Incontyne^t for to seche him where he might find him
/ When he had fond him / he asked by of his life and of his works / And he
recounted to hy^ how he had always lived symply in co^misynge many theftes and
other sins / Paphunce yet asked him more fe^der. if in doing those theftes
he had ever done any operacyon. or work virtuous / The said man answerde that
he knew in him no good. save on a time his fellows. which were thieves as he
was hadd take by force a virgyn. which was sacred to god. and when he saw /
yt they would have defoylled her / He thrested emonge them. and preseruyd her
fro corruptynge / After this he sayde^ yt on a another time that he fond a
woman married walking within deserts. the which was all desolate. and was nigh
deed for hu^gre by cause she had not ete in three days. Then he demanded her
for what cause she went so alone in the wodes. to whom she answered. that her
husbond was prisoner and three of his children by his evil governance / And for
to eschew yt she should not be take. she so fled. and not wythstondynge
that she gaaf over herself to the said theyf. yet nevertheless he did to her
no dishonor. But gave to her.iii. C. shilinges. of which she boughte her
husbond and the three chyldern out of prison / And the theyf said yt he had done
none other good thanne this which he had said / Then the good fader Paphunce
answered / yt he himself never had done such works of charyte^ Saying to him
more over that god had showed to him that he should have asmoche Joy in heaven
as he / And therefore he cou^seyled him yt he should leave his evil life / and
convert him to do well. And Incontinent he cast away his ^oytes and his
symphonie. and turned all his art of musyke in to spyrytuell songs. In
such wise yt he was three year in thermytage with the said holy fader in
fastings and merueylous abstyne^ce / And at last rendered and gaaf his spyryte
with thangels in to heuen^ And after the said saint Paphunce put hy^self to do
more penance and gretter tha^ he did tofore / And yet again he demanded of
god / to what man in earth he was semblable. ye voys of heaven answered to him
yt he was semblable unto ye lord of a Brugh nigh to his hermytage The which
thing herd / he went Incontinent for to know of the governance of the said
lord / and came in to his house / Anon as the lord had received him benygnely
/ The holy fader demanded of him of his merytes. and virtues / The which
lord wyllyng to he ^le and hyde his bountee: answered to him humbly. that he
never had done any good deed. The holy fader suffered it well saying. that he
had reuelacyon that he was semblable and like in virtues to the holy heremytes.
dwelling in deserte / The lord knowing the Reuelaco^n made of his life.
began tex pose the manner of his living / the which was greatly to be
merueyled / First he said how well that his wit sithe the time of their
waryage was excellently fair and of young aege / Nevertheless for the great
loanges that he hadd other time recyted of the louable virtue of chastyte / He
had to the same desired and persuaded her thereto sith and after that she hadd
hadd by him three children / That by the space of xxx. yere^ during the which
they had contynuelly ben playsauntly in marriage that one with that other / Yet
had they never towched flesshely that one with the other / But at such time as
they were prycked and desired tacomplysshe their flesshly delectaco^ns / they
have myghtly wythstode and resysted them during the time aforsayd / as they
yet done / Secondly he said that all his life he had not cessed to lodge
pylgryms And that he himself went first to receive them in / He had never
despised the poor people. but had benygnly mynystred to them their necessytees
/ In doing Justice he spared no more his children than the estrangers / The
gods of other he never retained / If any dyscorde hadd be moeuyd emonge his
men / he never cessed till he hadd made them acorded / Never man found his
servants doing any evil to other. and his beestes had never done any
do^mage to the graynes or corn of his neygboure Who some ever would sow any
corn on his lord. he would never for bydde it him. ne also to gadre and take
ye prouffyte / And more over he would never suffer the rich to offend ne
hurt ne grieve the poor / But had always studied to do playsure to other / And
also of all them that had pleeted tofore him. he never condemned one / but
had constreyned them tacorde theymself / And this seenge the fader heremyte
bowynge his heed / gaaf to him his blessing / The blessing of god of Syon be
give and granted to the. to the end that thou may eternally see the goods
of Iherusalem all thy life /

And for asmoche said saint Paphu^ce that thou haste acomplysshed thy days in
virtues works and good manners / There abides one thing. which is necessary
/ That is that ye leave all thy mouable goods and herytages / And renounce
them in following thy lord and Instructour Ihesu christ / And incontinent
without to dyspose his gods the said lord with the said holy fader went so
far. yt they came to a river where never any person had passed without boot
/ The holy fader constreyned him to enter therein / And notwythstondynge the
water was much deep. Nevertheless they passed it lightly. without to entree
more deep than their sides / After they went so long yt they came to the
deserte / Where saint Paphunce delyuerd to him a little celle and a little house
nyghe unto his monasterye / In exposynge to him the Rules of holy conuersacyon
and the excersyte of perfyghtnesse / And after that he duly and suffysauntly

himself to lead a more straytter life than he had done before / And also to do
and make greter abstynences / And ye pain that he had to for suffered and the
penance that he had borne and suffred^ he reputed over little. Seeng yt they
that were in ye world did things of so great virtue / Like as did they two
aforsayd / After that the lord of whom is tofore spoken had lived the space of
long time in ye hermytage. in augmentynge and multeplyenge his perfeccyon /
The said Paphunce being there in his celle or lytill house saw the soul of
the said lord borne by angels in to heaven saying / Blessed is he whom thou
have chosen / For he shall dwell with the / And by that knew the holy fader.
that the said lord was sauyd / Wherefore the said holy fader constreyned
himself to do yet more great abstinences than he did tofore / And in like
wise prayed he yet god again that he would show to him to whom he was
semblable among the men / To which request a voys answerde / Thou shall be
semblable to a merchant which anon shall come hyder for to vysite the /
Wherefore arise and goo to mete him / Anon the holy fader aroos and went down
for to mete the said merchant. yt which came fro Alexandrye. and brought fro
Theybayde many marchaundyses the which he had in three ships which was worth
of their money.iii. thou sand shyllynges or there abowte. And by cause he was
a good man: and louyd well relygyon^ be brought to the said holy fader ten
sackes full of pesen and benes for to make with potage / And when Paphunce saw
him. he said to him / What do thou man of god /

What life ledest thou in earth. or what consolaco^n have thou with them that been celestyall / Leave unto erthly and worldly people the goods of the world.
And do somoche that thou be marchaunte and solicytour of the reame of heaven.

thing so happed / For the merchant following the good admonycyons of saint
Paphunce made to be give and dealed his goods to poor men / servants of god

world / in to the glory of heaven / And in like wise after deyed ye holy fader
Paphunce / But yet the angel showed to him his death saying / Come thou holy
man blessed of god Loo here the prophets which hen with me for to receive the.
The which grace I have not showed to the before / to the end that thou
sholdest not be proud / The holy man lived one day after. and recounted this

after he gave to them many techinges / Among all other he showed to them /
yt they should never despise other. of what estate or what vocacion he was.
though he were vycyous / For in every ord^e of man's life. there ben two
souls pley saunt to god. by doing some things secretly and unknown / And
thus may be concluded / that the habyte makyth not the man pleysaunt ne
agreeable to god / but oonly the clennesse of life After that the said holy
fader Papounce hadd give to his brethern enseygnements and many other techynges
And that he had take leave of them in great humylyte / he rendered his soul to

assystences. In syngyng songs and dyctees celestyall /

IN Thebayde was a monastery and covent of saint Ysodote. playsaunte and greatly
reno^med / The relygyouses that were there within had much great and large
howses / There were many pondes. gardynes. and trees berynge fruit / With this
there were all things necessary for the bodyly life. In such wise that they
hadd no need to goo out for to such their necessytees to live / Tofore the
gate of the said Monasterye was an old man much prudente / the which said
to all them that would en tree / That if they would entree ones in they should
never come out / And that such was the law / Now there was one thing therein
much merueyllous / For Incontinent as one was entered. ye said law took none
effect / By cause of his propre will without constraynt he was content to
abide there / In such wise that he was rauysshed in contemplynge his
perfeccyon and holiness that was within the said monastery / And that same old
man that kept the gate hadd a little house^ in which he receyuyd all them
that came thither. And treated manerly and well.

Ferthermore says saint Iherom yt when he arrived there. he might not enter
therein. But inquired of the Portyer the manner of living in the said
monasterye / The which said to him and to his felyshipp / That there with in
were two auncyente and old men Which oonly hadd power to goo out and entree
in again / The which were Pourueyours. for to pourueye for the poor life of
the bredern that were within / Which always weren in scylence. making their
prayers. and occupyenge all their life time in virtuous ocupacyons to serve
god / Yet was there more merueylles / For never was there any of the
Relygiouses that were seek there within / But when they should deye they showed
their death that one to that other in the presence of their fellows / And
rendered their spyryte Ioyously to god /

Saint Iherom saw in the regyon A^senoitte a another deuowte Relygyous man.
named Serapyon^ Abbot and fader of many monasteryes / In which were nyghe
by.x. Mill Relygyouses and heremytes living of their propre labors / And of
that which they wanne in the season when they gadred the corn and grayne^ /
And they gave to the said Abbot the most part of their gain. by which they
were nourysshed. and sustained the poor people / The custotome was such. not
oonly in that Relygyon. but also in all Egypt. for to hyre the said Heremytes
and relygyouses in the time of Harvest / And each of them wanne abowte a four
score mewes or combs of grain. after the mesure of the said country of
Egypt Some more and other less. after that the seeson was more habundaunt.
plenteuous or sharpness and scarsytee / And of the same the most part was
give to poor people after the ordinance and dyscreco^n of them that were
ordained to make dystrybuco^n of the same corn and grain / Their charytee was
so great. that they gaaf not oonly to ye pore of the same countreye. but they
sent ships full charged and lade in to Alexandrye for to give to prisoners
and nedy of the countreye. For in Egypt were not poor people enough for to
give in alms the said corn and graynes.

Saint Iherom saw also in the cytees of Mempheos and Babylone a multitude
Innumerable of heremytes. the which were all full of virtues and graces to god
agreeable / In that country it is said that ye places is. where as Joseph made
his grenyres for ye famyne / And therefore that place is called ye place of the
tresours of Joseph / Other call it Pyramidas. by cause they had such credence
that such where should be there assembled by Joseph in that manner.

Recounted and told to saint Iherom and his fellows. that emonge the said
heremytes and relygiouses there was one named Apolonyon / Which for his right
honest life was ordained in the order of Deaken / In which estate he was
strongly persecuted / And during the said persecuco^n. the said Apolonyon
admonested always his bredern to receive martyyrdom Anon after he was take and
put in prison / And he being therein. came to him the persecutours. which were
Paynyms / Which in mocking hy^ did to him many Iniuryes / And specially one
named Phylemon. which was much amyable and debonayr to ye people. and called
hy^self seductour and deceyour of the people / And said more over ye he was
worthy to be in the hate of al ye world / When saint Apolonyon hadd herd all this. he answered much curteisly and said / Alas my friend. I pray to god our
maker. that he have mercy and pite on the / And that he not Impute to the
thyniuryes and shames that you do to me presently / The which answer herd by
Phylemon. he was heavy and sorrowful in his heart / And moved with such
contryco^n and conpu^pcion. that Incontinent he declared himself christian / And
with as ardaunte desire enfla^med of great charity came to ye Judge. to whom
tofore all the people he began to cry / O wyked Judge thou trayueyllest Iniustly
the poor servants of god that been christian. For they ne do ne say any evil
/ The Judge herynge thise words hadd supposed at first that he had proposed
such words in Iape / But after by cause he saw him persevere in the same /
he said that suddenly he was bycome a fool / Phylemon answerde / Herke and take heed Judge I am no fool. but you art enraged and out of thy wit when
without reason. and vnryghtfully haste putt to death the good and true Christian
people / Know thou that now I hold and shall hold the christian law. the which
is necessary to all men living in this world. Then^e the Judge supposed to
have repelyd him by fair words. But by cause he saw him constaunt / he
menacyd him with Infynyte torments / The Judge also moeuyd with wrath against
the holy fader Apolonyon / Knowing that it was by his exortacyon. that the
said Phylemon had renou^ced his law. made him to suffer mani torments. and
called hy^ deceyuer and begyler / saint apolonion said to hy^. ha Judge know
thou thy maker. Certainly I desire that thou and all the assystents should keep
the error that I keep and hold / That is to say that they were christian / And
Incontinent that said the Judge commanded that they should both two be putt in
to a fire tofore all the people / And so doing they two together began to pray
god so hye that every man might here in saying / O sovereign god Ihesu
christ our protector suffer not the souls to be lost that confess the openly
/ But show to us euydently our health / And Incontinent these words sayd^
descended a cloud full of water. the which quenchyd all the fire / Of which
the Judge and the people were merueylously abashed. and began to cry in saying
/ O god of Christian men. now we confess that thou art almighty and oonly
Inmortall / Anon after cam^ these tidings to the great Prouoste of Alexandrye
/ the which as enraged sent for to fetch the said Judge and the two holy
faders / That is to wit Apolonyon and Phylemon. ordenynge that they should be
brought straytly bound like prisoners / But in ledyng them the holy man
converted them that were come to lead them / Which all they together
presented themself as christian to the said Provost of Alexandrye / Then the
cursed provost seenge that he might not revoke them fro the christian faith. he
made them all to be thrown in to the sea / And in that wise they were
baptized in ye water / Anon after the sea brought them to the ryuage all
hoole and without corrupcco^n of their bodies / Then were they buried al
togider in one sepulture And god shewyth there every day many diverse miracles
on them that serve and require them /

Of saint Dioscore abbot begin^yng Vidimus and aliu^ / Caplm xx.


AFter spekith saint Iherom of saint Dyoscore. which hadd in his monastery
night unto Thebayde.i. C. religyouses or there abowte. To whom he commanded
expressly that they should never receive their maker. if they had any sins in
their conscyences / Not only sins actuell: or in thought. but also of them
that sometime hap by dremynges. of which they fall in polluco^ns nocturnall
/ were it by fantasies or by operaco^ns of wym^en or by habu^da^ce of humors
naturell / And he said if sometime such polluco^n came without to have any
fa^tasye of any woman in ye manner / yt is no sin. But that he take therein
no playsaunce after the said dreme / For that pollucyon comyth by cause of
thabu^dance of thumour which is within the body of the man. For to eschew
such pollucyon is necessary fasting and to live sobrely / He gaaf to his
dyscyples a symylytude such / When a man is seek. And the Fylicyen defendyth
to him any mete / he kepyth his commandment / Then the relygiouses and all
manner of people that will live virtuously ought to keep them to do thing that
is contrary to the medicyne of the soul / That is to say that he must keep
him fro sin: the which makyth the soul seek / And in the end makyth it to
deye. And to the contrary if we keep it clean without dedely sin. we shall
have Joy perdurable /

Of ye monasteries of Nitrye. and begy^nyth in latin Venimus / Caplm xxi.


AFter saint Iherom and his fellows cam^ in to Nytrye. a place the most fair
and most reno^med of Egypt. dystaunt fro Alysaundrie xl. mile or there about.
which ben escryued to xxx. leukes of France / There was a cite named Nytrye
taking his name of the said region. in which growyth the Nytre. like or
semblable to sonde / Whereof ben wasshen there the clothes / And otherwise it is
called an esspyce of salt after Papye / and it is made of water and of therthe
in Egypt / And in Palestine it is made of great hete of the son / In ye
country were about.v.C. monasteryes the one nyghe unto that other under one
abbot / Of whom there some lived and dwelled together. other held them
solytarily each by himself that notwithsto^dyng they had always charity
together / And when saint Iherom and his company approached to them All in a
great company. like to a multitude of bees came against them bringing bread
and botelles full of water.

And after they brought them all singynge in to the church / After washed
their fete and wiped them with to waylles / And they were not only served of
bodyly necessytees / But also they were Instruct in humylytee and clemence /
And saint Iherom says that he never hadd be in place where he had seen flow
so habundantly charity and mercy. Their Oratoryes were full of books in
science dyuyne / And they vsyd none other things in all their days /

Of a another place called Cecylya and begynnyth in latin Post hunc vero / Caplm
xxii.
THere was a another place toward that deserte dystaunte fro yt place tofore
said x. mile or there abowte / the which was called Cecylia for the multitude
of celles and little houses that were there / The custom of the relygiouses
that there dwelled was such. yt they spoke not the one to ye other but the
saterdaye and sunday And if that one came not on that day Incontinent they
thoute that he was seek / Werfore that one after that other went for to see
him / And brought to him some thing for to sustain and help him to his
bodyly health / They never spoke together but the days tofore said. but if it
were in prechynge. or in gyuynge doctrine / When any of them was gretter
Clerk or Inspyred more than^e a another / And if any would goo dwell with any
of them / they were so replenysshed with charytee. yt they lodged them
Incontinent in their howses or cotages /



Of saint Am^onion abbot. begyn^ynge Vidimus quenda^ / Caplm xxiii.
Among the same heremytes and relygyouses saint Iherom saw one named
Am^onyon. to whom god had given all plenytude of graces / and pryncypally he
had merueyls us charity. humylite none like. and generally asmoche in pacyence.
clemence and benygnyte / Also in science and prudence he was most perfect of
them al / The said Am^onyon had ii^ bredern. yt one named Eusebius and ye
other Eu^imius / yt which were not oonly bredern carnalle. but also in life. in
religyon and in virtues they were germayns / Thise iii. bredern solycyted in
their time the other bredern as the mother thynkyth on her chyldern in helpyng
them not only to their corporal life. but also to the spirituell. as
enscynynge them to virtues and good manners / The same saint Am^onion dwelled
in a monastery closyd with walls In which he himself had made a pytt And it
happed yt a brother transported himself toward him for to have a little house to
dwell in thermytage / The which answerde to him that he hadd none. but he made
him to dwell in his monastery. unto the time he had found one / Sone after he
delyuerde to him a little one. the which he fond nigh ye said monastery / And
if by adventure had many come. he had Inco^tynent gadred togider his bredern.
and in little time had made a monastery /

Of saint Dydyme why the begynnyth in latin Vidimus inter cos Caplm xxiiii.
Saint Iherom recounteth of a another named Didyme. ye which was emonge the
faders named much virtuous and debonayr / like as his vysage showed well /
And such grace had he of god. that he roode upon the scorpyons and other
venymous bestes. which were there in great habu^dance / By cause of the great
heete of ye son / And slew them with his fete as little worms of the
earth. without that they did to him any harm / Wherefor in him was
aco^plysshed the word of the prophet saying / Thou shall make thy Iourneye
upon aspydes and basylyks / And under the foot thou shalt putt the lion and
the dragon /

Of saint Crenyon which begynnyth in latin Vidimus / Caplm xxv.
A Another also which was named Crenyon of much au^cyente aege. as of an.C.
and x. year old / And was dyscyple of saint Anthonye / The which among all
other virtues that he had. he was humble pe^f^ghtly / The which virtue
suffysed to get the reame of heaven / And without this virtue none other virtue
may prouffyte to ye soul / For by that all other virtues ben required /

Of saint Orygene. beginning in latin Erat autem / Caplm xxvi.
ALso there was a another called Orygene Dyscyple of saint Anthonye merueyllous
in all operaco^ns / His word was edyfycatyff that they whom he endoctryned put
in effect by operaco^ns all his doctrine /

Of saint Enagrion. which begynnyth in latin Vidimus ibi / and cetera Caplm
xxvii.
AFter he saw also in the same place a another named Enagrion. a man right wise
/ the which was Instruct of saint Machairy / Which was strongely possessed
with all virtues / And above all thing he Instructed his brethern to live
sobrely Saying if they would eschew the fantasyes and Illusions of the devil.
that they should not drink so much water as they well might drink /
Because that great repleccyon of water causyth diverse fantasyes in man's body
/ By the moyen whereof the devil with sin enters more lightly / Inenfecte
the said holy hermyte Enagryon and his brethern ete not for all metes but oonly
a little bread and salt / Whereof they were more content than we ben of metes.
delycyous and curyouse /

Of saint Machayre Egypcyen / beginning in latin Narrabant autem / Caplm
xxviii.
AFter saint Iherom Recountyth that sum of the Ancient faders Recyted to him
among their other brethern. there were tweyne named Machayre that one Egipcyen
and dyscyple of saint Anthonye and that other of Alexandrye / and
notwythsto^dyng ye they were of diverse regyons yet were they egall in virtues.
and so great yt they shone in edify caco^n of manners and of good life like unto
ii. shynynge steires. How well ye Machary Egypcyen had by synguler grace the
virtuous manners of saint Anthonye. He being on a time in his cell or lytyl
house was perpetred and co^mysed a murdre by some homycides / by reason whereof
he was acused and pursued a simple man Innocent of the caas The which seeng be
might none otherwise escape went for refuge to the said Machaire. affermyng by
his oath not to be culpable of ye caas Then^e they that pursued cam^ upon hy^
and would have take hy^ there and have ladd him for to have conde^pned him to
death / This seeng the holy man prayed and required them yt or they proceeded
any ferder against him which said hy^self to be Innocent. would led him to ye
place where as ye man yt was slayd was buried / He being com^ thither made his
prayer upon the buryel / in prayers god devoutly yt it would pleyse him to show
and manifest the troth of this thing / His prayer made he commanded the deed
man in the virtue of ye passion of our blessid savior Ihu^ christ. ye he should
declare if he that was accused which there was hold and take had slain him
or none To whom he ye was deed answerde ye he had not done it / ne therein was
gylty Thacusers heryng this answer were much merueyled. and kneled on there
knees to for the holy fader Machairy. in prayeng him humbly ye he should
demand of the deed man who had slain hy / ye holy man answered ye he would not
in ^ayeng thise words. It suffy^eth to me yt thynnocent be delyuerd. For it
longyth no thing to me yt the culpable be acused / A another time came to hy
some parents or friends of a young damoysell. the which b^arte magyk was
converted in to a Iument or a mare. as it semyd to all them ye law her /
Inco^tynent as he law them / he demanded for what cause they were come to
him Then^e they auswerde yt by their comy^ge to him. they hoped yt by the moyen
of his prayers and merytes to obtain ye said damoysel to be remysed in her
first strength and semblau^ce / Then^e he excyted them to pray. and also he
made his oryson unto god. yt which oryson acheued he enoynted the maid /
which as said is was like a mare / The which incontinent after ape^^d to the
men in her first form. yt is to wit in the se^blau^ce of a maid / A another
maid which had the me^bres so rotes and infect ye worms might be seen cryng
he flesh unto ye bones. was brout tofore this holy man^ to whom he said / O
daughter be constau^t. for god has not ye^e to the this sykenesse for to deye.
but for thy health / Then was the holy man Machaire vii. days during in
prayers. and enoyntyng her every day And the said.vii. days passed she was
all hoole and sou^de / Of the same wrytyth saint saint Iherom. that an Heretyke
Ierasitain / which is to say in langage Egypcyen heresees by his art had
deceived and mocked many bredern of the deserte / And at last he came to the
holy fader Machaire / to whom he made many questyons and arguments / For he
supposyd to have turned and deceived him / The holy man by fair words
answerde to his arguments which were subtle / But by cause ye the holy fader
saw. that by him the faith of the bredern perysshed / he said to the same
Heretyke / Wherefore dysputest thou thus against me. for to torn by thy heresye
them that herkene the / Let us goo to the sepuleres of our predecessors
which ben deed / To the end that to him which our lord shall give grace for to
reyse ye deed may by this thing make clear appear to all them that shall be
present that his law is the best / Then they went to the sepulcres Then
said saint Machaire. now call a deed man. and reyse him / The Heretyke answered
yt it apperteyned to him first for to call to his god / Then saint Machaire
fell platte down in prayer saying / O my souereyn lord and god I byseche
and require the mekely that it playse the in this hour in the Reysyuge of this
deed man here buried to show openly the which of us tweyne has most
rightful faith. Not that I presume so much of myself / that my oryson or
prayer be of the enhau^ced / But for to encreace and make open the holy law /
And also for to conferme thoos that been here present / And to bring them
out of the heresye of this Heretyke Incontinent these words said. He called
the deed man by the name that he hadd in his life / The which anon answered
and rose / And after that the brethern vnwounde his covering. He showed him
all living to thoos that were there present / The Heretyke this seenge was
much admerueyled / And fled a way for dread of all the bredern / Which
chaced him out of the countreye / Therefore ought no man dyspute the faith
against the Heretykes. but if he be Inspyred and taught of god / By the help
of whom he may by miracles more than by reasons verytably preue that which he
woll mayntene /

Of the virtues of that other saint Machayre of Alexandrye / And begynnyth in
latin Alius vero sa^ctus. etc^ Caplm.xxix.


Saint Machaire of Alexa^drye souerayn and more than all the other louyd
solytude. He inquired curiously of the most far hermitages. till yt he was
at ye ferthest place of all the deserte / Where he fond al plentenousnes and
habu^dance of diverse fruytes and all other good things / There were.ii.
bredern. to whom he prayed yt they should bryge of the other hermytes thither by
cause the place was much fertyle and habu^dant / The same bredern dreding /
and not without cause them ye they should bring to be deceived with
te^ptacions of the devil. by cause yt in the same deserte there were many
deuylles. and horrible monstres / And answerde to him yt they might not be
brought thither / but that they should be in dangeour to be begyled and deceived
in coming / Then^e the holy fader returned to his bredern / To whom he showed
these things. which he had seen / And by this cause they were moeuyd for to
goo with him for to see that same deserte^ The aeged and ailcyent men
considering ye dau^geours of the said temptaco^ns. cou^seyled ye young men yt
they should not goo thither For the place after their oppynyon might more be
cause to deceive hem tha^ to moeue them to deuoco^n. And more over the holy
fader said to them that ye places is full of delyces. and if we vsyd them /
What hope ought we to have of the other world / When we in this world shall
live at our playsure / The young bredern herynge thise words and fair
remonstrau^ces. anon concluded not for to goo thither / The place then^e wherein
as dwelled the holy fader Machair was called Sycheon. to which place was
another way ne path / And was as far from ye monasteryes of Nytrye about.ii^
Iourneyes / They had but little water. and yet it was noyous and bitter to
dry^ke / On a time was presented to him a clustre of grapes / the which
Incontinent by charity he sent to one of his bredern which was seek. and he
gave it to a another. And yt man gaaf it a another. and he to a another / And fro
hond to hand it was so often yeuen. ye fynably it came again to him fro whom
it first was departed / And saint Machair knowy^ge their great love yt they
had together. and for to conferme our faith saint Iherom rehercith of the said
saint Machaire. ye he herd say of ye mouth of ye said saint Machaire / yt
the devil came to hy^ on a night saying / Machair arise you. and go we where as
ye bredern ben assembled in prayer / and inco^tynent by the grace of god he
knew yt it was the ^^yll. and answered to him / O liar en^^e of troth. answer
to me presently ^^at haste you to do with ye congrega^^ of ye holy bredern /
The devil answe^ to hy^ / Know you not well yt thasse^ (...) of relygyous
people ne their deeds (...) never made. but yt we deuylles ben ^^ed thereto.
come and you shall see our de^^ / Then^e saint Machaire put hy^ to ^^yer / in
prayenge god yt he would lete^^n know if his word were true. and in ^^ynent he
saw like lytyl black chyl^^ goo and flee by all ye parties of ye chir^^ / Now
was ye custom there such. yt (...) alone said the psalms. and the other ^^d^
or they answered / He saw then^e ye ^^^e chyldern black as ethyopiens. whi^^^
deceyned and mocked all the bredern. In ^he wise when they towched some bi^yen.
anon they were a sleep. And if ^^^y towched them on the mouth they ^^yd to
sy^ge Tofor some they showed ^^^m in lyknes of a woman / and in ef^^^ by diverse
scorns many bredern were ^^^eyued. in such wise yt some might ^^t abide in
ye church / To other bredern ^^y sprange upon their sholds. by can they had
none affecco^n ne thy^ king (...) their prayers / and this seeng saint
ma^aire. made his prayer to god. saying ^^y god arise you and chase a way ye
fen^^s. to the end yt they appyere not tofore (...) face / ne tofore my bredern.
for our sou^^ ben all full of their socrnes. like as ^^w I apperceyue / His
orison made. he ^^lled ye one after yt other all the bredern / ^^fore whom he
had seen ye deuylles / and ^^ed them if in making their orrsons ^^^i had been in
will to do any works ^^orell. like as ye holy man had seen / ^^ey ansuerde ye
/ Then^e the holy man knew that the vayn thoughts yt they had. came of the
scorny^ges of ye devil. And to this purpoos says saint Iherom. yt when the
thought of ye man is well set in ye love of god. it never takith any fantasye
which is grievous to him or cause of syn^e / A another thing more merueylouus
of ye said saint Machaire says saint Iherom / That is to wit. yt when any of
his bredern came to receive ye holy sacrament of thawter / If they were not
clean in their co^scyences it semyd to ye said holy fader / yt the body of our
lord returned to thawter. But when ye good men came for to receive their
savior. ye deuyllis inco^tynent returned bacwarde and far On a another time
ye same saint Machayire. and that other Machaire his brother. of whom is to fore
spoken. put them in a boot for to go vysite one of their bredern. and with
them were some noble officers / called trybunes right puyssaunt and rich /
having with them many chyldern. great no^bre of horses and Innumerable qua^tyte
of silver with other good / When one of them saw them in ye bote cladde with
pore clo^hes. he said to them / Alas bredern yt ye ben happy / which thus
despise the world. and in it so despysyng were so vile and poor clothes /
Verily it apperyth yt ye mock yourself of them of ye world Then^e the one
ansuerde to hy^. truly you say well. for they yt follow god by virtues mock
theymself / But ye contrary we have pity of you. by cause yt the world
deceyuynge you mock you / Then^e he yt had aresoned them when he was returned
in to his house gaaf for goddis love all ye he had / And after became hy^self
religious with the holy heremytes /

Of saint Amon first relgious in Nytrie. which begynynnth in latin Iniciu^
sancti / Caplm.xxx.


THe first Heremyte in Nytrye was called Amon. the soul of whom Inco^tynent
after his death was seen by saint Anthonye borne by angels in to heaven / But
for to write of his right holy life we shall begin at his natyuyte He was of
noble and rich friends. the which against his will did hy^ to be married to a
noble woman of the country of Nytrye. He being laid a bed with her the
first night of their espoussaylles. he made to her many fair exortaco^ns. in
ercytynge her to the noble virtue of chastyte and of vyrgynyte under such or
like words / My love by cause ye without fawte thing corrupt shall find
corrupco^n / And by the contrary. thing not corrupt ought to hope
incorrupco^n / Therefore it is more auaylable to us tweyne together hoole to
dwell and entier without flesshly touching us. than ye one were corrupt of
ye other / Thise words herd by ye dyrgyne / she consented thereto lightly. and
lived together in honest chastyte and virgynyte long time after ye death of
their friends. And after ye holy man went in to ye next deserte to his
dwelling. and assembled many Heremytes / And ye said virgyne abode in her
house. accompanied with many virgyns / After yt he had be a certain time
solytarily in the deserte Some men brought to him a child enchayned / The
which had be byten with a wood hand besechyng him to pray for ye health of ye
said child / The holy man ansuerde yt he had not deserved somoche anenst god.
that should enhau^ce his prayers / But nevertheless he said to them yt the
health of the said child was in their hodes / For whan^e they would render to
a poor wydowe an ox which they had robbed fro her. their child should have
health and shall be al hoole / Of which words they were much abashed.
merueylynge by what manner ye holy man might know ye theft yt they had done
so secretly / Then^e they went home and rendered to ye widow the ore yt they
had stolen / and by the prayer of the holy man ye child was made hole again and
had his health / A another time came some other to him / of whom he would prove
the courages /

He said to them that he had great necessyte of a tonne full of water / for to
give drink to hem yt disyted hy^ / And prayed and required them that they
would bring to him a tonne full / which they promised for to do and to
fulfylle / And after that they were departed fro him. ye one said to his fellow
ye haste promised the water as well as I Wherefore you shall do it be borne to
hy^. if you wolt yt it be borne / For I have not but my camel. yt which shall
never bear it / That other answerde. you knoweste well ye I ne have but an ass /
the which may not bear so much as thy camel may / For ye one is more
stronger than the other / To whom that other answered / Do what you wolt. for I
woll not slay my camel / Then^e ye other said / and I shall lay it on mine
ass yt which you dare not lay on thy camel / But I hope yt the merit of
the holy man shall make possible. yt which is impossyble to a creature / The
ass anon after ye he was charged with the tonne full of water. bare it to the
lodgis of the holy man Amon. also lightly as he had borne no thing on him /
And then^e the said saint Amon in receyuyng the said water. said to the good
man which was come thither for to guide his be Thou haste done well for to
bring ye tonne upon thyn ass. for the camel of thy fellow is deed / And wha^
that other was returned he fond. that it was true The said Amon was somoche
bilouyd of god. that he gate of hy^ singular graces / and among the other when he
would pass and go over the river of Nyle. because he was shamfaste to unclothe
hy^self suddenly he fond himself set over the river on that other side of the
ryuage / Therefore we ought faithfully to believe / that to Just and good men
is no thing impossyble /

Of saint Pyamon. which begynnyth in latin Non aute^ michi. etc. Caplm.xxxi.


Saint Iherom recou^tyth in procedy^ge ferder in this work. that this is not a
thing worthy neresonable yt any should eschew or leave to write the faytes and
deeds of the holy faders dwelly^ge in deserte nigh ye see Parthenie. nigh to a
castle named Dyolcho which among the holy faders he saw an holy man named
Pyamon. which had ye yeft of all humylyte and benygnytee. and of reuelaco^n /
On a time when he sacrefysed to god. he saw an angel nigh his awter. holding
a book in which was written ye names of some relygyouses assystent to his awter
/ and some he wrote not / After ye sacrefyce done he axed of them of whom the
names were not written / But by their ansuere he fond that they were all in
dedely syn^e Then he admonested them to duo contynuell penance / And he
himself also like as he had be culpable as they were^ wept and waylled. And
continued so long. and unto the time that in calling them unto the holy
sacrament of thawter. he knew by the angel yt he had written them in ye book
/ that they had done penance agreeable to god /

A another time he was beten of deuilles. that he might not remeue fro ye place
/ Then it happed that on a Sunday that he hadd a custom to receive his
maker / and he was constrained to be horn of his bredern to thawter / Tofore
which he lyeng flat on therth / he saw thangell ye caughte his hand for to
lift hy^ up / and forthwt he was hoole /

Of an other holy fader yt which was named John^. begy^nyng in latin Erat in
ipis locis / Caplm.xxxii.


THere was in the places aforsayd an holy man named John^. a another than he of
whom tofore is spoken^ fulfilled with all grace / Emo^ge al other he had one
such. yt all they yt went to him. of what trybulacyon they were trowbled. by
his word in contynent they were comforted / With that he heelyd many persons of
diverse dyseses / And saint Iherom says after al these hystoryes by hy^ wreton.
yt for doubt of great peryllis and dangers which then were in the way. he
durst not goo in to the hye regyon of Thebayde by Serene. whereof it is wreten
here tofore / In the which regyon like as it is said. there were many holy
faders more perfyte in virtues and graces yt in them of wham is made menco^n

Of ye peryllis yt ben on ye way for to goo to ye hermytages. and begy^nith in
latin Sepcies na^que / Caplm.xxxiii.


Saint Iherom in gooynge to the hermitages was.vii. times in danger / And in
the eyghte god delyuerde him / On a time he and his fellows were five days and
five n^ghtes in gooynge. without to have any thing to ete^ or to drink. for
to sustain and mayntene their bodyly life / Also they were in a valeye out of
which issued a salt humor / the which by the hete of the son^e Incontinent
was harded as ice / And that ice turned in to salt so rude and so sharp.
that it prycked in manner of nedles / of which ye ways were so aspre or
sharp and so diverse. that not only the bare footmen that some so went /
but also they that shoed with good and strong shoes were cut and broken /
The peril of which way saint Iherom might uneath escape / The third
peril was in a valeye. where as they were in. In the which the ground was
so soft and moryssh. that they entered up to the raynes / They seenge
theymselfe so sonken and let within thordure began to pray god. in
saying each by himself / My god god save me / for the waters have enuyronned
and closed me unto the death / I am drowned unto the botom of the slyme of the
earth. and have no strength for to socour my life / The fourth was when three
days during they were in great Inundacyons and ouerflowenges of waters that
were flowed over the banks out of the river of Nyle / The fifthe peril in
gooyng by the sea side / where as they were chaced of thieves about of.x. mile
way / And notwythstondynge that ye thieves did to hem none harm nevertheless
they made them to run / that they were almoost deed for traueyle / The syxte
was in passy^ge over ye flood of Nyle. where as they were in great and
merueylous danger to be slain The seventh was upon the ryuage of a lake or
ponde called Marethse. for they were born by Impetuse and terryble wyndes in a
merueylous isle. in yt which they were in a traunse for the great cold yt was
there / The which thing happend to them in the days of yt so lempnyte of
thepiphanye / The.viii. was in coming to the monasteryes of Nytrye. in which
place they found a great stagne or ponde coming out of ye water of Nyle. in
which place were in fynyte nombre of merueyllous beestes. and pryncypally
serpents venomous. named Cokadrylles / the which beestes when ye son^e shone
came to the ryuage of the said stagne. and lay there like as they had been deed
/ And when they cam^nye for to see them. wenyng yt they had been deed /
Inco^tynent they aroos for to devour them. and they wyste not what to do but
call the name of god yt which Inuocaco^n made. the said beestes Incontinent
fled to within ye ponde as they had be chaced by an angel of heaven / After yt
they were escaped fro ye said places. they went to ye monasteryes of Hermytes
and Religiouses for yield thankynges to god. which for so great perils and
dangers had delyuerd them / In consyderyng the said perils may clearly and
openly be known that saint Iherom ne the other gloryons saints have not
without to suffer great and merueyllous pains and trybulaco^ns come to ye
reame of heaven / But desiryng to come to the same / have been content not oonly
to forsake the vanytees and delectacyons of the world / But also some to
expose their bodies to bear terryble and strayte penau^ces. And other to suffer
horrible torments unto the death abiding the retrybuco^n of the souerayn
rewarder Ihesu Christ / To whom be attrybued glory / honor. and puyssaunce
eternally / Amen /

Here folowen the lives and fayttes of holy faders of Egypt that dwelleden in
Syrye and Thebayde / Like as saint Iherom fond them antentyely wreten in
Greek / And after by him translated in to Eatyn / To whom he adiousted many
other deeds of the said holy faders / Which by other translatours had be
verytably translated /

And first folowith shortly ye Prologue of saint Iherom in ye life of saint Poul
the first hermyte / and the foresaid Prologue begynyth in latin Ini multos /
Caplm.xxxiiii.



MAny ask says saint Iherom who was ye first hermyte / Some say Helye^ and
other say saint John^. which began to prophecye tofore he was borne / Other
say saint Anthonye / But saint Machaire and Amathas discyples of saint
Anthonye sayen yt a Thebaien named Poul was ye first. which began ye life of
an hermyte. Not only yt in hy^ was begone the name. yt which oppynion
approves saint Iherom / But nevertheless for asmoche as it semyth to be a vayn
curyosyte for to will and desire to know who was ye first. and also yt in
that lies no thing yt is somoche helthfull. it is much better and more
vaylable to dispose and appli^ hy^ to follow the other good manners and virtues of
ye holy faders. than to tarry of a thing of so little valewe /

Of ye lif of saint Poul first hermyte begy^nyng Sub decio / ca^.xxxv^


IN the time of Decyen and Valeryen persecutours of the faith of Christ. and
that Cornelius a^t Rome and Cypryan at Cartage excersyced their wood tyra^nye /
Many holy and devout Christian men were martred in Egypt and in Thebayde. in
such wise that ye church was for that cause merueylously persecuted / and the
name of our blessed savior Ihesu Christ horrybly dispysed and defouled /
Then to this purpose saint Iherom recountynge.ii. tyran^yes emonge the other.
co^mysed and perpetred by the said Cyprian tellyth of a martyr. whom he
enforced to endure many torments of fire. which could never hurt him ne do
to him any gryef or harm. the which thing the said Cypryan bare aygrely /
And by great cruelte he did him to be enoynted with honey. and did do bind
his hondes byhynde his back. to the end yt the bees and flies should sore and
long stynge and prycke him / To a another young man whom he cowde not overcome
by torments / He did do make a fetherbed well arrayed in a fair gardyn full
of reed rooses and flowers de lys / nigh to afayre rennynge water / To which
bed he made him fast. without to do to him any gryef. in such wise that he
cowde not rise ne torn on the one side ne on that other. And after that each
man was departed. made a common woman. which was excellent and was perfyghte in
bodyly beauty / which enbraced him. and making to his body foul to wchy^ges
and dyshonest. which should be abhomynable. stynkyng. and shamfull to reherce.
and all for to move him to the sin of lecherye / The which thing seenge the
good knight of Ihu^ Christ wist not what to do. to the^de yt he which had
vaynquysshed the devil by so many torments were not overcome by a woman / And
by cause he might not putt her from him / ne had power of no membre to put
her from him / He putt out as much as he might his tongue. and bote it a
sondie with his teeth. and spitte it in the vysage of the foul and ylle woman
/ which dyshonestly kyssed him. to the end yt the playsaunce of her should not
moeue him to syn^e / But for the pain and anguisshe that he felt / he might
conserve and keep his virgynyte / And hold it against the vyolence of the
said foul and evil disposed woman / In that same time was saint Poul in the
low Regyon of Thebayde. of the a^ge of syxtene years / But nevertheless he
was well Instruce in lettres Greek and Egypcyen / He abode and dwelled faderles
and moderles. with one his sister then married He seenge the persecucyon of
the true Christian men^ went in to a town much far fro his country / And
from thens in to a mountain full of roches / At foot whereof was a great and
a merueylous pytte couerd with a stone / The which he took away and looked
therein. And found there a much fair fountain / With this there was in the
said mountain diverse habitaco^ns and dwellinges / Wherein he fond many manners
of Instruments / with which had be made in time passed secretly and forged
false money. Like as it is wretch in histories of Egypt in ye time that
Anthonye was with Cleopatra / Saint Poul louyd thene merueyllously the said
place. Eyke as god had given it to him / And there he ladde a solytary life /
In o^cupyenge deuowte prayers and abstyn^nces merueyllously / His vesture was
oonly of leaves of palm / And other mete also he ete not / In the same place on
the side of Syrye nyghe by the Sa^asyus law saint Iherom an Hermit the which
had be there shytte and enclosed thyrty yere^ without to ete any other thing
than barley breed and to dry^ke water full of ordure and fylthe / And a another
within a cysterne. the which ete but every day.v. fygges for his sustentaco^n
/ and that this is true saint Iherom callyth god and his angellis to witness /
Then for tachieue of saint Poul / We ought to know yt when he was come to
thage of.C xxx year in lyuy^ge an heavenly lyf^ In a another party was saint
Anthoaye. the which hadd lived.lxxxx. years / And by cause that he was tempted
of vaynglory / wenynge yt in the hermytages hadd none be better than he / By
the will of god it was showed to him by night yt there was one more perfyte
than he / And as soon as it was day saint Anthonye departed / And how well that
he was sore feblysshyd in his body / He went fourth with a staff in his hand
/ And putt himself in dylygence for to seek saint Poul / For it was he of whom
he had had Reuelacyon / And when he had walked unto myddaye / Not knowing what
way he should take and hold. He found a Monstre half horse and half man /
Whom the Poets name Centaure / Of whom he was greatly abashed / And he blessed
him with the sign of the Cross / And asked of him in what place saint Poul
enhabyted and dwelled To this demand or askyng the said Centaure ansuerde
some words / which saint Anthonye understood not / And after he showed hy^
the way on the right hand. and Inco^tynent as he hadd fled he vanysshed a
way fro the syghte of saint Anthonye / The which beeste saint Anthonye
doubted strongly / For we find not whether it was a monstre or a devil. But
nevertheless he went forth / And anon after in a valeye full of stones. he
saw a lytyl man having his nosethrilles turned outward. the forbede full of
ferdful horns / and his fete like to the fete of a ghoe^ / To whom saint
Anthonye replenysshed with the shield of fathe. and with the habergron of hope
as a good Champyon adressyd himself. questyonynge him what he was. The which
ansuered / I am said he a mortal dweller in this hermytage with the other /
Which have be there dysceyued by many temptaco^ns / We pray the that thou
pray for us one god only / The which is descended in to the earth for our
health / Then saint Anthonye herynge these words wept and all by wette his
fare with teeres /

For he rejoiced him of the glory of god / And of the contrary of the
destruccyon of the devil / Also he was much admerueylled how he understood ye
langage and speech of the same beeste /

And after he began to smite with a staff upon the earth saying / Acursyd
be Alexandrye / The which adoure and worship for their god thydolles / In
which the deuylles enhabyte and dwell / Ha Regyon. what may thou say /
The beestes confessen the name of god / And thou worshyppest the deuylles / In
saying these words / The same beeste vanysshed away Like as it had flowen
in the air /

After this saint Anthonye abode in his enterprise. in following the way of
wild beestes / And not knowing what way he should take. Thus continued the
second day / without to know whether it were day or night / And fynably
he found a wulfe gooynge upward toward a mountain / The which had great
thirst /

And when he saw him goone up / He went after unto a fosse or a dyche. The
which he beheld / But nevertheless by cause the place was tenebrouse or
derke. he apperceyued no thing /

Always like as he had perfyght dyleccyon / And fered no thing / he went
peasybly in to the dyche or hoole / herkenynge if there were any thing /

So abiding by feruente charytee Which putting from him all feere^ and
dread / Went so far fourth and so long / That he saw the door of a
place. In which was saint Poul /

And in approuchynge or coming nyghe to the same / He knockyd with his foot
against a stone. which made a lityll noise / The which herynge saint Poul
Incontinent shytte his door And when saint Anthonye saw his door shytte /
He abode there by the space of six hours / And fynably he said to him these
words / Poul my brother / Thou knoweste by Reuelacion of god whom that I am /
And fro whens I come / And wherefore I am common hither / I knome well that I am
not worthy to see the / But nevertheless I pray the open to me thy door /
For surely my friend I shall never depart fromhens till I have seen yt / Thou
susteynest well yt brute beestes Wherefore then^e openest not you thy door to me
yt am a be reasonable. I have sought the. and have found yt / And have
knocked to the end that you should open ye door to me / the which thing if you
do not I shall dey-here in abydyng yt / And thus tofore ye door of saint Poul^
the blessed saint Anthonye sorowed / Then^e saint Poul ansuerde to hy^ / O
knight of god no man threnyth yt / in desiring like as ye desire / and thou
thretnest mein wayllynge and saying that thou shalt deye^ if I opene not to
the ye door / And thus in smiling saint Poul opened ye door to saint Anthony
/ and wha^ it was opened. that one saluted that other by their names / And yet
hadd they never seen each other / And after that they embracyd and kyssed
together a long while / Now let us think what welcomynges and thanks full of
devotion were then^e bitwene them tweyne. Certainly it should be long to
reherce / After saint Poul began to say / Alas my brother thou haste taken
great labor for to see me / And I am no thing but a wretchyd carayne all
roten for aege / you see a man the which anon shall be come ashes or duste
/ But charity enduryth. and suffers all manner traueylle. how great someuer it
be / Now say to me my brother. how men ben governed in the world / If any be
deceived by ye temptacyon of the enmye the devil / and under what domynacion
is the world governed / And in saying such words together. came a Crow or a
bird which let fall a loof of bread tofore thise two holy men / Then^e
saint Poul said / My right dear and byloued brother. le^e us think on the
goodness of our lord. the which has sent to us our dinner / Helas he is much
merciful and lowely / It is now sith.lx. years that every day I have had
half a loof of breed. but now at thy coming god has multeplyed the por^dern.
and has sent dowble pytaun^e / Then^e by a well or fou^tayne which was
there. they rendered and gave thankynges unto god / And after they were by two
hours in doing honor that one to that other^ which of them should depart
the bread / Saint Poul said it was saint Anthonies part to do it by cause he
was his gheste Saying that honor ought always to be given to the ghestes /
Saint Anthonye said the contrary / But that it apperteyned to saint Poul / By
cause he was more auncyente and more perfyghte / For unto the perfyghte and
virtuous is honor due / And at last they holdyng the same breed between
their hondes / It was departed and divided by the grace of god. that to each of
them abode his porcyon / And after that they had eten they drank a little
water of the fountain in renderyng and gyuynge graces and thanks to god /
That done they putt them both together in prayer. And woke all the night in
prayenge to god deuowtly / O deuowte soul. Think what prayer every man now
makyth on his party / They had no fantasye of ye world In thinking what
they should ete or drink / Clooth. or to hoose. or shoo them / Alas we that been in the world can not say an (Aue maria) without to have lettynges
without nombre^ or empesshements. As every man knowyth in himself / On the
mo^^e whan^e it was day saint Poul said to saint Anthonye / It is long sith I
knew that thou dwelledest in these Regyons. For god has promised to me long
sithe: that I should have one his servant with me / But because that in
following the appostle. it is long sith that I desired to be with Ihu^ christ /
you art by him sent byder to the^de. yt thou put my body which is but earth
within ye belly of his mother which is ye earth / and with his bredern which
hen ye worms ye ben of the earth / Then^e saint Anthony began to wayle and weep
so habu^dantly yt none can write. in praye^ge him that he might hold him
company in this mortal way of the world Saint Poul ansuerde / Thou ought
not to seche that thing which is in thy possessyon / but the strange things
/ It is necessary to the to leave thy careyne and follow Ihesu Christ / And to
thine other bredern that they govern them by the ensample of thy life /
Wherefore thou shall goo to thine house / And thou shalt bring the mantell
which the bysshopp Athanase gaaf to the for to couere my body when it shall be
deed / And these words said saint Poul to saint Anthonye. not for dread that
his body should be without couerture / For never in his life he had not couerde
it. but with leaves of palms / but he said this to the end / that saint
Anthonye should depart. and that his death should not be to him sorrowful /

O how great charity is soon come emonge them that been perfyghte for one day
oonly that they had been together / Saint Poul dradde to anger saint Anthonye /
His request herd. saint Anthonye was merueylously abashed how he knew yt
saint Athanase hadd given to him a mantell / And by that he knew that he had
god in his hert^^ And therefore he durst not answere^ b^^ kyssed him so swetly
and so brotherly / both his eyes and hondes in weping great teeres. that he
might not well depart from him / And after he came again in to his hermytage /
And by cause that saint Anthonye was much feeble by cause of his abstynences.
might not so soon come as his courage constrained him / And thus as he came
in to his little house / two of his discyples came metynge him / And said to him
Where haste thou be so long fader What haste thou be so long from us Helas
we supposed to have lost yt / and doubted that thou had ben deed / Thou
art tyght welcome / For the heaviness that we had for thy departing Thy
coming again has rendered to us Joy without melancolye / He ansuerde to
them / Helas I am a poor synar unworthy to be named Relygyouse / I have seen
Helye and Johan in deserte / And verily I have seen saint Poul in heaven / And
Incontinente he took in his celle the mantell for to return toward saint
Poul /

Then the bredern demanded of him the cause why he was so heavy and so
sorrowful / And he answered to them / That there was a time to speak. And a
time to be stylle / Then he took a little mete / And returned by the way
that he came / Desiring syngulerly to see the holy Heremyte Poul. Doubting
also that he should render his soul to god in his absence / And after fynably
he went with so great dylygence as was to him possible / and in such wise.
as that he had not walked but three hours / Whan^e he saw (...) ^^ule of saint
Poul among the an (...). Appostles / Prophets. and marters pure. clean and
white as snow borne up in to heaven / And Incontynente he fell down to the
earth / And covered his heed with sonde in saying /

Wherefore Poul leuest thou me / Helas wherefore ghost thou without saying to me
a dieu / or farewell / Helas I have ouerlate known the / And over soon you
ghost / Now have I lost all comfort Helas if I had not seen the ne known I
should not now have the harm ne evil that I have / O man of god. make thy
request now in that hye place / where as the angels have borne the to / that I
may by very faith goo soon and follow the / After yt he had well egrely
wept and waylled. he was and found himself also light as a bird or a foul
fleenge and not without cause / For he being arrived at the hermytage of saint
Poul / He fond him knelynge on his knees vnmoeuable. his head being lift up
on high and his ho^des Joined in such wise as saint Anthonye had supposyd as
he had been yet alive / But by cause he drew no brethe. he wyste well he was
deed / He was abowte to burye him. in saying psalms and ympnes / like as
then was the custom to burye ye faders of Egypt / He supposyd to have putt
him in to the earth / But he found neither pykeys ne shouel for to make a pytt
or grave / Whereof his heaviness was encreaced. consyderyng that he might not
lightly make it / For it was four Iourneyes unto his monastery / And of that
other part. he thought in himself. that without pyk^oys and shouel he
myghte^e do no thing / He being (...) malencolye. concluded in himself bide
there till he should deye nyghe to the laid body. And thus thinking came two
lions suddenly. which made saint Anthonye sore aferde / But he anon returned
toward god by deuowte orison / And anon was assured. and had no more fere ne
dread / And he beheld the lions. which began to waylle. and lamente by the
corpse of saint Poul / Like as they had had understanding reasonable / And after
their wayllynges / they made a deep pytte of the length of the holy saint Poul
/ The which made they came to saint Anthonye / and lycked his hondes and fete
Like as they had axyd his benedyccyon for their reward that they had there
done / Then saint Anthonye in praysynge god said / O my lord and my god
without the prouydence of whom one oonly leef of the tree fallyth not to the
ground / Give to these lions that which thou know that ought to be given
to them / And after blessed them with the sign of the Cross. to the end
that they should goo their way / And after when they were departed. he putt
the body in the earth the best wise he might / And on the morn came again /
And as his heir brought his robe of leeues / the which he ware or Eester day
and Whytsondaye oonly / Upon this matere for to excyte them that have so
much pain. for to hope and to assemble by neclygent ways towns. castelles.
lordshippes. and other temporell gods in so great quantyte. and the which
some time beg in the end of their days / Saint Iherom knowing the holy
life of the said glorious saint Poul / which never had suffraunce ne
Indygence. makyth to them such an exhortacyon /

Think thou prowe man that drynkest and etest in vessellis of gold and
silver. and gayely made fair and rich with precyouse stones / Think that to
the deuowte and holy man. Which hadd not but oonly one Robe of leaves of Palm
was heaven opened. And to the proud is hells made ready Think in like wise of
thy sepulture composyd of stones. of marble. or of silver and gylce / Or that
is covered with velvet. with which thou may be burnt / Helas the holy man
hadd not but a little of earth / Helas ye worldly men deporte or forbere you /
And take not so much pain to gadre and hepe richesses / Alas how is a man so
much a fool for to burye a another in clothe of gold or of sylke / For
Incontinent and as soon as a man which has lived evil and synfully is out
of this world / He is but in wepynges and in waylynges / The sepulcre of gold
ne the does of parement may not raunson^e him fro the pains that he suffers
/

Alas poor proud man. wolt thou deye in thy pride. that desyrest to be buried
so costle we / Fro whens comyth this folly / When thou haste be ambycyous in
thy life. and that has be made to the so many vain honors / Thou desyrest
yet. that they yet should be made to thy careyne after thy death / And often
perauenture some have fair and rich sepulture. of whom the soul suffers
hard pain /

Here folowyth the life of saint Anthonye Abbot / Which first was brought in
to writing. and sent by saint Anathase to the bysshopp of Alexandrye / And
after by saint Enagrion priest translated out of Greek in to latin. and put it
to this present book. which is made of holy faders / And begynnyth in latin
Igitur Anthonius. etc. Caplm.xxxvi.


Saint Anthonye born in Egipte was come of right noble pare^tes. as was of
noblesse of lignage. as of holy conuersacyon / He was nourysshed so solytaryly
that he knew no man of the world / but only his friends. When he was a
little great that is to wit in his Infancye. he would not goo play with little
chyldern. but he went in to the church. herynge ye service of god / And
notwythstondynge yt the children of rich houses had a custom to be
delicyously nourysshed with diverse metes / Nevertheless saint Anthonye desired
them never / but was content with such as men gaaf to him / After ye death of
his friends he abode faderles in thage of.xix. or.xx. year. and with hy^ dwelled
his sister. whom he governed and taught in good deeds and works. and thus
passy^g ye tyme^ vi. mo^thes. hau^ting ye church. he thout how thapostles left
all their substance and goods for to follow their sweet lord and master
Ihesu Christ / On a time he being in the church herd one read a gospel /
Which made mencyon how our lord said to a Rich man / If thou wolt be
perfyghte selle all that thou haste and give it to the poor. and come follow
me. And for that thou shall have tresour in heaven / And Incontinent like as the
holy scripture makych mencyon. he gave over all his possessions / And three
hundred mesures or acres of land. which apperteyned to him. he left to his
neighbors / to the end that he would no thing of theyrs. ne of his sister /
Al his other moeuable goods he sold. and took the money. and gave it to poor
people. except a little which he gaaf to his sister. which was of ^as^e aege
and more f^ble of complec^nn than he was And after again he returned to the
^hy^^he / And herd ^adde in the gospel that no man ought to think how he
should live on the morn / And then he distrybuted the rysydue of his gods
to poor people. And after that he would no more return home to his house / But
recomended his sister to the vyrgynes / To the end that by their good ensamples
she should be the better enfourmyd in good manners All his desire was to inquire
where he should find any holy men for to vysyte them to the end that he
might receive some fruit / Like as the be gooth fro flower to flower for to
gadre some thing for to make his honey and ware / Emonge the other there was
one solytary man not far fro his house / Whom he often vysyted / After yt he
was returned to his hermytage. he gate his living by the labor of his hondes
/ considering that he which labourith not is not worthy to ete / Helas he had
somoche riches which he had given for goddis sake / For the honor of whom.
and in obeyenge his worthy Instruccyons. he was content afterward to labor /
and to beg / What shall thou do ^ thou cursyd auaricyous man. which wolt no
thing give for goddis sake / Uneath and with great pain would thou nourysshe
a poor person one hoole day / Take ensample on saint Anthonye / which left
al for to be a poor beggar / Yet of that he wanne with his great labor / he
kept for him but bread for his sustenau^ce / And the remenau^t he gaaf to the
poor / He governed him so honestly. that he was merueylously biloued of all
his bredern / Of al them that he vysyted he held to himself some virtue / Of
that one he wanne contynence and chastytee. of an other gladness. of an other
meekness and lowlynesse: of a another study and pacyence / And fynably he had
the fair virtue of charytee / which is the maystresse of all virtues / And in
such wise he profited fro virtue to virtue. that emonge all his bredern there
was none like to him / The devil of hell envy to mankind. seenge the holy
life which saint Anthonye began to lead. was enuyuous. and enterprysed to
tempte him / First he laid tofore his eyes to the end yt he should depart out
of his hermytage the noblesse of his birth. his sister whom he had left alone.
thabu^da^ce of his gods. and of ye goods that he might get / the diverse
metes that he might ete. and generally he presented to him all things
playsau^t to nature / And after he showed him how it was hard to get virtue.
seen and considered the freelte of his bddy^ And yt he might yet live long
time / Wherefore then should he be then long in deserte / All these things
putt he in his mind for to have reuokyd him from his good purpoos / But this
notwithstondyng he overcame always the devil by deuowte prayers and ferme
constaunce. Often times he tempted him in the sin of the flesh. and that
was by cause he was in his young aege But by long fastings and contynuell
abstynences he wythstode it manly / Some time by night the devil apperyd to
him in the likeness of a fair woman / But Incontynente for to wythstonde it.
he remembered how his flesh should rote in worms hastily / A another time the
devil moeuyd and styred him to live Ioyoeusly in lusts of his flesh and of
the world / And then^e anon he would bring to remembrance the pains and
tourmentes of hell. and the Joys of heaven / And by this manner he wythstode
all the temptacyons of the devil / Fynably when the devil saw that he might
not overcome the good holy man / He knelyd down to him in the semblaunce or
likeness of a little horrible child black and howlynge / And also in cryenge
said to saint Anthonye / I have deceived many heremytes and holy men but by
the I am overcome and put under foot / Saint Anthonye then^e asked him what he
was to whom he ansuerde / I am the great solycytour of Lecherye. the deceyuer
of young peple^ called the spyryte of fornycacyon. which often times have
tempted the. and always thou have overcome me / And when the good knight saint
Anthonye herd this ansuere / he began to yield thankynges to god. of this that
he had put him under foot. and said / My god be thou my aid and my Protectoure
/ And I shall never fere ne dread mine enmye. And Incontinent the devil which
was seen by saint Anthonye as a fantasme. vanysshed away / and he saw him no
more / And thus was the first vyctory given to saint Anthonye / But this
notwythstondynge he was not well assured / For he knew by holy scripture. that
the devil had diverse manners for to tempte men / Wherefore he kept him more
strongely then^e. and put his body in great suffraunce. to the end that if he
had vyctory in any things against the devil. he should not be ouercom by other
And for this cause he occupied his time in prayers and orysons more than any of
his bredern heremytes The most part he woke night and day / he ete but one
time on the day. and that was after the son gooynge down / Some time in three
or four days he ete not but ones. and that was bread and salt. and a little
water / His bed was of Ionckes. and his vestyment of hair / Often times he
lay all naked upon ye ground / And how well that he had long time such
abstyne^ces. yet were they to him no thing grievous / But thought always to
be at the beginning of his penance in encreacyng always his said abstynences
/ And for teschewe vay^glory / he did pain to forgete them / And in deed he
forgate all the good deeds that he had done: And enforced to do more than he
had done tofore / He remembered always in his heart the prophet Helye. that
said / My god sees to whom we ought to be clean and apparayled to obey him
with ready will / He considering always also how he ought to govern himself
every day while he lived / And having no regard to the time passed / At
all hours he prepared to be in such estate as it apperteyneth to a veryry
Christian man and catholyque /

Saint Anthonye then^e thus living departed from his hermytage / And wence
ferder from the cite / And sense to one his kynnesman that in certain days he
should send him for to live for the sustentacyon of his life / which
kynnesman and friend did it gladl^ / On a time it happed that he hyselfe came
for to v^syte him / And after that he hadd vysyted him. He left him allone
fast shytte / And the deuylles came in great multitude. which brake up the
door / And beat him so much that he had lost his voice / and his herynge /
And he being left so fore hurt and wounded / that the pain of his wounds
surmounted all torments of mankind / when he that brought him to ete
returned to him / and found his door broken. and himself half deed. he took
him on his neck. and bare him unto his house / He being there. the neighbors
and friends came to / and saw him almoost dede^ began merueyllously to weep
/ And so long endured that fynably for gryef they fell a sleep. except he
that brought him / The night being come / saint Anthonye lift up his head
and saw him that brought him thither slepte not / Then he prayed him that he
would here him again to his hermytage / And he so did in obeyeng his great
prayers / And when he was in his hermytage. he put himself in prayer. the
which done and fynysshed He began to cry with an hye voys in speaking to the
deuylles / O ye enmyes dampened and wicked I Anthonye an here. and am not fled
/ And though ye do to me more martyrdom and pain yet shall ye not conne
depart me fro ye love of Ihesu Christ / And yet more over he said if all the
world were against me. I shall dread no thing / The devil seenge that he had
suffered somany torments. merueylled how he was so hardy to return / Then
the devil called his cursed dogs and said / Ne see ye not how this folysshe
hermyte agryth and scornyth us. by cause he has not be overcome neither by
the spyryte of fornycacion ne also by betynge Ne by the pain that we have done
to his body / Make ye ready. for he must by us be more pugnisshed than he was
before / He shall right soon ^ete what we ben / And Incontinent was made a
great tempeste. that the house was broken on al sides / And therein entered a
innumerable multitude of deuylles in diverse forms / Some in likeness of
bulls. and other of lions. of dragons. of wulues. of addres. of serpents and
scorpyons. and the other in other diverse forms. as of liepardes / tygres and
be^es. each of hem cried after his nature / The lion cried in his cry.
willing to slay him / and the bulle thretnynge him with his horns. / and so
every beeste tormented him in his manner / As towchy^ge his bodi he was much
febled. but as to wchynge the soul. he was constau^t and a bydynge in the love
of god. and mocked them all and said to the deuylles / If ye have strength
there nedyth but one to assaylle me / and yet more over he said to them / If
ye ben puyssau^t and god has give you power over me. I am ready yt ye devour
me / and if he has yeuen to you no power / wherefore enforce ye so yourself /
Know ye not well that ye sign of the Cross is the shield of faith and a
wall inexpugnable for to defend us against you / And heryng they grunted with
their teeth of the dyspyte that they had of that they were mocked of him.
without to have any power over him / Wherefore our lord why the leuyth not his
servants in daungeour / Seenge the vyctorye of his good knight saint
Anthonye / came for to vysyte him / Descendynge as a light in to his
habytacyon / After which light received. all his pains and soores were
heelyd / And his house which was al to broken was Incontinent made again Saint
Anthonye knew then that god was come to comfort him / And began to cry /
O my god / O good Ihesus where were thou when I was thus scorged all this day
why came thou not at beginning for to heel my wounds and soores / The
voice ansueryd / Anthonye I was here / But I tarried thy vyctorye / And now by
cause thou haste strongly foughten. I shall always help the / And shall make
thy name be renommed thorugh out all the world / The which voice herd. He
aroos up. and was more strong and constaunte to pray god than^e he was tofore
/ And he was at that time.xxxv. year old And after whan^e his virtues began
to grow / He came to an aeged fader which dwelled nigh to him / of whom is
spoken tofore / Prayenge him that they might dwell together / Nevertheless by
cause that he should not complain of his old aege / And also because that he
had not be accustomed to be conuersaunt with any person / Saint Anthonye
desiring to live solytaryly / And taking example of the said holy fader.
went all alone unto a mountain / And in gooynge thither the devil which
cessyd not to tempte him. laid in his way a plater full of silver / The
which saint Anthonye seenge ouerthwartly. in thynkyng that the said plater
hadd be laid there by the deuylles craft / By cause that in ye way came not
but birds and wild beestes / And then said saint Anthonye / Goo thou
dampened devil / thou and thy silver in to eternal perdicyon / And that said
the plater vanysshed awaye^ as fume or smoke departyth from the fire / And
after that he saw a great mass of gold / And for fere thereof he fled to
the mountain / Like as he would have eschewed a great fire / And after that he
had passed a great flood. he found a castle in deserte full of venimouse
beestes / In which he abode as a new host / And Incontinent as he was
lodged. all the beestes fled away / Then^e he stopped then tree with stones
And laid as much breed therein as should suffyse hy^ for.vi. months / Now it
was so yt the bread of Thebayde endured long as the space of a year or there
abowte / Never after he would not depart ne speak to man of the world but
twyes only in the year / And took his sustentacyon under couuerture without
to speak to them that brought to him the said sustentaco^n / Many freres
desyry^ge to see him. waked all the night at his door / the which often times
herd voices saye^ge to saint Anthony / Wherefor put thiselfe in our
habytacles Goo out of our bounds / For thou shall not mow suffer our
temptacyons / And they had supposed that it had been men that hadd entered by
ladders / Wherefore they looked within the cave through the c^euyces / And by
cause they saw no person. they esteemed that the^ were deuilles that so spoke
to him / Then they were aferde in such wise yt they cried for help to saint
Anthonye. and then^e he came night to them. and with his word be comforted
them in saying / Bless ye you and be assured. Let the deuylles deceive
themself / Saint Anthonye always lived in encreacyng his virtue and prudence /
On a time came some persons to him. of which some supposed to have found him
deed. but by himself he said singing To my will god enhaunsyth himself And all
his enmyes ben destroyed / and al they that hate him fleetofore his face. like
as smoke is consumyd soon. so sone faylle they / And like as ware mel^yth
against the fire so perysshe they yt ben synnars tofore god / And more over he
said / All folk have assaylled me in the name of our lord. and I have
vainquysshed them / And thus in that wilderness he was by ye space of twenty
year / And by cause that many desired to see him for to follow his manners and
his doctrine. came some in to his house and brake it by force / But when they
saw him they were amerueylled how he was so hoole of his members / For he was
not swollen by his long abiding enclosed. ne by his fastings. ne by
torments of the deuyllis / And his vysage was not pale ne changed but he was
as a yo^ge person. also clean of all his members. as he never hadd any harm /
He never laughed / And with al his might he kept him fro sin / He never for
any praysyng of ye people was the more proud / Many by his prayers were
delivered fro deuyllis and their power. His words were always vertuouse^ He
comforted ye desolate. He taught always the simple and Innocents. he appeasyd
always they that were angry To all he showed that no person should love any
thing more than his creator or maker / To good people he showed the glory
eternal and the meekness of god / And how god ye fader had no feere to send
his sone to take our nature to the end for to redeem us frothe pains of
hell / Also he counseyled every man not to leave te^porell things /

On a time in the conntree of A^senoytayns. as he would goo and vysyte his
brethern and his fellows / he passed the river of Nyle / without having any
harm of ye cokadrylles and other beestes that were there / In that place he
confermed in virtue great nombre of his brethern. In such wise that many
monasteryes were reedyfyed / On a day he being with his brethern / They
required him to give to them some Rules for to govern them in virtue /
Which he gaaf to them many / First that they sold comfort each other / And
that which they had gotten by science. they should show each to other / Also
that they should never have will to leave their estate of Heremyte. But to keep
it in encreasynge of virtues / For man's lyffe was but an Instau^t / as to the
regard of the life eternal After that he had proposed this / He made by a
manner of taryenge a little scylence / And after in merueyllynge of the bounte
and largess of god. he began to say again these words / O my brethern
consider ye that in this mortal life. marchaundyses and rewards ben egall /
For the seller receives for his marchaundise but thing Just of the byar / Ne
in like wise the servant but his Just deseruynge of his lord / But the
glory of the everlasting life may for vile and little price be boughte / It
is not wreton that our days excede not three score and ten years. or four
score years / And if we live longer. It is but labor and sorrow and myserye
For in that aege. a man retorneth to the state of Innocencye / But in that
other world we shall live perpetuelly / Then we shall not enhabyte the
earth. but the heaven / And the body that we shall leave corruptyble we shall
take again Incorruptyble / Therefore my brethern be no thing greuyd ne anoyed
/ For the short passions of this world ben not condygne ne worthy to the
perpetuelly of heaven / If ye have left any lityll land or possessions / Be
not dysplaysaunt ne sorry therefore / For god shall yield to you for it an hundred
fold more / They that shall have left the gods of this word for to serve god.
shall have an hundred fold more in that other world / Also ought they to
consydre. that woll set their heart in over much loving the richesse of
this world / That in the end they shall led them in to hell / We ought no
thing to love. but that oonly which we may here with us after our death /
Ought we not then to love that thing that shall cause us to goo to heaven /
That is to wit. Sapyence Chastyte. Justice. Fasting. Prayer. ^esynesse on the
poor. Ferme faith. Pacyence against ire / And generally to love god and our
neighbor as ourselfe / Consydre that we ben the servants of god / and that
we owe to him service. as to him which has created us Let us not rejoice us
of our life. for if we ben in health in the morning / Yet we be not sure to
live to even / And if in this manner we ben besye for our health. we shall
never sin / We ought also to flee hate and evil will again all persons /
And above all things love of wymmen / We ought promptly and benygnely to
forgive and pardonne each other / Tofore our eyes we ought to set two
things / that is to wit the last day of our life. which is the death /
And the nyghe Judgment of god / And if for the love of god we woll keep us from
sin / Or at leest for dread of these two things we ought to absteyne us /

Ferdermore said saint Anthonye. I pray you my brethern. look never behind
you / But goo always right fourth the good ways / that ye have begone / For
he that puttyth his hand to the plough / And lokyth behind him / He is not
worthy to have the Reame of heaven / Leave the Greeks which gone in to strange
lands / and passen over the sea. for to get the science and cunning of vain
things / We have no thing to do. to goo hytherne thither / For the Reame and
regyon that we pretend to have / Like as god wytnessyth in the gospel is
within us / Ne doubt not that if our soul be not maculate or spotted. ne
defoyled with sin / That in her shall be the fountain of all virtues /
Then it is of necessyte that it be good /

For it is created or made of a master / which is sovereign good / that is
god out Creatoure and Maker / Let us consydre the words of our Sauyoure
Ihesu Christ. saying Do ye so that ye have the heart clean to the god of
Israhell / And in like wyle says saint Johan / which says / Do ye so that
your ways be ryghtfull pure and clean / Governed by the faith of god / Now
for to do so it byhouyth us for to keep us from the spotte of sin / We
ought souerainly and ^^atly for to keep us from ye or w^athe / For when the
man is angry / With right great pain may he do any work agreeable or
playsaunt unto god / By cause that ire or wrath empessheth and lettyth virtue
/ The which is none other thing but god /

Yet after also said saint Anthonye to the Relygyouses / My little children
keep you from vain words. and fro pride / Some there ben that enterpryce and
avaunte them to do well / But they follow not the deed which they
enterprysed and purposed / Other there ben that clothe them and array them
with vestymentes of Relygyouses / and follow Relygyon / to the end to seem and
appyere good / But within their hertes they ben wulues enraged / And ben werse
thanne deuylles For under the shadow of good / they done Infynyte harms and
euylles /

After ye holy fader saint Anthonye showed to them some fallaces or disceytes
which the deuylles done in diverse manners and mockynges / In saying that
often times the devil shows him to the holy men in likeness of men / In
blaundysshynge them and flaterynge them with fayte and sweet words / And in
praysynge their estate and constaunce / And often times promyseth that / which
they may not give / That is the glory and Joy of heaven / For to eschew such
Illusyons and mockynges / When they ben felt coming Ought men to enseygne
and bless them with the sign of the Cross / And Incontinent it shall turn
in to naught / For by the merit of the passion that our souereyne lord and
Redemer Ihesu Christ suffered in the Cross / All such Illusyons or mockynges
sha^^lese their strength and virtue / He said also that some time come some
Illusyons or deceyuynges. which cause terror and dread to them that the
deuylles admynystre them. And that done they for to taken away from men their
mind But against such Illusions or scornynges byhouyth to have steadfast
faith / And so shall it be wythstonde lightly / For to know then the
dyfference of good and evil angellis / It ought to be known / that when
the good angel comyth / His chere and regard is sweet and amyable or lovely
And by cause he desires but peace / He makyth none noise ne clamoure / And his
voice is not herd / He gyuyth Joy and exultacyon to synnars / For our lord
is with him / which is well and fountain of all good / Incontinent also as
our soul sees him / if it were to him possible. he should break the members
of the body / and would goo with the good angel when he is there present / The
benygnyte of the same angel is so great / that if he caused any dread at
ye beginning for his great light. Incontinent he takyth away from the man
all dread and fere / Right so did Gabryell to Zatharye being in the Temple /
and also with the Shepeherdes / when he showed the Natyuyte of Ihesu Christ.
But of the evil Aungelles / the countenance and chere is crimynell and
dredefull / His entree horryble^ Their mocyon and way is Inconstaunte / As of
fools or of thieves / And Incontinent as they ben tofore men. the soul fe^eth
and dredyth / All the five wits ben trowbed / And feere of death folowyth /
Desire of shrewdnes: Lachednesse of virtue / And wekenesse of courage. Then
when to the understanding comyth a thought or a presentaco^n in likeness
of an angel After the dread. presentyth him Joy Hope in god. and charity / We
ought veritably to believe that this comyth from god / Which sends to us his
aid and socoure / In such wise Abraham the Patryarke seenge god. rejoiced him
/ In like wise saint Johan Baptyste being in the womb of saint Elyzabeth his
mother / When the glorious vyrgyne Mary mother of our Sauyoure Ihesu Christ
came to vysyte her / He which was not yet borne^ rejoiced him merueyllously /
By which it apperyth that the good angel at his coming gives consolacyon
and comfort / And makyth the person to be assured. As he did when he showed
the right Ioyeous Natyuyte of our Savior Ihesu Christ to the same glorious
vyrgyne Marye. in saying to her / Marye be not aferde. for thou haste found
great grace toward god / And the contrary by apperynge and represe^tacions of
evil angellis have be many times deceived the gentyles and Paynems / But we
Christian men ben preseruyd. By cause that god has taken away from the devil
the domynacyon and power that he had upon us. when he said to him Goo
thou abacke Sathanas / It is wreton that thou shalt adoure and worshipp thy
god / and oonly shall thou serve to him / By these same words which god said
to the devil He took his power from him /

There is also given to us power to say to him when he would tempte us Goo
abacke Sathanas And Incontinent he shall be vaynquysshed / And shall depart
from us / After saint Anthonye prayed they that they should not be curyous to
do miracles / to the end / That if they or one of them by the virtue of our
lord made any / they should not run for that cause in to dampnable vice of
pride and of vain glory / In like wise he defended to them: that they should
not despise that one the other. But exhorted them that they should pain
theymselfe to lead together good life and honest /

Also said he for to do and make miracles is not in our power / But in the
power of god / For he says in ye Gospel in speaking to his dyscyples /
Gloryfye ye not if the deuylles ben subgett to you. but reioyece ye you that
your names be^ wrete in heaven. Here it is to be noted. that they that done
miracles and prodygees by art magyke / Without to have the gift of the grace
of god. whan^e they shall cry to god Have we not driven away the deuylles in
thy name / And many other virtues have been done in calling the / and making
Inuocacyon to god the blessed and very Judge / To them that he knowyth that
heryth not his sign / He shall ansuere to them / Certain I know you not /
for ye have never mine enseygne / After god shall say to them / Goo ye a back
from me for ye have been always evil children of Inyquyte / Saint Anthonye said
afterward / By cause it is hard to know the coming of the good angel or
evil / We ought to pray him that it playse him to give to us science to
conne dyscerne / For after the scripture we ought not believe every spyryte /
On a time the deuylles came to saint Anthonye / Which said to him. Anthonye
we come to show to the our light / And Incontinent saint Anthonye closyd his
eyes. and would not see them / But put himself to prayer his even closyd /
And anon the light of the deuyllis quenched /

A another time they came and song tofore him / And spoke together of holy
scripture / But that notwythstondy^ge saint Anthonye stopped his eeres /

A another time they made his monastery to tremble and shake / But he in his
thought abode vnmoeuable / And prayed to god constauntly / Often times they
came spryngynge and syflynge tofore him with an high voice.

But Incontinent as he returned to god. their noyce and tempest turned into
lityll noyce / that uneath said saint Anthonye might here it.

On a time cam^ one which had his body wonderly great and said he had the
virtue of god / The which demanded of saint Anthonye what he would have of
him / And when he saw him so great. He armyd him Incontinent with prayer /
And took the sheelde of faith / By which anon he became as lytyl as half a
foot A notherey me came the devil in form of a Relygyous man and brought to
him and said to him / It is time that thou ete / thou haste ouerlonge fasted /
Take corporell refcceyon. to the end that thou be not seek / Anon after saint
Anthonye byhelde him. and saw that his face was pale / And putt himself to
prayer / And then the devil went his way by ye wyndowe. like unto fume or
smoke / A another time he presented him gold for to dysceyue him / But he never
would look on it / A another time came the devil and knocked at the door of
his monastery. and when saint Anthonye went out. he saw him so great. yt him
seemed yt his heed raughte to heaven Then^e saint Anthony demanded him what he
was. and what thing he sought / And he ansuered that he was called Sathanas /
And that he came thither. by cause the Relygyouses despised him / And all
Christian men cursyd him / And saint Anthonye ansuerd that it is well right and
requysyte that all Christian folk despise and curse him / For often by his
temptacyons he brought them in hate / the one against a another / Where upon
the devil ansuered^ that he did not. But they theymself were angry togider /
And more over the devil said to him / That the might and puyssaunce of the
deuylles was faylled by the moyen of the passion of Ihesu Christ / And that they
had no more no cytee ne other place for to enhabyte in / By cause the name of
god was reclamed and named in all towns and cytees / And also in deserts.
which ben enhabyted by Relygyouses and heremytes / Then saint Anthonye
having the grace of god with him ansuered prudently / I believe not that thou
weneste to say truth / For thou art the captain of lesy^ge and of
fallaces But thou art constrained to say this sentence. which is true /
Certainly Ihesu Christ pryued the of all thy strengthest and virtues sith the
time that thou lostest thy beawte of an angel by the spotte of thy sin /
And Incontinent that saint Anthonye had achyeuyd his prayer / The said devil
vanysshed away

Saint Anthony said then to his relygiouses / My brethern dread not the
Illusyons of the devil / For god which has putt from us the deuylles / And
that aybdyth with us / As long as we ben in grace / He shall keep us from
their diverse temptacyons /

Let us set our charge to resyste and wythstonde their tytulacyons and
cauyllacyons as much as we may / For when they know that our thoughts
ben vain. freeyll and Inconstaunt They put them in. to the bodies of men /
And as thieves. hounds. and wulues enraged. they rauysshe body and soul / Job
by his steadfast faith overcame the devil / And Judas was the contrary / The
pryncypall thing and most necessary for to vaynquysshe and overcome the
devil. is to take playsaunce in spyrytuell things / and to have contynuelly
his heart to god / This virtue makith the deuylles to flee. as the smoke
vanysshyth away / Therefore my brethern said saint Anthonye if any vysyon come
to us / it must hardely be demanded. who is he that prese^tyth him tofore us /
and whens he comyth / And if it be the angel of god / The dread that we had
shall to urne Incontinent in to Joy / But and if it be the devil / And if he
be demanded of a devout soul / Incontinent he shall depart / After that
saint Anthonye had made his exhortacyons / Eeuery one of the brethern was
merueyllously enjoyed / And after they enforcyd them to get virtues / And
they that hadd had tofore but little faith were confermyd^ and hadd
perfy^ghte faith / And the other took away all folysshe oppynyons from their
thoughts / In such wise that after they dradde not any temptacion of the
devil / But were more abashed how saint Anthonye had them so highly
Instruct or taught them to know dyfference of the good angel and of the
wicked and evil /

In the time that Maxymyan persecuted the Christian people / Saint Anthonye left
his monastery. saying to his brethern / Let us goo with our brethern martyrs
/ To the end that we ben martred with them / Or at leest that we see them
suffer martyrdom / By the which words it appyereth many festly that then
was saint Anthonye martyr in will / And when any was brought tofore the
Judge. He comforted them in saying / that they should not feere the death /
But should be constaunt or steadfast in the faith / The Judge seeng the
constaunce of saint Anthonye and of his fellows. was hon^^bly an angryd. And
did do forbid that no Relygyous should abide in the town but if they
should keep ye law / Then all the Relygyouses went away / But saint
Anthony set no thing of his menaces and thretenynges / And showed his
Scapularye / to the end that he should be the better known for a Relygyous
man / And on the moune he showed him in a white vestement tofore the fa^e of
the Tiraunt / To the end that he was desiring to be of the nombre of the
martyrs / yt which by the will of god was kept and preseruyd from the y^e of
the Tyrant / And returned to his monastery in making lene and castisynge his
body of more sharp fastings and prayers contynuelly thanne tofore / Next his
flesh he ware the hair / And there upon a vestement of hair named Melote. He
bayned never his body ne never wysshe his fete / But by necessytee when he
passed and went thorugh the water / Never man saw his body naked / but when
he was deed.

Long time after that saint Anthonye was closyd in his monastery. not willing
to speak to any person / A prince of chyualrye. named Martynyan had a
daughter. which was meueyllously vexed of the devil. So would the said
Maxymyan goo to saint Anthonye. for to pray him that he would make his prayer
to god. that it playsed him to heel and guarysshe his said daughter / The
which Martynyan arrived there and prayed him that he would open his door /
But for what prayer that he cowde make / He would never opene it / But went
upon high / And saint Anthonye said to him / O man wherefore demanndest thou
aid or help of me / When I am mortal as thou art / If thou believe in
Ihesu Christ. whom I serve Pray to him. And after thy faith thy daughter shall
be guarysshed and heelyd / The said Martinyan gyuynge faith and credence to
the words of saint Anthonye called unto the name of god And Incontinent his
daughter was heelyd and guarysshed /

Many folks also which went and slepte tofore the door of his said
monastery were guarysshed of diverse maladyes And saint Anthonye seenge that
from all parties people came to him / for to recouuere health. He went from
thens in to the hyhest parties of Thebayde / Where as he was not known / And
by cause that by the occasion of the great miracles and wonders that he did
and wroughte by the virtue of our lord / he should not enter in to the sin
of exaltacyon and vain glory / And also that men should not repute nor Judge
him for an holy man / He took of the breed of his brethern / for to goo in to
the highest parties of Thebayde / And went till he came to a great river. On
the ryuage or bank whereof / he herd a voice coming from heaven / Which said
/ O Anthonye whether ghost thou / Saint Anthonye as accustomyd to here such
voices / Ansuered. that he went from his monasterye / By cause that the people
left him not in peace / And the voice ansuered unto him / If thou goo thither as
thou haste enterprysed for to goo. thou shalt have more pain by the half
thanne thou haste hadd But and if thou wolte have peace / Goo in to the deserte
which is here within / Saint Anthonye ansueryd that he knew not where it was
/ And then the voice said to him. that there were Sarrasyns. which have been
accustomyd to lead marchaundyses in to Egypt Anon after saint Anthonye
aperceyued them. And prayed them to lead him with them in to the said
deserte / The which they did gladly / And when they had goon three nyghtes /
they fond a much high mountain / At the foot whereof was a fair well and
fountain / And about the same was a little field in which were palm trees
in little quantyte And when saint Anthonye saw that place / He knew well
that it was the place. which was showed to him by the voice on the ryuage or
bry^ke of the River. Then he took the bread of his fellows / In
recommaundyng them to god / And abode there all alone / After that his
brethen hadd knowledge of the place where he was / They sent him always his
pytaunce / And by cause he saw well that it was great pain for to bring to
him his sustentacyon / Sent to one of his Religyouses that he should bring to
him a shouell or a spade. with two forkes of yren. and some whete / The which
brother so did And anon after / he found couuenable land to labor in the
mountain / The which he sewe with whete / And it multeplyed so greatly / that
he gadred enough for to sustain his lyffe / Whereof he was much Ioyeous and
glad / Seenge that he might live without gyuynge to any person any pain
or traueylle /

And by cause that some folks came thither / He augmented and encreacyd his
labor in the little land for to give Refeccyon to the comers to his
hermytage / And when the corn was great / The beestes that were there ete it
He did so much that he took one / And in speaking to all the foresaid
beestes he said to him / Wherefore do ye to me dysplaysure. sith that I do
none dysplaysure to you / Goo ye fourth in the name of our lord Ihesu Christ /
and come no more hither / To the which words the said beeste and all the
other obeyenge departed all fro there abowtes / Thus lived saint Anthonye long
within the pyttes and fosses in the same mountain / And wha^ sometime his
brethern sent to him olives. or of the oil. or other fruit. for to sustain
his old aege / he would none /

In ye mountayn he had many bataylles. not oonli against the flesh. but also
against the deuylles which often brought to him such tempeste. that it seemed
that all the mountain were full of men of arms / Who well consydreth the
wonderful life of saint Anthonye he is worthy of great praysynge / Seenge his
perseueraunce in abydyng so long time in one place solytary without seenge any
person / But on that one side wild and cruel beestes^ and the deuylles on
that other side / which came to beat and tormente him / And nevertheless he
was never in will to leave his hermytage / But abode always in his fe^me
purpoos to serve god^ considryng ye saying of the prophet Dauyd / Who someuer
shall have very faith and steadfast hope in god. shall never have empeshement ne
lettynge yt may noye hy /

On a night as he woke in saying his prayers came about him al ye wild
beestes of the deserte. which enforced them for to byte him / Then^e saint
Anthonye said to them. If ye have license to noye me / come to me and devour
me / And if ye be come hither. by thentysement of mine aduersarye goo fro me^ I
am the servant of god / And Incontinent like as they had been hunted they
fled away /

A another time as saint Anthonye made a tresse for to make a little basket /
For his custom was to give somethynge to them that brought to him of their
goods / A beeste having the face of a person. and the Resydue of an Asse^
drew from his hondes the said tresse / And Incontinent as he saw that / He
blessed him with the sign of the Cross / And said I am the servant of god /
If thou be sent to me in his name / I shall not flee from the / and anon he
vanysshed a way / Other moo great things did saint Anthonye. as it shall
appyere here after /

His brethern on a time prayed him that he would come and see them / And by
cause that upon the way being between his hermytage and the place where as
were his brethern was no water / He did do charge mete and water upon a
Camel for to sustain the necessytees of him and them that were with him /
When they were at the myddyll of the way / their water faylled / And they
had so great thirst that they were well nyghe deed / by cause of the great
heete that there was / And let their Camel goo act the adventure of god /
And the good saint Anthonye moeuyd with pity went behind his fellows And put
himself to prayer / The which done / suddenly apperyd a fountain / of which
they were all refresshed and eased And anon after they sechynge their Camel
for to give to him drink fond him casuelly bounden with his cord to a great
stone / Their way accomplysshed and at end / saint Anthony and his brethern
came to the monasterye where as were his brethern / And anon they came hastily
to him. In enbracynge and kissing him / Like as he had be their own fader /
Anon after he began to comfort their souls / In praysynge the auncyentes
and aeged / And in exhorting the young to virtuous living / And among other
things he said to them they should often read the lives of the good ancient
or aeged faders / To the end that by their virtues they might be encyted and
styred to live well. And to wythdrawe from dooynge any manner evil /

One named Froncho ye which was of Palestine was tormented of a devil in such
wise that with his teeth he detrenched and bote his tongue / And with that he
enforcyd him to put out his eyes / He was brought to saint Anthonye. to the
end that he might recouuer his health / Saint Anthonye said unto him that he
should goo in to Egypt / And anon he should be guarisshed and heelyd / He
gaaf no faith to his ansuere / But abode. prayenge that he would heel him
Then he said that there he might not be heelyd / Froncho byleued in his
words And as soon as he came in to Egypt he was guarysshed and heelyd /

A vyrgyne of the regyon Trypolytane was seek of a sykenesse the most horrible
that has be seen / Fro her nose thrylles. her eyes. and her eeres came out
Incessau^tly humors and ordures so stynkynge. that it was an horrible thing
to behold and see / For the said fylthes as soon as they fell on the ground
they turned in to worms / Her friends and parents desiring her health and
hoping to obtain the same by the moyen of saint Anthonye. putt them on the
way for to lead her to him / And in gooynge they found sone some relygyouses.
which went for to see saint Anthonye / And so they prayed them that they
might goo with them / And so long they went together yt they came unto a
good man named Paphonce / to whom Maxymyen had do pulled out his eyes for the
name of Ihesu Christ / They being there arrived. the relygyouses made ye
parents and the maid to abide there with the good holy man / And they went
forth to saint Anthonye. and recounted to him the caas of the poor maid / In
prayenge him that she might come and entree in to his monasterye / Saint
Anthonye would in no wise that she should entree. but said to the relygyouses
/ Goo ye forth thither. if the maid be not deed. ye shall find her all hole
and guarisshed / And yet he said / none ought to come to me for to recouuer
health / For to give health to seek men apperteyneth to the Sauyoure of the
world / Nevertheless he said. As I prayed unto god. the health of his daughter
was showed to me / Then^e they went where as ye maid was with her fre^des in
the house of saint Paphunce / and there found her all guarysshed /

Two brethern walking for to goo see saint Anthonye. in walking that one
deyed for thirst. and that other lay stratched on the earth. and abode the
death Saint Anthonye that knowing by Reuelacyon of god. called tweyne of his
brethern / which were comen thyde to him / And said to them thus / Goo ye
hastily in the way that ledyth men in to Egypt / And also take with you a
botell with water / For ye shall find a brother deed for thirst / and a
another nyghe exspyred / The space of the way was well a Iourneye thens /
Incontinent they went and found all true that saint Anthonye had said /
They buried the deed man / And brought that other with them / If any demand
or ask wherefor saint Anthonye showed not the Reuelacyon tofore the death of
the brother / It may be ansuered that the questyon is inpropre / For the
Judgment proceeded of god. and not of saint Anthonye / In so much that god
would that the one should deye / And that other should by saint Anthonye be
restored to his health /

On a time as saint Anthonye was prayeng to god saw the soul of saint Ammon
religyous in Nytrye borne in to heaven by many angellis. singing melodyously /
A another accompanied with a good man named Theodore would pass the river
called Licuim / And by cause they might not pass ye river without they should
do of their clothes and be all naked / Saint Anthonye prayed the said
Theodore. that he would goo abacke. to the end that he should not see him bare
/ That notwtstondyng saint Anthonye being ashamed for to unclothe him. by the
grace of god. he was set over on that other side of the river / Theodore
passed the river after him. and was much admerueylled how so hastily saint
Anthonye was passed over / And took him by the fete. and swore that he would
never leave him. till he had told to him how he had passed without to be wete /
Saint Anthonye seenge that saint Theodore constrained him. and made him to
swear that he should never show to none before his death / Then he said to
him. that by the grace of god he had be so set over the river myraculously /
A another man named Archelaus a knight required him to pray god for one named
Polycrasse daughter of Publius. a deuowte vyrgyne. the which had a passion in
the stomach and in the raynes comen to her by over much fastings and long
orysons. Saint Anthonye prayed god for her. and Incontinent she was guarysshed
and hole / A another time he was prayed to goo in a ship with his brethern. In
ye which he alone felt a foul stinkyng stenche / All the relygiouses said
that ye infeccyon proceeded of fysshe and ^oten fygges that were in the ship /
But saint Anthonye said that it was a another thing / And thus as they spoke
began a child to cry. which was bydde within the ship / having a devil
within his dody. Anon in the name of god by saint Anthonye he was chacyd out
of his body / Then knew all the relygyouses that it was the devil that he
felt so stynkynge / A another was bronghte to him so seek that he ete his
superflue digestyon And ^e wyste not whether he was tofore saint Anthonye or
not / Saint Anthonye made them to goo to prayer that had brought him / And he
himself also prayed all the night unto god for the health of the poor
pacyent The which seek man at ye begy^nyng of the day for the great pain
that he felt / Smote and beat foul saint Anthonye. which all the night
had had compassyon nyghe by him in prayer / The Relygyouses being thereof
much angry. repreuyd sharply them that had brought him / But saint Anthonye
swetely and mekely ansuered / that the yo^ge man which was like had not done
it / But the devil which by the commandment was so constrained to depart
from him / had so smeton him / Anon after the seek person was all hoole. and
guarysshed / And came and enbracyd and kyssed saint Anthonye / A miracle.

On a time saint Anthonye being in prayer like as he was always acustomed to
do. tofore that he took his refraco^n was rauysshed of angels / and was born
more hye than the regyon of thayre / The deuyllis following after strove by
cause he was born hyer than the said regyon / And the angellis seenge the said
contradycco^n. asked of the deuyllis wherefore they enforcyd to let him seen
that in him was no sport of sy^ne / Then the deuyllis began to recounte the
sins that saint Anthony hadd done in the time of his young aege /
Incontinent the angellis made them to be stylle. in saying yt they should no
thing speak of the sins of his yongthe. but if he hadd done any sith that
time that he was relyygyous and professyd and consacred to god. that they should
say them and none other / The deuylles accusyd him of many falls accusacyons
and lies / And the angellis seenge that the deuyllis accusid him oonely of
fallaces. bare up saint Anthonye more high than^e the deuyllis were / And
anon after they brought him again to the place where they had taken him /
Then saint Anthonye considering the multitude of enmyes that we have in this
world. and so many in the air. as in the earth / The which always a wait
to hurt us. began to waylle and weep / And so continued all the night
without to ete or drink / And to this purpose says saint Poule thappostle /
We have not oonly bataylle against the flesh only / But also against the
deuylles. dwelling in the Regyons of the air. Let us then^e take the arms
of god To the end that we may resyste and wythstonde our enmye when he shall
assaylle us / That is for to say / That we live without sin / And so the
devil shall not mow accuse us before god / The night after following saint
Anthonye herd a voice the which cried. Anthonye. Anthonye come out / and see
what that I woll show to the / Incontinent he aroos / And when he was out
of his Celle. lift up his eyes to heaven / And so doing he saw in the air
a Monstre so horrible great / that his heed semyd stretchyng up to the clouds
/ He saw also some having wings the which would flee upward on high / But
ye great Monstre smote them down with his hondes. and threw them to the
earth. of whom some he brake all in pieces / And other against his will flew up
in to heaven / And anon as he had seen this. the voys said to him yt he should
considre well what this vision sygnefyed / Anon he knew well yt it was the
devil which made them to fall that had sinned in this world / The other
were good souls which styed up in to heaven. whom the devil might not grieve
/ Saint Anthonye seenge the said vysyon. and many other moo encreacyd and
augmented always his life from good to beteer / And how be it that he showed
these Reuelaco^ns to some right good persons / He did it not by no vain
glory / neither for auauntrye / But was so meke. That in exhorting the
clerks. the Deakens and the priests to pray god / He desired to learn of
them / And to that intent often times he demanded or axed of them counseylle
/ To all Bishops and priests / in bowynge his head by humylytee he demanded
their be nedyccyon / And like as it is comynly said / From a Ioyeouse heart
proceeds a Ioyeouse vysage / He had a playsaunte vysage and aggreable to every
man / In such wise that among an hundred Relygyouse persons. by his honest
manners he should lightly have be known / Though a man hadd never seen him /
His face was always in one astate. as well in prosperytee as in aduersytee /
Above all other things he hated the conuersacyon of Manychyens / Heretykes
scysmatikes / and Ar^yens / As to them that were enmyes and adversaries of the
faith of god And if of their se^te came in to the mountain / He made them to
be chacyd thens saying / That they were werse thanne the serpents of the
deserte /

Also the company of light / that is to say of Christian men / ought not to be
accompanied with derkenesse. that is to wit with Heretykes and Infydelis / A
woman came on a time to him / Requyrynge him that he would pray to god for her
daughter / which was traueylled with a devil / And In contynent that he had
made to god his prayer / the devil left her daughter peasybly / A another time
came to him two Philosophers on high on the mountain / The which by subtle
dysputacyons supposyd to have overcome him and dysceyued / When he saw them.
he Judged them to be Paynemes. and said to them / I wonder of you that been
so wise how ye come to me from so far / for to see a man folysshe / To whom
they ansuerde that he was no fool / but he was right wise / Saint Anthonye
ansuered to them that he was a fool / by that they had lost their labor and
way / And if it so be that I be wise like as ye say / And for to love wysdom
it is vtylyte and prouffyte / Follow ye that ye allow and praise And so ye
shall do your duete / For thoose men ben to be praised when they ensyewe the
good and wyle men / If I had goon to you. I would have followed your law /
Then sith ye ben come to me. Come and follow my faith and be ye crystenyd /
Then^e the Philosophers went their way /

Other came to him in mocking him by cause he was no clerk ne lettred / To
whom he asked the which had be first or the wit. or the scripture / And if
the scryptures were by the wit and understanding / Or if the wit and
understanding came of the scriptures / They ansuered him^ that all the
scryptures proceeded and were made by the understanding / Then said saint
Anthonye / He that has understanding good and hoole. nedyth not to be lettred
by scryptures / And in this manner he delivered them all confused /

Constantyn the Emperor and his two sons. Constante and Constanciyus wrote to
him on a time in salewynge him. To the end that it might playse him to write
some thing to them for their comfort and consolaco^n Saint Anthonye seenge
ye lettres was not abashed / ne changed no thing for the salutacyon of so
great lords / But as Inmobyle and canstaunt. not willing to behold the said
lettres. called to him all his brethern. and after said to them / The kings
of this world send to us lettres. which seems to be thing merueyllous. And
hereof we may be glad / For all men notwythstondyng they have diverse
dygnytees and lordshyppes ben borne and deye the one with that other / And
therefore we ought to honor the scryptures and lettres pryncypally such as
god has written to men / as ben the commandments of the law / And by cause
there is none conuenyence among kings and Relygyouses / I woll not take the
lettres that the kings send to us / For I know not the science and manner to
salewe them be lettres / In the end the brethern prayed him that he would
write again to the said ky^ges / In admonestyng them to flee the vices. and
to ensiewe the virtues / And so he wrote to them in this manner /

Ye kings I counseylle you that ye keep the Christian law / But I pray you /
Wene ye not that your puyssaunce temporell be great / For that is but a little
thing to the regard of the puyssaunce of god / And therefore ye ought not to
be proud / Esteem of yourselfe. that ye be no thing more thanne other / For
as soon and as well shall ye be Iuged of god. as the most poor of the world
/ With this I pray you yt ye ben pyteuous and debonayr toward your subgettes /
Having cure and business to do Justice as well to the poor as the rich /
Consydre ye that there is a king above you eternal. not oonly upon you but
upon al mankind Thise lettres seen by the said princes tofore named. they were
greatly comforted. And the fame and reno^mee of saint Anthonye was over all the
country publysshed and known /

After that the Paynems and Gentyles were confused of their arguments And the
kings comforted by his lettres / He returned in to the mountain / in which
he had many vysyons / by yt which he knew and by reuelaco^n all that was done
in Egypt / And sent to the bysshopp of Egypt. named Serapyon / Emonge the
which he saw a much pyetable caas / and worthy of sorowfulnes / which was
this / He being with his brethern set / lift his eyes up to heaven
wayllynge and weeping / And a little while after that he had seen the
reuelaco^n. which was showed to him / He set him on his knees. prayenge to
god that it should not come ne happen / And so doing he shed out great
teeres in merueyllous habundance and plentee / Wherefore ye brethern that were
there present trembled and quoke / And questyned him what reuelacyon he hadd
had / Ha haa my children said saint Anthonye / The faith of cristendom shall
in short time be subverted / The men semblable or like to beestes / Iumentes
or fools / Which shall destroy the gods of the church / I have seen the
altar of our lord enuyronned or closed with mulettes / The which with their
fete have broken the altar / And these things ben cause of my wayllynge / Two
years after was publysshed and showed the cursed sect of the Heretykes Arryens
/ The chyrches were pylled / And the sacred vessellis vilypended or despised
with the Sacraments of the church / by the pollute or defoylled hondes of the
Ethnycyens and Iu^ydelis / And Paynems did and made in Alexandrye sacrefyces
to ydollis / made with their hundes / In making to them adoracyon and prayer.
as to their gods / in offrynge to them bows of palms / which ben in the
said country a right great ydolatrie / And the Christian men were constrained
to dod in like wise such Insolences with the A^yens / In such wise that there
was no dyfference between the one and the other / The courage said said
Anthonye should have abhomynacyon and horror to rehearse the horrible and
detestable sins that were done / Is it not a thing well abhomynable before
god. that ye vyrgynes and matrones were shamed and vylonyed / and were not
ashamed to lose their vyrgynyte / The blood of christian people was by cruel
occysion shed within the chyrches / In such wise that the aulters were all
deyed and sprynkcled with the blood /

A little while after this heavy and desolate Reuelacyon. saint Anthonye had a
another Reuelacyon right Joyous / Of which he comforted his Relygyous saying /
My children be not sorrowful / For after this persecucyon of the church of god
/ The christian people shall be releuyd / And the church shall be brought hoole
in his honor / And all they that shall keep well the faith. in this
persecucyon. shall be tofore god more shynynge than^e the bryghtnesse of the
son / False satellytees persecutours of ye faith of god shall be chacyd a
way / And Relygyon shall be encreacyd and augmented / And therefore my brethen
and friends take to you and have strong and great faith / to the end that ye
be in any wise subverted / For their doctrine is not of the appostle / But of
the devil semblable or like to Iumentis or fools and bente beestes / So many
Reuelacyons were showed and made to saint Anthonye / And so many men
guarysshed and heelyd by his prayers / that with great dyffycultee may not well
be put in writynge / And therefore we ought well to consydre the great faith
that he had to god / When he suffered by him so great quantytee of miracles
to be made / It is wreton if we have ferme faith and we say to one mountain
That he depart and moeue out of his place / It should remoeue and do it /

No thing is to us Impossyble. as far as we demand or ask things
lawful and helthful / Never for any prayer was it of duke or any prince Saint
Anthonye abode not long out of his monastery / And he said to his
Relygyouses / That like as fysshes upon the dry earth. anon deyen Right so
the Relygyouses by long abydyng with the Seculers. anon shall be deed by
dedely sin Saint Anthonye wrote to Balencuis Heretyke Arryan / the which was
governor of the country of Egypt under Nestor / that he should not trowble
ne vex the Christian people. But to cease of his tyranny / Balancuis despised
his lettres / And did many oultrages to the messager / And with that he
commanded that he and his Relygyouses should receive his dyscyplyne / Anon
after he being with the said Nestor in the pryncypall town of Alexandrye.
called Cher^um. An horse the most mekest of all the other / And upon which
the laid Nestor. which was lord of Egypt rode most upon. smote the said
Balancius down to the ground / and ete his thyghe / And three days after he
deyed. Whereof all they of Alexandrye were admerueylled / And said that it was
by cause he had despised ye enseynementes and techinges of saint Anthonye Some
other knights came to him / the which he admonested to leave the honor of
the world / And that they should goo well far for to get blessydnesse and
honor eternal which never shall have end /

He counseylled the Judge / that for love ne hate they should nor Judge / But
they should have always the dread of god tofore their eyes / In consyderyng the
common Proverb / Such Judgment as they Judge. Like Judgment should they have /
Then who that shall Judge ryghtfully after Justice / He shall have the reward
of Justice /

Saint Anthonye after that he had lived an hundred and five years. showed his
death to his Relygyouses / Which were therefore so heavy and sorry that they
began to weep in kissing him and enbracynge by great charytee / And after he
began to inform them with many eseynementes and doctrynes / And emonge all
other / that they should not be ennoyed ne greuyd to have begone the estate of
Relygion / But always should be constaunte. and persevere in virtues / Secondly
he said to them that they should have always in their entendement and
remembrance the hour of death / For by that they should dysspyse the world /
Thyrdly when they should see the Arryens persecute ye church / Like as it
has be showed by Reuelaco^n / That they should have sted fast faith. in
following always the tradycyon and life of holy faders /

After he returned in to a place solytary with one his friend / And took leave
of his Relygyouses. in salewynge them and gyuynge his benedyccyon /

And it is to wit that he deyed not in Egypt / Where as was the custom to
burye ye deed bodies in clothes of noble martyrs and other persons. without to
put their bodies in therth Of which custom saint Anthonye hadd often repreuyd
the bishops of the country / To the end that they should correct their
subgettis. In saying to them / That our lord had be buried unto the third
day in a Tomb closed / For which saint Anthonye dredinge that they would not
so do to him would not deye in the said country of Egypt / He seenge the
hour of his death to be nyghe / He called two of his Relygyouses. and said to
them / My children / God has late boden me to come to him / Wherefore I goo
the way that owe to goo / That is to the death / It is long time sith I
desired to see the heavenly things. I reco^mende me to your prayers / After he
admonested them in this manner / Know ye the estate that ye have taken / Ye
have seen many temptacyons of the devil / And they may be overcome /

Desire ye always to be with Ihesu Christ. Remember ye of mine admonycyons and
doctrines / And flee ye the cursyd Heretykes / For they ben enmyes of Ihesu
Criste / Besye ye yourself to keep the commandments of god

And see ye well to if ye love me that my body be not borne in to Egypt to the
end that it be not kept vaynly in honor / For. for this cause I am to men
to deye with you / But ye shall couere my body so pryuely in the earth / that
none know my sepulture but ye oonly /

After he made his Testament and ordenaunce of his last will / By the which
he left to saint Athanase bisshopp a vestyment of heir named Melote / which
couuered him from the sholders unto his thyes / Upon the which he had often
times lain with a mantel. in manner of a sclauynt / the which the said bishop
hadd given to him all new / Serapyon a another bishop had that other vestyment
like to the other / And the brethern Relygyouses had the heir / His Testamente
accomplysshed he said to them / Fare well my friends / Anthonye gooth his
way / He shall be no longer with you in this world / And these words said /
all his brethern Relygyous being there present. And weeping bytterly for the
occasyon that they saw his death so nigh kyssed him / And Incontinent he
rendered his spyryte to god / The aungellis that were there received it singyng
me lodyously / And notwythstondynge that ever he had frequented or vsyd by
the space of an hundred year. or there abowtes the deserts / And never had be
bayned ne washed / And that he had not ete any delycate metes / Yet
nevertheless his flesh and skyn^e was as precious and as fair / and more
clean than^e any might be seen /

By the ensample of him ye see how god enhaceth them. which deuowtly serve
him / Notwythstondynge that he hadd dwelled in deserte His fame and renommee
was so great in Yytalye. in Spayn and in France. that none was like / And in
him has be verefyed the word of our blessed Savior and Redemer Ihesu Criste
/ Saying that he that mekyth him. shall be exalted / As he has be thorugh
all the world / In which in diverse parties and regyons ben yet done
miracles without nombre. to the praysynge and exaltacyon of his glorious name
/ As well upon the bodies of mankind / As upon the brute beestes and
unreasonable / In such wise. that emonge all the other glorious saints / He
is right devoutly adoured and prayed unto /

Let us then pray him deuowtly that it playse him to pray to god for us
miserable synnars / to that that his worthy playsure be to give us ferme and
constaunt will and affection. to despise by his ensample this present world in
such manner / that fynably we may obtain the reame of heaven /

Thus endyth the life of the blessed saint Anthonye. And after folowyth ye life
of saint Hylaryon Heremyte / And begynnyth in latin Hilarion ortus Caplm.xxvii.


Saint Hylaryon was borne in the country of Palestyne. in a town named
Thabatha five mile fro a cite called Gasa. or there abowtes / He was as a Rose
flourysshynge emonge the thorns / For his fader was a Paynem and served
thydollis / But Hylaryon served god His fader sent him in to Alexandrye. for
to learn the science of Gramaire / In the which he was suffysauntly Instruct
after his young aege / But that more is of valewe he learned the very science of
the faith of Christ / For he byleuyd in Ihesu Christ / He being a scoler
fled all vices and sins. despysyng generally all the vanytees of the
world / And occupied himself oonly to serve god and holy church / Whan^e he
herd the reno^mee of saint Anthonye / which was strongely spradde in all
Egypt / He went to see him / And he being there arrived / changed his
habyte / And was there.ij. months with him in contemplaco^n. and Ioyeng the
great humylytee of saint Anthonye /

And as he received humaynly ye brethern that would be Relygyous with him / In
like wise as he was himself hard and sharp to correct them. and so he was
ready to admonest them

He was sobre in metes / And he was never syke for what someuer abstynence he
did / When the holy fader Hylaryon had seen his holy conuersacyon / He
returned with some Relygyouses in to the house of his fader / Whom he found
and his nyece also deed and departed out of this world / And in contynent as
towched of the holy ghoste^ he distrybuted his part of their gods to poor
folk / and reserved no thing for himself / In considering the scripture
that says / That he which renoucyth not all that he possessyth. may not be
dyscyple of Ihesu Christ And how well that he was not but fyftene years old /
Nevertheless he went all naked abowte seven miles far from the forsayde
cytee of Gaza in to a place full of thieves. And when his friends told him the
peril / to which he went to / He ansuered. that he that would eschew the
death perdurable ought to despise the death naturell /

All men merueylled of his life. con / syderynge his aege / which was yet so
tender / And nevertheless endured somothe pain / His clothing was oonly of a
sack and a mantell of pellycon. which saint Anthonye had given to him / The
devil seenge the lyffe of this child. by cause he might not call him again
to the world / Tormented him strongly. to the end to overcome him. and bring
him under his rule / He beat him with fystes on his breast saying to him /
Little Ass I shall well keep the from gooynge back / Thou shalt not have
oonly barley breed for to ete / but shall deye for hu^gre and thirst / In
Somer I shall make the to have cold / And I shall put the in such astate that
thou shalt not remember but for to ete and drink. without to think on god /

The holy child ete not in three or four days. but a lityll herbs and fygges
Yet for to augmente and encreace his penance in fasting he labored the earth
/ And made fyscellis wouen with Read and Ionkes / In considering that he that
takyth no pain to labor is not worthy to ete /

On a night he herd many diverse voices. like the voices of a child / the
bletynge of sheep / the lowynge of oxen the clamor of wymmen. the cry of
lions and many other diverse voices /

And all this did the devil which supposed to have brought him out of his
wit by the feere of the herynge / And after by his eyes / And he anon knelyd
down. and markyd his forhede with the sign of the Cross / And after he lokyd
on that one side and that other / wenynge to have seen the beestes and the
other things / Whereof he had herd the voys / And Incontinent he saw them in
a carte which horses drew rennynge as they had been wood / Then he began^e
to cry and call the name of Ihesu / And anon the earth opened / And all the
company so cryenge and howlynge sonke down in to the pytte of hell / Then
began he to say these words wreten in the Cantycle of the cursyd Pharao.
which says thus / The horse and the man that was upon him / God has thrown
them in the sea / The deuylles goon in the likeness of horse and chariottes /
But we shall be borne in ye name of our lord / The enmyes of hell enuyous of
our Redempcyon present to us so many of diverse and cursyd temptacyons / that
with great pain it is possible to recyte them / Often times when the
blessed child Hylary on slepte / The devil in likeness of a woman all naked
showed him to him When he ete he presented to him the remembrance of diverse
metes /

Some time when he was in prayer he passed before him like a wulffe howlynge
/ A another time like a fox / A another time like a bataylle of men armed. In
such wise that one let him self fall tofore him. in demaundyng him
sepulture / On a time as he lay flat upon the ground. making his prayers
to god / came the devil behind him / Which smote him on the heles. and on
the back. and on the heed saying / Arise thou Hylaryon / Wherefore slepest
thou / But not for all yt he moeuyd him no thing / He was so much
rauysshyd in his prayers /

From that time as he was syxtene years old. he withdrewe him in to a little
house made of Ionkes and bows Wherein he endured till he was twenty years old.
cold and heete. Rain. and snow. and other great necessytees / And after he
dwelled in a another little houses^ which was four foot broad and five foot
high / But it was a little longer thanne his body / This little house seemed
better a sepulcre than an house / He clipped of his heeres ones a year / That
is to wit tofore the solempnytee of Ester / He lay bare upon a bed of
Ionkes / and so continued to the death / And never was he covered but with one
sack / The which he never washed / Saying that in an hayer ought not to be
sought clennesse / He never changed Robe ne cote. till tholde was rotyn / His
felycytee was to remember holy scripture / And emonge his orysons he song
deuowte psalms to god as he had be present /

After that he was.xxi. years old. unto.xxvi. he lived sobrely / And in three
year he ete not but only a syxter of wortes meddled in a little cold water /
In the other three years he ete but breed and salt with a little water / After
seven and twenty years till five and thyrty. he ete not but six ounces of barley
breed And for his potage a little cool wortes without oil. But when he saw
his body by straytnesse of lyffe became scabby and ronyous / Alytyll for to
recomforte himself / he putt a little oylle in his potage And he lived in this
life sobrely unto tha^ge of three and forty / without etynge apples ne other
fruits / When he came unto the aege of three score and four year. and the
death drawing nyghe^ He ete no more bread till he was four score year old.

All that he ete and drank weyed not all but five vncis / And thus fynysshed

yet ben not well content / And he that ete not but oonly when at the son
was gone down one time on ye day / And all his mete and drink weyed not but
five ounces / Yet he lived unto the aege of four score years / Let us then
be sobre. unto the end to be chaste by the ensample of the good holy fader
Hylaryon. which in his lyffe would suffer. and endure so much evil and
pain / for the honor of Ihesu Christ /

He being in the aege of.xviij. years Thieves came to him. wenynge to affraye
him by cause of his young aege. Or for to rob some thing fro him / And how
well they made great dylygence to find his little house. Nevertheless they
went round abowte it an hoole day and a night. and cowde not find it / And
on the morn they fond it and him therein / And they demanded of him this
questyon / If the thieves came to the. what sholdest thou do thou little man /
He ansuered to them What may they demand or ask. seen that I am all naked.
and have none moeuable goods / Then they said to him / Thou myghtest be
slain / The child ansuered / I may well be slain truly / But for that I
drede-not / For I am ready for to deye / The thieves were much admerueylled. And
recounted to him how they had sought him / And after they amended their lines
He was not yet but two and twenty years old / when his fame and renommee
sprange over all the country of Palestyne. by cause of the holiness of his
lyffe / And in that time was a woman in the town of Lent^opolytane. whom her
husbonde dispysed and had in hate / By cause he cowde not conne have of her
in fyftene years any child / Wherefore she came to saint Helaryon demanding
or aryng counseylle of him how she might do And by cause that at the first
time he would not speak to her. but spytte. by cause he would not speak /
Then she fell down on her knees. saying to hy^ Fader Hylaryon let it
playse the to here me / and torn not away thine eyes from me / But behold me
not as a woman but as one unhappy and cursyd

At last he spoke to her. in demaundyng her the cause of her sorrow / The
which by her recyted and opened / saint Hilaryon said to her. that she should
goo home and have always steadfast hope in god / And after for the py^e that he
had in her. he prayed god often times in great habundau^ce of teeres. so
effectuously that in the end of the year. she had a child / and that was his
first miracle /

The wife of one named Elypydius coming to se saint Anthony. abode in the
town of Gaza. with threof her chyldern and her husbonde / In which town
deyed the said three children The mother being in the myddle of them three so
desolate. that she wyste not whom most to bewaylle /

And aduysed her of saint Hylaryon which was nyghe by / And took the way
with her Chamberers. and left all her astate for to come to the place where
he was To whom she said. I require and adjure the in the name of our lord
Ihesu Christ / Of his glorious passion. and of the effusyon of his precious
blood. yt it playse the to pray for my three children. that they may by him be
raised from death / To the end that his name be praised and magnyfyed in the
cite of Paynems / And also I adjure the in like wise yt for this cause thou
come out of thine Hermytage. And come in to the cite of Gaza Then ansuered
saint Hylaryon. that he would never come out of his celle / ne also would
entree in to towns ne citees. She no thing content of his ansuere fell down
prostrate or flatt to the ground. and began to cry / Hylaryon reyse my
children by thy prayers / the which saint Anthonye has so long kept and
governed in Egipte / To the end that of the they should be kept in Syrye /
All they that were then present wept / And how well he dyfferred his
gooynge / nevertheless she said to him: that she should never depart / But he
should first promise to goo vysyte her children with her / And so he was
constrained by her words for to goo thither / He being comen thither / And
seenge the children all cold. as they which had no sign of life / In the
presence of great multitude of people thither comen. by cause of him / He made
his prayer deuowtly to god / The which made the said children cast out
great habundaunce of water out of their bodies / And after knew their fader
and mother / and thanked humbly the good fader Hylaryon / And began to drink
and ete / like as they had had never greyt^ ne had lost the lyffe / This
miracle was so spradde. and renommed openly in all the country of Egypt and
Syrye / In such wise manyfested or known that the people came to him from all
parties / Of whom many went in to Relygyon for to lead solytary life /

A woman named Fatydya borne of the cytee of Rynocorne in the country of
Egypt. which had be blind by the space of ten year / came to him in saying
that she had dyspended all her hauour to leches for to recouure her syghte /
The holy man said to her If thou had given for goddys sake that which
thou haste given to Fisicyens and Leches. thou sholdest much sooner have
recovered thy syghte /

For god should have given it to the again / Nevertheless she began to cry
mercy / And anon by his prayers her syghte was restored to her /

There was a man in his time named Messicas born in Iherusalem. the which was
stronger thanne any other of that countreye / For by his bodyly strength he
bare also great a burden or more thanne an Ass / And ye burden that he bare
was estemyd or thought at fiftene Muys of the mesure of that country the
burden that he bare / It happed by the suffraunce of god that he was possessyd
of a devil / And became enraged and mad / In such wise that he must be
bound with chains by the strength of many men / and yet cowde they not hold
him so much for his strength and gretnesse. that for the vyolence of the
devil which tormented him that he by extreme woodnesse rented of their noses
and other members. When he was brought to the church. he foomed at mouth
and tormentrd himself as a wood bole His parents and kynnesmen. to the end
that he might recover health they brought him to this holy man Hylaryon / And
thus as they were tofore this holy man. where as his brethern trembled for
dread of his merueyllous gretnesse and woodnesse / The good holy fader
commanded to unbind him And that no man should be aferde of him / So it was
done / And myraculously there where tofore he might not behold / He became so
soft that swetly he kyssed the fete of the said saint Hylaryon / And the
seventh day after he was all hoole and guarysshed /

A another named Oryon the most Rich and chyef in auctoryte of the cytee of
Achylle by unto the Reed see / was also in like wise tourmented of a legyon of
deuyllis / Wherefore he was strongly bounden with chains by all the members of
his body / Thus as saint Hylaryon went with his brethern / The same Demonyak
with his two hondes bounden with yren took him. and lift him up all on
high from the earth / Whereof the people being present began to cry /
Doubting that some Inconuenyent might come to him / By cause he was much
feblyd and week by fasting and straytnesse of life / But the holy man began
to laughe and strain the hondes of the seek man / Whom he held so subget.
that he might not grieve ne enoye him / And after by adiuracyons he moeued the
deuylles that were within his body / In such wise that by the mouth of the
seek man^ the people herd horrible and diverse voices cryenge and howlynge.
like strange beestes / And after the seek man began to cry / O good Ihesus
unbind me that am thus poor and so meschaunt. and unhappy / And I shall say
things which were never herd /

Anon he was all hoole and guarysshed / And a little time after he and his
wife put theymself to goo unto the monastery of saint Hylaryon. in than king
him / And in offrynge to him great gifts and tresours for the health that he
had recovered by his merytes / To whom the good fader saint Hylaryon said /
Haste not thou radde what Giezey and Simon magus suffered some time / Giezey
sold the health made to Naban by his master Helisee / And Simon would have
give much money to saint Peter for to have hadd power to give the grace of the
holy ghost / Then Oryon all we pynge said to him / Fair fader take that I
offer to the / And give it to poor people / And Hylaryon ansueryd / Thou shall
distrybute and deal it better thanne I / For thou ghost thorugh the cytees.
and know better them yt ben poor thanne I do / It should not be a thing
propre ne well besemynge. that I that have renouncyd all temporell things.
should take the goods of a another / Oryon fell down to the ground prostrate
and flat. and began to weep for the dysplaysaunce yt he had of that. that
saint Hylaryon would not receive his offer / But saint Hylaryon comforted him
saying. My sone and friend be not wroth for that I have refusyd thy money /
It is for thy prouffyte and mine / For if I took it I should offend god / Thou
shall be yet tormented of the deuylles. which shall reentre in to thy body /
But thou shall take it in pacyence / And in so doing their torment shall be
to the helthfull. Wherefore content thyself. and be from hens forth good and
Just /

A Massonne named Zazanus in hewynge stones was taken with a paleseye / And by
his servants was brought to saint Hylaryon / And anon was ^eelyd and
guarysshed /

A young man amorous of the daughter of his neighbor. which was vyrgyne / The
which by no wise of atowchynge. ne otherwise cowde deceive her / And desyryng
to accomplyssh his Inordynate will on her. went to a cytee named Memphyn for
to inquire and wit of a Magycyen dwelling there. how by art Magyqne he might
deceive the said maiden / And for to bring this abowte he was a year under
Esculapius Magycyen / By the moyen of whom were souls without nombre dampened /
Fynably this young man after the Instruccyon of the said Magycyen went to the
houses of the said vyrgyne / And put under the celle or enter of the yate
certain images of Coper. saying certain words of the devil. which he
byleued should serve to his caas / And forth with the said maid became all
folysshe / And by great woodnesse she took of her keuerchyef of her heed. and
drew her here /

Straynyng her teeth. and calling the said young man / She was brought to
the holy man / In the presence of whom. Incontinent the devil whom she hadd in
her body began to cry and howl / In declarynge how by force and art Magyke
he was entered in to her / After that he hadh said these words / he said to
saint Hylaryon / Wherefore co^maundest thou Hylaryon to me that I should goo
hens and depart /

Know thou not well that I am holden under the zelle and entree of the house
of the maid / And I am by art magyke bounden with chains / and may not
depart / but if the young man that louyth her^ which by his art has bound
me. vnbindeth and leteth me goo The holy man said to him / Thy force is not
great. sith that thou art bounden with so little bonds / Say to me false
enmye how thou art so hardy to entree within the body of this virgyne / The
devil ansuered. to the end that I would keep her a vyrgyne /

How said saint Hylaryon. Say thou thyselfe Conseruatour of vyrgynyte. And
thou art traytoure to chastyte Now say to me wherefore haste not thou entered in
the bodi of the young fool amerouse. The devil ansuered. By cause that an
other devil my fellow named the devil of love is there These words said
saint Hylaryon commanded the devil to void out of the body of the said
maid / The which Incontinent and by euydente miracle was heelyd and
guarysshyd /

After this saint Hylaryon repreuyd the young man of that he had given sign
of love to the young maid / By the which he deseruyd to be possessyd of the
devil /

A another named Candydalus. yt which was Judge under the emperor Constantyne
of ye Prouynce of Germanye / The which after the historyes stondeth between
the countries of Saxonne and of Almayne / And was brought to saint Hylaryon in
to the cite of Gaza in Syrye. for to be delivered from the puyssaunce of the
devil. of which he was tormented every night / And Incontinent as he was
tofore saint Hylaryon he was hoole and guarysshed / This was a thing well
merueyllouse. how in so far country was known his renommee / That is to
wit in Syrye. Palestyne. Egypt. and Germanye / When the said Candydalus
was heelyd / He would have given to saint Hylaryon ten pound of goloe / But he
took but oonly a loof of barley / Considery^ge that who someuer should be
nourysshed of such mete. should consydre gold and silver for dounge and
ordure / The holy man heelyd not oonly the beestes reasonable / But also brute
beestes /

A merueyllous great Camel / ye which had slain many persons / And in the
end he was take by thyrty men which brought him bounden to saint Hylaryon /
His eyes were reed as fire. and scumed in such wise. that men were greatly
aferde to beholde^ him But the holy man commanded him Incontinent. that he
should be loosed and let goon / And anon they that were there fled much
far from the Camel / Except one that abode by hy^ Then^e he began to say
to the devil that was within the Camel / O dampened devil. thou make me no
thing aferde / For somoche as t you art in a great beeste / For thou art as
mighty in a little Fo^e. as thou art in a great Camel / After he laid his
hand tofore the said Camel / which came all wood and enraged / And anon
he bowed his heed unto the earth /

Whereof each man was abashed. how in so little while the said beeste so
enraged or wood was become so mylde and came /

In effect saint Iherom says that he would not write all the deeds of saint
Hylaryon / For the time should not be short / As he would say that they were
Innumerable When some of Syry^ came to saint Anthonye he said to them /
Wherefore come ye fro so far / Have ye not my sone Hylaryon with you / The
which shall aid and help you by his prayers /

In the name of the same Hylaryon in Palestyne were many chyrches made His
humylytee was merueyllouse great. And for in the same and in all other virtues
to give and show good ensample to the holy and deuowte Relygyouses / Often
times he went to visyte them in their hermytages / The which knowing his
great virtues followed him well often in so great nombre. that they were often
times with him nighe by a two thousand men / Thus as the holy man went
vysytyng the deserts of Cades / He came in to Heluse a cytee. where all the
people were assembled for to do sacrefyce to the Temple of Venus / In that
Temple were many Paynems / The which had been delivered of the devil by the
Intercession and prayer of the holy man Hylarion / And when they apperceyued
him to pass tofore ye temple aforsayde. They and their wives sprange out of
the Temple / and said to him in langage Syryaque / Bareth / Which is as much
to say as give benedyccyon to them that prayen the / Mekely he herd them /
And prayenge them that they should not adoure him by prayers / but one god
oonly eternell / Merueyllous grace of god happed to them / For by his coming
and by his prayers they were in such wise enspyred that from that hour they
made them Christian. And held him for their Bysshopp /

A another time as he would depart for to goo vysyte the Relygyouses to him
subgettes / He sent his lettres to some Relygyouses in to lodgys. in which he
would lodge / And among the brethern there was one. which was merueyllously
scarce and nygardouse / And would no thing give / Wherefore the other prayed
to the holy man. that he would lodge in his hermi^age^ to the end to correct
this cursyd vice /

He ansuered to them / What would ye should be done to him / He should
sklaunder us / And we should but traueylle him / Ten days after the
Relygyouses had knoulege. that the holy man should pass by his vineyard /
Sent kepars in to the vineyard / In commaundynge them that if any would
entree in to it / That they should cast stones at them / The holy man this
seenge and knowing what there should come thereof. began to laughe at the
folly of the said Relygyous / And went in to the house of a another much
lyberall. named Sabbas / The which by cause it was Sunday / desired them al
to goo ete of the grapes and raysons in his vineyard / And that they should
take their refeccyons / But saint Hylaryon let them to so do Saying
cursyd be he of us that eteth tofore that he has had refeccyon spirytuell /
Let us serve god first. And after ye shall goo in to the vineyard And so
they dyden /

Now was three thousand that entered in to the vineyard / And after that they
had eten after their appetytes / there was then estemyd fruit enough for to
gadre an hundred mues. or tonnes of wine / But twenty days after. the lyberall
relygyouses gadred there three hundred / And that other that was skarce and
nygardous gadred not half so much / And yet what he had gadred. it turned
in to vynaygre / And so lost it /

Saint Hylaryon then repreuyd all Relygyouses that were curyous of things
transytorye /

In like wise a another Relygyous auarycyous dwelling nyghe by the space of
five miles to saint Hylaryon had a little gardyne / Which he caused a man to
keep This Auaricious man. for to take the benyuolence or good favor of the
holy man. came often to vysyte the brethern / And pryncypally one named Esicius.
To the end to have habytude and famylyertee with the said saint Hylaryon /
And brought on a day emonge other things grene cooles. which he had gadred
in his gardyne / And delivered them to the said Esicius / The which
presented them to the holy man Hylaryon being at table / And when he saw
them / Incontinent he commanded that they should be taken away Saying that
they were so stynkyng that he might not feel the sauoure /

And after demanded or asked who had brought them thither Esicius named to
him the brother / Smelle ye not them said the holy man / how auaryce is roted
in these cooles / If the beestes had them tofore them. they would not ete
them / Anon Esicius bare them to the oxen and kyen / which would not ete
them / The holy man had this grace / When oonly he saw the vestymentes of a
man. Or that he had towched it / He knew what sin that man had commysed /

When he was.lxiij. year old in conte^plynge the multitude of bredern yt were
come to him in desert and also that by him Infynyte seek men were heelyd and
guarysshed / He began to weep saying to his brethern / Alas my brethern I have
well lost my reward. I supposyd to have Renounced and forsaken the world /
and I am returned. consyderyd the multitude of you that be with me. For I
ought to be allone in a pytte or fosse for to do penance / And to live
solytaryly / In this lamentacyon he was by the space of two years / The which
passed / he had Reuelacyon of the death of saint Anthonye. The which death he
showed to the good woman of Arystene / Of whom here above is made mencyon / And
that it was true / Two days after the said Reuelacyon came messagers. which
wytnessyd the said dethe^ Which happed at the hour that he had showed it
to the said woman / His life was so holy. that every man merueylled / As well
for reason of his miracles. As of his abstynences / Science. and humylytee /
Bishops. Priests. Clerks Relygyouses^ Matrones. and other Christian people /
As well nobles as other in great multitude went to him / And held theymself
well happy / when they had of the breed and of the ^ylle that he had
blessed with his hand / By cause and above all things he desired solytude /
And had appetyte to be allone /

On a time he purposyd to leave his hermytage. and to goo few from his brethern
And he declared to some of them / The which according to his will. and to
the end that more art his case he might pass by the feldes. brought to him
an ass for to bear him / But with great pain might he sytte on him / by
cause of his debylite and of the great abstynences that he made /

And when he began to pass by the deserts of Palestine moo than ten
thousand persons enforcyd them to have supposed to tarry him / yt he should
not goo / But nevertheless they cowde not let ne tarry him / And in smytyng
against the ground with his staff said for to content them / I know well
that my god is no liar / Also I may not see for to destroy ye chyrches ne to
shede the blood of my chyldern Al they that there were present knew by his
word. that he had had some reuelacyon^ which he would not show But always they
would have tarried hy^ Then he said to them that he would never ete till they
would let him goo Seven days after he took his lene of his brethern. In
commaundynge them that they should return in to their monasteryes / And after
he went in to Bethirion / Five days after he came in to Pelusus. and there
vysyted all the brethern dwelling in Lychone /

And three days following he went in to a place named Thobaston. for to see
Dracone bysshopp and Confessor The which had been sent thither in ^ryle /
When the said Bysshopp saw him / he was strongely comforted with his
presence /

Three other days after he went in to Babylone. for to see Phylon the bysshopp
/ These two bishops had be sent in to exyle by the king Constancyus. The
which gaaf favor and good will to the Arryens Heretykes. He departed from
thens. And two days following he came to the castle of Affrodyton / Where he
found Bysano deaken / the which had be accustomed to carry water upon
camellis and Dromedaryes in to deserte to saint Anthonye. By cause there was
none in the place where he abode / He recounted and showed to the said
Hylaryon how at hour that saint Anthonye should deye / it was commanded to
him. how he should wake all the night / Saint Hylaryon and the said Bysano
were by the space of three days walking by oyuerse places / And in the end
came in to an high mountain / Where they found two Relygyous men / That is
to wit Ysaac and Plusyano / his Ysaac had wreten the life of saint Anthonye /
The good holy man Hylaryon. went there from place to place / To the end to
vysyte ye places where saint Anthonye had conuersid and used. and prayed to
god. and had done other virtuous works / And in vysytynge those places. he
found a gardyne. In which saint Anthonye had planted and set many trees.
and also had made many piscynes for to water them when it was need /

He found also the place where he lay for to sleep / Which was no gretter
thanne the body of a person And after returned saint Hylaryon with two of his
brethern to the next hermytage / called Affrodyton / In which place saint
Anthonye lived a space of time. solytaryly / Now hadd it not rayned in that
land in three years / Like as the elements should have complained the death of
saint Anthonye / But at the Request of saint Hylaryon they hadd then great
habundance of Rain /

After the which a multitude of serpents and venymouse beestes roo^ up.
against the people / Of the Infeccion of whom they deyed in dyfferently without
remedy. if Incontinent they had not be brought to saint Hylaryon. which gaaf
them oil blessed. Of which anon as their wounds were touched were hole and
guarysshed / And by that cause that in those parties he was so much known /
And that there was done to him ouermoche great honor. He went in to
Alexandrye. and came in to a monasterye named Oason / Ferdermore by cause he
had not dwellid in no town walled sith he had be religyous He went to
Brynchion by Alexandrye with some of his brethern that he knew where he was
received benygnely / But anon after by cause that they saw the discyples of
the holy man make ready his ass for to depart / they prayed him with Joined
hondes that he would abide / For they hadd lever have deyed than he should
depart fro them Then the holy man for to comfort them. said that he was
constrained hastly to depart / To the end that by his ouerlonge taryenge there
with them. he should be cause of heaviness / Saying to them ferdermore that
for some things that they should see after come They should well know that not
with out great cause. he should not depart so hastily from them and their
monastery / And the day after it happed that the Pryncypall of the cite of Gaza
/ A cytee nyghe by wherein dwelled Paynems and enmyes to the law of our lord
Ihesu christ / Which were aduertysed of the coming of saint Hilaryon to the
said monastery / Knowing that their law was in way and danger to be all
destroyed by ye moyen of the said saint Hylaryon / And for to eschew the same
concluded to goo to the said monastery. for to put him to death / And so
Incontinent they went thither. And they finding that so hastily was departed
from thens / And without to be aduertysyd^ ne warned of their enterprise and
purpose / Imposed and put to him that he was a Magycyen / Saying emonge them
that yt they might clearly know. that he saw before things that comen after
/ Now it ought to be understand that when saint Hylaryon was departed from
Palestyne / They of Gaza demanded of Iulyan which then was emperor
license for to slay his discyple Esicius / And for more lyghter to take him /
they had wreton to all the lands there abowte His church was then
dystroyed and beten down / And his Relygyouses slain / The which thing he
had perceived by reuelacyon / wherefore he was departed. by cause he would not
see that dystruccyon / Like as tofore is said /

Saint Hylarion so departed from Bruchyon and the deserts retournyd in to
Oason / Where he was a year or there abowte. But by cause his renomee and fame
was through that land spradde^ He would goo to places where he should not be
know / And went for to pass over the sea / and to dwell in yles where he
should not be known

In that time Adryan which was his dyscyple coming from Palestyne arrived to
him. saying / That Iulyan the Emperor was slain / And that in his place
regued an Emperor that was Christian / When the holy man herd his purpoos.
he blamyd him / And nevertheless he would not return / But he and Zazanius
one his discyple went in to a ship for to come in to Cecyle / And when they
were in the myddill of the sea / the sone of the maronner was rauisshed of a
devil. Which entered in to his body And by cause that saint Hylaryon by force
of coniuracyon would have constrained him to depart out of the said sone. He
said to him. O servant of god why suffrest thou not me to be in peace within
the water / Give me spase to goo to the land / For if I depart here / I
should fall in to the abysme / The holy man ansuered to the deuylll. If my god
has given to the puyssaunce and power to abide / Abide thou. And if thou haste
no might. I shall cast the out / Anon after the child was hoole and
guarysshed / After this saint Hilaryon to the end that he should not be known
made the Maronners to swear. and other that were there. that they should not
show his name / And when he was arrived in an high mountayn in Cecyle named
Pachumum. he would have given to the Maronner for his solaire a book of the
gospellis. which he hadd do make in his yongthe for him and his dyscyple
Zazanius / The Maro^ner seenge that he had none other thing would no thing
have / And to the end that he would not there be known of the Merchants of the
Eest parties / He went far in to the myddyll of the land. well twenty mile
from the sea / And there in a desert he made of the broken bows and wode
fagottes. and brusshes / and charged and laid in the neck of his dyscyple for
to bear to the market in the next town / To the end that he should bring
breed for their sustentacyon /

Alas let us consydre the pouertee of this holy man / and how much evil he
suffered for to come to heaven / we that have so much good / How suppose we to
have it / I believe yt it shall be with great pain / And how well that the holy
man was goon in to a strange country. by cause he would not be known /
Nevertheless anon after by the moyen of his merueyllous werkes^ His fame was
great thorugh all the country of Cecylle / And the first knowledge of him was
by a a man. which had a devil within his body / the which man was brought
in to the church of saint Peter of Rome / And on a day among the other / the
devil cried by the mouth of the seek man. with in short time Hylaryon shall
enter in to Cecylle. the which wenyth to hyde him / But I shall goo to him.
and shall manyfeste and show him thorugh out the land of Cecylle / For such
is ye playsure of god / Anon the same man with his servants went to the sea. and came a land in Pachumium / And like as the devil brought him tofore
the hermytage of saint Hylaryon. And Incontinent was all hoole / The which
curacyon was the first miracle that he made in Cecylle / And after came to him
Innumerable seek people / Of whom he refusyd many great gifts which they
would have given to him / Considering by him that which our Savior said to
his dyscyples / I have given to you grace / without any thing to give
therefore. Give ye in like wise without taking of any thing /

Esicius dyscyple of saint Hylaryon sought him in diverse places / And was
there three year in deserts and mountains for to seche him / And fynably in a
cite named Mathone he found a Jew / the which said to him that there was
descended in to Cecylle a Prophet which did Infynyte miracles. In such wise
that he was reputed and taken for an holy Heremyte Esicins asked him of his
habyte. of his tongue / and of his aege / Whereof he cowde no thing say to
him / For he had not seen him / But he said so by heryng say / Esicius came
by adventure in to Pachumium in a vylage / In which he demanded and inquired
for the holy man / Whom every man told where he was / For he was known of
them all. for the great miracles that he did / Whereof they hadd great wonder
/ And never took any thing of them but a pyece of bread / Esicius by great
dylygence found him / And knelyd down tofore him / weeping and kissing his
fete / Saint Hylaryon took and releuyd him up / And a lytyl while after they
went in to a castle / named Epidarium in Dalmacye. where by in a field there
being. he dwelled a little time / But he was Incontinent known. As he before
had been in other places and countrees. where he had conuersyd and dwelled /

In the said place was a dragon merueyllously great / The which oonly
dystroyed not the goods. but also he devoured and slew the herd men that kept
beestes / Then the holy man caused to be brought a great heepe or stacke of
wood / And caused to be set fire therein / And after made his prayer to god.
The which made. the same dragon in the presence of all the people came and
burnt himself within the said fire /

In that same time. and anon after the death of Iulyan the Emperor all the
land trembled / And ye sees sprangen out of their places. In such wise that
it was supposyd that the world should perysshe. and be drowned by a second
deluge or flood / And ye ships were lift up to the mountains / And this
seenge the Epydanytayns. came for refuge and socoures to the holy man / And
brought him to ye ryuage or cooste of the sea / The which Incontinent after
that he had made three signs of the Cross in the sonde / Suddenly the sea
descended and became low / And came in to his usual custom / Here ought we
to note the words that our lord said to his Appostles / Which ben these /
If ye have very faith / And ye command to a moutayne. that it goo in to the sea Infallibly and without fayllynge it shall goo / Hylaryon did no less
miracle. When the sea that was in the parties so haunsed. that it covered
all the land / Incontinent was wythdrawen and becomen low / Of which
miracle all they of the cytee were admerueyled / But by cause that men began
to honor him there / He departed by night in a lytyl ^essell of the sea /
And two days after he fond a great ship which was laden / By the aid and
help of which he went in to Cypre / But so as they of the said ship would
have arrived and comen to an haven / The Marronners saw coming two ships
well garnysshed with men of Arms / Which men called Rouers of the sea /
Which enforcyd them to approach or to come aborde to them / In entenco^n to
rob and pylle them / Wherefore the Maronners and the dyscyples of saint
Hylaryon began to tremble and quake for feere / And the holy man did no
thing but laughe / And said to his dyscyples / Ye ben of little faith / These
thieves here which comen against us / ben not in so great multitude as was
Pharao / And nevertheless he and his company were drowned in the sea / And
when the ships of thieves were as nyghe as the cast of a stone / The holy
man said / Hola / Hola / Ye ben nyghe enough / And Inco^tynent happed a
merueyllous thing / For the ships of the said thieves returned bacwarde.
would the Paciones and Maronners or not /

After he entered in to a cite named Pafun being in Cypres a noble cytee and
much flowrysshynge in Poetrye / Of which the edefyces and buyldynges were
some time fallen down. because that the land trembled often /

There were much people tourmented of deuylles. which were within their
bodies / But the holy man had not ben there enhabyted twenty days but that
they cried with an high voys / Hylaryon the servant of Ihesu criste is in
this land / To whom we must all goo / In like wise there was in the cite of
Salomnocurium Laphyte / and many other which also cried saying / That they
must goo to the holy man Hylaryon / But they knew not where he was /

Thyrty days after or there about came to the holy man Hylaryon many seek men
/ unto the nombre of two hundred / Which were guarysshed and heelyd in eyghte
days /

He dwelled two years in that place there in abiding Esicius his dyscyple /
Whom he had sent in to Palestyne for to vysyte the brethern of the monastery
/ After that Esicius was come again to him / He returned in to Egypt. in to
a place named Botholya / By cause that there ne dwelled any Christian man / And
the place was so enhabytable / that uneath any man might goo there a foot /
And was dystaunte or being from the cite two miles or there abowte / There
were many trees and fair gardynes / But of fruit of them he never ete There
was also an old monastery. the which was all in Ruin or fallen in dekeye /
by the which was herd the ^oyses of some spirytes / Like as there had been a
great excercyse or Rowte of men of Arms / Whereof the holy man Hylaryon was
right Ioyeous / Considering the merit that he might get / in Resystynge and
wythstondynge the spyrytes that were so nygh him /

There dwelled he five years / Where few people went for to see him: for the
great asprete or sharpness of the place. And for the dyffycnltee or
doubfulnesse of the way to goo thither /

On a day the holy man Hylarion coming in to his gardyne apperceyuyd a man
Paralytyke^ or taken with the Palsy being tofore the gate /

Then Escius aryd him what he was / And who had brought him thither / He
ansuerd that he was the Procuroure of the town / to whom the gardyne in which
he was apperteyned unto / Then he took him by the hand and said to him / In
the name of god my friend arise thou and walk / A merueyllouse thing in
saying these words. the members of the seek man were restored in their
strength and health / In such wise that he went upon his fete / Of which
thing and miracle the fame sprange and spradde there all abowte / Wherefore
the holy man Hylaryon would no longer abide there / Not for to depart from
thens for any mutabylyte or chaungynge of thought / But by cause he desired to
live solytaryly. without to have knowledge of any person /

When he was four score years old. he felt himself much feeble / And by
cause that Esicius his dyscyple was then absente / He made a cedule or letter
of his hand / By the which he left to him all that he had / That is to
wit his Robe. Which was made of a sake / His Frocke. his Pelycon. and his
Gospellis / All these were no grete^ychesses /

Many deuowte Relygyouses of the cytee of Pafun. And with them a notable-woman
named Constance. at prayers of whom he hadd heeled her sone and her daughter /
Camen to him. by cause he was in dysposicyon to deyeed / And spoken with him as
he had To whom he required. and nevertheless commanded. that Incontinent as
he should be deed. They should putt him in to the earth in a gardine nyghe to
his house / And tofore that he deyed. there as he had no more charity he said
to his soul / What dredest thou my soul / Goo out of my body / Wherefore art
thou aferde / It is now gone three score and ten year. sith thou seruedeste
Ihesu Christ / And now thou dredest to deye / And thus saying he rendered his
spyryte to god / and Incontinent they buried hy^ within ye gardyne

Anon after his dyscyple Esicius which was in Palestyne knew his departing /
And then he came in to Cypre / And when he was in the gardyne where as he
was buried / He feigned that he would dwell there / To the end that they that
kept him should have no suspecyon ne mysdemyng that he would transporte and
carye away the body of saint Hylaryon / But he wroughte so pryuely. that ten
months after that he stele him a way. and transported or carried him to
Maxymian his auncyen and old church. in the which the same Esicius. and also
all the men and Relygyouses there abowte buried him in his frocke and his
pelycon / Which as it is said is there alhoole / And saint Hylaryon is yet as
he was in plain life / Gyuynge out odoures and savors merueyllously smelling
sweet /

The good woman Constaunce / which had be acustomyd in curyouse wakinges to
pass ye time in making her prayers. there as he had be burybe alive / When
she knew that he was transported and taken from thens She wynge the great love
that she had to him: Rendered and gaaf Incontinente her spyryte unto god / And
yet presently by this occasyon is there great questyon between them of Cypre
and of Palestyne / By cause they of Cypresayen. that they have the spirit /
And they of Palestyne sayen to have the body / Nevertheless in Cypre at this
day ben done to the praysynge of him moo miracles. thanne in Palestine /

And perauenture for almoche as he loved more the place Or by cause only that
it playsyth god that so it be done /

Thus ends this Prossesse of the right holy and deuowte man saint Hylaryon /
Here folowyth the life of saint Malachye / And begynnyth in latin Caromas /
Caplm.xxxviii.


CAromas is a cite in Syrie distaunt or being of fernesse fro Anthyoche abowte
thyrty mile / In the which dwelled Malachye. a man so named / Malachye is a
saying Syryaque / The which in latin tongue is asmoche to say. as king /
This same Malchus or Malachye was an holy man borne of Syrye. with him was always
an old woman. the which was so old. that she semyd always ready to deye They
two were so contynuelly in ye church that they might be lykenye to Zacharye
and Elysabeth in deuoco^n / Saint Iherom being in Syrye. some cyteyzyns of the
same cite, axed if the said Malachie. and same woman were married. or kynnes
folk / By cause he saw them so contynuelly togider / To whom was ansuered
that they were holy and devout persons toward god / Then saint Iherom
went to vysite the holy man for to demand and inquire of his life / The holy
man Malachyas said to him. that he was born of a place named Nyzibam / and
oonly Herytour of his fader and mother / The which for to continue their
lygnage. would have constrained him to take the Sacrament of Marriage / And
nothwythstondynge that he was by his fader strongly menaced and threrenyd / And
of his mother affectuously required for to marye him / Nevertheless he loved
beter to these the state of Relygyon. and to renounce and forsake the world /
After he said to him. that for doubt of the Romans that made watch upon the
passages. and of other men of the said country / He durst not goo in to the
Eeste / But went him in to the Weste He said to him also that he had be in an
Hermytage. which was named Calcid^s and stood toward the Southe between Mynas
and Heroas / And that he had found there good Relygyous under which werkynge
and laboring he had lived long time. After he was in will to return in to
his country / By cause that he wyste well that his fader was deed And for this
cause he would have the goods that were left for to give a part to poor
people / Another part to make a church. and the Resydue for to sustain his
life / The which thing he had declared to his Abbot as he said / And he
Incontinent blamyd him / saying yt it was temptacyon of the devil / And
alleged and showed to him for the same many fair hystoryes of some
Relygyouses. which in like caas hadd be deceived / For the denyll under the
color of good thing. temptyth always the person for to make him to
accomplysshe and do some evil /

He said ferdermore that his Abbott had said to him / That he resembled and
was like the hounde. the which after he hadd made his vomyte. Returned and
received it again / And for prayer that the Abbot cowde do. he would not
consent to abide How be it that he knelyd down on his knees tofore him /
Prayenge that he should not goo / but abide with him in prayenge and showing
that he that puts his hand to the plough^ That is to say that enters in
to Relygyon And he look backewarde / Is not worthy to have the kingdom of heaven
/

Alas said Malachye to saint Iherom. I was well melchaunte and unhappy /
When by his exhortacyons I would not abide with him / Which thing I would
not do / Wenyng that he said so for none other thing. but for to hold him
company / and for his right singular prouffyte / And to me departing and
taking of him leave. He said to me / Ha a my sone I ought well to be angry /
For I see the devil which markyth the with the sign of dampened men / And
like as ye sheep that lep^th out of the fold. is of the wulfe rauysshed /
Right so was I and my company / For in coming from Heroa for to goo in to
Edysle we were robbyd of thieves / And we were bitwene three score and four
score in a company / Emonge whom was taken a wife of one of my company / ^
And we were carried upon two camellys unto the house of a lord / And in going
thither we ete no thing but raw flesh. And drank milk of Camellis Finably
we arrived and came to the house of the said lord / Where I was constrained
for to save my poor lyffe to adoure him with his wife and his children / And
so dooynge I must knele down on my knees tofore them / And after for to
encreace my sorrows I was putt for to keep his sheep. The which I kept in
such wise that they multeplyed in great foyson /

There I ete no thing but soft chese and milk / But always I prayed to god
and said such psalms as I have learned. with the Religiouses that I had
left / The lord of whom I hadd kept the sheep for to reward me by cause
that I hadd kept them so well. would have constrained me to take in marriage
this woman. the whywhiche was prisoner with me / And by cause I would not take
her / But in excusing me I said that I was Christian and not she / and also
that her husbonde was yet living. which was prisoner with a another lord / He
drew out a sword. and would have slain me If Incontinent I had not promised
to espowse the same woman prisoner That night we were shytte both in a great
pytte / In which I said to myself / Alas what has it prouffyted to have
left fader and mother / and also my country / for to eschew marriage. if now I
marye myself / I suppose this aduersytee is comen to me because I have desired
to return in to my country Ha my soul what shall we do / Alas I shall slay
myself / It is better that I slay myself and be saved. thanne for to take a
wife in marriage and be dampened in hell euerlastyngly / After I had said thise
wodes I took a sword / And set the point against my stomach. In saying to
this said woman / O poor woman take me now martyr in marriage Otherwise shall
thou never have me to husbonde / Then the good woman prisoner knelyd down on
her knees tofore me / and began to cry / Ha my friend. I pray the in the
name of god slay not thyselfe / To the end that thy blood be not cause to lose
mine / O if thou wolt slay thyself / Slay thou me first / And so as Martyrs we
shall be married / I say to the for truth that when my husbonde shall be
frohens forth with me^ He shall never touch me / For from this hour forthon I
make a promise to keep Chastytee Wherefore then wolt thou slay thy self. if
thou take me in marriage / If it so were that thou woldeste have me otherwise /
I should rather slay myself thanne to consent to be thy wife /

But I pray the that thou take me as to thy wife / And I shall takethe as my
husbonde in clennesse. in loving my soul. and hatynge my body / They shall
lightly believe that we ben married / And also we shall hastily be married. when
they see us love that one that other /

Then was I much admerueylled of her constaunce and wisdom. and louyd her
better / thanne if she hadd be my propre wife / And how well that we have
sythen lived as husbonde and wife together long time / Nevertheless I saw her
never naked. ne she me Ne never towched the one the other /

The said Malachye recyted and told also to saint Iherom. that on a time
among the other like as he went to pasture and feed the beestes / He saw a
Molle hylle full of Auntes / And long time I took head to the manner of their
living / In consyderyng how some of them bare for to sustain and to continue
their life more gretter paste. and more heuyer by the half than^e they were
theymselfe / And he saw some draw after them. that which they might not
bear / Consyderyng also how they were never idle / And when one of them came
out of his hoole for to bear to ete / That other would never part unto that he
had helped to dyscharge and unlade his fellow /

The condyco^n of the Aunte is such / That when he beryth any herb having
grain / By cause it should not grow within the hoole in the earth he takyth
away the said grayne^ for in the Garner it should he Incontinent grene / With
this considered Malchus the saying of Salamon / the which sent the slowthfull
to the formices or Auntes / And in thinking on thise things / He said to
himself / like as saint Iherom rehercyth / That he was the most slothful of
all mankind / And by this cause he ymagyned how he might escape from the
seruytude where he was in. for to find some monasterye / In which he might
in serving god prouffytably fynysshe his days / Upon this purpoos he
returned home / And cowde not hyde from his wife this heaviness of his courage
/ The which after that he hadd declared and showed to her his caas /

Admonested and counseyled him to flee by night Then said the said
Malachyas. that he had in his flock two beeres. the which he would first slay
/ And of their two skynnes he made two sackes for to bear the flesh of the
two beeres / And when this was done / He and his wyffe awayted that all they
of the house slepte / And then departed and went their way without making
great noise / And after that they had gone ten mile or there abowtes / They
found a River. the which they passed prudently /

For when they were within the River. They went within the same. in
descendynge well low fro their first way for to take an another / To the end
that if any came for to seek them that they should not find the stappes of
their fete / And by cause that they dradde the depnesse of the said River they
passed the water upon their sackes which weren full of their beeres flesh /
The said flesh was so hurt. that they might keep it no l^nger channe
three days / But they recompensed it in drink / For in that water they drank
for the thirst that was to come / After that they had passed the said water /
They ^anne in beholdynge always behind them. for to know if any followed them
/ and more by night thanne by day By cause they fered the Sa^ralyns And also
for to eschew the great here of the day / Yet when he told these things
to saint Iherom / He said that he was not yet well assured of the great feere
that he that time had / And after that he and his wife had gone three days
They saw two men come tofore them. Riding on two Camellis / And supposyd as
it was true / That it was the lord that they had left / Of whom they were so
aferde. that they abode no thing but death / Thus as they were in this
anguysshe. they saw a great pytte by them / In which they went to hyde
them / But wenynge to eschew a great peril. they putt them self in a
gretter / For in the same pytte were Innumerable venymouse beestes The which
had putt theymselfe in for the here of the son / And then^e they said if
god help us unhappy we shall be sauf / And if he dispyse us synnars / we shall
deye here /

After said Malachyas to saint Ierom / Now think fair fader what dread we
had. when we saw the lord and his servant upon the brynke of the pytte
/ The which we had by adventure thus founden / In procedynge ferder to the
end of his caas / Malachyas rehercyth that Inco^tynent as the lord and his
said yoman were comen thither upon the brynke of the said pytte / The lord
made his servant to goo down in to the pytte / And because he was trowbled in
his syghte. because he was come out of the clerenes of the son / He cowde
not know them within / And when he was entered within the heyghte of three
Cubytes / He began to cry. come out ye meschaunt thieves. ye shall annoe be
slain / But Incontinent he was taken of a lioness by the then^e and stranglyd
him / The lord seenge that his yoman carried long / And strongly enangred came
to the said pytte / But anon after he was entered therein / He was in like wise
strangled of a lion /

After recyted and told Malachy as that when he and his wife saw the lord
and his yoman so slain. they were aferde that the beestes should slay them /
And durst not moeue fro thens But they were armed of the wall of clean
conscience / A merueyllouse thing / The brute beestes were more ready to
defend them. thanne they were theymself / On the morn tofore day the said
beestes departed from them And left Malachyas and his wife thereto / But that
notwythstondyng they durst not goo out for the great dread that they had /
And when the even came they went out of the pytte aforsayde / And found
the two camelles on which the lord and his yoman rode rode upon / And so
they both anon light upon them And the tenthe day after they came to Rome
/ There they being comen thither / recounted all their caas to a Trybune
romayne / And after they were sent to Sabituan duke of Mesopotamye / and there
they sold their camelles / And by cause that the Abbot Malchus was deed in the
town of Caromas in Syrye / He dwelled with the Relygyouses And set his wife
after with the vyrgynes /

Think ye now ye that been chaste and vyrgines. observing and kepinge
chastytee and vyrgynytee / That never in that estate ye shall not long be in
captyuytee / Ne also wild beestes mowen not noye ne grieve you / And known ye
for certain that how well that we ben all mortal / Nevertheless ye shall
never see chaste person and clean of heart to be ouercome^ ne put under of his
enmyes /

Thus endyth this prensent treatise of saint Malachye /
Here folowyth the life of saint Poul the simple heremyte / And begyn^yth in
latin Fuit quidam. et cetera Caplm.xxxix.


Saint Poul surnamyd the simple was one of the discyples of saint Anthonye /
made himself an heremyte. by cause yt his wife had given herself to a another
man thanne him / Of which thing when he was aduertysed / he was
merueyllously trowblyd / Nevertheless he told it to no body / But went in
to the deserts And after that he had long gone in the same / He rendered and
putt him self in to the monasterye of saint Anthonye / To whom in arryuyng
there / He demanded and asked first the way. by the which he might be
sauyd / Saint Anthonye said to him That for to get his salvation. it was of
necessyte / that he should do and accomplysshe all that should be commanded
to him / The which answered that he should so do / And then^e saint Anthonye
willing to preue his constaunce said to him / Abide here at this door unto
the time I have prayed god in mine Oratory Saint Anthonye was there a night and
a day all hoole / But nevertheless saint Poul departed not ne remeued not /
but he beheld often by the wyndowe what he did within / And knew that
contynuelly he prayed without moeuyng himself / On the morn saint Anthonye
preached to him of many enseygnements and techynges / In shewinge to him how
some time he must labor and refresshe his spyrytes / Whereby he should after
be more prompte and ready for to pray to god / Also with all his thought and
strength be ought to keep the commandments of god / And at even in
taking his refe^cyon he should ete and drink little And he should drink but
water /

After this that he hadd Instruct and taught him in all techynges necessary
for his health He delivered to him a little Hermytage stondyng three miles from
him / to which saint Anthnoye went often for to vysyte him And always he
found him in feruente devotion. In obseruyng and keeping the rules and
commandments that he had said to him /

On a day came to saint Anthonye some brethern right perfighte and of much
strayghte lyffe / Emonge whom was saint Poul the simple /

And as in an eue^tyde they spoke of the holy scripture. In recytynge and
telling the deeds of Ihesu Christ. and of the prophets / Saint Poul by his
syplenesse demanded / if god had be tofore the prophets / Saint Anthonye
seenge his Imbesilyte and symplenesse / commanded that he should hold his
peace. and depart Incontynente. So he departed by obedyence with out to
answer any thing / And when saint Anthonye saw that he was so humble and
obeyssaunt / He was much admerueylled / And after he commanded him that he
should speak / And that he should say wherefore he spoke not / To whom he
answered. that he had so done by cause he had so commanded him /

Then saint Anthonye was much Ioyeouse and glad of hy^ ansuere And yet
again he admonested him tabyde always and pe^ceuere in obedyence / And often
times he commanded him to do things against reason / As to draw water out
of a deep pytte all day a long / And to cast it on the earth / And sometime
to vnsowe his gown / And after to sow it again / And so of many other
things / But in all he was much obeyssaunte and lowely / And by that manner
he came to perfeccyon /

And therefore said saint Anthonye Who some ever woll be perfyte / He ought
not to be master. ne obey to his own will / ben they reasonable or none For
our Sauyoure says that tofore all thyuges / one ought to renounce his own
will / And with that he says in a another place / I am not descended and comen
in to this world for to do and fulfylle mine will. but the will of him that
has sent me / That is my god almighty / Nevertheless the will of the sone
was never contrary to the will of the fader / Also he that was Doctor of
obedyence when he had done his will. he hadd not be Inobedyente /

Alas then sith that god would not use his own will / But was somoche
obedyente / Wherefore ben not we obedyente to him / Without to obey to our
sensualyte / In leuynge all things contrary to equity and reason /

The virtue of obedyence is more agreeable to god thanne any sacrefyces For this
virtue god showed moo greter miracles for saint Poule than for saint Anthonye /
From all Regyons came seek folks to him / for to recouuer health / The which
thing saint Anthonye seenge. And dredynge that he should be ouermoche let /
For that cause he made him to goo in a another secret place / Where as he
might not be found / To the end that saint Anthonye should receive them
that should come / And if any fayllyd to recouere their health by the prayers
of saint Anthonye / He sent them to saint Poul / And anon they were hoole
and guarysshed /

Emonge other there came one to the which was mad. and so far from
himself / That by the reason of his maladye he bote all them that came to
him / Saint Poul began to pray to god / And commanded the devil which
tourmented him / that he should depart out of his body. But by cause the
devil departed not. and went not oonly Incontinent after he had commanded
him / Saint Poul began to speak to god as little chyldern done / saying /
Truly my god / I shall not ete this day / if thou heel not this seek man /
And anon he was heelyd / All the miracles that he did. god had granted to
him the power. for the great obedyence that was in him / Then ought every
person to enforce him to be obedyent to god in observing and keeping his
commandments /

Thus ends the life of saint Poule the simple Heremyte.
Here folowith the life of saint Paula or Paulyne / And begynnynth in latin Si
cuncta corporis mei membra etc. Caplm.xl.


Saint Iherom says / If all my members were turned in to tongues / And all
they longen thing worthy of praysynge / Yet cowde they not say suffysauntly
of the venerable saint Saint Paula / She was noble of parents / but much more
noble of holiness of life / Rich of patrymonye / But more rich for as much
as she had renounced and forsaken the goods of this world All the days of
her life she complained to god saying / Alas poor synnar what shall I do My
life is lengthed I dwell over long in this corruptible world. in which is
no thing but sin and fylthe / And for asmoche as she said her self a
pilgrim in this world. Often she desired death / and to be with Ihesu Christ
/ The most part of her time she was like by the great abstynences that she
made / Nevertheless armyd with pacyence she said / I chastyse my body. and
putt it in seruytude / To the end that by myself I be not repreuyd / When I
repreue other / And in this great pacyence she saw heaven open for to receive
her / And said / Who shall give to me wings that I may flee. and rest
myself in Paradyce / She loved all the time of her life the sure astate of
pouertee / For when she deyed she was more pore than they whom she gaaf her
alms / Her fader was called Topocius / The which was of the lygnage of
Agamenon / Which ten years duringe held siege tofore Troy the grant / And
at last by him it was destroyed Her mother was named Basylle extracte of the
lygnage of Scypyons Greeks /

This which saint Iherom ^ee^tyh and spekith of. No thing for that he woll
say that the man ne the woman ^en to be praised. for asmoche as they ben comen
of great parentele and lygnage in worldly honor But for asmoche as when some
ben come of high birth and of great place / And they despise the Rychesses of
this world / They show theymself in so dooynge to be of the very lygnage of
Ihesu Christ / And to have toward him gre^ter love / then to them which
have naught or little thing in value And say that they renounce and forsake
all / As some done which putt them self in to Relygyon. for to have
prouysion and suretee of their living Without to have Regard to our savior
Ihesu Christ / Saying that who that shall leave all for the love of god. He
shall have an hundred times more in the end / That is to say the Reame of
heaven / The which is true in saint Paulyne / For for the cytee of Rome which
she left with all rychesses and vaynglorie of the same cite / She is right
merueyllous renommed as emonge many precious stones the most precious and in
excellent virtue shynynge / Like as the son gives gretter light thanne the moon / in like wise saint Paula emonge al holy wymmen most excellently she
shynyth / She fleenge and eschewynge the glory of this world / And therefore it
is to be noted that after the death of her husbonde Toxocius / She dystrybuted
and dealed that one half of his gods unto the poor people / Of which some
were nourisshed. and other clothed And other after their death buried /

And when a poor body was sustained and helped of a another thanne of her /
Anon she was sorry. as though she hadd lost much good /

When she had long time ladde such holy life / She would not endure and
suffer the praysynge of the world For by the occasyon of that she was of noble
lygnage many lords came to vysyte her / Then she began to despise the
honor temporal / In desiring to goo to deserte for to do penance /

In that time it happed that the bysshoppis of the Eest and of the Weste came
to Rome for the decension and strife of some chyrches. Emonge whom saint Paula
saw a notable and a good man named Paulyn Bishop of Anthyoche / And a another
named Epysanus bysshopp of the cytee of Salamonye in Cypres / The which cite
now is called Constance And the said Epifanus was lodged in her house And for
the great virtues of the same Bysshoppis. she was enflammed with love of god
more thanne tofore / And concluded in herself to leave her house in such
manner / That for children ne for the noblesse of her howsene for possessions
that she had. she might never be wythdrawen from her holy purpoos /

And after that the Winter was passed. The same Bysshopps putt them to the sea
for to return to their chirches Then she went with them for to goo to the
hermytages of saint Anthonye. and of saint Paul Heremytes After that she had
saylled by the sea / She descended at a Port named Fratre / And there came
to her all her parents and friends / And that was more pietous came thider
her childer. and whiles they arrived and came a land The ships being then
ready for to saylle and take the sea / her children were at Ryuage or haven /
The little Toxocius held up his hondes to his mother saint Paula / And her
daughter Ruffine which was ready to be married wept. and prayed her yt she
would tarry and abide till the wedding were done / But ye good lady garnisshed
with ferme constaunce held up her hondes and eyes unto heaven / In having more
great pity on her soul. thanne of her children / To whom she showed no more
affection / thanne if they had not ben her children / Ne she their mother /
Now ought it here to be noted that Nature ought to be strongely moeuyd to
pytee and compassyon whanue she saw her children thus strongely weep after
her. But nevertheless she was constaunt and steadfast. and returned not /
Alas there is no martyrdom more sharp. than to depart from friends / Alas is
this not a work against nature. To leave. forsake and abandonne thus her
children. Ye may well think that she hadd great faith / and synguler love to
god / And it may well be byleuyd that she was so wise and prudente that she
louyd them of a feruente love well ordained / For tofore or she departed she
had given to them all her good / Alas she was dysheryted in this world for
to make her rich in a another world /

The ship then sessyd not to saylle. for any prayer that her children made
/ But by cause she might not see them without some heaviness. she turned her
eyes from them / and from the Rynage or cooste where as they were / In effect
the ship saylled so scire that after many days they airyued and came a
land in thyles of Pounce / And by cause the wind was not great. but over
calm among the stony see and many peryllous passages Of which that one was
named Cylla / A another Carthdis. An other Adriaticus. which ben daungeours in
the sea. for the rocks that been there / They descended and came a land And in
goinge a land. she felt her members so weary and ouermoche trauaylled as she
should have deyed. There she took a little refecedco^n for to comfort her /
After that she had be in Citharee, in Rhodes. and in other many yles. She came
in to the isle of Cypre / In which place she soiourned by the space of ten
days with the said Bysshopp Epyfanius / Then when she had vysited all
the monasteryes there she took the sea. and came on land in Scylence After she
came in to Anthyoche. and there she was a little time with ye bysshopp Paulyne
/ Alas the good lady which woned to be borne with.x. Emuches. had not in
walking all these ways. and other here tofore declared but a poor Asle. Upon
which she sat And she vysited not oonly the holy places in the yles tofore
declared. but also she was in them of Syrye and of Fenyce / How well that of
them saint Iherom makyth no mencyon / For he has wreten oonly that which
has be found in holy hystoryes / After that she had passed Iherico. Romayn
and Colugne / She entered in to a little town named Sarepta between Thyrye and
Syrye / And by cause she went abowte all that land. it were a long thing
to recounte what she did in that vyage / Fynably she came in to Iherusalem.
the which cytee has three names / That is to wit Iehus. Salem. and Iherusalem
/ When she was comen thider / The pryncypall of the cytee / having the office
of Proconsull made to be arrayed for her a little place like an hermitage / But
tofore er she soiourned there she went to vysite the holy places / and to
worshipp the holy Cross. whereon our lord was crucyfyed for the Redempcyon of
man kind / Now think we how many teeres she let there then fall. when
she byhelde by a merueyllouse c^mpunccyon / As if our lord had yet ben there
/ In like wise she came to the Sepulture / which was not without kissing and
worshyppynge deuououtly / After in to the mount of Syon / which Dauyd
reedefied / where she saw the pyler bysprente with the precious blood of our
lord / To the which he hadd be bounden for to be beten before Pylate /

There also she saw in the place. in which after the prophecye of Joel. ye
holy ghost descended upon six score persons / After she went to Betheleem
/ And on the right side of the way she tarried to see the Sepulcre of Rachel
in the place where Beniamyn was borne / After she came in to the place where
our lord was borne in the stable / Where she began to be in contemplacyon /
And remembered how the child was laid and wrapped in little clothes by his
blessed mother /

And like as she had be there drawing out her pappes or teetes to give him
souke / She saw also in her faith the three kings worshyppyng the little
child / And the sterre that conduyted and ladde them / Also she contempled
and bywaylled the Innocents there slain / And how the blessed ^vrgyne Marye
fled in to Egypt with her sweet sone Ihesus. Which Joseph and she bare /
And in thise contemplacyons she wept saying / O cytee of Bethleem. said
cytee of bread In which is borne the bread which is descended from heaven /
That is the sone of god / And of whom Micheas the prophet has prophesied /
Thou Bethleem house of Eufrates thou art not the little cytee / But the
nobleste of the cytees of Iudee /

Also saint Paula said to herself Ha unhappy synnar that I am. God has
showed to me more thanne apperteyneth to me / Whan^e now I may kiss the
Crybbe wherein my lord god lay after he was borne Also to pray in ye place
where the vyrgyne bare. and was delivered of a child / Here shall my body
rest perpetuelly. like as Dauyd says in the Psaulter in the hundred and one
and thyrty psalm /

Then after this said saint Paula / Now I am in the country where the
Savior of the world has chose for to make Redempcyon of mankind / My soul
and all my lignage shall serve him / And after she descended to the Toure of
Ader. Nyghe by to the which / Jacob did do pastoure his sheep / And the
Shepherdes also herd the aungellis sing at the Natyuyte of our lord
saying (Gloria in excelsis deo. et cetera) That is to say Glory be to god in
heuens / And in the earth peace to men of good will /

From thens she went to Gaza and took the way on the right hand. and came to
Bethsur and to Eschol / After she went to Sare / And from thens she came in to
Ebron. which is called Cauatharbe / Which is as much for to say as the
castle of four men / Abraham. Isaac. Jacob. and Adam the Grant / For after
that which is wreten of Ihesus name the Ebrewes say yt they were there buried
/ Nowythstonding yt many say yt the fourth man was called Caleph She came after
to the place where that Lazare was raised in to the house of Mary Mawdeleyn and
Martha / In following the same way to Iherico / Wenynge yet to find the good
man which was hurt with thieves / Of whom is made mention in the Gospel / And
the which hadd be left of the priests and ^cuites as deed / Without having
pity on him / But a Samarytane put him on his beeste. And brought him in
sauegarde / When she came to Iheryco she saw there the cite which Ayel
founded in Ab^ram for his first child / She saw also the castellis of
Galgala. And the mystery of the Cyrcumsicyon / The twelve stones brought from
^^om Jordan. sygnesyeng the foundement of the twelve Appostles / In like wise
the fountain of Taby. which some time had he so bitter that no man ne
person might drink of at / The which by Helysee was corned in to swetnesse
/ Tofore the night was passed she came to Jordan the river / Upon the ryuage
or brynke whereof she arested / And at the son rysynge she remembered the Sone
of Justice / And how the priests passed the same flood / How also by the
commandment of Helye and Hely^ee ye waters tarried for to make to them way
She remembered also the puryfycacyon of waters made by the baptym of our
Savior Ihesu Christ. By cause that all the waters were foul and stynkynge of
mankind / A long thing it were to recounte the mysteryes of the valeye of
Acho^ / In the which were A^aryce and theft condemned And of Bethel for the
flode. and also for thoccasion of the house of god where Jacob slepte. having
a stone under his heed / She passed by Syllo. and came to Sychen / And after to
the side of the mountain of Gaazym night to the pytte of Jacob / And there she
entered in to a church. where god tarried / And demanded drink of the
Samarytane / After from thens she departed. and went for to vysyte the
sepulcres of the twelve Patryarkes. and Sebasten named Samarye / Which land
was called Auguste by king Herod to the honor of Auguste the emperor /
There were Helysee. Abdias the prophet. and saint John^ Baptyste / In that
place saw saint Paula merueyllous things / For she saw deuylles tofore the
sepulcres of Helyzee and Abdyas tourment men. The which men howled as wulu^s /
barked as dogs. brayed as lyens. Syfled as serpents. cried like bulls. and
ther^e them to the ground / And fynably she saw many miserable and wretchyd
wymmen inhumaynly hang by the fete / Then she having pity and compassyon of
them began to wept tenderly. In prayeng for them the clemence and meekness
of our Savior Ihesu Christ / And how well that she was much weary. she went
up in to the mountain. And saw the two fosses. in which in the time of
persecuco^n and of famyne Abdias the prophere nourysshed an hundred Prophets
with bread and water And after she went ferder and came in to Nazareth where
our lord was nourysshed / Also to Canaam and Capharnaum / where god showed
many miracles / And to the lake of Thiberiadis hallowed by our lord / Which
saylled over the same in to deserte / In which with five loves and two fysshes
were five thousand men fed and sustained / And twelve baskestes weren filled
with the fragmentes and Resydue / And after she went up in to the mount of
Thabor / In the which god transfygured himself / And from thennes she saw
the mountains of Hermon and Hermonium / and the countreye of Galylee / Where
the Excercyte of Cisara was by Baruth vaynquysshed and putt under / She saw
also the Torrent of the flood of Cyson / The which deuydyth all Galylee / And
the castle by Naym / In which was reysyd the sone of the wydowe / She came
also in to Egypt and in Sochot / where Sampson made to sourde or spring a
fountain out of a great tooth of a Ioywe / And after she came to the flode of
Syor / Which is to say trowble And to the sepulture of Micheas ye prophet
then being there a church She passed also by Choreos. Gethe ^s. Marsea.
Ydumeum. and Lachis / And generally by all the deserts of Egypt / By the
five cytees of Egipte / In which is spoken the langage of Chanaan / And by
Sychen and Chanaos / Where as god did merueyllouse things / And to the cite
of No / which after is called Alexandrye / In that long vyage saint Isodore
Confessor acconpanyed with Innumerable Relygyouse people came and met with
her / And how well that she reputed or Judged her Indygne or unworthy of so
great honor / Nevertheless she enjoyed for the honor of god / She was so
fervent in charity and in the love of Ihesu Christ. that she and her vyrgynes
were content to abide together with all the Relygyouses of deserte / And
peradventure she had abyden there ne hadd be the great affection and desire
that she had to see the holy places. and for the great hete that was then in
the country /

She took after the sea And fro Pelusio came anon after in to Bethleem. and
took her lodging / Where as she dwelled three years /

O glorious Paula / Marye and Joseph cowde find no lodgyng. and thou found
it well / God does more honor in this world to his servants / thanne he
did for himself / There did saint Paula do make many celled and monasteryes
for to lodge the pilgrims / Hither to is wreten of her pilgrimage.

Here folowyth of her deeds and virtues /
THe fairest of which is humylyte. which was in her so perfyghtly. that she
held and reputed herself in virtue lasle thanne her chamberers / And
nothwythstondynge that she had by her many vyrgynes / Always in clothing. in
langage. and in walking she was the leest of all other / After that her
husbonde was deed. unto her last day she ete never with man. what some ever
knowledge or ymagynacyon that she had of his holiness or dygnyte approved /
Ne never she bayned her but for necessyte of sykenesse / Ne never had she
also any soft bed. for what some ever fever or sikenesse yt she endured /
But lay on the ground, layenge under her the hair. or her Robe made of
skynnes / And she considering the psalmyste / that says in his eyghte psalm
/ I shall wasshe all the nights my couche and my bed with teeres / Right so
did she / For night and day contynuelly she was in prayers / And when she
was enforcyd to rest from prayer. by cause of hurtinge of her sight / by
cause she wept contynuelly / She ansuered saying. It byhouyth well to
chastyce and to defoylle the face / The which I have so curyously made fair
/ Is it not well reason that I chastyce my body by penance / The which has been so much nourysshed in worldly delytes and flesshly playsaunces / Long
laughynges and Ioyefull games owe to be changed in to wepynges and waylynges
And for the clothes of sylke that I have women / I shall does me all my life
with the hair / And in so much as I have playsed my husbo^de and the world.
I desire now to playse god

For to declare her chastytee and ye virtues of her. It should never be
possible / Therefore it byhouyth to write of other.

There was never none more debonay^ nor meker thanne she was. Ne more soft to
them that were meke and humble. She fled from them yt were mighty and rich
And if she saw a poor body. He was by her sustained and helped / If she knew
one that was rich. she admonested and desired him for to do well / And never
the poor departed from her. but if he hadd her alms / In having always in
her remembrance the word of our sauyoure saying. That well happy and blessed
ben they that accomplisshe and fulfylle the works of mercy / For they shall
find god merciful / And also like as the water quenchyth the fire. So does
alms the sin / Wh^ that ever shall do alms. he shall be made clean
from all fylthe /

Danyel the prophet admonested and warned Nabugodonosor. saying then to him
/ Bye thy sins by alms / Her money was not atatchyd not put to bye
precious stones for to make rings of gold to put on her fingres / As now done
burgeyses wives / But she turned it in to fair margarytes. That is to say in
to virtues. making fair the soul. and no chynge the body / It suffyseth not
oonly to do alms / Many there ben that done great almesses / And semen
without for the like people full of the grace of god But they ben often
ouercomen and vaquysshyd by the temptaco^n of the flesh / And within forth in
soul they ben roten and mortefyed / It behouyth not oonly to give houses gold
silver / ne other Revenues for the honor of god / But also it is of
nececessyte to give his skin / The good Job was not oonly persecuted in his
goods and his children. but also in his body /

Right so did the deuowte saint Paula / For with this that she gaaf her
goods for the love of god / She gaaf and abandonned her body to penance by
fastings and prayers. and to were the hair. and other mace^acyons of the
flesh / Uneath and with great pain. but if it were a day of great feast.
would she take any oil for her mete and Refeccyon / As the thonder and
tempeste is much enclyned by his nature to tormente and cast down hyhe
places and mountains enhaunsed and raised on heyghte / Right so is envy of
his cursyd Inclynacion more actyf and obstynate to quench and bring to
naught the loos and good fame of virtuous persons and well reno^med The which
thing happed to the holy and deuowte Paula / No thing to the detriment and
hurt of her fair virtues / But to the exaltacyon and sovereign perfeccyon of
them /

She then fructefyenge in good works was enuyed of an evil Papelart and
Ypocryte / Which by envy contynuelly tempted and detracted her Wenynge to
bring her to Impacyence / But she did right prude^tly and wisely her vtylyte
and prouffyte / For in gaderynge and hepynge virtue upon virtue against the
said detraccyons. she meked and humbled herself as much as she might / Like
as she had be grettest synnar of all the other wy^ men And when she was
counseyled yt the should goo her way. like as Dauyd. by cause Saul pursewed
him And as Jacob for his brother Esau / which would have slain him /

She ansuered I know that the devil gyuyth always batayles to the creatures
of god / In what some ever place that they ben And therefore if I yede away.
yet he should give in other places empesshemens or lettynges and bataylles.
peradventure gretter thanne thyes that he gives me now /

On that other side. by cause that I know well / that there is no country
so holy. as this is of Bethleem / I have concluded not to depart fro the
place wherein I am / The enmye is overcome by pacyence / And by humylytee. pride
/ Says not the holy scripture / That who that shall be smeton on that one
cheke. He ought to profre that other / The appostles also went Ioyenge when
they should be martred. for the honor of Ihesu Christ /

Our savior meked himself in taking our nature. when he took man kind / If
Job hadd not ben in pacyence in his aduersytees. He had not herd the voice
of our savior in saying to him / Think Job that I have sent the
persecucion and trowble but to the end that thou sholdest be reputed and
holden Just / They that endure trybulacyon ben reputed and thought well happy
in the Gospel /

She co^syderynge these things / and for to fructefye her pacyence. When the
enuyous Adad some time bote her by words Iniuryous and wrongful / She said
with the psalmyste / When the synnar adressyd him to me for to do me wrong /
I have restrained or hid my word. as I had be muette or dombe / As a deef
man I herd no thing / And as a dombe man opened not my mouth / The
temptacyons come not to the persons but for to preue them if they love god
with all their heart. and with all their soul /

She reduced and called to her mind the word of Ysaye. which says / Ye
that been now out from the pappes. that is to say in aege / Abide trybulacyon
upon trybulacyon / Hope upon hope ought to be had against an evil and
serpentyne tongue full of venyme / For pacyence is proved in trybulaco^n / By
pacyence is gotten strength By that virtue is gotten hope And who that has
steadfast hope / shall never be confounded / Who that is in aduersitee. he
ought to arm him with strength. with pacyence. and with hope / But some time
they that been Impacyent sayen / I endure enough / and take the best wise I
may in pacyence / Nevertheless god helpyth me not / I have hope he shall
help me / But it is long er it come / Such murmurers done great wrong. and
be not pacyent. But full of all Impacyence / For god has said In time due
and oportune I have enhaunced ye And in the day of health I have helped the /
It behouyth not then to dread in any wise the venymouse and wicked tongues /
But we ought to rejoice if we ben wrongefully blamed in requyrynge always the
help of god Yet what some ever aduersytee that we have. Yet we ben not worthy
to have the glory of heaven /

When saint Paula was much seek she said that she was more stronger thanne
when she was hole / For by aduersytees and maladyes / her body gate
Inmortalytee / And yet she said / Like as the passions of Ihesu christ
abounded in me. In like wise by Ihesu Christ. in abundance comes to me
consolacyon and comfort /

They that been fellows of passion / shall also be fellows of consolacyon.

In heaviness. weeping and wayllynge sange saint Poul saying / Wherefor art
thou heavy my soul / Wherefore trowblest me / Have hope in god. For yet I shall
confess him as my god and Savior of my soul /

When she was in peril she said with our lord / Who that woll keep his
soul. and save it. he must lose it And who that woll lose his soul for ye
love of god. he shall save it /

When it was said to her that she was over liberal / And that by this moyen
all her Patrymonye was dysspended. She ansuered / What prouffyteth to win
all the world. if one lose his soul that it be dampened. what marchaundyse
may a man take in recompense of his soul / As if she would say / Like as the
Rychesses of this world ben cause of the dampnaco^n of the soul She said
also I am borne in this world all nakyd / And all nakyd I shall return /
Never ought to be desired any thing in this world / For all that is in the
world is none other thing but fleshely desire / And the evil concupyscence
of our eyes /

And in the end all shall pass / but the good virtues that we get in this
mortal world shallen be contynuelly with us and tofore the death / And in
like wise shall accompanye us our euylles and foul sins /

On a time came to the said good lady saint Paula a good Relygyouse man. The
which said to her^ that for the right great abundance of he^ good virtues /
And that for the right great love that she had to god / she seemed to much
people to be as a fool and Yd^ote / And that for that cause / it were full
necessary and great need to take medycynes for her brain / To the words and
proposycyons of which good Relygyous man the good lady ansuered / My brother
in god we ben all semblable and like / That is to say in a place common where
as all the men in this world shall be assembled And we all ben called fools
for the love of Ihesu Christ / By cause that we have in him set our love and
devotion / And therefore I recomfort me in the sayenges and words of god our
maker / which says to his apposles / For this cause the world hates you /
For ye ben not of the world / And if we were of the world: the world should
love you / The Jews said to our sweet Savior and Redemer Ihesu Christ. that
he was a Samarytane / And that he hadd a devil with in him in his body / And
that in the name of Beelzebub. which is the prince of deuyllis. he chassed and
cast out deuyllis of the bodies of creatures. the which ought to require of
him his mercy / After which words the good and deuowte saint Paula adressyd
her words to god our Savior and Redemer Ihesu Christ. In saying to to him
in this manner / Ha my god my Savior and Redemer Ihesu Criste / thou knoweste
the affection and desire that I have toward the / And the great love that I
bear / And how I am ready and apparaylled to obey and accomplyssh with my
little power al thy commandments / Thou wotest and know all the
thoughts of mine heart / On that other side thou see well and knoweste all
the Iniuryes which have been done to thy servants /

And nevertheless they remember always the / If we keep all thy
commandments / And have our heart on any other thanne on the / We ben like
and semblable to beestes. the which be brought to sacrefyce / My lord god I
count no thing in. such fryuolouse words and deceyuable / For I have hope
that thou shall be always min helper in all mine affairs and deeds / And for
that cause I dread no thing that any man do to me. For every man that shall
honor the shall always be comforted / And also there ought no person of
the world be adradde of what auctorite or estate that he be of / But oonly
thou /

The said good lady saint Paula also observed and kept good pacyence in all
her trybulacions unto her death / In considering that all they then enforce
them to do dysplaysure to their enmyes in desiring vengaunce / They done
again theymselfe / And all their ferocyte and wodnesse retournyth against
theymself /

Here after folowyth of the order of the monasterye of the good lady saint
Paula / And also of the contynence of the deuowte good and holy Relygyouses /
As well of them as came to vysyte her as of other / And how she labored and
did pain in the acquysycyon and purchasing of their health of their souls /


THe said good and right devout lady saint Paula had right great virtues in
her / And so right great charytee. that she gaaff for the love of god all her
goods / and abandonned and forsook all temporell things / for to get
heavenly things. Her vyrgynes were much noble. benygne. soft. gracious.
amyable. and debonayr or meke merueyllously / the which she had assembled of
diverse prouynces / Whom the deuowte lady saint Paula had divided in to three
companyes / And on every company she had ordained a maystresse over them /

And notwythstondyng that they were separate and alone towchynge their etynge
and drinking / Yet were they together for to pray to god / They had among
them a sign to sing Alleluya / And Incontinent as it was song / She came
the first herself for to moeue the other virgynes to come to prayer / On the
morning at hour of Tyerce. at Syxte. at None. at Euensonge. and at
Midnyght. That is to wite at hour of Matynes they song the sawter / And they
were all constrained to come to it / And every day they learned somewhat of holy
scripture / On the Sunday each company of the said vyrgynes. with their
maystresse came to the church to pray and serve god at all the hours
aforsayd / And all the other days of the weke they labored. and wroughte to
make robes and other vestymentes for poor people. or for theymselfe / And if
any were that came late at^ the hours for to psalmodye. or slouthful to do
their work. She corrected them by soft means / And if any of her said
vyrgynes were hasty or wroth / By good love and swetnesse she corrected them
and brought them in the way of health / And if she were soft. humble and
pacyent. Always notwythstondynge she showed and corrected her by good manner.
no more ne less thanne if she had faylled herself / In following the
words of saint Paul the Appostle saying / What woll ye that I do to you /
Shall I correct by rod or by fayrnesse and debonayrte / All were egall /
For they had none other thing but their living and clothing /

And if emonge them were moeuyd any complaynt or debate / By fayrnesse she
brought them again in to love / She constrained the vyrgynes to fast to
chastyse the flesh / And when they saw they had pain in the stomach /
She answered to them that is ^^^e auayllyd to them to be evil disposyd /
thanne that their souls should be like by the syn^e of the flesh If oony
were more worldly or more curyously arrayed thanne the other / She repreuyd her
in saying / that the curyous array of the hody was the fylthe of the soul /
And that never from the heart of a vyrgyn ought to proceed any foul word /
If any were a Iangeler. a Liar. or Chyder / She warnyd her for to amend her
And if she amended her not / She made her to abide tofore the church door for
to pray to god / And to ete and drink out of the company of her systers / To
the end that she should correct herself by shame / She defends theft as
Sacrylege / And that which the worldly men said to be venyall sin / She
reputed and held it a right great dedely sin / For to recounte of her
clemence and lowelynesse. It is a thing merueyllous / If her systers were syke
she served them / And gaaf to them to ete flesh / But when she was in
sykenesse she ete none / And in that pryncypally she was not like to other. She
that was old did more abstynences. thanne her young vyrgynes /

On a time in the monthe of Iuyll for the great hete of the son. She had
the febres or axes / The physycyens counseylled her that she should ete metes
more nutrytyf thanne she had be accustomyd / And also that she should drink
wine / For the water that she drank might cause her to have ye Ydropesye /
But neither for the bysshopp Epifanyus. ne for any other she would not ete any
other thing thanne she had been accustomyd / Helas if we take heed to her
life / we shall find that she made good commutacyons and marchaundyses / And
she wept in this world. to the end that she might laughe in that other /
She ware the hair / to the end that she might have fair vestymentes and
precyouse in heaven / She fasted devoutly for to have spyrytuell Refeccyon. And
she for soke all the goods of this world. for to be Rich in heaven / And
despised the worldly glory. for to have glory everlasting /

On a time she went to an Heretyke. which proposed many questyons The first
questyon was / What sy^ne might a child do. that was tourmented with the
devil / The second. In what aege men and wymmen shall arise from death to
life / Adioustynge to this demand or questyon / If she said in the aege in
which we deye / Then it behouyth to have nouryces for to nourisshe the
children which deyed in young aege / and also tofore the time that they were
sure of the pappes / And if she said that they should arise in other aege /
Then it should not be Resurrecco^n / But oonly transformacion out of one
body in to a another / After he demanded if wymmen should arise as wymmen. and
the men in form of men. Or otherwise / Concludynge if they aroos in form of
men and wymmen / That they should be married in paradys / And if all should
arise in form of men / That the Resurreccyon should not be of those bodies
that were deed /

And when such questyons were to her proposyd / She recounted them to saint
Iherom / The which in speaking to the said Heretyke. and in enfourmynge him
other questyons. confounded his in this manner /

First saint Iherom demanded him if he byleuyd ye Resurrexco^n general / The
Heretyke ansuered Ye / sow ought to believe / For it is an article of the
faith / Secondly he demanded if the same body that deyed should rise again /
He ansuered. Ye For it is also troth / Thyrdly he demanded. if the bodies
should arise in the sex or kind in ye which they should be deed / That is to
wite. if the man shall arise in the likeness of a man / And also in like wise
the woman in likeness of a woman / To this demand or question the Heretyke
ansuered naught / Saint Iherom said after to him / Sith that thou wolt not
ansuere. I shall say to the by manner of ansuere / That if a man rise not in
likeness of a man / And a woman in likeness of a woman / Then it should not
be Resurreccyon of them that deyed The which Resurrexcyon thou grauntest to
be / And also it is true /

We have prouff hereof by our lord Ihesu Christ / The which when he was
arysen showed his wou^des which he had received in the Cross /

And also when saint Thomas towched him in his worthy side / Said not our
lord to his dyscyples / Behold and see my wounds / To the end that
certainly ye believe that I am he that has be crucyfyed. Then that sith our
lord after his Resurrexcyon was seen and towched / And that his discyples
herd him speak / It aperyth clearly thy his members that he arose in likeness
of a man. and not of a woman / For by his members it apperyth that he hadd a
body / By cause that the body is not without members. ne the members also
without body / Therefore it must conclude that the men shall arise as men / And
wymmen as wymmen / As towchinge the conclusyon that the Heretyke made. in
saying. That maryages ought to be made in heaven / Saint Iherom ansuered that
there should be none / For our lord says that after the Resurreccyon
general. shall never be marriage made / And by this the scripture says. that
there shall none be married / And if it be argued to be written. that we shall be
like to good aungellis. the Proposycyon ought to be understand that we shall
be se^blable or like to them in conuersacyon and blessydnesse / As is promised
to us. Not by nature / Saint Johan Baptist tofore that he was byheded was
called an angel But for that he had not the nature of aungellis / The
symylytude or lylenesses of aungellis is oonly promised in holiness of life /
But the nature not for that shall be changed / If any argued in saying. that
god ete after his Resurreccyon. Then we shall ete after that we were raised /
The argument is not prouffytable / For that which was done was for the
approbacyon and veryfyenge of the sayyd Resurrexcyon / He also when he had
Reysyd the said good Lazare / Which had be deed four days. ete with him /

Also the daughter of the Synagoge anon after that god had raised.
Commanded that mete should be given to her / To the end that they that saw
thise. and herd of thise reysinges should. ne might not say. that they were
bodies fantastyke / But were very bodies which had been deed and raised again
/

As towchynge the question of the child vexed of the devil. which had not
sinned / And also in what aege we shall arise / Saint Iherom first says that
the Iugementes of god aren as a great swolowe / His science is also to us
unknown / Never man knew what god has in his entendemente and purpoos /

Secondly ought to be noted with saint Iherom / That a man when he is ten or
twenty. or thyrty. Or a hundred year old is none other than wha^ he is but two
or three. or four year old And nevertheless after the tradycyons and sayenges
of the church. and ye doctrine of saint Poul / we shall rise in the aege of
perfeccyon. In which our lord aroos fro thyrty to two and thyrty years / And
in which aege was Adam fourmyd after that the Jews witness /

In retournynge then to saint Paula / And for to speak of her entendemente.
says saint Iherom that often she kept and observed the commandment that
says (Andi israhel ettace) That is to say Man here and bestylle / For the
good lady Paula was well light to here / And slow to speak / She was curyous
and besie to have books of holy scripture / And radde them gladly / And for
better to prouffyte in them / She constrained saint Iherom to expowne to her
the old Testamente and the new / But when for any doubts he differred to
expowne to her certain proposycyons / Saying to her that he cowde not expowne
them / She would not believe him / But by contynuell Interrogacyons and desires
she constrained him to expowne them after the Sentence most apparent or
lykely. and after truth and good sens /

Her understanding was so great. that she learned of saint Iherom the Ebrewe
tongue / In such wise that she song the psalms of the Psaulter in Ebrewe
tongue / And song no more in latin / After that we have recyted of. her holy
life and conuersaco^n. that is to say of her glorious departing out of this
world. When the good lady saint Paula felt that she had no more hete. but a
little in her stomach / She began to say these words that follow in weeping
and wayllynge bytterly. O my god I have desired the beaultee of thy heaven and
glory / O lord that thy Tabernacles and dwelling places ben fair and
shynynge / O lord god I have more desire to be in thy house. that is in the
church than to dwell with them of ye world Anon after she cessed to speak
and saint Iherom seeng that she ansuerd not to any thing that he demanded or
asked of her / He asked why she ansuered not / And if she had in her heart
any heaviness or gryef / The good lady ansuered in Greek / Nay / but she saw
all Ioyousete and gladness / After she spoke no more / But sygned her with
the sign of the Cross / There were diverse bysshoppis. as well of Iherusalem
as of other places And with them were great nombre of priests. and
Innumerable companyes of vyrgynes. and Relygyouses / In presence of whom she
herd our lord / which called her saying / Come to me my spowse my culuer
or douue / For the winter and the Rain ben passed / To whom she answered /

The flowers ben on the earth / The time of Harueste is come / I believe to see
the goods of our lord in the land of living people / And in thus saying
she rendered to god her blessed soul / But in so dooynge the people being
present were not moeuyd to weeping ne wayllynge / like as men of the world
now a days done for their parents and friends / Whom they have soon forgoten
/ But the bysshoppis set hand on the Byer / The other herynge lamps and
tapres^ And other singing deuowte Ympnes and Psalms in the mydle of the
church / And in the sepulture of our lord where our savior Ihesu Christ
was buried / All the people of the cytees of Palestyne came to her Entyerement
/

And so many of Relygyouses men and wymmen were there / that it was
merueyllouse to see and behold^

And in effect if any defaylled there that had not ben at their last
service. They were reputed. and holden. as Sacryleges /

The Wydowes and poor Wydowes to the example of Dorcade sheweden there the
vestymentes. which the good lady saint Paula had made / And generally all
poor persons cryeden after her / As after their mode:

Let us think then we miserable synnars / And pryncypally they that amasse
and possess great Riches and tresours / How the good lady Paula abandouned and
forsook all her tresour for to give for goddis sake / He las what cowde one
more give / She retained and kept no thing for herself / Think merchants
what marchaundyses she made / When she changed all her gold and her silver
in to things Incommutable / She forsook all for to have all. And she would
be right poor for to be Rich /

Saint Iherom after this adressyd his words to ye daughter of saint Paula
which was much deuowte / For she followed the good and virtuous manners of her
holy mother /

O Eustochium Rejoice thyselfe my daughter / For I know that thou haste but
little good in this world / But thou ought to enjoy the for thyn holy
mother / Which by long martyrdom is crowned in the glory of heaven She has
spared to the great Rychesses / For thou shalt have by succession thy god.
which is more Rich Tresour thanne all the gold in the world / Thus in
Bethleem where god was born deyed gloryously the good saint Paula / Of whom the
glorious soul flewe in to heaven in to everlasting glory and bliss /

The which grant to us the eternal god in one essence and three in persons
/ By the merytes and prayers of the glorious saints. saint Paula and saint
Iherom her singular and most special friend in this world and in ye other /
Amen /

Thus ends the life of the right devout and holy woman saint Paula /
Here folowyth the lyfe' of saint Pelage / And begynnyth in latin Quid factu^
est. etc / Caplm.xli.


Among you that woll know. that god our maker woll not lose a Christian man /
How great a synnar that he be / Herke. and often read the life of saint Pelage /
And ye shall know if ye woll return to god our Maker by penance. that ye
shall have remyssyon / And in the end foryeuenesse of your sins / Then
sy^nais ye ought to rejoice yourselfe of that ye here / For it is all aid
and comfort that comyth to you. And also cause of lamentacyon / An holy
bishop of Anthyoche for certain cause called together for certain causes
althe bysshoppis nyghe abowte him / which came to him to the nombre of eyghte
Emonge whom was an holy bisshopp called Nonnus / that was a Religyous man of
the monastery of The benesyens / And by cause that he was of right holy life. He
was violently and by strong hand rauisshed from his abbaye and elect
bysshopp / The which Bysshoppis assembled. were commanded by the said saint
Nonnus and his seruytours / And they should assemble in the church of saint
Iulyan the marter / And to the regard of other they were put in howses nighe
the church / They being there prayed the said holy Bisshopp Nonnus that he
should say to them some thing for the health and comfort of their souls The
which thing he granted to them benygnely / And desiring sore to prouffyte
himself and them also. Began to enduce them. and teache them after the
doctrine of our Redemer Ihesu Christ / On a time emonge the other as he preched
to them of the holy Gospel / He saw pass tofore him upon a little mulet the
most excellent Iougleresse or Daunceresse that was in the cytee of Anthyoche.
so rychely and worldly ornate and arrayed / That upon her was seen no thing
but gold and silver and rich pyerrerye / And with that she had a Coler of
gold about her neck / and also was accompanied with servants and
chambryeres in like wise arrayed / In passing thus in the way. she filled the
air with merueyllouse sweet odours and savors / When the Bysshopps saw her
so pass. considering the beauty of her / turned the yr eyes to the earth /
To the end that they should not by her commyse or thy^ke any dedely sin /
Saint Nonnus beheld her right affectuously. and after demanded the other
Bysshoppis if they had any desectacyon o^ playsaunce in the beauty of the
said fair woman / The which answered no thing / Then the said Nonnus
began to weep and waylle. In such wise that his bosom was full of teeres /
And yet again he demanded them if they rejoiced not them in beholdynge of
the same woman And like as before they answered not /

Then he said to them / Truly I have strongly delyted me. And her beauty
has merueyllously playsed me / For god has ordained her to set her tofore
his seete. which is merueyllous when he shall Judge us. and them of our
Bysshopryche / And yet he said to his fellows the Bysshoppes / My right well
bylouyd friends. Think how often she has kembed: washed. and made fair
herself for to playse her amourouse or loves. which this day ben / And tomorn
shall not be / She appointed herself so honestly. that there fayllyd not a
pynne. as towchynge to the world / And if she for to playse the world takith
so much business Alas we that have god our fader god king of heaven and of
earth. what shall we do / And who shall give to us the heavenly goods. which
may not be estemyd nor thought / What shall we do / Truly we ought to have
sovereign cure and besinesse to be always arrayed and made fair with clennesse
of heart and of pure conscience

And in like wise ought we for to wake for to find the ways and means by
the which we may playse him in dooynge to him seruyse aggreable / Thise
things said saint Nonnus took his deaken by the hand. and went in to the
house / Which was ordained for them to be lodged in / After he wythdrewe him
in to his chamber. In which he fell down to the ground / in weeping and
smiting his breast and began to say / O my god that know the things
hid. I may not hyde how that by the deceyuable a raiment and dyshoneste
clothinge of a sinful woman / The beauty of my soul has be maculate and
defoyllyd / In what manner o my god shall I mow pray to the / Or how shall I
mow Iustyfye me tofore the / Thou knoweste all my thought / Maledyccyos or
cursydnesse shall come to me. For I offer to the sacrefyse. And also make fewle
my soul b^ sin / The synful woman thinkyth on no thing but to playse the
world / And I have promised to the faith and loyaulte / And have not kept it
to the O my lord god I am out of thy grace / Alas I have no more hope of my
good works. but only in thy mercy / By the which I hope and entende my
salvation.

The good saint Nonnus abode by long space of time in such heaviness And the
Sunday following after that he had said his Hours with his Deaken / He
recounted and showed to him a dreme / But he cowde not erpowne it / This dreme
was of a black douue foul of much fylthe / The which as it semyd to saint
Nonnus that in singing his mass it came to the corner of the awter. And after
came fleenge all abowte him / And gaaf so great a stenche / That he might
not abide to feel it / And after that he hadd song the mass in coming out
of the church / The same douue came again. fleenge about as she did tofore.
In gyuynge to him so great a stenche that he might not endure to smelle it /
Then he raughte his hand upon the same douue so dylygently that he took
it / And threw it in a vessel full of water / In which she left all her
ordures and fylthes And flewh a way also white as a Swanne / And so vanysshed
from his eyes / And all this said the holy man that he had seen in his
sleep /

These things thus said they tweyne went in to the great church where as
the Bysshopp was / Whom they salewed / When the Gospel of the great mass
was said / The bysshopp commanded to saint Nonnus. that he should goo preche
/ And make a sermon to the people / Anon he went in to the prechynge stole /
Introducynge and enfourmynge the people being there at the said church in the
faith of god / And syngulerly preched of his great Judgment to come / And of
ye glory of heaven / And by his fair Introduccyons and exhortacions was the
people moeued to penannce. and to contryco^n / In such wise that all began to
waylle and weep for the horror and great dysplaysaunce that they hadd of their
sins /

Now it happed that this sinful woman Pelage. which had passed fore by. and
arrayed as before is said came to this sermon / The which herynge the words of
the right good holy man / And notwytstondyng that she never had served god.
but all only the world. She had so great contrycyon. and so bitter
dysplaysaunce of the enormyte of her sins. that she fou^dred all in teeres.
In such wise that she semyd that she mystrusted the mercy of god / And hadd
none other countenance but contynuelly to waylle and weep / Nevertheless she
commanded to tweyne of her children that were at that time with her. that they
should abide in the church / And take good head whyther the holy man went.
and where that she might find him / The children did soo^ and followed the
holy man unto the church of saint Julian the martyr / And after came and told
it to their mother / And then she wrote to him a lettre in substance /

To the right Reverend holy man dyscyple of Ihu^ christ you holy man haste
preached that thy god is so much and low meked himself. that he has taken
mankind pryncypally for to save the synnars and Plublicans. And he whom the
aungellis dare not behold has wylled to converse and dwell with the synnars
in this world / O my right dear lord. I have often herd said of the / That
thy holiness is much great / And that thou ledest a right perfyghte lyffe /
And how well that thou haste not seen him thy said god with thy bodyly eyes.
the which showed himself to the Samarytane / Nevertheless thou seruest him /
Dredeste. and worshyppest soueraynly. As the Christian people publisshen and
sayen / Therefore I byseche the that thou woll not despise me / Notwythstondynge
that I be a sinful woman / And that it may playse the to teache. and enfourme
me in such wise that I may perfyghtly know mine everlasting god / Without
whom I may have no pardon / ne remyssyon of my sins /

The which letter seen by saint Nonne. he wrote to her again in this manner /
O woman what some ever thou be / Thou art known of god / The which also
knowyth thy will / I pray the that thou tempte not mine humylytee. in folyly
prasynge me / For I am a sinful man / and unworthy seruytour and Servant of
god / But if thou have will to se me / And by me know and receive our good
faith / There ben in this cytee other Bysshoppis and notable prelates with
whom thou shalt see me / For it is no thing leyffull that thou allone should
speak to me /

When the poor sinful woman had seen this lettre / She Incontinent departed
and went in to the church of saint Julian / In the which were present all
the bysshoppis / And she did to saint Nonnus to have knowledge of her coming /
Which Incontinent assembled and brought together the said bysshoppis / And
that done made her to come to him / Anon she fell down to the fete of the
holy Bysshopp saint Nonne saying /

I pray the my lord that it playse the in following thine doctrine. to
stratche upon me thy mercy / and make me a Christian woman / I am the sea of
sin. and the swolow of wyckydnesse which asks and requires to be baptized
/ Saint Nonnus made her to stand up / And said to her / My friend the holy
Decretes ben such. that a public and comin synful woman ought not be
baptized / If she give not pledge never to return to her sin.

This ansuere herd she fell down again to his fete / In washing them
with her teeres. and wypynge them with her here / and said to him / O Nonnus
I pray humbly to the god that my sins and wyckydnesse be to the Imputed. if
thou dyfferre to baptyse me / And also I pray with this that thou never have
part ne porcyon with the saints in heaven / if thou make me not now Christian /
And ferder more that thou be constrained to forsake his law / And adoure and
worship the ydollis / if thou espouse and wedde me not this day unto him / by
the right holy sacrament of baptym Then^e all the bysshoppis and other that
were there. sayden that they had never seen any sinful woman have more
bitter dysplaysaunce of her sins /

Then they sent the Deaken of saint Nonne unto the Bisshopp of the cytee /
For to recyte and show to him this caas / To the end that he should send one
of the Abbesses which were to him subgette / for to enfourme and comfort this
said poor sinful woman / The Bysshopp herynge these things was much
Ioyefull and glad And sent thither saint Romayne ye abbess. which was chief
in virtue and dygnytee / Which found the said sinful woman weeping in great
habundaunce and plentee of teeres at the fete of the holy man saint Nonnus /
Which uneath might make her to arise / But nevertheless she said to her /
My daughter arise up and confess and utter all thy sins / To the end that
thou be baptized / Then she answered / Ha madame if I should well examyne and
search my conscience / I should find that I never have done any good But have
given and habandonned me to all maledyccyon and wickedness / And know that
my sins ben more grette in nombre thanne the gravel of the sea / But I
trust in god / and having confiaunce in the / he shall efface and put away
all my fylthes of sin Then^e the holy man saint Nonnus asked what her name
was / To which she ansuered. I am named Pelage / How well they of Anthyoche
call me Margaryte by cause of the pyerrye or nyce and dyssolute and wanten
ornements and raymentes of which late I arrayed mine vile and detestable
caroyne / In making of the same openly and maddely the work and boutye of the
devil of hell /

Anon after saint Nonne baptized her And named her by her name Pelage / And
after mynystred unto her the body of our lord. And that done he left her in
the governance of saint Romayne / And gaaf to her his benedyccyon / After
saint Nonne said to saint Iherom / My friend and brother we ought this day
to rejoice us / And to ete oylle and drink with spyrytuell gladnesse^ more
thanne we have been accustomed and used. In taking consolacyon and comfort of
the health of this sinful woman / And so concluded to dyne together / And thus
as they took their refeccyon. They herd the devil cry at their gate. like
unto the voice of a man. saying / O maledyccyon / O maledyccyon / Wherefore is
that I suffer so much of this old man here / Suffysed not it enough that he
has converted thyrty thousand Sarrasyns to the Christian faith / And in like
wise the noble and great cite Helyopolis. the which adoured and worshipped me.
and all they that conuersed and dwelled in it / And sith has take a way from
me mine hope / I shall no more endure his machinacions / Acursyd be the day yt
tholde man was borne / Such words or semblable in substance cried the devil
tofore the yate / and yet again in adressynge his words to saint Pelage said
to her Ha mi damoysel thou make to me the pain that I suffer and endure /
Thou Resemblest to Judas that sold his master which was one of the nombre of
his dyscyples / Thou haste in like wise sold me to this old man Nonus /
Then saint Nonne said to her / That she should bless her with the sign of
the holy Cross / which she did / And Incontinent and without taryenge the
devil vanysshed away. Two days after she sleped with saint Romayne. The
devil apperyd to her and awoke her / And after said to her / My friend
Margarete what thing have I done to the / I have enryched the with gold and
silver / And have done to the all that. which thou haste demanded o^ desired
of me / Wherefore do thou to me so great dyshonoure to become Christian /
Then she blessed her and said to the devil / My god which has preserved
me from the deuomynge of thine horrible teeth has set me in his heavenly
chamber / And yet I hope that he shall fight for me against the / Which
demaundest and desyrest no thing but mine perdycyon / And after the devil
came no more to her /

The third day after that she was baptized she sent for her sone / to whom
she said / That he should goo in to her Garderobe / and to put in writynge
all that she had / As well gold and silver and other goods / And that he
should bring all to her / without to leave any thing / The which child did
so /

After she went for saint Nonne and for her ghostly mother / And when he was
come she said to him / My lord and friend. loo here the Richesse of which
Satan has enryched me /

Now I put them in to thy power and dyscrecion / And I ask never any
thing. But the Richesse of Ihesu Christ / The said saint Nonne called the
eldeste of them that kept the church / And delivered to him all the same
Richesses. In saying to him / I command the in the honor of the Trynyte of
heaven that thou never entree in to this church / Till that thou haste
dystrybuted all these goodes^ As well to poor wydowes and orphelyns As to the
suffretous. poor and nedy / To the end that the goods gotten by sin. be
made tresoure of Justice /

With this the holy man cursyd and excomyned all them that should do^ the
contrary and their houses / if they received and kept any thing / After she
called all her children. and said to them / My children I pray you to
depart you from this world. to the end that as we have been together / we may
be in like wise together in heaven. For here ye may get no thynge^ but sin
and wyckydnesse /

The eyghte day after her baptysynge / the said Pelage aroos up at
mydnyghte / And saint Nonne cladde her with the here / And a groos and course
robe of a man / And after the said day she never entered in to the cytee of
Anthioche / When saint Romayn knew it she began to weep / By cause she had
lost her company / And saint Nonne comforted her in saying That she had
chosen the right holy way. like as the Gospel conteyneth / In the which is
found that our lord preferred Marye Magdalene. ledynge Contemplatyff lyffe.
tofore her faster Martha. which ladde actyf life

The good Pelage in this habyte dyssymyled went to Iherusalem. in to the
mount of Olyuete / Where our Redemer prayed to god his fader tofore his
sorowefull passion / And there she made a lityll house. where she determined to
dwell /

A little time after the Bisshopp of Anthyoche. called together all the
bysshoppis that he had assembled / And sent each of them in to his
bysshopryche / Three or four years after the deaken of saint Nonne had a will
to goo to Iherusalem: for to vysyte the holy sepulcre of our lord / And the
other holy places. in which our lord suffered for us so many torments and
myseryes / And asked leave of his bisshopp / Which lyberally granted to him /
Chargynge him for to inquire in the said place of a Relygyous named Pelage /
Which was departed before time from him / And how well that the said Bysshopp
named the said Relygyous Pelagius / Nevertheless he mente the good servant of
god pelage the which was cladde in thabyte of a man and secretly departed as
to fort is said / And for that cause he named her by the name of a man / image
nynge that by cause of her clothing she had changed her name / This deken
then went to Iherusalem / And after that he hadd accomplysshed his
pilgremage / he fond the good relygyous in the mou^te of Olyuete in which she
had be all way closed and shette in her lytyl house / which had none
openyng but a lytyl wyndowe / at which the said deken knocked. and anon she
opened it / And how be it that she had never be seen but ones sith that she
had be in her great beaulte and pomperye / yet nevertheless she knew him But
he could not know her by cause she was so deffayted and dysfygured by the
great abstynences that she made in such wise that the bones perced the skin
/ And hadd her eyes within her head so deep and holow / hat she seemed better to
present a deed body than a living woman / She seyeng this deken she demanded
him of whens he was / To whom he ansuerde that he came fro anthioche / and was
thither sent by his bisshoppe Nonus for to visyte her / Then she said to the
same deken. My brother and friend say to him that I pray him that yt may
playse him to pray to god for me / I hope that his prayers ben to me much
prouffytable / For he is a devout man and of an holy life / And incontinent she
shytte her wyndowe / and began to say her tierce / And ye deken in like wise
nygh to the wall said with her / and after returned in to Iherusalem much
comforted of the sight of one so holy woman. Fro thens he went to vysyte all
the monasteryes and holy places of the cite and for to see the relygyouse
people With whom he being there he herd say thyngys merueyllous of the holy
religyous Pelagius / In deuysynge of whom they spoke of the said Pelage For
they supposed that she had been a religyous man / by cause she feigned her
allwaye to be a man / And named her self Pelagius / The same deken for the
great virtues that he herd say of her / would ones goo to vysyte her / and came
and knocked at her wyndowe / as he had don to fore / And by cause that the said
Pelagyus ansuerde nothynge^ he called him by his name / but nevertheless she
ansuerd not wherefore he ferynge to offend her returned thens by the space of
three days / the which passed and wenynge that he had be departed out of
that place knocked again at the wyndowe so hard that he opened it / And
lokynge in to the little house he saw pelage which was deed / Then he came in
to Iherusalem and shewde it to the relygyous people of the cite / the which in
great multitude came thither for to fetch the corpse / And after that they hadd
brought it out of the ^elle or ytyll house. And by cause it was the custom to
enoynte the deed bodies with myr^e / in enoyntynge the body they knew well
that she was a woman Then they began to sing and render graces and
thankynges to god / in preysynge and magnyfynge his louer^^yn bounte / for
contemplaco^n of his noble ^^clours which ben hid not oonly in holy men but
also in vertuoule wymen / which by strayte and hand penaunces have gotten the
Royame of heaven. And after they put the body in a rich tomb garnysshid with
gold and precious stones.

Then late us pray unto this holy woman pelage that by her Intercessyons and
prayers we may come to everlasting bliss in heaven Amen /

Thus ends ye life of saint Pelage
Here follows the life of saint marie Egypcyen which in deserte ladde a
solytarye life. And begins in latin. Fuit quidam Senex et cetera / Capitulum
xlii.


Saint Jerome recounteth. that in the country of palestyn in which is the
cite of Iherusalem was sometime a right prudent man of notable life in deeds and
word named zozymas And we find that there was another in like wise so named
which was an herytyke of whom at this time we shall make no mencyon / but
oonly we shall speak of him that we have first named / he walked through all
palestyn^ in vysytyng devoutly all the holy places and monasteryes that were
there /

Of him self he fond many manners for to chastyse the flesh. And for to make
it subgette to his spyryte / And in effect he was of so great renomme that
there came to him from far countrees for to here his doctrine And every man
merueylled of his great abstynences /

His mother in his Infancye and yongthe put him in a mouastery. In which he
lived by the space of fyfthy year / During the which for the most part he
was gretely persecuted with dayne cogytacyons and thoughts / In resystynge of
whom he had in such wise foughten against the devil by great and hard
abstynences / that him semyd that in all the Deserts. there was no man that
exceded him in doctrine ne in penance. as he that in his person had
experymented. And in such wise that by that the devil had made him to fall
in to vain glory

And thus as he was in this same fantasye / An ancient fader came and said to
him / My friend I wot well that in all thine operacyons and works thou haste
overcome the devil. saut oonly in this that thou wenest that in thise parties
ben none relygyous persons living more perfyte thanne thy self. ne that
better known the ways of health thanne thou do / But for as much as I
know the contrary / If thou wolte come with me / I shall led the in to a
monasterye. fast by the flood of Iourdan / In which for to take from the this
folly / Thou shalt mow see of Relygyouses more perfyte thanne ever thou were
/ Then went forth the good man Zozimas in folowenge the holy fader /

Now it is to be noted that it was the angel of god. which in the lykenes of
an holy fader conduytted him. The which Incontynente as they were at the
said flood vanysshed a way / Neuerthesse Zozimas being by the flood Iourdan
herd a voice resownynge /

And in coming nyghe to the same he arrived at a monasterye And after that
he had knocked at the gate / He that kept it showed it to the abbot Which
for contemplacyon of his habyte / And also by cause that he semyd to be a man
of holy life. made him to entree in. and received him honestly /

After that he hadd made his oryson The Abbot demanded of him the cause why he
came to vysyte them / And Zozimas answered. for to learn the health of his
soul / For he had herd say that great miracles and signs of virtues were
made there within / The Abbot said to him / My brother a man may not teache a
another of himself. if he help not himself in prayenge god his conduytour in
all his works / And therefore I pray to god that he make us such that we
may observe and keep his commandments / But sith it has playsed the to
vysyte us. thou shall abide with us if thou be for that cause come hyder / And I
believe that god shall accompanye us together all in his grace / For he is the
Pastor of Pastoures / Which has put his soul / That is to say his
propre life for to redeem and save us /

Zozimas being in this same monasterye saw some Relygyouses shynynge in
virtues / And in esperyte incessauntly waking day and night in orison and
prayer / And never proferred they one vain word / Ne occupied them in any
things te^porell / But as they had been deed their names were unknown /
Their life and passety me was of holy words / And for to sustain nature ete
but bread and water oonly /

This considering Zozimas he prouffyted much greatly in following their holy
life / After that he had been there a certain time / The holy time came the
which they must fast the Lent / Wherefore all they made them ready to
saynctefye and make them holy against the time of the passion and Resurrexion
of our lord /

Now it was so that the yate of the said monasterye was never open / To
the end that no man should entre^ which should let them to pray to god /
For to know then how they proceeded in their fastings / It is to be noted
that the first Sunday of Lent. all together came to the church / And there
received their maker in great and seruente devotion / And after that they had
done and accomplysshed their o^ysons / The auncyentes embracyd and kyssed e^he
other in sign of synguler love /

Envy for to opteyne benefyces and pryouryes for to have occasyon to lepe out
of their monasterye was not lodged there / And they resembled not ye bird that
flees always abowte the cage for to find an hole. That is to say an Abbaye or
Pryorye. for to flee thorugh the feeldes and country /

For to return then to our purpoos after that they had kyssed each other
They prayed humbly to thabbot that he would make to god deuowte prayer for
them / To the end that they might strongely fight against the fend /
These things done all the y^tes were opened / And all together songen the
song or psalm (Dominus illuminaco^) Psalmo.xxvi. And when they were out of
their monasterye for to goo in to deserts / Two of the Relygyous men abode
within the church / Not for doubt ne fere that they should lose any thing /
But to the end yt their Oratory should not be without prayer Eeueryche of
them bare. his necessytees for to live by / Some a little bread Other fygges
or dates. Or pesen or benes for to make potage with a little water / Some other
bare no thyge but her mantellis with which they were cladde / And in the
Deserts ete but herbs that grew there / Each after his appetyte and will /

For being there they ladde such rule as they would. By cause they went not
one with an other / Thus passed they the flom Iourdan separate and far from
the cite. in going by the deserts / And if by adventure one saw a another come
against him. he took anon a another way. Without speaking one to a another /

And in this wise ladde they a lyffe much solytarye / And their fastings thus
continued till palm Sunday / At which day they all were returned to
their monasterye / And eueryche brought the fruit of his abstynence / Neither
never asked they one of a another how they had lived in the deserte / To the
end to eschew vain glory /

For some of them ladde a life full hard and sharp. And if the other had
known it / They had praysyd him / And would have told it each to other / By
which the devil might have tempted them by vain glory / And by this it
apperith that they fledoe the praysynge of men / Which might bring forth
no prouffyte /

But it is right peryllous and dommageable to the soul /

Zozimas then passyd the flom Iourdan by the example of the other. and bare a
little bread with him for to sustain his poor body / And if he was sobre in
etynge. Yet he was more in slepynge / And so passing thorugh the deserte /
Always he desired to find some holy man / By whom he might be the better
enfourmyd and Instruct. thanne he had been tofore /

After that he had walked by the space of twenty days / About the hon i^ of
Syxte. he tarried to pray and to make his orysons to god / as he had be
accustomyd / For his custom was at the hour of Tyerce. Syxte. and None for to
cease of walking for to make his prayers /

And as he lift up his eyes. beholding on the right side. he saw the
shadow of a body of mankind / Wherefore he was much abashed / Wenyng that it
had been a thing fantastyke And blessed him with the sign of the Cross /
And his prayer finysshed saw a person all nakyd go tofore him toward the
South / The which was all black of the great hete of the son^e Having her
heeres white as wulle which henge abowte her neck /

Then^e he much admerueylled and replenysshed and fulfilled with great Joy
began to run to the place where as the person was / The which also in
seenge him was gretely abashed / Zozimas merueyllynge in him self thought
that it was some holy person / And when she saw that he came nyghe her /
She began to run in to the wood / And Zozimas always after. till he was so
nyghe her that he might lyghtely call her / And spoke to her saying /
Wherefore fleest thou tofore a poor old man full of sin. and unworthy
servant of god /

Now supposyd Zozimas that it had be a man / But it was saint Marye ye
Egypcyen. or Egypciaca. To whom he said / I adjure the in the name of god /
for the honor of whom thou holdeste the in these deserts that thou tarry and
speak to me /

As soon as Zozimas had preferred and spoken these words / They came nyghe
togyders / in a place where as ran a little broke or water / But always the
same person fled forth from him / And Zozimas passed over the water went
after on the other side of the broke /

And seenge that he cowde not attain ne ouergete her began to weep. prayenge
her that she would speak to him / Then she spoke and said / Fader Zozimas
wherefore chacest thou me Let me alone I pray the in the name of god. For I
may not turn my face toward the / For I am a nakyd woman / Wherefore give to
me thy mantel for to couere my poor and my serable nature / And then I shall
speak to the /

When Zozimas saw that. she called him by his name / He esteemed and trowed
that it was showed to her by reuelacyon of god / Seen that she never had had
tofore seen him. And anon he took of his mantell^ and threw it to her / In
tournynge his face a way from her / And anon as she had covered herself the
best wise she cowde. She said to Zozimas / What weneste thou to se but a
sinful woman / Zozimas knelyd down then^e on his knees and asked of her hy^
benedyccyon and blessing / In like wise did she to him / And long were they
both in this state on their knees / Zozimas saying / Dame give to me thy
benedy^cyon / And she said semblably and in like wise / Fader give to me thy
benedyccyon / For thou art a priest / And therefore it apperteynyth better to
the / thanne to me /

Zozimas strongely abashed said to her / Truly my friend thou art full of the
grace of god / For thou knoweste mine name and mine office / The spyrytuell
grace is not given oonly for the order of dygnytee of Preesthode /

But by the good works that the person does / And therefore it apperteyneth
to the first to give the benedyccyon / The good woman conse^ted and said /
Blessed be the Redemer of our souls / Zozimas ansuered / Amen. Anon they
aroos up And after saint Marye Egypcyen said / I demand and ask the.
wherefore haste thou take so great paynt for to se a sy^full woman / Zozimas
ansuered. this has not be oonly by my will / But also by suffraunce of
almighty god / If it be so said she. I pray the that thou recounte and tell
to me of the conuersacyon of the lygnage of mankind and of the princes and
pastors of the church / In two words Zozimas answered / God almighty has
given peace to all his people / But I pray the that thou pray for the
confyrmacyon of the peace. and for my sins / And she ansuered saying / Thou
that art a priest ought to pray for all the world. and for me poor
sinful woman / For that is thy vocacyon.

But for to playse the I shall make my prayer to god in such wise as thou
haste commanded me / How be it that I am an unworthy sinnar / Then she lift
up her eyes and her hondes to heaven / And was long in prayer /

During the which Zozimas saw a thing much merueyllous / For be the grace
of god. she was eleuate and lift up on heyghte a cubyte above ye e^the /

Zozimas seenge this vysyon began^e to sweet and tremble for feere / And wyste
not what to say sauf Lryricleyson Wenynge that she had been a spirit
fantastyke The blessed woman seenge that / comforted him saying /

Wherefore tremblest thou / Thynkest thou that I am a spyryte fantastyke /

Wherefore art thou scandalyzyd in me / Believe hardely that I am a poor
sinful woman / Baptized with ye holy sacrament of Baptysme / And am no
thing fantastyque. but a sparcle of fire / Ashes. and flesh /

And when she had said this / She began to bless her forhede. her eyes.
her lyppes. and her breast with the sign of the Cross / Saying after / I
pray god that he woll delyuere us fro the hondes of the fend / The which
has great envy upon us /

Zozimas herynge her Proposicyons knelyd down at her fete / And prayed her
saying / In the name of god that was borne of the holy vyrgyn. for the honor
of whom thou dooste here penance / Say and tell to me what thou art. and of
what place And for what cause thou art come to dwell here / For I require not
to have vain glory of thy vysytacyon / But oonly for to be taught and
enseygned of the Which am a poor synnar / I believe in god. by whom thou
lyuest and co^uersyste in this Deserte / And for to know him I am come hither /
To the end that thou tell to me thy virtues and abstynences / For if it
playsyd not him that thou sholdeste show to me thy fayttes and deeds / Never
would he have suffered that I should have seen the /

She answered in this manner / Truly my fader I am asshamed to say to the the
lecherye and pouertee of my body / I know well that Incontinent that I shall
recounte and show to the the sins that I have commysed and done / Thou
shalt flee from hens /

But for that I pray the that thou leave not to pray for me / To the end that
I may have mercy at the end of my days / Zozimas herkenynge wept much
strongely / And she began to tell how she was born in Egypt / And how in
forsakynge her fader and mother. and their fair Instruccyons and shewynges /
she being twelve year of aege. transported and put her in to Alexandrye /
After that aege. and during the time of seuentene years and more. she had
contynuelly made resydence at the open bordell of the same town with other
common wy^men there being. In abandonnynge and using (...) be propre body to
all that came / And with no other thing gate her living. in passing so her
yongthe.

On a time she living in this folly saw a multitude of people of Lybye and of
Egypt / which sayden would pass the sea Then she asked one of them.
whyther they would goo / And wherefore they made so great haste / To whom he
ansuered. that shortly should be in Iherusalem the feast of the Exaltacyon of
the holy Cross / On which god had be crucyfyed /

And therefore they made them ready for to goo to the said solempnytee. Upon
that she demanded and inquired of them if they would take her in to their
company. To whom was answered ye / So that she had money for to pay the
Maronnar / She said that she had no thing / But if she went in to the
ship / And for her freyghte she said that should abandouned to him her body /
And this said. she required Zozimas that it should playse him that she should
tell no more / For the air and he were thereof enfected / Zozimas ansuered /
Ha my friend say hardely without hydynge any thing /

Then began she to recounte to Zozimas this that folowyth / When the young
man had herd all these words. he began to laughe and went his way /
Then she threw away her spyndle that she held / and went toward the
ship to saylle fourth with the other / Then saw she x. young men at
ry^age of the sea. after her Judgment good and honest / The other were then
goon to the ship / And she prayed them that she might goo with them in to
the ship And that they should not refuse her /

And by many lewd and foul words she mouyd them to laugh / The^e they took
her in to their ship / As towchynge the Insolences by her done in the said
ship. she would no more recounte to Zozimas / But prayed him that he would
be content with yt she had said. without to recyte and show any more /

She in like wise arrived in Iherusalem. was abandouned to all sin / And was
not oonly content to do sin with them of the ship but also with many other
pilgrims When the day of the feast of the holy Cross was come / She went
tofore the young pilgrims. for to excyte them to the sin of secherye / But
nevertheless she went with the other in to the church. for to worship and
adoure the Cross. And came unto the porche / Wenynge to enter in / And
notwythstondynge that she was borne with great pain unto the yate of the
church / Yet might she not entree / How well that all the other entered
lightly that would enter. But by the power of god which wythstode her. she was
reiecte and cast abacke from the yate / And first she supposid that the cause
why she might not entree. was by cause that she was feeble. as wymmen ben.
which be not so strong as men. Then she enforcyd her for to entree more
asprely thanne she did tofore / But all her enforce auaylled her not / For she
was often rejected and cast abacke / In such wise that her body was shouen and
bruised / Then she abode long tofore the gate / in beholdynge all the world
which entered in without any force or vyolence / And began to think that the
great multitude of sins which she hadd commysed and done. was the cause and
lettynge for which she might not entree / And then she began to wayle and
weep bytterly. and smote her breast with great contrycyon and dysplaysure of
her life / And beholdynge on high. she saw an image of the vyrgyne Marye^
which hadd borne the god of heaven and of earth / saying that for my horrible
sins which I have done and commysed. I am not worthy to behold oonly thyn
image / For thou art a vyrgyne tofore thy chyldynge and after / And therefore
it is no thing Just ne ryghtfull. that a poor and a lecherous detestable
make prayer unto the / Nevertheless by cause thou haste conceived and
engendered him that woll always call again synnars to penance / I byseche the
that it may playse to help to convert me to him / In gyuynge to me aid and
comfort for to entree in to his church / To the end that I may worship and
adoure his right worthy Cross / in which he shed his precious blood for to
Redeem me from the pains of hell /

Command blessed lady and vyrgygyne. that the yate be open to me / And I
promise to thy dear sone. which is my god. and to the also. that I shall never
return to sin / But Incontynente that I have adoured and worshipped this
precious Cross. I shall forsake all the world / She recited and told
ferdermore to the said Zozimas. that in contynent after her prayer made as
said is / She trusting in the grace of our lord Ihesu Christ and of his
blessed mother went to the yate / Where tofore she cowde not entree / And in
great fere. as half deed she entered lytly with out any dyffycultee / And after
came to the place where as was the right worthy Cross of our Savior / To
fore which she knelyd on her knees / ^ And in feruente devotion she adoured
like to other / And after came to the image of the virgyne Marye mother of god.
for to give thankynges to her the best wise she cowde. of that which by her
Intercessyon she had so great a pryuylege to worrhyppe his precious Cross /
In saying / O glorious virgyne Mary. glory be to god almighty. which by
thine worthy Intercessyons has wylled to Receive me sinful woman to mercy /
What ought I more to do thanne to accomplysshe that which I have promised /
And yet again I pray the that thou help me to conduyte me and set me in
the way of saluaco^n. for to the I yield me. as to her which may help and
socour me Anon she herd a voice which said to her / Woman pass over the
flom Iourdan / And thou shalt find there thine health and rest of thine
soul /

Inconcynent she prayed the blessed lady that she would be always helping at
her need / And so went from ye cytee / And in gooynge she found a man which
gaaf to her.iii. pens. with which she bought her three loves of bread / And
after asked of him that sold the bread: which was the way to goo to flom
Iourdan / And whan^e she knew the gate by which she should goo / All the
day she went weeping and waylynge / And from the hour of Tyerce unto the
hour of Syxte. and abowte the son gooynge down She went and arrived at a
church of saint Johan Baptyste by the said flom Iourdan / In to which
church she entered for to make her prayers^ The which accomplysshed she
descended in to ye flode aforsayd and wisshe her face and her body with the
holy water of ye said flom Iourdan And after that she had admynistred ye holy
sacrament of thaulter. she ete half a loof. and the same night she lay all
nakyd upon ye earth / On ye morn she made her prayer to ye glorious virgyn Mary
/ prayeng her that she would adresse her for to goo. where as should be good
for her health Fynably she was come to the place where as Zozimas had found
her /

And as she said she had been there forty year /

Zozimas ferthermore demanded and questioned of her what thing she had eten /
She answered. two looues and an half of bread / Which were bycomen as hard
as stones as soon as she was passed over the flom Iourdan /

Zozimas said to her / Haste thou thus passed thy life so long time without
pain or sykenesse / She ansueryd My fader I dare not tell the the perils
that I have endured / Zozimas said. Leave no thing. but say all /

Truly my fader said she I have be seuentene year that I had contynuelly
desire to ete and drink such mete / as I ete in the world / And by cause I
might not have it^ I was in so great heaviness that I might not endure it /
In like wise the flesshely thoughts and deuyllyssh songs came to my mind /
By the which I was gretely tormented / But Incontinent I wept and smote my
breast. in saying to fore mine eyes the promise that I hadd made to god and to
the blessed vyrgyne Marye /

When I departed from the church of Iherusalem / Pryncypally I came for
socour to the holy vyrgyne Marye And in weeping and lamenting I prayed her to
have consolacyon and comfort / Towchynge the flesshely temptacyons that came
so much tofore me that I can not express ne tell For they made me so
enflam^ed of my first sin. that I might not bear it / But when I was in
these passions. I fell down to the earth for to weep and waylle abundantly /
And in so dooynge I knew spyrytuelly that the blessed vyrgyn Marye which had
helped me came for to socoure me / And I never lift up mine eyes from the
earth till I was out of thise cursyd thoughts / In having always mine heart to
our lady. Tresorye of grace. comfortresse of desolate / And the very
adresseresse of them that been out of the way /

Zozimas after demanded of her. ^aste thou had no mete ne clothing. The holy
Egypcyen ansuered / I have eten the two loves and an half. as I have told /
And the resydue of the time I have ete herbs of the deserte By cause that my
clothing was all to torn and in pyeces. I have left them. and am all nakyd
/

Let us think here how many alte raco^ns. as well by raynes and great coldes.
as by extreme hetes of the son yt she endured / Think we also how many
carnal temptacyons she threw fro her / Which ben somoche dyffycyle to
overcome to them that have been accustomed therein more thanne any other
temptaco^n / After she said to Zozimas / Alas my friend I am nourysshed and
cladde only with the word of my god. which has done to me so many graces /
The which says. that one lives not oonly by bread. but also by his word.
which quykenyth more than ye bodily mete / Zozimas herynge yt she spoke of
holy Scripture said to her Mother haste thou learned the books of Moses / The
Psaulter. and other holy scripture /

She then smiling said to him Fader believe me certainly. that sith I passyd
the flom Iourdan. I saw never man living but the. ne other be of the
world / I never learned book Ne never herd the Psaulter radde ne songen / But
the word of god which has so great virtue has enformyd mine entendement /
And this suffiseth to the. that I have told to the And from hens forth pray
for me poor sinful lecherous woman /

And when she had said these words / Zozimas kneled down on his knees.
and began to say / Blessed be the oonly god that does things so
merueylous. and in so many persons Blessed be thou my god. which haste
showed to me the goods that thou do to them that dreden the. and keep all
thy commandments / Verily my god thou leuest never them yt sechen for to
serve the /

The good woman suffered him not to lie on the earth / But prayed him that he
would never show that she had said to man living / And after said to him / My
fader goo now forth on thy way in peace / And within a year herafter I shall
come again. and show me to the / If god give us the grace With this I pray
the to do that which I shall ordeyne /

By cause that in your monasterye when ye make your holy fastings. which is
called Lent / Your custom is to goo in to Deserte each by himself for to
keep his fasting. When that time shall come. thou shall not goo out of the
church. but keep the monasterye / Zozimas was more abashed thanne tofore. of
that she knew the rule of the monasterye / and began to cry O my god glory
be given to the / I know that thou gyuest more grace with out comparyson to
them that serve ye truly thanne they demand or ask / The holy Egypcyen
reprysed his word and said / Fader harken / For when thou would depart
from the monastery. Thou shalt not mow.

But the holy Thursdaye of Cene. thou shall take the precious body of our
lord Ihesu Christ. and his precious blood in like wise in an holy vessel and
shalt come to me on that other side of flom Iourdan. without to pass over /
And then by the grace and mercy of my god and of thine. I shall receive him
benygnely / For I never received him sith I was admynystred in the church of
saint Johan in Iherusalem / I pray the that thou despise not my request / But
do as I have said to the /

With this thou shalt say to John^ Abbot of thine monasterye: that there ben
some things to be corrected in his church and Abbaye the which I wol not
tell to the now / But nevertheless thou shalt aduertyse him to take heed to his
Relygyouses / These words said the good woman returned in to her cave and
dwelling place accustomed. The good Zozimas retornyng to his monastery. kyssed
ye ground where as she had markyd / In praysynge god / And said non thing
all that year of that he had seen / For by cause he durst no thing say /
He enterteyned with his brethern when they were returned from the Deserts
after their custom /

All the year syghed Zozimas. somoche desire had he that it were passyd
When the time was come that the brethern should depart. for to goo in to
Deserte. to make their fastings as they had been accustomyd / Zozimas was
taken with a fever / And therefore he abode in the monasterye /

Then^e he remembered that she had said to him. when he would have gone with
the other. he might not

The day of the Cene comen / And after that all the brethern were returned
from Deserts / Zozimas in obeyenge that which that the good lady saint Marye
Egypcyen had said to him / He took a chalys and the precious body and blood
of our Sauyoure Ihesu Christ / And after he put fygges and Dates in a little
panyer. and in a little pot. potage with water / And so went forth as he
had been cauz^e unto the rynage of the flom Iourdan / In abiding the good
woman Marye Egypcyen / And notwythstondyng that it was long ^^ she came thither
/ Yet Zozimas slepte not / Ferynge that she had been there tofore his coming
/

Wherefore he wept. and prayed god in saying / My god which haste wylled to
give to me the grace to se this holy woman / I byseche the that it may pleyse
the to grant to me again that I may yet ones se her / And in prayenge and
making his orysons. came to him a another fantasye / And after he said / Alas
what shall I do when she shall come / how shall she come over the River. Alas I
have no Boot to row her over / Alas that I am unhappy / And thus saying the
holy woman came and tarried on that other side of the flom Iourdan / When
Zozimas saw her he was replenisshed with Joy. and thanked god / Always
thinking how she might come over wychoute boot / And he beholdynge her what
she did. He saw her make the sign of the Cross upon the water / And after
she began to walk upon the water / In passing over as steadfastly as she
had walked upon dry land.

She being yet upon the water said to Zozimas / What do thou faint fader
which art priest and servant of god keeping the holy things /

And thus saying she came unto the other ryuage of ye flood. where as was the
holy man / Whom she salewed right humbly / Then he answered. I was so
admerueylled of this miracle that I was in manner of a aslepe / Now I know /
that always it is troth that god says. which has promised to them that
puryfye them by penance / That they ben agreeable to him

Alas I know now / how well I be less in perfecco^n thanne they that been in
this place / And I held me ye most perfyghte in my former monastery.

This done the holy Marye Egypcyen said to him that he should begin the
Symbol (Quicunque vult saluus esse) et cetera. After they said the orayson
Domynycall / That is to say the Pater noster / The which achyeued she kyssed
the holy fader Zozimas / And after received the holy sacrament of the altar
her maker and ^^res / And after lift up her hondes to heaven and said / O my
god suffer now thy hand maid and poor servant in peace after thy word /

For mine eyes has seen thy health.

After she said to Zozimas. Goo now in to thy monasterye. and live in peace with
god / And when this year shall be passed. thou shalt come again unto the
little Broke where I first spoke to the / And yet thou shalt see me again.
if it playse to my god / Zozimas answered / Would god that I might always be
with the /

My mother I pray the that thou mote ete a little of the mete that I have
brought to the / Then she took three graynes of his Le^tylle. and put it in
her mouth. saying / It suffyseth to have the grace of the holy ghost for to
sustain the soul vndefoylled of sin / Then said Zozimas pray for me /
And remember mine Infelycyte / Zozimas took her by the fete. in prayenge her
that she would have the state of the poor synnars and himself for recommended
/ These things thus done. the good woman made the sign of the Cross upon
flom Iourdan. and went upon the water as she did tofore / Zozimas dredefull
and Ioyeous returned again in to his monasterye / But he was dysplaysed by
cause he had not asked her name /

The year passed he came again in to the place before said / And byholdynge on
all sides if he might se her. But he cowde fyude none apparaunce nor
knowledge. And lyftynge up his eyes to henen made his prayer saying / O my
god playsyth it yt to show to me the Angel. to whom all the world is not
worthy to be compared or lykened / And these words thus proferred and vttred /
he saw over the said broke a clerenesse shynyng as the son / Under which
bryghtnes lay deed the body of the holy Egypcyen / Having the face toward
the Eest And her hondes Joined upon her breast / Then Zozimas aroos and
went unto the said body / By which he wept a long while / washing her
fete with his teeres without towchynge any other part of her body /

Thinking in himself that he was not worthy to towche her / But by the
prouydence of god he found a letter in which was wreton this that folowyth /

Fader Zozimas put in sepulture the poor body of Marye Egypcyen. To the end
that in so dooynge thou render to the earth that which is his / And poulder
to poulder / in prayenge god for my soul / Zozimas was much admerueylled. In
thinking how these lettres had been wreten / Nevertheless he rejoiced him of
that he knew her name / And praised and thankyd god. And dyssposyd him for to
make and begin to dygge a pytte or a Sepulture to burye her in / But for as
much as he had neither pykeys ne shouell for to make it / He found a little
bowhe. with which he began to delue in the earth / The which was so hard /
that he was a long space of time. without to make any thing. First he was
old and feeble Secondly the ground was hard.

Thyrdly he was strongely ennoyed and wept contynuelly / And in like wise
resystynge. he byhelde the corpse of the good Marye Egypcyen / He saw a
merueyllouse great Lion. which lycked the fete of the blessed corpse /

Then he was somewhat aferde / For never tofore had he seen such a beeste.
Also she had said to him that she had none seen in all the time that she
had been in deserte /

Then Zozimas blessed him with the sign of the cross. in beholdynge ye
said lion / Which made to him a sign of salutacyon / That seenge Zozimas
commanded him to make the sepulture for the good holy woman /

The which he did according to ye quantyte of her body / And after in way
lynges and wepynges Zozimas couerde the said body. which was all nakyd in
like wise as he had found it in the presence of the said lion / Which
anon after departed / And Zozimas returned in to his monastery. and recounted
and told to his brethern the caas in such wise as it happed / Wherefore they
were much admerueylled /

And after that time they solempnysed and worshypped the day of her departing
out of this world /

The Abbot Johan corrected them which had trespassed and sinned like as
saint Marye Egypcyen had said to the said Zozimas / The which lived in the
said monasterye unto the aege of an hundred years / After which time he deyed
in rest / And his soul went in to the glory of heaven /

To which he bring us that deyed on the Cross / Amen /

Thus endyth the life of the holy and blessed woman saint Marye Egypcyen /
And next folowyth the life of saint Maryne / Beginning in latin Fuit frater
quidam / et cetera Caplm.xliii.


Sometime a seculer man which had but one oonly daughter / whom he delyuerd
to govern to one of his fre^des / And after he put him self in relygyon /
where he did with a good will / all that thabbot commanded him / After that
he hadd be there a long space of time / he often remembryd his daughter /
insuche wise that he becam all melancolyus /

Thabbot seenge his courage changed / and that he was not so Joyous as he had
be accustomed / demanded him the cause of his heaviness /

Then he ansuerde in weeping / that he had left in the cite an oonly sone.
whom he much loved. and for that cause he was melancolyous / and also by
cause he wist not how he did / The abbot said to him / Goo and fetch him and
bring him hither to the end that he may duelle with the / And nevertheless the
said relygious had no sone. but oonly a daughter. as before is said / the
which had to name Maryne / but he would not tell so to the abbot / by cause
he hadd concluded to bring her in / in abyte dyssymyled / And went to the cite
/ which was dystant fro his monastery xxxii. mile or there about / And
brought his daughter clad like a man / and called her Maryn / In which estate
she was theryn unto the age of riu^^ year. and was suffycyently Instruct / as
well in letture as otherwise in the way of health / her fader showed her how
vyrgynyte was a fair estate much agreeable to god / In prayeng her right
affectuously to keep hit well / and that she should be ware and wise from the
grynnes of the fend.

And that she should never late be known that she was a woman / she comen to
the age of xvii. year / her fader deyed and departed out of the world.

After she becam much obeyssaunt to thabbot and to all them of the monastery
/ in such wise that she was merueyllously loved of thabbot and of all the
relygyous wenynge allewaye that she had be a man.

The said monastery had.ii. oxen and alytyll carte serving for the relygious
for to fetch their necessytees at the sea which was by them a three mile of.
On a time the abbot called Maryn / and asked him why he went not sometime like
as the other brethern did for to fetch vytayllys for the couente. Maryn
which was much oberssaunt went incontinent thither / Now it is to be noted
that on the way there was a man named Paudoux. in whose house the said Maryn
otherwhyle abode all night with his other brethern / When it was so late that
they might not return to the monastery. And hit happed that the daughter of
the said Paudoux was with child gotten by a man of war

The fader seyenge his daughter great with child began to repreue her angrely
and thretened her for to know who hadde-goten it /

Then by thynstruccyon of her love. ansuerde that Maryn the relygyous had
done it The fader then accompanied with his friends came to thabbot /
recou^ted to him ye caas. Whereof thabbot was gretely admerueylled And sent
anon for Maryn / And demanded of him if he had commysed this great sin /
Maryn began to weep and said Fader Abbot I have gretely sinned / the which
dyspleasyth me sore-Wherfore I pray you that ye will charge me with penance
such as ye shall think to be apperteynynge to the correccyon of my great
offense /

Thabbot in a great furye droof him out of ye monastery / to fore which
without entering in again she was by ye space of four year / lyeng under the
gate upon the bare ground / making there sharp penance for the sin which
she had not commysed / And when the brethern went for prouysyon of the
covent / she asked of them bread for the love of god and such penance she
endured by the space of iiii. year in which time she endured not oonly great
indigen^es / But also many rebukes and shames / as well of ye parente^ and
friends of the daughter which had leyde to by ye said caas / as of other
folk thither coming / which called her paper la^d and ypocryte And yet that
worse is / After that the said daughter had leyen in a certain time for to
no^^^ysshe her child whyth her pappes /

She brought the child to him sayenge^ hold Maryn take this child / and
nourysshe it like as thou haste made it. She received it benygnly / And two
year during she nourysshed it swetely with such as was given to hi^ for the
love of god / The relygyouse brethern seyeng her great pacyence and humylyte /
moeued with great pytee and compassyon prayde thabbot yt it would playse him in
preferrynge mercy tofore the rygour of Justice to call again brother Maryn /
which thing he would in no wise do / having allwaye against him merueyllous
indygnacyon because of the said trespaas / Fynably he being vaynquysshyd by
contynuel prayers of his brethern / called hy^ in again and said to him / Maryn
I have great conscience / seen the grant of thy sin / yet I admytte the
nevertheless to come in for to playse my brethern which have humbly prayde me
for the many times / I suffer that thou and thy miserable child which have
gotten in aduoultrye be lodged her wythyn as strange persons / And by cause
that thou art not worthy for to felawshyppe and commynyke with the brethern.
but in doing to them scruple like as the caas shall require / I ordeyne that
thou be allwaye subgette to make clean all the places of here within / and take
and here away the fylthe and unclean things / And also in like wise to fetch
water for to wasshe the pottes and disshes and to help the needs of the
brethern / The which penance she accepted with good will and good heart / and
so long she continued that ^he departed out of this world fro life to death /
This thing pronounced by the brethern to their abbot / Which said to them /
My brethern ye know well the enormyte of his sin of which he has not made
condygne penance /

And therefore it is not decent ne couenable that he be buried in our monastery
But nevertheless seen his obedyence / I am content that far in the manner
accustomed he buried by you out of the monastery / The brethern for to do that
which was permytted to them came in to the little chamber where he was deed /
And in dyspoyllynge and taking of his clothes for to ennoynte him / They knew
that she was a woman. And were merueylously abashed And began to waylle
bytterly with great abundaunce of teeres / And Incontinent camen and showed to
the abbot / Who for this thing was gretely ^oenyd. and towchyd of a
merueyllous contrycyon and dysplaysure / And tell there to the ground.
Smiting with his hondes against his breast and his heed saying / O glorious
Mary^e I byseche the that of the afflyccy^^s which I have given to the / that
thou accuse me not tofore god / For by ygnoraunce I have done it / Alas if thou
had told to me the troth / I had never commysed toward the this
merueyllous faw^e /

After that he had much lamented and waylled. he did do burye her
solempnly within the church of ye monasterye / And that same day came she
which had untruly accused her of the caas. for which she had done so
great penaunces / The which vexed and tormented of the devil confessyd openly
her sin / Declarynge the name of him which had gotten the child / All the
Relygyouses persons of the monasteryes nyghe by aduertysed of this mysterye /
In the honor of the glorious vyrgyn came to the monastery with their Crosses
and tapres light and brennynge / in syngyng ym^^^s and psalms / In praysynge
the name of god / To whom they thanked and rendered graces of that which had
playsed him for the edifycacyon of the yr souls to show to them this
merueyllous fayte. And after in the said monasterye were showed and done many
miracles by the prayers of the holy vyrgyne saint Maryne /

Thus endyth the life of saint Maryne /
The life of saint Eufrosyne / and begynnyth in latin Fuit vir. et cetera.

IN Alexandrye was a man named Pafunce much honorable. and keeping the
commandments of god / He took a wife which was of much honest life / As
she that was extracte of noble parents and virtuous / But she was barayn and
steryle. and much sorrowful. by cause she had no children ne lygnye / The
good Pafu^ce was much soroufull by cause he had no children / that might
succeed to his possessions / His wife hadd great solycytude to nourysshe the
poor people. She served god day and night. Contynuelly she prayed him. that
it might playse him to give her a child by generacyon. pryncypally by cause
that her husbonde was so dysplaysaunt that he might have none And he himself
semblably prayed / and forcyd hy^self to find some deuowte man that would
pray god for him that he might obtain his desire by the moyen of his
prayers. And to that end he enlarged to the poor great quantite of his goods
temporal /

On a time he entered in to a monastery where he found a good fader. loved of
god after the renom^e of the country for the contemplaco^n of whom. he
frequented in the said monastery diverse times. dooyng there his alms tofore
e^he declared his will and desire to the Abbot ne to the relygyouses Fynably he
said to them that he had all his life desired to have generacyon. but
nevertheless he cowde not have it / Thabbot and the relygyouses desiring to
help in his aduersytee. prayed god for hy^ in such wise. that by the will of
god he had a much fay^ daughter. the which after that she was.vii. years old
was baptized. and called Eufrosyne And when she was of.iii. year aege. her
mother departed out of this worlde^ leuyng her husbonde alive. the which
enfourmyd the said daughter as well in letture as in good manners / And in such
wise prouffyted. that not oonly her fader and her parents. but also all
thynhabitau^tes of the cite. or the most part merueylled them: and also of
her bodyly bewte So it happed that for her great virtues and perfeccions she
was of many desired in marriage. but al were forsaken except one. which passed
all other in richesse and in honors / In right young aege she was thereto
acorded /

When she was.xviii. year old. her fader ladd her to the monastery where he
had been accustomed to pray god. And there gaaf great quantyte of money / and
said to thabbot / Fader abbot loo here the fruit of thy prayer / Nevertheless I
am constrained to marye her I require the to pray for her / Thabbot admonested
her to live in honest. chastyte and pacye^ce. and also soueraynly to dread god
/ And she be^ynge in this monasterye. where she soiourned with her fader by the
space of three days began to have contemplaco^n in the good and honest
conuersacyon of the Relygyouses And thought in herself that well happy were
thise men relygyouses / which in this world were semblable to angellis. and
in the end of their life should deserve the glory eternell / The three days
passed Pafunce required at the abbot that he would give the benedyecyon to
his daughter. And they would return in to the cite / And thus saying she
kneled down on both her knees tofore him in saying / My fader I byseche the
yt it may playse the to pray for me. to the end that god woll save my poor
soul / Thise words said the Abbot laid his hand upon her The god that
knows the creatures tofore they were born bless the and make the to have
part in his Reame / After that time as often as her fader found any Relygyous
persone^ he lad him in to his house. And prayed him to pray for her /

The Abbot had a custom to make feeste and solempnytee the day that he was
Instituted Abbot of his monastery / That day coming he sent to the house of
Pafunce. for to pray him to come to that solempnytee / The relygyous that came
found not the say-Pafunce at home / But it was told him by his servants.
that he was gone out / Eufrosme that seenge called the Relygyous. and axyd of
him many things / First how many bredern were in his monastery / The
Relygyous said that there were three hundred and two and fyfty / After she axyd
if there were any dyffyculte to receive in to ye Relygyon of any that would
render hy^ Relygyous / To whom he answered that nay / Saying that our lord
god had said that who so ever would come to him. he would not cast him out
from him / Thyrdly she demanded if they song the psalms all together And
also how they fasted / He ansuered that eueryche fasted after his power / But
they song all together. And also she asked of all the rules of the said
monasterye / And he told all to her After she said to the said Relygyous
that her will was to lead the state and life of Relygyon / But she dradde much
to offend her fader. Which would do her to be married / The Relygyous said
to her / My sister delyuere not thy body to a man mortal. but to god which is
Inmortall give thy beaulte / And secretly take the habyte of a man / and make
thyselfe Relygyouse in some monastery. where some ever it be / Which thing
herynge the said daughter was greteli comforted and rejoiced / But
nevertheless she had in herself some heaviness / By cause that she cowde not
advise her by what moyen she might do and accomplysshe this thing / For she
durst not trust in any lay man / The Relygyouse said to her / Thy fader
shall be three or four days in the Abbaye / And therefore send for some deuowte
Relygyouse man / Which right gladly shall pourueye for thy caas /

And thus as they devised together. came her fader / Which demanded of the
Relygyous the cause of his coming thither / The which said to him that his
Abbot prayed him that it would playse him to come to the solempnytee of his
feast / Pafunce much Joyous of his coming went in to a ship with the
Relygyous. and came to the monasterye / Incontinent that they were departed /
Saint Eufrosyne desiring to accomplysshe and fuldoo her purpoos and entencyon.
sent for to seche a Relygyous of the monastery of ye Abbot Theodocyen / The
which being comen to her. she anon recyted to him. and told her caas and
entencyon / And that which she had enterprised to do and accomplysshe / And
then he herynge these fair and deuowte words said to her / My love and
friend god has taught us. that who that renou^cyth not fader and mother.
their children and theymselfe by their free will. is not worthy to be dyscyple
of our lord Ihesu Christ / And therefore I say if thou may. thou ought to
renounce thy parents and kinnesfolke. for to ensewe and follow Ihesu Christ /

Remember the not^ ne take no thought for the heritage of thy fader. for
there ^en ynow of poor wydowes and of poor monasteries. to whom he may
dystrybute and deal his goods / Saint Eufrosine ansuerd. I trust in god and^
in thy words / And pray the that thou wol^e pray for me / And that
Incontynente. thou cut of and take a way mine heeres / The Relygyouse his
oryson made in prayenge said /

Our lord god which has delivered from peril all his saints woll keep
and preserve the from all evil / Anon after he cut of her heeres / And
that done departed from thens. yeuynge praysinge to our lord god. and
considering in herself what she had to do for to entree in to the Relygyon
of wymmen. ^nowynge that her fader in seeking her might happily find her
there / And therefore in leuynge the habit of a woman cladde her with the
haby^e of a man / And after departed from the house of her fader. and went in
to the monasterye. thither as he was gone. And Incontinent that she knew that
her fader was departed She found the manner to speak with the Abbot / gyuynge
him to understand that she was a man that gladly would be there Relygious. and
named her self Smaradyn /

The Abbot received her gladly / and for as much as she semyd a child of
young aege. She was delivered to be endoctryned and taught in the rules of the
Relygyon to a another Relygious man. named Agapyton / She being there. by cause
she was much fair. and pryncypally of vysage / Many of the Relygiouses
began to murmr in saying / That it was a devil in likeness of a
Relygyous / And that by her beaulte many of them were fall in sin /

Fynably they said it to the Abbot / The which that knowing commanded to
Smaradyn. that he should make his prayers alone in his little chamber / And that
he should no more come in to the church / Which thing she did gladly and
held her there so solytaryly. that all the Relygiouses merueylled of the
great constaunce that she had in so young aege /

Her fader Pafunce returned fro the said monasterye / And when he was comen
home. he found naught his said daughter And anon was surprysed and taken of
a great and merueyllouse sorrow and heaviness. And began to ask all his
servants and chamberers where she was bycome. and whither she was goon / To
whom they ansuered that in the morning she departed out of the house as they
supposyd. for sith they had not seen her. ne knew not where she was bycome.
In contynent and without taryeng he sent his messagers to all parties. and
fro Relygion to Relygyon: as well in Alexandrye as in Egypt. But he cowde here
no tidings. whereof he was full of heaviness. and so right sorrowful that
uneath it may not be said. He made so lamentacyon and sorrow. that he said
these words / Alas my sweet d^ughter mine oonly consolacyon. and all the
playsaunce of mine eyes. Which is he that robbed and took the away from me /
And that has quenchyd my light and all mine hope / Alas now is defoylled the
beauty of thy face /

A cursyd be the wulfe that has borne away my sheep / Alas in what set or in
what land may she be hid O land hyde not from me my dou^ghter Eufrosyne.
But do so much that she may be rendered to me again Such words and other
much merueyllous and pyteuous said Pafunce. in wayllynge so moche^ that the
assystentes and dwellers of the city were excyted and styred to make
lamentacyon and cries / And after he returned to his holy Abbot. To whom in
weeping he declared the cause of his great sorrow and dyscomforte / To the end
that he and his Relygyouses should pray to god that he might have hasty and
shortly tidings of his daughter / And that they dysposyd them to fast and
make denowte orysons du^ynge an hoole weke / But nevertheless they herd of
her no manner tidings /

Saint Eufrosyne prayed in like wise to god. that never her conuersacyon should
be showed to man After came the Abbot to her fader Pafu^ce and said to him /
My sone rejoice the sith we have no reuelacyon of her / We believe steadfastly
that in what place yt ever thy daughter be. she is in the honor of god / And
has no dystrowblynge ne empeshement / That herynge Pafunce was a little
comforted / And after that he had thankyd the bredern he retornyd in to his
house /

Certain days after passed the said Pafunce retornyd in to the abbaye / And
recommau^ded him to the bredern In requyrynge them much humbly that they
should pray for him and for his daughter. And syngulerly to the abbot to him
saying. Alas good fader my sorrow renewyth from day to day more and more /
Truly I may no longer bear it without death /

The Abbot seenge that he was so much sorrowful. brought him in to the
chamber where as saint Eufrosyne was. not knowing that she was his daughter /
And called the Relygyouse that had the charge of her. named Agapyton /

Saint Eufrosyne herynge her fader was much abashed / And weeping with great
teeres began to comfort her the best she might. as she had not be of his
knowledge / Her fader beholdynge that her face was all covered with her habyte.
and gretely changed for her fastings and abstynences. which she continuelly
made. knew her not After the lamentacyons and wayllynges / saint Eufrosyne
began to speak to her fader. of the excellence of the glory eternal / And how
by abstynence. Charytee alms. Chastyte. and also in like wise by the virtue
of humylytee might begoten the sovereign be atytude or blessydnesse /

After she admonested him to despise and contempne all worldly things In
showing to him. that a man ought not so much love his children as god / But
by cause that she saw her fader in much great trybulacyon. she would comfort
him at last. and said to him. Know my friend for truth as I believe. that
thou art bylouyd of god / And that if thy daughter were in way of perdycyon
god would have showed in what estate she were in. I believe that she has
chosen the way of health / For he that forsakyth not all that he has. may
have no part in heaven / Leave then thy malencolye. and be not cause of thy
perdycyon and loss / Have pacyence and steadfast hope / I have herd often my
master Agapyton speak of the /

And how thou haste prayed the Relygyouses for to have tidings of thy
daughter. But I have often prayed to the end that thou sholdeste have pacyence.
And have desired for to see the for to comfort the. with the leest harm that
I might / And after the said to him / My lord and my friend goo thy way I
pray the / And notwythstondyng yt she desired him to goo his way.
Nevertheless she wept and had compassyon of him / For nature might not lie /

Pafuncyus her fader by her words / was much comforted / And nyghe as much
as he had found his daughter / After he recommaunded him to the prayers of
the Abbot and Covent / And returned home to his house / Saint Eufrosyne in the
habyte of a man lived eyghte and thyrty years And anon after cam^ to her a
sykenesse and maladye. of which she deyed / And dutynge the said maladye. her
fader came to the abbaye for to vysyte her / Notwythstondynge that he wend
always that she had been the Relygyouse Smaradyn / And entered in to the
chamber where she lay syke. and found her almoost deed / Then he began to
weep saying / Alas and what shall I do / Where ben the promyses which thou
haste made to me Smaradyn / Where ben the sweet consolacyons and the playsaunte
words. By which thou promysedest to me. that I should see my daughter. Alas I
have not oonly lost my daughter. But also I shall lose the. the which haste
given to me so much comfort / Alas who shall comfort my poor old aege.
and whyther shall I goo / Who shall be helping to me in my heaviness / Now am
I constrained to weep my dowble evil and harm of the and of my daughter / It
is eyghte and thyrty year goo sith I lost my daughter / Now I return in to
like sorrow. Alas where shall I now find consolacyon and comfort / I shall
descend weeping in to hell if god have not pity upon me /

Smaradyn seenge his heaviness had compassyon on him / And recomforted him
saying / Wherefore tormentest the thou thus / Wolte thou flee thyselfe / Ne
thynkesse not thou that god is almighty for to comfort the / Make an end of
thy heaviness /

Think how Jacob wept for his sone Joseph as deed / And yet after our lord
god showed him to him / I pray the for the honor of god. that thou leave me
not by the space of three days /

Then her fader Pafunce supposyd that the noble Relygyous Smaradyn without
fault should show to him some thing in some manner that he shall have
knowledge of his daughter /

The three days passed Incontinent came again Pafunce to Smaradyn / And said
thus My right sweet friend the three days ben now passed / I have tarried. like
as thou saydest to me /

Then saint Eufrosyne knowing that the day approchyd and drew nyghe in
which she should deye^ said to her fader / My lord and my friend I know
that I shall not live long And that god has helped me to fight against the
devil unto now / It restyth oonly that I give the consolacyon of thy daughter
Eufrosyne / Believe surely that I am she / And therefore be constaunt and mighty
without in any wise to anger the And this that I show to the. ne show ne
declare it to any man living / But thou allone tofore that I be putt in the
earth. shall wasshe me. To the end that no man know that I am a woman / I
have promised many lands and possessions to the church here within / And
therefore thou shalt accomplysshe and fulfill my promise. It is a place of
great devotion / Pray for me. I command the to god. and my body and my soul
/ And in saying these words she rendered and gaaf her spirit to god

When Pafunce the fader of the good lady had herd these words / seenge
that she was then deed. fell down to the earth as deed /

After this ran Agapytus. and he seenge that Smaradyn was deed. And Pafunce
fallen down to the earth. casted water in to the vysage of Pafunce. In saying
/ What eylest thou my lord and friend. Arise up / Pafunce ansuered. Alas
that I deye not right here / This day have I seen things enarrable / After he
roos up and fell upon the face of his daughter. and wysshe her with his teeres
/ And whan^e he had long waylled and wept upon the body / He said with an
high voice. Alas my sweet daughter. why haddeste not thou more sooner showed
and manyfested thyselfe to me. To the end that I had deyed gladly with yt
Unhappiness is comen to me. sith that^ thou haste hid thyselfe so long
from me. Alas how haste thou vaynquysshed and putt under thy fete. the
aduersytees of this world. And now thou art in eternal glory /

Agapyton that herynge went to the Abbot and showed him all the caas / When
the Abbot was comen / In like wise he began to weep with Pafunce in saying / O
Eufrosyne spowse of Ihesu Christ / The time is comen that thou ought to
remember thy brethern / Pray for us. to the end that we may come to the
port of health /

All the bredern there assembled and seenge this miracle. gloryfyed and
worshypped god in saying. Honor and praysynge be to god of heaven and of earth
/ Which that makyth not oonly to men merueyllouse things. but also to wymmen
/ And thus as all were there assembled for to burye the corpse / A brother
which had but one eye. kyssed her. And Incontinent he saw clerly with that
other eye /

Her fader dystrybuted and dealed al his possessions and lyuelood to the said
church and monastery. And rendered and became himself Relygyous in the same
place and monasterye / Where as he lived ten years after / And after his death
fynably was buried by saint Eufrosyne his oonly daughter. and sauyd in heaven /
To the whrche by their intercessyons and prayers it may playse god that we
may all come at the end of our days / The which grant us the fader.
sone. and holy ghost / Amen /

Thus endyth the life of the glorious saint Eufrosyne /
Of saint Frontynyan. Which begynnyth in latin Quomam sepe desideratis /
Caplm.xlv.
Saint Frontynyan being in the country of Nytrye. and with him three score and
ten brethren which ladde virtuous living. called all the said brethern /
And they being assembled and comen together / said to them / My brethern what
do we here in this dampnable world / I apperteyne now if we woll get the
heavenly life / It is of necessytee to renounce and forsake all worldly Joys /
Let us leave all and goo we in to deserte without to bear with us any thing
of the world / All they consented thereto / Some took of the seed of Cole
wortes and other herbs for to sow in Deserte / When they were there arrived
/ The good fader said to them / God has said in his gospel That no man
should think on such things as he should ete or drink /

Those ben the condycyons of them that lyuen in the world / Let us demand
and ask first the Reame of heaven / And let us do after Justice And by this
moyen all good things shall come to us / After that ever yche of them. after
his power intended to prayer the best wise they might. But the good fader
prayed not only for himself. but for all the other

Long time after that they had lived in the said Deserte / The enmye of
nature. which is always enuyouse / Pryncypally of them which done penance /
Tempted theym^ and assailed with many assaults / In such wise that he made
them all to murmr. and to grutche against their Abbot / And said that one
to that other / Wherefore is it that our Abbot has made us to come in to this
Deserte / They that been in towns and castellis: shall have as well heaven as
we. So that they done good works. And we slay ourselfe here by fastings. And
by abstynence we deyen for hungre / And thus the most part of them were
mouyd to return to the world /

This knowing saint Frontinyan came to them. and said / Wherefore alye my
bredern come ye hither with me for to murmr and grutche against god / Know
ye not well by holy scripture. that a Just man shall never deye for hungre /
And if he have not for to ete. God shall send him some by his angel. Like as
he has done to many of whom we read / Think that god has always his eye
upon the deuowte souls / Think also how god nouryssheth the rauen^s within
theye neest. when the fader ne the mother woll not nourysshe them by cause
they ben white / When they ben first hayghte or borne /

My brethern have ye always the love of god in your hertes. And I assure and
certefye you for truth. that ye shall never have defaulte of mete ne of
drink / And if it so happened / which I believe shall never come. that ye
should have hungre or thirst / And whan^e it so were / Then might ye have
cause to accuse god of the words that he has said in the gospel / thus
saying to him / O god we have kept thy commandments. And have byleuyd that
thou haste said. that is to wit that thou shalt nourysshe thy servants
with heavenly mete / We have had in ye hope. nevertheless thou haste left us /
But I pray you all ne murmr ne grutche no more thus in likewise as our
faders auncyente did in Deserte. when they were delivered from the hand of
king Pharao /

Abide ye. and tarry a while. And ye shall know how god pourneyth to them
that dredyth him and louyth him

After these words of saint Frontynyan all they ceaseden their murmuracyons
and grutchynges / And of that they had so done they were much sorrowful and
dysplaysaunte /

On a night after that they had so ben corrected / An angel apperyd to a
Rich man / And said thus to him / Thou man that lyuest in great delyces and
worldly playsures. and having habundaunce of goods. and the poor servants
of god ben in Deserte which have great hungre / I aduertyse and counseylle the
that thou arise up. And that thou send them some mete for to ete / Or ellis
thou shalt run in to the Indygnacyon of god / The man slepynge was gretely
admerueyled / On the morn erly he called together all his friends. and
recounted to them all that the angel had showed to him / But he knew no
thing in what place the holy faders were / Wherefore he cowde not do that the
angel had said to him /

On the morn he was yet again menaced thretened and beten by thangell / By
cause he had not accomplysshed and fulfilled his commandment In like wise
as he did tofore he did do assemble all his friends. for to have counseylle
how he might do that. which the angel had commanded him / In showing to
them the wounds that he had received of the angel / And notwythstondynge
none of them wyste not what to say / By cause they knew not the place where
the relygyous were in deserte /

Among the other there was one wise man. that counseylled him that he should
lade and charge three score and ten Camellis with vytaylle / And to let them
goo there as they would. without to be ladde ne conduyted of any person / For
if it were so that such reuelacyon came of a good angel. He should pourney
for them / And if it came of an evil angel. He should take it in pacyence /
This counseyle playsed to all them that were present / And it was so
executed in ladynge three score and five Camellis with vytayle for the
Relygyouses / And five other with vytaylle for the said Camellis /

After they were thus laden. he made his prayer to god thus saying / O my god
I require the. as Prouyder of all them that lyuen / That it may playse the to
adresse and to govern all these Camellis to go to the place where thy
servants ben / in such wise as it shall playse the / And also to bring them
home again. if it so playse the. without empesshement or lettynge in to mine
house /

Then he made them to depart without any person to goo with them for to
be their guide / And so they went alonge by a mountain by the space of four
days / And fynably came to the yate of their monasterye / And by cause that
they song their service. they might not here those said Camellis. ne their
great sownettes ne belles / ^auf oonly the Abbot. which was nyghe the gate /
Which was first aduysed and hadd knowledge of them to his great Joy and
exultacyon. By cause that god himself had purueyed to his needful petycyon
and prayer The said Abbot Frontynyan said no word unto the time that all the
seruyse was accomplysshed and ended / And after the end of the said seruyse.
he called togider all his brethern To whom he said / O my brethern where ben
now your murmuracyons and grutchynges / See ye now how god has sent
myraculously these Camellis laden with vytaylle /

All they together rendered and gaaf thankynges to god. In praysynge and
magnefyenge his name / And after dischargeden and vnloded the said Camellis^
and wysshe their fete / And that done. they gaaf to them to ete such mete as
they had brought with them / And with that also went to the mountain for
to fetch grass. for to Refresshe them more largely /

On the morrow the Abbot departed aile the vytaylles / And laid again on the
Camellis half their ladynge / To the end to eschew the sins that they
might commyse and do by over great habundaunce and plentee of those goods /
And sent them to him agaynt that had sent them / In prayenge to god /
that from all harm and evil he would keep them / and also their master and
lord /

Seven days after they of the house of the said rich man which had sent
forth the said Camellis / One of them herd the sownettis and bellis. and
sawenge them coming together. and And aduertysed and told the other /

Then all they all together went to mete them / And found them all
together all hoole / And not lener ne in worse point thanne they were at the
yt departing. for all their far and long Journey / The rich man which
tofore was heavy. doubting the loss of his Camellis. received them Ioyously.
In loving and praysynge the name of god /

And after that same time during the life of the said saint Frontynyan
continued to send to him often of his goods. as well for him as for his
Relygyouses. by which the said had no suffraunce of hungre. ne necessytee
of any thing /

And this thing happed the thyrtenth year of the Empire of Anthonye Emperor
of Rome / Saint Iherom says upon this paas / that who some ever shall do
alms unto the servants of god. And have toward them a pyteuous heart. In
enlargynge to them of his goods for their necessytees. He shall be rewarded
of god in this life or in everlasting life / The which give us the fader. the
sone and the holy ghost / Amen /

Thus endyth the life of saint Frontynyan. which was a deuowte and holy
Relygyous /
Here folowyth the life of saint Symeon heremyte / And begynnyth in latin
Sanctus Symeon. et cetera Caplm.xlvi.


Saint Symeon was not he ye received in the Temple our Sauyoure and redemer
Ihesu Christ. Forty days after he was borne. The which made the Psalm Nunc
dimittis / But this holy man of whom presentely we shall read. was hallowed of
god in his moders womb / He was swetely nourysshed of his parents and friends
/ And kept and drove the beestes of his fader unto thirtene years of his aege
/ Thnne it happed as he kept those beestes. that he apperreyued a church / In
to which he entered leuynge his beestes in the feldes /

And in that church then was radde the Epistle of saint Poul / Incontinent
saint Symeon a^yd an ancient man. what sygnefyed that. which was then radde
/ The which answered to him. that the epistle sygnefyed / How a man ought to
love and dread god with all his might and thought /

Saint Symeon asked what it was to lay to dread god / The said ancient man
answered to him / My sone why mockest thou me / The child ansuered to him / My
fader I ask the as him which may comfort me. I am as a ^ude ass and
ygnoraunt which knowyth no thing / And therefore I pray the that thou wolte
teache me in that which I shall demand and ask the The ancient fader in
heryng these words taught him in this manner and said.

My sone who someuer fastyth and mekyth himself in keeping the commaundementis
of god. forsakyth fader and mode^ friends. and all the goods of the world. In
following the doctrine of holy faders. he shall have for his heritage the reame
of heaven /

When the child herd these words he knelyd down tofore him saying / Thou
art my fader and my mother / And with this I take the for my Dyrectour of all
my works and operacyons / Thou haste this day sauyd my soule^ the which was
in the way of perdycyon. Now I shall goo in such wise as thou haste taught
me. Or god shall conduyte and led me / His will of me be done / Yet the good
fader enfourmyd him that he should have pacyence in aduersytee / And after this
the said Symeon went unto a monasterye. of a right perfyghte man. named
Thymothee. Tofore the yates of which monastery he tarried five days without
mete and without drink / After the said five days. the holy Abbot Thymothee
came out of the said monasterye. And found the child Symeon / And he asked
him of whens he was / And if he had done any harm. by cause he was fugy^yf /

Saint Symeon answered saying Sire I have not begyled ne trowbled my friends.
ne none other persons of the world. But I desire to be the servant of god.
if it playse him / To the end that I may save my soul the which is lost /

And therefore I pray the / that thou receive me in to thy monasterye for to
serve all the brethern therein.

Then the good Abbot took him by the hand. as he had known his great
devotion / And ladde him in to ye monasterye / saying to the relygiouses All
ye my brethern I deliver to you this child named Symeon. for to teache and
enfourme him in the Rules of our monasterye / And therefore I command you
that each of you be to him as his fader / For I believe that he shall be of the
nombre of perfyghte men /

The child Symeon served the said Relygyous by the space of four months /
In which four months he learned the Psaulter. In living allone spyrytuelly
/ For the refecco^n that he had with the Relygyouses. he gaaf it secretly to
the poor people / And notwythstondynge that the brethern took their refeccyon
always at even. saint Symeon took no thing but on the seventh day /

On a day among the other. he took the cord of the pytte. by which they
drew the water / and bound it on his bare flesh abowte his raynes and his
sholdres / And so fast he bound it abowte. that the cord entered with in his
flesh unto the bone / And for this cause his flesh roted. and was full of
vermyn The which fell from him in such wise as the good Symeon walked Now it
happed that the bredern knew that he ete not but from one son day to a another
/ And they found him gyuynge his porcyon to the poor people And so they
accused him to the Abbot saying That he brake the rules of the abbay / And
also that he was all enfecte. And they felt him much stynkynge / The Abbot
made him to come speak to him. In repreuynge him of his strayte life. By cause
he ete not every day ones like as he himself did / And there was no
dyscyple above his master / And after he made him to be dyspoylled / And
then they found how he was bound with a cord. And that it was the cause
why he stanke so / The Abbot was greatly abashed. and prayed him that he would
goo out of the monasterye. But first they took it from him with great pain
and smarte / And did do hele him / And that done he departed out of the
monasterye secretly / And went unto a deserte place. which was not far from
the said monasterye / Where he found a pytte. which was not vsyd / And in
which was no water / but there were therein evil spyrytes. The night
following was showed to the Abbot Thymothee. that many armyd people came for to
assyege ye house for to have the good servant of god Symeon / And if they would
not delyuere him / That they would thretene to brenne them and all their
monasterye /

When Thymothee was awakyd consyderyng this reuelacyon / And that he had
so blamyd the servant of god. was sore aferde. and recyted to his brethern
the said reuelacyon / And how he was therwyth sore trowblyd / The night
following came abowte the house much people. that cried with an high voice /
Thymothee deliver to us Symeon. He is better bylouyd with god thanne thou /
Wherefore haste thou trowbled him so hardely / All the heavenly court is
wroth with the / By cause for him god shall do merueyllous things / which
man never did / Incontynente Tymothee aroos. and went to his brethern.
commaudynge them that with our delay they should goo and find Symeon / or
ellis they were all in way to deye within their monasterye /

The brethern anon went out of their church for to go seche where they
might find the good Symeon / but they cowde not find him / Then they
returned to the Abbot saying. that they had serched over all sauf in the
pytte of the deserte / The abbot which of thise tidings was much dysplaysed.
took with him fine of his brethern. with whom he transported him unto the
said pytte. wherein the good Symeon was descended / And tofor ^r they would goo
down in that place. they made their prayers to god to have grace for to find
the good relygyous Symeon / And that he would keep them from Inconuenyent /
And that done they descended in to the pytt The holy man Symeon seenge them
there said to them / O ye servants of god / I pray you suffer ye me to
abide here. that I may yield my spyryte to god / For I have but a lytyl while
to live / And my soul is yet all greuyd of that I have enfecte your house /
The Abbot ansuerd / Certainly my friend we shall not leave the here / But thou
shalt come with us in to our monasterye / For we know that thou art louyd of
god / These words said they brought him would he or no into their church /
In which all they fell down to his fete. and cried him mercy of the offense
that they had done to him / Saint Symeon weeping said to them / Helas my
brethern ye grieve me to exalte me thus that am a poor synnar / And ye ben so
holy faders /

A year after dwelled saint Symeon in the said monasterye / And after he
departed secretly in to a solytary place Which was not far from the said
monasterye / And there edefyed a little cloysture of stones / And there dwelled
he three years / In that time began his fame to grow in the places nyghe unto
his habytacyon in which he dwelled after by the space of.xvi. years / Then
it happed that his said fame and renom^ee spradde over all the country / And
was so agreeable to the people. that they made to him two chyrches. in which
he dwelled yet by the space of four year / The which years passed. he di^e
many great miracles. In helynge by his prayers many that were dombe / Some
demonyakes. Blynde^ deyf. Lazars. and other sekenesses / Much people. as well
Sarrasyns as Persau^s. and of other far regyons herynge the bruyte of his
virtuous renommee camen to him / as well for to serve him and honor him / as
for to receive ye faith catholyke of hy^ He being in ye said place. ye devil
apered to hy^ in the form of a shynynge angel^ being in a charyot which was
co^duyted and ladde by ye strength of horses all enflamed. the which lyghted
al ye place. where as saint Symeon was / To whom ye devil began to say thise
words. Symeon take heed to yt which god sendith to ye by me / I am come hyder
for to ranyssh yt in this charyot / as was the good prophet Helye. Thy time is
comen / Come up with me her in / To the end that thou come in to paradyse /
Where as ben the angels accompanyenge the mother of god / the Appostles. and
all the heavenly court / And dyfferre it not / For I woll return to heaven /

Saint Symeon full of humylyte and prudence. that somewhat was disceyued made
his prayer to god in saying / Helas my Redemer. me that am a poor synnar.
Wylt thou rauysshe in to heaven And in saying these words. he lift up his
right foot and his hand also. for to mount and goo up in to the charyott
/ But first he made the sign of the Cross upon the said charyot / And
Incontinent it vanysshed all away / Where by he knew that it was the devil.
which would have disceyued him / Whereof he was much abashed / And by cause
that his right foot was over ready to ascend in the said charyot / He made
it to bear penance. For he was an hoole year upon a pyler having oonly one
foot on the earth / And there sustained him but one foot / There engendered a
postom in his leg. out of which fell down great multitude of vermyn. as well
upon the pyler. as upon the ground / Now he had with him a young discyple
named Anthonye. which after wrote his life. The which in obeyenge the
commandment of the said saint Symeon. gadred and took to him the said vermyn
that fill fro the said apostome / yt which he putting them in to the sore.
saying to them thexample of Job Take ye and ete that god has sent to you /
Bazylle king of the Sarrasy^s herynge the fame of his holy life transported
himself for to se him. And he being comen found him prayenge to god. But in
so dooynge fell down a worm from his sore upon the same king / The which
meuyd of a fervent devotion that he had to the holy man. took the same worm
and laid upon his eyes / Saint Symeon repreuynge him asked him wherefore he
had so do. saying to him yt it was no thing but a worm / To whom the
same king ansuered that it was no worm. but it was a precious stone / And
so it was verily / For by miracle. and by the great faith of the said king.
the said worm in his hand was converted in to a precious stone named
Margaryte And therewith departed the good king replenysshyd in good faith /
And took leave of the holy fader Symeon /

Long time after his mother herd tidings of him. And came to his church for
to se him / But by cause that wy^men never entered in where as he was / The good
holy man which had herd and well understand the voys of his mother. did do
say. and prayed her / that she would have a lytyl patience. and yt in short
time by ye playsur of god. they should each of them se other That seeng his
mother begun to weep sayng to hy^ / Helas my sone this is ye receyuyng and
reward that you do to me. for to have born yt in my beli. and have yeuen ye
sweet milk out of my pappes. and after so swetly have norisshed / Certain I
have done pore nourysshy^g. when instead to receive me. you yeuest to me
wepy^ge and wayly^ge / Helas who should not weep yt heryth her sone thus speak
to his mother / When the holy man herd the lamentacyons of his mother / He
began to weep as strongely as she did / And after he said to her swetely
without to see her face / My lady and my mother weep no more. For I promise you
that within short time we shall se each other / His mother not content of his
ansuere. prayed for to se him more tha^ tofore / saying / My sone I pray the
in the name of him that has formyd the. sith that I have be so long out of
thy presence. that now I may se the. or that I may more plainly here thy voys
/ or else I am deed / Think how thy fader is deed for love of the / Helas my
sone^ do not so that I deye in this heaviness / These words said. she slepte
as heavy and sore gryeuyd / For three days and three nights she had contynuelly
prayed for to se him / Then^e saint Symeon began to pray god for her / And
Incontinent she rendered up her soul to god That done the deed corpse was born
tofore the holy man / yt which made his prayer to god for her saying / My god
I pray the to take the soul of my good mother / the which has endured
somoche sorrow for me. and anon ye body of his mother began to move in the
presence of all the assystentis / And after saint Symeon made an other prayer
saying / My god which syttyst in trone above Cherubyns. and that see
clearly all things. unto thabbysmes and lowest places / And Adam tofore he was
born. which haste promised thy reame to them that love the. ye spakeste to
Moses in thenfla^med busshe. and gave thy benedycco^n to Abraham Which
put the souls of good persons in eternal glory and them of evil life in
perpetuell fire. And also that gave refecco^n to Helye by two crows Now
receive ye soul of my mother with the holy faders. like as only thou may
do. and none other / After this prayer accomplysshed. he ne lived but.xvi.
year / In ye time nyhe unto his monastery toward the parties of ye North
dwelled a dragon. which was so venomous. that there about as he was grew
no grass ne herb That dragon by caas of fortune or otherwise. was put in his
right eye a stake of a c^byte long / and so came tofore the place where as
the holy man was. And by a sign oonly yt the said Symeon made upon the said
dragon. the stake fell out of his eye / The relygiouses then being present
seeng this miracle. with drew them together to their monastery and gaaf
deuowtly thankynges to god

The said be thus guarisshed and helyd as said is wythdrewe him from them.
without dooynge any dysplaysure in any wise / And after yt all the brethern
relygyous were wythdrawen in to their church the same dragon fell down humbly
tofore ye door of the said church. for to give thanky^ges to ye holy man
Simeon of the good that he had done to him by his prayers /

In ye time a woman drinking out of a stone pot. received drynkyng in to her
body a little serpente. being in the same pot / Whereof she was so^ grievously
seek. that the Physicyens ne the Magycyens cowde find no remedy / Then was
she brought unto saint Symeon / The which Incontinent set her on the
ground / And without to give to her any medycyne made her to drink of the
water of his monastery / And as soon as she had drunken thereof / The serpente
sprange out or her body. as long as three cubytes or there abowtes / And the
woman was all hoole and guarysshed / And the same hour the said serpente
clefte asondre / And was hanged up in the same place by the space of seven
days for a perpetuell remembrance /

It was so that in the said place there was no water^ In such wise that not
oonly the men. but also the beestes ^eyed for thirst Then saint Symeon was
required to pray god that he would give to them water / And Incontinent the
ground opened. and cast out water habundantly / And after he did delue in
the said place to the depnesse of seven cubytes / And never after they faylled
water /

In that country there was a beeste named Parde / Of which be when the
lion had to do with her. he engendered on her. a another be called a
Leoparde / For the crueltee of that be durst no person goo thorugh the
feldes / That seenge the dwellars in that country. For to have aid and
comfort came to saint Symeon / The which commanded them that they should
sow and spring on the ground the water of their church. in the places where
as the said be haunted.

And so they did / And anon they were of him delivered. And anon after they
found the beast myraculously deed / Then they thanked god. In the name of
whom saint Symeon made so great and euydent miracles / And when he did any
on any person. he deffended them that he should never show any thing. but
only they should thank god. and noothynge him / Gyuyng to them to
understand. that god hadd helyd them. and not he / Above all things he
forbadde them that they should not swear the name of god / but oonly for Just
cause And for unjust they should swear by the name of Symeon the poor synnar
/ And saint Iherom says. that yet in the parties of the Eest and other
strange Regyons. they of the said parties and regions swear oonly and comynly
the name of saint Symeon /

A theyf named Ionathas for the great and myscheuous euyllis that he had
done. was so strongely chacyd that he was constrained to entree in to the
church of saint Symeon / And enbracyd a pylar by the which he stood / Saint
Symeon demanded him what he was / And wherefore he was there entered / To whom
he ansuered. I am Ionathas. which have done so much evil in the world. But
I woll repent me. and do penance / Then^e the holy man said to him / Thou
art right welcome my brother. for the penitentis is the reame of heaven / But
come not hither for to tempte me. ne also for to return to thy sin / And
thus saying came the officers of Anthyoche that said to saint Symeon / Deliver
to us the theyf Ionathas. or else all the cite shall arise and moeue them
against the. For the beestes ben red^ for to devour him / Saint Symeon
ansuered. My friends I have not brought him hither. It is a gretter master
thanne I And therefore if ye may take him with you / For as towchynge to me I
dare not towche him. by cause I dread god. which has sent him hither /
Then they retornyd and said to the lords of the Justice / where they had
fond him / and that which Symeon had said to them Wherefore they durst not
towche him / The theyf Ionathas which then^e was converted. and contynuenge in
lamentacyons and wepynges / After that he had been there seven days. in
holding the said pylar. said to saint Symeon / My lord and friend if it
playse the I am ready to goo hens /

Symeon ansuered / Art thou now weary to do penance. And wolt thou reto^ne to
thy malice accustomyd. Ionathas ansuered / Nay my lord I am not But the time
is come that I must deye / And in saying these words. he yielded up his
spurte to god. Then as they would have buried him came the Justices of
Anthyche. wenynge to have taken him / saint Symeon then ansuered. My friends
he that sent him hythe^ comyth to fetch him with all the celestyall cour^e.
The which may you and your cytee make to sink in to hell / And the poor
Ionathas theyf make to ascend in to heaven And know ye that I myself. if I
had known that god would not have be dysplaysed with me. I would have
delivered him to you / And therefore traueylle ye no more / The lords of the
Iustyse herynge these words returned again. And recounted and told all that
they had seen /

A little time after one named Anthony. Of whom is tofore spoken. and the
which had long served saint Symeon found him in prayer / And by cause he
had be so three days. that is to wit. the Frydaye. Saturday. and Sunday.
During the which he had not spoken. but was there as vnmoeuable / the good
relygyous Anthony was much abashed / And said to him. My lord and my fader.
it is time that thou arise / For it is three days now sythen the people have
tarried for to have thy blessing / To whom saint Symeon ansueryd no word /
Then said Anthony / Alas what may I have trespassed to the. that thou
spekest no thing to me / And seenge that he spoke not / He durst not awake
him / For he dradde him much / Nevertheless he abode by him by the space of
half an hour / And after he approchyd nere to him / And laid his ce^e to his
vysage. for to know if he were deed or a live / But he felt no thing but an
odoure so sweet that all the place was replenysshyd with all / Then^e knew he
well that he was departed out of this world / Then Incontinent he began to
kiss him. his eyes. his berde. Weeping bytterly. and said. Helas my lord and
my master Wherefore leuest thou me / Who shall be he that shall give to me
doctrine. as thou have done. What shall I say to the malades and seek people.
that shall come hither to have health / Helas now I see the. and tomorne I
shall lose the /

After many lamentacyons the good Anthony slepte / And as he slepte he be^de a
voice that said / Anthony I shall not leave the here in this place. ne in the
mountain in which I am Illumy^ed with the grace of god / Thou shalt goo
secretly in to Anthyoche / to the end that the people moeue them not / And
shall tell the tidings of my death / For now I am departed like as it has
playsed to my Redemer /

Thou shalt never cesse to pray god in this place here / And he shall reward
the in heaven / When Anthony was awaked. he merueylled much saying O my
lord and master. remember thou me in the glory in which thou art now After
he kissed his fete. and laid his hondes upon his eyes. saying / My lord I
pray the give to me thy blessing / And began again to weep saying / Helas
for to have my^de of the. What pyece of a Relic shall I take of thy body / And
so saying the body began to moeue. Wherefore he was affrayed that he durst
not towche it / And by cause none should know thereof / He sent secretly one
of his brethern to the Bishop of Anthyoche The which accompanied with two
other Bisshoppis and also with Ardahoruis Prince of the chyualrye of Anthyoche
transported them thither. and did lay the holy corpse tofore the altar of his
church /

And thystorye says that the birds fledden abowte the place where as he was.
making great cries and chaterynge in manner of wepinge and waylynges / The
people also and the beestes assembled in so great nombre. yt they were estemyd
well at seven thousand. demeanynge for his death a merueyllouse heaviness /
The mountains. the feldes. trees. and also herbs of the places nighe by
suffreden for his death / For over all there abowte they were enuyronned with
a derke cloud testefyenge and wytnessynge the bytternesse that they had.
Also the good Anthonye abode seven hours the angel of god. shynynge as a
lyghtnynge And his clothes white as snow With whom were seven ancient faders.
which long time were by the corpse / But what they did ne said. knows none
Like as says saint Iherom / During the time that the body was in ye church.
The Patryarke of Anthyoche would have taken of his berde. By cause he knew
that he was a man of holy life. But Incontinent thonde with which he would
have towched it. waxyd dry / But after by ye prayers of them that were
present and by the euydente miracle he was heelyd / Then^ swear he that
neither man ne woman should towche it / These things thus done in great
solempnyte. torches and tapres being light / The body was borne to Anthioche
/ But when he was withdrawn five mile to a place called Mere. might never man
make him depart from that place /

There was a man that had be forty year deyf and dombe. and began to cry /
Ha servant of god thou art right welcome / Thy coming has yeuen to me
heryng and speaking / I promise the if I live long^ that always I shall serve
the with body and soul / After he aroos and took one of the beestes that
ladde the corpse of the holy man / And anon he was helyd / The cause of the
accydente of this deyf and dombe man was this / He had been amerous of a fair
young woman married. the which he had strongely solycited for to have her
company. To the which he cowde not come / And after it happed that she deyed.
which death came to the knowledge of this man all enraged for her love / And
after yt she was buried. he went to her sepulture. and there deffoyled her.
And forthwyth he was deyf dombe. and lame / and so abode in the same place
during forty year / All the cyteyzyns of Anthioche came in great tryumphe. and
mete with the body. and bare it in to the great church / And there in the
church. which is named Penytence. in the which after his buryenge. to the
exaltaco^n of his glorious name ben showed and done Infenyte miracles / And
more merueylous than the^ that have be done in his life / Many princes and
lords have laid out of their tresours to the laid church for to have of him
some relyke. But none might ^e had be cause of the oath that the bysshopp made
/ that his body should never be towchyd Of saint Symeon believe ye steadfastly.
that who someuer for the honor of god and of him shall have the life of hy^ by
writing. and shall read it deuowtly. and serving him with good devotion. He
shall be rewarded for his merytes in the celestyall glory. To the which by
his Int^essions. let us prays almighty god. that we may obtain / Amen /

Of saint Eufraxe vyrgyn / Which begynnyth in latin In diebus theodo^u /
Caplm.xlvii.


IN the time that reigned Theodocyen the Just emperor of ye Romans. There was
at Rome a Senatoure named Antigonius the which had a daughter named Eufrare /
The said Antigonius was a man so prudent and of so god^ counseylle. that he
governed after the law of the Romans all the country of ^^^ye / He was so
much humayn that he had compassion of each person and admynystred to the
poor all they^ necessytees / The emperor louyd him not oonly by cause he was
his kysnesman^ but also by cause he was of right good and prouffytable
cou^seylle / He h^ bounded in richesse and goods temporal asmoche as any man
of the cite / And he had a wife descended of the propre and very lygnage of
Emperors the which also was called Eufraxe a woman Just and mercyful. and
garnysshyd with all other virtues / Antigonius after then certain time that
god had sent him his fair daughter Eufraxe. Thinking the salvation of his
soul / Devised with his wife Eufraxe of holy words and deuowte / And among
all other he said to her / Eufraxe my sister and love thou knoweste that this
life is transitory. and may no longer dure thanne four score year / Thou
knoweste also that the worldly rychesses. and the vanytee of this world arn
no thing but a little wind / But the rychesses of heaven ben always durable
and perpetuel / Now my sister thou ought to know. that all they that louen
dysordynatly the honors of this world. ben pryued from the goods of heaven /
And often the richesse and worldly possessions ben cause of the confusyon. and
utterly dystruccyon of them yt have them / His wife herynge these words said
to him / What playsyth yt that we do / Command thy good playsure and I shall
accomplysshe it For thy will is mine. That which thou wolte. I woll /
Antigonius ansueryd We have a daughter god be thankyd / And we ought to be
content that one with that other without to have affectyon to live emonge the
voluptuosytees of this world / Then his wife lyfted up her hondes to heaven
in saying / O my lord and love blessed be our lord that has made ye worthy
to know thine health / Truly my love I have many times prayed god / that he
would humble the. and torn thine entendemente to will to flee thy flesshely
co^cupyscences and worldly / But I never durst declare to the any thing
thereof. for ye great fere and good love that I had to the / And for asmoche as
thy will is such / Let us depart of our temporell goods to the end that
they be not cause to make us descend in to hell / Other holsom reasons. the
lady gaaf to Antigonius her husbond. the which hereof praysynge. and thanking
god with all his heart. Dystrybuted the gretest part of his goods to the
poor people / And after lived not but one year with his good life holy and
virtuous in perfyghte deuocyon^ chastytee and contynence /

Of his death was much sorrowful the emperor. which was of his kyn^e and
also all the Romans for the great virtues that were in him / And also for the
pity that they hadd of his wife Eufraxe. which had not b^ but.ij. and iij
months with him / After that he was buried. the good lady Eufraxe took her
daughter also named Eufraxe And presented her to the Emperor. and to her
friends. saying. O sovereign emperor. and ye all my lords and friends I put
in to your hondes this poor Orphelyne. Humbly you supplyenge. yt in favor
and contemplacyon of the good and very love that ye had to her fader
Antigonius. it would playse you to do her to be Instruct and taught in good
manners and virtues. And to be to her good faders and conduytours / The lords
herynge this pyteuous request. were in contynent moeuyd to weeping and
waylynge / And a little after that they had resprysed their spyrytes. the
emperor desired and counseylled the good lady that she should consent to the
marriage of her fair daughter / and of one of the Senators the rychest of all
the other / To the which she accorded / And the said daughter received ernest
of the marriage / But after by cause that the said daughter at that time that
the said Marriage was treated / was but five year old / And that the senatoure
was greuyd to abide till that she were suffysaunte of aege. for to accomplysshe
the said marriage / He concluded to demand the mother to his wife / And for to
come to his entencyon / He sent notable ladies to the Emperesse for to labor
that the mother would take to husbonde the said Senator / The which thing
the said Emperesse and the said ladies supposyd to have made and
accomplysshed it But the good lady wydowe would never in that manner leave her
^e^e to here it / But repre^yd them angrely. In showing to them the great
Inconuenyent in which they would bring her That is to wit in desiring her
to leave the way of health. for to take ye worldely way. for to bring her to
eternal dampnacyon / And emonge other words she said to the emperesse / A
madame. to what thing woll ye Induce me. Alas when I was with my husbonde
that was. I kept chastytee. And ye labor to me that I should follow ye
amorouse wymmen. I shall never do it / The emperor induertysed of the
enterprise of his wife. was evil contentent with her. saying these words
Come hither my wife. ye be well presumptuous to woll break the marriage which
has be so honestely begone Ne know ye not that our cosyn and kynnes woman
Eufraxe woll led a solytary life / Have ye now forgoten ye love that ye had to
her husbonde when he lived / Woll ye now do him Iniurye / Alas if ye have
louyd him while he lyned. ye ought after his death to love his wife. which is
so good and Just / The emperesse herynge these words was so much trowbled.
that she was two hours without speaking. and semyd to be deed / The good
Eufraxe knowing these tidings / was in like wise wroth. Doubting that it
should be laid to her. that she should be cause of the dyscencyon of the
emperor and of his wife. in such wise that she might be in danger of death
And in waylynge and weeping she said to her daughter Let us goo in to Egypt
my dear daughter. we have there many lands and possessions. which I shall
leave unto the. For all that I have is thine / And so they went in to the
land of Egypt / They ^eynge there arrived. vysyted her lands and
possessions. And fynably came in to ye parties of Thebayde. where they did
many almesses to the monasteries and relygyons / And emonge all other they came
to a Relygyon of wymmen in a town wherein were an hundred and th^^ty
monasteryes of relygyouses / There some ete no apples ne fygges. ne dra^ke no
wine. The other ete no oil ne other lycour. Other fasted an hole day Other
wysshe no fete / And when any spoke to them they were abashed They lay on
the earth. and ware every day the heyt / And if by adventure one of them were
syke / there was no medycyne given to her. But the sykenesse that she had.
was reputed for a benedycco^n of god. They went never out of the monasterye.
but they had a Portiere. the which gaaf ansuere to all them that came
thither /

Eufraxe knowing the honest and deuowte conuersacyon of the said Relygyouses
vysyted them often. And gave them light to the church. for to do the service
of god /

On one day emonge the other Eufraxe spoke to thabbesse. and to the
pry^cypallis of the monasterye. And said to them / My good ladies I woll give
to you twenty or thyrty pound of gold of revenue. for and to the end. that
it would playse you to pray god for Antigonius and his daughter. the which I
present you tofore your faces /

The Abbess ansuerd / My dear and right playsaunt lady. your servants have
no need of your rentes and revenues / For for to despise worldly goods they
have put theymselfe in to this monasterye. and woll be poor in this world for
to be rich in that other /

But to the end that ye be the more content. we pray you that it may playse
you to give to us some oylle and candellis for to accomplisshe the seruyse of
god. And that shall comfort us more than other goods / Thus did Eufraxe. in
prayenge them humbly that they would pray deuowtly for her husbonde and her
daughter /

On a day it happed as the good mother brought her daughter with her in to the
abbaye / The Abbess for to know the will that the little daughter Eufraxe
had. asked her first if she louyd their monasterye / The daughter ansueryd
that ye. and all the sisters in like wise / The Abbess after said to her in
manner / for to pass the time. My love sith that ye love us well Woll ye dwell
with us for to serve god The child ansuered. that if it were not for dread of
her mother. she would never depart from them / Yet again the Abbess said to
her / My daughter whom love you better your husbonde or us / She ansuered. I
knew him never. ne he me. But I know you and love you. And ye whom love ye
best of us. or him or me / And they ansueryd / that they louyd best god their
maker. The maid ansueryd. Certainly I love you and god also / The good mother
hering the daughter / which ansueryd so prudentely. seen that she was not yet
seven years old. fell in to weeping of great habundaunce of teeres / And after
said to her daughter. Come now hither my daughter it is time that we return
home to our house For it is nyghe even and late / The child ansuered that she
would abide with the Abbess. To whom the Abbess said. that she might not
dwell there in their monastery / but if she auowed her to Ihesu Christ / The
maid then^e asked her where is Ihesu Christ. The Abbess showed to her. the
image of ye Crucifyxe The maid Incontinent went and kyssed the same image.
and said to the Abbess / Certainly madame I give myself to my Sauyoure Ihesu
Christ / The Abbess said after to her. that she had no place for her. ne
wyste not where to put her /

The child ansuered that she would abide with her / When the Abbess saw
that she was so constaunt she knew well that she was espyted with the holy
ghost. And said to her mother / That she should leave her there in the said
monastery.

The mother being strongely comforted in her spyryte. took her daughter And
ladde her before thymage of Ihesu Christ / Tofore which she made her prayers.
in saying / Looued and thankyd be thou my god. for as much as it has playsed
the to enspire my daughter. In gyuynge to her such affection / that she has
given herself to the in her yongthe / Alas my god take the charge of her body
and of her soul sith that she desyryth to serve the / After she turned her
toward her daughter and said to her / My dear daughter. god which has made
the mountains vnmoeuable. make the so ferme in his love. that the world have
never power to moeue the / And when she had said these words. she delivered
her in to the hondes of the Abbess / In weeping and wayllynge so habundantely
/ that all the Relygyouses wept with her /

The day foloweng the Abbess clothed her with the vestyment of the Relygyon /
And prayed our lord for her saying / O king of kings which haste begone
so great a work in this child / I byseche the mekely that it may playse
the. that this beginning may achyeue fro good to better / to the end that
always she may praise. and gloryfye thy right holy name /

The mother then being by the daughter asked her in saying / My child love
thou well this vesture which thou haste now / The child ansueryd. Truly
mother ye / I believe that the vestymentes and clothing of this Relygyon. ben to
me the erneste penny for to have god in marriage / Then said the mother / I
pray to him that thou now haste chosen to thine espowse. that he make the
worthy to be chamberer in his heavenly chamber / These words said. the good
mother took leave of the Religyouses and kyssed her daughter. And returned home
to her house /

Thorugh all the land were the tidings. How the said good mother distrybuted
her goods unto poor people and to chyrches / And also the tidings came to
the Emperor and to all the Senators / The which were much Ioyouse of her
virtuous conversation / Every day she ete but cole wortes or pe^e potage. and
but one time on the day. And drank no wine /

A little while after the Abbess saw in spyryte. how Antigonius husbonde of
ye same good widow prayed god that she might depart out of this world. for
to be with him in heaven / And she showed it to the good Eufraxe / The which
was thereby greatly comforted / And putt herself to prayer / And she had like
reuelaco^n / And then she took all her goodes^ and put them in the hondes
of her daughter / for to dyspose in such wise yt she might get everlasting
rent / After she said to her how our Savior Ihesu Christ hadd called her
for to goo to her husbonde in heaven / The good daughter began to weep
sorowfully in saying / Allas what shall I do that shall be now an Orphelyne
stranger Her mother comforted her and said / My daughter thou art with thy
Ihesu Christ / Thou art no stranger to him / Also thou haste thine Abbess.
Which shall be to the a mother / By which thou shalt be none Orphelyne It
byhouyth to my love to dread god and honor him / And worship all the
systers. In serving them benyngnely / And thou shalt accomplysshe and
perform that which thou haste bygonne / I pray the that thou think not on
thy temporell noblesse. And esteem nor think not that they. shall do to the
any seruyse / Be poor and humble in this world / And thou shall be Rich and
a great lady in heaven.

Thou shalt give all our possessions to the church for thy fader and for us
tweyne / To the end that we may have mercy tofore god /

The third day after deyed the good mother. And was buried in the monasterye
where as her daughter was.

The Emperor had tidings thereof / And called the Senatoure that had
promised to take the young daughter Eufraxe / And said to him that she was a
Relygyous / Then the Senator was much abashed thereof And did do so
much. that at his Request and desire. the Emperor wrote to her. that she
should come to Rome for to accomplysshe and fulfill their marriage.

The lettres being by her radde. she ansuered in this manner / Lord Emperor
I have received thy lettres / and me semyth that seen the love that in time
passed thou haste hadd to my fader and mother. If I should of the demand and
ask counseylle of the thing of which thou haste written to me. Thou woldeste
not counseylle me so to do. For also it is not lawful. Sith that long agoon
I have given myself to my god Inmortall Ihesu Christ and desire to be his
spowse. Whereof I have given to him my faith. Should I give him over for to
have a man mortal and Incorruptyble. the which shall be eten with worms / Ne
know thou not well. that if I be here this day. I shall not so to morrow.
God forbede that I should do to god and to me such Innyquyte and wickedness /
Wherefore I pray the that thou send no more for me / For thou shalt lose thy
traueylle and labor. By cause that I know to be to me inpossyble to leave my
espowse Ihesu Christ /

With this I pray the that thou have mind of my parents and kynnesfolke / In
giuynge for the health of their souls. and for the honor of god all the
goods temporell which they have left to me / I know well that my fader all
his life has well and truly served the. Whereof he accepted thy love and
benyuolence Then in distrybutynge his goods thou shall have remembrance of
him. In favor of whom if it playse the And I pray the also. that thou wolt
put all thy bond men and prisoners in fraunchyse and plain lyberte / And
that ye thou wol send for all the Receyuours of my fader / And quyte and
forgive them peasibly all that they owen of rentes and Revenues /

To the end that I may without solicytude or business serve my god and
espowse / The emperor radde these lettres many times and al most all the
night / And on the morn by times he assembled all the Senatoures And the
fader of him that had fyauncyd her. And in the presence of them all were
the lettres radde / Whereof all they began to weep for Joy And of common
assente they said. Verily lord Emperor. Eufraxe is daughter of Antigonius.
and of holy Eufraxe her mother / Which weren of thy lygnage and generacyon. And
now she shewyth it well certainly. For of an holy Rote procedyth and comyth
fourth gladly an holy branch.

All they praysyd and gloryfyed god in prayenge for her / And after the
Emperor dystrybuted all the gods of the maiden. according to that she
had written. And after the Emperor deyed. and was buried with his parents
and kynnesmen /

Saint Eufra^e then ladde a much strayte life. For at one time was that she
ete but ones on the day / And after she constrained herself to ete but ones
in two days And after that ones in three days / She allone made clean the
chambres of the systers / Made their beds. And bare water in to the kechyn /

The custom of the same Abbaye was if any of the systers were tempted with any
temptacyon of the devil. she told it to the Abbess The which prayed and
did do pray god. to the end that the devil should depart fro her /

On a day it happed that the good Eufraxe was tempted of the fend / And for
to resyste and wythstonde him. She putt ashes on her cowche / And she lay on
them. and slepte / The which thing seenge the Abbess. knew that she was
vexed with some temptacyon / And prayed for her. in saying to god / O my god
which haste created and formyd this maid after thy dyuyne bountee and
goodness / I pray the that thou wolt conferme her in thy dread /

After the Abbess called her and said to her / Wherefore haste thou not showed
to me thy temptacion given to the by the devil / Incontinent she fell down
to her fete. And cried her mercy In sayenge^ Pardonne me madame. For I durst
not notyfye and show it to you / The Abbess said to her Mi daughter thou
haste begone to fight against the devil / Be strong and co^staunte. to the
end that thou be crowned with Laureo^ with the vyrgynes gloryously.

A little while after she was again tempted / And showed her temptacyon to out
of her systers named Iulyan / ye which counseyllyd her. that she should show
it to the Abbess. to the end that she should pray for her / After she said
to her / We all ben tempted of the devil / But when we have good hope. we
overcome the devil our temptatour / Eufraxe thankyd her of her good counseylle
that she had given to her. to the edyfycacyon of her soul and went to the
Abbess. And showed to her her temptacyon.

The Abbess comforted her in saying / My daughter fere the no thing but
enforce and put thyself to wythstonde him / For it is the devil. which does
this evil / And if thou wythsto^de him constantly and steadfastly / thou shalt
overcome him always /

Know thou my daughter. that thou shalt have many other temptacyons / for to
resyste and wythstonde. To which if thou feel the feeble of spyryte. It
behouyth the to do more abstynence. thanne thou haste done here tofore / And
in so dooynge thou shalt be right well beloved of thy spowse Ihesu christ /

A another time the Abbess asked her how long it was sith she ete any mete She
ansuered. three days / Then said the Abbess to her. That she should yet
abide a another day or that she should ete / The which she did with a good
will in rendrynge herself ready and prompte in obedyence / When she was
twenty years old. like as her years grew. so she augmented and encreacyd her
penance / She was fair and curteyes / By her manner she showed euydently that
she was descended of noble folk / But that notwythstondynge she was humble and
obeyssaunt In a place of their monastery was a great multitude of stones / And
the Abbess for to prove her humylyte commanded her that she bear them unto
an even. by ye church which was far from the place where as the said
stones lay / Emonge the same stones there were great. and so heavy / That two
of the Relygyouses. with great pain should have borne them / Nevertheless
without murmr and grutchynge. and without calling any help / And also
notwythstondynge that she had long fasted / she bare them all. desiring
to obey to her abbess / A another day she said to her / My daughter these
stones that thou haste borne nyghe to the church ben not well there Wherefore
thou must bear them unto the place where as thou haste taken them To which
thing she gladly and with good will accorded And thabbesse made her to do
this penance by the space of twenty days for to prove her pacyence / Which
was so great that all the systers merueylled thereof /

Some of them mocked her. And other admonested and styred her to persevere and
increase in virtues / She continued this penance unto thyrty days. And yet
cessed not the Abbess. And she seenge her great humylyte said to her. that
should return and here no more those stones / saying / Leave this craft my
daughter. and take mele and make thereof bread. and bake it in the oven. to the
end that thou serve thy systers. Wyche she did with good courage.

On a day the devil found her slepynge. And he put this temptacyon in her
mind / That the Senator of Rome. which had promised to have her. should come
with a great multitude of men of arms for to take her out from her monastery /
Whereof it happed. that she being in her bed began to cry with an high voice
so sharply. that all her systers awoke / For which cause they came to her.
And awoke her / Demau^dynge and questyonyng whereof proceeded the cause of the
great cry that she made Eufraxe then^e recyted Incontinent her dreme / And
then all her systers put them self to prayer for to pray god for her /
Now let us think what systerhede was there / In so much that they ne louyd.
not oonly together corporally / But more wythonte comparyson spyrytuell /

Yet again the devil tempted her / And gaaf to her assault of her flesh /
And Incontinent she showed it to ye Abbess. and to her sister Iulyan /

Which comforted her. and prayed for her / And after said to her sister / My
love it behouyth the to resyste and with slonde otherwise. Or ellis thou shalt
lose all the merit that thou haste gotten / Also if we resyste and wythstonde
not in our yongthe / How may we resyste in our aege / Eufraxe ansueryd to
the Abbess / Madame if it playse you to command me. that I fast an hoole
weke. to the end that I may overcome the tend with the help of god. I w^ll
do it with a good will.

Julian said to her / My love it thou may do that. Thou shalt ^e well
happy For in all out Relygyon none of our systers may do it. ^auf ^^nly
our Abbess / Then Eufraxe demanded ly^ence of the Abbess. for to fast an
hoole weke. To whom ye Abbess ansuered. That she should do after her power /
And that it should well playse to her. In saying My ^one god which has
created and fourmed the conferme the in thy good will

After that time Eufraxe ete but ones in the wyke / And nevertheless she left
not to apoynt the chambres. ne to sing and do the dyuyne service /

Ne in like wise to serve all the systers like as she had been accustomyd. as
tofore is said /

When her systers knew her great humylyte. And considering that she was of
the lygnage of the Emperor of Rome. They praised and honored her more thanne
tofore / And prayed god for her. to the end that she might persevere and
continue Emonge the other Relygyouses there was one which was amorous. The
which as the evil pryckynges of the enmye have more envy on the good manners
thanne of their semblable or like. Not for to take good ensample. but for to
find if they might find occasyon for to sklaundre them / Found Eufraxe in
the kechyn / and secretly said to her. Come hither my sister I merueylle me
of the how thou may fast all she weke like as does our Abbess / And I
doubt me sore that our Abbess command us to fast like as thou do /
Eufraxe ansuered to her humble saying to her / My sister doubt ^^ fer^ye not
for our Abbess shall commau^de us no thing. but that we may well do / But
know ye that I do that which is to me necessary for to resyste and
wythstonde the temptacyons of ye devil. which comen to me.

Germayne ^erynge her answer / And wenynge for to make her leave be fastings /
Said to her In^^ryously and wrongefully. I know well wherefore thou do so
much fasting. It is to the end that after our Abbess shall be deed / That
thou would be our abbess. Then saint Eufraxe not willing to excuse her
of that. that the forsayde Germayne Imposyd to her / but knelyd down on her
knees tofore her. and cried her mercy / In prayenge her to pray god for her /
The Abbess which was aduertysed and hadd knowledge by them that Germayne hadd
told it to. Sent for her to fore all her systers / And said to her / O
cursyd servant full of envy. what greuyth the this maid Eufraxe / Wherefore
wolte thou wythdrawe her from penance / I assure the that thou shalt be no
more with the systers. Thou art not worthy to be in their company. But thou
shall live alone as one that is excomyned or acursyd /

Saint Eufraxe then knelyd down on her knees tofor the Abbess. in
demanding and requyringe pardonne for the same Germayne / But not for all
that. the Abbess would not pardon^e her / And was so thyrty day in ye same
penance The thyrty day Eufraxe and her sister famylyer Iulyan came again to
pray the Abbess. for to have pardonne for Germayne /

Then she was sent fore. and corrected. And at the request and petr^o^n
of her systers was put again in their company / The devil more and more
enforcyd him to make the good Eufraxe to fall in to sin / And wenynge to
make an end of her / On a time as she drew water out of a pytt The devil
took her and threw her in to the pytte. In such wise that her heed towchyd
the bottom / After she came up on the water. And with her bond caughte the
cord / And began to cry in saying / O my god help me / Thabbesse and the
sisters ran thither. And drew her out of the pytte When she was out of
the pytte. she began to laughe in saying O my god blessed might thou be.
which haste given to me strength and courage to withstonde the temptacyon of
the devil. which so much enforcyth hy^ to overcome me / All the time
passyd here tofor I have born but one pott to the water / But from hensforth in
dyspyte of him. I shall bear tweyne. and so she did /

The devil seeng that he cowde not make her to deye by sin / Supposyd often
to slay her / and make her to deye bodyly / On a time as she hew wode for the
kechyn / The devil took and held her arm in such a manner. yt wha^ she
supposyd to have smyten with her are upon the wode. she smote her leg. and
hurted herself to great effusyon and shedynge of blood / The good Eufraxe
seenge the blood rennyng out of the wound by merueylous habundaunce and
plentee / Promptely she knelyd down saying / O my good god I byseche aid
and strength thy poor servant. which suffers somothe harm for to serve
the / And anon after she fell to the earth Her sister Iulyan suddenly
advertised. and having knowledge of this adventure. began to cry so high.
that the abbeise and all her systers came to them and began to weep /

The abbess spoke to her and said. My daughter rejoice the. and speak to thy
systers / Then she took her by the hand and lyfted her up / After that
she bound her leg with a piece of hay^e / Which was of such lynnen clothe
as she was at that time clothed with / She was not done to. as is done to us
when we ben hurt.

For to us ben given oynementes. soft and lynen kyuerchyefs. And yet we ben
not content / The Abbess would have ladde her to the church. but the good
Eufraxe seenge the wood lyenge there said to her systers. that she would not
goo to the church. till she had borne the wood to the kechyn. as she hadd be
acustomyd / Her sister Iulyan an ^ucred to her. My love ye may not so For ye
be ouersore hurt / Nevertheless she would none otherwise do. But laid the
wodd on her neck / The devil seenge her great constaunce hurted her more
thanne he did tofore / For in ly^^ynge up she fell upon the wood.

And in falling entered in to her eye a stycke so deep that the sisters
supposid that she had be lost / Then her good friend Iulyan began to
cry / And said to her / Alas my sister. I said to the well that thou myghtest
not be^e the wood / Eufraxe said to her / My sister draw hardely the stycke
our of mine eye. for it is hoole / Then Julian drew it out. and
Incontynente sprange out great habu^dance of blood / The Abbess came thither.
which putted oil upon the wound. and commanded her that she should goo lie
upon her hedde / And commanded after that the other systers should do yt
that she was wonned to do / But what commandment that the Abbess made.
Eufraxe entremeted always to serve god contynuelly and all her systers /
Notwithstondynge that the blood ran out of her wounds.

A another time she went up in to a Solyer with her sister Iulyan /

And in gooynge up the devil threw her down from the highest greece to the
loweste. Her systers hadd supposyd to have found her deed / but she aroos and
came to them all hoole /

A another time the devil supposed to have slain her. she being in the kechym
/ For in holding the pot full of wortes. made her to fall backewarde / And
after threw boyllynge water upon her visage / Whereof her systers were much
admerueylled / But she began to laughe. Saying that she felt no thing but
cold water

The Abbess seenge these things. assembled and brought togyders all the
auncyente systers for to gloryfye ye name of god / And then they knew anon
right well that she was well bylouyd of her espowse Ihesu Christ.

The custom of the country was that when children were seek of any maladyes
or sykenesses. they brought them to the said monasterye / And anon by the
prayers of the systers they were helyd and guarysshed / Emonge all other there
came a woman that brought her child / which was paralytyke. deyf and dombe /
The Port^er saw it / And forthwyth went and told it to the Abbess / The
which sent it to saint Eufraxe / Whom seenge the child trembling and
quakynge. and so seek. was mo^uyd with pity and compassyon. And made her
prayers for the chiylde saying / My child he that has made the. give the
sanacyon and health at this present time / Then she took the child
being all hoole. and bare it in her arms / And anon the child began to
speak. and to cry after his mother.

When Eufraxe herd it. she was a^erde. by cause it was tofore dombte. and
might not speak. and laid it down on the ground / And In contynent he went
his way to his mother / The which thing was showed to the Abbess by the
Portyere / The which yet not knowing how the child had helyd / Came to the
mother / saying to her angrely. that she did evil so to mock the
Relygyouses / The mode swa^e that her child had never goon. spoken. ne
herd. But sith that the good Eufraxe had borne it in her arms /

In the said monasterye was a woman which had be longetourme^ted with a
devil / And her sykenesse was so terryble and merueyllous that contynuelly
she scumed. or cried so terrybly and so ferfull. that none of the systers
durst goo to her for to give to her mete. But from a far in a vessel bound
to a cord. they delivered to her and admynystred that which she should take
for her refeccyon / On a time among the other / The Abbess commanded to
saint Eufraxe / that she should bear to her mete / And so she did / And in
approchynge to the poor pacyente / The fend of hell which was within her
body tourmented not her / And the poor pacyent did all that she commanded /
And yet more there was / When the other Relygyouses went thither / If they
brought not with them saint Eufraxe. what some ever they did. she would
neither drink ne ete But often she casted the vessel at their heedes /

It happed that Germayne. which always had envy on her / Said that she
would as well bear to her mete. as saint Eufraxe / When the unhappy Germayne
came nyghe to the paciente / She took her and rent all her vestymentes unto
the bare flesh / And began to ete her members. Then^e came some of the good
systers. and showed it to saint Eufraxe / The which anon ran thither. and
took her by ye neck and hondes. And took her away from her / And after
thretened her to beat her / And said to her. If she ever did Insolence to the
systers she should beat her without mercy / And then the poor Demonyake
held her stylle by the word of saint Eufraxe. On the morn after the service
done / came saint Eufraxe for to vysyte the poor pacyent. And found that she
hadd rented her clothes. And ete that which departed from her bynethe out of
her body / Then saint Eufraxe having compassyon and pity of her. made her
prayer to god her maker by the space of an hoole hour. in weeping and
wayllynge for her health / On the morn the abbess sent to seche saint Eufraxe
And said to her / Wherefore haste thou not showed to me that thou made thy
prayer to god Redemer our lord Ihesu Christ for this poor pacyente / Eufraxe
cried her mercy. And said to her / Certainly madame I pray you to pardonne me
/ For I found her in so pyteuous astate and condycyon. that I cowde not longer
tarry without to pray then for her / The Abbess after said to her / My
love I shall say to the one thing in secret / But keep that the fend
dysceyue not you by vaynglorye in any manner / I have had by the reuelacyon of
god. that god our Creatoure has given to the puissaunce to chase a way the
deuyllis out of the body of this pacyent / Eufraxyne herynge thise words
casted asshen upon her heed. and fell down to the ground saying / Alas me
which am a poor synnar. What shall I do for the my god / which haste give
to me puyssaunce and might to hele and guarysshe this poor pacyente / And my
systers have so long time prayed for her. without to obtain and purcha^e her
health / The Abbess ansuered My daughter the time has abyden ye Be thou
suffy^ed. For thy reward is great in the reame of heaven. Then she entered in
to the church. and prayed god. in requirynge his aid / To the end that by
her prayers the seek sister might be guarysshed and helyd /

After the aroos / accompanied with all her systers / and came to the pacyente
/ to whom she said O poor woman. god which has created and fo^urmed the
make the by his mercy now hoole and guarysshe the / And after she made the
sign of the Cross on ye front or forhede of the said pacyente Then the
devil which was wtin her body began horrybly to cry / Ha a must I depart
from this miserable body. wherein I have be so long And after said to saint
Eufraxe / Wherefore thou payllaide and Infamed suffreste thou not me here as I
have be accustomyd. without to persecute me Eufraxe ansuered to him. I
persecute the not. But it is my god and my maker. which co^maundyth the to
void / The devil ansuered / O meschaunte and Infamyd. I shall never depart
hens for the / For thou haste no might to cast me out / Eufraxe said I
know well that I am poor and a miserable synnar / But nevertheless if thou
depart not from her. I shall tormente the with the Pastoralle staff of my lady
the Abbess / Fynably she took the staff. and smote three strokes upon the
pacyent / By the mouth of whom always the devil ansuered that he might not
depart / And said thus. Where woll thou that I goo. Eufraxe said to him. Goo
in to derkenesse and everlasting fire / All the systers were there. which
durst not approach ne come nyghe to her / After that she had long fought
against the devil She made her prayer to god in saying. O my god I pray the
that I be not confounded by the fend / But that it may playse the to preserve
me. in such wise that he overcome me not And in this present hour command
him that he depart and goo his way / Leuynge peasyble this poor pacyente /
And the devil Incontynent^ departed. scumynge and gryntynge the teeth of the
said pacyente / The which at the same hour was guarysshed and helyd /
Then all the systers ladde and brought her humbly and in great reverence to
the church. Loving and magnefyenge the name of our sauyoure Ihesu Christ /

After the said miracle. saint Eufraxe humbled and meked herself more thanne
to fore. And durst not sleep. dredynge the temptacyon of the fend of hell /
And ever she continued to fast all the weke / without etynge any more thanne
ones in the weke.

Certain time after the Abbess saw in her sleep that saint Eufraxe should
depart out of this world. Whereof she was much heavy and sorry / Her sisters
seenge her great heaviness. Prayed her by great humylyte. that it might playse
her to show to to them and tell them the cause of her sorrow / But in no
wise she would tell them. And by cause. that more and more they exhorted her
to tell it to them / She was constrained to say it to them And declared to
them in the manner that folowyth / My denowte daughters tomorne we must leave
the good lady Eufraxe. Whereof I am much Joyous on one side. By cause she shall
be in eternal felycyte / And on that other side I am heavy and sorrowful. For
we shall be pryuated fro her gracyous syghte corporal / But of this reuelacion
say ye no thing to her. leest she should take any fere or dread / Then
all the systers made lamentacions so great. that thayre resouned of their
wepynges / One of them came to Eufraxe where as she made bread with Iulyan. and
said to her. My sister the abbess and all the Covent make for the so great
lamentacyons that it is merueylle / They were much abashed both two / Iulyan
said then. that perauenture the Abbess might have had tidings. of the
Senator / which would come fetch for to rauyssh her by force out of their
monasterye /

Eufraxe ansuered to her. By the living god fro the love of whom. if all the
foundemens of the earth should foundre and faylle / I shall never depart But
my sister Iulyan I pray the goo see if thou may know in any wise the cause
of their wepynges and wayllinges. to the end that my soul be not trowbled /
Iulyan went for to speak to the Abbess / And she being tofore the yates or
doors of the Chapter Herkenyd the Abbess. and herd how she recounted her
vysyon in this manner /

I saw two men coming in hyder which sought Eufraxe. And have said to me /
Abbess enseygne and counseyle Eufraxe. for she has need / After came some
other. which said to me. Take Eufraxe and led her tofore thy lord god /
Then we took her. and went to a gate so noble and so fair that I can not
declare / And after that the said gate was opened to us. We entered in to a
palace wherein were made and solempnysed wedding merueyllously honorable / And
ferther we might not entree / But Eufraxe was taken and presented before the
lord Imperyall of the said palace / And when she was tofore him / She
knelyd down humbly to the ground. and kyssed the fete of the said lord / And
in the same place I saw ten thousand aungellis with Innumerable multitude of
saints. the which there were awaytynge / After came the mother of the said
lord. The which made ready a much fair crown in the chamber of marriage / In
which chamber the said mother so fair / so playsaunt and so amyable made
her to entree. And say to her in delyuerynge to her the said crown / Eufraxe
my love / Hold. Loo here thy reward which thou shalt have. by cause thou
have vaynquysshed all thine enmyes / Now goo thy way. And after ten days
thou shalt come again in to the glory and selycytee of heaven / And yet said
more after the Abbess. Alas this day is the nynthe day / And therefore I
believe that ^omorne Eufraxe shall mou^te in to heaven.

Iulyan which herkenyd all this purpoos. began merueyllously to weep and
waylle. That she bywepte all her body with teeres / And thus weeping she came
again to the oven / where as Eufraxe was knedinge the bread When Eufraxe saw
her. she adui^ed her saying / I commau^de the in the name of god that thou
say me the cause wherefore thou wepest / Then^ Iulyan r^counted the ^aas like
as the hadd vnderstonden / And when ye holy lady had he^de the narracyon /
She fell down to the earth all full of anguysshe and of heaviness / Julian
la^e by her weeping strongely. And Eufraxe said to her / My sister give to me
thine hand and lift me up fro heirs And bring me where the fagottes or
brusshes he^ and leave me there Take also the bread which is in the oven And
he^e it to the systers / Iulyan d^de like as Eufraxe had said to her And
told no thing thereof to the Abbess / Eufraxe being laid on the pament.
And adressynge her words to god said to him My god my maker. Why haste thou
me now in abhomynacyon / Or wherefore dyspyses^e thou me / which am a pore
pilgrim and Orpheline. Alas now is the time in which I ouhte to fight against
the devil mine enmye. I pray the much affectuously. and as much as I may
that thou be to me pyteuouse. And let me live yet by the space of a year / To
the end that I may by waylle. and lamente my sins / For yet never in my
life have I done suffysaunt penance / Alas they that been in hell may not
praise the. But oonly they that been living /

One of the sisters herd Eufraxe weep. And went Incontinent to the Abbess
for to show to her what she hadd herd / The Abbess blamyd the systers. By
cause she had deffended that none should tell her thereof / And commanded
that Eufraxe should be brought to her / The which thing so done / The
Abbess demanded her / My daughter what eylest thou that wepest thus / Madame
I weep by cause that thou know my death. And nevertheless thou haste told
to me no thing thereof / If I had known it / I would have by wept the
great sins of which I am maculate and defoylled.

Alas madame have pity on me. and pray to god with me that he give to me yet a
year of respyte to do penance / Then the Abbess ansueryd to her /
Certainly my daughter god our Redemptour rewards well in heaven / But I pray
the that thou wolt pray for me. To the end that by thy merytes and prays I
may have with the partyeypacyon in the heavenly glory / Anon after the
strong fever took the good lady Eufraxe / And that seenge the systers bare
her in to the Oratorye / And there kept her till even / The even comen / the
Abbess commanded to her Religyouses that they should goo and take their
Refeccyon / all sauf Iulyan / which abode with the Abbess. And they two
shytte the door to them. and abode with Eufraxe.

Think ye that here this hystorye. what lamentaco^ns they made together /
Iulyan said / My lady my sister. my friend. and my dear fellow / I pray the
remember me / And like as I have always holden to the faithful company here in
earth. that I may accompanye the in heaven / And pray to god that I may deye
with the / Alas I have so much louyd the bodyly and spyrytuelly. and now thou
leuest me /

The morn comen / the Abbess sent for all the relygyouse systers^ To the end
that they should come and take leave of saint Eufraxe / Incontinent as they were
comen they said to her / O our good sister. have in heaven mind of thy
systers. And after came the other whom she had guarysshed and helyd by her
prayers and Intercessyons so much desolate and tormented that uneath she
might speak / She kyssyd the hondes of saint Eufraxe. which hadd chaced and
put out the devil of her body / And by cause that Eufraxe ansuered not to the
words that she said to her / The Abbess said to her / My daughter my love.
thou spekest not to thy sister. which is so much sorrowful and desolate /
Then she said / Wherefore sister wepest thou. Let me alone. for I deye.
Pray to god with all thine heart. and he shall save the. Also pray for me /
For at this hour suffryth my soul a great bataylle / Then the Abbess and
all the systers put them in deuowte prayers. During the which. the good
Eufraxe being in the aege of thyrty years rended to god her benygne spyryte /
And after was buried by the deuowte systers in the tomb of her mother / In
loving the name of god of that they had an espowse so holy. and so
agreeable to god /

The good Iulyan which had he mastresse^ and after fellow of saint Eufraxe.
was three days long upon the tomb. weeping there great habundance of teeres.
without thinking to ete or drink / The fourth day she came to the Abbess.
and said to her. Madame pray for me / For our lord Ihesu Christ by the
Intercessyon of his ^izte holy spouse Eufraxe has somoned me to his wedding
/ And the fyfthe day she deyed. And was buried by saint Eufraxe / In like wise
twenty days after the death of saint Eufraxe The Abbess was by the prayers of
the said Eufraxe somoned to her marriage / And did do assemble all the
sisters for to chese an other Abbess / And they chose one named Theogenye /
And after that she was made Abbess / She called her and said / My sister thou
see that the sisters have made good witness of the. And therefore I command
the in the name of the Trynite. that thou think not on temporel gods ne on
vain playsau^ce of this world / Ne suffer thy systers be occupied on erthly
things. But make them to excersyse fastings. prayers. and other virtuous
works / To the end that they may by their merytes get the glory of heaven /

After she said to her systers. Ye my good systers have seen the holy
conuersacyon of the right deuowte Eufraxe / Do ye like as she has done / to
then de that ye may accompanye her in heaven / And have with her the fruycyon
of everlasting blessydnesse / And when she had thus said. she entered in to
her Oratorye / and shytte the door / And after defended. that none should
entere till on the morn. On the morn they came unto the said Oratorye. and
found that she had rendered her spyryte to god. And they buried and said her
solempnely by the said holy saint Eufraxe / And after that time there were non
moo of them buried in the yr sepul^ure /

Ma^ty Demonyakes we^en guarysshed upon the comb. where the deuylles cried O
Eufraxe what shall we do / Thou do us more harm after thy death thanne in
thy lyte By th^se things we ought to enforce us to ensyewe by virtuous works
the right persyghte lyte of saint Eufraxe And in so dooynge fynably we shall
have the glory eternal. The which by her Intercessyons we may get. Amen.

Thus fynysshyth the story of saint Eufraxe /
Of saint Machan^ Romayne which was found night by Paradys terrestre / And
begynnyth in latin Gloriam et magnificentiam. et cetera Caplm.xlviii.


After the report and witness of three devout relygyous men Theophyle.
Serguis. and Thymus. We shall see of the life of saint Machaire / The said three
relygyous men met together by a monasterye in Mesopotamia in the country of
Sy^t between two floodes / Of which that one is named Eufraxes. and that other
Tygris / The Abbot of the said monastery was called Asclypyon. the which
received them benygnely. for to make there their professyon. after the rule of
the said monasterye / Long time after that they had lived comy^ly with the
brethern / On a day about nine of the clock in the morning. they met
together upon the River of Eufrates. in disputynge of the conuersacyon. and of
the great labor of the brethern of the said monastery / And then^e came to
Theophile a thought. Which he said to his two fellows. Sergius. and Th^mus My
brethern I shall say to you / Truly it play sith me / and I have great desire
to walk. and goo so far unto that I may find the heaven and the earth
Join together / The other said / We have hold the always company / And yet we
shall not leave the / For thy manners and thy words playse us. We shall goo with
the. and not forsake the unto the death These words said. they departed from
thens. And after that they had gone by the space of ten days Journey They
arrived and came to the cite of Iherusalem / And worshypped the places where
our lord Ihesus Christ had be. His Cross. his sepulture. and other sayntuaryes

And after came to Bethleem. in which place they also worshipped the cribbe
where in our lord had layen. and were also in the place where the aungelus
speaking to the Shepeherdes songen Gloria in excelsis deo the which place
standyth two mile from Bethleem And after they went up in to the mount of
Olyuete Where as our lord Ihesu Christ ascended in to heaven when he was
received in a cloud ye day of his glorious Ascencyon /

They came again in to Iherusalem. And there adoured and worshyped god. And
after they departed as people gyuynge over and refusing all delyers temporell.
Without to have any regard ne thought to the world /

The fyfthe day they passed the River of Tygris / And entered in to the land
of Perse. They came in to a great field named Assya / In which saint Mercure
martyr slew Iulyan the Apostata / After they reentred in to a cite named
Catyssefodo / In which the bodies of the three children. Anany as. Azaryas. and
Mysaell ben buried / And there they soiourned many days / Four months after
they passed the land of Perse / And entered in to the land of Inde / And
aryued in an how se in which no man dwelled / And there they abode two days
/ And the third day they saw come to them a man and a woman armyd / Of whom
they had great dread / But by cause that the said man and woman had supposyd
that the relygyouse men had been spyrytes or espyes. and returned again / And
assembled almost a three thou sand Ethyopyens / The which arrived there. and
bylette the house al about. where as they weren on their knees prayenge to god
/ And the other set fire at the four corners of the house The which
thing known by the religyous men were much aferde and not without cause /
And sprongen out in to the mids of them. in calling the name of Ihesu
Christ Sauyoure of all the world / The said Ethyopyens after that they had
long parlemented together in their langage which. the said freres understood
no thing / Fynably they lad theym^ and brought them in prison obscure and
derke /

Alas when they weren in prison none gaaf to them another mete ne drink / And
had no comfort of any man living. But began to weep. and required the
mercy of god / When ye cursyd Ethyopyens saw that they were in contynuell
prayer / They let them goo out: In chacynge and betinge them vylandusly and
rygoryously with great staves. till they were out of their prouynce / And they
said that they were four score days without mete. And hereof the Recytour
callyth god to witness / The which for the honor of god we ought pyteuously
to believe Fynably they departed out of their Regyons / And went toward the
cou^treye of the Eest. Where they found a field delycyous all full of trees
berynge sauourous fruit and merueyllouse sweet Whereof they thankyd god / And
ete all their fylle of the fruytes of the said trees / And after passed the
said land of Jude. And entered in to ye land of Chanane When they saw the
vysages of the Inhabytauntes of ye said countreye / They were much
admerueyled In that country ye men dwelled with the wymmen in caves being
under the Ro^hes. They did to them no dysplaysure. For god kept them /
After they went an hundred days toward the Eest. and entered in to the land
of Epythrens. There as ye men have not but a ^ubyte of length / The which
when they saw ye three relygyous men. they fled for fere /

After they came toward the mountains high and merueyllous terryble On
which the son shynyth not. Ne on them grown no trees ne herbs / But
there ben many serpents. Aspy^es. Basylycoks. and dragons on them. And other
Infinyte bestes merueyllous and venymous / The which they had never before
seen / God being their help. they were there by ye space of twenty days
emonge the same beestes without having any harm. sauf oonly that they herd
their ferdefull syflyyges / After they descended in to a place the most
teryble and terdfull ye ever they hadd seen full of roches. some low and the
other high / And Iourneyed by the space of seven days in ye said Regyon / In
the which they rested them by cause they might goo no ferther / And the
seventh day there came an heart. which passed tofore them. Whom they followed
in great traueyll and pain For they found more sharper roches thanne tofore.
And nevertheless they passed that terryble country / And after they found a
scide full of Olyphauntes / the which by goddis grace did to them none
harme^ But they lost their way. And there began to weep in calling to
their aid the name of our lord. And a^ they walked nine days without way
and without to have mete or drink. After by the aid of god they arrived in a
field haboundynge in fruit And after they entered in to a country. where the
son ne the moon did not shine. but there were derke tenchrees and obscu^ous
/ Then they fell prostrate to the earth / In prayenge and requyrynge the
grace of god / And there they were seven days sore troubled with out mete or
drink. and without seenge of any light / They being in contynuell prayer.
came a culuer or a down fleenge abowte them for to moeue them to goo ferther
/ They rend^ynge graces to god aroos up. and followed the said down. till
they came in to a place. where as was thus wreton on a large stone) Who that
woll entree in to this land. he must take the way on ye lift hand / For on
the right side there is no thing but roches and valeyes. And the country is
Inhabytable ^ This scripture hadd made Alexandre the great in fighting against
Da^e the king of Perse / Then they went on the lift side many Journey is /
And forty days after they came in to a place where as was so great a stenche
and fylthe that uneath they might live / But dradde to deye suddenly / They
recomended their souls to god / For they supposed never to have departed from
that stynkynge place. And a little while after they espied a lake full of
serpents casting fire. the which made merueyllous howlings and waylynges
within the said lake. whereof the resownaunce or sown was so porryble that it
semyd it went up to heaven / They herd after a voys fro heaven the which
said. Know ye that this place here that ye see. is the place where they that
renye and forsake god be crucyfyed and tormented / The which voys herd. they
smote on their breasts / And in great dread of god they passed the said lake /
And descended by twene two mountains right high.

In the myddle of whom they saw a man ferdfull of long stature. as of an
hundred cubytes. bound and chayned with great chains of yren / Two chains he
had on one of his sides at^atched to one of the mountains And two other
chains in like wise fyxed to that other mountain / With this he had a great
fire. which enuyronned and was abowte him on all sides And the same monstre
cried so horrybly. that the voys might be herd forty mile ferre^ And when
he saw the said Relygyouses come / He cried more thanne tofore / Wherefore it
was no merueylle though they were aferde And they covered their faces. and
passyd on that other side of the same mountain. After they passed in to a
another place full of roches and caves merueyllously deep / And then they saw
a woman. which had no thing but her here hanging unto the ground / upon
which was a dragon / And when the said woman would speak the same dragon
bote her tongue. And putt his heed within her mouth / And if they were
abashed before. yet weren they more after With this herd they voices in the
said Cauernes. which cried and said / O Ihesu Christ ye sone of god
omnipotent. Have pity. Have pity on us / Then the said Relygyous putt them
to prayer. and prayed god that he would take their souls / For they had seen
his Iugemens. which ben much to be fered and redoubted / From that place they
departed. and anon after they founden a another place full of trees. like to
fygge trees. Upon which trees they saw in four me of birds many beestes.
Which cried in saying with an high voys / O our Sauyoure and Redemer. which
haste fourmed and created. forgive to us our sins. Give to us mercy as you
art merciful. For we have sinned upon all the face of the earth / Then^e
the said Relygyouses began to make their prayer to god that they might have
reuelacyon of that. which they had seen. By cause that they might not know
it / They herd then a voice which said to them / Goo on your way / For
it apperteyneth not to you to know the dyuyne secrets /

And soo^ they went forthon. and found a place much playsaunte and
delectable / In which were four men having faces fair and merueyllously
playsaunte / Also upon their hedes each a crown aourned and set with
precious stones And in their hondes they helden great palms all of gold. and
also swerdes all nakyd / But with this they had before them a great fire
much great and enflammed:

The said Relygyouses seenge these began to cry in saying / O lords and
servants of god. have pity on us / To the end that these swerdes and this
fire do us none harm /

Then they ansuered to them. friends dread ye no thing / But goo ye the way
which has be showed to you by god / The which has set us in this place
for to keep the passage unto the day that he shall come to Judge the universal
world /

After they passed and went forty days without any mete. but they drank
oonly water. And as they went they herd melodyouse songs and armonyous as of
Infenyte nombre of people / Symphonysynge more swetter thanne any other
Instruments /

After they felt an odoure more sweet thanne bame. and also thanne any other
spyces aromatyke in all the world / And by the virtue of those armonyes and
sweet savors they slepte / Anon after they awoke. And in beholdynge before
them / They saw a church decorate and ornate above all puyssaunce humayne /
For it semyd all to be made of crystal / In that church was an awter much
well arrayed / By which and by a fountain there being. sourded and sprange a
water white as milk / Abowte which fountain weren people which songen
songs of Cherubyn /

Now for to dyscryue the form of ye said church / The party without for
the on the side of the South was of ye color semblable or like to a precious
stone named Prasym. The party toward the North was red as blodde / And
toward the Eest white as milk There was also upon the same church many
sterres. more shynynge than^e they that shine in this world / The son shone
and was more hoter seven times thanne in our land / The mountains and the
trees were without comparyson more higher thanne they of this Regyon / And the
fruytes of the said trees were much fayrer. and also much swetter / The
song of the birds that flewe there resowned up to heaven The earth of that
place had two colource / Of whom that one was white and that other reed / These
relygyouses then all abashed. salewed the enhabitauntes of that place. and
went forth their way / And they went an hundred days without mete. But of
water they drank enough / And suddenly they saw com^ toward them a
multitude of men and wy^^men. which were but a cubite bye. which made them
sore aferde / But they set their lives in the hand of god. and went
against them / And Incontinent by the virtue of god they fled Then the
said Relygyouses took their refecco^n of herbs which they found in that
place. And rendered than kings to god. which had delyuerde them from so
many perils /

And after by the will of god they found a fair way to walk in / by which
they went many Iourneyes / And in walking they found a cave playsaunte
enough / and clenly within /

In to which they entered / After that they were within. they marked them with
the sign of the Cross. But they found there no person And by cause they
found the place so clean. they ymagyned that some man dwelled there / And so
abode there till even. for to know if he that dwelled there would come / They
being there within slepten / And after that they were a waked. they went out
of the cave. And Incontinent they saw a man having his heeres as white as snow
/ The which covered all his body / When the said man saw them. he fell
down to the ground / And after he aroos and said to them. If ye ben on
goddis half / Mark ye with the sign of the Cross. Or ellis goo ye your
way out from me in the name of god / which sayden to him. that he should no
thing be aferde / And that they were ye servants of god as he was / This
seenge that good man. was long in his prayers And notwythstondyng that he had
be long in that place. Yet was his face as shynynge as the vysage of an
angel / His brows covered his eyes by force of old aege. The vngles or
nails of his fete and hondes weren merueyllously long. His berde and his
heeres covered also all his body / And his skin was as hard as the shelle
of a lymace / The said holy man also weeping demanded of the three Relygyouses
pylgryms of whens they were / And wherefore they weren thither come / and of the
estate of mankind.

And if the Sarrazyns and Ethnycyens persecuted more the faith / The said
pilgrims recounted to him all their aduersytees / And how they sought to
find the place. where as heaven and earth Joined together / The holy man said
then to them that fro the place where as they were. it was no far way to
paradyce terrestre / But no man might goo thither. But if the aungellis bare
him. like as a voice had said to him when he him self would have goon
thither /

He told to them also as the angel had told to him. that it was but twenty
miles to the place where as Adam was created and fourmed. and to the said
paradise terrestre. Where as the earth Ioynyth to heaven /

The said pilgrims herynge these words. were much enjoyed / And entered in
to the cave with the said holy man / When the even was comen he prayed them
and said: That they should not hold them within the said cave / By cause
that there were with in a little space thereby two lions. which camen every
night to lie with hy^ And he fered them sore. leest they should do to them
any harm or dysplaysure / Anon after they saw the said two lions come. But
the good holy man went and met with them / And deffended and forbadde ye
said lions to do them any greyf / The which deffence made. they soiourned
there surely /

On the morn they asked of the holy man. of his estate and conuersacyon / and
also of his name / And of what place he was / To whom he ansuered / First that
he was named Machaire / And was borne at Rome. sone of a noble Romayne
flourysshynge in good renomme and fame thorugh out all the empire / After he
recounted to them of his life and conuersacyon. and ye cause wherefore he was
departed from Rome. And began to recyte and show to them / That he being
young / his fader would have married him. and in deed was fyaunced and troth
plyghted. and a day accepted to be wedded At which day after that al
things necessary for the weddy^ge were made ready / And the lords Romans
boden for to goo to the celebraco^n and so lempnytee of the said wedding /

The holy man seenge the same preparacyons and ordynaunces / And that the hour
approchyd and drew nyghe Secretly he departed from the house / of his fader.
And hid him in the ^ous of a woman a widow with whom he was famylyer /

In her house he was seven days hid without to be seen of any person of
the cite of Rome / That same wydowe went every day in to the house of his
fader. And knew all ye was said of him sith he came to her house And showed
all to the said holy man His fader seenge that he might not find him was
much angry and also his mother with all their friends /

The eyghte day after which was Sunday. he took leave of the said wydowe.
and went openly thorugh ye street / And in gooynge he found in his way. a
man much old / whom he salewed demanding whether he went and if he would
hold him company To whom the old man ansuered yt he would do as it should
playse him / And so they went together out of Rome in sechynge their mete fro
door to door / And long time they went together by the ways. the which ye
threpilgryms tofore named had holden / And after the good Machaire recyted yt
when he came a.xxx. mile nyghe to the place where as he was / and recyted these
things. that same old man which had acompanyed him sith he departed from
Rome vanisshed a way and wyste not where he became /

Then was saint Machaire sore trowbled. In so much he wyste not what to do
/ But laid him down on the earth / and there wayled and went habundauntly /

And he being in this point wayllynge and weeping. The same man that was in
his company / apperyd to him again. and said / Right dear brother anger the
no thing / For I am the Angel Raphaell sent from god. for. and to help
the in thy necessytees /

And know ye that by ye commandment of god I have brought the hither Our
lord has always helped the In gyuynge way prosperouse / By the which thou
haste passed all the der^e places / And them where as ben the tourmentes of
souls / Now thou art in light / And therefore thou ought now to dread no
thing. But goo forth in the way that thou haste begone /

These things thus said. the angel departed from him / Then reprysed and
took again saint Machaite his strength. and went forthon / And right soon
after he found a wild ass / The which he adjured in the name of god that he
should adresse and govern him the way. by which he might surely goo / After
the said coniuracyon. the ass went forth by a little path / And so
following him saint Machaire went with him two days / And the third day he
found an heart without comparyson more greter thanne any of the country / The
said ass seenge the said heart / had great dread. and left the holy man.
which was then sore trowblyd. By cause he might not know ne see any wayne
pathe.

He then so abashed that he wist not what to do / He adjured the heart
that had be cause to make him to lose his guide / That he himself should
guide him. and led him surely And Incontynente the said heart came to him.
like as a good came be / And in a strayte way he began to goo to fore the
good holy man / In lokynge be hynde him if he folowyd him always And so they
went togider three days /

The fourth day they found a dragon merueyllous: which lay alonge in the
way / And when the heart saw the dragon. he fled a way. and the good man
abode alone / And wyste not what to do. but to call on the name of god / And
fell down prostrate to the earth for to make his prayer /

After he blessed him with the sign of the Cross / And commanded in the name
of god the said dragon that he should do to him none harm. ne lettinge / And
then it haped by miracle. and against the common usage of nature. that the
dragon spoke. and said to him / Come on hardly. come on well happy and
servant of god Machaire. The angel Raphaell showing me thy face. has
commanded me that I should come to the / for to lead the to the place which
is arrayed for the by the commandment of god /

It is four days sithe I have abyden for the without mete or drink / In
this night I have seen the in a cloud right shynynge / And have herd a voice
which said to me that I should haste me for to lead the and conduyte. By
cause thou were not far from / Wherefore come on promptely and follow me. And
dread the no thing / For by the aid and help of god I shall led the to the
place. Which by him is made ready to the / In which thou ought to love and
praise god /

These words said by him that semyd to be a dragon / Suddenly he transfygured
and changed himself in to likeness of a young man / As the same holy fader
said / and brought him unto ye holy place. where he recited al thise things /
And where as the said pylgryms had founden him / And he said yet ferthermore.
that he being arrived in the said cave / The said young man vanysshed away
/ And then he humbly thanked god. in gloryfyenge him of the graces that he
had done to him / In preserving him fro the great dangers. wherein he had been. er he was comen unto the said place / Nevertheless he said that he
had be often tempted of the devil / Which often came to vysyte him. for to
give to him empesshement and lettynge in his contemplacyons. And emonge his
other temptacyons. he had presented him a little bend. to swadle a little
child bring in his cradle / The wyche bend the holy man had taken. and
putt it in his cave forgetynge to bless him. ne to make prayer in taking it /

A another time he had laid tofore his cave a payr of shoes of a woman /
which semblably and in like wise he had taken and laid by the laid bend /
And the third time the devil apperyd to him in lyckenesse of a woman. cladde
with rich habyllements. And was aourned and arrayed with precious stones /
When the said holy man saw that / Not imagining that it was the devil.
spoke to her famylyerly. and demanded what she was / And how she was comen in
to his ^aue / Then she as heavy and sorrowful began to weep and cast out
gre^e syghynges / The holy man seeng that she wept. mouyd of pity and
compassyon began to weep with her /

And then the devil began to speak to him saying. O holy man servant of
god. I am the daughter of a noble Romayne / which some time was fyaunced and
trouthplyght in marriage to a noble man of Rome But when the day was comen. in
which we should have made the marriage. He to whom I should have be spowsed and
married went his way secretly. that never sith was seen / And when I saw
that he was departed from Rome And that his parents and kynnesmen and friends
sought him in great heuinesse / I was not Joyous. But the same night departed
also pryuely. with out taking leave of any person. And have passyd as well by
mountains and valeyes. as by many other dangerouse places without guydynge of
any living person / And thus all allone am I comen hither /

Saint Machaire wenynge that she was his wife / Took her swetely by the hand
and ladde her in to his cave /

But the devil contynuelly wept / Wherefore the holy man was the more ready to
believe that it had been his wife / And wept semblably and in likewise with
her / After their lamentacyons and wepynges the holy man took akehornes and
herbs. and would have made her to ete. wenynge that she shel^e cesse her
sorrow / Now the holy man Machaire understood not the cautelles and dysceytes
of the devil / The which at beginning were over subtle and strange for
to be understand And so they deuyseden long with in the said cave. that one
sitting by that other / And in speaking together the forsayde woman towchyd his
hondes. by manner of flaterye. As now many done for to moeue the men to us
^^^ouse and foul sin of lecherye / And in thus dooynge the poor man without
to bless him ne comau^dynge him to god. fell a sleep / As if he had be
traueylled of many labors /

Now it happed in slepynge. by thart or subtyltee and shrewdenesse of the
devil / That he dremyd to be with his wife and to have her company. in such
wise. that when he awoke. he found himself all dyscoueryd and ponished o^
defoylled / as he had flesshly done with his wife / Then knew he that it
was the devil. By cause that after he had slepte. he saw ne apperceyued her
no more / Then he began to lamente and make sorrow. and make many
exclamacyons and cries to god. In requyrynge him humbly of pardonne and mercy /

Now it is to be noted that the two lions which he had found in his cave
when he there first arrived. After he had done this sin. forsoken him
and departed fro him. The which thing by him known. And for ye great
dysplaysaunce that he had for his sins. He put him again to prayer
Prayenge god that he would enseygne and show him / what suffysaunt penance he
ought to do / And that it would playse him to send again to him his two
lions / And Incontynente after by the will of god which herd his request and
petycyon. would reduce and bring him to the way of he^the. The said lions
returned / and began promptely to make a fosse. or a pytte of the largeness
and depnesse suffysaunt to the common stature of a man The holy man that seenge
/ thought that god would: that he should do his penance in the said pytte /
And commanded the lions that they should couere him in the same / And so they
did /

He being in the said pytte by ye space of three year / Happed that by the
great Inundaco^n and flowynge of waters the which descended there. the said
cave was broken. And a part fell upon his heed. in such wise that by the
moyen of the said rumpure and brekynge where as he had not seen no light
in three year. He saw the son clearly shine and gyuynge light / Then he
took the herbs. which he found beside him. and ete of them / The lions
after came again. And they seenge the cave broken and dysconuerte. They
dyffeated the pytte / and brought him out all hoole without any gryef or
brusure / Then he came out of the fosse or pytte / And rendered than kings
of that he had lived so long without seenge of son ne moan And also
without to have any harm of his body he was delivered from the same cave /
And knelyd down to the ground. and was forty days and forty nyghtes
without moeuynge himself. Like as he had he Inmobyle in gloryfyenge the
name of god /

The said forty days passyd. He came again in to his cave. And there he
saw four aungellis which shone so merueyllously that all the cave was
enlumyned And in the myddle of them was our lord and Redemer Ihesus Christ in
form of a man. Holding in his hand a rod of gold / and made a sown so
strongly resownyng like the voys of ten men / The same noble company songen
long / And when their song was accomplysshed and fulfyllyd / Three voices
together ansuered (Amen) And Incontinent our Savior Ihesu Christ with his
aungellis which acompanied him vanysshed away. and went in to heaven / And
after in a voys descended a douue within the said cave / And Incontynente was
herd a noyce romblynge as thundre / and also lyghtnynges Innumerable / He
herd also many voices from heaven. which songen^ Sanctus. Sanctus. Sanctus.
Dominus deus / etc Then^e the holy man herynge and seenge the said woundres.
was all taken in a trance. and rauysshed in spyryte. And fell down to the
earth. On which he was right days without moeuynge hand ne foot / The
which passyd he awoke / And then he knew that god had sanctefyed and
hallowed that place / And given there his benedyccyon and blessing / And then
he recu^ned in to the said cave and praised the name of god / in gyuyng to him
thankynges and louynges of his vysytacyon. And that his grace had made him
worthy to have his company /

At the time of the same vysyon: He was in the aege of forty year. And had
dwelled but seven years in the said cave When he hadd recounted and told
all these things to the three Relygyous pilgrims / That is to wit Theophyle.
Sergius and Thimus / He Instruct and showed to them the manner. how they
might void the cursyd temptaco^n and decepcyon of the devil of hell / In
saying to them. that they sholden remember and have in mind always how the
devil hadd dysceyued him subtylly / And after he admonested and desired them
to abide with him. Or if it playsed to them not to abide there. that they
should return in to their monasterye / All these considered by the three
Relygyouses / they were much abashed and fell down to the earth in
gloryfyenge the name of god / Which oonly does so many merueyllous things /
And also they rendered to him thankynges of that he had brought them to ye
knowledge of the holy man /

Their oryson fynysshed they prayed to the glorious saint Machaire that he
would pray for them to the Sau^our of the world / That he would save and
keep them in retournynge in their abbaye / To the end that by all the
monasteryes where as they should goo They might also well recite and tell that
which they had seen / For to ercyte and moeue all Relygyous men to live
virtuously / For they byleuyd f^^mely that god hadd brought them to the said
place / for and to the end to know the holy man / And also for to show and
manyfeste his holy life and conuersacyon /

The holyman Machaire made humbly then his prayer to god for them And after
gaaf to them his blessing And after kyssed them in recom^undynge them to
god / To the end that they might make their voyage in peace after his good
playsure and will

Fynably he commanded his two lions that they should conduyte them till they
were passed the derke places: where as they were seven days and seven nyghtes.
without departinge from the place. like as it is tofore written / The which
lions after that by sign they had taken leave of the holy man brought them
unto the place. where as Alysaundre hadd made the writing making mencyon of
the ways. like as it is declared tofore And when they came to the said place.
the lions little humbled them / and took leave of them / And returned to the
holy man / And after they went with the grace of god so long. that they
entered in to the land of Perse. without to have any lettynge / And camen to
the cite of Catessodo. In which ben the three children that were put in the
furnays of fyte nyghe by Babylone / And after they passed the River of Tygre.
And the fyftenth day after they reentred in to Iherusalem. And there vysyted
the holy places. as they had done before / And fynably they came again in to
their monasterye / In which when they were arrived / recounted all that
which they hadd seen / And pryncypally of saint Machaire / And then all the
Relygyouses glorifyeden the name of god / To whom be given laud and glory
eternal. Amen /

IHesu Christ our Savior. like as has written saint Iherom has not
manyfested nor showed his Reame ne his glory oonly to great and excellent
clerks of this world. But to simple and ygnoraunt of all science and
cunning / As now now ye shall see in the life of saint Pastumien / The which
was of the lygnage and kynred of Mempheus. that was a paynem / And was in his
yongthe much simple. and vncunnynge of lettres. Not defoyllyd with vices of
Paynems But lived by enbraydynge and weuynge of cords of Ionkes /

He never pronounced foul word out of his mowthe. And yet when he was in
the world. He fled besyly and often the conuersaco^n of wymmen / Ever more he
lived in charitee. and had peace with every person. without to moeue with
his neighbor any discord ne dyscencyon. Applyenge himself to all virtuous
werkts. Notwythstondynge that he was not yet Christian He being in the aege of
thyrty year God would take from him the corrupcyon of synne^ for to make him to
have the life eternal /

On a time the aungel came and said to him / Pastumyen haste thou not known
god of heaven / And he ansuerde. Nay / And that oonly he did his ^^at^. But if
god were in heaven or not he had not herd say. For he was not a clerk for
to know the things dyuyne and celestyall / The angel then said to him /
Now pray god / and he shall give to the sapyence / To whom ansuered the holy
man / that he cowde not pray / For he knew not what prayer was / Then the
angel took a leyf of the Laurel tree. and set a prayer thereon. saying to
him / That he should ete it / And how well that it semyd him bitter Yet
nevertheless it gaaf him the form and manner to pray god / The said holy
man Incontinent ete it / And it was bitter to him in his mowthe. But all his
heart was replenysshyd with swetnesse. Thus then he began to praise and
magnefye the name of god. The angel after towchyd his lyppes / And took from
him the bytternesse of his mouth. And anon after saint Pastumyen knew high
things of holy scripture. like as he had estudyed therein all his life /

After the angel said to him that he should set his knees to the ground
and his face in to the Eest. And that Incontinent he should have without
defawte all that he would demand of god / So he did. And that done he
began to say I shall love and praise all my life the name of god. which is
so benygne to teache them to know that been ygnoraunce. And byscyence Infusyd
makyth suddenly by them his name. his law and his glory to be manyfested / O
my god my maker thou haste sent to us fro heaven thy propre sone for to redeem
us from the pains and trybulacions of hell by his sorrowful passion / In the
name of ye same thy sone which is god and man I require the and pray as
humbly as I can or may that to me which am here in darkness woll give
light and clerenesse. My god my redemer / thou wotest and know. that I
cowde not say one word that was to thy praysynge. if thou had not taught
me /

Now I believe steadfastly that ye blind by yllumynacyon and lightnyd seen
clearly / The deyf have herynge. the dombe have speaking / The crokyd go on
right / Poor and simple of understanding have knowledge of great scyences and
enseignementes. And also the poor and miserable synnars ben of the called Alas
my god my maker what was I What might ne what ^^^gthe have I had by which I
yt was so simple. was worthy to be called of the. for to praise the. magnyfye.
and serve. By which I dare require and demand for to be puryfyed and clensy^
of my spots and fylthes of sin I have lived always like unto the Paynyms.
which ben as brute beestes And now I know that the synnars shall never have
Joy after their death if they convert them not to the faith And for so
much as thou which act my Redemer will not that I be lost by my poor
freyltee / I supply the that it may playse the to enseygne and teache me
better and better / To the end that I may know the as my only Savior and
protector / And as right puyssaunt king soueraynly regnynge in heaven and in
earth / Which better thanne any other may enfourme me in thine holy law.
And fynably will give to me the glory eternal /

And from thens forth on Pastumyen besyed him in deuowte comtemplacyons /
Always awaytinge that the angel of god should come again to him But that
notwithstondynge he went again to his craft / which was as tofore is said
to make cords of Ion^es /

And fynably the angel apperyd to him and said / Pastumyen wolt thou that I
led the to a priest / Which shall baptyse the in the name of the fader and of
the sone and of the holy ghost / To whom he ansuered that it was the grettest
Joy that might come to him / And that he desired none other thing Anon the
angel took him by the heeres / and bare him unto a place where as was an an
holy man named Prisce / To whom the Angel commanded that he should enseygne:
and teache him the faith and law / And to live as a good Christian / The holy
fader seenge the great bryghtnesse of the angel. Suddenly he was abashed in
such wise that he fell down for fere / But the angel releuyd him and
comforted him saying. Be not aferde / for I am the servant of god as thou
art / And in saying thise words ye angel changed his form unto the
semblaunce or lickenesse of a man clad with white. and of a playsaunt face /
After again he said to him / Doubt the no thing / I come to the for to
show to the fro god / That it is his playsure that thou take to the this good
man Pastumyen / And that thou enfourme him in the faith of holy church. To
the end that he may deserve the glory eternal / And Incontinente the
angel departed /

Saint Prysce then took Pastumien. And enfourmyd him in the faith / And to
fast and to do other virtuous works / After he baptized him. and this done
he made a prayer unto our lord saying thus. O sone of god I yield to the
humbly tha^kynges of this that it has playsed the. by thine holy ghost to
reconcyle me to god thy fader And thou haste redemyd me from eternal death /
The which death suffren perpetuelly all they that believe not in thy name /
Alas I knowledge now that (...) all things. the less ought to obey the
gretter. And the simple to them that been wise /

The second commandment that ye ought / for to keep is subieccyon

To the end that in reverent dread ye may serve god with a chaste heart pure
and clean /

The third is that ye ought to live sobrely and Justly. in having compassyon
on your souls and of others /

The fourth that ye ought to chastyse your bodies by fastings and abstynence
after your possybylyte / For to the spyryte desiring to get virtue. it is a
synguler delectaco^n and playsaunce. to be and enhabyte in a body lene by
penance /

The fyfthe is for to be often in oryryson and prayer in ens^ewyng the doctrine
of the appostle. which commaundyth us to pray god without ceassynge / For
after his doctrine all they that contynuelly fast and pray to god Lightly
they putt under by the virtue of the faith all the cautels and subteltees of
the devil of hell / And causyth also to resyste and wythstonde all vices and
sins /

First and pryncypally to pride / For of that sin proceden all euylles.

And every day as one sees by experyence / Pride is the orygynall root of al
sins / By pride ben the aungellys cast down in to hell / By cause that
Adam desiring to know the good and evil. ete of the fruit forboden in
transgressynge and brekynge the commandment of god / By this concupiscence he
deseruyd and bound him and all his posterytee and ofsprynge unto the death
eternal / Whereof we had never be quyte. if the blessed sone of god. by his
great mercy. and by his worthy death and passion had not quyted and redeemed
us /

The virtue opposyte and contrary to pride is Humylytee root of all good /
And the beginning and get^nge of al virtues. without the which was never none
ne never shall person be perfyghte / And the cause that most moeuyd our
blessed Sauyoure to take our humanyte in the womb of the vyrgyne of the
Intemerate and most clean and right blessed vyrgyne Marye. that was her
humylytee. For in so doing is written in the Cantycle / God has beholden the
humylytee and mekenes of his hondmayde (Qu^a respexte humilitatem ancille sue
etc)

After the holy man Pastumien commanded them that they should have charytee
fraternall together in having perfyghte faith / Saying that ye princypall Rule
and most grettest charge that Religyouses ought to have. is for to have one
with a another perfyghte love and charytee / Without the which none
Relygyouses in the cloystre may not well govern theymselfe / When many
brethern ben together without love. each entendyth to his synguler prouffyte /
And so their comynte is divided / So every reame and other government of
multitude and of subgettes. if it be divided. without doubt it is desolacyon
/ Alas now the most part of Relygyouses in this present time ente^de to be
Abbottes. Pryours and to offices. Desiring to be out from their brethern /
Like as the bird sechyth. but to escape out of the cage /

And who should demand or wit the reason wherefore. I trow that there should
be defaulte to have love with their brethern / For by cause that they ben
ouermoche replenysshyd and fulfyllyd with the dampened vice of Pride. they can
not be compatyble and felyshypped with the other / But woll be alone A lord
god well is changed ye time that the holy faders fledd in to deserte sedynge
there a solytary life. for to renounce and leave the world / and to lead a life
contemplatyf / And as it is said the Relygyouses when they be closyd in an
abbay. where as they have been put for to be out of the world / They think on
none other sin but to opteyne and get pryeryes and other benefyces / Whether
it be by sin or no sin. to the end to return again to the world / For
the which things all devotion is lost / Perauenture if the Pryours were
united and onyd with ye abbayes / And that such Relygyouses had none occasyon
for to depart with out license / It should be better. and lightlyer for their
health / thanne for to seek their lodges from vyllage to vyllage /

It has be seen in time passed that the children of kings for to serve god
have renou^ced and utterly forsaken all their rychesses / But now when there
ben many in a noble house / they ben made Abbottes. tofore that they ben
relygyouses. No thing for devotion But to the end for to enryche them with
goods and rychesses of the church for to live at their playsure

God knowyth what shall be the end

ANd following then the doctrine and tethynge that Pastumyen gaaf to his
Religyouses He commanded them ferthermore to love not oonly the one that
other. But to love god pryncypally with all their heart / That was the first
commandment. that god gaaf to Moses in the moutayne of Synay / But with the
same commandment must be Joined the lone. that we ought to have that one
with a another /

When all Relygyouses louen each other / and god pryncypally and first /
Yet must they have the virtue of obedyence / Love without obedyence is no
thing. For like as the grass lettyth the corn to fructefye and encreace / In
like wise who that is in obedient and fastyth and prays / bryngyth fourth no
fruit for fawte of obedyence /

After he commanded them to excercyse the nyghtes in prayers / For by night
the devil makyth moo lettynges to deuowte persons. thanne he does in the
day. Like as the Gospel says / Who woll do evil. Hatyth light / And to
this purpoos says ye Gospel. Awake. awake. For ye know not the hour when
the theyf of the souls woll come /

He commanded them also that they should write in a Table of their
conscyences all the commandments of god / And that often they should lay the
clothe for to take refeccyon spyrytuell. in sauourynge and etynge the ten loves
composyd of the ten commandments of the faith The twelve artycles of the
law / And the works of mercy /

More over he said / O ye my brethern / which desire to be very obedyent and
charytable to love each other / believe ye after the sentence of Baruth the
prophet which says / that ye ben now the fellows of god / And in a another
place the holy scripture says well happy ^en the peasyble. For they ben ye
sons of god / Now they that been peasyble ben obedyent and charytable /

They thene that shall desire in this corruptyble world to enjoy the fruytes
of heaven / He must renounce and forsake his propre will. in having perfygh^e
charity /

After he commanded them. if they had among them any dyscencyon. or
debate / that Incontynente it should be appeasyd / For god our lord dwellyth
ne abides but in one place of peace / And the contrary where as is dyssencyon.
the devil regnyth.

And ferthermore he deffended them that they never should be angry ne wroth ne
to their brethern. ne to straungeres / And that for any gain of the world
that they might get. They should not o^cupye them with temporell things.
But oonly in works spyrytuell. By the which they might lyghtely get the
heritage of the Reame of heaven /

And when any temptacyons should come to them. the which with great pain the
ymyghte eschew / He admonested them to torn to god / In life tynge their
hondes to heaven. And saying O my god I pray ye that it playse the to help me
/ And to enforce my poor freyltee. to the end that I may vaynquysshe and
surmounte my mortal enemy /

And he said that anon after our prayer made to god. Comen his aungellis to
our aid for to comfort us / And for to prove this thing to be true. He
told then^e to them. that on a time. he being on a mountain came tofore him
a great company of deuyllis in lyckenesse of men humayne. And by cause that by
the will of god he knew well that they were deuylles / He all resoluyd / And
without having any dread. kneled down on the earth. in prayenge god. that it
would playse him to make the same deuylles to depart /

And Incontinent they vanysshed away as a fume or a smoke tofore the wind /

Many other temptacions the deuylles made to him. But god delivered him always
by the deuowte prayers yt he made /

Therefore in concludynge he said to his Relygyouses / My children be ye ferme
and stable in the faith. in resystynge the deuylles temptacyons / And that ye
ben clymynge by feruente charity to the love of god / The which in so
dooenge. he shall to you be always a protector / And by his help ye may get
the reame of heaven /

Thus endyth the storye of the right holy man Pastumyen.
Here folowyth of saint Onuffryen Heremyte / And begynnyth in latin Beat
memory paphoncius. et cetera / Caplm.l.


Saint Phaphunce having desire for to vysyte all the Relygyouses that weren
in the hermytages. for to accomplysshe the health of his body more lightly his
way. bare with him a lityll water and bread / And when he had walked by ye
space of four days. his vytaylle faylled him / And became all confused and
half deed. By cause he was so feeble yt he had neytheyr foot ne leg that
might sustain him / by cause he had neither to ete ne to drink / But
nevertheless he was by the help of god made all hoole and guarysshed / And
had as much strength. as though he had well eten and dronken / And then
began to walk again. And continued so four days without mete and drink
The said four days passed / by cause he felt himself feeble / He was
constrained to lie down on ye earth. as he had be deed / And he lyenge on
the earth. Suddenly saw by him a man in merueyllous glory. ferdfull and
terryble in shynynge / Worthy of prasynge in beawte / Long of corpulence. and
right clear of regard / Whom Paphunce seenge had great fere. but anon after
he comforted him / For in approchyng towched his lyppes and his houdes / And
restored and gauf to him strength / And Incontinent aroos up and walked
seuentene days. after. till he came to a place where as god would bring him.
To which place he came and saw a man as he rested. having his face terryble
all coueryd with here like as a brute be /

And fro the raynes down allow he had a vestement of leaves and of herbs /
When Paphunce saw this man so deformyd / He was sore abashed / And not
without cause / For he had never seen such lyckenesse of man ne of woman.
and wist not what to do. But fled in to a mountain. which was nyghe to
that place. And there hid him under the branches of the trees / He was so
sore aferde /

And there he began to syghe merueyllously. Knowing that by cause of his
aege and abstynence. he might goo no ferther /

This man seenge that Paphunce was fled tofore him / and that he was aferde
came nyghe to him. And calling and cryenge with an high voys said to him. O
man of god come down from the moyntayne / And be not aferde / For I am a man
mortal as thou art / When Paphunce herd these words he was glad and
comforted / And took again his mind and courage. and anon came down from
the place where he had been / And after that he hadd salewed the holy man He
fell down on his knees tofore him The holy man anon defended him that he
should not knele to him saying so him / A^yse thou my friend thou art the
servant of god named Paphunce. loved of all the saints of heaven /

Then Paphunce aroos up. Notwythstondyng that he was weary as well for his
long fastings. as for his old aege After he made him to sytte by him.
Desuynge to know his name^ his conuersacyon and manner of living. He said to
him / Know thou servant of god that by long Iourneyes I have walked in
thise deserts and have endured great hungre and thirste / But now my vyage is
accomplysshyd and fulfilled. And I feel a solace in my members / Like as they
were all fyllyd and quyte of all pain / And therefore I pray the my lord and
my friend for the hononore and love of him. For the name of whom thou have
dwelled in thise deserts thou tell me whens thou art. and thy name / And also
when thou camyst in to this place to enhabyte here / The holy man seenge the
great affeccion of his desire. and also the traueylle that he had taken. to
find. Ansuered to him of that he had asked. And demanded him in saying to
him. First that his name was Onuff^en. Secondly that it was three score and ten
years that he had dwelled in that deserte / Living with brute beestes.
etynge grapes and herbs in the mountains and valeyes And sith that he came
thither he had never seen man ne woman sauf him only / Nevertheless he
said that in his yongthe he had be nourysshed in a monasterye named
Her^mopolyn in ye prouynce of They / In which monasterye were an hundred
Relygyouses /

After he declared to him how the relygyouses of the said monasterye lyueden
in e^ynge and drinking all togider. And did then penaunces that one like to
that other / And that which was playsaunt to that one. was to that other
agreeable And yet that was more They had all one will. One heart. And one
thought /

In the said monastery was so great ta^ytu^ytee and scylence among ye
Relygyouses. that none durst ones speak without a Just cause / He being in
this said monasterye. herd recounte the life of an holy fader named Helye /
And how he had lived in great abstynence in deserte. in great straytnesse of
life / And how he had many preuyleges above the power of man kind / In like
wise of saint John^ Baptyst which ladde so holy and merueylouse life in
deserte. till that he had baptized our lord Ihesu Christ in ye flo^ Jordan /
Then herynge. told of the Relygyouses the gloryouse lives of theym^ and many
other /

The said Onuffryen required of the said brethern. that they would say to
him. If the ancient holy faders of the deserte had been more strong than^e
they or more feeble / They ansuered that they had been more strong. For
without mannis comfort and with out mete and drink they lived in deserte
But they said. that in speaking as they had been the holy faders of the said
deserts. We have consolacion the one of an other / For when we have hungre.
we find the mete ready / When we ben seek / We think Incontinent and done
penance to get us health We have fair houses and great edyfyces / And they
that been in deserte have no consolacyon / They have hungre. cold. and hete.
And in all tribulacyons have no socours but of god And therefore whom some ever
woll dwell there^ Him behouyth to be constaunt and steadfast for to endure al
such penaunces / Yet more the devil gyuyth to them without comparison more
settynges and temptacions for to dyuerte them from their good will / yt to
them comynyke by the world /

But when they have very faith Always they overcome the fend by arms
spyrytuell / The aungellis comfort them often / And deliver to them that is
necessary for them / For it is written / that they that shall putt their hope
in good. Shall have the virtue of strength for to endure all thing / with
feathers as an Egle for to flee to heaven / And yet more. they that shall have
thirst. shall drink in the fountain eternell / And the herbs that they
shall ete. shall give to them also great swetnesse as honey /

When the Relygyouses ben tempted of any temptacyons / They ought to putt
them to pray god. lyftyng their hondes to heaven And Incontynente the angellis
descend and come down for to help them to fight against the devil /

Thus also says the prophet Dauyd. That in the end the poor people shall
not be forgeten. ne their pacyente shall not perysshe / And also god enhauncyth
always the poor of spyryte And delyueryth them from all trybulacyons.

Fynably the same faders said to that right holy man saint Onuffryen That the
Aungelles contynuelly serve the Just and good. Which arne pe^fyghte in the
love of god / And their sowles ben Illumyned and kyndled with the light of
grace and of troth Saint Onuffryen when he hadd herd the fair Instruccyons
of these holy faders. Had the heart all embraced with great desire for to do
penance. and to fight against the devil / In suffrynge all pouertee. to the
end that he might come to the glory eternal / And thought in himself to
accomplysshe and perform the counseyll of the said prophet Dauyd. Techynge
and saying that it is a good thing to Join himself for the love of god / And
to set in him his hope /

When saint Onuffryen had althyse things considered. He took a little
bread and a few pesen or benes to make potage with all. for to live abowte a
four days.

After he departed by night secretly out of his abbaye / making his prayer
to god. That it might pleyse him to enseygne and show the place where he
should do his penance / And came in to a mountayn. The which he passed over
for to come in to deserte.

And he being there arrived and to men saw in a place tofore him a great
light The which as him semyd came strayghte to him / Whereof he was at^^de And
supposyd that it had sygn^fyed that be should return in his monast^rie /

In the said light he saw a man right playsaunte saying to him. that he
should no thing be aferde. for he was an aungel commysed and sent by god. and
departed for to govern and led him in the deserte / And after he laid to him
/ See that thou have thy heart right and Just / And be thou laboryous in good
works. for the angel said I shall not leave the unto the death At the
hour whereof I shall present the to the mageste of god.

After that they had walked abowte seven mile they aryued and came in to a
cave fair enough / In which saint Onuffryen found a another holy man / And
seenge him / he fell platt down to the earth. Demanding of him humbly his
benedyccyon and blessing. The which demanded / the same holy man took him
up / And kyssed him in token of peace. After he said to him thou shalt be my
brether in this deserte / And therefore come and enter in. in the name of god.
Which give to the grace to have to him ^euerente dread. In such wise that
all thyn operacyons and works be to him greble /

With this brother he abode many days forto enquire of his virtues and of his
manner of living. The which gaaf to him many enseynemens and ^^hortacyons how
he should live solytaryly and by what mean he should resyste and wythstonde
the temptaco^ns of the devil / Some days he made him to arise and to goo out
of his cave. saying to him My sone it is time that thou goo bens. for thou
may not dwell here / But thou shall goo in to a another ^ue. In which thou
shalt dwell all^ne / And if thou be strong and steadfast in the faith. Thou
shall put under thy fete all the temptacyons of the devil /

They tweyne together walked four days / And the fifthe they arcyued in a
place called Calidonia. by which were palms habundantly / When there weren in
the said place. He said to him. Now come hither my friend ^^ here the place
that god has prepared and made ready for the to serve him and to do thy
penance /

After that they were they arrived / The holy man was with him by the space of
thyrty days. In enfourmynge him always / And showing to him the Rules and
manners of living holy it / in keeping the commandments of the church /

After all these things / the said holy man made his prayer to god for saint
Onuffryen / And after took leave of him. And went again in to his cave /
Saint Onuffryen kept him. and abode in this said place^ in doing strayte
penance / And the holy Heremyte which had brought him thither. came for to
vysyte him every year. For to know of the conuersacyon of his living /

And on a time among the other in gooynge as he was accustomyd for to vysyte
saint Onaffryen / He fell to the ground and gaaf up his ghost to god /
Whereof saint Onuffryen was merueyllously trowbled and vexyd /

Fynably after that he had long wept upon the corpse. He buried it in the
same place / In the most honest wise that was to hy^ possible after his
little power

Paphunce which was also walkinge by the deserts When he had herd all
this that saint Onuffryen had recounted and showed to him / He said to him Ha
holy fader I know that many labors and pains thou have endured in this
deserte / Certain my brother said the holy man Thou may believe that I have
hadd so much pouertee in this deserte / That often times and for the most
part I estemyd my self to be at the term of my death / felt no strength
in me. Some time of the day I have been burnt with hete of the sonne^ In the
night I have be wasted with vapors and humyditees of the earth Many times I
have had great hungre and great thurst And shortly to say I can not
declare the merueyllous sorrows and afflyccyons that I have endured / But I
have hope that god shall reward ^e my reward / In gyuynge to me spyrytuell
rychesses. which encreace and augment every day. and never m^nysshe And for
to notefye to yt the bou^te of god which never leuyth his servants. He has
sent to me often times by one of his aungellis bread and water / Of which and
also of dates. which grow nighe by to my cave. and of some herbs I have had
suffisauntely my bodyly ref^ccyon /

After this he said to the holy man Paphunce / My friend if thou wolt
accomplisshe the will and commandment of god. Note and mark that he him
self has said. that we should not have any cure or business to ete. ne to
dry^ke. ne also of our vesture ne clothing / For god our fader wotyth and
knows all ye which to us is necessary / and therefore if in serving him well
we demand of him ye reame of heaven. without any fault we shall have all
those things that to us ben necessary /

After Paphu^ce asked of saint Onuffrie^ if he received often his maker. and how
he received him. To whom he ansuered. that the Saterdaye and ye Sunday.
thaungell of god brought to him the right precious body and blood of our
lord / And know ye for certain said saint Onuffryen. That all they that
virtuously vsentheyr lyffe in desert and wilderness ben parteners of such
Joy as I have /

All these things herd and considered by the holy man Paphunce He was so
perfightely rejoiced. that he remembered no more of all the sorrows and euylles
that he had endured and suffered in the deserts / So much him semyd the
word of the said holy man was sweet. and pleysaunt. Wherefore he might with
the psalmyste well say / O my god thy words ben to me more swetter than honey,
o^ other savors and sweet lycour /

Saint Onuffryen after brought him unto Celydoyne. three mile night to the
mountain where he had found him And when they were in ye place where he
dwelled / Onuffryen and he together put them in oryson and prayer / The which
done / Onuffryen said to Paphunce / O servant of god I see and know that thou
art in danger of death / If thou take not thy refeccyon A^yse thou and ete /
Paphunce would not ete ne drink. But at last he was constrained by the said
Onuffryen for to ete bread / They tweyne then together dranken and eten /

And after passed fourth all the night without slepynge. In speaking
contynuelly the words of god /

On the morninge erly saint Paphu^ce beholdynge the holy man Onuffryen saw his
vysage. which was also pale and dyffeated as of a deed man / Then he
demanded what thing he had / The holy man ansueryd to him and said / My
brother and friar Paphunce be no thing aferde / and know thou that by ye
will of god thou art comen unto this place / To the end to burye me. and lay
my body in the earth / Anon my soul shall depart fro my body. and shall be
borne in to the heavenly Reame / My brother I know thy desire and thy will /
And therefore when thou shalt be retournyd in to Egypte^ I pray the that
thou remember me and of my name / And to the end that thou and all thy
brethern be desiring to have of me remembrance. I shall say to the the
prerogatyues and special gifts that I have obtained of my lord and god
Rededemer of all the world /

First every person that shall make to him Immolacyon or sacrefyce be ^ in
messes or otherwise. in so dooynge have mind of my name. He shall be
preserved and kept from all frawdelous decepcyons. and temptacyons dyabolyke
and worldly / And at last be shall have partycipacion with the aungellis in
the reame of heaven /

And if any have no power to make the sacrefyce / And in gyuynge oonly for the
love of god and of me an asmesse to some poor man. Without fa^^e I shall pray
for him in heaven. to then de yt god make him worthi to have part of his
excellent glory. and yet if he may not do neither that one ne that other In
gyuynge a candell. or in making a little oblacyon. As encencynge with ^^ence.
or other offrynge / Certainly I shall so make prayer to god. To the ^^^e that
he have everlasting Joy / Paphunce herynge these all these ^^ynges. made to
him this demand ^^ question. Now fader if some or any person have no power
to do any of these three things / By what moyen may he do for to be in thy
recommendacyon and prayer / To the end that as what trybulacyon he be in /
thou make thine oryson for him / The holy man ansuered / My brother and friend
if it happed as thou say / That the suppliaunt have no facultee ne power to
do any of the things aforsayd. If he knele down on his knees. In lyftynge
his hondes Joined to god and saying deuowtly three times ye (Pater noster and
Aue maria) in the honor of the glorious Trinyte of heaven / and remember my
name / Surely I shall do so much anenste ye same right holy Trinyte that he
shall have part in the rea^e of heaven. with all the saints that been there /
Or if any be in doubt or hesytacyon of the things tofore said He may read
saint Iherom in his book which he has composyd in latin Intytulyd of the
life of faders / Of the which has be made this present tra^ssacyon. as in
other places has be said And there he shall see alonge this that is said
here tofore /

In retournynge to purpoos. the holy Paphunce was gretely content with the
words of saint Onuffryen And for asmoche as he reputed the same place where as
they were^ to be holy / he prayed to the said Onuffryen that he would give him
license to dwell there after his death / The which thing the good holy fader
would not But commanded him that he should return in to Egypt / And there
persevere in good works / For in the end he should have felycyte eternal /

When Paphunce had herd his ansuere. He knelyd down tofore the holy fader
Onuffryen. and said to him this that folowyth. Alas my dear fader and friend I
know. and believe that all that thou shalt demand of god. For the love of
whom thou haste be. lxx years in this deserte thou shalt lightly obteyne^
Then give to me now thy blessing. To the end that I be also perfyghte as
thou / The holy fader ansuered / My brother Paphunce be not angry For thy
demand shall be obtained / Be thou steadfast in the faith in serving god
with all thine heart. and with all thy thought / And by this moyen thou
shalt have eternal life / I pray to our lord that thou be kept always of
his worthy aungellis in all thy cogytacyons and wylles. To the end that thou
be clean and puryfyed tofore the face of Ihesu Christ When the holy man had
said all these words. He knelyd down to the ground / And in weeping said
O my god now in to thine hondes might puyssaunce and streyngthe I commend my
spyryte / And these words said suddenly came a great light / which
enuyronned all his body / Then after came many angels to great multitude /
which songen songs melodyous. Whereof all the air resowned. And bare the
soul unto the reame of heaven / Paphunce which herd those aungellis sing /
Began to weep and drown in teeres. saying / Alas I have well cause to make
lamentacyon. when with so great pain I have found the holy man Onufryen.
And hane be so little whyse with him / After when he had long waylled and
wepte^ He departed his garment in to two parts / And of that one he cladde
himself / And in that other he wound the body of the holy man. and put it
in a Sepulture of stone which was there / Paphunce seenge that he was there
alone. wept more thanne he did before / And supposyd to have entered in to the
cave of the holy man / But when he was at the entree a great part of the
roche fell down / By which he knew that god would not. that he should use
the resydue of his life in the said place / And so then he came again in
to his monastery in Egypt / Where as he recounted this bistorye like as tofore
is wreton / And the holy man saint Onuffryen deyed the twellyfth day of Iuyn.
the day of saint Barnabe the appostle /

Here folowyth the life of saint Abraham the Heremyte. And begynnyth in latin
Cupio. et cetera Caplm.li.
Saint Iherom willing to write the lyffe and maneres of saint Abraham thermyte
excused hy^ saying / When I consydre the life ange like above nature humayne /
that Abraham and thexcellence of his virtues. Uneath and with great pain. he
cowde were the words which should be suffisant to praise his merytes and
conuersaco^n / Fro his young days he ladde an angels life. for he lived ryt
chastely. Wherefore he was in the temple of our (...) Ihesu Christ. He had rich
fader and mother and friends / the which he being in right young aege made him
to acorde with a fair maid for to take her in marriage. Supposing to have
part him in office and dygnyte seculer But the good Abraham thought not to
live after the world / For all his felycyte and will was to haun^e the
chyrches. In herkenynge right affectuously the holy scripture / And to reteyne
it in his heart / To the end that when he should be out of the church / he
might have contemplacyon in the things dyuyne and heavenly /

So it happed that the time to halowe the Sacrament of marriage approached and
drew nyghe / But by cause that he would not abide thereby and persyste / His
parents and kynnesmen were angry with him so gretely that for the greyf that
he had of their heaviness. He concluded in himself to proceed forth therein /
Then the marriage of them solempnysed / And he being in his chamber. and
laid a bed with his spowse and wife / Suddenly there came upon him a fervent
will for to depart. and goo out of the cite / And so departed from thens.
that he was well two mile from the cite / Where he found a little house.
Wherein no man frequented nor vsyd / And entered in. and kept him there a
certain time prayenge and making devout prayers to god /

When his parents and kynnes^es knew that he was goon. they were much
angry / And for to seche him they sent messengers thorugh all the ^^untrer /
Which sought him by the space of ryghtene days / And at las^e some of them
in retornynge. entered in to this little house / Where they found him on his
knees prayenge to our lord. When the holy man saw them by him. And they
beholdynge him. he said to them / Wherefore be hold ye me so / Praise ye
with me ye name of god / Which has delivered me from the ordure and fylth
and wickydnesse of the world / Pray ye him for me. that he woll give me
might and strength for to bear the faytes of penance. which I have begone
/ After he prayed them that they would do to him none empesshement ne
lettynge And that no more they should come for to vysyte him there / Then
took they their leave and went their way / And Incontinent the holy man
stopped all the holes and openynges of his little house. except a little
wyndowe which he stopped not. to the end that by the same he might receive
his sustentacyon bodyly / And fro than forthou he dwelled there longe^
excercysynge himself with virtuous works. and living in clenuesse and
chastyte. In deuowte fastings. orisons. lamentaco^ns and wepynges in all
humylyte / His reno^me began to grow and to sprede thorugh all the country
/ By which many deuowte persons came contynuelly and without cessynge there
as he was. As well for to have of him consolacyon in their sorrows and
aduersytees. as to be Instruct and taught in doctrine and example of good
life /

Now god had given to him such a grace. that all the words that he spoke.
were so merueyllously agreeable to them that herd him / And lyghted them. as
the rays of the son light the world / Twelve year after his co^uersacyon
to god deyed his fader and mother / Which left to him gold and silver a
merueylous quantyte of ye which he being advertised sent anon Incontinent. to
one his famylyer friend. that he should dystrybute it for goddis sake to pore
orphans. and to other simple miserable persons. To the end that the thought
that he might have thereof. should not empesshe ne let him in his deuocyons.
orysons and contemplacyons He was aduertysed that it was so done. Whereof he
was gretely comforted. as he that after great traueylle / found himself in
rest and peasyble tranquyllyte / He appetyted not oonly to flee the world.
But also the goods of fortune / And for all erthely goods he had but one
robe or gown. Course and unthrifty clothe full of great here. With a little
dysshe in which he ete and drank / And a lytyl pay let whereon he lay.

His custom was to love as much ye poor as the Rich / And the vylayne / as
the noble / And generally in all the estates of the world he louyd asmoche
one as a another / If he corrected any he did it not with rude words / But in
great benygnytee and swetnes All they that herd him speak. or so kyd on him /
Always more and more they desired to see him / Never changed he the Rule that
he had begone And was continuelly by the space of fyfty year without to
have any report to the world / Right nyghe to the cite where he had be
nourysshyd there was a town where as dwelled paynems and Sarrasy^s / Unto whom
had been sent many Deakens and priests by some sovereign Bishops for to
co^uerte them unto the Christian faith / But all they were returned without
to have done any fruit / For the said Paynyms weren obstynate in their
ydolatrye / And it happed that ye pry^cypall of the said Bishops. being with
his clerks had knowledge of ye holy man Abraham / And said to them that it
was needful to send hy^ in to the said town. For by his pacyence and holy
life he might co^uerte them / The same Bysshopp then desiring to encreace
our holy faith accompanied with his clerks came in to the little house of
this holy man / And when he was there arry^^d / he salewed him. After he
admoneste^ and desired him to goo in to the said town saying / O my friend I
know that thou art agreeable to god. which never refusyth to the no thing
yt thou of him demaundest / Also thou knoweste enough the Paynems dwelling in
this next town. And how we can not find manner to convert them. Wherefore
it byhouyth that thou goo for to admonest and styre them ^^ke as god shall
enseygne and (...) the. The holy man was much ^^^^bled of the office that the
bysshopp ^^de give to him. And ansuered to him. O my lord I pray yt the thou
(...) suffer me to bywepe my wyckidnesse and that I depart not from here. I
we^e well said the bisshopp that thou ^^ste left the world. and renounced
all erthely goods. for the bliss of heaven. But nevertheless if thou had
all the virtues of the world. and thou have none obedyence. they should no^
^^ge prouffyte the / The holy man ansuered to him / Alas my lord I and (...)
other thing but a deed bound. What thynkeste thou to be my life / Wherefore
sayste thou so much good of me /

Then said to him the bysshopp. I say the to be servant of god. Which
sechest in this place where thou art in but thy health oonly / But thou goo
where I woll send the. Thou shall be cause of the health of Infenite persons
by the grace that god shall give to the Ne think not oonly to do thyn health
/ But also that which bylongyth to thy neighbors / And then shalt thou
have very charity / And by this moyen thou shalt get more great merit
anenste god. In so much as thou shall bring with ye many souls in to heaven /

The holy man herynge the bishop And desiring as very obedyente to co^ferme
him to his good playsure. ansuered to him. that he was all ready to go where as
it should playse him / Wherefore the bysshopp seenge his right good will. laid
his hand upon his heed / and constytuted him a priest / And after he brought
him to the said town And in entering in the which he said / O my god right
pyteuous I byseche the. that it may playse the to behold my great pouertee.
Freelte. Imbecyllyte and the debylyte of mine ygnorau^ce / Enlarge upon me thy
grace. And that now thou help me to gloryfye thy holy name.

When he was arrived there. seenge their folysshe ydolatrye / He moeuyd with
pity. began to waylle and weep In making his prayer to god inlthys manner /
O my god which art oonly without sin. Now I praise the that it playse the
to have mercy on thise miserable synnars / Helas my god these ben thy
creatures. they ben the work of thyn hondes. Suffer them not to be lost /
These things thus said. byholdynge that he might not have them by prompte
predycacyon. He sent to his famylyer friend. that he should selle all his
patrymonye / which was of great revenue and that he should send him the money
thereof. Which he so did / And with the money that he received / did do
make a fair church. Honestely arrayed. and made fair the best wise that he
might.

During the time that the church was in making. From day to day he walked
by the temples of thydolles of the said towne^ Making in his heart prayer to
god and no thing to ydollis / And after that the said church was achyeued
and made. He made in ye same his orison saying / O my god which haste by thy
presence and predycacyon dystroyed all ydolatrye of the world. When at
thy natyuyte the ydollis of the temples fell down. thou see the people of
this town far from thy very faith. Setting their hertes and thoughts to
serve ye devil. in making to him ho^mage / Vouchesauf thou now my god in
such wise to ensumyne them. that they may leave their symylacres and
ydolatryes. To the end that they may know the one oonli god of heaven and of
the earth / Inco^tynent his oryson achyeued and ended as he had had an hundred
thousand men with him he entered in the temple of the Paynems ydolatrers. and
brake and did to fall down their aulters and ydolles / And they seeng his
manner of doing. as hounds enraged beat and hurt him. in such wise that he
was all full of wounds and of hurtes. And so came again in to his church.
And how well he was hurt and tormented / He thought no thing on his
wounds. But all the night with all his heart prayed to god devoutly for the
conuersyon of the poor Infydelis and ydolatrers / The morn comen. thiwente in
to his church. Where they found him in oryson and prayer. But they cowde not
do to him any harm ne dysplaysure / And beholdynge the ornaments and
decoracyon of the said church. Suddenly they took playsure to see and
behold them.. In such wise that thoue and the other came chyder every day
in manner of pass time / By cause the said church semyd to them much honest
and playsaunt /

On a day among the other he prayed them. and admonested to leave their
ydollis And that they should know their maker. Which might save them and
dampne them. In making to them many fair exhortacyons for to endure them
in the says But in herynge that thee were more enraged thanne tofore / And
beat him somoche. that they supposyd to have slain him. And after they bound
him with i^ cord. And drew him out of their ^^te. and left him in the field.
where he abode so bounden unto mydnyghte

Then he returned toward god. to whom in wayllynge and weeping he said / O
my god. why haste thou forsaken thy poor servant. Alas my Savior. Now
behold thou with pity thy poor dyscyple / And give to me streng the to fight
against thise Infydeles / With this my god I pray the. that it may playse the
to give to them a little of thy grace / To the end that they know the as
their god. His prayer achyeued. he returned to his church. and said his
psalms and orysons accustomyd / The Paynems in like wise as they had been
accustomed returned in to his church. But when they saw that he was
returned. without mercy they beat him more thanne tofore. and drew him
again out of the cite /

The holy mas was by the spa^e of three year suffrynge all such pains as the
said Infydelis did to him / But all their torments and hu^gre and thirst
he bare pacyentely. without trowblynge himself / And so much as they
martred him. So much more be louyd them / And always he admonessed the most
ancient of them as his faders. How be it they were against him much
furyous. And the young men as his brethern / and the adolocentes as his
children / And notwythstondynge all this. They all mockyd him /

Now it happed upon a day. that by the grace of god. all they of the town
assembled. for some of their affairs and besynesses / And after that they had
delybered and concluded. They began^e to speak of the holy man Abraham. in
woundrynge how pacyentely he endured without murmr all their repreues and
Injuries that they did to him And ferthermore they said that he was necessary
for to endure for the honor of his god. Whom he preached to be only lord of
heaven and of earth.

They thought also how he himself alone had broken and distroyed al their
ydollis. Without that their goddis had done to him any greyf or lettynge /
And fynably concluded that his faith was true / And that they ought to believe
all that he said / For he was the very servant of god / And this conclusyon
thus made^ all togider unto the nombre of a thousand. or there abowte came in
to his church / And with one voys began to say. Glory rybe to god of heaven
/ which has sent to us his servant for to delyuere us from our error /
The holy man this seenge was replenysshed all with gladness / And adressynge
to them his words said to them. O my faders my brethern and mi children
draw ye nyghe to me / And give glory and honor to god our maker / Which by
his grace has Illumyned you in such manner as ye may lyghtely know him /
And to the end that ye ben clean for all the spots of Ydolatrye. I pray
you to believe in him / And love him with all your heart and all your
thought. As him which that is very god And oonly lord of all the world.
which is without end and beginning / Inestymable. Inenarrable.
Incomprehensible. Almighty. Giver of light. Lover of men. Terrible to synnars.
And sweet to Just and rightwys men /

Believe also on the sone. which is the sapyence and wysdom of the fader. and
of the goly gooste / Which quycke nyth all things / To the end that ye that
are poor. Which ben no thing ellis but earth may be purified and enhauncyd
to the reame of heaven.

All they ansueryd that they byleued like as he had said / And Incontinent
he baptized them all. in the name of the fader. and of the sone. and of the
holy gooste / After that they were baptized. every day he taught and
endoctrined them in the good holy scriptures. In speaking of the Joys of
heaven. and of the pains of hell / After he excyted them to get the virtues
of Faith. Hope. Charity. Prudence. and other. And for to enduce to get them
he lived with them like an angel. In making to them diverse predicacyons.
the which he continued an hole year / And after that he knew them confermed
in the faith / One time among the other. he being at hour of mydnyghte in
contemplacyon Made unto our Savior Ihesu christ such a prayer saying. O
thou Illumyner of all the world. which haste enlumyned this lityll people.
and haste losyd them from the bonds of the devil in gyuynge to them science
for to know the / I humbly require the my god that thou wolt keep them unto
the end. holding them in thine holy faith To the end that they may do
such thing always. that may be to the agreeable And to me also by thy mercy it
be not imputed that I depart from them For my lord god thou know that do
it to the end that I be not wythdrawen from dooenge penance.

His orison accomplysshed and made an end. He made three times the sign of the
Cross upon the said town. And departed thens. And went in to a place where
as no body dwelled / On the morn the Inhabytauntes and dwellers of the said
town came in to his church like as they were acustomed But they fond him
not. Whereof they were much sorrowful and angry. And went weeping and
wayllynge sechinge him / And wenynge to find him sought him in many places /
But they cowde not after he was departed find him. After word of his
departing came to the bysshopp. Whereof he was as much dysplaysaunt as they
were / And for as much as sheep without Pastoure ben in danger of the wulfe /
He would not leave them without a co^duytour and guide /

So came he himself in to the said town for to comfort them. And after
that the said bisshopp had the most sonyngly that he cowde comforted them
He choos some of the most notable men among them whom he constytuted in holy
ordres. making some of them priests. and some deakens.

And if they had any trybulaco^ns or empesshements in their cons^yences They
went to the said men so ^a^^ed /

The holy man Abraham when he knew how the bysshopp had given to them
socours for their health / He rendered thankynges to god / In loving and
gloryfyenge his name. And held him close in a little house. There prayenge and
thankinge god in great Joy and cru^tacyon.

O man of great perfecco^n. In what manner may any man praise thy charity and
thy great constaunce. When for the health of thyn neighbors. thou haste
endured so many euilles.

And nevertheless thou haste not left to make thy prayers and say thine
orysons accustomyd. Thou haste not varyed for all their menaces and torments.
But haste perseuered unto the end / O charytable man which haste put thy body
in danger of thine enmyes for to make to them health.

Well may thou be fellow to saint Stephen the first martyr. which prayed
to god for them. that mart^rd hy^ The enmye of all good men seeng the
conversation of the holy man. and also that for tribulacyons he cessed not from
his good purpoos But always he puryfied himself. as gold in the fr^nays. Came
to assaylle him on a time at mydnyghte. as he was in his prayer. And
concluded to tempte him by such temptacyons. That he should no more be in
wilderness. But should return in to the world. Then came the devil
suddenly with a great light. clear as the son. Wherwyth he enlumyned all
the lityll house / And in the light was a voys which said /

O holy man Abraham thou shalt be well happy. For in all thy works thou
haste be true. And haste all done after my will / The holy man knew that it
was the devil. Ansuer^d with an high voys. Goo hens thou wicked and perverted
admynystrer of malice. Come thou now hither for to te^pte me with vain
glory / I knowleche that I am a great synnar / And thou weneste that I repute
myself Just Away and goo cursyd spyryte in to the vttrest derkenesse / In to
which you art condemned / By the grace of my blessed god I shall no thing
fere thy falaces / and dysceytful mockynges and lesynges / The name of Ihesu
Christ whom I honor and love. shall be my deffence and wall against the.
when thou shalt come for to assail me / And Incontynente the devil
departed / The devil came again and brought with him a clubbe for to break
down his little house. And when he had made open that one side / The devil
said faynynge that he had with him many evil knaves. To whom he said / Come
hither my friends. haste you. let us entree in^ And slay this papelart /

The holy man began to say: O my god all folk have enuyronned me But thy
name be praised. by which I shall overcome them. And shall bring under my
fete all mine enmyes /

And Incontinent the devil vanisshed away / A little while after the devil
retournyd / And putt fire in to a little matte on which he knelyd maky^ge his
prayers And when he saw the fire without feer he quenchyd it saying / I
shall by the might of god walk upon aspydes and venymouse beestes / And
trede under my fete the lion and the dragon. and all the power of mine enmye /
For my god shall give to me always aid and strength for to fight against the
/ Sathanas seenge that he was condemned of ye holy man cryeed with an high
voice saying / I shall vaynquysshe the. and make the to deye and evil death /
For I shall find so many cautelles and discepcyons that thou shalt not cunue
endure them /

It happed on a day like as the holy man should ete / The devil transformed
him in to the form and shappe of a little child / And entered in to ye little
house / And supposyd to have turned the plater up sodoune / The holy man took
him by the hand and held him fast till he had taken his refeccyon / Anon
after the devil went his way / And a little while after returned and
brought a candelstyk. under which was a candell light. And presented tofore
the holy man / which took his refeccyon / And the devil syngy^ge said / Well
happy ben the walkers of this world that walken without spotte of sin / And
sange so many verses of the psalm that begynnyth (Beati immaculati i via qui
ambulant in lege dn^i) But the holy man ansuered no thynge^ till that he hadd
taken his refeccyon /

And when he had taken his refeccyon. he armyd with constaunce spoke to the
devil saying these words / Thou hounde Infamyd right miserable and liar of
all liars / sith that thou knoweste them that been happy and humble servants
of god. Wherefore ye ueste thou to them heaviness and lettynges that they may
not do their penaunces such as they desired / The devil ansuered that the
cause wherefore he trowbled the servants of god / was to the end that they
should leave their good conuersacyons. and abandonne and give them to sin /
Then^e the holy man said to him / Thynkeste thou spyrite Infamyd. that they
that been ferme in the love of Ihu^ Christ may be deceived by thy suggestions.
Thou deceyuest none. but them that been unhappy And ben content to do thy
will / And that worse is they done pain to sin mortally / Thou know when
the servants of god ben assaylled of the / That by one prayer that they make
to god. thou art constrained to flee / And Incontinent as the holy man hadd
said these words / The devil fled away as a raye or beme of the son.

Yet again five days after came ye devil. And made in the air a noise / as
he had hadd a great multitude of people / That one saying to that other Let
us goo and throw Abraham into a dyche. and put him to death /

The good holy man when he herd these words sayede / The enmyes of god have
gone round abowte me as flies or bees. and ben enforcyd against me as fire in
thorns All be done in the name of god our lord Ihesu Christ / For by the
puyssaunce dyuyne I shall vaynquysshe the cursyd devil /

After that the enmye had herd these words of the said good holy man / He
began to cry. saying / Helas. Helas. I know no more by what manner ne by
what moyen the to dysceyue. I know now that I am dysceyued / Nevertheless I
shall never depart fro the unto the time thou render thyself to be my subgette
/

Then the holy man ansuered to him. Maledyccyon come to the / Glory be given
unto god. and no thing unto the / Thou knoweste that our sauyoure and
redemptour Ihesus gyuethe to all his true servants strength to fight against
the. and knowledge of thy dysceyuable temptacyons and mockynges. for to keep
them from thy mortal and dampnable grynnes.

By many assawtes was assailed the holy man Abraham of the devil our enmye.
But of what some ever temptacyon that he was tempted with. He never fered ne
doubted / but had always steadfast faith / And of so much more as he was
tempted. vexid. and traueylled of the devil / Of so much more he augmented
his charytee toward god / Wherefore fro day to day encrecyd his grace / And by
that lightly by the help of god. he suppedyted and put under foot the devil /

When the holy man apperceyued that the tresoure of grace was to him ottroyed
and given. He took three precious stones / Of which the first was Faith. The
second Hope / And ye third Charity. To the end that by these three. the other
virtues might be decorate and made fair / His charity was so great. that it
stratched not oonly to good men / For whom he prayed affectuously / to the end
that the devil should not grieve ne noye them / But also he desired the
conuersyon of ye evil people. in prayenge in like wise for them. And in
weeping great habundau^ce of teeres / To the end that god would dyuerte them
from their evil life / and turn them to the way of health / He never
laughed / And never after his conversion wysshe his feet ne his hondes^ ne his
vysage / Estemynge every day that he should deye. /

He had his vysage not like the flower that never dries / And in seenge him by
his vysage^ he should be Iuged to be a vessel full of all vertues^ Always he
was Ioyeous without heaviness / And for that cause at hour of his death he
was Iuged never to have do penance so much was his visage fayte and rodye /
And that more is. in fyfty year he changed not his garment of hair / Which
he took and had worn sith he began to do penance first / By the which
things it apperyd euydently that he was strongely the friend of god /

A another miracle did the holy man Abraham in his old aege / He had a cosyn
germayn / Which departed out of this world. and deyed. leuynge after him a
daughter seven year of aege /

The friends of the said child secuge that she had neither fader ne mother /
brought her to the holy man / where as she was enclosyd nyghe by to a wyndowe.
which was on the side of his little house. And by the same wyndowe he taught
to her the Psaulter. and other holy scryptures / And there in so dooyng and
saying Ympnes and psalms they were long together / In such wise / that in
all abstynences the young maid ensyewed her uncle Abraham / The which seeng
the good way and will by her begone / He deuowtely and without cessynge prayed
god for her / To the end that he would give to her such grace that she never
sold return to the world. And that her thought should have none affection
to worldly things / For he had thereof great doubt. by cause that her fader
had left to her great plentee of goods temporell / The which goods
Abraham seenge her great prudence and perfeccyon. made them to be dystrybuted
to the pore people / In prayeng god that the deuylles by their subtle
suggestyons might have no power to change her from her good purpoos /

So continued long time the good maid in the rule that her uncle had given
to her / And she had in her so great constaunce. that in twenty years he
found not her varyable / But obeyssaunte as a young lamb or sheep / During
this time. the devil which slepyth not. ymagyned many subtle means. by
which he might dysceyue them / And by cause he cow ^e in no wise come to
his entente / He did do begyle and disceyued her by a miserable Relygyous /
The which were often to vysite the said good man Abraham. Faynynge so to do
for the salvation of his soul / But the cursyd Relygyous man tempted of the
devil under the shadow of devotion. He went for to defoyle the said vyrgyn /
And so long he continued by the space of a year. that he drew her out of
her Oratorye / And by cause that in such caas the less to know and express
is best and most honest / It suffyseth to write that the poor daughter was
defoylled / And that after the sin commysed and done / she became so
sorrowful and desolate. that uneath may be expressyd and written her
lamentacyons and waylynges. And then she began to tere her here. and to
beat her breast and her vysage. Enforcing her self for to slay herself by
dyspayr.

And thus in lamenting and bewailing. she bewaylled merueylously her
vyrgynyte so lost / And ferthermore / She said Alas me poor synnar I have
lost all the time in which I have done penance / All mine orysons /
Fastings. and good operacyons and works ben by me synnar lost. O ye teeres
and w^pynges may not redememe / O my uncle which is so much so perfighte
What shame and dyshonoure have I done to the / Certainly I now fere me that the
wrath of god shall hastily fall upon me / that am made Illusyon and mocked
of the devil Alas what shall prouffyte me from hensforth to do penance / It
were better for me to deye thanne to live / O very god. What sin have I done.
Alas my maker how have I co^mysed and done against the such offense How have I
be so blind in my thought Ne how have I be so ygnoraunte ne had no
knowledge of that which I ought to do Ne where or what shall come of me. Alas
where ben the good mony^sons and warnynges that mine uncle said and warned me
of when I was vyrgyne And that I had purposyd to have kept my soul
Inmaculate and vndefoylled to Ihesu Christ my spowse /

Alas I am not worthy to behold ye heaven. for I am deed as towchynge the
world / And as toward god I dare not return to my wyndowe / by which I
sprange and came out / Alas how I that am full of Inyquyte and wyckydnesse.
shall I be hardy enough to speak to mine uncle / I suppose if I return to my
little house / Incontinent if I come and approach and come nyghe to the
wyndowe. by miracle shall fire to me that shall brenne me /

After these pyteous by wayllynges ye poor synnar out of her wit as deed
and far from her health went her way in to a another cite / and changed her
habyte / And after went to an house where as dwelled common wy^men. Now it happed
that her uncle knew her syn^e / by a reuelacyon which was such /

In his sleep he dremyd that he saw a dragon merueylous great and so fer^ful
that he durst not behold it / The which in syflynge enforcyd him to approach
and come nyghe his chamber or little house / And him semyd ferthermore that in
coming nyghe the same place the same dragon found a down. ye which he
deuowred / And after he had deuowred it. he retornyd thither fro whe^^ be came
And when the holy man Abraham a woke He began to weep estemynge that the
devil would set scysme and dyuysion in ye church. or that many christian men
should be turned fro the holy faith. And so ye good holy man wyste not what to
do. sauf to pray to god. that it might playse him to let him have knowledge
what the said vysyon betokened And two days after he had a another dreme like /
And him semyd when the said dragon came nyghe to his house. he putt his heed
under his fete. and was divided in two parties / After the which vysion the
holy man saw within the belly of the said dragon the said down. which he had
devoured. And him semyd that the douue was alive / And then Incontinent the
holy man put his hand in the said belly / And drew out the down a live /
Then^e he a woke after that / and wenynge to have found his nyece Marye in her
Oratorye. Came smiting at her wyndowe. and called her two or three times And
by cause that sith ii. days he had not herd her in her oratory and prayers.
He ymagyned and bileued that the vysyon was of his nyece Wherefore he fell down
to the ground in making merueyllous lamentacyons and wayllynges. and said.
Alas what is now happened to me / My daughter is now prisoner in ye prison of
the devil / O cursyd wulfe rauysshynge. Thou haste rauysshed my sheep / O
savior of all the world give to me a gift. That is that my sheep may come
again in to her fold. tofore er I deye / To the end that in perpetuell
ennoye I finysshe and end not mine old aege / My god despise not my prayer But
hastily good lord enlarge upon me thy grace. to the end that she may be
delivered from the golette of the dragon.

The poor daughter was two year living in lubrycyte and lecherye. bounden
with the bounds of the devil. and englotted in his belly / During the which
two year. the holy man Abraham prayed contynuelly to god. That it playsed him
to reduce and bring her again to penance /

I these two years the holy man send a famylyer friend of his for to search
and seche in what place she might be The which went and fond her. and
brought word where she was. and had seen her in an open house with common
wymmen / The holy man anon did do opene his house. and went out of it
secretly / To the end that he should not be known he took the habyte of a
seculer man / And did on a great hode. and mufflyd his vysage. by cause he
would not be known /

Now let us consydre the comparyson and simylytude of the first Abraham. And
of the second. of whom this present hystorye makyth mencyon /

The first went in to the battle against four kings / And rescowed and
brought home his neuewe Loath Which was prysonner / The second went also to
bataylle against the devil. For to redeem his nyece. which was prysonner.
and kept and holden in thraldom and capty^^te of sin. to which she was
submysyd and given / For to return then to this present hystorye. the holy
man Abraham thus habilled and arrayed as said is. lepe upon an horse that he had
borrowed for to make this vyage And so long rode by his Iourneyes. that he
arrived in ye house where as his nyece was. And he being comen thider by cause
he saw her not among the other young wy^men which were there demanded of the
hooste if there within were any young woman named Marye / The which hooste
wenynge that the holy man were come for to commyse and perform his lecherye.
Ansuerd to him that there with in was such one. Which he said was as fair as
one might see / Gentle and honest of body / And that she had in her body
none deformyte / The which words herynge the holy man was merueylously Joyous
/ And prayed him that she might come forth. For he would ete and drink with
her. Incontinent the host brought her tofore her uncle. prowdely and worldely
arrayed and cladde. As comynly ben these unthrifty common wymmen /

The holy man when that he saw her in that estate. was much heavy and
sorrowful / But nevertheless he dissymyled his anger the best wise he might
without to make any knowledge. Dredinge that she should have known him. ^eest
Incontinent she should withdraw her. and hid herself / After they wythdrew
them in to a little chamber. where as they began to ete / And in taking
their refeccyon together. the holy man began to play with her. in beholdynge
her benygnely and louyngly / And by cause that in so dooynge she had some
remembrance of her uncle. She that was set tofore hym^ and knew him not.
Aroos sodeinly and came and collyd him with both her arms. having
remembrance of time passed. In which she had in so great and perfyghte
devotion toward our lord Ihesu Christ / And knowleged to him her courage.
the which she might no longer hyde. And began Incontinent to weep and to
sorrow. in casting out of her eyes great habundance of teeres. and in
cursynge her miserable and wretchyd life /

Then the hoosteler all abashed began to say / Ha lady Mary what causyth
you to weep now. It is two years sith ye came hither / and I saw you never
angry / To whom she ansuered / Alas I had be well happy if I had be deed three
years goone / The holy man seenge her lamentacyons and wepynges. began to say
to her / Ha ha my daughter. thou were right now so Ioyouse / And now thou
wepest the sy^nes that thou haste done / I pray the leave this purpoos / And
make me good thyere / How much is the great goodness of our lord which
never woll lose the synnars. But by his great mercy woll call them again /

The poor Marye seenge the holy man / How be it she had in her ymagynacyon
and demynge. that it was a another which resembled and was like him /
Nevertheless she had never byleued that it had been he. Considering that he
that was a man of right holy life. And would never have entered in to that place
somoche dyshonest Now let us consydre fro whens came this contrycyon so
sudden to this poor synnar / Truly we ought to believe that it proceeded fro
ye benign mercy of god. Which beholdynge the great wayllynges and deuowte
orysons. which ye holy man Abraham made for her that he should not lose his
pains ne laburs / The holy man then^e required of thoost. yt he should make
them good there / As took to him a pyece of gold. which was of good valewe
that he had broghte with him / For he was comen^om far for the love of the
pore May / O merueyllous prudence O di^^eco^n inenarrable. the good holy man
ad be fyfty year without etynge of any read / Nevertheless for to with draw
is nyece from that place publyke. he ^as content to ete flesh and to drink
^^ne After that they had supped the pore daughter Marye prayed the holy mn to
goo to bed. to the which he agred and acorded / But when he saw theedde so
well arrayed and hye lift up fr^ the ground. he was much abashed
Notwythstondynge he sat thereupon / After came to him Marye for to draw of his
hosyn and shone / And by cause the door was open of ye chamber he co^^aunded
that she should goo shette it fyrte / After yt she had shett the door. he made
her to come to him / and took her by the ho^de. as he would have kyssed her /
The ho^ man which might no longer hyder and cover his thought demanded her
/ Come hither my daughter know tho^ me noute. Am not I he that so long have
nourysshed the. O mi daughter what have thou done. Who has plu^ged thein
sin. Where is now thine angelyke habyte / Where ben now thy long and worthy
prayers. Alas thou were a^hau^sed up in to heaven. And now thou art descended
in to hell / Whe^^ore my daughter Inco^tynent as thou had co^mysed ye
syn^e came thou not to me / and let me have knowledge thereof. certes I would
then^ have done ^enaunce for the. Alas what dredest thou. no man may be
without sin but oonly god our sovereign protector In heringe thise words
Mary became as immovable And when ye holy man saw that she ansuerd not again.
he said yet to her / Marye my right daughter which art of my blood speak to
me if it playse to the. and take consolaco^n and comfort / For I promise to
the that I shall take thy sin upon me. And shall take on me the penance for
to render acounte. and dyscharge the tofore god the right merciful redemer of
all the world / There were they two together to mydnyghte in she wynge of the
good holy man to Mary his nyece the great mercy of god And after that she had
long herd him. she began to speak in weeping great teres. and said to him /
A my fader and my uncle I am not worthy to be present tofore thine eyes / Alas
how may I have remyssyon / What prayer shall I make to god. that am so
horrible defoyled and maculate of so many sins / Then^e yet the holy man for
to comfort her ansuerde saying / My daughter and my love. Thine Inyquytees be
upon me and no thing upon the. I have prayed to god that it may playse to
take ye punysshment on me. And truly I make no doubt but that he shall so
do Therefore come with me. and return we to our place in which we have lived
so long togider virtuously / you shall se Effren thy friend which is full of
sorrow of thy perdyco^n / Have no mystruste of ye merci of Ihesu Christ / How be
it that thy sins ben gretter in enormyte thanne the great mountains and
hills / Yet his mercy is much more great / Take then hope in considering /
That it is no new thing to fall in to syn^e But it is a right great danger
to abide therein long / When one is fall in it. I believe fermely that the
fend which has the feeble in falling. He shall find the strong in
releuynge and rysynge /

My daughter thou see that I am aunceyen and old / Wherefore I pray the that
thou have pity on mine old aege. And that thou come out of this publyk place.
and return in to thy first lodging for to do there thy penance

God woll not that the synnars should deye eternal death. but desires that
they should live perpetuelly Then she said to him. If thou know well my
fader that I may do suffisaunt penance in such wise that I may deserve to
have remyssyon of my sins I woll well that we return where it shall playse
the /

In such deuyses and lamentaco^ns was Marye all the night at the feet of
the said holy man her uncle / To whom also she said. alas my lord what shall I
mow give or reward the for thy good grace and mercy that in so great desire
and affection thou purchasyst to me / On the morn by time when they should
depart and goo their way She said to him / Mine uncle I have spared and have
here within a little gold and other vestures say to me what it playsyth the
that I shall do wythal To whom the holy man said I woll my me^e. that thou
leave here in this place Infamyd all those gods yt thou have gotten by sin and
Infamye for they benot worthy to be give for go^ is sake to the poor people /
So thene they departed from that dyshoneste p^ce / And so much exployted
their ^ye / yt fynably they came to the place here before she hadd be nourisshyd
/ An was remysed in to her little chamber clad with her old cote /

Think now what sorrow and complaints they made after that / me weeping every
day the holy ma for the sin of his nyece. Like as h^ had commysed himself /
and showed ^e great enormyte thereof more bitter than^e he durst have done. or
he hade brought her thither / O merueyllus and Inestymable charity. that ^^ to
redeem ye soul of his niece. he wa^ ^ontent to by^de hy^self to do penaun for
her / Who shall be he that without wayllynge and weeping shall rememb^ the
merueylous lamentacyons that they did after her reducco^n fro synn to penance
/

Who is also he the would not render also thankynges to god of such a
conuersyon / She was after that of so honest a life and conuersacyon That
many notable pe^sones from diverse places came to her ^or to be comforted in
their aduersytees ^^y the moyen of her prayers and orisons.

Ten year after lived the devout ^holy man Abraham. The which seenge the great
penaunces ^^ his nyece. lo^yd her better and more herte^ than he hadd done
before / and of her virtuous life rendered contynuelly thankynges right devoutly
to god / And when he had attained tha^ge of lx. year / and his ^^ year fyfty.
They rendered their souls to god which gaaf to them his glory and felicyte
eternal / The which give to us. the fader the sone and the holy ghost / Amen

Of saint Pachomyen abbot. and begynnyth in latin Dominis noster thu^s. etc.
Caplm.lii.


IN recitynge of saint Pachomyen and of many other saints. and holy faders.
Saint Iherom says in substance / Our lord Ihesus fountain of all sapyence
and light of very doctrine sone of god the fader / by the virtue and
puyssaunce of whom all has been created and made. willing to show our poor
freelte of the enormyte of sin. which is so much enclyned to us has
showed by his right worthi pite and mekenes many ways and manners to seche our
health. Considre we then the grace that he gaaf to Abraham our ancient
fader. When in obeyenge to his commandment. he would have offered Ysaac his
first sone. He was content with the obeyssaunce of Abraham. which had mede
and merit of his sacrefyce / And yet abode his sone alive. All the prophets
which have had so many reuelaco^ns / And that knew that god might not lie.
have showed to us that there should come a medycyne. or leche which should
heel all our sores and wounds That is our lord Ihesu Christ. Which by his
passion has bought and redeemed us from the pains of hell / He is so humble
that never he dyspisyth our petycyons / So that they ben reasonable and
helthfull. And also that they ben demanded with a contryte and humble heart.
Considre we also the grace that we have whan^e by the sacrament of baptym we
ben regenerat and purifyed of origynall sin^e of our first fader Adam / And
also we have herd the appostles which have endoctryned us in the holy faith
/ which we hold and keep / When the same our faith began to be
publysshed. The devil our great enmye supposyd by his temptacyons to have
brought to naught all Cristyante. But so as we reden many saints by
prayers and other afflycco^ns lightly putt them under / Some Paynems emperors
Romans after the passion of our lord enforcid hem to persecute cryste^ men of
whom many went in to Egypt. the which unto ye death endured great martyrdom
for the honor of Ihesu Christ / And from day to day the chirches were
augmented. edefyed and made in the name of the martyrs. Some other forsook the
world / And vseden all their life in wilderness in deserts / As of many is
wryton here tofore / The some were cladde with heyrof ghotes / Other did
penance in fasting an hoole weke without etynge: Endurynge all their life
in cold and hete. and other necessitees Innumerable / And in so doing have
opteyned of our lord synguler prerogatyues As it has enough be declared in
the lives of holy faders here tofore wreton

conuersacyon of saint Anthonye / Saint Anathase bysshopp of Alexandrie has
made many great and fair witnesses. Which ben things much prouffytable to

were the fon^dement and beginning of Religyon / And of whom in their lyuy^ge

people in Thebayde. But after the persecucyon of Dyoclesyan and Maxymyan
emperors and tyrau^tes Inhumayn. Many persons of diverse settes followed the
law of Ihesu Christ / For some went into desert. and other in to Religyon /
And then began the church to flourysshe and multeplye.

How the said Pachomien would be Christian / And begyn^yth in latin Peridem

IN the same time dwelled Pachomien in Thebayde the which was a Paynem.
Holding the law in which his fader and mother had enfourmyd him. But after
by ye grace of god he would be Christian And how well that in his adolesce^nt he
was Paynem / as tofore is said Nevertheless he was much virtuous And also
sith his conversion he prouffyted merueyllously in acquysico^n of virtues. In
such wise that by the moyen of his right holy lyffe he was much reno^myd in
diverse countrees and Regions in like wise as more amply shall be declared
herafter.

How in his young aege be distroyed the Ydollis / and begyn^ith in latin / Her

THis said Pachomyen in his young aege. being yet a child was brought by his
parents as to a temple of ydolatrye. being by the river of Nyle. for to
adoure and sac^rfye the ydolles / The priest sacrylege would make sacrefyce
when they were come after their dampnable and wicked law / But the devil
would not give ansuere as he hadd be accustomyd to do. Whereof the folysshe
preeste was much abashed / And fynably the devil showed to the cursyd priest
/ that the goddis would give none ansue ^t. but yt Pachomyen were expulsid out
of the same temple / His parents were much angrye when they saw him
constrained to depart from them. And wiste not what they should do

A another time he being replenysshyd with the grace of god / As one gaaf him
to drink of the wine that had be sacrefyed to the ydolles / Incontynente he
casted it up again by manner of vomyte. Like as it had be poison.
Notwythstondyng that he was not yet Christian /

Eodem tempore. et. cetera Caplm.lvi.
IN the same time Constantyn obteynynge the Empire of rome did constrayne all
the young men of his country for to habylle and put them in arms for to
serve him in his war / Emonge whom he was retained to wages / The said
Pachomyen which then was in the aege of twenty years / After that he was put
upon the sea / The wind aroos / And made them to arryue in a cite in which
dwelled Christian men / When they of the cite saw them come. lyberally they
received them / And honestly they admynystred to them all their necessitees
/ Pachomyen seeng^ ^^yr charity and humanytee inquired ^^ his fellows. what men
they were / Which ansuered to him that they were christian men / And that their
custom was to be so humble and charytable to all the world Hopinge to have
therefore reward of their god.

Pachomyen herynge this was much heavy in his heart for that he might not have
none other knowledge of them Wherefore he made his prayer to god in saying / O
god almighty which haste made heaven and earth grant thou to me my prayer.
That is. that it playse the to give me perfighte knowledge of thy name / And
that I be delivered of the oblygacyon in which I Am bound. And I shall be thy
servant all the time of my life / And I promitte to the that I shall renounce
the world for to beye ye only / He then^e retornynge frothe war with his
fellows they passyd by diverse countrees and Regyons in which some time
Pachomyen was tempted with the sin of the flesh / But nevertheless rme^bryng
of ye promise that he hadd made to god. he resisted ye temptaco^n. And would
never co^mise the said sin Desiring for the love of our lord to live
chastely /

How Pachomyen received the holy Sacrament of baptim / And bgynnyth in latin
Igitur constantinus. etc Caplm.lvii^
IT happed that Constantyn ye Emperor of Rome after that he was Christian. And
that by ye faith and credence that he had to god He had opteyned vyctorye
against his adversaries. Concluded for to dyscharge his subgettes of the great
exaccyons and charges that they bare by cause of men of war. And to give
them leave and to send them home. And so he did / Pachomyen then seenge
himself delivered of his service. Inco^tynent came in to a town called
Smobostrum being beyond the parties of The haydes / And there in the church
in acomplysshinge the promise that he made to god Promtly he was baptized But a
merueyllous thing happed after his baptesme / For in the same night that he
was crystened. he saw in his dreme / How in to his right bond descended a
dew. the which myraculously converted in to honey / After he herd a voys
which said to him. O Pachomyen considre well this that is happed to the. For
this is the sign of ye grace that god has given to the /

Pachomyen was after enflammed with the grace of the holy ghost / And rendered
himself with the relygyouse men. for to learn the state of holy and perfyghte
life /

How saint Pachomien desirynge to be Heremyte or Relygyous / went to ye holy
fader Palemon. dwelling in deserte / And begynnyth in latin Andiuit autem /
Caplm.lviii.
AFter that Pachomyen herd say yt in deserts was an holy man named Palemon
much devout. contynuelly serving god: He went to him. and knocked at his
door / And he opened half his door / and demanded of him what he would. ^^
what he sought. Now the holy man Palemon was terryble to beholde^ By cause
that by long time living solytaryly he had ladde a strayt life and hard in
the deserte / Pachomyen ansuerde to him much humbly / Fair fader I come to
the by the commandment of my god. to the end that I ^e made and constytuted
Relygios The holy fader said to him. Thou may not be Relygyous here / It is
not a little thing to be made Relygyous But he ought well rypely to think
the holy conuersacyon in which he ought to live / For many have been in
deserts said the holy fader which have not perseueryd in their begynnynges /
Pachomyen ansuered. that the manners in all persons ben not semblable / And
therefore he prayed him / that he would receive him. And by succession of time
he should know his courage and affecyon / The holy fader said to him / My
friend I have said tofore. that here thou may not be Relygyous / And
therefore goo in to some Monastery of Relygyon / And when thou haste h^^d in
chastyte and contynence in obeyenge the rules of Religyon / Then^e shalt thou
come again to me. and gladly I shall receive the / But take heed what I shall
say to the / And way it well tofore thou proceed any ferther / And I shall
say to the what thou shalt do to get the health of thy soul / I live here
compentli enough / For my custom is to ete oonly bread and salt. I use none
oil ne wine / And I wake ordynarily till mydnyghte / And somtyne all the
night / Bisye some time in prayer. A another time in contemplacion. Or
otherwise ocupienge myself. in some helthfull work /

Pachomyen when he had all herd. Like as the dyscyples ben abashed in the
presence of their master / So he was somewhat abashed in herynge the words of
the holy man. But this notwythstondynge he trusting in the grace of god. he
purposyd all to endure / And ansuered to the holy man. Fair fader / I have
ferme affyaunce in our lord Ihesu Christ. In whom I believe fermely. That he
shall give to me strength and might to do the penau^ces that thou haste
showed to me / and that in the same by the aid of thy prayers I shall
persevere constauntly all ye time of my life /

PAlemon^ seenge the faith of Pachomyen fynably receyuyd him. And gaaf to him
the habyte of Relygyon. And dwelleden together dooynge great abstynences with
devout orysons and prayers. passing there the time of their life / Some time
they made robes of heir. not oonly for the enterteynynge of their life / But
also for to socoure the poor / When they were in prayer / And that Palemon
saw sometime Pachomyen a sleep / by cause of the labor that he tooke^ For to
eschew that he should not sleep made him for to bear sonde from one place to a
another And by the moyen of that excercyte. He being heavy of sleep. made him to
eschew the sleep. which is the nourysshment of all vices and sins. After he
admonested him that he should be always constaunt and persevering in his good
purpoos / And of all thing did the good Pachomyen his prouffyte. receyuynge
humbly and benygnely his charges. and correcco^n of the said holy man Palemon
/ By which he augmented fro day to day the perfyghte love and charity yt he
had to the mageste dyuyne /

IN the same time happened the solempnite of Ester. the which is hallowed in
great devotion and and spirytuell Joy of al good and true christian people. By
cause that in the same day many have a custom to rejoice themself sobrely.
The holy man Palemon commanded to Pachomyen that he should think of their
refecco^n for ye souper / Now as tofore is said their custom was to ete oonly
bread and salt / and to drink water. But for the reverence of the solempnyte
of the day. Pachomyen set on the fire of thise wyld coals with other herbs.
When Palemon had made his prayers. he came in to his chamber for to take his

in saying that he had made it like as he had commanded / And yt he might

Of a proud relygyous man which came for to vysite them. And begynnyth in
latin Vna vero dierum^ etc Caplm.lxi.


IT happed on a day ye a proud religyous man and superstycyous came for to
vysite them / Now had they made a fire for to warm them. For gladly denoute
persons being occupied in contemplaco^n arne sooner cold than they that done
other ocupacyons and works temporell. If they ben not kept and conserved of
god The brother being with them. saying the fire began to say / If one of
you have very faith. let him lie upon thise hot coals. and say his (Pater
noster) al a long. and I believe certainly yt he shall not brenne / Palemon
which knew his surquydrye said to him. Brother say no more such idle words
and out of reason. For it should more auaylle the to be stille. I se well well
that you art full of pride and of ^lacyon / The brother would not be correte for
any thing that Palemon said to him. but was more woollen in pride than tofore /
And without necessyte laid himself upon the hot coals / And by suffraunce of
god it happed that the devil prince and master of all proud people for more
to dysceyue him in time coming. kept him from brennynge / And after he
departed from them more fyers and proud than he had be tofore / On ye morrow
he came again to the said holy men. And again said to them in repreuynge
them by his pride saying. Habrethern where is your faith / The devil seenge
his elaco^n knew that lyghtely he should make him to fall in to what sin
that he would / And changed him in likeness of a right fair woman aourned and
arrayed worldli. and came and knocked at the door of the proud relygyous. And
he opened it And when he was within said to him O my good brother I shall tell
the wherefore I am come hither / It is troth that I am bound to many my
credytours the which for fawte of good it to me not possible to pay and
satysfye And if by adventure they fond me. I might run in to great do^mage
/ Wherefore I am come hither for to hyde me. to the end that they shall not find
me / Wherefore I pray the in good charity that thou wolte suffer me to so
iourne here a little time for to eschew this Inconvenient. And god which
has adressed me to come to the for refuge shall thank the / The relygyouse
man was much proud / wherefore god gaaf him not the grace to know that it was
the devil that spoke to him / And so received him to his dampnaco^n^ for
Incontinent the devil tempted him to the sin of lecherye. Then he lytly
suffered to be overcome / and would have enbraced the devil in likeness of a
woman / And then^e the devil threw him down to therthe / and lay there long
as he had be deed. But after certain days he came again to himself in his
good mind. and knowleged his sin. And went and told it the holy fader
Palemon / saying. A. A holy fader I am cause of my perdicyon Thou warnedest me
well. but I poor unhappy hane despised thy words. Wherefore I pray the that
thou wolte pray god for me. to the end that I may have remission of my syn^e.
Palemon and Pachomyen seenge his lamentacyon cowde not hold them fro weeping
for pity and compassion that they had of hy^ But the devil seenge that his
contryco^n was not consonaunt to his words. the which were feigned and full of
ypocresie. brought him Incontinent out of their presence / And so then the
poor miserable ran thorugh the deserts as a fool out of his wit / And
fynably came in to a cite named Panos / And there as enraged. threw himself
in to a deep cave full of hot water. In which suddenly he deyed /

PAchomyen after went bare foot thorugh the deserte. and by mountains.
Endurynge pacyently ye pryckynges and hurtes of thorns. whereof his feet were
swollen and much so^e / And he enjoyed in himself reducynge to remembrance.
how our lord had in his feet and his hondes holes per^yd by fo^e of great
naylles recourbled and blout / Which were more grievous than if they had been
sharp pryckynge All his heart and desire was for so dwell in place solytarye

And edefy^ here a monastery Many shall come to the. desirynge to prouffyte by
thy Instytucyons And thou shalt give to them the rule which I shall desyner

which was written the rule which be should te^he all them that should come to
the said place for to be relygyous under him / The which rule yet kepen the
Tabenesiens. Saint Pachomyen right affectuously all that. which thangell had
brought to him / And after came again to the holy fader Palemon / To whom he
recyted all that which was happed to him. In prayenge him that he would goo
with him to the place. where the aungel had spoken to him as said is / Palemon
which was humble and would not trowble his dyscyple / went in to the town
with hy^ / And there arrived Incontinent after the commandment of god made a
little house / In ye which long time they prayed to god deuowtely / Bysechynge
him that they might perform the church. like as ye angel had warned
Pachomien. Long time after Palemon said to Pachomyen. Now I know that the
grace of god is descended upon the. and that thou art dysposyd for to dwell
in this place where thou art / Wherefore I pray you that we make this paccyon
and couenan^t together. That during all the time of our life we be not
separate in courage ne divided / But by vysitacyon fraternall we give
consolacyon each to other The which paccyon they made and entrehelden / For

A Little time After Palemon strongly enfebled of nature by the extreme
abstinences that he made fell in a great maladye / by cause of the which well
often he ete without drink. And sometime he ete not / But his refeccyon was
either to ete or to drink oonly / Some brethern came thither for to vysite him
/ And prayyed him to enforce to take refecco^n suffisauntly for to sustain his
body / But the holy man herynge their request took oonly mete for to comfort
his members. Which were much enfeblysshed by his said abstynences. But
nevertheless that auayled no thing / For his maladye was to hy^ more grievous
wha^ he ete more thanne he was accustomye. And therefore he would not ete but
after his appetyte. and suffered pacyently his maladye. Consyderyng that many
marters had been despieced in to pyeces. Some hadd their heedes smyten of. The
other have been brent in fire. And always they perseuered unto the end for the
love of Ihesu Christ / And ye holy man said he had by their examples farye and
ample matere of pacyence. And that he ought not for a little maladye corrumpe
by gormandyse his little penaunces and fastings acustomyd / He said ferther
that they had given him more pain by the metes that he had eten in his
maladye. thanne the abstynences that he made. And so returned to his first
penance / And a month after in persevering in fastings he deyed and rendered
his soul to god But tofore his death came to hy^ saint Pachomyen. which
beheld hy^ as his fader in kissing and enbracynge hy^ As he had said to him.

AFter ye saint Palemon was by saint Pachomyen buried. the same saint Pachomyen
came again in to his monastery where god had Instytuted to him / And after
came to hy^ his brother germayn named John^. which long time had sought him
/ The holy man seenge his brother was much Joyous. for since he had be Christian
he had seen none of his fre^des. The good John^ dwelled with his brother / and if
they were bredern carnally. yet were they much more bredern spyrytuelly / They
two had but one will and one self desire. Night and day they thought on the
faith of our lord. renouncing all worldly rychesses. They wan^e their
living only with making of celles / and if they had any thing superflue of
their labor / Incontinent it was dystrybuted unto poor for thono in of god /
All their clothyng was of one vesture made of lyn^en clothe / As ye Relygiouses
were then robes / But ye holy man Pachomien ware thayre. for to keep his body
in seruytude / and whan^e sometime be slepte by night. He lay not on the
earth. but lenynge / Ferynge yt if he lay down. that he should rest over

which was thelder was wroth with hy^. by cause he made thedefice so great.
and said to hy^. My brother leave this yt thou haste begone. it is a thing
superfluous to make so large this place yt we dwell in / The holy man
Pachomyen hering thise words. ansuerd to hy^ no thing. but endured in his
courage. how well yt he was evil content with hy^. estemyng to be eniuryed by
ye words aforesaid / The night following Pachomyen descended in to a low
place yt he had begone to edefye. and fell down place in prayer wepinge and
waylyng^ by cause yt for thoccaso^n aforsayd he had be wroth against his brother
/ and in his lamentacions he said / Helas maledycco^n is happed to me. I walk
yet in obeyenge to ye flesh / Lord god have pity on me. to ye end yt I
perisshe not / and also yt by decepco^n of the devil I be not deceived Alas
lord if I be withdraw fro thy grace / and the devil find any vice in me he
shall subdue me sore in his vile seruytude. for it is written yt he that is of
any put under he is made his serfe or bond man / And yet again it is written yt
he that shall have entyerly kept and obseruyd ye law / and after in one only
sy^ne shall have offended he shall be as toward god reputed of all culpable.
and out of his health / Notwythstondyng my lord god I believe yt thy mercyes
ben so great. yt they shall help me how someuer poor and miserable sy^nar I
be / For so have been thine servants by thy sure protecco^n preserved fro ye
power of the devil. and in the end enlumyned with thy glory and felycite

Then have I hope by that. thou shalt give me knowelege of thy name That

lord god if thou give me not science and cunnyng like as thou haste promised
to me / I shall not cunne teache ne enseygne the relygyous people which thou

that I have not curyously overcome the voluptuosytee and passions of the
flesh / Ne also obseruyd and fulfyllyd thy right worthy law with vndefoylled

Wherefore I am not worthy to be ruler and governor under thy hand of so many
relygyous men. which shall come to me / And therefore my lord my Sauyoure and

in lykenes of a capon. making a cry so merueylous / That all the place
redounded / The which thing seenge the holy man / he blessed him with the
sign of the holy Cross / And bleugh against ye devil. And Incontinent he

him by lokes dyssolute. and subtle yllusyons. to excyte and moeue him to ye
dyshoneste and detestable sin of lechery But the holy man seenge tofore his
cursyd temptacyons. And for to eschew them closyd his bodily eyes. Opening

THe devil took him a another time / and beat him so much that he was

to cunne speak / But notwythstondyng that he made no mencyon by words of god.
Nevertheless his heart woke and called upon him. as he which never leuyth the
good in temptaco^ns / Then came there a religyous man named Appollo for to

it is need yt that you take in ye good courage to resist their bataylles / for
if ye devil which knows our feeble courages. in ye hope by his dysceyuable
te^ptaco^ns he might overcome the. lytly should he put us under which ben thy

he prayed the holy man Appollo that he should not depart fro him /

First it was commanded to saint Pachomyen. that he should suffer his
Relygyouses to ete and drink after them comple^yon / And that he should make
them to labor / after that they ete little or much Also he should not
defend them for to fast. And to them that should ete best he should Impose
most grettest charge / But to the feeble and wryke he should co^myse the little
charges Also the angel charged him that he should make for his Religyouses
diverse habitaco^ns In which should dwell three togider. and their mete should
be made ready in one place only. And that all together should take their
refecco^n. And yt in the night they should take and were an habyllement of
lyu^en. which should strayn their raynes. and with that they should have
skynnes of ghotes. And yt without vestymentes or clothes. they should not ete
drink ne sleep / But when they would receive the sacrament of the awter.
a^synge and say mass. they might all d^ of sauf oonly their gewne. And when
they should take their refecco^ns. that each of them should cover his head
with his gown. to the end that none of them should se a another ete / Also
that none of them should speak while they ete. By cause they should not torn
their mind on other part. And ferthermore that they sing or say every day
in the morning twelve Orysons. and as much at even. and in like wise at
mydnyghte twelve / And how well ye Pachomyen said to the angel that it was
well lityll if they said not moo prayers. nevertheless the angel said to him
that he would not command them any more. To the end that they that should be
feeble and little devout might lightly do it without exculaco^n of their
feebleness. But they yt were mighty and strong were not to be excusid by this
law in manner. but yt they were ^ou^de to say more When tha^gel had der^^red
all this aforsayd. suddenly he vanysshed away fro hy^. and the holy man which
fond hy^self certain of ye said visyon ye which he had seen three times
rendered graces to god / And after he enduced his relygiouse monks to live
after ye ^hangell had showed unto him / and with yt he gaaf unto them many
other doctrynes And emonge all other he said to them. yt since they were
religyouse it were necessary to them to leave ye world. their parents. and
also the^self. to the end yt they might lightly bear ye cross and follow their
good master our savior and redemer

Iha^ criste / And by his good words and ensamples all the relygyous bare
before them the frnytes of holy penance For how well that he was right old /
Yet for that absteyned he not to do. and notwythstondynge he did many
abstynences. and more than any of the other / Yet he took upon him ye business
and charge of all the other in serving them after his power / At the hour
when they ought to ete he covered ye tables. and served them like as ye
custom was in their relygyon / In like wise he labored the gardins. sewe the
seeds for cabochis and colewortes / and watered them / And if any knocked at
the door of the church. he was ye first ready to open it / He served them yt
were seek. and admynystred to them their necessytees / In doing these things
he gaaf ensample of humylyte to all his dyscyples / and occasyon to serve not
oonly to their auncyents and elders. but also to them that came after them to
the Relygyon / Also he admonested to excercyse them after their vocacyon and
calling / And commanded them to make contynuelly pray^es. and estudye hesyly
in especyall in ye holy gospelles / to the end that thereby they might acustome
them gladly in the commandments of god And to love him above all things
hertely. And pain them for to acomplysshe them in getynge of virtues for
fynably to obtain the Joy and felycyte eternal /

IT happed that three men / that one named Postentesus. that other Surys. and
the third Oblys came for to vysyte the holy heremyte Pachomyen. the which by
his words and by ensamples of holy life moved them to do penance / And when
they had contempled his bountee. that one of them said to the other /
Certainly we know now that they err openly. that say that the chyldern
ensiew and follow the manners of their faders and moders / and say not well /
For oftymes of evil fader and evil mother descend right good children: as it
aperyth by this holy man Pachomyen. which is so Just. that in his life he
never brake any of the co^mau^dements of god / And nevertheless he is extracte
and descended of the lignage of Paynyms and ydolatours all contrary to ye law
of god / And against them that have folysshe ymaginaco^ns. saying that they
have good to do. well or evil / For if they ought to be sauyd. they shall be
sauyd / And if they ought to be dampened they shall so be / These ben fools and
enraged / For we find in holy scripture. our blessed savior to have said /
Come to me ye that been charged with many euylles. and I shall dyscharge you /
And in this saying. he excepted not one /

Also he woll not the death of a sinner / And therefore every one ought to
persevere in his goodness to his lives end / These three men came again
afterward to the holy man. prayeng hy^ that he would tell them the cause
wherefor he took that pain upon him to serve all his religyouses / Whereat he
answerde. saying to them in this wise / When men woll learn a mare or some
other be for to bear a great burden. they give her first a little charge
And after by contynuance men increase her burden / For who should first give
her almoche as she might bear. she happily would not endure with it. but should be
rebel / All thus must I do to my bredern. which god has give me to keep in
a good rule / First I give them a little charge. And after by example I show
to them how they ought to do. when they have seen the burden that I have
borne now / I have be long ^^fore them in this monastery / And they ben come
them but a while agoon / Wherefore I ought to bear a more charge than they
done now /

Afterward by the grace of god that benygnly callyth every one to do penance
/ came many deuowte persons to the holy man. for to live solytaryly with him /
Among which came Pawle / a another Pachomyen. and one named Johan. the which
lived there a holy life and honest without any spotte of sin / After this he
stablysshed some for to have the governance and rule of the monastery / And
pryncypally the most virtuous and humble above the other / And said the holy
man. that like as a sp^^cle of fire that fallith among an keep of sheuys of
corn may not be but with great paynt que^chyd. And often times it is seen that
it brennyth all the hoo^e hepe / In like wise if in a relygyon be some
Relygyouses that change there thoughts to that cursyd vice of ambycyon /
Desiring to be first and princypall in the Order / And to have there great
offices / If from their heart thus enflammed they putt not away soon the
bronde of this evil suggestion rihtlyghtly / They lose Incontynente that they
have sought by long time before And for this cause the holy man would not
consent nor suffer that the one should have any lordshyp or premynence over
the other / And namly upon a solemn. feeste / And to the end that this
Inordinate affection were take fro them. and will to precede that one the
other / He made a priest to come that was not of that monasterye. for to do
there the office and service. that should admynystre them the sacraments /
And more over he said. that it is better to live in charity and in humylyte.
than in dysordynate worshypp / And if some clerk or priest came to him for to
be Relygyous. He made to him honor after his astate / and like as it
aperteyneth to a man of the church /

THe humylyte of the holy fader Pachomyen was so great. that all the servants
of god he honored and louyd To the old to the seek. and to the little he did
all ghostely and bodyly seruyses / Counseyllynge and comfortynge them for the
salvation of their souls / And so he seenge that the nombre of his
Relygyouses encreaced / he made and constytued some of them his Coadiutours
and helpers / And other he ordained as Pryours for to help him to save their
souls / And techynge them the Rules to him given by the angel He constrained
them all to be very obedyent: and to have the dread of god in their hertes And
when he that had the governance and charge of the works of the monastery was
fayllynge in any thing / The good holy fader Pachomyen took the charge upon
him / And amended the fawte. as servant of all the other. Not for to seem meke
by vaynglory / But by very affection and good love /

Of the charytee of saint Pachomyen / To the chapter which begyn^yth Quodam

Saint Pachomyen was much pytefull. and charytable / He seenge that in the
places being night to his monastery were many folk that ocupyed them in none
other wise but to keep the beestes / without coming to church / And without

Cen^^ryens / And gaaf him counseyle that he should do build a church in the
same place / where as thyes Pastors or Shepherdes dwelled / to the end that
they should be for this cause more inclined. and deuowte to pray god / And to
receive there their ryghtes and sacraments of the church / And thus made the
bysshopp to be done / But by cause that there were no clerks not yet. that
did the service of the church / He and some of his Relygyouses came to vysyte
them / And showed them some hystoryes of the holy scripture / And by this he
excyted and mouyd the good persons to devotion So that by his doctrine many
were converted to the faith. And his charity was spradde as well upon the
mysbyleuyd people. as upon the Christian folk / For when he saw any men or
wymmen that were Heretykes. or out of the true believe. He wept / Prayenge god
for them that he would torn them /

THe same time Achanase that perfight was and replenisshed of all virtues. was
bishop of Alexandrye / The which as he vysyted the chyrches / prechynge the
Christian faith / Came to the place where saint Pachomyen was / Which knowing
of his coming acompanyed of all his religiouses / Came with great gladness
against the said Achanase. singing Ympnes and orysons / And was received of
him and of his Relygyouses right gladly / But the good holy fader Pachomyen
showed not himself to him / But bydde him among his Relygyouses / By cause
that the bysshopp of the Centiryens. of whom i^ spoken above had said much
good of him unto saint Athanase. which had be strongly persecuted of the
Heretykes Arryens / And by cause the said holy man Pachomyen was very deuowte
and a good Christian man. Also that he knew well the persecucyons that the said
Athanase hadd suffered by the Arryens This Pachomyen which with all his might
bare and mayntened the true Christian folk / Approuyd strongly the condycyons
and holy living of saint Athanase / And hertly leuyd him / And had the
obstynate Heretykes in fore great Indygnacyon / And pryncypally Orygenes. that
was chaced out of the church by Eraclius bysshopp of Alexandrye / Orygenes by
his false doctrine hadd given many vntrueful techynges contrary to the holy
scripture / For like as they that woll give poison to drink. putt honey among
it for to have away the evil taast. and the bytternesse thereof from the tongue
/ to the end that it may be drunk more lightly / So did the said Orygenes.
the which said and brought forth fair and honest proposicyons But he
corrupted them by false exposycyons. that was cause of the loss of much
Christian people / Wherefore the holy man Pachomyen deffended. not only to his
Relygyouses that they should not read in none of this Orygenes books / But also
he would that if some other did read them. they should not here them by no
means. What someuer sentence it were /

One time among his books he found of the said Orygenes volumes / Which
Incontinent he did cast in to a water saying / If it were not by cause that
the name of god is wrytt in the books of Orygenes. I should bren^e them all /
By this apperyth the charity which he hadd to the holy believe and faith of
Crystendom / Whan^e some Religyous blamyd his felawe. he would not here him /
But fled from him as much as he cowde / Considering the word of the
Psalmyste saying / I shall persecute him that shall bakbyte his even christian /
And he said that a good person should never speak none evil word And to this
purpoos he alleged many historyes. Princypally of one Machayre. which in
blaming Moses was Incontynente punysshed by the hand of god /

/ that he was hoole and sound / But he would not see her with his bodily eyes
/ And more over that if she would forsake the world. and serve god / He should
do build a house for to lodge her. where she should do penance / And that he

other wymmen should yield theymselfe to serve god with her / And she heringe
these words from her brother. She was replenysshed at heart with so great
compunccyon and such contrycyon that she promised to serve god all her life /
Wherefore the holy man seenge that she was all ready turned. gave graces and
tha^kynges to our lord And after he commanded his brethern that they should
make her a chapel far enough from his monastery / So it happed soon after
by the grace of god that from al prouynces and countrees came wymmen that
yielded theymself to Religyon with the said sister of saint Pachomyen The which
he admonested to resyste always against the fleshly temptacyons And in like
wise after the cunning that god had give hy^ He foreyd him to excyte them to
virtues and good manners / Prayenge god that it would playse him to preserve
them in his grace / More over he gaaf to them such and like rules as his
Relygyouses did keep / Sauf that they should not were no gretes fellis / And
if any Relygyous had a sister. or some other kynne. which she would vysyte /
She should not goo there. but that she took with her one of the eldeste of the
Relygyon / And they ought not to speak together / but in the presence of ye
Abbess. or else of some of theldest Relygyouses / Nor she should not bear ne
give no thing out of their howses For the Religyouses as well the men as the
wymmen ought not fro that time to have no thing of their own And if by
adventure they should of necessytee make some reparaco^ns. they chose the most

To the chapter which begynnyth in latin Her talis / Caplm lxxx.
THorugh all the country and abowte it. the conuersacyon of saint Pachomyen
was so re^o^rned. that many act the example of him forsook the world. for to
live a relygyous life / And among the other a young child named Theodore.

folk and of the aege of xiiii. year or there abowte / From the which aege
upon a Twellyfth day. that some Egepcyens made great feast and great diners.
The good Theodore seenge the house of his fader and mother full of goods /
said by great conpunccyon of heart in himself / What prouffytyth the unhappy
if he getyth all the goods of this world. and he lesyth the Joy of paradyse
/ None with great pain ye woll use at his pleysure of the good of this
world. can not get the heavenly glory This thinking in his heart he began
to weep and syghe. Saying to our blessed Savior Ihesu Christ / O god almighty
thou know all things secret / Thou know that I love not so much
worldly thing as thyselfe / I pray the my god that it playse the to kyndle my
poor simple soul. so that she that is maculate with sin be not dampened /
But she which was boughte with thy bitter passion he attendaunte and ready in all her works to worshypp and love the perpetuelly / And during the time that
he was in his oryson^ and that he wep^e in this wise. came his mother to him

How Theodore was received of saint Pachomyen / To the chapter beginning in

IT happed one day among other. that the brethern and relygyouses of ye
monastery where as was Theodore / after deuowte orysons dysputed of the old
Testamente of the Ark of Noah. of the rod of Aaron / And of the tables that
were given to Moses in the mountain of Synay. where the body of saint
Katheryne lies / And then^e one of the same Relygyouses said. that many times
he had berde speak of it well alonge to the holy man Pachomyen / And with this
they rehercyd of him. and of his holy living merueyllouse things Theodore
heringe this that they said of hy^ thise Relygyouses Prayed to god in his
heart. and said My god if it be true that my brethern say of saint Pachomyen.
give me grace that I may see him / To the end that I may keep all thy
commandments and afterward to be sauyd / As thou haste promised to them
that shall love and dread the / Certain days after came to the said monastery
a man named Pecusus that came for to inquire of the good behauynge and devotion
of the said Relygyouses / And by cause that Theodore was enfourmyd that he went
to the monastery of ye holy man Pachomyen / He prayed him be sily to take him
in his company / This Pecusius seenge his affecco^n entreated him mekely. and
brought him unto ye said monastery of saint Pachomyen / Then this Theodore
coming night the said monastery. thanked god of that it had playsed him to
here his prayer so redyly / For he desired no thing so much as to see saint
Pachomyen / And as they were come to the gate he and his fellow / there fond
him there / So began Theodore to weep sore in the presence of the holy man
Pachomyen. of the great Joy that he had to see him / The holy man said to him
My sone. thou art well simple to weep so / For I am a synnar as thyselfe / How
well that god has take me in to his service / And in saying this he brought
him within his monastery / And when he saw the great multitude of religyouses
that were there / his heart was enflammed and take of a love so perfyghtly /
that he was as in a Ialousye to use his life in that place /

He was dyscrete and prudent in his words and works plenteuous in humylyte in
compucco^n of heart and in operaco^ns virtues. as in fastinges. watchy^ges. and
orysons in which he spend his time contynuelly. And with this he comforted
the sory^ and the synnars by humbly correcco^n friendly he admonested and warned
/

How Theodore refusyd to see his mother / And begynnyth in latin Deuique tam
preclaram / Caplm lxxxii.


Saint Pachomyen when he saw the holy Conuersacyon of Theodore. he louyd him
with all his heart. The mother of this Theodore having knowledge that he was
with the said saint Pachomyen cam^ anon there for to see him beryng with her
lettres fro many bishops / By the which they wrote well pressyly yt her sone
should be delyuerde to her again So came she first to the monastery of the
wym^en / that was nigh ynouh the monastery of saint Pachomyen / and by cause
that the wymmen went never to his monastery / She wrote unto him that he should
send her her sone again / And with this she sent him the lettres that the
bishops wrote unto him that they should do so / The holy man seenge the
said lettres. sent for Theodore / To whom he exposyd the tenor of the same /
And commanded him to goo his way as well for to please his mother. as for to
obey the bysshoppes commandment / Theodore answerde unto saint Pachomyen /
Ha my fader I demand the if now I leave the astate of Religyon. which is so
much fruytfull / And without which with great pain any can not be sauyd /
Shall I not be thereof repreued at the day of dome before god / We have in the
gospel / that who some ever shall love his fader or mother more than god / He
shall not be worthy to be made his servant / Saint Pachomien answered / My
sone. if thou seem that thou do against thy conscience to speak with thy
mother / I woll well that thou abide here / But also if thou be otherwise
dysposyd / I will not keep the by force. The rule of the very Relygyouses is
for to forsake all together the world. and to flee all worldly conuersacyons /
And therefore he that would say my fader and my mother arn my blood I ought to
love them / He must take heed to saint Poul yt says / Whoso^euer yt shall be
ouercom by ye flesh. he shall be servant to the flesh / And in effect
every body becomyth thrall unto him of whom he letyth himself to be brought
under foot / His mother seenge yt she might not speak with hy^ purposed to
dwell with ye virgynes that had their place nyghe the said monastery where her
sone was a Relygouse. Hoping by goddis grace that she should see him among
the other Relygyouses / And also that in this dooynge she should purchase some
mede to the salvation of her soul / during the time that she were in the
monastery with ye said vyrgynes / And by this that is said apperyth openly /
that to keep some time Rygoure in the worshypp of Ihesu Christ and not for no
praysyng ne vaynglory. is often cause of great goods to them against the
which men ben Rigorouse. How be it that for a short space of time it semyth
them that men have offended them /

Of many reprouyd Relygyouses / To the chapter beginning in latin Igitur
sicut / Caplm lxxxiii.


AAfter that we have seen of the manners and virtues of many virtuous and holy
Freres. consequently we shall see the necligence of some reprouyd Relygyouses
that folowen after their flesshely appetyte out of al good rule / The which
gaaf great malencolyes to saint Pachomyen / By cause that for no manner of
monycyon ne warnynges that he made to them. they would not return them /
Whereby the holy man was wonderfully sorrowful and heavy / And complaining him to
god. he said / O my god that haste lordshypp over all the world / Thou
commaundest us to love our even christian / And therefore my god that know my
will and the secret of my conscience / I pray ye that thou wolt not dispyse
my oryson. The which often I have made unto the for these wretchydfull
Relygyouses. to the end that thou have of them pity and mercy. in gyuynge to
them thy dread reverently / And grace to know thy dyuyne puyssaunce. for to
obey and serve the / Having in the only without any other the steadfast hope
of their saluaco^n / Truly my soul is feblyd and tourmented so much. and
all my w^ttes trowblyd. of their abhomynable living and Innyquyte / The holy
man seenge they would not amend them / He made yet again prayers unto god for
them / And after gaaf to them certain small and easy rules. to learn them to
honor and pray god / To the entente that little and little they might
accustom them to do well / And amend their life / Ferdermore seenge that
they could not acco^plisshe their delectacyons and playsures wythstondynge the
contynuell denyenge of saint Pachomyen / That suffered them never goo out of
the monastery. for to playse their wicked wylles / They for look the monastery.
and ensyewed the devil their lord and master /

And after that the other Relgyouses were more desirous in ye love of god
thanne before / For thus as the corn when it is weded from the evil herbs
grows and multyplyeth the better / In like wise when in a felyshypp of
folk peasyble are some vycyouse men / It is of necessyte to throw them out
from the other / And by this it is seen that to a man given to the world.
auayllyth him not to be a Relygyous / For his professyon shall do him no
prouffyte. if he be neclygente to keep the Rules of his Relygyon / In like wise
a prayer prouffyteth not that is made for them that been aslepe in their sins
if they help not to awake theymself /

How Relygyouses of other monasteryes coming to vysyte the monastery of saint
Pachomien were not received in to the said place among the dwellers / And
begynnyth in latin Confessor etc. Caplm lxxxiiii
THere was a priest named Denis. that was Confessor Prouysor and

man defferred and putt of for to gadre within his monasterye with his brethern.
the Relygyouses that camen to him from other monasterys / But made their
necessytees to be admynystred to them by theymselfe. and without the gates of
his monastery / Reproved him sharply in saying to him / That he did not well
to do so / The holy man took and resceyued benygnely his correcyon / And
answered to him My brother and friend. god knowyth my will. and mine entencyon /
And also he knowyth well how I desire the salvation of all souls / And none I
would despise ne provoke to wrath / I know also that god has said in his
gospel / That this that men shall do to the leest of his servants / He
shall take it in like wise as it were done to himself / And therefore wit it.
that I do not so for to contempne them ne despise them / But oonly by cause
that I know some Relygyouses in my church so simple yt they should not conne
put dyfference between their right hand and lift hand / And yet some other
there ben also that bear not the habyte of relygyon / Wherefore me semyth good
and nedeful that they that been coming to us from other places be received
honestly in a another house by ours / And wha^ they woll come to the church to
serve god. they may come there with us /

And after the service dyuyne done. to return in to their lodges / for to do
there their secret Oracyons or other virtuous works after their devotion The
priest hering his answer was content of him / And went again away. all
recomforted and with good counseylle /

IN the cite of the Centiryens a woman had hadd and suffered by a long space a
syckenesse called the blody Flux / So came she to ye good priest above named /
And by cause he was famylier friend of saint Pachomyen^ Prayed him humbly that
it would playse him to send for the holy man Pachomyen that was in his
chamber. saying that he had certain necessary things to tell him / Saint
Pachomyen came to the sendynge of ye said priest / And when he was com^ with in
the church. he made his prayer and after he salued the good priest Denis / and
as they spoke together. the poor woman having a steadfast believe in god ye
says in the gospel / Have co^fydence and thy faith shall save the. took fro
behind of the vestyment yt the holy fader had upon his heed. and touched it
with great dread / whereof it happed merueilousli yt she was anon heelyd hoole

thanked god of th^^ yt he made so great miracles by his servants yt have to

How saint Pachomyen by his de^^nay^te was cause of the good life of a
Relygyous / And it begynnyth in latin Aliquando vero et cetera Caplm lxxxv.


Certain days after a Relygiouse that would be a priest. was brought to saint
Pachomien by one his friend / that was mynystre at abbot of many Relygiouses /
And the which mynystre or abbot was often vexed by the same Relygyouse / For by
cause he would not conferme ne grant the clerkely sheerynge / The which
then he defferred long / by cause it semyd him not the said Relygyouse to be
able ne suffysaunte for to be promoted there unto / Fynably by cause he cowde
no longer resyste to his Importunyte / Brought him to saint Pachomyen /
trusting that he should well content him / Saint Pachomyen when he had
understand the entenco^n of the said Abbot He said to him My brother thou art
come to me for as know the will of god / I counseyle she that thou give to him
that yt he askyth / And by adventure thus dooynge his soul shall be delyuerd
fro the thraldom of the devil For some time the wicked so constytued in
office or benefyte turn theymselfe and take good manners / And therefore the
will of god is. that we shall have pity the one of that other / The answer
well understand / the said Abbot confermyd and gaaf him that yt he asked.
After that the said Religyous was constytued to a clerk. he began all
together to bow to all good condycyons / And afterward he came again to the
holy man Pachomyen / and knelynge down before him said / O man of god I know
that thou art much agreeable to god / when he does grant the power for to
dyscerne and know of the salvation of men / Thy bounte has vaynquysshed my
malice / For if thou had not be pytuouse and sweet I should have left the
habyte of Relygyon. and should have gone again to the world to fynysshe my
days wretchydly / Whereof blessed be thou of god / by the which thou haste
given salvation to my soul / The holy fader took him up from the earth and
said to him / My brother I pray the that thou continue always in works
behouynge and apperteynyng to thy dygnytee / And so kyssed him / And commended
him to god /

How saint Pachomyen delivered a woman soore traueylled of the devil And

Saint Pachomyen being yet in the said place. came a man to him that prayed
him swetely that he would have pity of his daughter / the which was vexed and
traueylled with the devil / The holy man entered within his monastery. and left
this man at the gate / And after he sent him word by the Porter. that he not
his Relygyous were not wont to vysyte any wymmen / And if he had any of her
Rayments that he should send it to him / And it should be hallowed and blessed /
And after in putting the same upon her / if he had in god faithful believe and
hope / His daughter by the grace of god might be delivered of the send. and
brought to good recouerynge of health / The fader brought the gown of his
said daughter And when the holy man saw it / He said to him that it was not
hers /

The fader answered. and said it was Then said the good holy fader to him /
By cause I know that she keep not her chastyte / Therefore I said. that it was
not her gown / For she ought to live chastely / So must she promise to live
in contynence / And after god shall help her / The fader questyoned his
daughter / And she answerde that the words of the holy man were true / But
notwythstondynge she promised. that she should never return to her sin /
Then took saint Pachomyen an oil and blessed it. And gave it to her fader /
And after that she was enoynted with the same oil. she was hoole and sound /
And so she lived afterward holyly in great chastytee and contynence /

AFter this a another man that had his sone seek. having the devil in his body.

me^^ the holy man that he would pray goo for his sone. and he did so / And
(...) he sent him a little of hallowed bread And commanded that men should
give it him to ete before all other mete

The Spyryte dampened that was within the body of the forsayde child. would not

And after he gaaf to him of the said breed / And then for great hungre he ete

of the passion of the devil / So came he and yielded graces and tha^kynges to
the holy man Pachomyen. in gloryfyenge the name of god. that does so many
miracles by his servants /

Always the holy man for no miracle that he did in the name of god / never
gloryfyed himself for it And whereof he is more to be praised / When he made
some request to god. notwithstondynge it were not granted to him Men should
never have known in hy^ any sign of sorrow or dysplaysure / But said by his
great meekness. that god would not grant him that which he axed / By cause
that his askyng might be contrary to his salvation / ne to the saluaco^n of

Of the Conversion of saint Syluayn / And begynnyth in latin Taliter igitur et
cetera / Caplm lxxxviii.


Saint Syluayn wyllyng to torn him out of the fylth of sin for take clean
pouertee / Came and yielded himself to saint Pachomyen / which friendly
received him But this notwythstondynge he would not keep the Rules of the
Relygyouses For it was over hard a thing to him for to forgete his evil
customs / of the time passed / By the which he perverted many brethern / And
bowed them to his wicked will. Some Religyouses were right sorry of that they
saw the other Relygyouses consenting to the detestable will of Syluayn / So
came they and showed it to the holy fader Pachomien^ yt which prayed god for
the said syluayn. to the end he should have contryco^n for his sin: and that
he should do penance But for no prayer he would not plyene consent thereto /
And for this cause they all would have chaced him out of the monastery / The
holy fader defferred it and ladd him with him / And syn after corrected him
with sweet words techyng him always in the christian faith / Whereof it happed
syn that the poor Syluayn / as by synguler grace amended his wicked life. and
had it in so great dysplaysure. yt he was never without teeres in all his
works / Some seenge his great contryco^n. showed unto him that he angered
himself to bytterly. and exorted him to be moderate in his wepynges. taking in
him attemperaunce / but he answerde that he cowde not / For his heart was so
sore taken with great dysplaysure / that he might not conteyne himself / And
morouer by cause he cowde not absteyne hy^self fro weeping / as well at the
board as else where / The bredern said to him yt he should weep in making his
holy orysons. and not at the table / For it was no place p^op^e ne couenable
to weep ne weyle / And that a relygyous might well have sorrow and dysplaysure
for his syn^e by himself alone. without to show it thus openly / And
admonested him to abstene himself thereof / by cause the brethern might not
ete. when they saw him weep so / Such and semblable words they said to him.
for to constreyne him to tell the cause. for which he continued so long in
his weyllynges and lamentacions / And then he said to them / My brethern.
why should not I weep in Ioyenge myself of the grace that my god has done to
me / I was wont to be full of sins. and so many benefaytes are now given
unto me for the saluaco^n of my soul / Dathan and A^yron ben contynuelly in my
remembrance / To the confusyon of the which. by cause they were defoyled and
poluted with sin And would have towched the holy sacrefyce. The earth opened
and swalowed them in / And I that have despised so much my salvation. I fere
yet right soore such a sentence of god / Alas though I should weep and weylle
mine Innyquyte al my life days. and that I were in contynuell lamentacyons /
Yet should I be unworthy to have the felycyte eternal / The good ^yluayn
continued in his humylytee and contynence so that he was more perfect than all
the other / And saint Pachomyen seenge his holy conuersacyon said in the
presence of all the other such words. My brethern I call god to witness.

it him / Nevertheless when he saw that Theodore can streyned him so sore / He
said to him If I crowed that he should ar^yse himself in vaynglory therefore. I
should never declare it to him / but by cause I know that the virtue praised.

and brought him under your fete / Nevertheless Syluayn young of aege. yt thy
bredern and thyselfe would put out of our monastery. has fought in such
wise against him. that he has this gift of god. that ye devil dare never show
himself before his face / And by his great humylytee he has overcome him in all
things / Ye other have confydence in your virtues / But he. the more yt he
batayllyth. he yeldyth himself the more meke and unprofitable / And if you
demand why he wept so contynuelly / I tell the that it is by cause he is
perfyghtly meke / And for this cause he can not forbere his teeres / So wite

there some Religyouses that were of good life and of co^uersaco^n good / In

And as he was come nigh a monastery. which he vysited by the way. he met with
many Relygyouses yt conveyed the corpse of one of their bredern that was

be borne to the grave without any singing of any psalmodye / The relygiouses
and also the friends of the deed seeng his commandment to be contrary to

prayed hy^ that he would suffer the said relygiouses to say the orysons and
psalmodies in such caas acustomed / To ye which petico^n the holy man would
not consent / Whereof the friends seenge his will blamyd him asking him whereof
ye folly came / The^ after said the relygiouses / What is that man but he ought

that it were to us a great repreyf if we did this yt he says / Would god that
we hadd never come here / and that Pachomyen had never be relygyous we should
not have had such a shame. so said they to him again We pray the fair fader yt
it woll playse the to consent ye men sing over this corpse as it is of custom

visible / and I consydre thynuysible / ye worship yt ye would do to hy^ should
sooner be to hy^ more cause of torme^te and labor than other help or rest /
and thyniurye yt ye say I woll do to him shall be cause of his sauaco^n /
Wherefore I wol not procure ne assent yt men make honor to ye body yt is all
ready deed. but to his soul which is Inmortall. God yt is fo^tayne of al
sapye^ce / says in his gospel. Who soever shall syn^e against the holy ghost^ he
shall never have remyssion in this world nor in the other / By this is give us
to understand yt there be some sins. of ye which men have pardon after ye
death through ye prayers of other / and therefore I pray you yt ye do as I have
told you / For god is almighty to take hy^ in to the felycyte eternal at our
prayers and without his presence / And thus they made hy^ to be buried in a

paradyce / Then Zachius answered / Alas my fader pardonne me. and pray god
for my wretchydnesse. to the end that it ^oll pleyse him for to pardo^ne me my
sin / And from that hour he took such a dysplaysure of the sin yt he
thought to have done in using of the said oil. that he continued in
lamentac^^^ and wepynges a hoole year / and with this he fastyd two year / And
in fasting he took a small refeccion / The holy fader Pachomien knowing his

none has there so great power as I have / Then after she vanysshed a way
from his syghte / Then the holy man Johan supposyd after his aduys. that it
was compassyon or alms that was appeared before him in likeness of a woman /
By cause she hadd on her heed a fair crown of lawrer / For certainly the
great compassyon and benygnytee that god has to the poor sinners / He has
made his right dear and sweet child Ihesu Christ to take our kind flesh /
and suffer so many euylles for us / The holy man after this vysyon aroos /
without to a wake any body. and went to the church / And ingoynge thither he

And by cause him semyd that he had be over hasty and ready to receive the said
penyes. doubting to be dysceyued / He went to have delivered them again to

Of a Rich man that was fallen in great pouertee / And begynnyth in latin
Descendente sanctissimo. etc. Caplm.C.xv.
THe holy Patryarke John^ the Almoner. on a Sunday gooynge to the church came
before him a poor man. that some time hadd be rich / And had had much
good / But he had be robbyd of thieves that had left him no thing / whereof
he might mayntene his poor life So was he constrained to beg his bread for
goddis sake / And asked of the said saint Johan the Almoner his alms / The
which having compassyon of his wretchyd fall / And by cause he had sometime
noble fader and mother. ordained that his Almoner should give him the sum of
fyftene pound of gold / But the said Almoner complaynyng the great almesses
that the said saint Johan made was much dysplaysed and aggreuyd of that he
must void out of his hondes. and take to this poor man so great a sum of
money / And for this cause he went Incontinent to speak with the Stiewarde.
that was wont to give accountes of all the money that each day were spente
and allowed for the necessaryes of the said saint Johan / And to whom each one
made his acountes / and yielded his Reckoning of the money that was taken by
his hondes for to be tornyd to the said deeds and necessaryes / They two
together speaking and comynynge of this foresaid matere. by the temptaco^n of the
cursyd spyryte Mammona ye tempted them of the brennynge and Insacyable sin
of couetyse. purposid and concluded that of ye said xv.li. of gold. should be
taken out x.li. and but v.li. given to the said poor man. the which thing was
so done / Now it is troth that their lord saint Johan the Almoner was sore
famyd and reno^med ye he gladly did great alms / Wherefore many notable
lords and other persons. desirynge to playse him / and somewhat to content his
sauourous appetyte. and ye deuoco^n that he hadd to recomfort the poor
servants of god / They gaaf and send often times to him great som^es of money
for to give for goddis sake. as well for the health of the souls of some deed.
as for the prosperitee of them that were on live / And thus a rich and notable
wydowe. that had a child and no more^ came toward the said holy man / The
which wydowe for some pytenous consyderaco^us her monyge purposyd for to do
certain a^messes by the said holy manes hand / And for to do this she took
hy^ a little writing that she had written with her own hand / By the which
she let him understand that she would have dealed to poor folk the som^e
of.v.C^ li. And in receyuynge and opening of ye said writing by the said holy
man He knew by the will of god. that she had be willing for to do her said
alms unto the som^e of xv. hundred pode / So did be call the said wydowe
/ And in the presence of his said Almoner and Styewarde / which in like wise
by the showing of god / he knew to have wythholde to their behouffe ten
pound of the fyftene pound that he before had ordeynyd to be give to the poor
man that had he robbed / He charged the same wydowe that she should tell him
truth / Which she promised him to do so / Now herke said he my friend. by
the faith that thou owe to god. Haste not thou had late a will to make a
gretter alms than of five hundred pound. She answerde Ye / And that she
herself had written the writynge that she had delyuerde unto him / And she was
well certain that by ye said writing she had declared that her will was to
give fyttene hundred pound for goddis sake to poor people / But by cause that
sone after as she would have take the said writing. she had seen as she lokyd
in ^^. that where she had written that her will was to give an alms of
fyftene hundred pound to the poor people she found but five hundred pound
oonly in nombre / And for this cause she had restrained her first will / And
had purposyd and thought that she should give oonly the said five hundred
pound / Supposing by the retornynge and change of the said writing. the
will of god to be / That she should not give but this five hundred pound / And
that she should keep the remenaunt for her sone / These words so spoken And
after that she had delivered to saint Johan the said five hundred pound / And
was gone from him / He said to his said Stiewarde and Almoner / I pray to god
that he call you and ask you ones acompte of a thousand pound yt this wydowe
has with hold. as ye be bound to give hem again For and if he had taken to
the poor man the xv.li. that I hadd ordained for him / And whereof ye have
wythholde.x.li. our lord should have suffered. that this wydowe should have given
to the poor people the same thousand pound that she has wythholde in her
hand. Then the said Almoner and Styewarde knowing their misdeeds prosternyd
or ^aste theymself at his fete and required him mercy and amendment. and they
should never do such a another offense /

Of Niceta Patrice and ruler of the common w^ele in Alexandrye / Beginning in
latin Intuens niceta et cetera Caplm.C.xvi.


IN Alexandrye was a Provost or ruler of the cite. named Nyceta. fulfilled of
the devil. the which came to argue and repreue the holy Patryarke saint Johan
/ Saying to him / Sire ye waste all the land. For ye deal to freely the
silver that is brought to you / Better it were that ye should putt it to the
common tresour / The holy man without to anger himself answerde to him / Haa my
lord it is not leyffull. that the goods given to the god in heaven. be turned
or appropred to the erthely things / But and if semith the to be do / Goo
thou under my bed. and take the tresoure of Ihesu Christ that is there / So
do thereof thy will / Then this Patrice that hadd the rule and governance of
the common we will in Alexandrye. made all to be laden / And left him no more
than to the nombre of an hundred penyes of gold / And as he was coming down
from the said Patryarkes chamber / He met with men of Affryque. the which
bare certain bot tells full of gold / Upon some of the which was written /
Honey right good And upon the other / Honey without smoke / The said Patryce or
Ruler when he saw thise superscrypco^ns sent word to the said holy man that
he should send him some honne / And he that was so much humble and meke.
sent him the bottell. upon which was written Honee right good with a letter
wherein was written this that fofolowyth. Our lord that has said I shall not
leave the. Is without lesynge / And he is very god. the which gives both mete
and life / And no man corruptyble can not by any wise constrayne him / And
therefore to god I commend the / And after he commanded to them that bare the
said battelles^ that they should make them to be opened before them / And that
they should say that all the other that they had seen were full of silver /
The which thing done / When the said Patrice saw that he sent him but
one bottell alone / he was sore we oath against him / And after he radde his
lettre. And whan^e he saw that word. That man corruptyble can not
constrayne god / He was full sorry and dysplaysaunt of that he hadd done / And
Incontinent came again to the holy Patryarke / And took him again all that
he had had of him And with this he gaaf him of his own three hundred penies
of gold / Requyryng him by great contrycyon that he would give him penance
for his sins / Then the holy man was sore merueyllyd of his conuersyon so
suddenly sore / And seenge his repentance comforted him with merry words / And
from that time there were so great friends together. that the said Nicera
Patrice of Alexandrye made him his Godsypp /

GOd that tempted Abraham for to know his obeyssaunce / Towchynge the offrynge

It is rehercyd here above. how the Assiryens that had be sore oppressyd of the
Percyens For to eschew their woodnesse. forsook and left their own land /
And many of them came to Alexandrie for to be socoured in their pouertee by
the holy Patryarke Johan / They being in Alexandrye. happed there a great
derthe and scarcitee of corn. thorugh the occasyon of the flode of the river
of Nyle that bedewyth and watreth the land had be so mynysshyd and lessed of
water. that it might not give his moyst^es and over flowe^ges acustomyd to the
earth. So had act that time the Patriarch given for goddis sake to the poor
people all his tresour. and wyste not where to borow more another gold nor
silver / Whereof he was right sorry. and namely by cause he might nor continue
his alms / as he had of custom / He set hy^self to pray. and continued in
his orysons long time In the said cite was a man bygame / that is to wit. the
which by cause he knew yt the holy man was in great necessytee. would
constrayne hy^ to make hy^ a deaken in his church / And by cause he should not
have durst speak to him thereof. he sent him a letter. by ye which he besoughte
him that he would make him deaken in his church / to the end that in serving
god with hy^ he might have remysso^n of his sins. and he should give him.ii.
C.M. Rasers of whete. with a.C. and four score pound of money / His lettres
seen. the Patryarke sent for him and after made to go out of his chamber all
his folk that were there / By cause yt he would not repreue him by for them /
After that they were gone. the holy Patryarke said to him / My friend thy
proffer is much necessary. seeng the time of the derthe that we have now / But
nevertheless it is defoylled with the sin of Symonye. In the old testament
men offered not ye bestes to god^ were they great or little / but if they were
pure and clean / For of those that were bespotted man did never offrynge / And
therefore god had not agreeable the sacrefyce of Caym / And as towchyng my
bredern. or ever thyself or I were god had p^rueyed and nourysshyd them / And
he shall yet do so to them and to me as I hope / For all they that keep the
commandments of god / shall not have another need nor pouerte. but all plentee
and habundance of goods / Our lord that multeplyed the.v. loves of barley /
may well multeplye also.x. Rasers of whete that are in my Garnere / And
therefore my friend I shall tell ye for an answer. that which is written in
that tes of thapostles / That is yt thou shall not have in the church another
part nor porco^n And as he said thise words came Incontinent tidings to the
holy Patriarch. how two ships of the church were londed within the haven.
and came out of Cecyle lade with whete / Then^e the holy man thankyd our lord
saying / My god I thank ye that you would not have suffered that I should have
sold thy grace for any need that I have had / Certainly my god I believe
stedfastli. that thou shall never forsake in the grettest need them that shall
obey the / and that with good heart shall fulfylle thy co^mau^dements /

Of two clerks that did fall in to sin / And begynnyth in latin Quibusdam

TWo young Clerks. having questyon together. smote wrongefully each other /
And for this cause by the holy Patryarke John^ they were denouncyd acursyd /
That one of them tweyne knowleged his sin / But the other abydynin his
obstynacy despised the said sentence of cursynge / For he was well glad to
have occasyon for to flee the church. and to abide in his wyckydnesse / And
nevertheless he thretenyd the said Patryarke to dysplayse him in his person
/ And men said comynly. yt it was he that had born to the Patryce Niceta the
money of the church yt was taken under the bed of the said Patriarch / And
that had be yelden again afterward. as it is said before / The malice of this
outrageous acursyd man was showed to the holy Patryarke. but this
notwythstondyng he had of him pity / And remembered the word of the apostle
saint Poul. saying / Who is he yt is seek and not I / Now was the charity of
the said Patryarke so great / ye when he saw one in syn^e. he wept upon him
/ And as to him was aduys. he felt well his sykenesse / He then^e made the
said acursed man to be callid to him / And wa^tyd him of his conscience. as he
was wont to warn his other subgettes / But when he saw his evil
frowardness. and that he was made hard in his sin / He left and forsook
him as a rotyn membre / This nevertheless upon a Sunday. the said Clerk
being yet in his frowardes As the holy Patryarke came to the awter for to
offer his sacryce unto god / after his custom / He remembered him of the
counseylle of Ihesu Christ. that said / When thou shall bring thine offrynge
unto the awter / And that thou shall think that thy brother has some evil
will and hate against the / Thou ought to leave that. yt thou would offer
to god / And goo to him thine enmye for to reconcyle the with him / Wherefore
the holy Patryarke willing to do soo^ sent Incontinent for the said acursyd
man / And made the messager pray that he should come to speak with him under
surete / And when he was come / This holy Patryarke knelyd on his knees before
him And beloughte him of mercy / Whereof it happed that the said acursyd person
had knowledge of his sin. and he himself required mercy / Thorugh his
humylyte was the proud frow^de man mekyd in his pride / And by his charytee.
was the hate of the said acursyd man paste / And fynably he did penance of
the sin that he had done / And had of it great contrycyon and dyspleysaunce /

Of the noise that the holy Patryarke John^ had against the Ruler Niceta / And
begynnyth in latin De^mquidam / Caplm.C.xix.


Never to have noise with a another it is angels life / Sometime to strive the
one with ye other it is man^es life / Evermore to have noise and hate it is a
deuyls life / To this purpose is to be noted. yt the holy Patriarch / for some
right of the law Cyuyl had on a time questyon with the said Patrice Niceta /
The questyon was such. yt the Patrice would have certain trybute to be put and
set of new upon ye people of the land / The which thing ye said Patryarke
would not consent / by cause yt the poor folk should have be hurt thereby
over sore / And for ye great varyaunce that fell thereby. they departed from
each other with wrath the one against the other / Soon after at after none /
about five of the clock / The said holy Patryarke. thynkinge in himself. that
the wise man ought never. to anger himself for no manner cause that it be.
sent his Archedeaken to the said ruler Niceta. and sent him only thise words
Dn^e sol ad occasu^est / That is asmoche for to say. my lord the son is nygh
to goo under / After that Niceta had herd thise words. he cowde not hold his
countenance. but as fulfilled with the fire of the holy ghost cam^ to the
said holy Patryarke. the which when he saw him. he said to hy^ / Alas thou
art welcome the sone of the church and obeyssau^t to her co^mau^dements /
Then^e they did enbrace each other in token of great love. After the which
enbraginces the holy Patriarch began totake the word. and said to him in this
wise / My lord I pray the believe me / For by cause I know ye sore trowbled. I
would well have spoke with the / and for none other cause. I cou^seylle and
warn the ye in time to come you believe no more no reports of false tales and
flaterers For if thou woll lene thine eeres unto such. they shall give the a
cause many euylles to begin / And they shall counseylle the that thing.
which shall not be another leyffull good ne prouffytable / For I have found
myself dysceyued thereby oftentimes / Wherefore to their reports. sayenges.
flaterynges. and false accusacyons. men ought never to give credence nor
faith / Then the Patryce considering the meekness and the fair ensamples
of ye said Patryarke. answerde. that he should never believe such men / Nor
should not give faith and believe to their flaterynges ne to their words / But
he should despise them and set them all at naught / And by this manner
means was peasyd that questyon that was bytwix them for the cause above said

Between one named Gregory which was neuew of the said holy Patryarke and a
Tauerner of Alexandrye moeuyd a great debate / In which this Gregory openly
was sore wronged. by shameful words to hy^ said by the said Tauerner / ye
which Gregory consyderyng^ ye he yt was neuew of the said holy Patryarke had
be thus despised or foul spoken unto openly. and of a man Infamyd. began to
weep right sore / And the holy Patryarke seenge the secret dysplaysau^ce and
sorrow yt his neuewe made / would know what was ye cause / Grogory herupon
examined could not for his great an^e dyscharge nor show his courage in
^^wyse. nor speak with the said holy Patryarke / Nevertheless some yt had herd
and seen the debate. told him a part how it was / The holy Patryarke willing
to hele first his neuew or ever he should inquire ferder of the troth of the
befall. said to him for to comfort him such and like words in substance / My
neuew I am gretely merueyllyd^ and sore evil apayd how yt fool has be so
hold to open his mouth against the / Believe thou me. I ensure the. yt I shall
do this day a thing whereby all Alexandrye shall merueylle / And after seenge
his anger and heuinesse tempred and peasen kyssed his said neuew and said / My
sweet friend if in following this meekness of me. thou woll be my neuew / I
pray the that you woll be utterly agreeable and content^ for to endure and
suffer almanere repreyffes and wrongs of al persons / Certainly it is true yt
the knowledge and kynred comyth more of virtues. than it does of blood / And how
well ye be mine own neuew / Nevertheless for more great sybbe and kynred to have
with me / I pray the yt thou be good and virtues in all thy deeds prayenge to
god yt he woll help and socoure the in all thine aduersytees and that ever he
make the to increase in good works / Now they bey^ge present wend yt the said
Tauerner should have be scorged and beat ch^u^h the town for the repreuynge of
the holy Patryarkes neuewe / But by his great meekness. he did the contrary /
For he commanded that he that took trybute over all the Tauerners. should
take in time coming no trybute of him / And thus he was made free for the
great wrong that he had done to his ^^^we Then^e knew those present that this
was that he would have said that he should do such a thing whereof all
Alexandrye should merueyle /

presented himself before him for this cause The Patryarke seeng his presumco^n.
rebukyd hy^ before the clergy. of the hate that he bare to his euin christian /
And said to him or yt he should receive the blessed sacrament of the awter^ he
would he should reconcyle hy^ to his adversary / For otherwise he should not
admynystre to him the precious body of our lord / Then^e the deaken taken with
great shame. to have be thus corrected afor so many folk. durst not dysobeye

hated so sore. but should take him from thens forth in great love / And then^e

mekely him the said holy sacrament / For reason of the which correcco^n. his
subgets from ye time for the dradde to have hate and rancour the one against the

apperyth yt a good pastor. when he knowyth in his folk and among his subgets

secret and kind exhortaco^ns / he ought to rebuke him sharply and openly. to

But he would not have it full made. to the end that they that should see it.
should have occasyon to tell him that he should do make it up. in bryngyng hy^

trowed to have contynuell remembrance of his death. aslonge as he was alive /

the which had dwelled in the said land of Affryque with a rich man yt kept a
change / And he said that upon a time among other. there as his dwelling
place was the poor folk were gadren at the son^ side in the street. and told
the one to ye other the houses where they most often had almesses. and praised
them much / And in like wise they nombred the houses where they had no

alms of a chaunger that dwelled next him The which Chaunger was master of
the said Patryarkes servant. as he said / That other poor man answered that
never by hy^ nor by none other of his house. was not give him no alms /
Then^e a another of the said pore folk said to them / What woll ye give me if

there at the son^e side. knowing the couetyse and the cold charity of the
Chau^ger / made a wager with the said poor man. Saying that he cowde not get
no thing of him. And he to the contrary said / he should have somewhat of him /

with loves of bread made of Rye for his meyne / Then^e the said poor man
seenge the said Chau^ger and the bread of rye yt was brought to his place with

if he might find a stone for to cast at him / but he fond none. and then^
he took a loof of bread. yt which by great dyspyte he cast at his heed / And
this seenge the poor man took up the bread and went again to his fellows. and
showed it unto them. saying it was yeuen him there / It happed two days
after that the said Chaunger fell syke / and wend well to have deyed / And in
ye sykenesse he had a vysion. which was such / That he must give acounte of

persons. and sore ferdfull for to see. and ye other felyshyp was al white and
full-gracyons and playsaunt for to behold / They that were white said among
them. that in all his works he never did any good deed. But oonly an
alms yt he had done two days before and yet it was against his will / But the
black folk poynted and showed him euylles without nombre by hy^ committed and
done. as well by the sin of Couetyse as of other / And then the said white
folk. desiring to save him fro daungeour^ commanded him that he should
encreace his alms. and also that he should amend his life / Or else the
black persons should evermore tormente him After he was awaked he knew his
vysion to be true / For he hadd seen thereby all that he ever he did in his
youth unto that hour And the said black persons hadd brought the balance
for to weye his misdeeds / but the other had no thing to bring with them
except only the alms that he had do as by constraynynge. and against his
will / Then he said in himself / Alas my god / somoche thou art meke / If
thou grau^test that only an alms which I have give spytefully. to be unto
me somoche worth. as to deliver me out of the power of ye deuyls. How much
good does an alms that is given with meekness and deuoco^n / And from that
time fourth the said Chau^ger was so great gyuer of almesses and so free. that
he spared not his own body / Ones in a morning it befell as he went toward
the chaunge^ that he found a Marynar / the which by fortune had be perysshed
and was left as nakyd as he was come out of his moders belly / The which
knelyd on both his knees before the said Chaunger. and asked his alms / The
Chaunger see^g his pouerte took of his gown. that was the best that he hadd.
and gaaf it him / The poor man that durst not were so good a gown. went
Inco^tynent and sold it to an Vpholster / When the Chaunger going forth by.
knew his gown that heng at the Vpholsters door. and all ready was there to
selle. he was sore wroth and angry / So went he in to his chamber for to weep
and said. alas that I am vnhappi^ I was not worthy that ye poor man should
have be clothed with my vesture / Fynably he fell a sleep / And while he
slepte he saw over his heed a fair and a playsaunt child. that bare a
cross and the gown that the said Chaunger had given for goodis sake / Which
said to him / My friend why wepest thou / The Chaunger answered / Haa my lord
I weep. by cause that of the goods that thou gyuest us / When sometime we give
them to the pore folk. they bystow them in evil vsages / Then he showed
him his gown. saying / My friend. know thou not this gown / with which I
am clothed / I thank the / For certainly I was sore acolde at that time thou
gave it to me / The Chaunger considering the words yt the child said unto him
/ began to praise the poor people in this wise / Sith that the poor folk
represent the person of our lord Ihesu Christ. I purpose that from this hour
forthon. I shall do as the poor people of god done / And then he sent
hastily his Notary. the which he had boughte after the custom that men were
boughte that time / And when he was come to him. he delivered him x. pound of
gold. saying that if he did not his commandment he should selle him to the
strangers and Sarrasyns / The said Chaunger commanded him. that he should
bring him to Iherusalem and that he should selle him to a Christian. And that he
should give such money as he should have for him to the poor folk The
which thing the Notary would not do. but by cause that the Chau^ger thretnyd
him. be feryd himself to be sold / So brought he his master unto Iherusalem
/ And as they were common thither the Notary found a friend of his. that also
was a Chaunger. To whom he prayed for to bi^ his subget. the which was a good
and a true servant To whom this Chaunger answered. that he had not money
enough ready for to pay him / And the Notary said unto him / Certainly I make
the sure if thou take him. that god by him shall give the his blessing

Then the Chaunger bought him for as much as our lord was sold / That it
to wit. the sum of thyrty pens / When he had sold him and delivered him. he
went again to Constantynople / And without to utter his sale gaaf for goodis
sake the money that he had received for him. as he did promise him for to do
/ Then^e Peter the Chaunger thus sold served the Chaunger his master in all
things to him possible / He washed his clothes^ scouryd the dysshes / And
did all that a good servant ought to do And within that de made great
abstynences / The Chaunger seenge his manner of living. and also that he was
well increased in goods sith the said Peter was come to him. would no more keep
him as a servant. but as his brother / And nevertheless by his great
humylyte and goodness he made him self to be beten and wronged of the other
servants of the house / and said no thing there against / Wherefore they
held him for a fool / And as many times and often as he was trowbled of them.
he had such a vysion as ye same that he had seen before in Affryque. of the
child that apperyd to him with his gown which he had gyues for gods sake /
And showed him the thyrty pens. wherefore he hadd be sold / Saying unto him /
Peter have pacyence. and endure yet a little. awaytinge after the reward of
thy labors /

That time came out of his countreye many Chaungers to Iherusalem the cite.
for to worshypp the holy pl^^s / The which Chaungers were ^^ty^ed of the said
Peter's master for to (...) to dinner with him in his house / And when they were
set at the table / They said the one to the other / beholding the said Peter
/ How well is ye servant like unto Peter the Chager / Peter did hide his
vysage as much as he cowde / Thise said Chau^gers yet again thinking ever
upon the said Peter. said to Zoyle the Chaunger that had prayed them to dinner
Certainly Zoyle a great thing is happed unto the / For if we err not. thou
have in thy seruyse a great man / and of a rich house They were not yet
certain of his very knowledge / By cause his face was so sore changed / As
well for the pain that he took in the kechyn / As for the fastings and
abstynences that he made / And after that they had devised long. One of them
said / Certainly it is master Peter the Chaunger / I woll / see him better
anon / The emperor of Constantynople is sore heavy that he knowyth not where
he is become / The good Peter understood thise words / he let goo the dysshe
that he bare: and ran^e down to the gate / To the which gate was a man that
of his birth was both deyff and dombte / The which man kept the said gate.
And when the said Peter came to him. he said to him / My friend in the name
of god open the gate / Then this man both deyff and dombte. that never had
herd. nor spoken afore^ understood Peter Incontinent And to him spoke twyes.
saying /

Well master / Then he opened the gate / And the said Peter fled away /
The which thing seenge this dombte man. came to his master. And unto him
rehercyd the miracle in presence of all they that were at the table / Whereof
they were greatly merueyled and sore abashed / And more over said to them / I
pray you let me god after Peter / For surely he is a great servant of god /
He badde me open the gate in name of our lord / And thus he ran away / Out
of his mouth came a great flamme. that has towchyd mine teres / And
Incontinent the heryng and the speech was yeuen unto me / They all then roos
from the table. and went after him. But they cowde not see him no morere /
The master knowing the virtues of Peter / And the place whereof he was come.
wonderful sorry of that he had boughte him to be his bondsman / And yet more by
cause that he hadd set him to the office of his kechyn / Seenge that he was
so holy a person And pryncypally they that called him fool and from his
wit / When they had knowledge of it. they were sore troubled with all / And
bare therefore great penance / The which hystory rehercyd often the holy
Patryarke / for to moeue the hertes of the Christian to give gladly almesses of
their goods for goddis sake to poor folk /

THe holy Patriarch John^ that was cladde with all virtues / reherced and
showed gladly many good hystoryes / And pryncypally of them. that deuowtely
did their almeses / One day among other it happed. that he reherced and
showed of saint Scrapyon / otherwise called Sydomyen / How that on a time
among other in going by the way. he had given his mantell to a poor man /

And after as he went forth on his way. He found a another poor man / that
was al trowbled for cold / To the which poor man he gaaff his gown / And
abode all nakyd / Beryng only a book of gospels / So was he anon met of a
man / that asked him Who had thus dyspoylled him / To whom in showing the
said book of gospels. with his finger he answered in this manner / The same
has done it / As he would say that she (...) of the said gospels had
constraynyd him to give for goddis sake both his mantell and his gowete / It
happed after one time among other. that he sold the said gospels / And in
likewise gaaf the money that he had for it for goddis sake So after his
clerk unknowing that his master had sold the said book / questyoned of him
where were his gospels / And the said holy man answered him mekely in this wise
/ Truly my sone god has commanded that men should selle all that they have.
for to give to the poor for goddis sake / And therefore have I sold the same
gospels / And the money thereof. I have given for his love to the poor people /

A another thing a more wonderful deed done of the said holy man / A pore woman
went toward him / sayenenge to him in this wise / That she and her children
by great pouertee and ^^ede deyed for hungre / The said holy man seenge that he
had no thing to give to this poor woman. but oonly himself / And
considering if she would selle him to the Greeks / She should well have money
for him For the Greeks had a custom that they boughte men and wymmen
strangers fro their nacyon / And said unto her these worde^. / My friend I

How the holy Patryarke would not harken to the acusacions that men made
against the Relygyouses / And begynnyth in latin Semper quidem Caplm.Cxxviii^
THe holy Patryarke left never no Relygyouses to have any need / So that
they were of holy conuersacyon / And also would not here speak nor harken to
them that said evil by them / Whereof it happed ones. that a Relygyouse that
went from street to street. seeking his bread with a fair young maid / Met
with some evil folk / The which came and showed to the holy man / How that
the said Relygyouse went through the cite / And how he shamyd all other
Relygyouses / The holy Patryarke weninge to correct the sin of the said
Religious made the said maid to be rebukyd. and departed from his felyshypp /
And soon after was the Relygyouse sore beten. and casten in prison / The
night following apperryd to the said Patryarke in his sleep a Relygyous. that
showed him his back al rotyn. and said to him / O Patryarke it is thy will
that it be so done / I promise the that thou haste at this time erryd as a
man / And believe that I say / For the life and the death are nyghe me / And
this saying he went away / The next day following in the morning eerly
the holy Patryarke sent for the forsayde Relygyouse. for to understand if he
cowde know whether it was he of whom the foresaid Vysyon was apperyd and showed
unto him / And when he was brought before him / Seenge his vysage pale. he
was all ashamyd / After by cause he would see his back / for to wit if it was
rotyn as that other that he saw in a vysion / Prayed him that he would
unclothe hym^ and that he should not be ashamyd / The poor relygyous had all
his ly^nes so sore that he had almost no power to re^eue him / Nevertheless
with much pain unclothed himself / And it was found that he had no members
manly and his back was all rotin / Then^e the holy Patryarke sent all his
servants out of ye chamber. and callid to him the said religyous / And asked
hy^ why he ladd that maid with him / Saye^g to him that all folk and
pryncypally religyouses ought to keep hemself from sklaundre and shame / and
above all things fro company of wym^en / The relygyous answerde that it was
not long agoo. that he was in the cite of Gaza^ And as he would have come
thens / after leave taken of his abbot Cirus. the said maid. which was a
Sarrasyn was come to him abowte even. and had prayed him that he would not leave
her by cause she would be Christian / He then^e considering her good will. and
ferynge to offend god / If by his neclygence she had not continued in her holy
purpoos. Hopyng also that the devil should not dysceyue him by her. Had taken
on his way with her. and had born her felyshypp unto the cite of Alexandrye /
Where he had existned her. and sought a place for to have her in to relygyon /
And this doing they asked their breed thorugh the cite / The holy Patryarke
seenge the holy affecco^n that he had to the soul of the good maid. beg^^ for
to cry / Alas how many good servants of god (...) is the world unknown /
And after he gaaf him a^ hundred pens / But the relygyous would none take /
Saying that it was not that he sought / And that all relygyouses that been of
good faith have no need of silver / And if that they have need / Men may well
say that they have no faith / Then the Patryarke bowed his knees before him
and recommended him to god / And after loved. maintened. and lodged the
relygyouses more tenderly than he hadd done before / And after for the great
affection and fervent love that he had to them. did build an hospytall
without the cite of Alexandrye. that he named the hospytall of Relygyouses /

A Great death happed in Alexandrye in the holy Patriarchs days / During the
which death / For to purchase gretter mede / And also for to show a token of
meekness to all other / He went and vysyted the like / and helped to wind
them when they were decessed / And often for to have a contynuell mind of
death / He ^^syd their eyes after that they were deed / And after made deuowte
prays and orysons. for the health of their poor souls / And for to show
that prayers and orysons that been done deuowtely. profyten to the deed / Here
after is rehercyd a fair hystory of a man the which was taken and brought
prisoner in to Perse / And was putt in a prison that is called Lethe / Which
is as much for to say. as Forgetynge Or to be putt out of Remembrance. Some
that fled from thens for to goo in to Ethypre / Passed by the house of the
friends of the said prysonere / And they were questyoned if they had not met
nor seen their kynnesman / Whereat they answered. that wych their own hondes
they hadd buried him / Always it was not the same / But it was a another that
was well like him / And for to certefye the better that it was he. they named
the monyth and also the day that he deyed The said friends by cause they wend
thise men's sayenges to be true. did do make three seruyses every year for
their said kynnesman / That is to wit. one at the feeste of the Epyphanye.
that we call Tweluyfthdaye / the other upon the holy Sunday. that is Trynyte
Sunday. And the third at the feeste of Pentecost. otherwise called
Wytsondaye. It happed that four year after. the said prisoner came again To
whom his friends rehercyd and told him / That by cause men had reported to
them that he was deed. they made for him upon thise days. and every year the
said seruyses / The which thing by him herd of them / He affermyd to them
for a truth / That he being within the said prison / every year. and the
same days. came to him a man all in white. that loosyd him his chains
wherwyth he was bound And preseruyd him from them that kept him / And after
went beryng his chains at his neck without the knowledge of any man /
Wherefore he concluded that oryson prouffytyth much to the prisoners upon the

SVche a another thing we read of the holy Patriarch in the book of the deeds
of thapostles^ yt many deuowte crystens seenge the great compassion yt he had
toward the poor sold much of their goods. and brought the money thereof to
ye holy man for to be dreased by hy^ to the poor / Among the other was one.
that had only but.vii. pound of gold and an half / yt which som^e he
brought to the said holy man. saying yt it was all the gold that he had in
his possesso^n / And as he took him this gold. He said that he had only a
sone of.xv. year of aege. the which with a ship was gone in to Affryque And
by cause he was in great thought and malencolye of that he came not again so
soon as he was acustomyd. besoughte him yt he would pray god that he would save
him his sone and bring his ship again to port salw / ye holy Patryarke was
merueylled of the goodness and^ kindness of this merchant. that had give all
his gold at o^^ alms / So took he soon the said gold. and put it under
a table hallowed prayenge god devoutly for the health of his sone and of his
ship / Thirty days after came tidings that his sone was dysceased. but three
days after the said tidings. his ship came. and also his sone. that
nevertheless was drowned in coming within the haven and the goods within the
ship lost / and there abode oonly but one little boot / All this befall was
reported to the said holy Patryarke And how the fader was more sorry only for
the death of his sone. than for the loss of his goods / ye holy man
considering his great sorrow durst not make him come before him / But
nevertheless he sent him word that he should take his Infortune in pacyence. by
cause our lord made no thing without a cause. all be it yt we know not the
same. or will not know it / And therefore he leuyth never those yt do any good.
but rather when they suffer any aduersitees or trybulaco^ns. if they return
to him soon or late. they ben comforted / Soon after the good marchaunte saw
in his dreme a man like unto the holy Patryarke. ye said to hy^ / My brother.
why trowblest thou thiself. and take so much heaviness / Have not ye prayed
me. that thy sone might be sauyd / Certainly thy prayer is hard. for surely
if he lived. he were in daunge^ur to be dampened. for the euylles that he should
have done / I ensure the if i^ had not be by the gift that thou best done to
me / They of the ship (...) have be perysshyd. and so should not thy sone
have escaped fro euerlasty^ge dampnaco^n The merchant then^ w^ll comforted
awoke. and came to the holy Patryarke. for to show him the caas and thanked him
of his prayer / Then the holy Patryarke heuyng his hondes to heaven said / O
my god I thank the yt thou gladly herest and enhau^cest the prayers of the
poor syn^ars / After he said to the merchant / My friend believe not that this
vysion is come to ye by my prayers. but only by the great faith that you have
had to our lord /

Often times the holy Patryarke John^ went to vysite the pore yt were in a place
called Cesariu^ In which place he had do make mattes and beddyng for to lay
them upon in Winter / With him on a time among other vysityng the said poor
folk was a bishop named Troyle. which made then^e to be brought with him by
one his Attourneye.xxx.li. of gold: for to bye certain plate to serve at his
board / The holy Patryarke yt knew well his Intencyon / said unto him in
speaking of the poor people / Troyle I pray the love the bredern of Ihesu
Christ / After which words thus said by the Patryarke. and well markyd by the
said bysshopp / As all ashamyd commanded to him that bare his gold yt he
should give it to the poor / And after that they came again to the cite / and
as they were in the way / the bysshopp Troyle that was right sorry yt he hadd
given against his will the said.xxx. pound of gold. angered hy^self so sore
for it yt a strong fever took him so fervently yt he was from himself. And
the holy Patryarke when he was come to his house and was set at ye table. sent
for ye said bishop for to come to dinner and take his refecco^n with hy^. but
he answerde yt he might not goo / and that ye fever was so strong upon him yt
he might not rise from his bed / The holy Patryarke knowing him thus syke.
thought it was for great malencolye yt he took for his gold yt he had given
against his will And by cause he knew this bysshopp to be sore vexed and
tormented: And for this cause he might not take his refeccyon / He went to
the bed where he lay syke. and said to him / Troyle be of good there and
comfort And rejoice thyselfe at my coming / Dydest thou ymagyne otherwise

my will to give unto the again all together / Truly my will was so. Hold here

And when he saw in the holy man^es hondes all his gold. he fond himself
as well dysposyd of his coming / as though he had brought a good medycyne /
whereof he should have recovered his good heel / And so the holy man took hy^
his gold again / But in this doing he asked hy^ a letter of his hand. how he
forsook ye merit that he might have got in gyuynge his money for goddis sake^
the which bysshopp made to him a wryty^g whereof the tenor was such / O my
god give to my master John^. Patryarke of the great cite of Alexandrye ye
merit of the xxx.li. of gold that I had given to the poor / people For I have
received them again / The said holy Patriarch kept well the said writing. and
brought the said bishop to dinner with him / To whom after few days. to
the end he were stired to socour gladly the poor people / Our lord gyuer of
rewards. would show in a dreme what reward he had lost / So saw he in this
dreme a great palace* so costelew and so fair builded that al mankind cowde

good Patryarke John^ / and of his holy life / So would be assaye if he might
make hy^ to fall in sin. and namely if he were so constau^t that he never
condemned any person / Then for to perform his unlawful will. he departed
fro his monastery and cam^ in to Alexandrye / And when he was come thither. he
ladde a playsaunt lyfe^ as to men. but unto god right agreeable / First he
wrote all the hours plainly / And that which he cowde wyn^e. he gaaf unto one
of them. and said to her / My friend I pray the give me this night. yt is to
say yt she should abstene herself fro fornycaco^n The said abbot for to keep
her fro evil dedes^ abode with her al ye night. and held himself in a corner
of ye chamber. prayeng god for her till it was day / On ye morn he went away.
and prayed her yt she should tell no bodi yt he had be with her / Many days and
nyghtes he continued this going among them unto the time. yt this was showed
by an harlot. yt nevertheless would not say yt he was a lechour. but he
aco^panyed them only for their health / The good abbot prayed god yt his good
purpoos might not be let by the said dyscoueryng / Wherefore the devil anon
entered in the bodi of the said woman. to the end yt the other should fere to
say as she said in sheweng ye life yt he lad Some yt saw this woman sike said
to her. behold evil woman. thou see now how god punysshyth yt. by cause
that you have lied upon the relygious / Thou have said that he gooth not with
thy fellows for lechery / but you have made a lie / Thise things
notwythstondynge the holy abbot. when he had wrought all day / He at even
desired none other but preche the common wym^en / and said to hy^self Goo we goo
to a another place. there is a woman yt taryeth after ye. Many yt saw his
usual comynycacyon that he had with these wym^en. blamed hy^ for it / but he
answered unto them / Is not god as well wroth with the other as he is with the
relygyouses. they ben men as other ben / Some told him yt he should take a
wife. and change his habyte. by cause he should not be sklau^dred / But he
kept him well that he consented not unto their oppynyon. and only to them he
answered yt they should goo fro him. asky^ge them / Are ye assygned my Iuges. see
to yourselfe. and let me do my will. Fynably he was accusid to ye holy
Patryarke. which would not believe lightly yt men reported unto him. but had in
reme^braunte the other relygyouse. yt in like wise had had be accusyd. as
here before is made menco^n / And for to stynte the reporters. the holy
Patriarch told an hystory of Constantyn the emperor. to whom was like wise
reported by an accusar certain blames in writynge against a religyous / When the
emperor saw the accusaco^n. he sent for the accusar and him yt ^ as accused
And they being aforesaid to ye accusa^ / Truly if I saw a seculer priest or a
relygious yt did any syn^e. I should hyde him with my mantell / to the end yt
his sin should not be known nor seen of other / And thus the holy Patryarke
peased the accusars of ye said abbot. During the said time the servant of god
Vital used as he had acustomed with the common wymen / And with this he prayed
god devoutly and contynuelly. that after his death to some person should ye
cause be showed. by reyson whereof he did hau^te the common wymen. to the^de the
people should not abide by hy^ evil ensa^pled. as also they ought not to be /
For through his prayers. many persons that saw him pray god by night.

ye house of a common woman He met with a lewd haskarde. which for to do the
said sin of lechery went to the house there as the holy man came fro / And at

Knauysshe ypocryte. why amendest not thyselfe of thine ypocrysie / The holy
abbot answered unto him I shall yield the ones such a buffett. yt all
Alexandrye shall come to thy cry A little while after this deyed ye holy abbot
Vytall / and never during his life was the cause know why he drew to ye common

thus the prophecye was in him fulfilled / All thise things were by ye people

wy^men in like wise came thither. which he had converted to goodness And bare

for rayson of syn^e but for to exhort and styre them to do well. and leave
their lecherous life and malice / So were they sore rebuked / that they hadd
not vttred his holy life / But they answerde yt they durst not. by cause that
one of their fellows which had spoken of him had be Incontinent tormented of

But the devil tempted me. and put in my entendement. that ye vpens yt I gaaf
were suffisau^t for to nourysshe my meyne / and by his temptynge I left to give
for goddis sake / After ward retornyng to myself / I commanded to my sone yt
he should rob me each day v. pens. and that he should give them for goddis

god preseruyth that they ben not robbed of the Pirates / or drowned in to the
deppest botomes. But commands the sea that it suffers them to come to

deeds Alas let us thy^ke how our good angel shall be wroth wha^ aft our death he
shall find no good deeds done by us whereby he mite keep and defend us against

dread shall thou then have. when Inconty^^^e after thy death you shall be
presents before the Judgment of god This holy man had ever in his remembrance
the good Symeon that had be so iusce. And yt which when the hour of his death
was come / and that his soul ascended to paradys / met with a great company

order of proud deuylles. And there she was questioned if she had not be
proud. After he met with ye deuylles princes of sklaundrynge / and in like
wise she was there asked if she had not reported evil of other / After this she
met with other deuylles princes of fornycaco^n. the which would accuse him of
flesshely deeds. and flesshely desires / And when the soul is styed unto
he^uen and that she must needs yield acounte before god / the angels give her
no more socours / and has then no comfort ne help but of such good deeds
as he has done in this world / As to this time the good Patryarke considered
how the soul has no comfort but only of her good deeds / And for to move
the more his spyryte / he brought unto his mind the death of saint H^larion.
the which at the last hour of his death. said unto his soul / O my soul goo
hardly out of my body.Lxxx. year thou have served god / Why ferest you now thy
departing / O wonderful a thing / o most dread. o charity unable to be
cold. The good Hilarion ye was ^lxxx. year. and al his life had served god in
doing great penance. and never had syn^ed dedely. but al his days was Joined

This notwythstondyng and that he lived an heavenly life. in making wonderful
miracles. yet he feryd the death. and namely the said holy Patryarke yt said.
What shall thou my soul answer to the horrible accusars that somoche ben

deuyls shall give unto us somany accusaco^ns. As of leesynges. of couetise of
myssayeng of vnpyte. of evil mynde^ of hate. and of all other sins / Then
shall we well need to have good advocates that shall speak for us / For ye
great fere yt we shall then have shall keep us that we shall not answer no
thing / And therefore we must pray god that we may have good angels for to lead
us in all our deeds. when that we oonly goo fro one cite to a another. we take
our guides / to the end that they led. us the straight way / Then^e must we
well pray when we shall depart from the earth to heaven / that we be not ladde
from our straight way. but ledd and guyded by good conduytours / This holy

THis mean time the holy Patriarch ordained two ordres of relygyouses / and

holy man by ye said entysy^ges continued them /

How men ought to eschew the company of Heretykes / And begynnyth in latin Et
hoc beatus / Caplm.C.xlix
Above all other things this holy man defended unto ye christian. that they
should another common nor acompanye with the heretykes / Saying that it was more
worth to a christian to be all alone / than to be acompanyed with an Heretyque /
And more over he said. that like as a wedded man should be punysshyd if he left
his wife. and wedded a another somwhere in a another land / So should a christian
be punysshyd / that should leave the comynycaco^n with his like for to acompanye
with the Heretics / And more over sith yt we ben married to a wife sure and
chaste. which is the holy church christian / if we leave it for the comynycaco^n
of Heretics / We ought as fornicatours to be grievously punisshed and stoned
of ye deuyls of hell / asmoche as we should be if we had had ye flesshly company

How ye holy Patriarch iuged nor co^de^pned never no body / Begyn^ith in latin

Among the other great virtues yt this holy Patryarke had^ namly he had one
right great. which was such / yt he never iuged no person. nor also would not
here them ye said any evil by a another / To this purpose is to be know. yt he
being in Alexdrye. a young man rauisshed a right fair regyous maid. and ladde
her with hy^ unto Constantynople / This thing came to his knowledge. and
considering ye loothnes of the befall. And for the great charytee that he had
to the health of man / He was so sorry for it. that it semyd he should have
deyed / And a lytyl while after that this caas was so happed / He being with
some clerks / and dysputynge of holy scryptures / came in his remembrance the
said befall / In speaking of the which by cause al those present. Iuged this
foresaid man a right great and abhomynable synnar They would have him acursyd
But the holy Patriarch would not perform the same Saying that there should be
cause of two euylles / First in that they should do as he said against the
commandment of god. and should break it / By cause it is written. that we
ought not to judge any body / And we shall not be Judged / The second evil
for that they wyste not if the said clerk had wythdrawe the said relygyous
woman out of her monastery / for to do evil with her / And was not yet known
whether he had defoylled her or not / Wherefore they ought not to cast upon him
the said sentence of cursynge / For men ought not to Judge but this that men
see to be evil done / And for to conferme his word. he rehercyd of.ii.
relygyouses. among whom was one / which passing thorugh the cite of Thyre
met with a strompett common. named Porphyre / The which cried after the abbot
/ O fader save me like Ihesu Christ saved the woman synnar / The abbot that
fered not ye speech of the world said unto her that she should come after hy^^
and she did so The same abbot brought her by ye hand before all the people out
of the cite of Thyr / The which thing was anon told / But this
notwythstondyng ye abbott turned never from his good purpoos / But in gooynge
by the way ye one with the other / Hoping this holy man to have her in to some
monastery of relygyouse wym^en / walked together so long that they came to a
church. at the entree of which they fond a much fair child that lay on
the ground / The which this Porphyre moeuyd of pity and compassyon. took and
bare bytwyx her arms. and since nourisshed him in the said abbots monastery /
yt which soon after made this Porphire a woman of religyon. and made her to
be called Pelage / Before that she^ was relygyous. and she being yet in the
said abbots monasteri. Merchants came thither of the cite of Thyre. yt well
knew the said Pelage / And seenge yt she had a child. said to her / Haa d^me
ye have brought forth a fair child to the abbot / Many other dyspytes the
said to her. and to the abbot also / Vi. or vii. year after yt the child was
great. ye abbot knew by ye will of god yt in short time he should deye / and
for this cause he gaaf to understood unto this. Pelage. yt he must needs for
certain causes go unto the said cite of Thyr / and so commanded her to make
ready herself thyderwarde with him: and that she should take her child with her
/ Pelage that would not dysobeye him. took the child. and they three together
went in to the said town / And when they were came thider. the abbot lay
Incontinent syke in his bed / Then^e were tidings showed through the cite. how
the abbot that had ladde away Porphyre the ^^^yn woman was at point of
death. And anon went and vysited him more than a hundred persons in nombre In
presence of whom. and also of Pelage and of the young child / The abbot called
after cooles quycke glowyng / And Incontinent that they were brought to him /
He putt them upon his gown / and said this / My bredren believe. that like as
god kept sometime before Moses the busshe brennynge without to be apayred nor
burnt / And as at this present hour he keeps my gown from harm of thise
cooles glowynge / Thus for very certane I tell you. that I never knew the
sin of this woman^ whereof I am accused / Showing to them being present the
same woman and the child / All they were merueylled. and gloryfyed god of the
miracle / And anon after that the holy abbot had taken away the false
oppynyon that they of Thyr had over him. he bytoke his ghost in the hondes of
our lord /

For this cause the holy Patryarke for said deffended that folk should not
give no sentence over the young man that had brought the woman of Relygyon
out of her monastery. as it is above said / More over said the holy Patryarke
that how well men seen often the sinners perform the sin of fornycacyon /
Nevertheless men ought not to despise them. nor report synnars / For men
know not what secret penance they have done for to decerue the grace / And
in like wise this he said of all other synnars / Such ben playsauntly clothed.
and well arrayed that who so should take his vesture from his back. dame
Penance under his clothes should be found /

Of two Clerks that made shone. and begynnyth in latin Duobus clericis etc^
Caplm.C.li.


DVrynge the time that the forsayde holy Patryarke dwelled in Alexandrie. two
clerks were there yt made shone for to get their living The One had many
chyldern to feed / And beside this he nouryshed his fader and his mother / And
how be it that he was constrained to work contynuelli for cause of the great
charge that he bare / Nevertheless he served god daily and herd mass. saying
many prayers and orysons / But that other had his thought all set upon his
work / And not oonly the days that were suffered and assygned to do lawfully
all manner of hondwerke. But also he wroughte upon the sondayes / and upon all
other solemn days. wherein is for boden that no manner of hondwerke should be
vsyd / And namely through the great lust that he set to his work for lucre of
money. he slouthed the service of god. and herd never mass / But what soever
pain that he took. he might not live nor mayntene hy^self. Where by he fell in
envy against his fellow And asked him how it might be that he was richer than
he^ seenge the great charge that he had. and also yt he wrought not so much
as he did / This other desiring to styre his fellow toward god. and to serve
him. said unto him / That he had found a tresour in the ground / whereof he
was become rich / And that if he would keep him felyshypp and goo with him. he
should give him part of that he should find / Where unto he was agreed /
Promising to here him company and to goo with him where some ever he would
led him / Under shadow of which promise. the servant of god set him many
days for goo here mass / And so much he vsyd him therein / that he cowde not
leave. but that he went every day to ye church for to here mass. and serve god
/ And afterward he wexed so rich. that lytly without need he had from that
time forthon to live more honestly without comparyson than he did before /
Whereby it apperyth that we ought first to seek the reame of heaven / And god
shall socour us in our deeds / The holy Patryarke forsayde when he knew how
this good faithful hadd converted his fellow to serve god / By cause also him
thought he was worthi to be a priest for was he ^^tred ynou and of good manners
/ he ordened him to the holy order of preesthode /

How the holy Patriarch was called of god for to decesse out of this world And
begynnyth in latin Et quidem Caplm.C.lii.


IT happed by the suffraunce if god that Alexandrye was subdued of them of
Perse by force of arms / The which aduersytee ser^ge this holy man / and
considering ye godly counseyle. which is written in holy scripture. saying /
If one ^egyo^ is contrary / Goo to a another / He made his purpoos to return
in to Ethyper. in the cite where he was borne / The which thing knowing the
Patry^s Niceta required hy^ besyly that he should goo to the cheyf cite of the
citees for to exhort the emperors to live virtuously / The holy Patryarke
that never refusyd no thing that was leyfful and good to no manner of person
/ consented for to goo with the said Patryce / The ships were Incontinent
made ready. and they took the sea / It happed by the will of god that the ship
wherein were thise Patryarke and Patrice. was in daungeour to be drowned /

The holy Patryarke then^e took upon him for to comfort the poor folk yt
were in the same vessel / And with them he called ye grace of almighty god
So saw he in this stormous tempeste a man vpryght before him / Having the
face of a wonderful britnesse holdy^ge in his hand a ceptre al of gold / The
which man said to him / Patryarke come on. for the king of. kings askith for
the / Then the holy Patryarke thinking upon the said vysion / Incontinent
he called the Patrice Niceta unto him and with great syghes and teeres he
showed it unto him Saying how the emperor of emperors regnynge in heaven had
called him And that without fawte he might not goo to the emperor of the earth.
to whom the said Niceta would bring him /

The good Patrice herynge the words of the holy Patryarke. was much sorry of
his departing. and glad of his health / So sent he him again there as he
would goo / That is to wit in the reame of Chypre in the cite of Amathanque /
where he had taken his ^^tynite /

The form of his Testament folowyth / And begynnyth in latin Adueniente /
Caplm.C / liii.


AFter that the holy Patryarke was come in Chypre in ye cite named Amathu^que
where he was borne / He asked after pen and ynke and for a skyn^e of
parchemin / And in contynent he made his Testamente to be written in manner as
here folowyth I John^. first bond and since afrau^chised and made free by the
dygnytee of preesthode: of the grace of god to me yeuen To the my god I yield
graces. of that it has pleysed the to enhau^ce my prayer to the we will of my
soul / It is yt at the hour of my death men shall find in my tresour but
only do piece of money / When I was promoted to the dignytee of Archebysshopp
ensacred and received in the holy church of Alexandrye / The which dignytee
by the leave and Inspyraco^n I have obtained. I fo^de there tresours without
nombre / I then^e knowing yt the said tresours were bylongyng to god purposed
to yield unto him again that yt was his own. and by cause yt now of all the
said tresours is to me in remaynyng but only the pyece of money foresaid.
which bylo^gyth unto god^ I command yt it be give unto him again in to the
hondes of the pore folk his servants / O thing right glorious and worthy to
be rehercyd. O ye rich yt happily have gadred your money and tresours unjustly.
the which ye woll keep and hold as your own. and no thing wol give for
goddis sake. but hyde and keep them as. ye might bear them with you / Look now
with me in this myrrour. consydryng how the holy Patriarch gadred a tresour yt
never can be mynysshyd. as worldly riches is / Certainly we ought to bileue yt
he is worthy to be glorified / For our lord says in his gospel / Who soever
shall honor or gloryfye me. I shall gloryfye hy^ / It is so yt for the worship
of our lord. and for to exalte his praysynge. he founded many monasteryes. in
which he ordened great multitude of Relygyouses / yt contynuelly gave lawde
and praysynge to god For which cause is to him rewarded yt merit of all the
orisons there made of the said relygyouses / And to the end yt by fable and
lesynge. this yt before is of him written be not reputed / We have thereof a very
knowledge. that he was of the nombre of the Just / For after that he had yielded
his holy soul in to the hondes of our lord god. as done the souls of the
Just that are in the hand of god / His sepulture was by the clergy ordened in
a sepulcre. wherein of long time before two good bishops his Predecessors had
be buried / But a wonderful thing happed there / For at the openyng of the
said sepulcre. the two bishops that there rested their bones of long space
deed and byreuyd of life. wythdrewe theymself fro their places / Making honor
to the said Patryarke. and gyuyng unto him his place between them in the
mids of the grave / Whereby it is to us openly showed that our lord him
rewarded much largely^ when he would his body in this world to be so openly
honored / And his soul above in heaven gloryfyed. and worshypfully enhaunsed /

Of the woman that gaaf her sin in writing to saint John^ the Patryarke /
And begynnyth in latin Aliud autem / Caplm.C.liiii
YEt living the said Patryarke Johan. he made a another miracle right great.
the which begynnyth in his life. and ends after his death / A woman of the
said cite where he was borne. had done so horrible a sin / that she durst
never confess it / So it happed that the said Patriarch came to the cite /
And she having knowledge of his coming. came and cast herself at his fete /
saying by great coutrycyon / O reverend lord I have done a sin the which
for the great loothlynes of it I dare not confess / But this notwythstondyng I
wot well. that if it playse yt thou shall give me thereof remyssyon / The holy
Patryarke seenge her great contrycyon / He would not correct her rygoriously /
Doubtyng that she should never make shryfte thereof to a another / And that by
this she were in dangeour of her soul. but said unto her / My friend if thou
haste that faith that I may cleanse thy soul fro sin. and that I may give
the remyssyon thereof / Confess it unto me. and I shall do all that thou
requyrest of me / Whereunto she answered that she should not dare tell it / For
it was so dyshoneste and shameful that it should cause horror at the ceres
of the holy man / Then he said unto her Thus then if thou art so
shamefaste of the confession of it / give it unto me by writing / She yet
answered that she should not dare do so / And the holy man yet again said
unto her / Thou must do it. but if it seem the good / thou shall close the
letter in such wise. that no body may see it / Then this woman consentyng
to the words of the holy Patryarke / wrote her sin with her own hand And
after closyd the letter. and took it to him / But he ne lived but five days
after that / So it happed by casuell adventure. that at his death this we man
was out of the town / When she came again. and knowing his deceasse / She
ymagyned that her sin had be showed thorugh all the cite / by cause that the
holy man was deed / having toward him her scrowe / And as for answer
thereupon. she had none of / So went she to his tomb where he was buried /
And there she kept herself three days without any mete or drink / Making
there wayllynges without nombre and wepynges / Having always an hope that
the holy Patryarke should let her understand some tidings of her sin / She
often said unto him / Alas holy Patryarke I hadd so great an hope of thy life.
the which I believe not to be ended. For god and his church. wytnessen unto
us. that the Just live euerlastyngly / And therefore I believe that thou art
not deed / But rather art more living. as to the everlasting lyfe^ than thou
were before in this world / Alas my friend. I ne require of the none other
thing / but oonly that thou wolte let me wit. where my scrowe is become that
I took the / O my sovereign god that said to the woman Canan^e That thorugh her
faith she was sauyd / Sith that I have in the steadfast believe. that thou
may make me at this time acertayned of my scrowe / I byseche the / that thou
woll be playsed I to have it again / One a day she saying such words / The
holy Patryarke acompanyed with two bishops. with the which he was entered.
aroos out of his gaue^ and said to the said woman / O poor and nedy woman
why leuest thou not in rest them that been here with me / Thou have wept so
much that we ben all bedewed with thy teeres / And with this he took her
again her scrowe / And asked her if she knew it / The which words said. he
and the said two holy bisshops. laid theymselfe down again within their
tombs / And the said woman opened her letter. And found therein written the
words that here follow. For the love of Johan my servant thy sin is
enrased out / O what is he that cowde or might reherce the power of our
lord. the which is so merciful. and lovely both to men and wymmen / And
that so freely grauntyth and does the will of all those that dread him / And
that with good heart sekith him / Which gloryfyeth them that love him / And
by miracle magnyfyeth them /

The holy Patryarke foresaid was not only gloryfyed in one place. but in all
countrees of the Eest parties / And now saint Iherom makyth us to know him
ferdermore in these parties of the Weste /

accompanied with a great nombre of clerks. was ladde by one of them tofore an
emperor in his palace / After he saw him come out of the gate / The which
vysyon bytokened the departing of his body from the soul When he was out of
the gate. came to him a fair lady. a young maid shynynge bryghter than the
son / Having on her heed a crown of Olyue tree^ The which took him anon
by ye hand. and ladde him forth / By this visyon the good relygyouse man
ymagyned that the holy Patryarke was passing out of this world at that hour
unto everlasting glory. And this he gaaf to know unto diverse persons. It
happed then^e that out of Chypre came many merchants in to Alexa^drye To
whom was askid after the hour of the Patryarkes foresaid death / And by their
answer was clearly know. that the said vysyon was true / And that at the same
hour that as the Relygyouse man had showed it. the said holy Patryarke was deed
/ Gyuyng steadfast faith by this that said is to this vysion and namly for cause
of the maid that ladde him by the hand / For they Judged that is was Almese /
that before time in this world had showed herself to this holy Patryarke
foresaid in likeness of a maid / And had promised him as here before is said /
That if he would love her / she should present him before the sovereign

In septimo igitur. et cetera Caplm.C.lviii.
Sometime an Emperor of ye Romans named Chomodrus for to rule and govern the
cytee of Alexandrye. and the land of Egypt. under the lordshyp of Rome. sent
in to the same country one named Phylyp. The which departing out of Rome
took his wife Claudia with him. two his chyldern / named Anitus and Sergius /
and a daughter of his called Eugene They togider came in the cite of Alexandrye
/ This Philyp as great Provost and governor there rulynge the cite and all the
country after the ordenaunce of the laws of Rome put out and brought down
the cursyd sect of the magicyens. that in great nombre and of long time had
by their fendly craft Infected and poysened all the land / Secondly he
commanded that the Jews should no more bear a name in all that land / And
after he ordained that the Christian should abide and dwell in the country. but
not within the cytees. But without far enough from the same. There ye said
Eugene was wonderfulli learned. as well in Greek lettres and latin as also in the
science of Phylosophye She had a wit so quick and so sharp. ye light and
steadfastly she held all yt she radde. or that to her was expow^^^ The face of
her was much playsaunt She was fair and praty of body / but more fair in
thought. and in chastytyte (...) steadfast and noble / When she came to her
fyftenth year of aege. many lords co^syderyng her great perfecco^n. made her
to be asked to her fader for to have her by marriage / And among the other she
was desired of one named Aquylyen. the sone of Aquyn Consul of Rome / But her
fader that exposyd and showed unto her the extracco^n and nobles of the said
Aquylyen. for to enduce her to this that she should be agreeable to mary with
him / She wisely answerde. yt a maid that has a will to mary. ought to have
her husbo^de agreeable wha^ she is noble of virtues. and not only of noble
kynrede / For when a woman is wedded she is constrained to follow ye manners of
her husbo^de. and not of her fre^des / And fynably to this Aquilien and to all
the other she gaaf an answer. yt she would not mary. but had in her purpose
that should live chastely / And by cause that Phylyppe her fader had chaced all
the Christian folk out of the cite. nevertheless she desiring to common with
them / And to the end yt her fader that was a Panym should have no knowledge of
it. nor suspecco^n. prayed hy^ mekely. that he would suffer yt she might goo
by manner of sport unto the subarbes of Alexandrie for to see some of their
lands and herytages there lyenge nigh The which thing was granted unto her
of her fader / And so it happed as she went fore by a church of ye christian
that she had herd sing these verses) Omnes dii genciu^ demonia. deus aute^

/ But the god that we Christian do worshypp has made the heuens and the earth /
When Eugene herd this song. she began to weep. saying to.ii. Emyches. that is
two men yt lack their members of mankind. The one named Prothus and the other
Iacintus. that were committed to keep her and serve her / as comynly it was
done of custom to the daughters and wy^men comen of good houses / My friends
I know that you and I have been taught and informed together. as well in the
laws of men. as in the vain science of the Philosophers And have radde the
falages of Aristole. the ydes of Platon^ the sect of ye Epicuriens. the
techynges of Socrates. and of the Stoyciens. and generally all the doctrine of
the Poets and Rethoryciens But all thise vayn science are put out and set
aside by that little verse that I have herd sy^ge by ye Christian) Om^s du
genciu^ demonia. etc (Ye call me your lady thorugh the power of my fader
which he has over you mysusyd / but I am your sister in science / Be ye
then my bredern. and I shall be your sister / Let us goo to the Christian /
And as I shall command you. we shall do I know the bisshopp of Leopolis
named Helayn / In whoos house men singe contynuelly. ye holy scryptures / The
said bishop has under hy^ many holy relygyouses / And among other one there
is named Theodore. the which is leder of them that done the dyuyne service /
Thorugh his prayers and his orisons he makith the blind to see. chacyth the
deuylles out of the bodies of men / Diverse wretches in great sorrow abiding.
by his prayers aren of their sykenesse fully helyd / And the desolate
recomforted / Wherefore I have a synguler desire to goo unto him / And for to
do this. I woll do cut my heeres. and clothe myself with the clothinge of a
man / Therefore I pray you as my bredern that this for to do ye wol help me /
The said kepers knowing her holy devotion. and desiring as she to become
Christian. gaaf her for to fulfill her will all comfort and aid / So lepte she
out of the chare / wherein she was carried. And clothed her in man's clothing /
And by the suffraunce of god Incontinent as they were come in the church. they
met with ye said bisshopp Helayn / The custom was in Egipte such that when
the bysshopp went to vysyte the chyrches. a great multitude of Syngers came
with them (Thus with the bysshopp Helayn came mo than.x. thousand ye song
before him saying / The way of the Just is made veryte. and ye way of the
saints of god is made redi Eugene this seenge said to her fellows / My
fre^des here the substance of this song / Look how the god of ye Christian is
good to them. that woll hold the faith of christ take heed how they know that
we woll leave our Ydoles for to be Christian / And for this cause they are come
against us in such a great multitude of devout peple^ that sing so sweet a
song / Let us behold which way they shall goo / and Join ourselfe with
us. So shall we synnge till yt we have knowledge with them / Then they began
to question some of that felyshypp / And asked what was he yt was in the mids
of them riding upon an Ass / The which answered that it was their bysshopp
Helayn that of his yongthe was a Christian man / And of so great merit toward
god That of his young aege he made diverse miracles / In berynge of fire in his
gown. which was no thing perysshed by it^ and other also wonderful /
Among the other Religyouses one named Eutropius rehercyd to Eugene and to her
fellows / How with in few days passed yt a magicien named Zaree was come
thither / And had showed. that the said bysshopp was a false Christian man / And
that falsely he said he was sent by Ihesu Christ for to dysceyue the people /
The which Magycyen was full of wyles. and subtle / And turned many from the
faith and believe of holy scripture / For the which things. the pryncypall
Cyteyzyns of Eliopolis were come to the bysshopp Helayn / And had told hy^ how
the forsayde Magycyen said himself was sent of god. and not he. And for this
cause they would have constrained the said Bysshopp to receive him as his fellow
/ Or else to overcome hy^ as a Dysceyuour and begyler in ouercomynge his
Magycall argumentacyons / And upon this was a day chosen and set / Upon the
which in the mids of the cytee were come together the Bysshopp and Zaree the
Magycyen. The which trusting in his cursyd ymagynacyons. hoped to have turned
and overcome of light ye people from the faith of Ihesu Christ our Sauyoure /
But the good Bisshopp Helayn himself byleuynge in the faith of our Savior
had said to the people being present / O Christian people ye shall know this
day which spyrytes ben of god. and which ben not / The Magycyen that was
much subtyl sect all his cure to putt the bysshopp under fete by force of
Arguments / Wherefore the bisshopp wisely considering the Instruccyon of saint
Poul. saying to his dyscyple Thymothee / I forbydde the to dispute by
Paraboles. For such Arguments serve oonly. but to subuerte thoos that here
them / For to eschew Incouenient that should have now fall to the great
hurt of the Christian people / Herynge the Sophystycall dysputacyons of the said
Zaree / Required before all the people a great fire to be kyndled / And that they
both together should enter. therein / And he that should not be burnt. should
call himself ryghtfully the very Servant of god / And his law to be taken
as the best / The which request was to all being present right agreeable

Wherefore a great fire was anon kyndled / And that done the Bysshopp required
the Magycyen that he should enter in to the fire / The which thing he
refused. Saying to the bysshopp Helayn that it was reason sith that he had
first purposyd / That also he ought to entree first within the fire / So
blessed himself this holy Bysshopp with the sign of the cross. and entered in
the mids of the fire / Abiding within the same the space of half an hour /
And then came heloute of the fire without any hurt of his body. nor his
clothes perysshed in any manner / The people seenge this wonderful miracle.
would compelle the said Magycyen to entree within the fire after him / But he
trowed to have fled away / Aad this notwythstondyng he was take. and by
force was putt in to the fire. of which Incontinent he was be clippedd and
taken all about. The holy man this seeng lept in to the fire again. and
wythdrewe therfrom the said Magycyen. as half deed / Whereof of al them of the
Regyon he was much honored and taken in great reverence When Eugene had
understand well all that Eutropius had rehercyd unto her of the holy bysshopp
forsayde / She that as above it is said was clothyd in manes clothing. fell
down to the fete of the said Eutropius / Gyuynge him to understand. that
she. Iacintus and Prothus were three bredern / Which had purposyd to live and
deye oonly Joined together in the Christian relygyon / So prayed she him. that he
would present them unto the said bysshopp Helayn / For they would require of
him. seenge their said purpoos / that it would playse him to do somoche for
them that they should never be departed the one from the other. Then^ to them
said Eutropius. that they should tarry till that he had be in the church And
when he should see his hour couenable / He should reherce unto the bysshopp
all thees things / When the holy bisshopp was come almost to the church. The
relygyouses came against hy^ singing such a song / O god we have received in
the mids of thy people thy mercyfulnes / And anon every body entered in to ye
church / and song together the hours of the day unto Sexte Also entered
therein Eugene and her fellows / The bysshopp after this would take his rest a
little / And in that sleep / he had a vysion. by the which to him was showed
that he would goo to thymage of a hethen woman. to the^de yt he should make
sacrefyce unto her / and then in this vysion him semyd yt he said to them
that kept it and that were abowte her / I pray you let me speak with your
goddess. and they granted him the same / Then^e he went to her and said / O
poor woman know that you art a creature of god. come down and suffer no more
that men worshipp the / When the goddess had understand his purpoos. she came
down to ye bysshopp. to whom she said / My friend I shall never leave the till
yt thou have restored me unto my maker / All this visyon saw the holy bysshopp
/ and whan^e he woke. Eutropius. to whom Eugene had spoken came toward him /
which thought yet upon his vysion / He said to the bysshopp / Sire here are
in your church three young children yt are bredern the which of one assent
have purposyd to forsake the Paynym law / and desire to be of the nombre of
the Christian / And to this intent they have followed the long this day /
Desyryng to have space and time that they might speak with the. for to have of
our faith a very knowledge / The holy bysshopp yielded graces unto our lord of
that spyrituelly he had showed to him this thing or ever it was happed / So
sent he for them / And as they were come before him. he took Eugene by the
bond / gyuynge teeres out of his eyes. And drew them aside / After he asked
them of their names. of what nacyon / and of what friends they were / Eugene
answerde that they were brethern. born in Rome. and that she was called
Eugenius: and her bredern were called the one Prothus and the other Iacintus
And then the bysshopp knowing by the foresaid vysyon the said Eugene to be a
vyrgyn / He said unto her / Verily with good right thou art called Eugenius /
For thou bereste the very courage of a man in vndertakynge a work. which is
virtuous / The truth whereof has ben^ unto me showed this day by my god /
that by a vysyon has showed the unto me / And the which that I have thus
presently known has made ready in the his house right agreeable. By cause thou
haste purposyd thy vyrgynytee to be reseruyd unto him / In dyspysynge all
worldly delectacyon / Wit it that for to keep the chastyte thou shall suffer
many eueles / but that same my god. whom thou haste fully and holy given
thyself shall not leave the / After this holy bishop Helayn turned his word to
Prothus and to Iacintus. and said to them / Ye that are servants / and
wytholden in thraldom / Ye have in your hertes great noblesse / I may say to
you that ye our lord said to his discyples / From hens forth I shall no
more call you Servants / But I shall call you my Friends / More over said
unto them this holy Bysshopp Helayn / My children understand it that ye ben
well happy and gracious of this that ye have consented to the holy ghost. in
obeyenge and enclynynge to his holy ma^uynges / For through that mean ye shall
be parteners together of the Joy of heaven / In this astate abode ye good Eugene
in ye clothy^ge or a seculer man unto the time that by the holy bishop she was
regenerate of the holy Sacrament of baptesme. And by him ^n to a monastery of
relygyon. where she desired for to be / But for to have very knowledge how she
departed pryuely from her Parents / It is to be noted yt in those days. when
the ladies would goo to sport theymself. they were of a custom born in a
chare. governed with some young chyldern. called Emiches. or more plainly to
speak. men ghelded. the which being with them. as well for to serve them. as
for to keep them / Now then with Eugene gooyng to her sport. as it is said
above. were Prothus and Iacintus. that for to serve and keep her abode with her
/ The which by mean of her desiring were content to do as she would / And
so in deed they went with her / as above is showed / And sent home again the
lyttere by some young children that had born^ them company / The mother of the
good Eugene seenge the young chyldern come and the lyttere was very glad /
hoping that her daughter was coming in the same chare or lyttere / But after
when she knew her daughter to be gone / She began to cry so wonderfully that
all the cite was moeuyd with it / Eeuery body wept and wayled the loss of the
good lady Eugene / The fader and the mother sighed after their daughter. And in
like wise the brethern after their sister / The which for to find was made
dilygent seeking through all the Prouynce / The dyuynours or southsayers were
sent fore / And by sacrefyces and dysceytes of the devil. the gods were
mekely required that they would give an answer where Eugene was become / All
ye southsayers said yt ye gods had rauisshed her above ye heue^s / The fader
byleuyng this to be of troth. turned his heuinesse in to gladness. and made
the people to keep a feast of thanswere that the gods had give of his
daughter / And moreover for to honor and enhaunce the name of her deed / did
do make a figure or image after her likeness. Whereto he gaaf a great and
merueyllous quantyte of fine gold The which image he adoured and worshypped it
as he did his gods / But nevertheless her mother Claudia and her bredern /
Anitus and Sergius cowde not take in this folly any comfort / All thy
se^thynges notwythstondynge / the good Eugene in clothing of^ man and
unknown abode in the said monastery with the Relygyouses of the same / As it
is said here above / And so well she studied. that in a little while she
comprysed all the rules of the Relygyon / She was so kind and lovely. that
all the brethern thought and held her for an angel / Her words were sweet.
and her meekness so great / that she ouerpassed all the other relygyouses.

She was ever the first in prayer. she comforted the sorrowful. she showed
herself glad with those that were Joyous / They that were full of wrath she
with one word made them to be pacyent in their behauynge / The proud by her
example wonderfully she converted. like as a lion had be turned by her in to a
sheep / She had this merueyllous gift of god that al persons yt she vysited
in their sykenesse. felt at her coming to them no sore at all. Prothus and
Iacintus followed her contynuelly / and were obeyeng to her / The.iii year after
she was put in ye said religyon thabbot of her monastery deyed / so they
together chose with one acorde ye virgyn Eugene for to be their abbot. She
then^e consydryng yt she was a woman and doubtyng to be set in auctorytee
aboboue ye men / Ferynge also of the other part to be seen yt she should dispyse
and co^tempne the prayers of all the Religious yt so besily desired her to take
upon her the auctorytee of the abborshypp. said unto them / O my bredern I
require you in ye name of god yt the book of the gospels may be now presently
brought and showed before us all. And anon as it was brought. she said again
to the^ Ever when any religious have for to be done some elecco^n. they ought
before all things to desire and call the help of our lord Ihesu Christ / Let
us see then in this your elecco^n. what thing he co^mau^dith for to be do.
to the end that we may obey to his devout wamynges / Also to obey the
commandments that shall be by you done in this byhalfe / The holy Eugene
took then^e the book of the gospels. and began to torn a leef and sin a
another. till she fond a gospel conteynyng ye words yt here after are written.
the which she rehercyd saying / In those days said Ihu^ Christ to his
discyples. ye know yt the princes and lords ought to be. and are more great
in auctoritee and power than the men upon whom they have great lordshypp and
might / But this thing is not like among ye other. For if any of you woll be
the formeste. he shall be the last And if any among you woll be a lord he
shall be a servant / After saint Eugene said to them / Therefore my bredern
considering all these things. and not willing to say against you / I have
purposyd to take upon me the auctorite that ye give me over you / And
pry^cypally derysyrynge to obey the commandment of god. ordeyne miself the least among ye other. that are to me much dear and agreeable / Of the which
answer they were much abashed / But this notwythstondynge she presumed not
to use the dygnytee as the most great above all other / But mekyng herself
took the charge that the most low and poor person had being under that
Covent / That is to wit. to here water. cleue wood / And made her dwelling in
that self place where the Potter dwelled / to the^de she should not show
herself gretter than he / With this she had a contynuell thought. and a holy
cure of the things that were necessary to be had for the refecco^n of the
b^^der^ / In saying psalms and orysons she kept soueraynly a good order / And
to all ye hours of the service of god. as well by night as by day. so
curyously continued. that she thought all time to be lost that was passed
without graces and praysynges to be given unto god / In this holiness of life
she continued in such wise / and so long That our lord granted unto her
so great habundance of graces. That she chacyd out of men^es bodies the deuels
that tormented them / Made the blind to see. and many other great miracles
she did / Among ye which a lady of ye land of Alexa^drie named Melance /
among other was of great power. he^ he great report that every man made of
the merueylous virtues of ye holy virgin Eugene. which was take as a rit holy
man. came to her for to be helped and heled of a great fever yt a year dury^ge
and more had vexed her body right sore^ The which Eugene enoynted with an oil
and anon this woman cast out of her body the corrupt humors yt caused within
her ye fever. and all hoole and so side went home again to her place yt was not
far. Where she took the great goblets and filled them with money. which she
sent unto saint Eugene / The which dispysyng ye said presents. sent them
unto her again forthwyth / Letyng her wit. yt of gods she had over much /
Wherefore she cou^seyled her that she should deal and depart to the poor nedy
and nedfull the gods and presents that she had sent to her / The said Mela^ce
heryng these words was greatly wroth. and came toward saint Eugene / prayeng
her yt she would take and receive agreatly her presents. promysyng to give her
other more grete^ but in efect she lost her time. For saint Eugene would not
take them / This notwythsto^ding Melance left not. but she come toward ye good
Eugene / and not knowing by any wise yt she was a woman / the beauty of her
disceyued ye said Melance. the which trowynge yt she had be a man and that by
hy^ she was heelyd / Not by his holiness. but by some craft or cunning of
physik. let herself fall by the temptynge of the devil in to the sin of
flesshly desire / And thinking that the said Eugene had refusyd the said
presents. for couetyse to have had gretter. offered other unto her in more great
habundance than she had tofore / Promising to give him yet more of them.
asmoche as he would ask / And where she continued prayenge him yt his playsure
were to resceyue the said presents / And saw they were refusyd. And to her
sent again by the good Eugene / She ran in to a gretter hete than she was
before / And at this cause feynyng to be syke so grievously that she should
not have moeuyd herself out of her bed / Made saint Eugene to be prayed that
she should come and vysyte her. And she did so / And being there before the
bed of Melance that had made the folk to goo out of her chamber that were
there feynynge to declare unto her some secrets in confession. as well of her
conscience as of her sikenesse. Said unto Eugene such words / My lord and my
friend Eugene. pardonne if it playse you if I over famylyerly do declare my
pouertee unto you / For I am thereto constrained. by the great sore which
opressyth me / Certainly my lord the great and excessyue love which I have
conceived toward your gracious yongthe The right excellent beauty of the
which dame Nature has so greatly and largely endowed you. tormentith my pore
heart so sharply that it ne were to me possible never to have Joy ne playsure
in this world But if it come to me of you / So yield I myself and al my
goods to you alone. making and ordeynynge your goodly person lord and
master over my body. and of al my gods Alas my lord what playsure do ye take
totorment thus greuousli your body by folysshe and vain abstynences / I have
Infynyte possessions and riches. I have great tresours of gold and of silver /
I am enhau^sed in auctoryte of noblesse of my kin^e / and this year I have
lost my childern that are deceased out of this world / Alas I pray you
succeed to my goods instead of them / and be alone master and lord. not
oonly of me but also of all my possessions. and gods. The devout Eugene
hering thise foul words and dyshoneste exhortaco^ns / answerde to her in this
manner / O woman dampened certainly / thy name beryth truwitnesse of an horrible
cursidnes and treison / Truly you have made ready in the a great place for ye
devil / Da^pnable disceyuer leave yt will that you haste to torn the servants
of god / I woll well that you know that we relygiouses have well used to live
otherwise / The dampened spyrytes that are to ye like / take thy gods. and not
we that have no appetyte to them nor woll not have them / For it is unto us a
pleysau^t thing to beg our bread with our lord Ihu^ Christ / He is habu^dantly
rich that is with him O Melance the will of me is yt such folysshe
concupysce^ces depart from the Truly th^happynesse yt has assaylled the shall
not be cause of thy heel but of dampnaco^n / Thou that art made the house and
dwelling of the venymouse dragon. shedest and spredest a wonderful venym /
But by the calling of the name of god. and by ye help of his mercifulnes. we
have eschewed. and yet we shall eschew thinfecco^n of thin abhomynable and
horrible poisons / Then this cursyd and wretchyd woman / Impacyent of the
repreyffe ye the good Eugene had said to her / and at this cause al enswollen
with bitter d^^playsure / Knowing also that she had thus lost her honor /
And doubting that Eugene should tell her sin for to quench her feere.
purposyd herself to complain of him before the Justice Wherefore Incontinent
she went before the great Prouoste of Alexandrye: and showed to him in a great
wodnesse and hertly dysplaysure / How for to have found the means to be
helped of a sykenesse that have kept her long. she had suffered a young
relygyous of the Relygyon Christian. that called himself a good Leche. to come
toward her for to hele her / But this Relygyouse replenysshyd with treyson.
Wenynge that she had be such. as they were of whom he had taken of a custom
his foul delectacyons. hadd dare. all shame laid aside speak unto her
shameful and dishoneste words for to have moeued her unto his abhomynable
will / and that worse was / If she had not called her woman abowte her / He
should have rauysshyd her and defoyled / Requyrynge this Melance to the said
Prouoste that thereof he would do to her as right and reason requires / The
Prouoste heryng thise words. was enflammyd with great woodnesse. And sent to
the monastery certain Commyssaryes that charged were to bring him prysonere /
Eugene and all the other dwelling in the said monasterye Which thing was
done / And by cause they were in such nombre: that they might not be all in
one prison together / They were put in diverse places and under diverse kepers
fether^^ well hard and fast / The said P^^^oste after gyuyng credence
folysshly to the ^^^des of the said Melance. condemned them all for to deye.
and ordained a certain day yt some of them should be take for to be devoured
of wild bestes The other to be bren^ed and the other to be put unto diverse
torments / And at this cause was through all ye land great no ye of the
execucion that should be done of the said Relygyouses / The which all the
dwellers of the land Judged them worthy to suffer death / For they thought
that Melance which was come of a noble house / and of high kynreed / would
never have putt upon them without a Just cause such a charge / Fynably when
the day was come that the said execuco^n should be done. all the dwellers of
the towns and cytees lyenge abowte / came to Alexandrye the cite for to see
the same / Whereof some said their opinion in one manner. and the other said
otherwise / But our lord god that never leuyth his servants in their most
need / After that the hangman had made ready the torments and other things
couenable to putt to death Eugene and the other relygyouses. suffered that the
said Eugene for to declare the more openly her great virtues / was by the said
Prouostr questyoned / And for to make all the people wise of the great malice
of the foresaid wicked Melance / Then the said Prouoste named Philyp that was
fader to Eugene. and that knew her not. began to speak before her saying in
this wise / Come hither false Christian man and the worst of the other Has thy god
commanded to the to be oppressor and defoyler of the noble ladies. Thou art
well shamles and ouerseen / What folly causyth the to pray. and would have
take by folly so noble a lady as is dame Melance Eugene casted her sight to the
ground. and feryng to be know of her fader. answered mekeli / Mi god whom I
serve has commanded ye men shall keep his chastytee and vyrgynyte / and unto
all those that done so. he promysyth everlasting life. in his Joy of heaven /
And now we may declare Melance to be a liar. and forger of falshede / But it
is better that we suffer some euylles than that she should be atteyned and
conuycte of her sin. to the end yt we lose not the merit of our patience /
Always if you sire Provost woll promise when she shall be proved falls and full of
lesyng. yt ye shall do her no harm. at this hour we shall approve her syn^e /
ye Prouoste heryng her meke words granted her request / Then^e Eugene to
testyfie the untruth of Melance. required ye men should her woman servant in
her chamber do come / The Judge made all the servants of the said lady to be
called. and brought before him. which declared by their oaths that their lady
Melance with good and Just cause had complained her of the Relygyous Eugene /
And that he would have constrained her as it is said above / The Prouoste
herynge their deposicyons. said unto saint Eugene / What wol thou say now
false and wicked monk / thou see how thus many witness thy cursyd delight /
Eugene of this false wytnessyng was sore trowbled / So thout she in herself.
that if should hyde her virgynytee / So many Relygyouses as were there
prysonners with her. there should allisuffre death for her and in ye time to
come the evil and malycyous should be more bold to repreue the servants of
god / Of the other part she hadd purposed never to dyscouer her conuersaco^n.
but oonly to her spouse Ihu^ Christ / Nevertheless for to save ye life of her
relygyouses / and to the end that the cursed Melance. and al such other. by
falshed^ should not be in time coming so outrageous for to charge wrongfully
ye christian people / she thought to open and show her befall that was so
secret / So departed she her gown fro top to too. and showed that she was a
woman and namely that the Provost was her fader. and Claudia her mother / and
told him that Anitus and Sergius were her bredern / This came anon to ye
ceres of her mother Claudia that was in her place / Wherefore she desyryng to see
her daughter ran^e anon to the bars where the Justice was / And there ye
Prouoste. she and her bredern knew her / and began to weep and make great way
lynges. that long were to be rehercyd Anon were brought gowns of clothe of
gold unto her. of the which she clothed her as by force / After she showed to
her fader how Prothus and Iacintus his two Emiches and she had forsake the
world and all the goods in earth. and had made theymself Christian / Then all
together thanked god / saying / O god thy power is now gloryfyed. that has
overcome and banysshyd the enmyes of thy servants / Eugene was ladde in great
worship in to the house of her fader / And the fire of heaven came down upon
the house of Melance / In which abode no body alive. but were all that were
(...) in brenned and wasted all in to ashes / Then all the Christian people
that had be put out of the said Prouoste were called again / And the church was
open / the which by the space of eyghte year was shytte / The fader of Eugene
Prouoste of Alexandrye that in ye Christian hadd take away their fraunchyses.
restored them enteerly unto them again / And he himself through the enticynge
of his daughter Eugene made him to be crystned his wife also and all his
servants / All the cite was as it had be one oonly church. so much began
there the name of the Christian to flourysshe / Now it is truth / as often it
happyth. that the good are enuyed by the badde / that some went and reported
unto Severe and Anthony both emperors of the Romans / under the which / the
governance of all Alexandrye was ruled. and governed / How Phylyp the Provost
was become a christian man. and dystroyed thydolles and builded chyrches in the
name of ye god of the Christian / And how he hadd ordained new laws. and put
aside ye emperors laws / The which wrote unto him in this manner / Philyp we
be informed of the noueltees that thou have done in Alexandrye / And we know
well that our fader Com^odius ordened the to be there / Not oonly as Prouoste.
but as a king. In such wise yt in all thy life thou sholdest never be reuokyd
therfro / And no successor should not be given to the / Wherefore we desiring
some things to be multyplyed unto the benefices of the same order / We se^de
ye word of commandment that to the right mighty gods thou do make like
sacrefice. as we have acustomyd. or otherwise thou shall be by reuyd fro thy
dygnytee. And with this thy goods shall be unto us applied as forfayted / The
Prouoste Phylyppe when he herd these tidings. feyned himself to be syke. till
that he had caused al his goods to be dealed unto the poor for goddis sake /
and to the chyrches. And he himself weut and comforted the Crysten^ to the end
they should be more stable and constaunt. and not ferynge the death / During
the said time notwithstondyng that he was commanded to wythdrawe himself out
of the office of Prouoste / Nevertheless by cause none other was yet come that
should ocupye the said office. the people served and obeyed him as their
Prouoste / And over this the priests ordained him their Bysshopp / So was the
good Phylyppe a hole year well serving god in such astate / The year expyred
was ordained to the office of the Prouoste one named Perennius. which trowed
to have slain him / But by cause he was much agreeable to god and to the people
he cowde not find ye ways thereof / Finably he made to be put secretly some
subtle and evil dryuels that feyned to be Christian within the church where as
was the good Phylyppe. and slew him in doing the dyuyne service / These
unhappy Dreuels and murdrers were take and put in prison in the hondes of the
Prouoste Pere^nius / The which Prouoste felyng hy^ self gyltye of this sin /
And feynyng as he would have made them to be kept surely for to speak with
them. and inquire of the truth of the befall. made them to be putt in to
prison under good kepers / But nevertheless in few days after he let them goo
free by pardon and Indulgence of the princes Eugene that in the said cite had
begone a Couente of vyrgines. buried the body of her fader the martyr within ye
church. where she held her / Also her mother Claudia had begone an hospytall.
which she had endowed with suffysau^t rentes and fair possessions / for to
herbrugh the poor pilgrims. was at the buryenge of the said blessed martyr
sometime her husbonde When his service was done / Claudia mother to Eugene and
her children returned to Rome and they there lo come / one of the said children
was made Senator of Rome / ye other Consul of Cartage. and the other vycarye in
Affryque / Eugene had many cosyns both of men and of wymmen dwelling in
Rome that came to see her. desyryng at her ensample to be Christian Among other
saint Basille a vyrgyne / that was of the lygnage of kings cowde not fy^de the
means to speak with Eugene for to be Christian / So made she her to be prayed by
a messager. that she would send her some Instrucco^ns of the Christian faith
Then saint Eugene sent her two christian knights / Prothus and Iacintus
toward ye said Basylle. for to be by the^ taught in the faith of holy church
/ The which she received worshypfully as apostles of Ihu^ Christ / All day
and all night she was with them. spekinge of ye holy scripture / And by cause
they were Emyches. thereof followed no sklau^dre / In the said time one named
Cornille was pope of Rome / which came to her secretly and crystned her / Wha^
saint Basylle was co^fermyd in ye faith by the sacrament of baptesme / she
came almoost every night and visited saint Eugene. and all the wydowes yt were
cristned went to ye covent of saint Claude the mother of Eugene and the virgyns
resorted to saint Eugene / The said saint Cornyll at yt time pope. went every
Saturday and visyted them / expownyg unto them devout ympnes and so^ges all
ye long night unto ye spring of the day / Valerien and Galien in tho days
were emperors yt which began to have ye Christian in great Indignacyon for by
cause ye saint Cyprien co^uerred them of Cartage / and saint Cornylle the
Romans / So was sent Paternus Proconsul in to Cartage for to bring the^^ to
death Cyprien yt which thing he did ^ by all thus he deyed a martyr The same
time saint Eugene knew by the will of god / yt saint Basylle should be mart^ed
for to keep her vyrgynyte. the which reuelaco^n she gave her to know and saint
Basylle answered to Eugene^ yt also she had understand by reuelaco^n of god yt
Eugene should have a dowble crown of martyrdom. one for ye merit yt she had

for to keep her faith. Then^e saint Eugene yielded graces to god saying / O my
god. only sone of ye euerlastyg god the fader. yt art come in to this vile
world within the womb of ye right holy virgin. I byse^he ye right humbly. yt
it woll playse yt to grant unto although virgins. which yt have committed to
be ruled by me. ye grace yt they may come to thy everlasting Joy / Eugene
after went with her vyrgyns. and said to them such or like words in
substance / My sisters ye vyneyerde is now ripe / and the seeson is now come
yt the good vynes shall be pressed out of the grapes with fete / but after yt
the vine shall be strayned and made well pure and clean / It shall be presented
for to be drunk in the ryall court of the king / And therefore said god I am
the vine. And ye my dyscyples are the raysyns / My systers yt are sprynges and
reysyns of virgynytee be ever ready for to make fair and worshypp ye law
which ye hold. Virgynyte is the first showing of good virtues. nyhe neighbor
to god like unto angels. mother of life friend unto holiness way of suretee lady
of Joy. leder of virtue. nourysshinge and crown of faith the socours and
yelder of charity And therefore my systers we ought to desire none other thing
somoche. as to live in vyrgynyte / and yet no^e great deuoco^n we ought to
have. as to deye for her in this byhalfe / Ye know yt all erthly things come
with great Ioye^ but after departing they are cause of great heaviness and so
they give a laughter and a Joy sondayn for to be the cause^ of weeping
euerlasty^gly / For this life is but a momente to the regard of the life yt
evermore shall last / And at the end al those yt thereupon shall set their
affection and love shall fall in to everlasting da^pnaco^n / Then^e my
douters sith yt ye have abyden with me hitherto have in you consta^ce and
perseuerau^ce unto the last end / Weep in this world to ye intent yt ye shall
have everlasting Joy Now I beseech ye holy ghost that he will keep you / and I
bileue he shall preserve you in your vyrgynytee / Desire not my bodyly presence
/ but if I have done any good works. follow me ghostly / After yt she had thus
preched and exhorted them to remember the heavenly things for to flee the

Then^e Eugene and saint basylle departed fro them That same day one of the
wym^en servant with saint Basylle forsayde went toward Po^pee. yt which had
trouthplyght this holy Basille. and showed unto him. that she and her uncle
Helain were become cirsten. and that he should never wedde her. bisyde this she
said to him yt she had with her.ii. Emiches. yt is to wit. Prothus and Iacintus.
yt which Eugene had sent to her for to torn her to the christian faith And
how she served them as gods Inmortall in kissing daily their fete Pompee as
affrayed went toward Helayn yt was uncle and governor of saint Basylle / and
said to hy^ / Wit it Helayn yt now I woll make my wedding and therefore show me
Basylle. which is yeuen to me by the emperor and all the Romayn princes /
Helayn answerde / My friend I have nourisshed her during ye time of her yong^^
/ For at ye time she was in my kepy^ge for the love of her fader that was in
kin^esman / I have done for her all yt was in me possible. but nevertheless she
is out of my rule and has her free choy^ / and therefore if you woll speak with
her goo to her house / Then^ was Pompee more angry than before. and went an^e to
her house / So commanded he ye P^^ters yt they should goo tell Basylle their
maystresse yt he would speak with her / The good lady sent him word again yt
she would another see him nor mete with him / and therefore he might well goo
home again / Po^pee was fulfilled with wrath more than he was before. and through
the favor of all ye Senatours^ cam^ tofore themperours. and said unto them /
O emperors right holy socour at this hour your subgets Romayn. and put from
this noble cytee of Rome the new gods yt Eugene has brought in it. coming
out of the land of Egypt / It is long sith yt the Christian are lettynge the
common we will. For they done done other thing. but only mock with the holy
ceremonies of our law / They dispyse our gods right myty. saying yt they
ben ydoles. rauysshy^ge deuyls / They change the right of nature / they break
marriage. and wythdrawe unto them the young daughters In saying yt it is a
dangerous thing yt a bird shall take her spouse by wedlock / What shall we
do noble emperors / by whom shall the Romans be honored. and also the
ky^ges subdued / if the wy^men yt we ought to have to be our wives be take
away from us. by whom we might have issue. to whom we might command / Where
shall then be the reparaco^n of the strengthes of the Romans for ye
contynuau^ce of batayles / When Pompee had made an end of his words. all the
Senators began to weep over saint Basylle. And that notwytstondynge Galien the
emperor Judged Incontinent yt she should take Pompee to her lord and husbonde
/ Or else by wepen he should make her life to be brought at an end / And in
like wise Eugene. but if she would do sacrefyce unto the gods / And beside
this he ordened great punysshme^t to be take through all the cite upon tho that
should hyde by any manner the christian people And after a messager was sent to
saint Basylle / that commanded her in the emperor Galiens byhalfe. that she
should come speak with him. or else that she should take Pompee to her husbonde
/ The good vyrgin answerde that she would not / And her spowse should be Ihu^
Christ the sone of the everlasting god and none other / In saying the which
words the messager percyd through and through the body. and slew her / After he

the gods / And as they cam^ thither ^ were making their prayers to Ihu^
Christ. thyd^lle of Iupyter that was in ye temple was smyten to many small
pyeces / Nicecius that was ye time Prouoste of Rome made them to be byheded at
the fete of saint Basylle notwythstondynge that she was deed / After that he
sent for saint Eugene and asked how by her art magyk she had converted so great
people / The good lady bold and steadfast in the faith / answerde holdly saying
^yn art is not magyke But my believe is in that self god that has a fader
without mother and a mother without fader / And the which fader has engendered
hy^ with out mother / And she in like wise conceived him without knowledge of
man / My god and my master has a wife a vyrgyn. which engenders a
contynuell multitude of children / His flesh is Joined to the flesh of his
wife a virgin^ Without lettyng there kiss each other. they shall be everlasting
in love / And so are they so perfyte. yt al virgynyte. all charity. and all
on^lynes of body is there kept / Nicecius Prouoste romayne dredynge ye
the emperor should here her speak / for he doubted much leest he should be
turned to the christian faith by her wordes^ Incontinent made her to be brought
in to the temple of ye goddess Diana. for to do sacrefyce to the said
goddess. or else to suffer death The good ladi Eugene put herself on both
her knees. and heuynge her hondes toward heaven said / O my god ye know the
secrets of my conscience / yt have kept my vyrgynyte by thy l^ue yt haste
given to me thy blessed sone to my spouse. yt has made to regne in me the holy
ghost. I pray yt now that you wolte be with me presently. for to help me
confess thy holy name. to the end yt all thoos yt worship this ydoll may be
co^fou^ded with their sacrefyces / and anon all the temple fell down / and
was al together broken. except the awter before the which saint Eugene was
knelynge / And these things were done in the isle of Lych^anye in presence of a
great multitude of people that there was come for to see the end of saint Basylle
Some began to call and cry layenge yt she was Innocent. and ^other called her
Magycyen All this befall was showed to the Prouoste. which made it to be
known unto the emperor / The which commanded yt she should be cast in to

as soon as she was cast in ye great ^^^me. ye stone claue all in pieces. and
the g^od lady was seen walk upon the wa^^. to the end that the Christian should

where she was thus kept. was seen a great light so bryghte. that al was

his servants came and vysited her. and brought her a loof of bread. as white
as the snow / and said unto her / Eugene my true spouse and friend take the

Here folowyth of saint Basille bishop of Capadoxe / And begynnyth in latin

Saint Basyll among the other of his time showed in earth as well by works.
as by words a life couenable. ordeynynge and dysposyng his said life by
ghostly wysdom / He gaaf unto Ihu^ Christ his body and his soul. putting
hy^self to diverse dau^geours and perils for the faith of our lord. and
repreuynge many errors which he overcame and brought down. In his seventh
year of aege / he was of his friends set to scole. where he was abidynge the
space of.v. year / During the which time. he almost knew all Philosophye.
After he departed out of Capadoce his naturell country / and went to the
cytee of Athenes. that then^e was mother of all scyences / and there chastely
heued with a Doctor named Eubole / Whereby he had the very knowledge of all
scyences / For he studied full besyly with many excellent men / Gregory the
great yt after the said time was pope of Rome by the space of.xii. year. In
lain also and Lybanyen. they.iii. were discyples of the said saint Basylle / He
made a promise unto god yt he should never ete bread nor drink wine till yt he
should have by the suffrau^ce of god know the secrets of ghostly wysdom
During the time of.xv. year yt he studied in Athenes / He knew all
Ppylosophye. after the enformyng of ye Greeks / And fynably he was right
expert in the science of Astrologye. and other after lyberall / But yet he had
not learned the very wysdom. by the which folk learn to know their Creator /
So it happed on a night as he studied / yt he was Inspyred with the holy
ghost / and purposed to know the holy scryptures / Wherefore he departed out of
Athenes. and went in to Egypt. In which lord / entering the hons of a
devout bysshopp named Porphyre. ye ladde a life much solytary / He required
hy^ mekely yt he would common with him in the books of the holy scryptures. and
dyuyne techynges / The which ye said Porphire took him unto him / and there he
studied by an hoole year. taking a great delight and playsure in ye said holy
scryptures / and ete none other mete but herbs and drank water / After he
axed of the said Porphire leave for to goo in pylgrimage to Ihrl'm. as well for
to god worshypp the holy places. as for to know ye great miracles yt were done
there. to the end he should come to a more knowledge of the faith / Porphyre
seenge his devout affecco^n gave hy^ leave / and recommended him to the grace
of god / And when he had done his pilgrimage / he returned to Athenes where he
had studied a long season before / He bey^ge there among the grekysshe
Philosophers. he spoke ever to them of the holy scriptures / and exorted the
mysbileuyd to believe in Ihu^ Christ / showing unto them the way of health /
and namely hau^ted gladli and hourly with his master Eubole / And by cause he
desired to reward hy^ of the good that he had done to him in his chyldhode /
he would serve him in the faith of Christ So sought he him for this cause in
all places where men dysputed / and did somoche yt he fond hy^ in the
subarbes of Athenes. disputyng with ye other philosophers / Saint Basylle
herynge his master. that proposed a conclusion falls. rebuked him of it /
Whereof many at them present were somewhat abashed. and asked what he was that
so b^^ly rebukyd Eubole / Whereat himself answered yt it was god. or else
Basille Then^e knowing yt it was he. leuy^ge all the Pphilosophers. came to
him and made to each other a glad knowledge / Three days they were together
dysputy^g of diverse matters / Eubole yt had be master to Basylle. apposed hy^
of the dyffynyco^n of Phylosophie / and he answerde th^^t his first
dyffynyco^n was medytaco^n contynuell upon death / After he asked him. what was
of ye world / and he answerde yt it was the same yt was upon the world / The
words of the world are sweet. notwithstondyng yt it shall be full bitter to
him yt shall live in it vyciously / But who that wol be in ye world. may not
obey his sensualytee. and serve god / By cause yt none shall not serve well
two lords. And yt the naturell and manly desires are contrary to ye saluaco^n
of our souls / And therefore my master and co^maunder said saint Basylle / I
pray the let us quycken our spirytes. yt ben deed by sy^nes / And for to
purchase life euerlasty^ge let us follow the techynges of thapostles of ye
souerayn god Redemer of all the world / If we woll put pain to obey him
notwythstondynge yt we ben all ready stryken in aege. Yet shall we have asmoche
of reward by medyaco^n of his grace. as they yt have be in his service from
the time of their yongthe / For it is written in the gospel yt as great a
reward had he that came at the hour of Sexte. as he ye was com^ at the hour of
Prime / The doctor Eubole herynge the warnynges of his dyscyple Basylle. began
to say / O Basylle. true shewer and expownar of yt faith of Criste. through
the. I believe in one god almighty. In time past that I knew. I did show the.
and now all yt is mine I give unto the. and putt in thy possesso^n purposyng
to lead with the you remenau^te of my life / and if it playse to my god Ihu^
Christ. I shall receive wtin short time the holy sacrament of baptym / Saint
Basylle answerde. O my master. blessed be our god yt has mekely lyghtned the

you were overthrown. through the vayn and worldly science^ and yt now you know
his mercy. Sith yt thou woll be with me^ I shall teache the how we shall live in
getynge our we will and in delyueryng ourself from the letty^ges of this wretched
world / First we shall selle all yt we have. and shall give it to the poor
nedy for goddys sake. and after we shall goo to the holy cytee of Iherusalem /
The which thing they did / And clothyd theymself in Raymentes like Christian
people / for to receive Crystendom / And in going thither they turned many

Then when saint Basylle and his doctor Eubole were come in Ih^l'm. they

devoutly yt he would vouchesauf to show some token to them of his grace After
he rose up and took of al his clothes for to enter within the flood. and then^e
ye said bishop went and crystned him / At which crystnynge a much
merueylous thing happed there / For a great light as it had be fire making
wonderful shinyng came from heaven upon them / and out of ye fire flewe out a
white dove / ye which after she had trowbled ye water flewe again in to heaven /
Of which thing those present were much merueyled For they had never seen so
quycke ne so great a light / So began they to praise and glorifye the name
of god. and pry^cipally the bishop ye contynuelly remembered the love yt saint
Basylle had to the Redemer of the world. They.ii. then^e together crystened and
enoynted with the holy oil. returned to Ihrl'm. and there they dwelled a year

him yt he would give him the gift of understanding by the which he might to
the exaltaco^n of the faith and his glorious name make a service or office to
him agreeable in making unto him oblacyon of his precious blood / And yt in
this dooyng he might receive the grace of the holy ghost The good Basylle
after this request was by the space of six days as al changed and wythdrawe
fro his thought / But nevertheless he purposed to make ye said service / And on
a night after the said days paste / he had a syghte of god. the which
acompanyed of all his apostles. as when he wrote ye words that priests
proferon upon the breed. said to him / Basylle after thy desire be thy mouth
fulfyllyd of praysynge. to the end that by thy own word thou make sacrefyce
unto me of my blood / Saint Basylle yt could not abide the sight departed with
great fere. and went to the awter where he began to say and write this yt here
folowyth / Be my mouth fulfilled with loeuynge. to the end yt it sing ympne to
thy Joy / With this he made many other orysons that been customably said when
the body of our lord is to be consecrate of the priest / the which are not to
be written to any lay folk / Nor to be had in comynicaco^n but only among
men of ye church / And after the consecraco^n and eleuaco^n of the host.
which was of bread. he divided it in three parts / of the which he vsyd the
one in great dread and reverence. the other he kept for to bear with him / and
the third he kept for to be putt in to a down of fine gold. the which he
had do make for to be hanged over ye awter. in by tokenyng of that same down
that appeared over him when he was crystned in the flum Jordan / Eubole and man^
other clerks were then before the gate of the temple: and beholdinge this
mystery. they saw abowte him a wonderful light. which constrained them to
fall to ye ground / And with this they saw a great multitude of men. al
clothed in which rayments / the which aco^pamed him in making the said
sacrefyce The mass done saint Basyll gooyng out of the church / al them
present worshipped him. and putting before hy^ their knees to the ground made
him more great honor than they had be acustomyd / And at this cause he asked
them what it was yt had moeued them to come there. and also the cause why
they made him so great honor / Then they told him the wonderful syghte
that they had seen / of the which saint Basylle yielded graces to god / And
certain days after he gadred all ye people / In the presence of whom he put
the one of the said three parts of the host in to ye said douune of gold. and
hanged it reverently over the awter / And this done. He for to comfort the
people. and to conferme in the holy faith of Ihesu Christ. made a much fair

Then the folisshe lover answerde to the said Magicyen / That he was ready to

lover / and said to him / That at a certain hour of the night / he should
goo and put himself upon the graves of the Paynyms and Heretykes / And that
there he should hold up his letter in the air. And anon certain messengers
should come to him. which should bring him to the devil / Thus did this
unhappy wretch / And suddenly came to him a great multitude of wicked spirytes
from the prince of derkenesse. and of wyckydnesse. The which in great Joy
ladde him tofore their prince / Which was set up on hihe in a great chayer /
And about him were a great multitude of deuylles without nombre / In presence
of whom he presented his writing / And after that it was radde / the said
prince said unto him / Now come hither my friend / Do thou believe in me /
He answered ye / Yet again questyoned him saying / Do thou forsake Ihesu

shall do thy will to be performed and fulfilled to thy behouf and playsure /
Thou must first give to me a letter of thine hand / By the which thou shall
deny and forsake the sacrament of baptesme. and the christian faith / Secondly
thou shall promise me that thou shall serve me in this world And at the day
of dome thou shalt hold me felishyp. for to be with me afterward perpetuelly
in all the torments that I suffer / This unhappy man promised him all the same

The fader began to weep saying Alas what is fall to the my daughter. What is

understand showed unto him the great mercy of god. and how he is ever ready to
receive mekely our penance / The good daughter knelyd before the said saint
Basylle. and said to him O thou servant of god have mercy of our sin / The
holy man inquired of the said husbonde. if he had any hope to be sauyd. Whereat
he answerde that ye / This herynge. he brought them in to a secret place
within the church And during three days. he kept him there in contynuell
prayers. And often times both day and night he came. and vysyted him / And
asked him how it was with him. And he answered always that he had none hope
more of life / by cause of the cryenges and callynges that the deuelles made
daily and nyghtly abowte him / Which showed unto him the writing yt he had
made upon his promise to the prince of hell / Saying unto him Goo unhappy
man. thou art come unto us / And not we to the / What we neste thou for to do
/ The holy man comforted him. and moeuyd and styred him in saying to him /
That he should ever have steadfast faith and good hope in god. He gave him a
little mete / And blessed him with the sign of the Cross / And after he made
him to entree in his place where he was before / When he had been there ^i
the space of forty days / The holy man came to him / And examyned him how he
did / He answered that he was in good suretee / For that night he had seen
the said saint Basylle. that bataylled for him against the deuylles / And that
he had ouercomen them / Then the holy man brought him straight to his
chamber where his slepynge place was / And the next day by the morning. he
gadred together all the Clergy. and other folk of devotion / To whom saint
Basylle declared and showed this that folowyth / My children ye know that I am
your Pastor / And that I must yield acompte of your souls / I hadd lost a
sheep / The which god has sent again to me / And by cause that the good
Pastor for to quyte his conscience ought to pray contynuelly for his sheep /
I enjoin and command you yt ye both day and night be with me for to pray
god. to the end yt this sheep so come again to me may purchase his saluaco^n /
So began they al togider to pray god. with weeping and syngyng) Kyrieleyson
(After the good pastor took the poor man by the hand. and brought him in to
the church / The devil unto whom he had done ho^mage. and all his company.
came to ye assemble / trowynge to have take the poor syn^ar out of the holy
bishops hondes / and so began he to cry with an horrible voice. saying / O
thou holy man of god help me / Then^e saint Basylle turned his words unto the
devil and said to hy^ What ask thou ye devil dampened. and the worste of
all other wicked tendes / It suffyseth the not that thyself and all the
company be dampened. but art abowte full belie through your cursed temptaco^ns
for to make the pore creatures of god to false with you in hell / The devil
answerde / Basylle ye do me w^^ge to my great harm / for I and my fellows
here well the voices of them ye sing Kyncleyson / Saint Basylle answered / God
does this to thy harm and not I / The devil yet again said to him / Basylle
thou do me great wrong / for this synnar is come to me. and not I to him /
He has forsake his Creator in my presence / and thereof he has give to me his
writynge with his hand written. for a witness of the same / the which writing
I goo present before the euerlasty^g Judge / Saint Basylle then^e said to ye
devil / Blessed be god / My people shall never cease to pray / nor shall not
bring down their hondes. which are heued upward to heaven till that thou
haste given again the said writing unto this poor synnar / All this noble
assemble made after more deuowte prayers. than before had done / And ceased not
till that the said writing was taken in to the hondes of ye said holy man /
The which after the receyuynge of it. he yielded graces unto god / And said to
the syn^a^ before all ye people yt was there / My brother know not thou this
letter / He answerde ye / And that it was written with his own hand / Then^e
saint Basille brake it in pieces. and brought him to the church for to make
Confession / Which thing done. he Received his Creator / And after sente-hym
home again unto his his wife / The which of his great grace she thanked
deuowtly our lord /



Of a woman to whom her sin^es were forgyuen by the prayer of saint Basylle /
And begyn^yth in latin Mulier quida^. etc. Caplm.C.lxiiii.
A Woman rich and noble full of the vanitees of the world^ used evil of her
facultees / For she was prodyge and lecherous / So that in all manner of her
deeds she was vnagreable to god / And as a sow does lay herself in a foul
putdel. so was this woman wrapped in all fylthe and uncleaness of flesh And
sometime by a sy^guler grace that god gaaf her. she alone to herself made
knowledge of the great multitude of her sins. and in weeping said to god /
Alas my Redemer I that am a poor synnar. how shall I make satysfacco^n
toward the of my sins / I ought for to be the temple of the holy ghost /
And by my sins I have defoylled and hurt my soul / I am the most unhappy
of all the world / and I believe not that ever any woman syn her Crystendom
did so syn^e gretely / and so abhomynable as I have done Alack how shall I
mow be in certain that god woll receive my penance And when she had well
bethoughte herself upon her byfall / God Inspyred her to thy^ke upon the great
euylles and sins that she had sinned and done syn her yongthe unto her old
aege. And them she brought in mind. and wrote in a roll / And this done /
she sealed them under leed / And after purposed when saint Basylle should come
to the church for to sy^ge mass that she should deliver he Roll unto him /
The which thing she did so in cryenge wych an high voys / O holy man and
seruau^te of god have pity of me most wretched of all other synnars / Saint
Basylle asked her the cause of her wayllynge / and she answered / Alas my lord
I have written in this Roll all my misdeeds and wyckydnesse / I byseche the
that thou wolt not look upon them / But vouchesauf to do so much for me by
thy prayers toward god / That they may be forgyuen to me / I wot well that he
that has given me understanding and will for to know them / shall enhaunse
the prayer that thou shall make for me in this byfalfe / Therefore I byseche the
socour me now at my great need / The holy man took the roll of her / And heued
his hondes up toward heaven saying / O my god it aperteynyth thy dygnytee. for
to do that this poor sinful woman askith / thou may putt and enrase out
within a moment all the sins of the world / I byseche the mekely for her /
All our sins are in a certain nombre before thy mageste / But thy mercy is
without end / His prayer thus done / he set the Roll upon the awter / And
there the holy man abode. prayenge god a day and a night contynuelly / The
next morrow he called unto him the said woman in presence of some clerks. and
said to her / Woman thou know well yt thy sin can not be pardonned^ but by
the power of god the which answerde / Holy fader I by leave that yt thou say
/ And therefore I by seche mekely that it woll playse the to be mine helper
toward him. Then^e the roll was opened. and at opening of it^ It was found
that all her sins were to her foryeuen. except do great syn^e. which was not
enrased nor putt out. The pore woman was sore heavy. and dysco^forted. and
fell to the fete of ye holy man and cried / O man of god have pite upon me.
and like as thou haste prayed for all my synes. Yet again pray for me toward
god that this syn^e may be also pardon^ed to me / Saint Basylle began to weep
and said to the woman / My friend stand up. I have as great need of pardon^e
as thiself / For I am a syn^er / He yt has put out thyn other sy^nes may emase
the same which is left behind / And therefore if in time coming you keep the
commandments of god He shall not only forgive the this live / But wythall he
shall give the ye life eternal in everlasting bliss / Thou shall goo in to the
Hermytage. where a man is named Effrem. to whom thou shall take thy roll. And
Ie^^st in god yt by his prayers thou shall be delyuerd of the same sin and
shall have of it a full absoluco^n. to the saluaco^n of thy soul / The woman
walked solonge through the wilderness yt she fond the holy man Effrem So
begane she to knock at his do^e cryenge O holy man of god have pite of me /
Effrem yt by the knowledge of god. knew the cause why she was come. answerde
unto her / Woman goo thou the way for I am a synnar as ye art / Whereby I have
need of ye mercy of god as you have / The woman then^e cast to him her roll
saying / O holy fader the bishop Basylle sends me to the. gyuynge to me a
hope. yt through thy prayers the greetest of my sins shall be foryeuen unto me
Effrem said unto her / Nay my daughter nay / He that by his prayers has
got remyssyon of thin other sins may yet do yt the same syn^e for yt which
thou come toward me shall be pardon^ed unto the / Torn again lightly toward
him. to the end yt thou may speak with him before his death / The woman
returned anon / But wha^ she entered in Cezaree the cite. she met the corpse of
saint Basille yt men brought to his grave / Then she made great cryenges
saying / Ha poor unhappy what shall thou do now / O holy man of god. whi haste
you sent me to the holy fader Effrem. syn yt thou might get remyssyon of my
sin / I believe it was by cause I should not give the man lettyng at thy death
/ The poor synful woman laid her roll upon the corpse of the holy man / The
which thing known of one of the prestes that was at the buryenge of him he
would see and read ye same roll / And opened it in deed / But he fond no
thing written therein / Then^e he said unto the woman / O woman what desyrest
thou Thy roll is without any scripture Thou knew not the Indulgence that god
had done to the / All the people seenge this miracle. began to thank god that
has given might to ye quirke. to enrase and put out by pardonne the sins
fulfilled and done by ye wretchyd synnars /

Of Joseph the Hebrewe / Which Hystorye is ann dexed to the said chapter /
Joseph the Hebrewe was some time a leche well expert in the craft of Physike.
and so sure yt in tastynge the poulse of what someuer person. he wyste to
say.iiii. or.v. days before the decesse of the syke the very hour that he
should pass out of this world / And by the great experyence that he had in
medycyne / He was sore enuyed of the other leches / But saint Basylle that
knew by reuelacyon of god / that in time coming he should be regenered by the
holy sacrament of baptym loved him much / And often comyned with him /
desiring him to forsake his error. and to torn him to yt faith of crystendom
/ The which Joseph answerde to him upon the same / that he should deye in the
faith where he was borne in / Saint Basylle replied against his answer saying
/ Joseph believe that I shall tell the / Certainly I ensure the that without
the sacrament of baptym / another thyself nor I shall not come in paradys. Have
not thyn elder faders ben baptized / Know thou not that for our redempco^n
Jesus Christ has take our nature in the womb of the vyrgyn Mary / And for
that self Redempco^n he was crucyfyed and brought to death / And soon after
he rose from death to life / and now he sytteth at the right hand of his fader
/ And at the end he shall come to Judge and yield unto every one after yt he
has deseruyd / Then it is Impossyble without regeneraco^n of ye water and of
the holy ghost / and also without the co^munyon of the sacrament of the awter.
that we shall be sauyd / But what soever exortacion yt the holy man made unto
Joseph / he would take no head to his words / It happed so ye god / which
would call unto him the good saint Basylle. made him know the hour of his
death. by reuelacyon of god / And then^e he sent for Joseph ye leche forsayde.
for to Judge the hour of his death / Joseph after that he had tasted the vein
of saint Basyll said to his servants. that they should make ready his wyndynge
shete for to burye hy^ wythall / and that he cowde not live long / Saint
Basylle that understood this Judgment. asked him how he knew it / Whereunto he
answerde. that he knew it certay^ly by the feeling of his vein / The holy man
said unto hy^ My friend thou wo^est not what thou say / Joseph answerde to
him / this day shall the son goo with the son^e The holy man said unto him.
And if I dey not till to morrow in the morning what shall thou say / He
answered. that it was not possible / And that with great pain he should live
yet an hour / And therefore he told him that he should dyspose of his
business and of his church / For he should deye before that the day should
faylle / Saint Basylle said to him / Now come hither leche / What shall thou
say if I live unto to morrow six of the clock / He answered to him. That he
should then deye with him / Saint Basylle said unto him / At leest if thou
wolt deye take before the ^he faith of Ihesu Criste. and the sacrament of
baptesme / Then Joseph promised him / that if he lived as long as he had
said / Without any manner delay / he should be obeyssaunte to his will /
Then the holy man made his prayer unto god / to the end yt he would length
his days. only for to torn Joseph the Ebrewe to the faith / The which
request god granted to him And in the morning next he sent for the said
leche / the which wening that he had be deed. came Incontinent to his
lodging / But when he saw yt he was yet alive. he fell down at his fete.
and cried him mercy / Saying yt there was no god so great. as the god of the
Crystens / And then^e he forsook the law of the Jews. and took the christian
faith / Desyryng saint Basille that he and all his meyne might be crystned /
The holy man said unto him / that he should christian them hymselfe^ And then
the good leche Joseph took him again by the hand / and towchyd the vain of his
right arm / And after that he had felt it. he said unto him / My lord thy
nature is febled and weary that thou should not conne goo to the church / The
holy man answered unto him / We have our god which is creator of nature. the
which reco^fortyth us / And how he it that ye holy man had no naturell
strength. yet went he to the church. in which ye said Joseph his company and
Servants were Incontinent cristenyd / And after the said saint Basylle
brought the said Joseph unto his Do^tour / and there was yeuen unto him a
spyrytuell fo^e. in rehercyng unto him the Joys of heaven / Sone after the holy
man dyssposyd himself for to sing mass / And after that it was done. he
kyssed all the Pryncypall of the church and the lords of the town / Unto
whom he Recommended right besyly Joseph the new Christian / After he went
again to his house / In which yeldinge graces and thanks unto god. betoke
his soul in to his hondes / When the good Joseph in his science had well
considered the death of the said saint Basylle. he said / Truly holy fader
Basyll / If thou hadd would. thou sholdest not as yet have deyed / And this he
said. by cause that he knew well that he had lived long over naturell
possybylytee. The next day with great honor was his body buried within the
church / Gregory that for that time was bysshopp of Nazance. when he wyste
that saint Basylle was discessed / He came to his Te^ment and laid himself
down over his body. making upon it great lamentacyons / And nevertheless he
cried to the people with a high voys / O people rejoice now yourselfe and make
orysons unto god / Syngyng ympnes and psalms / And cease not to make
remembrance of the holy man Basylle / Morouer after the coming of the said
bysshopp. came there twelve other the which together laid the holy corpse in to

Here folowyth of the holy fader Effrem / And begynnyth in latin Fratres
ena^racionem volo facere / and cetera Caplm.C.lxv.


Saint Iherom makith menco^n in ye last chapter of ye first part of the life
of faders of ye holy Heremyte Effrem yt. was unknow of saint Basylle And of
the which Effrem saint Iherom says to have had knowledge by telling unto hy^
made of certain faders / And for to show thereof. It is truth yt the said
Effrem was borne of Syrie / He being in his hermitage a friend of his showed
unto him ye perfyte astate of saint Basylle And for to have of it some
experyence. he prayed god right hertely yt it would playse him to give him by
reuelaco^n some knowledge of the holiness of saint Basylle / Our lord that
herd his prayer made to him such a reuelaco^n That is to wit that he being
as half a sleep and half waking. he saw a pyller of fire which was so long
yt it retchyd to the heaven / And in seenge the same. he herd a voys that said
to him Effrem Effrem. such as thou seeste this pyller. such is Basylle /
Then went he in to the church of Cezaree in Capadoce. where the said saint
Basyll was upon a day that men made solempnytee of Epiphanye / And by cause
that he understood no Greek. he took an expowner with him. to whom he said
when he saw saint Basylle ordained in so great honor / We have lost our
pain / For this Basylle is not such as I have seen him / The same time saint
Basylle was clothio in such ornaments. acompanyed of many clerks / So was
Effrem angry in himself / Saying we Heremytes endure both cold and heete in
the wilderness. and have no reward / And this Basylle here which is in
honor proferred is a pyller of fire / And as he was in this malencoly. saint
Basylle sent to the holy fader Effrem one of his Archedeakens for to tell him
that he should come. for to speak with him / The Archedeaken came to the said
holy fader Effrem. and to him he said / Thy fader Archebisshopp of Cezaree
sendyth the word that thou come speak to him / Effrem answerde to him / My
friend it is not to us that thou should speak / We ben not they that he would
have / For we ben Strangers The Archedeaken reported this answer to saint
Basylle. which sent hy^ again to saint Effrem^ and charged him to do his
message in this wise / Sire Effrem I command the to come to thy archebisshop
/ Effrem was much merueyled. and gloryfyeng the name of god answerde to
tharchedeaken / Truly Basylle it is a very pyller of fire / For the holy ghost
spekyth by his mouth / They never had seen each other. but in spirit Fynably
ye service ended Effrem came to saint Basylle / and then^e they made the one to
the other devout salutaco^ns Saint Basyll greted him in this manner / O fader of
holy Heremytes thou art welcome / you that haste multeplyed the dyscyples of
Ihu^ Christ you art welcom^ Alas good fader thou haste much pain. in coming
hither for to see a poor sy^ner. god yield the mede after thy labor / Effrem
answered to him / and to the holy fader all yt thy heart desires / After he
received his maker of ye hondes of saint Basylle / And when they had be long
together. Effrem prayed saint Basylle that he would grant to him a request /
Saint Basylle said unto him / Command me. and say what you wol For I am
gretely bound unto the forth traueyle that you haste take for to vysyte me /
Effrem said unto him. I know that all yt thou shall ask of god shall be of him
granted unto the gladly / For it is written that god does fulfill the will of
those yt dread him. and shall enhau^ce their prayers / Therefore I biseche ye
that you wolt pray him that he woll give me that grace. yt I may speak Greek /
Saint Basylle consented unto his request. saying yt it was honest / Then^e
they set theymselfe to prayer. and were so long enough / And this done saint
Basille rose up. asky^g to saint Effrem why he made not himself to be promoted
to the order of prestehode. sith that he was worthy to be a priest / Whereat he
answerde. yt he deferred to do the same. taking hy^self vnworthi thereunto. by
cause he was to great a syn^ar / Saint Basille answered unto him / After my
mind. would god thy sins were mine. Yet again they kneled on their knees to ye
ground / and anon ye tongue of the holy fader Effrem was enfourmed to speak
grekysshe langage and redily began to speak it. as he had be born in the mids
of Greece / They yeldes graces and thanks to god therefore in loouynge and
praysynge his glorious name / And after they were three days together / During
the which space. he that Effrem had brought with him. for to be his Expownar
of Greek langage unto his mother la^gage. was made deaken / And the holy fader
Effrem also ordened in the order of preesthode / And after they commanded each
other unto god yeuynge thanks unto him of that they had seeen each other /

HEre ends the first part of the life of Faders. and after folowyth the
second part /
Sequitur secunda pars
Here follows the second part.
Here follows the second part of the life of holy faders of Egypt
co^teynyng in diverse books many laudable exhortacyons for to enduce all
persons / pryncypally men of Relygyon to live solytaryly and well with some
fair hystoryes excytyng to flee vices and ensyewe virtues / as more largely is
declared in the table I set at the beginning of this present book where ye
chapytres ben declared all a long / as well thoos that are contained in the
precedent and first part as in this second / and in the third and fourth
parts consequently following / and all together translated from Latin in to
Frensshe out of the books that thereof have be made by the right deuote and
approved doctor in holy church saint Jerome. And first the prologue
begins in latin Vere mundu^ etc.

WHat is he that doubts / but that the world is kept and preserved by the
merit of saints / and among other by thoos of whom the life is written in
this presence volume / the which have fled all concupyscence and in all have
forsaken the world. Reputing as for naught all that is in it. And for to
withdraw therfrom fully their affeccyons and them to turn unto god would
enhabyte and dwell in wodes deserte. Some in ^aues / and other in roches and
high montayns / without to have had any care or business of their mete or
of their drink. And as having their oonly co^fydence in the medefulnes of god
/ they have gone without silver / without bread and without any other mete in
to solytary places where as no person hau^ted nor no goods grew there but
herbs and wild fruit. O thing wou^derfull. They never had honger ne thurst
but have be sustained and fed oonly of the grace and mercy of our lord. So
ought we well to love our god when his will is that through their merytes we may
be assuaged of our euylles by their supplycacyons whereby we obtain the
remyssyon of our sins. Ye that read this present book take no head to the
langage rude and ill ornated / but oonly to the substance which is fruitful.
The dyuyne science Requires not to be fulfilled with sophistycacyons nor
proposycyons ornate or polyshed / but oonly of matere of truth. Sometime
ornatynge of words makes the proposycion to be withdrawn fro the truth.
The holy lives and deuote conuersacyons of the worshypfull Patryarkes and
prophets / as Abraham. Ysaac^ and Jacob. Moses. Hely and Johan ben reduced
and showed by writing / not oonly to the end that they shall be gloryfyed
here / For they are gloryfyed of god in heaven right hyghely but also to the end
that by their virtuous works we may take doctrine of troth and ensample of
good life.

Diverse exhortacyons here folowen which begin in latin. Quide^ sanctorum
senior etc.


SOme Relygyouses persons questyoned one of the holy faders of Egypt why he
did so great abstynence. Whereunto he answered in this manner My childern it is
of necessyte yt we hate all the rest of this present life and all bodily
delectaco^ns and repleccyon of belly / without to Require any honors to be done
unto us of men / and our lord Ihesu christ shall give us honors celestyall /
life with rest eternal / and glorious gladness with his angels. This holy
man said that mete and drink are to man behouyng of necessyte / but not
withstanding men ought not to take them but for to sustain the body and not
to the full belly as much as it could well take. Sleep in likewise behooves
kyndely unto man / but also we ought not to sleep as much as the body
desires / the reason why is / because when we sleep as much as nature
appetyte is / the body thereby wexeth slowthfull whereby he is not so ready for
to work. And to the contrary watchyng yeldeth the thought and the wit of
man more subtle and more clean And therefore said the holy faders that watchyng
in good works well ordained Illumyneth the thought. And the watchynges super
flu and Inordynat bring forth franesye and madness and grieve the head and the
body full fore. Semblablyyre behooves unto man not against some other for to
moeue his passions / but for to be angry against him self and his sins / to
the end that more easily he may put them from him in amendyng of his life.
Therefore when we see our neighbors or other do any thing against the
commandment of god / we ought to anger our self against them for their
sins / and such sharply to correct in all dylygence to the end that after
their correccion and amendment they may be saved and come to everlasting
bliss.

A another holy fader being in the mids of the deserts living there in
meruayllous abstynence as Inpossible to be borne / was inquired and questioned
of some of them that sore meruaylled of his perseueraunce / and how he might
endure in a place so dry and barayne the great penaunces that he bare there.
Where at he answered that the pouerte that he suffered in this world was not
one hour of the pains of hell. And more he said that it was behofull to us
for so little a time as we have to abide in this mortal life to do penance
and resyste against the desire of the flesh / to the end that we may have the
recompense that never shall fail / that is the glory eternal. God in diverse
manners gives socours and aid to them that for the worship of him done and
accomplysshe things that be above nature. And to this purpose men find that
some time was a holy fader in Egypt / the which by his holy conuersacyon was
wounderfully enuyed of the deuylles that oftentimes grievously beat him. And one
day among other they tourmented him so sore that on the morrow by the hour
of pryme he found him self so unable by feebleness of his body / that him
seemed he was come to his last day / as well by cause of the gryef that they
had done unto him / as also by cause he had fasted to long / but
notwithstanding he dysposed him to fast unto the hour of certe. Soon after
at the same hour to him self he said that he should carry unto the hour of
se^te / and always he deyed for honger. Consequently when se^te approached / he
purposed to fast unto the hour of none. And thus by many days he took upon
him such penaunces. One day as he trowed to have taken his repast he saw a
great smoke come out of the baskete wherein he laid his bread / and the which
smoke went out at the wyndowe of his little ^elle. So purposed he to him
self that he should not ete that day / and by these abstynences was the said
holy fader so confe^ned in the faith / that he was two days without honger ne
thrust. And by mean of which abstynences and the help of god he restrained
and brought under feet the temptacyons of lecherye and glotonye.

On a time certain brethern went out of their monasterye for to vysyte the
holy hermytes in the deserte. And as god led them they arrived in the little
house of the good holy fader for said / of whom they were right souyngly
received. And because that he saw that the said brethern were weary he made
them ete before the hour acustomed and them presented of such goods as he
had. Coming toward even and after they had acomplysshed their orysons /
as well dyurnall as nocturnall / ye holy hermyte departed from them. And he
being in his gardyn he herd that the said brethern complaynyng them saying
the one to the other what is this / these hermytes here make better there than
we do that are founded in our monasteryes. The hermyte held his peace / and on
the morrow in the morning they took leave of him / and went to ye hermytage of a
another that was not far thens. The hermyte that had lodged them the night a
fore and with whom they had taken their bodily repast prayed them that they
would great in his behalue the hermyte toward whom they purposed for to go /
and that they should tell him these words. Beware that thou war not thy
coals. And they promised him to tell him so. When they were come unto him
they gave him gretyng after their promise. He understood well what his fader
hermyte mente by the gretynge that b^ him sent. So made he anon these
Relygyouses that were come to him to make baskettes and maundes till that even
was come / and him self wrought with them. When night was come / the hermyte
made his orysons not oonly after his custom / but also many suffrages he added
thereunto. After this he said to the brethern that were come to him. My brethern
and friends / our custom is not for to ete every day / but sith that ye be
come this day we shall soupe Then he took them bread and salt and a little
oil over a few coals. Their refeccyon thus take the hermyte set him self
to oryson and was thereat almoost unto the day And then he said unto them.
By cause ye be traueled my brethren we could not say all the service that we
are wont for to say / therefore rest your self a little. In the morning when
they were up they would go their ways but the hermyte would co^strayne them to
abide there with him two or three days. This notwithstanding when they saw
his abstyne^ce they departed at night without leave to take of their host. The
which Inconuenyent happed to them / because they had grutched against the
first fader hermyte that well had received and fested them at their
coming. And by this hystorye ought to us to be noted that it is not always of
necessyte to make good there to all persons / namely whenne they be unkind
and unknowing the seruyces that men have done to them / Faith and parfyte
charity make to forgete often the worldely concupyscences. And to this purpose
it is here recyted / that on a time a holy fader went for to vysyte one of his
fellows which received and entreated him much louyngly and made mete ready for
him but they would feed their souls before their bodies. So went they both
together for to pray god / and rad the psalter and the prophecyes where they
took so great pleasure that they where in their orysons still a day and a
night Then they knowing to have such passed the day / they devised together
in spekyng of holy scryptures / and were thereat unto the hour of none. After
they took leave of each other and went again to their celles or little houses.
And he that had set the pot at the fire with mete / he was sorrowful and
heavy when he came to his house of that his felawe was gone without to have
taken there his bodily refecco^n And by all this we see how by the sustenaunce
spyrytu^ll they forgate to take the refeccyon corporal.

Where as men ought to think dyscretly and by waarly delyberacyon / if a
thing is lewfull to be done or ever it shall be begone / is here recyted that
Zenon the good abbot as he yede to Palestyne found him self by the way so
weary that he was constrained to lay him self done under a tree / nygh which
tree was a field full of a fruit that we call a gourde. So thought he for to
take one of the said gourdes for his refeccyon saying that in his going he
should take no great thing of value. But or that he took it he ymagyned that
to take it without leave it were theft. So he considered in him self the
tourmente that is ordained for thieves when they have robbed any thing. And for
to within draw if he could endure such tourmentes / he put him self in the
great hete of the son / and there so Joined by the space of five days
without to depart from one place. And seeng by the great hete of the son the
which he might not bear / yet should he less endure the said tourmentes. He
said to him self that he should be no thief / and that it was better to do
his work and live soberly / than to grieve against his own self the mayeste
dyuyne and to be in danger of other and of Justice. Considering namely that
which is written / labor with thy hands and do thy besynes and certainly
thou shalt have mete and drink suffycauntly.

Humylyte against pride / and abstynence against lecherye are unto us necessary.
To this purpose we read that sometime was a dyscyple of one of the holy faders /
the which was contynuelly tempted of the sin of fornycacyon. Nevertheless
by mean of the grace of god / he resysted against it / as well by fasting and
prayers / as also by traueyllyng his body. The holy fader his master seeing
that he took so much pain and traueyll upon him / said unto him. If thou
will my sone I shall pray god that he will take from the this passion that
thou berest / to the end that thou have not so much pain to resyste against
the temptacyon of the devil. The dyscyple answered. My fader I know that this
to do I have great pain / but also I hope to gadre of it more fruit. For the
more that I feel in me the rebellyon of the flesshe^ I employe and enforce my
self much more to fast and to pray more / than I should do if I had not
the said temptacyon. Nevertheless I beseech the that thou wylt make unto goo
this Request / provided always that it will please him to give me force ever
to persevere in good works. The holy fader then said unto him. Now I know
that thou art of good will and that thou put thine entente and thine
affection soueraynly to please god. So wete it my sone / that by the pacyence
that thou shalt have in resystynge / thou shall acquyre the salvation of thy
soul. And this witnesses saint Powell that said to this purpose against the
devil. I have led good battle for I have gotten the field. And because I
have well kept the faith / from bensforth I shall enjoy the crown of Justice
/ and not I oonly / but also althose that love god and wait upon him.

Some time was a another brother that in like wise was sore tempted of the sin
of fornycacyon. One night he roose up and went toward an holy fader devout
and replenysshe of all virtues to whom he confessed his caas The holy fader
knowing his trouble / began to admoneste him of the virtue of pacyence recytyng
unto him that which the psalmyste says in the xxv. psalm. Thou that art in
temptacyon Resyste with all thy strengthes be thou steadfast and take good
courage for to sustain the commandments of god. The brother conforted of
these words went again to his hermytage / and soon he was tempted as he was
before / wherefore he returned again unto the said holy fader which
recomforted him as he had done before. And with this he gave him an hope /
saying that if he perseuered constantly / god should send him aid and
socours. So returned he home / but he was more tempted than before / and came
again to the said holy fader and besought him that he would pray for him. The
holy fader gave him ever a good hope and recomforted him in the faith / saying
that without any fawte the temptour / that is to wete the devil should goo
from him all confuse if that he resysted corageously / saying more / that where
a battle is more sharp and there as men suffer most of the party adverse /
the vyctorye is there more noble and more dygne of loynge. And to this purpose
said Ysayas / that the hand of god is ever strong enough for to socoure us /
and his e^re is ever ready for to here us / but we may not goo in paradys / but
by many pains and trybulaco^ns The brother seeing all these fair admonycyons
/ would no more return to his hermytage / but abode with the holy fader And
from hens forth he resysted against the temptacyons of the devil of hell
ledynge a life right holy and dygne of praysyng. The abbot Moses was in
likewise tempted of the sin of fornycacion so strongly that he might not
abide within his chamber / and for to find remedy thereto he came to seek
socours and comfort unto an abbot named Ysodore / of whom he was somewhat
comforted in admonestyng him to resyste if he would be champyon and very
knight of god. But nevertheless the said Moses prayed him that he should not
return to his chamber Then Ysodore seeing that he would not goo a way / he
brought him unto the highest place of his house / and made him to look out at
a wyndowe toward the part Occydentall. And as he looked up to the air / he
saw a multyde of deuyls. Then Ysodore said unto him that they were thoos
that tempte the servants of god. After that he made him to look out at a
another wyndowe toward the part Oryentall where he saw without nombre more of
good angels than he had seen of badde. Then Ysodore said to him that they
were thoo that god sent for to socour us in all our necessytees / and for to
help us to resyste aganst the deuyls temptacyons. And syn said to him such
words / wit it then Moyse / that if thou will help thy self / thou
shalt overcome the devil lightly. For we have more of good angels to help us
to resyste if we will do it / than there is of wicked spyrytes for to tempte
us Then was the abbot Moses comforted / and went again to his hermytage
utterly delybered for to resyste against the said temptacyon. A wounderfull and
laudable constau^ce had a another hermyte dooyng penance in Sychye for
because that before his professyon in the life heremytarye he had known carnaly
a much fair woman. The devil that ever shall mow begyle and deceive the
friends and seuauntes of Ihesu Christ / brought again full often in his
remembrance the same woman putting before his eyes the great beawte of her. It
happed by suffrau^ce dyuyne that a another brother came out of Egypt that
showed unto him as truth it was / that the said woman was deed. The which
thing herd by the said brother / he went to the place there she was buried /
and syn took a way the earth that was upon her and spradde his mauntell over
the deed body which was all rotyn / and meruayllously he began to rub and
styre the same his mauntell against the rotynes of the said woman's ker^as. And
this done he went again to his hermytage And when any temptacyon of the said
woman came to him / he put a fore his eyes the said stenche and enforced him
self to feel it till that the said temptacyon was passed / saying to him
self. Corrupt careyne take thy fylle of the body that so much Inordynatly
you desyrest. And by this he resysted constant^ly to the sin of fornycacyon
and lecherye.

Who soever will keep his chastyte / be ought not to haunte in places where
wymmen be / all be they never so parfyte.

Two brethern hermytes sometime departed together out of their hermytage for to
goo to the Cite next by them to selle all that they badde labored with their
hands in a year for to store them of some necessary things. They come to an
ynne / and after that they had sold all / one of them went for to seek
their prouysyons and necessytees for all the year / and the other tarried in the
house where as they were lodged. In which house at the entysynges and
temptacyon of the devil he committed the abhorred sin of fornycacyon. When
the other was come to him again / he told him that it was time to goo to
their home. He that had done the said sin answered that he could not
return declaryng unto him his sin / and that he was all desperate for the
same. That other seeing that he was in danger to be dampened / for if he had
abyden with the world / happily he had be habaundonned / not oonly to this
vice foresaid / but also to all other / for to reduce him to the way of
helthfull penance he swore and affermed unto him against truth / that in
likewise he had done such an other sin / him gyuyng to understand that it
was better that they should return and do penance such as the holy fadres
should enjoin them / than you they should ever contynuwe to do evil. After be
recomforted him of the great mercy of god / to him saying yt he never leueth
the sinner so yt he will return to him by way of penance. So went they
both together out of the cite. And he that had not sinned made like penance as
his felawe did for to give hy^ courage and good exemple to require and also for
to have a very hope to obtain of our lord his grace and mercy. And within a
while after god showed unto ye holy faders by reuelacyon dyuyne the troth of
this befalle / and yt the one gafe his body to penance for the salualo^n of
his felawe / how be it that he had not done the sin. Men may do no fayrer
almose than to give his body for to save his euencrysten and to pray god for
his soul.

An other brother there was yt semblably was tempted of ye sin of lecherye /
wherefore by diverse times he camto one holy fader that was dwelling enough
nyghe him and ever he besought him yt he would pray god for hy^ / but the more
yt the holy fader prayed / ye said brother to more besely required him to pray
for him. And for this cause ye said holy fader was both night and day in
oryson for him / but it prouffyted hy^ naught / whereof the said holy fader was
sore dyscomforted knowing yt his oryson was not herd. But our lord for to
comfort him showed to him a vysyon ye cause why he was not herd / and that it
was by occasyon of ye negligence of hy^ for whom he prayed / ye which would
not help him self for to resyst corageously against ye temptaco^n of the
deuyls / but rather took a pleasure to see the Illusyons yt the devil presented
unto him puttyng in his mind ye remembrance of many dyshonost women. And how
well yt in these folysshe Illusyons his good angel yt was full heavy and sorry
as him seemed of yt he resysted not against ye said temptacyons / nevertheless he
made no force for it. So said he to ye said brother. My friend but if ye take
courage of thy self castyng a backo ye delectaco^ns yt the devil presented to
the I can not help yt by my prayers And therefore you must put thy self in
oryson and to fast / to sygh and to weep / and other abstynences to do. Thou
know that the leche when he will give to the pacyent some remedies against his
maladye / if ye seek keep not himself from such metes yt ben contrary to his
health / with great pain the leche shall hele hy^. Also thy self ye art in
dedely sin you put no pain to recover ye grace of god yt you have lost /
but do the contrary of yt he commands the to do through ye pleasure yt you
take in ye temptaco^ns of ye flesh. Therefore help thy self / and god shall
help ye. For otherwise ye holy faders yt are leches spyrytual should not conne
because to restore to thy soul her health. The brother by these remonstraco^ns
took at his heart so great contrycyon yt he obtained the mercy of god / and ye
sclau^derous and wicked passion of lecherye went a way from him.

For no manner of need yt a man has he ought not to suffer ye any young woman
serve in his house / all be she his kynneswoman or otherwise. An her myte being
in his hermytage and doing there penance was by one his kynnes woman
wretchedly deceived. For ye devil styred ye same his kynnes woman for to see
ye said hermyte in his hermytage where he received her benyngly / and at this
cause she bode with hy^ a space of time / ye which time / he knew her
carnaly. Not far from ye same hermytage dwelled a holy fader right devout /
ye which by many days before ye caas was happed / when he put water in a
vessel of his own for hy^ to dry^ke / inco^tyne^e as he would take ye vessel
trowy^g to have dro^ken of ye water / ye vessel turned vpsodo^ne in his hand
and spylled ye water and could not drink out of it. Then he thought he would
show this to his felawe for to know what it mente. So took he his way for
to come to his hermytage / but he was beclypped of the night and constrained
for to goo lie in a Temple where Yooles were. As he slepte within the said
Temple / he herd the deuyls that said one to the other / how that night they
had made an hermyte to fall in the sin of fornycacyon with a wo^man that
was of his sybbe. The holy hermyte herynge these words was thereof sore
meruaylled. On the morrow act spring of the day he began to walk forth on
his way unto the time that he was come there as his felawe was. And entryng in
his hermytage he found him trystefull and sore to the death. After his gretynge
yeuen unto him told him how his water did spylle out of his vessel when he
should drink / and that for to have his counseyll in this matere / he was come
toward him. That other that had done the said sin of lecherye answered.
Alas my brother I have gretter need of thy counseyll / than thou of mine / for
the last night I fell in to the foul dyshonest and abhomynable sin of
fornycacyon / whereof I have offended my god and my maker wyckedly. Then his
felawe said to him / that he wist it well and showed him the manner / how he
being a sleep within a Temple of Ydoles had herd the deuyls saying the one
to the other that which is said. Then he that had sinned as without hope
would have gone to the world and forsake his hermytage. But that other
recomforted him as well as he could / praynge him to abide still in his tell /
and that better it was to sheue out the said woman to the end they two together
might do penance till that god had pardonned him his sin / the which
thing he did / and sith led a life much devout and holy.

When men are ouermoche vexed and trauaylled of the devil / and tempted of the
sin of fornycacyon / the sovereign remedy is to occupye him self in prayers
and orysons / or in temporal works / and flee ydlenes which is the rote of
all vices.

To this purpose we read that an holy hermyte being in a place named Celya /
the which by the deuyls was sore tempted for to acomplysshe the sin of
lecherye. He considered in him self that it was of necessyte that he should
set him self to some work by ye which his body were strongly trauaylled
Now this brother was a potmaker / so aduysed he yt he should make a woman of
earth / and in deed he did so / after yt she was made / he said to his
thoughts ye tourmented him of ye sin of fornycacyon yt he had a woman to
keep. But because yt this notwithstandy^g he was ever tempted as above / he
ymagyned to labor more than he had done tofore / and made childern of earth
saying after to his thoughts when they moeued hy^ to lecherye that he had
both wife and childern. Morouer for to overcome his passions / he purposed to
labor more than he had done before / sayng that needs he must trauaylle /
as well for to get his wife and childern their living / as also for to clothe
them. Fynably he swaged and traueyled his flesh / so that with pain he
might remoeue him self. And thus god seeing his great perseueraunce took away
from him all these foul thoughts and him replenysshed with his grace /
whereof he gloryfyed and gave thanks and lauds to the name of our savior and
redemptour Ihesu christ Nothing is more light to be brought than is the
temptacyon of the sin of the flesh. And because that in the said sin
soon take great and Inordynate love. It is of necessyte that the nourysshynge
of the said sin be put away by oryson and making leene of the body. To
this purpose a brother asked ones to an abbot named Poemen what thing he might
do for to Resyste against the sin of fornycacyon / whereof he suffered and
endured so great pain that he lost thereby his entendement and be came as
furyouse. The holy abbot answered unto him that the sovereign remedy had be
found by the prophet Dauyd that says. I have stroke the lion / and often I
have slain the beer. That was to say / that he took a way the woodnesse and
the enforced anger of his heed. That was the bowyng and Inordynate will of
this sin of fornycacyon. And by this mean also by the labor and vexacyon of
his body he despised and overcame the sin of fornycacyon.

Here fynysshed the exortacions how men ought to eschew the sin of
fornycacyon. Other exortacyons folowen for to acquyre the virtue of pacyence
and humylyte beginning in latin (Diceba^t sancti seniores etc.


OTher exortaco^ns writes saint Ierom for to have the noble virtue of
humylyte which is the foundement of all virtues / and also the right necessary
virtue of pacyence. And first he puts an exemple of an holy hermyte that
enhabyted ye deserts of Sychye which was boundman and thrall to some lords
dwelling in the Cite of Alexandrye. This hermyte every year came done from his
hermytage in to ye Cite for to bring them the pensyon yt he ought to them as ye
seruau^ts done to their lords / but ye said lords yt toward him had great
reverence and parfyte love came him against requyrynge him yt he would pray god
for them / when he was come his custom was to give them their said pensyon /
and to put water in to a bassyn for to wasshe their fete as holden he was to
do because of his said lordshyppe. The said lords that would not that he
should serve them of so low service said unto him. O fader right benygne /
do not unto us so great wrongs / as for to wasshe our fete. For surely thou
angrest us if thou do so. Then the holy fader answered to them. The
almighty and sovereign god Ihesu christ has ordained you to be my lords and I
to be your thrall whereof I thank him / and therefore I ought to do to you this
scruyce as your bound man. I pray you right hertly that ye will take a worth
this little scruyce / and that ye receive the pensyon that I owe you. The
lords answered that they should never take pensyon more of him. But he
answerde against them saying / if they took not the said pensyon / that he
should never return to his hermytage / but should serve them all his life.
Then they ferynge lest he should be angry / and to the end he should goo
again to his hermytage / they took the said pensyon / and gave it Incontynente
to the poor folk for gods sake.

Ones upon a time they questyoned him why he brought to them this pensyon as a
bound man sith that they would not take it. And he answered he did so for to
quyte him of the oblygacyon where of he was bound to them / and also ferynge
lest he should lose the merit of his fasting watchynge and orysons / if he
paid not the pensyon that he ought unto them / supposing in his mind if he
paid it not / that the gooddes that he did in his hermytage should return
to the prouffyte of his lords under whose lordshyppe his oratorye or little
house was build and set.

Good and kind fraternity is often cause of devotion / but yet much more the
goostly fraternity.

Two men were brethern germayn and goostly brethern / for they were both
together relygyouses. The devil envy of all bounte trowed to have departed
them one from the other and would have put dyscencyon between them. It happed
ones that the youngest of both lyghted a candell at even. And as he should
put it in the candelstyck / the devil Inuysybly made it to fall done to
the ground and put it out trowyng to moeue noise and dyuysyon among the
said two bre^heren. So rose up the eldest brother in great wrath smote the
youngest / the which lyenge at ground began to say. O my lord be pacyente
I shall go light it again. The devil seeing that the youngest had given so
gracious an answer / and that by this mean he might not bring them in
dyfferente / incontinent he went from them all confuse. And the next night the
devil showed it to the prince of the deuyls / saying that for the humylyte of
the yongeste Relygyouse be could not have sewed hatred nor dyuys^on among
them. Saying more over that our lord by occasyon of his said humylyte had
spredde over him his grace / whereof he was sore tourmented. The priest of the
law that herkened the narracions of the same devil was wounderfully abashed
And consyderyng the great loss of the souls that the devil drue to him by
the train of Ydolatry / went to the holy faders for to be Instruct of them in
the doctrine of our blessed savior and Redemer Ihesu Christ. Recytyng to them
this that the deuyls had purposed that same night. And fynably after that he
was baptized he took the habyte of an hermyte. And syn by the mean of the
grace of god of the which he was replenysshed / he was a man of right holy
life. And pryncypally he was so humble / that all the faders were meruayled of
his great humylyte. And he affermed that the virtue of mekenes is that same
that most overcome the deuyls of hell. Also by mekenes god our blessed
savior and redemptour has vyctoryously brought under foot all the puyssaunce
of the devil. More over he certefyed that a another time he herd the deuyls
say / that when they tempte any by mocion of Iniurye the one against the other
/ if the one suffers pacyently the Iniuryes that be done to him / prayng him
that of Iniuryeth him to have pacyence as the young hermyte did to his brother
/ Incontinent the deuyls have no more puyssaunce to trouble nor tyse him to
sin. How be it that virtue is worthy to be honored / always the virtuous
person ought to flee the places where men do to him honor / to the end that
the devil tempte him not by vain glory.

The abbot Poemen to this purpose recou^ted to his brethern / that in the ryme
that Theodosius was Emperor of Constantynople. There was an hermyte that had
a little house without the town of Constantynople nyghe enough to a place of
pleasure where the Emperors went gladely to pass the time by manner of
recreacion. Theodosius knowing of the said hermyte and that he never went out
of his said house purposed for to goo vysyte him. And when he was nyghe the
said place / he made his folk to tarry and would goo there all one. So came
he and knocked at the hermytes door. The holy hermyte rose up anon and
opened the gate. After that the Emperor was entered there ynne / he looked all
about the chamber and he found there no thing but a little dry bread. He
prayed the said hermyte that he would give him some mete. The holy man
presented him Incontynente bread / salt / and water. Then after that the
Emperor asked him how the holy faders of Egypt did live in the deserte.
Where unto he answered that contynuelly they prayed and were in their orysons
for the salvation of their souls.

More over the Emperor asked him if he knew him not. And he answered nay.
Then the Emperor told him that he was Theodosius the Emperor of
Constantynople. Then the hermyte kneled done on his knees a fore him to the
ground. But Theodosius took him up saying in this manner. Ye Relygyouses are
right happy in this present world / for ye live without solycytude and are
ever in peace. All your labor is to do the salvation of your souls / and to
acquere the Royalme of paradyse. And in good sothe I tell the holy fader that I
that am Emperor had never rest / but I have be and am contynuelly in labor
and trybulacyon / and be it in drynkyng or in etyng. Dame solycytude comes and
tells my morcelles. After the Emperor salued him honestely and took leave of
him. The man of god consyderyng all the night how the Emperor was come to him
/ was a ferde that many other lords should come in likewise to him Wherefore
dredynge the great honor that they might have done to him / purposed to goo
thens And in deed he went to the deserte of Egypt with the other holy faders
/ to the end that he were not withdraw nor brought from his humylyte by the
pleasure that he might have taken in the vysytacyons of the lords that should
have comen see him. So ought we well to take heed to the exemple of the said
holy fader that took so much pain upon him for to keep his humylyte without
which we may not come to the everlasting glory.

Of the said abbot Poemen Recou^ted the holy faders that on a time the Judge of
the prouynce where he was that had herd many things of his holiness sent
him word and prayed him that he would wouchesauffe to receive him in to his
house / for he would goo see him. The holy man Poemen thought in him self that
if the said Judge should come to him / many other might also come there / where
by his conuersacyon should be known the which he had kept so secretly
sithe the time of his yongthe. And by this might the devil thrughe his
cautele and malice tempte him of vain glory. And thus he should lose all the
merit that he had acquered.

All these things considered / the abbot Poemon sent word to the said Judge
that he should not receive him This answer herd the Judge was angry and wroth
supposyng that the holy fader would not receive him because he was to great a
sinner. Always he thought in him self by what manner he might best speak with
him. So he aduysed him self and made to be take and brought to prison the sone
of the sister of the said holy man / ymagynyng that when the said saint
Poemen should know of it he should come for to sue his delyueraunce toward
him / or else he should be content for to Receive him in his celle or little
house. And this done he sent word to the holy abbot Poemen / that he should
not be wroth for the prysonement of his neuewe. For as soon as he would come
and speak with him he should be delivered out of prison. The sister of the
said holy man all washed in teeres went to ye deserte for to tell him these
tidings / but he had a meruayllous constau^ce / for he another opned ye door
nor spoke not to his sister wherefore she as a woman from her wit began for to
curse Poemen be cause of yt he had no co^passyon over her saying O right hard
herted and evil man ^^ thy heart made of iron which can not be moeued through
the teeres of thy sister Germayn. I have but one oonly sone which thou leuest
in danger only by cause yt will not obey to the petycyon of the Judge. The
abbot Poemen sent anon such or semblable words unto the Judge. Sir Judge.
Poemen has no childern of his body begoten over whom he ought to sorrow ne
make co^passyon. The Judge herynge this words / sent him a letter contaynyng
this that follows. Abbot Poemen if you will not come to speak with me to
the end yt thy neue we may be delyuerd / write unto me in form of a
supplycacyon / and I shall grant all that y shalt desire of me. Then at
the exhortaco^n of some thabbot Poemen wrote to him in this manner. Thy noblenes
shall make good informaco^n of the life of my neuewe / and if he has deserved
death make him deye / to the end yt in this present world he be punysshed of
his sins / whereby he may eschew yt pain everlasting And if he has not
done that thing whereby he should be worthy to suffer death for it / make of him
yt which thou may suffer to be do after thy laws.

A another of the holy faders of Egypt named Agathon very pacyent and humble was
of some brethren vysyted / by cause they desired to know his great pacyence
and humylyte yt men said was in him. And for to preue hy^ they said to him many
great Iniuryes him repreuyng yt all his holy faders were sclau^dred through his
pride / and yt by his exaltaco^n he setted all the other to naught in bachytyng
and blasphemyng them / With this they said to him / that ye cause why he
blaphemed his felawes / it was by cause he was lecherous. And to the end yt men
should not suppose nor deem him self allone to be lecherous / he contynuelly
sclaundred the other. The holy man Agathon to these Iniuryes and other answered
humbly / that he could not deny the sins of ye which he was by them accused
/ but knew to have co^mysed them and done / and after kneled done before them
and said. My brethern I beseech you yt it will please you to pray god for me
yt am a right wretchyd sinner / to the end that by your orysons my god will
pardonne me / and that through your merytes I may have thereof Indulgence and
remyssyon. The brethern Iniuryed hy^ more than they had done before / saying
that he was an heretyke. But the holy fader then answered. My brethern I
knowledge my self a great sy^ner / but ye sy^ne yt ye may put upon me hurts
another my soul nor my body / for it is naught in me. The said brethern after
yt they had herd his answer / they casted hem self down on her knees before
him requyryng him yt it would please him to pardonne them that which they had
surmysed upon him / and praised him of his great humylyte by the which he
had endured all pacyently without moeuyng of him self. Then said Agathon
for to keep humylyte / of the which grows Infynyte fruits. I have will to
suffer all except the accusacyon of the vice of heresye.

Our savior Ihu^ christ endured all ye Iniuryes and shames yt the Jews deed to
him for to give us exemple of humylyte. Also he suffered the devil to tempte
him. But when the devil purposed to make him self to be worshypped by him /
he might not suffer it. For that self Iniurye reproved to the deyte Always he
endured unto the death the false excusacyons and besynes that the Jews
wytnessed against him / gyuyng unto us exemple / that we ought to endure and
bear pacyently all Iniuryes and rebukynges. But as touching the sin of
heresye whereof ye have accused me for because that the said sin makes men to
be departed from god / and Joins them with the devil I have not mow for
this cause endure it. For if we were departed from god we should not wete to
whom we should pray for the remyssyon of our sins. And of the other part
if we be Joined unto him / he shall be our protector and shall give us at the
last his Royalme so that we do our deuoy^ toward him. At that time all the
holy faders and relygyouses that enhabyted the deserte of Suchye were assembled
in their church which is set in thoo deserte / for to these Ysaac for their
great priest and sovereign bishop In which church at certain days they
all ^omo^yd together and those the said Ysaac. The which herynge these tidings
fled in to Egypt. Then many of the brethern fled after him. But they were
take of the night so that for that time they could not find him. And ye good
Ysaac desyryng to be far fro them / to the end that they should not find him
be hid him self within a great busshe. The brethern seeing yt they might not
goo no more they vnladed an ass that they had which bare their vytayles for to
ete by the way. and let him go to pasture where he would. But a wou^derfull
thing happed / for the ass went straight to pasture and rest him self at
the busshe where the holy fader Ysaac was. And in ye morning when they would
have gone forth on their way / they yede to the said busshe where they found
their ass by ye holy man which they would have bound and brought by force
with them. But he would not late him be bound / but answerde to them in great
humylyte. My brethern I see well yt it is the will of god that I shall obey to
you. So a^^ I delybered to please you and to accept the charge that ye give me
how be it that I am unworthy.

Also in ye said deserte were two brethern dwelling tegyder / the which
because of their pacyence and humylyte were greatly commended and praised of the
other brethern. The one of them willing to preue if they were parfyte in
mekenes and pacyence went and vysyted them / and he was received of them
honestly and with great Joy. After that they had done together their orysons as
they were wont / he that was come for to tempte them lepte out of their celle
and little house and entered in a lyt^ll gardyn where they gadred some coals /
and then for to have angered the said ^^^thern / he took a staff and brake
and marred all their coals that grew well f^^yre and high except one cole
allone. But the brethern seeing his manner doing said to him no thing / but
showed to him a merry countenance and made him good chere. Soon after they
withdrewe to their house for to say euensonge (...) they had said euensong /
they (...) to him that had wasted their co^^^ (...) if a pleases the we shall
(...) at the fire (...) cole that is left hole / for is time for to take a
refeccyon Ch^^^ this other brother knowing their great charity / humylyte and
pacyence / began to comfort them sayng I thank god our creator of the graces
that he has given to you. For I knew that the holy ghost is with you And
therefore I pray you my brethern that unto the death ye keep ever in you p^rfye
humylyte and pacyence / for by the same yt shall be elect and chosen great
lords in the Joy of heaven.

In a monasterye was a relygyous the which by long season had be febled by
maladye / and the brethern wyste not how to recover unto him his health because
they had no delycate metes whereof he could recover his appetyte to mete /
and also they were not well learned to attend upon syke folk. A devout woman
consyderyng these things / besought the abbot yt he would send to her house
ye said relygyous / saying yt more easily she might find and get in ye cite
that yt were needful for his health to recover / than the relygyouses could do
in their monasterye. The which request herd of ye said abbot yt desired right
much the recover and health of his relygyous / granted to the said woman /
and sent to her house yt said Relygyous / to whom to good intent ^^ryng the
space of three year she admynystred to him all his necessytees and made him to
be tended right well. But because that he was so long syke with her / m^^y one
spoke of it / saying that it was not to be belyued that this relygyous might
company so long with ye said woman without he should sin grievously with her.
The good relygyous being yet syke was enfourmed of this spekyng / wherefore he
made his prayer unto god saying. O my sovereign god that allone without other
see and knoweste the great euyls and vexacyons which I endure and the need
in which I am in / where it is so that I know the very rewardone of those
that for the honor of the do some seruyces to thy pouer and nedy servants.
I beseech the humbly that it will please the by thy great and benygne
lyberalyte to reward this good woman in the live everlasting of all the goods
and seruyces by her done unto me for the love of the / gyuynge unto her the
hundred fold reward thereof / as thou have promised in the holy scripture to
them that shall serve the truly. The which prayer the same Relygyous continued
long time and unto the hour of his death. But a fore that he decessed in the
presence of many Relygyouses and other folk of devotion that were come to see
him in that last necessyte. He desired that the staff whereon he lened in time
of his sykenesses / should be plau^ted and set upon his grave / in exortyng
the assystentes and other thad had spoken of him and of his good kepar / that
if they had had over them any evil opinion / that when the said staff
should spring and have flowers and should bear fruit / they should then
have steadfast belyue that he never had sinned with her. And if it wexed not
grene beryng fruit / that they should give credence to the words that men
had said of him and of her as for a truth. The which thing was done so.
And it happed myraculously that the staff after that he was set upon his
grave in the earth as he had desired / suddenly it wexed grene with flowers and
bare fruit / whereof all the brethern together honored and gloryfyed the might
of god. And Saint Ierom writes that he him self saw the tree that proceeded
and grew of the said staff. By this it appyreth unto us well openly that god
our blyssed creator keeps curyously them that of good affection and very
confydence serve him. And what some ever sclaunder or shame that is done to us
wrongfully / we ought to hope verily / that the truth by miracle or otherwise
/ shall be soon or late known A poor man which was vexed and thrauaylled of
the devil was brought to an holy abbot named Appolon by some folk the which
prayed hy^ three days during affectuelly that he would deliver out of this
Inconuenyence the poor syke. The said holy man at their prayers and
supplycacyons answered that he was not of so great merit toward god that he
should have given unto him any power or auctoryte of the deuyls. But what
answer that he made to them / they more and more prayed him / wherefore he
seeing their great constaunce / came to fore the said syke and coniured the
devil saying. In the name of god our creator. O spyryte Infamed I command
the that thou depart soon out of the body of this creature. The devil
then answered. I never abode in place when I am commanded in the name of god
to depart. Nevertheless or that I shall goo I ask the said the devil /
what betokenen in the gospel these words / what are the wethers / what are ye
sheep / whereat ye holy man answered in this manner. The wethers represente the
Unjust and wyeked among the which I am the worste because of my great and
outrageouse sins. But as to the sheep god only knows them. Then the
devil cryeng with a loud voice said. Ha Appolon I may not because of thy
great humylyte abide no longer before the. And Incontinent he left the
pacyente as half deed that he had before tourmented so sore / and yede away
cryeng horrybly / and was herd of all them that were present / which saw
the miracle whereof they rendered thanks unto our lord that so great miracles
does by the merytes of his humble servants

After the Rehersall of the holy faders / sometime was a Relygyouse in the
deserte of Sychye / the which desiring for to be Instruct in good manners for
the salvation of his soul / he went for to see ye holy faders that dwelled in
a place called Cely^. And when he was come there / he wyste not where to lodge
him self for the great multitude of Relygyouses that were there. The which
thing seeing one of them / moeued of compassyon / delivered him a celle or
little house that he had / and told him that he should abide there till that
he had found on other. After that he had be there a little while many of
the brethern came and vysyted him for to here and learn of him some good for
the soul. For he had that gift of god that he could well teache prudently
other folk. The Relygyouse that had lodged him was much enuyous of the
worship that the other Relygyouse made him / and said to him self. It is
long a goo that I first come dwell in this deserte / and now the brethren
come not see me but oonly upon the holy days / and every day they come to
vysyte and see him to whom I have taken my lodgys / the which came but now
late a goo. Then he sent him word by his dyscyple that he should goo out of
his said lodgys. for he would occupye it. The dyscyple came to the holy fader
and showed him his eraunde all the countrarye saying. Fader devout / my fader
has sent me unto the for to wit how thou do / for he herd say that thou
was like. Ha good servant / he was not like the servant of this time present
which be more ready to bear the evil tidings than good. The holy fader
answered to the dyscyple / that he should thank humbly his fair fader and
that he should recomende him to his devout prayers / and in likewise said to
the said dyscyple that he should pray for him / for he felt his stomach right
sore enfebled. The dyscyple came again to his fair fader and said to him. My
fader he prays the right affectuelly that thou give him space to avoid two
days hanging the which he shall see for to be purueyed of a another. After
that three days were passed / he sent again his dyscyple to tell to the said
holy fader that he should depart / or else he should hunte him out with a
staff.

The dyscyple returned to the holy fader to whom he said. Fair fader I come
here because that my fader is in great pain to know if thou art better at
ease than thou were before / this three days were passed / and therefore tell me
how thou feleste now thy self. The holy man answered. My brother I thank god
hyghely of that thou haste take so much pain for me / for certaynely by thy
prayers I have recouernd my health. The dyscyple came to his abbot and said to
him. My fair fader he prays the as much as to him is possible / that it
will please the to have pacyence till sunday / and incontinent he shall
depart. The sunday was come / and the Relygyous sore moeued with envy went
out of his lodgyse with a staff for to chase out the other from his house.
Then the dyscyple seeing the furour of his master prayde him that he would
suffer him goo a fore / to the end if any brethern were with the other
Relygyouse / that he should not be shamed to make him any gryfe. The dyscyple
Incontinent departed and came to the devout Relygyouse and told him thus. My
fader and friend. My fair fader comes toward the I counseyll the to goo from
hens against him / for he loves the oboue all other. Then issued the good man
out of the house well glad / and when he was come to him he kneled on his
knees and said. O my right well beloved brother I thank the much of thy celle
that thou have lent me for gods sake / to whom humbly I beseech that he
will reward the for it in the life that ever shall last. That other holy fader
threw then the staff from him and took him in his arms for to kiss him.
After he poynted himself for to go take his repast with hem in his celle
foresaid. And when they were arrived the fair fader abbot demanded of his
dyscyple if he had done to the other his messages that he had charged him
to tell him for to make him to void his lodgys. The dyscyple answered.
Certaynely fair fader I tell the that when thou commanded me to go to him I
durst not for the reverence and obeyssaunce that I owe unto the as to my fader
/ answer any words against the / but nevertheless I never told him that /
that thou hade me tell him. The Relygyouse heryng the dyscyple speak / and
knowing his prudence. Incontynente be cast him self done at his fete and
said to him. I promise the that from hens for thou thou shalt be my master /
and I shall be thy dyscyple. For by thine attemperaunce and the good dread that
thou have had of me thou haste delivered my soul fro sin. And by this we
see / that servants ought to love more the salvation of their masters souls
/ than to their wicked wylles against their sauete / to obtempre or he agreeable.

The holy faders testyfyed to one named Johan that was dyscyple of Pawle the
abbot / that this Johan was veraye pacyent humble and obeyssaunte. And when his
abbot commanded any thing for to be do / how well that they were dyffycyle /
he never said their against nor murmured against him. It happed ones yt in his
monasterye men had great need to have a quantyte of dong of oxen / so sent the
abbot Powle his dyscyple Johan for to fette the said donce where as he could
find it. The dyscyple Incontinent yielded him self ready for to go but
nevertheless he told hy^ yt he had herd many persons say yt there about was
a lioness yt devoured the folk yt she met. Thabbot all playnge said unto
hy^ / go go care not for it if she come to the you shall by^de her and shall
bring her with the. This said ye good dyscyple Johan departed and sought so
long till yt he had found the said ^onge yt he sought / but the lioness came
there the which lept upon hy^ for to have devoured him. The young dyscyple
desyry^g to do yt his master had commanded hy^ enforced him self for to take
her / but she scoup out of his hands / he ra^ne after her saying. O best tarry
thy self / my fader abbot has told me / yt I should bind yt to the end yt I
should bring ye before hy^. Then by suffrau^ce dyuyne ye said best tarried her
self still till yt she was bound / and fynably suffered herself to be led by
ye dyscyple unto the presence of his abbot / yt which seeing this miracle
gloryfyed yt name of god. And his dyscyple said to hy^. My fader ^ have
acomplysshed and done yt ye you dedest command me. Thabbot dredyng yt the
dyscyple should gloryfye himself of this work done of hy^ repreued hy^
gretely saying. Thou art an ouermoche fool to have brought hither this ferfull
best and therefore unbind you her to the end that she may go where she list her
self

One of the holy faders sent ones his dyscyple to fette water at a well
which was far from his celle or cotage. This dyscyple forgate to take with
hy^ the cord for to have his bokette do^ne in to the well whereof he was full
sorry when he found him self without it at ye said well. For he wist not how
to do for to draw water / nor he durst not go home without. And fyndyng
himself thus troubled / he began to pray god on his knees and sore weeping
made unto him such a Request and oryson. O my god that haste made the heaven
the earth / the sea / and all the meruayllouse things that be therein / you
knoweste that thy servant has sent me here for to bring him water. I beseech
the that thou will suffer that I may bear him some. Soon after he turned his
speech upon the well saying. O well give socours to the seruau^te of god mine
abbot yt has sent me here for to bring him of thy water. And incontynente
after these words said / by ye suffrau^ce of god dyuyne / the water of the
said well aryesed her self up unto the borders of the well above. And when
the dycyple had filled his vessel the water went do^ne again in her own
place. And this done the dyscyple went and bare water to his abbot thankyng
and gloryfyeng the name of our lord.

Eulalius was a good Relygyouse full of all humylyte and of so great symplenes
that when any thing blameful was done in the monasterye where he dwelled / they
that had done it scused them / saying that the said brother Eulalius had done
it. And then when his elders came to repreue him of the fautes that
wrongfully and without cause were put upon him / the good Relygyouse by his
great humylyte kneled on both his knees before them and asked them thereof
pardon as if he hy^ self had co^mysed the said fautes. And because that the
said elders toward whom he was often times accusyd / saw that he corrected
not himself for their admonyco^ns / they following the rules of the monasterye
set him to fast many days for his penance. And he bare it all pacyently
obeynge to his said elders and to all their wylles the which trowyng by the
acusaco^ns that the other young brethern made against him whereof he scused not
him self / that he ever should persevere in his malice and wyckednes without to
correct ne amend him self in any wise / went to their fader abbot for to
ask him what of the said brother Eulalius was to be done / the which they
said was Incorrygyble. For the wend not that he endured the said penance by
his humylyte / but byleued that he made all such fautes as he was acused of.
So said they to the said abbot O fader we have as much as to us has be
possible suffered and endured the great fautes of the brother Eulalius / by
whose wickedness sloth and neclygence all the necessaryes and ornaments of
our church be wasted toren and broken / he sets naught by our correccyons
and will do no thing for us. And therefore we are come toward the for to wit
what thy will is to be done in this behalf. The abbot then answered to them.
My brethern let us abide awhyle and have pacyence / and then after we shall
dyspose thereof as we shall see most expedyent and lawful to be do. This
answer so done / the abbot entered in his secret oratorye / and made his
request unto god to the end he would Instruct him what was to be done of the
said Relygyouse / which thing was to him showed of our lords dyuyne
reuelacyon. And anon he assembled all his relygyouses / to whom he said this
that follows. My brethren believe me. I ensure you I love better the matte of
Eulalius with his humylyte and pacyence / than all the works of those that
murmr against him and that dysprayse him And to the end that ye shall know
what merit he has toward god / bry^ge me here all your mattes and ye shall
see what I shall do. The mattes yt brought and set togydre all in a hepe the
fader abbot made them to be fyred And in effect nothing abode there vnbrente /
except oonly the matte of the good Eulalius / the which in the mids of all
the other abode hole without any hurt of the fire. All the brethern seeing
this miracle humbly Required him pardon of that they had spoken and lied upon
him / and sith bare him honor as to one of the gretest of their monasterye.
Eulalius seeing that men did to him so great honor doubtyng to lose humylyte
by vayn glory or otherwise departed upon a night and yede his way to
enhabyte him self in the deserte within a cave for to eschew the worship and
pride of the world.

It is prouffytable and necessary that we knew the laudable virtue of
pacyence of the holy fader abbot Anastasius to the end yt we consyderyng the
same / and his meruayllous magnanymyte and kyndenesse / we enforce oureself to
be such at his exemple. He had a book of fyn parchemen co^teynyng both the
old and the new testamente / the which was of great price and value. For it
was estymed to be worth.xviij. shylyng of the money that at that time had
course / the which should draw to a right great sum of silver of the money
that is now occupied in this land. A Relygyouse came toward him for to see
him / and seeing that he was not in his lodgys / saw the said book the which
because that it seemed him fair he took it and bare it away as a thief.
Anastasius returned sought his book for to study in it / but he found it
not. And because he was told that the said Relygyouse had be in his lodgys /
he thought that he had robbed it / and dredynge lest he should forswere
himself if he made questyon unto him of it / he durst not tell him nothing of
it. Within a while after the said Relygyouse brought the said book with him to
be sold in a Cite most nere to the monasterye of the said saint Anastasius.
And because that the merchant to whom the said Relygyouse would have sold
the said book / would not by it withstanding this that he knew not how much
it might well be worth / he lent thereupon the sum of.xvi. shelynges. And
this done he came to the holy fader Anastasius for to show him the said book
and to wit of him if it was well worth the said.xvi. shelynges. The good abbot
Anastasius andswered unto hy^ ye / and that it was a good book. So went again
the merchant to the said brother / and gaf him for it certain price of silver
by a sale made between them / and with this bargayne he told him / that the
abbot Anastasius had told him yt it was a good book and that it was well
worth the price. Then was the brother sore aferde and asked of the said
merchant / if the said abbot had not told him none other thing. The which
answered that nay. The brother herknyng after these words was right sorry and
asked the book again of the said merchant. And syn after in great compunccyon
yielded it ayene to the bishop Anastasius prayeng him that he would forgive him
his sin. Anastasius would not take again the said book / but gave it unto
him desyryng him that he should take it with him / but the brother would never
depart thens till Anastasius had taken it again as his own / and syghed and
wept full sore askyng pardon of his sin. When the holy abbot saw his
compunccyon / he took this brother for to dwell with him / with whom he abode
all the days of his live.

An other hermyte there was sometime named Pyot yt which abode a space of time
with saint Anthony / when the said Pyot was come to.xxv. year of his age / of
the consentyng of saint Anthonye / he went to a place much secret and far
from all folk for to live there solytaryly / the which place was set betwix
the land of Nitrye and the deserte of Sychye / when he was come to the said
place / he was constrained to make a well for to have water out of the earth.
And as he was deluynge and besy about it / he purposed to drink of such water
that he should find there. It happed that it was found so salt and so bitter
/ that all thoo yt came there to see this holy hermyte were constrained to
bring water with them because they might not drink of the water of his well
forsayde. Nevertheless the good Pyot used the same water during ye space
of.xxx. year and had none other drink. And when the other brethern deed tell
him that he should depart from the said place for to eschew the said water /
he answered to them. My brethern if we flee the bytternesses of this world /
how trow ye that we be worthy to have the Joys of paradyse. This Pyot lived
an hard life and a sharp. For when he went to any other place / he bare with
him but a lofe of bread as black as ashys and of fygges five. In.xxx. year he
never went out of his hermytage / another for death of his parents nor for any
other necessyte. At the end of.xxx. year a wydowe his own sister sent two
of her childern to pray him that he would come speak with her a fore her death
/ to whom he answered that he would not goo to her. Wherefore this two
childeren went toward saint Anthonye and prayed him that he would command
him for to goo vysyte his sister. And saint Anthonye did so. So took the good
hermyte Pyot a another Relygyouse with him and obeynge to the commandment of
saint Anthonye went for to vysyte his sister. When they were come at her
house / he closed his eyes by cause he should not see her / and after said unto
her. I am thy brother / behold me as much as thou will / and Incontynente he
departed and went again to his hermytage. And this he did for to Instruct
the prelates and abbottes / that they should not give leave to their relygyouses
for to see their parents or neighbors when they would goo their for the
great Inconuenyences that should mow happen there by.

An abbot called Johan dwelling in a mountain named Calamys had in likewise a
sister which was a woman of Relygyon / the which had tysed him for to
forsake the world / and all the vanytees of the same. He was xxiiij. year that
he went never out of his monasterye and without to go vylyte his sister / how
well she desired sore to see him. And to this intent she sent him lettres by
the which she prayde him humbly that he would come and speak with her a fore
the ending of her life for to be comforted of him at her last end.
Nevertheless he would not goo there. Wherefore she wrote to him again letyng
him to wit if he came not unto her / yt she should be constrained for to go to
hy^ herself The holy abbot was then sore on angered thynkyng in him self /
but if he did against the entente and purpose of his sister / he should be
cause that / many other women at the exemple of her should undertake in like
wise for to goo see their kynnesmen that were of Relygyon / to the great
hurtynge of their salvation / wherefore he loved better for to go to her / than
that she should have occasyon for to come to him. So took he two of his
Relygyouses with him for to bear him company / and went to the monasterye
where his sister was. And after that he had knocked at the gate / his
sister came there acompanyed with two other women of Relygyon. But because that
in.xxiiij. year they had not seen each other she knew not her brother / the
which nevertheless knew her well / but he would not make him to be known.
The brethern that were come with him asked of her some water for to drink /
for they were weary and chaffed of the way. And after that they had drunk
they returned again to their monasterye without any other word to have with
her. Wherefore she not knowing that it had be he / and wrote unto him again /
that he should come see her / or else her soul perysshed. The abbot her
brother for an answer sent her word / how that he had be with her by that
same token that she had given them drink / wherefore it should suffyse her /
and otherwise she should not see him. And with this by his lettres prayed her /
that she would have him for ever Recomended in prayers toward god / for to
obtain more easily by mean of the same the salvation of his soul.

An other Relygyouse did otherwise. Some folk brought him word that his
sister was syke / and anon he purposed for to goo to her that had not sent
for him / when he was come to the monasterye where she was professed.
Incontinent she sent to him word that he should return again and that she
would not speak with him / but and god would she should see him in heaven. And
this did the good lady for to show that the men ought not to be lycenced nor
suffered all be they parents or other what so ever they be to haunte in the
monasteryes where women of Relygyon be.

For to know the virtues of the abbot Theodorus / it is to be noted that he
was dyscyple of Saint Pachomyen of whom is written here before where it is
touched how in Thebayde be many monasteryes and Infynyte Relygyouses under him.
It happed that the sister of the said Theodorus for to see him / transported
her self unto the monasteryr whereof he was abbot / to whom some of his
Relygyouses Incontynente that she was come went and showed unto him her
coming. The which thing by him known / not wyllyng for to speak with her /
sent her word / that it might suffyse her to know yt he was in good health /
and that she should not care no more for to come see him. Morouer prayed her
that she should Renounce the deceyuable vanytees of the world / and that she
should take her to the astate of Relygyon / to the end that she should come to
the felycyte and beatytude eternal / and after that she should think in her
self that if she did not so in keeping the commandments of god / she
might not in no wise be saved. And to the this purpose in having steadfast
faith and hope in god / without any doubt she should live euerlastyngly. When
she had herd his answer / as she had be Inspyred of the holy ghost / she
yielded her in a monasterye of women of Relygyon where she was of right holy
conuersacyon. The mother of the said Theodorus when she understood these
tidings / made some bysshopes to write unto saint Pachomyen fader abbot of the
said Theodorus her sone / that he should command him for to come speak with
her / and Saint Pachomyen did so at the request of the said bysshopes that
had written to him for it. Theodorus after the lettres of his fadr abbot seen
and read that his mother had brought him / sent her word that for feere to
offend god / he durst not speak with her. For thus to do he should give to
many a Relygyouse both to men and women occasyon and manner to do the same.
Wherefore he prayed her that she would content herself and that for that time
with him she should not speak. She then abydyng at ye gate when she knew
that he would not come speak with her / purposed to herself never to return
at her house. So went she to a monasterye of virgyns which was nyghe
enough by the said abbaye / saying in herself that she should see him some
time whenne he should goo out of it for the needful affairs of the same /
ymagynynnge also / that she might profit in the monasterye of ye said virgyns
for ye holy and devout life yt they led their / whereby lightly she might do
her saluaco^n in taking exe^ple to ye constau^ce of her sone. Saint Pachomyen
of whom is written here before did meruaylouse things and was almoost egall
unto saint Anthonye. He made on a time his prayer unto god yt in a certain time
he might have no lust for to sleep / to the end yt night and day he should
watch for to fight against the deuyls till yt he had acomplysshed that which
Dauyd says in his psalm. Never says he in speaking of the deuyls. I shall
not cease till they be overcome. The which Request god granted him. And
this holy Pachomyen said / that the deuyls have no might over us / so that we
will resyst to their te^ptaco^ns / by mean of yt grace of god which we ought
to call upon. He said also yt many times he had herd ye deuyls when they
recou^ted their co^trouersyes togydre / and how on a time one of them said
these words. I give oftentimes wou^derful lettynges and great temptaco^ns unto
an hermyte / but as so soon yt I have give him one assawte / he casts
hy^self do^ne to ye earth and prays god / wherefore I am constrained to flee
away all co^fuse An other said. I hold a another in my puyssau^ce which
fulfylleth folysshly all ye wicked thoughts yt I set hy^ before. I make him
often to chyde and to braule and to make noise with his neighbors. I yield hy^
slothful to ye service of god. And therefore ye holy man Pachomyen said to
his brethern. I pray you my children / yt ye be always ready to call upon ye
grace of ye holy g^ost when any temptaco^n shall come upon you / and be
awaytyng in oryson / as ye postle gives counsel / and watch curyously in
doing of ye same. With this he warned them to have ever in their mind ye name
of Ihu^s. And after yt he had in trute taught them thus / they went ayene to
their houses / and never they spoke words in vain the one to the other / but
always of ye holy scripture / and pryncypally of those things yt moeued the^
to prayer / and to love and dread god.

Our lord gaf a synguler gift of grace to one of yt old holy faders / for
he saw wonderful things which his brethern might not see. When ye said
brethern dysputed together of ye holy scriptures / he saw ye angels yt assysted
about them. And to ye contrary when they devised of vain things / he saw ye
deuyls in lykenes of hegges playng among them / and took pleasure in their
words And his custom was at any time yt he saw such vysyon that he
withdraw himself in to his chamber / and there he wept full pyteously /
considering the myseryes and wretchydnesse in which ye devil puts us
through his subtyltees / decepco^ns and malycyouse temptaco^ns. And after he
went again to his brethern / which he exorted to flee vain words / and also
folysshe thoughts / in showing unto them / yt by the same we slay in us the
grace of god / and run in to his Indygnacyon / and of all the court of
paradyse. Morouer he said that he was certain yt as soon and incontyne^t that
we profer or within our thoug^te purpose for to do any thing dyshonest our good
angel departed from us / and Incontinent the had angel takes possessyon of
our soul. After he warned them yt they should not speak euermoche / saying yt
in habondau^ce of words / men may not eschew sin / and also the spyryte is
thereby more week to^ withstonde against ye wicked te^ptaco^ns In the palace of
Theodosius them perour was an holy man named Arsenye yt had two children / one
was called Archadius / and the other Honorius / the which were by ye said
emperor holden over the font stone. The good Arsenyen after yt he had in his
heart besyly considered ye estate of this world and ye vanytees of the same /
he forsook all and went to yt deserte of Sychye for to use there the remenau^t
of his life in being allone / and to be departed from ye worshypes of the
world. He being yet in ye world he was clothed most precyously of all other
yt were in ye palace seruyng yt emperor. And when he was in the said deserie /
he was yt man among the other that more pouerly and foully was arrayed Upon a
time wenyng to be in his chamber with many of his brethern / he herd a voice
yt said to hy^. Arsenye come out of thy chamber / and I shall show yt the
vain werky^ges of men. The which voice by hy^ herd / him seemed yt he lept
out of his habytaco^n / and incontyne^te he saw a great Ethyopyen yt hew wood
and gadred it in a hepe / and after yt he had gadred much of it / he trowed to
have lift it upon his back / but he could not / because there was to much of
it. Yet again he hew more thereof and set it upon the other. Syn after he
saw an other Ethyopyen yt took water out of a pound and put it in to a
vessel which was so full of holes that it might not hold no water which was
sypylled and went out at the holes. After he was brought at an other part
where he saw a great buyldyng like a Temple / before the which were two men
upon two horses and either of them bare a long perch upon their sholders / and
both togydre attones would have entered in the said Temple / but they might not
pass / withsta^dyng the lettynge of the said perches that they bare
ouerthward when they would have passed thrughe the gate. And another of them
would not meke him self to the other / but either of them would be the first
that should enter. The which vysyons were to hy^ by the said voice expowned in
the manner yt follows. First they that bare ye perches ouerthward / betokened
thoo yt have charge of relygyouses as abbottes and an other / the which in
their offices wexe proud and will not humble hy^self ye one toward the other
/ in despysynge the word of god that says. My childern learn of me / for I am
humble and sweet in heart / and by this mean ye shall find the salvation of
your souls. This proud folk by their pride abyden out of the church / and
come not in / that is to say / that they have no part in paradyse. He that
assembled the wood in a hepe / sygnefyeth those yt do many sins / and when
they trow for to return to do penance / they be so sore laden yt they can
not aplye themself to do any good / but be thereto slothful and neclygent /
whereby co^tynuelly they gader and Join sy^ne upon sy^ne / and fynably they be
dampened because that they will not leave their evil customs. That other ye
took the water out a pound and put it in a vessel full of holles / betokened
those yt do some good but nevertheless they do more of evil than of good /
whereby they lose their merit and consequently the felycyte eternal.

An other abbot named Danyell testyfyed of the said abbot Arsenyen / that he
aplyed him self gladly for to make baskettes of leaves of certain trees / to ye
which work he must have water for to wete his leaves / and often it happed
that the water wherewith he halpe himself stanke right sore / whereof his
habytacyon was infecte and marred / and nevertheless he would not cast a way ye
said water / but when there was little of it / he put more to the same / whereof
some of his brethern deed blame him / askyng why he cast not ye old water
away and took of the fresshe by it self. To whom he answered yt in time passed
he was wont to have in his chamber all manner of swetnesse and lycours smellyng
sweet by cause it should be sweet of smelly^g / wherefore instead of ye said
savors full sweet smellyng of yt which he had delyted long / he would have
other yt were rotyn and stynkyng to thentent yt he should not be repreued nor
shent to have lived in this world ouermoche deyntely / bryngyng again to this
purpose the horrible stenches and tourmentes of hell yt they yt be dampened do
feel / and ye hystorye of the wicked rich man ye lived here so deyntely / the
which is now buried in the pyete of hell.

An other brother demanded of him how he ought to make his orysons / saying
that for no prayer that he made he could not have a very nor steadfast
co^puncco^n / namely by cause he understood not ye scripture. The holy abbot
Arsenyen answered hy^ / yt they ye understand not ye holy scripture ought
contynuelly to pray god as well as the were great clerks / and gaf an exemple
of ye serpente yt herkeneth after ye voice of the enchau^tour / for all be it
yt he understands hy^ not / always he yeldeth himself subget to ye said
enchau^tour. Also they ye proferen ye holy words of ye faith of holy church /
all be it yt they understand no thing of it / always in saying them / they
chasse and put away by the virtue and strength of such holy worde^ / and ye
steadfast believe yt they have in god ye deuyls fro them / pryncypally because yt
the devil may not here ye holy words yt which have be said by the true
prophets and holy saints.

Sometime not far fro ye celle or habytaco^n of saint Machary was a murdre
done / of ye which iniustly was a sy^ple man accused / and when he saw yt by
auctoryte of ye Justice men would have take hy^ for ye said caas. He fled away
to the monasterye of saint Macharye. The officers ye pursued hy^ for to find
ye means to bring hy^ with them / said to ye Relygyouse / yt if he were not
yelde^ in their hands / they and their abbot Macharye should deye for it. And
because yt this Macharye wist not how to resyste / he required the sergeantes
yt they should bring him there as he yt had be murdered was buried / and they
did so. And then be made his prayer to god and anon he called ye deed
body / the which answered / here I am. Saint Macharye then adjured him /
that he should tell if he had be slain by him that men would take out of
his monasterye or no / whereat he answered nay / whereof tho same sergeantes
were sore meruaylled / and kneled before saint Macharye / and prayed him that
he would wit of the deed who had kylde him. The holy man answered that he would
not do it / for it suffysed him that the said Innocente should be delivered /
and that it aperteyned him not make the malefactor to be accused / the which
might do penance and save his soul. And by this yt is said above / it
appyreth enough that men of ye church ought not to accuse ne know of sinful
befall / at lest in manner that death follow not thereby.

A brother gave a grape of Rasyns to the said saint Macharye ye which he sent
to one of his brethern yt was syke / the syke send it to an other / and thus
consequently it was sent from celle to celle so much ye finally / he that
last received it sent it again unto Saint Macharye. The which when he knew
yt the said grape had be given and sent from one brother to the other / and
namely consyderyng yt the celles and habytaco^ns were sore far from each
other / he thanked god by synguler affection / of the great charytees which by
this he knew was among his Relygyouses.

Of him self it is written / that the devil for to deceive hy^ / transtygured
him like a monk / and came and knocked at his door saying. Macharye arise
and come with the other monks that long syn are in oryson. The holy man
knowing that it was the devil he answered to him. O false liar envy of
truth / what have you to do now to bring thy self with ye company of the
devout relygyouses which enforce them self for to pray god whereat the devil
answered to him. O Macharye you know not then how yt they never do pray
without us. Now come on thy way / and you salt see if I say truth or not.
Then saint Macharye set him self to oryson / and prayed god yt he would
show to him if it was truth yt the devil had told him. After he went to
the church where ye brethern said matyns / and incontinent yt he was within ye
church / he saw a multitude of deuyls as black as Ethyopyens or men of Inde
ye were with his relygyouses. To some they shette their eyes and to ye other
they closed ye mouth to the end yt they should not sing / and before ye other
yt after matyns set them self to oryson / ye said fendes for to keep them
therfro / they transfygured them self in diverse speces of women. And what
soever prayer that the said brethren made / thoo same fendes brought again
diverse fantasyes in to their minds Always some of them were much devout /
and in such wise they resysted against the temptacyons and mockynges above
said / that the said fendes tarried nor arrected not nyghe them / but went
away all confuse. Whenne Saint Macharye had seen this scorn or derysyon /
he began to syghe and to weep and made such an oryson to our lord. O my
redemptour I beseech the right humbly yt it will please the to give help and
socours to our poor souls / the which be all fulle of wicked deceyuynges.
After he called together all his Relygyouses and questyoned them of their
conscyences after that he had seen the deuylles tempte them when they were in
oryson. Some to him answered and said that they had be of purpose to forsake
their monasterye. And some said that they had be in will for to acomplysshe
the detestable sin of lecherye. And the other answered all after their
desires and affeccyons / where upon it is to be noted / that by the things
above said / we may know / that when our orysons be not made with seruent
deuoco^n toward god / this proceeds of ye deceytes yt the devil gives to us
/ wherefore we ought to enforce our self for to withstonde / and by this mean he
shall depart a way from us all confuse. For when ye thought by good cha^yte
is Joined unto god / it receives not such fantasyes and deceyt. And therefore
said ye psalmyste / yt his raynes / yt is to say his will and his strength were
full of deceytes / so yt he had no health. And it should not be doubted that we
yt be sinners may make any prayers unto god without Infynyte temptato^ns / by
cause yt when they come to us / we can not cast them fro us / but we take
thereat oumoch and mordynat da^pnable plesyrs

Here folowen certain salutary questyons yt ye holy faders made to each other
and begy^neth in latin. Quida^ frater.

For to mean and make there ye entendement / and also to learn it for to answer
shortly to ye questyons by manner of quolibet here underneath written / ye which
be much wholesome and profitable for ye salvation of the souls of the deuote
christian folk / as well Relygyouses as other ledyng ye life actyue and
co^templatyue / every person ought to see and to note in his heart ye said
questyons and answers upon them made as herafter follows The which men find
to have besp^ken by ye au^cyent holy faders / yt in their time were abbottes
Relygyouses and hermytes ledyng a life much wholesome and good. And without any
doubt among all other martyrdomes concerning ye souls saluaco^n ye same is
wou^derfull necessary and profitable to all persons / ye desire by good living
to syke ye way of saluaco^n. Then for to enter in this matre / be it noted
and known / yt sometime was a Relygyous yt demanded of his abbot named Syswyne
how he ought for to live in his hermitage / where at he answered / yt he should
ete bread and salt and drink water / for by this mean he should not need for
to fethe no^ make ready none other thing nor to go fro town to town for to
get his living. And also he should have by this better leyser to abide and
aply himself to contemplacyon.

An other questyoned the abbot Poemen how and when he ought to fast. The
which answered that the Relygyouses ought to fast ever and ete little with
the same he said yt tho that fast without to take any mete in.iij. or.iiij.
days during are demed to desire vain glory in this world / and yt it is
beter to fast in taky^g his repast every day ones soberly / yt is to wit yt men
shall take their dinner not to ye fylle of the belly / but so moderatly yt men
shall always have honger and thirst / as the old holy faders had the which
have led and continued such live.

The abbot Sylnam and a dyscyple of his named Zacharye entered one time within a
monasterye where they ete a little of the bretherns mete of the same monasterye
/ and as they would have departed after dinner / this Zacharye was a little a
thirst / but the said abbot told him. My friend it is fasting day / thou
may not drink. Zacharye answered / what my fader we have ete / wherefore
there is no dau^gyer. Ha said the abbot / the mete yt we have taken was of
necessyte. For nature must be nourysshed / but nevertheless we must keep our
fast.

Some other relygyouses went to the abbot Joseph at a place called Panephe
to the intent for to ask him counsel how they ought to receive the brethern
that should come see them / and if they should be glad of them in having
their trust upon them. But or that they had made to him this askyng / the
said abbot said to one his dyscyple. Meruaylle not thy self of that thou salt
see me do this day. Then he let make two settes for them that were come to
him / one at right hand / and the other at lift hand and made them to
sytte thereupon. And Incontinent he went to his celle and took a vestyment upon
him so old that he could not well were it And thus arrayed came and passed
before them. After he went again to his celle and took a another much honest and
passed again in likewise before them. Thyrdly he came before them in his daily
habyte / whereof the brethern and Relygyouses seeing the same they were sore
meruaylled. And anon he came and set him self betwixt them. And this done he
demanded of these Relygyouses if he was not changed for the dyuersyte of his
habytes / whereat they answered nay. So said again the said abbot Joseph. All
thus as I am not changed for to have taken diverse habytes / thus ye ought to
receive with gladness the brethern that shall come to you and to be merry with
them And after when ye shall be allone by your self / then shall ye mow
syghe and weep / and by this mean ye shall not be changed but of habytes /
so that your conscyences be not turned otherwise. Then the brethern
apperceyued / that he knew well their thoughts / wherefore they kept stylle
their questyon and asked him nothing / knowing that he had answered to it or
ever that it was proposed.

An other brother said that when a person is wont and naturelly desires to
ete much which he might well do / and he absteyneth him there fro to
maystrye his flesh. He gets more mede in this doing / than he yt eteth
little / and is naturelly content of little fode.

An other brother said that we ought for to ete agreably that which god
gives unto us without to have Regard to any other metes / and also we ought
to yield unto him graces of that that we may have. And for confyrmaco^n of the
same / he said that there was sometime an hermyte ye which to much
affectuously desired for (...) a truyte^s called But for to corr^^te his
inordynat appecyce he took one and set it before his eyes that he might see it
contynuelly and not to ete of it.

An other holy fader was so syke that he might not ete of any mete. So was he
desired of his dyscyple that he would be content that he should make him a
little pappe mixted with honny / which thing the holy fader granted unto him.
It is to wit that the said holy fader for all prouysyon had nombre but a little
honny / whereof sometime he ete. And also he had some oil for his light to be
made of / which ho^ny and oil were in two little pottes much like to each
other. So it happed yt his dyscyple in making his said pappe he took the pot
where in the oil was wenyng to him to have taken the other where in the honny
was / and of this oil sore stynknyge he powered in to the said pappe. And how
be it that by mean of the said oil the pappe was of an right evil taste /
nevertheless he ete twyes of it / and at the third time / he told him that
he might ete no more thereof / wherefore the dyscyple desyryng that he should ete
more of it. He said to him. Ha my fader it is so good / look I shall ete of
it with you. Then he took of the same for to ete of it / and thus doing he
knew that it was all stynkynge. Then he kneled before the holy fader and
cried him mercy saying. Alas my fader I am cause of thy death / alas why dydest
not tell me thereof. The abbot answered / my sone be not angry / if god had
would that I should have ete it god would have granted that (...) have taken
to it the honny and (...) the cite / The abbot Poemen said yt if Nabuzar (...)
the prince of the taken / that is to wit a sovereign (...) man in dressyng of
metes / had not come in Iherusalem / the Temple of god should not have be
bren^e by ^yre. That is to sayt / that if the desire of the sin of glotonye
is not put one in man / his spyryte may not be enflamed nor moeued to fight
against the devil.

Saint Macharye had of custom / that when he ete with his brethern / if men
presented him with (...) / he drank of it / but after for as many times that
he had dronken thereof / he absteyned him self by as many days that he drank
another water nor wyn. Notwithstanding he drank it Ioyously / hopyng that
afterward by abstynen^e such as it is said / he might therefore ^ere penance.
And for this cause his dyscyple knowing the great affection that he bare in
making the said abstynence / forbode that none should present him with wyn to
drink / sayng that the wine that he drank / was unto him by cause of the said
afflyccyon more cause of tourmente / than of substentacyon.

In a congregacyon or assemblee of Relygyouses etyng together flesh where the
abbot Theodore was / a Relygyouse among the other was there found that ete no
manner of mete. And by adventure because he had brought with him some oyno^s or
herbs which he would have ete with sa^^. He called one of them that served at
the table and said unto him. My sone I ete nothing that is ^^st nor soden / but
I pray the give me a little salt. The sovereign abbot of this assemble /
herynge the said brother / he said unto the servant / why gyuest yt him not
that he asks / when thou see that he eteth nothing Then the abbot
Theodore in rebukynge him by cause he had showed openly his abstynence / said
unto him. It had be better my brother that you had eten flesh in thy celle or
habytacyon / than that thou sholdest have said these words in the presence of
so many Relygyouses / gyuyng to know by the same words that rather he should
have absteyned him self from etynge of salt / than to show his abstynence /
which he ought to have kept secret. A brother in likewise came over to the
abbot Syluayn which dwelled in the montayn of Syna. He seeing that his
Relygyouses occupied themself to temporal works said to him. Fader abbot /
why suffrest you that the brethern work and apply themself to operacyons
worldly. Thou know well that it is written that Marye Magdalene has chosen
the best part for herself / that is to wit contemplacyon. The abbot heryng
these words / commanded that men should take to the said brother a book of
contemplacyon and that he should be shett within a chamber there
contemplatyuely for to apply him self to devout oryson. The which thing was
thus done / and the said Relygyouse was left within the said chamber all
allone tylle that eueryche of them had taken his refeccyon / wherefore he as
weary and noyouse to be there so long seeing that he was not called for to ete
/ he came to the abbot and asked him if he should not ete. The same abbot for
to repreue him of his folysshe repreyff / say to him. Thou art a man all
spyrytuall that has no need of mete nor drink maternall. With this the
brother yield him self all confuse knowing that he had done ill to have
repreued him as above it is said And then the holy fader said again unto
him. O brother thou know now that Marthe is necessary unto Marye and that
by Marthe Marye is praised. That is to say that the life contemplatyue has
need of the life actyue.

There were sometime two brethern Relygyouses / every of them had to name Johan.
One of them which was abbot and less than that other of stature tempted with
boost and vain glory / said to the most that he would led an angels life
/ and serve to god contynuelly without any other thing to do. So left he his
monasterye and all that he had and went to an hermytage where he kept him a
while / and syn Returned to his brother / and knocked at his door / his
brother asked who was there that knocked so. Whereat he answered that it was his
brother. That other keeping his door shette said there against. My brother is now
with the angels. it may not be that he should ha^^te with the men. So left he
him at his door all a hole night. And in the morning gyuyng to him entering
he said to him in this manner. My brother if you be a man / thou must labor /
otherwise you can not live. Then this other brother know his great hoo^
cryeng mercy to his brother / and took him to his work again.

An other brother was / that was sore subget to the sin of blasphemye / and
yt which right sorry for this vice went unto all the old faders yt he wist any
wherefore to declare unto them his my^de thereupon. But Incontinent yt he come to
them / he was so shamefast yt he durst not show his sin to them. So went
he oftentimes for this cause toward the abbot Poemen / and nevertheless he
came ayene without to tell him any thing thereof. But the said abbot seeing him
pensefull and malencolyouse / constrained him so yt he opened to him his courage
/ in saying unto him that he was right sorry yt he was thus enclyned to the said
sin of blasphemye. Then ye said holy fader cou^seylled him / that at all
times yt he should be tempted of it / he should resyste saying unto the devil.
Sathanas / thy blasphemye be it upon the / for I ought not to blame no body.
And by this mean / the said man resysted to the said temptacyon.

The abbot Moses said yt by four things ye person falls in pain
traueylle temptaco^n and great sykenesse. The first by Inordynat taking of mete
and drink. The second by over long sleep. The third by holdyng him self
idle. And the fourth by over curyousely to goo arrayed.

Also ye abbot Poemen said / yt even thus as they yt assyste any king or prince
/ ought to be ever ready armed and garnysshed with glayues for to keep and
defend his body from oppressyon and vyolence / in likewise ye soul of every
cryste^ man willing to serve god / ought always to be ready and garnysshed of
virtues for to withstand against ye devil. An other said yt like as tryakell
puts away ye venym / so oryson with fasting casts out and shoueth aba^ ye
foul thoughts and vain thynkynges.

The abbot Macharye alone dwelling in his celle / had under hy^ many
relygyouses which abode in diverse habytaco^ns one from another. Upon a time
as he went out of his monasterye / he met with the devil ye clothed was with
a garment made of lynnen clothe which was all full of holes / and at every
hole was ha^gyng a little pot full of water / when saint Macharye saw hy^.
he asked hy^ where he was bound for to go / whereat he answered yt he yede for
to tempte his Relygyouses. After he asked hy^ whereunto served ye said pot^
whereat he said yt it was for to give and present te^ptaco^ns unto ye
relygyouses / and yt if ye taste of one of ye vessels pleased not to one he
presented hy^ of an other and if ye second was not to hy^ agreeable he
presented hy^ yet a another / and this said ye devil went his way. Saint
Macharye tarried there till yt he came again which soon appeared for hy^. Then
ye said saint greted hy^ saying / you be saved. The devil then answered to
hy^ why flatarest you me when all yt other be cou^trarye to me and will not
fall unto my will. Then have yt no friends said saint Macharye / ye say
truth answered ye devil / but oonly one called Theopantus / yt which bowed
lightly to ye temptaco^ns yt I gave hy^. Anon after saint Machary departed and
went unto ye hermytage of ye said Theopa^tus And after that he had desired hy^
to resyste against ye te^ptaco^ns of ye devil / he desired hy^ for to fast unto
ye even were come / and yt when such deceyuynges should be presented unto hy^
/ he should heue up his ho^des toward heaven / and without hardness he should
have socours. Anon after returned saint Macharye and with ye devil he met
again / to whom he asked how the brothern fared / and he answered yt they did
evil for him / for there was not one yt would obey him any more. And namely
he said / yt he which was wont to turn there as he would have him / was
full changed and he might no more turn him from his good purpose.

An other Relygyouse yt which was co^tynuelly tempted with diverse temptacions
which he might not bear / came unto an other relygyouses / and asked hy^
counsel how he might resyste. He answered hy^ yt he had be never shamed or
sclau^dred / when he had understand his answered he was evil apayed with hit
and went unto an other to whom he said yt in askyng cou^seyl of an other he had
be sclau^dred because he had answered to him presu^ptuously and above kind.
The second blamed hy^ greatly saying yt the first had not told hy^ oonly yt he
had be never sclau^dred of the temptaco^ns of the devil / wherefore he sent
hy^ again to ye first. And after he was come to him again / he cried hy^ mercy
saying yt he had done amys of that he was departed from before hy^ without
reverence / and with this he prayed him yt he would expowne unto his answer
Then this first Relygyouse said unto hy^ / that never sith yt he was made
monk he had not taken his fylle of bread nor of water / wherefore he had not
obeyed ye devil. And therefore it ought to be noted yt an abstynent man / is
not so subget unto the fend of hell / as is a lykerouse gloton.

A brother questoned ye abbot Poemen of his thought for to wit how he should
rule them / the which answered unto him yt if he kept hy^ from fyllyng of belly
/ and his tongue from spekyng / yt he should never be idle and that his hope
should always be set upon god / certainly he should be saved.

Two brethern yt often were turned with vain thoughts came unto ye abbot
Helyas which when he saw them so fat / as he would have spoken to his
dyscyple he began to lawhe saying / certes brother I am ashamed that you art so
fat seen yt you art a monk. A color pale and white with lennesse wrapped in
humylyte is the honor of a monk. A woman virgyn of ye naco^n of Rome sore
dredyng god departed out of ye said cite and came to alexa^drye for to see ye
abbot Arsenyen. She being within the town of Alexandrye / the archebysshop
Theophyle wellecomed her with great honor / to whom she prayed yt he would do
so much of his grace yt she might speak with ye said abbot. The said
archebysshop made himself her supplycaco^n unto ye said Arsenye^ / to yt
which Request he would not grant. And when she wyste yt he should not come
to her / as a woman of great steadfastness / having her trust in god purposed
in herself for to go unto hy^ at his celle / and not far there from she
found hy^ walking / and Inco^tynent kneled before him. Then Arsenyen said
unto her / woman if you art come hither for to see my face oonly / look and
behold me al thy fylle. Thou ought not to take heed unto my body / but at
my vacacyon if it be good. The good virgyne durst not look up so much she
was ashamed. The abbot after rebuked her of yt she had come fro so far over
the sea for to see oonly a man mortal. And she answered to hy^ humbly I am not
come oonly for to see the / but because yt you shall remember me in thyn
oracions. The abbot answered. My friend I pray god yt I may never remember
the. When she had understand the answer of the holy fader / she went again to
ye cite for to have deyed for sorrow. The archebysshop comforted her saying yt
she ought not to anger herself / because yt many great men have be deceived and
begyled of women. The abbot Moses said. If a king will take a town for to be
brought unto his subgecco^n without slaughter of any person / late hy^ take a
way ye bread and the water or the vytaylles whereof the enhabytantes in hit do
live by. In like wise also the passions and pryckynges of the flesh are
brought under ^ote by fasting and abstynences.

A young man that was rich purposed him for to forsake the world. And how well
yt for to do this / he was goon in to a monasterye nevertheless his thy^ kings
and worldly thought would many times have withdraw hy^ therfro. On a time
among other / he being out of the said monasterye / the deuyls came about hy^
and moeued against him a great blast of wind and of dust for to have made him
aferde. But he was thereof more steadfast than before / for incontynente to the end
yt he should have none occasyon to think upon temporal things / he forsook
not oonly all his goods / but also his own vestyme^tes which he took of and
cast them away / and all naked went redely again to the said monasterye. But
in going thydrwarde / our lord that forgets not his true servants.
Inspyred one of the old Relygyouses of ye same monasterye saying unto him /
thou slothful man arise / and receive Ioyously my champyon. Which voice you
herd / the good Relygyouse rose up and yede against the other that was coming
all naked out of his clothes / and knowing the cause of his bareness wou^dred
him much and clothed him again with an habyte of a relygyouse. And when any
came to the old Relygyouse foresaid for to ask him counseyll of their affairs
/ he counseylled them as well as he could / and also he answered them upon the
questyons that they asked of him. But when men touched him of the nature of
forsakyng of the world he sent them to the young Relygyouse and said to them /
come not to me for to have counseylle of this matter / but goo to that young
Relygyouse. For I never did Retche nor came not unto his right large
forsakynge.

A man sometime was yt which forsakyng the world / had dealed one part of
his goods to the poor folk and the other part he kept for him / And after
he came to saint Anthonye for to have of hy^ the habyte of a monk. When saint
Anthonye had known him / or ever that he received him to be a monk / he
commanded him that he should goo unto the next cite / and yt he should
unclothe hy^s^lfe all naked and then bye some fresshe flesh at bocherye /
and that he should couere him therewith / and he did so / whereby it happed that
all the dogs and the birds followed him. And when they would have take the
said flesh / they bot in to the man's flesh. Fynably he came again to saint
Anthonye and said to hy^ Behold fair fader / how the dogs have tered my
skin all about for to obey to thy co^mau^demente. Then said saint
Anthonye. My friend all they that forsaken the world and will have money /
they shall be thus tered and bytten by the deuyls of hell.

An other brother there was that took counsel of an holy fader / if he should
keep two shelynge that he had spared for to help himself at his need if he
were syke. The holy fader seeing that he would have feign kept ye said two
shelyng / he answered to him / ye / After that he was gone again to his house
/ he was aferde that the holy fader had answered him so for to fulfill his
will / wherefore he went again to him / and questyoned him as he had done
before. Then the holy fader answered him / that he was not wise for to set
his trust upon two shelyng and that if he were syke / god should purueye for
his sickness / for his goodness is so great that he leueth never his
servants in time of need.

A monk there was that no thing had of the world but a book of gospelles
which he should for to give to the poor for gods sake / saying to him
self. I have sold that that counseylled me day by day / to selle all that
men have and give it unto poor folk / because yt the same words were written
in the said book of gospelles that he had should.

A rich man sometime offered in pure gift all his money unto the abbot Agathon
/ besechyng him that he would take it / but he refused it. That other pursued
him still prayeng / if he would not take his silver for him self that he at
the least should take it for to be dystrybued by hy^ unto to the poor folk.
Then answered he that he should do two euylles / the first should be / for he
should receive the money whereof he had naught to do / seen that he gate his
living by labor of his own hands / and the second evil should be / that
in dealyng of the same he might hap to fall in the sin of vain glory.

Saint Powle the hermyte right worship among the holy faders of Egypt /
said that a Relygyouse when he wylleth or desires to have any thing ouermoche
more than him need is for to live upon / he is constrained for to goo out of
his monasterye / and in goyeng therout he fyndeth him lightly begyled of the
devil. The which thing considering the said Saint Powle / during one lent
he absteyned him from gooyng out of his celle / all be it that he had not for
all prouysyon but a little lentylle and raser of otemele and a little vessel
with water for to make some podage withal. And for to eschew the evil
thoughts that he might have had in desyryng other things unprofitable / also
to the end that he might more stedfastely abide within his said celle set
himself for to make mattes. And when they were weuen / he brake them in pieces
/ and syn made them again / and had lever do so / than to goo out of his
lodgys / for to fette more matter to make other mattes withal / dredynge the
temptacyons and decepcions of the devil that might have had come to him in
goyeng out / whereby it is to us showed euydently / that there nys no thing more
contrary nor more hurtefull to the salvation of a Relygyouse / than for to
desire more than to his pouere life needs / and also to go out of his
monasterye and hau^te among the worldly people.

The abbot Macharye being in Egypt found a thief that bare a way his goods
that he had in his chamber. And when he saw that he robbed him / he as a
stranger halpe him for to bear them away / saying such words or like. God
has given them unto us / he may take them again as he will / his will be
done with them / and his name be praised and blessed in all things.

An other brother went often for to vysyte and to see a holy fader a very
old man of whom he s^ale his bread. The holy man supposyng that this other
had need of it repreued him not therefore whereof it happed that this old fader
fall in so great necessyte / that he had no bread at all for to ete.
Finally tendynge to dethwarde / and seeing that his last day drew nyghe / he
sent for the thief that so often had robbed him before that / and kyst his
hands saying. Blessed be thy hands / for by them I trust for to come in
paradyse. After the same time the thief led a holy life and was parfyte in
virtuous works and in all his deeds.

The abbot Agathon proceeded in all his deeds by sovereign prudence / and as well
in werkynge and labourynge with his hands / as also in vestymentes / and in
all other things he kept the myddell assyse. His vestymentes were such that
they never appyered another to good no to badde.

Ire or wrath after that a holy fader says begins by four things. The
first by inordynat apetyte to give / and by brennyng couetyse to take. The
second when one is obstynate in his opinion. The third when men desire to be
honored. And the fourth when one thinks himself more wise than all other /
whereby he will here a rule among them. Ire also by four manners blyndeth the
wit of man. First when one owes ylle will to his neighbor. Secondely when
he has an envy of the honors and goods that his neighbor has. Thyrdly
when men take debate for a thing of naught. The fourth manner is when men
^acbyte his even christian. And to the contrary by four manners / men may
resyste to the passions that moeue a man to ire. First where as men can not
resyste / but that ire shall enter in to the heart / which is the first thing
where of men ought to beware / they must eschew it and keep that it come not
unto the face / and if the vysage makeh any show thereof / then must the
tongue be refrayned that she speak another Iniurye nor blame / and if the tongue
by great passion of ire prononceth any rygorouse word / men ought to beware
that after that they proceed not to the way of the deed. Three degrees are
among the men that touch to the passion named Ire. The first is when some
man endures pacyently all Iniuryes / he forgyueth lightly the person that
says evil by him. And this man follows the nature of Ihesu Christ. The
second when a man will not Iniurye no body / and also he will not be
Iniuryed. And this man is of the kind of Adam. And the third when a man
Iniuryeth and hyndreth an other body / and the same is of the nature of the
devil. A Relygyouse was some time Iniuryed of an other / wherefore he went
unto the abbot Sysonyen for to complain him of the said Iniurye that had be
done to him. And how well that the said abbot showed unto him that for the
love of god he ought to forbere lightly ye said Iniurye / prayeng him that he
should do so putting the vengaunce in the hand of god / nevertheless he
would not thereof / wherefore the abbot seeing his obstynate mind / desired him
to pray god with him that he would take a way from hy^ this wicked
obstynacyon. Syn after this abbot made such an oryson unto our lord saying. O
my god have pity of the Indygnacyon of this brother here. For it seems to hy^
by his words / yt we have naught to do of thy help / for as much that he
says that of himself and by his might he can be avenged. Then the brother
herynge his prayer / kneled done before the said abbot and cried him mercy. An
other in likewise co^playned him to the said abbot of certain Iniurye that was
done to him. And he told him yt he should take it pacyently and yt a man is
never Iniuryed / but only for his sins / and therefore we ought to answer to
them yt speak any harm against us. My friend it is for my sins that you
spekest so many Iniuryes toward me and for to correct me / wherefore I thank
the.

The abbot Poemen said to his dyscyples. My brethern I pray you for your
synguler saluaco^n ye malice overcome never your will / but when any body
shall do to you any evil / yield him good there against / to the end that by
doing of good ye overcome the evil. To this purpose is reherced of a
relygyouse the more that he was spoken ylle the gladder he was for it saying.
They that Iniurye us are cause of our perfeccyon / always provided that we
have good pacyence / but they that speak to us fair words and sweet as done
flaterers / they are unto us the cause of our loss. For it is written / who
that shall bless you / certainly he shall deceive you.

An other aeged holy fader was sometime the which when any of his neyghebours
had done to him any Iniurye / he hasted him self as much as he could to
reward them with some good therefore. And if the person that so had
Iniuryed him / was dwelling far from him / he sent unto him some gifts.

An other went for to have couseyll of the abbot Sysonyn / if any thieves came
in his house that would slay him / and that he were of the stronger side / to
wit if he should put himself against them for to slay them or no. Whereat ye
abbot answered yt he should kept him well therfro / but should late god do.
For what soever happeth to us / it is for the punycyon of our sins. So ought
we to give all unto the godly dysposyng of Ihesu christ. To this purpose it is
found / that certain thieves went toward a holy hermyte / and forced them
for to do him harm by vyolence. The which hermyte for to eschew their evil
intent began to cry And then the other hermytes his neighbors ran to his
socours and took the said thieves / and sent them to the officers of the
Justice / the which kept them long in prison. The relygyouses that were
thereof informed were wonderfully wroth that they were not otherwise punysshed.
So went they to the abbot Poemen and showed him the caas. This abbot wrote
unto the hermyte in rebukyng him that he had not with him the virtue of
suffrau^ce. The hermyte for because of this was long time in his celle or
little house that he went not out of it. And fynably being sorry of the long
emprysonement of the said thieves he went to the prison / and openly delivered
them out of the same.

The dyscyple of a philosopher / for certain offense by him made moeued the
same philosopher his master to so great wrath against him / that he told him
/ he should never pardonne him / till that he had endured and borne by the
space of three year all the Iniuryes of his felawes / which thing he did so.
And at the end of the said three year this dyscyple came to his master again and
asked him forgyuenes. And he told hy^ as in feryng him yt he should never
pardone him unto ye time yt he yet by the space of other three year should have
given certain gifts to those yt scorned and did hy^ evil. The dyscyple
suffered yet three year / and when they were come at an end / he came again unto
his master as he had done before / which brought hy^ unto Athenes for to
learn phylosophie. Then was there at ye gate of ye cite an old philosopher /
yt made great Iniuryes to them yt would have gone within for to preue their
pacyen^e. This odle philosopher then seeing ye said disciple yt would have
entered within ye town for to study there in phylosophye / casted at hy^ many
proud mockes and shameful words. And because yt he suffered them pacyently
without to trouble hy^self withal / ye enter of ye cite of Athenes foresaid was
granted unto hy^ without any great labor. By this gate may be understand ye
gate of paradyse / through which men may not pass for to seek ye glory of
heaven without yt they endure many Iniuryes An hermyte asked an holy fader how
he should get heaven / whereat he answered yt more lightly he might not come
thereat than for to have pacyence in his troubles and Iniuryes / and yt if men
do to him many / he should have more mede in suffryng of them / than in doing
of any other penance.

The abbot Moses was desired by certain Relygyouses yt he would show unto
them some good ensa^ples for to save their souls. And he commanded his
dyscyple Zacharye yt he should tell them some what. This dyscyple then did
put of his habyt and tradde it with his fete / saying yt a man might not be nor
ought not to be a monk but if he were in likewise tradde and tormented with
diverse aduersytees and troubles. The abbot Macharye said yt he is a very
relygyouse yt in ouercomynge himself brings under his own passions. None
also ought not to lose hy^ self for to save an other / and therefore any man
ought not to a^gre his neighbor for to preue his patience / for it happeth
ofte^tymes yt a body in moeuy^g of some other / he falls in to ye sin of
ire. Where certain relygyouses in ye presence of saint Anthony / did praise an
other brother and his virtues / saint Anthony after his praysy^g made unto hy^
some Iniuryes for to preue his pacyence / the which Iniuryes he might not
endure Then said saint Anthony / yt he was like ye houses yt have fair enter
and strong but ye thieves may come in lightly at the back side.

Some brethern asked of the abbot Ysaac wherefore was yt ye deuyls fered hy^ so
much / and he a^swered ye sith yt he was made religious he was never a^gry in
hy^ self / whereby ye deuyls had hy^ in a dread A Relygyouse came ones to ye
abbot Achyles which casted blood out of his mouth. The relygyouse seeing ye
same asked him whereof proceeded this sykenesse / whereat the abbot answered yt
folk had reported some words to him whereof he was angry / but
notwithstanding he would not show it. So had he prayed our lord yt he would
take away yt wrath from him / and for this cause by mean of ye same prayer he
casted blood out of his mouth which was cause of the sleeyng of his wrath.

Diverse brethern came to a holy hermyte / and as they where come nyghe his
hermytage / they found shepardes that sang dyshonest songs And when they were
within the celle of the said hermyte / they asked him why he corrected not the
said shepardes. And he answered to them yt he had be in will full often for to do
so / but he considered yt if he could not resyste to ye te^ptacions yt should
hap to come to hy^ by mean of such songs / he should with great pain mow
withstand to other te^ptacyons more great. To this purpose he said / yt he yt
shall not conne refrain his tongue against his wrath. In likewise with great
hardness he shall bear the moeuynges and pryckynges of the flesh.

The abbot Johan being with all his Religyouses / they showed unto hy^ one
after an other their thoughts / save one that said by envy. O Johan my
brethern do as the common wy^men that utter swetly their words for to get
love of their bylouers. To whom the said abbot answered yt his word was true.
The said brother more moeued with envy than before / said again to the said
abbot / yt his body was all full of venym / whereat he answered. If you know
that yt is within my body as well as ye do that that is without you sholdest
se therein much more deuyls than thou spekest of.

In Egypt was a Relygyouse sore reno^med / the which for his great reno^mee /
almoost all they of the Regyon were wont for to vysyte him. During his said
reno^mee / the abbot Poemen came out of Sychye for to dwell within the said
land of Egypt. So many one left the vysytyng of ye said Relygyouse for to go
toward the said Poemen / whereof the said Relygyouse becam much enuyouse. The
abbot Poemen knowing this brother to be ylle content of ye men did more of
reverence to this Poemen / than to him which so long time had be so famous
within the said land / was full sorry and heavy of yt he was cause of his anger.
So gadred he all his Relygyouses togydre with him / and went for to vysyte
and see the said brother yt which would not open his door to them at ye first
but because he saw yt the said Poemen was in his opinion prayeng yt he would
make him openyng / he made him with his felawes to come in. And after kyssed
each other / and were at the same hour very friends togydre / so yt the said
Relygyouse said unto saint Poemen yt he was of much more perfeccyon than he
had herd tell.

An abbot named Mutues made a celle some time in a place called Eracloena where
so great envy was upon him of many one yt he was constrained for to depart
out of it. So went be to a another place where in likewise he made a another
dwelling place for him self to dwell in / and as a fore / he was there sore
enuyed of a Relygyouse / whereof he was constrained to go there out as he was
fro the other. So went he again to the place from whens he was departed first
and shette himself within his celle. After this the hermytes neighbors to the
same place of whens he was departed fro gadred them self togydre and took the
said brother enuyer of the said abbot Mutues for to bring him toward him.
And when they were come nyghe his hermytage / they left the said brother in a
place nyghe enough to the same with ye skynnes wherewith they were clothed /
and this done they went for to speak with ye said abbot. And when they were
come at hy^ / he opened his wyndowe for to spek to them and asked of them where
their melotes were / yt is to say their habytes made of skynnes yt they were
wont to be clothed withal / whereat they said / yt they had left them not
far fro thens with the brother yt had be enuyouse over hy^. He brake then^e
open his door with an axe and ran toward the said brother yt which colled
and kyssed in sign of peace. And after he brought them to his celle and ete
with them / notwithstanding yt he was not wont for to ete nor drink at
such an hour as that was. And finally he returned again with them.

The abbot Agathon said that he never had slept while that he had any
questyon with some till that he was reconsyled with him. In like wise he
suffered never no Relygyouses to sleep in their obstynacyon that had noise or
debate one against the other / till that they were peased.

Two brethern were in an hermytage which had never debate togydre It happed
so that the one said to that other. My brother I pray the that we may have
some questyon togydre as other have. That other said that he wist not what
noise was. Ha sire said his felawe I shall learn the how we shall chyde and
fall out togydre. I shall set a tyle between us both / and then I shall
say that it is mine own / and thou shalt say that it is thine own / and by
this mean we shall have stryffes togydre. They did put this tyle betwix
them both / and that done / one of them said / this tyle is to me belonging /
that other answered I hope it is mine. The first said nay / it should be for
him. The other answered / if it be thine then take it and bear it with the.
And thus they could not have no strife togydre.

Saint Macharye being in his prayers he herd a voice that said. Macharye
thou rechest not yet unto the holiness of two wy^men that are in the next
cite. This holy man after this voice y herd / went forthwith to the said cite
/ and so long he sought after them that he found them. He was received of
them gladly enough. After he questyoned them of their astate and conuersaco^n
where of their were sore abashed because they had sayen every night with
their husbondes. Notwithstanding the holy fader questyoned them more
desyryngly / and so that they were constrained to tell him their
conuersacyon. They first of all said to him that they had no sybbe or
kyndrede togydre / but oonly of that their husbondes were brethern germayn /
with the which and by the space of.xv. year they had togydre both of them
used their live without to speak any foul word the one to the other / and
without never to have had any debate or strife / but during the said time they
had lived in peace togydre / with this they had purposed syn long time agoo
to enter in Relygyon / and so they should have do if their husbondes would have
granted thereto. And seeing that they would not be content that they should do
so / they had lived with their husbondes the best and most honest life that
they could in dyspysyng all temporal things / and desyryng only the
spyrytuall things. The holy hermyte seeing their honest life / he began to
say thus. Certainly god accepts not more the virgynes nor the wedded wives
than the monks seculer / but oonly he asks the good purpose to be steadfast
in him and in his commandments. For of his goodness to al astates he gives
inspyraco^n to lead a life / whereby every person may purchase paradyse.

A brother there was yt could never have peace with the other relygyouses / so
purposed he for to go dwell alone in an hermytage / to the end he might be in
rest / and yt no body might anger no moeue hy^ for to laugh / fynably he went
in to a great cave where he dwelled alone It happed one day yt he filled a
vessel with water and set it on ye ground / yt which vessel forth with
turned the botom vpsodo^ne not ones oonly but three times / and at every time
he filled it again. And seeing that he could not make him stand on the earth he
brake it for dyspyte in pieces. And then he knew that as well when he should
be allone / the devil that angered him in Relygyon / might also trouble him in
solytary place. So returned he to his monasterye / saying that it was
necessary for to work and have pacyence / and to ask the help of god
without which any virtue we can not come to.

Saint Macharye told of himself that he being young and dwelling in an
hermytage / he was compelled by force to serve in the cite as clerk /
nevertheless he would not dwell there / but always went again to his
hermytage. It happed the same time yt the daughter of a seculer was great with
child. Her parents yt saw this asked her of whom it was / she answered that
ye hermyte Macharye had done the deed. Her said kynnesmen then went to
the hermytage of the said Macharye and took and beat him and henge pottes at
his ne^ke saying / here is ye worthy hermyte that has defiled our daughter /
with that came there an aeged holy fader which repreued them sharply because
that they had so sore beten him that he was all most deed. And they that had
the devil with them answered to him again. Thou see the shame that he has
done to us / thou barest witness of his truth / but it is now well known yt
he is a very ypocryte. Wit it that we shall never leave him in peace / till
that some body shall have given for hy^ to our daughter lawful prouysyon for
her living. The said Macharye had a servant at that time that bare to the
town his ma^^des and baskettes for to be sold whereupon he lived / to whom
for to eschew the hands of ye said tyrauntes / he commanded that he should
selle all for to nourysshe ye said daughter. And from that time forthon / the
p^ore hermyte was constrained to watch daily and nyghtely for to get the said
woman's living / and said unto himself. Now Macharye work well / for thou have
a wife and a child which thou must find / wherefore thou shalt now labor
more than thou dydest before. But the holy hermyte awayted ever you god should
help him. The time came that the said daughter should be delivered of her
fruit where she was long in great martyrdom with thrawes without comparyson.
The matrones or myddewyfes yt were come to her for to receive the child /
questyoned her and asked her whereof it came yt she might not be delivered of
her child. Then ye poor sinner confessed her sy^ne and said that it was
because ye falsely she had accused ye poor hermyte / for she was with child by a
neighbor of hers a young man. And when this thing was come unto ye ^eres of him
yt brough the fode as well to ye said Macharye as to ye said daughter / he ran
apas toward hy^ and telled hy^ these tidings / whereof saint Macharye gaaf
praysynges and graces unto our lord / and fro thens he departed for to go in to
Sychye / where he lived long time in doing great penau^ces. A brother asked of
the abbot Poemen / what thing he might do for to eschew ire and sadness /
whereat he answered / that he should not dysprayse / nor Judge / nor also
bachytte any person / and if he kept hem therfro / our lord should give him
rest.

The abbot Poemen said of saint Ysodore abbot yt he oonly more than any other
truly knew his one self / for when he had any thoughts or Illusyons yt he
was an holy man / he answered to him self. Alas I am not such as Anthonye was
or ye abbot Pando or the other faders yt have be lovers of god By this mean he
lost his fa^tasye which presumed hy^ over high / when the deuyls said to hy^.
Abbot you have good to do penance / for after that you shall have lived well in
great sharpness / thou shall descend in to hell. He answered unto them. Yet
no force if I descend there. I hope I shall not be brought in to the deppest
part thereof. For ye shall be under me. The deuyls said often to the abbot
Moses yt they could never make him to fall. for when they ^rowed for to have
brought hy^ done by despyraco^n / he was areysed to god ward. And when they
wend to have enhaunsed hy^ by pride he brought him self done by humylyte /
and by this mean he brought the deuyls under foot.

A brother questyoned ones ye abbot Sysonin asking of hy^ counsel what he
should do of yt he was fallen in to sin. The abbot answered to hy^ yt he
should put pain for to arise again. And he said there against / yt he had
araysed hy^ self ones / but he was fallen again. The said abbot answered as
had done before. And again by many times the said brother told him yt often times
he was fall and as many time he had arysen again by penance. So answered unto
hy^ ye said abbot yt he should not cesse to arise himself again inco^tynent yt
he were by sy^ne ouerthrawen And where ye said brother asked of hy^ unto how
many times he should rise again / ye abbot answered unto yt time yt in good or
evil work you shall decesse / for in ye astate as ye man shall be caught by death
/ in ye astate shall he be Iuged. An other was tempted of certain sin by ye
space of.x. year / and because he could no more withstonde / as dysperate he
would go out of his hermytage to the world again. Then came unto hy^ a voice
yt said. O man for to reco^pense yt of you.x. year in which you have myghtly
fought / wit yt you shall have you crown of vyctorye. By this it appyreth to us
/ yt we ought to co^tynue unto the end / for the more euylles yt we have / the
gretter glory shall we receive. After this he went again to his hermytage and
had no more the said temptacyons.

The abbot Anthonye being in his hermytage was tempted long of slouthe and of
ydelnesse / so said he to god. My god I desire to be saved / but the diverse
thoughts that come upon me will not consent theru^to / wherefore my lord teache
me what I ought to do for my saluaco^n. And soon after this he saw a man like
him as him seemed / that weued a rope / and after arose from his work and made
devout prayers. Such a vysyon happed to saint Anthonye. Now men may belyue /
that it was an angel that showed how a body may withstand to his passions.
For when saint Anthonye saw this vysyon / the angel said unto him Anthonye do
as I do / and you shall be saved the said abbot when he had seen ye said techyng
he was comforted / and in time after he did as he had ye angel see do. An
other asked counsel to an aeged fader what he should make because he could no
manner of craft / but oonly ete and drink and sleep / and from hour to hour /
and from one thought to a another passing a way the time. The old fader
cou^seylled him that he should keep him in his chamber for the love of god and
that he should do that him possible was after his understanding without to
trouble ne let his fantasye with curyouse thoughts / and that without fault
he should have Joy like to saint Anthonye.

An other asked to the abbot Achylles whereof came that he being in his ^elle /
he had no will for to do any good work for his soul. Achylles answered to him
/ that it was because he had not seen the Joys of paradyse nor also the
tourmentes of hell / and that if his chamber had be so full of worms and of
felthe that he were there sowced unto the neck / so that his affection were
let for to think upon the tourmentes of hell / yet should he abide therein
and work there by great dylygence. An other Relygyouse demanded of saint
Anthonye what thing he should keep for to please god withal / whereat he
answered / that what someuer thing that he should do / were it going or
coming / he should ever have god in his thought with the exemples and
doctrynes of holy scripture / and with this where so ever that he should cast
him to abide he should not depart therfrom suddenly / but what someuer trouble
yt he had there / he should steadfastly keep himself at it / saying that in
keeping these three things / he should be saved. An other Relygyouse desired
the abbot Moses that he would give him some good sore / the which answered to
him / that he should go to his celle or little house / for she should learn hy^
all that he must do so yt he would co^tynue therein his dwelling place. And he
said also / that like as the fysshe deyeth inco^tynent that men take out of the
water also peryssheth the relygyouse when he is out of his cloystre.

A brother asked to ye abbot Poemen if he should do bester his salvation in
keeping him self all alone in his hermytage or some other solytary place / than
to dwell among company. The which abbot answered unto him / yt a man which
of himself will be corrected may well dwell every where / but he yt by pride
will enhaunse himself can not abide in no place / for it is written / he yt
thinks himself to be worth any thing where he is naught / he dysceyueth
hy^self. In likewise who yt boosteth him of some good deed / if he does it /
he leseth his mede.

A brother of Egypt came ones to the abbot Zenon in Syrye / ye which accused
hy^self of many sins. The said abbot hery^g his words was sore merueyled
saying / ye egypcyens hydde^ their ^tues and show ye vices which they have
not / but ye syrye^s and greeks auau^ce them self of virtues yt are not in them
and hyd their own sins.

An old holy fader said / yt he yt is sore praised and worshyped of ye world
leseth ye merit of his soul / and by such praysy^ges he falls in vain
glory. And he yt is scorned of the world shall have great reward of god. Yet
said he more that like as it is Impossyble that the herb and the sede should
come kyndely both attones / also it is Impossyble to have the glory of this
world and the Joy of heaven together. Item al thus as a tresour which is
known mynusheth and wexeth little / so does ye virtue when it is known by him
yt does it. Item as the wax fleteth before the fire / so the soul in this
world y praised taking thereat her reioycyng leseth her fayrenesse. When the
thinking of pride or vain glory befyghteth us by demyng that we be good / we
ought to seek in our conscyences if we have kept all the commandments of
god and loved our enemies. If we have not be glad when our adversaries have
had loss of goods / and whether we have been wrote of their getynges. Then
shall we see that we did never no good. And by the same we shall eschew this
folysshe presumpcyon to trow to be good.

A holy fader after he was come for to see his fellow he said unto hy^. Brother
I am all ready deed in the world. His felawe answered unto him. My friend trust
on thy self till that time that thy soul shall depart out of thy body / for
if you art deed / the devil therefore is not so / the which has without no^bre
crafts and subtyl for to deceive us An other holy fader was that had lived
fyfty year without bread and ete no thing but rotys and drank a little water.
He said ones to his felawes. My brethern I thank god of yt he gives my grace
that I can eschew fornycacyon / vain glory / and auaryce. The abbot Abraham
herynge these words came unto him / and asked him if by adventure he found a
woman in his celle whether he might well keep him to think yt she were there.
He answered nay / but he should never consent to have her company. Then said
Abraham / fornycaco^n is not deed yet in the but oonly it is bound by ye will
of god for it is possible that you might sin in it. In likewise he questyoned
hy^ of couetyse / asking to him if he seeing some gold among some stones
should mow keep hy^ from thynkyng yt it were gold / so answered he nay / but
he should not have apetyt to take it. Thyrdly he asked hy^ if two men / of
which the one hated hy^ / and ye other loved hy^ / came to his house / whether
he should receive them y like. He answered nay / but he should co^strayne his
will for to do as good chere to the one as to the other. And what by these
questyons / as by his answers / the holy fader Abraham showed him clearly /
that our passions be never deed / but oonly are bounden. For unto the last
article of the death we all are in puyssaunce to do sin / wherefore we ought
not to praise our self.

An old hermyte dwelled in a desert wounderfull low / and with him hau^ted
full often a seculer man for to serve him yt had a child which in certain time
fell syk / yt which thing seeing his fader he prayed ye said holy man yt he
would go unto his house for to see his childer to the end yt by his prayers he
might be made hole. This holy hermyte granted hy^ his request and went with
hy^ / when they came nyghe the said house / the fader of the child commanded
that men should come against the holy man with lamps and torches. The hermyte
seeing the great honor that men did unto him / he unclothed himself all naked
and began for to wasshe his clothes in a water. Then the fader of the child
said to them that came against him Turn again home turn again I see well that
our holy man has lost his entendement. After he asked him the cause why in
the presence of so many folk he had done so great a folly / saying that they
should wene that he were from his wit and full of the devil. Then answered
the hermyte that none other thing he would not here. A great lord that was
Judge of the prouynce where dwelled ye abbot Moses would goo see him. When
Moses knew it / he fled away / and as by hap he met with the said lord
by ye way which asked him where dwelled the abbot Moses. He answered him /
why he sought about for to see a fool and a wicked heretyke. The Judge then
went again to the church and said to the clerks how he had met an hermyte
that had said unto him that ye abbot Moses was but an heretyke. Then the
clerks asked him what manner a man it was that he had seen. He said it was a
man great and black and sore old and clothed with foul habytes. Then they
knew that it was he whereof the Judge was sore on angered and went his way for
dyspyte.

The abbot Sysoyns dwelling in the mo^tayne where saint Anthonye was buried /
a good man acompanyed with a child of his went there for to see him and for
to receive his blessing. It happed by the will of god that his child deyed by
the way / whereof nevertheless the fader angered not him self / but taking his
Infortune pacyently / he bare his child deed to ye celle or little house of
the said abbot. And as he came in he found him in his prayers. So did he sprede
before his fete his said child / and he him self kneled before him on his
knees / castyng him self to the earth / as they that asked to the holy faders
their blessyng were wou^^e for to do. And after that he had made his oryson /
he went out of the celle of the said holy fader leuyng his child there. And
so it happed that the holy fader foresaid tendyng still to his prayers and
contemplaco^ns / had not seen the said good man / or at lest had not spoken
to him / in tournyng him self a back he saw the child thus cast before him
as before is said / and wenyng that he had be thus prayeng unto god He say unto
him such words / arise my sone and go after thy fader. And Incontinent after
these words / the child meruayllously arose and went toward his fader /
which seeing him alive again was soueraynly meruaylled / and knowing ye
grace that god had done to him / he gaaf to him graces and than kings. And
also came and thanked the said abbot that wist no thing thereof whereof he
received not unto him the worship nor the glory / but he was full sorry to here
tell of such things / ^o^^tyng that the noise that might arise thereby should
be cause to make him fall in to the sin of vain glory / wherefore expressly
he defended unto the said good man yt he should never tell nothing of it at
lest till after his death. A seculer man taken of the devil was brought sometime
in to a church where were many monks / the which made togydre their prayers
for him / but nevertheless the devil would not leave him. So were they
purposed for to desire their abbot Besaryon that he should pray for him / but
they were yet in a dyffyculte / saying that if they should go tell him this in
his chamber / he should not come to the church / wherefore beryng this man
toward hy^ they did set him done by the way where their said abbot
should come / and began again togydre for to pray god for the said man. And
when the said abbot should have passed by each of them began for to call and
cry. O fader abbot awake this man. Incontinent the holy man making over him
the sign of the cross commanded him yt he should arise and go out of the
way / and he did so.

An other was in Egypt that had a child which had the palsy / the which as
the pleasyr of god was / he took and bare him unto the celle of saint Besaryon
/ and sore weeping left him at the ^ore. This done the child began to weep and
weyle. And the holy man that looked out at the wyndowe saw him and said. My
child who has brought the there / whereat the child answered. Sire it was my
fader that has left me here. Then saint Besaryon said to him / stand up my
sone and goo after him / and anon with good health he departed and went after
his fader. The abbot Mutues said / that the more that a man denies him self a
great sinner / he is without comparacyon much more parfyt and more next god
than the other be that do not so. And to this purpose Ysaye saying / god
called him self wretchyd and abhomynable sinner / we have in this world but
care / and contynuelly in danger to fall. Also it is written he that is up /
lat him beware of a fall / we row in the sea / ever in danger to be
perysshed. Morouer he said that they that are in solytarye places row in
sauete as lyghtned with the son of ryghtwysnesse. And they that are in the
world row in danger / that is to wit for doubt of the night / that
betokens unknowing / but not withsta^dynge it happeth often to them that be
seculers / how be it that they row in the derkenesse of the night / that is to
wit among the wretchydnesse and worldly troubles / that their ship comes
to port salve. And they that be in relygyon because that they be assured as
them seems / if they become neclygent and proud / they leave their good styre
and ruler / that is to wit meekness / whereof it happeth sometime that their
ship is drowned in the sea. And right so as it is Impossyble a ship to be
sure without nails / also it is Impossyble to be saved without meekness
which is never angry / nor will never consent that an other shall be angry.
Meekness is to forgive him that has trespasseth against us before that he
repents / that is to say as soon as he has done to us any shame Iniurye or
wrong.

The abbot Macharye ones well erly did fette leaves of a lawrer tree for to
make mattes withal. And as he came homewarde again he met ye devil yt bare a
sharp secle wherewith he wend to have stryke at him / but he could not. And
after as for great dyspyte he cried loud and said. O Machary thou gyuest me
much tourment / when I wene for to trouble and hurt the I can not / and yet
always I go beyond the in all works / for thou etest and drynkest which I
do never so. Thou spekest sometime / and I have never lust to do so
Nevertheless thou set me under so to in one thing / that is in meekness.
Then the holy fader did set him self to oryson / and the dampened spyryte
did vanysshe away.

A man that taken was of the devil smotte ones one of the holy faders of Egypt
in the face upon his ^o cheke. And Incontynente the holy fader proffred him his
other cheke for to receive an other stroke of him. The devil seeing his
meekness might not endure the same and went out of the said like man's body.

An other holy fader said that all the virtues that a Relygyouse might
perfo^me / without humilyte they can not prouffyte him nothing. For humylyte is
the message^ of charity. In having the which men be with god which is the
same charity.

The abbot Macharye as he was cly^myng upon the montayn of Nitrye he badde a
dyscyple of his that he should goo before him. And in his way he met with a
priest of the paynemyes law / beryng a great logge at his neck to whom the
dyscyple calling upon him began to say. O thou devil where do you run
now. The priest that was angry of his wrong did beat so sore the dyscyple that
he left him for deed. Anon after this priest met with saint Macharye that
greted him saying. O thou man that delivered the other saved may thou be. And
then the priest demanded of him / what good haste you see in me that thou
have so curtously greted me. The holy man answered unto him / that he had see
him run and labor in his way full fast / and he wist not where. And this
said he to the said priest because that he was a paynem and wyste not what he
did as touching our faith. The priest said to him. Certes I am touched with
compuncco^n through thy salutacyon / by the which I have known that thou art
gods man / but I have met with one I wot not what a wretched monk that
has wronged me over much. And also rewardynge by of his scornful words I
have give unto him grievous wou^des. Incontinent he was turned and swore that
he should not lat him go / till that he made him a monk. After they two went
togydre to the place where the dyscyple was hurt / and bare him in the
church. All the monks were glad of the conuersyon of the priest / for by him
many were turned. So said the abbot saint Macharye to this purpose / that
oftentimes proud and scornful words turn and tyse the good folk for to
do evil. Also humble langage moeueth the evil folk unto goodness.

Saint Anthonye said often / that none can be good how well he desires to be
so / if god be not with him for no man is good but he oonly / what soever
virtue is in us then / we must ever accuse our self and hold us for evil
folk. And thus mekyng our self we shall get mede.

One time the good saint Anthony saw all the grennes and snares of the devil
spredde over the earth. Then began he to weep and to weyle asking to god.
Alas and who shall mow eschew the subtle snares of the devil. Incontynente
he herd a voice that said to him. Anthonye humylyte all oonly may preserve
folk fro ye wickedness of the devil / to the which the proud can not come
by no wise.

An other time as he was in his oratorye / he herd a voice yt said. Anthony you
have not yet known the virtues of a man that taweth leder in Alexandrye. And
in the morning next after / after this voice y herd / saint Anthonye took his
staff / departed and ceased not his pas till he came at Alexa^drye ye cite
When saint Anthonye had found hy^ he questyoned hy^ of his virtues. Then ye
said holy man said to him yt he did no good at all / but yt every morning
when he rose first he said in him self that all they of ye cite should be
saved by their Justice. And to the contrary for the sins yt he made / he
demed yt he was worthy of everlasting dampnacyon. And in likewise when he yede
to bed at night / he remembered this thing as for truth. This seeing saint
Anthonye answered to him / certainly my sone I have be long in the deserts
with great business and care / but I had never so virtuous a co^syderaco^n. A
brother axed ones to the abbot Poemen what betokened a proposycyon of the postle
which is such / yt is to wit that to those yt be clean without spot of sin
/ all thing seems clean. The abbot answered unto him / yt he yt might come
thereto in manner yt he could under stand it well / he should hold himself the
lowest of all other creatures. The brother said there against / how can it be /
shall I hold my self for a gretter sinner than is a mansleer. The abbot said
/ when we see a ma^sleer we ought to consider / yt by adventure he did never
none other sin / and we have done Infynyte offenses / and have be murdered of
ourselfe sleeyng ourselfe through sin. And where the said brother asked him how
this could be do / he answered to him. The Iustyfycacyon oonly of man is to
repreue and correct himself / and then is the man Just / when of himself he
accuses and conde^pneth his sy^nes. Many Relygyouses were ones with the abbot
Poemen / whereof one began to praise a another saying. Yonde is a good man / for
he has horror of sins. The abbot then asked him / what horror of sy^nes
was to say. To which askyng ye relygyouse not knowing what answer he should
say / required ye abbot yt he would expowne what it mente. So ye said abbot
expowned it sayng that he yt has horror of yt is done amys / and ye blessyth
and loves his brother / he has horror of his sins.

A brother axed of the abbot Poemen how he might keep hy^ yt he should not say
ill of his even christian / whereat he answered that he and his even christian were
two images / and when he should dispyse his / he should Judge the other yt is to
wit his neighbor to be good and fair And to the contrary in praysyng his
own / he should despise that other his even christian / and when one repreueth
his own self ^esyly he habyteth none other person. And he that consydereth
his freyltee / he does like as he that dyspyseth a virtuous body. The abbot
Ipictus said ye like as a lion is ferfull to the wild asses / the which he
enforces hy^ to devour / all thus a Relygyouse yt is proved and known for a
steadfast man / is ferfull and corageouse to withstand against flesshly desires.
Morouer he be said that like as a proud horse is suddenly taken by ye brydell
likewise by fasting is a Relygyouse refrayned from ye sin of co^^pys^ence.
He said also yt the body of a monk dry and lene by fasting may^eth his soul
from the low things unto the sovereign / and all the delec^a^o^ns sensual
and carnal he dryet and sleeth. Item ye monk that it chaste shall be honored
in earth / and crowned in paradyse. Item he that can not keep his tongue besyly
against wrath / with great pain he shall co^ne be master of his passions or
temptacyons. Item men ought not to speak of nothing but it be virtuous or
longyng to virtue for after the common proverb of ye ^abondau^ce of heart
speaks the mouth. He said yet / yt ye vine bears never no thorns and that it
were better to a relygyouse for to ete flesh and drink wine than for to ete
his even christian by bakbytyng. And he told ye sometime in Sychye was made a
great feast where men would have given wine to an holy fader for to drink /
which making refuse of it / said yt they should have it a way / and that the
drynkyng of it should be his death.

An other time men brought unto certain brethern some wine of ye first making
out of the cup / or happily as for their thydes whereof many of this brethern
drank. An old brother that saw his brethern drink of it / fled anon to
his cave / the which Inco^tynente fell done upon hy^. The other brethern
seeing this Inconuenyente ra^ne thereat and found him half deed. Then said
some of them / yt by his sy^ne and vayn glory he was gone in to his said cave.
But their abbot said to them / lat hy^ alone it is my sone / ye cave shall not
be made again whiles I live / to the end yt ye world shall know yt it is fall
do^ne for a cup of wine. The abbot Johan said yt we yt take heed to our
sy^nes we be not over ladde with penance / but when we co^dempne some other
forsakyng our own body for them / we take then great charge up our self. And
to this purpose recou^ted ye said abbot Johan / yt sometime in Sychye were many
holy faders together which spoke of a relygyouse yt was a great sinner. The
abbot Pyot herkenyng after those ye accused ye said relygyouse stood up and
went and took a sack which he filled with sonde / and laded it upon his
back. And after he took an other little one yt he bare before him / and thus
lad he began to go. He was axed why he did so / whereat he answered / yt the
multitude of the sand yt was behind betokened his sins / the which he
would not put in his Remembrance nor weep for them / and the little quantyte
of sand yt was before him betokened the sins of his neighbors which he said
he had before his eyes / more than his own yt he would forgete / the which
thing men ought not to do. But to the contrary a body ought to putt his own
sins before him and ye other behind. The other abbott^ were much merueylled
thereof / and affermed and said that it was the way of salvation.

The abbot Ysaac being in The^ayde found him self among many Relygyouses
where he condemned a brother as gylty of certain sin that he had done. After
this he went again to his celle where he found an angel at the door yt
would not suffer him to come in / but if he should tell him first what thing
he should do of his brother yt he had condemned. Then he knew yt he had
sinned and cast himself do^ne to the ground. But the angel took him up and
said / that he should never Judge any body before that he were Iuged of god.

In a monasterye of Relygyouses was a monk yt committed a passing great caas
of which he was accused by his brethern / but this notwithstanding he said
there against with all his might / and went unto saint Anthonye. His brethern
followed him for to bring him again to the monasterye. And when they were come
together before saint Anthonye / they found there the abbot Paphonce otherwise
called Cephalus / the which in presence of them all said such words. I have
seen a man upon the shorys of a streme / the which was in the mire to ye knees
/ some for to bring him there out are come to him / they be entered therein to
the neck. Then these words y herd / the said accusacours were all abashed
/ and understood that this words were put unto them / wherefore in humylyte
they returned with the said brother to their abbaye. One of the said holy
faders said ye when we see any body yt does sin / we ought not to put it
upon him / but upon him that makes him for to do it / consyderyng yt the
devil also may bring us to have a fall. Morouer he said yt none was in the
world yt will sin / but we be all deceived.

An hermyte named Thymothee dispysyng a brother of his Relygyouse / cou^seylled
his abbot ye he should pu^ hy^ out of his abbaye. After ye which puttyng out /
ye said hermyte fell in to a gryuouse sin / of which he made many
co^playntes. And as he was often cryeng for mercy unto our lord / he herd a
voice yt said to hy^. Tymothee this shame is happed to ye because of yt that you
have despised thy brother falling in sin. An other brother was which reherced
yt he had seen a vysyon four ordres in heaven. The first order was of folk
feeble in ye faith / but nevertheless they gave thanks unto god. The second of
the hostelers which were ordained to receive ye other as almeners. The third
was of solytarye folk which forsake ye world as hermytes. And ye fourth was
of those yt have withstonde to their own will and were submytted unto the
subgeccyrn of their faders spyrytuall / as relygyouses that make four vows And
he said that the last had more noble astate than the other / and for this cause
they bare at their necks colers of gold. Morouer said the same Relygyouse
that in seeing the said vysyon he demanded of him yt showed it unto him why
the last where more worshypped than the other. He answered unto him that the
hospytalers almeners and hermytes that be in deserts be not subget but to
their will / but the other gave them self all togydre to god under the
subgeccyon of other / whereby their merit is more greter in honor. Obedyence
is the salvation of euerychone and the mother of all virtues / she opens the
heuens / she lysteth ye man unto heaven / she is felawe to angels and the mete
and consolaco^n of all the saints which by obedyence are come to everlasting
glory.

An holy fader said yt when a brother commands an other for to do some good
work with dread of god and with holy meekness such a commandment shall be
done / but when men commands any thing without to have regard to god ward
but oonly to his own aue^orys^. It happeth often yt he which is so commanded
does no thing thereof / wherefore it is to be noted / that all ye proceeds of
god begins by humylyte. And to ye contrary yt ye comes of the devil it is
bego^ne by pride or by ire and by trouble of other oonly.

The abbot Syluayn had a dyscyple named Marc much necessary and obedyent yt
which was well loved of his master / This abbot had it other dyscyples yt
which were right ^ory and wroth of that thabbot loved more the said Marc
than he did any other of the^ It happed yt the old faders yt were sorry of
this vysyon / came and showed it unto the abbot. But before yt they reherced any
thing of the caas / they went to all the chambres of the.xi. with the said
abbot and knocked at every door / but there answered no body. Fynably they
came to ye door of ye said dyscyples chamber / the which incontinent yt he
herd his master he left an O yt he had begone to make whereof he made but half
for great desire and have yt he had to obey unto his master. Then ye old
faders yt were with hy^ did praise this dyscyple and loved hy^ more then ye
abbot did Two brethern of fader and of mother were in a monasterye / whereof
the one was much obedyent / and the other contynent and chaste. The obedyent
did all that to hy^ was commanded. He yt was chaste had en^^e upon the other
/ and would preue if he was veraye obedyent. And to this intent he prayed the
abbot that he might have leave to goo out with his brother. The abbot gaaf them
leave for to preue his obedyence / when they were come nyghe a water where were
many bestes called Cocodrylles and of which many men ben perysshed / ye chaste
said to the obedyent. Go first over I pray the. Incontinent ye obedyent passed
over the flood / and all the said bestes came to him as they should have
devoured him / nevertheless they made him worship lyckynge his clothes about
him. After the chaste commanded him that he should come again and he did
so. Then they went forth and found a corpse deed. The chaste said / if we
had some old thing we should cover this deed body. The obedyent answered. Let us rather pray god for him / for happily god shall reyse him. So began they for
to pray. And anon by the grace of god he was raised fro death to life of
which thing the chaste boosted hy^ self and praised / saying it was for his
co^tynence that god had done this miracle. All which things were showed unto
their abbot / yt which after their coming again blamed them / and the chaste
he repreued sharply because that he had tempted his brother And to the end he
should not be proud or folyshe gloryouse / he said to him / that for the
obedyens of his brother the deed corpse had be raised from death to life.

One of the holy faders of Sychye sent his dyscyple in Egypt for to fetch a
Camel for to bear in to the said Egypt the baskettes and the maundes that he
made The which dyscyple desyryng to obey went redyly thither and brought one
from these. But as he was coming again / he found an other hermyte by the way
that said to him My child if I had known that thou had gone for to fette a
Camel. I should have prayed the for to have brought me one. The which thing
the dyscyple reported and told unto his master yt sent him to the said holy
man again for to led unto him the Camel that he had brought for his said
master. And with that he had him that he should goo with him in Egypt for to
help him to bring there his baskettes The dyscyple went again to the said holy
fader and said to him. Fair fader my fader sends the this Camel for thyn
own use after thy necessyte. For he is not ready for to goo in to Egypt Then
all his maundes and baskettes were laden and had in to Egypt. When they were
come thither / the dyscyple holped him to unlade. And when he would have come
again he said to the holy man. My fader I beseech the yt it will please the for
to pray god for me. Then the holy fader asked him where he would go / whereat
he answered that he would return homewarde for to fette the baskettes of his
fader abbot. The other holy fader was then much wroth and angry / and
besought the dyscyple that he and his fader should have pity of him For their
great charity made him lose his merit that said he.

An other hermyte had many baskettes and maundes ready made for to goo to the
markette withal. So it happed as by adventure / that he herd his neighbor
that said. I wot not what I shall do / the markette comes in hand / and I
have no couerynges ready for my baskettes. He that had his baskettes and their
couerynges ready all Ready made / he took of the couerynges / and said to his
said neighbor / hold here my friend some couerynges / for I have more thanne
I need / tha^ shall be good for to cover thy baskettes withal. The which
charity was w^ll in heart in so much that he brake his own work for to
fulfill the work of his neighbor.

The a (...) Johan was so charytable / that his great charity suffered him not
to know any malice. This abbot for to have occupacyon to his orysons borrowed a
penny of one of his brethern whereof he bought some flax for to occupye him
withal / when he had bought it / one of his brethern came to him for to
borowe some of him to make a sack with / and he took him some with a good will.
There came to hy^ an other again that also had some thereof. And fynably he leued
so much of his flax as well to the one as to the other / that there abode
nothing for him self. He that had leued him the penny desired him to pay it
hy^ again. Then had he another penny nor no flax. And here it is to be noted that
a penny was then worth a s^^te or more. And because he wyste not whereof he
should take him again his penny that he had lend him. He purposed that he
should go to the abbot James / him to pray that he would pay a penny for him
to him that had leued it unto him / because he was not of power for to pa^e if
himself. It happed yt as he went thydre he found one penny in his way / but he
durst not take it up. So came he again to his ^elle for to pray god. Then
came there again the credytour for to ask his penny of the simple man / that
promised hy^ he should fette it for him anon / wherefore he departed again for to
goo toward the said abbot James but because that he found yet again ye said
penny in his way / he durst pass no ferther / but returned again to his little
house. Thyrdely came there the said credytour for to hau his penny. Then the
holy man answered unto him that without any fault he would go fetch it. And at
the third time he found yet his penny / the which he took up then / and
bare it unto the said abbot James / saying that he had found it by the way /
but nevertheless he besought the said abbot yt he would make to wit through out
the cite / yt if any body had lost one penny yt he should come toward hy^ and
yt he had found him the which thing was showed during three days / but no
body came yt said it was his. Then ye said Johan said to James / that he
should take it to hy^ yt had leued him one / for as he was coming to him for to
have borrowed it / he had found it.

The abbot Poemen said / that we ought not to fulfylle our wylles / but them
of our neighbors. And when men prayed him for to ete more than his will was /
he wept / because yt he constrained himself over his will / to the end yt he
should not dysobeye his neyghebour. And in many other manners / he strayned his
will to the will of other.

An hermyte sometime nyghe a monasterye of Relygyouses made many miracles. Ones
among other / the Relygyouses went toward him / and made him to ete against
his will. And after they said to him yt he was sorye and dyspleasaunt because
that he had eten against his will. He answered that the contrary was troth /
that is to say / that he had trybulacion when he did his own will.

The abbot Paphonce had of custom that he drank never no wine. It happed one
day as he trauaylled by ye way that he was met with thieves / of which the
pryncypall knew him. And because he knew well his custom to drink no wine /
seeing that he was weary of the way / he took a cruse full of wine and a glauye
in his hand / and said unto him / that if he drank not / he should slay him.
Then the holy man knowing that this thing came of the will of god / and that
it should be the cause of the conuersyon of the said thief and of his felawes /
he took ye wine and drank it. Then the said thief prayed him yt he would
pardo^ne him that he had so constrained him. To whom he answered. I have my
trust in god / that because thou have given me drink / thou shall have
forgyuenesse of thy sins and paradyse at thyn endyng. And then the thief
said to him. And fro this hour forthon my self trusting in the mercy of god.
I promise the that I shall never do no harm unto no body / and by this
means was the said thief and his felawes turned unto god ward and lived after
honestly.

Two hermytes were sometime where of one was older than the other. So requyryng
the old to the young / that he would be content yt they should do both togydre
their resydence / yt which thing the young would not grant / but excusing
himself said / that it was not his caas for to dwell with him / because he was
to great a sinner. The old which was a man of right holy life / heryng this
answer / he had it not agreeable. For how well that the other relygyouse was
young / nevertheless this old hermyte could not believe after yt he led a
life solytarye / but that he was of good life / and without spotte of sin /
fynably after many word is / they were content for to dwell togydre one weke /
and when the seven night was past / the old Required and asked of the young /
how he had governed him self that weke. He answered to him that because that
he was compelled by necessyte to issue out of his own celle / he was fall in
great temptaco^n of sin Then said there against the old hermyte / askyng if
he would do thereof penance / whereat the young andswerd ye. Then ye old
moeued with a feruente charity and knowing his ferme steadfastness / said to
him / that he was content to make and bear upon himself ye half of his
penance. And for so much should they have need for to dwell the one with ye
other / which they did so unto the hour of their decesse.

An ancyente holy fader said / that whosoever desires for to be saved / he
ought curyously to see that he do not to an other / that which he would not
be done unto. And how well that some do to him any harm shame or Iniurye / he
ought not therefore to do the same to an other. And this manner of living is
suffysaunt enough to euerychone for to have his soul thereby saved.

Two holy faders brethern germayn / one called Poemen and the other Nub to his
name and dwelled in ye deserts / and lived there a much solytary life and
relygyouse. Their mother affectuelly desyry^g to see them / because yt after yt
they were departed fro the world / she had not seen them / she went herself
toward them for to see and vysyte them. And how well that she made all
dylygence for to speak with them / nevertheless she could not find the manner to
have leyser thereunto / fynably she did so much yt she found herself ones
before the entree of their chapel / and in great lame^taco^ns and teeres she
trowed to have made them speak with her / but they would not / doubtyng yt they
should happily have run in to some sin by ye mean. And as they had open ye
door of their ce^le or habytacyon for to goo to their said chapel / when they
apperceyued their mother they shett their door again upon them. Their mother this
seeing yt they would not speak to her / began for to weep at their door with
great habondau^ce of teres. And thus as they devised them taking counsel and
their advise togydre / what thing they ought to do for to content her / she
took her self for to cry and weyle more than she did before. So came to her
then the holy fader Poemen / and without to open the door he asked her / why
she yt all ready was old / made such complayntes which might be to her much
greuable. She herynge and understanding yt it was one of her chyldern yt to her
spoke she answered as she had spoken unto both of them. Alas my childern I
beweyle and weep for to speak with you / because ye syngulerly I desire to see
you. Alas why do ye refuse me your presence / what danger is there if I see you
/ am I not your mother / have not I nourysshed you with this pappes mine. I have
waited so long for to see you that under this hope I am come unto so old aege
/ that I am all dysabled of my members / and for great desire yt I have to see
you mine entreylles are all troubled and sore moeued. Then the holy fader
Poemen asked her which of both she had lever other to see them in this world
/ or else fynably in the glory of heaven / whereat she answered that she should
be well content not to see them in this world / so that she might be sure
that she should see them after their death in heaven. After this answer / the
said Poemen said unto her / that if she might withstand her affection and not
see them in this world. For certain she should see them shortly in the other
world. Then she herynge the words of her sone / said to him Sith that thou
promysesse me for certain / that I shall see you in paradyse I look no more for
to see you here. And then she went her way well appayde and glad.

A young Relygyouse named Johan the left of the nation of ye Thebayens was in
service with an holy fader by the space of.xij. year / which old fader was
called Amon during the said time grieved with a contynuall syknesse / which
caused him that he was so wayward / that he never gaaf fair langage nor good
to his said servant Johan / whereby he should be plyaunt and glad to serve
him. But this notwithstanding he served him much swetely and kyndely. So it
happed that when the said holy fader Amon came to ye last hour of his life
that his soul must depart / where many holy faders were present / he took
before them all the said Johan his servant by ye hand and three times he said
unto hy^. Johan saved mote yt be. And then he said to the holy faders that
were with him My brethern I betake you this good relygyouse / he is no man /
but an angel. Certainly during my sykenes / he never had of me a fair word /
and nevertheless in great humylyte and pacyence he has done to me Infynyte
seruyces / so recome^de I hy^ to you asmoche as I can The holy fader Agathon
where he ones came to ye cite yt was most nygh his hermytage for to selle some
hand work yt he had made for to live upon he found at the gate of the said
cite a man yt was sore like which was forsake and left of all men. The which
thing seeing yt said holy fader Agathon he hired a little chamber where in he
brought hy^ and cheryshed hy^ and kept him ye space of four months unto time
yt he was recovered and was hole. And after returned this holy fader in to his
hermytage.

An other holy fader for to moeue to ye virtue of pacyence a dyscyple of his yt
was sore passyoned and tourmented of a grievous maladye / said unto hy^ in this
wife. My sone you must bear pacyently thy soroufull afflyccions without to be
wroth with them. It is a sovereign virtue to a man for to praise and thank
god in his trybulaco^ns and aduersytees. If yt be hard as is the iron you shall
lose thy Rustynes by fire / and if you be gold / you shalt also be preued by
fire / and from great things thou shall come to things more great. If god
will send us some sykenesses we ought not to grutche there against / and if we
bear them not with pacyence we shall have no mede for it toward him. So must
we be used to be pacyent / prayeng him humbly that he will send us all that
pleases him / to the end that by the merit that we shall get in enduryng
pacyently the afflycco^ns and tourmentes of this world / we mow have the
glory ever lasting.

An other holy fader yt was often taken with syknesses / was ones a hole year
without / wherefore he began to weep strongly beryng his health noyously / and
saying to our lord such words. Sire you have left me / and thou would not
vysyte nor see me this year. As he would have said / yt god vysytyng his
friends sends to them pouerte and syknes for to make them to be rewarded for
it in heaven. Some holy faders reherced of one of them yt dyed in Sychye / yt
they being about hy^ / they dothed him as they were wont to clothe ye one of
thordre at their decesse. And doyeng this they began to weep sore for pity yt
they had to see hy^ dey. He hery^g their wepy^g is and sorrows opened his eyes
/ and in beholding them he lough three times upon them. The which thing seeing
ye said brethern / anon after they asked hy^ why he lough when they wept / and
he answered to them I have laughed twyes to mock you with all / ye first time yt
I lough was because yt ye fere death / and ye second time was because yt ye
know well and can not Judge otherwise but ye must ones dey and ye wot not when
/ and yet ye dyspose not your self thereto / and thyrdly I have laughed
reioysshy^g my self / because yt in leuy^g ye labors of this world. I goo
unto ye place of rest / and these words thus said he closed his eyes and
swetely he yielded his ghost to our savior Ihesu christ.

Thabbot Pa^mon at ye hour of his death said to ye brethern yt acompanyed him.
My brethern because that syn the time yt I came to this solytarye place where I
have builded for mine usage this little house wherein I do dwell. I am not
remembered yt ever I ete other bread / but of ye same which I have gotten with
labor of mine hondes / nor to have said nor told unto this hour any vain
word whereof I ought to repence me in this manner I go now to our blessed lord
Ihesu christ / whereof I ought well to thank him. And I meruaylle gretely how he
wouchesaufe take the last of me / seen that I first was occupied to get my
living / and have not as yet bego^ne to hy^ any suffysau^t seruyse. The abbot
Agathon going out of this world / three days before his deces hylde his eyes
co^tynuelly open and by no manner he moeued them not. The which thing seeing
his brothern yt were about him sore co^playnyng and weeping asked hy^. O our
fader tell us if it please the whereat you thynkest now / and where you are at
this hour. To whom he answered. I am called tofore the presence of god which
is in his seete for to Judge me. A as said they to hy^ again / and ferest you him.
To whom he said again. I have ever with all my strength enforced my self for to
do yt commandment of god. But nevertheless I consider yt I am a sinner /
wherefore I can not say if my works have be unto hy^ agreeable. And how said the
holy faders haste not you believe in thy works which have ever be vertuoles and
after his law. Then he answered I not dare trust thereupon in his presence /
for there is to much dyfference betwix his Judgment and the Judgment of men.

The abbot Sysonyn being at the hour of death / many aeged faders that together
were come there for to see him apperceyued suddenly his face which shynyng
bright wonderfully. And in that self caas he said unto them. My brethern see
to it / the holy fader Anthonye comes to us here. Anon after he said again. My
brethern / here is the company of the postles. And saying the same his vysage
wexed more bryghte. So began he to say ones again that he saw the postles
that came there / and it seemed that he should speak unto them. And whether
these holy faders or some of them did Require him that he should tell them to
whom he spoke. He answered that he spoke with the angel that came for to
set his soul / and besought them that they should forbere a little or they
should have him away till that he should have done some little penance. Then
said there against ye holy faders to hy^ / you have no need fair fader to do any
penance. The which answered to them. Surely my brethern. I can not Remember
me that ever I began yet to do any suffysaunt penance. By the which answer
they knew that he was very parfyte in the dread of god And they being in
this ymagynacyon they saw his face wounderfully and more bright than it was a
fore. Then said he to them / see see my brethern our lord comes. And saying
these words he gaaf up his gooste in the hands of god.

The holy fader Arsenyen was in his time so virtuous and so much enfla^med
with ye love of Ihesu christ / yt the most part of the time contemplyeng his
worthy death and passion / he wept and bewaylled / so yt by co^tynuau^ce of
weeping away ye habondau^ce of teeres from his eyes all the herys of ye lyddes
of the eyes fell of and never grew again / when he should deye he ordained to
his dyscyples yt they should not do none almose nor any charytable deed for hy^
/ saying that if he had himself done some he should find it. and because yt
these his dyscyples were troubled of yt they saw ye hour of his death draw
nygh / he said unto them. My childern ye hour of my death is not yet come /
when it shall be nyghe I shall not be still / but always I pray you / that if
ye dese to sorn any part of my body / ye shall thereof give acompte before god
in his Judgment / where I shall accuse you thereof if ye do so. Then they
asked him what they should do with his body / for they wist nothing of wyndyng
of deed folk. So answered he then to them. Ye shall bind my feet togydre
with a cord and then ye shall draw me unto the top of the montayn where men
have of custom to bury yt other. After he took hy^self to weep as he was wont
to do all the time of his life. And where the holy faders being about hy^ saw
hy^ weep so sore / they asked him / what moeued him for to do so / and if he
had any dread or feer. To whom he answered / ye truly he doubted much our
lord as he always had done / namely sith yt he was made Relygyouse. The holy
abbot Poemen seeing him after his death said such words of him. O holy fader
Arsenyen / you art well happy that you have wept so much in these world / for
certainly he that not have wept here / shall be constrained to weep in ye other
world. And it is Impossyble yt a man may be forborne other for to weep here
with his will for to decerne the Joy euerlasty^g / or to weep by co^straynte
in ye torments of hell for ye punyco^n of his sy^nes. Of this holy fader
Arsenyen fold ye holy fader abbot Danyell yt how be it yt he was greatly
lettred and expert in yt knowloge of holy scripture / nevertheless feryn to
run in to vayn glory / he would never argue thereof / nor also write no manner
of pystles / but if he was constrained by great necessite for to do so / and
when he found hy^self in ye covent of yt company of holy faders he stood
always behy^de a pyler if any was there / to the end yt he should not have
occasion to look nor speak unto any person / and also because no body should
see nor spek to hy^. His beholdy^g was al like to an angel / he had his herys
whyt as Jacob had / and also arrayed as he was / long and be^teful of body /
and how be it always yt he was sore lene and dry / yet came his herd do^ne to
ye belly of hy^ / and so was he bowyng foreward because of his great age / and
he deyed when he was come to his four score and.xv. year. He had dwelled.xl.
year in yt palace of the noble Theodosyen which was fader to Honorius and
Archadins. After yt he dwelled in a place called Troyn upon Babylony toward ye
cite of Nemphis / and three year in Alexandrye. After he returned again to Troyn
foresaid where he dwelled other two years / and there he yielded his ghost to god
as he that was fulfilled with very faith and with the grace of the holy ghost.

Saint Athanasy bishop of Alexa^drye sent word ones to ye abbot Pambon that
he should come see him. The which obeyng to his request went there with some
of his Relygyouses. And in coming toward the said Athanasy which seeing some
seculers yt were in their way and put not them self in purpose for to do
nor show to them due Reverence / he said to them. Arise up my friends and
salve these good Relygyouses to the end yt they shall give you their
blessings / certaynely they spoke often with god / and their word is holy.
And in saying these words / he saw in ye street a poor sy^ner a common woman
which was curyously arrayed So began be to weep when he saw her / wherefore it
was asked of him by them present what thing moeued by for to weep. To the
which being present ^e answered two things which I see cause me to do so
One is the loss of yt poor woman / and the other is yt I take not so great
thought nor care to please god / as she does to please the sinners and
dyshonest men.

It is found written of an old holy fader yt when he had Intencyon to do
penance of some sin whereof he was desceyued and his sensualyte said to hy^
yt he should defer it to an other day and yt he should always come time
enough for to repent him of it ^e answered yt he should not l^ue for to do
redely his penance / for it ought for to be done hastly / because yt we be not
in surte that we shall live do day more. And after when he should have done
his purpose god should do then or the next day his pleasure of him.

An other of the holy faders showed of a bishop yt which because he had herd
tell ye two of his subgettes were auoutrers / he prayed our lord yt he would
given certain knowloge if they were as foul bespotted as folk said / and upon
a day then after yt he had song mass / his subgett coming to ye altar for
to receive there the precious body of our lord / he knew by dyuyne
inspyracyon whether their thoughts were good or badde / and namely he knew
the sinners by their faces yt were black as coals / and their eyes reed as
blood. And the other yt were clean puryfyed of their sins he knew also by
their vysages and vestymentes that showed to be white / to all the which
Indyfferently be admynystred the holy sacrament of the altar. And this done
the faces of some of them seemed him as bright as the son gyuyng a light
soueraynly. And the faces of the other seemed as they had be esprysed with a
dredefull flame. But in gyuyng the said sacrament to the two aduoutrers of
which is touched above / he apperceyued that one of them had ye face full
bright and clear and was honorably clothed with vesture full fair and white.
And the contrary the other had a black and an horrible vysage and after that
they had received that self holy sacrament of the altar / he with the white
face / showed him self to have a strength of courage which made him appyere
to be clean and purged from all wickedness. That other showed to have his face
taken with fire Right horrible and doubtable. This seeing the holy bishop /
besought our lord that he would teache him what betokened this vysyon To whom
by the will of god an angel did appyere which said unto him / that all that
he had seen was true / but as to him that had the vysage black / because he
was obstynate in his sin / having a will purposyng ever more to sin / for
that cause had he seen his vysage black and horrybly taken with dredefull
fire. But that other his felawe / that was lyghtened with a bright vysage /
bringing unto mind through bitter sorrow / the sins yt he had done and
forsakynge them with great teeres and sobbynges / he had gotten and axed the
mercy of god / promyttyng if it pleased him to forgive quytte and pardo^ne unto
him his sins by him done in time passed / that he should never return for to
do them again. And for this cause he was come to that grace which this holy
bishop saw. And where this foresaid bishop meruaylled him self of the
sovereign grace of god / because that not oonly he had preserved this sinner
repentaunt from the tourmentes which are due to them that led a foul and
wicked life / but also with ye same / he would make him fair with so great
honor the angel said to him that not without a cause he meruaylled / seen
that he was a man that can not comprehend the bounte of our lord / the which
is Infynytly good and kind to them that forsaken their sins / to whom also
when they do penance after devout co^fessyon / he not oonly forgyueth their
sins / but with this he makes them worthy to be worshyped. And in troth the
angel said / god has so derely loved the sinners / that he has sent his
oonly sone / and ordained him for to suffer death in this world for to redeem
them from the pains of hell. Sith then he would deye for them how be it
that they were his enemies / how much shall he be wyllyng to love them when
they shall be by very penance his own childern. And therefore wit it said
the angel / that no sin of man can not overcome the goodness of god / namely
when he that shall have done any sin / shall be wyllyng to put him self in
pain for to put out and slay by penance his wyckednesses and sins. For our
lord which is Infynytly merciful knows well the feblenesse and wekenesse of
the kind of man / the strength of the passions / and the might and malice of
the devil. And there as he knows ye sy^ner to be over thrawen in sin /
them pardo^nyng as to his childern he taryeth and abides every day after their
amendeme^t and wylfull correcco^n and he has pity and co^passyon of them yt
be repentau^t as of those ye sore ^ vexed with sykenesse awayte^ after the
physycyen. And suddenly vnbynden and casting their sins out of them / he
grau^teth to them Just rewards of their penau^ces. Then ye bishop foresaid
heryng these things merueylled more than he had done before / and hertly he
praised ye name of god.

The abbot Powle surnamed the simple / purchaced of god this grace / yt in
lokyng upon them yt entered in to ye church / he wist to say by their vysages
if their thought were good or bad so it happed on a day yt he saw many folk
come to yt chirch and had their faces bright and clear and were merry in their
hertes / and with them were their good angels that gladly ladde them and bare
them felyshyp. Soon after he saw one come that was wou^derfull black and all
his body was compassed with an horrible cloud / and with him were many deuyls
/ the which by a train that was made fast at his nose threllys / they drew
him here and there so that he wist not what he should do / and after far from
him came his good angel which was full heavy and an angered. The which thing
seeing the good fader saint Powle / he began to weep full bytterly and smote
his breast / and would not enter within ye church / but he satte him self
done there by for to see the end of that man yt he saw in so pyteouse
astate. The other that were entered within the said church and saw him weep
thus / desired and prayed him hertely if he had seen in them any vycyouse thing
/ that for their correccyon he would tell it them / or else that he would
come in to the church with them the which thing he would not do / but ever
continued in weeping and sorrows consyderyng the dau^gerouse astate of him that
he had seen thus withholden and bound by the dampened fendes of hell Anon
after the said holy abbot / seeing all the company that he had seen go
within the church come out of it after the absolucyon to them given / set
him self for to behold their faces / for to know if they were such at their
coming out of ye church / as they were when they went ynne. And pryncypally
he casted his sight upon ye wretchyd sy^ner which he had seen go with so great
hardness within the said church / and he saw that his face feerfull and
black was wexed full fair and bright and all his body whyt / and that the
deuyls followed him fro far and his good angel by him that made unto him a
much glad chere. Then saint Powle fulfilled with a synguler gladness / rose
up and began for to cry with a high voice and said. O how great is the mercy
and meekness of our lord. And coming to a another place a little nerer he said
yet with a louder voice. Come hither devout christian and see the works of god
/ come and see how he will that al folk shall be saved and that they come to
ye knowloge of truth / come hither and worship him with me saying. Lord god /
you art that self alone yt may enrase and put out our sins. And when they
were all come togydre with the good Powle / he showed unto them all that he
had seen before that they entered in to the church / and also at their coming
out of the same. And after he asked after him that he had seen troubled as it
is said / for to declare unto him his thoughts and his deeds / and how god had
done unto him so great a grace and chau^gyng from evil in to good. And then
ye same man in presence of all the assystens began to tell openly / how he was
a great sinner and had holy given him self in time passed unto many a great
sin foul and abhomynable. And how entryng in the church he had herd the
words of our lord / saying by the mouth of Ysaye the prophet. Wasshe your
self and be clean / and put away the malyces and sins from your souls /
for to be present purely and clenely before my presence / learn to do good /
and seek Justice and ryghtwysnesse. And if your sins be reed and enfla^med by
the bronde of co^cupyscence / in dooyng this ye said is / they shall become
white as snow. And also if ye will here me and do yt I say / ye shall ete of
the goods of the earth. And morouer said the said repentau^t sinner. I am a
wretched fornycatour which is touched with co^puncco^n through the said words
of you prophet / entryng within the church I have said unto god in my courage.
Sire I know that thou art he that is come for to save the sinners / wherefore
humbly I pray the that now it will please the to accomplysshe in me unworthy
sinner yt that ye have promised by the mouth of the holy prophet. And fro
this time I promise the with all mine heart / that I shall no more return in to
my sin. And in witstondyng to all wyckednes and Iniustyce I think me to
serve the with conscience pure and clean. From this day then and from this
hour will you wouchesaufe to receive me as very penytent / worshypyng thy
souerayn god head and forsakyng all my sins / the which thing you ought not
to refuse me seen that I have in my self stablysshed and sworen to keep all thy
Iustyfycacyons. And under this promise ye foresaid penytent said yt he was come
out of the said church ordeynyng in him self never to do sin. The which
things heryng yt said good old men being there / they began to cry to god
ward saying in this wise. O lord god how great and praysyngly ben thy works /
yt have done all things in wysdom The abbot Iosephell going with some other
good old faders toward the abbot Poemen / one of ye friends of the said Poemen
brought before his monasterye a child of his / yt Inco^uenyentes and vexaco^ns
of the devil had ye face all dysfygured / the which friend syttyng with his
said child without the said monasterye wept with great habondau^ce of teeres.
And one of ye said good old faders heryng yt weylynge and sorrows of the fader
of the said child / was gone out of the said monasterye for to wit who moeued
hy^ for to weep so / he axed him of ye cause. Whereat he answered / that he was
kynnesman unto the said abbot Poemen / and was come there to ye end he might
have through his mean the health to ye said child / which nevertheless he
feered to have brought within the church doubtyng yt the said abbot Poemen
which had feere to have bruyt and reno^mee yt he should make miracles / would
have put him out again Saying morouer yt he seeing the said holy faders come
there / he had purposed under their confydence yt he should bring there his
said child. And after castyng his words toward the abbot Iosephell foresaid /
he said thus to hy^ Holy fader have mercy upon me and my child and make him to
be brought therein with the / to the end yt ye holy fader Poemen seeing hy^ he
will pray god for him. The which abbot Iosephell beryng the same child to ye
celle of the said Poemen and vsyng with wise counseyll presented him not at
first metyng unto the abbot Poemen. For he would not have be well content if
he had seen that the said Iosephell should have had so great trust of him /
as for to have heled him by miracle / but he presented him unto ye lower
brethern and said to them. My brethern bless thy child and pray god for him
/ and after he required the other brothern to do so likewise / and folowyngly
he came to ye said abbot Poemen to whom he made like Request. But nevertheless
he would not entromytte hy^ thereof And where all them being present required
hy^ to pray with them as they did / he was content to do so. So stood he up
and weeping prayed with yt other in this manner. O my god thy will be for to
help this child which is thy creature / and suffer no longer yt the send
have any domynaco^n over him. The which oryson fynysshed and ye said child
blessed by hy^ with the sign of the cross / he was anon given hole and sonde
unto his fader.

Sometime one of the holy faders was axed / if pouerte was a parfytte good / the
which answered yt it was a great afflyccyon / but who yt susteyneth it
wylfully all ^e it he be tormented with it in his flesh / nevertheless in
beryng ye same he fyndeth the rest of his own soul.

A young Relygyouse made such a questyon to an old relygyouse / that is to
wit / if a brother of his ought hy^ a little sum of money and if he should
are it hy^ or no. To the which yt old answered yt he might well are it with
humylyte ones oonly. And the young said to him. If he will not pay me then /
what ought I to do. Thou shall said the other speak no more of it Ye but said
the young monk. I shall not have power to break my courage but that I shall be
to him hasty or calling thereupon. Whereat ye old answered / you must be master
of thy self / and chyde with thyn own self oonly / to the end that you anger
not thy brother / for thou ought to keep the there from as besely as you can /
seen namely that thou art a Relygyouse.

An other young brother Required one ye was old / yt he would tell hy^ how and
by what manner he might get parfytte meekness. Whereat he answered yt he should
come to it lightly / if he would consider his own wickedness / and not they
of other / sayng with this / yt the perfeccion of man is humylyte and of
asmoche as ye man abateth himself low by humylyte / so much more is he
enhau^sed by his humylyte / for like as the cursed sin of pride if hit will
be areysed unto heaven / is confounded and ouerthrawen unto ye betom of hell.
All thus humilyte if it descends unto ye lowest degree / it is then exalted
unto heaven.

The holy abbot Macharye walking on a time by the deserts / found in his
way upon the earth ye head of a deed man which head he turned with his
staff over all sides / and thus doing be herd the head that sorowed and
weyled. And because it sowned no word that be could understand / he asked
what made it so to complain. Where at the head answered / that it was the bid
of a priest of the paynemyes law which had be a prince of the synagoge of
Ydoles that in the same place were reverenced and worshypped / and by cause I
know the fulfilled with the holy ghost. I am moeued for to requere thy grace /
knowing that at any time that it will please the for to pray for them yt be
in pain / they shall feel some consolacyon. Then the said holy abbot
Macharye said to hy^ Now answer me / what is your comfort / and what is your
pain. Whereat the same head more stro^gely weylyng than tofore began to say.
Ha holy fader our pain is so great / that we be from the fete to the head
thrawen within a feerful fire / which is more high than there is space
between the heaven and the earth / and that more encreaceth our sorrow. It is
not unto us possible for to see each other / but the faces of every one of us
ben Joined ouerthward unto our backs. And when you prayest for us / then see
we the one ye other openly / which is unto us some comfort. These words said
/ the holy man Macharye began to weep and said. Cursed be the day in which ye
man has presumed to despise or break the commandments of god. And after he
enquered again of the said head / if in the place where they were tourmented /
were any great pains. To whom it answered that in yt wretched place were many
one that were much more low therein than the paynemes were. And where ye holy
fader asked what they were / the head answered and said / we that have had no
knowloge of the sovereign god have some what of mercy / but as to them that
have known him and forsaken / they be underneath us traueylled and tourmented
with diverse tourmentes. The which words y herd by the good abbot foresaid /
and after that he had shoued the said head in to the earth / he went forthon
his way.

An other brother axed of an aeged holy fader / why men of Relygyon were
oftentimes tempted and befought of the devil of hell / whereat he answered. It
is because that we cast away from us our armor and deffenses that are
pacyence / humylyte / debonarete / and wyllefull obedyence.

An other brother required the abbot Sysonyns that he should tell him / if the
devil did persyewe so strongely the Relygyouses that then were / as they
did ye other in time passed. The which Sysonyns answered unto him that they
more prycked and pursyewed them / than they had done the older because that
the devil knows the ending of the world which draws nyghe / where his
tourmentes shall encreace and multyplye in diverse manners wherein he desires to
aco^panyed with Infynyte legyons of sinners for to be brenned and tourmented
with him in fire and in sulphur where he wayteth to brenne perpetuelly. And
for this cause he pursyeweth the folk / and not oonly so besely the wicked
folk which he knows to be lightly turned to obey his cursed and most
grettest wyles / but also more curyously and with more great dylygence he
pursyeweth the good folk where he knows them to be of more stable and
steadfast courage.

Some other brethern knowing an other aeged fader to be wounderfull prudente
and wise / asked hy^ by what means he had gotten so great wysdom Whereat he
answered / that he had never retained nor suffer to soyourne in his heart any
evil thoughts / by the which he doubted to have provoked our lord god to be
wroth against him. Saint Anthonye said yt a Relygyouse if to him were possible
ought to give acomptes unto his elders / not only of all the passes yt he
makes in his celle or in his monasterye / but also of all the water yt he
drynketh and of every time that he takes of it for to drink / to the end he
should make him content and certain of his living and gouernemente for to
keep him self that he shall not trespass nor take away contrary to them.

The abbot Poemen said yt the fend in no thing takes so great a gladness as
he does when he may over come a sinner so that he will not utter nor show
his sins by confession.

A y^ng relygyouse said to an aeged fader that oftentimes he questyoned ye old
fa^ers to the end they should tell him and also yt he should serve of them some
good lore and Instruccyons for his soul to be saved but what soever they told
him he could not withholde no thing. Now had this old fader to who^^ he spoke
two vessels yt were empty. So commanded ^e to the young Relygyouse yt he
should take one of them and wasshe it clean with fayte water and set it again
in his place which thing be made him do ones and ones again. Then said to
him the old fader that he should bring him both the vessels and he did so
And then he asked him which of them two was clener Whereat the young answered
that it was that self wherein he had put water with the which he had washed
it. The old said there against. My sone it is thus of our soul when it
herkenneth often the words of god / for how be it that it keeps no thing of
thoo words that it hereth or of those that it Requires to be told unto it
for to save the soul by / nevertheless it is more clean thereby / than if it
herd not nor asked no thing of it / by this namely / that thus doyeng she
escheweth evil thoughts and ouercometh the temptacyons of the devil.

An other said also to an old fader that when a Relygyouse haunted and
occupyeth him self to good works / the devil coming to him for to torn him
can not have no power over him because that he fyndeth no place for him. And
by this cause he departs and gooth away anon and leueth the same Relygyouse
in peace. To the contrary if he suffers and applies him self in evil works
/ the devil fyndeth anon a place for to keep him company. And all be it that
the te^hynge of god will often show him for to do good / nevertheless
withstanding his obstynate and frowardness she departs from him syghtely
and seueth him / wherefore it is of need / but if he will be lost / that with
all his heart he turn his affection unto almighty god. And thus doyeng the
said showing shall soon come to him again.

To an other young relygyouse that asked of an ancient holy fader / how long
a monk ought to labor / was answered by the said holy fader / unto the time
that he shall possess Ihesu Christ / because that he that has him in
possessyon / needs not to labor any ferther. Always he suffers his chosen
for to traueylle and labor / to the end that they shall have remembrance of
the labors of trybulacyon / and that they by this mean keep them fro sin
feeryng lest they should lose so great labors. We find also wryton / that
our lord made the sons of Ysraell for to traueylle and goo during the space
of.xl. year through the deserte / to the end that having mind of the
trybulacyons that they had there / they should have no will for to return
thereat.

An other brother questyoned an au^cyent fader and asked him the cause which
Relygyouses at this time present labouryng get not thereby some grace as did
the aeged Relygyouses. To whom the old fader answered / that charity was
then so great / that euerychone by virtuous works drew his neighbor on
high / but now all the world applies them to ylle / and every one ledeth
his neighbor in to hell And for this cause there nys none that geteth any
grace.

By an other young Relygyouse was required unto an aeged fader / that he should
tell him if he wist not that the holy men had knowloge of the grace of god when
it comes to them. Where at he answered / that they know it not always. And
for an open exemple of this thing he leyde unto him / that ones a dyscyple of
an old holy fader / had^ done oo sin / for the which the said holy fader
moeued with ire against him / crynge sharply had said unto hy^ Goo that you may
deye. And anon this dyscyple fell deed to ye earth. And when the said holy
fader see him deed he was touched with a meruayllouse dread. So set he him
self to pray god by great humylyte saying. O Ihesu christ my lord and my god.
I beseech the that it will please the to reyse this poor Relygyouse. And I
promise the yt I shall never speak such words without great consyderacyon.
And Incontynente after his prayer y made his dyscyple wexed a live again all
sou^de and hole.

The abbot Poemen said that the man which techeth other / and does not as he
techeth / he is like unto the high well which fylleth with drink them that
be a thurst / or that wassheth the fylth away of every one / but it can not
wasshe him self nor purge the fylthes that are in it self. And morouer he
said that a man which desires to be virtuous ought to styre and teache his
soul to keep and observe those things which his tongue leueth unto other. For
it is a thing much to be blamed and worthy of great Repreuyng to a man whom he
presumes to correct other folk of some sin or evil deed / whereof he is
him self worthy to be Rebuked for it. Wherefore it behooves of necessyte unto
him that well will teache or edyfye some other / that first he correct his own
self / ensyewyng the doctrine of our sovereign master and techer Ihesu Christ
/ the which living virtuously as men find it written in the truth and holy
scryptures / showed first exemple of good life / and then after he began to
preche. And for this cause his predycacyons were so agreeable to those that
after the holy faith desired to live / that they forsake all worldly things
for to ensyewe him and live after his holy exortacyons which were of a great
and wonderful effycacye / pryncypally because of the fair and right honest
live that he led.

An holy hermyte some time yede toward the holy fader Poemen which received
him with great gladness. And after that they had enbraced each other / the
hermyte began to speak and to common with him of holy scryptures / and namely of
thoo things that be heavenly. And then the holy fader Poemen heryng his
proposycyons / and how be it that he was well settred and sore expert he
turned his face toward an other brother as though he would not here the said
hermyte nor give to him any answer The hermyte then seeing that he would not
harken at him by no wise went out of the celle of the said Poemen all on
angered / and said to his dyscyple. I am well sorry to have for naught and without
cause entreprysed the labor of so great away when he for whom I am come and
that I desired so fervently for to see wylnyth not speak to me. The dyscyple
heryng this came to the holy fader Poemen and said to him. Haa fair fader /
that worshypfull hermyte that now depart from before the / is come hither for
to see the / and he has so good Reno^mee and so great Joy in his country /
and thou will not speak with him. Then answered the holy fader Poemen. He of
whom thou spekest will dyspute of the sovereign and heavenly things. And I
that am an erthely man I can with great pain speak of the things that be
erthely. If he had spoken unto me of the passions of Relygyouses happily I
would have answered him thereupon / but if he will speak of the heavenly things
I can naught answer him thereof / for I confess my self not suffysaunt
thereunto. Then the dyscyple Retournyng the hermyte said to him. O man of god
/ our fader Poemen will not speak to the of these high questyons / but when
men speak unto him of the wretchydnesse and passions that must be suffered and
endured in this world / and how pacyently they must be borne / he speaks
thereof gladly. The hermyte then taken with sadness by the words of the said
holy fader / came to him again saying. O holy man / counseylle me what I ought
to do for to withstonde against my passions / which Reygne over me and keep me
so wonderfully subgette. The holy fader herynge his words and beholdynge upon
him Ioyously said unto him Now thou art welcome unto me / I shall at this
hour open my mouth and shall fylle it with thy virtuous goods. The good
hermyte taking a courage to his words said unto him. In good sothe fair
fader Poemen / good and true is the way that thou take. And after that they
had a long wyle devised togydre of many things profitable and necessary to
the edyfycaco^n and health of their souls / the hermyte yeldyng unto him
graces and thanks / retournyng unto his own Regyon again.

Men find that an other aeged holy fader said to his dyscyple. If any body
speaks to the of holy scryptures or of any other thing / be not therefore
willing to chyde nor strive against him. And if he says well / be you of his
opinion / and if he speaks evil / you shall tell him in this manner. My friend
look well what you say. And to this purpose said the postle / be not wyllyng
for to strive by words. And in keeping thyself fro the same you shall be
verayly meke / and also you shall eschew the hate of other. And by the
contrary / if stryuyng and chydyng you suffer in thyn opinion and will abide by
thy word / a sclaunder and great inconuenyence shall follow thereby. Also when
men praise over much a body him Iustyfyeng there comes often of it questyon
and debate. And therefore my sone you ought to be certain / that of what someuer
thing that you take noise for / you shalt ever have some noyouse lettyng for
it / and never shalt you be in peace. So ought you then above all things to
set thyn affection and understanding to keep silence and to be still. And by
this mean you shalt have ease of some thing. And also you must think both
erly and late to that you have to do / and you shall not dread the assawte or
entycynge of thyn enmyes. For as saint Jerome says / a man that is occupyeth
in good work / is oonly tempted of one devil / and a man that is idle has
about him more than a thousand deuyls for to begyle and deceive him / to
the end yt he may be brought to dampnaco^n. And therefore it is needful to a
man that will live virtuously to occupye the time holyly / other to read or to
do other thing / and when he is noyouse to redyng / he ought to set him self
to oryson / and from oryson to return for to read again or to wede and pluck
the evil herbs out of his gardyn. And in this doyneg he shall overcome his
enmyes and shall withstand all deceytes and temptacyons of the devil.

An other brother questyned ones an old fader askyng hy^ how long must one
keep hy^ still. And the holy fader answered to hy^ / till the time yt he be
questyoned or aposed / and in all place where you shall be / if you keep silence
/ you shall be in tranquylyte and peasyble rest.


THe abbot Poemen techyng his relygyouses said / that all thus as yt be
whersoeuer she flies she is occupied about making of honny. In likewise a good
Relygyouse where soever that he gothe if it is for to do some good work / he
shall lyghtely fuldoo the sweetness of good and virtuous works / when he
shall apply him self for to know the good deeds and graces of the creator
as well the spyrytuall as tho that been temporal.



THe holy fader Mutues and a relygyouse of his own coming from a place
called Ragythan / went ones in to the parties of Gebolon. The bishop of that
land seeing the abbot Mutues and knowing his great virtues made him for to
come unto him against his will ordained him to the holy ordres of preesthode.
And after taking with him his refeccyon corporal / to him said the said
bishop. Holy fader I pray the pardonne me that I have compelled the for to
take the ordres of preesthode. Certaynely I know well that thou had not
appetyte nor no desire to such a worship / but I desiring to receive thy
blessing. I have presumed in my self for to constrayne the to the same
ordres. To whom this holy fader with great humylyte answered / that his courage
desired it not / but he was somewhat careful of that he must be departed from
his brother that was with him which was no priest / and him self alone could
not acomplysshe his orysons. Thereto answered the bishop and said / that if he
wist his felawe worthy to be made a priest / he should ordeyne him to the holy
ordres of preesthode. The said holy fader answered. If he be worthy that can I
not tell certainly / but this I wot well / that he is better and more
suffysaunt than I am. In effect the bishop consecrated him to be a priest.
And in this astate they dwelled togydre all their life / but nevertheless they
presumed never for to apply them self to the altar for to consecrate nor
sing mass. And the said holy fader said. I trust in my god my maker / and of
this I call him to a witness / that I bylyue me not worthy to be a priest nor
to consecrate him. For this thing apperteyneth to be done oonly by them that be
Just / pure / and 'clene without greyt or Infyrmyte of sin. And I know and
perceive well that I am not such / wherefore if it pleases his dyuyne bou^te /
he shall have me for excused.

A Relygyouse Required humbly Saint Macharye that he would give and grant him
some good Instruccyon / by which he might get his salvation. To whom he
answered. It is necessary to the Relygyouse which desires to be saved to
flee the company of men and to keep him self within his celle there for to
weep over his sins contynuelly / and with this he must be garnysshed with a
virtue which is above all other that is to wit / to Refrain his tongue and
his belly.


THe abbot Arsenyen dwelling in ye paleys of the emperor / he being yet a
seculer / prayed our lord god saying. Sire god creator and redemer of ye
world please yt to show to me a way by the which I may be saved. And he
herd a voice yt said to hy^ in this manner. Arseny flee the company of men /
and you shall come to yt ye you desyrest and requyrest. So forsook he all worldly
things / and went to dwell in a solytary place / where daily he made to god
a like prayer. And he herd again a voice yt said to him. Arsenye flee / speak
not / rest thy self / and in this doing you shall have the pryncyples and
begynnynges for to come to the way of salvation. Within a certain time after
came unto hy^ a bishop named Theophyle desyryng to see hy^ / and to here of hy^
some good word edyfycatyue to whom and to all them yt were with him / the
holy fader sdyd. If I tell or teache you any thing that be to your profit /
shall you keep it. Certainly ye said they togydre. Then said he spekyng of
hy^ self. I Require you humbly that in what soever place where ye shall know
or here say that Arsenyen is / ye shall not come nor find your self there in
no wise. After this the said bishop would come there again / so sent he
first toward him for to wit if he would open to him his door and he sent
him word again / if he came alone he should give unto hy^ openyng / but and he
came acompanyed with many folk / he should not find hy^ in his celle. For
certainly he should depart and should dwell there no more. The which thing
y herd and understand by the said bishop / he dyfferred his partynge /
ferynge that if he should have gone there / he should have be cause to make him
forsake the place of his hermytage. An other time he found him self with some
of his brethren in a place where grew much read / which by force of wind
moeued sore here and there betyng each other so that they made great noise.
So demanded he to his brethern whereof grew that noise that he herd in that
place. The which answered and said / that it was the wind that made thus the
read to beat the one against the other. Then he said unto them. Now my
brethern consydere how much hard athynge it is to live in peace and
tranquylyte in this world. If ye were in a place where ye should here all
oonly a bird sing / ye should not have your corages nor entendementes with
rest / how should you have them then peasyble among the noise and tempest of
this read seen the great and wonderful noise that they make because of the
wind that makes them this to smite each other. And some said that the celle
or dwelling of this foresaid holy fader Arsenyen stood.xxx. mile fro the place
where the said read were. From which dwelling he went but little out / but
by some Relygyouses were admynystred unto him his needs and necessytees.
Morouer it is found written of him that when the place in Sychye where in the
holy faders did dwell was them left / and he him self coming out of the
same he began to weep saying that the world had lost Rome / and the
Relygyouse hermytes Sychye.

Some brethern going out of Alexandrye in to the parties of Thebayde for to
bye there some flax / because that the holy fader Arsenyen dwelled that time
in the said parties of Thebayde / concluded togydre / sith that they had
occasyon to goo nyghe the place where he dwelled / that they should goo see and
vysyte him. And they did so. And after that his dyscyple had told him that
they were come toward him / he charged him that he should ask them the cause
and occasyon wherefore they came there. So brought he unto him word again
that the cause and occasyon of their coming was such as above is said. The
good holy fader Arsenyen herynge this answer / said in this manner. Certainly
sith that they be not come here for me / but oonly for their own affairs. I
will not that they see me. And therefore thou shall goo to Receive them and
shall serve them as well as thou may And this done and acomplysshed / thou
shalt take leave of them saying thus unto them / yt I should not go to them for
because of my great wekenesse and feblenesse.

An other brother desyryng for to see the said holy fader Arsenyen transported
himself unto his celle and knocked at the door for to have gone in. The holy
fader made hy^ openyng wenyng to him that it had be his dyscyple / but all
incontynente that he saw it was not he / he casted himself done to the earth
/ the which thing seeing the Relygyouse he was sore abashed / and prayde him
humbly that he would arise / which he would not / but said / that he should
not arise till that the said Relygyouse were gone again fro thens / the which
nevertheless prayed and required him many times that he would arise / but he
would never grant nor consent thereto unto the time that he were departed and
gone. Sometime the deuyls of hell came to him and made him endure many
trybulacyons and aduersytees within his celle And upon a time among other the
brethern that were wont to bring him such things as he had need of came
there and herd this holy fader that cried and said to our lord. Alas my god
my fader creator and Redemer leave me not. And where it is so that I have not
yet done any good yt be worthy to be presented before the. I beseech the humbly
as much as I can / that after thy great mercy and benygnyte / it will please
the at the least to grant unto me that I may undertake the begynnynges of
good living. The said holy fader Arsenyen questyoned and asked ones a simple
brother of the land of Egypt / asking of him how he feled him self in his
cogytacyons and thoughts. The which thing seeing a brother that was of
understanding more ready than was ye other said thus to him. Fair fader I
merueylle me of thy self that art so expert not oonly in greek tongue / but
also in latin tongue / how thou aposest and questyoned this brother Rustyke in
asking of his thoughts and cogytacyons / whereat he answered. I know well
that I have studied and learned suffysauntely as to the world both the latin
tongue and the greek / but yet have I not conne take nor learn the ABC of this
Rustyke.

Some old holy faders told that ones some persons gave and sent unto the
brothern hermytes of Sychye a quantyte of dates. And because there was but a
few / they did not send none of them to the fader Arsenyen / doubtyng yt he
should take it an wrong or a mock to have sent him so little a gift. And
when he was showed hereof / he would not goo out of his celle for to goo to the
dole with the other brethern as it was acustomed to be do / but said to them.
Ye have excomunycated me my brothern / to the end that ye should not give me the
charity that god has sent unto you / of the which I have not be worthy to
have had my part. They all then understanding these words were wonderfully
edyfyed of his humylyte. So sent they unto hy^ by one of them which was a
priest his part of the said dates / and brought him with hy^ Joyful in the
co^pan^e of the other for to take up the said dole. And some said yt he was so
secret in his deeds and operacyons / that men could never perceive ne know
the manner of the conuersacyon of his life. He dwelling in the parties of
Egypt because he suffered and bare there grievously the needs of the folk that
toward him came for to vysyte and see him / he purposed for to give up and
leave his celle or little house without to bear away with him any thing that
was in it. And thus came he to his dyscyples whereof one was named Paranytas /
ye other Alexander and the third Zoyle. So said this holy fader Arsenyen to
Alexander. Arise Alexander and dyspose thy self for to row. To Zoyle he said
/ come with me unto the flode and seek a boat for me to go in to Alexandrye and
take also an ore with thy brother to row over. Zoyle was wroth of these
words and held his peace. And thus were they departed one from the other.
Always he went all alone unto about ye parties of Alexandrye where he ley
syke of a gryuous sykenesse. And his dyscyples yt he had thus left complained
togydre and said the one to ye other. Has not one of us made our old fader
Arseny angry / ye which for this cause should be thus departed and separed
from us. And in spekyng and deuysynge togydre they could not know nor ymagyne
the cause of his anger nor of his heaviness / another also yt ever they had be
to him dysobeyssaunt in any thing. After yt the holy fader Arsenyen was heled
of his sykenesse / he thought in him self yt he should go vysyte and see his
brethern the which he had left. And after rowing to and fro he came to a
place ye called was the stone where were ye said mynysters And as he walked a
long ye said streme there came night to him a maid of Egypt yt plucked out
her small pappes / whereof the holy fader as ill apayde for it began to rebuke
her sharply. Whereat she answered unto him yt if he were a monk that he should
go to the montayne. The holy fader felyng him self stengyd and prycked in his
courage of the words of the said daughter / did note and took good head to
the same words saying in him self. If thou be a monk / goo to the montayne.
And he being in this co^punccyon / his two dyscyples Alexandre and Zoyle came
toward him / which in contynente casted them self tofore his fete / and he
in likewise before them did put him self done to the earth / and began to
weep all three togydre. The holy fader said syn to them / have not ye herd
tell that I was syke / the which answered ye. And why said he are you not
come to see me. Whereat Alexander answered / because yt thy departing from us
had not be unto us agreeable. For many one by reason of ye same have be evil
pleased with us / sayng yt if we had not be dysobeyssau^t unto the / you
sholdest never have departed thy self from with us. Then said the holy fader
Arsenyen to them. I have well known yt this should be said. But yet again men
shall say truly yt the dove which could not f^nde where upon to rest her
fete / returned again toward Noe being within his arche. The which words
herd of his dyscyples / they were well content with it and peased their
corages. And dwelled ever after with him unto the last time of their lives.

The holy fader Besaryon and a dyscyple of his walkyng in the deserts / came of
adventure upon a deep pytte in which they entered and they found there a
brother syttyng and werkyng about the making of a cord. The which like as he
had be both do^me and blind another spoke nor looked not upon them. This
considering the holy fader Besaryon / said to his dyscyple / let us go hens /
for this old fader will not speak with us. So went they their way and went
toward the abbot Johan. And soon after retournynge to the said pytte / the
said holy fader Besaryon said. Let us goo there in on^s again for to speak
with that brother so shall we now wit if god had kept him that he spoke not
to us. And incontinent yt they were entered within the said place / they found
nothing therein but oonly a deed body. Then calling upon his dyscyple / he
said in this manner. Come hither my brother / let us dress this corpse / for
god has sent us here therefore. And where they besyed them for to have put a
wyndyng shete about him / they found yt it was a woman / whereof they
merueylled greatly and said. Here is a thing merueyllouse to see how the women
fought ayenste the deuyls and overcome them. And after yt they had buried her
they went away and praised the name of god pretoctour and deffender of all
things.

Saint Mecharye told ones to his Relygyouses / that toward him were come two
brethern the one was old and the other very young / the which having of hy^
no knowloge / but oonly by ^eno^me / they had questyoned him / asking of him
where was the celle of the abbot Macharye. And he enquyryng of them why they
asked after it / they answered yt they having knowledge of his virtuous works
and holy life desired soueraynly to see him. And where the said saint Macharye
confessed yt he was the man yt they sought they incontinent fallygh before his
fete requyryng and besought him yt he would suffer them to enhabyte with him /
but he seeing and Iugyng by considering of their gifts and habylymentes / yt
by habondau^ce of rychesses / they were wanton and delycate / he answered yt
they might not abide with him. The which answer y herd / they said to him yt
if they might not dwell with him always they had purposed to seek for their
resydence some other solytary place The holy fader heryng their words /
thought in him self / that if he departed or shoued them back agay^e from him
/ he might have be sclau^dred thereby. And consyderyng the great labor that
they had take for to come to him / he thought yt he should give them no cause
in this behalue to noise ayenste him. So said he to them. Come on my childern /
and if ye may / make and build here your celles and habytacions. They much
Ioyouse of this answer / required him / yt he would assygne them ye place
where his pleasure was yt they should make their lodgyng / and he took unto
them a tubbe an a^e and a sack full of bread with a little salt / and this done
he brought the^ upon a roche of hard stone sayng to the^ yt they should dygge
therein for to make there their habytaco^n and little houses / which they
should cover with claye / always ye intenco^n of saint Macharye was such /
that they should be weary for to be besy about that work and yt they for great
werynes should leave it and go away. But they yt had purposed to abide there /
asked of him what occupacyon the other brethern had of custom to do there. And
he answered that they made cords. And syn pared to them both palms and leaves
and of the pylles thereof / he showed and taught to them ye manner for to make
and weue cords / and also for to make baskettes and maundes / the which
mau^des he warned them to give unto the servants for to receive bread therein.
And thus he left them and went his way. And they after this with a great
pacyence did that the said saint Macharye commanded them / and kept them
self within their celles and habytacyons / and went not toward him during
the time of three year. But because that many Relygyouses of far Regyons came
toward saint Macharye foresaid / he meruaylled by how these two brethern kept
them so long together yt they came not toward him / seeing namely that after
yt he had left them in that place he was not gone to them / and had not seen
them but in ye church perceyuyng with silence the holy sacrament of the altar
as the other did. Desiring then to know the troth of their co^uersacyon /
he set him self for to fast an hole weke / prayeng our lord yt his pleasure
were to show unto him their deeds And after he went toward them and
incontinent that they had made hy^ openyng they cast themself do^ne at his
feet and worshypped him in silence full hertely. After they set them all
three to oryson as it was of custom / and after their prayers y made / saint
Macharye set him done. Then the old made a token to the young yt had
set him done their and without any speaking made cords / yt he should goo
out / and he did so / and about the hour of none he came again. And the
eldest made to him an other token as before the which y perceived departed and
went out yet again and made redye such vytaylle as they had for their
refeccyon the which was of three small loves that were baken between ashes
which he brought upon the table and set himself done again there making
with the other brother his work ever stylle without any speaking. So called
them saint Macharye unto him saying to them. Arise and come ete. And they did
so. And this saint Macharye drank water out of a little vessel where out
they were accustomed to drink out. The table y voyded and the even coming to
hand / they asked him if he would goo his way. Whereat he answered / that he
would rest there / wherefore in a corner of their celle or habytacyon they made
lyghtely ready a matte. And they as willing for to take their night rest in
an other corn^^ they did cast there their gyrdels a^^ vestymentes. And as ye
two brethern dysposed them self for to sleep / the holy man Macharye put him
self again to pray god that he would show hy^ their works / and suddenly
the couerture of their celle opened and apperyd therein a light full bright that
lyghtned all the place as it had be fair none days / the which light
nevertheless they perceived not But anon after wenynge yt the holy fader had
be a sleep / they rose and blessed them self and after set himself to
oryson heuyng their hands toward heaven. And in this dooyng the said holy
fader Macharye beheld well their co^tenau^ces / so covertly yt they could not
perceive it. He then beholding them saw Incontinent come a multitude of
deuyls in likeness of flies yt would tarry and set them self upon the eyes
and upon the face of the young brother / but they durst not goo nyghe the old.
And anon came there the angel of god armed with a glauye bre^nyng as a
brounde of fire / the which come about this young relygyouse / made them so
wonderfully afraid that he threw them all out. And when the morning came
toward / they leyde themself do^ne again upon the earth for to rest them And
then saint Macharye as suddenly awaked rose up / and in likewise did ye two
other brethern. And the old asked him if he would that they should sing twelve
psalms / to yt which thing consentyng ye holy fader / the young brother sange
five psalms with six verses and one Alleluya. And at every verse came out of
his mouth a bronde of fire that ascended unto heaven. And in likewise out of the
mouth of the old / even as he moeued his lyppes for to sing psalms there
came as a little cord enfla^med ye Retched unto heaven. Morouer after that the
holy fader had songen a little taking his leave of them / he Required them
instantly that they would pray god for him but without in any wise to speak
they casted themself tofore his fete. All the which things reherced this
holy saint Macharye / the which also said that he had known / yt the oldest
was parfyte in the dread of god / and the young to be yet tempted and befought
of the deuyls. And with this said he / this oldest brother within a little time
after to have be deceassed and taken from this world in to paradyse / and that
other in like wise to have followed him thereunto three days after.

The abbot Moses said to his brethern admo^nestyng them yt a relygyouse ought
pry^cypally and souereynly to keep and observe four things. The first is yt he
must keep his tongue. The second he must keep ye commandments of god
The.iij. he must meke hy^self. And the iiij. he must steadfastly and
perseuerau^tly ye sharpnes of pouerte. And with this it is of necessyte to a
monk that ever he must weep / having contynuall Remembrance of his sins and
that at all hours he have death before his eyes.

Many holy faders gadred together prophesied ones of the last generacyon /
among the which one named Isquyrien that was pryncypall and the first among
them said. We fulfylle yet the commandments of god. The other heryng his
words asked him. They yt shall come after us / what shall they do whereat he
answered / they shall fulfill happily ye half thereof / and so shall they require
ye god euerlasty^g / soon after they axed hy^ / and after ye same / ye other
yt shall come after them what shall they do. He answered yet again. The men of ye
self generacyon shall not do no works of the commandments of god / but
shall forgete them. And then shall ouerflowe all wickedness / and charity
shall be cold / and upon them shall come grievous temptaco^ns. But they yt
shall be approved in the same and fou^den steadfast and constau^t / shall be taken
for better men than we and our faders have be / and also more approved in all
their works.

A Relygyouse desyryng for to dwell in the company of other Relygyouses
Requyryng unto the holy fader Agathon that he would teache him how he should
behave him self among them To which the holy fader answered / that he should
keep above all things that even such as he should show himself at his
entryng with them / he should ever show him that self man / abiding in all
humylyte unto his last days.

Some time the Maziniens made war against them of Sychye / and they coming in
that land / slew many of the faders yt were there. So departed theris for
this cause the abbot Poemen the abbot Nub and five other aeged the which came
to a place called Therenetude / where they found a temple old and broken
wherein they dwelled by seven days and till yt they knew where either of them
should dwell in Egypt. The abbot Nub yt was most old of them all said to
them / that him seemed to be good / that they should dwell ^o weke every man by
himself alone without to speak the one to the other / and they did so. And
it happed this hangyng yt the abbot Nub saw within ye said temple ye stature
of an Ydole / and every morning the said abbot Nub rose and casted stones at
hit / and syn at even he Required her pardon / the which thing he continued
all the same weke. And when the satyrdaye came that made an end of that weke /
these holy faders coming again togydre / the abbot Poemen demanded of the
abbot Nub why he had all that weke beten thus yt self Ydole / sayng to him /
that he meruaylled much / how he that was a dyscrete man and full of very
faith had done so and namely of that he asked her pardon after that he had
beten her / whereat the holy fader Nub answered that he had done that for the
edyfycacyon of himself and of them all / saying thus. Have ye not seen how
this Ydole when I have beten her she has not grutched nor said nothing there
against / and in no wise she has not angered her self. And again when I have
besought her pardon / she has not exalted or praised her self for it.
Certainly it is truth said the abbot Poemen. Now my brethern said ye abbot
Nub I shall tell you / it semet me that we seven if we dwelled togydre / we
should do much more fruit / than if we were parted ye one fro ye other / but
it is needful that this Ydole be set tofore our eyes for an exemple / in
such wise / that if the one of us is in any wise wronged / he might not be
angry for it / and also if men ask him pardon yt he booste nor praise himself
thereof. And if ye will not do so. I say after mine advise that it is best that
every of us goo dwell by himself alone where he shall seem hy^ most good. The
other heryng his words laid them self done to the earth before him and
promised that they should do so. And by this means they dwelled togydre by
many years in great humylyte and pacyence. They took their rest during four
hours oonly. By other four hours they song psalms / and during other four
hours they labored / and after unto none time they gadred and pared palms
and leaves / and this done they gadred some herbs and made them ready for their
mete to live there upon.

Men find also that seven other hermytes right aprouyd men dwelled sometime in
an hermytage nyghe the marches of ye sarrasyns / and had their celles and
habytaco^ns y set not one far fro the other / but also they were
wou^derfully Joined and knytte togydre by the bound of charity. The one of
them was called Peter that other Stephen / the.iij Johan / and the.iiij. George
/ the fyfthe Theodore / the.vi. Felix / and the.vij. Laurence. This hermytes
then dwelling in a place wild and barayne / and as inhabytable to men / had
of custom yt they co^^noued togydre ones in a wyke for to see each other. And
for to do this upon the satyrdaye ever about the hour of none either of them
departed out of his own place for to come unto ye place common where they
should find each other / and every man brought there with hy^ of such as he
had / the one brought some nuttes / ye other some letues / an other some fygges
/ and the other brought other fruytes and herbs couenable for their living /
and commonly and pryncypally they each none other thing. And as for bread oil
and drink if they had at some season any / yt was over and above their
customable pytau^ce / for they sustained their own bodies oonly of the fruytes
and herbs above said. And in that place where they were was found no water
and they drank none other thing but of the dew yt fell done from the heuens
which in great habondau^ce fell upon the herbs. The which dew the holy
hermytes going in the morning thrughe the wood took it up and drank it. And as
to the regard of their vesture / their clothes were made of leuys and palms
togydre weued. And when they did find them self at place where they should
co^mone togydre every satyrdaye as before is said / they all took there their
repast whereof they gave graces and thanks unto our lord god. This done / unto
the hour of euynsonge time they talked and devised togydre of holy scryptures
without to speak of any fables or vain words another of ye cure of business
of the world / nor of the shewynges or deeds of the erthely things / but
besely they spoke and talked of the right desyrable royalme of paradyse / of
the bliss that is to come / and of the unspeakable glory of the Just / of the
horrible pains which is ordained for sinners / and of the rest of the
gloryouse saints which all ready rejoice them self in the blessed setes of
heaven and And remembryng these things in their minds / they gaaf great
sobbynges out of their herter / and wept with great plenteuousnesse of teeres.
And after this yt during all ye night they had song devout songs unto our
lord / the sunday following about the hour of none they set their deuyses
and talkynges at an end for all that wyke yt was next coming / and eueryche of
them went again in to his own celle or little house where they being alone were
ocupyde both day and night to the service of god. They then in this manner of
living setting their corages and affeccions / the sarrasyns in great multitude
ra^ne over ye deserte and found them there and hunted them out / and yet not
content with this they hang them by the fete doing to them great wrongs and
shameful dyspytes. And fynably they being thus hanged / the sarrasyns made a
fire of herbs grene and bitter under them / whereof they were so cruelly
tourmented / that of the bytternesse of the smoke / they lost the light of
their eyes And after that in this manner and other much cruel / they had thus
scorged and tourmented them / they forsook and left them as half deed.

The abbot Poemen was questyoned by a Relygyouse askyng him what be tokenen the
words that our lord says in the gospel which are such. No greter love can
have no man / than he alone that lies his soul for his friend. How said the
brother may this thing be done. To the which askyng the said holy fader
Poemen answered. If any man is wronged of his neighbor to whom he may
answer in likewise ylle again and yet he does not so / but where he is
moeued of courage to do so / he fyghteth against him self refraynyng his anger
in such wise yt he does to hy^ another gryffe nor harm be that so does
leyth his soul for his friend.

The abbot Moses said. If the works of a man be not according to his orysons
/ he trauaylleth him self for naught and in vain. And when some man prays
for him self to thentent that his sins be pardonned unto hy^ he ought to
keep him well yt he fall not to them again. Morouer when any man purposed in
him self never to fall in to sin again / and that in this will and purpose
he abides / that same man receives god Redely with great Joy.

A brother required an old fader asking him / what a man ought for to do that
he may withstonde the temptaco^ns yt shall come to him / and wicked thoughts
that the devil his foo does present unto him. Whereat the holy fader answered
to him / that he yt will withstand steadfastly the said temptacyons and wicked
thoughts / ought to complain himself unto the goodness of god / to the end yt
in socouryng him it will help him to preserve hy^ from the dangers of the
fend. For it is written / sith yt my god is my helper. I shall dysprayse mine
enmyes.

An other old fader said that like as the flies feere to come nyghe to the
pot when it is chaffed and sethyng / but and it be but luke warm they set
them self thereupon and bread worms thereon. In likewise the deuylles flee the
Relygyouse when he is beclypped and taken of the love of god / but and he be
slow / that is to say / if he love not god with all his heart and hole
affeccion / they pursyewe and deceive him by their dampnable and subtle
temptacyons.

The abbot Syluayn syttyng ones with his brethern in a cave where he held
himself was suddenly rauysshed from his spyryte / and in this rauyssheme^t he
was constrained to fall do^ne to the earth. And after long space of time
releuyng him self out of the same rauysshyng / he full sore began to weep. His
brethern questyoned him and asked what him eyled / but ever he wept still
without to answer them any thing / wherefore the said brethern prayed him so
besely that he would speak / so that by contynuyng of prayers he was
constrained to do so. And said unto them / that he being thus rauysshed and
his body a ground his ghost was brought to the Judgment of almighty god /
where he had seen many Relygyouses berynge their habyte / to have be condemned
and cast in to diverse tourmentes. And a great nombre of seculer men to have be
set and stablysshed in to the Royalme of paradyse. And this words said / he
took himself to weep again / thynkyng yt from ye hour forth on he should not
go out of his celle / the which purpose he enforced himself a long while to
keep and observe / for he went never out / but if he were compelled by
pryckynge of necessyte thereunto and yet when he went out of it / he covered his
face with a hode saying / that it was no need to a Relygyouse for to see the
light temporal / in which was nothing vtyle or proffytable.

An other Relygyouse exhortyng his brother / said unto him. My brother you ought
to think every day that death is nyghe / and like as you were all ready
enclosed within thy grave / you ought not to have any cure or business of ye
things temporal / but you ought in thy self to be ^esy and curyouse to keep
the dread of god / that it departed not out of thy heart. Morouer you ought to
believe yt in virtues or works virtuous you art the lest of all the other men
/ and you ought not to bacbyte / nor blame any man / for our lord knows all
things / and be peasyble in all thy deeds and our lord shall give the rest.

Some Relygyouses required saint Macharye that it would please hy^ for to teache
them how they should pray god. To whom mekely he answered. My brethern wit it
that ouermoche of words is not necessary for this to do. But ye ought by
feruente devotion to have your hands toward heaven and say Lord god almighty
/ as you will / and as it pleases to thy godhede so be it. And if any
temptaco^n or dysceyte assaylleth you / ye ought to say. Lord god right
pytefull and meke / please the to help us For you know this that to us is
needful / dyspose with us to thy pleasure after thy great mercy.

The abbot Johan said yt the monk or Relygyouse ought to be like unto a man
syttyng under a great tree / yt which lokynge upon horrible serpents and
other diverse bestes cruel coming ferfully to him for to grieve and hurt him
/ and where he can not withstand against them he gooth anon upon the tree /
and thus doing he is preserved and saved from them Likewise the Relygyouse
ought to set hy^ within his celle And if he sees that he can not withstand
against his temptacyons / dysceytes and wicked thoughts / that the devil his
great adversary brings forth tofore him / he ought Incontinent by devout
oryson to turn him self and run again unto our lord / to whom all things
ben possible / and he shall be saved. He said morouer / that the good
Relygyouse ought to be like a man having the fire at the lift side of him /
and the water at his right side The which when the fire takes hy^ with a
fla^me / he takes anon of the water that is nyghe and puts out the fire
therewith. In likewise it is necessary that the Relygyouse do the same at all
times / that is to wit when any evil thoughts shall be kyndled within hy^ by
the devil / he must then spring and cast water over them for to put out
them withal. By which water be understand devout and contynuell orysons
that he ought to make unto our lord. The which shall slay and put out this
wicked thoughts.

The abbot Zenon being in the deserts of Sychye / yede on a night out of his
celle and took himself for to walk through the wood so contynuynge three days
and three nyghtes in such wise yt he fell down to the earth as half deed for
great werynesse. And then aperyd unto him a child which had some bread in
his hand / and said to hy^ Zenon arise and ete. Anon he rose upon his fete
again and nevertheless he would not ete but set himself to pray god for he
doubted lest this apperyng had be some wicked fantasye. So said to him again the
child / thou have done well to pray god now arise and ete / to whom the holy
fader would not consenttyll that he should have prayed god the second time and
the third also. And where the child praised of yt he prayed god so
contynuelly / he then made an end of his oryson / and stood up and ete. And
this done the child said unto hy^ Thou have walked so long that you art gone
all ready far from thy celle / but come and follow me. And the holy fader did
so / and suddenly he found him self before his little house where he was
parted fro. Then said the child to the holy man yt he should enter his celle
for to pray god therein. And after these words said / the good hermyte entered
in to his celle / and the child vanysshed away.

The abbot Danyell said of saint Arsenye that every satyrdaye / he was so
contynuall in his orysons that he cessed not to pray till that he saw the
son turned behind his back / and yet abode thereat / heuyng up his hands
to heaven till that the mornyg was come again and that the son rysyng smote his
ey sight with his beams. And yet he passed the other night wakyng / but
toward the morning / when for to satysfye the freeltee of his kind / he was
constrained for to sleep a little / he called upon sleep and said / comhether
evil servant. And thus shettyng his eyes / he took all syttyng a little rest
/ and anon after he rose again.

The abbot Lucius being within a great pytte and deep / where he held him
self contemplatyuely / came there ones unto him certain hermytes or
Relygyouses that made themself to be called the bedemans. To whom by the said
holy fader Lucius was axed to what hand works they where wont for to occupye
them self. Whereat they answered / that they did no manner of temporal work.
But following the doctrine of saint Paul without Intermyssyon or lettyng they
prayed god Then he asked them again if they ete not. And they answered yes.
Yet he asked them / if they slept not / and likewise they said ye. And I ask
you then said the holy fader abbot / when ye ete / or sleep / who prays god
for you. To yt which questyon they wist not what they should answer. Then
he said to them. My brethern pardonne me. I see well by your answers / that ye
do not as ye tell me / saying that ye pray go^ without lettynge / but I will
show unto you / that in labouryng and werkynge with mine hands. I pray god
contynuelly / when by the aid of god I will take me to work. I do set me
done / and by me I do ley a quantyte of small palms of the which I pare of
the pylles and thereof I make mattes / and while I am besy about ye same I pray
saying to god in this wise. Sire have mercy of me after thy great mercy and
after the multitude of thy great mercyes forgive mine wickedness. I ask you /
if this to be said / is prayer or no. And they answered that it was a true
prayer. And sith again the holy fader Lucius said unto them / when I labor thus
thrughe out the day / and in labouryng I pray god. I get with my labor.xij.
or.xv. small penys / sometime more / and another time less / whereof I put
at door of my celle two penys for some poor body that happeth to come forby
first / and with the remenau^t I do bye this that is unto me needful for my
living. And my trust is / that he that takes my said almose prays god for me
when I ete or also when I sleep / or at lest by so much space of time as I
put in my repast taking or in slepyng / and by all thus the grace of god
helpyng. I trust god I do yt which holy scripture exhorts saying. Pray
without ceassynge.

The abbot Macharye upon a time among other beryng maundes of his making to a
mart for to be sold / found him self so sore weary because of the long way
/ that he was constrained to sytte done upon the earth for to rest him self
saying / my god you knoweste that I may no more go. And incontinent he found
himself by a river which he must pass over / which was yet sore far from
that place where he had set hy^ self done before when he made his complaynte.

The abbot Ammon departing from his celle for to go fette water at a well /
he found in his way a great serpente basylyque / and seeing yt he could not
eschew / but that ye say serpent should bring him to death / if he were not
keped there from of the grace of god / did set him self done before the
serpente foresaid saying to our lord in this wise. My god I know that I must
deye or else this best. And these words said / this basylyke by yt might of
god deyed suddenly all tered in pieces.

The abbot Besaryon and a dyscyple of his own walking togydre alonge the
shores of the sea / the said dyscyple was sore grieved with great thirst
because of the great he^e that was that day there. So was he constrained to
tell unto his fader in god Besaryon that his great thurst tormented him right
sore. The which thing heryng the holy fader / his oryson unto god Redely y
made / commanded him to take of the water of the sea for his drink. And where
he had dronken of it / he found it very sweet and good so filled he with it a
boteyll that he bare with him. The holy fader Besaryon seeing this said unto
hy^ / why haste thou filled thy boteylle with the same water. The dyscyple
feryng the holy fader answered Helas fader I require the of pardon I have be
so sore payned with thurst / that I feere me to fall thereat yet again. To
whom the said holy fader said. My sone god pardonne the the same / thou ought
to wit that god is every where / and he may give and grant the water good
and sweet in what soever place that he will / so that thou have a very love
and affection toward him and toward thyn even christian with very faith and
good hope in keeping his commandments.

An old fader reherced of a young man the which having a will for to be a man
of Relygyon / was of his mother sore let therfrom / but nevertheless she
could not do somoche there ayenste that she might turn him from his good
purpos sayng that he would save his soul / whereby fynably she consented
thereunto And after that he was received in Relygyon / he passed therein a part
of his yongthe in great ne^lygence of his soul. It happed then that his
mother deyed / and anon after her dyscease he fell syke with a gryuouse
sykenesse / during ye which his ghost was rauysshed and borne out of his body
for to be presented before the Judgment of god / there to receive the
punysshemente of his misdeeds / but in this rauysshyng / he saw his mother that
was in great sorrow and tourmentes with those that were there condemned. She
seeing there her son was wonderfully abashed / and said unto him. Ha my sone
and what is this / art thou here condemned for to suffer everlasting
tourmentes. Alas where ben the fair words / that thou saydest / when thou
would against my good will enter in to Relygyon / saying that in this manner
thou would do the saluaco^n of thy soul. Heryng the which words and seeing
the gryuouse tourmentes that his mother suffered / he found himself so overcome
and so abashed that he wist not what he should answer. And after this by him
seen and herd his ghost came in to his body again / and as by the will of god
it was suffered / he returned from his syknesse unto good health again. So thought
he in him self that this vysyon was to him by god and his mercy done / and for
this cause he sh^tt him self within his celle / thinking to enforce him self
there to his souls saluaco^n / which for to get / he made there great and
sharp penaunces for his sins and neclygences passed. And in effect he was
somoche bowed to wery^ and trauaylle his body there by pains and afflyccyons
/ that many one required him that he should not take so much upon him. And
namely because that ever without seassyng he wept and syghed / prayed him that
he should sometime absteyne himself from weeping to the end that he should not
lose his sight by it / or that he should run in to some other Inconuenyences.
But nevertheless he would not be comforted / saying that sith he might not
sustain no^ endure the Rebukes of his mother that he had seen in these wretched
and horrible tourmentes / with more great hardenesse and pain he should abide
or endure the wrath of god and of his saints at the day of his great
Judgment.

A Relygyouse was in Egypt much solytarye / and that among the other because
of his great humylyte / was sore famed. He had a sister yt lived wantonly among
men / the which was cause of the dampnacyon and loss of many one. So was this
Relygyouse oftentimes Required and pursyewed of diverse good men / that he
should goo toward her in the cite where she kept herself to the end yt by
means of his admonycyons he might do so much yt she would forbere and
withdraw her from such dampnable wantonness. And where he came to the place
openly where she held herself / a man of her knowloge went hastly toward
her and said. Here is thy brother that comes toward the She y moeued with
great gladness / leueyng her lovers which she would feign have pleased / with
her head all bare went out of her lodgys for to run against her brother /
where then she enforced herself for to have taken him in her arms and kiss
him / he said unto her. Alas my sister and my right dear friend. I pray the
that you will have pity upon thy soul in considering the great paryll in
which you lyuest where so many a wretchyd man through the occasyon of the is
perysshed / whereof at the last you shall and must suffer Infynyte pains for
it and tourmentes Intolerable. She heryng the words of her brother / and
shaking horrybly / thinking upon the same / began for to say unto him.
Alas my brother / thynkest thou that after so many euylles which I have done.
I might yet come for to get my souls salvation / Whereat he answered. I
ensure the my friend / if thou will do thy deuoyre / that lyghtely thou shalt
be saved. Then she casting her self at her brothers fete Required him
right besyly that he would led her with him there as she might do penance. And
then he answered unto her. My sister I will well / but goo first and couere
thy head / and then come after and follow me. To whom she said again. Goo
we my brother goo we. It is better for me to walk and goo among the men bare
head and all dyfformate / than for to Return to the sins abhomynable whereat
I have tysed them / And as they set them self for to walk togydre / her
brother excyted and warned her for to do penance. And seeing that some folk
met them by the way / he said to her My friend because that every man
knows not that thou art my sister / and to the end that we give none occasyon
to folk that goo by to think or say ylle / me seems to be necessary that
thou set thy self a little out of the way till that they be passed / and
then I shall call the again to me. The which thing she granted him with
a good will. And anon after when him thought that they should not mete no more
any folk / he called her to him again saying. My sister let us go our way.
And after that he had called her two or three times and she answered him not /
he went there as she was behind an hedge and found her deed / and found
also the train of her passes where she had tredde all full of blood because
that she had put of both her hosys and shone. And where as her brother had
showed this thing unto some of his brethern Relygyouses / they had among them
great doubt of her salvation / but our lord showed unto one of them / that
because that in walkyng she had forsaken ye flesshly desires and worldly
pleasurs / and by merueylouse contrycyon had set herself for to weep and to
complain upon the gryf^es of her sins. For this cause he had received
agreably her devout penance. Saint Athanasye obteynynge the archebysshopryche
of Alexandrye and dwelling there / many heretykes enforced themself for to
bespotte with their errors the holy faith of crystendom. And at this cause
for to have destroyde the said errors / he made saint Anthonye to come in ye
cite / which being there / an old blind man named Dydymus came toward him
which was well lettred and wonderfully taught in holy write. In spekyng and
dysputyng of which saint Anthonye meruaylled much of the great engyne and
understanding that this blind man had them. And gyuyng a laud to the
hyghenesse of his courage / askyng him if he was not heavy and sorry that he had
lost his bodily eyes. And where the same Dydymus shamefast and dyspleased with
it did not answer nothing to his askyng Saint Anthonye the second time and
also the third time questyoned him as before / but he answered him no more than
he had done at the first time / whereby he gave to know unto saint Anthonye
the heaviness that he bare in his courage to have lost the bodily light. Then
saint Anthonye this knowing said in this manner. I meruayll me how a man
prudente and sage may be sorry of the damage and loss of that thing which the
pyssemyers the bees and the flies have where as they should be glad of that
thing which the postles and other saints have deserved to have. Verily it is
a better thing and more great to see with the spyrytuell eyes / than with the
bodily eyes / and to possess rather such eyes / by the which a sin as
little as for to take up a straw can not be done / than the eyes that by one
oonly look of concupyscence may make a man to fall in to ye gry^nes of death
with tormente everlasting.

A Relygyouse dwelling in the deserts of Nytrye which was more sparynge than
a couetouse man / not taking head that our lord was sold for.xxx. penys /
left behind him when he was deed a hundred shelyng which he had spared with
weuyng of clothes. The relygyouses his neighbors that dwelled in the same
deserts as two or thremyle one from an other / had togydre counseyll / what
they ought for to do with this hundred shelyng. Some of them said that men
ought to deal it to the poor folk for gods sake / some said that it
should be given to the church / and some said that they ought to send it to
the parents of the foresaid relygyouse yt was deed. But saint Macharye / the
holy fader Pambo / saint Ysodore and some other holy faders being at the
same counseyll and spekyng out of the mouth of the holy ghost decerned and
concluded that it should be buried with their master that had spared them /
saying. Thy money be with the to thy loss and destrucco^n. And to the end that
this thing be not thought cruelly done. It is to be noted / that by this was
moeued such a feere and so great a dread among all the monks and
Relygyouses of the land of Egypt / that every of them thought a right great
and abhomynable sin in a man to leave only oo shelyng after his death.

A young stryplyng borne of Greece became a Relygyouse in the deserts of Egypt.
And how well that he was sore abstynente and made lene his body with paynfull
fastings / great labors and long watchynges / nevertheless he could not
put out in him the mocyons of flesshely concupyscence. And where this thing
was showed unto the fader abbot of his monasterye / he found the manner for to
preserve him therfrom by such a mean. He commanded to a great man much
hughe and sore hard / that he should goo chyde fyersly / and say many great
wrongs to the said Relygyouse / and that yet after great shame said and done
to him / he should not give him leave to scuse him self / but should ever
continue his blames and complayntes ayenste him / the which thing this man
Incontinent fulfilled. And for to moeue and trouble more the said young
Relygyouse / all be it that he was not gylty of the shames that he said by him
/ he called some persons for to be present when he spoke unto him such
shames / the which as they had be learned before held with the sklaunderar
and bare out his deed to the blame of the poor Relygyouse and Innocente. Where
by he considering the great outrage and shame of the wrongs that him were
laid upon against all truth / took him self for to weep and syghe so sore
that it was great wounder. And continued his teeres a long space of time as he
that was Replenysshed other fulfilled with much great heaviness and put from
all aid and socoure and other comfort as to him seemed. But that he Returned
to god his creator and Redemer / unto whom lyenge flat and casting him
self to the earth / he made Right sorrowful and bitter complayntes of the
great wrongs Iniuryes and Rebukes which wrongfully and without a cause had
be put upon him. And he continued this life well an hole year the which
ended and acomplysshed / this young man was questyoned and asked / how he bare
him self touching his lecherouse temptacyons / and if he was passyoned
therewith any more bycau-of them. Where unto he andswered and said unto them.
Alas when it is not honest for me for to have aptyte to live longer / and that
I ought to desire my self deed for ye great shames that have be laid upon me /
how should I remember of any lecherouse appetyte to be within me / as he would
have said / that detraccyon which Iniustly had be done over him / had taken
away from him all other cogytaco^ns and thoughts And by this mean the said
young Relygyouse was through the advise of the said holy fader saved and kept
from the said temptacyons / and came syn again casely to the right way when he
knew that the said wrongs had be done to him for to make him for to forgette
the temptacyons above said.

Here after consequently follows a little book or treatise conteynyng many
instruccyons for folk of Relygyon and other contemplatyue / how they owe to
behave them self yt one with the other / and to profit in Relygyon / which
begins in latin Interrogauit etc.


A Relygyouse Required the abbot Anthonye that he would teache him how he might
sooneste please our lord. To the which Relygyouse the same abbot answered /
that to what soever place that he should goo / he should always have god before
his eyes / and that in the things that he should do / he should ever have the
wyenessynge and proving of the holy write / and that he should not be
unsteadfast / but in all places where he had to dwell / he should
perseuerantly abide thereat and not to depart suddenly therfrom. Tellyng
morouer unto him that in keeping and obseruyng curyously these three things / he
should purchase his salvation.

The abbot Pambo asking of the abbot Anthonye / how he ought to led him
self for to live virtuously. This anthonye said to him / trust not upon thy
holy life. Repent not of the thing that is passed where no remedy can not be
had to it. Refrain thy tongue from ouermoche and unprofitable langage and
keep also that thou fylle not thy belly.

Saint Gregorye said that our lord asks three things to be pryncypally kept
by every christian man / the first yt he have a very faith and keep it with all
his soul / the second yt he be true in his words / and the third yt he be
content and chaste of body.

Saint Euagrius said yt the mere yt is dyre and without craftly sauer as
fruytes herbs and rotys is a couenable ^^ete for men of Relygyon / and that
such mete bry^geth them to ye haven of saluaco^n Impassyble / yt is to say to
ye bliss that ever shall last without end. Again he said / that a Relygyouse
to whom the death of his fader was told / answered unto him yt brought him
this tidings. My friend leave of and blame no more my fader / saying by the yt
he is deed / for you say not well / because that I know well yt he is
Inmortall. By the which words / the said Relygyouse gave to understand /
that he reputed not him self to have an other fader than god.

The abbot Macharye asked to the abbot Zacharye what works ought a monk for
to do for to be holden and taken for a very Relygyouse. And how be it that the
said Zacharye would not answer to it / because yt him thought that the said
Macharye which was his elder / knew it better than he did him self.
Nevertheless he would obey him / and said as to his advise / that the man
ought to be taken for a true Relygyouse which yeldeth him self subget and
constrayneth him to endure all the necessytees and wrethchednesse of this
world.

Of the abbot Theodore otherwise called the ferme told some men / that among
his other virtues / he had these three which here after be declared. The first
is / yt he would not keep nothing. The second that he was wo^nderfully
abstynente. And the third yt he fled gladly the company of men and their
conuersacyon.

The abbot Johan Naue / for to exhort and learn all manner of folk to live
virtuously / said that a man ought to enforce him self to take and have in him
some what of all virtues. And therefore he said that in rysyng a morning he ought
to dyspose hy^ self to take of every virtue ye beginning / yt is to wit to
keep ye commandments of god / to be pacyent in his aduersytees / dread and
love god / to be strong in resystyng against the te^ptaco^ns of ye devil / to
be charytable / humble of heart and of thought / to co^tynue in oryson sorowyng
and weeping for his sins for to obtain of them remyssyon / to have a clean
conscience without envy or rancour / to be do^me when men should do to hy^ any
wrong louyngly without wrath / peasyble with out to yield evil for evil / but
good forylle without vayn glory / to hold himself ye lesser of the less /
to be sobre of yt tongue without evil to say / clean of eyes / to behave hy^
self humbly as subget unto every one / forsakyng all temporal goods and to
hy^ self / ever to fast suffer / weep / and to fight against ye devil and to
bear honger and thirst / to watch / to have both cold and hot / to keep
him self naked / and keep him self close within him self as within a tomb
or sepulcre like as he were all ready deed / and to know that death rydeth night
him every day.

The abbot Joseph thebeyn said yt there be three ordres or degrees of virtuous
men which be well agreeable unto god. The first is when a man is taken with
some gryfe or aduersytee / and during the same / some temptacyons come to him
/ to the which he with says yeldynge of all thanks and graces unto our
lord. The second degree is when all his deeds are clean before god without to
be entremed led with besynesses or worldly doings temporal / that is to say
/ that they be not bespoted with the fylthe of sin. The third when a man for
the worship of god entering in to Relygyon / gives his own propre will unto
his fader spyrytuall forsakyng all his own affeccyons and to the desires of
this world.

The abbot Cesyon told of an abbot named Johan yt was first and pryncypall
among the Relygyouses of his time / and yt had be a virtuous man in his live.
Speaking of the which he said that where he saw himself at the hour of
his death / steadfastly dysposed hy^self for to depart with all gladness
toward our lord. Many Relygyouse being about him and weeping / prayed him yt
he would leave to them by manner of a gift of charity some good word by the
which they might ascend to the perfeccyon which is in Ihesu christ. To whom
syghyng he said by manner as he would show them / that he never had done his
own will / and also he never taught nor warned no body to do any good work /
but he had done first the same him self.

An other brother questyoned an old fader askyng hy^ what good he might do
whereby he might have at the last everlasting rest. To whom the old fader
answered. God oonly knows what is good to be done / but always I have herd
say long agoo that one of our faders questyoned sometime the great abbot
Nestor which was synguler friend unto the abbot Anthonye / and asked him what
thing was to him necessary to be do for to be saved by it To whom this Nestor
answered / that all works were not like / laynge unto hy^ this that holy
scripture says / that is to wit that Abraham was an hospytaler and god was
with him. Helyas loved rest and life contemplatyue / and god was with him.
Dauyd was humble and god was with him. Then do as thyn own courage desires
after god / and keep well thy heart from evil thought.

The abbot named Pastor said / that to keep himself / to consydere himself and
to have dyscrecyon / these three things were the works of a good Relygyouse.

A Relygyouse axed him how a brother of Relygyon ought to entreat and behave
him self / whereat he answered We have seen Danyell in whom was found no manner
of accusacyon / but of the service that he did and made to his god.

Morouer said yet the said holy fader Pambo / that pouerte and trybulacyon are
couenable to a solytarye man And it is written / that he that desires to lead
such a lyffe / ought to have the condycyons of Noe / of Job and of Danyell.
For Noe would no thing possess. Job would here pacyently wounderfull
trybulacyons / and Danyell would dyscerne prudentely. If a man then have in
him these three condycyons / he shall lyghtely dwell with god.

Yet said the said Pambo that a relygyouse that shall have in a hate the
delectacyons of the flesh and vain glory / shall be lightly free and
delivered of the Illusyons and decepcyons of the world.

Some say of the said abbot Pambo / that at the hour of his death / he said
to the holy men yt aco^panyed hy^ such or like words. Sith yt I have be in
this solytarye place and yt I had build this celle where I dwell. I can not
remember that ever I ete bread / but yt I had gotten it with my labor. And also
I have not vttred nor spoken any word / whereof I have repented me of. And thus
I go to our lord / as I should begin to do to him any service.

The abbot Sysoyns said / care not if yt be contempned and despised / but cast
thy wylles behind thy back and make thy self free and sure from all worldly
cure to dyspysyng and putting them to naught / and thou shall have very rest.

The abbot James as he should decesse out of this world / said unto his
Relygyouses / keep your self that ye haunte ne common not with the heretykes /
and have no knowloge with the Iuges temporal / and be not curyouse for to
gadre worldly goods / but be Ready and bowed to forsake your understandings to
cou^seylle your neighbors / and your bodies to serve them.

A brother questyoned an old fader askyng hy^ how the dread of god may come in
a man. Whereat he answered. If a man is wyllefull poor and that he beware that
he Iuged not an other / he shall then have without fawte the dread of god.

An other said. If thou wylt live surely have with the humylyte / lack of
vytaylles / and plente of teeres.

An other aeged fader said. Beware thou do not to an other that which thou
would not be done unto. And if thou have hate or evil will against any body
that has said ylle of the / keep the that thou speak none ylle by him for it /
nor of none other. Also if you hate some body / do not to him therefore no
thing that is wrongful nor to none other. Morouer if thou hate any body that
has purchassed some harm unto the deceyuyng the or doing some shame to the /
or that takes away thyn own good fro the or that does to the some other
thing to the hurt of the / do not therefore unto no manner of person such a
thing. And who that shall keep these Instrucco^ns it ought to suffyse for to
get his salvation by them.

An aeged holy fader said / that the life of a good Relygyouse is dylygence /
obedyence / and to beware that he Judge no body / and to keep him from spekyng
and chydyng. For it is written. Ye that love our lord / hate malice. Then the
life of a monk is this. Not to acompanye with sinners / not to behold with
his eyes any thing that is ylle / and not to be curyouse for to do / nor here
after new things / not to rauysshe with his hands / but help largely after
his power / not to be proud of heart / not to think upon evil things / and
not to fylle his belly to much. But do all things by good dyscrecyon. And
these ben then the condycions that a good monk ought to have.

An other holy fader said / pray god that he will give the a meke heart and a
weeping for to weep and weyle over thy sins / the which thou must ever have
a fore this eyes without to Judge any other / but be ye subget to all other /
and have none acqueyntau^ce with women / childern nor heretykes. Trust not upon
thy self. Refrain thy tongue and thy belly / and absteyne thy self from wine.
And if any body speak to the of any thing chyde not with hy^ / and if he
says well / say as he says / but and if he says evil / ask him if he wot
well what he says and force not thy self to chyde nor brault with him of
such things that he has said / and then shall thy thought be peasyble.

Here follows a another little treatise which techeth to find the rest of
conscience. And begins in Latin. Dixit abbas Anthonius.


THe abbot Anthonye said / that like as the fysshes deye anon when they be
taken out of the water which is their own nourysshyng / and are put in a
dry place. In likewise the Relygyouses / when they be out of their celles and
dwelling places or when they dwell with seculer folk / they be lightly
delivered and withdrawn from the rest spyrytuell wiche they ought to have and
keep. Then it is of necessyte that the Relygyouses run again to their
solytarye places / as the fysshes to the sea / to the end that because of their
long being there out / they put not in forgetyng the keeping that they ought
to have of their souls. and Morouer he said / that he that keeps himself
enclosed with scylence and that rests thereat / he is preserved from three
bataylles and great inco^uenyences. First from evil to here. Secondely from
evil to speak. Thyrdely from the syghte of any thing that be noyfull / and
has not but one bataylle to abide / that is to wit / against his heart
denyenge and going against his wicked cogytaco^ns. The abbot Arsenye dwelling
yet in the paleys of the Emperor and before yt he was Relygyouse / besought
right humbly and hertly to god. that he would set him to the way of
salvation. The which prayer made / our lord consyderyng the great and fervent
devotion that he had to live solytaryly / made to be showed unto hy^ by a voice
/ yt he should go away and fle the company of men and in this doing he should
be saved / the same Arsenye leuyng the world / and taking the way solytary
and Relygyouse made again to god such a prayer as the first saying. My god
please the to set me in to ye way of salvation. So herd he a voice yt said.
Arseny flee away / keep thy peace and rest thy self / and in this doing yt
shall take away the Rotys of sin.

The archebysshop Theophyle that was a man of holy and comendable life one time
acompanyed of a Judge of a cite / went toward the abbot Arsenye / and asked him
certain questyons / to the which he answered not. And after that he had kept
himself a little from speaking / he demanded of the Judge and ye archebysshoh
foresaid / if he told to them any thing / whether they should keep it / whereat
they answered ye. Then he said unto them. In all places where ye shall know
yt Arsenye is / keep your self yt ye come not there. An other time the
archebysshop desyryng to see him / sent first to wit of the said holy fader /
if he would open to him the door of his celle. And he sent him word again. If
you will come I shall open to the my door / but and I open it to the / so shall
I do the same wise to all other and then I shall keep me here no longer /
but I shall goo my ways to some other part for to live there solytaryly The
archebysshop heryng these words answered unto the messager. Sith that by my
going toward Arsenye I should trouble him or traueylle him. I am purposed
never to go there.

An other time the said holy fader Arsenye went for to vysyte some relygyouses
dwelling in a place where read grew full thycke which was suddenly moeued by
Impetuosyte of wind. The which thing seeing this holy fader / axed the said
Relygyouses where of came that sodeyne noise. They answered that it was the
wind yt beted against ye said read. And he said to them again. Certainly if a
man sets with rest / and yt he hereth the voice of a bird / he shall not
have in his heart ye rest yt he had before. And how may you then have hope
upon tranquylyte and rest in heryng the noise of ye read / as he would have
said / that a man yt desires for to do the salvation of his soul / can not be
to much withdrawn and parted from the charges and business of the world /
which are to him of more lettyng / the more yt he delyteth him to live
solytaryly. Men find yt his cellle was departed and far from all habytaco^ns
of folk.xxxij. mile or there about / and went not out often / but he had
folk that admynystred unto him his necessytees. And some holy fader said
sometime yt the land of Sychye was destroyed yt no body dwelled there / the
said holy fader said these words. The world has lost Rome / and ye
Relygyouses Sychye. The said abbot making a while his abydyng in a place
called Canap / a holy matrone an old virgyne born of Rome the cite which was
much rich / and dredyng god / desiring hertely to see the said holy fader
Arsenyen / and came in to Alexandrye toward the archebysshop Theophyle / and
besought him that he would be the mean toward the said holy fader / that his
pleasyr were to grant that she should see him. And the said Theophyle seeing
the great affection of the said Matrone went toward the said holy fader
Arsenyen / and made unto him the said Request / to the which he would not
consent. So came Theophyle again and made his report to the matrone / which
not content therwithall / made all things ready for her self to goo there
saying. I believe and have this steadfast trust in god / that he shall suffer me
to see him / for all be it that in our cite of Rome be many holy men that may
comfort me / nevertheless for his great fame. I have purposed for to under
take this vyage to the end that I may see him. So labored she so much by her
Iourneyes / that she came to the place where he dwelled And it happed as our
lord would suffer it / yt for to have by her leyser to see the said holy fader
/ she found him walkyng without his celle. She then laid herself
Inco^tynent to his fete / but nevertheless he took her up again anon by great
dyspyte / and beholding upon her ^yerlly he said unto her. Now if you wylt see
me in ye face behold me then enough here I am. She heryng his rygorouse
words / was so sore ashamed / that she wist not what she should answer and
namely she was not too bold that she durst look him in his vysage. And to her
said again Arsenyen / My ymagynacyon is that sith that ye would see me / you
haste herd speak of my works what neded the for to undertake so great away
for to see me / ye which yt have herd say of me might have suffysed the
Know not ye well that you art a woman / and that it apperteyneth not to thyn
astate that ye sholdest go from thy place for to go in a strange place. I
believe that thou art come hither to the end that ye may to tell to the women
of Rome Incontynente as yt shall come there again / that you have seen me / to
thentente that by the mean the way be found in the sea for to make the women
to come toward me Then she said unto him. I promise the holy fader / that if
it please god yt I may return to Rome again. I shall not tell that I have been
here / nor I shall not be the cause that any body shall come to yt / but I
pray the that it will please the for to pray for me / and with this to have
always remembrance of me. Whereat he answered I pray god that he will put the
soon out of my thought. She heryng these things went away from him all
wroth and sorry. And Incontinent that she was come again to Alexandrye the cite
because of the great sorrow and heaviness that she had / a sykenesse took her
with a sharp fyuer. The which thing was told unto ye holy archebysshop
Theophyle. So came he toward her for to comfort her. And he asking what she
eyled / she answered to him. Alas my lord would god that I had not come here.
At my departing from that holy fader I prayed him that he would woushesauf to
have me in mind. And he has answered me / that he prayed god / that he would
take away from him the Remembrance of me. The which answer has angered and
troubled me so sore that I am in danger for to deye Then said to her
Theophyle / know not yt that ye art a woman / and that by woman the devil
tempts the holy men. For this cause the holy man has given the this answer.
But nevertheless you ought not think but that he will pray god besyly for thy
soul. The good Matrone then heryng these words ceased anon her wrath /
and in great Joy and gladness returned again to the cite of Rome.

The abbot Euagrius said that he that will keep him that he shall not fall in
trybulaco^n / and to keep his ghost with rest / ought naught to have diverse
affecco^ns toward many folk.

A brother came in to Sychye toward the abbot Moses / to whom vysytyng him he
required hy^ that he would tell him some good word edyfycatyue for to bear it
in his mind to the end that he should have remembrance of him. So answered
unto him Moses / that he should go and keep hy^ within his celle / and it
should learn him all things that be good. The said Moses said / that the man
that flees the company of men / is like a grape of Reysyns ripe and sweet /
but he that seeks their felysshyp and acompanyeth with them / is like unto ye
grape that is sour and bitter.

The abbot Nyle said that the man that loves to live solytaryly / yeldeth
himself so steadfast to deny and withstand against ye arowes / that is to wit
against the temptacyons of the fend / that they should not touch nor enter in
him / but he that hauntyth and comynyth with the men is oftentimes dau^gerously
wounded.

The abbot pastor said / yt to apply his thought unto diverse things / is the
beginning of all euylles / and more over he said / that to flee from the
temporal things was a good and a sure live. Certainly when a man dress him
self nyghe a place where men fight bodily / he is like him which is upon a
deep water / to the end that at such an hour as his adversary shall seem good
he may take him and make him for to fall unto the botom. But and if he
partyth him self and gooth far from the bodily things / he is like him that
is far from the well / and when the fend will cast him from above to
benethe / for to do this he will draw him vyolently nyghe to the said well /
god preserved him therfrom and gives him socours and aid.

The abbot Sysoyns had a dyscyple ye said ones unto hy^. Fair fader that you
art already old / and yt you have dyscreco^n and wit for to withsaye against ye
temptaco^ns of ye world / me seems yt you might well hau^te a sytyll through ye
world / to whom the holy fader answered / yt he would well do so / if he could
bring hy^ in a place where no women were. The dyscyple hyryng this answer
said unto hy^ again / yt he wist of no place but ye women were there / but only
in ye solytary places. Now led me there then said the holy fader.

An old matrone which was an abbess said yt many Relygyouses being in ye
montayn / yt is to wit in solytary places / are perysshed there / because that
they had set their thought and affecco^ns unto thyngis of ye world / and yt it
is better for to be among many one and to lead there wylfully a solytary life
/ than for to be above and apply his thought to multyplycaco^n of temporal
things.

An old holy fader said / that a monk ought ever to bye rest in such manner
yt he dyspyseth it if he see ye any bodily hurt comes to hy^ thereby.

An aeged holy fader showed yt three great clerks much studyouse gave the^
self to Relygyon / one of which chose and took in hy^self this affecco^n yt
he would pease and bring all persons at one which he might know ye ought
evil will one to an other or yt had any matter of plee or debate ye one against
the other. The second thought / yt he would vysyte ye bedred and ye syke. And
ye third went and enhabyted hy^self in a solytary place. The first then
besyeng hy^self in his entrepryse / found so many noyses and dyfferences /
debates and questyons to be moeued among ye men yt it should not have been
possible to him for to pease all. Wherefore he fulfilled with noyaunce and gryse
with it / because he could not satysfye his deliberaco^n / ^am for to see ye
second / the which also he found sore weary and noyouse / yt he might not
serve all the syke folk and the poor nedy for ye great multitude yt he found
of them every where. So these two purposed for to go see ye third which was
gone for to live solytaryly in ye desert. And when they were come toward hy^
after yt they had made knowledge of broderhode unto each other / the tweyne
reherced unto ye third their great trybulaco^ns prayeng hy^ yt he would
declare unto them what thing be did and how he profyted in his hermytage. To
the which oues^yon he did not answer redely. But after yt he had keep
hy^self still a little / he took water in a vessel and said to them / behold
a little this water that is trouble. And they began to look upon / and whyse
they looked so / the water began to wexe clear by it self. Then said he unto
them when he saw yt it was fair and clean / look how suddenly this water is
puryfyed by it self. Then they beholden within it they knew their own
vysages therein as it had be in a glass. Then he told them that in likewise
he yt acompanyed among ye world with great pain he may know there his own
fawtes because of the great troubles that be in the world / but when he
withdraws himself in to a solytarye place / than may he know lightly his
sins.

Here follows the treatise techynge how men ought to styre them to compunccyon
/ and begins in latin. Dicebant de abbate Arsenio.


THe abbot Arsenye / as some told / all the time of his live syttyng and
abydyng within his celle / labouryng and werkyng with his hands / had ever in
his bosom a hand keuerchyef for to wype withal the teeres that contynuelly
ran out of his eyes / in sorowyng for his sins and for dread of god and of
the pains of hell which he had ever in his mind.

A brother Required the abbot Ammon that he would tell hy^ some good word
helthfull / to whom he answered. Go to thy celle and think upon thy befalle /
as the evil doers do / that for their misdeeds be kept in prison. then
questyoned they yt come toward them askyng where the Judge is / and when he
shall come / and waytyng after ye gryuouse punycyon of their sins they weep
and weyle over them. In likewise ye Relygyouse ought ever to be supecte / and
^hyde within his soul / saying. Ha me wretched / how shall I dare find me
before the great Judgment of our lord Ihesu christ for to yield him accomptes
and reason of my deffautes. And if thou thynkest in thy self so / you shall may
be saved through this mean.

The abbot Euagrius said / when you art within thy celle gadre thy spyrytes
within thy self and remember the of the day of death / and then you shall
see the mortyfycaco^n of thy body. Think also upon the mortal werres of this
world / and be sorrowful for it. Have in hatred the vanytees of this world /
be temperate and curyouse / to the end you may ever dwell in one manner rest /
and be not syke of the sykenesse of sin. Remember the of them that be in
hell / and think in thy self how their souls ben in that place / in what
bitter heaviness / in what horrible weylyng / in what dread in what battle /
and in what waiting of sorrow / and yt without withdrawyng of pains they be
in Infynyte teeres. Be you also Remembryng of the last resurrecco^n / and
ymagyne the horrible Ingement of god with the wonderful co^fusyon that the
sinners shall suffer in the presence of god the fader / and of Ihesu christ his
sone / and before the angels / archangels and postles / and before all ye men of
the world / with this consydere the tourmentes and the fire everlasting where
they shall be condemned / ye remors Inmortall of their conscyences / the
derkenesse of hell / and above all thing the gryndyng of tethe / the pains
and ye torments yt be there. After consider and bring in to the mind ye
wealth and felycytees yt be promised unto the Just / the trust that they shall
have in god the fader and his sone before the angels / archangels and
potestates / and before the company of all the heavenly court. And in lywyse
the gifts of grace / the Joys and ye rest wherein they shall be / the
recordaco^n and remembrance of the which things / yt is to wit the euyls
at do side / and the gods at the other side / you must have in thy self
weeping bytterly.

The abbot Helye said yt in all seasons he fered three things yt ben to come /
the first was ye hour of death / the second when his soul should be
presents before god for to be Iuged / and the.iij. what the sentence should be
yt should be cast upon him. And therefore the good archebysshop Theophyle when
he was at ye point of death he said of saint Arseny / that he was well happy
in so much yt he contynuelly had this hour before ye eyes of his entendement.

The abbot James said / yt like as the lantern lyghtneth ye place which is
obscure and derke. In likewise ye dread of god lyghteneth a man when he has it
within him.

Some brethern asked of the abbot Machary how he could be so dry and of so
poor of body / whereat he answered yt when men take a staff in their hand
and with it they rake and styre the brondes yt be a fire the same staff
barneth and consumes away fynably. In like wise who soever shall have in him
the dread of god it shall consume ye flesh of a man away unto the bones.

The holy faders dwelling in the mo^tayn of Nitrye sent toward the abbot
Machary yt was in Sychye prayng hy^ yt he would come to see them / and if he
came not to them / they were purposed for to go to him / because yt they
desired for to see by before his death. And when he was come to the montayn
where they dwelled / they togydre asked him some consolaco^n spyrytuall. Then
he said unto them yt they should weep and weyle over their sins / to the end
yt they should not def^ende in to hell where men weep and weyle euerlastyngly.
And they all togydre at ones began to weep and besought by yt he would pray god
for them The abbot Pastor gooyng through Egstpt law a woman upon a grave / the
which bette herself and wept so sore yt it seemed if all the Joys of the
world had come to her yt she should not rejoice herself for it. So in likewise
ought to do ever a Relygyouse in this world. An other time he passed through
the parties of Dyolche with the abbot Nub / and they found a woman yt wept
bytterly for the death of her husband / of her sone and of her brother. Then
said the abbot Pastor to ye abbot Nub I belyue steadfastly yt no man but if he
slay all concupyscence of ye flesh / and but he have as great contryco^n as
this woman / he is not worthy to be a Relygyouse. And this he said because yt
all her thought was set upon weeping. And thus we ought to do for our sins.
A brother axed sometime ye said Pastor some good conseyll for his saluaco^n And
he conscylled hy^ yt he should do as Abraham did when he entered in the land
of promysson / the which made a tomb / which sygnyfyed wepynges and
sorowynge.

The archeb^sshop Athanasy prayed ones the abbot Pambo yt he should come do^ne
from his hermytage for to see hy^ in the cite of Alexandrye. The which coming
do^ne to it met with a common woman / and when he saw her he began to weep.
Athanasy asked him what moeued hy^ to do so / whereat he answered ye two things
moeued it. The first because he saw that the woman dampened herself the second
because he took not somoche of pain to please god as she did for to please the
world. The abbot Syluayn being ones with his Relygyouses / was rauysshed
gostly / so yt he fell do^ne yt face to ye earth and after yt he had be there a
long while he rose up again weeping full sore. So axed hy^ his relygyouses what
hy^ eyled fo: to weep thus / but he answered them nothy^g / and ever he wept /
they nevertheless prayed hy^ somoche that they constrained hy^ by humble
Requests to tell them yt ye they desired to wit of hy^ / and in effect he
showed unto them / yt he had be rauysshed and born before god holdyng his
Judgment / where he saw many relygyouses yt were conde^pned to ye everlasting
pain of hell / and many seculer men yt were taken and received for to go to
ye royalme of heaven / whereof ye poor abbot wept ever bytterly / and for this
cause he becam so solytary / yt he would not go out of his celle / and if he
was sometime constrained to go out of it / he covered his head with a hode /
saying yt it was no need for to see this light temporal where no goodness was.

A man worthy of holy memory named Synclyeyce / said yt they ye turn themself
from sin unto virtue / have great pain at begynny^g to leave their evil
life / but at ye last they shall have Joy unable to be told / even so as they
ye kyndlen a fire have at beginning great akyng of head with blowyng / and at
their eyes with ye smoke or ever ye fire be kyndled. Also we must have many
euylles for to kyndle within us the fire of the love of god.

The abbot Ypericius said yt a monk ought to watch day and night in oryson /
in waylyng and in co^puncco^n / to the end that through this mean he have the
mercy of Ihesu christ.

Many Relygyouses seculers came together to ye abbot Felix / and be diverse times
prayed hy^ yt he would give the^ some good doctrine for their saluaco^n / but
nevertheless he would not / but only said unto the^ / now have I no tongue for to
spek. The brethern heryng this answer were sore abashed because he would not
teache them. Then he said to the^ / sometime yt Relygyouses required for to be
taught of ye aeged / and they did yt ye was commanded unto the^ / wherefore our
lord gaaf to ye said old faders tongue and speech for to learn them / and
because yt ye dyscyples now do no more nothing of yt is commanded unto them /
god has taken from ye aeged yt word of very doctrine / for there is no more
no body yt does this yt ye old faders command. These words herd they all
together began to weep and syghe askyng mercy / and yt the said abbot would
pray for them.

A holy fader said when our lord shall come to yt day of dome / if it were
possible yt ye souls yt then shall be brought to their bodies / might be
departed again all yt world should then deye of ye dread and terror ye every
one shall have at you said day / therefore we ought well to weep in this world
and do penance to the end yt at ye same ferfull day we may yield good acomptes
unto our lord.

A brother axed a holy fader whereof came yt he was hard herted and yt he fered
not god. The holy fader answered to hy^ yt he should have dread of god / if he
would rebuke his soul saying. My soul think upon thy life / for you shall be
brought before the might of god for to be Iuged to be dampened perpetuelly or
saved euerlastyngly.

An other holy fader seeing a man yt loughe said to hy^. My friend I meruayll
me how you dare laugh as you doste seen yt before god our maker yt day that we
shall deye we shall have to answer straytly of all our works / and if you were
well aduysed forgety^g to laughe / thou sholdest consydere / that thus as she
shadow follows the body in what place that he is / also in what place yt we
be we ought to have a bitter co^punccyon of heart / and weep contynuelly over
our sins.

A brother axed an holy fader some holsom word. And he cold him / that when
Egypt was punysshe of the hand of god / there was no house but every body wept
that was in.

An other axed a like questyon / that is to wit what thing he ought to do for
to be saved / whereat the holy fader answered unto him / that he should weep
without ceassyng / for our lord will that our souls be tormented and scorged
by contrycyons and waylynges / and at the last we shall have that we ask of
him. And this witnesses the psalm that says in the psalter / that the heart
contryte and humylyed / shall never be dyspraysed of him. Of that other part
he says in the gospel. Thoo be blessed yt weep in this world / for they
shall be comforted euerlastyngly.

Here fynyssheth the treatise of compunccyon.
An other treatise follows consequently of contynence and ^ohrenes against
glotony and other vices. And begy^neth in latin Fratres aliqui etc.

MAny brethern of Sychye purposed ones that they should go vysyte Saint
Anthonye. And thus as they came to an hauon for to sail thither / they entered
in to a shypp with an holy fader which they knew not They being upon the
water spak of holy scryptures and of the life of faders also in likewise of
their works. And all this herkned the holy fader and said no word. when they
were londed saint Anthonye said to these foresaid brethern. Ha my fre^des ye
are come hither with a holy man and a devout. After he said to the holy fader
/ and you also art come hither with good Relygyouses / and by all thus he praised
both yt one part and also the other. The holy fader yt had not spoken said
unto saint Anthonye / yt they were good truly / but their house had no gate /
and who soever entered in it / be might rob the ass or the horse / that was
for to say / that all that came in their mind they vttred and spoke it
without to have any contynence in their words.

The abbot Danyell said to the abbot Arsenye that he slepte never but a little
toward the morning for to socour nature / and when sleep came upon him / he
said. O evil servant / yt nourysshed the man all oonly with vices / why
come you when I call not the. And anon after all syttyng he took a little
rest and incontinent he rose again. This Arsenyen said that a monk if he be a
very champyon for to befyght his enmye / ought not to sleep but an hour of
the day. The abbot Danyell certyfyeth again of the said Arseny / that a little
mete which men gave hy^m suffysed him for a hole year. And yet at the end of
the year when the brethern vysyted hy^ they ete of it with hy^. This Arseny for
to correct hy^self and bear penance of the odours flagrau^t and sweet of
smell whereof he had used in the paleys of the emperor before yt he was Relygyouse
/ ones in ye year oonly he changed the water of his vessel wherein he weted
his wekker and rods for to make withal panyers mau^des and baskettes / and
endured the stenche and the infeccyon of the said water instead of ye said
good odours yt he had smelled before. The abbot Agathon bare within his mouth
the space of three year a stone to thentent that he might acustome hy^self to
keep silence. The said Agathon ones walkyng found a bou^dell of fetches with
their hulles / yt which bou^dell one of his Relygyouses that was wyllyng for
to take and bear it with him ared the said Agathon if he should do so. And the
abbot seeing this / axed hy^ if he had set it there / the monk answered not.
Then said to him Agathon / why will thou bear away that that is not thyn /
and that thou have not brought there as thou will take it. The abbot Achylles
bled ones at his mouth / a monk that saw this / axed him whereof that came.
So answered to him the said Achylles / that the word of a brother had angered
hy^ / and yt for to withstand against his wrath he had prayed god that he would
take away from him the remembrance of the said wrongs / to the end they
should not abide in his thought / wherefore our lord had turned them in to
blood and as he casted and spued he was hole of his heaviness.

The abbot Amoys being syke many brethern sent unto him diverse metes / but
because he should not ete of the^ he shette his eyes when his dyscyple entered
in to his chamber beryng the said metes.

The abbot Benyamyn told of many brethern the which went for to vysyte a holy
fader in Sychye / and bare hy^ a little oil. To whom he said that already ye
space of three year was passed / that theymselfe had brought hy^ some in a
vessel / the which was yet full and in yt astate as they had brought it unto
hy^ / and had not touched it syn. So wondered they much of his contynence / and
how he had kept ye said oil so long. Some brethern reherced of the abbot
Dyoscore that he used for his etynge but bread of barley / and every year
constrained himself to keep a strong rule / as thrughe a hole year he would
not see no body. An other year he would not speak to no body / or he wolde^
not cast of oo mete soden roast or baken / or such like abstynences he made.

The abbot Euagrius said yt who would withsta^de against wrath / all flesshely
desires must be first cast and taken away the which thing he did.

Epyphanius bishop of Cypre when he should deye he sent toward the abbot
Hylaryon for to pray him that he should come speak with hy^ / for he desired
for to see hy^ or ever he should deye. And after yt he was come to him theyer
togydre. The bishop made a bird to be presented before the said saint Hylaryon
for his mete / the which answered to the said bishop yt syn he had taken the
habyte of a monk he had not eten no mete yt for his fode should have received
death. And the bishop said to hy^ again / that syn yt he had taken the
bysshopryche in his hand / if any person had hate or questyon with hy^ / he
had never suffered his enmye to s^ep in that astate / but should first have
peased him. Also he never slept till that he had reconcylyed him self with his
enmye. Then saint Hylaryon said to him that his conuersacon was worthy of
greter praysyng than his own. Some said of saint Paladyon yt he was.^^. year
in his celle without his eyes to cast up so yt during the said.^^ year / he
saw never the ^ouffe nor the coueryng of his celle.

The abbot Zenon as he walked through the contree of Palestyne found hy self
nyghe a place where some gordes grew and because that he was sore hongry he
wyllyng to content his appetyt would ete some of them nevertheless because
him thought if he ete of them that he should do theft he would preue first if
he might suffer ye tormente that was ordained for theuys. He took of his
clothes and all naked he abode there in the hete of the son by the space of
five days / which was the punycyon yt men did unto the theuys And when he
saw yt he could not endure the said hete / he said to himself Sith that I can
not endure the pain that I should suffer if I were apeched of this theeft. It
is better yt I fast than that I should do this deed.

Johan the less said / yt when a king or a prince will take a cite by force
and bring in to his subgeccyon his adversaries yt be within / he find the
means for to dystourne their waters for to let that they shall have no
vytaylles / and by this mean they be compelled for to do as his will is. And
thus it is of relygyouses / when they restrain mete from their bodies / they
be not so subgett unto the temptaco^ns of ye flesh which be enmyes of the
soul / but they make them subgete unto the soul reasonable. And if a man by
fasting is turned to virtue / the deuyls ye enforce themself for to bring hy^
under fore shall be subgett unto him / and not he to them. He said again that ones
going in Sychye where he was gone for to cut rods and leaves to occupye
himself therwithall he found a heerde or keeper of Camels the which would have
troubled him but for to eschew that he should have no debate with him / he
cast done his bou^dell and left it behind him and so flee away.

The abbot Ysaac said yt he knew well a relygyouse / the which helpyng to
repe corn / ared unto hy^ for whom he wrought / if he should dare take oo
corn of it for to ete / the which y merueylled of the fere and of the
dau^grour that he made to take of it answered to him / yt he gave hy^ not oonly
one corn of it / but all the hole field.

A brother axed to the abbot Ysodore how it might be yt the deuyls drad hy^ so
sore / whereat he answered / that syn the time he was first yolden in to
Relygyon / he ever kept him self that he fell not in wrath / and if oo
sparkell of sin was kyndled within hy^ / he did put it out incontinent / and
by this mean the deuyls had no might over him And morouer he said / that he
being at his.xl. year of age and more / he had never consent to do sin /
nor he had not be overcome of any coueytynge of the sin of wrath.

The abbot Cassanius wytnessed ^ on a day he went to vysyte the abbot Johan
which by the space of.xl. year had dwelled on ye highest of a montayne with
the abbot Esyon which ye said abbot Johan loved with a love much charytable.
So questyoned he him by the charity that he had unto the said Esyon / sayng
unto him / where he by so long time had lived with out to haunte among the
world / and without to have be greuyd or troubled of our person / what he had
done during that time for the salvation of his soul / whereat he answered that
during the said.xl. year / he ete never till the son was gone under / nor he
had never he on angered during ye time. The abbot Moses told of a Relygyouse
named Serapyon which held him self with the abbot Theon. This Serarapyon
after that he had taken his refeccyon in common he took always of a custom a
ferdynge loffe and ete it secretly in the absence of his abbot / and was so
customed withal that he could not keep him self therfro / but that after his
repast he ete ever the said loffe in a secret place. It happed by the will of
god that some Relygyouses came to vysyte his abbot / which exhorted them all
to have in them the virtue of abstynence / and of sobryete / saying with this
to them / that the deuyls had no thing so aggreable / than to make a sinner
that he shall not show nor tell his sin by confession to his goostly fader.
For through this mean / the shryfte of him that so keeps his sin within him
still prouffyteth him not in no manner of wise.

The said Serapyon heryng these words he ymangyned that god had done his sin
to be known unto his abbot. So he soon after shroue him self unto his abbot
which to hy^ said O my sone thou art now out of thraldom / wit it that the
deuyls had the in their possessyon / but by thy confession they are chassed
from the / and thou art no more under their might.

And as the abbot said unto him these words / there lept out of the said
Serapyons bosom a brounde of fire that Infected and poisoned all the chamber /
so that all the place stanke after brymstone. The which thing seeing the
abbot foresaid / how be it that he was of it sore merueylled said with a merry
contenaunce unto the said Serapyon. O my dear friend / thou see now by
effect / how god through his great power has delivered the in showing of them
that thy sin is forgyuen of his godly godenesse.

The abbot Machary when he was with his brethern / sometime for to please them
he drank wyn with them / but nevertheless he bare afterward a great penance
for it / for as many times as he had dronk of it / asmany days after he
absteyned hy^self from all manner of lycour were it water or other drink what
soever it was.

The abbot Machary yt called was the great in Sychye / after that the service
was done in the church / he said unto his Relygyouses yt they should flee and
some of them axed him where they should flee / and if they should leave their
monasterye. Then he put his finger before his mouth / and said. My brethern
I do show you this yt ye ought to flee / and by this token they knew that he
showed them to keep silence without to speak the one to ye other / at lest of
thing that were vain.

The abbot Pastor said. If Nabuzardam prince of glotony had not be / the Temple
of god had not be burnt. Also if the man be not burnt by abstynence from mete
and drink / the soul shall not withstand against the devil. Some reherced of
the said abbot Pastor / yt when he was desired of his brethern for to ete with
them where as he had no will to it he constrained him self to the same / and
thither he went weeping not for to ete / but for to show himself toward them
obeyssau^t / and that he should not give to them matter or occasyon yt they
should be^ wroth with him Some also to the said abbot Pastor told of a monk
yt drank no wine / and he said unto them again / ye a Relygyouse ought not to
drink any drink. Item he said yt like by the smoke men constraynen the bees
to leave and forsake their honny for to take it and bear away / also repleccyon
of belly and glotony chasseth and puts aback the dread of god from the soul.

The abbot Peter otherwise called Payen / he being taken with some syknesse /
would never drynk no wyn / but for all substance he drank luke water. Many
brothern being upon a day in ye montayn where ye abbot Anthony held hy^ self
/ after yt ye masses were song / they found a vessel full of wyn. One of ye
elders took then a little chalyce / and presented twyes of ye said wyn for to
drink unto ye abbot Sysoy / which took it and at ye.iij. time he said to hy^
ye presented it to hy^ / brother rest thyself / you know not if ye devil be
in it or no. A brother axed of ye said Sysoy counsel because ye often when he
went to ye chirch his bredere^ by charity withhelde hy^ for to ete with them /
whereat he answered yt it was a thing ouermoche dau^gerouse and peryllouse for
ye soul. Abraham which dyscyple was to ye said Sysoy / axed hy^ if he drank
wyn three times upon ye sunday / whether yt was to much or no / he answered
nay / if that sin followed not thereby.

The abbot Syluayn and Zachary his dyscyple walkyng on a day came to a
monastery and there they took their repast / and after took their way again
Zachary by the way was a thurst and would drynk water / his abbot said unto
hy^. My son it is fasting day what will thou do. The dyscyple answered. Fader we
have ete. The abbot said. Ha my child / that was a refeccyon of charity with
our brethern / but nevertheless we must keep our fast.

Saint Syncletyce said / that he is not parfytly chaste that laugheth and
beheldeth dysordynatly notwithstanding yt he does not actuelly or in deed the
sin of ye flesh. Item he said that as the oynementes chassen away the
bestes venymouses and the venym / in likewise fasting and oryson chassen fro
man foul and wicked thoughts. Item he said yt Rich folk ought not for their
rychesses to take cure nehede to ete diverse metes dressed with diverse sawses.
For they should be cause to make them fall in to many sins / but must pass
therouer as he that roweth over the water.

The abbot Syson said / sith that we be pilgrims in this worla^ / let us keep
our mouth from many words. Ypericius said yt the monk ought to be as rebelle
against the temptaco^ns / as the lion against the asses. Item fasting is to a
monk ye brydell against sin / for he that fasteth not / but pleases his
desires as an horse brydelesse / is lightly and for little thing taken with a
dysordynate love of wymmen. Item fasting renders the body of a Relygyouse
lene and dry / and arayseth his soul on high / and brings to naught his
vain thoughts and delectacyons. Item a man chaste here in earth shall be of god
worshypped and crowned in heaven. Item he that can not keep his tongue in time of
wrath / may not be master over his passyo^s of his body against the temptour.
Item the mouth ought never to speak foul or evil word / because that the
vine bears no thorns. Again he said that better it is to a monk for to ete
flesh and drink wine / than to ete his brother by bakbytyng.

Sometime in Sychye was a fest made where some wine was brought unto an holy
fader which said to him yt brought it. Brother take away that death from before
me / as he would have said / that wine excessyuely taken is death to a man.

A Relygyouse priest in Sychye went ones to speak with ye bishop of
Alexandrye / and when he was comen again his brethern axed him what it was of
the Cite / whereat he answered / that feryng to see there any thing that should
moeue him to sin / he had so refrayned the sight of his eyes / that he had
not seen there none other man but the bishop / and after the other brother
at his exemple kept their eyes from lokyng a high.

A relygyouse went ones to see a brother of his Relygyon which at his comy^g
made his dyscyple make ready a few herbs for to feste ye brother yt was come /
and having ye time yt their refecco^n was a making ready / they went together in
to ye oratory / and there they were unto ye morrow at ye hour of sexte
deuysyng of spyrytuell things / and then came and said again to his dyscyple
yt he should make ready their repast / the which dyscyple said unto him yt it
was made all ready sit the day before.

Two other brethern being togydre waytyng after their wortes were made ready for
their mete / the one said to the other / that they should set them to pray
god before that they should take their repast / so took the one of them upon
him for to read the psalter / and that other two books of the prophecyes and
the next day they had no mind at all to their mete / but had forgete that
they should ete / and so went they away from each other.

A brother having honger from that hour that he rose out of his bed found him
self constrained for to ete / but he against his will constrained hy^ self to
fast unto the hour of tyerce / and fro tyerce till se^te. Then he set him
for to ete / and incontinent stood up again and said that he should fast unto
none / at which hour he made his prayer unto god / and co^tynuyng the same
he saw the devil yt went a way from hy^ like a smoke whereby he knew yt by
ye same devil he had be tempted for to ete.

A holy fader being syke so yt he could not ete was constrained by his dyscyple
for to ete a little m^^cion made of oil honny and meele. And in the dressyng
of it he poored in it said oil all stynkyng wenyng to hy^ to have poored in
some honny / and be gaaf to his master thereof for to ete / which holy fader
knowing yt his dyscyple had not done it by malice ete of it three days for to
give to his body more pain and sharpness. An other holy fader because he
desired to much affectuelly for to have eten of a concombre for to correct
and punysshe his dysordynat aptyt / he did hage one in his celle / to the end
yt lokyng upon it and not etyng of it he should bear penance upon him of the
lust and desire that he had taken thereupon.

An other Relygyouse having a sister in a relygyon / was showed that she was
sore syke. So came he to her monasterye to thentent that he should vysyte and
see her / but she that was constante in faith and right holy / and that syn she
was betaken to Relygyon was not wont to see any men / would not give unto her
brother none occasyon to come under her shadow for to como^ne among women of
Relygyon / wherefore she let him wit that she would another see him nor speak
with hy^ / and that he should return to his own monastery again and yt he
would pray god for her / to the end ye helpyng ye grace of god she might see
him in the Royalme of heaven.

A monk walkyng by ye way met sometime an abbess acompanyed with some
Relygyouse wy^men which this monk made great force to look upon them for to
know what they were and of what monastery / and for this cause left his way
and took theyrs. To whom the abbess said / that if he had be a parfyte
Relygyouse he should not have put him in pain for to look upon them somoche
that he should have knowing that they had be women / as she would have said /
that in going on his way / he ought to open so soberly his eyes yt he should
not see nor apperceyue thoos that came against him or that passed their ways by
him.

An holy man which was Archebysshop of the Cite of Alexandrye / and had to
name Theophyle required some holy faders Relygyouses / yt they should come toward
hy^ in ye said cite of Alexa^drye / trustyng that by their prayers and merytes
he should dystroye some temples where were done many ydolatryes within the said
cite and in the contree about it. These holy faders ones among other etyng with
the said archebysshop were served with veell where of they ete not taking head
to their mete. The archebysshop which desired to make them good there took a
capon that was in his dysshe before hy^ and set it before one of the said holy
faders / saying that it was good and that he should ete of it. The holy fader
answered unto him. Certaynely I have wend to this hour that I had eten
coals / but syn I perceive that it is flesh I shall no more ete of it. After
the which words said the other Relygyouses left their etynge of such
flesh that was brought before them.

An other Relygyouse desired some for to ete of his little loves of new bread
that he had baken him self under the asshys. And when they had ete each of
them one of this small loves / they left their etyng. The brother that had
boden them thereunto seeing the pacyence of their abstynence / and that they
should well have eten yet more of them / prayed them in the name of god yt they
would yet ete some / till that they had their fylle of them. So began they again
for to ete of the said loves of bread to the nombre of ten every man / which
thing they did as veraye Relygyouses / not for no necessyte that they had of
it / but pryncypally for to obey unto the request of the said Relygyouse that
thereto had desired them in the name of our lord god.

An other holy fader was sometime syke of a gryuouse sykenesse which was such
/ that out of his entraylles he casted blood by great plente. And for to
socoure him at his need a Relygyouse brought him some almau^des / whereof he
made him a cawdell which he presented unto the good holy fader saying. Fair
fader I pray the that thou will ete this / for I hope that it is good for to
Restowre the thy health. And after that the holy fader had looked upon him a
long while / he said to him. Certainly my brother I did desire that god should
hold me.xxx. year in this sykenesse / and for this cause he would not obey to
the Request of the said Relygyouse / another ete of ye candell ye he had brought
to him / and was constrained to bear it again with him and to Return in to his
celle.

An ancient fader hauy^g his celle far within the deserts / and departed
from all folk / was vysyted of a brother which found him sore syke. So he
washed him his face that was all bespoted and wasted for because of his
sykenesse. And after he made ready certain things for him to ete that he had
brought there with him And the good old fader seeing this / he said unto him.
Certaynely my brother. I had forgoten that men had taken any solas or
pleasures in etynge. And after he presented him with a cup of wine for to
drink / which good aeged fader beholdynge the said cup began for to weep
and said / that he hoped not to drink of any wine till that death should take
him.

An other old fader purposed ones in himself that he should not drink during
the space of.xl. days contynuelly. And there as he was in a great necessyte
because of the hete / he did fylle a glass full of water / yt which he henge
up before him within his celle. And when his brethern asked him why he did so
/ he answered he did it to the end yt in seeing the same water within the said
glass / where as he should have a lust and desire to take of it for to stynte
his thrust withal and nevertheless should not cast of it / he might by this
mean receive of our lord more great Reward.

An other brother walkyng by the way with his mother that was already come to a
great aege / found a stre^e through which they must pass / which thing his
mother should not have conne do withstandyng her old aege and feebleness
Wherefore the brother constrained for to have her over / took of his mau^tell
and be wrapped her hands withal / to the end that he should not couche her
naked flesh. And thus he took her up on his neck and bare her over the said
streme. And where his mother asked him why he had be wrapped her hands in his
mantell he answered that he had done it / because that he knew that the body
of a woman is lykened unto fire that all wastes. And for this cause to
thentente he should eschew that in touching her naked flesh the remembrance
of other women should not be brought in his mind / he would thus be wrappe her
hands.

An other aeged holy fader said that he knew a Relygyouse which was wont to
fast all the holy passion weke. And the satyrdaye of the said weke when he came
to the mass with the other Relygyouses he waited till the mass were begone
for to enter within the church. And the mass done / after he had received the
holy sacrament of the altar he departed hastly out of the church / to the
end that he should not be constrained by his brethern for to ete with them /
for he loved better to live solytaryly etynge within his celle alone some
colles or beetes soden in water and salt than for to common with them and ete
other metes.

Many brethern in Sychye were ones called togydre for to gader read and palm /
among which there was one that by fyn force of great abstynences was sore
feeble and syke / and began to coughe and spue castyng out of his mouth some
fleemes / and thus doing he happed to spue unknowing upon one of his brethern
which therefore was moeued in courage to tell him that he should leave his
spuynge upon him / but nevertheless constraynynge him self to withstand
against his sodayn will he took with his hands that that the other had spued
upon him / and ete it and said to him self / tell not to thy brother nothing
that may make him to fall in to heaviness / but rather ete that whereat thou
have horror and abhomynacyon.

Here follows a another treatise against fornycacyon.


THe abbot Anthonye said that he supposed the body of every man to have his
naturell moeuyng togydre spread in him self. The which naturell moeuyng can
not work against the will of yt heart / but oonly it is sygnyfyed in ye body
of man as a moeuyng Impassyble. There is yet an other moeuyng coming of ye fode
of ye body which is Refeccyon of metes and drynkes / by help of which yt
hete of yt blood causes this self blood to work. And to this purpose said
the postle Beware yt ye make not yourselfe drunk of wyn yt moeueth a man to
lechery And our lord again co^mau^dyng to his postles said unto them. Keep you
that your hertes be not greuyd / yt is to say I made heavy by sin through
glotony and dronkenshyp. Morouer the said abbot Anthonye said / that there is
yet do other moeuyng to those that in conuersaco^n fight against vices / the
which moeuyng comes and proceeds of ye watchynges and of ye envy of ye
deuyls. And thus it is to be noted yt we have.iij. moeuynges corporal. One
which is naturell / yt second which comes of repleccion of metes / and ye
third of the subgeccion of the deuyls of hell.

The abbot Geronces otherwise called Petrense said / yt many are tempted of
corporal delectaco^ns / and how be it yt they sin not bodily in asmoche that
they fulfill not effectuelly such delectacions / always they sin in thought
/ as those that keep by constrayte their virgynyte / and in their courage
corrupt the same in so much / that if it were not by some dread seruyll ye
refrayneth them / they should soon be redye for to perform yt dysordynate
aptyt of their courage. And therefore said the said holy fader to his Relygyouses.
My right well-beloved brethern. It is a good thing and profitable to do yt ye
scripture says / yt is to wit / every one to keep his heart by curyouse keeping
/ in castyng from him self by fervent charity all dysceytes and temptacyons of
the devil.

The abbot Cassyan said yt he had herd ye abbot Moses say / yt it was a
thing good and profitable not to hyde or keep clos his thought / namely yt it
was necessary to open and s^ewe them unto ye ancient holy faders spyrytuell y
filled with wysdom and dyscreco^n / and not oonly to thoo yt be called old for
their great age. For many one consyderyng the great age of some faders / and
not taking head if they were wise or dyscrete / have showed unto them their
cogytacyons and thoughts hoping to have thereof some assuagyng / the which
have be deceived / for why / because yt these old faders were not well learned
/ the shewers instead of comfort and consolacyon / are come finally to the
last dyspeyre.

A Relygyouse there was that set all his cure and business to use and live
holyly. And where he was sore tempted of the sin of fornycacyon / he came
unto an old fader to whom he declared his temptacyons. The which heryng this
Relygyouse / and because he was not well expert / was wonderfully moeued
against him / saying to him that he was myschaunt and wretched / and not worthy
for to were the habyte of a Relygyouse / in as much that he received in his
courage such thoughts and teptacyons. The poor brother heryng his words
mystrust him self and left his celle and took on his way for to Return to lead his life among wordly folk. But it happed by the will of god that he was
met of Appollo the abbot which seeing hy^ thus sore troubled and sorrowful
questyoned hy^ sayng My sone I see well that you are troubled in thy courage /
tell me I pray yt what is the cause of thy heaviness so great. The
Relygyouse act the first for the great confusyon that he had taken at his
heart answered him nothing / but after that he had be prayed ones again of the
said holy abbot for to declare unto him his befall. He showed it unto him
saying. Alas my lord it is truth / that I have found my self sore tempted
and troubled of the sin of fornycacyon / whereof I have dyscouered me unto
such an holy fader / hoping that he should have give me so^ goo^ remedy to
the easyng of my conscience / but his words have put me from all hope of
salvation / wherefore all dysperate I return to dwell in the world among ye
seculer folk. Then the good fader Appollo heryng his words called him / and
as a good goostly fader and leche spyrytuall / began to pray him and to desire
him much affectuelly saying unto him. My child I pray the here me speak.
Meruaylle nor dyspere not thy self / certainly it is troth that in the aege
and conuersacyon where I am presently I find my self much troubled and sore
traueylled with such folysshe thoughts / be not therefore of courage more feeble
for cause of such temptacyons / the which be not oonly overcome by the power
of mankind / but pryncypally by the mercy of god. And at this hour I pray
the grant me one thing. It is that having trust of the mercy of god / you will
Return again in to thyn own celle / the which thing he did full redyly. And
syn Appollo the abbot departing from him / went unto the celle of the foresaid
old fader to whom the said Relygyouse had showed his thoughts and
temptacyons and whereof he had brought him in dysperacyon. And he being night by
it / he prayed god humbly in great habondau^ce of teeres / saying. Lord god
that for the profit of thy servants / sendest to them needful temptacyons.
I beseech the right humbly that it will please the to turn in this aeged
fader the battle and temptaco^n that this young brother suffers / to the end
yt in his present old aege he learn by veraye experyence / that which he
could not ^erue by long process of time / and that by this mean he may have
compassyon of thoos yt he trowbled with such temptaco^ns. The which oryson
fynysshed by the said holy fader Appollo / he saw a spytyte of hell as black
as an Ethyopyen being nygh by the celle of the said old fader shotyng at him
many arowes and darts / with which y perced / he soon as dronk of wyn resyd
and fell done here and there and could not stand upon his fete. And where he
might no more bear nor endure this persecuco^n / he was constrained to issue
out of his celle and to go the same way that the said young Relygyouse first
went when he would return to the world again.

The abbot appollo knowing this befall / came against him / and in coming neir
hy^ said / whether ghost you my brother. I see well that you art troubled / tell
me the cause plainly of thy trouble. The old fader knowing yt this holy abbot
wist some what of his befall / was overcome and taken with so great shame that
he could not speak nor answer to him nothing. And morouer said the said
Appollo to him. Return return to thy celle / and know from hensforth thyn
own greyff and feebleness and think in thy self / that you have be unknown of
the devil / and of him despised unto this hour. For yt which thing yt have
not meryted nor dyscerned after thy virtues to have any bataylles or
wrastlynges against him. I say morouer / yt you art he ye one day alone has
not mow bear ne sustain the temptyng or entycyng of him. And this thing is
happed to the / because that in receyuyng the young Relygyouse within thy celle
and hery^g his thought of the which he trowed to have be conseylled of the
where as you sholdest have given unto him a good courage and have warned him by
words consolatyue to resyst against the temptaco^ns of the devil / the have
brought him in to fynall dysperacyon / not having remembrance of the right
wise commandment / by the which it is commanded to us / that we shall take
of ye fendes hands those that he conduyteth and leddeth to death. And an other
yt says. Be not neclygente to bey and save thoos that you knew to be in
danger to be slain. Also you have not had in thy mind the parable of our
blessed savior Ihesu christ saying / that men ought not to break altogydre a
sonder the read which is bruised or crased nor put out the wood that makes
smoke. Certainly the infyrmyte of mankind should never have puyssau^ce to bear
the spyenges and wayntyng of the fend nor to put out or withholde the fire of
nature sederyng if our lord god by whose helthfull prouydyng all things are
ordained thrughe his godly strength / kept and conserved it therfro. Let us
then pray god togydre / that it will please him to torn ye flayell which he
has cast against the. For it is he yt makes the pacyent folk to sorrow and yt
restores them to their health / his hand smyteth / and after it heleth / he
meketh the proud / he exalts them yt be humble / he sleeth and quyckeneth /
he makes the sinners to descend in to hell / and brings them out again. And
in sayng these things / the said abbot Appollo ended his oryson / and anon
the said old fader was delivered of the temptaco^n yt to him was put. And the
said Appollo cou^seylled him / that he should ask and require of god a
dyscrete tongue and word Instructyue to be unto him given / to thentent that he
might have knowloge when and how he should leave or counseylle a good word.

The abbot Syrus of Alexandrye y questyoned of a Relygyouse upon this that he
said / that he had no thought or temptaco^ns of fornycacyon / answered unto
hy^. if you have not any thoughts or temptaco^ns / you may not have no hope.
For it must be supposed that you have in the some werkynges / that is to say /
that he yt by thought fyghteth not against the sins and does not there against
he synneth bodily / and he that synneth bodily has another gryesses nor unrest
of thoughts.

An aeged fader questyoned a young Relygyouse askyng to him if he was wont to
speak with wymen / whereat he answered ^ay. And morouer he said to him My
thoughts are as paynters new and old / the which with some Remembrau^ces
trowble and traueylle me of the likeness of women. The old fader said to him.
Thou ought not to dread yt deed / but you ought to flee them that he quyck that
is to say the co^sentyng and the sin in execucyon of the deed And for to do
this you ought to sprede and make thyn orysons / that is to say to tarry long
about the making of them.

The abbot Mathoys said / that a Relygyouse coming toward him / among other
things had told hy^ / that of werse condyco^n is he which bakbyteth or
speaks wrongfully behind ones back to ye harm and hurtyng of him of whom he
speaks than he yt does co^myse ye sin of fornycaco^n / whereat ye old fader
had answered unto hy^ / yt this word was much hard and strong. The brother
heryng this answer / required hy^ yt he would tell hy^ how he understood yt
the sin of fornycacyon should not be werse than the sin of detracco^n. So
answered to hy^ ye old fader sayng. My sone it is a thing of truth / yt ye
sin of detracco^n is a wicked vice / but nevertheless it is anon and
lightly withdrawn and put out for ofte^tymes it happeth / yt ye detractour
repents hy^ / and comes to hy^ of whom he has spoken evil and axed hy^
pardon / and then is his wrath passed / but naturelly death lies in the sin
of fornycacyon.

The abbot Pastor said yt all thus as they yt be ordained to keep the person
of a prince / ought to be ever ready for to deffende hy^ by arms from all
oppressyons. Likewise yt soul vtuouse ought to be ever appareylled for to
withstand against the temptaco^ns in lecherye of the fend of hell.

A young Relygyouse came ones to ye said abbot Pastor and co^playned to hy^
that he was sore tempted and tormented of ye sin of fornycaco^n / askyng
counsel of hy^ / how he should keep hy^ there from / and yet he said to hy^ /
yt for this cause he had be toward ye abbot Ibyssyon yt had answered hy^ / yt
he ought not in no wise suffer such thought to soyourne nor abide long in his
courage. Upon this the abbot pastor said unto him and answered thus / the works
and the deeds of the abbot Ibystyon are contynuelly on high, that is to say yt
co^tynuelly he co^templed the heavenly things / where by he knew not what
such temptacyons mente. But an other thing it was of this Pastor as he hy^self
said / and also of ye said Relygyouse / for they were yet subgett to
fornycaco^. So then it is needful yt we restrain our belyes and our tongues.
For the relygyouse yt this thing shall do and yt shall dwell in a solytary
place / may be well sure and certain that he shall not deye of the second
death / that is to say the death everlasting of hell.

Some told of the abbess named Sayre / that she strongly tempted of yt wicked
and dampnable ghost of fornycaco^n / during the space of.xiij. year / had
steadfastly and perseuerantly withstonde / and in this doing she never prayed
god / yt this temptaco^n or battle should depart from her / but had prayed
him oonly that it would please him to give her might and stedfastnes for to
withstonde their against. And morouer was said of her / that the said ghost of
fornycaco^n temptyng her contynuelly / was unto her sometime more great
adversary / bryngyng before her ye vanytees of this world / but she having
always the dread of god byfor her eyes and in her courage which steadfast purpose
of constance and abstynence / came ones upon her bed taking herself for to
pray god there. And in this dooyng apperyd bodily before her the ghost of
fornycaco^n that said to her / thou have overcome me Sayre. Whereat she
answered. I have not overcome the thou ghost abhomynable / but my god oonly
has overcome the / and none other.

A brother was sore stenged and pryeked of the sin of fornycaco^n / so that
he had like a glowyng stenge brennynge both day and night within his heart but
nevertheless he bataylled there against not co^descendyng or consentyng to his
thought. And after that he had fought long time / this stenge departed from
him without to do any gryef unto hy^ / by the mean of his great perseuerau^ce
/ and anon he found him self in a courage all spradde of the grace of god.

An other brother sore prycked and vexed with fornycaco^n rose by night and went
to an old fader to whom he told his mind / askyng his counseyll thereupon The
holy fader aeged recomforted and cou^seylled him so well that he went again in
to his celle all enough content of him / but nevertheless he was yet again
tempted of the said sin of fornycaco^n / wherefore also yet again he went to
the said old fader / not ones oonly but also diverse times. And this
notwithstondyng the holy fader ancient gaaf him no angry words yt might
bring nor moeue him to wrath or heaviness / but louyngly he showed to hy^ that
^ was to him necessary and prouffytable for his salvation / sayng that he
should not give over him none auctoryte to the devil / and that he should not
bow his courage / and that he should say spyttyng at him. Devil dampened
come to me / and do to me the worst that you can. I fere the not / for I shall
overcome the well. And he said that when a man says thus to the despyt of him
he departs away from the person. Morouer he said that there nys nothing
that does more lettyng to the dampened spyryte of fornycaco^n / than when he
that is prycked of hy^ reueleth and shows his stenges and pryckynges / nor
that more reioyssheth him / than when they be kept close and secret and not
showed unto some good person. The brother then went his way / and syn came
again unto the said holy fader for said.xi. times excusing hy^self of his
folysshe thoughts and evil mind. And synably he prayed him in the name of
holy charity / that he would give him some good counsel and techyng. Then
said ye holy fader to him. Belyue me my sone. I ensure the yt if god suffers
my thoughts of the which my courage is prycked and stenged to be transported
unto the ^ sholdest not conne bear them / but sholdest holy be ouerthrawen
from high to low. These things thus said and prouffered by the said holy
fader through his great humylyte the pryckyng ceased holy in the said brother
/ and did no lettyng to him no more.

Item an other y prycked with fornycaco^n took himself for to fight / and
continued his abstynen^e keeping his thought within him close by the space of
(...). year without to consent unto his concupysence the which.xiiij. year
ended because that he found hy^self ever still without teasse as sore
oppressed as he had he before one day among other coming to the ^hirthe he
opened and showed unto all there being present the greuouse passions yt he
suffered requyryng their help and socours. So was it ordained that every man
should pray for hy^. The which thing was done in devout wayllynges and
affllyecyons. After that they had continued for hy^ a weke in prayers and
oracyons / the pryckyng that prycked him within forth was utterly put out in
him and brought to naught.

An old hermyte speaking of the thoughts of fornycaco^n said. Thou that art
enclyned to sleep. If you will be saved / arise and work and give to thy poor
body traueyll and afflycco^n / seek and you shall find / wait and smite at
the door / and it shall be open to the. Thou have sometime seen and apperceyued
in this world some men strong as wastelers that have fought with cruel bestes
as to the here is and to the lions and other / the which boostyng them self to
sore and spekyng ouermoche / have showed them self strong / and by their
hardynesse and worthy corages they have be crowned like men vyctoryouse. And
sometime as a man yt is beten and hurt of two other men / he comfort himself
in his wounds / and ouercometh thoos that smyteth him. Now consydere then
what and how great virtue of strength by excercyse of his body he has geten
/ as he would say / that it has be to such a vyctoryouse man a much great
praysyng / to have overcome two other men. And after he said. Be thou then
strong and constau^ce and god shall befyght the fend for the.

Of this thought of fornycacyon an other aeged fader said. Be thou like hy^
that passes by the cokes or through a tavern and takes the savor and smell
of every mete or of drink that be sold there / and there so enters in who
so ever will for to ete and drink of the same / and he that will not thereof
gooth by his ways therfrom withstondyng against the dysordynate appetyt / that
he has had there through the smelling or savor that he has felt there / the
which he puts abake. In likewise thou ought to do / and in castyng a bake
from the this savor and stenche of fornycacyon / thou ought to arise thy self
and pray god saying. O god almighty help me. And this shall you do also against
thyn other evil thoughts Thou ought to know that we have not the strength ne
the might to pluke nor enrase out of our hertes / but we may well wrastell and
fight against them.

An other old fader said that we endure and suffer such manners of temptacyons
by our great slowthe and neclygence. For if we did think and consydere that
god dwelled and enhabyteth within us when we be in the astate of grace / we
should not ordeyne no strange vessel within us / that is to say / that we
should not give none occasyon to the fend of hell to lodge him there by sin
/ puttyng our lord away. Certainly our lord dwelling within us and with us /
he besyly beholds and keeps our life. And therefore we that bear hy^ and
contemple him in our entendementes and corages / ought not to contempne nor
despise him / but in worshyppyng him halowe our self / as he is right holy and
worthy. Let us then be constau^^ and steadfast upon the stone / that is to
say in our lord Ihesu christ / which is the stone and the foundemente of our
faith / and let us befyght the wicked spyryte / and say every one in him
self that yt the holy prophet Dauyd says in his spalter. They that trust in
god and that be steadfast and constau^t / as the montayne of Syon / which is
among all other the highest and the strongest / and the which shall be never
dysmoeued / shall not be overcome of the temptacyons of the fend / but shall
come at the last to Iherusalem the sovereign Cite which is tokenyd vysyon of
peace.

A young Relygyouse questyoned an aeged fader sayng thus. If a Relygyouse
re^neth in to some sin / he is scorged and tourmented in spyryte / as he that
that leueth to do his proffyte and falls in to pouerte / and seeing his
astate thus changed / he ceasseth not to labor and traueyll till that he
comes up again from his pouerte / and that he be set again in his first astate
And he that come from the world to take and live a solytary life / he is
lykened unto him that forsakes and dyspyseth his enmye / and begins to
prouffyte for him self. Then he axed him how he ought to lead him self for
to eschew to these inconuenyences. The old fader answered unto him / that a
monk which is assailed and tempted of the fend / is like a house which is
in danger for to fall done / but and if in his temptacyons / he ledeth
himself sobrely withstondynge against them / he buyldeth the house up again
which was in way for to fall and he fyndeth matters good and proffytable to
the buyldyng again of the same / as good and strong prayers for to set and
make withal the fou^dementes / and sand to make mortar withal and other
things that be necessary to the foresaid buyldyng. And in this house thus
strongly builded he profyteth. But he that delueth not in the earth for to set
the foundementes / and is unpurveyed of such things yt be needful to the
reedyfyeng of the said buyldyng / but lives under a hope he passing forth ye
time / if his house by some wise happeth to be fulmade / yt is a thing hard
and strong for to be done and in great adventure. And all thus it is of a
Relygyouse / the which after that he is fallen in temptaco^n / if he turned
him self to godwarde / than may he have a great appetyt to buyldyng / that is
to wit / to think upon gods laws to read psalms / to labor and to pray
and to do such things that be the fou^dementes and buyldynges of holy
Relygyon. But he that begins of new / and yt is new in conuersacyon / he
fyndeth this manner of buyldyng right strange unto time he has learned these
things.

A brother Relygyouse which was tempted of the sin of fornycacyon / went
toward an other holy fader well famed / and prayed him yt he would wonthesauffe
for his lernyng and showing yt he had a love and charity toward him / to pray
god that he would give him some comfort for to withsta^de against the said
temptaco^n which thing the holy fader did. And an other time after came the
said Relygyouse again / making unto this old fader such an other Request
which he granted him and prayed our lord for him saying. My god I pray the
that it wyyll please the to show unto me whereof this evil te^ptacyon comes
to this brother / that he fyndeth therein another end nor Rest / how be it I
have prayed the so long for him. And anon after our lord made him upon his
request such a reuelacyon / that is to wit / that he saw the said young
relygyouse syttyng idle without any work that he made / the ghost of
fornycaco^n by him and playng with him. And at the other side of hy^ was the
angel of god that was sent unto him for his help which was wroth and not
content / that he cast not himself done to the earth for to pray god / but
took delectacyon and pleasure in his thoughts bowyng all his affecco^n unto
the same. The holy fader knowing that ye cause grew more of the said
Relygyouse than otherwise / did celle him that he was well informed that he
was himself cause of the contynuacyon of his temptaco^n / because he did
set his will to lightly there unto. And syn after he taught him how he should
withstand from hens forth against such temptaco^ns. Fynably the brother taking
a courage by the prayers and doctrine of the said holy fader found himself
peasyble of the said temptacyon.

The dyscyple of an old fader was ones tempted of fornycacyon. The holy fader
seeing his dyscyple fight with great labor and pain / axed him / if he would
that he should pray god for him / that he would releue him from this
vnrestfulnesse / whereat the dyscyple answered. Ha my fader I see well and
consydere / that if I have great labor and pain for to withstonde. I lose not
my lone nor my reward. I know well thus dooyng that by the weight of my
labor I prouffyte / wherefore it is not need to pray god for to take away
this temptacyon fro me / but I will well and I pray the so / that it will
please the to pray god that he will give me might and stedfastnes / by the
which I may ever fight corageously there against. The holy fader answered unto
him. Now I know my sone that thou art well dysposed for to proffyte greatly and
that you shall pass us in all virtues. Men rehearse of an old fader / that came
in to the deserts of Sychye / that he had a child so young that he was not
yet wended from the breast / and from his young age he was with his fader
norysshed in ye monastery where he kept himself / so that he wist not what
wy^men were. And when he was become a man / the deuyls showed him by night
diverse forms to the likeness of wy^men / which thing he told unto his
fader / that was sore marueylled of it. And it happed that he went ones with
his fader in to Egypt / and by the way he saw some women which he showed to
his fader sayng yt they were the same that by night came unto him in Sychye /
whereat his fader answered to him / that they were the monks of the world and
that they wered an other habyte / and the hermytes an other. And then the
holy fader woundred sore / how the deuyls showed in Sychye such images of
wy^men / and anon after they went again to their hermytage. An other relygyouse
in Sychye well named and sore withstondyng the temptacyons / was sore tempted
of the spyryte of fornycacyon / that brought often in his courage the
remembrance of a fair woman which he had known he being in the world / and
gendred within hy^ a marueyllouse temptaco^n / during the which it happed
after the will of god / that a Relygyouse coming out of Egypt came in to the
deserts of Sychye / and went to see the said Relygyouse / unto whom among
other things he showed / how this woman was deed And incontinent that this was
come^ to his knowloge / he trussed a vestymente of his own / and by night he
departed secretly out of his hermytage / and after walked so long till he
came to the place where he had herd say that she was buried. And when he was
come there / he began to delue in the earth over her grave / and rubbed and
froted his said habyte or vestement in to ye rotyn blood and in to the stenche
of the corpse of the said woman. And when he was comen again to his hermytage /
he laid the said stynkyng vestement before his face / and in correctyng and
Rebukyng his thought / said to him self. O cursed thought corrupt and Rotyn /
here is the desire that thou dedest ask / take it and fylle thy self with it.
And in this manner in smellyng of that savor and stenche he chastysed himself
sleeyng and brynghyng unto naught his dysordynate desire.

A lay man desyryng to be a Relygyouse came ones in ye deserts of Sychye / and
brought with him a child of his own that late had be wened fro the breast.
And when he was out of childhode and in the aege of yougthe the deuyls took up
them for to fight with him / and so cruel they were that he was constrained by
their temptacyons to tell his fader that he would be no more hermyte / but
would goo live with the world / saying that he could no longer bear ye
desyrynges of the flesh. His fader comforted and said to him the best that he
could / but naught auaylled his comfort. For his sone said there against that
he could no more abide the same / prayng him that he would let him goo to the
world. Then said his fader to him. My sone I pray the obey me yet ones /
take with the.xl. loves of bread and leaves and rotes for to live.xl. dayes-and
goo thy ways far within the deserte soyournyng there by the space of the
said.xl. days / abydyng that god shall do his pleasure of the. The child
obeyng to his fader arose and went in to the depest of the deserts kekyng
himself there by the space of.xx. days co^tynuelly labouryng about the making
of mattes to keep his body occupied / and ete dry bread. And after the
said.xx. days were passed / he saw a wonderful work of the devil coming
upon him / for suddenly did appyere before him in the likeness of a woman
which was black as an Ethyopyen abhomynable in syghte / and so Infecte with
stenche / that he might not endure nor suffer her by hy^ but shoued her aback
from him. And she telled him. I am she that feyne my self within the hertes of
men / to whom I give a sweet show / but withstondyng thyn obedyence and the
labor that thou herest which lets me god would not suffer that I should
follow or turn the / though I have be constrained to show the my power.

Then he kneled done and gave thankynges unto our lord. And syn after came
to his fader again and said to him. My fader I will no more goo to the world.
For I have seen now the deceyuynges of the devil and his foul stenche. His
fader also had well seen his said vysyon / and he said so to him. Ha my sone
if thou had abyden in that deserte.xl. days as I had tell the that thou
sholdest do / thou sholdest have seen greter things An other old fader held
him self in an hermytage far / he had a kynneswoman that of long time had
great desire for to see him / wherefore she made serchyng after the place where
he dwelled / and syn after she took her way toward his hermytage. She walkyng
met in her way some caryers that led many Camel / with whom she
acompanyed her self / and went so long by her Iourneys that she came with
them in to the deserts / where she tyssed and tempted by the wicked spyryte /
made such dylygence for to find the hermytage of the said Relygyouse / that
she came soon and knocked at the door / showing and gyuyng to know by
tokens and words what she was / and namely Required him that he would not
withsaye the openyng of his door to her / seen that she was his kynneswoman /
and also the good and holy affection and desire that she had unto him which
was her nyghe kynnesman. Then the Relygyouse heryng her words / and knowing
that she was of his sybbe and lygnage / opened to her his door and let her in
/ where she abode certain days with the said relygyouse. It is truth that
ferther within the deserte dwelled an other solytary Relygyouse to the which
hangyng the time that this woman was with that other relygyouse / it happed two
or three times / as he would have taken his repast / and namely when he would
drink of the water that he had put in a drynkyng vessel / that the said
vessel turned in his hand the botom upward and so spylled his water whereof
he meruaylled sore. The which thing seeing this Relygyouse he said to him
self as he was Inspyred of god. Truly I shall goo see my brethern in their
hermytages / and I shall tell them this that so often is happed to me of my
water He took on his way anon and spedde so much that on a day for fawte
of other lodgys / he was constrained to enter and lodge him self within an
old Temple that was in his way where the ydoles had be worshypped some
time. And he being there in the night time / he herd many deuyls whereof some
said to the other / that they had made a Relygyouse that night to fall in
the sin of fornycacyon. Heryng the which words / the said relygyouse was
sore trowbled in his courage. And as soon as the day was come / he took his
way in so great dylygence that he came to the hermytage of that other
Relygyouse of whom the deuyls made their boost / the which he found much
sorrowful and heavy. So did he show right well to him that that was happed
unto him of his water / and how diverse times it was spylled by it self when
he wend for to have drunk of the same. Asking of him what might be the cause
that it so happed.

Then the other Relygyouse said unto him. O my brother thou art welcome sith
it has please the for to come hither for to show unto me thine
Inconuenyences. Truly brother mine. I have well more need of thy good counseylle
and comfort / than thou have of mine. For but late agoo / I am fallen in the
sin of fornycacyon. Then answered to him his felawe. Verily my brother I
have well known thereof this night. Alas and how answered that other. Certaynely
said he in slepynge within the Temple of ydolles / which lies by the way
hetherwarde between thyn lodgys and mine. I have herd the deuyls that spaken of
the and were wonderful glad of the same sin / in which they have the
ouerthrawen. And anon the poor brother said unto him as by dysperacyon. Ha my
brother I am no more worthy to be nor acompanye whith the holy hermytes and
Relygyouses of the hermytages / certainly I will now goo presentely for to use
wretchydly my life with the folk of the world. Then the good relygyouse
required him by good charity that he should not abide in yt folly / drawyng his
trust aback from ye great mercy of god / but should take a good courage and
purpose him self for to live ever a Relygyouse life / living so lytaryly in
the deserts / as he was wont to do in time passed / and that he should
forsake and leave that cursed woman / for it was through the entytynge of the
devil that she was come there. These words herd / the poor Relygyouse
repented him of his sin by very contrycyon and great penance which he
continued long / and unto the time that he found him self better than he was
/ and in rest of conscience.

An aeged holy fader said / that three things / that is to wit / to put him
self from the business and solycytudes / to be transyble and to think in his
herto upon his sins engendre in a Relygyouse the virtue of charity.

An other Relygyouse moeued a questyon to an aeged holy fader askyng hy^ If it
happeth yt a Relygyouse falls in to some sin / so yt the other Relygyouses
be thereby sklau^dred / what remedy shall they soke upon the same. Answeryng to
the which questyon / the said holy fader fold the hystorye yt fol^weth
saying. At a monasterye in Egypt dwelled a dyaken well famed and rendured /
in whom time happeth yt a man of court / by a Judge having power of the land
was banysshed or in such wise trowbled yt he was constrained to withdraw
hy^self / which with all his meny came to ye monastery where ye said dyaken
dwelled / this courtire in the said monastery soiournyng / the said dyaken at
ye said instygaco^n entycyng of the devil co^mysed the sin of fornycaco^n
and adulterye with this courtyers wife / whereof great sclau^der and co^fusyon
moeued among the relygyouses there / wherefore he moeued by great shame and
contryco^n / went secretly unto an old fader and declared to hy^ his befall /
prayng him yt he would give him counsel to help him yt he might arise from his
grievous sin. And talkyng together / the old fader led him in to a secret
celle yt he had far within the deserte / the which celle seeing this dyaken
/ he prayed ye said holy fader / that he should burye him quycke therein / and
yt he should never tell to no body where he was. So entered he within this
dwelling yt was derke and obscure / and there he made an hard and a virtuous
penance by a long and a great space of time / during the which happed in the
land of Egypt a great dreought and scarsenesse because yt the water of Nub
that was then very small might not wete the country as she had acustomed /
Wherefore the people began to make devout prayers / letanyes and orysons prayng
our lord that he would have pity of them and to send them some water for the
mayntenynge of their poor lives. And in making these said prayers. It was
showed unto an holy hermyte by the will of god / that the water of the said
flood should not were nor grow unto the time that the dyaken which was hid
within the celle of the said holy fader in the deserts of Egypt / should come
for to pray with the other for to have the said water. The which Reuelacyon
this holy fader Incontynente showed to all the other faders / which anon
went toward the said dyaken and brought him out of the said celle. And syn
after set himself to prayers and orysons with them / and soon after the said
water grew and encreaced in so great habondau^ce that the derthe ceased /
whereby they had goods suffysaunt. And they that had be before sklau^dred and
shamed by him / were well praised syn of him for his great and hard penance /
whereof they praised and gloryfyed the name of god.

Two brethern Relygyouse went ones to a cite which was nyghe their hermytage
for to selle there their work yt they had made for to get their living. And
when they were come to the said cite / after yt they were departed ye one fro
ye other for to speed more soon their deeds / one of them fulfilled the sin
of fornycaco^n. His brother came soon again toward him / and told him that
they should return to their celles / whereat the poor sinner answered / that he
should not return thither / and why said the other / because I am not worthy
to be there any more / because that syn that you departed from me. I have
folyshly and dampnbly done the wretched sin of fornycaco^n. Then his
brother desyryng to win his soul and keep from dampnacyon / said to him in
this wise. In good sothe my brother / as much is happed unto me syn I left
the / and therefore we shall not dyspere our self / but we shall Return again
to our celles for to weep there over our sins and do penance / and god
through his mercy shall forgive us our trespasses. And incontinent that they
were gone again / they showed unto the ancient faders that / yt was happed unto
them / and they gave them such penaunces as they seemed good. In this deed is
well to be considered the great charity of the brother that had not sinned / but
for to give his brother a courage to Repent him self he was content to accuse
hy^self of a sin that he had not done and to do for hy^ as great penance as
that he had done it / wherefore god seeing his labor and good affection / within
few days after he declared to one of ye old faders / that in favor and
contemplacyon of the great charity of him that had not sinned / but desyryng
the health of his brother / had done as great penance as he / he had quyted
and forgyuen him his offense. Whereby it may be said verily of him that does in
this manner / that without doubt he puts his soul in plege for the soul of
his brother. An other brother came to an old fader / saying that by a brother
of his he had be Induced to so great varyablenesse and unsteadfastness in
ledyng him in diverse places syn here syn there / that he was thereby soore
scorged and trowbled in his courage. The good fader heryng his words said to
him. My brother bear pacyently the evil of thy brother / and god that shall
see thy good courage / and that you do thy deuoyre for to call hy^ again
swetly to a good life / shall adresse him unto the in time couenable. Certainly
when a body has conceived in hy^ some evil thought it is not a thing to be
called lightly again by sharp and bitter words / for one devil put not out yt
other / but by swetenes and mekenes men may lightly and soon revoke a great
sinner. For our lord has this manner to draw unto him the men by swetenes.
And after showed unto him / that two brethern had be in Thebayde / one of
which was so sore tempted of the sin of fornycaco^n / yt for to accomplysshe
it in deed he purposed to return again to dwell in ye world but ye other heryng
his folyshe intencion / began to weep sore and said to him. My brother I shall
not sete the go fro me for to go lose thy labor and thy virgynyte. The other
answered yt he should no more dwell in the hermytage / saying to him yt if he
would bear him company he should come again with him / and if he would not / he
should not come again His brother heryng his words went for to take counsel of
an aeged fader for to wit of him what he might best do for to keep him. To whom
this fader cou^seylled yt he should goo with his brother / and that god that
knew his good will and the pain ye he should take for to withdraw hy^ again /
should not suffer yt he should fall in sin So went he to the world with his
brother and they passing by a street / god consyderyng the labor of the good
brother that by good charity and for great necessyte followed his brother for to
keep hy^ that he should not be lost / took from him the concupyl^ence yt so
made hy^ go out of the right way. And incontinent he said to his brother that
they should go to their hermytage and yt him thought that he had sinned all
ready with some woman Alas said he and what have I gotten thereby as he would have
said / that he had entreprysed a way sore dau^gerose and damynable. So they
returned to their celle and lived there solytaryly as they were wont to do
before.

An other brother said to an old fader / what ought I for to do for to keep me
from the foul thoughts of lecherye that tourmente me. Whereat the holy fader
answered / yt a woman when she will wene her child and keep him fro the breast
/ she puts upon her pappes some thing bitter. And when the child will take
the pappe for to draw it as he is acustomed / and feleth the bytternesse that
is there upon / he forsakes it anon. Likewise when such folyshe thoughts
and temptacyons shall hap to come upon the / consydere the fylthe and stenche
that ryseth thereof / the gryuouse offense that thou sholdest do against god if
thou dydest the sin / and the horrible pain that thou sholdest suffer
euerlastyngly if thou deydest suddenly in that astate / the which thing
falls every day to many one.

An other brother questyoned an other aeged upon a like ^aas and sin the
which answered unto him that he never was prycked nor stynged with that sin.
The brother heryng his answer was wounderfully sklau^dred with it and gretely
ashamed. And so went to an other fader / and told him what the other had
said to him / whereof he was ylle content / because him thought that his
answer was above nature. For him seemed to be Impossyble but that he should
have be often times trowbled with the temptacyon of the said sin. The old
fader said unto hy^ ye man of god has not told yt thoos words symply and
vnauysydly / but for to have ye declaraco^n thereof / you shall go again to hy^ and
shall pray him / that he will pardonne the / the evil thynkyng ye you have had
upon his person / and morouer yt he will expowne unto the the virtue of his
words. This brother then came again to the holy fader foresaid / and repentyng
himself / said unto him. Good fader please the to forgive me my folly / in
asmoche yt I am departed fro the without leave to be taken of the / and morouer
I beseech the / that you will expowne unto me / how it can be that you have never
be prycked nor tempted of the sin of fornycacyon. Then the old fader
answered unto him. My brother I shall tell it the. I ensure the ye syn I did
yield me first to Relygyon. I have not ete so much of bread ne dronken so
much of water that I could say that ever I took ones my fylle with it. Also
in likewise I never slepte as long as mine appetyte desired / and so I have
kept myself from metes / whereof some other be wont to use. And in this manner
trauayllynge my body. I have brought hit so low that it was not suffered me yt
I should feel the pryckynges of the flesh. Then went away the brother
taking leave of the holy fader / and syn profyted much in conuersaco^n and
amendment of life by the ensample of the said aeged fader.

An other brother moeued a questyon unto an other fader au^cyente / saying.
Fair fader what owe I to do. I cannot change my thought from the sin of
fornycaco^n / whereof I am so sore tourmented / that I may not have an hour
oonly any rest. The old fader answered to him. My sone when the deuyls
presented the some lecherouse thought is in thy heart whereof he feleth hy^
somewhat prycked / you ought not to speak thereof nor to think upon it in thy
courage / for it lo^geth to ye deuyls for admynyster wylyly such thoughts /
and all be it so yt they be sore curyouse and besy for to put them in to ye
hertes of ye persons / always it is not to the^ possible for to make them
abide therein / but if they will hemself / wherefore you ought to know and not
fere / but ye you may receive or forsake them when you wylt. And to this
purpose may be applied this yt ye Madyanitees did when they made fair and
clad their thoughters / and put them in ye sight and before ye presence of ye
childern of Israel. For they constrained not none of them for to have do
carnaly with ye said wy^men / but they yt folysshly did set their love upon
them / did what they would with them / and then the Madyanites angered and
moeued against them yt had defoyled their daughters / thretned ye other / but
they took vengeance of ye fornycatours / which they brought all to death. And
thus have you for to do of ye lecherouse te^ptaco^ns in castyng them from the /
to the end yt they be not cause of ye death. Then answered ye brother. Good
fader ye counsel me right well / but what shall ye answer to me of that I am
weyke and so feeble that this passion ouercometh me. Thou must set all thyn
affection said the holy fader to withstonde. And when ye deuyls shall enforce
them for to moeue thy heart for to think evil or to speak some ylle answer
them not in no wise / but arise for to pray god and do penance saying. O
sone of god have mercy upon me. Ha good fader said the brother. I shall do well
this / at lest I am well in a thought to do so / but I have not in mine heart
no manner of co^punccion. For I can not understand ye virtue of the words of
the oryson yt you tellest to me. Well said the holy fader if you understand
nothing of it / thou shall think oonly thereupon. For I have herd say the
abbot Pastor / and also other old faders this word / that is to wit yt the
enchauntour knowing not perfyghtly what betoken the words by the means of
which he makes his incantaco^ns / but always he knows that by such words
spoken to the serpent yt hereth them / that self serpent is incontinent
enchau^ted. Likewise how well that we know the virtue of the words that we
put forth in our orysons / always the deuyls when they here them they aferde
thereof and by the virtue and dread of the same / they goo from us.

Some ancyent said yt the thought of fornycacyon is as freylle and as light for
to break as paper. For if the happeth to come upon us and that we refuse her
and cast her behind us / she is of light overcome. It is then needful that
we have dyscreco^n in our thoughts and cogytacyons / by the which we have to
know / that they yt consent to them ought not to have thus dooyng any hope to
be saved / but they yt withstand against them may and owe to wait for their
reward the crown of vyctory in the Royalme of heaven.

Two brethern sore assaylled and tempted of the sin of fornycaco^n / not
having before their eyes the dread of god nor the memory of the health of their
souls / as foles and out of wit forsook and left their hermytages / and
ledyng each of them a common woman with them / went and accompanied certain
space of time among the worldly folk. And after that they had thus wantonly
lived / one of them showed to the other their unhappy and wicked living / and
said to him such words. Let us consydere and take heed what goods we lose /
that living so wyckedly we leave the life of angels for to accompanye and us to
defoyle in so stynkyng a fylthe / the which shall be cause unto us for to go
in to broundes and tourmentes that ever shall last. I pray the my brother let
us goo again to the hermytage and do penance for the sins that we have
done so presumptuously.

The which thing they purposed and were delyvered for to do. And following
their delyberacyon came to the deserts where as they found the aeged holy
faders / to whom right humbly and in great contrycyon they besought that they
would receive them to penance as they did.

And after that they had made an hoole confession of all their sins / the
ancient faders did shytte them within their celles / where as they were by
the space of a year where as they made to be admynystred to them a little bread
and a little water for to sustain their lyffe withal / as much to the one as
to the other. For also they were both y like of face and of aege. And after
that / that they had done their penance and that they were loos again and
let out of their celles / the holy fader seeing the one of them to be
wonderful pale and heavy / and that other much boystouse and glad / they
wondered sore upon / withstanding that to either of them / and as much to the
one as to the other / there living indyfferently had be admynystred unto them /
wherefore they moeued a questyon unto him that so pale and heavy was / askyng him
what deeds he had had in his thoughts during the time of the penance that he
had been in his celle / whereat he answered. In good sothe said he. I have had
ever in Remembrance the pains and tourmentes that I have deserved / and in
which I was aferde to come / for the great abhomynable and vile sins that I
have done. And for this cause and for the great dread that I took thereof. I am
become thus dry and lene by the contynuelly ensyght that I had thereupon. In
son much that my bones have perced and yet perce my flesh as ye see. And
after they questyoned the other sayng. And thou brother what thought had
thou in thy celle. The Relygyouse answered. I rendered contynually graces and
thanks unto my god of that it had pleased him to deliver me out of the fylthes
and uncleanness of this world / and from the pains and tormenees everlasting
/ in calling me again to this angels life. And in Remembryng my self of the
great mercyes of my god. I wexed glad in my self as yet still I do. The
which words herd of the said aeged faders / they Iuged that their penance
was like and semblable toward god / and thanked them.

An ancient holy fader was in the deserts of Sychye / the which fylle in a
great sykenesse / and for to Releue him therfrom / many brethern besyed them
curyously for to serve and admynyster unto him all his necessytees as well as
they could. This holy fader consyderyng the pain and traueyle that they took
and bore about him / thought in him self for to goo in to Egypt /
notwithstanding his said sykenesse and gryeff and said to the abbot Moses that
for to dyscharge these brethern of the pains and veracyons that he gaaf unto
them he would goo there.

The abbot Moses said unto him My brother if thou will belyue me thou shall
not goo there / for if thou goo there / thou shall not come again without thou
shall fulfylle there the sin of fornycacyon.

The old fader wroth of this answer said again to him / why say thou so
my brother / thou know well seen that my body is already deed / that this is
not well said of the by me / and thou show in that saying / that thou
set little by me and of my salvation. Forsothe sith that I have purposed to
go there. I shall not dyfferre but I shall goo.

So he departed and went in to Egypt and incontinent that he was come there
many honorable persons dwelling in diverse places all enough nygh his
resydence / for the love that they ought unto him and to his right honest
co^uersaco^n / they offered themself to hy^ and made to hy^ great seruyces / and
among yt other came there a good virgyne that besyed her for to serve him /
admynystrynge unto him such things that were needful for his sykenesse. And
within a while after he coming again somewhat to his health / was so wonderfully
tempted of the fend of hell / yt he entycyd the same virgyne / in such manner
that she consented that he should have her company flesshely / and wexed great
in deed of his work. She y moeued to questyon of them that dwelled in the
places about / of whom she had conceived she answered that it was of the deed
of the old fader / but they belyued it not. And he him self said yt he had
done the same. The time of chyldyng came to hand that she had a child / which
the holy fader foresaid prayed that he should be kept / and after that he was
wened fro the breast / the said old fader seeing that a solemn feste should
be shortly hallowed in Sychye / he took this child and bare him to the church
before a great multitude of Relygyouses The which thing seeing the said
relygyouses they began all to weep / wenyng to them that he had be mad and
taken from his wyete. He said then to them. My brethern see you this child
it is ye child of inobedyence. I pray you that in consyderyng the great
mysbehauyng which I have done in mine old days ye will take heed unto your
self to the end that ye ^enne not in to so dau^gerouse and dampnable way / as
the same where I am run unto / and that it will please you to pray god for
me that it will please him of his great mercy and bou^te to pardo^ne and
forgive me my greuouse sins and offenses. From thens he departed and went to
his celle again where he made meruayllouse and great penance for the same sin
/ by mean of the which he brought hy^ self again through the grace of our lord
to the astate of holy conuersacyon and good living.

A brother was sometime tempted of the sin of fornycaco^n by diverse fendes of
hell / the which chaungyng in to diverse manners of fair wy^men during the
space of.xl. days contynually befought and tempted hy^ for to withdraw him to
do and acomplysshe the horrible and foul sin of lechery. But he withstode
their temptacyons and dysceytes so manly and so steadfastly / that they could
not moeue him for to do or fulfill the said sin. Wherefore our lord seeing his
good courage / by the which he had bataylled so well / did give unto him this
grace / that he suffered never more sith that time any here of flesshly
concupyscence.

An other there was in the low parties of Egypt the which was much solytary
/ and among the other well rena^med / for he kept himself alone in the church
in a place desert. He being ^here / by the suggestyon and temptacyon of the
devil / a woman or dyshonest and of evil fame that had herd tell many
wonderful things of the said Relygyouse moeued a questyon to some men that
talked of him / and said to them what thing will you give me / if I can deceive
him in so much that he shall have my bodily company in fulfyllynge the sin
of lecherye.

They heryng these words / and trustyng that she could not do yt she said /
submytted themself to give her some what / as they should agree together / the
which couenau^te made / she upon an even feynyng herself walkyng toward some
pelgrymage and yt she had lost her way / came to the celle of the said good
holy man / and smote so at his door that he was constrained to open it / and
seeing this woman he was sore troubled and abashed / and said thus to her /
woman / how art thou comen hither. And then weeping feynyngly she answered
unto him / that bycase she had lost her way and wist not where she should go
because she met no body by the way / she was come there / prayng him that
for to keep and preserve her from danger and inconuenyence / he would in way
of good charity receive her for yt night / which thing he did / and closed
her within a little closett or cotage which was a little from his celle. Soon
after she began to cry and call saying. Alas fair fader the bestes eten me
here. I pray the open me thy door. The good holy fader heryng this cry he was
more moved and troubled than he had be before / and feryng the wrath of god said
unto him self. Alas and whereof may come to me this trouble / nevertheless
having of her compassyon / he opened his door and took her within him. And
inco^tynent the wicked fend of hell began to prycke and to shot against him
the arowes of concupyscence / and to peerse and stynge his heart with ye
thought of this woman. And where he thought in himself that it was the devil
that thus tempted and stenged him / he began to say. I see now well yt these
tenebrouse and derke thoughts come of the fend of hell. And by contrary
thoos that be clear and bright come of the sone of god. And sayng this words
he lyghted a candell / and when his desire enfla^med him or else that by the
same desire he was taken with the stynkynge delectacyon of lechery / he said in
this wise. I wot and know well yt they that done such sins descenden and
fall in to the horrible tourmentes of hell. Wherefore I will preue by my self
/ if by the fire of this candell I may by any wise suffer the pain of the fire
of hell. And this sayng he put his finger in to the fla^me of the candell /
and because that he felt it not brenne for cause of the great brounde of
lecherye with the which he was enfla^med wonderfully / he continued all that
night brennyng him self at fla^me of the said candell / so that in this
doing / till the morrow in the morning he burnt and bruled all his fyngers.
Then the wretchyd and unhappy woman seeing yt the said holy man did /
brought herself in great fere and dread and immovable as a stone. Then came
thereby yt morrow next thoos young persons to whom she had promised that she
should do so much yt he should sin with her flesshly / and they axed to this
holy man if there was not a woman come unto him upon even byforn / whereat he
answered ye / and poyntyng her with the finger said to them. Yonder ye may see
her a sleep / and they went in trowyng to have waked her out of her sleep / and
they found her deed. And they said again to the holy man as all aferde / that
she was decessed. Then he dysceueryng hy^ self from a noughty mau^tell yt he
had on showed unto them his hands all burnt sayng to them. See my friends
what this daughter of the devil has done to me this night / she has
dystroyed and wasted away my fyngers And after he said to them yt he found in
holy scripture our lord to have said that men ought not to yield evil for
evil / wherefore Incontinent he began to pray god for her / and his prayer
made she anon came to live again. And from that time she turned her evil life
/ and spend the remenau^t of ye same living chastely and holyly.

An other brother tycyd and sore tempted of the said sin of fornycaco^n / one
time among other he went to a town in Egypt where the dwellers of ye same
worshyped the ydolles. And he seeing there the daughter of the priest of the
law pagane / was taken of the love of her / so yt he came hy^ self toward
her fader / and required hy^ yt he would give her to hy^ to a wife. Whereat the
priest answered yt he should not give her to him till he had had the counsel
of his gods thereupon. So yede he to speak with the devil which he
worshypped and said to hy^. My god here is a monk yt will take my daughter to
his wife / I require and beseech the yt it will please the to teache and tell
me if I ought to give her unto hy^ / or what I ought to do in this byhalfe.
Then the devil answered unto him / yt if he would make hy^ to fulfylle three
things / the first is to forsake his god / the second to for sake his
crystendom / and the third to forsake and leave his Relygyon. In this dooyng /
and not else / he should grant and give unto him his daughter to be his
wife. The priest then his answer understand and herd / returned toward
the monk / and to hy^ said and showed yt he should give hy^ his daughter if he
would do these three things / whereof the monk was well content of this
answer. And after yt he had promised hy^ to do that he had said to him / him
thought by likeness yt he saw as a white dove come out and depart from his
mouth and floughe to the heaven. And after this the priest went again to the
devil / and told hy^ how the monk had promised him for to do and fulfill
these foresaid three things. Then the devil defended him / that nevertheless
he should not give his daughter unto that monk / for his god had not yet
forsaken him / but was yet to his help So came again the priest to hy^ and said
/ that he was not yet dysposed for to give him his daughter / because that his
god helps him yet / and was not departed from him. The Relygyouse herynge
these words said to him self. If my god shows to me his goodness so great
/ all be it that I unhappy and wretchyd have forsaken hy^ / and my baptesme and
my Relygyon / and yet where I have done one so great and horrible a sin /
has would and will yet help me now. Alas and why should I go from hy^ Then
he retournyng to himself again changed his evil purpose and came again to ye
hermytage toward an aged holy fader / to whom he told and reherced all these
things / the which y herd the holy fader enjoined him that he should hold
him and fast the space of three wekes during within a pytte that was within the
said hermytage / and this hangyng he should pray for him. And this did the
relygyouse with a good will. And syn the old fader departed from him / and
prayed our lord for hy^ sayng. O my god I pray the right humbly / that it will
please the to give me the soul of this poor and wretched sinner / and to
receive agreeable his penance / the which oryson and request our lord herd.
And when the first weke of the three was at an end he yede toward the
Relygyouse doing penance / and questyoned him / askyng to him how he felt
himself / and if he had seen any thing whereby he should have a hope to be
saved / whereat the said relygyouse answered ye / saying morouer that in the
hyghenesse of heaven he had seen a down / being sore high over against his
head. Then said to him the holy fader Take ever a besy keep of thy self /
and pray god be syly / and so went from him unto the end of the second weke
that he came again toward him as he had done before. And axed him if he had seen
any thing / and he answered that he had seen the said down coming nygh his
head. So commanded hy^ the holy fader that he should ever have a good thought
/ and that he should continue to pray god. Fynably the third weke fynysshed
he came again to him and questyoned as before if he had seen any thing more / to
whom he answered sayng. I have seen the down which is come and has set her
self upon my head / and moeuyng my hand trowyng to have taken her / she
raised her self incontinent and is entered in to my mouth. The which thing
herd / the holy fader began to yield graces unto our lord. And after said to
the relygyouse. My friend thou may by this vysyon know clearly / yt god has
received agreably thy penance. And therefore from hens forth take heed to thy
self / and see that thou fall not again in sin. The Relygyouse answered. Ha
my fader I thank the of thy good counseylles / for by the same thou have be
the cause to make me have the mercy of god / but if it be thy pleasure / you
shall be content / that from hens forthon and unto the death I shall dwell with
the / the which thing the holy fader granted him.

An old relygyouse named Thebeyen told that he was the sone of priest paynem
sacryfyeng ydoles / and that he being a young child and in the Temple with the
other little childern / he saw many times his fader sacrefye to the ydoles /
and one time among other he entered secretly within the Temple where he saw
Satan syttyng in auctoryte with all his chyualry which of a great multitude
of deuyls being about him / one of the which come first and presented him
before him / worshyppyng him with great Reverence / to whom Satan asked fro
whens he came. And he andswered to him / that he came from a Prouynce which he
named / where as he by subtle means had moeued and raised great wars
dyuysyons and bataylles unto wonderful shedyng of man's blood the which
thing I am come for to show it unto the. Then Satan asked him / how long
he was about the ymagynyng of so worthy a work done by him. Whereat he
answered..xxx. days / which answer y herd / Satan commanded that he
should be well bound and scorged / saying haste thou wasted so long time
about so fair a deed. Then came an other that in likewise worshypped Satan
And he asked him fro whens he came. The devil answered him. I was late in the sea where I have moeued great storms / by mean of which I have done perysshe
many ships / and there great trowbles I have also made whereof great slaughter
of men has ensued. So am I now come for to show it unto the. Satan asked him
as he did to the other / how long he was about the same. And he answered that
he had done it in.xx. days. Always Satan made them to be scourged and beten
as the other was / sayng that he had be over long time about the same. After
this came the third that made him Reverence as the other had done / and told
him that he came from a Cite that he named / in which and at certain
weddynges that were made there he had moeued wonderful noyses and debates
where many men and wymmen had slain each other and namely the spouse had
be slayue there / saying morouer that he had moeued and done all this great
myschyef there in.x. days oonly. Satan nevertheless made him to be beten and
welcomed as the other were before / because he had be to long about the
making of the same. Fynably came a fore him the fourth that worshypped him as
the other had done / and laid unto him how he came from the deserts where he
had soyourned and vaked the space of.xl. year for to have made a monk to
fall in to sin / and during the said time he could never bring him down to
do it unto that night / but the same night he had ouercomen him / for he
had made him do the sin of fornycaco^n. The which thing heryng the wicked
Satan / he rose Incontynence from his set and came and kyssed him in his
feerfull and horrible vysage / and syn took a crown from his head and set it
upon the head of the wyked tend / and made him set done in a sete by him /
saying thus to him. Thou art a valiant devil / thou haste fought worthyly and
have done a great thing After all the which things thus herd and seen / the
said Relygyouse being yet a young child as he said / he concluded and said to
him self / that the order of monks was a great and a worthy thing. So left
and forsook he from the same hour both fader and mother and all worldely
possessions / and went to the deserts where he made him self a monk.

An other relygyouse there was that had be a seculer and a wedded man the
which after his conuersyon to the astate of Relygyon / was sore tempted and
prycked of the sin of concupyscence desyryng ever his wife to be with him /
the which thing he reherced and showed unto the faders which seeing and
knowing this man to be expert and able to work / and he did often more
great labors than he was charged to do / did set him for to do great and
paynfull works / to thentent that his body might be febled and weyked so that
he should not be so soon moeued against his spyryte And it happed by the
suffrau^ce of god that a holy fader came in to Sychye where the said Relygyouse
held him self. And as he was come to his celle and found it open / he went
and passed by / meruayllyng sore that no body came out of it against him /
wherefore he returned Incontynenet / and stood still before the door of this
habytacyon / and feeryng that by adventure the brother that dwelled there had
be syke / he thought to enter there in / and found the said brother sore syke
and ylle at ease. So he asked him what him eyled / to whom for an answer
he reherced and told / how he was come and descended from the state of a
seculer man to the astate of Relygyon. And because that the devil tempted him
of the Remembrance of his wife / he had gone toward the holy faders to
whom he had reherced and showed his caas. The which for to take away from
him this fantasye or temptacyon / they had or deyned and set to him diverse
and sore great charges. And where he would do and fulfylle the same / he had
found him self so feeble that he could not perform them / and always this
temptacyon left him not / whereof he was much noyouse and dyspleasaunt. The
holy fader heryng these words was wroth and sorry therefore / and said to him.
Certes my brother / the faders and mighty men have well set to the charges
whereof thou art agryued / but nevertheless if thou wylt belyue my little
counseyll thou shall yet do otherwise. And as for me I counseyll the that thou
leuest all hand works / and for to bring the up you shall take a little mete
as the time requires / and after gadryng thy strengthes togydre thou shall
set thy self a little to do the work of god / that is to say / that thou
shall set the to pray god / and shall set in him all thy thought. For by
such labor thou shall mow overcome this temptacyon And for to inform the /
our body is like a gown or other raymente / the which if hit be dylygently
treated and kept as it ought to be / may the better serve us / but if he be
evil kept / and that we be neclygente to dyspose him as it apparteyneth / it
rotyth and wastes. The brother heryng this counseyll did as the holy fader
had told him / and within few days the said temptacyon left him.

There was a another relygyouse much solytaryly / and greatly strong in
conuersacyon / which dwelled in the montayne toward the parts of Anthynoe /
of whoos holy words and virtuous works many prouffyted greatly So was the
devil of hell for his holy life and conuersacyon moeued to envy against him /
as he is wont to be enuyouse against the holy and virtuous men. And waytyng
for to deceive him did bring in to his mind such an ymagynacyon / that is to
wit / that unto him which was of such conuersacyon / was another leyfull nor
good to let him self be served or to suffer his necessytees to be admynystred
unto him by other men / which he ought to serve himself and admynystre unto
them that was necessary to them. And if he might not or would not do to them
no service / at the lest he ought to serve his own self / and not let them
from their virtuous works to be done by them for their salvation / wherefore
he dysposed him for to go to the next Cite by for to selle there some panyers
and maundes that he had made / to the end that he should bye of the money
that he should have thereof such things that were needful for his living
without to give any body traueyll or charge wherefore he might be let by. And
how be it that in this his purpose was some likeness of good / nevertheless the
devil that was enuyous of the rest and tranquylyte of the conscience of the
said relygyouse / and of the byhoyffull time that he had to the service of
god / to the prouffyte and salvation of many one had brought tofore him this
folysshe ymagynacyon pretending of all parts to take him in his grymes and to
make him fall in sin which seemed him not to be possible or at the lest
hard or not to be done lightly but if he made him to company and hau^te with
the folk of the world. Then this Relygyouse following his purpose which
served him good and Just / departed from his dwelling place and came to the
Cite for to do that that he had supposed for to do. And because that every
body had him in great merueylle for his holy life by cause of the which he
was sore famed and named among the worldly folk / he held him self there
more long than it was need for him to do not taking head to the sleyghte and
wyckednes of the fend / which in spyeng and lokyng for an hour conuenyent
and necessary for to deceive him / presented unto hy^ the sight of a young
daughter full fair / whereof he was Incontinent taken with the fire of
concupyscence. And through the business and couenable time that the devil gaaf
to both parts / they went togydre / so that they know each other
flesshely. And after the dampnable sin fulfilled / knowing this Relygyouse
to have be deceived / he departed and came to the deserte / the devil always
following of nyghe / unto time that he came to a water where he let him self
fall done by the shorts / and thynkyng that the devil should be glad of
his myshappe or falling / he would dyspere himself / namely because he said
that he had angered our lord and his holy angels / and had done great
sklaunder and shame to the holy faders / and namely to many that had used the
Cytees / and were yet dwelling there without to have be overcome by the
temptacyons of the devil. And lokyng that he was not worthy to lyken and
compare himself to one of them / was full sore troubled in his courage / and
remembered not himself of the bounte and mercyfulnesse of god / that gives
virtuous courage to thoos that deuoutely turn them self to him. He then
blinded and not seeing the Remedy of his sin / he would have cast and
drown himself within the said flode to the end he should reioysshe perfytly the
devil of hell. And of the sorrow and great tourmentyng of his courage he was
meruayllously ^yke and febled of his body whereof he was in such wise
dysperate / that if the great mercy of god had not given him counsel and
help afterward / he should have deyed without repentance to the great Joy
and parfytte gladness of the wicked fend of hell. Fynably he thynkyng in him
self to return unto god / by great labor of penance and in teerys and
sobbynges hy^ to beseech to have mercy of hy^ returned again to his habytaco^n
and monasterye. And as soon yt he was come there / closed his door / shettyng
the same as he had be decessed and deed. And there he set himself to weep
making for his sin right humble supplycacyons and devout prayers unto our
lord. And fasting and contynuyng in watchynges and great traueylles febled and
wekyd wonderfully his body / but it was not yet in his courage yt he had done
suffysaunt penance. And when any brethern came toward him for to ask him
counsel of some thing profitable / and prayde him to open his door /
nevertheless he would not open it to them / sayng yt it lay not in him to do
it / because yt by oath he had strayned hy^ self from openyng his door a year
during / and to make there all that while fruytfull penance / but he prayed
them yt they would pray god for him. And all be it yt they were sklau^dred in
him and ylle content of that they had herd say of hy^ because they held him
to be honorable and a virtuous Relygyouse / nevertheless he enforced not
himself for to lay unto them any excusaco^ns / but set al his intent and
affection to abide and continue in fastings and devout orysons that he did a
hole year during making his penance. Hangyng the which time and on the
resurrecco^n night of our lord / this holy fader desyryng to know if his
sin was forgyuen to him / he took a new lantern and garnysshed it with a
lamp and after did set it within a new cawdron and covered it with a
lydde. And this done / he set him self to oryson sayng. O my god right
merciful and pyteouse yt will and desires every one to be saved and to come
to ye knowloge of thyn steadfast troth / I at this hour come unto the to
help / as to the very savior of thy good and true servants / and
notwithstanding yt I have offended the sore / obeyng and pleasynge to the fend
of hell / so that obeynge hy^ I am fall to death everlasting. Always my god /
because I wot and know yt by thy great mercy you art always ready and wyllyng
to have pity of ye wicked folk / and of thoos yt be not merciful / when they
turn themself again toward the. I beseech the my god yt it will please the to
have pity of mine humylyte / as you may do it / for to the is nothing
Impossyble. And suffer not ye my soul the which you have created and made
after thyn own symylytude which is already by sin brought to the gates of
hell / fall nor enter therein / but as you art merciful and pyteouse of thy
meke nature depart with her thy great mercy. And in that steadfast faith and
bylyue yt I have of thyn endless might / by the which ye day of the general
resurreccion is comen / you shall not oonly reyse the bodies / yt you have already
formed / and that now be deed / and also all thoo yt are to be born and shall
yet be by the created it will please the to here my right humble request and
prayer / having pity of my ghost long syn deed / and of my soul so much
unhappy defoyled and spotted with ye fylth of sin / and in likewise of mine
abhomynable body which I have so much dysguysed and made foul / that I may
no more live / because namely yt I have not had in ye steadfast belyue. Alas sire
pardo^ne me by penance my sin which is double / as well because of the
brekyng of thy commandments / as of dysperaco^n / and quyckenyng my
contrycion / command sire yt this lantern be kyndled with thy fire / to
the end yt taking trust of thy mercy and Indulgence during the other part of
the time yt you shall give me grace to live in this world. I may curyously and
dylygently keep as I ought to do thy worthy commandments / and without to
depart from thy dread by all ye days of my life I may serve the devoutly. And
on the said Resurrecco^n night of our lord sayng these words with great
shedyng of teeres he arose from his oryson for to see if the said lantern
should be kyndled / so he took of ye side from the said cawdron but he found
it in such astate as when he did put it there wherefore yet again layeng flat
his vysage to ye earth he prayed god sayng. O my lord and my god. I wot well
yt you have ordained that I should fight against ye devil to the end / I might be
crowned / but I have not be steadfast ne constau^t in asmoche yt for the
delectaco^ns of ye flesh. I have chosen to be tormented in hell. Sire please
the to pardo^ne me. I confess yet again to thy dyuyne bounte my fylthe and
wickedness / and not oonly before the same I confess it / but also before thy
holy saints and blessed angels / and them I should confess before all men /
if I trowed not to sclau^der or moeue them to shame in my person. My god have
mercy upon me and will quycken me to the end yt I may learn the other. And in
this manner prayng three times the devout Relygyouse penytent / he was of god
exalted and herd / and had very knoweloge thereof by that he rose and came to
his lantern which he found brennynge full bright / wherefore reioysshyng him
self he was comforted with a hope / and wondered full sore of ye great grace ye
god had done to him pardo^nyng unto hy^ so benyngly his sin / and fullyng his
desire after his petyco^n and said I yield unto ye graces my lord and my god /
of yt it has pleases yt in this present world to have mercy of me poor
synnar and Indygne of thy great mysery cordye I gyuyng to all sinners by this
new token confyance and trust of ye self mercy and forgyuyng the miserable
souls yt you have created for to come to thy glory. In this manner perseueryng
this holy man in his confession and yeldyng graces and thanks unto our lord /
ye day came yt he took so great reioysshyng / yt he forgate him self to take
his repast and fode corporal. And all the days of his life he kept besyly
the light of the said lantern putty^g oil thereto when it neded and taking
good head yt it should not go out / and from hens forth ye holy ghost enhabyted
in hy^ / by ye help of which he profyted so / yt he was reputed and holden
for an holy man and of great reno^mee / and to who^ a little before his decesse
was showed ye day yt he should depart out of this world to ye royalme of
heaven.

An other treatise follows / wherein is contained that folk of Relygyon ought
not to possess nothing / and begins in latin (Frater quida^ etc)


A Young man sometime desiring to be a Relygyouse / forsook the world and gaaf
you yt he had to the poor / except some small goods that he reserved to
himself for his help and after came unto saint Anthonye requyryng hy^ that he
would receive him to the astate of Relygyon. Saint Anthony knowing yt which is
said / said unto hy^. If you wylt that I shall receive the to be a monk / you
must go to ye next cite here by / and that you bye flesh / and this done yt
shall make fast the said flesh to thy flesh naked / and then you shall come
to me again in that astate / and then I shall do that you desires of me. The
young man desyryng sore for to do that Saint Anthonye had charged him went
and bought flesh and fastened it at his bare flesh / as he had ordained
him to do. And gooyng again toward him the dogs and the birds followed him
which by grydynes and glotony to ete of the said flesh rented and knawed his
own skin in diverse places of his body. And thus he returned to Saint
Anthonye which seeing his skin thus turn and gnawen / he said to him that
in likewise are turn and gnawen by the fend of hell and by his temptacyons
/ they that forsakyng the world will withholde and possess their money or
other temporal goods. The abbot Danyell reherced of the holy fader Arsenye /
that a great offycer Romayne came ones to him / and brought him the testamente
of a Senator which was of kynne to the said Arsenyen / and that by this
testamente had made him his heir leuynge unto him many fair herytages and
great lyuelode. The holy fader Arsenye taking this testamente would have
broken it and rented in pieces / the which thing seeing the said offycer /
did cast him self down before him / besechyng him that he should not do
so / because that if he had not conne exhybe and show the same again there
as it apperteyned / he should have lost his head. Then the holy fader Arsenye
took it again to him / saying thus. Every body knows well that I am deed
long time agoo before him that has made this testamente / the which is but
late decessed / and how may he then have made me his heir / by the which
words he understood for to say / that from the time yt he gaaf himself to be
a monk or Relygyouse he did hold hy^ for deed as to the world / and that he
ought never to have nor appropre to hy^ self any thing worldly or temporal.
The said holy fader Arsenye was ones syke in Sychye / and had great need of a
little money for to releue hy^ from his sykenesse. So was he constrained to
ask it for gods sake / and receyuyng the same he said. Lord god I yield
unto ye graces of yt it has pleased the to make me worthy that in thy name and
for to forther and help my self out of my necessyte and Indygence I have
asked and received an almose.

Some reherce of the abbot Agathon that he and some of his monks and dyscyples
were long time about ye making of a celle for to make there their resydence
and place to dwell in. And after yt they had made an end of it and had
dwelled therein a while / the abbot Agathon saw some thing yt to his advise was
not prouffytable for hy^ and said to his Relygyouses / yt they should depart
from ye place and go with hy^ for to enhabyte an other / whereat they angry and
wroth answered such words or in substance. Ha fair fader if ye had before
determined in your courage for to depart from hens as ye now do show it / why
have ye made us bear and sustain so great pain and labors in edyfyeng this
celle whereat we have be so long / they yt shall see our departing thus sodayn
shall be sclau^dred in us / and shall blame us of the vice of inconstau^ce /
and shall mock us / sayng yt we can not abide in no place. The said holy fader
Agathon / seeing the said Relygyouse being wayllefull and dredefull / said to
them. My brethern ye wot not what ye say. For if there be some that will
speak evil by us / also shall there be some other that shall be edyfyed by the
same / and shall speak good of us / and they shall mow say / thoos be good
and devout relygyouses which for the love that they have had to god they are
departed and have haboundonned all their goods. And therefore who that will
come with me / let him come / for certainly I ensure you that I will depart.
Then they prosterned themself before his fete do^ne to the earth prayenge him
yt he would grant to them that they might bear him company whersoeuer he
would goo.

The abbot Euagrius said yt there was sometime a brother which had nor
possessed nothing saufe oonly a book of gospellys / the which nevertheless he
sold / and to the poor nedy he gaaf the money yt he received for it / sayng
a word which is dygne of memory / that is to wit / yt he had sold ye word
yt commanded that men should selle all yt they have and give it to the poor.
The abbot Theodore otherwise called the ferme / had three good books and veyle
to be read. So was he required of some Relygyouses to lene them his books.
Wherefore he went toward the abbot Macharye / and said to him such words or
semblable. My brother I come toward the / to the end yt you give me counsel. it
is troth yt I have in books wherein I read gladly / for in redyng therein me
seems yt I do my profit by it and nevertheless I am desired of certain
brethern to leave them unto them for to profit in likewise thereby / so wot I
not what I ought to do / wherefore if it please the you shall tell me thyn
advise / where at this Macharye answered / yt it was a good occupaco^n to read
holy scryptures and to employe hy^ to do good / but for a Relygyouse / the
gretest thing of all his works / is yt he shall not possess nothing / the
which answer herd he took his leave of ye said Macharye / and from that hour
he went and sold his books / and gaaf to the poor nedy the penys that he had
received for it.

One of the aeged faders reherced of the holy fader Johan which was of perse /
yt among his good works and virtues he was of deep symplenesse and innocencye.
He dwelling and making his resydence in Arabye which is nygh Egypt / he
borrowed ones one shelyng of a brother Relygyouse for to bye flocks for to
occupye himself with. And after that he had bought some / came to him a brother
/ prayng him yt he would give him a few of his flocks / for to make a
vestemente to his usage. And he gaaf it him gladly. An other came anon to him
yt desired hy^ for some of it for to make a couerlet / and he took it him.
Likewise came to him many other to whom he gaaf of it gladly. And syn after
came toward hy^ the Religyouse that had leued hy^ the shelyng whereof he had
bought the said flocks and prayed him that he would pay him again / to whom he
answered yt he should go his ways and that he should pay it him within a
short while. And because that he had no money to pay him / he went toward
the abbot James the dyspenser for to pray hy^ that he would lene or give him a
shelyng / but in his way thytherward he found ^o shelyng / which he touched
not / and syn made his oryson to god yt he would keep hy^ from evil
temptaco^n. And so done he went again to his celle / where the said Relygyouse
came to him again which asked his shelyng that he had lened him / and complained
over hy^ sore that he took it him not again. Then the good Johan said to him
prayng that he would have pacyence for a while / and he should have it shortly
again. So took he his way again toward yt said abbot James for to borowe of hy^
the said shelyng. And in his way he found yet the said shelyng in the said
place as he did before / wherefore without to touch it / he made his prayer to
god as he had done before / and returned again to his celle without to goo any
ferther And yet came toward him that other Relygyouse which was more worse
pleased with him than he was before / because he had not his shelynge. The holy
fader Johan sayng then to hy^ abide me yet a little / and I shall bring it
unto ye / departed on his way and came there as he had seen ye shelyng / and
seeing it yet still in ye self place where he had seen him before / he made his
prayer unto god / and syn he took it up and so went he forth toward the said
abbot James / to whom he said. Fair fader in my way hytherwarde I have found
this shelyng / if it be thy pleasure in showing thy charity you shall do to be
publysshed and known to all man / yt it is found for to wit if any body has
lost it And the abbot did so / and nevertheless no body came that challenged
it for his own / wherefore the holy fader Johan said to ye abbot James. Good
fader if no body has not lost it. I pray the that thou will take it to that
Relygyouse to whom I owe ^o shelynge / and you shall do to me a synguler
pleasure. For late I came toward the for to pray the that you sholdest lene me
one for him / and in my way I did find the same that I have taken unto the.
And then the abbot meruaylled full sore / how the said holy fader Johan /
seen that he was constrained to pay again the shelyng unto his credytour / had
borne it unto him straight way when he had found it. And yet of hy^ was
wonder said / that if any body came to him for to borowe any thing / he never
took it him himself / but said to him yt he should take what he would and bear
it with hy. And in likewise if men brought him any thing again that he had
lened to them / he never received it / but said to him yt brought it again /
that he should put it if it seemed hy^ good there as he took it before when he
borrowed it. And if they brought it not again / he complained not thereupon.

Some oldo faders recounten / that ones at a congregaco^n or assemble of
monks dwelling in diverse celles / among which was pryncypall yt abbot Ysaac
/ came a brother that had on a little scapulary which was over fyn and over
little. To whom the said abbot Ysaac said. Here is the habytacyon of monks /
and you a^t worldy as a seculer man / thou may not be here. And syn said to
the other brothen such words Our faders and the abbot Poule used of old
vestementes twyes sowed and patched in diverse places. And now ye use of
vestyme^tes precyouse that be not appropred to folk of Relygyon. And therefore
go away from hens / for ye deserte and dyffame this place. And when in time of
heruest they went for to repe corn for to get there their prouysyon for their
living. He said to them / that he gaaf them no commandments to keep /
because yt he knew well / that when he should give them any / they should not
keep them.

The abbot Cassyan said yt a Senator of Rome named Symelicius wyllyng to
forsake ye world / took his richesses and dystrybued them to poor folk for
gods sake / sauffe some things yt he kept for his own use / not wyllyng
perfytly in all things receyuyng ye humylyte of ye forsakers nor the rule of
ye life in common of them yt lived in ye monasteryes. To whom ye holy fader
Basylle a man of holy memory had said in this wise. Thou have left to be a
Senator in Rome / but nethelesse you have not made thyself a very relygyouse.
A brother said to ye abbot Pyscamode that it was a thing yt grieved him / for to
selle that that he made by labor of his own hands / and at this cause he
asked him what he should do with the works that he made. The which abbot
answered unto him / that the holy fader Sysoyns and the other aeged faders were
wont to selle the works yt they made with their hands / and that this grieved
nor let them not in no manner of wise. And more over he said to hy^ / if he
would not selle them that he might well say the price of every thing wrought
that he delivered and if he would deducte or abate any thing thereof / he might
do it. And thus he should mow find in selling ye peace of his conscience.
This brother asked him again / if by any other mean than for to work and
labor he might have his necessytees suffysauntly / he would wit if it was
need that he should work / whereat the old fader answered unto him / that how
well that he had suffysauntly to live upon without to labor / so ought he not
for that to be idle / but ought ever to be occupied about somewhat whereof good
might proceed.

A brother questyoned the abbot Serapyon sayng that he should tell him a word
oonly of his mouth. Serapion answered to hy / and what have I to tell the / you
have born away ye things that longed to wydowes and orphans and has laid
them in a wyndowe. And this he said because he had seen that wyndowe full of
books.

Saint Syncletyce was ones asked if naught to have was a good so parfytte as
men said / whereunto she answered / that it was a parfytte good to thoos that
might be content of naught to possess. And morouer she said that they that
might live in this astate having pacyence with ye same / how well that they
had bodily troubles / always they should possess the rest and peace of their
souls. For like as ye strong raymentes when the foller fulleth them and
tourmenteth them often under his fete. In this dooyng they be washed and wex
white. Likewise the soul that is strong and constaunt thrughe voluntary
pouerte is confermed in perfeccyon of virtues.

The abbot Ypericius said that wylfull pouerte was the very tresore of a monk
or relygyouse. And to this purpose he excyted the brethern to the tresore in
heaven / saying that it was the world perpetuell where ye good ought to rest
with on end.

Among the other holy faders dwelling in Iherusalem there was one named
Phylagrius ye labored / to the end that oonly in labouryng he should lake no
bread for to sustain his body withal. Ones among other he being in the
common place where he would have sold the works that he had made with his
hands / a certain person let fall by a hap a little sack wherein were a
thousand shelynges / which this old fader Phylagrius found and took up and
nethelesse he departed not fro the place where he had found it / but held him
there / sayng in him self that he that had lost them ought necessaryly to
come there for to find it again. And anon after he that had lost this little
sack came there for to seek after it. the which the said holy fader did call
unto him a side and took it again unto him with all that was in. And he that had
lost it prayed the holy fader yt he would take a part of the money but he
would not thereof. Then that other began to cry and say openly how this holy
fader had found his sack / and had delivered it unto hy^ again without to take
any thing of it. The holy man heryng these words fled pryuely away from among
ye people and issued out of ye cite to the end that he should not be known and
honored of that he had done.

An other old fader was questyoned of a young brother for to wit of him what
thing he ought to do for to be saved. Then the holy fader dyspoyled hy^ self
from his own vestyment / and gyrded well his raynes / and syn said stretchyng
his arms and hands abroad / yt in this manner a monk ought to be naked from
all seculer matters / and to crucyfye him self against the temptacyons and
worldly thoughts.

A brother Relygyouse prayed an aged holy fader yt he wole agreably receive of
hy^ certain so^me of money yt he would give hy^ for to help hy^ self at his
need but he would not receive it / because yt ye works yt he made with his
hands were suffysau^t for the entreatenyng of his live. The said brother
persystyng in his request / prayed hy^ more than before yt if he would not
receive yt so^me of money for an aid to his aflaytes / at the less yt he
would receive ye same for to be by hy^ dystrybued to poor folk / whereat ye
holy fader answered hy^ / yt this were to hy^ opprobre and double sin to
receive it / ye one because yt in receyuyng the same money for hy^ / he should
do so without necessyte / and ye other yt in dealyng it to poor folk he
should mow fall in to the sin of vain glory.

Some greeks tra^sported ones them self in to ye cite of Ostrace for to deal
there certain almoses / and for to do ye same they called unto them ye general
procuratours of the church / to the end that they should learn and show to them
thoos yt were more nedy. So they arrected and led them to a poor lazer / to
whom they gave an almose / but he would not take it sayng yt he had no need of
it in asmoche yt he could get somewhat for his life to be sustained with / in
maky^g of mattes of rodes and palm which he wrought with his hands / whereof
he took silver for to bye bread co^petently for his living / and after they
went from this lazer and led ye said greeks to the house of a poor wydowe
which was a lauender and a wassher of lynen clothes yt had many poor childern
/ and where they knocked at her door / came there one of her daughter yt was so
evil clothed and poorly arrayed / yt her flesh was seen bare and naked in
diverse places which told them yt her mother was not with in. The greeks seeing
ye Indygence and pouerte of this wydowe and of her childern / and namely for
pity yt they had of this poor maid yt to ye door came / they gave her a gown
and money which she would not take / sayng yt her mother had told her yt she
should set her trust in god / and that he would yt they should have their
living in ye manner as they had it / and that morouer for ye day she had found
work enough / whereof they might easily live and pass forth ye day / and in
sayng these words came home this wydowe the mother of this maid / to whom they
prayed to take this almose which her dought had refused / but she would not /
sayng that she had god which was her procuratour and he that oonly had the
cure and the charge of her and of all her childern. And more over she said to
them / that they would take him away from her. Then they knowing her great
faith gloryfyed and thanked our lord.

A venerable man unknown transported himself ones in the dysertes of Sychye
beryng there with him great quantyte of gold and of silver / and prayed the
sovereign fader abbot of the hermytages / yt he should deal this quantyte of
gold and silver unto the brethern of thoos hermytages / yt which answered to
hy^ / yt the brethern had no need. And where he did pray him many times to do
ye same / seeing that he would not grant hy^ his request. He set a corffe
before the gate of the church and therein a great some of money to the sight
of every one. The which thing seeing the said fader abbot / he said unto all
in general yt if any among them had need of money yt they should take of it
out of the said corffe / but there was not one yt touched it nor yt looked ones
upon the corffe. And after the holy fader abbot said to the said almener. My
friend ye ought to be content / for god has received agreably your oblacyon /
go then your ways and deal it to the poor. The which words herd he
departed wounderfully edyfyed of their well ruled suffysau^ce.

An other offered unto an old holy fader which was a lazer certain sum of
money / sayng to him that he should take it for to help hy^self withal /
sayng that he had well need of it / his old aege and maladye well considered.
The poor syke answered to him. Alas my friend it is three score year ago that
god of his benygnyte has ever nourysshed me / and now thou wylt take him
away from me. Syn that time that I have be syke as I am. I have not had no
pouerte nor Indygence. For my god has always fed me / therefore I pray the
that thou wylt be content of me like as that I had taken thyn almose. For
certainly I will not have it.

Some ancient holy faders recyted of a good man that was a gardener and soore
laboryouse. And all that he could get with his labor he spend it all in
almoses / and would never reserve to his own behouffe any thing thereof / but
oonly asmoche as suffysed to bye with his bread cotydyan The devil of hell
enmye of humayne nature seeing the great and parfytte charity of this poor
gardener / and enuyous of ye merit yt he acquyred in making the said almoses
tempted hy^ subtylly for to make him to leave or to mynusshe these almoses yt he
made / gyuyng to hy^ to understand / yt he began to come in to age / and yt he
might well hap to fall in some sykenes or debylytaco^n of his body / through
ye which he should fall in great pouerte / seeing namely yt where he might no
more work nor labor / he should have nothing to help hy^self with at his
need. So thought he in himself to spare and set aside some money / and in
deed he spared so much yt he filled a boteylle with money. It happed after
this yt he fell in a malady because of one of his fete which was all Infected
and rotyn. And for to puruey and remedy to this sykenes he made some medicines
and cyrurgyens to look to his foot / ye which this dooyng / and gyuyng unto
hy^ diverse manners of oynementes consumed and wasted all his money that he had
spared And nevertheless they could not give him no remedy. And fynably a
right expert master in cyrugye came to see him / ye said unto him / if he
made not his foot to be cut of / hit should poysone and infecte all his body
/ wherefore on even was delyberaco^n taken to do and accomplysshe the same. And
ye same this poor man thynkyng upon his befall / and knowing ye fawte yt he
had co^mysed and done in leuyng his almoses to be do by hy^ as he was wont /
for to spare ye money which was already inutylly spend / began for to weep
and sygh^ full sore / repentyng hy^self yt he had so offended god and the
poores / and began to say thus. O my god I beseech unto thy benygne bou^te yt
you will not take heed upon my great ingratytude toward the / but please yt to
have remembrance of the little almoses yt I have done for thy sake in time
passed ye time yt I did labor in my gardyn / and whereof I did feed thy poor
servants. And sayng the same the angel of god descended before hy^ which
said to him. Come hither good man I pray the tell me where ye hope yt you
had in thy money is now which so curyously you had spared and kept The good
man herkenyng after these words answered. Alas sire I have syned pardo^ne it
me / and from hensfortho^ I shall no more do so. Then ye angel of our lord
touched his foot which was anon hole / and redyly he stood up / and went to
labor in his gardyn as he was wont to do. He being in his gardyn the
cyrurgyen came to ye house of this good man bryngyng with hy^ his yrons and
instruments for to have cut of his foot with / but men told hy^ yt he was
risen in the morning erly and was gone for to work and labor his gardyn. The
which thing herd / and beleuy^g the same the said cyrurgyen / he went
toward the poor man which he found deluyng yt earth his fete over ye spade.
And seeing in hy^ the troth of yt was told him / and the great socours yt our
lord had given to hy^ / he began to gloryfye and to praise the dyuyne puyssance.

A Relygyouse questyoned an aeged holy fader askyng of him if he would well yt
he should hold and keep toward hy^ the value of two shelyng for to help and
socour to himself against syknes if any happed to come upon hy^. The old fader
knowing the affecco^n yt the said Relygyouse had to reserve and keep this two
shelyng / said yt he would well yt he should do so. Then this Relygyouse
returned to his celle and thynkyng upon the answer yt the old fader had done
to hy^ came unto hy^ diverse cogytaco^ns and thought ye tormented hy^ all his
courage and said to himself / wenest you miserable man yt the old fader has
told ye troth certeynly I can not say whether he said it in ernest or no /
and in effect for to pease his courage / he departed again out of his celle and
went again toward him repentyng himself and said to him. Good fader I pray yt
in the name of god yt it will please the to tell me troth touching yt ye I
have asked to the / yt is to wit if I should keep my two shelyng or no for to
aid to my necessyte / for I find me sore tourmen^ed of thought and
cogytaco^ns which come to me because of the same whereat ye old holy fader
answered to hy^. Certes my brother because I did see the will yt you had for
to keep them to the ward. I did tell the yt you sholdest keep them / but
nevertheless I will well that thou know / that it is not well done to keep or
withholde toward him self more than it needs for the body / and if you
withholdest these two shelynge / doubt not but yt thy hope shall be set
thereupon. And if by adventure they be lost / syn that thy hope was turned
thereupon / god shall no more have a cause to remember and think upon the. And
therefore we ought to fix and turn all our hope and thought oonly in god / and
thus dooyng he shall see that we shall be helped and socoured in our affairs
and necessytees.

An other little treatise herafter consequently follows of the virtue of force
and of pacyence / and it begins in latin (Sanctus abbas Anthonius etc)


Saint Anthonye the abbot he being in his hermytage was meruayllously vexed and
his courage sore perturbed and confuse by the occasyon of diverse thoughts and
cogytacions ye came over him / and began to say to our lord. Alas sire I would
feign be saved / but the diverse thoughts and fantasyes which come me over /
letten me totally from the gettyng of my saluaco^n. Alas sire what ought I to
do in this trybulaco^n / or how shall I mow save my self. And after he
issued out of his celle and saw a man yt satte and wrought / which anon
after rose and cessed his labors and set himself to pray and make oraco^n
unto god / and then after he went again to his work and took labor to hand
maky^g mattes or mau^des and soon after went to oryson again as he did before.
It is to wit yt this man was an angel yt had turned hy^ self in that form
of a man / and the which had be sent from our lord unto saint Anthonye for
his correcco^n / and for to give hy^ a good cautele and away for to resyst
against the temptaco^ns of ye devil. So herd he ye voice of this angel ye
said unto hy^. Anthonye work and labor as I do / and you shall be saved Saint
Anthony heryng these words was much reioysshed taking in this vysyon a very
hope of his saluaco^n / and he began to do as he had seen ye angel do / and
thus doing he found ye salute yt he sought. A relygyous said to the abbot
Agathon yt he had be sent for / for to come to a place yt was not unto him
well agreeable / because he hoped not to be there without battle nor in peace of
his conscience / but nethelesse he was purposed to go theder for to obey to yt
was to hy^ commanded / how be it yt he fered and redoubted sore to go the^ for
ye cause abouesaid The abbot Ammoras said that he had dwelled.xiiij. year in ye
deserts of Sychye prayng god there night and day ye pry^cypally he should give
hy^ virtue and strength for to overcome ye passions of ire The abbot Besaryon
said / that he had soyourned by.xl. days among the thorns without sleep.

An other solytary brother yt was in his works sore synguler was because of ye
same oftentimes in his courage / wherefore he went toward ye abbot Theodore
called ye ferme / and told hy^ how he was thus sore troubled often. To whom he
said. My sone you must humble thy courage and put thyselfe under ye other
brethern / and thus you shall mow in likewise dwell with them. This Relygyous
went inco^tynent to ye montayne / and dwelled there with ye other a certain
while / and then he came again toward ye said abbot Theodore / and said to hy^
yt in co^uersau^t with the men / he could not find there no rest / whereat the
holy fader answered if you can not have peace by thyself alone nor with ye
relygyouses / why have you made thyselfe a monk. Have not you done so for to
bear and sustain trybulaco^n I pray yt tell me how long you have borne ye
habyte of a relygyon. And he answered unto hy^ that during.viij. year he had
borne it. Then said to him the holy fader. Bylyue me of yt I shall tell the.
I have lived.lxx. year in relygyon / but I found never a day there of rest /
and you wylt have it in.viij. year that you have be there.

An other brother moeued ye said abbot Theodore askyng to hy^ / if it was a sure
thing to dwell in a place where an other was fall suddenly. And he answered
unto him. If heaven were in a danger to fall done so that it should touch ye
earth / yet should not Theodore be aferde of it. The which questyon the said
Relygyous did moeue unto him / desyryng to wit what he should answer unto
hy^ thereupon / because yt namely he had herd say / yt this Theodore had
prayed to god / yt he should take away from hy^ dread and doubt seruyle from
his courage.

Some said of the abbot Theodore of saint Lucye and of a Nonne of Alexa^drye /
that during fyfty years they made in their celles contynuall resydence without
to have ones departed out of ye same / reducyng in to memory yt great and
meruayllous constau^ce of their old faders yt had be thus constau^t. And when
any fantasyes or cogytacyons came to them upon for to go or tra^sporte them
self in to some strange places / they concluded together for to go there
saying in this manner. When ye winter is passed we shall go to such a place /
and coming the somer in hand / they said / when ye somer shall be almoost at
an end we shall go to such a place. And thus from year to year and from term
to term they prolonged their such delyberaco^ns / so long that they dwelled
still in their said habytacyons as constaunt and ferme during the time of fyfty
years as above is said.

The abbot Pastor said of yt abbot Johan ye little / yt he had prayed god yt he
would take away from him all his sensual passions / in such wise yt he were
sure yt he should never do no sin. And having this ymagynaco^n / ye god had
granted hy^ his prayer / he said to an old relygyous that he found hy^self
peasyble in his courage / and not having within him no repynyng or bataylle.
Then this old Relygyous said unto hy^. I counsel the yt you go pray god /
that he will make thy passions to be moeued in the. For to have matter to fight
with them resystyng there against For in this doing ye soul prouffyteth. The
which prayer the said abbot Johan made. And when he saw himself thus
assaylled as before / he prayed no more god yt he should take from hy^ his said
passions / but prayed hy^ oonly yt he would give him the virtue of force and of
constau^ce / for to sustain them and resyste to the same.

The abbot Macharye ye great transported ones hyselfe to the montayne toward
the abbot saint Anthonye / and knockyng at his door / saint Anthonye came yt
made him openyng and asked to ye said Macharye what he was / whereat he answered
yt he was Macharye / the which answer herd saint Anthonye entered again within
his celle / and as by despyte / he shetted his door again before his face / and
left the said Macharye without. And syn after saint Anthony seeing yt pacyence
of this Macharye he opened his door again to hy^ and made hy^ good chere sayng.
Ha my brother you art welcome. It is long agoon that I had great desire to see
the / for the good and laudable report yt I have had ever of thy virtuous
condyco^ns. And after that they had talked and devised togydre / the said saint
Anthonye admynystred unto hy^ of his goods entreatyng hy^ amyably / and making
unto hy^ all the seruyces of hospytalyte to hy^ possible. For the said Saint
Macharye because of the long way yt he had done he was sore trauaylled and
weary. And then coming the even toward / saint Anthonye which was never
idle did lay his rods and palms in water for to wete them that he might
work withal about his baskettes and maundes. And saint Macharye prayed him
that he would delyuere to him moo rods for to water for to put to work as he
had done. But saint Anthonye desyryng that he should rest / answered to him yt
he had no moo. And nevertheless he made for hy^ a greter ferdell or bondell
the which he watered for to put to work. And thus in spekyng of the health. of
their souls / they began to work for to tyssue the said rods and palms to
make mattes / the which so made / they let down by a wyndowe in to a deep
pytte. The morn following saint Anthonye descended and went down in to the
pytte / saw and beheld ye great multitude of mattes which saint Macharye had
made / he meruaylled strongly and after went and kyssed the hondes of saint
Macharye / in saying that out of his hands came great virtue. On a time the
said saint Macharye went down fro yt deserts of Sychye in to a place called
Therenutin / in which place he was surprysyd with sleep / and was constrained
to sleep in a sepulture where of old time had be acustomed for to burye the
bodies of paynems. And for to rest him he leyde his head upon a deed body / as
it had been a pylowe or quysshon. The deuyls then seeing the great affyau^ce
that he had in god / were sore troubled / and wyllyng to fere and make the said
saint Machary a gaste One of them began to call a woman sayneg. Nonne come and
bayne the with us. In answeryng to whom an other devil which had entered in to
the body upon which saint Macharye rested / and lay upon it with his head /
said to the devil that called him. I may not / for I have a pilgrim upon me
/ which lets me to go thither. The holy man Macharye heryng these words was
nothing affrayed / but trustyng verily always in god said to the deed corpse.
Arise thou and goo forth if thou may. The which answered heryng the deuylles
began to cry with an hye voys saying Ha Macharye thou have vaynquysshed and
overcome us. And these words said / they fled away all confused.

The abbot Mathoys said / when I will do any thing lightly / anon I think
how gryeuous it is / and anon it flees away from me and is fynysshed.

Some reherce of the abbot Mylet / how he dwelling and making resydence in the
deserts of per^e two childern of the Emperor of the Persyens on a time among
other as they had be accustomed / went for to hunte and for to take some best
more lightly / did do hang there their cords and nets a broad which
comprysed.xl. mesures in length and bread. And in huntyng in the said place /
the holy fader saint Macharye with his two dyscyples being nygh by the cord
was there fou^den by the said chyldern and their people the which seeing the
said saint Macharye to be meruayllously rowgh / and had a face terryble and
ferdfull to behold / werof the sight of hy^ meruayllously abashed / and began
to ask and demand of him if he were a man or some espyryte. To whom he
answerde that he was a sinful man which byleued on the sone of god the which
had received death on the cross and passion for the salvation of mankind / and
him worshypped with all affection / as to him oonly to whom was due adoracyon
and honor. And heryng his answer they said that they wyste not what he said /
and that they had none other gods but the son / the fire / and the water /
and that it byhoued that they adoured them / and should make to them
sacrefyce. Saint Macharye answered to them that he never should so do / by
cause that the son was a planete / and the fire and water two clementes /
which had no puyssau^ce ne power but such as was given to them at their
creacyon of god their maker. And by this and other reasons Saint Macharye
showed to them that they erred meruayllously Wherefore he admonested them to
convert them to god which had created them and all other things. The same
childern and their folk heryng these words of saint Macharye began to mock
him in saying. Say thou not that thy god has been crucyfyed / yes said saint
Macharye. And yet I say more / that it is he which by his death mortefyeth
sin and sleeth eternal death. After the which words so said / they did to
Saint Macharye and to his dyscyples many torments wyllyng to constrayne hem to
make sacrefyce to the son / to the fire / and to the water / as to their
gods / which they utterly refused and would not do it. For which cause
after diverse tourmentes they smote of the hedes of the two dyscyples of saint
Macharye / but they would not so promptly put him to death by cause they
would put him to more tourmentes and so they did. And among other they set
him in the myddle of a place where they establysshed to shote at him / as he
had be a butte. And they shot many arowes / some in his back and other in
his breast. In suffryng the said tourmente saint Macharye said to the two
childern. False and untrue tyrauntes Inhumayne / for as much as I see that of
one accord and consentement ye be determined to shede thynnocent blood / and
to put to death myserably the poor servants of god. I will aduertyse you
and notefye / that to morn at this hour your mother shall be without childern /
and shall be pryued fro the sight of you / and that ye shall more hurt and
gryeue your self / and shall with your arowes shede your own blood to gydre.
The said childern dyspysyng the words of the said saint Macharye and mocked
him. On the morn they went on hunting as they did to forn / And it happed
that an heart was taken in their cords / the which notwithstondyng escaped.
Then they rode after with all dylygence to the end that they might take him /
and in shotyng their arowes against him they slew each other / like as saint
Macharye had said to them.

The abbot Pastor said that a Relygyous man is verily known to be a monk in
his temptacyons / that is to wit when he resysteth them constantly and
myghtyly. Yet said the said abbot being in Sychye on a time to his relygyouses.
My brethern ye know well that we be hither come for to labor. Now I see well
that here is no manner labor / wherefore I determyne that we goo to some other
place / where we may find to labor / to the end that in so dooyng we may
find rest as who would say / that the grettest battle that a relygyous man
may mean against him self / is to be idle. For in werkyng many evil thoughts
and cogytacyons ben eschewed.

Saint Syncletyce said in spekyng to his monks / if ye converse in the
monasterye with the other / change not you^ ^ace / for ye destroy your self
if ye so do. And in like wise as an hen if she leave her eggs without to
couere them / she shall never have chykens / for they may not be formed for
lack of hete. Right so in likewise the relygyous man or woman that
transporteth him self from one place to an other / in leuyng the place of his
Relygyon shall never fructefye in virtuous works. For he or she is all cold
in the virtue of faith for as much as he transporteth and changes his own
place. Ferthermore he said / that when the devil may not make to fall in to
sin a Relygyous person or other by the pryckynges of pouerte / he
admynystreth to him habundau^ce of Richesses for to make him sin by the moen
of them. And in like wise / when he may not excyte him by Iniuryes and
repreues / he makes to be mynystred to him praysynges and vain glory. And
there where he procures to a person that he have all the cases of his body /
and may not begyle and seduce him by delectacyons and worldly pleasaunces.
Then he enforces him to make him fall by aduersytees and molestacyons
which he makes to come contrary to his will. And often to them that he will
te^pte / he makes to come upon them some sekenesses and maladyes / by the
which he makes the Relygyouses ferdfull / and troubles in them the charity
that they have toward god / But how well that the body be tourmented by hot
feures enflamed with thrust Insacyable / he that such afflyccyons susteyneth
and endures ought to have in his remembraun^^ and mind the eternal fire /
and the unspeakable tourmentes of hell / And in consyderyng them well he shall
not be slow ne feeble to suffer the aduersytees of this world but shall bear
them with great courage in him self / enioyeng of that which our lord by
such aduersytees vysyteth him / in having in his mouth the words of Dauyd in
the psaulter which ben these. My god which chastyseth his sinners / has by
his grace chastysed me / and has not condemned me to death. And if the
Relygyous thus tourmented be a sinner and in ruste as the iron / he shall lose
his ruste by the fyte of aduersyte. And if he be Just beryng his maladyes and
aduersytees pacyently fro great perfeccyon / he shall be promoted to more
gretter. And if he be steadfast / he shall be puryfyed to the confusyon of the
devil / which is given to a man for to tempte him with ye pryckynges of his
flesh. Then he ought to enjoy him / in consyderyng to whom he is made
semblable. For if he be tempted with flesshely concupyscence / and if he
withstand it constantly / he shall have merit / and deserve like to the
merit of Saint Poull the Appostle. If we be chastysed by hot feures / or by
rygour of cold / we ought to have Remembrance of the scripture that says /
we have passed by fire and water. And there rests no thing / but that we be
put in a place of rest / we ought also to hope sith that we have born the
tourmentes / that we shall have after consolacyons and comfort Also in making
and dooyng virtuous works we ought to cry with the prophet Dauyd in saying.
I am poor / nedy / and sorrowful. And he that pacyently shall suffer such
trybulacyous. Infallybly he shall be in sovereign degree of perfeccyon. Then
in these excersyces let us prove our works in fyghtyng constantly against our
enemy / whom we have contynuelly tofore our eyes. And if the maladye be to us
gryeuous / therefore late us not be angry / but notwithstanding the sickness or
hurt bodily late us take heed to pray to god and thank him. Certain all
things be to us necessary for to destroy and bring to naught the bodily
dyseases. And fastings and labors ben to us ordained against the soul
thoughts and temptacyons. If then our sekenesses break and bruise our vycyous
affeccyons and superflue / we ought to pray god that they abide and continue
in us for our amendment and correcco^n / and that he give to us courage and
affection to bear and suffer them pacyently. Certainly like as by great and
sharp medycyne a sekenes is heled. Right so by maladyes of the body ben cut
of and withdrawn the bodily vices. And it is a great virtue when in gryeuous
maladyes / one has humble pacyence. And by so dooyng and gyuynge to god
thankynges / the said pacyente is redyly addressyd and sent to god / if we
lose our bodily eyes / we ought not take it gryeuously / but we ought to endure
it pacyently. For belesyng of them / we lose the Instrumente which may make
us to enhaunce in pride. And in contrary wise / by the eyes of our
entendemente and understanding / we may the more lightly behold and have
contemplacyon in the glory of our lord / if we have lost our heryng and be
deef / we retche not / for thereby we have lost the opportunyte of heryng or to
herkene vain words. If our bodily hondes have any passion / or by sekenesses
be enfebled / we ought to have our spyrytuell hondes more ready to virtuous
works / if the sickness enfeblyssheth our body in so dooyng if it be
vycyous / it dysposeth him to withstand the temptacyons of the fend. And if
he be virtuous / his virtue and health encreaceth. They that in this world
commyse and do any crime or trespa^s openly / when they be taken they be will
they or not put and set in prison for to be punysshed of their misdeeds /
the which punycyon / if they bear it pacyently may be cause of their
salvation. We then that have done and commysed many horrible and great sins
toward our god and maker / which with his precyouse blood has redeemed us /
and that by cause of the said sins we ben in danger to run in to
dampnacyon eternal / we ought for to eschew the same with good will to
enprysone us and to punysshe and to correct our self / consyderyng that in
so doing we may get the glory eternal / and to eschew the horrible
tourmentes of hell / which ever shall suffer the miserable sinners that deyen
in dedely sin / when we fast we ought not to seek occasyon to say that the
fasting has so much enfebled us that we have run thereby in to some
maladye. For often times it happeth that they that fast not run in to such
and like sekenesses as well as they that fast / if we have begone to do some
good / we ought never to leave it without to fulfylle it / what someuer lettyng
the fend gives us. For by our pacyence he shall be destroyed. And for to
persevere with constaunt courage to withstand his temptacyons we ought to rule
us by example of the maronners / the which in dysposyng them to sail if they
have wind that to them be propyce. Incontynente they reyse up their saylles /
and put them to the voyage. But if that in their sayllyng come unto them any
wind contrary / for all that they forsake not suddenly their ship / but
suffer a little against the tempeste. And repugne to their power against it unto
the time that they find the time well dysposed to perform surely and lyghtely
their voyage. We then that be recountred and foughten with / by the wicked
and dampened spyryte. Address we in our courage the precious cross of our
savior Ihesu Christ instead of the saylle. And with out any danger or peril
we shall ouersaylle the peryllous and miserable see of this world.

Some recyten of a virgyne named Sayre the which was reputed of holy and
praised Remembrance / the which dwelled by the space of sixty year upon the
ryuage of a River / during the which time she never lift up her sight for to
be seen.

The abbot Yperycius said that we should always sing and have in our mouth
ympnes and spyrytuell songs / in thinking contynuelly on god and in his
meruayllous works. For by such cogytacyons and thynkynges is aswaged and
alleged the great heaviness and burden of temptacyons that comen on us / of
the which thing we have an euydent example.

A man long gooyng and trauayllynge wereth weary / but in blowynge and taking
his bre^h dymynyssheth somewhat his trauayll / and the great charge of his way.

The abbot Yperycius said / that it is of necessyte that we be armed against the
temptacyons of the devil / for they come in many manners / and in withstandyng
them when they assaylle us we shall be by the said resystau^ce be approved
constau^t and ferme.

An old ancient fader said / that if upon a man comes a temptacyon / and he
withstand it not constantly / then shall other temptacyons assaylle him on
all parts / which the fend his enemy shall mynystre to him / and make him
dredefull and to murmr against god. To this purpose is reherced an example.

A brother being in his celle which was tempted of a temptacyon / and desyryng
to withstand the same / if any sal^wed or grette him / doubtyng to re^ne in to
sin if he spoke to any person / he would not salowe him / ne receive him in
to his celle. And by cause of his great solycytude and straytenesse he was so
estraunged from other that some time / if he had need of bread / men gaaf him
none. And as men came from heruest / no man bad him to ete / how well that he
had be accustomed to be boden of them that came. And also in the time of
heruest which is an hot season he could not so much repe and labor / that
in the end he could have any bread in his celle. But what someuer necessyte
that he had he rendered always thankynges unto god / and had always a constaunt
and strong courage to supporte the necessytees and aduersytees / wherefore our
lord seeing the great pacyence of this holy man took away from him the
battle of temptacyons / for in socouryng him in his necessytees. Of a time
among the other / he sent to him a man / which knocked at his door / and
brought to him a great quantyte of bread upon a Camele coming fro Egypt. The
which thing seeing the holy fader / began to weep saying. Ha my god I see
well by the goods that over largely thou sendest to me / that I am not worthy
to bear the trybulacyons which thou sendest to thy seruytours. And when his
trybulacyons and aduersytees were passed / his brethern in their celles and in
the chirce received him / byddyng him for to rest with them. But for all that
he moeued not much / but said that neither for aduersyte ne prosperyte / one
ought not to enhaunce himself / ne also yield him feyntfully. For none knows
when ne how long thaduersytee or the prosperyte shall endure. And ought not to
defer any good work when it is begone / but enforce him tachyeue it / and
to be virtuous / and not think that it be labor or pain temploye him self
to get virtue.

An other Relygyous brother demanded an ancient fader saying. Fair fader what
ought I to do with my vain cogytacyons and thoughts / which oonly one hour
suffer me not to be in rest in my celle. To whom the ancient fader answered.
My sone I counseyll the / that thou return to withstand the temptacyons
which shall come upon the / and take labor on the / and excercyse thy body
in some handy work / and with that thou pray god Incenssauntly / in fixynge
and leyeng on him thy thought / in manner that none seduce the to issue out of
thy celle. And to this purpose he reherced how that there was a young seculer
child desyryng affectuously to be a Relygyous. And as he required and prayed
his fader humbly / that it pleased him to suffer and let him enter in to
relygyon. His fader would not enclyne to his Request. But fynably after that
many of his kynnesmen and friends that knew thaffeccyon of the child / he was
so sore pressyd and required that he consented thereto. Then the child
renounced all worldly things / and put him self in a monastery in which he
made himself relygyous And yt done he began perfyghtly to do all that was
requysyte and ye ought to do a virtuous man being in relygyon / as to fast and
do many other abstynences And in effect he absteyned to ete two hole days in
the weke / and in the other days he ete but ones oonly. The which abstynences
seeing his abbot / meruaylled greatly of his great virtues / and praised and
thanked humbly our lord. Always after a certain time / the said relygyous man
desyryng to live more solytaryly than he did among ye other Relygyouses /
required and prayed his abbot that he would give him license to go dwell in
deserte in an hermytage. To whom the abbot answered. A my child think not at
that / for you may not bear ne sustain the temptaco^ns of the devil / ne the
great labors that behooves a man to have in living solytaryly. Remembryng also
thy young age / you shall not mow here the frauds malyces and decepcyons of
the devil of hell. And that werse is if thou be in deserte by him assailed or
tempted of any evil temptacyons / thou shall not find about the ne night to
the any that may give to the any comfort or consolacyon. The Relygyous young
man heryng these remonstrances. And notwithstondyng them / he Required his
abbot more Instauntly than to fore that he would let him go And the abbot
seeing that he might not reteyne him / he prayed to our lord Ihesu christ for
him / and gaaf to him leave. After this he prayed thabbot that it might please
him to depute some of his monks that could show to him the way. And how
walkyng he ought to conduyte him self. The abbot according to his Request
assygned to him two monks which went with him. And after that they by
certain Iourneys walked through the deserts / they became weary and trauaylled
by the occasyon of the great hete / and were constrained to lie on the ground
/ and for great watch they slept a little They thus slepyng came to them an
Eygle which smote them with his wings. And that done he fled a little
tofore them and tarried on the ground. The two Relygyous monks which
conduyted the young brother being awaked by the touching of the said Eygle /
said that he should arise and showed to him the same eygle / and told to him
that it was an angel / desyryng that he should goo and follow after him. The
which anon aroos and flewe a quarter of a mile tofore the relygyous brother
and after rested on the ground. And the young monk by his eye followed after
so much that he came to him / the which of fleeyng / and walkyng after
continued by the space of three hours / the which passed / the Eygle flewe
away on the right hand of the Relygyous which followed him / and returned
after toward him. But nevertheless he followed him so long that he might
aperceyue him. And after that he had lost the sight of him / lokyng tofore him
he saw three trees of palm / and a well by them / where nyghe by was a
little cave or hole. Then he said to him self / that it was a place / which
our lord had prepared for him to live in solytaryly. And after entered in to
the cave / and concluded in him self to make resydence. In the which he
continued six year entyerly / without seeing of any person. And without etyng
of any other mete or drink / but dates and water of the said well. But the
devil enuyous of his devout and virtuous life / and desyryng to turn him to
dampnacyon / came to him in likeness of an aged fader having a dreadful and
stern vysage / whom seeing the young Relygyous man was gretely abashed / and
recommaunded him self unto god and aroos for to come to him. The devil for to
deceive him said. Brother I pray the / let us first make our prayers unto god
/ and after prayer so made by the said relygyous. The devil in arysyng asked
him how long he had be in yt place soyournyng. To whom the relygyous man
answerde yt he had be there.vi. year. I meruayll said the devil / how it may
be yt thus long time I have not known yt you were my neighbor / but within
four days hytherward yt to me is comen in mine ymagynacion / that there was
some holy man dwelling nyghe by me. And so I concluded to search and to come to
yt for to deuyse and talk with the for ye health of my soul. And this I tell
to the my brother / that we prouffyte nothing holdyng us in our celles and
caves. For we live as bestes / and receive not the body of our lord Ihesu christ
/ wherefore I doubt and fere strongly but yt we be astrau^ged from hy^ yt so
long absteyne us fro the holy sacrament. But I shall tell the what I think my
brother. There is from hens about a two mile a monasterye / wherein ben many
prestes whom we may go see every weke ones / or in.xv. days / and there we
shall receive ye worthy body of our lord Ihu^ christ / and ye done we may
return in to our celles. This deuyllysshe suasyon was agreeable to ye
relygyous yongman And ye sunday comen / the devil came again to hy^ saying yt
they should go to the said monastery / and yt it was time to depart / and so
they went forth. And in gooyng ye fond a relygyous man of ye said monasterye.
After yt ye young man had made his prayer in yt place / he arose and lokyng
about hy^ he fond not hy^ yt was come with hy^ / ye which was vanysshed
away. And thought in hy^self yt he was goon out of ye monastery for some
necessyte / and he abode for hy^ long and seeing yt he came not / he went
making dylygence to find hy^. And after inquired of the monks after him in
askyng them / if they had seen any old fader comen in to the church / the
which relygyous men answered to hy^ that they had seen none but hy^ oonly.
Then the young religyous man knew well that it was the devil / and began to
say in him self. Loo by what subtylte and malice the devil has made me to
go out of my cell / but nevertheless I set not much thereby. For I am comen
hither for to do and accomplysshe a good work / that is to wit for to receive
the precious body of my savior Ihesu christ / whom I shall receive if it
please him / and after return in to my celle. The mass said and done in the
said monasterye. And after yt he had received the holy sacrament / the said
young man would have returned in to his celle / but thabbot retained and would
not suffer him to go / till that he had taken his refeccyon. And which
refeccyon taken and graces said to god / he took leave of the said abbot and of
his relygyous monks for to go in to his celle. And in retournyng ye devil came
to hy^ again in ye form and likeness of a young seculer man. And by a manner
feigned for to come to his dampnable Intency on began to behold him ententyuely
from the top of the head unto his fete. And saying these words that the young
Relygyous man might well here. Is this he yt has so long be sought or is it
he not. And in saying these words / he contynuelly beheld more ententyfly
than he did before. For which cause the brother seeing that / said to him
what moeued the thus to behold me. To whom the devil answered. I believe fair
fader that ye know me not / whereof I am not sore abashed ne admeruaylled /
for ye can not well know me / seen the long time yt ye saw me /
nevertheless I know you well / for I am next neighbor to your house. And
ferthermore he named his fader and his mother / and a sister yt he had by their
names / and their servants also in sayng to hy^ / was not your fader called
thus and your mother by this name / and your sister in this wise / and thus
their seruytoues. My friend I assure you / yt your mother and sister deyed three
year agoon. And your fader departed out of this world but late. And he has
ordained you his heir and made you his excecutour for to dyspose well his
goods for ye health of his soul / he could not leave ne set they in a better
hade than in yours which be an holy man / and yt have given over and forsaken
ye world and all worldly goods for to walk and follow ye way of Ihesu
christ / hopyng yt for the great love and charity / that ye have to him / ye
shall be belly and dylygent for to dystrybute and give in alms by good and
type dyscreco^n his goods to the poor and nedy servants of god. And for
this cause he ordained ye one should come to you for to do for his sake this
request / and in following the said ordinance many messagers have been in
diverse places for to find you / but they could not here of you / so it is
happed yt in comy^g in to these parties / for certain things I have found you
here Wherefore moeued of charity and compassion and consyderyg ye great trust yt
your fader has in you. I have be moeued to tell it you / and therefore tarry
not / but for to fulfill the will and testament of your fader / and go to his
house / and selle all that he has / for to dele and dystrybute to poor people
after his holy deuoco^n. To who me ye relygyous young man answered / yt it was
not to hy^ necessary to return to ye world / and yt he would not go thither
And thereupon the devil replied again saying to him / yt if by his neclygence /
ye goods of his fader were lost and dysperpled without to be given to the
poor people as he had ordained / he should therefore give a rekenyng ones to
fore god. And forthermore he said to him these words / what harm say I if I
exhort and admoneste the yt you come as a good and true dyspe^satour and
dystrybutour to ye poor people ye goods of thy fader like as he trusted to ye
yt his goods should not have been meschyeuously wasted and consumed by vycyous
persons. See what charge may ye run in by thyn estymaco^n in so doing.
Thou know that you may in this thing get great merit for the health of thy
soul. And when you shall have that done / you shall mow return again in to thy
celle. Fynably this young Relygyous man was by the devil in such wise deceived
and begyled / that he was content to go home to the house of his fader / for to
do and fulfill that which the devil had said to him. And in deed he departed
from his hermytage / and with the devil he came in to the cite / in which he
was born in the which where tofore er be came in to his faders house the devil
departed from hy^. And after weuyng yt his fader had be deed / entered in to the
house for to do yt which he had entreprysed / but he found his fader a live
and in good point / the which knew not the young relygyous / but asked what he
was. Then this young relygyous man sore troubled knowing that he had be evil
seducet and deceyuyd by the devil / could not answer to his fader one word.
That seeing his fader that he answered not / began to ask again of hy^ whens he
was. To whom all confused he answered that he was his sone / and then his
fader asked him why he was returned from his hermytage / and because he was
ashamed to say him the truth / excused him and said that for great love yt
he had to him he was come for to see him. Thus then this young Relygyous man
abode in his faders house a certain time during the which in conuersyng among
worldly things he was perverted and in such wise abused by the fend of hell
that he fylle in to the sin of fornycaco^n / ye which thing comen to ye
knowloge of his fader / he was of him right rygourously entreated. But
nevertheless he set not thereby / ne did therefore no penance. And obstynat in
his sin / not feryng god ne ye shame of the world / returned no more in to
his hermytage / but lived dyssolutely to the great peril and da^pnaco^n of his
soul. And this hystorye recyteth ye said old fader for to counsel and
persuade a young relygyous man which had asked of hy^ counsel how he should
resyste his temptaco^ns / and that he should never depart out of his celle for
any manner te^ptaco^n what someuer the devil did to him.

Some certain seculer men came^ in to deserte unto a venerable old fader / and
asked of hy^ how he lived and conduyted him in his celle or hermytage / and if
he was well content of his astate in which he suffered so much pain. The
which old fader answered to them / that he had no cause to be ylle content /
seen that in trauayllyng and labouryng he might get the glory of heaven / and
esche we eternal dampnaco^n / sayng forthermore that all the labor and
trauayll that he had suffered in his hermytage / and yet had entente to suffer
and endure / though it were to the death / it were not suffysau^t to compare to
a Iourneye of the soroufull tourmentes that been prepared to miserable sinners /
the which for there outrageous crysmes and trespaces shall be perpetuelly dampened
with ye horrible fendes of hell.

An other old fader said that the old faders transported not themself from
one place to an other / but if by adventure and pryncypally for three causes.
The first was when any was angry with his brother / and he had done all his
devour to pacyfye him / and never thelesse was not content with him / In this
caas for to eschew the danger of his soul he ought to depart and leave the
place. That other was when that a relygyous man was over much known and
praised for his works to the end that he eschew the sin of vain glory. And
the third when he is evil ruled / and that he has co^mysed the sin of
lecherye.

A young brother required on a time of the holy fader Arsenye / that he would
give to him counsel / how he ought to by have hy^ / and said yt he was in
contynuell afflyccyon / because yt his conscience pryckyd hy^ sayng thus /
wherefore fastest thou not / wherefore labourest thou not / and why ghost you not to
vysyte ye seek people seen that they ben ye works of which ben worthy to be
praised and to have reward. The holy fader consyderyng ye such ymagynaco^ns
were deceytes of the devil said to hy^. My friend go ete and drink if you
may not fast / but above all things / keep yt from going out of thy celle.
For in perseueryng and there co^tynuyng thy resydence / you shall come to ye
state of perfecco^n. So then you brother went forth / and when he had made
contynuell resydence by the space of three days in his said celle / he found
hy^self gretely ennoyed and gryued. But nevertheless desyryng to abide / he
did so much yt he found a few palms yt which he te^pryd / and ye next
day following he made mattes / and as he was in maky^ge they / he had hu^gre /
and for to co^strayne himself to fast / he said to himself / yt he had a few
moo palms / whom he would dyspose and ordeyne for to set a work and after
he would ete. After yt be he had wrought yt he said yt yet he should not ete /
till yt he had a little read and prayed. And when he had a little read he
began to psalmodye / and soon after he being appealed of his fantasyes / he
took mete and began to ete. And in this manner by ye help of god which saw
his good purpose / he prouffyted in such wise yt he fond byselfe well
dysposed to abide and tarry in his celle / and to do ye which he ough to do
after ye Instytuco^ns of his order / and trusty^g in hy^self / yt ye
te^ptaco^ns ye should come to hy^ / might be belthfull to hy^ if be resysted
them / he took in himself so good courage / that lightly he ouercam they^ and
surmou^ted. An other aeged fader was demanded by a young relygyous brother. From
whens it might proceed / that a Relygyous person being abydyng and resydent in
his celle suffered and bare so great gryeuaunce. To whom he answered. you have
not yet seen ne well consydere in thy thought ye general resurrecco^n to come
/ ne have not enbraced ye torments ye then shall be made ready to they^ that
shall be then perpetuelly tormented. Certainly if you had well seen and
considered them / it should nothing grieve ne ennoye the to be in thy celle /
and suppose yet that it were so full of worms that you sholdest be therein unto
thy neck thou sholdest endure it / and be never ennoyed.

Some Relygyous persons having compassyon of the great trauayll and pain /
that in ouermoche labouryng an holy fader suffered they prayed him a little for
to rest / and leave somoche to travail. To whom he answered. My childern I
pray you to believe me of yt I shall now say to you. I assure you that the
holy fader Abraham / which all his life continued in great lakours for to get
ye sovereign health of his soul / when he shall see ye great and excellent
yeftes of god in the eternal glory / he shall repent him and shall be much
desplaysau^t of that he has not take on him more greter labors and pain that
he has yet had.

An other brother asked an au^cyent holy fader / how he should byhaue him with
his cogytaco^ns and thoughts which made hy^ so doubtful and inconstau^t that
he was incontynuell trybulaco^n. To whom ye aeged fader answered. My friend
hold and keep the in thy celle / and set naught though diverse thoughts
assayllen the / for you shall not perysshe if you keep ye therein. And if you issue
and go out as well shall they assaylle ye without as within. And like as ye
femall ass which is bound / goes not after her young fool / which goth at
large where it will and renneth all about / always it comes again to ye mother.
In likewise ye te^ptaco^n follows always ye relygyous and so lytary person.
And how well yt he be assaylled and be made to varye / yet has he no cause to
perysshe / for seen yt he depart not out of his celle / and that for the love
of god he enfore him self to abide and constantly reiecte them behind him.

There was an old holy fader which had no water nygh to him by.xij. english
mile. And on a time in going to the fou^tayne for to draw and fetch water /
he found hy^self so feeble that when he was there / uneath and with great
pain he might return home. And consyderyng in himself the great trauayll yt
he had for to goo and come so far he said in himself these words what need
is it for to go so far and with so great pain for to fetch water /
certainly I shall no more come so far / but I shall come and dyspose me to
come hither and dwell here at mine ease. And after yt he had so said / he saw
a young man as hy^ seemed that followed him / and in following nombred and
acompted his steps and paas. The old fader that seeing asked hy^ what he was
/ to whom he answered to hy^ that he was an angel of god / which had sent
him thither for to nombre his paas and to give to hy^ his reward. The which
answer herd by the old fader / he took in himself strength of courage / and
in hope to get ye gretter reward for the pain yt he took in gooyng to fetch
ye water at the said well / he went to make his habytaco^n more ferther than
it was before. Some old faders by manner of Instrucco^n sayden / if any
temptaco^ns come upon the in the place where you dwell / you ought not for
that to leave it / for if you so do / in what someuer place yt you shall go / thou
shall find to fore the that which that you supposedest to flee and eschew /
but you ought to be pacyente in resystynge it unto the time that the
temptaco^ns be goon / to the end that thy departing he not cause of sklaunder to
other.

An other Relygyous brother there was which among his felawes was not
peasyble / but oftentimes was moeued and provoked to wrath and ire / wherefore
he concluded in him self on a time that he would goo dwell in a solytary
place alone / that then when I shall be without company there shall be no
person that shall say any thing to mean to whom I ought to say any thing.
Then after license gotten he departed fro his monasterye / he went and
dwelled allone in a cave. And after yt he had dwelled a little while / he set
on the ground a little pot which he had filled with water / and suddenly
the pot fylle down in such wise that the water was shed / and the
Relygyous person seeing yt / fyllyd his pot again and anon fylle down as it
did to fore and yet he fyllyd it the third time / and the water was shed
again. Then he was sore moeued in furye and ire yt he could not be content /
but in his anger and passion took the pot and threw it against the ground and
brake it in pieces And after when his passion was passed he knew yt the spyryte
of wrath and deuelysshe mocked with him / wherefore seeing yt in solytude and
being allone as well as in company he was always over come of this yrous
passion / wherefore he concluded yt he should return and abide with his
brethern / knowing that every where and over all / labor is necessary and
pacyence. And for to have the said pacyence / every man ought to labor by the
help of god.

An other Relygyouse person asked of an holy fader to give to him some remedy
upon that he could not do any good work ye apperteyned to do to a right good
and virtuous relygyouse / but was deteyned and bywrapped in such sloth and
neclygence / yt he was content to pass ye time in etyng and drynkyng and in
slepyng. And above this there came on hy^ Infenyte thought foul and dyshonest of
which he was so afflycte and tormented yt if he began any good work / anon he
left it / and was transported fro thought to thought / in such wise yt he
had in hy^ neither stedfastnes ne constau^ce. The aeged fader said to hy^.
Brother go and abide in thy celle / and do that ye may without perturbaco^n.
Certainly / that little good yt ye enforcest the to do now shall be to the as
medeful for to be saved as were to the abbot Anthonye ye great good works yt
he made when he was in thermytage. And with this I have in god this trust and
affyau^ce / that who someuer for thonour and love of his name keep hy^
solytaryly in his celle / and enforces him to keep his conscience / he shall
find hy^self in the place of saint Anthonye.

An au^cyent fader was asked of a young Relygyous person / how he might keep
himself from sklaunder / when he saw any relygyous person return unto the
world. To whom he answerde that a Relygyous person yt will be constant and
not varye / in seeing a relygyous person return in to the world / ought to
behold and consider a chaas or course of hou^des ye run after an hare. Among
the which oftentimes there is one / the which all alone seeing the hare /
follows after in rennyng with all dylygence. The other hou^des yt see the
hou^de run / how be it yt they have not apperceyued the hare / yet sometime
run after the hou^de and follow hy^ aferre / and nevertheless they persyste
not but return and abide behynds. This notwithsto^dyng the hou^de which has
seen the hare / and leueth not the sight of hy^ always pursues hy^ unto that
he has taken hy^ / and torneth not from his course ne from his entencyon. For
he takes none head ne retcheth not though they abide behind or if they
return / for thaffecco^n yt he has to pursue his pray in pursuyng of ye
which / he fereth neither to tumble ne to fall / but always relyeueth
himself and passes forth without feryng of hedges or busshes / how be it yt
sometime he be hurt with thorns yt he fyndeth in his way / netheles be
sets not thereby till that he has taken the hare. In likewise the relygyous
person or other yt seeks our lord Ihu^ christ / that is to wit he that
desires by good works to obtain his grace Incessantly apply his entente to
be scourged and tourmented by penance / and pass lightly all the sclau^dres
that may come to him / unto the time that he come to the glory celestyall /
and in coming to the same he take Ihesu christ at that course / that is to wit
in rennyng after him / and in following hy^ by good manners. And then that he
come to ye same Joy / he take his pray which is the fruycyon of his precious
vysyon / in the which delyteth all the court celestyall.

An other aged fader said that like as a tree which is often dysplaunted and
transported from one ground to an other may bear no fruit. Likewise the
relygyous person that often goth from one place to an other may not prouffyte
ne do any work that is helthfull. There was a relygyous person which fond
him strongly oppressed and tempted to leave his monastery. And for as much as
he might not well withstand it / he declared to an old fader askyng him
herupon some remedy / the which cou^seylled him that he should go to his
celle / and that he should leye his body to wedde that he should not go out.
And in so doing he should pain himself to cast his thoughts away and say to
his body that he should think all that he would sauf oonly that he go not out
of his celle. And in so doing the said Relygyous vaynquysshed the said
temptacyon.

An other aged fader said that the celle of a relygyous person is lykened to
ye fornays or chemyney of Babylon where the three childern Sydrac. Mysaell / and
Abdenago fond the sone of god which kept them from brenny^ge. Or else to
the busshe / pyler / or cloud in which god spack to Moses.

A relygyous person was tempted contynuelly by the space of.ix. year for to
forsake ye company of his brethern. And to that end every day he did of his
pylche or skin in the which after his rule he had be accustomed to lie and
sleep in. And when it was even he said to him self. I shall depart and go
hens to morn / and on the morn I shall abide yet this day for the love of god
And when he had continued thus in this varyacyon by the space of.ix. year in
doing every day as said is / our lord took away from him that temptacyon.

An other Relygyous by force of te^ptaco^ns fond hy^ self so troubled that he
lost and left ye rule of relygyon. And living dyssolutely / as he would
sometime set himself to do well and come again to live Relygyously / his
temptaco^ns let him / wherefore he had great sorrow. And in bewaylyng the
time yt he had lost and wasted in lyuy^g myschau^tly said in him self. Alas
when shall I find my self in such astate as I was wont to be. And in making
such sorrow he purposed to amend him self. But nevertheless he had a courage
so sloth / that he could not ne would take again his relygyous life / wherefore
on a day he transported him unto an holy aged fader / to whom he reherced all
his miserable life / and how he could not put him to live well. The aged fader
knowing his myschaunt caas for to reduce him to good life / recou^ted to him
such an example as follows.

There was a man sometime / which had a fair pyece of land / the which he
left by his great neclygence turn in to so great ruin that hit was over
charged and grown with thystles / thorns / and great buysshes. Thynkyng on
this caas / a certain time after he concluded yt he would set again in value
ye same pyece of land. And said to his sone that he should go see in what
astate it was / and that he should make dylygence to wede and take away the
thystles and buysshes / and refresshe it. Then he faynyng to will obey his
fader / went to the said pyece of land. And as he beheld the great multitude
of thorns buysshes and thystles that grew thereon / he fond him self so
sloth and feeble of courage / that he could not begin to work / sayneg in him
self thus. A lord god how shall it be to me possible to stubble and make
clean this pyece of land here. Certaynely I shall never conne make an end
thereof / and leyde him self down on the ground by slouthe and latchesse / and
began to sleep. And so continued many days without doing of any labor. And
the fader desyryng to see what his sone had done in the said loud. On a day
he went thither / and fond that he had nothing labored / and asked him why he
had noothyng done. And he answered to him wenyng to sense him / yt when he was
come and had seen the great habundau^ce of thystles and thorns / he could not
enterprise so great labor / and for yt cause he leyed him down and slept. His
fader heryng his answer / repreued him of his sloth and latchednes / and said
to hy^ yt he should begin to labor / and should not do but a certain one
day / and as much an other day / upon which he so did in obeyng the
commandment of his fader. And when he saw in labouryng that it began to
amend / he took therein great pleasyr / yt in short time / it was refresshyd
and made clean. In like wise my brother said the old fader. It byhoueth to the
a little and little to work / and in so dooyng the courage shall not faylle the
/ and god by his holy grace shall restore the in to thy former astate This
heryng the relygyous man took leave of the holy fader in thankyng hy^ mekely and
in good pacyence. And with great constau^ce made resydence in his celle / and
began to work like as the holy fader had instruct and taught hy^. And in this
manner fyndyng rest / he was promoted by our lord to right devout and
virtuous life.

There was an old fader the which had be accustomed to be often enfebled by
sekenes. And it happed yt it was the pleasyr of god yt during an hole year he
was hooll and in good point without to be touched ne gryeued with any bodily
sekenes. And consyderyng in himself yt he was in over great health he entered
for this cause in a great melancolye / of the which he was strongly tourmented
/ and wept saying yt god had left and forgoten him because that he vysyted
hy^ no more with sekenes.

An other aged holy fader said yt an other brother was by the space of.lx. year
so sharply tempted of evil and dyshonest temptaco^ns that he might no more
withstand ne resyste them. And thynkyng on his caas of the fere and dread
that he had / he ran in to dyspayr / and Iugyng him self to be dampened said
in him self. Now see I well / that my soul is lost for ever. And sith that it
is so that there is no remedy I am a fooll and abuse my well my self to
abide and keep me here. Come thereof what it shall I will return to the world
/ and set him self on the way for to goo. And anon he herd a voys that
said to hy^. Poor man why there ghost thou / herkene to me / and believe that I
shall say to the. I will that thou wit / that the temptacyons that thou have
these.ix. year born and suffered / were fair crowns for to crown the in the
everlasting glory. And therefore I exhort the and admoneste that thou return
in to thy celle / and do always penance and I shall releue the of thy evil
thoughts. By the which example that one ought never to despair of the mercy
of god / and also one ought to have good hope of retrybucyon when he is tempted
of evil thoughts / so that he enforce him to withstand them with all
dylygence. For in so doyeng he deserves to be excellently crowned in the
Royalme of heaven.

In the parties of The bayde there was an aged holy fader which dwelled in a
deep fosse or cave / with whom dwelled one his discyple well approved in holy
life and conuersacyon. Now this holy fader had a custom every day / and
also at even to enseyne and teache his dyscyple / and to admoneste him to
helthfull and prouffytable works for his soul. And after they put them
togydre to pray to god and make devout prayers. And that done the holy fader
gaaf him leave to go and sleep a little and rest him.

On a time among the other it happened that some persons seculer well
aduertysed of the holy life of the said fader camen for to see hy^ for to have
in their aduersyters some consolacyon And after that he had comforted them and
were departed from hy^ / he called his dyscyple to talk with hy^ for his health
like as he had be acustomed to do / and because it was late in spekyng to him
he fill a sleep. But that notwithstanding / his dyscyple departed not taryeng
till the old fader should awake for to deuyse with hy^ and to make their
prayers after their custom. As then the said holy fader slepte / his
dyscyple abydyng a long while by hy^ was tempted to go to his rest nethelesse
he with stood the temptaco^n / and concluded to abide and tarry till the holy
fader was awaked / and notwitstondyng this delyberaco^n he was thus tempted
unto.vij. times / and all.vij. times he withstode it such wise yt he
surmou^ted yt said te^ptaco^n. So it happed yt the mydnyght passed ye holy
fader awoke / and saw his dyscyple syttyng by hy^ / whom he asked why he went
not to sleep. To whom he answered yt he had no will to go / because he had give
him no license. And wherefore said yt holy fader have you not awaked me / because
said ye dyscyple yt I dredde to trouble or do any gryef to ye. These words
said / they began to say their matynes / yt which said and achyeued / the holy
fader let his dyscyple go. The said holy fader then being allone in his
couche was rauysshed in spyryte. And in this rauysshement he saw a vysyon / in
the which appyered a fair yonglyng which showed to hy^ a plain place in
glory / in which among other setes / there was one excellent / wherein satte
no person / and upon ye sete there were set.vij. crowns rich and sumptuous
/ the which seeing ye holy fader asked him yt showed them to hy^ to whom they
belonged. And he answered to him / yt they were bylongyng to his dyscyple / and
yt our lord for the retrybuco^n of his holy life and good co^uersaco^n had
given them to hy^ / and had assygned his place in that fair syege on which
were the crowns. The which things heryng the holy fader was meruayllously
abashed / and all ferdfull called his dyscyple and asked hy^ what thing he
had done that night. To whom he answered. Fair fader pardone me if it please
you I have nothing done. The holy fader estemyng that the dyscyple by his
humylyte would not confess that he asked of him / said to him / believe me. I
shall not leave the in peace / if ye say not to me what thing yt have done or
thought this night. To whom the dyscyple wist not what to answer because he
had done no thing. Nevertheless he aduysed him self to tell him the will yt
he had in this manner. My fader I require the of pardone / certainly I have
nothing done sauf oonly this night as you sleptest. I being beside the / because
it was late I had be mened and constrained by my vain thoughts and
cogytaco^ns not oonly one time / but unto the.vii. time for to have left the
slepyng and have goon to rest me. But nevertheless for as much as I had no
leave of the / as I have be accustomed. I had not wylled to go / but in
obseruyng and keeping mine obedyence toward the / and in betyng down mine
affeccyons / did constrayne my self to hold company with yt unto the time
yt you were awaked. The holy fader heryng these words anon understood by ye
vysyon yt he had / that at every time yt ye dyscyple had resysted his
te^ptacyons he had obtained a crown of god / and therefore he had granted to
him vij. crowns of gold yt he had seen in ye said vysyon / but nevertheless he
said nothing ne showed it to his dyscyple for his vtylyte and prouffyte /
doubtyng yt if any had told hy^ thereof / he paradue^ture might fall in the
sin of vain glory / by which he might left yt merit yt he had gotten
which tofore is said nevertheless he could not keep hy^ from recytyng to some
old faders his spyrytuell friends to the end to give knowleche yt for such
little works when they ben constantly done and in good perseuerau^ce / god
which is so lyberall and great rewarder promyseth first to us so gretely for
to crown us with so many crowns in ye glory sovereign. Then is it good and
much puffytable to every christian man to refreyne his passions and co^strayne
him to line virtuously for the honor of god. For as says the holy scripture /
the Royame of heaven would be gotten by force / and the which ben co^strau^t and
coragyously assayllen rauysshe it and taken it by vyolence.

An other old fader solytary which dwelled allone / was on a time strongly
seek. And because yt he had no person to serve hy^ was constrained to arise
for to take such refecco^n as he fo^de in his ralle / and so he did certain
days after his possybylyte. Fynably he becam so feeble yt he might no more help
him self. So.xxx. days during he was in this pouerte. Our lord seeing his
right great pacyence / and yt none of his brothrn had none remembrance of hy^
/ therefore he sent his angel which admynystred and served hy^ during.vij.
days in all things yt to hy^ was necessary. At last some of the brethern
of the holy fader remembered hy^ / which had their celles and habytaco^ns nygh
to him / and had not in long time seen hy^ / concluded for to go and see him
for to wit if he had any necessyte. And when they were come to his celle and
knocked at yt door for to enter in. The angel anon departed from him. And
ye holy fader seeing ye began to cry to ye said brethern / he lyeng in his
couche and said to them My brethern I pray you go your way. They heryng his
answer and desyryng to know how he did lift up ye door from of yt hengis /
and entered in And after asked him why he so cried. To whom he answered yt he
had be.xxx. days seek dury^g yt which noman had vysyted hy^. And after
the.xxx. passed our lord had sent hy^ his angel which had entreated hy^
much swetely in seruyng to hy^ by the space of.vij. days / and this is then
the vij. day / but as soon as he herd you at door he departed from hy^.
And in saying these words he rendered and gaaf up his soul to god / the same
brethern being present. The which merually^g them self gloryfyeden the name
of god in saying / yt he never faylleth they^ that setten in him their hope.

An aged fader said / if you be taken and suffrest pain of any hodely sickness
/ therefore give not thy self as ouercome^ and consydere yt if god will yt you be
enfebled in thy body / he does it for thy vtylyte and prouffyte. Therefore you
ought not take it grutchyngly ne dyspleasau^tly / know you not well yt he
has often cure and dylygence for to purueye in thy necessytees after yt you have
need for thy health / wetest you not well also yt you may not live without hy^.
Bear you then pacyentely the Infyrmytees yt he sends to the / in prayeng hy^
humbly yt it please hy^ to give to the yt which is expedyent and necessary.
And also yt you do always his will / without any thing to do contrary / and
hold the solytaryly and in pacyence in thy celle etyng in charity that which
you may get.

An other old fader recyted yt he being in ye cite of oxirinque on a saturday
at even / there came much poor people for to ask alms of devout creatures
/ they being and slepyng in a common place / where as one among the other
which had a unthrifty matte / of which upon half whereof he lay / and of
the other half he covered hy^ for ye cold which was then extremely great /
the same poor creature being constrained to arise for to make his vryne /
co^playned in him self of the great cold / in sayng to our lord. My god I
thank the of the goods yt it pleases the to do to me. How many rich men ben
now in this world that for their trespases or other caas to them happed be
now prisoners / and have their legs fethered in stocks and in great feteres
of iron / the which gryeue and ennoye them / and have no leyzer to do and to
make their aysement when they need. And as touching to me / you have do so much
good to me yt I am frank and free as an Emperor stratchyng my fete to my ease
/ and walkyng where as it please me. And these words said ye holy fader yt had
herd them. Incontinent departed and came and reherced them his brethern
which were thereby meruayllously well edyfyed.

An other brother asked on a time an old fader in demau^dyng hy^ what he should
do / if he were in any place solytary what someuer trybulaco^n or temptaco^n
came upon hy^ / the which he well fered as he said / seen yt he had no person
that might conforte hy^ or that he might trust to / ne to whom he might
declare his aduersyte. To whom ye holy fader answered. My brother it behooves to
ye always to believe steadfastly in god And if you trust in hy^ and pray to hy^
and requyryng in good charity / he shall conforte the by his angel which he
shall send to ye with his grace. And further more he said to hy^ yt on a time
he herd say / yt in Sychye such a caas was happed of a relygyous person
solytary that suffered many temptaco^ns / and had noon Relygyous by him to whom
he might trust ne to confess hy^ to / wherefore oftymes he dysposed hy^ to go
his way / but because he had often resyste it on a night among yt other
appyered to hy^ ye grace of our lord in ye lykenes of a virgyne / which
prayeng hy^ affectuously said to hy^ thus. My friend goo not out of thy celle /
but sytte here with me. For of ye thing yt you have herd shall come to the none
evil / the which relygyous brother gyuyng faith to her words / concluded to
abide / and anon his heart was alleged.

Here follows an other little treatise conteynyng that no thing should be done
for exaltaco^n or vain glory.


Saint Anthonye being in deserte was on a time aduertysed yt a Relygyous
person which had always be reputed virtuous had done a miracle by elaco^n or
vain glory in this manner / he seeing some aged faders walkyng and gooyng with
great pain / commanded some wild asses which were about by their way that
they should transporte them toward them and bring them to hy^. The which
miracle the said old faders notefyeden to Saint Anthonye / which said to
them such words or likewise in substauene. This monk to mine advise is
lykeneth to a ship laden with all goods / of ye which is noman certain if
it shall come to port salewe. Certain time after Saint Anthonye seeing before
in spyryte of reuelaco^n or otherwise this young Relygyous man to be soon
departed by death fro thaduersytees of this world / and began suddenly to
waylle and weep and draw his here and make merueyllous lamentaco^ns / yt
which thing seeing his dyscyples / and not knowing ye cause of his wepynges
and wayllynges axed hy^ wherefore he wept. To whom he answered / yt a great
pyler of the church was then fall / in saying to them furthermore. Goo ye
toward ye relygyous brother / which made yt other day ye miracle of the wild
asses and ye shall see in what astate he is now The same dyscyples obeyng to
saint Anthonye went forth their way and camen to this young relygyous man /
whom they fond lyeng upon a matte and weeping bytterly ye great sin yt he
had done. And he seeing the dyscyples of saint Anthonye said to them. I pray
you my brethern say to the old fader yt he will pray to god for me / yt it
may please hy^ to give me respyte of.x. days and I hope yt during them I shall
do so much that he shall be content of me. Notwithstanding be departed and
deyed five days after following.

Some Relygyous persons sometime made to saint Anthonye many great and lowable
reports of humylyte of one of their brethern / wherefore saint Anthonye
desyryng to know if he were such as they sayden / called ye same relygyous
man and said to hy^ many great Iniuryes / yt which he might not pacyently bear
/ and said to hy^ that he was like to an house yt which before outward is
much ornate and enryched of sumptuous work / but behind all vnshytte and so
ruynous that the theuys have left nothing that ought is worth.

Many aged faders sayen of ye holy faders Arsenye and Theodore called the
steadfast / yt above all things they hated vain glory worldly. Always Arseny
when any Relygyouses camen to hy^ / he hasted not to go against them. But
Theodore did the contrary.

A priest named Eulogius which was dyscyple of saint Johan archebysshop of
Alexandrye was of a meruayllous abstynence / for he fasted two days in ye weke
without to ete any thing / and often he fasted ye surplus of the weke in etyng
ones oonly on the day and ete but bread and salt. And for this cause and for
his other virtues / he was much praised and allowed of the people. On a time he
came to the abbot Joseph in a place named Panese / wenyng yt the said Joseph
ladde a life more strayt than he. The said Joseph received hy^ in great Joy /
made to hy^ for good love and charity to prepare his refeccyon the most
honestly yt he might. And seeing ye dyscyples of Eulogius yt he had other mete
than yt which he had taken to ete / sayden yt Eulogius ete not but bread and
salt. But nevertheless the abbot Joseph which would not yt every man knew his
great abstynences preuely ete of the mete yt he had ordained for Eulogius. And
during three days yt the said Eulogius and his dyscyples soyourned with the
holy abbot Joseph / they never apperceyued yt the said Joseph ne his dyscyples
psalmodyed or made any prayers. But nevertheless they prayden and said their
psalms secretly / wherefore Eulogius and his dyscyples departed with out to be
suffysau^tly edyfyed. And as they walked it pleased to god yt the weder
changed and becam derke in such wise / yt for this cause they were
constrained to return to ye fader Joseph. And when they knocked at ye yate of
the monasterye they herd ye said Joseph and his brethern which songen and
psalmodyed. They herked a long while their psalmodye / and after yt they had
long herked / fynably they knocked at yate / whom again the holy fader
received much Ioyously. The dyscyples of Eulogius for ye great hete had
brought a little botell / in which they put water of the which ye holy fader
Joseph was wont to drink / and they gave ye same to Eulogius for to drink
for to afresshe hy^ but when he felt and had tasted it / he would not drink
it / because he felt by ye taste yt it was salt. And for to say the truth
it was not sweet / for they were waters of the sea and of the ryuers meddled
togydre. And this thing in his courage / he required ye holy man Joseph yt he
should enseygne and teache hy^ his manner of living saying / how is it holy fader
so / that when I came first hither ye song not ne psalmodyed / and now sith we
departed ye have bygonne to do it. And furthermore when I would have dronken of
your water. I fond that it was salt. To the which questyon the abbot Joseph
answered / that which of all his Relygyous brethern were any thing troubled by
error should meddle salt water with ye fresshe. Then Eulogius not content
with this answeer / and wyllyng to know of that he asked prayed him again that
he should say to him / fro whens it proceeded that the said water was salt. To
whom ye holy fader answered saying / that this little buurage was instead of
wine ye charity had pourueyed to them / but that water was the ordynary drink
that the relygyous brethern drank / by which words he taught Eulogius how he
ought to have dyscrecyon in his thoughts / and drive away from hy^ all
mutabylyte of courage / and that he should make him self common with the other
brethern etynge fro thens forthon all metes that were set tofore him. Also he
taught him how he should secretly pray. And these things by hy^ considered
he said to Joseph / that certainly he knew his works and also of his
dyscyples to be done in parfyght charity.

The abbot Zenon which had be dyscyple of the abbot Syluayn said / that a
relygyous man ought never to desire to dwell in a place greatly reno^med / ne
with a man having a great name / ne set or make any fondemente for to build
to him self a celle or habytacyon.

On a time came a brother to thabbot Theodore called the steadfast and soyourned
three days with him / prayeng hy^ that he would say to him some word of
edyfycacyon. But he would say no thing to him. And seeing the said relygyous
that he had no will to say any thing to him / departed full heavy and
sorrowful. The which thing seeing the dyscyple of the said Theodore /
demanded wherefore he would not say to him some good word / to the end that he
had not departed evil content of him. To whom the holy fader answered / that
he would say nothing to hy^ because he was a great merchant and entermeter /
the which inquired and demanded to know some new thing for to gloryfye him
self in the words of an other.

An other brother asked the said Theodore in enquyryng him of some things / of
which he would never entermete. To whom the holy fader answered I am abashed
how thou presumest to ask me of such things. Thou resemblest to hy^ which
yet had not fond ye ship / ne put his maryners therein / ne also begone to
rowo nor saylle. And yet is comen to the port or Cite where he had dysposed to
come / when you have first done some thing / then may you well speak.

Thabbot Cassyen said that a brother which had learned to trotte from place to
place came on a time toward ye holy fader Serapyon / the which holy fader
after some words wylly^g to pray god or to psalmodye with the said brother bad
him begin / and he would follow. To which exhortacion the said brother would
not enclyne / saying by faint humylyte that he was a sinner and unworthy to
bear the habyte of a monk. And after the said holy fader would wesshe his fete
/ but the brother excusing hy^ as he did before would not suffer him. Fynably
he made him take his refecco^n with him. And in so doing he began to admonest
hy^ sayng My sone if you wylt prouffyte / it byhoueth the co^tynuelly to make
resydence in thy celle / and to take heed of thy self / and employe yt to
work / for it is not lawful ne expedyent to go so much as it is to be
resydent / ye which brother heryng these words was so much in despyte and
moeued in ire against ye said holy fader yt suddenly he apperceyued by his
vysage yt by ye cause he changed his color. and began to say to hy^. Ha my
sone you saydest late that you were a sinner / in accusyng thy self as unworthy
to live / and now by cause I warn yt in good charity to live well / you art
angry with me and ought you to do so / certainly I tell to ye yt if you wylt
be very and humble relygyous / you must learn and bear corageously the charges
and burdens yt by other shall be leyd on the / and not to say and grudge in
thy self to think any rygorous or heinous words. For such condyco^ns ought
not to be fonden ne to domyne in any relygyous man wyllyng to come to felycyte
and beatytude eternal. The brother co^syderyng these words yt ye holy fader
said to hy^ / he departed and did great penance and amended his life.

Thabbot Moses being in the hermytages of the deserte of Sychye was aduertysed
yt the Judge of the prouynce came toward him for to see him and vysyte /
wherefore he desyryng teschue that he should not see hy^ / departed from his
hermytage / and put him self in the way of the palus of Egypt / in which way
the said Judge accompanied with some of his servants met him / and axed of
him where was the celle of the abbot Moses / the which answered hy^ /
wherefore axe ye after hy^ / he is a man folysshe and an heretyke. The Judge
arrived at the common church of the said hermytages / and said to ye clerks yt
he fond there / how for ye great reno^mee of ye abbot Moses desyryng to see
him he was come thither. And yt in coming he met an old fader gooyng in to
Egypt whom he asked where was the celle of thabbot Moses / and he answered me
in this manner / wherefore sekest you him / he is an heretyke. The clerks heryng
these words of the said Judge were much troubled and dyspleasau^t / but
nevertheless they asked what man was ye old fader that had so evil and
synystryly spoken of the said abbot Moses. To whom the Judge answered he is
long and black and clad with a lewd vestement. Then they knew yt it was
thabbot Moses which had so spoken of him self / and said to the Judge that he
had said those words to the end that the Judge should not know hy^ / wherefore
the said Judge returned without spekyng more to hy^ and without to see him any
otherwise than said is.

An other brother asked the holy fader Mathoys saying to hy^. Fair fader if I
go and be resydent in any place how ought I to govern me in the same / if you
wylt surely dwell in any place / keep the well for getyng a name or reno^me of
any partycular thing as to say that you wylt not converse in the company of
brethern for to lead a life more solytary / or that you ete not one thing or
other. By such things a man geteth to him a name and fame. And after he must
suffer this portunyte of the people / which is a thing much grievous if he be
a man yt desires to live virtuously and solytary.

The great abbot Nesteron and one of his relygyouses walkyng in ye deserts
saw to fore them a great dragon / for whom to eschew inco^tynent they fled
/ ye which thing seeing ye said relygyous said to ye said abbot / yt he was
aferde. To whom he answered nay yt he was not / but it was to hy^ expedyent to
flee / seeing ye dragon. For in so doing he fled the speryte of vain glory /
as who says yt if by ye moyen of some co^iuraco^ns divine yt he had made to ye
dragon they had passed by hy^ without yt he had done to them any harm / they
might have run in ye sin of vain glory / wherefore for to keep hy^ therfro
/ it seemed to hy^ better and more auayllable to flee fer from hy^ than to
co^iure hy^. The abbot Pastor said yt a Relygyous man yt will well edyfye other
for to give to them good example / ought to keep and observe ye things which
he will be kept and observed by other. And forthermore he said yt he meruaylled
of many men yt have no shame that will be parfyght by words / wherein their
deeds they be much less.

Thabbot Adelphus which was bishop of Nyl went on a time in to a mo^tayn for
to see ye holy fader Sysoy. In a morny^g ye said bishop would depart fro hy^
/ but thabbot Sysoy volde first make hy^ to break his fast / how well yt it was
then a fasting day / and thus as they leyd ye table for to ete / came upon
them two brethern / to whom ye holy fader ordained to give them potage /
because yt they came fro labor. The holy bishop Adelphus seeing ye refecco^n
to be ready. said a part to the fader Sysoy / that he should defer a little
to ete / till yt the two brethern were gone / to the end that they should not
say that he brake his fast / notwithstanding ye words that thabbot Sysoy
said to his relygyouses that they should give to them ye potage that he had do
set on ye fire for ye said bishop Adelphus. The which brethern seeing and
receyuyng ye potage axed of ye relygyous that served them if there were any
strangers in ye celle of the said abbot Sysoy. And if the said abbot brake his
fast in the morning with them. To whom he answered / ye / the which answer
herd they were much angry and began to say. God forgive you ye fault that ye
do / in suffryng our abbot to ete at this hour. Ne know ye not well that he
has been many days without labor / as who should say / that he ought not to
break his fast / seen that he labored not. The bishop Adelphus heryng these
words repented hy^ and was dyspleasau^t of that which he had said to thabbot
Sysoy for to make break him his fast saying. Fader abbot pardone me / for yt I
have said and thought is a thing humayne / but in co^mau^dyng to give the
potage you haste done a thing dyuyne. Then said to him thabbot Sysoy. if god
gloryfye not a man / his glory shall never be stable.

The abbot Amenas said to the abbot Sysoy that he should apply hy^ to read ye
scryptures / to the end to learn to aorne and make fair his words / and for to
be ready answer to all askynges that should be made to hy^. Sysoy said that it
was no need to read for to make his words fair / but a man ought virtuously
pourueye him of holiness in his words / by clennes of conscience / as who
would say / that a man that lives virtuously can not speak evil ne ylle. The
abbot Symeon being in deserts. A Judge of a prouynce came for to see him. And
in coming he fond the said Symeon / which by the aid and help of his
gyrdell was clo^men on a palmyer for to make it clean. And asked him not
knowing that it was he Where was the old fader Symeon that dwelled there
solytaryly. And he answered that there was noman there solytary / the which
answer herd by the Judge / he departed. An other time came an other Judge for to
see hy^ / of which thing his dyscyples were aduertysed / and came saying to
hy^. Fair fader make you ready / for here comes a great man for to see you and
for to have your blessyng. To whom the holy fader Symeon answered. Now well
well. I shall make me ready / and went and took an old sack wherewith he
covered his head and his sholdres / and holdyng in his hand bread and chese
set hy^ down and ete at the door of his celle as he had ete no mete three
days before. The Judge and his people arrived there seeing his co^tynau^ce
set nothing by him. And returned saying as by mocquery / is this ye monk
solytary of whom we have herd say so many things.

Saint Syncletyce that in like wise that as a tresour that is publysshed and
showed is often mynysshed and dyspendyd. In like wise every virtue after that it
is publysshed / lightly is put away and fynysshed. And all in like wise as
wax which is nygh ye fire is molten. In like wise ye soul which is praised
becomes vain / and leseth the rygour of virtue. He said furthermore yt all in
like wise as it is Impossyble a thing to be in one time both herb and seed.
So it is Impossyble yt they yt have glory mondayn and delight them therein
maken any fruit for to have the heavenly glory.

In a hye fest hallowed among ye relygyouses of ye hermytages / in ye which
they had a custom to take their refecco^n in ye church. One relygyous man
among ye other called one of ye servant in saying yt he ete no boiled mete /
but oonly bread and salt / ye which thing herd by ye said servant / he
called an other in saying to hy^ openly with an hye voys Bring some salt to this
brother here / for he eteth none other thing. And one of ye old faders heryng
ye arose up and came to the Relygyous yt a^ed for salt / and said to hy^ yt it
had be more expedyent to have eten flesh in his celle than to have herd ye
words yt had be said of hy^ to fore so many relygyous people / as who should
say yt he ought to be ashamed / to have herd recyted of him after his own
word that he ete no thing but bread and salt. For if he had be virtuous none
ought to apperceyue it.

On a time unto an aged fader were come some strangers / to whom for their
refecco^n he had do make good potage and it happed yt ye same time came to hy^
a brother much abstynent / and yt ete no bread / they syttyng at table and
bego^ne to ete / he brought chiches for himself and ete them in ye company of
ye other / and after yt they were risen fro ye table / an aged fader called
secretly ye brother and said to hy^ / Brother when you shall come herafter to fore
any men / keep the well fro showing to hy^ / or from letyng hy^ apperceyue
thyn abstynence or co^uersaco^n / and if you will do any strayt abstynence /
keep yt in thy celle and go not out. The said relygyous heryng these words /
and enclyned to them / and determined to live like to ye other / and to ete
such mete as should be brought in to the company of other relygyous folk.

An other holy fader said that the humayne prouydence takath away and cutteth
from him all fattenesse and yeldeth him dry.

An other old fader said if you wylt holsomly live / it behooves the in fleeyng
the world to flee fro the men in mockyng the said world and the men that been
therein / and to repute and feign thyself to be a fooll.

An other lytyl treatise rechyng how noman ought to Judge any other.


A Relygyous monk being under the charge and congregacyon of the abbot Helye
happed on a time a temptaco^n or a cause for the which he was put out of the
congregacyon. And he went up to a montayne unto the holy abbot saint Anthonye.
And after that he had abyden by a certain time / he sent him again to the
congregaco^n from whens he was departed / but incontinent that his felawes saw
him / they put him out again / wherefore yet efte ones he returned unto the said
fader Anthonye layeng to him that they would not receive him. And for that
cause the holy fader sent to them such a parable A ship has be in danger
for to be perysshed in the sea / where she has left the charge that she bare /
and with great labor and pain she has be brought unto land / ye then my
brethern will ye drown and do perysshe the ship that has be delivered. They
knowing by these words / that the said holy abbot Anthonye had sent him again
to them / and anon agreably they received him.

A relygyous monk had co^mysed a sin / for the which he was constrained by
a priest to avoid out of ye church. The abbot Besaryon at that time being
present arose up and went also out / saying to him that he was a sinner / as
was the said Relygyous monk.

The abbot Ysaac dwelled in the deserts of Thebayde / and saw on a time
among the other in the congregacyon of the relygyouses / among whom he saw
one that was culpable of a sin / for the which he Iuged the said relygyous.
And in retornyng in to his hermytage / wenyng to enter in to his celle / he
fond thangall of god which let hy^ to enter / saying yt he would not
suffer hy^ to enter in. And ye said abbot asked of hy^ ye cause. And he
answered hy^ / yt god had sent hy^ for to ask of hy^ whyther he would send
yt brother which he had Iuged / and anon thabbot kneled down on his knees / in
repenty^g hy^ of yt which he had said / and requyry^g of thangell yt he would
pardone him. To whom he answered yt he should arise / and yt god pardo^ned him
/ but he aduertysed hy^ yt fro thens forthon he should beware and keep hy^ from
Iugyng of any person / before yt god had Iuged. In the deserts of Sychye was
fond culpable one of ye Relygyouses that dwelled there for thoffence or sin
of whom byhoued all the old and au^cyent faders assemble togydre / and by
delyberaco^n they sent for thabbot Moses / prayeng him yt he would come to
them / the which thing he would not do / wherefore the pryncypall among them
sent to him / prayeng hy^ again yt he would come to them all / which had
concluded to abide for hy^ / the which thing by him understood / took an
old walet or sack full of sonde / the which he bare upon his back / and so
came in this astate unto the said aged faders. The which comen tofore them /
they axed him what thing it was yt he bare. And he answered to them. These ben
my sins that run after me / the which I may not bear / and ye make me to
come hither for to Judge ye sy^nes of an other They heryng these words / told
to hy^ nothing of the sin of the relygyous brother / but voluntaryly
pardonned him.

The abbot Joseph asked on a time thabbot Pastor in requyryng him how he might
make him self a very monk. To whom thabbot Pastor answered in this manner. If
thou wylt in this world and in ye other find any rest examyne thy self in
all thyn affayre^ in saying to thy self / what am I and with this keep the
well fro Iugyng of any other.

An other brother asked on a time the said abbot Pastor in demau^dyng him if I
see my brother co^myse any sin / shall it be well done for me to hyde it. The
holy man answered to him. As often and as many times as we hyde the sin of our
brethern / god hydeth ours And also when we dysclose them / god dyscloseth ours.

A relygyous in plain congregacyon of monks / did an open offense. And nygh
to the place where the caas happed was a relygyous monk solytary / which
then by long time had kept resydence in his celle without in any wise to go
out. Thabbot of the same congregacyon transported himself toward ye said
relygyous solytary / in showing to him the sin of the other relygyous monk /
and asked him what he ought to do therein. To whom he said / that he should put
him out of the company of the other. The which thing done / the poor sinner
went and put him in a cave / where be waylled and wept long for his sin.
And it happed that his brethern and felawes going toward the said abbot Pastor
/ fond the said monk sorrowful weep / went down in to the cave / and fond
him there much heavy and desolate. And prayed him that he would go unto the
said solytary Relygyous man / but he would not / saying that he never would
depart fro the place where he was in / and that he had concluded to deye
therein. The same brethern then coming toward the abbot Pastor / reherced to
him how they had founden the poor penytent / much heavy and despleasaunt and
bytterly by weeping his sin. The abbot pastor considering his great
contrycyon / prayed them that they should goo and say to him that he sent
for him / that he should come and speak with him / which they so did / and
he came anon. The said abbot seeing him so contryte / aroos and kyssed him.
And in reioycyng him self with him / prayed hy^ that they should take togydre
their refecco^n. And after the said abbot sent one of his brethern to the said
relygyous in sendyng to him that for the good Renommee that he herd say of
his person / he had desired of long time to see him / how be it that for
the slouthe and latchesse of them both they had not yet seen each other.
And prayed him that if he had then any leysyr / that he would trauaylle to
come to him to the end that they might see each other. Then the said
relygyous which had be accustomed to live solytaryly that he never issued out
of his celle / ymagyned and said in him self / that if god had not Inspyred
the holy abbot Pastor to send for hy^ to come to hy^ / he was not aduysed to
have done it / wherefore inco^tynent he came to the said abbot Pastor / which
much humaynly received him. And after that they had devised togydre of many
helthfull things / the said Pastor said to him these words or semblable. Two
men were in a place / and each of them had in his celle a deed brother / that
one of them leuyng his deed brother came to the celle of his felawe bewepyng
the death of ye other / by the which words he gaaf to understand to the said
relygyous / that in forgetyng his sins / he was over rygorous to punysshe the
sin of that other. Then the same relygyous reducynge to his mind that
which he had done said to him. O virtuous man Pastor thou art in heaven on hye
/ and I am a low in therthe.

An other brother that said himself to be much dredefull asked of the said
abbot Pastor how he might withstand it. To whom he answered / that he should
not despise nor condemn any man / and that he should not be aduersarye to any
person. And in this doing / god should give him rest and should hold him in
his celle without perturbacyon.

In the deserts of Sychye / was on a time made certain congregacyon of
relygyous men / among whom was put forth and spoken of a brother / which was
culpable of some sins. The abbot Pyor being in the said congregacyon / held
his peace and said nothing And when every man had said that him seemed good / he
departed fro them And after he came again / and brought upon his back a great
sack full of sonde. And to fore he bare a little of the same sonde in a little
bag or walet. The other holy faders and relygyouses seeing that / demanded
him what he would do with that sonde. And he answered them that it which was
on his back in so great habundau^ce / sygnefyed his own sins which he had
put behind him / not for to Remember them / and had forgeten them in such
manner that he could not sorrow nor weep for them. And that which he bare
before him in so little quantyte / sygnefyed the little sins of this
Relygyous brother / that he says he has set to fore him / that is to say in
his remembrance and mind / and he said that in leuyng to correct his own
sins / which he said to be great / he excercysed him self in the correccyon
of them of the said relygyous that were so little which I ought not to do
said he. But I ought to set mine own sins to fore me and think on
thamendement and correccyon of them / and pray god that he would forgive
them me. The which words herd by the holy faders / they all said that this
way was salutarye and helthfull.

An old ancient fader said that a man how well that he were chaste ought not
for to Judge a fornycatour. for in co^mysyng the sin of fornycacyon / he
breketh the law. In likewise does he that Iugeth. For our lord which has
said / thou shall do no fornycacyon. In likewise says thou shall not Judge an
other.

A curate or other priest admynyster of a church / came on a time unto a
solytary relygyous man / prayeng him that he would mynystre the sacrament of
the altar to him / the which he did gladly diverse times. And anon after
came to the solytary monk a another that accused of a sin the said priest /
the which coming to the said solytary man for to be comyned as he had be
acustomed. And he might never do so much yt the said Relygyous solytary man
would ones open his door / wherefore the priest seeing that / anon departed.
And incontinent the said solytary monk herd a voys which said to hy^ these
words. The men have take from me my Judgment. After which voys herd / he was
rauysshed in a vysyon in such wise yt him seemed that he saw a pytte of gold
in which there was good water. And with this he saw a lepre or lazar that
drew up of ye same water / and put it in a vessel. And how be it yt the said
solytary monk desired to drink thereof / nevertheless he drank not / because
yt he ye haled it up was a lepre. And the said voys said again to hy^ / wherefore
drynkest not you of this water / what lettyng does he to the ye draws it / he
draws it up oonly and puts in his vessel without any corruptynge or
wasting the said water. Then the solytary retornyng to hy^ self / and
consyderyng ye virtue of ye same vysyon / called again the priest / and
mynystred to him as he did tofore.

In a monastery of relygyon were sometime two brethern ledyng a much fair and
holy life. Each of them by his merytes deserved to see and know his felawe to
be in the grace of god. And it happed on a time yt one of them on a friday in
the morning yssuyng out of his monastery saw a relygyous monk which ete
pryuely / and he asked hy^ in beholding hy^ how he ete seen yt it was not time
of etyng. On ye morn which was yt day in which after their custom yt they
song mass / he was in yt church with his brother and ye other relygyouses yt
which his brother in beholding knew the grace which god before had given him
was departed from hy^ / whereof he was much sorrowful. And when he was come in
his cell / he asked hy^ what thing he had done / saying to hy^ yt he had not
seen the grace of god in hy^ as he had tofore. To whom he answered yt he
supposed not to have co^mysed any ylle / neither in deed ne in thought / yet
again his brother asked hy^ / if he had spoken any idle word. And in Remembryng
himself of that he had said the day before say to him / yesterdaye I repreued
a relygyous man / whom I fond etyng in the morning / and I trow yt it be the
sin that I have co^mysed in as much as I have repreued hy^ without to know
what necessyte he had But I pray the my brother / that you wylt labor with me
in prayng god during these.xl. days yt he will pardone and forgive me my
sin. The which thing they did / and the said two wekes passed / the brother
saw the grace of god coming again upon his said brother / by the which they
were gretely conforted and thanked god.

Here follows an other treatise showing how one ought to have dyscrecyon.


THe holy abbot Anthonye said that some there be yt trauaylle and tourmente
their bodies by great and sharp abstynences. And said yt in so doing because
they had no discreco^n they deserved no merit against god. Some brethern came
on a time to hy^ for to tell to him some fantasyes which they had had / to
the end that he should say to them if they were true / or if they were mockes
of ye devil. Now had they at departing fro their hermytages / brought an
ass with them which was deed on ye way. The which thing forseen by saint
Anthonye before they arrived to him / he went again hem and axed of them / how
their ass was deed. Then in answeryng to him they asked how he might know
that he was deed. And he said to them yt the deuylles had showed to hy^ Then
they told to him that for the fantasyes that often came to them / of the which
the some were true / and the other not true / they were come to hy^ / to know
how they ought byhaue them to the end yt they might keep them fro error / of
which they held them content by thexample of the ass / by ye which he
showed to them yt such fantasyes comen of the devil.

An hunter on a time huntyng wild bestes in a foreste came and fond saint
Anthonye dysportyng with his relygyous dyscyples / whereof ye hunter was in
hy^self evil content. The which thing saint Anthonye wyllyng to show to hy^
yt sometime it is necessary to a prelate to condescende hy^ to his subgettis he
said that he should set his bolte in his bow / and draw his bow / which
he so did. And after he bad him draw depper his bow / and so he did / and
yet he bad hy^ draw more strongly. And as he would have drawn / he answered
hy^ / yt if he drew more than reason / he might well break his bow in pyeces /
then said to hy^ saint Anthonye / yt in like wise was it of them yt always
labored in ye service of god. for if ye brethern labored more than mesure /
anon they should be weary and trauaylled / and might not bear ye pain /
therefore it is need in like wise to forbere sometime rygour. The hu^ter heryng
these things was gretely touched with co^pu^cco^n / and prouffuted much by ye
words of saint Anthonye. And after departed and went his way / and his
relygyouses co^fermed in ye excercyte of virtues went in to their places.

A certain brother required thabbot Anthonye that he should pray to god for
him. To whom he answered / if thou have no charge ne besynes of thy self in
prayeng god that he keep the fro sin / he shall have no pity of the / ne more
shall I also.

An other time said the said saint Anthony of some folk that he knew to be
feeble and hertles. God suffers not this people here to have any war or
bataylles / because yt he knows yt they be feeble and may not be it.

Thabbot Euagrius said to thabbot Arsenye yt he meruaylled much / how it might
be / yt in so great a multitude of relygyouses as were there and yt had so
great science and Instrucco^n / and had no virtues. Saying furthermore that
the laborers and work men in Egypt were endowed with Infynyt virtues / and
said that many relygyouses were not virtuous / by cause they applied over
ententyfely them self to worldly things / but the laborers and work men of
Egypt had gotten the virtues by their own and propre labors.

The holy fader Arsenye said that a Relygyous stranger dwelling in a strange
prouynce / if he will be in rest and tranquyllyte / he ought not to entremete
with any worldly thing.

Thabbot Mark said to ye holy fader Arsenye that it was a good thing when a
Relygyous man takes some co^solaco^n in his celle. And that he had seen a
relygyous man / the which had but one oonly plant of a cool in his gardyn /
and he had plucked it up / to the end that he should not take thereof over
great pleasyr / or over great delectacyon. To whom the holy fader Arsenye
answered / that the holy fader Mark said well / how well that it is necessary
to some man to byhaue him self after his excercytaco^n. For if the same
person yt had dysplanted and pulled up the said cool / if he had not in hy^
this virtue to endure it / he had noon other thing to do / but to plant it
again.

Thabbot Peter which was dyscyple of thabbot Loath said yt he was on a time in
yt celle of yt holy fader Agathon where as came to hy^ a relygyous person
saying / that he had will to dwell with the relygyouses / and for ye cause he
prayed hy^ that he would say how he ought byhaue hy^ among them. To whom the
said fader answered / that it was necessary / that for the first day he
entered he should take such and so good manner of living / that he should never
change it / and that he should take in himself no trust of his works. The
holy fader Macharye to this purpose asked him / what does trust. To whom he
answered that it is lykeneth to the great hete / the which when it brenneth /
makes every man to flee from him. And also it corrupts ye fruytes of the
trees. Then said the holy fader Macharye / trust is an evil thing. The fader
Agathon answered / that it is no worse passion than is confyaunce / the which
is mother of all other passions And it is a thing couenable and necessary to a
relygyous person / that he apply him self to virtuous works / and that he
take not in hy^ self confyau^ce of the same works / how be it also yt he be
resydent allone in his celle.

We find that for the dyscrecyon of thabbot Agathon. Some desyryng to see him
and to experyment / if he were a man moderat and pacyent / and not subget to
anger or to ire / came and transported them to him / and said to hy^ many
Iniuryes in this manner. Thou art thabbot Agathon / and of the we have herd
say / that you art a great fornycatour / and replenysshed with all pride and
ambyco^n To whom he answered / it is true / where of it me dyspleaseth. After
they said to hy^ / you art Agathon / the great rayller full of Ryotous words
and of detracco^n And he yet answered yt he was so. And furthermore they said.
Thou art an heretyke / heryng the which Iniurye / he said without troublyng ne
moeuynge hy^ self in wrath / that he was none heretyke. And they seeing his
great pacyence / asked him wherefore he had suffered and endured so long so
great Iniuryes / as were the first / in confessyng them to be true. And he
had not in like wise suffered ye last Iniurye. To which askyng he answered /
that as to the regard of the said first Iniuryes he had attrybuted to himself
/ and was prouffyte to his soul to have endured they^. But as touching to the
last / by ye which they accused hy^ of ye right enorme sin of heresye /
consyderyng that this sin is the pryncypall yt departs a man from the
company of god. And that for nothing he would not be separate fro hy^ /
therefore he would not endure it. They heryng his right honest answer were much
meruaylled of his right great dyscreco^n / and departed from him much well
edyfyed.

The said abbot Agathon asked yt which labor was more great whether to keep
his body / or to keep his soul. He answered yt the body was lykened to a
tree. And said that to keep his body / was as much as to keep the leaves of
the tree. But to keep the soul is as much / as to keep the fruit. And
therefore it is written that every tree not beryng good fruit shall be hewn
down and put in the fire to brenne / it behooves us for the conseruaco^n of our
fruit to have besy solycytude of the keeping of our soul. And in so doing to
have co^stau^ce in our good thoughts and cogytacyons. Also always we have need
of couerture and ornement which is labor corporal.

Thabbot Agathon well dyscrete and sayge for well to entende and understand /
nothing slothful for to labor / and suffysaunt in all things. And much
strongly ententyfe and besy in labouryng with his poor hands / and much
sobre in etyng and vestymentis.

In a chapter general where as were assembled all the relygyouses of Sychye
for the determynacyon of a certain cause. After the delyberacyon of the same
came to them thabbot Agathon / which said to the said relygyouses / that they
had not well ordained. The which heryng these words said to him / who art you
that thus spekest. To whom he answered. I am the sone of a man. Certainly it is
written. O ye sons of men if ye speak verily Justice. Judge ye right wisely.

The said abbot Agathon said that if a man yracundyous were so virtuous that he
might reyse ye deed bodies yet it should not please god because of his ire.

On a time came to thabbot Achylles three old faders / among whom there was one
which was much obstynate in an ylle opinion. The other tweyne each after
other required the abbot Achylles that he would make a net for to fysshe / to
the end yt their monasterye should have remembrance of hy^. And he answered to
them yt he would none make That other after made to him like request. To whom
he answered / that gladly he should make it for him The other tweyne some what
having Indygnaco^n of that he had refused to make the said net / and
nevertheless he had condescended to make it to that other which was opynate.
And asked him / what had moeued him to make it sooner for him than for them. To
whom he answered. I have answered to you tweyne that I would not make it / and
that it was not my pleasyr / for as much as I know well / that ye be never
angry ne wroth. But to this man I have grant to make it / because that if I
had not accorded to him to make it. I should have given to him occasyon to say
yt by you or by other I had be aduertysed of his evil opinion / and for that
cause I have wylled to make to him the said net / and began to cut of the
cord for to make the said net to the end for to appease his courage / and that
he should not perysshe in that heaviness.

Some rehercen of an aged holy fader which had been during fyfty year without
etyng of any bread / and with out drink sauf a little water / the which said
that he had quenchyd and mortefyed in him fornycacyon / auaryce / and vain
glory The holy fader Abraham aduertysed that he had said these words / asked
hy^ if he had said them. The which answer / ye / and for to show that he
had evil said The same Abraham made to him such a demand. I put caas that
thou entrest in to thy celle. And in gooyng in thou foundest a woman upon thy
matte / Wenest thou to keep the well fro thynkyng what she is. To whom he
answered that / nay / But he should repugne well to his thought that he should
never touch her. Then said Abraham to him / then thou haste not slain
fornycacyon. For the passion is yet living / but it is bounden. And yet he said
to him / if in gooyng by the way thou saw stones and pyeces of pottes /
among the which thou saw and apperceyuedest some to be of fine gold / now
should it seem to the / that thou myghtest repute such and no better than the
stones. He answered nay / but he might well withstand it to his thought in
such manner / that he would not take ne gadre them. And furthermore Abraham
said to him / if it be reported to the of two brethern / that the one loves
the well / and speaks honestly of the / and that other hates the and has the
in evil will / and speaks evil in detraccyon of the and of thyn honor. I
ask the if they both came to the / sholdest you receive them egaly and with
like courage. He answered nay / but he would well co^strayn himself to do as
much good to him that would him evil / as to him that loved him well. And
then said the abbot Abraham / the passions lyuen yet / but they be some what
bounden and withdrawn by the strayt living of holy men. One of the holy faders
recou^ted that there was an old relygyous man living virtuously and labouryng
in his celle The which cladde him with a matte On a time he transported him
unto the holy man Ammon. The which seeing him to be cladde with a matte / said
to him that ye vesture was not hy^ vtyle ne prouffytable. The said relygyous
man said that he was much molested and trauaylled with three cogytacyons and
thoughts / the which he declared to hy^ to be such / that is to wit that it
constrained hy^ to depart from his place / and to go in to an hermytage. That
other was that it excyted hy^ to go in to a place so strange that none should
know him. And the third / that it admonested him to enclose hy^ in his celle
in such manner that he should not see any persene / and that from two days in
to two days he should not ete. To whom thabbot Ammon answered that it was not
expedyent to do any of the three things / but he cou^seylled him that he should
be resydent in his celle as he had be accustomed / and ete every day a little
/ having always in his heart the word of the publycan the which is contained
in the gospel / and that in so doing he may be saved Thabbot Danyell said /
that when a man shall keep his heart in verdure / he shall make his soul dry.
Furthermore said the same abbot Danyell that when the body is strongly
nourysshed it makes the soul to become dry / and when by abstynence it
becomes dry / it makes the soul to be well nourysshed. Yet reherceth the
said Danyell that the abbot Arsenye being in Sychye had a monk which always
stale and robbed that which the old faders had. The abbot Arsenye desiring
to keep him fro dooyng such theftes / to the end that he should not be fynably
dampened if he perseuered. Brought hy^ in to his celle saying to him / that he
should take all that were needful to him / and that he should give him leave to
take all / forseen always that he should no more stele ne rob any thing. And
in deed he gaaf to hy^ gold and silver / and all that he had in his power.
But nevertheless he could not give to him so much / that he could keep him
from stelyng. The old faders seeing that he would not amend ne keep him fro
stelyng / putting him out of their company in saying / if to any brother came
any bodily sekenes he must think on it and suffer it. But and if he be a
thief / and that he be warned to withstand him fro robbyng / and he will not
do it / It behooves to put him out. For he does the detryment of his soul.
And all they that dwell with him ben troubled with his vice.

Thabbot Euagrius at beginning of his conuersaco^n / transported him unto an
old fader / and required him that he would give to him some good Instruccyon
and to help him that he might be saved. The old fader answered to him / if
thou be with any persons / keep the from spekyng till thou be required.
Euagrius touched with conpunccyon by that word / repented him to have over
soon spoken. And said to the old fader / that he had read many books /
but he had not found such Instruccyon / and concluded to prouffyte well
therewith / and departed from him. The said abbot Euagrius said that three
things / that is to wit / often to read / to wake / and to pray god / yelden
steadfast and constante the thought that is wauerynge and erryng by vain
cogytaco^ns and thoughts. Furthermore he said that abstynence ob mete / labor
/ and business / lassen and maken cold the brennyng of concupyscence. And to
psalmodye with longanymyte / that is to say besyly and contynuaco^n in
virtuous works / and to have a pyteous heart. But he must do all these
things in time couenable and oportune / and by mesure and attemperaunce. For
if Inportunatly and without mesure they be done / they prouffyte not long. And
the things that little while endure / ben more noyous than prouffytable.

I habbot Effren passing on a time his way / at thynstygacyon of an evil
felawe / came after him a poor miserable common we man / and began to flatere
him / desyryng to draw him to consent to know her flesshely Or at less if
she might not make him to do so that she should provoke and moeue him to ire.
For never man law him thyde ne wroth to any person. And be seeing the said
woman approuchyng to him he said to her My friend come and follow after me /
and when they were in a place publyke and common where as much people
freque^ted / he called her and said that she should come to him / and so she
did. And then after said to her / now my friend lie down here to the end that
I do that which thou desyrest. She seeing the great multitude of people that
were there / said to him. Ha fair fader we be not in a place propyce to do it
/ seen the great multitude of people that is here / for here we should be
confounded. How my daughter answered the holy fader Effren / if thou have shame
that the men should see the / how much more ought you be ashamed to be seen
of god / which showed the things hid in derkenesse. She heryng these words
and all confused vaynquysshed by the same / returned without to accomplysshe
her dampnabell will.

On a time came to the abbot Zenon some brethern that asked him saying Fair
fader what sygnefye the words that be written in the book of Job / that is to
wit / that the heaven is not clean ne the world / as to the regard in the
presence of god. Then said the holy fader Zenon / that the brethren had
left their sins / and were curyous and besy to inquire of heavenly things.
As who should say / that it was a curyous demand and little necessary / and
that it had been to them more prouffytable to think on the edyfycacyon of
their conscyences. Nevertheless he said to them thynterpretacyon of the said
words in this manner That is to wit / because that god only is clean and not
defoyled with any vice For that cause it is said / that the heaven ne the world
be not clean in his presence / that is to say to the regard of his purete and
clennes.

Thabbot Theodore the ferme said if thou have amytye or frendshyp wish some /
the which yet by Inconuenyent or sin of fornycacyon / thou ought to
stratche thyn hand to him for to reyse him up if it be possible. That is to
say to enforce thy self by sweet or rygorous admonycyons for to make him leave
his sin / but if thou see him to be obstynate in rennyng in to any error in
the faith. And that he will not retrne to a good way / thou ought
Incontinent to cut of and cast away his amytye behind the / to the end that
parauenture by comenynge over long with him / he draw the not to the bottom
of the swolowe / that is to say to everlasting dampnacyon. The said abbot
Theodore came on a time to thabbot Johan which was a gheldyng of his natyuyte /
that is to say that he never had any genytours. And in spekyng to gydre / the
abbot Theodore said to him / when I was in the deserts of Sychye / the work
of the soul was our propre work / the work of our hondes was our propre
passing. As who would say that the hermytes or relygyouses that then were in
Sychye took head pryncypally and most long to orysons and contemplaco^ns. And
when sometime they labored with hondy works / it was oonly in passing a little
time for to eschew ydlenes. But presently the work of the soul / that is to
say all works vertuos and helthfull ben left and put a back / and entende
not to labor / but for thentenement of the body and to satysfye his
dysordynat concupyscence.

On a time an aeged fader came unto thabbot Theodore / and as all admeruaylled
said to him. Loo see one of our brethern / which is returned to the world.
To whom the said Theodore said / that he thereof ought not to meruaylle. But
when he herd say that any relygyous had so well withstanden the temptacyons
of the fend / yt had escaped without to be of him devoured / then he ought
to meruaylle. As if he had said / that it is a thing dyffycyle above all
other things / and worthy of great admyraco^n when a man how well that he be
virtuous can so much do that the devil may not do dampne him. Yet said the
said Theodore that many in this world have chosen temporal rest / by the
which words may be known that he would say to be Impossyble to have in this
world certain rest or consolaco^n temporal / without first to have rest in
his conscience.

On a time some ancient faders transported them to the hermytages of Sychye
with the which went the abbot Johan Naue. And it happed that in etynge on a
time to gydre one of the most auncyentes aroos which was a priest / the
which entremeddled to give to them that satte at table a little vessel
wherein was water for to take after their appetyte. But eueryche of them having
regard to the ancient of this holy fader / which was holden venerable /
refuseden to accept his service / reserved oonly thabbot Johan the little /
the which when it came to his turn / he presented to him the vessel / and
Incontynant he receyueded it / whereof the other meruaylled. And some said to
him that they were abashed much / how he which was lest of all / had
presumed to use the seruyse of one so notable a man. That is to say that he
is aeged and virtuous. To whom he answered in this manner. When I arise fro the
table for to give to my brethren water to drink. I rejoice me when they
drink all / to the end that I may get of god some reward. Now I receive his
water and accept his seruyse / to the end that I be cause that he deserve some
merit. And also to the end that he be not some what angry / if he had not some
of us / that would have his seruyse acceptable. And when he had so said / they
meruaylled all of his dyscrecyon.

The abbot Pastor axed on a time thabbot Joseph in demaundyng him when some
temptacyons assayllen a person / if he ought at beginning withstand them /
or if he ought to luster them in to his thought. To whom the holy fader
answered / that he should late them enter / and after he should fight with
them and withstand them. Anon after the abbot Pastor returned in to Sychye
where as he made his resydence. And certain time after a Relygyous man comen
fro Thebayde in to Sychye in speaking of thabbot Joseph to some Relygyouses /
said that he had asked him / how he ought to conduyte him in his temptacyons
/ and if he ought promptely resyste and withstand them / or else receive
them and fight against them. And that the said Joseph had said that he should
keep him that he received them not / but Incontynente to cast them fro him.

Then the abbot Pastor herynge these words of the said relygyous person /
and knowing that the said abbot Joseph had counseylled him to do the
contrary / departed fro Sychye / and went to Panese where as the said Joseph
held them. And when he had arrived and entresalued each other. The said
Pastor said to him such words. My brother I shall say to the wherefore I am
come here. I have great desire to see the / and with this thou know I have
manyfested to the some of my cogytaco^ns and thoughts. And I demand of the
on a time / if to the temptacyons that comen to me. I ought incontinent resyste
and withstand them in castyng them behind me / or if I in any wise ought to
receive them / and then after to cast them fro me. To which thou saydest
and answeredest / that I should not redyly cast them fro me / but should
receive them and after that I had foughten against them to cast them fro me.
Now I have sythyn well herd say of one of our brethern of Sychye coming fro
the / that thou haste counseylled him all otherwise to do. Therefore I am comen
to know of the that thou say to me for to content my fantasye. Then thabbot
Joseph said to him. My brother thou know that I love the / certainly that
do ye answered Pastor / when ye requyredest me to give the counseyll in this
matter Vnderstodest thou not that I gaaf to the as I would have given to my
self Certainly yes said Pastor. Certainly said Joseph. Mine advise is such /
yt if thou or I gaaf place to temptaco^ns when they assaylled us / and after
that we fight against them / then we have the more merit / than if
inco^tynent we cast them away without to fight against them. In thus dooyng we
be the more proeued / and therefore I spack and counseylled the as I would have
done to my self / but every man has not the constau^ce to mow withstand the
temptaco^ns when they deliver to them over great entree. Therefore to him / to
whom I said the contrary. I said it for his most surete / and by cause I
knew hy^ not ne what strength he had.

The said abbot Pastor said yt on a time that he transported him self in to
the low parties of Eracleos unto the said abbot Joseph / the which had in his
monasterye a much fair fygge tree. And on a frydaye in the morning the said
Joseph and Pastor deuysyng together / the said Pastor beheld ye said fygge
tree. And Joseph said to him yt he should ete of the fygges yt there were But by
cause it was fasting day / he would not ete. Nevertheless he prayed him in
the name of god that he would tell to him the cause wherefore he wylled hy^ to
ete / seen that it was fasting day. And how be it that he ete not as said is /
nevertheless yet he was ashamed that he had not do yt the said Joseph had
commanded him doubtyng to have done evil in as much as he had not obeyed to
his comau^dement / ymagynyng yt he had done it without cause. Thabbot Joseph
answered hy^ that the old faders at the beginning had not acustome to
command the young relygyouses any thing / that it were lawful to do / but to
the contrary commanded them to do things that seemed to be vnprouffytable and
not decente ne couenable. And when they saw yt they were ready to do all ye /
which was commanded to them were it good or evil Then they commanded
they^ nothing but yt which was reason. And so ought they to do because they
knew yt in all thing they were obeyssau^t.

A brother asked the said abbot Joseph in demau^dyng him what he had to do upon
yt which he said / that he might not bear any temptaco^ns / ne labor / ne
give alms. Thabbot answered him if you may not do any of these things at
the lest keep thy conscience clean from all evil toward thy neighbors / and
in this manner you shall be saved. For god axeth no thing but the soul without
sin.

Thabbot Ysaac of Thebayde deffended his brethern / yt they should not bry^g
any childern in to their monastery / sayng yt in Sychye by thoccasyon of
childern.iiij. chirches had been deserted. Thabbot Longyn said on a time to
thabbot Lucius yt he had three thought ye grieved hy^ / that one was yt he went
in to an strange country. And the said Lucius answered to hy^ / if you reteyne
not thy tongue / in what someuer place yt you ghost you shall not be a stranger
/ but if you refrain it you shalt be there a pilgrim / After the said Longyn
said to hy^ The second admonesteth me to fast two days contynuell without
etyng. The holy fader answered to him. Certainly my brother / when by force of
fasting you becomest so crooked that thy head boweth to thy fete. Yet for all
that shall not thy fasting be agreeable to god / if it be not done with a pure
entencyon / then is it need to make such fastings as ben agreeable to god
and to keep the fro evil thoughts. Yet again said thabbot Longyn. That other
thought is that I keep me from hauntyng with the men. And the said Luctus
answered to him / if thou can not correct thy life in co^uersyng with other.
In like wise you can not correct thy self living allone solytaryly.

Thabbot Macharye said if we put in our remembrance / that is to say / if we
forgete not / and pardonne the offenses that been done to us by the men we take
away and cut fro our thought the virtue to have remembrance of our lord.
But if we have remembrance of the euylles yt the deuylles excyten us / we
shall be virtuous and Inuyncyble. Thabbot Mathoys said that ye devil knows
not by what passion or sin he may pryncypally overcome or subdue the soul.
And therefore he sows in us evil thoughts / but he can not take them away
again. Sometime be sows fornycacyons / and semblably other passions. And in ye
wherein he sees the soul to be most enclyned then most ardau^tly he
mynystreth that to hy^. But if he knew certainly the temptaco^n to which the
soul should be most enclyned / be should not admynyster to hy^ so many
temptaco^ns. Some rehercen of thabbot Nathere which was dyscyple of thabbot
Syluayn / which made resydence in his celle in the mount Syna / he lived only
with things which were necessary for his body. But after that he was made
bishop of the Cite of Pharan / he made much more abstynence than he had do
before / the which thing seeing his dyscyple said to him. My lord when we were
in the deserts / we tourmented not our bodies by strayt and hard afflyccyons
like as we do now. To whom he answered / when we made in thermytage our
dwelling / we were in a place solytary and in rest. And for yt cause I would
well govern my poor body to the end that I ran in to no sekenes. But now
we ben in the world / conuersyng with worldly things / where we have moo
occasyons to sin than we had before / the which it behooves necessaryly to
cut of and cast away / wherefore it is need to us to live the more sobrely.
And on that other part if of adventure I were seek. I should find here /
which should better help me / than I should in thermytage / by which I shall
not lose the purpose of relygyon.

A brother dwelling in an hermytage nygh unto thabbot Pastor / said to him on a
time / that he was sore troubled / and that he would forsake his place and go
in to an other. Thabbot Pastor demanded him what moeued him to do so. He
answered that he herd say of a brother being there some things / by which
he was not well edyfyed. Thabbot answered to him yt they were not true / he
replied to him again that they were. For the brother which had reported them
to hy^ was verytable and true. Thabbot said yet again that the relygyous was not
true / for if he had be such / he had never reported such things. our lord
hery^g ye voys of ye sodomytes cryeng to hy^ for their sy^ne would not believe it
/ but descended and would see it with his eyes. The relygyous answered ye right
so he had seen it. Thabbot Pastor hery^g these words / began to look on ye
ground / and took up a straw / and askyng hy^ what it was yt he held / ye
relygyous said yt it was a straw. After he looked up on hye toward ye couery^g
of his celle / and lokyng shewde to him a balke or a beme / and he asked hy^
what it was. And he answered yt it was a balke yt sustained ye weight and
charge of ye celle. Then said to hy^ thabbot. My brother hardyly set in thyn
heart and believe yt thy sins be such and also heavy as is ye balke / and the
sins of whom you spekest synystryly ben like and as light as the straw. Sysoy
heryng this word was much admeruaylled of his great dyscreco^n and said to
him. Holy fader as much as I may I bless and praise the. Certainly thy words
ben virtuous as precious stones.

On a time prestes of ye relygyon came in to a monastery nygh by / in which
also was thabbot Pastor. And thither came thabbot Anub / ye said to hy^ yt he
should pray thoo prestes to take with them in charity such as god had given to
them. Thabbot Pastor being long without meuy^g hy^ or to make to hy^ any
answer. Then ye said abbot Anub was angry and went out of ye monastery they
yt were by ye said abbot Pastor axed wherefore he had give none answer to
thabbot Anub / because said he yt I have no cause so to do / ye know well yt I
am deed / and a man yt is deed speaks not / and therefore though I be here with
you / ye ought not to repute me living. A relygyous of a monastry of thabbot
Pastor went on a time a pylgremage / and arrived in a place where as dwelled a
solytary relygyous / the which was much loved of all them there about. And
for his virtues came often for to vysyte hy^. The same brother in dyuysyng with
him / received to hy^ some of the virtues of the said Pastor. And for that
cause the said relygyous desired sore to see him. And after the said relygyous
was returned in to his monasterye which was in Egypt. Certain time after /
the said solytarye man departed for to go thither / and so long walked that he
came in to ye place / where that ye other relygyous had told him where he
should find him. And when ye said relygyous saw the solytary monk / he was
much Joyous and made to him good chere. And after the said solytary monk
prayed hy^ for saint charity that he would show to him his abbot Pastor /
which he did and brought hy^ unto his said abbot saying to him. O venerable
fader loo here is a solytary relygyous man / which in his prouynce is much
honored and praised of all men / ye which desyryng to see the for ye good
reno^mee yt he has herd of the is come^ oonly hither to see yt. After yt they
were entresalued / thabbot Pastor received hy^ Ioyously / and after they had
rested they^ togydre / began ye said solytary to speak of holy scripture and of
spyrytuell and heavenly things / but thabbot Pastor gaaf to hy^ none answer /
and ye solytary relygyous seeing yt he spak not / all wroth departed from hy^
And to ye brother yt had brought him thither said in this manner. I have well
taken in vayn and for naught this way yt I am comen to this holy fader for to
see him and to speak with hy^ / and that he dayneth not to speak to me. The
relygyous heryng ye co^playnt of ye other / transported hy^ self to the said
abbot Pastor and said to hy^. Fader abbot this notable relygyous which has so
great a fame in his country is comen hither for to see yt and you wylt not
speak to hy^. Thabbot answered to him. I am not a man for to speak to him / he
speaks not but of bye and of heavenly things. And I which am a man can not
speak but of low and erthely things / if he had spoken of ye passions of the
soul / certainly I should w^ll have answered hy^ / but to hye and spyrytuell
questyons I can not answer for I know them not. The brother after yt he had
herd this answer / returned to ye other solytary man / and said to by yt the
abbot Pastor said to him. He then touched of co^puncco^n / returned unto the
said abbot / and axed him what thing he had for to do / of yt his passions
surmou^ted him. Thabbot beholding by said. Now you art right welcome / now I
shall open my mouth to the And if I can any good word I shall say it unto
the. Fynably after many fructuous colaco^ns between them said The said
solytary relygyous fond hy^ self well edyfyed / began to say. Certainly I
have founden here the right way of charity. And in gyuyng graces and
thankynges to god which had given to hy^ the grace to see one so holy a man /
returned in to his regyon.

An other brother said on a time to thabbot Pastor that he had co^mysed a great
sin / for the which he would bear penance during three year. The holy fader
said to hy^ / that it was much Then said the brother / command you yt I do
it oonly one year / he answered like as he did tofor that it was much They
that were present at these words sayden yt it suffysed unto.xl. days The holy
fader yet said that it was much / and furthermore said. I believe yt if a man
repent him with a contryte heart / and yt after his repentance he do no more
thing whereof he ought to repent / yt god shall receive his penance how be it
that it be but three days.

Thabbot Amon required on a time yt he should say to hy^ what cou^seyl was
best to give for to eschew dyshonest thought / and ye desires ye engendren in
ye heart of a man. Thabbot Pastor axed by manner of answer / yt is to wit you if
the axe may gloryfye hyself of his cuttynge / but if it were put to work and
if there were not mynystred to it wode for to be hewn and cut. Certainly said
he no. And in like wise may be said of folysshe thought and desires dysordynat
/ if you give to them no matter obtemperyng to ye same / they may not overcome
the.

A like askyng made thabbot Esaye to the said abbot Pastor / to whom he said
thus. As a cross full of vesteme^t / if it be long kept without openyng / ye
said vestement shall rote and destroyed Right so folysshe thought / which
engendren in our heart / if we acco^plysshe them not by succession of time /
they shall mynusshe and come to naught.

Thabbot Joseph asked on a time ye abbot Pastor of ye same thing / to who^ he
answered / ye like as a serpent enclosed in his cave / or a scorpyon in a
vessel stopped by long time ben suffocate and slain / in like wise the evil
thought is the which by ye subtylyte of ye evil fend of hell ben grown and
multyplyed / a little and little they dymynysshe by ye pacyence of hy^ yt
suffers them / in resystyng them with all his courage.

Thabbot Johan asked of thabbot Pastor how he byhaued hy^ in fasting And he
answered to hy^ / that he yt would fast / ought every day to withdraw a
little of his mete / in such manner yt he should not be full. And then the
abbot Joseph said to him. Then when you were young you fastest not two days
without to ete every weke. The holy fader answered. Believe me if you wylt. I
have fasted two days / and three days / and a weke all hooll. But ye old
faders have assayed and proeued all these things. And they have fond / that
it is a good thing to ete every day ones and a little less. And they have
showed to us this regulier way which is most facyle and light.

The said abbot Pastor said that a relygyous ought not to dwell in a place /
where he sees any to have evil will against him / for he shall not co^ne
prouffyte there.

A brother came to thabbot Pastor and said yt he should labor and sow his
field that he had. And the grain and corn that he should gadre / he should
dystrybute it to ye poor people. The holy fader answered hy^ / that he did a
right good work / and so departed with this good purpose / and was besy to do
more alms than he had done before. The abbot aduertysed of this thing asked
of thabbot Pastor / if he fered not that god should be angry with hy^ for to
have counsel him so to do / because yt hy^ seemed yt in suffryng him so to
labor / he departed hy^ fro his propre vocaco^n. which was for to pray to
god. Thabbot Pastor heryng these words said nothing. And two days after he
sent to ye brother and made hy^ to come to him. To whom in ye presence of ye
abbot Anub he spoke in this manner. My brother what thing was it yt you askedest
of me yt other day / when I thought on other thing. The relygyous said to hy^.
Fair fader I said to the / yt I labored and sewe a field yt I have / and yt
the grayn and corn that I gadred thereof. I dystrybuted to the poor people.
Then said to hy^ ye abbot Pastor. I suppose yt in so saying you had spoken
in the person of thy brother / which is a lay man. Certainly to do so is not
the work of a monk. He then heryng these words was much angry and said. I
can do none other work. And I can not keep me fro sowyng of my field. These
words said he returned. Thabbot Anub heryng his answer was much
dyspleasaunt of yt he had said / and said to thabbot Pastor. O my brother I
pray the to pardo^ne me. The said abbot Pastor answered to hy^. That time yt
the relygyous spoke to me of this matter. I knew and co^sydered well / yt this
work was not couenable to a relygyous man / but I answered to hy^ after the
good affection of his courage / the which I had excyted to the prouffyt of
saint charity. Now he is returned heavy and always he does the said work.

The said Pastor said if a man have co^mysed any sin / and he denied saying I
have not done it and thou repreuest hy^ not. In so doing ye brekest his good
courage / but if you say to hy^. My brother be not angry. And keep yt from
hensforth from doing evil / you ought with this to excyte his courage to do
penance. Also the said holy fader said ye experyence is a good thing / for by
yt ben the men after more constant and the more steadfast He said furthermore
when a man techeth and warns any man to do a thing / that he will not do it
him self / he is like a pytte ye refresshyth all them that come to him / and
yt with his water wassheth and makes clean all ordure and fylthe / but he
purges not him self / and is full of fylth and uncleanness. Also he said that
he is a man yt knows him self. Item he said yt if three men ben togydre / of
which that one is in rest / that other is seek and thanketh god / and the
third admynystreth to ye other two with pure and clean will / these three ben
as of one courage. Item he said ye shrewdenesse puts out never other
shrewdenesse. And therefore if one do to ye harm / you ought to do well to hy^
/ to the end yt thy good deed destroy his malice. Item he said yt ye relygyous
that is full of noise / is no monk. He yt rendryth and does evil for evil /
is no monk. And he that is yrous and angry is no monk.

A brother on a time came to ye said abbot Pastor and said to hy^ ye many
cogytaco^ns and thoughts came in his courage / which made hy^ almost to
perysshe Then thabbot made to despoyle hy^ all naked and set hy^ in the
plain air and after said to him yt he should opene a broad his bosom / and
take the wind. To whom he answered that he might ne could do it. Then said
the holy fader / if thou may not do that / no more may you defend the fro
ye thoughts and cogytaco^ns / but yt they will assail the. But it is in thy
power to withstand them.

An other brother came and asked him how he should dyspose him of an heritage
that was left to him / he answered to him. Go thy way / and come again within
three days / and I shall tell the what you shall do. The three days passed he
came again to the holy fader / like as he had ordained. Then he said to him /
what shall I say to the / if I say to the / give it to the church / the
mynystres of the same shall make good chere therewith. If I say to the / give
it to thy kynnesmen and friends you shall have no reward ne retrybucyon. But if
I say to the that you give it to the poor people / thou shall dyspose it
surely. Goo thy way then and do that thou wylt.

A brother asked of the abbot Pastor if he saw any thing / that is to wit / if
he ought to speak / he andswered to him that it is written / he that speaks of
any thing to fore yt he has herd it he is a fooll / and renneth in to repreef
and vylonnye. Therefore if thou be asked then speak / and if not / hold thy
peace. The said holy fader said furthermore that thabbot Amon said yt there is a
man which all the time of his life bare an are / and may no hew down the
tree. And there is an other that has ye usage to hew / and with a few strokes
he smyteth down ye tree / by which are he understands dyscreco^n.

An other brother askyng the said abbot Pastor / sayng yt he suffered in dwelling
with his abbot the great hurt of his soul / and asked hy^ whether he ought to
dwell and abide with him. Thabbot Pastor knowing that his abbot did to him
wrong / meruaylled hy^ of that the Relygyous asked him if he ought longer
dwell with him / to whom he answered / if you wylt / abide there. The which
answer herd / he departed fro the said Pastor / and returned and dwelled
with the said abbot as he did before / And after he returned again to ye said
Pastor and said to him that it grieved his soul. Nevertheless the said Pastor
answered nothing to him / wherefore yet he returned again to his abbot. Fynably
he came the third time / and said to the holy fader / that he would abide no
longer with him. And then the holy fader Pastor answered to him. My sone you
have done thy devour. Go thy way and be no longer with him / in saying
furthermore / that a man that sees his soul to be in danger / ought not to
ask what he ought to do for to eschew it / when he sees clearly that he may
do it. Sometime some inquire of the aeged faders things doubtous and derke for
to know / that which they know well / and for to be the better edyfyed of
their conuersaco^ns. But of the open sins / they ought not to ask / but they
ought incontinent to destroy and throw them behind them.

Abraham which was dyscyple of ye abbot Agathon / asked of thabbot Pastor in
demau^dyng him / whereof it proceeded yt the deuylles foughten so strngly / to
whom the holy fader Pastor answered. Say you that the deuyls fight with us /
when we acco^plysshe our evil wylles / for our evil wylles ben the deuyls ye
trouble and tormente us to the end that we accomplysshe them.

A brother asked the abbot Pastor in demau^dyng hy^ / how a relygyous man ought
to keep redydence in his celle or habytaco^n. To whom he answered for to keep
resydence in his celle as to that may be known and spoken openly / is none
other thing but to labor with his hondes / ete ones on ye day / to keep
scylence and to take conte^placo^n in heavenly works / but to prouffyte in ye
same preuyly and secretly / is yt every man have dread of god / shame to fore
hy^ whersomeuer he go / and in such wise to keep and observe ye hours of his
service te^porall / yt in this doy^g he be not neclyge^t to thy^ke on
spyrytuell things. And if it hap ye one have not to do in some handy work.
It byhoueth him for teschewe ydlenes to put hy^self in ye seruyse of god and to
employe the time without any perturbaco^n. And ye conclusyon of all these
things is to seche the company of good and devout relygyous persons living
and conuersyng holyly / and flee the company of them that been evil and
shrewes.

Two Relygyous persons came on a time unto thabbot Pambo that one of them
asked hy^ saying. Fair fader I fast two days together in the weke / and ete
not but two little myches baken under the ashes. Semest thou that in thus
dooyng I shall be saved / or if I be deceived and begyled. And that other
brother said to him. I get by the labor of my hands every day two pens / of
which I reteyne that one for my living / and that other I dystrybute in
alms / ought I be saved / or am I deceived. And after these words they
prayed hy^ affectuously yt he would give them an answer. Nevertheless he would
not do it. Four days after the said two brethern relygyous having will to
depart and go fro hy^. Some of the clerks and dyscyples of ye said abbot
Pambo / prayed them yt they would not be dyspleased of yt their abbot had not
answered to their askynges / and that god should reward them. And ferthermore
they said yt his custom was such / that he spoke not lightly / if god had not
Inspyred hy^ what he should say. Then at their departing they entered in to
the celle of ye said abbot Pambo / and in taking of hy^ leave / they recomau^ded
them to his holy faderhede / in prayeng him / yt it might please hy^ to pray
god for them. Then he axed them if they would depart / and they answered
ye. And in beholding them in his mind / and co^syderyng their works he began
to write in ye earth in saying these words. Pambo fasted two days hole in the
weke / and eteth two little loves baken in the ashes / is he therefore a monk /
nay and after he wrote saying Pambo receives of his works.ij pens and
dystrybuteth in alms / is he therefore a monk / certainly nay. And after yt he
was still a little he said to them that the works yt they did were good But
if they kept their conscyences against their neighbors in so doing they should
be saved. And with these words yt said relygyous being well edyfyed / departed
and returned in great Joy An other brother Relygyous asked the said abbot Pambo
/ how he might do yt the evil spyrytes / yt is to say the deuylles of hell
defended him to do any good work to his neighbors. To whom ye holy fader
answered / yt he should say no more so / for in tho words he made god a liar /
but he said to hy^ absolutely these words I will not do mercy / and said that
god purueyeng for our caas against the said enemies of hell / had said these
words. That is to wit. I have given to you power to march upon the serpent
and scorpyons / and to trede them under your fete. And in like wise I have
given to you power upon the strength of thenemye. Then said the holy fader to
the Relygyous / why defoulest not yt the stynkyng and foul enemies.

Thabbot Paladius said yt it is of necessyte / that ye soul yt will live and
co^uerse according to the will of Ihesu christ / to learn in the faith tho
things which he knows not / and also yt he show and teache manyfestly yt
which he had learned. And if ye soul do not eueryche of these two things
there as she may do it / it may be said of such a soul yt she is withholden
with a maladye enraged. For ye first pryncypall and beginning to depart hy^
self fro god / is to have ennoye and greuau^ce to show and teache ye good yt
he can. And when we have appetyte that the soul always love god.

An other relygyous axed of thabbot Sysoy wherefore it was yt his passions might
not depart from hy^. To whom the holy fader answer / yt it was because that
the vessellys of the same passions were within hy^ / as who should say he
received them over lightly. And furthermore he answered hy^ that he should
give to them their wages ye they were worthy to have / and they shall goo
their way.

Saint Syncletyce said yt they which by great labors / and in peril of the sea gadre and assemble te^porall rychesses and have great things. Then they
desire to get yet more and repute little or nothing that they have. And ye
worse is they set all their intent and affecco^n to have and get thoo
things yt they have not. But we our self which ought to enforce us to
prouffyte in relygyon / have no charge or business of things that is to say
of virtues yt we ought to get / and also we will not possess them which ben
to us necessary for to get yt love of our lord. Yet said yt good lady
Syncletyce yt ye there be two manner of heuynesses / yt one is to the soul vtyle
and prouffytable / that other corrupts and is right do^megeable. Then ye
heaviness which is prouffytable is that / wha^ by cause of our sins we wayle
and weep for them / and for thyngnorau^ce of our neighbors / and also in
feryng yt we fall not fro our good purpose / to the end yt we may come to ye
perfecco^n of all bound / and this is ye very spece of heaviness. That other
heaviness ye corrupts the soul / is that which ye fend sends to us
without any reason / yt which tholde faders call it ennoye or greuau^ce / and
therefore it is necessary to us to cast it away with all dylygence / in making
to god contynuell prayers psalmodyes and orys^^s. Yet said ye holy lady
Syncletyce / that ye fend by his evil cautell excyteth sometime them that been
conte^platyfe to make great and inmoderate abstynences. And otherwhyle he
puts in to their ymagynaco^n yt which is but reasonable / to be hard and
dyffycyle to bear / when then we will dyscerne thabstynence dyuyne and
wholesome fro ye which is tyra^nyke and dyabolyke / we ought to observe and keep
ye things / that is to wit / that in all time we have one vnmutable rule in
fasting / and that we determyne not suddenly to fast four or five days
co^tynuell / and after we to fill ye belly with great multitude of metes / for
that rejoices much strongly our enemy and adversary ye devil / for always
that which is done without mesure / gooth to corrupco^n / let us not then
suddenly cast away our armor / to the end that we be not found naked in the
bataylle / and by this nakedness taken lightly and put to death. Now our armor
ben our bodies / and ye knight is our soul / wherefore it behooves us to be
dylygent and keep us yt we be ready to socour that one and that other.

On a time two old faders camen fro ye parties of Peluse unto ye abbess Sarre
/ and in coming thither they said that it was need to meke theymself / yt is to
say / to purpose to her some words which should give to her cause of
humylyte. They then arrived to her in deuysyng together ye one of them tweyne
said to her / yt she should take heed and be well ware / that she enhau^sed ne
lift up her self in her courage / and that she should not be proud in
auau^tyng sayng yt to her which was a woman were comen solytary relygyouses.
To whom prudently she answered that how be it yt she was a woman of sex
femenyne / nevertheless she had ye courage of a man as she would say yt she was
not so indyscrete for tenhau^ce her self by over much vau^terye. And morouer
ye said abbess said to them / if I required of god yt every man should have
of me good reputaco^n either were of me well edyfyed. I should do so much yt I
would be found doing penance tofore their yates / but I seche not this vain
glory / but pray god yt my courage and my works be reputed of little
estymaco^n against all men. Thabbot Ypericius said yt he is verily wise yt by
his works / and not by worded ensygneth and techeth other. On a time came a
noble man of Rome and be came and made hy^self relygyous in a church of Sychye
/ which had had tofore a palace much greatly reno^med / and had a servant
which mynystred to hy^ his necessytees. The priest having ye pryncypall
mynystraco^n of ye same church / co^syderyng yt this relygyous man had be in
his time delycatly nourysshed / was dylygent to send to hy^ such good as god
had sent to hy^ / or had brought to ye church. And as he had dwelled and ben
resydent in Sychye by ye space of.xxv. year he becam a man conte^platyf
dyscrete and well rendermed. Then it happed yt one of ye relygyouses of Egypt
among other well famed / heryng ye reno^me^ of ye said relygyouses came for to
see him hopyng to see hy^ right hard and sharp life. The which in entryng in
to his celle / humbly salewed hy^ / and after their prayers made like as was
their custom / they rested and satte together / ye relygyous of Egypt seeing
hy^ cladde with vestyment more soft and better than were ye other relygyouses
/ and himself had but a matte of Ionkes / and an hyde or skyn upon hy^ a
little quysshon of grass under his head / and his fete bare with small hosen /
he was in himself astonyed / because yt ye other relygyouses of ye place had
not be accustomed in such wise to live but hadde^ always done and born / as
yet and bare more sharp and rigorous abstyne^ce The relygyous Romayn having ye
grace of conte^placo^n and preuydence knew thestymaco^n yt ye relygyous of
egypt had of hy^ / and said to his servant yt he should make ready some manner
mete well dressed for to feste the holy fader yt was come thither / the which
servant in obeyng his master set on ye fire a few cool word yt he had /
wha^ they were soden and hour co^petent was come^ for to take their refecco^n /
they took suffycyently enough and dronken wyn / then the said Romayn was
pourueyed for to sustain his body which was enfebled by sekenes / ye even
come^ they psalmodyed.xij. psalms / and after they slept / and at mydnyght in
like wise they psalmodyed / ye relygyous of egypt arysyng erly in ye morning
and taking his leave of ye relygyous Romayn said to hy^. My fader to god I
command the / and so departed not well edefyed of ye said Romayn / and as he
was a little wc drawn / ye said romayn wyllyng to take away fro ye relygyous
egypcyen ye synystre opinion ye he had of hy^ sent for hy^ again by his servant
/ and wha^ he was returned / he received hy^ in great Joy. After he asked hy^
of what prouynce he was and of what cite / to whom he a^swered yt he was of ye
prouynce of egypt / but he had be in no cite / and after he axed hy^ of what
craft he was before he was relygyous and in what place he dwelled / and he
answered yt he kept ye feldes and kept resyde^^e there / he axed hy^ also where
he slepte / and he a^swered in ye feldes / he axed more upon what bed he lay
/ whereto he a^swered / where should I take a bed wha^ I was in ye feldes / as
who says he had none to lie on / and he axed then how he slept / and he
a^swered upon ye bare earth / yet he axed what mete he ete and what wyn he
dra^ke / and he a^swered as tofore / what mete and dry^ke should a man find in
ye feldes / how lyuest you then said ye Romayn. The egypcyen said I ete dry
bread and if I ete any shalt thing. I drank water / then said the Romaym ye
this was a great labor / and yet he axed of hy^ if he had any bayne wherein he
might wasshe hy^ / and he said nay / but when he would wasshe hy^ it was in a
river wha^ he would. And after yt ye old Romayn had known of ye said
relygyous of egypt / all ye things aforsayd / as well the manner of his first
lyuy^g as of his labor / wylly^g to prouffyte with hy^ / told to hy^ ye life
ye he lived ye time yt he was seculer / in saying thus. My brother I will well
notefye to you how I miserable sinner whom you see am born in ye great
reno^med cite of rome / and in the same have had a great name in the palace of
the emperor. The which words heryng thegypcien was in his heart touched with
great co^puncco^n / co^syderyng yt ye life yt he ladde was much dyfferent from
yt which he had ladde before / and with great cure and besyues he herd ye
other things yt he said yt which also said to hy^ yt he had had in Rome great
and magnyfyke rychesses as well in houses su^ptuouses as other possessions and
revenues / gold silver and Infenyte moeuable goods / and in co^tynuyng and
habou^dyng in ye said goods was comen and had yolden himself in yt little
celle and in ye solytary place where he was. Furthermore he said to hy^ / yt he
had had beds apparaylled and ^orned with gold / and garnysshed with rich
couertures / for the which god had given to hy^ this lytyl couche of Ionkes
which yt he had / and the hyde or skin wherupn he rested. But instead of
his robes and vestyme^^ which were wont to be rich and right precious / he
used poor and simple habyleme^t wherewith he was clad. In his dyners and
bankettes he dyspended and consumed great so^mes of money / and instead of
the^ he used herbs and cooles / and drank a little cup of wyn he had also a
great sequely and rowte of worldly and galau^t seruau^tis / instead of whom
our lord had enspyred one oonly of his servants to mynystre and serve hy^ /
and instead of sole^pne baynes in which he had be accustomed to bayne in / he
weesshe his feet in a little water / and also used small hosen / for to support
a little ye maladye yt he had in his legs / And furthermore instead of floy^
harpes / melodyous Instrume^^^ / and delycyo^s songs of musyke / in which he
much delyted in his diverse and ba^ket^ / he psalmodyed on ye day.xij. psalms
/ and in ye night in like wise as so much / and for penance of his sins
passed / he took but little rest / which he reputed to be vnprouffytable
service to god / and when he had said all these things / he prayed humbly the
relygyous egypcyen / yt seen his Infyrmyte and maladye / yt in hy^ he should
not be slau^dred. The egypcyen heryng these things and consyderyng his life
and celle after the said holy fader romayn / began to say. Alas to me my
serable wretch where shall I bycome / when I behold my life / and thy life you
holy man. I find it much and greatly dyfferente / for in leuyng ye
trybulaco^ns and great labors yt I bear and endure in the world I am come to
come solytary in relygyon / where I have found more rest than trauayll / and I
have now yt I had not tofore / yt is to wit a peasyble and casy life without
any greuau^ce. But you romayn thy self by propre will have forsaken Infenyte
pleasances and worldely delectaco^ns / art come to life in this relygyous life
/ which shall seem to worldly people / to be to ye great trybulaco^n / for as
much as instead of ye said pleasau^ces and delectaco^ns / you have chosen to
live in humylyte and pouerte. These words said / ye said relygyous egypcyen
much well edyfyed of hy^ / and for his prouffyte came after oftymes to vysyte
him knowing that he was a man of great prudence / and that could well dyscerne
ye things doubtous / as he that was full of the grace of the blessed holy
ghost. An old fader said yt it was not of necessyte to use so many words / as
men use now presently / but ye works ben necessaryly required / that is to say
/ yt it be houeth not so much to seche and search ye words which have not
fruit / but the works which ben profitable and fruytful A young relygyous man
axed sometime of ye old relygyous faders / if any was pollute / wha^ he thought
or dremed some foul thought or dyshoneste. To ye which askyng / after yt ye
said holy faders had long dysputed among they^ some said ye / and some said
nay / alledgy^g / that if each man ye thought such things was pollute / they
yt be ygnorau^tes and ydiot^ / and to whom oftymes cou^^ many te^ptaco^ns with
great dyffyculte shall mow be saved. But they sayden to be a thing much
helthfull / wha^ in thynkyng on vycyous things / it be resysted with all his
force in such manners that it be not bodily acco^plysshed. The brother which
made this askyng heryng their dyfferent answers / the which seemed not to be
suffysau^t for to content hy^ / he went to an other holy fader better
approuued / whom he prayed to be by hy^ a certain of ye troth of this thing.
The holy fader answered to hy^ / that every person after his mesure shall
re^dre acompte before he shall be rewarded. By this answer the brother being in
more doubt tha^ he was before / prayde hy^ ye more largely he would expowne it
to hy^ / then ye holy fader expowned it to hy^ by such a symylytude. There
were two Relygyouses of whom ye one was more virtuous than ye other / and
departed fro their monasterye for to go to do some of their affairs / and it
happed yt the more virtuous man in passing his way or otherwise found a fair
vessel of gold / which was so rich and so precious yt for ye great richesse
and precyosyte he was tempted to take it and bear it away / but nevertheless
the relygyous for the great virtue yt was in hy^ promptly and without great
dyffyculte a^ paynt threw and rejected the said te^ptaco^n / and took not ye
said vessel / certainly notwithstanding that he had be so tempted he is
nothing pollute. That other relygyous came after which was not so virtuous as
the first / and found the same vessel / and in beholding it he was tempted to
take it like as ye other was / but he resysted not so constantly ye temptaco^n
but abode more le^ger in yt evil purpose by yt ye he had not ye courage so
soon ne so constantly to resyste it as that other. Nevertheless he constrained
hy^self in such wise yt he took it not / likewise may be said yt he was not
pollute / and as touching to the retrybuco^n and reward / it may be said yt in
so much yt he had had more pain to refrain his dysordynate affecco^n fro
thacco^plysshement of ye evil purpose / of so much he ought to have ye more
merit. An old fader said yt he which executes his will after his sensual
apetyte / is not in ye grace of god / netheles if he sy^ne ygnorau^tly / he may
return to our lord by penance / but he ye will follow his will / which is
not after god / and will not inquire of good and Just persons / how he ought
to conduyte hy^ in thobseruaco^n of his worthy and lowable co^mau^deme^n but
reputeth himself so wise / yt he will not ne dayneth not to use ye counsel
of other / uneath and with great pain comes he to the way of health. An old
fader was axed of a relygyous man what sygnefyeth ye words which ben read in
ye gospel saying / that ye way ye ledeth to life is short and strayt / ye
which old fader answered saying thus / the way strayt and short is such /
yt is to wit / you a man be ferme and constau^t / in resystyng vyolently to his
cogytaco^ns and thought / in such wise yt for the love of god / and in obeyng
to his co^mau^deme^^ / he smite of and cast away from hy^ all his euylles and
dampened wylles. And to this purpose is fou^den in holy writ / in the acts of
ye blessed apostles / yt they said to our savior Ihesu christ. Sire we have
forsaken all things and have followed the. An other old fader / ye like as
thorder of the relygyon is more honorable than the order of seculers. In like
wise a relygyous stranger that is to say dwelling in a strange place and
ought fro his birth ought to be the myrrour of other in well doing in all
manners to strange relygyouses and nedy for he ought better to know their
indygences than he yt never was forth out of his celle. An other aged fader
said that if a work man dwell in a place where there be none other work men /
he may not their prouffyte. For ye virtue of a work man co^systeth in yt / ye
he enforce hy^ to work / and yt in werkyng he mynysshe not / that is to say /
if he make it not better / at lest yt he make it not worse in ye end than
at the beginning. In like wise a slothful man if he dwell with a good work
man / he prouffyteth / or if he prouffyteth not at least he does naught. An
other said that a man which habou^deth in words / / and puts them in
effect by good works / is lykeneth to a tree yt wexeth grene by thabondau^ce
of fair leaves / and bears no fruit. In like wise also as a tree charged with
fruit wexeth grene when that it is garnysshed with fair leaves / right so a man
yt is fructuous by virtuous works / renders himself grene and delectable by
his good words / which excyteth and admonesteth other to do well by his
example. An other aged fader said that on a time a relygyous person which had
co^mysed a sin much great / was after strongly dyspleasau^t in his courage to
do it / wherefore moeued of co^puncco^n / and desyry^g to do penance went to
an old fader / and with out to confess hy^ ye he had done ye said sin axed
hy^ such an askyng / if a relygyous had co^mysed such a sin / might he
recover ye way of health. The old fader which was not much dyscrete heryng
hy^ / a^swered and said to hy^ / ha brother you have lost thy soul / yt which
answer herd by ye relygyous / he said as dyspayred / sith yt he was lost / he
had no more to do for tabyde in religyo^ / and therefore he returned in to ye
world. Netheles in gooyng he concluded to go and manyfeste his sin to an
other holy fader named Syluayn / yt which was a man virtuous and replenysshed
with great dyscreco^n. Coming then to hy^ ye said relygyous / he durst not
say to hy^ his syne but in this manner / yt he had asked ye other old fader.
Likewise he asked ye same old abbot Syluayn / the which in asweryng to hy /
began to tell of holy scripture in saying / ye a man was not all dampened of
his sy^ne for reason of his thought oonly. The relygyous heryng his answer /
and taking in hy^ courage and hope / co^fessyd his sin to ye said abbot
Syluayn / yt which his co^fessyon herd as a good leche / ga^e to his soul a
right good remedy which he took out of holy scryptures saying / yt always he
had remedy by ye mean of penance yt which was establysshed for they^ yt by
very contryedern and charity converted them to our lord. And ye same abbot
enjoined to hy^ helthful penance which he acco^plysshed and did with right
great courage and was afterward of right good and holy life. And it happed after
some years passed yt ye said abbot Syluayn / as by adventure passed by the
place where as dwelled ye old fader / which by his rygorous a^swere had put
ye said relygyous in desperaco^n / and told to hy^ yt which was happed in
saying to hy^ / yt ye same relygyous by the moyen of his contryco^n and
penance had in such wise prouffyted in virtuous works / that he was among
his brethern as a sterre shynyng and Il^umynyng they^ / yt which thing ought
to be noted / specially by they^ ye have power to correct ye sins of other /
to the end yt they ought to beware to bring they^ in despayr by fault of
dyscreco^n / and amyably to enduce they^ to helthfull penance. An other said
yt we be not dampened of our thought^s and cogytaco^ns for so much as they
bring us under / and enter within us but if we use euylles and resyste them
not / they be then cause of our da^pnaco^n / and oftymes it happeth yt by
they^ when we do and obey they^ / we lose our good virtues / and by they^ also
when we resyste them / we recouere them and obtain a glorious crown. A
another aged fader said yt a relygyous ought not to have any famylyaryte with
seculer people / ne knowleche with wy^me^ne to trust in a child. An other
brother axed an old fader in saying to hy^ that many te^ptaco^ns came upon him /
and he wist not how to witstande he^ / and prayed hy^ yt he would teache hy^ how
he might ouerco^^^ ^cym. To whom he answered yt he (...) not to resyste against
all / but against one pryncypally / saying to him fourthermore / that among
great no^bre of te^ptaco^ns / there is one that is always ye chyef / yt is to
said ye most evil / that is to say the werst of all the other / and yt he to
whom such evil te^ptaco^^s present them in so great no^bre ought dylygently
to think and co^sydere in himself / yt he ought tenforce to overcome them
and cast they^ away from him / and in ye dooyng / all the other shall goo
away and depart lightly.

An other holy fader excytyng his brethern to resyste their te^ptaco^ns said to
they^ these words. I pray you my brethern / yt like as ye have refrayned and
restrained your evil operaco^ns. In like wise ye refrain and restrain your
evil wylles and thoughts.

Also said an other holy fader / that he that will dwell in deserts / or in
thermytage / ought to be dyscrete for to teache in such manner yt he have no
need to he taught / and yt he suffer not by defaute of wit any do^mage.

An other old fader was asked of a relygyous person / how and by what work
he might get ye grace of god / or by fastings / or by wakynges / or having an
heart pyteous. To whom ye old fader answered / that he might find and get
the grace of god / in dooyng those things that he said / forseen yt he did
they^ in good dyscreco^n. He said to hy^ furthermore / yt many had given to
their bodies great afflycco^ns / of which they had brought forth no fruit /
because yt they had done they^ without dyscreco^n. And yet he said / if
affectuously we fast / we learn all the holy scripture / and let us set all
our thought and affection to be true as Dauyd. And if in dooyng all the
things / we have not yt which god wylled yt we had / that is to wit charity
and humylyte / our fastings and other operaco^ns be stynkyng and abhomynable
tofore god. There was an other brother being resydent in his celle whom the
deuylles would begyle / and which appyered to him in lykenes of angellys /
warnyng hy^ yt he should be a serchour or enquyrer for his other brethern.
After which apparyco^n / he transported himself toward an old fader / and
said to him. Fair fader I am come hither to the for to have thy counsel. For
ye angellys have appyered to me in great light / excytyng me to go for my
brethern in enqueste to seche they^. The holy fader answered to hy^. My sone
take none head / for they be deuyllys which will deceive ye / but if they come
any more unto the / say to they^ / dampened enemies I have nothing to do with
you for to here you / ne have ye no more to do with me. I shall well arise when
I will for to do my things will ye or not. The same brother then concludyng
to observe thynstrucco^n and commandment of ye old fader / returned in to
his celle / and ye night following / ye deuyllys like as they had be accustomed
came^ to solycyte and excyte hy^ to do yt as it is before said / but he answered
they^ like as he was taught by ye holy fader. Then they said to hy^ these
words / this evil man begyleth yt as you shall apperceyue. In few days after
ye said brother transported hy^ toward the said fader (...) to borowe some
money of hy^. And when he axed hy^ / that other how (...) he had it / answered
to hy^ yt he had ^^ne / ne none would lene hy^ / and he retor^ed to his celle /
where the said tendes tempted him as they did tofore / and sayden to him yt he
which had let him to do yt ye they had admonested him to do / had deceived
hy^ / and that he was but a liar / and he which had refused to lene hy^ money
/ saying that he had none / how be it yt he had enough to lene hy^ / wherefore
he might know yt he was a liar. The brother then rysyng erly on ye morn came
to the said old fader and told to him all yt he had herd / the which
answered to hy^ that it was truth yt he had ye money but he would not lene
it hy^ / because yt he knew well / if he had lent it him yt he shole have
evil used it to ye hurt of his soul / and for ye cause he had leuerlye / and
in lyeng to break one of the co^mau^deme^^^ of god / than to be cause to make
hy^ to break ten / in lenyng him ye money / by which they both might happily
have run in myscyef and great trybulaco^n. And after said to hy^ yt he should
no more give heryng to ye deuylles which would begyle him. The relygyous brother
conforted by ye words of ye old fader returned in to his celle / was better
content than he was before^

Three relygyous brethern camen to an old fader in Sychye / ye one of them
said to him / that he had so much studied ye old testament and ye new / that
he had al retained it in his my^de. And the holy fader said to him yt he had
well acquyted himself / and ye he had replenysshed all the heaven with words.
That other said that with ^^honde he had written all a long (...) new
testament. And he answe^^ hy^ yt he had filled all the wynde^^ with papyer. And
the third said to him / yt he had be solytary in his celle / yt ye grass was
grown in ye enter. To whom he answered that he had putt away from hy^ the
virtue of hospytalyte. Some faders recyten of an old virtuous man yt which
oftymes when any man came to hy^ for to ask any good Instrucco^n for to be well
edefyed in his conscience He said to hy^ of good affecco^n. Now sith yt you
come to me for to have counsel of me. I shall say to ye for to give to the
good counsel what thing we have to do / you must ymagyne yt I am here as god
syttyng in his Judgment / for to decyde and Judge ye doubtous causes that you
askedest. Now ask you what you wylt / and I shall answer to the / if thou
say have mercy on me I shall answer to the in the person of god / if thou
wylt I have pity on the / have you pity and mercy on thy brethern / and in so
dooyng I shall have mercy of the / and if you wylt yt I forgive the / forgive you
thy neighbor / wylt you then say ye god be cause to dampne the / or to save
the. Certes nay. But it is in us to be saved if we will be saved. Some other
said of an old fader being in his celle / the which was much penyble in
labor / that on a time in labouryng in his celle / an holy man came to him. And
as he entered he herd yt he spack and chydde as there had been moo men with him
saying. Ha how for one oonly word have I lost all these things. That other
being withoutforthe wend yt he had chydd^^th an other / and knocked at his
dote for to go in and to appease them / and he entryng in and seeing that there
was none but he allone / asked hy^ where he was to whom he had chydde. To whom
he answered yt he chydde to himself / because yt he had late retained in his
mind.xiiij. volumes of books And as he issued out of his celle a little / he
had herd a worldly word / which had made him to forgete all that which he
had estudyed / and complained him of that which in coming for to do the
seruyse dyuyne / that word oonly that he had herd / came to him in his mind /
and for that cause he did chyde against his thoughts as said is.

An other said to an old au^cyent fader / that sometime when he was heavy of
sleep / he might not arise at hour couenable for to do his seruyse / and when
he saw the hour passed / he was ashamed and dyspleased that he could not done
say his service / and asked how he ought to do The old fader answered to him.
If this Inconuenyent hap to him any more to sleep unto the morning / that
nevertheless when he a woke / he should arise / and shette his door and wyndowes
/ that is to say / he should cast from him all occupaco^ns temporal / and
do his service. For it is written that the day and the night be ours / and in
all time we ought to gloryfye our lord god.

An other old fader said that therben some men that eten much / and yet they
have great hunger. And also there ben some that eten right little / and have
none hunger / but ben full. And always they have ^oost merit and thank / ben
they that ete and have hungre / and more than they that eten little and ben
full.

An other old ancient fader said / if it so happed that between the and an
other were moeued any Ryotous words / and thy adverse party denied to have
said the said word / beware and keep the well to enforce the ayenste him
saying that he had said it. For in so dooyng / thou sholdest moeue him more
strongly in ire, and shall mow say to the that he had said it / where it
were better that the questyon were suspended in saying that he had never spoken
it.

A Relygyous man asked and demanded of an old ancient fader / saying. I have
a sister which is right poor / if I would do to her any alms / is it not
all one / as though I did it to any other poor person. The old ancient
fader answered to him / nay / by cause that the blood excyted him to do more to
her / than to any other person / and in so dooyng he might err / in estemyng
the alms to be better employed on his sister / than to the other person /
the which should be yet more poorer than his said sister.

An other old ancient fader said / that a relygyous ought never to herkene
any people that chyden / ne sclaundred each other.

An other said / beware that thou herkene not / ne to receive agreably all tho
things that been said to the / ne give to every word thy consentyng.

An other s^^d that a man should be sloth and (...) bylue / and prompte and
ready to (...) ^e truth.

An old (...) ^yent fader said / that if a relygyous person being resydente
in his celle / purpose for to do any good work / and in that purpose he have
any varyaco^n in his courage in ^uche wise that the love that he ought to have
to god be so cooled that he put not in effect ye same purpose / then
assyste and present them to hy^ ye deuylles which trouble hy^ in such wise
/ yt they make hy^ to understand ye contrary / that which seems to them
good.

An other relygyous said yt at the beginning ye relygyon was Instytued / yt
always and as often that you relygyouses of any manner relygyon assembled them
for to speak of any helthfull thing for their souls / they departed they^ each
of them a part / and so departed prayed to god / yt he would to they the
grace to determyne well to his honor and praysy^g ye thing for which they
were assembled / but now in these present days / when we gadre and assemble
together. we occupye us in noyses and debates / and draw each other in to the
depnesse of hell.

An other said that if our soul be conduyted and ruled by sobrenes / lightly
it shall mow keep our body fro sin And if in such wise we may not conduyte
us at less way we ought to enforce us with all our power and strenght to
keep us from evil vsyng our tongue to the end that we have not so great
occasyon to sin. An other said yt for to pray god and to knowleche his be
nefaytes yt he does to us / and is necessary for to that end be we in this
world / and it suffyseth not to teache other to do well by words oonly / but it
behooves us to excyte they^ examples of good manners. For it is a strange thing
to say with ye mouth / yt a man will not put in effect by works. An other
said yt it be houeth of necessyte to ye relygyous yt will solytaryly live in
his celle to have always some manner work to occupye hy^ self / if he purpose
to serve god / for the devil comes often for to put hy^ fro his good purpose.
Nethelesse when he fyndeth hy^ besyly and virtuously laboury^g be it in dyuyne
seruyse or other good work / he is constrained to depart by cause he fyndeth
none occasyon / that he may tarry with hy^ / but if of adventure by force of
te^ptaco^ns / and for defaulte to persyste in good works he fall in sin in
such wise yt he have upon hy^ power and domynaco^n / yet he ought not therefore
to have dyspayr. For oftymes comes to hy^ ye holy ghost / to the end to reduce
hy^ to good way / by which he ought to enforce hy^ to opene ye way by good
works to the end yt the devil by his malice make hy^ to return back. On a
time ye relygyouses of Egypt came to ye hermytages of Sychye / for to see the
old faders ye dwelled there. They being arrived and come^ after yt they had
frequented among them / they knew that they were much feeble of over long
fasting. And they after their fasting / took their refecco^ns / and for their
great abstynences they were Inmoderate in etyng / whereof ye relygyouses of
egypt were admeruaylled. Their sovereign abbot that knowing and wyllyng to
take away ye sclau^dre / concluded in hy^ self to preche / and in deed preched
of this matter in the church of Sychye in saying to his relygyouses / that they
should fast and augmente their abstynences They of Egypt that were comen
thither would have departed / but the said abbot retained them and desired
them to fast in like wise. And they were content to do so by two long
hole days endurynge / whereof they were sore grieved and febled. But they of
Sychye which had bego^ne their fasting sooner than ye other / fasted an hole
weke / and wha^ ye satyrdaye was come^ ye relygyouses of egypt token their
refecco^ns with they^ of Sychye / in so doing for as much as ye said
relygyouses of Egypt enforced they^ to ete hastily and gredyly / one of ye old
faders of Sychye took ye hand of one of they^ saying yt he should ete sobrely
as relygyous me^ ought to ete / ye other put his hands fro hy^ and said yt he
should let hy^ be in peace for he deyed almost for hu^gre / and then replied
ye old fader to hy^ in saying. If ye of egypt in fasting but.ij days only /
have suffered this fast inpacyently / wherefore and by what reason have ye
wo^dred on ye brethern of Sychye though they take with good appetyte their
refecco^ns / after yt they have fasted an hole weke without etyng of any thing
/ like as they have been acustomed to do or dynaryly. The other heryng these
words / and co^syderyng by their great abstynences / ye great abstynences of
ye other / were sorry and dyspleased of that they had said and dyden therefore
penance / and so well edefyed of the Sychyens they returned with great Joy
unto their celles and habytaco^ns in Egypt. A seculer person renou^cyng ye
world took thabyte of a monk / and went to thermytages and enclosed himself
in a celle saying yt he would be solytary. Certain old faders his neighbors
aduertysed yt he had auau^ted hy^ to lead a solytary life / came^ to hy^ and put
hy^ out / and after constrained hy^ to go about ye celles of ye brethern and do
penance of the folysshe words yt he had spoken in requyryng each of they^
that they would pardo^ne hy^ / and that he was not solytary but late had take
the beginning of ye life of a relygyous person. Some old faders sayden / if
you see a young adolescente of his presu^ptuous will would stye up in to heaven /
yt is to say enhau^ce himself in presumpco^n and vain glory / you ought
to take and reteyne hy^ by ye foot / that is to say / to correct him sharply
in refraynyng his folysshe affocco^ns / and to make him to tumble to therthe /
that is to say in humylyte / for he ought not ne apperteyneth him so to do.

A brother said unto an old fader / that he desired a good brother after his
will for to dwell with hy^. To whom the old fader answered / to him you say
well my lord. That other affermed that it was all his desire / not knowing
that the old fader was ylle content with his folly. Then ye old fader
seeing that the said relygyous esteemed / that ye said old fader took his
words in good party / said to hy^ these words or likewise. Then if you
fondest a relygyous person according after thy will / would you dwell with
hy^. Certainly that would I answered ye young relygyous. Then answered ye old
fader to hy^ / yt it is not then to the end / yt you sholdest follow his will /
but yt he should follow thine / and yt you sholdest rest thy self in him / the
brother by these words knew what ye old fader mente / and fylle down to ye
ground offryng himself to do penance therefore saying. Fair fader I pray yt
that ye forgive me my folly. Verily I me gloryfyed strongly of yt which I
supposed to have well said / where as I understood not well my self.

Two brethern germayn renounced ye world / of whom he yt was ye less of age
had first bego^ne to ensyewe thestate of relygyo^. A lytyl time after ye they
were relygyous / came to they^ an old fader for to vysyte they^ / to whom they
presented a bacy^e for to wasshe his feet / and he yt was youngest of age offered
hy^ to wasshe his feet. Then ye old fader held his hands and put hy^ away
/ and suffered hy^ yt was oldest for to do to hy^ yt seruyse / how be it yt ye
first coming to ye monastery had been acustomed to do it / the which thing
seeing ye brethern yt were there assystent said to hy^. Reverend fader this
brother which is younger of age has been relygyous tofore ye other. I retche not
said ye old fader. I will take away ye first entryng fro ye younger / and I
will give it to hy^ yt is most of age. An old fader said / ye prophets have
togydre wryte^ ye books seruy^g to our doctrine. Our faders ben come^ after
which have put to many things / and after ben come^ their successors which
have reco^mau^ded they^ to their remembrance / that is to say yt they have
well studied them / and fynably they ben come^ of the generaco^n that we ben of
/ which have written they^ in skynnes of parchemyn and that done they have
left them lyestylle in their wyndowes.

An old fader said yt ye stock yt ye relygyouses vsen to were / is ye sign
of Innocencye that other habyte of which they cover their sholdres and bynde^
their heedes / is ye sign of the cross / and ye gyrdell by which they gyrde
them is the sign of strength / and therefore said he that they ought to be
conuersau^t after ye sygnefyau^ce of their habyte / saying that in dooyng all
things by good desire / they shall never faylle.

Here after follows an other little treatise techyng how a man ought to live
sobrely. And begins in Latin. Frate^ quidam.


A Brother moeued of devotion prayed thabbot Arsenius yt he would say some
doctrine or techyng. To whom the holy fader answered / what someuer thing yt you
do / enforce ye always that thy will and thought be rewled after ye will of
god / in such wise that ye works of withoutforth / ^e first withinforth ruled
after the Judgment of right and reason / and the said holy abbot said / if we
ask for god / we shall find him / and if we keep him / he shall dwell with
us. For as ye gospel says Ask and ye shall have / knock and it shall be
opened to you.

Thabbot Agathon said that a relygyous man ought not to suffer ye his
conscience remorde ne grudge of any thing. The said abbot had be.iij. days
during his eyes open wha^ he should deye ye which seeing his brethern /
touched hy^ and askyng. Abbot where art you. To whom he said. I am in ye
presence of ye great Judge for to receive my salayre after my mery^ and
deservings / how fair fader / ye have lived always after ye law of god /
wherefore dread ye / then a^swerd thabbot. Alas my childere^ I know not if
ever day of my life I did any work pleasant to god / for I am of frayl
co^dyco^n / then after said ye brethern / have yt not very trust and
affyau^ce yt ye works yt be done in charity / brynge^ a man all strayt to
heaven. To whom he answered all yt we do is on certain unto ye time yt we come
tofore ye great Judge / and therefore I presume not of my works / for the
Judgment of god / and they of the men ben well dyfferent / and as they would
furthermore have axed hy^ of some things / he said to them / keep ye charity
among you / and speak no more to me / and anon after he rendered and yielded up
his soul to god / and in his death appeared a sign / by which he showed in his
spyryte / yt he rejoiced hy^ as he had saluwed his fre^dis And this proceeded of
that which he had well kept the commandments of god / without the which
none may come to the port of health. It is recou^ted of thabbot Ammoys / yt
when he went to the church / he would never his dyscyple come nygh hy^ / and
if by adventure he approached hy^ for to axe hy^ any thing. Anon he said to hy^
ye he should with draw hy^ far fro hy^ / saying ye in spekyng of things
prouffytable / me^ may sometime speak of vain things and peryllous for ye
soul / and therefore it is better to be still and speak not / than to speak
evil. We have also of saint Johan baptyst / yt in thage of his youth he fled
in to deserte / to the end ye he should not defoylle hy^ self with evil
spekyng. Thabbot Ammoys asked of thabbot Asee. Fair fader how see you me
Thabbot Asee answered as an angel And after that yet again the said abbot
Ammoys asked again. How see you me now / thabbot Asee a^swered / me seems now
said he ye I see sathanas / for inco^tynente yt you warnedest me for to make my
salewyng / it seemed yt you smotest me with a glayue through ye heart. By this is
showed that the proud and evil persons may not endure / till that some man
correct them of their vices. Thabbot Alones said ye if a man say not in his
heart. I my self and god oonly ben in this world / a man shall not have rest
in his conscience / and yt he understood thus. In the world arn but two manners
of living / ye one is to live after the law of god / and that other after the
world. The same abbot Moses said yt a man if he will / may in a day deserve
by good operaco^ns so much / that he shall win heaven at the end.

Thabbot Bysaryon in his deyeng gaaf to his brethern one such a techy^ge or
enseygnement. My brethern said he / a relygyous person ought to be the very
light of other / by good life and by good example. For it is written in the
gospel / ye ben the light of the world. Thabbot Danyell and thabbot Ammoys on
a time walked together / then said thabbot Ammoys. Fair fader wha^ shall we go
in to thy celle / thabbot Danyell said / who is he yt may take away god fro us
/ there is no person yt may take hy^ fro us / for when we were in our celles /
he was with us / and now yt we be out of our celles / in like wise he is with us.
Thabbot Euagrius said it is a great thing to pray god without to have any
lettyng / but it is a gretter thing to sing and psalmodye without to have any
enpesshement or lettyng. This same abbot also said / remember ye always of thy
last end / and of ye great Judgment of god / and ye shall never offend god.
Thabbot Theodore said if god punysshe us for the neclyge^ces that we do in
syngyng and psalmodyeng / we shall never be saved. Thabbot Theonas said yt our
thought is so much enpesshed and let by worldly things yt we ben full of
co^cupyscences / but we ought to withdraw us by the grace of god. Some
brethern came^ often for to te^pte an holy abbot named Johan ye short because he
led a strayt life / and for to give to hy^ occasion to speak they said to hy^.
Blessed be god / it has rayned suffysasstly this year / in so much yt ye
palms ben well aroused and watered / and begy^ne to burgene and bring forth
leaves grene and pleasant. Then a^swered ye holy abbot / my childern right so
is it of ye holy ghost wha^ he descends in to ye hertes of men he arouseth
and watreth they^ and makes the^ to bring forth leaves in ye dread of god / and
makes they^ to renew by ye plenytude of grace. Some brethern said yt ye same
abbot had made a raylle in his gardyn / but because of his co^te^placo^n / he
knew not that it grew till yt it was of a great heyght against ye wall / and
had then leuys well great. There was sometime in Sychye an old man of good
life / but he was much forgetefull / ye which for to axe cou^s^yl of his
affairs / went to Johan ye short and wha^ he was there / ye holy abbot gaaf to
hy^ cou^seyl upon yt which he axed / and so returned / but anon as he was in
his celle he had forgote^ ye which had be said to hy^ / and returned again and
axed counsel as tofore / but as soon as he was departed fro ye place he
forgate it / and for shame he durst not return for dread lest he should let
ye said abbot. Yet netheles he returned and said to ye said abbot. Fader ye
know well yt I am much forgetefull / wherefore I am aferde to come often to ye
for lettyng of the. To whom ye said abbot said / light this c^^dell / so he
did / and after he said / now light yet all these ca^dellys with ye first
ca^dell / and in like wise he did. After he axed hy^ the light of this ca^dell
is it any thing lassed to have lyghted ye other / the old man a^swered nay
fair fader / and then said thabbot to hy^. In like wise am I not lassed ne
angry wha^ you come to me for to cou^seyl the / and therefore without to make
any dyffyculte come always hither wha^ ye shall have need / and thus by ye
patience of they^ both / ye forgetefulnes went his way / and by this it
appyereth yt they of ye contree conforted each other gladly. A brother febled by
sckenes said to the said abbot Johan the short yt he was strongly seek / and
therefore he axed when his brethern called hy^ to labor / if he ought to go or
nay / in saying o^ ye one side I have auowed obedience / yt excyted me to go
thither / and on that other side the greuau^ce of my maladye agaynsaieth me. The
holy man answered me. Caleph ye sone of Ienophone said to Ihu^s the sone of
Nane. I was.xl. year old when I was brought in to this co^tree. and now I am
well.lxxx. year old / and not withstondy^g yet am I strong for to enter in to
bataylle and to fight / and for so much do you semblably / and enter in to
labor if you may with thy brethern / or else enter in to thy celle / and
bewepe and waylle thy sins by thy self / and then if they find the weeping
/ they shall not make the to come out.

Thabbot Cassianus said yt an old man prayed on a time to god / yt when he
herd vain words that he might sleep / and when he herd ye word of god that
he might never sleep. And to this purpose he recyted this / that one time as he
preched to his brethern / they slept all / in such wise yt they understood not
his words / but for to show they^ that ye devil was cause thereof / he began
to speak of vayn words and idle / and inco^tynent all his brethern awoke and
very dylygent to here hy^ and to lawhe. Then ye holy fader wayllyng said /
when I spoke to you late of holy scripture ye slept and understood nothy^g /
but when I speak of vayn things / each leyeth to his ere / and ye be more besy
to here idle words tha^ ye words of god / wherefore my brethern I admoneste and
warn you that wha^ ye ought to here ye word of god / keep you from slepy^g /
for know ye yt it is ye devil that lets you to here the helthefull
predycacyons.

Thabbot Pastor being in his young age went unto an holy man for to ask hy^
three things. But when he was comen thither he forgate one of them He returned
in to his celle / took his keye for to opene his door / and in taking it he
remembered ye thing that he had forgote^ and inco^tynent without openyng of his
door he returned thither from whens he came. And when ye holy man saw hy^ / he
said to hy^ / you have hasted ye sore to come again. The young man answered / as I
opened my door I remembered me of that I had forgoten / wherefore without openyng
of my door I am comen to ye hastily. Then said to hy^ ye holy man you shall be
one time a very pastor / and shall be reno^med through all Egypt. Thabbot Ammon
came to thabbot Pastor saying / if my neighbor come in to my celle / or if I go
in to his / ought I to return with hy^. The holy man said / yt should be well
done / for yongth has need of great ward and keeping / ye abbot Ammo^ said
afterward / and what should ye old men do. Pastor answered ye old men now
constau^t / wherefore they have not so great need of ward and taky^ge head to /
and then said ye abbot Ammo^ if I will speak to my neighbor / ought I to
speak of scripture / or else of you words of old faders / thabbot a^swered /
if you may not be still / it better to speak of ye words of ye old faders
tha^ of scripture For oftymes it is dangerous to speak of scripture to them
that understand them evil. On a time one axed of the abbot Pastor how a man
should keep hy^ from many fylthes bodily and goostly / and he answered / if a
man will live clenely as touching ye body and the soul / he ought to live
sobrely as well in metes as in words / for a man glotonous may not live Justly
ne long / and after ye common saying / gloto^ny maked and caused m^ me^ to dey
tha^ ye swerd or glayn It is said ye thabbot Pastor made ne did ever any good
work / but if he remembered it co^tynuelly an hour tofore And then after he
achyeued his work / wyllyng by this to show / yt in all works / he ought
first think on it / to fore he do it.

A man axed on a time of thabbot Paysyon / how he might dread god / to whom he
answered. Goo and Join the with a man dredyng god / and anon you shall dread
as he does. And herto accords the psalmyste. Thou shalt be holy with holy
men / and evil with evil men. The same holy man said yt the dread of god is
the beginning and ye end of all goodness / wytnes of the psalmyste ye says /
that ye beginning of sapyence is the dread of god. We have also example of
Abraham to whom our lord said after that he had made an altar for to
sacrefyse to him his sone Ysaac. I see well now yt you dredest god. Yet also the
said abbot said / ye none ought to dwell with men full of noise and debatefull
/ ne with them that love strife. He said also yt an abbot named Loath said on a
time to thabbot Peter / when I am in my celle. I am in peace of conscience / but
when any comes you to me recou^teth worldly things. I am troubled. And this
holy abbot said when one axed hy^ of worldly things. Brother thy key has
opened my door. And when he was axed what that was to say. He answered / if
any come to the yt is in thy celle and ye axedest him of worldly things / ye
openest the gate of his thought / and hereth often things yt prouffytes to him
nothing. A Relygyous man ought when he sees any brother speak to him to exhort
hy^ to weep and bewaylle his sins. And in so dooyng he shall give him good
doctrine. For there / where as is never we pyng ne dyspleasaunce of evil deeds
/ there may be no pure conscience An other brother said to the said abbot / when
I am alone in my celle. I by weep my sins. But when there is any with me / or
ell^s yt I go out. I find none occasyon to weep. Then answered to him
thabbot. Thus then is not lamentaco^n always subget to yt but you have it
oonly for a time. After this ye brother asked him what was it to say / the holy
fader answered / that a man ye desired to get any virtue / he ought to seek it
in time and in all hours / yet uneath shall he mow find it. And if he search
and seek well he shall find it to his prouffyt.

A brother said to thabbot Sysoys. Fair fader I have great desire to keep mine
heart clean from sin / to whom the holy fader answered. How may we keep our
heart clean / if our tongue has the gate open / as who says / yt a man
ouermoche spekyng may not be without blame / and you that cessest not to speak
evil / how wenest you to keep thy conscience clean fro sin.

Thabbot Syluayn dwelling in the montayn of Syna had a dyscyple / the which
wyllyng to goo in thexpedyco^n of some of his affairs / prayed ye said abbot
yt he would arrouse or water his gardyn. The holy abbot rauysshed in
contemplaco^n took water and his vysage watered the said gardyn. And in so
doing came an other yt asked him whyhe had covered his face. The which answered
that he had done it to the end that he should not see ye flowers of the trees ye
were there / that in seeing them he were not enpesshed ne let to leave his
contemplaco^n.

Thabbot Serapyon said / all in like wise that as the knights which ben
tofore their prince and captain in battle / ought not to look here and there
for to flee / but owen to fight vayllyantly. In like wise the relygyouses and
other yt have given them self to god ought not to behold the worldly things
/ ne also to behold the bodily pain / for if they so do / they shall be
herteles and ferdfull.

Saint Syncletyce said / we desire all to be saved / but by our neclygence we
lose often our health / and we will do no pain to have and get it. Furthermore
said saint Syncletyce / let us live sobrely. For by the five wits of our
body / the thieves enter for to rob the virtues of our soul. And we see if
the wyndowes of an house be opened yt the smoke enters lightly in to hit. In
like wise if our five wits be opened unto the things of the world / anon
our soul is obfusked by the smoke of sin. Yet said the same saint Syncletyce
that we must be armed on all parties against ye enemies / for they enter both
within and without. And as we see sometime ye ship withoutforth troubled with
ye wawes and flood of the water / and oftymes it is filled withinforth without
the flood without right so is it of us. For sometime we sin by works
outward / and sometime by works inward oonly. It should not be enough to a
man of arms to be armed on ye head all oonly / for he might soon be hurt of
his enemy through his body. Thus it suffyseth not enough to resyste ye
outward temptaco^ns but also the inward temptaco^ns. In this party is showed
to us that there is no surete in this world / in what so^euer state it be. And
of this witnesses thappostle saying / see well to and keep himself that
stondeth vpryght by virtue / that he fall not ne overthrow by sin / we ben
in this world as ye maryners that know not where they be / witness of the
psalmyst ye says that our life is like to the sea / in the which ben some
parties full of stones / the other full of diverse manner of bestes. some ben
much tempestuous. Other ben peasyble / but among them that live some saylle
by the stones in the stonye parties / as they that been obstynate. Other by the
parties full of diverse bestes and monstres / as they that be proud. Other by
the parties stylle and peasyble / as ben the Relygyouses which ben out of the
tempest of the world. Other saylle by the places tempestyous and full of
tempest. And nevertheless oftymes it happeth yt the seculers which seylle in
the derkenesse of Ignorance / for fere to lose their ship comen to the port
of health. And the relygyouses which ben with god in peace and tranquyllyte / by
neclygence drown them self in the sea of all evil and sins. We have here
to note what and how we ought to think.

An abbot named Ypericius said thus All thy thought be always in god desyryng
the heavenly bliss / and shortly you shall have it. Furthermore ye same holy man
said that the life of a monk ought to be like to ye life of an angel without
any catch or spotte of dedely sin.

Thabbot Orsesius to us reherceth yt if a man keep not his heart from evil and
abhomynable thought / and put in forgetyng all the good yt has be said of hy^.
And said after if ye enemy of hell find any place in the / incontinent he
surmou^teth yt / for as ye lamp lyghteth and shyneth / when it has suffysau^t
of oil mynystred in to it / and if it faylle and have none / ye light
quenches and gooth out. In like wise our heart by ye fire of charity
prouffyteth / and without ye same fire / it may do no fructuous work And
furthermore if a mows come for to ete ye oil and she feel ye beat of ye fire /
she comes no ner / but if ye fire be que^chyd in manner yt it have none hete /
she shall cast ye lamp down and break it. In like wise is it of our heart /
for when ye fire of charity departs from us / the holy ghost gooth his way /
and then comes ye enemy which assaylleth us / and in peruertyng all our
good purpose destroys the virtue of our soul by actual sin. But if we
live after god to our power / and it hap that we fall in any sin. God
reduces us to remembrance the pains of hell / and by ye holy ghost brings
us again to ye right way of penance / yt which may not be health full without
ye spyrytuell help of god. Two old faders spoke on a time togydre / of whom
yt one said to that other. I am now deed in ye world. As who would say that
he had so mortefyed his body by sharp and hard abstynences / yt he had none
occasyon to co^myse any great sins. And that other said / have no great
trust in thy self / for all is incertayne during this life / therefore ought
to be constau^t and vygorous against ye temptaco^ns of the fend of hell / ye
sees always and wayteth for to deceive us. The manner after which a relygyous
man ought to live is such A devout man ought always at even to think how he
has lived ye day / and what goods he has done / and how he has loved and
thanked god / and what sins he had co^mysed in weeping and way lyng in askyng
god pardo^ne and mercy. And if he do thus he may say ye he is a very
Relygyous. And in this manner lived an abbot named Arsenye.

For to do us to understand yt there is nothing more precious than ye time
said an old man yt he yt has lost gold or silver or other worldly richesse /
may oftymes recouere it / but he ye leseth the time may never recover it / for
ye time passed comes never again.

An holy man said ye in like wise as the knight gooyng to battle thy^ken
syngulerly on they^ / and ye hu^ter thinks not but on his pray. All in like
wise ought it to be of a relygyous man / for he ought first and syngulerly
think on his faith and conscience without to be over besy to know what other
do.

An holy man said ye like as we see the knights yt ben in an armee nygh by ye
prince / ben better kept / and yt they may not be assaylled but with great
dyffyculte. In like wise is it of us / for if we be nygh unto our capytayn ye
king of heaven / the fend our enmye shall not dar assaylle us / for it is
wryte^. Approuche ye unto me by devout oryson / and I shall approuche unto you
by thynfuly on of my grace. But some there ben ye approuche not / but vylaynesly
withdraw them. And there ben often taken of ye adversaries which throwe^ they^
down and in the end make them to deye. A brother said sometime to an holy man
yt he had no battle in his heart. The holy man that heryng answered to him /
yt be lykened to a castle ye which has four yates all open / and all they
that will enter / enter in to it / and assaylle it as them seem good. For all
thy five wits ben works to the to ye temptacyons of the devil. And if you
had a yate in thy castle well shette / you sholdest know anon ye
bataylles that been without which asked not but to take by assault thy poor
soul / if we say yt we have no sin / we deceive our self and troth is not
in us. It is found by writing of a relygyous / yt which when he had offended
/ abode not to repent him till on the morn / but did ye same day penance
saying. This same day I shall repent me / and to morn the will of god be done.

An holy man said / if we be not sobre without forth in conuersaco^n and
words. It is not possible that we be Just and ryghtfull withinforth.

The holy faders which had ye eye of understanding enlumyned with dyuyne grace
/ knowing clearly ye fallaces of ye fend our enemy / and therefore they said
that Satan had three puyssau^ces pryncypall among other upon men. The first is
yt he makes to forgete ye sy^nes the second is neclygence and sloth / the
third is couetyse. And these things proceed ye one of ye other / for if a man
forgeteth his sins he is neclygent / thus neclygence proceeds of forgetyng
and of neclygence comes concupyscence / the which rejected / a man shall
never fall in sin / but he shall be preserved by the help of god. The most
necessary thing among ye other / is to keep scylence and be still in following
ye doctrine of an old fader ye said. Take heed as much as you may to
scylence / and think on no vain things / but take heed to thy thoughts with
the dread of god if you thus do / you shall eschew and escape ye grynnes of the
fend our enemy. An holy man said to an other relygyous. The devil is thyn
enemy / you art in manner of an house / upon which he cesseth not to cast by
temptaco^n all the ordures and fylthes of sin yt he can find for to fylle
thy house and ye dyches of the same / to the end yt he may enter lightly / but you
ought little and little to reiecte and cast out those ordures and fylthes so
much yt the house of thy conscience be clean. For if you reckest not for to
purge it / he shall put therein so much yt you shall not cu^ne enter. But and if
you purge by very confession / thy house shall be clean / and god shall lodge
therein / and thus the devil shall not have there any access ne place.

An other old fader said that the horse that tourneth at mylle labored
strongly when his eyes be hid and is blyndfelde / but when he sees he will
not turn. In like wise they that been blind by sin / turn all about and
to all that temptacyon bring them / but they that been enlumyned of the holy
ghost eschew and put away lightly the temptaco^ns of the fend our enemy. An
other brother werkyng on a day in his celle / and make little and small mattes
/ was in thought for to go vysyte an holy man. And anon after came in his mind
the contrary / and said I shall go see hy^ within a certain time. After he
thought saying / if he deye dury^g this time I shall never see hy^ / therefore it
is better yt I go now / but for as much as my Ionckes ben now cut / it is
better that I achyeue and make an end of my mattes / and thus he was in
contrary thoughts one against an other. Nevertheless he took his robe which
was named melote / and departed lightly. And in walkyng he passed by the celle
of an other brother much wise / yt which seeing this brother go so hastily and
fast began to cry saying. O man taken with ente^dement whyther ghost you so
hastily / return and come to me / the which he did / and then the holy
fader said to him Return in to thy celle. Then the brother said to ye holy
fader / alas fair fader I have so terryble thoughts / that I have be
constrained to go out of my celle And this said he returned in to his celle /
and in entryng in he fill down to the ground doing penance / and asked of god
mercy. Then was herd a meruayllous cry of a legyon of deuylles / saying. O
monk you have ouercome^ we ben vaynquysshed by thyn obeyssau^ce / and his matte
whereupon he say flate down / was enbraced with a great fire / and the deuylles
all co^fused fled away as it had be a smoke / and by ye same the brother knew
the cautelles of the fendes his enemies. In the regyon of Sychye was an holy
man the which was strongly grieved with sickness / and when it came to
thartycle of ye death / all his brethern presented they^ about hy^ and clothed
hy^ with his habyte. After they began all to weep pyteously / but ye holy man
how well yt he was pressyd with sekenes opened his eyes and began to lawhe yt
notwithstondyng / ye brethern cessed not to weep unto ye time yt they saw hy^
lawhe yet eft ones / and yet a another time unto the no^bre of thryes / yt seen
they cessed to lamente and weep / and asked hy^. Fair fader you art so nygh the
death / which is so much doubtable / how may you lawhe and wherefore lawhest
you. I shall tell you said he. I have lawhed three times. The first because yt
ye dread ouermoche ye death / the second for I see yt there is none of you ready
now if ye death came for to fetch you / and thyrdly of the Joy yt I have /
consyderyng that I go fro the labor of this world unto the eternal rest of
heaven / and in thus saying he rendered his soul unto god.

A brother came to one of the old faders and said to hy^. Fader I am strongly
persecuted of diverse temptaco^ns / and I can find no remedy to eschew they^
The holy fader answered. My friend thou have despised ye dread of god / and
have thrown it to the ground / the which dread is strong against temptaco^ns
as the yren is strong against they^ that will consume it / and have taken instead of yren / which is the dread of god / a reed which is not of any
resyste^t. and by this reed which tourneth with every wind is understand
vnprouffytable and vain thoughts / for the which to resyste you shall take ye
fire of the dread of god. And if the reed of ye same vain thoughts come to
the / put the fire tofore them / and anon they shall be consumed and brought to
naught. As who should say. My brother and my friend / against all such
temptaco^ns behooves nothing but the dread of god before the eyes of thyn
entendement. An holy fader said / that a man may not love any thing / but if
first he hate the contrary of the same. And therefore he that will love virtue /
ought to hate vice and sin which is contrary to virtue. And thus then as
says the psalmyste. It behooves us to declyne from evil and take that is good
/ and to do it with all our heart / for god beholds more the will than the
work that proceeds. Adam our first fader sinned in paradyse / for he brake
the commandment of god. But Job being upon his dunghyll kept the
commandments / and to god plesed greatly his pacyence. And for somoche / god
ne demands but our affection and our heart. And he him self says in the
gospel. My child give to me thy heart and dread me / and keep my
commandments / and you shall live eternally with me.

Here begy^neth the treatise how one ought to pray without Intermyssyon and
without cessyng / and begins in latin. Dicebant de abbate.
IT is all open and manyfested that nature humayne / that is to say mankind /
which of him self was capax and ready to receive the everlasting bliss in
thastate of Innocencye / has been yolden and made unable and not capable of
himself to that bliss / by the sin of ye first man Adam / and has been
cause. And for to reconcyle hy^ to his maker. It was much necessary to have
some moyen the which may not be found but by holy and devout prayer. And for
this cause was oryson first fou^den / of which is treated in this present book
/ wherein is first determined of the contynuacyon of prayer by one such
example. Some holy faders sayden that thabbot Arsenius from the saterdaye at
even / that the son went down unto the sunday in the morning that the son
aroos / he had his hondes lift up toward heaven / and the head lift up / and
the heart enfla^med in the love of god contynuyng in oryson and prayer / whereby
is to us showed ye good affecco^n of ye old faders. The brethern came on a time
to the abbot Agathon / and asked him. Fader which is the grettest pain among
ye other. And he answered. My bredern I say to you yt I find no such pain
as to pray to god. For when a man dysposeth him most to pray / the devil
brings tofore him many Illusyons to let him. For he knows well that by
orayson and prayer his power is enpesshed and brought to naught / how well that
in other operaco^ns and works men have pain / nevertheless at end they have
rest. But in prayer it behooves to fight unto the last Instau^t of the same.

The abbot Dulas which was dyscyple unto thabbot Bysaryon said. I have some
time gone unto the celle of mine abbot / and have fou^den him lyeng down
prostrate in oryson abydyng there co^tynuelly by the space of xiiij. days And
after called me to him and said to me / follow me / and incontinent we went in
to thermytage. And when I was so retrauaylled of walkyng having great thirst /
then I said to hy^. Fader I have great thirst / and ye holy man went as fer
fro me as a man should cast a stone / and was there a little while in
contemplaco^n / and after came again to me bryngyng water in his garment made of
skynnes / of which water I drank And after from thens we went in to ye cite
of Lyco for to speak to thabbot Johan / whom we salewed at our coming saying to
him the cause and reason why we were come to him. Then began thabbot Bysaryon
to tell and show the reuelaco^ns that he had had saying. It has be showed
unto me / yt all the temples shall be destroyed / the which thing in like
wise after happed. For all the temples of thydoles were destroyed and brought
to naught.

Thabbot Euagrius said yt a man which has the courage faylled / ought to pray
to god. For it is written / pray with the dread of god / and labor contynuelly
in suffrages and prayers / and you shall not find thy self feeble of courage /
but strong against all temptaco^ns / we need to pray as well for ye sinners / as
for the Just and true / to the end also that we be preserved from the
enemies Inuysyble / which seche none other but to let us from our health /
wha^ a person is taken with an evil thought / he ought not ye hour to pray
for other / and forgete himself / but ought inco^tynent to fight for him self
by holy prayer against the same thought / and cast it from hy^. And after he may
pray for other.

An abbot which dwelled in Palestyne wrote to a bishop named Epyphanius this
ye follows. Reverend fader we have not despised ye rule to pray which you
haste delivered to us / but in keeping it besyly we sing pryme / tyerce / sexte
/ none / and euensong / the which abbot was repreued of ye bishop / and the
said bishop wrote to hy^ again in this manner. After yt answer yt I have had of
the abbot. I know well yt in ye other hours of the day / you and thy brethern
pray not / yt which thy^g suffyseth not For a very relygyous ought to pray
god incessau^tly / and if not with his mouth / act lest he ought to do it
with the heart. For oryson vocale is not always requesyte. Here is showed to us
yt we may pray god over all and in every place. For an abbot named Ysayas
seeing the brethern ye eten togydre made great noise / said to them / hold
your peace and make scylence / for I see one of you brethern etyng with you / yt
which perceth and thrylleth yt heue^s with his prayer as if he had said / ye
let him in making this noise for he is rauysshed in deuoco^n. And also how
well yt he eteth always he prayed god / and his oryson as fire enbraced with
charity gooth upon high.

Thabbot Loath came to thabbot Joseph and said to him. Fader after my power I
hold a little rule and a little hard. I fast but little / nor pray god but
little / and I think not much on his commandment / ne on my soul / without
to take but little rest / but always with all my power I eschew evil thoutes
/ and them I suffer not to abide in me in any wise / what ought I to do in
time coming. And ye holy man without saying any word arose up / and stratched
up his hands to heaven and devoutly prayed unto god / and incontinent for to
show his brennyng deuoco^n / his ten fyngres were enlumyned and brennyng like
unto la^pes bre^nyng / and then he began to say if you wylt be enbraced with
this fire of charity / you must do as I do. In this party is showed ye manner of
prayeng with out Intermyssyon / and how men ought to pray without ceassyng.

Certain brethern named bedemen came^ to thabbot Lucius which dwelled in
Hermato / and when they were comen the holy abbot asked. My brethern come
hither and tell me what work do ye and make with your hands. And they
answered / certainly fair fader we put not our self to any hondwerke / but
after yt saying of thappostle we pray unto god without intermyssion and
without ceassyng. Thabbot said to they^ / how my brethern when ye ete / ye
pray not / also when ye sleep ye pray not / and thus then it is not truth
yt ye say yt ye pray without ceassyng. Then yt brethern were all ashamed
and wist not what to answer. Then began he to say to they^. I shall show
you how in werkyng with my hands I pray always god. For when I am in my celle
set for to work I pray god without ceassyng / for I make a matte / or some
other thing / and in so doing I say / god have mercy on me after thy great
mercy / and put away my wyckednes / after the multitude of thy myseraco^ns and
thy great bounte. And after he said to the brethern / is not this prayer unto
god / and they answered yes. And furthermore he said to they^. I labor and
pray god all day and all yt night / and I win about xvi. pens with my
work / whereof I take.xij. pens to live by / and the remenau^t I give for
gods sake / and he to whom I give this money / prays for me when I ete /
or when I sleep. And by all thus is acco^plysshed in my yt which is said that
men owe to pray without Intermyssyon / wherefore it ought to be vnderstonden /
that it behooves to pray without ceassynge by him self or by other.

Some brethern asked of the abbot Macharye. Fader how ought we pray unto god.
The holy man answered / in making oraysons and prayers is not requesyte great
habondau^ce of words / but we ought to lift up our hands unto heaven and
say. Lord god / like as it shall please the / and like wise as you know
what need I have / so do thy mercy upon me. And if in prayeng any evil thought
come tofore the / say lord god help me / and without doubt seen that he
knows what thing is necessary to the / he shall help the and have mercy on
the. Therefore we ought to by leave / that long prayer is not always requesyte ne
praised. For in a common proverb it is said. Short prayer perceth heaven. We
have also in saint Mathewe / where as it is said / ye shall pray thus. Pater
noster etc. Fader our which art in heuens and so forth.

Of thabbot Sysoys / some relygyouses sayden / yt if he had soon brought down
his hands / when he had left them up to heaven making his prayers.
Incontinent he had be rauysshed and in a trance. And therefore when any was
with him in prayer / he made hy^ to take down his hondes / doubtyng that he
should enter in to a trance / or to be rauysshed / or that he should so abide
by long espace of time.

An old man said that contynuell prayer corrects the thought of sin. An
other said / that as it is not possible to a man to see his own face in foul
and trouble water / right in like wise it is not possible yt a man may know
his own fayte and deed / if it be not gadred in him self without to have
regard / without to think upon on the fayte and deeds of other.

An holy man came on a time to the mountain of Synay. And as he went he met
in his way a relygyous brother / the which all weeping said to hy^ Alas fader
we ben lost in our country For it rayneth not / and there is no moystnes in the
earth. Then said to him the holy man / ye ought to pray god for to have some
rayn. Then answered the brother. Alas we have prayed him so long / and
notwithstondyng it has not rayned. Then said the holy man to him / ye have
not prayed affectuously ne hertly enough. And if thou will wit and have
knowleche / come with me and let us pray together Then the holy man kneled
down on his knees / and lift up his hands in great deuoco^n and prayed god /
and anon it began to rain. That seeing the said brother / was sore aferde /
and fill down to the fete of the said abbot. The which abbot fleyng the
praysynge of the world and of men departed anon. Thus then many pray unto
god / but they be not herd / for they be not worthy.

Some freres sayden such words / We found on a time some old faders which
prayden god / with the which we set us down in salewyng them / and spack
with them long of many things. And then after we would have departed / and
we made to them request that they should pray to god. Then answerde of
tholdest of they^ saying. Have ye not prayde / we answered yes fair fader. But
when we entered in here our prayer was then done / and sythen we have always
spoken togydre / and by that we have not prayde / for one may not pray and
speak one with a another. The said holy man answered. My brethern pardo^ne me /
there is here one of our old brethern / yt which in speaking with you has
made an hundred and three prayers Thus then to speak togydre of puffytable
things and helthfull / lets not to pray / for that same is to pray god And
this said we prayde / and after the holy faders went their way and lest us.

Here begins an other little treatise conteynyng how a man ought to do
mercy. And begins in Latin. Preceperunt aliquando.
There is no man so much ygnoraunt in the world / but that he ought to come
and know / what is the mercy of god / we may not be saved after that we have
offended / but if god our lord be to us merciful In like wise also ought we
to be merciful one to a another. Therefore in this present treatise is made
menco^n of myserycorde and mercy. And it proceeds like as the other treatyes
precedent and by examples / of which the first is such. Some of the holy old
faders went on a time to thabbot Joseph in a place named pauese / and had
concluded to make to him a demand / that is to wit / if there come of their
friends or relygyouses for to vysyte they^ / if they ought to ete and drink
with them for to make them great chyre / and to receive them Ioyously. And
to fore yt they had asked of ye holy man / he knowing their thoughts said to
his dyscyples. Take heed what I shall do / and he took two stoles / that one on
the right side / and that other on the lift side / and made them both tweyne
to come in to hy^ and after said to them. Sytte down here by me. And after
that they were set / the holy abbot Joseph entered in to his celle / and
cladde him with old clothes all to rent / and came and satte down in the
myddle between they^ both without saying any thing. After he aroos and returned
in to his celle / and took his former clothes that he had / and came again and
satt down between they^. Of which thing they being admeruaylled of that which
he had done asked of him saying / Fader wherefore have ye do this. And he
answered to they^ / have ye well seen all that I have done / and they answered
ye. After he asked they^ / am I changed because I have changed mine habytes
they answered nay. Then said ye holy man. In likewise as I am not changed /
for the chau^gyng of my clothes / ne hurt for to take the better / right so
ought we to be in the coming of our brethern. And to this purpose it is said
in ye gospel. Render or yield ye to god that is to god. And to Cezar yt is to
Cezar. In like wise when we be with our brethern we may make good there / and
receive them in great Joy and gladness without excess. And when they be
absent / and we be allone / we ought to sorrow and bewaylle our sins / then
these brethern seeing yt the holy fader knew their thoughts / and yt which
they would have asked of him / were abashed and praised god.

Thabbot Cassyen said when we came to Palestyne in Egypt / an holy fader
received us in to his lodgys / we being comen in to his house demanded and
asked hy^. Fader wherefore kepest not you the rule of fasting / when thou
receyuest any of thy brethern / like as they do in Palestyne / ye holy man
answered. I have always fasted after my power / and allone with my self. And
how well ye fasting is prouffytable and necessary / yet always it is in our
will / and with yt god commanded us yt we be charytable / wherefore in receyuy^g
you and many other brethern which I see not often I ought to do dylygently yt
which apparteyneth to charity / for wha^ ye shall be departed from me. I shall
mow then fast as I did tofore / see we not yt they yt be boden to the
weddyng of a spouse they being at weddyng ought not to fast / but ye weddyng
and ye fest fynysshed they may well fast / thus in your presence for to
excercyse yt work of very charity I fast not / but in your absence I may well
do it. Furthermore said ye same abbot Cassyan. I and my brethern went to an
other holy old fader / yt which made us to ete and dry^ke enough / and
netheles yet he enforced us to ete more. Then I answered to hy^ for my self
and for the other. fader we thank you / we have eten suffycyently. it is
seefull yt we ete not so often. The holy man answered I have this day leyd ye
table six times to my friends yt ar come for to see me. and I have six times
eten with they^ / and yet always have I hu^gre. wherefore I am abashed how ye be
so soon full which have not eten but only ones. In this party sayen the
holy doctors yt we ought not to follow this rule. For yt which was virtue to
they^ / is or shall be vice to many of us. A commandment general then was
given in ye royame of Sychye / yt every man should fast an hole weke / and yt
ye fest of ester should be hallowed in the same weke. Now it happed yt during ye
same some brethern of egypt came^ to thabbot Moses for to vysyte hy^ / yt
which made to they^ a little potage and a pytau^ce for to sustain they^.
co^syderyng yt they were weary and trauaylled of their way. and in dyghtyng and
dressyng ye said pytau^ce / ye savor and fumee thereof spredde all about.
then the neighbors not knowing ye cause. and ready to say evil sooner than
well / went to ye prestes and clerks of ye next church say^g yt habbot Moses
yt was reputed so holy a man had broken and vyolated ye general commandment
for he fasted not yt weke / the which thing was enough apparau^t as they said
/ because he had ordained and dressed diverse metes. The pres^ knowy^g of yt
one side ye good life of ye said abbot / and of ye other side yt folysshe believe
of ye people answerde / we shall speak to him when he comes to church. and ye
saterdaye after when ye holy abbot was within ye church ye pressed began to say
to hy^. O holy abbot you have offended as touching of men / but as toward god
you have kept his co^mau^d right constantly. Here may be noted a thing much
necessary to be kept / yt is yt a person of ye church in time of fasty^ge
ought not to ete to fore the simple people and ygnorau^^ in any manner. For by
their imprudence and folly / they Judge it in to evil / where he that so shall
be noted may do it lawfully and for a good entente / as for cause of sickness
or other necessyte.

A brother came to thabbot Pastor ye second weke of lent / and in declaryng to
hy^ his thoughtis / found in hy^ some rest of conscience / then said the
brother to hy^ I had thought to have dyfferred this day for to have come to the
for little thing. The abbot asked hy^ wherefore / ye brother answered. I doubted
by cause yt it was lent yt the yate should not have be opened. Then said to
hy^ the abbot we have not be acustomed to shette the yate / by ye which men
enter herin / but we desire more besyly to close and shette the yate of yt
tongue. As who would say that it is more vayllable to close and refrain his
tongue from spekyng in time and place / than to close and shette the materyall
door of his house.

A brother said to thabbot Pastor / if I give any thing to my neighbor / anon
ye devil tempts me with ye sin of vain glory / wherefore I dread to do
alms The holy man answered / we ought to socour the necessyte of our
neighbors for ye love of god. The same old fader said to ye brother one such
a parable. Two men laborers dwelled in a cite / of the which ye one of that
he had sown gadred but little good thereof / and yet yt which he had gadred
was not very clean. That other did sow nothing / and also he gadred nothy^ge.
I ask the then if it so happed yt there came an honger or famyne / which of
these might best escape this danger The brother answered yt he yt had sown and
gadred. Then said ye holy man like wise we ought to sow good works / to
the end yt ye time of famyne being come / yt is to say / yt we may no more
deserve / ye which thing then we would have done and may not recouuer it /
that we deye not eternally.

An other brother came to speak to a good fader / and in departing from hy^
because he had supposed to have let hy^ said to hy^. Fader pardo^ne me / for
I have let yt in thy rule and manner to live relygyously / to whom ye holy
man answered. you have not let me in my rule. for acordyng to the same I
ought in good charity and mercy receive all comers. A man much solytary and
strayt of living / and ye occupied hy^self in excercyse of diverse works
dwelled nygh by a monastery in which were a great multitude of bredern / and
sometime it happed yt they yt went to vysyte came unto this holy man which was
so much solytary. and they constrained hy^ to ete above ye hour determined.
after yt they asked hy^ sayng fader art not you wroth because you etest to fothyn
hour / and he answered. I am never wroth / but wha^ I do after mine own will.
and for asmoche as I do this contrary and against my will I am nothy^g wroth ne
sorry therefore. There was in Syrye upon yt way of deserts an old man which had
a custom to receive all ye relygyous persons yt passed by yt way. On a time
among ye other passed a much so lytary man. yt which for what prayer yt ye
old fader made / he would not dry^ke ne ete / saying yt in no wise he would
break his fast / but ye holy man sore displesed by cause he would not acorde to
his prayer said to hy^. I pray ye sith you would not ete ne dry^ke with me / at ye
lest yt you wyle hold me company to pray unto god under a tree which is here
by / and of it bow down at my prayer tofore thyn / you shall do yt I shall
require the / the which thing yt holy fader accorded to hy^. Then began he
to pray yt was so strayt in his fasting but ye tree bowed nothing down ward
Then after that other began to pray / and all suddenly ye tree bowed it down
/ ye seeing yt other / he obte^pred and obeyed to his words / and praised god
both together of the caas yt was to they^ happed.

Two relygyous persons came to an holy man / yt which had of custom not to
ete of all ye long day / but when he saw they^ he was much Joyous / and
said to they^ / the fasting has his reward. For who ye eteth for charity / he
acco^plyssheth two commandment / for he leueth his own will / and
accomplyssheth the commandment of god in fedyng and refresshyng his brethern.

A relygyous man of Thebes had received of god such a grace / yt he might give
to all Indygent and nedy yt which was to them necessary. One time among
the other as he did his alms in a street / he saw tofore hy^ for to have
some thing / a woman clothed with old clothes all to rent yt it was pity to
see. The relygyous man having on her co^passyon / took his ho^de full of money
wenyng to have gyu^ it to ye said woman / but by ye grace of god / his hand
closed and might give to ye woman but a little part thereof / whereby it appeared
yt she was not so indygent / as it appeared withoutforth. And after yt there came
an other woman well clothed / and when be saw her / he said in himself / this
person had no need and took in his ho^de a little alms for to give to her /
but in openyng his hand she took more than he had put in / in sygnefyeng yt
this woman was more indygent than her clothes shows withoutforth. Then he
meruaylled much / and inquired of ye astate of these two wy^men / and he fond
yt this woman that was well clothed was of great kynne / and was fallen in
pouerte / and for yt cause she was ashamed for to be evil clothed / but ye
other was so clad for to moeue the people for to give to her their alms. And
now in these days over al ye world be many such abusyde and therefore it is
not evil said / see well to whom yt gyuest / for oftymes men give to hy^ yt is
rycher than he yt gives / how be it yt men suppose by cause he is evil clothed
that he has no thing.

There was a relygyous man which had a brother seculer / yt which was much
poor / and all yt ye relygyous man might wy^ne he delivered to hy^ / but how
much more he gaf to hy^ / ye more poor he was / of which thing yt relygyous
meruaylled / and declared it unto a good holy man / which said to hy^ in this
manner if you wylt believe me give to hy^ no more / and when he shall come to ye /
say to hy^. My brother why^e I had any good. I gaaf it to yt / therefore labor
now / and of yt you wy^nest send to me for my dinner / and when any thing he
shall bring to the give it to pylgryms / or to some old poor person / and
warn they^ that they pray for thy brother. The relygyous man concluded for to
do so as like as ye holy man had said to hy^. So then after his brother came to
hy^ desyryng his help as he had be acustomed. To whom he answered / my brother
I can give to yt no more / for I am becomen all poor / now it is need yt ye
labor and bring to me some thing for to socour me / the which answer herd /
the seculer departed all troubled / and a day after he brought his brother some
worte cooles of his gardy^ / and his brother gaf to hy^ his blessy^g / and he
gaf and dystrybuted it to the poor nedy and in dyge^t / prayeng they^ yt they
would pray for his brother. The second day after he came again / and brought mo
cooles and three loves of bread / which he took and gaaf to hy^ his blessyng as
he did tofore / ye third day he came again and brought great quantyte of mete
of wyn and of fysshe This seeing his brother meruaylled thereof / and called a
great multitude of poor people and fed they^. After he asked of his brother
if he had any need of bread or of wyn / to whom he answered nay in saying to
hy^ / when you gave to me of thy goods / all yt I took was incontinent
consumed / like as the fire had burnt it in my house / but sith I gaaf to yt
of my goods / they be multyplyed meruayllously by ye benedycco^n of god Thus
then ye relygyous man heryng thanswere of his brother / went and told the
caa^ to an holy fader which said to hy^ know you not well / yt the goods of
a relygyous man ben as fire / and over all where as they enter and come they
consume all. I assure the yt it is well necessary and prouffytable to thy
brother to live of his labor / and to do alms to the end yt they pray for
him / and that his goods be multeplyed.

There was a man yt did much alms / but yt devil having envy there of /
for to let the reward to hy^ of his good deeds / brought in to his thought a
multitude of scrupulous and remorse of conscience / and among all other camto
hy^ a wydowe askyng for the love of god a little whete / to who^ he said yt she
should bry^g a mesure / and take as much as she should need / netheles he
mesure the whete himself / but when it was put in the sack / he began to say
that there was more than.iiij. busshellis and made ye woman greatly ashamed.
That seeing an holy man yt was by / and began to axe of the man yt made yt
alms / haste you lent or should this whete to this woman to whom he answered
yt he had given it Then go say to her yt you have given it to her all /
wherefore make you dyffyculte of a little / for ye devil would that this man
should let his reward.

An old man much merciful / and a another man lived to gydre a certain time
/ during the which there fill a great hunger and famyne. The poor people
knowing ye great pity and mercy of this man / camen from all costs to hy^ for
to have his alms. And to all them that came for socour / he gaaf bread / but
that other brother seeing that / said to him. Fader give to me my part of ye
goods / and after of thy part do as thou wylt. Then this pytefull man of
his part did alms as he did to fore. And for that cause Infenyte
multitude of people came to him / wherefore our lord seeing his good purpose /
blessed the bread of this holy man / and multeplyed in such wise that he had
enough always for them that came / and it mynysshed not. That other brother
that did none alms / ete all his bread / and when he saw that he had
nothing / he said to ye holy fader Alas if it please you let us live togydre
as we did to fore / to whom the holy fader said that he would well / and so
they were to gydre as they had been tofore / and anon the hu^gre cessed / and
was great habundau^ce of goods / but notwithstondyng ye poor people came^
always for to have alms One day among the other came a poor man askyng alms
/ then the holy fader said to ye same brother yt he should give bread to ye
poor man / ye brother seeing that he had no bread / answered that he had none
to give / the holy man said to hy^ go in and look and seche / wha^ he was
entered in / he saw the chestes all full of bread / and therefore praysyng god
for this miracle / gaaf to the poor what they asked / and had ever after ye
holy man in great reverence.

Here follows a little treatise of obeyssau^ce or obedyence.


THe holy scripture recou^teth to us ye obedyence is better than sacrefyce.
Therefore in this book is determined of this virtue by many example / of which
the first is this. Thabbot Arsenye said on a time to thabbot Alysander / as
soon as you have done thy work come to me / and we shall dyne togydre / but
and it hap by adventure ye any pylgryms come / abide and ete with they^
hardyly / ye hour of dinner comen / ye holy man Alysander which had not
achyeued his work for to obey ye word of Arseny / abode till he had done /
and Arsenye seeing yt ye hour was passed said. I believe yt Alysander have
pylgryms with hy^ sith yt he comes not / and so ye holy man went to dinner /
when Alysander had done / which was about mydnyght / he went to thabbot
Arseny which said to hy^. I suppose Alysander yt you have had this day
pylgryms. Alysander answered. Fader I have had none / but I have done as much
as I may for to come to yt as soon as I might / when I had achyeued my work
like as you co^mau^dest me. Then Arsenye was much abashed how this man was
so obedyent / and began to say. I command yt ye a another time you be not so
long in thy work / but go pray god and do thyn other bodily necessytees /
for there might ensyewe thereof some danger to thy body. Thabbot Abraham and
thabbot Aram were on a time together and there came a brother unto they^ and axed
thabbot Aram what thy^g he might do for to be saved / to who^ ye holy man
a^swerd go in to thy celle / and all this year ete only at even bread and salt
/ and after com again to me at end of ye year / and I shall tell yt what you
shall then do. This brother went his way and did this penance all an hole
year / and after came again to Ara^ and it happed that the said Abraham was with
hy^ at ye same time. Then said to hy^ thabbot Aram return again and fast yet
this year / and after ye ete twyes on ye day / ye which answer herd / he went
his way. After this abbot Abraham said in Aram / ye gyuest but light penance
to the other brethern / but you chargest strongly this brother here / wherefore
do you it / the holy man answered to hy^. The other brethern be not very
servants of god / and therefore as they comen to me / so goon they away / but
this brother is a great servant of god / and all that I shall ^aye to him / he
shall do it And therefore because his glory be encreaced and augmented I give to
him this penance. And here may be noted / that he that enjoined penance /
ought somewhat to know the condyco^n of the person / to whom he enioyneth / if
he will that it be helthfull.

Thabbot Johan which was of little stature / and much great in virtue went
on a time in to Sychye for to see an old holy fader which dwelled in an
hermytage / whom in vysytyng ye said abbot Johan took a dry stake and planted
it / and after said to ye holy old fader / that he should watre every day the
dry slake unto the time hit bare fruit. Now was ye water so far fro
thermytage / yt when thermyte departed on ye even for to fetch water / he
could not come again till on the morrow / and always for tobeye that / the which
thabbot Johan had commanded hy^ / he went every day and fette water / and so
long co^tynued to watre the dry stake / yt after three year it began to wexe
grene and bare fruit. Then there myte took of that fruit and bare it to his
brethern in the church saying. Take ye here of the fruit of obeyssau^ce. Here
may we note what virtue has obeyssau^ce / for it is a thing against nature /
that a dry stock or tree should wexe grene and bear fruit. Thabbot Paulus had
a dyscyple named John^ which was much obeyssau^^ / and ye which was in a
place deserte and full of wode / in which wode dwelled a cruel lion. The holy
man seeing ye croces of this best nyghe by his celle said to his discyple / go
and bring to me tho croces there / ye dyscyple asked how he might take they^
for ye lion / and ye holy man lawhyng said to hy^ / if he come to the / bind
hy^ there and bring him to me / at even ye dyscyple went in to ye forest for
to find ye lion and to bind hy^ as his master had commanded hy^. And anon
this best came against him / but the lion had so great fere yt he fled away.
The dyscyple went after cryeng / abide lion / for my master has commanded
me yt I should bind the / then ye lion abode and tarried and there ye
dyscyple bond hy^ and brought hy^ to ye holy man / ye which seeing this thing
was much strongly admeruayled / and he beat his dyscyple saying to hy^ Fooll
yt you art / bryngest you here this wild euraged be / then after he vnbonde
hy^ and sete hy^ go. By ye which example it apperyth manyfestly yt obeyssau^ce
is great and lowable virtue.

Thabbot Syluayn had in Sychye a dyscyple much obeyssau^t the which was
called Mark and was a writer / his master for his obeyssau^ce loved hy^
better than ye other.xi. dyscyples yt he had whereof they were much angry / and
in like wise were ylle content all ye old faders his neighbors / the which
on a day camen for to see him in his celle. And after went Syluayn and they
with hy^ and knocked on ye celles of his discyples calling and saying yt they
should come in contynent for he had to do with them But there was not one that
anon followed hy^. Then after he came and knocked at the door of Mark / and
inco^tynent as he herd that it was his abbot / he went out to him / and his
abbot sent hy^ forth to do some thing necessary / and lokyng about hy^ he
saw none of his other dyscyples. After he entered and went in to the celle of
ye said Mark / where as he fond that in writing he had begone an. o. but he
had not leyser for tachyeue it for to come to him / and was but half written.
Then said the old fader. Certainly we love him / that you love / for we see
that god loves hy^ The mother of ye said Mark came on a time for to see him /
and required his abbot that she might speak to him / and that she was come to
see him / the which thing thabbot granted to her. And he went to the said
Mark and said to him that he should go out of his celle and speak to his mother
which was come to see him. Then for to obey his abbot he went out in an
old robe all to broken and pyeced / and was all black of the smoke and ordure
/ in such wise that she could not know him / and in closing his eyes he
began to say to her / god keep you in health / his mother which supposed not
that it was be. Incontinent she returned again unto thabbot prayeng him as
before is said that he would send to her / her sone / to the end yt she might
see him. And obtemperyng to the which / thabbot went again to the said merke
and said to him / have I not said to the that you sholdest go speak to thy mother
/ the which answered. I have spoken to her fair fader and have grette and
salewed her / and therefore I pray you that ye command me no more that I go
forth / for fere yt I be not dysobeyssau^t. This answer herd / ye holy man
went out and said to the mother / that it was her sone that had salewed her
once in sayng to her goo keep you in health / and he conforted her and so made
her to return.

Four brethern which were cladde in robes of skynnes camen in to Sychye to
thabbot Pambo / and in declaryng to him each of them in thabsence of the other
their manners of living / and asked of him which of them by his advise had
most solytaryly and merytoryously lived. The first had fasted long time.
That other had never had any thing propre. The thrydde had be much
charytable. And the fourth had.xxij. year during be obeyssaunt unto an holy
man. Then said thabbot Pambo yt he which had observed ye virtue of obedyence
/ had most meryted / and that eueryche of the other three / had lived in
vsyng their own will / but ye fourth for ye honor of god had always obeyed
ye will of an other in withstandyng his own. Thus it appears that obedyence
is more gretter virtue than abstynence / charity / and pouerte / and such so
obedyent ben very confessors if they deye in this manner.

A seculer man which was of Thebes moeued of the holy ghost / came to thabbot
Sysoys saying that he desired and would be a monk / and prayed that he might
be received in to his monastery the holy man asked hy^ if he had any thing in
the world. The seculer answered that he had a sone / then said to him
thabbot temptyng him in his obeyssau^ce / go and cast him in to the water / or
else you shall not be a relygyous man. Then ye same man went forth for to do
the commandment of the abbot / the which after he had seen his prompte
obedyence / send him word by a brother that he should not do it. And as ye
brother came to him / he fond him on the bring of the river / and he asked
what he did there. I do said he that which my abbot has commanded me. For
he said to me that I should cast my sone in to the water. Then said to him the
brother that thabbot had sent to him word that he should cease. And so he
ceased and was received in to that monastery wherein he lived right holyly. We
have a like example of Abraham / to whom for to see his obeyssau^ce / god
commanded to slay Ysaac his sone / the which thing he would have do / if the
angel had not retained the stroke of his sword.

Saint Syncletyce said that obeyssau^ce is more to praise than contynence. For
to contynence is somewhat anneyed arrogau^ce / but very obeyssau^ce is founded
in all humylyte. The same saint Syncletyce said / it behooves to us to govern
our soul with great dyscreco^n. And if we be with some other / we ought not to
do after our desire / but after their will / provided yt they be well ruled.
For as people ba^nysshed and exyled out of their contrees / we have given over
and left for thonour of god / and to this end we ben separate and departed
from the world. And this ought to be vnderstonden of ye relygyous people that
have renou^ced the world and their propre will. For it behooves they^ to do
after the will of their prelate. And therefore said the said saint Syncletyce.
Let us seche no thing more of the place / fro which we be departed / we have
in the world vain glory / and habondau^ce of goods / but here with great
dyffyculte have we bread / like as she would say. It behooves in relygyon to
endure many Indygences for the honor of god.

Thabbot Ypericius said that thoffyce of a monk is obeyssaunce. For a man that
is obedyent shall obtain of god all that which he shall demand Our savior
and redemer Ihesu christ by the virtue of obeyssau^ce is come unto the cross.
For the church syngeth of hy^ / that he is made obedyent unto the death of the
cross / for to redeem us fro the pains of hell. Thus then may be said /
that among all other virtues a relygyous person ought pryncypaly to have the
virtue of obedyence.

The holy faders sayden that / if a man have affyaunce to a another / and he
submytted him in his subieccyon / he ought to do all that which that other
shall command him / so yt it be a thing Just and honest. For in so doing he
shall not run in to the ire ne Indygnaco^n of god.

The holy aeged men sayden ye god volde yt we should obey to holy scryptures.
For in them is contained ye manner and form to live and do vertuos
operaco^ns. And also we ought to obey to our sovereign prelates.

A brother of Sychye wyllyng to go to heruest / in the season when the corn and
graynes be gadred in came to an holy man and said to him. Fader say to me what
I ought to do. The holy fader answered. If I tell the what thou sholdest do /
will thou do it. The brother said ye fader. I shall obey all thy
commandments.

Then said ye holy man / if thou wylt believe me / go and renounce this work
of harvest / and after come again to me and I shall say what thou shall do.
Thus the brother byleuyng his counseyll forsook the work of harvest and came
again to the holy fader. And the holy fader said to him / goo and fast fyfty
days in thy celle / and ete but ones on the day oonly bread and salt. And
when that thou shall have done that. I shall say to the afterward what thou
shall do. The brother departed with all humylyte and dread and did his
penance. And the fyfty days passed / he came again to the holy fader / which
said to him all the manner how he ought to live in his celle. In showing to him
his defaultes. And forthwith the said brother departed and went in to his
celle. And fylle down to the earth where he contynuelly be wept his sins
three days and three nyghtes. But the fend our enemy desyryng to make him to
fall in to the sin of vain glory reduyced to his mind / how he had
surmounted his passions / to the end that he should gloryfye in him self /
and that he should say in him self / that he was ryghtfull and Just. But for
to take away this temptacyon he thought on his sins the which he had
commysed / and said. Helas where ben all the great and terryble sins / that
I have done. And thus eschewed the first temptacyon.

Furthermore thenemye seeing that he might not have him by vain glory /
began to tempte him with Impacyence / in bryngyng to fore his mind all the
euylles / and sins that he had done / to the end that he should fall in
despair. And for to eschew that / the brother in this temptacyon said. I
believe that god is all merciful / wherefore I have good and steadfast hope /
that he shall pardonne me / And in this wise he overcome the second temptacyon.

Then after the fendes as all enraged appyered vysybly to him saying / we ben
vaynquysshed and ouercomen of the. Then the brother asked and demanded them
whereof / And they answered / if we tempte the any thing with vain glory /
thou humblest thy self all that thou may in reducyng to fore thyn eyes thy
great and evil sins. And if we tempte the for to put thy self in
despair. anon thou ouercomest us / and enhau^ceste thy self by hope / which
thou haste in the right great mercy of god / and thus we be always vaynquysshed.

The holy faders sayden that god demanded no thing of man but obedyence.

An holy man being much solytarye had a fermour which dwelled in a ferme
of his. And the fermour delivered to him that which was necessary On a time it
happed that vytaylles taylled to this holy man / for his fermour came not to him
as he had be accustomed. The holy man some what gryeued said to his dyscyple /
wylt thou goo to our ferme for to say to our fermour that he come to us.

The dyscyple answered. Fader I shall do that shall please the / but the holy
man dyfferred it / and durst not send his dyscyple out. Nevertheless after
that he had abyden long / he demanded again and asked his dyscyple if he
would goo thither that he had said. The dyscyple which dredde to goo out /
doubtyng to be surprysed of the fend said to him / that he should gladly do
that should please him. And nevertheless dredyng to dysobeye him went thither.
Then said the holy man to him / My friend be thou assured / for I believe that
god shall deliver the from thy temptacyons / and they put them to prayer both
to gydre. And that done the dyscyple went unto the ferme / where he found no
person to speak to / for the fermour and all his famyllye were gone out to
make good there with their friends / and there was none left at home but one
of his daughters / the which kept her self within the yate shytte. This
brother knocked at the yate / the which yate was opened to him by the said
daughter. And how well that he would not enter and goo in. Nevertheless she
being tempted of the fend made him to enter in / and she began to excyte and
to moeue him as much as she might by words and touching unto the dyshonest
sin of the flesh. Wherefore he began to cry saying. A lord god deliver
thou me from this woman / by the moyen of the holy prayers of mine holy fader.
And those words said / anon he was taken away / and found him self by a
River / by the which the way lay to goo to his monasterye. And thus he was
delivered entyerly by the prayers of the holy man / the which prayers because
of his obedyence preserved him from that Inconuenyent.

Two brethern germayn / that is to say born of one fader and one mother dwelled
in a Relygyon / that one of them was much obedyent. And that other much
sobre. The first did promptly and redely all that was said to him / wherefore
the abbot had good opinion of him and loved him better than that other.
Then the devil that seaceth not but to so we cockle and dyscorde / specially
among virtuous people / tempted one of the said brethern with the sin of
envy against his brother / by cause that the abbot loved one more than him /
the which said to him self. I shall preue and know right soon if my
brother be very obedyent. And went to the abbot / and prayed him that he would
suffer hs brother to hold him company in a certain thing that he had to
do / in which the abbot accorded to him. Then they went to gydre. And he
that was much sobre willing to proeue the obedyence of his brother / they
being nyghe to a River full of venomous bestes said to his brother that he
should goo in to that water. And Incontinent he entered in to it but the
venomous bestes did him none harm / but lycked his feet / that seeing he that
was sobre that the bestes had done to him no gryef / said to him that he
should come out / and so he did. Then afterward as they walked they fond
the corpse of a deed man. Then said he that was sobre / if we had here any
old thing / we would couere this body. To whom he that was obedyent said. It
were better that we prayed unto god that he would reyse him from death to life.
Then they both fylle down and began to pray. And anon the deed body was
raised to life. Then Incontinent he that was sobre began to gloryfye him
self / saying secretly to him self that this deed body was raised for his
great abstynence / and no thing for the obedyence of his brother But god
which suffers not always the evil to regne above the good / and that also he
will not that the troth be hid. Wherefore he showed this caas to the abbot of
their monasterye. And how he that was sobre was tempted against his brother by
envy / wenynge to have made him to be devoured by venyme in the water. They
being comen in to the monasterye. The abbot demanded and asked of him that was
enuyous / wherefore he had tempted so his brother. In saying to him
furthermore these words. I will well that thou know that for the obedyence of
thy brother the deed body is raised to life / and no thing for thyn
abstynence.

A seculer man having three sons / came and rendered him in to Relygyon and left
his childern in the cite wherein he dwelled. And after that he had been three year
in the monasterye / there came to him Infenyte dyspleasyrs for his childern the
which he had so left. Now thabbot knew nothing that he had any
childern. For when he came in to the relygyon he had nothing said thereof. But
he knew well by outward signs / that he was dyspleased of some thing. And
so demanded and asked of him what him eyled saying to him. My brother
wherefore art thou so heavy and sorrowful. The brother answered Helas fader I
had three childern in the world when I came hither. I would well bring them
hither if it were thy pleasyr. Then said the abbot to him that he was well
content / and that he should goo fetch them. The Relygyous brother greatly
enjoyed of this answer / went in to the cite for to bring the three childern
/ but when he came thither he found that two of them were deed long before /
and had but one sone living / whom he brought with him to the monasterye
after the commandment of his abbot. And when he was come / he demanded after
his abbot / and it was said to him that he was not there / but was goon to the
oven. And he went forth Incontinent toward him bringing with him his child
whom the abbot saw gladdely / and enbraced and kyssed him many times in sign
of great love and of fervent dyleccyon that he had in him. After he demanded
and asked of the childs fader / if he loved well this child. And he answered
/ ye / And yet again he asked and demanded him love thou well thy sone /
and he answered to him as before / that ye / Then said the abbot to him / take
him and cast him in to the oven whiles it is hoot. And he took his child and
threw him in to the mids of the fire. But the heet of the fire was by
miracle made soft and cold as a dew. And hurted not the child in any wise.
Then the said brother was renommed through all the Relygyon / like as was the
holy Patryarke Abraham / when he unto our lord would have sacrefyed his sone
Ysaac.

It was demanded and asked of an holy man / that which had more merit / of
him that dwelled with the Relygyouses / and is obedyente in all things to
them / or he that dwells in an hermytage there living solytaryly without any
company.

The holy man said that he that is with the Relygyouses / and to them is
obedyent in all things. For he does no thing after his owen will / but all
that he does is at the will of other. But he that is in the hermytage / how
well that he be much solytarye / yet always he uses his own will / and is
not subget to any person.

An holy man said that in heaven was showed to him four ordres and manners of
people. The first order was of seek men / which had in pacyence their
maladyes and sekenesses / and gloryfyed god and his saints. The second was of
them that had gladdly received pylgryms for the worship of god / and they
were called hostelers. The third order was of them that dwelled in deserts /
and saw not the world / and lived in the said deserts in straytnes of
penance. The fourth order was of them that for the honor of god submytted
them to their faders spyrytuell / and were in all things to them obedyent.
But among the four ordres / they that had be obedyent were adorned and arrayde
with fair colors of precious stones / and crowned with crowns of gold / and
had more Joy than the other three ordres. Yet the same holy man said
furthermore / that he had asked and demanded of him that had showed to him
these ordres / how it might be that the said order of obedyence had most
glory / seen that it was among the other less. For it seems the virtue of
obedyence to be a little virtue. To whom it was answered. That not without
cause they that were obedyent had the most grettest glory. For they that
receive the pilgrims do that charity after their own will. And the hermytes
that goon in to their hermytage / and renounce the world / do it of their
free will. But they that be obedyent / have no propre will. For for the
honor of god they have submysed all their will to the will of their
soueraynes / wherefore they have in heaven grettest glory. And therefore it is
openly known that the virtue of obedyence is for to be reco^mended among all
other virtues. And therefore every person ought tenforce him to his power to
follow it.

It is found that for five reasons obedyence ought more to be chosen / than
the other vertuers. The first for it is cause of the health of the very true
christian men / and keeps the virtues. The second for it is that techeth to the
Royame of heaven. The third for it opens the yate of heaven. It also
enhau^ceth the men fro the earth / that is to sayt from things erthely and
worldly unto heavenly things. The fourth reason for it abides in heaven with
the blessed angellys / which always be obedyent to god. The fyfth reason / for
it is all the desire of ye saints of heaven. For by very obedyence many comen
unto the heavenly glory.

Here follows an other little treatise encytyng the people unto the right
necessary virtue of humylyte and meekness. And begins in latin. Abbas
Anthonius.


AFter that in the chapter precedent has be made menco^n of the virtue of
obedyence / follows now couenably of the virtue of humylyte. In the which
consysteth the perfeccyon of every virtue / upon which it ought first to be
noted / that in this little treatise be comprysed some prouffytable dyctes and
proverbs of holy faders. By the consyderacyon of which every person of what
someuer astate or condycyon that he be may learn lightly the very way of
humylyte And first here is contained one of the causes / by the which saint
Anthonye kept him from ouermoche enquyryng of the secret Iugemens of god / in
humblynge him self as indygne and unworthy to know the lest of the dyuyne
secrets celestyall. For he being in a profounde medytacyon / as meruayllynge
him self of the dyuyne Iugemens made such a request unto god. That is to
wit / that he would show to him if it pleased him / wherefore it was so that
some lived so ly^^ a while / and some other above naturell aege. From whens
proceeds and / that some for any labor that he takes / may no thing have
ne get. And other without labor and to have pain / have all the goods of
the world. And pryncypally they that be Unjust have all the earth in
possessyon And the good and virtuous have no thing but maledyccyon /
mendycyte / and pouerte. Then the said Anthonye herd a voys that said to
him. Anthonye think on thy self / and sight not for the deeds of an other /
for ye pleasyr of god is that / of which thou wa^ ^^^tolyest thy self to be
so done / know ye that his Iugemens be as a great and a deep abysme. The
secrets of god which he will hyde / a man ought not tenquyre.

The said holy fader Anthonye said to thabbot Pastor. It is a great work in a
man / that without to Iustefye him self / he accuse him to fore god of his
sins. And with yt he be strong and constau^t to withsta^de all temptacyon /
as steadfastly concluded never to defoyle the law of god / and that unto the
last end of his death.

Also yet said the holy fader Anthonye / that he had seen all the grynnes of
the devil stratched and leyde over all the earth. And in seeing began to wept
in great teres saying. Ha ha my god who shall be he / the which shall eschew
to be taken in one of these grynnes. Then he herd a voys that said to him
Anthonye that shall be he that shall be garnysshed with one fight humylyte /
the which is ye / without the which no virtue is pa^^ (...) Some ancient
faders among (...) which was the abbot named Joseph vysy^^den the said Saint
Anthonye. And they being comen to him he asked them / and first the yongeste
in making unto them some proposycyons of holy scripture. The same young
brethern / wenynge to have done well / answered to him in expownynge his
questyon. To whom together he answered saying to them / yet have ye not found
that which ye ought to know. After he turned him toward the abbot Joseph /
and in like wise he demanded him a questyon of the holy scripture / the which
abbot answered to hy^ saying hy^ self unworthy to expowne the (...)
proposyco^n of the holy scripture / and that he knew not what it was to say /
that which the said saint Anthonye had demanded him. Then saint Anthonye
said to him / that he ^on^y had found the yate of humylyte / for in spekyng of
the holy scripture ought noman to gloryfye him / but rather to meke and humble
him.

Thabbot Arsenye being allone in his celle / the deuylles camen sometime for to
let him of his contemplaco^ns On a time among the other they came at ye hour /
when the brethern brought him his refeccyon corporal. And they taryeng at the
door herd the said abbot cryeng with an hye voys and saying My god leave me not
without thy mercy. And because I never did deed meryth^ryous. I pray the give
me grace that now I may entrepryse the beginning of helthfull life. And this
said (...) humylyte / ^ow he it he had so (...) led a right parfyght ly^^. Of
the same holy abbot Arsenye recounten his brethern / that when he was in the
palace of the emperor / there was none cladde with more precious Robes than he.
And countrarye when he was Relygyous for to more to meke and humble him self /
he cladde him with the most vile clothing and more course than all ye other.
He asked on a time of an old fader of Egypt what thoughts and medytacyons he
ought to have for to live holyly. The which old fader answered to him saying.
Arsenye I meruaylle me how thou that art a clerk / and knowing the grekysshe
lettres and latin / demau^dest such a questyon of me that am a rude man / and
that can not dyscerne between sin and virtue. Then the holy fader Arsenye
co^syderyng his humylyte said to him these words. I have known the laws and
tradyco^ns latyne and greek But yet knew I never the.a.b.c. of such a rude
man yt is no clerk / when he spacke / his speech was sorrowful / and when he
was still and spacke not / it was to him gladness.

When thabbot Pastor herd tidings of his death / he said of him these words.
Thou art well happy fader Arsenye / for you have wept and bewailed thy self in
this world. As who should say / he that bewayleth and ben epeth not his
sins in this world mortal / in doing penytence / he shall bewept hy^
incessau^tly in torment everlasting. An holy fader named Danyell witnesses of
the said holy fader Arsenye many fair rewles of his holy conuersacyon. First
the said abbot Arsenye presumed never to speak any questyon doubtouse touching
holy scripture. Secondely be wrote not gladly any lettres myschyef to his
Relygyous brethern. And when he had be long out of his covent / and was come
again to the church / he showed not him self / but put him self behind a
pyler by cause he would not be seen / and also that he should see none other.
Notwithstanding that his face was angelyke and pleasant as the face of Jacob.

Thauncyent faders rehercen that some relygyous brethern presented they^ self
to fore thabbot Ammon / to the end that he should Judge some questyon moeued
among them. But the good fader Ammon dyssymyled and would Judge no person.
That seeing a woman she said to an other yt was by her. My neighbor take heed
and see this fair fader which is all a fooll. Thus as she said these words /
ye said Ammon understood it / and said to her. My friend how long wenest you yt
I have had pains and labors in deserte for to get this fatuyte and folly.
And for thoccasyon of the / yt is to wyce for thy Iniuryouses I should have
this day lost it. As who said / yt if I had not endured pacyently that which
she had said / he had fall in Inpacyence / and by that he had lost the merit
of his penau^ces / if by new penance he had not returned to god. The holy
faders recou^ten yt in the cite of Exyrynque was a bishop named Assus / the
which being a monk to fore he was elect bishop / ladde a right hard and
strayt life. And also well when he was bishop / he would have led such a
life / as yt he had led in his hermytage. Then as desolate / and wenyng to
be out of the grace of ye holy ghost made often his prayer unto god in saying. O
my lord and my god / the dygnyte epyscopall in which I am co^stytued makes me
to be separate from thy love. In so much that I may not do such penaunces as
I was wont to do in deserte. To whom was showed that nay / and that our lord
socoured him more when he was in deserte and in solytude / because that men
might not then help him. But he being a bishop he might have aid and help
of men / wherefore god gaaf not so great consolacyon ne such strength in his
penaunces and strayt living. The abbot Danyell witnesses that in Babylon the
daughter of a prouoost was vexed of a devil the which she had within her
body. The said prouoost had great famylyaryte with a Relygyous man / of whom
he asked often counsel for to know by what moyen his daughter might ben
preserved from this vexacyon dyabolyke. The said monk answered that he knew
no remedy / but the prayers of the holy hermytes living in the deserts. But
by cause that the said monk knew their humylyte / he counseled the said
prouoost that he should awayte when any of them came to the market for to selle
their hottes or paners / and that he should bye th^ym and not pay / but
constrayne him to come to his house for his money. And when he were come / he
should make his daughter demonyake to come to fore him / and then he should
pray hy^ to pray to god for his said daughter / hopyng by this moyen that she
should be heled and restored to her health. And fynably it happed than that an
old hermyte came to the market for to selle his paners. And anon after the
counseyll of the Relygyous man the said prouoost brought him to his house / for
to pay to him there his money for the marchau^dyse that he had bought of
him. And after that the holy fader was entered in to the house / the daughter
being gryeuously tourmented of the devil was presented tofore him. The which
in her great woodnesse gaaf to the said hermyte incontinent a buffet upon his
cheke. The which consyderyng the commandment of our lord Ihesu christ in
his gospel / presented and profred to her that other cheke / to the end that
she should give to him yet an other buffette. The devil which was with in ye
body of the said daughter / when he perceived the great humylyte of the holy
hermyte / by his great pride he could ne might no longer keep ne hold him
within her in the presence of the holy man. But with an hye voys cried by the
mouth of the said daughter saying. O vyolente and wonderful obseruacyon of
the commandments of god / by the which I am constrained to depart out of
the body of the which I have been so long time possessour. Anon forthwith
the devil departed and vanysshed away / and the said daughter was guarysshed
and made hole. The other relygyous brethern when they knew yt this miracle
had been such done / in gloryfyeng all the name of our lord god saying /
that by the humble obseruacyon of the commandments of Ihesu christ and by
very humylyte / the pride of the devil was put done. For certaynely all
they that be veraye meke and humble / the devil of hell shall never have
power for to possess them. And therefore said the abbot Euagrius that the
commandment of health is meekness to repreue in him self / in correctyng
his vices and wyckednesses.

The abbot Serapyon in praysyng the virtue of humylyte in the person of one
his dyscyple named Zacharye said. I have made many abstynences bodily / and
more without co^paryson than my sone Zacharye. And yet might I never come to
his humylyte / another to his obseruacyon of scylence. By the which words he
gave to understand and to know / that he esteemed the virtue of humylyte to be
more gretter than all the other virtues.

Thabbot Moses demanded and asked counseyll of this brother Zacharye / how he
might live for to get the Royame of heaven. The said Zacharye heryng this
demand / anon by great humylyte fylle down to the fete of the said abbot
Moses in saying Alas my fader ask thou counseyll of me / as who should say
/ that he was more virtuous and more prudent than he without comparyson. The
said Moses then answered to him My brother I know that the grace of the
holy ghost habou^deth in the. And therefore I am constrained for to demand
and ask of the counseyll for mine health. Then the good brother Zacharye took
of his frocke from his head / and lied down at his feet saying. My fader if a
man be not in this manner humbled he is not worthy to be a monk.

And to this purpose said the abbot Pastor / that the holy abbot Moses being
in the article of ye death demanded and asked of the brother Zacharye what
thing was to a Relygyous man most necessary. And he answered / that it was to
be stylle / and keep scylence. To whom the said Moses answered. My sone it is
true. The man that is stylle and speaks not is to few people noyous / and
when it came to the point that he should give up his ghoost / thabbot Ysydore
which then was present beholding the heaven said Rejoice thy self my sone
Zacharye / for the yates of the kingdom of heaven be opened to the.

Theophyle bishop of Alexandrye a man of great renommee / in passing by the
mount of Nytrye recountred an holy fader which did there his penance. To
whom he made such a questyon. Fair fader I demand of the / what operaco^n is
most fructuous to get sauacyon in living such a life as thou ledest in
deserte. The which answered to him / that it was to blame him self
incessauntly. And by humylyte to repute him self vnwordy ever to have done any
work merytorye. And the said Theophyle answered / that there was none way more
helthfull than that which he had said / for he that humbles and meketh him
self / he shall be of god enhaunceth. And he that enhaunceth him self / shall
be made meke and humble. To this purpose the abbot in etynge with his brethern
in great scylence and reverence took the vessellys to drink / but after the
custom he said not to one ne to an other in taking them brother dysplease you
not. That considering the said abbot Theodore / said to them. My brethern
have lost their noblesse / for they have not great reverence one to an other
in drynkyng and in etyng.

The ancient aeged faders wytnessen of the abbot Theodore / that after yt he
was made deken in thermytage named Sychye / he would not receive the order of
preesthode. And fled now in one place / and now in to a another. But that
notwithstanding the brethern brought him again always saying to him. Abbot
Theodore leave not the dygnyte that thou haste begone to receive. Then he
prayed them to give to him space to pray to god / to the end that his pleasyr
were to show to him / if he were worthy to come to such an office. And thus
as he was in such prayers / there came a pyler of fire touching the earth and
the heaven by his gretenesse. After he herd a voys saying. Theodore if you
myghtest be as this pyler / goo without varyeng and receive the office / that
thy brethern will give the. By the pyler enflammed might be understand charity
/ that is to say very love and dyleccyon / that one ought to have to god / and
to his neighbor. By that that it touches the earth / is sygnefyed very
humylyte. And by that / that the said pyler touched heaven / we may note the
heart brennynge lift up to god by contemplacyon unto heaven / when he had
seen this vysyon / he protested never to receive the said dygnyte / which they
would have made him to take. After he returned to the church with the
Relygyouses / the which as to fore had prayed him at lest to accept the
office and charge to admynystre to them the holy sacraments / and that it
would please him to hold the chalyce. The which thing he refused to do / as
reputing him self unworthy of that dygnyte / in protestynge / if they
departed not fro him to make such requests / that he would never after abide
ne dwell with them. When they had herd his answer / they spacke no more to
him / by cause he should not depart from them against his will.

To this purpose of humylyte said the abbot Johan the little / that the yate by
the which enters in to us our bodies / is humylyte. And by many shames and
blames that the ancient faders have mekely and Ioyously suffered / the Royame
of heaven is to them given.

Yet again he said that humylyte which is the rote of all goods / and dread
of god is the beginning of all good science / exceeding all other virtues.
And therefore said the abbot Johan Thebeyen / that Relygyouse person to fore
all other things ought to have humylyte. For it is the first commandment of
our savior Ihesu Christ / which says in speaking to all christian men. My
chyldern learn of me / for I am meke / and humble in heart. And he him self
says in an other place. Blessed be the meke in speryte / for the kingdom of
heaven is to them.

All the holy faders of the deserte of Sychye on a time being together in a
chapter or congregaco^n general / treated a questyon of Melchysedech priest /
whereof is made menco^n in holy scripture / and in treatyng of this matter / they
remembered of an holy abbot named Coppres much reno^med among them / the
which had not by them be called And then they sent for him. And
Incontinent as he was comen / they asked him his opinion of the questyon
proposed. The which by him herd / he smote his mouth and said / ha Coppres
that which god byddeth the to be done thou have left. And that which he
commands not / thou sekest it by argumentacyon. When the brethern had herd
these words / all confused they returned in to their celles. For by that he
gaaf they^ to understand / that none without great necessyte ought not presume
to inquire over far of yt works of god / very science is to know him self
/ and to do that ought to do / without entremetynge with the fayte of other.

It is found of the holy abbot Macharye that he dwelling in the deserts of
Sychye. On a time as he came from a marys / and bryngyng palms on his neck / a
devil appyered to him in likeness of a man beryng a sithe to shere otes / and
would have smoten hy^ with yt same syche / but he might not because that god
our maker would not suffer it. Then the devil said to him. A Macharye I have
great passions of that I may not overcome the / for all yt thou doste / I do
also / if thou fastest in etyng ones on the day / I ete never / you wakest /
and I sleep never / but nevertheless you surmou^test me with one thing. Then
thabbot Macharye demanded him what thing it was. And be answered that it was
his humylyte / the which kept him from having any power / auctoryte / or
domynacyon on him.

Some holy faders rehersen of thabbot Moses / that after yt he was made priest
/ they cladde him with the tunyke sacerdotall then accustomed to priests.
Then the Archebysshop said to him / behold Moses / by the order of
preesthode thou art made white. And that said he peradventure by cause that
then he was cladde with white. The said abbot humbly answered to him. A my
lord this whytnesse or clennesse is it without forth or within forth. The
said Archebysshop for to preue his humylyte commanded to his servants / when
he offered him self to the altar for to do sacrefyce / that then
incontinent they should cast him out of the church / the which thing they
did saying to him the said servants. Goo out of the Temple Ethyopyen / as
who should say. Old vylayne full of wyckednes. To which words and Iniuryes
be answered not one word / but as spekyng to him self he said. They have well
done myschau^t fooll. For thou that art not a man ought not to repute thy
self worthy to domyne on men under the shadow to excercyse such an office.

The holy abbot Pastor being in a congregacyon of Relygyouse men / herd say
of an holy fader called Nestoryn. And for as much as the said Nestoryn was of
great name and fame. The said Pastor sent unto his abbot / prayeng him that
it would plese him to send to him the said Nestoryn. His abbot dyfferred it by
cause he would not send him allone. Hit happened on a time that the dyspenser
of his covent had in like wise will for to goo vysyte the abbot Pastor for to
take away some scrupules of his conscience. Then yt said Nestoryn asked
license of the said abbot for to goo see and to vysyte the said abbot Pastor.
And so gaaf him leave to goo thither. and gaaf express commandment to the
said dyspencer to bring again with him the said Nestoryn. They tweyne to
gydre departed for to accomplysshe the commandment that was made to them /
and camen to the celle of the said Pastor. To whom the dyspencer declared
first the secrets of his conscience / whereof he was much comforted and
rejoiced by the good exhortaco^ns and admonycyons that the said Pastor made to
him for his health. After these words said / he turned his words to the said
Nestoryn / and asked and demanded of him / how he had gotten so great
prudence that he had. For his custom was such in his monasterye / if any
among them were in dyssencyon or in hate / he entremeted not / and let them
do / as them good seemed / if any said to him any heinous words / he
answered no thing again. His humylyte was so great / that he took all thing
in good / and reputed all his brethern more wise and dyscrete than him self.

The said Nestoryn answered to the said Pastor in this manner. My fader pardonne
me if it please the. I am no thing virtuous as thou sayste. But I shall tell
the / when I entered in to thastate of Relygyon. I said to my self that I
would be semblable and like to a best / which called is an ass / the which
when he is beten says not a word. If any do to him wrong or repreef / he
holds him stylle and says not a word. And this rewle approeued Dauyd in
his psalm when he says in speaking to our lord god. My redemer I have be as
a Iument toward the / that is to say pacyent in all aduersyte.

For to get good and very humylyte thabbot Pastor said / like as he that is or
will be very humble / and have the parfyght dread of god our blessed maker /
ought always without ceassynge to syghe. That is to say to lift his heart on
hye on heavenly things / like as the air that the nose bretheth in and
respyreth out again incessau^tly. And to that purpose he said to them that
demanded him / as a man ought to hold him self in the place wherein he
dwells or babyteth / that in all places he yt will have peace / ought to
repute hy^ as done the strangers yt be far / the which entremete they^ not
soon to gaynsaye to yt which they seen done or said. Like wise also none
ought desire to have audyence in his words above other / for he that will that
one herkene always without ceassyng / is often reputed for a fooll among the
other. Yet he said that he that will have strong armours for his soul against
his aduersarye the devil / he ought never to be proud / ne presume him self
or esteem to be of any valor. And with that he ought to set and put all
his affection and his thought behind his back / that is to say to be very
obeyssaunt to all the operacyons and commandments of his prelates and
soueraynes.

Furthermore he said that none ought to believe fermely his propre opinion /
but ought to use the counseyll and techyng of them that be of holy
conuersacyon and good manners. And therefore a brother asked thabbot Alonius and
demanded him what it was of contennement. Then he said that it was to be
among bestes unreasonable / as they that been in deserte / and that have
renounced all worldly honor. And to that purpose he called the virtue of
humylyte. earth. In the which god our savior will that sacrefyce be made and
accomplysshed. Also after his doctrine and techyng he that excedeth not his
astate shall not be reput^d proud / but he shall be praised and honored of
eueryche / he him self by much great humylyte served the brethern being at
the table / when they took their refeccyon to gydre. And oftentimes the
brethern said often great praysynges of him among them. But nevertheless he
answered to they not one word. And when he was asked and demanded wherefore he
answered to them not in saying some thing / he said for this reason. If I
had answered / it should seem that I were glorious of their praysynges.

The abbot Joseph was on a time with the abbot Pastor and in spekyng togydre of
one named Agathon The said Pastor named him Abba / which is as much to say
as fader. And by cause it was a name of honor and of ancient. The said Joseph
asked for what reason he had called him fader / seen that he was yet much
young. To whom he answerde his tongue / that is to say tacyturnyte / and
prudence in langage made him to deserve to be named fader / for the aege made
him not so to be called / but the virtue. Therefore the said Pastor never
gaynsayde by words with an holy fader / but all their words he enhaunsed and
praised.

In the time that Theophyle bishop of Alexandrye came from you said place of
Alexandrye / in to the deserts of Sychye / the relygyouses for to come speak
to him were assembled / and prayde to an abbot named Pambo / that he would make
a predycacyon at the coming of the said Theophyle for to comfort him in
esperyte. The which answered if he be not well edefyed with my scylence / he
shall be less by my words.

A brother that was named Pystus / and seven other brethern hermytes his
felawes vysyteden thabbot Sysoy dwelling in yt isle which is called Clysmatos /
to whom they prayde / that he would give to they^ some admonyco^ns / by the
which they might be ye better and get their health. To whom he answered My
brethern pardonne me if it please you / for I am not but a best and a Idyote
and without entendeme^t. But I shall recou^te to you yt which I have seen
in.ij. holy faders. That one was named thabbot Or / yt other abbot Atrem yt
which I have vysyted long time for to know their co^uersaco^n / and then
when I was arrived with they^. I prayed they^ in like wise as ye have prayed me /
yt they should give to me some doctrine for my health whereto ye said abbot
answered / brother do here in all that which you shall see done by us here /
other thing can I not say repreche. Thou shall know here my fader Atrem /
which does by the moyen of the grace of god more than he may in all
vyolence. And in like wise does god to all other that enterprise this rule and
manner of living. They were not both of one prouynce. But in them was all
plenytude of grace. And pryncypally Atrem was of great obedyence / and Or of
parfyght humylyte / as it appears fayttes which shall after be said.

On a time a certain man brought a fysshe for to ete / the which thabbot
Atrem would make ready for their dinner. And as he put the knyef in the fysshe
for to deuyde and cut it / the abbot Or began to cry Atrem atrem / and
incontinent the said Atrem left his knyfe within the fysshe without to draw
it out and deuydyng of the fysshe. And the said Atrem ran to the said abbot
Or / without to say that he should tarry till he had appointed the fysshe.
Then demanded the holy fader Sysoy of the said Atrem how he had gotten so
great obedyence / he answered that it was by the merytes of his abbot Or / and
then he knew his obedyence. For the said fysshe was not roasted ne appointed
like as it apperteyned. Notwithstanding the said Atrem would have done it
gladdely to the end / that the said Sysoy should know his obedyence / when they
came to dinner / the said Atrem delivered first a part of the said fysshe but
half soden / the which the said holy fader Or ete in praysyng it as right
good and well appointed. After he presented of the said fysshe to him an other
part / which was not but / but half soden saying. Fader forgive me for this
pyece has been by me evil soden and appointed. The holy fader Or answered. My
brother I believe that thou have done the best that thou coudest do arter thy
power / and therefore it is to me agreeable.

When this was do the said Atrem spacke to the said Sysoy saying these words.
My brother and friend thou see well that thobedyence that is in me proceeds
of this good abbot Or / which is so humble and obedyente that I am
constrained to ensyewe and follow his manners and condycyons. After this the
said Sysoy departed much Joyous and conforted And rewled him self upon that
which he had seen in the said two holy faders. Therefore answered ye said
Sysoy to one of the brethern which was with the said Pystus when he asked him
/ brother show to us sign and example of charity toward us / and give to us
some doctrine. My friend who has plenytude of virtues / and pryncypall
humylyte above all other he compryseth all the holy scripture.

An other brother asked and demanded of him what was of very pylgremage. To
whom he answered / that it was to keep him self stylle. And in what someuer
place that he were / to blame nothing / but all to praise / with out to have
any desire of any worldly thing that it were.

An hermyte on a time vysyted the abbot Sysoy in a place named ye montayne of
saint Anthony / to whom the said brother said these words. Fair fader it is a
long time that thou have he here. I suppose and bylere certainly that thou
have not yet ye noble virtues that had the holy fader Anthonye / the which
answered to him. Alas my brother and my friend what say you / if I had one
sparkle of his charity which was in him I should be all in a fire.
Notwithstondynge I wot not ne know man so parfyght that may bear the
penaunces / which made and suffered the good and holy abbot saint Anthonye.
After he asked if in time passed the deuylles tempted the relygyous people as
they did then that aforsayd lived. To whom answered the said Sysoy / that
more strongly the devil tempted in the said time / than he had done in time
passed. For as much as the end of the world approaches / of much enforces
he the more to make the poor souls to fall in to the horrible pains of
hell.

Other brethern went toward the said Sysoy for to receive his doctrine but he
said nothing to them / but my brethern pardonne me / like as he would say. I
am not worthy ne suffysau^t to proferre fro my mouth holy words. And for as
much as they saw in his celle many hostyes / they asked of his dyscyple
Abraham what he did with them. The dyscyple answered that he sent some this
day to one house / and to morrow to an other. The holy fader heryng that / said
to them thus / My brethern. Sysoy eteth here and there not that he be a beggar
here and there in diverse houses / for he makes hottes and paners for to serve
them of that they have to do. Of this humylyte were the brethern conforted and
Ioyously returned to the place from when^ they were comen.

To the said holy fader a brother said these words. I know tayr fader that my
mind is dyrectly set all to god. To whom he answered / that is no great
thing if thy soul be addressed to god by contemplaco^n. But it is a gretter
thing if you see well thy self / in reputyng the by very humylyte the lest of
all creatures / and for to come to that / thou must make lene thy body / and
in that doing thou shall get lightly humylyte / by the which you shall know
thy self.

And to this purpose said the devout relygyous saint Syncletyce / like as it
is Impossyble to make a shypp^ with out diverse point of nails and other
matters. In like wise it is Impossyble to be saved without humylyte.

In like wise the holy abbot Ypericius said. The tree of life is in heaven above
which mounteth the humylyte of a monk / yet furthermore he said that we ought
all ten^yewe the publycan / the which in the temple reputed him self unworthy
to be named and called the servant of god our savior Ihesu christ in cryeng
and askyng mercy And on the contrary we ought teshewe and flee the pharyseen
which gloryfyed him in his virtues / we ought also to ensyewe the clemens and
meekness of Moses / to the end yt ye proud enhau^synges we might convert in
to the sea that is to say in to teres of very contryco^n and penance.

For to give counsel to eschew and resyste to our evil temptaco^ns /
thabbot Orysyus made such a comparyson / like as cyle or break put in to
ashes / if it be not well baken / it shall never make good fou^dement in a
wall / set in a watery place / or other. In like wise a man living in this
world shall never be well edefyed / but if he be well taken by the fire of
diverse temptacyons / and proved by the same / for in temptaco^n is proved our
virtue. Hereof we have example of Joseph sold by his brethern / the which
being in the house of Pharao ydolatrer / suffered and endured many great
aduersytees and tourmentes / and notwithstanding he served god in keeping
dylygently his commandments and his law / how be it that he was in the
country of ydolatrye / in which thydoles were adoured and worshypped. And to
this purpose sayden the holy faders that every person ought to know his
strength and possybylyte. For none ought to entrepryse more strongly than he
can accomplysshe / as some yt will take the burden and charge of relygyon. And
anon as they be entered / and yt the devil has given to them assault they
recu^e and goo back / and renounce that / which they have entreprysed. Of
whom it is said / that they shall not be crowned / for they resyste not unto
the end. An hermyte estemyng himself to be parfyght and vyctoryous in his
temptaco^ns replenysshed with all virtues made a request to god / yt it would
please hy^ to show what perfecco^n other than he had had yt might be to hy^
necessary. Then he herd by reuelaco^n yt by his hermytage was an herdemen /
yt which should counsel hy^ which he had to do / that done the angel went
to the said herdeman and said to him how the said hermyte should come to hy^
for to have counsel of his health. And when he should be come yt he should
deliver to hy^ a fouet and his hogs to keep. All this did the goodness of god
for to humble the said hermyte. It happed that the said hermyte went to the
said herdeman / like as it was showed to him / to whom the herdeman anon asked
him first / if he would do all that he should command him / and he answered
/ ye / then he delivered to him a fouet and his hogs to keep. The said
hermyte following his promysse / did all that the herdeman commanded him / and
kept his hogs a long time. Many said of hy^ that he was become a fooll / or
that he had the devil in his body. God consyderyng his humylyte called him
again in speryte. And he returned in to his hermytage.

An other monk solytary and much humble was smeten in the Iowe by a demonyake
/ that is to say that he was vexed with a devil. The same monk in keeping ye
counsel of Ihesu christ profred to hy^ that other Iowe to the end that he
should smite again. Then the devil which might not abide in the place of
humylyte / because that he is prince of pride / left the man / and sprang out
of his body.

An old fader said that they that be humble which desire to observe their
humylyte / when they be tempted with elaco^ns and ambycyous pride / pryncypally
they that wene to be devout and parfyght in virtues / oughten incontinent to
think on their conscience / and consider if they have well kept the
commandments of god / if they have loved or hated their enemies / if they be
angry of their well and promoco^s / and if they rejoice them of their
trybulaco^ns / and in thynkyng on such things / a very meke person shall
repute him an vnprouffytable servant / and worst of all sinners.

In like wise said an other holy fader yt a man should never repute him self
more sobre / more contynent / ne more wise than an other / but always to Judge
him self subget and simple servant of god having need of his grace / and all
this by very humylyte without fyccyon or ypocresye. And by this one shall keep
from lesyng of the fruit of the labor that he should have gotten by penance /
for as much as one should eschew arrogaunce / or estymacyon of his merytes /
in remyttyng all to god. And this rewle is the pryncypall among people of
deuoco^n. To this purpose said an other holy fader that of so much that the
virtue of a man is more praised / of so much more he ought to humble
himself. Moo persons ben saved yt have not be honored in this world / than
of other that have been constytued in honor and worldly favor.

A brother demanded of an holy fader if it were necessary to be in contynuell
contryco^n and penance. To whom he answered / ye / And thereof he gaaf him an
example of Ihesus sone of Naue / the which being in contemplacyon and deououte
oryson lay upon therthe / god appeared to him / and not when he was out of his
contemplacyons.

An other demanded of an holy fader fro whens it proceeded yt he was so often
trauaylled of deuylles. To whom he answered yt it was because that he had lost
his armours spyrytuell / that is to wit humylyte / pacyence / pouerte / and
suffryng of Iniuryes. For the send takes his adversary more soon when he
fyndeth him without wepen than when he keeps him armed.

An other brother asked in like wise of an holy fader / if a man came to him for
to have comfort or consolacyon in his temptaco^ns / or ask counsel to
resyste his sins / if he ought to refuse it to him / saying yt he should go
without to recou^te to him his vices and sins / or if he ought to say to him
/ that in time to come he should keep hy^ from such operaco^ns. The holy fader
first answered yt he ought not to refuse to here his proposyco^ns. Secondely he
ought not say in rebukyng him yt he should eschew his sins by such manner
and such / to the end yt if in time coming him self fylle in such
temptaco^ns / he were worthy of more great reprobaco^n because he did not ye
which he cou^seylled. But it should be good to be stylle and say naught. For
by scylence he should show good ensample enough to correct him self of the
sins by him co^mysed.

An holy man for to give an answer to an other which asked him what was
humylyte / he said ye humylyte is to forgive and pardo^ne our enemies the
wrongs and Iniuryes which they had done to us / to fore er they ask
forgyuenesse. An other holy fader said yt he had never wylled to change his
^^dre ne desired to be of more strayt ne less / but he had be all his life all
founded in prayer and oryson / unto that it pleased god to call him in to his
Royalme in departing by death the soul out of his body.

An other said yt none ought to blame him that does to him wrong or repreef /
but oonly ought to say yt for his sins god sends him this trybulaco^n. And
therefore said an holy fader / that very humylyte is to do well to them yt do
to us evil. And when one demanded him by what moyen he might come to such
virtue. He answered that in keeping his tongue / and in leuyng the world.

An other good ensample for to show the form of humylyte. A pilgrim walkyng
found on a time in a monasterye a great nombre of relygyous men the which
after the service was done and his oryson acco^plysshed / followed the brethern
of the said monasterye / and set him self at table wenyng to dyne with
them / as he had be of the house a Relygyous man. The brethern much abashed
of ye hardynes of this pilgrim. And because it was not their custom to receive
Relygyous strangers / they hu^ted or chaced him out of their couente. The same
pilgrim mekely went his way without to anger him self ne gaynsayeng. After
the said brethern had remorse of conscience / and were sorry and dyspleasau^t of
yt they had put him out of their company / without to have given to him his
refeccyon / wherefore incontinent they called him again. And when he was comen
again they asked him what thought he had had in his courage / then when they
had driven him out of their covent / and after had called him again. To whom
he answered / that he had none other thought / but yt he had been reputed
semblable to an hand / ye which when he is menaced and thretened he flees
away / and when he is called again / anon he comes again. Gyuyng them to
understand by his words / that in like wise ought to do all they that will
have very humylyte and all to suffer without murmr.

Some brethern of Thebayde ladde a demonyake to an holy fader / to the end yt
by his prayers / he might be delivered of the possessyon of the devil. The
which holy fader as constrained by their requests said to ye devil yt he
should depart out of the body of ye same man. The devil answered. I goo but
first say to me / what men ben they yt in scripture ben reputed ghotes / and
which ben they yt be semblable to lambs. The holy fader knowing yt by the
ghotes ben sygnefyed ye lecherous people / and also by the lambs ye holy
devout persons fulfilled with humylyte. Answered to him yt the ghotes were
such people as he was himself / but the lambs yt is to say ye good / god
oonly knows them. The devil by his answer founded in humylyte / by the
which the holy fader reputed him self to be a great sinner / was constrained
to go out of the body of ye said demonyake / saying yt he might no longer
endure the presence of a man full of so great humylyte.

The holy faders sayden yt we be tempted with pride or vain glory / wherefore
we ought to humble us. For god knowing our fraylte socoureth us incontinent by
grace / but when we take glory / wenyng to resyste it of our self / he
suffers us to fall in diverse manners of wyckednes and trybulaco^ns in speryte
The devil for to deceive an hermyte appeared to him in form of an angel.
And when thermyte saw him / anon he closed his eyes to the end that in no wise
he would see him. Then the devil asked wherefore he opened not his eyes /
seen yt he was sent from god for to comfort him. The said hermyte answered
mekely these words. Thou that say the to be an Angel / take heed to whom
thou spekest. I believe that if thou be an angel of god / thou ought not to
adresse the to me but to an other. The devil seeing his humylyte and
constau^ce Incontinent departed thens. It behooves first to prove the spyrytes
/ that is to wit if they ben of god or not / to fore that you give faith to
their words. And for so much sayden the holy faders that in all apparycyons /
yet when they shall be of god / every person ought to humble him self in
saying. Alas my god I that am a poor sinner am not worthy to be vysyteth of
thine Angel in this corruptyble world.

To this purpose is founden of an aged fader / when the devil appyered to him
making to him diverse assaults / the which he suffered pacyently in dyspysyng
their temptaco^ns. One of the said deuylles seeing himself over comen /
appyered to him in form of our savior saying. Fair fader opene thyn eyes for
I am Ihesu christ. To whom he answered humbly. As touching to me I will not see
Ihesu christ in this world / for I am not worthy / if it pleases him of his
grace. I shall see him in that other world. And with his answer ye devil
vanysshed away A like answer gaaf to the deuylles an other holy fader to whom
they demanded if he would see Ihesu christ in saying to them. Goo ye cursed
deuylles where as it is given you to be. Have I not my god which cou^seylleth
me saying / thou man sinner if any come to the and say / here or there is
Ihesu christ / give there to no consent ne answer to their words / for they
be all Illusyons and decepco^ns.

A brother hermyte for to have reuelaco^n of a doubt that he had of ye holy
scripture fasted.lxx. wekes / and ete not but ones in the weke. After ye said
time seeing ye god had made to him no reuelaco^n he departed fro his chamber /
and purposed to go demand his brother the solucyon of his questyon. God
knowing his humylyte / incontinent sent to him an Angel which said to him.
Brother I notefye to the that the fasting that thou have made / has not
rendered the so much agreeable to god. For to know the dyffyculte that thou
pretendest to know / for by thy merytes / thou wendest to constrayne god to
show it to the. But for as much as thou have humbled thy self / to will
ask of thy fellow. I am sent fro god to notefye to the the same. Then he
declared it to him / and after the angel departed fro him / by the which
example it appyreth that with out humylyte we may not obtain of god any grace
what someuer penance we do.

An other doctrine for of folk astate constytued in dygnyte. The same holy
faders wytnessen that every man having domynacyon and preemynence upon other /
if he command a thing to his subgettes / so that it be by humylyte / and for
thonour of god / in all things she shall be obeyed. But if he command them
by arrogau^ce / as to repute him self worthy to be obeyed / with out to have
regard that it be for the honor of god and without humylyte and dread of god
/ he shall not suffer that such lords be obeyed of their subgettes. And by
this is known when any operaco^ns ben to be done if they be founded in charity
and of good persons or evil. And therefore said an holy fader. I had lever
be ouercomen in mekyng my self / than to vaynquysshe by my pride. And an other
said that never ought one despise his servant with whom he is / for none
knows if he have the spyryte of god / either that we have it that despise him.

An hermyte demanded of an holy fader / if he saw any of his brethern do
evil and sin dedely / if he ought to repreue him. The holy fader answerde to
him / that if in the company were more older than he / he ought to be stylle.
And by that moyen he should have peace. For in as much as he holds him self
less than other / there is less envy / and also he is more sure in his
conscience. The brother replyked again saying / that he might not bear the
detryment of his brother seeing him sin as who should say nature constrained
him to repreue him. The holy fader answered to him / that he might well ones
repreue him and correct him brotherly without more. And if by adventure his
speryte might not be appeased he should return to god by devout oryson
which should comfort him.

Furthermore he said that the very servant of god ought always to leave his
will / and to remytte him self to god in obseruyng contynuelly scylence /
which is very humylyte. And to this purpose demanded an hermyte of an holy
fader / what was the fruit of a man mortal / in which he ought to get
merit and mede. To whom he answered that it was humylyte. For of so much is
he the more enhau^sed in perfeccyon. And therefore an holy fader said / that
when a man asked pardon / and forgyuenes of an other of the evil yt he has
done to him / if he do it by humylyte / the deuylles which have tempted him to
do the evil / incontinent departen from him.

An holy fader for to teache men to eschew vain glory said such a parable as
follows. That is to wit / that he that makes oil / couere not the eyes of
the horse that turned the mylle / he would not goo / but should tarry to do
his work. In like wise also / a man that is penytente / ought not to see his
operaco^ns virtuous / to the end that in consyderyng them he praise himself and
be proud. For fynably he should lose thereby his labor and merit. And for
that cause in certain days the holy faders reduseden to gydre to remembrance
all their foul cogytacyons / to the end that by they^ they made a veyle to
couere the virtuous works that they made. Therefore every man that accuses him
self in very humylyte shall never be dampened if he get the mercy of our
redemer. And thus for to do an holy fader desired more to be taught without
comparyson / than to teache / to the end of him self he should esteem ygnoraunce
and symplenesse. And the same holy fader said / that no man ought to teache ne
preche / but if he have aege / manners / and science. Otherwise he shall be
reputed all his life a fooll and unworthy to be among them that be wise.

A brother demanded of an holy fader / what thing was humylyte. To whom he
answered that it was a yefte of god / the which is had in dooyng penance
bodily / in reputyng himself a sinner / and to yield him self subgette to all
them with whom he conuerseth Then he demands and asked him what it was to
say to be subgette to men. And he answered / that it was to take heed to his
sins / and not to know the sins of his neighbor / and to pray
co^tynuelly that god give mercy to sinners.

An other required an holy fader that he would say to him one word how he
might be saved. He answered to hy^ that if he might endure all wrongs that
were done to him it is a virtue above all other / by ye which he might get
his health. And for this cause an holy fader defended his dyscyple that he
should not frequente people constytued in dygnytees / for often in following
them one desires to be a lord as they be.

A brother being in a covent / the which in all vices and sins he said hy^
self to be a sinner. And that also that he made not so many mattes ne hand
works as made his brethern / wherefore they began to murmr against hy^ the
which thing knowing the abbot / and also the virtues of the brother / he said
to all the Relygyouses. Childern know ye that I love better one oonly matte
with the humylyte of your brother upon who^ ye murmr / than all yours made in
pride which ouercometh you A brother asked of an holy fader / how that it was
possible that a man durst presume in him self to have so much deserved
toward god to say that he had seen angellys face to face. The holy fader
answered to him / that he is well happy yt sees well his sins. As who would
say / that for to see the angellys of god is not possible.

A relygyous brother knowing that one his brother was angry against him desyryng
to appease him / went to hy^ and knockyng at his cellle door / but he would
not opene hit. Then he that would have appeased him / went to an holy fader
/ and told to him the caas in chargyng his brother of that he would not opene
his door / the which answered to him. Brother keep the that thou Iustefye not
thy self in blamyng thy brother / for that is nothing the way of humylyte.
And by cause thou have not proceeded by that way god has not suffered that thy
felawe has not opened his door. Nevertheless thou must consydere if he have
sinned against the by wrath / that in like wise other time thou haste sinned.
And therefore Iustefye thy brother / and accuse thy self / if thou so do /
god shall give courage to accord him self with the. And for to better to
comfort hy^ ye holy fader recounted to him this ensample following. Two seculer
men of honest life conuersyng to gydre by common assent entreden in to Relygyon
And wenyng to do a work of great merit ghelded them self / and made them
quyte of their genytours. This consyderyng the Archebysshop cursed them. When
they knew it being moeued of great courage / murmured against the said
Archebysshop / in saying that for the more lyghtelyer to absteyne them from
sin / they had done it. And so by that moyen to come to the kingdom of
heaven. As men being out of Reason they went to complain to the Archebysshop
of Iherusalem. And to him they recou^ted all their caas like as it was happed /
the which in like wise cursed them. Wherefore more angry than to fore / they
went in like wise to the Archebysshop of Anthyochye supposyng to have obtained
some socour. But as the other he cast the sentence upon them. Fynably they
concluded to goo to Rome. And after that they were arrived / they recounted to
the pope all the sentences that had be cast upon them / and for that cause
they were come to him as sovereign and head of all holy church for to have
their absolucyon. The pope herd their request cursed them and pryued them
by his sentence of all the prayers of the holy church / whereof they were more
melancolyous than to fore / and murmured against him and all the other prelates
/ with whom they had be saying that they were acceptours of persons / and
not without cause they made congregacyons for to conclude after their appetyte
the matters that might come before them. Thus they wist not what to do / but
to goo to an holy man bishop of Cypre named Epyphanius / which had the
yefte of prophecye. And as they aoproched toward the cite where as the said
bishop was / he knew by reuelacyon of their coming and the cause wherefore
they came. And he sent to them chargyng that they should not be so hardy to
enter within his cite. When they herd these tidings / they thought in them
self / that their coming had be showed to the said holy bishop / and that
they had great wrong wenyng to Iustefye they^ self in blamyng the bysshyp
that first had excomyned and cursed them Then they reputed them self
worthy of great punysshement saying that meruayllously they had offended their
maker / god knowing their contrycyon and humylyte made reuelacyon to the said
Epyphanius that they were dysposed to do penance. Then he sent to seche
them / and received they^ goodly in to his house. And after that he had
assoylled them by the pope / and were restored to the holy sacraments of ye
church. He wrote to the bishop of Alexandrye for they^ in this manner. Fader
receive these two childern / for in troth they have done penance for the
sin that they have co^mysed as much against god and his law as against the.
The holy fader / after that he had recounted this hystorye said to the
foresaid Relygyous brother My sone thus it behooves the to do if you will get
thy health. For god will that a man after that he has sinned / Incontinent
return to him by penance. When the said brother had herd all this that the
holy fader had told to him / he returned and concluded to do in like wise as
he had said and knocked at door of his felawe / the which anon opened it to
him / and enbraced each other by amyable peace and concord which they had to
gydre.

Two monks brethern germayne lyueden to gydre in charity and union a long
time / the which the devil enemy of peace supposed to have departed them to
the end that they should no more dwell to gydre. So it happed on an euentyde /
that the younger lyghted a candell / and set it upon the candelstycke / and
after he began to do his work. The devil anon ouerthrewe the said candel.
That seeing that other / the which was older / and wenynge that it had be
defaulte of his brother / beat him strongly in great anger and meouyng of
courage. The young brother cried softly. Alas my brother I pray you forgive it
me / and I shall goo light it again. The devil saw that the younger brother
was not angry / but pacyente and in great humylyte had endured the correccyon
of his brother / As wood and tourmented by the power of god went and recounted
this to the prince of deuylles / how a young monk by his humylyte had put
him out of the hermytage. The priest of the ydoles heryng that / forsook
Incontinent his ydolatrye / and yielded himself to be Relygyous. And after his
conuersacyon was so happy to keep humylyte / saying that humylyte chaceth the
power of the deuylles / in like wise as they had herd witness in spekyng
that one to that other. Furthermore said the same priest that to fore his
co^uersyon / he had herd the deuylles complaynyng them to gydre saying / that
when a monk was fall in dedely sin / anon some of them did penance for
him / wherefore all their power was naught / in such wise that they might not
gryeue ne ennoye the said Relygyous persons.

Here begins the virtue of pacyence.


FOr to learn and know how we might have the virtue of pacyence. Every person
that will read this present treatise / note in his heart / and also reteyne
thexamples and dyctes of holy faders here after declared. The which ben of
much value and prouffyte. For they moeuen to devotion / and also to have
strength and pacyence against aduersyte.

On a time for certain cause was made a congregaco^n of many relygyouses /
among whom was an holy fader called Euagrius / the which proposed among the
brethern his opinion of the matter whereof was ye questyon. To whom the souerayn
abbot of the said congregaco^n said. Fader abbot we know well / yt if you were
in thy contree you sholdest be a bishop or chyef of many relygyouses. And now
as a pilgrim and stranger you syttest with us. The good devout man Euagrius
without to moeue him self / but in speryte / answered not one word / but
wrote in the earth. Brethern it is so as ye say.

The abbot Johan the little being on a time set to fore the gate of his
church / many brethern satte with him And of diverse thought and scrupulous
cogytaco^ns they asked him / to whom by the help of god he gaaf so good
answer / that they all were comforted. That seeing an old fader moeued of
enuyee said these words. Fader Johan thy vyole is full of venym. To whom he
answerde / my fader you sayste truth / but if you saw that which is in my
heart. I wot never what you sholdest say / when you see not but that which
appears without forth. And thus to the Iniurye that was said to him / he
answered pacyently.

Of the great pacyence of the abbot Ysydore dwelling in Sychye wytnessen the
holy faders / that when an old fader had a dyscyple frail or Iniuryous and he
would put him away. The same Ysydore prayed that he would give him to him /
for all them he should make virtuous by his pacyence.

Of less pacyence was not the holy fader Macharye / the which when he found
a thief in his celle / which charged or laded upon his horse or other best all
his goods / he would help the thief to lade his horse / as if he had be his
felawe. And in so dooyng he said such words as follow. When we came in to
this world we had no thing. God gives all. And as he will so be it done /
and praised be he in all things / ben they contrary or prouffytable.

In like wise the abbot Moses with many other was in a congregaco^n made in
Sychye / in the which some brethern for to preue his pacyence / said to hy^
these words. Come hither thou Ethyopyen as black as thou art who has made
the so hardy to presume to come with us. To the which words he answered not.
After they asked him / they that had so Iniuryed him / if he was any thing
wroth. To whom he said that he had be troubled in his heart / but that not
withsta^dyng he absteyned him to speak / for pacyentely he had endured.

Paysius brother of the holy fader Pastor / had famylyaryte with some
brethern / whereof ye said Pastor was evil content. And for to correct him he
went to make of him complain to thabbot Ammonas in saying to him / yt he might
no more endure such things. Thabbot Ammonas answered to him to give him matter
of pacyence / ha Pastor thou have yet good live and strong. Go go in thy celle
/ and consydere that you have an hot head and an high courage / how well that
you art nyghe the point for to be leyde in thy grave or to^be. And by that
concluded the said Pastor / that all labor and aduersyte which comes to us
is light to bear / so that we have scylence and peace in our heart without
grutchyng.

There was an hermyte a brother which was hurt of an other / and for to be
avenged he complained to the abbot Sysoy / saying that if he would not do right
to him and reason / that he himself would avenge it. The holy man Sysoy prayed
him affectuously / that he should do nothing to him yt had hurt him ne to do
to hy^ any dysplesyr / but to leave to god the vengeance. The brother fulle of
malygnyte abode in his evil will protestyng always to avenge him. Thabbot
seeing his obstynaco^n / prayed him that first he should make his oryson and
prayer to god / and after accomplysshe his will / of yt which request the said
brother was content / and so put them both to pray unto our lord togydre. This
done the abbot Sysoy said god is not much necessary to evil people / for he
will venge him of their wrongs done by them. The hermyte heryng yt changed
his will and fill down to the abbot Sysoy in promysyng that he would do no
dyspleasyr to him that had hurt him. An other brother seeing his felawe beryng
a deed man to the earth / prayed him that he would here with him the living /
that is to say / that he shode endure that / which the living men shlode say
to him or do / and in so doing he should bear them. And to this purpose is
fou^den of a brother / the which often frequented and honored all them that
did to him repreef and wrongs / and by that he refrayned there Ire. In like
wise it happeth oftymes that they / the which correct them by wrongs /
geten good manners / by the moyen of such wrongs. For it is written / they that
bless and praise you / begyle your souls.

Certain thieves on a time entered in to the celle of an holy aeged fader / and
said to him. Fader we will have all that is here within. To whom he answered /
that they should bear away all that which seemed to them good. And so they
bare away all that was in his celle / sauf a little sack / which lay in a
corner. And when the holy fader found it he ran after them and bare to
them the said sack saying. My childern ye have forgoten this sack / take it
with you to the end that ye have all. The thieves meruaylled them of his great
pacyence / and rendered all to him again / and were after all their life
penytent saying each to other / verayly this holy fader is the servant of god
full of the virtue of pacyence.

The holy faders wytnessen that an hermyte had with him a young dyscyple
replenysshed with all evil will. On a time among other the holy man repreued
him of his sin in saying to him. My sone do not that. That not withstondyng
the same dyscyple amended not him self / wherefore thermyte seeing yt he was
pertynax and obstynate he corrected him no more / but concluded in him self /
to suffer him to do what him good seemed. After yt yet he did worse / for he
shytte and closed the celle of the said hermyte. In the which was no more but
three loves oonly / and suffered him fast three days / during the which time /
the said hermyte said no thing ne did to him. This knowing an other hermyte
his next neyghebour made potage for him and delivered it to him by an hole of
the wall of his celle / and asked him wherefore his dyscyple was so long or he
came / he answered without any anger / that when it pleased him he should come
again.

Many phylosophres being togydre in a place / passed by them a Relygyous well
and honestly clothed after his astate. The phylosophres desyryng to preue the
pacyence of the relygyous man called him in saying to him. Ha monk come and
speak to us / and so he did. After this passed an other great monk and of
low condyco^n / to whom the phylosophres sayden. Ha monk folysshe and evil
come and speak with us / incontinent he went to them And anon as he was comen
/ one gave a buffet to him on the cheke. After which buffet by him received
which was armed with pacyence / presented to them that other cheke after ye
counsel of Ihesu christ / when they knew his pacyence / they praised him /
and made him to sytte in the mids of them / saying / verily this is a very
monk. After they demanded how much more penance do ye in deserte than they
that be in the world. For they said / if ye fast / so do we / if ye
chastyse your body / so do we / then what do ye more than we. The monk
answered / we live in hope / and we keep scylence and our thought fro thynkyng
evil. The phylophres herynge this last answer / praised they^ saying that it
was an hard thing that to do to them that been in ye world / for they them
self could not do it.

An holy fader had a dycyple of great pacyence / the which on a time / by
cause that he was angry put him anon out of his house. The good dyscyple was
not proud / but yielded him humbly and pacyente went not from the door of his
fair fader / to fore the which when the fader opened his door / the dyscyple
anon fylle down on his knees / in asking him forgyuenes The holy fader
gretely admeruaylled of his pacyence said to him. Ha my sone from hens forth
thou shall be my fader / for by thine humylyte and pacyence / thou have
overcome my pusyllanymyte. Enter and goo in my sone / thou shall be holden and
reputed my fader. And I that am old shall be thy young dyscyple / that is to
say / that I am younger than thou in virtues. For by thy great pacyence
constauntly suffered / thou have put down my feeble age. And to this purpose
recounten some holy faders / that many young Relygyous men nowrysshed them
that been old because of their evil governance. And pryncypally we find of
an old hermyte which made not in a day and night but one matte / the which
he sold anon and drank the money which he had received. So it happed
that a young brother with him lodged / which also every day made a matte /
the which in like wise the same old man sold with the his / and enployed in
win all the money that he had received for them and after drank it without
to bring any thereof to his dyscyple sauf oonly a little bread which he
brought to him at even. This life ladde the old fader by the space of three
year / without any grutchyng of the young man or any evil word. After
consyderyng that he was naked and he ete not but bread not half enough /
purposed him to depart and to goo in to an other hermytage / but on that other
side he considered that he ought to endure it for the love of god. And that he
was not hermyte for any other thing but for to do penance / wherefore he
concluded that he would not depart out of his hermytage. And anon an Angel
appyered to him saying. Brother depart not / for to morn we shall come to the.
Of this apparycyon was much Joyous the young dyscyple. And after he prayde his
old fader thermyte that on the morn he would not goo out of his celle in to
the town as he was accustomed to goo every day / and that his friends should
come seche him. The hour comen that the said hermyte was accustomed to goo for
to selle his mattes / he said to his dyscyple. My sone I will goo to selle our
mattes. For they for whom thou abydest seen that it is now late / will not
come this day. The dyscyple answered. My fader know for truth that they
shall come. And in saying those words he rendered and yielded up his speryte.
Then the old fader began to cry / helas helas / a long time it is that I
have lived in this deserte in great neclygence of my health / and thou virtuous
child by the pacyence that thou have had of me in a little time have taken by
assault the Royame of heaven. And fro then forthon the old hermyte becam
much sobre / and lived more holyly than he had be accustomed.

Great pacyence and meruayllous suffered a common woman and was named Thays / the
which was of so great beauty garnysshed / that for her pleasant maynteyne
and swear regard many young fresshe and lecherous persons sold their rentes
and revenues for to entreteyne and accompanye the said Thays. And in the end
they came to shameful pouerte and mendycyte. And that worse / detestable and
more dangerous thing was / by cause that many pretended to enjoy her
eueryche at his own will. Oftentimes her door was blody with the blood of the
young men yt in great nombre faught for her An holy fader abbot named Paphunce
aduertysed of her poor and miserable life / and desyryng to withdraw the said
Thays from her evil life / cladde hy^ self in seculer habyte / and took
money for to go to the house of ye said Thays dwelling then in a cite of
Egypt The holy saint fond her in her house And after that he had salewed her /
he presented and offered to her a shelyng for her reward of ye sin which he
feigned to co^myse with her. Thays which took of all hondes received ye shelyng
/ and made ye good man to enter in to her chamber / where as was a bed
richely arrayed / and covered with a precious covering upon which she lay /
byddyng him to come and to do his lecherye. But he yt desired other thing than
to co^myse yt dyshonest sin / by a manner of dread / prayed her yt if there
were a place more secret within there yt she would led hy^ thither / to the end
yt none should see them. To the which she answered in this wise that her
chamber was secret enough / and yt there should no person see them there. But
she said yt there is no place so secret in the world that any thing can be
hid from god / which knows and sees all things. The holy fader heryng
this answer said to her / my friend know thou well that there is a god / ye
said she. And I believe the resurreccyon general / and after the same we shall
have the royame of heaven / if we do the works required for to come thither.
And ferther more I believe that there is hell / in which shall be tourmented
the miserable dampened persons for the perpetuell vengeance of their sins.
The holy fader Paphunce heryng these words said to her. Now my friend I ask
the sith thou know these things / how thou art so hardy to live so
meschau^tly / and to be cause of the perdycyon and loss of so many miserable
souls / which ben by thoccasyon of the so yrremyssybly lost and dampened /
and of whom thou must relde acompte to fore god. Thays heryng the holy fader /
and his meruayllous remonstraunces was at ye hour touched to the heart / that
she fill down on her knees to fore him saying. Fader I hope that by great
penance and mean of thy holy prayers I shall mow obtain remyssyon of my
great and foul stynkyng sins. And therefore I require the that it please the
to give me the space of three hours. And them passed I shall accomplysshe all
that which thou wylt command me / the which request the holy Paphunce
accorded to her. And assygned to her a place to the which she promised to come
and yield her to him. And incontinent ye done / she took all the goods that
she had gotten by her lecherye / and bare them in to the mids of the cite /
and there she threw them in to a great fire / which she had kyndled for to
brenne. And in so doing she said. Come hither ye dyshonest lecherous people
which so much shamefully have sinned with me / and see how I dyspose that
which ye have given to me. And saying the said words she burnt all
generally that she had of any valewe / which well amounted after that the
hystorye conteyneth to forty pound of gold. That done she went to the place
to her assygned by the said fader / which tarried there for her. And fro thens
he led her in to a monastery of virgyns where as she was by him closed in a
celle little and strayte / of the which he closed the door / as he should
never have opened it / and made a little wyndowe a low by ye ground by which
she might receive a little bread and water / without any other thing to ete or
drink. And with that she had none withdraught / where as she might do her
aysement / but under her. When she was shette and closed in / she required
humbly the holy fader Paphunce / that he would Instruct and teache her the
manner after yt which she should pray unto god. To the which he answered that
she was not worthy to adoure hy^ ne to left up her vysage ne her hands
toward heaven / which had be cause of co^mysynge so many fylthes and
corrupcyons. And yet said the holy fader. Thays thy prayer shall be made in
this manner / thou being laid on the earth toward the eest shall say many
times. My god which haste formed me have pity on me. This good woman Thays
did this penance three year during / the which three year passed / the holy
fader Paphunce had mercy and pity of her / but yet nevertheless he would not
let her out / without to have counseyll of the abbot Anthonye / the which
after that the said Paphunce had recounted the great penance that she had
done / made to be assembled and put to prayer all his dyscyples for to know
if her sin were forgive and pardonned / hopyng that god should show or do
be showed some thing. They being in devout and fervent prayers / one of them
named Paulus which was of the pryncypall dyscyples of saint Anthonye was
suddenly rauysshed / and him thought that he saw in heaven a bed ^orned right
precyously / and kept with four virgyns meruayllously fair. Then he said to
him self / that this fair bed was prepared for his master Saint Anthonye
and for none other. And he being in this ymagynacyon / herd a voys saying to
him that it was for Thays which in her time had be a common woman. On the
morn erly the said Paulus recou^ted to his brethern the said vysyon / the
which herd by the said fader Paphunce / he knew that the said Thays had
obtained pardon and remyssyon of her sins. And then departed from thens and
went unto the monasterye / where in she was enclosed. And when the good Thays
saw that her door was opened / she began to cry that they should let her
abide there unto her last day. But Paphunce would not agree unto her
petycyon. And said to her that she should come forth / and that her sins were
pardonned and forgyuen. After that she was out / for to declare how she had
done her penance. She said to the said abbot / that all the time that she
had be closed and shette in / there was not one mynute / but that she had
considered all her sins which she had co^mysed in weeping and wayllyng
habondauntly. Then thabbot said to her. For the dread that thou have had of
thy sins / god has forgyuen the / and not for thy penance. Fyften days
after / that she issued out of her celle / she rendered and gaaf up her soul to
almighty god as the hystorye conteyneth.

Here begins an other hystorye of Contemplacyon.


FOr as much as it is notoyre and known / that among other virtuous works.
Contemplacyon is right excellent as that which incontinent adresseth to god.
Therefore in this present treatise by the grace of the holy ghoost we shall
determyne of contemplacyon / in procedyng forthon by examples / like as we have
done to fore. Then in the first party of this first chapter / is showed the
great excellence of contemplacyon by one example as it follows.

An holy man came in Sychye to the abbot Arsenye being in his celle / and when
he was come he found his door shette / and he began to behold by the wyndowe
/ and saw the holy abbot which was all in a fla^me withoutforth. and after he
knocked at the door. And anon the holy fader sprange up / demaundyng him if
he had be long there at his door / and if he had seen any thing. The brother
answered that nay and so they spacke to gydre / and after departed.
Thexposyco^n of this ensample will say / that they that be contemplatyfe ben
all brennyng of charity which makes them to bre^ne spyrytuelly.

Thabbot Arsenye said / that one of the holy faders of Sychye / because that he
was simple fill in error / how well that he had lived and Justly after his
power. And the said poor man said yt in ye sacrament of the altar was not
contained the very body of Ihesu criste but oonly the likeness and
representaco^n of him. And this error came to ye knoweleche of two other old
men / the which knowing yt he lived right holyly. And that he said this folly
by symplenesse / camen to him and sayden in this manner. Fader we have herd
say of an Infydele and untrue christian man / that the very body of Ihesu
Christ is not contained in the sacrament of ye altar / but oonly there is his
likeness and semblau^ce. To whom the said fader answered / it is I that have
so said. Then one of them replied to him saying / helas fader believe not
so. But believe that which the holy church byleueth and as we believe. For in
the sacrament of the altar is the very body and blood of our savior Ihesu
Christ / and not oonly his semblaunce or likeness. Then answered the fader.
I believe not that but I see it by experyence. Then they said to him. Now
then fader sith that thou wylt believe thus / it behooves the to pray to god.
And also we shall pray / that he will take fro the this error. And I believe
that he shall show some thing. These words so said this foresaid fader went
much Ioyously in to his celle / and bygan to pray to god in this manner / lord
god almighty which know that mine opinion is not malycyous I pray the that
it may plese the / to show to me she troth. And in like wise the two other
aeged men prayed in saying. Lord god you know that this holy man lives
Justly and straytly / wherefore we beseech the / that you wylt declare to him /
yt which he knows not / touching the sacrament of the altar / to the end
that he lose not the reward of his labor which is so great. And the weke
following they came to the church all three. And in syngyng the mass / there
appeared to them a little child in the stead of the host ye upon the altar /
which the priest held. And when the priest would deuyde the hostye / came an
angel that held a knyf / and sacrefyed the same child to god the fader / and
received the blood within the chalyce. And when ye priest had broken the hostye
in to small pyeces. After that the holy man came for to receive the body of our
lord / and as the priest should delyuere to him ye hostye / it seemed to him
that it was a pyece of flesh full of blood. Then he began to cry. I believe
fermely as this hour that thy very body is in this sacrame^te / and thy very
blood. And anon the hostye came again in his first figure and then he
received it devoutly. And after the holy faders said to him. Fair fader our
lord knowing that nature humayne has horror to ete man's flesh / has not
wylled that his body should appear to men in such lykenes but that it should
be hid under the lykenes of the whytenesse of bread and the redenes of wine.
These things thus said they gaaf laud and thankynges to god / of that it
pleased him to bring this man out of his error. And so they went in to
their celles Ioyously. Here ought to be noted that it is peril to simple folk
to speak or dyspute of such matters / which apperteyneth not but to wise men
and lettred. Therefore when wit fails / oonly faith suffyseth. Then it
behooves to believe / as the church byleueth / without to inquire any ferther.

Thabbot Danyell said that an holy man much ryghtfull that dwelled in Egypt
fylle in an error / in saying that Melchysedech was the sone of god the which
thing heryng Cyryllus archebysshop of alexandrye sent to him. Fader I have
conceived in my thought that Melchysedech was ye sone of god but after I have
byleued contrary. I pray the then that you wylt pray to god for me / and
send to me that I may know the truth. Then the holy man prayed god / and
at the end of three days he send word to the bishop / that Melchysedech was a
man mortal / and not the sone of god / saying that he has had very knowleche
/ by that which god had showed him by an other all the patryarkes that have been sith Adam unto ye said Melchysedech And that the same angel among the
other had showed ye said Melchysedech in namyng him by his name / wherefore he
was certain that he had been a man mortal / and also that he was not the sone
of god. And by this moyen he was out of ye error / in which he had been in to
fore.

A young child named Effrem saw in his sleep a vine with so great habu^dau^ce
charge and replenysshed with fruit that all ye birds of heaven eten thereof /
wenyng to mynysshe the fruit / but the more they ete / the more came again.
That is to say that in time to come he shall teache all the earth in good and
virtuous operaco^ns by prechyng and holsom doctrine.

An other good holy man saw in his sleep a legyon of angellys / descendyng
from heaven which brought a book written within and without / the which might
not be opened as they said / but by the child Effrem. And him seemed that they
delivered to him the book before said / and he opened it. On the morn Effrem
began to teache all the world by predycaco^n. And by this vysyon the holy man
knew that it was by the virtue of the holy ghoost.

An holy fader named Johan saw three monks upon the ryuage of ye see / to whom
was said. Take wings and flee in to that party. And anon the two flewhe
without pain / but ye third uneath might flee / but he wette him self often.
Right so is it in this world. For some flee without pain and lightly. And
there ben rich men and mighty which flee by vain glory among the worldely
people having therein all their desires and pleasaunces. Other flewh in
trybulaco^ns and pains and they were wete often by the water of h^^ynes. Always
in the end they passed the sea of the world and tam to port sa^lewe / that is
in heaven.

Thabbot Macharye of the regyon of Sychye said / when ye shall see the celle of
a relygyous set in a place full of ghotes / know ye then yt Sychye shall
be nygh his end. And when ye shall see it nygh unto the trees / it shall be at
beginning. But if ye see the childern to fore the celle / flee ye thens / and
take your vestymentes.

The abbot Moses said to his brethern / if we keep the commandments of god.
I promise you yt our enemies shall not assaylle us / but if we despise his
commandments / know ye for certain that god shall suffer yt our enemies
shall destroy our habytaco^n and dwelling. And this is consonau^t to the common
saying / if god be with us / who is he that may grieve us / as who says they
that keep the commandments of god / ben by him kept and preserved fro evil.

Thabbot Moses being in his celle said to his brethern / my friends this day
our enemies the Barbaryns shall come hither for to put us to death / and therefore
flee we for to eschew the death Then the brethern sayden to him. And you holy
fader shall you not flee. To whom he answered nay saying that he had long time
abyden that day / to the end that the word of god were accomplysshed. That is
to wit / that all they that smite with sword / with the sword shall deye.
Then ye brethern sayden to him / sith that you wylt abide we will abide / and
deye with the. To whom ye holy man replied in this wise. I have no cause ne
occasyon to goo away / but each of you see how constau^t he is for to endure
the death. And thus as he spacke the enemies came and slew them all / except
oonly one / which was not constau^t ne steadfast in the faith. But for fere
that he had he hid him under a matte of Ionkes. And he being there saw the
angel of god bryngyng seven crowns / of which he crowned thabbot first / and
after each of the six brethern / and thus were they veraye martres.

Mark the dyscyple of Syluanus said to his master wyllyng to goo in to Syrye.
Fader if it please the / abide three days to the end that I conucye the And so
carried the holy man unto the third day / and that day comen / his clerk
deyed.

Thabbot Johan which had be ba^nysshed of one named Marcyen / came on a time to
thabbot Pastor for to ask of the hardenes of a man's heart / whom seeing
Pastor began to speak and said to him / the nature of the water is to be loft
and sweet / and the nature of the stone is to be hard and of great resystence
/ yet always is it seen yt the dropes of water that falls upon the stone /
fynably at last it perceth it / not of the vyolence caused of the water /
but by the contynuell droppyng of ye said water upon the same stone. And so it
is said he of the word of god. For it is sweet and lofte. And our heart is
hard and obstynate. Not for as much / if one hereth it often in fervent
deuoco^n / it makes in our heart which is hard as a stone an hole of the
dread of god. It is written by the psalmyst. That like as the heart desires to
ye fontayne of clear water and clean when he is much weary / all in like wise
our soul coueyteth and desires to come to god / which is the water of life
by grace.

A brother demanded of thabbot Pastor / what ye scripture sygnefyeth sayng
that a man should not do evil for evil To whom the holy man answers / that
may be do in four manners. First in thought. Secondely in beholdynge. Thyrdely
in word. Fourthly in operaco^n ontward and in deed. Thus then if thou think
not evil to an other / behold him not dyspytously / and if you behold him not
by Ire ne by despyte / you shall not speak evil of him. And if ye speak not
evil of him / you shall do no outward work ne thing that not gryeue ne
ennoye him. Thus it is said at beginning / that one ought to resyste and put
remedy to the pryncyples or beginning. And this is consonau^t to the word of
god where he says / love ye your enemies / and do ye good to them that hate
you / and also do ye none evil for evil / but good fyr evil. An holy man
named Basyle said yt in a monastery of wy^men / was a vugyne that feigned her
self demonyake and out of her mind / in so much that all the other fled /
and would not ete ne felashyp with her. And this woman would so live because
she would be in the kechyne / and do all that there was necessary for the other
systres / and all that which was to do in the monastery concerning the
household. And she did all this for to have the more pain and labor
Consyderyng that which out lord says in holy scripture / if any of you says
he / repute him self wise in this world. It behooves him first to correct
him self / and repute him self a fooll to fore that he be wise. And in an
other place is said yt the wysedom of this world / is but folly toward god And
this virgyne was all bare head serving all the other systres in their affairs
/ and with great pain might any see her ete / she satte never at table / and
drank of the wasshyng of pottes where in the wine had be / and she did never
wrong ne dyspleasyr to any other for any thing / she never grutched ne spacke
to person / and oftymes because she spacke not / she was beten and Iniuryed of
the other systres / but she endured and suffered all for the love and honor of
god And because she would not suffer the good to be oppressyd of the evil. God
showed to a good holy man whose name was Pyterius the life of this holy woman /
so herd this holy man a voys saying to him. Pyterius which reputest thy self
a much holy man / if you wylt see a woman more Just than you / go in to ye
monastery of Tabenesyens where as be many holy relygyous wy^men / and her whom
you shall see crowned on the head / know you that she is better than you. For in
fyghtyng every day against a great people / her heart departs not fro my love
/ but you that dwelleste all alone / sometime you have not the virtue for to
resyste the temptaco^ns. The holy fader herd this reuelaco^n / departed
incontinent / and came in to that monastery / and prayed his brethern / which
had the charge of the relygyous wymmen / that they would suffer him to enter in
to the monasterye with them. The brethern seeing ye said fader holy and good
life and also strongly aged made him to enter in without any suspecco^n. And in
beholding the Relygyous wy^men / saw none that had a crown on her head.
Then he said to them me seems that there lacks here one systre of you.
They said to him that there was yet one all folysshe and kept the kechyne /
saying furthermore / that she sometime was tormented with the fend which
grieved her sore. This words so said / the holy fader prayed that he might see
her. Then anon they went to fette her / but she would not come / unto the
time that it was said to her that the holy man Pyterius was there within which
had great desire to see her. And incontinent as she herd him named she went
to him / for he was gretely reno^med in that regyon She being comen to fore the
holy abbot Pyterius / he fill flat down to her feet saying. My friend I pray
the give to me thy blessyng / she in like wise fylle down to the feet of the
holy abbot asking also his blessyng. The other systres seeing this thing were
gretely admeruaylled / and sayden to him. Alas holy fader desire not to ask ye
blessing of this woman / for she is folysshe and out of her wit. Then
answered ye holy fader / ye ben all foles / and this virgyne is wise and she is
my No^ne and yours and he named her so / because they named in like wise the
devout virgynes in ye regyon. And I pray to god said the holy fader / yt at
the day of Judgment that I may be also worthy and capable of the felycyte
everlasting as she / the which thing herd / all the other systres fylle
down to her fete / and confessyd that they had sinned in diverse manners unto
her. Some for they had thrown the wasshyng of ye dysshes upon her / other
oftymes and without cause had beten her / and other in mockyng her had filled
her nose with mustarde. And generally all the other confessyd that they had
done to her meruayllous Iniuryes whereof they all demanded of her pardo^ne and
forgyuenes. And then the holy man departed. And from then forthon the
systres had in great reverence the said holy virgyne meruayllously. But a
little time after / because that she might not endure ye loving and praysyng of
the world / she went secretly out of the monasterye / and never after herd
they any thing of her.

Here after followed the second chapter of contemplacyon.


A Young brother named Zacharye went to his abbot named Syluanus for to speak to
hyym / but he found him Incontemplacyon having his hondes lift up to heaven.
And he seeing that he shette the door / and went his way. After he came again
at the hour of sexte / and at the hour of none. And fynably he came at ten of
the clock at night / and knocked at door and entered in / and he found him
that he rested. Nevertheless he asked of him saying. Helas fader what haste you
had this day / when I was comen hither to the The which answered that he was
seek. Then the brother fylle down ate his feet and said to him. Fader if thou
say not to me what you have had. I shall not leave the to goo. Then said the
holy man. I have be rauysshed to heaven and have seen the glory of god / and
have be deteyned there unto this hour. Some of the old faders sayden that as
they spoke of the holy scryptures and words edyfycatyf / they saw thangels
enjoy and praise god. And after yt they began to speak of worldely things and
vnprouffytable / they saw foull hogs and swyne stynkyng come in ye mids
among they^ which made them all foul. After when they began to speak again
of god / they saw again the angels semblably as they did to fore. That is
to say that god is with them that speak of god / and the devil with them
that speken of dyshoneste things.

An holy man said ye one may sin in four manners. First in evil thought
Secondely in consenting to the same thought. Thyrdely in speaking evil of an
other. Fourthly in doing by work outward that which he had in his evil
thought. And in all these things is not the wrath taken away / but as he says
at the beginning. I shall not punysshe sometime for the three sins / which ben
thought / spekyng / and consentyng / but the fourth / that is to say / when
with them the work shall be done I shall punysshe them.

An holy man of Sychye in making his celle / he was on a time merry and Joyous.
And when ye fou^dement was made / he cessed not till the resydue was achyeued.
It happed on a time that in repayryng he began to weep. The brethern asked him
why he wept. And he answered them / yt he had a great cause of heaviness / for
it had be showed to him / that yt place should be desolate and destroyed. And
said also. I have seen ye fire ones in Sychye / the which has be quenched /
and I saw it also the second time / and it was also quenched / but ye third
time I have seen a meruayllous and so great a fire yt has burnt all Sychye
and might not be quenched / and therefore I have cause to be sorowfulll. An holy
man said it is written in ye psalmyst. The Just shall flourysshe / as the palm
of the foreste of Lybane. And by this it is showed that the good works shall
have for their salayre sweet fruit / ryghtfull / and noble / for in ye palm is
a part sweet and white / and like wise is in the heart of ye rightful man for
he is sweet by mercy and pity / and white by Illumynaco^n of faith. And he is
strong to resyste against the temptaco^n of the fend of hell. The good
sunamyte received Helyzee the prophet in to her house / not yt she had any
carnell affecco^n toward him / for she was holy and Just / but she received
him as a gheste. Morally by this sunamyte is sygnefyed the soul / and by
Helyzee ye holy ghoost. Thus then as oftymes as our soul is withdrawn and
separate from worldely things and seculer in adressyng it to god / so often ye
holy ghoost comes anon for to lodge him in the soul / and then the soul
which tofore was bareyn of good works may bring forth good and holy works.

An other holy man said yt in like wise as we see a swyne which is all foul
and may not lift his eyes toward heaven but always looked dounwarde / so in
like wise is ye soul of a lecherous man / yt which deteyned by his right
foul desire and couetyse may not think but on erthly things / ne lift up ye
eye of co^templaco^n for to know in what astate he is / but he has his taste
so enfecte yt he may not savor any thing that is dyuyne or godly.

A man of much holy life said yt he that rendered himself relygyous by good
deuoco^n / in taking thabyte of professyon received as much grace as does he
yt is baptized / and how be it ye at bapteme is given plenytude of grace / in
likewise he says yt in professyon of holy relygyon is given plenytude of
grace. God gaaf on a time to an holy old man ye power to see all yt ye other
did and made / and so he saw on a time a brother which was in medytaco^n and
thought on god / and ye devil being without / which might not enter during ye
medytaco^n / but anon as he cessed to think on god / ye devil entered in to
his celle / yt is to wit / if we think on god / the devil shall not enter in
to the celle of our soul / but if we think on worldly things / anon he
shall enter and slay us by sins.

An holy man prayed to god that he might see ye fendes. To whom was answered /
you have none need to see thyn adversaries / but he prayed always to god yt he
would show them to hy^. And anon by reuelacyon dyuyne he saw a great legyon
of fendes assembled on a montayne like as bees which flee about men on all
sides / but ye angels of god were by that chaced away the fendes and put them
abacke.

An holy old man had two neyghbour^ / of whom ye one was a stranger and ye
other of the Royame. The stranger was slothful / and ye other was much
dylygent. It happed yt the stranger deyed / and anon ye holy man yt was his
neighbor saw by reuelaco^n ye angels ledyng his soul in to Joy. And as he
supposed to have entered in to heaven was made questyon of hy^ / yt is to wit if
he ought to enter. Then he herd a voys from on high which said it is
certain yt this stranger has be a little neclygent / but for as much yt he
is a strauger and yt he has do penance opene the yate to hy^. Some after came
to the article of death ye dylygent which was of ye co^^re / and anon his
friends came to see hy^ / but he deyed. And also the holy man knowing yt he was
deed / looked if he might see changellys come / like as he saw they^ come to ye
soul of ye stranger / but he saw none appear. Then all heavy and
admerualled be done flat to ye earth and said / alas ye stranger yt was
much sloth is in heaven / and this man yt was much dylygent may have none
enter. Then was said to hy^ yt he that was dylygent had at hour of his death
sorowed for his te^porel goods and for his fre^des which wept for hy^ / but yt
strau^had none fre^des at his death / and by this appears ye none ought to
present to hy^ yt deyeth his childern or his wife / to the end yt his health
should not be let.

An other holy man said yt there was an hermyte in ye hermytage of the cite of
Nyle / to whom a good seculer man mynystred to hy^ all his necessytees / and in
this cite was a man much rich and right evil which deyed / and was born
with great honor by ye bishop and pryncypalles of ye town / with great no^bre
of torches unto his sepulture. This good seculer man yt had seen this great
sole^pnyte / went soon after to thermyte / for to delyuere to hy^ yt was
necessary / but when he came to thermytage / he found yt this holy man had be
eten of wild bestes / then he fylle his face to ye ground flat /
co^cludyng yt he would not arise till he knew fro whens this thing proceeded /
yt is to wit / yt ye rich man which was so perverse had had so great honor
in his death. And ye holy hermyte yt served day and night god was alone deed
pyteously / and because he was herfore in devout oryson / there came an angel
to hy^ ye said / yt the rich man had had these goods and worldly honors /
for to reward hy^ for some small good deeds which he had done in his life /
but not withsta^dyng he was in way of da^ynaco^n for his sins yt he had
co^mysed. But the solytary hermyte / because he had be somewhat defoyled of
sy^ne where of he had contryco^n / he had suffered this evil / because he was
clean tofore god / and fynably have rest perdurable / and so he was comforted
and returned praysyng god. An holy man said yt he had seen a much aged woman a
virgyne / of whom he asked wherefore she had chose^ the astate of virgynyte. To
whom she answered syghynly / alas holy fader wha^ I was young. I had my fader
well attempred and soft. Just and virtuous in co^uersaco^n / the which was
feeble and often seek and was so secret in his deeds / yt sometime his neighbors
in long time saw hy^ not / and occupied his time to labor his land. And if
by adventure he found himself well dysposed / then bare he ye fruit of his
labor in to his house But ye most great part of ye time he was seek in his
bed / and spack so little that they yt had not known hy^ / would have said
yt he had be dombe. But all contrary I had my mother / she was fair without
attemperau^ce and more dyshonest in co^uersaco^n than all ye wy^men of this
regyon / she was replenysshed with all vices / as of evil words / engendryng
noyses and dyssenco^ns between friends / she was dronklew and lecherous / and
wasted all our goods / for she had ye charge of all the house because yt my
fader was seek. And how be it yt she was cause of the sin of Infenyte no^bre
of people by her evil manners. Nevertheless she was never seek / but was hole of
her body unto the death. Among these things it happed yt my fader by the
vyolence of his great sekenesses becam fro life to death. And Incontinent ye
air began to meue / to rain and thondre so much yt his body might not be
buried unto the third day / because of ye great habundau^ce of rain. That
seeing ye neighbors meruaylled saying yt it was to doubt yt this man was deed
in dedely sin / and yt he had so evil lived / that the air in sign of
repreef might not suffer yt he should be buried Nevertheless to the end yt the
body should not infecte the house / during ye rain and tempest we bare hy^ to
therthe. After my mode which used evil her body and made an open bordell of
our house dyspended all yt we had. And fynably she came at her last day and
deyed. In the death of whom it seemed to eueryche yt the air and the other
elements did to her honor in her obsequyes. For ye air was clear and clean
without wind without thonder / and without any tempeste. Then I deported in
my young age / and by fastings and afflycco^ns I began to refrain the mocyons
of lechery in my body / and on an even I began to think / whether it were
better for to follow yt life of my fader / or of my mother. And also I
considered yt my fader during his life had never welthe / but in all myserye he
fynysshed his days. and yet in the end with great pain he was buried. And also
I doubted if his life had be good / because he had so many euylles / and so I
concluded to live as my mother had done / and purposed in my self to follow
her. But it happed yt during this thought I fylle a sleep. And anon after there
appeared to me a man with a dreadful sight which asked me what I thought. And
how well I refused to say to hy^ my thought. Always in the end in askyng him
forgyuenes I confessed to hy^ my thoughts / and that done he said to me / come
with me / and I shall show to the thy fader and thy mother and after you shall
these which life of they^ thou wylt. Then he took me by the hand / and
brought me in to a field sweet and pleasant / where as was great habundau^ce
of fruytes. And anon came my fader which enbrached me and kyssed me calling me
his daughter / and I enbrached him again / prayeng him yt I might dwell with
hy^ / the which said to me / my daughter you may not now dwell here / but if
you wylt you shall come hither shortly. And anon he yt ladde me withdrewe me and
said. I shall show the thy mother that brenneth in the pytte of hell / and so
he ladde me in to a derke place where as were all myserye / wepynges and
wayllynges. There was a for^ays full of pytche boyllyng with infenyte nombre of
fendes of so honyble figure yt may not be said / and thus when I beheld sow a
down. I beheld my mother brennyng in ye formays unto the neck / which grynted
her teeth by force of great pain. And when she saw me she began to cry /
helas my daughter I suffer this pain for my demerytes / for I have despised
the rule of sobrenes. Alas I supposed not yt the works of fornycacyon should
be thus punysshed / ne for glotonye I should have run in to this dapnaco^n.
Now you see that for my delytes and pleasau^ces and for the brekyng of the
commandments of god I endure these pains which be so great yt no tongue
may express / ne heart think / and therefore my daughter I pray the yt you have
pity and mercy on me that brenne in this fire without co^sumyng. Behold
pyteously my pain / and lene me thy hand for to draw me out from this pain.
Then I said alas my mother. I dar not for the multitude of fendes which be
here assystent / then she began more strongly to cry in saying / alas my
daughter / art you so cruel yt you despysest the teeres of thy wretched mother /
remember yt when I childed and bare the / and of ye grievous pains yt I had for
ye And anon I began to weep so gretely and so loud yt they of ye house came^
and saw me in my bed how meruayllously I had wept / to whom I recou^ted all
the caas and vysyon. And therefore I have determined to follow the life of my
fader / and not the life of my mother / to the end that fynably I may come to
the glory of heaven.

An holy man said yt the Relygyous people ought to have in honor and reverence
specially three things The first the co^munycaco^n of ye holy sacrament of the
altar. The second is the table where they ete and drink. The third is the
bacyn wherein they wesshe their feet. The same holy man recou^teth an example of
an holy man / which ete ones with a great multitude of relygyous men / and so
doing him seemed that some of them ete ho^ny / other ete bread the other foul
ordure / whereof he meruaylled / and prayed to god that he would show to hy^
what sygnefyd this sight of one manner mete which had be set to they^ all.
Then came a voys saying to him / yt they yt ete ho^ny ben they yt come to ye
table of the holy sacrament / with dread and reverence to god / and pray god
without cessyng / and their prayer mou^teth up to heaven with encence. But they
yt ete bread / ben they that ete in yeuyng thankynges to god / because they
know ye benefayt^ of god and ye goods that they receive of him. And ye other
which ete of thordure and fylthe / ben they that grutche against god / and
praise him not / but we ought not to do so. For we ought always to praise and
thank him / to the end that we may accomplysshe that which he commands us
saying / if ye ete or if ye drink or if ye do any other thing / do ye it all
in the name of god.

Of signs and miracles.
Here follows an other treatise where in ben recyted and reherced the signs

The abbot Sysoy said yt he being with thabbot Macharye / he saw in a field
where they did repe in harvest / and a woman gadryng and glenyng ye strawes of

wept. And the master of ye field said to him yt her husbonde had taken and
received to keep of a man a certain some of money which he had hid in a
place unknown / for the more surelyer to keep it. And after he was prevented

to hy^ to keep the which anon began to speak and said. It is hyd in my
chamber under ye foot of my bed. Then said to hy^ ye holy man Macharye. Go
and rest the unto the day of Judgment / of which thing his brethren were
gretely admeruaylled and adradde / and fylle down all to the feet of the holy
man / which said to them. Helas my brethern this has not ^e done for the
love of me / for I am as nothing / but it has be done for to socour this poor
woman and her poor orphans which be faderles. And know ye verily / yt if ye
live holyly and ryghtwysly / all yt ye shall ask of god / god shall grant it
to you lightly. Thus then went they forth in to ye house of ye poor wedowe /

orysons of an holy man / to tarry there / as immovable by the space of.x. days

And incontinent he aroos and leep gooyng forth. That seeing the fader entered in

TWo holy men prayden to god that he would show to them what Joy they had
won in their hermytage. To the which was showed / that there was a man married
in Egypt / the which was named Eucharystius / and his wife named Marye / the
which had gotten more glory in heaven / than had the said two holy
brethern. Then they went Incontinent unto the house of the the said
Eucharystius. And when they were comen thither / they found his wife at home /
which said to them that her housbonde was goon in to the field to keep sheep
/ and that he should come home at even. Then they concluded to abide and
tarry for him. The even comen / the sheepherde bringing his sheep came home to
his house. And seeing these two holy men / made ready their souper and wesshe
their feet. That done they said to him / that they would neither ete ne drink
in that hons / tylle that he had told to them what life he and his wife
ledden to gydre. Then Eucharystius in great humylyte and reverence said to
them. I am an herdeman and keep sheep / and so see here my wife. And
furthermore the holy men inquired of their astate / but he durst not say the
troth / for teschewe vain glory / till that they said to him. Our lord has
sent us hither to the. That herynge Eucharystius was a ferde / and said to
them / loo here we have sheep of our parents and friends / and that which
comes to us of them / we depart it in to three parties / the first part to
give to the poor and nedy / the second for to lodge the pylgryms / and the
third for our living and sustentacyon. And sith that we have be married / we
have not deffoyled our self by lecherye / but my wife is a clean virgyne And
we sleep each of us all alone / well far that one from that other. And when
the night comes we clothe us with sackes / but on the day we take again our
clothes accustomed / and this thing was never shewde ne came to knowledge of any
person till this hour This thing herd of ye holy men they were sore abashed

Thabbot Macharius of Egypt came fro Sychye unto the mountain of Nytrye / to
the monastery of the abbot Pambo. And when the brethern saw him / they began
to say to him. Fader say to us some word edyfycatyf. To whom he answered. I
am not yet a very monk / but oonly I have seen the monks / nevertheless at
your request I shall say some little word. On a time being in my celle / my
thoughts chydden me / and said to me goo in to deserte / and consydere all
that you shall see / but I feryng that these thoughts camen by ye moyen of ye
devil. I resysted it by ye space of five year / the which accomplysshed I
went in to deserte in an hermytage / and there I saw a ponde to ye which came
for to drink diverse bestes / among whom I saw two men all naked which
drank / and anon wenyng yt this had be Illusyon of an evil speryte / began to
dread and tremble / ye seeing ye two men / they said to me. Be nothing aferde /
for we be men / and anon I asked they^ from whens they were / and they
answered / we ben of this hermytage / and this.xl. year we never issued out /
but as this hour by our both consent we ben comen hither. That one of them was
an Egypcyen / and that other of Thebes They asked me / if ye water of ye world
came in his time / as that of thermytage. And if the world had suffysaunce in
his habundaunce / to whom I said ye. And I demanded them how that I might be
very relygyous / to which they answered me / if a man renounce not the world
/ and all the goods of the same / he may not be a very Relygyous man. Then
I said to them well but I am feeble and frail / and may not do as ye say.
Then they said to me / if thou may not / go and by wayle thy sins in thy
celle. And furthermore I asked them / wherefore they were naked / and if they
felt any cold in winter / or any hete in somer. And they answered me / god
has done to us this preuylege / that in winter we feel no cold / ne in somer
none hete. And then I said to them. My friends I pray you pardonne me / for
I say to you surely. I am not yet a very monk.

Thabbot Sysoy was on a time in the mountain of the holy fader Anthonye / and
because that his servant came not / he was there by the space of ten months
without seeing of any person. After the.x. months he walked in the deserte
and saw there an hunter / to whom he demanded fro whens he came and how long
he had be there To whom he answered / verily fair fader I have been here.xi.
months / and I never saw person but the. Then he returned in to his
celle knockyng his breast and saying. Alas Sysoy / thou wendest to have done
great penance / for to be resydent.x. months without to issue or to go out
of thy celle / but thou have not do so much as that seculer / which for to
hunte has been.xi. months in this deserte.

The same self Sysoy when he was in his celle / he shytte always his door /
and when the day of his death was comen / the holy faders that were about him
saw his vysage shynyng as the son he said / so see here thabbot Anthonye
that comes. And soon after he said / loo see the prophets which comen in a
great multitude. And then they saw his vysage more shynynge than to fore.
And then he began to say / loo here is the legyon of thappostles which
comen to comfort me. Then after his vysage becam more clerer the half than
it was. And anon he seemed to them that were assystent that be spoke to some
other than hem self / but they saw not to whom he spoke. They then
demanded to whom he spoke. And he answered / loo here ben the angellys which
be comen for to fetch me. And I pr^ye them that they will suffer me a while
to do my penance for my sins. Then sayden the holy faders Alas thou have
not whereof to do penance. And he answered. My friends I know not / if ever I
did penance to god agreeable And then they knew yt he was parfyght. And yet
again his v^age became more clerer than the sonn^ / and then be said to
them. Behold my brethern / loo here is god which comes acco^panyed with his
angelly^. Then herd they a voys which said. Bear ye to heaven the vessel of
dylecco^n of this hermytage / that is named Sysoy And Incontinent he rendered
up his soul. And there came a merueyllous clerenesse in his celle / and an
odoure so sweet / that eueryche of them meruaylled. The holy faders sayden that
thabbot named Or never lied / ne swear / ne cursed any body / and that he
never said word that might engendre any sclaunder in his neighbor. The same
said to his dyscyple / beware that thou speak not in this celle any evil word
/ yt might enduce the to do evil. Two holy men walked on a time through the
deserts of Sychye. And in walkyng they herd a voys of a person which was in
a fosse or cave / wherefore they began to search and seek / where they might
enter in to it / there as they herd the voys. And when they had founden it /
they entered in and found there an holy virgyne much ancient and old /
which was strongely seek. Then they said to her / good woman how art thou
comen hither / and who is he that here admynystred to the thy necessytees.
Then she answered to them. My friends / it is.xxxviij. year passed sith I
came in to this cave and have served god and lived with rotes. Sith which time
I never saw other men than you that been here by the will of god / and to the end
that ye burye me And that said / she deyed Incontinent Then these two holy
faders gaaf praysyng to god / and buried her body and after they departed
thens.

It is recounted of an hermyte which was clothed with a sack and walked three
days long by thermytage. At the end whereof he came to a stone and mounted
upon it / but by nethe he saw grene grass / and a man which ete and fed
him as a brute best / he then went down secretly and took him. But anon
as this man saw hy^ self taken / he began to moeue and strogle in such wise
that he escaped and fled from him. That seeing the brother began to cry and
ran after him saying. Abide me and tarry fair fader / for I follow the for
the honor of god Then the brother took of his Robe and threw it from him /
and ran after this holy man. That seeing the holy fader / abode him surely in
saying these words. Sith that thou haste renounced the goods of the world
here where we be in castyng away thy vestyment. I shall abide. Thus the brother
came and asked counsel of the holy man / and he said to him. Eschew the men
and be peasyble without ouermoche spekyng / and thou shall be saved. Like a
Relygyous ought to flee worldly things / so ought he to keep scylence and be
stylle when it is time.

An holy hermyte dwelled some time with some brethern that were in ye hermytage
named Raython / where as there were.lxx. trees of palm / which is the place
where as Moses arrived when he fled out of Egypt / with the people of
Israel. To which brethern one time among the other / the same hermyte
reherced this that follows / in saying. On a time I went by thermytages /
desiring to find some good servant to god / and in walkyng four days and
four nyghtes / the which days passed I found an hole / and in lokyng therein
I saw a man within / whom I called to the end that he should come out / that
I might sale we him / but he re^eued not / whereby I know that he was deed. And
then no thing dredyng I entered in / and took his scapulary / and anon he
fill to pouldre. Then somewhat doubtyng. I went through the deserte and came to
an other fosse / in the which dwelled an holy man / as I well knew afterward
/ whereof I was glad. And wenyng that there had be therein some man. I asked if
there were any man within / but there was no person. And then I went out in
saying to myself / that some man dwelled there / wherefore he hopyng that soon
he should come / and I concluded to abide and tarry. And the night coming on. I
saw coming against me wild oxen / after whom came the holy man that dwelled
there / the which was so naked / that he had no party of his body that was
covered / but oonly his preuy members / which were covered with his here. I
then approchyng to him he fylle down in prayer / wenyng that I had be a
speryte / but I seeing his Ignorance said to him. O servant of god come
hardely and be not aferde / for I am a man as you art / behold and touch me to
the end that you be certain / His prayer achyeued he beheld me / and somewhat
comforted brought me in / in to his hole / and demanded me wherefore I was come
thither. To whom I answered. I am come hither for to know if there were here any
servant of god / and I am not defrauded of my desire / sith that I have found
the. And anon I demanded hy^ how looge time it was passed / that he was comen
to dwell there / and what he ete / and how he lived being all naked / to the
which he answered me. I was first in ^habbaye of Thebayde / where I made
mattes / and other handewerkes. Then I though by my self / that it were
^etter for me to go all allone in to some place / to the end that I might have
the ^etter rest in my conscience / and that I might receive the pylgryms at mine
ease / and to win more of mine work / and therefore I departed / and made a
^elle where I dwell / and there came to me much people for to delyuere to me
work. And anon as I had assembled and gadred any good / anon I went and
d^strybuted it to the poor people / but the fend which is enuyous upon good
men / wenynge to have made me to le^e the glory of heaven / admonested a
virgyne / that she should bring to me some work to make / the which I
wrought. And after she came again and brought more / so long that bytweyne her
^ me we had some famylyaryte / and som^yme she touched and held me by the
h^nde / and also otherwhyle I went to et^ and drink in her house. And fynably
^e consented both two to the sin of the flesh / and continued in the same
sy^^te the space of.vi. months. Afte^ ^^ bethought me saying in my self. ^
as I must ones deye and I wot not ^an / and I know well that if I deye in
his sin. I shall be perpetuelly dampened. For if a man have corrupt the wife
of a man / he ought to be punysshed right rygorously. Then by much more
strenger reason / he that corrupted the spouse of god he ought to be much more
gryeuously punysshed / wherefore I being soroufull of my great sin / left all
my goods with the same woman / and came by (...) to this hermytage / where as
(...) cave / this pytte / and this pal^^ (...) he has brought me fruit ^^
(...) yearly / whereby I live. Thus ^^ssyon of time mine here is ben (...) / and my
clothyng is roten. And (...) with my here is the secret and sha^^ (...) parties
of my body. Further^^^ I demanded him if he had had ^^^ ^^ete temptaco^ns
at beginning (...) he came thither first / and he answe^^ ^^^^e beginning when
I came hy^^^ I was strongly persecuted of the (...) in so much that I could
not p^^ye to god / but lay down on ye ground ^ ^yed him mercy And thus as I
(...) this sorrow / there came a man and as^^^ ^e what thing I had / to whom I
sa^^ yt I was strongely vexed of the guy^^^^. Then he put his hand in me and
^^^e out my guysyer and took away ^^^^aladye / and put it in a cloth And (...)
he put it again in his place and said to me / serve god now / for you art all
ho^. And after that I had neither gryef ^^payne. And the said hermyte said /
that he had required him that he might dwell there with him / but he said to
him that he should not conne well surmou^te the temptacyons of the fend. And
then the said hermyte prayed him yt he would pray for him to god / and anon
after departed. This have I recounted said thermyte for to edefye you in our
savior Ihesu christ. An holy old man that had be made bishop of the cite of
Exyrynque said thus / me seemed on a time ye I entered in to an hermytage in to
the deppest thereof for to see if I should find any of ye servants of Ihesu
christ. And for to make my Journey I took four loves and a little water / and
went four days long / the which passed I wist not what I should do / for I
was weary / and also had no more mete / but in good trust and hope I began again
to walk other four days without to dry^ke or to ete. Thus then what for
fasting and for pain of walkyng I fylle down as I had been deed. Then came a
man that with his finger touched me in my lyppes / and anon I came in to my
first strength / and supposed not to have walked / ne had had any hungre or
thurst / so I aroos and walked yet.iiij. days / of which I was trauaylled as
tofore is said / but anon came he that first had comforted me / and touched me
again with his finger / and anon I was guarysshed / yet after all this yet I
walked and continued by the space of.xvij. days / the which passed I found a
little house / and a palm tree to fore the door / within the said house there
dwelled an holy hermyte / the which was cladde with his heeres all white for
age / whereof he was horrible to look upon. And when he saw me / he fylle down
and put him self to prayer / wenyng yt I had be some Illusyon / but after
seeing that I was a man / he took me by the hand and demanded me / how durst
thou come hither / and also how do they yt ben in the world / ben there yet
persecuco^ns as there was wont to be. Then I answered to him. I am come hither
for to see the / but the persecuco^ns cessen by the will of god. Then I
demanded him / and you now tell to me how you art come hither / and Incontinent
with great wepyngis and wayllynges he said. I was sometime a bishop / but to
eschew the pains and martyrdoms that tynfydeles would do to me. I sacrefyed
to their gods / in leuyng the very god of gods / how be it afterward I
thought in my self / yt my sin was much great / and yt I had offended god
right gretely / thus for to do penance I am comen hither / it is now.xlviij.
year for to know / if god have forgyuen me my sin / and I live by the fruit
of this palm tree / and have no consolaco^n ne comfort sith the said time
of.xlviij. year unto this hour / for in this year I have had comfort of god And
in this saying he fill down and made his prayers to god / his prayers fynysshed
he came again to me. And when I looked on his vysage I was abashed for it was all
enfla^med as fire. And anon he said to me / have you no fere / for god has
sent the hither for to burye me / and in this saying he deyed / then I took
ye one half of my rob / and wrapped the holy body therein and put it in to
therthe. And inco^tynent when he was buried / the palm tree becam all dry /
and his house fill down to the ground Then in weeping I began to pray god yt
he would give to me this palm and fontayne / to the end yt I might acco^plysshe
there the remenau^t of my lift. But I knowing yt it was not his will I
returned in to the world. And in coming again I found him which had touched
my lyppes first / the which comforted me / and so I came again to my brethern /
and recou^ted to them yt which I had seen / in warnyng they^ yt they should
have good affyau^ce and trust in ye mercy of god.

A brother asked of an holy fader what thing in the prayer saves the person
either the words ye ben ^onteyned in the same / or thyntenco^n (...) the
which it is said. To whom he answered / yt it is thyntenco^n. Then ^ayd ye
brother. I know a man yt prayed / and in prayeng came in his thought to kn^we
what dyfference it was between ^^e soul of a ryghtwysman / and ye soul of a
sinner as touching and going out. And for so much god seey^g his entenco^n to
the end yt he should not be deceived / he sent to him a wulf in to his celle /
the which took his clothes in his mouth / and drew the brother unto an other
monastery / where as dwelled a solytary man greatly reno^med / which approached
and drew nyghe his death. And anon ye brother saw yt there were made ready
lamps and tapres for ye death of this solytary man / all in like wise as god
had done so much good to they^ of the cite by his moyen. And the people said
/ if this holy man deye / we ben all lost. And when it came to ye hour of his
death / this brother saw a devil which had a great staff all bre^nyng which
came upon this solytarye man / and threw ye fire to his heart / and drew out
ye soul in saying / all in likewise as this man has not given to me any rest
ne to himself / all in likewise I shall have no pity on hy^. And in thus
saying he bare away his soul to hell After the same brother entered in to the
cite and found a seek man unto whom no man did any service. And with him he
abode a day for to comfort him / and when the hour came yt he should deye he
saw saint Mychall and thangell Gabryell / that one or the right side and that
other on the lift ^yde of this man ^o^ to (...) soul / and prayed to the soul
yt it would come out / but it would not / and therefore said Gabryell to saint
Mychaell. Take this soul / to the end yt we go hens. Saint Mychaell answerde
God has commanded us / that with vyolence we shall not take it away / and
therefore we shall suffer it to come out and also saint Mychaell cried / lord
god what shall we do with this soul / for it will not come for our prayers.
Then came a voys saying. Lo I send to him Dauyd and all ye other prophets /
to the end yt he heryng ye swetenes of their harpes ye soul may come out. And
anon Dauyd with his harp / and the other prophets descended / which made so
sweet an armonye / yt ye soul anon sprange out / and was received in to the
hondes of saint Mychaell / and with great Joy he bare it in to heaven.

The same brother said yt an holy man after yt he had sold in a cite nyghe by
his hermytage some small works / as paners and hottes / he satte at yate of
a rich man which lay on deyeng. And anon he saw black horses / and men
rydyng on them much horrible and black / which eueryche of them had in
their hands staves full of fire. And when they were at this yate they
descended and set their horses at door / and after they entered in hastily
and came to ye hedde of the rich seek man. Incontinent as he saw them / he
began to cry saying. My god have mercy on me Then they answered to him.
Reme^brest the now of thy god when you see nothing / and when ye son of
Justice is faylled yt / it is now no time / wherefore have you not cried mercy to
god to fore this hour whiles you myghtest do some what / there is now no more hope
/ for you art ours. And in this saying they took the soul and bare it to hell.

The holy faders sayden that an holy man walkyng by the deserte saw two angels
one on ye right and ye other on the lift side which acco^panyed hy^ / and in
going they found a karayne / then the good man stopped his nose for ye
stenche and thangels also. Then said ye good man to thangels. Feel ye this
stenche / they answered Nay / but for as much as you stoppest thy nose / right
so do we / for we have horror on the souls that be stynkyng by sin.

Here begynnen seven chapytres / the which the abbot Moses sent to the abbot
Permenius. And who that keeps them well / shall be delivered from pain
eternal.


THe abbot Moses said that a man ought to be as a deed man to his felawe / and
verily to his friend / to the end / that he Judge not ne condemn him in his
operacyons. Item the same said / that a man ought to mortefye himself / to
fore his soul spring out of his body / to the end that he offend none. He
said also if a man repute not himself a sinner / he shall not be enhaunced
tofore god. Then a brother asked him / what it was to repent himself a
sinner. The holy man answered that it was to think on his sins / and no
thing on the sins of his neighbors. For who ye thinks on his own /
thinks not on them of his neighbors. The same holy man said furthermore /
if ye work accord not with the prayer / it prouffyteth no thing. Then
asked the brother / what is the work that accords with prayer. The holy man
answered / that he do not that which he prays contrary. As if a man pray
to god to take away from him his sin / and he daily does sin / but it
behooves the work be consonant to his prayer / ne that in no wise he do
sin / ne after his own will. For a man has more merit when he refrayneth
his propre will for the honor of god pryncypally.

A brother demanded of this holy man / what is it that helps a man in all
his labors and pains. He answered that it was god. For it is written in the
psalmyste. God is our refuge / strength and virtue in trybulaco^ns which
persecute us strongely.

A brother asked him what prouffyten the fastings and wakynges that men make.
The holy man answered / that they make the soul humble and meke. For it is
written. Lord god behold my mekenes and my labor / and forgive me my sins /
if it pleases the. And therefore if we take on us pain / god shall have pity
and mercy on us. A brother demanded of an old fader / what ought a man to do
again the temptaco^ns of the fend. To whom he answered / he ought first to
weep to the end that god help him. And if he pray devoutly / god shall socoure
him. For it is written. If god help me. I fere no man.

A brother asked if a bondeman have trespaced / what shall he say to his lord
/ if he will punysshe him. To this he answered that he should say. My lord I
have trespaced / but if it please the. I pray the to pardonne me / and anon
his master shall forgive hy^. Thus we that be bound and servants to god /
when we have sinned / and we return to him in confessyng our sins / he will
pardonne us Incontinent The end of our operacyons is not to Judge any person.
For when god slew all the first begoten in Egypt / there was not one house but
there was one therein deed. Then asked a brother what was that that so say.
And he answered to him / that if we beheld well our sins / we should think
no thing of the sins of our neighbors. It is great folly to a man to
forsake his deed corpse in his house / for to go and by weep one in his
neighbors house he is deed toward his neighbor / the which thinks not on
the works of other / and does no harm to any person / ne thinks none
evil in his courage / the which also despyseth no man because he is a sinner /
and the which is not united to him that does evil to his neighbor / ne
speaks ill of any person / but said to him self. God knows the thought of
every man / and I not. It behooves then to flee the detractours. For it is
said in ye gospel Judge no man / to the end that ye be not Iuged of god. One
ought not also hate any person / though he were his enemy. Ne despise a man
because he chydeth with his neighbor. For otherwise thou sholdest have no
rest ne peace in thy conscience.

An other old fader said / thou man living think that thy god is born of the
virgyne Marye for the love of the / he has be made man and always abides god
/ he has be made a little child / he was a redar and prechar when he took the
book in the synagoge and said. The speryte of god is upon me / by cause he that
has enoynted me / has sent me to preche the gospel to the poor sinners /
he had be subdeken / when he chaced out of the temple they^ that sold and
them that bought / he was deken when he weeshe the feet of his appostles / in
co^mau^dyng them to wesshe ye feet of their brethern / he was made priest when
he abode in ye myddell of the temple techynge them / he was made bishop in
taking the bread and in delyueryng to his dyscyples / he has be beten for ye
love of the / he has be crucyfyed / he aroos the third day And after
ascended in to heaven / and all for us / and all he has done for to save us.
And nevertheless we will nothing endure ne suffer for the love of him Late us
then be sobre and wake we / pray we devoutly and keep we his commandments
to the end that we may be saved / was not Joseph sold in to Egypt in to a
strange land. The three childern were they not brought prisoners in to
Babylon. And how well they had no knowledge / god was their help and were saved
in the end / for as much as they dradde / who that gives him all to god has
no free will / but does as god commands him without pain of conscience. And
if thou wylt do after thyn own will without help of god / thou shall have
ouermoche pain in thy conscience.

A brother asked of thabbot Pastor. fader what is yt to say / that one ought
not to think on ye next day following. The holy man answered / that is to
understand of a man yt is in temptacyon / that is to say / that he ought to
resyste it ye same day / without to think to resyste it on the morn.

A brother demanded from whens it came / that a man how well he be a great
sinner / nevertheless he is not a shamed to detracte the reno^mee and fame of
an other. To whom the holy man answered by such a parable / there was a poor
man which had a wife. the which saw an other woman that was much fayrer
than his wife with out comparyson / and desired her and did so much that he
had her in marriage / but she was as poor as that other. It happed then /
that tho two wives / went with her husbonde to a market. And by cause they
were both naked / they put them self in a tonne but that one seeing that the
people were departed / sprang out of the tonne / and found old clothes and
rags / covered her in such wise / that she might well goo among the people
/ without to have any shame. Then that other woman having thereof envy said
to her husbonde. This folysshe woman is all naked / and nevertheless she is
not a shamed to goo among the people. Then answered to her the husbonde in
great anger / she has some what covered and hid her pouerte and confusyon /
but as for the / thou art all naked / and yet thou mockeste her as much as
thou may. Thus said the holy fader / is each man a detractour / the which
not consyderyng his own sins / cesseth not to say evil of an other which
ben better than he.

The abbot Johan said to some of his brethern / that there were three
phylosophres the which were good friends to gydre. Of which one of them
deyeng left his child to that other. And when he was great / he defoylled the
wife of his moneytour / wherefore he was put out of the house. And how well that
he did great penance / nevertheless the philosopher would not suffer him to
reentre in to his house. But said to him that he should goo among them that
were Iuged to the death for to dygge and gadre with them metal within the River
three year long. And when he had so done and fulfilled that penance / he
should return to the phylosophre and than he would receive him. The which
thing he did / and then he said to him goo yet unto three years end / and
give thy goods to them that shall wrong and say to the Iniuryes / for the
love of god / the which he did. Then the phylosophre said to him Goo thou
to the Cite of Athenes / to the end that thou learn science. And in coming
thither he found at the yate of Athenes a phylosophre which was deputeth there
/ for to preue them that came for to study / and to Iniurye them for to see
their pacyence. Then this philosopher Iniuryed meruayllously this young man
for to know if he had pacyence. And anon he began to lawhe. Then the
phylosophre demanded and asked him wherefore he laughed / seen the Iniuryes
that he said to him. To whom the young man answered. I have this three year
paste given of my goods for to be Iniuryed / and now I am Iniuryed with out
that it cost me any thing / wherefore me seems for this cause I have matter to
laughe. Then said to him the phylosophre / my child enter and goo in to the
Cite / for thou art pacyente enough for to study phylosophye And after that
the abbot Johan had reherced this that said is / he said such words. My
brethern the yate of Athenes is the yate of heaven wherein we ought to enter /
for many trybulacyons and Iniuryes as have done our predecessors.

Thabbot Johan said / a sinful soul that will do penance / is as a fair
whoman which has been common to every man / to whom came a great lord that said
to her / if thou will promise to me chastyte / and that thou will no more give
the to sin. I shall take the to marriage. The which so promised him. And by
that moyen she was married to him. They that were Amerous and had loved her /
seeing that she was married to one so mighty a man sayden / if we knock at
yate for to speak to her / and to accomplysshe our flesshely will and desire /
the lord shall punysshe us right gryeuously. But it is better for us to go
behind the house and to syffle and whystle / to the end that she thereby
understand and come to us. And so went anon to wystle wenynge to begyle her
/ but to the end that she would not here them / she stopped her eres / and
hid her in the secretest places of the house. In like wise this common woman is
our soul. The lovers that been the vices. The prince and the lord that
espouseth our soul is almighty god. The house is the Royalme of heaven. The
whystlers ben the fendes of hell. And for so much as our soul which had
be common to all vices / is become chaste by good operacyons / always she has
recours to her spouse which is god the souerayn lord / and thus she is
vaynquysshour of the enemies.

Thabbot Pastor said that the gospel says / he yt has one robe should go
selle it and by him a glayue or sword Which ought thus to be understand / he
that has the robe of rest of the flesh / let him selle hit / that is to
say / that he leave it / and bye the swerd of parfyght resystence for to fight
against the fend. The said abbot Pastor said that in Egypt was an holy fader /
to whom mynystred a man and a virgyne. So it happed on a day / that both two
came to gydre to admynystre the necessytees to this holy man And by cause that
in so doing they were surprysed of the night / both two were constrained to
lie in the celle of the holy man / the which lied between them both a matte
to the end that the one should not touch that other / but during the night /
the man that served the holy man corrupted the said virgyne. And the morning
he went his way without to making any semblaunt. The holy man that knowing
said no thing to them. But on an other time when they returned he followed
them herynge their talkyng and words / which sayden thus between them /
wenest thou that this holy man knows not our sin. And then in a
compunccyon of heart / they returned to him saying. Alas fair fader / thou
know how we have offended our maker. And therefore if it please the / give to
us wholesome penance. And anon he gaaf to them a rule and a manner how they
ought for to live / to the end that their sin were forgyuen. And sith they
went / and were after much constau^t against the temptacyons.

A philosopher demanded and asked of Saint Anthonye sayng. Fader how may
thou have consolacyon when thou haste no books to read on Saint Anthonye
answered / my book is nature humayne created of god / in the which when I
consider well I find therein things as meruayllous / an thu fyndest in thy
books.

A brother coming to thabbot Macharye at myddaye / began to say / alas I deye
for thurst / give me to drink. Then answered Macharye / be thou suffysed
with this shadow / for there be many pylgryms / and maryners upon the sea /
which have great need / and nevertheless they may not have it. The same brother
demanded him of the virtue of contynence. To whom the holy man Macharye said.
By the space of.xx. year. I have not dronken ne eten my fylle. For during that
time. I have weyed my bread and mesured my water drynkyng and etyng by mesure
And I have never slept but against the walls stondyng right up / and therefore I
begin to wexe sobre and contynent. A brother demanded and asked / if I goo
with my brother / or with my mother ought I to ete wit them. The holy man
answered. Thou ought not to ete with any woman.

A brother asked of an holy man / if the thought against the sin of the
flesh is sin or no. The holy man answered / how well said he that the evil
thought comes not always to effect / nevertheless it lets the soul to be
lift up in contemplacyon. And therefore a man chaste and contynent ought to
put and cast it away as soon as it comes / and by this moyen he shall not
be let in his orysons prayers and contemplacyons.

The same said if a man have no cogytacyons ne thoughts / he is lykened to a
brute best / as who should say It is not possible / but that a man have
always some temptacyons / but all in like wise as the fend does his office in
temptyng us. Right so ought we to do in resystyng him / if we pray to god
contynuelly / the fend shall flee away / think on god / and thou shall
overcome him / fight well / and in the end thou shall be crowned. Saint
Syncletyce said / that the fend is lyghtely ouercomen of them that have no
thing / for they dread not to lose any thing. And they that be of the world
oftyme be sorry and angry for the loss of their money or other worldly goods.

The same said that they that assemble the rychesses of the world with great
pain and trauaylle of their bodies / of so much more that they get so
much more would they have. But we renounce such things that been to us
necessary for to live for the honor of our savior Ihesu christ.

An holy man said / that he that is prompte to reteyne the evil sooner than
the good / is lykeneth to the fire that is hid within the stubbe. For in
such wise as the fire so hid brenneth it / right in the same wise the
malice that is hid in the mind wastes and destroys the soul by evil
operacyons that follow.

An holy man said that he that warns an other of his health / ought swetely to
exhort him / to the end that he be not unprofitable / and that his admonycyon
be auayllable.

A brother demanded and asked of an ancient old fader / wherefore is it that
my soul loves oftymes thordure and fylthe of sin. The holy man answered.
The soul oftentimes loves the passions of the body / but the spyryte of god
is he that refrayneth it. And therefore we ought to bewaylle our sins / to
the end that they be to us pardonned. Haste thou not read that Marye Magdalene
after that she had be at the Sepulcre of Ihesu christ in weeping and teres /
that god called her to him. All in like wise shall he do to the soul that
shall puryfye him self in weeping.

A brother demanded and asked an holy fader / when a man thinks not on his
defaultes / and repreueth other / is it sin. He answered that god says
thereof in the gospel. Ypocryte take away the beme that is in thyn eye / and
after thou may well see the better the festu that is in the eye of thyn
neighbor.

An other brother demanded and asked of an old ancient fader / how he might
resyste and withstand the temptacyons. The holy man answered. Take ensample at
Joseph / the which being in the age of yougthe / among the Infydeles and
Ydolatrers never would worship their Ydoles / but he was strong and
constaunt in his faith. And furthermore have mind of Job / the which in all
his trybulacyons and aduersytees praised and gaaf louynges to god / and forgate
hy^ not / for all that / that he was so much tourmented.

A knight that had done many euylles and much harm / and would convert him
to god / demanded and asked an holy man if god received the sinners in to his
grace. And the holy man answered to him / ye / and showed to him by many
reasons and auctorytees of holy scripture. Nevertheless the said knight yet
doubted. And therefore the holy man showed to him this ensample. If thy mantell
be rent or broken in any part / wylt thou inco^tnent cast it away. The
knight answered to him nay / but I shall make it again and amend it / and it
shall serve me as it did before. Then said the holy man / right so my friend
is it of god For how well yt thy soul be broken by sy^ne / nevertheless our
lord casts it not away / but by very penance and pure co^fessyon shall make
it hole again by his grace.

There was an holy man that was so sobre and solytary / that always he was ye
last yt went out of ye church / and fered not yt any body should take any
mete or drink out of his celle.

A Judge of a certain Regyon came in to the prouynce of thabbot Pastor /
thynhabytantes there / hereof aduertysed required the said abbot to require the
said Judge to do to him so much grace to pardo^ne a malefactor but the said
holy man required them that he might have three days of respyte / and they
agreed thereto / during the which time by cause that the request yt he should
make seemed to him not to be lycyte ne leeffull / he requyrod to god / that he
would suffer that he should obtain the same. So he came to fore the Judge / and
prayed for the said malefactor / but he said to him / that he would not that
which he required / because he prayed for a thief Of which answer he was
glad. And thus thabbot Pastor returned in to his celle / praysyng god of
that / that the Judge had denied to him his request.

The holy feders sayden that when Moses entered in to the sea he spacke with
god. And when he came out / he spacke to the people. In like wise ought every
good Relygyous man to do. For whiles that he is in his celle / he ought to
speak to god by devout prayer. And when he gooth out / he ought to speak with
the people in techyng them.

Certain brethern demanded and asked of the holy fader the abbot Pastor / if
they always ought to repreue the sinners. To whom it was answered by the holy
fader. If I go and pass there where as they some time be I shall say no
thing to them that I shall see sin. And never Judge ye any person / but if
ye touch them first with your hands / that is to say / if ye be not
certain of that ye say / for oftentimes some wene things / which is all
otherwise.

A brother was on a time deceived in his opinion seeing two sheues of whete to
gydre / and he supposed that he had seen a man and a woman / and therefore
without to know it / he Iuged that they co^mysed the sin of lecherye. And
after that he had well behold it / he came and smote it with his foot saying.
Cesse man to co^myse this sin / and then he was all abashed when he found
that it were two sheues of whete. Here ought we to note / that none ought to
Judge any thing but if it be well known / for it is a great peril for the
soul of him that Iugeth so lightly without to know manyfestly a thing / as he
had touched it with his hand.

An hermyte being in his hermytage was strongely tempted with deuylles which
appyred to him vysybly / and he supposed that they had been angellys. His
carnal and natural fader had a custom for to come some time and vysyte
him. So it happed that in vysytyng him that he brought an axe for to hew
down the trees and wode and bear it to his house / but the devil to the end that
he would deceive this brother appyered to him saying / loo here the devil in
semblau^ce and lykenyng of thy fader comes to the for to tempte the with an
axe / but go to mete with him and slay him Thus this byleuyng the devil went
and met with his fader and slew him. It is possible that this brother lived
ylle / and therefore god suffered that he was thus deceived of the fend. Every
Relygyous man and Relygyous woman ought to note dylygently this example / to
the end that god suffer not them thus to be tempted.

Thus fynysshed the second part of this present book.
Here follows the third part.
Here follows the third part
Here follows the third party of the life of fadres / in the which is made
mencyon of the rule and conuersaco^n of the holy faders of Egypt / and of
they^ that dwelled in Mesopotamye and Palestyne.
And first begins the prologue of thauctour in this manner.
Often times my brethern and friends ye have prayde me sith that I came again
from ye parties of beyond the sea / that for your Instruccyon and edyfycaco^n
I should recou^te to you the hystorye of my pylgremage. And how the faith of
Ihesu christ regneth in the oryent / what prycyple / what hermytes / and what
relygyouses dwell there / and if god shows there miracles Also ye have asked
how I came thither / and what prosperyte I have had there by see and by land.
And because in satysfyeng your desires and prayers of which I hope ye shall be
aided. I shall begin yt which ye ask. But I pray you understand ye
dylygently and take good head to that which I shall say you.

Of the rule and conuersaco^n of holy faders.
Of a solytarye relygyous ye dwelled in Cyrene in a lylyll house / beginning
Ante hoc trienniu^. Caplm. primu^.
IT is three year sith that my felawes and I departed fro Narbo^ne / and came the
fyfthe day after our departing to the port of Auffyke Then we would see
Cartage and vysyte the places of saints And pryncypally we came to the
sepulture of saint Cypryan martyr. The.xv. day we departed from Cartage / and
took the sea for to go in to Alexandrye / but there aroos a meruayllous great
tempest and so hydous that but if the maryners which were wise and expert had
not cast out their ancres / we had been all drowned. After this we arrived a
land in a co^tree vnhabyted. And we sent to know what regyon it was / and
what people dwelled there about. And I my self went a little way far fro ye
ryuage / and soon I saw a little house / which seemed to be covered like the
facyon and manner of a ship strongh enough and well edefyed to the end yt it
might be the more ferme and strong against the wyndes. For in that contree it
rayneth never / and when the wind blows it is more dangerous upon ye see /
than in other regyons. In ye contree was neither corn ne trees / for the land
over all remeued with ye wind as poulder and dust / except between some
montaynes was land ferme enough / where as growed a little grass / of which
were nourysshed sheep and other best The most part of ye people yt ben there
lyuen by milk. And they yt ben most rich lyuen by barle bread / for there
grows no whete but barle / the which is soon ripe. For they say in that
contree that the.xxx. day after that it is sown it is ripe / and there dwell
no folk but by cause that it is free of all trybutes / and it is the last
contree of Cyrene nygh and Ioynyng to ye deserte / the which stands between
Egypt and Affryke. By ye which Cathon fleyng. Cezar ladde his army. Thus we
came in to this little house which we saw fro far / and found therein an old
man cladde with skynnes / which with his hondes turned a mylle / ye which
received us right benygnely. And anon we asked of hy^ if there were there any
cryste^ men. Inco^tynent he began to weep for Joy when he had knowledge yt we
were christian. After yt he had desired us to prayer / and yt we had made our
prayers / he took of his robe / and made us to sytte upon it / and after
brought to us for to dyne half a barle loof / we were of us.iiij and he was ye
fyfth / and above yt he brought a few of herbs which to look upon seemed
mente / but they had the taste of swetenes like ho^nye / we were well
refresshed with this herb in so much yt we abode there.vij. days with him.
Sith after the.viij. day because that many persons came to ye house / we knew
yt he was a priest / and went with hy^ to ye church / the which was between
two montaynes made with small staves and was not much more sumptuous than ye
house of the holy man yt had received us. In this church a man but if he had
be right little might not stand up right it was so low. And furthermore we
knew in ye contree the manners of the people which sold not ne bought not any
thing / ne knew no thing of deceyuyng ne of theft / they had neither gold ne
silver / ne also none desired they to have. For I profred money to this priest
/ but he refused it and would none have. Then we gaaf to him of our robes /
the which he took gladly / for he had none that any thing was worth. This
done we reendred unto ye see / and departed fro ye co^tree.

Of the signs of Orygene which ben against the faith / beginning. Prospere
igitur. Caplm.ij.
THe.vij. day after we came in to Alexa^drye / there as ye bishops and the
relygyouses had among them great debate and strife because of ye works of
Orygene which had written against the holy scripture / and they of his sect
sayden yt how well yt he had in his books some faults / yet nevertheless he had
in they^ good doctrynes / ye other sayde^ al contrary yt it should be more
auayllable for the health of good christian people to bre^ne ye same books
co^sydred yt there were enough of other tenseygne and teache ye christian people /
seeing yt those books might do more hurt to the simple people and ygnorau^t /
than to proffyte to you wise men and clerks. I have read my self in his said
books many good doctrynes and enseygnement / but also I have fou^den many
falsytees among which was this. That is to wit yt he said that all in like
wise as that god was deed for to redeem the sinners in the tree of the cross.
All in like wise by ye same death he ought to redeem the deuylles. And his
reason was this. For it is well couenable he said / that god that is so
pyteous and merciful seen that he had suffered for to redeem the man / that he
suffered also passion for to redeem the angel which was fall in sin. This
opinion is dyrectly against the troth / and therefore it ought to be fled /
and of this opinion and other was engendered a great sedycyon among the prestes
and other men clerks and lettred. And because yt ye prestes could not appease
this error by them self They ordained a prouoost cruel and terryble which
corrected the said errors / which he did in great cruelte / that the
relygyouses were constrained to flee and had no place where they durst
enhabyte ne dwell.

Of the conuersaco^n of Jerome Iherosolymytayn beginning in latin. Igitur
inde. Caplm.iij.
Then leuynge that contree I tra^sported me in to Bethleem which is not
far fro Iherusalem / and aryued in the house of Jerome that was a man prudent
and wise meruayllously Instruct / not oonly in lettres greek and latin / but
also in ye langage hebrew / whereof he had so great reno^me / that none was
known ye durst compare to him in science. And I abode there.vi. months with
hy^ / the which contynuelly and sharply stroof against them that were evil
and obstynate. For I know that in his books is nothing but yt it has been
ouerseen and corrected of him. And pryncypally he blamed auaryce and pride. He
said also all a long ye famylyaryte ought to be among the relygyouses both
men and wy^men / and by cause he said truth many hated hy^ and specially
theretykes / for he cessed not to enpugne and repreef they^ / and after the
prestes. For he declared and repreued their vices and sins / but the Just
and good men loved him for his holy life and conuersaco^n. And therefore they
that will say yt he was an heretyke ben fools and ouerseen / for his doctrine
is good and holy. And he slept not day ne night so much he gaaf himself to
study in holy scripture. And if I had not be relygyous I would never have
departed from him. Nevertheless I left there my felawes yt followed me / and
went my self to vysyte the brethern that dwelleden in ye last part of
Egypt. For there ben there meruayllous hermytages and good relygyous folk. It
should be over long to recounte all those things / but nevertheless I shall
reherce the pryncypall part in substance.

How the abbotes were bounden to give their living to the brethern which they
receyueden in to their couentes / beginning. Hand long. Caplm.iiij.
IN an hermytage by the River of Nyle / there were many abbayes / and the
brethern of the same dwelleden to gydre / and ben subgettes to one abbot / and
do nothing after their will / but all after the will of the abbot. And for
this cause if any of them would go in solytude or wilderness for to be more
parfyght / it behooves him that he do that by the consenting of their said
abbot. For it is the first and the pryncypall virtue for to obey the
commandment of his superyor. And when they be received in to thermytage by
the auctoryte of the same abbot / there is admynystred to them bread and other
mete after their necessyte.

Of a Relygyous brother which in his hermytage was fed with heavenly bread /
beginning. Casu super illos dies. Caplm.v.
A Friar or brother solytary was a little far fro this monasterye to whom for
his living thabbot sent to him bread by two childern of which that one
was.xv. year old and that other.xij. One time among the other thus as these
two young childern went toward the said hermyte came to they^ a serpent
meruayllous cruel for to devour them / but by the bou^te and Innocence of
them the serpent lay down at their feet. And anon the youngest of them both
took him with his hand and put him in his robe and bare him to the freres in
the cloystre without any auauntyng or vain glory. Then sayden all the
relygyouses yt these two childern were saints. But the holy abbot of ye
monasterye doubtyng yt these two childern should wexe thereof proud punysshed
them right well with rods saying yt ye came from god. This knowing the said
solytary brother was much abashed as well for the betynge as for thynuasyon of
the serpent. And therefore he prayed the said abbot that he should send to him
no more any thing. And he was by yt space of.viij. days without any mete in so
much that he was all dry / but his thought was always enhau^ced to god And
there where the body faylled for hungre the soul was rauysshed to heaven. The
said abbot by thynspyraco^n of the holy ghoost went to vysyte the said
solytary relygyous for to know whereof he lived. The which seeing his abbot
came to fore him and brought him in to his celle / and as they entered in /
thabbot felt a savor of bread all hoot. And there they found a loof which
had be sent from heaven to the said brother / the which was nygh deed for
hunger. And said to the abbot that by his merytes and virtues that well and
good was comen to them. Thabbot saying the contrary / that it was by him that
was solytarye. And after in praysyng and thankyng god they brake the loof and
ete thereof / and this done the abbot returned and showed it to his brethern /
which for this cause they desyreden to be hermytes and to lead a solytary
life. In that monasterye had been two holy men which had not gone out by ye
space of.xl. year / they were never angry ne never went out of their cloystre.
But by cause ye have herd the life of one hermyte. I will that ye here the
life of an other.

How a lioness ete out of the hand of an holy man / like as she had be tame
/ beginning in latin. Ego vbi. Caplm.vi.
Incontinent after yt we were come in to ye first party of deserte with a man
yt knew the places we went at foot of a montayne there where we found an
holy man which had a pytte / which thing was not much found in that country.
Also he had an ox which with a whele drew ye water out of ye pytte which
was right deep. Also he had a gardyn full of cooles which was against the
nature of deserte / where for the ardeur and hete of the son might nothing
grow ne fructefye / but by the labor of this holy man / which aroused often
and watered the ground / that it becam fertyle in such wise that coules and
other herbs fructefyed. And of these coules lived this hermyte and his ox /
the which hermyte gaaf to us plente right Ioyously. Then after souper he
brought us under a palm of the which he lived otherwhyle. And there be none
other herbs in thermytages but such palms whereof ben nourysshed the holy
hermytes and they that been solytary When we came to the place of the said palm
we found a lion / the which made us sore aghaste / but the said solytary man
without dread approached to ye said be / and made him to recuyelle and go a
back a little far. After he gadred with his hondes of ye fruit of this palm
and gaaf to the same lion / which took it of his hand much swetely as it had been a be domestyke and tame / and when he had eten / he went his way. By
which we may well know that the virtue and power of god habou^ded in the said
hermyte being solytary.

How an holy man nourysshed a wulfe the which demanded of hy^ pardon
beginning in latin. Alium eque. Capitulum.vij.
AFter we saw an holy man which dwelled in a little house in which might but
one man come in / with which man was a wulfe accustomed to come whiles that he
souped / and faylled never at hour of souper / and abode always at door
unto the time that the holy man gaaf him some bread which was at soupor / and
when he had taken bread of the hand of the holy man / he bowed to him first
and then went his way. It happed on a time that this holy man went with an
other / and came not again till it was night. This wulfe came as he had be
accustomed at hour of souper and found him not / and therefore he entered
within the house of the holy man / and took ye bread that was in his paner and
ete it. After thynkyng that he had done evil / and went his way Incontinent.
Thermyte came home and found his paner broken and one of his loves lost / and
wist not who had taken it away / but for as much as ye day following this
wulf came not like as he had be accustomed / he doubted some what yt he had done
this theft. Nevertheless by cause he was sorry for his absence / he prayed to
god yt he would send to hy^ this wulf for to comfort him / which was
accords to hy^. And the.vij. day after the wulfe came again at hour of
souper / but for shame and dread he durst not approach / and fro far he fylle
down to the ground and by signs he demanded pardon of his trespass. The
which thing seeing ye holy hermyte made hy^ come ner and pardo^ned hy^ gyuyng
to hy^ double pytau^ce of bread / and thus he took away his heaviness and came
always as he had be customed. Here may we see the power of god which makes ye
cruel best to be meke and tame as lo^bes / wherefore ye people ought well to
dread our lord Ihesu christ when they see yt the bes^ dread him. And to the end
that noman doubt of this that said is. I shall say to you things more
meruayllous with out any thing to feign / but oonly I shall say that I have
seen.

How five little lions being blind were enlumyned by an holy man beginning in
latin. Habitabant. Capitulum.viij.
MAny holy men dwelleden in deserte without any houses / and to the end that
none should vysyte them they abode never in one place because they loved above
all thing to live solytaryly. On a time it happed that two monks of Nytrye
camen for to vysyte an holy fader that lived solytaryly / the which had be of
their convent. And when they had sought him by long space of time. Fynably in
the month of Iuyn they came to the end of the deserte named Memphis. And he had
dwelled there by the space of.xij. year / the which how well yt he fled the
company and comynycacyon of all other men / always when he knew yt they were
of the relygyon of which he had be a relygyous man / he abode they^ and was
with them by the space of three days / the fourth day he brought they^ within
the same deserte / to the which we followed. And anon came a lioness
meruayllously great / the which fylle down at the fete of this holy solytarye
men. And as she had chosen hy^ among the other made sign to him that he
should follow her which thing this holy man did till yt the said lioness came
to her cave / and after she entered in and brought to him five little lions yt
which were blind of nature / and she leyed them at the feet of this holy man
solytarye / the which knew well what she desired. And he made his prayer to
god / and after touched the eyes of those five little lions / and incontinent
they saw. And this done / the two relygyous monks which were come thither for
to see this holy man / returned in to their monasterye praysyng and magnefyeng
god and his saints.

How a brother by a storke knew what herbs he should ete / and which not /
beginning in latin. Fuit et alius. Capitulum.ix.
IN that deserte was an hermyte new comen because that he knew not ye herbs
was strongely tourmented. For often he ete of the herbs that were venomous when
he supposed to have eten good. And thus for this cause he was.vij. days
without to ete / but god seeing his afflyccyon sent to him a storke the which
brought to him a great fardell of herbs / and them that were good and holsom
to ete / the same storke chase them out and leyed them a part / to the end
that he should after know them. And yt so done / he flewhe away / and thus
this brother knew what he should ete / and which he should leave.

Of a brother dwelling in the montayne of Syna the which spacke to no person
by the space of fyfty year / beginning. Sed longu^. Caplm.x.
Know ye my friends that it should be to me a much hard thing to recou^te to
you all the fayttes and deeds of holy men dwelling in deserte with the which I
have conuersed a year and.vij. months. And among all other I have frequented
with him yt had the ox / of whom I have spoken tofore in the.vi. chapter of
this third part. I have also frequented two other monasteryes of saint
Anthonye in which yet at this present time dwell some of his dyscyples. In
like wise I have been in ye place where ye first hermyte saint Poul dwelled. I
have seen ye montayn of Synay. ye heyght whereof approucheth so nygh heaven / yt
it seems yt it touches it / it is so high yt from byneth may not be seen the
highest thereof / and noman living may go up to the highest of it. Between ye
sides of this montayn was said yt there dwelled an holy hermyte which I might
not see / how well yt much dylygently I had sought him / the which had seen
no person in fyfty year / and he had no garment / but used his here instead
of a robe / and when he might espy ye any man sought him he fled in to the
deserte because he would not be seen. It was said that sith the space of five
year in the time that I was in that place / he had spoken oonly with an holy
man / which had asked of him why he fled so the presence of men. Then the
solytary man said to him / that he that frequenteth men / may not be
accompanied ne frequented of angellys / and for this cause it is said that he
was vysyted often of angellys. Then I departed from the montayne of Synay and
came to the flood or river of Nyle where as were diverse monasteryes as I have
said tofore / in which the relygyous men ben holy and Just / and not less
than they yt ben solytary. For among the other virtues that they have they be
much obeyssau^t. And there is none received / but if he have be proved a fore
in such manner / as he may endure all pains and labors / that shall be leyde
to him.

Here follow the great miracles of obeyssaunce / and begins in latin.
Referam etc. Caplm.xi.
I Will recounte to you two great miracles of the virtue of obeyssaunce / of
which that one is this. A seculer man came on a time to a monasterye for to be
relygyous / and prayed thabbot that he would receive him. Thabbot for to preue
him proposed and showed to him the pains and torments of relygyon / as the
dyscyplynes much sharp / and the dyffycyle commandments of the same abbot
/ to ye which eueryche relygyous ought to obey / gyuyng hy^ to understand yt
he might not keep ne accomplysshe them / and for this cause he persuaded him
to goo to an other relygyon that was not so rygorous / saying to him yt it were
better for him yt he went / than to entrepryse so poysau^t and weyghty charges
that he might not here ne endure. But ye same seculer man strongely affected to
be received began to promise that he should obey to all thing that he would
command him / in such wise that if he commanded that he should enter in to
the fire / he should do it Ioyously with out to make any refuse / and so anon
he was received. A little while after his abbot for to prove him / commanded
him that be should enter in to the oven all hoot. And without any dylaco^n he
entered in to the myddle of the fla^me. But by ye virtue of his obeyssau^ce /
the oven which was hoot / was made to hy^ such / like as ye fornays was made
to the three childern of thebrewes. Ananias. Azarias. and Mysaell. And the
fla^me went incontinent out of ye oven / and the brother ye was entered in
found himself as he had be in a place full of dew / whereof thabbot was
much abashed. By the which ensample we ought to know / how the virtue of
obedyence is agreeable to our lord god.

Here follows the second miracle of obedyence / beginning in latin. Quida^
frater etc. Caplm.xij.
AN other brother which was in the same monastery / thabbot charged him for to
see his pacyence that he should watre a rod all dry unto ye time yt it wexed
grene / the which thing was against nature. The same brother took this charge
in pacyence / and every day upon his sholdres went to the river of Nyle
which was much far and dystau^t from thabbaye brought ye water for to watre
or arouse this rod. And not oonly during one year but unto the third year /
in such wise yt fynably it flourysshed. And I my self have seen the little
tree which is yet all grene in the said monasterye gyuyng wytnes how much
auaylleth the virtue of obedyence.

Of him yt chaced the deuylles out of the bodies of men / whereof he was after
ouercomen and fynably purged beginning. Quida^ aute^. Caplm.xiij.
AN holy man had power to cast out deuylles of the bodies of seek men dooyng
Infenyte miracles. For he heled not only when he was present / but also when
he was absente. And if the seek man touched the he^me of his robe / he was made
all hole / or when he sent a lettre to a pacyent he was in like wise heled.
For which cause many of diverse contrees camen to him for to receive health and
guaryson in so great multitude yt many oftymes abode tofore the door abydyng
him. This holy man drank never wyn ne water / and ete nothing saufe vij.
fygges on a day. By succession of time he began to exalte hy^self for these
miracles which he did. But how well that he enforced him to withstand this
vanyte / nevertheless he could not. The deuylles of hell over all enhaunced and
exalted his name / he might not withstand the people that came to him in so
great habundaunce / and was sorry and angry of that he guarysshed and heled
other / and he might not guarysshe his evil thought of vain glory / the
which thus tormented him / wherefore he prayde and made request to our lord
god that he might be as well possessed of the fend of hell / as they that he
guarysshed. The which thing happed to him / and was bound by the feet and by
the hondes / as men do a demonyake / enduryng in him self by ye space of five
months all the tourmentes and euylles that the other suffered and endured
which ben seek of the same maladye. And after when he was purged and made
clean of the said tourment in which he was / and of the vanyte / for the
which he had prayed god and made request for to be possessed of a wicked
spyryte as a fore is said.

Of an hermyte desyryng to return to the world was punysshed / beginning in
latin. Adolesce^s. Caplm.xiiij
IN Egypt was a young man much rich which had a wife and a little child.
And he received of saint Johan thermyte a much good doctrine / by the which
he exhorted him that he should renounce the world. The which fixynge in his
heart this doctrine / despised the world and his rychesses and entered in to an
hermytage / and was in a little time right parfyght in all virtues / in
fastings / in humylyte souerayn / in faith and believe ferme and constau^t / in
such wise yt he was thus as parfyght in the virtues as the other monks. This
seeing the fend he put in his courage that it were better for him to return
in to his contree and vysyte his sone and his wife / than to dwell out of the
world in that pain and solycytude. And thus by this temptaco^n after yt he
had be relygyous by the space of.iiij. year / he left his celle and his good
purpose / and went for to ask counseyll of the brethern of a monasterye nygh
by him. The which cou^seylled him that he should abide. Nevertheless this
purpose could not be taken from him / and thus being obstynat in his purpose
departed fro the said hermytage and concluded to return again to the world.
But as soon as he was out of the said monasterye the devil entered in to his
body. And incontinent he began to scume as a mad man and enraged and
demonyake / bytyng his members with his own tethe and throwyng them on the
ground. The which thing seeing the brethern and knowing brought him again to
their monastery / but they bound him both hands and feet / for otherwise
could they not cheuysshe with him. And he had this pain and this trauayll by
the space of two year hole / for as much as he had wylled to renounce his
hermytage But after two year passed by the good prayers and devout orysons of
holy men he was all hole and guarysshed / and sith returned in to his said
hermytage / and corrected himself / in gyuyng to other example of good life.

Here follows the manner of thabyte and vestement of the relygyous Egypcyens /
beginning in lathn Sunt preterea etc. Caplm.xv.
There be some vestymentis among the gypcyens the which ben more for to
observe the form of the rule than for to keep the body. First they were
coules day and night / to the end that by the same they show their humylyte
and symplesse. Furthermore the Relygyouses of the same place / have cut
shertys of lynnen clothe unto the bottokes and no ferther / to the end that
thereby they show that they have cut of and left all the operacyons of this
world. After they have a little mantell that covers oonly their neck and
their sholdres / which is called maforte in our langage / and to theyrs also.
That other abyllement is skyn of a ghoot yt is called mellote / the which
habyte sygnefyeth yt all vices ought to be mortefyed in them / and yt they
ought to be soueraynly virtuous They never have shoes / but if it be a little
in winter when it is cold vehemently / or when they be seek / or when it is
over hoot / as at none / in which hour ye ground is so chauffed yt it
brenneth ye touches it. And how well that their rule holds not in / yet
nevertheless when they come to do the dyuyne service / they take of always their
shoes thynkyng on that which was said to Moses / do of thy shoes / for the
place which thou stand on / is holy earth and sacred to god.

Of the manner reguler to pray god among the same brethern. And how they have
renou^ced the world beginning in latin. Itaque. Caplm.xvi.
THorugh all Egypt and thorugh all Thebayda where as there be monasteryes of
Relygyous brethern they have a manner and facyon reguler for to pray god as
well on euenyng as on morning. And it byhoueth yt they have partyghtly
renou^ced the world. For a brother shall never be received / if he have not
first renounced all the goods of ye world. And they ye render them in to the
relygyon / what someuer age they be of / ben constrained to obey in such wise
yt they become meke and humble as little childern / and they ought not to
think on their age the which they have lost as to ye world in evil living /
but they must be subgettes to the least. Thus in all Egypt as well in the
service of the day as of the night / the relygyouses syngen.xij. psalms / and
after the.xij. psalms.ij. lessons / one of the new testament / and that other
of the old / the which usage they keep all Indyfferently. For as much as it
has not be ordained of men as the other vsages / but it has be Instytuted and
establysshed by the angellys / which have appeared unto the old faders.

Here follows the place in which the holy faders saw an angel sing xij.
psalms / begy^nyng in latin. Iam cu^ etc. Caplm.xvij.
IN the beginning of the faith were but few christian men how well that they
that were christian were well Just and good / the which had had and taken their
rule and manner of living of the successors of thappostles of our savior Ihesu
christ / and separated them fro the world and went in to the deserte in
places solytaryes / and to the end yt they should show to their successors the
manner of their service / they came on a time all to gydre for to ordeyne and
dyspose their said service to the end that none should be deceived. For to fore
this Instytuco^n every man served god after his devotion / and had none usage
determined. Then they came all to gydre for to make this Instytucyon. And some
of them ordained that there should be said fyfty psalms. Other Instytuted.lx.
psalms / and some other said yt it was not enough / and thus they might not
accord togydre. And they abode there long / till a certain day at hour of
euensonge there was an angel in the form of a relygyous man / the which
aroos and began a psalm and sange.xij. psalms and at end of each psalm he
said alleluya. And when he had done he departed incontinent fro their presence.
And by that was determined the said questyon. For the holy faders knew that it
was an angel. And thefore they ordained through all their Relygyons the nombre
of.xij. psalms / to be kept perpetuelly in their service / as well by day as
by night. And they keep yet now the manner and form of these orysons. And when
their psalm is achyeued and ended / they begin not hastily that other / but
they Inclyne them down to the ground in prayeng to god. And after they arise
in contemplaco^n But they say that when they be said on their couche / the
devil tempts them to sleep / as it has be seen by experyence / that some
for to rest them more than for to pray lie down on the ground / and long
abide there.

What dyscrecyon and nature ought to be kept in oryson and prayer / begynny^g
in latin. Cu^ igitur. Caplm xviij.
THe brethern aforsayd when they come to service they be as peasyble / that
there shall be herd nothing / but the voys of him that psalmodyeth / to the end
to keep the better and lyghtlyer scylence. And they sleep not / but entende
dylygently to their prayers and orysons. And they be short enough in their
prayers / to the end that they be not let by spyttyng rechyng or coughyng.
And their common saying is / that a short prayer perceth the heuens / and there
should we as all achaffed put out and tere with our teeth the fend the which
ennoyeth us always / pryncypally when he sees us making prayers to god against
him. For ye which cause these brethern say that it byhoueth to be short and
bryef in their prayers. And more auaylle.x. verses of a psalm well said or
songen with good affection / than to say as many psalms without any devotion
and it is truth.

Of their handy work / and wherefore pryme / tyerce / sexte / none / and the
other hours ben songen in the church beginning. Ita namque. Caplm.xix.
THese brethern ben so dylygent to their bodily work after their service done
/ that they leave not to think on god. How well that they work with their
hondes. And at tyrce / sexte / and none they say but three psalms oonly in
following Danyell the prophet / the which was three times in the cenacle and
prayed god devoutly. Furthermore these psalms they say not without cause at
this hour there. For the promesses made to thauncyent and old faders have be
sent in some of these hours. First the holy ghoost was sent on withsondaye
upon the appostles at the hour of tyerce / and gaaf to them to speak all manner
of langages. At the hour of serte our savior and redemer Ihesus for the
redempcyon of mankind would be nailed and crucefyed on the cross In the same
hour was sent a vessel to saint Pyeter / in which was contained the
puryfycaco^n of all them that live / and was sent by four begynnynges of
heaven. And by this vessel we understand the gospel. At the hour of none god
rendered his spyryte on ye cross / and in the same hour he descended to hell
for to take out the souls that were therein / and enlumyned with his clerenes
the derkenes of the said hell / and restored to his ancient Royalme that is
paradyse. In this same hour Cornelius knew that his prayer was accepted to
god. Then it appears that the appostles have not Instytuted without cause
these hours here in the church / and that we ought well to ensyewe and follow
them to the end that in the same hours we may praise and honor god / and to
serve him devoutly.

How in a monastery ought to be received a seculer that will enter in to
relygyon / beginning in lytyn. Cum igitur. Caplm.xx.
IF a man will be received in to one of the said monasteryes tofore that he
shall be received he shall lie.x. days hole tofore the yate of the monastery /
to the end that by that moyen may be preued his perseueraunce / his humylyte /
and obeyssau^ce. And he must knele down on his knees to fore the feet of the
brethern that passes forth by ye same yate. But for the better to preue him /
each ought to refuse him and reiecte in saying / that it is by necessyte that
he comes for to be a relygyous / and nothing for devotion. Furthermore ought
to be done to him all Iniuryes and repreues that may be do / to the end that it
may be known what pacyence he shall have when he shall be monk. After yt it
is seen that he be pacyent / he shall be received in defendyng him that he
bring with him neither gold ne silver. And thus he is made naked of all that
he possedeth in such wise that his robe which he had shall not abide with him
/ but openly to fore all his brethern by the hands he shall be despoylled /
and shall be new cladde with the Robes of relygyon / to the end that he
remember that he has renounced the world and his temporell goods / and that
he has chosen the very pouerte of Ihesu christ. And they keep his first
clothes unto the time of his professyon / the which done they be given to the
poor and Indygent / but if so be that he will not abide / his first clothyng
is rendered to him again / and put out with the other. Furthermore when a
Relygyous is thus received and cladde / he is not incontinent put among the
other brethern / but he is delivered to be taught to some holy fader / which
has the charge to receive the pylgryms and the poor people to whom shall
serve this same new brother. For it is the beginning of humylyte to serve the
poor people and pylgryms. After when his humylyte is seen / he shall be
suffered to goo with the other brethern. In this faytte he is learned to be
master of his will / and to surmounte and overcome it. And to that end he is
often commanded to do things which ben against his said will. For the holy
faders say that if a monk mortefye not his affection / he ne may eschew /
heaviness / Ire / ne fornycaco^n / ne also have peace with his brethern / ne may
not be parfyghtly humble. And therefore each Relygyous man ought to mortefye his
will.

How a monk to the end that he do not his own will / ought not to do any
thing without the commandment of his spyrytuall fader / beginning in latin.
Post hec. Caplm.xxi.
IN the foresaid monasteryes the relygyouses ben much obedyent / in such wise
that they do nothing without the commandment of theeyr abbot. And they hem
self go not to the places which ben naturelly required without demaundyng
license. And all that is commanded to them they accomplysshe like as if god
had commanded them / in so much that by their obedyence they do things /
as it were Impossyble to do. And when they be leyde on their couche / if they
here that they be called / they arise and ne and run lightly for to wit what
they should do / in such wise as by adventure / they wrote / and had begone
a lettre / they would not achyeue it for dread that they should abide over
long after that they were called.

Of a monk the sone of an Earl / the which by the commandment of his abbot
bare for to selle openly panyers and hottys / beginning in latin. Nouunus.
Caplm.xxij.
I Knew a brother which was of great parentis the sone of an Earl right rich
and puyssau^t the which brother left fader and mother and went and rendered
him self to be a monk. Thabbot then of the said monastery for to ser his
pacyence commanded him that he should go for to selle in the market.x. panyers
or hottys great / which were of no necessyte for to be sold / and he
delivered him by this condyco^n / that he should not selle them all to one man
/ to the end yt he should be the longer there / but yt he should selle one to
one person / and an other to an other. This brother then which was the sone
of an Earl took the said hottys for to bear through ye market / in such wise yt
he sold they^ acordyng to his charge / and brought the money to his abbot.

Of thabbot Pinuphus / beginning Vidunus. Caplm.xxiij.
WE have seen furthermore one named Pinuphus / which was of a great monastery
in Egypt / and the which was of every man honored and praised. But dredyng
that he should be proud. In an euentyde he fleddde and left the habyte of a
monk / and took thabyte of a seculer / and went to the monastery of
Tabenesyens / yt which was more strayter than other monasteryes. And thus
hopyng never to be known for ye great dystau^ce of ye place / came and was
long at gate attendyng and knelyng tofore at feet of the brethern /
requyryng yt he might be received in to their monastery / then after he had
be preued in his pacyence he was received / but for as much as them seemed he
was not prouffytable / they delivered to him yt charge to labor in the gardyns
/ in which he wrought under an other brother younger than he was / and all yt ye
other refused he did dylygently. On the night in like wise he aroos and
labored secretly / in such wise on ye morn noman knew who has spedde so
their work. So it happed yt the third year thus as his brethren sought him
in diverse places and co^trees / yt he was fou^den of one of them the which
one of them uneath knew him / withstondyng the mutaco^n and chau^gyng of his
habyte / and that he labored in works to him not couenable. For he grubbed in
therthe and planted herbs and cooles / and after fette dounge / and leyde it
about the rotes. This seeing the brother that sought him doubtyng yet whether
it were he or not / approached him more ner and spoke to him. And then he
knew him by the vysage and by his speech yt he was his abbot which he sought
/ and anon fylle down to his feet. This seeing the brethern of that abbaye
demanded of that other why he kneled down to ye feet of that relygyous /
which was but as new comen. Then the brother answered that it was his
abbot. And incontinent eueryche of ye brethern asked him pardon of thyniuryes
and great euylles yt they had down to him. But this holy abbot began to weep
and plain of thenuye of the devil that had bewrayed him / and had not
suffered that he had endured long that pain / to the end yt he should not
have so great reward in heaven. Then the brethern brought him again in to his
abbaye / and kept him that fro thens forthon he should not flee away. But
after he had been there a little time / by great humylyte he departed by night
and went in to a far Regyons. And put him self in to a ship / by the
help of which / he went in to the Regyon of Palestyne / wenyng yt never he
should be founden / for there was never herd speak of him. As soon as he was
arrived he went strayt to a monasterye / which is nygh to the place in which
our savior Ihesu christ was born of the blessed virgyne Marye / and there he
was a while. But like as the Cite which was upon a montayne might not be hid
/ right so this holy man was not long there / but was known by some of the
monks that came on pilgrimage unto the holy land / and brought him again with
great prayers and requests in to his first monasterye.

A right good admonycyon for annouyce beginning in latin. Habent igitur.
Caplm.xxiiij.
ON a time thus as we were with this holy man by cause of the famylyaryte that
was between us / came a brother that demanded to be received in to the said
monasterye / to whom this holy man gaaf a terryble admonyco^n / the which I
will here declare / first he said to him. My friend I trow thou know well
how many days you have abyden at the yate for to be here received / and yet
with great pain have thou be received Now thou ought to know the life of
relygyon in to the which thou wylt enter. For if thou live well / thou shall
win heaven. Also if thou lyuest evil thou shall win hell. So ought
thou to know that to them that serve well and truly to god in their vocacyon
is promised heaven / but to them that be neclygent to serve him / ben promised
torments Infenyte in time to come. And after his vocacyon every man ought to
do and work. For better it were to make none auowe ne promysse / than to make
it and keep it not And furthermore he is cursed and unhappy that does the
operacyon of god neclygently. And therefore said the said holy abbot to the same
brother. Thou have be long refused of us / not but that we desire the health
of every catholyke or christian person / but doubting that we receive them
solyly. And by this wise we ought be repreued of folly / and thou strongly
punysshed and grievously / if thou had be received incontinent without to
have given to the knowleche of the burden and charge of relygyon / and
sholdest have be in danger that the end should not have be good / know you lyth
thou art this day deed to the world and to his goods. And with that as says
thappostle thou art crucefyed to the world and the world in the. But thou
may demand / how may he that is yet living be deed and crucefyed to
world. Now herkene a little. I say first that the cross of which I speak /
is the dread of god. For like as a man crucefyed / may not moeue his members at
his will All in like wise we ought to do nothing to our pleasaunce / but after
that is commanded us. And all in like wise as he that is crucefyed or hanged
thinks no more on worldely things ne to his affeccyons and pleasaunces / and
has no couetyse to possede ne have any things. And when he is nygh the point
of death / he reputeth him self as deed. All in like wise byhoueth us to be
crucefyed by the dread of god / without to think on the world / but we ought
to set contynuelly our thought there / where we hope ones to go to / yt is in
to heaven / if we deserve it. And therefore it byhoueth to eschew that we look
not bacwarde ne behind us / that is to say / when one has renou^ced the
world and have left it behind him / he may no more think thereon in any
manner. For oonly he shall be saved yt shall have perseuered in good and
virtuous operaco^ns unto the end. Furthermore our enemy the fend awayteth
always / and desires nothing but to begyle and deceive us by his cauteles and
malyces. And therefore it shall but little prouffyte to have well begone / that
perseuereth not to the end. And in this wise said the holy abbot to the said
broter. I exhort the sith that thou wylt serve god / that thou have
contynuelly the dread to fore the eyes of thy thought / and that ye apparaylle
thy soul / nothing to the rest ne to the worldly delyces and flesshely / but
to resyste the temptacyons of the devil / and tendure the anguysshes of the
world pacyently. For it byhoueth by many trybulaco^ns to enter in to ye
royalme of heaven / whereof the yate and way ben so strayte / that few people
walk therein / whereof is great pity. Thus then the beginning of our health is
the dread of god. For by dyuyne dread / good conuersacyon / and keeping of
virtues it is gotten. The which dread if it be parfyghtly in the heart of a man
/ it engenders in him virtues / and makes to despise all vain things and
vnprouffytable to his health / and makes him despise and abhor the world.
And by mesprysyng of temporal goods / very humylyte is gotten. The which
humylyte is approved by this manners. The first if a brother Relygyous have all
his will / mortefyed and adnychylate. The second if he show to his souerayn
all his evil thoughts. The third if he do nothing but at the will of his
abbot. The fourth if he keep in all things very obedyence. The fyfth that he
do no wrong to any person / and if any be done to him / that he endure it
pacyently. The.vi. that he do nothing against his rule. The.vij. that he repute
himself in vtyle and unworthy to do that he is commanded / how well that he do
it gladly. The.viij. that he repute himself less in virtue than all other
The.ix. if he be peasyble / and that he speak none evil of his neighbor.
The.x. whereby is known very humylyte in a man / that is if he be not
habou^dant in lawhynges dysordynate And by all these manners above said very
humylyte is knowon. And furthermore after thappostle. It is necessary to the
that is with the other brethern / that you be as a deef man when evil is spoken
of the or of thy neighbor without heryng it / and as a dombe man in keeping the
from spekyng evil of other. Also it byhoueth the that thou do Indyfferently all
that shall be charged to the / and thus shall thy pacyence be more great and
more merytoryous than it should be if thou sholdest be persecuted of other /
and if thou had not but the temptaco^ns of the fend symply / the which
thou suffredest pacyently. Then the beginning of our health is the dread of
god / for of the dread of god comes compuncco^n of heart. And of compuncco^n
comes and proceeds despysyng of all worldly things. Of this despysyng comes
humylyte. Of humylyte proceeds mortyfyfycaco^n / and anullement of his propre
will. Of the mortefyeng of his will. ben eschewed all vices. The vices taken
away / then ensyewen the virtues which grown and fructefye. Of
chaugmentacyon of virtues follows clennes and purete of heart and of
conscience. Of purete of heart follows possessyon of very and parfyght
charity. And of pure charity follows the Royalme of heaven.

Of a monk that made the pilgrims to ete to fore the hour accustomed when men
fast / beginning in latin. Cu^ de sirie partibus. Caplm.xxv.
Then thus as we went fro Syrye in to Egypt / an holy man received us right
swetly the which made ready for us to ete and drink to fore the hour
determined to them that fast. Then we demanded him wherefore he made us to
dyne to fore the hour accustomed. And he answered to us. My friends ye be not
always with me / but fasting abides always here / and so I may always recover
to fast / but not you / and therefore whiles yt ye be here. I will well that ye
ete with me. For I shall well mow after recover my fasting.

Of a monk which never ete allone / beginning in latin. Vidimus et aliu^ in
solitudine. Caplm.xxvi.
SEmblably we have seen an other brother / which never would ete allone / but
always would be accpo^anyed. And if by adventure none came not to vysyte him /
he dyfferred to ete till yt they came / and if they came not he would abide till
the sunday / and came to the church / and the first pilgrim that he found /
he led him unto his celle / and ete with him.

Of a devout relygyous named Machetes / beginning in latin. Vidimus et aliu^
senem. Caplm.xxvij.
AFter this we have known an other holy man named Machetes / to whom god had
given this grace that if he had one day and one night to here the service of
god he would never have slepte. His fader sent to him often of his tidings /
so did his mother and his other kynnesmen / wherefore on a time / be took all
his lettres in his tweyne hondes / and began to say. The lecture of thus many
lettres shall give to me vain Joy or heaviness / which shall serve me of no
thing / as touching to the merit and health of my soul. I know well that I
shall be let in doing contemplacyon / for to take heed and think on them
that have sent them to to me. And therefore I shall conclude that these lettres
shall never be opened ne read / and so he threw them in the fire in saying.
Goo ye with the thoughtys of my contrees / and brenne with these lettres / to
the end that ye bring me not to that which I have ones renounced.

Of thabbot Theodore / beginning Vidimus et aliu^ abbate^. Caplm.xxviij
AFter this we saw an holy fader named Theodore / the which was a great
clerk and much prudent / as well in manner of his living as in holy scripture
/ the which he knew more by the grace of god than by estudye neither by
experyence. One on a time for to know the solucyon of a questyon much hard
and dyffycyle / he was.vij. days in orysons and prayers unto the time that by
reuelacyon dyuyne ye same questyon was to him determined.

Of an holy hermyte in a meruayllous deserte / beginning in latin. Itaque etc.
Caplm.xxix.
IN coming then fro Palestyne to a castle of Egypt called Diulcus / we
found an other order of Relygyouses and more excellent than the other / of
which order the brethern be called Anachorytes more holy and Just than the
other. For first every day they have bataylle ayenste the fend / but for the
better to surmounte him / they goo in to the deppest of the deserte. We found
then some of these relygyouses in a place between the flode of Nyle and the sea / the which place was secret and separate from all people / because that
the land was Inhabytable for the sterylyte and baraynes thereof / as well
because of ye see / which is salt and bitter / as for ye land which might
bear no fruit / we being comen to them were greatly admeruaylled / of the great
pains and labors that they endured in this hermytage. For first they have so
great lack of water for to drink / that they be constrained for to depart it
among them / like as men should depart right good wyn. For they must goo
fetch the said well water at the said river of Nyle / which is three mile
far fro the hermytage. And yet between the river and their dwelling ben there
great montaynes full of Roches / by which the ways ben ye more paynefull.
After that we had seen these things. An holy hermyte among them led us
in to his celle / saying if that we would abide there / that he would give to
us the said celle for he would depart / and to the end yt we should believe him
the better / he said he would have left it though we had not comen thither /
wherefore we took it / and he went and made an other with great labor and
dyffyculte. And after by great charity he gaaf it to other pylgryms with all
the vtensylles that were therein. And after he made an other in which he
dwelled.

Of two young childern the which berynng fygges to a seek Relygyous deyed by
the way / and begins in latin. Quida^ etc. Caplm.xxx.
ABbot Johan being in Sychye came to him a brother / which brought to him
fygges / the which afterward sent them by two young childern to an holy man
much seek / the which dwelled in deserte in an hermytage dystaunt fro the
church of the said abbot Johan.xviij. mile or there aboutes. The which
childeren beryng these fygges went toward the said brother that was seek. And
thus as they went they were surprysed with a cloud so thycke that they lost
their way / and so gooyng night and day could not find the celle of the said
hermyte / but were constrained to abide in the way / because they were much
weary and trauaylled / as well for cause of the great ho^gre / as for the great
and terryble thurst that they had suffered. And so they kneled on their knees
in prayeng to our lord. And in so dooyng they rendered and yielded both their
souls up to god. After two or three days / the abbot Johan seeing that these
two young childern that they came not again / he sent for to seche them
through the deserte / and they were followed by the trace of their paas and feet
/ the which were enprynted in the sonde in such a wise that they both were
founden deed knelyng on their knees / and the fygges all hole by them / of
which they would not ete / but they had be more content to suffer the death
corporell / than without the permyssyon of their abbot to ete yt which they
were commanded to bear to the said seek Relygyous brother.

Of the monks of Egypt and of their dylygence / beginning in latin. Per
totu^. Caplm.xxxi.
Through all the regyon of Egypt / the Relygyouses ben never ydell / but win
dylygentely their living with labor and trauaylle of their bodies / and given
for the love of god that which they win above their living / not only to
pylgryms but also to them of lybye yt ben nedy and Indygent / and also to
prisoners / and seek malades of towns and cytees to them neighbors /
estemyng yt by such works they make a pleasant sacrefyce and acceptable to
god. For they say yt a relygyous person / how well yt he do or make some
thing / yet is he always tempted of some devil. But he yt nothing does is
vexed and tempted of Innumerable quantyte of deuylles. Thabbot Paulus much
holy and approved relygyous dwelled in a deserte so barayne yt there ne grew
any thing but palms of which he lived. For he was so far fro men / that
when he had made any thing / he could never selle it / because of the great
dystaunce of the place. And to the end that he should not be ydell / he gadred
every day of the palms and weyed them oftentimes / to the end that he should
not ete more at one time than at an other / and made of the leuys of the palms
little mattes or maundes so many that he filled with all a fosse or dyke. And
at the end of the year / seeing that there came no man for to bye and have his
work / he put fire on them and burnt them. And after the next year
following he made as many for to eschew ydlenes. for he said that it is not
possible that a relygyous person may live Justly / if he be ydell.

Of a brother which was a blasphemer of god / the which by punyco^n dyuyne
was enbraced with lecherye. Capitulum.xxxij.
I Have known an other brother the which was in such wise tempted in the
sin of lecherye / that uneath he might withstand it / wherefore he came to an
holy man to whom he said. Alas fader what ought I to do. I am all burnt with
the fire of lechery. The holy fader answered to him in syghynge. I believe my
child that god has not sent to the this passion so strong and so vehemente
/ if thou had not blasphemed in some wise him or his saints. The poor
Relygyous heryng the holy fader / fylle down to his fete and confessyd him that
he had blasphemed the name of god / and yt he might not have perfecco^n of
virtue in his soul.

Of dyscrecyon the which is mother of all virtues / beginning in latin. Quodam
Caplm.xxxiij.
ON a time camen some holy faders to the abbot Anthonye / demau^dyng of him
counsel and Instrucco^n for to live salutaryly / then he made to them a
collaco^n yt which endured from even till on ye morn in the morning / and
after that he made a questyon the which endured to mydnyght following. And this
was ye questyon / which virtue among all the other preserves most the
relygyous persons fro the grynnes and laas of the devil / and brings one in
to felycyte eteternall. To this questyon eueryche of them answered after his
capacyte and understanding. And some sayden / yt the Relygyous person was
delivered fro the devil by fastings / by wakynges / and other virtues. The
other sayden that never the devil shall be surmou^ted of a brother / but by
very pouerte of speryte. The other sayden that oonly they that were in the
depnesse of deserte might surmou^te the devil of hell / so that they have
parfyght love and charity to god. The other affermeden yt they that receyueden
the pylgryms / and done to them due service might lyghtely overcome the fend.
Thus were these brethern in co^trauersye upon this matter / and therefore the
said abbot said to them. My brethern this that ye have said is well necessary
to them that will follow god by very relygyon / but this is over little for to
be delyuerd fro the puyssau^ce of the fend. For we have seen some of our
brethern living Justly in the thyckest of deserte which in the end have
fallen / and has be cause of their ruin fault of dyscrecyon / the which
they had not in their operacyons. And always it is right necessary to a
relygyous person / because that it shows always the ryall way to paradyse /
and it keeps that one be not over much / ne over little contynent in his
works / and it is manyfeste that without dyscrecyon may be had no virtue.
And these words said / the said brethern were all of that opinion / that
dyscrecyon is she that may deliver the Relygyous persons fro the grynne of the
devil / and to conduyte and led to the glory of heaven / as she which is
mother and conseruatryce of other virtues.

Of Heron an ancient fader Capitulum.xxxiiij.
ANd to the end that I show to you how dyscreco^n is requysyte and necessary. I
shall recounte to you an example of an ancient fader named Heron / the which
because he was not dyscrete in his operacyons lost the reward and merit of
them / and deyed myschau^tly / hit is truth yt this said Heron was by the
space of fyfty year in deserts living in so great dyscreco^n as ever any man
lived. But the devil enuyous of his good life tempted him in such wise yt he
sclaundred all the other brethern of thermytage / for he himself entreprysed
to fast co^tynuelly / and went not out of his hermytage / in such wise that
the holy day of paske or ester he came not to ye church with the other
brethren / wherefore they were evil content / and wenyng that he had been seek
brought to him a little pytau^ce / to the end that for the solempnyte of the
day he should ete a little / but he would nothing so do / and proceeded to him
this folly by thynstygaco^n of the devil / which by the suffrau^ce nf god was
appyered to him in lykenes of an angel of heaven / because he had rendered
himself subgette to him / and persuaded this brother that he should cast
hy^self in to a pytte for to preue his great virtue and constau^ce / wherefore
the said old brother trustyng in his own virtue lepe and cast him self in
to ye same pytte The other brethern sechyng after him herd him cry within ye
pytte / and they drew him as he had be deed. And the third day after
obstynate in his error / for none might make him to believe that this thing was
Illusyon dyabolyke.

Of tweyne relygyouses which would not ete / but if god sent to them their
refeccyon / beginning. Quid dicam. Caplm.xxxv.
TWo brethern dwelled beyond thermytage / in which was woned to dwell saint
Anthonye the which would not ete but if god sent to them their refecco^n.
And when they had long walked they were nygh deed for hunger / and they came to
a people that were named the Mazytes / the which people ben much cruel and
murderers. Nevertheless when they saw these brethern / they came to them all
swetly and brought to them bread / for they saw that they were enfamysshed.
The one of them took the bread also agreably as god had sent it to him / and
supposed so / for he said in him self that god had so done / to the end yt the
said Mazytes that were accustomed to slay the people should save his life and
his felawes / the which were nygh deed / and thus yt brother ete it.
Nevertheless that other would not ete thereof / thinking that a man had give to
them yt refecco^n / and not god. Now how well yt they had folysshly bego^ne /
nevertheless that one achyeued wisely / for in the end he knew his fault / and
ete / by which he eschewed the death. But ye other began evil / and achyeued
worse / and therefore he deyed corporally / and might happen eternally.

Of a relygyous which would sacrefye his sone to the devil beginning in
latin. Quid dica^ etc. Caplm.xxxvi.
WHat shall I say of a relygyous the which I shall not name / for as much as
he lives yet / the which was deceived by the devil For oftyme he appeared to
hy^ in form of an angel of heaven. And every night the fend enlumyned his
celle as well as he had had light. On a day then among the other / the
devil admonested him that he should sacrefyce to god a child that he had /
the which dwelled in the monasterye with him / doing him to understand yt in
so dooyng he should be equale to the patryarke Abraham. The which thing he
would have done / if his child by the will of god had not escaped out of his
celle whereby it appyereth that he was not well dyscrete.

Of a Relygyous to whom the devil showed the armee of christian men and of the
sarasyns / beginning. Fuit etc. Caplm.xxxvij.
There was an other Relygyous / the which in all his life lived in over great
rygour of abstynence / and never issued out of his celle. And when he came to
the end of his life / he was in such wise tempted of the fend / yt he which
had surmou^ted tofore all other relygyouses / becam the most meschau^t. For
the devil for to peruerte him show to him oftymes a great company of christian
men / as well relygyouses as seculers black / foull and infecte / and on
thopposyte he showed to him a company of Infydeles shynyng as the son. And
said to hy^ furthermore yt if he would be partycypau^t of ye glory of those
Infydeles / he should do cyrcu^cyse hy^ / the which for this cause / he put
hy^ in this folly to will be cyrcu^cysed / by which every man knew yt he was
deceived / and thereby it appiereth yt it is danger / when there is no
dyscreco^n.

How for to be co^fessyd of his sins it chasseth away the devil more than
other thing beginning in latin. Abbas etc. Caplm.xxxviij.
THabbot serapyon when he would inform and teache his young monks / he
recou^ted to them of his life / when he was young as they were / and said /
when I was young as ye now be I dwelled with thabbot named Thebona / and I had
this custom with me / yt every day when I had dyned I hid in my bosom a
lytyl loof of bread / which I ete and deceived my master And how well yt I
did thus every day always when I had eten it. I repented me and had much
great heaviness of the theft that I had done / that I had no pleasyr when I had
eten the bread / for my conscience said to me well yt I ought not so to do. And
so I was constrained by contryco^n to show it to ye holy man with whom I
dwelled. It happed yt some brethern came to this holy man / and when they had
dyned / he gaaf to they many good doctrynes and enseygneme^t. among which he
said to they yt there was nothing yt rejoiced ye devil so much / as when a
relygyous man showed not his evil thoughts to his ghoostly fader. I then
heryng these words found my self heavy and sore dyspleasau^t / wenyng yt ye
holy man knew my thoughts. And inco^tynent I began to lamente secretly / and
after to syghe and weep so openly yt each of they^ apperceyued it / and
Incontinent I took the loof yt was in my bosom and brought it to hy^ / and came
my self and fill down to the feet of ye holy man and of ye other / in saying
to they^ how every day I stale a loof / askyng of they^ pardon and mercy. And
anon ye holy man said / have you affyau^ce in god my child / for thy
confession shall make yt this day surmou^te thyn enemy / which is ye devil
of hell / upon whom you shall have power by thy confession / which has
empesshed yt by his temptaco^n / and therefore if you wylt / ye devil shall no more
be master over ye / sith yt you confessest thy syn^e / for he is cast out of
thy conscience by this true confession. And uneath had ye holy man achyeued his
words / when a la^pe enlumyned spra^ge out of my bosom / the which filled
the celle with stenche in such wise yt no person might endure. And then
again said the holy man / loo see here how god approves my words / to the
end yt you know vysybly thordure and stenche / the which was in thy heart /
to be thrown and cast out by true and hole co^fessyon / and yt the devil
shall never dwell in thy heart. And by this moyen was taken away fro me the
stenche of the devil of hell / in such wise that never after he tempted me.

IN the parts of Palestyne nygh to a vyllage / where as was borne the prophet
Amos / there was a great hermytage / the which touched the flood of Iordane /
and nygh to ye cite of Sodom. The holy hermytes that dwelled there in seruyng

said holy faders were in such wise received by they^ of Arabye yt each of

Of thabbot Danyell beginning in latin. Inter etc. Caplm.xl.
THabbot Danyell among all other has been always egall in all virtues / but
pryncypally has floured in humylyte / because of ye which and of his softenes
he was Instytuted abbot of ye said place in thoffyce of a deken. And this holy
abbot enjoyed to much of his humylyte / that all they that he knew to hy^
semblable / he enhau^sed they^ to thoffyce sacerdotal. And furthermore ye said
abbot desyryng to have a successor ye were worthy to govern his monastery
Instytuted ye said Danyell to be a priest. The which nevertheless for what
someuer dygnyte yt he had / he left nothing of his former humylyte / but
always how well yt he was priest he excercysed the office of a deken oonly /
reputyng himself unworthy to excercyse the office sacerdotall. But Paphu^ce
which supposed to make hy^ his successor was deceived / for god took hy^
tofore and deyed tofore hy^.

Of thabbot Serenus beginning / Su^me etc. Caplm.xli.
I Have seen sith thabbot Serenus a man right virtuous and syngulerly reno^med
for ye great and excellent virtues yt did shine in him / not oonly in
operaco^n in ward / but also in appearance outward / and ye which also among
the other virtues he had one in especyall which was the virtue of chastyte.
And because yt it is a thing above nature for to be chaste / therefore I will
show how he had this virtue. The same holy man day and night intended to
prayers and orysons / fastings and wakynges. And for to abide vndefouled of
the sin of ye flesh / he prayde our lord so affectuously and so devoutly
yt his prayers were herd. For in one night an angel appyered to hy^ in
slepyng / which took out of his body as a botche all swollen / and after put
it in to his entraylles again like as tofore / and said to him. O Serenus see
here all the lecherye of thy flesh which is taken fro the. And know thou
that this day you haste won the purete and clennes perpetuelly of thy body
the which you have demanded of god. This suffyseth as touching the life of
this said holy man / ye which when we came to him we demanded diverse
questyons / pryncypally of ye temptaco^ns of ye fend But he answered to us all
Ioyously like as he was acustomed / yt the devil of hell had no power upon a
person / but as god gives to hy^ license / as we have example of Job whom ye
devil might not tempte / but as god permytted hy^.

How the deuylles have not so much power now against the monks as they had in
old time beginning in latin. Satis tamen Caplm.xlij.
WE know as much by experyence as by other relaco^n of old faders / yt the
deuylles of hell have not so much power against the monks now in these days
present / as they had against them in time passed For then there dwelled but
few monks in hermytages. And ye deuylles were so terryble for to tempte / and
the people of so little resystence / yt right few abode in thermytages and
other places solytarye. And also in the hermytages where as there were.x.
or.xij. relygyouses / the devil was there so contynuell / that they durst
never sleep togydre but whiles ye some slepte / the other prayed to god. And
after when they that had prayed would sleep / they awoke ye other the which
prayed in like wise / and all for teschewe ye ferocyte and cruelte of the
devil. And therefore now the deuylles ben more let to tempte us for two
causes. The first for the sign of ye cross / That other for we be of less
resystence than ye holy faders were / and therefore the deuylles retche not to
tempte us / For they know well yt they shall win and have us lightly. So
they dayne not to fight against us yt be latchous and ready to fall / as they do
against ye very champyons of our savior Ihesu christ We also have seen and
read / and yet see and read all day that they yt be holy and Just / have
oftymes ben possessed and tempted of the devil of hell / not oonly for their
sins / for they had none / but god suffered it to the end yt they should be
proved as gold in the fornays / and yt at the day of Judgment / they should
go strayte in the glory of heaven / after yt / which is said / that the
ryghtfull and Just is proved in the fornays of very humylyte. And in an other
place it is said. I chastyse them that I love / and this is enough showed in
our time of thabbot Paulus / and of thabbot Moses / the which how well yt
they were rihgt Just and holy / always were they persecuted.

Of thabbot Paul beginning in latin. Hic igitur abbas etc. Caplm.xliij.
THabbot named Paul had the thought so pure and so chaste / that he had never
the will to see not oonly the vysage of a woman / but also the abylleme^tes.
For on a day as he went to vysyte an holy fader he was recou^tred of a woman /
but al incontinent as he saw her he returned in to his celle more Impetuously
than if he had be chaced of a lion or a another best. And for as much as he
had the wy^men in over great abhomynacyon nothing by presumpco^n / but by
fervent chastyte / yet god suffered his body to be smyten with ye palsye / in
such wise / that he had no membre of which he might help him self / and not
oonly the feet / but the tongue and the eeres did not in him their office /
for he might not speak nor here / but was as a statue or image vnmeuable. And
for this cause he found noman that might suffyse to him to suffer the maladyes
/ wherefore he was constrained to suffer to be born in to a monastery of women /
there where as ye holy Relygyous wy^men admynystred to him by ye space of.iiij.
year all his necessytees / and after deyed with them. And how well yt he was
thus enfeblysshed in his members / always he had this virtue / that what oil
ye touched his body / guarysshed and heled the seek men / lo yt they were
therewith enoynted. And therefore it is notorye that this maladye was come to him
by ye will of god / the which would manyfeste the Inestymable virtues of the
said holy fader.

Of thbbot Moses beginning Secundus. Caplm.xliiij.
Following the abbot Moses the second how well yt he was Just and an holy man
/ nevertheless because yt he had repreued thabbot Machary of some things / he
was possessed of the devil / in such wise that he took the fylthe and ordure
that came of men / and put it in his mouth. The which punyco^n was sent to him
to the end that he should not fall in to a more grievous sin. For incontinent
as the abbot Machary fill on his knees and prayed humbly to god for ye said
Moses. The devil of hell lept out of his body / and therefore we ought not
to despise them yt ben strongly tempted or demonyake. For we ought believe two
things. First ye none is tempted of the devil without the suffrau^ce of god.
Secondely that all ye which god sends to us / is for our prouffyte and
health. For he knows well that which is necessary to us and prouffytable.

Of a Relygyous which saw by night a multitude of deuylles beginning in
latin. Quida^ ante^ frater etc. Caplm.xlv.
OO relygyous brother walkyng through deserte was constrained by cause he was
surprysed of the night to enter in to a fosse or cave where he began to say
his service after his custom tylle after mydnyght. And after he would have
rested and slept a little. But incontinent as he so would have done he saw
tweyne caterues and companyes of deuylles accompanyeng their prince / that one
company tofore / and that other behind. The which prince was more great and
terryble than the other. After he set him on a chayr / and asked all what
they had done And they yt had not vaynquysshed the men which they had tempted
/ he put them out as meschau^t and foles / but they^ that had begyled and
deceived some / he praised them / and set they^ about the other / to the end
that eueryche of them should do so. Among ye which there came one yt said yt
ye same night / he had made a monk to fall in to fornycaco^n / the which he
had tempted by five year tofore / and at this relaco^n each of they^ enjoyed /
and he was greatly praised of the prince and of the other. And then they went
their way / and after ye spring of the day began to come / in ye which this
brother which doubted whether it had be true or none yt which he had dremed.
And then this holy man came in to a place named Pelusiu^ in which place
dwelled ye same relygyous of whom the devil had auau^ted hy^ to have deceived
by ye said sin of fornycaco^n And there dwelled an other devout relygyous
which knew well the brother yt had herd the said relaco^n / to whom he asked
how yt the other relygyous fared / and found yt he had be deceived as said is.
For he had forsake his monasterye / but afterward when he herd say these
things / he came again in to his said monastery / and with great habundau^ce of
teres made and did holsom penance.

Of two phylosophres which went to saint Anthonye begy^nyng in latin Quoda^
vero tempe etc. Caplm.xlvi.
ON a time two phylosophres heryng ye good reno^mee of saint Anthonye went to
him. And when they were with hy^ because yt he answered not to they^ to their
pleasyr of ye questyons which they proposed to hy^ / returned saying yt he
was a fooll and ygnorau^t. The which phylosophres of envy that they had that
many came to saint Anthonye as servant of god / they sent to hy^ by their art
magyke two deuylles for to tempte hy^ / but ye holy man by his prayer and by
the sign of the cross / kept them so well yt they approached hy^ not.
Then they returned to the two phylosophres without doing to hy^ any thing.
But nevertheless they sent two strenger deuylles which did to hy^ no more
dyspleasyr than the first. Thyrdely they enraged and wood sent to hy^ more
cruel fendes by the half / but they did nothing to hy^ but came again all
confused. For they found saint Anthonye constau^t and steadfast. And for so
much they knew well what virtues ye good christian men have For these deuylles
which were so terryble might not gryeue ne noye saint Anthonye ne his house.
Then these two phylosophres much meruayled came to saint Anthonye / and
confessing their sin did do baptyse they^. After saint Anthonye asked of
them what day they had sent those deuylles to hy^. And by their answer he
knew yt in thoo days he had be sore trauaylled in temptaco^ns / nevertheless
he had resysted them by the moyen of his prayers / in which he was right besy
and contynuell. For on a time thus as he prayde fro ye even tylle on the morn
seeing the son arise and appyere / he began to cry and say. O you son
wherefore let you me / what enforcest ye now for to show thy self / for to
preue and take away fro me the clerenes of this very light / which now
presently I see.

Here fynysshed the third party of this present book.
Here follows the fourth part
Here begins the prologue of saint Paschayse upon the fourth part of the
life of holy faders as well of Egypt as of Greece.
O Venerable lord and fader Martyn priest and abbot. Paschayse. Salute Right
holy and devout fader. If it had be leefful to refuse thy commandment. I had
gladely forborne for to translate the lives of faders out of greek in to latin /
pryncypally for two causes. That one is / that the works and deeds of old
faders ben much great and unknown / wherefore I can not well descryue them ne
write. That other is for I have none entendement ne connyng to do it. And
certainly my rudesse and Imbecyllyte dare not entrepryse such a work ne
operaco^n / but this notwithstanding I trustyng in thy benygnyte and obeyssau^t
to thy commandment without to demand any glory ne exaltaco^n. I shall
begin the work by the commandment. And how well that there be Infenyte
qua^tyte of books right elegantly written in latin. Notwithstanding I have right
few seen as you well know. For there is no person yt knows so well my
science as you / and therefore if by adventure you fyndeste in my translaco^n any
thing less than suffycyently recyted or expressed / blame not me therefore. For
in so doing I have followed as well as I may / how well yt I have not the
faculte for to speak ne to vttre ornately. Therefore please it to the to polysshe
ye langage by thy swetenes the which is more sweet than honey / and I shall not
be dyspleased / if it please to thy magnyfycence to amend that which shall
not be weel and Improperly touched.

Here begins the book of admonycyons / and first against glotonye.
A Monk asked on a time of thabbot Sysoy how he ought to live in his celle. To
whom thabbot answered. Ete thy bread and thy salt / and be not curyous in
arayeng thy mete soumptuously for thy body / but soberly govern yt in thy
celle / with out going in to diverse places to ask alms. The same abbot
said to another which asked hy^ also how he should live. For ye prophet
Danyell said yt he had never be required to ask alms out of his resydence.
yet always he lived Justly. An holy man said to an other / yt he was much
charytable / and yt the lantern lyghteth to many / but not for yt oftymes he
bre^neth it self above An holy fader asked an other such a questyon / yt is
to wit / if a man should be praised always for to ete little / and which of
them yt absteyned them from etyng have most merit or mede. To whom it was
answered as to the first party nay. For there is some people that may not ete
but right lytyl after their complexion. And it is notorye that such ought not
to be praised ne blamed for as ye philosopher says in his ethykes / none ought
to praise ne blame us for tho things which we have of nature. As then it be
so that such folk have this Inclynaco^n of nature / they ought neither be
blamed ne praised / But they yt absteyne them and ete less than their
complexion requires they have great merit / so yt their intenco^n be
ryghtfull and well ruled after the Judgment of reason. As touching the second
party of the questyon / which is to wit among them yt absteyne they^ for
the honor of god / they ben they yt have most merit of god. Answer. They yt
have most of nourysshyng / and absteyne them egally have more mede than the
other / in as much as they withdraw them for ye honor of god pryncypally.
And consequently for the maceraco^n of their bodies the nourysshyng which is
to them necesserye / and for as much as in such caas ought to be seen the
complexion / and not ye quantyte or scarcete of the mete. For to ete in egall
porcyon is sometime outrage to one / and over little to an other. And all men
ought to understand these words / as touching thentenco^n of fasting / is
well right to be ruled after thappetyte of dame reason. A brother came on a time
to ye holy abbot Paul in saying. Fader please it to the of thy charity to say
to me / what thing I ought to gadre in my yougthe yt may socoure me in mine
age. To whom the holy fader answered. Thou shall these whether you wylt have god
of ye money to the end yt you be not poor / as who says Thou may not love
god with all thy heart / and the worldly rychesses togydre. For as it is says
in ye gospel. We may not serve god and ye prince of auaryce. Thus then these
you god / and despise you rychesses of the world / or else chese worldly
rychesses and despise god.

Thabbot Agathon often informed his dyscyple saying to hy^. if thy neighbor
have need of any thing yt you have / thou ought not to deny him / but thou
ought to socoure him. if you wylt keep the commandments of god /
consyderyng yt you art subgette to necessytees corporell as he is. For ye
scripture says In such mesure as you shall have mesured to other. In the same
shall be mesured to the.

How for thendure pouerte causes to come to the rest of heaven.
AN holy fader said that we find in holy scripture that lazar that was at yt
yate of the evil rich man had in him none other virtue / but that he endured
his pouerte right pacyently / and never grutched ne murmured against the rich
man / but praised and thanked god of all / wherefore he was brought in to
paradyse. This holy man says also / that it never behooves to think but of
the dread of god And if by adventure we be constrained to think of our bodies
/ we ought not to think but when it is time / as who would say that we ought
to be always dylygent and besy in the dread of god / but to think on our body
we ought to be besy in time and in place oonly.

Of parfyght pacyence.
THabbot Anthonye prophesied of thabbot Ammonicius in saying to hy^ / you o west
one time to be much pacyent and parfyght in ye dread of god. After he ladde
him out of his celle in showing to him a stone and said to him. Abbot Ammonius
go and do wrong to this stone / and smite and beat it as much as you may.
And so he did. After saint Anthonye asked hy^ what has this stone answered to
the. Thabbot Ammonius said yt it had answered to hy^ nothing. Saint Anthonye
said you owe to be thus pacyent ones in time coming / for you shall have such
and so great pacyence yt what someuer shall be done to the / thou shall wene
and suppose that it is none Iniurye

How and when one ought to do the will of his neighbor. A monk demanded of
thabbot Permenius what is faith. And he answered / that to live always in
charity / and to do well to his neighbor after his power is very faith. For
it is said that faith without works is deed. And thus they that live evil
have none good ne ferme faith. And of his dyffynyco^n it is said that faith is
to believe that which he sees not.

Thabbot Theodore spekyng on a time of thoperaco^ns of the soul / and of
thoperaco^ns of the hands / his brethern sayden to him. Fader say ye to us
what dyfference is there between the works of the soul / and of them of the
hondes. And he said to them / all that which we do for the love of god in
keeping his commandments is called the operaco^ns of ye soul / but ye which
we do for synguler prouffyt is said the work of the hands.

The abbot Appollo when one demau^aed him of his labor / he went forth
Ioyously with eueryche and said. I walk with my king Ihesu christ and go
labor for my soul. And yt to do is a good reward. And by this may one
conclude / that there / where one may edefye his neighbor without offendyng
god / he ought to fulfylle his will always seen in time and place.

How one ought to forsake his will. and specially the Relygyouses.

A brother coming in to Sychye for to see thabbot Arsenius would not tarry for
any prayer that was made to him / saying that he would not ete till that he had
spoken to him. So yt one of the brethern brought him to thabbot Arsenius which
then was in his celle. Anon they began to pray to god and after they satte
down / but he yt brought that other seeing that Arsenius said nothing / said
that he would goo his way. Then said he that was come^ And I also will go /
and so went they both two. Then began the stranger to pray that other
that they should go see thabbot Moses / to the which that other accorded. The
said Moses received them right benygnely. And after they went both tweyne.
And in walkyng said to the stranger he that had brought hy^ thither. Now here
my brother / you have seen these two old faders which you desyredest so much
to see say now / which of them seems to the / the better. The relygyous
answered that he which had received them so benygnely seemed to him to be ye
better The which answer heryng an holy fader / he prayed to god in this manner
/ Lord god please it to ye to show to me which of them has most merit /
either he that for ye love of god fled all the sight of men and their
company or he that for thy name receives all pilgrims. Then were there
showed to him two ships / in yt one of them he saw the holy ghoost peasyble
/ and the abbot Arsensius with him / and in yt other he saw a legyon of
angellys / and with them thabbot Moses / which putted honey in to his mouth
/ by which he knew well yt both two of them hadden good salarye and reward.

How one ought to serve ye seek men.
Much people of diverse regyons came^ to saint Anthonye for to receive health /
among whom there came a monk of Alexandrye named Eulogius / which had be a
scoler yt which desyryng to ensyewe our lord had renou^ced all his goods in
reseruy^ge some porco^n and little qua^tyte / of which he hoped to live in
time coming / but he found hy^self by diverse temptaco^ns in such wise
troubled in his courage yt he might not abide in any monastery wherefore leuyng
his hermytage / he found in his way a man which was seek of a maladye called
elephantyke / by ye which he had not in all his me^bres any health but in his
tongue / by yt which he showed to him his maladye. This seeing eulogius made
his prayer saying lord god in thy name and for ye honor of yt I receive this
man which is persecuted by gryeuous maladye / to the end yt in receyuyng hy^ I
may get ye glory of heaven And therefore my god give to me favor / to the end yt
I may achyeue this work. After he said to the seek man. My brother if ye wylt.
I shall receive yt in to my house / and after my power I shall serve the /
then answered the seek man. Alas sire if it so please yt I would well Then
said Eulogius. I go in to my house for to fetch an ass for to bring ye thither
/ and so he did and served hy^ in all his nechssytees by ye space of.xv. year /
and after by thadmonyco^n of ye devil / ye seek man would have goon away /
and began to grudge and murmr against Eulogius in saying to hy^. Thou art a
man fugytyfe / which have left thy house / and wenest by thoccasyon yt you
seruest me to recover ye health of thy soul. This not withstondyng Eulogius
prayed hy^ yt he would leave to say to hy^ such Iniuryes in saying. My friend
/ if I have offended yt in any thing tell it to me / and I shall amend it.
The seek man answered / go thy way. I set not by thy flateryes / set me in
ye common way out of this deserte. Then said to hy^ Eulogius. I pray ye
appease thy self. The seek man answered. I may no more endure thy derysyons and
mockes / and also I may no longer live in this manner / for I will ete flesh.
And to yt Eulogius was content / he went and fette to him some / and as soon
as ye seek man saw but he began to cry. Thou abbuseste / thou may not
satysfye my will. For I will goo see ye world. Then Eulogius brought to him
a multitude of monks which were fast by / to the end that he might appease him
/ but after yt he had seen them he was more cruel than he was tofore / and
began to say I may not see the / and thou enforcest thy self for to bring to
me a multitude of people that do no thing but devour thy sabstau^ce. And in
so tormentyng him self / and yet said. I will go in to the world / bear me
again thither where as thou tokest me. And he was so troubled in his
entendement / that if he had might he would have hanged him self. Then
Eulogius demanded of the relygyous counseyll what he should do with this seek
man saying that he was in a meruayllous perplexite for his terryble words /
and said. I woto not whether I ought to put him forth / or to keep him with me
To whom the brethern said. Thou shall put this seek man in a ship / and shall
led him to thabbot Anthonye in his monasterye / and thou shall abide there
till he come out of the cave wherein he dwells. And when thou shall see him /
thou shall recount thy pain to him which thou endurest / in demanding of
him counseylle upon this matter / and how that thou shall therein proceed / and
do all that which he shall say to the / for he shall say no thing but
that it proceeds of god. The said Eulogius obeyed to the holy relygyouses. And
by night he bare this seek man unto the Ryuage / and after leyde him in a
ship / and led him to Saint Anthonye. Now had Saint Anthonye a custom /
when his dyscyple came to him for to sygnefye the coming of any people / whether
they were of Egypt / or of Iherusalem. And above this he had or deyned / when
him seemed yt they were devout people / he should answer that they were of
Iherusalem. But and if they were simple and ydeottis / he should say that they
were of Egypt. Then Saint Anthonye demanded his dyscypl^ what people were
come. The dyscyple answered / fader some of them be of Egypt / and the other
be of Iherusalem. Then saint Anthonye made to them good chere / and after
all the night he was with them in prayers and orysons in admonestyng them for
their health. In the which night after that he had called some that he knew /
he called three times Eulogius / but he answered not / wenyng yt he had called
some other so named. Then saint Anthonye said to him answer / for I speak to
the that art come fro Alexandrye. And then after said Eulogius / what wylt
thou that I say. Saint Anthonye said / wherefore art you come hither. Then
Eulogius answered and said / he yt has showed to the my name / shall also well
show to the / the cause of my coming. Saint Anthonye said. I know well
wherefore you art comen / but I will yt thou say it tofore all thy brethern.
Then began Eulogius to say. I found this seek man in the common way
despised of every man / and I have taken him in promysyng to god to socoure hy^
in all his necessytees after my power / to the end that fynably we both two
might be saved / and have been.xv. year togydre like as it has been showed to
you / but for as much sith certain time / he has grieved and molested me by
great Iniuryes. I come unto you to the end yt ye counsel me what I shall do
therein I have some time thought to put him away from me / as well by reason of
the said Iniuryes / as for as much as I can not content hy^. Then answerde
to hy^ saint Anthonye much rudely how have thou dar think to put him fro the.
I assure the / that if you put him out from the / he shall find an other yt
shall better think than thou. By this answer was Eulogius so abashed yt he
wist not what to say. That seeing saint Anthonye began to speak to the seek
man / come hither thou man unworthy of heaven and of the earth / foull and
Infecte / shall thou not cesse to grudge and murmr against the servant of god
/ which for the honor of him has so benyngly the received. After he went to
his brethern and exhorted each of them after that he had necessyte. Anon
after he returned to the seek man and to Eulogius and said to them. My
brethern depart you not a sondre sith ye have so long lived in peace. And god
shall vysyte you by his mercy and grace / which has suffered these aduersytees
to come to you for to preue you. For he knows that your end is nygh / and ye
shall be fynably crowned in beatytude everlasting. And these words said they
went to their celles / and forty days after Eulogius deyed / and three days
after the seek man deyed / and went to our lord.

An holy fader named Cronius said that saint Anthony prayed an hole year to god
yt he would show hy^ the place of good people and the place of the evil.
Then appyered to him a geau^t so great yt he touched the clouds / and had
under his feet a flood like unto the sea And furthermore he saw souls flee
like birds / and all they yt flewhe above the hondes of the geaunt were saved
but they yt flewhe low were plunged in the water. And after this vysyon he
herd a voys saying to hy^ / that ye souls yt flewh above ye hondes of ye
geau^t were the souls of Just and good people which went strayt in to
heueuen / but the other were they yt went to dampnaco^n and perdyco^n for
their voluptees and flesshely pleasau^ces.

Of the dread of god.
THe psalmyste said yt the dread of god is the beginning of sapyence. And
therefore in this chapter is made menco^n of the same by such an example. A
monk demanded of thabbot Pyemon how the soul that dredeth not god / may
resyste the temptaco^ns. Then answered the holy fader. The soul sometime
dredeth god / but not when it is time / and thus parfyghtly it may not
withstonde the enemy if it dredeth not actuelly. For the dread of god is the
cause of the great perfecco^n of the soul. A brother demanded on a time of an
old fader / how the dread of god may come in ye soul. Then answerde the
holy man saying / if a man be humble / and that he condemn no person. And
also if he be large to do alms after his faculte he shall dread god. An
ancient old fader said to a Relygyous brother / that he ought to have three
things in him. That is to wit / the dread of god / parfyght humylyte / and
pouerte of spyryte. A monk came and complained to an aged fader saying to him.
I have an heart so enbarded yt I can not dread my god / to whom the holy man
said. I believe that if a man take good head in him self Iugyng hy^ a synnar /
that he should fere and dread god. After ye brother asked what it was to say
to take heed of him self. Tehnne the holy man answered / he yt takes head of
himself and thinks that he is a great synnar / and have remembrance of ye
great Judgment of god / at the which every man shall be / to render and give
aco^ptes of his works good and evil. And for so much if a man think on this
he shall fere and dread god. Here ben to be noted two things yt engendren ye
dread of god / that one is very humylyte / and yt other is to think of the
great day of the Judgment of god.

Here follows of the temptacyons of thenemye.
A Brother demanded of thabbot Achyles how the deuylles had power over us. To
whom the holy man answered by our wylles. For if our will consented not to do
evil / it should be no sin. In like wise then / if we submysed not our
will to the devil / he should have no power over us. For by symylytude. the
trees be cut and hewn with an axe / which is helued with the self tree /
and if it were not helued / it might not be hewn. All in like wise is it of
us. For the tree sygnefyeth our souls / and the helues our will / and the axe
the devil which may not hew without an helue / that is our will / by the
which he beteth our tree / that is to say our soul. Then if we refuse to
him the helue / he may not hew down with his axe the tree of our soul.

How a man may mortefye the vices
OO brother demanded of thabbot Moses / how a man might mortefye himself.
To whom the holy man said. If a man repute not hy^self to have be three year in
his sepulture / he may not be verily mortefyed in this world which has two
things / that one is yt he hate the rest of his body / the second yt he love
no vain glory. An holy man said yt a relygyous man that is occupied in good
operaco^n may not be surmou^ted of ye fend. For when the devil comes and
fyndeth him besy in good works / he departs Incontinent / but if he
excercyse any evil work / he is persecuted often of the fend / and makes him
to do werse yet if he may.

Here follows of perseueraunce.
THabbot Anthonye said that if a monk labor / and soon after rests without
to continue and then again labors / and then again leueth his labor /
he is not very perseuerau^t. For perseuerau^ce must be continued unto the end.
Also the scripture says he yt shall persevere unto the end / he shall be
saved.

Here follows of ye pain and labor of the old holy faders.
AN holy man said that a man ought always to labor until that he has wo^ne
Ihesu christ by grace. For he that shall have gotten hy^ ones shall never retche
of ye danger of ye fendes of hell / always a man ought contynuelly labor to
the end that in thynkyng on ye pain he kept himself and yt he dread to lose
his reward / for god for this cause would yt the childern of Israel were in
captyuyte in deserte by the space of.xl. year in suffryng there great pain to
the end that in having remembrance of their pain they should not forgete god
by sin.

Here follows exhortaco^n of doctrine.
A Man on a time demanded of thabbot Permenyon / how an obstynat man might
learn the word of god. To whom he answered that ye nature of the water is to be
soft the nature of the stone is to be herd / and yet always by contynuacyon
and not by force if the water fall upon the stone it makes there a concauyte.
And all in like wise it is of the word of god / for it is sweet and soft /
and our heart is hard / but if one here it often / and think on it
affectuously / the dread of god shall come to the soul / which was first
enharded / and shall make it to relynte in to an hole or concauyte which shall
be replenysshed and filled of grace.

How curyosyte ought to be eschewed
AN holy man said that a good relygyous person ought not to demand how that
one lives / ne how lives that other / to the end that by the answers that
he should here / he be not withdrawn fro holy prayer. And therefore to be more
sure / he ought to be stylle and say nothing. A brother demanded of his abbot
/ if any come in to my celle / that to me recou^teth vain words and
vnprouffytable / ought I to say to him / that he be stylle. The holy man
answered. Ne say to him nothing / for you may not keep hy^ fro spekyng / ne
thy self some time. And therefore we ought not to repreue our neighbor of a
vice / in which we fall after. Then said ye brother / what ought then to
be done. The holy man answered / if we will do well / we ought to give good
example to our neighbor / for the good example is of more great effect / than
ben the words.

How one ought teschewe noise.
AN holy man said / if any speak with the / either of scripture or of any other
matter / thou ought never to strive with him / But and if he say well /
accord ye to him / and if he say evil / say to him Ye know and can better
than ye say In following the Appostle which says Strive not with words. And
if you thus do you shall eschew hate / and shall get parfyght humylyte. And if
thou abide in thyn opinion in defendyng thy words / thou shall mow engendre
sklaundre. Some time also by ouermoche praysyng an other follows noise / of
the which moeuyng thou ought soueraynly to keep the. For there might to the
come so great Inconuenyente / that thou sholdest never be in peace nor in
rest. Wherefore it auylleth more to be still in resystyng his evil thought.
and to reyse himself dylygently in ye dread of god for to pray as well on
euenyng as on morning / and if you so do you shall not fere ne dread the
temptaco^n of the fend.

How one ought to keep scylence.
Saint Anthony said to his dyscyple / if you desire to have scylence / thou
owe not for that / to esteem that thou be for that cause the more virtuous /
but in keeping it / thou ought to repute thy self unworthy to speak. A
brother said to thabbot Sysoy that he desired to save his soul / but he would
know the manner how he might do it. Then thabbot answered to him / how may we
save our souls / when our tongue always speaks. As who says / he yt is not
still and keeps not scylence may not be saved An other brother asked if it
neded always to be stylle / to whom was answered / that ye / at lest unto yt
he were asked. For if a man be stylle / he shall be in peace over all
whersomeuer he be in keeping always scylence / the which to keep is none other
thing but to make a defycyle pilgrimage. An holy fader said that the pilgrimage
that is made for the honor of god is good / so that he keep scylence.

Here is made menco^n of the medytaco^ns of.xij. devout hermytes.
Twelve holy faders hermytes devout and solytarye were togydre as brethern
touchynh the pryncypall thoughts and cogytaco^ns spyrytuell that they had
herd in their celles and habytaco^ns for to live virtuously and to resyste the
temptaco^ns of the devil. Then said the first which was most oldest. I
have enforced my self with all my power to resyste the operaco^ns exterior or
outward / contrary to my health / having remembrance of the psalmyste saying.
Let us break the bonds of our enemies / and cast we abacke behind us all
their temptaco^ns. And I have edefyed in my thought / as a wall between my
soul and the bodily operaco^ns / to the end that I see them not. For all in
like wise as he yt is within the wall sees not him that is without. All in
like wise ought not a man to see ne to behold his outward works / to the end
that he gloryfye not him self / and ought to flee them as ye venym of a
serpent or of a scorpyon / and to cast them lightly behind fro his heart.
The second said / sith that I have renou^ced and forsaken the world. I have
said every day in my self. On this day you art born by grace / this day you
begynnest to serve god / this day you begy^nest to dwell here / be you always as
a pylgyme with out to have other estymaco^n of thy self / and thou shall be
shortly delivered. The third said. In the morning I mou^te up to my god by
prayer in stratchyng my self upon the earth / and prayeng him that he forgive
me my sins. After I pray to thangellys and other creatures reasonable that
they supplye and pray to god for me / and this done I goo to Iherusalem to see
that the Jews done. The fourth said. It seems me that I am with god and his
dyscyples in the mou^te of Olyuete / and me seems yt god says to me / be you
always with my dyscyples enhau^sed in contemplaco^n. And entremete yt with no
worldly things they abuse thy soul / in taking example of Marye magdalene /
yt which set her at feet of ye savior of ye world in heryng his words
which ben such Be ye all holy and parfyght / so says your fader of heaven.
And learn of him which is humble of heart and sweet. The fyfth said. I see
every day thangellys mou^tyng and descendyng for to call the holy souls and
to bring them in to paradyse / and do nothing but abide mine end in saying.
Lord god my heart and my conscience is ready and apparaylled when you shall will
to take it. The.vi. said. It seems to me every day yt after my prays god
says to me. Labor in the love of me / and I shall make the rest. Fight yet a
little against the enemy / after you shall see my health and my glory / if you
love me / and if you art my sone return the hardely to me which am thy fader
/ if you be my brother / have you shame for me / and endure the opbrobryes of the
people for the honor of me. For I have endured euylles Infenyte for the love
of the / if you be my sheep and my subgette follow my passion. The.vij. said. I
think always on the faith of god on hope / and on charity and dylecco^n. I have
hope for to enjoy my self / charity for dread ye I not hate any man / and
faith for to fortefye me against mine enemies The.viij. said. I abide in great
constau^ce the devil / whatsomeuer part he go. And I pray to god devoutly /
yt he do no gryef to any person / pryncypally to them that dread god. The.ix.
said. I consydere by contemplaco^n dyuyne the virtues angelyke / and in ye
mids of them the sone of god shynyng as the son over and above all
creatures And in consyderyng ye sweet armonye of angellys comes in to my
remembrance yt which is written. Lord god the heuens recounte thy glory / and
the fyrmament thy works meruayllous. And in this contemplaco^n al yt is upon
therth me seems dust and pouldre. The.x. said I see mine angel which is
always beside me and keeps me / and then I remember of yt which is written
by the psalmyste. I have always god tofore my thought. For he is always at my
right side to the end yt I be not moeued by evil temptaco^ns. And for as much
as I dread mine angel which mou^teth always to heaven feryng that he ne show
my works to god. The.xi. said. I have given my self to all virtues / that is
to wit to abstynence / chastyte / humylyte / charity / and dylecco^n / of
which what someuer part I find my self I am enuyronned of them / and
enforce my self to keep them / to the end that after my death / they may
witness that they have rested and dwelled in me. The xij. said / among you
faders which have the heavenly conuersaco^n / ye have also the sapyence dyuyne.
And for as much as I see you enhau^sed in virtuous works ye have all
renounced the world and the goods thereof. Then may I say without sin
that ye ben erthely angellys / and heavenly men / touching your conuersaco^n the
which is in heaven / of which things I me repute Indygne and unworthy for my
sins which accompanye me ouerall where I goo / on the right side and lift
side. And therefore I me repute worthy to be dampened. Thou shall be put
hastily with them that for their demerytes be in wepynges and in perpetuell
wayllynges. And in this I consydere some of them that strain their teeth for
the great pain that they endure in all the parties of the body. And in sign
of humylyte I cast my self on the earth taking ashes / and prayeng god that
it may please him to preserve me from these tourmentes. Furthermore I saw in
that hell a see all boyllynge / in the which ben much people of diverse
astates which cryen so strongely that it is Impossyble to express / and the
which ben pryued fro the mercy of god by cause of the enormyte of their
sins. And for as much considering these pains I weep by compassyon the
fall of worldely people which live in so great danger. And in this dooyng I
remember of that which is written in the psalm. My teres have been to me also
prouffytable as bread of the day and night. For by the moyen of them I have
nourysshed my soul spyrytuelly. All in like wise as the body is nourysshed
by bread materyalle. The which contemplacyons before said / of the which
sayenges and dyctes of the said holy Ancient and old faders we ought with all
our power to follow / to the end that in so dooyng we may come in to the
Royame of heaven. The which grant us he that reigned perpetuelly.

AMEN

Here fynyssheth the fourth part of the life of holy faders of Egypt and of
Greece.
Here follows the fyfth part and some small treatyses of the praysyng of
virtues etc.
Here follows the fyfthe part.
Here followed some small treattys of the praysyng of virtues / as well moral
as theologycall / upon which saint Macharye made his prologue / which was
auctour and compylatour of them spekyng in this manner.
FOr as much my right dear and byloued brother that sometime thou haste
affectuously required me to make some little book or treatise of the praysyng
of virtues. I desyryng to fulfylle thy request have compyled this present
book to the praysyng of god and to the salvation of thy soul / knowing the
great desire that thou haste to see the holy scryptures. And for that cause I
am glad to have accomplysshed that which has pleased the to require me / to
the end that thou may always prouffyte in the love of god / and also that I be
partener of thy good deeds. I wot well and know that he is well happy that
may only save his owen soul / but also I believe that he is yet more happy the
which in dooyng his health is cause of the health of other. And by cause I
pray the that thou read besyly this little compylacyon / and that thou do
that which therein is contained / to the end that by thy good ensample thou
save thy self and thy neighbor / and for thy labor thou shall receive in
heaven double reward. Of ye praysyng of charity / begy^ny^g in latin. Cu^
igitur etc. Caplm primu^.
IN praysyng then the virtues / I shall begin at the pryncypal / which is
charity / the which I admoneste the to keep above all things. For all in like
wise as the bread is most necessary among all other metes. In like wise
charity is most necessary among all other virtues. And also as the table is
evil served in which is no bread. All in like wise / right so thet oher
virtues without charity may no thing prouffyte. For without charity / for to
lamente / to weep / to be naked and chaste / to do alms / and to endure
martyrdom ben of no prouffyte ne vtylyte. This virtue has specially our lord
and redemer reco^maunded to us when he said. I give to you a new commandment
/ that is that ye love each other as I have loved you. And yet he says. Each
of you shall be known in this / if ye be my dyscyple or nay. For if ye love
each other by good charity and dyleccyon ye be mine Saint Iohay thappostle
prayseth it in saying / he that abides in charity abides in god / and god in
him. This virtue also was praised above all other of the great prechour the
chosen vessel of god my lord saint Poull when he said if I give all that I
have to the poor and if I brenne my body in a fire in dooyng penance. And if
I spoke all the langages of men and of angellys / and I have not charity. I am
but as a clock that sowneth / and all the things tofore said prouffyte me
nothing. And after he said / charity is benygne and sweet / pacyente to endure
all torments and aduersytees / and ready to give of his goods to the nedy. And
none other virtue but charity makes the martyrs to endure so many pains and
tourmentes as they have suffered and endured pacyently and in humylyte.

Of ye byndyng togydre and connection of charity and of humylyte / beginning in
latin. Certissime. Caplm.ij.
THou ought to believe and know certainly ye charity is not parfyghtly in a
man without humylyte and obedyence. For if thou have very charity / thou shall
be incontinent humble and obeyssaunt. Humylyte is a great virtue / for it
makes men mortal to be heavenly. By humylyte ye devil is surmounted and
overcome / by hit the grynnes of him be eschewed In like wise as says saint
Anthonye to thabbot Pastor the which had seen over all the world the grynnes
and nets of the devil set up / for to take the poor souls / and it was
said to him that humylyte oonly might put away all those grynnes without to
fall therein. And he said it not oonly for him self / but for us which be
sinners and much less than he in perfecco^n of manners and virtues / to the
end that by this moyen we may eschew the grynnes of the devil. And
furthermore the life of an holy and devout hermyte named Martyn shows to us
what virtue is humylyte / the which from his yougth was much humble and
humayne / and in such wise loved of god / that when he came to the holy
sacrament of the altar. An angel mynystred to him the same holy sacrament /
we ought then to see and consydere what virtue and yefte is of humylyte / by
the which a man mortal is thus aggreable to god.

Of ye virtue of contynence Caplm.iij.
TO the end that thou know / to whom auaylleth the virtue of contynence. Thou
ought to wit yt it consysteth not oonly in etyng and drynkyng / but in
spekyng / in slepyng / in clothyng and in other many things. And for so much
to the end yt thou be contynent and sobre / seche no metes over delycyous ne
delycatyf / and take none hour to ete / and also take none head to gourmans and
glotons which ete more than is to them necessary. And know for certain that
eueryche person / of so much more as he shall have labored in this life / of
so much more shall he have more great reward in heaven. And to the end yt it
seem not to the that this virtue be over gryeuous. I shall say to ye an
example. A man named Dorotheus of Thebes lived in this manner / yt he went and
fette stones at ye see side / and every year made an house and gave it to them
yt had none / and in ye night to the end yt they should have to ete he made
hottes and paners to selle them / and he ete but a little bread and cole
wortes / and drank water / and lived in such wise sith his young age. Never
man saw hy^ sleep on bed / but when he might no more wake / and ye force of
ouermoche watch and besynes caused hy^ to close his eyes in such manner yt
sometime in etyng he slept and let fall ye mete out of his mouth. And on a
time among ye other in passing by a way all myry / in which he fylle down
all slepyng / and lay there till on the morn that he awoke / and he then
fyndyng him self in yt ordure and fylthe / began to say. O my god if you
make the au^gellys to sleep. I am not abashed though you make me to sleep /
and this he said in dremyng / or for to in pugne ye devil which would have
tempted him. On a time he was strongly seek / and he lived then as straytly
as he had be acustomed. Then an other old fader asked of him wherefore he
slew so his body. To whom he answered. I slay him because he sleeth me I have
written to the / the co^tynence of this holy man / to the end yt you know / yt
contynence is free to observe to them that have good will to do it. And for to
give to ye knowleche the great dyfference of ye life yt we led / and of ye
life of some holy faders. The same Dorotheus made every year a celle / and gaaf
it for the love of god to ye Indygent and nedy. And he lay upon no bed / and
ete not but bread and herbs / and drank water. I say not this example to
the end yt you do in like wise / but to the end yt you humble and meke thy self /
and to see how our old faders were contynent / and ask no metes over
delycyous ne delycatyfe. For we read of the abbot Moses that during all his
life or there about he ete but bread / and yet he labored and wrought fast.
The space of.vi. year he prayed every night devoutly without leyeng down of his
body / and without to close his eyes / but if it were by great constraynt
which made him a little to close them. And he went about to the celles of
the relygyouses / and bare to they^ water how well that it was far fro the
cloystre.

Of the contynence of the sight. Caplm.iiij.
THe virtue of contynence consysteth not oonly in absteynynge from mete / but
also in absteynyng him self to see and behold worldly things and
concupyscyble. To this purpose we read of thabbot Pyor which departed fro the
house of his fader and went in to an hermytage promysyng that he would never
see person of his friends. But his sister meruayllously desyryng to see hy^ /
prayed to ye bishop of the dyocyse wherein he dwelled / yt he would write to ye
holy faders of thermytage yt they would send to her the said Pyor to the end yt
she might see hy^ The which thing done the holy faders commanded Pyor yt he
should go see his sister / and to the end yt he would be obeyssau^t he departed
and went with an other man / when he was come in to ye house of his sister /
she made to hy^ great chere / and saw hy^ all at her ease / and after he
returned in to his hermytage / and when he was comen again because he had
thurst he made an hole in ye earth by his hermytage where he found water much
bitter / of ye which he dra^ke / and used it unto the end of his days / how be
it that it was much bitter / and after there might noman dwell in ye place
there. An other time thabbot Moses and his monks made a pyt where they found
no water. So appyered to them about ye hour of myddaye thabbot Pyor the which
descended in to ye pytte smytyng three times in therthe / and incontinent ye
water sprang up / and after he vanysshed away. And therefore my brother thou have
seen and herd that the contynence of the sight is necessary. Thou haste also
herd how this abbot Pyor was never dyssobeyssau^t to his kynne / but for
tobeye to his superyors he went to his sister / and yet he saw her not / for
he closed his eyes for to keep his first promise. And therefore I pray the to
follow this holy man / and be not curyous to goo see thy parents or friends /
to the end yt in seeing behind the / yt is to the world / the which you have
forsaken and renou^ced / thou be not by leuyng thy teeres and prayers turned
in to a roche of salt / that is to say in to a deed image or statue / as was
the wife of Loath / the which because she looked behind her / she was in like
wise turned And to this end remember of the gospel saying / that he that
puts his hand to the plough of penance. And looks behind him / that is
to say to worldly things / is nothing couenable to the kingdom of god.

Of contynence of speech Caplm.v.
I Admoneste the also that in thy word and speech thou be sobre / to the end
that thou may say with the psalmyste. I have said that I have kept my ways
/ to the end that I sin not in my tongue. I have set ward in my mouth
doubtyng that I should speak evil Have remembrance of the sister of Moses /
the which for as much as she spoke evil of her brother / she becam lazare /
and was seven days out of her house / the which passed she was guarysshed by
the merytes of her said brother / of the whom she had spoken evil. We ought
not to apply our tongue to speak evil of our neighbor. For we should not
abuse it over folyly / seen that it was given to us pryncypally to praise god
and his saints. And we ought to have remembrance that all detractours shall
be pryued fro the Royame of heaven and the company of ryghtfull men. And for as
much to the end that we be not pryued fro thens / eschew we detraccyon / and
keep we us that we bachyte not our neighbors / the which we ought to love as
our self / and fro spekyng words vnprouffytable. For ye gospel says that
men shall render acomptes at the day of dome of all ydell words that we shall
have said. We say a word to be ydell / when it prouffyteth not to him that
says it / ne also to hy^ yt hereth it / keep the then to say words
excytyng to laughyng dysordynat / but enforce the to say to the people such
thing as shall excyte them to ye prouffyte and health of their souls. And let
always thy word be reasonable and prouffytable. It is recou^teth of two wise
men that one named Theo / and ye other Ammon / the which Theo was the most
great clerk of thegypcyens / and he held hy^ stylle and spoke not to any
person in xxx. year. That other was never angry / ne swear / ne said any vain
word which caused any heaviness to any man And in ye time of these two holy men
/ there was an other named Helyas which dwelled in an hermytage by ye space of
an hundred and ten year in fasting always without to speak much to any
person. Therefore take heed what cautele and what prudence thou ought to have
in thy words / by the example of the holy men aforsayd. And to the end that
this virtue please ye / herkene what says Zacharye / which herupon asked of
thabbot Moses which said to him / that there was nothing better than to say
nothing and be stylle in time and place / and in the end he was saved because he
kept scylence dylygently. Then to the end that thou may be saved love and
keep scylence. I have read also of a devout man / the which to the end yt he
might keep scylence bare contynuelly in his mouth a stone. Then I pray the
affectuously that thou keep scylence / for Infenyte goods ben lost for the
sin of ye tongue.

How vile clothyng ought to be desired. Caplm.vi.
MY friend wit that contynence in clothyng is much necessary. There be much
people that wene that desirous ambycyon to have precious Robes be no sin /
but they deceive them self / for if it were not sin / god had never
praised Saint Johan Baptyste for his clothyng which was vile. For he said to
the people that went for to see him what is that ye have seen / have ye seen a
man cladde with precious Robes. As who says / nay / for they that use and be
cladde with precious Robes / ben in the palayses and houses of kings and
princes temporell / and not in deserts. Saint Johan then was not cladde with
precious clothyng. For such people so clothed serve not god / but to
temporell lords / he was cladde with skynnes of Camellys oonly. And therefore if
he that was saynctefyed of god in the womb of his mother / and was so much
loved of god and was a very prophet and more than a prophet has be cladde
with the skin of a Camele / we yt be miserable sinners ought to be content
with vile vestementes without to desire other / eueryche after his astate. Yet
furthermore saint Peter in his epistle defends precious clothyng / but if it
be to please the world. Then we ought not to seche they^ / but rather we
ought to seche virtuous clothing for our soul / and not for our body / the
which clothyng is charity / faith / humylyte / bounte / and benygnyte / for of
these virtues our soul ought to be garnysshed for to live perpetuelly with
god. And how well that our body be aorned with gold and silver or with
precious vesture. Always it ne is but duste and fylthe / and therefore we ought
not to demand the eases of our body. For if we nourysshe it after his
appetyte / we nourysshe our enemy with us / by cause that a man has no
gretter enemy than his body / the which draws his soul to sin if he
may. Therefore each person ought to hold it subgette and to chastyse it by
thexample of saint Poul which says. I chastyse my body / and render it to
seruytude.

How all things ought to be done by reason and mesure. Caplm.vij.
OVre body ought to be chastysed by waky^ges and by diverse other manners / to
the end that it draw not our soul to sin / but nevertheless it must be
done in such manner / that in chastysyng it / he leave not to do good works /
for he yt would make lene and put his body to afflycco^n in such wise yt he
may not continue in virtuous works he should not be wise ne dyscrete. And you
ought to understand yt ye virtues of scylence / nakedness / abstynence / and
chastysyng of his body ought to be done with dyscrecyon / the which is a
sovereign virtue / and without the which none operaco^n is vayllable / and
where she shall be / it shall be merytorye / by defaulte of dyscreco^n the
operaco^n is not prouffytable / wherefore we may say that dyscreco^n is mother of
ye other virtues. And therefore I admoneste the yt you take dyscreco^n in all thy
works / to the end that thou fall not on that one side ne on that other. Of
this virtue of dyscreco^n you have in ye life of faders called in latin Vitas
pat^u^. for thabbot Anthonye says / that there be some yt make lene their
bodies / but for yt they do it not dyscretly they ben well far fro the Royame
of god.

Of the well of conpuncco^n which pryncypally comes for a man to mortefye him
self. Caplm.viij.
But for as much as in all operacyon is required conpunccyon. It byhoueth
first to know the dyffynycyon of it. Then I trow that very mortyfycacyon
may not be gotten by any person without conpunccyon. And therefore I pray the
that in all thy works / be it in keeping abstynence / or that thou love to
be evil clothed / or that thou wyl^ wake / or do any other helthfull work /
that thou do it all to the honor of god / if thou weep for thy sins / there
shall ensyewe thereof conpunccyon and dyspleasaunce / but thou oweste to do it
in such wise that no person be sklaundred / but rather edefyed in to good /
have then conpuncco^n and heaviness in thyn operaco^ns / to the end that thou
may say with the psalmyste. Lord god I offer to the my sacrefyce all full
of the marghe of conpunccyon. Then ought thou to know that he offreth
sacrefyce to god the which gives him self all over to god / the which
thing apperteyneth proprely to relygyous people / and to they^ of their
vocacyon. By the marghe of which sacrefyce / we understand the conpunccyon /
dyspleasaunce and contrycyon at the heart of him that sacrefyceth to god.
Then sacrefyce without marghe is operaco^n without con^^yco^n The psalmyst
speaks of this marghe in a place saying thus. Thy sacrefyce be made fat of
the fattenes of contryco^n / which we call marghe. The virtue of conpuncco^n
is much great. For in the life of faders is written of an holy man the which
said / that to us it were right necessary to weep incessauntly. The which came
again after that he was deed and said to his brethern in weeping bytterly
because they would not weep. Maledycco^n be to you Maledyccyon be to you. And
by cause we may see here what is to us necessary during this life always to
weep / to the end that after our death in this world we descend not in to the
tourmentes of hell / the which thing we ought gladly do / consyderyng that
this life mortalle is miserable and transytorye / but that other shall never
have end / in the which the Just persons shall have Joy perpetuelly with
the au^gellys. And the miserable sinners shall be tourmented by the deuylles
with the dampened in hell perpetuelly without remyssyon. For it is written that
in hell is no redempco^n that is to them that by their demerytes and
deservings be dampened. And therefore if we may not weep as often as we would /
let us persyste and co^tynue in devout prayer. For it is in the puyssaunce of
our lord to give to us habondaunce of teeres. And to this purpose is contained
in the life of faders an example of a relygyous man which complained to an
holy man saying. My soul desires to have teres and to weep / like as the
other old faders have wept / but it can not have it To whom the holy man
answered. Thou ought to persyste in prayer / for thou may not obtain so
soon that which thou demaundeste / knoweste thou not well that the childeren
of Israel were by the space of forty year in deserte tofore they might come
in to the land of promyssyon. The teres then ben the land of promyssyon /
to the which if thou may come / thou shall no more dread thassaultes and
temptacyons of the enemy of hell. It is reherced of thabbot Arsenius / that
had always tofore his eyes a clothe to wype away the teres yt issued out
contynuelly. So then ought we by example dyspose us to wepynges and
wayllynges / if he and the other holy faders which were so Just / mortefyed
them self in this manner / by much more greter reason we sinners ought to
weep in thynkyng on the death and on the terryble day of Judgment of god. And
for this cause says Amon to one of his brethern / we ought to be as ye thief
in the prison / the which awayteth none other thing / but that he be led to
hangyng / and demands often / where is the Judge in wayllyng and weeping his
last day. So then ought we in this manner to weep and wayle our great
sins in awaytyng ye right great and souerayn Judge our savior Ihesu christ.
And if we do thus / we shall mow be saved / and we shall have very and ferme
contryco^n and repentance. And thus for to do / it is to us needful and
necessary to think on the pains and tourmentes of hell where as the worm
of ye remorse of conscience shall never deye / the fire shall not be quenched /
the weeping shall never cease / ne the pain shall never have end.

Of ye qualyte of conpucco^n Caplm.ix.
IT byhoueth not after weeping and wayllyng to return to sin for which has
be wept and waylled. For every man that after his penance retourneth to his
sin / resembles to an hounde that retourneth to his vomyte. There ben many
that oftymes weep for their sins. And nevertheless they cease not any thing
for to sin and offend god their maker The prophet Ysaye exhorts us saying
wasshe you and be clean in heart. And upon this / is to be noted that he that
wepeth his sin / is not clean / when he begins again to sin / but he is
wasshen and abides clean / which by wepeth his offenses / and retourneth not
again thereto.

Of the manner to pray to god our maker. Caplm.x.
Sith that I have given to the to know and understand what conpunc^yon is /
there rests now oonly that thou know the manner to pray god / and to make
supplycacyon to our lord Ihesu Christ / the which he showed to his dyscyples
wha^ he said to them in this manner / be not proli^e ne long in your prayers
and supplycacyons / but pray ye in saying thus. Our fader that art in heaven
etc. as it is contained in the Pater noster. In the which appyereth that the
orayson ought to be short / but if it be prolonged of an ardaunt affecco^n and
desire toward our maker and redemer. It is said that Arsenius abode from the
son gooyng down unto the son up again in prayer. I will not say that thou
so ought to do / but at the least have the desire also ardaunt in
devotion when thou prayest god a little time / as be had in prayeng to god
all the night. One of thauncyent faders said that orayson contynuel corrects
the thought. An other said yt like as it is Impossyble to see his vysage in
thycke and troubled water. All in like wise the soul if it be not purged of
his evil thoughts and cogytaco^ns may not have contemplacyon toward god our
maker. Pambo ye holy relygyous man having under his charge fyfty relygyous
persons did nothing but ye which was to hy^ necessary to ye spyrytuell
life / and took none head but to prayers / every day he made three hundred
prayers to god / and to the end yt he would not leave one / he took three hundred
stones / and at every prayer / he took out one stone oonly / and after when he
found no moo stones / he knew well that he had all said. Therefore we ought us
gretely to meke our self / which ben far dyfferent fro the life of holy
faders. And we be not prompte and ready to make prayer like as they did.
Orayson Joined with contryco^n and compuncco^n is a great virtue. And therefore I
will yt thou understand / yt our savior wyllyng to pray / went up in to the
montayne / to sygnefye to us when we pray we ought to go up in to the montayne
of heaven by good and devout co^templaco^n / but all they yt pray / go not up.
For he that demands in his prayer the death of his enemy / or coueyteth
temporell goods / to the end that he praised among worldly people / gooth not
up in to the montayne. And in the contrary he that in humylyte prays for the
health of his soul / and for his neighbor / gooth up in to the same montayne.
Now think then to read his admonyco^ns to the end that you may come fro
mortyfycaco^n to conpucco^n / and fro conpunccyon to the manner of prayer and to
require god thy maker.

Of the bataylle of vices against the virtues. Caplm.xi.
FOr as much as thou art suffysauntly Instruct to know the excellence of the
virtues / there rests now for to know the contrauersyes against the said
virtues. So shall thou then mow surmounte all vices in alledyng the virtues
against them. The which opposycyon / or alledyng against they^ oftymes
prouffyteth. For a man by the same is lift up to devotion. And the vices ben
retrayned in dooyng the virtue contrary to every vice. For against lecherye /
it byhoueth to be chaste. Against wrath and Ire / it byhoueth to have pacyence.
Against dread confydence. Against heaviness spyrytuell Joy. Against ferdfulnes of
courage / strength and constaunce. Against auaryce largess. against pride
humylyte. Against hate charity. Saint Poull speaking of this battle says. The
flesh coueyteth against the spyryte / and the spyryte against the flesh.
These tweyne here ben in such wise contrary / that sometime is not done that /
which would be well done. And therefore my right dear friend be allewaye
dylygent to read / and to do the things tofore said / if thou be tempted to
sleep ouermoche / enforce the to overcome the temptacyon by wakyng / if thou
art tempted to take the eases of thy body have remembrance of saint James
cosyn of our savior / the which never ete no flesh / ne never ware lynnen /
ne never ennoynted his head / how well that in his contree the custom was to
do so. If thou be tempted with worldly delyces / remember the of saint Johan
baptyst / the which was saynctefyed in his moders belly / of whom god says /
that among the childern of Adam that were born of wy^men / there was none found
yt was so great. It is found in scripture / yt he ne ete but wild honey / and
herbs / if you can not forgive to hy^ yt has offended the / remember our
redemer / ye which pardo^ned they^ yt crucefyed him / and suffered diverse
pains for the. For for ye love of the / he was made man passyble and mortal /
which was Inmortall and Impassyble / he took for us in the womb of the holy
virgyn Marye flesh humayne to the end that he should deye for to redeem the /
he was beten and smeten with buffetes and suffletes / and all byspette in his
precious vysage / crowned with thorns. And at the last crucefyed in the
cross / and all for to save the / and when he was in the cross he said. My
fader pardonne them that crucefyen me / for they know not what they do. Thus
he that was crucefyed without cause / prayed for his enemies. And thou wylt not
pardonne them that offend the. I believe if that thou thoughtest well on this
that is here tofore contained that thou sholdest lyghtely forgive them that
offend to the. And in so dooyng thou shall mow appease thyn Ire or wrath.
And in accomplysshyng the commandments of god to love eueryche as it is
written. Love ye your enemies / and do good to them that persecute you. And
pray for them that challenge and do you wrong. If thou be tempted to goo see
diverse Regyons and contrees / repute then thy self as deed and crucefyed to
the world / and then thou shall overcome that temptaco^n. For you shall
think on nothing but on thy death / if thou wylt take heed that the world to
whom you art deed reyse the not again / or that it be not in the raised again
/ herke what the appostle says of the battayll of vices against ye virtues / if
ye mortefye says he the deeds of the flesh by spyrytuell deeds / ye shall
live spyrytuelly / and therefore if you wylt live / it byhoueth the to mortefye
the vices by the virtues / as hate by charity / worldely heaviness by spyrytuell
Joy / dyscencyon by peace / malice by bou^te / cruelnes by swetenes Gloto^nye
by sobrenes and abstynence / and lecherye by chastyte. And if thus you destroy
and mortefye the operaco^ns of the flesh / certainly thou shall come to the
Royame of heaven with god our maker and our redemer and his angellys.

Of the affection for to study well. Caplm.xij.
IT byhoueth not long to occupye the time in things tofore said. For I will
that thou read in scryptures to the end / that that which to the is necessary
thou may find in the same / for I believe that the comaundementes of god may
not parfyghtly he known but in redyng. And ^oo much more that a man is
contynuell in redyng / so much more ^e understands it. For the land of so
much more as it dylygently ered and labored / so much more brings it
forth great habundaunce of fruit / how be it that a man has the understanding
little and dulle / nevertheless he may learn the scryptures. For to him that
shall have faculte and will to read shall be given understanding for to
understand that which he redeth. And he that naturelly has no understanding
/ or that be rude / nevertheless by his labor he knows some thing right so he
that despyseth to augmente to dyuyne that to him is co^mysed shall be dampened
at Judgment. And therefore I pray the to read and study gladly / for much
prouffyte co^^^^ of the study of scryptures. And you shall learn in them that
which we know not. Ysydore says that by prayer we be purged spyrytuelly. And
by often redyng / we be enseygned and taught. That one and that other is good /
but when it byhoueth to pray / it is evil done to estudye or to read for it
is said comunely / that to estudye is ^^rsed which lets the dyuyne service.
Also he that will be with god by grace he ought to pray often / and often to
study. For in prayeng we speak to god / and in studyeng god speaks us. And
therefore my brother and friend / it byhoueth that you read and pray often. For
the lecture gives to us knowledge of god. and prayer takes away the derkenes
of the soul. By the lecture we have knowledge of god and of his commandments
/ by yt we may know what glory and felycyte they that be saved have in heaven
By that also we understand what myserye and what pain have they in hell that
be dampened. And by that we know the sentence that shall be proferred at day
of Judgment upon the good and upon the evil. For to the evil shall be said /
go ye in to the fire of hell. And to the good. Come ye well blessed in to the
kingdom of my fader / the which is apparaylled to you sith the begy^nyng of
the world. And furthermore by estudye we learn how we ought to bear pacyently
ye aduersytees of this world / and how we should conteyne us in prosperyte.
And by this in ye chapter following I shall determyne of ye aduersytees of the
holy faders / how they have suffered them pacyently / to the end yt you be the
more prompte to endure them. And that by the same you myghtest have the Royame
of heaven which is apparaylled for them that be good.

How one ought pacyently to endure ye aduersytees and maladyes Caplm.xiij
IF by adventure hap to come to the any maladye or aduersyte. I pray the
read the scripture. For you shall find therein what god says. Them that I
love. I chastyse / and it is a sign that god loves a person when he
chastyseth him and sends to him some aduersyte / which aduersytees you
ought to suffer pacyently. And to this purpose I shall recou^te to the an
example. There was a man named Benyamyn which heled and guarysshed seek people
/ by his touching only they^ / the which Benyamyn fylle in to a dropesye / and
becam so greatly swollen yt he might not go out of his celle / without to break
up ye door. And never theles he had such pacyence / ye he vysyted the other
seek people / and in that he might / he conforted they^ saying / pray ye for
my soul / and retche not for my body. For when I was hole I retche not to
serve god / and therefore take example of him. Furthermore herkene of a monk
named Steven / which conforted the seek men after his power / and lived unto
the age of.lx. year / but this not withstonden he was smeten with a maladye
incurable / in such wise ye him byhoued to cut of his legs / the which
because of ye maladye were roten / and nevertheless he ceased not to make
baskettes in admonestyng the other that they should not be angry of his maladye
/ and yt they should not think but on the end. For he said / all ye god does
is vtyle and prouffytable. And I know well that these pains here ben given to
me for my sins / so had I lever endure here a little pain transytorye / than
herafter to suffer the pains of hell eternally. And therefore by his example /
when any aduersyte shall come to the / dyspose the to bear and suffer it
pacyently. And consydere if the holy men have given thankynges to god in their
aduersytees / then should we sinners endure pacyently the euylles that come
to us. For it is written that by diverse trybulaco^ns / ought men to come to
heaven. Then ought we strongely to love trybulaco^ns to the end that we be
heretrers of that sovereign glory. For the sinner that shall not be punysshed
here / shall be punysshed in hell. Also whiles that we live we ought to desire
to bear and endure sekenesses and trybulaco^ns for ye honor of god.
Furthermore you ought to know / that a man is persecuted in this world for
many causes. First for to approve his pacyence / in the manner yt Job and Thobye
were tourmented / the which have be proved ferme and constau^t to the end
that we ensyewe their pacyence. Secondely a man is persecuted to the end yt he
be not proud / and this proprely apperteyneth to saints. For thappostle says
of him self. To the end yt I not enhau^se my self for the great reuelaco^ns yt
I have had. God has given to me the pryckyng of my flesh / that is to say
the spyryte of Satan which me te^pteth contynuelly. And after ye thappostle
knew the prouffyte yt he had by the same pryckyng / he said. I enjoyed me
right gladly in my temptaco^ns and trybulaco^ns to the end yt I had the grace of
god. Thyrdely a man is tourmented in his body for his sins / when god will
not yt the sinner be dampened for his sins / but he will punysshe temporally /
as of the paralytyke to whom (...). Thy sins ben forgyuen yt take ^hy bed
and go thy way. Thus by ye he pardo^ned to him his sins to fore or he gaaf
to him bodily health / it appyereth yt this maladye came for his wyckednes.
Fourthely a man is persecuted to the end yt the virtue and power of god or of
his saints / be by that persecuco^n showed to the people / as it is written in
the gospel of him yt was born blind. For god said yt he ne his parents had
not sinned / but he was so born for to show the glory of god. Fyfthely some
man is tormented in this world to the end yt he begin then his hell / the
which after his death shall never end And this is understand oonly of evil
and cursed people / as Anthyothus. Herod / and king Pharao / the which began
their hell in this world. And of them it is written. Our lord god punysshed
them with punycyon / that is to wit temporell and eternalle. And for as much
as we know not wherefore god sends to us the aduersytees. Therefore we ought
agreably to suffer them / in weeping and wayllynge our sins / to the end that
al turn to our prouffyte. For we ought to believe certaynely / that none evil
shall abide unpunished / but if it effaced and put away by very penance /
or by the mercy of god / or purged in purgatory / or in hell perpetuelly.
Then byhoueth to have hope / though so be that one have sinned. For what
soever sin that one has co^mysed / the mercy of god is much more great than
is the sin. And for as much as we speak of pardonne of sins I shall
recounte here a fair hystorye.

Theodosius the Emperor the which how be it that in a great furye / he had
put to death.vij. thousand men / Nevertheless in weeping and cryeng god mercy /
he received grace and pardon of ye sin. And therefore ought no man to despair
/ but with good affecco^n to demand mercy of god. And to the end that ye know
the cause wherefore he did do slay them. I shall recou^te herafter the hystorye
all alonge to the end that you take thereby example. For first thou may have
hope to obtain pardonne and forgyuenes of thy sins / for as much as
Theodosius yt had slain so much people had in little time remyssyon of his
sins. Secondly thou shall mow get humylyte. For how well that he was
Emperor / always by thercomynycaco^n and admonyco^n of saint Ambrose / he
converted and meked him in such wise / that he reputed hy^ self the most
miserable of all other sinners. Thyrdely you may be excyted to great effusyon
and habundau^ce of teeres / consyderyng yt he entryng in to the church he
arouse and wette with his teres the pament of the same. And therefore know that
there is noman which has not any Inperfecco^n in him self be it in will or in
deed. For we see yt if a man eschew lecherye / anon he is in danger to fall
in the sin of auaryce / and if he eschew auaryce / he falls in envy / and
if he eschew envy / anon the fend presents tofore him many other euylles
by which he may take him. And therefore it is hard to a man to keep him self
from all the temptaco^ns of ye fend. But when our thought is aided and helped
with the might and grace of god / he may lyghtlt resyste all the temptaco^ns
and machynaco^ns of him.

Here follows thystorye of Theodosius of whom is spoken to fore
Capitulum.xiiij.
IN the cite of Thessalonye which was greatly and strongly peopled / there meued
a great and meruayllous deuysyon because whereof / by the cytezeyns of the same
were some of the Iuges stoned to death / and some other dysmembred / whereof
Theodosius the emperor was in such wise meued in Ire / which commanded
expressly yt all the cytezeyns good and evil generally should be put to death.
And thus for that cause were there cruelly slain mo than.vij. thousand men
without keeping of any order or attemperau^ce. Of the which so great / horrible
/ and cruel occysyon was Saint Ambrose aduertysed which then was bishop of
Mylane which declared and made denounce the said Theodosius accursed and
excomynyed. Notwithstondyng yt he was Emperor in showing himself a man
constau^t / and all given to punysshe and correct ye wicked and obstynat
sinners of ennorme and gryeuous offenses which they co^mysed against our lord
and his church. The which Theodosius after yt by certain time he had
obstynatly sustained ye said sentence of exco^mynycaco^n. In a solemn day as
he was in ye said cite of Mylane / he concluded notwithstondyng the said
sentence to go to the church / as other christian men did / but ye seeing saint
Ambrose came hastly against hy^ / and began corageously to cry in saying. O
Theodosius I am abashed how the devil has you so horrybly blinded in making
yt to fall in this dampnable obstynaco^n / yt you ne can ne will know the
enormyte of thy great sin / which you have co^mysed in shedynge cruelly ye
humayne blood of christian men / childern and servants of god / how dare you
presume to will enter now in to the Temple of our lord / if by adventure thine
Empire and thy lordshyp temporell let the to know thy sin so hyhoueth well
ye reason surmounte the same domynaco^n and seygnorye / thou ought to know
and understand that thou art mortal / and shall become pouldre and ashes
like as other men. And suppose not for thy pourpre and other precious
vestymentes to be more worth than thy subgettes / if thou be prynct or lord /
nevertheless thou art a seruau^ For god is the lord of lords and the king of
kings / how then dare you with thyn eyes infecte by Ire in any wise see or
byholde ye temple sacred and hallowed or to march and come nygh ye pauement of
the same with thy feet which ben so much foull and pollute. How dare you
lift up thy hands to god out of which yet the blood of ye Innocents drop
out / how also dare you receive ye precious body and blood of Ihesu christ /
in thy mouth by ye which has be pronounced the sentence furyous da^pnable and
wicked / by which ben deed so many Innocents servants of god. Seen then
ye gryeuous enormyte of thy caas. I defend yt his church / and enjoin yt to
depart from hens / to the end yt to thy first evil you put not thereto ye
second. And furthermore I exhort the yt you bear pacyently the sentence of
excomynycaco^n against ye pronounced / the which is ye medecyne of thy soul.
The Emperor seeing the constau^ce and laudable hardynesse of saint Ambrose / and
by his remonstrau^ces touched with ye holy ghoost concluded in himself to
obey him / and so returned to his palace / where he abode and was by ye space
of.viij. months / with out to go or issue out / weeping there by great
contryco^n and meruayllous habou^dau^ce of teeres / the detestable sin by him
co^mysed. And approchyng ye feste of ye natyuyte of our savior Ihesu christ.
One his knight and steward of household named Ruffyn which was much famylyer
with him seeing his wepynges and wayllynges / ye which he had so long
continued prayed hy^ yt he would declare to hy^ ye cause of ye same. To whom he
answered in this manner. Alas my friend thou know not the gryeuous euylles and
ennoyes yt I suffer. I weep for my great myserye / the which I know excedeth
all other / consyderyng that the yates and doors of the church be opene to the
poor servants of god the which go when them seem good / but they ben
shytte and closed to me and by right full cause / which is to me ouermoche
gryeuous. And god knows what great syghynges and wayllynges made his heavy and
desolate heart. For they were so sorrowful and so often renewed ye oftymes they
brake his words / in such wise yt uneath he might achyeue yt he would say.
Then the said knight which was much dyspleasau^t and gryeued of ye
desolaco^n of his lord and maystre the Emperor said to him yt he would go to
saint Ambrose / and should enforce hy^ self to do so much toward him yt he
should assoylle him of ye said sentence and yt he should be permysed to enter
in to the church. The which thing the said Emperor byleued to be right hard
to obtain of ye said saint Ambrose / consyderyng ye rygorous affecco^n that he
had so sharply to punysshe and to correct you defaultes co^mysed in the
irreverence of god. This notwithstanding ye said Ruffyn transported him to
saint Ambrose. And the emperor desyryng to know ye answer / went all a far
after hy^ / but incontinent when saint Ambrose saw the said Ruffyn approach to
hy^ seeing tofore what he would say and require of him / began to say to him
such words or semblable in substance. I meruaylle me of ye Ruffyn how you
have no shame to come hither for to baye like an hounde in the face of god and
of his saints. Ruffyn suffryng pacyently the words of saint Ambrose / and
taking in him courage / notwithstanding the great rygour of them kneled down on
his knees tofore him in showing by all humylyte the hard and meruayllous
dyspleasaunce of the Emperor / which desired none other thing but to render
and yield him obeyssau^t child of the church / delybered and concluded in
himself to receive and bear such penance as should please to Saint Ambrose
to charge him. Saint Ambrose consyderyng that Theodosius had be long time
without to come to him / and doubtyng yet of his obstynacye and pertynacyte
said to Ruffyn / that it was dyffycle and hard to him to believe that which he
said. And with that he said to him that the said Theodosius was not yet worthy
to enter in to the church / but nevertheless when he shall be aduertysed of his
conuersyon he shall be content that he come to him. These things thus said.
Ruffyn taking leave of saint Ambrose / returned to the Emperor his maystre /
to whom he reported that he was not yet well appeased / wherefore he cou^seylled
that he should dyfferre yet a little his gooyng to him. But nevertheless the
Emperor beholding that he was nygh to the yates of the church where as saint
Ambrose was / delybered and concluded in him self to go thither to endure
pacyently all Iniuryes and obprobryes that he would say to him in saying that
he had well deserved them / he then coming to the yate of the said church
presum^^^^ to enter within / but sent to saint Ambrose humbly prayeng him that
it might please him for to assoylle him of the said sentence of excomynycacyon.
Then came to him saint Ambrose saying. O Theodosius I have horror to see thy
presence which is much cruel. For thou have over much inhumaynely showed
thy great wodenes against god in brekyng his holy laws and commandments.
Theodosius answered. A holy man. I proteste that I entende not to do any thing
against the holy catholyke instytuco^ns. And I will not enforce me to enter by
vyolence in to the church / but I pray the that it please the to do to me
that grace to assoylle me and to unbind me of the sentence of excomynycacyon
in which I am bounden / in prayeng god of forgyuenesse of my sins / and to
me openyng the yates of his church / the which he would should be opened unto
all very penytauntes. Then saint Ambrose said to him. I would well know
Theodosius / sith the horrible occysyon which thou haste commysed what
medecyne haste thou given to thy soul for to hele it of her mortal wounds.
To whom the Emperor answered. It apperteyneth to the reverend fader to give
to me the penance / and to me to receive it humbly. Saint Ambrose seeing his
great humylyte said to him. For as much as thou haste given Judgment in
horrible furour and no thing after reason. I enjoin the that within.xxx.
days next following thou do write and ordeyne a law that may be cause to
avoid thine Ire. And by the same law you shall know if thyn opinion shall be
rightful and Just / or unrightful / the which penance the Emperor
received much humbly. And composed the same law which he wrote with his owen
hand / whereof the tenor is this / if an Emperor from hens forth condemn to
death one or many men / he shall be holden to do withdraw thexcecucyon unto
the.xxx. day after the pronuncyaco^n of the sentence / to the end that he may
know if the same sentence be Justly or wyckedly given. This law thus made /
saint Ambrose gaaf to the said Emperor his absolucyon. And that done he
suffered him to enter in to the church. In which he entered not vpryght but
proste^ned and flat to the ground upon the pament. And began to say with
the psalmyste Lord god my tongue clyue to my chekys / please if the to
quyckene me after thy word. And in taking his head with his two hondes
rendynge his heeres and wetynge the pament of the church with great
habundaunce of teeres / demanded humbly pardonne and mercy of our savior
Ihesu christ. And the hour comen for to go to the offryng made his oblacyon in
great wepynges and wayl lynges. And after that he set him down in the quyre
or ^hore like as he tofore had be accustomed The which thing seeing Saint
Ambrose asked him what thing he made there. To whom humbly he answered / that
he intended to receive the holy sacrament of the altar. And anon after Saint
Ambrose did do say to him by an Archedeken that the chore or the quyre of
the church was oonly ordained for the priests. And that it was not leeffull
to other to enter in to it / commaundynge him that he should go out abydyng the
percepcyon of the precious body of Ihesu Christ with the other. Theodosius
herynge these words / mekely answered thus. I am not set here by presumpcyon
/ but for as ^oche as in Constantynople the custom is such that the Emperor
/ when the service of god is in doing sytteth in the chore or quyre with the
priests. And in his excusacyon thus made / he issued in thankyng humbly Saint
Ambrose of his good exhortacyon. By which example may be known the great
Justice of that one and of that other. How be it / that I have great meruaylle
of the great hardynes of Saint Ambrose toward the said Emperor. And also of
the obeyssau^ce of him. In which thou have matere to take good example of the
ends tofore alleged. And therefore I pray the that often thou read this
hystorye / And if thou so do puttyng it in effect / thou shall eschew all
vices and sins / the which thing nevertheless thou may not do without
the specyalle aid and help of our savior and redemer Ihesu Christ / as says
Saint Johan in his first gospel / spekyng in the person of our lord Ihesu
Christ saying thus. Without me ye may do no good thing that is merytorye.
Then ought not the strong man to gloryfye himself in his strength ne the
wise man in his wysedom / ne in like wise the rich man in his richesse / but
they ought to gloryfye them in the knowleche of god / as he him self says in
speaking by the mouth of the prophet Iheremyas. And to this purpose says
saint Poull in one of his Epystles speaking to the Corynthyens. My brethren /
he that will gloryfye late him gloryfye in god and nothing in him self / the
which words ben well to be noted pryncypally by them that mayntene yt a man
may conduyte and govern his propre will without help of god / which we
ought not to believe. For if we may not without him think any thing / by more
gretter reason we may do no thing without him. And therefore if thou do any
good work / presume not that it proceeds of the / but of god which has
given to the his grace to do and accomplysshe it.

How one ought gladly read the scryptures / beginning in latin. Sanctarum etc
Caplm.xv.
TO read the scryptures / is in party to know the felycyte eternal. For in
them a man may see what he ought to do in conuersacyon. Also that lightly he
may see his face in a myrrour. Often to read purges the soul from sin / it
engenders dread of god / and it keeps the soul from eternal dampnacyon. And
all in like wise as we be nourysshed with bodily mete as touching the body. In
like wise as touching the soul we ben nourysshed by the lecture and redynge of
scripture. To this purpose s^^^^ psalmyste. My god that thy words ben sweet to
mine eeres to here and to understand. But yet is he more happy which redeth
the scryptures / and does that which he fyndeth therein. For they be made to
the end / that in knowing them we may live in this world well and Justly.
And as it is said that the blind byhoueth often more on his way / than he that
sees much clear. In like wise well often he that knows not the law of god
synneth / there as he that knows it synneth not. And a man without a techer /
is as a blind man without a leder. And therefore be dylygent and besy to read
the scryptures. For in redyng them the naturell wit and understanding ben
augmented in so much that men find that which ought to be left / and take
that whereof may ensyewe prouffyte Infenyte. And also he shall find in them
what he ought to do.

Of the yefte of peace / beginning in latin. Saluator etc. Capittulum.xvi.
THe yefte of peace the which among all other is sovereign / left our lord
Ihesu Christ to his appostles / when he ascended in to heaven the day of his
ascencyon to the right side of god ye fader in saying to them. I give to you
my peace. I have left to you peace / and so shall I find you again. And this
yt he gaaf to them / that is to say peace / he desires to find again at ye
day of dome in every christian man. And he himself shows to us in an other
place of the gospel ye goods of peace where he says Blessed be the peasyble /
for he that is very peasyble in his conscience is the sone of god / but he that
has no peace in his heart is the sone of the devil. And this we ought to
understand of very peace / which is oonly in the conscience of ryghtfull men.
For the evil persons have peace with their felawes but in their conscience
they have it not. The first peace brings and ledeth to saluaco^n / the
second to dampnacyon. Peace is with ye good and virtuous / and war is with ye
evil and vycyous / peace is cause of the receyuyng of the holy ghoost. Peace is
mother of love and dylecco^n / peace is sign of holiness / of ye which says
the prophet. Love ye peace and veryte. Peace is the health of the people / the
great honor of the prince / the Joy of the contree / and the dread of
enemies. Then it ought always to be kept / for who is with it is with god.
Thoffyce of a priest is to admoneste the people of ye which they ought to do.
And the people ought to here humbly. For ye herdeman ought to deffende his
sheep from all things unjust. And ye people ought to be to him obeyssau^t.

Here follows ye pystle of saint Macharye to monks / which begins in
latin. In primis etc. Caplm xvij
IF a man know well what he is / and what is his maker / and he will repent
hy^ of his sins in making devout penance / as fastings / abstyne^ces /
almesses or other good deeds / and that he have in hate all voluptuousyte and
bodyly pleasau^ce / god shall give to hy^ very contryco^n and parfyght
knowleche of his offenses / in so much yt he shall see the tronke or beme in
his owen eye / and shall not see ye festue in the eye of his neighbor / yt is
to wit yt he shall know his great sins / and not ye small of his neighbor.
Then may he well say with ye psalmyste. Lord god I know ye enormyte of my
sin / which is co^tynuelly in thy presence. I shall also have remembrance of
ye Judgment of haue^ and of hell / and if he see yt his heart be ferme and
constau^t in ye dread of god / without to dread his adversary ye feed of hell /
he is a very relygyous / but all in like wise as ye ship is drowned by great
habu^dance of water / in like wise a relygyous man yt possesses any goods
te^porell is drowned by sin / for he goth dyrectly against ye vow^ of relygyon
/ by ye which he auouwed wylfull pouerte. And on ye contrary a relygyous
person yt is not possessed of any thing he flees in to ye royame of heue by
co^templaco^n For ye eygle yt flees on hye above al other birds comes sooner
to the term of his course and there receives his salarye. And furthermore it
is expedyent to good relygyous to read pray and be as brethern togydre / for
in so doing ye dyffycultees ben ye sooner determined and better disputed / tha^
for testudye each by hy^self Four things ben much necessary to a man of ye
church / knowledge of ye law of god / thystory in ye which is contained ye
life to come / ye service of ye church / and ye scye^ce of gramayre / by yt
which is known ye sygnyfycaco^ns of ye terms of latin he yt has not
renou^ced ye world knows not what is of ye (...) is said in a common proverb
/ that also well by houeth to thauarycyous man yt he has as yt which he has
not. To hy^ yt trusts in god ye rychesses fayllen not. For he will not have
them / but to an evil person / all byhoueth to his appetyte / how well yt he
has many goods temporell / let us live then as having nothing / and all
possessyng by suffysau^ce. For the life and ye vesture is the richesse of
living men / if you have thy goods and thy power and domynaco^n / selle them
and give them for ye love of god / or if not take them from thy heart and
thought / if one take away thy robe or thy vesture / let him go yt has taken
it away and robbed the. For it byhoueth to give and selle his goods for to
nourysshe and sustain the poor people / he yt has given himself to god has
given all yt he has we read yt the holy saints apostles for to follow our
savior and redemer Ihesu christ leften generally all yt they hadden. And the
good wydowe yt gaaf.ij. ferthynges to thoffryng was preferred tofore the great
and excellent yeftes of Cresus. For she had more merit for as much as she
gaaf all yt she had / he lightly despyseth all thing / yt reputeth him self
ready for to deye. We ought to think on the things yt follow / that is to wit
on ye passion of our savior Ihesu christ to the end yt we have therein comfort.
On the hour of death / to the end yt we make us ready. On the day of Judgment
to the end yt we may yield good acomptes. On hell to the end yt we dread and
eschew it. And on heaven to the end that we desire it. The fend of hell
brings vain surete to the courage of man in three manners. First he admonesteth
him that he confess hy^ not in any wise of his trespaces and sins / in
saying to him yt he is yet young and that he may line always and not deye.
Secondely he admonesteth and gives hy^ to understand yt other men has more
sinned and co^mysed moo euylles than he / and nevertheless they have longer
lived than he. Thyrdly he gives to hy^ boldynes and hardynes to sin and
persevere in his euylles saying to hy^ / what someuer yt a man does sin god
yt is soueraynely pyteous and merciful shall forgive him all / and thus he
brings a man to da^pnaco^n perpetuell and to ye torments of hell. God our
savior has given diverse remedies to ye soul for to make hy^ clean and
guarysshe hy^ of his sin. For some may purge they^ by alms / other by
orysons and prays / other for to receive pylgryms / ye other by fasting and
wakyng / other for to be chaste / other by humylyte / the other by very
obeyssau^ce / some by very pacyence / some have science / ye other sapyence /
other have yt yefte of ye tongue / other have yt yefte to hele seek men / and
all these things makes ye holy ghoost / which deuydeth his graces as hy^
seems good. And if you behold well in thy psalms / you shall find
thyncarnacyon / the passion / the resurrexion / thassenco^n of our savior and
redemer Ihesu christ / and the other mysteryes of our faith. Thou shall find
therein orayson and prayer more devout than you may in thy self think with
right ample confession of thy sins / and also for to call for the mercy of
god. Thou shall find there furthermore all virtues if thou wylt that god show
them to the.

If thou wylt say a psalm well deuoutely. Say yt same yt begins. Beati
inmaculati etc. And when you shall have estudyed all thy life to understand yt
same psalm. I believe certaynely yt you sholdest not understand it. For in it
is not a verse / but it conteyneth of the law of god / or some commandment
of ye same / or words incytyng to fervent deuoco^n. And therefore it is not
necessary to demand ne inquire so many books For you have enough of the
psaulter all thy life. In which you shall find for one party the gospellys
and prophecyes / and other books diverse. And generally thou shall find if you
behold well all the operaco^ns worthy to be remembered of our savior and
redemer Ihesu christ / as it has be said here tofore. The place and habytaco^n
of our savior and redemer is an heart Just and rightful. The fondement of
the house is the faith / the heyght is hope / the bread and largenes is charity
/ the length is perseuerau^ce / the sides of the house and habytaco^n ben peace
and concord / the yates ben Justice and truth / the beauty is good example /
The wyndowes ben the sayenges of saints / the pament is humylyte of heart /
the chambres ben the good prelates / the door is the place of peace / the
couerture is loyalte / the table of Ihesu christ in this chamber is good
conuersaco^n / his service in the same is good remembrance / his rest is good
will his chair is clerenes of thought / his spouse is the soul holy and
sacred / his chambrelayns ben the virtues / his ^hyef chambrelayne is charity /
and that governs the chamber of our lord / humylyte is tresorer / holy
sapyence ensumyneth the said chamber / clennes makes clean the chamber /
bou^te brings the sweet encence therein / dylygence arayeth the chamber /
abstynence leyeth the table / attemperance keeps clennes in the conscience /
watch keeps the chamber / penance gives the dyscyplyne and chastyseth them
that have offended / good conscience and will is the portyer / the which good
will has engendered all the virtues before said. And good perseueraunce
nouryssheth them. God then give us his grace to find in us such an house
that it may please him to lodge therein / to the end that in this world he keep
us fro aduersyte spyrytuell. And in the end of our days / he bring us with him
in to his Royame of heaven for to be partyners of the glory eternal / the
which grant to us the holy trynyte Amen.

Explicit.
Thus endyth the most virtuous hystorye of the devout and right renommed
lives of holy faders living in deserte / worthy of remembrance to all well
dysposed persons / which has be translated out of Frensshe in to English
by Wyllyam Caxton of Westmynstre late deed / and fynysshed it at the last day
of his lyff. Enprynted in the said town of Westmynstre by my Wynkyn de Word
the year of our lord.M.CCCC.lxxxxv. and the tenth year of our sovereign lord
king Henry the seventh.
