I Read how affrique land was fraught
for their most filthy life,
With monstrous shapes, confuzedly
that therein were full rife.
But England now pursues their vile
and detestable path,
Embracyng eke all mischeefs great
that moves Gods mighty wrath.
As these unnatural shapes and forms,
thus brought forth in our days:
Are tokens true and manifest,
how God by diverse ways:
Does stir us to amendment of
our vile and cankred life:
Which to to much abused is,
in man, in child, and wife.
We wallow so in filthy sin,
and naught at all regard:
Nor will not fear the threats of God
till we for just reward:
Be ouerwhelmd with mischeefs great,
which ready bent for us
Full long a go decreed were,
as Scriptures does discus.
Both tender babes and eke brute beasts,
in shape disfourmed be:
Full many ways he plagues the earth,
(as daily we may see)
Thus mighty Jove, to pearce our hearts
these tokens strange does send,
To call us from our filthy life
our wicked ways t'amend.
And thus by these two children here,
forewarnes both man and wife:
How both estates ought to bewail,
their vile and wretched life.
For sure we all may be aghast,
to see these shapes unkind:
And tre^blyng fear may pearce our hearts
our God to have in mind.
For if we printed in our breast,
these signs and tokens strange:
Would make us from our sins to shrike
our lives a new to change.
But some proud boastyng Pharisie,
the parents will detect:
And judge with heaps of ugly vice
their lives to be infect.
No no, but lessons for us all,
which daily do offend:
Yea more perhaps, then has the friends,
whom God this birth did lend.
For if you will with single eye,
note well and view the text:
And mark our Saviors answer eke,
that thereto is annexed:
Where his disciples asked him,
to know therein his mind:
If greatter were the parents sins,
or his that was borne blind.
To whom Christ answered in a breef,
that neither he, nor they:
Deserved had that crooked fate,
although they sin each day.
But to the end Gods glory great,
and miracles divine:
Might on the earth apparaunt be,
his works for to define.
Such like examples moved me,
in these forgetful days:
To rue our state that us a mong,
vice bears such swings and swayes.
Wherein the goodness great of God
we way and set so light:
By such examples calling us,
from sin both day and night.
Where we do run at randon wide,
our selves flatteryng still:
And blazyng others faults and crimes,
yet we our selves most ill.
But if we do consider right,
and in even balaunce way:
The ruin great of hearty love,
among us at this day:
And well behyld with inward eyes,
th'embracyng of these Twins:
That God by them vpbraides us for
our false discemblyng sins.
We would with Niniuie repent
our former passed years,
Bewaylyng eke our secret sins
in sack cloth and in tears.
Therefore in time amend your state,
and call to God for grace:
Bewail your former life and sins,
while you have time and space.
