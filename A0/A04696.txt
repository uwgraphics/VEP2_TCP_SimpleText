The exposicion of Daniel the Prophet gathered out of Philip Melanchton /
Johan Ecolampadius / Chonrade Pellicane and out of Johan Draconite. etc. By
George Joy. A Prophecye diligently to be noted of al Emprowrs and kings in
these last days.

And now ye kings get ye understanding and knowledge / be ye taught and learned
in Gods word / ye iuges of the earth. Psalm. 2.

Serueye the lord in fear / kiss ye the son (and not images) lest he
bewrathe and ye perisshe from the way / for shortly shall his anger be kindled.
But then blesled be they all that trust unto him.

1545. In Auguste.

Unto the most clear Prince / lord Maurice Duke of Saxone / Lantgraue of
Turinge and Marchis of Misne: Philip Melanchton whissheth health.
WHen I addressed me to write this exposicion upon Daniel / I remenbred the
halcyons days. For they say that in the most sharp Halcyon is a kingis
fissher.
and coldest time of the year / these halcions making their nestisin the sea
rockis or sandis / will sit their eggs and hatcheforth their chikens. And
therefore the same sea that harbors these fowls thus sitting upon their
eggs / will be so cawme and still to her geistis for. 14. days / that men may
sewerly sail without perel upon her / not shaken nor molested with any storm
or tempeste / nor yet the nestis of these birds so nighe the water not once
shaken nor hurt with any sourges. For the seas will not for that time of these
birdis sitting and hatching / (...) her geistis. And therefore is this
tranquilite of the sea for that little time / as a ^rwce taking in the winter /
called the halcions days. But now to my purpose. As God has setforth in
natural creatures many images and faces of his church / eue^ so unto me
reading the hole descripcion of these birds / it has been oftyn put in mind
of ye church yet nesteling in these troublouse cold days / as it were in the
sea / that is, in great troublouse empyres and kyngdoms. In which for a
certain little ceason / god has given both house / as were a neste / and also
some tra^quilite unto godly studies / that the gospel might be preached / red
herd / and for. 14. days rested upon / for some chosen chyke^s and faithful
birdis of Christ there to be forth hatched and fethered. Siche halcion days had
the ^ews for that little time whylis Joan Bapt. preached / and whyls Christ and
his apostles taught and preched them penance and the kingdom of heaven to be at
hand. For except / for some little ceason there had been peace and rest /
nether might the voice of the gospel have had be^ spread abroad nor ye yougth
taught and brought up therein / norany company gathered into any church. Which
thigs to be done it is not possible / whiles by the terrible troublouse
rustling toharnes and batail / and for the barberouse fyerce furye of these
soldyers / honest societies and congregacions be scatered / godly preching
cessed / cities and towns ouerthrone and bre^t / no scoles holden / ^or place
quiet for childern and ignorant persons to be taught. Namely when the babes be
plukt from their mothers bosoms / and laddes out of their fathers hands to be
slain. These thingis when ye se done / the^ let us lament and a knowelege the
wrath of God powered forth against the sins of mankind. But yet the immense
mercy and goodness of God / at some certain ceason gives a little breathing
space to his church / making the fyerce seas cawme for a little time, lest
they should let the halcio^s to hatcheforthe their chike^s. For because therefore
/ that God has given us in this region a little quyetnes / as it were the
halcions. 14. days rest / whiles the gospel might shine forth: let us render
to him thankis / and with very godly prayers ask tranquilite and peace, that
namely ye youghth might be godly brought up and taught: and also that honest
and godly gouerners and techers might govern and defend the disciplyne. For all be it great difficulties and many sharp storms have evermore grated upon
the church to exercise her faith / yet do experience show us / and God before
did speak it, The last old age of the world to be miche The last days be
perellous.
more miserable and sorrowful then the former ages. Nether / trwly / be these
prediccio^s and prophecies setforth in vain. For God would have them read, that
the godly hertes might prepare them selves unto the manyfold perels and batails
/ learn which is the very church of God / in which the voice of the gospel
of the sone of god sown / they might know that same to be the church which
shall fight with the ennemies of christ / which by his death has for us apeaced
the wrath of the eternal father / and now risen reigns to glorify his
church with life everlasting. They might know that these sorrowful miserable
calamitis shall have an end / even then / when the church stered up ayene
from death shall be beutifyed with glory everlasting. Of these thingis
forasmiche as God himself very largely premonissheth us in this book written of
Daniel / and has constituted even the ordir of the times and ages / apointing
in a manner the very limits and bowndes of the world / sewerly the reading of
this book must nedis be profitable to good Cap. 12.
men. Also the aungel himself in the end of this book exhorts this last age
to this lesson where he says. Daniel thou shall stand in thy course or lotte
into the end / that is. Thou shall do this office. Thou shall teache and
confirm the godly. And christ himself does not only deduce us unto the reading
of this book / but also commands us attentyuely to consider of how weighty
and great things Daniels prophecye techeth us / saying / whosoever read it / let
him take heed / which saying gretely moves us to read this book the gladlyer
with the more diligence. Besydis this / it is ye very brief co^pendious some
and reherceall of the storye A monarchy is one empire over all the world.
of the hole world / even from the first monarchye to the last / setting
before our eyes the clear examples of the good and euilprinces and rulers.

Of the profit of this book / it shall be spoken more here aftir. But to inuyte
all men unto the reading of Daniel / I have added brief notes. For the sayingis
of the prophets be so plentuouse that thet cannot be all at once out drawn.
Wherefore al be it these my bare and sclender co^mentaris be not able to
satisfy the amplitude of ye matter / yet it profits to put men in mind of
the chief matters / and as it were with my finger to point them to those places
which the diligent readers being studiouse / may by their own meditacion
afterward turn to / and behold them nyerer. There be verily in Daniel many
stories which require an interpretor. And in these / I think my labor to
profire the yougth. Which my labors I permit to the judgment of the godly
and learned / which shall judge of this my book both iently and lovingly. And
because it is como^ly used to dedicate bokis to princes and rulers / which
usage may have many probable and grave causes, My mind is to dedicate unto you
(most noble prince) this my labor and little book / that when I hear your good
will towerd the church of christ and to honest studies, to be praised / I
would therefore declare also this your vertewe unto the students / exhorting
them to love and reverence godly princes / and in their prayers commend them
with their commons unto God. Great is the infirmite of man / greter is the fury
of the devil / which brening in the hatered of god / as he thrusted out our
first parents to fall into these miserable sorouful calamities / even so
studieth he perpetually to hurt Crystes chirch. And chiefly he lays awaite
at the higheste head thereof / and of our life: nether is there any so great
wisdom which can well perceive how great perel there is in every governance
and regiment.

Wherefore all princes conioined unto the church of God / ought with the
prayers of all faithful to be helped / that God which gives health unto kings
would once rule their counsess and bow their minds and their enforcements unto
their own and to the publik saving health. Of this thig the readers should be
monisshed in this kind of dedicacions. For the reding of noble and clear
examples / should exhort the same princes themselves unto modesty moderacio^ /
and to pity / not to slaye ^oho^ so ever the adversaries of god would have
killed / but to fere God. Which examples / for this end has God set before
their eyes / to call them and their posterite to the study and scole of vertew.
I there fore beseech God hertely the father of Ie su Christ our delyuerer to
preserve you / and so to govern you / that your governance be happy and
prosperouse to you / to your country / and to the church of christ / even the
very true comonaltie of all. So be it. In the Calends of January. 1545.

The argument or matter contained in Daniel the Prophet by Philip Melanchton.
MAny mighty and profitable thigis worthy to be depely reposed into good
myndis Daniel comprehe^deth which all to peruse and express / owr to
skantlitle wits be not able. Netheles let every diligent reder know himself
miche to have profited / if he but the chief prin^ipalls understand / although
it be but meanly: and use the same unto his own godly exercise: Considering
which part techeth him the true invocation and worship of god and which
confirms his faith / which re^iecteth and refuteth the jews, and us castinge
away god and his gospel as they did: which part precheth to us repentance /
and which even now monissheth and warns us in time, of these last perellous
days and blody end of this world. For these causes shall I recite briefly /
as it were the titles herein contained, which shall show you what vtilite shall
come to you by reding this holy book and divine Prophet.

First think you thus of the hole book. That the story of Daniel is a
testimony of the preseruacion of the church beutified destroy all criste^dom.
But Jeremy knew full w^ll these things both to come to pass / that the people
of god should be chastised by an haithen king / and yet at that time / nether
the regale famylie nor the stok of Judah to be extincted nor the trwe prophets
to fail and b^wanted. And even so it came to pass beyond al menis expectacio^
/ when few or non knew thereof. For the kingly stok eue^ in the babylon^
captivity had their honor / where god stered up prophets and orned his church
with great glory, yea and even the haithen gentiles did he adioyne unto the
fellowship of his own church / so that there was then a gloriouse conversion
of the haithen unto God / as I pray God there may be of the turks and jews
once unto owr true christian religion.

Secondarily ye shall observe the testimonis of Messiah owr king Christ. For his
finger / even whiles yet the comonweale of the jews should en, Christ should be
borne and suffer / and also when their ceremonial shawdews and sacrifices all
should cease.

Thirdely ye shall note the order / of the.

Fowerthly ye shall note the places of repentance / of faith / and of the
iustificacion

Fyftely / ye shall note the examples of good and evil kingis.

Sixtely consydere the testimony of

Seventhly there is given v^ a forwarning of Crystes verite / and the
persecution of the church dispersed and vanished into sundry strange londis,
porely there living, under kings em^ and rulers, which, with cruelty defend
idollatry, supersticion and false religion. And in so great confusion among
sundry nations / sundry sectis shall arise bolstred up by manis wit and
reason, concerning gods worship, invented by man and the iustificacion by
workis etc. Agenst which profane fantasies and idle imaginacions we must lern
in the gospel / god to be worshipped in spirit / and faith only in christ to
iustifye. Against the epicures that deny the resurreccion / and souls to be
immortal / here we have a clear testimonye of the resuscitation of the dead to
come, where the ungodly shall be punysshed with payns perpetual / and the godly
endewed with joy eternal. The professors of this doctrine shall arise again
unto life. By the doctrine of christ / of the prophets / and apostles,
professed and received / the trwe church is (...) from the Synagog of
anticryst. Here it is taught also the church not to be the most multitude /
but often to be but a little miserable sort afflic with poverty, preso^s, and
persecucion with many other calamities / and the wyked enemies of god for the
more part to bear rule / to be emprours and kings, popes, cardinals, bisshops
etc. And to have the wealthy vayn glory of this world. But when these vtwarde
apperances offend manis reason / which being ignorant of the wrath of God
against sin / yet cleaving in the nature of man / dreameth these rulers rather
to be beloved of God to whom he gives victory / impery, riches, and rule:
therefore it is necessary to note this premoni cion, teaching us how we should
know the church of God / where we should seek it / even only in that
congregation which receives and enbraceth with perel of their lives the
doctrine delivered by the prophets / by Christ and his apostles. And let not
the (...) / kings / rulers nor riches nor their gloriouse titles / nor the
multitude / nor long customs / nor the holy names of their holy mother the
church move the to esteem them for the people of god, which either castaway /
neglecte or (...) the universal doctrine of the prophets and apostles / orels
openly and pertinatly defend imagis, supersticion vain ryts / idle
ceremonies, and Papistrye. Here also thou seeste the anticrystis both seculare
and spiritual prophesied to come in the second and third but especially in
this last Monarchy / where in they shall most cruelly towerds the end of the
world grievously persecute and resist the gospel / here (I say) ar these
adversaries to crist lively setforth i^ their own colors and as it were with
Daniels finger pointed forth: and also / how / wherewithe / and when they
shall be destroid. Men must be prudent in dividing and receiving the prophets
documents. They must look which part contains the laws / which preche the
promises and the gospel. For unto these principalls allother things must be
referred. Note also which part declares the documents. As what can be said
clerelyer and euide^tsier against the jews / then that Daniel af firmeth christ
to must have had been borne during yet the common weal of Moses? Wherefore that
horrible destruccio^ of jerusalem and ruin of the hole land of Judah now
paste. 1474. years / do testify christ to be borne / and it refuteth their
mad and cursed pertinacye. Here must we note the lessons of the trwe
inuocacion and worship of God. As when Daniel prays / he aknowlegeth to God
only his own and their sins for whom he prays / and asks of God only
delyuerance in the faith and confidence of his mercy / adding by express
name, For the lord christ his sake / that is for Messiah his sake promised.
This form of prayer with confidence of the mercy of God promised for crystes
sake / we ought to use in these last and perlous days: now be we taught who be
the church and therewith monisshed to fly and * that false colored company
that contend to blot out the name and glory of christ / defend their images
supersticiouse rites, cere. and papistry against the gospel / under the name of
the church or of any other begged glitering gay titles.

Nether ought this thing to be neglected / that to confirm our myndis / God
the scripture is Gods word.
has given us prophecies of all sorts concerning the externe kingdo^s / so
that by the just fulfilling of every thing / as it was prophesied / we have
trwe testimonys that owr scripture is Gods word / and no another but this owr
faith, to be the trwe faith also. And that we should be warned and told when
christ shall come and when we must look for the end of the world. And when we
see althingis to have had come to pass / and be fulfilled which were
prophesied / then we should believe even these same also to be likewise fulfilled
which yet this day the scriptures testify to come orels we se them present.
Which prophecies the cl^resyer to be vnderstande^ / it is necessary we know
the ages of the world and the order of the. 4. Monarchies / and the nowmber of

But because only Daniel prophecieth of the. 4. high Monarchies of the world

destroyed the kingdom of the jews for breking his. 10. co^mandeme^ts: and agene
so mercifully acordig to his promises he preserved Daniel with his felows
ende^owring al wais to keep his precepts. In this glass we behold god both
almighty and merciful by kiges and prophets so to govern yt world / that
they wc will not believe the prophets and trwe prechers (as did the jews
conte^pne Ieremye) must with out mercy be destroid by the kings and at last by
the turk acording to his threatenings in the law: but they that believe God
rules the world by kings and prophetis.
his prophets (as did Daniel and his felows, believe Jeremy) shall be mercifully
preserved by the kiges and eue^ under the turk to / according to his promises.
Let us therefore believe the doctrine of the prophets and prechers, preching the
law and gospel / lest with the edged sword of the kings and turk the
servants and ministres of God / we b'e slain with the ungodly jews / but
rather contend by faith to be conserved with Daniel acording to Gods promises.
He cannot lve which says / I am the strong and zelouse God, the visitour and
seker out of the wykednes of the fathers in their childern, unto the third and
fowerth generation. But yet am I merciful into thousandis that love me and keep
my preceptis.

In this Chapter / it is showed how that Daniel with his felows taken in
batail, were brought into the kigs court of Babylon / and there liberally
brought up, so that they became very apt and able to govern the common weal:
which story co^teineth first a clear example of the divine providence, and
then an example of the holy and liberal educacion of young men.

The first Chapter.
In the third year of the reign of Ioachim king of the jews / Nebuchadne *
king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. And the lord yilded up
Ioachim king of the jews into his handis and also certain of the vessels and
jewels of the house of god, which he carrying away with him into the land of
Babylon into the house of his god / did set them up in the tresure house of
his God.

The first place contains the wrath of god and punisshement of wykednes ^
ungodliness according to the comminacions of god / begin at the examples of the
wrath of God / that is / at the greuouse calamite and miserable captivity of
the king and his subjects / the destruction of their chief cite Jerusalem /
burning of their noble temple for their idollatry and breking of his preceptis,
which miserable calamitouse captivity and deadly desolacion ar described in
the. 4. of the kingis. 24. cap. and in the last of the cronicles called
Paralipomenon. Hitherto therefore tends the hole storye of Daniel. note this
well good reader.
That as the jews with their common well, were so miserably destroyed and led
into captivity by gods minister Nebucad ne king of Babylon for despysing the
preching of Ieremye, and slaying his prophets, teaching them the law and gospel
and warning them of that their pla ge to come over them: even so shall all the
christian realms at last for thrusting away the gospel offered them and
sleying the trwe pechers sent them of God / be likewise miserably destroyed and
captuied of the turk: so that first by mutual and civil batails among
themselves one destroing other / they make the way more easy and ready for the
turk to invade and overcome all cristendome. And wherefore shall God do thus to
his people? Because 22. Cap.
(says Ieremye) they have casten up the covenant of their own God and
worshipped strange Gods. Unto the which sentence Daniel subscribeth saying / we
have 9. Cap.
not obayed the prophets, the servants of God.

In the land of Sennaar / that is in Gene. 7. Of babylon city.
the lord of ye caldes / in a great plain was Babylon builded in process of
time mightily and strongly augmented with rich palaces, pleasant howses /
strong walls, and towers called the head cite and empire of all the world so
celebrated, and standing inuicte with many gloriouse victories by the space of.
1495. years / having the hole world under their dominion. It was builded in. 4.
square. 60. thousand pa over from wall to wall / the wall is. 200. foot high /
and. 500. foot broad. And yet was every foot longer by. 3. fyngers then owers.
It was in circuit without the vttwarde wall is. 480. forlongs. It was dowble
walled with many high and strong towrets. And by a meruelouse craft and
labor / the floude euphrates was brought to run rownde about it / betwixt /
and without the walls and through many places of the cite. It is so described
of the ancient historye writers / as of Iosepho / Plinio / Herodoto / Orosio
as no cite else to be like it. But this so mighty a city and golden head / when
the king Balthazar with his nobles were festing and banketing in the night in
most securite / for that they thought their cite to be inexpugnable. Then came
king Cyrus and laid siege to Babylon / he dug up the banks of euphrates
and turned the flowd clean from the cite / so that with out perell he might
with his host enter it / and then having the king of Babylon in siche
dro^kenes and securite he slew him and took the cite. In that cite yet (as it
is left) there remains the temple of Jupiters image, called Bele the fynder
of the syderall science / or^ls is there no another memorial Amonicion
or skant any vestigie thereof. Of the soden fall of that so strong a cite /
so mighty and clear an Empire and noble Monarchye or golden head as God
described it / let all kings and em this day described by the pot ba earth and
frail fete, divided among themselves in to. 10. erthentoes / beware and take
ensample. For Cyrus and the Turk the ministers of God / ar at hand / even the
very instruments of godis wrath punisshing the wyked ungodliness of al
crystendom. For it was the lord (says Daniel) that yielded up the king / the
city / the temple, and the holy vessels thereof into Nebucadnezers handis to be
set in the temple of the devil. And yet is not God the author of evil / for
worthily punisshing sin in hardening impenite^t hertes* as he did Pharaos
heart.

Wherefore if men will be wise and warned in time / let them fere God,
constituting heithen kings as was Nebucadne^ / and now is the turk, to
punisshe sin / lest by these examples of the wrath of God according to his
comminacions we be destroid of evil kings and of the turk / Peter writes /
the destruction of Sodoma to be prescribed unto their posterite 2. Pet. 2.
for an example / and the same example let us here take at the jews. And pray
to our father that he lede^ us not into temptacion / but deliver us from that
evil. For if he spared not his own natural branches the jews (says Paul)
beware Romans 11.
lest he spares not us unnatural branches / but serve us as he dealt with
his own people.

Then the king commanded Asphenaz Text.

prophesying their captivity because they custe away the covenant of the lord,
and worshipped strange gods. Also of Ioiakim here mentioned he said he should be
buried like an ass / casten out of ye gatis of Jerusalem. Let us therefore fere
the iugeme^ts and wrath of God and abhor ungodly worshipings and other
greuouse blasphemouse crimes. For if god spared not that Romans 11.
people to whom he gave so excellent giftis and ample promises / miche less
shall he spare us. The promises were meruelously performed of God in preseruinge
his own faitheful as Daniel with his felows above manis expectacion. And again
the wiked grievously punisshed according to Gods comminacions in thelawe. And
therefore Jeremy rebukes the fond vain hope of the ungodly which so wrested
the promises unto this end / that they denied any siche plages to come over
them saying: tiuste not in these lying prophets sermons / saying we have the
temple / the temple of the lord so holy etc. And again when Hananias falsely
prophesied the jews to return aftir. 2. yeris from babylon and did break the
chains which Jeremy carried / Jeremy blamed him addinge / hananiam the same
year to dye because he spoke against the lord / and even so it came to pass.
Of this story it apereth the false prechers then to have been in the most high
auctorite / for they bosted and blewforth pleasant promises out of their own

even for that he wills the godly to aknowlege their sins and so to take

and therefore am I taught (says Iere. 31.) as men break young coltes and

brig it to pass above our asking and understanding. And thus had the faithful
people more glory in their exile the^ at home / for they had with them many

the trw religion of god. And the kings stok of Judah was there conserved and
entertained regally. Wherefore this promise was not void.

The scepter shall not be taken away etc. Genesis 49
But yet did god perform his promises far otherwise the^ the false or trwe
prophets thought it. Let us here therefore learn in our affliccions and troubles
to hold fast our faith and calvpon god, abiding pacie^tly his help,
although it come not to pass aftir owr imaginacions but as it is disposed and
governed of godis counsel. Let us be instant and fervent in prayer / for the
prayer of the humble afflicted shall not go from God / as it is written. Also it
is to be noted. That God long differred this extreme and last plage of the
jews at that time and all to inuit them to repentance / as Jeremy preched it
to them. But when the ungodly thought themselves in great securite, to have

and soden destruction camouer them. Now as touching the third and other
places of this first chapter / kings be taught to moderate their victoryes /
and not utterly to desi^roie all / but to constitute a beter order setting all
things in a beter state / preserving the good and learned men / as did
Nebuccadne preserve Jeremy and the king with the most multitude of the people.
Hitherto pertains the precept of clemencye and mercy for kings / which is to
do well to the good men decerning the good and learned from the evil and
unlearned / and to moderate the punisshements of the tractable and curable / and
to suppress the obstinate incurable. For mercy and verite keep the king, and
with clemency is his trone sustained and borne up. Also here be prices taught
their office, to se diligently Prou. 20
/ that their subjects be learned the word of God and other craftis and coning
arts etc. necessary for a common weal. It is testified here and confirmed the
precept deu. 17. co^ma^ding the king alwais to hold the book of the law of god
in his ha^dis that he might read it and learn therein. Wherefor kings ought
to procure diligently siche learned and godly me^, of who^ they should learn /
who also should tech other: and even hitherto pertains the saying of I say.
49. even the kings to be ye nources of their people / that is kings to nouresh
up, maintayn, and defend the prechers and techers of the chirches and schools,
and not to destroy, burn, banishe, and command them to silence. Oh how
highly is king ezechias praised for restoring the studies and scoles of the
priests. Wherefore al princes ought to know, God to require of them straightly
this office. 2. Paral. 31.
The jews persecuted their own Prophets / but now the haithen king
nourissheth them: and received great benefits of God for so doing. For he was
by them converted unto the trwe religion and had a flouresshing kingdom for
these good me nis sakes. For god largely recompenseth this kind of office
according to his own promise / whosoever gives but a draft of water to any one of
my preachers he shall have Mat. 10.
his reward. But contrary / the tyra^ts which despise, moleste, and persecute
the godly prechers / studies and scoles / they shall be plaged with horrible
punishments To this study of godly prices pertains 1. Pet. 3.
that peter commandethe, Every man to be redye to give a rekening of his faith
and to satisfy whosoever asks him there Titu. 3.
of / and Paul commands Titum, that the people learn to excess in good workis
unto uses necessary so that they be not unprofitable. At last ye se Daniels
temperancye to have been the work of his lawful profession commanded in the
law and not the tradicion of man / nor yet his own chosen holiness or religion /
he would not defile himself with the haithe^ kings forboden meats to avoid the
company and rites of the gentiles. Also Daniel being in the kings court /
nether for threats nor for contempt / or pleasure / nor by power would hebe
ouercomen or tempted once to swerve from the trwe worship, word, and fere of
god / no not for promocio^ / which thing will not owr spiritual courtyers do.
Look ye therefore of Daniels co^stancye / his faith and tempera^cie and follow
it / if ye will with Daniel be godly promo^. For they that glorifye me / I
shall glorifye them says the lord. 1. samuel. 2. And they that despise me / I
shall abhor and with shame confound them The godly how they shall do in time
of peace and batel. Eze. 18.
The godly therefore in time of peace hear the prophets and prechers / that is /
they fear the comminacions of God and believe his promises / wherefore when they
be punisshed with the ungodly (as men in perel both in one ship) they
despeier not but they confess their sins to God pronowncing him to be just.
And because God says / as verily as I live / I wilnot ^ death of a sinner but
had ^r him to be converted and live / a non they erecte themselves by his
promises against his comminacions Faith erect^th hirself up bithe ^mises ayenste
the threats.
/ they call upon him / they be herd / and helped / as ye se it in the example
of Daniel and his felows in this Chapter. For they be as sewer as god lives
and reigns / that he will keep promise with the^ that repent and believe his
promises ^herfor they prescribe not yt time nor place nor manner to god in
fulfilling his promises with We may not poit God the time pla ce etc.
them as do the ungodly / but against all hope and trust they hope and believe
as did Abraham / and they preche as did Abacu^ saying. God will fulfill his
promise. This example therefore techeth us manifestly trwthe it to be that Paul
says, God to be mighty enoughe to bring althings to pass above our estimacion

time of peace deryde and co^tempne the prechers of the gospel, and hear the
prophets of the devil preching his and their own false doctryn / boldly
affirmig those co^minacio^s of ye trw prophets to be vain / because god
promised ye scepter of Judah not to be taken from the^ / and as we promise o^r
selves victory against the turk because we be crystened and call upon holy

church The fast and punisshement of the false prechers

(as thou here seist him) yea although he punisshe the ungodly as it is before
said. For it is the sin of the false Prophetis being ignorant of the nature
and difference of the law and Gospel / that make the ungodly in time of peace
to contemn and skorne out, the word of God and so to fall from God in time of
batail. And even the blood of all these contemners of Gods word now perisshed

Wherefore Ieremye well dehorted and dissuaded the people saying: Se that ye

Here is Nebuchadne ^^^^ dream The argnme^t of the 2. ca.
declared / which Daniel interprets of the. 4. Monarchies which shall be
destroid at the coming of crystes kingdom.
IN this chapter God conforteth his captiued jews / and ens^ructeth the king
unto the kingdom of heaven. He comforts the^ in that he glorifieth Daniel
showing Messiah to come in / and aftir the fowerth Monarchy. He enstructeth
the king in that he confounds his wise men, the preistis, and dream tellers
in de claring christ to pertain unto the gentiles / but so that first / the
wysedo^ of those worldely polityk preistis be proved all folisshnes.

In the second year of Nebucadnezar / Text.
he himself saw a dream / whereby his spirit gretely afraid / he awaked. Then
he called together his astronimers, encha unters* and the sothe sayers in all
caldye to tell him and interpret his dream etc.

Now God reueleth in an ordir the. 4 Monarchis / witnessing that in the end
consolacion and a doctrine set before the people / for they did now se
themselves not forsaken of God in that they had soche Prophets as was Daniel
one. They learned also when that perpetual glory promised to their fathers /
should be looked fore. B^sydis this / the king and many other gentyles by this

In these first fowr places are contained three examples / that is to wete /
two of the mercy of God declared upon the king and on Daniel / and one example
of the wrath of God showed upon the wise men of the world. The king
Nebucadnezar studied and mused what should come of his realm and of the hole
world: wherefore God created him a dream whereby he should be certifyed what /
and how many kyngdoms should before come, even unto the everlasting kingdom of
Christ / for God would in this dream show Christ to the king and to his
haithen realm, because he had before sworn it by a sacred oath unto the sead
of Abraham now captiued in the same realm of Babylon / saying: By my nownself
Genesis 22.
swear I / that in thy sead shall I bless all nations. Wherefore / that this
king and nowrce of Christ might know the Babyloni religion to be deuillisshe
/ and the Jews religion to be Goddis true religion / he makes the king to
forgete his dream / smytyng yet into his mind so deep a dreadful desyer to
know it that not only all the wise sothe sayers and dream tellers of Babylon
/ but also even Daniel with his felows he would co^mande to be slain onelesse
they could It behooves the victor to feel what captives he has 1. Samu ^l. 5
and 6.
declare and show him his dream. For as it behooved the Philisteins to have
had experience what a geste they had of the ark of God / even so it behooved
the victore king to know what manner men he had in captivity: but yet with more
mercy then pharo felt what gestis he had of the same sead. The wise enchaunters
preistis and sothe sayers of Babylon ar the example of the wrath of God. For
they bosted and craked religiously dreams to be showed and declared of God and
themselves to have the coning to declare them / If ye have this craft to
interpret my dream as ye profess it (says the king) so may ye as well
have the co^ning of your goddis to tell me what I dreamed. But seeing that ye
cannot tell me my dream / ye declare yourselues worthei to be convicted as
very liars and foles / according as says I say. God co^foundeth the wise in
their own craftye subtylite the lord knowth how vain ar the studies and
thoughts of the worldly wise me^ for in that they denied any man to may show
that dream / they took away the providence of god and denied the religion of
the jews / that is to say the law and god how he is with men.
the gospel by the which means God is cenuersant with men and reueleth his
mysteries. Wherefore the king justly threateneth I say. 29
them death / according to that saying. I will destroy the wysedom of the wise.
For this is of a trwthe / God will first shame, destroy, and confound the
false religion and the wise politic prudent mayntayners thereof, before he
reuelethe and brings in his gospel and trwe doctrine. And as the polityk
prudent sent the word of god reveled shameth man nis doctrine seem it never so
dece^t and laudable.
their spies before to vewe the lord of canaan concey* a fear and a despaier
never entredin them selves but rather despaiered of Gods promise / even so
shall these politik wise in so great laysour taking, casting so many perels of
sedicions and tumulte if the gospel offered should be spedely received / never
have it nor never enter into the kingdom thereof. For whosoever observes the
clouds and wether shall never sow nor reap. Eccle. 11.

Daniel and his felows ar the example of the mercy of God. For therefore would
God / that the king and victore should threaten death to Daniel captiued / that
he should be constrained to call upon god and so through his inuocacion the
dream should be known openly into the co^solacion of the church captiued, and
into the conversion of the gentiles unto christ / for whom and by whom only all
things be done.

When Daniel knew the decree Text.
of the king and that sentence was given the wise dream tellers to be slain /
and that Daniel and his fellows were sought of Arioch the shryue to be slain.
Then Daniel took ye matter in hand and said to the shryue. etc.

This is an example of faith in God almyghtye as has the first article of
our Credo. For as Abraham above all Romans 4.

almighty / so does Daniel here by faith pro myse himself to find out the
dream which was impossible to all ye wise men all things be possible to God.
of the world. For as no promise of God is impossible to be fulfilled / so ar
all his promises possible to him that believe the^. Because therefore he knew
God to calforth that * is not / to make it in deed (whatsoever god says it is
done) with great confidence Daniel in the perel of death / condemns the kings
cry / and promises the interpretacion of his dream with a joyful Gospel or
tidings to them all / by which promise he so broke the kings wrath / and
returned his sword into the sheathe which should have slain them / that he
may be well nowmbred among them of whom says the scripture. The holy
faithful through faith over came kingdoms, but how* verily by faith Heb. 11.
as it folowthe. Text.


Then went Daniel home and showed his felows Hananias Misael Asaryas the matter*
praying them to prayefor the grace and gift of God celestial in this secret
hyde thing, lest they with the wise me^ of babylon be notquartered into pieces /
which done, This secret mystery was reveled to Daniel in a vision by night /
and the^ dani. did laud and praise yt god of heaven saying The name of god be

This was the Persy Monarchy and the Medis empire / signified by the silver

show it in the 5 chapter. How it was governed ye shall see in the 6 cap. and in
the eleventh how long it endured.

And then shall there be the third Text.

This is the monarchye of great Alexander and of his mighty co^federed

Daniel divides this descripcion into three express signs. First he says in
his feet and toes of and earth, there shall remain as it were under the sole,

divided and dispersed into Germanye / England / Spain / France and Turkye

and partly erthen / to signify the To mane empire after his first strength

and inuicte emprowrs and of other weak and ouerthrone. Thirdly he says. They
shall be mixed together / but yet shall they not cleave to / no more then may be
welled together with a potsherd. And this signifies as has the text. They
shall seek confederacions and affinities by blood consanguinitie in maryages /
and all in vain. As ye se it / for albeit em. and kings have joined together
in maryages with their daughters and sons / yea and with holy sacred oaths in
lege / the host broken and divided betwixt them / yet has one invaded and
destroyed other. They shall be confedered to make a new and all one Monarchye /
but all in vain / for this is the last empire to be destroyed at the last day
/ and is yet in destroyinge for resistyng and persecutynge Gods word / whether
it be the seculare or Ecclesiasti / particulare or universal empire or
kingdom.

For in the time of these kings / Text.
the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed / nether
shall this kingdom be delivered unto any other people / which kingdom and

And thus has the mighty great Text.
God showed the (o king) what is to come. For certain is this dream / and
trwe is the interpretacion there of. etc.

As Daniel was certain the dream and interpretacion thereof to be of God / so
ought every precher, teacher and writer to be sewer their doctrine to be of God
as Peter says: If any man speak 1. Pet. 4.
let him be sewer to speak the words of God. When Daniel had thus interpreted
the kings dream he honored and reverenced him with gifts, promotinge him and
his fellows into high offices techynge all kings to be the nources of the
Gospel / and as the holy ghost teaches them by saint Paul to give unto 1.
Tim. 5
the trwe prechers double honor / that is to say their dew reverence and a
living competent. This fact of the king confoated miche the church of the
Jews al be it they were in captivity / to see their Prophets and good men so
reverently and lyberally entreated of the king. It was also a way conueniente
for the word of God to be received of the Babylonites.

The king Nebucadne ^^^ / made a The. 3. chapter.

This chap. contains the contencion of the true and false religion at this
image / which perchance the king made / thereby to honor and give thankis to
God for the reuelacion of his dream. As yet do we worship God and saints by /
and at images. First of all / ye se an example of the king setting up a false

but also in his posterite / in the most terrible wise to have grenously
punisshed this sin* Daniel and the story / which is the light of times / be
plain witnesses.

And then the Chaldeis accused the Text.
Jews before the king / saying: Oh king eternally moughtye live. There be here
certain Jews which wilnot obey your commandment / nor worship your Gods nor
yet your golden image. etc.

Here is declared the envy of ydolaters against the trwe worshippers of God /
and accusers of good menshal be destroyed.

Then was Nebucadnezar angry / Text.
and in a furye commanded Sedrach / Mesach / Abednego to be brought before him

This is the descripcion of a wyked and iniust / and it contains the example
of a tyrant / not only defending the ungodly worship, papistry, and false
religion with sword and fire / but also with a blasphemouse mouth preferring
and extollynge his own power above Goddis. Thus do all tyraunts defend
ungodly worshippings and false religion against the doctrine of the law and
Gospel as witnesses the. 2. Psalm. It is trwly a damnable sin / to defend
ydolatry and supersticion / and sinful ceremonies, rites, tradicions etc. with
torments / and to say as here says the king / what God can deliver you out
of my handis? unto this perteyneth the example of Sennacherib unto whom also
blasphemynge / God said / I shall put a ring through thy nose. Gods will is
douteles by this example to fear tyraunts from blasphemies and unjust
judgment. What king therefore so ever will not sin as did Nebucadnezar / nor
perisshe with Sennacherib / let him not be minded / nor speak / nor do against
God nor his word / but believe his word and pray the lordis prayer and
govern as David techeth him Psalm. 101. and live aftir ye Psalm. 33. Aft^r the
king had so proudly asked them What god might deliver them from his hand?

The king (...) Sedrach / Mesach / and Abednego / adorare / that is to fast
down before the image and so to give it our Bisshops reverent behavior. And
they answered. Deu^ habemus que^ colimus. We have God whom we worship / which
answer / plainly expresses / that same adoracion to be siche an vtwarde
reverent behavior / which was plain ydolatrye / so that adorare imagi^^^ / is
contrary to colere deum. That is / to fall down before any image is contrary
and against Gods worship. Or else they might have answerde the king with
Winchesters worship / saying: We are content to knele down to it with a
certain reverent behavior / so that we give it not any inward godly worship.
But adorare imaginem auream / and colere deum / could not agree in Daniels
bokis and in his felows faith with our bisshops certain reverent behavior to
images. When these pharisaicall fox fewterers command the therefore to worship
images / or to crepe to cross, As did Nebucadnezar bid them faldowne to the
image / then with Daniel and his fellows tell thou them to their faces / that
thou have god whom thou worshipest / before whom thou knel est and not before
any image. There be many wordis indifferent to diverse Three h^ nors / a divine

and contrary significacio^s / as ar adoro / colo / seruio / to bowedowne
worship, to serve and to knele / which when the word following is added / as
to say adoro deum vel imaginem vel hominem / it is sone seen what worship is
meant / for the scriptures put never any siche words alone / but express what
thing is worshipped or honored. In the former chap. it is written. That the
king * down before Daniel and honored him with a civil honor. And we are
commanded so to honor our parents princes ministers of the word etc. But no
where commands God / but utterly forbyddeth it, to fall down before or to
honor images: wherefore it is plain ydolatry to faldowne or to knele before
them / and it cannot be excused colored nor moc* out with any popissh gloss of
a certain reverent behavior before images. For images be called in scripture /

Daniel. 9. and Christ himself confirmyng it addyth, Whosoever reads the place
let him understand it. Wherefore when an ydole or image or false Gods / follow
any of these words Adoro / colo / seruio and siche like / then beware of that
act / fall not down with no reverent behavior nor worship thou them. But say
with Daniel and his fellows / yea Matt. 5.
and as Christ said to the devil. To thy Lord God shall thou do reverent
behauior / and him only shall thou serve or worship / let these defenders of
ydolatry show us one place in all scripture / which either commands or
permits any ydoll honor or image service / which they call a doracion or
reverent behavior to any image. If they cannot / then let ve say to themas
Christ said to satan Avoid ye devil is and learn to worship your Lord God
and him only to serve.

When our idolaters will compel men therefore to fall down before their
images, let them constantly resist their damnable doctrine and be sewer god
both to may and will deliver them above all manis expectacion more largely
than we ca^ ask of him or think / as Paul says. And if our father prayed to
in the name of Jesus give us not at that time our peticion: Let us be certain
and assewered that for his glory and owr salvation he has given us himself to
be owrs for ever. The of fice of faith therefore is / in the cross / not only
to say. Thy will be done / but also with Paul to say / whether we live or dye
we be the lordis / again take ensample at David saying. If the lord will bring
me home again / well / so be it. If not / his will be fulfilled.

old false faith* sou* in with his mothers mylk / yea they kept daniel from him
so far and had brought the king nyghe home again unto his idolatry that they
caused him to erect this golden image as ye here see / supposing thereby to
have destroyed Daniel with his fellows as many as would not worship images. He
is not therefore a godly em^ and prince which diligently enquireth and sercheth
the truth and when it is fownde and known he neglects it and forgeteth god
/ and commands his own image to be worshipped / that is / at the persuasions
and flaterye, entysments and pestilent counsels of the enimyes to godis word
sets up their articles / rites / ceremonies and false religion / preferrynge
them above gods word / kyllyng the transgressors of his own false religion
and fauourynge the brekers of gods laws. Let all kings beware / how aftir they
have once tasted of gods truth / they admit siche popish flatterers into
their court and counsel.

But why was not Daniel here accused and cast into the oven? verily the king
had before so worshipped and ex tolled him into so high dignite / geuynge him
the name of his own God / that if he should now have casten him away he might
have had been noted of inconstancye / yea and this later act should have been
seen to have been contrary and prejudicial to his own former fact. And so
the king thought it to be against his honor so to deal with daniel and
therefore there was no mention made of him here.

Now therefore was the king yet mercifully called again with a another miracle at
the which not himself only but all his nobles / officers / and counselors
were present. Nethelesse yet for his pride / and securite in riches and welthe
/ he was not fully converted and trwly repentant until h^ had the^ other
vision folowinge in the next chapter and was grievously punished as ye shall there
see it / aftir the which punishment / he coming ayene to his right mind and
restored to his kingdomme / sent out this godly decree or proclamacion /
wherein ye see the dowble office of an unfeignedly converted king / of which
the first is to fere and serve god according to his word and commandments and
not aftir other menis enstruccio^s blown into his ears by flaterers.

so believes the most part of his subiectis. Hither to ye king deceived by his
wyked flaterers pro ceded in wykednes unto his own damp nacio^ and in to ye
destruction of his realm / now by repentance and thankis giving he is turned
into the path of salvation of him self and of all the gentyls following his
steapes. Before / he did setup the image to get himself a name and glory, with
the blasphemye of the name of god / For to worship god and to faldown before an
image with any reverent behauiowr ar so contrary that no man may do them both
and be saved. The king therefore confesses his sin before all his hole realm
the more clearly and effectuously / in that his commandment was spread so far
/ and yet dureth unto the worlds end. It is a token of trwe repentance when
so noble and mighty a prince is not asshamed openly Christ is with us in ye

the wysemen / the soth sayers of chaldey / astronimers etce. unto Balthazar is

him I told my dream saying. Balthazar chief master of the wise men and
astronimers all / in whom I know to be the spirit of the most holy god and
that there is no secret mysterye hid from the / tell me my drame and what it
signifies. For this was my dream in my bed. I did see a tree upon the
middis of the earth which was fayer and high The tree was great and strong /
so high that it reched unto ye heaven * and might be seen to the farthest parris

of the heuens / eating the moist grass with the brute beasts / and let the
humane or manis reason be taken from him / and brute beastis senses be given

dect^ed by the sentence of these spedy watchers in the counsel of these holy
messagers from heaven / that al men lyuinge should know / that ye most highest
must so rule and reign in the kingdom and empire of any mortal men / that to

Nebucadnezar did see / and thou Belthasar tell me what it means / for all my

Danielis doctrine had confounded the wysedom of all the kings spiritualtye /
and therefore they enuyed daniel and all the i^wes so gretely / and kept the
king thus long from this so godly an open confession and general pistle sent
forth declaringe his faith and repentance. This pistle shows how secure
prowed and negligent he was in his prosperity / Into which securite
negligence, and pride it is to be thought that his enchaunters sothe sayers and
spiri tual wysemen had casten him for fear he should have left his old false
religion. Now therefore the merciful god at last / which has kings hertis in
his hand Prou. 2^.
had cast him into a another fereful dream where upon he was thus moved to
spredeforth the glory of god and his own penitent conversion. First the king
confesses his faith / then he shows the miracles of the. 3. former chapters
/ affirming no god able to do these miracles but only ye god of daniel / and
at last he concludes the kingdom of christ (as it is in the. 2. ca.) to abide
for ever / god to be the changer of kingdoms and constitutor of kings. And here
note diligently / Securite to be the securite is ye companion of welthines.
companion of welthines / which securite casts down the king hedlong into
ye forgeting of god / so that he was become negligent and proud and in
conclusion like a brute beast. As says the Psalm. Man Psalm. 48.
when he was in honor he understood it not / wherefore he degenereth into
beastly nes. In this state (ah less for pite) lie many noble men of which
securite says david / when I was in prosperity / then I thought never to have
fallen. But ye serch^r* (...) of sich ungodly securite and welthy men / ye

not how gre uouse a fall and heavy a chance stood at my door / and how nighe
was the axe ye tree / and how frail and brytle is securite and welthenes to

ye meaning of his dream. But he sinned gretely in that he first in the
beginning askid not counsel at the servant of god but at the manciples of the
devil / Clear is the testimony of david / sayng / oh lord I call thy
testimonies into my counsel. wherefore when ye wise of ye world could not
interpret these dreams / and daniel could do it / it is signified not only
the same to be true (lord bring thou to us help / for vain is the help of
men) but also god alwais before ye reueling of his word to confound the
wysemen of the world / Wherefore ye king calling daniel to interpret his

office and of his coninge and lerning that thus the doctrine of ye ^^^the^
might be asshamed and the word of god florisshe in his kingdom. ^^ miche said
of ye narracion of his dream and of the vocacion of daniel to expownd / Now
let us hear daniel declaring his dream and calling the king to repentance.

Then Daniel called Belthasar being Text.
amassed spoke not almost of an howr^: he was so astonned that the king began
to awake him out of his trowblous cogitacions and heuye mind saying:
Belthasar / let not my dream nor the interpretacion thereof in any wise trouble
or hurt the. Unto whom Belthasar answer: ^ saying: Ah my lord and king.
This dream come upon thine enemies and the interpretacion thereof upon thine
adversaries. The tree seen of the so great so high* etc. it is even thou
thyself (ah king) so great and mighty* that thy high majesty attayneth to
the heuens and thine imperye unto the farthest costs of the earth. And as
towching him / oh king / (whom thou did see a watcher / an holy one flying
down from heaven crying / kut down the tree and destroy it / permitting the
stok with the rotes to stand still in the grownde / the same in cheynes to go
graze upon the field and to lie under ye dew and rain from a boue / co^man
ding him to eat with the beast is till his. 7. times be past) this is (oh king /
the interpretacion and sentence of the most highest decreed against ye (my
lord and king) Men shall cast ye forth to dwell with the best is of the field
/ suffering the to eat and feed with their oxen and thou shall lie wett under the
sky till thy seven times be past / that thou shuldst know the most high god
to be king and ruler over all the realms of mortal men and to give them to
whom he wills. But what signifies the stok with his rotes to remain in the
ground? verily that thy kingdom* shall stand to thyself to enjoy it so long
as thou shall aknowl e the god of heaven to be lord and king over it. Wherefore
(oh my king) let my counsel please the / allow it / redeem thy sins with
ryghtwysenes and thine iniquities with just doing to the poor afflicted / so
that thy felicite may be prolonged.

Daniel was of a more fervent and faithfuller spirit towerde his king / then
be now a days these flaterers so nyghe the^ in favor feding their affectis.
For he so loved him / that he would tell him ye trwth were it never so odiouse,
bitter* and displeasaunt* unto him. But in that he stayed so long ere he spoke
/ he declares his prudence / both because he would not seem rasshe and also
lest he should apere to rejoice of the king is misfortune. For albeit he was now
with his countrymen in captivity / yet would he be faithful to the king and
honor him justly / yea although he knew how tender and delicate be princes
^ares corrupt with the gloriouse glaueringe of flaterers / and therefore the
sooner exasperated with sharp and heuey tidings.

The astonned slaknes of daniel caused the king to be the gredier of the
truth / which also seeing the prophet to be so trou bled in himself / and as
one not gladly willing to test him of siche heuines / was the more desyerouse
to hear it and to have his counsel. For the king perceived some weighty
thing to be signified against himself. For where the divine iugeme^ts so fear
an innocent prophet / miche more should they be terrible to a wyked king. But
yet the goodness and i^ntelnes of ^ king apereth again / in that he animateth
the prophet exhortinge him to tell it whatsoever the dream be / pardoninge
him whatsoever he shall say: But daniel elegantly and wisely first mitigateth
ye matter / praying that these mischances signified / might fall upon the kings
enemies. By which wordis / he nether speaks against gods will / nor yet
dissembleth / but shewth himself to be heuye for the kings misfortune /
declaring himself to be the kings friend / or else he should have wysshed evil
to himself. As though he should have spoken plainly / for that I hold my peace
so long / think not that I dowte of your dream / but because I perceive it to
be a fearful vision / I pray god that it fall not upon you.

Daniel in telling the dream / digesteth it goodly into three parts / first
declaring the felicite and prosperity of the king. Secondarily his
punisshment. Thirdly his repentance. First he tells him that the tree so
great and high with all her beuty / birdis / beasts and fruits etc. signifies
the king Nebucadnezar: for that god had subdewed to him all other realms /
whereof before / he was called the golden head, and that not only for his ample
power / but also for his high arrogancye and pride attributing to himself in
his securite the glory of god / whose imperye is over heaven and ye universal
earth. He also magnified himself the more for his often victories. For he was
the Monarch of the world. And his name was fered over all. The The bra^ ches.

lyinge under the tree / be signified the subjects and commons living quietly
under his laws / defended by the kings power / and as it were under his
wings. And as this goodly mighty tree fed Learn ye kings.
and defended all these creatures / so ought the godly kings as I say says /
to be the nources and feders of their subjects / seeing them virtuously brought
up in gods laws / defending the innocent pore afflicted with iniuryes / and
punisshinge the malefactors. For it is their office / not The office of kings
only to defend the publyk peace but also punisshe ye malefactors and
preserve and promote the godly learned and to take charge like a father and

and tradicions of men. Hitherto pertayne all the places concerning Magistrates,
which kings and prin ces ought to know / for the good workis of kings and
princes are to do their office expressed in the scripture. Also the common people
and subjects signified by the lively fowls and beasts fed out of ye tree /
their office and dewty is to give thankis to god for the fruits and shadewe of
their tree / and serve and obey their prince praying incessantly for him. And
albeit the golden head and this fayer tree signi fyed the babyloni monarchy
and king / yet pertains this doctrine unto every em* (...) and prince yet
living which doing his office / is the very golden gift and most flourisshing
fruitful tree of god.

Secondarily where he sees the spedy watcher and holy angel so haastely
descending etc. He monissheth the king warning him of the judgment of god and
of his own humiliacion and deiection. For the voice of the holy watcher was ye
sentence and decree of the most high god against the king / which uses his
angels thus to serve kings and all good men / which are said to come down
that they should know manifestly whether there were so great arrogancye,
securite and ingratitude in the king or no / as in Angels come down. Cap. 11.

say / cast down the king from his dignite and honor / and let him be

The sermon of daniel is the some of ye Jesus is ye mouth of God.
hole divine scripture / Jesus to witness even the mouth of god, commandinge to

daniels brother what cou^ sell ought to be given to kings.
in christ / saing. The word of god is my counselor. As daniel has taught us
so it behooves us to teache other / as says Paul / diuyde trwely and imparte
the word of god to other / wherefore when daniel wysshed that his counsel might
please ye king he would teache the king no another way to eskape the wrath of
god to come, then by repentance according to the law and so to believe all his
symes to be forgeuen him / for / and through only the faith and confi^^^^^ of
the mercy of god / promised in christ.

Hereof may the godly sprited be led into the knowledge of the other iugements
of god. For god now punissheth to amend us / wc shall at last / if we amend
not / plage us to punisshe us. Now he sees Luke. 13.
the fig tee planted in the vine yard / and he coming to seek thereof fruit /
and none fynding / bids ye vine keeper / kut it down / saing wherefore
occupies it the grownde unto whom he answerthe. Sir let it yet this year
grow until I have dug it about and dunged the rote / And if it bring
forth fruit it shall stand / orelis let it be kut down. The unthrifty sone
takes his fathers substance and spends it vicioe^sly / and at last was
compelled to come to the hoggis troffe for hunger / but aftirwarde he repented
him remembering his fathers benignite / and so he retourning home is received
with great joy. Let us confer these and like parables with this storye /
And we shall learn our first parent (...) created of god to have been in so
high a dignite that he might have been compared with the angels / reching to
heaven, for that he was so excellently (...) with glory and innocencye / being
sewer / immortal / and lord of the creatures of the earth / of the sea and air
/ made unto the image of god. But yet did this unhappy felicite make him
forgete god his maker / and as an unprofitable tree to be kut out of paradise.
But yet abode the stok in the rotes / and in criste was his dignite conserved
yea and increased to / in that he repented. And even thus have we ourselfs lost
our kingdom / loking for greuouser punishment / unless we obey this most
holsom counsel of daniel / which counsel also all the scripture gives us /
and christ exhorts us ernestly thereunto. Only the devil reclameth and
shuts up the bowels of mercy / our myndis he puffs up / and entyseth
unto vnrightwysnes to make us his perpetual captives. The hebrwe text has
redeem thy sins with righteousness. Of the which the defenders of their merits
and adversaries to faith justifying / can take no hold as they seem to
themself. For the very rightwisnes or form of rightwyse making before god is
only of faith whereby our sins be sorgeuen / of ye which faith true almose,
and workis of mercy proceed as does the light from the son and Two
ryghtwysnesses / one of faith only before god / and another of ye law before
men.
heat out of the fire. Sins be redeemed before god in the rightwysenes of
faith. And they be redeemed before men in the rightwysenes of the law / of good
workis / of mercy / as ye se here the almose to the pore to follow at the
redeming and remission of sins before god in the rightwysenes of faith. So
that the kings just dealing, his mercy, compassion of the pore, were the
testimonies of his repentance and iustificacion by faith. This counsel of
daniel contains the hole law and gospel. First to know our sins by ye
law / then The order of iustificacio^
to repent / and by faith to be absolved / of which all / as out of the tree
there proceed ye fruits of repentance and faith that is the workis of love and
mercy to the pore afflicted. This counsel of daniel given to the king
declares / God straightly to require of the kings and princes not only the
obedience of his ten commandments but also princely justice that is the
diligent cure and charge of his church / which was then (as it is now)
cruelly entreated in captivity of menis tradicions / by the church understand
his subjects to whom the king (...) a public peace and fredome quietly to
hear tryst the word of god preched. And what Daniel taught his king / the
same ought all prechers to teache their kings. For danielis doctrine pertains
to all em^ kings and preachers unto the worldis end / and especially unto
this last time of the last Monarchye wherein the same face of ye church apereth
/ which then was seen.

Nethelesse yet came all these things over the king Nebucadnezar. For aftir.
Text.
12. months / the king walkinge in his princely palace of Babylon said thus
/ Is not this great and mighty Babylon which I myself have builded by my nowne
mighty power into the glory of my maiestey a worthy bewtye for a kings house
and familye? Whiles the king was thus speking / there fyldowne a voice from
heaven saying: Unto the (oh king Nebucadnezar) it is answerde and decrede /
that thy kingdom shall be taken from the thou shall be casten out fro menis
company / and with wild beastis shall thou live / eatinge grass like an ox
till thy seven times be passed over / to then tent thou shuldst know the most
high God to govern and rule the kingdom of mortal men / to change and to
give them to whom he wills. And even in the same hour was this thing so
fulfilled in Nebucadnezar / that fro men was he casten forth to eat grass
like an ox / to lie forth wette under the sky until his hears were grown
like ye feathers of egels and his nails like the claws of birds

These words speaks the king of himself as it were spoken in the person
of another man. All these things came to him / because he corrected and fered
by dreams and monisshed by Daniel / yet would he not repent and amend his
life. Nether did it repent god of his sentence. But he took him in the middis
of his ungodliness when he thought himself most sewer and welthy blowinge forth
his own gloriouse pride / his triumphs and magnificence not rendering the
glory unto god / and therefore by this voice from heaven was he thus condemned
and punisshed. God had tarried long enough for his repentance but because he
was every day worse and worse he printed into him the depelyer his punishment
/ rebukinge him the more sharply. But here let us note the condition and state
of an impenite^t king for all his godly teachings prechings to him
exhortacio^s monicio^s and godly bokis delivered him by his prophets and
learned men. He walked up and down / which is a token of an idle and private
person / he beheld his gloriouse cosily buyldings / with sich wordi^ as
declared wherein stood his transitory felicite and vain affectis. Here thou
seist a king over so many nations provinces and tongues ydely walking, praising
himself / as though in all his so wide a realm there had been no seriouse
thing for him to do. How many poor afflicted persecuted good men were there
oppressed? was daniel and his fellows, the people of god, there preching unto
him in captivity / all (think ye) well entreated? Wanted the king at that
time no good counsel nor lerning? where stood the pore men with there causes
to be heard? Whatsoever honest paste times (as they call them) be imagined for
kyngis to recreate their spirits, pressed with study and labors for the
preseruacion of their realms defense of their pore, and punisshing of
malefactors; yet in their pass times / let them beware lest justice / equite
and judgment be neglected / as they were in this kyngis idle deambulacion. For
by siche idle securite kyngis have fallen with Nebucadnezar into arrogance
pride and at last into blasphemies / and so cast out of god from their realms.
And especially siche noble men as have been endewed with great giftis and
prosperouse successes. For when they worship their giftis / their powrs,
strength, triumphs, victories / their riches etc. as their strange gods / then
begin they to despise the very god. Whose comminacions once neglected, they
will themselves to Sennac. Timoth Athene.
be worshipped for goddis. Example of Sennacherib thinking himself stronger
then God. Timothe of Athenes bosted himself openly in his oracion saying:
This victory have I done and not fortune. Great Pompeius said he would with
Pompeius the great
one spurn of his foot, fill all Italy. And thus by siche securite fill
Nebucadnezar into pride and sinned against the first table, trusting to miche
to his own wysedom and strength / rightwyssnes, policye and power / of which
ydolatry he fill into the breaking of the second table / even into the
oppression and persecutinge of the church of God. Also / God not to may bear
nor suffere long these sewer and welthey proud contempners of his word /
namely the rulers of his people / not only Sewer and proud kings god hates.
by all the comminacions of god / but also by the example of all kings and
princes destroyed for their securite and pride we may well confirm it. How
miserably was Sennacherib destroyed? (...) Timothe / aftir that proud saying
/ nothing prospered. And how wretchedly Pompeius that vpspurner of the earth
perisshed / Lucanus describes it. And how heuey was the image of this king /
Daniel here paynteth him / tellinge him not only to lose his kingdom / but
also his mind and glory which was miche beter. Further more that this example
of the wrath of god not being able to bere^ sewer and prwde kings be not
written for ploughe men and carters / but for em^ and kings to learn them most
of all to fere god when they most flourissh / have yet moo examples. If god in
david crystes father, might not bear the transgression of his. 10. precepts /
but for Vrios sake only, casten him out of his kingdom undoubted and certain is
it / none of the kings of the earth to siande long unpunished in their
securite and pride. Wherefore let all good princes learn this lesson long to
rule well / even not to worship themselves and their acts but to worship god
as he techeth them / nether their own belys and lusts to nourishe and feed /
but to nourish the church of christ. What princes should do
For albeit the kyngdoms be the houses and kouers of the church / yet for the
true churches sakis do the kings and their kyngdoms prospere and flourisshe /
as witnesses the scripture. Wherefore let all em^ro / kings, and princes,
sewer and proud, write in the middis of their hertis this saying of Daniel.
Thy kingdom shall be taken from the / to teache the to know the most high god
to rule and govern mortal menis kingdoms / and to give them to whom he
lysteth. For what else does daniel here teach but all siche weal sewer
emprowrs kings and princes to be plaged like Nebucadnezar if they repent not,
and cease their persecucion of christ and of his church this day captiued
under their ungodly articles / actis / institucions and tradicions, contempning
gods ministers calling them to a beter mind / as did here the king despise
daniel admonishing him / and therefore was he deprived of his kingdom wit and
mind to.

But aftir this / I Nebucadnezar Text.
lyfted up mine eyes into heaven and came again to my mind. And I blessed the
most high god / the everlasting syuinge god I praised / and magnifyed / whose
regal power is perpetual and his kingdom dureth for ever and ever. For all
the inhabitants of the earth are naught and nothing esteemed in comparison to
him / which at his pleasure does what he lysteth ^^ well with the company of
heaven as with the dwellers upon earth. Nether may there any man let or hold
bak his hand / or say to him / what doist thou? or wherefore have thou done
thus? In this same time my mind came again to me / I received again my glory /
the magnificence of my kingdom / my imperial majesty / my shappe and form
were restored to me / My counselors and my nobles sought me out / and I was
forestored into my kingdom that my majesty was more ample then before. Now
therefore I Nebucadnezar praise / extost / magnifye the king of heaven / all
whose workis be true and his ways right and just. It is he that may cast
down full low the proud.

This deieccion and humisiacion might not the king know being in his (...)
securite and arrogant pride. For then he blasphemed / he compessed men to
idolatrye / and was an heuey burden to all his realm. But now he tamed and
plaged of god / begins to repent and is now restored to his mind / now
thus afflicted he knows god and himself / he murmureth not against god for
thus punishinge him / but he breketh forth into his praise confessing his just
dealinge with him for his offenses / thus to be punished worthily / which he
could not have done except god by his graciouse goodness had thus lyfted him up
and given him understanding. Here therefore have ye an example of a penitent
king / which delivered from his miserye gives god thankis / according to gods
promise, saying. Call upon me / and I shall deliver the / and then shall thou
glorifye me. First here is described the affect of a penitent heart in his
tribulacion and arysinge therout / confessinge The confession of a penitent.
god to be just in his threatis of the law / and to be merciful according to
his promises of the gospel. Thus did king david repent and make his
confession in the. 51. Psalm. And daniel likewise cap. 9. powereth forth his
heart before god / teachinge us likewise to repent and to be converted to God.
Secondarily he expresses the fruit of ye kings repentance / that is to wete /
God to give miche more ample giftis to the repenta^t then he took from them /
as ye see him to have done to Job in his last ca. And daniel / for his miseries
/ oh how great rewardis received he? Thirdly he expresses the form of

in the hole psalter. For what else is the psalter book then the glass of the
most holy trinite The psalm ter is ye book of yt trinite.
into this end written for the church of the living god / to learn so to
repent and aftir our delyuerance to give thankis to god as here do the king.

Now since all things be written / as Paul says / for owr doctrine / let us
behold whether there be not yet daily daniels with their fellows sent unto
emprowrs and kyngdoms admonishinge them of like mutacions and soden fallis /
consyde^ how their wordis be regarded and their persons entreated. And whether
for their cruel persecucion they be not, or lykely to be shortly kut down
like this tree / cast out of their dicions empyres and realms, demented with

beastly lusts / having their consciences fetered with menis tradicions /
snarled with supersticiouse ceremonies and romish rytes / lying yet still
without the true church, naked* all virtue in storms and derkenes of errors
more palpable then in the seruitute of egypt / because they will not receive ye
fre gospel of the lybertye of the spirit to be regenerated by faith / and so
to do christ upon them, to be kouered with his rightwysenes 1. Cor. 1. Galat. 3.
holiness etc. For these dreams and visions be daily seen / and as the first
Monarchye was by daniel prophesied to be kut down / even so is this last
Monarchye of the Romans threatened likewise of the watching angel to be
shortly smyten down / and the everlasting kingdom of christ to be reveled unto
all flesh, newly risen from death unto everlasting life / in which he grant
us with his father and holy spirit to live for ever / so be it.

The argument of the. 5. chap.
This chapter declares the miserable fall of the last king of Babylon / and
heuey mutacion and end of his kingdom for his idolatry and so greuouse sins
committed against the first precept. Here is described a superfluouse fest
full of excess / even a very beastly banquet / where unto king Belsazar
bids his nobles / in which is manifestly showed into what an unhappy end
siche viciouse intemperate excess comethe. All kings and princes may learn
of this fall of so high a king to fear and to worship God as the. 2. psalm.
teaches them / lest of God the translator of kyngdoms, they be deprived their
realms with Belsazar.

THe king Belsasar made an exceeding Text.
feste biddinge thereto a thousand of his princes and nobles in whose presence
he drunk the wine / and at the workinge of ye wine he commanded the golden and
silver vessels to be brought forth / which his father Nebucadnezar had taken
away out of the temple of Jerusalem / that the king / his nobles / his wives
and concubines might drink out of them / which done / or in doing / they
praised and worshipped their own golden / syluery / coper / (...) / treen and
ston ney goddis.

Hitherto god has setforth his glory in the conversion of Nebucadnezar / now
he declares his gloriouse power in destroying and an end making of so mighty a
monarchye of the ungodly Babylonits / which destroyed / he with great glory
would send home again his people to build up again a temple more gloriouse
then before. In the former chap. ye see a king repenting himself and bringing
forth the trwe worship of god / whom god orned and endewed with giftis. Now ye
have a contrary example of a wyked king restorynge idolatrye / not repenting
/ whom God therefore casts down and gives his kingdom to ^other men.

Sardanapalus / Heliogabalus and this last king of Babylon / which in banketing
with his whores in a blasphemouse spite of the god of Israel / thus abused his
holy vessels, drinking dronken out of them with her lots, which because he
would not be monisshed with his grandfathers punishment nor take ensample at his
repentance* god took this heuey vengeance upon him and his realm. Nebucadnezar
was (...) down to be exalted / but Belsazar was dejected to be with all Babylon

repented and called for daniels doctrine and counsel and not have bannisshed
him and his fellows his court. In so present perelis to promise themselves
siche securite / to rejoice in bankettinge and festinge / to blaspheme god and
despise his trwe ministers and prechers and to neglect repentance / is the
most certain sign of an utter subversion of their kingdom and empire.

This story / first warns us of the horrible power of ye devil / which in
all ages abuses the most high emprowrs / kings and princes to confirm
idolatrye / and to in sondre the church of christ Wherefore very few princes in
the later days shall abolish the pope, retain and hold the true worship and
religion of god. Against yt which sclaunder and hurt it is necessary / godly
minds to be armed and defended. And here it behowueth godly men to know the
sins of emprowr and princes / which therefore do they corrupt and destroy
the true doctrine / because they would attemper and draw Gods worship and
religion unto their own profits and couetouse mynds / which verily is not else
then openly to illude and mock christ / of which blasphemose skorning of christ
/ thissame our age has to many examples.

Secondarily this storye exhorts princes unto godliness / and warns them of
the plages hanging now over all ungodly princes headis.

Thyrdly it testifyeth mutacio^s of kyngdoms and realms to be done of god now
shortly for the diverse and manyfolde crimes and enormities of the emprowrs
kings and princes. And here god punissheth idolatrye and blasphemy / as in
Manasse and in the kings of Israel. In dauide he punisshed aduoutry and his
counsel to murder Vrias. But it happens A lyek sentence. Prou. 29
often that the sins of the people be concurrant with their princes wykednes. As
in Osee the. 4. Siche princes and preistis / siche people. Nether is it to be
douted / but that these calamities / plages and punisshments of the world

their own popish articles of their false faith, above god, and punishing them
above the transgression of gods precepts. Wherefore the vessels of Gods heuey
wrath be now ^^ powering forth upon all regions / empyres and kyngdoms
worthily. For these errors in honoring and fering man mortact and his

manifest from heaven upon all ungodliness* vnrightwysenes etc. Hereof it Romans 1.

and now saying the possessours be rich lordely bisshops / abbots / priests

put themselves out of possession. But sin they not with Belsazar that
convert ye church goodis into profane uses? I answer: These vessels of ye

sinned in profaning them But the goods and jewels of our temples / abbeys and
bisshoprykis* are not consecrated to siche uses by gods word / but by their
own invented couetuose charmings / wherefore emprowrs / kings and princes may
take them away and putt them to beter uses / as to the maintenance of scoles /

/ the workman is worthey his wages. Bisshops and preistes that preche not

learned men at any time. For it is written / whosoever labor not / let him not eat.
Wherefore / as they be praised which / the idle belly burde^s removed, substitute
apt and learned laborers / even so sin they which translate the church
goodis into profane uses (which thing is now to common) suffering the pore
chirches, congregacions, and scoles to be cold and hongrye. For it is written /

all princes see diligently that lawful and apt ministers be honestly
entreated and nourished and that pore scolers of the church goodis be
sustained, to conserve the necessary studyes of the church. But it is a
dampnable deed to give so great wages to maintain the superfluouse excess
and viciouse living of idle bisshops / preistis and monkis / the true
flokfeders neglected / studyes and scoles not conserved. Nether have the
princes power to translate to themselves thecclesiasti^^ goodis / with the
defrauding of the pore chirches and scoles / but should asmiche as need is /
impart them to the poor congregacions scolers and techers / yea this should
they do / were ye goodis their own / miche less ought they to take away that
is given them / and well used / except they abuse it contrary to the geuers
will. And albeit ye geuers falsely enstructed, erred in their giftis: yet ought
the magistrates now beter taught* to take it away and reform the errors in
the giving thereof. Nether becomes it bisshops and preistis which should only
follow christ and his apostle^, to be lords over lands and possessions tangled
with civil and polityke seclare causes. Thus ye see in what cases the seculare
magistratis may translate the ecclesiasty* goodis unto themselves / provided
above all that the pore congregacio^s and common scoles and universities be
sustained and maintained with the same.

Fyftely in the changes of kyngdoms mat. 24.
god forgeteth not his church as christ comforts us / saying: When ye shall
hear rumors of bataill and war / be not you troubled thereat. For we must
wisely decerne the kyngdo^s of ye world from that eternal kingdom of god
which is crysts church. For albeit these batails and persecucions skater /
inquiet / and trouble ye chirches of goodmen in these heuey mutacions of
empyres and kyngdoms / yet have the godly ever this present consolacion, That
the church of christ is an everlasting kingdom / and may not by desperacion,
fall from out of crystis religion un to the ungodly / as they do now in Greece.
For the verite says: Father / whom thou have given me / noman shall take them
fro me / for they dwell in me and I in them inseperably. Also in the mutacion
of this kingdom of Babylon / god lyfteth up daniel giving him a greater favor
and autorite with the new king Cyrus then ever he had before / that even now
the haithen kyngis yet might be converted to the knowledge of god / for the
preseruacion of his church and that the publyk miracles might be known,
testifying this people of the jews to have the word of God and true religion.
Now have ye seen the abominable open crimes of Belsazar / as blasphemye /
idolatrye / reverent behavior to images / dro^kenes / glotoney / whordome /
ungodly securite / contempt of gods prophetis and prechers / despyght of his
people etc. to be the sins which God cannot long suffer unpunished, as
witnesses the kings miserable destruction and mutacion of his realm / and the
heuey co^minacio^s of his. y. precepts / and as I say prophecieth of Jerusalem
Babylons sister / saying: The day shall come wherein the lord God of powers
shall call syche sinners unto wayling / weping / tearinge of their hears / and
to gyr^^ themselves with sake: but what then shall they do? they shall rejoice
/ feste, banquet, and make merye, kill oxen and sheep / eat flesh, drink wine,
saying let us eat and drink / to morrow shall we dye / wherefore these so
greuouse sins of kings according to his co^minacions shall the heuey hand
of god viset as it folowethe.

And even in the same hour there Text.
apered ye fyngers of a manis hand wrytinge against the candell in the whight
parget of the wall of the kings palace / The kingis spiritualty is called to
court
the king himself beholding the fyngers so writing. Then was ye kings face
paal and his cogitacions so ferefully troubled him that the ioyntis of his
hippes and knees folldened down double under him. Then the king cried
commanding his spiritualtye / his wise men, enchaunters, desteny tellers / and
sothe sayers of Chaldey to be brought unto him, thus speking these words to
the wise men of Babylon. Who so ever shall read this writing / and tell me
what it means / he shallbe cled with purpure and shall have a cheine of gold
about his neck / and he shall be the third in my realm. Then came all the
kings learned wysemen which nether could read the wrytinge nor tell the
meaning thereof to the king. Wherefore king Belsazar was the more vehemently
troubled / in so miche that his chere was all changed and his princes and
nobles grievously astonned.

Even in the same hour wherein his ungodliness was ripe / and he blasphemed god
/ the lord would glorifye his own name in that all men should se the kingdom
of Babylon by the divine judgment to be subverted / and himself to be the
changer and translator of kyngedoms and times / even in the same hour wherein
the king thought himself most sewer and most beloved with his goddis for so
worshipping them being in the middis of welthy plesures / was this heuey
sentence written and given forth against him. Before the sentence pronounced and
ratifyed / there was time and place to repent him: but Mat. 25
now ye gatis shut up / in vain do ye folyshe virgins ask oil /
bringingforth their laumpes with knockinge. In vain wept Esau aftir Jacob had
prerept him his Genesis 27
blyssinge. Let us therefore seek the lord whylis there is time to find him:
Call Heb. 13.
on him whylis he is nyghe. Impenitent persons, nether find they nor seek
they. Now says god / send I no prophet to preche Isay. 55.
the repentance / but I write the thy judgment unable to be revoked which thou
may fear / but avoid it / thou may not Whosoever turns and thrusts away
my word and prechers, from him I will in his most need nether counforte nor
prophet send him. The king himself alone / and first ofall / did see this
hand writing / and not his gestis / as did Balams Number. 22
assese the angel which Balam saw not The hand came glyteryng forth against
the light and candlestyke. Rabby Saadias says that it was the hand of
Gabriel. Rabby Saadias.
But it was the hand of god / and man to be / even of christ: which is the
mighty angel of godis counsel and hand of the father. Then the king
changed his chere heuely. Sewhat an heuey soden change there is in the judgment
of god. Who was more puftvp with pride and more arrogant / sewer and sorowlesse
then was the king* but at this heuey unwont sight / how trembled he? For
nether in himself nor in his dronken lordis and wise spiritualtye found this
miserable king any help or conforte / and why? verily he had bannisshed the
court and neglected daniel ye minister of godis confortable word. But and if
he quaked and was so terribly afraid at this hand / with what an horrible
fear shall the hole glorified body of christ and his ferefull face smite ye
impenite^t ungodly / when he shall in his almighty majesty come down again to
judgment, pronouncinge with his mouth his grave sentence and judgment against
the wyked? The king (...) out strongly in this his fear / but not to god
almighty but to his images. He fled to his wysemen of the world / to his
divines and charmers as do they which have their spiritualtye / friars and
bisshops in siche estimacion for their popish lerning, worldly wysedom, and
preistly pollicye. But none of them might help nor counforte him or swage his
sorrow. He promises fayer / he threteneth bitterly / but all helps not /
^other men begane to look narowly upon the hand writing / supposing it to be
some fantasye and illusion / but yt iugeme^ts of god be unknown to the ungodly
/ only reuesed to ye children of god. His nobles were also troubled therewith.
For they which were parteners of the kyngis impiete / must nedis be partakers
of his punishment. So sone so / is the pleasure and joy of this world turned
into sorrow.

This pese contains the example of the king now despeyering in aduersite /
because his wise spiritualtye of the world could not turn the wrath of god
from him. Whereby we may confirm the co^minacio^s of god to be true. This
handwryting on this manner / I suppose / signified the prophecies of Isay /
Abacuk and Isay. 21. Abac. 3. Iere. 51. 2. Pet. 2.
Jeremy now to be fulfilled. Let all kings and people be afraid at Peter's
saying: Sodom and Gomor to be destroyed into ye ensample of like sinners.
Because that Belsazar is an example that mutacions of empyres and realms be
done of God for their a bominable sins / let them all kingdo^s for their
sins be changed.
as in a glass behold this example / lest suddenly for their idolatrye
blasphemouse persecucion of his ministers and word / they be destroyed as it
stands in the psalm. 33. Whylis the king was in his feastinge / the hand
of God writes his destruc^ion / let the^ learn therefore to estiew excess
dronkenes and blasphemies in banketinge and festing even the most certain
signs of ye mutacion of their realms. 1. these. 5. 1. Sa. 28 Isay. 8. and. 23.
Deu. 18.
Let siche sewer (...) rulers beware of a soden fall / for when they cry peace
and securite then is there present a soden destruction. The king thus troubled
asked counsel at his divines and charmers as did Saul at the dead / which is
against god saying: I shall destroy the wysedom of the prudent. And saying it
helped not / he was sore vexed / which signifies / not only the cogitacio^s
of the worldly wise to be vain / but also that before the reuelacion The
reuelacio^ of gods word co^ fou^deth the wise idolaters.
of gods word / god is ever wont to confound and shame menis doctrine and
tradicions contrary to his word / would god emprowr and kings would se
diligent ly to the godly instruccion of themselves and their people by faithful
fre prechers and good bokis. But because this cure of souls touch so few
rulers / and we will all with a little teachinge or non at all / be great
coninge crystianes / it is come to pass that emprours and kyngis maiestes
cannot defend themselves / the counsels of their wise be made void / god ever
saying: Thy empire shall be taken from the / and be given to thy better. And
contrary wise / the godly in aduersite to be counforted / as this part folowng
declares it.

Then the queen hearing of this Text.
fear and trouble of the king and his princes the queen was his gra^dame /
Nebuc. wife.
came into the banketinge house saying: king / long be thy life. Let not thy
thoughtis trouble the nether chang thou thy chere. For there is in thy realm a
man endewed with the spirit of the holy gods / in whom in thy fathers days
there was found the light of knowledge and siche understanding and wysedom as
have the goddis / him thy father Nebucadnezar made bishop of all the learned
divines of the wise men the spiritualty of the Chaldeis and prophets or
sothesayers / the king (I say) thy father did so: because Father is here his
grand father.
that in daniel / whom the king named Belsazar / there was found a
plentuouser and higher spirit / coning and understanding to expown^ dreams,
to declare secrets, and to solute hard questions. Now therefore let daniel be
called which shall interpret and declare this thing. And thus was daniel
brought to the king. Unto whom the king said: Art thou this daniel one of
the sons of the captivity of Judah / whom the king my father brought out of
Judah. I hear say thou have the spirit of the holy goddis / and not only to
be illumined and wise / but also to be in the an high amplier prudence then in
other men. There were now brought in before me / my spiritualtye / diuynes and
wise men to read this writing / and to show me the interpretacion thereof /
but they could not. But I hea re that thou can do it / wherefore if thou can
read and interpret me this scripture / thou shall be cled with purpure etc.

All this makes for the confusion of ye king and his wise men. For when they
all were thus troubled and amazed then come thereforth this old woman with
good counsel and counfort / if any had been left them. This queen was sober
and not in the fest emonge these dronherds with their herlottis / and therefore
she remembers and commends daniel with high praise unto her neuye the king
/ whom the more she commends / the more shame it was to the king all those.
3. years raignynge to not know / but neglect so wise and godly a counselor.
She called him not a captive / but spoke reverently of him with high
co^mendacions / but the gloriouse king spyghtfully asked him. Art not thou
that daniel one of the captives of the jews? This place co^teyneth two sermons
/ the one of the godly queen / and the the other of the ongodly king unto daniel
/ by whom daniel in the mutacion of the kingdom is promoued and the promise of
god is declared to be trwe / saying: I will be merciful into thousandis / The
old queen forgote not the trwe doctrine of daniel / as ye see by her wordis
commendinge him for his divine spirit / for his lerning, prudence, wysedom, and
of his bishoply dignite and ^ning to interpret dreams / mysteries / and to
solute hard questions. She monisheth yt king godly / under a color of
daniels praise to call him in and hear him / but he called him of ye same
intent as Herod called christ / as ye may see in his skornfull question asked
him. For as the calling of daniel now to late to the court made for the kyngis
confusion / so made it for daniel and the chirches health and counforte / which
under ungodly emprours and kings denyinge them socour and aid in their lands
/ may not there dwell and flourissh / wherefore the church so long wayleth
and suffers exylie until god correck the kings for her sake as david psa.

testifyeth. Blessed therefore be God our heavenly father which so tenderly
takes charge over the forsaken and banisshed ministers of christ our king / in
the kingdoms of this world / that in kyngis hawlis and courts there is ever
found an Aboi^s / which will defend Elias against the denylly she tongues /
and so in the mutacions of realms promote him / as was 1. of the kings. 18
Genesis 19.
here daniel exalted / but not yet so to escape with lot / the Sodomitis all
sonken. It is here to be noted / that the king iuged his sophos to have the
spirit of his holy godis as now do emperors and kings iug^e of their holy
ghostly fathers the friars and bisshops.

Then answered Daniel before the Text.
king / saying: Take thy rewardis to thy self / and thy gift is give them to
another. Nethelesse will I read the writing to ye king and the meaning
thereof shall I show the. Unto thy grandfather Nebucadnezar (oh king) the most
high god gave this kingdom / maiesiye / glory and magnifice^ce. And for this
his ample majesty given him all people / nations and tongues fered and dreaded
him / for that he slew whom he lysted / and reserved alive whom he will^d / he
exalted whom he wol de / and thrusted down whom he would. But when his heart
was thus puffed up with arrogancye and pride / he was deposed from his seat royal
/ and they took away his glory. And he was expelled fro men a beasily mind
given him / to wandre among wild asses and was fed with grass like an ox /
the dew fallinge from above standinge upon his body lyinge in the field
until he aknowleged the most high god to govern and translate the kyngdoms
of mortal men to whom he lysteth. And albeit thou Beltsazar being his neuy
haste known all this / yet have thou not humbly submitted thyself unto him but
exalted thyself against the lord of h^u^n commanding the vessels of his house
to be brought before the / that thyselfe / thy nobles / thy wives and whores
might drink wine out of them. Gods of silver / of gold / coper / (...) / tree
and of stonne which can nether see nor hear / nor feel / nor know any thing
/ thou have praised and loaued. But god which has thy breathe and life and all
thy ways in his hand thou have not worshipped / wherefore thissame hand is
sent the of him to write the this same scripture. And even this is the writing.
Mean Mean / Thekel / Vpharsin: as miche to say / as god has told up and
made an end of thy kingdom. Thekel is to say: Thou art wayed up in a bylance
/ and art found to light / or thou art bought and sold. Pheres / that is: Thy
kingdom is divided and translated to the Medis and Perses

Now is daniel called to be the foreshewer of the judgment of god / nether
salutinge the king / nor praising his giftis / in which thing he declares
the king to be casten away of god / and therefore vnworthey Eccl. 10.
reverence / he openly rebukes him for his greuouse sin, shewinge the
sentence of god to be given upon him and his kingdom. He nether flattereth him
nor thanketh him for his giftis / he sells not the grace of god for kyngis
giftis: but shows him plainly the causes why he should be slain and his
kingdom translated. First therefore daniel begins at the office of a true
precher not The office of a true precher.
sekinge his own / but gods glory and other menis profyt / even the health of
the congregation by confessing the trewthe. The a^dacite and bold speech of
daniel signifies the abieccion of the king and his realm. Then he lays
before Beltsazar the examples of his grandfather The examples of gods wrath are not to be neglected.
Nebucadnezar / whereat because this king his neuy amended not / but was worse /
he declares his sin to be the greuouser. For they sin most grievously of
all which amend not themselves at other men's punisshment / but neglect the
former written examples of gods wrath. As there was seuentymes double punishment
decreed upon the slayer of Cain / and seuentymes seven more pain for the
^layer of Lamech. And christ in Mat, How depely damneth he the ingrate cryties
that would not be monished by Sodom and Gomor? Mat. 10 and. 11.
wherefore if Beltsazar was slain because he would not be moved to repentance by
thexample of his grandfather / let us The use of ye examples of gods wrath.
now taught with other menis perells / amend our lives / lest for like sins
we suffer like pains. For verily / even this to be the use of all thexamples
of gods wrath / it is plain in Paul to the Corinthes. 1. Corin. 10. saying:
Our fathers were smyten down in the desert / because they should be unto us
figures and monicions that we fall not into like lusts. These things be
written for our warninge, over whom the end of ye world hangs. Wherefore
whosoever stands / beware he fall not. Daniel amplifyeth and aggrauateth the
greuousnes of the kings sin, by coupling strange and contrary gods with the
very true god / signifyinge the king not therefore only to be deprived his
life and realm / because he co^tempned the example of the wrath of God in the
fall of his grandfather / not moved thereat to repent / but also because he
passed far his grandfather insynne / in that he blasphemed the very God / in
worshipping and doing reverent behauours to his false gods and images and
profaning or abusing ye holy vessels. And thus does daniel tell the king / to
be destroyed and his kingdom to be translated for these two sins / one
because at the example For two sins / kingdo^s be translated.
of Nebucadnezar he would not be warned to repent himself / the ^ other sin is
the violatinge of the first and 2. commandments in committing idolatrye and
worshipinge or reuerencinge images which there is no sin more greuouse
deserving the present punishment powered forth of the wrath of God from heaven
both upon emprours / kings / princes and upon their empires and kyngdoms / as
ye here see it manifestlye.

The three wordis written of the hand The explicacio^ of the. 3. wordis.
of god / Mean Mean / Thekel / Vphar sin. Daniel expouneth thus. The first
word Mean signifies god to have nou^bred / told / or mesured / and appointed
the symites and time unto tyraunts, beyend the which they shall not pass / nor
before the which time prefined by gods infallible and immutable providence,
they shall not fall nor dye. Mean therefore signifies the time of the mutacion?
And the the other two word is signifye the manner of the mutacion / not only of
this kingdom / but of all the kingdom of the world at all times, so to come
to pass by Gods decreed will. Also the repeticion of this word Mean has a
great pythe / signifyinge the time and hour offiche decreed iugements of god
certainly and suddenly to come upon them. As said Moses to the Corites. And as
in this our time says Number. 16
Draconites / was that tyrant deprived his gouerna^ce at his ripe time / when
he said: that he had sever God in heaven to have been dead then his own wyked
fellow. Well therefore prays the Psalm agenst siche blasphemouse tyrants that
few and short might be their days / for they be very Iudases. Wherefore / as
this psalm. 108
word Mean warns tyrants of Gods heuey judgment hanging over their headis /
that they should repent and be monisshed according to the. 2. psalm. as was
Ezechias and so obtained. xv. years addid to his life / so it counforteth / the
oppressed of tyrants that we should suffer patiently and endure constantly for
that the Psalm. says. Shortly and suddenly shall the ungodly be destroyed and
perisshe. Psalm. 2.


The the other two wordis Thekel and Vpharsin tell us the plages and manner of
their coming. Thekel signifies Beltsazars kingdom to be now wayed / bought
and sold from him. The third word. Vpharsin signified his kingdom to be
divided from that nation unto ye kings of Mede and persie. For the first plage
of emperor / kings / princes and preistes is to lose their auctorite and name
as has the psalm. Contempt is powered forth upon psalm. 106
princes and rulers god making them to err in a wrong way / but the poor
afflicted he helps out of this trouble and fedeth his household as his own
sheep. Since empires and realms stand by gods power / it must nedis be God that
gives kings their auctorite as it is written. 1. reg. 10.
And part of the host went their ways with him / even they whose herts god
had towched. Also thexamples of all ages wytnes. The noble men to have been va
leant in auctorite / and not by manis power and wysedom to have enjoyed their
hertis desyers. Wherefore whenever any mutacion hangs over the princes and
rulers headis and their realms / then begins their auctorite and name to
dekaye and be minisshed. For do not the consent of all good men iugd now
otherwise of the pope his cardinals / bisshops / religiouse monkis and preistes
then they did of late? Be not menis minds turned from them? Is not their
proud falsely usurped auctorite worthily blotted out of good menis hertis? The
other and his last plage is the loss of his kingdom / for as did david
succcede Saul / so do here ye Medis and Pe^seis succeed yt Chaldeis and
Assyriens. And this was lo / the end of the first Monarchye and of so
gloriouse a golden head. Let all tyraunts now therefore cease / likewise to
trust to their own riches and power / let them repent themselves of their
persecucion of gods word and his ministers. And think that they may shortly
by some soden chance lose their kyngdoms and empires as did Beltsazar lose and
leave his most flourisshing empyrre of Babylon unto the Persyes which had as
yet in the begininge very little power. Also note this thing / That as David
pondred and wayed Saul / as ye see in the psalms / even so do the consent of
the christian congregacio^s in their 54. and siche like psalm is
prayers / way and pondre (as it were in the lances of gods word) the
wykednes of our present persewers at the comminacions of God sainge: I shall
viset their iniquite. Let emprour and princes therefore wisely and godly in all
fatherly love behave themselves against the christian chirches their subjects /
that they may be favored, and as in the. xx. psalm. prayed fore. For if their
auctorite and favor be lost in the christian chirches / and they be prayed fore
as the Jews in Babylon prayed for Babylon and their persewers in the. 137.
psalm. both the emprour / kings and their kyngdo^s are undone. The last word
Vpharsin signifies clearly ye kingdom to be dissipated and skatered and given
to the Persians / which albeit they were xenophon.
helpers to ye Medis (for xenophon plainly denies the person of Darii to be
present in ye besege thereof) yet by his host present with king Cyrus / they
obtained the cite. Wherefore / according to the prophecyes the kingdom of
Babylon was at last translated unto Cyrus that he should send home again the
Jews out of captivity to build up their temple / for the which to be done
daniel was promoued.

Then Beltsazar commanded that daniel shuldbe cled with purpure / and a Text.
golden chain hanged about his nek / and to be proclaimed the third lord or
ruler next him in the empire. the church wherefore it flourishes more in
captivity then at liberty.


This place has an example whereby we confirm / God in the mutacions of
kyngdo^s / therefore the more to honor his church then in peace / that they
might convert the victores and increase his church among them. For through the
honor obtained by Cyrus / daniel (as soon as Babylon was taken) begane to be
known what he was of Cyrus and Darius which aknowleged themselves to have had
wone the cite by gods favor. Wherefore let christian congregacions be confirmed
by this example / in perturbacions of realms / not to fall to the ungodly /
but rather to hear christ saying: When ye shall hear rumores of bataill / be
ye not Mat. 24
afraid nor troubled. To receive clothes gold and promocion of kings is not
sin / so long as they be taken to thentent as daniel received them. For to
the pure all Titu^. 1.
things be clean / and contrary / to the polluted and infidels all are unclean
/ but both the mind and conscience of these men are vnpure / as Beltsazar
honors not daniel as the prophet of God but as he would have done to any one
of his diuynes and spiritual enchaunters and sothsayers / nether repents he
himself / but would be seen to keep his promise to save his princely honor.
Whatsoever is not of faith / is sin. And therefore he falls Romans 14
as it follows. Text.


In the same night Beltsazar the king of the Chaldeis was slain.

This place as it were the conclusion of all describes the fall and death of
the king and mutacion of his kingdom / for his blasphemye and festinge in
securite and synfulnes. xenophon writes Babylon xenophon.
to be taken the same night where in the king in great securite and confidence
celebrated his fest unto his god Beel. For Beltsazar in his huntinge / of envy

fyngers only god to be the defender of empyres and realms / so that except he

golden head of the world suddenly for their idolatrye / contempt of the trwe
prechers and for the neglectinge of Gods word sent them / to be destroyed: but
let them worship and thank God only the father of Jesus christ our delyuerer

An example of daniels accusers torn of the lions, is here setforth to fraye
all flaterers about kings from evil counsel* geuinge and to deter them
from their false complaynts and maliciouse accusacions of the inoncent
ministers and prechers of goddis word. For in this chap* as it were in a
several little book concer ninge the false accusers of prophetis and true
prechers torn in pesis of ye lions / we see that evil counsel is the worst
of all to the counselors. But to teach the readers plainly and orderly that
they might the easlier hold this golden little book in memory / we will divide
it into. 7. places. The first is of ye office of victours or conquirors. The
second conteyneth a terrible example of the spiritualte and bisshops being in
court and of counsel steringe emperors / kings and princes by their evil
counsel unto persecucion mischeife and wykednes. The third has an example of
the constant confessor of gods word. The.iiii. has examples of the infirmite
and weakness of faith and of the persewers of the word.

The fyft has examples of the wrath and mercy of god. The.vi. has an
euangely proclamacion of king Darii.

The seventh has the example of a man glorified aftir his cross.

Darius Medus being. lvii. years Cap. vi.
old / took upon him the kingdom / whom it pleased to constitute. 120.
gouerners over ye hole empire. Over these men he ordined. 3. chief princes or
rulers (among whom one was daniel) unto the which. 3. high rulers / the other.
120. should give a rekeninge of their offices / that the king might be cased
of his so chargeable burdens. But daniel excelled all the princes and gouerners
/ for that he had so excellent plentuose a spirit / wherefore the king had
thought to have ordined him gouerner over his universal empire.

This Darius king of the Medis / xenophon Darus Cyaxares.
calls Darius Cyaxares ye son of Astiagis / whom Cyrus succeeded to reign
over the Medis Persis and Babylonits / and Cyrus was the first king of the
Persis / and reigned aftir Darius xxiii. years / with whom / Darius aftir they
had taken Babylon reigned not fully one year. So that king Cyrus in all Cyrus
reigned 24. years.
reigned. xxiiii. years. This king Darius / in that he constituteth so godly
gouerners in siche an order over his empire / he techeth all victores and
co^quirers their office aftir their victory to constitute the polycie and to
reform the church bringing althinges aftir so great confusion in the
mutacion / into a beter ordir. For although these two kings Darius being the
elder / and Cyrus the younger / both together had taken Babylon / and because
Cyrus gladly (as xenophon witnesses) gave the title of the empire to Dario:
therefore do daniel here declare ye empire to be ordered and reformed aftir this
manner of Dario. First he constituteth. A godly ordinance in kingdom.
120. gouerners to be set and divided into. iiii. or iii. parts of his
kingdom into which parties (as we divide ours into shiers) that empire was now
divided. These gouerners were as ye kings hands and eyes / as here aftir ye

which rulers thus says Peter: Beye subject to the gouerners sent of ye king.

peaceably and ordrely ministered / justice equite and judgment trewly executed
for that little time / that the church of God might be the easilier reformed.
For doutles / Darius enstructe and counseled of daniel, aknowleged this so
great a victory to be of god for his chirches sake the jews / and therefore
Cyrus gave god the thankis and received this counsel of daniel so to order the
empire, and at last to give the people of god, the jews / lyberty to return
and to buyld their temple in Jerusalem. Of this ensample let al christian kings
hauig siche victoryes seek out the counsels of the godly learned trwe prechers
of the word and aftir their doctrine and counsels order their common policyes
and chirches so that their constitucions and actis repugne not the gospel of
christ. But see / see how the shade we fo lowth the son, and envy felicite /
and how that lying false thief the devil by his enuiouse spyghtfull
spiritualtye lays a wait to destroy both the prophetis and good kings.

Wherefore these chief rulers and Text.
the gouerners studied to find some occasion to trappe Daniel in the kings
matters / but no crime nor sin could they find in him / he was so faithful
and just that no fawlt nor unright could they find in him. Then these men said
/ we shall never find any fawlt nor occasion against this Daniel / except we
invent somewhat against him in the religion and worship of his own god. And upon
this / these preistis and gouerners went together to the king saing* king
darius for ever might ye live. All the princes and lords spiritual and
temporal gouerners counselers nobles and officers over thy empire and
provinces have decreed to make a kings law or act to be proclaimed and
straightly to be observed. That whosoever shall ask any thing of any god or
man by. 30. days but only of the / which art the king / he shall be casten
into the lions den. Now therefore / oh king / confirm the decre and subscribe
it that it be not changed / according the ferme and perpetual law and custom
of the Medis and Persians that no man be so hardy to break it. Wherefore Darius
the king subscribed the commandment now written.

Mention before is made of the spiritualtye of the chaldeis being ever in so
high auctorite and in counsel with the kings of Babylon that in all high
hard and dowtful things they sought their counsel and coning at them which be
called in ye text / Magi / Sophi / diuini / inca^tator^s Magi.

their high lerning vayn lies and lying vanite / as ye have seen it before in
the in terpretacio^s of Nebucadnezars dreams and visions and now last of all
in the declaracion of the handewriting unto beltsazar. Wherefore the enuiouse
enchaunters and spyghtfull spiritualty never cea sed hunting for occasions to
destroy daniel. And now they seeing him in most high favor with these two
new kings lykely to cause them to reform their false religion and to bring in
the very trwe religion and worship of the very god / con ceyued this deuillishe
act and promoued it unto these bisshops the overseers and rulers of the
counsel causing the^ to bring it unto the king / and himself to confirm it

But wherefore did Darius subscribe so sone to this decree and deuillissh act?
verily his spiritualty had bewitched him thus to do. So it was that daniel was
in favor and herd of, both Cyrus and Da rius but especially of Cyrus to whom
he cleaned most for the prophecies that went upon him out of Isaye to be the
restorer Isay. 42 and. 45.
of his people. And Cyrus had daniel in high honor. Now was Cyrus but young
whose father was not king / and Darius was sage, old / borne his father being
a king. And as daniel exceded all the gouerners and bisshops in auctorite, so
began Cyrus to excel Darium in glory. Now did his flaterers by the counsel
of his sothe sayers and spiritualty persuade (...) unto Dario / that although
he was Cyrus his elder and a more aunciet king of the Medis, comen of a kings
stok and by whose power and might babylon was wone / yet (if he looked not well
about him) Cyrus would disapoint him of the title thereof and be called king of
babylon. This dissimilitude and unlike state or condition of men is a non the
cause of suspicions, hatereds, and discord / as xenophon writes Darium
Cyaxare^ to be offended with Cyrus his glory new beginning to increase / and
therefore with tears to have complained and reasoned the cause with Cyrus
affirming himself to be despised / not withstanding / he was well pacifyed by
the meruelouse diligence and faithfulness of cyrus giving gladly place and
preeminence / yea and the title to / of the empire Disparilite and felicite
brig forth envy and debate in every estate.
of babylon to Dario. And thus craftily brought (...) the spiritualtye of
babylon to pass / that Darius for fear of his auctorite, glory, and dignite
to be minished or taken from him / of him that nothing less thought (...) / so
suddenly and secretly with out the consent of either Cyrus or Daniel subscribed
this ungodly act. So sone ca^ these craftye courtly wittis and politic
popisshe prudent, find out subtyle deceits and frauds to put out the just and
Godly Cyrus of auctorite to let him of his prosperouse success and godly
intent in his realm / and must suffer this ungodly act to goforthe. Siche
ministers ever has the devil which can seek occasions craftily to auerte good
kings good myndis from the trwth when under an high pretense of office and
vertewe / awaite is laid to destroy them. As here whylis this old king Darius
thought to get himself honor above Cyrus he thus bewitched perceived not how
great sin he committed in suffering this his wyked act to be proclaimed and
subscribed, forbidding the inuocacion of god / and confirming himself to be
exalted above god. This example therefore monissheth emprours and kings to be
wise in observing siche deceytes and namely in their own laws artycles actis
and proclamacions to be publisshed / lest they usurp gods honor. For xenophon
writes Darium very heuely to have (...) taken the contempt of himself and
therefore to have (...) fallen away from Cyrus. Wherefore it was a very easy
thig for the devil by wyked flaterers and wykeder counselors so to inflame
Dariu^ ^o enacte siche a commandment against the first precept of god / nothing
to be asked of any god but of himself and al to obscure the glory of Cyrus and
to trappe daniel. For all this drifte of these spiritual enchaunters with
their captiued accomplices the counselors / was to cause daniel to be torn in
pecis of the lions. And as these subtle charmere with their crafty courtyers
did grievously sin for that / so deceitfully and subtyly they took an occasion
/ and with so glitering a pretense of their dewty and vertewe: laid this
fraudelent beyght for the king and religion / even so sinned the king in that
he suffered himself to be persuaded of these false hypocrites and flaterers / all
benefits to be asked of him self as of a god. For the simple old king saw it
not / that whyls he looked for honor above and against Cyrus / he prohibited the
inuocacion of gods name and casted down daniel into the perell of his life. But
what shall godly men do when that know themselves thus to be vexed and
persecuted with siche ungodly actis? verily they must then pray more mightily
then before as is folowthe.

But when daniel knew this commandment Text.

opened towerde Jerusalem / he deyly three times / upon his knees fill down

Now is there a greuouse bataill bent against daniel by these venomose vepers.

his kingdom / of their delyuerance and restoring to his trwe worship, and to
ask the same continually and constantly. Daniel would not dissemble with the
wyked act and commandment of Darius / but asked in time their delyuerance of
god for crystis sake promised. And albeit / thrice in the day as at morninge /
midday and eueninge to pray was commanded them / god to give us happy beginning

can nether begin nor continue or end any good thing / yet may it signifye

and daniel also at all times / holdinge God in their prayers with his own
bondis and promises / his people to be delivered out of the captivity of menis

christ / his passion now being at hand? For then / for the confession and

into ye paynfull pit of death / well therefore in the time of the cross does
Paul bid us pray in every place / and christ bids us asweis pray as daniel

his godly power and miracles showed for them / and in confession aknowleginge
himself and the people to be sinners and god to be true and faithful of his
promise in saving and delyueringe siche sinners that thus call upon him in
faith. Christ in his agonye* his disciples pray lest they should fall into
temptacion / and Paul bids us ever to give thankis to god through christ.
Wherefore daniel would not dissemble in c^ssing to pray for the time.

Now these men insidiously observing Text.
daniel / espied him praying and making supplicacion to his god Wherefore they
went unto the king reasoning with him upon his act and commandment sainge:
East thou not publisshed an act decreed in writing / that who ask any thing
of any god or man by. xxx. days / but only of the (oh king) he must be
casten down into the lions den? whom the king answered saying / yisse
tr^wly. And it must be holden fermely inviolable aftir the law perpetual of
the Medis and Perseis. Then they answerde* sayng before the king. This daniel
one of the This da niel / was spoken of spite and conte^pte
n^umbre of ye captiued Jews regards nothing at all thy commandments oh
king: nor yet thy proclamacion which thyself have publisshed in wrytinge. For
thryse every day he prayth / which thing the king hearing / was greatly heuey
for him. And thought plainly to have delivered daniel / and studied unto the
sone going down laboring hardely for his delyuerance. But these men so
insidiously cominge to the king told him. Thou must know it (oh king) that the
law of the Medis and Persies is / that no act / no commandment or law made
of the king may be changed. Then at the kings commandment Daniel was brought
forth / and they did cast him into the lions den. Then the king spekinge to
daniel said: Thy god whom thou have ever worshipped deliver the. And there was
brought a stonne and laid upon the mouth of the den which stonne the king
with his own seallor ring and with the signet of his nobles sealed / that
there should nothing else be done against daniel / or left his will should be
changed in daniel.

Here have we an example of a weak simple old king bewitched / deceived and
ouercomen of his gosily flaterers and of his own polityke counselors. Now ye
see the great diligence of these enuiouse hypocrites / ye see their deceites /
vnmerciles murder / and ingratitude. Daniel was now a right venerable sage
old father more then. lxxx. years old well deserving and pains taking to
profit every man / so that worthily he might have been called pater patrie /
the father of the hole land. But all his benefits / his vertewes / his
innocencye / nor his reverent sagenes might not move these maliciouse magos to
refrain them selves and to pity him. Only go they about to destroy the man
/ and all because he worshipped god only and no man nor creature. These be the
venemouse spyders which creping into every fayer flower of the garden gather
nothing else but present poison. Now behold their sleighthy poison. They come to
the king / not first of all accusinge daniel / for that they knew the king
loved him so intierly: but they first trapped the king in that they preassed
so sore upon him with his own laws and actis aftir the law of those nations
in nowyse to be broken or changed / the king once confirminge them. They
reasoned with him of the inviolable fastness of the act and decree / unto Of
laws and actis.
which / the king no siche thing suspecting as they went about / anon
granted. And verily to speak of laws and acts / there is nothing so necessary
to common wealis and kingdoms to be conserved as the holy obseruacion of good
laws. For they be compared to an hedge or pale which keep of evil beastis
from the good garde^s, which if they be broken down in any place / an ingresse
is open to all evil denouring beastis. Or if ye law be once or twyse dispensed
with / anon it ceasseth any more to be a law. Plato compares laws Plato.
to pillis medecyns or pocions / which if ye syke body teuomite / there is no
health to be looked fore. Wherefore in good* laws and actis there behowueth to be
a certain divine auctorite. Who would bear a^werde which nether to kutte nor to
smite is nothing apt? To conserve laws and to nourisshe justice, is ye sword
given from god above. And therefore be laws called holy / because it is not
lefull to break the^: but they be ferme and immoble. The laws are above the
kings / as Darius here confesses. It were the most indigne and detestable
thing that good laws should be subject and under evil men. For if the laws
be godly and good / he fights against God that breketh them. Of this thing is
the kings scepter a very apt sign and token / in that it is ferme and
inflexible. Which thing the jews well understood when they / to deryde
crystes kingdom / his auctorite and laws / Mat. 27.
gave him a reed in his hand wauered with the wind / signifyinge that
inconstant kings must make wavering and weak laws to day made / tomorow
marred. But these enuiouse enchaunters did wisely dispute with Darius of the
solidite and fastnes of his laws making the king inferior to his laws. But
fulwyked was their deceyte to thruste into his head so ungodly and so dampnable
an act for a good law / which the king should have rejected utterly. For by
that act both ye king was dampened and daniel his wysest counselor destroyed.
This their mischeuose fraud at last espied of the king / (but all to late) he
labored the hole day to save daniel / but all inuayne / for the rigor of his
law prevailed for that (as these subtyle serpents had perswadid it) it was not
lefull for the king to violate it. Oh how pertinate and styfe are the ungodly
lawers and act makers in their own wyked laws to be conserved? What excuse
shall ye bring / oh ye false lawers / and brekers of gods holy decrees co^man
ding you nether to put to nor to take away any thing from his word? Have ye
not Deuteronomy. 12. Mat. 15. Isay. 29.
red, alleged of Christ so solemply this grave sentence out of I say saying:
Inuayne do men worship me with menis tradicions and doctrynes?

And here is to be noted / that laws be made for diverse causes as some / that
by their obseruacion / god might be worsshiped. These laws of noma^ else then of
god himself may be made: Noman ought to chang them / as be these. Only god
must be worsshiped and loved above all / owr hertis must be kept clean from
hatered / avarice / adultery / from crueltye that it be a* worthy habitacle for
god. Which fulness of this law christ when he came accomplisshed it for us. For
with these laws / of faith and innocencye god will be worshipped: unto these
whosoever add or take from the^ Psalm. 18.
he is accursed. These laws make perfect the inward man* yet ar there other
laws made to govern the people and their howses which if they be not prejudice
to faith and Lyuil laws.
charity / alb eit men make them / yet must we keep them as gods laws for the
auctorite of the magistrates sake whom God has institued. But and if these
humane laws look to destroy the christian lybertye / to combreme^s consciences
and to oppress the glory of christ, God forbyde that either for flaterye or
fore fear we should iug^e or think them to be compared with gods laws or to
be suffered of any cristiane to stand. A law is not abrogated but stablesshed
/ if the intent and mind thereof be kept. What so ever is against the law of
god / it is no law nor justice / but tyranny and ungodliness. And if it be
made fiercely to rune upon menis sowlis / so is it the more pestilent then it
should hurt menis bodies or take away their goodis. Manis laws therefore ar
approved so long as they keep them with in their own bowndis / so that god be
not worshipped with them / but let them serve the peace and not obscure the
glory of god but plant honestye. But return we to the text. Then at the
kingis commandment etc. Great difference was there betwixt the sin of the
king and the crime of daniels accusers. For the king sinned of weakness and
simplicite, deceived of these maliciouse murderers / but his accusers accusing
of envy the servant of god sinned against the holy ghost. And therefore the king
a non was smyten with repentance and pite, bewayling the death of daniel /
seking ye best wais he could to save him / and when he could not / he gave
place to his wiked accusers / excusing and also condempning himself and Daniel
to He confessed daniel to serve god which was able to deliver him / nethelesse
yet he condemned him. But wherefore did the king thus t^mpt god to deliver him
/ seeing himself might have delivered him^ the king had great compassion on him
/ even miche like pilate, pronowncing criste an innocent and yet gave sentence
upon him to be crucified. But what an offense was given to the jews to see
daniel the just casten to the lions / whilis other wyked were herd and
praised: Only the king excused him / and yet himself destroid him / for he was
a fraid for lesing of his governance. And there was brought a sto^ ne and. c.
That the miracle might be the clearer / god provided / the mouth of the den
to be sealed with the kings signet and with the signet of his nobles that thus
conspired his death / that non should suspect Daniel to be delivered by any
manis help as to have casted in to the lyo^s any other meat. Thus was christis
sepulcre sealled and kept that the miracle of his resurreccion should the
euidentlier apere. The last sentence of the text is.

That there should nothing else be done against daniel / or thus / lest any thing
should come to daniel contrary to the kings will By which sentence it is meant /
that the king perceiving daniels enemies crueller then the lions / and so if
the lions should spare Daniel yet would he be sewer that his accusers should not
open the mouth of the den and destroy daniel by any other meanis. Dan.
therefore now dwells among lions but with faith in god is he defended / as
has the pistle to the Ca. 11.
hebreus. Faith stoppethe the lions mouths / and thus is he brought again to
that first dignite of Ada^ created unto the image of god to have dominion over
all beastis / for even the cruel lions testified daniels innocencye, which
the most wiked rulers were not ashamed to defame: now was his te^ptacio^ and
cross at the higheste and therefore in time does god help that we and al
faithful by his example should learn in our most perels to trust and believe in
god. Like ensamples of goodme^ preserved from beastis has Eusebius the. 9 book
of the Ecclesiasti storye.

Thus have ye an example / the chirch of god not to want persecucions / and
that the minds of Princes shall be craftily snarled and bewitched of their
deuillisshe counselors. This example therefore monissheth them to be wise in
observing siche deceit and namely in their laws actis proclamacions etc. to be
publisshed: lest they vsurp gods honor. Here is set forth Weak faithed.
an example of a weak faithed king betwixt whose sin and the sin of the
persewers of crystis ministres, we ought diligently to discern. He is weak
faithed which loves and enbraceth the trwe doctrine / would promoue it /
suffers himself to be enstructed and studieth to profit there in and
desyereth the techers to be preserved / and confesses the trwth in a manner /
albeit he dare not defend it openly and freely enoughe nor strongly /
nethelesse he nether denies it nor persecuteth it. Siche weak persons Paul
bids us To. 14.
receive iently / addig that god receives him and may confirm him. Siche weak
ons were the apostles at crystis death.

For verily cue^ thus does god govern his faithful that they should aknowlegde
their infirmities / out of which aftir great and many batails betwixt their
feeble flessh and the spirit they might come forth there ofwith victory. ^
herfore Isay says a smoking match god wilnot out quench Isay. 42 psa. 144.
and again. The lord lifts up all that fall / and puts his hand under them
that theibe not hurt. Even thus was darius weak. For he received the doctrine
he had mind to defend it / he confessed it / he would have promoued it with
his testimonye and confession / which all were tokens of a godly mind. Nether
douted he thereof / but of his own power to spread and to s^t it forth he
douted. For he was thus demented and bewitched with these pestilent persuasions
of his wiked rulers as thus saying. Consider oh* king) thou art but one man and
ignorant of this matter / thou must give faith to the learned doctors and so the
sayers which be ever at the goddis mouths and at (...) handis / in the n^we
and soden mutacion of these realms it is to hard for the to pla^t any new
religion and to abolish the old customs. It will gender sedicions and vprores
and miche inquitenes in thy realm / put away therefore these new learned with
their new letning / or tarry tyla more quiet time, till it may be beter borne
of your commons and lordis. Siche enemies to god and his word shall good
princes neuerwant. They laid against the king the ferme auctorite of his actis
and laws saying, it should be a perellose example and to boldean enterprise to
make any innouacions and changes of the old religion laudable customs rites
cere. etc. At last therefore the king ouercomen by the importune wiked
persuasions of these perverse cou^sellers permitted to them their mischeuouse
dryft. Nethe less a christian prince ought to have a princely and manly heart in
gods cause and of no weakness to give place to his maliciouse magistrates and
priestis. Be ought himself to take the book of the law in his own hand / to
study and be learned above all his Magis bisshops and counsel to. But because
this king sinned not of a set purpose willingly / therefore a non was he smiten
with pity and repentance / but so were not the false accusers of daniel and
the wiked counselors. It folowth therefore that the king repented with so manly
a faith that he punisshed these accusers and his cou^sellers of this perellouse
nouite and mutacion put into his head so ungodly. Would God all emperors and
kings would practice this Darius his example.

They be persewers which nether love / Persewers.
nor will hear / nor reverence the true doctrine / nor will suffer themselves
to be taught / nor study to profit therein / nether will defend the teachers
and prechers thereof / nether suffer it to be setforth / which themselves know
it to be trwe and godly. But had leauer to bury and burn it and bring it into
hatered and sclaunder. Let these men thus synninge against the holy ghost look
never to repent / but to have the present judgment of God over them. And these
dampnable wretches Titu^. 3.
Paul bids us aftir once and the second warning to es^ie we as heretics /
for they be condemned by their own testimonye. Let kings therefore by Darius
his example aknowleg their infirmities and study strongly to go forth with
the verite / and pray with him that said: Lord Mar. 9.
I believe but yet help my unbelief.

Then the king going into his palace went to bed souperlesse / no meat brought
him / he slept not that night / as soon as it was day sight the king arose
and went spedely to the den of the lions / and being thereat / he with a
moorninge voice called daniel saying: Oh daniel the servant of the living god
/ has not ye power of thy god whom always thou have worshipped, delivered the
from the lyo^s? Anon daniell answered the king sainge / oh king ever moughst
thou live: My god has sent me his angel which has closed up the lions
mouths that they should not hurt me. For before him am I found innocent /
nether against the / oh king have I committed any fawlte. Then was the king
excedengly ioifull and commanded daniel to be plukt out of the den / in whom
now plukt out, there was no hurt found done to him of the lions because he
believed in his god. Then at the kings commandment were his accusers and
enemies brought forth / which with their children and wives were throne into yt
lions whom ere they could come to the floer of the den / the lions took them
/ and broke all their bones.

The cruel unreasonable lions were meker to Daniel then his own fellows. The
merciable king got mercy of god and repented: he departed from these his
wyked counselerswith great heuines / he refused all meat mirthe and solace
consyderinge his so faithful a counselor and servant of god thus to be
entreated. Of this example may some of our bisshops and some Christian princes
be asshamed / themselves in all delicat excess and wealth to see daysy the
innocent blood shed for the truth and their subiectis for their salfgard, and
defense of their realms to be slain / themselves in the mean time playing and
banketing. Daniels wordis to the king thus teach him. Oh king / of this may
thou learn the justice of god / before whom I am found innocent in this matter
and have not offended the. I had trewly offended the grievously / if I had
worshipped yt with my peticions and prayers for so had I confirmed the in thy
nowne sins* making the to believe thine act to have been godly. Now the king
aftir his repentance and gladness conceived / begins to i^g^iustelyer / he
commands the innocent to be drawn out from the lyo^s and his false accusers
to be throne unto them. And for because they went about to deprrue the king of
his most wise counselor and best beloved friend / therefore did the king
justly punisshe these false accusers with their best beloved wives and
children. But wherefore was daniel delivered? Because he believed / (says the
text) in his God. I cannot se else now a days wherefore men be persecuted and
brent, casten into our lordely lions mouths, but because they believe in their
God one alone for all sufficient / for their faith only in him to be
justified, of him only to depend / to him only to pray / him only to call
upon etc. and upon no saint nor non else to worship / no not images. It was
nether the kings repentant heuines / nor his fasting and watching / nor yet
daniels innoce^cie / nor prayers An example to be noted and followed of kings.
that closed up ye lions mouths: but it was christ ye messager of his heavenly
father / because daniel believed in him. Here be emperors and kings taught to
retract and call in again their unjust laws / actis articles / decrees and
proclamacio^s / and to punisshe the counselors and auctours of siche actis.
Which ensample all hinges ought this day diligently to look upon. Also all
siche ungodly actis and laws we be bound with daniel to not obey / but rather
to fly out of the land then to be yoked with them. Sely innocent daniel was
casten into the lions / signifying the innocent poor church of god ever to
have the most s^^ong empreours / kings and princes and the devil to, with the
pope and all his lions to be hyrpers^wers. To be brief. Darius and daniel be
serforth to us the example of the mercy of god / and daniels accusers are
thexample of ye wrath of god. The example of Darius first teaches the office
of a crystiane to repent, to believe, and to aknowleg his sins aftir the law
and gospel / and to save the godly and dampne the ungodly. The king without
meat and sleep all the day and night continues. For the law is as it were a
fyery veper ever bighting / even yt comminacion of god saying: I shall viset
thy sins: for the king against his faith and conscience had commanded daniel
to be destroyed for kepinge the first precept of god. He thus commanded it / not
as the king and lord / but as an idolater and murderer of innocents. But the
king to see daniel a live conceived no less* miracle in his conscience then
was the delyuerance of daniels body. Great therefore is the joy of ye
faithful / aftir their cross thus to se god to preserve and glorifye them.

Then king Darius unto the people Text.
and nations all tongues upon the universal earth thus writes. Miche peace be
with you. Of me it is decreed that in all the parties of my realm all men
shall fear and dread the god of daniel / for that he is the living god
abiding for ever and ever / for his kingdom shall never be destroid but his
dominion ever must endure / who helps and delyuereth* he shows his
wondrefull miracles in heaven and earth which delivered daniel from the lions.
Aftir this daniel was highly promoted in the kingdom of Darii and in the realm
of Cyrithe persiane.

See how God will have the victory? see unto what end God has permitted
these injuries to daniel. The king would be puffed up with glory. His divines and
nobles flater him / the just is casten to the lions / and god the judge of all
is not known But now at last his glory is declared clerer then the son. And
the king with publyk rescript and open reca^tacion confessinge his sin,
sets forth the glory of god. Nebucadnezar commanded that the name of God in
nowyse shuldbe blasphemed. Darius here wills it to be feared and worshipped
and all men to tremble and fear at the face of the god of daniel. As though he
should say: Let our actis and laws / decrees or proclamacions whether they
be of myself or of any other made / bind noman / if they command any thing
against the god of daniel. For myself at last have I learned whereto laws be
holy and when they should be dispensed with / Miche more just it is that God be
rather obeyed then man. I am but a man mortal dust and ashes. It is God that
lives for ever which punissheth and rewards. His face fear ye / him serve
and reverence. He lives and reigns present when men think him to be absent.
And awaketh when he is thought to sleep. Who would not have despayered of
daniels life* And yet so / for his faith is he delivered from the lions hongry
mouths / let us follow things certain and leave lyinge vanities. Many
miracles has god done in heaven and earth / but of this one may we be taught
his power and goodness. Now the king rebukes his error and the holy prophet
before contempned / he exalts into great glory. And takes daniel with him
into the land of Mede leaving Cyrum and his sone Cambysem at Babylon. Thus
would god aftir the cross glorifye his servant.

The lions signifye the mighty enimyes The lions.
of crystis church / as has the Psalm. My soul lives among lions. Of god
only for our faith in christ our delyuerer / are their mouths and tyrannouse
power stopped, And as christ then in the form of an angel preserved daniel /
even so now being man and intercessour before the father / he with his present
spirit preserves his church in the middis of these lions his cruel enemies.
Here be we learned none to be exalted of god onelesse he before be casten down
into the dens of lyo^s. For psa. 109. Romans 6.
christ might not lift up his head except by the way he had dronken of the
roaring river. Nether shall the cristians arise unto life eternal except they be
first dead and buried. Whosoever ever therefore thou be thus for the trwth accused
and handled as daniel, not only se that thou thus singe unto thy god (whilis
thou be ^est me thou make me great) but also have thou faith and confidence,
knowing the same shortly to be fulfilled in thy accusers and persewers that
came upon daniels accusers. They shall be trapped and taken in their own snares
and fall into ye pit which themselves had dug up: But I (says the
faithful shall pass by* harmeles. How can we want these examples in the
congregacions so full of consolacion? If Daniel be diligently red ye shall see
him to have been the figure of crystis passion and his glorificacion by his
resurreccion. This story of Dary also ought to be set before all the princes
eyes of the world to teach them repentance to believe / to profess the trwth,
to revoke their errors, and false and ungodly laws, actis, articles,
constitucions and institucions or enstruccions / to co^serue the trw worshipers
and beleuers, and also to se that all their chirches have good prechers of the
word / which is the chief office of every king / and to see the^ brought up
in the very trwe enstruccions and doctrine of christ and his apostles. Now to
the second book of daniel and seventh chapter.

Now daniel returns bake. 3. years The argument of the *7.
teching us not what other men / but what himself did see to come unto the
worldis end. What changes of kingdoms and what persecucions the chosen should
suffer until the eternal kingdom of christ should come to us. He tells here
the vision showed to himself wherbye he prophecieth the affliccions of the
people of god under the 4. Monarchies to be suffered / and how that the Roman
empire at last divided and shaken in here erthen feeble feet, anticryste
inuading Chrystis church / should persecute it unto the worldis end. And at
last christ comen to judgment should destroy him: that the faithful with christ
(all their ennemis taken away) might reign and dwell in peace for ever. In this
7. chap. the same thing is showed which was seen of Nebucad. in the. 2. chap.
albeit under other wordis and in another form or vision / save that here
daniel clearly prophecieth of the seclare Anticrystis / of the popis /
Mahumetis and of the Turkis Antichristen kingdo^s to be sprongen up out of the
Roman empire. Let us hear the text.

In the first year of Beltsazar king Text.
of Babylon daniel had a dream and a Chap. 7.
vision of his head in his bed. Whose some he writes in these wordis. I
daniel saw in the night / the four wyndes of heaven fyghting and making great
co^mocie^s upon the great sea. And. 4. great beastis one ayenste another were
ascended out of the sea. And the first was like a lion having egles wings. And
I looked upon him whylis his wings were plucked from him / and himself casten
out of the land: but yet standinge on his fete erected like a man / and a
manis mind was given him. And behold / the second beast was like a bear
standing in the one side / having. 3. morsels in his mouth betwixt his tethe.
Unto whom they said: Arise and devour thou miche flesh. Then yet I looked /
and so I saw another like a leoparde having. 4. swyft wings on his bake /
this beast had. iiii. horns / and unto him was given power to rule. After this
I looked in the night / and behold / I saw the fowrth beast / a beast ferefull
and terrible / and meruelouse strong / which had great tethe of (...) / he
devoured and consumed / and the leauinges he trod under his feet. This beast
being like non of all the other former / had. x. horns.

This vision seen in the night with so many cruel beastis so fyghting upon the
sea is ferefull / signifying the church of God to suffer affliccions and
greuouse persecucio^s under the. 4. monarchies laboring in the derk ignorance
of god and his word. This lion signified the golden head and kingdom of
Babylon under whom the people of god especially those. lxx. years suffered
greuouse affliccions. A lion The lyo^ of Baby lon.

yea and unto blodsheding in batail. The same kingdom in Ezechiel is called the
four formed beast / first like a lion for their hardines / in subdewinge their
aduersaris / and like an egle / for their swyftnes in their businesses / like
an ox for their constancy in labors to be sustained / and like a man for
their prudence in things to be before seen. The which conditions kings and
magistrates ought to have. Of this lion said Ierem. 4. There is comen up a lion
out of his cowche. Innumerable affliccions suffered the Jews under this lions
blody tyranny / as themselves complayn saying: Upon the floudis of Babylon we
sat and wept whiles we remembered zion. This lions. 2. wings were the two
peples of the Chaldeis and Assyrians. They were smyten of / and the lion c^sten
out of the land / when ye Persians subdewed them. To be then elevated to
stand up as a man, signifies that kingdom in Nebucadnez. and his sons days
to be exalted to ye knowledge of God / and their kingdom thereby to be glorified.
But in fine / the mind of a fraill man was given to it in Beltsazar / which in
his beastly securite perisshed and lost ye golden head and so bold a lyo^s

persecuted under the leoparde following / yet for the chirches counfort was this
Persi^ bear slain of Alexander the great. And so was the Persi^ kingdom
translated unto the grekis. The leoparde is the Macedonik Monarchye.


The leoparde or spotted panthere expressing the nature and wits of the gre

the 4 successors of alexander / by whose help in so short a time he subdewed
to himself all the world. For the story witnesses king ptolome to have had

and far be yende to have co^quired: and albeit this greek sprekled panthere
had so great a power and dominion, so mightily horned and headed / and so
swyftely winged / yet because this beast abused his power in breking the
commandments of god and namely of the first table and in persecuting his
church so cruelly by Antiochus epiphanes / he was destroid miserably and the
kingdom translated to the fowrth beast / that is unto the Roman empire.

This fowrth ferefull Roman beast is described terribly / hugly strong / armed
The last beast is the Roman e^pyre.
with tethe of devouring and tearing flesh and bones even the same that is
seen in the 2. chapter called the leggis of whose fete were partly and part
potbakt earth. For what else signify these words, with so terrible a sownde
then the empire of Rome not only with the most hard batails at home and with
out, of themselves and of strangers, to be consumed and destroid / but also the
same most cruelly to persecute crystes church and to destroy utterly and
irreparably the jews policye for ever and their nation. By the leauings or
remenants / understand the last part of this monarchy / his fete signifye
the last emperors of it. This beast to trede under his fete the leauings /
signifies / the later end of this kingdom to have the most crueltyes and
calamites brought over it by ye pope / and at last by the turk. For how
greuonsly has Italye been torn and rent almost these. 900. years / of the
Gottis / of the grekis / longobards and of owr empero wrs? But why is this
beast unlike all the other former? verily this empire must dure longer then the
2. and the third monarchy and all the ungodliness and persecucion done
distinctly and severally in the the other / shall be gathered to gither and
committed of this beast. And the last emperors and popis of this empire shall
vex and persecute the church longer and cruellier then any of the other.

His 10 horns signifye the chief provinces The. 10. horns. Job. 29. Mat. 2^
and realms under the Roman empire. Which were very many. For the nownber of
10 signifies a great multitude as in Job. See / ten times that is greatly ye
have confounded me. And Christ lykeneth the kingdom of heaven to 10 virgens. So
that the meaning is / that the Roman empire should have amplier and moo
provinces then the other former. Orels take the 10 horns / for Italy Spain
France / Germany / Illyrik / Greece / Affrik / Egypt / Asia / Syria. For the
countries annexed unto these 10 must be rekened with them / as Pannonia
adioining to Illyrik / and Macedonia joined to Greece.

And whylis I considered these horns Text.
/ lo / there grew up another little horn among them of whom. 3. of the
former horns were plukt out. And behold there were horns in this horn as the
eyes of a man and a mouth speakinge stout and great things.

This lytest horn was and is the Anticrysten kingdom of the popes of Rome
with all their unclean clergy by little and little at their begininge creping up
from so low a state into so high dignities / power and possessions under
themperours, and their. x. other horns / sown out of the serpents sead into
every corner of the world / flyinge like locustes into every emperors and
kings bosom either to be their confessers / counselors / prechers or
teachers: out of pore scoles and cloisters are these beggars cropen up above
emperors and kings by their serpentine flatering frauds and holy hypocrysie.
And as daniel here sees. 4. beastis ascending Apoc. 13.
out of the sea / so does Joan, resoning the same vision see the same beast
arysing up like wise out of the sea. But the cruel forms and facions which
daniel saw in ye Daniel compared with the Apocalypse. Apoc. 17.
three beastis / the same altogyther sees I can in this one hugly beast sayng.
And the beast whom I saw / was like a leoparde / and his feet as beres fete /
and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. He sees him also with. y. horns /
which he expowneth to be. x. kings / which had not yet in Ioans days receyved
their kingdoms / but should then in time to come / as kings in an hour take
their power. For sone aftir by the frauds of this little horn the empire of
Rome was (as ye see it) divided into feet and toes / as Nebucadnezar did see it
to come / which is and shall be the ^uine and fall of the hole empire. Of this
division and skateringe thereof / Paul in Neros time gave (as it were) a watch
word and warning before sayng He that holds the empire / let him hold it
fast now yet a while / till it be taken away. 2. Tes. 2
For even then / says Paul / was he working his secret anticrysten mischief
and wykednes. In somich as Joan anon aftir Paul said. And even now are their
many anticrystes: which are gone forth 1. Ioa^. 2.
of us / but yet were they non of us. Lo here may ye see this beast to be no
stranger / borne farrof / for Paul says / he sits in the temple of god / he
is therefore a domesty enimye, a tame beast not to be sought among the Turkis /
Jews and Sarace^s as our bisshops would make us believe whylis themselves play
this beastis, part under our noses at home in the temple of god / and not in
the temples of the Turkis and Jews. They tell us / where the head emperors
and kings be crystened and they of their counsel and teachers / there can be no
persecucion by Anticryst / but all is just execucion / lo. But John and daniel
say that he should putforth his horns under the wings of all the other
christian kings even among christian men in the church of christ / in crystis
name against christ his name and his faithful to make bataill. Here it apereth
John to say the same that daniel says / but yet in other wordis. For where as
in this place daniel saw a beast armed with. 3. great teth devouring and
consuminge all / the same did Joan see taking his tyranny / cruel power /
his proud seat and his mischeuouse majesty of the dragon ye devil / being a
blody murderer and a liar from the beginning.

Again where Joan speaks of the beast Apoc. 13.
with. x. horns / he adds to him another beast ascending from the earth seen
of him to have two horns like a lamb / but he spoke as did the dragon / and
executed all the power of the former beast in his sight. The. x. horned beast
ascending out of the sea is the spiritual Anticryst of Rome The spi rituall
anticrist
having himself with all his laws / rytes / tradicions / decrees and doctrine
defended of the emperors sword and with the swerdis of all these kings once
given to drink of his golden cup of poison.

Among these his strong defenders and mighty horns he arose first / but a
little horn / until they deuolued unto him their powers possessions and
autorities to slaye the sayntis / and then was he a mighty worthy. x. horned
blody whore of Babylon. But at last / the gospel once reveled / it did pluk
from her head her holy vysare of hypocrisy and gave her in her most high and
holy head a deadly wound: had not his cardinallis / bishops and friars strewed
into every emperors court and kings hawlis / spedely putto the plaster in
rolling and tossing the ball again unto the seculare powers flatering them with
the popis tytles / power / possessions / and auctorite to maintayn and defend
all the popes ceremonis / tradicions doctrynes more sewerly confirmed with the
seclare emperors actis and articles The beastis wound healed of his own

and defended with sword and fire cruellier then ever they were under the pope
himself. For the healing of this wound one horn was called the most sacred
caesar / another the most christian / another the most catholyke / and another his
first begoten some / and another / defender of the faith etc. Which clerkely
cure of the clergy when Joan had espied / lo / said he / I see another beast

earth with two horns / etc. meaning the seculare antichristen emperors and
kings having now two horned powers / both their own and the spiritual
auctorite / as they had first / and all to persecute the gospel now of late
offered them and to burn the professors and prechers thereof. And it is to be
feared / lest the Turk be also this two horned seculare Anticryst ascended out
of the earth. For I dare say: That rather then ye gospel should be freely
received and the pope with his spiritual sourgens be brydled or suppressed
with ye word of God / their state and living corrected and reformed there at /
the emperors and kings crystened / consenting and co^pellinge these little
whorishe horns to dance aftir the poor painful pype of ye gospel / they
had leifer ten. Turkis to invade (and if their selves bring him not in) and to
reign over all crystendom / then one christian king. For they had leyuor be
under Mahumet and his laws / then under the christian kings and emperors and
under the holy gospel of christ For under the Turk / they yet conceive some
hope either by tribute geuinge / or by their old hypocritish holy flatering
frauds to stand still in their dignites glory / riches / possessions and
auctorite. But in both these beastis their cruel horns are increased (take
them for whom ye will) for both the Turk and Mahumete in Asia and Aphrica /
and the Pope with his false prophets and falser cardinals and bishops with all
their coniured and sworn seculare papistis in Europa / have gotten them a
mighty perellous power against christ is poor fely lambs as ye see in their
commandments / decrees / articles / actis and proclamacio^s and inquisicions
for bokis and heresies as they call goddis word / to be prohibited pressed
down / and burned with all the promouers thereof / under the Turk they have
some hope to stand still in their lusts and plesures / but under the gospel
of christ they be like to lose all and their kingdom to have a miscrable fall.

Before this / daniel saw the last Monarchy which was the empire of Rome to
be divided into many kingdo^s as perchance into France / Portugal / Spain
Pole / Denmark / England / Hyerlande Scotland / Napels / Boheme and Hungarye
/ which be the. x. horns / and seen of John / by the. x. horns / helping the
read Romish beast to suppress the kingdom Apoc. 17.
of christ. For by the popis policies / thus was the noble empire skatered into
her own destruction / that this little horn might have the proye and
preeminence over the hole empire. This little horn says daniel grew up among
these. x. kingdoms or. x. seculare horns / by whose ayed riches and auctorite
/ the pope with his prelates ascended from poor buggerly beggarly friars and
flaterers unto siche an imperial majesty above emperors and kings. And here
daniel sees. 3. horns smyten of from these so many kings by the little horn
/ That is / the Anticrysten pope to make weak and feeble whatsoever emperor
and king he listed / depose them at his pleasure and to translate ye empire and
kingdoms into his own nettis to use and occupy them himself. Or if ye will
take the. iii. horns prescisely for. 3 empires or kingdoms falsely usurped of
the pope / behold upon his head the triple The. iii. horns casten down of
the pope.
crone infaming himself to be the throerdowne and destroyer or robber of three
great kingdoms / yea and even the subuerter of the hole Roman empire. Netheles
his flaterers yet make him believe that he is emperor and king over haeuen /
over ye earth and of purgatory / yea and over hell and devil to. But this is
truth. He once translated the empire from the east to the weest / and from the
French men to the Germans. And now contendeth he to translate it to the Turk
/ which shall be his last translacion and his own destruction with the heuey
mutacions of all the west kingdoms / if he can bring his blody purpose to pass.

For Daniel says this little horn to have eyes like manis eyes / that is to be
prudent and polytyk to look for his own ease and lucre. For he thinks to
get more under the Turk then under the gospel if it be received of the
emperors and of all the christian kings as he fears it will be. John gives him
horns like a lamb That is to say / he shall do all his fraudelent featis
under a meruelouse pretense of holiness innocencye and mekenes. For he shall
write himself the most holy / when he shall show himself by his dedis to be ye
most wyked profane cruel wolue comen in shepis clothes / for under ye title
of Papa: father of fathers he is ye most marciles tyrant of all tyrants / under
the name of Summi or Maximi pontificis / that is of the most high and greatest
vigilant watcher and ouerseer of his flok / he is the most negligent idest
idol and dome dog / under ye name of pastor / which is a flok feder / he is
the most pestelent poysoner. And even these be the two (...). horns signified
by ye two forked bisshops myters / although (say they) they signifye the two
testame^ts / and that they be learned in nether of them both. Now when ye see
this beast to deuolue these his holy tytles and godly names of innocence and
meaknes to any seclare horn or beast ascending out of the earth / and the same
do take them, executing the Popis power and tyranny in persecutinge the
gospel and to confirm papistrye, speking / writing / decreing / articlyng and
enacting etc. as did the dragon / then take heed for then contendeth this
beast to heal his own deadly head wound agene. The two horns like lambs
horns be both the powers seculare and ecclesiast^^ either in any one spiritual
or in any one seculare Anticryst.

Also it is to be noted. That both Daniel and Joan says he has a mouth
speking great blaphemies / or proud arrogancies against god / he shall speak as
did the dragon even blaphemies against god / as did he that said I will asce^de
and belyke the most highest god. And as did the serpent persuade Eve to not
believe god but to think the most trwe god to be a dissembler or a liar. The
turk and Mahumet speak great blaphemies against god in their alkaron. But owr
little whore of Rome and her cardinals bishops and prechers speak the most
gretest and greuoust blasphemies of all and themselves defend them with fire
and cause their seculare anticristis to defend them with sword. They be not
ashamed to write and teache the pope to be of syke power with christ / the pope
cannot err / the pope to be the supreme head and spowse of the church and
vicare of christ. And because he has the imperial power / he may distribute
the kingdoms and riches of the world as he list and because he is the highest
bishop he may give all the chirches benifices as cardinallships bysshopryks
and benefices to whom he list / and he bosteth the gospel to be subject to
his interpretacion and understanding / yea and except (say some of owr
bishops) that the scripture be confirmed by siche ordinary powrs / it is no
scripture nor may not be redd, but of siche as they list to deliver and
lyce^ce it / nor in any other tongue then they list to give it us. He will
have his law and tradicions to be observed above gods laws and the
transgressors of his lowsey laws to be greuouslier punisshed then the brekers
of gods precepts. He bosteth himfelf to make laws and articles of owr faith
and to add mo sacraments to them then christ made / and to consecrate and to
make the body of christ / to send away the substance of the bread / the
accidents as the whigtnes rowndes / taste and other qualities and qua^tities
remaining. He confesses crist with his lips to be a red emer but yet he
techeth / he does and writes many great blaphemies contrary to the mystery of
owr redemption / as in his purgatory / satisfaccions / merits (...) and siche
other. All these blaphemies speaks he under lambs skins in an innocent holy
pretense, having horns like a lamb / he will apere humble like any other
inferior man and yet shameth he not to open his mouth to speak greuouse
blasphemies against god and his people. This 2. these. 2.
beast Paul handles, and his pestele^t pro pertyes he treateh saying. This
sinful man and forlorn child, adversary to god will be exalted against god /
and above his worship cleame and vsurp a worship to himself and teache a certain
vtwarde reverent behavior to idols and images, so that he will sit in the
temple of god oste^ting and bosting himself setforthe for a god / that is / he
will with his laws, decrees, actis, articles, and doctrine sit deper in
menis consciences and more feared then god himself with his ten commandments
and all his terrible comminacions. Is it not an heavy blasphemye to teache,
write, and decree that himself may with his fire and sword prevent and
disapoynt god of his everlasting and immutable providence? But at last / when
the little horns iniquite is disclosed / then shall he against his will render
again his prossessions titles and his falsely usurped auctorite to ye seclare
horns, out of whom first by fraud and hypocrisy he so craftily extorted
them. Thus ye see that by this little horn and by the horned best seen of
Joan, be vnderstande^ the Anticristen adversaries of christ and his church,
whether they be the seclare kings and emperowrs, popes or bisshops / turk or
Mahumete or these all together coniured against the lord and his anointed. It
is more then two thousand The difference betwixt the turk and anticrist.
years sense daniel saw these visions / with albeit the fathers by this little
horn understood rightly anticryste / yet because althingis then to come in
these prophecies / were not seen so clerly as they be now paste / and in
fulfilling in these owr present days seen and felt of every faithful / some
men conjecture / this little horn to be the Turk / albeit the popis and their
prelatis have justly played the turkis part hitherts. For the turk and
anticrist differ not but as the devil differs from hell By this little
prominent horn therefore Ioa^ draconite.
Doctor Johan Draconite understands the kingdom of the Saracens / of the
turk and of Mahumete sprongen up in the dissipacion of the Roman monarchy /

place / of the power and doctrine of this saracene Turkish kingdom. Of the time /

whereby doutles he signifies / the Roman prouynces then lying in the east to
be fallen from the empire / for these; horns that is to say; kingdoms Egypt /
Siria / and the regions of Cilicia / the Sarace^s had then anon joined
together. But albeit now the turks have many moo provinces yet is it not
against the text* describing only but the beginning of the Sarace^s or turkis
kingdom. Of his power / for daniel says. These; horns were with great Off his

violence plucked out / oh it is to trwe / that hole Aphrika / a great part of
Asia / and not little of Europa be holden this day of the turk and of his
Tartarion god mahumete. Ezec. 38. and 39.
Ezechiel prophecieth / this fyerce Scythi^ beast and pestilence of all
crystendom / in the last age of the world to destroy the church and at last
to be destroid in the mountans of Israel / that is either in the places where
the gospel sowneth, or of those knyghtis which calv^po^ the name of the lord
god in faith. Of Off his doctrine
his doctrine. Daniel says that this horn has the eyes of a man and a mouth
speking great and stowte things which if ye will see / read his Alcorane: which
whosoever desyere to know I shall give him in this to read / that he may know that
this devils nills mouth Mahumete utterly abolissheth all the writings of the
prophets and apostles even the testimonies of owr salvation and help. He
fayneth christ to be no beter then Moses / and in nowyse will he aknowleg him
to be the savior. And if he has any cyuile justice yet is it corrupted with
abominable filthye lecherye. wherefore / because not only with sword and wepens
he decreth the sayers and doers against his wyked doctryn to be destroyed but al
so he will be extolled above al thig called god / therefore is this little horn
thought to be no little part of anticrists kingdom.

Hitherto has Daniel prosecuted his own visio^s of the succession of the 4
empires / and that the image in ye 2 cap. and those 4 beastis here signifye not
only ye seculare emperowrs and king is fighting among themselves one against a
another and all against god / but also the spiritual anticryst persecuting the
church of christ. For the later kings shall most cruelly trede down the
gospel in her vprysing as ye have seen it these 600 years paste, whilis they
with their emperowrs played the popis ha^gmen excersing their own tyranny and
executing his cruel ungodly laws and anticristen doctrine by burning and
slaying whilis they prosecuted his and their own horrible blody desyers upon
crystis church for the defense of the popis and their own tradicions rites and
articles acts etc. to confirm their idolatry and supersticio^ For so has
this little horn bewitched her 10 horns about her / that she has persuaded
and put into their headis, the holy scriptures in owr vulgar tongues to be
heresye, and the faithful fre prechers heretics, and therefore to banissh and
burn them both, and to bring into the chirches, bisshops bokis of new and
wyked institucions and unwholesome erudicions with their own arrogant actis
armed articles with sword and fire. The the true token of the church.
chief and trwest token of the trw church is the profession and preching of
the prophetical and apostoli doctrine. And to fight against this doctrine or to
abolissh it / is the very sign of anticristes Synagog. The pope and his
seclare sort usurp a power and worship above christ / in that with the most
arroga^t audacite they dare alter / interpret, add, and minishe and expowne
gods laws and gospel at their plesures and to be siche lordis over his faith
and religion / that of gods holy perpetual verite and mighty word they will
aftir their own carnal affectis, to serve their own lustis, make it a nose of
wax to warm and feed their synful desyers* yea gods word and gospel is not
gods word except they so admit and allow it. It is heresy / n^w lerning yea
and treason to / the word ofsedicion and disobedience if they so say it. Oh
blody blasphemers / oh arrogant anticristes. Be not these a comparison of ye
Mahumetes doctrine and of the popis.
your proud mouths speking proud and horrible blasphemies? The turk and
Mahumete utterly renownce all that in the gospel techeth christ to be the fone
of god / and even so do they that will be justified by their own merits: mahumete
knows not the doctrine of faith or of ye trw inuocacion and worship / no more
do the spiritual and seculare anticristis which yet do persecute it / only
do Mahumete and the turk hold with owr anticrystis certain civil precepts /
at their own pleasurs (as do the called crystians) to stablissh and to abolish
them when and (...) they list: but yet is the turk more constant and ciuily
just in his laws then be the called cristians. The turk and his Mahumete
grawnt sinful lecherose lustis / owr turk and Mahumete wink / yea they laughe
at the same / forbiddig just matrymony / and rending in sondre lawfully married
persons and permitting open whoredom. Mahumete with violence of sword
compels men to his religion and the same do owr Mahumetis.

Now sees every man / this mighty horned beast to be the triple anticristen
kingdom standinge upon the popis and their ^^ ergy / upon the seculare horns
dronken with his cup / and upon the Turkish Mahumet. But this little horn
differs from the ten horns in that it has eyes like a man pretendinge all
religionse devotion and holiness in his doings, wrytings, and sayings: for
under the pretense of a reformacion defense and restoring of the christian
religion / he would destroy it / and settle Anticryst the faster / which
property Joan expresses saying his horns to be like (...) horns for that
under shepis and lambs skynnes he shall hyde himself lurking a blody ^yo^ and
a fyerce bear. The vtwarde behauiors of the Turkis in their temples and lyuinge
seems godly. They pray fine times a day / they use diverse sprinklings and
wasshings as we do with holy water / they enclyne most devoutly when they
pray / they lie prostrat / they abstain from wine / they eat their meat upon
the ground they will have no curiose nor costly howses / they viset the
temples often / they abhor uncleanness / they loathe and detest images / wherein
they be miche beter then the called crystians. Who saying this their de^oute
religion in sight would not take them for godly men without gall and
arrogancye? Likewise in the papisti church / what a multitude and variete is
there of laudable, in syghte, ceremonis / decent rytes / what continual
praying / singing / playing of sweet instruments / daily (...) sing? How
outragiously are their preistes and chirches orned and gorgiously garnisshed in
their popetry pass times and apes play* what is there in gold / silver / and
in costly aparell / as apes in purpure how iette they? How many festival high
days to worship saints have they made themselves to call poor men from their
daily labors and lucre, to serve their idle belys to stand and wonder upon
Ioans camel cote, and to gaze and stare upon these apes in gold / veluets and
preciouse stones and upon their vain pictures and idle images? Behold their
habits / vestures / shauinges / hypocrisye / chosen holiness / feigned and
facioned demure countenances / holy ^okes / and humane eyes / and thou woldst
swear / them to be rather angels (I say not of satan) then men. But the
prophet adds / that as in ye horn there apereth to be an honest eye and a
lambish look / so has he a blasphemouse mouth / speking great arrogant things
which Joan expowning says. He shall speak as did the dragon and devil
himself / to obscure Gods glory and his holy name / till with the brethe of
his mouth he be slain. Wherefore to counforte us here yet molested and
persecuted with these cruel horns. Daniel says.

But yet I beheld / until the cheyers Text.
and stoles were set / and the man of Apoc. 1. and5. Exo. 24
many years was setdowne / whose vesture was as whight as snow / and the
hear of his head as fine and pure as woll / whose seat royal was all on a
fyerie flamme / and the whelis thereof burned like fire / and there went long
fyery beams like a floude offyer flouwing out of him / and thousand thousands
ministered unto him / and ten thousand thousands stood before him. And anon as
he was set down to judgment / the bokis were laid open.

Hitherto ye see all daniels vision verefyed concerning these. 4. beastis and
monarchies and this little horn / so that we need not to seek any other
exposicion of daniels and Ioans visions / then the daily experiences in
beholding the face of the world which is a plain commentary upon them both.
And of the present verefying hitherto and fulfilling of these visions / we may
be certain and sewer that the rest of their prophecies shall verily come to
pass shortly / ere these seatis be set down / and these forked horned kings
trones be taken away. For verily christ is even now preparinge these judgment
seatis / to destroy these wyked Anticrysten horns and to cast them into
perpetual fyery torments / and to enbrace his chosen thus cruelly of these
beastis oppressed receiving us unto perpetual joy For this is / lo / the end
of this tragedye / thus gothe out their play even then when they think to be
but in ye middis of their matter. For daniel and Joan both knyt up Anticrystis
reign in half a time or in half an hebdomade conforting us in that they shall be
shortly taken away / and shall not vex us so long as they think to do /
wytnes the psalm. But thou oh lord shall psalm. 54.
pluk them down into the pit of death / even these blody men and crafty
deceivers which shall not come to half the days wherein they think to live to
execute their mischief. And agene. When thou psalm. 91.
see these sinful blody men florishe like flouers / then be thou sewer /
themal to florisshe for no another end then for ever to be smyten down. And
therefore says daniel Use. 12.
aftir some textis. He shall take his pleasure for a time for times and but for
half a time. And Joan windeth up the half time in half an hebdomade / which
be. iii. ycares and an half / for God is not angrywith us always / but in the
middis of their wyked course his adversaries shall fall down into their own
perpetual destruction and payns. For daniel saw the days of our tribulacion
shortened for our counforte / and for their confusion that trouble us. There
shall be no full end of our persecucions and tribulacions nor of the Turkis
crueltye until christ set down his seatis to judgment wherein we shall be
blessed and the ungodly persewers of crystis church dampened for ever as Paul
conforteth the martyrs of Thessalonie. And therefore ye prophets use but few
wordis / for there is no word 2. these. 1. and. 2.
of god so little / but it is mightiet then all the world / nether any so little
a letter in the prophetis which sauoreth not either of the law or of the
gospel. Wherefore because it is certain / that of daniel the descripcion of the
judgment / is here setforth into the consolacion of the crystians and into the
fear of the Anticrysten / we will (that the troubled church might see her
confort) say our mind briefly according to the scriptures of the judgment of
christ*

These seatis are said to be set / for ye Mat. 19.
confort of them which yet suffer for the gospels sake under these horned
kingdo^s as christ told his apostles sayng: ye shall sit upon the twelve
seatis to judge the twelf trybis of Israel. And if we suffer with christ / we
shall reign with christ. Romans 8.
Christ is called here the great aged God and man / for he is an eternal savior
promised in paradise before he was borne. To sit / pertains to christ the
judge as in Matthew. 25. Be shall sit in the trone of his glory / and before him
shall all nations Paul To viii.
be brought. Forthermore / a judge has a double office (as says Peter) to
punisshe the evil and to defend the good. Wherefore here does Daniel by the
whightnes his whit clothes.
of christ his vesture and pureness of his hear describe his confortable
defense of the good men. For as he in his whight clothes clarifyed in his
transfiguracion and also rising from death apered ioyouse and glad to the heuey
penitent sinners / even so shall he make glad his glorified chosen once risen
from death with this voice: Come ye yt blessed of my father etc. Siche a beutye
of the church in christ is painted also in the. 45. psalm. but it is not seen in
this miserable vale of weping teres / as Joan says / we be not yet seen as we
shall be. The heuey vengeance of the Ris fla^mey trone what it signifies. Joel.
2.
evil men is painted by ye flammye trone and long fyery beams procedinge
therout. For deuouering fire shall go before him / and a burninge flame aftir
him (Ioele to wytnes) and as christ arysing was seen so terrible to ye kepers of
his sepulcre / even so shall he apere a ferrefull judge to all ungodly in the
last judgment saying / avoid fro me ye cursed into eternal fire. Also ye
multitude of mynisters is taken for his infinite noumber of angels as Mat. 25.
says: all the angels shall come down with him. To sit in judgment is to
render to every one according to their dedis as speaks Paul: Nether is it any
thing else / the books to be opened / then that Paul says. In that day god
shall lay open ye Romans 2.
secret hid thingis of menis hertis by Jesus 1. Cor. 4.
christ according to my gospel. Wherefore there is no difference betwixt daniel
and Paul save that as they both wrote not in one time so did they not with the
same wordis express the same judgment of christ.

Then I beheld / namely for the Text.
voice of those stout great word is which Apoc. 17. 16. and. 20.
the horn spoke / and I looked so long till the beast was taken away and his
body slain and the beast casten into the fire. But the ^ other beastis yet
left deposed their power / and to them was there granted longer to live unto
their prefixed time.

Hitherto have we treated the descripcion of the judgment into the consolacion
3. documents.
of the church militant. Now shall ye learn. iii. things in the declaracion
of this prophecye. First he teaches us not to be offended / nor in our
trouble to cast away all hope / seeing these anticrystis the pope with his
coniured horns / and the Turk with his Mahumete thus to prospere in their
mischief. Secondly he therefore threateneth death and destruction to all these
anticrysten beastis. At last he conforteth the church being yet as a sheep
appointed to the slaughter house with a new descripcion of crystis coming. For
what (think ye) shall be the end of this our troublose tragedy? shall we be
thus ever persecuted? shall these sharp and heuey horns always goore us thus
cruelly? will not god come once down and declare his rightwysenes? will he
never avenge the iniuriouse oppressions and persecucio^s of his just and
chosen church? Aftir our many and greuouse affliccio^s daniel sees a new
and great change. I looked / says he / namely for that arrogant great voice of
so blasphemouse wordis which the horn spoke. I merueled whether god would
leave so great wykednes unpunished and would neglect the glory of his name. He
would not so long suffer it in Sennacherib / he punisshed it anon in Pharao /
he was ano^ even within Goliath and with all his blasphemers in times past. And
shall he now suffer thus long his chosen derely beloved to be thus cruelly for
his sake brent and slain and his gloriouse name thus so spightfully
blasphemed? Daniel looked upon ye long pacient suffering of God / not once
turninge his eyes from him until he saw his judgment at hand / and the
judgment seatis set down. We may not therefore behold the only tribulacions of
the just which may sone thrust us into desperacion: but we must set the
justice of god before our eyes / and wayt for the appointed happy help in time
of tribulacion, promised us and the great rewardis prepared for all that
justly fight in his cause. Daniel merueled to what end the false doctrine and
proud wordis of anticryst would come and where at last he should abide. He saw
that in the last end of ye world these Anticrystis should have in their
affayers great prosperouse success the emperors and kings to bring home
gloriouse and happy victories: the pope to gather home great riches noble
victores high and solemn tytles, and his doctrine and laws to be fered
greatly and received over all crystendom / emperors and kings mightily to
assist and defend them. He saw the Turkis dominion to sprede mightily and his
doctrine to take place, wide and every where. With these prosperouse successes
/ many men / what for weakness / what for hypocrisye / what for fere and the
anguisshe of their persecucions, be auerted from the gospel of peace unto
these anticrysten actis / articles false doctrine / popish rytes /
supersticious ceremonies and unto their deuyllish tradicions and many unto
Mahumets mischief. Wherefore he premonissheth us to be consiant / and to hold
fast in mind the last judgment / that is / the glory of the godly to come and
the pains eternal of the ungodly / so resting upon godis word in our
fervent prayers that for the gretenes of the everlasting ioyeand felicite / we
may nothing fere ne regard the infinite troubles of all our life. Hitherto
looked Paul when he said: I think not the Romans 8.
sufferings of this life to be wortheily co^ 2. Cor. 4
pared to the glory to come which shall be reveled in us. Now will we speak of
the co^minacions cast upon these beastis.

Where Daniel says / I looked until I saw the beast slain and his body
smyten down dead and casten into the fire / and the power of the other beastis
there left / taken away / he threateneth not only to this last beast the
empire of Rome with his spiritual Pope his hole body and all their. x.
helpinge horns against the lord and his anointed, everlasting death and
destruction / but he also in these wordis threteneth the same miserable end
unto ye Turkish or Saracenik kingdom / for the lamb shall have the victory as
it is written in the Apoca. 17. and. 19. chap And I saw the beast and the kings
of ye earth and their hoostes gathered together to make war with the king of
kings and with his host / but the beast with his false prophets were taken
etc. where Joan expowneth ye body of the beast to be his holy cardinals
bisshops / doctors / prethers / his cananized saints and miracle makers to
deceive the people / and all the smered preistis having the beastis mark which
have worshipped the image of this beast. Also in the. xx. chap. The devil is
casten into a ponde of fire and brims^on where the beast and her false prophet^
shall be tormented day and night for ever This beast so perissheth that there
follows nomo / aftir him. But the rest which have their powrs taken from them
/ or depose them / shall yet live with their posterite folowinge them for a
little time not so suddenly to fall as their head horns. For the last of all is
this fowrth in the which aryseth this little horn with his impes and in which
the Turk also persecuteth until himself with Mahumet and their hole
anticristen body be slain. In the other kingdoms yet left, aftir ye Turkis
and popis be in destroyinge / allthough the kings daily perish and lose their
dominions / yet shall their subjects obtain favor with their ouercomers and
live their appointed years / but when the judge shall sittdowne / both the evil
kings with their evil subiectis shall be casten into the pit of fire. Wherefore
ye angel e^powneth it sainge: And they shall take away his power, scater,
and desiroye it in the end prefixed of God. And this is the portion of the
cup of the ungodly which had leyfer follow antichrist then christ. For God
shall / as says Paul / take away all princelynes, power, and might. Wherefore
this comminacion of god prophecieth unto all the kings and people from the
beginnig of the world fighting agyenst the gospel of the almighty God and of
our sauiuor Jesus / everlasting fire unless they repent as the. 2. psalm
warns them.

Also (lest any man should think the little pore lost sheep of christ, even the
church of god to be utterly and for ever devoured of these bereslyons /
leopardes and even of the terrible beast the Turk) Daniel says that the time
and hour is prefixed unto every one of them all. That is to say: It is
decreed in heaven how long every one of the kingdoms in earth shall stand and
how wide they shall sprede. Hitherto seems it Paul to have loken when he said.
God made out of one blood Act. 17.
all man kind to dwell over the universal earth and has prefined their
constituted times and has prefixed the lymites of their habitacion that they
should seek God. Now is it showed how long the lion shall rore / how long the
leoparde shall cry with open mouth / and the bear how long he shall groan and
cry. There yet remains the end of these terrible beastis the pope and the
Turk even the kingdoms which yet stand over Germanye over Turkey and over
Crystendom / to be destroyed by the last day of judgment. Which thing albeit /
it be written of daniel into the consolacion of the catholyk church / yet may
we weep and wayle to see the gospel thus trodden under fete in all the
universal world. Tell me where the gospel shyneth in any part of Aphrica?
where in ye great part of Asia? In Europa / under the Turkis emperors / and
popis emperys there be here and there chirches / but they be so cruelly
oppressed that nether good letters nor lerning may florissh nor ye chirches
may have any godly teachers. But what profits it to complain? Sewerly this
mystery of the cross was setforth in the sone of God anon fro the beginning
of the world and is yet so confirmed with the examples of all Genesis 3. and. 4.
holy men that no consolacion may be given to the church besides the coming
of Jesus christ the sone of God and man. Wherefore (because the power of the Turk
cannot be like the Roman empire nether shall he occupye all Europe (for daniel
denies any fyfte Monarchye to come) we shall briefly express the wordis of
daniel touching the cominge of the sone of god for our consolacion. Christ
therefore shall come like the sone of man / for because he shall judge almen he
shall be se Christ shall come like the sone of man. Joan. 5.
ne as a man of almen. This confirms he saying. The father has given power to
judge unto his son / because he is the sone of man. And therefore it folowth in
the text.

And behold / for in the night I Text.
saw in the cloudis of heaven one coming Christ's kingdom. Joan. 5.
like the son of man / which coming forth, was brought unto the great aged
and he gave unto him power glory and the kingdom / that all people / nations and
tongues should serve and worshipe him / whose power is an everlasting power /
never to be abolesshed / for his kingdom shall never be destroid. 1. Cor. 15


The sone of man to come to this great aged one / is the same that Paul says
christ to delyuervp his kingdom / that is / the church of his chosen unto his
father which gives to christ power glory and a perpetual kingdom ever to
reign with his elect as the Psalms of David declare him and his kingdom.
Also the same that christ says Joan. 5. And his father gave him power to judge
because he is the sone of man. And to be brief christ shall verily thus come
shortly to judge the persewers of his church and to deliver ye godly as himself
describes it Mat. 25. let us therefore proceed.

At this vision / I daniel trembled Text.
in all my body and my mind went fro me for fear / insomiche that I went to
one of ye standers by, asking him the very trowth in all this matter. Which
told it all unto me / and expowned to me the hole vision saying. These 4
beastis figure 4 kings to a rise up or out of the earth. And the hi ghe holy
faithful shall receive the kingdom and obtain it for ever. Aftir this I
desyered to know the certainty of ye fowrth b^as^e which so greatly differed
from all the other / namely in that he was so fereful / armed with t^the with
his claws of st^^l deuouering and tearing into pieces, and the rest he trod
down with his feet. I desyered also to know what me^t the 10 horns in his
head / and to be certified of that little horn growing up under them / and of
the 3 horns smiten out from the former horns. And of the horn that had
menis eyes and spoke so great and s^owte thingis / and why his form and look
apexed s^owter then the other. And that I saw this horn to make bataill with
ye holy faithful and triumphed and prevailed over the^ until the old aged
came / and the judgment was given to the high holy faithful and the time
perfixed was come that the faitfull should obtain and receive their kingdom.
And then he told mo thus. The fowrth beast fignifieth the fowrth kingdom that
shall be in ye world which shall differe from all the other kingdo^s in might
and power for that it shall de^ower the hole earth and break it all to powlder.
The 10 horns signifye 10 kings to arise out and to spring up out of this
beast / and after them there shall arise a'nother little one distinct and
mightier then the former. For he shall oppress and castedowne 3 kings. For he
shall speak at the side of the most highest god or speak on his part of divine
things. But the high holy saitis he shall tangle snarle or destroy. And shall
arrogantly take upon him to change times and laws which shall be put in to his
handis whether it be for a long or any short time. Then aftir shall be the
judgment / and his power thus taken from him / he shall be utterly slain and
destroid. But the kingdom power and ample majesty under the hole heaven shall be
given to the holy faithful people of the most higheste, whose reign is
eternal and all the high powrs shall serve and obey him. And here he ended
his wordis. But I daniel had many a great and troublous thought / so vehemently
was I troubled that my chere and my favor was clean changed. But yet reserved
I this thing in my heart.

Now have ye the exposicion of all this vision as it is before expowned and now
declared by the aungel which was christ himself / wherefore it needs not to
tarry miche upon this place save only to declare the confession of our faith
therein and to confirm the angels exposicion by ye other places of the
scripture. For in that daniel at this vision was so troubled / asked one of the
by standers / and so fast reserved the angels words: we ought to learn this
doctrine of the vision of these 6. kingdoms / that is to say of the 4
Monarchies / of the anticristen kingdom / and of the kingdom of christ / to be
reverenced and received as the word of god and the trwe understanding thereof
to be asked of christ ye messager of god / and not for the crueltye of these
beasts and horns yet persecuting the church to fall or once swerve from the
kingdom of christ which is the gospel but to contempne all the miseries
injuries and troubles of this life yea and even death it self for crystis
kingdo^s sake. Of crystis judgment to come Joan also says Apoc. 4. and. 20
he saw a seat set and 24 cheyers for the 24 eldres etc. For albeit christ be
the only judge wc of his father has received all judgment / yet shall the
apostles asiste him having their trones. And therefore says he here. And the
judgment was given to the high holy faithful. Christ is called the old aged
/ for a judge ought to be a grave sage man of long experience. Whom Joan called
the lamb slain from the beginning of the world / and the word Ion. 1.
which in the beginning was with god: so that we may see that the prophetis
aknowleged christ ever both god and man his whight vesture shows him to be ye
most just and incorrupt judge without spotte / and himself in a gloriouse
victory over syne death deuel and hell to be seen ioyouse and counfortable to
his faithful To confirm his old aunciet sage grauite he saw his hears pure
as fine whight woll / hoar headed pretend grauite and wisdom. His flammey
seat casting forth long strykes of fire signifye that god is a terrible
consuminge fire to the ungodly. For Joan saw him with a two edged sword
procedinge out of his mouth / for that his sentence which he shall there
pronounce shall be sharper and depelyer persinge through / then any two edged
sword in separating Hebr. 4.
the stinking gotis from the pure innocent lambs. Here Daniel sees the same
sword like a fyery floude flowinge out of Crys^is mouth whose vehement
mighty heuey sentence over the ungodly / no horn may resist. Then comes he
forth in his high majesty accompanied with his infinite noumber of angels so
that non of these horns be able to resist him / but the wyked shall tremble
and quake desyeringe the mountans to fall over them to hyde them from his fight
/ for hereof is he called the God zabaoth that is the god of hoo^tes. The bokis
to be laid Romans 2.
open / are the consciences of every man accusing or excusinge them. For they
shall have their factis in mind freshly / openly seen / wherefore they be
worthily condemned. 1. Cor. 4.
For that great day shall make opene the secretis of every heart. For when it
shall be seen who be set on ye right hand and who on the fyfte / then shall all
frauds / hypocr^cye / tyranny which yet be taken for rightwysnes / godlynes
and zele / be laid open / then shall Anticrystes blasphemies and persecucions
be iuged and punisshed as ye see in the text: when christ stood before Caiphas
to be condemned / he Mat. 26

tale to deffe men / for it was as miche to say to them / as this. Now I stand
before you as a man mortal to be iuged / but here aftir ye shall not so see me
standing / but coming upon ye cloudis of heaven / so that ye be now warned

where he says: That the judgment shall be given to the holy high saintis and ye

cast into the lake or pit of fire? now then shall Christ no more be persecuted
in his members / wherefore he shall then be full glorified. And we shall have
our bodies in joy which once were partakers of our persecucions / wherefore
we shall then have our perfyt and full felicite / which yet in the mean time
we have only in our sowlis.

But what means the angel to say: He shall s^arle or destroy ye high
sayntis? verily else but that with his false doctrine capciouse oaths articles /
and interrogacions he shall fraudelently deceive and trappe the simple
innocents and shed their blood tyrannously. Also he shall arrogantly take upon
him and think to change the state of times and laws. He weneth to change ye
time which with sword and fire thinks to shorten the life of man and to
prevent and disapoint gods infallible eternal and immutable providence whereby
he has prefiyed every manis time and hour of death which as noman can differ
or prolong it / so ca^ne noman shorten nor prevent it / except men will make
God an ignorant person and so consequently no god at all. He cha^geth the
times and laws that any of the six work days commanded of god will make
them unholy and idle days when he list / or of their own holy days
abolisshed / make Exo. 23. 20. and. 31. 34. and. 35. Leuit. 23 Deuteronomy. 5.
work days again / and when they changed ye Saturday into Sunday / of eting
days fasting days / of merry and glad days to marye in / they can make
sorrowful days forbiddinge maryages. They have changed gods laws and turned
them into their own traditions to be kept above Gods preceptis. And as for
their own laws they will change and break them when they list. And this power
shall anticrist have whether it be for long or short time. For so miche sowneth
the Hebrew phrase / which is for a time / a little while / and half a time /
signifyinge that Anticryst shall make laws to stand as long and as short
time as he lists and the times will he order / set and change at his own
plesur. But is it not only ye office of god to chang times and laws? Here is
therefore the prophecye fulfilled of him. Even to exalt himself above all thing
that god is called. This text. But the high saints he shall tangle trappe and
destroy and arrogantly think to change the times and laws etc. is of diverse
learned men diuersely translated. The vulgar text says: That he shall speak
wordis against the high god. And destroy the sayntis of the mosthyghest and
think that he may change times and laws and they shall be taken into his hand
for a time and half a time. Joan Oecolampadius translateth it thus / He shall
speak wordis on the side of the most highest etc. and the Tygurine bible or
zir^k text has. And he shall make wordis of divine things. Derba enim faciet
de rebus diuinis / that is / for he shall make wordis of divine things. The
scole doctors of diuynite as D^nce and his faryne* what new strange sterting
terms they have inverted to express their dirty diuynite / the scole men know

In this vision / daniel sees him to have a mouth given him / spekinge great
and stowt things. To speak against the high God / or to speak on his side or on
his behalf for his worsship as though he were sent and commanded of God is when
he speaks of himself stark lies and blasphemies. Is it not against god thus
to speak and to make us believe that he speaks on the part of the most highest
/ when he speaks for the devil is part and all on his side? The serpent made
Eve believe that he spoke on Gods side / when he told her that her eyes should
be opened and them to be as goddis / etc. The papists would make us believe that
in all their laws, false worshipes / fulser inuocacions, decent service /
laudable rytes and ceremonies / in all their necessary enstruccio^s and
vncrysten institucions / sermons / sacraments / blessingis / buzings halowingis
/ * ^sses and siche like / that they speak all for goddis worship and on his
part / when all is plain against god and his word and for their own fylthey
lucre / honor / and sinful affectis. Thus make they wordis or false matter of
divine thingis / that is to say / they mok with goddis holy word or thruste
in their own dreams for goddis word into the great hurt and slaying of his
holy faithful / and they think to change times and laws: Which all these three
things shall be putt into his power (says the angel) for a time times and
half a time / or as has the Hebrew for a time long or short. How long ye
church shall suffer under these horns till christ come to judgment, the day
and hour of their fall, and his cominge, God only knows it. But the holy
faithful which have been these many years past / and yet be delivered into
their handis to suffer / (ah less) they think it to long that anticryst shall
thus reign / and persecute the church unto the last day. But when the
pestelent popes and the cruel Turk promise themselves the Monarchye of the
hole world / then shall there be a soden fall of their wyked purpose / as it
is expowned before / for then shall that most desired joyful day of christ
begin to shine over us / in which day yt church shall be saved and these
three beastis / the Pope with his clergy / the Turk and Mahumete / with their.
x. horns persecutinge the gospel / shall be for ever dampened.

Oh God immortal / how great vastacions and destruccions in the church are
there prophesied of Ezechiel to be made God and Magog
of Gog and Magog? And here how cruel persecucions does daniel prophecy to be
done of the Turk and pope even the two handis and horns of the devil? pray
we therefore the merciful god / the father of our savior Jesus / as did king
Ezechias that he would give us peace and his word in our days / and would
suffer shortly to come our delyuerer Jesus / lest we be putt into the hand of
this enimye / of all enimyes the most cruellest that now are / have been / and
ever shall be. So be it. For beter is it the last day to come / then the Turk.

Philip Melanchton both lernedly and Philip. Melan. The doctrine
sharply notes upon this chapter. iii. things to be contained. A doctrine / a
comminacion / and a consolacion. The doctrine (he says) pertains chiefly
unto this last age of the world. For men be meruelously moved at the slyber
fortunes thereof / unto both the parties. Some seeing the great prosperouse
success fortunes and marvelous victories of the Turkis and other menis
kingdoms / and contrary wise the chirches of God to have so hard fortunes /
persecuted and destroyed in every region / will rather follow them that best
prosper / and so fall from ye true church to the Turk or Pope yet reigning
in seculare princes polycies / doctrynes and institucio^s / actis and articles
/ enbracing their false and ungodly religion. Yea they miss ayed the Turk and
Pope fightinge on their sydis to bring them into an amplier and higher empire
/ to thente^t they might be either partakers of their prosperouse success and
lucre / or else to have yt Turk their helpinge horn to suppress the gospel /
for unto this end shall the pope help the Turk / and the cardinals and
bisshops help and persuade their emperor and princes. Although themselves /
as they wilnot receive the Turkis wyked doctrine / so in their hertis will they
never be obedient and subject to their seculare lawful headis and magistrates.
But when they shall find an occasion / utterly rebel and fight against their
headis. For this cause god warns us before / lest we taken with the
admiracion of power and good success / or else broken with trouble and persecucion
fall from the gospel unto these prosperosly puffed up princes and prelatis
consentinge to their false doctrine and wyked enstruccions.

The signs here described are the manifest markis of an ungodly king and
kingdom. Tokens of a wyked king and kingdom
One is to teach and suffer to be taught any doctrine contumelious iniuriose
^lasphemose against god. Another is to kill the faithful good prechers and
professors of gods word and to take away the scriptures, the fode of their
souls, from the simple poor thirstinge for the word of their salvation. Unto
these tokens god adds this testimonye and threteninge. That he will dampne
this beast / be he Turk / emprour / prince or Pope / or all The co^minacio^
together and translate their wyked kingdoms into strange gouerners. Also here
is to be noted a another heuey thretening which precheth the calamitouse
affliccions of ye church. He says these horns shall move and make bataill
against the godly and destroy many Crystians and their congregacions. Which is
an heuey sermon and contrary to manis judgment thus reasoning. Wherefore should
god give so prosperous impery and victories to so open wyked men and to people
so contumeliose and contrary to christ / openly blaspheming the scriptures and
slayinge the true prechers? wherefore suffers he us calling upon him only
and our only mediator Christ / holdinge his doctrine / thus cruelly to be
cast away and oppressed? Trewly daniel here speaks of a great greuouse
calamite and long persecucion. For in all Aphrica and in a great part of Asia
/ many years has the name of christ been quenched. In Europa / albeit here and
there in the Turkis empire there be left yet some christian congregacions / yet
are they with so cruel heuey fierce bondag oppressed that no good studies of
christian letters may there be excercysed / freely learned and professed / the
chirches being without true techers / and there many by little and little have
casten away ye name and religion of criste. As ye see this day among us many
to fall bak to the Pope and to his popish doctrine because ye seclare policye
so strongly and cruelly yet defends it. The turk The corrupcion of the youth.
plucketh from the parents of cristians a certain noumber of their children to
enstruct them in bataill and to nosell them in his Mahumetis tradicions / rytes
and religion / as do some Christian emprours and princes pluke the young learned
from the universities and schools into their courts / which once poisoned with
all courtly corrupcions / anon be they made bisshops cardinals / pastores and
rychely beneficed. Which miserable seruitute in court is harder to a christian
curate then the bondag in the * furnace of Egypt. And yet are there many so
mad that with greatsiewte and labors thrust themselves for luker and honor
into this miserable derke Egypt. But what are the causes of these calamities
aftir manis reason? verily it is thought by manis judgment / The corrupcion of
manis judgment.
the trwe church to be the synagoge of satan / and them to be heretics which
cleue to gods word / or else why should god thus suffer them (think they) to be
oppressed and brent if he loved them? And thus manis reason douteth whether they
be redeemed with Crystis blood which suffer pacienly for his word.

But here must we behold the face of the very church even from ye beginning
The form and face of the trw chir che.
where our first parents saw the testimony given out of heaven in the
sacrifice of Abel whereby they had hope the church to be continued and brought
forth into Abels posterite. But lo / anon was Abel slain of his own brother /
and wyked Cain a lone was left / whose ungodly posterite bylt a cite and played
the tyraunts whylis yet his first parents lived and co^ tempned of Cain their
own sone. Again / aftir Nohes flode (Babylon once buylt) the heithen (the
doctrine of Nohe and Sem contempned) fill from god. And but a very little flok
of godly men was there left / which sely flok wandered carefully hither and
thither poorly bysted / even the family of Abraham. And sone aftir / the same
psalm. 104
sely sort of Abraham's families posterite were tossed into Egypt there
oppressed with heuye seruitu^e in myer and ^ley groaning under their intolerable
burde^s / Exo. 1.
which aftirwarde comen into Palestine there to dwell in the land of Canaan /
what slaughters suffered they? How great mutacions and destruccio^s of their
realm followed them? what hard captiuities vexacions and affliccions endured
and sustained they? And how little a part of the world was Israel and the
Israelites? whylis yet in the mean c^asen / the gentilis which knew not god
obtained the most high empyres of the world. When we see therefore siche often
poor troublos states and faces of the church / The face of our present
church.
let us aknowleg the wrath of god against the world / and not fall from god /
although in this last time we see the true church greuousely shaken and
afflicted / but let us keep fast in mind this plain descripcion and ferfull
face of the church. That is by the meruclous counsel and will of god / the
church to be laid under ye cross. The causes whereof be showed in the doctrine
of the prophets and apostles. Only this thing let us consider concerning this
fast old age of the world. That the Prophets and Apostles prophesied / the
world to be plaged / because that aftir the gospel be publesshed and preched
in certain regions / the tyrannous horned kings and papistis should wex wode
and tame their fierce furye upon the sely weak members of christ. And besidis
this / for that even of them / which should defend and nourish chirches / the
pore congregacio^s should be persecuted seduced and polluted with images / false
doctrine / cruel slaughter of saintis and with almaner prodigious lechery and
lustis / we must know that of these seadis / stories do show ye Mahu meti
poison and the popish pestelente religion to have had their beginings.

When Arabia and Egypt and the Rome church were (...) and torn into many
monstrose doctrines and sectis / then the confusion of sundry opinions and of
supersticious semely ceremonies and rites did move light men to cleue to / and
follow their false doctrine cloked and colored with hypocricye and apparent
chosen holiness. And therefore daniel lykeneth both Mahumete and the pope unto
that horn which has manis eyes / that is a fayer decent semely show of
vtwarde devotion (as they sey) of laudable rites and gods holy service. Aftir
this / as the turkis power increased / so did the popis auctorite and false
doctrine take place and sprede over all crystendom / so that as the world was
and is corrupt with their false religion / so is it / and shall be grievously
plaged with the same two forked horns for their idolatrye / for their
worshipping of ded saintis / and for the profaning and filthefying of the holy
souper of the lord and for their stinking wyue les chastity. But see now how
the times agree. It was decreed of the transubstancion (as Whefor
Tra^substa^cion and othoma^ began to gither.
they call it) in the year of christ 1215. Nocentius the third being pope.
Which decree has confirmed the most horrible prodigiose idolatrye that ever
was. And ano^ aftir in the year 1250 begane Othoma^s kingdom to prospere. And
so shortly aftir this idolatry once confirmed / his kingdom begane to arise
and increased above all other regions and brought forth weapens against the west
part of the world to punisshe the filthei spottis of the romish church. So
that as soon as this idolatry of the (...) begane to be confirmed of the pope /
the turks power did increase to skourg it in cristendom / and shall yet more and
more grow and preasse upon us till this idolatry of the (...) be taken quite
away. This othoman being the great turk enlarged miche the turkis dominion /
out of whose blood all the kings of the turks sense unto this day have reigned
and taken their original / to whom god gives strength and power to punissh all
cristendome for their idolatrye in the (...) / for their false inuocacion / and
other abominacions which require a another Nebucadnezar / even the turk to
punisshe them.

But yet is there added this consolacion. Where Daniel signifies that there

shall never be the fyft monarchy. And therefore the turkis power shall not be
like the Roman empire to destroy all Europe. For as ye see the popis kingdom
to fall when he thought himself most sewr and highest: even so shall the turks
imperie fail and incline when he shall come to his highest thinking himself to
conquire all and to reign alone for ever / then shall his half time come upon
him with a sode^ fall in the mids of his course. For then shall the most
glad day begine to shine / in which the sone of god shall sterevp ye dead
giving to his church eternal life and glory / and casting all the ungodly
into everlasting torments. These same things be spoken of Gog and Magog in Gog
magog.
Ezechiel and in apoca. 20. For Ezechiel faith that Gog and Magog aftir they

have done their mischief in destroing and slaynge / then shall their selves at
last be desiroid in the mountains of Israel. Which albeit / it may be
vnderstande^ of the last judgment / yet I think it to signify the batails
which the godly have and shall have in this last old age with the popissh
emprowrs kings and turk, wc Where ar ye mountains of israel.
all shall be ouercomen in the hill is of Israel / that is / in the places where
the church of christ dwellethe in which the gospel is preched and received* and
the people trwly in the faith of the son of god one only mediator call upon
their heavenly father. For the pope and turk shall not be overcome but by the
sone of god fighting for his church as ye shall see it cler^yer in daniel 12.
chapt. saying. Michael (which is christ) the great captain shall stond forth
for the defense of the peples childrn. But both in daniel and in Ezechiel
there be prophesied many great destruccions. Which with all our hertis we
beseech god to mitigate (...) Hitherto Philip Mesancthon.

This cap. is a prophecy of the monarchy The. 8. Chapt.
of the Perses to be translated to the grekis and Macedones / Dario their king
slain by Alexander / which dead / anon ye Monarchy of the grekis was divided
in to 4 chief kingdoms that is into Macedone / Egypt / Asiam and Syram. And at
last in the Syrsake kingdom there arose Antiochus epiphanes which being of all
enemies the most cruel tyrant / scourged the jews / and was the figure of our
anticrystes. In all these heuey and blody mu^acions of kingedoms and trowblose
times* God would confort his people, lest in the middis of these affliccions and
offendicles they should despeyer. Let us hear ye text.

In the third year of ye reign of king Text.
Beltsazar there was showed a vision unto me Daniel / aftir this former vision
wc in my vision loking about me / methought I was by the floude Eule.

about the castle At the flowde wherefore visions be seen.
or t^wer of Susis, write the pliny in his 6 book 27. chap. Daniel saw this
vision by the flowd whose waters like as the later waves thruste forth the
former sourges / even so shall one tribulacion and persecucion succeed a another
continually as long as crystes church dureth and the gospel be trwly and freely
preched unto crysis coming. Wherefore it is necessary the church to be
counforted and taught lest among these greuose affliccions and heuey
persecucions she fainte and despayer. Also it behooves us to be warned that we
might know the causes of these plages and so to estiem them. And therefore says
daniel here / that for the sins of the people / was Antiochus sent so cruelly
to punisshe 2. these. 2.
them as says Paul. Because men loved not the trwthe now preched to the^ /
therefore shall god send them mighty illusions making them to believe lies.
These heuey threatis should move us diligently to receive and conserve the true
doctrine now offered us, lest god suffer yet a greater d^rkenes and greuoser
plages to be casten upon us. It shall be therefore expedient to behold the
horrible destuccions and cruel affliccions done unto the jews by Antichus, that
we might have consolacion / lest we fall and despeier seeing there be many like
Antiochus now executing like tyranny and cruelty over chirstis floke.

And mine eyes lysted up / lo I saw Text.
a ^amme having two horns standing before the floude which horns being very
long / yet was there one higher and longer then the the other / and in the
extremest part it did shote forth most prowdly. This ra^me I saw running with
his horns against the weste / and against the north and against the sowthe so
that no beasts might resist him / nor be delivered from out of his power: so
that he did what he listed and wexed great in doing great acts. And whilis I
considered (lo I saw an he got coming fro the west upon the face of al ye
earth / nether lyted he upon the earth. And this got had a forth stretched
horn to be seen standing betwixt his eyes* He came unto the horned ram whom I
saw standind before the flowd and with a mighty violence he ran against him.
And I saw him come eue^ to the ram / where in his hot fury he smitte the ram
/ and broke both his horns, for the ram had no strength to withstand him so
that he smitte him down to the grownde and trod him under his fete / and
there was non that might desyuer the ram from him. Then did the got right
valiant great acts and was mightily and highly magnified / and when he was in
his most strength and power / his great horn was broken / in whose place there
grew forth 4 horns procedinge against the four parts of the world. And out
of one of them there went forth a little horn which wexing great did proud and
cruelactis against the sowth and by east even in the most amene and pleasant
land. And then he stretched forth himself against the beutiful host and
company of heaven / and of this celestial company and also of the starris he
threw down some of them to the earth and trod them under his feet. yea and at
last / even against the self emperowr of the host with great arrogancye he
lyfted up himself with crakis and bostes so that thereby the daily perpetual
sacrifice was taken away / and the seat of the sanctuary of god was subverted.
And the heavenly host with their daily perpetual sacrifices were given up into
his hand is for their synne^ / and he scourged down the truth to the ground
and committed this cruel mischief prosperously.

When the Babylony* kingdom was now at an end / and daniel had sen^ the
Perses to have the empire / this vision was showed him / to thentent he should
teache his church how that both under the Medis and Perses the conquirers of
Babylon / and also under Ale^ander the conquirer of the Persies / and at last
under Antiochus that Anticryst and s^ourge of the Jews / should be persecuted
and plaged. For trewely because the people eue^ loves more the peace and ^ase
of the world then to study to live aftir goddis preceptis, the spring of all
peace / therefore is this cross showed them to be suffered and carried under
these kingdoms then to come for breking of gods commandments / that god
according to his threateningis might be feared / and Christ according to his
promises might be waited fore / and hi^ coming prayed for to god. This vision is
a prophecy of the vprysinge and fall of the kingdo^s of Cyrus / Alexander /
and Antiochus the very pesielence of the Jews.

The Ram standing at the Persi^ ^loude signifies Cyrus the duke and
leaderforth Of the ^am wc was the Persie king.
of the Persies. He is called the two horned / because he ledforth the hosts
of both the Medis and Persies. For his. ii. horns signifye these two hosts.
This Rammis greatest high horn signifies Cyrus ye king of Persie / the hayer
at last of all Mede / yea and made the king of all the kingdom. This Ram to
run with his horns against the west / north and sowth signifies him comen
from the ^ast out of Persie to have faughten ayenste all men / that is to weyt

figure to any of our present christian realms / let the diligent obseruers of

of the Got / that is of Alexander king of the Grekis.

Here the Got / as before the Leoparde signifye the same king / even great

Alexander: But as ye Leopardes or spotted pantheres / albeit they hunteoute all
beastis and fear no darte nor spear (for they smite them of with their
swiftnes) yet with wine are they made dronken / and then aftir their lusts one
leapinge the other made weary, are they taken. Even so the kings Philip and
Alexander ouercoming all and nothing fearing / they were so ouercomen of wine
and lechery that the one was destroyed of voluptuosnes / and dronkenes killed
the the other. The leopardes be desyerouse of wine / and therefore there hunters

down ye hole great vessel full of mine / the savor whereof drawth the
panthers or leopards (for both be one save the pardus is the male and the
panther the female) out of their dens / which when they have all dronken
out and be made dronken / they play their lustis together / so that at last
they made weary, fall down to sleap. And then come the armed honters and take
them. Even so have there been many valiant / prudent princes / but in conclusion
by lustis / intemperance and dro^kenes they perisshed destroyed wretchedly. As
were Philip and Alexander / and aftir them Demetriu^ and the later Philip /

Also let us see the descripcion of the The descripcio^ of Greece
land / for that this Got came from the west upon the face of all the earth
and atteyned or lyted not upon the earth. Which signifies Ale vander coming
forth from Greece to invade estewarde and then sowthwarde and at ^ast northwarde
in short space subdewed all the world unto him. To not towche nor lyte upon the
earth it is said / because he beginning in his.xx. year / did in a manner fly

year of his age / wherein he dyed not for age nor in victory but with
voluptuosnes and wine was he oppressed. Wherefore that prominent great horn of
the Got in his most s^rength broken of / signifies the mighty power of great
Alexander smyten down in his chief flowers. Whether there be yet any siche
Gotis / let their fortune declare them / and the clear eyed observe it. But
whom did he so smite with his horne^ verily even ye ram before the floude. For
as in floudis one sourge soupeth up and deuoureth a another / An apt similitude.
even so one of these kingdoms de^oured up another / the later swellowd up ye
former. And how the Persik kingdom was translated to the Grekis / and the
Greek empire of Alexander divided into ye Macedonyk / Syriac / Asiatik and
Egypt kingdoms (which all / Daniel by all his words of the Ram and Got will
teache) it is plentuos liar described of Diodoro / Curtio / Iustino. etc. Now to
the little horn sprongen up out of these.iiii. horns / that is to say / of
Antiocho Epiphane. Of ye lyt le horn Antiochus Epiphanes.


The little horn signifies Antiochum Epiphanem descendinge out of the stock of
Seleucus holdinge Syriam aftir the death of Alexander / which aftir this ways
came to the kingdom. Out of Seleuco was borne Antiochus the great / which had
these.iii. sons / Seleucu^ / Antiochum Epiphanem / and Demetrium. And when
Antiochus the great warred with the Romans and had left in hostage or pledge
Antiochum Epiphanem and Demetrium / he dyed in Syria / ^^ left his sone
Seleucum aftir him / no king but a fool / wherefore Epiphanes knowinge of his
fathers death / got himself preuily from Rome and came into his fathers
kingdom / and his unapt brother deud / he enioied the kingdom in the.137. year
aftir Alexanders death / witness the.1. chapter. of the first of the

prophecieth that by Antiochum Epiphanem the sowtheste (even the most pleasant
land of the Jews / should be skourged and plaged / which is called z^by in
Hebrewe for her fertilite / that is the beutye and flowr of all landis even as

of this blodye beast. But right heuey destines abide them that evil deserve /
which thing I may confirm by the example of Antiochus the very image of
Anticryst. For when he invaded and destroyde in the east parties (as daniel
here prophecieth) and not only from the besege of Elymaid of Persie / he was
with the great heuines of his mind repelled and put bak / but also when it was
told him his capitayn Lysiane with his host to have (...) fled / he fill
into so great a sykenes and thought / that before his death 1 match. 6
he confessed himself therefore so grievously to be plaged and so compelled to
dye / because he had so spoiled and destroyed y4 temple of Jerusalem and so
cruelly skourged the Jews. For it was not enoughe for him thus to persecute
the Jews and subuerte all their laws / holy rytes and godly ceremonies and
sacrifices instituted of God / but he would arrogantly blaspheme god himself /
suppress his truth with all his divine sacred ordinances. yea and he
prospered in his mischief. This miche be said for the preface of the prophecye.
Now hear the interpreter.

And I heard an holy one speak Text.
saying unto a certain meruelouse excellent one. How long shall this vision of
the daily perpetual sacrifice and of the blasphemose sin which is the cause
of this deuas^acion and destruction endure / that both the holy sacred temple
with all her sacrifices and the Jews shall be thus trodden down? And he answered
me. Aftir two thousand and. 300. days which Which is 6. years* 3. month and
20 days
contain the day and night / shall the holy temple be restored to the just
and lawful use. And whylis I daniel beheld the vision desyerouse to know it /
lo there srode before me one like a man. And I heard with in the floude eule
the voice of a man crying out saying: Gabriel / teach this man this vision.
Then he came nye^ the place where I stood / whose coming so nyghe me / made me
so afraid / that I fyldowne flat one my face. And he said unto me: Attend and
perceive thou sone of man. For this vision shall be fulfilled in the last time
(or in the end of the captivity.) And whylis Gabriel thus spoke with me I
fylldowne grouelinge as one had been ouercomen with great sleap. And he
towching me / lifted me up again into my standing. And then he said: Behold / I
shall teach the what thing shall come when wrath is ye captivity of Babylon
and of antiochus
this wrath is finisshed / for it shall have an end at the time prefixed.

Daniel calls the interpretor of the vision / a meruelouse excellent one. As
I^ say calls christ a marvelous one / a counselor / etc. I say. 9. Gabriel yt
strength of god.
Here therefore he asks this meruelouse one which was christ apperinge like
the angel Gabriel (so called for his meruelouse excellent strength) how long
ye people of god should be so skourged and persecuted of Antiochus / which was
the figure of our Anticrysten Antioches and little horn crept up in the Roman
imperye / and so consequently what affliccio^s hang over the chirches of christ
to the worlds end / for it is manifest that whatsoever the aungel told before
of the heuey affliccions of the Jews / the same be now verified and done upon
the church of the gentyles / which things since they be past / it is no dowt /

Now is the vision declared to Daniel by the aungel / at the commandment of
the son of god. But certainly it is said and prophesied of owr present
anticrists both spiritual and seculare playing antioches part even this
day. For that anticriste Antiochus over the jews prefigured owr anticrystes
in the end of the world over the gentiles. The occasion of the destruction of

of their emperowrs and princes. For as before crystes first cominge / for the

says: when sin and wikednes is prevailed and has the ouerhand / what else

constituted by fraud and supersticion. Antiochus compared with Anticryste:
by Draconites.
Daniel gods painter would by the descripcion Antishameles face.
of Antioche / prefigure unto us the manners of Anticryste. First of his
vnshamefaced face for that he was and is the most impudent despyser of god and
the fiercest bold beast to persecute and to be contrary to his word as be
the two sons of antioche this day / the turk and the Rome bishop with his
horns / ye most shameless pestelent persecutors and condempners of the gospel
of god / for arrogantly dare they do what they list contrary to gods will. Of
his fraud is he described. for as that subtle fraudelent fox Antiochus his
frauds.
craftily circumuented egipte and Iudeam / even so be the false turk and his
subtyle serpent the pope the two crafty merchants with their false feigned
wordis and deuillish doctrine to peruerte al me^ not of their own power / but
of other menis. For Antiochus was so mighty over of other menis power.
Iud^am / by the falshed and unfaithfulness of the bisshops of the jews and by
ye vain leuite of the people as it is read in the Maccabeis. And even so these
two brethren (albeit unlike inprofession) the turk and the pope / got and
constituted their kingdoms by other men is power and might. The turk at first
by the mighty frauds of mahumete, and the pope by the power of emperowrs
bisshops cardinals kings and his own subtyle supersticiouse hypocrysye and
chosen holiness.

And now therefore shall ye note that by the counsel and mischief of the
bishops Anticristis seat shall be translated and tossed from the ecclesiasti^
cheier of Rome unto the secular emperowrs and king is trones as the storye
fygured in that secular and anticriste Antiochus / which was out of the stoke
of the emperowr of the grekis called Seleucus and held the kingdom of Sire And
begune to reign in the 137. year aftir the death of Alexander / as witnesses
the first book of the Maccabe. This has ever ben seen in all stories. That
the emperowrs and kings will attemper bend and bow all religions and
beleifes unto their own profit and pleasures. As when Antiochus knew the
jews for their religion and faith not gladly to suffere any heithen king to be
their gouerner / he first studied how he might destroy their faith and
subuerte their religion and so to become their king. For he iuged all
religions besides his own to be va^n and false / which being in this proud
temerariouse judgment co^ceiuing of himself to have auctorite to chang menis
faith and gods religion / fill into many carnal lustis, filthiness, ambicion,
and into allkynd of greuose crimes casten up of god to fight boldly against god
himself even to bring Iudeam into bondage and to abolisshe all the old doctrine
of the prophets unto the which his proud purpose, the ungodly wikednes of the
bisshops ministered diligently this occasion. For when the godly man Onias was
bishop of the jews / his brother Jason went to Onias. Jason.
Antiochus in the beginning of his reign and gave him money to destroy his
brother Onias and to give him the bysshoprik. And by a like fraud there came
the third man Menelaus and ^he pluk^ the bisshoprik from Jason / which bishops
brought in the greek profane filthei open plays into the cite of Jerusalem to
do antioche pleasure / they trod under fo^e and contempned gods law and
conformed themselves unto the most filthye courtly profane facions of
Antiochus drowned in all excess, pride, dilicate and soft syuing and in all
the haithen manners. Aftir this / was menelaus slain / whom the bishop Alcimus
succeeded which was also a pestelent ennimie to the Maccabeis. These obominable
crimes of the bishops were the seadis of all the miseries and calalamitis of
that time / as they be now.

Now return we to the comparison of antiochus anticrist described of his
va^^acion.
with Anticrist describing him of his incredible destruction. Which how he
destroid the people of god / as we cannot read it without great dolor written
in the Maccabeis / even so not without weping tears do all cryste^ men now
feel it how the cursed turk abolissheth the divine scriptures / and the
Romish bishop (the lord god renyed which has bought us) brings in his
dampnable fectis as peter antiochus was fortunate. 2 Macca be. 5.
witnesses. Now see what good success and fortune he had in his mischief:
which prosperity therein god gave him to sko^r^e the people for their sins. And
out of the same spring and well it is clear that the prosperouse success of
the turk and of the pope flows / as Paul witnesses / affirming god to give
them effectuouse errors and strong illusions to believe lies. He is also
described of his oppression antiochus ye oppressor of great and good men.
of great men and of the holyme^. But wherefore permits god him so to do^
verily because he hates sin whose grauite we see not / and will mortifye us
^^ the cross: nether was the world at any time worthei to have any holy man
long to dwell in it. Wherefore this serpe^tin sea^ Antiochus must nedis / to his
pain / feel ye mighty faithful of the church / by their faith and prayers to
be stronger then all the emperowrs popes kings devils and deaths. An example
have ye of those 7 brethren with their mother. What merue^^ then is it / if

holy faithful of the church? Se yet the success of antiochus was deceitful
and proud.

wherewith they and their bisshops doctors and false apostles bewitche and
inflame the emperowrs kings and their mighty magistrates of the world to
persecute the congregacio^s of god / they be extolled in themselves and ar
become so great contempners of god and his word as the 10 and 73 psalms
describe them. Also he destroith many with antiochus destroeth with giftis.
his great benefices and promocions. For many men be not only by his
prosperose success deceived supposing it to be divine and perpetual / but
also because they be bownde^ to him by gifts and benefits / they be as it were
fysshes taken with a sweet beyght. For so did Antiochu^ craftily retraine in
office these bishops Jason menelaum Alcimum and siche other with his benefits
and bisshopriks as long as he listed. And do not the pope / yet a greter
friend to the turk then were then the bishops to Antiochus / agreter friend I
say of the turk then of any faithful precher / bind emperowrs and kings the
patrons of his wiked kingdom unto him with large giftis divine titles

To resist the prince of princes / is to be extolled above every thing that is

be so like as one ^g to a another. At last Daniel describes him of his
departing. For the workman is worthei his reward. As before christ is first
coming / Antiochus not touched with manis hand but with the hand of god /
therefore dyed with alto late repentance because he so cruelly destroid the
people of god and their temple / 1 match. 6
even so before cristis second coming / this wiked forlorn child shall be
reveled and with the breath of the lords mouth destroid: that is / the
errors of anticrist the 2. these. 2.
pope and his kings and emperowrs shall be disclosed and reprehended by the
doctrine of the law and gospel / so that all the holy faithful shall abhor
them and fall from them, non to cleave to them but the dampened wretches. Paul
confirming the same / saing. They shall be all condemned which believe not the
truth but delight in unright wysnes. Hitherto have we compared Antiochum with
anticryst. And now albeit the lord in this owr time skourgeth vehemently the
kingdoms of anticryst with the gospel / yet shall not his kingdoms altogether
fall before his lust judgment / as Paul affirms saing. He shall destroy him
with his clear and bright cominge. And in the Apocal. The false prophet
shall be cast into the dououring botomles pit. Whosoever therefore is wise let him
avoid out of babylon / that is let him fall from anticryste. Netherfore fear
let us not forsake the profession of the gospel / for the persecucio^ of the
anticrists. For beter is it for crists sake to dye then with anticrist to lya^
unto the end.



Now return to the descripcio^ of owr anticristen Antioches in the text where
be many particles having very heuye and terrible significacions or tokens to
come over them / which every diligent reader by himself may consider if he
behold our present days.

The truth (says Daniel) shall be the text and 12 verse.
trodden under foot upon the earth.

For now we see the bisshops and their sworn secular sort to defend against
their own consciences the most manifest crimes impieties and all abominacion /
as be their ungodly abuses of sses / plain idolatry / worshipping of dead
seiants / stocks and stones / wyuelesse unchaste chastity whore^om and all
manner prodigiouse lecheries. Wherefore it is plain that they mok and blaspheme
the verite / even christ and his rightwismaking and trede down the trewthe under
their sinful fete. Of these both secular and spiritual anticrists thus says
the text.

There shall stondvp a bold vnshamefaced king even the very blasphemose
arrogant cotempner of god / he shall be subtyle fraudelent understanding how to
satiffye his couetu^se and libidinose lus^es.

This king shall growvp and obtain his wiked plesures / non sui^ viribus /
not by his own power and strength or lerning / but (as did Antiochus rob the
temple) by the fraudis of the bisshops / and by the inconstant leuite of the
people. And above al men's estemacion he shall waast and consume infinite riches
of his own and other menis. He shall abolish the trwe worship of god and bring
in idolatry causing it to be spread over all: he shall nosel his people with
haithen rytis and ceremonies.

And he shall have great success and fortune. He shall slaye many godly men /
and wyn many men with great giftis / rich byshopriks and benefices and fayer
promyses / whom when he has taken with his beastly belly beightis / he shall
retain them in service to augment his profits and to satisfye his lusts and
plesures in increasing his riches dignities titles and his own carnal
affectis.

But atlast without handis shall be Text.
be destroid.

Antiochus was not sla^n of the jews / The end of An tiochus.
but ^s he prepared himself unto a new betail / being at home fill down out of
an high place and hurt himself unto death as write some writers. And this
heuyechaunce was because he saw his own people and all other nations fall from
him which hated him for his cruelty and despised him for his beasily lyuinge.
For he which should have been grave sober and sad would dance and dalye
among mommers and maskers in open tau^rns and stews. He would drink dronken
among whores in every common house and skater money in the s^rcates / so that of
many men / he was no more called Epiphanes noble and clear but epimanis that is
to say / mad or out of his mind.

Now confer me the image of Antiochus unto our seclare emperors / kings
popes and bishops / which studeing to rai gne above all in all welthy pleasures
/ contend to destroy those princes which would receive the gospel: and they
s^inge all powrs both rulers and people chei^ly to be holden with supersticion /
luere and profits / craftily therefore they deuyse and invent worshippinges and
services which they know men will wonder at / and sone delight therein / and
menis myndis miche to be moved at these their prodigiose praises and apparent
deuocions with admiracions in their *sses thereby to meryt almaner goodness as
victories advantages and prosperose success / luere and good fortune in all
their affairs. And because ye wyked soul cannot wayt for help from God only
/ therefore it seeks many Gods and siche as they think will be sone pleased. And
for this cause is the worship and inuocacion of dead saintis very desyerose and
accepted / sone persuaded unto ignorant men. Aftir this begune the chirches to
be thrustfull of saints images whereof there followed ye most fierce madness in
gadding and running to commit idolatry. By this wild wodenes was ye doctrine
of ye rightwysemaking by faith and the true religion utterly extincted and the
supersticiouse tradicions of men received / with fylthey vows and sinful sole
lyuinge / difference of meatis of habits and siche like monstrose monkery
brought into ye church. And in these madnesses to be inverted they used
serpentyne subtyltye and bold arrogant audacite. For it is a very arroga^t act
(the word of god despised) to institute new worshippings or new doctrynes
against gods commandment or without his express word. And a subtyle deceyte is
it to study by what engines menis myndis might be trapped and snarled / and
what nettis might be bent and laid to augement their Anticrysten power lucre
and lustis. Wherefore by little and little as the riches of the popis kingdom
encreaced even so shall the riches / dominion and sinful pleasures grow up and
encreace in certain seculare kingdoms and in the Turks to / succedinge ye
romish beast in like or in crueller impiety and persecucion / wherefore they
that be yet sworn to the Romesh whore / or to any secular sone of perdicion /
they be retained partly by supersticion and partly with the great benefits
and profits they possess or be in hope to receive of these two rich beastis.
For hitherto pertayne the wordis of Daniel saing.

His innumerable riches with his Text.
appare^t prosperity shall deceive and sley many.

That is to say. Both these Anticrysten estates shall prouok many to siewe to
the^ for promocio^^ and dignities which being once retained / and they once
masshed / and morteused in their courtesy palaces / fetered with riches / lymed
with glory and dignites / glytering in their own conceyted reverence and
honor / then be they captiued of Anticryst sworn to his miserable and
dampnable service as ye see it this days. And as the spiritual Anticrystis
kingdom is not gotten nor defended by their own strength / but partly by the
supersticion of emperors and kings / even so be the seculare Anticrystis
ho^pen by the spiritual councels and conuocacio^s of their bisshops unto their
Anticrysten exaltacion and autorite above god. And all because ungodly men
gladly desyer and defend these their own so great profitis. As ye se now how
fiercely ye nobilite fights to reteyne in their handis / collegis abbeis
chauntres / bisshoprykes benefices / etc. for their own profit. And again /
the kings defend the pomp and pride of their bisshops that they might the
gloriouslier serve them in their courts and legacies / and might have their
hawles the gorgiouslier haunted and furnesshed with siche monstrose myters and
crooked crosses. And therefore says daniel.

He shall grow and that not by his own power and might. Text.


For the one anticrysten belybeast shall klaw the tothers bak one promouing the

the destruction of the the other. As did yt bishop Menelaius bringin and provoked
Antiochus so to rob the temple settinge before him so many rich proyes and
jewels and also the kingdom of the. Jews / so cruel a slaughter of innocents
made upon the resisters of their wykednes. And Antiochus again made Menelaius a
secular armed man with a great host having auctorite over the Jews / even as
now by the counsel and prouocacion of ye Bisshops to reteyne s^y^^ their
papistry shall certain seculare magistra^s take their pleasures over the
church goodis / (the very ecclesiasti offices and trw ministracio^s of the
word neglected and despised.) Also the seculare sort consydering
the bishops compelled kyndenes / to serve them again in their turn / shall
give them a company of armed men / at their desyers to exercise cruelty to
persecute the gospel and to press down crystis religion with their seculare
sword and to maintain the popis poisoned doctrine / yea and that against their
own consciences. For albeit many princes approve not their idols and tyranny
of the clergy / yet for their sakis they execute horrible cruelty. And in the
mean time they rejoice and smy^e on themselves with smothe countenances /
fayning this dampnable excuse. That they must defend the auctorite of the
church. Also where daniel says.

That deceit and fraud shall prosper in their handis. Text.


It has a large sense. First it signifies their falsely invented doctrynes with
gliteringe hypocrisye commended of the world / besydis this / it signifies ye
other crafty deceitful bondis whereby the spiritualty has b^wnd the kings and
emprours to them / or have minisshed their powrs plucking to themselves the
seclare possessions and their auctorite. And again it signifies the fraud of
the secular princes in pluckinge the riches and possessions of the spiritualty
into their own handis under some honest color of reformacion of the church /
abolishment of abuses heresies and schisms / or by promisinge to defend their
false faith and false religion. And now they both with a woundrefull craft and

incense emperors and kings craftily / to persecute and sley cruelly the
professors and prechers of gods word / as have the pope and his clergy labored

Whereby he signifies that before crystis last cominge / the gospel shall be
preched and setforth openly / which shall without weapens and humane power /

the people shall teach many men to beware and avoid Anticryst / but these
shall be smyten down with sword for their good doctrine. And then / says Paul
/ shall that wyked 2. these. 2.

as the gray morning gothe before the sone vprysinge. Here is it clear that this
prophecy is now verefied and perteyneth to this our time / wherein the
gospel is now so purely and so universally by gods infallible providence
publisshed both by bokis and prechers over all the world / as Daniel and Paul
declared it. That in these last days shall be great bataill and strife / and

idolatry and sleyeth ye godly / not to be the church / but a faccion and a
sinful sect rejected of god. And therefore Daniel exhorts almen to forsake
this Anticrysten church / as cryethe the angel in the Apocalypse saying.
Get ye forth avoid and fly out of Babylon. Agene / he conforteth the godly
which reb^ke and refute their errors certifyed themselves to have the
commandment of God for them / and in so ^ebukinge the ungodly / they ^e sewer
to please god / all god their study to be accepted of god / and that god
defends his own church / as says daniel plainly. The learned in the people
shall teache many and they shall fall etc. Nethelesse he promises the very trwe
church to continue and abide ferme and fast albeit many of them be slain for
the trwthe / for thus he says.

The people which know their god shall have the victory etc. Text.


Let us therefore not be afraid to steke to the profession of the trwe doctrine /

kingdoms / the seclar and spiritual anticrystis fall quyte away before the

Now yese anticryst to be one and many in succcessio^ / whether they be
ecclesiasti^^ or seculare / turk or Mahumete / even siche as be gone forth of
us (says Joan) and were never of our sort / sitting (as says paul) in the
place of God blaspheminge the name of god and persecuting his church / ye may
therefore compare our anticristis to Antiochus in every one of his wi^ed deadis
and blody persecu^ion of gods people / in robbyng and destroing the temple of
God / and they that be deceived of him ar seduced worthily for their sins.
For this is the most greuouse plage / eue^ to be castenvp of god to obey and
believe false doctrine / and therefore says Paul / 2 these. 2.
shall god send or cast them up into the most strong illusions to believe lies
that all shuldbe dampened which have not believed the trwthe / but have approved
and consented to vnrightwysnes. This anticryst (says Paul) shall work his
frauds in them that be forlorn because they received not the love of the trwth
whereby they might have been saved. There are this day Iasons Alcimus and
M^nelai^sses betrayers traditours simoniaks sent us, ^ue^ the childern of this

chiefly worshipped / out of these mo^sters there brekein upon us tyrantis exe
cuting their tyranny above mesure with out pity which may not hear the glory
and word of god spoken of. These, these ar the very rank cheiftains of all
heretics / bold / arrogant and vnshamefaced / these are not ashamed to lie
openly in pulpits / nether be they ashamed what and how great open crimes or
mischief so ever they commit. These men had leifer all the world to be

anticristis into lucre and al ve^tew into vice. They wreste the word to serve
their affeccions. The sacraments they have made their money nettis: their

then any int^rpretour that yet expowneth it besides the aungel. But as he
pressed Paul 2. Cor. 12
so did he refrain daniel lest by the great excellency of so high a
reuelacion he should have been puffed up. And therefore was he made syke lest he
should have been extolled by siche high secret visions. Aftir the vision and

to be hyden / and sealled up for the time / lest the Jews hearing thereof and
knowing themselves to suffer yet more so greuouse calamities and plages in
Jerusalem / they would have tarried rather still in Babylon and never have made

So be it.

Unto daniel praying for the remission The argument of the. ix chapter.
of his and the peples sins and for the return of the people into their own
cou^trye / it is showed plainly them to return home agene / to restaure their
cite and temple / which done / within. 490. years / Messiah to be borne which
should perform all things prophesied in the law and prophetis. Who by the most
horrible sins of the Jews slain / the Romans should destroy utterly all
Iewry with their common weall. A like matter find ye not in all the scriptures.
In the. 8. chap. ye have seen how greuouse affliccions should come over the
Jews by Antiochus and their own bishops in the third monarchy. Now shall ye
see what horrible calamities followed in the. iiii. and last Monarchy / even
the most cruel destruction that ever was of the Jews / and what greuouse
persecucions our Anticrystes under this last monarchy shall excercyse to the
end of the world. For in this last monarchy it was prophesied christ to be
borne and crucified / whose death and persecucion both of his own body of his
members and of his allmighty sauinge word / because it is the most horrible
blasphemye and greuousest crime / it requires the most heuey plage and most
merciless blodye destruction. Now therefore awake ye persewers of christ and his
word / lift up your heuye headis / and repent / be ye converted to god / for
the axe of his wrath is now bent at the tree rote / the sword is drawn and
forth stretched to smite down the wyked persewers of his word.

supplicacion and prayers using them in abstinence sak and ashes.

Cyrus king of the Persies / and Darius The kings of ye Persike and Medis
monarchy.
the sone of Astyagis were the first kings of the second Monarchy called
the Persians and Medis. This Darius reigned but two year with Cyrus and is not
that Darius here mentioned the sone of Ahasueri. Cyrus was called far of / to

sone Cambyses to reign in his stead at home in the land of Persie / Cyrus was
slain of the Scithians as writes Herodotus / aftir whom his cruel sone
Cambyses reigned skant one year / of this Darius that first reigned with Cyrus
there is mention in dani. 5. and. 6. For it was he that suffered Daniel to be
casten to the lions. Aftir Cambyses death (for that he was wyked and forbode
the buylding of ye temple and return of the Jews which all his father Cyrus
commanded) the posterite Magi.
of the kingis of the Medis was extinct, Cambyses dyinge without yssewe. Then
the Magi / which were the preistis did set up one of their faccion to rule the
empire: but he was sone put down and slain. Then was the second Darius

chosen by the neinge of the horse / which was called Darius Hystaspis / and of
Metasthene called Priscus Artaxerxes / and Ahassue^us which had to wife queen

/ bywhom he had this man called here Darius also / tonamed Longimanus or
Darius Hystaspis his sone. Cyrus reigned. xxii. years / Cambyses one year /
and Magi one year. Ahasuerus. xx. year / and thus have ye. 44. years from the
end of the captivity and of the. 70. years mentioned in Ieremye to this first
year of Darius Longimane Ahasuerus son. In the which daniel here prays
remembering the. lxx. years of Iere. For all this long while ceased the
building of the cite and temple and miche people of the Jews remained still at
Babylon and in Persie with Daniel / Esdra and Neemia^ the cause why the most
part tarried yet still dispersed among the gentiles was / for some had their
substance among them some saw that the work at home was so forboden of
Cambyses / that it went not forthward and despeyered of the reedificacion
thereof / and some did set naught by that goodly land of Judah / but had rather
pleasure in the idols of the gentyles then in the true religion of God / many
moo causes there were of their so long taryinge. For it was as hard a return
from Babylon to Judea as was from out of Egypt into the same land / and
lengere were they in returninge now / ere they were all brought from Babylon.
For they returned / here now some / and then some / as Cyrus permitted them /
the buyldinge being forboden / and let all these. 44. years / unto ye
second year of thissame Darius Longimane: so horribly hatethe god sin.
Wherefore daniel now saying the lxx. years of Ieremye past / and also more then.
xl. years to / and yet the most part of the people there taryinge still and
nether temple nor cite of Jerusalem builded / he consydering the sins of the
people to be the cause of this breach and delay / fill to prayer as ye see him
inflammed there unto / at the reading of Ie^emye calling now upon god almighty
and the most merciful father of Jesus Christ our delyuerer / to be made
certeiner / not only of the time of Jerusalem to be re^difyed and ^yen to be
at last utterly destroyed / but also of the time of the coming of christ into
flesh / which time to know so insily was given to no prophet so long before
/ but only to Daniel / of the which example of Daniel to be followed of all
ministers of ye word / we may learn not only by the readinge of the
prophetis to ask consolacion / but also by the example of the prophetis to
ask to be delivered from the curse of the law and to obtain of god the
promises in christ. What think ye daniel thus turned to god and seking the
lord prayed to obtain and to be putt from him? Verily even this that ye see
folowinge in his prayer / wherein ye may see how he used the difference of the
law and gospel. But let us hear Daniel prayinge.

In making my prayer unto the lord Text.
my God / I confessed my self saying: Daniels prayer.
I beseech the oh lord god / great and to be feared / kepinge covenant and
mercy with them that love the and observe thy preceptis hear me. We be
sinners and have offended / we have done ungodly / and are fallen from thy
commandment and gone bake from thy laws. We have not heard thy servants the
prophets which in thy name taught and spoke to our kings to our rulers / to
our fathers and to all the people of the land. With the (oh lord) is
rightwysnes / but shame is now unto us / as thou seist it / even to us the
Jews cytisens of Jerusalem / and Israelits nyghe and far of dispersed and
scatered of the into all the nations for these sins which we have committed
against the. Oh god / ours is the shame / even the shame of our own kings of
our rulers and of our fathers because both we and they have sinned against
the. But it is thy property / oh lord / both to have mercy and to forgive
us / for we have forsaken the / we have not obeyed the voice of our lord god
to live aftir his law setforth before us by his servants the prophets. For
all Israel has transgressed thy law / yea and has fallen bak from the / the^
have not obeyed thy voice. Because we have thus sinned / lo the curse and oath
written in the law of Moses thy servant / are powered forth upon us. He has
paid us in deed with his word which he spoke against us and our iuges / which
should have told us the law so that they have brought us into so great
calamite / that under the hole heaven is there not so dealt with any nation as
it is now happened to Jerusalem. For as it is written in the law of Moses /
even so are all the plages Deu. 27.
and curses casten upon us. Nether called we upon our lord God for grace to
go fro and forsake our wykednes and to know thy trewthe. Wherefore god has not
slept to cast these miserable plages upon us / for i^sre is the lord our god
in all his works he does. Ah / we have not obeid his voice. Now therefore Oh
lord our God which haste ledforth thy people out of the land of Egypt by thy
power so mighty / and thereby didist get thyself so great a name which yet unto
this day thou e^ioyeste. But ^e ar the sinners and have lived so ungodly and
wykedly. Oh sorde / for thy most excellent rightwysemakinge sake let thy
wrath go from us / and thy anger from thy cite Jerusalem that same thy holy
hill and be blown over it. Fore owr sins and for ye wykednesses of our
fathers Jerusalem and thy people are made an ignominiouse lawghig stok unto owr
dwellers Exo. 15.
rownde about us. Now therefore (our Baruh. 2
god) hear the supplicacion of thy servant hear his prayers beseching the to
show a merciable countenance upon thy holy temple thus desolated and destroid
/ Oh forde god show it / for the lordis sake incline thine ear (my god) and
hear / open thine eyes and behold how desolated we be / and how forsaken is
thy cite which bears thy name. For not in our own prayers powered forth before
the* do we allege our own rightwysenes / but thy most rich infinite mercy
bring we forth for us. Ah lord / hear / lord be merciful and spare us /
lord attend / help / and cease not / my God / even for thy nowne sake do it
/ for thy cite and thy people are called aftir thy name.

Oh / how full of humble and fervent affectis is this prayer. Daniel himself
was in high favor with the king and in no bondage nor affliccion / but the
sorrow that he ^oke was for the calamity of the people / desolacion of the
temple / and neglect of Gods worship. And are there not now as great occasions
given us to weep and to pray thissame prayer? verily if we behold these
troublos last blody days and the cruel persecucion of the crystianes in
every land / the famyne / ye murders / the dearthe / and the trwe worship of
God extincted with idolatrye / in how dampnable a state all the world is / how
ripe and rank is all sin and iniquite / what vanites lies falsehed errors
deceit enuy^ rankor theft whordo^ pride hypocrise reign / and all truth
rightwysenes with faith and love to be exyled / we would verily confess with
Daniel all these plages and pun^ssheme^ts to come over us worthily for o^^e
own greuouse and manifold sins. But what do owr wea bisshops and prelates
which should in this (...) play daniels part with prayers? They persecute and
sow forth al ye seads of al these calamities and mischief. Ah lord that this
owr age is thus destitute of Daniel. Send us oh lord some daniels for cristis
sake. But to the payer.

This place stands of prayer and repentance flowing forth out of the
knowledge of the law and gospel. For as does all the scripture / so does this
prayer breathe forth here and there ye law and gospel. Repe^tan ce.
Wherefore because repentance or contricion the mother of prayer bring forth
the confession.
confession of sins and this confession prayth to avoid the punisshements /
and Faith. prayer.
the pains of syne to be put away / for that she considers the comminacions
of the law / and prayth for remission according to ye promises of the gospel /
let us note wc part of the prayer expresses the law and which the gospel.
Daniel begineth of the confession or praise of the rihtwysenes of god governing
the world with his threatenings and promises. For where he calls god great
and terrible he signifies god by the execucion of his threatenings to show
himself greater and ferefuller then all his enemies even the brekers of his 10.
wordis. But where he says / god to keep covenant with them that love him / he
shewth God by the fulfilling of his promises to give a thousand fold more
benefits and goodness to the godly the^ they be able to ask or deserve.

Daniel remembering the prophecye of Jeremy was moved thus to pray / teching us
/ in trouble to fetch consolacio^ at the promises of god by reading ye
scriptures / here be we taught that albeit god had promised to bring them home
aye^ / yet would he us instantly to pray and to ask the same God would us to
ask both bodily and gostly benefits.
benefit of himself to thente^t that our faith should be exercised by prayers
and inuocacion / as says christ / ask and ye shall receive your peticions.
Also call upon me in the time of your tribulacion and I shall deliver you. He
wills also by this meanis our repentance to encreace / as says zachary. Be
ye turned to me and I shall turn me to you. And in that he praith for the
restoring of the congregation / he gives us example unfeignedly with heart to
lament the persecucio^ and calamities of cristis church and to pray god to
encreace govern and preserve it. It displeases god greuouslye when men sitting
in ease and securite be not moved with pity at ye Amos. ^
calamities troubles and persecucions of the pore church of god as Amos
complains / sai^g w^ be to the weal^^ rich / wc be not moved with heuin^^
and piety to see Joseph which is ye people of god broken slain and persecuted.
Daniel therefore co^sideringe this thing with pity / begineth his prayer with so
greuouse an heuye sorrowful sighe and complaynt of their sins reciting their
great payns and affliccions. Which prayer we ought daily now to pray together
in the chirches. Here is setforth the doctrine of repentance. For daniel
aknowlegeth the sins of the people attributina to god the praise of
rightwysmakinge and that he had justly punisshed them. Then he prayth for the
remission of their sins and to be reducte into their land. It is therefore
the beginning of repentance or contricion to aknole The beginning of repentance.
ge the wrath of god against our sins / to fear him / and to lament that we
have offended our so graciouse god / to give him laud and praise for that he
has by just punisshment calde us bake to obaye him / patiently suffering his
hand. This confession daniel reciteh saing: with the (oh lord) is there
rightwysnes / but with us is there open confusion and shame to our faces. This
is the very voice of trwe contricion 31. and ^1
as has the psalm. I said I shall co^ fesse my sins to the lord and he
forgave me my iniquities Ayene. Against ye says David ^^ I ^^tels but a sinner
and evil in thy sight have I done / that thou shuldst be fownde trw in thy
promises and over come when thou art iuged: that is to say / The ve^ se of the
psalm. expowned.
I knowledge myself to be not else but a sin ner and guilty in thy sight / vt
iustificeris that is. In thus confessing myself I preise and declare thy just
punisshment and also thy victory whiles perverse ypocrites judge the (oh lord)
to be to roughe and rigourose against this owrsinfull nature accusing and
conde^pning thy just iugeme^ts for that they cannot submitt themselves worthy
to suffer thy hand, aknowleging themselves worthily punisshed. And here is the
grinning anger and preuey poison in menis hertis ere they can confess god
justly to plage them fortheir sins / and so confess their sins to him and
humbly ask forgeuenes / as ye may see in the 3. verse of the. 32. Psalm. david
saing whiles Psalm. 32.
I now held my tongue and woldnot confess my secret sins / there tormented
me greuouse vexacion even in my bones with continual out roaring. For day and
night thy hand ley so heuey upon me pressing me down that my moistnes was
turned into the somer drynes. And therefore Paul often inculketh these two wordis.
God to be declared just and also justifying / that Romans 3.
we might praise him whylis he justly punissheth us and then not ascribing to
ourselves any part of our rightwyse making: but believe that god is the only
iustifier / that is / oureselues then to be pronownced justified / when god
has me^^y on us and forgeueth our sins. It is sone said. God is just and
justifying / but out of the botome of our hertes patiently with tears to
aknowlege the gretenes of our sins and to feel ourselves justly punisshed for
them and so humbly to ask forgeuenes for only crystis sake / is sampsons
work and hercules labor. Necessary / it is / this doctrine of repentance and
contricion to be often and continually preched to yt chirches that they might
trwly aknolege their sins to God / and for their sins verily know it / all
these calamities affliccions war and plages to be powerd forth upon them. As
Jeremy says. 5. Owr sins have thrust all goodness from us. And that in so
doing our lord god declares himself just and rightwise in all his workis
and is not the author of evil though they apere evil to owe sinful nature evil
iuging of god which will have the victory when he is thus iuged. But faith
must be the companion of Faith must be annexed to true penance
this co^tricion and setfast hold upon the promises. As here daniel not only
says / with the / oh sorde / there is just dealinge and rightwysnes in
punisshinge / but he adds also / with the is there mercy and forgeuenes / by
which so often repeted, he play nely excludes our own meryts / addinge / not
in our rightwysnes and just living do we ask it of yt / but for thy great
mercyes sake and for thy nowne anointed crystis sake. Let us therefore use these
prayers and exercise these doctrynes unto the which both the publyke and
private calamities should excite us. And namely now when the church of christ
is no less persecuted then it was in the Babylony^^^ exylie. Wherefore this
prayer ought now in the congregacions to be as effectuously and as fervently
sunge and said for the chirches as did daniel in his like troublose days.

And whylis I was speking in my Text.
prayer and confessinge mine own sins and the sins of my people Israel / and
layinge forth my supplicacion before the lord my god for the holy hill of my
god / whylis I was (I say) yet in prayinge / Before in ye. 8. chap
the man Gabriel whom before I had seen in my vision / came swystly fleinge unto
me and touched me about the eueninge oblacion time / teaching me / and speking
with me saing. Daniel now am I comen forth to give ye knowleg. Nethelesse
as soon as thou beganest to pray thy prayers were granted fermely / but I am
come to tell it the / because thou art so desyerouse to known these things /
that thou moughtst in very deed by express word know it / and understand
the vision.

Here must ye return to the vision of daniel in the later end of the. 8.
chap. co^cerninge Anticryst / whereof Daniel was more troubled then certifyed /
which vision was told him to come to pass aftir a long time and was boden to
close up the vision / but so that this vision was ever in his mind / studeinge
thereof and desyering to know it more clearly / and therefore the angel
calls him here ye man of desyers or couetinge to know these things in his
daily prayers: but now at last he seeing that the. lxx. years of their captivity
were past and more then. xl. years also ouergone he prayed most effectuously
and fervently with express wordis as ye have seen it. Wherefore ye angel
Gabriel is come to him to teach him more clearly of the vision. By this
Daniels prayer and confession we ought to learn how studiouse and sorrowful we
should be for other men's affliccio^s even as for our ^^^. It is therefore a
great offense not to be moved with pity at the plages of the people committed to
thy cure and not to pray for them / which I confirm with ye example of Samuel
saying: Far fro me be this sin / that I should cease to pray god for you and
to teach you the right way. Also in that the angel came so swiftly and
touched him spekinge with him so familiarely / it is showed us / the angels to
be the servants and ministers to the chosen at all times redye to standby and
teache the prechers and techers of the word in things concerning our health
and salvation. Also of the angels wordis saying: Thy peticion was granted ere
thou beganest to pray / we be taught / that before we begyne to pray / our
peticions Isa. 65.
to be heard in heaven / the lord saying: Before they shall call upon me I
shall answer them / whylis yet they be spekinge I will hear them. Also as
Daniels example inflammeth us to pray to God and to believe our prayers to be
heard before they be ended / even so does Gabriels example counforte us to
believe angels to be present with be praying / and to fight for us always against
the ga it is of hell. But Gabriel exciteth daniel to be attent that he might in
very deed and in express words understand the vision. Wherefore let us hear
Gabriel declaring plainly yt time of crystis coming / his death / our
redemption / the ceassing of the Jews ceremonies / the prechinge of the
gospel / the taking away of ye sins and utter fall of the Jews common we
all. And here is to be noted / that when the people in captivity thought all the
prophecies of christ to be frustrate / and themselves almost in despayer: then
god of his mercy conforted them with this assewered promise of Messiah to come
saying:

Wherefore know thou and understand it / that from the time wherein it is
proclaimed that Jerusalem be builded agene / unto the prince Messiah: the^ be.
vii. hebdomads / and. 62. hebdomads. For the streatis and wallis shall be
reedifyed: but a long and hard time ere they be seteled in quiet. Or (as has
some textis) albeit in an hard time with difficulte.

Where and when we should begyne the rekening of these. 70. hebdo. which make
490. years / there has been myche varia^ce among yt writers / but now is ye
prophecye of daniel. 12. chap. fulfilled / sayng: Many shall turn over this
book and there by shall their knowledge be encreaced. The text says: From the
proclamacion of ye buyldinge again of Jerusalem / but it shows not of whose
proclamacion. There were. 2 proclamacio^s as ye read in. 1. of Esdras. The
first was given forth by Lyrus immediately aftir the end of the. lxx. years in
the first year of Lyrus. And the second by Darius in his second year aftir
daniel had made his prayer. Betwixt the first proclamacion and the second
there were. xlii. years in all the which time ye buylding ceased and was
let nothing in a manner done / till the. 2. year of this Darius and then
begane they a fresshe at his commandment and license to build / so that in
the. 6. year of Darius ye temple was finisshed. And aftir yt finisshinge of the
temple / there were. xii. years ere ye cite and wallis were full made. And there
fore the text says: That the streatis and wallis shall be reedifyed / but in so
hard and troublose a time that long shall it be ere they be seteled therein as
before. For there were. lxx. years from ye first license ere all was finisshed
and the Jews all returned and settled in Jerusalem. For as soon as the. lxx.
years of their captivity were expyred / the Jews by the favor of Lyrus / some
repared into Judea with gold and gyftis of the king Lyrus where with he bode
them build their temple. Then as soon as they came there they builded an
altar and prepared themselves spedely to build their temple laying the
foundacions thereof: but they were let of their purpose more then. xlii.
years. Nethelesse at last under Darius Longimane Lxx. years in ca ptiuite /
and. 70. in redifyinge.
the temple was builded up in. 4. years and dedicated. Aftir this / returns
Esdras from Babylon which restored their laws and iugements and corrected
certain great vices of the people / and of the bisshops and preistis of the
congregation / which they had souktoute of ye gentyles and heythen, in those.
140. years brought up among them. Aftir Esdras there came Nehemias from the
captivity into the holy land / which restored and with wallis defended the
cite. This story conteyneth. lxx. years. For from the first year of Lyrus unto
ye. xx. year of Darius Longimani there be gathered. lviii. years / and from
thence forth to his. 32. year (he reigned. 37. year) are gathered. 12. years
wherein the wallis and cite were restored / which all make. lxx. troublose
years. Here may we se the wrath of god against sinners punisshed and plaged
above. 100 years / albeit they were his derely peculiare people. But yet be we
counforted again saying at last how happily God stered up Darius Longima. to
accomplesshe their desyers. This miche be said for the storye and time of the
buylding again of the temple and cite. Now let us ere we reken these. lxx.
hebdomads treat the benefits promised to be received and brought us with
Christ.

First he says: The sins shall be co^fumed The benefits of god exhi bited by
christ.
/ transgressions kouered and iniquite purged etc. Oh good god / whatsoever
goodness in all the scriptures / god by and for crysts sake has promised
himself to give to mankind / that same does daniel prophecye here / to be
given us aftir / and in the end of these. lxx. hebdomads that is in the end
of. 490. years. Transgressions to be consumed / is, God never more to impute
nor reken / nor remember Sins consumed.
the sins of the repentante beleuers in christ: as himself says: Thy sins
shall I never remember. Sins to be covered Iere. 31.
is the imperfect obedience of the law and Ezec. 18.
the not fulfylling of the same, to not be imputed to the beleuers for crystis
sake the fulfyllinge of the law for us. His rightwysenes and fulfylling of the
law kouereth our vnrightwysnes and our brekinge of the law: for he is the
perfect fulness 1. Cor. 1. Romans 10. and.8.
of the law to iustifye every beleuer: For whosoever is borne of God / synneth
not: Unto them that love god / all things tend 1. Ioa^. 3.
unto their salvation. Romans 8. Iniquite to be pourged / is the beleuers through
Iniquite to be purged.
only faith in the death and resurreccion of christ / from the malediccion of
the law or perpetual dampnacion to be delivered and to obtain the
benediccion promised to Abraham which is eternal salvation. As Moses exalted
the serpent so it behooved the sone of man to be lyfted up on the cross that
the beleuers perish not but have life everlasting. Of the expiacion of sins
read the epistle to the Hebrews even the very maistres techinge to discern
christ from Moses. The everlasting the everlasting rightwysenes.
rightwysnes or the rightwysnes of worldis aftir the Hebrewe phrase) is christ
/ so made of the father unto all that by faith and confidence reche the mercy
of god promised them in / and for crystis passion and thereby only to be saved
and rekened rightwyse. Through out all ye age^ of the world unto the end /
have / and shall be all faithful justified for believing christ to be their
rightwysnes / holiness / redemption and reconciliacion unto our 1. Cor. 1.
father celestial. Abraham so believed and it was rekened him for rightwysnes.
My iu Isa. 53.
ste servant / in the knowledge of him / shall iustifye many / for he bears
away ye sins of them. The just lives of his faith Hitherto perteyneth
whatsoever is in ye gospel of Joan and in the epistles of Paul to the Romans and
Galathe^s spoken of the article of iustificacion / with this perpetual
rightwysnes God has sealled up ratifyed and said Amen to all the visions
promises and prophecies seen and spoken by the mouths of all the prophets.
So that whatsoever benefit health or salvation God has promised / the same the
beleuers do ask in crystis name and obtain it for crystis sake. For christ was
made Romans 1^.
the minister of circumcision for the verite of god unto the promises made to
our fathers to be confirmed. This most holy one to be anointed / is christ
which did no sin / to be made of god for us the Romans 8.
expiacion and cleansing offrance upon ye altar of the cross for our sins
/ that we so believing might be made the rightwysnes 2. Cor. 5.
of god through him / of whose fulness Joan. 1.
we all receive grace and forgeuenes for that love and favor which god the
father Anointed.
bears unto christ. To be anointed / is to be sent to preche the law and
gospel by the holy ghost signified by oil. 1. Joan. 2 Isa. 61.
The anoyntinge of preistis and kings / them to preche / and these to se their
doctrine observed and the transgressors punisshed / prefigured the anointing
of christ with the spirit and him to be both king and preiste. We may here
tremble and quake to see the horrible wrath of god against sin / for by no
manner wise might death, the reward of sin, be taken away but only by the
death of ye sone of man Jesus christ / nor life be repared but by the
resurreccion of the sone of God Jesus Christ. But this holy anointed has god
the father signed and sealled (as Joan says) even only christ has he sent
that all that Joan. 6.
believe / through him should live everlasting. Wherefore as the church before
crystis incarnacion counforted herself with this promise of god / that aftir.
490. years the savior of the world should come and ^xx heb dom. are 490. years.
reign whiles yet the common weall of Jerusalem should endure / even so / we
which abide and look for his second coming confirm our faith meruellously by
the same testimonye and receive thereby great consolacion. These infinite rich
benefits received by christ thus briefly declared / let us haast to the
rekeninge of the hebdomadis.

First in general Daniel propowneth The rekeninge of the 70 hebdom.
lxx. hebdo. yet to come forth restauring of the temple and cite and for the
Jews unto crystis coming into flesh and so forth to the utter destruction of
the cite / of the Jews / and of their common weall / rytes / sacrifices / cere.
etc. before ye which miserable destruction all these things prophesied of
Christ should be fulfilled. Then he divides this hole nowmber into. the first
division of ye heb. and into. 7. hebdom.
3. special parts / that is / into. 7. hebd. and into. lxii. hebdo. and at
last into one hebdo. It is iuged of some that he begane with. 7. hebdom.
multiplied by. x. times. 7. so to make. 70. years / having a respect to these.
70. troublose years wherein the cite and temple were so long let and hindered
of their buyldinge ere they cold be settled / which was thought a very long time
to men in trouble holden so long from their desyered native land and
thirsting so fervently their city and temple to be restored that they might
the frelyer / exercise their religion. And therefore. Some writers begine the
acompte at the first year of Cyrus / for it was an hard 7. heb. be 49 years
and heuye ceason to them / all these first 7 hebdomads which make. xlix.
years in which last hebdom. that is in the. 46. year the temple was finisshed
/ as the Jews told Christ / saying. 46. year has this Joan. 2.
temple been in buyldinge / and will thou break it down and redifie it in. 3.
days? They that begine ye rekeninge of these. 7. and. 62. hebdom. (which make.
483. years) 7. hebdo.
at king Cyrus first year / do end it at crystis and. 62. heb be. 483. years.
birthe. The angel calls the space of these first. 7. hebdom* a straight or
hard time / for because that whylis they were buyldinge their cite and temple
/ they were so molested and assawted of their enimyes lettinge and resistinge
their buylding / that they wrought with one hand / holding their swerdis in
the the other hand / nether made they their mortar nor did other labors about
it / but were gyrte with swerdis having weapens ready by them / which
difficultye techeth us that the church of christ with the gospel cannot be
edifyed without like difficultye and perell to the buylders and prechers / the
adversaries ever resistinge with contrary commandments / inhibicions and
prohibicions of emprour and kingis and greuou* se persecucio^s by their
inquisitors / as we see it this day / so strongly let by the emprour / and
popish kingis blaspheming the gospel with names of heresye / and the true
prechers they call heretics.

Some begine to reken from the. 2. year of Darius Longimane ending the. lxix.
hebdom. (which contayn. 4^3. years) at ye baptism of christ being then. xxx.
year of age. And these men take the last hebdom. for the. 7. years following /
that is sor the. 3 years and an half wherein he preched and was crucified / and
for the. 3. years and half aftir Byliander and bull linger with th^irchi^ che.
his resurreccion. ^other great learned and men of sharp and syncer judgment /
begine at the. 32. year of Darius Longimane / and end these. lxix. hebdomads
just at Crystis birthe diligently proved / first by the wordis of the angel
saying: Ab exitu verbi vt restituatur Jerusalem / that is / from the full
accomplishme^t of the thing proclaimed / concerning the reedifying of
Jerusalem / which accomplishment and full finishment of the work was done in
the. 32. of Darius Longi. Now from the. 32. year of Darius Longimane unto the
birthe of christ be / 7. hebd. and. 62. hebdo. years 483. which account (because
ye stories of the Bible here cessed by ye reason of so troublouse a captivity
and time) is certeynly gathered of these learned men by the Grekis Olympiad^ the
most sewerst account and rekeninge. Now aftir these men remains the last
hebdomade in which christ was borne and slain and Jerusalem destroyed. For this
last hebdomade must nedis be of a another rekeninge say they multiplied by. 10.
to make. lxx. years / which space runeth betwixt the birth of christ and the
utter destruction of the common weall of the Jews by Titus themprour of Rome.
For the prophecy by these. lxx. hebd. recheth from the buyldinge of the city
to the fynall destruction of the same as ye shall se it here plain in the text
/ wherefore it cannot end in any one hebdo of. 7. years / but in ye hebd. of.
70. years / as did the space from the first proclamacion by Cyrus to the
finishment in the. 32. of Darius co^tayne likewise. lxx. years. Also it is to
be noted that as ye angel begineth his account at the Jews full liberty and
full finishment of their temple and cite / even so ends he his rekening in
their full liberty and perfect salvation offered them by christ / and at their
utter destruction for slayinge him so iently offered them.

But me thinks / that this nowmber of these. lxx. hebd. begun at Cyrus /
should not be so continued / that the one and last hebdom. should immediately
follow the lxii. hebd. because the angel having rather a respect to the
stories and gestis done in either of them / distributeth them into. 3. parts /
first giving to the. 7. heb. the buylding of the city and temple with siche
difficulty / and in the second nou^ber of. 62. hebd. he gives the
persecucion to the Jews under the second and third monar. unto Antiochum /
and so forth to the taking away of the scepter from Judah: aftir the which
shame and obprobry to the Jews / he tells them what shall come to them in
the last hebd. for ye death and kylling of Messiah.

And therefore he says: And aftir Text.
the. 62. heb. Messiah shall be sleyne / and the Jews utterly undone and
destroyed. The second distribucio^ of ye he^.


That is / aftir the. 62. hebdo. be ended and the scepter taken away / christ
shall be. slain / but not immediately / for there were* 81* years betwixt the
end of the. 62. hebd. and the death of christ. A like speech is it. That aftir
the taking away of the scepter / Sylo should come / but not immediately / for
he came not till. 47. years aftir the taking away thereof.

Albeitkinge Cyrus of a good heart gave them license to depart and build their
cite / yet was it not finisshed in his days For the good purposes of kings be
oftyn times let / for nothing can they do except god say Amen. The wrath of
God for our sins / is the cause that with so great difficultye ye temple of
god is not yet finisshed / but rather let so cruelly. But yet propter
Christum promissum / for crystis sake promised us / it shall be at last although
with great difficulty and loss of many a good manis life finisshed. But here
lo / was the Jews city / temple and A monicion for keisar and kingis.
all their common weall utterly destroyed for the slayinge of christ. Let all
christian emperors / kings and bisshops that yet slaye christ in his members
beware and wait for a like destruction. The text has. Et nihil ei / that is /
and nothing to him / Some understand it of Christ / As this might be the sense
/ Messiah shall be slain / and yet could they lay no cause worthey of death to
him. Some understand it of the Jews as I have translated it / signifyinge
that because they shall putt him to death / they shall be undone and utterly
destroyed. For aftir that full mesure finisshed of their wykednes in denyinge
and slaying their king / they shall nether have any more king nor priest nor
ruler nor temple nor cite / no they shall no more be called the people of god.
For they cried and denied him to be their king / saying: We have no king over
us / but the emperor and therefore it follows.

For there shall come a mighty army Text.
of the emperor and destroy both their city and temple. yea / their
destruction and end shall be as it were with a diluuie. Diluuie is nohes floude.
And aftir the bataill their shall be an utter perpetual vastitude and
destruction of them.

Lo / they refused their own king christ for the emperor / sayng: We have no
king but the emperor / and now see how beneficial the emperor was to them:
like wise our spiritualtye this day refuse the gospel and christ, giving up
their auctorite power and goods to emperors and kingis to defend their
kingdom. But in short space shall ye see their seclare emperors and kings
serve them worthily as Titus and his host served the Jews / their city and
temple. He compares their miserable destruction to the floude of Nohe. For
very few or none of the Jews were left in Jerusalem so destroyed / but all
were slain or famisshed or dyed of the stink and pestelent corrupcion of
their dead innumerable carkases or else carried away captiued as a vehement
floude caryeth all away with it. For very hard sharp and bitter was that
consuming siege and storm. The Romans with many / often / and diverse assawtes
beat down the Jews miserably / and aftir the batails were done there remained
a perpetual vastite and deso^acion. For never aftir was it / nor shall their
Leuiti^ preis^hed nor their kingdom of Judah / nor the policye and common weall
of Moses nor city of Jerusalem be restored. But as I say / Ieremei / O see
said: Aftir that calamitose destruction / should the gentiles be called the
people of God / which enbrace the gospel as it is written Romans 9. and. 10.
Plain it is the Jews often aftir this destruction to have had enforced to
reedifye and restore their common weall of Moses. For in ye time of Adrian
emperor they gathered them thither a great multitude inuadinge ye land with
armor. But Adriane putting them to flight destroyed many of them. Aftir that /
Iuliane the apostata / for the hatered he bore to the christian religion /
granted the Jews license to reedifye their cite and temple. The work was
Begune and miche money gathered to perform it. But with many terrible earth
qua^is and flammes of fire out of the foundation / the edificacion was throne
down and miche people slain with the stones and timber falling upon them. Also
Nazianzene tells that their clothes were wondrefully stained thik with red
figures of the cross / as it were with blood imprinted in their clothes /
wherefore the Jews thus afraid with these celestial wondrefull signs left
their work and fled from the place. For god had decreed their policy
neuermore to be restored. God would have thexample of his wrath seen of all the
gentylee to monissh us thereby / and that he would horribly and terribly
punisshe and plage the contempt and crucifyinge of his sone (he is yet daily
crucified afresshe among the papistis) He will also that Moses common weall be
buried with Moses no more to be seen nor known / left the opinion and faith in
their ceremonies and rytes be co^ firmed / men believing to be justified with
the Jews by their rytes / ceremonies / workis and tradicions.

Also one hebdomade shall confirm Text.
the covenant made with many men. The. 3 di stribucio^ into one hebdom.
And the middis of this hebdomade shall abolishe and abrogate sacrifice and
oblacion.

Here he attribueth to the hebd. the same thing that perteyneth to christ. For
christ in this hebd. confirmed his testament and and covenant (as Paul disputes
it largely to the Hebrews) by his death and sacrifice once for all and for
ever sufficient. This one hebd. recheth from the birth of christ unto the
destruction of the city / co^teyning lxx. years. In the middis of this hebdo.
that is in the. 34. year of crystis age the Jews fulfilled the mesure of
their wykednes by kyllinge him / and so were they worthily rejected. This
hebdom. the angel divides in the middis geuinge the first half to christ
preching and suffering and to the other half to the people and cite to their
sacrifices and rytes all to cease and be abolisshed. For himself hanging on
the cross said that all was ended / and inclined his head and yielded up his
spirit / which done / the veyle of the temple was kut in sondre from the
highest to the lowest part / that by these woundrose signs god would testifye
to the herdnecked Jews by the host and oblacion of his sone all the figurative
sacrifices now to be ceased and gone. Well therefore says the angel: In the
middis of this heb. shall cease the hosts and sacrifices. But this thing
would not the Jews believe / but went on still with their wont and sometime holy
(but now unlawful and to be abhorred) sacrifices to be offered. And ye holy
men which thus preched they persecuted and banisshed and many they slew for
this so soden a gospel and new lerning as do our phariseis. But yet did god by
his long pacient suffra^ce call them to repentance / by all the rest of this
the other half hebdomade / even. 35. years following yea and with threatenings he
would have frayd them from their conceived pertinate styffe malice / but all was
in vain / as ye see it like wise this day wherein we Beware within these. 15.
years to come. 15. years to come.
have had like warnings these. 20. years. Here also may ye see the figurall
temple and cite corresponding the verite / for as that material temple and
cite were builded in those first. lxx. years next aftir ye captivity / with so
great difficulty and anxt / even so in this last hebd. containing also lxx.
years / was the very city and temple of Crystis body the church with as
great perell and difficulty builded and finished by his death in the middis of
this hebd. as himself in ye middis of this heb. declared it saying: destroy ye
this temple / and in. 3. days shall I rear it up agene And I say. 53.
confirms ye same / saying: With the perell of his own life shall he find
riches. Christ begane to confirm and stablisshe his covenant when he begane to
preche his gospel adding the testimonies of the law and prophetis to confirm
his doctrine. And when he was risen he begane his eternal kingdom declaring
himself to be the geuer of rightwysnes and life eternal / he sent his Apostles
to gather his church out of the gentyles / and endewed them with his spirit
whom he sanctifies gouernthe and endeweth daily with eternal life, sight,
knowledge, and with his rightwisnes. These the very proper workis and benefits
of christ / the aungel calls the confirmacion of his covenant / even the fre
forthgeuing of his so plentuouse promises which were made to the fathers and
prophetis as says Jeremy. 31. Behold ye dais shall come and I shall smite up
a new covenant with the house of Israel: I shall give my law into their hertes
and be their god etc. Here let every godly reader remember and by faith set
hold upon this sweet covenant and promise of god in christ aknowleging with
thankis these so rich and confortable benefits / even the delyuerance from sin
death and hell / and the remission of sinnis in crystis blood with life
eternal given us in christ for his deaths sake.

In the middis of this last hebdom. I shall cease host oblacions sacrifices
and all rytis and cere of the jews. Oh heuye prophecye. Oh most sorrowful and
lamentable voice to the jews and to us yet ignorant A sorrowful voice for ye
papystis.

the ears and shed innumerable innocentis blood then one lowsye tradicion^ or a
romissh ryte shuldbe taken from us. The jews received their cere. and rites of
god, approved of the prophetis and fathers a long time. And yet here be they
constantly decreed of his aungel and christ / and written of daniel to cease
and to be abolisshed for ever. If these rites and cere. of god is own making

with what face dare they come before criste / which dare institute and make us

all ritis cere. etc. were they never so decent and laudable. But as the jews
believe it not / and therefore hold they the^ still / even so believe you it not /
and therefore set you up s^ boldly and cruelly your Romissh dampnable ritis etc

Et super alampinnam vel portam obominationum vastator erit vel stabit. Text.


That is to say. And upon the winged cherubims / pinacles / and gatis of the
abominacions shall be setvp abominable destruccions. Why? Dare the angel call
the holy wingis of the cherubims, and pinacles, phanes and doors of the holy
temple / abominacions? yea trwly for aftir he had abolisshed his ritis and
sacrifices there in, by crystis death and yet would the jews contrary to his will
use them there still / he abhorred all their leuitik ministracion in it. And
therefore he permitted pylate to procure the sign of their present abominable
destruction to be setvp (and that not wtoute the bisshops great siewt) on every
phane pinnacle and port of the temple / yea and upon the most holy (as ye
would say) high altar as upon the wings of ye cherubims over ye arc of
gods testament Caligula did setvp his image. But what was this abominable sign
of their destruction? verily a golden splayde egle even the emperors arms of
Rome with their own images even yt present token of the wrath of god /
signifyinge the Romans to come shortly / and miserably to destroy temple and
city with all their common we all unless they repented and enbraced christ. In
every place, pinnacle, phane and upon every gate (as ye se images and pictures
in our chirches even the abominable signs of a like destruction) had they set
up the baners of Tyberius and images of Caligule the emperors, which only
were not the signs of these abominable destruccions / but also all the false
worshipping is against crystis precepts were the same signs to. But wherefore did
Pilate and the bishops procure them these abominable baners and images? verily
they knew that they had putt Christ to death unworthily as Pilate himself
confessed it / wherefore they were afraid lest his innocent blood would be
anenged and required at their handis / and therefore to be defended / they (as
now do all siche like combrouse consciened clerkis and bishopes / by settinge
up of these their baners and images of the emperors and kings contend and
siewe to get their favor / but all was in vain. For under whose The
shameless shiftis and signs of our spirituals own de struccio^.
wingis they thought to have socour / even of the same wingis were they clean
wypt away and destroid: the spiritualtye thought to obtain the emperowrs and
Pylats favor by this meanis that they might with an evil ^^^scie^ce yet at
the lest wise defend and escape their murtheringe of christ and to co^tynew in
persecuting and slayinge his apostles banisshe their doctrine and hold still
their own sinful cerem* rytes and almaner idolatry / but it helped them not.
And have not our papistis set up thessame seculare wingis and images in their
chirches? have they not now made and set us up new articles of our faith
and underpropped them with the emperors sword and policy of ye realm? have
they not thrust in again all popish rytes / tradicions / sacraments / misses /
matens / diriges for their dead / processions / praying to posts / to stones /
holy water / salt / false inuocacions with an hole rablement of significatio^^
and signs of an ab ominable desolation? have they not put forth their
pestelent bokis of their own necessary doctrynes / articles and institucions
under the emperors and kingis wingis? Have they not tormented and combred many
a christian conscience with their forbidding the reding of the holy Bible
compelling men to their misses to receive and believe their sacraments to g^eue
grace / and men and women to live in perpetual burnings / and violently
deuorsinge lawfully married persons? yea they compel men to idolatry and
profane the lordis holy souper. The place of pra^yer and preching ye pollute
with idols and yet compel ye men thither come to knele down to crepe to kiss
and to pray. Now tell me by your faith defend ye not al these execrable
abominable signs of your own destruction? These these be ye very abominable
signs of your utter fa^^^ and desolacion which your selves have setvp in the
holy place and temple of menis hertis that should be the temples of god and also
in every church. Of these execrable abominacions christ said when ye see them
stand in the holy place / the^ take h^de and beware. For the heuey destruction
is at hand. Wherefore so suddenly fyl^ down all these abbeis? verily for because /
their abominable idolatry in Messes images pelgrimages shrynes and their
execrable supersticiouse rytes and cerem. and their chosen holiness in fylthey
vows and dampnable hypocrisye stood in ye place where they ought not to have
stonden. And therefore there droped down upon them so miserable a perpetual
destruction even the sign of godis heuey wrath. Et super alam. And yet upon
the wyng. Look therefore (my lordis) under whose wyngs and title ye yet
persecute and have shed so miche innocent blood / upon whom ye fa^^her your
actis / articles / enstruccions and institucions? For it follows.
Abominationes desolationum. That is / when ye see these execrable abominacions
kouered and defended with so mighty broad wyngis of the seculare arms / as
though there dirst noman say nor write / reas^n nor do / nor cyphre against them
/ then b^e ye sewer of a soden irreparable miserable destruction.

Et vsque ad cons^mmationem diffinitam still a bitira dei super vastitatem
pereuntem.

That is / upon these abominable destructiones or waastin^^e abominacions shall
ye wrath of god d^^pe down till all be utterly destroyed as it were with the
floude of the lordis indignacion. He compares this heuey desolacion to ye
d^lu^ye or universal floude of Nohe. For they shall be so utterly destroyed with
this Roman floude that few or none shall put up their headis as it were above
the waters to escape. Out of the Egypcia^e and Babylony^ floudis of captivity
the Iewe^ once escaped / but in this Roman diluu^e they all perisshed as did
pharao with his host in the muddie reed / or sedgie sea. And as the diluuye
drowned not the world in one day / but at last when the hyllis were
allkouered / allwere drowned even so did not the Romans at one assawte and
bataill destroy the jews but they we^^ vexed long and with many storms
slaughters besiegis sedicions / affliccio^s famyns / pestilences and
conspirisons by xxxv. years / and then in the end of the bataill when god had
thus / year byyere dropped down his wrath upon them / he powered forth as it
were the universal floude of his wrath upon them / even his vengeance / for
all the sheding of the just blood of the prophetis / of christ his own ^one /
and of the Apostles / to declare openly to the rest of the Jews and to us /
that he had sent his promised Messiah / which fulfyllinge the law concluded
our religion within the lymitis of faith and love / all the ceremonies of the
temple both sacred and carnal abrogated. And therefore aftir their kingdom and
preisthod were once anulled / it behow^ed not one stone upon another nor
vestigie of the temple to stand and remain.

Now therefore are we by this the jews miserable destruction taught and warned
/ that where so ever we se images / altars / misses / menis sacraments / rytes
/ cerem. tradicions / yea and menis actis and articles stand in the chirches /
red and preched out of the pulp its instede of the gospel / the sacraments of
god there profaned and abused of prodigiouse viciouse papistis and anticristis
/ there be ye certain to stand up the very signs of a like vengeance shortly
to be powered forth upon the same regions / cities and chirches. Fly ye
therefore now premonisshed out of siche regions and chirches as did the Apostles
at this prophecy of Gabriel out of Judea into Galile / lest ye perisshe of the
Turk as did the Jews / destroyed by Titus.

THese three last chapters hang so together that this. x. chap. may be called
the preface into the. 11. (1. 12. chap. In the which aftir the bataill of yt
good and bad angels for their provinces / there is treated a pronosticacion
showing meruelouse thingis from the third year of Cyrus unto the world is end
/ which thing is it profits miche the godly to know before they shall come.

In the third year of Cyrus king of Text.
the Persies / there was a certain verite showed unto Daniel called Beltsazar
/ and it was a verite concerning a great high matter / which thing he
perceived and understood right well by the wordis and vision. But in that time
I daniel was so heuey by three hebdomads of days that I ate no delicate meatis
and nether flesh nor wine came into my mouth / nether did I anoynte myself
with any oyntement 21. days
until these three hebdom. of days were ended.

Here daniel turns bak to the. 3. year of Cyrus / wherein ye see the heu^y
face of the church of god. For those so joyful tidings conceived by Cyrus
proclamacion of their return and buylding of their cite were now turned into
great sorrow and heaviness. For Cyrus perchance now gone far of to wage bataill
with the Scith^ans (his wyked sone Cambyses left in his stead) there went forth
from Cambyses a contrary commandment. That the jews should cease buylding
their temple and cite. Cyrus faught unhappily and was slain. Cambyses reigned.
6. or. 7. years. It chances in ye court to be many mutacions / good men be
there often excluded or else pressed with heythen supersticions. And wyked
rulers being ever enemies to the tr^we doctrine are called to ^ere rule. Daniel
now lamented the absence and fall of king Cyrus. He was syke and sorrowful to
se the name of god reviled / but greatly it grieved him to see the weakness and
peruersenes of the Jews / of whom many casted away all hope of yt restoringe
of their city and temple / thinking themselves to be seduced of the prophetis
and of Daniel to. They had now casten away gods promises / mother there were /
which although they did not utterly despeir yet they counseld their company not
to return / but tarry for a more tran quilite skorning them that were so
hastily When ye storye of Esther was done.
gone home before. In what an^^ sorrow and perels the Jews were from this time
till Darius Longi. begane to reign / which was. xl. years / the story of
Esther declares which was done in Darius Ahassuerus reign father to Darius
Longiman / and next king reigning aftir Cambysen Cyrus. Camby. Smerd.
and Smerdem / which both were enemies to the Jews and to their religion. Thus
aftir so ioyouse a begininge there followed a sorrowful success. Some of the
Ahassae. Darius Longim.
jews preferring their own ease and idleness above their religion / were wode
with indignacion distractinge the minds of other / and persuaded them to not
believe their prophetis / and thus they troubled daniel and other good men
minded to return. Siche is the fortune that abides the good pastors and true
prophetis.

Here have ye the image of the church whom god wills both to be exercised
and whetted with affliccions and also patiently to abide their delyuera^ce.
Nether shall our delyuerance come so to pass / nor by siche meanis a^ we
coniecter. For our delyuera^ce is decrede and governed of gods infallible
forsight / which noma^s gods infallible providence.
policy nor sword may nether let nor preuente / but it shall so come to
pass as god has decreed by his immutable providence. For all the impedimentis
by Cam^yses and other till Darius Longi. came, were so decreed of everlasting
of god. By this vision was daniel and other good men conforted in those
troublous times / and we be thereby also premonisshed of the present mutacions
of empyres and kingdoms and of like calamities and destruccions which draw
fast upon. Daniel was now nyer an. 100. years old / and syke for this said
sorrow.

In the. 24. day of the first month Text.
I was by the great ryuers side called Tygris. Tygris so called of his swiftnes.
And when I looked up / I saw a man in a whight linyne vesture whose loins
were gyrt up with glistering gold / whose body was beutifull like a violete or
iacinthe / his face like lyghteninge and his eyes like a burninge lamp / and
his arms and feet so bright as any polisshed steell and the voice of his
wordis as it were the vehement noise of a multitude.

Now daniel describes the time and place of this counfortable vision and also
yt face and estate of the person seen. For god would now conforte heuye daniel
/ and not only of the mutacio^s of the empyres to come / but also of the
calamities now preassinge upon the jews before crystis cominge / and make them
for this cause more certain: that thereof their posterite / and we might learn
with fear to call upon our zelouse God / and in faith wayt fore our savior
christ. This first month is Nisan / our Nisan march.
march / wherein they celebrated the memorial passover lomb in the remembrance
of their delyuera^ce out of Egypt The man whom he saw was crist / whom
hereaftir he calls Michael and the sone of man. A like descripcion is there
of him in the Apocal. 1. Whereof as some forms be terrible / so be some of his
parties pleasant and counfortable to behold as both the psalm. 44. and Isay.
11. describe him / teachinge us that christ according to his law and gospel /
is with his gospel ioconde and pleasant to all godly men / and terrible and
fearful with his law unto all ye ungodly. And therefore is he thus painted of
the prophetis. His sight to beholdeis ferefull to them that shall wisshe the
hills to fall upon them to cover them from his countenance. And mighty and
terrible is that same his voice and breath of his mouth which slays the
ungodly.

The rest of his body described is pleasant and ioyouse to behold to the
beleuers. His whight vesture and so* to be a man mortal thereby / signifies
him / as daniel hereaftir says / to be made whight with his cross and passion
/ to enter into his glory.

But I daniel alone saw this vision / and Text.
the men being with me did not see it / for they were smyten with so great
fear that they fled away and did hyde them. I therefore abiding there / alone
did se this great vision / but my strength was all gone fro me / and my beutie
and color was turned into deformite. All my strength was vanisshed away.

^o here ye see the wyked to not know christ / and therefore to fly from him
for fear: and yet he calls all men to him promising to refressh them and to
take all burdens and heuye fear from them. But the Mat. 11.
beleuers hear and come to him and tarry still with daniel by him / they see
him and be ^llumined of him / albeit at first whylis they be under the law /
they feel in themselves no strength to fulfill it / but they set hold by
faith upon crystis fulfylling chalengynge it for their own. To you therefore
(says christ) is it given to know these secret visions and mysteries / but
Mat. 13. Luke 8.
to other flyers away they be derke rydels and obscure parables.

Furthermore I hearing the voice Text.
of his wordis / as I had been oppressed with sleep / was casten down
groueling upon the earth. And lo / with his hand he touched me / lifting me
up yet creping on my knees and palms of my handis. And he said unto me: Daniel
which art so desyerouse of things to know them / take heed to the wordis
which I speak to the / and stond still in thy place / for now am I sent unto
the. And when he had told me this / I stood up trembling. But he said unto
me: Daniel / fear not. For in ye first day that thou applyedst thy mind to
understand and humbledst thyself before the god / thy wordis were herd / and
for thy sake am I comen. For the king of the Persies resisted me. 21. days.
But so / Mi chael one of the chief princes came and helped me / and I was there
left with ye kings of Persie. And am comen to the to tell ye what shall come
over thy people in ye later days. For this vision is extended and continued
into long and many tyms. And why les he thus spoke with me I cast down my face
towerd the grownde and spoke not. And so / one like the sone of man touched my
lips / and I opened my mouth and spoke saying to him that stood before me.
Sir / through this apparicion all my joints tremble / and my strength is gone
fro me. But how may the servant of this my lord speak with this which is my
lord? even now am I destitute of my strength / and I am so febled and faint
that I cannot take my breath. And then agene this man touching me counforted me
/ saying: Be not a frayd man so full of just desyers peace be with the / and
all fear set a part / be of good chere. And whylis he thus spoke with me / I
was well strengthened and cameayen to myself saying: Say on (my lord) for thou
have counforted me. And then he said: know thou not wherefore I am comen unto
the / and wherefore I must return* Now verily will I return to fight against
the prince of Persie. For the prince of the Grekis came thither as soon as I was
gone thence. But I shall tell the the trewthe to come as verily as it were
written / for there is none to help me in this matter against them / but
Michael your prince.

Daniel hearing this voice / and then thus The word of god hu^bleth the
hearers.
to fall down domme, ferefull, and breathles, signifies the power of gods
word to humble and cast down the hearers being never so good / and miche more
the adversaries thereof. For the sinful flesh hearing the justice of god
cannot / but tremble and fear / which thing Israel well figured when god
spoke the law to them But god would have siche hearers as was E^o. 19.

prince and leader of the Jews was the very Angels and not saites ar yt kepers

sone of God of whom says the psalm 113. Who is like the lord our god* And
albe it the angels be the serving spirits to ye chosen and most faithful

This is confirmed by the storye of Jacob saing that he was conducted in his

He is therefore call Christ is yt aungel of god emanuel. Iasay. 7

and pray to this owrpreseruer and defender Michael / that he would destroy
the workis of the devil. The offices of evil angels is to trouble and to set
king doms together by the ears / as ye see the^ to have done it even these
days by their impes the pope cardinals bisshops and prei stis in every realm
and in the empire / and to encense the ungodly against the chirches and word of
god / as here the text tells the prince of the persians to resist and to
fight against the good aungel. And when the good aungel was comen away then

spiritual power / as ye here see it. For the princes of the grekis and persies
were de uils stering up sedicions and persecucio^s in Greece and persie against
all godliness. In Persia the devil stered up young cambysem with his courtyers
and also Dari^^ Ahass^erum / inflamming them one aftir a another to destroy the
jews and daniel with all the religion of god / and in the same time in Greece
they stered up sedicion^ and batail. The grekis because they excelled in wi^e
and riches / the devil stered them up ayenste cambyses and were iwyse ouercome^
in Cyrus days and brought into an heavy seruitute and therefore they sediciously
resisted the Persies.

And this day the devil / in all the kingdoms realms and regions of the
world incenseth the ungodly against the gospel and to persecute the

word. For the same prince of the persies grekis and of all the world in all
ages and especially in this last age troubles vexes persecuteth and laboreth
to destroy the church of christ and all common wealis. Wherefore god suffers
the good angels often times to have the victory of the evil / that peace
might reign upon ye earth and the godly to have a breathinge time to rest
them. Whilis I came to the says the aungel / to tell the what is decrede to
come and written concerning the cross and persecucion to continue into so
long a time I did mine office to certifye the and all godly men warninge you
before of these persecucions that when they come ye fall not from the trwthe but
^^ther Joan. 16
to dye then to renye christ. And where the aungel says / he had faughten with
the prince devil of persye / and as soon as him self was comen thence / the
prince devil of the grekis to come thither to make trouble: he shewth that god
by angels defends both kingdoms and chirches: so that althings be so long
salf / as they be of good angels defended from the evil let us here be
counforted with these worcester dis. That the everlasting word and sone of god with
his angels be evermore present with his church in all our afflic cions and
persecucions to help us / to thrust away the devil with all his impes yet
persecutinge and to destroy his workis / let us patiently tarry for his help
against these deuyllysshe ungodly persons runninge and roringe in every place
enforceing with the Turkis and anticrystis power to skater and destroy Christis
church. yea ye prince of this world flies upon us with a more present
destruction and crueller armore / even with the negligence and tyranny of
emperor and kingis / and blody bisshops which should defend and noureshe
chirches. He assauteth us with mischeuous wylye wits and subtyle sophisters
and popis lawers incensed of the serpentine satan to sow and confirm false
doctrynes and deuyllyssh opinions. But he which with his angel crist kouered
his people in the reed sedgie sea and in the wilderness / he that defended Iosue
/ Gedeon / Samuel / David with all his faithful people / and as Jacob said /
the angel which has delivered me out of all perels / might bless and
defend us these his children. Let us remember that god has given us his
angels and christ also in commandment to keep us in all our ways / for the
angel of the lord bulworketh rownd about them that fear him and delyuereth
them. Since god sends his angels to keep his church / let us the less fear
the perels of our bodies / or any pouertye whiles we justly apply our
callings. This miche be said into the two chap. folowinge. Now to the kingdoms
in which the angel prophecieth the persecucions of the Jews to drawnigh and
to come over them in ye. 62. hebdom. before christ the savior be borne and also
of the persecucions which shall continue from the birth of christ and
destruction of Jerusalem / and vex us the gentilis to the worldis end.

IN this chap. the angel reherceth The argument of the. 11. chap.
the kings under whom the Jews should be vexed and persecuted unto the coming
of christ during yet the. 62. heb dom. that is in the. 434. years folowinge. For
God would confirm daniels faith / and premonisshe his posterite of the euyls
to come. Let these therefore be examples ^etforth / not only for all kingis /
that in the fear of god and for the love of christ they might learn to avoid
the horrible and terrible plagis of their ungodliness / but these examples be
also prescribed to the church that we might be taught under all emperors and
kings to bear the cross. For as the Jews under these kings suffered many
persecucio^s and vexacions till christ came / even so must ye crystians under
all turkisshe emperors / kings and anticrysten popis bear the cross until
the last day. In this our time full few are there siche favorers / patron^^
nources and defenders of good letters and holy scriptures as were Alexander the
great and Ptolomeus Philadelphus / there are so many Antiochis ye burners of
good bokis and sleyers of holy sayntis. Alexander carried ever about ye poet
homer with him / and faught ever so happily / but not for christ. Would god there
were now but one Iosi^s or Ezechias / which would karye David and Moses about
with him / that he might for crystis sake (as happily as did Alexander) fight
in these troubles days the just batails for the defense of the gospel against
these turkish anticristis. God stere us up a another Philadelphus which would
gather to gyther all these so great and holy learned m^nis bokis of late
printed / and lay them in lybraries and not burn them. Let us hear the
angel yet spekinge with Daniel.

For I trewly was from the first year Text.
of Darius the Mede present by him to Chap. ^
help and strengthen him. And now shall I tell the trewly what is to come.
Behold there be yet standinge in Persie. 3. kings / and the fowrth shall be the
rychest of them all / which thereby boldened and holding his riches / shall
stete up all his princes against the kingdom of the Grekis.

The angel spekinge before in the.9. chap. of the.70. hebd. remembered the
hard time, to which space / he gave the first 7. hebd. wherein with so great
difficulty the cite and temple were builded. In the x. chap. he expressed yet
the difficulty largelyer shewinge the bataill of the good angel against the
baddein all these.49. years / wherein the buyldinge was so long let and at
last absolved. Now he tells how many kings stood in Persie in these 7. hebd.
He says / they stood / for that they flourisshed and appeared to themselves to
stand fast for ever / never to be conquired. The first was king Cyrus / the.2.
Cambyses: the.3. Smerdes one of the Magis. Cyrus.

conclusion against the Grekis which for their wittis and riches were also the
more animated to fight ayenste the Persians / both their evil princes / that
is / their evil angels there unto so incensing them. But yet shall ye note it
/ that Ah^ssuerus himself prosecuted not this war / but left it to be
faughten with his son xerxes / which waging bataill with the Grekis (his
father xerxes and Darius Congim. brethern
dead) left his brother Darius Congiman to reign in Persie / which Darius

up and finissh the city and temple. And from the. 32. year of this Darius the
younger brother to xerxes to the begyning of the Roman Monarchee (I judge) that
we must give the second divided part of the hebd. that is the. 62. hebd. which
reche just unto the first emprour and counsull Julius Caesar even to. 47. years
before crystis birth / for the angel (as it appears by the tellinge and
diuydinge of the nowmbers / and by the process in ye text / had ever rather a
respect to the beginnings / order / and end of the. 4. Monarchies and
especially to those. 3. Monarchies 7. hebd. and 62 heb. distributed.
following / and to the affliccion of his church under the said imperies / then
to the continuance and lynking to gyther of the nowmbers one immediately to
follow the the other. For he says (aftir he had distributed the first. 7. heb. to
the buylding) distinctly and severally in the next verse (not repeting the
former. 7. hebd.)

And aftir. 62. hebdomadis christ shall be slain.

Now is it manifest / that aftir none of all these last and learned menis
account (if they follow the wordis of the text and not repete the former. 7.
hebdom.) can the nowmbere be continewed immediately / but must be broken as the
angel breketh and divides them. So that this is ye sense and mind of him.
That aftir. 62. hebd. where the prophecy of Jacob shall be fulfilled /
concerning the scepter of Judah to be taken away and the Romans to rule the
jews / then shall christ be borne and slain etc. but Jacob says not
immediately aftir ye scepter be taken away / no more then the angel says here
immediately aftir the. 62. heb. christ shall be slain / for it was (I say) 47.
years aftir / and aftir these. 47 years / yet. 33. aftir ere he was slain.
This miche have I learned sense by the expending and waying of the text and
process thereof / so that if (as Cicero says) our later cogitacions be wyser
then the former / let the readers be iuges.

Now to the text / xerxes prosecutinge Read Iu ^ inu^. l. 2

describes the flourishing encreace and destruction of great Alexander: For

For Alexander himself thought to destroy Jerusalem / but the high bishop

The verifying of these prophecies declare them to be spoken of god which only
as present foreseeth althinges to come And where he promises us delyuerance /
he shows himself to tender us that enbrace his prophecies. The godly
therefore are confirmed left they fall bak from their profession. But the last
part of this chap. perteyneth to the last part of this Monarchy and to this
age of the world declaring what persecucion cristis church has and shall yet
suffer under the cruel seculare and spiritual anticristis and at last under
the turk Mahumete / the spi ritualtye yet lordely reigning a^tir a profane

light of the gospel / of the trwe inuocacion in faith and confidence in the
sone of God / defending by their seculare arms idolatry, fighting burning and
fageting for their idols and for their prodigiouse lecherouse lustis / slayinge
innocents for the trwe doctrine. For unto their spiritual tyranny ye seculare
emperor and princes add their furiouse merciles blod sheding, both by
persecucion of the gospel and by batails, whose pride and riches be the sp^rres
unto all this tumult where in good studies and letters / gospel and christ

encreace his church. And if there be any prices which may heal these woundis /
let the^ now do their office / lest christ in his last judgment now at hand
accuse them gilty dampnanacion. Now should emperowr and princes setforth the
bible and defend good prechers. Now should the christian learned men be sought out
to teache crystes word of salvation. Now it behooves princes to defend the
gospel of christ teching peace and not banissh and burn the word of peace
commanding the trwe faithful prechers to silence and restraining the scriptures
and godly bokis forboden of them to be read of the christian good people so de

unto this day upon like Alexanders in a perpetual pathe to be verified upon
all the christian empires and kingdom which have so blasphemosly persecuted and
quenched the word of their salvation so mercilesly sheding the innocent blood
for the Gospel. Some kingdo^s have felt the stroke of this word and moo be
lykely to feel the cha^gys of their kings stock. Let al other bewar^ of like
heuey mutacions inminent: the bore is now opened / shut it if ye can. God had
endewed mighty Alexander with great and clear giftis. It was a great
beutyfull glory to him / in that he was feared and sought to of all other
kings / endewed Alexanders giftis.

many heuey chances and perels of his own subiectis. He was also of natute
very strong / hardy / and in counsel he passed the wysest / he could judge and
foresee what was ever for the best / he was prudent / comely / princely /
affable ientle / and amiable / he loved justice and punisshed the malefactors.
No prince like him in vertewe morals so long as he was in a right mind. But he
aknowleged not god to be the auctor of them. And therefore of pride and wealynes
gave himself up unto his own lustis as to eating and drinking delicately and
immoderately and unto voluptuosnes of his body to be pampered up to satisfye
his lybidinose flesh. And being dronken / he sl^we his most entyre and
necessary frendis / and was most cruel against them / which did him most
faithful service. Then he polluted himself with lecherye unto these foul
crimes he added contumelyes and cruelty against god / he believed himself to have
a certain divine prerogative and power above all men and god to (as would yet
some pestelent flateringe friars and prelates put it into emprours and kings

Alexander reigned.7. yearis after he had slain Darius the last king of the
Medis and Persies. And then the Greek Monarchy sustained great batails
trouble and slaughters and was torn and rent (as has the text) into many and
sondre dominions of strange kings / Alexanders posterite elene extinct. Then
there arose blodye batails betwixt the kingis of Asia and Syria and Egypt all

ouerrunne and depopulated of both ye hosts / now of the Egypcians and then of
ye Assyrians and Grekis. Alexanders kingdom / aftir his death was broken and

These examples I reherche / that siche punisshments might warn princes and
move them to modesty and to fear god. Remember that christ said: Without me
can ye do nothing. Amend therefore your lives and be merciful to the poor
innocents / or else look for no fauore / but for the vengeance of God to be
powered forth shortly upon you. Darius Longiman raigninge at Babylon / whylis
his brother xerxes faught in Europa against ye Grekis / gave license and
commandment to the Jews to return and finisshe their city and temple. (For
it apereth Esdras and Nehemias to be of his chief counsel) And therefore his
fortune agreed with his vertew. For God defended that modeste and beneficial
king unto his church / helping him in his gouerna^ce and defense of his
realm. Let emperors and kings follow this godly kingis fact in reedifying
gods cite and temple / which is his church by settinge forth true prechers
and teachers to reedifye the walls of Jerusalem. The text Psalm. 51.

This southe king one of Alexanders chief capitains or dukes brought up of a
poor soldyer / was called Ptolomeus the great and also Ptolom. Sotir / that is
a great savior / but yet all Syria / suffered all things contrary to his
name. For this Ptolomeus the son of Lagi governed Egypt which was sowth fro
the Jews / and was a mighty king and vexid sore ye Syrians and Jews. For
under a fraudelent color to sacrifice he entered into Jerusalem upon a saboth
day and cruelly dealt he with ye Jews leading away many thousands captiued*
Pausanias tells that he left aftir him sons / Philadelph / Ceraunion and
other. Polybius affirms him to have dyed almost. 40. years aftir Alexander.

This king was the north king Seleucus Seleucus Nicanor Macedo king of Syrie.
Nicanor of Macedo the son of one duke Philip / which was not therefore called
here so mighty in dominion over so great an empire because that aftir ye death
of Perdyk the gouerner of Babylon and because he overcame Antigonum fightinge

policy and strength shall not long endure / nether shall her ^ead oryssewe
stand / but both she and they that brought her thirther / her son / her
parent and housbonde shall be all betrayed and destroid in short speace.

Here ye see the unhappy chances that follow the humane policy of them that
persecute gods people / albeit their counsel and policy appear never so godly
before men. What might seem more godly then by marriage and affinite to confir
me concord and to make peace and friend ship? Bernice the daughter of
Philadelphi king of Egypt was given to Antiocho theos king of Syrie to make
the peace For these two kings had been long at war / and Ptolo. Philadelp
had lost certain cities in Syria / which cities he thought by this gift of
his daughter / at length to recover. But all was in vain. For this Antiochus
repudiated his own wife called Laodice mother to Seleuco callinico and to
Antioche hierax / and married Bernicen. Which marriage and repudiacion or divorce
from his first wife was the occasion of great mischief and murder. For
Seleucus Callinicus at ye persuasion of his mother Laodice slew^ Bernicen his
stepe mother with her young son / which murder was the occasion of many a
blody bataill as ye shall see here aftir. This Ptolomeus Philadel* was he that
instaured the lybrary in Alexandria / hyeringe the. lxx. interpreters to
translate the. v. bokis of Moses out of Hebrew into Greek. This prophecy was
not only spoken of those kingis / but also of other folowinge them. It is not
long agoo sense some kings gave their daugh ters to foreign kings in marriage
to conciliate amity / and what succeeded thereof? they never sense agreed well.
Albeit Ptolom. Philadel. was a vaingloriouse viciose couetuose king / yet did
god use him as an instrument to serve his glory in steringe him up to cause his
scriptures to be translated and reserved for ever in lybraries. This Ptolom.
thought by this marriage of his daughter at length by her posterite to join
all the hole kingdom of ye north to his own realm of Egypt / and gave in
dowrye with Bernice the land of Iewrye. Antiochus took her and repudiated his
own former wife Caodice and used her as a concubyne. But at last she being
weary of that life / poisoned him for his labor and caused her sone Calli^icum
to slaye Bernic^n with her young sone / and did set Callinicum in his fathers
rome to be king of Syria / wherefore this humane policy and confederacion
stood not long / nether might Bernices sead enjoy the kingdom of Syria. Also
the men that brought her thither which should have defended her and her issewe
/ all were destroyed / and her housbonde to / which all should have been her
staff / parents and conforters.

And then shall there stand up a another Text.
of her stok to come into her place / which shall come with an host against the
king of the north.

This man was Bernices brother / now king of Egypt / called Ptolom. Euergetes
provoked to revenge his sisters and his n^uies deaths. He came with a great
power against Callinicu^ king of Syria. He shall come says the angel and
obtain many great cities of Syria / he took away miche tresure and images.
And therefore says the text.

And shall invade his strong cities Text.
and castles / and in them he doing great and clear victoryes and featis of
war shall obtain his purpose. And carye away captiued into Egypt their
gods / with their rulers and most dear and preciouse plate and jewels of gold
and silver. And for a few years shall he stand sewer at rest from the north
king.

This king of the south / Ptolom. Euergetes (his sisters death thus revenged)
returned suddenly home into Egypt / by ye reason of sedicions and vprores
wrought in his absence / so that at his return / he was compelled to make
peace and to take trewce with Seleuco / Callinico. And at this time / Euergetes
commanded Iewrye to pay him tribute / and was without war certain years at
rest from the Syrians. And therefore says the angel.

Aftir that the king of the southe Text.
shall have thus invaded Syriam / he shall return into his own land again
(for fere of sedicions there in.)

But Euergetes first obtaining ye chiefest and strongest holds of Syria did
chase Seleucum out of his fathers Philadelphis kingdom and place for kyllinge
his sister and took from him a great part of Asia / he robbed his tempels and
spoiled his land ere he returned. Now did Antiochus Hierax fight against his
brother Seleuco / which Hierax ouercomen and fleing into a wilderness was
slain. And Seleucus casten of his horse dyed. This was the miserable end of
these 2. wyked brethern not raigninge skant. 3. years. This story touches the
angel / because that betwixt these rauisshinge hulkis thus spoylinge and
slayinge each other / Judea lying in the mids among them was taxed pilled
and robbed unto the ba re bones. Text.

The two sons of Seleuci Callinici Antioch fights against Philopate^.
king of Syrie / which sons were Seleucus Ceraunius and Antiochus the great
thus set on fire / came with this so great an host against Ptolomeum Philopatrem
the king of Egypt. This one of them here mentioned was Antiochus ye great
and air of the hole kingdom of Syria aftir that he had ouercomen Milo. For his
brother Ceraunius betrayed in Asia / dyed in ye time of this bataill. Antiochus
therefore coming with so great an host recovered and oppressed many cities in
Egypt and in Phenicia which were subject to ye Egypcio^s. Here he came upon
him / that is upon Ptolom Philopater king of Egypt like a floude (and as
Polybius writes describinge the begininge of the gestis of Antiocho) with three
score thousand fotemen and. 6000. horsemen brought unto Raphia^ the king of
Egyptis most strong city / where ayenste him he pitched his tentis / where the
bataill faughten / Antiochus had the victory and rekouered his former lost
cities. And here were the Jews compelled to change their lords and gouerners
/ in which mutacion what vex acions and how great losses and affliccions they
suffered / ye may well coniecter For whose heuye cause and persecucion^ to be
known / the angel thus prophecieth. But how Ptolom. Philopater with might
and strength repelleth this violence / it follows.

Then the south king shall be prouo Text.
ked with anger / and shall led forth his host Philopa against Antioc.
to fight against ye north king which shall bring forth in bataill an infinite
great multitude which multitude shall be delivered into the sowth kingis handis
/ which karyinge away this multitude / shall be elevated with a proud heart /
because he has throne down and gotten so many thousandis. But this victory
shall not long stand fast.

Now is the bataill treated which Ptosomeus Philopater king of Egypt faught
against Antioche ye great. Philopater was wealy and prowed and anon angered and
sone moved to war / here he has ye victory of Antiochus / and therefore was
his heart so puffed up / that he had throne down so innumerable an host and
recovered his lost cities / for now he thought to take his case in all idle
lustis at home. Iusti nus writes. That Philopater might have deprived
Antiochus of his kingdom now / if his vertewe had holyen his fortune. Sed
vincere scis Hannibal / vti victoria nescis. Oh Hannibal / thou know how to
have victories / but how to use and keep thy victories thou know it not.
Justinius in his. 29. book / says Ptolome to be to named Philopater of a
contrary fact / for that his father and mother flay ne / he got Egypt.
Wherefore an evil tree must bringforth evil frutis. For Phi lopater returned
home / slew his own wife Euridice which was his own sister all the nightis
continually was he given to whordom and the days to banketing. He permitted
his man concubyne Agathoclern / and his woman concubine Agathocleam to rule
Egypt / oh what manner a ruler had then miserable Judea? But this his victory
stood not long sewer and fast. For he lived not long aftir but had a miserable
end. By his life he caused ye Jews to be rent of elephants. In these days
were the Jews grievously afflicted and scourged. For first they had joined
themselves with Antiocho ye great. Aftir that / were they taxed and mulcted of
the Egypcio^s / and they that were then in Egypt were cruelly handled. Text.


For the king of the north shall yet come again upon him bringing forth a
greter host then before / and aftir a few years shall he come against him with
a migh ty great company strongly provided with great riches.

This is the prophecy of a new bataill by Antiochus the great against Ptolom.
Epiphanem / the son of Philopater now dead. For a non aftir / Philopater
being dead / and his very young prince Ptolom. Epiphane left behind him /
Antiochus moves bataill agenayenst Egypt. But here was Antiochus commanded of
the senators of rome which had taken ye tuicion of ye young prince to let Egypt
a lone. Which thing he heuely taking / joined himself confedered with
Hannibal and Philip king of Macedo: but yet was he ouercomen of the Romans /
and was com pelled to give over not only ye hole Asia unto the mount Taurns /
but also give in pledge to the Romans his sons Antioche Epiphanem and
Demetrium.

But in these days many shall resist Text.
and overcome the king of the south.

For albeit the Romans had taken the tuicion of the young fatherles prince of
Egypt / yet be these tutors oftin times ve ry slow. And therefore ceased not
Antiochus now confedered with Hannibal and Philip Macedo which sent ayed to
Antia chum to molest the young prince Ptolom. Epiphanem / and by the ways were
the Jews most grievously vexed both of the Syrians and also of the Egypcions.

suffer these sins of his people which said / I shall viset their iniquite etc.
Here he paynteth the wyked bisshops of the Jews which being both cruel and

Onias with many like bakfallers from god / fled into Egypt / where / in
Helioposi they builded them a temple and altares / and used there religion as
they were wont in Jerusalem / whom god had directely commanded to have but one
temple / one tabernacle / one altar / no where else to be any builded but in
the land of Canaan. For so knew God the consent of his doctrine to be the
beter kept. For he had decreed / from what place his voice should sown / be
heard / and carried over the hole world.

But yet shall the king of the north Text.
come and cast up bulwerkes about their cities and take his most strong towns
nether shall ye south arms stand against him / nor yet may his most strong
and chosen soldyers resist him. For he cominge thus upon him shall do his
lust / noman withstandinge him. He shall also invade and stand strong in that
most pleasant and desyered land which shall yield themsel^s into his handis.
Also Antiochus shall turn his face unto Egypt to get the hole realm. For
under the color of a peace making he shall give his most feyer daughter in
marriage to the young fatherles prince to destroy him / but it shall not so come
to pass / nether shall Antiochus have the south kingdom. Aftir this shall
Antiochus turn himself to the eyelondis and take many of them. But the prince
or counsull of the Romans shall compel him to cease with rebuke and shame so
that he shall not do this traitorous vilanye to the young prince of Egypt.
Wherefore Antiochus shall turn himself to the defenses or holds of his own
land / where he shall smite himself against an hard stone and fall never to
be fownde ayene.

The angel returns to Antiochus the great / yet again inuading Egypt there
to have gotten many of the young princes cities. Nether might the young chyldes
arms called Ptolom. Epiphanes resist him. Here were ye Jews vexed grievously
on both sydis. Here Judea is called the most pleasant desyered land / not
only because it flowed with milk and honey (as Moses says) but also because
that god did not so to any nation as he did to ye psalm. 147
Jews. Antiochus inuading Judea stood strong in it / when he did put Scoba
the young princes of Egypts deputy and captain with all his host out thereof to
flight. Which Scoba ouercomen / Antiochus made the Jews tributaries to him /
yilding themselves to antioche upon the condition to keep still their religion.
Aftir that Scoba was slain of Antiocho in Iewry / and the Jews brought under
his tribute / he makes yet a another viage into Egypt under the color to marye
his daughter Cleopatra to the young prince Ptolom. epiphane. The jews fained
themselves to be Antioches frendis and to receive him into Jerusalem. Albeit
they knew it / and were glad then / that the Romans prepared to resist him.
Nether was it but dissimulacion on Antiochus part. For he had decreed to diuyde
the tribes of Iewrye / part to be given with his fair daughter Cleopatra in
marriage to Ptolom. Epiphanes yet but a young child in a manner / Cleopatra filia
feminarum.
and the the other part to receive to himself into his own realm annexed. He
would mary his most goodly fayer daughter called filia feminaru^ / for her
excellent beuty (albeit the Hebreus use the same phrase for every woman) to the
southe young prince / that yet by siche means he might set in his foot to get
ye southe kingdom into his posterite / but it succeeded not. For aftir Antiochus
death there followed a great inclinacion and loss of the kingdom of Syria. He
feigned to go a plain way: but he intended deceit to the young prince / and
yet failed he of his purpose. For his daughter aftir she was married / queen
Cleopatra loved beter her king and spouse Ptolom. Epiphanes / then her father
Antiochus in this case / and not to destroy her housbonde that ye realm might
come into her fathers handis. This day likewise had leyfer the spiritualtye

power over princes to do what they list / as they were wo^t to do / but it shall
not succeed. Religio enim peperit diuitias / and filia deuorauit matrem. for
religon brought forth riches and the daughter has devoured her mother. Then
Antiochus turns his face to the eylandis sailing into Greece / there to fight
against the Romans / where by Hannibalis and other menis help he got Rhodes
and other cities to help him against Attilius
the Romans. But the consul of Rome resisted him and did put him to a
shameful rebuke and made him to cease and to be content with Syria / and to
yield Asiam to the Romans / with the charges of the bataill and to render to
them the ships Liuius decade 4
the captiued / and all that flede to him. Wherefore (says the angel) he
shall return home with shame / he shall be smy^^n against the rock and be alto
broken in Antioch ye great slain of hi^owne subjects.
his own fall. For now Antiochus returned into Syria^ / for very poverty
robbed a rich temple of Jupiter dyndyme^ where / of his own people he was
wretchedly slain. This was the end of Antiochus the great which living would
never cease from war and yet faught he ever unhappily. For the dukes of young
Ptolom* perceived his fraudelent intent in giving his daughter in marriage / and
therefore got they the Romans to be the princes defenders for that time. It is
therefore the destruction of many realms to move batail not necessary nor
justly / namely fortune frowninge upon them. And therefore this it is that the
angel says in the end: He shall turn himself to the help and defenses or
holds of his own land in Sy ria etc. For in this his shameful flight from
the Romans with so great loss and rebuke / he for need robbinge the temple
was miserably slain of the common people.

In this king is described and figured Anticryste to reign both in the

sort in these last days unto the worlds end Let us therefore behold the
begininge / the success / and end of this anticrysten Antiochus / which to
come to the kingdom / slew his own brother Seleucus as did Jason slay Onias
the bishop to obtain his bisshopryke. And have there not been like pagents
played emonge emprours / kings / popes preistis and bisshops / one to succeed
another? Antiochus his begininge was vile and co^temptible not looked for to be
king. For he was in presone at Rome left in pledge of his father / nether asked
of ye Sy tia^s nor lawfully called to be their king / for his elder brother
Seleucus had now a son alive to succeed him. The aungel therefore calls him
a contemptible or an vnestemed person / for that he wanted auctorite / that is
vertewe / felicite / unlooked fore of the people. But god did set him in
auctorite and place to be the instrument of his wrath. For whosoever shall well
tule and be obayed of his people / he must nedis have auctorite / which only
God creates / witness Solomon saing. An eye Prou. 20.
saying and ear hearing both be of God. Albeit therefore this antiochus was
subtyle and a bold waryer / yet because he wanted ye just auctorite before men
/ that is he was unjust / outrageous* cruel / viciou se / he was called of the
aungella co^tempned vile vnestemed wretch. He therefore what by deceitful
fraud / flaterye and fayer false promises / got the favor of ye romans to
defeat his brothers sone of the kingdom. But will ye see anticryst in his
proper colors? He shall come into his auctorite and place of himself unsent of
god / nether enters he in by the door / but lurketh a wolf vndera lambs

What glitering show of honesty / vertewe / godlynes and holiness shows and
pretends this horned beast? under how many holy prete^ces to suppress
heresies sedicions and to abolisshe false religions / yea to abolisshe
anticryst himself to refor me the chirches and plant the gospel playth he
anticrystis part in stablishing false doctrine and falser religion and in
suppressing the true gospel? under the color of preching the gospel purely
and syncerely / he burns and banisheth all tr^ sincere and pure prechers of
it. Has not Mahumete and the popes by these subtyle fraudis gotten their
kingdo^s? They promise to teache and declare the laws of god / but they preche
their own dead deuilishe dremes. They write themselves the most holy headis
and vicares of the catholic church of God / but they be the most profane
cheiftains of satan's synagoge. They pretend rightwysnes / and work all
mischief. They fayn peace / and be the autors of ye most unjust batails. They
praise and preche mercy and good workis / and be therselues the most cruel
merciless tyrants and sheders of innocent blood / spendinge the goodis of the
church and substance of the poor upon their own fleshly lustis and dirtye
doing sakes.

Three things be here expressed. First he is not called. Secondarily / it came
prosperously to pass with him to reign.

Thirdly he obtained all thingis by murder / fraud and flaterye. He was far
inferior to his father antiochus the great both in power and fortune. He was a
subtyle deceiuet / a fayer false promiser / a fla terer / a viciouse lecherouse
person / couetuose / graceles / bold in mischief and pie teles.

whelmed of him / yea and even ye prince him self which was confedered with him.

By these arysinge arms be signified the princes of Syria and Egypt / but
chiefly the capitains of the hosts holdinge and kepinge the cities in Phenice
/ which like a swelling sea came rising up against this Antiochus Epiphan. which
arms had then leauer either Seleucus his son the Syriam / or else Ptolom.
Philometor the Egypt prince and son of Cleopatre sister to this Antiochus to
have reigned then this contempned Antiochus Epiphan. This prince here
confedered with him was Ptolom. Philometer Cleopatras son and king of Egypt.
All these arms and princes (says the angel) shall this wiked Antiochus
ouerwhelme and ouerflowe them like the dil^^i^ of Nohe. Hither to has he
described the begininge of the reign of Antiochus Epiphan. now shall ye see
the middis of his reign / that is to ^eit / his. 3. expedicio^s or viages / of
ye which / one was into Phinicen / and the other two into Egypt against his
sisters son Ptolom. Philometor.

For after that / he shall make an i^sidiose Text.
confederacion with him / he shall come up and overcome him with a few folk.
Of Anti ochus first viage into Pheni ce / Tyro and Syria.


That is to say: Alb eit antiochus Epiphan. shall make a deceitful
confederacy with his neuey of Egypt / yet shall he invade Phenicen ye rychest
province that his neuye had. And for that this antiochus his auun^le was
naturally rauisshinge and wolueshe / and because of his prodigalite and
profusions of giftis / he might not spare other menis goodis / he took away
here and there the riches of other men / and the tresure of the temple / and
made sale of all things. But first he came craftily to his neuy to be
co^federed with him as an uncle to take the tuicion faynedly of his neuye / and
lest he should be suspected / he came with a little company into Egypt but under
this color he invaded Phenicen / robbed and spoiled the city of Tyrus the
most rich cite of all.

And he shall come fortunatly and take Text.
the most rich cities and plentuouse places of the region / and shall bring
to pass those things which nether his fathers nor grandefathers could not /
the proyes / the spoil and the stolen riches shall he skater among them / he
shall also imagine and invent gyles and frauds that at his awaited time he
might invade and take the strongest cities and holds.

This province where in he so happily took the most rich cytes was Phenice /
wherein were Tyrus and Sydon with other rich towns / which province was some
time belonging to the Syrians / but then was it the Egypcio^s and belonged to
his neuey Philometor. The tresures and riches of this province he carried away
and shatered them prodigally to make him frendis and to hyer soldyers. Here
may ye see how clearly god saw before and so certeynly told every thing to
come.

Then shall he extend his strengthes Text.
and mind ayenste the south king antiochus first viage into Egypt.
with a great and mighty host. And the southe king shall be provoked to make
bataill against him with also mighty an howge host / but yet shall he not
withstand him / forthei shall betraye him.

Now had antiochus that rich province of Phenice and made him friends with the
spoil. Wherefore he exalted with so lukkey a success and begininge / thought
to invade Egypt with a greter host then he invaded Phenicen. But hear the occa
ston of this war. His neuey was now but young and had two chief counselors /
called Ceneus and Eulaius which would nedis have again Phenicen with the cities
thus by fraud taken away of Antio chus. Whose counsel antiochus perceyning /
got this great host to invade Egypt rather to have all then to lose that at
he had gotten. And here antiochus studied how to corrupt his neuies cou^sellers
and dukes with money to obtain his purpose. The bataill was set betwixt
Pellusium and the mount Casium / where antiochus wan the field by cortuptinge
his neuies capitains with giftis / then he fay ued himself to come nyerer into
Egypt to his neuye and to take the tuicion of him / for that he was yet but
young and so by that deceit to obtain the hole land of Egypt And to bring
this his wyked fraud to pass he corrupted even them that sat at his table /
daniel saying.

And for because his own counsel Text.
familiare at his table shall be his destruction / antiochus shall procure a
great host and slaye very many.

Co thus was young Philometors host betrayed and he lost the said field by the
treason of his own counselors corrupted with antiochus deceitful giftis.

But the minds of both the kings Text.
shall be bente one to hurt and destroy the ^other. And at one and the same
table shall theispeke frauds and falshed. But yet it shall not succeed / for
the end of this matter is appointed unto another time.

Aftir this was antiochus received of his neuye into Egypt by ye counsel of
his dukis / and they sat familiarely at one table. Wherefore the one thought to
destroy the the other / for the auuncle thought by the color of his tuicion and
promise to defend his young neuye / at last to set him besydis his kingdom.
And his neuye again thought to give tribute to the Roman^ (which were then to
mighty for the^ both) to be defended of them and to destroy his auuncle and so
to bring all Syria part to him again and part to the Romans. But ye time
appointed of god was not yet come / that the Romans should conquire all the
world which was a little above an. 100. years aftir. The chances and mutacio^s
of kingdoms and kings are in the handis of god visitinge the wykednes of the
fathers into their. 3. and. 4. generacions. Nether falls there an hear from
the head without his will at the appointed time of his forsight which no king
/ nor prince / as he cannot prolong nor differ / so can nor may he not
prevent it. Thus ye se that through this feigned amite / Antiochus came into
Egypt / and his neuy destitute the faithful counsel of his own nobles
received him / but both of them intended deceit to other. As often times the
amities and feigned frenships of prin ces be but mere deceit one to destroy ye
the other / as it is seen this day.

Wherefore he shall return into his own land with great riches / and shall
Text.
set his heart against the holy covenant / Of Anti ochus first cominge to
Jerusalem.
where (his pleasure taken) he shall return into his own land.

That is to say: Antiochus shall leave behind him in Egypt his host and
capitains appointed under the said false pretense / to keep and defend his
neuyes chief cities / which spoiled of him taking away great riches / he
shall return into Syria^. But in his return he thought to rob the temple of
Jerusalem (here may ye se what a subtyle raueninge bear wolf was this
anticryst the very figure of owrs.) Now had he good hope to have had all Egypt
and Judea to. When he came to Jerusalem / there fownde he a ^helpe to serve him
of his own turn: even the bishop Jason a like blody wretch / which before
had slain his good bro there and bishop Onias to get his bishopryke. This Jason
received Antioc. reverently. And albeit as yet / he by this Iasons consent /
had not set up the idol in the temple (which the angel calls the holy
covenant) and so profaned it / yet by the bisshopes deceit and consent / he
carried away the tresures and many rich ornaments. And a great slaughter of
the citesens was made that resisted them / and he carried away the substances of
the rich men / as it is to see in the. 1. book of the Match. Now for asmiche as
the angel extends the prophecy of this book unto the end of the world.
Let all young princes beware of them that feign themselves to be their
protectours / and nyest Beware young princes.
of kynne. And let us behold whether there be now any spiritual Iasons
confedered and conspired with like anticrystes / to rob and spoil and slaye
the cry sten chirches / and to settvp idols / to confirm false worshipes in
them. Now there follows yet his second viage into egypt miche more mischeuouse.

But at the appointed time he shall Text.
^nuade again the south kingdom / but yet Of Anti ochus second coming into
Jerusalem.
shall not the last viage be like the first. For ye ships of Cyprie shall
come against him / and make him astonned. And then shall he return with great
indignacion and anger against the holy covenant / where upon (his pleasure
taken) he shall look about him / and join unto him the traitors of the holy
covenant.

That is to say: Aftir two years Philo meter his neuye espying more clearly
the frauds of his auuncle went unto Alexa^ driam unto Disconem his brother /
and obtained help of the Romans to recover his lost cities / and thus
accouraged of the Romans he expressed his auuncles syriake host and army
there left in his chief cities of Egypt / receiving his cities into his own
defense / asking help and aid of the Romans / wherefore now cried his auu^cle
open war against him returning a fresshe with a great army into the coo s^es
of Egypt. But this viage was not like the former / for it was in vain and his

cruel false purpose frustrated by Popilius the ambassador from Rome which
with his spear drew a circle about Antiochus there he stood / compessinge him
to give a plain answer ere he would suffer him once to stepe out thereof /

the angel says: The nauey of cyprie or cithin / which were the Roman
ships out of Italy. It follows. And he shall return with indignacion in a

up the image of Jupiter Olimpii in the tem ple / and forbode circumcision with
an open proclamacion / he brent the holy bokis of the law and prophetis / and
constituted sinful plays and all beastly haithen vigilies and stews to be
haunted in ye cite / drinkinge dronken in the honor of their goddis Bacchus and
^enus. He slew ye godly men which would not consent to his idols and image
service and to their heithen filthynes. He / by the bisshhops counsel left
there an army of men to defend all this idolatry and heithen viciouse abo

great and greuouse was the persecucion and destruction of ye jews common weall
and trwe religion by this anticryst thus coun seled and provoked by the
bisshops Jason and Menelaius the story of the Machabeis tell it. Now see
whether Popis and bisshops have not ensenced like Antioches unto the same

bisshops roaring in pulpits and courts. That men must in this cause obey ye
ordinary powrs we may not prevent their pleasures in settinge forth the pure

And if these pestelent persuasions will not serve / then dispute they with fire

paynt their whorish church with holy names of the spouse of christ / our holy

laudable ceremonies / and to have the preeminence and to sit above all emprours
and kings. And then they contend noman so haroy as to swerve from the
ordinary powers / see ye them never so openl^ sinful and ungodly criminose /
yet ^an they not so err (say they) as to receive or teach any erroniouse and
false doctrine / false worshipes or idolatrye. For their holy mother the
church cannot err. And they only have the holy gooste with his feathers
wings and tail t^. And it is a token of ^ good mind (say they) to wynke at
their manifest crimes and to mitigate their mischief with a mo derate
interpretacion / and to excuse their abominacions with the infirmities and

must be dissembled and looked on through our fingers / lest in the rebukinge and

steringe of errors and faults of ye clergy / discord may be inflammed and
kindled / many ruynes / many dilaceracions and divisions with other
inconveniences may follow (say they which will bring forth gre ter hurtis and
breed worser things. A man (say they) may not rebuke his old fathers for
every dotage and chyldish towche. Also they have made great apologies and sewer
defenses for themselves concerning these their magistrals moderacions /
toleracions and mitigacions to wynk at their wily wykednes / which yet forbyde
that the forms and ways taken of the rulers should not be moved nor troubled /
no not although they have right gre te faults. These these be also the wily
flaterers by whom many emprours and kings have been invited and trapped with
their holy flateringe tytles and induced by their wiked counsels and perrellons
persuasion into theirowne destruccions. But yet be there certain limits of
these their deceitful and subtle persuasions. For let us bear and suffer
their civil seruitute and heuey burdens / let us wynke at their imperial
proclamacions and lord dely commandments / and suffer their ma nifolde
negligence / yea and their open fa^ sehed and tyranny in iugeme^ts. And let
them for theirowne worthei blindness be still seduced of their blind bisshops
and flatering friars / let us bear the^ speaking and doing all for their
private profits and pleasurs taking away the peples bodies and substance: but
yet the glory of god and of his sone Jesus Christ must we prefer above al
humane policies profitis pleasures and precepts and not esteem the public
perverse concord in false religion against god and his anointed more then the
glory of god or owr own honors and lives. For whosoever deny me (says christ)
before men / I shall deny him before my father in heaven. And the apostles
comande the precept of god to be preferred above the common concord of sinful
men / and to obey god rather then men. And if any / yea were it an angel of
heaven / teach a another gospel then himself had preched says Paul / accursed
might he be.

Unto these saings let us add the judgment of god setforthe in this prophecy
even to approve the lesser part which obayth not the king / emprors nor their
bisshops in this behalf but condemn these mainteiners of the ungodly
religion / put into their headis of these bakslyden bisshops. Nether be they so

of louaine / kings acts and articles / and the most part with their old
holy mothers customs so semely so decent so laudable and cetera. which be yet
their present weak weapes and roten reedis / then let us hear the voice of
christ in his trwe techers and godly prechers / which in this present conflic
te confuteth their false doctrine so clearly with god is word / as is the
son / as it was seen of late in the disputacions at Auspurge / Spires /
Raynspurge and Basyle where the popis do^ish disputers Ec cius / Cocleus /
Pighius / Alphons / Bartholome Latimerus with all their dronke^ draffe saks were
with shame constrained to give place to the learned me^ of the princes of
germanye (were Eccius and pighius never so fumish) as ye see them confounded in
the books written against them of the learned answering to their calumpniouse
false lies. Whilis the kingdom of ye bisshops was thought to be the church of
god the^ was not the trwe church known but now have the disputacions and
books of the learned / and the folisshe answers of the papis^is declared the
difference. But many (says the aungel) shall be smite^ down with sword and fire
etc. This is every day verified in every realm crystened sense the gospel was
offered them. This little floke of Christ thus destroid apere to their
adversaries to have little or no help of the gospel and of god / nor yet any
counfort at all: but yet out of that little help that so little apereth to our
anticristis (which help is right great to us in the scriptures and promises
of god wri ten for our consolacion and help) we feel both inestimable
counfort and help eue^ in the middis of our affliccions and in ye death /
when the most part and papistis judge us to be forsaken of god and man / as
they iuged criste to be / when his father took his spirit into his handis and
the third day reaised him up agene. But many shall join themselves to us (says
the angel) deceitfully. Trowth it is / that there were then / and be now
many false brethren / especially False bakbygh ting brethren.
s^che as were fryres and mon kes strewed into many congregacions so me to be
curats which under the pretense of the gospel as long as it apered to
increase and was not forboden / by gredier begginge dissemblinge and flateringe
both deceived and betrayed many / and yet they scaunder and hurt under the
same color many a simple and good man. Many there be of these dissembling
deceyuers and preuey false ^rethern even mo then of the ^^wthe verily. But at
that time there we re many that feigned themselves to ^e the frendis of the
Machab^is / butall was to destroy them. As ye bishop Alc^mus joined himself
fraudelently to the host of ye godly against Antiochus / which by the same
deceyte slew many godly citezens of the Jews. And here is to be noted. That
aftir the return from Babylon unto Anti^ chus days / there were rulers and
princes of the stok of David over the Jews / but yet without the name of a
king / being nethelesse in a mean autorite as capitaines When ye bishops of the
Ie was beg^ to rule.
and leaders into bataill. Wherefore now begane the bisshops to buss^le and bear
rule both in the seculare power and pomp over the people and played the kings
about. 160. year before crystis birth / as they have and yet shall bear like
rule and govern both emprours and kings not long before crystis second coming
to judgment. A little before this destruction by Antioc. was Iannes their
capitain slain of Antiochus in the sege of Jericho. Aftir that they were
without a seclare goid. And the bisshops strove among themselves / one
kyllinge another / set a fire with desyer of honor / rule and ambicion /
corrupted with all manner mischief / so that they blottedout the law of God /
thrustinge in their own lordely tradicions / as they have done this day.
Which is an eiident token that the world is nyghe the end and cry ste shortly
to come to judgment.

But as when the very church was destitute the ordinary powrs and seculare
gouerners / that godly Matathia exhorted the less part to resist ye furiouse
king / even so now have we the holy spirit exhor ting us to resist with his
word their false doctrine and to tell both emprour and kings and bisshops.
That we ought rather to obey God then men. Here is it plain that ever shall the
emprours / princes / kings / bishops and the seculare sort be the most part
against crystis trw church. Also as then did Alcimus the bishop associate
himself deceytfully with fraud unto the little flok of the godly into the
destruction of many good men / even so do the false brethern and falser
anointed bisshops and popish preistis this day. And many which never were of
us / shall (as Joan says) forsake and go from us to ye contrary part. For in
the time of persecucion Luke 2.
the thoughtis of many false holowe hertis shall be reveled and laid open / then
shall men be tried as it were with fire. And many shall turn their minds /
some for fear of loss of their goodis and syues / some for the displesure of
ye powrs / and some for dignities and lucre shall renye the verite and full bak
from the faith and become cruel persecutors. Which when they should have been
tried with fire to be made whyght / they became very blak Belialis / when by
the same cross and fire ye learned godly techers be tried / polisshed and made
as whyght as silver for a certain time appointed of god / aftir which time there
shall be a another world The time of our persecucion shall not long endure. Here
is lo / our consolacion for albeit our adversaries think us to be vttterly
forsaken and that our persecucion shall ever last / yet has god appointed us a
time of our rest and delyuera^ce / wherein we shall rejoice. And as ye jews
at that time were counforted with ye hope of crystis coming then at hand little
more then an C. years to come / even so be we now conforted with crystis coming
to judgment which we trust shall not so long tarry to deliver us and to cast
down ours and his enemies into perpetual pains. Which shall for his chosen
sakis shorten the days of this sinful world. Of the hole story of this
Antiochus Epiphanes / read the book of the Machabeis.

himself above all the goddis or above the most high god. And against ye most
high god over all shall he speak horrible blasphemies. And it shall prosper
well with him / until gods wrath be consumed upon him / and the impiete of the
wyked be at the rypest.

This is the lively descripcion (under the person of Antioc.) of our two
cruel anticrystes: that is to writ / of the Saracenik fyerce beast the Turk /
and of his blody brother our holy horned hypocrite the Roman Pope. Whom by
their bitter fruits ye may know as the tree by her sower crab. First by the
contempt of goddis almighty word. For where the angel says: That this king
shall do what himself list / and satisfye without any re^raint or restraint his
own lusts and pleasures: he signifies the turk and the pope with their
coniured horns to be lawless / nether to goddis word nor to their own laws
to be subject: but all things that they list to be lawful. Hitherto
pertains this.4. verse of the.x. Psalm. This ungodly casts up his nose and
despises The.4. verse of ye. 10. psalm. aftir the Hebrew.
all other / in all his mischeuouse wyked cogitacions he sets naught by god
Not only the turk / Mahumete / the popis of Rome / their cardinale /
bisshopes / monkis / preistis and friars have played / and yet play this part /
but also all emprours / kings and princes / which ensen ced by their
serpe^tine persuasions / have and yet do persecute and suppress the gospel /
which (now the day of their merciful visitacion by the gospel offered them)
yet will they (the angel calls anticrist a king) do what they list / make
what proclamacio^s and articles of our faith they list / as does the emprour
this day in the nether parties of Germany strayghtly commanding no printer to
printe / nor book seller to sell any godly book to the edifying of crystis
church nether in dewche Latyne / French / English / Spanish nor in the
Italion speech.

Secondly he is described of his pride. He shall be extolled and thrust up
himself above and against the most high god: speking horrible and meruclouse
blasphemies ayenste him: Here was it prophesied. That Anticryste should not
only sit in 2. these. 2
the temple of god / but that he shall proudly lift up himself (as Paul
prophecieth it of this place taken) above every thing that is called god / but
also by his doctrine fighting plain against the gospel / contumeliousely skorne
god and christ / and accurse and excommunicate his church / as it stands in
the.10. Psalm. His mouth is full of malediccions.

We exhort therefore as many as we may for the glory of god / that they
separat themselves from this ungodly faccio^ both in judgment and will: as did
the Maccabeis exhort many to avoid the company of the counsels confedered with
Antiochus / we warn also the learned and prudent / which yet for the study and
zele of peace (as they would be seen) or for a certain singular precise
morosite / would apere to abhor and estiewe these new facions and soden
mutacions (as they call them) being alto ware / to wise and to charely
circumspecte in this their slake santering / lest their rasshnes (as they
pretex it) should confirm the enemies of the gospel / therefore decree they
thus to stand still / like idle idols / and in securite as it were afar of
loking upon and beholdinge the bront of the bataill / no handis putting forth
/ nor yet once (when they might) to help to any amendment or reformacion. But
the matter is to manifest and to far gone / as may easily be perceived of men
of clear judgment not being corrupt with any affeccions. The reasons and
obieccions of our adversaries soluted by Philip melanc.


But here they say / that in healing these evils and enormites / we do more
hurt then good / as to make tumultes sedicions and cause the people to rebel
ayenste the magistratis and the ordonarie powrs and thus give them the bridle
to all licen ciouse liberty. And by this example and occasion the curiose
persons shall trouble the trwe doctrine. We see (say they) the Anabaptists /
the Seruetis / the ca^panes the loites / georgia^s / dauides / and other
pestlences increase at your steringis. As when some of the hyders headis were
smiten of / other headis arose up of their blood. Even so these deceivers in
this or that one place repressed / yet shall there other as evil sectis arise
in other places say you. ye ask be what enterprices take the great men upon
themselves? with what discipline suffer they their manners to be ruled? How
diligent (I pray you) be they to nourish godly studies and scoles? Whother
translate they the church and abbey goodis? What think ye? Is not this
distraccion and division of princes now emonge themselves an infinite and
suffice^t evil? We se it (say they) that nether great nor small matters can
they with a common consent bring well to pass. At last they say / If now the
beginings of this strife be so perellouse / what shall chance (think ye) upon
owr posterite when there shall be less lerninge and then by the longer custom
the audacite of great men shall be the more confirmed? yet is there now in
princes some zele to godly doctrine. Siche a study and zele shall there not be
in their childern. Wherefore if ye will nedis have althings suddenly changed (say
they) ye shall encreace fiercenes and cruelty. These things they say against
us when we rebuke their errors ty rannye / and open mischief. And full great
sorows do these heuey sighthes bring upon their cauillacions solu ted.
us. Civil discordis ge^der infinite evils and perels. But yet is it an
unjust yea an ungodly towche to cast the cause of discord and licenciouse
rebellion upon ye peaceable gospel. For they that rebel and wilnot obey god
nor his trwthe / but defend their own lies and erroneose affecti^ against the
open verite / they (I say) by their sediciouse studies stere up these vprores.
Images and all false opinions must give place to the almighty voice of god.
These abominacions when they be defended pertinatly of the enemies of the
gospel / then their stifnecked pertinacie inflammeth discordis. And even these
be the common and worthy present plages of all christian realms now set on fire
with bataill. I think there was never a fayerer and goodlyer realm then was
Egipte constituted of Joseph / and yet did Moses sament it to be utterly
destroid for repugning gods message and withholding his people in bondage against
his will And miche more did Ieremye bewaeil and sorrow the destruction of
Jerusalem / the te^ ple and the jews common weall. Now con sider the time of
Antiochus the figure of owr anticristes / and thou see even the image of owr
present plages and calamities in the story of the Maccabe. Few or almost non /
was the number of the godly unto whom yet were there joined many vayn light /
false / and deceitful persons. The princes could not agree among themselves.
Their chief leader and defender of the godly died before the end of the batail
/ as now of late the chief mainteiners / writers / and prechers of the
gospel have been taken away. But yet shall the beter and lest part have the
victory. But what confusions and destruccio^s of the jews land folowd that
persecucio^? Trewly Matathias took not to him his weapens to the intent that
his neuei her canus should be a ^autor of the saduceis false doctrine / nor yet
that his childers chil dern should constitute their kingdom with mutual murt
her slaying so cruelly the ci tesens. Nether yet that their childers childern /
as were the The banes (brether ne among themselves) should with wiked wepens and
batail one kill a another troublinge the religion and bringinge in upon them the
Romans to profane their tem ple. For it is manifest that aftir the batail of
Antiochus Epi. the i^ws were gre uously plaged with the domestik tyranny of
the posterite of the Maccabes / wc were their bisshops and preistis. So that
evermore shall the new storms ouerwhel this did Philip write in an. 1543:
me the church. And albeit ye present state of our church apere yet to be
tolerable al though she wants not her trouble and present persecucions /
yet with in these fe we years there shall an heat be kindled in princes hertis /
and so ^y little and little / the succession of the times shall after the prin ces
minds / yea and even the minds of the learned shall be changed / and all / both
the seculare and ecclesiastik sort shall be distracted from the trwthe unto
reuenginge one another with war. And then Philips prophecy was fulfilled in
ye year folowi^g and so forth.
shall there be an harder seruitute of the church / and false doctrines shall
follow (This was verified the last and this ye re when the keisar did set
forth his wiked precepts and 32. articles of the Doctors of Louayne).

But let us obey the commandment of god not doutinge himself to govern our
iournei and course unto the end / and his wrath to be apeaced. And if men go
forth in their mischief persecutinge his word and church / there abides them
a^ heuey miserable destruction / as did fall upon ye jews. But this one thing
dare I promi se our superciliose arrogant Ariopagites that so long ^s they
thus persecute and think thereby to have their kingdom again in tranquilite and
peace / and so long as they suffer not the gospel to be preched fore fear of
commocion / but thus violently suppress it / that god shall plage them and all
cristendom with perpetual batail famyn and p^^^elence / whereof there shall fo
low mutacio^s of imperies and realms / great changes of every estate and
degree There arose in greece batail among themselves whereby their chief cities
were almost utterly destroid / as platea / Corcyra Athens / Sparta. It was
their appointed plage of god for their wiked ungodliness idolatry and ^echerie.
And the heuier and grenoser was their plage because they had not gods gospel
to counfort them and to deliver the beleuers. For it is the most great benefit
of Gods mercy to kindleforth the light of the gospel when siche heuei
mutacions and destruccio^s draw nighe / as many ensamples have showed it / and
even now doutlese there hang over all realms crystened great and soden heuey
changes. Wherefore that some congregacions might be sustained and conforted with
the trwe knowledge and very inuocacion / and their heuines mitigated god has
sent us his gospel as the most present help and consolacion in the mid des of
these miserable mutacions which if we repel / so cast we from us our coun
forte. It was not the gospel that brought the turk (I speak of present
examples) into hongarie and Oestenrik. Nether was it gods word that brought
the englishmen into Scotland and into France. It was not the gospel that
brought Martin van Rosse before Anwerpe and to spoil a great part of Brabant
/ it was not the gospel / that drowned Rome and selonde It was not the gospel
that brought the emprowr into so many evil chances in his wars aftir he
fled from ye counsels and did no good but dissembled with the Germans. It is
not the gospel that makes this universal derthe of vitaill and of all
things. It is not ye gospel that shall bring in the Turk upon us. It is not
the Gospel that now plageth all realms with war? It is not the gospel
that casts down abbeis and bisshopryks bringing them into this obprobrious
obloquie and co^tumelie. It is not the gospel that commits the christian
princes to gyther one to destroy other. But it is the very violent denyinge
and thrustinge away and persecucion thereof and of the true prechers. It is
their fyerce madness in idolatry and their making of new articles with all
your other synfulnes and abominacions that has and shall daily plage all
crystendom.

What (I pray you) profited it Hungary The cou^ sell of ye bishops of Hungary.
the sage counsels of their bisshopes and preistes with their impes to comma^de
the gospel not to be there preched nor received for fear of commocion and
dissension / and then we being at discord (said they) emonge our selves / a
great occasion is given to the Turk to invade the land? And as this was
their policy to avoid the Turk (yea rather to bring him in upon them in
deed) even so use and practice our emprour / kings and bishops now the same
wise policy lo / unto this day. But as it came to the Hungarions / and to
other realms / even so let the rest look for like mutacions and worthei
plages. Men ignorant of the gospel / what counfort / what help and
delyuerance have they in siche anxts? verily non at all: but by their humane
policy they think to be salfe. Sed vana salus hominis. but vayn Psalm. 59.
is the help and health looked for by manis policy / says the lord. It is
therefore the light of the gospel that brings consolacion in these
affliccio^s unto godly men / which though these themselves to be op pressed
with the most heuye seruitute / yet be they assewered / not to be utterly
destroyed / which by their prayers in faith mitigate these plages and put the
per^ll from the beleuers / for so great and present is their help as is their
faith constant. And therefore do ye superciliose high lokes of our papistis
err far out of the way / they be deceived and they deceive other / if they
think their own wits / opinions / counsels and policies to be the
infallible destined tables / and that allthinges must so come to pass as they
have decrede / and that from their set pur posed counsels and decrees / not god
himself may sw^rue. But harken / o ye foles Isa. 29.
what the spirit of truth tells you / saying. Because this people draws
nyghe me with their lyppes and with their mou these speak miche worship by me /
their her it is being so far fro me / and because the worship that they should
give me / they give it me aftir their own devise and aftir the doctrine and
precepts of men / therefore behold / I meself shall do to this people a thing to
be wondered at above mesure. I shall destroy the wysdom of their wise men / and
the understanding and forcasts of their men of most actiuite and policy
shall have a fall. Woe be to them that so depely drown themselves in their own
policy that they think to hyde their thoughts and counsels from the lord
etc. To whom speaks God here? not to our papistis think ye? We see it and
know it spoken unto them as our present daily examples teache us. Wherefore we
render unto God the eternal father of our delyuerer Jesus Christ high and
immortal thankis for that he has again kindled to us the light of his gospel.
Wherefore let us pray to god in faith and in innoce^cye of lyuinge and be not
afraid of the false iugeme^ts and falser persuasions of these preistis of Baal.
Let us enbra^e the gospel / love and reverence the very true church / let us
know the godly not to be called to slughisshnes and idleness / but unto the
most hardeste sharp and ieoperdest batails.

The tokens and markis of our anticrystis the markis of anticryst.
therefore must be well known. The devil diverse ways lays a wayt for all
men. Some he exalts into pride. Some he wrappeth into lecherouse lusts: some
he combreth in covetousness / murder / theft / destruccio^ of realms / rape
and into a false faith he brings many and blydeneth them with false opinions
and falser religions. Agenst this adversary it behooves to fight buisily / but
how and when / well know the godly. We must holdfast ye doctrine delivered us
of god. And in faith must me ask help of him only for crystis sake. Our
myndis must be confirmed with his promises / lest evil temptacions take us.
The devil has yet his instruments / even the pope / cardinals / bisshopes /
preistis and frye^s / about emprour and kings to water yet a fresshe the popes
gardens. And their father satan has yet other instruments / even the Epicures
which wryeth and wrest all religions unto their own profit and pleasures /
yea and even the gospel the abuse unto their own lucre taking it for a ieste
and story made by man: yea and even they that would seem to be the pillars and
edifiers of the church and defenders of the gospel / defend their misses /
images idolatry and seduce menis myndis from the trwe inuocacion and worship
of god. These menis kingdom is contained under the name of anticryst / and is
to be abhorred. Some simple sort are gretely deceived with this reverend name
of the holy mother and catholic church / which they give to the gay place and
proud preistis only. And therefore they think it impossible to be any knauerye
or errors in so holy fathers with their meretrik mother.

sone of god / and this their oblacion to deserve for other men (by the vertew
of the deed it self) grace / remission / and help against all bodily peress and
deceases. These fylthey lies and prodigiouse prophanacions of so holy a souper
have horribly kindled ye wrath of god. Ever has the church believed the workis
commanded of god to be the worshipinge of God and our duties wherein we please
God. Nether is god worshipped with rytes and cerem. invented of men be they
never so decent and laudable before men. Says not Luke 16.
Christ: Whatsoever is hyghely esteemed lauded and praised for decent and holy
before men / is abominable before god? For if these their decent rytes and
cerem. were godis worship and honor / so should the heithen rytes and cerem be
decent and laudable services and worshipinges of god. In this error the
anticrystis fayn the religion of monkis / friars etc. and the sole lyuinge of
preistis to be high service to god / and therefore forbid they all these orders
to marye / and they ^ende the lawful married in sonder most cruelly / when this
their deuilysh law of their wyueles chastity is the most cruel tyranny
bringinge many thousands to dampnacion / whose minds and bodies for this
unlawful bond are deadly polluted / whose souli^ by this one law be so
let that they never can rightly call upon god / and therefore by the common
consent of all godly men it ought to be abolisshed. These anticrystis Mark
this well
transform the church into a civil kingdom and into the policy of the
realm / tyering it with decent ciuilactis and rites / which apisshe imitacio^s
ar the cau se of all these errors and mischief brought into the chirches. They
attribute to Peter and to his successors (as they call themselves) powrto
translate kingdoms / and to the bisshops they give autorite to make new
articles of our faith. And themselves to give the same to emprour kings and
princes / as did Jason and Meri^laius to cruel Antiochus and to make new
worshipings and services to honor God. These bisshops usurp a seclare lordely
power to interpret scriptures / which to flater princes they give it also to
kings / ne noceant / to hold them to frendis / and yet is the trwe
interpretacion of the scriptures the gift of god / as is the institucion of
gods service and worship limited with his prescript word / and with no power
ge uen of men. And to be short. The lordlynes and dominacion of the bisshops /
is now all contrary to the gospel. And when we at the last counsel (the
emprour and the lord is of germany being present with all the learned) monished
iently these bisshops of these enormities yet will they most proudly and
pertinatly defend still their idolatry and open errors convicted there openly
of the same / yet forbid they the gospel of trwthe to be taught: and with
tyrany above any Nero or Dioclecia neslay they godly me^ for the profession of
the gospel. Their own partinate pride wetingly resistinge gods word therefore
declares them to be the very anticrystis here prophesied of daniel. Nether be
the controversies whereof we disputed / obscu^e / but were clearly then confuted
and percei ued of al men. The cause why so many dis sent from us is. That they
be epicures or hipocrites blyndened and bewitched with the false auctorite of
the pope and his car dinalls and bisshops or with the vayn co^ ceite of their
own carnal wisdom and policy / of which it is written in this cha. thus. All the ungodly shall be with out un derstanding. Wherefore let us not be moved at
their wiked iugements and ordina^ ces to consent to their errors and idolatrye
/ so to help their furyose madness. Now ye se anticristis kingdom and who be
the princes thereof / wherefore it is sone seen upon whom the text is verified.
Now to the text again whence I have digressed. Text.


And it shall prosper with him until Gods wrath be consumed and spent upon him
and ye impiety and wykednes of the ungodly be at the rypeste.

For the contempt of the gospel / shall the wrath of god suffer the turk and
the pope with strong delusions and effectuose errors to destroy many soulis

promises to the repenters remission of their sins and life eternal for the
only faith and confidence of his mercy promised them. The turk calls upon
Mahumete and will be justified by the workis co^man ded in Mahumets law / the
pope calls upon the dead saints and will be justified by the works written in
his own decrees and law. In this verse ye se two manifest marks of anticryst
printed both upon the turk and the pope and their seculare princes yet
following their stepis one evident mark is. They shall not know ne understand
what God is / but openly cast away the God of our fathers Abraham / Isaac

affliccions we and they did ever fly in the faith of christ our savior and
only mediator. And were hard and helped by his mercy / our faith teching it
unto crystis passion paste / as did theirs unto his death to come / there by
both they and we to be justified. But this our eternal god and father thus
known in Christ / shall our anticrystis (says the angel) never know nor
regard / but spyghtfully set him at naught and cast him away for their idols
setvp in his stead both in their own hertis and in their chirches to be
worshipped aftir their own inuencions / inuocacions etc. They shall invent
their new iustificacio^s new articles / remissions / indulgences and

hypocritish cloak of un lawful lawful vows and sole unchaste chastity. So
that by this deuillish doctrine and prohibicion many a man and woman 1. Tim. 4
is dishonested shamed viciated and polluted / yea and many a soull dampened.
Siche forbidders of wedlok shall never have good success and fortune in their
own maryages.

And as for our bisshops and preistis the autors of this anticrysten act /
they be so depely and so openly marked with this baudy bronde and popish print
/ that whosoever see their shaven crowns / as they be afraid of their family
wives and daugh ters and abhor their to ouermiche domestike familiarite / so
do all the world speak shame of their open prodigiose lechery. These be lo /
the monstrose marks of our anticrystis both seculare and ecclestastike / even
the manifest blasphemie^ and contempt of god in worshipping images and strange
gods and their deuillish doctrine prohibyting lawful marriage and violently
rendinge honest lawfully mared persons in sond^r with their derely beloved
children / thus to confirm their own wide wandering wyueles lecherous lusts.
I tremble and shake for very shame and fear to tell the horrible viciouse lives
and abominable fylthynes committed among themselves and with menis wives /
whereof all the romish rammish preistis and bisshops so stink that all honest
men stop their noses / ears and eyes at them.

This anticrysten kingdom reteyneth the name of god the eternal father and his
sone christ. But they add to idols and corruppe the true doctrine: both in
praying to the dead and worshipinge of idols and images / among ye which idols
their miss is the most execrable abominable sign of a swift and soden
destruction shortly to fall over them. And as for the true inuocacion of god
through christ / they have turned it into a dowtfull dubitacion. In our
sorrowful repentance and contricion / so long as the mind dowteth / and is not
certeynly persuaded of remission of her sins / ^he knowth not God in Christ /
but* flies from him to dead saints and dome idols. The crystians in this
manner of inuocacion differ not from the turks Saracens and jews / which al
pray to / and call upon god / but in a perpetual dubitacio^ whether god be
merciful / forgive or hear them. For nether they nor we can be certified by
our workis / whether we be for their sakis worthy to be herd and for given.
Wherefore our faith stayed upon god and upon his promises to be herd and
forgeuen for crystis sake whom the father willed to be offered up a sacrifice
for our sins / excludes almaner a doubt and all that may let or fight agenst
this merciable forgeuens. For this constant gift of faith certifieth us
fermely / verily to be received of our god and father for his sons sake / and
for his sake only our prayers Heb. 2. and 4.
to be herd / as it is written. We having siche a bishop and mediator / let us

with bold confidence go unto him and cet. And again / what soever ye ask my
father in my name / he will give it you. For in that he says in my name / he
comandeth a prayer
us to ask in the faith and confidence of the mediator. As thus. Oh eternal
god and father of our lord* Jesus christ / the maker and conseruer of althings
/ most wise / the ^este / merciful / our judge / and almighty / upon (...) ring
of either wothers beneuolent dewtie. The man knowth himself to owe certain
labors to his wife / that she want not food or any necessary thing / and the
woman mu^te labor to sustain the up bringing of her childerne etc. as that
mo^te fruitful and necessary book of the Christen state of matrimony techeth
us. Which book every christian man ought to read. But the one eyed great
tyrant king Cy Cy clops ye popes and his pri ces.
clops sitting alone in his de^ne ladig his bellye with dilicats and his own
flessh with lusts care not for this honest cure and coniugale love. He bears
no honest benevolence to any part of mankind he gives them not their
honest conjugal honor for their creators sake nor laboreth to get his wife
her living nor defen death her from inconveniences / but himself compresseth and
dishonesteth al other menis wives and daughters and turns up their halters
when he has done with them / for they will not be combred with their own wives
and childern. This is both the sclaunder to the woman iniurye to her housbond /
shame and dishonestie to them all* 3. and to their childern to / and destruc
cion of the frail sex / not to norish help and defend her but to bring her
into pertuall infamy and dampnacion. Of this injury shame and dishonestie
speaks the text saying he shall fill the women full of shame and dishonestye
sclau^dered with perpetual contumely and dampnacion.

ue all things. Here he describes the furye of the Epicures / which is the
highest and depest mischief of all impiete / even to co^tempne the very god and
to use him as no god / but to imagine god to be a god of his own making / and
to desiroie the predestinacion and forsight of god / yea to make the religions
or gods ordinances to serve his own plesures for his own profit and lucre.
Who destroieth gods infal lible providence and predestinacion but he that
decrees / that a man may prevent the predestined and appointed howr of his
death / infallibly foresene of god? What else is this then to be magnified above
god? To make new articles of owr faith contrary to Gods word / and to set them
in their profane seculare acts of politik parlements armed with sword and
fire / is not else then to be exalted above god himself. Wonder it is saying
this epi cury godles furye be so horrible a sin against gods high majesty /
that noman ^a^ express the grauite thereof / that so innumerable men so miche

This Anticristen kingdom says the text shall give great lordships and
kingdoms to many and deuyde the earth to them by permutacion. It is manifest /
that the popis have translated empires and kingdoms / permuting and chaunginge
them at their plesures which have defended the^ and their god Mayzim. For as
antiochus gave the bisshoprik of Jerusalem to the epicure preistis which gave
him license to profane and spoil the temple / even so now do the popes and
bisshopes give the same license to seculare emprours and kings that their
selfs might still make Mayzim / yea they have given great giftis and
promocions to Eccius / Cocleus / Emser / Pighius / Latomus / and Alpho^s and to
siche popish preistes and phariseis to write and to dispute strongly for Mayzim
against the lordis holy souper / and to defend idols and all false religion.
yea and albeit their misses / rytes with all their false religion be proved
openly naught and deuillissh / yet cloak they them with this pretext saying.
The autorite of the chir che may not be contempned nor spotted / nor their
decent odiouse orders and illaudable rytes be taken away which lordis must
nedis rule the roste. But (cryste^ rea der) take thou heed to gods word which
here clearly painteth before thyn eyes their god Mayzim with all his helpers
and defenders / and by whom and what means he is yet helped vpholden and defen
ded / and harken what yt voice of god says Fugite idola / fly from images and
idols and avoid false strange gods. Thou shall see it openly how the bisshops
shall short ly render up into the emprours and kings ha^dis their bisshopriks
autorite spiritual over the chirches / their first fruits their tenthes /
palaces parkes etc. and the pope shall yet give the^ the tytles of god / to
defend his false faith. Which all is not else then to exalte them above god /
and all to defend and magnifye their mo^stro se Mayzim.

But at last / the south king shall gore him with his horn and the north

Here is discribed the last bataill betwixt Antiochus and the king of Egypt.
But as christ took an occasion in the pro phecie of the foresignes and
destruction Mat. 24.
of Jerusalem / of the temple and jews co mon weal / to set before owr eyes
the fore signs and tokens of his last cominge and destruction of the world:
even so here of this last batail betwixt these two kin ges / the angel
proceeds unto this present last end of the world / declaring in how
troublouse and blody a state ye world shall make an end. Now the west par te
of the world which is called crystendom has her north and southe kings /
which be at heuey war among them selves. The pope is / and has been long
time a south king / and with his horns and power has he hurt all crystendom
north weste and east from him / he has given them all to drink of his
poisoned golden Apoc. 17.
cup / auerting them from the trwe faith and religion unto his anticristen
doctrine. And whether he has now set the north and southe kings and emprowr
together by the ears set the stories and present experience be judge. The text
says. At last / or in the time of the end / meaning not only the end of
Antiochus per secucion / but also this present time and end of this world. But
a^ there now no north este and weste kings which fight against the south
king the pope* yisse trw ly. All they which hane received the gospel as the
germans / and they that under the same pretense debar him of his false
usurped power and money falselyer exacted / as england / fight yet against him /
yea and all the christian learned which write or preach against him in Germany /
France / England etc. do yet fight ayenste him resistinge this strong and
sharp horned harnest hoar of Babylon. The text seems to give the victory to
the north kings ayenste the pope and him to have the fall: which shall be
verified of the spiritual bataill with the pens and lips of the learned and
godly me^ writing prechinge and praying against him. What shall we say of these
kings yet fighting among the^sel ues? God knowth. But ye turk is a north este
king if we look upon his seat emperial in Constantinople from Judea and from
us. Wherefore / I judge that for ye persecucio^ and thrusting away of ye gospel al
ye west real med and the Roman empire shall be thus settogither one to
destroy another til the way be made redye for the turks incursion. And that
therbe but few christian kin ges a live that shall leave their king do^s to
their own ayers and posterite if the tur ke prevail. For he shall come into
that most pleasant land greatly desyered and many shall be slain. This shall be
a perelous and a troubles time. Ezechiel prophesied of this destruction by Gog
and Magog / by whom is understood the turks cruel power. The pope first came
into Italy and did set his seat in Rome / which is the most pleasant land in
cristendom. France / England and diverse parties of Germany be right fertyle
and pleasant lands / and greatly desyered and longed for of ye turk. But who
shall escape these cruel anticristis handis? the text says thus.

But these men shall escape his hand / Text.

be the bloody Edomities of Esau Moabits signifye proud men / the Ammonites be
basterds and misbegoten / both were the sons of dronken lot gotten by his
own daughters. These blody misbegoten filthei papists shall be confedered with
the pope and turk / and with the per sewers and destroiers of the crystendom /
and so escape themselves / for that present time. These misbegoten Ammonites yt
pope and his misshapen bisshops shall diligently wait which part is like to
preuaise / and unto that part shall they fly with their riches and fayer
false persuasions submitting themselves even to the Turk rather then they
would lose their names / riches / tytles and dignities / and will rather become
Machumetes misshops and the turkis true priests then to dye for the Christian
faith. It follows in the next verse / who shall not escape.

And he shall send his power into Text.
regions / and the land of Egypt shall not escape. The pope and turk will
have the ry ches of Egypt.


Egypt was no less pleasant fertile and rich then it was blind and ignorant
of god and full of idolatrye. Egypt is asmiche to say as derkenes. The more
welthye and rich kingdoms be / the more vi^iouse blind and adversaries at
they to Gods word. There be yet some The pope has had the^ / the turk will
have them.
kingdoms rich pleasant and welthey / but in the middaye light of the gospel
now sprongen up so clearly more then these. 20. years / good lord how blind
and derke Egypts be they? But for their riches and welthynes shall the Turk
the ernestlyer be bent to invade and to obtain them. Wherefore it follows.

And he shall be king over the tresures Text.
of their gold and silver and lord over all their pleasant possessions and
jewels of these blind Egypcions. But Ly bya and India shall he pass through.

These blind wealy lands which yet persecute gods word shall not escape the
turkis handis. But Lybya and India by which are understood all dry baron
regions full of poverty lands full of mo^stres and wild beasts where nether
riches nor pleasures are to be gotten ye turk shall pass by or through them
doing no hurt. For they be riches tresures and pleasant fertile regions full
of gold and silver that anticryst ever sought and shall seek to the worldis
end. But now whyls they be in the middis of their welthe and riches and have
gotten these pleasant real mes / the angel thus says.

But then shall tidings from ye east Text.
and north trouble him and fear him.

When the pope was in the middis of his welthy riches and so high in power
auctorite and honor / dreaded and exalted above god through out all crystendom
encreasinge his riches and power with pardons licenses grauntes and gathering
of his tributes and pensions / then came there shrewed tydinges to him from the
north east out of Saxony and Hel^etia / that one Martine Luther with
zwinglius and Ecolampadius begane to write against his pardons and against his
god Mayzim / and that they disputed of his power etc. Then began the gospel
and good tidings of the iustificacion and fre pardon and remission of sins by
only faith in Jesus christ to be brought to his ears / which as they were good
and glad tydinges to the beleuers / so were they terrible tydinges and a
ferefull fame to all infidels and papists. For then as ye text says.

In ira and furore magno egredietur Text.

That is / In ire and in a great heat and furye shall he go forth to destroy
and kill full many. Even as many as shall follow and have followed these godly
learned menis holy doctrine of ye gospel. Then sent he to his cardinals and
bisshops in every country as to Thomas Wolseye archebisshop of york and
Cardinal to persuade the king / some to persuade themprour / some to ye
French king / some to Scotland etc. that the gospel now risen was dampnable

Now therefore themprour and kings all (but some of ignorance) played anticrystis

while till there come yet moo terrible tydinges from the north east. And let
them still fume and foam out fire and water fagets and sword until not only
fearfuller rumors / but also the turk himself be in their neckis. But yet in
the mean time it is possible ere these wars (now begune. 1544. in July) be
ended / that every sowth west kin ge may hear ferefull tydinges from the
north east each one of other. And all they together at last shall hear

And he shall setfast his strong castles Text.

The serpentyne sead the pope of all beasts the subtylest and fardest
forecasting dreading these tidings long ago builded him many strong castles in
Rome and Italy betwixt ye two seas one called mare adria ticum and the the other
called Tyrrhenu^. Rome his chief seat of his rest and pleasure being situated

The French king lies betwixt the mediterrany sea and the sowthe oceane /
yea now he has the Popes two horns and the emprours sword to defend him.
His high hill whereupon he rests is / to be called the most christian king.
Besides these holy helps and defenses / the Pope has Gods power almighty upon
earth / he has Peter and Paul in their most high indignacion and curses to
thonder and lyghten upon whom he lysteth. France has S. Dionyse with his long

papis^rye. These all have their most strong and mighty god Mayzim / with
infinite daily misses and the perpetual prayers of the papistis with Sancta
Maria and all sayntis to pray for them. Shall there any ferefull tydinges from
the north east fray any of these cruel beasts? yea verily / if they repent
not in time in sak and ashes / for sheding of so miche innocent blood for the
gospel / and will not in time c^asse persecuting / and receive the word
humbly enbracing it with thankis / believe it and defend it. But how long else
shall they sit in fear in these their own holy hills? The text says: Not
long. But they shall come to their end. And to what end (I pray you)? The
text says. Et non erit eis adiutor. That is to say: Not withstandinge all
these great seas / defenses / towers palaces / high holy tytles / tyches / men
money / great gunnes. yea for all their policies and study / yet in their
most need shall there not be one to help them. No not their own great god
Mayzim / nor Marye nor not one of all the sayntis in their chirches / nor in
heaven may help any one of these anticrystes.

The Jews once at siche like terrible tydinges from the north east / pretended
and trusted to like defenses / for they had their situacion betwixt ye west sea
/ and the floude Euphrates. Their temple and cite Jerusalem were builded
pleasantly upon that holy high mount of Sion well fortreced and turretted. And
when the prophet Jeremy told them these terrible rumors from the north east
/ that the king of Babylon should come to destroy all. They answerde / that
it was impossible: for that they were the people of God / they had his laws
decent rytes and laudable cerem. and miracles for them / they were circumcised
and had the sealls and sacraments of his covenant / and the Babylonits were
infidelis / not ye people of god / but haithen folk / and therefore presoned
they the prophet Ierem. and conspired his death and diverse other they slew
for telling them siche tidings. But yet came they to that same end noman
helpinge them. And albeit now our false cristians and true anticrystis
pretend the same britle buklers / saying ^e be crystened / we be gods people /
redeemed by christ / we serve god trewly day and night / no where is he so
richely and so prowdly served as emonge us / we have his sacraments and daily
infinite misses / wherefore if any man tell us of the turks incursion to destroy
al cristendom / we ought to kill him as a false precher and falser prophet.
For God shall never suffer his crystened people to be destroid of an heithen
turk. well.

The turk therefore / when he shall have this conqueste over all cristendom /
he shall also hear like ferefull tidings from the north east. And he shall
fly to siche shiftis as now do our christian turks and anticristes. For his
great mighty palace of Byza^cie is sewerly builded alredye be twixt the aeuge
seas and Euxin sea. And he shall think himself the most mighty emprowr of
Rome and conquierer of the hole world. But yet shall he come to his end /
noman helping him. For aftir this fowerth Roman Monarchy / there shall be no
moo. For here shall comeforthe the watchinge and awaitlaying roaring lyo^ out of

savior christ that yet he will standeforth and arise up to deliver us from
these so many and so cruel torants and anticrystes / making us unable to be
ouercomen through only faith and by the confession of the almigh ty gospel. By
that so troubles so heuey and greuouse a time as never was nor shall be / he

is thus persecuted within and without / at home of their own familiare feigned

world. This is confirmed not only by Crystis wordis Matthew. 24. but also by
this place of daniel. But yet are the elect written in the book of god / for
whose sake the gospel is / and shall be preched and the chosen shall not be
lost. Let us goforth therefore unto our solace rest and counforte even unto
the resurreccion. See how ioyously the angel reioyseth and haasteth himself
unto the last day / so that before he would speak of Michaels office he would
ingraffe the place of our resurreccion so full of solace / that we might be
certifyed that when Anticryst is reveled / then is there nothing else to be
waited fore but the resurreccion of the dead. But yet shall these cruel
persewers (as in the time of No^e) before the floude / eat and drink ma^ye

This article of our resurrection. Where in we shall have that most ioyouse

these last days. And the greter is our coun^orte for that we know it and see
it now at hand. And although christ says / that day and howr to be known

him that has it shall be given / to him that has no pleasure to read daniel
/ that knowledge he thinks himself to have / it shall be taken from him. No man
can know perfectly these prophecies until he see them fulfilled or in
fulfillinge (as they be even now) god so reuelinge them to him.

Aftir this I daniel looked up / and lo / there stood two other / one on this
side of Text.
^flowde and ye the other on ye other side. And I said to the man cl^d with the
lyne^ vestu^e standinge above the floude. When the^ Apoc. 10.
shall there be an end of these meruelouse things? And I herd him that stood
in lynen above the waters of the floude / which (his right and lift handis
lyftedvp into heaven) swore by the ever lyuinge god / that all these things
shall have an end / aftir that they have fully dispersed and skatered ye power
of the faithful people to endure unto the determined time / whether it be long
or short (or else as has another text translated by doctor Joan Draeonites)
All these shall endure for a time / times and an half. And the dispersion of
the holy people ended / all these thin ges shall come to pass.

This is the time of the delyuerance of the persecuted church and of the end
of the world. Daniel here sees two aun gels of each side of the flowde one
against And yet stand there the same angels against our church.
and contrary to the the other / which signified the two angels mentioned in the
x. chap. making war against the Jews letting the buyldinge of their temple
encensing the kings of Persye and Medis lost the word should have encreaced
with fruit. The man cled with lynen was Ga briel. The askinge of Gabriel how
long the persecucion should endure is the voice of the wayling and wepinge
chirches desyering to know ye end of their greuouse persecucio^s / which be
here called marvelous and wonderful: for that there can be nothing thought
more wonderful to be merueled at / then thus to see satan by his instruments
the tyraunts / heretykes and anticrists without end to persecute / so that if
one enemy of ours be ouercomen / yet he ever stereth up another with whom we
must euerfyght and never cease. It is a wondrefull war of so many and so
mighty princes of the world / against so few and feeble a little ferefull flok /
that so many and so mighty should be afraid of ve which nether with material
sword nor shylde can fight / but only with our lyppes / pens and prayers.
It passes all manis reason that we should in conclu sion have the victory. The
aungel / which with both his handis lyfted up into heaven swore by the lyuinge
god / was christ himself / clothed in whyght lynen / which betokened that he
should in time to come be borne of the pure virgin Marie and take unto him the
most pure and undefiled nature of man to be borne as is the sweet clear and
byrall dew dropes of the morninge descended from heaven standinge upon the
tops of the grass clearly to be seen against the son rising / as is his
natiuite in so few wordis declared in ye 110. psalm. aftir the Hebrewe text
saying. Thy concepcion shall be in the most high beutye clerenes and holiness /
as pure as is the dew conceived out of the women of the morninge. For as ye
vapores by the celestial power / be drawnvp out of the earth / and in the
morninge be condensed as it were into crystal perls or dew dropes / even so
by the supercelestiall vertew did the sone of god take unto him his very humane
body of the pure virgen that he the son of rightwisnes should come forth and
be borne into the world. This son of man standinge in whight lynen above the
waters or flowd / is christ treadinge Persecucion makes ^^ whight.
down all tribulacions and all the persecucions of his enemies / yea and even
his enemies themselves as sin death devil and hell making of them his fo^e
stole / he is cled in whight for that by his cross he should be made whight and
tried like silver: he tells Daniel how long this persecucion shall endure.
He tells him the most certain token that shall immediately The certain took
before ye end.
go before the resurreccion / even the dispersion and scateringe abroad of ye
holy people: which we see it this day many for the words sake to be dispersed
out of their own countries and londis as ma ny pore men yet feel it. But how
long this dispersion shall endure christ tells him not plainly. The zyrik
text says unto ye determined time of god / whether it be long or short / for
somiche signifies the Hebrewe phrase. Ad tempus tempora and dimidium. Few
days apere many and a short time is long to the afflicte persecuted. And in
the endinge of the scatering of the power of the holy people shall all these
thingis be finisshed. How long we shall be thus dispersed by persecucion / one
ly god knowth. But of this be we certain that this dispersion by persecucion is
the last and most certain sign that ye day of judgment is at hand. For God
declared unto daniel the order of the. 4. monarchies / which be all paste /
and the cruel kingdoms of Anticriste which should arise in the fowerth
monarchy / which at Mahumete and the pope be reveled. And the seculare
anticristes which shall end in the turk / begine fast to grow and to
prevail / which yet shall never be like in power to the Roman monarchy / when
it was in her first flowers. And therefore when the seculare Anticristen
kingdoms now begun in the christian emprowr kings and princes be deuolued into
the turkis imperie / the^ shall that day begin to sprin ge / wherein the dead
yet a sleep shall awa ke. The saying of Elye before in the. 9. lefe of this
book is known of all men / and it ought to be written in every manis wall is and
wyndows.

Christ tells us / the days to beshortened / as was the course of the years
unto Nohe^* floude shortened that the sins of the people might have been the
sooner This re keninge agreth with the. 1290 days taken for wekis in the next
lefe following.
smyten of. And if ye will aftir the plain wordis take the time times and an
half as it stondeth. Then think I / that the time is taken for ye time betwixt
or from this reuelacion unto daniel (which was a non aftir ye end of the
captivity of Babylon) and the end of ye destruction of the Jews by Titus /
which contains. 600 years and a little more. And the times / I take for the
long time dowbled even for the twelve hundred years sense / wherein has
continewed the persecucion of the church of the gentiles sense that destruc
cion of Jerusalem / even for the time of ye persecucion by ye Roman emprours
and aftirwarde by the Mahumete and ye turk and the pope and his seculare
impes. The half time / I take it for. 300. years / From ye destruction of ye
temple to this day 1474
which be the half of. 600. Now from the destruction of Jerusalem unto this
day there are. 1474. years / so that by this rekeninge the half time shall be
ended with in these. 30. years to come. But this rekening will I not certainly
affirm. But ra there take the half time / for siche a short soden time as no
ungodly man can judge it / but think it rather to be as long again / and so
provide for it whylis god suddenly kut him of / in the middis of his course / as
it is written. The blody ungodly deceytfull Psalm. 54.
shall not come to half the time they looked fore. These conjectures I permit
unto the iugements of the christian readers desyering every man not to be to
curiouse in this account / but to repent and believe the gospel / to be redye
and awayte for the lord is coming.

I herd it / but I understood it not / Text.
wherefore I said: Lord / what / or when is the last end of these things?
And he said: Go thy ways daniel / for these wordis are shut up and sealled up
unto ye last time. Very many in the mean time shall be purged / and made whight
and blown together tried as metal in the fire: but ye ungodly shall do
wykedly / nether shall all the ungodly understand nor regard these thingis /
but the wise learned shall regard and teach themforth.

Here it is showed to daniel. That these words concerning the time and times
and an half / or end of this persecucion / shall be sealed up and not known
until ye last time and last days of the world when iniquite shall prevail
and reign most rankest and rypest / and the ungodly shall not regard this
prophecye / but rather laugh the techers and declarers thereof to skorne as they
did in the time of Nohe The ungodly shall abuse these words into thencreace of
their own dampnable destruction and persecucion of the godly / which by
persecucion and skatering abroad / in great heaviness and perels / and at last
by greuouse tormentings and deaths / they shall be tried as is metal melted with
blowings in the fire. But the chosen godly teachers shall understand these
words in the later days / teach and give war ning to ye other and therefore
shall they have the knowledge of ye time and of the years. And as did Nohe an
hundred years before preche repentance making the arc to save the good / so
shall these good techers an hundred years before prechinge repentance buyld up
the arc of the gospel of salvation by faith in christ restored at last (as
even now these certain years past) to save and preserve the chosen from
dampnacion.

Furthermore as touching the time, Text.
wherein the perpetual daily sacrifice Luther last of al began to build this
arc
shall be taken away and from the time of the setting up of the abominable
destruction / there shall be a thousand / two hundred / and. xc. days / Oh
blessed man / that shall tarry and see the thousand three ho^dred and five and
thirtye days. 26. year ago.


Now comes the aungel nyerer the end to more specially terms unto a
determined time expressed by days. 1290. which make half an heb. 3 yers and an
half. In the 8. chap. it was told that aftir the taking away of the
continual sacrifice and settinge up of the abominable idol the sign of
destruction / there should be two thousand and. 300. days which make. 6.
years. 3. moniths and. 20. days / which is almost an hebdomade of years / in
yt which half hebdom. which is here in this first nowmber of. 1290. days /
the Jews were grievously skatered persecuted and slain of Antiochus until the
greater nowmber was fulfilled / that is. 133^. days beginning the the other half
hebdom. wherein the Machabeis got ye victory of Antiochus and restored the
daily sacrifices and tem ple all again. And therefore he here says: Oh blessed
is he that shall persevere and see the. 1335. days that is / shall escape that
miserable heuey first half hebd. and enter into the later half / that is / into
the later end of the hebdom. But if any man believes (says doctor Draconites)
that the angel here alludeth unto the seuenteth hebdom. in the. 9. chap.
where ended the comonaltie of the Jews by the Romans / he must confess by
these. 1290. days to be understood the half hebdom. that is / the. 3. years
and. 3. monethis / in the which time / by the emprour Caligula the idol was
setvp in ye temple / and the daily wont sacrifice was taken away by the
apostles Act. 15. and the Jews comonaltie utterly destroyed. For aftirward ye
sown of the go spell went over all ye world. Blessed therefore were they which
came to that day. But let us come to these present days / wherein we see and
feel miche and greuouse persecucions / and behold how greuouse and bitter it
is for. 3. 02. 4. years continually / and then aftir / how god remitteth it
for as long a ceason again to give us a place for a little ceason to rest us /
even as it were the halcy^n days to suffer his chir che to breathe a while:
that she may be the stronger against the next storm and bataill folowinge.

But turn these. 1290. days into wekis / which make. 24. yeris and. 24. w^kis
and then is it just that aftir caligula had done that blaphemie / the jews
amon aftir. 24. yeris were destroid by titus and immediately begane they to
destroy themselves by mutual civil sedicions. The continual daily sacrifice
and the abomi nation of the desolacion standinge up so long in our ^hi^ch^s /
^r their misses / Mayzim / popisshrites tradicions of me^ supersticiose ceremo
and images. When the gospel now of late begane to be resto red by the learned
menis writings and pre chinges and so to take away these said abominacions /
then their followed this great skat^ringe and persecucion of the faithful
which yet endures. In which would god these. 1290. days were turned but into
so many w^kis which make. 24. yeris and. 24. wekis / that blessed might
theibe which shall seethe. 1335. days ^^ make. 2^. yeris and. 35 wekis which
agrees with the said rekening of the time times and the half time. And if ye
turn the days into months / so itagreth with ye 100. yeris wherein the arc
of ^oh^ was in making before the floude. So that ethe^ with in these. 30. years
02. 100. years to come there shall be meruelouse mutacions in this world or as I
conjecture an end thereof. There is one man that takes the time for an
hebdomade of yeris that ^^ for 7. yeris and the times for two hebdo. that is
14. yeris / and the half time for half an heb. that is 3. yeris and an half: with
make. 24. yeris and an half / and he begineth at the yete of the lord. 1544.
to reken.

But I judge that it is not given to any at this time to know this misterye
concerning the very day and hour hyden in the nowmber / till it be
fulfilled. And there fore I do but conjecture and d^re not affirm it for
certain. As beit I know that God would have his chosen to be monisshed before
of the time and years by this prediccion. And therefore let us pray unto god to
govern and preserve his church and shortly to ^ut of this sinful course of
humane nature. Beware of images ^ B^ware of images and of mayzim.
of ^ayzim / which is not yet every where throne down / but only in certain
places of the over germany / where the gospel is purely preched and received of
men taught of god. For aftir his fall there shall begin greter trouble among the
godly by the an ticristes / either for the restor^nge of it / orels for the
bringinge in (I fear me) of ye Mahumets law and the turkis religion. But
these troublous last days shall not long dure. For god will be as merciful to
us / as he was to the jews in Antiochus time / not sufferinge that greuou
sepersccucion to continewe senger then Be knit it not up in few ye ris but i
many da yes.
ye said. 1290. days / he says days because the little time apereth so long
to the afflicted. Thus be we warned to persevere strongly in patience abydinge
the glorious coming of christ to judgment / to slaye this anticristen horned
whore of babylon with the almighty breathe of his mouth that we might have our
perpetual joy and test with christ.

But (daniel go thou hence until the end be comen and be at rest. For thou

shall stand up with thy part in the end of the times.

Here at last is daniel commanded of ye angel Christ to depart and to take
his rest / his body to lie down and sleep in the duste / and his soul to
rest in joy in Abraham's bosom / which is in heaven with god the father with
his sone and holy ghost / and with all ye holy angels and spirits of the lust /
until that gloriouse day of ye resurreccion / all crystis enemies thrust
down under his fete. And then he tells him / that he shall resume his
gloriouse immor tall incorruptible and spiritual body standing up again / as
it were from sleep / with his part and blessed company of the cho sen. Thus
shall we all both glad fresshe and joyful arise rogither in the last day
/ which is now owr most present co^solacion.

Jesus christ our resurreccion grant it us / that we might so understand

and in that everlasting scole perfectly learn to know and to honor God / unto
whom only be glory immortal. So be it.

Now give thankis to our celestial father through Jesus christ our redemer /
that he has at last so clearly by his prophet daniel reveled to us these so
secret mysteries: so that we be ass^wered / cry s^e our redemer to have had been comen and incarnated these. 154^. years ago / and that he shall come agene
shortly to deliver us mightily out of anticristis tyra^nye / and destroy him
with his almighty word. We beseech the oh father for cristes sake / ge ^e us the
very fear and faith in the / make us call upon th^for our only mediator
cristes sake to be herd: that among these so many and mighty frauds of
Anticryst: we ^hri^k not / we fall not from the / but that in thy holy fear
and pacie^t abydig / we might perseu^^ to our endis rest with daniel: and in
