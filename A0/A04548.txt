A True relation of Go^^ vvonderfull mercies, in preserving one alive, which
hanged five days, who was falsely accused.



LONDON Printed by Edw: Allde. dwelling on Lambard-hill, (...)

A True Relation, of a most wonderful and strange accident which happened on a
young man borne at Dort a town in Holland: who travailing between Franckfort
and Antwerp, was falsely accused for a robbery, and executed for the same at a
Town called Bon, where he hanged five days, and was by God mightily
preserved, to the great astonishment of all the beholders.
IN the town of Dort upon the long reed Bank (near the sign of the three
Pidgions) there dwelled a man whose name was John Peterson, borne in the City
of Antwerp: who married with a young woman, borne at Dort aforesaid: This John
Peterson with his wife lived many years together, he being a waterman, who
used to ferry passengers from Dort to Rotterdam, and his wife used the trade of
dressing of Flax: these two having had diverse children, it pleased God that all
dyed saving two Sons, whose names were, the one Nicholas Johnson who now
dwells at the Brill, the other John Johnson (for often they take their
surnames of their Fathers Christen name) of which John Johnson we are
hereafter to entreat: whose Parents dyed in the year of our Lord 1600. being
very poor.

This John Peterson being deceased, having a brother yet dwelling in the City
of Antwerp who understanding of the death of his brother sent to Dort for John
Johnson the youngest son of his brother deceased (being a pretty youth) who
thought it fitter to keep one of his own kinsmen, then the son of any
stranger: When this youth came to Antwerp, his Uncle gave him very kind
welcome, being joyful to see him, for he had never seen him before that time.
Now it pleased his Uncle to employ this John Johnson about his affairs, who
used such diligence in all things he went about, that he procured such love of
his Uncle, as if he had been his dear child, he could never have respected
him with more regard: and the rather, for that he gave his mind to all
virtuous and godly exercises: Insomuch, that whatsoever the young man did, it
was most pleasing to his Uncle, as also to most who knew him: He was many times
assailed by Jesuits (and others of that religion) to convert him from the true
religion which he then professed, but he continuing constant, by no means
would yield unto them: which being bruited in the City, he was of all the
godly generally well respected.

To come to the matter: his Uncle being a man of great trading in merchandise,
had occasion (with diverse other merchants) to travail to Francfort Mart (for
he used much to go thither) and thought it fit to take his kinsman John Johnson
along with him, to acquaint him in those parts, that he might the better
afterward have knowledge in his business: and his Uncle delighted greatly in
his company, by reason he was given to much honest mirth, for which all that
knew him did exceedingly affect him, and called him the Hollander, demanding
often of him, if all Hollanders were so pleasant as himself was passing on the
way? After their long journey, they came to Francfort, every man taking his
leave of other, intending to go about their affairs: And after some few days
of their continuance in Francfort, there came a Letter to this John Iohnsons
Uncle (from Antwerp) to certifye him of business of great import, which was
speedily to be disspatched at home: whereupon his Uncle having as yet effected
little business, did think it most convenient to send the said John Johnson to
Antwerp (knowing his sufficient care in any of his employments) whilst he
himself stayed till the end of the Mart. Now having commandment of his Uncle
to depart for Antwerp, he took his leave, and set forward on his journey
without any fear, for he had little to loose, and taking his iourneys to the
same Towns and Innes, where before he with his Uncle and other Merchants had
lain: At length he came to Bon, to the same Inn where he before had lodged,
which was near the marketplace, at the sign of the Swan, without suspect of
any danger: where also lodged diverse Merchants, with whom this John Johnson
that night supped, having had very good fare: and passing the time away with
pleasant discoursings, until it grew toward bedtime: and being showed their
chambers, the young man desired the Host that he would call him up very early,
who promising so to do, departed: This Host having espied one of the other
Merchants to have a Budget, wherein was good store of money, (who lodged in the
same Chamber where the young man lodged) thought with himself how he might get
this Budget, and to live unsuspected: at last he devised with himself, that
having the money, he would work so cu^ningly that none should be suspected but
the young man: The Host in the night came stealing into their chamber, there
taking away the Merchants Budget with money, and the young man's Wallet, wherein
was some foul linen, and shoes, and such like. When this Host had opened the
Merchants Budget, and taken out the money, he found also in the same a Seal
Ring and an Obligation, which Obligation and Seale-ring, the Host took out,
and with a silver Tonne of his own, whereon the Hosts mark was graven, and
which his guests did drink in the night before at Supper, he put these three
in the young man's wallet, and tied it up as it was before, and entering the
Chamber again laid the wallet in the place from whence he took it.

In the morning the Host (according to his promise) calls up the young man,
who presently rising, made him ready, paid his reckoning, took his leave, and
went his way on his journey, having the Merchants King and Obligation, with the
Hosts silver Tonne, tied up in his wallet, unknown unto him: so trauayling on
without any mistrust, it fortuned that the Merchant arysing, and missing his
Budget with his money, presently called out, saying he was robbed: and being
exceedingly perplexed, and in a great fury, the Host (as if he had not known
any thing) come speedily unto him, demanding the occasion of his outrage* To
whom he replied that his Budget with his money was stolen away from him: The
Host answering, that if he had loft any thing, there was none could have it
but the youth who lodged that night in the Chamber, and was so suddenly gone
away in the morning. Therefore let us with all speed take horse, and we shall
surely overtake him: Whereupon, with all haste that might be, the Merchant,
with the treacherous host, took their Horses, and in very short time they
ouertooke this John Johnson: The Host speaking very furiously unto him,
charged him of Felony, saying, thou have robbed this Merchant (who lay this
night in the same Chamber where thy self did lodge) of all his money: The
modest young man, at the first being greatly affrighted stood amazed, knowing
himself without fault, answered: Truly I am as clear from such offense, as any
person in the world: Yet notwithstanding, the Host was marvelous importunate
to have the young man's wallet searched, which being opened, there appeared to
their fight, the Hosts silver Tonne, with the Merchants Obligation and seal
King: which when the Merchant espied, he thought verily that none had his money
but he: The young man when he saw these things pulled out of his Mallet, almost
dyed with grief, excusing himself, that he never knew how they came into his
Wallet: but the Boast vowed that he should be hanged if it should cost him an
hundredth pound: So causing the youth to return back again to Bon, they
brought him before the Magistrates, who after his examination, he still denying
the fact, was committed to prison, put upon the Rack, and grievously
tormented: the youth feeling this miserable pain, cried to God for aid, and
voluntarily confessed that he had done the deed, although indeed he did it not:
Afterward, being brought to the public place of trial, he was there adjudged
to be hanged for that oftence: But when he perceived that he must needs die the
shameful death, he lamenting all his sinful life past, which he had committed
against the Majesty of Almighty God, he hoped to be saved in the faith he had
in Jesus Christ: So being led to the place of execution, in the presence of all
the beholders, said: I am here come to suffer death in this place, and now in
presence of you all, I take God to be my witness (and therewith wept most
bitterly) that I never knew of the stealing either of the Merchants money,
neither of the Hoasts silver Tonne, nor can any way devise by what means they
should come into my Mallet: and in respect I am clear of this fact for which I
am here condemned to die, I do beseech Almighty God that it will please him
through his great power, to show some miracle on me, whereby the truth may be
known; and that all men may perceane that I suffered innocently: the people
grieved much to hear him invoke the name of God in that extremity, prayed
also with him and lamented his timeles death, if he were as he said without
fault: so having ended his prayers, he was turned off the Ladder and hanged:
but the Lord God having heard his prayers, and knowing his innocence, did most
miraculously preserve him, as hereafter you shall hear.

His Uncle having ended all his business at Francfort, in the company of diverse
other Merchants, took their iournies homewards toward Antwerp, and according
to their wonted manner they took their Inn (where before they were
accustomed) at the Sign of the Swan in the Town of Bon.

In the morning following, when these Merchants intended to depart from thence,
The host being amongst them, told them that there was a young man, which was
in their company the last time that they lodged there, who had robbed him of a
silver Tonne which they used to drink in, and a Merchant (which lodged in the
house) of a great sum of money: for which offense, the young man was
apprehended, and afterward confessed the fact, and then adjudged to be hanged,
which is now five days since he was executed, and still hangs on the
gallows without the gates.

The young man's Uncle being stricken into wonderful admiration at this speech,
demanded of the Host what manner a fellow he was which committed the robbery?
he being well assured that his kinsman would not commit any such abuse: but by
the Hoasts description, in all things it was his kinsman: whereupon, because he
would be certain whether it was he or no, he earnestly requested the other
Merchants which were with him, to take so much pains, as to go with him to
see him, for he could hardly yet believe it to be him.

And coming to the place where the young man hanged, so soon as he came near
him, he espied him to be his kinsman, at the sight whereof he suddenly fell
down in a swound: but the Merchants helping him up, comforted him with all
their helps. Presently, the youngman (there hanging) spoke to his Uncle in
this manner following.

O my loving and most dear Uncle, although I here hang most shamefully, yet
am I not dead, for it has pleased Almighty God to preserve me, by placing a
stool under my feet, which to you is not perceived, upon the which I stand,
And the Angel of the Lord, from heaven, has fed me here five days: I
beseech you take the pains, to return to the Town of Bon, and certifye the
Maiestrater there, in what manner you have found me, and request them to come
with you, and I will let them understand that I am here hanged without any
offense: The Merchants hearing the young man speaking in this manner, were much
astonyed, and straightway departed from thence: and when they came before the
Magistrates, they before them upon their Oaths delivered what the young man
had related unto them: whereat the Magistrates maruailed, and presently with
the Merchants they went to the place where the young man did hang, and
perceiving al to be true which the Merchants had reported unto them, they
caused him to be presently taken down, who was then in perfect health,
although he had hanged five days.

But God, the defender of all that put their whole trust in his mercies, seeing
this young man's innocence (to make his wondrous works to seem the more
admirable, and to bring the truth to light) preserved him all this time,
without any peril or danger.

Then the Magistrates (in the company of those Merchants) having seen this
miraculous work of the Lord, brought this John Johnson into the Town, where
they examined this youth thoroughly of all doubts, who certifyed them of all the
manner: first of his coming to such an Inn, then how he requested his Host to
call him up in the morning, then of his departing, and afterward how the Host
with the Merchant came riding after him, and apprehended him: which when they
perceived, presently they sent for the Host, to examine him upon the
perticulers, touching this young man: but when the Host beheld the young man
still to be alive, the Host presently confessed the deed, and how he himself
had wrongfully accused that youth of those fellonies which he himself had
committed. When these Magistrates heard all the truth of this business, they
praised God for preserving this young man, and brigning to light the wretched
offender: And so sentence was pronounced upon this Host, that he should be
conveyed to prison, and the next day to be bound to a Stake near the place
where the youngman was hanged, and there to be burnt: which was accordingly
performed. And likewise it was ordered by those Judges that the young man
should possess to his own use, the sum of three thousand Guilders, of the
Hosts money, in recompense of the injury was done unto him.

After this execution was ^inished, the young man, with his Uncle, and the
other Merchants, taking their leaves of the Magistrates, departed toward
Antwerp where now this John Johnson, with his Uncle Gerard Atthonyson, do at
this day remain, near a place called the Mere, or water. Whosoever do
repair to that place, may be an eye-witnes, and see the party who was executed
as before is declared.

The Magistrates of Bon, caused this to be Printed, to set forth the mighty
power and glory of God, as themselves were witnesses thereof.

FINIS.
