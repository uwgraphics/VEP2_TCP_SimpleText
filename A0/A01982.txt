LONDON Printed by Io. Beale, 1616.

The Printer to the Reader.
Good Reader,
THou have here again these short Principles of Religion published for thy
good. I have the opinion of others, whose judgments I have just cause to
reverence, concerning the soundnes of them. And I doubt not but thou thy self,
if thou shall thoroughly observe and weigh them, wilt find abundance of matter
couched in few words. The fewer and briefer that the Principles be, the
sooner are they learned by heart, and the more firmly are they retained in
memory. They way easily be by word of mouth enlarged and amplified by any that
has any competent measure of knowledge. The texts of Scripture whereunto the
Reader was referred before only by quotations in the margent, are now expreslie
set down directly against the words, that thou may more readily see the
proofs, and compare the Principles and proofs together. There are also added
two Prayers, fit to be used morning and evening in a family, by such as
cannot pray without some such helps. These forms of Prayer, were gathered out
of such Prayers as the Author of these Principles has at diverse times used,
by one that has often heard him All are published for thy good* Farewell.

again, Mat. 13* 41, 42

The rich man died, and was buried: and in hell he lift up his eyes being in

Morning Prayer for a Family.
O Eternal God, we thy poor servants acknowledge that from thee we first
received our being, and every good thing we enjoy* and that by thee the same is
continued and preserved unto us, by thy good providence is this day renewed
unto us, and we kept safe unto it: wherefore, desirous to perform our duty
unto thee, and to receive a blessing from thee, (without which we cannot
prosper in any thing that we take in hand) we do humble our selves before the
glorious throne of thy grace, to offer up unto thee our morning sacrifice of
prayer. We know that our sins have made us odious in thy sight, unworthy of
all thy blessings, and liable to all the judgments denounced in thy Word: they
are for number innumerable, for we have committed more sins then we have
lived moments; all our thoughts, words, and actions have been sinful, even
the best things which we do are defiled with that sinck of natural corruption
which is in us, and by our careless manner of performing them. Every sin is
in the nature of it infinitely heinous, because it is committed against thee, a
God of infinite Majesty: but our sins are so much the more heinous, because
they have been committed against our knowledge and conscience, yea and against
those manifold means, which thou in mercy have affoorded to keep us from
sin: we have long inioied the Ministry of thy Word, but have little profited
thereby: thou have accompanied the same with many sweet blessings, all which
we have abused: like a careful Father thou have tenderly corrected us; yet
we have not been bettered thereby, but carried our selves stubbornely against
thee. We are very prone to yield to all the corrupt suggestions of our flesh,
and to the evil temptations of the Devil: and we are too much delighted with
the wicked customs and fashions of this world: but exceeding dull and untoward
we are to all holy exercises, and to every good thing. When we enter into an
examination of our spiritual estate, we can find in our selves nothing but
matter of horror, and of despair: we do therefore, as we have just cause,
utterly deny our selves, and renounce all confidence in our selves, we fly to
thy mercie-seate for mercy and pardon, and that in the name of thy dear son
Christ Jesus, who came to save sinners, and who by the sacrifice of himself
has made a perfect satisfaction unto thine infinite justice for all our sins
Enter not therefore into judgment with thy servants (O Lord) but accept of
that alsufficie^t sacrifice of Christ for us; and be pleased we most humbly
beseech thee, to remove the guilt and punishment of all our sins, that they
may never rise up in judgment against us, to deprive us of thy favor and
blessing, or to provoke thy wrath and vengeance against us in this world or in
the world to come. And we do also earnestly entreat thee for Christ's sake to
subdue in us all our corruptions, that they may not bear such sway in us as
they have done heretofore: make us wise and watchful over our selves, that we
may avoid as all sins, so all occasions and prouocations, whereby we may be
lead into evil: and make us conscionable in practicing all good duties which
we are bound to do, and in using all good means whereby we may be kept in
compass of our duty. O Lord let thy good spirit always abide in us, to
assure us of thy love to us, and to renew us daily more and more according to
thine own most glorious image. We beseech thee to inlighten our dark
understandings, to rectify our perverse wills, to mollify our hard hearts, to
quicken our dull affections, and to reform all our outward parts, so as we may
serve thee in true holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.

Make us just, faithful, and true in all our actious and words: make us
pitiful and merciful to such as stand in need of our help, and that according
to their necessity and our ability: and grant that by our humble, modest,
gentle carriage of our selves toward all men, we may adorn out Christian
profession.

And now, heavenly Father, we commend our selves, souls, and bodies to thy
blessing. Bless us we beseech thee in our callings, direct thou the work of
our hands, and prosper them unto us. Sanctify also all thy good creatures
which thou affourdest unto our use.

We humbly beseeth thee to bless also thy whole Church: and particularly the
whole Nation wherein we live: continue in it the light of thy Gospel, and give
a free passage thereunto. Vouchsafe unto it all needful prosperity. We
heartily pray thee to bless our royal Sovereign King James and his
government: long preserve his life, and health, and reign. Bless all our
Magistrates and Ministers of thy holy word. Succor all the aflicted members of
Christ Jesus. Do good to all our kindred, aliance, friends, acquaintance,
neighbors. Link all of us together by the bond of thy holy spirit, who are
knit by any outward bond; that thus we may have just cause to rejoice one in
another, and to bless thee one for another. Let thy blessing remain on all
Christian families which call upon thy name, and particularly upon this our
family: grant that we may make our house to be thy Church by performing an
holy worship unto thee, that so thy gracious presence may be ever among us:
and because thy promises do belong to us, and our children, we pray thee to
bless our issue with all needful blessings. Work in us a religious care well
to train them up, and give thou a blessing to all the means that are used for
their good education, that they being taught by us to fear thee, may teach
their children also so to do, and thus thy fear be continued among our
posterity from generation to generation. O Lord our God, we know that the good
things we want, and the dangers whereunto we are subject, are many more then
we can think of, yet are they all well known unto thee; we do therefore
entreat thee to bestow upon us what good things soever thou see to be
needful unto us, and to preserve us from al those evils which thou see us
subject unto.

According to our bounden duty we do also offer up our sacrifice of praise
unto thy divine Majesty, in the mediation of Christ: blessing thee first of
all, and above all, for those blessings which are proper to thine elect: as are
our redemption by Christ, our reconciliation with thee, our adoption to be thy
children, our justification and sanctification, and hope of eternal life,
together with all the good graces which by thy good Spirit thou have wrought in
us. We thank thee also for all the means of our salvation, and for all the
means of preserving our temporal life. In particular, we thank thee for the
last nights quiet rest, and for bringing us safely to the beginning of this
day. Neither are we unmindful of thy general blessings upon thy whole
Church, upon this Land and Kingdom, upon our house and family, and upon all
that any way belong unto us. We acknowledge thee (O Lord) to be the Author and
giver of all things; and accordingly we give the praise of al unto thee.

Accept (we beseech thee) this our bounden duty, pardon all the defects and
imperfections thereof, for thy Son, and our Savior Jesus Christ's sake: in
whose name we conclude our prayers with that perfect form of prayer which he
has taught us, saying* Our Father, etc.

Evening Prayer for a Family.
Merciful Father, Lord of heaven and earth, by thy good providence have we
been safely kept this day, and all the days of our life heretofore. Many are
the blessings which thorowout the whole course of our life we have received
from thee. It has pleased thee to afford us sufficient means for the
preservation of our life, health, and estate in this world, and also to bring
us to eternal life: we praise thy holy name for them all: And now being about
to go to our rest for this night, we commend ourselves, souls, bodies, goods,
and all that belong to us, to thy safe keeping. O Lord accept us in thy beloved
son, and be reconciled unto us, pardon we beseech thee all the sins which this
day, or at any time heretofore we have committed against thee: grant that we
may put off the old man with all the corrupt lusts thereof, and that the nearer
we approach unto our dissolution, and the glorious appearing of Christ unto
judgment, the better we may be prepared thereunto. For this end (we most
humbly and earnestly pray thee) our knowledge of thy holy will, strengthen our
faith in thy gracious promises, establish our hope of eternal life, work in
our hearts such a sweet sense of thy love to us, as thereby we may be provoked
to love thee again; and in and for thee to love our brethren, yea even our
enemies. Give us grace daily to renew our repentance, and to bring forth fruits
meet for repentance. Continue in us a true fear of thy great name, which may
keep us from sinning against thee; and an holy zeal of thy glory, which may
stir us up to honor thee. Season all other graces with honesty, and sincerity
of heart, wherewith thou (O Lord, the searcher of hearts) art much delighted. So
frame the disposition of our minds and hearts, as we may wholly resign our
selves to thy guiding providence, and remain contented in our several places,
patient under all crosses, thankful for all blessings, and constant in our
Christian course, till we come to receive the Crown of glory, promised by thy
divine Majesty to all that overcome. In particular, we beseech thee to bless
us this night, and to take us into thy safe protection. O our God, who neither
slumberest, nor sleep, watch over us whether we wake or sleep. Keep us,
and all that belong unto us safe from all dangers: especially keep our persons
safe from all the assaults of Satan, that he get no advantage against us.
Give us, we pray thee, such quiet and moderate rest, as our bodies may be
refreshed thereby, and we the better enabled to do that work which thou
appointest unto us in our several places. O Lord hear and grant unto us al
needful good things for Christ Jesus sake. In whose name and words we further
call upon thee, saying, Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

FINIS.
