An Epitaphe upon the worthy and Honorable Lady, the Lady knowles.
DEath with his Darte has us berefte,
a Gemme of worthy fame,
A Pearl of price, an Ouche of praise,
the Lady Knovvles by name.
A Myrroure pure of womanhoode,
a Bootresse and and a stay,
To all that honest were, she was
I say both lock and kaye.
Among the Troops of Ladies all,
and Dames of noble race,
She counted was, (and was in deed)
in Lady Fortunes grace.
In favor with our noble Queen,
above the common sort,
With whom she was in credit great,
and bare a comely port.
There seemde between our Queen and Death,
Contencion for to be,
Which of them both more entier love,
to her could testify.
The one in state did her advance,
and place in dignity,
That men thereby might know, to do,
what princes able be.
Death made her free from worldly carke,
from sickness, pain and strife.
And has been as a gate, to bring
her to eternal life.
By Death therefore she has receiu'de,
a greater boon I know:
For she has made a change, whose bliss,
no mortal wight can show.
She here has lost the company,
of Lords and Ladies brave,
Of husband, Children, friends and kin,
and Courtly states full grave.
In Lieu whereof, she gained has
the blessed company
Of Saints, Archangels, Patriarchs,
and Angels in degree.
With all the Troops Seraphicall,
which in the heavenly Bower,
Melodiously with one accord,
Ebuccinate Gods power.
Thus are we sure: for in this world
she led a life so right,
That ill report could not distaine,
nor blemish her with spite.
She traced had so cunningly,
the has of virtues lore,
Prefixing God omnipotent,
her godly eyes before:
And all her deeds preciselie were,
so ruled by reasons Squire,
That all and some might her behold,
from vice still to retire.
The virtues all, the Muses nine,
and Graces three agreed,
To lodge within her noble breast,
while she in Earth did feed.
A head so freight and beautified,
with wit and counsel sound,
A mind so clean deuoide of guyle,
is uneath to be found.
But gone she is, and left the Stage
of this most wretched life,
Wherein she played a stately part,
till cruel Fates with knife:
Did cut the line of life in twain,
who shall not after go?
When time does come, we must all hence,
Experience teaches so.
Examples daily manifold,
before our eyes we see,
Which put us in remembrance,
of our fragilitie.
And bid us watch at every tide,
for Death our lurking foe,
Since dye we must, most certainly,
but when, we do not know.
Some which to day are lusty Brutes,
of age and courage ripe,
To morrow may be laid full low,
by Death his grievous gripe.
Respect and parcialitie
of persons is there none,
For King, or Kaiser, rich or poor,
wise, foolish, all is one.
God grant that we here left behind,
this Ladies steps may tread,
To live so well, to die no worse,
Amen, as I have said.
Then maugre Death, we shall be sure,
when corpse in earth is closde,
Among the joys celestial,
our Soul shall be reposde.
FINIS.
Tho. Nevvton.
