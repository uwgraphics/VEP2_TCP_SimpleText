Love without Luck, Or The Maidens Misfortune
To the Tune of the new Celebrand.


IN the sweet temperate Air
of a May Morning,
When Ver and Flora fair
had been adorning
The lovely Fields and Meades,
Ualleyes and Mountains,
Cheering the bubbling Brooks
and streaming Fountains:
When Yonglings sport and play,
( Aestiua's Holyday)
As I walked on the way
for recreation,
Where each Lad with his Less,
Neatly trip on the grass,
As they the Meadows pass,
in lovely fashion.
Now Groves and Copses
loud Ecchos are ringing,
The Mauis Robin, and
early Lark singing,
Philomel chaunts her note
Iugg, Iugg, most sweetly,
And the fair Bird of May
Coo-koo discreetly,
Each Bird did chirp and sing,
To welcome in the Spring,
With cheerful solacing,
and fragrant Flowers
All lovely to the eye,
Smelling most curiously,
In choice variety
for Ladies Bowers.


Singling my self alone
for my contenting,
I heard a Beauteous One
sadly lamenting,
Tears down her lovely cheeks
from eyes distilling,
Sighing; and cursed the Time,
ere she so willing
Had yielded foolishly,
Up her Uirginitie,
And grown in misery,
after despised
Of him she held so dear,
Who had plucked from her there,
What she most deemed near
and highly prized.
Lands that are morgag'd
may often be redeemed,
But Uirgin-Honor lost
never esteemed:
Were she the fairest One
Nature ere framed,
That matchless Jewel gone
and she defamed,
In scorn it will be said,
There goes one was a Maid,
Yet has the Wanton played,
oh, this does grieve me,
Chiefly to think that he
Should so inconstant be,
Loving him faithfully,
thus to deceive me*
The second part.
To the same tune.


With that again she wept,
Her griefs renewing,
Whereon to her I stepped,
her feature viewing,
Thinking some Angel bright
in shape of woman,
So dazeled had my sight;
for I think no man
Ere yet beheld with eye
One more immortally,
(For wit and modesty,
grace, Art, and feature)
Decked with deportments fair,
And Beauties passing rare.
Thus I began. Oh Fair
Diuinest creature,
Tell me, where lives the Man
could be so cruel,
I Will right thee if I can
for thy lost Jewel,
And force him marry Thee
if thou desire it,
That he so false could be,
I do admire it.
Then with tears in her eyes,
Mournfully she replies,
He Is for some golden price,
rashly is ventred:
Else ore the Seas is gone,
With Marquess Hambleton,
And like a periurd one,
left me distempred.


But since the time that he,
the Seas has taken:
My friends despightfully,
have me forsaken:
Father, and Mother; All
Brothers and Sisters,
Lewd Strumpet do me call,
and as Detesters
They loath my company;
I dare not come them nie,
But may curse till I die,
all false Protestors.
That seek their wills to have,
And yet poor maids deceive,
Then do no credit give
unto such Iesters.
No marriage yet at home,
would I accept on:
Till at length over come,
by this young Captain,
Who had vowed earnestly
he would me marry
And his fair promises
made me miscarry,
For fearing of none ill
I yielded to his will,
Sorrow my heart do kill,
being disdained.
Let this my misery*
To all a warning be
To keep their chastity
pure and un(...).
FINIS.
