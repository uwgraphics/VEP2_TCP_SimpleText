Here begins the pardon or chartre of heuyns blys,
EVery wise man that cle^^^^^ or desires this heauenl^ (...) asks great
pardon / keep (...) ^^^^sely and has often mind upon the charter of his challenge
/ and the^lore each man learn to live virtuously / and keep and have mind upon
the chartre of heuens blys / and study busely and steadfastly ye wit of this bull
for the perdo^ thereof shall dure wtoute end therefore understand thou well that
ye chartre of this heritage / and the bull of this ever lasti^g pardon / is our
lord Jesus christ written with all the might and virtue of god / The parcheme^t of
this heavenly chartre / is neither of sheep / ne of calfe / but it is the body
and the skyn of our lord Jesus christ ye lamb / that never was spotted with wem
or spot of syn. and there was neither skyn of sheep neither of calfe / so sore
and so hard strayned on ye teyntur / either harow of any parcheme^t maker / as
was ye blessed body and skyn of our lord Jesus Christ / for our life streyned
and drawn upon the yebet of the cross. And there never man herd fro the
beginning of the world / till now / neither shall until domes day / that
ever wrytes wrote upon shepes skyn / either on calves with so hard and hydous
pe^nys: so bitter so sore or so deep / as written the cursed Iues upon the
blessed body and sweet skyn of our Lord Jesus Christ / with hard nails and
sharp spear / and sore pryckynge thorns instead of their pe^nys: for they
wrote them so sore and so deep / that they perced his hands and fete with hard
nails / and opened his heart with a sharp spear / and pressed upon his head a
crown of sharp thorns that lightly perced his brain pan. The wounds upon
that blessed body and sweet skyn of our Lord Jesus Christ / were instead of
letters / and as clerks sayen and specially saint Ancelme, that there were
open wou^des upon the blessed body of Christ by nombre / five. M.CCCC.lxxv.
this is the nombre of the letters / with which our chartre was written / by the
which chartre we may claim our heritage (if we live ryghteously and keep this
chartre steadfastly in mind). The sentence and understanding written within and
without this blessed chartre / and body of our Lord Jesus Christ / is our
believe.

For he is the cofer / in whom is closen and locken all the treasure / wit and
wysdom of god. Also upon this blessed chartre was written / waylyng and
mourning / song and sorrow / for sorrow of our sins: for the which sins to
be heled and wasshe^ away / Christ god and man must suffer so hard and paynfull
wounds: Upon Christ's body that is our heavenly chartre / was written
sygnifieng to al tho that perfytly forsaken their sins: for they han full
medecyn and health through virtue of the bitter wounds and precious blood of
Jesus. And upon the wou^des of Jesus / may be red sorrow to al them that for falls
lust and lykyng that dureth but a while / bynde^ the^ self so sore to sin and
seruage of the fend / and lesen, the help of their heavenly chartre and so
their heritage and we^den or go blyndly to sorrow that dureth for ever. The
lacys of this heavenly chartre / ben behestys of god / and that god may not lie
/ for he is sovereign truth. The first lace is his behestys / that what day or
ower a synful man or woman leueth their syn / holy and hertly with bitter sorrow
and turn them to him / he shall receive them to his mercy. But yche man
beware that he tarry not to long / lest for his own unkindness / grace be taken
fro him. The second lace is the full trust that we han or have / that god may
not lie / ne there be falls of his behestes: and here in hangs syckerly the
trust of our heritage: and by these two lacys / ha^geth the sele of our charter
/ seled with the blood of the lamb Christ: that is Christ's flesh / taken of
the clenest dropes of blood / in the swetest virgyn Mary / more craftily and
meruelously / than ever any may be by craft of kind / gather the wax of
flowers of the field. The prynt of this sele / is the shap of our lord Jesus
christ / hangyng on the cross for our sins / as we may se by the Image of
the Crucyfyx: for he has his head bowed down / ready to kys all those that
verily turn to him. Also he has his armies spread abroad / ready to be clyp them
and he is nailed to the cross fast / both fete and hands: for he will dwell
with them and never wend away from them: but if they forsake him first /
through syn. And he has al his body spread abroad / to give him self holly to
us cleuyng to him / and verily he has his side opened / and his heart cloven
for our sake: so yt without lettyng we must crepe into his heart and rest there
through steadfast believe and herty love This charter may no fire bren / ne water
dre^ch or drown / neither thief rob / neither any creature destroy. For this
scripture the father of heaven has hallowed / either made steadfast / and sent it
into the world the which scripture may not be undo / as the gospel witnesses.
This scripture is our lord Jesus christ's Charter and Bull of our heritage of
heaven. Lock not this chartre in thy cofer / but set it either wryts it in thy
heart / and all the creatures in heaven neither in earth / neither in hell / may
not rob it / neither bren it from the / but if thou wylt thy self / assentyng
to syn.

And if thou kepest well this Charter in the cofer of thy heart / with good
living and devout love / lastingly to the end / as trustly and trewly / as he
is true god. Through virtue of this Charter / thou shall have thy heritage of
blys / that lasts with outen end. Now therefore have we to penauns / as saint
Austen byddeth / and the last day be ever before our eyes. Refrain we our
bodies from byces and evil coueytynges / and ever let our hertes think
heavenly things / that when we come thither / we use fully heavenly goods: for
why we believe / that when our soul shall be vnknytted from the bond of flesh.
If we han or have lived well and rightfully before god / anon the company of
angels shall com into our metynges / and they shall bring us with worship to the
very domysman.

If that we han lived as I said / than peace shall be to us and sykernes in
compass Than we shall not dread the fyry darts of the devil / neither any
other manner enemy that comes to hurt our souls.

The flesh shall no more be adversary to the spirit / neither we shall dread
any perels. Than the holy ghost shall give to us a dwelling in heavenly things /
and we glad in joyful / and shall abide the day of dome to com / in which the
souls of al me^ shall receive meed for their deeds. And than shall sinners and
vnpytefull men perysshe. But in that day vain men and rauenours / gredy men
and proud men / auoutres and wrathful / coueteus / cursers and forsworn men
shall weep most bytterly / and they shall not get forgyuenes of their euels /
which left not their si^nes with bitter sorrow in their life. In most waylyng
they shall be holden / which seruyden to unlawful lusts of the flessh / and
they shall be in mourning and eueuerlastyng sorrow which serueden to vices /
either unreasonable desires. And as all these shall be worthy to be ordained /
to the fire of hell for their sins / and their great trespaces. So if we
please God here / while we ben in body we shall take everlasting reward with
saints. Therefore despise we all things that be vain and falling / that we
may get so great glory of Christ doing mercy: therefore bow we away fro vices
/ and go we to virtues and let not superflue words come out of our mouth. For
we shall yield rekenyng in the day of dome of all ydel words. Neither make we
our tongue to have custom to cursyng / which tongue is formed to bles and herrie
or praise God. For all things what ever is vnmesured / makes dyssolucyon of
soul / and neglygent against the lords hestes. Neither he may lyghtely clepe
or call his trespasces to mind / and so forgetting him self / styreth not him
self to penance / and so by little and little he passes fro goodness / and he
shall not have true co^punccyo^ of heart / where unlawful covetous dwells. But
sothly where tears shall be / there goostly fire is kendled / which lyghteneth
the preuyties of soul / and shows to it heavenly things. Therefore use thou
the fellowship of parfyt me^ and turn thou not away thine ears fro their
words / for the words of men dredynge god / ben words of life and holiness of
soul to them that here and perceive them. For as the son rysynge / dryueth
away the mist / so the teaching of holy men casts away darcknesse of our
hertes. Therefore I beseech you / eschew proud men / enuyous men / backbyters /
liars / forsworen men / and men despysyng their health / which ben deed in
virtues / and joy in their own lusts and want gods goods. I say not only
of them that been in thine house / but also where ever thou shall here such /
eschew the^ / and comune not with such men / if thou may not again clepe or
call them from their error: for why / often by one scabbed sheep / all the
flock is defiled. And a little part of gal turns much sweetness into
bytternes. For though such a man / seem to the clear in clothi^g and noble in
bringing forth of sweet words. Nevertheless if he does the contrary warkes /
such faynyng of him noyeth more / tha^ figure either shap pleases of words /
and every warke that thou thynkest to do first / think thou on god / and
examyne diligently / if that thing which thou thynkest / be of god / and if it
is ryghtfull before God / perform it / and else cut it away fro thy soul /
and beware of each wyckednes and syn / in word / deed and thought / in hands /
and in fete / in sight and in heryng / and keep we our body and soul for Jesus
Christ our lord god / the son of god the father that came down from heaven to
earth / he steyd upon the cross / and dyed for us sinners to deliver us fro
turmentynge of the devil / he suffered pain to deliver us fro everlasting
pain / he suffered death that we again rise in body and soul / in the last day
of the great dome And therefore it is said of the first church that one heart /
one will / one soul / is to them in the lord. For the charity and love Christ
had coupled them into one / and so must all Christen men / if they wylen be
saved. But flesshely men and lovers of this world ben departed against them
self / and ben vnioyned / mouynge sclaunders each to other / stryues / wrathes
/ chidyngs dissencyons / manslaughters / forswerynges / theftes / ravenous /
lecheries / dronkenesses / and all things which the world loves and the
flessh. Of who^ the Apostle says: He that sows in the flessh / shall repe
corruption. In such it is that the devil sows his seeds / forsooth our flessh
would ever be mighty in malice / but in abstinence fastings / and wakynges and
prayers / and good works / it fayneth it self to be syck / but the flessh
coueyteth and shows ever evil entysynge / the flesh stereth venomous doing
/ the flesh clepeth wrath the flesh stereth mansleynge / the flesh breketh
matrymony / the flessh sytteth in drunkenness / the flesh bears all the
covetousness of this world / and the flessh desires all the euyls. O thou
wretched flesh / not only thou sleyest thy self but also thy soul: thy own
loss suffyseth not to thy self / but that also thy soul be drenched or
drouned into hell. Woe to the soul which has taken the flessh / contrary to the
which nether enters / nether suffers the to enter into the kingdom of god.

Wherefore as Christ says: it behooves to wake and to pray. Lord / make you my
soul to have glory in the / that vaynglory and bost come not out of me / but
that bytternes of syn be aswaged. Also lord / give me grace to hold
rightwisnes in all things / gostly hardynes / temperans / and make symplenes
to be prudent in me / that I may led a clenly blessed life / and prudently
fly euel and that I may understand the trecherrouse and the desemblynge
falsnes of the deuell / lest he begyle me under lyknes of goodness. Also make me
to hold and keep these things: mylde / well wyllyng / peasyble / bonner /
temperate / and to accord to all goodness. Without faynyng / make me steadfast
and strong / in waking / in fasting / and in prayers, And also lord / give
thou to me / in myldnes to be mesured in word / that I keep sylens / that I
speak that thing that besemeth me to speak / and that I hold still that thing
that besemeth not to speak. Give me grace to keep thy faith undefiled without
any error in my works / to be worthy of faith All these sentences says saint
Austen in his book to the Earl,

HOC FAC ET VIVES.

Do this / and thou shall live.
