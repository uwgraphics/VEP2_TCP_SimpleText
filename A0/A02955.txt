THE KINGS DECLARATION upon the Riot, Felony, and Rebellion of the Duke of
Mayenne, the Duke and Knight of Aumalle and their assistants.
HENRY by the grace of God king of France, and Poland, to all men present and
to come, greeting. Whereas there is no commandment of God Religion, or
human law that can excuse the subject, for taking arms without the decree or
permission of his sovereign to whom it has pleased his Divine goodness, to
give all authority over him, and to whom only he has reserved the sword of
power, to use for the preservation of the good and the punishment and
correction of the bad, what may be thought of that subject, that takes arms
against his own most Christian, lawful and natural king? For in case this
crime be abominable in the sight both of God and man, and ought to redound to
the shame and confusion of such as commit the same, then is there among all
Christians no name odious enough for the Frenchmen, if through disloyalty,
riots, and fellonie they continue not the children of their fathers, those
ancient Frenchmen, who so virtuously with the peril of their own lives have
obtained and been noted among all nations in the world to be the faithfullest
and most loyal to their kings.

Again if to this so horrible a crime there may be added any increase in
respect of such bonds, benefits, and particular gratifications received by
the subject that armeth himself against his benefactor and lawful and
natural king, then are the Duke of Mayenne and the Duke and Knight of Aumalle
worthy that name, which as yet is not in use. And as their rebellion exceeds
all measure and example, so ought they likewise to be termed the most
unfaithful and disloyal in this world, also to leave to their posterity this
note of their ingratitude and rebellion, as a beautifying of the loyalty of
such as remain steadfast in their fidelity, and just and lawful obedience;
which God commands them to bear and yield to their king.

All this notwithstanding, so far did our clemency and good will extend,
that endeavoring to forget all former matters and just occasions, that they had
ministered unto us, to entreat and chastise them according to the deserts of
their disloyalty, even of our selves seeking their safety, with the care of
their wounds through our own, yea and the preservation of their lives and
honor, with the expense of our own authority. We have of late days sent unto
them sundry and many times, diverse of our good and faithful servants and
subjects, with our express letters, as also since our Herehaughts of arms to
give the to weet of our good and holy intent, withal that we were still ready
not only to forget all matters past, but also to receive the^ into our gracious
favor and cherish and embrace the^ as our good and loyal subjects, so long as
they should perform their duties and such their submissio^s as justly they owe
unto us. Nevertheless eue^ as an ambitious and treacherous soul is utterly
vncompatible of his Gods assistance, and through infidelity is no longer
capable of such reason as might co^teine or reduce him to his duty: As also
the Spyder, which is norished with the same licour where out the Be gathers
both honey and wax, does nevertheless convert the same into poison, so our
goodness and clemency infused into the hearts of such persons, abandoned both of
God and his holy spirit, are converted into corruption, but not into that
substance which they ought thereof to take, for in liew of humbling themselves
as they ought, and not confessing their faults, they are grown more proud, and
have plunged themselves in the destruction of both souls, lives, honors and
credits, together with whatsoever their domestical goods, by seasing upon our
towns and castles, and through their trachery and rebellion, enterprising
against our authority, our Magistrates, our good and loyal subjects and
servants, yea, even against our Prelates, Bishops, and other Clergy men,
who^ they have imprisoned, robbed, ransomed, and by torment enforced to resign
their benefices to their partakers, without respect of desert, or so much as
quality, as being contented that they were partakers in their wickedness, with all other unreasonable means of hostility, rebellion, and felony, and all this
under pretense and color of religion and godliness, as if themselves could so
much as once approach to ours, or to that of so many good and honorable persons,
whom they persecute as guilty, only because they be their kings faithful
servants and subjects, and will not damn themselves, or have any portion in
their detestable rebellion still having in their mouths that which is farthest
from their hearts, making a veil and cloak of Gods honor thereby to resist his
express word, and by their ambition, felony, and treachery, to subvert the
Catholic, Apostolic, and Romish religion, as heretofore they have sundry
times done, by seasing upon our towns and munitions, thereby to divert and
hinder us when we were best disposed and most resolute in our own person to
war upon the heretics, as also they would be very sorry there should be no
more in France, least thereby their ambitious purposes should have no farther
color.

And albeit through Gods grace we be not bound to give account of our actions
to any but himself, yet to the end the simplicity of some of our subjects
be not through their false suggestions abused and that they should wrongfully
imagine the late Duke of Guise to have been punished for being the protector
and defender of the Catholic Apostolic and Romish Religion, or for his good
affection to the commons, and that in respect thereof the said Duke of Mayenne,
Duke and Knight of Aumalle, and their associates may have had great and lawful
occasion to unite themselves, as well for their own particular preservation,
together with the maintenance of Religion, as for the revenge of him that dyed
for them, as they do report whereby to stir up and seduce our subjects and
to cloak their ambitious rebellion. Our pleasure is thereby fully to give
them, to understand that wickedly they have sought to cover their disloyalty
with the honor of God, the increase of Religion and affection to the common
wealth: for not to stay upon the particularities of the said Duke of Guise and
his brothers lives, the memory whereof is but to fresh yet in this Realm,
especially among such as were best acquainted with them, and not to wast so
much time about the writing thereof, it shall suffice us only to say that a
few days before the Duke of Guises death, the said Duke of Mayenne sent us
word by an honorable Knight, Sir Alphonso Corse, whom he sent to us, that it
was not enough for his brother to wear beads about his neck, but that also
it was requisite he should have a soul or conscience: that we should look
well to our selves: that it were good himself the said Duke of Mayenne, or the
said Knight should come to advertise us, and that the term was so short, as it
was to be feared he could not arrive time enough. As also we have not lost the
remembrances and letters containing his practices and procuring of amity with
the king of Navarre, and the heretics, as well within the Realm as without,
upon what soever conditions in case they would promise him their amity and
assistance for his establishment.

It is likewise sufficiently known what pensions he received from strangers,
upon what promises, and to what end: and his confederates with such as he did
most condemn before men as favorers of heresy, are not unknown to any, but
those that list not to know the same. These be those notable acts that he has
taken out of the lives of the Apostles and Gods commandments, for the
preservation of the Catholic Apostolic, and Romish Religion and the relief
of the people: whereas contrariwise it is well known where abouts our armies
were employed, that our intent was this spring personally to have gone forward,
and that there was no let in us, why the said Duke of Main should not war
upon the heretics, as well as our dear and faithful Cousin the Duke of
Neuers, who had yet continued our enterprise, had not our forces been diuerted
by the said Duke of Mayenne and the Duke and Knight of Aumalle, as already the
said Duke of Aumalle did the like the last year by surprising our Towns in
Picardie: and it may be said by the works of their hands, that the Huguenots
had never found so great favor, neither this poor Realm such misery and
oppression, but in the soul and life of the late Duke of Guise, the Duke of
Mayenne, and the Duke and Knight of Aumalle: As for the relief of the people
let the present estate of this Realm be considered, the losses and
destructions that it has encurred since the year 1585 when the said late Duke
of Guise, with the aforesaid of Mayenne and Aumalle took arms against us and
our authority, and let the iminent destruction of this realm be deemed by
such occurre^ces as have happened since that time, and so compared with the
former years of 83. and 84. as also the order that we had begone to take and
establishe in this our said Realm to the honor of God, and the ease of our
people, and agree their relief and the charges of the war with the actions of
the said late Duke of Guise, and the aforenamed, who since that time never laid
aside their weapons, sometimes under one pretense and sometimes under an other,
note also the countenance of the said late Duke of Guise and his assistantes
when we, contrary to his expectation, granted unto the deputies of our Estats,
the discharge and reductions of tallages to the state they were in An. 1576.
always provided that they would minister means to supply the stock and
satisfy the enterteinement of the Royal dignity and the estate, and to
prosecute the war which they all had so solemnly desired and sworn, wherein
them selves should by our decree, have the administration of the coin, as they
had promised us: for at that time on the one side he dissuaded us from doing
it, willing us not to abase our authority so far, but to make our selves to be
believed, and on the other side he urged his partakers to proceed in such their
instant suites, yet not upon any earnest desire thereto, but rather to bring us
either into necessity or into hatred with our said subjects, with firm
resolution, upon our refusal, to break up the Estates, upon so plausible a
ground to the people and him self to reap the honor and thanks for that
which he least meant, rejecting upon us the envy for that which we extremely
desired: and which we did upon our great affection to the relief of our
subjects, so far as in us might lie, and that the preservation of our Estate
would permit, even contrary to his advise and counsel, and all such
persuasions as he used either by him self or his to the contrary.

Also in respect of his behauiours toward us, after we had remitted and
pardoned al his former transgressions, his rash arrogancy was grown to be
such, that the opinions in our Counsel were no longer free, he made him self
to be believed. The execution also of sentences and judgments given in our
sovereign Courts, against the most lewd and guilty in this land was
deferred in that they could not be caught, and yet were they safe in his train
and chamber, yea and he procured them to be lodged in our Court, so as they
were the honestest men and most zealous Catholics of this Realm, if once
they were his partakers: And contrariwise the honestest, and best Catholicque
was an hereticque, or at the least a Politicque, in case he would not swear
and take part in their treason.

He likewise did all that he might, that every man might know (and it was
one of his pollicyes) that he could do what he would: and that we had even
cast our selves into his arms, so far forth as to cause such rumors to be
spread throughout our Provinces, and to face the Deputies of our General
Estates, which would not depend upon him, and alter their books at his
pleasure, albeit there were but over many such chosen and nominated through
his violence. Witness that daily at set hours there was in his chamber a
Counsel holden of matters propounded, also what should be concluded in the
Estates by purchase, driftes or violence according as the said Duke of Guise
and his partakers had resolved, even in the face of the world, yea and he
boasted of it, and that there was no greater safety then in his protection,
likewise that it was a poinct of treason, to be our faithful servant, giving
out as a badge of injury this term HE IS ROYAL, and for a badge of honor, HE
IS A GVISART. He sought unjustly to command over him, whom God had constituted
in all authority, and soueraign power over him, and endeavored by the mere
benefits, honors and authority, which his king had bestowed upon him to take
from him both crown and life, at the least so soon as he had found means
somewhat better to establish his authority then as yet it was, if peradventure
he could have granted us so long life: for it is most certain and
sufficiently verified that he had already taken such order for his drifts that
he accounted him self Master of our Castle and person, yea he had unlawfully
seized upon the keys, even of our Chambers: The convenient weapons for the
execution of his practice and unfit for any other warrelick exploict were
found, albeit his favorers had used all means to convey them away, so to take
away all notice thereof, and his men were round about us. The companies of our
ordinances whom we had ordained for the safety of our selves, and our estates
were by him dismissed, yea so far did he proceed as by his letters signed by
himself and sealed, with his seal of arms, the inhabitants of Remorantine
were exempted from receiving a part of the Lord of Souurays company whom we
had there ordained: as also he took them into his protection and safegarde,
contrary to our letters patentes upon the partition, that we had made with him
self: expressly forbidding the general Commissarie for victuals, throughout
our Realm, to take from them any victuals, for the said company or any other.

Again the more to show that he would no longer depend upon any other then
him self, such was his presumption, in the closet and presence of the late
Queen, our most honorable Lady and good mother, and sundry other Princes and
Lords there present, as when the trespasses of treasons came to be propounded,
to the end to be renewed and sworn unto in full assembly of our Estats, to
answer us most impudently that he would not do any thing, neither would
swear thereto: but that if he transgressed we should cause him to be punished:
and yet all this notwithstanding, together with diverse others warninges of his
driftes and dealinges, daily given us by our good, faithful and loyal subicts
and servant, we passed over all these things quietly, as persuading our
selves that our great patience and benefits, wherein we spared not any one
gratification that lay in our power, to them and theirs, would mollify the
hardness of their hearts, and reduce them to their just obedience due unto us,
considering the fierceness of Lions, and other the most wild beasts is
commonly tamed by benefits: but as the ambitious desire to reign is
insatiable and infinite, and that he that offends does never forgive: so
these men's insolences daily increased, and by an express messenger who^ the
said D. of Aumalle sent us we were advertised that himself had been present
in person, but not in will (said he) in a counsel holden at Paris, wherein it
was resolved that the Duke of Guise should fease upon our person and bring us
to Paris, which notwithstanding, we would not upon our first considerations
have such respect to this advice as we ought: howbeit upon the view of him whom
since the aforesaid D. of Mayenne sent unto us, seeing also the term so short
as there was no safety for us, but in the prevention of the lives of those who
sought to take away ours, and to usurp our estate and Crown: we were forced
to use and practice upon their persons, not what through their treacherous
felony they deserved, but according as the season would bear that which we
ought, yet would not have done.

This was the recompense that they had prepared for our gratifications and
benefits, and is at this day prosecuted by these, who during their lives
seemed to condemn their counsels, and did themselves give us warning of the
same, to the end (as we do find by their works) to reserve to themselves, and
to turn to their particular profit the fruit of this ambitious drift of
empire, according to this ancient proverb. If equity be violable, it is to be
violated for a Kingdom, and either we have no judgment, or else by their
actions we must believe as they now do agree together to take from us our life
and crown, which GOD has given us, so shortly they would have scattered it,
or else fallen a debate among themselves, who should emoy that which they seek
so unjustly to usurp, in case they had any opportunity to invade it: as
having already undertaken authority to dispose, and by letters patentes to
determine of the government of out provinces, and of the leueying and
distributing of our treasure.

But seeing patience ought to be limited and restrained within certain
bounds, beyond the which it can not be commendable in a Prince that owes the
preservation of his honor, authority, and life unto his estate and him self.
We upon these causes with other just considerations us moving, with the advice
of the Princes of our blood, the Cardinals, Prelates, Lords, and others of our
Counsel, have declared, and by these presents signed with our own hand do
declare the said Duke of Mayenne and Duke and Knight of Aumalle to be fallen
from all their callinges, offices, honors, authorities, gouernementes, charges,
dignities, privileges and prerogatives which heretofore they have had and
holden ofvs or our predecessors kings of this land: and that all the same we
have and do at this present revoke: also we have and do denounce and declare
them infidels, rebels, attaint and convict of rebellion, felony and treason in
the highest degree: farther our pleasure is that as such they be prosecuted,
both they and all that shall assist them with victuals, counsel, comfort,
aid, strength or goods what soever: likewise against all their posterity by
all means and rigours of the statutes made against such transgressions.
Unless by the first day of March next ensuing the date hereof, without further
delay they confess their fault and return into that obedience, which justly
they own unto us, even by the commandment and express word ofGod,
withstandyng the which, they can not term themselves Christians to the end we
satisfye our selves in that we have not omitted any one courtesy, clemency, or
favor that might reclaim the^ from their offense and reduce the^ to their
duty. Enioyning our chief vshers, sergeants or other officers to signify unto
them these presents either personally and together or particularly: Also in
case with safety they ca^ not do it, our will and pleasure is that the notice
thereof made at the gates or walls of their dwellings, or of the towns or
suburbs wherein they shall chance to be, by our chief tro^petter: or if he can
not safely for this purpose come so near them, in the next borrough or
village, shall be effectual and of as great force and strength, as if it were
done to their own persons. Moreover we command and adjure all our good,
faithful and loyal subjects, of what soever calling or condition they be,
by that loyalty which justly they owe unto us, which also God and their honor
do command, and by the ashes and memory of their forefathers, who so many
years and with so great pains, sweat and labor have purchased the^ that
precious treasure, and immortal name of most faithful to their Kings, that in
this affair of such importance as is the preservation or subversion, not only
of our authority, but of christian religion, the state and themselves, they
ouerrun the said infidels and rebels, and assist us with their forces and
power and draw unto us upon the first sommons to the end to punish such as
wilfully vvil persist in their rebellion and to restore our authority,
together with our estate into their former eminency and dignity, to the honor
of God, the preservation of the Catholic, Apostolic and Romish religion,
and the relief of our subjects, whereto we are resolved to employ whatsoever
our means and our own life.

Also to the end no man pretend cause of ignorance, we have ordained and do
ordain that these presents be read and published throughout al our sovereign
courts and seas royal, for such is our pleasure. In witness vvherof, we have
to the same set and fixed our seal, that it may remain firm and inviolable
for ever. Given at Bloys, in the month of February, the year of grace 1589.
and of our Reign 15.

THE KINGS DECLARATION upon the Riot, Felony, and Rebellion of the Towns of
Paris, Orleance, Amyens and Abbeuille, with other their adherents.
HENRY by the grace of God king ofFraunce and Polande, to all men present and
to come, greetyng. God who of his divine goodness of nothing has created man
to his own similitude, and all things to serve him: The same God has also
constituted kings withal authority and sovereign power over the nations,
whom he has given the^ to rule and govern: with this good order that they
shall obey what soever they shall be commanded, and the Prince shall command
what soever his pleasure, as to his subjects, in such manner as it can not be
denied, but that he that disobeyeth his lawful and natural Prince, resists
the express word of God: and he that fulfilleth not his commandments and yet
terms him self his son, is a liar.

Now among all kings instituted by God, we through his grace bear the title
of Most Christian, and be the chiefest of all Christian Kings, as also the
Frenchmen have evermore been noted above all nations in the world, to have been
most faithful and loyal servants and subjects to their kings, and to that
Royal dignity which God of his grace has given us, together with the sword
of power, for the preservation of the good and the punishment of the wicked:
hereto have we added all the favors and benefits, all the gifts, grauntes
and honors, wherewith we have been able to beautify enrich and augment our
Towns of Paris, Orleance, Amyens and Abbeuille, and never denied the^ any
thing that might tend to their relief and increase, thereby to conteyne and
still move them more and more, to that obedience which justly they owe unto
us: But as the horse pampered up with the care and charges that his master
has bestovved upon him to have him well tended, does kick his benefactor,
only because he is too fat and has been too well used, and therefore will
not suffer his master to take his back, so the said Towns of Paris, Orleance,
Amyens and Abbeuille, through our great favor above all the Towns in this
our realmeand by enjoying to much liberty have in contempt of Gods
commandments, and of too great ingratitude taken arms and risen against us
their natural and lawful king, endeavoring by their treachery to deprive us
of our lives and authority, in recompense of our liberalities, and because we
had exalted them above their deserts. Howbeit in consideration that the
simplicity of some may have been seduced through false suggestions, and under
pretense of piety or Religion: vvaying also the innocence of others which
inhabit the same towns, and yet were no partakers in so damnable counsels, to
the end not to undo the good through the wickedness of the bad: Al these
considerations, together with our natural clemency had procured us not only
to forget all matters past, but also of our selves to seek unto those that had
so grievously offended us, to the end to have received them into our favor,
and to have cherished and embraced them as our good and loyal subjects, upon
the confession of their faults, and such submission as justly they owe unto us:
But in liew of acknowledging their errors and humbling themselves, as men
forsaken of God for their contempt and disobedience against his express
commandment, and upon their Felonye and Riot committed against their lavvfull
and natural King, they have spitte their venoume against the Bishops,
Prelates, Magistrates, Nobility, and al sorts of people without distinction
or consideration of calling or crime, only because that obeying the express
word of God, they remained faithful to their prince, and would not with them
become rebels and infidels to God and their king: yea they exceeded so far as
to kill and violently to dismiss the Curates of their charges only for
exhorting the people to pray to God for their king: and as the said towns are
extreme in their treacheries, fellonies, and rebellions, so have they not to
this hour fogotte^ or absteined from any one jot of cruelty, no not of
sacriliege: and yet will they do worse in case they be not prevented by
punishments worthy their felony and detestable rebellion. We upon these causes
with other just considerations thereunto us moving, have with the advice of the
Princes of our blood, the Cardinals, Prelates, Lords and others of our counsel,
declared, and by these presents signed with our own hand, do declare the said
towns of Paris, Orleance, Amyens and Abbeuille, fallen from all estats,
honors, power, government, charges, dignities, privileges, gifts or graunts
what soever they have had of us or other the kings our predecessors, all
which we have and at this present do revoke. And we have denounced and
declared and do denounce and declare the^ to be rebels attaint, and convict of
the crimes of Riot, Felony and Treason, in the highest degree. Also we will
that as such they be proceeded against, as well they as al those that do
inhabit among them or shall assist the^ with victuals, counsel, comfort, aid,
force, or goods, and against their posterity, by all means and rigours of any
ordinances made against the said transgressions: unless by the 15. day of the
month of March next ensuing the date hereof, they acknowledge their trespass,
and return into the obedience that justly they owe unto us, even by the
commandment and express word of God, contrary to the which, they cannot be
called Christians.

Further upon the same penalties enioyning all officers of our Courts of
Parliament, Chamber of accoumptes, general of Aids, chauncery, records of
our treasury, chamber of moneys, presidiall sease, bayliwickes, seneschalsies,
prouostships, elections and other bodies and companies, as well of judgment as
of our treasury, vshers, notaries and sergeantes, and generally all other our
officers that are in the said towns, immediately upon notice of these presents
to come forth, by what soever means or manner and to draw unto us, or to such
other places as by us they shall be appointed, and there to minister justice to
our subjects, and to execute all other functions incident to their offices,
the exercise whereof we have suspended and forbidden, and do suspend and forbid
in the said towns together with all Courts, Jurisdictions, and notice of
matters, declaring from henceforth to be void and of no effect or value, all
and every their actions by them to be done, wrought, or attempted contrary or
to the prejudice of these presents: whereby we command our chief usher,
sergeaunt or other officer, to signify unto them either jointly or severally
these presents: Also in case they can have no safe access thereto, we will
and our pleasure is, that the signification or placardes thereof set us upon
the gates, walls, or suburbs of the said Towns by our chief Trompetter, or
if he can not safely approach so near to that effect, then in the next Borough
or Village, to be effectual and of like force and strength, as if it were done
to their own persons, bodies or companies. Inhibiting and forbidding al our
subjects whatsoever, not to prosecute in the said Towns, before the said
Courts, seas or officers any what soever expedition, whether of justice or
otherwise, under pain of nullitie, as also of being denounced favorers and
adherentes to the said rebels, seditious and disloyal persons.

We do moreover command and adjure all our good faithful and loyal
subjects, of whatsoever function or calling, by the same fidelity which
justly they owe unto us, and which God and their honor do command, and by
the ashes and memory of their forefathers, who so many years and with such
pain, sweat and labor have purchased unto them, that precious treasure and
immortal name of most faithful to their king, that in this matter, of such
importance, vvhereupon depends the preservation or subuertion, not only of
our authority but also of Christian Religion, the state, and them selves, that
they ouerrunne the said traitors and rebels, and assist us with their forces
and ability, and draw unto us upon our first summons, to punish all such as
will persist in their treasons, and to restore our authority together with our
estate into their former eminency and dignity to the honor ofGod, the
preservation of our Catholicque Apostolicque and Romish Religion and the relief
of our subjects, wherein we are resolved to employ what soever our means
together with our life. Also to the end none may pretend cause of ignorance
we have decreed and do decree that these presents be read and published, in
all our sovereign Courts and sease Royal, that are of the ressort of the
said Parliament: For such is our pleasure. In witness whereof, we have caused
our seal to be set and affixed hereto, that it may remain firm and steadfast
for ever.

Given at Bloys in the month of February the year of Grace. 1589. and of our
reign the 15. Thus signed HENRY, and underneath. By the King: Ruse, and sealed
with the great seal, with green wax upon red and green silk laces.
