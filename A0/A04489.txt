Read me and be not wroth
For I say no thing but trothe.
I will ascend making my state so hye /
That my pompous honor shall never dye.

O Caytyfe when thou thynkest least of all /
(...) confusion thou shall have a fall.
The descripcion of the arms.
Of the proud Cardinal this is the shield
Borne up between two angels off Satan.
The six blouddy axes in a bare field
Shows the cruelte of the red man /
which has devoured the beautiful swan.
Mortal enmy unto the white Lion /
Carter of Yorcke / the vile butchers son.
The six bulls heddes in a field black
Betokens his stordy furiousnes
Wherefore the godly light to put abacke
He brings in his dyvlisshe darcknes.
The bandog in the mids does express
The mastif Curre bred in Ypswitch town
Gnawynge with his teth a kings crown.
The cloubbe signifies plain his tyranny
Covered over with a Cardinals hatt
Wherein shall be fulfilled the prophecy
Arise up Jack and put on thy salatt /
For the time is come of bag and walatt
The temporal cheualry thus thrown down
Wherefore pressed take heed and beware thy crou^e.
To his singular good frendt and brother in Christ Master. D. G. N O. desires
grace and peace from God the father / through thelorde Jesus Christ.
BY your last letter / dear brother in Christ / I perceved / that your desire
was / to have the little work which ye sent / well examened / and diligently
put into prynt. Which thing (the bo^de of charity / Ioh. xv
where with not alonly you and I / but we with the whole nombre of Christis
chosen flock / remaynge among our nation of englisshe me^ / are knet
together / purly for the truths sake pondered) I could do no less but
fulfill and acco^plysshe. For as much as it is a thing so necessary. Where of
no doubt / shall spring grett fruit unto the fa^misshed / and light unto them
which of long season have been sore blyndfolded. Ma. xxv
Though the ra^mysshe resydue of gotes / so far re envred with man^is blind
reason (which repute grett felicite to make men beleve / good to be the
natural cause of evil / darkness to proceed out of light / and lyinge to be
grownded in troth / Mat. xxiiij.
and to make of the word of life the glave of death / contrary to all truth)

Whereby the way of truth (that is to say the glorious gospel of Christ) is
evil spocken of. In so much that they after this man^er sealed with the mark

I nevertheless with you / doing after the apostles erudicion / as long as I
follow no decevable fables / ij. Pe. jij
will not be negligent to put my brethren in remembrance (though they partly
know them their selves / and are stablysshed in the present truth) of those
things whereby they may the more evide^tly note the disceatfulnes of mortal
man / and the better come unto the knowledge of the im^ortall god. Seeing the
time at ho^de wherein god of his infinite mercy / Luc. j Romans j Ac. xiij Ebre.
iij mar. iij xvj lu. iiij.ix j. Io. v Lu. viij. Ma. vij
has ordened before to make them through Christ our lord part takers also
of his glorious will and porpos. eve^ as in the gospel our saveoure before to
all his hadd promesed. I therefore co^syderynge the world thus to be wrapped in
mysery and blindness (and now i^ these latter days become an hole or den of
falce foxy hipocrites / and a mancio^ for all ravenynge wolves disgysed in
lambs skynnes / which hate all love / and with out dread of god wander but
for their pray) have judged it a thing most convenie^t / to set this small
treatous as a glass or myroure most clear before all men's eyes. In the preface
where of manyfestly they shall perceave / how gretr danger now a days it is
/ the truth other to describe with pen / or with tongue to declare. Luc. vj
In the lamentacio^ following / made by a belly beast / engendered among the

calls a crooked / Ma. xvj xvij Luce. ix

and feel / where of our spretuall lords / masters / and rulars (falcely so
named) have proceeded / and are come. with what presomcion they disdain the
ancient and true noble blood. and what preemine^ce and dignite they have
obtained through their faulce and crafti bringing up of the blasphemous
mass / ma. xxiij
which principlally is their hold / stead / and defense. Forthermore in the
dialoge ensuynge or brefe interlude / is mas descrybed with his abominable
ministers. as Popes / Cardinals / bisshops / abbotes / montes / fryres / and
like wother. wherein also is declared whatt trees they are with their fruit. ma.
vij. epis. Iu.
annd what they shall remain their mass once disanulled / and putt down.
Which all well considered / I hoape that the reder what ever he be / will not
take this work as a thing convicious / or a principle of hatred and debate.
Romans ij
nor yett despise the riches of the godnes / and of the patience / of the long
soferance of god. but will remember that his kyndnes only leads him to
repentance. 1. Cor. ij
and mekely with the sprete of quyetnes / fyest judge it / and then co^sydre
him silfe. and fautlesse he shall find it a grett occasion / to love / and
also to tha^cke god his father most merciful / which of his tender mercy has
not delyvered him up unto a leawd mind / Romans j. Ioa. viij Romans ij

things which are not comely / full of all unrighteousness / fornication /
wickedness / covetousnes / maliciousnes. c. and sofered him not to become like
unto them / a hater of god / and of his godly word. against whose ungodliness
/ and unrighteousness / the wrath of the hevenly god apereth. because they with
hold the true righto^snes of god / Romans j
which comes throw the light of the gospel of Christ / in the
unrighteousness of man's laws and tradicions. Ye / and as says. S. paul / though
they know the rightousnes of god / how they which soche things co^mitt are
worthey of death / yett not only do the same / but also have pleasure in the
doars of them. Wherefore they are before god with out excuse. saying that
knowinge god / they glorify him not as god. nor yett are thanckfull. but were
full of vanities in their ymaginacions. countynge them selves wise where as
indede they are foles. For with their folysshe and blind heart / they turn
the glory of the immortal god / unto the similitude of the image of mortal
man. He shall lykwyse clearly perceve / that we of duty cold do no less / but
for the preservacio^ and tutell of the innocent and simple / to declare the
pestilent doblenes / and decevable seduccio^ of the wicked. acordi^ge to the

Wherefore dear brother / if any mo soche small sticks come unto your hondes /

The Author of the work. Go forth little treatous no thing a fraide.
To the Cardinal of Yorcke dedicate
And though he threate^ the be not dismayde
To pupplysshe his abominable estate
For though his power he does elevate
Yett the season is now verily come
Vt inveniatur iniquitas eius ad odium.

The Treatous. O my author how shall I be so bold
Before the Cardinal to show my face
Sei^ge all the clargy with him does hold /
Also in faveour of the Kyngis grace
With furious sentence they will me chase
Forbiddynge any person to read me
Wherefore my dear author it ca^nott be.

The Author. Thou know very well whatt his life is
Unto all people greatly detestable /
He causes many one to do amiss
Through his example abominable.
Wherefore it is nothing reprobable
To declare his mischefe and whordom
Vt inveniatur iniquitas cius ad odium.

The Treatous. Though his life of all people is hated
Yet in the mass they putt much co^fide^ce
Which through out all the world is dilated
As a work of singular magnificence /
Prestes also they have in reverence
With all wother persons of the spretualte
Wherefore my dear author it cannot be.

The Author. O dear treatous thou may not consider
Their blind affeccion in ignorance
Whereby all the world both far amd near
Has been combred with long co^tinua^ce
Itt is goddis will his truth to avaunce
And to putt antichrist out of his kingdom
Vt inveniatur iniquitas eius ad odium

The Treatous. Well yett there is great occasion of grudge
Be cause I apeare to be convicious.
Withouten fail the clargy will me judge
To proceed of a sprete presumtuous /
For to use soche words contumelious
It becomes not christen charity
Wherefore my dear author it cannot be.

The Author. O my treatous it is goddis judgment
So to recompense their mad blasphemy
Seeing they burned his holy testament
Through the proud cardinals tyranny
Against whose hard obstynacy to cry
The stones in the street cannot be dom
Vt inveniatur iniquitas eius ad odium.

The Treatous. If I presume to make relacion
Of secret matters that be uncertain
They will count it for diffamacion
Or things co^tryved of a froward brain
To descrybe their faults it is but vain
Except I were in some authorite
Wherefore my dear author it cannot be.

The Author. As touchi^g that thou need not to be deiecte
The truth shall be thy conservacion
Whiles thou presume no faults to detecte
But wheare thou have had certificacio^
By their knowledge and informacion
Which have forsaken the whore of rome
Vt inveniatur iniquitas eius ad odium.

The Treatous. Alas yett in their outrageous furoure
They shall coursse and ban^e with cruel se^te^ce
All those which have to me any favor
Either to my saying geve credence
In hell and heven they have preemine^ce
To do as they lift with free liberte
Wherefore my dear author it cannot be.

The Author. O treatous let antichrist cry and roar
Manassynge with fulminacions
His cruelte shall be feared no moare
Men knowing his abhominacions
Fie upon his forged execracions.
Seeing his tyranny is overcome
Vt inveniatur iniquitas eius ad odium.
Fie on his dyvlisshe interdiccions
With his keys lock chains and fetters
Fie upon all his iurisdiccions
And apo^ those which to him are detters
Fie upon his bulls breves and letters
Wherein he is named seruus servorum
Vt inveniatur iniquitas eius ad odium.
Fie on his golden three folded crown
Which he uses to wear apo^ his head
Fie upon his majesty and renown
Clayminge on earth to be in Christ stead
Fie on his carkes both quycke and dead
Exhoc nu^c et usque in seculum
Vt inveniatur iniquitas eius ad odium.
Blissed they be which are cursed of the pope
And coursed are they who^ he does bliss
A coursed are all they that have any hope
Either in his person or else in his.
For of almighty god a coursed he is
Per omnia secula seculorum
Vt inveniatur iniquitas cius ad odium.

Hear follows the lamentacion.
Alas alas for woo and bitter pain
Oppressed with grefe and sorofull care
How shall we from hevy weeping refrain
Considering the case that we in are.
We have now lost the price of our welfare
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Woe worth the time that ever we were born
To se the chance of this dolorours day
For now ar we mocked and laughed to skorn
Owre honor brought to extreme decay
We may well sing alas and well away
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Aproche proud patriark with your pope
Bisshops arsbysshops and Cardinals gaye
With all other prelat which had your hope
To be mayntayned by the mass all way
Who shall find our belly and rich array
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Draw nere ye pressed in your long gown
With all the fryres of the beggarly ordres
Com hither mo^k: with broad shave^ croun
And all soche as are shore^ above the ears /
Help me to lament with dolourous tears
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
The dolfull destruction of noble troy
Was never to man haulfe so lamentable
Nor yett the subversion of Rome our joy
Under who^ we were counted honorable.
O fortune fortune: thou art vnfauorable
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Departed is now the mass and clean gone
The chief vpholder of our liberte
Whereby our whores and harlot every chone
Were mayntayned in rich felicite.
Full sore we shall repent this day to se
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Our baud and brothels have lost there fiding
Our bastardes compelled to go astraye /
Our wynni^ge mill has lost her gryndi^ge
Which we supposed never to decay.
Alas therefore what shall we do or say
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Our gay velvet gown furred with sables
Which werre wont to keep us from cold
The paulfreys and hackeneis in our stables
Now to make chevesaunce must besolde
A due forked mitres and crosses of gold
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Weshall now abate our welthy tables
With delicate deyntyes so delicious
Our merry iestes vnd plesaunt fables
Are now turned to matters dolorous
We must lay down our estate so po^pous
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased alas alas.
Our fyngres shyni^ge with precious sto^s
Set in golden rings of rich valor
Our effeminate flesh and tender bones
Shall Be constrained to faule unto labor
For why decayed is all our honor
Seeing that gone is the mass.
Now deceased alas alas.
Where as we used upon mules to ride
Now must we needs prycke a fore a lone
Our wanta^ daliaunce and bosti^ge pride
With woeful misery is over gone.
Our glystri^ge gold is turned to a stone
Seeing that gone is the mass.
Now deceased alas alas.
We had our serva^tes in most courtly wise
In great multitude folowi^ge our tail
With guarded lyverey after the new gyse
Whom we freely supported to jest and rail
How be it now each from wother shall fail
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
Our poor kynred we little understood /
And of whatt vilnes our po^pe did arise.
We desdayned the estates of noble blood /
Nothing afraid our betters to despise.
Wherefore against us they will now surmyse
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
We were called lords and doctors revere^te /
Royally raignynge in the spretualte.
In every place wheare we were present /
They vayled their bonet and bowed a kne.
But it begins now wother wise to be.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
We devowred the sustenaunce of the poor /
Wasting the goods of people temporal.
Wherewith we norysshed many a whore /
To satisfye our pleasure beastiall.
And yett we were counted spretuall.
Under faveoure of the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
Our great lordspippes and dominacions /
With our rich iuelles and somptous plate.
Our places and large habitacions /
Adorned with hangyng and beds of state
From our hondes shall now be separate.
Seeing that gone is the mass
Now deceased / alas alas.
A due / our aid and supportacion /
Whereby fortune so merely did smyle.
Farwele comfort and consolacion /
Thus soddenly changed with in a while.
Our vain confydence did us fore begyle.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
By the mass we were exalted so hye /
That sca^tly any man we would once know.
We thought for to ascend unto the sky /
Havynge our seat above the rain bow
But we are come down again full low.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
The mass made us lord and king over all /
Far and nere every wheare havyng power.
With honorable tytles they did us call /
Gredynge to offend us at any hour.
The^ were we as fressh as the garden flower.
Under favor of the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
Among all the people we went a fore /
By pretense of our feigned holiness.
They reputed us for haulfe gods and more /
Through the masses beneficialnes.
Which is now turned to our hevines..
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
The mass was only our singular suffrage /
To delivre the people from their sin.
There was no pressed in town nor village /
But by the mass his lyvynge did win.
Whose superfluite shall be full thynne.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
O faithful mass / so constant and true.
In heven and earth continually.
We now thy children shall morn and rue /
The chance of thy dekaye so suddenly.
Constrained we are all to weep and cry.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
By the mass we had hye authorite /
In heven and earth taking our pleasure.
Kings and princes for all their dignite /
To displease us feared out of measure.
Alas we have now lost our chief treasure.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
The mass made us so strong and stordy /
That against hell gates we did prevayle.
Delyveringe souls out of purgatory /
And sendynge them to heven with out fail
Who is he then that would not bewail.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
Of all manner things the comodyte /
By the massis healpe only did depend.
From sycknes and pestilent mortalite /
The socoure of the mass did us defend.
All prosperity that our lord did send.
Was for favor of the mass
Now deceased / alas alas.
The mass far excedeth ma^nis reason /
Often times of foul wether making fair.
It causes fruit for to ripe in season /
Putting away infeccions of the air.
Great estates frendshippe stably to repair.
Have confirmacion by the mass
Now deceased / alas alas.
The mass in due time procures rain /
Whereby flowers and erbes freshly do spring.
And mass makes it forto seace again /
When it so abounds to their hyndrynge.
All manner matrymony and maryinge.
Is solemnysed by the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
To sondears and men going a war fare /
The mass is ever a sure proteccion.
It preserves people from woeful care /
Sryvynge away all affliccion.
Alas who can show by descripcion.
All the proffett of the mass /
Now deceased alas alas.
O woeful chance: most unfortunate /
So suddenly making comutacion.
Never sense the world was first create /
Was therea thing of soche reputacion.
For in every land and nation.
All goodness came by the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
Whatt avayleth now to have a shave^ hedde /
Or to be aparelled with a long gown.
Our anointed hondes do us little stedde /
Where as the mass is thus plucked dowue
Unto our dishonowre all does rebowne.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
The gooddes of the church are take away /
Geven to poor folks soffrynge indigence.
The devyne servyce utterly does decay /
With hallowed oil / salt / and frankynsence.
To holy water they have no reverence.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
All people because the mass is departed /
Seeks now / Ceremonies to confound.
The aultres of the lord are subverted /
With images which cost many a pound.
The temples also are throwe^ to the ground
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
Wherefore now of my lamentacion
To make an end with out delay.
Fare well O holy consecracion /
With blyssed sanctus and agnus dei.
No longer now with you we can pray.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now deceased / alas alas.
A due / gentle dominus vobiscum /
With comfortable / ite missa est.
Requiem eternam / is now undone /
By whom we had many a fest.
Requiescat in pace and good rest.
Seeing that gone is the mass /
Now decavsed / alas alas.
Here follows a brefe Dialoge between two prestes servaunt / named Warkyn. and
Ieffraye.
Watkyn IEffraye / hardest thou our master /
Thus with lamentable manner /
Most pitously complain:

Ieffraye Herd it catha? ye be throode /
I pray god turn it unto good /
That it be not to our pain.
But is it of a very surety /
As it is spoken in the country /
That the holy mass is dead.

Watt. Sead? ye Ieffraye by my hand /
And that thou might well understand /
Had thou any wit in thy head.
For the soroufull constraynte /
Of our masters complaynte /
Allonely for his deceace was.
Wherefore let us our counsel take /
What shyfte for us is best to make /
Seeing that deceaced is the mass.

Ief. Mary watkyne thou say very trothe /
We shall have but a cold brothe /
I fear me shortly after this.
But I pray the tell me now plain /
Was he by any myschaunce slain /
Or was it for age that he dead is.

Wat. Nay / it was not surly for age /
For he was of lusty courage /
Though he had very many years.
Also he had continued still /
If prestes might have had their will /
With the help of monks and fryres.
Butt he was assauted so sore /
That he could resist no more /
And was feign to geve over.
Then came his adversaries with might /
And slew him out of hand quyght /
As though he had been a faulce rover.

Ief. With what wepen did they him kill /
Whether with polaxe or with bill?
A good fellowship lightly tell.

Wat. Nay: with a sharp two edged sword /
Which as they say was goddis word /
Drawn out of the holy gospel.

Ief. And is goddis word of soche might /
That it slew the mass down right /
Of so ancient continuance?
My thinks it should not be true /
Seeing that prestes would him rescue /
With worldly riches and substance.
Montes / channons / all shaven crowns /
Would have brought their villag and tounes /
With their whole religious rabble.
Which under antichristis raygne /
Are of sects variable and vain /
Forto be reckcned in numerable.
Our master also I dare say /
With many wother prestes gaye /
Whom I know very well.
Would have spent all their good.
Ye verily their own heart blood /
To help mass against the gospel.

Wat. Tosshe man they did all their best /
Not sparynge to opyn their chest /
Gevynge out brybes liberally.
Whereby they had great confidence /
For to have done much assistence /
In aid of the mass certainly.
But it provayled them nothing /
For goddis word has soche workynge /
That none may resist contrary.

Ief. Well / yet take it for no scorn /
I tell the wheare as I was borne /
They resist the gospel openly.
And the principal doars be such /
As now a days govern the church /
No small foles I promise the.
And namly one that is the chief /
Which is not fedd / so often with roast befe /
As with raw motten so god help me.
Whose mule if it should be sold /
So gayly trapped with velvet and gold /
And geven to us for our schare.
I durst ensure the one thing /
As for a competent lyvynge /
This seven year we should not care.

Wat. If he be soche what is his name /
Or of what regard is his fame?
I beseech the shortly express.

Ief. Mary / some men call him Carnal /
And some say he is the devil and all /
Patriarcke of all wickedness.

Wat. Well / to be brefe with outen gloss /
And not to swarve from our purpose /
Take good head what I shall say.
The time will come or it belong /
When thou shall se their statly thronge /
With miserable ruin decay.
Note well the ensample of Rome /
To what misery it is come /
Which was their hedde principal.
Goddis word the grownde of virtue /
They went about for to subdue /
Werby they have gotten a faule.

Ief. Beleve me / thou speak reason /
I trow we shall se a season /
To the confusion of them all.
But now to our matter again /
I would hear mervelously feign /
In what place the mass deceased.

Wat. In Strasbrugh / that noble town /
A Cite of most famous renown /
Wheare the gospel is freely preached.

Ief. And what do thou their names call /
Which were counted in especial /
The adversaries of the mass?

Wat. Truly there where clerks many one /
And greatly learned every chone /
Whose names my memory do pass.
How be it / Hedius / Bu^er. and Capito /
Celarius / Symphorian / and mother mo /
In deed were reputed the chief.
Whose living is so inculpable /
That their enemies with out fable /
In them could find no reprefe.

Ief. What did then the temporalte /
Would they all there unto agree /
With outen any dissencion?

Watt. As for the co^mens universally /
And a great part of the senatory /
Were of the same intencion.
Though a feawe were on the mother side /
But they were lightly satissyed /
When they could not goddis word denaye

Ief. I perceive then manifestly /
The bisshoppe with his whole clargy /
Were absent and a way.

Wat. They were not absent I the ensure /
For with the mass they did endure /
Whyls to speak they had any breath.
In somoche that for all this /
The bisshoppe cease not with his /
To revenge the masses death.
He spares not to course and banne /
Doing all that ever he can /
To revoke mass unto life again.
He spends many a gulden /
To hang / morther / and bren /
The masses adversaries certain.

Ief. And gets he any good thereby?

Wat. But littell yet I the certefy /
And I trow less he shall have.
Now for all his hye magnificence /
They count him savynge reverence /
Not much better than a knave.

Ief. Peace whorsone / beware of that /
I tell the his skin is consecrat /
Anointed with holy oyntmente.

Wat. Ye / so many a knaves skin /
Is gresyd with out and with in /
And yett they are not excellent

Ief. Cocks bones / this is rank heresy /
If it were knwone: by and by /
Thou should a faggote bear.
To speak so of soche a prelate /
Whiles they are all of the same rate /
For the more part every wheare.
But to the purpose that we began /
What did monks and fryeres thanne /
When mass went thus to wrack?

Wat. So uttered was their abusione /
That with great confusione /
They were feign to stand abacke.

Ief. Och: I know a friar in a place /
Whom they call father Matthias /
If he had been at this brayde.
He would have made soche a noise /
With his horrible shrill voice /
Able to have made them afraid.

Wat. Tosshe / there were fryres two or three /
In faith as grett panched as he /
With bellies more then a barell.
Which for all their learned strength /
Were so confounded there at length /
That they gave over their quarrel.

Ief. What made Ihon Faber and Emser /
With their ayders Eckyus and Morner /
Did they unto mass no socoure?

Wat. Yes truly / with words of great boste /
They spared not to send their oste /
Threatnynge with fearful terroure.
How be it they had soche impediment /
That they could not be there present /
As thou shall the case understand.
Emser sometime a reguler chanon /
To defend the massis cannon /
Long before had taken in hand.
Which craftily to uphold with lies /
So grevously troubled his eyes /
And also encombred his brain.
That there was no remedy /
But he was feign certainly /
At home / a fool to remain.
Flattering Faber / full of disdain /
Was new admitted to be chaplayne /
Unto duke Ferdinand by oath.
Wherefore he had enough of busynes /
To dissuade the dukes noblenes /
From favourynge the godly trothe.
As for Morner / the blind lawear /
And Ectius / the froward sophistrar /
They have before casting wisdom.
That in soche honorable audience /
Wheare as wise clarctes are in presence /
They will not very gladly come.

Ief. Meddled not Erasmus / in this matter
Which so craftily can flatter /
With cloked dissimulacion?

Wat. He was busy to make will fre /
A thing not possible to be /
After wise clarckis estimacion.
Wherefore he intermitted little /
As concerning the massis title /
With any manner assercion.
He fears greatly some men say /
If mass should utterly decay /
Least he should lose his pension.
Notwithstondynge he has in his hedde /
Soche an opinion of the god of bredde /
That he would lever dye a marter.
Then ever he would be of this consent /
That christ is not theare corporally present /
In bredde wine and water.
Also he has geven soche a landacion /
Unto the ydols of abhominacion /
In his glosynge pistles before time.
That if he fhulde wother wise reclame /
Men would impute unto his blame
Of unstable inconstancy the crime.

Ief. How did they then with lovayne /
And with the university of Colayne /
Made they right noght for massis part?

Wat. Yes surly with terrible vociferacion /
They made wonderful exclamacion /
The word of god to subverte.
They sent thither Thomas and Scote /
With wother questionistes god wot.
Full of crakynge words inopinable.
But when it came to the effect /
They were so abashed and deiecte /
That once to hiss they were nottable.

Ief. It was a thing plainly acorst /
That mass went thus by the worst /
Havynge so many on his wynge.

Wat. Goddis word is so efficacious /
And of strength so mervelous /
That against it is no resistynge.

Ief. Nevertheless among this array /
Was not theare one called Coclaye /
A littell pratye foolysshe poade?
But all though his stature be small.
Yett men say he lacks no gall /
More venomous than any toade.
No / for he had a another occupacyon /

Wat. Wrytinge to the english nacyon /
Inuencyones of flatterye.

Ief. To England? in good time /
I trow the vichyn will clyme /
To some promocion hastily.

Wat. Or else truly it shall cost him a fall /
For he is in favor with them all /
Which have the gospel in hate.
Continually he does write /
Ever laboring day and night /
To uphold antichrists estate.
Of papists he is the defender /
And of Luther the condemner /
The gospel utterly despysynge.
To forge lies he has no shame /
So that they somewhat frame /
With the process of his writynge.
He wrote of late to Herman Ryncke /
Wasting in vain paper and yncke /
Pomeranes epistle to corrupt.
Which by christen men required /
According as he was desired /
Did his part them to instruct.
No thing there in was reprobable /
But all to gedder true and veritable /
With out heresy or any fault.
How be it this wretch unshamefast /
Through malicie was not a gast /
The truth with lies to assault.

Ief. If he be as thou say he is /
I warant he shall not mis /
Of a benefice and that shortly.
For I ensure the our Cardinal /
With wother bisshops in general /
Love soche a fellow entierly
But let this now pass and go to /
What is best for our proffit to do /
Seeing mass has made his end?

Wat. Surely as far as I can guess /
We are like to be masterlesse /
Yerre it be long so god me mende.
For as soon as the mass is buried /
Our master shall be beggered /
Of all his rich possession

Ief. Then mate I put the out of doubt /
It is good that we look about /
Least we solfe a new lesson.
How be it / how long will it be /
Or ever that we shall se /
Of this dedde mass the burial?
As touching that in very deed /

Wat. They are not yett fully agrede /
But I suppose shortly they shall /
Some would have him carried to Rome /
For be cause of all christendom /
It is the principal Ce.
And some would have him to France /
Because of the noble mayntenaunce /
That he had of Paris vniversite.
Some also persuade in good ernest /
That in England it were best /
His dedde cors rychly to begraue

Ief. Now after my folysshe conjecture /
They could not for his sepulture /
Devyse / a better place to have.
Also theare is Sayncte Thomas schryne /
Of precious stones and gold fine /
Wherein the mass they may lay.
Whereof the riches incomprehensible /
As it is spoken by persons credible /
Might an Emperors ransom pay.
Morover theare is the Cardinal /
Of whose pomp to make rehearceall /
It passes my capacite.
With stately bissoppes a great sort /
Which keep a mervelous port /
Concerning worldely royalte.
Prestes also that are seculer /
With monks and chanons reguler.
Abownde so in possession.
That both in welfare and wede /
With out doubt they far excede /
The nobles of the region.

Wat. If it be thus as thou do declare /
It is best that mass be buried theare /
With due honorable reverence.

Ief. Ye but they have a froward wit /
And par case they will not admit /
But utterly make resistance?

Wat. Hold thy peace and be content /
The gospel by a co^maundment /
To do it will strayghtly them compel.

Ief. They set not by the gospel a fly /
Did thou not hear whatt villainy /
Thy did unto the gospel?

Wat. Why / did they against him conspyre?

Ief. By my trothe they set him a fire /
Openly in London cite.

Wat. Who caused it so to be done?

Ief. In sothe the Bisshoppe of London /
With the Cardinal authorite.
Which at Paulis cross ernestly /
Denounced it to be heresy /
That the gospel should come to light.
Calling them heretics excecrable /
Which caused the gospel venerable /
To come unto lay men's sight.
He declared there in his furiousnes /
That he fownde erroures more and les /
Above three thousand in the translacion.
How be it when all came to pas /
I dare say unable he was /
Of one error to make probacion.
Alas he said / masters and friends /
Consider well now in your minds /
These heretik diligently.
They say that common women /
Shall as soon come unto heven /
As those that lyve perfectly.

Wat. And was that their very saying?

Ief. After this wise with out faynynge /
In a certain prologe they write.
That a who are or an open sinner /
By means of Christ our redemer /
Whom god to repent does incyte.
Shall sooner come to salvation /
By merit of Christis passion /
Then an ouwtarde holy lyver.

Wat. They did there none wother thing show /
Then is rehearced in mathewe /
In the one and twenty chapter.

Ief. For all that / he said in his sermon /
Rather then the gospel should be comone /
Bryngyng people into error
He would gladly soffre marterdome /
To uphold the devyls fredome /
Of whom he is a confessoure.

Watt. Why / make thou him a saint?

Ief. Even soche a one as paynters do paynt /
On walls and bordes artificially.
Which with myters / crosses / and copes /
Apere like gaye bisshops and popes /
In strawnge fassion outwardly.
But they are ydols in effect /
Mamett of antichristis sect /
To blind folk deceatfully.

Wat. I perceave well now that / honores /
As it is spoken / mutant mores /
With soche men most commonly.
But thynkest thou in thy mind /
That he could in his heart find /
In soche a case death to souffer /

Ief. Nay / yt was a word of office /
I warante he is not so folisshe /
To putt his boddy so in danger.
Nevertheless with tongue and porsse /
All though he should fare the worsse /
Gladly he will do his dever.
To pluck the word of god down
And to exalte the three fold crown
Of antichrist his bever.
Also there is a charge under pain /
That no man any thing retain /
Of the gospel newly translate.
For if they presume the contrary /
They lose their goods with out mercy /
And their boddies to be incarcerate.
Morover that no clarcke be so bold /
Prevy or pearte / with him to hold /
Preaching ought in his favor.
But contrary their brains to set /
Both in scoles and in the pulpett /
Him and all his to dishonor.
Wherefore it boteth the gospel nothing
As concerning the massis buryinge /
To send any precepte thither.
For they had lever by this day /
Go unto the devil straight way /
Then to obey him in any manner.

Wat. This passes of all that ever I heard /
I wonder they were not a fearde /
Of so notable blasphemy.
Not with stondynge their interrupcion /
Shall turn to their destruction /
At long runnynge finally.
For though they caused to be brent /
The outward shaddowe or garment /
Of goddis word so hye of price.
Yett the grownde of his majesty /
Printed in christen hertes sceretly /
They are not able to preiudyce.
Therefore whyther they will or nill /
If it be the holy gospels will /
Mass in England to bury.
Let them crake until they burst /
Doing their best and their wurst /
Itt avayleth not a chery.
They are worldly and carnal /
And the gospel is spretuall /
Assisted with angels presence.

Ief. If it come unto that reckenynge /
They will mo angels with them bring /
Then shall be in the gospels assistence.

Wat. Have they of angels any garnyson?

Ief. Ye god knows many a legion /
At all times them to socoure.

Wat. How do they these angels get?

Ief. By my faith of poor men's swett /
Which for them sore do labor.

Wat. Aha / I wott well what thou mean /
Soche angels are not worth a bean /
If it come to the point once.
But now would I hear the express /
The manner of their holiness /
Brefly declared at tonce.

Ief. Mary that is done forth with all /
For they have no holiness attall /
As far as I saw yett ever.
How be it shortly to discousse /
Their proud estate so glorious /
I shall here my self endever.
First as I said there is a Cardinal /
Which is the Ruler principal /
Through the realm in every part.

Wat. Have they not in England a King?

Ieff. Alas man^e / speak not of that thing /
For it goes to my very heart.
And I shall show the a cause why /
There is no Prince under the sky /
That to compare with him is able.
A goodly person he is of stature /
Endued with all gifts of nature /
And of genttylnes incomparable.
In sondrye sciences he is seen /
Havynge a lady to his Qwene /
Example of womanlye behaveoure.
Notwithstanding for all this /
By the Cardinal ruled he is /
To the distayninge of his honor.

Wat. Soeth he follow the Cardinales intent?

Ief. Ye / and that the co^mones repent /
With many a weeping tear.

Wat. The Cardinal vexes them than?

Ief. Alas sens England first began /
Was never soche a tyrante theare.
By his pride and faulce treachery /
Whoardom and baudy leachery /
He has been so intolerable.
That poor co^mens with their wyves /
In manner are weary of their lyves /
To se the land so miserable.
Through all the land he caused perjury /
And afterward took away their money /
Procedynge most tyrannously.
The poor people nedy and bare /
His cruel heart would not spare /
Leavynge them in great misery.
Insomoche that for lack of fode /
Creatures bought with Christis blood
Were feign to dye in petous cas
Also a right noble Prince of fame /
Henry the ducke of buckyngame /
He caused to deye alas alas.
The goods that he thus gaddered /
Wretchedly he has scattered /
In causes nothing expedient.
To make wyndowes / walls / and doors /
And to maintain baudes and whores /
A grett part thereof is spent.

Wat. Let all this pas I pray the hertely /
And show me somewhat seriously /
Of his spretuall magnificence.

Ief. First he has a title of. S. Cecile /
And is a Legate of latere /
A dignite of hye premynence.
He has bisshopryckes two or three /
With the popes full authorite /
In cases of dispensacion.

Wat. He may then with the mass dispense /
If he be faulen in the sentence /
Of the grett exco^municacion?

Ief. That he may in all manner cases /
How be it he geveth nothing grates
But sells all for reddy money.
Except courses and blessings
With sight of his golden rings
All this he geveth freely.

Wat. Has he so large faculte /
Of the popis benygnite /
As it is spoken abroad?

Ief. He stondeth in the popes room /
Havynge of his bulls a grett some /
I trow an whoale carte load.
Wherewith men's porses to descharge /
He extends his power more large /
Then the power of almygthy god.
For whether it be good or ill /
His pervers mind he will fulfill /
Supplantynge the truth by falshod.
To get him a synguler name /
The land he brings out of frame /
Against all goddis forbod.
He tourneth all thing topsy tervy /
Not sparynge for any symony /
To sell spretuall gifts.
In grauntes of consanguinite /
To mary with in near degree /
He gets away men's thryftes.
Of seculer folk he can make reguler /
And again of reguler seculer /
Making as he list black of white.
Open whordom and advoutry /
He aloweth to be matrimony /
Though it be never so unright.
Laufull wedlock to divorce /
He geveth very little force /
Knowing no cause wherefore.
He plays the devil and his dame /
All people reportynge the same /
Coursse the time that ever he was bore.

Wat. It cannot syncke in my mind /
That the Cardinal is so blind /
To make any soche diuorcement.

Ief. Though it be not in thy belefe /
I tell the to putt it in prefe /
He does all that he can invent.

Wat. Bitwixte whom do thou wene?

Ief. Bitwxite the King and the Queen /
Which have been long of one assent.

Wat. Some cause then he has espied /
Which asonder them to devyde /
Is necessary and urgent.

Ief. Nothing but the butcher does feign /
That the good lady is barayne /
Like to be past child bearing.

Wat. Had the king never child by her?

Ief. No man saw ever goodlyer /
Then those which she forth did bring.

Wat. Is there any of them a lyve?

Ief. Ye a Princes / whom to descryve /
It were herd fo an oratoure.
She is but a child of age /
And yett is she both wise and sage /
Of very beautiful faveoure.
Perfectly she does represent /
The singular graces excellent /
Both of father and mother.
How be it all this not regarding /
They carter of orcke is meddelynge /
Forto divorce them a sonder.

Watt. Are not the nobles here with offended?

Wat. Yes / but it can not be amended /
As long as he is the ruler.

Wat. I think the Queen is not faulty /
But has done enough of her party /
If it had pleased goddis benificence.

Ief. None is faulty but the butcher /
Whom almighty god does suffer /
To scourge the peoples offense.
Unto god he is so odious /
That nothing can be prosperous /
Where as he has governaunce.
Sens that he came first forward /
All things have gone backwarde /
With much myschefe and mischaunce.
No yerly purpose he does intend /
That ever comes to a good end /
But damage and tribulacion.

Wat. In these parties it is verifyed /
That he has a college edified /
Of mervelous foundation.

Ief. Of preuy houses of baudry /
He has made a stues openly /
Endued with large exibicion.

Wat. Lycknest thou to whoarmongers /
A colage of clerks and scolears /
Ensuynge learned erudicion.

Ief. Thou may perceave / by reason /
That virtue shall be very geason /
Among a sort of idle losels.
Which have riches infinite /
In wealth and worldly delight /
Geven to pleasure and nothing eles.

Wat. They read there both greek and ebrue /

Ief. I will not say but it is true /
That there be men of grett science.
How be it where pride is the beginning.
The devil is commonly the ending /
As we se by experience.
And if thou consider well /
Even as the tower of Babell /
Began of a presompcion.
So this college I dare undertake /
Which the Cardinal does make /
Shall confunde the region.
What is it to se dogs and cattes /
Gargell heddes and Cardinal hattes /
Painted on walls with much cost.
Which ought of dute to be spent /
Upon poor people indigent /
For lack of fode utterly lost.

Wat. Has he for soche folk no providence?

Ief. No / savynge only to rid them hence /
A proper way he ymageneth.

Wat. After what manner porviaunce?

Ief. Truly least they should be co^braunce /
A warfare he them sends.

Wat. Many of them then are slain?

Ief. They never come home haulfe again /
I may tell the in good plyght.
For some be taken presoners /
And some are dedde of the fevers /
Many of them losing their sight.
Of twenty thousand fighting men /
Scant returns home again ten /
In good state and perfect liking.
For the more part made beggars /
And so become robbers and stelers /
Whereby they have a shroade ending.

Wat. He fares not the better for war /

Ief. Yes mary / it does him prefarre /
To more gaynes then I can rehearce.
For first or the war do begin /
They labor his favor to win /
Gevynge gifts many and dyvers.
And if it cannot be so pacifyed /
They brybe him on the wother side /
At the least for to be favored.
And finally war for to ceace /
With rewards they must him grease /
Or else peace cannot be performed.

Wat. Sothe he practyse soche conveyaunce?

Ief. Ye / and for that cause in France /
This war time he was beloved.

Wat. Thou make him then a trayter?

Ief. I reckon him a falce fayterer /
If the very truth were proved.

Wat. Well let this pas / how does he /
In gevynge grauntes of liberte /
And cases that be dispensable?

Ief. He follows the common practyse /
Of marchantes in their marchandyse /
To get worldly goods movable.
Savynge they take grett labors /
And he does all by his factoures /
Resting in quiet felicite.
He has falce farises and scrybes /
Gapynge for nothing but for brybes /
Full of frauds and perversite.

Wat. They are named yett wother wise /

Ief. Trothe / but they follow their gyse /
In wicked operacions.

Wat. I put a case now they be lewd /
As I thyncke they are all be shrewde /
In their administracions /
Shall they to hell for the Cardinal /
Or else thynkest thou that he shall /
Go thither in his own person?

Ief. Though he have here soche prerogative /
In all points that be dispensative /
To perform it by co^myssion.
Yett in this point sekerly /
He must perform it personally /
Without any exempcion.

Wat. If he be as thou have here said /
I wene the devils will be afraid /
To have him as a companion.
For what with his execracions /
And with his terrible fulminacions /
He would handle them so.
That for very dread and fear /
All the devils that be theare /
Will Be glad to let him go.

Ief. As for that thou may be assured /
The devils with coursses are invred /
As authors there of with out fail.

Wat. What if he will the devils bliss?

Ief. They regard it no more be gisse /
Then waggynge of his mules tail.

Wat. Soth he use then on mules to ride?

Ief. Ye and that with so shamfull pride /
That to tell it is not possible.
More like a god celestial /
Then any creature mortal /
With worldly pomp incredible.
Before him rydeth two prestes strong /
And they bear two crosses right long /
Gapynge in every man's face.
After them follow two lay men secular /
And each of them holding a pillar /
In their hondes / stead of a mace.
Then follows my lord on his mule /
Trapped with gold under her cule /
In every point most curiously.
On each side a pollaxe is borne /
Which in none wother use are worn.
Pretendynge some hid mystery.
Then has he servaunt fyve or six score /
Some behind and some before /
A marvelous great company.
Of which / are lords and gentlemen /
With many gromes and yemen /
And also knaves among.
Thus daily he proceeds forth /
And men must take it at worth /
Whether he do right or wrong.
A grett carle he is and a fatt /
Wearynge on his head a red hatt /
Procured with angels subsidy.
And as they say in time of rain /
Four of his gentelmen are feign /
To hold over it a cannopy.
Beside this to tell the more news /
He has a pair of costly shows /
Which sildom touch any grownde.
They are so goodly and curious /
All of gold and stones precious.
Costynge many a thousand pownde.

Wat. And who did for these shows pay?

Ief. Truly many a rich abbaye /
To be easied of his visitacion.

Wat. Does he in his own person visit?

Ief. No / another for him does it /
That can skyll of the occupacion.
A fellow nether wise nor sad /
But he was never yett full mad /
Though he be frantyke and more.
Doctor Alyn he is named /
One that to lie is not asshamed /
If he spy avauntage therefore.

Wat. Are soche with him in any price?

Ief. Ye / for they do all his advyce /
Whether it be wrong or right.

Wat. Has the Cardinal any gay mansion?

Ief. Grett palaces with out compareson /
Most glorious of outward sight.
And with in decked point device /
More like unto a paradise /
Then an erthely habitacion.

Wat. He comes then of some noble stock?

Ief. His father could snatche a bullock /
A butcher by his occupacion.

Wat. How came he unto this glory?

Ief. Plainly by the devils policy /
As it is every wheare said.

Wat. Are the states here with all content.

Ief. If they speak aught they are shent /
Wherefore I tell the they are a frayde.

Wat. Whatt abstinence uses he to take?

Ief. In Lent all fysshe he does forsake /
Fed with partriges and plovers.

Wat. He leads then a Lutherans life?

Ief. O nay / for he has no wife /
But whoares that be his lovers.

Wat. If he use whoares to occupy /
It is grett marvel certainly /
That he escapes the french pockes.

Ief. He had the pockes with out fail /
Wherefore people on him did rail /
With many obprobrious mockes.

Wat. He was then abhorred of his prince:

Ief. By my troth man / not an ynche /
Still in favor continually.

Wat. By the devil then he works?

Ief. Truly so every man judges.
But alas what remedy?

Wat. Has he children by his whoares also?

Ief. Ye and that full prowdly they go /
Namly one whom I do know.
Which has of the churches goods clerly /
More then two thousand pownde yerly /
And yett is not content I trow.
His name is master Winter /
For whom my lord his father /
Has gotten of the french kings grace.
That when the bishop of Rone /
Out of this life is dedde and gone /
He shall succeed him in his place.

Wat. And is his father as ready /
To promoute the noble progeny /
As he is toward his bastardes?

Ief. He favors little noble lynage /
Taking a way their heritage /
Rather then to set them forwards.
He breaks men's testamentes /
And contrary to their intentes /
At his own mind and pleasure.
He will be needs their exsecutours /
Saying with the devil all his ours /
Rychely to encreace his treasoure.
Many a good ladys ioynter /
He engroseth up into his cofer /
Of the which some here to name.
I reckon the Countes of Sarby /
With the Countes of Salsbury /
Also the Duches of Buckyngame.

Wat. Is the devil soche an whorsone?

Ief. Och / there is nether duke ne barone /
Be they never of so grett power.
But they are constrained to croutche /
Before this butcherly sloutche /
As it were unto an Emproure.

Wat. Now surly then after my mind /
They cannot soche another find /
The dedde massis office to solempnise.

Ief. If it be his pleasure he may /
How be it he uses little to pray /
For it is late or he do arise.
Also as far as I can muse /
To do this office he will refuse /
Dredynge his pomp thereby to lose.

Wat. As for that / it shall nothing skyll /
Plainly if it be the gospels will /
Do it he must and cannot chose.

Ief. Yett it will be a parelous business /
For bisshops and prestes doutles /
To aid him will not be slack.
Though they love him as the devil /
Yett to do the gospel some evil /
No diligence in them shall lack.

Wat. Have the bisshops so grett riches?

Ief. It is not possible to expres /
The treasure of the spretualte.

Wat. What / are the bisshops divines?

Ief. Ye they can well skyll of wynes /
Better then of devinite.
Lawears they are of experience /
And in cases against conscience /
They are parfet by practyse.
To forge excommunicacions /
For tithes and decimacions /
Is their continual exercise.
As for preaching they take no care /
They would se a course at an hare /
Rather then to make a sermon.
To follow the chase of wild dear /
Passing the time with ioly chere /
Among them all is common.
To play at the cards and dyce /
Some of them are nothing nyce /
Both at hasard and momchaunce.
They drink in gaye golden bolles /
The bloudde of poor simple souls /
Perisshynge for lack of sustenaunce.
Their hongery cures they never teach /
Nor will soffre none wother to preach /
But soche as can lie and flatter.
Biddynge the beads after this rate /
Ye shall pray for the good estate /
Of my lord my master.
And so redynge a ragge man's roll /
He exhorts to pray for the soul /
Of this person and of that.
Which gave book / bell / or challes /
To the fortheraunce of goddis serves /
Babblynge he wotteth near what.
Soche preachers be commended /
And the wother are reprehended /
Which preach the gospel purly.
So they sit upon cousshens soft /
Their royalte exalted alofte /
They regard not goddis word surly.
They are so geven to avaryce /
That they ponder no preiudyce /
Happenynge to the comen weall.
They norysshe servauntes in ydelnes /
Which when they are masterles /
Are constrained to beg or steal.
To tell all the abhominacion /
Of their wretched conversation /
It were both long and tedious.

Wat. If the bisshops do so abownde /
How are seculer prestes fownde /
With persons which be religious?

Ief. Thynkest that with them it is scant /
Nay nay man / I the warant /
They feel no indigent rearage.
For they have goods innumerable /
And fare much better at their table /
Then lords of worthy parage.
Fortune with prestes runs on wheles /
So that some have after their heles /
A scoare of yemen taule and stout.
Whom forto maintain ydely /
They have benefyces very many /
In the country there about.
Whereby they are so proud and vain /
That the noble men they disdain /
With scornful indignacion.
Though peraventure their fathers /
Were other sowters or cobblers /
Of no manner reputacion.
As for religious folk to be brefe /
In all England they have the chief /
And most plesaunt co^moditees.
The goodly soyles / the goodly lands /
Wrongfully they hold in their hondes /
Endued with many knights fees.
By color of their faulce prayres /
Defrauded are the right heirs /
From their true inheritance.
They are the cause of mysery /
Of whordom / theft / and beggary /
To the common wells hynderaunce.
No frutfull work they use /
All honest labor they refuse /
Geven wholly to sluggesshnes.
They are nether gostly nor divine /
But like to brut beasts and swyne /
Waltrynge in sinful wretchedness.
I speak this of the possessioners /
All though the mendicant orders /
Are nothing less abominable.
Whose lyvynge is with out laud /
Norisshed in rapyne and fraud /
Grounded on lesyng detestable.
They are the devils messengers /
And of antichrist the members /
Example of all perversite.
They are ydols of flattery /
And apostels of hypocrysy /
Replenisshed with enormite.
Lo / here I have thus reported /
How their life is partly ordered /
And under what condition.

Wat. That thou have I make god a vow /
Insomoche that I marvayle how /
Thou know their disposicion.
But I pray the / do thou judge /
That they will murmer and grudge /
At the dedde massis buryinge?

Ief. Ye sir I wis man I am sure /
They will labor with busy cure /
His sepulture forbiddynge.
For why their superfluite /
By the massis liberalite /
Only has supportacion.

Wat. What supposest thou of men temporal?

Ief. I think they would hold here with all /
If they had due informacion.
Nevertheless at the begyn^ynge /
deed mass among them to bring /
There will be some difficulte.
Be cause of long continuance /
They have had trust and affiaunce /
Through the mass saved to be.
For these prestes and fryres persuade /
That by the mass they shall evade /
Eternal pain and punnysshment.
Whose suffrage does them great stedde /
Proffitable both to quick and dedde /
After their mind and judgment.

Wat. Ye to prestes and friars miserable /
Doutles the mass is proffitable /
And is the mill of their welfare.
But to the people without faynynge /
It is plain a fraudfull deceavynge /
To make their porsse empty and bare.
Now truly I trow as thou do say /

Ief. Even there goes the hare quyte away /
And all their babellynge is but lies.
All though there be wother obstacles /
Be cause of the grett miracles /
Daily practysed before our eyes.

Wat. Thou never saw miracle wrought?

Ief. I / no be him that me bought /
But as the prestes make rehearceall.

Wat. Can thou rehears me now one?

Ief. No I cannot / but our sir Ihon
Can / in his Enghlisshe festival.

Wat. Geve they to soche fables credence?

Ief. They have them in more reverence /
Then the gospel a thousand fold.
Also there is nether whoare nor thief /
Nor any of so wicked mischefe /
But by the mass is made bold.
For if they hear once a prestis mass /
They trust surly that day to pass /
Without all parell or daungeoure.
Crafty sorcerers and falce dyce players /
Pickeporses and prevy conveyers /
By the mass hope to have socoure.
Marchantes passing viages on far /
And soudiars going forth to war /
By the mass are often preserved.
Mass brings sinners to grace /
And fendes away it does chase /
Above all things preferred.
Mass solemniseth marriage /
And keeps people from damage /
Causynge also wedder to be fayer.
Mass makes tame things of wild /
And helps women to be with child /
Through assistence of the sayer.
Mass avayleth against sycknes /
A proved remedy for all distres /
And for things that be gone.
Thus to conclude with brevite /
Of the whole churches felicite /
The mass is mayntener alone.

Wat. The nobles that be wise and sage /
I suppose with soche blind dotage /
They cannot so folisshly begyle.

Ief. Troth it is / some of them begin /
To have little confidence there in /
And less woll with in a while.
Which of the bisshops is perceaved /
Wherefore they have now restrained /
Under the pain of courssynge.
That no lay man do read or look /
In any frutfull englisshe book /
Wholly scripture coucernynge.
Their frantyke folly is so pevisshe /
That they contempne in Englisshe /
To have the new Testament.
But as for tales of Robyn hode /
With wother iestes nether honest nor good /
They have none impediment.
Their mad vnsavery teachynges /
And their fantastical preachynges /
Among simple folk to promote.
For no cost they spare nor stynte /
Openly to put them in prynte /
Treading scripture under their foot.
Also their decrees and decretall /
With folysshe dreams papisticall /
They compel people to read.
How be it the confutacion /
Of their abhominacion /
They will not softre to proceed.

Wat. Keep thou silence and be whyst /
Though with grett crakes they resist /
For a little season present.
Yett I warant within shortt space /
Mass will have there his beryinge place /
Acordynge as it is convenient.

Ief. So much the worse for our thryfte /
For then there is none wother shyfte /
A new master we must us get.

Wat. All though mass be dedde and rotten /
A master may lightly be gotten /
If we our mind to labor set.

Ief. Ye but prestes service is gaye /
For we may with them all way /
In ydelnes have grett respyt.

Wat. That for a christen man is not best /
Borne unto labor and not unto rest /
As the foul is unto flight.
But now all this matter to spare /
Let us our masters dinner prepare /
For it is hye time verily.

Ief. A felyship let us go a pace /
For he will beshrowe our face /
If he find not all thing ready.

Wat. Hawe / I pray the yett abide /
Set thy busynes a while a side /
And let us have first a song.

Ief. What would thou that I should sing?

Wat. Surly some propper conveyed thing
Not over tedious nor long.

Ief. I trow thou art a singing man?
The devil of the whit that I can /
But I love specially soche gear.

Ief. Will thou have it merry or sad?

Wat. I foarce not be it good or badde /
So that I may some what hear /

Ief. If thou will thy mind satisfy /
Get the into some monastery /
And be a monge them in the queare.

Wat. Do they use soche ioly singing?

Ief. It is the craft of their lyvynge /
Whereby they make lusty cheer.

Wat. But I understand not what they say /

Ief. By my sothe no more do they /
I may show the in counsel.

Wat. Shall I axe the now a question?

Ief. Ye hardely a goddis beneson /
And I will not spare the to tell.

Wat. Ware thou never in religion?

Ief. Yes so gdd help me and halydom /
A dosen years continually.

Wat. Then thou know much unhappiness?

Ief. A grett deal more then goodness /
I promise the faithfully.

Wat. Well let us differ this till soune /
When our masters diner is done /
We will a gain come hydder.

Ief. I am content even so to do /

Wat. First sing a balett / go to /
And then will we to diner.

Ief. Alas I am marvelously dry /

Wat. Thou shall drink man by an by /
What needs the so to linger?

Ief. Have at it in the best manner.
In the joyful month of ioly June /
Walking all alone my care to solas.
I herd a voice with a dolorous tune /
Full pitiously cryinge / alas alas.
The world is worsse then evyr it was.
Never so deep in miserable decay /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
First to begin at the spretualte /
Whose lyvynge should be example of grace.
Endued with parfett works of charity /
Seeking goddis honor in every case.
The world with his vanites they enbrace.
Renyinge god all though they say nay /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
Of this world they have the chief dominion
With stately preeminence temporal.
They preasume to be had in opinion /
Of the people / as lords imperial.
Worsshipfull seniours we must them call /
Requyrynge that we should to them obey /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
The riches and gooddes of the common we all /
Has set them in their honor full hye.
They are occasion that theves do steall /
And cause of all mischefe and misery.
The wordly treasure they consume ydely.
Nothing regarding but pasta^ce and play
But it cannot thus endure all way.
The labor of the poor people they devower
And of nobles they waste the patrimony.
They teach and exhort men god to honor
With their temporal substannce and money.
They claim tithes to supporte their folly.
Inventynge many a faulce offering day /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
They ought of duty to preach the gospel /
The words of life / so dulcet and sweet.
How be it there against chefly they rebel /
Christis doctrine troaden under their fete.
They bear us in hand that it is not mete.
The gospel to be known of people lay /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
They should be meke / and they are full of pride
Void of true patience replete with ire.
Envy they hold / charity set a side /
Retaynynge for chastity carnal desire.
Slouthe and glotteny in their hole empire.
Has made temperance and labor to straye
But it cannot thus endure all way.
Emprours and king they trappe in their lure /
Deceavynge them bey falce adulacion.
So that of promocious they be sure /
Full little they ponder their damnacion.
They geve them no true informacion /
And that evidently parceave they may /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
The works of mercy upon them are spent.
Pour people defraudynge with injury.
They drink the blood of souls innocent /
Simple folk begylynge outrageously.
Their foul fylthy carkes to magnyfy.
They wrappe in robes and costly array /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
Goddis co^maundme^t they tra^sgresse openly
To his godly love no respect havynge.
They take his name in vain with blasfemy /
Holy days after their own mind faynynge
To honor their pare^t they are disdaynynge
More covetous then kytes waiting apraye.
But it cannot thus endure all way.
Letcherous lust leawdly they enbrace /
Forbiddynge wedloke against goddis will.
Their subject they oppress in wretched case /
Prone unto morther christen men to spill.
Sacrilege and simony is their corn mill.
Using falce witness the truth to delay /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
The sacrement of christis ordinance.
Institute our feeble faith to sustain.
They have perverted unto our hyndraunce.
Enforcing us to trust in tryfles vain.
Wother new sacrement falcely they feign.
Obscuri^ge god word as much as they may
But it cannot thus endure all way.
Christis fredo^ they have brought in bondage
Of hevenly rightes making marchandyse.
In gostly works they covett avauntage /
To feed their insaciate covetyse.
Of the damnable mass they make a sacryfyse
Compellynge men dearly for it to pay /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
Of hell and heven they make chevesance /
Faynynge as they list a purgatory.
Hypocrisy is leader of their dance /
With wrong extorcion and vsery.
Of Christis word they make heresy /
Kedy and prompte christen men to betraye /
But it cannot thus endure all way.
Wherefore brefly to fynnysshe my balade /
O hevenly father / upon the I call.
Have pity on man / whom thou have made /
To serve the in fredom spretuall.
Rid us from antichristis bonds so thrall.
Wherewith we are fast bound night and day
That thy name be not blasphemed all way.
Lo now I have done my best /
To satisfy the request /
According as thou desyredst.

Wat. I will hold the then no longer /
But look that thou remember /
To fulfill that thou promysedst.

Here follows the Secunde part.
Ief. O Lord god what good days /
These monks have in abbeyes /
And do nether swett nor swyncke.
They live in welthynes and ease /
Havynge what soever they please /
With delicate meat and drink.
Where with they farce their bellies so full /
That to all goodness they are dull /
Making merry with gill and Joan.
They sit slepynge in a corner /
Or momblynge their pater noster /
Their mind nothing there upon.
Be they never so strong or starcke /
They will exercise no manner warcke /
Nor labor boddily.

Wat. Art thou here Ieffray mate?

Ief. Ye / why co^mest thou so late?
I am feign for the to tarry.

Wat. I was troubled with the estates /
I beshrowe all their folisshe pates /
For coming here this day.

Ief. So mot I the I thought the same /
How be it the stuarde was to blame /
That he did no better porvaye.

Wat. By thy faith / had thou better fare /
In the cloister where as thou ware /
Under the rule of the manastery?

Ief. Fare cotha? they eat their belies full /
Every man as much as he wull /
And none says black is his eye?

Wat. What do they for it / any thing?

Ief. Truly nothing but read and sing /
Passing the time with sport and play.

Wat. That is a life in deed for the nones /
Thou ware a fool by these ten bones /
When thou came fro them away?

Ief. O I thyncke my silfe much fortunate /
That fro their life I am separate /
Seeing it is so abominable.

Wat. What abhominacion is there in?

Ief. Alas mate all to geder is sin /
And wretchedness most miserable.

Wat. What a man of religion /
Is reputed a dedde person /
To worldly conversacion?

Ief. It is of a truth they are dedde /
For they are in no use nor stedde /
To christen men's consolacion.
And as a dedde stynkynge carkace /
Vnproffitably cloyeth a space /
If it be kept above grownde.
So in their life supersticious /
Of wicked crimes enormious /
No manner proffitablenes is fownde /

Wat. Yett their order is very strayte?

Ief. Ye but they use soche a consayte /
That they make it easy ynowe.
More easy by the twenty part /
Then to labor in some art /
Or to go with the carte or plowe.

Wat. They have man the world forsaken /
And a spretuall life taken /
Consistynge in gostly busynes.

Ief. What call ye the world I pray?

Wat. Welthy riches and pleasurs gaye /
And occasions of synfulnes.

Ief. Then are they in the world still /
For they have all that they will /
With riches and possessions.
And as touching the realm of vice /
Pride / wrath / envy / and avarice /
With wother sinful transgressions.
In this world that we do name /
There is none so far out of frame /
And lyve in soche outragiousnes.

Wat. Yett Ieffrye thou errest so god me save /
For the friars no possessions have /
But lyve only by pure alms.

Ief. Friars? now they are worst of all /
Ruffian wretches and rascal /
Lodesmen of all knavisshnes.
Though they be no possessioners /
Yett are they intollerabill beggars /
Lyvynge on rapyn and disceyte.
Worshipful matrons to begyle /
Honorable virgins to defyle /
Continually they do wait.
Of honesty they have no regard-
To displease god they are not afearde /
For the valor of a pynne /
Of whordom they are the very baudes /
Fraudulent inventers of frauds /
Provocacion unto sin.
They are slander of vertousnes /
Occasion unto viciousnes
Chickens of the devils brood.
To the truth they are adversaries /
Diligent imageners of lies /
Depravers of those that be good.
They are antichristis godsones /
Promowters of his pardones /
And proctours of simony.
They are brokers heven to sell /
Fre copy holders of hell /
And fe fermers of purgatory.
Of satan they are the soudiers /
And antichristis own mariners /
His ship forwards to convey.
And to conclude seriously /
They are the hell howndes verily /
Enmies against goddis word allwaye.

Wat. Now thou art greatly oversene /
For in places there as I have been /
They do good I the certify.
For if it were not for the friars /
There would not be in seven years /
A sermon in the poor contry.
And as for their lyvynge truly /
They beg peoples alms purly /
Taking soche things as they geve.
They have no wast superfluite /
But even their bare necessite /
Scant enough whereby to leve.

Ief. I mean not that they are all bad /
For I would the devil them had /
Then with a fair deliverance.
But of the gretter part I thought /
Which I say are worsse then naught /
Replete with mischevous vengeance.
Their preaching is not scripture /
But fables of their conjecture /
And men's ymaginacions.
They bring in old wyves tales /
Both of England / France / and Wales /
Which they call holy narracions.
And to them scripture they apply /
Pervertynge it most shamfully /
After their own opinions.
Wherewith the people being fed /
In to manyfolde errors are led /
And wretched supersticions.
Of Christ our merciful saveoure /
They make a judge full of terroure /
Only threatninge onre dmnacion.
Whose faveoure as they falsely feign /
We cannot be able to obtain /
With out saints mediacion.
They say that holy men's suffrages /
Pardons masses / and pilgremages /
For sins make satisfaccion.
They bid us in our works to trust /
Whereby they say that we must /
Deserve our salvation.
Faith litell or nothing they repute /
Whereof we being destitute /
Are brought into desperacion.
And as for their life doutles /
It is the well of ongraciousnes /
Of iniquite the myroure.
The alms that poor folk should have /
Wretchedly a way they do crave /
Tolyve ydely without labor.
Dissaytes continually they do muse /
And crafty falshod daily they use /
With simple folk greatly dissembling.
They fear little whom they offend /
Acustumed to rappe and rende?
All that comes in their fingrynge.
Their miserable disposicion /
Causes strife and sedicion /
In all places where as they dwell.
There is none unhappiness done /
In any christen regione /
But a friar is of the counsel.
Though they say that their order /
Is to have no thing in proper /
But to use all things in co^mone.
Yett there is no co^menalte /
Which has so great parcialite /
As their miserable religione.
For where as the heddes principal /
Whom master docters they call /
Lyve in welthy abundance.
The wother are poor and nedy /
Leadynge their lyves in penury /
Scant havynge their sustenance.
Of their brothers vexacion /
They have no compassion /
Despysynge those that be in sickness.
Against all order of charity /
They desdayne forto have pete /
Upon them that are in destres.
To show all their unhappiness /
So abominable and shamles /
It were over tedious and long.

Wat. Thou have said enough all ready /
They cannot be much wors lightly /
If the devil be not them among.

Ief. As for that thou nedest not fear /
The devil with them is familiare /
All way both at bed and at board.

Wat. The observauntes are not so disposed?

Ief. Will thou have their life disclosed /
Brefly rehearsed at a word?

Wat. Now mate I pray the heartily.

Ief. So god help me of all hypocrysy /
They are the very foundation.

Wat. Peace man / what speak thou?
I perceave well thou errest now /
With words of diffamacion.

Ief. Why thynkest thou that I do err?

Wat. Because the world does them prefer /
For their wholly conversacion.

Ief. Ye so were the scrybes and pharisays /
Through their falce hypocrisy ways /
Among the Iues in reputacion.
Nevertheless in inward manners /
They were worse then open sinners /
Whom our lord also did coursse.

Wat. Make of them soche compareson?

Ief. Ye savynge after my opinion /
The observant are far worse.

Wat. It is not possible to be so /
For they show there as they go /
Of simplenes great aperaunce.

Ief. Ye so does the fox wother while /
All though he can many a wyle /
Pretend a simple countenance.

Wat. Thou do wrongfully surmyse.

Ief. Nay I tell the it is their gyse /
To have two faces in a hoode.

Wat. What do thou mean thereby?

Ief. That they are dissemblers universally /
And feawe or none of them be good.

Wat. They use no whordom / nor robbery /
Nor take men's goods wrongfully /
As far as I can hear or se?

Ief. Open advoutrers they are none /
Yet are they not virgens every chone /
All though they pro fesse chastity.
They have pollucions detestable /
And in ward brennyng intolerable /
Of the flesshly concupiscence.
Ye and wother whiles advoutry /
With wother means of letchery /
Cloaked under a feigned pretense.
Which to overcome certainly /
They use not the right remedy /
Of our lord is institucion.
Gevynge head to spretes of errors /
And doctrine of divlysshe doctors /
Which do make prohibicion.
And as touching theft to be plain /
They are the gretest theves that raygne /
In all the world now a days
For all wother theves commonly /
Of them which have abundantly /
And of rich folk take their prays.
But the observaunt no people do spare
Making their quest every wheare /
With most importunate cravynge.
To beg of the pover and nedy /
They are as dogs most gredy /
And wolves incessantly ragynge.

Wat. Yet they never handell money?

Ief. No for that is a subtle policy /
To uphold their mad disgysynge.
For when antichrist satan's soune /
To stablysshe his realm had begoune /
Temporal honor despysynge.
To have all in his donimion /
He made made many a religion /
With outward holiness aperynge.
Which into sects innumerable /
Were divided with out fable /
The world in care forto bring.
By their colored devocion /
To the people they gave a mocion /
Their favor craftly purchasing.
And so by their contrivynge cast /
The got clean a way at the last /
Their chief possessions temporally.
Whereby lay people opressed sore /
Scant could they geve any more /
Concerning lands and patrimony.
Then came the four orders of friars /
Which are the substanciall pillars /
Of antichristis mayntenaunce.
So holy them selves they did make /
That all possessions they did forsake /
Wilful poverty to inhaunce.
To live by alms they did pretend /
And received all that god did send /
Sheawynge tokens of perfection.
Wherefore the people did them honor /
With gretter love and faveoure /
Then those that had possession.
Except livelod and lands only /
They received all that came freely /
Whether it were money or ware.
How be it they did multiply /
In all provinces so innumerably /
Through the world in every quartear.
That the people wexed weary /
Seeing they could not keep a penny /
But the friars would beg it away.
At the last came the observaunt /
Of antichrist the trusty servaunt
To bring the world in more dekaye.
And least they should seem chargeable /
They fownde a new way deceavable /
To begylde both young and old.
They were of soche supersticione /
That in proper or in co^mone /
They would nothing keep nor hold.
Of their needs havynge the use /
To handle money they did refuse /
Faynynge austerite of pennaunce.
Whereby with desirous affecte /
The people had a grett respect /
Unto their painted observaunce.
In somoche that though their lands /
Was geven clean out of their hondes /
By means of the possessioners.
And also most greveously oppressed /
With the daily cravynge and quest /
Of the vnsaciate friar beggars.
Yett the observaunt seemed so parfyt /
That to healpe them they judged yt /
With out charge a thing charitable.
Wherefore all the wother sects /
In manner reputed abiectes /
The observaunt were honorable.
Upon whom the works of mercy /
Were bestowed continually /
With superfluous abundaunce.
And so under a lewd color /
In ydelnes they did devour /
The poor peoplis sustenaunce.
They have increased so their number /
That all the world they do encomber /
With intolerable oppression.
They are more noyous agret deal /
In hyndraunce of the common wealle /
Above any wother faccion.
For where as the people before /
Were half beggered and more /
By the wother orders before said.
They robbed the world vterl y /
Causynge it with extreme beggary /
In grett ruin to be dekayde.

Wat. Thou speak against conscience /
For we perceave by experience /
What a godly life they lead.
They fly diligently all excess /
Livynge in poverte and scasnes /
With small drink and brown bread.

Ief. Thynkest thou they live in penury?

Wat. Or else they are hipocrites verily /
Of shamfull dissimulacion.

Ief. Say that hardly once again /
For they lead a life to be plain /
Full of worldly delectacion /
First they have befe and mutten /
Of the chief that may be gotten /
With bred and drink of the best.
And that morover so largely /
That to farce and stuff their belly /
They take more then they can deiest.
They have sauces with every disshe /
Whither that it be flesh or fysshe /
Or else they wilnot be content.
To eat bred that is brown or stale /
Either to drink thynne byere or ale /
They count it not convenient.
And many times they have daynties /
Sent from dyvers lords and ladies /
Their wholly suffrages to procure.

Wat. Yet they nether bake nor brewe.

Ief. No for all labor they exchewe /
I the faithfully ensure.

Wat. How have they their meat roast or bake?

Ief. Wother men for them the pain take /
Whom spretuall fathers they call.

Wat. And have they no spretuall mothers?

Ief. Yes with many sisters and brothers /
And also daughters spretuall.

Wat. How come they to kynred so nigh /

Ief. Because they can flatter and lie /
Making beleve the cow is wode.

Wat. They cannot lie though they would /
For they will nether silver nor gold /
Nor covet any man's good.

Ief. Trowest thou they covyt nothing /
Where as they come a beggyng /
To the housse of a poor man?
Which has both wife and children /
And is not able to find them /
Soynge the best that ever he can.
Yet he must unto the friars geve /
All though he should his household greve /
Havynge naught them selves to eat.

Wat. O they have then the gretter mede.

Ief. Ye god geve them evil to speed /
That do pover creaturs so entreat.
For they should their livynge get /
With boddely labor and swett /
Whereby they might healpe wother.

Wat. So they do healpe them spretually.

Ief. Soche spretualnes I defye /
When pover people dye for honger.

Wat. Men say they are good to the pover /
And geve every day at their doer /
Grett alms and refresshynge.

Ief. They geve alms / but how?
When they have eaten ynowe /
Their gredy paunches replenisshynge.
Then gadder they up their levett /
Not the best morsels but gobbett /
Which unto pover people they deal.

Wat. Then are they like with out doubt /
Unto certain theves devoute /
Which though they use to steal.
Yet they are liberal and fre /
If any pover creature they se /
To geve him part of their stolen gear,

Ief. Now truly their disposicion /
Is not unlike of condition /
Savynge in this point they differ.
That where as theves liberally /
Geve their goods gotten wrongfully /
To the pover with true affection.
They geve no thing in very trothe /
But scrappes which they would be loathe /
To use again in their refeccion.

Wat. Pover folk yet commend them greatly.

Ief. But if they knew as much as I /
They would rather on them complain.

Wat. How do they pover people offend?

Ief. By cause in ydelnes they spend /
Which unto them should pertayne.

Wat. They are not ydell I dare say /
Whyl they read / sing / and pray
Continually every hour.

Ief. I call it ydelnes vnproffetable /
Which in no case is confortable /
To the necessite of our neighbor.

Wat. Well yett the apostle does write /
A just man's prayer does proffyte /
And is very efficacious.

Ief. Are they just in thy reputacion?

Wat. After their own affirmacion /
Truly they are just and rightous.

Ief. Then it is an evident token /
That they are of whom it is spoken /
Ve vobis qui iustificatis vos ipsos.

Wat. What do thou by these words note?

Ief. That under neath a friars cote /
Much hipocrisy they gloss.

Wat. Reputest thou it hipocrisy /
That they use to go so holyly /
In cut shues with out any hose?

Ief. Be it hipocrysy or no /
To mangill their good shues so /
Me thinks it but folisshnes.

Wat. They cut but the upper ledder /

Ief. No for it is much easier /
Then to cut the soles doutles.

Wat. They do it for pennaunce sake /

Ief. For all that great shifte they make /
To avoyde all corporal sofferaunce.

Wat. They show signs of penan^ce outwardly.

Ief. Ye but they find soche a remedy /
That they feel little grevaunce.
For in covent where as they are /
Thycke mantels of fryse they wear /
With sockes to keep their fete warm
Then have they fire at their pleasure /
And to sit thereby at their leaysure /
No man saying them any harm.
And when they walk their stacions /
They seek gentilmens habitacions /
Where as they fare deliciously.
For be there never so grett prease /
They are set up at the hy dease /
Taken like lords honorably.
They have also to wasshe their fete /
Water made hott with erbes sweet /
And a good fire in their chamber.
Then have they bred / ale / and wine /
With a rich bed of down fine /
Decked after the best manner.
And paraventure the good father /
Has in his sleve a bladder /
Full of gynger / nutmegges or graynes.
Which to make the drink mighty /
He puts therein a quantite /
To comfort and warm his veins.

Wat. They find not this whersoever they come?

Ief. Sir I wis it is their custom /
In gentilmens places commonly.

Wat. Yet when they go on far journeys /
They cannot espy out all ways /
Gentilmens houses so redely.

Ief. Mary before their departing /
They have by mouth or writing /
The names of places where they dwell.

Wat. Some time they fail yet I judge?

Ief. Then do they mormor and grudge /
Like youge devils of hell.

Wat. They want soche things in their cloister?

Ief. Concerning the fare of their froyter /
I did tell the a fore partly.
But then they have gest chambers /
Which are ordened for strangers /
And for fathers to make merry.
There have they ale / wine / and byre /
And in winter time a good fire /
With gaye conceytes many wother.

Wat. What is their co^municacion?

Ief. By my sothe murmuracion /
One backbytynge another.

Wat. They have nothing to murmur fore.

Ief. I tell the they murmur more /
Then any persons that I know.
Full of envious suspicion /
Overwhelmed with ambicion /
Though their vocacion be low.
With all diligence they labor /
To obtain noble men's favor /
And to be ladys confessors.
In soche matters daily they boste /
Who with grett estates may do most /
Reckenynge them selve wise seniours.

Wat. Do they desire to be conversant /
In courts of virtue so scant /
Entangled with all ungraciousness?

Ief. They are content to be partners /
With all ungracious lyvers /
If so be they geve them alms.

Wat. I put case they geve nothing?

Ief. Then whether he be lord or king /
They will his manners deprave.
How be it though they be advoutrers /
Extorsioners / or whormongers /
If to be their friends they witsave.
Then with grett co^mendacion /
In their flattering predicacion /
They will their acts magnify.
Wherefore whoares / theves / and bawdes /
And all soche as live by frawdes /
To their order have a fantesy.

Wat. How do they which are true preachers?

Ief. They are charged in their chapters /
Under their prelatis strayte precepte.
That against their good fownders /
Benefacters / and friendly doers /
No enormites they detecte.

Wat. If they set men thus to scole /
I trow they make many a fool /
Of ladys and gentill women.

Ief. Shall I show the how they do?

Wat. Now for our lordis sake go to /
To tell the cast of this wholly men.

Ief. First it is their custom ever /
To go / two and two to gether /
Except a grett impediment.
And so to my ladys chamber /
Foremost pricketh in the elder /
Which of them is most ancient.
As soon as my lady he does se /
With a countenance of gravite /
He saluteth her noblenes.
My lady then of his coming /
Affectously reioysynge /
Welcometh him with gladness.
The father then with his glosynge style /
After that he has preached a while /
With babblynge adulacion.
My lady with many a good morrow /
Begins her tale to follow /
Speaking after this fassion.
O father ye do grett penance /
To win eternal inheritance /
Throw prayer / fast / and watchynge.
Ye use forto swear no oaths /
Lyinge evermore in your clothes /
Nether shetes nor shurtes wearynge.
Ambicion ye set a side /
Flyinge worldly pomp and pride /
Which with us is daily in ure.
Happy are ye and fortunate /
To live inso parfet a state /
Where to be saved ye are sure.
If it were not for your wholines /
This world full of viciousnes /
Had been destroyed long or this.
How be it / ye do pacify /
The rigor of god almighty /
Toward us that live a mis.
The father then with words of comfort /
Begins my lady to exhort /
Saying thus / o good madame.
Your ladyshippe needs not to care /
For we pray daily for your welfare /
Or else we were greatly to blame.
Wholly. S. Fraunces do you mede /
Many a pover friar ye do feed /
Of your bounteous charity.
Wherefore ye were made sister /
In the last general chapter /
Of our whole confraternite.
By means whereof ye are partetaker /
Of our watchynge / fast / and prayer /
Remembrynge you in our memento.
There is no day that comes to pass /
But ye have part of many a mass /
Preservynge you from carfull woe.
Wholly. S. Fraunces also him selve /
Which is above the apostles twelve /
Next unto Christ in authorite.
Shall Be your perpetual defense /
Against sycknes and pestilence /
Souckerynge you in aduersite.
And for a sure aprobacion /
He brings forth a narracion /
De libro conformitatum.
How. S. Frances their advoury /
Once in the year enters purgatory /
When that his fest day does come.
And from thens he takes out /
Those which to him were devoute /
Or to his order charitable.
Thus my lady not very wise /
Is brought in to foles paradyse /
Through their words disceavable.

Wat. Has Christ among them no place?

Ief. Christ catha? in no manner case /
He is rather to their damage.
Be cause through his passion /
For us he made satisfaccion /
Without any man's suffrage.
Whose doctrine if they did observe /
Plainly for honger they should sterve /
Except they would to labor fall.

Wat. How conclude they then at the end?

Ief. My lady must to their covent send /
Her blyssynge with a trentall.

Wat. What is the trentall / in paper?

Ief. Or else in good gold or silver /
To make them a recreacion.

Wat. They will not for all England /
Handill money with their bare hand /
As I have had informacion.

Ief. Yett in golden cups to drink /
And to touch women I thyncke /
No grett parell they do adverte.
And though some of them never dare /
Touch any coin with hondes bare /
Yett they touch it with their hertt.
They have also withouten lesynge /
Money in wother men's keeping /
Ready at their co^maundment.
Which by the wryttynge of a bill /
In whatt soever uses they will /
Daily is bestowed and spent.
In any covent where they be /
Very feawe of them thou shall se /
But have a friend temporally.
To whom for every tryfill vain /
That comes once into their brain /
If by writing they signify.
Though it cost a noble or twain /
By and by they shall it attain /
Not foarsynge what is laid out.
Which truly if they should purchase /
With labor and swett of their face /
They would wotherwyse look about.

Wat. If it be as thou do express /
Plainly their rule they do transgress /
Retaynynge in common or in proper.

Ief. They have the popis declaracion /.
Making thereof a mitigacion /
In most favorable manner.
Under whose divlysshe proteccion /
They have put them in subieccion /
As children of iniquite.
Wherefore he takes to his person /
The name of their dominion /
To use it gevynge liberte.
They have scant as much as a lousse /
Nether clothes / church / nor housse /
But the pope there of is awner.

Wat. Why ascrybe they it to the pope?

Ief. By cause with soche craft they hope /
To begylde people seculer.
For where as they live welthyly /
And have all thing abundantly /
Acordynge to their apetyte.
Yet under soche falce pretense /
They feign to soffre indigence /
Contempnynge all worldly delight.
The pope also for this intent /
Because to his errors they consent /
Alowynge his abhominacions.
Grants to their avauntages /
Many bulls and previleges /
With wretched confirmacions.
Whose favor to recompense /
Against all good conscience /
They preach as much as they may.
That the people with reverence /
Continue still in obedience /
Of the popis rule night and day.
Though his works be contrary /
They say that he is goddis vicary /
And of Christ the leftenaunte / *
Making of a fend / and angel /
Christ / of antichrist rebel /
A saint / of the devils servaunte.

Wat. I supposed with out dissembling /
That they used in their preaching /
All ways to sheawe the verite.
Seeing among the states royal /
They were reputed substanciall /
With out any parcialite.
They used to go in pover wede /
Exhorting both in word and deed /
Unto the joy celestial.
As though they had no erthely love /
But only to the life above /
Despysynge the joys of this life mortal.

Ief. The wholynes that they did sheawe /
Principally did over throw /
The faith of all christendom.
For they were confederate /
With antichrist so inveterate /
Called the Pope of Rome.
Whose laws to set in renown /
Christis doctrine they plucked down /
Pervertynge all wholly scripture.
And yet so perfett they did apere /
That grett men's confessions to here /
In every place they had the cure.
They pretended soche parfetnes /
That simple people more and les /
Unto their words gave credence.
Whatsoever fables they did tell /
They were taken as the gospel /
Approved with common sentence.
Wherefore by their seduccion /
They have been the destruction /
Of all true christen liberte.
They make cruelnes of mercy /
Perfeccion of hipocrisy /
And of fredome captivite.
Of counterfeyted simlacion /
They ymagen mortificacion /
Turnynge faith to infidelite.
Ydelnes they name contemplacion /
Faynynge zele of murmuracion /
Enmies to charitable amite.

Wat. I marvayle much and wonder /
That they should have any anger /
Or any envious debate.
Seeing from worldly royalte /
And promocions of dignite /
They are willingly private.

Ief. Though they have no worldly honors /
Yet nether kings ne emperors /
Nor wother states of the temperalte.
Have soche strife in their provision /
As observauntes in their religion /
With dedly hatred and enmyte.
To be made confessors / and preachers /
Wardens / discretes / and ministers /
And wother offices of prelacy.
With grevous malice and rancour /
One against a another does murmour /
Full of craft and inconstancy.
They have nether dread nor shame /
Their faultles brethren to defame /
Havynge none occasion why.
Young men against their superiors /
And prelates against their inferiors /
One at another has envy.
In chapters and visitacions /
They use wrong accusations /
With many slanderous iniuryes
They execute sharp correccions /
To ponysshe the transgressions /
Of their fantastycke ceremonies.
God and his laws they omit /
Aplyinge their malicious wit /
To keep man's invencions.
They are patrons of ydolatry /
Promouters unto herisy /
And bryngers up of dissencions.

Wat. Now by the faith of my body /
The obsevaunt are not so holy /
As they do outwardly seem.

Ief. If thou knew manyfestly /
What a life they occupy /
Thou would marvayle I deem.

Wat. I have heard enough and to much /
If their conversacion be soche /
It is pite that they are souffered.
But now touching the manners /
Of these religious possessioners /
I would hear somewhat more uttered.

Ief. I told the in the beginning /
How their wicked lyvynge /
Is greatly abominable.
Marcke their life intentifely /
And thou shale not therein espy /
Any thing that is commendable.

Wat. What say thou then of their vows?
Whereby them selves they spowse /
To god / by a certain promise.

Ief. Surly in it Christ they forsake /
And them selves wholly they betake /
To live in the devils serves.

Wat. Why / they profess chastity /
Obedience / and wilful poverte /
Which allmygthy god does approbate.

Ief. Ye for all that I promise the /
They keep none of all the three /
With mundane affections intricate.

Wat. All worldlynes they do renownce.

Ief. Though with words they so pronownce /
Their hertes do not consent.

Wat. They observe tuly obedience.

Ief. Ye but savynge reverence /
Nothing after Christis intent.
For after goddis commandment /
They should obey their parent.
Honorynge them as is their duty.
Nor with standing they are so mad /
Their fathers and mothers are glad /
To honor them reverently.
And where as holy scripture would /
That unto all powers we should /
Obey as to goddis ordenaunce.
They are under no power at all /
Nether spretuall nor temporal /
To the common weallis fortheraunce.

Wat. They obey unto their prelate /
At all seasons yerly and late /
His precept accomplisshynge.

Ief. I will not deny they do obey /
Unto the ruler of their abbey /
A carle of their own choosing.
Yet is it in supersticiousnes /
With outen any profitablenes /
Of their neghbours comfort.
They serve them selves and no mo /
Carynge litell how the world go /
So that they have pleasure and sport.
And contrary the seculers /
Are under temporal rulers /
With their children and wyves.
At all seasons pressed and ready /
Tu put them selves in ieopardy /
Aventurynge both goods and lyves.
To serve the king in war and peace /
They putt them selves always in preace /
The defense of the realm assistynge.
Where as the religious sects /
Unto no laws are subjects /
Obeyinge nether god nor king.
If the king will their service use /
Forth with they lay for an excuse /
That they must do goddis business.
And if in it they be fownde negligent /
They say the king is impediment /
Because they must do him serves.
And if the king shall them compel /
Then obstymatly they do rebel /
Fleinge to the popis mayntenaunce.
Of whom they obtain exempcions /
From all the iurisdiccions /
Of temporal governannce.

Wat. Of the pope with out grett expens /
They can obtain no soche defens /
As men say which do it know.

Ief. Yet are they so far out of tune /
That they do their goods so consume /
Rather then in good uses to bestow.

Wat. I perceave by this with out fail /
Their obedience does not provayle /
But what say thou to their poverte?

Ief. What need I thereof to speak /
Consideringe they do it break /
Endued with rich felicite.

Wat. Do they soche lyvelod possess?

Ief. They have in manner the riches /
Of every land and nation.
Namly in England region /
They excede in possession /
And lordly dominacion.
The black order has more alone /
Then all the nobles every chone /
As touching their patrimony.
Thou would surly marvel /
To se their fare and aparell /
In all points superfluusly.
There be monks of soche statlynes /
That scant will soffer at their mess /
A lord of bludde with them to sit.
Whose proud service to behold /
In plate of silver and gold /
It passes a man's wit.
Knights and squyers honorable /
Are feign to serve at their table /
As unto Suits excellent.
Sivers of them have the degree /
Of worthy Earls in dignite /
And are lords of the parliament.

Wat. They descend of famous progeny?

Ief. Ye beggars sons most commonly /
Their fathers scant worth a groate.
Coming first to the abbey gate /
A beggynge with a scalled pate /
Havynge nether good shurt nor coat.
Which as soon as he is ones clad /
For a gentilman he is had /
Though he be but a starcke knawe.

Wat. Soche poverte is plente /
For by it avoydynge scacite /
All welthynes they have.

Ief. It is truly their fisshynge nett /
Pover men's goods away to get /
To satify their gluttenny.
It is the goulfe of devoracion /
And fountain of desolacion /
To all people generally.
Whereof in wholly scripture /
Is written a notable figure /
Showed in the book of Daniell /
How the prestes of Babilone /
With falshod acordynge in one /
Had an ydole called Bell.
Outwardly made all of bras /
And inwardly of earth it was /
Havynge a resceyte so devised.
That the ydole seemed to devowere
An. C. sheep with wine and flower /
Daily unto it sacryfised.
Which the prestes with their whores /
Through crafty contrived doors /
Entreinge in the night secretly.
And there making recreacion /
They consumed the oblacion /
Oppressynge the people grevously.
Which seemed so strange a thing /
That both the people and the king /
Reputed it a grett miracle.
Until Daniel at the last /
Perceavynge their disceavable cast /
Against it made an obstacle.
He uttered to their confusion /
The execrable illusion /
Wherewith the folk they sore noyed.
Causynge by his policy /
That this ydole utterly /
Was broken and destroyed.

Wat. Whereto do thou this compare?

Ief. Of religious persons to declare /
The intolerable enormite.
For as the prestes with their ydoll /
The pover people did pill and poll /
By their dissaytfull sutrelte.
So the children of perdicion /
Named men of religion /
With their wilful poverte.
The wide world forto beggar /
Day and night they indever /
Blyndynge the peoples simplicite.

Wat. I marvayle men make no restraynt /
Their dissaytfulnes to attaynt /
Whyls it is open and aperte.

Ief. Daniel is not yett come /
Which shall obtain the room /
Their fraudfull ways to subuerte*

Wat. When shall be then his coming?

Ief. I ensure the or long runnynge /
For he begins to draw nere.

Wat. Well then / this matter to remitt /
I would very feign a little fit /
Of their chastity to hear.

Ief. To tell the of their chastity /
It lies not in my capacite /
The shamfullnes thereof to compryse.

Wat. Men say they live blissedly /
With out act of matrimony /
Ensuynge verteous exercise.

Ief. Their cloisters are the devils mwes
Far worse then any stwes /
Or common places of whordom.
They are the dens of baudines /
And fornaces of all letcherousnes /
Like unto Gomer and Sodom.
Young laddes and babes innocent /
They bring in by their intysment /
To their lewd congregation.
Whom they reccave to profession /
Before that they have discrecion /
To their eternal damnacion.
For when they feel by experience /
The brynnynge of the concupiscence /
Pryckynge their hertes with love.
Considering also their bondage /
How they can use no marriage /
As a christen man does behove.
Then to quench their apetytes /
They are feign to be sodomytes /
Abusing them selves unnaturally.
And so from hope of salvacion /
They fall into desperacion /
Ordrynge their lyves most shamfully.

Wat. I will not say the contrary /
But among a grett company /
One or two soche thou may find.

Ief Make the company grett or small /
Among a thousand find thou shall /
Scant one chaste of boddy and mind

Wat. They say yett with bold audacite /
That it rests in man's faculte /
If he will / to live chastely.

Ief. Then make they Christ a liar /
Calling it a gift singular /
Not geven to every boddy.
Paul also in his epistle /
Unto Timothe his disciple /
Writynge by sprete of prophecy.
Names it a dyvlisshe doctrine.
Which against scripture divine /
Forbids folk to mary.
Morover the storys not faynynge /
The lives of old fathers containing /
Geve reccorde to the same.
Which endued with godly science /
Exercysynge continual abstinence.
The lusts of the flesh to tame.
Yet feawe or none had the grace /
With all their labor to purchase /
The singular gift of chastity.
How should they then live chaste /
That of gostlynes have no taste /
Geven holy to carnalite.
Which as wolves and belly beasts.
Eating and drinking in their feasts /
The bloudde of the pover co^menalte /
They hate soche as are studious /
Abhorrynge those that are verteous /
As a toade / or poysonde serpente.
With out knowledge as asses brute /
Of all good manners destitute /
Braynles and insipient.

Wat. I se then he werre a very child /
Which would any mo abbeys bylde /
If the goods should be so ill spent.

Ief It werre fare better I suppose /
To pluck down a grett sort of those /
Which are all ready of costly bildynge /

Wat. Our lord forbid / that werre pete /
For they keep hospitalite /
Way farynge people harborynge.
Husband men and laborers /
With all common artificers /
They cause to have grett ernynge.
Their towns and villages /
With out exaccions or pillages /
Under them have much winning.
They keep also many servauntes /
Retaynynge fermers and tennauntes /
Which by them have their lyvynge.

Ief. Hospital abbeyes thou fyndest but feawe /
All though some of them for asheawe /
To blyndfelde the peoples sight.
Paraventure will not denaye /
If a gentle man come that way /
To geve him lodging for a night.
But if pover men thither resort /
They shall have full little comfort /
Nether meat / drink / ne lodging.
Savynge wother whiles perhap /
They get a feawe broken scrap
Of these cormorant levynge.

Wat. Well yett their fare considering /
It is I wis no small thing /
That they leave daily at their board.

Ief. Ye but through falce lorchers /
And unthrifty abbey lobbers /
To poor folcke little they a forde.
For the best meat away they carve /
Which for their harlott must serve /
With wother friends of their kynne.
Then proll the servynge officers /
With the yemen that be wayters /
So that their levett are but thynne.
And where as thou make relacion /
That men of sundry occupacion /
By them are set unto labor.
It is about soche folysshnes /
Concerning no proffytablenes /
Unto their neghbours soccoure.
In byldynge of chambers curious /
Churches / and houses / superfluous /
To no purpose expedient.
So that they may satisfy /
Their inordinate fantasy /
They care for no detryment.
Set dyce and card players a side /
And through out the world so wide /
They waste their good most in vain.
Their pride makes many a beggar /
Feawe or none farynge the better /
Except an ydell Iavel or twain.
Their towns sometime of renown /
Leawdly they cause to faule down /
The honor of the land to mar.
They sue their subiett at the law /
Whom they make not worth a straw /
Raynynge them giltles at the bar.
And that I me now report /
To their lordships a grett sort /
With whom they had controversys.
Namly / Saint Edmondis bery /
With dyvers wother a grett many /
Under the hold of monasterys.
Furthermore theare as I did wone /
All husband men they have undone /
Destroyinge the land miserably.

Wat. To prove that it were very hard.

Ief. Take heed how farmers go backwarde /
And thou shall se it with thine ey.
For the lands wealth pryncipally /
Stondeth in exercise of husbandry /
By encreace of catell and tillynge.
Which as long as it does prosper /
The realm goes backwarde never /
In stabill felicite perseverynge.
The abbeys then full of covetyse /
Whom possessions could not suffyse /
Ever more and more encroachynge.
After they had spoiled gentill men /
They undermined husband men /
In this man^er them robbynge.
Wheare a farm for xx.lj. was set /
Under.xxx. they would not it let /
Raysynge it up on so hye a some.
That many a good husholder /
Constrained to geve his farm over /
To extreme beggary did come.

Wat. I have heard say of mine elders /
That in England many fermers /
Rept gaye housholdes in times passed.

Ief. Ye that they did with liberalite /
Sheawynge to poor people charity /
But now all together is dasshed.
Of rich farm places and halles /
Thou seist nothing but bare walls /
The roses fallen to the grownde /
To turn fair houses into pasture /
They do their diligent cure /
The common well to confownde.

Wat. How have the abbeys their payment?

Ief. A new way they do invent /
Lettynge a dosen farms under one.
Which one or two rich francklyng /
Occupyinge a dosen men's lyvyng /
Take all in their own hondes a lone.

Wat. The wother in paiynge their rent /
Be lycklyhod were negligent /
And would not do their duty.

Ief. They paid their duty and more /
But their farms are heythed so sore /
That they are brought unto beggary.

Wat. Have the francklyng thereby no gain?

Ief. Yes / but first they have much pain /
Yer they can get it substancially.
Payinge more for the entering in /
Then they shall be able to wyn^e /
A good while after certainly.
For to get the abbott consent /
Under the seal of the covent /
It is a thing very costly.
Where of the charges to recover /
Lest they should them selves enpover /
And be brought into decay.
Pover cilly shepperd they get /
Whom into their farms they set /
Lyvynge on milk / whyg / and whey.

Wat. Merciful lord / who heard ever tell /
Religious folk to be so cruel /
Supplantynge the temporalte.

Ief. Thou know not watkyn fellow /
How they have brought to sorrow /
In lykwyse the spretualte.

Wat. By what man^er cavillacion?

Ief. Surly through improperacion /
Of inumerable benefices.

Wat. Do they benefices improperate?

Ief. Ye and that many a curate.
Daily coursse their cruel bellies.

Wat. They eat nether church ne steple.

Ief. No but they rob the pover people /
Devowrynge their substance.

Wat. If they do spretually sow /
They may well temporally mow /
After the apostles ordenaunce.

Ief. Toshe they have it better cheap /
For they temporal goods reap /
And sow nothing spretually.
Their parisshons they sheare and clippe /
But they never open their lip /
To geve them any fode gostly.

Wat. Happily they do it in prevete.

Ief. So god healpe me it may well be /
Under some secret clausure.
For it is surly so invisible /
That I trow it is not possible /
To be seen of any creature.

Wat. What require they of benefices?

Ief. No thing but to have the sleces /
And avauntages carnally.

Wat. I perceave not well thy meaning.

Ief. They are redyer to take up tythynge /
Then to preach to them frutfully.

Wat. Is there any grett differynge /
Bitwene theft and tithe gaderynge /
After the practyse that we se?

Ief. Very litell / all things reckened /
Savynge that theves are corrected /
And rythe gaderers go scott fre.

Wat. Have they no circumspeccion /
With diligent affeccion /
For their paresshes to provyde?

Ief. They set in folysshe dotardes /
More mete forto be bearwardes /
Then christen men's souls to gyde.
And even as they do by farmage /
Bring the land into a rearage /
Contempnynge the state temporal.
In like manner by their rapyne /
They have brought into ruin /
The order ecclesiastical.

Wat. It apereth they are past grace.

Ief. They are the devils furnace /
Oven infernal insatiable.

Wat. If these monks are so noyous /
Both fraudulent and covetous /
To what uses are they proffitable?

Ief. Now by the death that I shall deye /
Of all people under neth the sky /
The world may them best spare.
Nether to the godly deite /
Nor yett to man's vtilite /
In any case proffitable they are.
And not only unnecessary /
But moroever clean contrary /
Defraudynge that to them is due.
For though their life so vicious /
To goddis laws is injurious /
Confowndynge the way of virtue.
Yet are they more presompteous /
Saying their works meritorious /
Healpe sinners to be goddis heirs.
Whereby Christis blood they despise /
As though it could not suffyse /
With out their damnable prayres.
And wheare as they should be pressed /
At all seasons doing their best /
The common well to maintain.
Their bellies are so full of grease /
That nether in war nor peace /
They cane do any healpe certain.
Yet their fyndyng they expende /
Which should the land defend /
Devowrynge many a knights fe.
They are nether gostly / ner worldly /
Rather divlysshe then godly /
With out any good properte.

Wat. If they be soche ydell raveners /
They are like to the grett coursers /
Which noble men in stables keep.
For they are cheresed all way /
With fresshe litter and good hay.
Doing right noght but eat and sleep.

Ief. There is in them grett diversite /
For if it come to extremite /
They save their masters from yvill.
Where as these miserable brybers /
Bring their fownders and healpers /
The straight way to the devil.

Wat. Are they like to wolves ravenous?

Ief. A grett deal more outrageous /
Far exceeding their rapacite.
For though they be cruel of kind /
Yett they leave their skynnes be hynde /
As a mendes for their cruelte
But this mischevous mou^ckry /
Though they rob every country /
Whyls they be here a lyve.
Yet can they not be so pleased /
But after that they be deceaced /
Least any by them should thryve.
They carry into their sepulture /
Their daily clothing and vesture /
Buried in their churlysshe habyte.

Wat. Have they on their botes also?

Ief. Ye by my trothe even ready to go /
To the devil withouten respyte.

Wat. There is some mystery pondered /
That they use so to be buried /
In their habyte and clothing.

Ief. No dout it is a mystery /
By coniectours manifestly /
Their wretched life betokenynge.
For as in this life they denayde /
Their christen neghbours to aid /
Lyvynge here vncheritably.
So by their death and latter end /
In their burial they pretend /
Not to be of Christis company.

Wat. To whom then do they pertayne?

Ief. To the devil their soverayne /
Which has them all in his bond.

Wat. Beware thou be not to bold /
For thy life were bought and sold /
If thou spoke this in England.

Ief. They may well both ban and course /
But they cannot do much wors /
Then they did to Hun the merchant.

Wat. Did they any grevaunce to him?

Ief. Out of this life they did him trym^e /
Because he was goddis servaunte.

Wat. He did some fault greatly notory?

Ief. No thing but for a mortuary /
The prestes against him did arise.
No manner fault in him was fownde /
Yet was he hanged / brent / and drownde.
His goods takyn up for a pryse.
As an herityke they him took /
Because he had many a book /
In english / of holy scripture.
Also he worshipped no images /
And would not go on pilgremages /
Using none oaths to periure.

Wat. Are the prelar so mad frantycke /
To judge soche a man an heritycke /
Showing tokens of fydelite?

Ief. They regard their worldly proffett /
Winning thereby many a forfett /
Which moreth them to crudelite.
Men's goods wrongfully to cease /
They make herityk whom they please /
By faulce relacion af Someners.

Wat. Have they none wother intelleccion?

Ief. Yes also by their confession /
Which they tell in prestes ears.

Wat. Dare they confessions to bewraye?

Ief. Confessions catha? ye by my faye /
They keep no secretnes at all.
Though noble men have doctors /
To be their private confessors /
Yet they have one that is general*

Wat. Beside those which are particular?

Ief. Ye / and that has brought some to care /
Of whom I could make rehearceall.

Wat. His name would I very feign here.

Ief. It is the englisshe Lucifer /
Wotherwyse called the Cardinal.
In all the land there is no wight /
Nether lord baron / nor knight /
To whom he has any hatred.
But either by sower speech or sweet /
Of their confessors he will wete /
How they have them selves behaved.
What they say / it is accepted /
In no point to be objected /
Though they be as falce as Judas.

Wat. What authorite do they allege?

Ief. It is their churches previlege /
Falcely to feign that never was.

Wat. Soche confessors are unjust.

Ief. Yett needs do it they must /
If they will to honor ascend.

Wat. Promocions are of the Kyngis gift?

Ief. For all that he makes soche shyft /
That in his pleasure they depend.
Though they have the kyngis patent /
Except they have also his assent /
It tourneth to none avauntage.
His power he does so extend /
That the kyngis letters to rende /
He will not forbear in his rage.

Wat. This is a grett presumpcion /
For a villayne bochers son /
His authorite so to avaunce.
But it is more to be marveyled /
That noble men will be confessed /
To these kaytives of miscreaunce.

Ief. O / the grett whore of Babylon /
With her deadly cup of poison /
Has brought them to dronkenship.
That painted bordes and ded stock /
Carved ydoles in stones and block /
Above allmyghty god they worship.

Wat. Has England soche stacions /
Of devoute peregrinacions /
As are in France and Italy?

Ief. Seek out lands every chone /
And thou shall find none so prone /
As England / to this ydolatry.
Of wholly Roodes / there is soche a sight /
That bitwene this and mydnyght /
I could not make explicacion.
Then have they ladies as many /
Some of grace and some of mercy /
With diverse of lamentacion.
Morover painted stock and stones /
With shrynes / full of rotten bones /
To the which they make oblacion.

Wat. What are they after thy supposing?

Ief. Strong theves with outen glosynge /
And authors of prevaricacion.

Wat. Take heed thou do not blaspheme.

Ief. After their works I them esteem /
Both to man and god our creatoure.
Where as is no god but one.
We ought to worship him alone /
And no falce gods to adoure.
Which of his honor is defrauded /
By these ydoles faulcely lauded /
With sacrifice and adoracion.
Man in like manner they rob /
Causynge poor folk to sygh and sobbe /
Taking away their sustentacion.

Wat. The goods that to them are offered /
Are they not to pover people proffered /
Their necessites to relefe?

Ief. It is wasted in ryetous revell /
Among many an ydell Iavell /
To norysshe morther and mischefe.

Wat. I hear say that besides London /
There is our lady of Wilsdon /
Which does grett miracles daily.

Ief. As for whordom / and letcherousnes /
She is the chief lady mastres /
Common paramoure of baudry.
Many men as it is known /
Keep mo children then their own /
By her miracles promocion.
Wyves to deceave their husbands /
Make to her many errandes /
Under color of devocion.

Wat. Do thou our lady so backbyte?

Ief. No but I have the stocks in despyte /
Whereby they dishonor her.
In scripture it is written /
And of our lord forbidden /
To be a falce ydolatrer.

Wat. Whyls thou do so far proceed /
How is it then in thy creed /
Of Saint Thomas of Cantourbury?

Ief. I beleve / and also I trust /
If that he were in this life just /
And of our lords vocacion.
That his soul has fruicion /
Perpetually with our intermission /
Of eternal consolacion.

Wat. Ye but I mean of his body /
Shryned in the monastery /
With gold and stones precious.
Also the grett miracles wrought /
And how of people he is sought /
With offerynges and gifts somptious.

Ief. As for that if we geve credence /
To our saveoure Christis sentence /
The Evangelists bearing record.
Many shall do things strange /
Whereby they will boldly chalange
To work in the name of our lord.
And yet Christ in them has no part /
But work them by the devils art /
Usurping an angels lykenes.
Which does him silfe so transpose /
Fraudulently to begyle those /
That contempne goddis rightousnes.

Wat. Nevertheless as clarckes defyne /
Workynge of miracles is a sign /
That unto god they are acceptable.

Ief. Shall we to men credence geve /
Or ought we the gospel to beleve /
Whose verite is impermutable?
I dare say / and abide thereby /
That Saynct Thomas of Caunterbury /
With mother Saynct canonysed.
If their painted efficacite /
Is but as it seems to be.
Of god they are despised.
For though they heal lame and blind /
With men (as they say) out of mind /
Healpynge diseases corporal*
Yet destroy they out of hand /
For every one of them a thowsande /
Concerning their souls spretuall.
And where as Christ does require /
That of of god we should desire /
All our necessite and need.
To them we make peticion /
Against goddis prohibicion /
To wicked doctors gevynge head.

Wat. Well yet I ensure the Ieffraye /
The gospel for them they lay /
Growndynge on it their argument.

Ief. Nay watkyn that is a starcke lie.

Wat. How shall we then the troth try /
By some probacion evident?

Ief. Mary take goddis wholly writing /
Nether adding nor diminysshynge /
But even plainly after the letter.

Wat. They say scripture is so diffuse /
That lay people on it to muse /
Should be never the better.
It is no medlyuge for foles /
But for soche as have been at scoles /
As doctors that be graduate.

Ief. Wenest thou that Peter the fissher /
Understood not scripture clearlyer /
Then the pharisaies obstinate?
Who did so wilfully resist /
Against the receavynge of Christ /
As they which were learned?

Wat. No wonder / for they knew him not.

Ief. No more do our doctors god wot /
In any point to be discerned.

Wat. Of Christ yett they make mention.

Ief. Ye for be cause their pension /
With benefices may be endued.
But in their life and behaveoure /
They despise Christ our saveoure /
Labourynge his word to exclude.

Wat. Can thou prove this in deed?

Ief. Whosoever will the gospel read /
To prove it shall need no testes.

Wat. Peraventure they would have it hid /
Wherefore to read it they forbid /
Lest men should know their wickedness.

Ief. Had thou studied an whoale year /
Thou could not have gone no nere /
To hit their crafty suttelnes.
For if the gospel were soffered /
Of lay people freely to be red /
In their own moders langage.
They should se at their fyngers ends /
The abhominacions of these fendes /
With the abusion of pilgremage.
Also to perceave every whitt /
What it is Saint for to visitt /
With nobles / brouches / and rings.

Wat. Soft thou this custume reprehende?

Ief. I thyncke no good man will commend /
Soche supersticious offerynges.
Whereof three point I will move /
By the which I shall plainly prove /
That it is a thing ungodly.
First a poor man of far dwelling /
For his wife and children labourynge /
To keep and find them honestly.
Paraventure for some sickness /
Or for a vow of folisshnes /
To accomplysshe Satan's institute.
Takes on him a far viage /
To some Saynctes shryne or image /
Leavynge his household destitute.
Which often times do mis carry.
The mean while that he does tarry /
Bestowynge his labor in vain.
And so goddis co^maundment neglecte /
For small tryfles of none effect /
They put them selves unto pain.
Secondaryly / what pevisshnes /
Is it to honor with riches /
Of dead saynct the bodies?
Seeing that whyls they here lyved /
From riches they were deprived /
As we read in their stories /
Thirdly / it is no Christen touch /
To se many a golden ouche /
With rings and stones preciously.
To make dead saynctes forto shine /
Where pover folk for honger pyne /
Dyinge with out healpe petiously.
And if with all possibilite /
Our christen neghbours poverte /
Duly to aid we are bownde.
Why do Saynctes it then transgress /
In whom charitable perfetnes /
In especial should redownde?
Saynct Ihon to Christ so amiable /
Says / except we be charitable /
Lovynge each wother fraternally.
It boreth not Christ to profess /
For why / we wander in darcknes /
With our light erroniously.
For how can be have charity /
That seith his neghbours necessite /
And refuses him to socoure?

Wat. I marvayle not by him that me made /
If they be with gold and stones so lade /
Though they cannot their neghbours se.
But now to speak ernestly /
Have their souls celestially /
In soche offerynges any delight?

Ief. It is to them grett despleasure /
Abhorrynge it out of measure /
As a thing done in their despyte.

Wat. What were best then to be done?

Ief. To break them in pieces a none /
Among poor folk to be distributed.

Wat. Haw / to do that deed who durst /
Seeing that he should be a courst /
And as an herityke reputed.

Ief. Let them with furiousnes swell /
Coursynge with book / bell / and candell /
Whyls they have breath for to speak.
Yet had we the Kings license /
We would with outen diffydence /
Their golden shrynes in pieces break.

Wat. What should we do with their riches?

Ief. Geve it to pover men in alms /
To whom of dute it does fonge.

Wat. The Saynctes then would be angry /
If that we should be so hardy /
Unlawfully to do them wrong.
For some men have it assayde /
Whom saynctes have shreawedly arayde /
In revengynge their injury.
So that by an whole nyghtes space /
They were feign to keep one place /
The doors stondynge open apertly.

Ief. And what was their fynall chance /

Wat. By my sothe / in an hanging dance /
Their neck in a cord to preve.

Ief. Use the Saynctes any men to kill?

Wat. No but they make them stand still /
Until they be taken of the Schereve.
Then are thy like and semblable /
Unto our bisshops venerable /
Which say / we will not morther.
But they put men in soche savegarde /
That with in a while afterward /
They be sure to go no forther.

Ief. Are not soche saynct reprehensible?

Wat. Ye for they should be invincible /
Of charitable dileccion.
For if they will any man noye /
Either any body to destroy /
They are not of Christis eleccion.
Which after Luk evangelion /
Said to thapostels James and Ihon /
Nescitis cuius spiritus estis.
The son of man hidder came /
Not forto destroy any man /
But to save that perisshed is.
Wherefore let them do wonders /
By the devils their founders /
To lead men in blind cecite.
Yett never thelesse thou and I /
Would put our selves in ieopardy /
Against all their malignite.
To rake away their ouches /
Golden ryng and brouches /
Gevynge it unto the poor.

Wat. Thou excepst, S. Churbert of Duram /
With our lady of Walsyngam /
Also our lady of the Moore.

Ief. God being our direccion /
We would make none excepcion /
Against the devils enchauntment.
To do their best / let them not spare /
For we would make them full bare /
Of their precious ornament.

Wat. Our honest then destayned /
Suerly we should be proclaimed /
For outrageous heretyk.

Ief. Why more we then the Cardinal?

Wat. He attempteth nothing at all /
Soche matters in his bisshopryck.

Ief. I am sure thou have heard spoken /
What monasteries he has broken /
With out their fownders consent.
He subverteth churches / and chappells /
Taking a way bok and bells
With chalesces / and vestment.
He plucketh down the costly leads /
That it may rain on saynct heads /
Not sparynge god nor our lady.
Where as they red servyce divyne /
There is grou^tynge of pigges and swyne /
With lowynge of oxen and kye.
The aultres of their celebracions /
Are made pearches for hen^s and capons /
De foylynge them with their dirt.
And though it be never so profane /
He is counted a good christian /
No man doing him any hurtt.

Wat. A conscience if it be sothe /
That the Cardinal so does /
I wonder that he is not apeached.

Ief. O / church men are wyly foxes /
More crafty then iuggelers boxes /
To play ligier du main teached.
Yt is not for naught they feign /
That the two sweardes to them pertayne /
Both spretuall / and temporal.
Wherewith they play on both hondes /
Most tyrannously in their bonds /
Holding the world universal.
Against god they are so stobbourne /
That scripture they toss and turn /
After their own ymaginacion.
If they say the moon is belewe /
We must beleve that it is true /
Admittynge their interpretacion.

Wat. Art thou not a frayde to presume /
Against the Cardinals fume /
Seeing they will be all on his side?

Ief. No I do rather greatly rejoice /
That of a little worms voice /
Goddis judgment may be veryfyed.
Against soche a wicked brothell /
Which says / under his girthell /
He holds Kings and Princes.
To whom for a salutacion /
I will rehearce a brefe oracion /
dedicate unto his statlynes

Wat. Now gentell mate I the pray.

Ief. Have at it then with out delay /
Contempnynge his maliciousnes.
O miserable monster / most malicious /
Father of perversite / patron of hell.
O terrible Tyrant / to god and man odious /
Advocate of antichrist / to Christ rebel.
To the I speak / o caytife Cardinal so cruel.
Causles chargynge by thy coursed co^ma^dme^t
To brenne goddis word the wholly testament.
Godde word / grownd of all virtue and grace
The fructeous fode / of our faithful trust.
Thou have condemned in most carfull case /
Throw furions folly / falce and unjust.
O fearce Pharao / follower of flesshly lust.
What moved thy mind by malice to consent /
To brenne godd word / the wholly testament.
The tenoure of thy tyranny passes my brain
In every point evidently to endyght.
Nero nor herod / were never so noyus certain
All though of godd law they had little light
Shame it is to speak how against right.
Thy hatfull heart has caused to be brent /
Goddis true word / the wholly testament.
O perverse priest patriarch of pride /
Mortherer with out mercy most execrable.
O beastly brothell / of baudry the bryde /
Darlynge of the devil / greatly detestable.
Alas / what wretch would be so vengeable?
At any time to attempt soche impediment /
To bren^e godd word the wholly testament.
God of his goodenes / grudged not to dye /
Man to delyver from deadly dampnacion.
Whose will is that we should know perfetly
What he here has done for our salvation.
O cruel kayface / full of crafty conspiracion.
How durst thou geve then falce judgment
To brenne godd word / the wholly testament.
Thy leawednes of lyvynge is loath to hear /
Christis gospel to come unto clear light.
How be it surly it is so spread far and near
That forto let it thou haste little might.
God has opened our dercke dimed sight.
Truly to perceave thy tyran^ous intent /
To bren^e godd word the wholly testament.
Against thine ambicion all people do cry /
Po^pously spe^di^ge the sustenaunce of the pore
Thy haulte honor hyly to magnify /
Makes / theves / traitors / and many a whore
Woe worth the wretch of wickedness the door
Forger of our daily damage and detriment
To brenne goddis word the wholly testament.
O painted pastoure / of Satan the Prophet /
Kagynge courre / wrapped in a wolves skyn^e
O butcherly bishop / to be a ruler unmeet /
Maker of misery / occasion of sin.
God grant the grace now to begin.
Sf thy dampnable deeds to be penitent /
Bren^ynge goddis word / the wholly testament

Wat. No more for our lordis passion /
Thou raylest now of a fassion /
With rebuk most despytous /
No man shall these words advert /
But will judge them of an heart /
To proceed / most contumelious.

Ief. Though popisshe curres here at do barcke /
Yet thou may therein well marcke /
The will of god accomplesshed.
The Cardinal thus to reward /
Which with out any godly regard /
Desdayneth the trothe to be pupplisshed.
Therefore as he did the truth condemn /
So god will him and all his contempne /
With the swearde of punnysshment.

Wat. They had first some provocacion?

Ief. None wother then the translacion /
Of the english new testament.
Wherein the authors with mecknes /
Utterly avoydynge conviciousnes /
Demeaned them so discretly.
That with all their invencion /
They could find no reprehencion /
Resistynge goddis word wilfully.

Wat. How had the gospel first entrance /
Into England so far of distaunce /
Where to read him / no man may?

Ief. Good christen men with pure affecte /
Of god singulerly thereto elect /
With cost did him thither conveye.
Which / even as Christ was betrayed /
So with him the clargy played /
Through traiterous prodicion.

Wat. Who played the part of Judas*

Ief. The wholly bishop of Saynct Ass /
A post of Satan's iurisdiccion.
Whom they call Doctor standisshe /
Wone that is nether flesh nor fisshe /
At all times a common liar.
He is a babbling Questionist /
And a mervelous grett sophist /
Some time a lowsy graye friar.
Of sto^make he is fearce and bold /
In braulynge words a very scolde /
Menglynge vennem with sugre.
He despyseth the truth of god /
Taking part rather with falcehod /
Forto obtain worldly lucre.
In card playinge he is a good greek /
And can skyll of post and glyeke /
Also a pair of dyce to trolle*
For whordom and fornicacions /
He makes many visitacions /
His Dioces to pill and polle.
Though he be a stowte divyne /
Yett a pressed to keep a concubyne /
He there admits wittyngly.
So they pay their yearly tribut
Unto his dyvlisshe substitut /
Official / or co^missary.
To rehearce all his lyvynge /
God geve it yvell chevynge /
Or else some amendment shortly.

Wat. How did he the gospel betraye?

Ief. As soon as ever he heard say /
That the gospel came to England.
Immediately he did him trappe /
And to the man in the red cappe /
He brought him with strong hand.
Before whose proud consistory /
Bringing in falce testimony /
The gospel he did theare accuse.

Wat. He did mo persons represent /
Then Judas the traitor malivolent /
Which betrayed Christ to the Iues.

Ief. Thou may se of them in one manne /
Herod / Pilat / Cayphas / and Anne /
With their propertis several
And in another manifestly /
Judas full of conspiracy /
With the sects pharisaicall.
They are a grett deal more mutable /
Then Proteus of form so variable /
Which could him silfe so disgyse.
They can represent apes / and bears /
Lions / and asses with long ears /
Even as they list to divyse.
But now of standisshe accusacion /
Brefly to make declaracion /
Thus to the Cardinal he spoke.
Pleases your honorable grace /
Here is chaunsed a pitious case /
And to the church a grett lack.
The gospel in our Englisshe tongue /
Of lay men to be red and song /
Is now hidder come to remain.
Which many heretyk shall make /
Except your grace some way take /
By your authorite him to restrain.
For truly it is no handlynge /
For lay peoples understanding /
With the gospel to be busy.
Which many wone interprisynge /
Into heresy it did bring /
Disdaynynge the church vnreverently.

Wat. Tosshe / these sayng are sophistical /
I would hear the sense mystical /
Of these words right interpreted.

Ief. In faith with out simulacion /
This is the right significacion /
Of his meaning to be expressed.
O Cardinal so glorious /
Thou art Captain over us /
Antichristis chief member.
Of all our detestacions /
And sinful prevaricacions /
Thou alone / art the defender.
Wherefore healpe now or else never /
For we are undone for ever /
If the gospel abroad be spread.
For then with in a while after /
Every plowe manne and carter /
Shall se what a life we have led.
How we have this five hundred years /
Roffled them among the bryres /
Of desperate infidelite.
And how we have the world brought /
Unto beggary worsse then naught /
Through our chargeable vanite.
Which known / we shall be abhorred /
Reddi to be knocked in the forhed /
Our wealth taken away clean.
Therefore Tyrant play now thy part /
Seeing with the devil thou art /
Gretter then any manne has been.
Put the gospel a way quyght /
That he come not to lay men's sight /
Forto know goddis commandment.
And then we that are the re^menaunt /
Shall diligently be attendaunt /
To blind them with onre comment.
If they have once inhibicion /
In no manner of condition /
To read goddis word and his laws.
For us doctors of theology /
It shall be but a small mastery /
To make them foles and dawes.
Look what thou do by tyranny /
We will allow it by sophistry /
Against these worldly villaynes.

Wat. Now truly this is the meaning /
How soever be the speaking /
Of these spretuall lordaynes.

Wat. But what said the Cardinal here at?

Ief. He spoke the words of Pilat /
Saying / I find no fault therein.
How be it / the bisshops assembled /
Among them he examened /
What was best to determyn?
Then answered bishop Cayphas / Hoc est. London. Epu^s.
That agrett part better it was /
The gospel to be condemned.
Lest their vices manyfolde /
Should be known of young and old /
Their estate to be contempned.
The Cardinal then incontinent /
Against the gospel gave judgment /
Saying / to brenne he deserved.
Whereto all the bisshopp cried /
Answering / it cannot be denied /
He is worthy so to be served.

Wat. If they play thus their vages /
They shall not escape the plages /
Which to them of Rome happened.
At whose scourge so marvelous /
They would if they were gracious /
Gladly to be admonisshed.
To whom goddis word in purite /
Was first showed with humilite /
According to the veritable sense.
How be it they would not it receave /
But frawardly with swearde and gleave /
They expulsed it from thence.
Unto tyranny they did lean /
Wherefore god using another mean /
To bring them unto repentance.
He stered up some men's spryte /
Which their fautes did endyte /
Of their mischefe making vttraunce.
Yet would not they amend /
But moare wilfully did deffende.
Their evil life against goddis word.
Therefore as mislyvers obstinate /
They were destroyed now of late /
With pestilence and dent of sword.

Ief. Thou have rehearced three point /
Which will make all prestes joint /
For fear to trymble and shake.
Seeing that the first is past /
And the second comes in fast /
Their hypocrisi to awake.
And if they will not be refrayned /
The sword of vengeance unfeigned /
On their frawardnes will light.

Wat. Well / let us by no persuasion /
Geve no soche occasion /
Causynge christen men to fight.

Ief. No man will have that suspicion /
But take it for an admonicion /
Their unhappy life to repent.
Fo^^ye show as they shall find /
If god inspyre not their mind /
To labor for amendment.
Which by scripture to verify /
Let them read the prophet Jeremy /
In the chapter / four and twente.
How be it I will me hens hye /
Wheare as the Cardinals furye /
With his treasure shall not get me.

Wat. Is this proud Cardinal rycher /
Then Christ or good saynct Peter /
In whose room he does succeed?

Ief. The bosses of his mulis brydles /
Might bye Christ and his disciples /
As far as I could ever read.

Wat. Whether can thou then fly away?

Ief. To Constantinoble in Turkeye /
Among hethen my life to lead.

Wat. If thou will then live christenly /
Thou must use thy silfe prevely /
Or else surely thou art but dead.

Ief. I shall have theare as grett liberte /
As in wother placis of christente /
The truth of Christ to profess.
For he that will the truth declare /
I dare say much better he wear /
To be with them in hethennesse.

Wat. Though thou go never so far hence /
Yet with most terrible sentence /
To coursse the they will not mysse.

Ief. I ponder very little their courses /
For to god I say with humblenes /
They shall course / and thou shall bliss.

Wat. In their courses / is their no parell?

Ief. No for they do it in the quarrel /
Of their god which is their belly.

Wat. What mischevous god is that?

Ief. Wone that has eaten up the fatt /
Of england wealth so merry.

Wat. I will get me then into Wales /
To dwell among hills and dales /
With folk that be simple and rude.

Ief. Come not there I counsel the.
For the prestes / their simplicite /
Through craftynes do so delude.
That whosoever is so hardy /
To speak against prestes knavery /
For an herityke they him take.
Of whose miserable calamite /
Under the spretuall captivity /
I will here after a process make.

Wat. Then will I go into the realm /
Of the plenteous land of beam /
In the Cite of Prage to dwell.

Ief. Of two thing I will the warn /
Which thou must parfetly learn /
If thou will follow my counsel.
First beware in especial /
Of the outward man exteriall /
Though he show a fair aperaunce.
Many shall come in a lambis skin /
Which are ravisshynge wolves with in /
Ennemys to Christis ordinance.
The second is / if any reply /
Bringing in reasons obstinatly /
Against that which seems to be true.
Take no graduate for an authoure /
But remitt good master doctoure /
To the old testament or new.
And if he will bear the in hand /
That thou can not it understand /
Be cause of the difficulte.
Axe him how thou art able /
To understand a feigned fable.
Of more crafty subtilite?

Wat. I se thou know their secretnes /

Ief. Ye I could in their very lycknes /
Declare them if I had respyte.

Wat. Well I will depart / adue /

Ief. Now I beseech our lord Jesus /
To be thy gyde day and night.

In descripcio^ of the Arms / for wherefore read whereby.

Christ godd son / borne of a maiden (...) /
Forto save mankind / from heven descended.
Pope Clemente. the son of an whore /
To destroy man / from hell has ascended.

In whom is evidently comprehended.
The perfett meknes of our saveoure Christ /
And tyranny of the murderer Antichrist.
