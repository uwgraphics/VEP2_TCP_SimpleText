The Castle of pleasure.

Desire.

Beauty.

Pleasure.



The conueyaunce of a dreme how Desire went to the castle of pleasure / Wherein
was the gardyn of affection in habyted by Beauty to whom he amerously
expressed his love upon ye which supplycacyon rose great strife dysputacyon /
and argument between Pity and Dysdayne.

Coplande the prynter to the auctour.
Your mind considered / and your good intent
Theffecte regarded / in every manner case
your cyrcumstaunce / and labor dylygent
Who will construe / is of great effycace
your sentences morally tenbrace
Concerns reason of ^auryate grauyte
young tender hertes / tal^cte with amyte
your arge also flourynge in vyrent youth
So to bestow is greatly to commend
Books to endyte of matters right uncouth
Ensample gyuynge to all such as pretend
In tharte of love their minds to condescende
In terms fresh / their courage to endewe
Not with rude toys / but elegant and new
yet ben there many that little regard
your pleasures castle inhabyte with beauty
And I am sure would give but small reward
For this your labor / and studyous dyte
But had ye compyled some manner subtylte
Lucre to get / their neighbor to begyle
They would allow it a perfyte dyscrete style

Thauctour. My book of love / belonges to no such art
But to the pleasure / is his hoole affection
Of gentle people / which lyketh to take part
In pleasant youth / with amorous dyleccyon
Honor regarded / in clean cyrcumspeccyon
Layenge a part* all wylfull vain desire
To conforte them that brenne in loving fire

Coplande. Books of love innumerable prynted be
I mean of ladies / and many a hardy kynght
Without regard of sensual nycete
In love exploytynge / truly with all their might
But love of gold / these days blyndeth the sight
Of men and women / having their delight
Only for mede to do their appetyte.

Thauctour. Enprynt this book / Coplande at my request
And put it forth to every manner of state
It does no good lyenge still in my chyst
To pass the time some will bye it algate
Cause it is new / compyled now of late
At leest way young folk / will gladly seek recure
Beauty to get in the toure of pleasure.

Coplande. At your instaunce / I shall it gladly impresse
But the vtteraunce I think will be but small
Books be not set by their times is past I guess
The dyse and kardes / in drinking wine and and ale
Tables / cayles / and balls / they be now set a sale
Men let their children use al such harlotry
That byenge of books they utterly deny

Finit prologus
En passant le temps sans mal pencer.
TOrnyng and trauersynge hystoryes unsteadfast
In Ouydes books of transformacyon
It was my fortune and chance at the last
In ouertornyng of ye leaves to se in what fncyo^
Phoebus was inflamyd by inspyracyon
Of cruel cupyde to him immercyable
Which of him was worthy no commendacyon
Showing himself always deceyuable
Therefore I would gladly if I were able
The manner plainly and in few words dysclose
How phoebus and cupyd togyer were compenable
First it to show I will me dyspose
Phoebus set on pride and hault in courage
Spoke these words of great audacyte
Cupyde thou boy of young and tender aege
How may thou be ^o bold to compare with me
These arowes becomes me as thou may clearly se
Wherewith I may wound both man and best
And for that at all creatures be subgect to the
So much is thy power less than mine at each feste
Well well said cupyde it lyketh you to geste
This said / he assended to the mount pernassus
On the hight his arms shortly abroad he keste
And said I trust I shall this in haste dyscusse.
For a proof he took forth of his arowy quyuer
A golden darte with love right penytrable
Made sharp at the point that it might enter
With it he stroke phoebus with a stroke right lamentable
It to resyste he was weyke and unable
The stroke of his power who can or may resyste
But he must obey / and to love be agreeable
Co^streyned by cupyde which may stryke whom he list
Another darte he took soon in his fyste
Contrary to thoder ledyn blont and heavy
With this he stroke Phoebus love or she wyste
So that the more he desired the more she did deny
Her name was Daphnys which deuoyde of love
By dame saunce mercy which made him to complain
Cupyde in sundry wise his power did prove
On the one with love on thoder with dysdayne
The One did fle thoder would obtain
The One was glad thoder was in woe
The One was pencyfe and oppressed with pain
Thoder in Joy cared not though it were so
By fere and dysdayne she did him ouergo
Like to an hare she ran in haste
He followed like a grehounde desire wrought him woe
But all was in vain his labor was but waste.
The night drew nigh the day was at a side
My heart was heavy I much desired rest
When without confort alone I did abide
Seeing the shadows fall from the hills in the west
Each bird under boughe drew nigh to their nest
The chymneys from far began to smoke
Each householder went about to lodge his gest
The storke ferynge storms took the chymney for a cloak
Each chamber and chyst were soon put under lock
Curfew was ronge lyghtes were set up in haste
They that were without for lodging soon did knock
Which were plain p^cedentes ye day was clearly paste
Thus a sleep I fell by a sudden chance
When I lacked light alone without conforte
My sore study with slouthe did me enhaunce
Mine eyes were heavy my tongue without dysporte
Caused many fantasyes to me to resort
My heart was much musing my mind was varyau^t
So I was troubled with this ungracious sort
That my heart and mind to slouthe shortly did grant
About the which whiles I was attendaunt
Suddenly came Morpheus and at a brayde
Not affrayd but like a man right valiant
Couragyously to me these words he said.
Morpheus. Well known it is and noysed for a trothe
Though perchance it has not attained yet to your audyence
How Desire in mind has made a solemn oath
Beauty to serve without resistance
So to continue he does right well prepence
During his life with love steadfast and sure
In parfyte love to keep one contynuaunce
It is his mind to do her such pleasure.
On faruent love he set holy his mind
Love is his pleasure yet love puts him to pain
Much rule I ensure you has nature and kind
In him as is possible in one to remain
He would feign have release and dare not yet complain
Howbeit to such a point he is now brought
That either to show his mind he must shortly be feign
Or else his Joy is clearly sold and bought.
For the which it is done me to understand
That he will shortly now express his intent
And this they say he will take on hand
To go to her presence wherefore be dylygent
And walk with me and be obedyent
And I shall soon know how he shall speed
I must of duty hold me content
So ye supporte me always when I have need

The mountain of courage
This said suddenly by a chance repentyne
I was ascendynge a goodly mountain
About the which ye son over each side did shine
Whereof the color made my heart right feign
To se the golden valeyes both fair and plain
But when I to the top was nigh auaunced
None of my Joints could together contain
For Joy my heart leped and my body daunced.
What call ye this hill I pray you tell
This is the mountain of lusty courage
This has been inhabyted of many a rebel
As unkindness / enmyte / dysdayne / and dotage
But now they be dystroyed by marcy all apparage
So that now adays here dwells none
yet dysdayne has gotten a more stately advantage
For in the castle of pleasure she troubles many one.
Now goodly Iustes here on they excersyse
By thactyfnes of many a champyon
And these well gargaled galeryes they did deuyse
To thentente that ladies might have prospeccyon
And to such as were worthy grant love and affection
And also when their lust were their courage to use
To dance among them they took a dyreccyon
As they might well and not them self abuse
When I aduerted of these galeryes y^ quadra^t facyon
The meruaylous mountain so well made plain
Me thought that sith the incarnacyon
Was never seen a more goodly mountain
For Joy my heart leped I was so feign
Of it I was so joyous and so well appade
I could in no wise my mind refrain
To such time this as praise of it I made
O puyssaunt courage chief cause of conforte
Thou may well be nigh the castle of pleasure
O hill thupholder of all doughty dysporte
Of marcyall manhood thou art the treasure
Out of thy banks is gotten the bre
That causes the pastymes of parfyte prowes
O mountain god grant the long to endure
Sith thou art lantern of lasting lustynes.
So forth we walked on that goodly hill
To that we came to the banks side
To se the fair castle than we stood still
And to se the rennynge river there we did abide
To have a low water we tarried the tide
The name of this water then thus he did express
To dystroye chaungeable and people oppressed with pride
They call this water the lauer of lowlynes
On the stones of stedfastnes rennes this water clear
To overcome folks chau^geable and proud of heart and my^de
Such men shall be put in right great danger
For than swells the water contrary to his kind
So that they can not the steppynge stone find
By the mean whereof they be troubled so sore
With the wild wawes wauerynge with the wind
That for lack of help they are right soon forlore.
But blessed be god we came in good season
Well pass this same I trust we shall in haste
Be not flowyshe but arm you with reason
How ye shall get over in mind before well cast
To be to forward ye may soon make waste
So forth we went in pacyent humylyte
And when I this water was well past
I looked back and said this in breuyte.
O lowly lauer slydynge over the stones of stedfastnes
O ryall river which proves perfytely
All proud people that delytes in doublenes
Thou drownest them in thy stremys right shortly
Thou have a more praysable proprety
Then ever had the well of helycon
The mother of mekenes conserve the perpetually
Sith thou art the mother water of virtues many one
So when I toward the castle dyrected my look
Which then was not from me a full stones cast
I remembered that I had read in many a book
That in this place of pleasure were many a stormy blast
Notwithstondynge I thought all perils had be past
When I saw of this castle the royal gates
Yet before I knew that pleasour could not last
There as dysdayne is in favor with estates
This royal castle was on each side quadraunt
Gargaled with goodly grehoundes and beestes many one
The tyrannous tygre the strong and mighty elephaunt
With a castle on his back which he bare alone
The lions syry eyes with rubyes there shone
The golden grephyn with clees of asure
The unicorn allow with a rufull moan
Stood there as desolate of lively creature.
The walls were allectynge of adamantes
The wyndowes of crystal were well fortyfyed
And as I was lokynge on these elyphauntes
On the gates two scryptures I aspyed
Them for to read my mind than I applied
Written in gold and yndye blewe for folks furtherau^ce
They betoken two ways as after well I tried
These scryptures as I remember thus sowned i substance
Who as in to this place will take his entering
Must of these ways have fre eleccyon
if he list be lusty lepe dance and sing
Or if in worldly welthe he set his affection
In honor riches or prosperous inuencyon
He shall be conveyed if he will so ensewe
Else to the scripture underneath let him give intencyon
which is set out in letters of yndye blewe.
Who so does set his pleasure and delight
His faruent heart to conioyne steadfastly
On the love of Beauty a blossom right wit
Or on any of her ladies let him ententyfely
Be content his mind and courage to apply
To such as to conduyt all folks lies in wait
For none can without their leave pass them by
Nor yet attain to beautes high estate
This said my mind mused gretely
Which of these ways I was best to take
Whereby I called to remembrance shortly
How Hercules of aege but tender and wake
New at years of dyscresyon his mind sore brake
wha^ he saw two ways ye one of vtue ye other of pleasure
And of the night it caused him right often to wake
By cause he knew not the way of pefyte measure.
Yet such was his fortune right happy was his chance
Which took the way so much praysable
This to pleasure and welthe does men auaunce
This other does enduce one to be amyable
I am hereby much troubled my mind is unstable
what remedy shall I find to make my mind steadfast
I will endeuer me to reason to be conformable
All my wits serched I trust it so to cast
This golden scripture is right much pleasant
And has dampened the eyes of men many one
I am sore troubled to which way should I grant
Sith I am now here in manner as man alone
This love lasts when all riches is gone
Therefore I think it best with it to be content
Considering that few their mysfortune will moan
That have mo faces than hertes as daily is euydent.
My mind thus establysshed I was about to praise
This palace precious and castle right confortable
When I had chosen the surest of these ways
So than I was brought on an even table
For to go to beautye I was than agreeable
And the rather because of morpheus desire
Which said that to him company was deceyuable
This castle then thus praised I enflamed with loves fire
O precious palace of pryncely pulchrytude
Walled with admantes which draws by vyolence
According to thy power and thy stones fortitude
All things of iron / so this castle by influence
Draws to him hertes as I saw and did prepence
Therefore o castle Jesus the preserve
Lest by some pery we might be driven hens
For during life and health I entende the to observe.
When I was entered in to this ryall place
Confort me welcomed with an herty semblaunce
Saying what would ye that ye came to his place
Come forward and be not afraid your self to auaunce
To speak with desire I did me hyder enhaunce
She said desire is but a little past
I shall you to him bring if ye have good vtteraunce
I trust ye shall by my good help to se him in have.
So forth we walked within this base court grene
Ye shall se here she said many goodly pastymes
Ye shall have such Joy as often has not be seen
^^^utynge dauncynge balades and rymes
^^^gynge pypynge ye shall se at sundry times
All manner of gaming ye shall se excercysed
And upon all quarelles troubles and crimes
Right solemn Iustes be here often enterprysed
But what way will ye take I had forgot all this while
Whether will ye to the hall or to beauty now express
For here the ways parts I wos like you to begyle
In Beautyes presence I would feign be doubteles
Athen ye must be conveyed by my sister kyndnes
In deed sir I had like to have served you gently
But se where she goes let us make short our process
For to her presence bring you now will I
Good sister kyndnes I pray yon convey
This gentylman which says would speak with desire
At your request I can not say him nay
If it were in me to give him an hole empire
But is he I pray you enflamed with loves fire
That after desire he goes so fast appace
Tusshe this matter speed I hertly you require
And I shall tell you that in an other place.
Well good enough go ye about your besynes
Sir for comfort sake ye be right hertly welcome
Then conforte to the gate did her redress
For sorrow whereof I was in manner dumme
I was so mased yet when my mind was come
I thanked her in my hartyest manner possible
Besechynge god to send her such a some
As might recompense double and tryble.
What moeued you to come in to these parties
And I pray you by whom were ye hither brought
That ye have passed so well the Ieoperdyes
By the mean of Morpheus as now I hither sought
For I would have entered in though dear I hadit bought
One cause was fantasy I can not it deny
Sir hyder be ye welcome as hertely as can be thought
And I trust in haste ye shall se fantasy
This said I was nigh the gardyn of affection
Which apperyd to my sight both gay and glorious
Enuyronde with emyraudes to it a free proteccyon
The pereynge dyamonde the amatiste amorous
The steadfast Saphyr the blew turks right precious
With many other stones I lack co^nynge them to show
Me thought it a new paradyse delycate and delycyous
It shone so fresshly and bare so great auewe.
But where is Morpheus I merueyle yt I him lack
He was here with me not very long agone
By that I had this said I suddenly looked back
I saw him and an other stand talking alone
I pray you who is this I have not seen such one
It is fantasy to ye may se that folks of a quayntaunce
Where soever they mete the one will other moan
As these two do now without varyaunce.
Kyndnes than steppeth forth with a merry cou^tynaunce
Said sister fantasy why talk ye with this man
Ye had need be wise lest there happen such chance
As I fere not but well enough ye can
Well well said fantasy why do ye fere me than
But sister fantasy ye must let this man enter your ward
To speak with desire for his color is pale and wanne
Therefore to his return good sister be his sauegarde
Ye fere ye not but I will him well head
Ye would be gone well do and keep your charge
Lest there be some that of your help has need
For there is many one yt would give money right large
To have you at their pleasure always in their barge
That I well know and yet they get me not
And as ye said unto me head your own charge
Thus fare ye well and regard your chance and lot
Kyndnes departed yet her power was present
Away with fantasy enclosed in her heart
Than fantasy in at the gate did sprent
I leped in after and suddenly did sterte
When I saw me enclosed about with a couerte
Set full of myrt trees the apple tree appeared plain
Of pyramus and Thysbe dystroyed by loves darte
Which made me often to wysshe that I were out again
Alas quod I what sudden adventure
I se this world is but uncertain
I was late Ioyus as ever was creature
And now I foly^shly have locked me in loves chain
I wene I be i^ laborinthus where my notaurus did remain
A blind Cupyde is this thy guerdon
Make thou folks blind do thou so entertayne
Such lovers as sewe to the for their padon.
I had forgeten the process of alayne
I nothing regarded the verses of vyrgyll
Which says to hyde colors is but vain
The worst color often taken the fayrer abydes still
For these that be fair often change their will
Al things as they show is not in substance
Which I perceived now has done me much ill
That thus from the show has great varyaunce
What moved has your mind why morn ye thus alone
Have ye lost any friend or any other thing
Nay thabsens of conforte right sore I moan
Which said I should here folks both lute and sing
Thus she told me at our last partynge
And I can not se what way that should ensewe
For but if ye such pastymes to me bring
To all my Joy I may well say adewe.
Doubt ye not but ye shall se things pleasant
If ye will be content to for bear a little space
For conforte about no man contynually is attendau^te
None erthly creature shall still stand in her grace
Joy reconcyled after anger she follows apace
After a great pery the wether seems more clear
There is no man that has been in woeful case
But after that prosperyte is to him more dear.
None erthly pleasure may be atteyned without pain
Record the story in the tenth book of Ouyde
Rehearsed by Uenus to make Adonis of her feign
Now atalante sore set on pride
Out ran all folks she would none abide
They yt could out run her should have her in marriage
They yt could not were slain none spared nor set a side
This love was made egall to that anauntage
Many coragyous wowers did assaye this Ieoperdy
But all were dystroyed she did them over go
yet as hyppome^tes saw her moster pulde down the^ by and by
He said I blamed these wrong I knew not y^ reward so
As I do now / which works to me much woe
My fortune unprovided shall never be left alone
God always helps bold men and fortune also
I se thereby promoted men many one
So venus perceiving the fervent steadfastness
Of this true lover loathe that he should be lost
Put in his mind as Ouyde does express
To take two golden apples or three at the most
To throw down one of them she taught hy^ such a toste
When he ran against his lady yt she might it take
So wha^ at so^dry times he had throwe^ down all his cost
He out ran her and gate her to be his worldly make
Such was his fortune by his great boldness
Though it were to his pain yet it gate him pleasure
For Uenus in conclusyon does bold lovers redres
As ye may se daily in ure
This said we were in a gardyn right pure
Depaynted with blossoms of sundry odoures
Lo quod she how say ye have ye not now pleasure
To walk and know ye propertes of these goodly flowers
Pryncypally the prymrose above flowers all
With four leaves / and the roses these be most in value
Clicia was changed i^ to a marygold which is a memoryal
Of her lover the son for she does him ensue
At rysynge at setting among the drops of dew
Narcissus was changed in to a water cresse
Hiachynthus in to a flower delyse as ouyde does show
Rehersynge of the same flowers many a propre process.
This some thing pulles up my heart and encreseth my confort
Wherefore I will apply to you with due dylygence
Lo se here be all the flowers of love and dysporte
I had almoost forgote my self it were time I were hens
I will go and now present you to eloquence
Which is here by at the well of helycon
Me think I se her therefore as I prepence
Best is to present you now when she is alone
O famous flower O lady eloquence
Pleseth you to take with you this gentylman
So that ye may have such preemynence
As to him in no wise show I can
I hold me well content but there is a man
Named desire which would speak with my lady
There about I go / well good enough than
That ye have put it of so long meruell have I
Than she talked to me of blysses
Telling me that he was a man right eloquent
Than to lene at the herbar where Beauty sat at ese
It pleased eloquence / yet the bows were so bent
That we could not se through / yet fantasy was present
As we well herd by her communycacyon
And showing the manner of desires intent
She ordered her words much after this facyon.
Fantasy. O well of womanhede to us lady and maystres
Pleases your hyghnes of your aboundaunt grace
To know how Desire in right great heaviness
Required me to moeue you when I had space
That he might speak with you and to appoint time and place
When he might a wait on you and give you attendaunce
To show you all his grefe and in what woeful case
He does endure without dyssemblaunce.

Beauty. Ye know well fantasy I am nothing accompanied
Like as I would be when he shall attain my presence
Therefore as best is let this be applied
Go ye and call hither your sister credence
Let eloquence be nyghe lest there happeth some offense
For it is mete they be nyghe at this great besynes
Quod dysdayne it is mete my lady have preemynens
Like as becomes her estate and noblenes
Forth went fantasy to do her message
Desire thought he tarried very long
And sore he was moeued with faruent courage
He thought he would Ieoperde though it should happen wrong
And in his great trouble he called fantasye among
Saying ye forgete ye head not my great pain
If some chance have happed her I may sy^ge a woeful song
Or else I fere me she be let by dysdayne.
Between hope and dread thus troubled right
He stepte forth with a solemn semblaunce
Though I never attain her I will thus endure no more
So than forwards he did him self auaunce
Lo quod dysdayne se ye this sudden chance
Here is desire what sodeyn smoke caused this
Draw y^ trauers quod Beauty let us here this vtterau^ce
He entered and kneled down and spoke nothing amysse

The supplycacyon made by desire to Beauty.
O excellent empress which guydeth in your guardon
This goodly gardyn of amyable affection
Which also grants to true lovers pardon
All obstynate people ye subdue to correccyon
It is also in your power and eleccyon
Lovers to redres under Uenus ye have most power
By you they must be ordered after your dyreccyon
Which in your gardyn should gader any flower.
Pleases your hyghnes to give head and intent
To this expressing of my woeful pain
Late to sleep when I was dylygent
To me there happed a great cause to complain
None erthly conforte could in me remain
Cupyde had bewrapped mine heart so sore
To search mean to sleep it was but vain
I was never so troubled sith that time nor before.
To me there came as I well perceived
Late sent from Cupyde a golden darte right hot
Which perced me so sore when I it first received
That neither salues nor surgyens could help nor be my bote
They durst not search ye wound it lay at mine heart rote
And for that there was but one that could it remedy
It pleased me not than to go to here a mote
But often on Cupyde it caused me out to cry.
It was your love which was cause of all this
I can not deny it but show it in words plain
I durst to none erthy show my woo as it is
To overcome this fervent love I did my besy pain
But when I saw it auyled not than I was feign
To labor for socour then I thought it best
But yfones grace be showed none can sure health obtain
Thefore trusting on pity of this point I did rest.
Wherefore o lady preelecte pryncesse
On all lovers having the soueraynty
I hertely beseech you my woe to redress
The cause considered of my great ieoperdy
I trust ye nether will ne can this my request deny
For I have found such grace in your eyes or this
That if all the peril in the world should on it ly
I could not forbere but tell you as it is.
No worldly riches to you I can promise
Most I can say is that ye shall be my most conforte
But god which to al folks after their merits can deuyse
Reward or punishment most egally he does sort
He is the lord of pity Iusques a la mort
Give you reward and preserve you at all hours
Of perfyte love he bears a pryncy port
And to increase my Joy I ask no more but yours
Dysdayne A proud presumptuous person goes never without offense
ye have well acquyted you now ye have told this tale
It came of a high wit if ye well prepence
Within her own gardyn my lady to assaylle
Without her license it lyked you to rail
On cruel Cupyde your pride will have a fall
I trust to se you glad your bonet to avail
And among the waykest be put back to the wall
Like as a sodayn rebuke much greueth ones heart
Which late has begone to be aduenturous
So this caused desire sore astonyed to sterte
Saying I have attempted a thing right Ieopardous
To attain the presence of my lady most beautyus
I can make none answer nor utterly deny
That but I have presumed on a love precious
It in this case I blame but hope and fantasy
I know no remedy what is best to be done
But if pity with this pryncesse be present
I may as well else go muse about the moon
As hither to come to show mine intent
As long as dysdayne contynueth ill content
Wherefore for pity I hertly call and cry
That she were with beauty me think it expedyent
To dysdayne in open audyence then spoke pity

Pity. what moeueth you dysdayne this man this to reprove
Which I am sure came in none ill intent
But to express and repress his mind and faruent love
Has he any ungoodly words i my ladies presence spent
I perceive no pride in him me thinks him dylygent
And if ye have any cause in him now speak
If not* I assure you I can not be content
That with unsitting words ye should his heart thus break

Dysdayne. Fair maystres I made not these words on my fyngers
Wene ye I would speak them and have no ground whereon
But first I will say I shrewe his first bryngers
In ye parlour without the gate he might have stand alone
But I will tell you my causes sith ye be such one
As must have accomptes / nay thereof ye shall pardon me
I will seek for an other which shall my trubles moan
I will first know your rule / what wot ye where ye be

Pity. Ye well enough it seems better then you
Except to reason ye be more conformable
It is my ladies power our reasons to allow
I take no such thnge on me I know I am not able
I have neither power ne commandment but as is agreeable
To my ladies pleasure but by reasons to make argument
That such reasons well weyed my mind may be stable
And by contraryous reasons to search out his true intent

Dysdayne. I am content to put my cause in to my ladies hands
As it shall please her I must hold me content
But I owe you no service I hold of you no lands
To show you my cause before my lady I consent
Let her order me as she shall think conuenyent
Why should he come without leave to her presence
Answer to this as ye think expedyent
Me think to my lady he has done a great offense.

Pity The cause considered I trust ye will say
That when he came hither he minded no dyspleasure
As to ward my lady he came for the next way
And as in his words he has ordered him by measure
He neither sought hither for gold ne treasure
But cupyde constrained his courage to make more haste
And but if ye find some other cause then this I am sure
For this my lady will not him out of her favor cast

Dysdayne. Forther he has made a great exclamacyon
Complaining on cupyde calling him cause of his woe
Saying in this wise or much after this facyon
The golden darte of Cupyde constreyneth melo
I can not se by what mean it should be so
Saying he desires my lady it to redress
For than he should have sought to Uenus as many one do
And have made his complaynt to that excellent goddess

Pity. And if ye well consider he is worthy more praise
That he to my lady made his supplycacyon
Than if he had compassed her by more crafty ways
It comes of a good courage and he is worthy conmendacyon
That he dare speak and trust to have no replycacyon
Again his mind fervent love was cause of this
The which in him had so great operacyon
To make him tell the troth were it well or amysse.

Dysdayne. Wene ye he be so feruente nay I warau^t you he shall live
If never more trouble came to his heart
Wene ye without cause he would to her love give
Not knowing her mind to make him so to smerte
He can well enough feign love Ouyde laid aparte
De art amandi which techeth one to love
Or else the squire of venus did him in the evening starte
And so to cast his fantasy him suddenly did moeue

Pity. Nay his color dyscryueth of love the fervent fire
He is not crystened that can such countynaunce feign
Iupyter which had subdued many to his empire
As suddenly with love Cupyde did him retain
And when he to danaes in a golden shoure did compain
His grefe considered and well known for a trothe
She granted him love and caused him to remain
What will ye have forther than sure promise and oath

Dysdayne. As for promise and oath I little them regard
For as it is said words is nothing but wind
Was not paris false of promise and hard
When to Enone he was so unkind
Which by a solemn oath to her did him bind
That he would mary her in all goodly haste
But when the golden apple. iij. goddesses did find
His Judgment fulfilled his words proved but waste

Pity. He was enflamed but by adventure
His pouerte made him content his mind to express
yet when of his Judgment he had theffect and pleasure
None of his deeds accorded shortly nor in process
But the deeds of Desire followed doubtless
For according to his words he made great labor
Hertely requyrynge my lady him to redress
Promising her the vtterest of his little power.

Dysdayne. Perchance that was more for riches than for love
Or because of her great parentage he did to her sewe
So many one has done as by experyence I can prove
Which appears so euedently yt I need no exe^ples show
Mo laboreth for lucre when a thing is fallen new
Than by fervent love to attain hault noblenes
Which causes often ladies in heavy case to rewe
And be more ware to whom they their minds express

Pity. Though many one have so done can ye think in your reason
That desire so entendyd when he hither came
Consider it well and ye will think at this season
It was faruent courage that brought him to his blame
Which had such power in him yt he less fered shame
Where as if he had sued for riches he would not so have done
As ye may understand and if ye regard his name
Ye will say that pure love was cause of it alone.

Dysdayne. Admytte it was for love yet many are chaungeable
Though long it has continued in approved kyndenes
Was not Jason to Medea long agreeable
yet after it changed he refused her in process
What cruel heart had he which for her gentylnes
In none other wise did her recompense
He regarded neither kynred nor noblenes
This well considered who would to them give credence

Pity. ye may not blame all though some be chaungeable
I can tell you hystoryes of lovers right steadfast
Pyramus and Thysbe continued very stable
As long as life did in their bodies last
When the one was deed thoder to death did haste
Love surely conjoined is a great pleasure
Than why should ye all lovers out of favor cast
Sith Thysbe of Pyramus had so great a treasure

Dysdayne. All these hystoryes are not proof suffycyent
Sith hystoryes of both parts are right notable
Therefore with these reasons I will not be content
But I will you put a questyon good and reportable
Whether love coming by effeccyon be more durable
Or love comy^ge by condicyons heron shall be our argument
Me think love coming by condycyons is less varyable
How think ye now speak show your mind and intent

Pity. Me think contrary and for this reason
That love coming by effeccyo^ should endure a le^ger space
Love is a comoynynge of two hertes for a season
Though perauenture they co^tynue not long in a place
Yet in their absence such love increases a pace
where as if it came by condycyous it could not reuyue
But if so were they might be in such case
That they might continue together all their live.

Dysdayne yes the remembrance thereof remains in memory
And contynueth long to their great conforte
In what frendely manner and how gentylly
His love to him did at sundry times resort
Fyndyge with him goodly pastymes and dysporte
Having no lust from him to dysseuer
Me think of such as are of this sort
Love should continue and last for ever.

Pity More surely enprynted is and conjoined steadfastly
The love by effeccyon enters the heart more deep
Than of the other for they rest quyetly
where thoder oftymes breketh many a sleep
It is so penytrable and so subtylly does crepe
Upon a man which makes it so stable
Where in thoder if one such corn did repe
He would to her be as well agreeable.

Dysdayne. Perauenture he thynkes such condycyons be in none
As in his love so substancy all and steadfast
He weneth she be incomperable a lone
So yt all worldly storms can not blow down his mast
Not Eolus if he came with his most stormy blast
Nor thesyphone could cause between them dyscorde
So durably he trustes that love will last
He weneth that Cupyde be so contynuall a lord

Pity. Consider the ground and than it dyscus
Where the ground fails can be no suraunce
Cessante causa cessat et effectus
Take away the condycyons where is the remembrance
All is clean gone but where affection does enhaunce
There is no change but love perpetual
No dyspleasure can dyspoynt their desired dalyaunce
But be entered in the book of fame to be memoryall

Thauctour. Dysdayne to speak was very desirous
Had not credence interrupted his language
Which made such haste to her lady amerrous
That somthynge she poynted because of her vyage
For the which she like a woman right sage
Made a pause and spoke in words compendyous
And telling she was comen according to her message
And in this wise she spoke in words effectuous

Credence. It pleases your grace of your benevolence
To dyrect to me by fantasy your letters myssyue
Whereby I considered and right well did prepence
That I without contradyccyon excuse or strife
Should resort to your presence sith I during my live
Am bound to your conmaundeme^t yet have I done offense
But I did it for this intent else me from life depryue
That me thought it not mete to give hasty eredence

Beauty. I repute no blame in you ye came in good season
ye have well aspyed your time I hold me content
your excuse I allow it is grounded on reason
Here has been much besynes sith ye hens went
Now I will declare my pleasure sith ye be present
As touching desire after whose supplycacyon
Between Pity and Dysdayne has been a sore argument
Till ye interrupted their co^munycacyon
Pity and dysdayne give ye good audyence
And ye desire take this for an answer
Sith now is common tome credence
I will no lenge make delay nor defarre
But I command you two to cese your plees and war
And you desire I will to my favor take
Sith me to please adventure so well ye darre
I were to blame if I should you forsake
Forther I will that ye enjoy and proceed
The most part of this gardyn of affection
if ye lack any thing ye shall have it at need
And for the tender zele amyte and dyleccyon
That I have to you ye shall have proteccyon
Over me and mine during my mortal life
I will moreover be subdued to your correccyon
if it like you to mary me and have me to your wife

Thauctour. O noble words joyous and confortable
Prudence propre pastyme pleasure and prouysyon
In this good lady were right notable
From dotage dysdayne danger and derysyon
I wene she was preserved by some vysyon
For the which desire of good and herty mind
Spoke these words without mysprysyon
His mind expressing by words propre and kind

Desire. Oprecyous pryncesse of preelecte pulcrytude
I can not compass your compassyble kyndnes
When it has pleased your benygnyte and gratytude
That I might enter your gardyn my mind to expres
I am of no such abylyte as ye make me doubtless
But sith ye have enhabled me of your benygnyte
God reward you yt it has pleased you to enhaunce my dygnyte.
The eternal god reward you accordyngly
if any of his powers regard folks petyouse
if Justice be in any place acquyted duly
O what world brought forth your body delycyouse
What parents gate such one to be so amerouse
your cou^tenau^ce does rejoice me and encreseth my myrthe
your virtue proves your parentage to be of noble birth
As long as ye flodes run with water vyolent
As long as shadows shall about hills appear
And while there shall be any sterres in the fyrmament
So long shall your love my heart and body stere
your honor and name shall be expressed without fere
Sith ye be not varyaunt but stedrast and substancyall
Therefore god you acquyte with Joy perpetual.

Thauctour. This said he was auau^ced by commandment of beauty
To her own sete the chair of preemynence
Where as dysdayne was so enuyouse and anger
That she fared as one without intellygence
Saying I will nolenger tarry I will go hens
Sith that as soon is auaunced aman of yesterdaye
Having no good property as one that without offense
Has continued from young aege in service always.
Than she turned her back full skornfully
And toward the gates she hyed a hasty pace
And from thens she was conveyed by fantasy
To that she was clean without the palace
Than pity said what sorry grace
Where is dysdayne is she gone without leave
For sothe that were a very heavy case
yet I trust it should not many folks grieve.
Noise rumor and fame went shortly all abroad
Within the garden that dysdayne was clearly gone
which caused many lovers that made long abode
To complain to their ladies they went all alone
They fered than nothing but made their moan
And sone were sped and went out at the gate
where as before there could not have passed one
Fantasy stood always so contynuall thereat.
which lyberty increased among them such Joys
That me thought I herd ye sownynge of many an instrument
Which great tryumphe and penytrable noise
Caused Morpheus to vanysshe incontinent
Because it was not necessary he should be present
But avoid from thens where is noise and company
When he was gone I waked and suddenly did sprent
So astonyed I knew not where I was perfytely.

Morpheus vanysshed thauctour speaks in ths wise
The day was common and kest a dymme light
The son under clouds by weder tempestyouse
Orryble thonder and lyghtnynge sore troubled my sight
And therewith a betynge shour a storm rygorouse
Waked me out of sleep it was so Ieoperdouse
And where as I wened I had be waked with mynstrelsy
It was contrary which made my mind so troublouse
That I could no way rest neither sith stand ne lie
Than I remembered all my dreme and fantasy
Saying for the remembrance of this sudden change
I entende to write the manner hereof right shortly
That folks may consider this world is but strange
yet to the wyndowe I walked a soft pace
Often syghynge and sobbing with an heavy heart
To se where I could espy of pleasure the palace
Or of thynhabytauntes thereof perceive any part
Either conforte or kyndenes which made me to smerte
Fantasy or eloquence which did desire forder
P^te with Beauty was when I did thus depart
I looked for their places where they stood in order*
if I could se Credence walking in any brother
I looked for all these yet I saw none alas
Which brought to mind words of salomo^ of wisdom recorder
Uauitas vanitatu^ and oi^a mu^di vanitas.
Where is Sampson for all his great strength
Or where is the sage Solomon for all his prudence
Death has and will devour all at lenth
For where is ulysses for all his eloquence
Where became Crassus for his riches and opulence
Where is lucres for all her chastyte
Where is alexander which subdued to his obedyence
Much of the world by his marcyalyte
Where is Tully which had pryncypalyte
Over all orators in parfyte rethoryke
Where be all the.iiij. doctors of dyuynyte
Where is arystotyll for all his philosophy and logyke.
Be not all these departed from this transytory life
yet them to diverse places our creator did name
With egall Judgment without debate or strife
According to their merytes he did reward or blame
Therefore for your souls health use virtue and dread shame
And as to the world labor always for love
That ye may perpetually reyne in good fame
It shall be to you all riches above
As by experyence oftymes it does prove
Of such as have had subgets without love them to dread
From they be of power than they do their mind remove
And so their masters fail when they have need
And ye that will be lovers of ladies amyable
ye may not be sleuthfull but about them dylygent
And always to their pleasures ye must be agreeable
if ye intend their minds to content
But first fyxe your mind there as it may be well spent
Be secret and steadfast without mutabylyte
Be bold and couragyous fulfill their commandment
With a quycke and hasty speed as ye by possybylyte
May or can nothing is better than agylyte
With contynuall presence nothing can help more
For Ouyde says else your love shall not rest in tra^quylyte
Uanescetque absens et nouus intrat amor.
These reasons reuolued in my remembrance
When that sorrow was somthynge modefyed
Than great trouble my mind did enhaunce
what should be cause that I had be occupied
with this dreme yet shortly I aspyed
That this amerous study of Cupyde and Phoebus
was cause thereof which could not be denied
Therefore in mind I did plainly duscus
That I would study no more and specially thus
I would muse no more in the evening so late
But conclude this shortly in words compendyous
Lest I should be as I was erste in miserable estate
Uolunte ie ay mais ie ne veulx mon cuer chaunger.
Thenuoye.
Go humble style submytte the to correccyon
Be not so bold to presume to the presence
Of any but such as be enuyronde with effeccyon
Let them arrect their eeres to rebuke thy negligence
To them thou perteynest of due congruence
Let them more curyously thy rural terms affyle
How thou sholdest be amended they have best intellygence
Therefore submytte the to them my poor and humble style
if any that be more sad delytynge in grauyte
And if forther age would again the give euydence
Saying they were well occupied yt were troubled with the
wrote not Ouyde in as low style which if they prepence
They may think yt I to avoid of slouthe the vyolence
Made this without cloak or rethorycall language
Thinking that I ought not of due conuenyence
write the in so high style as wise stories and sage.
