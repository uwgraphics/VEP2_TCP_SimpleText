The Vale Man's Table.
Herein is taught even for the capacity of the meanest, how to draine Moors,
and al other wet grounds or bogges, and lay them dry for ever. How to measure
without an instrument any roufe ground, wood, or water, that you cannot come
into. Also here is annexed the compass and the scale, with part of the use of
the said compass, and the computation of years from William the Conqueror.

TO THE READER.
WHereas diverse ignorant in Arethmaticke and Geomatrie, think it a hard thing
to describe that small work of mine, entitled the Terrar, which I set forth
the last year, 1582. And the rules thereof so hard, that they cannot be
learned without tedious travel. Truly (gentle Reader) were it not for the
obscure words of Art, they were most pleasant and easy. And for proof thereof
if thou can but read: I have appointed one whom you may hear off, at the
sign of the Lamb near Cleme^ts Inn, who shall teach thee so much
Arethmaticke, and Geomitry in one day, having a good capasity, as shall
describe the said Terrar, the Map of a Country, or any such like work, with
the use of the scale. And also he will teach thee any thing mentioned in it, to
be taught with as much expedition as thou would wish. Condemn me not before
thou have tried me, and then report as thou find me. I know some that would
have none cunning but them selves, who would make mountains of their mould
hills. Such will smoothly laugh me to scorn. But I trust the modest minded by
proof will be witnesses of my truth. And as touching the rest of the twentye
and five devises which I offer to teach in the said Terrar, I promise thee,
there is not one amongst them all, but is as easy to be learned as any of the
works herein described Wherefore let not words of Art dismay thee, nor those
that would have all men ignorant but them selves discourage thee: but lay hold
on slip pery time, which once misspent may no way be reuolked. And consider with
the Ant, that summer harvest, will provide both food and fire for winter cold.
And thus fare well in Christ. From Pains End, the 16. of November. 1583.

Whereas the said Terrar was sold for two shillinges six pence, contrary to
the Aucthours mind, from hence forth they shall be sold by retaile for six
pence a piece, you may have them at my Printers.

How to (...) ^^auel of any (...)at, is de(...) in the making of ponds upon
high and dry grounds by me already published in print. Which skill is
needful for them that will drayne bogs and weate grounds, for the better
finding of the most convenient current, to convey the water away. It is learned
with twice reading over of ten lines.

The compass.
compass rose

Note that this figure is set in most Maps, to describe the winds, viz. The
North south, East, and West quarters with their parts. The North point marked
with the flower Deluse, commonly standing with the face, or upper part of the
Map. So by this compass to any work annexed, you may know how it lies,
remembering that the point marked with the flower Deluce stands North. Then
tourning your face with that point you shall look into the North. So is your
back South, your right hand East, and your left hand, West.

THE cankred Carle in fertile soil,
which does much ground possess,
And suffers not the Plough-mans toil,
his land to take and dress.
Nor yet himself convert the same,
unto his Countries use,
Deserves well the shameful name,
of commonweals abuse.
And to a Dog I him compare,
that in the Manger lies;
Which laboring Stead from prouen share
by barking he denies.
Yet will not eat of that himself,
whereof poor Stead is glad.
Such members vile in common wealth,
were better lost then had.
To draine wet grounds.
First draw a strait ditch, one foot deep, and four inches broad, in the
most convenient place of your ground. Then draw from your strait ditch two
perch a sunder, slope drayners as this figure does represent. Dig them one
foot deep at the least, and one foot broad in the bottom, and not above two
inches broad at the top, so will the top close up again, and the bottom will
be hollow, wherein the water will soake into the strait ditch: which ditch, you
must fill with stones, or great gravel, and so must you fill five foot of the
ends of the sloape drainers next to the strait diche, and if stones be
plenty to fill the drainers throughout with stones is best. Where you fill
them with stones, you may cover them with thick turff, and make it plain, so
shall you lose no ground The charges for 10. Acres, is but 26. shil. 8. pence,
besides carriages, which charges, the earth that you cast out of the ditch and
drayners, being well spread, will counteruail for the manuring of the ground.



To draine Bogs.
In the firm ground within two yardes of the bog, draw a ditch from the
highest part a long by the bogs side, as the current goes and continue your
ditch until it comes out at naught, as here is debscribed. Make your ditch
as narrow as you can, dig it one foot lower then the spring which feeds the
bog. Then fill your ditch two foot thick with stones, and upon the stones,
throw in the earth, and cover the top with turffe which you dug out of the
ditch, so shall you spoil no ground, and the water, which was the cause of the
Bogge, will alter his course and run in the ditch among the stones, and in
short time the Bogge will sink, and prove firm, and very fruiteful ground.

How to measure a wood, and not to come into it.
Draw adjoining to the water or wood whereof you would, know the contents
either a square, a long square or a triangle, such as you may most conveniently
include your desired piece into. Then measure the whole plat, and from the
contents thereof: deduct the overplus, as for example in this long square
herafter described. The whole contents is 60. Acres, vvherof you must deduct 3.
acres for the long square at the East end, 5 Acres for the right triangle on
the Southvvest part, and 14. for the blunt triangle on the North side. So
testeth for the contents of the vvood 38. Acres.



The perfect use of the scale may be learned by him that can not read, having
a good capacity, in the space of 3. hours* yet by it are most strange works
done, which to the ignorant seem impossible. It is necessary that it be
taught by demonstrations for a little showing in this cause is a great deal
better then much reading.

The Scale.
20 60 100

A Computation of years, from William the Conqueror. Wherein you may find
the year of our Lord, the Dominicall letter, the leap year, the names of the
Kings successively, what day they began, how long they did reign, with the
days of their deaths. The dates of Records, or evidence, and of what
continuance they be: as for example.
I have a lease for 99. years, from Michaelmas, in the 10. year of King
Henry the 7. The question is, how many years are to come in the said lease
at Michaelmas 1583. First seek King Henry the 7. and then the tenth year of
his reign, which you shall find in the year of our Lord 1494. The which
number substract out of 1583. So shall you find 89. years past, and ten
years to come. If you cannot substract, then tell from 1494, until you come
unto 1583. And you shall find as is aforesaid, and thus for all others.

Anno Domini. The dominicall Letter. The names of the kings, and the month
they begone. The years of the Kings.
