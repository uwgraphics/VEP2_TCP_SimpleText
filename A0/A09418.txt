THE Foundation of Christian Religion, gathered into six Principles.

And it is to be learned of ignorant people, that they may be fit to hear
Sermons with profit, and to receive the Lords Supper with comfort.

Psalm. 1.19.30. The entrance into thy words shows light, and gives
understanding to the simple.

Printed by Thomas Orwin, for John Porter. 1591.

To all ignorant people that desire to be instructed.
Poor people, your manner is to sooth up your selves, as though ye were in a
most happy state: but of the matter come to a just trial, it will fall out far
otherwise* For ye lead your lives in great ignorance, as may appear by these
your common opinions which follow.

1 That faith is a man's good meaning and his good serving of God.

2 That God is served by the rehearsing of the ten commandments, the Lords
prayer, and the Creed.

3 That ye have believed in Christ ever since you could remember.

4 That it is pity that he should live which does any whit doubt of his
salvation.

5 That none can tell whether he shall be saved or not certainly: but that
all men must be of a good belief.

6 That howsoever a man live, yet if he call upon God on his death bed, and
say, Lord have mercy on me, and so go away like a Lamb, he is certainly saved.

7 That, if ani^ be strangely visited, he is either taken with a Planet, or
bewitched.

8 That a man may lawfully swear when he speaks nothing but the truth: and
swears by nothing but that which is good, as by his faith or troth.

9 That a Preacher is a good man no longer than he is in the pulpet. They
think all like themselves.

10 That a man may repent when he will, because the Scripture says, At what
time soever a sinner does repent him of his sin, etc.

11 That it is an easier thing to please God than to please our neighbor.

12 That ye can keep the Commandments, as well as God will give you leave.

13 That it is the safest, to do in Religion as most do.

14 That merry ballads and books, as Scoggin, Beuis of Southampton, etc. are
good to drive away time, and to remove heart quames.

15 That ye can serve God with all your hearts: and that ye would be sorry
else.

16 That a man need not hear so many Sermons, except he could follow them
better.

17 That a man which comes at no Sermons, may as well believe, as he which
hears all the sermons in the world.

18 That ye know all the Preacher can tell you: For he can say nothing, but
that every man is a sinner, that we must love our neighbors as our selves,
that every man must be saved by Christ: and all this ye can tell as well as he.

19 That it was a good world when the old Religion was, because all things were
cheap.

20 That drinking and bezeling in the alehouse or tavern is good fellowship,
and shows a good kind nature.

21 That a man may swear by the Mass, because it is nothing now: and byr
Lady, because she is gone out of the country.

22 That every man must be for himself, and God for us all.

23 That a man may make of his own whatsoever he can.

24 That if a man remember to say his prayers in the morning (though he never
understand them) he has blessed himself for all the day following.

25 That a man prays when he says the ten Commandments.

26 That a man eats his maker in the Sacra.

27 That if a man be no adulterer, no thief, nor murderer, and do no man harm,
he is a right honest man.

28 That a man need not have any knowledge of religion, because he is not book
learnd.

29 That one may have a good meaning, when he says and does that which is
evil.

These and such like sayings, what argue they but your gross ignorance? Now,
where ignorance reigns, there reigns sin: and where sin reigns, there
the devil rules: and where he rules, men are in a damnable case.

Ye will reply unto me thus, that ye are not so bad as I would make you: if
need be you can say the Creed, the Lords prayer, and the 10. commandments:
and therefore ye will be of Gods belief say all men what they will, and you
defy the devil from your hearts.

I answer again, that it is not sufficient to say all these without book,
unless ye can understand the meaning of the words, and be able to make a
right use of the Commandments, of the Creed, of the Lords prayer, by applying
them inwardly to your hearts and consciences, and outwardly to your lives and
conuersations. This is the very point in which ye fail.

And for an help in this your ignorance, to bring you to true knowledge,
unfeigned faith, and sound repentance: here I have set down the principal
points of Christian Religion in six plain and easy rules, even such as the
simplest may easily learn: and hereunto is adjoined an exposition of them word
by word. If ye do want other good directions, then use this my labor for your
instruction: A direction for the ignorant.
In reading of it first learn the six principles, and when ye have them
without book, and the meaning of them withal, then learn the exposition
also: which being well conceived, and in some measure felt in the heart, ye
shall be able to profit by Sermons, whereas now ye cannot: and the ordinary
parts of the Catechism, namely, the ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lords
prayer, and the institution of the two Sacraments, shall more easily be
understood.

Thine in Christ Jesus, William Perkins.

The foundation of Christian Religion, gathered into six Principles.
Question. WHat do thou believe concerning God.

I. There is 1. Cor. 8.6.
one Romans 1.20. act. 14.17.
God Heb. 11.3. genesis 1.1.
creator and Math. 10.30. pro. 15.3.
governor of all things, Matthew. 3.12. 1. John. 5.7.
distinguished into the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

Q. What do thou believe concerning man: and concerning thine own self.

II. Romans 3.10.
All men are wholly corrupted with Ephesians. 4.17, 18. genesis 6.5.
sin through Romans 5.12.
Adams fall: and so are become Ephesians. 2.2. heb 2.14. 2. Cor. 4.4.
slaves of Satan, and Gal. 3.10.
guilty of eternal damnation.

Q. What means is there for thee to escape this damnable estate?

III. Jesus Christ John 1.14. heb 2.16.
the eternal son of God, being made man, by his Esaias 53 5.
death upon the Cross, and by his Romans 5.19. 2 cor. 5.21.
righteousness, has perfectly Acts 4.1.
alone by himself, accomplished all things that are needful for the
salvation 1. John 2.2
of mankind.

Q. But how may thou be made partaker of Christ and his benefits.

IIII. A man Esaias 57.15* psa. 51.17
of a contrite and humble spirit Mar. 5.13
by faith alone, John 1.12. and 6.35
apprehending and applying Christ with all his merits unto himself, is
justified Romans 4.3, 6, 7 act. 15.9 1. Cor. 1.30
before God and sanctified.

Q. What are the ordinary means for the obtaining of faith.

V. Faith Romans 10.14. prouer. 28.19. hosea 4.6.
comes only by the preaching of the word, and increases daily by it, as
also Romans 4.11. 1. cor. 10.1.
by the administration of the Sacraments, and Romans 10.13.
prayer.

Q. What is the estate of all men after death?

VI. All men Ioh. 19.25.
shall rise again with their own bodies to the last Eccle. 12.14. matt. 12.36.
judgment, which being ended 2. Pet. 2.7. ezech. 9.4.
the godly Matt. 25.32.
shall possess the kingdom of Heaven: but unbelievers and reprobates shall be
Matt. 25.41.
in hell tormented with the devil and his Angels, for ever.

The Exposition of the Principles.
I.
Question.

WHat is God?

A. GOD is a Ioh. 4.24.
spirit, or a spiritual substance, most wise, most holy, eternal, infinite.

Q How do you persuade your self that there is such a God.

A. Besides the testimony of the Scriptures, plain reason will show it.

Q. What is one reason?

A. When I consider Romans 1.20. act. 14.17.
the wonderful frame of the world, me thinks the silly creatures yt be in it
could never make it: neither could it make itself: and therefore besides al
these, the maker of it must needs be God. Even as when a man comes into a
strange Country, and sees fair and sumptuous buildings, and yet finds no
living creatures there beside birds and Beasts, he will not imagine that
either Birds or Beasts reared by those buildings, but he presently conceiues
that some men either were or have been there.

Q. What other reason have you?

A. Romans 2 15. genesis 38.10. and 13, 14.
A man that commits any sin, as murder, fornication, adultery, blasphemy,
etc. albeit he does so conceal the matter, that no man living know of it, yet
oftentimes he has a griping in his conscience, and feels the very flashings
of hell fire: which is a strong reason, to show that there is a God, before
whose judgment seat he must answer for his fact.

Q. How many Gods are there?

A. No 1. Cor. 8.6.
more but one.

Q How do you conceive this one God in your mind?

A. Not Deuteronomy. 4.16. amos 4.13.
by framing any image of him in my mind (as ignorant folks do, that think
him to be an old man sitting in heaven) but I conceive him by his properties
and works.

Q. What be his chief properties?

A. First, he is Job. 12.13.
most wise, understanding all things aright, and knowing the reason of them.
Esaias. 6.3. exodus 20.5.6.
Secondly he is most holy, which appears in that he is most just and
merciful unto his creatures. Thirdly, he is eternal, Isay. 41.4.
without either beginning or end of days. Lastly, he is infinite, Psalm. 139.
all
both because he is present in all places, and because he is of power
sufficient to do whatsoever he Job. 9.4. deuteronomy 10.17.
will.

Q. What be the works of God?

A. Iere. 10.12. psalm. 33.6.
The creation of the world, and of every thing therein, and the preservation of
them being created by his special providence.

Q. How know you that God governs every particular thing in the world by his
special providence.

A. To omit the Matt. 10 30. prou. 16.33.
Scriptures, I see it by experience: Leuit. 26.26 matt. 4.4.
Meat, Drink, and clothing being void of life, could not preserve the life
of man, unless there were a special providence of God to give virtue unto
them.

Q. How is this one God distinguished?

A. 1 John 5.7. matthew. 3.12.
Into the Father which begets the Son: into the Son who is begotten of
the Father: into the holy Ghost, Ioh. 15.26.
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.

II.
Q. Let us now come to our selves, and first tell me what is the natural estate
of man?

A. Every man is by nature, Ephesians. 2.1. 1. tim. 5.5.
dead in sin as a loathsome carrion, or as a dead corpse lies rotting and
stinking in the grave.

Q. What is Sin?

A. Any 1. Ioh. 3.4. romans ^.7. gal. 3.10.
breach of the Law of GOD, if it be no more but the least want of that which
the Law requires.

Q How many sorts of sin are there?

A. Sin is either Coloss. 3.9. psalm. 15.5.
the corruption of nature, or any evil actions that proceed of it as fruits
thereof.

Q. In whom is this corruption of nature?

A. In all men, Romans 3.10,
none excepted.

Q. In what part of man is it?

A. In every Gen 6.5. 1 Thessalonians. 5.23.
part both of body and soul, like as a Leprosy that runs from the crown
of the head, to the sole of the foot.

Q. Show me how every part of man is corrupted with sin?

A. First, in the 1. Cor. 2.14. romans 8.5.
mind there is nothing but ignorance and blindness concerning heavenly
matters. Secondly, Tit. 1.15. ephe. 4.18. esaias. 57.20.
the conscience is defiled, being always either benumbed with sin, or else
turmoyled with inward accusations and terrors. Thirdly, Phi. 2.13. job. 15.16.
the will of man only wills and lusts after evil. Fourthly, the Gal. 5.24.
affections of the heart, as love, joy, hope, desire, etc. are moved and
stirred to that which is evil to embrace it, and they are never stirred unto
that which is good, unless it be to eschew it. Lastly, the Romans 6.19.
members of the body are the instruments and tools of the mind for the
execution of sin.

Q. What be those evil actions that are the fruits of this corruption?

A. Evil Genesis 6.5.
thoughts in the mind^ which come either by a man's own conceiving, or by the
Ioh. 13.2. act. 5.3. 1. chro. 21.1.
suggestion of the Devil: evil motions and lusts sturring in the heart, and
from these arise evil words and deeds, when any occasion is given.

Q. How comes it to pass that al^ men are thus defiled with sin?

A By Rom^ 5.12.18, 19. genesis 3.
Adams infidelity and disobedience, in eating the forbidden fruite^ even as
we see great personages b^ treason do not only hurt themselves but also
stain their blood, and disgrac^ their posterity.

Q. What hurt comes to man by his sin?

A. Gal. 3.10.
He is continually subject to the curse of God in his life time, in the end of
his life, and after this life.

Q What is the curse of GOD in this life?

A. In Deuteronomy. 28.21, 22.27.65, 66, 67.
the body diseases, aches pains: in the soul, blindness, hardness of heart,
horror of conscience: in goods, hindrances and losses: in name, ignominy and
reproach: lastly, in the whole man, bondage under satan the Prince of
darkness.

Q. What manner of bondage is this?

A. This Heb. 2.14. ephe. 2.2. 2. cor. 4.4. luke 11, 21.
bondage is when a man is the slave of the Devil, and has him to reign in
his heart as his God.

Q. How may a man know whether satan be his God or not?

A. He may know it by this, if he give obedience to him in his heart, and
express it in his conversation.

Q. And how shall a man perceive this obedience?

A. If he Ioh. 8.44. 1. ioh. 3.8.
take delight in the evil motions that Satan puts into his heart, and do
fulfill the lusts of the Devil.

Q. What is the curse due to man in the end of his life?

A. Romans 5.12.
Death, which is the separation of body and soul.

Q. What is the curse after this life?

A. Gal. 3.10. romans 3.10.
Eternal damnation in hell fire, whereof every man is guilty, and is in as
great danger of it, as the Traitor apprehended is in danger of hanging,
drawing, and quartering.

III.
Q. If damnation be the reward of sin, then is a man of all creatures most
miserable. A Dog or a Toade when they die, all their misery is ended: but when
a man dies, there is the beginning of his woe.

A. It were so indeed, if there were no means of deliverance. but God has
showed his mercy in giving a Savior to mankind.

Q. How is this Savior called?

A. Matt. 1.21.
Jesus Christ.

Q. What is Jesus Christ?

A. The Heb. 2.16. ioh. 1.14.
eternal Son of God made man in all things, even Heb. 5.7. mar. 13.18.
in his infirmities like other men, save only in sin.

Q. How was he made man void of sin?

A. He was Matt. 1.18.
conceived in the womb of a Virgin, and sanctified by the holy Ghost, at his
conception.

Q. Why must our Savior be both God and man?

A. He 1. Tim. 2.5.6
must be a man: because man has sinned, and therefore a man must die for sin
to appease Gods wrath: he must be God to sustain and uphold the manhood, to
overcome and vanquish death.

Q. What be the offices of Christ to make him an all-sufficient Savior.

A. He Psalm. 45.7. luke 4.18. deuteronomy. 18.15.18. luke 1.33. psalm. 100. all
is a Priest, a Prophet, a King.

Q. Why is he a Priest?

A. To work the means of salvation in the behalf of mankind.

Q. How does he work the means of salvation?

A. Matthew 20.28 heb. 7.25, 26.
First, by making satisfaction to his Father for the sin of man: secondly, by
making intercession.

Q. How does he make satisfaction?

A. By two means: and the first is by offering a Sacrifice.

Q. What is this sacrifice?

A. Esaias. 53.10.
Christ himself, as he is man, consisting of body and soul.

Q. What is the Apoc. 8.3. heb. 13.10.
Altar?

A. Christ as he is God, is the Altar on which he sacrificed himself.

Q. Who was the Priest?

A. None but Heb. 5.5, 6.
Christ, and that as he is both God and man.

Q. How often did he sacrifice himself?

A. Never but Heb. 9.28.
once.

Q. What death did he suffer when he sacrificed himself?

A. A death upon the Cross, peculiar to him alone: for Esaias 53.5. ioh. 12.9.
revel. 19.15. luke 22.44.
besides the separation of body and soul, he felt also the panges of hell, in
that the whole wrath of God due to the sin of man, was powered forth upon him.

Q. What profit comes by this sacrifice?

A. Gods Heb. 9 26.
wrath is appeased for sin.

Q. Could the suffering of Christ, which was but for a short time, appease Gods
wrath?

A. Yea, for seeing Christ suffered Act. 20.28. 2. cor. 5 19.
GOD suffered: and that is more than if all men in the world had suffered for
ever.

Q. Now tell me the other means of satisfaction.

A. It is the perfect fulfilling of the Law.

Q. How did he fulfill the Law?

A. By 1. Cor. 1.30. romans 2.19. 2. Cor. 5.21.
his perfect righteousness: which consists of two parts, the first, the
integrity and pureness of his human nature; the other, Romans 5.18. romans 4.8.
his obedience in performing all that the law required.

Q. You have showed how Christ does make satisfaction, tell me likewise how
he does make intercession?

A. He alone does continually Romans 8.34. 1. pet. 2.5.
appear before his Father in Heaven, making the faithful and all their prayers
acceptable unto him, through the merits of his own perfect satisfaction.

Q. Why is Christ a Prophet?

A. To Ioh. 6.45. matthew. 3.17.
reveal unto his Church the way and means of salvation, and this he does
outwardly by the Ministry of his word, and inwardly by the teaching of his
holy Spirit.

Q. Why is he also a King?

A. That Esaias 9.7.
he might bountifully bestow upon us, and convey unto us all the foresaid
means of salvation.

Q. How does he show himself to be a King?

A. In Acts. 10.40. ephesians, 4.8. act. 1.9.
that, being dead and buried, he rose from the grave, quickened his dead body,
ascended into heaven, and now sits at the right hand of his Father, with
full power and glory in heaven.

Q. How else?

A. In Esa. 9.7. and 30.21.
that he does continually inspire and direct his servants by the divine power of
his holy spirit, according to his holy word.

Q But to whom will this blessed King communicate all means of salvation?

A. He Ioh. 1.11. 1. ioh. 2.2.
offers them to all mankind, and they are sufficient to save all mankind:
but all shall not be saved thereby, because by faith they will not receive
them.

IIII.
Q. What is Faith?

A. Faith, is a Ioh. 1.12. and 6.35. gal. 3.27. coloss. 2.12.
wonderful grace of God, by which a man does apprehend and apply Christ and
all his benefits unto himself.

Q How does a man apply Christ unto himself, seeing we are on earth, and
Christ in heaven?

A. This 1. Cor. 1.12. romans 8.16.
applying is done by assurance, when a man is verily persuaded by the holy
spirit, of Gods favor toward himself particularly, and of the forgiveness
of his own sins.

Q. How does God bring men truly to believe in Christ?

A. First he prepares their hearts, that they might be capable of faith: and
then he works faith in them.

Q How does God prepare men's hearts?

A. Ezech. 11.19 hos. 6.1, 2.
By brusing them, as if one would break an hard stone to powder: and this is
done by humbling them.

Q. How does God humble a man?

A. By working in him a sight of his sins, and a sorrow for them.

Q How is the sight of sin wrought?

A. By the Romans 3.20. and 7.7, 8.
Moral law: the sum whereof is the ten commandments.

Q. What sins may I find in my self by them?

A. Ten.

Q. What is the first?

A. Command. I.
To make some thing thy God which is not God, by fearing it, loving it, so
trusting in it more than in the true God.

Q What is the second?

A. II.
To worship false Gods or the true God in a false manner.

Q. What is the third.

A. III.
To dishonor God in abusing his titles words, and works.

Q. What is the fourth?

A. IIII.
To break the Sabbath in doing the works of their calling and of the flesh:
and in leaving undone the works of the spirit.

Q. What be the six latter?

A. To do any thing that may hinder thy neighbors V.
dignity, VI.
life, VII.
chastity, VIII.
wealth, IX.
good name; X.
though it be but in the secret thoughts and motions of thy heart, unto which
thou give no liking nor consent.

Q. What is sorrow for sin?

A. It is Act. 2.37, 38. cant. 5.4.
when a man's conscience is touched with a lively feeling of Gods displeasure
for any of these sins: in 1. Tim. 1.15 luke 15.21.
such wise, that he is wholly out of heart with himself, acknowledging that
he has deserved shame, and confusion eternally.

Q. How does God work this sorrow?

A. By the terrible curse of the law.

Q. What is that?

A. He Gal. 3.
which breaks but one of the commandments of God, though it be but once in
all his life time; and that only in one thought, is in danger of eternal
damnation thereby.

Q. When men's hearts are thus prepared, how does GOD ingraft faith in them?

A. By working certain inward motions in the heart, which are the seeds of
faith, out of which it breeds.

Q. What is the first of them?

A. When a man humbled under the burden of his sins, does Esaias 55.1. ioh.
7.37. luke 1.53.
acknowledge and feel that he stands in great need of Christ.

Q. What is the second?

A. An Revel. 21.6
hungring desire and a longing to be made partakers of Christ and all his
merits.

Q. What is the third?

A. Heb. 4.16,
A flying to the throne of grace, from the sentence of the law, pricking the
conscience.

Q. How is this done?

A. By Luke. 15.18, 19. mat. 15.22, 23. act. 8.22. 2. cor. 12.1.
praying, with sending up loud cries for Gods favor in Christ in the
pardoning of sin: and with fervent perseverance herein, till the desire of
the heart be granted.

Q. What follows after all this?

A. GOD then, Math. 7.7. esaias. 65.24.
according to his merciful promise, lets the poor sinner feel the assurance
of his love wherewith he loves him in Christ; which assurance is a lively
faith.

Q. Are there diverse degrees and measures of true faith?

A. Romans 1.17. luke 17.5.
Yea.

Q. What is the least measure of true faith that any man can have?

A. When a man of an humble spirit by reason of the Esaias. 42.^. matt. 17.20.
luke 17.5.
littlenes of his faith, does not yet feel the assurance of the forgiveness of
his sins, and yet he is persuaded that they are pardonable, and therefore
desires that they should be pardoned, and with his heart prays to God to
pardon them.

Q. How do you know that such a man has faith?

A. These Romans 8.23.24 gal. 4.6. matt. 5.6
desires and prayers are testimony of the spirit, whose property it is to
stir up a longing and a lusting after heavenly things, with sighs and
groans for Gods favor and mercy in Christ. Now Romans 8.9. ephe. 3.17.
where the spirit of Christ is, there is Christ dwelling: and where Christ
dwells, there is true faith how weak soever it be.

Q. What is the greatest measure of faith?

A. When a man is fully persuaded of GODS love in Christ toward himself
particularly, Romans 8.38, 39 cant. 8.6, 7
and of the forgiveness of his own sins.

Q. When shall a Christian heart come to this full assurance?

A. Not 2. Tim. 4.7, 8 psalm. 23.6. with 1, 2, 3, 4,
at the first, but in some continuance of time, when he has been well
practiced in repentance, and has had diverse experiences of Gods love unto him
in Christ: then after them will appear in his heart the fulness of persuasion:
which is the ripenes To. 4.20, 21.
and strength of faith.

Q. What benefits does a man receive by his faith in Christ?

A. Hereby 1. Cor. 1.39. act. 15 9 romans 4.3.
he is justified before God and sanctified.

Q. What is this to be justified before God?

A. It Rom 8.33.
compreheneth two things the first, to be cleared from the guiltiness and
punishment of sin: the second, to be accepted as perfectly righteous before
God.

Q. How is a man cleared from the guiltines and punishment of his sin.

A. By Christ's Collos. 1.22. 1. pet. 2.25. 1. ioh. 1.17
sufferings and death upon the Cross.

Q. How is he accepted righteous before God?

2 Cor. 5.21.
A. By the righteousness of Christ imputed to him.

Q. What profit comes by being thus justified?

A. Hereby Romans 4.17. apoc 21 27
and by no other means in the world, the believer shall be accepted before
Gods judgment seat, as worthy of eternal life by the merits of the same
righteousness of Christ.

Q. Do not good works then make us worthy of eternal life?

A. No: for GOD who is perfect righteousness it self, will find in the best
works we do, more matter of damnation than of salvation: and therefore Psalm.
143.2 esaias. 64.6
we must rather condemn our selves for our good works, than look to be
justified before God thereby.

Q. How may a man know, that he is justified before God?

A. He need not ascend into heaven to search the secret counsel of God: Romans
8.1 1. john. 3.9.
but rather descend into his own heart to search whether he be sanctified or not.

Q. What is it to be sanctified?

A. It comprehends two things: the first to be purged from the corruption of
his own nature: the second to be endued with inward righteousness.

Q. How is the corruption of sin purged?

A. By the Romans 6.4. 1. pet. 4.1, 2
merits and power of Christ's death, which being by faith applied, is as a
corasiue to abate, consume, and weaken the power of all sin.

Q. How is a man endued with inherent righteousness?

A. Through the Romans 6.5, 6 phillip. 3.10.
virtue of Christ's resurrection, which being applied by faith, is as a
restoratiue to revive a man that is dead in sin to newnes of life.

Q. In what part of man is sanctfication wrought?

A. In 1 Thessalonians. 5.23
every part of body and soul*

Q. In what time is it wrought?

A. It is Romans 8.23. 2. cor. 5.2, 2.
begun in this life, in which the faithful receive only the first fruits of
the spirit, and it is not finished before the end of this life.

of sin, and the love of righteousness.

there will arise a godly sorrow, which is, when a man is grieved for no other

who has bin unto him a most merciful and loving Father.

Q. What sign is there of this sorrow?

Q. What outward means mus^ we use to obtain faith and all blesssings of God
which come by faith.

A. The preaching Prou. 28.19. romans 10.14. mat. 28.19, 20.
of Gods word^ and the administration of the Sacraments, and prayer.

Q. Where is the word of God to be found?

A. The whole word of God needful to salvation is set down in the holy
Scriptures. 2. Tim. 3.16.


Q. How know you that the Scriptures are the word of GOD and no^ men's policies?

A. I am assured of it. First, Ephesians. 1.13.
because the holy Ghost persuades my conscience that it is so. Secondly, I see
it by experience: for the preaching of the Heb. 4.12. 1. cor. 14.25.
Scriptures have the power of GOD in them to humble a man when they are
preached, and to cast him down to hell: and afterward to restore and raise him
up again.

Q. What is the use of the word of God preached?

A. First it Romans 1.17. 2 cor. 2.16 hebr. 4.2.
breeds and then it increases faith in them which are chose^ to salvation:
but unto them that perish it is by reason of their corruption an occasion of
their further damnation.

Q. How must we hear Gods word, yt it may be effecuall to our salvation?

A. We Iam. 1.19 act. 16.14. hebr. 4.2 esaias. 66.2 luke 2.51. psalm 119 11.
must come unto it with hunger-bitten hearts, having an appetite to the word;
we must mark it with attention, receive it by faith, submit our selves unto it
with fear and trembling, even then when our faults are reproved: lastly, we
must hide it in the corners of our hearts, that we may frame our lives and
conuersations by it.

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. A Romans 4.11 genesis 17.12 gal. 3.1
sign to represent, a seal to confirm, an instrument to convey Christ and
all his benefits to them that do believe in him.

Q. Why must a Sacrament represent the mercies of God before our eyes?

A. Because we are dull to conceive and to remember them.

Q. Why does the Sacrament seal unto us the mercies of God?

A. Because we are full of unbelief and doubting of them.

Q. Why is the Sacrament the instument of the spirit to convey the mercies of
God into our hearts?

A. Because we are like Thomas, we will not believe till we feel them in some
measure in our hearts.

Q. How many Sacraments are there?

A. Two 1. Cor. 10.1, 2.3.
and no more. Baptism, by which we have our admission into the true Church of
God: and the Lords supper, by which we are nourished and preserved in the
Church after our admission.

Q. What is done in Baptism?

A. Act. 2.38 tit. 3 5. act. 22.16. matthew. 28.19
Solemnly in the assembly of the church a covenant is made between the Lord
and the party baptized.

Q. In ye making of this covenant what does God promise to ye party baptized?

A. Gal. 3.27. 1. pet. 3.21.
Christ with all blessings that come by him.

Q. To what condition is the party baptized, bound?

A. To Mark. 16.16.
receive Christ, and to repent of his sin.

Q. What means the sprinkling or dipping in water.

A. The covenant being solemnly made, is thereby sealed and confirmed.

Q. How comes it to pass that many after their baptism for a long time
feel not the effect and fruit of it, and some never?

A. The fault is not in GOD, who keeps his covenants; but the fault is in
themselves, in that they do not keep the condition of the covenant to receive
Christ by faith, and to repent of all their sins.

Q. When shall a man then see the effect of his Baptism?

A. At what Hebr. 10.20. 1. pet. 3.21.
time soever he does receive Christ by faith, though it be an hundred years
after, he shall then feel the power of GOD to regenerate him, and to work al
things in him, which he offered in Baptism.

Q. How if a man never keep the condition, to which he bound himself in
Baptism?

A. His damnation Deuteronomy. 23.21, 22. eccl. 3.4.
shall be the greater, because he breaks his vow made to God.

Q. What is done in the L. supper?

A. The former covenant made in Baptism, is renewed in ^. Cor. 11.23, 24, 25,
and 12, 13
the Lords supper, between the Lord himself and the receiver.

Q. What is the receiver?

A. Every one 1. Cor. 11.28.31. matthew. 5.22, 23. esaias 66.2, 3.
that has been baptized, and after his baptism has truly believed in Christ:
and repented of his sin from his heart.

Q. What means the bread and wine, the eating of the bread, and drinking of
the wine?

A. These outward actions 1. Cor. 10.16 17.
are a second seal, set by the Lords own hand unto his covenant. And they
do give every receiver to understand, that as God does bless the bread and
wine, to preserve and strengthen the body of the receiver: so christ received
by faith, shall nourish him, and preserve both body and soul unto eternal
life.

Q. What shall a true receiver feel in himself after the receiving of the
Sacrament?

A. 1. Cor. 10.16 17. and 11.24.
The increase of his faith in Christ, the increase of sanctification, a greater
measure of dying to sin, a greater care to live in newnes of life.

Q. What if a man after the receiving of the Sacrament, never find any such
thing in himself?

A. He may well suspect himself, whether he did ever repent or not.

Q. What is another means of increasing faith?

A. Prayer.

Q. What is prayer?

A. 1. John. 5.14.
A familiar speech with God: 1. Tim. 2.1. phil. 4.6.
in which either we crave things needful, or give thanks for things received.

Q. In asking things needful, what is required?

A. Two things, an earnest desire, and faith.

Q Why do the godly die?

A. That Luc. 23 43. act. 7.70. 1 Thessalonians. 4.3. heb 2.14. 1. cor. 15.5.
their bodies may rest for a while in the earth. and their souls may enter into
heaven immediately.

Q. What follows after death?

A. The day of judgment.

Q. What sign is there to know this day from other days?

A. 2. Pet 3.11, 12.

shall come in the clouds in great Majesty and glory with infinite company of

A. At the Matt. 24.3.
sound of a trumpet, the living shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye,
and the dead shall rise again every one with Job. 19.26.
his own body, and all shall be gathered together before Christ: and after
this, the good shall be severed from the bad, Matt. 25 32.33.
these standing on the left hand of Christ, the other on the right.

Q. How will Christ try and examine every man's cause?

A. The Reave. 20.12. dan. 7.10.
books of all men's doings shall be laid open, and every man shall be tried
by the works which he did in his life time, because they ar^ open and manifest
signs Ioh. 3.18. and 5.24.
of faith o^ unbelief.

shall continue for ever in the highest heaven in the presence of God having full
fellowship with Christ Jesus, and reigning with him for ever.

Q. What state shall the wicked be in after the day of Judgment?

A. In eternal perdition and destruction in hell fire.

Q. What is that?

A. It 2 Thessalonians. 1.8, 9. esaias. 66.24. apoc. 21.8.
stands in three things especially, 1. a perpetual separation from Gods
comfortable presence, 2. fellowship with the devil and his angels, 3. an
horrible pang and torment both of body and soul, arising of the feeling of
the whole wrath of God, powered forth on the wicked, for ever, world without
end.
