Imprinted at London by Christopher Barkar. ANNO. 1577.

John Casimire by the grace of God Count Palatine by the Rhein, Duke in Bauire
etc. and appointed Lieutenant General of the said Palatinate besides the
Rhein, sends greeting.
ALthough the high and mighty prince, and our entirely beloved Lord and
father, Friderich late Paltzgraue by the Rhein, and Elector of the holy
empire, of worthy memory, in the whole time of his government, and
especially in the year of our lord god 1566 at the time of the diet holden at
Augusta, where he was present about the confession of his christian faith: and
also in the Cathechisme and book of the reformation and orders of the churches
in his dominions heretofore published, has sufficiently declared and witnessed
to the whole world, that neither he him self held or maintained, nor in his
lands and dominions had suffered to be set forth and published, any other
kind of religion then that which was in all parts agreeable unto the doctrine
of the holy prophetical and apostolical scriptures, and besides conformable
with the confession of Augusta and apology thereof, as the same was allowed of
by the Princes and Estates assembled at Nawmburg: yet sith the time of the
departure of our said lord and father out of this vale of misery, we have
partly our selves with our own ears heard, and partly understood from other
places to our great grief, that it has been given out by some (although
untruely) that our said father before his death should have been removed from
his former confession, as though aforetimes he had proceeded to far in such
matters. And albeit we for our own part, since the time that by the grace of
God we were called out of Popery, have always taken and found his said
Confession to be no otherwise, then Christian, and grounded in the infallible
word of God, and especially at the time of the said diet of Augusta, where we
attended upon our said father, and by his commandment exhibited the books of
the holy Bible and Confession of Augusta before the Electours and other
Princes of the Empire then present, and the Commissioners and Ambassadors of
those which were absent. Out of which in our said fathers behalf we desired,
that an other and better confession might be showed and taught unto him: where
seeing none of them brought any thing at al against our said fathers
confession, we were at that time the more confirmed therein: And since
according to the same have not only with heart and mouth professed, but also
being accompanied with diverse noble men, and other virtuous and honest persons
fearing God, have at two several times sufficiently in the face of the whole
world witnessed our zeal therein. And yet in like sort (as we have been
informed) it has been imputed unto us, that if we were not wholly departed and
removed from our fathers said Confession yet at the lest we were become
somewhat less earnest then before.

For which cause seeing our said Lord and father in the absence of the noble
and mighty Prince, Ludouick Palzgraue by the Rhein, now Electour of the holy
Empire, our well-beloved Lord and brother, about the space of one month before
his departure called and sent for us in this place unto him, where we remained
with him still until his end, in which time we understood from himself that
not only the above mentioned Confession heretofore published was with his own
hands made, but also that he had caused the same to be written and inserted in
his last will and testament. And further are witnesses that we have both heard
and seen, that until his last breath he with good remembrance and great
constancy continued in the profession of the same, and so blessedly departed
in our Lord Christ Jesus. And where as afterward our said well-beloved brother
coming hither, and with common consent opening the said will and testament,
which in the mean time remained not only untouched by any person, but also
kept under the hands and seals of good and sufficient witnesses, and further
was in every leaf subscribed with our said fathers own hand: we not only
found therein contained his above mentioned Confession, but also that we his
children appointed executours of his said last will, upon pain of the avoiding
of Gods displeasure, anger and curse, and eternal and worldly punishment, by
virtue and power of Gods immutable precept of obedience due unto him, were
commanded and enjoined both to maintain our said fathers confession, and also
to do our endeavors for the planting and spreading of it further. For which
cause with a good conscience (as we trust) and also without any discredit or
prejudice to our fathers said will, and for diverse other weighty and
necessary causes, we could not any longer forbear for knowledge of the
truth, and answering of such reports as have been untruly bruted and spread
abroad to the contrary, openly to give herewith a true testimony of the said
matter, causing the said Confession as it was word for word written and
inserted in our fathers said testament, to be published and printed: To the
intent that the duetiful accomplishment and fulfilling of his said last and
dear will, which is not only committed to the charge of the Electour our said
lord and brother (although to him chiefly) but also to his subjects,
Counselors, officers, and especially to the university here, the Schole, and
ministers, and also to the whole posterity, and every man in particular (as is
expressly contained in the said testament) might be known unto them and they
thereby understand their duty what they have to do: and further every
person whatsoever, be thereby assuredly persuaded in his conscience, that our
said lord and father, in no other confession nor in any erroneous condemned
opinion, but in a most Christian confession and acknowledging of the infallible
and invincible truth of our common true and ancient Christian faith, departed
most godly out of this vale of misery into everlasting joy and quietness. By
which confession as grounded upon the right rock Christ Jesus our Lord and
Savior, and his most godly word, the right touchestone, we also through the
help and assistance of almighty God, mind to persevere and continue unto our
last end: and beseech the almighty that he will not only graciously preserve
us and all our fellow members in Christ Jesus, from all contrary errors and
deprauations, which by unquiet and contentious persons and members are moved in
matters of religion and brought into the Church, but also maintain and keep
in us his known verity, comfort and strengthen us in all troubles and
tentations, and of his goodness once in these latter days open the eyes and
hearts of all Christian people, that we may have a regard not unto traditions
of men or private affections, but only to his most godly word as the truest
and infalliblest line and direction of our consciences and faithes, and grant
unto us all grace, that brotherly, Christian and due charity may take place
and dwell among us.

These sentences and words following were distinctly spoken by the said prince
Electour, being of good understanding and memory, not long before his death,
after he had declared that he persisted constant in his said confession which
follows.
First the saying of S. Paul, 1. Timoth. 1.

This is a most true and assured saying, and worthy by all means to be
embraced, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
the chiefest.

The second saying to them which stood by.

I have lived long enough for you, I must also once live for my self.

The third.

The gracious Lord call me when it shall please him. I have a joyful and free
conscience in the Lord Jesus, whom I have served with all my heart, and render
thanks unto him that I have lived so long, that in the churches and schools
under my dominion and charge, the people have been directed and taught from
traditions of men to believe in him alone.

The fourth. 2. Timoth. 4.

I have fought a good fight I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
from henceforth is laid up for me the crown of righteousness.

Here follows the said christian confession.
In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity of God the Father, the Son,
and the holy Ghost
WE Friderich by ye grace of God Count Palatine by ye Rhein, one of the
Electours of ye holy Roman Empire, Duke in Bauaria etc. confess and make
known to all persons by these our letters. etc.

First whereas we have been before all things Christianlie taught and resolved
out of gods word, that both everlasting and perpetual, and also the worldly
and temporal prosperity, peace, quietness, concord, and good estate of all
gouernements, principalities, countries, and people, and as well of such persons
as are ordained heads and magistrates, as other inferior members and
subjects: have their beginning, increase, and enriching, and are most assuredly
maintained and preserved by this only means when they shall set before their
eyes and seek to advance god and his holy word, and according to the same,
direct all their affairs and causes in this life, as by a most true and
infallible line: which thing also the very heathen, although they had no true
understanding of god, yet by the light of nature ingraffed in them saw and
confessed after a sort: and from thence at the first these declarations and
making of last wills (which men commonly call testamentes) took their
beginnings: But especially among ye old fathers, patriarchs and other
religious persons, they seem to have been chiefliest made to this end, for
that they would leave after them unto their children, heirs and successors,
a certain token and witness, whereby not only their said successors might
assuredly understand what religion and faith their forefathers were of, which
they had received out of gods word by open testimonies, and wherein they had
lived holilye and vprightely, and were graciously maintained, defended, and
protected by almighty god, and in the end so died: but also yt their
successors might have more cause to be moved with like bonds and duty to
follow the christian footsteppes of their predecessoures, and to imitate their
examples, and according to the same, to rule and mainetaine the people and
countries committed to their charge, (if they did look for and desired to
enjoy such everlasting and worldelie blessings of almighty God, as had been
bestowed upon their fathers: which thing appears by the last words used by
some of the patriarchs and good King David him self where he speaks to his
son Solomon after this sort:

1. Reg. 2.
Be of good comfort and show thy self a man: And attend or take heed unto
the charge of the Lord thy God, that thou walk before him in his ways, and
keep his precepts, commandments, judgments, and testimonies, as it is
written in the law of Moses, that thou may prosper in all that thou do,
and whereunto soever thou turnest thy self, that the Lord may confirm his
word that he has spoken over me and said: If thy children shall take heed to
their ways, that they walk before me in truth, and with all their hearts,
and with all their souls, there shall not at any time a man be wanting from
my body to sit upon the throne of Israel.

So also in like sort as a christian prince, fearing and loving god, and having
in the making of our last wilmore regard in our heart to everlasting and
immortal things, then to worldly and temporal matters, which perish and follow
and depend of the former, we have thought good for ye honor of almighty god,
discharge and comfort of our conscience, and for an unfeigned declaration to
our loving and dear sons, heirs and successoures, and whole posterity, and
also of all our true and faithful subjects, and every other whatsoever, to
whom it may appertain: in this our fatherly disposition, testament and last
will, to make an open and true declaration of our faith, that every one may
have certain knowledge thereof, whereto we have been the rather induced for yt
in these latter days diverse and sundry errors and debates in matters of
religion have been moved by unquiet and contentious persons, wherewith both we
and others in the time of our government have been much troubled, and some
sects and factions have been raised in the church by certain persons going
about to persuade simple men, as though we were privy and consenting to their
erroneous opinions. And to the intent that it do not only appear that the
same our confession is only grounded and built upon the true rock Christ Jesus
our Lord and savior, and his only word: but also yt therewith our dear
children may be ye more comforted to persist steadfastly in such our christian
confession, and for no te^ptacio^ or troublesome storm whatsoever yt might
happen to ye contrary (whereof god be thanked hitherto by his almighty help and
assistance in ye time of our government we have both felt and overcome many)
turned back or made faynte hearted, fearful or negligent in their callings,
and setting forth of the said true and christian religion: Even as we for our
own person (as heretofore) so notwtstanding mind to continue by the said
known and confessed truth, through the grace of the most highest, until our
last end.

And so first and in general we confess with an unfeigned and assured heart,
that we steadfastly believe whatsoever is revealed, contained, taught,
witnessed, and grounded in the holy prophetical and apostolical scripture
and doctrine in the right, true, christian and uncorrupted understanding, and
meaning of the same: in such sort as the church in the time of the Apostles
did comprehend the principal points of christian doctrine in our christian
creed commonly called Symbolum apostolorum, and as afterward in the
confession of the counsel of Nice and Athanasius, the former apostolical
faith was truly expounded and declared.

This is the chief foundation, whereupon we and all other true believers in
Christ, which either have been before us, presently are, or shall come
hereafter, ought to build our faith. And through this we also hope to be saved
according to the saying of Athanasius in his Symbolo: whosoever will be saved,
must before al things hold the true christian faith.

And seeing the confession and declaration of the christian faith which in our
time and namely in the year of our lord god 1530. was openly presented at
Augusta to the Emperor Charles of that name the fifte, with the apology
thereto annexed, was gathered out of the said prophetical and apostolical
doctrine and above named creedes or confessions, as a summarie of them (as the
time then suffered) and thereupon grounded themselves as upon the chiefest and
vnfalliblest foundation, the only, certain, and steadfast line, whereby they
ought to be directed: For this cause we also sith the time that we came to
the knowledge of Gods truth, have received and allowed the same, and with other
Electors and Princes being addicted thereto, we also for the mainetenaunce of
Christian unity and peace, in the right and true understanding and meaning of
the same, and with this declaration, did set our hand and Seal thereto:

And according to this commanded the preachers and teachers to instruct in
our lands and dominions, as we yet also confess and acknowledge the same
both of the said confession, and of al other writings that are agreeing and
conformable with the godly, prophetical and apostolical scriptures:

As we especially take the cathechisme which we heretofore have caused to be
printed and published, and also the book of the reformation and orders of our
churches, wherein all the questions of christian doctrine are distinctlye,
orderlye and intelligiblye contained and also in some part more amplye
explaned.

But for the more declaration of our mind and meaning, and to the intent our
dear children, the whole posteritye and every particular person may (as it
were in a brief sum or collection) understand what we particularlye
believe and hold in all and every of the articles of the christian faith,
and no man after our death may defame us with any erroneous opinions and
sects, as it is the custom and propertye of many unquiet persons, in these
days of the evil world, and for the satisfying of them which understand and
interpret the said confession of Augusta and the Apologye thereof in some
points after another sense and meaning, then the letter and true understanding
can bear, following the direction of Gods word whereto it refers it self
as to the chiefest foundation: we believe, hold and confess from the bottom
of our heart, the articles of our old true and known Christian faith in manner
as follows.

I Believe in God the father almighty maker of heaven and earth: and in Jesus
Christ his only Son our lord: who was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of
the virgin Marye: suffered passion under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead,
buried, and descended into hell. He rose again the third day from death: he
ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the father
almighty. from thence he will come to judge the quick and the dead. I
believe in the holy Ghost: the holy church universal, the communion of
Saints, the forgiveness of sins: the rising again of the bodies: and life
everlasting.

That is:

We believe and confess, that the eternal father of our lord Jesus Christ made
heaven and earth and all that therein is of nothing, and also yet conserueth
and governs the same by his eternal wisdom and providence. And that not
for our own deserts or worthiness, but of mere grace and mercy and
according to his godly providence, for his only begotten and dear son
Christ Jesus sake: he also is our God and Father, upon whom we have so set
and reposed our confidence, that we dout not but that he will provide for us
all things necessary for our bodies and souls hereafter, eue^ as he has
done heretofore. And as hitherto he has turned to our best and profit, all
such evils as the devil and the world have attempted against us, even so
hereafter he will be no less gracious and merciful unto us, seeing he is able
to do it as an almighty God, and will also do it as a loving Father.

Secondlye we believe and confess, that Jesus Christ the son of the
almighty God, from the beginning begotten of the Father, is one and the same
GOD with the Father and the holy Ghost, and at the time appointed (as it was
determined in the eternal wisdom of God) was conceived by the holy Ghost,
in the womb of the most pure and always virgin Marye: took upon him our
flesh, was borne into the world, To this end, that he being our King and
high Priest (for which cause he is called Christ) might be our Mediator and
brother, receive us to grace, and as a true Jesus and Savior, reconcile us to
his heavenly Father. We also believe that for that cause he suffered a most
shameful death under Pontius Pilate the Judge, to the intent he might redeem
and deliver us from everlasting death wherein we otherwise were and must have
perpetually remained: and to deliver and loss us from the curse which by the
sin and fall of our first fathers Adam and Eve, was rooted in all mankind.

We believe also and confess yt this Lord Jesus Christ being made an
offering upon the cross is so puissant and strong, that by the power and
strength of the same through the working of the holy Ghost, our old man is
with him crucified, dead and buried, so as the evil concupiscenses of the
flesh ought not any more bear rule in us, but rather we should offer up our
selves unto him, as a sweet sacrifice of thanksgiving.

We believe also, that he was buried and therefore undoubtedly dead, yea also
that he descended into hell, to the intent that in our greatest tentations we
might assure our selves that our Lord Jesus Christ, by his unspeakable
sorrows, pangues and horrors which he also suffered in his soul both upon the
cross and before, has delivered us from ye sorrows and pain of hell. So that
from henceforth neither hell nor the devil shall hinder or hurt us in our
salvation. We believe also with our heart, that the third day he rose again from
the dead. And we are certainly persuaded, first that by his resurrection he
has overcome death, to the intent he might make us partakers of the
righteousness, which he has purchased for us by his bitter passion and death.
And secondly, that we also now by his power should be resuscitated and
quickened to newnes of life. And thirdly, that the resurrection of Christ is a
most certain assurance unto us, that as he is first risen up again from
death, so we also at the last day shall be raised up again to life everlasting.

And further, we also believe that Christ our Lord truly and visiblie with
his manifested manhood which he had taken on him, is ascended up into heaven,
and there sits on the right hand of his heavenly Father, that is to say,
with heavenly and godly majesty he shows him self unto all the holy Angels
and me^, to be a head of his whole Church: and from thence also truly and
visiblie (as he ascended up) he shall again come down in the clouds in the
dominion and majesty of his Father, to judge the living and the dead. And yet
notwithstanding we confess and acknowledge, that albeit our Lord JESUS Christ
true God and man, according to his humane nature is now no more in earth, but
in heaven, yet according to his Godhead, majesty, grace and spirit, he never
departs from us. And we little esteem that which is said by some, that both
the natures were so united and confounded in Christ, as though his humane
nature were in all places as the divine is. For seeing the divine nature is
incomprehensible, and always to be found in all places, it follows
necessarily, that it is both without ye humane nature, which was assumed, and
also personally united to the same: even as the divine nature never left
heaven when Christ was conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin. And all
this which our Lord Christ has suffered and done, we believe and confess that
it has been done for the behoof and benefit of us, and that he thereby has
given him self unto us as our own. And besides the rest, this comfort us
most that we are assured that our flesh is already in heaven, and that our
Savior Christ Jesus sends down unto us from thence his holy ghost as a
pledge. By the inspiration and power of whom, we seek ye things which are
above where Christ sits on the right hand of God his Father, and not things
here upon earth.

Thirdly, we believe and confess, that ye holy Ghost with God the Father and
God the son, is a true, only, and eternal God: and secondly, that he is
given unto us to make us partakers through a true faith in Christ, of al his
good gifts and benefits, and further that he is our comforter, and is with
us, and will remain with us until the end.

As touching the universal Christian Church, we believe that the son of God
has out of all kinreds and generations of men, chosen a congregation unto him
self for everlasting life, by the holy Ghost, and his godly word in the
unity of true faith: which from the beginning of ye world he has gathered,
and yet gathers together, preserves and defe^deth, and believe also yt we are
a lively member thereof and so shall remain eternally.

Of the communion of Saints we believe and confess that we with all and every
true beleuers, as members of our Lord Jesus Christ, have a communion and
society in all his treasures and gifts, and therefore we acknowledge that we
are debtors of all such gifts, as he has imparted unto us, to bestow the^
willingly and joyfully to the profit and help of others our commembers.

We believe and confess also, that God the Father for the satisfaction and
full payment of Christ Jesus has forgiven, and never will call to remembrance
our sins or sinful inclinations and affections, wherewith we have to fight
all the days of our life, but rather will give and impute unto us ye
righteousness of Christ Jesus. So that we need not to be afraid of the
judgment of God.

Of the resurrection of the flesh we believe and confess, that not only our
souls, when they shall be departed out of our bodies by temporal death, are
in the same instant taken up and received unto Christ their head, but also that
our flesh shall be in the last day united again with our souls, and made
conformable unto the glorious body of Christ Jesus.

Of life everlasting, we believe and confess, that even as now we feel in our
hearts the beginning of an everlasting joy, so after this life we shall
possess an eternal blessedness, which neither eye has seen, nor ear heard,
nor any ma^s heart can conceive. God be always thanked and praised therefore,
and thereto help us God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, one true and
everlasting God. Amen.

And for as much as without cause we have been suspected of many, as though we
held and believed not in such sort of the holy and blessed Sacraments, as
became good Christians, we have thought good immediately after ye former
Confession of our faith to set down also in writing our plain Confession of
those points.

We therefore believe and confess both with our mouth, heart and pen, that
all Sacraments as well of the old as new Testament, were appointed and
ordained by God him self, to this end, that they all should signify and
point as with a finger unto the bloody offering of Christ Jesus once
accomplished upon the cross, as undoubtedly all the patriarchs and faithful
fathers in the old Testament herewith only comforted them selves in faith,
when they killed their lambs and other beasts, that after the same sort the
seed of the woman, the Lord Jesus should be slain, and make a full
satisfaction and payment for the sins of the whole world. And therefore the
holy Sacraments (as many hundred years hitherto in the schools has been
taught to youth and yet is) are only Sacrae rei symbola, and inuisibilis
gratiae visibilia signa: that is to say, visible signs or seals of a holy
thing, namely of the grace of God in Christ Jesus, whereby we are assured and
made certain of that which otherwise in Gods word by God him self and his
holy Prophets and Apostles has been promised unto us. And we believe and hold
steadfastly, that the Lord God thought chieftiest upon the weakness and
infirmity of man's nature, and (as the only knower and searcher of hearts)
understood how hard it was for the nature of man to believe the naked word of
God which is preached and declared in the holy Gospel. And therefore he would
also represent and set before our eyes such things which we daily use, and are
most known unto us, to quicken, stir up, and strengthen our faith, to the
intent that thereby we might give the sooner credit to the word preached. As
the same may appear by this similitude taken from worldly things, namely when
we receive from an Emperor, King, or other great Prince, a letter or writing,
although the same be subscribed with the Princes own hand, yet we are not
satisfied therewith, if the seal be not annexed also to it. And in case the
Seal be put thereto, then it contenteth us, and then we may say, I have from
that Emperor, King, etc. a letter and seal, wherein this or yt is written and
signified unto me.

But to speak of the use of the Sacraments, we believe and confess that the
holy Sacraments of the new Testament, as the holy Baptism and Supper of the
Lord, were ordained of Christ himself, to that end that Christians should
use them, hold the^ in great reverence, and not despise them. For that they
are not only marks whereby we are known to be Christians, and of the open
profession before God and man of the covenant and grace of God, but also
especially and principally are true and assured tokens and witnesses of gods
grace toward us: For which cause when we shall have yo^g children borne into
this world, we should not as some do suffer the^ to be 8. 9. or 10. years
old, till they be of some reasonable discretion, and then first baptize them:
But rather much more comfort our selves with that which our Lord Christ said to
his disciples Mark. 10. Let little children come unto me: for of such is the
kingdom of heaven. If then the kingdom of heaven belong unto young children
(as it is undoubtedly true) why should we then doubt that they are not also
comprehended and concluded in the covenant which God made with Abraham and the
believing fathers heretofore? And for that cause we ought not by any means
seclude or forclose them from the holy baptism.

Of the efficacy and working of the holy Baptism, we believe, that our
children, seeing (as is before declared) they be comprehended in the covenant,
when they shall be baptized according to the article of our true, old and
universal faith, and also be afterward brought up in the same, they are also
made partakers of the bloody death of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, and
all his benefits which he has purchased unto us by his said death, in such
sort that they not only receive the outward seal of the holy Sacrament,
which is the eleme^tall water upon their outward bodies, but like wise
inwardly are baptized in their souls by Christ him self with his blood
which was shed, and also through the working of the holy Ghost regenerated and
borne again to be new creatures. For as the elementall water of the holy
Sacrament in baptism is not Christ's blood, nor the holy Ghost it self, so
also the holy Ghost or blood of Christ is not in the Sacrament of the
elemental water. And although the eleme^tall water according to his property
and nature can do no more then outwardly cleanse the body, and reaches not so
far as unto the soul, yet the blood of Christ cleanses the soul inwardly to
everlasting life. And as the minister does the one, so does Christ the other,
as saint John the Baptist witnesses in the third chapter of saint Matthewes
Gospel: I baptize you with water to repentance or amendment of life, but he
that comes after me is stronger then I am, whose shoes I am not worthy to
carry, he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost and with fire. And like unto
this is the saying of Saint Paul in the tenth Chapter of his first epistle to
the Corinthians, that after the same sort the Israelites were baptized with the
clouds and sea, as also they were fed with Manna, and drunk the water which
proceaded out of ye rock. etc.

And to speak of the holy and most worthy Supper of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
believe and confess willingly, with al other Christians, that our Lord Jesus
Christ first instituted ye said Supper, which he him self kept with his
disciples. And therefore it ought not to be despised of Christians but rather
to be holde^ in great estimation and reverence. For the Lord Jesus for this
cause ordained this participation and fruition of bread and wine, 1. Cor. 11.
that thereby we should remember him and declare his death until his coming:
and after we have been instructed and assured thereof, both before God and
man, acknowledge and praise this his great benefit, that the body of Christ
has been delivered up to death for us, and his blood shed for ye forgiveness of
our sins: which if we shall apprehende and take unto us with true faith, it
will be a true and spiritual food and drink to eternal life, as the visible
bread and wine is food for the nourishing of the corporal body: seeing we are
in Christ members of him the head, branches of him the vine tree, incorporated
into him by his spirit, and so for his sake and through him shall obtain
forgiveness of our sins, justification and life everlasting. We believe also
that we at this day have no other Supper or Communion then as our Lord Jesus
Christ at his last supper ordained and held it with his disciples, and that
we ought not to have any other, and much less use any other, unless we would
contemptuously offend against the commandment and institution of Christ.

Now it can not be denied but must be confessed of all (that obstinately and
maliciously seek not to contend) that our Lord Jesus Christ did not deliver
unto his disciples his natural and then present body as it was sitting at the
table, and not yet crucified, to be eaten with their corporal mouths, and
much less gave or commanded his blood to be drunke^, which was yet in his
body, and not shed (as at these days some have caused a great division in the
Church of God teaching that men must believe, that they must eat and drink in
the communion the body and blood of Christ with their corporal mouths, as it
was then natural and present at his last supper: and whosoever will not
believe and confess this, which without great prejudice of their consciences
they can not believe, they are called despisers of the Sacraments and great
blasphemers of god) But rather he commanded us to eat his body which was the
day following nailed to the cross, and drink his blood which should be
shortly shed, even as the very words of Christ him self sufficientlye give
us to understand. And we doubt not but that his disciples before at
Capernaum were sufficiently instructed and persuaded what was the meaning and
manner of the eating of his body and drinking of his blood, so that they had
not any occasion or cause to make the least dout therein: As also Peter
himself notably confesses, Ioh. 6.
saying: Lord whither should we go, thou have the words of everlasting life,
and we have believed and confessed that thou art Christ the son of the living
god.

Out of which confession of Peter which he made not alone for him self, but in
the name of all the twelve Apostles, it appears that he had understood and
received such sufficient instruction out of this sermon at Capernaum, that
neither he nor the other eleven had any cause to ask what the lord Jesus meant
by such his said institution.

And therefore we believe and confess that in the holy supper of our Lord
JESUS CHRIST, where it shall be kept according to his own institution, to the
faithful (for whom this Supper or Communion is only ordained, even as for
his disciples at the first) the true offered and crucified body of Christ
with all his heavenly treasures and benefits which he has purchased by his
death for his people, shall be given and delivered by Christ him self unto our
hungry souls for food, and his blood which he has shed for the forgiveness
of sins for our drink. And so little did the distance or espace of the time
hinder his disciples at that present, namely, that although his body was not
yet offered and crucified, nor his blood yet shed, yet his said disciples did
eat his very natural and humane body which was borne of the immaculate
virgin Marie, and should be shortly after delivered up for them, and did
drink his true blood which shortly should be shed for them, as though it had
been delivered up and shed already: So also the distance of the place hinders
not us and other faithful believers, that is, that we also with the holy
apostles according to the Lords institution do eat the same body of Christ
and drink his blood, although the Lord Jesus with that his natural body be
now no more upon earth, but sits in heaven on the right hand of god his
heavenly father, from whence he shall come to judge the living and the dead, as
the article of our Christian faith teaches and declares unto us. And
therefore we have no need of this question, whether with his self same natural
body sensible upon earth, (as he was at the last supper with his disciples)
he can be present with us in our communions: But it is enough that we
understand out of his word, that he with his said body will be neither visible
nor invisible neither comprehensible nor incomprehe^sible upon earth. And
nevertheless he is as the almighty son of God at all times and in all places
with his grace, and holy spirit with his, and chieflye in his holy supper
where he is both our host and food. And as the minister does distribute the
precious Sacraments, seals, and tokens, that is the blessed bread and cup
of the Lord, so does the Lord therewith impart unto the faithful him self
for bread and drink, (not of the worldly body, as the signs of wine and
bread are otherwise true meat and drink unto men) but rather a meat and
drink unto everlasting life for their hungry and thirstye souls, beaten
down and dismayed by the knoweledge and consideration of their sins, and of
the wrath of God.

Now therefore if this question be made, how Christ the Lord seeing he is with
his body above in heaven, and we here upon earth, can feed us with his
said body: we answer with S. Ambrose that albeit we be here with our feet
upon earth, yet are we with our head above in heaven. And with S. Paul, 1.
Cor. 12.
We are al baptized by one spirit into one body, and we are all made to
drink one spirit. And in this our confession we refer and remitte our
selves to the holy and godly Scriptures of the old and new Testaments and
confess herewith frankelye and freelye before the sight of Almyghtye God,
whom no man can abuse or deceive, that we undoubtedly think, that if we did
believe or hold otherwise of the said holy Sacraments, we then should as
much as in us lay, overthrow the articles of our old, true and christian
faith, and so should not be able to stand before the judgment seat of Christ
Jesus in the last day. For when as in the articles of our undoubted christian
faith we confess that there is but one only everlasting, almighty and
inco^prehensible godhead in three persons, which both made, governs and
co^serueth all things: then must it needs be (not as some have given out)
that the humane nature of our lord Jesus, but the man Christ by his godly
nature, is almighty and in all places working and present at once. Also the
only begotten son of god through ye working of the holy Ghost took upon
him and retains for ever to the great comfort and assurance of our
salvation, a true and unfeigned humane nature like unto ours in all properties
of nature (sin only excepted.) And so undoubtedly after and before his
resurrection, assension, and glory at the right hand of his father, according
to his said humane nature is and was visible, comprehensible, and at all times
in one place present, according to his good will and pleasure, as he witnesses
of himself in the 24 Chapter of the Gospel after S. Luke: This Lord Jesus
Christ is our only Savior, mediator, hie Priest, King, and Prophet, Lord
and head of his congregation. And therefore the ministers of ye church cannot
baptize us with the spirit and blood of christ, but only with the outward
elemental water, nor feed and drink us with the body and blood of Christ,
but with the visible bread and wine. And of his spirit body and blood, Christ
him self only makes us partakers by faith to the forgiveness of our sins and
life everlasting.

If he truly suffered for us, if he in very deed were crucified and dead, then
in the time of his passion, his manhood was not in omnipotency and glory like
unto his godhead in all places, in heaven and earth, but suffered and died, not
without infirmite: If also his dead corpse was truly laid into the grave, the^
was it not before there nor after his burial was it in all places but there for
ye time only.

If it be true that for our benefit he descended into hell, then was he not
at that time, as yet set at the right hand of GOD his Father in his heavenly
glory and majesty.

If it be true that out of the grave he rose up from death, then was the
soul before not in the body, and so the said body was not before out of the
grave, and also afterward remained not therein.

If it be true that he ascended up into heaven and sits there as perfect
man on the right hand of his Father, then according to his humanity he was not
already above before, and also after his ascension he remained not invisible
below, or in all places present, and incomprehensible: but shows himself
there visibly and comprehensibly in the heavenly habitation before the faces
and sight of his holy angels and men. And therefore he cannot be without
horrible idolatry said, to be in the bread of the communion, or in any one
place else, the^ at this present sought by our prayers above in heaven, and
honored and inuocated as only present and bodily there.

If it be true that as he ascended up, he shall come down again from heaven in
the clouds, then is he not already and before invisible below. And he shall
not be in all places visible and invisible, but visible in one place, with his
humane nature, that is, in the clouds where he shall show him self as a judge
of the living and of the dead.

He sends also his holy Spirit into the hearts of his elect to assemble and
gather together unto him amongst the generations of men, from the beginning of
the world unto the end, an universal church or congregation, which has the
very same and like fellowshippe with their head Christ, to whom he
participateth all his heavenly benefits: And this fellowshippe or communion of
ye saints is not wrought by a visible or invisible entrance of the body of
Christ into our bodies, but by the dwelling and working of the spirit of Christ
in them and in us. We also which come unto the Supper of the Lord, shall not
nor can not have any other participation or habitation of CHRIST in us, then
such as all the faithful had, which from the beginning of the world have been
saved, or such as they which cannot come unto the communion, now have and shall
retain euerlastinglye. Yea Christ in his holy supper will impart and give unto
us ye fruition of himself no otherwise the^ so far and in such sort, that he
according to the use of the said supper not only in this life, but in the life
to come, will euerlastinglye dwell and remain with us. And seeing it is
assured and certain, that he gives the fruition of him self unto us, it is
not to be thought that he will again inco^tinently depart from us, as to the
great dishonor of the Son of God has been forged by the papists, but will
remain in and with us everlastingly.

If he has purchased unto us the forgiveness of all our sins, through his
bitter passion and death upon the cross, in case we shall receive, take, apply
and make the same proper unto us by true faith as ye full satisfaction and
ranso^ for our sins, then had he not a nature deified present in every place,
but a very true humane, visible, and co^prehe^sible body, and also at ye time
subject to death, which was (sin excepted) in all things like unto ours. for
otherwise we could not be saved fromour sins by him. Hebrews. 2.

If our flesh shall rise again from death, and be made partaking of
everlasting life through Christ then must our head Christ Jesus have been
conversant here in his true humane nature, and not alone in his godly,
spiritual and invisible nature, present in every place: but retain for ever
the liknes and unity of his humane nature, which it had and has with our
nature, so that we may for ever be his brethren and members of him, planted
and graffed in him, as the branches in the vine tree, and so be and remain
always his flesh and his bones.

And lastly if the communion of CHRIST and of all his gifts and benefits
righteousness and life everlasting, was not otherwise purchased unto us, then
by his death upon the cross, and otherwise cannot be obtained of us, but
through true faith, which the holy ghost works in our hearts, then it is
certain that neither the use of ye holy Sacraments, nor yet any other inward
or outward work ex opere operato, yt is, by virtue of a work done: can make
us partakers of Christ or his benefits. But the holy Sacraments are godly
tokens and seals, by which our faith is strengthened: and they do direct
and lead us to the only offering of Christ which has been once made upon
the cross for us. And there cannot come unto us any such communion and
fellowshippe with Christ when we only hear outwardely the visible word or
promise of the Sacraments, as when inwardly we believe ye word of the Gospel,
which shall be heard and preached unto us. And therefore although the visible
signs may be abused by the ungodly and wicked to their comdemnation, yet the
invisible and heavenly gifts and benefits which we apprehe^d only by our
faith, must only be and remain proper to the faithful.

And in this confession and profession of our Christian and true faith, both
now and at al times, we bequeath our soul when it shall be separated from our
mortal body, to the holy and undivided Trinity, God ye Father our maker, God
the son our redeemer, mediator, and only Savior, Christ Jesus, God ye holy
Ghost our true comfort: humbly beseching from the bottom of our heart our
only redeemer and savior Christ Jesus, yt he would vouchsafe to hold his
gracious, merciful and saving hand over us, increase our faith and grant unto
us a Christian and good end in perfect sense and memory: and when we shall be
separated from this earthly body and woeful vale of misery, that it would
please him to carry and receive us up into everlasting rest, peace, and
blessedness, in his fathers kingdom, which he has promised, purchased and
prepared for us and all the faithful, by his bitter death and shedding of his
most precious blood to remain there in the company of his Saints and all
true believers in Christ Jesus.

And as we think to be saved by this our former Christian confession, and to
appear with a joyful countenance before the judgment seat of Christ Jesus:
So we admonish, warn and pray our dear children, heirs and successors in
most friendly sort, as a true father, and also graciously require such our
subjects as by Gods ordinance have been committed unto us, our cou^sellours,
officers, and especially our University, school and ministers, of what
dignity, state or degree soever they be and their successors: we also
ordain, co^ma^de, and enjoin unto the^ and every of the^, by virtue of the
immutable commandment of ye almighty God of Abraham, who said, I know he will
give charge unto his children and his house after him, that they may keep the
ways of the Lord, and do that which is good and right in his sight, to the
intent the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he promised unto him. And
therefore we will and command with the greatest earnestnes, charge, and zeal
that we can, that they not only for their own persons persist constant unto
their end by this acknowleged, confessed and blessed truth of the holy Gospel,
and former Christian confession, whereby the horrible darkness of Popery in our
days through the unspeakable goodness and mercy of almighty God has been
confounded and thrown down: And besides joyfully and frankely confess the
same before God and the world, and never abalienate or withdraw them selves
from the same, to the intent that with us (as we heartily desire) they may be
partakers of everlasting salvation: But chiefly and principally we desire
them, as Christian and godly Princes and magistrates, to whom ye defense and
propagatio^ of Gods known verity, is by almighty God him self very
earnestly imposed and commanded as their chiefest and highest office, that they
would with all diligence have a due regard, that the holy and blessed Gospel
and ye only truth of God (which is infallible and shall not pass away but
remain for ever) may be preached and taught unto all their subjects and
others appertaining unto them, according to the contents of the Prophetical
and Apostolical scriptures, purely and vnfalsified: that through the blessing
of almighty God the same may be still planted, inherited and professed by their
successors and posterity, to the intent they may be partakers of the rich and
gracious promise of our Lord and Savior JESUS Christ, saying, Seek first ye
kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof and the rest shall fall or be given
unto you: truly and assuredly confirming and strengthening them selves with
the commandment and comfort of almighty God, which he gave to his loving and
true servant Joshua in these words: Be strong and of a most valiant courage,
that thou may observe and do all things according to ye law, which Moses my
servant has commanded thee. Turn not from it neither to the right hand, nor
to the left, that thou may prosper and proceade wisely in all that thou have
to do. And let ye book of the Law never depart from thy mouth, but meditate
upon it day and night, that thou may do and observe al things according as
it is written therein.

Secondly, for as much as both now and always it has so come to pass, that
when Gods word and holy Sacraments have been in any place taught and
administered purelie, clearly and without darkness or falsehoode, and almighty
God by his blessed word has gathered unto him a Church, that then
immediately and forthwith ye enemy of Christian faith, ye raging devil,
partly sows his weeds among it, and partly opposes him self and assaulteth
it with his whole forces and might and goes about by all means he can not only
to overthrow and quench it with his outward power, but also by stirring up of
diverse divisions, co^tentions, false and erroneous opinions, which also in ye
time of our government (as is well known unto all men) not without some danger
have also happened unto us, and especially in ye some unquiet and contentious
persons of mere ambition and settled hatred, whereas they could not publish a
better book of their own, went about and very earnestly labored to slander
and cavil the Cathechisme and book of the orders and reformation of our
Church, which we caused to be published, and to bring the same into suspicion
by sondrie simple and well meaning people. All which notwithstanding by the
help and grace of almighty God, whilst we suffered our selves not to be
carried away from the right line of Gods word, nor to be made afraid by any
respect of outward power, but truly and constantly follewed our office and
calling, in the end wonderfully contrary to all men's expectation, with great
and apparent benefit both worldly and eternal, and many other blessings and
commodities which happened to our people, which did at length submit them
selves obediently unto the manifest truth, we outstoode and overcame them all:
and out of Gods word have stopped the mouths of such as so opposed and set
them selves against our said Christian Cathechisme and book of orders, so as
to our great comfort, the eyes of many have been thereby opened, and brought to
the right understanding of our true Christian religion and confession of pure
doctrine.

We therefore pray, admonish and warn our dear children, also our
Counselors, officers, ministers and subjects, and especially our University
and Church at Heydelberg, that seeing the malice, deceit and subtlety of the
devil, and so the dangers of true faithful Christians, are like every day
more and more to increase and wax greater: They would in consideration of such
imminent perils have a more true, diligent and earnest regard thereto, not
only to set forward this good work, as they mind to avoid the heavy anger
and displeasure of almighty GOD, and his everlasting and worldly punishment
upon them, and tender the salvation of them selves and their posterity, but
also not suffer them selves to be feared, turned away or seduced from this
known and confessed trothe, for any contentions already entered into the
Church, fear of offending, respects of persons, deceiptes and other
subtilties of this vain world, but rather open their eyes, awake, take heed,
and do their best endeavors, that in such places of our dominions as gods
trothe has already been taught and received, may there still and constantly
be retained, kept, and increased. And in case the same hitherto through any
empechementes of the wicked devil, and other defaultes, shall not have been
perfectly in all places established, known and rooted in our said subjects,
that then in such place or places by ye grace and means of almighty God and
Christ Jesus, they would procure yt the same may be brought in, taught and
planted, to the everlasting and temporal profit and benefit of our said
subjects.

Especially and for the third point, we will and pray our dear sons, to
beware and take heed of all contentious and unquiet ministers in churches and
schools, which in these times go about to stir up in matters of faith and
religion, sondrie evil co^tentions, and strifes about words, using
unprofitable conde^nations and censures against other Christian Churches and
Schools, which nevertheless agree in the principal foundation and chief
articles of the Christian faith, and repose the salvation of their souls upon
the only Savior and redeemer Christ Jesus: going about by ambition and
perverse zeal, to bring in and erect a pretended jurisdiction of a holy Ghost,
and eue^ as in time of blasphemous Popery, seeking both to rule and have
dominion over the consciences of magistrates and subjects, and to constitute a
new supremacy: whereby not only divisions and bitterness of minds both in
temporal and spiritual gouernementes have followed, to the overthrow and
ruin of them: But also thereby occasion has been given to the Pope and his
followers, to persecute our true and Christian religion with fire and sword,
banishmentes and other pains and punishments: and thereby to establish and
confirm his own tyranny the more. As (the more is the pity) many examples
partly already heretofore happened even in our days in some Electours and
Princes houses, and among other strange nations our neighbors, where the
holy Gospel a long time has had a swaye, and partly of late time sprung up,
might be produced to declare sufficiently, what miserable diuisio^s, calamities
and misfortunes have happened thereby, where unto also al Christian
magistrates, Churches and schools, ought to behold and look unto as in a
glass. And therefore we would have them as much as in them shall lie, to
beware of such dangerous and unquiet persons, enemies of peace and quietness,
and neither suffer them selves or any other under them to be persuaded or
exasperated by their means or divided among them selves: But rather to eschew
and avoid them, and also whereas no amendeme^t can be looked for, to suppress
them: to the intent that they be not partakers of the detestable and horrible
persecutions and shedding of innocent blood, which both in the Empire of
Dutchland and other outlandishe nations have followed by such unchristian
condemnation and censures: Even as we for the most part have in like manner for
the above rehearsed and other Christian and weighty causes, agreed, consented
and united our selves with other Electours and Princes. And hereby
notwithstanding it is not meant to take from true and godly ministers such
punishments and censures as appertain unto them for the reforming of
blasphemies, and confuting of errors that may happen, according to the word of
GOD, with Christian decency, which is to be established and used not to the
overthrowing, but for ye edifying of ye Church of Christ Jesus. etc.

THE ANSWER OF the most famous and excellent Prince William Lantgraue of
Hessen, sent to the French King, by the Lord of Villequier Ambassador from
his Majesty to his excellency.
THE most famous and noble Prince, William Lantgraue of Hessen, having received
ye message sent him from the French King by the Lord of Villequier his Highness
Ambassador, renders his Majesty most hearty thanks for the good will it
pleases him to continue toward him: promising that for his part, his Highness
shall always find his excellency forward and ready, to answer him with the
like: as his Majesty may clearly see and understand by all his former actions
tending to no other mark, but to the maintenance of that good amity and
intelligence which has of long time been between the crown of France and the
house of Hesse.

As for the chiefest matter which the said Sir of Villequier had to communicate
with the said Prince the Lantgraue, in ye King his masters name, to wit, that
the King had, at the suit and request of the states assembled in his town of
Bloys, granted them, yt he would from thence forward, suffer no exercise of
any other religion in his Realm, save of the Catholic, Apostolic and
Romish, his excellency is of opinion and thinks yt in truth there is
nothing more greatly to be desired in this world, then that it would please
our good God of his infinite bou^tie and mercy, that the same true Religion,
which was once published and taught at Rome by the Apostle Paul, might through
his merciful sufferance, be not only planted, take root, and be maintained
in the kingdom of France, but also, as purely kept and preserved in all parts
of the world, as it was in ye beginning taught and planted in Rome, as we find
the said Apostle Paul has left witnessed in his epistle written to the
Romans.

But it is a matter very well known both to the King himself and to many
other good men, eue^ that are professors of the self same Romish religion,
that (after the Apostles time, when the authority of the Bishop of Rome became
so swollen and puffed up, that it would needs be a topgallant above Emperors,
Kings, and all other Monarchs of the world) that Religion which the Apostle
had planted at Rome, and wherefore he so highly commended their faith, became
through many abuses, men's tradicions, errors and Idolatries, altogether
defaced and falsified. A matter greatly complained of, by many good me^ both
of hie calling and others, not only at this day, but long since, and many
years ago, desiring no thing so much as to see ye church of Christ well
reformed. But it prevailed not as we may apparently see by all histories. Which
thing caused our Auncestoures and predecessoures of most worthy memory, and
other good men in other countries, for the quieting of their consciences, and
because GOD did so expressly command them to fly from Idolatry, to withdraw
themselves from the obedience of the Pope of Rome, and of themselves to make a
reformation according to ye writings of the holy Apostles and Prophets, because
they had no other means whereby to obtain it, and being persuaded as the
truth is, that it is better to obey God then man.

And it is well known that after these long and manifold troubles, wherewith the
kingdom of France has been pitifully wasted and brought to a very low ebb,
there could be no better way possibly devised upon, to appease former troubles
and to make an end of those grievous calamities which have through so long
continuance brought the whole kingdom to great extremity, and almost apparent
ruin, then to suffer them which have wtdrawen themselves from the obedience of
the Pope for the reasons before mentioned, to live with freedom of their
consciences under the free exercise of the reformed Religion, according to that
confession which they presented to ye King his brother that dead is.
Accordingly as was in fine accorded, agreed, granted and by oath promised, by
his Majesty, and his Counsel, by the Queen his mother, the Princes of his
blood, and officers of his crown, and other noblemen and gentlemen of his
privy counsel, by a perpetual and irreuocable Edict, promising that he would
mainetayne and keep thoroughly and in all points the peace last made and
published in all parts of his Realm, In witness whereof, and of his good intent
and meaning therein, he also sent the same to ye said Princes excellency, and
to many other Princes and noblemen of the Empire, by letters and Ambassages
using these terms following, That he would keep this edicte of pacification
inuiolably for ever, as the first earnest penny and pledge of his word given to
his subjects, which, he said, he had a care to keep truly and faithfully.

But his excellency seeing his majesty presently so sodeinly changed, clean
contrary to al yt he had promised before, and to suffer him self to be so
easily carried away with a few of the states assembled at Bloys, whose bills
were not answerable to the charge that was committed unto them, but as men
easy to be wo^ne suffered themselves to be framed to the fantasy of the
adverse party, contrary to all right and reason, as they of the reformed
religion do complain and lay forth their griefs against them, to revoke yt
which he had before so advisedly, and upon so good ground and counsel
sole^nely protested, to wit, that he would suffer ye free exercise of the
reformed religion for ever, Whereby his majesty has renewed ye former troubles
and disorders of his realm, which were hardly and with great difficulty
quenched and appeased, could not but be grieved at these news, not only in
respect of his majesty's honor and reputation, and likewise his state, which
entered very deeply into his excellency, considering what occasion was offered
hereby to all Princes christian, to conceive of his actions otherwise then
could well sound to his honor and credit, but also for ye regard and desire he
had to ye welfare, safety and preservation of all his subjects in general.
For though diverse and strange news had been brought to his excellency before,
yet notwithstanding he could never be persuaded to credit the^, being of
opinion, that ye rumor had been openly devised upon some grief conceived against
his majesty upon some pretended purpose, to defame his majesty amongst the
common people.

For which cause the message which his majesty sent by ye said Lord of
Villequier grieved his excellency very much, because it agreed wholly with
that rumor and report which he had heard before which before that time he
could not in any wise persuade him self to be true.

And although his majesty be not bound to make his excellency an account of
his doings and actions, and though his said excellency desire nothing more,
then that the Kings dealinges may be such as might be justifiable to every
private person, for the great good will and affection he bears to his
majesty: yet notwithstanding, his excellency being given to understand by the
said lord of Villequier what his will and intent is, his said excellency for
the zeal he bears to ye preservation of ye King his majesty's honor can do
no less but lay forth plainly before him what he thinks, and in singlenes
of heart show unto his majesty with no less plainenes and vprightnes then he
uses in all his doings what he is persuaded is most convenient not only for his
honor and ye safety of his person, but generally for his whole state, desiring
his majesty to take it in no worse part then he does mean it.

And first his excellency can not think, and much less ca^ he be persuaded to
believe, yt any man whatsoever he be either of honor or of good judgment yt
desires ye welfare and honor of his majesty, and preservation of his crown,
would ever counsel him to break ye edict of pacification yt was last made, and
disanul that which he had so solemnly sworn and protested to keep for ever
inuiolably and without breach in any point and article whatsoever.

For first of al in so doing he hazardeth al his honor and reputation, and al
hope he might have to grow greater hereafter, in so much as there is no
orname^t so precious and well beseeming either kings, princes, or other noble
me^ and gentlemen of what degree and quality soever they be, as to keep their
faith and promise inuiolably. As on ye otherside there is nothing ye sou^deth
more to their discredit and dishonor, or yt which draws ye good wills and
peoples hearts from them, or is so preiudicious and hurtefull to their
greatness, as to speak one thing in word, and to do an other thing in deed.
All historyes both ecclesiastical and profane, all examples as well ancient as
modern teach us and witness unto us, not only how shameful a fault this is
in the sight of men, but also how displeasing it is to God himself, who has
in former time poured out his just judgment upon them that have faulted in the
same. To which purpose his excellency cannot but lay before his majesty
amongst an infinite number of others, the example of Ladislaus King of
Hungary, Boheme and Polonie, that dead is, who because he suffered him self to
be persuaded by the Pope and Cardinals upon a wicked and folish color yt he
should be easily absolved afterward, to break his promise which he had
given, not to one yt made profession of Christianity, but to Amurates Emperor
of the turks and enemy to ye christians, did by ye occasion not only leese
his kingdom but also his life and what else soever he had in ye world, and
moreover and besides yt, his head was, to ye great dishonor and shame of all
christe^dom, carried throughout al ye towns of Asia. As his excellency has
declared more at large this pitiful history and certain other to ye same
effect, to ye said L. of Villequier, being moved with ye desire he has to
preuente the mischief which is like to ensue, for the sincere affection which
he bears to the weal of France, and only of purpose, yt they might serve
for a looking glass and example of others, not yt he desires in any wise that
any such inconvenience should befall to his majesty, which is a thing
farthest from his thought, as the said lord of Villequier can inform him and
is well able for the sufficiencye that is in him to give his majesty a vewe
thereof.

Who has moreover to wey and consider diligently in him self what troubles
and inco^ueniences, yea what bloodshedde he is to look for in his kingdom,
and what calamities are like to ensue thereof, as also what issue may be
hoped for of those kind of dealings: for moreover and besides that it will be
a very hard matter for his majesty, to root out, not only those that are
next of his blood, but also so many thousand persons which are all his own
subjects. And desire nothing more then to employe both their life and goods
and whatsoever else they might have in this world for the service of his
majesty, it is also greatly to be feared, yt the same men perceiving now what
his intent and purpose is, and being clean out of hope for ever to come to any
reconciliation or to purchase the favor of their Prince and natural Lord: And
seeing them selves clean shut out of all hope of quietness hereafter, be not in
fine constrained for the preservation of their lives and goods, to resort to
the last and extreme remedy, which may be very preiudicious both to his
majesty, and also to the whole crown of France.

And also it will be very hard and a matter of great difficultye for his
majesty to kick against the prick, and to pluck out of the hearts of his
subjects by force a known and persuaded truth, and to stop the course of
ye holy Gospel which the Lord will have spredde abroad every day more and
more, yea, though it were so yt his majesty were able (as happily many men
desire) to root out al his subjects which make profession of the same reformed
religion, what should his majesty do otherwise therein, but to the great hurt
and decay of his kingdom, dismember one of his arms, yea the best arm he
has, and so weake^ him self more and more, and bereue and spoil him self of
his own forces.

And though some persuade his majesty that to have two diverse Religions in his
kingdom is the cause of those troubles and dissesions which fall out there, and
in case he suffer the^ both, he shall not be able to keep his subjects under
that obedience which they owe to their superioures, for proof whereof, they
allege ye Princes and Electors of Germany, who will not suffer wtin their
territories ye exercise of any religion, save of yt which they profess
themselves yet notwtstanding his excellency doubts not, but yt his majesty
knows right well, yt by the agreement made in the Empire for the matter of
religion, there is with in the same, free exercise of them both permitted, and
he knows that the same order is observed in the kingdom of Polonie. In like
sort did the Emperor that dead is, of most famous memory, and so does his
son the Emperor that now is, suffer within his territories and in many
towns, yea, even in his court at Vienna, free exercise of two religions: by
means whereof was maineteyned in all respects as it is also at this day,
very good peace and concord in Germany. And so in like sort ye kingdom of
France consisting of many and diverse provinces, is in no respect to be compared
to any one prince or elector of Germany, not only because there is no
proporcion comparable, but also because the said Princes and Electours did
never make any such solemn promise to their subjects, as his Majesty has
done to the^ whom God has committed to his government.

And therefore, his excellency prays his Majesty again, that he would not
suffer him self to be carried away with this persuasio^ that the sufferance of
the exercise of the reformed religion should be the cause of those troubles and
dissensions, which have continued to this day in France, for it is no new thing
for the Christians and professors of true religion, to be accused and blamed as
authors and causes of rebellion and sedition: for so it fared not only with
the holy Prophets and Apostles, but also with Jesus Christ him self, although
both he and they were wrongfully charged therewith and against all truth. But
that it would please his Majesty to believe and assure him self rather that
the stay and hinderance which some go about to make against the free course of
Christian Religion, is the only cause of all the calamities and miseries that
have fallen out heretofore, and may hereafter in ye kingdom of France.

And therefore his excellency prays and cou^selleth his May. as earnestly
as he can, yt he would have regard of his honor, of his faith and promise, and
of his reputation, to keep the^ safe and unattained, and also to wey
advisedly how much the matter imports him, how many and great inconveniences
depend thereon, and never suffer himself to be persuaded to have a mind to
follow a counsel which can never be put in execution, but it will be the utter
undoing of the same, the shedding of an infinite deal of blood, and is also
directly contrary to his faith, promise and word of a Prince which his
Majesty has given to his subjects, but rather that he would maintain and
confirm the edict of pacificatio^ that was last published, in all the points
and articles of the same. And in case his May. were desirous to make some
good accord in the matter of Religion, which surely were a Princely act and
worthy a Christian, he were best for the accomplishing of the same, to use not
the edge of the sword, but according to the example of his predecessors of
worthy memory, Constantine the great, Theodocius, and others, the sharp
sword of the word of God, by the means of a free and national counsel: for
it has been proper eue^ from the beginning and at all times for the Church,
and so shall it continue to the end, that seeing the foundation thereof has
been laid by blood, it shall never be rooted out by sheddi^g of blood, but the
more it is watered with blood, the more it shall increase, and stretche more
large abroad.

As for ye other part of ye charge committed to ye said L. of Villequier,
wherein his Majesty requesteth his excellency that he would have nothing to
do with them of the religion, nor minister them any aid or favor against him
in case he should be required to the same, his excellency would that his
Majesty should wit and understand, that hitherunto he has meddled with other
men's matters as little as he might, and especially never gave occasion either by
way of counsel or otherwise to his subjects to rise against him, and his
excellency hops that he shall have occasion ever hereafter (so that it may
stand with the safenes of his conscience) to continue in this good affection
and singular amity which he bears to his Majesty.

Whom he prays most humbly in this behalf to take in good part all that he
has said before, as proceading from a heart that bears a true affection unto
him, and respects nothing else but his honor and estimation, joined with his
prosperous and quiet state, and to show him self herein as becomes a King
that has a care to maintain his honor and reputation with all men, as his
excellency trusts God will give him the grace to do, which shall not only
tend to the advancing of Gods glory, but also generally to the whole estate
and preservation both of his person and all his subjects, and of his whole
Realm.

And this is all that his excellency could answer to yt which the said Lord
of Villequier had in charge to deliver unto him from his Majesty.
