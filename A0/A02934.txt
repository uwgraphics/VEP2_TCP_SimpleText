Of this most christian king in us it lies not
His time passed honor suffycyent to praise
But yet though that / that thing envalue we may not
Our prayers of suertye he shall have always
And though that atropose has ended his days
His name and fame shall ever be dred
As fer as phoebus spredes his golden rays
Though henry the seventh alas alas lies deed
But now what remedy he is vncouerable
Touchyd by the hands of god that is most Just
But yet again a cause most confortable
we have / wherein / of right reioys we must
His sone on live in beauty force and lust
In honor lykely traianus to shede
wherefore in him put we our hope and trust
Sith henry his fader alas alas lies deed
And now for conclusyon about his hearse
Let this be grauyd for endeles memory
with sorrowful tunes of Thesyphenes verse
Here lies the puyssaunt and mighty henry
Hector in battle / Vlyxes in polecy
Salamon in wisdom the noble rose read
Creses in richesse Iulyus in glory
Henry the seventh ingraued here lies deed
