THE COPPIE OF A Letter sent into England by a Gentleman from the Town of
Saint Denis in France. Wherein is truly set forth the good success of the
Kings Majesty's forces against the Leaguers and the Prince of Parmas power.
With the taking of a Conuoy of Victuals sent by the enemy to succor Paris:
And the grievous estate of the said City at this present.
AFter that the Prince of Parma was come into the dominions of France, he
sought opportunity where he might best plant himself and his army in
safety, meaning by policy first to settle himself in some part of the Kings
regiment, and to come with such force as upon sudden the king could not
remove, except he should raise his siege from before Paris, and then to make
war upon him, which were greatly to the kings hinderance, and the great
advantage of the enemy, for while the king had bin making war upon him, the
Leaguers might have had the easier means to have brought in fresh men and
victual to have comforted that City, which is in wonderful distress, and
the famine so grievous among them, as it was never greater at the siege of
Jerusalem. The true estate whereof is in most lamentable sort discoursed in
the latter end of this Letter. But the king whose magnanimity is known and
found sufficient throughout the kingdom of France, perceiving the intent and
policy of the prince of Parma, neither meant to raise his siege from the City
of Paris, nor to suffer that part of Picardie to be unfurnished for the
princes welcome. For having planted that notable warrior Monsieur de la Now,
his principal lieftenant for those parts, being a man known to be both
politic and wise, and for martial affairs found and approved to be one of
the best in all France. This Monsieur de la Now hearing of the princes policy,
who came thither with xx. thousand men, divided them into three parts, and
purposed that one part should go unto the town of Lanie, being in number
three thousand, other five thousand should depart another way for the succor
of the Leaguers, and to enlarge the army of the Duke de Maine. The rest he
determined should stay with his own person, whom he seemed at the first to
conduct back again toward Brussels, but on a sudden took another way, and
passed with his power toward Artoyes, where with great policy he is planted,
yet far enough for doing any great harm, for he is ten leagues from the king,
and has entrenched him self within a wood, where he lies very strong. Thus
having dispearced his army into three parts, he appointed men of great
experience to be leaders of them, so that Monsieur la Now advised against
whether of the armies he were to join his forces, so he cast about and met
with the five thousand who were marching to join with the forces of du Maine,
and thereby to make him and the Leaguers more stronger, against whom he had
such good success, that he discomfited the greater part who escaped by flight,
but many of them came short home. And while la Now and his forces were thus
busied, the other three thousand went to a town called Lanie, where making
some show of battle, the governor thereof (as it is said) had before sold it
to the prince, and suddenly he yielded it, whereupon the soldiers who were
Spaniards issued in and most cruelly put the inhabitants thereof to the sword,
and for certainty those butcherly governors and soldiers not therewith
satisfied, did cut and mangle the dead carcases into pieces. Which when it came
to the ears of the king, he was very sorrowful, and wrote unto his governor
and forces in those parts, commanding them to revenge that bloody act, wherein
they ouerslipped no fit occasion for performing of the kings commandment. So
that within few days, notwithstanding that they had strongly entrenched
themselves, and seated a sufficient garrison therein, with the loss of a few
men the said town was recovered, and those in the town together with the said
soldiers recompensed with the like rigor. Which doubtless was but the just
judgment of God upon them, yea, the Captain who at the first had betrayed
the said town and sold it for a piece of money, was at the receipt of the
said money stabbed in with a dagger by a common soldier, who among them
reuelled away his Spanish reals, which he was receiving for his reward, even as
wickedly as he had purchased the same. Thus may we see how the just judgment
of God lights upon such wicked blood suckers, and although they are a small
time preserved from it, yet in the end it lights on their own heads to
their utter confusion. The prince of Parma having thus settled himself and
divided his forces, he prepared to send a Conuoie of victual to relieve the
City of Paris: There were furnished for this Conuoie five hundredth wagons
laden with victuals, namely beef (a meat little used among the French) with
mutton, and sundry sorts of fish both salt and fresh, with meal and corn
vnground. There was also in the same twenty hundredth dussen of bread all
ready baked, because of the great want of those in the City, who were in such
case as they would willingly have eaten the same raw, and the meal and corn
vnbaked, rather than they would have staid the dressing or baking thereof, so
grievous and extreme is their present famine, as after more at large
appears. The kings majesty having intelligence by his espials of this
Conuoie, and that such provision was coming from the prince toward Paris, he
determined with all policy and force to prevent the same, least the rebellious
Cities should take courage unto them, and thereby conceive to have some great
resistance by means of the enemies to the estate royal, and so take occasion
to triumph the more. This conuoie of victual, as I said before, being sent
toward Paris, came peaceably within four or five leagues of the place, being
guarded with a sufficient band of men, whereof the king having not only
intelligence, but also of a Captain which issued forth of the city of Paris,
who with fifteen hundred men went to meet and receive the said Conuoie of
victuals, sent forth presently diverse of his companies under the conduct of
the Earl Chastilion, who practiced not only to intercept their passage, but
also their returning back again, in which service the kings faithful subjects
so courageously behaved themselves, that in short time they had their desire,
for on a sudden being in a readiness, they had a sight of the said wagons whom
in short space they took, and slew all those soldiers that came with the said
Conuoie to defend the same, and made so hot an assault upon the soldiers which
issued sorth of Paris, that they were al taken and slain with the loss of a
few of the kings soldiers. The princes forces understanding by their scoutes
what had happened, durst not come on nor approach to resist the kings forces,
while they were in fight with the Conuoie, whereof the valiant Chastilion
having intelligence, venturouslie set forward, and with the kings forces made
toward them, and after a fierce and valiant assalt made by them upon the
enemy, who at the first gave a very strong and stout resistance, they were
all put to ye sword, saving some few who escaped by flight, but never a man of
those escaped alive which issued forth of the City of Paris.

Thus with great joy the said Conuoie was brought into the said town of Saint
Denis, the value whereof is by common estimation thirty thousand pounds and
better, being so much victual as they could in reasonable sort provide for
them in three months.

But so soon as the Parisians heard of this news, they were wondrous
sorrowful, and were filled with so great heuines, that they rested out of all
hope to live to see the day when any succor can be sent them by the enemy: and
are at this present persuaded, that all that ever the Prince of Parma can do
for their relief, is but to linger in that place where he is, and so to weary
the king by detracting of time as he did in the low Countries, when he came
thither first.

Since this discomforture of the enemy, the Duchess of Guize, the Duchess of
Maine, Le Cheuallier de Aumale, and diverse other of the chief of the Leaguers
have disguised themselves in simple attire and thereby secretly issued forth of
the said City: by means whereof they are secretly escaped, being not able any
longer to endure the unspeakable famine that is in the same: for the
Launce-knightes even against nature and reason are through the extreme famine
constrained to eat their own natural children.

Before this Conuoy aforesaid, came down toward Parris, the prince of Parma
after he had entrenched himself in this wood, in the middle whereof is a
strong Castle, he sent five hundredth of his horsemen to take view of the kings
Camp: who were espied by two hundredth of the kings horsemen, those two hundredth
set upon them and chased them into their own Trenches, where within their own
Trenches and in the way to the Trenches they were all slain.

The prince of Parma, will not by any means enter into battle with the king,
although he have been very much urged thereunto, yea, he has endured the
terms of cowardice for his often denialls, having had much advantage offered
him to enter the field, wherein he excuses himself in this sort, that he has
no commission from the king his master, either to make battle or to fight in
the field against the French king: and that his only charge was to vittaile
Parris if he could, and to succor those of the League with his Forces and
Council. And with this resolution, he continues still in the said place,
without offer of any fight, except some small skirmishes between his and the
kings Soldiers.

It could not but be a great comfort unto the people in their misery, when the
king received some of them with great courtesy and gave them food, which drove
the rebellious Nobillitie openly to confess, and from their hearts to think,
that he was a king of wonderful virtuous and merciful disposition, and would
gladly have yielded themselves, if their repentance might any way have pacified
the kings displeasure, but for as much as they did all know, that the king who
is and ever has been a true fulfiller of his word and promise, has made an
oath, that none of the conspirators of the deceased kings death shall escape
and remain pardonable, but that he will be revenged of them for their
unnatural treason, and that nothing but their lives shall pacify their
heinous murder committed: and in respect thereof, they keep themselves so
long as they may out of the kings hands. The French king God be thanked, is
wondrous well provided of all things fit for war, and with him is joined all
the chiefest nobility and princes of France: he has of footmen thirty
thousand, and seven thousand Horse. And with this Army the king continues
still against Parris, which City is not likely to hold out long, especially by
reason some of the chief of the leaguers is fled from thence, whose
countenance daily held them in awe. The Lord God bless and prosper the kings
royal Majesty, and send him the victory over all his enemies, to the glory
of God and advancement of his holy word, for there was never in France a king
of so noble a courage, so skillful in the wars, and so hardy against the
proudest foe, which is all the grief the enemies have, because they have to
deal against so valiant a Soldiour.

From Saint Denis the second of September. 1590.
A TREATISE CONCERNING THE EXTREME FAMINE OF THE CITY of Paris at this
present: which is as grievous as it was at the siege of Jerusalem.
THe Kings Majesty, having often heard of the great famine and miserable
calamity, whereinto the obstinate parisians had wilfully plunged themselves,
only through the persuasio^s of the cheifest of the leaguers side, being for
the most prat of the Clergy. And albeit the extremity were great, where into
they were fallen, yet the report of the increased misery, since that time has
sounded so lamentable in his royal cares, and amongst all the rest of his
princely and honorable train, that the remembrance thereof will not easily
pass or be raced out of mind: the certain truth whereof, is as follows.

After the king had entered S. Denis, as you heard long since with all his
power, and that he was in full possession thereof, The Citizens of Paris issued
forth to the king.
there issued out of Parris diverse and sundry times many poor creatures,
resembling rather the Anotamies of death, then people possessed with life, so
sore were they wasted with famine, and consumed through extreme hunger, that
excepting the skin, there was nothing left to cover their feeble bones. So
that it prevailed nothing to be young or bewtifull in this case, or to boast of
health, or to have heaps of gold, for their stomachs desired that, which for
gold nor silver could be gotten, yea their very hearts failed them for want
of necessary nourishment, whereupon they became careless of life, desiring
death or speedy delivery from this their miserable estate, that they might no
longer behold with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, the bitter cries of
their starued children, and the wonderful multitudes of their friends and
kindred, which for want of food daily died within that populous and great
City. Resolved therefore to finish their doleful days, or to find relief
for maintenance of their loathed lives, with leave of the cruel governors
they issued (as I said before) out of the City, and presenting them selves
before the kings soldiers, fell down at their feet, yielding them selves to
the kings mercy, about the number of a score at a time, men, women and
children, who being brought incontinent before his roial majesty, so soon as
they entered his sight, with bitter tears trickling down their cheeks they
prostrated themselves at his feet, and as loud as their feeble voices would
serve, they cried, Viue le Roy, God save the king. His majesty amazed at the
view of so pitiful a spectacle, The kings merciful heart.
and moved with a kingly compassion toward them, saw with his eyes and
conceived in his heart, what intolerable famishment the obstinate City had
alredie endured, but having a desire to learn further of the state thereof,
after he had well viewed the persons of these miserable men, he demanded of them
the intent of their coming. Whereupon they returned this answer, that
forasmuch as they were not able any longer to endure the grievous famine
whereinto they were brought by the long and deserved siege which his Majesty
maintained about their City, and being brought so low, that the governors
could not by reason of their weakness imploie them in any service, they had free
liberty to depart the City if so they thought it convenient: as being people
that were likely with many more in the City, to cause an infection to arise by
means of sickness among the rest of the inhabitants, wherefore, said they, most
noble and victorious king, we are come unto your Highness, acknowledging that
we are unworthy of any longer life, by reason we have bin most unjust and
rebellious subjects, The Citizens kept by constraint.
and unworthy that so gracious and merciful a prince should open his mouth
unto us, nevertheless, most mighty king, had it not bin through wicked
persuasions, we had never yielded to hold on so cursed a side, but with whom
persuasions could not prevail, they used means to enforce, being well assured
that they hold the most part by constraint, whose bodies being enclosed
within the stony walls of Paris, have every day their hearts infolded with
their king, considering within what small compass there is food enough with
favor and gentleness to be gotten, and yet they be at the point of death even
for a small quantity of bread, that may with their eyes behold even plenty
among beasts while they themselves pine and cannot come by it, whereby the
difference is showed betwixt the favor and fury of a king, and therewithal,
the recompense of obedience and rebellion:

We confess therefore, most noble king, that th mighty and just God has bent
himself against us and poured forth the violl of his wrath over these
traitorous confederates of the Leagures, of which number we must of force
account and acknowledge we have too long been, and therefore we humbly submit
our selves into your majesty's hands, to deal with us as it seems good in
your sight.

His Majesty having heard this lamentable complaint, revived their hearts with
a favorable countenance, and according to his princely disposition, in a mild
manner demanded what provision of victuals (in their judgments) remained yet
in the city, and what it was wherewith they hoped to sustain the lives of so
infinite a multitude as remained in the town, wishing to declare the same in
all truth and simplicity of heart, even as they would hope to find mercy at
his hands for their known and manifest rebellion, and how long time they
supposed the same would last.

Before the mighty and dreadful God of heaven, who knows the secrets of the
hearts, and shall judge the thoughts that are hatched by untruth, so will we,
said they, show and declare this to the king, as far as our memory and
knowledge does stretch. And if your majesty find us false let the same be
recompensed with the vildest death that ever any did endure. And herewithall
one of them who was known of best judgment, and that had been of great
account in times past, put forth his voice before the king, and most part of
the princes and nobles about him, Necessity finds many shifts.
speaking as follows.

Necessity the whetstone of man's wit, having enforced me among these my
companions and sorrowful associates, with an infinite multitude of my friends,
kinsfolk and neighbors to search for sustenance, for the maintenance of me
and my poor wife and children, Necessity finds many shifts.
inquired by all means after food when it became scant in the City, being
the only care that every person had to seek for the same: and albeit after a
small time that we were beseeged, wholesome food was kept wonderful close and
scant among us, yet our ears were ever so diligent to hearken after it, that
by one means or other we always heard where it was to be had for money, and
although the provision was great within the city, yet by reason of the
marvelous multitude of inhabitants, within five months after, there was no
wholesome food to be had for gold nor treasure, for the Nobles and principal
of the city, suspecting a long seege, got as much thereof as they could for
their own provision, and the cloisters with the university did the like: and
as for the Clargie, they stayed not behind any in that matter, being men wise
enough to take the choice before all other, by which means the common sort of
the Citizens soon found the smart thereof, and in vain sought they after that
they could not find: when flesh failed, butter and cheese began to grow
precious at rich men's tables, though at the first they much repined thereat, as
people that had not been much acquainted with such course cates. But the just
God seeing our unthankful hearts, that scorned his gifts, and despised his
blessings, in two months after sent such a change, Rats, mice and other
vermin good meat in Paris.
that the flesh of Horses, Asses, Dogs, Cats, Rats, Mice, Weasels, and Moles,
became dainty dishes at gentle men's tables, and bore such a price, that no
poor person was able to compass any, and then our queasie stomachs began to be
contented with any thing, were it a frying pan full of Frogs, a dish of
snailes,, or a Skellet full of garden worms sod in broth: she that went in her
hoode, would have been glad to have licked her lips after them, and would
have bidden her dearest friend to the banquete, had he not been of her own
household, so sweet a sauce and so sauory did hunger make the same to taste,
and yet many of those that thus have fled, and yet would be glad to meet
with the worst of these things rehearsed before they felt the force of hunger,
with many oaths, said they would starve unto death before any such corrupt
thing should comfort their stomachs, and yet was all this but a taste of
famine, and nothing comparable to that which afterward fell upon us, for in
short time our bread of pease, tares, oats and acorns utterly failed us, so
that none could be had or found in any place to be sold, although we would
have killed one another with thrust, to have gotten the quantity of a farthing
loaf (far worse then any which in former time we gave our horses) though we
would have given a French crown for so much, and those vermin also that we
prepared and dressed, as before is showed, was on all sides so caught up and
eaten, that in the end there was none to be gotten, neither for one nor other:
and then began such mortality through famine, Ten thousand dead of famine in
Paris.
that ten thousand have already dyed thereof, as may be seen in the register
book, and at this present, ten thousand more are like to perish through the
like extremity. A most grievous and intolerable burden sufficient to enforce
a flinty heart to remorse and pity, how great a warning ought this to be to
all cities that are in a flourishing estate, where plenty pours forth her
treasures, in so much that delicacie is become loathsome, in respect of an
insatiable desire, and daintiness will not be contented without great
superfluity, every man wishes for better, and no man thinks that he has
goods enough, and few remain thankful for any thing: consider, you that use
excess, and will not so much as lift up your eyes, much less your hearts, to
render praises for so great benefits, consider (I say) how joyful and glad many
nobles and men of great worship would be of the worst bit or bone that you
fling under the table to your dogs, while your selves in the midst of your
excess, sit turning with your knives point, the meat in diverse dishes, and
can scant among them all find one morsel to fit your fancy, notwithstanding
how gladsom a present the least of your loaves would be in Paris, let those
imagine that can conceive of their misery, and how many would entreat upon
their knees, to be preferred, as it were, to the shaking of the table cloth, or
carrying away of the trenchers. Undoubtedly, I am persuaded, that if the
daintiest mouthed dame in Europe had but one months experience of the like
want, she should afterward while she did live, esteem better of the least
crumme, then she does now of all the dainties upon the table. I beseech God be
merciful unto us, and forgive our unthankfulness, and grant us grace to reform
our lives, lest we be plagued for our leudnes. But to return to the former
matter.

The King having heard this doulefull discourse, proceeded further, The kings
second demand.
and demanded whether before their issuing forth of the City, they had found
no means whereby they of the town might have something to put into their
bellies to strengthen the heart, and to help the stomach, and abate the fury
of hunger.

Three weeks (said the reporter) we continued without any sustenance, save
only Flies and Beettles, Flies and Beetles.
whereby we sought to sustain our selves, with diverse other like things, till
in the end our empty intrels enforced us to seek some means for relief, at
what time the people devised to gather all kind of roots such as grew within
the compass of the walls, which being partched or otherwise dried, we ground
them in a mill, and therewith made us bread, but alas, slender comfort
conceived we thereby, though we were glad of any thing, for in less then two
days, our people were constrained to find some other remedy against hunger,
whereupon it was devised to saw all the timber we could come by and convert
it into dust, Bread of saw-dust.
and thereof to make us another sort of bread, which device continued longer
then many of the former, and contented us a great deal better, by reason we
had some quantity thereof to fill our empty stomachs, but this was not to be
had without money, except a body had of their own wherewith to make it, in so
much that all the wood plankes and bordes which conveniently we could come by,
was put to that use, and when this began to grow something scant, every man
having care principally to nourish himself and meditating daily how to invent
means to procure sustenance, being a thing wherein every one applied his wits,
at length the extremity was such, that the Churchyardes were dug for dead
men's bones, and all the said bones they carried together into one place in the
city, Dead men's bones eaten
where they might lie from the rain, the which afterward being washed and
dried, were beaten in pieces and ground, and thereof an other sort of bread
was made, and thus we were glad to feed our stomachs with the bones of the
dead. In which time if it may please your Majesty to pardon my long and
tedious discourse, I am to declare a most woeful accident which then happened.
Men worth twenty or thirty thousand pound made common soldiers.


There was then dwelling among us, a very honest and substantial man, which
was Sargeant over one of our companies, for the skill they found to be in
him, who was employed as were the rest of the Citizens to be a soldier in the
City for those which of late were esteemed men worth twenty or thirty
thousand pound, were enforced to become common soldiers, whose substance
thereby is wasted and brought to nothing, so much need have they of men in the
city. This Sargeant before spoken of, coming home to his house about seven
days ago, his wife and his children came presently running about him, hoping
he had brought something for them to eat, at what time there was a neighbor
or two in the house staying his coming, and with his wife lamenting the common
calamity, hoping from his mouth to hear some news of the yielding up of the
City into your highness hands. But the cries of the starued children
interrupting the talk betwixt him and his neighbors, the poor man with a
sorrowful heart sat him down, fetching a deep sigh, not knowing what to do
for them, the children still cloying his ears with their pitiful
complaints. Ha Father, said they, will you see us dye for want of bread? if
there remained any thing upon our bones beside the skin, The complaint of
children for lack of food.
we would not let to feed thereon: but if no other remedy may be found, let
the one of us serve for food to the other, or else spare not our lives to feed
our mother and you, better were it for us by death to be rid of our misery,
then to endure a famine the end whereof is unknown: is there ought in this
City save men to feed upon? why may not the one of us devour the other
alive, or why are the dead bodies of men covered in the ground that might
serve a hungry stomach to feed upon. The father looking upon them with a
heavy heart, after many tears shed on every side, having pondered these
speeches, started up as a man purposed to give them encouragement, and with a
comfortable voice briefly said unto them, be content my children, and be of
good cheer, so soon as these my friends are gone, I will give you that which
shall content you, but alas, if it were sufficient for us all, I would be loath
to part with their company, notwithstanding I hope they consider the time as it
is, and will not think any discourtesie herein, being assured, themselves in
the like case would do the like to me, then turning to his neighbors he
said, the time has been we would not have denied our meat, but our money,
but now our money is nothing in respect of our meat, and woe be unto them that
would not give the poor money to buy meat where it is to be had, wherefore I
beseech you leave us a while till we have refreshed our selves, then after I
will answer any thing I shall hear spoken by you: hereupon the two men
departed, and shortly after, knowing that their dinner lasted not long, these
persons went again thither, knocking and calling for him, maruelling that no
body came to make answer, wherefore being very familiar friends, and
suspecting they had been in their upper chamber, went up, whereinto they no
sooner entered, but presently they espied the good man, A man first hanged his
wife and children, and after him self for lack of food.
his wife and two children (about the age of fourteen years) all hanged one
beside another, and a bill upon the good man's breast, wherein was written, By
this means did I first set my wife and children out of misery, and after my
self, for which offense I ask the Lord mercy and forgiveness: and that your
highness may be the better satisfied of the truth hereof, the men be here that
first heard his words, and after were woeful witnesses of this Tragedy, in
such extremity remains this miserable City.

His Majesty that scant could refrain tears to hear this doleful
discourse, The Parisians causers of their own destruction.
answered: Ah Paris, thy blood be on thy own head, it is thy self and not I
that has caused this great calamity, the Lord be witness twixt thee and me,
and reward me after the innocence of my heart? after these words causing the
starued people to be refreshed, he departed into his chamber, commanding that
no more should be suffered to come forth of the City in such sort.

Thus have you hard the good success of the Kings Majesty, whom no doubt,
Almighty God prospers and preserves, with the evil success of rebellious
people, and the enemies against Gods truth, whom he in justice punishes, and
does in his just judgments bring to confusion: Almighty God still prosper the
kings proceedings, and send confusion to his enemies, except they speedely
repent and yield themselves unto him, as in right they ought, which God
grant. Amen.
