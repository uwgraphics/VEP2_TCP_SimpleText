The prologue to my lord, my lord (...) of (...)
ROULIN ^in mind, the (...) estait:
Of mortal men, and infortunitie,
The heavy laubour, travel and debait,
A mixed to theme, from their nativity.
Spa^ring no man, of h^e nor low degree,
I sand nothing, moir trewlie of to treait:
Than prove man subject, unto misery.
Yet seeing that, the worldly foolish men,
Can not parsaiue, this sentence to be sure,
I thought it good, for to prepair my pen:
This to discriue, with all my busy cure,
Of sapience: all thought I be impure,
Yet know I well, that God will grace him leu:
That callis on him, with con^idence most sure.
Upon non other, therefore will I cry:
But only, on that Lord celestial,
Thought poetis used, in there poetry:
On many sindry; goddesses to call,
How far from wisdom, did those ^oles fall,
On such a wise: their pennis to apply,
Where help was none, for to be had at all.
O Lord her (...) made (...),
The Sun, (...), the (...),
All sishe: and (...), herb and g^^wing ^^ie,
The stars, rainebow, air and (...),
O thou that know, my mind and whole intent,
(...) me? with thy Spirit of verity:
To dite, and write, my purpose subsequ^^t.
It is an Myrour, Lord I muse to make:
Wherein all Christians, may behold and sie,
Their sinful lives, they l^^d with sham^ and lake,
In to this world, and ^a^ll of m^serie,
It is a^ glass that pa^^tes ou^ specially,
The sharp threatning^^, the ^^^ did o^ us take,
Declaring, if we sinned we sh^^de die.
And how that Aedam: our progenitour,
In Paradise did breck the Lords command,
Heir may thou (gentle reader) any hour:
That cairfull ca^ce, per^^telie understand,
His enemies all, that held Adam in band,
And how that Christ, became his Sa^^our
And made us (...) whom he in bandage fand.
The second part: declares to the plain,
Of the poor ^^^^er, an co^fessione,
How he has spent: his life and time in vain,
And how he does (...), his great tr^sgress^o^e,
Which he has used, a contra^^e his professione:
And how that Christ, our Lord and souerai^e:
Has saved him, his sede, and his successione.
And last of all, here (...) thou see:
Now that all they, (...),
Must (...) truble, and (...)
As did our (...),
And all his Prophets, from the beginning,
^ere persecute, and (...) patient lie,
As we must do, if we with Christ would ring.
And when I had, this volume fabricat:
And put in rhyme* in rude and rural st^^^,
With heart, and hand I did it dedicat,
To you my Lord, then master of Argile,
Though from your presence, I was many mile:
^et hearing of your honor auriat,
Bent to Goddis word, I did the same compile.
And though it be, of cloquence de^^de,
It is no wondir, for when this work I wroght:
As I do yet, then small I understood,
Of books nor autours, to study had I noght,
Which unto knowledge, of Scripture should me brought,
For preso^er, I was then to conclude:
In the Bastillie, where such could not be boght.
Four years in prison, they held me their express,
Four mo^ethes, and four wekes als certain,
Four days, four hours, in nombre and no less,
I did into the Bastillie remain:
For Gods word, as it is known plain,
And for no laws, that I had done transgress,
Nether to God, nor to my soucraine.
Heirfor (...) it sinell not of (...)
But is of (...) and cade^^^, cl^^ne con^^^^^
All gentle (...) I pray you h^^^tfull^e:
To hold me partly, in s^^e ca^se crcu^^^
Seeing I was then, in presone inclu^it,
Where I might no wise, use my liberty,
Thought some disprayse it: I ^ouet non^ to ruse^^.

THR^ Inimics, had Adam principal, ^. Cor. 3. Romans ^. Psalm. 14. 1. ^or. 15

That maid him s^laue, to theme after his fall.
The law was one, that did torigour leid,
The nixt was sin, and the third so was deid,
The law by right did ruell, and was his guide:
But sin right sone, their under did him hide.
First under law, sin sand occasion:
To shawe him self, then gave possessione, 1. Cor. ^^

To Satan, as the law bears witness.
After that Adam, knew the will express,
Of God, then Satan raging began to spring,
To tempt man's flesh, and theirin to ring:
Where he maid it thrall, to these fois three, (...). (...).

Of sin, the law and deaths extremite.
The Law to man, did Ceriouslie command: (...). 12. ^al. ^. 1. ^or. 15

To obey God, the flesh did it withstand,
Because it could not, all the Law fulfill:
Maid place to sin, and leit him work his will.
So sin to death (...) passage by his might,
Then death began to (...) and was most wight,
Those three didso^e, their high power persaue: (...). ^. Heb. ^.

Their great impire, and paussance they did have.
upon an day, their loud trompettes did blaw, Exodus 19

On ^^ high rock, sin down to us did shaw.
The sharp decretes, and laws most austear. Ephe. ^.

With sore threatninges, right horrible to hear,
In wildi^nes, which barraume was of fruit:
Of herb or grass, it was cleue destitute,
Men lost their time, to laubour or manure, Exodus 19

All was but stony rocks, and haddry mu^e,
Without moistues, as do our fathers tell:
Replete with dragons, and with serpents fell.
This mount was named, in Hebrew Sinay,
And called Agar, in Arrabic I say:
With fearful rocks, so hie was never seen,
With mistie clouds, whose tops was couerd clean:
His widdered head, bald, bentic black and baire,
Whose hiddious hight, was moutid in the nire.
So that few durst approach, or yet cum nere:
That ugly mont, for terror and for fere.
On that mont fand the Law a propre place:
For till disclose, and shaw her rigorous face.
In mids of that mont, a^ seat was wroght,
Right rich and lucent, where their lacked noght,
All round a bout that face, an fire did flow: Exodus 19

That kest huge light, with fire and birning low,
Like as the hole mont, would consume and burn:
They thought suddanly, it would in puldi^ turn.
One such an wise men thought, that fire (...) Deuteronomy. 4.

would burn the heaven, the earth, and (...)
Which signified, an great puissance amoued,
With ire, and wroth, where al should be reproved:
Such sum, with darkness, A fire proceeding bold
A stonist all, the folk did it behold.
Above this fire, an ouglie cloud astayed,
Whose heavy hew, all regions made affrayed:
None other ways, these vapors did appear:
Nor when the son, is most serene and clear,
As when before, the thundre cumnis one blot,
Likewise abode, this black and heavy spot.
With sad and heavy womb, withouten mirth,
All ready to bring forth, and beir an^ birth.
Which signified, to every wight certain: Ben. 6.

God ready to distroye, the flesh humane.
The golden bow, was not seen ready bent:
Nor yet his purpour, co^llours consequent,
That God him self, of his beniguitie,
Gave in token, and gage, to signify:
By his divine, and royal ordinance,
That he by ^^oudes, nor waters abundance,
No more again, the world he would destroy:
Which leag of love, he made to father Noye.
And sindry times, yet we may see our sell, Ben. 9.

Now that a cloud, begins to grow and swell,
By Gods might, to molifie the ground,
Numeditie makes fruits till abound.
Great difference is, betuix these Clouds twane,
The one betokneth grace, the other pa^e.
With fire slaughtis, tumbling and sterilitie, Exodus 19

With thundering, roaring and calamity.
In mids of this cloud prodigious,
There sat the Law, both hold and rigorous: Romans 8

With sad and heavy, (...) decreit,
To vex and noye, of man the flesh and spreit. Col. 2.

O heavy sentence which we can not withstand,
Who shall us plit, forth of thy yoke and band?
O hard and cruel, art thou all to giddi^,
O judgment sharp, and fearful to considdir: Ephe. 2. Deuteronomy. 11, 17, ^ 28.
Leuit. 2.

Saying that mercy, ought not to be shawn,
To them that is, with sin infect and known.
Decerning us all, wicked and forlorue,
That is of sinful sede, consauit and borne. Deuteronomy. 12 and 17.

All man is cursed, was writtin there intill,
Which did not hole the laws charge fulfill,
Who then neglectis. they shall without remead:
Condamned be, to suffer double dead,
Cursed be his house, fruit, corn and bestiall,
That does not keep, these laws and precepts all.
O Israel, considdir consequent? Deuteronomy. 4, and 5. Exodus 3, and 4. Deuteronomy. 11, 17,
and 18. Leuit. 2.

The laws of God, in this his parliament,
I am says he, an God right Ielous,
That does behold, your leuing vicious,
On you shall bide, my indignatione:
Upon your sede, and generatione.
I am the God, that searches thy offense,
I send both hunger, derth and pestilence:
I move strong wars, and cruel battalles saire,
I kill, I slaye, I venge both layt and air.
He says not heir, he would thy father be,
To draw the forth of: woe and misery,
He said not heir, thy sin I wype away,
But with great bost, and (...) the did sraye:
His mighty tho^dring voice, (...) thou did heir, (...) ^^.

Then prayed thou, for terror bread and feire,
He would not speak, but with thy true co^ductour:
Whom he prepaired, to be thy just instructour.
His awful sight, did Moses sore molest:
Yet had not been, his hindir part celest,
Where he persauit, the humble sueit visage,
Of Gods Son, and the perfect image,
For verraye fear, he had died in that place:
No man on live, might look him in the face.
O poor Adam: who haith the ^astard wroght? Exodus ^^

Why fled thou him: that haith made the of noght?
Who haith the made: so vile and so sawaige:
To sly thy makers voice, and his langaige.
Who made the so: but sin that rest thy force,
Dishereist the, then show thy naked corce.
And sine when thou: was made of (...) al bare,
Thou would not grant, thy fault nor it declare, Ben. ^.

But thou durst (...), by one carnal way:
Excuse thy fault, and to the Lord did say,
The woman that thou made, marrow unto me,
She gart me eat, the aple of the tree.
Then sone after, of sin thou felt the price:
Yet weyed thou not, the burden of thy vice. Ben. ^. Ecclesi. ^^. Romans ^. ^^.

Because that sin, was first by the committed:
All thy hole raice, with ye same sinot was sinitted,
Before the Law, that sin was not expressed,
But the Law made it: plane and manifest.
As birning cooles, under the ashes ra^ked,
In sire do sleep, yet when they are awaked:
To their own nature, (...) incline ^ull right,
(...) their heat, (...) they shaw ye light.
Likewise before the (...), sin lay as dead, Romans 5* and 7. Osce 13.

And had no strength, to rise nor lift his head,
But when the Law: with might and force began,
Then sin vpstart, and he inuadid man, Rem. 7. Heb. 2. ^. Cor. 15

When he had wone: the battle and the pryse,
He led man as him list, at his devise.
And made him thrall, to all iniquity:
And made him bair, of bless and dignity.
Brought him in bo^daige, where he before was fra^ck:
For water of life, her filthy dubbis dranck: Genesis 3.

For odoriferant air, and fruits good:
He gat but cankered mist, and scrabs rude:
For constant conscience, and tranquillity: 2. Esd. 7 Exodus 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
and 11.

An trubled sprete, full of fragillitie:
This sin, I may compare to Pharo fell:
That never would, permit to Israel:
To part nor pas, forth of that painful place:
To honor God, nor thank him of his grace.
Sin that tyrane, to augment their woe:
As sleughound tried: their traces to and fro,
Following the footsteps, of the Law so nere: Apoc. 12.

Then subtell Satan, sweftelie can appear:
Them to accuse, with visage ^ul of scorn, Sap. 2.

Was never seen, an monster so defornie:
His ugly eine how holked in his head:
Was like to fyrebrandes, in an furnes read:
Ane stinking breathe, forth of his breast ran out, Apoc. ^0

His ^ongue the gaullis of dragons forth did spout:
His monstrous mouth, that many had oppressed,
Of hydra all the vennom: forth it ^est,
His silthie singers foull were fabricat:
With blood of men, they were ouerspred and wat,
Stryse, debait, blasphemy and occisione:
With torment ire: wroth and derisione,
Inuy pride, furor: and such an wicked meinze:
war of his court, all under an handseinze.
That he might better, his propose fulfill, Apoc. 6.

Ire from above, did give him strength at will:
And so persauing his force, great strength and might, Job 1, 14.

Then he began, to tempt all kind of wight.
There he red ^o^the, an story lamentable,
Saying I Satan, gart man hold as fable: Apoc. ^^

The word of God, and caused him neglect,
His first command, and hold of none effect.
There was remembered, the tree of saptence, Genesis ^, ^

With heavy thoghtes, and grudge of conscience.
There was how Adam, interprised to be, Esai^ ^.

Equal with God: his Lord in all degree:
And how that he forsuke, the word divine,
And for his lust, to Satan did incline.
There was also, marked manifestly:
Fraud and dissait, proceeding gre by grie:
with all abuses, forfaltes and offense:
That man committis, of will or negligence.
How sin took root, in maunis nature human Romans 3.

Is clearlie seen, and how it dois remain,
And how foolish: and ignairs war abused,
That thought throw ignorance, to be excused: 1. Cori^. 14.

A man that is, accused of an crime,
And would defend his cause, should he take syne, R^m ^.

For aduocat, and principal (...)
His accusars companion, day and (...),
Sir Iohne ignor^nce, is domestical:
To thy so, no officer in^ernall
That haith their master, moir seruit nor he 2. Cor. 4

Dar thou take such an man of Law for the,
Their never was man, that to him creddit gave:
But he lost their cause, and did theme cleine dissaue.
Their is no such so, to that word divine,
As ignorance, that leadis man to ruin. 1. Corin. 14.

Under whose wings, as an bie byke or hyue,
Is bred all vice: in any man on live,
As Paull does write, if thou thyselfe abuse:
Think not thy dotage, shall thy self excuse.
Seeing ignorance, many haith deuoird,
Who dotis at length, with daffing shall be sinoird.
Who will not join them selves, to discipline,
But still from knowledge, and wisdom will decline,
Without the Law: and be with vice inflammid, Romans 2,

Without the Law, so shall they be condemnid.
Their is some others, would an folly found,
Because the flesh, does in it felfe abound: Romans 8.

And of it self, from sin can not abstene,
Those ignorantes, without reasone maintene,
How all that lies not: in our fre will,
Should not to us, be holdin vice nor ill. 3. Reg. 8

As who would say, that God his creat^ure:
Wroght wrong to punish, the will of nature. Esa. 54.

Hearken and heir, an like similitude,
If in an harbere, among flowers good, Prouer. 21.

Spra^g bryeres or weides, of silth or bittirnesse:
Shulee men them pluck, or lat them still incresse?
By this reason, we should those every where,
The wolf the fox, the wod and bousteous bear,
To kill: all kind of tender bestiall, Gal. 5.

And lat all vermin, work their natural.
Thus when yt the flesh, does in such error rave,
It fredome seeks, and would all pleasures have. Deuteronomy. 18

The nature of the flesh, does still delight:
To case the self, and blame the holy write,
And would it wreist, unto an carnal sense: Esa. 3.

Whose reasones often are turned to offense,
Good intentes, without charity and faith, Zacha. 1, Romans 3, and 9.

Prouokes oftymes, Gods ire and wraith.
Silence to all men, is convenient,
And not but why, nor wherefore to invent
Oght of our selves: that can no good considder,
Seeing, that it haith pleased him to confidder,
The sins of Adam: upon all his raice, Esa. 43.

Is no remeid, but call on him for grace.
Then after sin, come death right doutable, Say, 1.

With birning brimstone: and oils horrible,
That no man might behold, for sincke and stink,
On Adam ran and said: as I do think,
Sen thou and all thy raice, haith done rebel.:
I shall the with thy seid, send down to hell. Apoc. 6.

Thus death in his right hand, one coupe he bair:
Full of cursing, of sorrow woe and cair:
With hard, and feirfull execrationes:
And with pestiferent inflammationes, Death for Satan.

For the desires of death, and his intent*
He dressed him sprinkle, his poisons pestilent,
On Jew on Greek, (...) other nation.
But where as fell, (...) ^ation, (...).

In haist they ware, (...) so appeir,
Where they with torments, terrors and with feir:
With double dolor, and with woe tyrannical, Apoc. ^.

They harled ware, to the pains infernal.
O poor Adam, take head and now behold,
How thy own self, has the wedsett and sold:
Under that hard: and terrible tutoure Romans 6.

Before the was set fire and water pure,
Thou had fre will, to choose in to that stead,
But thou r^fused life, and chosed dead: Romans 6.

Thou chosed thy ^o, for aye over the to ring,
That fello^e ^o was over the, both Lord and King,
To serve him as an sclaue, did the compel:
And for reward, ^^ prom^sse gat b^t hell.
Take head, of these thy so^s and considder,
How they have sworn, thy death all three to gidder.
All thought a foir, the wordles fundatione,
Before the coupe, of indignatione, Ephe. 1.

Before the Sun the Moon, or element,
God the Father, that is ommpotent, 1. Pet. 1.

Disposed and wroght, things all and some:
As they have been: and as they are to come. Apoc. 5.

Yet to himself, the Lord he has reserved,
An certain chosin: whom he will have preserved. Ephe. 2.

For to remain with him, in endless glore,
Where others shall thole pain, for evermore. Romans 9.

His elect people with grace, shall be possessed,
where the reprobat: never shall have rest,
In hell, according to his just iudgemen^* (...)

With weping gnashing, and with s^ir (...)
Though we our selves, can not this (...), (...)

^et must we needs believe, it so to be,
Saying also, o maker of heaven and land, (...) ^.

Who can or may, thy riches understand:
How heigh, how deipe: and how inscrutable
Are thy hid secrettes incomprchensable.
For thou have thine ^lect pred^stmat, Ephe. 1.

With all thy treasures, to be abumbrat,
From all dissaitfull, doctrine malignant, Romans 8.

Joining them, to thy true Church melitant,
That has not vainlie, taine thy talentes sweit:
But have brought forth, thefrutes of the Spreit.
They are thy chosin: by vocatione,
But not with rigor, or with violatione,
Thou have not suffered: them to be infect,
Nor yet to death, nor hell to be subject.
But have preserved: an nombre clean over all ^. Reg. 19.

That have not bowed, their bodies unto Baall*
To them was made, the promise infallable:
Of Christ, with miracles inestimable.
To save them all, from reprehensione, Romans 4, 8, 11, and 12

And did d^creit, In his intention:
To cleith them new, with judgment and justice
I mean with faith, their mother and nurice,
Sy^e with merciful eyne, ou them did call,
With ardent love, and petie paternall, Act. 1.

And where they war before, with Satan sold,
For to fulfill his promise then he would, Gal. 4.

Send down h^s hol^ word, in earth us till,
And with his word, the promise did fulfill. Ioh. ^.

And then (...), to make manifest, Man* ^^.

Where their should be, conuened from east to west,
Of all nationes an Church catholicall:
To praise and love, Gods Name perpetual. Col. 3.

And would also, that the eterue purpose,
Of the great s^bbothe and the great repose,
Should be confirmed, for an Testament, Heb. 2. and 10. Col. 1, 2.

Abiding the ransom, and the digne payment,
Of the lambs oblation, for them all:
And would, that the burdenes tyranicall, Ephe. 2.

The decrettes: of the laws bannishing,
Should die in them self, with all manashing:
And would that the enemies, all and some, Psalm. ^^^

Should be distroyed, vincust, and overcome.
For the of the power, that they did obtain,
And would all things, should be pure and cleine, Act. 5.

All Prophecies, to be fulfilled syne:
Before the coming, of his word deuyne,
This heavenly word, always victorious, Heb. 10.

Both strong wight, permanent and glorious, Apoc. 6.

By which the world, and the heavens all,

Teld with our flesh, infirm ^yne manfu^le, Heb. 2.

These enemies, about him round arreyed,
Satan to tempt him, haistelie asseyed: (...) 4.

In their assaults, thy war also assailled,
All three overcome, their puissance not a vailled.
Syne death his dart, at him threw in that stou^d, Apoc* 20

But his dart, him self wroght ye greittest wou^d,
Death thinking on him to win an advantage,
In to that battaill, lost both strength and ruraige: Heb. 1.

So our victorious captain, thus he ch^sed,
And though it best, till lat him self be sesed. Os^^ 13.

In dying so he raised, his fors agane,
To deaths prejudice, and meikle pane,
Death thou art dead, for all thy strength and might: 1. Cor. 15

Thou art no more, now vailleand nor wight,
Where is thy aufull dart and widdert ^orce?

Death where is thy sting: hell thy victory.

For Adams sede, alyke thou leads in thrall,

T^^irfor, I do confirm for man's love,
An testament eternal, the above.

To make my promise, faithful sure and sirm^, ^ar. ^^ Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11 2.

I did the same, with my heart blood confirm.
I swear be my own self unvariable,
It should remain, for aye perdurable.
So with my death, passion and sore torment.
I have confirmed, my new Testament.
Which is another: Testament I say,
Nor thy old fearful Law, of mont Sinay.
For thou by it, with rigor do require,
To all sinners: damnation, death and sire,
But my alliance new, shall rather rinne,
Out through the inward man, and pardon sin. Deuteronomy. 5.

Thou was but for the outward man in letter,
Rest now therefore, and make place to thy better, Romans ^.

Thy time is run finished and compleit,
Now mine is come, I frelie power my spreit, ^. Cor. ^. Gal. 3.

And s^ne the fruits, of the spreit forth bring.
Follow my holy word, and my doctrine,
Nether to right hand, nor to left decline.
My word and my command, is sufficient, Isay. 3.

Without additiones, of your own intent,
I am he, that ye should always in^ew, Ioh. 1^.

I have chainged, and done all things renew.
If ye in times past, were strange and nyce, 2. Cor. 5.

And far exilid, from my Paradise,
Yet but your merit, I shall of my own grace, Ephe. 2.

Restore you ^relie, to the ^amin place.
Come all ye, with sin that is unclean, Ephe. 1. Col. 1.

I have, with my own precious blood serene,
An wholesome bath: and stose prepaird for you,
Where ye shall be, made white as ani^ dow:
Of all my treasures, nothing ye shall want, Mat. 26. ^ocl. 2. Exo. 28.

But as my self, thereof participant.
As abundance of water christalline,
So shall I power on you my grace divine,
Right as the oil, was powered on Aarous head*
Which made his raiment, all in to that stead, Leuit, 9.

Smell of that balm, of savor dulce and sweit:
So shall my grace, be powered in your spreit: Act. 2.

Which I shall make, so plenteus on you rame,
That in to you, shall not be found an vain: ^* Cor. 2, 3, and 12,

Where as my holy sprite, does not abound: Heb. ^, ^ ^^.

From whence, that all your virtue do^th proc^^^,
Th^^s^ that ye confess in every place, Ephe. ^.

Not of your selves, but only of ^^ grace:
And of your filthy flesh, proceeded noght, Gal. ^.

That ever was good, in warke word or thought* Romans 13

Of my goodness and grace, I you it gave,
Before the time, ye did it ask or crave,
Except by me, ye can nothing posseid,
Therefore to me* and to my word take h^id. Ioh. 5, 6 Act. 4. Luc. 2^. 2. Pet.

Reid both the old and new law ye shall s^?
^^ have no good, but that which comes of me.
If some m^n would, by there inuentione found,
And so to big upon: an other ground,
Were it in heaven, earth or firmament: 1. Cor. ^.

Oro^ the sea, then say ye cons^qu^nt,
That sure building and fundam at their is none.
Except they found, their fortress^ me vpone.
These gracious words, ^unished a^ length,
This holy Savior, in his might and strength, Mat. 2^. Act. 1. Apo. 5, 7*

Propaird him: by his virtue divine,
For till ascend, where all the heavens syne:
Decoud them selves, with mirth and glaid curage,
To welcome him and mak^ him due homage,
There lamb, that on the hid s^crettes did look:
And was found digne, to oppen the holy book:
That all the Angels, had in such esteime: 1. Tim. ^ 1. ^oh. 2. Ioh. 17. Heb.
1^.

This lamb, ware on his head one diadeun^,
Where was writtin, three styles singulair:
In (...) letteres, to him peculiar, 1. Ioh. 2. Ioh. 17. Heb. 1^.

On^ (...), did him (...) call,
The second s^yle, our hie pries^ principal:
The third s^^l^ was, the Savior of all wight,
That in this world, did bring to us the lig^t,
And made his father, who is our soueran^ Lord:
On us poor sinners, to have mis^ricord.
This blessed Lord, and Savior most hie, Apo^. 21. Exodus 20

Both heaven and earth, togidder gartagrie,
In so far as the letter did conteane,
Promise and, law, so of right should perteane: Isay. 17.

The Lord should promise keep, and mercy shawe,
But man ought till observe, and keep the Law Heb. ^, and ^10

So Christ Jesus, to perform his office:
For that promise to show his benefice,
Offered his precious blood, his Father till:
And for oursake, has done the Lawfulfill.
So dyeinge on croce, that oblatione true,
Ended the Law, and took an style of new, Ephe. 2. 1. Tim. ^ 1. ^o. 12.

To be himself: our only Mediator,
He is that prince, that with his manly nature,
Has us redeemed, where we were damned to pyne.
Reasone and Scripture, would that we should syne,
Give him only: the gloir and to none other, Romans 4.

He is our Lord, our Savior and brother.
In that diadem, may be red in faith, Heb. 2. 3 7, 8, 9, 10

The lamb did meise, the Lords ire and wraith,
Where as before: could do no blood of beist,
He offered his own blood, as mighty priest.
But not as offered, the priests Leuitticall,
That offered for themselves, and syne for all,
Their sacrifice: nor their oblatione,
Could never bring us, to saluatione.
For God the Father, Lord omnipotent:
Was only, with his Sons blood content.
So Christ our Lord, was not bound Priest considder,
But Melchisedech: high Priest and King to gidder,
King of all piety, peace and equity,
And Priest that teached: the word of verritie.
And entered ones, in to the sanctuair:
By his own blood, his priesthood to declair,
Where he offered, his blessed flesh also:
Sufficient, for an thowssand worlds mo,
Blood of more strength, nor the blood of ^hell,
Better nor Nabothes blood, the truth to t^ll: Heb. 1^.

That asked vengence, from^ heaven to that place,
To fall on Iesabell, and I^habs race.
In dyeng Christ required, with mighty voice, Man. ^6

Pardon to them, that did him nai^l one croyce:
To death he neideth no more, him self present,
That one oblatione for all: was sufficient.
For death may now, no more that lamb Arr^ist, ^^^. 5, ^ 9, ^^.

O lamb, o King, o high Bischope and Priest,
Betwix us, and thy Fathers, fury stand:
Syne bless us, with thy right and holy hand. Gal. 4. A^^. 4.

(O man) if thou could with thy wit persaue?
The great ioy^, that thou throw Christ dois have, Romans ^.

Then should thy heart, with hope and esperance:
Be more stable, then rock but variance. 2. Para. 3.

Thou should not cair, of man the threatening bost^s:
Nor yet regaird, their strong and awful hosts.
Thou should cure, no punishment nor pyne, P^al. ^4*

Nor yet regaird, pest, hunger nor ruin.
Thou would not seir, fire: death nor helles pane: Phil. 4.

All earthly torment, thou would but repute vane,
If faithful love, thou in shy heart do beir:
To Christ our Lord, and to his word^ most cleir.
He is our pleader, for us in to the laws,
That venqueist Satan, and wan to us our cawes, Heb. 9.

Againes his ornate speech, and eloquence: 1. Tim. 1

The heaven nor earth, can make no resistance,
Satan nor death, dar pretend no action, Gal. 3.

Where Christ says I have made satisfactione.
This diadem, most worthy to aduant,
Is gar^eist, with these styles triumphant: Isa. 2, 4.

Which should not be attribute; trust ye sure,
Unto none other, earthly creature,
Nether to saint, nor Angel in the heaven,
Should those three styles, in any wise be given. Romans 8, and 11. 1. Pet. 4.
Exo. 34.

None ought the style of intercessione:
But Christ that bought it, with his passione.
As in times past, allace it may be seine,
How many have worn, an wail before their ein^
And stopped them, to se the light most cleir,
Of the bright Sun, with eyne of heart inteir. 2. Cor. 3.

As Moses: ware before an mistie race,
An vaill to hide the bryghtenes of his face,
Right so does were this waill: al the^ that would
Make Christ's Law, like to the laws old.
And may not se, the lambs liberality,
That is to say, who makes equality:
And would compair, the warkes of the Law, Ephesians. 2

To Christ's death, that grace to us does shaw,
Seking consaittes: and fassions of their own, I^bic. 1

The lamb to the^, will not be seyne nor known
Because at others: they have soght remeid,
Forgetting Christ, their chief captain and h^^^. Psalm. 1 6

This soul error, that does their conscience (...), Os^c. 9, and 11. 2. Cor.

Proceeds from ignorance: of holy writ
Ferther read forth, persaue and se the rest,
Behold the virtue of this lamb celest,
The more that is, considered his impire,
The more always, a man do^th him require,
With eye debonair, dulce and petious,
That their was never, man so dispitious, Romans ^*

Nor tyrane fell, that blood humane did seike,
Beholding him, he shuld^ come dulce and meike.
Sun on no day so bright did never shine Apoc. ^1*

Nor in Aurora, bright star matutyne,
In heaven, nor earth, is found nothing so fair: ^a^t. 1, 2, 3, and 4*

That to his golden face, I may compair.
The lyllie white consect, in vermeill rose,
Unto his beauty, can be no peir nor chose.
To his cleir color: of brightness triumphant
No precious stone, sapheir nor diamant, Apo^. ^1

Nor the charbonckle, with his lucent strandes,
May be compaird, to the brightness of his hands.
He is so full, of fragrant an^tie,
Sain^tes are enamourd, with his bright beauty: Apo^. ^, 18, ^ 19.

Men in this earth, left heritage and good,
To win his love, and serve his selcitude.
Rather chosing: to be bri^t at an slake:
Nor to renounce, his love and him forsake C^nt. ^

His vestament of gold, pure and s^reue.

The fair rubies, rich and iuestimable:
Declares his noble gifts incomparable.
Of his excellent, virtues her^icall:
Where as no Angel, nor Catholicall, Heb. 1. Psalm. 97

Did arrive, for ^lke one of them by measure,
Ressaued the holy Sprite, and consolature,
But he, after his own Sprite at his will, 1. Ioh. 5.

Took abundance, and gave all others till.
He is the fontaine, ^^oode, and springing strande: Apo. 21.

He holds life, and death in to his hand.
In that sweit lamb, we have our hole having, Phil ^. Gal. 3.

From him does al our health: and welfair spring.
Above this rob: their was an brawe brodoure,
In golding lettres, containing this scripture. Apoc. 19. Rom 14 Esa. 5. Act. 2.

Lord of lords, King of kings supreme Monarke,
This is his Name, his title style and mark.
This holy lamb crowned, with gloir and might,
With great triumph, ascended to the hight, Psalm. 9^.

Where as the cloud right rich, and radious
Of his splendor: with Angels gracious,
On knees they kneled, and sweitlie him adored,
Welcome o lamb, ye which has death deuor^d, Deb. 1.

Saying to gidder, with admiratione,

Welcome said they, o lamb celestial,

And fred thy folk, for the of that ugly steid,

Welcome, o lamb, that band with chain insect, Apoc. ^*

O Sons of Adam, be ye glaid and sing,

Give all honor only: to Christ Ieseu.
And sing how that all loving lait and air,
Parteines to him, for now and ever mair.
Rejoice foutane, and forest amiable,

Rejoice feildes sloodes, and crystal springes:
Rejoice beasts, and all kume foul that singes,
Before ye were polluted one and all,
And now ye are delivered out of thrall.
Now all to gidder, laud the lamb in ane,
In eccon langage loud sing and say Amen.
O heavens, we did se and considder:
When ye persauit, the lamb and death to gidder, Met. 17

Then were ye all, over spread and cled with sable, Luc. 23.

With double doole, and tears lamentable.
The Sun in habit, obscure did cleith him sell,
And did his crystal beams, bright, expel.
When Titan saw, that death had power sick,

Then for to weip, ye had occasion:
But now since that the Lord, and King of Sione.

Siti and, on Gods right and holy hand.
Therefore be glaid: and louinges him prepair,
For now that lamb, may suffered death no mair.
Resaue agane, your color christalline, Psalm. 68.

For now the Sun, and lamp of light divine,
That beres more strength, nor Phoebus did before,
Is come to you: and shall you new decore,
Though he be cled, with flesh and blood humane, Mat. 3.

He is the Son of God, and souerane. Esa. 43.

Holding these faithful purpose singuleirs,
Among the regious, planeites and the speirs.
The lamb commanded, then in special,
That throw the whole world universal,
His herroldes should proclaim, to every natione,
The glaide tydinges, of the worldles saluatione. Romans ^.

Syn suddanlie, the cloud preordinat,
With fyres of joy, full fair illuminat,
Covered the lamb, with beams christalline,
So he ascended, by his might divine. Act 3.

Where as Phoebus, kneiled with golden face,
And to his God, right reverently made place.
Saying (o maker) I am right far eshamed,

With paill color to hyde my beams bright,
Absenting often, my seruent force, and might.
But now is come the time, where faith and grace,
Shall all such errors, with their fellows chase. Ephesians. ^, ^*

Therefore with mirth: I take my cope saconde,
To hang, my golden palice rubiconde.

Kings of the earth, and Emperors I say,

But my trwe word, shall evermore endure. Psalm. 1^2 Heb. 1.

One word thereof, nor jot shall never faill,
Till every thing, completed be and haill:
Though Babilone, many regio^s drew them till,
And conquest, to that migthie ^euer Nill, The first Impire.

Where then succeeded, to the Impire secound:
Cyrus whose crown, and scepter high decored, (...).

In Asia, for long time was adored. Macedone peirs and Syrie.

Syne after them, came the breue seignorie,
Of Macedone, where Peirs and Cyrie:
To be masters, had so great affectione,

Thinking to lytill, their rowmes and their rent,
Unto their bounds, sone they did agment

The great ^ictie, superbe and glorious,

Which wan and conquest, all the Orient,
And in short space, subdewed all the Occident.
On such an wise, all lands and langage:
Become their subjects, and made them homage.
Carthai^e, ancient, strong and mighty town,
They brack the walls, and kest the cietie down.
Their gloir, did so increase and multiply,
Pride promest, it should still remane on hie. Pry^ ^.

But when approached, their propre hour and time,
Presixt, and set, by providence deuyne,
From their impire, they were ouerthrawn and cast,
They might no longar reign, for time was past.
So took an end, the high Impire Roman,
That was so long, fordged on blood humane.
The whole world, could not by their great puissance,

Sewe in their sinnat, civil seditione,
Which sprang and grew, to their confusione.

Since in my body, that thou have elect,
Has been accomplished whole obedience, Apoc. ^. Hebr. 2, 9, 10, 12. 2. Cor.

Therefore I pray the, with de^full reverence.
The inobedience, of the world remitte,
That they against the, daily do commit.
Though poysone entered, in by Adames race,
Thou may remead it, with thy might and grace.
For my goodness, and love mende that misdead, Romans 5.

Since that by Adam, entered sin and dead.
Grant throw my death, which was superlatyne,
May enter peace, and everlasting live.

Since thou have pleised, the oblatione,
That piety, has caused me to present: Ioh. 15.

Of my own natural, body innocent,
That sin nor death, pretend no action, Heb. 10.

Must cause the, likewise them to love so weill:
That in their hearts, they may pers^ne and feill, Ioh. 1^.

How for my sake, thou have them all resaued,
As thy own children, Gotten and consaued.
When they by waiknes, in temptatione fall, 1. Cor. 10

O Father then, have mercy on them all.
Considder of themselves, they have no good,
But imperfite, and borne of flesh and blood. Ioh. 14, and 16.

Without our help, they fall and may not stand,
To thy goodness, them all I recommand.
I know full well, what may to them betyde,
So Satan me assailled, with his pride
Thus may I not, always in their vexatione, Mat. 4.

They are my blood, elect and brethren deir.

I may not suffer, that one of them be shent,
To ansuer for them all, I me present,
By thy bontie eternal, they are thine, 1. Cor. 3. Mat. 21. Ioh. 16, 17.

Yet by reasone I boght them, they are mine.
Thou have them put, under my governance:
And promesed me, to be their assurance.

And that it still remain, my heart withinne,
Whil thou this spirit take, from this corpse of sin,
Then thy right way, shall I parsaue and find: Romans 7.

And walk no more, stumbling as I were blind.
To understand that word, shall give me plane, Deuteronomy. 4.

If I with mekenes do it humbly reid,
What is the trwe meat, of an Christian?
Allanerlie since no man leaves on breid,
But by the word: which does of God proceid, Mat. 4.

Lord thou art high brade, lenth and latitude,
Stloth serene, the pure and plesand slude.
I come to the, to weshe me in that place,
Thou knows well, I am the blind man borne,
Refuse me not, but grant me of thy grace,
Since for my sake thou beatten was and torn, Ioh. 9.

Suffer me not, o Lord, to be forlorn,
Nor led with blind, though I blindness desire,
To go and trampe, in every dub and mire.
Oppen my inward eyne, and give me sight,
O Lord, and make me one of thy appointed, ^. Ioh* 2, and 4. Ephe. 2. Heb. 2, 9
and 10.

That I may judge, the darkness by the light:
And say that it is Jesus, Gods oynted,
That with his precious* blood has me anointed.
And me redeemed has from captivity:
And has me given the Spirit of liberty.
The (...) for the of (...) chase,
With (...)^ and (...)
That I (...) and it (...) Esa. 15. Luc. 1.

Louse thou (...) that I may (...) expre^,
That holy word, and daily it confess.
Sen th^^ have said, let not my yocke the grieve, (...) ^*

For if thou will, ^^my promise believe.
Thou shall dwell in me, and I in the remane,
If thou bide constant, withoutten balt or hink
To comfort the, in thy travel and pane,
In thy drouthe, thou shall have my blood to drink, Ioh. 6.

And in thy heart, if that trwe faith can sink,
My body thou shall have, and flesh to ^it:
To feed the inward man, the life and spreit.
Remembering thereby, my death and passione,
Until I come, keep the same in memory, 1. Cor. 11

For they receive their ownr damnatione,
That eattes this Sacrament, unworthily,
Making no difference, of the Lords body,
Therefore let one man judge him self and s^ne,
Let him come ^at the bread, and drink the wine. 2. Cor. ^^

Right many are with maladi^s confused,
And do perish^ at length, without remeid,
Because they have* (...) Sa^^a^^^t abused: 1. (...) 11.

And many slepes, to the (...)
Because, they have not thereof taken he^d:
Lord ^locken me, with drink celestial.
That no dregs, nor poysone papisticall.
Have puissance, to enter my heart withinne,
Whose dregs has done, ye whole world delude,
Which is but draffe, and satlinges full of sin: Ioh. 6.

The Lords word and promise, is my fude,
He has me fed, in faith with flesh and blude.
He is the bread of life, the which shall give,
Pardon of sin, to all that will believe.
He is the Sacrament: and lamb Paschall,
That oues for all, has made ane offering: Leuit. 18 Deu^. 21. Psalm. 4^ Heb. 1.
Gal. 3.

His precious blood, has ransoued us all,
He was for us cursed: and on an ecoce did hing:
That curse till us, he chainged in blessing.
And to save his elect, for very love,
He gave him self, to death for their behoue.
And from the dead* to life he roise again,
In to his natural body sensible, Ioh. 21.

Syne to his Apostles appeared plain, Mar. 16.

That they might all see, his body visible,
Syne to his Father, that is invisible,
He ascended from them, though they did murne: Act. 1.

And promest, at the last day for to return.
In that same body, that he rose from deid,
Which body, does remane in heaven always,
And sits on Godds right hand, as says ye creid, Heb. 1^*

And shall not steir, nor move, as Paull does say,
Whill the last trompet sound, at domesdaye,
If it so be, flesh nor eye corruptable?
May not himse, which is vncorruptable.
Nor yet their is no mouth, nor hand mortal
Nor yt marchantes, thereof thought they be wraith,
May ^at or touch^ his body natural,
But all the faithful, as the Scripture says,
Do ^at his ^l^she, and drink his blood in faith,
And till he come, has left that ordinance:
In s^gne of his death, and our deliverance.
As for the obla^ion^, and sacrifice* Malac. 1.

Offered by Cha^nons, Mo^ckes, Priests: and Freris,
For quick, and dead, founded on avarice, ^see. 5.

Their Sacrifice, in Godd^s sight apperis,
As clothe polluted, cum menstruo mul^eris.
W^o will not couf^ss^* all ready that Christ:
Is come in flesh he is, ane A^techrist. ^. Ioh. 4

They deny Christ, those falls Prophets profane,
S^ice he is come, both d^ad and buried, Heb. 9.

That will h^n newlinges, slay and kill agane, ^al. 2.

The Sacrifice of the old Law pacified:
The father, whill his Son was sacrified. ^om. ^.

Which is come, and off^^d ons for all, ^^b. 10.

But ^^^ce that he is com^, as says samet Paull:
And for our sins, has su^^red passione,
S^ing that he, is rissin and gloufied, Idem.

The father, will no n^we oblatione.
He will be no^ adored, and ma^nifie^
Christ will no more, for ^innes b^ sacrified,
He will now be lou^d feared s^rued and dred:
And will no more, with Sacrifice be fed.
It is only thou, o Jesus Christ my Lord,
It is thou, o sweit Lamb immaculat, 1. Ioh. 2.

I pray the Lord, to be misericord: 1. Tim. 2

And though, that I should be vituperat,
Of all my freindes, and excommunicat: ^oh. 16. Romans 7.

Scorged, scorned: imprisoned and blamed,
Yet of thy word shall I not be eschamed.
But I shall boldly say, in every steid,
And confess before men, both morn and even, Act. 4.

That their is none other, can give remeid,
Nor yet none other name, in earth nor heaven: Luc. 20.

That for saluatione, is to mankind given, 1. Pet. 2.

Nor grace, nor life, that can till us inswe,
But only, in the name of Christ Ieswe. Act. 4.

And yet til al them, that his word does mock,
And daily do, their own traditiones houlde Mat. 21.

To all that would enter, in his sheep foulde,
By an other way, nor him self has toulde, Ioh. 10.

To them that s^kes, by inventions subtiles: Esa. ^8.

To save them, by their works inutiles.
Ye that your own good, intentes estemes, Idem.

To seek the word of God, that is so sweir,
Arise and walk, forth of your sliprie dremes,
In sleep ye are charged, and may not steir, Ephesians. 5

With heavy burdinges, impossible to beir: Mat. 23.

An thousand things, againes ye truth God wat,
A walk, ^orthe of your ^ilthie dr^ames uifames,
And use the counsel, of the Apostle James:
^ho that has fault, of sapi^nce says he, ^acob. 1.

Let ask of God, which gives aboundantke.
To every man, and does none decea^e,
Nor yet no kind of natione, will he lack, ^oh. 10.

What thing ye ask in faith ye shall it have,
Come all that will repent, and be not slak, Mat. 9.

That he may take the burdinges of your back:
He is our Lord, our Savior and Master,
He makes the wound, syne sets on the plaster*
At his own pleasure, and not at our will,
None of us, are found just, before his face, Romans ^.

Our own nature, can wirke no good but ill
If we have goodness, it is not of our race: Ephe. ^.

Nor yet of our selves, but by Gods grace,
By his grace, I which was an olive wild:
Is grafted in faith, and become his child. Romans 11.

Participant of the free olive fair,
Where I was before, bastard and none other, Idem.

He ha^he me made, his lauchfull son and air:
And ^ik partaker, with my eld^st brother, Luc. 15.

And come last to laubour, in the wine,
Yet with the first, I gat my just propyne. Mat. 2^.

For that ungodly beast, is no renieid,
Is he not chief? of his unknown kirk: 1. Ioh. ^^

Saint John in his epistle, bids me take heid,
Their is says he, an certain sin to deid,
For the which sin I wish no man to pray:
The beast commits ye sin, both night and day.
I meine the sin, against the holy ^pr^it, Heb. 6, and 10.

With that sin no man ought to play nor bound,
To pray for Gods ^oo, it is not meit,

But to set all idolatry aside:
As thou may planelie read, in the commandes: Exodus 20

And use no more, the folly of your brave:
As is written, in Deuteronomium,
If the wicked in vice, will still remane:

Against all them, that darre him vilipend.

It is well known, how ye have done misgide, Iere 32.

What through your ignorance, and what through ire,
The blind world, that in you does conside, Ezec. 34* Z^ch. 10.

For all is but blindness, that ye require:
Who sekes the light, ye do them burn with fire,
What? for the flesh the matter is but small, M^t. 20.

Ye have no puissance, over the Spirit nor saull.
The (...) of ^^k one, ye do oppress,
That ^or the Gospelles sake is dreuen to deid:
To Gods glory* one thousand does incress^,
Gamaliell in the Acts ye may reid, Act. 5.

Gave you wise counsel, if you would take held:
When that they preached, at Jerusalem,
Saying, if that their doctrine be of men.
Their doctrine can not last, I you assure,
But in short time, shall vanishe as an bourd:
And if it be of God, It shall endure, Iden.

The Apostles doctrine was Gods wourd,
But your doctrine, is fagott fire and swourd:
For till distroy, and put all to confutione, Iere. 10.

Who will not draw, the yock of your abusione.
Though ye us persecut, withoutten piety, Mat. 10.

Yet Jesus Christ, has by his providence:
Commanded us to sly, from town to c^^ti^

Before all them that have, the lantern cleir.
Of Gods word, how ye wild asses rude,
With wholesome heirbes, yt n^^er was acqu^nted, Esa. ^2.

Of the good s^ock, of Gods own anointed:
Whill the time be run, that is appointed,
O holy Spirit, p^yssant consolatore: Ioh. 14.

Come, be governor and cike translatore:
Of the poor world, that leueth in ignorance, Deuteronomy. 1^

And is only, on their own minds mused: Esa. 6.

That ignorance, be not there esperance,
Though they have been, these many years co^^used, Mar. 6.

And with sals doctrine, this long time abused:
Yet let thy electione, alway^ ^btene, Psalm. 6.

That which thy justice, may no way preuene. Romans 11.

And rather make it, to all nationes plane,
That they may know, their blindness and arrise: Psalm. 60. 1* Cor. 1, and ^.

How worldly wit, and wisdom is but vane,
Sen God has said, the poor that ye dispryse,
Yet shall their foolishnes, confound the wise,
Not with highness, nor gloir as writes Paull,
Nor with no or^at speech rhetorical.
But in the puissance, of Christ crucified, Idem.

And not by man's wit: nor his prudence,
For man's wisdom, has not us purisied:
Sain^t Paull preched, none other sapience,
But the high mysteries, of Gods prescience,
Unknown to pr^lattes, that for avarice: Gal. 3.

Of gold or silver, gifts or benefice:
Would the ignorant world, to them draw, Malach. 2, and 3.

And does thereof, the whole riches posseid,
And with that strength, defendes their rite and law,
They will over princes reign, in every steid,
And will not to the word of Paull take held, Phil. 3.

Saying, in compair of the word divine:
I do esteem the rest, but filthe and slime.
I have not whereof, to boist I grant,
But of the many stripes, that I have wonn* ^al. 6.

O God forbid, that I my self do vant
But in Christ's croce, as first I have begone,
To preach his word, whil that my glass be gonne
I have no gloir, nor none I will me take,
But where as I have thoild for Christ's sake.
Who that is persecute, for Christ's Loy^,
God, that the hearts of the faithful tryes, Man. 10.

Shall their persute, turn till eternal joy:
For who will be (says Paul) discreit or wise
Must at all time, their own wisdom dispryse.
Praying to God, cont^nuall all and some: 1. Cor. 3.

That they may fools and idiottes become.
For worldly wisdom, will never be content,
Nor never will, the flesh persuade nor tiste: Mat. 16.

To thoill the earthly woe, and pains present,
To them that trweli^ hes made, an faithful triste, 1. Ioh. 2.

To walk after the will: of Jesus Christ,
For they must, or they enter in the gloir, ^. Tim. 3 Man. 10.

Pas through that pathe, their master past befoir.
Paull writand, as the holy Spirit him taught,
Of the divine nature supernatural,
Unto the Romans in the theptour aught,
How God the Father, from the original, (...) ^.

Has knawne the faithful: and elect them all,
To be like the form, and image ever mair:
Of Jesus Christ, the Son of God preclair.
Faithful Christians, what demand ye more,
Since God has given to you such conforting: 1. Ioh. 3.

Is their more gre^ter honor, land and gloir:
As to be portrait, in every kind of thing,
To Jesus Christ, the Son of God our King, Col. 3.

At the last day, with Christ our Master deir,
Like to him self (says John) we shall appeir.
Christ says, who that would my disciple be,
Forsake him self, againes the world strive: Luc. 9.

Take up my croce, and beir it after me,
I grant there is no creature, on live,
But they would all be saved, man and wife, Mat. 10.

I confess, all would reign with Christ in blis
But sewe are like, the Son of God in this.
The Son of God, our Master or he rang,
Received humility, and abhorred pride: Mat. 2. Luc. 22.

Was crucified, and tholed pains strange,
And durst not long, in to no place abide,
Baneist, and had no hole, his heid to hide: Ioh. 8.

He was blasphemed, they said say we not weill,
Away Samaritane possessed with the deill.
For who would be like, the Son of God,
Like him must shape, their cleathing and their weid, Col. 3.

Syne bear his croce, through every pathe and rod: Mat. 16.

If we would reign, vncrucified in deid,
We are not like to Christ, our cheffe and heid, Mar. 8.

God haith ordained, all that with Christ shall ring: Luc. 9.

For to be like to Christ, in every thing.
Their is no way, to enter in to gloir, Romans ^.

Their is no help, their is none other choice: ^uc. 9.

But as the Son of God, has gone be^oir,
He is the way, his sheep they hear his voise, Ioh. 10.

They follow him, thy bear his mark and croise: Esa. 50.

God the Father, in his counsel divine,
Determined, by suff^ing woo and pine:
That Jesus Christ, should enter in repose,
Since the divinity, did so decreit, Esa. 62.

So it behooved, this blessed heavenly rose:
Should suffer death, to make the work co^pleit,
As God the Father, had ordained in Spreit,
Some says yt the Scripture: and Prophettes trwe, Luc. 9.

Spoke and meined, but only of Christ Jesus.
I answer, the providence eternal, Ephesians. 1.

Before the world, as now it sees and saw,
Comprehending, all things universal: 1. Cor. 11.

The cermonicall, Scriptures ye know, Col. 1.

Are finished in Christ, end of the Law.
But yet the Scriptures, follow upon us: Romans 8.

That are members of his Son Christ Jesus.
The holy Spirit (of God) says Paull express,
That wirketh day and night, for our behoue,
To our spirit, bears record and witness,
That we are children, of the Lord above,
Also coheritoures, with Christ throw love,
(Says Paull) if we suffer with him in deid:
We shall be also, with him glorifeid.
Except we suffer, and our selves dant,
The holy Spirit, makes narratione, Mat. 20.

We shall no ways, be participant, Mar. 10.

Of Jesus Christ's death, and passione.
Except we bear, the croce of tribulatione, 2. Tim. 2

If we think shame, his croce to bear and take:
Likewise says Paull, he will us clean forsake.
In to the Leuitt Law, God gave command, Leuit. 2.

To all Israel, that they should never tire,
To salt all sacrifice, and all offrand,
But in the nynt of mark, Christ does require,
His seruandes, to be seasoned with fire, Mar. 9.

If they will be, of his religione:
To salt them selves, with persecutione.
Prepair you, o vnfeinzeid Christians,
To pass, se that ye be all ready dressed, 1. Cor. 3.

This purgatore, to the Corrinthians,
That Paull in to, the third theptour expressed,
Where every work, shall be manifest,
In the day of temptatione, and of ire:
The croce of tribula^ione, is that fire.
That fire shall try, our work ^s even and od, Id^m.

To rich nor poor, it will have no respect,
Their shall be seen, who is like ye Son of God, Ioh. 16.

It is neidefull, that all the faithful Sect, 2. Tim. 3

Be tried by fire, that are his trwe el^ct:
As were all they, that loved Christ's Impyre: Iud. 8.

Proved and tried, by that fellone fire.
Abell the just, by his own brother Cain, Genesis 4, and 7.

Though he offended him, in to no caice,
Was he not put to death, by him and slain?
Noye with all kind of souls, and beasts raice,
Was closed on the sea, an years spaice,
Abraham, father of all fidelity, Romans 4.

Had he not daily, great adversity?
When sundry times, for dreddour of his life, Genesis 12, 14, 20, 22 and 23.

For hongare, famine, and tribulatione,
Behooved to deny, his propre wise,
Loath in Sodom, had great v^xatione,
Isaac, had he not great temptatione?
When his father, obeying Goddes' command,
Upon an altar, like one lamb him band,
To cut his neck, all ready was an knyfe,
Whill that his father, persaued well and saw,
That Gods Angel, came to save his life,
Twenty years, durst not Jacob, ye know, Genesis 27. and 17.

Come to Canaan, for feir of Esaw,
Iosephes own brethren, put him in an cave:
And syne him sold, in Egypt for an slave.
Where his masters, accused him in dispite,
And into prisone impetiouslie was done, Genesis 39.

For not fulfilling: of her appetite,
Moses walde rather, with Godds people wo^ne, Exodus 12

Nor to be called, king Pharoes daughters son. Heb. 11.

Nor with the glorious, both night and day, Prouer. 16.

O word divine, o outward man well danted,
O faith and hope, in till an heart well hanted.
When Samuel, by prophecy divine:
Declared till Eli, his great ruin.

If thou have past, this fire in double sort.
What shall I say, what Prophet now let see?
What righteous man, that to the truth is given?
Has shawn the word of God, and scapit free,
In the acts, for witness I take sainet Steven, Act. 7.

Saying these words, in the cheptour seven,
Which of the Prophettes, that ye in writ of reid?
Has not your Fathers persecute till d^id.
Like as they did, none of the Prophets spair,
But for to slay them, thought it sport and bourde, M^t. 4* (...) 17.

So did they John, that Prophet was and mait,
Even as the eunemies, of Gods holy wourd,
From the beginning, with knife fire and swourd,
As they his seruandes used, with death and Rod:
So have they done, the very Son of God. 1. T^s. ^.

Thus if we start, for punishment untrue: Mat. 10.

From death to life, he rose on the third day,
Ascended to the heaven, where he always.

The Pellicane ^iguring Jesus Christ.
THe Pellicane, of the forest celest,
Among his works, notable and new,
After the heaven, the Angels, and the rest.
He made his birds, of diverse sindrie hew.
Allone them left, and sine away he flewe,
And gave them, their ^rewill and liberty,
In to the forest of Parradice to be.
Where that the tree of life, it grew and stude,
Set by the Pellicane, of humility.
To save his birds, that spared not his blud.
But as they sang, sweit and melodious,
Into that wood, as plesand nightingailles,
An fouler false: vgsume and odious.
Their with his nets and girnes soir assailles.
Syne baneist them, the gairdings and the vailles,
Because till over high fruit, they did pretend,
To wilsome vailles and dailles, the^ were they send,
Where they remaned, long in servitude,
Abiding the Pellicane their mis for till amend.
To save his birds, that spared not his blude.
Down from the wood of Angels bright and cleir,
This Pellicane for love, did swiftly fly,
Where he ^and Rawens, did his small birds, deir.
And shed his blood, in streimes ^rwellie.
Withoutten reuth, this Pellicane, they gart die,
Denud of mercy, they did him rug and ryue,
With patience to death, he thoild them drive.
His faltles flesh, because their was no ^ude,
Nor medicicine, could save his birds live.
Whill from his tender heart, they re^t his blud.
The Ravens, at the Jews full of feid,
Unjustly put, this Pellicane to deid.
Which does betoken, Christ both God and man,
The birds, are the creatures humane.
The false fouler, the laithlie serpent rude,
That gart misknow, the heavenly Pellicane.
To save his birds, that spared not his blude.

Ane Ballad of the spiritual: and carnal understanding of Christ's words,
This is my body and blood, etc. John. 6.
ALlone musing, as I forth went,
An suddane sleep, did me assaye,
I thought my spirit, was from me rent:
Upon the ground, where as I lay.
I heard an voice breck forth and say:
Take holy Scripture spiritual,
The letter leads to dekaye,
The flesh profytetes nothing at all.
In the sext of Iohne, Christ does say,
The verray bread, of life am I:
I came from heaven, I am the way,
Mankind to save, throw faith only,
Ye can not come to me trwelie,
Except my father do you call,
I am in him, and he in me:
The flesh profytetes nothing at all.
Your fathers, in the wilderness,
They eat Manna, and yet are deid,
After an other kind expres:
For^uthe I am the leuing breid,
Come down from heaven in to shissteid,
A am the bread celestial
My word throw faith, it does you feid,
The flesh prosfeites nothing at all.
Except ye eat, believe and trow, August. in sermon ad in^uttes.

In my body, and drink my blude,
I say ye have, no life in you,
For my body, is verray fude:
Right so is drink, I you conclude,
My blood, and take it spiritual,
For carnally, no man can dude:
The flesh prosfeites nothing at all.
Except ye eat, ye have no life,
My flesh, and drink my blood he said*
But then among them, grew such strife,
That some went back, and was afraid:
And carnally, his words wraid,
Until their minds sensual:
And from the faith, they still dekaid,
The flesh prosfeites nothing at all.
The Disciples murmurred amang,
Now can this man, his flesh us give,
But Christ knowing, their thoghtes wrang:
Saying, wherefore should this you greiue,
All though the Son of man, should meiue:
To his glory celestial,
The spirit quickneth, throw trwe believe,
The flesh prosfeitz nothing at all.
Sain^t Augustine, writing full plane,
Against Adamant trwelie,
How the Lord douted not to save.
This is my blood, and my body, August. contra Adaman ^im.

When that he gave, to his meinzie:
The sign of his body corporal,
To keep his death in memory:
The flesh prosfeites nothing at all.
Als in an preface, does he say,
Where Christ, did him self admit:
To his mandie on thuresdaye,
Saying, take you, now all and eat:
The holy sigure, of me compleit,
And of my death memorial,
My token trwe and promise sweit,
The flesh prosfeites nothing at all.
This flesh ye se, ye shall not eat*
Nor drinck the blood, shed forth of me,
My Sacrament, is drinck and meat,
That siedes, the inward man trwelie,
Not for thy teith, nor thy belly:
I am no meat material,
Believe and thou hes eatten me,
The flesh prosfeites nothing at all.
Most gracious God illumiu^,
Our wits waik and imp^^ent,
Incresse our says, so satigat:
Make word and deid equivalent,
Our sins vile, for to repent:
And lead our lives more spiritual,
According to thy testament,
Which is the flesh, that profeites all.
An^ Ballade, upon the prayer or orisque of ^^nasses King of Judah, when he was
led presouer^ and captive in Babilone* 2. Cron. 33.
VIth tears great, I sigh and Sob,
Bewaling my nativity,
O God of Abram, and Jacob,
I make my woeful plainte to the:
Bound foot and hand, with an cheinze,
As an slave, mocked and dispist:
In presoue and captivity,
Soulzeit with the vncircumcist.
Thou Lord that made: the heaven on hight,
The earth, with all her instruments,
Thou made also, the day and night,
The Sun, the Monne resplendisentes,
The fire, the air, the elements,
Thy word, o Lord, and thy command:
Has gart the heavenly ornaments,
In till their curse, and ordour stand.
The (...) sea, deep and prosound,
By thy virtue, which d^^th excel,
those welicring walls, su^^bound,
Dare not attoure, their brymmes swell*
Their bodumis furius and fell,
Of whirling waters, stif and stark:
The Lord has closed up himsell,
And sealed them, with his seall and mark
O fearful God, who may withstand,
Thy fervent Ire, in any case
No sinner on the earth leuand:
Thy fury, may abide allace,
for none are just, before thy face,
But all are sinners young and old:
All are denude, and bare of grace,
And to the devil: and hell are sold
I grant thou art, the Lord abone,
Of Jacob, Abram and Isac
that sinned not, as I have done:
Nor thy commandementes brak,
But I sinner, sleuthfull and slack,
For breking thy law: and command,
^es heaped mo sins on my back:
Nor is in nombre, all the sand.
I have provoked thy Ire allace,
My pride and my Iniquite*
^es wroght great ill before thy face:
I know their is no health in me,
I grant I (...),
And wor^h^^ of the (...) and rod:
Because in my (...),
I would not know, the Lord my God.
My great abhominatione,
That day and night has done incres,
Hes been the just occasion,
Of all my woe and heaviness,
I have sinned I do confess:
Right greuouslie aganes the Lord,
Let not my sin and wickedness:
Stop the to be misericord.
Yet thou have in remembrance,
Thy promise, and thy holy aith:
The man, that is of repentance,
To punish him, thou art right laith,
Though thou be angry in thy wraith:
Thou art sone pacified we ken,
When that we call, to the in faith,
For all, the wickedness of me^.
Though we sinners deserve justly,
Dampnatione death and helles fire,
Yet for reward, thy great mercy,
Hes pacified thy wraith and ire:
And promest hes thy high impire,
Frelie, to all that will conuart,
For thou do not of us require:
Except an trwe and faithful heart.
For thy goodness, no more considder,
My silthie sins, night nor day,
But wipe them, all away to gidder:
Since that I do, repent and pray,
I know thou castes not away,
No wight that will on the depend,
Nor willis nor their death no way:
But would that they should leave and mend.
With knees of my heart contreit,
I kneill full law, before thy grace.
With tears distilling, that I greit,
I weshe my bailfull blaickned face,
O Good Lord, hear me in this caice,
And grant me my petitione:
And for my sins, not me chaice,
But gif me full remissione.
Now save me Lord, since that I pray,
Save me, o God, omnipotent:
And I shall loif the, night and day,
Wh^ll that my life, away be spent:
For all the virtues parmanent,
Of heaven, the Angels all and some:
They praise the, as most excellent,
In world of worldles for to come.
An Ballade, against the foull and d^t^stable vice of dron^kinnesse.

Shaikand his beird, with asteirne voice did say
Of all sins ^xcesse, is principal:
And bringes the body sonest to dekaye, Pro. 31.

Throw droncknes, the mother of vices all.
I was the first, that wine did plant or press,
Thinking to be, his master and his gyde,
But he deceived me, I the confess: Genesis 9.

And of my Son, was scorned in that tide,
Because I could not, my own secreittes hyde,
I cursed Cham my son, and made him thrall:
Till his two brethren, seruand till abide,
Throw droncknes, the mother of vices all.
What though I was be gild, it was no woder,
I had no counsel, nor experience: Ecle. 31.

But thou have red, of many skoir and hunder,
That vine hes brought till inconvenience:
Thou can not the excuse, of ignorance,
Thou knows their beastly end, and brutall fall,
And yet thou follows still, the same offense:
Of droncknes, the root of vices all.
I planted wine, for recreatione,
Of man's heart and not him to confuse,
To drink at times, with moderatione, Ephe. 5.

The wine is good, and not for to refuse:
But not as some, hes surfetlie done use,
Away to waught, their wits natural:
And with the wine their brains till abuse,
Throw droncknes, the mother of vices all.
Though wine in cupe, with color christalline*
Appear right cleir, with taist melluf^^ent,
Syne pleasa^dlie, down to thy breist incline, Pro^. 2^.

I counsel the, bewar and take good tent:
His stong is worse, nor eddir or serpent,
And chaisses forth, thy secreittes cordial,
Where wine bears reull, all reason is absent,
Throw droncknes, the root of vices all.
The wine, did Lot on such an way molest,
That with his daughters twane to him unknown
With child them gat, and did commit incest,
Throw beast lines, he did abuse his own, Genesis 1^

And of that wicked se^d, the which was sown,
Sprang up an people diabolical,
The Moabittes, and the Ammonites thrown,
Throw droncknes, the ground of vices all.
The mighty King of Assyrie Banadab:
Came in battaill with two and threttie Kings
Accontrare Israel, and als the king Achab
But two hundredth and threttie Underlings:
O^ Israel their seruandes, and their dringes,
Assailzeit them, in their exces brutall:
Overcame them all, and wan their great britin
In droncknes, the nouris of vices all.
E^ath sometime great King of Israel:
By ^ambry his seruand, thou may reid,
The king overcome with wine that tratour fell:
His master slew* syne he rang in his steid, 1. Samuel. 13.

Ammon king Dauidis son, of royal seid,
At one shepeshearing bancket estuall:
By Absolon his brother was brought till deid,
In droncknes, the mother of vices all:
Of all vices, yt vice is till abhore:
So might say Holifernus lieutenand,
To the awful king. Nabuchodonosore, Iud^. 13.

After his great conquestes in every land:
Such pleasure on an time in wine he fand,
That Judith in his tent, with power small,
Struck of his heid and left him still bledand:
In droncknes the mother of vices all.
Right as an roustie canker; will not blin: ^. Cor. 6.

Whill it consume the steill, all round about,
So does exces, an dronckard dig within,
And delwes all reasone, clean forth of his snout:
So when this cankre, yt steill has eattin out,
The roust is ready, to flite chide and to brall,
Then will he feght though he be nothing stout:
In droncknes the mother of vices all.
Exces is regent, of the sins sewen: 1. Cor. 6.

She is the poole, wherein they row and fleit,
No dronckard, shall have portioune in ye heaven, Ephe. 5.

But perish shall, with belly indiscreit:
Thou should be rather, filled with the spreit, Gall. 5.

Vsand the doctrine, of the postle paull:
Leif sobirlie, vpone thy brows sweit,
For droncknes is mother of vices all.
Stories humane, I could an thousand shaw,
To what effect, for why we have a new?
Of exemples in Gods word and law,
The which are just, and faithful stories true: 1. Cor. 6.

Into the testamentes twane boith old and new,
To shaw to the whole world universal:
The great mischief, that daily does insew,
Through droncknes, the mother of vices all.
Saying these words, then he approached narre:
I grant thy youth, hes had sompart of wite,
But thou art happy, if thou can be war,
And leif that foull, and beastly appetite:
In times past, where thou was imperfite,
For penance thou shall have perpetual,
First to forbeir, and syne always to write.
Aganes droncknes, the mother of vices all.
As I awoik, he lap away full light
For werray fear, I fell in such an trance,
That all the hears of my heid stude up right,
When I overcome, syne had remembrance:
How Noye, had me iniuned such penance:
Streght way for ink and paper did I call,
And wrait this ryme, denude of eloquence,
Aganes droncknes, the mother of vices all.
Who maid this sang, for suith I shall you tell:
Sometime an brother of Bacchus beastly band,
^f ye would know, my name is Noruell,
That served bacchus boith by sea and land:
Whill in his service, so litill fruit I fand,
That now I am becom^, his foo mortal,
And shall gar abstnence bind boith foot and hand
Of droncken bacchus, the father of vices all.
Finis
How death does answer maike and send: to them that do him vilipend.
Translated forth of frainshe, by the said Noruell.
BLindit people, fallin in fantaseis,
Seduced ^drouned, in doctrines humane,
Why make ye me, such pomp and obsiqueis?
Since yt your mouths, still exicrattes my name.
Ye curse and wary when I your freindes clame:
But when it confines, the diriges to sing,
The pridfull papists, they do me nothing blame,
Cause gold and money, to them I do inbring.
So by this manner, my pompes ordinair,
Amendeth moir, the leuing nor the deid,
For painted tombs, torches doole nor cair,
They can not clenge, the soull, nor help at neid:
Their is but Christ's blood, can make remeid,
By lively faith, which purges man and wife,
And yet but me. whom ye bear still at feid:
Ye can not enter, intil Eternal life.
Though I be ugly, vile and vndesyred:
Yet am I ordained, by God celestial,
And of the faithful, rather is required,
Nor this inconstant life, terrestrial:
Appering sweit, is more bitter then gall,
The longer life, the mo thy sins esteem,
It is for lack, of knowledge spiritual:
Since I the love, that does me thus blaspheme.
How shall I lufe the, thou loves not thy sell:
That would always, into this world be seen,
And from the gloir, so long thy self expel,
That Gods word, hes promest fair and clean,
Though thou posses the earth, and sea screne:
Beauty, wit, strength, and rest wout mischief,
Trusting the second life, for till obtain:
Thou would me wyshe, if thou did so belief.
The postle Paull: and prophettes cheritable,
Augustine Ambros, and many holy wight,
Whose lives to Gods word, was agreeable:
They thrusted after me, both day and night,
Although thy flesh, do strive aganst my might,
Yet for the love, of thy Father celest
I shall the show, how thou shall follow right,
Them that my dart, did never yet molest.
Pray God only, of his grace the to give,
That lively faith, that Paull has preched true,
Thy life syne after theme, confirm and leave:
Do de ligence, the outward man subdew,
Syne glaidlie die, to leave with Christ Iesw
Where thou shall regne, with him in joy content:
So this faith, shall the inward man renew,
Although thy flesh theirto, will not consent.

And is but an obscure, or law preson,
Where as in laugour, lies the soul gentill:
Of that prison, I have key subtle,
Which is my dart, that for the soul is given,
To louse it out, of that soull preson vile
Where I it send, with mekle joy to heaven.
Hold f^irme thy faith, on an God vndefild,
And for thy father take him, and him call:
Is he be so, then art thou sure his child, Mat. 6.

And air of his kingdom Celestial,
If he has fred the, from death perpetual:
Befoir or ever, thou had till him regaird, Romans 5.

Dout not, but and thou love him cordial,
With mekell better, he shall thy self rewaird.
And as concerning, the fleshes action:
It can not live, without sin and delight,
Nor yet, it can not make satisfactione, Romans 6.

For sin to God, whereof it had the wit:
But right as Jesus, upon an croce perfect;
Died for our sins, so most our flesh expire,
And die with Christ, if that we would be quyte:
Of endless death sin, and of Hellis fire.
Who strikes this stroke, but death thou know weill
So I am to all christians, man and wife:
The end of sin, beginning of their seill,
The end of cair and thought, most pungetyfe,
And the beginning, of everlasting life:
Why would thou Aig^: return to youth again,
To pas the vaill, of woo and mortal strife,
Which thou have escaped, with so mekell pain.
If thou will say. when I come the arreist:
That I the do great wrong, and violence,
Saying thou have no pain, but joy and f^ist,
With all delight, withoutten indigence,
I say that pleasure, turns to impatience:
When it at length, leads to dampnatione,
My death is pleasure, to all has sapience,
When ye from death, turn to salvation.
What displeasure: have I here to the named,
To fear my dart, nay nay (I say) not so:
But for Christis sake, to suffer and be blamed,
To take in patience, truble pain and woe,
The loss of goods: and dignities also,
Wanting pleasurs, that sometime thou had ryfe:
So dyeng under my dart, to pas them fio.
In place of them, shall have Eternal life
For fear of me, be not contrist nor woe:
But have firm hope, and faith for till conform,
The will of God, and syne let gladly go,
Riches and friends, with all thesaures enorme,
For an cleir sky, betoknes that the storm:,
Will sone throw the Air, make seperatione
Such faith in persons, departing does perform
Sure signs and tokens, of their true saluatio^e.
To this effect, thou should not fear at length:
Jesus for us, would first the death assay,
His death has venquest, (...) might and strength
Theirfore think not to dye, though I ye slay:
He me overcame, to s^ue the from d^^ay,
So I am but port: and passage manifest,
That thou should gladly ^ine, throw night and day.
From this false world,, to heavenly gloir celest:
Sometime in figure, as Scripture declair can
An brasin serpent, Moses did raise on hight,
Which serpent to behold, did heall an man:
That had been stonged, by ^yrie serpents slight,
Likewise all they, that by trwe faith hes sight,
Of Christ is death, is heiled of my band,
As of the secound death, I have no might,
Christ has that pouer, rest forth of my hand.
Great folly is, in the custom humane:
To mourn for men, when I them lay on sleip,
If thou beleues, he shall with God remane,
W^y do thou then, lament with sighing deep:
Orwould thou here, always on life him keep,
Will thou him from his great profit defend:
Since it is Gods will, thou should not weep,
In doing so, I know thou do offend.
Let pagains rore, let turks take terrors,
That hope to have, none other habitatione:
The lake of faith, is cause of all theare Errors,
Like Eath^^qu^s ignorant, of their saluatione,
As to the black doo^es frequentation,
Ipocricie did shaipe, that feyned sorrow,
Some for their father makes dooll ad deploratione
That for their mother, would it, weire the morrow
Messess of Requ^^^, (...) excellis:
To the great profit of (...) and (...)
With rou^ing roaring, and (...) of bellis,
Their gredines forth shows their wicked wa^^*
For if ye had no vailzeand to your ^^kes,
Be ye assured, that after your deceirs,
None of the rabill, that wearres the marks:
Will for you ringe, or singe or say an veirs.
For the prepair, no such solemniteis,
Nor for thy burial, b^ thou no ways trist:
In Gods sight, they are but vaniteis,
Sauitie, does not in earth nor tomb consist
An Faithful man, shall in the heaven be blist
Where ever his flesh or body buried be,
The wickits soull, shall in the hell ^e thrist:
Though he were buried, whith all solemnity.
At short to end, now with my first purpose:
Fear not me death, nor ban me I the pray,
For who would in the heavenly House repose.
Must first believe, gods promese I say:
Vho would be with his angels, night and day
Vho would the face of God, behold and se:
And who would dwell in paradise for aye.
Yet before all I death must gar him die.
Confess me to be good and gracious,
For whill I come: thou art with sin repleit,
Confess thy life bitter and Eigerous:
Confess my dart, plesand wholesome and sweit,
Also confess and grant although thy spreit.
Ware mortal, as thy filthy (...) immound:
Yet should thou hold me as thy freiud discrte,
That (...) the, from their wor^^li^ (...) pro ^ound
FINIS
Where follows The Judgment of Minos. Upon the preserment of Alexander the
great Conquerout. Hanniball of Carthage, and Scipion the Romain, surnamed
Affrican. (...) forth of Fray^ce in sco^tes by the said Noruell.
My vaileant heart, full of honor and gloire
May not suffer Ha^niball to pas before
Me, intill arms and deeds martial:
For suthe I think no man yt is equal,
Ought in deeds of arms, for to compair:
There worthynes or actis unto mine.

Hanniball. I will defend, and manteyne the contrair,
Reporting me, until God Mynos syne:
Judge infernal, and Lord of woe and pyite,
The aufull sword of justice, to mantyne:
Where right and reason always shall be seyne,
For every man alike both friend and sone,

Mynos. That I may hear first, tell to me anon,
What are ye that disputis, hear alone?
Of high honors, to have the advantage.

Alexandre. This is the Duke Hanniball, of Carthag^,
And I Alexandre the great Empriour,
Of all the world King and Conqueror,
That wan, and s^bdwed every Natione.

Mynos. Your names are of great existunatione,
Worthy of honor, glory and land supreyme:
With lawreir crowned is your diadeyme,
I meruell ye should, have debaite togidder*

Alexandre. Bot Mynos I think ye should consider.
My birth for^u^^, silicitie and werde,
And how I would, suffer no man in erde:
To be my compagnion, nor perregall,
But as the Eigle, that suremountis all.
Other fowls, most highest in the air,
So may no man, himself to me compaire:
In high curage, and furour bellicall:
Wherefore I will not, that this Hanniball,
Compair him self to me, in were or peace

Mynos. It is convenient, an of you seife:
Whill the other, have layser and season,
In my presence, to declair his reasone.

Hanniball. O Mynos, forsuthe, I hold the worthy,
Of high renoune, of honor land and glory:
That is of law degree, and small puyssence,
Syne by there virtue, and there excellence.
To conques, honor and name victorious,
In deeds of arms laborious.
As I have done, with small pouer and charge,
When that I first, departed from Carthage:
And in Cycell went, with baners braide displaid,
Whire I took with feirs battle, arayde
An Cietie that had, Sarrogosse to name
In the which was many an seirse Roman
Dreuin to death: with many deadly wound
And maid their Cietie, equal with the ground
In feirse combat, and battle furious
I gart them stoup, though they were glorious.
It is known, how my notable puyssance,
Brought law the gloir, and great army of france.
And slew of them many an hundredth scoir,
Of me shall be remembrance ever moir.
Not only for venquissinge the Gallicains,
But for my ryuing, of the great mountains:
The high-Ilpes, and rocks I rent asundour,
And their great craigges, massdned by natour.
Which is the ramfort, of all Italye:
And when I entered, with my great army,
I gart many an stronde and many an flood,
Run read aspait, full of the Roman blood:
O Mynos if ye think that this be falls,
For witness take the Pow and Tyber als:
That often times I chainged, as men may reid,
Their Christa^^ waters, intill color reid:
Syne attoure their high castellis triumphantes,
I passed, with my myghtie Elephantes.
To the walls of Rome the narrest way,
It is reason, I count the great assaye.
The hard battailles, and chockes martians,
With my vailzeand deeds done befoir Cans,
Where I distroyed: ^hudge quantity,
Of Romans, and (...) their chief nobiliti^,
In record of my two arms vailzeant,
And in sign, of high honor triumphant,
Of their dead finge^s, I gart take syne:
Three punsions full, of gay gold ringes fine.
And send till Carthage, in witness of my might,
With the feirse Romans, yt to dead was dight:
I covered the ground, and earth humeid,
With the carions, and corpse of the deid:
On such an wise, that I maid air and lait,
Brigges to pas their reuers, read aspait.
The whole world, me fearde and was aghast,
Moir nor for tempest: haill or thundir blast.
I gart all shaike, and trimble where I went:
All nationes in the world were content,
The title of high honor, me to resinge,
Yet in my heart, vaingloir did never ringe,
As this Alexander, that for occatione,
Of an vncredable, and vain visione,
That in the night, appeared to his mother,
Say and that he had, Jupiter to father,
And should ruell all the world with an rod:
In earth he would be worshept as an God.
O Mynos, I am from an sinall souldioure,
Throw vailzeandise become an conqueroure:
Carthagien, that for hap or mischance,
That paissed all alyke in an balance.
As it is known, to the land of Afrique,
Durand my days, for the weill public:
Obeysant at all times, I randred me,
For their commonwealth, both by land and se:
With all my host for an s^^ple command,
Con^luded suddenly, an took on hand,
(...) waid Italy the n^^t^^ way:
Of my ardent curage, what shall I say?
My great tryumphe, my fame and hardines,
By my wertue, ingyne and high proves.
I brought till end, many an hard battaill:
Aganest the myghtiest, I did preuaill,
With my standards, and guydons marcyens:
I never went aganes the Armyniens.
Nor them of Meid, for they randred them sell:
For all their arms, fairges and speres fell.
They trymbled, dredand my han^^ wictorious.
The most suparbe, was Rome the orgulous,
With hardye souldartes feirs and well feghtand,
Without in fear the best in all that land:
Had of me, an heavy mortal deluge,
Bot Mynos, as thou art an ryghtious judge:
The eyes of Alexander, thou should considder,
When his father dyed, the realm all to gidder:
Fell in his handis, by right of heriditage:
Macidon him received, with high curage.
Wrapped in fauore, of amiable fortune.
That never was, in his acts importune.
I confess, he put many fro there ringes:
And vinquest Darius: with many other kings:
So was he vinquest, in his own delytes,
Be immoderat, and foulsome appetytes.
If that his father, followed and went:
After God Bacchus, in cheris vinolent:
So did he all, his days and never ceist,
Not like an man, bot dronckin as an beist.
Slew he not when he was dronckin, at his table?
Calesthines, phelosophre notable:
Because he said, that they should not exceirs:
The laws nor cleathing, of the land of Peirs,
In me such vices foull and detestable:
Might well be compted, half excusable,
That never knew, the humain disciplynes:
Of Arrestotle, nor wholsum doctrynes.
His master that in youthead him conduct,
Andaboue all otheres daily him instruct:
Arrestotle him never left, as ye may reid,
Whill that he put, the Crown vpone his heid*
Wherefore no man, should an Duke dispryse:
That has him self, exalted on this wise.
Regairding moir* honor and high proves:
Nor of all this world the whole riches:

Mynos. Decored are thy works, of excellence:
Alexandre, what say thou forthy defense?

Alexandre. It is not meit, to hold purpose or langage,
Aganest an man, that is full of outrage.
For my triumph and gloir, and actis are known*
With all nations, and throw the world blown,
Who will testify, by informatione,
That he should not have reputatione,
Above me, for to vant or yet compair:
I may not suffer, but will defend the contrair.
For knowye Mynos: judge full of prudence?
That in my youthead, and adolescence,
On my head, I bair an crown inuinsible,
And with the sherand sword, took ve^gance terrible,
On the traitors, that did my father sla:
And punished evil doers, many ma.
And not content, of the Realine that was mine,
But till conques honor, took me woe and pyne.
Then with standards, banners and harnes cleir:
First all my neighbors, I gart quaik and feir.
In my fury, I took the ancient town,
Of Thebes, and to the earth, I kest it down.
And subdwed, by my puyssance royal:
All the cieties, of Achaye and Thessall.
The Illyriens, in the field feghtand,
Their cragges knew my sword was well sherad:
With aufull terrors, all Greece to me obayed,
By my great puissance, was Asia inwayed,
And Lybie taken, then over the Phais I past,
Where ever was seyne, my standards at ye last:
On such an wise, they doubted my puyssance,
That they come trymbling, whole to my obeisance
My vailzeand deeds which I did exceirs,
I maid them known, to Darius king of Peirs.
Which come aganes me, with all his fors.
Of Peirsiens, an hundredth thousand horse:
And contrare me, come under his standards,
Three hundredth thousand, foot me^ hardy souldartes
What shall I say? when we come to straikis fell,
Old Charon: that great saypper is of hell.
Had much ado ye day, to gyde his rother,
To ferrye them fro the one side to the other:
I meyne ye spiretes, that I down to him send,
Of them that did, aganes me contend.
In aufull battaill I overcome their fors:
For all their chariottes, and bardid horse.
Aye in the hardest prese feghtand my sell,
That day of them I send down to the hell:
Four skoir a thousand souls, in an stounde,
And left their bloody bodies, on the ground,
Their great ruin, and wounds corporal:
Are records, of my victoures tryumphall.
I will not let, to count how in mine ire,
I besieged the vailzeand town of Tire,
With soir assaults, both by sea and land,
Because aganes me, they did withstand.
I put them all to sack, and did the cietie raise,
Syne I passed, the myghtie mount Caucais,
Till at the last, I danted all the world so,
Was none theirin, that durst declair him so.
But randred whole unto my will and mind,
In witness Porrus, the mighty king of and,
How that againes him, I did preuaill:
And maid him presoner, in strong battaill.
I venquest him, for all his gloir and might:
And maid him thrall, to me boith day and night.
Till at the last, I conquessed so long,
And cut the hard pillar, that Hercules the strong.
Maid in vain, thinkinge it could not be out past,
But breuelie to conclude, you at the last.
I rayssed and conquest, all without repose,
Unto the time, that crewell Atropose,
Ennemie to every man, on life leuand:
My large power, syne took forth of my hand,
Among the mundaine people terrestrial,
I was holden, as an God celestial.
My martial deeds, that was till allow,
Caused all them, fortill believe and trow,
That I was of God Jupiter beget,
My vailzeande heart, was prefixed and set,
To see the whole world and it embrace:
If crewell death, had left me time and space.
But yet O Mynos I pray the demand,
Of Hanniball, since he does me vilipande.
If he thinks on his sensual delytes:
At Capue, where his amorous appetyttes.
Was moir to Venus, and her son affixt:
Nor ever he was with martial deeds myxt,
He thought such shame, to leave heir meserable
That he maid his death, foull and detestable:
Willingly he drank, the furious poison sell,
He was homicide, and hangman of him sell,
Of high honor, forsuthe he was never dig^^e,
Ask of Prusias, that is of Birthin king:
When Hanniball, was in his glory may,
That samyng king, forth of the field him cha is it,
All the world knows, how he was thrall,
And subject, to his filthy pleasures all.
By many faint, and many falls treasoune,
He usurped this name, of high renoune.
His acts in sindr^ lands I confess:
But what are they, to speike of my proves?
To all the world, it is plane evident
That I thought all Ytalie, and Occident,
To be of less valor, nor Tassallie:
Or else I had conquest all Ytalie,
Without occicion, strife debait, or prese:
Unto the myghtie pillars of Herculese,
I would not deinze me for to dissender,
Allanerlie this high name Alexander.
Maid them all my subiectis, for fear and dread,
Wherefore Mynos, beware and take good head:
And not prefarre, his honor before mine.

Scipion. Have respect O Mynos who is worthy, syne,

Mynos. What art thou, declair to me thy name?

Scipion. I am Scipion, surnamed Affricain,
An Roman, of notable experience.

Mynos. Spacke hardly, I give the audience.

Scipion My hear^ ^oeth nether, think nor say ye shing,
For to be hard, nor yet till have lowing:
Throw my acts, myself for to decoire,
Above their vailzeand knights, to have gloire,
For it is not vningloir, that I desire:
But hear my life Mynos, I the require.
When I was young, and lusty in my flowers,
I detested vice, at all time and hours.
My heart and mind, was set without daliance,
To seek the honor, that virtue does auance.
And compted science, to be of valor noght:
Except it were with ardent mind and thought,
Inclyued till vertew, and Ciuilite,
Where with I conquest, all my nobilite.
But Mynos to conclude, and say the treuth,
I followed so vertwe, in my youth:
That I was called, in my adolessance,
And named, of Romans the Esperance.
When sindry Senates, had maid an band,
And concluded, for fear to leaf the land,
They were not willing to menteyne the weires,
But I with high curage, and young of yeires:
Come in the Senate where they all did stand,
And said these words, with drawn sword in hand.
The noble name, ye high tryumphe and gloir,
That Romany wan, of all nationes b^foir:
By their high prowes, vertwe and Renoune,
Shall it thus shamefullie, be castin down:
Who will on that way, ye sentence declair*
Shall be my enemy, for ever mair.
Then they tuke my, words for an sang:
Sayand that the Gods, for an abuant^^^,
For their common wealth, that I was to the^s^^^:
Aganest their enemies them to des^nd.
They all marvelled, of my audacitie,
In my young aige, my high capacity,
^as cause that over the great army Roman,
I was elect and chossen chief Captain.
Then with my b^^elie bauners, tryumphalt,
I preissed fast, after this Hanniball,
With litill help, small company or might:
I gart him turn, with shame and take the flight.
At length, I maid Carthage the opulent,
Serve bound and thrall: to Rome the excellent:
Not withstanding, all my victoryes,
The Romans fand me, in their consistoryes:
Als courts and ready, at their command,
As before, or that I took the sword in hand:
For worldly riches, I cared nothing:
The love of the people, was my lyking.
To show my virtue, and my civility,
To young princes, borne of nobility:
When Carthage was won, up and down I soght,
For all prisoners, and gart them be brought:
Before me, saife and sound without dyrence,
At that time. I took the poet Tyrence:
And captive to Rome, him brought with many mo,
Till at the last, I pleased the Romans so:
That in plasne Senate, for an conqueror.
They cheissed me, and maid me chief Censour.
That gart Asie, and Libie have remors,
As for Egypt, and Greece, I wan by fors,
Aganest them, into my quarr^ell just:
They knew, (...) was robust.
I maid the (...) ^omains tryumphall,
For to be feared, (...) ^red universal.
Or else they had, with shame taken ye s^ight:
And forsaken the land, for all their might,
I raised the name of Romans, to auance,
In Spaynge an fair cictie, named Nunance.
It were to long, O* Mynos to rehearse,
My noble acts, that are put in veirse,
My ennimies sand me, never aghast,
Nor yet my freindes: but humble and shamfast.
I know sense thou have ye electtione.
Thy indgement, to be without asfectione.
Yet I advertise the in peace nor weir,
I never miised me, to conques geir,
At all times, my hand was so liberal,
That I never hurded treasure pecuniall.
As was geuin, the Romans to understand,
After my death no worldly good they fand.
Of gold nor treasure within my bounds,
Except of silver foureskoir of pounds:
For the myghtie Gods, that are immortal,
With grate me indewed, supernatural:
In my weirs, I hated vice and creweltie,
I set up justice, and civility.
The furse of Bacchus, I did refuse,
With all the dulce pleasures, of soo^it Venuse*
Who are ennimyes, at all times and hours,
To all vailzeand, and noble Conquerours.
I say not this, my self for to promote:
And would be laith, their honor for till blote,
But will defend, unto the day of dome,
The honor, and the worthynes of Rome.
Mynos ye know. the Romans do excel,
All nations, better then my tongue can tell.

The sentence of Mynos.
Your martial deeds, with pains night and day,
Are brought to end, with many hard assay.
I say that all conquestes under the son,
Oght with reasone, and virtue to be won,
So Scipion is worthy, that did eschew,
All kind of vice, and followed virtue:
The high title, of honor precious,
Before you two, that were so vicious,
Wherefore we judge, Scipion to proceid,
And Alexandre: Hanniball to exceid,
And if ye think, our sentence importune,
It is to you two, to ask of fortune,
That fand her at all times, so favorable,
To fulfill your lusts, insaciable:
That still without repose, ye thought it good,
To shed and spill, the innocents blood:
Without propose, the world to molest,
Where virtue fails, reason may not rest.

I could not find so many, so unkind.
Finis quod Noruell.
