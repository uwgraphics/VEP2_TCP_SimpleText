TO HIS LOVING BRO: G. P. All health and peace.
KIND Bro: after many days not having visited you by any letter, nor lykwise
received any from you, I thought Good, and now high time, to write these few
unto you, not so much to acquainte you with any now matter worth labor, as to
make known more at large, and manifest what has be fallen me long since my
arrival in these parts. Neither take it in ill part that I have not certifyed
you so much ere now: even then (perchance) when you first heard some rumor of
me concerning the Catholic faith, for I would not rashly move such a matter,
or with out firm foundation acquaint you with that, which I should not be able
to defend. for you may not think me ignorant of what opposites I may suspect in
such a case, wherefore I thought it more secure for both parties, to defer it
until this time. Maruail not therefore, I pray you, either at my matter or
manner of writing, but patiently attend the end, and I doubt not but the
sequel will give you better content, or at least no just cause of offense. The
duty to our Mother, love to your self, and the rest our poor Brothers and
Sisters is cause of both, and therefore though I begin more abruptly then I
would or had intended, it is to avoid prolixite where the matter it self is so
urgent.

Most truly therefore was it said of an ancient Saint: Often times that which
we know not through our sloth the same by tears is made known unto us.
and an afflicted mind more certainly finds out a fault committed; and the
guilt which she remembered not in security, she clearlie perceaueth being
troubled. This is the cause why almighty God, in holy Scripture so often
admonishes us, Job c. 4.9.
who as Job says, dvvell in houses of clay, to pull down our plumes and
enter into consideration what state we stand in which certainly me thinks may
most aptly be applied unto us, for who (to omit the relation of our goulden
age, and days wherein we drank full cupps of pleasure and delight with all
content and least remembrance of God, and thanks for his benefits as we
ought) with these worldly afflictions so depressed as we? Who of his, most
supposed s^^ndes so forsaken as we? Nay who by his own blood and nearest
kindred so hardly dealt with all as we? But what? Job 2.9.
shall we hearken to Jobs wife, and bless God and die? No but rather with
patient Job in the next verse answer, thou have spoken like one of the
foolish women, if we have received good things of the hand of God, evil
things why should we not receive? Also the Prophet Esaie thundereth out the
most terrible comparisons he could devise, to a wake us out of this damnable
Lythargie of careless inconsideration of our state, and tells us saying: And
behold he shall come in have speedely etc. he will not slumber nor sleep etc.
all which threatninges in my understanding seem to have some peculier
reverence more unto me then you for as much as God has not once or twice moved
me by often conference, Esaie 5 27.
of the Catholic faith but also I have had Catholic books which might have
satisfied any man not altogether perverse, as indeed at that time I was; for
when at my frindes request I began to read, to wit, The Survey of the new
Religion, and that there did many things occure repugnant, or rather confuting
my affectionate religion in which I was nourished, my patience by no means
would search any further into it, but with all contempt did utterly reject it.,
which how foolish a thing it was I appeall to your own judgment. for admit
there were a Turk and a Christian contending about religion, and (as sure it
is) no way to be saved, but by the one only true Christian and Catholic faith
notwithstanding will obstinatlie content himself with his Turcisme in which he
had his being and bringing up, and not hear the contradiction of his Alchoran
by the knowledge of any other religion, how universal or warrantable soever
would you not repute him a madd man, and altogether inexcusable? certainly you
could not do less; much more an astrauagant Christian, bred out of the
Catholic Church, which not withstanding he has heard of by the general
consent of all, yea of her most spitefullest enemies to have been the Roman
Church, are so to have continued the first six hundred years pure and
vnspe^ted, with out stayne or corruption, yet not witstanding he will not give
ear to this faith or religion, or understand the cause justly why he should
refuse it, would you not, I say, condemn this man as worthy of double
punishment? certainly such an one was I but God for his long patience and
sufference who out of his infinite goodness and clemency has thus, through so
many troubles and strange accidents at length brought me to the true
knowledge of his service, and port of salvation, I render all humble thanks,
earnestly imploring his grace of perseverance, and if it be his good will and
pleasure, to seal the profession thereof, with my blood and life.

Now therefore Lo: Bro: not to detayne you longer from my intended scope, if you
approve of that comparison, borroweed from a christian and a Turk, then I pray
let me crave the same of you that you will at least grant me that favor, as
uprightly, not passionate or led with affection; to peruse this my labor, it
being awork indeed conducing to no momentary pleasure or profit but taken in
hand for your eternal good and future joy and glory in the world to come
where no sinister chance or froward fortune can ever bereave you of it. In this
labor (I say) my trauells first present themselves unto you for some special
causes hereafter notified; which verily I may account a travel to Damascus,
Act 9.28.
wherein a good Annanias (by our Saviors appointment) has caused to fall from
mine eyes those scales of ignorance where with I was formerly blinded so that I
may rightly say truth is great and prevails. ^. Esd. 4 41.
and least you should think me herein not to have dealt prudentlie, I entreat
you, even for the love of your own soul, approve or disprove of my
proceedinges as your own judgment (not forestaled with aslat resolution to
condemn me unheard) shall pass sentence, Deuteronomy. 12.31.
for my case being like to that of Moses, I dare say with Moses, and our very
enemies are judges. It is agreed upon betwixt us both how necessary a point
our salvation is, being for all eternity, and therefore I will save labor to
cite scripture in proof of that which is by neither part denied; but in vain
is the scope and end of a thing granted, if we differ in the means to
attain it: the means I assure my self you will say is the word of God which
I deny not: but let us not think the Gospel to be in the words of the
scripture, but in the sense; not in the out side, but in the inside or marrow;
not in the leaves of the words, but in the sapp pith, or root of reason, other
wise even the Devil himself speaks Scripture; cap 1^.1^
and all heresies according to that of Ezechiel make unto them selves pillowes
which they may lae under the elbow of every age, and to gu^y you a taste hereof
(for this matter concerning my soul nerely, I have bestowed some diligent
search herein) consider with me I pray you, how of ancient time the old
heretic Marcion found means to reject both Moses and all the Prophets, and
what did he pretend? cap. 10.7.
Surely Scripture: to wit that of Saint John, how many soever have come
before me are thieves and robbers. the Armenians also taught that the whole
femal sex of women should be wholly extinct, and that we should all rise in
the last judgment in the state of man and what was their ground? cap. ^.13.
Scripture also: to wit, that to the Ephesians: until we all meet in the
unity of faith, and knowledge of the son of God into a perfect man. The
Mainchers also proved our Savior to be this material sun which we daily
see with our eyes, and what color had they? scripture also, John 8.12.
to wit where our Savior says: I am the light of the world how did the
Waldenses prove that even a lavvfull judge or Magistrate could not put to death
the greatest Malefactor that was? Exodus 20.13.
by scripture: Thou shall not Kill, by Scripture also the Circumcellians held
that every Christian might not only murder his fellovv, but lay violent hands
upon himself, for (say they) it is written; John 12.25.
he that hates his life in this world, does keep it to life ever lasting.

Thus out of these few to omit many more, we see how all heretics like
serpents, in imitation of that old serpent the Devil, who came with scripture
even to our Savior himself, do lurks under the tree of knowledge (I mean the
scripture) that so they may more cunningly conueigh their deadly poison; and
surely though these examples of ancient times were sufficient to teach every
man humility, seeing as a prudent man does well observe, he that will need be
his own Scholar has commonly a fooll, to his master; yet wantes there not
neither sufficient occasion even in our times to be careful in this so weighty
a business: for how shall I think the protestants in these days to agree
upon the true sense of scripture, when they cannot a gree about the translation
it self, which must be the grownd where upon they work: by which dissension
also they show themselves to have descended in doctrine from these old
heretics in the primitive church. For does the protestant believe the
scriptures not to be received so fully and wholly as the Catholic, or (as it
pleases him) papist does but rather certain chapters and books, which seem
to him (or rather indeed, to this brain sick fancy) not so a greable to the
purity of the gospel, to be cut of and excluded the number of holy writ?
the same did the Carpocratians. Seuerians and Manichees who condemned all the
old testament as a thing feigned from an evil beginning and yet certainly not
without scripture, as you may set in the example of Marcion first produced. In
like manner Cerdon denied all the Evangelists except S. Luke; Cerinthus all
except S. Matthew; the Seuerians also took away the Acts of the Apostles, and
with the Ebionites all the epistles of S. Paul; the Alogians likewise esteemed
the Apocalypse of S. John for an invention of Cerinthas. Now that you are one
with these (at least in this point of mayming scripture) is manifest, for do
not the most excellent of your whole clergy, and first publishers of your
gospel, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Illiricus, and the Magdeburgenses exclude
many of the Apostles epistles from all communione of holy scripture, under
pretense of examining it by the rule of the deuyne word? Certainly they can by
no means dissemble it, in the epistles of S. John, Jude, James, and S. Paul to
the Hebrews, which in this my compendium, were to long to prove at large;
but to come yet more nere you. Do not also your later Doctoures in this
especially imitate these their predecessors? yes most exactly, as here is
sufficiently confirmed. In the fourth disputation had with F. Campian the
Jesuit in the tower of London, your Doctoures did expressly censure these books
(by the authority only of four or sieve) to be Apocriphall, to wit, the book
of vvisdome, Syrach, Judith, Toby, the 4. books of Esdras, Baruch,
Ecclesiasticus, Hester, and the Machabees, in the new testament; the gospel
of S. Luke, S. Paul, to the Hebrews, the second epistle of S. Peter, the
tvvoe last epistles of S. John, S. James, and the Apocalypse, Luther also calls
the epistle of S. James a strawen epistle, and of no truth, and not worthy the
spirit of an Apostle. All which compared together your Doctors in this opinion
of paring scripture, cannot but drink of the same cup with those old
condemned heretics.

But after; seeing their folly, and that they could by no means defend, what
thus rashly they had enterprized, by often mutation and change they came to
that text which you now have; but yet even to this day, with what dubitation
this is done and correction (or rather to speak truth corruption) their often
impressions do manifestly testify, and I think you are not ignorant, how
many several translations there have been within these few years, I can
remember thee since my first acquaintance with London; which mutabilitie
plainly argues they are those fond builders of whom our Savior makes
mention are shaken with every blast, because they build not upon the rock
which is the church, The pillar and firmament of truth. 1. Tim. 3.15.
But upon the shallow sands of their own unsettled brains: and this I speak
not of my self, but by the testimony of themselves, which you may see more
convenient and at large hereafter, yet it shall not be discomodious if in the
mean time we examine one of their chiefest linguists in England; M. Broughton
therefore in his epistle to the Lords of the council desires them to procure
speedily a new translation, because that (says he) which is now in England
is full of errors. And in his aduertisment of corruptions to the protestante
Bishops says: That there public translation of scriptures into English is
such as it peruerteth the text of the old testament in eight hundred forty
eight places, and that it causes millions of millions to reject the new
testament, and to run to eternal flames; will not then every man, that has
but any feeling of his soul look about him, seeing as I said before. Even our
enemies are judges on my side; neither can it be excused by saying they are but
small differences, seeing M. Broughton here says that it Causes Millions of
Millions to run to eternal flames.

Wherefore good Bro: as you love your own souls health, and would avoyde
these eternal flames, pass not over these slightly, or with me (as I once
did) reject the farther search this, because it does so manifestly detect your
horrible abuses, which may seem incredible; but if you will examine any one of
them you shall find it as evident and much more at large: this concerns
eternity, this concerns your soul, yea this does admonish you of the eternal
glory or perpetual misery both of body and soul in hell flames without
redemption; wherefore once more I beseech you, as you tender your eternal weal
or woe, and have some feeling of Gods fearful judgments, Matthew. 25.41
as this dreadful sentence from our Savior: get you away from me you cursed
into fire everlasting, which was prepared for the Devil and his Angels.
Neither may you think (as some in England, I speak what I have known) that a
man may be saved by any religion for to such our Savior will say: Matthew. 7.11.
not every one that says to me Lord, Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven: but he that does the will of my father which is in heaven.

Dear Bro: if this be true as it cannot be false, proceeding from truth it
self, then I pray with all attention and diligent study seriously examine this
labor, for S. Paul does likewise tell you, that there is one Lord one faith
one Baptism, one God and father of all; Ephesians. 4.5.
wherefore upon due examination being convinced in conscience, let not a s^^wne
of this world, or any momentary affliction, yea though an other Nero, Domitia^,
or Dioclesian should tyrannice in this your persecution, cause you to smother
your precious soul in hells black flames (from whence no ransom may ever
free you, or penance ease your torment) by denying his faith and church, who
has laid his life, and most precious blood for your redemption from this
eternal woe, und misery: no I say, in despite of all such cruelty be resolved
and with a resolute currage say with S. Paul, None of all these do I fear;
Act. 20.2^.
neither do I make my life more precious then my self so that I may finish the
course and ministry which I have received of our Lord Jesus to testify the
gospel of the grace of God: yea especially, I say, Matthew. 12.10
take courage when as our Savior says he which is not with me, is against me,
and he which gathers not with me scatters. And in an other place he bides
us enter by the straight port: because the broad gate, Matthew. 7.13.14.
and spacious way leads to perdition, and many there are which enter through
it, how narrow is this Port, and way straight which leads to life, and
fevv there are that find it?

2. Tim. 4.
Wherefore do but invoke S. Paul with a sincere heart, that he would obtain
for you grace to confess and die in this one faith, and you shall be heir to the
king of heaven, and have a crown of glory with the same S, Paul, which I hope
you will, and with every magnanimous Christian avert that dismal sentence of
our Savior where ^e says: Matthew. 10.^2
Every one therefore that shall confess me before men I also will confess him
before my father which is in heaven, but he that shall deny me before men, I
also will deny him before my father which is in heaven. And what other thing
is it (I pray you) thus to be denied, then undoubtedly adjudged to hell; there
to remain with weeping and gnashing of teeth for all eternity.

But to our purpose thus long interrupted leaving these rather to your pious
consideration to enlarge at your pleasure, then other wise longer to insist
upon them; If therefore you ask me what translation then is best, I answer the
old, commonly called S. Hieromes; if you say he was a papist; listen I pray not
vvithstanding what Beza your chief translatour of scripture, See Beza upon the
first of S. Luke, and first verse de ^at. interpretat. lib. 1. page 74.
says of him: the old interpreter (says he) seems to have interpreted the
holy books with marvelous sincerity and religion: And Doctor Humfrey our
country man, speaks thus of him: the old interpreter seems sufficiently
bent to follovv the propriety of words, and he does it indeed to carefully
which notvvithsta^ding I suppose him to have done not out of ignorance, but of
religion and conscience. So that you see if there were any fault in our old
interpreter, it was because he was to scrupulous and careful, to full of
conscience and religion in following the exact signification of the greek,
which is a very good fault, if it must needs be called a fault, and also
commended and justified else where by Doctor Humfrey himself in these words:
Ibid. page 179
In profane writings a man may rainge more freely, and depart from the
words, in Canonical scripture no such license is tolerable for it is not
lavvfull for man to alter the tongue of God? and by way of exposition to make
this more perspicuous, I oppose Calvin to our old interpreter, and observe I
pray what censure a protestant also gives of Calvin: Calvin in his harmony
(says Charles Moliuers in his translation of the new testament part 11. fol.
110.) Makes the text of the gospel to leap up and down as the truth it
self declares. He uses violence to the letter of the gospel, and in many
places clean transposeth it, and besides this he adds to the text; The like
censure I find given of Luther, not by a Papist, but a Protestant, tom. 2. ^d
Luther. lib. de Sacram. fol. 412. 413.
and one of the chiefest in his time, to wit, Zuinglius who after detection of
many corruptions, Thus concludes. See how thy case stands (Luther) that in
the eyes of all men, thou art seen to be a manifest and common corruptour of
scripture, which thing thou can never deny before any creature, how much
are we a shamed of thee, who hither to have esteemed thee beyond all
measure, and now try thee to be such a false fellovv? To conclude therefore
this point of translation, attend what Beza says: in praeface new, test. anno
1556.
how vnvvorthily (says he) and with out cause does ^rasmus blame the old
interpreter, as dissenting from the greek; neither ought you think that
therefore I commend Bezas translation, because I bring him in commending yours;
for wherein he swarned from us in Doctrine, he swarued also in translation,
though with out grownd; and therefore he is also reprehended by his fellow
protestants, as namely Castalio saying; in defens. translat. page 170.
to note all errors (says he) of Beza in traslating the new testament, the
work would require to great a volume. So that how shall a man build his
faith upon these men, who in the very grownd work it self a gree no better
then the confusion of tongues in the Tower of Babell, which that you may with
more facility and ease apprehend, I have written more in particular hereafter.

But here perchance you may further move a question, what my intent and scope
may be in vvritting all this, and making such collection, of places; I
answer, only that you may have some sight and knowledge of the Catholic
faith, vvherby you shall the better judge of me and see your own estate,
without which faith there is no salvation by our Saviors own words.
Matthew. 12.^0
He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me
scatters. And as S. Paul says: Romans 10.14.
How shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? which I suppose you
as yet never truly understood, wherefore if this be true, I pray grant me this
reasonable request, that you will at least read my endeavors, Phil. 3.8.
and say with S. Paul; I esteem all things to be detriment for the passing
knowledge of Jesus Christ, for whom I have made all things as detriment,
and esteem as dounge that I may gain Christ. And surely no marvel seeing
the mouth of Christ has uttered: Matt. 16.26.
what does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and sustain the
dommage of his own soul; in this being that (one thing) which he insinuates
where he says. Martha, Martha, Luc. 10.41.
thou art troubled about very many things, but one thing is necessary. So
that seeing this one thing is so necessary, vvher upon all other things
depend, happy yea thrice happy is that man that does attain unto it, but by
reason the breuity of a Brotherly letter will not permit so large a discourse,
let your discreet and religious judgment, I beseech, be the comment upon so
small a text, and what in words is wanting suppose in effect to be most
abundant.

But of that common humor of setting light by thease things, and rejecting
whatsoever is not ansvvereable to your affection, do reign in you, and
vvilfull passion ouersvvay reason, a common deceit ever in such cases
practysed by the Devil to lead poor soul^s cap^tue to eternal perdition, if
(I say) this venim have so seized upon you, and infected your senses, that you
have no feeling or care of that, to wit, your souls health, the very
remembrance whereof made the son of God our Dear Savior sweat drops of
blood, Luc 22 42.
desiring his father if it were possible that chalice might pass from him.
If, (I say) you are thus possessed with a resolution to forsake and reject all
good advise, what is left form, but only with the Prophet Hieremie, to
lament your miserable case? But what? is it true? was your redemption so
great an agony to our Savior, that the only remembrance thereof made him
sweat blood, and will you esteem it a thing of so small moment, as rather to
content your self with that estate, I say, with that religion, which you
received from an Apostata Monk Martin Luther not yet a hundred years since,
then to seek the true knowledge of God, and his service, in the Catholic
church, which our Savior promised should never err, Matt. 16.187
and that the gates of Hell should not prevail against her? yea which will be
to your greater damnation, your own Doctors and Ministers grant, the true
Apostolic Doctrine to have been taught in the Roman Church with all
sinceretie the first six hundred years, and can it be that the corruption of
only one hundred, by a dissolute Apostata Monk may violat our Saviors credit
with six hundred years practyse? I cannot think it, at least in you for what
can there be more wicked and deuoyd of human reason then God to be solicitous
for man's evils, and he himself nothing regard them? if other wise, and that I
am herein deceived, Matt. 26.21.
Oh horride and dreadful sentence, it where good for him if that man had not
been borne. yea verily Hell it self will roar, and crave his right saying:
why do I not devour and excruciate this wretch in our eternal flames,
long since there due? My good Bro: if I seem more earnest then is meet,
excuse me, I pray you, it proceeds from no ill affection, but that tender
brotherly love, and zeal which I bear to wards both your body and soul.
not he which desires (with Baal) to die the death of the righteous, or shall
cry Lord, Number 23.10. Matt. 7.21.
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he which does the will of
his father which is in heaven, and lives the life of the righteous.

If you think my manner of writing strange and from my accustomed style
suppose my condition to be altered, and that with holy Job I humbly thank God
for all his afflictions and crosses laid upon me, as peculier blessings and
pledges of his further love, whereby he has taught me in some sort to know my
self, and that miserable state of blind ignorance, in which I have hitherto
lived in: Now therefore understand that having changed master, I have also
changed liuorie, no more a protestant but now a Catholic, no more a vassale
or bondslaue to Satan and his ministers, but now a servant and follower of our
Savior Jesus Christ, and his Apostles, whom I earnestly beseech in my daily
prayers, that God will be no less merciful unto you, then he has been
compassonate on me, that he will here also teach you your haruist, that in the
world to come, we may joyfully reap eternal bliss together but S. Austin
says: he which made thee without thee will not justify or save thee without
the wherefore once more I pray you, with true zeal and hearty devotion bestovv
your labor upon this my travel, and I doubt nothing of Gods grace, here is
the life you must make your incorruptible treasure, in the next is nothing
heard but immutable eternity, where all things pass according to this life
well or ill if well, happy man that ever he was borne; if ill, vvoe and not
temporal but eternal misery, yea according to that of our Savior; it were
good for him if that man had not been borne, because there is no place (for
such as depart not this life in state of grace) of sorrow to amendment
wherefore in vain shall you then lament, vvoe wretch that I am, what shall I
do whither shall I go? I that have lost so great opportunity of reconciling
my self unto God? I that have contemned, rejected, and despised all good
admonitions to eternal bliss? finally I that have let slipp so larg a
benefitt as to do penance and satisfaction for my sin vvhither shall I now
fly? who will receive me? the guilt of my own conscience is as thorns to
my heart, my own members accuse me, and incessantly call for revenge. These me
thinks well examined should move any heart if not obdurate to a most serious
examination of his estate.

But what do I trouble you with all these? you are not the principal object of
this my study. No it is you Dear Mother, who is the special cause of all this
endeavor, and for whose eternal future happiness (to requit in some part your
motherly care, and trouble for us in our infancy) all our thoughts and vital
spirits do labor with daily and earnest prayer that God will at lenght have
mercy upon you, and that you may be not only a common mother of nature, 2.
Machab. cap. 7.2^.
but rather such a Mother of Martyrs as we read of in holy scripture, if you
should be hold me your son under the hand of some Antiochus, ready either to
suffer death, or violate the laws of our forefathers, you would with a true
Christian Motherly courage stepp forth and say: I beseech thee my son that
thou look to heaven and earth etc. and understand, that God of nothing made
them and mankind, so shall it come to pass that thou will not fear this
torment etc. take that death that in that mercy I may receive thee again: for
then should you find me an answereable son to that of hers, and hear me say
(by the grace of God) with him: My brethren (I mean all Cotholicke martyrs)
having now sustained short pain are become under the testament of eternal
life and I as also my brethren, v. 36.37.
do yield my life and my body for the law of our forefathers: inuocating God
to be propitious to our nation (England) quickly.

In that I rather choose to come thus mediatly unto you, impute it not I pray
you, to any forgetfullnes of duty or want of filial affection, but only the
tender respect I have of that dangerous estate in which you daily sleep, yea
rather dye then live, which when I duly consider and look into, I confess I
am in a manifold mind, and as perplexed as he that encountreth diverse ways and
knows not which to take. My duty to your person and desire of your salvation,
bides me be bold and persuades that I cannot perform a better office (yea an
office by the law of nature bound unto) then to advertise you of so eminent a
danger, but on the other side I fear least my duty be thought ambition, to
instruct her from whom I had my first being; and because, truth breeds
hatred; I fear I may force: an unwelcome duty in place of a filial office,
and so may incur the same displeasure which S Paul did by his plain dealing
saying: Gal 4.16.
I am become your enemy telling you the truth: and be esteemed a foe in that
office wherein I meant to show my self most dutiful: but at length rather
resolved, that I should do best as good Surgeans and Physicians do; force a
bitter pill, or smarting salve then suffer a patient to perish. Moreover I
presume that your true zeal (though wrong employed) wisdom, and discreet
judgment will more esteem the gentle reproof of one wishing you all happiness,
then the smothe flaterie of a foul deceauer, and that you will not interpret
that in an ill sense, which is meant with all sincerity and true affection:
wherefore the same that I craved of my brother, in these few words I humbly
entreat of you, that you will not despise, t^is my duty, as a matter of small
or little moment, which I have already sufficiently proved to be other wise?
but that with all attention and patience you will receive it, and so to your
future glory and eternal comfort make the best use of it: Apoc 2.2.
Therefore as with S. John I may say: I know thy works and labor and thy
patience* v 4.
so like wise. But I have against thee a few things, thou have left thy first
Charity (which once our ancestors had in the Catholic church) be myndfull
therefore from whence you are fallen (to wit; from that church our Savior
promised should never fall) and do penance and the first works; Matt. 16.18.
that is, the works first practys d and preached by the Apostles, not lately
invented by Apostataes: have regard also I pray you to the whole chapter
follovving and compare it with the arrogancy (which also you shall find
hereafter written) of these our modern heretics, Luther, Calvin and
Zuinglius, and you shall find them to be the very persons, to whom it may
most sitly be applied, and consequently to your Church of England, for these
(as you all with one consent acknowledge) arre the men that first illuminated
our land with the light and true knowledge of the word of God, which light
notvvitstanding (as is most apparent) brought with it a foul spirit of
dissension, for who knows or sees not how you are divided amongst your
selves.

Dear Mother being by heresy cut off from the Church, what hope can you
have of salvation? if I should allege the terrible threatninges of ancient
fathers against such as are out of the Church (notwithstanding you least
account of their authority) I fear, that endeavoring only to beat into you a
fear of damnation, I should drive you to utter despair. And certainly although
God and his Church be always ready to receive you to mercy, yet if you resolve
to dye out of the Church, live you never so well morally, you have just cause
to expect no part in the Church triumphant, (...) 1^ 17.
who dye no member of the Church militant: for what says our Savior: if he
will not here the Church, let him be to thee as the heathen and publican. And
in an other place speaking of those which will not hear nor receive the
Apostles (and in them the Catholic Church) he says. (...) ^p. (...).
Amen I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of the Sodomites and
the Gomor^heans in the day of judgment, then for that City: Also you may
hear S. Cyprian what the primitive Church taught in his time concerning those
that were not of it. They cannot live with God, lih. de vnitate Ecclesiae.
that will not live in unity and concord with his Church, and although they
burn in flames and being delivered to the fire, or cast to wild beasts, do
lay down their life for Christ, there shall be no crown of glory for any such,
but the punishment of his infidelity. such a man may suffer death but crowned
he cannot be. And again: What? those that are assembled to gether out of the
church of Christ when they shall be so assembled, do they think Christ is with
him? such althouh they dye for the confession of the nam of Christ, that deadly
spoot and grievous fault of discourd neither is it washed a way by his blood
nor purged by suffering, a Martyr he cannot be which is not in the Church
neither shall he come unto the kingdom, who has foresaken her who shall
reign. tom. 7. de gestis cum fine ric^.
hither to S. Cyprian. S. Austine tells you that you may have honor,
servants, you may sing Alleluya, answer Amen, you may have the gospel, you
may believe, and preach in the name of the Father, the son and the holy ghost,
you may have althinges with out the Catholic church except salvation. but
alas what (all) is that which comprehends not that which is as in all. And
again in an other place he says: lib 4. de Symb ad Catechu. tom. 9. cap. 12.
neither shall he have God for his father, that will not have the church for
his mother neither shall it profitt him that he has believed, or that he has
done such abundance of good works without the end of the chiefest good. S.
Hierome also says: Epist. ad Dam. and 24. q. 1. cap. quoniam.
who soever shall eat the lamb with out this house, he is profane, if any man
be not in the Ark of Noah, he shall perish in the deluge, much more concerning
this point might be said, lib. 4. instit. c. 2. q 4.
but to conclude with Calvin himself who says; that out of the bosom of the
church no remission of sins is to be hoped for nor any salvation yea S.
Austine says: Sermon 181. de tempore.
he is no Christian, that is not in the church of Christ. Wherefore good Mother
you that have lived all your time in heresy, and consequently offending God, I
humbly beseech you, for your own eternal good, and your Childrens salvation,
examine well what I have taken pains in, and as I assure you out of S. Paul,
Phil. 3.8.
you shall not think your labor ill bestowed.

After all, being inconscience convinced let not the fear of the loss of your
princes favor, deprivation of liuinges, or temporale commodities hazard
eternity and spiritual salvation, but in the midest of so many sects and
heresies, maugre the Devil and his ministers, Ibidem.
in despite of time one swaying authority say with S. Paul, I esteem them all
as dung that I may gain Christ. Also the same Apostle willbe judged by your
self whether it be better to obey God then man. Moreover the king of heaven
himself does promise you, Matt. 19.29.
that if you leese, house or brethren, or Sisters, or father or mother, or wife
or Children or lands for his names sake, you shall receive an hundred fould,
and shall possess life everlasting: Also that in this life you may not suspect
his fatherly care and providence to be wanting unto you in such temporal
necessaries as you shall need he bidds you not to be careful what you shall
either eat or drink, Matt. 6.25.
or what raiment you shall put on, but first seek the kingdom of God and
these things shall be cast upon you: All which promises S. Paul has experienced
saying: 2. Cor. 48.
In all things we suffer tribulation, but are not in distress: we want,
but are not destitute; we suffer persecution but are not forsaken: we are
cast down, but we perish not: King David says also that he never knevv the
righteous forsaken nor their seed seek their bread wherefore having so good
warrant of comfort and reward in this service, Psalm. 36. v. 25.
as from the Lord of Lords himself our Dear Savior, who to requit you as S.
Paul says will adopt you heir of his inheritance; resolve then at length to
fear God more then man, Hell, then temporal loss separation from Gods
Church, then leaving of lands, liuinges, Country, yea life it self, for as S.
Austine says: Tract. 27. in Joan.
their is nothing that a Christian man ought so to fear, as to be separated
from the body of Christ, which is the Church, as it is one Catholic Church
for if he be separated from the body of Christ, he is no member of him, but who
soever has not the spirit of Christ, he is not of Christ. pardon me good
mother in this my so long and tedious a discourse, I know your fervent zeal
and fear of God (but what? misled) required none at all, the nature of an
epistle, a much shorter: But the danger in which you live, and the desiere I
have of your salvation, with the rest of your whole family in the same state of
perdition, could not, as I thought be satisfied with a briefer.

Excuse, I humbly beseech, you my so plain dealing, I do (as I told you in
the beginning) but as good Surgeans and Physicians are wont, who are most
loueing to their patients, when most cruel to their diseases, and love no
less when they Cherish by fomentations, ointments, and restoritiues, then when
they chastise by bitter potions, cutings, and cruel launcinges, because
both-heale. I once more beseech you therefore, and as far as I may presume
conjure you, that for the glory you are to give unto God, the duty you owe
his Church, the joy you may purchase to his Saints and Angles, Luc. 15.7.10.
which rejoice more at the conversion of one sinner that does penance then at
Ninty Nine just which need no penance* yea for the example you may and ought to
give your family, and the whole world, the comfort and eternal crowns of
glory, which by your conversion your frindes and Children shall reap, the
fear you ought to have of Hell, the hope of heaven, and desire of your own
salvation you would vouchsafe to weigh and penetrate the dangers where with
you are environed. I will not urge you any farther in this kind, but only crave
of you to propose to your self death, Hell, Heaven, Judgment, Eternity, and
that you would not prefer your own private opinion, seeing as, a prudent man
did well observe: he that will be his own Scholar has commonly a fool to
his master not I say to prefer any judgment before Gods Church which he
promised should never err in all antiquity. Neither let us so esteem of this
life (which as the scripture says is a vapor, a fume, yea nothing) that we
forget heaven and eternity: Alas, Dear Mother, as our Savior says what does
it profitt a man to gain the whole world and sustain the loss of his own
soul? Matt. 29.19.
Old age tells you that you are in the wayning of your days, that your glass
is almost run, that your spring, yea summer is spent, you are in the fall of
the leaf and your winter is at hand; the axe is laid, to the root, and where
soever the tree shall fall, there it will a bide, you have served the world
hitherto in sin and heresy, to leave it now, is not so much to leave it, as
to prevent it, for shortly it will leave you for the unexpected coming of
death, you want not of your nearest knired whose suddayne departure may be
sufficient examples, yea the only death of our father (nosmale grief to me)
may suffice us in this.

To have erred hitherto is humane, to persevere (as I may term it) is
beastly: you have given your life past, to heresy and her accomplices, give at
least the remnant and surplus to God and his Church: you have given as one
says the maine croppe io the enemy of mankind the redeemer let at least glean
the reproof of your harvest, and he will requite you as he promises a
hundredth fold, and with life ever lasting.

O Mother, Pardon yet once more I earnestly beseech you, my bouldnes and rough
manner of writing; 2. Cor. 116.
I confess with S. Paul I am rude in speech, yet tolerable in opening to you
the mean how to escape so great a danger, as the eternal perdition both of
body and soul, in which peril (as I said) you daily sleep in, your time
therefore is but short and you have a great account to render; your conscience
(upon the understanding of these) cannot but urge you, your sins call upon
you, the judge expects you, embrace then the Roman Catholic church for your
mother, and God will ever be your father, accuse your self and God will excuse
you, be sorry for your sins and they shall not be imputed unto you, permit
the priests sentence to pass on you, and Gods wrathful sentence shall not
touch you. If you will mount the hills of Armenia, enter the arc of Christ's
Church, if you will ascend the higher heaven, enter this lower, yea this is the
way and only mean. To have lived hitherto in sin and heresy is danger, to
dye in this estate (as our Savior and his Apostles witness) is certain
damnation.

But I have been to long and therefore must rather abruptly conclude, then any
way finish this my present discourse wherefore as my last greeting and farewell I
humbly beseech you, for the tender good of your own soul, and so many which
depend upon you (a great account to answer for) to wouchsafe the reading, or
at least relating by some other, these my pains and trauells taken in your be
half; that so at length (all points and doubts clearly proved) you may with
the people in Esdras say: ^. Esdras 4.^2.
truth is great and prevails: and that I as S. Ambrose at the conversion of
S. Austine, may sing. We praise thee God etc you assuming the part of S.
Austine with a cheerful countenance and heavenly responsorie answer, we
confess thee our Lord etc. and finally be incorporate a member of Christ's
mystical body here on earth, his church in which an obedient child,
concluding your last day, as the soul of poor Lazarus was by his good Angel
conueighed into Abraham's bosom so your guarden or good Angel with a triumphant
victory from that roaring Lion, enemy to man kind the Devil, may present
your glorious soul: a sweet smelling odor to our Lord Jesus Christ, and there,
with the whole court of heaven his fellow Angels, Luc. 15.7.10*
(as our Savior says) rejoice at so glorious a conquest which that it may
sort according to my desire and that I may, as Job says, Job 19.27.
see you with these my eyes in that eternal glory, I most earnestly and
humbly beseech our Savior, who has so long expected you to mercy, that you
may make your chief commodity of this exhortation and some use also of this
my no less painful then long admonition that in this life you may so purchase
is grace, as in the next eternal glory. Amen.

Your obedient son, to the utter most that he may I. P.

Catholic faith. fol 1. 2 The same faith was universally professed for sundry
ages before, and was also agreeable to that first faith where unto the Brittans

fol. 8. 5 Scripture is not easy to understand. fol. 10. 6 Scripture is not for

Catholics fol. 21. 8 Scripture some time in Question. fol Ibid. 9 Scripture
never admitted by the Catholic church. fol. 22. 10 The Protestants pretense
of only scripture is frivolous and Idle. fol. 10. 11 Protestants disagreeing
translations; and Acknowledge. etc. fol. 27. 12 The church cannot nor ought not
to have erred. fol. 31. 13 The church does consist of good and bad. fol. 33. 14

precepts of Christ are not impossible. 95. 22 To beseech the prayers of the
righteous here on earth is no derogation to our Savior. fol 100. 67. 23 The
Saints and Angels in heaven know our doings and wantes better then men. fol.
101. 24 Of Saints Relics. fol. 112. 25 Of the holy cross and Images. fol.

fol. 149. 30 Of the efficacle of Sacraments. fol. 16. 31 Of Baptism, and the
necessity thereof, fol 166. 32 Of the venerable Sacra. of the Eucharist as the
form, Consecration, Real presence, great care observed (had more thereof, then
of the water of Baptism) lest any part thereof should fall to the ground,
mixture of water with wine in the Chalice, and the receiving thereof Fasting and

obligatory fol. 245. 39 Of Antichrist, and the Aulters and Sacrifice which he
is fore told to take a way, Daniel 12.11. fol. 247. 40 The Roman faith proved
to be the true Catholic faith by Dionysius Areopagita, and Hermes, most
ancient and Apostolic fol. 248. 41 To show no beginning of a Doctrine is an
infallible token, that it is, and proceeds from the Apostles 249. 42 True
Miracles make a strong argument for the true faith, and that the foresaid
faith whereunto the English were converted was confirmed by such Miracles fol
251. 43 Our Adversaries opposing Fathers against Fathers answered fol. 255. 44
Our Adversaries general abiuring the fathers, and condemning their Doctrine
fol. 257. 45 The continual Purity of the Roman church acknowledged by our
Adversaries fol. 261. 46 The Catho. of Romans faith now taught is acknowledged by
47 Protestants for sufficient unto salvation 264. 48 A Testimony from the
enemy is of greatest account. fol. 165. 49 Of the Purity or, rather
arrogancy of the church of England fol. 266. 40 Of Heretics impudency fol.
268. 51 Heretics Raylinges one against an other fol. 274. The Deaths of
Luther, Zuinglius, and Calvin 181.
To confirm these articles I will use this triple probation, Scripture, the
fathers or Doctors of the primitive Church, and Confession of the Adversary
himself. And to the end it may be the more evident, that the Protestant
religion is no other, then a brainsicke invention, composed of old condemned
heresies, and also that you may see how repugnant your new reformers, Luther
and Calvin, are in Doctrine, to the primitive church, I have under every chief
article adjoined their doctrine, with the old condemned heresy from whence
they derive it. Also for your better satisfaction I have here next following
placed a true Catologue of the Pops of Rome, and Doctors of the Catholic
church which may certify you the age, and time when things were done, so
that to! Say the Doctors of the church, or church did err, is frivolous, for
choose your time wherein you would have it to be most pure, yea even whilst the
Apostles themselves lived, you shall here find it proved both by the Doctors,
and whole church of that age, and likewise by the confession of the chief and
most learned ministers you have had, that the Roman faith now taught, was the
same with that, then generally held in Gods church for the true Apostolic
faith.

But that my oil be not all in waste read with humility and prayer that God
would assist you; for S. Paul says: 1. Cor. 3.6. Iac. 1.6. Matt. 7.7.
I planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase. And S. James says: God
gives abundantly to all; yea our Savior himself bideth you ask, and if
shall be given you, wherefore there only rests on your part that you ask with
all sincerity and purity of heart, not drawn away, or led with any
preiudicate opinion, or Sinister respect. This S James craves of you where he
bideth you ask in says nothing doubting. That is, with a fervent desire and
true zeal of the knowledge of God and his service, ready to embrace and
prefer it before all the world.

Matthew. 16.18. etc. And I say unto thee, because thou art Peter, and upon this
roke will I buyld my Church; and the gates of hell shall not preuail against
her, and I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and what soever
thou shall bind one earth shalhe bound in heaven, and what soever thou shall
loose one earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

And he gave some Apostles, and some prophets, and other some Evangelists, and
othersome pastors and Doctors (to what end?) to the consummation of Saints
unto the work of the ministry, unto the edifying of the body of Christ (for
how long?) until we all meet in the unity of faith, and knowledge of the
son of God into a perfect man, into the measure of the age of the fulness of
Christ (for what cause, or benefit?) that we be not children, wavering and
carried about with every vvind of Doctrine in the wickedness of man, in
craftines to the circumuention of error.

The Author to the Reader.
Gentle Reader, for as much as through diverse, and urgent occasions withdrawing
me, I could not attend the press my self, or procure any to supply my place,
with that care, and diligence, which is required, especially in such
abusinesse, which ought very carefully to be attended, once begun; and lykwyse
constrained to make use of a stranger (altogether ignorant in our tongue) for
the press, through these, I say, and such other inconveniences, there have
escaped many errors, for which I would entreat patience, and that they be not
altogether imputed unto my negligence, or taken in ill part, the rather because
I do not find any, that do so obscure the sense, but it may very easily be
understood what is intended. Farvvell.

THE SAFEGARDE FROM SHIP-WRACKE, OR HEAVENS HAVEN. Which is not to be attained
with out the Ship of S. PETER: TO WIT, The unity of the ancient Catholic
Church, whose faith therefore through all ages, as in a glass in here
presented unto you.
THE I. ARTICLE. The English Were converted a thousand years since to the
Catholic faith.
ONE thousand years since S. GREGORY then Bishop of Rome, converted us
Englishmen by the preaching of S. AUGUSTINE, from heathenish infidelity to
the faith of Christ.

S. BID terms this S. GREGORY, lib. ^. hist. cap. 2.
a man of immortal wit, who by his industry converted the English nation
from the power of Satan to the faith of Christ, etc. Saying there ye^ further
of him: [he is an Apostle to us, for we are the Seal of his Apostleship in our
Lord.]

M. Godwin says: in his catalog. of the Bishops of England. page 3.
[That blessed and boly Father Saint Gregory was the occasion of replanting the
Christian faith in our country.

M. Whitaker says: contra Duraum l. 5 p. 94
Gregory did us a great benefit which we will ever most gratefully remember.

M. Godwin terms this S. Austine: Ibid pa. 7
This our ^postle, In proose that our then conversion was in every particular
point the same with our now professed Cathol k faith: M. D. Humfrey says: in
Iesuit^mo par 2. rat. 5 p 5. and 617
[But what have Gregory and Augustine brought into the Church? a burden of
ceremonies etc. The Archbishops pall at sole^n^ mass time, purgatory, etc.
the offering of the healthful host of Christ's body and blood, and prayer for
the dead etc. relics, etc transubstantiation, etc. new consecrations of
Churches etc:] the like description is made of S. Gregory's Doctrine by in
Chron. lib 4. page 567. and 568.
Carrion.

Also John Ba^e affirms as much and says further with all, that in act. Romans
pontif. printed ad Basil. 1558 pa. 44. etc. Centur. 1. fol. 3.
[ S. Augustine was sent by Gregory to season the English Saxons with Popish
faith] and that King Ethelbert dyed one and twenty years after he had
received popery.

Luke Epitom. hist. ecclesiastica Cent 6 p. 289. and 290.
Oseander describes it yet more particulerly

This being so in his consut. of purgat page 333.
evident, M D. F^^k terms it therefore in general, our peruersion.

M Powell calls the same Saint Augustine, considerat. of the Papists
supplication page 34.
a false Apostle.

M.D willet places S. Gregory and S Augustine amongst [the in his Tetractylon
papism^ page 212.
first fathers of superstition, and captains or ringleaders of popih deuynes].

THE 2. ARTICLE. The same faith was universally professed for sundry ages
before, and was also agreeable to that first faith where unto the Brittans of
wales were converted in the Apostles times.
M John Napper in his page 6^.
treatise upon the reuelatio^s dedicated to his Majesty; says: Between the
year of Christ 300. and 316. the Antichristian and Papisticall reign began,
reigning universally and without any debatable contradiction 1260. years. And
a little further he says. [Euen 1260. page 145.
years the Pope and his clergy have possessed the outword visible Church of
Christians.]

With this account of M. Napper a greeth M. Brocard in his treatise upon the
revelations where he arfirmeth: fol. 110. and 1^3.
[That the Church was trodden down and oppressed by popery even from Pope
Siluesters time (an. 300.) unto these times.]

which deduction in this kind of our religion, up unto the Apostles age,
appears also yet further evident by conferring our foresaid confessed
religion taught us by S. Gregory and S. Austine with that primitie faith where
unto the Brittans of wales were confessedly converted in the Apostles time.

M. Camde^: says in his Britannia S page 4^. page 157.
[It is certain that the Brittans received the Christian faith in the very
infa^cie of the Church. in proof where of he there alleges sundry ancient
authorities. And a little further says. [In this Glaste^berie monastery
floristed, which has it origin or beginning from Joseph of Arimathia S. [for
this also do the most ancient monuments of this monastery testify neither
can we doubt of it]

M. Harrison in his description of Brittannie annexed to Hollens head his great
Chronicle of the last edition says: volum. 1 page 13. line 18.
[Ioseph preached here in England in the Apostles time, his Sepulcher in
Glastenburie, and Epitaph affixed thereunto, is proof sufficient.

M. Henoch Clapham speaking of the Brittans conversion in the Apostles times
says: in his Sovereign remedy against Schism page 24
our Schismatics may as well ask me what assurance I have, there was a king
Henry, as demand what assurance I have of the other.

MIVELL says: in his pag^ant of Popes.
The BRITAINS being converted by JOSEPH of ARIMATHIA held that faith at
AVSTINES coming.

For breuities sake. I omit many others, as D. FVLK, M. GODWIN, M. FOX, M.
MIDDLETON, etc.

An 724.
It is also evident even by S. BID himself, who lived so neete those times,
and vvrote the history thereof (as witnesses Chroni. ^le fo. 168
M. COVPER, and since acknowledged by many Protestans,) that upon conference
then had at a place called in S. BEDES time AVGVSTINE-IZAT between S.
AUGUSTINE and the BRITAIN Bishops, who at the first frovvardly resisted S
AUGUSTINE all that they could, for which M. FOX not unjustly reproves them.

S. BID says: hist lib 2. cap. 2.
AVSTINE using the help of king ETHILBERT, called the Bishops and Doctors of
the chiefest and nearest provinces of the Brittans to some conference in a
place called at this day in the English tongue AVGVSTINE-IZAT.

M. HOLLENSHEAD says: in his great Chron of the last edition volum. 1. l. 5.
cap. 21 page 102. line 23. 40.
The greatest difference then stood upon between AUGUSTINE and them, were
expressly and only mentioned to be certain (for that time) tolerable
differences: for S. BID reports how AUGUSTINE said to the BRITTANS: vbi sup.
if you will obey me in these three things, that is; to celebrate the Pasche
or Easter in it time, next, that you fulfill the ministry of Baptism, whereby
we are borne again to God, according to the custom of the Roman and
Apostolic Church: and that you will together with us preach the word of our
Lord unto the English nation; for all other things that you treat of (although
contrary to our customs) yet we will freely tolerate them.

The like is testified by vol. 1. p. 103. line 17.
HOLLINSHEAD, catalog. of Pops p. 6
M. GODWIN, and then lib. 3. cap 13. page 133. printed anno 1606.
PROTESTANT author of great BRITANNIE who says: The BRITAIN Bishops
conformed them selves to the doctrine and ceremonies of the Church of ROME with
out difference in any thing specially remembered, save only in the celebration
of the feast of EASTER etc. their dissent from the use of the Roman Church was
in their (ceremonies or) ministry of Baptism, and keeping of Easter, which
latre (as Osiander witnesses here follovving) was tolerated in l ke manner
by the Apostles in regard of the known weakness of some. Act. 16. v 3.
For the like respect circumcision was permitted by Paul, who circumcised
Timothy because of the Jews that were in that place* And a^^te beneath: cap
15.^9
abstinence from blood and that which was strangled and fornication was only
prescribed.

Osiander says. in Epitom cent. ^6, l 2. page 51.
John and Phillip did celebrate Easter decima quarta Luna post aequinoxium
vernum, at which time also the Jews were accustomed to celebrate their Easter
or Pasche; and this undoubtedly the Apostles did in favor of those Jews that
were newly converted unto Christ, that so they might also gain more Jews unto
Christ.

Now by this may well be collected their full agreement, for the Jews who
contradicted S. Austine, and that so earnestly about these few and smaller
points, would never have been silent, but much rather have with stood him in
the other, so many and incomparably much greater points of faith, had they in
like sort disagreed from him therein.

S. Bid says: hist. l. 2. cap. 2.
Then indeed the Brittans did confess themselves to understand, that to be
the true way of justice which Austine did preach.

M. Fulke affirms: confutation of Purgat p. 335. and Hollinshead vol. 1 pa

That Augustine did at last obtain the aid of the British Bishops for the
conversion of the English Saxons.

THE 4. ARTICLE. Our adversaries appeal unto the Fathers.
M. Iuell names S. Gregory that converted England for one of those fathers by
whom he will be tried, and with solemn acclamation protests saying: Sermon. at
Paul's cross.
o Gregory, o Austine, o Hierome, o Chrysostom, o Leo, o Dionysius, o
Anacletus, o Calixtus, o Paul, o Christ, if we be deceived, you have deceived
us. This you taught us, etc. And again, concerning no fewer then twenty and
seven several articles by him specially repeated in the same place, and in his
reply to M. Harding he does insist further saying: Vbi supra Psalm. 125.
as I said before, so say I now again, I am content to yield and subscribe, if
(See) any of our Learned adversaries, or if all the Learned men that be alive,
be able to bring any one sufficient sentence, out of any old Catholic Doctor
or father, or out of any old generale counsel etc. protesting with all that he
affirms thus much, Humfrey in his Ioannis Iuelli vita and mors an. 1573. page
123.
not as carried away with, heat of zeal, but as moved with the simple truth.

M. Whitaker, likewise thus confidently affirms saying: in resp ad rat cap
rat. 5. page 90.
The speech of M. Iuell was most true and constant, when provoking you to the
authority of the (first) six hundred years, he offered that if you could show
but any one clear and plain sentence out of any father or council, he would
grant you the victory. It is the offerre of us all, the same do we all
promise, and we will perform it.

Concerning M. Iuell, M. Hooker terms him: in his eccles policy lib 2. sect.

the Fathers in all points of faith, are for us and not for the Pope.

M Willet says: in An^. leg. etc. page 263, page 264.
I cale God to witness before whom I must tender an account etc: That the same
faith and religion which I defend, is taught and confirmed in the more
substantial points by those histories, counsels and fathers that lived
withim five or six hundredth years after Christ. And little further he blusheth
not to say: It is most notoriously evident that for the chiefest points of
Popery, as Transubstantiation, Sacrifice of the mass, worshipping of Images,
justification by works, the supremacy of the Pope, prohibition of marriage,
and such like, the (Papists) have noe show at all of any evident proof from
the Fathers, within five hundred years after Christ. Here I spare to speak,
he is so notorius, referring the most obstinate and blindest to that which
follows.

M. Field does confidently a verre of our so many Christian Catholic Churches
dispersed though the whole world, at Luthers first appearing, that they were
all of them. de eccles. lib. 3. page 7^, 76,
The true (Protestant) Churches of God, and that they which then believed those
damnable errors, which the Romanistes now defend, were a particular faction
only. These M.D. Field. All which considered prima front (as the say) at the
First sight, I may seem to have raised a Devil that I cannot get down a
gain, but by gods grace and your gentle patience I shall well discharge my
self of such a fiend.

THE 5. ARTICLE. Scripture is not easy to be understood.
Genesis cap. 22 v. 1.
GOD tempted Abraham Iam. 1. v. 13.
God tempts no man, Exodus 10 v 5.
I am the Lord thy God, mighty, ielous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children, upon the third and fourth generation: EZech. 18. v 10.
The soul that shall sin the same shall dye, the son shall not bear the
iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the
son. Act 9. v. 8.
Hearing the voice but seeing no man. ibid. 22. v. 10
They saw the light indeed, but the voice they heard not Matthew 5. v. 17.
so let your light shinne before men, that they may see your, good works: ibid
c 6. v. 1.
Take heed that you do not your justice before men. Hebr 9. v. 4
In the Arck was a goulden pot having Manna: ^ kings cap 8. v 4.
In the Arck was no other thing but two tables of stone.] Moreover [^. Peter
says 2 Peter cap. 3. v. 16
that in the Epistles of S. Paul, certain things are hard to be understood
which the unlearned and unstable deprave, as also the rest of the scriptures to
their own perdition.]

Also how hard and obscure are these sentences which here follow? 1. Peter 3.
v 19
[In the which spirit coming he preached to them also that were in prison,
which had been incredulus some time, when they expected the patience of God in
the day of More.] Again: 1. Cor 15 v. 29
[Otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead if the dead rise
not again at all] And: ibid ca. 3 v 15.
[But himself shall be saved yet so as by sier.] And: Romans cap. 10.6.
[But the justice which is of faith says thus, say not in thy heart who shall
asce^d into heaven that is to bring Christ down, or who descends into the
depth that is to call Christ again from the dead, but what says the
scripture! the word is nigh in thy mouth and in thy heart.

The Eunuch when Phillip the Deacon said unto him: Act. 8.3^.
[trowest thou that thou understand the things which thou read?]
answered and said: [how can I, unless some manshew me.]

Psalm. 118
David a King and Prophet after Gods own heart durst not read the law of God,
before he had craved the understanding of it from God.

Luc. c. 24 v. 17.2^.
Also the Apostles did not understand the holy Scriptures, before that our
Savior had openned their eyes.

Ephesians. c. 3. v. 10.
How obscure also is this Place of Scripture? [that the manifold wisdom of God,
may be notified to Princes and Potentates in the celestials by the church,
according to the prefinitio of worlds which he had in Christ Jesus our Lord]

Finally, if our common laws handling nothing but selling, buying, barganing,
and such common and usual matters, as are daily practiced by men, be so hard
and difficult, as they require great study to be well understood, and clients
will give great fees for lawyers counsel upon them, what shall we think of
Gods Laws? when as S. Basil says, hom. 1^. in Hexameton.
[the Scripture is heavenly inspired and nothing a bounding in it, no, there
cannot be found so much as one idle word] which also treat of deuyne and
supernatural things, far above man's teach and capacity, as of the trinity,
incarnation of the word, heavenly Sacraments, the nature of Angels, of the
operation of God in men's mynds, of eternal Predestination, and reprobation,
with many others of this kind.

Also who dare take upon him the explication of S. John's Apocalypse, which (as
S. Hierome says) has as many mysteries as words, or of David's psalms, so
obscure that all have been astonished at the^. I speak not of your new
inflamed Doctors, who are so ^ot of the spirit that they will not only out
strip S. Hierome, but all others; nor limite themselves to the difficulties of
S John's Apocalipse or psalms only, but even from Alpha to Omega, the first
word of Genesis to the last of the whole scriptures for they boldly affirm and
assure thee (who ever thou art) if thou have but says and the spirit, that
thou shall be, as sure of the true sense of scripture, as thou art sure thou
live, for what says Calvin? lib. 4. instit cap. 17 g. 25.
[truly that after diligent and serious meditation about the under standing of
these words: This is my body; he did embrace that sense which the spirit did
suggest. The same does Luther allege against Calvin, and Zuinglius against
them both; wherefore certainty it was a very soul and wicked spirit, that would
not inculcate one and the same doctrine, but thus grossly delude three such
pillars of your Church as these, setting them together by the ears: but indeed
I rather think it to be a Hebgobling then any spirit to interpret the holy
ghost, and so if you please for this present we will take it, as by all
liklihood most probable

But to our purpose, from which perchance we have to far digressed, for your
better satisfaction therefore, receive the consent of the primitive Church in
these few Doctors, at least concerning this one point, especially when as your
own confess that they Hooker l. 1. de eccles. politia sect. 4 p. 86 and l. 2.
s. ^4 page 102. See tradition.
cannot determine by Scripture what is Scripture. This I say, we must do,
unless we should imitate you in England, rejecting what mislykes us, and
admit only the rest, which makes not Scripture but only in concept

S Augustine says: tom. 6. de vtil. cred cap. 7
he that has no skill in Poetry, dare not meddle with Terentian Mauru^ with
out a master: Asper, Cornutus, Donatus, and infinite others are requisite to
understand any Poet, and do thou without a guide rush upon holy books full
of deuyne matters? O exceeding boldness or rather madness! And again If every art
though base and easy require a teacher or master to obteyn it what is more
foolish heady pride, then not to learn the book of deuyne Sacraments of their
interpreters. lib. de fide and bonis operidu^ ca. 15 16.
Also in another place he affirms that place of S. Paul And if any man build
upon this foundation etc. to be one of the most difficult places in the
epistles of S Paul.

Moreover as hom. 1. Cantica.
Origin vvriteth and S. in proemio EZechielis.
Hierome, the ancient fathers had such an opinion of the obscurity of
Scripture, that they would permit no man to read the beginning of Genesis and
end of EZechiel before he were thirty years of age.

S Austine whom our Adversaries so much extol, was of such admirable wit,
that not yet twenty years of age, with out any interpreter, or any man
teaching him did understand Aristotle's Categories as he confesses himself.
This best witness (I say according te Calvin) a man of so rare wit, did neither
think so highly of him self, nor basely of Scripture, that he would of his
own mother wit* give the true sense of Scripture, for thus he speaks:
epist. ad velusianu^
such is the profunditie (says he) of the Christian Doctrine, that I should
profit in it every day, if I would gu^e my self unto it with all diligence,
chiefest study, and best wit even from my childhood unto decrepit old age And
in an other place he says: lib. 3. confessionum cap. 5.
wherefore I purposed seriously with my self to read the holy Scriptures, there
by to see of what nature they were: and lo I behold a thing neither evidently
convicted to the proud, nor yet naked or manifest to children: but in style
lowly, in success lofty and veiled with mysteries. Again, lib. 2, doctrine.
Christi cap. 6.
But (says he) they are deceived with diverse and manifold obscurities and
ambiguities, who rashily read the Scriptures taking one thing for an other: in
certain places they do not find what they falsely suspect: for some things
are spoken so obscurely that they cast amost thick darkness, all which I nothing
doubt but that it is done by divine providence to tame pride with labor, and
to keep the understanding from lothing; which things that are easily
understood do offen times basly esteem of; And a gain: lib. 12. confessionum
cap. 14.
wounderfull (says he) is the profounditie of the Scriptures, or speeches,
whose outward appearance does seem unto us to flatter the simple, but
wou^derfull is the profunditie, o God, wou^derfull is the profounditie: it is a
horror to look into it, a horror of honor, a fear of Love. To conclude, last
of all he says: Epi. 119 cap. 21.
in the holy Scriptures are far more things which ^ know not: then which I
know, hitherto for Learning, sanctity, and Fidelity (even according to our
Adversaries) peerless Saint Augustine.

S Ruffinus lib. 2. hist. cap. 9.
Basil and S Gregory Nazianzen, both noble men, both broughtt up at Athens,
both companions for thirteen years together in one monastery; did bestow
their whole endeauours in reading the holy Scriptures and gathering the
understanding of them, not out of their own presumption, but out of the
writings and authorities of their elderes, who (as is manifest) had the rule
of their understanding from Apostolical tradition.

S. Ambrose says the devine Scripture is a Epist. 44 ad consta^tinum.
sea, having in it deep sentences, and obscurity of Prophetical riddles.

S. Hierome that miracle of understanding in the greek and Hebrew tongue says
of himself Epist. ad
I never ceased (Says he) [euen from my tender ago either to read, or to ask
learned men, such things as I did not know: neither did I ever take my self to
be my master: Finally not long since for this only cause, I went to Alexandria
to see Di^^ymus, and to be resolved by him of all such doubts, epist ad
A^g^s^^^n quaest. 8.
as I had in the holy Scriptures.] Again. [The whole epistle unto the Romanes]
(says he) [is overwhelmed with to many obscurities]

But now I know you are not with outsome euasions, and amongst many this is a
Chief one: [that although Scripture be obscure in many places, yet you w ll
have all, required unto salvation plain to every man] But I prove the
Contrary, for Baptism is necessary unto salvation, and not with standing
that place in S. John: cap. 3. v 5.
unless a man be borne again etc is so obscure, and does breed such cauil and
co^tentio^ between Calvin and Breni^^s that lib. 4. instit. cap. 16. v. 15.
Calvin does confound the spirit with the water, but in cap. 3. Matt.
Br^^^ius co^fou^deth both with penance.

Moreover the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, (which you call the Lords
John. c. 6 v. 51.
supper) is necessary to salvation, and not with standing it is a wou^der to
see how many, and diverse expositions their are upon these sower words: Matt.
26 v. 26.
This is my body. S Claudius Saints says that there [are fowescore and four
interpretatio^s invented by heretics upon them sower words only.]

Repet. 1. cap. 10.
Also justification is necessary and yet Luke Osiander (a chief protestant in
Germany) says: that there are twenty several opinions of it, where of every
one does challeng Scripture for that which it holds.

Finally, at least the belief of the Trinity, and incarnation of our Savior
is necessary unto Salvation, and yet notwithstanding who does not see how the
^bionites, Arians Nestoria^s Eutychias and valentinians do fight and contend
abo^nt it? and ^ast of all the new Arians and Eutychians of this our age, which
certainly they would never do if places of scripture which they have handled
necessary to. ^^^ation had been plain and easy to be understood: To
conclude, the only disobedie^s in not bilieuing the Catholi^. Church were
sufficient to condemn us, if we did credit our Saviors words who says:
Matt. 18. v. 17.
if he will not hear the Church let him be to thee as the heathen and
publica^] And that we might not doubt of the doctrine of this Church he says:
ibid. ca. 16 v 18. etc. 28. verse 20.
The gates of hell shall not prevail against her, and that he will remain
wi^h the^ (the Doctors of the Church) unto the end of the world.

But if you will yet object and say that you ca^ allege as firm and forceable
places of scripture in your behalf, as I have done in mine, or shall do heat
after, not with standing you may not presently co^clud against us, but rather
let us assure our selves, that the scripture cannot, nor must not be contrary
to it self, which to affirm and maintain, is blasphemy against the holy
ghost, and certe^ly our savior says: Matthew. 12. v. 32
[he that shall speak against the holy ghost, it shall not be forgiven him,
neither in this world, nor in the world to come] whereby the way we may
observe, that there is a place after this life where sins are forgiven, for
hell, I think you expect no absolution there. Purgatory, you abhor^e the name
of it, so foolist you think that opinion, but into heaven S. John says, There
S^^ll enter no polluted thing, not that does abomination and makes ^ye: To
close up this matter therefore with these few sentences: the first is Luthers;
who seeing that these words. This is my body do stand vmnoueable for the
Catholic, and under no color may be wrested to any other sense, he calls
the divine scripture [the book of heretiques] ( lib. 3. cont Bre^tium and
Alanus Copu^ dialogo 6. cap. 19.
as Hosius writes) And in an other place he says lib cent. Zuingliu^ and Ooec
olampaducem.
[^f this world (Says he) should long e^dure, it must needs be for the diverse
interpretations of scripture that now are extant, and that for the conservation
of the unity of faith, that we do receive again the decrees of counsels
and fly unto them for refuge]

The other sentence is of Vincentius Lirinensis who says lib cont. prefanas
haere^^m nouitate^. cap. 37.
[as often as heretics do allege the sentences of divine Law, by which
(being evil interpreted they labor to confirm their errors, there is no
doubt but they follow the crafty inventions of their author the devil; Again
when we see heretics use the Catholic faith. Let us not doubt but it is
the devil that speaks in them]

Now seeing the Scripture must have one true sense, let us be resolved by the
most probable authority, whether by the warrant of the primitive Church with
her doctors, or of Luther and Calvin upon their private spirit and some few
sectaries.

Easter. Concerning which there were many cou^cells, but at length the question
was so decided by Pope Victor, that who soluet after did not obey the Pope of
Rome, he was held for an heretic.

c In the third age, the Nouatian heresy was condemned by Pope Cornelius. Also

FATHERS.
S Ireneus who Lived an. Domini: 160. says: lib. 3. c. 2.
That controversies canduct be decides by only Scripture. And a little further:
Ibid. c. ^.
[That all the faith fu^e ought to have recourse and appeal unto the Pope of
Rome.]

S. Athanasius anno 340. says: [ in epist. ad solitarivitam age^^es.
When was it ever heard of, from the beginning of the world that the Church
should take the authority of her judgment from the Emperor, or when has this
ever been counted for judgment?

S Basil anno 80. says: Epistola ad Athanasium.
[That it did seem good unto him, to send to the Pope. of Rome, that he would
send some with authority into the East, to dissolve the acts of the Council
of] Ariminensis.

S Gregory Naz anno 380. in his oration wherein he accuses himself for
abstayning so Long from his acclesiasticall function, says, [you sheep, do
not you feed your pastors, neither lift your selves a boue there offices, for
it is sufficient for you that you be truly fed, nether judge your judges, nor
prescribe Laws to the law makers]

S. Cyrill anno. 350. says: in Thesauro (vt D. thocitat in opusculo de
erroribus Grec.
[wee ougth to stick to our head the Pope of Rome, it pertains unto all to
ask of him what to believe and what to hold]

S. Chrysostom anno. 380. says. homil. vlt. in Ioannem.
S. Peter is a master placed over the whole world by our Savior.

Tertullian anno 200 says. lib de praescript. haeret.
[That we ought not to dispute with heretics out of the Scripture, because
the true understanding of Scripture, is from the Catholic church; therefore
it ought first to be manifest, what is the true doctrine of the Catholic
Church, but this can by no means be better known then in the Churches of the
Apostles, the chiefest where of is the Roman Church.

S. Cyprian anno 240. says: lib. 1. epist. 1.
[that heresies and schisms spring from another cause, then because the priest
of God is not obeyed, nor one priest for the time in the church, and judge in
the place of Christ is thought on]

S Ambrose anno 380. Epist. 10
writing to the Eemperour Vale^t ne the younger who being corrupted by the
Arria^s, would judge of matters of faith, says: [But certainly if we observe,
either the order of devyne scripture or the course of ancient times who can
deny, but that Bishops in matters of faith (I say) in matters of faith were
wont to judge of Christian Emperors (that is of their faith) and not Emperors
of Bishops, (that is of their faith)? thy Father, a man of riper age) said: it
be longs not unto me to judge of Bishops: now thy clemency says I ought to
judge. Et infra. if there be-any thing to be handled concerning faith, that
conference does belong unto priests, as it was done under Constantine, a
prince of famous memory and heir of thy fathers dignity, but what has been
well begun is other wise co^summated. For Bisthops did first give the true
and sincere faith, but when some would judge of faith with in their palaces,
they did effect by circumuensio^, that the judgment of Bishops might be changed*

S. Hierome anno 380. says: in epist. ad Damasum.
(I beseech your holiness (the Pope) by Christ crucified, the salvation of the
world, by the holy trinity, that there be authority given me by your letters,
either that I council or affirm three Hypostases. And in an other place he
says: lib. 1. co^t, Iouin.
out of Twelve one is chosen, that a head being constituted occasion of Schism
might be taken away.)

S. Augustine anno 400 says: lib. 1. cont. Crescouium cap. 23.
whosoever does fear to be deceived through the obscurity of this question,
let him ask council of the Church, which the holy scripture does demonstrate
with out any ambiguitie or doubting. And again. cont. epist. fundamenti cap. 5.
But I (says he) would not believe the gospel if the authority of the church
did not compel me.

There be many more of this kind, which for breuities sake I omit, not doubting
but these may suffice, only receive this testimony from S. Austine, that these
fathers do not teach any new opinion or doctrine of their own, but what they
have received from the Apostles and primitive Church it self

lib. 2. cont. Iulianu^ Pelagianum.
(The ancient Fathers (says he) sought not frindship with us or you, nor yet
were at enmity with either of us: with us or you they were not offended,
neither did they pity either of us: but what they found in the Church, that
they held, what they had Learned, that they taught: what themselves had Learned
of their forefathers, the same they delivered to their children.)

For heretics alleging of authority or Scripture for the most part the
saying of S. Cyprian may suffice. de vnitate ecclesiae cap. 9.
O corruptor of the Apostle and false interpreter the first words thou put
down but omittest that which follows, as thou thy self art cut of from the
church, so thou cuttest away one sentence from one little chapter.]

Now (to omit all out Adversaries idle objections without any proof) the
Catholic thus proves his scripture. S. Austine says: de Doctr^n^ Christiana
l. 2 c. 8.
[the whose cannon of Scripture is contained in these books: The five books
of Moses etc. Job, Toby Hester, ^^h and the 2. books of Machabees, twoe
books of Es^^as etc and these 2. books, whereof the one is called wisdom, the
other Ecclesiasticus, for a certain similitude called the books of Solomon:
for it is most certainly affirmed that ^e^us the son of Syrach did write them,
which not withstanding because they are thought worthy of Authority they are
to be numbered amongst the Prophets: the rest are etc. these S. Austine] Also
the third council of Charthage (at which S. Austine was present) says Cinou.
47. See the like account by Innocent and in epist. ad Ex ^p^rum and Selasius

[it is thought good, that nothing be read in the Church under the name of
deuyne Scripture, besides the Canonical Scriptures, the Canonical scriptures
are Genesis, Exodus, Leuiticus, etc the five books of Solomon) etc. Toby,
Judith, Hester, 2. books of Esdras, 2 books of Machabees etc.

Whereas out Aduersaties object that Orige^ in eo ad Iuliu^ Articanu^
Origin hom. 1. in leuiticum
Epiphamus etc S. Hierome affirm the [Machabees; Ecclesiasticus Toby, and
other books of the old Testament to be Apocryphal,] it is answered there unto
first that the Fathers in those places do not speak of there own opinion, but
do only repeat what was the opinion of the Hebrews, and what books they
thought Canonical* these three Fathers do defend these books to be canonical.

Concerning Apol. 2. adu Ruffinum in Prolog
S. Hierome lie answers and explaineth himself saying, [truly I did not set
down what I thought, but what the Hebrews are accustomed to say against us
herein, calling there further Ruffinus Apol. 2. adu Ruffinum in Prolog
a foolish Sycophant for mistaking and charging him with the Hebrews opinion.
Also in another place he most expressly places the in Machab in praefat. in
books of Machabees (rejected by the Hebrews) [amonge the stories of Deuyne
Scripture. And in another place he says of Judith.
Judith: the book of Judith among the Hebrews is read among holy writing,
whole authority is not judged so sit to confirm things that are in contention
etc. but because the council of Nice is said to have reckoned this book in
the number of holy Scripture, I rest content etc.

Secondly it is evident that in the primitive Church, the canonical Scriptures
were not generally received all at once, but in so great variety of pretended
Scriptures, sundry books were for the time misdoubted, or by some Fathers and
Councels omitted or not received which yet afterward upon better search and
consideration they were generally acknowledged.

To conclude this point, hear M. Bilson Lord Bishop of W^nchester saying: in
his Survey of Ch^ists sufferings etc. anno 1604. page 664.
[the Scriptures were not fully received in all places, no not in Eusebius
time. he says that the epistles of James, Jude, the 2. Peter and 2. John are
contradicted, as not written by the Apostles, the epistle to the Hebrews was
for a while contradicted etc. the Churches of Syria did not receive the 2
Peter, nor 2. John, the epistle of Jude nor the Apocalypse etc. the like might
be said for the Churches of Arabia: will you hence therefore conclude that
these parts of scripture were not Apostolical, or that we need not receive
them now, because they were formerly doubted off, etc] so fully does M. Bilson
answer our Adversaries like usual objections against the Machabees, and the
other books of the old testament now in question. But the authority of the
Church only (as is by our Adversaries confessed) might satisfy us, at least in
this point; for M. Jewel says: defense 1. of his Apolog. page 201. and edition
an. 1571. page 241.
the church of God had the spirit of wisdom, whereby to discern true scripture
from false; the protestant author of the scripture and the church (whom
Bullinger so greatly commends in his preface thereof to the reader) does
affirm, Cap. 15. fol. 71 71. and cap. 16 fol. 74. 75.
[that we could not believe the gospel, were it not that the church taught
us, and witnessed that this doctrine was delivered by the Apostles.]

THE X, ARTICLE. The protestants pretense of only Scripture is frivolous and
idle.
In his Survey etc page: 219.
It has ever been the common practice and, deceit of almost all Nouellistes,
to pretend only scripture vsinge it as their last and only refuge, thereby to
continue their contentions, and to exempt themselves from all other final
judgments whatsoever. In- this sort Beza himself is noted to euade, witness
M. Bancroft. Saying a How Beza [discrediteth himself, saying, if any man
shall oppose against my exposition, the authority of certain fathers, I
appeal to the word of God] whereupon M. Bancroft infers saying; how
cranke is Beza with the ancient fathers?

The Brownists of Amsterdam say to M. Balsons allegations from the fathers [
Apology print 1604. page 103.
Let M. Bilson with these Doctors know that unless they can prove by the word of
God their Prelacie etc. all the color they bring out of former times and
writers, is of no moment in this case.]

M. Hooker says of the Eccl: policy in his preface page 38.
Anabaptiste; the book of God they, for the most part so admired, that other
disputation against their opinions, then only by allegatio^ of scripture, they
would not hear.

^b: de Christ natura page 2.
In this sort does Socinus a protestant, against volanus his protestant
adversary, give the stipp in defense of his error against the divinity of
Christ saying; To what purpose should I answer that which thou borrowest from
the Papists etc. especially where thou opposest to us the perpetual Consent
of the Church: very exellently doubtlese in this behalf has Hosius (the
Papist) [discoursed against you, wounding you with your own sword, and
therefore you are no less saf in urging against me the Churches perpetual
consent, then are the Papists in their urging thereof both against you and us:
And alitle further he says Page 222.
we set before us in this Question concerning the divinity of Christ, none
for Master, or interpreter, but only the holy Ghost etc. for we do not think
that we are to stand to the judgment of any man, though never so learned of
any Counsel, though in show never so holy and lawfully assembled, of any
visible Church, though neueuer so perfect and universal: Even Volanus him
self disputing against the Jesuits, is forced to make use of the examples,
sayings, and deeds of Athanasius, Hierome, Augustine, Theodoret, and other
fathers, whose authority he now opposes against us, as sacred: Thus much have
I thought good to remember, that Volanus may rereaue answer from him self
when he so often infers against us, the authority of learned me^ and
Consent of the Church.] Thus far Socinus. Insomuch that A certain Englih
protestant author of the treatise entitled A brief answer to certain
objections against the descentio^ of Christ into hell, printed at Oxford by
Joseph Barnes, where he says, and reproves this other protestant brother
saying: (where you saywe must build our faith one the word of faith, tyinge us
to the scripture only, you give just occasion to think that you neither have
the auntict fathers of Christ's Church, not their sons succeding the^,
agreeing whith you in this point, which implies a defense of some strange
Paradox: these likewise he.) This kind of tergiuersation under pretense of only
scripture is and has been so infinitely tedious to protestants them selves
and, so evidently the only means, whereby to uphold all their dissentions,
yet daily renewinge and vprisinge, that M. Hooker faieth; M. preface of his
Ec. po icie. lect: 6. page 28. 29.
^era in his last book but one, professes him self to be now weary of such
Combats and encounters, whether by word or writing, in so much that he
finds, that Controversies are thereby made but braules and therefore wishes
that in some common lawful asse^bly of Churches, all these thyftes may be at
once decreed.

shall at any time grant any.

M Hocker says again; Hooker. vbi supra page 26.
[what success God may give to any such kind of conference or disputation we
cannot tell, but we are right sure of this that Nature, scripture, and
experience have all taught the world to seek for the endinge of co^tentions by
submitting it self to some judicial and definitive sentence where unto
neither part that contendeth may under any pretense refuse to stand. And a

The will of God is to have the^ do whatsoever the sentence of a judicial and
final decision shall determine, yea though it seem in their private opinion
to swerve utterly from that which is right etc and that without this it is
impossible we should avoid confusion or ever hope to attain peace. And
certainly our adversaries hearein do but according to the wholesome admonition
of S. Austine saying: The verity of scripture is holden of us when we do
that which pleases the universal Church, which the authority of the same
scripture commends, and a little after he says, Austine tom. 7. lib. 1. cap
33.
whosoever fears to be deceived in the obscurity of this question, let him
ask council concerning it of the Church which the holy scripture points
unto, whout any ambiguitie.

M. Whitaker acknowledges that the question concerning canonical scripture,

not by testimony of the spirit, which says he, being private and secret, is
unfit to teach and resell others (But as he confesses by ecclesiastical
tradition. An argument (says he) whereby may be argued and co^uinced what
books are canonical and what are not]

The Protestant author of the treatise of the authority of the scripture and
the Church (whom Bullinger in his preface before the same book, so highly
commends, doubts not to say with S. Austine and Tertullian [we the
protestant etc. c. 15. page 74 75.
could not believe the Gospel were it not that the Church taught us, and
witnessed that this doctrine was delivered by ^he Apostles. This treatise was
translated out of latin into English by John Tomkins and printed 1^79.

which does or possible can ass^re us that we do well to think it is h s word;
for if any one book of the scripture d^d give testimony of all, yet still that
scripture which gives credit to the rest would requier an other scripture to

THE 11. ARTICLE. Protestants disagreeing translations.
M. Bruges says. Apology sect. 6
[That the approved Protestant translation, has many omissions, many additions
which some time obscure, some time pervert the sense.

M. Carle^^, in his book, that Christ went not down to hell, having
discovered many faults in the English Bibles, infers. page 116. and 241.
[That the English Protestants in many places detorte the Scriptures from
their right sense and show themselves to love darkness more them light, falsehood
more then truth they have corrupted and depraved the sense, obscured the
truth, deceived the ignorant, and supplanted the simple.

M. Broughten also, one of the chiefest linguistes in England, in his epistle
to the Lords of the privy Council, desires them to procure speedily a new
translation, o because that (says he) which is now in England is full of
errors. And in his Advertisement of corruptions to the Protestant Bishops he
says: [That their Public translation of Scriptures into English is such, as
it peruerteth, the text of the old testament in fouer hundred and forty eight
places, and that it causes Millions of Millions to reject the new testament,
and to run to eternal flames.]

in his translation of the new testament part 11. folio 110.
Charles Molineus says, That Calvin in his harmony (makes the text of the
gospel to leap up and done, as the truth it self declares, he uses
violence to the letter of the gospel and in many places clean tra^sposeth it,
and besides this he adds to the text.) These he.

Zuinglius after detection of many corruptions in Luther, concludes thus: (See
how thy case stands (Luther) that in the eyes of all men, thou art seenne to
be a manifest and common corrupter of holy Scripture, which thing thou can
never deny before any creature, how much are we ashamed of thee, who hitherto
have esteemed thee beyond all measure, and now try thee to be such a false
fellow?) these he.

Castalio says: That to note all the errors of Beza in tra^slating the new
testament, the work would require to great a volume.

In the fume of the conference before his majesty page 46.
The king thinks the Geneua translation to be the worst of all other.

M. Parkes in his Apology of three testimonies of Scripture concerning
Christ's desce^ding into hell, in his defense of the first testamonie says to
M. D. W^llet: As for the Geneua Bibles, it is to be wished that either they may
be purged from those manifold errors, which are both in the text and in the
margent, or else utterly pr^hibited.

In A Treatise entitled. A petition Directed to her most excellent majesty:

In so much as they do therefore profess the rest to be doubtful whether a man
with a safe conscience may subscribe thereto.

The Ministers of Lincoln Diocese, term the English translation. (A
translation that takes away from the text; that adds to the text and that
some times to the changing or obscuring of the meaning of the Holy Ghost,) Also
calling it, (A translation which is absurd and senseless, perverting in very
many places the meaning of the holy Ghost.) Not without cause therefore did his
Majesty affirm that he could never yet see a Bible well translated into
English. See the Sum etc. vt supra.

The Catholic translation acknowledged for the best.
BEza says of S. Hierome. in cap. 1. S. Lucae v. 1.
(The old interpreter (says he) seems to have intetpreted the holy books
with marvelous sincerity and religion. And in another place: Praef. noui test.

the vulgar translation I do for the most part embrace and prefer before all
others.

(M. D. Humfrey says also of S. Hierome: de ratione interpretat lib. 1. page
74.
The old interpreter (says he) seems sufficiently bent to follow the
propriety of words, and he does it in deed to carefully, which
notwithstanding I suppose him to have done, not of ignorance, but out of
religion and conscience: page 179.
) Which is no fault as M. Humfrey himself testifies in the same place saying.
(In Profane writings a man may rainge more freely and depart from the words,
in Canonical Scripture no such license is tolerable, for it is not lawful for
man to alter the tongue of God.) These he.

( Carolus Molinaus in Luc. 17.
professes to prefer the vulgar translation or edition before Erasmus,
Bucer, Bullinger Brentius, the Tigurine translation, also before John Calvin
and all others.

That famous Protestant writer, Conradus Pelicanus, says. ( in praefat. in
psalterium anni 15^4.
We find the vulgar edition of such excellency, learning, and to agree with
the Hebrew truth touching the sense, that I do not doubt, but the greek and
Latin interpreter were most learned, yea most pious, and of a true Prophetical
spirit.

M. Whit^ker having changed his former vehement style else where against S.
Hieromes translation says in his answer to M. Reynoldes: page 214,
S. Hierome I reverence, Damasus (the Pope) I commend, and the work I confess
to be godly and profitable to the Church.

in his answer to M B^uges etc page 94
M. D. Cauell says: (the vulgar translation was used in the Church one
thousand and three hundredth years since, and doubts not to prefer it
before all others. In so much that whereas the English translations are many
and among themselves disagreeing, he concludes, that of all those, page 91.

more forceable (as S Austine observes) to wringe out confession then any rack
or torment.

To conclude therefore, although we should grant them to have agreed upon some
one translation, yet their disagreement in the sense thereof is far greater,
And as page 5^.
(M. D. Reynoldes says in his conference with M. Heart, It is not the show, but
the sense of words (of Scripture) that must decide controversies.

And S Hierome says: in Epist. ad Talat.

The Church of the living God, is a pillar and fountion of truh.

Luc. 1.3^.
There shall be no end of his kingdom)

Here we must confess, either that these things shall be performed hereafter,
or have bine already, or god is to be accused of alye. If you answer that they
have bine performed, I demand when? if you say in the Apostles time, I demand
how it chauceth, that neither then the knowledge of God and true religion was
altogether perfect, and afterward in so short aspace vanished away, which was
promised to be eternal, and so abundant, that it should suck the milk of
other nations, and that the sound or doctrine thereof should spread unto all
parts of the erath (as indeed you all say and earnestly maintain) the Messiah
which should plant this Church (according to you) is not yet come and
consequenly our Sauiout was not the true Messiah, but that our Savior was the
true Messiah, and did once plant his true Church, you deny not, that this
Church cannot err I have proved, that it has not erred I prove manifestly by
all that which follows.

M. D. Couell says in his defense of the Hookers five books art 4 etc. Page
31.
(It is not the word of God which does, or possibly can assure us that we do
well to think it is the word of God: the first outward motion leading me^ so to
esteem of the scripture, is the authority of Gods Church, which teaches us
to receive Marks Gospel who was not an Apostle, and to refell the gospel
of Thomas, who was an Apostle, and to retain Lukes gospel, who saw not
Christ, and reject the glospell of Nicodemus that saw him.

M Fulk says in his answer to a Cou^terfayt Catholic Page 5. The same says
M. VV^^^^ adu. Stapl. l 1 c 5. p. 69 and M. Iuell in his def. of Apolog. an
1571. p 242.
That the church has judgment, to discern true wictinges from counterfayt,
and the word of God from the writings of men, and that this judgment she has
not of her self but of the holy Ghost.)

Peter Martyr says. Peter Martyr in his common places in English part. 1. c.
6. sect. 8. page 42. Matt. 28.20. John 9416.
[wee acknowledge it to be the function of the Church, that seeing it is endued
with the holy Ghost, it should discern the true and proper books etc; we
grua^t in very deed, that the ancient Church had such a boundance of the
spirit, as thereby they easly knew which of those that were presented unto them
were the true and proper words of God.

Now certainly if the Church had this true spirit of the holy Ghost, (as Peter
Martyr confesses) our Savior promises that it shall remain which her unto
the worlds end, and perco^sequence cannot, nor has not erred, which yet
further is made more evident by the sequel,

THE 13. ARTICLE. The Church does consist of good, and badd.
Matt. 3.12.
He shall make clean his flore, and shall gather his wheat into his Barn,
but the chafe he will burn with vnquenceable fire.

Ibid. ^. 13.30.
Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of harvest I will say
to the mowers, gather ye first the Cockell, and bind them in bundles, and
burn them, but the wheat gather ye into my barn etc. v. 39.
The harvest is the end of the world etc. v. 49.
so shall it be in the consummation of the world, the Angles shall go forth,
and shall separat the good from the badd.

Matthew. 1.
Read but this whole Chapter and I doubt not but you will be satisfied in this
point.

THE 14. ARTICLE. The Church is, and ought to have been always visible.
Machabaeas cap. 4
IN the later days there shall be prepared the mountain of the house of the
Lord and placed on high upon hills.

Esaie 60. page 20.
Thy sun shall no more go down, nor thy moon leese her light, for our Lord
shall be thy light which shall continue forever.

Act. 20.28.
Attend unto your selves, and unto the whole flock over which the holy Ghost
has placed you Bishops to govern the church.

Matthew. 5.15. lib. de unit. eccl. c. 14.
A City placed upon a hill cannot be hidd: This place and diverse others S.
Austine expounds to be meant of the church.

Matt. 18.17.
Tell it unto the church etc. [now if the church be not visible, how can we
tell the church which is not to be found.]

Ibid. 16.18. See also Romans 10.14. And Esaie cap. 61.9.
And upon this Rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not
preuail against her. [But certainly the Duiell has prevailed, and that in a
large measure, if at any time (according to you) the Church has bine so
obscure, that she could not be found, whereby poor souls might be received
into it.

FATHERS.
in psalm. 30. con. 2.
S. Austine says: The Prophets have spoken more obscurely of Christ, then of
the church, I think it was because they did see in spirit, that men would make
divisions, or inventions against the church; and would not have so great strife
about Christ, as be ready to raise up great contentions concerning the church,
therefore, that, from whence greatest contention would a rise, was more plainly
fore told, and manifestly prophesied of.

homil. 30. in Matthaeum.
Origin says: The church is full of light even from the East to the west etc.

hom 5. in 6. Esaie.
S. Chrysostom says: It is easier for the sun to be extinguished, then the
church to be darkened or made obscure.

lib. 3. co^tra epist. Permeniani c. 5.
S. Austine says: There is no security of unity, but out of the promises of
God, the church being made manifest* and as is said, placed upon a mountain,
cannot be hidd.

And again: tract. 1. in epist. Ioa^nis.
my brethren, do we show the church with our finger? is she not manifest.
And again: tract. 2.
what shall I say more, how blind are they, that see not so great a mountain,
that shutt their eyes against the light put on a candlestick? Also again:
psalm. 47.9.
upon this place of the psalm (God has founded it forever) he writes thus.
But perhaps that city (speaking of the church) which has held, up the world,
shall be some time over whelmed? God for bid, God has founded it forever, if
therefore God has founded it forever, why fear thou least the sky should
fall? And disputing against the Donatistes, who said that the whole visible
church was perished, and remained only in Africa (as you now say, in England)
amongst certain just persons only, says thus: in psalm. 101. concious 2.
But that church which was over all nations; is now no wheare, she has
utterly perished, this they say who are not in her. Oh impudent voice; she is
not because thou art in her, but beware least thou therefore be not: for she
shall be although thou be not [And afterward he brings in the church
speaking thus: How long shall I be in this world? tell me for their sake that
say, she was, but is not now, the church has played the Apostata, and is
perished from among all nations: and he told me: behold I am with you even to
the end of the world. And again: tom. 6. cont. Faustum Maniih. l. 13. cap. 13.
for these motives, or sauegarde of little children which may be seduced by me^
from the manifest clearnes of the truth, our Lord also providing said, a city
placed upon a mountain cannot be hid. And again: let it be (says he) that
from hence the true Church is hidden to None, where upon that is grounded which
he says in the Gospel, a City placed upon a hill, cannot be hid, and
therefore he adioyneth in the psalm: I have put my tabernacle in the sun,
[that is in the open view.] These S. Augustine.

From the Adversary.
Calvin and M. Whitaker say: Call. inst. pr. at Geneua 1450. c. 8. de fide f. 37

The Church can never want Pastors and Doctors. And certainly there can be no
Pastor with out some known flock.

M Fuike says, [That Christ will suffer no particular Church to continue with
out a servant to over see it, and that Pastors and Doctors must be in the
Church till the end of the world, even from Christ's time to Luthers age]

M. Spark says: in his answer to M. John Albines page 11.
[The Church of Christ has always had, and shall have to the end,
successively in all ages in one place or other, such as have showed the truth
fully unto others, and have shined as lights in their days set upon a
Candlestick.

M Fuike says again in his answer to a counterfeit Catholic p. 100.
truth cannot be continued in the world, but by ministry.

Also in page 845.
Certain propositions and principles disputed in the university of Geneua it
is concluded, that the ministry is an assentiall mark of the true Church.

M. Deering says: upon the epist. to the Hebrews ca. 3 lectur 15. and 16.
[Salvation springs in preaching of the Gospel, and is shutt up a gain
with ceassing of it. And a little further he says: Take away preaching and you
take away faith.] for which he cites many scriptures

And M. Fulk says yet vbi supra page 11 92
[That these Church Pastors (at least some of them) shall always resist all
false opinions, Even with open reprehension.]

Also M. D^ering says: vbi s^pra c. 2. v. 12. lect 10 and 3. lect. 12.
[The Religion being of God no fear of man shall keep them back, because (as
M. Deering says) that were to keep the honor of God for Cornets and solitary
places, for as the Apostle prescribes: Romans 19.10.
z with the heart aman belieueth unto righteousness, and with the mouth
confesses to salvation.]

See Beza in his sermons upon the Canti^les Englished p. 79. 80.
Our Puritan Adversaries acknowledge and teach that there must be Pastors and
Doctors to the end of the world for the administration of the word and
Sacraments. 1 Cor. 11.29.
For we are thereby to show the Lords death till he come.

M. Whitaker says, speaking to this end of the administration of the word and
Sacraments. contra Dureum l. 3. page 249. and
[That being present they constitute a Church, and being abse^t, do subvert it.
260.
And that they are essential notes of the true Church]

M. Willet says likewise of them: [These marks a cannot be absent from the
Church, and it is no longer a true Church, then it has these marks, for
(says he) the only absence of them does make a nullity of the Church]

Hiperius, and Amandus Polandus affirm; that [these notes are needful to
distinguish the true Church from the false; that me^, careful of their
salvation, may know where the true Church is, and to which company chiefly they
ought to adioyne themselves.]

Bartholomaus Keckermannus says: [the Church of the new testament ought
always to be sensible and manifest by notes and external form, that the
other Gentiles which are yet without the Church, may know unto what Church to
adioyne themselves, which Es^y foretold of the Church of the new testament in
most excellent words saying. Esaias c. 61. v. 9.
They shall know their seed in the Gentiles, and their budd in the mids of
peoples: all that shall see them shall know them, that these are the seed which
the Lord has blessed.]

M. Henoth Clapham after many proofs alleged by himself from the scriptures
and otherwise, concludes saying: in his sovereign remedy against schism page
18. and 17.
[Not only all ancients ever held the Churches ever visibility, but also all
learned men of our age: And again: Contrary to all scriptures they affirm,
that there has been no vibisility of the Church for former hundredth years
which position is against psalm. 72.3.17. and Esaias 59.21. And again: Matthew. c.
24. v. 23.24.26.
Our Savior for bides (says he) all going out unto such desert and Corner
Ghospellers.

Calvin says. Instit. l. 4 c. 2. sect.
That salvation, or entry into life is (in or) by this visible church. And
again: q. 22.
This benefit (so wit, of remission of sins) is so proper unto the church,
that we cannot other wise enjoy it, but by remaining in the communion of it,
therefore let every of us think this to be his duty, not to seek for
remission of his sins elsewhere, but where the Lord has appointed it, to wit,
in the visible church. These Calvin yet further he says: ^. 10.
So great account does the Lord make of the communion of his church, that he
shall be held a traitorous turn coat, and forsaker of religion, whosoever
disobediently alienates himself from the Christian society, whence it
follows, that the departing from the church, is the denying of God and
Christ, and therefore so much the more must we be ware of such kind of
disagreement, or breach of faith, neither can there be a more heinous crime
imagined, then which sacrilegiously, to violate that wedlock, which the only,
be gotten son of God vouchsafed to contract with us. These he.

Melanchthon says: in Council. Theolog Part. 2. and page 293. and 344.
It must needs be, that we confess a visible church: And again: what
means this monstrous assertion, which denies there is any visible church?

M D. Hamfrey says: in Iesuitismi part. ^ rat. 3. page 140
It is made manifest, we do not place the church in the air but one the
earth that we confess the church to be a town seated up a Matt. 5.
hill which cannot be hidd. Esaias. 2.
The high mountain of the house of God, higher then all hills, unto which all
nations shall fly etc. therefore why do they so earnestly labor to prove what
was never denied by us? etc. And again: page 141.
The church is visible by the exercises of piety, which are seen of all in
the church, for whilst the ministers teach, others do learn; they administer
the Sacraments, these (laity) communicate etc he which sees not this is more
blind then a mole; she is visible, because her signs are excellent and
manifest etc page 242.
secret a boades are not the Christian convocation etc because this communion
of Saints, is an open testification of Christianity.

M. Field says. lib. 1. de Ecclesia c. ^0 page 19.
The persons of them, of whom the church consists are visible, their
profession known even to the Profane and wicked of the world, The same
confessat^ melanctho^ in loc. comun edi^
and in this sort the church cannot be invisible. And again: it is true that
Bellarmine labors in vain, in proving that there is, and always has been
a visible church, and that, not consisting of some few scattered Christians
with out order of ministry or use of Sacraments, for all this we do most
willingly yield unto, howsoever perhaps some few have been of opinion that etc.
And again he says: 1561. c. de eceb page 324.
lib. 3. de Ecclesia. cap. 6. page 72.
It is most fond and frivolous that some demand of us where our church was
before Luther began? for we say it was, where now it is. If they ask us,
which? we answer it was the known and apparent church in the world, wherein
all our fathers lived and dyed, wherein Luther and the rest were Baptized etc.
(And most exceeding bouldhy he there further says) none of the points of
false Doctrine and error, which they now mayntaine and we condemn, were the
Doctrines of that church etc. Also he proceeds yet further with like
incredible bouldnes and says: Ibid. lib 3. cap. ^ page 76.
we most firmly believe all the churches in the world wherein our fathers lived
and dyed, to have been the true (Protestant) churches of God, in which
undoubtedly salvation was to be found, and that they which taught, embraced,
and believed those damnable errors, which the Romanistes now defend against
us, were only a particular faction etc.

To all which that may be a sufficient answer which follows, neither is it
any marvel if our adversaries doubt not to make undue and pretended claim to
the ancient fathers, seeing they blush not to affirm thus exceeding bouldly
and untruly of the time in which Luther first began, which is yet within the
memory of this present age.

The Protestants chief growndes for their visible Church taken from VValdo,
VViclyffe, and Husse etc. Confuted.
VValdo was first a Catholic and no Protestant. Anno 1220.
Act. in on page 628.
M. Fox testifies of him that [he was a Catholic layman, arich Merchant of
Lions in france, and so unlearned, that he gave rewards to certain learned
men to translate the holy scriptures for him, and certain other works of the
Doctors.] And being thus helped (as M. Fox reports) he conferred the form of
religion in his time, to the infallible word of God [where upon (says page 41.
M. Fox) sprunge up the Doctrine and name of those which are called waldensis
Anno 1218. And again he says: page 45.
that his followers were so unlearned likewise, that some of them expounded the
words of S. John. John cap. 1.
Sui non receperunt eum. Swyne did not receive him.

Luther says of the Waldenses: in Ioachim Cameratius de frattun. Orthodox.
Eccle^^is etc. page ^75.
[They had that fault, that because they would avoid the subtilties and
Craftines of Sophisters and Monks, they did altogether abstain from all
study of arts.] And a little before he says: many of them indeed had never
at any time seen the holy Bible, here it is evident that he was first no
Protestant.

VVicklyffe Anno 1370.
M. Stowe says: Annals of England printed Are 1592. page 464. and 465.
[he was a Catholic priest and parson of Lutterworth in licestershire, And
that he first inueyed against the church, for that he had been deprived by the
Archbishop of Canterbury from a certain benefice.

M. Fox says Act, mo^, psg, 85.
he was our country man, and that out of all doubt, all the world was in a
most desperate and vile estate, and that lamentable ignorance and darkness of
Gods truth had over shadowed the whole earth, when John Wicklyffe stepped forth
etc. as the morning star in the midst of a cloud. And again page 391. line
60. printed An. 1596.
that in the times of horrible darkness when there seemed in a manner to be no
one so little spark of pure doctrine left, or remaining, Wickliffe by Gods
providence, rose up, through whom the Lord would first awaken and rail up
again the world etc.

M D. Humfrey says: in vita Iulli printed at london. 1573. page 263. Epist.
hist. Eccles. cent. 6.10.11. page 439
Our John Wicklyffe was almost the first trumppet er of this Gospel in these
latter days.

Osiander says k The books of Wicklyffe are not pure in all things, for he
had not men in those times, that might brotherly admonish hime, if he should
go beyond his limits.

Of all the horrible gross errors which he held, the Protestant doctrine of
Justification by faith only, was so unknow unto him, that as Waldensis (who
lived in the same time with him) affirms, he exceeded in the contrary,
defending humane merits as the damnable heretic Pelagius held them: In so
much that Melanch^hou says of him. in epist. ad frideric Micon. in lib. epist.
Zuinglij. and Occolompadi^. Page 622.
Verily he did not understand, nor hold the justice of faith. And in the same
place he doubts not to say of him. I have found him in many other errors,
whereby one may judge of his spirit. Here also it is evident that he was first
no Protestant.

John Husse Anno 1400.
M. Jacob says in his defense of the Church and ministers of england page 13.
Luther in collog. German^cis. cap. de Antichristo.
(being he was a Catholic priest) [that he said Mass even to his dying day.]
And was so Catholickly resolved in other points of faith, that Luther says n
The Papists burned John Husse when as yet he departed not a fingers breadth
from the Papacy, for he taught the same which the Papists do, only he- found
fault with their vices and wicked life, against the Pope he committed nothing.

M. Fox says: M. Apoc cap. 11. page 290.
[what did Husse at any time teach, or defend in the counsel wherein he did not
rather seem superstitiously to consent with the Papists? what did the Papish
faith decree concerning transubsta^tiation which he Likewise with the Papists
did not confirm? who Celebrated mass more religioussie then he? etc. what
therefore shall we say he has co^mtted for which he is not together with the
Roman Sea to be absolved.] And again, speaking of his followers he says Act.
mo^. page 260.
[The Bohemia^s being demanded in what points they did differ from the church
of Rome, the only propositio^s which they there upon propunded were these fouer
Articles, first the necessity of Communion under both kinds, which point
Protesta^tes acknowledge to be but a matter of indifferency. See Mel. in
Centur. epist Theolog. page ^52. and Jewel in his reply page 110. 106.
Melanchthon, and M. Iuell, The Second; [that all civil dominion was forbidden
to the clergy. The third that the preaching of the word is free for all me^,
and in all places. The fourth, that open crimes are in no wise to be suffered
for avoiding of greater evil. So evidently also did the Bohemians in all other
points of says embrace the Catholic Doctrine.

Here it is manifest that these were first no Protestants, wherein our
Aduersaire could place his ever visible church, besides, being thus (as they
afferme) called to the preaching of the word extraordinarily, they were (as
learned Protestants write) to confirm their new doctrine by signs and
Miracles. And for this cause M. Henoch Sovereign remedy against Scisme pa. 25.
Clanpham reprehended Broune, in that he took upon him an extraordinary calling
and wanted miracles.

Luther did Admonish to this end sayng: in loc co^. class. 4. c. 20. Page ^8.
search whither they can prove their vocation: for God has not any time sent
any man, unless called by man, or declared by signs; no not his only son.
And again he says: tom. 5. Ion. Germ. fol. 498.
from whence come thou? who sent thee etc where are the signs, that thou ar^
sent by men where are the miracles, that should testify that thou art sent
from God?

Adu. Anabpt. l. 3. c. 7.
Bullinger says to the Anabaptists: if you say you have, like the Apostles a
peculiare vocation, prove it by signs and miracles (as they did etc.) but this
you will never do, therefore your vocation is of no whorth, yea it is pernicious
to the church of Christ. See also this saying alleged to this end by M. Tho
Bell in his x Regiment of the church. page 137.


Neither can Luther or any of our adversaries prove their own vocation by this
lawful and absolute testimony of signs and miracles, wherefore this so
confessed probation may fitly serve a against themselves, as for any ordinary
mission; certainly they can show none, at least to preach false Doctrine, or
contrary to that, which gave them authority.

But perceauing their weak grounds for their visible church, they fly with
tooth and nail to an invisible church, though quite contrary to all scripture
and what they hadd formerly taught.

The Protestants invisible Church.
M. Parkins says: upon the creed page 400. and in his reformed Caholick pa.
1229 and page ^07.
we say that before the days of Luther for many hundredth years an universal
Apostasy over spread the whole face of the earth and that our church was not
then visible to the world. And he gives the reason saying: During the space of
Nine hundredth years the Papish heresy spread it self over the whole earth.

M. Fulke says. In his answer to a counterfaite Cath. page 16. M. Nappe upon
the Revelations page 145. col. 5. page 191. 161 col. ^. and page 106 and 2 7 and
2 ^ebast. in epist. de abroga^dis in vniuersum omnibus statutis Ecclesiasticis.
The church remained invisible a long season after. Anno Domini 607.

M. John Napper says: That the Pope and his clergy has possessed the outward
visible Church of Christians 1260. years, Gods true Church most certainly
abiding so long time latent and invisible.

Sebastianus Fra^cus affirms, that [for certain, through the work of
Antichrist the external church, together with the faith and Sacraments,
vanished away presently after the Apostles departure, and that for these
thousand four hundredth years, the church has been no where external and
visible.]

M. Bround says: Upon ye Reave. fol. 110.
[That the church was trodden down and oppressed by the Papacy, even from
Siluesters time unto these times, which he collecteth to be 1260. years,]

M Jewel says: [The truth was unknown at that time, and unheard of, when
Martyn Luther and Zuinglius first came unto the knowledge and preaching of the
Ghospell]

Bucer says. Upon ye Reave. fol. 110.
c Luther is the first Apostle to us of the reformed Doctrine.

Conradus Schlusselburge says: fol. 12^. M. Jewel Apol. part 4. c. 4. diuis.

[It is impudency to say, that many learned men in Germany before Luther, did
hold the Doctrine of the Gospel.

Georgius Milius says: [if there had been right belieuers that went before
Luther in his office etc there had been no need of a Lutheran reformation:
therefore (says he) we say that Luther was tayled up by Gods special
appointment, and extraordinarily

Benedict. Margonstern says? tract de Ecclesia page 145 Luther in Epist. ad
Argentinenses An. 1525
[It is ridiculous to think that in the time before Luther, any man had the
purity of Doctrine, and that Luther should receive it from the^, and not they
from Luther. Considering (says he) it is manifest to the whole Christian
world, that before Luthers time, all churches were overwhelmed with more then
Chymerian darkness, and that Luther was divinely raised up to discover the same,
and to restore the light of true doctrine;] in so much that Luther says, we
dare boast that Christ was first published by us.

The examples of Elias makes wholly for us, and against our Adversaries, and is
therefore by them either ignorantly mistaken, 3. Kings c. 19.
or wilfully misapplyed, for it is evident that feering the face v. 2.3.
of Iezabell, wife to A-A^^ab, who sought his Life, he lay there upon, secret
in a cave upon mount i Horeb in the wilderness at the time of his forsaid
complaining that he was lest a lone, the which he then uttered, not generally,
but in regard only of that country (of Israel, which was the kingdom of
Achab, wherein he then astraunger, lay secret) as appears most plainly, in
that God himself accordingly answered his complaint with like respect to that
only country saying as is objected: I have left to me in Israel seven thousand
etc. 3. Kings 18.13.
(one hundredth whereof Elias himself had then before special notice given) as
also that in those very times the church did greatly flourish in the other next
adjoining Kingdom of Judah and was as then to him there both known and visible
under twoe good kings 3. Reg. 22.41.44.
Asa and Iosaphat, who reigned even in the time of Achab. At which time the
number of the faithful was there so exceeding great, that the 2. Chro^. 14
8.9. and 17.14. etc.
soldiers only were numbered to many hundredth thousands; [examine this well
and I doubt not but the objection is solued.]

Upon due consideration of the foresaid premises, how justly may we thence
take occasion to forewarne seven in the very words of that ancient and holy
father Vincentius Lyrinensis who lived in the year of our Lord 430) the
Catholics of our time, against the Syrene enchantments of all persuading
nouelists, notwithstanding their colorable reverence of Scripture so
frequently by them alleged in defense of their innouations to the contrary.

This ancient father then says of nouellistes* lib. aduer. haer. Paulo post
initium and after the edition thereof with Dionysius Areopagita his works
printed at Lyo^s 1572. page 660. 661. 662.
what do they promise, but a new and unknown doctrine, for thou may here
some say, come ye foolish and miserable who are commonly called Catholics,
and learn yet the true faith, which no man understands but we which has
lien hid this many ages, but now of late is revealed and made manifest etc. are
not these the words of that harlote.

And a little after he premonisheth to the contrary saying: keep the
depositum or pledge, what depositu^? that is, that which is committed unto
thee, not what is invented by thee, what thou have received, not what thou have
excogitated, a thing not of wit, but of learning: not of private usurpation,
but of public tradition. And again: o [this is as it were solemn, and
lawful withal heresies, always to rejoice at Profane novelties, and abhor
known antiquity but on the contrary this is almost proper to Catholics to
keep the sayings and writings of the holy fathers, to condemn profane
novelties etc] Also he says Ibidem.
[heere perchance some man will ask whether heretics, do use the divine

[vpon this, place S. Chrysostomo says thus: how does he regard the flock

he begins first the speak, and John every where holds his peace: But
Peter gives account for him also.

FATHERS.
The first therefore of the Greeks is Origin (for Dionysius, Clement,
Anacletus, and such like Bishops of Rome I omit, because our adversaries do
not admit them) who lived anno 230. and says. in cap. 6. ad Romans
Although the whole care of feeding the sheep was committed to Peter, and the
church was founded upon him as upon the ground, yet there was no confession of
any virtue exacted of him, save only of charity.

Eusebius anno 330. says: M. Chronico 44 year of the birth of our Savior.
The Apostle Peter borne in the country of Galile, And first high priest of
the Christians: [where we are to observe the difference which Eusebius puts
between Peter and the Bishops of other Cities, for of Peter he does not say,
the first Bishop of the Romans, as he says in the same place of James: The
first Bishop of Jerusalem ordained by the Apostles was James the brother of
our Lord. And of Euodius he says: Euodius was ordained first Bishope of
Antioch. He speaks not so of Peter, but calls him the first high priest of
the Christians. And again he calls Peter, lib. 2. hist. c. 14.
the most approved and greatest of all the Apostles, prince of the chief
Apostles, and captain and and Master of the army of God.

What other meaning can it bear to be captain of the army of God, then to be
head of the church militant?

S. Basil anno 380. speaking of Peter says: Sermon. de iudicio Del.
he is blessed what was placed in authority over the rest of the Disciples,
and to whom the keys of the kingdom of heaven were committed etc.

de moderatione in disputationibus seruanda.
S. Gregory Nazianzen showing that there must be an order in all things:
takes an argument from the Apostles; who although they were all great, yet
they had one chief over all: says he you see how amongst the disciples of
Christ, all of the^ indeed being great and of high degree, and worthy election,
this man was called the Rock, and had the foundations of the church committed
to his charge, and the rest of the disciples were content to be his inferiors.

S. Epiphamus Anno 390 says: he res 51.
He chose Peter to be the captain of his Disciples. And again: in Ancorato.
this is he to whom it was said, feed thou my lambs, to whom the sheepfold
was committed.

Cyrillus Hierosom. anno 350. Catech. 2.
calls Peter the most excellent Prince of the Apostles.

lib. 12 in Ioannem cap 64 in Thes^^ro (si D Thomae credimus ^^n opusculo
con^rra Graecos.
Cyrillus Alexand. anno 4^0. says: how the Prince and head of the rest, first
cries out; thou art Christ the son of the living God. And again: As
Christ, (says he) received the scepter of the Gentiles church from his father,
going forth leader of Israel, over all principallitie and power, over all
whatsoever it be, that a uery thing might be subject unto him so did he committ
fully and wholly unto Peter and his successors, and Christ gave that which was
his own, to no other but to Peter himself only.

S. Chrysostom says: hom. 11. in matthew.
he ordained Peter to be the Pastor of the church which was to be And a little
beneath: [God can only grant, that the Church which is to be (notwithstandnig
so many and so great waves rushing out with their force one auery side) do
remain immoueabl^, whose pastor and head (behold the name of head, unheard of
with Calvin) is a fisherma^, and of mean degree. And a little beneath: The
father did put Hieremie over one people, hom. vlt. in Ioa^nem
but Christ has placed this man over the whole world. And agane he does
often repeat that the care of the brethren, that is, the Apostles, and the
whole vvolrd is committed to Peter.

in cap. vlt Ioannis. 7
Euthymius Ano 1150. does twice mention, that Peter has received authority
over the Apostles And says? Of thou say (says he) how did James receive the
seat of Jerusalem. in cap. 22. Luc
I answer, this man (Peter) is ordained master of the whole world, where
he shovveth, that as James was bishop of Jerusalem so was Peter of the
whole world.

Theophylactus Ano. 480. upon that; confirm thy brethren: says: The manifest
understanding of this is, beause I esteem thee as prince or chief of my
Disciples, after that having dinied me thou have wept, and done penance,
confirm the rest, for this becomes thee, who after me art the rock and
foundation of the church. And a little beneath Thou, Peter, being converted,
shall be a good example of penance unto all, who notwithstanding thou have
been an Apostle and denied me, shall receive again the primacy of all, and
government of the whole world.

Oecumenus says: in cap. 11 Act.
Peter arises, not James, and is more fervent, and as it were he to whom the
superiotie of the Disciples was committed, anno 1070.

Hugo Etherianus sieve Heretrianus, anno 1540. in the time of Emanuel the
Emperor, writ certain books of the proceeding of the holy Ghost against his
Greeks, wherein the says: lib. 3. cap. 17.
It is manifest even by the thing it self that Christ did ordain Peter and his
successor, prince and head, not only of the latins and Greeks, the west, and
north part of the world; but also of the Armenians, Arabians, Jews, Medianites
and all the East, and middle climate for ever.

Of the Latin Fathers S. lib. de^nitate Ecclesiae. in epist ad Iubaianu^.
Cyprian, makes Peter the head, fountain, and root of the whole church: And
in another place he says of him; we hold him the head and root of the
church, anno 240.

Maximus says: in 3. ser. de Apostolis.
what great merit then had Peter with his Lord, that after the rule of one
little boat, the government of the whole church should be delivered unto him?
anno 420.

Optatus, anno 370. says? lib. 2. co^tra Parmenianu^
The chair is one and thou can not deny, but that thou know, the chair
was granted first unto Peter in the City of Rome, where he did sit head of
all the Apostles being from thence called Cephas, or rock, in whom only the
unity of the chair was maintained by all, neither did the rest of the
Apostles defend every one his own, so that now he should be a Schismaticke and
sinner that should place another a against this particular chair, therefore the
chair is one, which is the first of the dowries. Peter did sit the first in
it, Linus succeeded him, and Clemens, Linus etc. Here you may see the name of
head and chair of Peter and his successors to be named the only chair of the
whole church, which were altogether unheard of with Calvin.

S. Ambrose, anno 280. in ca. vlt. Lucae.
calls Peter the vicar of the Love of Christ to wards us, and says that he
is placed over all.

And again: in ca. 12. epist. 2 ad Corinth.
not Andrew (says he) but Peter received the Prama^y. Behold again a name
unheard of to Calvin.

And again he says. in cap 1. ad Vilat
the care of the churches was commanded to Peter by our Lord, Finally he
says: Sermon. 11.
our Lord did ascend this only ship of the church, in which Peter was
constituted master, our Lord saying; (upon this rock will I build my church)
which shipp does slote so in the depth of that age, that although the world
perish, yet it preserves all whom it has received, whose figure we have
seen already in the old testament, for even as Note Arcke, when the world
suffered ship wrack, preserved all in safty whom it received, so likewise the
church of Peter, when the world shall burn, shall present all, whom it
co^prehendeth, safe and without harm: and as then the deluge falling away, a
dove brought the sign of peace to the arcke of Noe, so also the last judgment
passing away, Christ will bring the joy of peace to the church of Peter.

S. Hierome says: lib 1. in Io^^^^na^ Anno 380.
Amongst twelve one is chosen, that a head being constituted, occasion of
Schism might be, taken away, but why was not John, a virgin chosen, it was
bestowed upon age, for Peter was elder to thend that a young man, and as yet
almost a boy might not be over men of riper years.

S. Augustine says lib. 2. c^. 1. de Baptismo Ano 400.
I think (says he) that Cyprian a Bishop, may be compared to Peter an Apostle,
without any dishonor, in as much as pertains to the glory of martyrdom,
but I thought rather to fear, least I be thought contumelius against Peter, for
who does not know, that the primary of his Apostleship is to be preferred
before any Bishopric? but although grace touching the chaires do differ, yet
the glory of martyrs is one

And again speaking of Peter's prymacy says: Sermon. 124. de temp.
he heals the disease of the whole body in the head of the church it self, he
works the health of all members in the very top etc.

The Author of the questions of the old and new testament says: in tom. 4
operum Augustini q 75.
as in our Savior there were all causes of master shipp, so after our Savior
all are contained in Peter, for he constituted him their head, that he might be
the Pastor of our Lords flock. And a little beneath: it is manifest (says
he) that all are contained in Peter; for asking for Peter he did vouchsafe, to
ask for all, for the people are always praised or corrected in him, that is
put over them.

S. Leo, says: Sermon. 3. de assumptione sua ad Pontificatum an. 450.
Peter is only chosen out of the whole world to be placed over the vocation of
all gentles, all Apostles, and all fathers of the church, that although therbe
many Priests, and many Pastors: yet Peter does properly govern all, whom
Christ also does principally rule. And again.

S Prosper says: l. de ingratis anno 450.
Rome the seat of Peter being made head of pastoral honor to the world,
whatsoever it does not possess by arms, it holds by religion etc.

Arator says of Peter: in capit. 1. Actor.
to whom the lamb delivered, whatsoever sheeppe he had saved by this pastor
through the whole world, by which office he is become the chiefest etc

S. Gregory says: lib 4. epist. ^2. ad Mauritiu^ anno 600.
it is plain to all that know the Gospel, that the care of the whole church
was committed to blessed S. Peter, prince of all the Apostles: And a little
beneath: Behold he has received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, power of
binding and losing is given to him, the care of the whole church and
principality is committed to him.

S. Bid says: homil. in vigilla S. Andre^, in illud intuitus eum etc Joan.
142.
He saw the simplicity of his heart, he saw the courage of his mind, by whose
merit he was to be placed over every church. And again: And homil in s^^^o
Petri and Pauli anno 720.
therefore (says he) S. Peter, who confessed Christ with true faith, affected
him with true love, and received especially the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, and principallitie of judicial power, that all belieuers in the world
may understand, that whosoever does separate himself after any manner from that
unity of faith and society of his; he can neither be absolved from the bonds
of his sins, nor enter the gate of the kingdom of heaven.

S. Bernard says epist. ^^7 ad Eugenium.
The place, wherein thou stand is holy ground, it is Peter's place, the place
of the prince of the Apostles, where his feet stood; it is his place whom our
Lord co^stituted master of his house and prince of all his possession. And
again: lib 2 de consideret speaking of Peter Ano. 1140.
going like our Lord upon the sea, he did manifest himself the only vicar of
Christ, who ought not to be over one people, but over all, eue^ as there are
many waters, many people.

These sower and twenty testimonies of the fathers, as the sower and twenty
voices of the elders in the Apocalypse, do evidently demonstrate the consent of
the primative Church, as well the Greek as the Latin, to which nothing
certainly can be answered other wise the^ Luther and Calvin say of Leo (Pope)
they suffered humane things and were deceived, werfore to make it (if
possible) yet more plain, se^ here the Aduersaire.

THE ADVERSARY.
Calvin alleged in M. vvhitgiftes defense says: page 173.
The twelve Apostles had one amongst them to govern the rest.

Musculus says. Ibid. 469.
Peter is said in many places to have been chief a monge the rest, which we
deny not.

M. whitgift says. Ibid page 375.
Among the Apostles them selves there was one chief etc. that had chief
authority over the rest etc. that schisms might be composed. page 595. page
62. 63. 65. 68. 70.
[And again, In so much as he doubts not to answer certain places of
scripture objected by our Adversaries against Peter's Primary.]

M. Fulke speaking of Leo and Gregory, Bishops of Rome, the first about anno.
450. the other about anno. 600. says: in his Retentiue against Bristowes
motives etc. page 248.
the mystery of iniquity having wrought in that seat (of Rome) near five or
six hundredth years before them (so long before them did the Roman Sea
begin to be Papal) and then greatly increased, they were so deceived with
long continuance of error, that they thought the dignity of Peter was much
moreover the rest of his fellow Apostles, then the holy scriptures of God do
allow.

The fathers for affirming the church to be built upon Peter, namely S.

the Centuristes.

Calvin says: Instit l. 4. cap. 6. sect.

many of the Fathers expound it, but the whole scripture is against it etc.

Cent. 6. col 58. a line. 2.
The fathers doubted not publicly to celebrate a yearly festival day in

error.

rest to suppress the seeds of dissension, says to the Puritanes. If this
were the principal means to prevent schi^mes and dissentions in the primitive
church, when the graces of God were far more abundant and eminent then they
now are: Nay if the twelve were not like to agree, except there had bine one
chiese among them for so says Hierome, [amo^ge the twelve one was therefore
chosen that a chief, or head being appointed, occasion of dissension might be
prevented etc] how can they think that equallity would keep all the pastors
in the world in peace and unity etc. for in all societies, authority (which
cannot be where all are equal) must procure unity and obedience: Also he
says: page 10. b.
that it was not to cease with the Apostles, these he.

Melanchthon, says from the opinion of him self and other his brethren. in the
book entitled. Centuria ep^ Theolog etc. epist. 74. que est Melancthonis. ^
As certain Bishops are president over many churches: so the Bishop of Rome is
president over all Bishops, and this canonical policy no wise man, as I
think, does or ought to disallow etc. for the monarchy of the Bishop of Rome
is, (in my opinion) profitable to this end, that consent of Doctrine may be
retained; wherefore an agreement may easily be established in his article of the
Popes Primacy, if other points could be agreed upon: These he.

Luther himself says: in loc. commun. class. 1. cap. 37.
for as much as God would have one true Catholic church through the whole
world, it was necessary there should be some one people, yea some one father
of that one people chosen, unto whom, and his posterity, the whole world
might have recourse and become one sheepfold; so that of all nations and of
infinite diverse manners, yet there might be made one church.

Page 470. 471.
For the confessed government of Bishops and Archbishops in all ages since the
Apostles times, see M. Whitgiftes defense.

M. Cartwryght says: in his 2. reply part. 1 p. 582.
if an Archbishop be necessary for the calling of a prounciall council, when
Bishops are divided, it is necessary there be also a Pope, which may call a
general council, when division is between Archbishops: for when the churches
of one province be divided from others, as you ask me, so I ask you, who
shall assemble them together? who shall admonish them of their duties when
they are assembled? if you can find away how this may be done without a Pope,
the way is also found whereby the church may be disburdenned of the Archbishop.

Likewise the council of Calcedon, whose authority is established by special
act of: anno 1. Elizabeth. C. 1. versus sinem.
Parliament, where the authority of the fowet first general councels, is
established. I say this council did offer the name of universal Bishop, to
the Bishope of Rome, which was no new donatio^, but only a declaration of what
he was in re before; and his refusal was not of the thing, but of the name,
which might be taken in an ill sense, as we see afterward in the Patriarch
of Constantinople.

Our Puritan adversaries do affirm and grant. In their ^ittle Treatise in
octauo entitled. English Puritanisme etc. printed anno 1605. page 26.
That the high Priest of the Jews was typically and in a figure the supreme
head of the whole Catholic church: which though (say they) it were visible
only in the province and nation of levvry, yet those of other nations and
countries (as appears by the history of the Ackes, eue^ though they were
Ethiopians) were under this high priest and acknowledged homage unto him. So
that he was not a provincial Metropolitan, but in very deed an Oecumenicall
or universal Bishop of the whole world etc. (In so much that it is there next
adjoined) And therefore the Pope of Rome who a lone makes claim unto, and is
in possession of the like universal Supremacy, has more vvarrant out of the
word of God for the same, then any Metropolitan, or Diocesan not dependent
upon him, has or can have: So that by the word of God, either there must be
no Metropolitanes or Diocesanes, or else there must be a Pope. These they.

M. Cartvvryght affirms: M. whitgiftes desc^te etc p. 428.
That the high priest was the head priest over all the whole church, which
was during his time, unto our Savior Christ: therefore if by this example we
will have an Archbishope, he must be such an one as may govern the whole
church.

M. D Raynoldes says. in his conference p. 251.
The law of Deutrenomy was made to establish a highest court of Judgment, in
which all harder causes Ecclesiastical and civil might be determined
without further appeal.

M. Whitaker says. de Sacra Scriptura p 466.
I answer, those words are to be understood etc. of the authority only
whereby to decyde difficulties and controversies, whether they be
ecclesiastical by the minister, or political and civil by the Magistrate,
that there might be alvvayes in both of them, some man, from whom it might
not be lavvfull to appeal. E^ Ibid. p 470.
For otherwise there would never be any end of contention. These he.

M. Bilson says, in his perpetual government of Christ's church page 20.
That the same did concern matters which were of greatest moment, both
civil and sacred, and their sentence by Gods law no man might refuse without
punishment of death. [See the like assertion in M. Hooker in his preface before
his books: page 26. 27. 28.
Ecclesiastical Policy.

M. Penry (a Puritan) [in his supplication to the high court of parliament
saith] how that form of gouerme^t which makes our Savior Christ inferior to
Moses, is an impious, ungodly, and unlawful government, contrary to the word
etc.

M. Whitaker says: Contra Campianum. rat. 6. page 97.
Gregory, the great although then Pope of the Roman Church, yet now he is with
us against you, for what? does it but little concern your Pope, when,
whosoever calls himself universal Bishop, him without further que^^ion he
terms the precursour or sorrunner of Antichrist etc John Bishop of
Constantinople did first challenge it to himself etc and a little after, this
title was taken from him and given to the Pope or Bishope of Rome.

But because the tittle or name of Universal Bishop lies open to a double
acception or understanding; let S. Gregory himself explicate in what sense he
took it to be the foreru^ner of Antichrist. lib. 4 ep. 36 ad Eugenium.
Wherefore he says: if one be called the universal Patriarch, the name of
Patriarch is (thereby) taken away from the rest. And again: l. 7. op. 69 ad
Eusebium.
if one be the universal Bishop it remains then that you be not Bishops. And
again.

l ^ ep 34 Ad Constant.
All others contemned, he endeavors to be called the only Bishop. In so much
as Pelagius, Gregory's, next prede^essour says.

in ^ pist. 1. Dilectis fratribus etc. Pelagius.
Let no Patriarch ever use this so Profane a name or term, because if one be
called universal Patriarch, the name of Patriarch is taken way from the rest
etc. yet does not Pelagius therefore reject the primary of the Roman Church,
for in the same epistle nere the end he says: It is related to the
Apostolical seat that John, Bishop of Constantinople does subscribe himself
universal Bishop, and that by this his prescription he does call us to a
general council, when as all authority of calling a Synods or council is
given to the Apostolical seat of S. Peter by special privilege etc. wherefore
whatsoever you have ordained in your foresaid conuenticle etc. I command by
the authority of S. Peter, Prince of the Apostles etc. ( which authority also
is derived to his successors) that all things which he there ordained, be
void and frustrate etc. let that conuenticle know, and John himself, that,
unless he do quickly correct his error, we will excommunicate them etc. be
earnest brethren that Ecclesiastical honor be not now diminished in our
days, or that the Roman s^at, by the institution of our Lord the head of all
churches, be at any time, bereaned or spoiled of her privileges any where.
Wherein Pelagius does so abundantly explain himself that Osiander confesses
and says in epito. etc. Cent. 6. page 243.
He is very carne^ against John of Constantinople, in that he does arrogate to
himself the title of universal Patriarch, and shows that by this Profane
title of (universal) he does take the name away from the other Patriarchs
etc. yet in the mean time he contendeth, that the Roman church is the head of
all other churches, and bableth much of the privileges granted by Christ to
Peter.

Concerning Gregory, that learned Caluinist. Andraus Fric^^ (whom martyr. Job
co^mpart 4. page 77.
Peter Martyr terms an excellent learned man) says. Friccius lib. 2, de
Ecclesia. c. 10. page 57.
Some there be etc that object the authority of Gregory, who says, that such a
title pertains to the precur^our of Antichrist, but the reason of Gregory is
to be known, as it may be gathered our of his words, which he repeateth in
many epistles, that the title of universal Bishop is contrary to and does
gain say the grace which is commonly powered upon all Bishops: he therefore
that shall call himself the only Bishop, takes the bishoplie power from the
rest: wherefore this title he would have to be rejected etc. but it is
nevertheless evident by other places, that Gregory thought that the charge and
principallitie of the whole church was committed to Peter etc. and yet Gregory
thought not that Peter was for this can so the forerunner of Antichrist. These
he; which is so plain that in place of much more that might be said, I think
this may suffice, especially when to this day the Pope does no less detest the
title of universal Bishop, whereby he should acknowledge no Bishop in Gods
church but himself, then Gregory or Pelagius did.

Pope Clement who lived in the Apostles time An. 80. lib. 3. recognit.
says: Y speak, how does God judge every man by his deeds according to truth,
if he have not in his power to do a thing if this be held, all things are
frustrate in vain shall the study be of following better things, also in
vain are Judges over laws, and punish them which do evil. for they had not
in their power to resist sin:

lib. de di^in. nomi. cap. 4. par. 4.
S. Dionisius Areopag. anno. 80. sai^k. z But some man may say, infirmity does
not deserve punishment, but pardon, if therefore he could not resist, perchance
it might righty be objected, but if there begiuen forces from the chiefest good
(God) who, as holy writings teach, does give simply sufficient to all, it is
not to be pardoned.

S. Ignatius Disciple to S. John Evangelist in epist. ad Magne. sianos.
says; for as much as our actions themselves have their rewards, and Life is
promised to obedience, but death to disobedience, and every one that has
chosen either this or that, does follow that which he has chose^, let us fly
death and choose Life. And a little beneath: if any man give himself to
piety, he is the man of God, if to wickedness, of the Devil, this is not done
by nature, but by the seedome of the mind.

S. Iustine Martyr anno 150. says: in Apolegia ad imperatorem Antoninum
unless mankind ca^ both fly foul and indecent things, and follow fair and
good things of his own freewill, it is without all cause and blame of
theires, howsoever things be done. But we teach that he can of his own free
will and accord both do well and ill; And in the same places nei-should he be
worthy of reward or praise if he did not choose a good thing of his own accord.

S. Iraenaus anno 160. says lib. 4 ca. 71.
where Christ says: [how often would I gather together thy sons and thou
would not.] does manifest the Law of freewil in man, because God made him
free from the beginning. And he Concludes: they which do good works shall
receive glory and honor, because they have done good when they might do
evil, but those which do not work this good, shall receive the just judgment
of God, because they have not done good when they might have done it. [Obserue
also here an excellent testimony of the merits of good and evil workes]

S. Cl^^^ Alexand. anno 190. says lib. 1. (...).
because free Chov and desire does first make sins, punishementes are
worthyly inflicted. Et infra: which things when they are so, both to be free
from ignorance, and from evil and delightful choice, and above althinges not
to assent unto those deceiptfull fantasies and sightes, is placed in our power.

S. Athanasius anno. 340. says. oratione contra idola circa principiu^.
The soul is free and at this own will, for as it can incline it self unto
good. Et infra: which when it does behold the free command and will of it
self, it does perceive it self to be able to use the members of the body unto
both parts, both unto those which are, and unto those which are not, but those
which are, I call good, those which are not, evil.

S. Basil anno 380 says: in explicat psalm. 61.
It will not be sufficient for thee to say in the day of judgment, I knew not
good, there will be brought forth to thee thy own balances, having sufficient
judgment both of evil and good. And again: in oratione de libero arbitrio.
that freewill which is in man does consist in choosing, and not choosing.

S. Gregory Nissene, anno 280. says. lib. 7. dephilos. cap. 1.
To have concupiscence and not to have it, to lie and not to lie, and
whatsoever such kind of things, wherein the works of virtue and vice do
consist, these are in our free will.

S. Gregory Nazianzen, anno 380. says. in carmin de Christo patiente
n Neither will God make it a necessity that thou be good, for that is placed
in thy choice and will.

S. Cyrill Hieros. anno 350. says. Catechesi 4. mystag.
Know that the soul is at her own disposing or free will, Et infra: the soul
has free will, and truly the devil can stir up a man, but he can by no
means force him against his will, he does motion the cogitatio^s of whoredom
unto thee, if thou will, thou do approve them, if thou will not, thou do
disallow them, for if thou should of necessity play the whore, for whose
sake should God prepare hell?

S. Cyprian, anno 240. says. lib. 1. epist. 3. ad Corn ^ ^i
Our Lord did not rebuke those which would depart, or sharply threaten the^,
but rather turned unto his Disciples and said and: what? will you go away?
observing the law, to wit, whereby man being lefto his own disposing? and
placed in his own freewill, does desire either death or salvation. And a game:
lib de vnitate Ecclesiae.
but God does permit and suffer these things to be done, the will of every
man's own liberty remaining free.

lib 3 diuinarum institut. cap. 24.
Lactantius Firmianus Anno 320. says: he which gives precepts, ought to cut
of the ways of all excuses whereby to impose upon men a necessity of doing,
not by any force, but for shame, and that notwithstanding he do leave free
liberty, that there may be a reward co^stituted for such as do obey, because
they might not have obeyed, if they would, and that there may be a punishment
for such as do not obey, because they might have obeyed, if they would.

In comment. Psalm^ 2.
S. Epiphanius Anno 390. says: Heresi 14 quae est Pharisaeorum.
Therefore it is manifest, evident, and without doubt, that freewill is granted
to every man by God, who said by him self; if you would, and if you would not,
that both to do well and evil might be in man's power.

Heresi 14 quae est Pharisaeorum.
S. Hilarie Anno 250. says, he permitted to every one of us liberty and sense
of life, not binding a necessity to any thing.

hom 22. in Genesin.
S. Chrysostom Anno 380. says: Is it not manifest that every one may at his
own freewill choose either vice or virtue? for unless this were so, but that
wickedness should be ingrafted in our nature, it were not necessary that either
these should be punnished, or they receive the rewards of there virtues but
because all is left in our will after the grace of God, therefore pu^nishmentes
are ordained for the wicked, and rewards for such as do well.

Homil. 11.
S. Macharius of Aegypte Anno 370. says: but that election and the liberty of
will may at once abide and remain, which God first gave unto man, therefore
althinges are governed by his own dispensation, and the condition of bodies is
such, that it is put in the will of man to turn unto either good or evil.

lib 2. in Ioannem cap. 54.
S. Cyrill Alexand^. Anno 430. says: He shows the free will of man in these
words, that according to the judgment of his own mind he may go unto either:
for so justly we find praise if we do well, and contrary, if we commit
evil.

lib 1. de Jacob. cap. 3.
S. Ambroso Anno 380. says: we ought not to ascribe offense to either of us,
but to our will. No man is bound to offend unless he incline of his own will.

S. Gaudentius. Anno 390. faith: tract. 3. sign. Exodus
Freewill once granted shall not be taken away, least he judge him who was not
free in his action.

S. Hierome, Anno 380. says: Epist. ad Damasum de filio Prodigo.
he gave to them free will, he gave them the liberty, of their own mind, that
every one might live, not according to the command of God, but according to
his own pleasure that is, not of necessity, but of his own will, that virtue
might have place, and that we might differ from other liueing creatures, for
as much as it is permitted us by the will of God to do what we will: where
upon judgment might be just upon sinners, and a just reward given to the holy,
and just. And a gain. In Dial. 3. contra Pelag.
this is it that I said to thee at the first. That it is in our power to sin,
or not to sin, that free will may be preserved.

S. Paulinus Anno 400. says: Epist. and ad Seuerum.
what grace have we, (if we be only faithful in an other man's thing)
unless we keep it of our selves, that is, out of the freedom of our will.
And a gain. Epist. and 8 ad eundem.
I have known good, and done evil, when I might as well have done good.

S. Innocent Pope. Anno 402. says: in rescripto ad Concilium Mileuitanum
We received freewill when we were borne.

S. Celestinus Pope Anno 423. says: Epist. ad Gallos cap. 13.
Free will is not taken away by the help and gift of God, but freed, that of
dark it does be come light, of wicked, good, of sick sound, and of unwise,
wise.

S. Prosper Anno 450. says: lib. 1. de vocatione Gent. c. 3.
Neither because he does it by the spirit of God, let him therefore think he
has not free will, which then he has not lost, when of his own accord he
has given him self to the Devil, by whom the judgment of his will is
depraved, not taken away.

S. Fulgentius Anno 480. says: lib. de Incar. ^ great. Christi 3.20.
man's free will is not taken away by the grace of God, but made whole or
sound.

S. Augustine, anno 400. says. lib. de quant. animaec; ^6.
Free Will is given to the soul, which whosoever does endeavor to obscure by
idle reasons, he is so blind, that indeed he does not understand how he
speaks those very same vame and sacrilegious things, out of his own will.
And again: lib. de gtar and sib. arbit.
there are (says he) some, who do so defend the grace of God, that they deny
the free will of man, or that when grace is defended, they may think free will
is denied. And again: lib 4. ad Iultanu 4 capite. and
I might much less say, that thou do lie, in saying that I said, free will
is denied if grace be commended, and grace is denied, if free will be
commended. And again. Epistola 47.
we have done as much as we could with those, both yours and our brethren,
that they should persevere in the sound Catholic faith, which does nether deny
free will whether unto an evil life or a good life, nor attributes so much
unto it, as that it can do any thing without grace. And again Epistola 89.

neither is free will therefore taken away, because it is helped, but it is
therefore helped, because it is not taken away. These S. Augustine.

it may not be denied, but that Irenaus, Clement, and others called

M. Whitaker says: I make small account of that place of Ecclesiasticus,
neither will I believe the freedom of man's will, although he should affirm it
an hundredth times, that before man, were life and death.

Also ancient Philo the fevv, who lived in Christ's times affirms: lib. quod

that man has freewill etc. to which purpose (says he) is extant that oracle
in Deutronomy. Deuteronomy. ca. 30. xo. is and 19.

M. Fulke says. in his defense of the English tra^slations etc. page 320.
The Jewish Rabbinos, Patrons of freewill do err etc.

Caluins and Luthers contrary doctrine as follows. Luthers Doctrine.
Luther, [doth so abhor this Doctrine of freewill, that he styles it with a
quite contrary title calling it, servile will, and says. in suorum
articulorum assertious art. 36.
In the other articles of the Papacy, of councels, of Indulgences, and other
necessary trifles, the leuitie and foolishnes of the Pope and his accomplices
is to be borne withal, but in this article of the servitude of the will, which
is the best of all, and sum of the whole business, we ought to mourn and
lament that those wretches are so mad. And in the same place. Free will (says
he) is a fained invention in things, and a title with out the thing, because
no man has in his power to think any good or evil, but all things come to
pass by an absolute necessity, which also the Poet understood, when he said:
All things stand upon a certain law. Et infra: there is no doubt but this
name of free will entered into the church. Satan being the master thereof.

Philip Melanchthon also says: In locis suis commun.
The voice of freewill is usurped and, altogether swaruing from holy scripture,
sense, and the judgment of the spirit. Also: for as much as all things that
are, do necessarily come to pass according to deuyne providence, there is no
liberty of the will. The scriptures do teach that all things do necessarily
happen etc.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: lib. 2. instit. cap 2.
that man is now spoiled of the liberty of freewill, and is sold to miserable
servitude. 4.
the Latins (says he) have always retained the name of freewill. The Greeks
are not ashamed to usurp a term much more arrogant, as if the power of man
were in himself.

Again.. ^.
I think it would be a great good unto the church if it were blotted out,
neither will I usurp it, and if others do ask my advise,. 5.
I will wish them to abstain from it. Again: moreover that I say the will is
deprived of its liberty, and drawn, and brought by necessity unto evil, it is
a marvel if this seem a harsh speech unto any man. Again;. 25.
neither has he any power to move himself unto good, more then there is an
affection in metals and stones, inclining to the perfection of their being.
Again. 29.
But if the whole man be subject to the command of sin, certainly it must
needs be that the will which is the chiefest seat, is constrained with most
straight bonds. Again, cap. 3.. 2.
in every in firm body their is remaining the force of life, but a soul
drowned into that deadly gulf is not only spotted with vice, but altogether
made void of any good. To conclude he says: lib 2. instit. c. c.. 8.
Although the Greeks above all others, and amongst them specially Chrysostom,
do exceed all measure in extolling the faculty of man's will; yet all ancient
writers, except Augustine [whome not withstanding a little after being
forgetful of, he does scurge as miserably as the rest] do either vary in
this matter, of stagger, or speak so doubtful, that a man cannot almost
collect any certayntie out of their writings. These Call. but how true he
speaks, I refer you to that which goes before.

FATHERS.
S. Irenaeus, anno 160 says. lib. 4. c. 73.
Our Lord has not only reserved to man the freewill of his power in works,
but also in faith, saying: According to thy faith be it to thee, showing forth
the proper faith of man, because he has his own sentence, and therefore he
that belieueth in him has life everlasting, and he which does not believe the
son, the wrath of God does remain over him.

S. Ambrose, anno 380. says. lib. 2. In Luc. c. 2.
Thou see that every where, the virtue of our Lord, does cooperate with man's
studies.

S. Chrysostom, an. 380 says. hom. 19 in Genesin de iustificatione dislerens
and
He does not impose a necessity, but fit remedies being applied, he does
permit all to ly in the sentence of the sick, And again: hom. 11. in Ioannem
anno 80.
the soul has power in it self to work it own good, neither does it obey God
in any thing unless it will

S Prosper, anno 450. says. lib 2. devocat gent. cap 12.
Therefore it is free to many who now use the judgment of reason, to depart,
that there may be a reward not to have departed, and that which cannot be done
without the spirit of God cooperating with it, it may be imputed to their
merits, by whose will it was done. Again. Ibid. c. 26.
Truly the grace of God does chiefly excel in all iustifications by
persuading with exhortations, by warning with examples, by terrifying with
dangers, by moving with miracles, by giving understanding, by inspiring
council and illuminating the heart it self and instructing by the affections
of faith. But also the will of man is joined with it, which is stirred up by
these foresaid helps to this, that it do cooperate with the deuyne work in it
self, and that it do begine to exercise to merit, what by deuyne seed it had
conceived to desire, having of it own mutabilitie if it fail, of the help of
grace, if it profit, which help is given to men by innumerable ways whether
they be secret or manifest: that it is of many refused, it is their wickedness,
but that it is of many received, it is both of deuyne grace and man's will.

Austine, anno 400. says: lib. 2 Contduas epist. pelagianor. cap. 1.
man does prepare the heart, not vvithstanding, not without the help of God,
who does touch the heart: Et infra, although, unless he help, without whom
we can do nothing, we cannot open our mouth, yet we do open it by his
help and our work; for what is it to prepare the heart, and open the mouth,
but to prepare the will?

Again: tractatu 72 in Joan.
To the belieuer in him that does justify the wicked, his faith is reputed to
him unto justice; in this work we do the works of Christ, this he does
work in us, yet not without us. Et infra: man does cooperate his eternal
salvation and justification with Christ working in him. Again: Sermon. 15 do
verbis Apostoli circamed.
you see that conversion it self is not without the help of God: Et infra: All
from God, yet not as if we did sleep, not as if we do not endeavor, not
as if we will not, without thy will the justice of God shall not be in
thee, he that made thee without thee, does not justify thee without thee.
Again. lib. despirit^ and ^littera ad Marce^^num cap 34.
To consent to vocation, or not to consent is of man's own free will Again
lib de praedest Sanctor. cap ^
Both is ours, to will, sci; to believe, and to love for free will, and both
are given by the spirit of faith and charity.

Again. Ibid. ca. 5.
Not because to believe or not to believe is not in the will of man, but the
will in the elect is prepared by our Lord.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says. lib qui scribitur operationes in psalmos
It is an error to say and hold that free will has some captivity in a good
vvork^ when we speak of the internal work. For to will as we have
said, is to believe, to hope and love motion, plucking, and leading of the
word of God, is a cer^en continual purgation and renouatio^ of the mind, and
understanding from day to day in the knowledge of God, although it be not
alvvayes of like feruencie, yet that passion is alvvayes a passion, behold even
as clay in the hand of the potter, so is the house of Israel in my hand, what
authority I pray you, has the clay when the Potter gives a form unto it, is
there not there a mere passion

Here we may se that Luther will have the heart of man, when it is
converted, to be no other wise, then as clay, when a pot is made of it, or
wood vvherof Mercuties statue is made.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says. lib. 2. Instit. c. 5.. 7.
But therbesome who will grant, that the will being contrary to its own
understanding is converted only by the virtue of God, but yet so as being
prepared, it has afterward his own power in vvorking. And he sub^oyneth:
but this is wickedly attributed to man, that he should with his will as a
hand mind wait upon grace going before, therefore it is not well said of
Chrysostom,. 10.
[neither can grace without the will, not the will without grace work any
thinge] but it moves the will, not as it is delivered and believed many ages
since, that it should be after ward in our choice, either to obey or resist the
motion, therefore we must needs reject that so often repeated by Chrysostom,
Whom he draws, he draws him (the Party drawn) vvilling it. Again:
Ibid. c. 2.. 4.
Chrysostom (says he) has it written some where, because God has put both
good and evil in our power, he has given us free will of election, and does
not retain us against our wills, but imbraceth us being vvilling. Also often
times that which is evil if he will, is changed into good, and a good man,
that does fall through sloth, does become evil, because God has made our
nature to be of a free will, neither does he impose a necessity, but
necessary remedies being prepared, does suffer al to rest in the sickmans
condition. Also that unless we be helped we ca^ never do any thing as we
ought or well; so unless we on our part endeavor what we can, we shall
never obtain the favor of God. But he said first that all is not from divine
help, but that we ought also to do some thing, so that this word is very
familiare with him: Let us do what we can, and God will supply the rest.
to which also that is agreeable which Hierome says: it is our part to begin
but God will perfect it: it is our part to do what we can, his, to full
fill what we cannot. you see here certainly (says Calvin) in these
sentences that they give more unto man in the study of virtue, then is fit
(wherefore he concludes) they speak therefore (says he) to Philosophically of
this mutter, who boast that they are Christ's Disciples.

THE 18. ARTICLE. Faith alone does not justify.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
The true Catholic faith, where by a man is justified, is not only distincke
from Charity, and other good works, but does often times exist a part, neither
is any man justified (that is to say) pronounced, or accounted just by God for
any imputative, extrinsicall, or alien justice, to wit, of Christ, if he
remain still truly and really unjust, and defiled with mortal sins inherent
in him; But a-man is justified, that is, of impious, or at least not just, he
is made pious and just, of not holy, he is both called and truly made holy by
his own intrinsicall and inherent justice and sanctity, which justice or
sanctity consists in the habit or root of faith, hope, and charity,
planted in the heart of man, for all though the merit of Christ only. According
to which divine habit of justice infused into us, it free do a man yet
afterward he does become more just by good works (that is to say) of just
and holy, he does become more just and holy by his own good works and
merits, dignified by gods holy grace which does accompany and follow the same.

appeared in us, because God has sent his only begotten son unto the world that
we may live by him.

Again: lib. 15 de Trinit. cap. 18.
He does not make faith it self profitable but by Charity; for it is true,
faith may be with out Charity, but not profit. And: q with out love, faith
profits othing. Again. Tract. 10. in Joan.
now some man does believe in Christ, but he hates Christ, he makes his
confession of faith for the fear of punishment, not for the love of a reward,
add to this faith, love, that there may be such a faith whereof the Apostle
speaks.

ad Gal. cap. 5. v. 6.
Faith, which works by charity. Again: Sermon. 16. de verbis Apostoli.
Man begins at faith, but because the Devils also believe, it is necessary
to add hope and Charity. Again. Sermon 22. lib de Praedest. Sanctorum c. 7.
The house of God is founded in believing, erected by hoping, and perfected by
loving. Again: Enchirid. cap. 8.
therefore the Apostle says, a man is justified by faith and not by works,
because faith is first given, whereby all other things are obtained, which
properly are called works, wherein a man does live justly. Again. lib. de
great. and lib. arbitr.
Men, not withstanding what the Apostle says: do think a man to be justified
by faith without the works of the law: they thought he had said, faith was
sufficient for a man, although he live wickedly and have no good works, which
God forbid, that the vessel of election should think so. Again: Praefat. in
Psalm. ^1.
How therefore is a man justified by faith with out works? The Apostle himself
does answer: Therefore I said this to thee o man, lest thou should as it
were presume of thy works, and through the merit of thy works, think thou
have receive the grace of faith. Do not therefore presume of thy works, before
faith, know that faith found thee a sinner.

Again Sermon. 16. de verbis Apostoli.
We are justified, but that justice when we do well, does increase.

S. Prosper anno 250. says lib. 1. de vita contemplat. cap. 19.
neither works with out faith, nor faith with out works, does justify.
Again. and in respons. ad cap. 6. ad Callor.
A man being justified, that is, of a wicked become pious, with out any good
merit going before, he does receive a gift, by which means he does obtain
merit, that which was begun in him by the grace of Christ, is increased by
the industry of free will, the help of God being alvvayes present.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says: in comm. in cap. 15. Genesin.
I know these virtues are excellent gifts of God, I know that faith with out
these gifts cannot stand. Et infra: we know that faith is not alone but does
bring with it charity and many gifts. Et ibid. here I speak plainly what
faith alone does, not as it is joined with other virtues. Faith only does
obtain remission of sins. Hence also is it that he says. in cap. 2. ad
Gallat.
Faith with out and before Charity does justify. And. Faith is the formale
justice for which man is justified, not for Charity. And. only faith is
necessary to make us just, all other things are free, neither commanded nor
prohibited more or less. Again: in argum. eiusdem epist.
the greatest or chiefest art and Christian wisdom is, not to know the law, to
be ignorant of good works, and all active justice. Again: lib. de libert.
Christiana.
a Christian man has no need of any work or law being free from all law by
faith. Again: Sermon. de nouo Test. sieve de missa.
Let us take heed of sins but much more of laws and good works, only let us
attend unto the promise of God, and faith.

Also the Lutherans of Saxony affirm as much saying: in Colloquio
Altembeigensi.
amongst us there is no doubt but the holy scripture does call that justice of
Christ, by which we are justified before God, and by which we are just, the
passion and obedience of Christ. Et ibid. the obedience, and the merit of
Christ is the thing it self which is imputed unto us, yea the very justice
which is given and bestowed upon us. I wherefore they conclude: saying: good
works and new obedience perteyne not unto the kingdom of Christ, but to the
world, so that good works are so fare from being necessary, as that they are
also pernicious and unprofitable to salvation. Finally we ought to pray, that
we may persevere unto the end in faith, with out all good works. These they.

Luther yet says: lib. de captiuit. Babylon cap. de Euch.
a man can talk or deall with God no other way then by faith he cares not for
works: Again: a Christian is so rich that he cannot perish although he would,
how wickdly soever he live, unless he will not believe. Again, in exposit.
Epist in die Dominico a natali Christ proximo, ex cap. 3. Gal.
Moreover (says he) there is no other thing required unto salvation but to
hear, and believe our lord Jesus Christ Again. loc. comm. etc class ^. c. 68.
page 68.
as nothing justifies but faith, so nothing sins but unbelief. Again: in
2 Part. Postillae. ger. pr. Argente ra^^ 1537. fall. 140.
No sin (says he) is so great as to condemn a man, for only infidelity
condemns all men, that are condemned: and on the contrary, only faith makes
all me^ blessed.

The same affirms his Scholar Tindall saying: in Fox. Act mon. page 1 37.
That Christ ordained, there should be no sin, but infidelity, no justice, but
faith.

M. Whitaker says: de Ecclesia contra Bellarm. controu. 29.5. page ^01.
we say that if a man have the act of says sin does not hurt him, which
also Luther affirms, and all we maintain. These M. Whitaker.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: in Antidoto Concili^ Trid. ad can. 11. Sess. 6. lib. 3. instit.
cap. 11.. 23.. and cap. 16.. 1.
it is faith only that justifies, yet faith that justifies is not alone: as
the heat of the sun is not alone, which warmeth the earth. Again: thou see
that our justice is not in us, but in Christ, wherefore then are we justified by
faith, because we apprehend the justice of Christ by faith by which only we
are reconciled unto God.

Again: cap. 11.. 19.
we say a man is justified by faith only.

Again:. 2.
he shall be justified by faith, who having excluded the justice of works, does
apprehend the justice of Christ by faith, where with being vested, he hoth
appear in the sight of God, not as asinner but as just.. 2
And therefore when God does justify us by the intercession of Christ, he does
not absolve, or forgive us, according to the approbation of our own
innocence, but according to the imputation of Justice, so that we may be
deemed just in Christ who are not Just in our selves

Now if you will know whether Calvin consent with the ancient fathers
hear him self saying: Ibid. 1^.
they babble that the ceremonial works of the law are excluded but not the
Morale

Finally it is so hard amatter for aiust man, or a man of a holy life, by
doing well to become more just with Calvin, that by how many the more good
works he does, so many the more sins does he heap up, and decerueth so many
the more stripes, for he says: lib. 3. cap. 14. 9.
There is not one work of the Saints which if it be considered in it self,
but it does deserve a just reward of reproach,. 11.
yea it is damnable: Let us take heed therefore, of good works. Again he
says: cap. 11.13.2. 15.
Let their dream therefore be of force, who feign justice to proceed from
faith and works. z And certainly in these things, no not Augustines sentence
or (at least) manner of speaking it altogether to be admitted. For although he
do marue lonsly spoil, a man of all praise of justice and do attribute al to
the grace of God, yet he refers grace unto sanctification, whereby we are
borne again unto newnes of life by the spirit. Again: Epitom. colloquij Mont.
13. belyer. page 44.48.
He that does once truly believe (says he) cannot after wards fall from the
grace of god, or loose his faith, by his adultery or other like sins.

Beza says. In resp. ad act. colleg. montisbelg. part. altera page 73.
That David by his adultery and murder, did not loose the holy ghost, and fall
from his faith.

An heresy condemned by the Primitive church.
The Lunomians did teach that, S. August. lib. de her. cap. 54.
no sins could hurt a man, if so be he had but only faith: the like was the
error and heresy of the Bogards who taught that; just men were not bound to
the observation of the commandments of God, but only to faith, whom the
council of vienn a condemned.

FATHERS.
S. Iustine, anno 150. says: in Apolog. 2. ant^ medium
men who by their works have showed themselves worthy the will and council
of God, we account them to live with him by their merits, and so to reign,
that they shall be free from all death and trouble.

S. Irenaeus, anno 160. says: Aduersus haereses cap. 72.
let us not account that crown precious, or of worth which easily and of it
own accord plats it self upon our heads, but that which we attain by pain;
and again; and by how much the more paynfull it comes unto us, so much the
more enriched and estimable it is.

S Basil, anno 380. says: lib. de S. Spiritu
man is saved by the works of justice. Again: S. ca. 24. orat. ^^ple princip.
all we that walk an Evangelical life, are Merchants, seeking for the
possession of heaven by the works of the commandments. Again: Proverb orat
ad Diui^es
show thy works and crave thy reward.

S. Cyprian, anno 240 says l b. de simply Pra^ator vel de vnitate Ecclesiae.
Man has need of justice whereby to merit God, we must obey his precepts and
admonitions that our merits may receive their reward. Again: Sermon* de
Elecmos. extremo.
if the day of natural rendering our soul, or unnatural, by persecution, find
us prompt, ready, and running this painful path of good works, our Lord will
never be wanting to reward our merits for, upon the works which obtain it in
peace, he bestows apure crown of whitnes, but for martyrdom in persecution,
he doubles, a purple crown.

S Chrysostom, anno 380 says: hom. 4. de Lazaro. Circanied.
If God be just, and will restore to these, and to those according to their
merits, and that here, neither of them does receive, either he the punishment
of his wickedness, or this reward of his virtue, it is manifest there does
remain another place, where they shall receive their reward.

S. Gregory Nazianz. anno 380. says: Orat. in S. Baptism^ extrema
Believe the resurrection, the judgment, and a reward to be received at the
just balance of God.

S. Gregory Nyss. anno 380. says: orat 1. do de amandis Pauperibus
Finally I see every man rewarded according to his merits: to those which have
bine good and courteous, perpetual rest is given in the kingdom of heaven;
but to inhumane, and wicked men, a punishment of fire and that forever.

S. Hylary, anno 350. says: Can. 5. in mattaum
Let us seek the kingdom of God, for the wages of our life, and this is the
reward of such as live well and religiously, that out of this matter of a
corruptible body, they are transferred into a new and heavenly substance, and
that this earthly corruption is changed for a heavenly incorruption, Connon
(...)
which happy eternity is to be performed.

S. Ambrose, anno 380 says. lib. 1. de officus c. 15.
It is not evident that either the reward of our merits, or punishments,

S. Hierome, anno 380. says. lib. 2 adulouinlanum prope finem
Denarius does free all out of prison by baptism as it were by the pardon of a
true Prince: Now it must be our labor to provide us diverse rewards,
according to the diversity of virtues.

S. Calestinus Pope, anno 4^3. says: in epistola ad Gallo^.
so great is the goodness of God toward all men that he will have those
things to be our merits which are his gifts, and for these which he does
give us, he will give eternal rewards.

S. Paulinus, anno 400. says. in Epistola ad vitricium
The just judge will acknowledge to thee the rewards of thy virtues.

S Prosper, anno 450. says: In respon ad cap. 6. Gallorum
man being justified, that is, of an impious made pious, without any former or
precedent good merit, does receive a gift, by which means he does get his
merit.

S Augustine, anno 400. says: epist. 105. (...) Sixtu(...)
are there no merits of the just there are certeynly, because there are just,
but that there might be just there were noc merits. Et infra: as for the
merit of sin, death is proposed as the stipend, so, for the merit of
justice, life everlasting is for a stipend. Again: lib. de motibus cap. 25.
life everlasting is a full reward, at the promise whereof we rejoice; neither
can the reward go before merits, or be first given to a man before that he be
worthy. For what is more unjust then this, and more just then God? we ought
not therefore to crave a reward before that we be worthy or decerue to be
received. Again: psalm. 73.
God himself has made himself our debtor, not by receiving, but by promising.
It is not said unto him, [^^^ore what thou have received, but what thou have
promised.]

And Sermon. 16. de ^^bis Apostoli.
God is become a debtor unto us, not by receiving any thing but, which pleased
him, by prom sing Et infra: therefore after that manner we may crave of our
Lord. [restore what thou have promised, because we have done what thou
commaunden,] and thou have done this, who have helped us lab u^ing.

M ^ulgentius, anno 480 says. in Prologo Libro^^^d monimum.
For he through his own goodness did vouchsaue to make himself our debtor.

THE ADVERSARY.
[For the confessed Doctrine of this opinion in Clemens Alexandrinus,

M. Whitaker says: that not only Cyprian, but almost all the most holy fathers
of that time, were in that error, as thinking so to pay the pain due to
sin, and to satisfy Gods justice. [In so much as in Gallat. cap. 4.
Luther, does therefore call Hierome, Ambrose, Augustine, and others]
Iustice-workers of the old Papacy.

Bullinger says. in Gallat. cap. 4.
That the Doctrine of merits, satisfaction, and justification of works did
incontinently after the Apostles time lay their first foundations.

in Apocalips 87. fol. 270.
M. Wotton [for bears not to tax for this very point of (merit) the
undoubted and confessed writings of Ignatius, Disciple to S. John the
Evangelist, answearing to his objected testimonie] in his defense of M. Park^ns

I say plainly this man's testimony is worth nothing, because he was of little
judgment in deuinitie.

in his defense etc. pa. 408.
[M. Whitgist acknowledges and urges these wrytinges or Epistles of Ignatius,
alleging in proof of them S. Hierome and Eusebius, And M. Cartvvryght, in his
answer thereto does not so much as deny the said epistles page 347.
M. Whitgist in the place aforesaid says,] Ignatius was S. John's Scholar, and
lived in Christ's time.

Now whereas M. Wotton in the place a foresaid to prove these epistles
counterfaire alleges this saying of Ignatius: whosoever does not fast every
Lords day or Sabbath except Easter day only, M. whitgist. in his defense page
102 in Hooke^ l 5. sect 73. page 209.
is a murderer of Christ: [which says M Wotton is absurd. To for bear M.
Wottons misalledging of Ignatius his words, which are indeed directly to the
contrary. In so much as M. Whitgist and M. Hooker do both of them, specially
mention, and answer this very objection urged by M. Wotton

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says: in exposit. Euang. Luc. 16. Domini cap. 9. a festo S. Trin. con.
1.
I will not give, no not apenny for Peter's merits, for how should they help
me, when they could not help himself; for what soever he has, is bestowed upon
him by faith in? Christ. Now if he cannot help himself, how shall he do any
thing for me? [He obiecteth to himself] do thou say that good works are not
to be done for respect unto eternal life; behold here it is otherwise
written, what then shall we do? (he answers) there be many sentences in
scripture every where, which sound of our merits that we should satisfy the
justice of God by good works, Conc. 3
but there take heed of that leven. Again: provide your selves treasures in
heaven: This we will say that they who know not faith, do speak and think
as well of reward and works For they think them after a humane manner that
they should buy heaven by their works, which are dreams and vain
cogitations, these Luther.

Again he says: in exposit Euang. in die Phil. and Iac. Apostoloru^.
here we ought to learn that we are not saved by our merits, but by the
spirit of Christ [as if Christ were not the author of merits and good works
in his faithful, and he who does give force unto them.

Philippe Melanchthon says: in confess. Aug. and eius Apolog. art. 2^ and in
loc. comm tit. de bonis operi^^us.
Although good works do not decerue remission of sins, and the inhereta^ce of
life everlasting, yet they merit other corporal rewards, and spiritual in
this life, and the life to come: [vvhich notvvithstanding he does not explicat,
I think he knovves not what he says.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: lib. 1. instit. c. 15. ^. 3.
first I must meeds speak of the name of merit: whosoever therefore did first
give that title to humane works, compared to the judgment of God, did very
ill, or little respect the sincerity of faith. For to what end, I pray you,
is that name of (merit) brought in; but it is manifest, with great damage to
the whole world, what great offense it does contain, but omitting the name,
let us take a view of the thing it self rather, he says:. 3.
what our works do merit, the scriptures teach, when it says they cannot
endure, or abide the sight of God, because they are full of uncleanness,. 4.
moreover the Doctrine of the scripture, is, that all our good works are
continually sprinkled with much uncleanness, whereby God is justly offended and
angry with us, so far are they from reconciling us unto him, or bringing us
any benefit, Ibid. c. 12. 4.
the cause (says) he is, because all the works of men are nothing but
uncleanness and filth and that which is vulgarly esteemed justice, is mere
iniquity with God: Again: c 14. 9^
we have not one work proceeding from the Saints, which if it be
considered in it self, does not merit a just reward of reproach. Finally,. 11.
there has bine no work at any time, of any godly man, which if it be
examined by the severe judgment of God, is not damnable.

M Foxsaith: Act mon. page ^^ 8,
when we sin, we diminish not the glory of God, all the danger of our
living being the evil example to our neighbor.

M. Wotton says, in his answer to the late popish. art. p. 92, and 41.
sin is pardoned as soon as committed (the faithful person at once) having
for giuenes of all sins past and to come. [So daungerously, do they seem to
draw near unto libertinisme, and bewray themselves to be those of whom S.
Jude forewarneth, calling them, ungodly men, transferring the grace of God into
wantonness.

The extenuating of good works was so grateful to some Calumistes, that their
blessed man of God and constant martyr of Jesus Christ (for so he is termed
by page 46.
Bi^kley in his Apology for religion etc.) M. Tindall was careful to prevent
all merit of good works, that in his book mutuled the wicked Mammon, he
doubts not to affirm Act mon. page 4^^.
that Christ with all his works did not deserve heaven. page 57^, and 4^6,
That M. Tindall was the author of this book, see also Fox, Ibid 486, and 4^^,
which sentence their other martyr ohn Teuxbury defends for plain enough and
true as it lies.

Also M. Tindall says: Ibid. 1^^6.
there is no work better then other, as touching to please God, to make water,
to wash dishes, to be asewter, or an Apostle, all is one to please God.

To conclude; Calum says, l. 2. Instit. cap. 17. s. 6.
To ask whether Christ did merit, is no less a foolish curiosity then a
rash definition. Et infra: for by what merits could man obtain to be judge of
the world, head of Angels etc. Again he says against Christ, mereting for us.
lib 2. cap 17. Acct. 1.
I confess indeed, if any man will oppose Christ simply by himself to the
judgment of God, that there is no place for merit, because there is no
dignity in man, which can merit or deserve God.

[Finally that you may know this doctrine not to have bine received or known
in the primitive church he says. lib 3. cap. ^. 5.
[These things in former ages were not handled nor treated of, as they ought
to have bine, otherwise there would never have risen such troubles and
dissentions.

An old heresy condemned by the primitive Church.
[This heresy was condemned in Iouinian, as witnesses. lib. contra

good works were not meritorious.

a fast of forty days being declared, our lord Jesus Christ did so enter the
sight against the Devil, giving us all example that by it we should be armed.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says: Sermon. ^4.
Our lord has made holy the lent unto us by fasting: Ibid. what Christian
s^eller does not fulfill the lent by fasting shall be holden guilty of
preuarication and contempt. Again: Sermon. 37.
This he did for our saluations sake, that he might not only teach a profitable
thing by word, but also might instruct by examples, that by the same stepps
which we run unto faith, we should go unto abstinence.

S. Hierome anno 380 says: in cap. 58. Esaie.
Our lord Fasted forty days in the wilderness, that he might leave us solemn
days of fastinges.

Again: Ad Morellani aduer. errores. Montani.
we in a time sitinge for us do fast one lent, according to the tradition of
the Apostles.

S. Epiphanius anno 390. says against Aerius, who contemned commanded
fastes, lib. de her. here is. 75.
that fastes were commanded by the Church and accustomed to be Celebrated, and
also ordained by the Apostles.

S. Leo Pope anno 440 says. Sermo 6. de quadrag.
That therefore my beloved, which is fit for every Christian to do, that is now
more carefully and devoutly to be performed, that the Apostolical institution
of forty days be accomplished by fasting. Again: Sermon. g. de quadrag.
the greater fastes are instituted by the Apostles according to the doctrine of
the holy ghost, that by the common fellowshipe of the Cross of Christ, we
also might do some thing in that, which he has done for us. Again: Sermon. 11.
de quadrab.
The chiefest and most holy fast is at hand, which does crave to be observed of
all the faithful without exception.

S. Theophilus Alexaadr. anno 390. says. lib. 3. Pasthali.
That the law of abstinence from flesh in the lent has always bine in the
Church, and that those which did eat flesh were held guilty of a great crime.

S. Augustine anno 400. says. Sermon. 62. de tempore in epistola 219. c. 15.
To fast on other days, there is a remedy or a reward, but not to fast in the
lent, is a sin. Againes: The forty days of fast have authority both in the
old testament, or books out of the fast of Moses and Elias, and out of the
gospel, because our lord fasted so many days.

Concerning the special forbearante, or restraint to fast upon Sunday.
It is confessed that the contrary under taken liberty of fasting upon the
Sunday (now renewed by the Puritans) was reproved by Pope Clement the first
anno 80. saying he that fasteth upon the Sunday or lords day is guilty of
sin. in epist. ad Philippens. page 99.
The like is affirmed by Ignatius, witness for them both M. Cart-wright in M.
whitgithes defense etc.

Tertullian. anno 200. says. de corona militis c. 3.
We account it a heinous offense to fast on the Sunday.

vbi supra.
See this also confessed by M. Cartvvrigth.

S. Augustine anno 400. says: epist. 85. ad Casulanum.
Who is it, that shall not offend God, if he will unto the Scandal of the
whole Church, spread every where, fast one our lords day?

Also the fourth Council of Carthage says: Canon. 64. anno 413.
He that does willingly and of purpose fast on the Sunday, is not taken for a
Catholic.

S. Epiphanius anno 390. condemns the Arrians saying: haeresi 75.
They desire rather to fast on the sunday, and eat upon wednesday and Friday.
In his defense page 102.
It was also the condemned heresy of the Manichees. See M. whitgift.

THE ADVERSARY.
As Concerning the appointed fast of lent. in M witgistes defense etc. page 100.
M. Cartwright reproves S. Ambrose for saying. It is sin not to fast in
lent.

in examen Council. Trid. part. 1. page 89.
Chemnitius Confesses that Ambrose, Maximus, Taumensis, Theophilus, Hierome,
and others do affirm the fast of lent to be an Apostolical tradition.

See Schul. tetus in medull. Theolo. Patrum. p. 440. and in whitgift in his
def. page 102. and M. Cartwr, Ibid. 99.
In more undoubted proof whereof other Protestant writers do not only affirm
the superstition of lent and fasting to have bine allowed and commended by S.
Ignatius a fore said, Scholar to S John. But also defend that that very
epistle of Ignatius ad Philippenses in which this doctrine is extant, is his
true epistle and not counterfayte. Which may answer our Adversaries usual
objection against it.

Epiphanius reporting the errors of Aerius affirms that he said: Haeresi. 75.
Neither shall fasting be appointed: for these things be Judicial and under
the law of Bondage, if at all I will fast, I will choose any day of my self,
and I will fast for liberty. See the like in Haeresi 54
S. Austine, and confessed by M. page 44 45.
Fulke in his answer to a counterfayt Catholic.

M Field says of Acrius, de Eccll l. 3. cap. 29. pa. 158.
he disliked set fastes etc. and was justly condemned etc.

This opinion of Aerius though thus condemned was yet so agreeable, and the very
same with the now professed Doctrine of the Protesta^tes, that M. Whitaker
says: contra Duraeum l 9. pa. 130.
Concerning fasting Aerius has taught nothing contrary to the Catholic faith.

See also this condemned opinion of Aerius yet further defended by M. Fulke vbi
supra and by de haeres c. 5 fol 175.
Danaeus, as in the Margent. Though yet others, who dislike our adversaries
over plain Nouelisme herein, do specially condemn Aerius and his foresaid
doctrine thus defended, as namely M Hocket in his Eccl. policy, l. 5 f. 72. p.
210.

Whereas M. Fulke, Aretius, and many others do commonly object that Montanus
the Heretic was the first that appointed laws of lasting, M. Hooker
answeareth with us, that the Montanistes, were reprehended only, for that they
brought in sundry unaccustomed days of fasting, continewed their fastes a
great deal longer and made them more rigorous etc. Where upon Tertullian,
maintaingning Montanisme wrote a book in defense of their fast etc. The same
affirms the foresaid Protestant Author page 110. M Fulk against the Rhemist
test in 1. Tim. 4^.
of Quermonia Ecclea,

Whereas M. Fulke, and Commonly all Protestants do object that sayng of S.
Paul. 1. Tim. 4.^.
Forbiding to Marry, to abstain from meat etc. A against our Catholic
Doctrine of fasting from certain meats M. Hooker says with us: M. Hooks his
Eccles. Polici l. 5. sect. 72. page 209.
Against those heretics (says he) which have urged perpetual abstinence from
certain meats, as being in their very nature unclean, the Church has still
bent her self as an enieniny. S. Paul giving charge to take heed of them etc.

Church and ministry of Eng^and page 59.
Author of Querimonia Ecclesiae gives the same answer to the said saying of
S. Paul; as likewise S Austine against Faustus a Manichie etc An answer so
euidenthy true, that M. Jacob the Puritan, acknowledges that place of S. Paul
to be understood of Marcion and Latianus, who did absolutely condemn Mariadge
and certain meats; and so (says he) are in no comparison with the Papists,
if they erred in nothing else.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
in resp. ad Ambros. Catharinum.
To day (says he) they do so fast, not that the flesh may be mortifyed, but
because it may be a good work, to fast this day or abstain from that kind of
meat to merit heaven. But what is this, other the^ the impious face of
Antichrist? And again: lib. de Doctritus hominum v^tandis.
It is (says he) erroneous, and full of lies that they do impose, as it were
by the decree and command of the Church, at certain times of the year a
necessity to fast the vigiles of the Apostles, and other Saints under pain
of a great sin. For fastinges concerning days and meats, ought always to
be free and indifferent. Again, in exposit. epist quae legitur deminica 1. i^
Ni^^li ad Gal. G^l. ^.
fasting is not a true chasticeing of the body, but a thing rashly taken in
place of a good work. Finally, that worshipp of thine, and study of religion
is no other thing, then was the religion of Molech and Baal in times past with
the Jews.

Philipp Melanchthon says: in loc. com. en. de caeremonij^ Ecclesiae.
it is a pernicious error to think that fastinges and such like are the
works and worship of God.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
lib 4. instit. cap. 12.. 19.
An other evil (says he) like unto this we must specially take heed of (to
wit) that fasting be not taken for a meritorious work, or any kind of divine
worshipp. The third error is not so bad, yet dangerous, as it were more
strick and exactly to crave one of the chiefest offices, and so to extollit
with immodest praise, as that men when they have fasted, should think they had
done some excellent thing. Wherein I dare, in part but not altogether excuse
the ancient fathers, but that they have laid certain foundations of
superstition, and have given occasion of tyranny which afterward did arise..
10.
And then the superstitious observation of lent began every where to increase,
because both the common people were persuaded that they did God some special
service thereby, and the pastors did commend it for a holy imitation of Christ
etc.

An old condemned heresy by the primitive Church.
S. Epiphanius ligres. 75. and S. August. lib. de haeres. cap. 33.
This heresy was the Arians, who thought that we ought not to fast as it is a
precept and rule of the Church, but every man as he would, least we should
seem to be under the law. Moreover Epiphanius adds, that clean contrary to
Catholics, they were accustomed to eat flesh, on fridayes, in the lent, and
chiefly in the holy week.

THE 19. ARTICLE. The laws and Precepts of Christ are not impossible.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
The law of God, and commandments of Christ, are not only not impossible to
be fullfild, but so possible unto the willing, and such as love God, as they
are sweet unto them, and easy, light, not heavy.

SCRIPTVRE.
Deuteronomy. 30.11.14.
THis commandment that I command the this day, is not above thee etc. But
the word is very near thee in thy mouth, and in thy heart to do it.

Leuit. 18.6.
Keep my laws and commandments, which a man doing shall live in them.

3. kings 2.3.
And observe the watches of our lord thy God, that thou walk in his ways, and
keep his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies as it is
wirten in the law of Moses.

Iosue 22.5.
That thou keep attentively, and in work, fulfill the commandment, and the
law etc.

^. kings 14 8.
Thou wast not as my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me
in all his heart.

Job 23 11.
My foot has followed his stepp, I have kept his way, and have not declyned out
of it.

Psalm. 118.32. and Psalm. 17 25.
I ran the ways of thy commandments. Read the whole Psalm. and Psalm. 16.3.

Ezechiel 18.19.
And you say, why shall not the son carire the iniquity of the Father, to
wit, because he has wrought judgment and justice, has kept all my precepts
and done them, he shall live?

Matt. 7.24.
Every one therefore that hears these my words and does them etc. And: cap.
11.^0.
My yoke is sweet, and burden is light. And: cap. 19.17.
if thou will enter into life, keep the commandments. Luc. 1.6.
They were both just before God, walking in all the commandments of our lord
with out blame.

Iomes 1.22
But be d^e^s of the word and not hearers only, deceauing your selves.

1. John 2.^. an^
In this we know that we have known hime if we observe his commandments.
And: cap. 5.3.
his commandments are not heavy.

FATHERS.
S. Basil anno 380. says: orat in illud: attend tibi.
It is a wiched thing to say the precepts of the spirit are impossible.

S Cyrill says, lib. 3. contra Iu^anum.
how that very precept (thou shall not covet) which is the most hardest of all,
may be fullfulled by grace.

S. Chrysostom. And 380. says: Homil 8 de poenitentia.
thou may not accuse our lord, he does not command impossible things, many
also do over came his commandments.

Again: Homil 19. in Mat^ltru^ ad iinem.
Therefore let us not fear the burden, neither do thou sly that yoke, whereby
Christ has freed thee from all these, but under take this yoke with all
alacrity of mind, and then thou shall easily know how sweet it is. Neither
dath it tear thy neck, but is imposed for an orname^t, and that thou may
learn to go forward in order to the kings way, and to avoid all head long
dangers on both sides, and walk joyful easily through a straight way.

Again. homil. 19. in epist. ad Hebraeos.
And thou say, how is this possible to love his neighbor as himself if
others have not done it thou may well think it impossible, but if they have
done it, it is manifest we do it not through negligence, also Christ does not
command any impossible thing in so much that many have (exceeded) his precepts.

S. Hilary anno 350. handling that. Thy commandment is to great. Psalm 2^ 118.
The commandment (says he) of God is great, and extended unto all the kinds
of our faith, so that it is not hard, if therbe a will to obey the precept of
our lord.

S. Hierome anno 380. says. lib 3. adu. Pelag.
God has commanded possible things, there is no man doubts of this.

Again. in comment. ad cap 5 prope sinem.
Many (says he) measuring the precepts of God by their own imbecillitie and
weakness, do think them impossible, which are not commanded, therefore we
must needs understand, that Christ did not command impossible things, but
things perfect and which David performed.

S. Augustine. anno 400 says: lib. de not. and great. cap. 43.
Therefore God does not command impossible things, but commanding he does
admonish, both to do what thou can, and to ask for what thou can not.

Again, cap. 16.
It is certain we may keep the commandments if we will, but because the
will is prepared by god we must ask of him that we may have a will unto so
much as does suffice, that by willing we may do it.

Again: cap. 69.
Therefore we do firmly believe our just and good God not to be able to
command impossible things, hence we are admonished, both what to do in
easy things, and what to ask in hard thinks; for all things are become
easy to Charity, to whom only, the burden of Christ is light.

Again: lib de pecca^or. meritis and remissi^ cap. 3.
God would not command any thing that shoud be impossible unto man's will.

Again: I cannot doubt or think that God has commanded man any impossible
thing, or that any thing is impossible to God to help or assist, whereby that
may be done which he has commanded.

Again: lib. de great. and lib. arbit. cap. 16.
The Pelagians thought that they knew a great mistere, when they said, God
would not command what he knew impossible for man to do, who knows not
this? And again: in Psalm. 56.
God would not command that we should do this, if he did judge it
impossible.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says: lib. de liberate Christiana.
all the commandments are as impossible unto us, as that one is. Thou shall
not covet, or or desire.

Again: in confutatione rationis Latomi.
There be so many testimonies of scripture which do prove the commandment of
God to be impossible unto us, as there is nothing more manifest.

Again: In responsione ad dialog. Syluestri Prieratis.
Thou do most wickedly, in that thou say our Savior has not commanded
impossible things, yea thou do more then wickedly, in that thou dare call
this falsehood, we cannot fulfill the commandments of God in this life.

Philipp Melancthon says. in commun suis ad cap 4 epist. ad Romanos
When the law commands us to love God, it imposes as impossible things, as
if it did command us to fly over the hill Caucasus.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: lib 2 instit. cap. 7. 5.
But because we have said that the observation, or keeping of the law is
impossible, we will in few words both explicate and confirm it, for it
seems to be an opinion commonly taken for most absurd, in so much as Hierome
doubts not, to curse it with excommunication. But what seems good unto
Hierome, I little respect. ibid.
I call that impossible which yet has never bine, and that hereafter it may
not be, is hindered by the ordination and decree of God. If we speak of these
latter times, I say there has bine never a Saint, who being at the point of
death, has attained unto that measure of love, as to love God with all his
heart, with all his mind with all his soul and with all his power.

Now here it is manifest, that he makes God himself the impediment why we
do not fulfill and keep that law, which he commands us.

An old condemned Heresy.
This heresy was held by certain men, Council. 11. conon. vlt. anno 440.
against whom the council of Arausicanum did define; where thus we read:
Here also we believe according to the Catholic faith, that by grace received
in Baptism, all that are baptized (Christ helpping, and Cooperating with them,
and if they will truly and faith full endeavor) may fulfill all things
necessary unto salvation.

THE 22. ARTICLE. To beseech the prayers of the righteous here on earth is no
derogation to our Savior.
SCRIPTVRES ONLY.

you there shall be joy before the Angels of God etc.

1. Peter. 1.15
And I will do my diligence to have you often after my decease also, that you
may keep a memory of althinges.

Ap^c 4.
And the smoke of the incenses of the prayers of the Saints ascended from the
hand of Angel before God.

THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
The Angels and Saints, of God are not hindered by te^porall death, and
leaving their mortal bodies, so that they can no more pray for us, neither do
they cast away all care, and love of Charity to wards us, that they will no
more help us: but they are most willing, and ready to pray for us, so that
they do help us, laboring and warring here on earth, by their holy prayers,
and we ought often to inuocat, and beseech their intercession for us unto God.

FATHERS.
S. Dionysius anno 80. says. cap. eccles. Hierarch.
Certainly it is all one; as if a man when the sun shines, should pluck out
his eyes, and yet not withstanding desire to be partakers of the light of the
sun, so he is held in suspense with a superstuous hope of impossible things,
who does crave the prayers of the Saints, and yet reject holy prayers, and
operations agreeable to their natures.

S. Irenaeus anno 160. says: lib. 5 contra h^^reses.
And as she (Eua) was seduced and did fly God, so this (Mary) was persuaded to
obey God, that the virgin Mary became the advocate of the virgin Eua.

S. Athanasius anno 340. says: Sermon in Euangel. de Sanctissima De^pata, sieve
de annontiatione Marix.
Incline thine care o Mary, unto our prayers, and do not forget thy people. Et
infra, unto thee we cry most holy vrign remember us. Et infra. Mistress, Lady,
Queen, and mother of God make intercession for us.

Eusebius anno 330. says: lib. 1^. praeparationis Euangelicae Cap. 7.
these things we do daily, who honoring the soldiers of true piety as
the frindes of God, do approach unto their monumentes, and make our vows and
prayers unto them as unto holy men, by whose intercession unto God, we do
confess our selves not to be a little helped.

S. Basil, anno 380. says: orat. in 40. man yres.
O vnconpereable soldiers, and common protectours and defenders of mankind,
and best companions of cares. He which is oppressed with any misery, let him
fly unto these, and he which does rejoice, let him beseech these, he, to the
end he may be freed from his evil, this man, that he may continue in joy, and
prosperity.

S. Gregory Nazianz, orat in Cyprianum.
anno 380. says in thend of that oration inuocating S. Cyprian. But thou
mercifully, behold us from above, and direct, and receive this thy holy people,
and nourish, and feed us together in peace: insighting, and strife, direct and
receive us, and determine with thy self, that such also as thy self do make
earnest request for us.

Again. orat. 15 de obitu Gregorij parentis sui.
Now he does more profit us by his prayers, then he did before by his Doctrine,
yea by h^w much the nearer he is unto God, for as much as he has put of his
corporal bonds.

S. Chrysostom, anno 380. says. Sermon. de Inuentio and Maximo. tom 3.
As soldiers, showing their wounds received in war, unto the king do speak
bouldly and with good confidence, so they carrying their heads cut of, and
bringing them forth in presence, may obtain of the king of heaven whatsoever
they will.

Again he says: homil. 66: an ^. p^lum prop. sin.
for also he which is adorned with purple, does approach to embrace these
Sepulchers, and all pride set aside, stands making supplication to the
Saints, that they would make intercession for him unto God, also he that does
walk adorned with his diadem, does beseech the carpenter, and the fisher man,
as his protectours.

S Gregory Niss. anno, 380. says inuocating S Theodor. orat. in Theodor. circa
linem.
Make intercession and beseech our common king and Lord for thy country we
fear afflictions, we expect perils, the wicked Scythians are not sure of
preparing war against us; use thy liberty of speech as a soldier fighting
for us, as, a martyr for his fellow servants infra. But if there shall be need
of more earnest prayer and aduocation, gather together the company of thy
Brother martyrs, and together with them pray for us, admonish Peter, stire up
Paul, and John also the Deuyne and beloved Disciple of Jesus.

S. Ephrem, anno 380. says: Sermon. de Laudibus S. Martyrum
we beseech ye most blessed martyrs, who freely and willingly have suffered
torments for our Lord and Savior, and for his love; also you are so much the
more familiarlie joined unto God, that you may vouchsafe to make intercession
unto our Lord for us wretches and sinners, and all filth through negligence,
that the grace of Christ may descend upon us.

S. Cyrill, anno 350. says: Catechesi S. ^mislag.
when we offerre this sacrifice, we make mention of them which have deceassed
before us first of the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs, that God
by their prayers may receive our prayers.

S. Theodoret, anno 440 says: lib. 8. ad Graecos.
such as travel with difficulty, do beseech the Martyrs for their
companions in the way, or rather captayns or guides in the journey.

[Againe he does in this manner conclude every man's life.] in historia S. S.
Patrum.
But now in a king an end of this my narration, I implore and beseech them,
that by their prayers I may obtain divine help

S Cornelius Pope, anno 251. says: in Epist. 1.
beseeching God and our Lord Jesus Christ, that his holy Apostles making
intercession for you, he would purge you from your sins.

S. Hilary, anno 350. says. in psalm. 124
Neither is there wanting to those that will, the protection of Saints, and
sauegarde of Angels. 1. tem. 129.
The nature of God does not want the intercession of Angels, but our
infirmity, for they are sent from those that shall inherit salvation, God
being ignorant of none of all this which we do, but our infirmity to ask
and merit does need the help of spiritual intercession.

S. Ambrose, anno 380. says. lib 8. in lu. in fine. lib 10. in Luc. 21.
As Angels are in authority, so also are those which have deserved the life of
Angels. And: kings being dead, martyrs shall succeed them in an everlasting
kingdom in the honor of heavenly grace, and they shall be suppliants, these
Patrones.

Again: lib. de vi^uis
we ought to beseech Angels who are given us for a sauegarde, also martyrs
whose Patronage we seem to challence for a defense of our body, they can ask
for our sins who have washed there own, if they had any with their own
blood, these arre the martyrs of God our prelates and beholders of our life
and actions, let us not be ashamed to take them for the intercessours of our
infirmity, for they have also known the infirmity of our body, when they
did once live.

S. Maximus, anno 420. says. Sermon. de Nartyribus Tauricis.
There is familiarity between these and us for they are always with us, they
always abide with us, that is, they both keep us living in our body and
receive us going out of our body.

Again praying to S. Agnes he says: Sermon. de S. Agnese.
O glorisious to Christ, fair to the son of God and grateful to all Angels,
and Archangels, we do beseech thee, by what prayers we can possible, that
thou vouchsaue to remember us.

S. Hierome, anno 380. says. in Epitapho Paulae circa ^inem
Farewell o Paula, help by thy prayers the last old age of thy worshipper, let
thy faith and good works join thee to Christ, that being present thou may
more easily obtain what thou shall request. Again. in epist. ad Paulum de
obitu Blesillae
she does beseech our Lord for thee, and obteineth pardon of my sins for me.

Ruffinus, anno 400 says lib. 2. hist. cap. 33.
He went about (to wit, the Emp. Theodosius) all the places of prayer with the
priests and people, and did lie prostrate in hearcloth before the shrines of
the martyrs and Apostles, and did crave undoubted help by the intercession, of
the Saints.

S. Augustine, anno 400. says: lib. 7. de Baptismo Cont. Donatistas. cap. 1.
let Cyprian, help us by his prayers, laboring in the mortality of this flesh
as it were in a thick cloud, that God assisting us we may imitate his good
works, as far as we shall be able.

Again. tractatu 84. in Joan
Therefore we do not so remember them (martyrs) at the very table, as those
which rest in peace, that we should also pray for them, but rather that they
(martyrs) should pray for us.

Again: Sanctis Petro and Paulo
n a multitude of people do worship, the most blessed fisher man Peter, with
their bowed knees. Heathens obiecting that Christians did worship the Angels:
he answers. in psalm. 96
I would to God, says he, that you would worship them, for then you should
soon learn of them, that they do not worship them as Gods but as Saints.

Again: Sermon. 17. de verbis apostoli
ecclesiastical discipline has, and teaches that the faithful know, when
they recyte martyrs in that place at the Altar of God, that they do not pray
for them, but for other the dead. For it is injury to pray for a martyr, to
whose prayers we ought rather to commend our selves: Sermon. 18. de sanctis
He has also there an excellent and a long prayer to the blessed virgin Mary.

S. Victor Vticensis, anno 486 says. lib. 3. de perseq. wandal.
O you Angels of God be you present, pray for us you holy Patriarchs and
Prophets, you Apostles, be you our intercessours, chiefly you blessed Peter,
wherefore art thou silent for thy sheep, and lambs commended to thee by our
common Lord with great care and earnestnes? you S. Paul, master of the
gentiles, know what the Arians do to wandalia, and thy sons being captives do
sigh mourning, and all ye Apostles sigh together for us.

S Fulgentius, anno 480 says. Sermon. de Laudibus B. Mariae.
Therefore the virgin Mary, received all the courses of nature in our Lord
Jesus Christ, that she might help all women slying unto her.

S. Leo Pope, anno 440 says: Sermon. 1, de Petro and Paulo
As we have tried and our elders have proved, we do believe and trust, that
amongst all the labors of this life to obtain the mercy of God we shall
always be helped by the prayers of special patrones.

Again. Sermon. 2. de anniuersario suae assumptionis
Peter does now more fully, and powrefully perform those things which are
committed to him, and does execute all parts of his offices and cares in him
by whom he is glorified. Again. Sermon. 3. de anniuersario
Now the pious pastor (Peter) does execute the commandments of his Lord,
strengthening us by his exhortations, and not ceasing to pray for us, that we
be not overcome by any te^tation. Again. Sermon. 5. Epiph.
Confirm frindships with the Angels, Patriarckes, Prophets, Apostles, and
join your selves to the martyrs, covet their riches, and by good contention
and emulation contend, and strive for their favors.

S. Iustine Martyr, anno 150. says. in 2 apolog 2. speaking in the name of all
Christians explicating the faith of the whole Churh.
We worship and adore him (God the father) and his son, who came, and taught
us these things, and we worship in word and deed the whole troop of others
that follow, and such like good Angels, earnestly teaching it to all that
desire to known, how we are taught and instructed.

S. Epiphanius, anno 309. [refelliing their error who offered sacrifice to the
B. virgin Mary as unto a Gods, fearing lest by this occasion their should be
no honor given unto her, as the heretics of our time now put in practice, he
repeateth very often these words, let Mary be had in honor, God adored.

S. Chrysostom, anno 380. says: homil. de Sanctis Inuentio and Maximo
you do not worship the Saints of ancient time, and these later after a
diverse manner, but all with the same alacrity of mind, infra. And the martyrs
that we worship this day were present; infra. And therefore let us often visit

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
de adoratione Sacramenti ad waldenses.
I cannot (says he) account you for heretics as our Sophister, do, because
you neither inuocat the mother of God, nor any other Saint, but rest in Christ
the only and alone Mediator: although one may make intercession for another
here in this life, yet for the intercession and invocation of Saints departed
the Scriptures speak nothing.

Again: Invocation of Saints (says he) is also one of the number of the
Antichristian abuses, in attieulis ad Council. Mantuanum missis.
whereby he resists the chiefest articles, blotteth out the knowledge of
Christ.

Philipp Melanchthon says: in antithest verae Doctrinae, and Pontificiae
all invocation of the dead is manifest Idolatry, such as is in the worship of
Saints.

Nicolaus Hemnimgius says: in explicat Euang. de Festo Annunc Mariae
invocation of Saints is a Diueli^h worship, brought into the Church by the
Devil.

Johan. Brentius says: in Apolog. Confessions wittemberg.
we grant that the Saints in heaven do pray for the liueing on earth: does it
therefore follow, they are to be inuocated? no such matter, etc. who commanded
you to invoke the Saints as the frindes of God? for this very worship of
inuocating Saints is idololatricall because God only is to be inuocated.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
lib 1. instit. cap. 13.. 12.
Let that Platonicall Philosophy, says he of seeking recourse unto God by
Angels be of force, and of worshipping them for this end whereby they may make
more propitious and easy unto us: which superstitious and curious men have
endeavored from the beginning to bring unto our religion, and do so persevere
unto this day.

Again, moreover (says he) it is a mere toy, that Sophisters babble, Christ
is a mediator of redemption, but the faithful, of intercession. Again: 21,
for as much as pertains to Saints, who are dead in flesh, but live in
Christ, if we attribute any prayer unto the^ (vvherby they may pray for us in
heaven,) let us not dream of any other way to beseech God by them, then
Christ, who is the only way, or that their prayers are accepted by God, in any
other name, therefore for as much as the Scripture does call us from all unto
Christ only, and our reauenly Father will have us to seek all things in him,
it were to much blockishnes, nay I say, madness for us to seek access by them,
and be led from him, without whom they themselves have no admittance. But who
dare deny, but this has bine practysed many ages, and to this day is in use
whersoeuer the Papacy ra^gneth? Finally in all their litanies, In fine Ibid.
hymns, and prose where there is any honor given to dead Saints, there is no
mention of Christ.

Ibid. 24.
But (says he) if any man excuse it, and say, it cannot be, but that they have
the same charity to wards us, which they had, when they were joined
together with us in faith, who notvvithstanding has revealed, that they have
ears so long as to reach unto our voices? and eyes so sharp, as to behold our
necessities? they idlelie imagine indeed in their shadovvees, I know not
what, of the splendour of the divine countenance illuminating, vvherby they
behold from above as in a looking gloss the affairs of me^. 27,
But this latter argument is easily confuted by their own impudency, in
that they contend by no stronger an argument, then as to say, we have need of
the Patronage of Saints, because we are not worthy so familiar access unto
God etc. But hence we collect that they leave nothing to Christ, who esteem
his intercession for nothing, unless George, Hippolitus, and such like Hagges,
or Hobgoblins be present.

An old condemned Heresy.
This heresy was proper to Vigilantius who said, Witness S. Hier. lib.
contra vigilantium.
that the prayers of the dead (for so he called them which live gloriously
with Christ) ought not to be spoken of or heard to be profitable for others;
from whence does follow, that it is in vain to invoke the Saints.

mentioned in Toby: neither do we acknowledge those seven Angels whereof he

against whatsoever may be said.

THE 14. ARTICLE. Of Saints Relics.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
We ought to have in price and honor the Bodies and relics of Saints, and
to use them reverently and holily with all pious devotion.

SCRIPTVRE. The Angels Protect Saints Bodies.
Inde. v. 9.
MIchael the Archangel disputing with the Devil, made altercation for the body
of Moses.

Unreasonable creatures spare the bodies of Saints both Dead and liueing.

S. Peter's shadow healed the sick:

Act. 19.11.12.
And God wrought by the hand of Paul miracles not common: so that there were
also brought from his body napkins or handkerchefs upon the sick, and the
diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out.

FATHERS.
Eusebius anno 330. speaking of the wooden seat of S. James says: lib. 7. in
hist. cap. 15.
It is kept with great care, as delivered from our elders in memory of his
sanctity, and is had in great veneration and worship.

S. Athanasius anno 340. writes in the life of S. Antonie that he left an old
cloak, and also adds: the receauer of blessed Antonies legacy, who has
deserved to receive by his command an old cloak (with an other garment made of
a goats skine hanging down from the neck) does embrace Antonie in the gifts
of Antonie, and as it were enriched with a great inheritans, does joyfully
remember the Image of Sanctity by a vestment.

S. Basil an. 380. says: in psalm. 115. in illud. Praetiosae ^n conspectu
domini more Sanctorum
when any man dies like a Jew, the things left behind him are abominable;
when death happe^neth for Christ, the relics of his Saints are precious, in
times past it was said to the priests and men dedicated to God; he shall not
be defiled by any dead, but now he that touches the bones of a martyr, does
receive a certain society of holiness, by the grace remaining in the body.

Again speaking of the relics of martyrs he says: orat. in 40. Martyrs.
these are they who govern our country and cleaving together as it were
certain towers do promise security from the incursions of our enemies, not
shutting themselves up in one place, but are become hosts in many places, and
pray for many cou^treyes.

S. Gregory Nyss anno 380. says. in The odorum Martyrem.
The soul after it has ascended on high, does rest in it place, and being
freed from the body, does live together with like unto it self, but her
venerable body, and immaculate instruments, composed and adorned withal
honor and worship is placed in a fair and holy place. And if any man entering
the temple of martyrs has delighted his eyes with beholding, and do afterward
desire to approach the sepulcher it self, believing the Sanctity and
benediction by often touching of it, but especially if he be permitted to take
of the dust where the body of the martyr does ly or rest, that dust is taken
for a great favor or gift and is gathered as a-thing of great price to be
hidden in the earth, for how much it is to be desired and wished for to touch
the relics themselves, if at any time so good fortune happen, that a man may
do it, as the gift of all prayers, they do know that have tried it, and are
made pertakers of that desiere.

S. Eusebius Emissenus, anno 520. says: homil de S. Blandina.
where are they, that say there is no veneration or worship to be given to the
holy bodies of martyrs?

S. Cyrill of Hierus. anno 350. says: Catech. 18.
But that not only the soul of the Saints might be honored, and that it might
be believed that there is power and virtue in the bodies, of the Dead; The Dead
man lying in the sepulcher of Eliseus, is raised to life by touching the dead
body of the Prophet.

S. Chrysostom, anno 380 says of S. Inuentius and Maximus: Sermon. de SS.
Inuentio (...)
Therefore let us often visit them, let us adore there sepulchers, and whith
great faith touch their relics, that thereby we may get some blessing or
benediction.

S. Ambrose, anno 380. says: Sermon. 93. de. SS. Nazario and celso. in fine.
what do thou say to me, what do thou honor, now resolved and consumed in
the flesh? I honor the wounds in the flesh of a martyr, received for Christ's
name, I honor the memory of the liueing by perpetual virtue, I honor
hallowed ashes for the confession of our Lord, I honor the seed of eternity
in the ashes, I honor the body which has taught me to love our Lord, and not
to fear death for his sake. Why do not the faithful honor that body, which
the devils do reverence? which also they have afflicted in punishment, but
honor in the sepulcher? therefore I honor the body, which has honored Christ
in the sword, and shall reign with Christ in heaven.

S Hierome, anno 380. says: lib. Adu. vigilantium
It grieves him that the relics of martyrs should be covered with a
pretiouse covering, and not rather bound up in a clout or hearcl^th, and cast
unto the dunghill that only drunken and drowsy vigilantius may be adored.

S. Augustine, anno 400. says. epist. 203. ad Qui^tianum
Truly they carry the relics of the most blessed and gloriouse martyr
Stephan which your holiness is not, ignorant of, and as we did, which also you
ought reuere^tly to worship.

in Sermon. quem de cruce edidit in festo ex altationis crucis.
There is (says he) such great abundance in the world of little pieces of the
cross, that if they were gathered to gether, a house might be made of them. Et
infra: I would (says he) there were none of the crown of thorns exstant, and
that there had never comforth any of the holy cross etc. wherefore if any man
should give me such afragment for agift, yea if I had that cross in my hand,
and knew it to be so, I would presently so lay it up, as it should never see
sun more etc. But the same that I said of the holy cross, do I also say of
Saints relics as they term them, for these relics are no other thing
then the seducing of the faithful, wherefore it were much better that they were
buried under the earth: vigilantius writ upon this same, against whom Hierome
opposed himself with all his force, in so much that certainly I would he had
temperated himself a little better in this matter, but if I would give credit
to the works of vigilantius, as they are exstant, according to Hierome, I
should rather believe that he had written much more Christian like, then
Hierome himself, upon this matter.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
in libello ^uo, quem v^^cat admon^tionem de perqu^tendis (...)
Therefore (says he) to speak in few words, the desire of relics does never
want superstition, yea which is worse, it is the mother of Idolatry, it was
the office of Cristians to leave the bodies of Saints in their sepulchers, and
not to erect them up with a sumptuous and costly work, whereby to make an
vntymly resurrection of their bodies, this certainly was never understood, but
on the contrary against the decree of God, the bodies of the faithful are
diged up, that they might be richly extolled and praised, when as they ought to
rest in their sepulchers, as in beds until the last day.

This preaching of Caluins was so frutfull in France, Laut. Surius in comm. ad
annum. 1561.

Lyone and Turon burned the bodies of S. Ireneus and S. Martyne.

that the relics of Saints ought not to be reverenced.

THE 25. ARTICLE. Of the Holy Cross and Images.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
The sign of the cross and use of Images of other Saints, do no way repugne
deuyne worship or the word of God, but do specially a gree with them both
therefore they are piously and religiously to be observed, both for the honor
and reverence of the first institutours, and also for the mysteries and hydden

answearing the gentiles asking why the Christians did pray with their face to

Tertullian. anno 200. says: lib. de corona militis.
At every motion and going for ward, at every passage and end, at our

S. Cyprian anno 240. says: Let the fore head be fe^ced that the sign of God

cannot carry the crown of the Devil it has kept it self for the crown of

But as a crown so with a joyful mind let us carry about the cross of
Christ, for all things that make unto our salvation, let them end by it for
when we are newborn again, the cross of Christ is present, when we are
nourrished with that heavenly meat, and when we are ready to consecrate, every
where and at all times that ensign of victory does assist us. Wherefore with
earnest desire, both in our chambers, in our houses in our windows, and also
in our forehead and mind let us always impresse the cross, for that is the
sign of our salvation the sign of common liberty, the sign of meeknes, and
the humility of our lord.

S. Ephrem anno 380, says: lib de poeuit cap. ^.

Again: Sermon. de inuentione Crucis.
it is a mere deceate and Idolatry to deall with these counterfeit Images, to

examples of most filthy luxury, and obscurity? so that if any man would
fashion himself to these, he were worthy of a bastinado, yea stews afford
whores more shamfast, and modest, then temples or churches do those which they
call the Images of virgins, they feign also a habit to martyrs no less
indecent, let them frame therefore there idols (at least) with a little shame
that they may ly with a little more modesty, then to say that they are books
of some sanctity but we will also answer, this is not the way to teach the
faithful people in holy writ. And a little beneath: to what end therefore were
there so many wooden, stone, silver, and gold crosses erected in churches
every where? Ibid. 9.
let them look hither therefore, who seek miserable pretenses to defend this
execrable Idolatry, wherewith true religion has bine drowned and overwhelmed
this many ages. Images, say they, are not taken for Gods, 13.
but this being omitted let us consider here by the way, whether any Images at
all be necessary in Christinian churches, first therefore if the authority of
the primitive Church move us, let us remember for the first 500. years wherein
religion and more sincere doctrine did as yet flourish and spread it self, that
Christian Churches commonly were free from images. But how impudent a lie this
is, may appear by that which has bine said, before.

An old condemned Heresy.
Nic. ephesians. lib, 16. ca. 27.
The Second Counsel of Nice anno 789. pronounced against Image breakers and
spoylers of monasteries. But Xenaius a Persian first of all taught that the
images of Christ and his Apostles and Saints were not to be worshipped.

THE 26. ARTICLE. Of Purgatory and Lymbus Patrum.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
Besides heaven and Hell there is Purgatory, to wit a place or middle state
after this life wherein the souls of many faith full, for their venial sines
or negligence and intermission of due satisfaction for their mortal sins, are
purged more fully by suffering a temporal punishment before they pass from
thence unto Paradise and the possession of the joys of heaven.

FATHERS.
S. Cyprian anno 240. says: lib 4 epist. 2.
It is one thing to be purged a long time for sins by torment and clarified by
a long fire and an other thing to purge all sins by passion and sufferinge.

Origin anno 230. says: hom. 6. in Exodus
he that is saved is saved by fire, so that if a man have some thing mixed with
lead, that the fire does purge and resolve, that all may become pure gold.

S. Gregory Nyssen. anno 380. says: Orat pro mortuit.
either being purged in this present life by prayers, and the studier of
wisdom, or having made satisfaction after his death by the furnace of the
purging fire, he would return to his former felicity: Et infra: having left
his body he cannot be made partakers of gods divinity unless the purging fire
take away the spots mixed in his mind: And again: others after this life
purge their spots by the fire of purgatory.

S. Gregory Nazianzen, anno 380. says: Orat. In ^lumina.
they shall be Baptized in their other fire, which is the last baptism, neither
is it only more crueller but also longer which does feed on hard matter like
iron and does consume the lightness of vice.

S. Basil anno 380. says: in cap 9. Esaiae.
if therefore we have made known our sin by confession we have already
made the growing grass to wither, which certainly the fire of Purgatory would
have o^csumed and devoured: Et infra. he does not theaten utter ruen and
destruction, but shows the purgation according to the Apostle. 1. Cor. 3.1^
But him self shall be saved yet so as by fire.

S. Eusebius anno 520. says: Eusebius Enis. leatus hom. de Epiphania.
This infernal pain does exspect those who having omitted and not observed
their baptism shall perish forever but such as have done things worthy
temporal punishments shall pass through a fiery river through horrible
lakes of fire balls.

Lactantius anno 320. says: lib. 7. cap. 21.
whose sins shall exceed in weight and measure or number they shall be purged and
burnt.

S. Hilarie in Psalm. 11^. upon that the soul etc.
anno 350. says: The soul has coueted to desire the judgments of thy
justice we must under go a continual fire where in we must suffer grievous
punishme^tes for the cleansing of our soul from sines.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says. Upon that sinners have unsheathed the sword: in
Psalm. 36. in illud: ot upon that: sinners etc.
Although our lord will save his servants, we shall be saved by faith, yet so
not w^^hstanding as it were by fire: although we shall not be burnt, yet we
shall burn: after which manner not withstanding some remain in the fire,
others pass through, in an other place (says he) the holy Scripture does
teach us, to wit, that the people of Aegipt were drowned in the red Sea, but
that the pople of Israel passed over. Moses passed over, Pharoe was thrown
down headlonge because his grievous sins drowned him, after the same manner
(says he) shall the whicked be thrown down headlonge into the lake of
burning fire.

Again he says: in locum D. Pauli 2. Cor. c. 3.15.
But when Paul says, but so as by fire, he shows truly that he shall be
saved, but he shall suffer the pains of fire, that being purged by fire he may
be saved, and that he may not as infidels be tormented in everlasting fire for
ever.

S. Hierome anno 380. says: lib. 1. contr. Pelagianos
But if Origin say that all reasonable creatures shall not perish, and that the
Devil shall do pemaunce, what is that to us, who say that the Devil and his
officers together with all impious and whicked people shall perish for ever,
and that Christians which are taken away in sin shall be saved after pains.

Again: As we in fine comment. in Esa.
think (says he) the torments of the Devil and all deniers of the faith and
wicked men, who say in their heart their is no God, to be eternal, yet
notwithstanding we think the sentence of the judge of Christians, whose
works are to be proved and purged by fire, to be moderate and mixte with
clemency.

S. Paulinus anno 400. says: Epist. 1. ad Amandum.
for this we earnestly beseech you, that as a brother you would under take the
labors of praying, that God would comfort his soul with the drops of his
mercy by your prayers.

lib. 21. de cl^^t Dei cap. 16.
S Augustine anno 400. speaking of infants dying presently after Baptism says:
He is not only not prepared for eternal pains, but also he does neither
suffer any Purgatory torments.

Again cap. 14.
speaking of the aged faithful who not withstanding depart in some small sins
he says: For such it is manifest being purged before the day of judgment by
temperall pains, which their spirits suffer, that they shall not be delivered
to the punishments of eternal fire.

Again: homil. 16.
These who have done things worthy temporal pains, shall pass through a
certain Purgatory fire where of the Apostle speaks: He shall be saved yet so
as by fire.

Again: lib. 2. de Genes. cont. Manich* cap. 20.
Who soever does not husbandry his field, but let it be oppressed with thorns
he has in this life the curse of his land in all his works, and shall have
after this life either a fire of purgation or eternal pain.

Again: lib. de ver^ and falsa po^nitentia.
He that deferreth the fruit of his conversion unto an other age or world is to
be purged by the fire of purgation, but this fire although it be not eternal
yet it is wonderful grievous and terrible, for it exceeds all pain that
ever any man suffered in this life.

See the Adversaries consent in prayer for the Dead. LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther in the beginning of his defection from the Sea of Rome does Catholikly
admit and manifestly confess Purgatory saying: in disput, lipsica.
I (says he) who earnestly believe, yea dare say that I know there is
Purgatory, and easily persuaded, there is mention of it in the Scriptures.

But not long after he changes his opinion and says: in libro ad waldenses
de Eucharistia.
When you deny Purgatory you condemn Masses, Watchinges, Cloisters,
Monasteries, and whatsoever is erected by this wickedness, all which I approve
off. lib. de abroganda M^ssa priuata.
Finally in an other place he takes it clean away, and says it is better to
believe there is no Purgatory then to give credit unto S. Gregory declaring the
apparitions of souls craving succor.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: lib. 3. instit ap. 5.. 6.
But for as much as Purgatory is framed of many blasphemies, and daily
strengthened by new inventions, and does also sture up many and grievous
offenses, we must not winck at it, therefore we must cry out, not only with
our voice, but with full mouth and whole force that Purgatory is a poysonfull
invention of Satan, which does make frustrate the cross of Christ brings
great reproach, not to be borne withal, to the mercy of God, and which does
corrupt and overthrow our faith. Et infra: what shall I say, but that
Purgatory is ameere, yea and that horrible blasphemy? I omit the
sacrilegious arguments whereby it is daily defended, we see the damage which
it breeds in religion, with innumerable other things proceeding from such a
fountain of impiety: See more in Prayer for the dead concerning Lymbus Patrum.

An old condemned Heresy.
Aerius, (as witnesses Epih. her. 75 and S. Au^ 1.
S. Epiphanius and S. Austine) seems to be the first that denied Purgatory
teaching that we ought not to pray for the dead. G^ do in ^na^a de here^^cis
and S Bernard. Ser. 66. in Cat^ica. Epist. 240. S Anton 4. part tit. 11. cap.
7.
The waldenses plainly denied Purgatory lykwise, and a little before them the
Apostolickes the same also almost at the same time taught Henry and Peter
Bruis, against whom lykwise writ S. Bernard. But the Albigenses denied both
hell and Purgatory as witnesses S. Antoninus.

THE 22. ARTICLE. Prayer for the Dead.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
The prayers and intercession of the liueing do help and profit the dead
therefore it is piously and religiously ordained and instituted by the
Catholic Church to pray for the faithful deceased.

SCRIPTVRE.
Ecclesiast. cap. 8.16.1^
SOn upon the dead shed tears, and begine to weep as having suffered doleful
things in the repose of the dead make the memory of him to rest.

Ibid cap. 7 v. ^7.
The grace of a gift is in the sight of all the liueing, and from the dead stay
not grace.

^ Mach^b. cap. 12. v 43.44 45.46.
And making a gathering he sent twelve thousand drachmees of silver to
Jerusalem for a sacrifice to be offered for sin, well and religiously thinking
of the resurrection for unless he hoped that they which were slain should
rise again, it should seem superfluous and vain to pray for the Dead, and
because he considered that they which had taken their sleep with good lives,
had very good grace laid up for them it is therefore a holy and health^ull
cogitation to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.

FATHERS.
lib ^. constit. cap 48.
S. Clemens anno 68. did write a long prayer accustomed to be said for the
Dead.

S. Dionysius Areopagita anno 80. says: lib de Eclesiast. Hierar cap. 7. part.
^.
after the venerable prelate approaching, he powers forth his holy prayer upon
the Dead, by that prayer he does beseech the divine clemency, to for give all
the sins of the Dead committed through humane infirmity, and to place him in
light and in the region or king dome of the liueing.

lib de corona nul^tis.
Tertullian anno 200. numbereth prayer for the dead amongst the traditions of
the Apostles. And speaking of one haueing buried her husband faith. lib de
Monogenna.
Let her pray for his soul and also crave comfort for him and a fellowship in
the first resurrection and make an offering upon the yearly days of his death,
for unless she shall do this, she has truly refused him, for as much as
lies in her.

S. Cyprian anno 240. says: lib. 1. epist. 9.
The Bishops our predecessors judged it fit that no brother departing this
world should nominat any clergy man to have care or tutorship of any one, and
if any did foe, that their should be no oblation made for such an one, nor
sacrifice celebrated for his departure and rest. Et infra: And therefore seeing
Victor Geminius, contrary to a formale act lately set forth in a council by
priests, has presumed to constitute Geminius Faustinus as tutor (in such a
business, let there be no oblation or prayer offered for his peace or rest.

S. Basil anno 380. in his liturgy ordained prayer for the dead.

S. Gregory Nazianzen. anno 380. says: in oratione in Casarum propefinem.
let us commend to god both ours and their souls, they being as now more ready
in the way having come first unto their Inn or lodging.

S. Ephrem anno 380. says. in suo testamento.
Make daily memory of me in your prayers, for I have ledd my life in vanity
and iniquity.

S. Cyrill anno 350. Hieros. says: Cathechesi. 5.
we pray for all that have declared this life, amongst us, belieueing the help
of those souls to be chiefest for whom the oblation of that holy and fearful
sacrifice is offered.

Eusebius anno 330. says: lib. 4 de vita constantin: imperatoris.
that Constantine would be buried in a fane Church to the end he might be
partaker of many prayers.

S. Epiphanius anno ^90. condemns Aerius for an heretic, saying against him
in defense of prayer and oblation for the dead: li 11. 75.
The Church has received (the) through the wide world: it was agreed upon
before Aerius was: the same says S. Austine, where upon M. Fulke says: in his
ansuer to a counterfayt Cathol page 44.
Aerius taught prayer for the dead was un profitable, as witanes both.
Epiphanius and Austine which they esteem for an error.

S. Chrysostom anno 380. says. homil 41. in 1. Cor.
Let the dead be succored, not by tears but by prayers, supplications and
alms deades. Et infra: Let us not be weary of helping the dead, offering up
our prayers for them.

Again homil. 69. ad Populum Antiocheum
These things (says he) were not rashly ordained by the Apostles, that their
should be commemoration made of the dead in these dreadful mysteries, for they
know that thereby much gain and profi^t does redound unto them.

Again: homil ^4. in Ioannem.
But let us have such care of the dead th^^ it may make both for us and them,
unto the glorius of God: Let us give large alms for them, let us send, them
the best provision.

Again: homil 21. in act 2. Apost
Therefore if we make continual prayer for him, if we give alms, and if we
be worthy, God will be the better pleased with us, moreuer (says he) if he saved
some by Paul, and spared others for others, why shall he not do this for us?

Again: homil. 2 In epist ad Philip in morali circa med.
let us weep for them, let us help them with all our power, let us procure
the^ some help not withstanding let us help them how? by what means? by praying
and exhorting others also that they likewise pray for the^ and by giving large
alms for them to the poor for that brings great comfort: Et Paulo post: It
was not in vain ordained by the Apostles that there should be memory made of
such as have departed this life, in the celebration of the venerable mysteries.
They know well that from hence there would come much comfort and profitt unto
them, all the people standing lifting their hands unto heaven, with the whole
clergy, and the venerable sacrifice being offered, how should it be that we
praying for them in this sort, should not please God. But we speak this of
them that have departed in faith Et infra. Therefore even as we pray for such
as live who nothing differ from the dead, so is it lawful to pray for the
Dead.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says of the death of Faustinus his Sister: lib. 2.
epist. 9 ad Faustinum.
therefore I do not think her so much to be deplored and lamented as to be
prayed for, neither to be sorrowed for by thy tears, but rather I think her
soul commended to God by thy offeringes.

in epist. ad Pammachium.
S. Hierome anno 380. speaking of the death of Paulina w^fe to Pammachius says:
other husbands sprinkle violts, roses, lilies and purple flowers upon the
sepulcher of their wifes. But our Pammachius does water the holy ashes and
venerable bones with the balm of alms, by these payntinges and smellinges
does he cherish the resting ashes, knowing it is written, that as water does
extinguish fire, so does alms extinguish sin.

S. Paulinus anno 420. commending the soul of his brother to Delphinus a Bishop
says: S. Paulinus Nolanus in epist 5. ad Del^h number Episcop^m.
endeavor to obtain by thy prayers that his soul may receive one drope of
comfort or refreshing, distilling from the least of thy sanctity.

S. Austine anno 400. says: S Austine de cura promortius cap 2
we read in the book of Machabees that there was sacrifice offered for the
Dead, but if it were no where read in the old scripture the authority of the
whole Church which is clear in this custom, is not small, where also
commendation of the Dead has it place in the prayers of the priest, which arre
powered out unto our lord God at his Aultor. And again: cap. 4.
supplications for the spirits of the dead arre not to be omitted which the
Churh has provided for to be made for all that dye in the Catholic and
Christian Society although their names be concealed, so that such as want
parents, sons, kinsfolk, or friends, may, notwithstanding receive this
benefit, by their holy and common mother the church.

Again: de Ciult^ Dei. l. 20. c. 25.
It is not to be doubted (says he) but that the dead are helped by the prayers
of the holy church, and the healthful sacrifice, and alms that are employed
for their souls, that God will deal with them more merciful, then their sins
deserve.

Again: Enchirid c. 110.
It may not be denied (says he) but that the souls of the deceased are
relieved by the piety of their liueing frindes, when for them is offered the
sacrifice of the mediator etc.

S. Gregory anno 590. says. lib 4. Dialog c. 55.
The oblation of the wholosome host, is wont to help souls after death very
much, so that often times deceased souls themselves do seem to crave the
same. Again: cap. 50.
This does profit the dead, whom grievous sins do not depresse and charge, to
wit, if they be buried in the church, because their neighbors as often as
they come to the said holy places, do remember them whose Sepulchers they see
and do power out their prayers for them.

THE ADVERSARY.
in his plain demonstrat that our Browmist. be full Donatistes etc. page ^3.
M. Gyssord affirms that even in the churches public worship, to pray for
the souls of the dead, and to offer oblation for the dead was generally in the
church long before the days of Austine, as appears in Cyprian and
Tertullian, who were before him, and nearer the time of the Apostles.

Instit. lib. c. 5. sec. 10.
Calvin acknowledges that one thousand and three hundred years since it was a
castome to pray for the dead. (And a little after he says) but I confess they
were drowned in error.

M Fulke. terent^e etc p. 106 and conf^t of Purgat. p. 78. 20 326 and 34^. 30^.
3^2. 393 and 194.
M. Fulke affirms that it prevailed with in the first three hundredth years
after Christ, and also says that Ambrose allowed prayer for the dead, and that
it was the common error of his time also that Austine blyndly defended it, and
Chrysostom and Hierome approved the same, yea that Tertullian, Cyprian,
Austine, Hierome and a great many more do witness, that Sacrifice for the Dead
is the tradition of the Apostles.

that prayer and alms were made for the dead almost from the very beginning of
the church. Chemnitus likewise confesses as much, yea generally this point of
sacrifice for the dead is so confessedly ancient that our learned adversary
M. Ascham is forced to say, that no first beginning thereof (since the Apostles
times) can be showed likewise prayer, for the dead is acknowledged to be taught
in the wrytinges now extant under the name of Dionysius Areopagita mentioned in
the Acts of the Apostles, witness M. Fulke where he thinks that Dionysius
lived in the ^^^e of Origin.

Chemnitius affirms that Dionysius teaches prayer to be made in the temple
for the dead.

M. D. Bridges Lord Bishop of Oxford says: I take this Dionysius to have bine
before Basil sc. anno 380.

Whereas it is usually objected against, this book that if it had bine the
writing of Dionysius, then Eusebius or Hierome would have mentioned it, this
confessed antiquity thereof before their times avoideth that objection which is
no less plainly discharged by Eusebius and Hierome themselves who signify
that the books of sundry writers were unknown to them.

M. Sutcliff says: that Dionysius is certainly the best witness of antiquity,
for he seems to be most ancient etc.

M. Oliver Ormerode says: I refer you to Tertullian, Iustine, Martyr,
Cyprian etc. but what do I cite these Fathers? Dionysius Areopagita, who lived
in the Apostles time makes mention of the Cross in Baptism

In like manner concerning Lymbus Patrum whereas tom. 1. l. 4. de Christi
anima. c. 14.
Cardinal Bellarmine alleges in proof thereof the plain testimonies of
the Greek Fathers Iustine, Irenaeus, Clemens, Origin, Eusebius, Basil,
Nazianzen, Nissen. (Epiphanius Chrysostom etc. And of the Latin Fathers:
Tertullian, Hyppolitus, Cyprian, Hilarie, Gaudentius, Prudentius, Ambrose,
Hierome, Ruffinus, Augustine, Leo, Vulgentius etc. our adversary Danau^
answers to their testimonies saying. ad Roberti^ Bellarm. disput. part. 1.

As concerning them they were not instructed out of Gods word neither do they
confirm their opinion by it, but only by their own conjectures etc.

In like plain manner does M. Jacob affirm saying: All the Fathers with one
consent affirm, that Christ delivered the souls of the Patriarchs and
Prophets out of Hell at his coming thither, and so spoiled Satan of those that
were in his present possession.

M. Whitaker answers to Duraeus testimonies from the Fathers concerning this
point of ^ymbus Patrum saying: what thou can not overcome by scripture, thou will without doubt effect by the testimonies of Fathers, concerning which that
I may answer freely and briefly what I think one little sentence of scripture
is of more force with me then a thousand Fathers without scripture, therefore
you shall not expect, that I do in particular confute these errors.

M. Barlovv says: in his defense of the a^^icies of he Protestant. relig on
page 17^.
This passes most rise amongst the Fathers, who taking in inferis) for
Abraham: bosom expound it, that Christ went thither, to convey the Fathers
deceased before his resurrection into the place where now they are,

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther at the first permitted and approved of intercession and prayer for the
dead, saying, Sermo. in festo omnium sanctorum.
if it please thee to pray for the souls of thy parents, thou may do this
at whom etc. praying in this manner, Ah. God if the state of this soul be
such, that it may be succurred by our prayers, O God be merciful unto it and
help it.

Again, Sermon. super Euang. de diuite and La^aro.
the fourth question (says he) is whether we ought to pray for the Dead,
because there is no mention in the Gospel of a middle state between
Abrahames bosom, and Hell, for as much as being in Abrahames bosom they need
no prayers, but being in Hell they can receive no fruit from thence: to which
question we must answer, we have no precept from God that we should pray
for the Dead, wherefore he does not sin that does not pray for them, no
mortal man can offend in that, which God neither has nor would command. But
for as much as God has not made known to us what is the state of souls, and
we are uncertain how God deals with them, so that we neither can nor will
make them sinners that pray for them for we are certain out of the Gospel
that many have risen from the Dead, who we are forced to confess that they
have not as yet received their last judgment. Ibid. it is no offense, if thou
pray for that soul, yet let it be after that manner, that thou leave it
uncertain, and say, most merciful God, if the soul be in that state, that it
may be succurred and helped, vouchsafe to be merciful unto it.

Again: in exposit. Euang in die Epiph^cy matthew. 3.
hence is it that those fained souls did crave help by masses and such manner
of trifles, so that it is now come to pass that the Mass is grown to that
abuse, and so many masses and vigiles are said for the dead as this misery and
abomination cannot be sufficiently deplored and lamented.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
lib. 3. cap. 5,. 10.
When (says he) the adversaries object to me, that to pray for the dead was an
use received one thousand and three hundred years since certainly any man but
of mean wit, may easily know, that whatsoever is read concerning this in the
ancient Fathers, is attributed to public custom and the foolishnes of the
common people they were I confess also led into error to wit in so much that
in considerate belief is wont to deprive men's minds of judgment etc.
Augustine relates in his books of confession that Monica his mother did
earnestly entreat him, that she might be remembered at the aulrer in
celebrating the mysteries. forsooth an old wives desire which the son does
perform not according to the rule of Scripture: but for affection will have it
approved of by others, but his book written by him of the care of the dead
has so many doubtinges, as through it own couldnes it ought worthily to
extinguish the heat of foolish zeal in any one that shall desire to be a
patron of the dead.

Again. Ibid.. ^
That which they allege out of the history of the Machabees concerning Judas
Machabeus, I think it not worth answer, least I seem to account that work
in the Catalogue of holy books, althouh Austine received it for canonical.
And a little after he says: That fact of Judas Machabeus was not without
superstition and a preposterous zeal.

The Aerian Heretics taught that we ought neither to pray nor offer Sacrifice

THE 28. ARTICLE. Ecclesiastical Tradition.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
Concerning the word of God part of it is written, and part is not written:
the written is called the holy Scripture or commonly the Bible. The not written
is called Apostolical or ecclesiastical tradition, because it co^temneth,
Scripture in it self, and does deliver it by voice, also because the church,
the pillar and foundation of truth does deliver it to posterity from hand to
hand.

SCRIPTVRE.
Ecclesiastic^^. 8.11.
Let not the narration of the ancients escape thee, for they learned of their
Fathers, because of them thou shall learn understanding, and in time of
necessity to give answer.

Deuteronomy. 32. v. 7.
Remember the old days, think upon every generation: ask thy Father and he
will declare to thee: thy elders and they will tell thee.

1. Cor. 11.34. and cap. 10 v. 16.
And the rest I will dispose when I shall come [which catholics understand to
be certain ceremonies that he ordained in the church, which are no where
written.

2. Thessa. 2.15.
Therefore Brethren stand: and hold the tradictio^s, which you have learned,
whether it be by word or by our epistle.

Hebr. 13. v. 7.
Remember your prelates, who have spoken the word of God to you: the end of
whose conversation beholding, imitate their faith.

2. John. v. 12 See also. 3. John. v. 13.14.

FATHERS.
apud Eusebium lib. 3. hist. c. 36.
S Ignatius anno 100. does exhort all to stick to the traditions of the
Apostles: which traditions (says Eusebius) he does affirm that he himself
has lest behind for the more security.

cap. 1 Eccl. Hierarch.
S. Dionysius Areopagita anno 80. says: these our first captains of the
priestly office did deliver the chiefest and substantial things by their
institutions partly written and partly not written.

S Ireneus anno 106. says: lib. 3. cap 4.
what if there should rise a contention about some small question, ought we
not to have recourse unto the most ancient churches wherein the Apostles were
conversant and receive from them concerning this present question what is
certain and plain? But what, if the Apostles had not left us the Scriptures?
should we not follow the order of tradition which they delivered to them, to
whom they committed the churches? to which order of tradition many nations of
the Barbarians do assent and agree, and some of them that do believe in
Christ, having their salvation written in their hearts by the spirit, without
either character or ink, and keeping diligently the old tradition.

S. Clemens Alexandrinus anno 190 lib. de Paschate, vt est apud Eusebius. lib 6.
cap 11.
says: that the Brethren did wrest from him, to put down in writing, and to
deliver to posterity those things that had bine delivered to him only by the
voice of priests, successors to the Apostles.

Origin anno 230. says: in cap. 6. epist. ad Romans
The church received tradition from the Apostles, yea to Baptize children.

Again. homil. 5. in lib. Number.
There are many things (says he) in Ecclesiastical tradition or obseruatio^s
which all ought to do, notwithstanding the reason of them is not known to all.

Tertullian anno 200. says, lib. de Corona militis
Also thou will say that written authority ought to be craved in the obteyning
of tradition; let us search therefore whether tradition not written ought not to
be received, we will plainly deny it to be received, if there be no examples
of other observations, which we challenge out of a patronizing heart of custom
with the instrument or help of any scripture, or title of only tradition.

Afterward having numbered the ceremonies of Baptism and certain others, as
the sign of the cross, the yearly sacrifice for the dead, and such like; he
adds saying.

If thou crave the law of these and such like written disciplines, thou shall
find none. Tradition is given thee for an author, custom a conformer and says
an obseruer. lib pe praescrupt. h^eret.
Also he teaches that heretics are to be confuted not by scripture but
tradition.

S Cyprian anno 240. says: lib 1. epist. 12.
Also be that is Baptized ought to be anointed, but of this chrisme or oil
there is no mention in scripture, but only in tradition.

Again: lib. 2. epist. 3.
know (says he) that we are admonished, that in offering upon the chalice,
the tradition of our Lord is observed, neither may we do any other thing
then that, which our Lord has first done for us; that the Chalice which is
offered in his remembrance, be offered mixed with wine.

S. Eusebius anno 330. says. lib. 1. de demonst. rat. Euang. cap. ^.
Moses did write the law in tables not having life, but Christ writ the
documentes and observations of the new testament in minds endued with life,
but his disciples according to the will of their master commending their
doctrine to the ears or understanding of many, whatsoever things were
commanded by their perfect master unto men having as it were gone beyond
their custom; those things they delivered unto them that could take them, but
such things as they thought were agreeable unto men, that did as yet carry
souls subject unto affections and wanting reason, these things (I say)
co^forming themselves to the imbecillitie and weakness of many, they did
command partly by writing, partly without writing, to be kept and observed
as it were by ^ certain unwritten law.

S. Athanasius anno 340. says: lib. de decretis. Nil. Synodi.
behold we have demonstrated and showed that this sentence has been
delivered from hand to hand unto the Fathers each unto other but you, o new
Jews, and sons of Gaiphas, what progenitors or ancestors of your names can
you show?

S. Basil an. 380, says. lib. de Spiritu S. cap. 27.
The articles which are kept and preached in the church, we have the^ partly
out of vnwritte^ doctrine, and have received them brought unto us in a mystery
partly out of the tradition of the Apostles, both which have the same force
unto godliness, and no man that has but any mean experience of ecclesiastical
right, does contradict them.

S. Gregory Naz. anno 380. says: orat. 1. in Iulianuru
But greater and more excellent for the forms of those Churches which being
received by tradition we have kept until this day etc.

S Chrysostom an. 380 says: in 2 Thessalonians. 2.
It is manifest, that the Apostles have not delivered all things by their
epistles, but many things with out writing, but as well these as them are
worthy of the same credit.

Again. hom. 69. (...) Populum ^^^ti^chenum, and hom. 1. in epist ad ^ly^
(...).
It was not in vain (says he) instituted by the Apostles, that of such as had
departed this life, their should be memory made of them in celebrating the
venerable mysteries for they did know that from hence their did come much
profit and commodity unto them.

S. ^piphamus anno ^90. says, (...). 55. quae est Melchisedecianoru^.
there are limits prescribed us, and foundations, for the edification of
says, as the Apostles traditions, holy scriptures, and successions of
doctrine, whereby the truth of God is strengthened on every side so that no man
can be deceived by fables or, tales.

Again: (...). 61. quae est Apostolicorum.
we must (says he) use tradition, for we cannot have all things out of holy
scripture, where for the holy Apostles delivered some things by writing, and
other some by tradition.

lib contra-constan^^um Imperatore^.
S. Hilary anno 350 says answearing an Arian prince who said (I will not have
words that are not written.) This I ask (says S. Hilary) what Bishop does
command it, who does forbid the manner of Apostolical preaching? speak
first, if you think it well said, I will not have new medicines against new
poisons.

epist ad Marcellam de erroribus Montani.
S Hierome says anno 380. we at a fit time fast one lent according to
Apostolical tradition.

Again when an Heretic had said, (many things that are observed in churches
by tradition, do usurp to themselves the authority of the written law:) The
Catholic answered: in Diologo con (...) Lucisctianos.
indeed I do deny but that this is the custom of churches, but what manner of
thing is that, that thou do transfer, or adioyne the laws of the church
unto heresy?

S. Augustine anno 400 says lib. 10. de Genesi cap. 2^.
The custom of our mother the church in Baptizing infants ought not to be
despised, or in any sort be thought superfluous, neither were it to be believed
unless it were Apostolical tradition.

Again: lib. 2. de Baptismo contra Donatistas cap. 7.
which custom (says he) I believe proceeded from Apostolical tradition, as
many things are not found in their writings, nor in latter councels, yet
because therefore kept and observed by the whole church, they are thought and
believed to have bine delivered and commanded by them. Again: lib. 5. cap. 23.
The Apostles indeed commanded no such thing but that custom which was
opposed to Cyprian, ought to be believed to have taken his beginning from their
tradition, as there are many things which the whole church does hold and for
this are rightly believed to be commanded by the Apostles, although they are
not found written.

Again: lib. de virit. Eccles. c. 15.
here peradventure thou will say; read how Christ commanded them to be
received, that would paste from heresy unto the church, this neither do I,
nor you manifestly read etc. therefore because it is no where read we must
believe the testimony of the church, which Christ testifies to be true.

Again. epist. 111.
But those things which we keep not written, but delivered, and which indeed
are kept through the whole world, are given to proceed either from the Apostles
or general councels, whose authority in the church is most wholesome,
commanded, and ordained to be kept, as that the passion of our Lord,
Resurrection, Ascension into heaven and coming of the holy ghost from heaven,
is celebrated with an yearly solemnity.

THE ADVERSARY.
Whereas S. Chrysostom says that the Apostles did not deliver all by writing,
but many things without, which are as worthy credit as the rest, M. whitaker
de Sacra Scriptura pa. 678.
M. Whitaker answeareth no otherwise thereunto then by saying. That it is an
inconsiderate speech, and not worthy so great a Father.

Also whereas S. Epiphanius says: we must use traditions for the scripture
has not all things, because the Apostles delivered certain things by
writing and othersome by tradition, with whom agrees S. Basil as aforesaid
to whom in his conclusions annexed to his conference the 1. conclu. page 689.
M. D. Raynoldis answeareth saying: I take not upon me to co^troll them, let
the church judge, if they considered with advise enough etc.

Concerning the fathers of the Latin Church S. Austine only (being most
approved by our adversaries as in the beginning of this treatise) shall serve
for all, who is so plain and evidently confessed by our adversaries that See
him in M whitgistes defense etc. page 103.
Carthweight says: to allow S. Austines saying is to bring in Popery again.
And that if S. Austines judgment be a good judgment, then there be some things
commanded by God, which are not in the scriptures: and there upon no sufficient
doctrine is contained in the scriptures.

To that former saying of S. Eusebius M whitaker de Sacra Scriptura. pa. 668.

M Whitaker answeareth saying: That this testimony is plain enough, but in no
force to be received because it is against the scriptures. Add now but
hereunto that Chemnitius does reprove, for their like testimony of unwritten
tradition Clemens Alex. Origin, Epiphanius, Ambrose, Hierome, Maximus,
Theophilus, Basil, Damascen etc. That M. Furke also confesses as much of S.
Chrysostom, Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Hierome etc. And lastly that M.
Whitaker acknowledges as much of all these Fathers.

See the 10. article where necessity of tradition is very plainly confessed
which is here omitted fol. 15.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says: in comm. cap. 1. ad Galat.
neither ought any other doctrine be taught and heard in the church, then the
pure word of God, that is: the holy scripture: for Doctores, or other Authors
with their doctrine let them be accursed.

Again: tom. 7. ger. fol. 29.
here in this place I will repeat my grown work or foundation where upon I
rely, which ought infallibly be kept of all, to wit, that all things which are
done without the scripture specially in things perteyning unto God, do
proceed from the Devil. And: lib. de ser^^ arbitrio.
we receive nothing but the holy scriptures.

in locis comm. de liberate Christian.
Melanchthon calls tradition for the invocation of Saints, simple life, and
all such like, that are not written, the doctrine of Devils, Et ibidem: more
over also (says he) when trad^^ions speak of things of their own nature yet
they become wicked and the doctrine of Devils in respect of errors, which are
also propounded and defended, to writ. That they merit remission of sins, that
works whereby God shows himself to be honored, are the worship of God, or
that Bishops have power to institute such worships.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: lib 4. instit. cap 8.. 8.
Let this then stand for a maxim or general ground. That no other then the
word of God ought to have place in the Church, which word is contained first in
the law and the Prophets next in the Apostles writings.

Agiane: ca. 10.. 8.^
therefore we account all constitutions or decrees wicked, in whose observation
the worship of God is feigned to be placed.

Agiane: 9.
ordinances which they call ecclesiastical, where with the Pope and his
clergy burden the Church, we say they are pernicious and wicked: but our
Adversaries defend them to be holy and wholesome.

Again:. 18.
But now to refer the beginning of traditions to the Apostles, where with
hither to the Church has been oppressed, was a mere forgerie or falls hood.

. 19.
But they object this has been an ancient opinion that what was done with one
consent in the universal Church, has always been thought to proceed from
the Apostles them selves: for which they Cite Augustine, as a witness: who says
that those things which are observed through the whole world, may well be
thought to have been ordained by the Apostles them selves or General
Counsels whose authority in the church is most wholesome;) ^0.
but that I may not be troublesome I will produce only one example if any man
ask them from whence they have their holy water, presently they answer, from
the Apostles; as if histories do not attribute this invention to I know not
what Bishope of Rome etc. Ibid. what soever it be I will never grant that this
came from an Apostolical Spirit etc. nether do I respect it that else where
the same Augustine does ascribe other things also to the Apostles; for because
it has nothing but conjectures, they ought not to give their judgment of so
great a matter.

Again: ^7.
this always is only to be excepted in these observations of the Apostle Paul
(that all things be done decently and in order) least they be thought either
necessary unto salvation, and so bind consciences with religion, or be
referred to the worship of God, and so there may seem to be some piety in them.

An old condemned Heresy.
August. (...) cap. (...) con^ (...).
The Arian Heretics would by no means receive the traditions of the church and
unwritten word of God, as Maximinus himself an Arian Bishop teaches; which
heresy afterward many others imitated, as Nestor, Dioscorus, Eutyches etc.
as you may see in the seventh Synod. (...).


THE 29. ARTICLE. Of the 7. Sacraments.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
All the Sacraments of the new testament, to wit; Baptism, Confirmation,
Eucharist, Penance, Extreme unction, Order, and Matrimony, in number Seven,
are instituted by God himself, and contained written in his word.

SCRIPTVRE. Baptism.
John. 3.5.
Unless a man be borne again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God.

Confirmation.
Acts c. 8.17 read also cap. 19.6.
Then did they impose their hands upon them and they received the holy ghost.

Eucharist.
John. 6.51.
If a man eat of this Bread he shall live for ever.

Penance.
John. 20. v. 22.^^.
And he says to them receive ye the holy ghost whose sins you shall forgive,
they are forgiven, them, and whose you shall reteyne they are retained.

Extreme Unction.
Mark 6.13
And they did annoint many sick with oil and they were healed.

James 5. v. ^4.15.
Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and
let them pray over him annoynting him with oil in the name of our lord.

Order.
2. Tim. 1. v. 6.
Resuscitate (or stir up) the grace of God which is in thee, by the imposition
of my hands.

Matrimony.
Matthew. 19. v 6.
Which God has joined to gether let noe man separate^

Ephesians. 5.6.12.
This is a great Sacrament.

FATHERS.
But because Baptism and the Eucharist (or as you term it the lords Supper)
are acknowledged and received by all Heretics of these latter times for
Sacraments there shall need no further labor in proof of them, wherefore we
come unto the rest.

Confirmation.
lib de resurrection c^^^^s.
Tertullian anno 200. rancketh Confirmation in the same Order with Baptism and
the Eucharist saying: The flesh is washed, that the soul may be cleansed, the
flesh is anointed, that the soul may be sanctified, the flesh is signed, that
the soul may be fenced, the flesh is shadowed, by the imposition of hands,
that the soul may be nlightned with the spirit, the flesh does feed upon the
body of Christ, that the soul may be fatted with God.

Again: lib de praescriptor. haereticor.
he does Baptize certain, to wit belieuers and his faithful, there he does
sign his soldiers in the forhead. Again: lib. de Baptismo.
after the hand is imposed with benediction calling and inuiting the holy ghost.

S. Cyprian anno 240. says: lib. 1. epist. vlt.
he that is baptized must of necessity be anointed: Also speaking of Baptism
and Confirmation he says: lib. 2. epist. 1.
Then they may be sanctified, and be the sons of God, if they be borne in both
Sacraments.

The Author of the Sermons of Christ's Cardinal works says: Sermo de vnct.
Chrismatis.
By the benefit of this annoynting both divine wisdom and understanding is
given us; Council and strength does come from heaven, knowledge, piety, and
fear is infused by supernall inspirations, being anointed with this oil we
contend with spiritual wickedneses.

S. Pacianus anno 350. says: lib. de Baptismo.
sins are purged by the font; the holy ghost is infused from above by Chrisme;
But we obtain both by the hand and mouth of the prelate.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says: lib. 3. de Sacramentis ca. 2.
The spiritual sign follows, because it follows upon the forehead, that
their may be perfection when the holy ghost is infused at the invocation of the
priest. Again: lib. de initiandis mysterijs cap. 7.
keep what thou have received, God the Father has signed thee our lord Jesus
Christ has confirmed thee.

S. Hierome anno 380. after he had said Dialog. contra luciferianos.
that Bishops do give the holy ghost to the baptized by imposition of hands,
he adds. Do thou ask where it is written? in the Acts of the Apostles,
but although there were no authority of Scripture the consent of the whole
world in this matter might be for a praecept.

S. Augustine anno 400. speaking of confirmation and the chrisme, which is
accustomed to be used in it, says: lib. 2. cont. lit. Petil. cap. 104.
In this ointment Petilianus will interpret the Sacrament of crisme which in
respect of visible signs is holy, as Baptism it self is, but it may be in the
most wicked men. Et infra: discern therefore the holy visible Sacrament, which
may be both in the good and in the bad, to these for a reward, to them unto
judgment etc.

Penance.
Tertullian anno 200. says: lib de paenit.
In the entrance God placed the second penance, which lies open to all that
knock.

S. Cyrill anno ^50. says: lib. 12. in Joan c. 56.
sins are for given two ways, by the priests as the ministers of God, and by
Baptism and pennaunce.

S. Cyprian anno 240. says: S. Cyp. vel quicumque author est Ser. de ablutione
pedum
after Baptism, which for it reverence, does not permit to be iterated, thou
have renewed an other font.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says: 5. Ambr. lib. 1. de pae^^^. cap. 7.
why do you baptize If sins be not for given by a man? for as in Baptism
their is remission of all sins, neither does it make any thing whether this
right be given them by pennaunce or the font. Let priests challenge it, for one
and the same is in both mysteries.

S. Victor Viscensis anno 486. says. lib. 2 de persecut. wandal.
To whom do you leave us wretches whilst you go to your crowns? who shall
baptize these little ones in the ever lasting waters? who shall give us the
office of pennaunce, and loose us being bound, from the bonds of our sins by
the mercy of reconciliation? because unto you it is said, Matt. 18 12
What soever you shall loose upon earth etc.

S. Chrysostme anno 380. says: lib. 3. de Sacerdotio.
Neither only when they regenerate you, but also afterward they have power
to for give your sins.

S. Leo anno 440. says: Epist 9^. ad Theodor.
The manifould mercy of God does so help such as fall, that not only by the
grace of baptism, but also by the medicine of pennaunce, the hope of eternal
life is repaired.

S. Hierome anno 380. says. lib 1. contra Pelagian
Let him be redeemed by the blood of our Savior either in the house of
Baptism, or in pennaunce which imitateth the grace of Baptism.

Again: lib. 2.
That it is written, the blood of Christ does cleanse us from all sine, is to
be taken as well in confession of baptism, as in the clemency of pennaunce.

Again: Epist. ad Heliodorum.
God for bide, that I should speak any evil of them who succeeding the
degree of the Apostles do consecrate the Body of Christ with a holy mouth, by
whom also we are made Christians who having the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, do judge after a sort before the day of judgment.

S. Augustine anno 400. says: Epist. 180. ad Honorat.
when it is come to the extremity of those dangers, and that there is no
means of escaping do we not know what a great concourse of people there is
wont to be in the Church of both sexes and every age, some craving baptism,
others reconciliation, others also to do pennaunce it self, all crave
comfort, and the consecrating and giving of the Sacraments.

Again explicating that: In Psalm. 146^
Who heals the contrite in heart, and binds up their contritions, he says:
What are those bindinges temporal Sacraments.

S. Victor anno 456. says: lib. de pae^it. cap. 20.
Finally hearken to our lord in the gospel, and understand with what darts he
does stricke the sinner, that thou moist know in what great estimation he has
the Sacrament of Pennaunce.

Extreme Unction.
S. Innocentius 1. anno 402. speaking of the holy oil of the sick says:
Epist 1 ad Decenclum cap. 8.
This cannot be given to the not penitent, because it is a kind of Sacrament,
for to whom the other Sacraments are denied, how can one kind be thought to
be granted.

Can. 69. anno 325.
The Council of Nice makes plain mention of the oil of the sick, and does
distinguish it from the Chrisme and oil of such as are newly instructed in the
says, because there do follow many other particulers afterward.

The Council Cabilonense anno 580. speaking of this Sacrament says: Can. 4^.
The Fathers decrees do agree with the epistle of S James.

Can. 72. anno 322.
In the Council Wormatiense the decree of S. Innocentius the first is again
renewed.

witness Burchard. lib 4 can. 75. anno 140.
The Council Meldense commands that upon Thursday in the week of the supper
of our lord all parrish priests should receive their viol of holy oil of the
Bishope for the annoynting of the sick according to the tradition of the
Apostles.

Also Began. 8. anno 742.
the Council of Aquisgrane in the time of the Emperor Lodovvicke, does
admonish us, that this Sacrament be not neglected wherein the salvation of
health of the sick is contained.

Order.
lib de Eccl. Hierarch. cap 5. ordinandorum.
Dionysius Areopagita anno 80. writes Ceremonies of this whole Sacrament, and
does also sufficiently show, that it conferreth grace.

S. Chrysostom anno 380. says: lib. 3 de Sacerdotio.
Priesthood is used here on earth, but is to be numbered and placed in the
order of heavenly things: and that right worthily: for not any mortal man,
not an Angel, not an Archangel, not any created power, but the holy ghost
himself does dispose such an order.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says: lib. de dignitate Sacerdotal^, cap. 5.
man imposes his hand, God gives grace, the priest imposes his simple right
hand, God does bless with his almighty right hand.

S. Augustine anno 400. says: lib 2. contra Parmenianum cap. 11.
Let them explicate how the Sacrament of the Baptized cannot be lost, and how
the Sacrament of the ordained may be lost, for if both be Sacraments which no
man doubts why is that not lost, and this lost we must do injury to
neither Sacrament.

S. Leo the great anno 440. says to the Bishops of Mauritania speaking of
ordination Epist. 17.
who dare (says he) dissemble an injury committed against so great a
Sacrament?

lib 4. comm.
S Gregory the great anno 590. says upon the books of kings in the beginning,
speaking of the Sacrament of Order. He that is advanced, is well anointed
outwardly with the virtue of the Sacrament.

Matrimony.
S. Chrysostom anno 380. says: hom. 20. in Epist ad Ephesios.
It is a mystery in deed (the latins call it a Sacrament) and a great
mystery, he being left or forsaken who begotte him who nourished him, also
she that brought him forth that brought him forth with misery and labouer.
For a man to adhere unto her, whom he never saw before and to prefer her
befofe all others, truly it is a mystery.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says: comm. in cap 5 ad Ephesios
It signifies the Sacrament of that mystery in the uniting of man and woman
to be great.

Again speaking of him that desires an other man's wife, he says: lib. 1 de
Abraham cap. 7
And therefore because he sins against God, he loses the fellowshipe of
that heavenly Sacrament.

S. Augustine anno 400. says: lib 1 de (...) and concupisc. cap. 10
The Sacrament of wedloke or mariadge, is commended to the faithful that are
married: wherefore the Apostle says, husbands love your wyfes. Again: lib. de
bono coniugali cap 18
in our Mariadges (says he) the Sanctity of the Sacrament is of more worth
than the frutefullnes of the womb. Again: lib. de side and operibas cap. 7
In the City of God, in his holy mountain, that is, in his Church, not only
the band of wedlock, but also the Sacrament is commended.

Finally that there are more then two Sacraments in the Church this one
example of in Psalm 10. conc^o^ie 1. upon these words which ca^e rest the
higher par^^s thereof with waters v. 3.
S. Austine (to omit many other out of the same Author) may suffice saying:
Look upon the offices of the Church it self, the office of the Sacraments in
Baptism, in the Eucharist and the other holy Sacraments.

See the Adversaries consent where these Sacraments are handled in particular
here following.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says: tom. 2. witemberg anno 1562 de capti^. Babyl. fol. 84.
But thou will say: what say you to Dionysius Areopagita who numbreth six
Sacraments? etc. I answer. I know this man only of the old Fathers to stand
for the number of Seven Sacraments, although omitting Matrimony he grant six
only.

in initio lib. de capt. Babylonica.
Luther is so variable and unconstant in this matter, that one while he
affirms only one Sacrament an other while three, Baptism, the Eucharist, and
Pennaunce, and all this in one and the same book: lib. ad Porgenses de
instituendis minist^ls and lib. de missa priuata and in assert. cont louan.
published by himself the last year of his life and also assert. 53 he says vt
in textu.
But this his last opinion he repeateth in many other places, as in the
margent, insomuch that he says: we willingly confess that pennaunce with the
power or virtue of the keys absoluing, is a Sacrament, for it has the promise
and faith or grant of remission of sins for Christ.

l This latter also was the opinion of the ancient and true lutherans, as
witnesses the Apology of the Augustan confession, art. 13. and all the
lutheran Catechismes.

After the same sort wauereth in locis com. editis 1521. and 22. cap. de
signis: nunc tria, vt in Apolog. August. confessionis art. 13. nunc 4 vt in
locis com. anno 15 6. also 52 58. cap. de numero sacramentorum.
Melanchthon who being carried with the like whirlwind of Doctrine, now
ordayneth only two Sacraments, then three now again four, adding to the
three former, the Sacrament of order, and that in favor of the Caluinistes,
whom he labored to associate to his followers; because for a time the
Sacrament or Order seemed to Calvin to be truly and properly a Sacrament, as
we shall see hereafter where the words of Melanchthon are thus: it does
specially like me to add order as they call it, that is, the vocation unto the
ministry of the gospel, because by this evangelical command the promise
is commanded and added: where through the whole chapter he proves order to
be a Sacrament, notwithstanding the greatest part of Lutherans, that are
inclined to Caluinisme, do now at this day approve but two only.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: lib 9. cap. 18. 19.
readers have, collected in a brief compendium almost all those things, which
we have thought good to be known concerning those two Sacraments (to wit,
Baptism and the lords supper) Et ibid. as there is no other instituted by God
besides these two, so ought the Church of the faith full to acknowledge no other.

cap 14 20.
But a little before he does inculcate three Sacraments, where of two he says
are ordinary and ordained for the use of all men, one extraordinary and
agreeable only to the ministers of God. for says he; They being abrogated (to
wit they Jews) there are instituted two Sacraments which now the Christian
Church does use, to wit, Baptism and the lords supper. I speak of them
(says he) imposition of hands, whereby the ministers of the Church are brought
into their office, to be called a Sacrament although I do not number it
amongst the ordinary Sacraments.

Again: cap. 79.. 31.
there remains (says he) imposition of hands which in those that are truly
and lawfully ordained I confess it is a Sacrament.

Notwithstanding a little after he does again deny it, and most sacrilegiously
takes from the Church both this and the rest.

Concerning Confirmation, after he has expounded the sentence of the holy
Fathers he adds.

Ibid.. 4.
Although I do not deny but that Hierome was herein much deceived, in that he
said it was an Apostolical observation.. 5.
But this latter age the thing being almost bloted out, has putt I know not
what feigned confirmation for the Sacrament.. 12.
They pretend as they are accustomed, that this observation is most ancient,
and confirmed by the consent of many ages. Which although it were true, yet
they had effec^^d nothing.

Concer^^ng Pennaunce he Ibid. 14.
says now we will handle that, and see what reason they have that conceive an
opinyon of a Sacrament, which has reigned in Churches and schools long
before this. But how soever it be, we see that imposition of hands in
pennaunce is a ceremony, instituted by man and not by God, ^71
notwithstanding least they wax proud wherein soever they have placed a
Sacrament, I deny that it is lawfully taken for a Sacrament: Ibid. It is false
therefore and wicked which they invented of the Sacrament of pennaunce, they have
adorned this false Sacrament, as became it, with the title of secund table
after shipvvrake: because if any of you have by sinning corrupted that
innocence received in Baptism he may by pennaunce repair it again. But this
is Hieromes saying or whose soever it be, he cannot be excused, but it is
plainly impious and wicked, Et infra: in that Hierome did harsly and improperly
say Baptism was repaired by pennaunce, good interpreters do draw it to their
own impiety and harm.

Concerning Extreme Unction: 1^^
he says it is the third feigned Sacrament.

Concerning Order, being altogether forgetful of himself, he speaks in this
chapter far other wise then before, and concludes 33.
That it can be no Sacrament.

Concerning Matrimony: 34.
The last (says he) is Matrimony, which as all confess it is ordained by God
so no man unto the time of Gregory has seen it taken for a Sacrament: And in
the same place he compares it with husbandry, biulding, cobling, barbing etc.
which (says he) are the lawful ordinances of God, and yet are no Sacraments.

lib. (...) and (...). religione.
Zvvinglius although he do lykwise preach only two Sacraments, yet concerning
Matrimony he follows the common opinion, esteeming it either to be a
Sacrament or some thing more excellent and far better then a Sacrament.

THE 30. ARTICLE. The efficacy of Sacraments.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
The Sacraments of the new testament are not bare signs and tokens, which
signify only sanctity and justice, but are the true organs and means, which out
of their own force and virtue, not natural but supernatural out of the work
done, do justify and give grace and sanctity itself.

SCRIPTVRE.
Titu. ^.5.
He has saved us by the lauer of regeneration and, renouation of the holy
ghost.

Act. 8.1^.19.
And when Simon Magus had seen, that by the imposition of the hands of the
Apostles the holy ghost was given, he offered them money saying, give me also
this power, that one whom soever I impose my hands, he may receive the holy
ghost.

Act. 19.6.
And when Paul had imposed hands upon them, the holy ghost came upon them.

FATHERS.

S. Iustine Martyr anno 150. says: [wee obtain remission of sins in the water,
and therefore Baptism (says he) does perform and give it, not by signification
but operation.]

S. Clemens Alex. lib. 1. de Pedagog. cap. 6.
anno 190. says: [This work is called after many ways, as grace,
illumination, perfect, and lauare, a lauare by which we wash away sin: grace
whereby pains due to sin are forgiven: illumination, by which we be hold that
holy and wholesome light. Perfect, because it wants nothing, for what is
wanting to him that knows God] Cathechest. 3.
S. Cyrill anno 350. says: [Being dead thou do descend in thy sins, and
ascendest a live in justice, to wit, by the Sacraments,] wherefore speaking of
the Sacrament of Baptism he says: [Truly this proposed Baptism is great, the
freedom of captivity, the remission of sins, the regeneration of the soul,
the course to heaven.]

S. Ambrose anno 380. lib. 2. de Poenitientiae cap. 2.
says: [It did seem impossible that water should wash away sin, And Naaman
Syr^s did think that this leprosy could not be cleansed by water: but what was
impossible God made possible, who gave us so great a grace]

S. Gregory Nissen. anno 380. says: lib. de Baptismo.
Baptism is a full satisfaction or cleansing of sins, a remission of faults,
and cause of renewing and regeneration.]

S. Chrysostom anno 380. says: homil. ^9. in Genes. extrema.
[The same that Circumcision works there, in taking away the flesh, the same

S. Cyrill Alex. anno 430. says: lib. 2. in Joan. cap ^1.
[euen as water made very hot by the force of fire, does borne no less then
fire it self, so by the operation of the holy ghost water where with the body
of the baptized is sprinkled, is enriched with divine virtue and power]

S. Hierome anno 380. says: Epist ^3 ad Oceanum.
[what great force and grace Baptism and water sanctified in Christ have, I
will teach a little beneath:] Et infra: [a whole day (says he) will not
suffice me, if I would collect all things out of the holy scriptures that
perteine unto the Power of Baptisme]

S. Augustine anno 400. says: lib 19 co^t. Fanctum cap. 11.
[the force of Sacraments is unspeakable and invaluable which if it be
contemned, it makes men sacrilegious for that is wickedly contemned, without
which piety cannot be perfected.

The Author of the homily of the Sacrament of the body of our lord, which is
written amongst the homilies of Eusebius Emissenus, and in the 9. tome of S.
Hierome, says: [As the hight of the heavens, the depth of the waters, and
vastnes of the earth did suddenly at the beck of our lord of nothing subsist
and had a being: so virtue does give the like power to words in spiritual
Sacraments, and the effect does serve the thinge]

S. Gregory anno 590. says: lib 9 epist. 9 ad Theo^^st^m Patri^^m.
[he therefore that says, sins are not altogether or quite for given in
Baptism let him say that the Aegiptians did not truly die in the red see.]

Century-vvriters say, [that Iustine Martyne, Clement etc. thought regeneration
(not to be signified, but) wrought by baptism and the word, unto which two
joined to gether they attibute efficacy, that is to say, remission of sins,
for say they: Cyprian does not doubt to affirm that the person Baptisinge,
does give the holy ghost and sanctity outwardly to the Baptized etc.

tom. 2. de baptismo fol. 70.
Zuinglius says it was a great error in the old Doctors, in that they
supposed the external water of Baptism, to be of any value toward the
purging of sin.

loc.comm. page ^99.
Muscidus says: [ Augustine did inconsideratly affirm that the Sacraments of
the new testament do give salvation etc.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
[Wee say (says he) in assert, (...) articulorum Art. 1^
that neither the Sacraments of the new nor old testament, nor only faith did
justify.]

Again: lib cont. Cochlaerum
[There can no part of justification be attributed to baptism, other wise if
in any sort it should justify, it were not lawful to say that baptism could
not justify with out faith: [But when this is denied to Baptism it is very
well left to faith only] ibid. [But if there be any of the Fathers who thought
that Sacraments did by their own virtue justify, yea let it be Augustine, as
Cochlaus contendeth, I care not, they are but men's sayings, often times
contradicting them selves, and teaching for the most part after a humane sense
with out the Scriptures]

Again: lib. de capt. ^^. by (...) de baptismo cap.
[Baptisme justifies no man neither does it profit any, but faith in the word
of promise where unto baptism is added.] Et infra: [Neither can it be true
that Sacraments have in them an efficacious force of justification, or that
they are efficacious signs of grace, for all these things are spoken to the
prejudice of saith]

But in his latter Books he seems to think better, and in some sort to have
recanted for says he. homil 1 de Baptis circa principium
[to this end was baptism instituted, that it should serve us, not any
carnal, or corporal thing, but eternal grace, eternal purity, sanctity,
and eternal life]

Again: homil ^2 de Baptism.
[Baptisme cannot (says he) but work that for which it was instituted to
wit; regeneration, and renewing of spirit.] Et infra: [Iohn would signify by
these words, that Baptism is so efficacious and of so great virtue as it can
wash away sins, drown and choke death, and heal and cleanse all vice and
filthines]

Yet this efficacious working of the Sacraments, which some time the very
ignorant profess, they explicate to be done only by faith and for faith so
that Sacraments do profit such as actually believe, faith: so that Sacraments
do profit such as actually believe, and receive it by faith. Yea they say that
Sacraments work as a sign or picture: to show the faithful where Christ the
mediator is, as the bush shows where wine is to be sold.

For Kemnitius says: [That 2. part. examinis Conc. Trident. page 101 102. and
page 185.
the word and Sacraments show us where faith ought to seek, and where it may
find Christ the mediator, the Father, and holy ghost; for (says he) the
object of faith, is the word and Sacraments.]

Melanchthon says: lo comm. cap. designis.
[signes do not justify, as the Apostle says. Circumcision is nothing so
Baptism is nothing, but they are witnesses of the divine will toward the.]

Again: lib contra Anabapt.
[as the will of God is showed in his word or promise, so also in a sign as
in a picture.]

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
lib. 4. instit cap. 14.. 9.
Calvin says: [I would have the reader admonished that I do so assign that
ministry to the Sacraments, not as if I did think there were always
remagning in them some secret force or virtue I know not what, whereby they
should be able of them selves to increase or strengthen says, but because they
are established by our lord unto this end, that they should serve for the
strengthening and increase of faith.] Et supra:. ^.
[Sacraments have most clear promises, and more then the word, they have this
peculiare thing, that they do lively represent unto us the promises of God as
it were painted in a table, yea they are bare signs, which with out the
written word of God do profitt nothing, whereby it may briefly be answered,
they are as seals hung upon writtes or other public acts, which being taken
by them selves are nothing.]

Again: ^. 17.
[Wee must take heed (says he) least they lead us into an error kine, unto
this which for the amplifying or en larging of the dignity of Sacraments are
written a little more magnificently by the Fathers, to wit, That we should
think some hidden virtue to be annexed or adjoined to the Sacraments, whereby
they might of them selves confer unto us the gaces of the holy ghost, even as
wine is drunk out of a goblet, because this is as great a gift bestowed upon
them by God, to testify and assure unto us his love toward us, etc. For
Sacraments are the same unto us from God that messengers of joyful tydinges
are from men or pledges in making bargains, to wit, which indeed do not
give any grace of them selves, but do declare and show it.

Again:. 2^.
[peraduenture (says he) those immodest praises of the Sacraments, which are
read in the Fathers touching our signs have deceived those miserable
Sophisters like unto that of Augustine, who said, that the Sacraments of the
old law did only promise our Savior, but ours give salvation therefore because
they did not consider that such manner of speeches were hyperbolicall, they did
promulgate their hyperbolicall articles or doctrine etc. Also it is necessary
that readers should briefly be admonished of this thing, that what soever these
Sophisters triste concerning the very work done or bare receiving of the
Sacrament it is not only false, but does also contradict the nature of a
Sacrament.]

THE 31. ARTICLE. Of Baptism and the Necessity thereof.

unless a man be borne again of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God, says. [wee will diligently observe, chiefly against the
blind Anabaptists, who think the Baptism of children to be unprofitable and
to no end, but how can such a manner of baptism be unfruitfully, when as here
thou hear, that our savior has ordained water unto this end, that the holy
ghost concurring with it, it does work unto regeneration? Now if it be
necessary for children to be regenerate, or otherwise they cannot see the
kingdom of God, why should we deny them baptism?]

Again: [Is not this (says he) a great gift and glory, that a woman also in
time of necessity may baptize and say: I free thee from death, from the
Devil, sin and all evil; I give thee life eternal, I make thee of the son
of the Devil the son of God?]

All which have nothing contrary to the former opinions or sentences, but in
another place he says. in (...) oq. conuiualiby tit. de baptismo.
[That children although sometime they depart hence without baptism yet if
they be without their own actual fault they may be saved.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
lib. 4. instit. c. 15. 20.
Calvin says: [To know this also, pertains to the matter, that it is very
ill done if private men vsurp to themselves the administration of baptism.]
And a little after, [vvheras many ages since, yea almost from the very
beginning of the church, it was acustome, that in peril of death lay men
might baptize, I do not see by what good argument it can be defended, yea the
Fathers themselves who either held this custom or permitted it, could not
tell whether it were well done or not.] Et infra. [Let there be danger
least he that is sick do dye without baptism, what then shall he be
deprived of the grace of regeneration? no such matter.]

[Againe what evil has that article euilly expounded, brought in, that
baptism is of necessity unto salvation: few consider this and therefore they
care the less for it* for when that opinion did increase or waxed in force,
that all perished, that were not baptized, our state or condition became
worse then that of the ancient people.]

Again: 22.
[The example of Sephora is unhappily cyted: why? because it does indiscretly
draw unto the imitation of that which a foolish woman did] Ibid. [this would I
have readers only to attend, that Sephora did purpose nothing else, but to prove
the ministry of God* she seeing her son in danger, cries and makes a
noise and with great wrath did cast the prepuce unto the grovvnd: she does so
revile her husband that she is angry with God. Finally it is manifest that
all this proceeded from a simple understanding, in that she does rail at both
God and her husband, being forced to shed the blood of her own son, moreover
admit she had behaved her self well in all other things, yet this rashness is
inexcusable, because her husband being present she circumcised her son etc.]
And he concludes in the same place saying: [vvher upon it follovveth that the
children of the faithful are not therefore baptized, that they might then at
that instant become the sons of God, which were before alienated from the
church, but rather they are therefore received into the church by a solemn
sign, because through the benefit of the promise they did already before
perteyne unto the body of Christ] here you see that Calvin will have the
children of the faithful to be borne sanctified and Christians from their
mothers womb, and not by Baptism, agreeing herin most directly with the
Pelagian heresy.

An old condemned Heresy.
This was the Pelegian heresy, which taught, S. August. lib. 6. contra
Iulianum cap. 2. and 3. and lib. ad Bonifacium cap, 2. and 4.
[that there was no original sin in the children of the faithful, and that
they did not therefore need the lauer of regeneration or Baptism: but were
borne holy from the vvombe] witness S. Augustine.

THE 32. ARTICLE. Of the venerable Sacrament of the Eucharist.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE FOR THE REAL PRESENCE.
The true and lively flesh, that is, the Body and blood of Christ is the
nourishment of the souls of the faithful, and their spiritual and heavenly
meat, into which this earthly and element all bread and wine, is through the
benediction of Christ, and operation of the holy ghost, made transubstantiate;
not withstanding all the accidents of the former substance remaining.

SCRIPTVRE.
Matthew. c. 26 v. 26 re^d also M^rke c. 14.22 Luke 22 ^9. and 1. Cor 11 24.
Jesus took bread and blessed, and brake, and he gave to his disciples, and
said, take ye and eat, This is my Body, And taking the Chalice, he gave
thanks, and gave to them saying, drink ye all of this; for this is my blood
of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission, of sins. John
c. 6. v 53 54.55.56. etc.
Unless you eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, you shall
not have life in you. He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has life
everlasting, and I will raise him up in the last day, for my flesh is meat
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed etc. he that eats my flesh and drinks
my blood, abides in me, and I in him.

S. Ignatius, disciple unto S. John the Evangelist says: in epistola ad
Smyrnenses v^ citat. S. Theodoretus Dial. 3.
[They do not admit Eucharistes and oblations, because they do not confess
the Eucharist to be (that) flesh of our Savior, which suffered for our sins,

S. Dionysius Arcopagita anno 80. says: o most divine and holy Sacrament,
vouchsafe to open the coueringes of those significant signs which ouershadow

and clear shining of thy light.]

S. Iustine Martyr anno 150. says of the Eucharist: in Apologia ad Antominum.
[Wee do not take it, as common bread, nor this as common drink, but as by
the word of God, our Savior Jesus Christ was incarnatie, and took both flesh
and blood for our salvation, so also by the prayers of the word of God, we are
taught that the Eucharist (being made food by him whereby our blood and flesh
may be nourished by mutation) is the flesh and blood of the same Jesus
incarnate.

Tertullian anno 200. says: lib. 4 cont. Marcion.
[The bread which he took in his hand, he made his body saying. This is my
body.

Again: lib. de resurrect. carnis.
The flesh feeds upon the body and blood of Christ, that the soul may be
replenished or filled with God.

Origin anno 230. expounding the 25. the chapter of Exodus says, homil. 13. in
Exodus
I would have you to admonish others; you that are wont to be present at the
divine mysteries, know, that when you receive the body of our Lord, you keep
it withal watchfulnes and veneration least any little part thereof fall to the
grownd, least any little part of the consecrated gift slip away or fall; for
you believe that you are guilty of a great offense, and you do well to
believe so, if any part thereof fall through your negligence.]

Again speaking of the centurions child he says: hom 5. in diuersa loca
Euangelij. loquens de puero centurionis.
[when thou receauest the holy food and incorruptible banquet, thou eatest and
drinkest the body and blood of our Lord, then our Lord enters under thy roof,
thou therefore humbling thy self, imitate the Centurian and say: Lord I am not
worthy that thou should enter under my roof. For where he enters
unworthily, there he enters to judgment.]

S. Cyprian anno 240. says: in Sermon. in caena Domini in principio.
The supper being disposed amongst the Sacramental banquets, the old and new
institutions met together, and the lamb being consumed, which the ancient
tradition did propound, our master did set before his Disciples the
vnconsumable food. Et infra: this bread which our Lord delivered to his
Disciples being changed not in outward show, but in nature by the omnipotency
of the word, was made flesh and as in the person of Christ, the humanity
appeared and the divinity lay hidd, so the divine essence infused it self
ineffablie or vnspeakeablie into the visible Sacrament etc. The Doctrine of the
Sacrament is new, and the Evangelical schools have brought forth this first
instruction, and Christ our Doctor first taught the world the discipline; That
Christians should drink blood, the eating whereof the authority of the
ancient law most straightly forbideth; for the law forbideth the eating of
blood, the gospel commands it to be drunk.]

S. Hilary anno 350. says: lib. 8. de Trinitate,
[There must be no doubt concerning the verity of the flesh and blood, for
now, both by the profession of our Lord and our faith, it is indeed flesh and
indeed blood. Et mox: is not this the truth? it seems not to be ttue unto
them that deny Christ to be true God. Also explicating that of the six of S.
John: he that eats my flesh shall live through me etc. he says: [truly this
is the cause of our life, that we have Christ according to the flesh remaining
in us carnal men, who shall live by him as he lives by the father. Et infra:
thou say that the son of God temaineth in us carnally through the Eucharist.]

S. Cyrill of Hierus. anno 350 says Cateches. 4. Mystag.
[for as much as Christ himself thus affirms and speaks concerning the
bread. This is my body, who dare hearafter doubt of it? and for as much also
as himself confirms it and says: This is my blood: who I say can doubt of it
and say it is not his blood: Et ibidem, once he turned water into wine, which
is near unto blood, at his pleasure only in Canaan in Galile; and shall not he
be worthy to be believed, that he turned wine into blood? wherefore with all
assurance let us receive the body and blood of Christ, for under the form of
bread his body is given to thee, and under the form of wine his blood is given
to the. Et ibid so shall we be Christophori, that is bearers of Christ, when
we have received his body and blood into our members and we shall be made as S.
Peter says; partakers of the divine nature; thou must not consider it as bare
bread and wine; for it is that body and blood of Christ, according to our
Lords own words; for although thy sense make thee think thus, yet faith must
confirm thee, that thou judge not the thing according to the taste. Et infra:
knowing this and being most assured, that this bread which we see is not
bread, although the taste think it bread, but that it is the body of Christ,
and the wine which we see although to the sense of the taste it seem wine, yet
that it is not wine but the blood of Christ.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says: lib 4 de Sacramentis cap 4.
But this bread is bread before the words of the Sacrament, yet when the
consecration shall be adjoined, of bread it is made the flesh of Christ.

Again: lib de my^te^i^s m^^^^ndis c. 4.
[peraduenture (says he) thou will say unto me, I see another thing, how can
you assure me that I receive the body of Christ? now the^ it remains that we
prove it; therefore we will use most manifest examples, to prove that this is
not that which nature formed but that which the benediction has consecrated,
and that the force of the benediction is greater then the force of nature,
because by the benediction nature it self is also changed. Moses held a rod in
his hand, he cast it a way and it became a serpent. [Also having declared many
examples of Elias and Elizeus he concludes:] if the benediction of a man
prevailed so much that it converted nature, what shall we say of the divine
consecration it self, where the words of our Lord and Savior himself work,
for this Sacrament which we receive is made perfect by the speech of Christ,
and if the word of Elias prevailed so much that it brought down sier from
heaven, shall not the word of Christ be of sufficient power to chaung the
nature of elements? thou have read concerning the works of the whole world,
that he spoke the word and they were made, he commanded and they were
created, therefore the word of Christ which was able to make that which was
not, of nothing, shall it not be able to change those things which be, into
that which they were no^* for it is not a matter of less power to give new
natures unto things, then to chaung the natures of things.]

S. Basil anno 380. says: lib de Baptismo cap 9.
if such threatninges be pronounced against them, that rashly come to those
Sacraments or sacrifices which are sanctified by men, what shall we say of
him who is rash in receiving so great and divine a mystery, for how much, more
greater he is in the temple, according to the voice of our Lord, so much the
more greeuoue and t^^r be it is unto him that shall with an impure soul rashly
come unto the body of Christ, then it is to come unto bulls and rams etc.]

S Greg. Nyss anno 380. says: lib. de vlt^ Moses.
[where he disputes concerning the manner of the jews which he compares with
the holy Eucharist: That it is bread prepared for us, without seed, without
prayer, without any help of man: that bread falling down from heaven was found
upon earth; for the bread that comes from heaven, is our true food which is
figuratively signified in this history, it is not a thing wanting a body, for
how can a thing which is no body, become food for the body? but the thing that
wants not a body questionles, is a body.

Again: orat. Cat^. chist. cap. 36.37.
[as a little leaven (says he) makes a whole lump of dow like unto it self,
so also that body which is made immortal by God, entering into our body,
transposeth and changes it wholly into it self] Et pauso post: it is conjoined
with the bodies of the faithful, that by this conjunction with that which is
immortal, man also may be made partaker of immortality. Ibid. we must
consider how it may come to pass, for as much as that one body is continually
delivered to so many thousand of the faithful through out the whole world, it
passes wholly through, every man, and yet remains whole in it self]

Again: [wherfore we do also now truly believe that the sanctified bread by
the word of God, is changed into the body of God the word. Et pauso post:
these things (he does) by virtue of the benediction, changed the nature of
those things which are seen (meaning the bread and wine) into that (meaning
the body of our Lord):]

S. Optatus anno 370 says: lib. 2. Co^^. Pamenian^,
[what can be so sacrilegious as to break, raze, and remove the alters of God,
where upon your selves also sometime have madeoblation, where on the prayers of
the people and members of Christ were borne or sustained, where upon almighty
God was inuocated, from whence the holy ghost, being expected with great
desire, descends, from whence many men receive the earnest penny of their
eternal salvation and protection of their faith and hope of resurrection^ Et
mox, what is the alter but the seat of the body and blood of Christ? Et infra:
wherein did Christ offend you, whose body and blood sometime remained thereon?
Also: yet this heinous offense is doubled when you also break the Chalices,
the porters or carriers of the blood of Christ.]

S. Greg. Naz. anno 380. says: orat. 2. de Paschate.
[without trouble and doubt eat the body and drink the blood of Christ, if
thou be indeed desirous of life, neither do thou doubt of the truth of those
speeches which are uttered concerning the flesh, neither be thou offended at
the passion, be constant, firm, and established not doubting of any thing,
whatsoever the adversary say.

Again: orat. de obi^u Gorgoniae soron^. suae
[she fell down (says he) with faith at the altar, praying with great
feruencie unto him that is worshipped thereupon etc.

S Ephrem. an. 380. says: lib. de natura Dei mu^me. scrucanda ca. 5.
[why doste thou search things unsearchable; if thou examine these things
curiously, thou shall not then be accounted a man faithful, but curious: be
faithful and innocent, be partaker of the immaculate body of thy Lord with
fulness of faith, assuring thy self that thou eatest the whole lamb himself,
the mysteries of Christ are an immortal fire, do not thou rashly search them
out least thou be consumed in the search thereof. Et infra: This indeed
exceeds all admiration, all understanding, and all speech; which Christ the
only begetton son our Savior has done for us, he has given us fire and
spirit to be eaten and dronken, that is (as himself explicateth) his body and
blood.

S. Epiphanius anno 390 says: in Ancorato circa medium.
we see what our Savior took in his hands as the Evangelist speaks, that
he arose from supper and took these things, and when he had given thanks he
said: This is mine, this, and this, and we see that it is not of equal
bigness, nor like to his Image in the flesh, nor to his invisible Deity, nor to
the lineamentes or parts of his members, for this is of a round proportion and
insensible touching the power theirof, and his meaning was to say trough grace,
this is mine, this and this, and every man belieueth this speech, for he that
belieueth it not to be himself indeed, is fallen from grace and salvation.

S. Gaudentius anno 390. says: tract. 2. de exodo
the creator himself and Lord of all creatures and natures, who produces bread
from the earth, does from the earth again, because he both can and has
promised it, make his own body, and he that has made wine of water, has also
made his blood of wine: Et pauso post; believe that which has bine taught,
that, that which thou receauest is the body of that heavenly bread, and the
blood of that sacred vine, for when he delivered the consecrated bread and wine
to his disciples, he said: This is my body, this is my blood. Let us beliue
him, whom we have believed, truth cannot lie.

S. Chrysostom anno 380. says: hom. 60. ad Populum Antiochenu^ and hom. 83.
in mat^hcum.
Let us yield unto God not resisting, although that which he speaks seem
absurd to our sense and reason. Let his word, I beseech you, conquear our
sense and reason in all things, but especially in mysteries, not beholding
only those things, which are before us, but believing also his words; for we
cannot be deceived by his word, although our sense be very easy to be
deceived, therefore because he has said; This is my body, let us not doubt of
it, but believe it. Et ibid. how many be there that say, I would gladly see
his shape and proportion, I would gladly see his apparel, I would gladly see
his shoos; therefore thou see him, thou touchest him, thou eatest him etc.

Again. homil. 3 in epist. 3. ad Ephesians.
We speak concerning his body, as being that which differs nothing from it
how many of us be made partakers of his body? how many of us do taste his
blood? consider that there is the body and blood which is resident above in the
heavens, which is humbly adored by the Angels.

Again. lib de Sacerdono.

[The works that are set before us are not of humane virtue, we are in place

infra: he that has said this is my body has confirmed his fact by his word.]

Again homil. de Eucharistia in Enc^niis.
[doest thou see the bread? do thou see the wine? does it pass into the
draught as other meats? God forbid, think not so, for if wax being applied to
the fire is made like unto it, and none of the substance thereof does remain
nothing is over plus, so also here thou must think that the mysteries are
consumed by the substance of the body.]

S. Hierome anno 380. says: in Comme^t. Matthew. ^^p. 26.
[after that the typical pasche was fullfild, and he had eaten the flesh of
the lamb with his Apostles, he took bread which comfort the heart of man,
and so proceeds unto the true Sacrament of the pasche: that even as in his
prefiguration Melchisedech the priest of the high God had done offering up
bread and wine, he also might represent the truth of his body and blood*]

Again: epist. ad Hedibiam. quaest. 2.
[let us say (says he) that the bread which our Lord brake and gave to his
disciples, is the body of our Lord and Savior. Et infra: neither did Moses
give us the true bread, but our Lord Jesus, he is the guest, and the banquet,
he does eat, and is eaten.]

S. Austine anno 400. says: epist. 86. ad Cosulatium.
[Hee says the beast has given place to the bread* as it were unwittingly,
and that then the bread of proposition was wount to be put upon the table of
our Lord, but now that he did take part of the body of the immaculate la^be,
he says that the blood gave place to the cup, not thinking that he did now
also receive blood in the cup. Et infra: therefore he said it was so much the
better and more requisite or convenient to have the old pass away, and the new
ordained in Christ, that the altar might give place to the altar, the sword
to the sword, the fire to the fire, the bread to the bread, the lamb to the
lamb, and blood to blood]

Again, lib. 12. co^tra Faustum cap 10 and cap. 20.

[Wee receive (says he) with a faithful heart and mouth the mediator

Again: lib. 2. co^tra Pe^il. cap. 17.
[The Pasche which they do as yet celebrate of the sheep is one thing: and

Again explicating the title of the psalm whearin it is written: And he was
carried in his own hands, he says: in psalmu^ 33. conc. ^.
[who can understand how this may be done in a man? for who is carried in his
own hands? a man may be carried in other men's, hands, but no man is carried
in his own hands, we do not find how it should be understood to be in David
himself, but we find it in Christ, for Christ was carried in his own hands,
when giving his own body he said: This is my body, for he did carry that body
in his own hands.]

Finally he says: Sermon. ad Neophytos. vt ^estatur Iuo C^^notensis Epis^. in
epist ad Hay^^^^mu^ and Paschasius in epist. ad Frudrg^^ iii.
[take ye this in the Chalice, which issued from the side of Christ.] And
again: we are invited to a table, where is not found the meat of men, but the
bread of Angels is prepared.

S. Cyrill of Alexandr. anno 430. explicating that of the gospel: How can
this man give us his flesh to eat, he says: S. Cyrill lib 4. in (...). cap. 3.

once pronounce that (How).

Again: in epistola ad C^^^sy^^um.
[wee would not (says he) abhor flesh and blood, prepared upon the holy
aulters if we did consider that God yelding and condescending to our
fragilitie and weakness did infuse the virtue of life into the things offered,
turning them into the verity of his own flesh, that a body of life may be
found in us, as a certain seed.

S. Theodoret anno 440. says* in primo Dialogo.
our Savior changed the names, and gave that name to the body which was
proper to the token and sign, to the sign or token which was of his body:
(And adds) for he would have them which are partakere of mysteries, not to
attend or respect the nature of those things that are seen, but to believe
the chance, which is done by grace, for the only mutation of names.

S. Leo Pope anno 450. says: Sermo. 14. de passione Domini
we taste him in all respects, both in spirit and flesh.

Again: Sermo 6. de ieiunio septimi mentis.
you ought so to communicate of the holy table as to doubt nothing at all of
the verity of the body and blood of Christ, for that is received by the mouth,
which is believed in heart, and in vain do they say Amen, that dispute against
that which is received.

S. Eusebius Emissenus anno 520. says* Sermo. de corpore Domini.
when the creatures are put upon the holy aulters to be blessed with heavenly
words, before that they be consecrated by the invocation of the^ highest
power, there is the substance of bread and wine, but after the words of
Christ there is the body and blood of Christ* And what maruaill is it if he
chaung those things which he created by his word?

S. Remigius anno 480. says: in comm. in 1. Cor. cap. 10.
upon those words of S. Paul* The bread which we break is it not the
participation of the body of our Lord? even then (says he) as soon as it is
the consecrated and blessed by the priests and the holy ghost, and afterward
broken, when now it is indeed the true body of Christ, although it seem bread:
Et infra: The flesh (says he) which the word of God the Father did assume in
the virgin womb, in the unity of his person, and the bread, which is
consecrated in the church, are one body, for as that flesh is the body of
Christ, neither are they twoe bodies, but one body.

S. Gregory Pope anno 590. having done a miracle before the people he said:
testo Paulo Diacono in eius vita.
learn to believe the truth even now testifying it self, the bread which I
will give is my fllesh, and my blood is truly drink. But the all knowing
creator of our infirmity, by the same power where with he made althinges of
nothing, and the operation of the holy ghost he made himself a body of the
flesh of one always a virgin, and for our reparation or redemption by a
Catholic prayer and sanctification of his holy spirit he turned bread and wine
mixed with water, their proper species still remaining into his flesh and blood.]

Again: Idem 22. in Euangelia.
[you have now learned (says he) not by hearing but by drinking, what is the
blood of the lamb, which blood is put upon both sides of the door, when it is
dronken not only with the mouth of our body, but also with the mouth of the
heart.]

M. Witaker says that Pope Nicholas the second was the first that tought
Christ's body to be sensibly handled, broken and eaten with teeth which
objection being (I suppose) sufficiently answered already by that which has
bine said, our Lutheran Adversaries not withstanding shall yet more directly
answer to it, who have defended it against their other brethren our
Adversaries.

Concerning the phrase which is but a verbal objection Collat. Cathol. and
Orthodox. Christianorum fidei page 326.
Jacob Andreas in the Protestant treatise entitled as in the margent says:
[in regard of the species or form of the dove aff^^med, that which is proper
to the dove is attributed to the holy ghost, and it seems to repugne the
nature of the holy ghost; even as ecclesiastical writers, because of the
presence of Christ's body in the Supper, have said that Christ's body is
handled, broken with teeth, and such like, which are not proper to the body of
Christ, but attributed to it in respect of the bread.

Also the same Andreas says: in confut. disput. Joan. Iacobi Grino^ page 214.
[It is plainly explicated how the body of Christ is said to be broken with
teeth, seen and touched in this Sacrament, which are phrases not newly
invented and brought into the Church by Luther, but are learned, pious and of
Orthodoxall antiquity etc.

Again he says: and page 215.
[This recantation prescribed unto Berengarius by Pope Nicolas and the Synod
contemeth nothing which is not contained in the wrykinges of Orthodoxall
Fathers especially of Chrysostom, who says: Homil 83. in Matthew. post medium
Thou see him, thou touchest him, thou eatest him etc. And in an other place
of the some Chrysostom: and hom. 45. in Joan. post medium
he does not only permit himself to be seen of such as desire him, but also
touched, eaten, and his flesh broken with teeth.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says. Sermo de Eucharistia.
[That in the Sacrament of the Altar there is not bread and wine, but the
form of bread and wine, to wit: the bread is changed into the true and
natural body of Christ, and the wine into the true and natural blood of
Christ.] Also: [euen as that bread is truly chanced into his true and natural
body and the wine into his natural blood, so are we drawn and changed into
his spiritual body, that is; into the communion of Christ and all Saints:
some relying upon their own knowledge and subtlety, do ask where the bread
is when it is changed into the flesh of Christ and the wine when it is
changed into the blood of Christ: [This he says thou ought to believe
although thou see it not.

And speaking of the Adoration of the Sacrament he says: Ibidem fol. 370.
he that does not believe the body and blood of Christ is there does well if he
do not adore it neither spiritually nor Carnally, but he which does believe,
(as is sufficiently demons^rated that he ought) this man cannot truly with out
sin restrain his reverence from the body and blood of Christ. For certainly I
am forced to confess that Christ is their present, when his body and blood are
present.]

Epistola ad Argemmen^es.
But in an other place he says that he could willingly and with all his heart
deny the body of Christ to be in the Eucharist, if the Scriptures were not so
clear against him, for by that means (says he) I could much dommage. the
whole Roman Church. yet that he might at least in some thing swarne from the
ancient received Catholic opinion, he affirmed that the body of Christ was
with the bread and wine and not the bread and wine it self changed into his
body and blood.

Again: he says. lib cont. R^gem Angli^^.
[That he is impious and blasphemous that does say the bread is
transubstantiate. Adu. Theolog^^ louan, art 22.
And that the Doctors of Louaine do teach the tra^substantiation of the bread
and wine in the Sacrament with out any ground or word of scripture, but only
out of ignorance. yet in the same place he does in the mean time affirm the
verity of Christ's body saying: the body and blood of Christ is indeed showed
in the venerable Sacrament of the Eucharist, and truly received, as well of the
worthy as the unworthy in Visitatione Saxonica.
But says he; the faithful of Christ are to be, taught that the true blood of
Christ is in the wine. [Which opinion remained ever afterward with all his
posterity.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin does of purpose propound his opinion very obscurely, that there may
seem to be contemed some mystery. First therefore he teaches, that the signs
of the supper are only here on earth: and the body of Christ, only in heaven:
in sine consensus cum pastoribus Tigurimis.
wherefore he affirms that there is as great a space between the body of
Christ and the bread and wine in the Supper, as there is between the earth and
the highest heavens. to wit: that the body of Christ is no where, but in that
one certain and determinate pleace of heaven. The same also says de re
Sacramentaria q. 6
Beza in express words in the some of his doctrine.

Secundly Calvin teaches, that the signs and body of Christ, although in
place they differ very much, yet they are so conjoined to gether, not only
touching the sign, in that one is a token of the other, but also because,
together with the sign, God does truly give us the very body and blood of
Christ, whereby our souls are indeed nourished unto life everlasting. This
Calvin has in all the places above noted; And also says yet further: upon the
26. Matthew.
That in the supper, the body of Christ is truly given us, that it may be a
wholesome food unto our souls, that is; our souls are fed with the substance
of Christ's body, that we may truly become one with him. And a little after:
therefore (says he) an empty and bare sign is not set before us, but such as
receive this promise by faith are truly made partakers of the body and blood of
our lord.

Again: he teaches that to eat the flesh of Christ, is not only to believe,
but also to be made truly partaker of his flesh; lib. 4. inst. cap. 17.. 5.
[For (says he) as not the beholding, but eating of bread is required unto the
nourishment of our body: so it is necessary that our soul be truly and fully
made partaker of Christ. Again:. 32.
in the holy supper he commands me under the signs or forms of bread and
wine, to receive his body and blood: I nothing doubt but he does truly give it,
and I truly receive it these Calvin.

But because this secund seems contrary to the first (for how can the body
of Christ be truly given to us with the bread, and be present in the supper, if
this body be only in the highest heaven, and the bread only on earth?) therefore
he adds this third saying Ibib.. 7.
there remains nothing (says he) but that I break out into admiration of
that mys^erie, which certainly neither mind by thinking, nor tongue by
explicating is sufficient to express; And again.. 10.
But although it seem incredible, that in so great v distance of place, the
flesh of Christ should so penetrate, as to be meat for us; let us remember how
far the secret virtue of the holy ghost does exceed our understanding, and
how foolish a thing it is to measure his immensitie, or wonderfullnes by our
capacity, therefore what our understanding does not comprehend, let faith
conceive, that the spirit does truly unite, what is disioyned by distance of
place.

Again:. 32.
Moreover (says he) if any ask of me the manner how, he shall not be ashamed
to confess that it is a secret more high, then either by wit can be
comprehended, or words declared. The like has Beza, de Sacramentis q 9.
But (says he) nevertheless we confess that the mystery of God is
incomprehensible, whereby it comes to pass that the same which is and remaneth
in heaven, and no other where, is truly communitated unto us, who are now on
earth and no other where.

But because Calvin perceived this his mystery to be incredible, and to
inuolue a most manifest contradiction he adds that the very body of Christ
did not descend, but a certain substantial force derived unto us from the flesh
of Christ by his spirit, as a certain Channel or conduit, for thus he
speaks. lib. 4. instit. cap. 17.. 12.
[The bond (says he) of that conjunction is the spirit of Christ by whose
fastining we are coupled together and as a certain conduit, by which what
soever Christ himself both is, and has is derived unto us. Again I freely
confess, that I reject the mixture of Christ's flesh with our soul, or
transfusion, as they teach; because it suffices us that Christ does from the
substance of flesh, breath life into our souls, yea power out his own life
into us, although his very flesh do not enter into us.]

Again:. 13.
[Wee must (says he) frame such a presence of Christ in the supper, as may
neither adioyne him to the element, of bread, nor include him in the bread, or
any ways enclose him etc. least something should be affixed to his body nor
agreeable to man's nature, which is done, when it is said to be infinite or in
many places at once. Also: certainly that which we teach has nothing in it
whereby to give offense to any, unless to a few ages, when that ignorance of
Sophisters did reign in the Church, and the clear light and manifest truth
was oppressed with barbarism.

Again: 15. 29.
[Let this therefore be establissed for certain, that the flesh of Christ is not
truly given unto us in the supper for food, unless the true substance of the
external sign did signify as much. But as one error rises out of an other;
that place of Hieremia is so foolishly wrested to prove transubstantiation;
that a man May be ashamed to relate it etc. yet so also thought many of the
Fathers; but what? as if their ignorance were not rather to be pardoned, and
sh^me concealed, then impudency to be added, whereby to fear them yet still in
hostile manner to contend with the true sense of the Prophet. These Calvin.

An old condemned Heresy by the primitive Church.
This was in time past the heresy of the Sacramentaries, Synodo. 7. act. 6.
tom. 3. S. Theodoret Dialog qui dicetur impatibilis.
that the Eucharist (or lords supper) was not the true flesh of Christ, but
only a figure and image of the body of Christ. The same many ages before
reports S. Theodoretus out of S. Ignatius disciple to S. John.

Moreover there were others, who not denying the verity of Christ's body in
the Eucharist denied not withstand that the body of Christ did remain in the
Eucharist if it were kept until the next day, whom S. Cyrill therefore says
that they were madd. S. Cyrill in epistola ad Calosyrium Episcopum.


Whereas it is objected that the sixth chapter of S. John does not treat of the
Eucharist. I prove the contrary very manifestly that it does specially treat
of it. The question therefore is not whether the whole chapter perteine unto
this matter, for the contrary is manifest, as in a great part thereof mention
is made of the miracle of bread, faithl, and incarnation. the controversy
therefore is only of these words: The bread which I will give is my flesh for
the life of the world etc. almost to the end.

Almost all the heretics of these times deny these words to perteine to the
Sacrament of the Eucharist. Luth l de capt. Babyl. cap. 1.
Luther says that all the sixth chapter of Saints John ought to be laid aside,
as nothing pertegning to this matter, the same says, Zuing lib de vera salsa
religione cap. de Each.
Zuinglius, Occ. lib de verbis Dom. hoc est etc.
Oecolampadius, Rem. 2. part examinis page ^^^ ad cap 1. ^^ss. ^1. Council.
T^^dem.
Kemnitius, etc.

But now all Catholics, except some few of this age, did ever understand the
words of this chapter to be meant of the very Sacrament of the Eucharist, or
Sacramental eating of the body of our lord in the Eucharist. Some Catholics
indeed that they might more easily answer the Hussites, or Lutherans proving
out of this chapter communion under both kind^^, did teach the contrary. as
Gabriel, Ocsanus, Ca^^^n, ^apper, Hisselius, and Iansemus. But these did ever
subject themselves and their opinions to the censure of the whole Church and
Pops of Rome, which h^retickes do not, but defend every man his pharisie.

The Catholic opinion, that this chapter does treat of the Sacramental
eating of Christ's body in the Eucharist, may be proved by these sower
arguments; first out of this very place of Scripture it self, Secundly by the
testimony of the Church, thirdly by the Fathers, Fourthby by the absurdities
which otherwise would follow.

Concerning the first out of the text (to omit many more) these three may
suffice.

First therefore our lord speaks of a thing to be, or that shable, when the
says:. 51.
the bread which I will give, is my flesh for the life of the world. But if the
bread in this place should signify Christ, as he is received by says, he
should not speak of a thing, to be, for that kind of eating by faith, has
bine a thing common in all ages, and the Fathers of the old testament did eat.
Christ in that manner.

The secund argument may be made by comparing these words with the words of
the supper: for so great is the similitude, that the holy Scripture seems
manifestly to crave that to be restored, which has bine here promised: for
here it is said: The bread which I will give is my flesh for the life of the
world. But there: Matthew. 26.26.
Take ye and eat, for this is my body, Luc 22.19.
which is given for you unto remission of sins.

The third argument may be taken out of the words following: to wit: Therefore
the Jews did strive among themselves saying: how can this man give us his
flesh to eat? And out of those of his disciples a little after saying: This is
a hard speech and who can hear him? For out of these we may collect, that as
well the Jews as his disciples themselves, did understand some new and
wonderful thing propounded by Christ. Yet our lord did not therefore correct
them, but did again inculcate and urge the same saying: Unless you shall eat
the flesh of there son of man, and drink his blood you shall not have life
in you.

Secondly it is proved out of the testimony of the Church: for the in epistola
ad Nestorium.
Council of Alexandrie, approved in the third general Synod expounds that:
Unless you shall eat, etc. to be spoken of the receiving of this Sacrament.
the same does the Sub finem tertij tomi. Sess. 13. cap. 2.
seventh Synod and likewise the Council of Trent expounds the words: He
which eats me shall live for me, to be also of this Sacrament now although
these Counsels made no decree of this matter: yet it is sufficiently evident,
what all the Bishops of these three general Counsels did think, and
consequently the whole Church, which they did represent.

Thirdly it is proved out of the Fathers, that have written commentaries upon
S. John, and with one general consent expound these places of the Sacrament of
the Eucharist. as S. Chrysostom, Augustine, Cyrill, Theophylactus, Euthymius,
Rupertus. S. Thomas, Nicholas, Hyramus, and Dionysius, the Carthusian, besides
infinite others who for their purpose and as occasion did offerre it self in
expounding this gospel, as Origin, Athanasius, Basil, etc.

Fourthly this verity is proved out of the absurdities which would follow.
First therefore it would follow that S. John should have written nothing of this
Sacramt, for he touches this matter no where, unless in this place. But
certainly it were most absurd, that the chief evangelist, and most diligent in
explic^ting the most secret mysteries should leave nothin^ in writing
concerning this great Sacrament, especially when he has written so much of
baptism, wherefore lib 3 de consensu Euang cap 1.
S. Augustine affirms that S. John [hath written nothing of the supper of our
lord in his proper place, as the rest did, because he had written at large of
it before. Secondly it would follow that Christ did never explicate the fruit,
and excellency of this Sacrament, which he has done very often of Baptism
for in the last supper he only instituted it S. Chrysostom observes as much
in his commentary upon the 26. of S. Matt.
but added nothing concerning the explication thereof which also is confirmed.
Because the Apostles without doubt would have been moved and troubled when
they heard: Take ye and eat for this is my body, if they had not been
instructed before. Thirdly it would follow that there should be no divine
precept for the receiving of this Sacrament. For the other Evangelists mention
only the institution, and that as often as it is taken it be done in
remembrance of our Saviors passion.

Solutions to the Adversaries objections against the real presence proved out
of this sixth Chapter of S. John.
The first argument is Luthers, which also Kemnitius with others, always uses
which is this: the supper of our lord was instituted the day before his
passion. but that speech written in the sixth of S. John, was a whole year
before the passion of our Savior; therefore it does not treat of the supper which
Kemnitius confirms For (says he) if therefore the Papists w^ll reform the
communion, because in S. John it is said: cap. 6.
He which shall eat of this bread shall live forever. it shall be also
necessary to say, that water only is to be used in the supper. because it is
also said: He that shall drink of this water, cap. ^^
shall not thirst forever.

I answer: we do not deny but the supper of our lord was instituted the day
before his passion; and not a year before: but we say that a whole year
before it was promised by Christ, and disputed of by him concerning the
excellent fruits of that Supper which was to be. And this also our Savior did
in many other things. For in cap. 16.
S. Matthew he promised to S. Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and
explicated what force they should have which not withstanding he did not
deliver, John (...)
until after his resurrection.

To the confirmation I answer: Catholics do not reform the communion
delivered in S. Matt. by that of S. John, as Kemmtius fayneth, for the
communion in S. Matt. is not deformed, that it should need any reformation, yet
we say that one place may be truly explicated by an other: and because it is
said in S. John: He which eats this bread shall live forever. We unfeignedly
collect, that the Sacrament taken under one kind does so suffice; that two
forms or species are not necessarily required to receive the fruit of this
Sacrament or communion. but there is great dissimilitude between the water
whereof our Savior speaks in the fourth of S. John, and the bread in the
sixth. For all interpreters expound the latter place to be understood of the
Eucharist, as is already shexed; but no man at any time has ever taken the
latter in that sense. Moreover S. John himself explicateth that by water is
understood the grace of the holy ghost, for in his seventh chapter he says:
But this he spoke of the Spirit which they should receive believing in him. But
the bread in the sixth chapter our Savior himself said, it was his flesh, when
he says: The bread which I will give is my flesh.

The second argument also is Luthers: in this manner: In the sixth of S. John
our Savior disputed of that eating of heavenly bread, which gives life, but
only that spiritual eating by faith gives life, therefore that chapter
treats only of that spiritual eating.

I answer; the assumptum is false: for Sacramental eating also does give
life: as in Baptism not only the internal washing but also the external,
does cleance souls the first formally, the other effecting as by the
instrument, and as it is written: Act. 15.
purifying their hearts by faith: so it is also said, Ephesians. 3.
cleansing it by the lauer of water in the word of ife. Neither does it hinder,
that the Sacramental eating does not give life without faith: For that
proceeds from the unprepared disposition of the receauer, and not from the
Sacrament it self. which of it self is always powerful and sufficient.

part 1 ad obiectum 1^. page 94.
The third argument also is from Luther and Peter Martyr in his defense against
Gardine, after this manner: our Savior in that chapter does not only say, that
the eating of this bread does give life, but also that with out this eating no
man can live: Unless ye shall eat etc. But this straight precept cannot be
understood of a Sacramental eating: for so all infants should perish, which
can eat nothing but only suck milk: yea all that cannot communicate being
hindered by some lawful and necessary cause should likwyse perish, although
otherwise baptized and justified.

I answer it is a common difficulty how soever this place be understood. for
if the Adversaries will have it understood of a spiritual eating by faith;
how, I pray you, shall infants eat it who neither have any use of the spirit or
actual faith? yea it wear more easy to instill some little part of the
Sacrament into infantes, then to make them to believe, therefore I say this
place does perteyne only to the aged. Finally either these words: Unless ye
shall eat etc. Do signify a precept, or a mean necessary unto salu^tion: if a
precept, either it does not perteyne unto infants, because they are not capable
of it or certainly they are excused because they cannot fulfill it for this is
common to every precept, if a meanl necessary unto salvation, certainly it is
only for such as can loose their life, which infants cannot because they want,
the use of reason.

The fourth argument is likewise Luthers: where he alleges that lib 2 contra
Julian.
S. Austine teaches that infants do eat the flesh of Christ, in that they
communicate by faith: therefore this place is understood of eating by faith. to
this may be added other places of the Fathers producued by tract. 25.
Peter Martyr and others, for S. Augustine expounds the sixth of S. John so
spiritually that he says: believe and thou have eaten. And in an other place:
To believe in him, Ibidem tract. 26.
is to eat the lively bread. and in an other place he says that these words:
Unless ye shall eat the flesh of the son of man, do signify no other thing,
but that we ought to communicate, and cogitate earnesly in our mind the
passion of our lord, and his flesh crucified for us. Also lib. 1. Pedagogi cap.
6.
clement of Alexandria expounds that in this place; by the flesh and blood of
Christ is understood the word of God, whereby we are spiritually fed and
nourished. Also Epist. 141.
S. Basil interprets by the flesh and blood, the doctrine of Christ and his
mystical coming. in Psalm. 147
S. Hierome likewise by the flesh and blood of our lord understands the
Scriptures. lastly in verse. 3. Psalm. 90.
S. Bernard says. That to eat the flesh of Christ, is to communicate the
passion of our lord and to imitate his life.

I answer: to the place of S. Augustine brought by Luther which is the first
book against Julian, and not in the secund as he cites first we must observe
that S. Austine does often times say, lib. 3. de peccator meritis and remiss.
c. 4 and in Sermon. ad infantes queritat Beda in comment. 1. Cor. 10.
that infants ought to eat the body of our lord, if they will be saved, but he
does not understand it to be necessarily done indeed for the same S. Augustine
in the same place says: that infants in the very Baptism, do participate of
the body of Christ, and that by the receiving of Baptism, they do also
fulfill the precept of receiving the Eucharist.

Secondly we must note, that infants are not only not bound to the communion
indeed, but neither by external desire, whereof they are by no means capable,
but only by an inward desire which they have, when they are baptized: for then
they receive power to participate of the Bucharist, and because every one that
is borne does naturally desire meat: therefore also they in that they are borne
again in Christ, do crave the meat or food of the regenerate yet so, as to be
received in it time and place: therefore infants do neither communicate
spiritually not Sacramentally concerning the thing, but Sacramentally by an
inward desire, whereupon it follows that it is not altogether the same for
them to be baptized and to communicate, although they are done together,
because the one proceeds from the other. Therefore S. Austine although in the
places cited say, that infantes do eat the flesh of Christ in baptism, not
withstanding in an other place he does manifestly distinguish* to be baptized
and to eat the flesh of Christ. Sermo de ^erbis Domini.
For (says he) it is one thing to be borne of the spirit, and an other to
feed of the spirit, as it is one thing to be borne of the flesh, which is done
when the mother brings forth; and an other to feed of the flesh which is done
when the infant sucheth. lib 1 de peccator me^^^ and remiss. c. ^0.
And in an other place he plainly demonstrateth that this precept; Unless ye
eat, is distinguished from the precept of Baptism, yea in infantes:

I answer therefore to the argument, that S. Austine does expound this place to
be understood of a Sacramental eating, but yet that he does attribut that
eating to infants, not in the thing, but in an inward desire, which is had by
baptism as we have said.

To the other two places of S. Augustine I answer, that, that saying: To what
end do thou prepare thy teeth and belly? believe and thou have eaten; And
that: To believe in him is to eat his flesh, are spoken by him not of the
Sacrament, but of the belief of the incarnation for yet he had not com to that
part of the gospel which treats of the last supper but that saying: who
eats in heart not who presses with his teeth, S. Augustine said when he
spoke of the Sacrament, not to exclude Sacramental eating, but that he might
signify the end of the Sacrament to be this to nourish our soul and not our
body for he is truly refreshed with this meat that eats in heart, not that
presses it with his teeth, to wit: only with his teeth: for he does not
exclude corporal eating, when in the same place he says that Judas did eat it
only corporally: but only he does prefer the spiritual eating before the
corporal, because the spiritual does profitt without the carnal, but not the
corporal with out the spiritual: The like is that place of Osea: I will
mercy not Sacrifice: Osea cap. 6.
Now our lord does not reject sacrifices, but will none of them without mercy.

To the other Fathers I answer, that they expound mystically, not according to
the letter: but they in no place ever denied, that those words ought not to be
taken literally of the Sacramental eating, yea on the contrary, they are above
cited in be half of the Sacramental eating, for the literal and mystical
sense do not repugne one an other.

To the last of S. Austine I answer; Lib. ^. de Doctrina Christiana.
he puteth a figure in the words concerning the manner of receiving the flesh
of Christ, not of the substance of the thing it self. For he would not say, the
flesh of Christ so called figuratively is to be eaten, that is, the bread
whereby his flesh is signified; if we consider the essence and very thing of
eating, which only requires that true meat be delivered through the mouth unto
the stomach by vital instruments, we shall easily perceive that S. Austine
understands it to be eatcn figuratively concerning the manner: for the
ordinary and proper manner of eating flesh is, that it be visibly cut in
parts, and so taken by little and little, boiled, not raw etc. but the flesh
of Christ is taken whole and inuisibly without any hurt of it self, wherefore the
flesh of Christ is slain, and torn in eating not properly but only
figuratively: for we represent the passion of Christ.

Now that S. Austine does understand it in this sense, this manifest for tow
respects, first because he says it is to be expounded figuratively least some
unlawful act or wickedness should seem to be commanded.

Moreover it were a wicked thing to kill and eat the flesh of Christ in parts:
but not after a certain spiritual manner to receive the very flesh it self in
the Sacrament without any hurt there unto. Secondly because he himself does
explicate what is the litterall sense, which seems to sound any wickedness, to
wit, that wherein the Capharnaites did take the words of Christ, tract. 27.
in Ioann. and Psalm 98.
who thought that his flesh was to be torn, as we see it done in the shambles
and some little part given to every one therefore when S. Austine says that by
this precept. (Unless ye eat) is commanded that we communicate by the
passion of Christ, and worship and cogitat it in our minds: he does only
signify that which the Apostle says: 1. Cor. 11.
That the flesh of Christ is to be received in the Sacrament for a remembrance
of the passion and death of our lord.

All other friuoulous objections, for as much as they have no authority but
their own bare explications, I think needless to write, specially when you
see that we have all antiquity with the whole Church for our sentence and
opinion, to wit, that the true body and blood of Christ is undoubtedly and
really eaten in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

But to make S. Austine more clear, hear yet this one sentence of his. he
therefore expounding a little beneath, ^.
these words. He which eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me,
says thus. [He that remains not in Christ and in whom Christ does not
remain, without doubt he does not eat his flesh spiritually, nor drink his
blood; although carnally and visibly he press the body and blood of Christ
with his teeth: but does rather eat ad drink the Sacrament of so great a
thing to his own judgment: because being unclean he does presume to come to
the Sacrament of Christ, which no man receaueth worthily unless he be clean.
These S. Austine. who therefore ca^ be so froward, as to deny and say that S.
Austine does not expound these words of S. John, to pertain unto the Sacrament
of the Eucharist, where the flesh and blood of Christ is realy eaten and
dronken; and that he would only teach when he says: This bread is to be eaten
by faith; that neither teeth nor belly is to be prepared, but that faith and
purity of mind is necessary, whereby this meat ought to be taken, that it may
profit and be worthily eaten, without which it does not profit but hurt.

Again; our adversaries object an other place out of S. Athanasius, where in
his tract upon these words: Whoesoeuer shall speak a word against the son of
man, it shall be for given etc. says thus: How many men would his body have
sufficed for meat that it might become food for the whole world? but therefore
he made mention of his ascension into heaven, that he might draw them from a
corporal understanding, and that they afterward might understand his flesh
(whereof he spoke) to be meat sent from heaven, and spiritual food, and that it
was to be given by himself. For the words which I speak unto you (our
Savior) are spirit and life: which is the same as if he should say; my body
which is shevven and given for the world, shall be given for meat, that it may be
given spirituallie to every one, and become a protection and preservation to
every one, unto the resurrection of life everlasting. These S Athanasius.

Peter Martyr does so triumph upon this place that he says, lib. contra
Gardener. object. 1^0.
he does think there is scarre any stronger argument then this, or more
invincible amongst those that are taken out of the Fathers.

I answer: the force of this argument consists in there points, so first in
that he says; the eating of our Lords body ought not to be taken carnally,
because his flesh would not suffice so many, as should eat of it, if it were
taken carnally, but this does not make against our sentence, but the
Capharnaites, who thought that the flesh of Christ ought to be divided into
little parts, and so distributed to every one that should eat of it, and in
this manner indeed it would not suffice so many without some miracle, but we
say that the flesh of Christ is so to be taken that it be all received
indiuisibly of every one, moreover in that S. Athanasius says; that the flesh
of Christ is spiritual food, and to be distributed spiritually it does not any
way offend our opinion: for the flesh of Christ is most truly called spiritual
food, because it is given for the me^t of the spirit, and not of the body, and
is distributed spiritually, not corporally, because it is not divided into
parts, but is given all whole together as we have said) indiuisibly, Sermo,
de S. Martino.
where upon S. Bernard says* That the flesh of Christ is given and eaten
spiritually, and yet in the same place he says: That the true substance of the
flesh is present in the Sacrament.

in Actis eiusdem concil^^^ v^tic^na Bibliotheca.
But to make ^. Athanasius yet more plain receive this one sentence of the
council of Nice, whereof himself was one of the chief the words are these;
Also here, upon the divine table, let us not simply attend or respect the
bread and cup set before us, but lifting up our mynds and understanding by
says; let us acknowledge to be placed upon that sacred table, that lamb of God
which takes away the sins of the world, being offered up vnbloodily by the
priests, and truly taking his body and blood let us believe them to be the
tokens of our resurrection: for by this neither do we receive much but little
that we may know it is taken not unto fullnes, but sanctification.

This testimony also our adversaries for the most part do acknowledge, which
together whith that which has bine said, I think sufficent to explicate a real
receiving of the true body and blood of our Savior according to his own
words; but for your better satisfaction, and more full refutation of your
error, especially in this point, as also that you may see how all ages, as
well before our Saviors coming, as since, and all the learned of Gods church
both Jew and Christian, have ever written against you heerin, I have collected
the sayings of some chief Jews before our Saviors time, who then were the
true church of God, and interpreters of his word.

A Brief demonstration from the ancient Jews for the real presence.
Rabby Cahana says: a^ cap. 4 G^^^s. v. 11.
That the sacrifice which shall be offered of wine, shall not only be changed
into the substance of the blood of the messiah, but (...) into the substance of
his body; the sacrifice which shall be of bread, notwithstanding that it be white
is milk, it shall be converted into the substance of the messiah.

Rabby Judas says. in 25. Exodus
The bread shall be changed when it shall be sacrificed, from the substance of
bread, into the substance of the body of the messiah, which shall descend from
heaven, and he himself shall be the sacrifice.

Rabby Simeon the son of Iohas says: lib qui in (...): Reuelatio Secretor^m.
The sacrifice which priests shall make, after the messiah has come etc. they
shall make it of bread and wine etc. and that sacrifice which shall be so
celebrated upon every altar, shall be turned into the body of the messiah.

Rabby Barachias says: that food, in Ecclesiast.
at the coming of the messiah shall come from heaven like to a little Cake.

Rabby Moses Hadarsan says: in psalmum 1 ^.
Taste ye and behold ye for God is good, and the very bread which he gives
to all is his flesh, and whilst the bread is tasted it is turned into his flesh
etc.

See these aforesaid testimonies and sundry others like alleged from the
Rabbynes by Perrus Galatinus. de Ar^ (...) 10 cap ^. 6 7 (...) sect. 3 (...) v^

protestants Apology for the Roman church.

THE 33. ARTICLE. Of the Sacrifice of the Mass.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
Christians have in the church one only Sacrifice of the new testament, wherein
the unspotted Lamb, of God, Christ, is offered a Satisfaction for our sins,
whereof the Prophet Daniel and God himself speaks in Malacthie; and of which
the Lamb of the Jews and all other Sacrifices were types and figures.

When the continual sacrifice shall be taken away; to wit, in the days of
Antichrist who (as most Fathers expound it) shall reign three years and a
half.

And as they were ministering to our Lord and fasting, the holy ghost said.

of the body of our Lord?

which priests also do now make, this oblation has nothing less then that

before; for as the words which Christ spoke be the same that the priest does
now pronounce, so the oblation is also the same.

they exspect another Christ.

S Eusebius anno 330. Cesariensis: Therefore we sacrifice unto almighty God a
sacrifice of praise, we sacrifice unto God a full sacrifice, which carries a
sweet smelling odor, and most holy sacrifice; we sacrifice a pure sacrifice
after a new manner according to the new testament.

S. Gregory 1. Pope: lib. 4. Dialog. cap 58.
anno 1600. says. This victime or sacrifice does marueilouslie deliver a soul
from eternal destruction, and does also renew unto us in a mystery that death
of the only begotten, who although rising again from the dead he do not now
dye, and death shall no more triumph over him, yet liueing in himself
immortallie and vncorruptiblie, is sacrificed again for us in this mystery of
the holy sacrifice, for his body is received there, his flesh is given for the
salvation of the people, his blood is now powered out, not into the hands of
the unfaithful, but into the mou^hes of the faithful, hence therefore let us
consider what a manner of sacrifice this is for us. which at the voice of a
priest does open the heavens for our absolution, in that mysteries of Christ
the companies of Angels are present, the lowest things are joined in
fellowship with the highest, earthly things with heavenly, and of visible and
invisible one thing is made.

entitled. The relics of Rome. fol. 44.
M. Beacon (whom the ministers of lincolnshire in their abridgment etc.
affirm to be a deuyne of chief note in their church) says seriously: The
mass was begotten, conceived, and borne anon after the Apostles times, if all
be true, that Historiographers write.

Hospinianus says: even in that first age they yet liueing, the Devil did
attempt to lay his snares rather against this Sacrament, then Baptism, and by
little and little did seduce men from that first form.

m Sebastianus Flaucus says most plainly, That presently after the Apostles,
all things were turned vpside down etc. the supper of the Lord was changed
into a sacrifice.

M. Ascham (a prime protestant) does acknowledge without more ado, that no
beginning thereof after the Apostles time can be showed, saying; At what time,
and by whom the supper of the Lord was thrust from its possession by the
mass, cannot certainly be known.

Calvin says that Athanasius, Ambrose, Austine, Arnobius etc. erred heerin so
far, that they forged a sacrifice in the Lords supper, without our Saviors
command, and so adulterated or corrupted the supper, with adding of
(Sacrifice.)

Again, he says: lib. de ver^ Ecclesiae reformation^ page 389.
The ancient Fathers cannot be excused, for as much as it is manifest they have
declined from the pure and true institution of Christ: for whereas the supper
ought to be celebrated unto this end; that we might communicate the sacrifice
of Christ, they being not therewith content did also add (oblation:) this
augmentation, I say, is vicious and naught. These Calvin.

Cent. 1^ col. 83. l. 14.
The Century-writers reprove S. Cyprian saying: the priest (says Cyprian) does
supply the place of Christ, and offers sacrifice to God the Father: And in

That Cyprian does superstitiously affirm the priest to supply the place of
Christ in the supper.

Cent. 2. c. 4 Col. 63.
Again: Although (say they) the Doctores, of this age have nothing of offering
an unbloody sacrifice to God in the Eucharist, yet there do occur in the^

Ignatius to the Smyrne^ses: It is not lawful (says Ignatius) without a
Bishope either to offerre sacrifices, or celebrate Masses Ibid l. 20. Ibid col.

Also they say the like of S. Irenaeus.

t S Irenaeus is so plain that they doubt not to chardge him with negligence,
and of being improper in his speech and often calling the Eucharist an oblation.

To conclude these foresaid sayings of Ignatius and Irenaeus who are so plain
to the Centuristes, that although they be likewise extant in all copies and
libraries; yet they blush not to say concerning that of Ignatius: Ibide^ line.

that they do partly supect it as inserted, concerning that of Irenaeus they
say.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
lib. de capt. Babylonie^ cap. 1.
Luther briefly answeareth to all this, saying: if there be nothing that can be
said, it is more save to deny all, then to grant the mass to be a sacrifice.

Again: I profess (says he) especially against all such, as shall cry out,
that I teach against the custom of the church, against the statures of the
Fathers, I profess (I say,) that I will hear none of this: And a little after
he says: I care not what the Fathers said of the mass.

Again in his book against king Henry the eight he says: last of all the
king brings in the sayings of the Fathers for amassing sacrifice, or the
sacrifice of the Mass, and laugheth at my foolishnes, that I only will seem
to be wise before all others, but I say, they have nothing to produce but a
multitude of me^. Et infra: I care not if therbe a thousand Augustines and a
thousand Cyprians against me.

Again. Here (says he) I nothing regard it, in lib. de missa priuat^
if the Papists cry out, the church, the church; the Fathers, Fathers, because
as I said we respect not men's sayings or deeds in so weighty matters: for we
know that the Prophets themselves have fallen, yea and the Apostles also: by
the word of Christ we judge the church, Apostles, yea and Angels themselves.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Calvin says: lib. 4 in^^^^. cap 1^.. 1.
let all readers understand that here I am to deall with that opinion, wherein
the Roman Antichrist and his Prophets have instructed the whole world, to wit,
that the mass is a work, whereby the priest that offers Christ, and others
that do participate, in that oblation do obtain the favor of God, or that
it is a satisfactory oblation, whereby to reconcile themselves unto God.
Again:. 3.
certainly this is most certain, the cross of Christ is made frustrate as soon
as the altar shall be erected.

Again. 11.
But because I see that those ancient Fathers also have wrested this otherwise
the^ was agreeable to the institution of our Lord (although their supper carry a
show of I know not what ancient or at least renewed oblation) I think they
cannot be excused, but they have some thing erred in the manner of doing, for
they have rather imitated the Jewish manner of sacrificing then that which
either Christ ordained, or the gospel did permit.

Again:. 1^.
what remains (says he) but that the blind may see, the deaf hear, and
children understand, that this abomination of the mass which is drunk in a
goulden cup, has so made drunk all kings of the earth, and people even
from the highest unto the lowest, and stricken them with such a dead sheep and
gidinesse in the head, that they are become more stupide then brute beasts, and
do place the very anchor hold and sum of their salvation in this only deadly
poison.

An old condemned Heresy.
lib. 2. contra ^^^^ianum.
S. Austine does report among the errors and furies of the Donatistes, that
whersoeuer they came they were accustomed to overthrow and break down
aulters, sell the holy Chalices etc. whereby it is manifest that the Donatistes
who also in times past did boast that they were the true reformers of Gods
church, and proclaimed themselves every where to be the true ancient and
orthodoxall Catholics, did notwithstanding also take away the sacrifice of
the mass.

THE 34. ARTICLE. Communion under both Kinds.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
It suffices the laytie, or common people to communicate under one form, to
wit of bread; for by this they fulfill the precept, to wit, that they eat the
body and blood of our Savior; this also our Savior and his Apostles have
practysed and that not without good reasons.

SCRIPTVRE.
John. 6.51.5^.
IF any man eat of this bread he shall live forever: and the bread which I will
give is my flesh for the life of the world. And he that eats this bread shall
live forever.

Act. 242.
And they were perseuering in the Doctrine of the Apostles, and in the
communication of the breaking of bread and prayers.

Act. 207,
And in the first of the Sabbath, when we were assembled to break bread.

Jesus going to Emaus with his Two Disciples.
Luke 24 30
And he entered with them and it came to pass, whilst he satte with them, he
took bread, and blessed and brake and gave to them; and their eyes were
openned and they knew him.

S. Austine and Theophylactus anno 400. do explicate this place, to be of the
Eucharist, as here following is manifest.

FATHERS.
S. Austine says: lib. de consensu Euang. cap. 25 upon th^se words their eyes
were ope^ned and they knew him and the same also sa th S. Chrysostom hom. 17.
oper. imper. etc alij upon the same place.
when he gave the blessed bread unto them, their eyes were openned and they
knew him. Et infra: we undoubtedly believe this impediment to be cast upon
their eyes by Satan, to the end they might not know Jesus, but notwithstanding
Christ permitted it even to the Sacrament of bread, that the unity of his body
being received, the impediment of the enemy might be known to be removed,
that Christ might be known.

Theophylactus says: There is another thing reported, to wit, that their eyes
who received the blessed bread, were openned, and they knew him, for the flesh
of our Lord has great and incredible force, and virtue.

Receive also this history, which may prove the receiving under one kind to be
practiced in the primitive church: it begins thus.

Sozomenus lib 8 cap 5. and Nicephorus, lib. 1^. cap. 7.
A certain man of Macedony being sick, had a wife infected with the same
disease: this man when on a certain time he chanced upon that excellent man
S. Chrysostom disputing what we ought to think of God, forthwith having
changed his former opinion, he praised his speeches, and was earnest enforcing
his wife, that she should likewise change her opinion. But when she through
the custom and daily conference with her fellow tatlers, did not accept his
admonition, nor her husband avayle any thing by all his perswasio^s, at length
in plain terms he told her, that unless she would hold the common and same
opinion of God, with him, she should remain with him no longer, the woman
afterward by simulatio^ granted his request, but revealed to one of her mayds,
which she thought to be very faithful, what she intended, that she might
deceive her husband, wherefore upon a time approaching, she received the
Sacrament as the manner was; and reteyning it as if she head bine earnest in
prayer bowing her self, she secretly conveyed it away, and hid the holy
mystery or Sacrament: and the maid that stood by, gave her a piece of common
bread for it, brought from their house, which she putting to her mouth and
endeavoring to break it with her teeth, perceived it to be turned into the
hard nature of a stone, wherefore stricken with fear, least God would reue^g
himself grievously upon her for this miracle, which happenned thus unlooked
for, with all speed she hastenned to that reverend and learned Father, and
opening the matter unto him, showed him the stone, which did as yet give certain
and manifest testimony of the biting; which stone had now lost his former
substance and gotten an other new and straung color. But she afterward having
obtained pardon for that fault, continued and so remained in the same opinion
with her husband. That stone, was reserved a long time among the gifts of the
church for a witness of this miracle to all spectatours These Nicephorus.

Last of all S. Thomas of Aquine, anno 1260. writes thus. It is the custom of
many churches, to give the body of Christ to be received of the people, but not
the wine.

Again: because the multitude of Christian people increased wherein are
comprehended both old and young men and children, whereof some are not of so
great discretion as to have due respect and care concerning the use of this
Sacrament, as they ought; therefore it is prouidently observed in some churches,
that the blood be not given to be received of the people, but only of the
priest.

Again: the body may be received by the people without the blood, neither does
any detrement thence follow, because whole Christ is contained under both
forms. These S. Thomas.

if in the primitive church in time of persecution (as these Fathers in the
margent witness) they did carry the sacred body of our Lord whom with them unto
their howses under the form of bread only and not of wine, it is manifest,
that the church never thought but that the whole Sacrament might be received
under one form without any offense or violation of the divine precept, which
also Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer do acknowledge in their several writings,
saying that the communion under one or both forms is a thing indifferent.

THE ADVERSARY.
Fricius a Chief protestant in Polonia says: That Christ in the last supper
did join drink with the meat, therefore (says he) if the church separate
these, she ought not to be heard: Let it be, or admit that the church of
Jerusalem has separated these, and that S. James (which certainly many
affirm) has given but one only form to them of Jerusalem: what then? the
word of God is clear and plain, eat ye, and drink ye; this we must here,
this we ought to prefer before all Jacobs, and all words of the church, no
otherwise then God is preferred before the church. These he.

Brentius also a Chief protestant in Germany most evidently affirms the
same, according to the sentence and decree of the whole church of wirtem.
saying: Both S. Peter (says he) prince of the Apostles and S. Barnabas after
they had received the holy ghost, did err together with the whole church of
Jerusalem.

Luther says: if the Council should in any case decree this (the communion to
be received under both kinds of bread and wine) least of all then would we
use both kinds, yea rather in the despite of the Council and that decree, we
would use either but one kind only, or neither, and in no case both.

in parua con ^essione.
Also he says concerning the elevation of the Sacrament: I did know (says he)
the elevation of the Sacrament to be Idolatricall (as making for sacrifice) yet
nevertheless I did reteyne it in the church at wittemberg: to the end I might

conductor, and chariote of Israel. infinite might besaid of him in this kind,
but I spare my labor in so Idle a business.

THE 35. ARTICLE. Of Confession.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
Christ did so committ the keys of the kingdom of heaven unto his Church,
that whatsoever her ministers, the priests of the new testament, do bind or
loose in earth, is bound or loosed in heaven, saying: whose sins soever ye
shall remitt, they are remitted the^; and whosoever you shall reteyn, they are
retained, therefore they have power (which they exercise in the place of Christ)
to absolve co^trite sinners, and such as confess.

SCRIPTVRE.
Matt. ^.
ANd they were Baptized by him in Iordane Confessing their sins. S. Luke has
the same.

Joan. 20. v. 22.23.
Receive ye the holy ghost, whose sins ye shall forgoue they are forgiven, and
whose you shall reteyne they are retained.

Act. 19.18.
And many of them that believed came confessing their sins and declaring their
deeds.

James 5.16
Confess theirfore your sins on to and other.

FATHERS.
Sermon. 5. de lapsis.
S. Cyprian anno 240. says: Finally how much more great is their faith, and
fear of God more commendable, who, although not giultie of any heinous crime
or fact where of they need by Sacrifice to be purged: yet because they have
thought of some such thing, they confessed the same with great sorrow unto the
priests of God, and simply confessing, do clear their conscience by
expressing the burden of their soul, and seek for a wholesome medicine, though
their wounds be little and small: Et infra: let every one I pray you brethren,
confess his sin, whilst the sinner yet lives whilst his confession may be
admitted, whilst the satisfaction and absolution given by the priest is
acceptable to God.

Homil 17. in Lucam.
Origin anno 230. expounding the words: That the cogitations of many hearts may
be revealed. says: Where upon we also if we have sinned must say: I have made
my sin known unto thee, and I have not hidd mine iniquity, I have said, I
will declare mine unrighteousness unto our lord against my self. For if we
shall do this and reueal our sins not only unto God, but to those also that can
heal our wounds and sins, our sins shall be blotted out by him, that says;
behold I drive away thine iniquities as a cloud, and thy sins as darkness.

lib. 4. ca 17. de diuina^um instit.
Lactantius anno 320. showing the reason why God commanded circumcision in the
old testament says: for this cause God commanded that flesh to to be made
naked, that heerby he might admonish us, not to have a secret heart, that is;
not to keep hidden any foul sin within the priuitie of the conscience, this
is the Circumcision of the heart, where of the Prophets spoke, which God has
translated from the mortal flesh to the soul, which Circumcision only shall
continue, for he being desirous to provide for our life and salvation,
according to his eternal love toward us has in that Circumcision propounded
or set before us penance, that if we will make clean our heart, that is, if
we will by confessing our sins so satisfy God, we may obtain pardon, which
is denied to the stubborn and such as hide their sins, for he beholds not
the outward face as man does, but the inward secreats of the heart.

Again: lib. 4. cap. 30* contra Nouationos
he opposes confession used in the Catholic Church, against the Nouations as
a true note or mark whereby to know the true Catholic Church; saying: Because
every company of heretics (says he) think them selves the best Christian,
and their own Church to be the Catholic Church, we must know that to be the
true Church, wherim is confession and penance, which with wholesome medicines
cure those sins and wounds where unto the weakness of the flessh is subject.

S. Athanasius anno 340. upon those words: In Sermon ad finem.
go unto the villadge over against you and you shall find a coult bound: says
thus: Let us examine our selves whether our bonds be loosed, that we may
profitt the more; and if thy bonds be not yet loosed, go unto the disciples of
Jesus, for they be at hand, who by that authority which they have received
from our Savior, can absolve thee, for he says; what soever you shall bind on
earth, shall be bound also in heaven, and whose sins you shall remitt they are
remitted unto them.

S. Hilarie anno 350. says: Can. 18. in Matthew.
But for the terror of that greatest fear, whereby all men for the present
ought to be kept in awe, he has appointed the immovable judgment of
Apostolical severity, that whomesoeuer they shall bind upon earth, as is,
whosoever they shall leave wrapped in the fetters of their sins, and
whomesoeuer they shall absolve, that is, receive by confession, into the
blessed state of Pardon, or unto salvation, these men are also by the order of
Apostolical judgment either absolved or bound in heaven.

In quaest. sieve regulis bremoribus reg. 229.
S. Basil anno 380. says: In the confession of our sins, there is altogether
one and the same course to be taken, which is in declaring the diseases of our
body. for as men do not declare the diseases of their bodies rashly to every
man, but to those only that know the means how to cure them; even so we must
make confession of our sins, unto those men that can heal them.

reg. 229.
Again: We must of necessity (says he) confess our sins unto them that have
the dispensation of the mysteries of the son of God.

lib. de paenit. cap. 6.
S. Ambrose anno 380. says: if thou will be justified, confess thy sin: for
the reverend confession of sins dissolueth or loses us from the bonds of our
offenses.

Again: Is it tolerable (says he) that thou should be a shamed to entreat
God, who art not a shamed to pray unto God, from whom thou cast not hid thy
self, for as much as thou art not a shamed to confess thy sins to man, from
whom thou may hide thy self?

In vita S. Ambrosij.
S. Paulinus anno 400. says: That as often as any man did confess his sins
unto S. Ambrose for the desire of penance, he did weep so that he compelled
him also to weep, he seemed to be a sinner with the sinner; but he declared
the crimes which they confessed unto him to none but to God only, unto whom he
made intercession for them.

In epist. ad Episcopum Myttelen. cap. 1.
S. Greg. Nyss. anno 380. says: It is well done, if at this day we may bring
those men that have bine changed through regeneration by the grace of
baptism, but if we bring some also by pennaunce and confession, such we lead
as it were by the hand from dead works to the way of life, and a lively hope,
from which they were separated by sin: Again: as in the healing of the body
(says he) there is one intension to heal the sick man: but there is a diverse
way of healing (for according to the variety of diseases a convenient medicine
and discipline is applied to every grief) so, for as much as their is great
variety of affections in the mind, and diseases of the soul, the curing
medicine must also necessarily be monifold, using a medicine according to the
state of the affection.

Again: In orat. in mulicrem peccatricem
declare bouldly (says he) to the priest the hidden secrets of thy heart, as
thou would do thy secret wounds to a physician, he will have a care both of
thy honor and health.

S. Pacianus anno 350, says: In paraenesi ad paenitentiam.
I speak unto you first my brethren who having committed sins, refuse
pennaunce; you, I say, who after impudency are become fearful, after sining
shamfac'd, who blush not to sin, but are a shamed to confess. Et infra: Behold
the Apostle says again to the priest: lay, or impose hands suddenly upon no
man least thou communicate with other men's sins. What will thou do? that
deceauest the priest, or deceauest the ignorant, or confoundest one of no great
understanding, with the difficulty of the thing to be proved. Again: I
beseech you brethren even for respect of my peril and for our lords sake,
whom no hidden secrets can deceive, that hereafter you would no more hide your
wounded consciences: sick men if wise, are not afraid of the physician when he
cuteth them, or burns them even in their secret parts.

S. Chrysosiome anno 380. says: Homil. 33. i^ Joan.
In confessing our sins that we have committed let us fear no man. Let us
only fear God, as it is meet, who both now sees our works and then will
condemn such as will not do pennaunce now: Et infra: Beloved I exhort you that
although no man see your actions; yet that every one of you would make a search
of his own conscience, and judging reasonably upon himself let him bring his
sins to light; except they will have them manifested to all the world in the
dreadful day of judgment: let our wounds be healed, let the medicine of
pennaunce be received.

Again: lib. 2. de Sacerdotio.
wherefore (says he) we have need of great wisdom, that those Christians
which be sinners may willingly persuade them selves, that they ought to submitt
them selves to be healed by the priest.

in comm. ad 10 cap Ecclesiastae.
S. Hierome anno 380. says: if the Serpent the Devil have stounge any man,
and infected him with the poison of sin, though no man be privy unto it; if he
that is thus wounded shall hold his peace, and and shall not do penance, nor
confess his wound to his brother and Master, who has a tongue also to heal
him, he can hardly do him good; for if the sick man be ashamed to confess his
wound to the physician, the medicine heals not, what the physician knows
not.

in comm. ad cap. 16. ^at.
Again: we read (says he) in Leuiticus concerning leapers, where they are
commanded to show them selves unto the priest, and if they have the leaprosie,
then they are made clean by the priest* not that the priest makes a man a
leaper or unclean, but that they may have knowledge of the leaper, and may
discern who is clean and who is unclean, therefore as the priest makes a man
clean, or unclean, so also the Bishop and priest here binds or loses,
those that are innocent, or guilty, but according to his duty when he has
heard the variety of sins, and knows who is to be bound or loosed.

In Epist. 1. ad Decenaeum Epist E^gubinum cap. 7.
S. Innocent. 1. Pope anno 402. says: It is the duty of the priest, to judge
according to the weightines of offenses, also to mark the confession, weeping,
and tears of the penitent, and then to dischargd him when he shall see due
satisfaction.

lib. 50. homiliarum homil. 12.
S. Austine anno 400. says: Our God because he is gentle and merciful, will
have us to confess our sins in this world that we be not confounded by them
in the world to come.

Ibid. homil. 41.
Again: a man (says he) ought to keep himself from these vices not only
after, but before penance, being in state of grace, because if he shall
continue therein until the end of his life, he knows not whether he shall be
able to do penance, and make his confession to God and the priest or not.

Tractatu super Psalm. 66.
Again: be thou sorrowful before thou have confessed, but having confessed,
rejoice for thou art now whole. Before thou hadest confessed, thy conscience
was laden with filthy matter, the impostume swelled, it tormented thee, and
did not suffer thee to rest: the physician applies cheerful mitigations, and
some time cuteth, and uses his curing Iron in the corruption of tribulation,
acknowledge thou the physicians hand, confess, let all filthy corruption
depart and fleet away in confession, and now rejoice and be glade, for that
which remains will easily be healed.

Again: he that is sorry let him be heartily sorry, Idem S. Augustinus vel
quisquis Author est libri de vera and false poenit. cap. 10.
and show his grief by tears, and present his life unto God by the priest, let
him prevent the judgment of God by confession; for our lord has commanded the
pure in heart, to open their mouth unto the priest, teaching that sins ought to
be confessed by corporal presence not by a messenger, or made known by
writing. Et infra* where for he that will confess his sins, thereby to obtain
grace, let him seek a priest, one that knows when to bind, and when to loose
or absolve, least, that being found negligent about himself he be neglected by
him that does mercifully admonish him.

Again: if the sin be secret, cap. 11.
it suffices to make it known to the priest.

S. Leo Pope anno 450. says: In epist. 80. ad Episcopos Campaniae.
for as much as it suffices if the guilt of the conscience be made known unto
the priest only by secret confession etc. And a little after: that confession
is sufficient which is made first unto God, next also unto the priest.

S. Greg. Pope anno 600. explicating those words: Homil 26. in Euang. etc.
Whose sins ye shall remitt they are remitted unto them. says: We must
understand (says he) what is the fault, and what penance does follow the
offense that whom admightie God does visit by the grace of compunction, those
the sentence of the pastor may absolve.

THE ADVERSARY.
Cent. 3. c. 6. col. 27. l. 28.
The Century-vriters affirm that in the times of S. Cyprian and Tertullian
there was used private confession even of thoughts and lesser sins, then so
commanded and thought necessary.

Calvin institut. l. 1. ca. 4. sect. 8. Cent 3. col. 127. l. 44.
Calvin and the Centuristes do further affirm that even in the primitive
Church, open confession was first made and pennaunce enjoined, the priest did
then after wards absolve the penitent even with the now like used Ceremony of

M. Whitaker says that Innocentius the third anno 1198. was the first that
instituted auriculer or private confession, as a thing necessary.

Upon the revelations page 57.
M. Symondes says: That Leo the first anno 450. first brought in auriculer or
private confession. How these two agree, I pray note: But to answer at least
the one of them, Guido de Iacobitis.
It is evident that the Iacobites vere condemned anno 600. For affirming, that
we ought to confess our sins to God only, and that confession of sins to a
priest is not need full.

But if this use of confession was first brought in by either of these men, it
being a Doctrine before that time straung and unheard off, what father or other
writer of that age then resisted it? or who is witness to this Chaung? here M.
Withaker is silent.

Cent. ^. c. 6. ^oc. 127. l. 27.
The Centuristes do also yet affirm that they gave absolution from sins, if
those that did pennaunce had first confessed their sins for in this manner (say
they) Tertullian does earnestly urge confession in his book of pennaunce: Also
(say they) private confession was very usual, wherein they confessed both
their offenses, and private thoughts as appears in some places of Cyprian, as
in his fifth Sermon de lapsis.

lib. 1. de poenitentia cap. 2.
To conclude therefore this point, S. Ambrose says of the Nouations: But (says
he) they say that they give reverence to our lord, to whom only power to
forgive sins is reserved. yea none do greater injury then such as violate his
commandment: for when as our lord himself has said in his gospel. receive
ye the holy ghost, whose sins ye forgive they are forgiven etc. who then does
rather honor him, he that obeys his commandment, or he that resists
them? These S. Ambrose.

Again: Ibid. cap. 7.
why do you Baptize (says he) if it be not lawful that sins be forgiven by
man? for as much as remission of all sins is given (by man) in Baptism, what
matter is it whether priests do challeng this power given them, either by
penance or the lauer, the ministry is one and the same in both?

S. Pallanus says: In epist. 1. ad Sympronianum Nouatianum.
God would never three^ dat he that is not penitent, unless he would pardon
the penitent. Thou will say (says he) God only can do this, it is true, but
yet in that he does it by his priests, it is his power. for what is that which
he says to his Apostles: whatsoever you shall bind on earth etc.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther says: Confession is good and profitable, lib. de capt. Babyl. cap. de
paenir. also in vsitatione sun Saxonica in Sermon ne panit. in articulis Small
caldicis art. de confessione lib. de ratione consitendi, cap. 6. lib. contra
Latonium in ^ssert. articul. art. ^.
but not ordained by God, and therefore not necessary. also he says that all
sins ought not to be confessed, neither venial nor mortal, but such as are
manifestly mortal.

Moreover he will have confession to be free that the penitent may at his
pleasure, and as he shall think good confess what he list, and in an other
place he doubts whether any sin ought to be confessed; and finally at length
he takes it quit a way saying: I plainly deny that confession ought to be
exacted at all. And therefore calls it, a most bloody butcherie, if any man
crave of the penitent, confession of all or any of their sins.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
Lib. 3. cap. 4.. 5.
Caeluin: I marvel (says he) with what countenance they dare defend
confession, which they say is commanded by God, indeed we confess the use of
it is most ancient, but we ca^ easily prove that in times past it was free,
and without obligation. Ibid. What soever all the Pops wilful hirelinges do
babble. we hold that Christ was never Author of this law which forces men to
number their sins, yea for one thousand and two hundredth years after the
resurrection of our Savior, there was never any such law made. therefore this
tyranny was then first brought in when all piety and doctrine being quite
extincte the ghostes of Pastors did without any understanding, take unto them
selves all liberty. 13.
Again: when we treat of the keys we must always take heed, that we do
not dream of any faculty or power separate from the preaching of the
gospel. 19.
Again: It is no marueyle then if we condemn this auriculer confession, as a
pestilent thing, being so many ways hurtful unto the Church, and desire to
have it utterly taken away.

23.
Again: but in that they seem from hence to scrape testimonies to prove that
it do not suffice to confess sins to God only or lay men, but that the priest
must know of it, their diligence is shameful and wicked. For if the ancient
Fathers do at nny time persuade sinners, to disburden them selves unto their
pastor, it cannot be understood of any recyting or such like matter. [wher of
then? as he does not know, so he does not explicate] yet a little after he
says: although they teach a gross error, in saying that it ought to be
declared by word, they trust in a ceremony in stead of Doctrine.

An old condemned Heresy.
This was the heresy and chief error of the Nouations, witness Theodoretut
lib. de haeret. fab. and S. Cornelius Papa apub Eusebius. l 6. hist. cap. 33.
that the Church and priests of Christ had no power to absolve sinners, and
reconcile them again unto God.

THE 36. ARTICLE. Of Satisfaction.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
A man justified may truly Satisfy God for the giult of his temporal pain,
wherefore there may justly be enjoined Satisfactory works, as fasting,
abstinence, Alms deeds and discipline, also chastisement of the body for a
pain and punishment to such as fall and are penitent: and such men also may
piously and with great profit undertake the same, and fulfill it.

the evil in his days.

FATHERS.
1. Concilium Vacense. anno 442. brings in S. Peter speaking thus: if
peradventure either envy, or infidelity or any of those Mischiefs which you
have spoken of before, shall secretly creep into any man's heart: Let him not be
ashamed to confess those things unto him, that has the care of the government
of his soul, that he may be cured by him through the word of God and wholesome
Council, whereby through sound faith and good works, he may avoyde the pains
of eternal sier, and obteyn the rewards of life everlasting.

S. Dionysius Areopagita anno 80. Epist. 6.
Vehemently rebukes Demophilus the monk, because with his foot he thrust away
a sinner that had submitted and prostrated himself at the knees of the priest,
being about to confess his sins, and receive absolution from the same.

S. Iustine Martyr anno 150. Quaest. 79.
asks a question why God permitted king Josias to be slain with a sword,
being a most holy man, and he answers in these words: Certainly Josias had a
woeful end of his life, because he obeyed not the command of Hieremias, who
said unto him by Gods command, that he should not proceed to meet the king of
Aegipt in battayl, as Hieremias says: Wherefore that our lord might receive him
out of this world purified from his sins; he therefore gave him to be punished
for his disobedience by the sword of the Aegiptians.

S. Irenaeus anno 160. says: Lib. 4. cap. 28 in fine.
He tought that he should do those things that were commanded by God from
the beginnig, and that they should disolue the old concupiscence by good
works, and follow Christ: and that those things which men possess, being
distributed to the poor, do make a dissolution of that concupiscence past.
Tacheus Makes it manifest, saying behold I give one half of my goods to the
poor.

lib. de paenit.
Tertullian anno 200. says: thou have offended but thou may yet be
reconciled. thou have one, to whom thou may make Satisfaction. Et infra:
Satisfaction is wrought by confession. And a little before he says: what a
foolish thing is it, not to fulfill our penance and so to obtain the pardon
of our sins? this is as much as not to pay the price and yet to say hold on the
marchandice, for our lord has appointed to grant pardon for this price: he
has determined that a full discharge from punishment should be obtained by
this Satisfaction of penance.

homii. 6. in Exodus
Origin. anno 230. says: if any man peradventure being deceived by the Devil,
has received such money, let him not altogether despair, for our lord is
merciful and full of compassion, and desires not the death of his creature,
but rather that he be converted and live; by penance, weeping, and
Satisfaction let him blott out that which is committed.

homil. 3. in lib. Iud.
Again, See (says he) how our merciful lord mixeth his mercy with severity,
and measures the pain it self by a just and mild weight. he does not whereby
reject offenders, but as long time as thou know thou have erred, as long
time as thou have offended, so much the more humble thy self unto God, and
satisfy him by the confession of penance.

Sermon do opere and Elcemosynis.
S. Cyprian anno 240. says: [Neither should infirmity have any humane frailty,
which imbecility could over come, unless divine piety helping justice by the
works of mercy again did open acertayn way to defend salvation, so that
afterward we may wash away by Alms what soever filth we gather or contract;
the holy ghost speaks in the Scripture and says: sins are purged by alms
and faith, not those sins which weere formerly committed, for those are
purged by the blood and satisfaction of Christ:] Where we may observe that he
puts a manifest difference between Baptism and penance.

Again: We must pray unto our lord, Sermon de lapsis.
we must pacify our lord by our satisfaction. Et infra ad finem: we ought to
pray and beseech more earnestly, and to pass the day in murning with whole
nights in watchinges and tears, and to the prostrate in ashes and hearcloth,
and humble in filth etc. he that shall in this sort satisfy God and through
the penance of his fact, and shame of his offense conceive more force and faith
for the very grief of his fall, being now hear and having obtained his request
of our lord, he shall make the Church glade which before the had made
sorrowful, and shall not now deserve only pardon of God, but also a crown.

lib 6. de vero cultu cap. 24.
Lactantius anno 320. says: he may be brought back again, if he be sorry for
his sins, and being converted unto a better course of life, may satisfy God.

in Psalm. 118. v. 136.
S. Hilarie anno 350. says expounding that of the Psalm. [Mine eyes have
gushed out issues of waters because they have not kept thy law: [This says he
is the voice of penance, to pray with tears, to shigh with tears, and through
this confidence say. I will wash my bed every night. this is the pardon of sin,
to weep with a fountain of weeping, and to be made wett with a shower of
tears.

in oratione super illa verba: Attend tibi etc.
S. Basil anno 380. says: have a care of thy self, that according to the
proportion of thy offense thou may be changed by this, and haueing a
medicine procure thy own health, is the sin great and grievous? thou have
great need of confession bitter tears, earnest contention in watchings long
and continued fasting* is the offense light and not intolerable, let this also
be satisfied by penance.

in epist. 82. ad Ecclesiam vercelle^sem
S. Ambrose anno 380. says how can we be saved unless we wash a way our
sins by fasting.

Again: ad Virginem laps^m cap. 8.
a deep wound must have a great and large medicine: a great sin must of
necessity have great satisfaction.

Again: in lib. de Elia and Ieiunio cap 2^.
we have (says he) many helps where by to redeem our sins* have thou money
to redeem thy sin* our lord is not to be sold but thou art to be sold, yea
thou art sold by thy sins, redeem thy self by thy works, redeem thy self
by thy money.

^n orat. de paupetum ^more prope ex^rema.
S. Greg. Naz. anno 380. says: f Sins are purged by mercy, and faith,
therefore let us purge our selves by mercy, and wash a way the filth and spots
of our soul with that herb, and become white, some as wool, others as snoe,
to wit, according to the proportion of mercy.

In paraenesi ad paenitentia^.
S. Pa^^nus anno 350. says: I beseech thee and earnestly pray thee, that thou
be not ashamed of this work, that it be not irksome unto thee with all speed to
embrace necessary remedies unto salvation, to give thy mind unto sorrow, to
wrape thy body in saccloth, to tumble in ashes, to afflick thy self by fasting,
to work, and be earnest in prayer. wherein you do not spare your own
punishment, therein God will spare you. Et infra: behold I promise you, if you
return unto your Father with true satisfaction, not sinning any more, or
adding any thing to your former sins, but saying also some humble and
mournful saying: Father, we have sinned in thy sight: and are no more worthy
to be called thy sons, presently that unclean beast and deformed meat of husks
will depart from you.

Epist. 1. cap. 7.
S. Innocentius anno 402. says: But concerning the esteeming of the weight of
sins, it belongs unto the priest to judge; and to attend unto the confession
of the penitent, and to the weeping and tears of him that corrects.

S. Leo anno 440. says; Sermon 1. de ^^^unio decimi mensis.
the mercy of God is obtained by prayer, the concupiscence of the flesh is
extinguished by fasting, sins are redeemed by Alms.

Again: Speaking of penitent priests he says: Epist. 92. ad Rusticum cap. 2.
such as have fallen, ought privately to retire them selves, to obteyn the ^ercy
of God; whereby also their satisfaction may be come fruitful unto them, if it
be worthy.

In cap. 1. Ioelis.
S. Hierome anno 380. explicating that of the Prophet Joel: Gird your selves
and mourn etc. says: he that is a sinner, and whom his own conscience does
bite, let him put on hearcloth, and mourn either for his own sins or for the
sins of the people, and let him Go into the church, from which he had
strayed by his sins, and let him ly and sleep in saccloth, thereby to
recompense his former delights, by which he had offended God, with the
austeritie of his life.

S. Augustine anno 400. says: in Euchiridio. cap. 70.
we must change and amend our life, God does not become merciful for our
sins past by alms: he is not to be sought after for this, that we might
have leave always freely and without punishment offend, for he gives no man
license to sin, although he do blot out sins committed, by his mercy, if
due satisfaction be not neglected.

Again: as for daily light sins, and of small moment, cap. 71.
without which no man lives, the daily prayer of the faithful does satisfy
for such.

Again: homil. 50. cap. 11.
let the sinner come unto the prelate by whom the keys of the church are
governed, and as it were now beginning to be a son, according to ancient
custom let him receive the measure of his satisfaction from such as are over
the Sacraments. Et infra: it does not suffice to amend our manners, cap. 15.
and leave our wicked customs, unless we do also satisfy God, for such
things as we have already committed etc.

S. Maximus anno 420. says: he is not reprehended, homil. in di^ cinerum.
that has heretofore by an erroneous heart and slipperie course of life fallen
from the right way unto salvation, and does now again endeavor to be
reconciled unto God by sorrourfull satisfaction of penance.

S. Greg. anno 601. says: lib. 6. in 1. Reg. explicans, cap. 15.
sins ought not only to be confessed, but also blotted out by the austoritie
of penance, Ibid. indeed, sins that are corrigible are suffered, because the
offender does after wards reject them, and they may very well be purged by
satisfaction.

THE ADVERSARY.
The Cent. ^, col. 127. l. 40. See also M. Whitaker contr. camp rat. 5. page
78. and himself also alleged in M Fulkes def. of the English tra^slations ca.
13 page 68.
Centuri-wryters affirm that penance or satisfaction was enjoined according to
the offense, and that the same Fathers thought by such their external
discipline of life, to pay the pains due unto sins, and to satisfy Gods
justice, and that not Cyprian only, but almost all the holy Fathers of that
age, were in that error.

Toby 129.
Alms does deliver from death and does purge all sin.

Again: cap 410.
Alms does deliver from death and suffers not the (soul) to go into
darkness.

Ecclesi^sticus cap. 333.
Water quenches burning sier, and alms resists sins.

This place of Ecclesiasticus, and the other of Toby are so evident that the
ministers of lincoln Diocese say: in their abridgment etc. page 76.
The twoe places of Toby and ecclesiasticus tend daungerously to the justifying
of the merit of alms deeds.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
in assert. articulor. art. 5.
I mortally hate (says he) and earnestly desire that term (satiefaction) to be
taken quite away, which not only is not found in scripture, but it has a
dangerous sense, as if any man could satisfy God for his sin, when as he does
freely pardon althings, wherefore (says he) I said, that true satisfaction is
not found neither in the scriptures, nor in the fathers.

in Apolog. confessionis Augustanae art. de co^fess. and satisfactione.
Philipp Melanchthon Luthers Scholl^r, says: But yet our adversaries (says
he) confess that satisfactions do not profit unto the remission of the fault,
but do fame that satisfactions profit to redeem the pains, either of
purgatory, or other payns. Et infra: this is ameere fiction, and a thing newly
invented without authority either of scripture, or ancient ecclesiastical
writters.

Again: in locis commun. tit. de satisfactione prope finem, de carnis
mortificationibus.
such manner (says he) of voluntary mortifications or tormentings belong
unto that rule: in vain do they worship me with the commandments of men:
also it is against these precepts. Thou shall not Kill and that* Give honor to
the body: who ever heard of a more sweeter gospel then this of Luthers?

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
They assign (says he) the third place of satisfaction in penance, lib. 3.
instit. cap. 3.. 30.
whereof, whatsoever they babble, it may all be confuted in one word they say it
does not suffice the penitent to abstain from sins past, and to amend his
manners, unless he do satisfy God for that which he has committed: they say
there are many helps, whereby we may redeem our sins, as tears, fastinges,
oblations and the offices of charity. And a little after: against such lies I
oppose free remission of sins and that which is gratis, then which there is
nothing more clearly mentioned in the scriptures, what I pray you has Christ
done for us, if the punishment for sin should still be exacted, for when we
say that he suffered for all our sins upon the cross we signify no other
thing then that he died with that pain and reueunge which was de for our
sins. Et infra: I know that they speak yet more subtly, when as they
distinguish between eternal pain and temporal pains, but in that they say
temporal pain is a certain punishment, which God does take as well of the
body as the soul, excepting only eternal death, this restraint does little
avail them.

Again:. 38.
all those things which do every where occur in the writings of the fathers
concerning satisfaction, do little move me. I see indeed that many of them, yea
I will speak plainly, almost all, whose books are now extant, that in this
matter they did either err, or speak to bitter and harsh.

. 39.
Again: [But they called it for the most part, satisfaction, not a recompense,
which should be rendered unto God, but a public testification, whereby such as
were punnished with excommunication, when they would be received into communion
again, they did make their penance known unto the church:] And a little
after: [confessions and satisfactions which are at this day in use, took their
beginning from that old ceremony, indeed a viperous brood, whereby it is come
to pass that there is not so much as a shadow left of any better custom. I
know that the ancient writters did speak sometime to hardly in this matter,
neither peradventure (as I said even now) did they err therein.]

lib. 4 cap. 12.. 8.
Again: the immodest authority (says he) of the ancient writers can by no
means be excused, which does altogether swerve and dissent from the precept of
God, and is very dangerous; where also he says that S. Cyprian was not so
strickt, but, S. Chrysostom was more exact.

THE 37. ARTICLE. Of the Single life of Priests and Clergy men.
THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
Virginity and single life is far more excellent and convenient for divine
exercices them wedlock, or matrimony, wherefore it does chiefly become priests
and the ministers of the church to be so, and that they are justly bound unto
it by holy Cannons and vow.

SCRIPTVRE.

lib. de virgin. extremo.
S. Athanasius anno 380. says: O virginity, a never failing riches, an
immortal crown, the temple of God, the Dwelsing house of the holy ghost, a
precious pearl invisible to the world, the joy of the Prophets, the glory of
the Apostles, the life of Angels, the crown of Saints.

lib. de virginibus.
S. Ambrose anno 380. says let no man maruail if they be compared to Angels,
which are coupled with our Lord.

Catechesi 12.
S. Cyrill Hierosol. anno 350. says: let us not be ignorant of the glory of
chastity: for it is an Angelical crown, yea this perfection is above man.

in 2. Dialogo.
b. Su^pitius anno 420. says: o blessed beauty and worthy of God.

lib. de virginitate cap. 31.
S. Austine anno 400. says: Therefore when professors of perpetual continency
shall compare themselves unto those that are married, they shall find that
according to the scriptures they are far inferior unto them, both in work,
desert, vow, and reward, also then presently does that saying come into their
mind: by how much the more greater thou art, so much the more humble thy self
in all things.

cap. 8.
Again: also no fruitfullnes of the flesh can be compared to holy virginity,
but because it is dedicated unto God, it is honored, which although it be kept
in the flesh, yet the spirit is kept in religion and devotion, and hence it is
also that virginity of the body, which continency, does vow and keep, is
spiritual.

hom 23. in librum number.
Origin anno 230. says: It is certain (says he) that the perpetual sacrifice
is hindered by such as serve the necessities of matrimony, wherefore it seems
unto me, that it belongs unto his office only, that does continually and
perpetually vow chastity.

S. Eusebius anno 330. says: lib. 1. demo^strat. Euangel. cap 9.
notwithstanding it be comes such, as have received holy orders and are
employed in the ministry and worship of God, to keep themselves ever
afterward from the company of a wife.

Epiphanius anno 390. says: ad finem operis contra haeaeses.
holy priesthood is received for the most part either of virgins, or of
solitory men, or if these do not suffice for the ministry, then it is
received by such as absteyne from their own wyfes, and if any man have been
from the beginning a continent widower, he may have the place of a Bishop,
priest, Deacon, subdeacon etc.

Again: haeresi. 59. quae est Catharorum.
but (says he) the church receaueth not him that has a wife yet liueing and
gets children, but him that does contain himself from his wife, or has
lived in widow hood.

S. Chrysostom anno 380. says: he did not say, homil de paticutiae Job.
a man of one wife, to this end that it should now be observed in the church
for it behooves a priest altogether to be adorned with all chastity.

S. Greg. Nyss. anno 380. says: lib. de virginit. cap. vltimo.
how do thou fulfill the priesthood of God, that art for this only end
anointed, to offerre up sacrifice? how will thou offerre up these things unto
God, that do not obey the law which forbideth thee to handle holy things
vnpurely? as if thou should desire God to appear unto thee, and tell the some
cause why thou should not obey Moses, who said unto the people, that they
should abstayn from marriage thereby to be hold the sight of God.

S. Ambrose anno 380. says: lib. 1. de efficijs cap. vlt.
you know that it is apure and an immacualate ministry, and not to be
violated by any company of wedlock, and that being of a sound body and
uncorrupted shamfastnes, absteyning altogether from the company of wedlock,
you do receive the grace of that holy ministry, which I would not therefore
omit, because some that govern the ministry or priesthood, in many secret
places, have begotten children.

Again: says he: epist. 82. ad Eccl. Vercellensem.
The Apostle said, one haueing children, not one begetting children.

Again: in comm. 1. epist. ad Timoth. cap. 1.
ever afterward (says he) they are restrained from the use of a woman.

Again: Item in cap. 3.
if the Apostle (says he) did command the common people to absteyn for a
time, thereby to give themselves the more fervent unto prayer, how much more did
he command levites, and priests, whom it behooves to pray night and day, for
the people committed unto them? for they ought to be more pure then others,
because they are the agents of God, or that deal for God.

lib. contra vigilantium Grecae principium.
S. Hierome anno 380. says: what will the churches of the East do? that which
they of Aegipt and the Apostolical seat do, which receive for clergy men,
either virgins, or such as are continent, or if they have wives, they cease to
be husbands.

Again: in sine Apologiae pro libris contra Iouinianum.
Bishops, (says he) priests, and Deacons, are chosen either virgins, or
widows, or certainly after priesthood, they remain chaste.

Again: in comm. ca. 1. ad Tit.
if laymen (says he) be commanded to abstain from the company of their
wives for prayer, what must we think of a Bishop, who does daily offerre up
pure sacrifices unto God for his own sins and the sins of the people?

Item lib. 1. contra Iouinianum.
Again: (says he) if a virgin be married, says the Apostle, she has not
sinned, not that virgin which has once dedicated herself to the worship of
God, for if any of these shall marry, she shall have damnation, because she
has made her first faith void or frustrate, for virgins that are married
after consecration, are not so much adulterous as incestuous.

lib. ad Iulianum, de bono viduitatis cap. 9.
S. Augustine anno 400. says: In the continency of widowhood the excellency
of a more large gift is sought, which being obtained, and chosen, and offered
up for the due of the vow, they cannot only now not marry, but also if they be
not married, it is damnable to desire it, for that the Apostle might signify
as much he did not say, they are married in Christ, but they will be married,
having their damnation, because the faith* or promise of the vow being broken
it is condemned.

Against the frivolous objections and excuses of impudent heretics, vvherin
they pretend that it is not possible for a man to vovv and perform his vovv of
chastity or continency.
Origin says: tract. 7. in Matthew.
It is a great thing for a man to geld himself for the kingdom of heaven, all
men do not receive this to whom it is given, and it is given to all men that
desire such a grace from God.

S. Greg. Naz. says: all men do not receive this, in orat. 30. quae incipit
Jesus qui piscatores elegit.
but those to whom it is given; add now (says he) thus much, that it is
verily given to them that will, and that do give themselves unto it.

S. Chrysostom says: Christ (says he) shows us that we may keep
perpetual virginity, saying: homil. 63. in Matthew.
there are Eunuchs which from their mothers womb, etc. all do not take it,
but unto whom it is given: it is given to them that do freely and of their
own accord choose it, which therefore he said, to show that we need help from
above, which certainly is prepared for all, if we will be come conquerours in
this contention.

homil. 16. in epist. ad Hebr.
Again: do not say (says he) I cannot live continent, for many cannot because
they will not, for if all would, all might perform it, therefore S. Paul says: I
would that all men were as I myself am; because he did know that all men
might be as himself was: this he would never have spoken, if it had bine
impossible. These S. Chrysostom.

M. Whitaker gives example in Pope Siricius saying: Siricius was the first that
annexed perpetual chastity to the ministers of the word. But yet Pope Damasus,
his paredecessour says of the very point now in question: if married men
(says he) like not this, let them not be angry with me, but with the holy
scriptures, with all Bishops, Priests, and Deacons who know they cannot offer
sacrifice, if they use the act of mariadge.

Luther says: I do not acknowledge (says he) the holy ghost in this (first)
Nycene council because it forbids him that has gelded himself, to be made
priest, and also commands the clergy to have none dwelling with them, but
their mother. Sister, their fathers Sister, their mothers Sister etc. Had
(says he) the holy ghost no other thing to do but to bynd his ministers to
such imposed dangerous, and not necessary laws.

Whereas our adversaries object Paphnusius to have resisted this opinion in the
first Nycene council, it appears by Socrates, Zozomene, the Century-wryters,
and M. Fulke, that though Paphnutius thought that priesthood did not dissolve
marriage contracted before orders given, yet he affirmed to that first Nicene
council, that such as were made priests before they were married, should not
afterward marry: alleging for this the ancient tradition of the church.

Chemnitius reprehendeth S. Hierome, Ambrose, Origin and Epiphanius: And
Frige^illaus Samius reprehendeth Socrates and Zomene for their report of
Paphnutius, saying Socrates added this report rashly of his own deuysing etc.
with like falsehood (says he) did he wrest the saying of Paphnutius in the
Nycene Council etc. and Zozomene (says he) following Socrates, uses his
explication in maintenance of the Doctrine of Devils, condemned by S. Paul 1.
Tim. 4.

The 2. Council of Carthage says: Cau. ^. anno 386.
it pleases all, that Bishops, Priests, Deacons etc. do abstain from wives,
to the end, that what the Apostles have taught, and antiquity observed, we
may still keep.

LVTHERS DOCTRINE.
Luther expounding the seventh chapter of the first epistle unto the Cor.
says: in Epithala mio.
It behooves us to admit (says he) that a married woman before God be
preferred before a virgin Ibid. the state of marriadge is of it own nature
spiritual, divine, heavenly, and as it were gold: but the state of single
life, is wordly, earthly, and as it were dirt or clay.

Again: Cont. Ambros. Cathar. de Caelib.
the tenth face [saith he] of Antichrist is that notable single life, and
multitude of monastical chastity, which carries an Angels face, but is a
Devilish thing.

That impure fellow Iouinian, who in time past song the same song, which
Luther does now, was therefore condemned by the primitive church, of heresy,
and reprehended by the holy fathers S Hierome and S. Augustine: Cent. 4. cap.
5. col. 381.
but the Century-writers defending Iouinian, do affirm that he was wrongfully
reprehended by them, and that S. Hierome and S. Austine were rather heretics
then their Iouinian.

Luther calls the vow of single life and chastity, in enarr Euang in die
Epiphaniae.
most wicked and impious, proceeding from the Devil, who does by such manner
of snares in tangle Christian liberty, saying, that certainly (says he) if we
will omit frivolous things, and speak what this is, we must either confess
that chastity is impossible, as other things are, that exceed our forces, and
was never vowed, or certainly there was never any Monk in the world. Ibid. O
horrible peruersitie, and for this end brought in by Satan, that he might bind
miserable souls the more strongly with the bonds of wantonness, and hold them
in that, wherein they are most weak, he did see that all other things were
easier to be observed then this, this vow of chastity, which does far exceed
all our forces, he does earnestly labor to make irreuocable, and to be exacted
most severely etc. These Luther.

CALVIN'S DOCTRINE.
lib 4 instit. cap. 12.. 23.
In one thing (says he) they are more then severe and not to be entreated, in
that they will not permit priests to marry etc this prohibition does
manifestly show, how pestiferous and wicked all traditions are, which have not
only deprived the church of honest and good pastors, but also has brought in
a horrible h^^p of wickedness, and has cast headlong many a soul into the
gulf of despair.

cap. 13.. 3.
Again: [he that voweth (says he) what is not in his own power, or does not
stand with his calling, he is rash etc. in which kind of madd boldness single
life has the first place, for sacrificers, Monks, and such as lead a
monastical life being forgetful of their infirmity, do think they can lead
a single life, but by what oracle are they taught, that they shall keep their
chastity all their life, unto which end they vow it? they here the voice of
God concerning the general condition of men. It is not good for man to be
alone, they understand, and I would to God they did not perceive, that sin
remaining in us does not want most sharp prickinges, upon what confidence dare
they for their whole life time assure themselves of that general vocation* for
as much as the gift of continency is often times granted but for a time, as
opportunity requires. In such a perverseness let them not expect God to be their
helper, but let them rather remember that which is written: thou shall not
tempt thy Lord thy God. But this is to tempt God, and to strive against that
nature which he has given us, and to despise his present gifts, as if they
did nothing perteyn unto them.] O carnal gospel?

Again:. 7.
[It is manifest with what horrible superstition in this be half, the whole
world did labor in, for many ages. one voweth that he will drink no wine, as
if the abstinence of wine were a worship of it self grateful unto God, an
other binds himself to fasting, another to abstinence from flesh etc. this
was esteemed for great wisdom, to make votiue pilgrimages to holy places, and
some time to go them on foot, or their boby half naked, thereby to obteyn the
more merit by their weariness, these and such like wherein the world did a
long time sweat in, if they were examined by those rules which we have placed
before, they will not only be found vain and foolish, but also full of
manifest impiety]

Again:. ^4. Ibi^.
the very thing it self (says he) makes it manifest, that all such as enter
into monasteries, are fallen from the church, yea look how many monasteries
there are at this day, so many congregations are there, I say of schismatikes.

Again:. 15.
therefore (says he) let the reader remember that I spoke rather of monachisme
then of the Monks themselves; and that I noted those vi es, not which are in
the lives of a few of them, but such as cannot be separated from that manner of
living.

. 17.
Again: moreover [saith he] for as much as they bind themselves to many
perverse and impious worshipings, which even to this day monachisme contains,
I say they are consecrated not to God, but to the Devil. Ibid.
They promise perpetual virginity unto God, as if they had made a covenant
before hand with God, that he should free them from the necessity of wedlock,
they cannot excuse it and say, that they do not make this vow without the
grace of God, for in as much as he says himself, that it is not given unto
all, it is our part not to have confidence of a special gift etc this [say
they] has always been observed, that those did bind themselves with the v^w
of continency, which would dedicate themselves wholly unto our Lord. I confess
indeed that this is also an ancient custom, but that, that age was free from
all error, I do not grant, or that it should be taken for a rule whatsoever
was then done

cap 1.. vlt.
Again: [as for the fathers [saith he] whose wrytings are now extant, when they
did speak it of their own judgment, they did never [except only Hierome] with
such malice detract from the honesty of wedlock.] But what their opinion is I
leave it to your own judgment by that which has been said.

An old condemned Heresy.
S. Hier. cont. Iouin. and S. August lib. de haeres cap. ^2. S. Hier. contra
vigilantium.
Iouinian held that wedlock was equal in dignity and merit to virginity: for
he taught that the reward of the blessed should be a like, also it was the
heresy of Vigilantius that Ecclesiastical men ought to marry.

THE 38. ARTICLE Vows of perpetual chastity were allowed by the fathers,
affirming them to be obligatory.
PEter Martyr says: de votis page 490.
let it be, there were then in the age of Clement, Bishop of Alexandria anno
190. professions of chastity and vows; I confess it: for even then, men began
to fly from the word of God etc.

Again: page 524.
I know [saith he] that Epiphanius with many others of the Fathers did err in
this, that they said it was a sin to violate such a vow, when there should be
need, and that they did ill in referring it to the tradition of the Apostles.

M. Parkins says: in problem. etc. page 191.
in the foresaid ages [saith he] solemn vows of continency were accustomed
to be made publicly in the church, for anno 190. Clement of Alexandria says
it etc.

Iustus Melitor says: Clement. etc 1. 3. stromat.
The Council of Calcedon did against the oracles of the holy ghost for bid the
use of wedlock to Monks, and monastical virgins.

Danaeus says: That S. Contra. Bellar. 1. pa^^is altera part page 4.
Austine and all the Fathers assembled with him in the council of Carthage
abused manifestly the word of God, saying upon the Apostles words: if any
widow how young soever etc. have vowed herself to God, left her ^all
habit, and under the testimony of the B^^hope, and church have appeared in
religious vveede, if afterward she go to seculare marriage, they shall
according to the Apostle, have damnation, because thy durst make void the vovv
of chastity, which they made to God.

M. Wotton says: well; the Fathers are not for us, what then? is nothing true
that cannot be confirmed by their testimony? etc. indeed (says he) it is one
of the blemishes of the ancient writers, that they were to highly conceited of
single life etc. therefore we must not expect that antiquity should afford us
any testimony herein against the practyse and judgment of these days.

almost all the ancient Fathers.

THE 40. ARTICLE. The Roman faith proved to be the true Catholic says by S.
Dionysius Areopagita, and Hermes, who were most ancient, and lived in the
Apostles time.
COncerning Dienysius of whom mention is made in the cap. 17.^4.
Acts of the Apostles, M. D. Humfrey says: in Iesuitis. part. 2. rat. 5. page
513. 514. and 519.
[Suid^s, Michaell Singelus, Gregorius Turonensis and others do take this
Areopagita to be the disciple of S. Paul, and author of the heavenly, or
ecclesiastical Hierarchy.]

Luther says: tom. 2. wittemberg. 1562. de captiu. Babyl. fol. 84.
[But thou will say (says Luther: what say you to Dionysius, who numbreth six
Sacraments etc. I answer (says he) I know this man only of the ancient
Fathers to stand for the number of seven Sacraments, although omitting
matrimony, he grant six only,] the same affirms M. D. Humfrey vbi supra,
etc. page 519.

M. Whitaker says: de Sacra Scriptura page 655.
I do acknowledge that Dionysius is in many places a great patron of
traditions.

M. Hooker our country man, in so much as Hamelmanus says Hamel. col. 273.

justification of works, of professed Chastity in ministers: of fasting from
certain meats etc.

Abraham Abr. Scult. in medulla Theolog etc. page 467. post med.
Scultetus says: it mainteneth free will, monastical life, and solitude, and
Purgatory, see this more at large and most perspicuous in the Protestants
Apology for the Roman Church fol. 125. 126.

THE 41. ARTICLE. To show no beginning of a Doctrine is an infallible token,
that it is, and proceeds from the Apostles.
in his defense against M. Cartwryght page 51.
M. Whitgift lord Archbishop of Canterbury does most learnedly, and truly urge
this general rule or proof of Apostolic Doctrine, saying: [for as much as
the original and beginning of these names, Metropolitan, Archbishop etc. (such
is their antiquity) cannot be found (so far as I have read) it is to be
supposed they have their original from the Apostles them selves, for as I
remember S. Austine epist. 118.
S. Austine has the same rule:] in proof of this rule he says yet further.
vbi supra page 352.
[It is of credit (says he) with the writers of our time, namely with
Zuinglius, Calvin, and Gualter, and surely I think no learned man does dissent
from them.]

M. Cartvvryght answers to this rule: Ibid.
[that thereby a window is openned to bring in all popery again, for I appeall
(says he) to the judgment of all men, if this be not to bring in Popery
again, to allow of S. Austins sayng. etc.

So evidently do our learned adversaries, and the apparent probability of this
rule (approved also and allowed by e M. D. Field) confirm and prove our fore
said Catholic religion, whereto we were so many ages since converted, to be
not new or secondary since the Apostles times, but truly primitive and
undoubtedly Apostolyke, that in whit. in resp. ad Camp rat. 7. page 101.
M. Whitaker confesses [that the times of the Roman Churches change cannot
easily be told.]

M Powell in his consideration of Papists supplication page 43.
M. Gabriell Povvell being provoked, that if our Catholic Doctrine be an
error, then to tell us when this error came in, and who was the Author of it
etc. answers: [Wee cannot tell by whom, or at what time the enemy did sow it
etc. Neither indeed do we know who was the first author of every one of your
blasphemous opinions etc.

In libro Apologetico etc. page 192. 193.
[Ioannes Regius being likwyse urged to show wherein the Roman Church has
changed her faith, and not able to give any one particular example thereof, he
be takes him self to this extreme boldness answering: [But last of all (says
he) if it were true that the Roman Church had never changed any thing in her
religion, shall it therefore presently follow, it is the true Church?

Out of all which is necessarily deduced, that according to M. Whitgiftes
foresaid rule, and assertion whatsoever opynion is not known to have begun
since the Apostles time, the same is not new or secondary, but received it is
original from the Apostles them selves, as ours (The Roman religion) has
been proved to have done.

THE 42. ARTICLE. True Miracles make a strong argument for the true faith: and
that the fore said faith whereunto the English were converted, was confirmed
by such miracles.
AS in the nonage, or infancy of the Church, our Savior did make manifest the
truth of his Apostles Doctrine by undoubted miracles to serve as signs of
their Apostleship, 2. Cor. 12.12. Marc. c. 16. v. 20.
and to that end confirmed the word with signs following it, so likewise this
virtue or power of Miracles did not cease, but as our Adversaries confess)
always shine in the Church, the necessity thereof being one and the same in all
succeeding ages to the conversion of the heathen, contemning the Scriptures,
are nothing moved with the miracles therein mentioned.

Whereas our Savior says: John. 14. v. 12.
He that belieueth in me, the works that I do shall he do and greater. In
the marginall notes of the English bible printed anno 1576. it is there upon
said: This is referred to the whole body of the Church in whom this virtue
does shine for ever; therefore they are not now to cease as some. Protestants
affirm.

S. Irenaeus and S. Austine say: S. Irenaeus lib 2. c. 18. S. Austine de
ciuitate Do^ lib. 22. cap. 1.
Why (say they) are not those miracles, which you preach to have been done, now
done, certainly I might say they were necessary before the world did believe,
for this end, that the world might believe: And a little after, now also they
are done in his name.

Miracles are through out the whole course of Scriptures both acknowledged and
urged: Acknowledged in Exodus 8, 19, and 3, of kings 17, 24, and cap. 18, 19,
and 4, of kings 5, 15, Matthew. 14, 25, 33, and cap. 27, 54, John. 2, 23, and 3,
2, and 4, 53, and 9, 30, and 11, 45, Act. 4, 14, 16, and 9, 35, Urged. Exodus
7, 17, and 16, 12, Number. 16, 28, Iosue 10, 16, and 3, of kings 13, 3, 5, and
18, 24, 38, and 20, 23, 28, and 4, of kings 20, 8, 9, 10, Matthew. 9, 6, Marcke.
2, 10, John. 14, 11, and 15, 14, and 20, 30, 31. Yea Miracles were to our a
Savior himself a greater testimony then S. John 25. v. 36.
John Baptist.

In Comm. Catech. page 21.
To answer the objection of false miracles Vrsinus says: Those miracles
whereof the enemies of the Church boast, are such as (not changing the order of
nature) may be done by the deceates of men or Devils etc. But the miracles
where with God has adorned his Church, are works either beside or against the
order of nature, and secundary causes, and therefore they are not done but by
divine power.

miracles, he was baptized, the same says Holin^head vbi supra.

M. Fox says: They were in those times so certainly known, that as S. Bid
reports, it was written in the Epitaph upon his tomb, that he was assisted
by God in doing of miracles: See the same in Stowes Chronocle dedicated to the
lord Archbishop of Canterbury printed 1592. page 66.

Gregorius l. 7. epist. 30. I^dict, 1.
S. Gregory himself reports to Eulogious Archbishop of Alexandria saying: know
then, that where as the English nation etc. remained hitherto in infidelity, I
did by the help of your prayers etc. send unto that nation Austins a Monk of
my Monastery, to preach to them etc. and now letters are come to us, both of
his health and of his work that he has in hand: and surely either he, or they
that were sent over with him, work so many miracles in that land, as they may
seem therein to imitate the power and miracles of the Apostles them selves.

Also he does specially write unto S. Austine touching miracles done by him,
aduising him not to glory in them; but rather to consider that God gave him
that gift for the weal, and good of those unto whom he was sent etc.

This letter of Gregory's is exstant in S. Bid and mentioned by Holinshead vbi
supra: in so much that M. Fox and M. Godvvin (both learned Protestants* do
also mention and acknowledge the miracles then wrought by Austine through Gods
hand.

Also S. Bid, M. Fox and Holinshead do make special mention of the
miraculous conversion of Edvvin king of the worthumbers which happenned some six
and twenty years after Austines foresaid coming into England, which M. Fox
doubts not to place in his Catalogue of true miracles.

As concerning the miracles of Malachias, Archbishop of Ireland and the Popes
Legate, no meaner a witness then S. Bernard, (his very familiare friend) says
of them in general: In what kind of old miracles (says he) did not Malachias
excel? he wanted not Prophecy, not revelation, not the gift of healinge, and
to conclude, not raising of the Dead. This is also mentioned and acknowledged
by the Centuristes.

In the book entitled: A report of the kingdom of Congo a region of Afric,
printed anno 1597. by M. Abraham Hartvvell servant to the lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, and by him dedicated to his lord: l. 1. c. 1.
mention is made of the discovery of that kingdom anno 1587. by Odoardo Lopaz,
and of the conversion thereof to the Christian faith, l. 2. c. 2.
and of the great and undoubted miracles showed by God in the presence of a
whole army. c. 3.
In so much that M. Hartvvell in his epistle there to the reader about the
midest, confesses that this conversion of Congo was accomplished (by massing
priests) and after the Romish manner; and this action (says he) which tends
to the honor of God, shall it be concealed and not committed to memory,
because it was performed by Popish priests and Popish means? God forbid. In
like manner M. John Pory, Lately of Goneuill and Catus College in Cambridg, in
the Geographicall History of Africa by him published anno 1600. acknowldegeth
and mentions the said miracles, page 410.
and commends M. Hartvvell for publishing his foresaid treatise.

page 413. Rerum in Orient gestinarum commentarius fol. 2. anno 15 41. page 6.
dated in April 15. 56.
Also it appears in a book entitled as in the margent, That Franciscus
Xauerius a Jesuit, set for ward in his journey from Lysbone to the East India,
for the conversion of that nation: and that the king of Portugal hearing of
the great miracles that were by them there wrought, sent forth his commission
to his Viceroy there, to take examination thereof upon oath, upon execution
whereof and certificate there upon accordingly made, it did appear that
Zauerius in testimony and proof of the Christian faith by him then preached
and tought, fol. 8.
cured miraculously the dumb, the lame, the deaf, and with his word healed
the sick, fol. 9.
and raised sundry dead persons to life: and after his death the grave being
ope^ned where in his dead body for a time had lame buried, fol 14. anno 1552.
to the end his naked bones might be carried from thence to Goa, they found his
body not only unconsumed, but also yielding forth fragrant smells: from whence
they carried it to Goa, and placed it there in the Church of S. Paul, where yet
to this day (says the co^mentary) it remains free from corruption: witness
whereof (says that treatise) are all the in habitantes of that City, and
trauaylers that repair thither the truth hereof for matter of fact, is so
probable, that M. Whitaker dare not in his answer there to, altogether rest in
denial of it, lib. de Ecclesia contra Bellarmine page 35^. page 354.
but says: let not Bellarmine think, that I do altogether contemn these
miracles. I answer it may be that there have been such miracles in the Popish
government, and perchance now there are; the Devil might (says he) preserve
for a time the body of Xauerius vncorrupt, and yielding forth sweet smells.

Here he does not so much deny these miracles, as over bouldly refer them to
the work of the Devil. Whereas yet to the contrary M. Richard Hackluite
preacher, in his book of principal Nauigations etc. printed anno 1599. In the
2. part. of the 2. vol. page 88. i^iti^
doubts not to afford commendable mention of that holy man Xauerius his
particular virtues and wonderful works in that religion. These few may
suffice in this place, see more at large, and with full answer to all
objections in the Eleventh note of the Church translated out of Card. Bellarm.

THE 43. ARTICLE. Our Adversaries opposing Fathers against Fathers ansvveared.
NOw to answer our Adversaries last shift, and which they often use, in
alleging Fathers against Fathers, yea and the same father against himself,
where upon occasion offered, they speak something more obscure, especially if
there be not had due consideration of all circumstances inducing them there
unto. I answer it is no marueil if they so handle the Fathers, so much against
them, when they spare not their own, and chief Doctors, in making them say
what they list for their purpose. Witness Luther, who says: What shall I say?
In praefat. in Smalcaldico^ articulos extant in Luke Osiander epitome cent 16.
page 253. and 254.
how shall I complain? as yet I live, I write, preach and teach publicly and
daily, and yet there are envious men, not only of our adversaries, but also
false brethren, which say they agree with us, and yet dare bring, and bouldly
allege my own writings and Doctrine again my self, I yet live, seeing and
hearing it, although they know that I teach other wise, and do not stick to
adorn their poison with my labor etc. what then will they do after my death
etc. certainly I must answer to althinges whilst I yet live etc.

Gerhardus G^eschenius s says: they endeavor to make the Augustan confession
(which teaches the real presence) to be Zuinglian, that is; against the real
presence, wherefore exclayming he says further if this had been done in Arabia,
Armenia, Sardinia, or such like remote countries, and of former times, this
usurpation of fraud and Historical falsehood were more tolerable. But seeing
(say they) the question is of such things as are done in our own times, and
in the sight of all men, who with a quiet mind can endure such lies? This may
suffice to show our Adversaries corruption, in detorting unto a wrong sense the
obscure places of the Fathers; But let us as well in reading them, as the holy
Scriptures or such like writings follow the advice of S. Chrysostom, who
exhorting the more learned sort to the reading of holy Scriptures, which other
wise were very much given to idle plays and gameing, says: Take the book into
thy hand, Homil. 3. de Lazaro.
read the whole history, and those things which are easy keep in memory, and
which are obscure and not manifest, read often; And if thou can not by
diligence in reading, understand what is said, approach unto the wyser, go unto
the Doctor.

the advice of Beza is not to be misliked, who in his answer to na objection
out of Calvin says: places of one and the same writer ought often times to be
compared together, that it may plainly beseem what was his meaning and
opynion, because all things cannot nor ought not to be spoken in all places
although it be of one and the same thing.

THE 44. ARTICLE. Our Adversaries general abiuring the Fathers, and condemning
their Doctrine.

M. D Humf^e) did earnestly reprehend M. Iuell, for his so bold appealing to
the Fathers, affirming therefore of Jewel, that herin he gave the Papists to
large a scope, was injurious to himself, and after a manner spoiled himself and
the Church: the same also says M. Fulk.

Iacobus ^scontius a learned Protestant says of Protestants alleging the
Fathers, that some have gone so far, as they have even filled all things
again with the Fathers, and their authorities, which I would to God (says he)
they had done with as good success, as they began it with good hope etc.
certainly I think this custom most pernicious and by all means to be avoided,
etc.

Luther says: tom. ^. wittember. anno 1551. lib. de seruo arbitrio page 434.

The Fathers of so many ages have been plainly blind, and most ignorant in the
Scriptures, and have erred (says he) all their life time, so that unless they
were amended before their death, they were neither Saints (says he) nor
perteyning to the Church

Pomeran a learned Protestant says: Our Forefathers, whether holy or not holy
I care not, were all blinded with a Montanicall spirit by humane traditions and
Doctrine of Devils etc. Beza in his praef. upon the new test. dedicat. to the
prince of Condy anno 1587.
they do not (says he) teach purely justification etc. neither were they
indeed careful to teach Jesus Christ truly in their gospel.

Beza affirms: that even in the best times, the ambition, ignorance and
leudnes of Bishops was such, that the very blind may easily preceaue, how that
Satan was present, and did sit over their assembles and Counsels.

M. Cartwright says: That diverse of the most ancient, and chiefest of them
fondly imagined of Antichrist as of one singular person.

Peter Martyr reproves the Fathers in general saying: The Fathers should not
with so much liberty have seemed here and there, so to abuse the name (Altar)

Calvin with: The ancient writers cannot be excused, for as much as it is
manifest that they have declined from the pure, and true institution of Christ.

Bellarmine alleging the Greek and Latin Fathers in proof of Lymbus Patrum,
Danaeus answering him says: As for them they were not instructed out of the
word of God.

M. Whitaker against Duraeus says: what thou can not overcome by Scripture,
thou will with out doubt effect by the testimonies of Fathers etc. Therefore you
shall not expect, that I do in particular confute these their errors.

The Century-vvriters and Abraham Scultetus say: That Clement did every where
affirm free will, and that it appears, that not only all the Doctors of
that age were in this manner of blindness; but also that it grew a among
pastors etc. And that the most ancient Fathers, Cyprian, Theophilus,
Tertullian, Origin, Clemens Alexandr. Iustine, Irenaeus, etc. erred in this
point.

Luther calls S. Hierome, Ambrose, Augustine and others, Iustice-workers of
the old Papistry, or Papacy.

Of certain Fathers in particular.
Petrus Alexandrinus.
Peter Martyr reproves him saying: Petrus Alexandr. In his comm places in

attributheth more to the outward Altar, then to the lively temples of Christ.

Optatus.
Peter says: where Optatus against Permenianus says: vbi supra
What is the Altar? even the seat of the body and blood of Christ. Cent 4 c. 6
col. 409. line 25
But such sayings as these (says Peter Martyr) edified not the People: the
same say they Century-vvriters.

S. Ignatius.
M. Cartwright says: In his 2. reply vlt part. part. 264. M wotton in his
def. of M Parkins etc page ^39 349.
Ignatius calls the communion table improperly, an Altar.

M. Wotton says: I say plainly (says he) this man's testimony is nothing
worth, because he was of little judgment in Divinity.

S. Ambrose.
M. Fulke says: That Ambrose, M. Fulk in his confut of Purgat. page 320. 325.
allowed prayer for the dead, and that it was the common error of his time.

S. Augustine.
M. Fulke says: Augustine blindly defended it. vbi supra Chem examen part. 3.

Chemnitius says: These Austine does without the Scripture, yielding to time
and custom.

Musculus says: Austine did inconsiderately affirm the Sacraments of the new
testament to give salvation.

Iustine Martyr.

Chrysostom.

Century-vvriters say: Chrysostom handles impurely the Doctrine of
Justification, and attributes merit to works.

Luther against Certain in particular.
tom 2. wittemberg. lib. lib de seruo arbitrio printed 1603 page 72 7^. 275. and
3^7. Al^o in Collo (...) mensalib^^ cap. de Patribus Ecclesiae.
In the writings of Hierome (says he) there is not a word of true faith in
Christ and sound religion. Tertullian in very superstitious. I have holden
Origin long since occursed. Of Chrysostom I make no accounte. Basil is of no
worth, he is wholly a Monk, I way him not of a hair. Cyprian is a weak Deuyne
etc. affirming there yet further, that the whole Church did degenerate in the
Apostles time; And that the Apology of Phillippe Melanchthon does far excel
all the Doctors of the Church, yea even Austine himself. These Luther.

in his de^. of M Parkins etc. page 491.
To conclude M Wotton says: But the Fathers are not for us, what then? is
nothing true that cannot be confirmed by their testimony etc.

But to say that the true Church immediately after the Apostles times became
adulterous and corrupt (which the most with Luther a boue said, affirm) it
most absurd, first because the visible true Church was no more then made
heretical, or corrupt by the Churches revolted Children in those days, then
Luthers like late dispersed Doctrine makes our now Church to be Lutheran.
Secundly if other wise the Church so presently after the Apostles times ceased
to be a virgin, and so became adulterous and corrupt, who sees not then the
blasphemy thence ensuing? for in what one age from the Apostles times to this
present, may the Church then be thought to be preserved chaste? Thirdly it is
against manifest Scripture as in the tract where the Church cannot err see
more at large.

Wherefore once more to conclude this controversy, receive this one sentence
from that weak deuyne (according to Luther) S. Cyprian, in which you may at
least see the opinyon of the Church in his days: Lib. de veritate Ecclesiae.
The spouse of Christ (says he) cannot be adulterated, she is vncorrupt and
Chaste etc.

By these you may in part understand what esteem is made of those first
Doctors, and prelates of Gods Church, though (in the tract where they appeal to
the Fathers, and in that where the Church cannot err) freely confessed to be
most holy, learned, and deuynely inspired, such is the malapert obstinacy, and
blind ignorance of heresy, that when it has, as to the most infallible
interpreter and Doctor of our Saviors will, made appeall, and find it thus
plain and absolute, that it will by no means bear any colorable gloss,
then, I say, it does thus impudently reject it, with all opprobrious speeches
and blasphemous sentences.

THE 45. ARTICLE. The Continual purity of the Roman Church acknowledged by
our Adversaries.
M. D. lib de Antichristo cont. Sanderum page 5. M. Fulke in his confutat. of
Whitaker acknowledges no change in the Roman Church for the first six
hundredth years after Christ.

M. Fulk says: The Church of Rome retained by succession until Tertullian
days (viz anno 200.) that faith which it did first receive from the Apostles:
Purgatory page 174. Zanchius de vera religione page 148.
The same affirms Hierome Zanchius a Protestant.

And where one of our Catholic writers urges the succession of the Roman
Bishops according to the example of Irenaeus, M. Fulk vbi supra page 372. 373.
Cyprian, Tertullian, Optatus, Hierome, Austine, and Vincentius Lyrinensis, M.
Fulke says: the reason why these men specially named the Church of Rome, was,
because the Church of Rome at that time, as it was founded by the Apostles, so
it continued in the Doctrine of the Apostles.

In his conference which M Heart. page 443.
M. D. Reynolds being provoked in the same kind acknowledges in like manner
that the succession of the Roman Bishops was a proof of the true Church and
faith, in the time of Augustine, Epiphamus, Optatus, Tertullian, Irenaeus, etc.

In his retent etc. page 85
M. Fulk says yet further: The Popish Church is but an heretical assembly,
departed from the universal Church of Christ long since Austines departure
out of this life, to wit, long after they year 400. wherein S. Austine lived.

In his reply to M. Harding page 246.
M. Jewel says: That as well S. Austine as all other holy Fathers did well in
yielding reverence to the Sea of Rome etc. for the purity of religion which was
there preserved a long time with out spot.

Instit. l. 4. c. ^. s^.
This matter being so freely confessed, we will conclude with Calvin who says
of us: they indeed set forth their Churches very gloriously etc. they report
out of Irenaeus, sect. 3.
Tertullian, Origin, Augustine and others, how highly they esteemed this
succession: Considering (says he) it was a matter out of all doubt, that from
the beginnig, even until that time nothing was changed in doctrine, the
(foresaid) holy Doctors took in argument that which was sufficient, for the
over throwing of all new errors, to wit, In his institutions in french
printed at Geneua by Conradus ^adius anno 2562.
that they [viz. heretickes] oppugned the doctrine which even from the very
Apostles themselves had bine inviolable, and with one consent retained.

Again: It was a thing notorious [saith he] and with out doubt, that after the
Apostles age until those forsaid times, no chaung was made ^n Doctrine,
neither in Rome nor many other cities: So plainly do our learned adversaries
confess that no cha^g of faith was made by the Roman church from the Apostles
age unto the times after S. Austine etc. being (as I said) 400. years after
Christ.

To prove, that to charge heretics with the succession of Roman Bishops,
meintayning always one and the same faith, was the practice and custom of
those ancient Fathers, is a labor saved, being already so liberally
confessed, but for better satisfaction, receive this one saying of S. Hierome,
in Apolog. 2 Adu. Ruffinum.
demanding of Ruffinus saying: how does he call his faith? that which the
Roman church teaches? if he answer the Roman, then we are Catholics.

The church being thus acknowledged to have continued the first 400. years
after Christ in all purity, it shall be easy to prove that from thence unto the
six hundredth year (the time when the Roman church should fall) the same
doctrine was likewise continued, and so received by Gregory the first, then
Pope of Rome, and by him brought and received by us, and unto this day still
retained. This, I say, is made evident by our learned adversaries, having
already confessed that sundry, even of the chiefest articles of our faith, as
the Reale presence, sacrifice, freewill etc. as is already in particular
handled, so to conclude, where as they say, the church of Rome fell, but they
cannot tell when, is very absurd, when as yet there was never any other heresy,
or memorable act whatsoever, either ecclesiastical or temporal, but they ca^
decypher all circumstances, as the dissent of the Greek church from the Roman,
but not the Roman from the primitive.

Vincentius Lyrinensis says: l. Aduer. haer. cap. 34.
certainly there was never yet any heresy, but it was known to be gine under
some certain name, in a certain place, and at a certain time, in his consider.
of Papists supplications page 43.
But for the Roman Catholic religion now professed, M. Powell says he cannot
tell by whom, or at what time the enemy did sow it.

M. D. Baro. says: I dare not deny the name of Christians to the Romanists,
since the more learned w^yter do acknowledge the church of Rome to be the church
of God.

M. Hooker says* The church of Rome is to be reputed a part of the h^wse of
God, a lymne of the visible church of Christ. Yea we gladly acknowledge them
to be of the family of Jesus Christ.

M Bunny likewise says of Catholics and protestants: neither of us (says
he) may justly account the other to be none of the church of God, yea we are
no several church from them, nor they from us.

M D. Some in his defense against M. Pen^y the Puritan, and ref^tation of many
absurdities etc. in M P^n^ treatise says: The Papists are not altogether
aliens from Gods covenant, as I have showed before: for in the judgment of all
learned men, and all ^e^ormed churches, there is in Popery a church, a
ministry, a true Christ etc. if you think (says he) that all the Popish
sort, which died in the Popish church, are damned, you think absurdly, and
dissent from the judgment of the learned protestants.

M. D. Field says: we doubt not but the church, M. D Field de Eccles. lib 3.
cap. 46. line and page 182.
wherein the Bishop of Rome with more then Lucifer like pride exalted himself,
was notwithstanding the true church of Christ; that it held a saving profession
of the truth in Christ, and by force or virtue thereof, did convert many from
error etc.

Thomas Morton affirms in express words that Papists are to be accounted
of the church of God, because (says he) they hold the foundation of ths
gospel, which is faith in Christ Jesus the son of God and Savior of the
world.

Peter Martyr desired at the conference had at Poysy between the Catholics
and the protestants, that they should not for diversity of opinion break
brotherly charity, or call one the other heretics.

Lastly M. D. Couell in his defense of M. Hookers five books of
Ecclesiastical Policy, published by authority and dedicated to the Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, defends this opinion at large and concludes
saying: we affirm that they of the church of Rome are a part of the church of
Christ, and that such as live and dye in that church, may not withstanding be
saved, page 61.
In so much as he doubts not to charge the Puritans with ignorance for their
contrary opinion.

THE 47. ARTICLE A testimony from the enemy is of greatest account.
FOr as much as our learned adversaries do affirm, that it is a great piece of
work to convince the adversary from himself, for a more full satisfaction, we
think it not a miss to make use of this argument also.

M. D. Field therefore says: The next note whereby Bellarmine endeauoreth to

confession: Surely if he can prove that we confess it to be the church, he
needs not use any other arguments.

M. D. Whitaker says: the argument must needs bestrong, which is taken from

the truth inforceth testimony from her enemies.

S. Austine says: That truth is more forceable to wring out confession then any
rack, or torment.

Peter Martyr says: doubtless among all testimonies, that testimony is of
greatest account, which is testified by the enemies.

Here, you see, that to thend there be no means left unsought, whereby to make
this our so weighty a case clear, Deuteronomy. 32.31. Esaias 19.2.3. Esdras ca. 4.41.

equal with the best of them, in any of the excellent graces of Gods spirit etc.

M. Whitgift Archbishop of Canterbury in his defense and brief comparison of
the protestant Bishops of our time, with the Bishops of the primitive church
faith: page 472
The Doctrine taught and professed by our Bishops at this day, is much more
perfect and sound, then commonly it was in any age after the Apostles times.

Again: page 473.
surely (says he) you are not able to recko^ in any age, since the Apostles
time, any company of Bishops, that caught and held so perfect and sound a
doctrine in all points, as the Bishops of England do at this day etc. And in
the truth of doctrine, our Bishops be not only comparable with the old Bishops,
but in many degrees to be preferred before them.

Beza says: I have been accustomed to say, in epist. Theolog. epist. 1, page 5,
and not without cause (as I take it) that whylest I compare those very times
next unto the Apostles, with our times, they had the^ more conscience, and
less knowledge, and on the other side, we have now more knowledge and less
conscience; in praefat. in nou. test. dicat. principi Condicu^.
This is my opinion (says he) etc. In so much as he affirms that Calvin did
far exceed all the ancient, and later writers, in interpreting the scriptures
with variety of words and alleging of reasons.

and sober protestants [to use their own wordes] doubt not, but that the
primitive church, received from the Apostles, and Apostolical men, not only
the text of scripture, but also the right, and true sense thereof. And that:
we are greatly confirmed in the true and sound sense of scripture by the
testimony of the ancient church.

Imprimis, Luther.
tom 5. ad Gal. cap. 1. fol 299.
MArtin Luther having a scholar to dispute against his adversaries, in this
manner did encourage him: The argument (says he) of the Papists me thinks is
very probable and strong: that is, the church did thus think and teach it, so
many years: all the Doctors of the primitive church, most holy men, did also
judge it to be thus and so taught it, what art thou (says he) that dare
disagree from all these?

But afterward hear Luther himself against these: when Satan (says he) does
urge this matter, confidently say; whether Cyprian, Augustine, Ambrose, or S.
Peter, Paul, John, yea an Angel from heaven teach otherwise, not withstanding
this I know for certain that I do not persuade humane, but deuyne thinks, for
this I may speak with confidence, let therbe the church with Austine and other
Doctors, also S. Peter, Paul, John, yea an Angel from heaven which does teach
a contrary, not withstanding my doctrine is such that it does illustrate the
glory of God only, Peter was chief of the Apostles, and taught with out the
word of God. These Luther.

Again: where he bids adieu to all fathers, lib. de f^^ 1^ arbitrio.
counsels, deuines, Schools, Bishops, the consent of all ages, and Christian
people, says in this manner: we receive all scripture (says he) but so that
the authority of interpreting it be in our power, what we interpret, the holy
ghost does teach, what others do bring, although they be great, although they
be many, it coms from the spirit of the Devil and a wicked mind.

Again: Luther perceauing that place of S. Paul: Romans ^.
we think a man to be justified by faith, and not by the works of the
law; not sufficient to prove justification by faith, did add this particle
[only] and when he was admonished of it, thus he answered: tom. 5. fol 141. and
144.
so I will, so I command it, let my will stand for a reason etc. Luther will
have it so, and says he is a Doctor above all Doctors.

And a little after he concludes: moreover [saith he] this word [only] ought
to remain in my testament, although all Papists run made at it, and it
greeueth me [saith he] that I have not added, these twoe words [without all
works and lawes]

Again: in his book against king Henry 8. he speaks thus: The word of God
[saith he] is above althinges; the deuyne majesty makes for me, so that I
nothing care if there be a thousand Austines, a thousand Cyprians and a
thousand Henry's against me: If I am no Prophet [saith he] yet I am sure the
word of God does stand for me, I have scripture for me, and they have only
their own authority.

Again: lib. ad Ducem Georgium.
since the Apostles times [saith he] no Doctor, or writer has so excellently
and clearlie confirmed, instructed, and conforted the consciences of the
secular states as I have done, by the singular grace of God, this certeynlie I
know that neither Austine, nor Ambrose, who are yet in this manner the best,
are equal to me herein.

Aduersus ^also nomi^atum Ecclesiasticum statutum.
Again: I would you should know [saith he] that hereafter I will vouchsaue you

by it, both you and the Angels.

Andraeas Musculus says: since the Apostles times there lived not in the world
agreater the^ Luther. And it may welbe said [saith he] that God has powered out
all his gifts upon this only man, and that there is as great difference
between the ancient Doctors and Luther, as between the light of the sun
and the moon, neither is it to be doubted [saith he] but that the ancient
Fathers, even those that were chief and best among them as Hilary and Austine,
if they had lived, and taught in the same time with Luther, they would without
blushing have carried [as his ministers] the lantern before him.

The examples that might be further given of this kind are almost infinite, in
so much as sundry Caluinists blushing there at in Luthers behalf, have not for
borne to tax him with excessive pride, as lib. Germanico contra Hosium de
coena Domini p. 82.
Conradus Reis says of him: God [saith he] has for the sin of pride, where
with Luther extolled himself [as many of his writings shew] taken from him his
true spirit etc. and in place thereof, has given him an angry, proud, and
lying spirit.

The deuines of Tigurt say: in confess. Germanica prinred. Tiguri 1544. in
octauo.
Luther boasts himself to be the Apostle, and Prophet of the Germans, and
that he learned of none, and of whom all others have learned, no man has
known any thing, but all have learned of Luther, no man has done any thing,
Luther has done all etc.

in Praefat. in libro contra Regem Angl. extant
To conclude with Luthers civility to wards king Henry the eight, he calls
him: an envious madd fool, babbling with much spittle in his mouth, more
furious then madness it self, more doltish then folly it self, endued with an
impudent and whorish face, In tom 2. wittemberg. fol. 333. 334. 335. etc.
without any one vein of princely blood in his body, a lying sophist a
damnable rotten worm, a basiliste and progeny of an adder, a lying scurrill
covered with the title of a king, a clownish wit, a doltish head, most
wicked, foolish and impudent Henry, fol. 338 fol. 240. and 333. etc.
he does not only lie like a most vain scurie, but surpasses a most wicked
knave: thou lie in thy throat most foolish and sacrilegious king. These are
his very words, with much more which modesty, will not repeat.

Calvin.
John Calvin does fear neither the name of counsels, Bishops, or Pastors.
lib. 4 instit. c. 6 11 12. lib. 3. cap. 5. 11. 20.


Also [saith he] when they object to me; this has been received thirteen
hundred years since (to wit; prayer for the Dead) I answer them, those
Fathers in this thing, wanted both the law of God and good example; finally
they fell into a horrible error. cap 4. 11. ^2.
Also it does little move me (says he) whatsoever does occur every where in
the writings of the Fathers concerning satisfaction. It is true, I see many of
them, yea [saith he] I will speak plainly all most, all whose books are now
extant, have either failed in this point, or else have spoken to sharply and
harsh. Also [saith he] if they be Apostles let them not prattle whatsoever
pleases them, lib. 4 cap. 1. 11. 4.
but let them teach seriously and truly his commandments by whom they are
sent.

Again: cap 17.. 15.
Thus he proves his exposition of these words: This is my body, we [saith
he] as in all the whole scripture besides, do study to know the true sense of
this place with no less obedience then care; neither do we rashly admit with
a preposterous feruor or in consideration, what first does come into our
minds, but with earnest meditation we do embrace that sense, which the
spirit of God does suggest.

Zuinglius.
tom. 1. lib. de certitudine and claritate verbi Dei fol. 168.
If thou crave a judge (says he) to determine of the word of God etc. every man
may err unless he be illuminated by the holy ghost but if a man cannot be a
certain judge unless God illuminate him, what does hinder me that I go not
to this teacher and master, who may illuminate me, with the light of his holy
spirit? But thou will say, by what sign, do thou show thy self to be taught
of God? I know it, I say, and certainly know it, first because whatsoever you
shall ask and believe it shall be given you: Matthew. 21.
an other sign also there is whereby I know my self to be taught by the holy
ghost, to wit; that I perceive this truth of God to be within me, be it spoken
(says he) without envy.

in expositione articuli 44.
Again: The Catholics (says he) do affirm the sacrifice of the mass, but
who shall be judge? I say only (quoth he) the word of God, and thou by and by
do cry out, the Fathers, the Fathers have so taught us, but I bring thee
neither Fathers nor mothers, wherefore I crave the word of God. These he.

Musculus.
in locis communibus ca. de iustificatione numero 5. a 2. cor. cap. 12. v. 11.
The Papists (says he) do object the epistle of S. James; but he whosoever
he were, although the brother of Christ, and Pillar amongst the Apostles, and
as S. Paul says a great Apostle a boue measure, not withstanding (says he) he
should not prejudice the verity of justification by faith only.

Fricius (of all the protestants in Polonia without question the most
learned) against communion under one form.
Christ (says he) in the last supper joined drink with the meat, therefore if
the church separate these, Modreuius l. 2. de ecclesia c. 2. page 411.
she is not to be heard: let it be, that the church of Jerusalem has
separated these, and that S. James [which certainly they do affirme] has given
but one only form to them of Jerusalem, what then? the word of God is clear
and plain; eat ye, and drink ye: this we must here this is to be
preferred before all Jacobs and all words of the church, no otherwise then God
is preferred before the church.

Brentius.
Brentius also does most evidently affirm the same, in Apolog. confess wittem.
c. de concilijs Page 600.
according to the sentence and decree of the whole church of wittem both S.
Peter [saith he] prince of the Apostles and S. Barnabus, after they had
received the holy ghost, did err to gether with the church of Jerusalem.

THE 50. ARTICLE. Heretics Raylinges, the one against the other.
Luther against the Zuinglius.
Contra articulos Louan. These. 27.
We undoubtedly judge (says he) the Zuinglians to be Heretics, and
altogether alienated from the church of God, who deny the body and blood of
Christ to be received with our carnal mouth in the blessed Sacrament.

Luther against the Caluinistes.
Cont Call. tom. ^. Iene^si page 299. Conrad. Schlusselbur. de Theolog. Call. lib
2. page 42. vide ibi exempla fol. ^. etc.
Luther says that in favor of these later Arians, Calvin has called in
question and plainly rejected all, or most part of those sayings and
wrytinges, whereby the Fathers have proved, out of the Bible the divinity of
Jesus Christ, and confuted all such heretics, whereof therbe many examples in
D. Ioannis Matthai libro, which he set forth against the infection of the
Caluinistes.

Luther against the Sacramentaries or Zuinglius.
in confess. orthodox.
The Deuynes of Tigur. allege Luthers confession, made a little before his
death where he says: I, that walk now to my grave, Eccles. Tigur tract. 3.
fol. 108.
will carry this testimony and glory to the tribunal seat of Christ my
Savior, that I have, with all carefullnes condemned and avoided those
fanaticall men and enemies of the Sacrament, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius,
Suenkfeldius, and their Scholars; whether they be at zurick, or in what other
place soever under the sun.

Tilmannus Heshusius a Lutheran against Calvin.
I do protest (says he) in defens. cont. Call.
both to God and the church that I have not Joined hands with that blasphemous
and wicked sect of the Caluinistes but have resisted them to their face, and
given all diligent labor in the work of the son of God.

Luther against the Zuinglians.
I protest says he, before God, and the world, tom. 7. wittemberg. fol. ^81.
and 382.
that I do not agree with them, nor ever will whilst the world stands, but
will have my hand clear from the blood of those sheep, which these heretics
drive from Christ, deceive and kill yea cursed be the charity and concord of
Sacramentaries for ever and ever to all eternity.

The Deuynes of Mansfield Lutherans against Caluinistes.
We do justly suspect (say they) the Doctrine of the Sacramentaries: in
confess. Mansfield. Latina page 120.
first for their new beginning, for it has had it is beginning now of late in
our time, and was altogether unknown to the old church; Secondly because the
Sacramentaries do not absolutely agree among themselves in one opinion, but are
divided, so that some are Carolastadians, Zuinglians, Oecolampadians,
Zuenkfieldians, Campanistes, Caluinistes and such like.

Epitome colloquij maulbranae anno 1564. page 82.
The Lutherans, in a notable Synod in Germany with one voice, and general
consent, do plainly renounce all brotherly friendship with the Zuinglians in
these words.
That the Zuinglians do write themselves to be acknowledged for our brethren,
this is so impudent and foolish a thing feigned by them, that we cannot
sufficiently admire their saucines. But as we grant them no part in the
church, so likewise do we not acknowledge them for our brethren, who we
know to be puffed up with the spirit of lying, and very contumelious against
the son of God.

A superintendent of the Lutherans against Zuinglians for corrupting the Bible.
conra^us Schlus^^^bur de (...) lib 2. and fol. 43. and 44.
Zuinglius [saith he] that he might prove his Sacramentarie blasphemy, most
wickedly like a manifest falsifier and forger of scripture, has corrupted the
word of the son of the liueing God, neither can this wickedness of Zuinglius,
under any color be excused, for the thing is most manifest: Moreover both the
Greek text, all latin translations, and also the Tigurian translation,
together with Luther, has, This is my body; for which Zuinglius has put. This
signifies my body. Concerning the German translation made by the same
Zuinglius, thus it is; anno 1560.
one Humbert a Rector of a School in the town of Mundera in Saxionie showed me
an example of a Germane Bible which was printed at Tigur. where, with great
admiration and vexation of mind, I found the word of the son of God corrupted
according to the fancy of that dreaming Zuinglius: for in all these four
places: Matthew. 26. Mark. 14. Luke 22. and 1. Cor. 11. where the words of the
institution of the son of God are rehearsed: This is my body. This is my blood,
he has falsified the text saying, This signifies my body; This signifies my
blood.

A special great Lutheran against the Caluinistes.
A certain great Lutheran Patriarch did set forth thee books against
Caluinistes, Capita libri primi; tres libri Caluinistarum Theologiae.
printed at Franckford with this title anno Domini 1591. In which as it were in
a certain table, is plainly made manifest out of more then 223. public
writings of the Sacramentaries, as also by their own words, together with
the names of the authors, that they hold no one article of the Christian
Doctrine, right as they ought to do, who beginning from God and his
omnipotency and word, running over almost all other articles, as of the union
of the twoe persons in Christ, the redemption, the holy ghost, the Fall of man,
of Free will, of the law of God, of the gospel of predestination, of the
article of justification, of faith only justifying, of good works, of
pennaunce, of the Sacraments in general of Baptism, of the Lords supper etc.
of the Ascension of Christ into heaven, of his descension into hell, of the
worship of Christ; and in all these and many other this Patriarch does condemn
the faith of the Caluinistes as altogether heretical, and does scarce name
them [which he does very often] but he does adorn them with some singular
Epithet or other, calling them infidles, wicked, blasphemous, louglers,
heretics, incredulous, stricken with the spirit of madness and blindness, men
of an impudent and shameless countenance, the trouble some instruments of
Satan. Concerning the later part, see the preface.

Zuinglius against Luther.
tom. 2. lib. de Sacrame^tis fol 412.
Zuinglius says that Luther is a public, and manifest corrupter an adulterer
of holy scripture.

respons ad Confessione^ Lutheri fol. 408.
Again: behold [saith he] how Satan does endeavor wholly to possess this man.

in respons. ad Confess. Lutheri.
Oecolampadius forewarneth Luther, lest that being puffed up with arrogance and
pride, he be seduced by the Devil.

The deuynes of Tigur, Zuinglians against Luther.
in Confess. Germ impressa Tiguri anno 1544. in octaua fol. 3.
In time past [saith they] Luther put forth a book entitled, breuis confessio
de Sacramento, in which he does plead plainly for the heretical Sacramentaries
and most wicked men, and condemns Oecolampadius, Zuinglius, and all the
Tigurius; the book [say they] is full of Devils, full of shameful scoffinges
and mockeries, fol. 274.
it a boundeth in anger and fury, yea Luther forgeting God and his divinity
calls us a damnable and execrable Sect. But let him see whether by such
manner of angers and wicked taunts, he do not declare himself the
Archhereticke seeing he will not, nor cannot have any Society with those that
confess Christ: but how marueillously does Luther here bewray himself with
his Devils, what filthy words [say they] does he use, and such as are
replenished with all the Devils in Hell? for he says that the Devil dwells
both now and ever in the Zuinglians, and that they have a blasphemous breast,
insathanized, and that they have besides a most vain mouth, over which Satan
bears rule, being infused, perfused, and transfused into the same, did ever
man [say they] hear such speeches palse from a superious Devil himself? These
they.

Calvin against Luther.
The Lutherans [saith he] are a mad hare braind kind of people, a proud
faction of Giants, Admonitione 3. ad Ioachinium westphal.
frantic, beasts: prodigiously blind, desperately impudent, they are no other
then falsifiers and wicked slaunderers, froward, more then blockish, proud and
also so ignorant, that what is delivered to Children in Catechism, their elder
deuynes are altogegether ignorant of, a brute kind of wen. who did never know
or taste what value the supper of the lord is of, or to what end it does tend,
who also have not so much as a drope of shame in them, who are as if all their
whole life they had studied nothing but excommunications, in all their
writings, still threatening some thing or other exceeding all the Pops scribes
and Clerks, and thus railing they hope to over throw the most just cause of
the gospel.

Ioannes Campanus a Caluinist against Luther.
in Colloquijs Latinis Luth tom 2. cap. de aduersarijs fol. 154.
As Certain it is (says he) there is a God, so certain is it, that Luther is a
Devilish liar.

The Deuynes of Heidelberg against Luther.
Theologi Palatini in ordinatione ecclesiastica. in admonitione de lib.
concordiae bergensis cap. 9.
The Catechesmes (say they) of Luther and Brentius let them be cast out of the
Church, and their writings let them have no authority.

Again: Neither it is fit (say they) that Luther should be preferred, or
alleged against all ancient writers, or later; or according to his writing,
give sentence upon all things; much less to condemn all those of heresy,
that do not agree or consent with him, for the whole universal Church (say
they) has acknowledged as many of the ancient Doctors, as have lived in
former ages neither does the consent of the later, give authority to the elder,
but rather the elder to the later and therefore the ancient writers may be
opposed against the adversaries and not Luther or such like.

Ibid.
Also for as much as Luther was not a Prophet, or Elias, or an Evangelist, seeing
he has erred in many things, and in the Controversy of the supper, he had
not the word of the lord for a rule but an old opynion of the Papacy, and
invention of school men, when as there are found many crafty sentences in his
book Eristicis spread abroad to inconsideratly, slanders, reproaches, also
many things idly and very arrogantly spoken with out all piety and modesly,
scoffinge iestes in weighty matters, players frumptes, and unpleasant iestes,
and also many things bitterly and injuriously written, not only against the
Churches of Christ, against learned holy and Innocent men but also contumelious
against great princes, and altogether unworthy the person of a Christian
deuyne: for the causes (say they) Luthers books and sentences ought not, ought
not, I say, to be the rule of the Augustan Confession or of the Doctrine of the
lords supper. These they.

THE 51. ARTICLE. The Deaths of Luther Zuinglius and Calvin.
Luther says first of is own writings.
BEfore althinges (says he) I do beseech the reader, that these things he
read with judgment, In praefat. operum lat. tom. 1. In Genes. cap. 19. fol. 243.
yea with great commiseration, and let him know that once I was a Monk: yea I
my self (says he) do hate my own books and often times do wish them to
perish, This he spoke the year before his Death.

Again: how often [saith he] has my heart panted, tom. 2 Germ lentae. fol 9.
and praefat. lib. de abrog. Missae.
and reprehended me, and objected against me? what? art thou only wise? can it
be credible that all others do err and have erred so long a time? have all
generations so often been deceived? what if thou do err and bring so many
into error that shall be damned forever? In Colloq. mensal fol. 10. and praefat.
supra.


Moreover he says of himself: Art thou only he that has the pure word of
God? has no man in the world the same but thou? that which the Church of God
has hither to defined and so many years observed as good, do thou over
throw it as though it were evil, and so dissipate by thy doctrine all
ecclesiastical and Civil common weals? I never put (says he) these thoughts
and cogitations forth of my mind; that is, that this work and business (he
means his Apostacy) had never been begun by me, for what a great
multitude of men have I deceived by my Doctrine? I never had a greater and a
more grievous temptation therefore my preaching; Because (says he) I thought
with my self, thou have stirred up, all this tumult; in which temptation I have
been drowed even to hell it self, again because I have entered into this cause
(says he) now I must look unto it, and of necessity say, it is just, if you
ask a reason, Doctor Luther will have it so. Sic volo sic tubeo, sit pro
ratione voluntas; so I will, so I command it, let my will stand for a reason,
for we will not be scholars but masters and judges of Papists, yea we will
once (proteruire and insultare) be malapert and insult over them. I Doctor
Martyn Luther (says he) an unworthy Evangelist of our Lord Jesus Christ do
say and affirm this article (says a lone with out vvarkes does justify
before God) the Roman Emperor shall suffer it to stand and remain, the
Emperor of the Turks, the Emperor of the Tartares, the Emperor of the
Persians, the Pope of Rome, Cardinales, Bishops, Priests, In Colloquijs Mensal
fol. 241. tom. 5. Germ. fol. 241.
Monks, Nuns, Princes, Lords, the whole would withal devils I say shall
permit it, and moreover they shall have hell fire over their heads, and I will
give them no thanks for their payns, let this be my instinct from the holy
ghost of Doctor Luther, and my true and holy gospel.

Death of Luther.
Cochleus in vita Lutheri.
Luther was taken away by a subdayn death for when he had bine joyful and well
at a rich supper and by his merry conceits had provoked his frinds to much
laughter, that same very night he dyed.

Death of Zuinglius Oecolompadius.
Gualter says: In Apologia pro Zulnglio etc. fol. 32.
Zuinglius dyed in war (against Catholics) and armed in the field and these
our excellent censurers (says he) doubt not to pronounce Zuinglius himself to
be dead in sin, and therefore the son of Hell.

And a little after at Basil, Cochleus in Actis Lutheri 1531.
his spiritual brother Oecolampadius being well at night when he went to bed,
was found the newt morning dead by his wife.

Also Andreas Corolostadius was slain by the devil as the ministers of Basil
write in an epistle which they published of his death.

Death of Calvin.
Conradus Schlusselburge a Lutheran superintendent of the Diocese of
Ruceburge, Io Theolog. Caluinista l. 2. fol. 72.
and general ouerseer and co^troller of the ad joining Churches of Megaplensis
says,

God in the rod of his fury visiting Caluing did horribly punish him before the
fearful hour of his unhappy death, for he so strocke this heretic [so he
terms him in regard of his Doctrine concerning the Sacrament, and that God
is the author of sinne] with his mighty hand, that eating both himself and all
his, Bolsecus Cochlaeus and alij oculares testes. 2. Machab. 9 5.9.10. and Act.
12.23.
detesting God and the day of his birth despairing with horrible blasphemies
against the Saints and calling upon the Devil, so breathed out his soul, he
dyed [saith Conradus] being consumed by lyce and worms [a kind of death
wherewith God does often stricke the wicked as he did Antiochius in the Machabes
and Herod in the Acts of the Apostles] increasing in a most loath some ulcer
about his privy parts, so as none present could endure the stenche.

The things are objected to Calvin by publyke, writing, in which also horrible
things are declared concerning his lasciuiousnes, his sundry abominable vices
and Sodomiticall lusts. For which [last] he was by the magistrate [at Noyon]
under whom he lived branded on the shoulder with a hoate burning iron
whereunto as yet I see no sound or clear answer.

Here, Dear, Mother, I have made a summarie Collection of what soever I could
imagine to make for your Satisfaction in this so weighty a matter as the
happiness of your own, with the souls of your whole family and friends, for
all eternity; not dilating or making any application of the least article, but
rather leaving all to your discret judgment to comment upon so plain, evident
and perspicuous atext, where you may [as the darkness of Egypt] even feel the
truth with your hand. This course I have the rather embraced, to avoyde
tediousnes in so copious a matter, and where that sentence of our Savior may
most aptly be applied: Luke 19. V. ^2.
By thine own mouth I judge thee, O naughty servant. Our earnest prayer and
whole devotion night and day for a good success. Amen.

But for your last farewell take this sentence of S. Augustine upon the Fathers
and Doctors of the primitive Church.

Lib. 2 contra Iulianum,
Those Bishops [saith he] were learned, grave, holy most earnest defenders of
the faith and truth against all tatling vanities, in whose sentence, learning
liberty etc. thou can not despise any thing.

Ibidem.
Again: The ancient Fathers [saith he] sought not friendship either with us
or you, nor yet were at enmytie with either of us: with us or you they were not
offended; neither us nor you did they pity: but what they found in the Church
that they held; what they had learned that they taught: what themselves had
learned of their fore Fathers, the same they delivered to their Children.

These, that best, most worthy learned, As Call. etc. in the 3. tro^tysc
confess.
and sincere witness of all Antiquity yet that ever was since the Apostles
times, or is like to follow after him, S. Austine, whereby you may collect that
these Fathers aught only what they had from time to time from the Apostles, yea
Christ himself; contrariwyse yours the Fancy of their own brainsicke
invention, never heard of before, I mean in frameing a religion of so many old
condemned heresies composed into one never before held by any one particular
person.

Dear Mother, Brethren, and Sisters with the rest my good frinds, once more I
humbly take my leave of you, heseeching you all, to make some good use of these
my pains, for undoubtedly if they turn not to your good, they will much
dommage you, and that through your own default, for what says our Savior! if
I had not come, and spoken unto them, John 15.2^.
they should not have sinned: but now they have no excuse for their sin. So
plain is this matter made unto you, wherefore, I pray, let not me be a means to
increase your sin, and consequently your future torment. Far Well.

FINIS.
