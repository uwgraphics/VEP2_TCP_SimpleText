The prologe.
When I aduert in my remembrance
The famous draughtes of poets eloquent
Which their minds did well enhaunce
Books to contryue that were expedyent
To be remembered without Impedyment
For the profit of humanyte
This was the custume of antyquyte.
I now simple and most rude
And naked in depured eloquence
For dulnes rethoryke does exclude
Wherefore in making I lake intellygence
Also considering my great negligence
It fereth me sore for to endyte
But at adventure I will now write.
As very blind in the poetys art
For I thereof can no thing skyll
Wherefore I lay it all a part
But somewhat according to my will
I will now write for to fulfill
Saint Powles words and true sentement
All that is written is to our document
O prudent Gower in langage pure
Without corrupcyon most facundyous
O noble Chauser ever most sure
Of frutfull sentence right delycyous
O virtuous Lydgat much sentencyous
Unto you all I do me excuse
Though I your conning do now use
Explicit prologus.
Capitulum primu^

IN Septembre in falling of the lefe
When phoebus made his declynacyon
And all the whete gadred was in the shefe
By radyaunt hete and operacyon
When the vyrgyn had full domynacyon
And Dyane entered was one degree
Into the sign of Gemyne
When the golden sterres clear were splendent
In the firmament puryfyed clear as crystal
By imperyall course without incombrement
As Iuppyter and Mars that be celestyall
With Saturn and Mercury that were supernall
Myxt with venus that was not retrograte
That caused me to be well fortunate
In a slombrynge sleep with sloth oppressed
As I in my naked bed was leyd
Thinking all night to take my rest
Morpleus to me than made abreyd
And in my dreme me thought he said
Come walk with me in a medowe amerous
Depeynted with flowers that be delycyous
I walked with him into a place
Where that there grue many a fair flower
With Joy replete and full of solace
And the trees dystyllynge redolent lycoure
More sweter fer than the Aprell shour
And tarry I did there by long space
Till that I saw before my face
A right fair lady of myddell stature
And also enduyd with great virtue
Her apparel was set with perlys pure
Whose beauty always did renew
To me she said and ye will extue
All wyldnes I will be your guide
That ye to fraylte shall not slide.
Unto her I answerde o lady glorious
I pray you tell me what is your name
For ye seem to be right precious
And I am young and sore to blame
Of vices full and in virtue lame
But I will be ruled now by your pleasure
So that your order be made by mesure
Eclepyd I am she said dyscrecyon
And if ye will be ruled by me
Ye shall have Joy without reprehencyon
And never fall in to fragylyte
Youth lacking me it is great pity
For in what place I am exyled
They be with sin right often defiled
It longs ever unto my properte
Youth to give courage for to learn
I will not meddle with no duplycyte
But faythfulnes I will dyscerne
And bring thy soul to bless eterne
By wise example and moral doctrine
For youth having to me is a good syne
Forsake also all evil company
And be found true in word and deed
Remember that this world is transytory
After thy desert shall be thy mede
Love god always and eke him dread
And for no man's pleasure be thyn own foo
Give them fair words and let them goo
Be to thy king ever true subgete
As thou sholdest be by right and reason
Let thy heart lowely on him be sete
Without any spot of evil treason
And be obedyent at every season
Unto his grace without rebellyon
That thou with troth may be companyon
Love never vnloued for that is pain
While that thou lyuest of that beware
Love as thou see the loved again
Or else it will torn the to care
Be never taken in that fast snare
Prove or thou love that is most sure
And than thou in doubt shall not endure.
Beware believe no flaterynge tongue
For flaterers be most disseyuable
Though that they company with the long
Yet at the end they will be varyable
For they by reason are not favorable
But evermore falls and double
And with their tongues cause of great trouble
This brytell world ay full of bytternes
Always turnynge like to a ball
No man in it can have no sykernes
For when he clymmeth he has a fall
O wauerynge shadow bitter as gall
O fatal wealth full soon at end
Though thou ryghthy do often assende
When she to me had made relacyon
Of all these proverbs by good conclusyon
She gave to me an Informacyon
For to depryue all ill abusyon
And to consydre the great derysyon
Which is in youth that may not se
No thing appropred to his prosperyte
Forth than we went to an haven side
Where was a ship lyenge at rode
Taryenge after the wind and tide
And with much spyces right well lode
Upon it lokynge we long abode
Till colus with blastes began to rore
Than we her aborded with pain right sore
This water eclyped was vayneglory
Ever with yeopardy and tempestyous
And the ship called was right truly
The vessel of the passage dangerous
The wawys were high and greatly troublous
The captayn called was good comfort
And the sterysman fair pasport
Capitulum.ii.
Long were we driven with wind and weder
Till we arrived in a fair Ilonde
Where was a boot tied with a teeder
Of merueylous wood as I understand
Precious stones ley upon the sond
And poynted dyamondes grew on the rocks
And coral also by ryghthyghe stocks
Amassed I was for to behold
The precious stones under my fete
And the earth glysterynge of gold
With flowers fair of odor sweet
Dame dyscrecyon I did than great
Praynge her to me to make relacyon
Who of this Ilonde has domynacyon
She said four ladies in virtue excellent
Of which the eldest is dame nature
That daily fourmeth after her intent
Every be and living creature
Both foul and fair and also pure
All that dependynge in her ordinance
Where that she favors there is great pleasaunce
The second is called dame fortune
Against whom can be no resystence
For she does set the strings in tune
Of every person by her magnyfycence
When they sound best by good experyence
She will them loose and let them slyp
Causynge them fall by her turnynge tryp
The third called is dame hardynes
That often rulyth by her cheualry
She is right stowt and of great prowes
And the captayn of a lusty company
And rules them ever full hardely
And to get honor and worldely tresure
She puts her often in adventure
The fourth is wisdom a^ lady bright
Which is my lyster as ye shall se
Whom I do love with all my might
For she enclyneth ever to benygnyte
And medeleth not with fraud nor subtylyte
But makes many noble clerks
And rules them in all their works
They dwell all in a fair castle
Beside a river much deep and clear
And be expert in feytys manuell
That unto them can be no peer
Of erthely person that lives here
For they be so fair and wounderous
That them to se it is solacyous.
Long have they trauerst greatly in the law
Which of them should have the preemynence
And none of them their case will withdraw
Till of dame Justice they know the sentence
They argue often and make defense
Each unto other withouten remedy
I will no longer of them specefy
Capitulum tercium.

COme on fair youth and go with me
Unto that place that is delectable
Bylded with towers of curyosyte
And yet though that ye be lamentable
When thou art there you wylt be confortable
To se the merueyles that there be wrought
No man can prynt it in his thought
A path we found right gretely used
Where in we went till at the last
A castle I saw whereof I mused
Not fully from me a stones cast
To se the towers I was aghast
Set in a valey so strongely fortefyed
So gentle compassed and well edefyed
The towers were high of adamond stones
With fanes wanerynge in the wind
Of right fine gold made for the noonys
And roobuckes ran under the lynde
And hunters came them fer behind
A Joy it was such saw I never
Abide quod she ye shall se a better.
Forth she me led to the castle ward
Where we were let in by humylyte
And so after she led me forward
Till that I saw a royal tree
With buddys blossomed of great bellute
And than we went in to the hall
That glased was truly with crystal
And hanged was with clothes of Aras
Made of fine gold with a noble story
Now that there some time reynynge was
In the regyon of high Italy
A valiant emperdur and a mighty
That had to name for so the Tyberius
Which did enquere of prudent Iosethus
Why he his officers so long kept
Unto him he answered a good cause why
Sometime I saw a man that slepte
That wounded was full pyteously
And on his wounds suckynge many a fly
I than for pity moved them away
By which he woke and to me did say
Where that thou trowed to me comfort
Thou now have done me double greuaunce
Putting away the flies that did resort
To me being full of blody sustynaunce
By this thou may have good perseueraunce
That now will come the flies most hungry
That will me byte.x. times more grievously
The roof was wrought by merueylous gemetry
Colered with asure gold and gowlys
With knottes coruen full right craftily
And set also with wanton fowlys
As popyniays / pyes / Iays / and owlys
And as I looked on my right side
A lady I saw of meruellous pride
Sitting in a chayer at the upper end
Of all the hall as a lady and princes
Among many kings that did entende
To be obedyent to her high noblenes
Her apparel was made of much fair riches
Set with rubyes most pure and rubicound
Embrawded with perles and many a dyamound
Besides her sat the worthyes nine
And she among them a whele turnynge
Full low to her they did than enclyne
She sometime laughing and sometime lowrynge
Her condycyon was to be dyssymelynge
And many exalten upon her whele
Gyuynge them great falls that they did feel
Than said dyscrecyon behold and see
That in dame fortune is no stablenes
This world also is but a vanyte
A dreme a pomp nothing in stedfastnes
For fortune is false and full of doblenes
When she most flatereth she is not sure
As thou may se daily in ure
Capitulum. iiii.

FOrth than we went unto the habytacle
Of dame hardynes most pure and fair
Above all places a right fair spectacle
Strowyd with flowers that gave good eyer
Of virtuous turkeys there was a cheyr
Wherein she sat in her cote armure
Berynge a shield the field of asure
Wherein was set a rampynge lion
Of fine gold right large and great
Aswerd she had of merueylous fassyon
As though a thousand she should beat
No man the vyctory of her might get
A noble vyrgyn there did her serve
That first made harnes called Mynerue
The chaumbre where she held her consystory
The dew aromatyke did often degoute
Of fragraunt flowers full of delycasy
That all ill heirs did ensence out
A carbuncle there was that all about
Enlumyned the chaumbre both day and night
My thought u was an heavenly sight
Nine queen's I saw that satte her by
Being all armed of great fortytude
In many a stower they wanne the vyctory
And were endued with facounde pulcrytude
For to haunte arms was their consuetude
Many a regyon they often wanne
And also vaynquysshed many a noble man
Next unto her sat the high queen Azia
That was a conqueres so puyssaunt
And beside her the queen of Saba
Which in great riches was tryumphaunt
And also Ipolyte in arms valiant
Sat with her beside queen Hecuba
And yet also the queen Europa
Present there was the wiche queen Juno
And queen Pantasyll with fair queen Elyn
And yet I saw by her than also
The noble vyrgyn young Polyxyn
That was destroyed at the last ruyn
Of Troy the great by cruel Pyrrus
The sone of Achylles that was so cheualrus
As I did look I had commandment
Of dame dyscrecyon for to remember
These noble ladies so pure and excellent
Hardy in courage of age right tender
Yet not withstanding death did surrendre
And all their strength and lusty courage
For he spares another youth ne age
Capitulum.v.

FOrth we walked to the dwelling place
Of dame sapyence so full of blys
Replete with Joy virtue and grace
No thing there lacked that possible is
Man for to comfort withouten mys
Though he were derke in wordely folly
He should there b enlumyned shortly
Her tower was made of works curyous
I can no thing extend the goodlynes
Of her palace so good and glorious
Bylded in the place soth of faslnes
With owten taste of wordely bytternes
No person can extol the souerente
Of her worthy and royal dygnyte
She each estate should have in governance
As them to rule or that they repent
For better it is to have good puruyaunce
At the beginning as is expedyent
Than for to wyssh for things myspent
That might be saved long before
And with a for wit kept in store
Her chaumbre was glased with byrall clarefyed
Depeynted with colors of delectacyon
A place of pleasure so heavenly gloryfyed
In virtue heal life and salvation
Without any stormy trybulacyon
That might anoy the heavenly health
But always comfort to the sowlys wealth
There sat dame prudence in virtue magnyfyed
Impossyble it is to show her goodelyhed
She was so fair and clearly puryfyed
And so dyscrete and full of womanhede
That and I trow virtue were deed
It should reuyue yet in her again
She was so gentle and without dysdeyn
It was great comfort unto my heart
For to behold that heavenly sight
Dyscrecyon said I should not depert
Till I had spoken with her sister bright
Forth she me led with all her might
Unto that princes and royal souerayn
Ergo my labor was not in vayn
Than spoke dame prudence with meke contenau^ce
Welcome dyscrecyon my sister dear
Where have ye ben by long contynuaunce
With youth she said that ye se here
And for my sake I you requere
Him to receive in to your seruyse
And he shall serve you in goodely wise
Welcome she said for my systers sake
And yet also now for your own
In to my service I will you take
Sythens that your wyldnes is ouerblowen
The sede of virtue on you shall be sown
Uyce to depryue by his good auctoryte
As for subdue all ill iniquyte
Of other meunes words be thou not bold
And of their promys make no behest
And if thou here an ill tale told
Give no judgment but say the best
So shall thou live evermore in rest
Who little medeleth is best at ease
For well were he that all might please
Beware keep the from great offense
That thou condemned be not by ryghtwysnes
When she does give her mortal sentence
Without pease or mercy cause her reles
Her judgment of mortal heaviness
That the best friend to the will be
The for to socour in great necessyte
But yet in them have none affyaunce
As first to sin thinking that they
At the end to the will be delyueraunce
Nay ryghtwysnes will drive them away
For of all sins without delay
Such sin in hope it is the most
For it is the sin of the holy ghoost
Now I amytte you into your rome
In the which ye shall your self apply
Of mine own chaumbre ye shall be grome^
Look ye be dylygent and do not vary
From my commandments never specially
For and ye will them well observe
A much better rome ye do deserve
The first commandment that I give the
Think on the end or thou begin
For thou by right may know the certente
That death is fine of every sin
Be never taken in dyabolycall engyne
But that repentance may loose the sone
Of that great sin that thou have done
Trust not to much in fortunes grace
Though that she laugh on the a while
For she can suddenly turn her face
When that she list the to begyle
She wealth and Joy can sone defyle
And plonge the in the pity of pouerte
Wherefore in her have thou no suertye
Presume no ferther than the behooves
For it will turn the to great shame
For who that from his rome remoueth
He is often full gretely to blame
And medeleth with other in them lame
As no thing conuynge nor expert
They may him say sir malapert
Or that thou speak call to remembrance
Unto what matter thy word shall sygnyfye
Look that it torn no man to greuaunce
Though that it be spoken merely
Yet many a one will take it grievously
Which that might cause wroth and debate
While that thou lives beware of that
For a thing (...) without (...)
Look that thou never be to pensyfe
Thank god of ^^^ynke to have an other
Let wysedom than be to the comfortyfe
That to thy brayn is (...) preseruatyfe
For evermore right wise is he
That can be pacyent in aduersyte
Prove thy friend (...) matter feigned
Or thou have need than shall thou se
Whyther he be ^^^^y with the retained
The for to socour in thy necessyte
By proof thou may (...) we the veryte
For proof before that need requere
Defeteth dowte ever in ^ere
Be thou never so blind in will
Yet look thou be reformed by reason
Than shall thou my mind fulfill
And thou thereto thy self abandon
Strive not with reason for none encheson
For where she lacks there is great outrage
And without he may not aswage
Eschew also the sin of pride
The mother and the fervent role
Of all the sins at every tide
Wherefore trede thou her under foot
With help of virtue so sweet and sote
Which is best salve to hele thy sore
And to thy health the to restore
Woe worth sin without repenta^unce
Woe worth bondage without reles
Woe worth man without good governance
Woe worth infynall pain and dystresse
Woe worth vice put fer in press
Woe worth soueraynte having dysdeyn
And woe worth pity that does refrayn
Woe worth right that may not be herd
Woe worth frendshyp without stabylyte
Woe worth true sentence that is deferd
Woe worth the man full of duplycyte
Woe worth him without benygnyte
Woe worth lybertye withouten pease
And woe worth crueltye that may not cease
Woe worth conning that is abused
Woe worth promys withouten payment
Woe worth virtue that is refused
Woe worth trouble without extynguysment
Woe worth folly on message sent
Woe worth reason that is exyled
And woe worth troth that is defiled
Woe worth the trust without assurance
Woe worth grace not set by
Woe worth Justice kept in dystaunce
Woe worth wealth replete with envy
Woe worth the battle without vyctory
Woe worth beginning without good end
And woe worth wrong that does defend
These commandments I put in memory
Them for to keep doing my dylygence
With dame Sapyence I did long tarry
Which did me teache with partynge influence
Of her delycate and doulcete complacence
Than spoke dyscrecyon anon to me
In the presens of her systers mageste
Thou art beholdynge to my sister reverent
That the retained has unto her servant
Wherefore be thou to her obedyent
And at every hour to her attendaunt
And ryotous company do thou not haunt
For that will pair and ill thy name
Wherefore of virtuous mirth let be thy game
Capitulum.vi.

DIscrecyon ferther forth me led
Unto the solemn and royal mancyon
Of dame nature in humayne stead
Right pleasant was her habytacyon
Of merueylous work and sytuacyon
And she her self held her estate
In a glorious chaumbre without chekmate
Her tower was gylted full of son hemys
And within hanged with cloth of aras
The roof was painted with golden stremys
And like crystal depured was
Every wyndowe about of glass
Where that she sat as a fair gods
All things creatynge by her besynes
Me thought she was of merueylous beauty
Till that Dyscrecyon led me behind
Where that I saw all the pryuyte
Of her work and humayne kind
And at her back I did than find
Of cruel death a dolfull image
That all her beauty did perswage
Full wondrous was her operacyon
In every kind eke and right degree
Withouten rest or recreacyon
I will not meddle with her secret
For it no thing longs to my faculte
But somewhat after I will expres
Of her great power and worthynes
But in my book well for to proceed
Dame dyscrecyon ferther me brought
Into a fair chamber as ye may read
Of fine gemetry right well wrought
To comfort man there lacked naught
But that me thought there was no company
Save only dame dyscrecyon and I
We had been but a little while there
But that we saw a lady clear
Right well appareled in sad gere
Mylde in her hauour dyscrete of chere
That came us by and very nere
Ascendynge up in to her high sete
Garnysshed with perle and with gold beat
Than said dyscrecyon this is dame Justice
Clean of conscience without corrupcyon
And never be spotted with the sin of couetyse
But true as stele in the entencyon
Of right evermore without destruccyon
Geuynge always a ryghtfull judgment
Obey thou youth this lady reverent
A judge fulfilled with the sin of auaryce
Or with favor of kynne made blind
Must nedys do wrong by great p^iudyce
For favor should not conscience bynd
Right to dyssymyll as I now find
In problemys written of antiquyte
Made by philosophers of auctoryte
As we stood talking thus to gydere
Up came dame fortune so gayly gloryfyed
Impossyble it is for me to dyscouere
Now gorges she was and greatly magnyfyed
Full like a gods that had been deyfyd
Clothed with gold set full of rubyes
And tynst with emeraudys and many a turks
And next to her there did ensue
Dame Hardynes that noble lady
After whom anon did pursue
Dame Sapyence which did not tarry
Than came dame nature appareled royally
And all the other cladde in gold
Set with dyamondes many a fold
They lowted all unto the ground
Before dame Justice for obeysaunce
That sat there both hole and sound
Withouten any dyscontynuaunce
Gyuynge god ere unto the vteraunce
Of these four ladies pledynge at bar
With all their cases did well a varre
Capitulm.vii.

First dame hardynes began to plede
Saying she was to man most profitable
For she the hertes has often feed
Of conquerous as it was couenable
And by my courage have made them able
Regyons to win their enemies to subdue
And if I were not they had it rue
And if a ma^n be never so wise
Withouten me he getyth none vteraunce
Wherefore his wisdom may not suffyse
All only without mine allegeaunce
For I by right must nedys enhauncce
A low born man to an high degree
If that he will be ruled by me
Have I not caused many a noble warreour
To win the batell by my great might
Without me was made never conqueror
Nor yet man coragious when he did fight
No man without me may defend his right
I may be worst from him forborne
For and I were not he were forlorn
Did I not cause the noble hercules
By my power to win the vyctory
Of the sturdy and strong Philotes
As is recorded in books of memory
For without me can be no cheualry
And under the wynge of my proteccyon
All rebels brought be to subieccyon
A realm is vpholden by things three
The first and the chyef it is the swerd
Which causes it to be in good suerte
And other realms of it to be aferd
By which the usurpers be dyfferd
From their will with treason knyte
And by me slain for their falls fyte
The second is law that ever serves
But within the realm only
For other nacyons our law ne dredeth
But our swerd they do in specially
For and they roose against us proudly
As they have done often in times past
Yet with our swerd they should be ouercast
The third be merchants that do multyply
In this realm wealth and prosperyte
For of every thing they often occupy
Every man like unto his faculte
For without merchants can not be
No realm vpholden in wealth and pleasure
For it to us is a special tresure
Also yet hercules the puyssaunt geaunt
Did slay the monstre before Troy the great
And with his strokes he did him daunt
They were so peysantly on him set
That he the vyctory on him did get
Had I not be comfort unto his heart
Such vyctory had been leyd aparte
Did he not vaynquysshe in ye forest of Nemee
The three mortal lions by his great hardynes
And ryued their Jaws as was to se
By twene his hands by chyualrus prowes
And yet by arms and knyghtly exces
In egypt he slew the tyrant Busyre
And brent him after in a great fire
Also he slew the tyrant Cacus
For his tyranny and great myschefe
By cause his dedys were so odyous
For he did murdre and was a thief
Wherefore his death to many was leef
Who more of his acts will have report
To the Troyans story let him resort
Also the worthy and the noble hectour
That eclyped was the troyans champyon
And of all cheualry called the flour
In his time reynynge and of renown
Of whose noble deeds the brute and sown
Was spread by every strange habytacyon
That they of his faytys did make relacyon
By his power and hardy courage
He put the greeks full often to flight
And beat them down by a great outrage
That well was he that him save might
Full often he brought them to the plyght
His deeds were pure without magycyon
And without nygromancy or such corrupcyon
Did I not cause also king dauith
A lion Iawbones to rent and tere
That did devour his sheep in the fryth
As he sat keeping of them there
The lions crueltye might not him fere
And he in his youth so hardy was
That he did sle the gyaunt Golias
Did I not cause the noble Julius
Emperor of rome for to be elect
By cause he was so strong and cheualrus
When in arms he knew the affecte
He all his enemies did abiecte
And by the support of my chyef socour
He governed him self like a noble emperor
And also Arthur king of Bretayne
With all the knights of the round table
Never auentures had sought certain
And I thereto had not ben greable
They for to fight had not ben able
Who that me lacks is but a coward
And shame is ever his reward
Also king Charlemayne king of France
With his dyssypers Rowland and Olyuer
With all the resydue of his alyaunce
That in all arms so noble were
On goddys enemies brake many a spear
Causynge them to flee to their great vylony
Hardynes was cause that they had vyctory
O worthy hardynes the shynynge sterre
Always to mannys heart the comfort
When that it is the time of werre
Unto what party that thou resort
They win the batall by thy support
And where that thou let thy bemys dyssende
They often hye to honor assende
Than said dame hardynes unto the Judge
I pray you that right I may have
Sythens I to man am chyef refuge
When that he lysteth of me to crave
I make him coragyous and his worship save
Wherefore I owte to have the preemynence
By right reason and good experyence
That I deny you said dame Sapyence
Of whom have you your order of pledynge
For ye never can have none intellygence
But by the mean of mine informynge
For I am always your mind techynge
And without me your tale were but a fable
For ye without wit should always babble
This will I prove by mine opinion
That I am ground of the arts seven
And of all good works in co^munyon
For no man without me can go to heaven
My dedys be merueylous for man to neuen
When they beu wrought in to their degree
Who that will learn them he has the lyberte
Of my deeds books do make record
The which clerks put into remembrance
For an example without dyscorde
Of heavenly way by virtuous governance
Without me man can have no pleasaunce
Nor yet him rule in no manner wise
A man without wit is to despise
Hardynes without prudence may not avail
Though that a man be never so sturdy
For a wyseman feeble may win the battle
Of him that is right strong and mighty
For better it is for to be right wytty
In the defense of his good save guard
Than often to stryke and to run forward
That thing that hardynes may not win
May be gotten by my high souerente
And with the help of subtyle engynne
It may be brought to the extremyte
Where that it might not by possybylyte
Of hardynes long before he won
Yet by great wisdom it may be done
Unto diverse cases I take excepcyon
Of dame Hardynes which are no law
Unto the first under your correccyon
She said and she her power did wythdrawe
No rebel than should stand in awe
And she is the chyef as I know well
That causes him for to be rebel
By her folly and folyssne hardynes
She causes men to rise against their lord
She is the cause of mortal heaviness
When she does break the good concord
Wherefore me think by one accord
For to exyle her it is now the best
Than man should live in peace and rest
And where she said that she exalted
Julius caesar by her great exylence
In that case she right clearly varyed
For it was I by my great dylygence
That never was out of his presence
But ruled him and made him worthy
To be chosen emperor of all Italy
Chofen he was by the common assent
For the great wisdom that in him shone
With a great voice and a hole entente
For like unto him was there none
That was so abell as he alone
For to occupye an Emperors dygnyte
Of his promocyon he might thank me
I Sapyence am endewed with grace
And the lode sterre of heavenly doctrine
The spring of comfort Joy and solace
Who that list to me for to enclyne
He shall know things that be dyuyue
And at his end behold the deyte
That is one god and persons three
It pleased the fader that is omnipotent
His sone to send to be incarnat
Of the vyrgyn Mary the sterre most excellent
Maiden and mother yet not vyolate
Like a vessel chosen and made ornat
All only for to be goddys mother
And he him self unto man brother
But a strife there was between god and man
When man consented to sin dedely
By that the dyscorde first began
When he the sone of god on hy
That is his brother again will crucefy
If he had power by which is offended
The fader of heaven as is intended
Therefore let us to our brother go
Named Ihesu Christ and axe him mercy
With a good intent and heart also
There is for us none other remedy
That any tongue truly can specyfy
And he will take it for a correccyon
And of all vengeance sease the affection
That we may of him have forgyuenes
Of our great sin with reformacyon
Of peace between the faders hyghenes
Of heaven and us in suspyracyon
Therefore if thou dread the amocyon
Of his ryghtwysnes look that thou flee
Right fast unto his merciful pity
For his mercy is more than all our mysery
And eke above his works all
As Dauyd shows in his prophecy
Saying his mercy is over all
To whom I pray ever in especyall
To give me grace well my pen to lead
That quaketh aye for dread
Dame Sapyence said I do proceed
Of the strength of the holy ghoost
That is and shall be matter in deed
God and lord of myghtys most
Whose infynall power was never lost
And yet never had no beginning
But always like strong without ending
Where that dame hardynes in her pledynge
Made her self to knights most necessary
By the means of her power showing
That I by right do now well deny
For in that case she did much vary
For six there are that more profit be
Of which the lest is better than she
The first is prudence that is the chief
That him does rule and is his gyde
And keeps him from great reprefe
And causes his worship for to abide
So every christian man should provide
By his wit to withstand the devil
That he consent not to do evil
The second is that he should be true
To his souerayn lord that on him reyneth
And all treason for ever to eschew
In which great shame often remains
And by which he his ky^ne dysteyneth
So a christian man should be true ever
To Ihesu Christ that was his redemer
The third is that he should be lyberall
Among his commons withouten let
That is the cause ever in general
That he the love of them does get
For it causes their hertes on him be set
So every true christian man should be
To god intended with lyberalyte
The fourth is that he should be strong
His right ever for to defend
And never to no man for to do wrong
But wrongs for to dyrecte and amend
As far as his power will extend
So a true christian man should exclude
All manner of vices by his fortytude
The fyfth is yt he should be mercyable
In all his deeds withouten furoure
For that to him is greatly conuenable
And eke to keep him out of error
For he of mercy should be a myrroure
So unto them it is right necessary
Who that will be saved for to have mercy
The syxte is a knight ought for to keep
The poor folk in their great need
That often for hungre and thyrst do weep
He ought with alms them for to feed
And the better he shall than speed
So every true christian man should do
As far as his power comes unto
I Sapyence am of the kings counsayll
Which is clothed with purple that sygnyfyeth
The grace and the pulcrytude without fayll
Of great virtues that in him shyneth
For to no vices he never enclyneth
Having in his head a fair crown royal
That shows his dygnyte to be regal
Which to his people is the chief glory
Through whom his subgectes be dyrecte
And made obedyent to him certainly
At every hour by right true effect
But forthermore by good aspecte
He bears a ball in his left hand
The which betokens as I understand
A king to be a good admynystratour
Unto his subgectes in every place
And to be for them a good prouysour
As reason requires in every case
I Sapyence do rule his noble grace
In his right hand he has a septure
That does sygnyfye by right his rygoure
Ill men to punysshe for their offense
By his ryghtwysnes whom the love
Of virtue shynynge in experyence
Does not extol nor yet now remove
A lamp does hang his heed above
Always light and clearly brennynge
Which sygnyfyeth the mercy of a king
The old philosophers by their prudence
Fond the seven scyences lyberall
And by their exercise and great dylygence
They made their deeds to be memoryall
And also poets that were fatal
Craftily colored with clowdy fygures
The true sentence of all their scryptures
O Justice lady and sovereign goddess
Give you true sentence now upon me
As ye be surmountynge in virtue and noblesse
Let me dame Sapyence have the soueraynte
As is according to my royal dygnyte
For I am most profitable unto man
And ever had been syns the world began
Than said dame Fortune ye are imperfyte
Without that I thereto be accordaunt
For all your hardynes and prudence perfyte
I unto you must be well exuberaunt
And with your works ever concordaunt
Where that I fauer they have good comfort
In all their deeds by my sweet resort
I Fortune am the rule and steer
Of every person like to my will
That in this world now lives here
When that I list for to fulfill
My mind right sone I can dystyll
The dew of comfort wealth and richesse
To man exaltyuge him to nobleness
Though that a man were never so hardy
Without me he might not attain
And though that a man were never so wytty
And I did my power from him refrain
All his labor were lost in vain
So hardynesse and prudence in no wise
Without good fortune may well suffyse
Though that a man were but a fool
If I consent that he be fortunate
He nedyth not to make no great dole
For I shall mayntene so his estate
That he in richesse shall be so eleuate
Fulfilled with wealth and worldely tresure
That he shall lack no manner of pleasure
Where that dame hardynes would afferme
By her cases that are so unsure
That she by her power does conferme
The knights of vyctory for to be sure
When she does take their hertes in cure
If fortune be a way she may not avail
For they by reason must lose the battle
Yet forthermore as I do well consider
How dame hardynes did express
Sythens the time that I came hyder
That she promoted had to worthynes
Hector david and the noble hercules
With many other whereof she fails
For it was fortune as she well knows
For in old time the noble warryours
For to eschew ever my great daungere
In which time they were ydolestours
Than they to put him out of fere
To ydols went that their gods were
For to have answer if they should win The battle or they did begin
What need I pleed by long contynuaunce
As dame Sapyence did in matters hy
It were of time but dyscontynuaunce
But o dame Justice the gentle lady
Look that ye Judge my matter right wisely
That I of hardynes may be the pryncypall
And of dame prudence and nature with all
Than said dame nature that may not be
As I can prove by right and reason
For I am most confort to humanyte
As man well knows at every encheason
And can not be forborne for none season
For where I lack without any delay
Man is but deed and turned to clay
That nature gives by her power
Wisdom nor hardynes may not defete
For I to man am the chief doer
During his life without retrete
Also dame fortune may not well let
Me of my course though she it thought
In sondery wise my deeds are so wrought
Though that a man were infortunable
And though that he were never so folysshe
And a great coward to fight not able
Yet should he live and never perysshe
Till that my power of him does fynysshe
Which fail must ones it is my proprete
And that was given me by the deyte
I am the orygynall of man's creacyon
And by me always the world does multyply
In wealth pleasure and delectacyon
As I will show now in this party
My deeds be subtle and wrought craftily
What were the world if I were note
It were sone done as I well wot
The law of nature does man bind
Both best foul and fysshe also
In their degree to do their kind
Blame them not if they do so
For hard it is ever to over go
The kind of nature in her degree
For every thing must show his proprete
Who of their propretes list to read
Let him look in the book of barthelmewe
And to his scripture take good head
That right nobly of them do show
With all their acts being not a few
But wounderous many by alteracyon
For like has like his operacyon
I nature norysshe by mine afflyccyon
Man's humayne parties superfyxcyall
And am the spring of his complexion
The fonteyne of his veins inferyall
To him conserve most dear and special
Though he were hardy and wise he myzt not me forbere
Nor fortune without me avails not him a pere
Wherefore dame Justice be you now indyfferent
Consydre that I am most dear and lefe
Unto every man that is eliquylent
And above all medicines to him most chief
And by my strongh unto him relefe
In his disease wherefore as think me
I ought of reason to have the soueraynte
Than spoke dame Justice with meke contenau^ce
I will all your contrauersy now redress
For I of your reasons have good perseueraunce
And after your cases both more and less
Wherefore I Justice by good ryghtwysnesse
Give now upon you a fynall Judgment
That ye four agree by a hole assent
Man for to please at every hour
Without dysgrement or contradiccyon
And in his need to do him socoure
With loving heart and true affection
He shall be in your good iurysdyccyon
And you of him shall be copertyners
Both of his life and of his manners
Than said dame hardynes I agree thereto
And so do I than said dame Sapyence
Than said dame Fortune I also do
Agree unto dame Justice sentence
And I dame Nature will do my dylygence
Like as ye do man for to please
And him to strength in his disease
With that dame Justice up arose
Unto the ladies bidding fare well
And went into her chaumbre close
I cleped conscience where she did dwell
As dame Dyscrecyon did me tell
Than hardynes and fortune went down the stayre
And after them Nature so clear and fair
Capitulum.viii.
DAme Sapyence tarried a little while
Behynd the other saying to Dyscrecyon
And began on her to laugh and smyle
Axynge her how I stood in condycyon
Well she said in good perfeccyon
But best it is that he married be
For to eschew all ill censualyte
I know a lady of marvelous beauty
Spronge out of high and noble lynage
Replete with virtue and full of bounte
Which unto youth were a good marriage
For she is comen of royal apparage
But herd it will be to get her love
Without youth frayltye do sore reprove
I kneled down than upon my kne
Before dame Sapyence with humble chere
Besechynge her of me to have pity
And also Dyscrecyon her sister dear
Than dame Sapyence came me nere
Saying youth will ye have a wife
And her to love during her life
Ye madame that would I feign
If that she be both fair and bright
I will her love ever more certain
And pleas her always with all my might
Of such a person would I have a sight
With all my heart now at this hour
Would to god I had so fair a flower
Than said dyscrecyon there is a king
Dwelling fer hens in a fair castle
Of whom I often have herd great talking
Which has a daughter as I you tell
I trow that youth will like her well
She is both good eke fair and pure
As I report me unto dame Nature
But if that youth should her go seek
Ye must sister than him well indue
With your great power so good and meke
That he all frayltye may eschew
For by the way it will often pursue
On him by flatery and great temptacyon
That shall bring him in tribulacyon
As for that said she he shall not care
For he shall them sone overcome
And of their flatery right well beware
For I to him shall give great wisdom
Their deeds to withstand and make them do^me
Wherefore dear sister as I you pray
Unto her led him now on the way
Look that ye send me in his necessyte
By dame swyftnes full sone a letter
By which that I may know the certaynte
That I may come to aid him beter
So that fraylte to him be no freter
And though I be not always vysyble
With him my power he has inuyncyble
Than said dame Sapyence to dyserecyon
Fare well dear sister I may not tarry
Look ye of youth have the tuycyon
That he fall not into vaynglory
And that ye puruey for him shortly
That he may wedde the fair dame clennesse
Which for her love have been in duresse
With that dame Sapyence down went
In to her place that was the doctrynall
Of famous clerks in conning splendent
A myrrour of lernyng that was dyuynall
With all the crafts artyfycyall
Before her dame Fortune went to her mancyon
And eke dame hardynes to her habytacyon
Capitulum nonum

FOrth than went dyscrecyon and I
Out of the castle into a grene
Where byrdys sange by great melody
There daunst also the fair queen
Beside a river named Ephesene
Over which we went to the other side
That was a medowe both long and wide
Long there we wandered till at the last
We came unto a right great wyldernes
By that time Phoebus was over past
Wherefore we walked in great derkenes
The which to me was a great heaviness
For Lucyna eke did her shrowde
Under a black and mysty cloud
For she was horned and no thing clear
And entered into the sign of caprycorne
Right far from phoebus fulgent speere
And not against him the crown had worn
I went up and down till on the morn
That phoebus his golden reyes did sprede
Than dyscrecyon ferther forth me led
Among thorns sharp and bestes wild
There was the lion the wolf and the bear
But I could mete another man ne child
But many serpents that did me fere
And by a sweet smelle I knew a pantere
So forth I went by long contynuaunce
Till that I saw an herber of pleasaunce
To which I took anon my way
Where that I saw a lady excellent
Riding on a goote in fresshe arraye
Right young of age and lusty of intent
Prayenge me to her for to assent
As to fulfill the flesshly pleasure
Which she desired me out of mesure
Nay said dyscrecyon that may not be
No said I in no manner of wise
To her request I will now agree
But evermore here foul lust despise
For I my selse do now advise
To keep me chaste that I may mary
Fair dame Clennes that noble lady

SO forth I went walking my iournay
Metynge a lady old and amyable
Syrtynge in a castle both fressh and gay
On an olyphauntes back in strength so stable
Which it to bear was good and able
Having in her hand a cup of gold
Set with perles right many afolde
She said she was the lady of richesse
The queen of wealth and worldely glory
Praynge me to company with her nobleness
And she than would promote me shortly
To innumerable riches and make me worthy
Where I am poor and set by naught
By her to worship I should be brought
Unto her I answered I would not so
As for to hunt in the park of pride
The which to Clennes is mortal fo
But with Dyscrecyon I will abide
Which does a wife for me provide
By whom I shall have the possessyowne
Of heavenly kingdom and great renown
So forth I went and had great travail
Without the comfort of any person
Save of dyscrecyon which did me counsel
As she went walking with me alone
Unto her I made full great moan
And lykened the wyldernes by moral scence
Unto worldely trouble by good experyence
She said the first lady that I did mete
Iclyped was dame Sensualyte
Which can well flater with words sweet
Causynge a man to fall into fragylyte
And for to haunt the carnal freylte
Which unto clennes is abhomynable
For they in work be gretely varyable
The second was pride enduyd with couetyse
A lady of right fruytles medytacyon
Delytynge greatly in the sin of auaryce
The which is cause of her dampnacyon
For she by her falls supportacyon
Blyndeth many a man's conscience
And dryueth right often fer in absence
So ferther I went till at the last
I was in a mase going in and out
There was none other way I was aghast
But forth I walked in great doubt
Now here now there and so round about
Than said unto me dame Dyscrecyon
Ye are in the besynes of worldely fastyon
Therein I trauayled by long space
Till that I met a lady glorious
Endued with virtue and great grace
To whom I said o lady precious
As ye seem to be good and virtuous
I you beseech now without delay
Unto dame Clennes to teache me the way
I Sapyence now will show to the
The right way unto fair clennes
And if thou wylt be ruled by me
Thou shall mary that noble princes
Yes that will I said than douteles
Dyscrecyon said she would be my suerte
Sapyence said none better might be
Than said dyscrecyon to dame sapyence
Welcome to us my sister dear
And I to her did humble reverence
Saying who had went to find you here
Yes she said I have been near
You often times sith my departing
And have been cause of your good gydynge
Capitulum.x.
COme on your way walk on a pace
For ye long for to have a sight
Of dame Clennes so clear a face
So goodely of body in beauty bright
That there can not be so fair a wight
So forth we walked to a river side
That ebbed and flowed at every tide
Than I saw a castle a pales royal
Bylded with marble black as the get
With glass wyndowes as clear as crystal
Which on the other side was set
No man to the castle might get
But over the water on a little bridge
Not half so broad as a house rydge
But as I cast mine eye than aside
I saw a lady wounderous fair
Demure of contenaunce without pride
That went her self for to repair
By the water side to take the air
Behold and se than said dame sapyence
Yonder is dame Clennes the sterre of excellence
Full glad was I than in my mind
For to se that flour of complacence
The sight of her did my heart bind
Ever her to love with percynge influence
Unto her I said o well of contynence
Unto your grace feign would I go
Ner lettynge of this water blo
To me she answered than again
Saying this world withouten mys
Is but a vanyte no thing certain
In the like wise as this water is
Ye can not come to me now ywys
But by that bridge that goth over
This stormy troublous and wawy water
Thereof said sapyence he shall not let
Well said Clennes be you his gyde
And dyscrecyon also for to be set
For to uphold him unto the other side
That he do not in the water slide
So to the bridge they did me led
I quacked than for fere and dread
I saw there written this lytterall sense
No man this bridge may over go
But he be pure without negligence
And steadfast in gods believe also
If he be ignorant and do not so
He must nedys into this water fall
Over the heed and be drowned with all
They led me over this bridge so peryllous
Till that I came to a preuy place
Where were written with letters glorious
This is the kingdom of great grace
No man by yonde this mark may trace
But if he be brought in by dame wisdom
If he so be he is much welcome
So forthermore yet forth we went
In to a hall that was solacyous
Made of precious stones splendent
That them to se it was right wounderous
They were there so greatly plenteuous
That the hall paued was for the nones
With none other gravel but precious stones

THere was dame Clennes that lady gent
And eke her fader the king of love
He satte in a chair right clear and excellent
At the upper end of the hall above
He sat estyll and did not remove
Gyrde with wylowes and might not se
No manner a thing in his degree
He had two wings right large and great
And his body also was naked
And a dart in his right hand was set
And a torche in his left hand brenned
A botell about his neck was hanged
His one leg armed and naked the other
Him for to se it was a wonder
Sapyence bad me meruayll no thing
For she would show me the sygnifycacyon
Why he so sat by short reckoning
According to a morylyzacyon
Now of the first to make relacyon
Love should be gyrde fast with stabylyte
Without which love can have no suerte
Love may not se but is always blind
And wenyth no man can have perseuerau^ce
Where that he loves by natural kind
But he do show him by words of vterau^ce
Trught he bewreyeth him by contenaunce
For hard it will be love so to couere
But that some man shall it perceuere
Also his nakedness does sygnyfy
That true love no thing else desires
But the very person and eke body
That he so well and feruentely loves
His wings also well betokenyth
That his mind flees unto the person
That he does love so well alone
And also love is stryken with a sharp darte
That makes a man for to complayn
When that it has wounded sore his heart
It brenneth hot like fire certain
Than love his purpose would feign atteyn
And is evermore both hoot and dry
Till his lady give him drink of mercy
His one leg is armed to defend
The right that longs unto amyte
And wrong love for to amend
His naked leg betokens charity
That is the Joy of great felycyte
So charity right love and good concord
With stablynes reygneth in this mighty lord
Capitulum.xi.
THan forth me led good dame Sapyence
Before that mighty lords mageste
Come on she said put the in presence
That thou may se dame clennes beauty
Ponder in thy mind by veryte
That so fair as she was not queen helyn
Queen Ipolyte or young Polyxyn
This lady is clean without corrupcyon
And wereth three crowns for her vyrgynyte
Due is for people of perfyt relygyon
An other for maidens keeping chastyte
The therde for true wedowes as ye maystse
I will the now to her fader present
Her for to mary if she will consent
Than said dame sapyence o noble emperor
O sovereign lord and royal potestate
O vyctoryous prince and famous conqueror
O king of love and seaser of debate
To the no creature may say chekmate
I present the now this virtuous knight
For to mary clennes your daughter bright
I thank you he said for your good will
But he that to Clennes married must be
He must my commandment first fulfill
As to scomfyte the dragon with heedes three
That is a serpent of great subtylte
Which well betokens as we do find
The world the flesh and the devil by kind
Sapyence said I should not fail
To do his commandment for Clennes sake
As for to sle the dragon in battle
That lay in a marys in a great lake
Which was much stynkynge foul and blake
Wisdom bade me be not aterde
For she would give me a shield and sword
And arm me also with fair armure
To vaynquysshe that dragon so ferse and great
She said it should be so good and sure
That I no harm of him should get
Though he his teth on me had sete
Yet should I slay him for all his might
By my great strokes when I did fight
First she my leg harneys set on
And after my plackerd of great riches
She armed me her self alone
And laced my helmet of her gentylnes
I thanked her for her great goodness
And gave me my sword and sheld also
Saying let us to the dragon go
This is the armure for the soul
That in his epystole wrote saint Poule
Good hope thy leg harneys shall be
The habergyn of ryghtwysnes gyrde with chastyte
Thy plackarde of besynes with branches of alms deed
Thy shield of believe and mekenes for the head
Thy sword shall be the to defend
The word of god the devil to blind

DAme sapyence and I did take our license
Of the king of love in virtue depured
And of his daughter shynynge in excellence
Which to me said with words assured
O virtuous knight you for me have dured
Ingrete woe and pain but think you verily
To scomfyt that dragon by wisdom shortly
Tha^n went we forth to that serpent
In merueylous travail of sorrow and bale
By that time the day right fair was spent
And phoebus his course began to auale
But at the last we came into a dale
Where we felt the sauer of a dungeon
Of the foul and stynkynge dragon
Nere to that dragon there was a way
That men used upon a fair hill
Unto high heaven so fressh and gay
But that dragon let them their will
And by the way he did them kill
Bringing them unto the dungeon
Iclyped the place of great oblyuyon
I had not be there half an hour
But that this dragon me approached
As though that he would me devour
He so fersly than on me marched
The battle between us long continued
But he had me right sone overcome
If I had not help of dame wisdom
I struck at him fast with my sword
And with my shield did me defend
Wisdom bad me not be aferde
But my stroke that for to amend
As fer as my might weld extend
So by her words I plucked up mine heart
And did than unto the dragon sterte
But he caught me than in his claws
And so we wrasteled long to gyder
But he hyld me sharply in his paws
Till wysedom my feblenesse did consider
Behold she said dame clennes yonder
Than as a side I cast all my sight
I saw that lady so pure and bright
My strength than dobeled an hundred fold
And I from him brake by virtuous prowes
My heart was warm that before was cold
With the comfortable sight of fair dame clennes
Than I to him gave strokes of exces
And with my sharpeswerde cut of anon
Two of his heedes leuynge him but one
These two heedes by good moral sens
The world and the flesh do sygnyfy
As I in scripture have intellygence
The first the world that is transytory
Lies between man and heavenly glory
Lettyuge him often of his passage
If it of him can get advantage
The second is the flesshly desire
That troubles a man right sore within
Setting his courage upon a fire
Causynge him to enclyne to dedely syn
His flessh the battle of him does wyn
Often bringing him into dampnacyon
It repentance were not his salvation
Repentance always requires mercy
And penance to god is a satisfaccyon
For god desires evermore truly
An humble heart full of contrycon
And the world desires restytucyon
Of goods that have be gotten wrongfully
To be restored unto the ryghtfull party
When I by wysedom had won the vyctory
Of these two heedes I was right glad
His third heed marched against me sharply
But I my swerd in my hand had
Strykynge at him with strokes sad
And blood of him could I draw none
For he had another flesh ne bone
But at the last I did him vaynquysshe
Dryuynge him home to his derke regyon
Of infernal pain that shall not fynysshe
For hell is called his propre mancyon
And of all other of his opinion
That do the precepts of god forsake
And to deuelyche works them do be take
God by his ryghtwysnes made a law
By which man for dedely sin is conde^pned
If god his vengeance do not withdraw
In everlasting pain he should be prysoned
But and man mercy of him required
With penytent heart he should it have
And with his mercy he will man save
Capitulum.xii.
When I had scomfyte this serpent venymous
Sapyence to me right gentely said
Blessed be god ye are so gracyous
That ye shall mary Clennes the maid
But yet er whiles ye were a frayd
Ye I said and swetfull right sore
Till ye new strength did me restore
This battle was great and long endured
Which caused me to be right weary
But sapyence with her words me mured
With walls of comfort making me merry
Come on she said and walk on lightly
Unto the castle that we come fro
I answered to her I would do so
Than forth we went a great pace
Till that we came to the castle side
There met us ladies with great solace
And welcomed us at the same tide
So fair a sort in the world so wide
May not be found by no manner of reason
As I saw there at the same season
The first lady that did us mete
I clyped was dame perseueraunce
Which to me said with words sweet
Blessed be god of your good governance
That has kept you from the incomberaunce
Of the serpent with the heedes three
And caused you vyctor of him to be
Than came dame faith that lady glorious
Welcome she said with words amyable
I am right glad ye ar so vyctoryous
Of that foul dragon so abhomynable
She said that I was evermore stable
In her in deed eke word and thought
Or else my labor had been to naught
Than spoke the lady fair dame charity
Welcome virtue the noble veteran
Sythens that ye always have loved me
From the first season that ye began
Both in your youth and sith ye were man
Ye have had me in humble reverence
And have been ruled by my preemynence
Than said dame prayer in my presence
Ye never cast me in oblyuyaunce
By no sloth nor wordely negligence
But have had me in great remembrance
Which has been to me very great pleasaunce
Wherefore welcome virtue my dear
Unto this castle that yese here
Than came fast to me dame lowelynes
Clyppynge me hard with lovely chere
Bidding me welcome with great gladness
As by her contenau^ce it did well appear
Come on she said and walk on nere
So than among these fair ladies all
I went in to the great castle hall
And there met me dame clennes blyue
And dame grace bare up her train
Which ever to her was affyrmatyue
From whom dame clennes might not refrain
Than said she to me I am right feign
That ye ar comen in to this place
Where ye shall wedde me in short space
Upon my kne I kneled than down
Saying o sterre of the bliss eterne
O well of virtue and of great renown
O dyuyne comfort most sempyterne
When I your beautye do so well decerne
Ye set mine heart upon a brennynge fire
With fervent love to come to my desire
To me she answered in this wise
O my dear heart my spouse so pure
Why do ye not on your fete arise
You of my true love shall be sure
For ye my heart have now in cure
Let us go now to our fader reuerente
So forth unto him than we went
When that we came before his fair face
Dame clennes made curtelye unto the ground
Saying of ader king of great grace
This knight to love ye are now bound
And so am I for I have often found
Great kyndnes on him both night and day
For he has loved me right well always
Welcome he said right noble knight
How have ye done sythens your departing
Have ye scomfyted with your might
The merueylous dragon so greatly stynkynge
Ye I said with the power shynynge
Of my maystresse good dame sapyence
I did him vaynquysshe by her experyence
Where is dame Sapyence than said he
And eke her sister dame dyscrecyon
Sir I said they are comen with me
And they have had me in iurisdyccyon
Syns my departing without destruccyon
Than spoke dame sapyence by her faculte
Unto that mighty lords mageste
Saying this knight than cleped virtue
Has loved your daughter by long contynuau^ce
With stable love so faithful and true
And for her sake has put to vteraunce
The three heeded dragon by wise puruyaunce
Wherefore me think he ought to mary
Your daughter Clennes that noble lady
The king said me think the same
If that my daughter will agree
And she do not she much is to blame
Considering his wisdom and great beauty
Come hyder he said my daughter fre
To be wife to virtue will ye consent
Ye fader she said with hole intent
Than he called unto his presence
Perseueraunce charity and fydelyte
With lowlynes prayer and intellygence
Showing unto them the certeynte
How clennes his daughter wedded shall be
Unto me now virtue in all godely have
By fore that three days be right fully past
He called me than to his magnyfycence
Bidding me go to bed and to rest
In the chaumbre of clean conscience
Than so to do I thought it the best
For phoebus was turned into the west
So sapyence and I went forth to bed
For lake of rest oppressed was my head
A little welp within this chaumbre was
That lay waking and barked always
That no man in to it should pass
That would with conscience make a fray
I did sleep there till that it was day
Than up I rose and made me ready
Calling unto me dame sapyence shortly
Saying unto her o lady and maystres
O comfortable salve unto every sore
O fontayne of wealth and carbuncle of clernes
Without ye help me I am forlore
Wherefore I show you as now before
Without I mary fair dame clennes
I shall endure in mortal heaviness
Thereof said she be no thing adred
For ye shall mary here right soon
By me your matter shall be well sped
And the same day it shall be done
About the hour truly of noone
And there shall be at your good dinner
Charity faith penance and prayer
Dame sapyence led me into a gardeyn
Where Clennes was among flowers sweet
Her to repair without dysdeyn
As I to her went she did me mete
Bringing me a flower called the margarete
Which is a flower right sweet and precious
Endued with beauty and much virtuous
This flower I kyst often right swetely
Setting it nere unto my heart
Dame Clennes looked upon me lovely
Saying that I should not depert
Till she had showed me a great covert
So with her I went without delay
Where birds sat on many a spray
By this time phoebus had begone
His ascencyall course in great bryghtnes
In to the sign of the fierous lion
Exylynge the fenerous frosty coldness
And depryuynge the noxyall derkenes
And also setherus his fragraunt breath
Dystylled had upon every heth
Than to her I said my lady dear
Behold this weder so clear and fair
How royal walking that it is here
Like a place of pleasure you to repair
Among the flowers so sweet of air
An other she had as she me told
Bryghter than phoebus a thousand fold
This is a place of recreacyon
My mind to comfort after study
In wealth pleasure and delectacyon
For if I should my self apply
Ever to pray to god an hye
Without this place I may not be sure
An other time in prayer to endure
But the other gardyn is celestyall
That longs to us by enherytaunce
And is entayled to us in general
For our clean life and virtuous governance
Who that us loves without doubtauu^ce
With us shall go to eternal glory
In short space or else to purgatory
Than forth we went to her fader royal
Which welcomed us by great humylyte
Saying my daughter dear and special
Ye shall this day by great solempnyte
Be wedded to virtue with benygnyte
We kneled down and thanked his grace
And than forth we went to an other place
Capitulum.xiii.

IN to a chapel gayly gloryfyed
And also hanged with cloth of tyssue
A place it was right greatly deyfyed
The roof was set with stones of virtue
As with rubyes and emeraudes bright of hue
The rood loft was yuery garnysshed with gold
Set with dyamoundes right many a fold
There I did se the ark of god
With many saints that suffered martyrdom
And also I saw there Moses rod
And saint Austyn that brought crystendom
Into england by his great wysedom
And the xii. apostles that fast began write
Of our believe and eke did endyte
There was saint peter the noble pope
That did stand on the right side
Of the high auter in a rich cope
Dame clennes and I did there abide
And up there came than at that tide
Dame prayer with her sister charity
And eke dame penytence with humylyte
Than came dame faith anon to us
With ryghtwysenes peace and dame mercy
With dame contrycyon gay and glorious
Which after them did not long tarry
And than came bid and eke saint gregory
With saint ambrose the noble doctor
Which of our faith was good protector
Than came the king of fervent love
Led with argos in goodely wise
Without whom he might not remove
From his sete by right prudent gyse
Who loves argos will not deuyse
Nor yet begin no manner of thing
Without in his mind hese good ending
Also saint Jerome the noble cardynall
Came up to us by humble reverence
Which evermore was a good doctrynall
Prechynge to us by virtuous influence
With exhortacyon of dyuyne complacence
And than four bysshoppes in great dygnyte
Right conning cernynge unto the deyte
On him waited by great dylygence
And never did forsake his company
But him obeyed by good experyence
And from his commandment did not vary
But in the chapel they did there tarry
And than saint Jerome went to the king
Of fervent love unto him saying
O amyable king seasour of debate
O ioyner of virtue and well of unity
O royal emperor o sovereign estate
O messenger of fervent amyte
O fervent dart of cordyall pryuyte
Here is your daughter fair dame clennes
That must be married with good ryghtwysenes
Unto virtue the lovely knight
Which the battle now has won
By dame sapyence help and might
Of the foul three heeded dragon
This marriage by me shall be don
Go ye now straight into your tabernacle
Which is to you most propre habytacle
Than the sovereign king to him did call
Dame faith dyscrecyon and dame sapyence
With dame contrycyon and charity withal
And eke dame mercy and dame penytence
Unto them saying ye have intellygence
That this day clennes my daughter dear
Shall be married to virtue that ye se here
Than they did all come unto me
With dame peace and dame grace
And after them came dame virgynyte
Which in her arms did me enbrace
Saying that I was to her great solace
Gyuynge me unto my good marriage
A gown of silver for great aparage
She gafe an other of the same
Unto dame clennes putting it one
Upon her back withouten blame
After which Clennes went anon
Unto her fader her self alone
And I with saint Jerome did there tarry
To wed dame Clennes that noble lady
And all the ladies with meke contenence
Stood on a rewe beside the closette
Of Clennes fader without resystence
Which hanged was gayly with blue velvet
And with perles and rubyes rychely set
Than forth came Clennes with two angels led
Which their golden wings abroad did spread
Dame grace after her bare up her trayn
And.xv. ladies her did ensue
First went dame humylyte certain
And after her than did pursue
Dame faith in stablenes so true
Ledynge with her the fair dame pease
That wealth and riches does well increase
Than went dame reason with perseuerau^ce
And than dame mercy with contricyon
And than exersyce with remembrance
After whom went dame restytucyon
With dame prayer and dame confession
And dame charity with obedyence
And after them came fair dame abstynence
Saint Jerome did make there coniunccyon
Of dame Clennes and me in matrimonye
With heavenly words and virtuous fastyon
And angels came down from heaven hye
As saint Mychell with gabryell and the gerachye
To help saint peter the mass to sing
The organs went and the bellys did ring
My pen for feebleness may not now write
Nor my tongue for domnes may not express
Nor my mind for negligence may not endyte
Of the aungelycall Joy and sweet gladness
That I saw there without heaviness
And when this wedding holy was fynysshed
The angels than to heaven vanysshed
Than down I went in to the hall
Where ordained was by great solempnyte
A dinner of virtue most celestyall
To which came my wife full of benygnyte
On the one side led by good auctoryte
With saint Edmond the noble king
And martyr which did her down bring
And she was led on the other side
With saint Edward the king and confessor
And so between them went this bryde
To whom all the ladies made great honor
As always serving her without error
And a little while anon after her
Ergos brought down her noble fader
The king of love than sat him down
At the table for that time to ette
Causynge dame Clennes for her renown
On his one side than for to be set
And I on the other without any let
And beside me sapyence and dyscrecyon
And than by them sat dame contrycyon
Than sat saint Edward with vyrgynyte
And before him sat dame obedyence
Saint Edmond and dame charity
And than dame prayer with dame abstynence
And than dame faith shynynge in excellence
With saint Jerome and saint Austeyn
And than saint gregory without dysdeyn
There was two angels holding fast
The table cloth at every end
Knelynge down humbly and steadfast
Whose service no man could amend
Other there were that did entende
Us for to serve with their great dylygence
That in them found could be no negligence
There did saint Peter by great holiness
Serve us of our sweet lords body
First he served the fader of clennes
And after that he served her shortly
With charity faith and dame mercy
And I with dyscrecyon and dame sapyence
Of saint Peter was served with great indulgence
So dame obedyence with contrycyon
With saint Edward and virgynyte
In likewise were served without corrupcyon
And saint Edmond with dame charity
And saint Jerome with dame humylyte
With saint austyn and saint gregory
What need I longer of them specyfy
This was a fest most sweet and precious
To feed the soul with dyuyne comfort
This was a mete most dear and glorious
That causes all man for to resort
To sempyternall life and comfort
Than saint ambrose being dyuyne
After our mete gafe us good wine
By this time was I.lx. year old
And desired for to live in peace
For I began to grow two fold
And my feebleness did sore encreace
For nature her strength than did sea^ce
Wherefore after this ghoostly fest
I thought with my wife to abide in rest
And I to her said with loving chere
O my sweet spouse most fair and beauteous
To me ever right leyfe and dear
Where is your land that is solacyous
Ye showed me of your gardeyn glorious
Unto which now feign would I go
There for to dwell and you also
Sir she said the angel raphaell
Shall with these martyrs and noble confessors
Bring you thither with them to dwell
Where ye shall see all your progenytours
With many saints and glorious auctours
This land is heaven that to us longs
As our euydence the gospel tells
Than came my fader in law to us
Saying by right I did combynd
Clennes my daughter with virtue precious
And you must I love by naturell kind
For on you now is all my mind
Before him I kyst my wife most swetely
For we loved to gyder hot and truly
Than came my good angel to me
Causynge me with him for to go
With clennes my wife where I did se
The pains of hell full of great woe
There was the dragon that I did slo
Bound with chains in fire infynall
With the seven dedely sins in general
Than my good angel to me said
If ye had loved dame sensualyte
The which with you did make a brayde
Ye had been dampened by right and equity
In to this pytte full of all iniquyte
Wherefore thank god that sent you wisdom
Such deedly perils for to overcome
Also the lady with the cup of gold
Is here condemned for her great pride
In endeles pain both hot and cold
Where in for sin she shall abide
This is a dongeon long and wide
Made for them that do sin dedely
And of christ Ihesu will axe no mercy
This is a place full of all derkenes
Wherein be serpents foull and odyous
This is a place of mortal heaviness
Where I saw deuyles black and tedyous
Dampened souls turmented with hokes rygorous
This is the vppermoost part of hell
In which paynyms dampened do dwell
For as much as they lacked instruccyon
For to be leave in god omnypotent
They have deserved the less correccyon
Yet their pain have none extinguysshement
For they are dampened by true sentyment
For their believe and falls idolatry
That made their gods of mars and mercury
Than went we down to an othet vaute
Where Jews lay in great pains strong
Whom deuylles tourmented by great assaute
Drawing them with hokes a long
For their opinion so falls and wrong
Which byleued not in the natyuyte
Of Ihesu christ and the vyrgyn Mare
Nor yet that he did suffer passion
Both for them and all mankind
Another yet of his resurreccyon
In their believe they are so blind
Yet as in books written we do find
That they have been taught many a time
For to forsake their own falls crime
Than went we down to a depper vale
Where christian souls did weppe and cry
In great sorrow pain and bale
Brennynge in fire most hot and dry
And some in Ice right deep did lie
For to express it is impossyble
The pains there they are so horrible
These christian men know gods law
And every day had informacyon
From deuelysshe works them to withdra^we
That they should not fall in dampnacyon
Yet will they not make sequestracyon
Of gods commandment but syn deedly
Therefore here are they dampened right wysey
And thou had set thy delectacyon
In flesshely pleasure and vain glory
Thou had ben here without salvation
Without thou of god had axed mercy
Who that it axeth shall have it truly
If he be contryt and do repent
That he his life in ill has spent
This place sythens it is most heavy
Most derke and most far from lyghtnes
As philosophers afferme by astronomy
Is in the mids of the earth doutles
That is a place of dyssolate derkenes
Wherefore by reason it must needs be set
In the mids of the earth both long and grette
Capitulum.xiiii
My good angel by his great virtue
Showed me all this in a short space
And after him I did than pursue
With my wife unto the fair place
That we came fro full of all solace
Where was my fader in the company
Of many saints that did there tarry
My wife and me than for to bring
To the place of eternal glory
With heavenly tewnes swetely singing
That them to here it was great melody
More than any tongue can specyfy
This was their song so sweet and glorious
That they did sing with voice so virtuous
O celestyall king one two and three
All people praise the god and lord
Which art in heaven o noble trynyte
Whose royal power and miserycorde
Confermed is by thyn hye accord
On us with troth for to endure
Withouten end as we are sure
Glory be to the fader almighty
And to the sone and to the holy ghoost
Three persons and one god truly
Whose power never can be loost
For he is lord of myghtes most
And so has been without beginning
And ever shall be without ending
When we were in the air of asure
There did us mete the noble Ierarchy
As Cherubyn and Seraphyn so pure
With other angels in their company
That did proclayme and sing on hye
With voice insacyat most melodyous
To god above Sanctus sanctus sanctus
There did I se the planettes seven
Move in order by alteracyon
To merueylous for me to neuen
For they seassed not their operacyon
Some assended some made declynacyon
Entering their houses of the.xii. synes
Some indyrectly and some by dyrecte lines
To heaven we styed a place most glorious
Where that we did behold the deyte
With insaciable contenaunce most defyrous
And truly than the more that we
Did look upon his sovereign beauty
The more our desire did encreace
This is a Joy that shall not seace
This is a regyon most full of swetnes
This is a realm of delectacyon
This is a land of infenyte gladness
Without any stormy tribulacyon
This place is of eterne salvation
Where angels and saints for their solace
Evermore do look on gods face
What should I write things of dyuynyte
Or endyght of such matters hye
Sythen it no thing longs to my faculte
Therefore of it I will not longer tarry
For fere that I in it should varye
And by cause that troth shall be my mede
I will now leave and take me to my creed
So virtue and clennes by good right
Truly in marriage joined must be
For they love to gyder with all their might
Without dyscencyon or duplycyte
And they both are always in unity
To whom heaven by tayll general
Entayled is by a deed memoryall
Now are they to gyder to heaven gone
There for to dwell in Joy eternal
Where that there is the heavenly trone
Of our savior Ihesu dear and special
Who that him loves truly over all
Ledynge his life with virtue and clennes
Shall come unto the glory endeles
But in the fynysshynge of my matter
To god the maker of all thing
Deuoutely now I make my prayer
To saufe king Henry our ryghtfull king
From all treason and doleful morning
And for to maynteyn the great honor
Of this sweet read rose so fair a color
This flower was kept right long in close
Among the leuys holsom and sote
And regally sprange and arose
Out of the noble stoke and rote
Of the read rose tree to be our bote
After our bale sent by great grace
On us to reygne by right long space
O lord god what Joy was this
Unto his mother so good and gracyous
When that she saw her sone I wys
Of his ennemys to be so vyctoryous
It caused her to be most Joyous
And yet there of no wonder why
For he was right long from her truly
A joyful metynge than between
The mother and the sone so dear
A day of gladness bright and shene
Fressher than phoebus myddaye spear
When her sone to us did appear
He did us light with his pure bemys
Quenchynge of mars the fyrous lemys
O heavenly king o eternal emperor
O three persons and one god equal
I pray the to keep from all doloure
This mother with her sone in special
With all their noble buddes in general
And laud be to the that did enhaunce
Him to his right and propre herytaunce
The white rose that with tempests troublous
Aualed was and eke blown aside
The reed rose fortyfyed and made delycyous
It pleased god for him so to provide
That his redolent buddes shall not slide
But ever increase and be vyctoryous
Of fatal brerys which he contraryous
Thus god by grace did well combyne
The read rose and the white in marriage
Being oned right clear does shine
In all clennes and virtuous courage
Of whose right and royal lynage
Prince Henry is spronge our king to be
After his fader by right good equity
O noble prince Henry our second treasure
Surmontynge in virtue and myrour of beauty
O geme of gentylnes and lantern of plasure
O rubycound blossom and sterre of humylyte
O famous bud full of benygnyte
I pray to god well for to increase
Your high estate in rest and pease
O thoughfull heart for lack of conning
Now laid to sleep this long wynters night
Rise up again look on the shynynge
Of fair lucyna clear and bright
Behold eke mercury with his fair light
Caslynge a down his stremys merry
It may well glad thyn emyspery
O go were fountain most aromatyke
I the now lake for to depure
My rudnes with thy lusty retoryke
And also I mys as I am sure
My master Chaucers to take the cure
Of my pen for he was expert
In eloquent terms subtle and covert
Where is now lydgate flourynge in sentence
That should my mind forge to endyte
After the terms of famous eloquence
And strength my pen well for to write
With matters fresshe of pure delight
They can not help me there is no remedy
But for to pray to god almighty
For to dystyll the dew of influence
Upon my brayn so dull and rude
And to enlumyn me with his sapyence
That I my rudnes may exclude
And in my matter well to conclude
Unto thy pleasure and to the reders all
To whom I excuse me now in general
