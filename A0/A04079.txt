AN Act for the grant of one entier Subsidy by the Temporaltie.

DVBLIN. Imprinted by John Franckton Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty Anno 1615.

An Act for the grant of one entier Subsidy by the Temporaltie.
THis your Majesty's Realm of Ireland most dread and gracious Sovereign has
in former times been subject to so many miseries, as that it has been a
continual burden to the Crown of England without yielding any retribution or
returning of any commodity or profitt to the same. And albeit infinite Treasures
have been from time to time expended in and upon this Kingdom, yet did it
never thereby become more rich and wealthy, but continued in want and penury,
as it was before: The true cause whereof did arise from the great and long
discentions and troubles which did waste and depopulate the whole Land, made
all possessions uncertain, and disabled the Subjects to improoue the
commodities of the same: But forasmuch as since the beginning of your Majesty's
most happy Reign, all the causes of war, discention and coffeehouse, are
taken away by the rooting out of many wicked and ungrateful Traitors, by
receiving all the Irishry into your gracious Protection, by settling of your
Subjects estates in their Lands, by your Commissions for Surrendors, and
defective Titles, by securing their lives, as well by general as particular
Pardons, by remitting many great arrears of Rents mean profits, and
forfeitures, by confirming and enlarging the Privileges of your Cytties and
Towns Corporate, by establishing the Circuits and visitations of Justice
throughout the Kingdom: And lastly by the Plantation of ^lster with British
Colonies, your Majesty now being in the absolute and peaceable possession of
this your Vineyard, and having cleared it from the thorns and briars of
Rebellion, fenced it as well with the Law as with the Sword, and planted it
with so many Civil Subjects of England and Scotland, may now justly expect
some fruit thereof: And therefore we your Majesty's most loyal and loving
Subjects assembled in this present Parliament most gratefully acknowledging
that we have received from your Majesty these inestimable benefits before
expressed, do with all duty and humble affection present unto your Highness
one entyer Subsidy, most humbly beseeching your Majesty to accept thereof, as
the first fruits of this your poor Kingdom of Ireland: and to that end we
humbly beseech your Majesty that it may be enacted.

And be it enacted by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in
this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that your
Highness, your Heirs and Successors, shall have and receive one entyer Subsidy
