THat God that dyed for us all,
And drank both vinegar and gall,
bring us out of bale:
And give them both good life and long
Which listen do unto my song,
or tend unto my tale.
There dwelt a man in my Country
Which in his life had wives three:
a bless^ng full of joy:
By the first wife a son he had,
Which was a pretty sturdylad,
a good unhappy boy.
His Father loved him well,
But his stepmother never a dell,
I tell you as I think:
All things she thought lost by the Rood
Which to the boy did any good,
as either meat or drink,
And yet I wis it was but bad,
Nor half enough thereof he had,
but ever more the worst,
And therefore evil might she fare,
That did the little boy such care,
so far forth as she durst.
Unto the man the wife began say,
I would you would put this boy away,
and that right soon in have,
Truly he is a cursed lad.
I would some other man him had
that would him better chaste.
Then said the good man dame not so
I will not let the young boy go,
he is but re^ber of age,
He shall with me this year abide,
till he be grown more strong and tried
for to win better wage.
We have a man a sturdy lout
which keeps our neat the fields about
and sleeps all the day,
He shall come home as god me shield,
And the boy shall into the field,
to keep them if he may.
Then said the wife in verament
Husband thereto I give concent,
for that I think it need:
On the morrow when it was day
The litte boy went on his way
unto the field with speed,
Of no man he took any care,
But song heyho away the mare,
much mirth he did pursue,
Forth he went with might and maine,
Until he came unto the plain,
where he his dinner drew.
But when he saw it was so bad,
Full little list there to he had,
but put it up from sight,
Saying he had no list to taste,
But that his hunger still should last
till he came home at night:
And as the boy sat on a hill,
There came an old man him until,
was walking by the way:
Son he said, God thee see,
Now welcome Father may ye be
the little boy began say.
The old man said I hunger sore
Then have thou any meat in store,
which thou might give to m^?
The Child's ropli'de, so God me save,
To such poor victuals as I have,
right welcome shall you be.
Of this the old man was full glad,
The boy drew forth such as he had,
and said go to gladly:
The old man east was to please,
He eat and made himself at ease,
saying, Son gramercy,
Son he said thou have given meat to me,
And I will give three things to thee,
what ere thou will entreat:
Thensaid the boy it is best I trow,
That you bestow on me a Bow,
with which I birds may get.
A Bow my Son I will thee give,
Such as shall last while thou do live,
was never Bow more fit:
For if thou shoot therein all day,
Waking or winking, or any way,
the mark thou still shall hit.
Now when the Bow in hand he felt,
And Arrows had under his belt,
heartily he laughed Iwis:
And said had I a Pipe withal,
Though nere so little or so small,
I then had all my wish,
A Pipe Son thou shall hane also,
That in true music so shall go,
I put thee out of dout,
As who that lives, and shall it hear,
Shall have no power to forbear,
but laugh and leap about.
Now tell me what the third shall be,
For three things I will give to thee,
as I have said before:
The Boy then smiling, answer made,
I have enough for my poor trade,
I will desire no more.
The old man said my troth is plight,
Thou shall have all I thee behight,
say on now let me see:
At home I have (the Boy replide)
A cruel Step-dame full of pride,
who is most cursed to me.
When meat my Father gives to me,
She wishes poison it might be,
and stareth in my face:
Now when she gazeth on me so
I would she should a ray let go
which might ring through the place.
The old man answered then anon,
When ere she looks thy face upon,
her tail shall wind the horn:
So loudly, that who shall it hears,
Shall not be able to forbear
but laugh her unto scorn,
So farewell son the old man cride,
God keep you sir the boy replide,
I take my lean of thee:
God that best of all things may
Keep thee safe both night and day,
gramercy son said he.
When it grew near upon the night,
Jack well prepared hide home full right
it was his ordinanee,
And as he went his pipe did blow,
The whilst his Cattle on a row
about him began to dance.
Thus to the Town he pipt full trim,
His skipping beasts did follow him
into his Fathers close?
He went and put them up each one,
Which done, be homeward went anon
to's Fathers Hall he goes.
His Father at his supper sat,
And little Jack espide well that,
and said to him anon:
Father, all day I kept your Neat,
At night I pray you give me meat,
I Am hungry by S. John,
Meatles I have lien all the day,
and kept your beasts, they did not stray,
my diuner was but ill:
His Father took a Capons wing,
And at the boy he did it fling,
bidding him eat his fill.
This grieved his stepdames heart full sore
Who loathed the lad still more and more:
she star'd him in the face:
With that she let go such ablast,
As made the people all aghast,
it sounded through the place.
Each one did laugh and make good game,
But the cursed wife grew red for shame,
and wished she had been gone:
Pardy (the boy said) well I wot,
That Gun was both well chargd and st^ot,
and might have broke a stone.
Full curstly she looked on him thoe,
That look an other crack let go
which did a thunder raise:
Quoth the boy did you ever see
A woman let her pellets flee
more thick and more at ease?
Fie said the boy unto his dame,
Temper thy tel-tale bum for shame,
which made her full of sorrow:
Dame said the good man go thy way,
For why I swears by night nor day
thy gear is not to borrow.
Now afterward as you shall hear,
Unto the house there came a Friar,
and lay there all the night:
The wife this Friar lou'de as a Saint,
And to him made a great complaint,
of Iackes most vile despite.
We have quoth she within Iwis,
A wicked Boy, none shrewder is,
which does me mighty eat:
I dare not look upon his face,
Or hardly tell my shamfull case,
so stlthily I fare.
For Gods love meet the boy to morrow,
Beat him well and give him sorrow,
and make him blind or same:
The Friar swore he would hint beat,
The wife prayed him not to forget,
the Boy did her much shame.
Some Witch quoth she he is I smell,
But quoth the Friar I Will beat him well,
of that take you no care:
I Will teach him wite-craft if I may,
O quoth the wife do so I pray,
lay on and do not spare.
Early next morn the Boy arose
And to the field full soon he goes,
his Cattle for to drive:
The Friar then up as early gate,
He was afraid to come too late,
he ran full fast and blithe.
But when he came upon the land,
He found where little Jack did stand
keeping his deasts alone:
Now Boy he said God give thee shame
What have thou done to thy Step-dame
tell me forthwith anon.
And if thou can not quit thee well,
I Will beat thee till thy body swell,
I will no longer bide:
The Boy replied what ayleth thee?
My Stepdame is as well as ye,
what need you thus to chide?
Come will you see mine arrowe fly,
And hit yon small bird in the eye
and other things withal?
Sir Friar though I have little wit,
Yet yonder Bird I mean to hit
and give her you I shall.
There sat a small Bird on a bryer,
Shoot shoot you wag then said the Friar
for that I long to see:
Jack hit the Bird upon the head,
So right, that she fell down for dead,
no further could she flee.
Fast to the bush the Friar went,
And up the Bird in hand he hent,
much wondering at the chance:
Mean while Jack took his pipe and played
So loud the Friar grew mad apaid,
and fell to skip and dance.
No sooner was the pipes sound heard
But Bedlani like he bounst and fared,
and leapt the bush about:
The sharp briers scracht him by the face,
And by the breech, and other place,
that fast the blood ran out.
It tare his clothes down to the skirt,
His cope, his cool, and linen shirt,
and every other weed:
The thorns this while were rough and thick
And did his privy members prick,
that fast they began to bleed.
Jack as he piped laughed among,
The Friar with briars was vildly stung,
he hopped wondrous hye:
At last the Friar held up his hand,
And said I can no longer stand,
oh I shall dancing dye.
Gentle Jack thy Pipe hold still,
And here I vow for good nor ill
to do thee any woe:
Jack laughing to him thus replide,
Friar ship out on the other side,
thou have free leave to go.
Out of the bush the Friar then went,
All martyrd, ragged, scratcht and rent,
and torn on every side;
Hardly on him was left a clout,
To wrap his belly round about,
his harlotry to hide.
The thorns had scratcht him by the face,
On hands, on thighs, and every place,
he was all bath ^ in blood,
So much, that who the Friar did se,
For fear of him, were feign to flee,
thinking he had been wood.
When to the good wife home he came,
He made no bragges for very shame
to see his clothes rent all:
Much sorrow in his heart he had,
And every man did guess him mad
when he was in the Hall.
The good wife said where have thou been?
Sure in some evil place I ween,
by sight of thine array:
Dame (said he) I came from thy Son,
The Devil and he has me undone,
no man him conquer may.
With that, the goodman he came in,
The wife set on her madding pin,
cride, here is a foul array:
Thy Son that is thy life and dear,
Has almost slain the holy Friar,
alas and well away.
The good man said benediciti,
What has the bilde boy done to thee,
now tell me without let?
The devil him take the Friar then said,
Homade m^ dance despite my head,
among the Thorns, the hey go bef.
The good man said unto him tho,
Father, had thou been murdered so,
it had bens deadly sin:
The Friar to him made this reply,
The Pipe did sound so merrily
that I could never blin.
Now when it grew to almost night,
Jack the Boy came home sull right,
as he was wont to do:
But when he came into the Hall,
Full soon his Father did him call,
and bad him come him to.
Boy he said, come tell me here,
What have thou done unto this Friar,
lie not in any thing
Father he said, now by my birth,
I played him but a fit of mirth,
and pipte him up a spring.
That Pipe said's Father would I hear
Now God forbid cride out the Friar,
his hands he then did wring:
You shall (the boy said) by Gods grace,
The Friar replide woe, and alas,
making his sorrows ring.
For Gods love said the wretched Friar,
And if you will that strange Pipe hear,
bind me fast to a post:
For sure my fortune thus I read,
If dance I do I am but dead,
my woeful life is lost.
Strong ropes they took both sharp and round
And to the poast the Friar they bound
in the middle of the hall:
All they which at the Table sat,
Laughed and made good sport thereat,
saying Friar thou can not fall.
Then said the goodman to the boy,
Jack pipe me up some merry toy,
pipe freely when thou will:
Father, the boy said verily,
You shall have mirth enough and glee;
till you bid me be still.
With that his pipe he quickly hent,
And pipte, the whilst in verament,
each Creature began to dance:
Lightly they skipt and leapt about,
Yerking their legs now in, now out,
striving aloft to prance.
The good man as in sad despair
Leapt out, and through, and ore his chair,
no man could caper hier:
Some others leapt quite ore the stocks
Some start at strawes and fell ore blocks
some wallowed in the fire.
The good man made himself good sport
To see them dance in this mad sort,
the good-wife sat not still:
But as she danst the looked on Jack,
And fast her tail did do^^le each crack,
loud as a water-mill.
The Friar this while was almost lost,
He knocked hi^ pate against the poast,
'twas then his dancing grace,
The rope rubd him under the chinne,
That the blood ran from his tatterd skin,
in many a naked place.
Jack pip^ng ran into the street,
They followed him with nimble feet,
having no power to stay:
And in their have the door did crack,
Each tumbling over his fellows back
unmindful of their way.
The neighbors that were dwelling by,
Hearing the pipe so merrily,
came dancing to the gate:
Some leapt ore doors, some ore the hatch
No man would stay to draw the latch,
but thought he came too late.
Some sick or sleeping in their bed,
As they by chance lift up their head,
were with the pipe awaked:
Straight forth they start through doors ^ locks
Some in their shirts some in their smocks
and some stark belly naked.
When all were gathered round about,
There was a bilde unruly rout
that danced in the street:
Of which some lame that could not go^
Striving to leap did tumble so,
they dancst on hands and feet.
Jack tired with sport said now I Will rest,
Do (quoth his Father) I hold it best,
thou cloyst me with this cheer:
I pray thee boy now quiet sit,
In faith this was the merriest sit
I heard this seven year.
All those that dancing thither came
Laughed heartily and made good game,
yet some got many a fall:
Thou cursed boy cried out the Friar,
Here I do summon thee to appear
before the Official:
Look thou be there on Friday next,
I Will meet thee then though now perplexed,
for to ordain thy sorrow:
The boy replide, I make a vow,
Friar I Will appear as soon as thou,
if Friday were to morrow.
But friday came as you shall hear,
Iackes step-dame and the dancing Friar
together they were met:
And other people a great pace,
Flockt to the Court to hear each case,
the Official was set.
Much civil matters were to do,
More Libels read then one or two,
both against Priest and Clarke:
Some there had testaments to prove,
Some women there through wanton love
which got strokes in the dark.
Each Procter there did plead his case
When forth did step Friar Topias,
and Iackes step-dame also:
Sir Official aloud said he,
I have brought a wicked boy to thee
has done me mighty woe:
He is a Witch as I do fear,
In Orleance he can find no pear,
this of my troth I know.
He is a Devil (quoth the wife)
And almost has bereaved my life
at that, her tail did blow,
So loud, the assembly laughed thereat,
And said her pistols crack was flat,
the charge was all amiss:
Dame (quoth. the gentle Official)
Proceed and tell me forth thy tale,
an do not let for this.
The wife that feared another crack,
Stood mute, and nere a word she spoke,
shame put her in such dread:
Ha (said the Friar) right angerly,
Knave this is all still long of thee,
now evil may thou speed.
The Friar said, sir Official,
This wicked boy will ve^e us all,
unless you do him chaste:
Sir, he has yet a pipe, truly,
Will make you dance and leap full hie,
and break your heart at last,
The Official replide perdie,
Such a pipe I feign would see,
and what mirth it can make:
Now God forbid replide the Friar,
That ere we should that vilde pipe h^are
ere I my way hence take.
Pipe on Jack (said the Official)
And let me hear thy cunning all.
Jack blew his pipe full loud,
That every man start up and dancst,
Procters and Priests, and Somners pran^t
and all in that great crowd,
Over the desks the Official ran,
And hopt upon the Table, that
straight iumpt unto the flore:
That Friar that danst as fast as he
Met him midway, and dangerously
broake eithers face full sore.
The Register leapt from his pen,
And hopt into the throng of men,
his Inke-horne in his hand:
Which swinging round about his head,
pome he struck blind, some almost dead,
some they could hardly stand.
The Procters slung their Bills about:
The good-wiues tail gave many a shout,
perfuming all the mirth:
He Somners as they had been wood
eapt ore the forms and seats a good,
and wallowed on the earth.
Renches that for their Penance came,
nd other meeds of worldly shame,
danst every one as fast:
ach set upon a mercy pin,
ome brok^ their heads, and some their shin
and some their noses brast.
he official thus sore turmoild,
^lfe swelt with sweat and almost spoild,
cride to the wanton child,
To pipe no more within that place,
But stay the sound even for Gods grace,
and love of Parie mild.
Jack said, As you will it shall be,
Provided I may hence go free,
and no man do me wrong.
Neither this woman nor this Friar,
Nor any other creature here,
he answered him anon:
Jack, I to thee my promise plight,
In thy defense I mean to fight,
and will oppose thy fone.
Jack ceast his pipe then all still stood,
Some laughing hard, some raging wood,
so parted at that tide:
Tho Official and the Somner,
The step dame, and the wicked Friar,
with much joy, mirth, and pride.
FINIS.
