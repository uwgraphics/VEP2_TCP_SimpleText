THE WRATH of God against SINNERS.
ROMANS 1.18. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness
and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.


IN the fore going verses, the holy Apostle, by way of Preface; prepares way
for (...) truth that he would deliver, and the doctrine he purposed to
dispense of, and that all cavils might be removed; and that the Word of God
might take deeper root and better acceptance, he^ uses these three particulars;

R^^ans, therefore he oug^ to pay it; and now way b^ing made, he comes to
(...) ^aine point, that is, That a ^an is not justified by doing, ^ut by
believing, and this ^e confirms; first by the

Secondly, by force of Argument,

First, In the Text observe the dealing of wicked m^ with the truth of God, the
hold the truth of God in u^righteousnesse.

Secondly, Gods deali^ with them, they dealt roug^ly with the truth, they la^
violent hands on it, and G^ he deals as rigorously wi^ them.

And the reason w^ they hold down the trut^ is, because of some lust^ their
souls that is belo^ of them.

Secondly, The Apo^ shows against whom G^ wrath comes.

Thirdly, The universal^ in these words All. G^ does not deal partially, (...)
all that misprison the tr^ in unrighteousness s^ have the wrath of God
de^ounced against them.

Fourthly, The place from whence it shall come, (from ^eaven.)

First, we are here to know what is meant by truth: For ^e better understanding
of ^e Text: Truth carries two ^ings with it.

First, The rule of righteousness, which is that ho^age and obedience we owe
unto God; and this rule of ^^ghteousnesse is the most ^xcellent rule that is.

Secondly, Truth carries (...) it self, the efficacy and ^ower of truth, and
therefore ^e Apostle Paul sharply ^proves Peter, Gal. 2.14. ^rse; that though
he ob^ved the Gospel in the maine, yet he did not walk with a straight foot.

Secondly, What is meant by holding the truth of God in unrighteousness.

To hold the truth of God in unrighteousness, is by a kind of violence, and
strong hand to hinder the operation and passage of it, that the Word cannot
perform that work which otherwise it would in the hearts of them to whom it
is sent.

Thirdly, What is mean^ by the word unrighteousness.

In some places it signifies^ sin that is committed against the second Table
only; but here in this place (...) implies all sinful distempers and
corruptions of heart, an^ this word (in) unrighteousness, It carries the cause
and authority, as when a man says, stop such a man in my name.

1 Doct. The truth of God is operative.

2 Doct. That wicked men are enemies to the Word of God.

3 Doct. That the corruptions of men's hearts, is the cause of the hinderance of
the word. But I will draw them all into one.

Doct. That carnal and corrupt hearts hinder the power of the truth from
working upon them, or prevailing with them, as much as in them lies.

It is true, that truth is powerful, and will prevail; (...) when he sends
his truth to work upon any corrupt^ heart, he does not stand to ask our wills,
whether we will receive or not, but he will make it effec^uall; he will shake
off all oppositions, and he will drive all before him; but let the Lord do what
he will, yet the carnal heart will resist and stand out, and as much as in him
lies, labor to keep out the Word; Romans 2.14, 15. Though Heathens be strangers
from the life of God, and from the Covenant of Grace; yet this little remainder
of the Law of God in their hearts, which remains will be a working in them; so
that murder and uncleanness, they will punish with death.

The truth is discovered ^ree ways.

First, when a man is about (...) commit any sin, as to ^eale, etc. his
conscience will ^mite him; and so in other ^innes.

Secondly, the power and efficacy of God may be observed in the Creation, yet
^he darkness of men's eyes, ^r the foggishnesse of their understandings, do
interpose themselves.

Thirdly, by truth, is meant the preaching of the Word, when the truth is never
so ^pparant, and prooffes never ^o pregnant, and arguments never so invincible,
yet their hearts will not yield, nor ^onsent, when the light of ^he Gospel is
plainly dispensed and promulgated, the^ must needs be a marveilo^ light, and
yet men will no^ yield to it, (as Paul and Barnabas) the word they taught, the
Jews put it away, when it gripes the heart, and begins to work effectually*
then they vomit it up againe^ Act. 7.57. Ye stiff-necked in heart, ye do
always resist the Holy Ghost, as your Fathers did, so do ye. Genesis 19.9. so
the Sodomites did to Lot* when the old and the young were gathered about the
house, and would have the^ out; and when Lot said, I pray you, my brethren, do
not so wickedly. Stand back, say they, we will do worse with the^ then with
them: As they did to Lot, so you do to Gods Ministers, when Gods Messengers
come and entreat you; O brethren, do not so wickedly profane the Sabbath, and
curse instead of praying; be not so malicious against the ways of God, take
heed of persecuting the servants of God, Stand back, say they, we will do
worse; and thus they take up arms against the blessed truth of God, when it
comes to pull them off from their cursed practices, etc.

For the discovery of the point, give me leave to express three particulars.

First, What is that work which the truth would discover.

Secondly, How wicked men hinder it.

Thirdly, The reason why they do so.

Quest. 1. What is the power of the truth, or what would it do that wicked men
oppose it.

Answ. It appears in four particulars; First, it is a word of Information:
that is the first work to discover all things to us in their proper colors,
Prove. 6.23. the Text tells us the Commandment is a Lam^^, and the Law is Light,
and the reproves of instruction are the way of life; as a Lamp in he night, so
the way may be discovered; so it is with the power of the Word of Truth, and he
that has a mind carefully to attend, may be able to judge, and see right from
wrong: a man cannot miscarry so long as he is directed by the light of truth:
as the Sun shows all the Moates in the house, and the blemishes, so this is
like the Sun to discover and show every moate and blemish, and to discover
every privy and corrupt corner, Ephesians. 5.14. All things that are reproved, are
made manifest by the light: for whatsoever does make manifest, is light: Thou
can not enquire to do any thing, but that will advise thee.

Secondly, As it is of Information, so it is of quick^ing, a word of power,
that not only tells the way, but enableth us to walk in it; it puts virtue
and ability to walk on chearefully.

It is not only as the Sun to show us the way, but as a stream to carry us in
that way God would have u^ walk, Luke 24.22. there is not a light in the
shining Sun (Christ) but is a warning to make nimble ou^ benumbed joints, 1 Timothy
6.3. He calls it the wholesom^ word of Truth, whereo^ Saint Paul speaks,
Tim^thy was nourished up with Psalm 119, I will nev^ forget thy Commandement^
because that thereby then h^ quickened me.

Thirdly, In the third pla^ it is a coard, though thou (...) dull, it will
pluck thee o^ So in the fourth place, it is a word of conviction, with power
to overthrow all the gaine-sayings of a man; it meets with every cavil, it
stoppes all the base tricks and devises of our sinful minds. Luke 21.10.
when the Disciples should be brought before Magistrates, says Christ, take no
care what you shall speak, in the 15 verse, For I will give you a mouth and
wisdom, which all your Adversaries shall not be able to gainesay, nor resist:
And in Acts 7. the Adversaries of Steven were not able to gainesay the wisdom
of Steven; the Word will convince thy mind, though a cavilling and distempered
mind, 1 Cor. 5.25. Better speak one word in a known language, then a thousand
in unknown. And therefore said Saint Paul, I was made manifest to your
consciences, Job 36.10. He opens their care to discipline, and commands that
they return from iniquity; though stubborn, he makes them give way to truth.

Fourthly, In the fourth work of truth there is a sovereign supreme
authority the word has, it bea^es down all, and carries all, and makes all to
yield obedience when the Lord pleases to accompany it; therefore there is such
a power that i^ is not carnal, but mighty through God to cast downe^ strong
holds, because he takes place only; so this is the fourth work, it carries
on a man, and commands the soul, 2 Cor. 10.4. The weapons of our warfare are
not carnal, feeble and weak, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of
strong holds. His Commandments are mighty, and what will ye do when you set
up strong mountains of pride, and bulwarks of resolutions: when ye are
resolved, ye will have your sins, as drunkenness, covetousness, etc.
though ye perish for it. So that the truth of God carries the heart and eye,
and foot. A mighty operation, The Apostle 2 Cor. 13.8. said, We can do
nothing against the truth: so that when God will make good his truth, we can
do nothing against Gods truth; Company comes, provocations comes, friends,
wife, though life comes, his resolution stands firm, he sides with the truth,
thus you see that truth will work.

Secondly, for the second particular.

And that is, how a carnal man does hinder this worke^ of the Word that it may
no^ prevail; the soul would have the sins, and the word would have the
soul, now a corrupt heart opposes the truth in four particulars.

First, A carnal heart is mavelous unwilling to listen to the truth of God;
so as to be informed and instructed in those things that would be too tedious:
first, it is not willing to know what it should do, lest it should do what it
would not; therefore it keeps a loofe off: he is a stranger to the truth of
God; nay, if it be brought home to their doors, and God set open his mercies,
the truth is, they will not so much as take notice of his mercies: To examine
every thing, what need a man thus tediously trouble himself? thus they hinder
the first work of the truth: it is a Schoolmaster, but they stop their ears;
Car^all hearts when they see it coming toward them, coming to tie them to
obedience, if he hears the Word coming, he slides away, he is loath to hear
the cause, and loath to be persuaded, he will not be at home on that day, Esaias
30.10. The people say to the Seers; see not, and to the Prophets, prophecy not
right things, speak to us smoothe things, prophecy deceits. Get ye out of
the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the holy One of Israel to cease
from before us. They say to the Seers, see not, and to the Prophets, prophesy
not right things: Do not speak that they cannot hear, but speak fair and
smooth things. Job 21.14. Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us, for we
desire not the knowledge of thy ways; The covetous oppressors cannot endure to
hear of the gringding of the faces of the poor. Acts 28.27. They stop their
ears, and wink with their eyes, least they should see with their eyes, and
hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be
converted, and I should heal them. I beseech you observe it as carnal men
that are loath to know the truth: but if they search, they seek after the Word
^s a Coward does after his enemy, with a hope he shall not find him, and a
fear lest he should find him; So a carnal man is loath to find, and fears
to know; and if ^e do know and search, he will search no more the^ shall
serve his turn: he will not suffer truth to have the whole sway: as a
prisoner in chains, so carnal hearts keep truth in Chains: and no more then
he does know he would know. Luke 4.42. And when it was day, he^ went into a
desert place, a^ the people sought him, an^ came unto him, and staye^ him, that
he should not depa^ from them. He made (...) though he would go further, but
they stayed him b^ a morrall kind of perswa^ on; so carnal men do the truth
of God, they stop a^ stay truth, Romans 12.1, 2 v^ ses, Fashion not your selv^
after the world; and in t^ Law, Ye shall not take t^ name of an idol in your
mouth: The meaning is, ye should not give honor to them; but truth goes
further; Shall I once name an Idol ^n my mouth, much less set up an Idol in
Gods service? Is not this much more? but stay you there, says the carnal
heart, as it is with an old man that lies upon his ^icke-bed, when his eyes
^re failing him, he cannot ^oke on the Sun, when it ^hines in his face; and
therefor he desires them to draw ^he curtain, for says he the ^unne shines
too full in my ^ace; give me a little light: ^old you there, a weak ^ght, and
a weak light: so when the Word comes to ^ne that would not part with sin, if
it come to shine fu^ in his face, and to pull dow^ his proud heart, and to
deprive him of liberty; O^ says he, Draw the Curtain for the Sun shines too
f^ in my face; but so much (...) serves the turn, Christ a^ liberty, Christ
and t^ world; oh hold you the^ says he. Deuteronomy. 12.31. Ye she not worship God as
H^ thens do, but as Christian Oh draw the Curtain, and^ and if thy neighbor
off thee more for a commode then it is worth, thou sho^ dest not take it; Oh d^
the Curtaine^, the Su^ shines too full in my fa^ says he; You must not (...)
off your Ware with ly^ Oh draw the Curtain, (...) and so of drunkenness, etc.
^riefely I conceive you do (...) some measure know how ^at they hinder the
work ^f the light of the truth; says ^remy, I hearkened and heard, (...) any
laid their hands on ^eir thigh, and said, What ^ve I done? Oh brethren, ^e
truth of God comes to ^ur doors, and hearkens ^hether any of you lay your and
on your thigh, and say, What have I done?

Secondly, whereby they under and hold down truth. (...) carnal heart labors
to ^pose this, and the powerful ^ication of this, and that it ^th thus: A
carnal heart ^ses up an evil report on ^e good truth of God, that ^night
appear ugly to them that should lay hold of i^ The Spies when they we^ into
Canaan, they did not f^ much consider the plenty (...) the land, to persuade
the people to come, but raise^ up lies, there is strong hold^ and Iron
Chariots, an^ mighty men, to dampe the^ hearts: so it is with a carn^ heart;
the Saints reprove, a^ Ministers preach, every o^ comes to reprove him, a^ yet
he is not persuaded, and^ John 6.6. There was man that followed Christ (...)
loaves, but when Chr^ pitched upon matter of (...) actnesse, say they, it is a
(...) saying. Carnal hearts w^ Christ is commended, (...) pleasantness,
nothing (...) beauty, full of comfort, (...) happy are they that can get him:
Grace here, and glory ^ereafter, Oh say they, it is a ^ard saying, they present
him only crucified, contemned, and mocked; thus they ^bour only to hinder it:
Take notice and see the grounds why they profit so little, it is because the
work of the Word is hindered by the business of our hearts; we deal ill with
the blessed truth of God: it is with the Truth, as with a Trade; some ^re borne
to great estates, and they are able to follow (...), yet their estate it may
be decays; what is the reason? they have been wonderfully hindered by many
oppressions, and cruel dealings at some Usurers hand; just so it is with the
truth of God you have had good meane^ Oh you have oppressed the Word of God,
and would not open; if any would open he would come in, but y^ have quenched
the motion of Gods Spirit.

Object. Is it in our power to make the Word effect^ all?

Answ. No, but it is (...) your power to do what y^ are able to do; your leg^
may as well carry you to t^ Word, as to an Alcho use your ears may hear t^
Word as well as songs; y^ may read good Books, (...) well as Play Books. D^
you what you are able to d^ and cry to God, and see wh^ he will do; though you
a^ not able to save your selves, yet your corruptions are able to hinder the
Word; and this is the reason why the Word prevails not with you, the Lord may
give what he will, and deny what he will, but destruction is from thy self,
thou have free will to sin: learn from hence to see the reason and cause
where the fault lies. Luke 7.29. The Publicanes justified God, being baptized
with the baptism of John: But the Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the Counsel
of God against themselves: the way of life was chalked out before them: but the
Scribes and Pharisees rejected the good counsel of God; thou see many are
called, Oh blame thy self. Where am I? all this while the Word would
enlighten, but I have contemned it; the Word would quicken, but I have
neglected it; I was almost converted, but o^ wretch that I was, company came,
and I choked it, and would not walk in the way of God: and the Lord has often
come to me, by the Spirit, and I have quenched the good motions of the same.
Brethren it is true; Oh blame your selves: go home, and say, why may not my
heart be made clean, the Lord wrought on such a one, and why not on me?

Thirdly, A carnal heart does oppose the good Word of God, by resisting the
work of conviction, if a man be so that he cannot but say, that he is in a good
way; he cannot gain say the power of the truth, if it be so with him, then he
labors with all carnal cavils, as much as in him lies to defeat the truth of
God; Oh that convicting! Oh that powerful Word, the Word of the Lord comes
like a sword, the Lord seems to aim at a sinner, that he says it is my sin
that is now discovered: Brethren, all the shift they ^ave is to put by the
power of the truth: As a man that is beset by an enemy, labors to keep off
the blow, lest he should be slain; so a carnal man labors to stop the
evidence of the Word, that it might not prevail against his soul, though it
sees the truth: it is not satisfied therewith, Numb. 22. As when Balack fent
to Baalam, to curse the people, thinking him to be a Witch: therefore whom he
blessed, was blessed, and whom he cursed was cursed; God says to Balaam, thou
shall not go with them; yet when they returned this answer to Balack, and that
Balack sent more honorable men the^ they, and tells him he wi^ promote him:
Mark the poor sinful covetous wretch, the sinful man says stay all night,
and I will se^ what the Lord will say, he^ would feign have the Lo^ change his
mind; Why d^ he bid him stay. The Lo^ says in the Text going before, Thou
shall not go with them: I but his affections were lingering after the housfull
of gold, therefore he would have God change his mind. So there is many a
carnal heart follows the wages of Baalam, as Saint Jude speaks, hearing
the Word; certainly, says he, this truth I will follow; but when riches and
honors come, then he will search the Word, to see for a Dispensation; this is
a carnal stopping of the truth of God, he will search all the ways, and try
all the conclusions he can, whereby he may cavil against the truth; this is
not the meaning of the Text, however a man may cause labor to a weak
Christian but mark thine own heart if it be so, I shall be vexe^ therewith:
therefore I will have some cavil; I will no^ embrace this course; therefore I
will invent a way the it may not be lawful to me^ When Saint Paul dispute^
with the Athenians, diverse o^ them encountered with Paul^ they had Argument for
Argument against him, that the Lord Jesus Christ was no^ the Savior of the
world* This is the general course (...) a carnal heart, if it may d^ vise a
course against it, h^ is contented; if so be the^ can be no prevailing again^
it, it sends far and nee^ and gathers Town a^ Country to seek it; as
(...) Usurer that is resolved to continue in it, he goes to forty Ministers
about it; and if he be told of the sin of it, he will say he will think
of it; he will search the devils Skull, but he will invent some carnal
Argument; he conferred with such a man, and he told him such reasons, but they
blew away as a blast of wind. Mark my Brethren, the Lord sent Moses to
convince Pharaoh, and when Pharaoh said, I will not let the people go, God
says, Lay down thy rod, and it shall be turned into a Serpent: what does
Pharaoh then? he does not sit down under the miracle, but sends for
Magicians, and they cast down rods, and they were turned into Serpents also:
but Moses his rod devoured theirs; yet Pharaoh hardened his heart. So when the
Word comes home, this Word I must yield to, this Truth I must entertain, and
when the Word comes by a mighty power, they send for Magicians, carnal
Arguments, though the Arguments out of the Word does eat up all, yet a carnal
heart does go away satisfied, and it shall be so.

Fourthly, and lastly, if by carnal reason they cannot defeat the truth, they
fall to flat resisting, they will have their way; and so Brethren, they lay
violent hands upon the truth, 1 Samuel 8.18. The people were set a madding upon a
King, they would have a King as all other Nations had; they thought that to be
a means of their prosperity, that would be a cause of their destruction.
Samuel makes a gracious Sermon to them, that they might be dissuaded: when he
had discovered all saving Arguments, they do not reply a word reasoning; nay
say they, but we will have a King, they are resolved of it, as a wretched man
said, (when one complained he could not do such a thing for his conscience) I
am master of my conscience, I can do what I will for all that. Numb. 24.1, 2.
When Balaam saw that the Lord did not give him leave, it did not please him, he
went not as at other times, but set his face toward the Wilderness, and the
Spirit of the Lord came upon him. It was his devise before he would curse the
Lords people, he made seven Altars, and seven Altars before to ask God, but
now he would put it to adventure, he would curse what ever came of it; and
thus it is with a carnal man, when he sees that all his carnal Arguments
fall, he says, I will not pray in my Family, etc. Know thou that castest away
the command of God here, hereafter the Lords command with a curse shall
prevail against thee; say hereafter I will not go to Hell, the Lord says,
Matthew. 25.46. These shall go into perdition, etc.

Reas. 1. The first ground of the point, why carnal men do so, is namely,
they cannot endure to have their sins removed, the refore of necessity, the
blessed Word must be resisted, every sinner loves his sin, therefore ye
shall observe when a man speaks against drunkenness and pride, etc. he says,
he met with me, he speaks against my sins, why he spoke against sin, against
drunkenness, Sabbath breaking, etc. Nay, he speaks against my person; sin
is as near as the soul, will not any man strive for his life? I beseech you
observe it; his sin is his life, therefore when the Word of the Lord would
plucke^ the cup from the drunkard, the Whore from the adulterer, he plucks his
life; every thing seeks to preserve his life, and will not sin do so too, to
contend for hi^ life, so sin seeks to preserve it is life; If that the
Ministers prevail, you and (...) must part, therefore do all you can to stop
it, the reason is, because a man's sin, is^ man's soul. Here is the very
ground, as it was in tha^ remarkable passage of H^rod, touching his brother
wife, he reformed many things, but when John said* It is not lawful for thee
(...) have her, when he must either kill or be killed; Heredias must down, or
John: he loses his Harlot, therefore he would part with all. If the Minister
meet with a man, though he never knew him, the Word meets with him, his heart
then rises, and either he must be gone, or the Minister gone. Why Brethren,
what do you do? it is your sin we oppose, a day will come, when ye shall
be content to part with them, oh the time will come when ye shall be content
to be rid of your money, the drunkard would feign be rid of his cups, and the
adulterer of his Harlot; No, then these will go down to hell with you, you
cannot abide them that would kill that which would kill you: the faithful
Ministers of God would kill your sins, that to a corrupt heart is his life.

Reas. 2. If they cannot have their sins, it is a vexation to them; it is a
plague and vexation to wicked men, that they cannot have their sins inquiet,
and so as they would not be moved, they would not have their conscience^
troubled; but if a man would have his sin and cursed practice, he shall have
the curse of the Lord to go with it. Revel. 11. verse. 10. When the two
witnesses were slain, they made merry in Town and Country. Why? because the
two witnesses that tormented men, were slain, the Word of God tormented men,
it is able to make them mad: why alas, you natural men damn your selves, we
do not damn you, but we tell you of your sins that will damn you one day.

Thirdly, Note Brethren, that for ever you cannot have these sins, but they
will cost you sore; for these men cannot endure to be crossed and
overthwarted, they would go on smoothly in their course. Acts 19.25. Paul had
there preached against Idolatry, etc. especially against Diana: Demetrius
beginning to see his commodity going down; mark what he says, You know that
by this we have our livings, therefore they came with a great outcry, Great is
Diana of, etc. There is some special corruption, that is a special hinderance
of the truth, a company of carnal men speak of the Word; at whose suite? it
is the suite of Drunkenness, and uncleanness, etc. So it carries a man against
the blessed truth of Christ, a corrupt heart cannot endure to be brought in.

Use 1. Is of examination, is it so that corrupt hearts do hinder the work of
the Word of the Lord? hecr^ the^ we have a ground of examination. It is an
undoubted evidence of a carnal and an unrighteous heart, and there is not a
better argument: art thou such a one that do oppose the truth of God,
according to the former ex^ession? Know thou have a false heart, a wretched
heart, (...) soul that cannot be saved while thou continuest so; I ^now in a
child of God there (...) sometimes a secret resisting, and when ever they
observe this base distemper, ^hey fall out with their hearts, they take up
arms against these base corruptions; it is one thing to have ^hese sins
remaining, and ^other to have the soul ^oysoned with them. When (...) wicked
man has poison, and lives on poison, carrying a secret opposition against the
word, it is an Argument, ^hee has a poisoned base heart.

The best of Gods servants may find these, the Devil, the flesh and the world
having about with them; in this case thou mai^ be carried whither tho^ would
not: Oh it is (...) heartbreaking to a godly man, he could almost pull o^ his
heart, saying, Oh what (...) wretched heart have I? The Minister this day met
with my soul, but what a hea^ have I? Here my Brethren let this enter into our
minde^ the case is true, take it home to every soul, go aside t^ your own
souls, commun^ with thy conscience in secret, say there is no body he^ betwixt
God and my self (...) deal truly, have thou opposed the good Word of the
Lord? Oh you rent in pieces the flesh of Christ, with the prophanations,
oaths, ^ursings; yea, the very walls of your houses cry shame on you for it,
and yet to this very day you will not be reformed. You see what it is. I
^eseech you, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, resolve against it.

The former truth it specially meets with three sorts of false hearts.

1 Discreet hypocrites. 2 Wrangling hypocrites. 3 Whyning hypocrites.
This discovers that all these do fight against God.

First, the discreet hypocrite, I know that discretion is a good and blessed
work of God, if it be used as i^ ought to be upon good ground in a good
manner, and to a good end: but the same Idol, Discretion the creeps in the
world, is the delusion of a man's conscience; therefore I call him^ discreet
hypocrite indee^ that makes truth his underling, that can hunt with the Hound,
and run with the Hare: by Discretion a m^ that will be sure to be on the safe
side, whether on the tr^side or not; he wonders (...) other men to see them
opposed, because they want (...) discretion. There are a company of wise
judicious professors that perish wisely, (...) Demas followed Paul; (...) when
he saw he might (...) better advantage, he forsook ^aul and followed the
present world. This discreet ^ypocrite lets profession ^e as the time
goes: they ^ill take occasion of whole^me communication, and ^ffer occasion; I
say he ^n conform himself to all ^nes: but then again if he ^e among
carnal profane ^en, this is a man safe that ^eth out Religion, and pul^th in
Religion, as the time (...) in a word you shall find (...) to admire at men's
per^ns, and yet keeps under (...) word. This I call a dis^et hypocrite that
goes to (...) wisely: these discreet ^pocrites have their religi^as in a screw,
at any side ^y will set Religion, and upon any terms, after any fashion: this
is the discre^ Professor.

Secondly, the wranglin^ hypocrite he pretends nothing but favourablenes^ all
love and liking; nay, h^ makes Religion his aym^ to scope the end of (...)
course, he does not say a^ thing against the truth: y^ he is a secret
underminer (...) Truth: to show you (...) plays: this same hypoc^ has one,
that we will man it appear he is a gross (...) pocrite.

He pleads especia^ against the common tru^ that he desires first, to k^ the
will of God, (...) how God may be glorif^ he seeks not ease or q^ nesse, but
he pretends he ^ekes the liberty of the Gospel, but he seeks his own
liberty, the liberty of his state: As Saul when God ^ave him a Commission to
^ill all the Amalekites; when ^muel comes, What says ^e? Blessed art thou of
the Lord; If a man take Saul's ^wne word, Saul is an honest ^an; I but says
Samuel; What ^anes then the bleating of ^ese sheep and oxen in mine ^es? he
says, the people ^d it; I but thou art the Go^mour.

They were good for sacrifice, ^th he. Alas, did he love ^rifice so well? no,
it was this own ends: so many (...) man pretends much ^ctification and
exactness of a Christian Course, Faith and new obedience, not b^ cause he
loves God, but (...) own end. But a man should be zealous in sanctification to
the utmost, even to^ hoof as Moses.

Again, you shall find hi^ to pretend mavelous humility. He is content to b^
subject to God in every ca^ but mark, he submits (...) these courses.

The last plea he ha^ Good men do as I do; a^ any reason, propound a
argument what mooves hi^ none at all, he brings (...) truth in subjection to
hi^ self and the falsenesse his heart, is mavelous p^ and is in the state of
unre^neracie

I reason thus: He that is not content to part with all for the Lord Jesus
Christ, is not worthy of Christ, He that loves father or mother more then me,
is not worthy of me, says Christ; to this very day, he never had the spirit of
grace prevail in him. Psalm. 119. David says, I shall never be ashamed nor
confounded, when I have respect to all thy Commandments. Now this wranging
hypocrite has not respect to all Gods Commandments, therefore shall he ^e
confounded.

Thirdly, He that under ^retence of whyning and ^rying for sin, loves ^nne:
this man oppresses himself; for under pretense of love, he opposet^ and
resists the truth.

2 Use. The last use is a ground of admirable comfort; it may relish in yo^
hearts and mouths; it is unspeakeable comfort to every soul, whose heart
lies level; do thou submit (...) the powerful Word of the Lord; to the
blessed truth art thou willing to have (...) to know it, to delight in it, and
submit unto it, to be a servant to the world? can^ home this blessed Word,
(...) there any soul that can te^fie it is so with him? If mistake not my
self, it (...) one of the soundest Arguments in all the Book (...) God; it
must be love that answerable to the truth when the soul is willing to hear,
to welcome and entertain every truth of God, can thou say in good earnest
and uprightness before the Lord, is there any more truths, and more good will
of thine, of thy worship? good Lord let me know it, that I may love it, and
practice it. Brethren is it so, take then this in you, and answer, it is (...)
Lord. Brethren, if there ^e a sight of God in heaven, and thou do truly
sub^it to the word, it is a true ^gne, that if any under heaven has the work
of grace ^ought in him, thou have it. ^hn 8. If any man love the ^th and obey
the Commande^ents, the truth will make him (...). Do thou then love and obey
the truth, it will make thee free, it will make thee a freeman of heaven; hold
this truth, Heaven and earth shall pass, but that work of grace cannot pass.
This was the joy of the Apostle: John 5.4. I have no greater joy in the world,
then that my children walk in the truth: in the light, comfort, and power of
it. If the Apostle John could have no greate^ truth, what great joy will it be
to thy self? no greate^ joy have I, says some man not that my son is ric^
but that he is upright. Ho^ may thou joy then, (...) ever thou see the face
(...) God with comfort, try (...) thou be upright, if the love the truth,
the Saint can see no greater joy then this: Oh go your ways you blessed
Saints, ye walk after the truth, you that have this, can have no more: God
himself loves truth in the inward parts; he is a spirit, and will be
worshipped in spirit and truth. Do thou love the truth of Christ? then it
will say as well of thee as of Demetrius, John ^.12. Demetrius has a good
report of the truth: So I say, does the truth report well of thee? Do not
fear what the world, thy friends, enemies or adversaries say of thee, that
will bring thee comfort, when all false witnesses shall lie aside: but all you
wicked of the world, you are they that bend your selves against the Saints of
God. It is true, the poor Saints of God, as poor as they be, they shall lift
up their heads, when you shall hang down and turn aside; because they have
the truth for them, when you shall see the poor despised Saints of God, poor
Goodman such a one, etc. You that have made no care of Gods Commandments, when
ye shall see them, ye shall wonder to see them lift up thither; when the
Devil shall say, Lord, how comes such a man to such a place? he was a finner;
I Lord (says the poor soul) I know I have many weaknesses: Lord thou know
that many a sad spirit I have carried about, yet never a truth was made known,
but I entertained it; never a sin was made known, but I entertained it;
never a sin was made known, but I loathed it; then comes the blessed Truth, I
bear witness Lord, he loved me, and entertained me, though with many
groans, and tears, and persecutions; he would have me, says the truth, he
is a blessed Saint of God. You that are willing to receive every truth, oh get
you to heaven, then you will be past the worst, the Devil himself confesses,
and the damned spirits: He is a holy and sincere hearted man; Why Brethren who
would not labor for the truth: I say God, and Christ, (...) good spirit shall
(...) such a soul; God (...) of truth, Jesus Ch^ (...) Word of truth, (...)
Ghost is a spirit of (...) they will embrace (...) God and Christ, (...) Spirit
all bids you (...) so you shall have (...) pinesse; the Lord (...) you to it,
and you (...) it hereafter.

A GODLY AND PROFITABLE SERMON: Of Gods Eternity and Man's Humanity. OR, The
striving of the Lord with Sinners.

Fleetstreet. 1639.

THE STRIVING of the LORD with SINNERS.
GENESIS 6.3. My Spirit shall not al^ayes strive with man for that (...) also is
flesh, yet his days ^all be an hundred and twenty years.


THe scope of this Chapter discovers it self in two parts; first the diverse
conditions of them before the Flood. Secondly, the carriage of God toward the
in the second part of (...) Chapter. First the carri^ of the people is double;
(...) their wicked and sinful li^ from the first verse to (...) end of the
seventh.

Secondly, the holy d^ meanor of Noah, in the 8, a^ 9 verses, But Noah fou^
grace in the eyes of the Lo^ Noah was a just man, and p^fect in his generation,
and w^ ked with God: Noah in the wicked time, in that wick^ place, and among
those wi^ ked people, was a holy man says the Text.

Secondly, we have the ^vers dealing of God wi^ them.

First, he threatens des^lation to the wicked; secondly, he promises to
preserve Noah; and for the ^guise of the wicked:

First, consider the hai^ousnesse of their sins, that they broke all the
Laws of God, and lust was their Law: in the first and second verses, the Text
says; When men began to multiply on the face of the ^rth, and daughters was
borne unto them, that the sons of God saw the danghters of men, that they
were fair and ^ookt for wives of all that they those.

The sons of God, the ^eaning of that is, they that professed the truth.
Second^y, they saw the daughters of men, they saw Caine, and they that were of
God did what they list, and chos^ cross way, and so ca^ strange generations,
as (...) ants, they were grown (...) the height of sin.

Secondly, in the 3, 6, a^ 7 verses, is the sentence (...) God against them;
he s^ they come to this, and the sets down a sentence (...) doombe (as it
were) he say^ My Spirit shall not alway^ strive with man, in that (...) is but
flesh; yet his days she be an hundred and twe^ years: The Lord w^ strive no
longer with the^ from whence by the w^ we may note.

Object. That when the^ is a mingling of diverse ma^riages, it makes way to
(...) struction, prooved in Sol^ mon, when he took him ^ange wives: then his
^owne was taken from (...); so this old World ^en they gave themselves ^strange
marriages.

First, In the sentence there (...) two things: first, the ^rds resolution:
second(...) the reason of Gods deter^nation.

First, the resolution, and ^t is first generally, he ^th strove, but will
strive no ^re.

Secondly, particularly he ^l not strive, and will strive (...) hundred and
twenty ^res; here is the resoluti^ of God, though he strive, (...) he will not
strive al^yes.

Secondly, the reason of Gods determination; he is also flesh.

In the Text two things are to be observed.

First, what is meant by spirit; secondly, what it is to strive: first Gods
Spirit we may understand to be the holy Ghost, the third person in. Trinity:
he is said to strive, not miraculously, but mediately by his means, the Word
of God, Ministers; he is said to strive with this generation by the Ministry
o^ the Word, and Noah and Enock in that Ministry* Gods Spirit strives with
wicked men, they spoke no^ in their own words, but i^ the 2 Pet. 2. holy men
spak^ Gods Word as they do; the Lord does put his hand to ^he work: the
meaning is, I ^ave sent Noah and Enock, ^hey spoke not their own ^ords only,
but ye have ^ven against my good spirit: what it is to strive: ^e Lord will
not strive al^ayes, the meaning is not, (...) judgment, Eccles. 6.10. ^he Lord
he deals with ^oore sinners after their na^re, as a reasonable crea^re, he
enters to reasons, and goes to Law, and makes ^ite to draw them home to ^im;
for this I take to be the ^eaning, his Ministers came ^metimes to exhort,
some^mes to comfort, and some^mes to reprove, and so we ^e to Law with God
a^aine.

From whence observe^ four points.

Doct. 1. The Spirit o^ God does ever accompany the Word, and the Ministe^
thereof. Here he ascrib^ it, My spirit shall not alway^ strive.

Doct. 2. That the Lo^ strives with rebellious sinners, for their good, who as
they strive against t^ power of the Spirit, a^ their own good. No^ strove to
draw them hom^ and they strove and wou^ not come.

Doct. 3. When men d^ abuse the Word long, G^ will cease to strive in the (...)
of the means; he will stri^ no more, as he said here, A^ (...) Lord said, I
will not al^ayes, etc.

Doct. 4. Though the lord will strive no more, ^t he strives long, he gives
^ng time of repentance, as (...) did to the old world an ^dred and twenty
years.

Doct. 5. That Gods Spi^ does ever accompany the lord, and the Ministry
^ereof: by the Spirit of ^od, I mean the eternal spirit, the Holy Ghost, does
^speciall manner accompa^ the Word; know that ^od is every where, and ^oweth
all things; but in a ^eciall manner he is with ^is; with the Word, Come,
^ecomes, and with the Word, ^rbid, he forbids; Romans 1. (...) Gospel is the
power of the Lord to the salvation^ man.

Quest. But how do^ this appear to be so?

Answ. I answer, it a^ peareth in two things, (...) God does please to set t^
work apart, to save and sa^ctifie our souls, which (...) the learning in the
wo^ cannot do.

Secondly, the Lord by (...) power of his Spirit, do^ constantly, and continua^
accompany this work, as^ thinks good, to be a con^ tation to the wicked, an^
consolation to the god^ 2 Cor. 2. the two last ver^to the one it is a favor
death, to the other it is a (...) vour of life; it either (...) the soul, or
saves the so^ though it ever accompanies ^e Word, yet this work (...) the
Spirit is a voluntary ^orke.

Thirdly, It does always company the Word, but ^oth not always work; ^or
some after twenty or ^irty years are converted; (...) that it does not always
^orke: Look as the brazen ^erpent was lift up in the Wilderness, that whoever
^oked on it, that was stung ^ith the fiery Serpents, ^ould be healed: there was
healing virtue in it, he set it part for that purpose, for ^at had no virtue of
it self, (...) because God would ^orke by it, so that whosoe^r looked on it
might be ^aled: so it is with the Word of God, for they a^ no more able to
conve^ then others, but because Go^ has promised to accompany them in
dispensation of i^

Reas. 1. First, taken from t^ fruit and effect of his Wo^ that it is able to
do (...) things; in the beginning (...) is able to do that whi^ Men and
Angels cannot do^ Hebr. 4.12. The Word (...) God is quick and powerf^ and
sharper then any two (...) god sword, piercing even to (...) dividing asunder
of the so^ and spirit, and a discovery (...) the thoughts of the he^ It is Gods
faithful work^ the reason why carnal (...) fall out with the Minister^ the
Word, and say you sp^ against men, I know y^ ^eane me. No, no, we ^now not
your hearts, but God does, and the Word of God knows them, John 5. The dead
shall hear the voice ^f the Son of God; the mea^ing is, they that are dead
(...) sins, for by nature every ^an is dead in sin. It must ^e more then
all men can do, (...) our Savior said to Lazaus, when men stood wee^ing by,
but Christ said, Lazarus come out. It must be Gods Word that must raise (...)
from the death of sin (...) the life of righteous^esse.

Use. First, of instruction (...) take heed of taking up of ^mes against the
Spirit of God, we see the heinous ^nne of them that despise the Ministry of
the Go^ pell, men may think it n^thing: but alas you kno^ not what it is, for
the Wo^ of God and the Spirit (...) God goes together; as (...) blessed Martyr
Steven sa^ in the 7 of the Acts, Y^ stiffenecked and uncircum^ sed in heart
and ears, y^ have ever resisted the g^ Spirit of God; as did your (...) there is,
so do you: therefore ta^ heed, You are near to (...) sin against the Holy Gho^
for it is not the Word (...) Man, but the Word of Go^ it is the Spirit that the
should be saved by, the thou have opposed; you g^ away with the contempt
(...) the Gospel, and make the nothing; thou have sinn^ against God, and his
Spirit ^at accompanies the Word; Counsel one another, say, do ^ou know what you
do? It (...) Gods Spirit, must not that ^mfort you, must not that ^ve you? It
is that that you ^ppose; take heed, for this (...) above Incestuous sins. ^ke
3.20.21. Herod was an ^cestuous sinner, but above ^his fins, he added this,
that ^put John in prison; he was a ^cestuous adulterer, yet put^g John in
prison, was love all. Matthew. 11. It shall (...) easier for Sodom and Go^rah in
the day of judge^ut, then for you that oppose (...) Word of the Lord. So ^ch
for the first point.

Doct. 2. The Lord strives ^ith poor sinners for their good; when as they
stri^ against the power of the S^ rit, and their own goo^ God enters into Law
with sinner; Sin and Satan sai^ the soul is theirs; God ent^ into Law, and
says it is h^ and he made it; every m^ by nature takes pain that (...) might
have no good fr^ God; he goes to Law, to g^ to hell, as it were. Matthew. 2^ 37.
Oh Jerusalem, thou t^ killest the Prophets, and sto^ them that were sent to the
There is the thing, mar^ How often would I have g^ thered thy children togeth^
as a Hen her Chickens, (...) ye would not? Here is a cu^ tention, the Lord
wou^ have revealed his wi^ and his Spirit, would have (...) ^ed you home, but
you would ^ot; ye resisted his good Spirit, ye take hold of wic^ednesse, as
the Prophet ^ere says; and John 5.4. You will not come to me, that (...) may
be saved, says our ^aviour to the Pharisees; ^any perish, and shall perish; ^e
reason is, ye will not ^ome to Christ for life. The ^icked say, Psalm. 2. Let
us ^eake their bonds asunder, ^d cast their cords from us. Gods commands are
cords and bonds to draw them, ^t you break over hedge ^d ditch, and will walk
(...) your own ways, ^cts 18. the 5, 6 verses Paul ^ccompanied Silas and
Ti^theus, disputed with the ^es, he professed Jesus was the very Christ; the
Text says, they oppos^ the words of Paul, though (...) was for their good;
this (...) the testimony of him, the whosoever will come (...) Christ, may
come: but the came in defiance and b^ta^ array against Christ, and t^ power of
the Gospel. The you see God strives wi^ poor sinners for their goo^ and they
strive against (...) power of the Spirit, a^ their own good. To op^ the point,

First, how God strives w^ poor sinners for their go^ and goes to Law, and
plea^ and bestows pains, that^ might do them good: (...) reason why he do^
so.

Quest. First, how does God ^rive with poor sinners, and pleads for their good?

Answ. This pleading of God discovers it self in two ^eads. First, by manner
^f persuasion: Secondly, (...) way of constraint.

First, by manner of per^asion, to persuade them ^om sin.

Secondly, by way of con^aint, to compel them to ^me in. And first he strives
(...) way of persuasion, where he discovers the matter, (...) then he brings an
exe^tion.

In this persuasion God ^th four things: namely,

First, He makes known (...) sin is, and that by summoning them to the
Court, as men that go^ Law, they summon one a^ other to be at such a Court so
God summons the^ when they are ignorant (...) that which should do the^ good,
and know not in wh^ an estate they are in, then (...) brings them to the Wor^
and discovers it, as in Es^ I was found of them, says (...) Lord, that sought
me not: b^ if a soul grow still carcle^ the Lord will not leave (...) sinner,
but makes him to c^sider what sin is, and kn^ it. Ezekiel. 16.2. verse. Son of
man, cause the children (...) Israel to know their abomi^tions: Go home to the
doors and tell them home, y^ know you should hear (...) Word constantly, and
pray constantly, and know what you should do, and this makes wicked covetous
men at their deaths, as it were, at their wits end. We know a man that goes to
Law, lays an Action against the other, and then serves a Subpaena on him; so
the Lord lays an Action against the sinner, and serves a Subpaena on him; thou
art the man, and thou shall perish, when he does this, then he pleades the
Cause, as a man that wrestles; he first catches ^hold, and then comes in to
him, that happily he might throw him: so God catches ^hold when he means to
wrestle with a sinner, that ^his eyes are ever on his sin and says, I am the
man.

Secondly, When a sinner is thus summoned, and sees the Cause goes against him,
then he labors and invents how to answer for himself; the sinner is grown to
a stand, as in the Court so^ brought, when he sees the case to go against
him, because he knows not what to do; he goes to the Lawyers, though his case
be not good, he will spend so much and so much; consider how it is when the
conscience is enlightened, and says, I am the man; then what course do they
take? they invent all carnal pleasures to pull back the Word; look what
Pharaoh did when God sent Moses to trouble him, he sent for the wise
Magicians' to know whether it were God or no; so he contem^ed Moses and the
miracle: so it is when God enlightens the mind; what do carnal men then? they
send for the Magicians, pleasures to beat the Word back.

Quest. I say they, I am a sinner, and every one is a sinner, and did not
Christ die to save sinners?

Answ. The truth is, Christ came to save sinners, and not to save them only,
but to sanctify them. True says the sinner, I will amend, I am not so precise
as others; these are the wranglings of carnal reasons; God comes nearer, he
says you must purify your selves as he is pure, John 1.3. It is not enough to
be a me^ro civi^ man, but ye most puris^ your selves, as he is pure. (...) you
will see God to you^ comfort, though Satan ta^ a Lawyers place, and carna^
reason an Atturnies, an^ what ever Satan and carna^ Reason can do, they wi^
do on every season: at la^ God sends the Comfort^ from heaven, to comfo^ them,
John 16.8. And when he is come, he will convin^ the world of righteousness of
judgment, and of sinne^ when Gods Spirit comes b^ the Word, it sets apart a^
carnal reason, that there (...) no more shifting: you think^ you may contend
again^ your Brethren, and go (...) heaven, but this cannot be, for the good
spirit sets all ^arnall reasons apart; it makes him to say, if I forsake not
every sin, I forsake ^one; for he that forsakes not every sin he forsake
none. Does any man think to be (...) Christian, and a swearer, a Christian
and a drunkard; why a heathen can do this: well, such will deceive themselves,
that can say, well I ^ope God is more merciful ^hen the Ministers and proud
Professors: No, no, know that if the Spirit come, it sets (...) part all
carnal reasons; God lays the Action be ^ore, the sinner is now cast, ^e sees
there is but one way, ^ive in sin, and go to hell: thus when a soul can
yield to Gods Word, that he m^ not be cast down. In t^ third place mark;

Thirdly, God tells hi^ that howsoever he (...) cast, yet he will be mercif^
abundantly to him; (...) shows him his estate; y^ says he, thou art in the
la^ of the living, thou art yet under the means, as a part^ cast in the Court
in a sum^ of all that he has; the ^ther gives him time to pay i^ there is
some comfort yet, (...) may be he may get something in that time by the help^ of
his friends. Romans 2.4. The Apostle says, Despisest the the goodness of God,
that should lead thee to repentance; as (...) he had said, Consider the
goodness of the Lord; an^ ^y, Lord, I am not yet in ^ll, and do I live to
an^her Sermon? thou were ^ercifull to Manasses, and ^others, thou may be
^ercifull to me (Lord:) why ^re is great comfort; but ^hen a soul sees Gods
^odnesse in health and ^ealth, and injoyes yet ^eanes, and helps, and now
^owes careless; as to mor^w I will repent, it is too ^one yet, I will take my
^leasure now, and repent ^hen I am old; now Gods ^oodnesse comes to be wea^ed,
that he says, I will strive (...) more.

Fourthly, When Gods ^oodnesse is wearied, then ^e patience of the Lord ^eppes
in, and pleades for a sinner, and holds the ha^ of Justice; Luke 9. As (...)
Fig Tree that bears (...) fruit, says Christ, I h^ come these three years,
(...) expected fruit, and have for none; cut it down. Stay Lo^ says the Keeper
of the Vi^ yard, another year, it (...) be it will bear then; (...) says
Patience, the sinner ha^ broken thy Comman^ments, and despised thy O^dinances,
abused thy Sa^ bathes; Oh forbear, sai^ Patience, one year longe^ one
opportunity more. No^ as Patience does plead f^ Gods continuance of mer^ to a
sinner, so it prevail^ now when Patience is tyre^ and wearied with wick^ men,
as I^rem. 5. How shall ^re, as if he would scarce ^rbeare; then when Pati^ce is
cired, comes Long^fering; says Patience, I ^bore this time and that ^e; says
Long suffering, ^ay Lord another year, another month: mark the ^ext, Forty
years long was (...) grieved with this people; Consider you old men, four^e
years the Lord has ^rove with you; and you ^oung men, God could have ^ken you
away in your sin; ^h I say, think upon Long^ffering, for else you had ^erished
before now, old ^ray-headed men; Oh for ^he Lords sake consider this ^ercy,
forty years a con^emner of Gods Word, four^y years a despiser of the means
of Grace; oh consider this mercy. Thus the Lord summons the sinner, then casts
him; the sinner i^ his natural estate, knows no^ what he is, and when he i^
cast down, God comfort^ him, and then, if the soul^ grow careless that God^
goodness is wearied, the^ steps in Patience, and when Patience is wearied,
the^ comes in Long-suffering; Now say, Lord thou came (...) home to me such a
day, such a atime, I promised t^ come in, but I have not; O^ Lord it is thy
mercy, I y^ continue, that I am not consumed.

Secondly, by constraint he constraines them by a^ execution, this is in a
sever^ ^er, as appears in three par^culars, when the Good^esse, Patience,
Long-su^^e^ing of God will not serve ^he turn.

First, he lets his heavy an^er fall on him, and take him ^y the throat and
says, you ^ill not come, but you shall ^eele my anger and heavy ^and for your
contempt; as (...) man in suite of Law, if he be cast, and the other deal
mercifully with him, gives ^im a day, and he despises it; ^hen he arrests him,
and casts ^im in prison; so God deals with a soul that dispises his mercy,
then he arrests him, and casts him in prison. Job ^5.24, 25. Trouble and
anguish shall make him afraid, they shall prevail against him, as a King
ready to the battle, for he stretches ou^ his hand against God, and
strengthens himself against the Almighty, as Pharaoh said, I Will not let the^
go, who is the Lord? So here he flies in his face, as in the 26, he runs
upon him, even upon his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: mark,
they that would kill one another, strike no^ where the other can defen^
themselves, but God ne^ not do so, he will run o^ the thick bosses of the
buck^ lers, and crush the vanity (...) his soul; this is the first^ thus you
see he is arrested.

Secondly, and cast in pr^ son, then the truth and Justi^ of God, when the
Sinner (...) ^rrested and cast into prison, ^yes an action against the ^oore
sinner, and shows ^m Gods former dealing; (...) a man cast in prison, first
(...) action comes of twenty ^ound, another of an hun^red, and so breaks him
for ^ver: so it is with a poor ^oule, when the truth of God and Justice of
God, lays Action upon Action, it ^reakes him for ever; in a lord, it shows
him Gods ^ormer dealing, his mercy, ^oodnesse, patience, and ^ong-suffering,
and every one ^f them he sees; you will ^ske, in whose suite? In Mer^ies suite,
and goodness, in Patience, and Long-suffe^ings suit; they will have their
Actions tried, because they have been abused, a^ the more mercy, the mo^
indignation to those the have abused Mercy and Patience.

Thirdly, After the wra^ of God has arrested hi^ and the Truth and Justi^ of
God laid Action up^ Action, so that everlasting ruin is ready to cease (...)
him, then at last comes M^cy and bailes him; here it that the Arms of God a^
open, for all his mercies (...) for a sinner at last to co^ in. Ezekiel 16.
Turn ye (...) the Lord, for why will ye d^ Oh house of Israel? Me^ says,
come to me, and I w^ pay all; though there (...) much guiltiness of cons^ence,
I will remove it. Ac^ ^o. As many as believed in (...) shall be freed from
that, that Moses could not free them; he does not say, all the ^vise only, but
all that will ^eleeve, whether Drun^ards, wicked, all that will ^eleeve, the
gate stands o^en to them.

Quest. True says the ^ule, they that God has re^rained before; but my sins
^e great, shall I have mer^e?

Answ. The Text says, ^hosoever that believes ^all befreed from all. Heb.
(...). If you sin willingly, ^en you have not had Ju^ice, Goodness,
Patience, ^ong-suffering; at last comes ^ercy which is the last, the which if
ye despise and refuse, ye can look for nothing but the heavy displeasure^ God;
Oh consider with t^ self, has the Lord spar^ me this time; many che^ of
conscience, a good fat^ and mother to instruct (...) and yet alive! Lord, wha^
mercy is this?

Reas. Why God striv^ thus with a sinner; first, t^ he might express his mer^
and that the world mi^ know he is merciful, and (...) joyce in it.

Secondly, that he mi^ leave the world without ^cuse, that if they go do^ to
the bottomless (...) thank themselves.

Use. 1. Of instruction. (...) seech you to admire (...) goodness of God to
sinn^ and withal our rebellions, when God strives so long ^or our good, and we
strive ^o long against it; is not he ^hen good? evil is the man that nothing
will do good ^f. Foul is the Leper that all the water in the Sea will not
wash; and great is ^he spot that no water will ^ring out. Labor to bring ^his
home to your selves, see ^our spots in this particular, that after you have had
so much goodness of the Lord, and so much Mercy, Patience, and Long-suffering,
to draw and prevail with your ^ebellious hearts, and all have ^eene abused,
neglected, and contemned by you; Oh let every one say it to their own ^hearts,
say thou, good Lord, they in Hell never had su^ means as I have, therefore the
shall fare better at the last d^ then I shall; are there su^ hearts as these in
Hell? co^ pare your selves, for know that the Word some times meets with thee:
sa^ Lord, it was against the Drunkard, he is come home and against that sinner,
an^ he is come, but if I stand o^ I am worst of all.

Use 2. If this be so the God strives with a poor sinner for his good, and the
sinner strives against the goodness and mercy (...) God; then mark what w^
gather; when they go t^ Hell, they have their desires they strive to go to
Hell; as if one would strive for wages; Know it is the de^ise of your minds,
and de^es of your hearts, ye ^rive who should swear the ^ost, if you go to
Hell, ^en thank your selves. Pro. ^.30, 31. They would have ^me of my
counsel, they despi^d all my reproof: there^e they shall eat of the fruit
(...) their own ways, and be fil^d with their own devises. When a soul is
resolved to ^e in his old course, as ^e covetousman, I will be ^vetous, the
contemner of ^e Word will live loosely, ^d will not be reproved by ^inisters;
these desire their ^wne destruction. Oh poor ^ule, when thou go to ^ell,
thou shall have thy de^re, and elbowe-roome enough there.

Use 3. Is of reproof. Do^ God strive with sinners, (...) their good? what
shall w^ think of them that stri^ with men for their hurt? (...) there God must
be blam^ for dealing so, or they condemned for being in opp^sition with God:
judge yo^ I will say nothing; the Lo^ strives; he uses Mercy, J^stice,
Goodness, to dra^ them to him and they use (...) means, threatenings, all
(...) withdraw them; either Go^ is to be blamed for deali^ so, or they to be
conde^ ned: they are the D^ vils Captains, and giv^ press money: as if a Wife
Child, or Servant begi^ to look to heaven, then the Husband frowns, the
Master chides; Oh lay your hands on your hearts, for the Devil can do no more;
Oh know not only thy sins shall condemn thee; but the blood of Wives.
Children and Servants; Oh brethren, I beseech you hear, fear, and tremble.
Acts 15.^8, 9. The Text says, that Paul came to the Island, and sound the
Deputy of the Island in the faith. Paul would have brought him to the faith, and
Elimas would have drawn him from the faith; mark what Paul said in the 10
verse, thou Child of the Devil, because Elimas would not go to Hell himself
alone, he draws others; and Paul comes with fire and thundering, as i^ were, Oh
child of the Devil, oh enemy of all righteousness; The Adulterer i^ an
enemy to Chastity, the Drunkard to soberness, the unjust man is an enemy t^
Justice, but they that striv^ to hinder any from God a^ enemies to all
righteousness.

To conclude: You say yo^ would have prayed, but my Husband would not let mee^
I would have gone (...) Church, but my Mast^ would not let me; this wi^
notserve the turn, it wi^ be no plea for you to say Masters hinder you. Matth^
23. Woe to you Scribes a^ Pharisees, Hypocrites, the compass Sea and Land
(...) make a Proselite, and when he is so made, you make him two fold more the
child of the Devil then your selves; they are the children of the Devil,
that is enough in conscience; but you are twice more the child of the Devil:
consider you sin, and hinder me from God, you shall go to Hell, but I shall
be twice more the child of Hell then you; oh then fear and labor every one to
mend one another.

Use 4. Is of exhortation. Does the Lord so strive and use all means to draw
us to him; does God do so? then do you so also, wheresoever thou go, do
thou strive to persuade men, and draw them from evil, Hebr. 3. The Lord
strives with poor sinner for his good^ now as God and Chri^ deals, so let
us; lay hold o^ a wicked Father, a profan^ mother, exhort them, pray for them,
Timoth. 2.2. Striv^ with them, though they strive against thee: tho^ prayest
once, pray again* it may be God will hear. When a man is laid in hi^ grave,
yet his stock remain^ and goes forward, and sha^ do till the day of Doom;
what a sweet comfort wi^ this be to them that do^ good to others; you tha^ go
in companies and assemblies with others, etc. strive to draw them on (...)
goodness, by exhortations* and sometimes by reproofes^ that if it be possible,
you may prevail with their hearts, to come in and take mercy.

Doctr. 3. That after the long abuse of means, the Lord ceases to strive with
men therein, and takes either the means from them, or them from the means, or
his blessing from them both; I will strive, says God, but not always; when
the time is expired, further is not to be expected. God has bounds of his
bounty, hitherto and no further, as it is with the Sun, it has it is times,
Spring, and Harvest, and there is a time to leave to Winter, and blastning:
there is a time of consuming, the store, as well as bringing of it in; so it is
with the Son of Righteousness; there is a time to quicken the Graces of his,
and to ripen them; and there is a time to leave men to hardness of heart, in
the darkness of Egypt, that they may be rid of the Word. There is a season of
grace, but that endures not always; God has his seasons to be merciful; some
the Sunshine of Gods goodness comforts, and makes grow, and some grows
away; the Gospel is going, when Ephraim was going to Idolatry, Hosea 4. Ephraim
is going away to Idolatry, let him alone, he has made a match with mischief,
let him have his belly full of it, now it is Tearme-time, but there is a
Vacation too.

A GODLY AND FRVITFVLL SERMON: THE PLANTATION of the RIGHTEOUS.

By T. H.

LONDON, Printed by M.P. for John Stafford, dwelling in Black-Horse-Alley near
Fle^tstreet. 1639.

THE PLANTATION of the RIGHTEOUS.
PSALM. 1.3. But he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
brings forth his fruit in due season, his leaf also shall not wither, and
whatsoever he does shall prosper.


THis third verse discovers a third branch of the difference of a godly, and
also a godless man; they are contrary in their practices, and in their ways
and doings, and so likewise shall they be contrary in their accounts at the
last day. Three particulars in the verse, do discover themselves unto us;
First, this righteous man, he brings forth fruit; secondly, it is his own
fruit, not another man's; thirdly, it is in his fittest time, and in the best
season, it is seasonable fruit; and this we are to scanne, and a little to
treat withal: and the Doctrine that does present it self to our
consideration, is this, namely,

Doct. 1. A good man does not only what he ought to do, he does not only
perform this duty, and what God requires of him, but he does it in the fittest
season and opportunity. In a word, the duties of Saints ought to be
seasonable: the point is somewhat strange to some, one that is little known,
and as little practiced among most; a mavelous skill is in it, and but little
skill men have to observe it; mavelous great good in it, and but little
laboring to attain that good; whereas it is a part of prudence to observe
times as the Text calls on us, to redeem the time: and therefore we will open
the point, and then treat with it; and first we will prove the same; secondly,
we will show the grounds and reasons; thirdly, apply the same; first, for the
proof of it, Eccles. 3.2. There is a time and a season for every thing; that
is Gods will and pleasure. Eccles. 10.6. It is there accounted one of the
greatest woes and curses, as it were, and evils that befall men. Woe to thee, O
Land, when thy King is a child, and thy Princes eat in the morning: But on
the contrary; Blessed art thou oh Land when thy King is the son of Nobles,
and thy Princes do eat for strength, and not for drunkenness. Thus we see
what a great curse it is to any Land to have Princes eat and drink not in
season, and in Prove. 25. the Text there says, That a word spoke in due season,
is like Apples of gold, with pictures of silver. So there is a season both for
words and speeches, as well as for actions and deeds, and words in their best
season, are worth Pearls and Rubies: So that the proof is plain, that the
Saints of God must have their opportunities for the performance of duties, and
a thing much to be oberved; Frost we know is seasonable in Winter. Harvest is
seasonable in Summer time, every thing is best in the season.

Quest. The difficulty that hence arises, is, how a man may discern the
season of a service and duty that is to be performed by us; for here is the
maine weight of the point.

Answ. First, in the general; secondly, in particular: First, when all the
circumstances and occasions do concur for a duty; that is, the season and
the time for the duty, as instance thus: it is the season for a man to walk
in the day time, in the light, and not in the the darkness. It is true, it is
time enough, in the night to walk in, but it is not the season; it does not
fit the season so well as in the day time; in the light, Wind and Tide for a
Seafaring man; warm weather is the season for sowing, and for casting the Seed
into the ground; so it is in this case, a Christian should observe the season,
and take the best time for duty in this case, when all occasions and
circumstances suite; and this is in the general.

Secondly, in particular, there is a season that a man must look at, both in
his particular, and in his general cal^ing, both in regard as he is a
Christian, and in respect of he place God has set a man (...); in the which we
ought ^or to make our season: for ^e doing of our duties and ^e rules for our
direction ^erein, are these, namely;

First, We must be sure to ^each and every time have ^e allowance, or the ^are,
as I may so say, ^at concern that day, and ^at time; as there are ^anges, for
to morrow ^ervices; for a first, and a second day, and third day, an^ that of
our Savior Chri^ is observable, Matthew. 6^ Take no thought for to mor^row, for
sufficient to the day^ the evil thereof: Every day^ brings evil enough with
i^ there are sins enough the day, and faylings, and impe^ fections enough
this day, a^ therefore no need there (...) to take care for a second a^ third
day; every day bri^ sins enough with it, (...) enough with it, and theref^ we
had not need to take (...) for another day, what she be to morrow, and not
(...) Monday to take care (...) Tuesday, not on Tuesday care for Wednesday,
(...) cause each day brings (...) nough care and trouble w^ it; for every
time has as it were, a challenge to it self, this day can say, this is mine;
another can say, this is mine; there is a time and a season for every service,
sufficient to the day is the evil thereof: So likewise sufficient to the day
is the duties thereof; there is prayer for this day, and prayer for that day,
not ^or another day, that is un^ertain whether it will come, but there is
service suited, and to be performed for the day present; God requires to ^eepe
the present day, and to ^doe duty that is for the present.

Secondly, Look when we find our bodies and natures best disposed for
services, then we ought to take them up, and then to besto^ our strength on the
best (...) our services; instance, for^ man to go to prayer, wh^ he is
fittest to sleep, (...) when sleep comes on hi^ or when he is in his bed, the
is not seasonable; It is the out of it is season and ti^ that instead of prayer,
a (...) goes to sleeping and wr^gling with the duty: a^ therefore we must
ta^ the advantage of our natu^ in this case, as men that use^ take advantage of
Wind a^ Tide, to sale forwards: (...) must a Christian take adv^tage of his
nature in this ca^ then when time is most s^sonable, they must perfo^ duties:
It is that God ca^ not away with, when w^ ^ill serve him only in a ^iny day,
when he can do nothing else; when every ^ing else is done, then God must be
served last; this is ^he next way to bring a curse (...) us, and our services
that ^ve do perform to him. (...) is the charge the Holy Ghost gives; Honor
the lord with the first-fruites of ^y increase, and to such he ^nexeth his
promise, so ^all thy barnes be filled with ^lenty, says the Text; and in ^e
Old Law God required ^he first that opened the ^ombe, and therefore a man ^ust
take the rise of a lazy nature, and to take heed of his sin, as that that
brings (...) great curse with it, as you ^ay see, Malac. 1. latter end, Cursed
be the deceiver, (...) who shouldsay, He is a d^ceiver indeed that offers^
female to God, when h^ has a male in his flock^ when a man has strong (...)
sires for himself, male s^ rows for his own ends, (...) female for God: this
is the second particular.

Thirdly, We should (...) take up duties, so order the^ that one should be
helpful to another, and not a hind^ rance; No man can look (...) many Irons in
the fire (...) once, but when the iron^ hot, then to strike; that (...) the
season for it to be^ wrought on; So a Christi^ an must take the season (...)
forecast duties, not to hind^ one with another, but every du^ie must be so
performed, that it may further and not hinder another: as it is with a Wagon,
the little Wheels go before to make way for the greater that come after them,
and the greater follow after, and serve to drive on the former. Thus one is
helpful to the other; so should we do with duties, so to forecast it, and so
to perform it, that one duty may further another, and not hinder; so that this
is the season when one duty makes way for another in the kind; and hence
follow several passages, as grounds of application. First, it is hence clear
that a man should so perform duty to God, that the one may put forwards
another to hel^ another on. The second ru^ hence is also clear, that (...) man
must so forecast duties that the particular may no^ cross the general, nor
the general the particular; a man must not spend himself, s^ in his calling
in particular, as to make him unfit for performance of duties, in his general
calling; he must not take up time in his own business, as thereby to deprive
himself of time and strength for duties of Gods worship.

Thirdly, a man may hence learn, that he ought not to spend his strength in
one duty, as to make him unfit for another, for that is not in season; then we
miss of the season; though he allow time for the duty, if yet he spend his
strength in one as to be unfit for another; this is unseasonable.

Now for duties occasionally: and we may observe two rules for the clearing of
the point.

First, if they be such occasions that may be omitted, as likewise they would
hinder another, a man may pass it by; but if a duty that comes in a man's way,
that requires present supply, and that the duty in a man's common course may be
gained again, and if the other be omitted, that can never be recalled again,
or recovered: Now this is a season for an occasionally duty, as thus; a man to
pray in his family: now if a necessary occasion come that cannot be done
afterward, a man must omit prayer for the while, for that may afterward be
gained, but the other it cannot be recovered again.

Secondly, if the case be so, that one duty must be lost, a man cannot regaine
both of them; what then must we do, both cannot be omitted, which then must
be taken up and performed? To this several rules might be added; but take
this, look what duty is the most excellent and necessary, take up that duty,
and let the other pass; if a duty that is more excellent then another, take up
that, and let the other give place to it: as for example, God will have mercy
and not sacrifice, and he delights in mercy more then sacrifice; if a man have
a house on fire, and another has his duty to perform before he can help the
other: why God requires mercy, he will have mercy rather then sacrifice, and
therefore I must leave the duty and help him, because God requires mercy as a
duty that is higher in place, and of more worth and excellency; other duties
must give place, and such duties must take the place, that is the season for
the inferior to give place to the greater.

Quest. How can a man know the pre-eminence of any duty? That which concerns
first Gods glory most, that service is to be performed, before the other that
concerns a man's self, the good of man gives place to Gods glory; sometimes
works of mercy are most to Gods glory, and all things are to be to Godsglory.

Secondly, in those duties that concern man, I must take notice of the things
themselves, and of my relation to them; as I must look to mine own occasions
before other men's, in the same rank, in things of equality; as my goods before
his, my body before his, but not my body before his soul; only I say
comparing equal things together concerning other men: if they be both equal
to me, let the chiefest things take place, as life before goods; Why a man
should be so careful for his season.

Reas. First, because this adds beauty to all occasions, and the works come
off with much content, seasonably, sweetly, with much succor; Oh how good is a
word spoken in due season! Prove. 25. and 11. when a man sails with the Tide,
and strikes while the iron is hot, and not to delay duties to a crowd, then is
the season: So in the work of grace, when men delay until the last hour, and
the dim eye, and death bed, when death and conscience, and all begin to crowd
on a man. Considering the opportunities God has bestowed, and he abused all,
and now is not like to have them again; these suit not with occasions, and fit
not the seasons, but will add more wounds and grief to the soul of man;
whereas if they were in their best season, they would come off with a great
deal more ease.

Secondly, because things find best success when they come in season: the
corn that is sown in season, is most like to grow and thrive, by reason of the
season that it was sown in, so that the season makes the work to go on the
better and the easier; and therefore the wise man calls on men, Eccles. 14. To
remember their Creator in the days of youth, before old and evil days come,
for old are but evil days; then is out of season, it is not the best season
then: for a thing out of season, is like Physic that is brought to a man when
he is dead, we say you should have come sooner, and then there might have been
some hope of life and recovery; when a man is in strength, then is the time of
praying, reading, and hearing the Word, etc. but God seldom gives the grace of
repentance in the dog-dayes of his years. Be wise now in the days of your
youth, or else you will repent with a sad heart at the last when have lost the
season of grace and mercy.

Use. Is it so that men do their duties in season, let this then be a word of
try all and examination in this case, to see how we have been faulty and have
failed in this kind, to see and be humbled for what has been amiss in us:
let each man lay his hand on his mouth, and bewail and look back, and view
our former course, to consider the opportunities and seasons we have had for
our good, or might have enjoyed at least for our good, and we have neglected
them; that God has set open his hand, and offered his grace and kindness, and
besought us to be reconciled to him, as it were, and has given us a market
day, a fair gaile, and yet have come empty from it; look back to the chamber
where sometimes a man has been, and some sweet motions, God has put into his
mind, oh pray now for your selves, and the Church, and yet has cast all these
motions behind his back, and slighted them as things of no moment or wight at
all; let us look to all these former neglects, and slightenings of grace and
mercy, offered to us; and as Pharaohs Butler said, so let us: I call to
remembrance my faults and sins this day; and thus much for the first: the
second follows, and that is this, namely, of Instruction;

Use. It teaches us thus much, that the life and conversation of a Christian
is a mavelous, tedious, and laborious life that will marveilously put a man to
it, if eve^ he come to be sincere, and to walk uprightly with the Lord in a
holy conversation of life.

Thirdly, a ground of encouragement; since then tha^ we know what we should, t^
labor to do what we know; since we know what God requires, and will pleas^
him, let us set about that h^ commands, and will be so acceptable in his sight;
seeing we know what God hat^ chalked out before us, and what will best delight
him, and also be exceeding comfortable to our selves, let us set about this;
let us pray in season, hear the Word in season, perform duties in season, let
our words and speeches be in due season spoken, because duties performed to God
in season, are very pleasing to him, and will bring great comfort to our own
souls and consciences; and any thing out of season, is displeasing unto God; a
thing out of season, a man cannot away with it; therefore how is it, to
meditate, pray, hear, read, confer, and do all holy duties in season; but
the question here grows, how shall we do this? for our rules of direction
herein are these, namely;

Answ. First, see and view the compass of all businesses, foreseeing all
occasions, and then allotting to every time, and to each occasion, range it all
proportionably to each occasion, a several time, as will suit it best,
observing the former rules that was mentioned: so in the next place, labor we
to prevent the time and the seasons, get beforehand, as it were, with time for
the duties of Gods worship and service, in this case, take time in the morning,
I will prevent the morning watch, says David; he got beforehand with his
Nobles, that when they were come, he might be fit to go and confer and
take their time together: when all was fast, then he got himself to his duty;
so we should prevent the time, and when we have so done, to improve it.

Fifthly, then cut off all unnecessary expense of time; Labor to be beforehand
in the world, get that wisdom, that courage, and that care that may shake off
all sleevelesse occasion that are not worth the while, both for your care and
consideration.

Psalm. 1. v. 3. His leaf also shall not wither.
