^He hye couragyous faytee / And valiant acts of noble Illustrous and
virtuous persons ben digne to be recounted / put in memory / and wreton. to
the end that there may be given to them name Inmortal by souerayn laud and
preysyng. And also for to moeue and tenflawme the hertes of the Redars and
hierers. for ^^^che we and flee works vycious dishonnest and vytuperable / And
for tempryse and accomplysshe enterpryses honnestes and works of glorious
merit to live in remembrance perpetuel / ffor as it is so that
thystoryagraphes have wreton many a noble hystorye as well in meter as in prose.
By which thactes and noble fayttes of thauncyent conquerours ben had in
remembraunce^ and remain in great. large / and aourned volumes / and so shall
abide in perpetuel memory to thentente that glorious Princes and hye men of
noble and virtuous courage should take ensample tempryse werkys leful and
honneste / First for gods quarrel / in mayntenyng our faith and the
libertees of holy chirche^ For the recuperacion of the holy land which our
blessed lord Ihesu Criste has hallowed by his blessed presence humayne / and by
shedyng therein for our redemption his precious blood. ffor the releef of such
christian men as there dwell in great myserye and thraldom^. And also for the
defense of their Royammes. Lands. Enherytages / and subg^^tes And for these
causes tendeuoyre them in their noble persons / with all their puyssau^ces
and power. tadresse and remyse them in their ancient Fraunchyses and lyberte
/ Acordyng to that we find wreton in holy scripture of many noble historyes^
which were here over long to reherce^ But in especial of three noble and most
worthy of all other. that is to wit first of duc Iosue that noble prince /
which ladde and conduyted the Childeren of Israhel the chosen people of God
out of deserte in to the land of promyssyon the Land flowynge Milk and
hony^ Socondly of Dauyd the King and holy Prophet / Whom God chaas after his
heart / And achyeuyd many great Bataylles gouernyng the said chosen people of
God by the space of forty yeris / And the third of the Noble Judas Machabeus^
how he deffended the said people in fyghtyng many and merueyllous bataylles^
for very zeele and love of his law and mayntenyng of the same^ unto the death.
ffor which causes a foresaid the names of thyes three abide perpetuel for three of
the most best and Nobleste of the Iewys / And in the nombre of the most
digne and most worthy /

aNd by cause valyaunce and prowess is remembryd among the gentyles and
paynmes^ as among the brewes I find wreton of the incredible. cheualrous.
prowess of the noble and valiant Hector of troy. whose excellent acts.
written / Ouyde / Homer Virgyle / Dares. Dyctes and other dyuerse^ and each
better than other reherchyng his noble virtues / strength and humanyte /
Secondly of Alysaundre the great king of Macedone^ which domyned and had to
him obeyssaunt the universal world And the third the noble Iulyus Cezar /
Emperor of Rome^ whose noble acts ben wreton by poets as lucan / stace and
other / And daily remembryd as new and ffresshe as he yet lyuyd / which three
ben set as for the most worthy among the gentyles and paynems

nOw let us then remembre^ what hystoryes ben wreton of Christian men of whom
there be many wreton^ But in especial as for the best and worthyest I find
first. the glorious / most excellent in his time / and first founder of the
round table / King Arthur king of the brytons that time regnyng in this Royamme
/ of whose retenue were many noble Kings. Princes / lords: and knyghtes^ of
which the noblest were knights of the round table^ of whose acts and historyes
there be large volumes and books great plente and many / O blessed lord when I
remember the great and many volumes of saint graal / ghalehot and lance lotte
de lake / Gawayn perceual / Lyonel / and tristram and many other^ of whom were
over long to reherce / and also to me unknown. But thystorye of the said
Arthur is so glorious and shynyng that he is stalled in the first place of the
most noble / best and worthyest of the christian men. Secondly of Charlemayn.
the great Epemrour of Allemayne and king of ffraunce / whose noble acts and
conquestes ben wreton in large volumes with the noble faytes and acts of his
douze pieres^ that is to say. Rowlond and olyuer / with the other / whose name
and renommee abides also perpetuel. and is stalled in the second place emonge
the most worthy of Christian men. Of all these historyes a for reherced the
books and volumes ben had in latin ffrenssh and English and other langage

Then as for the third of the Christian princes taken reputed and renommed for
to be egal among these worthy and best that ever were^ I mean the noble
Godefroy of Boloyne / which now but late not yet four C. year sith he flowred^
and was stalled in the third stalle of the most worthy of Christian men. whose
hystorye is made and wreton in Latin and ffrensshe in large and great volumes /
And as not known emonge us here / which ben adjacent and neighbors to the
place of his natyuyte / whose noble hystorye I late fond in a book of ffrenssh
al a long of his noble acts valyaunces prowesses / and accomplysshement of
his hye empryses / In which I find very causes as me seems much semblable
and lyke^ unto such as we have now daily to fore vs^ By the mescreauntes and
turks emprysed / against Cristendom. And yet much more now than were in his
days ffor in his days the turks had conquered upon Cristendom but unto the
braas of saint George by Constantynople^ And had no foot on this side the said
Braas^ But at this day it is so that they have comen over and gotten that
Imperial Cite Constantynople a foresaid / and many Royam^^ and country / to the
great dommage and hurt of all Cristendom / To the resistance of whom as yet
few Christian princes have put them in deuoyr^ Then I return again unto the
conqueste at such time as they were come to the said Braas. that by the
dylygent solicitude of a (...) heremyte / the said Godeffroy of Boloyne^ and
other diverse princes / lords and common people auowed the croysyng and empryse
to war again the mescreauntes. And to recouere the holy Cite of Iherusalem.
which afterward they achyeuyd. and conquered fro the said braas unto the holy
land and recouerd the holy cite of Iherusalem / as in this said boook al a
long and plainly shall appere^ In which cite the said Godeffroy was elect and
chosen for his virtue / prowess / and blessed di^posicion to be king of the
said Iherusalem^ and the land therabout

Then I thus vysytyng this noble hystorye / which is no fable ne feigned
thynge^ But all that is therein true / Considering also the great puyssaunce
of the Turk great enemy of our Christian faith destroyar of Christian blood and
vsurpar of certain Empyres and many Christian Royammes and countrees. And now
late this said year has assaylled the Cite and castle in the Isle of rhodes /
where valyantly he has be resisted. but yet not withstondyng he has approached
more n^r. and has taken the Cite of Ydronte in puylle^ By which he has gotten
an enter to enter in to the Royamme of Naples^ And fro thens without he be
resisted unto Rome and ytalye / to whose resistance. I beseech almighty God to
provide if it be his will. Then^e me seems it necessary and expedyent for
all christian princes to make peace / amyte and allyaunce each with other^ and
provide by their wysedo^mes^ the resistance again him for the defense of our
faith and mother / holy chirch / and also for the recuperacion of the holy land
and holy Cite of Iherusalem / In which our blessed savior Ihesu Crist redeemed
us with his precious blood. And to do as this noble prince Godeffroy of
boloyne did with other noble and hye princes in his companye^ Then for
thexhortacion of all Christian princes / Lords / Barons / Knights / Gentilmen
/ Marchanntes / and all the common people of this noble Royamme walys and yrlond
I have emprysed to translate this book of the conquest of Iherusalem out of
ffrenssh in to our maternal tongue / to then^en^e ^encourage them by the redyng
and heeryng of the merueyllous historyes herin comprysed and of the holy
miracles showed / that every man in his party endeuoyre them unto the
resistance a fore said / And recuperacion of the said holy land. and for as
much as I know no Christian king better prouyd in Arms: and for whom god has
showed more grace / And in all his empryses glorious vaynquysshour^ happy and
eurous / than is our naturel / lawful / and souerayn lord and most christian
king / Edward by the grace of god king of england and of ffraunce and lord of
Yrlond / under the shadow of whose noble protection / I have achyeued this
simple translacion / that he of his most noble grace would adresse styre. or
command sum noble Capytayn of his subgettes to empryse this war again the
said turk and hethen peple^ to which I can think that every man will put
hand to in their propre persons / and in their meuable goods / Then to him
my most drad naturel and souerayn lord I adresse this simple and rude book
besechyng his most bounteuous and haboundaunt grace to receive it of me his
indigne and humble subgette William Caxton^ And to pardonne me so presumynge^
besechyng almighty god that this said book may encourage / moeue. and enflamme
the hertes of sum noble men^ that by the same the mescreauntes may be
resisted and put to rebuke. Christian faith encreaced and enhaunced. and the
holy lande^ with the blessed cite of Iherusalem^ recouerd and may come again in
to christian men's hondes^ Then I exhort all noble riten of hye courage to see
this book and here it read. by which ye shall see what ways were taken: what
noble prowesses and valyaunces were achyeuyd by the noble companyes. and
especial by the said noble prince godeffroy of boloyne duc of Loreyne / by
which he deseruyd the name of one of the most worthy that ever were. and is
stalled in the third stalle of the Christian conquerours / And in the nynthe of
the most worthy / where his name and renomme shall remain and abide perpetuel
/ And for to deserve the tenthe place. I beseech almighty God to grant and
ottroye to our said souerayn lord or to one of his noble progenye / I mean my
lord Prince / and my lord Rychard duc of york and norfolk. to whom I humbly
beseech / at their leyzer and playsyr to see and here read this simple book*
by which they may be encoraged to deserve lawde and honour^ and that the^r name
and renomme may encreace and remain perpetuel ^ And after this life short and
transytorye / All we may atteyne to come to the everlasting life in heuen^ where
is joy and rest without^ end. Amen

Here ends the table of the content and chapytres nombred of this present
book entitled the siege and conqueste of Iherusalem by christian men
Here begins the book Entitled Eracles / and also of Godefrey of Boloyne /
the which speaks of the Conquest of the hol^ land of Iherusalem / conteynyng
diverse wars and nob^^ (...) of Arms made in the same Roya^me / and in the
contrees (...) And also many meruayllous works happed and fallen as we on this
side / as in tho parties this time during / And how he valyant duc Godefrey of
Boloyne conquered with the wer^^he said Royamme / And was king there /
The ffirst chapitre treats how Eracles conquered Per^ and slew Cosdroe / and
brought in to Iherusalem the very cr^se capitulo primo
tHe Ancient hystoryes say that Eracles was a good christian man and governor
of thempyre of Rome / But in his time M^chemet had been which was messager of
the devil And made the people to understand / that he was a prophet sent from
our lord / In the time of Eracles was the false law of ma^chomet sown and
sprad abroad in many parties of thoryent / and namely in Arabye / in so much
that the princes of the lands (...) would not give faith to his sect that he
prechid and taught which is cursed and evil / but he constrained them by force
and by sw^rd to and all their subgets to obey to his commandemens / and to
believe in his law / When Eracles had conquered Perse and slain ^^sdroe which
was a puissaunt king he brought again to Iherusalem the very Cross / which
they had ladde in to perse / And abode and dwelled in the land of Surrye / And
did do ordeyne and chose a patriarch a much wise man named Modes^e / By whose
counseil he did do make again the chirches / and habylled the holy places /
and cleansed them that the tyrant Cosdro^ of Perse had smeton down and
destroyed Eracles set great en^eu^e and made great (...) for to repair them
/ And whiles he intended there abou^e / homar the sone of captap which was a
prince of Arabe the third after machomet / came in to this contree named
pales^yne with so great nombre of people that all the land was couerd with
them / and had then taken by force a much strong Cite of that land named
Iadre / ffrom thens he drew him toward damask / and assieged the cite / and
by strength took hit / ffor he had sogrete a nombre of people that nothing
might resist him / the emperor heracles which yet dwelled in a part of this
land named Cylyce herd tidings ^f this people / And sent good espyes and
true in which he trusted (...) see and search their couine / ffor he desired
much to have a (...) with thise people on the field and fight and chase them
out of (...) lands and cytees which obeyed to Cristente and to thempyre of
(...) But when his messagers came he had by them knowleche cer^^ynly that he had
not people ynowhe to fyhte against them / ffor the^ were so fyers and so
orguyllous of the great nombre of people that theyhad / that they thought /
nothing might resist them / And there upon heracles had deliberacon^ and
counseilled with his people / that it ^^ld be lest dishonor to depart and
return in to his co^tre / than ^ffre his people to be destroyed and might not
amend it / Thus then he departed out of Surye by cause the king of Arabe
and his people were of so great power and so proud / as they yt fond all the
contre habandon^ned to them / ffor in a short time they had conquered all the
contre of Surye unto Egypt / One thing that was t^ fore happenned in this
contree which heelp much them of Ara^^ tena^ce their power ffor cosdroe the
puissan^t king of perse of whom I have spoken to fore / had been with great
puissaunce in Surye / and had destroyed the Cytees and castles / brent towns
and chirches and slain great party of the people / and the remeun^t had brought
in to Captyuyte / And took the cite of Iherusalem with force and slew within
the toun^ xxxvj. M. men / And bare away with him the ve^ay cross that our lord
Ihesu Christ suffered death on for us And ladde with him the patriarch of
Iherusalem named Acharye and brought him with him with the other Caytyfs /

Here recounteth thistorye how that the puissaunt king Cosdroe wastyd the
Empire of Rome for tauenge the death of the emperor Maurice / fader of his wife /
capitulo ijo.
nOw I shall tell you why he had so done / like as I said / he was a right
mighty king / now had there be an emperor at Rome named Mauryce which as we
find was much acqueynted with seint gregor^e And was his gossi^ ffor the said
saint Gregorye had cristenyd to him a daughter named Marie / This Maurice gaf
her in Marriage to this Cosdroe / And there by was a great frenship between them
/ and great alyau^ce between them of perse and the Romans as long as
the emperor lived / in such wise / that for the love of his wife / and the
Romans which were Christian / This Emperor made Cosdroe to be baptized But
after it befylle yt foca slew in treson this Emperor Maurice / And was
Emperor in his place / and was called ffo^^ cezar / when cosdroe herd hereof he
had merveyllous great sorrow gre^^ de^dayne / great orguyel and great hate
against the people of the Roma^ns by cause that he which had slain their lord
untruely / and was yet blody of the blood of the emperor they had chosen to ^e
their lord and had given to him thempire / ffor this cause ^e ente^^ded to his
power to hurt and destroy al thempire of Rom^ ^ And for this cause for
tauenge the death of the fader of his (...) which often enticed him thereto / he
entered in to the land of (...) which then was subget to thempyre of Rome
and (...) destroyed it / like as I have said to fore / and voyded almost (...)
the people that was therein / ffor which cause This king (...) aforsaid and his
people of Arabe that fond this land so void (...) the better do their wylles
with all /

How this puissaunt king entered in to Iherusalem and demau^^ded dylygently of
the Temple and reedyfied it and assigned gr^^e revenues thereto for tentretene
it capitulo iiio.
When they came in the holy cite of Iherusalem. they fond it destroyed and
deserte / sauf a few christian men which dwelled there and were suffered that
they should live as Christian men and make again their chirches and that they
should have a patriarch In the while that this mighty prince duellid in
Iherusalem he began tenquyre much eu^entifly of the people of the toun^ and
pryncipally of the patriarch which was named Sophonye / and had been chosen
after modeste which was deed of whom I have spoken to fore In what place the
temple of our lord had be when Titus the prince deffeted and destroyed all the
cite / he shewid to him the very certain place and the fondamentes and a part
of the muraylles which were then^e yet apperyng / he made anon to be sought
and to be brouht to him without long taryeng great nombre of masons and of
carpenters / and did do be fette stones of marble and of other manner and all
things necessary thereto he did do assemble as much as should need / And
devised the manner and ordynance of the mesure / and of the dyspences for to
make the temple / And as he was a noble prince of hy^ affair and noble / he
brought anon to end this that he had emprised in such wise that the temple
was reedefyed in such form and estate as it yet apeereth / this said prince
him self assygned great rentes and revenues ffor ever more for to sustene and
repair all that should be nedeful to thedyfi^es and other necessites of the
temple / and for the seruyng of the light day and night by the hands of them
that he commysed to keep the temple / There is in the same temple within and
without letters of gold in the langage of Arabe which deuyse as we suppose /
who was he that reedefyed the temple / and what time / And how much it costeto
rebylde it /

How Charlemayne by his lyberalite gate for the prouffyt of christian people in
hethenes / thamytye of hethen princes / capitulo iiij
tHus it happed that this holy cite of Iherusalem for the sins of the people
was in seruage and in danger of hethen people long time / That is to wete cccc
xxx iiij / year contynuelly / but not all way in one manner / They were one
time better and another time werse / like as the lords changed which were of
diverse manners and conditions / but nevertheless thise people were always in
subjection / It happed that one great lord of this said law had nyghe in his
seignorye all the land of thoryent sauf only ynde / This prince was named /
Aaron and his surname ressit / This man was of so great cortosye / of so great
largess / of so hye vygour / and of so great affairs in all good manners that
yet the paynems speak of him / like as they do in ffrau^ce of Charlemayn /
they were both in one time this aaron and this charlemain And therefore in
their time the christian people in Iherusalem were in better point / than they had
ever be to fore under any of the hethen people / ffor Charlemayn the good
Emperor which so much trauailled and suffryd for our lord / and so much
enhaunced the faith of Ihesu Criste to the end that the Cristiente in Surye
might be the better and more debonairly cherysshed and entreated / Pourchassed
so long that he had the love and acqueyntau^ce of the said Aaron by messages
that went and came / Whereof this Aaron had much great Joy / And above all
the princes of the world he louid and honored the emperor Charlemayn^ and the
Christian people that were under him / And all the holy places that were under
his power / he would that they should be entretiened mayntened and well aourned
like as Charlemayne had desired and sent to him word / Whereof it seemed that
our people being there / Were more under the power of Charlemayne than under
the power of the hethen men / When he might find the messagers of Charlemayn /
he charged and laded them all with richesses of thoryent / with clothes of
sylke with spyces / Ieweles of gold of diverse facions / And with rich
precious stones which he sent to his friend Charlemayn / And largely he gaf
and rewarded the messagers / And emonge al other things / He sent into
ffraunce an Olyphant / This debonayrte pourchased the good Charlemayn for the
Christian men that were in captiuyte under the said Aaron / And in like wise the
said Aaron for the love that he bare to Carlemayn pourchassed for other Christian
men that were in all hethenes under diverse lords as in egypt And in Aufrigue
/ That is to seye in Allexandrye / And in Cartage / ffor ^e sent great yeftes
and much good to sustene the power of Christian men and sent great presents
unto their lords and maistres myscreauntes and amyable letters / In such wise
that he pourchassed their love and acquaintance / by which they contained
them more debonairly un to cristiens yt were in their subjection thus did the
hye prince charlemayn unto the hethen lords that were fer fro him / ffor it is
to be bileuid / that if he had been nyghe to them that he would have essayed for
to have delyuerd in another manner the people of our lord like as he did right
gloriously in many places /

Of the noise that sourded emonge the hethen men discordyng in their law / and
how they of egypt issued out of their land and of the euyllis that they did
capitulo vo.
iN this season it happed that a great debate sourded between the mescreaunts
of Egypt / and the mescreaunts of Perse / ffor eueryche party of this people
would have the seignourye upon the other / The Rote of this great hate and envy
sourded ande aroos of that which discorded / and yet dyscorde of certain
points of their law / in such wise that they have diverse names / ffor they
that hold the law of perse have the name in their langage. soun / And they of
the law of Egypt be named siha. And they be not so far fro the very christian
law / as ben the other / It happed that they of Egypt issued out of their
land / and conquered all the lands unto Antyoche / And emonge the other
cytees that were taken / The holy cite of Iherusalem came under their power and
seignourye / The people that were there in captinyte were resonably well
entreated / till it happed by the suffrau^ce of god that his people should be
chastised / and that was by a desloyal and cruel lord and calyphe of Egypt
which was named hecam / he passed in malice and cruelte all his predecessors
in such wise that the people of his law held them as wode men of pride / of
rage / and of falsched / Emonge the other tyrannyes he commanded to cast down
to the ground the church of the sepulcre of our lord Ihesu Christ / which
had been made first of Constantyne the emperor / by a noble Patryarke of
Iherusalem named Maxyme / and after r^edefyed by modest that other patriarch /
In the time of heracles of whom we have spoken to fore / he sent to them a
falls caliphe one his bailey which was lord of Rames and named hyart This did
the commandment of his lord and cast it down to ground / In this time was
patriarch of this church a right valiant man named Oreste / and was uncle
unto this untrue king of Egypt brother of his mother / And this was the reason
why he was so cruel ayenste Crystiente / ffor the heethen men said that he
should never be ferme in their law / by cause he had a christian mother / And for
to take away this suspecion he destroyed this holy church of the holy sepulcre
/ which was the fontayne and beginning of our very creaunce /

How thaffliccyon. injuries and torments of christian men grew in the time of
Calyphe hetam capitulo vjo.
fRo then forthon began thestate of our people at Iherusalem to be more
grievous and more sorrowful than it was wont to be / ffor they took great
displaysir at their ber^e for the church of the resurrexion of our lord
which they saw so destroyed emonge them / And on that other side they were
charged over sorowfully with tributes. taskes and tayllages a^en^t the custom
and preuyleges granted to them of hethen princes* And also they were deffended
to make any festes on the da^es of their hye festes / but then they were
compellyd to traua^lle by force and anger / or they were commanded not to issue
out of (...) howses ne doors / but hold them cloos within / to the end that
they should make no semblaunce of feste within them / And ^et al^o they might
not be therein in pees ne assured / but they cast at (...) by the wyndows great
stones. donge. dyr^e. and foul or^^re^ And if it happed sometime a Christian man
to say a light wor^e that dyspleased any of the hethen men / Anon he should be
taken like a murderer and brought to prison / and should lose therefore his fyste
or foot / or he was brought to the gybet / And all the good that he had / was
brought in to the hands of the Caly^^e ^ Sometime they would take the children
of the christian people / bo^^e so^es and doughtres in to their own howses / and
made them mescreaunts against their will / And sometime by betynge / and another
with lies and flaterye made many young folk to renye our faith / And thus they
did to our people much (...) and grief / But notwythstondyng / good christian
men le^te not / but admonested and conforted the people to suffer all this with a
good heart and very penitence for the faith of Ihesu Criste and promised them
for thise shames / the Joy / thonour and the glory of heaven which ever shall
endure / The good Christian people spack so to gydre / that they enforced them to
hold And keep their christian faith the more surely / By cause they did them so
much harm And repreef It should be over long a thing to rec^unte to you /
All the meseases and the myschiefs that the people of our lord endured that
time. But I shall show you one exampel / to the end that by the same ye
understand the more of other / One of the hethen men ouermoche malicious and
untrue which hated of ouermoche cruel hate the christian men / he advised and
thought an a day how he might bring them to death He saw well that all the
cite held the temple in much great honor and reverence which was reedefyed
and the lay people named it / the temple dominus / and that they which had the
charge to keep it did al their pain to keep it cleen and net / now there was
a place to fore the temple which was named thaitre of the temple / Which they
would keep as clean / as christian men keep their chirches and aultres / And this
vntreu man that I have said you of to fore. Took by night in such wise that no
man saw it / a deed hounde al roten and stynkyng and brought it in to the same
aitre to fore the temple / On the morn when they of the town came to the temple
they fond this dog / Then sourded and aroos / a cry / a noise and a
clamor so great through all the town / That there was nothing spoken of but of
this hounde^ They assembled / and put out of doubt / that this was not done ne
cast there but by the Cristyens / All the hethen men Accorded to this point
that all the christian people should be put to death with the swerd / And there
were their swerdes drawn ready out / And they also that should smite of their
heedes^ Emonge the christian men was a young man of a much great heart and of
great pity / And spak to the people and said to them / ffair lords truth it
is / That I am not culpable in this thing. ne none of you as I believe
certainly / But it should be ouermoche great do^mage if we all should deye thus
ffor by this should all the Cristendo^me be quenchid in this land / Wherefore I
have thought in my self / How I shall deliver you all by thayde of our lord /
Two things I desire of you for the love of god / That one is that ye pray for
my soul in your orisons / That other is that ye deporte and honor my pour
lygnage / ffor I will take this thing on me / and say that I all one have
done this fayt which they put on us all / they that doubted the death had
great Joy when they herd this / and promised to him their orisons and thonoure
of his lygnage / In this manner that they of his lygnage eue^more on palmsonday
shall bear tholyue which signyfyeth Ihu Criste when he came in to Iherusalem /
Thus this man came to fore the Justice / And said to them that the other Christian
men were nothing culpable in this fayt / and said that he him self had done
the deed / when they h^rde this / they delyuerd all the other / And he only
had his heed smeten of /

How at the request of The Emperor of Constantynoble the crist^n men obtained
license to bylde again the church of the holy se^ulcre capitulo.vijo.
sVche diseases suffered the people of our lord in this time but Ihu christ that
well can set remedies in things m^ru^illous and out of order / and recomforte
them after ffor t^is vntr^we prince of egipte hetam deyde / and his sone named
d^^^r reigned after him / This daher renewed the alyau^ces with the emperor of
constantynoble which / was a Romayn and named Elio^^litans / he prayde the
said daher whom he much lou^d that he would suffer that the Christian men might
reedefye the church of the holy (...) which his fader had do beten doun^ / he
granted it for the love of the emperor / It was not long after that this
emperor deyde and after him reigned Constantyn which had to surname
Monoma^ques / which is to say in greece as a man fyghtyng allone The pour
christian that were in Iherusalem had license for to make again their chirches /
but they had not the power for their pouer^^. And herupon they had a counseyl
that they would send to the emperor / and require him for gods sake that he
would help and socour of his Alms for the reedefyeng of this holy work /
There was in the toun^ of Iherusalem a good man named Johan Cariaintes born in
Constantynople and had been a great gentilman of the contre as of his lignage /
But yet was he more gentil of heart and good manner / This man was comen on
pylgremage to the holy sepulcre and had left all the bobau^ce and thonour of
the world / and had taken thabyte of relygion / ffor to follow our lord Ihesu
Criste in ponerte in the place / where he suffered pouerte and messease for us
This said John was prayed of all the christian people there that he would
entrepryse this message for to go to the emperor for the love of god and of them
/ he did it with a good will and departed and came in to Constantynoble and
spak to the emperor / and did all that he was required / ffor the emperor
granted that he would make all the dispences that should be nedeful to the
byldyng of this holy church / and would reedefye it at hi^ owen cost / This
John was much Joyous when he had so well accomplissyd his message / and took
leave of the emperor and came again in to Iherusalem / when he had said to the
people. the good tydinges that he brought / they made great Joy And many went
great terees for pity / by cause they thought that our lord would not always
forgete them / when he had do to them such c^mforte / In this time was
patriarch in Iherusalem an holy man named nycesores / The Emperor held right well
his promise ffor he sent without taryeng great partyr of his tresour / and
did do make the church of the holy sepulcre much hye in thestate and manner
that it is yet / And was full made the year of thincarnacion of our lord a M
xlviij And had been xxxvij year destroyed This was right the year to fore that
our people recouerd the cite / When the Christian men there had made again the
church / they were much Joyous and were also therein well comforted of all
their mescases and repreues that they suffered whereof they had great plente /
not only in Iherusalem / But also in all the cyt^es about / as in bethleem /
And in the cite where Amos the prophet was born named Tecua / As often as the
Caliphe sent in to the land a new bailey / so often were set on them new
tributes and taillages which they might not well pay / and if they paid not
anon they menaced them for to cast down their chirches to the ground / and
said they had of their lord commandment so to do thus in this sorrow were the
christian people / one while under them of egipte / another time under them of
Perse / but this was not but yet a beginning to them as when they came under the
power of the turques / ffor the turques conquered the Royame of perse / and also
of Egypt Thus the holy cite fylle in to their demayne / which demened it so
cruelly and tormented it so cruely / that it seemed to the people of our lord
that they had be in fraunchise and in great rest under them of Egypt and of
perse Thus held the turks them there viij year /

Of the turks fro wens they came / and how they grew in to great puisaunce and
did chese them a king for to mayntene their wars capitulo / vijjo.
for as much as we have spoken of the turks / and shall ofer speak of them in
this book / me seems good that I say to you fro whens this people came first /
and whereby they had so great power / The turk and turkemans came out of a
lynage Roce of a contre toward the Eest which is in surye And were a people
much rude and without ordinance / ne had no contreye ne no certain dwelling
place / But went all about fro land to land / and sought pastures for their
beestis / ne never duellid in castle ne toun^ And when they would meue from one
place to another / t^enne went every lynage by him self / And they made in
every kynred or lygnage a prince which was their Iusticer by thise p^ynces all
their mesfeates and trespeaces were redressyd and amendid / And they obeyed and
did that he or they commanded / They carried with them all their things
servants / menages / household / their Oxen kyen sheep / and other beestis In
this thing was all their richesse / They labored no land by eeryng ne
sowyng ne they could neither bye ne selle / ffor they had no money / but their
beestis their chese and Milk changed they for to have other things that they
neded When they had been in one place and had need to goo in to another / they
sent the wisest of their people unto the princes of the co^tre / And they made
couenauntes for them for to dwell in their wodes and pastures for the /
tribute that they should pay like as they should accord / Now it happed that a
great party of this people departed fro the other / and entered in to the land
of perse / and fond this land much plentyvous of pastures / and right good
of such as they neded / And gaf to the king the trybute that they were
accorded fore / And dwelled there I can not tell how long / This people began
to grow and multeplye in such wise that there were of them a meruayllous
great nombre / in so much that the king and they of the contre self began to
have great doubt of them and fere / lest they might do harm by the power
that ouermoche grew and encreced / here upon they had a counseyl emonge them /
that they would drive and chasse them by force out of their land / But after
they changed their counseyl / and seemed better / that they should charge them
with such tributes that they might not suffer / And then they should depart
by their own agreement like as they were come / Thus they did / But they
suffered long thise greues / til at last when they might no more suffer /
they cou^seylled among them self that they would no more pay to the king when
the king herd this / he did do cry through all his Royamme / that they
should issue out of it by a certain day that was named to them / And that they
should pass the flood named cobar which is vtterist part of the Roya^me of
perse on that other side / And when they were departed and on the plain they
saw them self over and apperceyued that they were so great plente of people
that no land might suffyse them / ne withstonde them if they held hem to
gydre ffor to fore when they dwellid in perse / they dwellid fer a sondre in
such wise that they knew not their power / But now when they saw that they
were so many / they had meruaillous great desdayne of that they had suffered /
and the pride and grieuousnes of one prince They take counseyl emonge them and
saw that no people might resist them / but might conquer all lands there
about / But one thing destrobled them / and that was / they had no king on
them / And then they did in this manner / They fond emonge them an hundred
lignages / of which euerich had his meyne / And every lignage brought forth an
Arowe marked in such wise that the Arowe of each lignage might be known / and
when all thise Arowes were brought to gydre / They called a lytil child / and
commanded him to take up such one as he would / ffor they had acorded emonge
them / that of the lignage that the Arowe should be taken up by the child /
they should chese them a king / The child took up one of a lignage that after
was called Selduces / Now they knew that of this lignage they must chese a
king / And they took an hundred of the most prudent and wise men that they
could find in all the lignage / And commanded that each of them should bring an
arowe / whereon his name should be wreton / And after they called the child /
and bad him take up one of the Arowes / And concluded emonge them / that he
should be king / of whom he took up the arowe / he took up one / on which was
wreton Selduc / This Selduc was a much goodly man / and gretely honored / in
his lignage / he was great and strong a good knight and well proved / and seemed
well to be a good man and of hye works / They chees all this man for to be
their king as they had promised / And did to him homage and feaulte by oath
and obeyed him and honored him like as is don to a new king / This king for
the first of his commandementis commanded and made do cry ouerall on pain of
lesyng of their lives they should repasse and goo over again the flood of Cobar
/ and return again in to perse / ffor they would no lengre be in danger for to
seche place and stead where they might dwell / but would that they should
conquer this l^nde and other / and reteyne them in their seignourye / like as
he said and commanded it was don / ffor the people conquered in a short space by
force of arms not only the Royame of Perse / but all Arabe and other contrees
of thoryent / and took them by strength and retained them under their power /
And thus it happed that this people that tofore had be so rude / and lived so
out of rule as beestis after gate in less than forty year so great
seignouryes as ye now (...) / And mounted in so great pride / that they would
no more have the name like as the other had / wherefore they were called turks
^ The other that would not leave their manner of living were alle^way named and
yet ben Turquemans / Thise people when they ^ad conquered this contre of thoryent
/ they would enter in to the Royam^me of Egypt / ffor they were of much great
puissaunce / And descended in to Surrye / and conquered the contre / And emonge
the other cytees they took the holy cite of Iherusalem / And such people as
they fond there they demened right evil and torment^d and grieved them more
than they had been to fore / like as I have said to you to fore /

Of thorryble sins regnyng then in crystiante as well in these parties / as
in tho parties capitulo ixo.
yE have herd how this people that were crys^en were deme^ned in this contre of
thoryent / Now ye may bear how the crystiente is contened and ruled in other
parties of the world / know ye for certain that this time were fou^den but
few* that had the dread of our lord in their heart / All right wysnesse /
all truth / all pity were faylled / The faith of Ihesu christ was as it had
be quenchid / and of charity men spack not / debates / discordes / and wars
were nyhe oueral / in such wise that it seemed / that the end of the world was
nyghe / by the signs that our lord says in the gospel / ffor pestylences and
famynes were great on therthe / ferdfulnes of heaven tremblyng of therthe in
many places and many other things there were that ought to fere the hertes of
men to draw them fro evil / and to bring to them the remembrance of our lord
/ But they were as deef and blind of heeryng and of seey^g / this that was
nedeful to them for to save their sowles / The princes and the barons burnt
and destroyed the contrees of their neighbors / if any man had saved any
thing in their keeping / their own lords took them and put them in prison and
in grievous tormentis for to take fro them such as they had / in such wise
that the children of them that had been rich men / men might see them goo fro
door to door for to beg and get their bread / and sum deye for hungre and
mesease / As to the chirches ne Religyouses they kept not their priuyleges ne
none other fraunchyses / but were taken fro them all that mocht be founden as
well meobles. rentes. and other things / ye the crosses chalyces and the
sensours they took fro the chirches / and molt^ them for to selle / if any
fled to the church for to warante and save him / he was taken and drawn out
vylaynously as out of a tavern or an other place / To Monks and clerks were
done wrongs and all the shames they might / There was no justice / but on them
that trespaced not ne forfayted nothing / The contrees were full of thieves and
of murdriers / In cytees ne in good towns was noman sure / There reigned
customably dronkenship / lecherye / playeng at dyse and roberyes / there was no
marriage kept / ne lignage / And also as of evil life were the clerks or werse
/ as the other / The bishops ne the other prelates durst not reprehende ne
chastyse none for their evil works / The Rentes of holy church they gaf ne
paid none / but sold the benefices / And fynably I say you that all evil
works had surprysed all crystiente / in such wise that it seemed that
eueryche did pain for to serve the devil /

Of a bataylle that the emperor Romayne of Constantynople had against a puissaunt
prince of thoryent named Belphet cao. xo.
oWr lord that by his pity chastyseth in this world for to spare in that other
/ and can well beat his children that he loves for to save them suffered a great
flawe to come in to the contre for to chastyse the people / ffor in this time
when the emperor Romayn was lord in constantynoble / issued out of the parties
of thoryent a puissant hethen prince named Belphet. which brought with him so
great ple^te of people out of perse and surye that they couerd all the co^tre /
and the multitude was so great that it might not well be no^bred they brought
with them ca^tes / Charyottes / horses^ camels / beuffes / kyen / and other
small beestys so great plente / that uneath it might be byleuyd / and with
this great apparayl / This great force and strength he brought in to thempire
of constantinoble / and began to take and waste all that he fo^de / and where
as they fond fortresses cytees or castellis they took it al with assault /
ffor nothing might resist e them. but that they smote all down to therthe / all
the pepl hool fled to fore him / this tidings came to the emperor that this
great lord had supprised and taken all his contre / anon without taryeng he
sent all about in thempire. and did then^e somone all his host and assembled
as much people as he could get / and as much good as ^e might fine for this
work that was so great / when his people were comen he issued with as many men
of arm^s and of war as (...) might have / and drew to that part where this
bel^^^t came he fond him to sone as he that was far entered in to the land /
when they knew that each of them was so nygh other / they ordained th^y^
bataylles for to fight / and assembled so cruelly and of so great ang^^ as
people that had each to other great hate. The he^hen fought for tenhaunce their
law and for tencrece their power ^ and the christian men defended their faith
and the law of Ihesu criste and to save and ke^e their lives and franchyses
and their wives / childeren and their contree / The bataylle was much great
and cruelle. much people sla^n ^ blood shadde here and there At last the
greeks might not suffer the faytes ne the great plente of the mescreau^s and
f^edde as discomfyted so fowle^ that none returned agayn^ but ran awa^ with
out ordenau^ce euerych^where he might best save him they that followed them
did all that they would. They slew many* and took great plente a live. And
emonge all other The Emperor was taken him self / when tydinges came in to the
contre that the batayl was loste^ and the emperor taken / there was great sorrow
of all tholde men. wives / and childeren that had not ben there / belphet this
pryn^ce of myscreauntes seeing that he had thus plain victory of the christian
men^ mounted and aroos in to great pride / ffor he thought well that he should
find no bar that should letee him to do his will in thempyre. when he was
lodged and his host about him / he commanded the emperor to be brought to fore
him which had be taken in the bataylle / and he set his foot upon the neck
of the emperor / and this did he often and when he should mount upon horsbak or
descend / in shame and despite of the faith of our lord and of the christian
people When he had thus a while shamed reuyled and despyted the emperor He let
him goo and delyuerd him and some of his barons / that had he prisoners / and
when the emperor was come again in to constantynoble / the barons of the land
reputed him as ouermoche dishonored / as he that had shamefully conduyted the
bataille and took him and raced out his eyes and let him use his lif in sorrow
and shame This prince belphet began to take all the land in such wise that
in a lytil while he co^querd fro the lystes of surye unto the sea called the
braas of saint george / which is well xxx iourneyes of length / and x of bread
/ and in some place xv / and when he came to the braas / he would have passed in
to constantinoble / which is on that other side of that litil see / but he
might not find shippis ynowgh / Thus the christian people of that land for their
sins were under this cruel people / among the other the noble and hye cite
where saint peter was and made first as chyef of cristente / that is antioche
was taken in the end and subgette unto the turks / thus had this belphet in
his seygnorye and demayne the lands named celessurye / the two cilices /
pamphylee / lyce^ lycarne / cappadoce galace / bethuye and a part of the less
asye / all thise countries ar much fertile and full of people / this hethen people
began to beat down the chirches and grieve the christian people as it plesyd them /
ffor so great affraye and dread was in the hertes of the christian people / that
they all fled vj iourneyes fro the said belphet / this was a thing that
greuyd merueylously the holy cite of Iherusalem and the people of the country /
ffor whiles the emperor of constantynoble was in good pees and in his great
power / many great socours great comfort of rich yeftes and of large almesses
cam^ unto the people of surye / and also fro the land of antioche. But then
they had lost all. and had none hope that ever any aid ne socours should come
to them / wherefore they supposed ever to be in seruage and captyuite without any
rau^son

Of many manners of tormens that the christian people suffered for their sins / in
that time / capitulo xjo.
Whiles that this time was so peryllous for the seygnorye of these hethen men /
came oftymes in pylgremages the greeks and the latyns in to Iherusalem / ffor to
pray our lord and cry him mercy / that he would not forgete thus his people.
yet many came theder in great peril. ffor all the countrees by which they
should pass were full of their enemies / and often they were robbed and slain /
And when they might escape and come to the holy cite / they might not enter
therein. But each person must pay a besaunt for trybute. whereof happed often
that they that were despoylled had not whereof they might pay this trybute /
and might not enter in to the town / And for this they suffered Cold / hungre /
and great mesease / And many deyde. And hereof the Casten men of the town were
much grieved / For they sustained them that lived / And must burye them that
were deed / and sec^e such thing as was nedeful to them self and other / They
that might enter in the town were yet more grieved / ffor some were murdered in
the holy places of the cite secretly / and was done to them much (...) and
repreef openly^ There was fyl the cast in their visage and other spytte in the
mids of their visage / and some men bette them / w^erfore the christian men of
the town that had some acqueyntau^ces with the hethen men conduyted and ladde
them to th^yr p^lgremages for to keep them to their power. There were in the
cite of them of Malfe which is a cite of puye^l which had a church in (...)
n^med saint marye de la latyne whereby was an hospital of ^ou^e people. where
as was a chapel that was named saint John ^l^^mont / This saint Johan was a
patriark^ of All^^andr^^ (...) of the church of our lady had in his cure and

There were receyuyd all the pour pylgryms which had not w^erof ^^^yue / And
this hows was of much gre^e cha^yte Thus were ^f ^^ccisten people in great
disease in the town / But there was nothing that displesyd them. as when they
had made their deuocion^ (...) holy places in the town with great traueylles

the chalyces / brake the lamps / and the tapres / and yet for more to anger
the christian people / they took often the patriarch which was the^^ne by the herd

How aftir the had been four CCCClxxxx year in seruage of the hethen people / our
lord pourueyed remedy for his christian people / capitulo xij
i Have well said to you before / that out of many lands came pilgryme in to
Ihrlm / among all other there was one which was of the royame of ffrance born in
the bisshopprych of Amyens That is to were / one named peter which had been an
heremyte in a wode / And therefore he was called peter theremyte / this was a
litil man of body and as a person had in despite and lytil preysed by
semblaunt / But he was of a merueyllous great heart / of much clear engyne /
and good understanding / and spak right well / when he came to the gate of
Iherusalem / he paid the trybute of a besau^t and entered in to the cite / and
was lodged in a good christian man's hows / This petre alwey inquired and
demanded much of his host of the governance and estate of the cite / And
how the christian men contained them under the hethen men / And how their lord
demened and governed them / his host which had long ben in the town / told
to him all the manner plainly of the times passyd. And how the cristent^ had be
defowled / And the holy places dishonored / which was sorouful to here / And
he him self which a good while had be in the town for to do his pylgremage /
saw well and perceived a great party of the caityfnes / in which the christian
men were / he herd say that the patriarch was a good wise man deuote and
religyous which was named symeon / Peter thought that he would goo and speak
with him / and demand of him the estate of the chirches of the clergy and of
the people / he came to him and did so as he though^ And asked of him all thise
things / The patriarch apperceyued well by his words and his cou^tinaunce /
that he was a man that dredde god / and right wise and understanding / And
began to tell to him by layser / all the meseases of the christian people. when
peter herd thise sorrows of the mouth of this good man whom he byleuyd well
could not absteyne him fro great syghes / and weeping many teeres for pity / and
often d^ma^ded of the patriarch if there were any co^seil and remedy for this
work / and the holy and deuote patriarch answered hym^ we have made many
orysons and prayers unto our lord god for to receive us in to his mercy and
grace. But we apperceyue well / that our sins be not yet purged / ffor we ben
certainly in the culpe and blame. when our lord which is so rightwys holds
us yet in the pain. But the reno^me of the contrees by yonde the montaynes is
much great here. that the people there and specially of them of ffraunce ben
good christian people and much steadfast in the faith. And therefore our lord
holds them at this day in much great peace and in hye puissance / if they
would pray our lord that he would have pity on us / or that they took counseyl
for to socoure us / we have certainly hope that our lord should help us by them
for taccomplysshe our work. ffor ye see well that the greeks and the emperor of
Constantinoble which ben our neighbors and as kynnesmen may not help ne
counseyle us / ffor they them self ben as who says destroyed / And have no
power to defend their own land / When peter herd this / he answered in this
manner / fair fader truth it is. that ye have said / ffor of that land am I^
And god be thanked / the faith of our lord is much better holden there and
kept / than it is in any other lands that I have been in. sith that I departed
on my Iourneye fro my contre / And I believe certainly that of the mescase and
seruage in which thise hethen mysbyleuyd people hold you Inn / that by the
playsyre of almighty god by their good wylles they should find cou^seyl and
aid in this your great need and work / wherefore I counseyl you one thing if it
be aggreable to you and seem good / that is that ye send your lettres unto
our holy fader the pope and to the church of rome unto the kings princes and
barons of the occident and weste part / In which late them wete plainly how it
is with you / and that ye cry to them for mercy / that they would socoure you
for the love of god and for his faith in such manner / that they might have
honor in this world and sauaco^n of their souls in that other / and for that
ye be pour people / ye have no need to make great dispe^cis / if ye think I be
sufficiaunt for so great a message / ffor the love of Ihu Criste and remyssyon
of my sins I shall entreprise this vyage and offer my self to take so much
traueyl for you / And I promise truly to you that I shall late them have
knowleche / how it is with you / if god send me grace to come thydre / when
the patriarch herd this / he had much great joy / he sent anon for the most
saddest and wysest men of the christian pepl and for the clerks and lay men and
said and shewde to them the bounte and the seruyse. that this good man offryd
to them / They were right glad / And thanked him much / Then anon without
taryenge / they made their wrytynges and sealed them with their seals / and
delyuerd them to peter theremyte /

How the said peter theremyte entreprised the more hardyly his vyage by
thapparico^n or vision that he saw in his sleep / ca xiijo.
tRuly our lord god is sweet / pyteous / and mercyful / ffor he will not
suffer to perysshe / ne to be lost / them that have in him ferme and steadfast
hope / And when the men lack help / god sends to them his aid / And this
may clearly be seen in this work / for fro whens comes that this pour man /
which was lytil and despised person weary and bruised of so great Iourneye and
way / that durst enterprise so great a deed and work / how might he wene
that our lord would accomplysshe so great a work by him / as for to dylyure
his people fro the myserye and caytyfnes that they had been in nygh five C year /
But this hardynesse came to him of the great charity that he had in him / And
the faith wrought in him for the love that he had to his brethren / In thise
days happed a thing / that much lift up his heart to poursue his enterprise
/ ffor this good man / when he had taken this message and charge thereof / he
went much ofter than he was woonte to do to the holy places in the cite. and
came on an euentide to the church of the holy sepulcher. and made there his
prayers devoutly with great plente of teeris / Aftir this he sleepte upon the
pamente / and him seemed that our saueour Ihesu Criste came to fore him and
charged him self to do this message / And said to him petre arise up hastily /
and goo surely thedyr as thou have entreprysed / ffor I shall be with the / It
is now time from hens forth / that my holy Cite be cleansed / and that my people
be socoured / Petre awoke in this point And was fro than forthon more
abandouned unto the way and also sure as his Iourneye and message had be done
/ he entermed and appointed his departing for to do his erande / And had leave
and benediction of the patriarch / he descended down to the sea / and fond
there a ship of merchants that would pass in to puylle / he entered in to the
ship / the which had good wind and in short time arrived at bar / peter
issued out and went by land to rome he fond in the contre the pope urban /
and salewed him in the name of the Patriarch and of the christian people of Surye
and delyuerd to him their lettres / and said to him by mouth much truli and
wisely the great sorrows the miseryes and vyletees that the christian suffered
then in the holy land / as he that was expert thereof / and could well say to
him the truth

Of the persecucions of the church in that time / and how the pope Urban was
put out of the sea of Rome by the bishop of Rauenne / cao.xiiij
iN this time Harry the emperor of Allemayne had a great debate against the pope
Gregory the seventh to fore this Urban / and the discord aroos for the rings
and the croses of the bisshoppes that were deed in thempyre / For such a
customme had run a great while there that when the prelates were deed the
rings and croses of them were brought to the emperor / And (...) gaf them to
his clerks and his chapylayns or whom he would (...) sent to the chyrches and
bad them that they shoolde hold them for their bisshops and archebisshops
without other election and o^ther proef / by which holy church was adommaged
sore / For he sent often perso^nes / that were not propice thereto / The pope
grego^^^ saw that this customme was against the right and law (...) and also
against reason / and prayed him amyably to leave this (...) the love of god of
holy church and for sauacion of his soul (...) it apperteyned nothing to him
/ The Emperor would not leu^ (...) for the pope / wherefore the pope cursed him
hereof the emperor had so great despite and so gtete desdayne / that moontine^t
he began to wa^^^ against the church of rome / and against the pope he made to
rise an ad^uersarye / Tharchiebisshop of rauenne which was named Gilbert and
was well lettred and much rich / This bishop trusted ouermoch^ in thayde of
the emperor / And in the plente of his richesse ^ And he came to rome / and
deposed and put out the pope of his se^ by favor and force / And becam so fell
and of so gre^e pride that he had that he forgate his wit and reason that he
ought to have by his clergy / And set him self in the sea / And made him to
be holden for pope as he that well wend to have been it ^ I have said you to
fore ^ that at that time / Christian people were in great paryll thurghout allthe
world / and that the comandemens of the gospel were much forgoten / and of
holy church / And men ran fast and habou^dantly to the works of the devil
and to allsynnes / and when this discord and Scysme was so great / Then all
truth was goon and the faith of our saueour was like as it had been all
perysshed / The bysshoppes / the abbottes and the prouostes were beten and
set in prison / And all their things were taken awey fro them namely by
them that held of the emperor / In this debate was done all the shames and
repreues to the pope / Then the holy fader saw that he was not obeyed as he
should be / and that he was in paryl of his life / And he went in to puylle / by
the help and counseyl of Robert guichart / which then was lord of the
contre / This Robert did unto our holy fader / and to his people as much of
honor of servyse and bounce as they would take and yet more / at last on: holy
fader went him in to salerne / and becam seek and lay down and there deyde /
and was there buried / The Cardynals that were there Chose another which was
named viator / which endured but one month or there aboutes After him they
choos this urban that I spack of to fore / This urban saw that the emperor was
yet in his ma^^ce and his anger / and durst not abandone to him ne put him in
his power / but held him in the forteresses of some barons that for gods
sake retryned him in great doubt / whiles he was in this point / peter
theremyte came to him / and brought to him the message fro the Christian men in
the holy land / our holy fader the pope knew much well / the bounte / the
wit / and the religion that was in this peter / And / ansuerd to him much
swetly and said that he should goo hastyly speak to the princes and barons of
the royame of ffrannce of this work / for if he might escape sauely fro the
hands of the emperor he him self had Intencion to pass the montaygnes / and
draw him toward tho parties for to help the better to this wherke / if it
were possible / Then peter was right glad of this good answer of our holy
fader / and passed lombardye and the montaygnes and came in to ffrance / And
began diligently to get the barons like as he was sent expressly to them / and
told to each of them the shames and disconvenyences that the hethen people did
to the Christian folk in the holy land / And the same he said to the mean people

land and Cite of Irlm / in such wise that he made them to weep many a t^ere /
And at every time he made some fruit by his saying and exhortyng the people to
give socours to the holy land / And like wise as saint John baptyste preched
to fore to make the way to fore Ihu^ christ / so in the same wise this Peter
brought tidings to fore the coming of our holy fader / wherefore he him self
when ^he came was the lecter he^d and byleuid / and the more did in this work

Of a general counseyl that the pope urban ordained for the reformacion of holy
church and thamendement of the people / capo. xvo.
iN the year of thyncarnacion of our lord M.lxxxxv. reigned the fourth harry
king of almayn and emperor of Rome / the xviij year of his regne / and the
xij of his Empire and In frannce reigned then philipe the sone of harry /
Then^e saw our holy fader the pope urban that the world was much empeyred and
turned to evyl / and held a counseyl there upon of the prelates of ytalye at
playsance / where he made establysshemens by their counseyl for tamende the
manners of the Clergy and of the lay people / After he knew well that he was
not sure in the power of the emperor / and passed the montaygnes and came in to
the royame of frannce / he fond the people evil endoctryned / and ouermoche
enclyned to synne-Charite faylled / and wars and discordes were emonge the
rich men / And thought that it was need to do his power and might for tamende
Cristiente / he ordained a general counseyl of all the prelates that were
between the montaynes and the sea of England / this counseyl was set first
at Clony / Another time at puy^^r^e dame / And the third time at Cleremont in
anuergne / This was in the month of Nouembre / There were many Archebisshops /
bisshops / abbotes / and great prelates and persons of holy church of thise
parties There were by the general counseyl many coumandements given for ^^mende
clerks and layefee / for teshewe sins / and recou^re good manners / There was
holy church al reformed of which it had great need / Emonge all other Peter
theremyte was there which forgate not the work that he was charged with / but
admonesced the prelates each pryuatly by him self and prayde the comune people
openly much well and wisely / Then took our holy fader the words and showed
generally to all the counseyl / what great shame it was to all the christian
men of our faith / that was so nyghe destroyed y^d and faylled in the place
where it began / and it might be great fere and dread when it faylled at the
heed and well / that the ryve^^ should not endure / that were rennyng through
the world / And said much well that all the very Cryst^n people should take
hereof great despite of thus desheryted by their defaulte / and his contre
d^l^uerd to his enemies / And promised that if they wol^e took upon this
pylgremage. he would change their penance in to this werke^ And if they deyde
in this way confessid and repentaunt^ he would take it on his faith. that they
incontinent should goo in to the Joy of heaven. On that other side as long as
they were in the seruyse of our lord. they were in the ward and keeping of holy
church. both they and their things in such wise that they that did to them
any damage. should be acursed. and all this commanded he to be kept of all the
prelates that were at cou^seyl. This done he gaf every man leave. and
commanded should preche this pylgremage and pardon. And told to them that all
men should trauayll to give and make long trewes and pees of the wars for
tacco^plysshe the better this pylgremage and to perform it.

How many noble and hye men and other of the Royame of fraunse crossed them for
to goo over see. ca xvjo.
oWr lord gaf his grace unto our holy fader the pope in vtteryng of the word of
god^ which was said in such wise. that it was fyxed and roted in the hertes of
them that herd him. and not only of them that were present. but of all other
that it was recorded and told unto. ffor the bisshops went in to their
countrees and preched to their people like as it was to them commanded How be it
that it was a strange thing and right grievous for a man to leave his contree.
his wife. his childeren / and lygnage. And leave them that he loves by nature.
But when one thinks what reward he shall have of our lord so to do. then he
geteth a fervent love in him self for the charity of our lord. and leueth the
naturel love of his flessh. for to save his soul / and this might well be
perceived and s^en. ffor the people of the Royame of ffraunce and the great
barons and other less that were enclyned to sins and acustomed to do ylle
as I have said to fore. aftir they herd this prech^^g. entreprysed so
vygorously the work of our lord and auowed them to ward this pylgremage as ye
shall here. ffor it seemed that every man ought to entreprise tauenge the wrong
and shame that the hethen did to our lord and to his people in the land of
Iherusalem. Ye should have seen the husbonde depart fro his wife. And the faders
fro the childeren. and the childeren fro the fadres. And it seemed that every
man would depart fro that he louyd best in this wrold / for to win the Joy
of that other / There was so great affraye and so great a meuyng through all the
land that uneath ye should have found an hows / but that some had enterprised
this viage / I say not that all that went were wise and of pure entencion
toward our lord / ffor some monks went out of their cloystres without leave of
their abbottes or pryours / and the recluses went out of the places where they
had been closed in / and went forth with the other / Some went forth for love
of their friends to bear them felawship / Other went forth for bobaunce les^
they should be reputed for evil and not good / And some there were that would
withdraw them for their creancers and have respite of their dettes / But how
that it was their entencions within their hertes semyd good for the great
enterprise that they showed outward / And it was of great need that this
pylgremage was chosen at that time / ffor there were in the world so many
sins that they withdrewe the people / fro our lord / And it was well behoueful
that god should send to them some addressement by which they might come to
heaven / and that he gaf them some traueylle as it were a purgatory to fore
their death / At this counseyl auowed presently this pylgremage the good bishop
of Puy named Aymart / which aftirward was legate in the same host / and
contained him much wisely and truly / Also the bishop of Orange whi he was an
holy man and relygyous auowed t^ere the same viage / And ynowhe of other which
were not at that counseyl that enterprised the same vow / Our holy fader had
commanded / and made the bisshops to hold it / that all they that would auowe
this pylgremage should set the sign of the cross on their right sholdre /
ffor thonoure of him that bare the torment of the cross upon his sholders for
to save us / and taccomplysshe this that our lord says in the gospel / Who
that will live aftir me / renye him self and take the cross and follow me / well
forsakes he him self that leueth / that the flessh loves / for saving of his
soul / when one of the great barons was croysed so on his sholdre in a contre.
all the people of the contre that were also crossyd came to him and chees him
for their captain and made to him feaulte for to have his aid and warantise
in the way of the said pylgremage /

neuew. his sustres sone. and many other great barons of this land that were
not so renommed ne known as thise were There was great Appareyllemens and
array that was made for this pylgremage. The great men had enterprised that
as soon as the winter was passed they would put them on this pylgremage^ The
mean people. the knyghtes^ the barous. and other aftir they were acqueynted that
one with that other / sent to each other lettres and messages for taccorde to
goo to gydre / and appointed the time of departing. and of the way that they
should hold / And when March was come. ye should have seen horses arrayed
with sommyers palfroyes and stedes / tents and pauyllons^ and to make armures.
ye may well know that there was much to do of many things. ffor the barons
were acorded that they should not goo all to gydre. ffor no contre might
suffyse ne find that which should be nedeful for them / ffor which cause all
the hoostes neuyr assembled as ye shall here till they came unto the cite of
Nycene. The mean people charged them self not much with tents ne Armures. ffor
they might not bear it. And therefore every man garnysshid him aftir that he was
with money and goods as much as he supposed should be nedeful for him. When
the day of departing came there were great sorrows great wepynges and great
cries at departing of the pylgryms / ffor there were but few howses but of
them some went / And such howsholders there were / that they went all and
carried their wives and bare their childer^n with them / It was a merueyllous
thing to see this meuynges / ffor it had not before be acustomed to see such
things in france / ne never before was cross born ne taken for pylgremage

Of thauentures that a Rowte of Christian men had in this viage / Of whom one
Gaultyer without knowleche / was Captain / capitulo xviijo
tHe year of thyncarnacion of our lord. M. four score xvj / the eght day of
March came a gentilman a knight right noble named Gaultier without knowleche to
his surname. with him came a merueyllous great plente of folk a foot. ffor there
were but few men a horse bak in this rowte / they passed in allemayne and drew
hem toward hongrye / The Royamme of hongrye was all enuyronned with great
waters and large mers^^s and deep lakes in such wise that none might enter ne
issue but by certain ^laces and strayt entrees that been as yates of the londe^
In hongerye was then a king a much valiant man named Coleman^ / And was a
very good christian man / He knew that Gaultier came by land with great people /
and had thereof much great Joy / and held well with the pylgremage that he had
en^erprised be received them debonayrly in his land. and commanded through his
royame that they should have all manner vytaylle good sheep* and all that they
neded / The pylgryms passed all hongrye in good peace till they came to the end
where they found a wace: which was named Marce / This was the bound of
hongerye toward th^^yent^ they passed this water in good peace. and entered in to
^ongrye. And witthoute knowing of this Gaulteer some of his people abode ou^^
the water / And came to a castle named Malleuylle. for to by vitaylles of the
which they had need. The hongres by cause that all the host was passed sauf
they which were but a few. run upon them / And bette them / And did to them
ouermoche shame^ They passed the water and came to gaultier / and shewde to him
plainly how they had been demened without forfa^^ce: They had much great
despite and much sorrow hereof. And had passed the water agayn^ if they had had
not so great peril and so great distourblyng^ And thought they would goo their
way and leave for tauenge this thing / So long they went till they came to
belle graue^ which is the first Cite of bongrye on this syde^ Gaultier sent
to the duc of the town and required him that he would late them there by
vytaylles / he would not suffer any to be sold to them Thoost had great disease
for lak of vytaylle / and might not longer keep them. but that a great part of
them went a fowragyng for to get vytaylles for them and for their beestys /
They found great plente of beestes in the contre / which they took and
brougkt to their lodgyngee / when they of the contre herd this. they armed them
and assembled great people of the country. and ran upon them where they droef
their proyes and fought with them / and took the beestes fro them / and many of
them they slew. and hu^ted the other away the no^bre well of Cxl of onre men
shytte them in a monasterye for to keep them there sauf / but the bo^gres came
there about / and set fire on the church and burnt all / Gaultier saw
that he led with him many folyssh people which he could not rule ne set
all in ordenau^ce / And withdrewe him fro them and took them that would be
ruled and obey him and went in to forestes of bongrye which ben large and
long and began to pass the most wisely and still that he might / till he came
to a cite named stralyce / and is a contre named danemarche the moyen / There
fond he a good man that was duke of the land / when this duke knew what they
were and whyther they went / he received them much debonayrly. and made them
to have vytaylles and other things good cheep. And did to them bountes and
seruyses ynowgh for the oultrage that was done to them at belgraue. And did
redress and yield again to them as much as he might recouere / and above
all this / he delyuerd to them good conduyte and sew^ till they came to
constantynoble / when they were come to constantinoble the emperor sent for
gaulteer. he came unto him and said to him thoccasion of his viage and that he
would abide there peter theremyte. by the commandemt of whom he had brought
these pylgryms / when the emperor herd this / he received him mochewel and
swetly / and assygned to him a fair place without the town / where as he lodged

How Pieter the heremyte was chyef of a great host in this viage toward the
holy londe^ capitulo xixo.
it was not long aftir that peter theremite came fro his contre / with great
plente of people unto the nombre of xl / M / he came in to lorayne. and passed
francone / bauyere^ osterych / and drew him toward hungrye. Peter sent his
messagers to the king of hongrye to the end that he might pass his Royamme. he
sent him word that he should have good leave if they would goo in peace without
medlynges and oultrages / They answered that they were pylgryms of our lord /
and had no talente for to trouble the pees / Thus entered they the royamme of
hongrye / and passed by the land without any debate. vytaylles and other
things had they enough good che^pe / At the end they came to the castle of
which I spak to fore / named maleuylle: There herd they say / what was done
to them of the retenne of Gaultier and the great oultrage done to them without
cause / and saw yet the arms and despoyllis of their felaws that had be
robbed there hang yet on the walls /

Our pylgryms that saw this were all as they had been out of their wit and
ran to arms / and began every man to do well. they took the town by force^ and
smote of the heedes of all them that were within sauf a few which ran in to
the water and were drowned^ there were found of them that were deed well a four
M / and of ^eters meyne were slain an C / when this was don the host fo^de
there great plente of vytaylles / and abode well v days in that place / The duc
of bongrie which was named Iucita understood how thise pilgryms had venged
their felaws against them of maleuylle and doubted for as much as he had
defended the vytaylles to our people and that he had slain many of them. And him
seemed that bellega^^ne was not strong enough / therefore he left the town / and
went in to a strenger castle / Thus all they of the cite issued with their
goods / and drew them to the deep forestes / Peter whiles he lay yet at
maleuylle herd say that the king of hongrye had herd of the death of his people
/ whereof he was much angry / and that he somoned and assembled all his power
for tauenge his men that had be slain / And doubted thereof / And was no
merueylle / wherefore he made tassemble all the ships that might be founden
at ryue of the sea to him / and made his people to depart much hastily his
carts and charyottes / and the beestes they had merueyllous great pray and
lad awey great rychesses fro the castle of maleyulle that they had there taken
when they were passed over in to hongrye^ they came to fore bellegraue / and
fond the cite all void. ffor they were all fled / Aftir they went eght
great iourneyes by many great forestes till they came to fore a cite named Nyze /
This town fond they much strong and well wallyd with great towers and strong
/ And within was great garnyson and the best men of war of all the land
and great plente of armours and vytaylle / Peter the heremyte and his host
fond a brygge of stone by which they passed a water rennyng nyghe to the cite
/ they passed the brygge and lodged them between the water and the town. And
by cause they had not mete enough / Peter sent his messages unto the lord of
the town / and prayed him fair for him and for his people that were christian / and
pylgryms that went in the seruyse of our lord / that they might bye vytaylles
of the town at reasonable prys / Then^e the lord send word to peter that he
would not suffer / that they should enter in to the town / But and if he would
give him good ostages / that his people should do no harm ne oultrage to the
people and marcheaunces of the town that should come for to selle them vytaylle /
he should send to them enough at reasonable prys^ when Peter and his people herd
this they were glad enough. They delyuerd good ostages / and anon they of the
town came out with great plente of vytayl and other things necessary in the
host /

How some of the oost of peter theremyte vnwetyng him set fire in the
subarbes of Nyz at their departing / capo. xxo.
much was this night the host of the pylgryms refresshyd of all things that
they had need / ffor they had been long fro any good town. And they of the cite
were to them much debonair and reasonable. On the morn they demanded their
ostages / And they were delyuerd gladly / And forth they went in peace. But now
ye shall here how the devil does great pain for to empesshe and let good
works / In this company had been the even a fore a stry^ to one of the
marcchau^tes of the town / and some of the oost / when the host was departed
the duchemen assembled to the nombre of an hunderd. and for vengeance of the
stryf / they saw vij myllenes^ which stood at brygge nyghe the town / and
set them a fire and burnt them anon / this was not ynowgh. but there was a
litil borough without the cite / and they set that a fire also and brende hit
to ashes / and sith went their way aftir their felawship which knew
nothing hereof / Of this thing the lord of the town which had the even to fore
shewde to them great d^^^nayrte was gretely meuyd for he saw that they rendrid
evil for god and was half out of his wit for anger / This felonnye that this
few did was wyted all the host. which was evil and pyte^ he made anon arm
all the town and issued on horsbak and on foot / him self came to fore / and
prayde and much desired his people for to venge upon these false rowters and
theuys the oultrage that they had don. when they approached the host / they
fond first thise three malefactors which had not yet overtaken their felaws /
And run on them and smote of their heedes / it had the^ / ne be ynowgh. but
they were not content^ but smote in the aftirst part of thoost which doubted
nothing / they fond charyottes / sommyers / males^ seruauntes^ wymmen and
childrren / which might not goo so fast as the other / They slew many and
sum they ouerthrewe and ladde away the carriage. And thus returned in to their
cite without hurt and all blody of the blood of the pylgryms.

How Peter theremyte was aduertysed of all this. And of the harm that
ensiewed / capitulo xxio.
pEter was going with the great company when a messager came to him rydyng and
told to him of this adventure that was fallen in the taylle of thoost^ Peter
sent anon to them that were to fore that they should return again the way
that they were common unto the cite of nyz / In this return they fond things
ynowgh that displesyd them. ffor they fond their felawes by^eded lyeng by the
way / they had great sorrow hereof On^ fond his fader deed / Another his
brother. or his sone. and another his wife or his daughter / there were many
disconuenyents. Peter which had his entencion pure unto our lord / entented
not but ca^^ese the malice and leye down the discord which was sourded among
the people / he sent some wise and prudent men to the lord and to the most hye
men of the cyte^ for to demand by what occasion they had don this evil and
crueltees against the people of our lord / They answered that this was by the
defaulte of the pilgrim / and that they had first done great oultrage to
brenne their mylne^ and burghe. when Peter and the wise men that were with him
herd this / They thought well that it was no place ne time to venge their shames
And therefore turned the matter unto peace and acorde / for to recounre the pray
the prysonners and Caryage which they had led away fro thoost / ffor there
were of the mean people which would not be ruled and would not suffer them of the
town to have pees with us / but would aneuge by force the oultrage that they
had done / Peter felt this thynge^ And apperceyued anon the euylle that
sourded / And sent of the wysest and grettest of his company to make the pees
/ his people would not have pees^ He made a cry on pain of death in his name and
the name of the barons / that noman be so hardy to break the pees that was made
And this he charged upon their pylgremages their feaulte and on thobedyence
that they had promised him / And when they of the host herd this / they
remeuyd not / But folyssh people went forth and made great noise and would not
obey. The messagers that were in the town for taccorde this that was don saw
that the noise grew more and more and returned to their felawshhip without
any conclusion or doing that they had enterprised / and did their best to
seece the debate / but they had no power ffor there were moo than a thousend
pylgryms which noman might hold ne reteyne / But that they would goo armed to
the town. Out of the town issued as many or moo against them there began the
bataylle and the meddle great and thyk and began to slay each other largely /
Peter ne his route meuyd not / but byhelde the bataylle. They of the town that
were on the walls and at wyndowes saw that their people had the werse and
apperceyued that the great power of thoost entermeted not of this war and
thought that they would not help them / And opened their yates and issued out
by great rowtes all armed and smote in the bataylle / And found of our people
about a / v / C. upon the brygge / And addressyd to them and slew them alle^
sauf sum that were cast in the water / And all were perysshed. when the
great host apperceyued their people thus evil demened. they might suffer it no
longer. but went to Arms / and smote in to the bataylle / one aftir another
like as they might be armed^ the people that had bygonne this debate were
discomfyted first / And began to flee so fast that nothing might tarry them /
They began to beat them an horsbak that came for to help them / by which the
good men were discomfyted / And they of the Cite that were nygh to their
retrayt began to chase them much straytly and to slay them / At last when our
people were withdrawn / they returned by the Caryage and harnoys / And carried
all and led it with them. And took wymmen and childeren that might not flee
and put them in prison. There were well slain and lost of the people of the
host / x / M / and the bongres wan all the harnoys of thoost / There was a
cart lost that longed to peter theremyte all full of Rychess^ which had been
youen to him in ffrau^ce for to soconre and sustene the necessytees of the
host / they that might escape fro this discomfiture. drew them in to the
forestes / and hid them in the deep valeyes in the night / And on the morn
they began to call each other / and to whystle and sown trumpes and busynes
in the woods. And thus began to reassemble and gadred them to gydre on a
territory

How The Emperor of Constantynoble being advertised of thise oultrages sent his
messagers to peter theremyte / cao. xxijo.
aT the fourth day were nyghe all assembled about peter. And they were about
a four thousand^ they were in much great meschyef as they that had lost their
friends and their people and almost all their harnoys / not withstondyng they
left no^ but went forth on the way that they had en^erprised with great
me^sease and pain for lak of vytaylle. And as they were in this point. They
saw come against them the messagers of the emperor of constantynoble which spak
to peter / And anon he did assemble the heye men and Capytayns of the host
for to ^ere (...) message that they brought^ And aftir they said in this manner
ffayr syrs^ much evil tidings and renomme is comen of you to our lord
the emperor / ffor it is told to him that ye goo by the country of his empire
with force. and rob the people of such as they have break his towns and slay
his people / and do all the oultrages and wrongs that ye may / the good chere
/ bounce. and all the seruyse that is done to you auaylleth nothing ne may
adoul^e ne aswage your hertes / Therefore he commande^h you that ye abide in
none of his cytees more than three days / But goo your way strayt forth to
constantynoble / ffor he has commanded us to goo with you / and that we do
bring to you on the way vytayll good cheep ynowe. when thise good men herd
this that the emperor ha^ don to them this bou^te / they had great joy / and
excused them of th^se bataylles and fyghtyng and showed openly. what the bongres
had done without their offense or culpe by force and great oultrag^ The
messagers dyrected them on the way till they came to constantynoble / They fond
there gaultyer sans sauoyr / and his people that tarried for them / And then
they went all to ggdre / And lodged them in the place that was assygned to
them / And there each told to other of their mysauentures: The Emperor sent
for peter. And he went to him / He saw in the town many things / palaysses
many rychesses / and marueylles / But he was a man of great heart and courage
and abashed of nothing / The Emperor demanded of him of thestate of his people
and of other barons of tho^c^yent / that were thus meuyd to this pylgremage.
Peter answered him much well of all things / And said that they were pour
people and were come to fore / But the princes and hye men came aftir with much
great people / which would not long tarry / the emperor and his barons of the
palace saw all that peter was so lytil. And so well / so wisely / so fair and
so well appoint of all things answered that they merueylled over much / and
allowed and preysed him much. The Emperor gaf to him great yeftes / And received
him in his grace / And sith he let him return to his people. There rested the
oost of the pylgryms well at ease and in peace / And a while aftir ships were
made ready by the commandment of the emperor And they passed the sea named the
braas of saint george. And came in to the land named bythyne / This is the first
party of Asye / upon the sea / And they lodged them in a place called Cinintot

Of the mayntenyng of the host of peter theremyte / And how three thousand
duchemen took a castle by assault / and slew all that were therein with the
sword / capitulo xxiijo.
tHis was in the marches of their enemies / there was the host about two
months And every day they fond fresshe vytaylles to sell good cheep. whereof
they were well at ease^ so much that it could not well be suffered long / They
began to meue and made routes for to goo en fourage in the country / There went
well sometime.x.M / or more maulgre the barons that were capytayns in the host.
Neuetthelesse Peter commanded and sent lettres to them that they should abide
and not remeue fro the oost / to pylle till the great Princes were comen^ On a
day it happed that Pieter passed the braas / And came in to Constantynoble for
to speak for vytaylles / that began to wexe dear / The mean people saw that
Peter was not there. And were the more hardy they assembled^ and were of a
company well eght thousand a foot and three honderd a horsback. they made their
bataylles and went all in ordenau^ce toward the cite of nycene against the
will and deffence of all the great men of thoost / when they came nyghe to
this great cite. They smote in to the towns about it and took merueyllous many

without hurt home again in to the oost with great joy and feste. The
duchemen which ben a people rude and hardy saw this glory and this gain that
they had won / and had great envy thereat / and were meuid with couetyse of
good and to have wor^hip relied them to gydre all of that tongue unto the
nombre of three thousand a foot / and went strayte toward Nycene / There was a
/ Castle at foot of an hylle nygh unto Nycene at least Four mile of. These
Duchemen came theder and began tassaylle the castle much strongly / they within
defended them to their power as long as they might. but it auaylled not / ffor
the castle was taken by force / And the duchemen entered therein / And all them
that they fond within. men. wymmen and chylderen they slew without mercy /
They fo^de there in vytaylle ynowgh and other things / and saw that the ^l^ce
was much fair and delectable / and garnysshed it and said that they would it
hold till the great princes. whom they abode and tarried for were comen /

How Solomon lord of that contre reprysed and took again the castle and slew
all the duchemen that where therein cao. xxiii^o.
Solomon which was lord of this contre and gouernoure had herd long to fore /
that the christian people were me^yd of the Royamme of ffraunce for to goo in to
the land of surye And that they addressed them for to pass by his land /
Therefore he had been in thoryent fro whens he was come / and had brought great
plente of knights and other people / by whom he intended to keep his land- And
grieve his enemies / that should pass there by / he was then drawn toward our
people. and with his folks was in the montaynes and woods / He herd how this
duchemen had taken his castle and slain his men / and came the most hasty wise
be might and assyeged the castle / and took it without taryeng / and he smote
of the heedes of all them that he fond / The tydynge came in to the host that
Solomon had slain all the duchemen and their felaws / They had much sorrow
therefore / and there arroos a great cry and great weeping in the lodgys / The
people afote took hereof great despite emonge them / And began to speak shrewdly
/ And said that the barons of the oost ought not to suffer this^ But that they
should run a horsbak and avenge blood of their brethren that so nygh was shed
/ The great men of thoost that knew more of war and of other things / than
the mean people would have holden them in peace / And said this may well be yet
amended / And also the emperor counceylled / And it was truth / that they
should abide the coming of the gre^e barons which should not long tarry / The
people and the folyssh folk were not content with these words / But they had a
Capytayne named godefrey bureau. which brought them in such reuerye and
murmur that they spoke largely and rudely against the knights / And said all
clerly that they were untrue and evil. and that they let not to avenge this
by wysedom / but for great cowardyse /

How our men armed them for tauenge the duchemen. and of a recountour that
they had against Solomon / cao. xxvo.
iT happeth oftyme that the werse counseyl ouercometh the better / And it is no
meruaylle. ffor there ben more fools than wysemen These mean people and without
reason meuyd them so much and cried that the barons and other men that were
with hem ran to arms an horsbak and on foot. There were well / xxv / / M. on
foot / and / v / C / a horsbak all well arrayed / They made their bataylles /
and went forth in ordenaunce toward the montaygnes by the woods strayt toward
Nycene / They were not departed three mile when Solomon which had much people
with him apperceyued them: ffor he came all couerd and secretly in the wode /
ffor to make an assaylle / in the oost of the pylgryms / But when he herd the
noise and thaffraye in the foreste^ he wist well that they were the criste^ men
that came against him and suffered them to pass he him self with all his people
drew him incontinent out of the wode in to the plain where as they should
pass / when our people were issued they sewed them suddenly / they took none
head of him and anon with their felawship ran upon our men with their speres
and swerdes for tauenge their brethren. The hethen men saw on that other side
that certainly they would fight / and that every man did his best / received
them much fiersly / the battle began much cruelle / and many were deed on
both sides. and the bataylle dured long / But solomon had much more people on
horsbacke whom the pylgryms a foot might not longer suffer / But began to flee
without ordenaunce / and were discomfyted / The turks followed them aftir
sleeyng all them that they might atteyne / till they came to their lodgyng /
There were slain Gaultier sans sauoyr / Reygnald de broyes and ffoucher
dorleans which were good and valyau^t knights / and almost all were slain
and brought in to prison / ffor of / xxv / M men / and five honderd men on
horsbak. could not be founden three to gydre / But that they were taken (...)

How peter theremyte being in constantynoble was aduertysed of this
disconfyture / and saved three thousand christian men being in great danger
capitulo xxvio.
tHis vyctorye brought Solomon in great pride / and in great sewr^e he smote in
to the lodg^s of the Christian man / where as were left thau^cye^t people men /
wymmen clerks / and monkes^ whom he put all to death / he fond maidens and
small childeren which he led with him. for to be ever aftir in seruage. On
that one side of the tents nyghe unto the sea / was an old fortress for^eten
and beten down in which no man dwelled. ne there was fond therein door ne
wyndowe / Theder fled of the pylgryms about a t^re thousand one aftir
another for to keep their lyuess / They s^o^ed thentrees the best wise they
might with great tymbre and tree^. and with great stones / The turks knew
thereof ^ and came and be^gan tassaylle it on all sides much anguysshously ^
They de^ended them the best wey then might. ffor they had great need. wh^les
they were thus assaylled / a messager went h^stely to p^ter there ^ myte which
was in constantynoble as is said to you to fore^ This message said to him that
all his men were peryss^yd sauf a lytil remenaunt which were at great
meschief in an old hows asyeged^ which were in much great danger / if they
had not hasty socoure. Peter was much abashed / And had meruayllously great
sorrow / Nevertheless anon he ran to the emperor and fyld down at his feet
and prayed him for gods sake and for the ^auacion of his soul that he would
send socoure to this pour people that were in so great peril / that if he
hasted not / they should be all deed / The Emperor that much louyd peter sent
anon his messagers theder / and commanded the turks that ^ssay^^ed them /
should leave thassault / and depart thens / They went aweye anon when they had
herd the commandment of the emperor But they led with them prisonners yn^we
/ horses mules / and other beestes / tents / pauyllons and gonnes. and with
all they. returned in to nycene / here ye may here how so much people was
lost / by the folly of the moyen people / which would not have no endure the
governance of the wise men above them. Here may men well see that it is great
peril to trust to the bataylle or war of them / that know not of it /

How a priest named godechan made him self capytayn of / xl / / M / duchemen in
this viage and of their oultrages / cao. xxvijo.
Sith that Pieter was passed in to bythme as I have said / it was not long
aftir that a priest named Godechan had preached in duchelonde / like as peter
theremyte had done in ffrau^ce And came with his people for to goo in this
pylgremage / ffor he had well assembled / xl / M / of duchemen They entered all
in to the land of hongrye / ffor the king had commanded that they should be
received debonayrly. by cause it were his neighbors. and that they should have
vytaylle and other necessytees at prys reasonable They that fond the land
right good began to abide there all the winter / and for the case that they
had they began to wexe proud In such wise that they took away the vytaylles
and other things / and led awey the beestes out of the feeldes / they took
wives beat their husbondes and slew them / and for noman would they leave thise
oultrages / The king of the land herd the tidings of this peple^ and was
much displaysyd and was much sorry therefore / And might not with his honor no
longer suffer it lest it should torn to ouermoche hurt of his land and of his
subgettes. And did do assemble much people on horsbak and on foot for tauenge
on thise duchemen. he began to poursyewe them so far that he fond them right
in the mydle of his royame by a c^stel named bellegraue / the king had seen and
also herd of thoultrages that they had done in his land whiles he siewed aftir
them / The duchm^n knew that the king came upon them and was nyghe* and they
knew well that they had not ben well governed toward him / But had done many
ylle tornes and wrongs in his land. wherefore they had not deseruyd his grace
and his love: Neuirtheles they ran to arms and said that they would defend
them fro the hongers / and would never deye for naught / but erst would they
selle their life much dear / when the king and the hongers saw this. they
thought that this people were much strong and hardy / and there as all
dispayred / And saw that he might not overcome them without great loss of his
people in that manner / and left the force of bataylle / and took him to
subtilite and falshed / as people that is full of barate deceyte and trycherye^
The king and the hongers sent message to godechan and to the great men of the
company for to deceive them by fair words of peace / and said to them in this
manner

Over great complaynte and much foul renomme is comen to the king of you fair
syres / which has sent us hither / ffor as he has herd say / ye have not
had to none of your hoostes no faith ne truth. But have taken fro them that
they hadde^ and have beten And slain them / ye have taken their daughters and
wives and do such oultrages to them as it ought not be said The marcheauntes
and other people that ye find by the ways* be not sure^ and goo not quyt fro
you but be robbed and pyled Of which things the king has great clamours
aftir him / Neuirtheles the king knows well / that ye be not all in this
defaulte but there ben among you many good men and wise to whom this folly much
displaysyth / And the oultrage of the malefactors which have so angered the
king and his people / Therefore the king will not put the defaulte of one party
upon all ne it is not right that the true pylgryms should bye the trespaas of
the bad / and doubts to take vengeance on you all / wherefore we counsel
you that ye appese the king in this manner / And we promise you in good faith
that ye shall never have damage / offer and (...) your bodies / your arms and
all your things in his will and in his mercy / without making of any
appoyntement with him for if ye will not so do. ye see well. ye have not the
puysau^ce against him / for ye be in the myddle of his royamme. And may not
escape him. Godechan and the great men of his host to whom this oultrages
much displesyd. and the folyes of the mean people trusted well in the words
that they had brought to them. And hade great hope in the hyenes and mercy of
the kyng^ They called the people / counseyled and prayde them that they would
render their harn^ys / and put them in the mercy of the king / they would not
do it. and said there should never come good to them to put them under so
untrue people. Nevertheless at last they did by the counseyl and will of the
wise men. Their harnoys and all that they had they delyuerd at
commandment of the king. when they supposed thereby to have gotten their life /
They ran to the death / ffor the hongers assaylled them anon in the mydle of
them all armed / And of this point took none head / they began to slay and
smite of heedes without demandyng who was good ne who was evil They slew so
many that they waded in the blood unto the half leg / it was sorrow and pity
to see their bodies of so fair people slain in the streets ways and feeldes /
some happed tescape that went among the other^ and returned in to their contre
/ and told this meschyef and trayson / by which they taught all the pylgryms
that they fond that they should not trust to the people of hongrye /

How / C.C / M. christian men a foot and three.M. a horsbak without capytayn
assembled in this pylgremage / and of their mayntene / capitulo xxviijo.
iN a litil time aftir this great occisyon that I have said to fore assembled
much great people a foot without capytayne Nevertheless there were among them
hye men and good knights But the comune people obeyed them not / ne byleuyd
them of nothing / There was emonge them Thomas de fere. clerembault of
vendueyl / Guillem Carpenter^ And the count herman / These people that were a
foot did many ylles and oultrages by the way / And there arrose among them a
madness and a rage of which they could not keep them fro sleyng of all the
Jews in all the ways and towns by which they passed / They slew
merueyllous great nombre at Coleyne at Magonce / and in other places / In thise
parties as they went was an earl a right noble lord named Emycon / when he
saw this people / he put him self in their company for to goo with them in
this pylgremage / he chastysed not ne blamed the mysruled people / but entysed
them to do evil tornes / They passed by francone and by bauyere so far that
they drew in t^ hongrye and came in to a town naemd meeszebors. well supposed
they to have passed in to hongrye without any gaynsayeng / but when they came
to the brygge / it was deffended them and closed^ There was a for^resse which
was closed on that one side with the river of the dunoe / and on that other
side with the ryuernamed lintans / The remenau^t was enuyronned with a deep
mareys / within the fortress was great plente of people well armed wherefore it
was not light for to pass that town by force / ffor the* king of hongrye had
well understand of the coming of this people / which were without faylle well
/ CC / M / on foot. And on horsbak were nomoo but three thousand / And doubted
much that they when they were entered in to his land. would avenge tho^^^sion
that was done by falsehed and trayson upon the people of godechan^ ffor the
rumoure and speech was much yet of that foul and vylanous fayte through out all the land ^ They that saw that they might not pass in to the land. prayed
them of the fortr^sse that they would suffer them to send m^ssag^rs to the king
of hongrye for to require his grace that they might pass in good ^^as and they
would lodge them there whylest in tho places that were full of pastures to fore

How this people began to destroy the land of the king. by ca^^se he would not
grant to them leave for to pass / cao. xx^xo
a Lytil whyl tarried they that went to the king but returned anon / ffor they
might not speed of such things as they de^manded. The king answered that for
^efte ne for prayer should they enter in to his land / when they of the oost
gre^e and sma^e h^rd this / they were much angry / ffor they had trauaylled
and desp^^^ded much good to come thedyr / And now they had loost their wa^ye /
They concluded among them that ^hey should brenne and destro^ye the contreye of
the king / as much as was on this side the mareys / They set fire on towns
and took the men and de^troyed all the contrey^ whiles the^ did thus / the
people of the fortre^^^ came out and with other people of the kyn^g^s to ^he
nombre of (...) what of knights and other people well armed and passed by
ships er ever the pligrims knew of it any w^^d and they set them f^r to
deffende the pylgryms at a paas that they should not entre^ when the pylgryms
saw this / they ran vygorously upon them in such wise that er they might save
them self they were slain all sauf a few of them that withdrewe them in to
the mareys ^ and ^ydde them in the re^d / when these p^lgryms thus had the
vict^^ye they mounted in much great hardynes / and said that by force they
would take the fortress of hongrye / and without leave they would pass through
the land. Then they began to somonne and recomforte every man to do well /
They took poles and made scaffholdes much great plente / which they set to
the walls / And mounted up couerd with their sheldes and targes and assaylled
it much hardely many pyked with pykoys and mined the walls with great force
that thentre seemed al ready for to entree they that were within were nyghe deed
for despayer. ffor they defended slowly as men affrayed in their hertes. ffor
they supposed anon to be slain / and suddenly came a fere and a dread upon the
hertes of the pylgryms that wened anon to be slain / And never was known
wherefore it was. and anon fyl donn fro the scaffoldes / and tarried not / but
fled suddenly / and none wyste why they fled. The hongers when they saw
this / might with great pain believe it. that this was truth / ffor they saw
no rayson why. Nevertheless when they apperceyuyd they descended down / and
began to follow the chaas. in such wise that them next to fore them. were
almost all taken and slain. In this adventure was fonden none other reason /
sauf that the people was so full of sin / that they had not deseruyd the love
of our lord / ne thonoure of the world / And therefore their sins acowarded
them in such wise that they might not do ne accomplysshe this great work /
which they had nyghe achyeued. The earl Emycon came again in to his contre with
great nombre of people disconfyted / The other barons of ffraunce that I fore
have named went in to lombardye and so in to puylle / There had they knowleche
that so^me of the great barons were passed in to duras and fro thens in to
greece / They went aftir and folowyd them. In this manner were the people of
ffraunce disperpled and of the contrees there by / The way of hongrye was much
more strayte and ner if they might have goon it / And had not be destrowbled by
their folly / But the other that came aftir peyned them much for to goo more
wisely and more in peace

tHe wise man and noble Godefroy Duc of ^^^^yne And the other princes that with

what occasion the other pylgryms / whom they held for felaw^ and brethren ^
have so cruelly be slain and smeton in pieces in your ^^wer / Well they know
and send you word that they have been so slain. ffor they have fonden many of
them that been escaped / Much they meruaylle how ye and your people which ben
christian as ye say / have thus destroyed the good company which for to
enhau^se the faith of Ihesu Crist ben departed out of their contre / in such
wise that the most mortal enemies that they have. had not don werse / They
desire much to know if it were by the defaulte of the pylgryms. ffor if ye
have done it by Justice. or in deffendyng you and your lands / or other wise
that they would enforce and take any thing away if it were so / The duc and his
felaws would take it more lightly / But if it be do without their trespaas or
for hate that ye had to them / and thus murdered them. they that sent us
hither. let you wete by us. that they have left their own cou^treyes for
tauenge the wrongs and the oultrages that have been don to the people of our
lord / And if they find that ye have so do / they be not in will to pass
ferther. till they have to their power avenged the death of the pylgryms of our
lord And herwith godefroy that acounted this to the king made an end of his
words

The king was in his palace where he had great plente of barons of his Royamme
and of other people. then answered and said. Godefroy it plesyth me much that
ye be come in to this country for to speak to me / It is a much good thing for
me for two causes / that one is that ye be of mine acqueyntau^ce and my friend
long sith / And we shall afferme and renew our loves and our acqueyntaunces in
this your comyng^ That other cause is that I know you to be a man wyse^
reasonable and of good will / and am much joyous of this that ye shall here my
excusacion / truth it is that we have the name of the cristiente / it were
and should be much fair to vs^ if we had the works / But they that been passed
tofore with peter theremyte and with godechan have not the works of pylgryms
ne of christian men / ffor we receyuyd peter theremyte and his people in our
lands and in our towns with great debonayrte And departed with them our
vytaylles and other things we gaf to them / But they like as the serpent that
prycketh or styngeth him that keeps him warm in his bosomme / has guerdonned
and rewarded us for our good deeds / for in the end of the royamme of hongrye /
when they ought to thank us and render graces to god and to their friends /
They took by force one of our best castellis / And put to death all that were
therein. and carried the beestys with them / they took all the maidens of the
town like rowters and thieves. The company of godechan came after them / they
abode not to forfaytte til the end of our Royamme / but as soon as they were
entered and passed the yates of hongrye they began to make all thoultrages they
might / They burnt the towns slew the men / enforced the wymmen / and bare
away all things / they did so much that for their trespaces. were well
worthy to have hate of god and of the world / we that be here in the place and
in the dygnyte / by which we ought to keep the people / as long as it shall
please god and our barons that have sworn the feaulte of the Royalme might not
well endure thus to destroy our people and our country. but have put to the hand
by force in us defendyng / The third company came also with folk a foot / we
doubted the noise and debate in such wise / that we would not suffer them enter
in to our land ne come emonge us / Our lord that Iugeth all the words and
knows all thing / wot well that it is thus and that I have lied to you no
word. Now we pray you that ye excuse us oueraal where ye shall here speak of
it / when he had said this be sent the messagers in to their Innes / where
they had much great honor and great feste / The king took counseyl of his
barons and ordained his own messagers which he sent to the duc godefroy and
to the princes that came He had spoken ynowgh to godefroy dasque / and made him
great c^ere / and gaf to him and his felawshippe yeftes / And aftir took leave

all thise were conquered upon the greeks But afterward there was an Emperor
named Basilie recouerd thise londes^ And brought the blacz and the bongres
long before this time / in such wise that the two danemarches were comen again
to his po were / but yet would not the greeks suffer to repair again the towns
/ ne labor the lo^des which should be right good. to the end that none should
enhabyte there^ By cause they hold it for a strength / And that nothing should
be fond therein / Also in espyre which extends fro duras^ unto a mount named
bagula^s / And endures four iourneyes. by that passed the other barons / But
the Duc and his company passed by danemarche la Ma^en / which is named other
wise Mese / They came by a destrayte. which is named the Cloys^^e of saint
Basyle / And sith they descended in to a plain / Where they fond great plente
of vytaylle and of pastures / And came unto A^ine po^ which is a much fair
cite and good / There herd they say and truth it was / that the emperor of
constantynoble had enprisonned huon le main / brother of the king of ffraunce^
and many other barons that came with him. ffor thise noble men were hasty and
came by lombardye in to puylle / ffro thens they passed to duras / And soiourned
for tabyde the other barons / which ought to come in to tho parties / ne they
supposed to have doubted any thing in the land of the greeks that were christian
as they were / But the baylly of duras took all the most great barons. and
sent them in yrons to the emperor of Constantynoble to do his will with them
/ he held them in prison. and abode the coming of the other barons / by cause
if they came with great power he would deliver them for their love / and if they
came not with great might he thought not lightly to let them pass. when the
duc godefroye and the other barons herd tidings of this prisonment / he took
good messagers and sent them with their lettres to the emperor And they prayde
and warned him that he should send to them without delay this hye and noble
man huon le main and all his company / ffor they held him for lords:
brethren and felaws of this pylgremage. And herin he had don more his will
and his force than right / when he had retained one so gentil and hye prynce^

How the duc godefroye constreyned the emperor by force to render and delyuere
his prisonners / capitulo. xxxiiijo.
iN this time was Emperor a greek much falls and full of tricherye and was
named alexes and to his surname Conius / he was much acqueynted and pryue with
that other Emperor Nychofores bothomat in such wise that he made him his
steward / And was the grettest man of the land sauf the emperor He by his
malice purchaced evil and harm against his lord by thassent of great people
that he held about him. and took him and held him in his prison vj year
tofore that our pilgryms came theder / The messagers of the Duc and the other
barons demanded of this Emperor Huon le Main like as they were commanded
and the other prysonners / in like wise / The Emperor answerde shortly that he
would not delyuere them / They returned in to the host and / said to them
thansuer of the emperor when the duc and the other barons herd this they were
much wroth And concluded among them by their counseyl / that they would plainly
make war against him / that did so great oultrage to hold so hye a prince in
prison ne would not answer by mesure ne reason / They habandonned to the
hooste to take in that contre where they were in. All that they could fynde^
And burnt all the towns / Thus abode they in thise parties. and destroyed
all the contre / And did much great dommage and harm and^ great plente of
proyes and other gaynes came in to the host of the barons / The Emperor sense
unto the duc and unto the other barons / that they should do hold their people
in pees. And that he would delyuere huon te main and the other prisonners^ They
agreed and acordid gladly^ And came with all their bataylles renged and in
ordenaunce to fore constantynoble^ as for tassiege the town Anon issued out
huon the mayne^ doene dancelle / Guylla ne charpentier. Clarembault de venduel

other of their delyueraunce / And the duc and the hooste received them with
much great joy / ffor they had much great ang^e and gre^^ despite of that
was don to them

The great despyte that the emperor took that duc godeffroy reffused to goo in
to constatinoble unto him. capo. xxxv
Whiles they spak thus to gydre came the messagers fro the emperor to the duc^
And required them in their lords name that he would enter with a few of his
company in to the town / And come speak with the emperor / The duc had counseyl
herupon and answered / that he would not yet come in to the town when the emperor
herd this. he had thereof much great despite And deffended oueral that there
should no more v^taylle be sold to them ne none other things. The noble men saw
this^ and sent out on fouragyng over all the countrey^ And they brought in
vytaylle great plente in such wise that they had ynowgh pour and rich
The Emperor saw that this contre should be destroyed / and doubted that they
would yet do werse / therefore he commanded to his marcheauntes that they should
goo in to the hooste and selle to them such thing as they neded^ The day of
Cristemasse or of the Natyuite of our Lord approached / Therefore the Duc and
the Barons did do cry in the hooste / that no man should forfaytte ne trespace
in tho four days / The mean while came the messagers of the emperor that spak
to the barons much say that they would pass the brygge and come on the side
of the palace which was named blaquerne^ ffor there might all the hooste
lodge in great howses which were nygh the braas of saint george And all this
said they for tricherye and deceyte Neue^theles our people byleuyd them lightly
/ ffor the winter was much cold and sharp of raynes and snowes. in such wise
that the pauyllons roted and ne might not hold out the water of the rain / the
horses and pour people might not endure it^ hereof took the emperor his occasion
for to send in to the host / and that they should pass toward the town / and
seemed that he had great pity on them / but his entencion was all other wise /
ffor he did this to the end that he should enclose them in a place more strayt.
that they should not run in to the contre. And that he might have the grette^
power to constrayne them therein

Of the descripcion of constantinoble / And of many countre^^ and lands there
about capitulo xxxvjo.
fOr to understood how the barons were enclosed by the desloyaulte of
the emperor / it is to wete how the cite of constantinoble stondeth / the sea
which is in venyse comes nygh unto / xxx mile of constantinoble / ffor thens
departs an arm like a fresshe water. And estendeth it toward the eest in
length / ij / C / xxx / mile / it is not like even / ffor in sum place it
is^ but a mile brood And in another it is well. xxx / of bread or more / after
the places that it renneth in^ And it renneth between these two Ancient cytees
Sexton and Abydon. of which that one is in asye / And that other in europe /
ffor the arm is divided fro these two lands Constantinoble is in europe: That
other part is nycene which is in asye / This braas or arm thus as it is
most broad toward the sea / like a roode where the port is / it is said that
it is moost^ paysible / And easyer than the sea is. nyghe thereto stondeh
constantinoble which is like a tryangle. The first side is by^wene the port
and this arm / There stands a church of saint george / of which that see is
named the braas of saint george / And this endu^^th unto the new palace of
blacquerne after the port / That other pan of the wall dureth fro this
church of saint george unto the port air / The third pan fro that yate unto
the palace of Blacquerne / The town is much well closed toward the champayne
of walls of dyches of towers and of barbicans / At port descends a fressh
water rennyng / which is lytil in the somer / but in winter it becomes much
great for the rain / This water has a brygge on which our men passed over /
which is enclosid between the great see and the braas / behind the yate /
where they lodged for tabyde that coming of other barons The Emperor sent often
his messagers to the duc^ And sent for him to come and speak with hym^ The duc
doubted much his tricherye and would not goo / But to the end that he took it
not for evil / he sent to him three noble men / that is to wit ^ Canon de
montagu / Henry dasque / and bawdwyn de bort. and excused him by them / that
the barons that were with him would not counseylle him to goo and speak with
hym^ till that the other barons were common The Emperor was much / wroth and
deffended again that no vytaylles sold be should to the host. And did yet
werse / ffor he sen^e on a day erly in the morning ships al full of archers
that came suddenly by the braas right there as the duc was lodged they shot
great plente of arowes in such wise that they slew much people that was goon
on the sea syde^ And many they hurted by the doors and wyndowes /

How our people burnt their lodgys and took their harnoys And of an assault
that the greeks made on them / cao. xxxvijo.
When the Duc and the other barons herd this / by com^^ counseyl / they sent
the brother of the duc for to take the brigge / to the end that they of the town
should not sease ne take it / They took / v / honderd men what knights as other
well armed and came first to the brygge and kept it and saw that all the cite
was meued and armed for to come on them Our men were then adcerteyned that
they of the town were their enemies / And set fire in the howses were they
lodged in / and in other by which they doubted and fered well a / vj / thousand
or seven in such wise that some of Emperors own howses were burnt / After
they did do sown their tompet^es / And went them all in ordenaunce after
the Duc toward the brygge^ ffor they doubted much that they of the town would
come theder for to deffende them the paas / but as I have said bawdwyn brother
of the duc had then gotten it upon the greeks whom he had oue^throwen and
chased right far. The host and all the carriage passed over / all in to the
country. And arrested there all in ordenaunce in a fair plain much fyers and
courageous by the church of saint cosme and damyan / which now is named the
palace of buymont and the palace of blacquerne / when it was come nygh the
euentyd there were many slain of them of the town / and of the other but not so
many / The greeks might no longer sufre. but the pylgryms discomfyted them and
chassed them sleyng and he wyng all them that they might arreche in such wise
that they droof them in to the town by force^ Then returned they again as
they that had won the field / And lodged in the plain / The greeks were
much swollen and angry of that they had lost so many men and had been so evil
demened^ And began to ordeyne through the town how they might issue out with
much more affraye and strenger than they had^ But the night came that
destourned their counseyl. This was an evident thing that the emperor had d^n
the barons pass the brygge by tricherye and untruth for to have closed them
as within barryers

How after this our people began to destroy the contre. And ofa message of
buymont unto duc godefroye. And the answer of the duc upon the same^ capitulo
xxxviijo.
As soon as thoost apperceyued on the morn the day / it was cried that every
man on pain of death should arm him / on horsbak and on foot / The Capytayns of
some bataylle were ordained for to lead the people in fourage. The other set
them in ordinance for to keep their lodgys / ffor well they apperceyued
certainly that the emperor pourchassed for them all the evil that he might.
They that went for vytaylle withdrewe them well / lx / mile / They pylled al
about them all the towns that they fond / And brought Corn / Wyn / Beestys.
and other Rychesses / Whereof the land was full that uneath might they
conduyte all / And they were out sex days / And aftir retornned in to the
hooste with all this merueillous gain / whiles as they contained thus^
Messagers came fro Buymont to fore the Duc / And salewed him in their Lords
name / And delyuerd to him lettres which said in this manner / He salewed in
his letrres the duc as he ought to salewe such a man / Aftir they said /
know ye sire that ye have to do with a much untrue man / which alwey set
his heart and purpoos to deceive them that trust in him / Specially he hates
the Latyns to the death. And does his power in all manners. that he can to do
evil to our people. And if ye have not yet apperceyued it / ye shall know al by
time as I say to you / ffor I know well the malice of the greeks / And also
the trycherye of the emperor / Therefore I pray you / that ye withdraw you fro
constantinoble / And return to ward the playnes of andrenoble or of sympole /
and there ye may wyntre you where as is great plente of all goods / And I my
self if it please god as soon as the spring of the year comes shall come and
have to meue. And shall assemble with you / And shall help you / as my lord and
friend. against the untrue prince that entendeth to do evil with all his
power unto cristiente / when the duc had herd these lettres by the cou^seyl of
his barons He sent to him ageyn other lettres that after the salewyng spak
thus / we thank you gretely. And so do the other princes that been with us of
the love and truth that ye have sent us / And know ye certainly that we
have founden on the prince and on the people of greeks / like as ye wene well to
know / we know well that ye say it of wisdom and of truth / But we doub^e
much the arms that we took in our country for to war on the hethen men /
should return and convert against them that bear the name of cristiante as we
our self do / we attend and desire much your coming / Then if god will when
ye shall be comen we shall do take you to our counseyl

How the emperor appesed the duc godefroye and sen^e for him and of the honor
that he did to him. capitulo / xxxix
The Emperor was much anguyssous among his pryue cou^seyl. and thought how he
might appese to him the duc and his people by cause he destroyed his contre / of
which he herd the clamours right great and often / And by cause that he knew
that the messagers of buymo^t were come / and had brought tidings / that he
would hastily come he sent ageyn his messagers to the duc and prayed him that he
would come speak to him / and if he doubted of any thing he would send John his
sone in hostage in to the host / This message plesyd much to the barons when
they herd it / and they sent canon de montagu / and bawdwyn de borgh for to
receive the hostage / they received him and delyuerd to Bawdwyn brother of the
Duc which abode for to Reule and govern the host and to keep the hostage /
The duc and other barons went in to Constantynople to fore the emperor which
had much desired them / The greeks made to them great Joy merueyllously what
someuer they thought. The Emperor kyssed them all. And demanded of euerych his
name / for to honor euerych by him self / as he that well could do it. they
were well beholden of all them of the palace / At last the emperor satte in his
mageste. and the barons about him And said to the duc these words / we have
herd say many times in this land / that thou art of high lygnage / and of
much great power in thy contre and a good knight and true / in such wise
that for the faith of Ihesu criste ^enhaunce. have enterprised to war against
the mescreauntes and hethen people / which grieve the christian people
merueyllously / ffor all these things we praise the and love in our heart /
And will honor the with grettest honor that we may do / ffor thou art
worthy and dygne / It playseth us and thereto acorden our barons / that we
cheese the and auowe for our sone / And we put our Empire in to thyn hand.
that thou keep it as our sone from henssforth in good estate and in terms of
love / when he had seyde this / he did him to be clad with the robe of an
Emperor / And to sytte by him / And then the barons made to him right great
feste and solempnyte aftir the custom of the land in such things / And thus
was the pees affermed between the princes / and also between the people

Of the yeftes that the emperor made to duc godefroye. to the barons and to the
gentilmen of his hoost^capitulo xlo.
Anon when this was don / the tresour of the emperor was opened and was
presented to the duc / and to his felawship / so great yeftes and so great
rychesses that it was merueylle to see / There was great plente of gold of
syluer^ and of precious stones / many clothes of sylk right rich: vayssellys
of diverse facions which were merueyllous of facions and of matere / Our
people meruellyd much of this great richesse / These yeftes cessed not at the
first time / but fro the day of the Epyphanye / unto thas^encion tide /
the emperor gaf to the Duc every weke as much as two mighty men might sustain
/ of pierrye / of pens of gold of copper and of tyn he gaf to him ten muyes.
every muye is four busshellys^ But the duc departed all these things unto
knights and all about where he saw / that it should be well employed When
they had been with the emperor a lytil while / they t^ke leave and came again in to
the host / They sent again Johan his sone whom they had holden in hostage
much honorably / The Emperor did do cry upon pain of death / that noman
should do harm to the pylgryms / but should do selle to them all manner wares
at prys reasonable / The duc in like wise did do cry. that every man as dear
as he louyd his life should do no force ne wrong to them of the contree / Thus
forthon lyuyd they in much peace / when March came the duc knew well / that the
other barons would come / and apperceyued well that the will of the emperor was /
that he would pass with his people the braas of saint george / To the same
acorded the barons and the other of the host / And said to the emperor that he
would pass over / And he anon did do make ready many ships and passed well
all and came in to be^hin^. which is the first party of Asye. They lodged
them about the Cite of Calcedome / Of this cite find we written that in the
time of pope lion and Marcyen the emperor assambled there one of the iiij great
cou^seyllis / where there were.iij^C.xxxvj / prelates for to condemn an
heresye / that a Monk named Entyses had founden^ And that held a patriarch of
Alysaundre named discre^tus / but there they were dampened / This cite is so
nyghe constantynoble that there is but the braas between them both. And there
was the host lodged much easily / ffor who so had to do in the cite of
Constantynoble he might pass twyes or thryes in a day / The cause why
the emperor made the duc to passe^ was for he would not that / the hoostes of the
barons that were to come should not assembhe to gydre so nyghe him / And in like
did be to the other barons that came aftir^ ffor he never would lodge tweyne to
gydre /

How Buymont was made capitayn of a great host. And the names of many nobles
of thoost and of their mayn^ene^ cao. xli
aFtir this manner contened him the emperor and duc godefroy^ But buymont the
sone of Robert guychart prince of Tarente had passed the sea adryane / And was
come unto duras / when all his host was comen he took his way through the
deserts of bougrye / And went soft an dfayr by cause of them that followed
him. In his rowte were many noble men / of whom we shall name to you a part /
that is to wit / Tancre the sone^ of graal the marquys. Rychard the pryncipat
sone of william ffierbrace. The Brother of Robert guychart / Raymont his
brother / Robert the hanse / Herman of caryn / Robert of sourdeual / Robert
fytz cristen^ vmfrey fytz raoul / Rychard sone of therle Ranyol earl of
rousygnol^ and all his brethren. Ogan of chartes^ Anbery of cannac / And
vmfrey of montygneux / All these had made buymout their capytayn / They came in
to the cite of castore and made there the feste of cristemasse and held it
much hyely / But by cause they of the contre would selle to them / nothing
which held them for enemies / therefore by force they must send out on
fouragyng. and brought great proyes and good gaynes / of which they did much
harm to all the country / Aftir they came in to the land of pelagome / which
is much good and fertile and lodged them there / Aftir they herd say that
nygh by was a castle right strong wherein all the popeliquans of the land were
withdrawn for the strenght of the place / And there were none but such
mysbyleued people / Buymont and his people armed them and went theder auon / And
found there much great richesse in the town and great proyes which they put
out a part / And after set fire there in the town / And all them that issued
they slew with the sword. And the remenaunt both men and wymmen they brent
all. The Emperor herd say that Buymont came with great people. And doubted much
/ And had his coming much suspecyonous ffor he had many debates against him and
his of which he had alwey^ the werse^ The souldyours of the emperor and all
they that entermeted of arms soiourned and wyntred in these parties by which
Bumont passed / The Emperor commanded to his conestables of all his people that
they should cooste buymont with as much people as they might get unto the
water named bardare / in such manner that if they might grieve ennoye and
do^mage in any paas to them. that they should come on him strongly^ Thus he had
ordained cautelously behynd them. but to fore as he / was much disloyal and
convert / and could well make semblaunt of other thing than he thought. he
sent unto buymont of his great men / And by them lettres much payssyble and
of fair words / And of bountes much debonayr and deceyualle which were as
folowen

Messagers and letres fro The Emperor to Buymont / and the contenue of the same
as follows. capitulo xlijo.
tHe salewyng to fore was much fair / And aftir said / we know certainly
that thou art an hye prince and^ much noble sone of an noble and valiant man /
ffor this great manner we preyse the / and have the in chierte / And also for
thou have enterprised. with so good heart and so good will in this time the
seruyse of our lord / And the pylgremage which is du^ unto all them that
believe in Ihesu criste. we have ferme will and certainly purpoos to honor
the / And show by deed our grace that we have thought / Therefore we pray and
require the in good faith that thou commaude to thy people that they do none
oultrage to our people. and haste / the to come to us all surely. ffor thou
shall have thereby honor and prouffyt / Our messagers that come to the shall by
our commandment do thyn hooste have reasonable market of vytaylles and of all
other things / The semblaunt of thise words were fair / but there was there
under much venym and of felonnye^ Buymont which was wise and knowing many
things had many times preuyd the desloyalte of the emperor / And received these
words by semblau^ce much aworth and in thank / But be preysed them lytil in
his courage. Nevertheless he thanketh him by mouth / and by lettres that he
daygned to write to him and sende^ considered that he was so small a man against
him and sense him other curtoys words etc^ / Thise messagiers that were thus
comen conduyted the host unto the river of bardre / when the moo^e party of
the host were passed over. and the other ordained them for to pass after^ The
conestables of the soldyours which had awayted and followed them wened to have
founden their point. And launced on this party of thoost which was not yet
passed and were many moo of them than of ours / The noise and the cry arroos
much great. Tancre which much was appert and hardy had tho passed half the
river which was grete^ but when he herd this he returned again as hastly as he
might / and discomfyted / ij.M / of the most noble of them vigorously and
put them to flight. And many he took of them a live / whom he brought to fore
buymont he demanded them in the presence of all / wherefore they had run so
on the host of the christian men / which were also christian and people of
the emperor their lord and friend / They answered that they were servants and
soldyours of^ the emperor and must do his commandment. ffor by him they had
this don here by might all they apperceyue that herd this. that the fair
words that the emperor said were but deceyuaunce and tricherye / but buymont
which was wise and knew that he must pass by thempyre made semblau^t that
he apperceyued not / and made good chere to thise men for to couure his courage
/ And that plesyd not some of his barons /

How Buymont approuched coustantinoble and was sent to come to the emperor. And
how by the prayer of duc Godefroye he went toward him / capitulo xliijo.
bVymont and his host went so far by the countrees that they approached
Constantynoble. when the emperor knew that he sent again great mesagers to him
/ and prayde him entierly that he would leave his host and come speak with him
with a pryue meyne / Buymont wist not what to do. ffor he was in the danger
of him so great a man. whom he doubted to anger / And on that other part he
knew his falsenesse and deceyuaunce And had well apperceyued that he louyd him
not / And therefore he fered to goo to him / whiles he was thus entredeux / The
Duc Godefroye came to him the thursdaye before Esterdaye. ffor the emperor had so
much prayed the Duc / by cause he doubted that he would not gladly come to him /
that the Duc went to him for to make him come to the emperor / when the duc and
Buymont met / they made much great Joy to gydre and spak to gydre of many
things. After entered the duc for to pray him to come to his fader the emperor
/ Buymont was loath tobeye his prayer and request / But with great pain the duc
vaynquysshyd him by prayer / And made him to goo^ The Emperor received him with
great honor and joy and kyssyd him / And aftir spak so much to him and to
the duc that Buymont by the counseyl of the duc made to the emperor hommage with
his hondes and swar to him feaulte as to his lord / Then should ye have seen
come out of the tresour of the emperor many great rychesses. gold / silver /
vessel / precious stones / and clothes of sylk so much that uneath might be
preysed / whiles that Buymont abode in the palace. Tancre his neuew sone of his
suster that was right wise and of great her te retched not for to see
The Emperor ne to speak to him / But made all the host to pass over the braas
saint george and to lodge in bethine nygh to calcedome / where thooste of the
other barons had been agood while / when the emperor knew that tan^^^ had
eschewed him. he was much wroth^ but he made no semblaunt thereof. as he that
well could couure his courage / he made much great feste to the barons that
were with hym^ and every day he gaf to them great yeftes and new things /
Aftir they departed by his leave / And passed the braas with the other / There
soiourned they and abode the coming of the other barons^ There was brought to
them great plente of vytaylles / and of other things fro the cite of
constantynoble and fro the country aboute^

of many things to gydr^^ And af^e^ like as other barons had don he did
hommage and made (...) of feaulte / The Emperor gaf to him great yeftes / and to

when the Earl and all the barons herd thise tidings by these lettres. they
were glad and joyous / ffor they had long suffered great diseases / They took
their way by forestes and by montaynes^ and passed the land of Epyre. Aftir
they came in to pelagonne where they fond much great plente of all goods /
The valiant bishop of puy lodged him on a day fer fro the host in a fair

therefore he defended him fro the other. that they slew him not / In the mean

them that had the charge of his men of Arms / And commanded them secretly in
counseyl^ that they should auyse their time and point and smite in to the hooste
of The Crle / And do to them all the harm they might And slay great plente
of them / This did The Emperor comaunde them the more surely / by cause that he
wyste well that they that were on that othersyde might not help them. And by
cause they were his men they would not s^ne grieve them / And had commanded that
all the ships to bear over vytaylle. should come hastily ageyn in to the
Cyte^ So that they on that other side should not come over a gayn / ffor ever he
had suspection thassemble of our people / And therefore he made them to pass
over each after other as they came / The great chere that he made to them / And
the great yeftes that he gaf came more by barate and of dread than of love or of
largess / But our people and specially the ffrenssmen might not believe that

trauaylle that they / had suffered in the night / And of the trayson of the
greeks / and their hertes began to cole / and to faylle of the purpoose of
their way and pylgremage. And no^ only the small and comune peple^ but many of
the great and noble men had forgoten their vows and their honors and would
have returned home unto their country. But the noble bishop of Puy / and the
Biss^op of Orange were emonge them and many good wise relygyous men and clerkys
that preached to them the words of our lord and recomforted them much well /
And shewde them that if they returned they should lose thonour of this world /
And also of that other^ Thus with great pain they retained them. when the earl
which was in Constantynople herd of the trayson that was don to him in his
host. he was as a man out of his wit. and anon sent his men to the emperor /
And sent him word that he had betrayde him. ffor whiles he retained him and
made him good chere. he had do slay his people by trayson / And sent word
hereof to the barons that were on that other side. prayeng them as his brethren
that they would come to him to aue^ge it^ well may ye know that if therle had
power sufficient. he would not have departed till he had auengyd hym^ And that it
should have been dear bought / ffor he was a man of great courage. And forgate
not lightly shame don to him / The Emperor saw that this thing was goon over
far in such wise that he repented him / that he had so commanded in his
anger and hastynes and hasted him much for to set counseyl in this work /

by cause he would send them for to appese therle of Toulouse / They came which
were much angry of this that was don / They went to therle in the name of
the emperor / But they said to him more on their own behalue than of
themperours / They shewde him well that it was not time ne place for tauenge his
shames that had been don to him in the seruyse of our lord ffor it should be
empesshement unto the great work that they had enterprised for to save their
sowles / And on that other side if they would so do they had not the power ne
puyssaunce. therefore it were better to hyde their thoughts / than to discouere
their hertes to their damage and shame / the Earl thus angry was no fool / but
souffred that his wit vaynquysshe his anger / And said that he would submette
to these two noble men that spak to him and believe them / They came to
the emperor privily. and showed to him all the foul deed and work that was
commysed / The Emperor understood the great ire that they had in their hertes /
and sent for therle to come to him in to his palace / and excused him to fore
all pryue and apperte and estrangers. that he had not commanded this fayte to
be done / but it displesyd him much / And yet he being without culpe and blame
thereof. he was ready to restore to the Duc all the damages that were don to
his hooste after his power^ Thus every day by day / and more and more might well
be perceived the great hate that the greeks had to the latyns / And of the
desloyal felonnye that the emperor had in his heart / against our pephe / but it
must be suffered / ffor it might not then be amended

the Earl make to him remonstrance / acordyng to the barons which had spoken in

pylgrenagr was a much hye thing ^ and that he much desired the pardon / And
above all other thing the company of so hye noble men plesyd him much And
about him and his empire he said he had much cruel people and much untrue as the

many times and was merueyllously displesyd with him / And thought how he might
chenysshe to be at his ^ase / he took in his hand a arbaleste good and mighty /
and held it bent til the turk came again and abandouned him / The duc took his
sygh^ and mark and shot at him and smote him right through the belly that he
fyl down to the ground fro the wall / The cry and the showtyng began great in
the hooste and the joy / The duc had great honor and many good prayers
therfore^ the other sarasyns that were on that other part of this deffence
were much abashed and ferd that they deffended them the more cowardly. The
other that were in the other parties of the town cast fro the tours stones
upon our people that were at assault and hurt many with castyng. shotyng and
throwyng upon our engyns pytche / Oil and greece all boyllyng / And threw
also brondes and other things brennyng much thycke in such wyse^ that sum
they brente^ They that assaylled on the party of therle of toulouse at the
tour that I said to you to fore. labored sore for to mine the wall / But one
thing destroubled them sore^ what someuer they brak on the day / they within
made it again in the night / in such wise that they were in will to leave it /
And wrought more slowilythan they did byforce^ wherefore a much valiant knight
of the hooste of the Normans came right theder and admonested the assaylles for
to goo forth he passed the dyche tofore with his helm laced / the shield upon
his heed and brake vygorously the wall where as the turks had made again /
But there was none that followed him. And they of the wallys threw so great
stones on him and so thycke^ that they slew him in the presence of the other
that were by / And after with hooks and crochettes they drew the body up to
them on the wall / And there disarmed him / and threw the body to our peple^
Then our men that were there took the body^ and buried it worshipfully / he
was much bewaylled in thoost of christian men

How after many assaults our men being in Counseyl. A^^mbard came to them
which offered to make an engyne that should destroy the town. capitulo / lxjo
Then saw the Barons that they lost much people with thassault / And did
but litil harm with their engyns unto the town and their enemies / Assembled
for to make counseyl how they might do / There came a man to them a lombard
which had seen the great hurt and loss of our people / and said to the barons
that he was a good master to make engyns if he might have stuff and matters
thereto propice and necessary / which with gods help should in short time
overthrow the tour where to. they had don so much pain / and would make large
way for to enter in to the town who so would / They that herd him promised
him that he should have all that should be nedeful / And yet a good reward and
rich for his labor / This master took werkmen and made them to work as he
commanded that in short time he had made his engyn which was merueillously
strong and great / And joined it to the wall all full of men of arms and
footmen / they that were on the walls upon the tour threw with great might
great stones and fire brennyng much thycke / but thengyne was so strong and
rude. that the strokes did it no harm / ne the fire might not fastne on it
when they of the town apperceyued that they could not noye this engyn^ they
were sore a ferde and discouraged merueyllously and all in despayre^ Our men
traueylled to their power to take out the great stones at foot of the wall
of the toure / And vndersetted it with strong stanchons and great / when they
had so much mined that them seemed that it was ynowgh^ They took their
habyllemens and set them far fro the wall / and then put fire on all
sides under the toure and wythdrewe them to their habyllemens and to thengynes
all in saufte which were a great way of. About mydnyght the fire had so
burnt and wrought that this tour fylle down to therthe with so great a noise
and tempeste that it seemed that all therthe trembled / And there was none but
he had great horror and feer in his heart / Our people made hastily do sown
the trumpettes and cry to arms for to come dilygently to thassault.

How after that this engyn had so well wrought / The wy^ of solomon with two of
her childeren went out of the town and were taken by our men / capo. lxijo.
tHe wife of Solomon that long had be in mes^ase of dread / had so great feere

night / But our^ people that were in the ships for to keep the water fro their
en^^myes came against her and took the lady with her two sons that she had with
her then in her companye^ They presented them in the morning to fore the
barons^ They made them to be kept right surely with the other prisonners that
they had / The Turks in the town were then in great meschief as well for
then^^e that was so great and broad / as for their lady that they had lost
then they axed trewes for to speak to the barons to give over the town and
them self in to their hands. Tacius the greek of whom I have spoken to fore
which was much double and malycious spak to the noble men that had the
governance of the town in counseyl. And showed to them that these pylgryms were
straun^gers of far countrees and evil and cruel men ^ And should do to them
all the harm they myght^ And destroy the people and the land: if they yielded
the cite to them. But and if they would aduowe and take the emperor to their lord
/ And yield them to him their lives sauf and their goods in to his hand* he
should keep them well and saufly / and should do to them great good ^ ffor ^e
was their neighbor / So much said he and did. that they of the town took
their counseyl and came to the barons and said to them that they would put in the
hands of the emperor their lives sauf / their bodies the cite and their gods /
This displesyd not much to the barons / ffor their entencion was for to pass
forther / and hoped that the emperor would depart the gayn / proye and goods
of the town generally in thoost^ nevertheless to fore that they would grant
them this thing / they said that they should deliver entierly and do come in
to the host all the prisonners of pieter theremyte that were in the castle of
counthot / And in like wise all the other that they had taken in the siege.
and them to fore that Solomon held. And this don they acorded that they should
yield them to the emperor / Then the barons princes and knights and also the
common people sent by one^ acorde messagers to the emperor for to sygnefye him
how they of the cite had yielded them to him / Therefore they sent to him / that
he should send of his hye and noble men with great nombre of people for to
resseyue the town And the persons of whom they had many / ffor they all
acorded that the honor should be his^ And that the town should come in his
demayne^ And the prisonners at his will / They that had enterprised their vow
for taccomplysshe. had purposed for to depart fro this place and to goo forth
unto the land of surye

How the emperor sent great barons for to receive the said town after that our
people had acerteyned him that they would yield it / Capitulo / lxiij
Great joy had the emperor of these tidings / he tarried not / but sent of his
most prive men as well barons as knights with great quantite of men of arms

nedeful and did repair the walls and all that was broken of the torettes
All that ever they found in the town of Armures of Rychesses and of vytaylles
they seized for the emperor / And sent the prisonners in to Constantinoble /
The Emperor sent to euerych of the barons special lettres. presented to them
great yeftes / And thanketh them much of thonour / that they had don to him /
And of this that they so well kept their promise / ffor that town had don
great gryef and anoyaunce to thempyre / The mean people that much had trauaylled
in the siege and had helped with great courage / compleyned sore / ffor they
had hoped that all the hauoyr and goods of the town should have been departed
emonge them / But themperours men bare it all away^ And they that trauaylled
for it were not rewardid / the word that was much great came unto the barons /
and they said that they had great wrong / ffor the couenau^tes made between
the emperor and them were such that if they gate in their way any cytees that
had been to fore themperours. they should deyluere the cite and the land to
the emperor / but the proyes and gain should be d^parted in thoost. Against these
couenau^tes did themperour^ but it was not time then ne place to make
argument ne debate against the Greeks. therefore the noble men made the common
people to tarye^ to the end that they should not ^npesshe this pylgremage / thus
was suffered that the wife of soliman and his ij sons and great ple^te of
prisoners were led in saefte unto the emperor / which made much great feste to
the lady and her childeren and as long as they were in the town he held them
much honorably / after in short time he sent them again to solomon all ^uyte
delyuerd without demandyng of any raunson. this did he to the end to have the
love and grace of the turks / in such wise that there was between them a
counseyl and acorde to grieve our people / and also for another rayson / that is
to wete if they were in such point of another cite or place that the cristie^s
co^streyned so by force that they should not be aferd to yield them freely in the
hand of the emperor / thus was taken the cite of nycene the year of

great damage which were but few. They that had their sheldes and targes they
kept them some what But they that were without armor must flee / or else they

certain covenant. capo. lxxo.
tAncre which was a wise a man and of great courage rode through the land
sekyng adventure in such wise that he fond in his way a cite called Tarse.
This land of Scylyce is a country of theryent toward the son gooyng down. In
this land ben two great cytees^ which ben Archebisshoprichs that one named
Tarse of which I said to fore / Therein was born saint poul thappostle / That
other was named anauazie / And each of thise two cytees have other cytees under
them / Tarse founded one of the childeren of Noe Ionen which was sone of
Iaphet / the sone of Noe^ Neuerthles sou^ns says that perseus founded it / but
it may be well that one founded it / And that other repaired and amended it /
Tancre assieged this cite and constreyned them within what by menaces and fair
words / that they yielded it to him in a manner / They set this banere upon
the highest toure of the toun^ And he swar and affermed to keep them from damage
and hurt ne non should be put out of his hows. ne lose any thing that
apperteyned to them unto the coming of the great hoost^ And then should they
yield the town unto the great princes of thoost without any debate / Thus was
it acorded between him and them of the town. In this town were christian men
hermyns and greeks / And in all the land about^ But the turk held all the
fortresses that meddled with arms / And had the seygnorye upon this people / And
would not suffer them of nothing sauf to occupye and labor therthe and for to
marchaunte to bye and selle

the cytees unto the see^ They saw tarse nygh them and the pauyllons And they
supposed that they had be turks / that had assieged the cite / They descended
down for to know what people they were / And also for tenquere the being of the
country about / They that were with tancre in thauaunt guard saw these men of
arms approuche And let their lord have knowleche / Tancre wend certainly
that they had be turks that came for to socoure them of the toun^ and made each
man to arm him dylygently / and set them in ordenaunce^ And after issued
out against them / The baners displayed But when they approuched that one to
the other / And knew each other by the arms / they opened their helmes and
embraced each other and made much great joy. And after came to the cite. And
then bawdwyn was by tancre right well and honorably lodged^ ffor tancre had

to have the worship of this town / It is truth that unto this day there /
bawdwyn and Tancre had been like two brethren in much pryue acquaintance and
true love / But bawdwyn by envy of his heart and by evil words that some of

was much wise attemperat and reasonable man understood thise wrodes^ And did
much pain for tapesse him And came in person to bawdwyn. and shewde him how
to fore that he was comen / ne that noman knew of his coming were these
couenauntes made between him and them of the town / And his baner set upon
the toure^ And herin he understood not that he might have any shame ne
dishonor. Baudwyn was not content of thise words and he found sum that
attysed him in his folly / he spak great words ylle and iniuryouses to tancre
/ in such wise / that with lytil more they would have don armed their men for
to have destroyed each other. then^e sent bawdwyn for them of the town / And
when they came he menaced them strongly and said that they should throw down
the baner of Tancre to therthe / And set up his on the tour: And if they did
not they should well know that he would destroy them and all that they had
without the town / and take the town and cast it to therthe maulgre all that
tancre might do / They of the cite saw that tancre might not waraunte ne
deffende them against bawdwyn made with him such couenauntes as they had made
to fore with tancre / And set his baner where as he commanded / Tancre saw
the force that was don to him and was gretely displesyd and had great ire in
his heart / But he couerd his thought wisely And would not suffer the people that
were comen in this pylgremage for to make war against thenemyes of the faith
of Ihesu Crist^ should slay each other for thoccasion of him. he departed fro
this place / ffor he doubted that sum noise or meddle might sourde hereof. And
came to a cite nygh by named adane / There might he not enter / ffor a noble man
of burgoyn named gelphes was parted fro thoost with a great route of men of
arms as the other did for to seek auentures. and he had taken this cite by
force / And had cast out the turks / And held it entierly. Tancre herd that
sum of our people held it^ and sent good messagers to gelphes And prayed him
to opene the yates and suffer his men that they might goo in to the town for to
bye to them such as they neded / This Gelphes did it debonayrly / And him
self gaf to them largely for naught / ffor he had found the town full of gold
and silver of Robes of beestes / of whete / of wine / of oil / and of all
good that a man had need of /

How a lytil after tancre came to the cite of anamystre which the turks held
it and took it by assault / capo. lxxiijo.
tAncre on the morn took leave of his hooste^ And took his way with his people /
And rode so fer that he came to a Cite named anamystre / This was one of the
best cytees of that land / It was fair / and much delytable. Tancre came
theder and knew certeynly that the turks held it / he assieged it al about.
And fro the time that he came he assaylled the town. thus he did the first the
second and the third day / so many assaults he made to them and hurted them
of the town that they were strongly greuyd and abasshed^ they without took the
town and entered under the walls And thus was the town taken by force / And
all them that he fond therein of hethen people he put to death without mercy^
The town was full of rychesses and all manner of vytaylles were great plente^
Tancre departed all the gayn and the goods of the town to his men as he that
well knew how that he should do / and to each man after that he was / in such
wise that all his men were rich They refresshed them much well and their
beestes of the mesease that they had suffered in their waye^ They soiourned

bAudwyn saw / that Tancre was departed fro tarse^ And sent for them of the
town and said to them that they should let them enter in to the toun^ ffor him
thought shame to lie long and abide there idle without doing any thing till the
coming of the great host / They saw and aduysed well that they had not power
enough to resist them. and thought if they let them not enter with their
agreement / that they would enter against their will and without force then
they opened their gates and would that bawdwyn should have two toures where he
should lodge and other of thoste in the howses in the town all peasibly / the
turks that had the seygnorye of the town held yet the other towers in their
puissaunce / they had in much great doubt and suspection bawdwyn and his men
that were lodged in the town / And they thought that they should have no socours
/ And above this they had much great dread of the great host that shortly
should arryue there / and sought emonge them the moyens and manner / How they
might issue out of the town and led with them their wives and childeren with
their pryncipal bageus and Iewellys / It happed that this same night three
honderd men before that were departed fro Buymont for to follow tancre arrived
all to fore this Cite of Tarse where they thought to find him / when bawdwyn
knew what people they were / and that they went in thayde of tancre / be would
not suffer them to enter in to the town They were weary and trauaylled and prayed
him much swetly and cried him mercy many times that for the love of god he
would do so much that they might this night be lodged in the town / ffor they
would nothing but good^ hereof the fotemen of this company prayed him in like
wise / But he would in nowyse here them / Nevertheless by cause they without had
mesease / the mean people in the town aualed down with cords breed enough and
wyn in barellys and other vytaylles^ with which they might well pass this
night / when our people were a sleep in the toun^ And they without began their
first sleep it happed that the turks that were within the toures / opened the
yates of which they had the keys secretly without noise and led out their
wives their childeren and all their things And all the hethen men of the
town thought they were not sure with their ghestes and issued out of all the
town when their wives and childeren were withdrawn a lytil fro the town / they
would leave tokenes cruel and ylle of their departing / they came unto the three
honderd pylgrims that lay without gate and slepte strongly as they that
doubted of nothing / And put them all to death and slew them / if any of them
escaped he was happy

How the people of bawdwyn knew the departing of the turks and of the
slaughter of the christian men^ capo. lxxvo.
oN the morn erly when our men awoke in the town they saw the toures where
the turks had be lodged open and the howses void / They knew well that they
were fled. They serched the walls and yates for to inquire how they were
goon. they went so far that they fond this great occis^on and slaughter at
the gate. Then began a sorrow and a much great cry in the town / All men
put the blame and culpe on Bawdwyn and his knygtes. ffor they would avenge the
death of their brethren whom the sarasyns had so shamely and vylaynously slain.
By cause that the knights of bawdwyn and also he him self would not suffer them
to come in to the toun^ And in deed the men of foot said this was don by great
oultrage and great falshede^ And if they had not lightly withdrawn them in to
the toures / they had smyten them all to death / The knights held them all
stylle till that the footmen were cooled / and after sent messagers which
spak to them and require them to forbere so long / till that Bawdwyn had spoken
to them / they were content to here Bawdwyn speak. Bawdwyn excused him to fore
a^e / and swar and affermed. that for none other thing thentre was deffended
them. but for that he had sworn to them of the town / that by him should none
enter till the great hooste came / By these words and by cause other entermeted
to make the peace and spoken debonayrly to the mean people / was bawdwyn acorded
to the foot man and his knights also. In this town they soiourned and abode a
certain while / until a morning / they saw in the sea nygh them a ship
about in mile fro them / They issued out of the town and descended to the sea
/ they that were in the ship approached to them in such wise that they spak to
gydre / they of the ship said that they were christian men. they demanded of
what contre. and they answered of fflaundres / of holande / and of ffryselande /
And troth it was they had be escumours of the sea and robbers the space of

Iherusalem / they desired them to come a land / And they came and made to gydre
great joy / they had a master over them named guynemer. And was born of
boloyne upon the sea in the land of Earl Eustace fader of the said duc
Godeffroy / when ^e herd that Bawdwyn the sone of his lord was there^ ^e left
his ship And said he would goo with him to Iherusalem / be was much rich of
this evil gain. And had many men with him that be ladde in his ship / then
Bawdwyn left / v^ C men of arms for to keep the town well in point. And after
he took his way for to seek sum auentures as he did to fore / ^e held the
right way al he came to the cite of anamyster^ which tancre had gotten by force
of arms upon the turks as I have said you to fore / Bawdwyn thought well that
he would not let him enter in to the cite* And therefore he lodged him in the
gardyns about / Tancre know that bawdwyn which loved him not was so nygh him
/ And ^e had not forgoten the wrong and the oultrage that bawdwyn had don to
him. Then he did do arm his men^ and said that then was time for to
venge him / ffor he was nygh ^is retrayt^ and bawdwyn was for fro his. They
sent Archiers to fore in great nombre for to hurt and slay their horses
which they had sent in to the pastures. Tancre had with him five honderd men
of arms in good point and well horsed. And smote in sodanly in to the people of
bawdwyn which were not aduysed of them / they slew many and moo they hurted /
the men of bawdwyn ran hastily to arm them and came and fought with them that
ran by the tents / ther^ began a bataylle between them much great and fires /
but it ^ndured not ^^nge / ffor tancre had not so great plente of people that
might endure against the m^n of bawdwyn^ therefore they would withdraw them in to
their town / but their enemies enchassed them strongly so much that they must
flee / there was a brygge over a water between the hooste and the cite / the
people of tancre entered so thyck that many were lost and slain upon the brygge
and drowned in the water / when they were put in to the town again they were
much angry in their heart / and would take more people and return again. but
the night came that destroubbed it / In this scarmuche was taken Rychard le
pryncipat cosyn germayn of tancre and robert danse both two were noble men^ by
their counseyl and atysement tancre had run upon Bawdwyn^ Of that other side
was taken a much noble man named Gylbert de Mountcler^ they were much angry
on that one side and on that other for them that they had lost. ffor they
doubted that they had been slain or drowned / when it came on the morn and their
hertes a lytil aswaged / they sent messagers each to other / And knew
certainly that these men that were taken lived of whom they dredde that had been
deed^ and good men went byt wene / And meddled for to speak of pees in such
wise that they came again to entier concordaunce and parfyght love by the /
grace of the holy ghoost that adressyd their hertes / They amended their
trespaas each to other / And kyssed to gydre as friends in good faith /

should goo no ferther forth / But returned in to thoos^ of the barons / By cause
he herd say how the duc his brother had be hurt peryllously / And would see
and know of his estate and how he ferde / their counseyl was that tancre should
goo forth. Bawdwyn left with him guy neuers / And them that were in his
company comen fro the ship / They passed all syly^e and beat down all the
forestes of the hethen men that they might find. they burnt the towns and
slew their enemyes^ And after came unto a Cite called Alexandrye the less that
they took by force. and conquered all the c^ntre about^ The hermyns and turks
that dwelled in the montaynes of this contre herd tidings that Tancre and his
men were so valiant and so mighty that nothing might hold ayens^ them / And
sore dredde that like as he conquered the playne^ he would come upon them in the
montaynes / And destroy the land entierly and the peple^ ffor tappease his
courage they sent ta him good and certain messagers^ which brought to him
great yeftes. as gold / silver / precious stones / clothes of sylk / horses /

his honor and prouffyt that he would come unto their cite which was named
rages / as is founden in the bible / Thither sent thobye his sone young Thobye

ce^aire / they held yet fermly this law that time / but the turks that were

tributes every year in so much / when time came for to gadre their fruytes^ of
their vynes and other / they raunsouned them and must pay at their will / or
else they would destroy all / Nevertheless in the town durst noman dwell but
he byleuyd in Ihesu criste^ ffor this only town was holden hool and entierly in
the fayth^ the hethen people had conquered the other towns / and therefore they
grieved much the christian people of this town / ne would not suffer them issue out
of the town for to do their needs. ffor on all sides of them was the
puyssaunce of the turks / In this town had the seygnorye a greek that was

they brought all with them And after turned in to their country / On the
third day Bawdwyn issued out and took his way and came to Rages / The duc of
the town that was a greek as I have said to fore came against him. And all the

How the duc that was at rages varyed for to hold this that he had promised to
Bawdwyn / capitulo lxxixo.
Great suspection had the duc in his heart when he saw this Joy that all
made to Bawdwyn^ then by envy he began to find occasions by which he might
/ part fro the couenau^tes such as he had sent which were such / Bawdwyn
should have half the Rentes of all the Cite and of all thexploytes / as long
as the duc lived / After his death which was old he should have all the
seygnorye entierly and hool^ Now the duc would not hold this / But said that
if bawdwyn would deffende the cite fro the strength of the turks and fro their
/ gryeues that they made in the country he would give to him and his men
reasonable souldye and good wages / when Bawdwyn herd this that he was come
theder for to be a souldyour / he had much great desdayne. and said that he
would not abide there so / but would ordeyn^ for him and his men for to return /
the Cytezeyns of the town saw that this thing went not well / And came to the
duc / and shewde him that great evil and peril should follow if he let this
noble man depart / ffor by thayde of him they and all their things should be
kept in peace and deffended / and they should be in great franchys^ The duc saw
well by these words that he should do folly / if he set him against them of the
town / therefore he couerd his heart for that time / not withstondyng he
considered many things and thought / But said that he would acorde thereto /
and made semblaunt that he did it with good will in the presence of all them
of the town. and auowed bawdwyn to his sone / and granted him the half of all
that he had and should have his life during / And after his decees to have all
as his heyr / Great joy had they in the cite when this was made / And had
most ferme hope for to recounte the franchyse of the trubutes that the turks
had charged them / with. ffro that day forth they began to remember in their

childeren so foul as they had been in seruage. he made them to bear donge and
fylthe and d^s foul works / hereof they of rages were much greuyd. They came
to fore bawdwyn. and kneled to him at his feet and prayed him with joined hands
right humbly weeping great teres / that he would deliver them fro this turk
foresaid in such wise that they might recouure their childeren / whom he held
so shamefully Bawdwyn would feign do their request^ after their desire at this
their first request / And to get their love and thank he did do arm him
and all them that he might have / And issued with them out of the town / And
came to fore famosete / And assaylled the town much vygorously / But they
within deffended them as men well garnysshed and in a strong place / when
Bawdwyn had been there I wot not how many days and saw (...) could not

for a puyssaunt man which had many fortresses by them in the montaynes named
constantyn and acorded all to gydre for to slay their duc and would make
bawdwyn duc and lord upon them ffor they much hated this old man that without
fayll had grieved them long time in many manners / for he took fro them gold and
sylu^ and all that plesyd him in the toun^ and there was none so hardy that
durs^ withsta^de him ne displese him ffor if they did ano^ by the turks with

where as he lay. And began strongly tassayle it and enuyronned round about /
The duc saw that the people was so sore meuyd and angry on him / And called
bawdwyn and prayed him to take of his tresour as much as he would and repease
the people / Bawdwyn came among them and trauaylled much by prayers and menaces
for to have supposed to have repeased them / but he might do nothing ffor
always there came moo and more in such wise that the company encreced / Bawdwyn
departed thens fro them and spak to the Duc and said that he should take to him
such counseyl / that he might eschew the furye of the people / ffor he might
not remedy it^ then the duc as a man despayred bond a cord to a wyndowe
and descended down thereby / But when they apperceyued he was through smeton with
arowes er he might come to therthe^ Then they took him al deed / And drew
him through the town / And after smote of his heed / And could not do ynowgh to
satisfy their crueltees. On the morn they took bawdwyn by force against his
will in deffendyng him self / and lift him up as their king and lord / They
made to him oath of feaulte / And after delyuerd to him the great fortress of

the greeks had assembled by long time / Thus was the cite of Rages delyuerd
without contradiction to bawdwyn / Banduc that was lord of ffamosete / saw

brygge upon this water was much well garnysshed of their enemyes^ to the end

came in to the host which alwey meuyd. and was then not fer fro the brygge.
they auaunced their paas and sowned trompes and busynes / and smote on them

no longer there for fere of the great people that they saw come with the great
host / ffor they thought they should not be there sure. The other also
descended / And were put all to flight / in such wise that our men took the
bridge / the other knights of our people that might not come to the baryers
for the preee whilis the scarmuche was. were much anguysshous and descended
doun^ where as there was a place to pass which they of the contre knew not
of. And passed over and discomfyted the seven honderd sarasyns that kept the

Of the situacion of Anthyoche^ capitulo lxxxvjo
tHis cite of whom I have spoken is anthyoche / And stondeth in the land of
this Surye / And is part of the land of the great surye. It stondeth in a
much fair place and delytable / Now I shall recounte to you how it stondeth /
It is a much great town / And about much good land for to bear habondannce
of whete of corn of fair fontaynes and small rennyng waters / and it is among
the montaynes toward the ^est which contre dureth well ill mile of le^gthe and
well vj mile of bread / above there is a lake or mere assembled of sprynges and
wellys that re^ne therein / which is full of fysshe / Of this lake yssueth a
rennyng water which comes nygh the cite. And renneth in to the river that
renneth by the town / the montaynes closed the two sides of the toun^
Nevertheless there ben under them fressh waters and erable land. The mount
which is toward the south is named Oronte / like as I said you of the ryuer^
ffor saint Gregoire says that antyoche is set between oronte the river and
oro^te the mo^tayne / one party of this mo^tayne that goth toward the sea is
much hye insuch wise that it has a name by him self. Sum people wene that
this hylle be pernasus a montayne of which scripture speaks much / by cause
of a fontayne that is at the foot of the same hylle which is named
leschielle buymand / But without fault this is not the mount of which the
auctors speak: ffor this montayne pernasus stondeth in the land named
Thessaylle / That other montayne which is toward the south is named the black
montayne fulle also of sprynges and wellys / of wodes and of pastures / There
were wo^te aunciently thermytes for to dwell / through this valeye renneth the
River that I spak of to fore / And renneth to ward the sea / In the montayne
toward the south begins the walls of Antyoche and come unto the Ryner / hit
is a great espace within the closure^ there ben enclosed within the walls two
montaynes / upon the highest stondeth a fortress so strong that it is not
prenable. but by famyne^ Between these two montaynes which ben much hye is a
valeye right depe^ but it is strayt / in that renneth a litil water right fast
and swyfte and entered in to the town and does much good to the town / In the
Cite ben many fontaynes / but the best is the fontayne which is named the
fonteyn of saint poul. And is nyghe to the eest gate / there is another fontayne
without the town which by craft and conduytes is brought in to the town right
subtylly All the walls of the town / that is to wete they that been on the
montaynes and they that been hangyng / And also they that been in the plain ben
merueyllous thycke^ ffor they ben of over strong work / There ben toures much
hye and well defensable that is toward the son going down / The river renneth
so nygh the town / that the brygge on which men pass joins to the walls
and to the gate of the cite / The length of the town is well two or three mile /
hit is nyghe unto the sea / xij mile of^

Who that was then lord of antyoche / And in what manner he was comen unto
this seygnorye / capo. lxxxvijo.
oF this cite of Anthyoche was lord a turk named Ancean of the mesque / there
had been a puyssaunt so wdan of perse / of whom we have spoken to fore named
belphet which had conquered all these londes^ And after when he would return
again in to his country / he departed entierly his conquest to his neueus and
to sum of his meyne / by cause that he would that they that were his true men
and friends should hold peace each in his party / and should be as defendours
and the closyng of the land / he gaf to his neuew solomon his neuew nycque or
nycene with all their appertenauntes as ye have herd to fore / to another
neuew named du^ar he gaf the Cite of damask / And all the country about / and
would that each of them should bear the name of soudan / and like dygnyte /
Solomon by cause be marched on the greeks had every day debate against
the emperor of Constantynoble / Ducar was against them of Egypt / And often made
war each to other. ffor they loved not to gydre / To the end then that these
two Solomon and ducar might the better mayntene their warre^ he would that they
were puyssaunt and hye men as soudans^ To one his servant named assougur which
was fader of sangum^ And grant fader of Noradyn of whom ye shall here^ here
after / he gaf the remo^med cite called halappe / To this Ancean of whom I spak
to fore he gaf this hye and noble cite antyoche and lytil land about / ffor the
Calyphe of Egypt held all the conntre unto the bounds of Surye^ this ancean
when he herd that the great host of christian men came. he sent messagers and
lettre^ to the barons of tho^yent and him self spak to them by mouth
expressedly and required the caliphe of bandras. and the soudan of perse which
was more mighty than any other / that they would socoure his land and him.
They believed all this lightly / ffor Solomon was comen to them / that had well
assayed what our men could do / therefore he also required much to grieve our
christian men. And that they would avenge him / Ancean required that they would
deffende him / The great barons of thoryent and other hye and noble men
promised him that they would help him certaynlye / Ancean forgate not in the
mean while / but gadred as much people as they might have in the contreye
about him / as they that fro day to day abode the siege he assembled vytaylles
Armures engyns and all other things necessary to people assyeged / And prayed
much ententifly the cytezeyns of the town that every man should make prouysyon
and garnyson for him self as much as he myght^ Then went the cytezeyns of
the town to vyllages and other places there about / And brought all in to the
cite whete. wyn / Oil / and all manner of beestes / so much that the town was
merueyllously garnysshed^ many hye. puyssaunt and noble men were comen fro the
contrees that our people had passed / which were fled in to this strong
town for to keep them self / in so much that it was said / and was truth /

oVre men were approached so nygh the cite that they saw it nygh to them After
they assembled for to take counseyl how they should proceed forth / ffor there
were sum of the barons that counseylled / that they should tarry the siege
unto the new time of the year / ffor the winter came on / which should be much
grievous to lie out / On that other part: there were many of thooste that were
sprad about in the cytees and castellys / which might not lightly be assembled
till after the winter. And ferthermore they said that the emperor of
constantinople should send great people for to help them / Therefore it were well
reason that they should abide them / Also on the other side of the montaynes
they said they should have people al fressh of whom they had great need for
tassiege such a town And in the mean while might the people and their horses
soiourne all the winter in the country about And should be the fressher and
harder and strenger for tendure trauaylle and pain when it should need / The
other barons acorded that they should set the siege forthwith without delay
/ ffor if thenemyes that were in the Cite had the respyte / they should
garnysshe them better of men / of Armures of Engyns / and of other estorementes
than they had then They also that were coming should haste them the more if
the cite were beseged for to help them / To this counseyl acorded fynably all
/ they ordained their bataylles / and came to fore the town / there they lodged
them the x day of octobre^ In our hooste were men well armed to the nombre of C
/ C. C / M. / without wymmen / childeren / and other men that bare no harnoys.
And yet might not all they besiege all the cite / ffor without the montaynes
/ where was thought to leye no siege was at the foot of the hylle unto the
river a great part of the wall in a fair plain which might not be leyed about
with people / In the coming of this great host / was a much great bruyt and
noise of buysyns / of horses of peple^ of Carts and charyottes / But this day
ne on the morn following was no noise / but seemed that the town had been all
void and noman therein but this was don by cause they had much great garnyson
of people and of other things

How after the situacion of the town each of the hye barons of the host were
lodged at the said siege^ capo. lxxxixo.
aNthyoche had conteynyng in the cite / v / yates / toward thoryent / there was
one and was named the port saint poul. and that was by cause it was under the
monastery of saint poul which is hangyng on the territoire / the second was
toward thoccident And the length of the town is between both these yates^ and
that is named the port of saint george / On the side toward byse ben three
yates which all issue toward the River / that yate above is named the port
of the hound. there is a yate to fore this yate / by which men pass the mareys
which is under the walls of the cite / The second is named the port of the
duc^ the river is there well a mile long fro these two yates^ The third is named
the yate of the brygge by cause the brygge is there / by which men pass the
River / ffor between the port of the duc^ which is in the myddle of these three
/ and this that is the last on that side. approuche so the flood of the town
that fro thens it renneth costeyeng the town all ioynyng to the walles^
wherefore it was that this yate ne the yate of saint george our men might not
assiege. ffor noman might come theder but if he went over the River / Buymont
assieged this yate aforsayd with them that were comen in his companye^ beside
him in aualyng down were lodged Robert the duc of Normandye Robert therle of
fflaundres / Steven therle of bloys. And huon le main / These had pourprised
fro the lodgys of buymont unto the yate of thounde / ffor the frensshemen / the
nor man's and the bretons were with them to fore this gate / then were lodged
therle Remont of toulouse and the bishop of Puy with them that were come in
their company. that were the prouynceaulx^ the gascoyns. and the burgoynons /
there was much great people / They took all the place unto the gate next after
/ At this gate were lodged the duc Godeffroy / Eustace his brother / Bawdwyn
therle of henawd / Reynold therle of Toul / Guemes de montagu / And other
barons many which alwey held them with these princes. there were the loraynes:
the henewers they of sessougne / they of bauyere and they of francoine / They
took up all the place almoost to the yate of the brygge / And held the River
that ran there. In this party toward the town was great plente of apple
trees / of fygtrees. and of other trees beryng fruit / which our people cut and
hew of all for to lodge them they of the town byhelde by the hourdeys and
batyllemens of the walls the manner and contenaunce of thooste / And
meruaylled much of the Arms / of the tents / and of the facion and manner
that they had for to lodge them / They were in great doubt / ffor they were
well adcerteyned / that so much and great people would not lightly depart fro
this siege without doing them great damage and harm / There were many that
were so gretely effrayed for their wives. their childeren and their other
friends. that they would that they had been deed and buried long to fore / to
the end that they should not see the destruction which they doubted for to see

How our people assembled in counseyl for to find the moyen for to send for
vytaylle / and of a bridge that they made^ cao. / lxxxx
oWr people that were thus lodged found not about them pastures for their
horses ne for their other beestes / Therefore them behoeued often to pass the
river / and to run through the country / thus did they many times / by cause
they of the town meuyd not yet / And it was a noyous and grievous thing to
pass the River / ffor there was no brygge / but feried over in botes both
horse and man. when the turks of the Cite apperceyned this. they sent
secretly over their brygge their people which took and slew our men that they
fond so sprad in the contre^ And this did they surely ynowgth / by cause they
might not return but by the ryu / and they of thoost might not socoure them.
wherefore our barons co^seylled them to gydre and concluded that they would make a
brygge in sum manner by which they might pass without danger of them of the
town / they fond ships in the lay and above in the river they took and
joined them to gydre and set plankes on them and nailed them in such wise
that three or four men might pass on a front / this brygge did much ease to
all thoost This brygge was nygh the lodgys of duc god^ffroy right against the
yate that he kept / And therefore the yate was named the yate of the duc / ffro
this brygge of tree unto the brygge of stone was a great mile as I said to you
to fore / by this yate and by this bryge was much harm don to our people / And
by the yate named the port of the hounde they grieved much our peple^ ffor
they had a bridge of stone by the town of diverse waters gadred to gydre that
ran there / by that brygge they made their assaylles day and night vpon^ the
people of ther^es of toulouse which kept the gate Oftymes they opened the yates
/ and issued out upon their lodgyes and diverse they hurted and slew many^ And
when they had don they returned in to the town / ffor our^ men might not
pour^iewe them but by the brygge^ therefore hit happed that the bisshoppe of puy
therle of toulouse and the other barous that were there / were more hurt in
their mounture than all the other of thoost

How our people stopped a yate of the town without forth / And of a castle of
tree that they made^ capo. lxxxx^o.
tHis people had great despyte and great shame of the domages and harms that
were thus don to them / And took counseyl that they would beat down the brygge^
And theder they came all Armed under their targes and sheldes of iron and great
plente of pyquoys / And began to smite for to break the brydg^^ but the walls
were so strong and hard that they might not hurt it. And on that other side
they of the town were on the walls and tourettes which threw great stones
and thy^ke on them that so pecked to break the brygge^ that they were fayn to
leave their enterprise and return fro thens / After this they thought of
another thing and made a new castle of tree / And set it against the brygge
for to keep it that they should not pass over it / on them / it was much work
and pain to make it / when it was set and dressyd / Therle garnysshed it
with his men / they of the town adressyd their gonnes and engyns at this castle
and smote it with great stones / And they in the toures shot there at great
plente of Arowes so many in such wise that none durst abide in this castle ne
about it / On a day it happed that our men withdrewe them fro the bridge and
fro there about / And they within opened the yate and issued out by the rowtes /
They that were in the castle of tree fled / And the other set fire on it /
And brent it to ashes / Our men saw well then that they warred not well thus
And ordained three gounes for to shote stones at the brygge. whiles they shot
none of the turks issued out there / But as soon as they cessed. they came
out and made their assaylles as they did to fore^ It displesyd much to our
barons that they might not set no remedy against the coming out of these
turks / At last they acorded that they would take great stones of the Roche
such as were conuenyent for a gate and stop the passage They took an honderd
men and more and stopped the gate oue^ the brydge^ there were so many that it
was done in such wise that it could not be lightly broken again / They had
great trauaylle and pain to make it / But they that were lodged there kept
all armed them that brought the stones^ Thus was the gate stopped in such
wise that thoost abode all in peace there / ffor the Turks might no more make
their assaylles there

How our people were in great meschyef for as much as they of the town issued
and entered in and out with great rowtes Capitulo lxxxxijo.
oNn a day it happed that there went out of thoost as well on foot as on
horsbak a three honderd men / and passed over the bridge of tree. And sprad the
contreye as men that went on foragyng / It is the custom of an hooste for to
goo out so oftymes and return without damage or hurt / Therefore they had
supposed to have been sure / They of the town apprceyued it and issued out with
great plente of people / And went over the bridge of stone and ran on them
that they saw goo so folyly / And sum they slew / And other fled to the
b^dyge of shippis where they supposed to have passed / But thenemyes were there
to fore. And deffended thein the way / in such wise that many of them were
drowned in the water that supposed to have passed over / other of our men
recou^tred the turks that had slain and disco^fyted our men and bare away with
them their proyes and despoylles And ran on them / The Turks fled / and our
men p^urfiewed them sleyng and betyng them unto within the bridge of stone /
They of the town that saw their men so pourfiewe^ ^prang out with great prees
and passed the bridge. and ran on our men / which would have deffended them /
but they might not suffer so great no^bre of people and fled. they followed
them doing to them great dommage til they came to the bridge of shippis / there
they assaylled them so hard / that many men armed fill in the water which
were there drowned and loste^ Our m^n lost there many men on foot and on
horsbak / In this manner were they of thooste in great mesease / ffor they were
better besieged than they of the town / There were many of their enemies in the
woods and montaygnes which often ran upon our people when they saw them goo
without ordenaunce^ and they of the town issued out when it plesed them / in
such wise that our men durst not goo fer fro thooste for to fourage ne for
none other thing / And also in their lodgys were they not assured. ffor the
tydynge was^ that the turks assembled much great plente of people for to smite
in thooste on that one side / and they of the town on that other side should
issue on them /

grievous and a much long thing / Therefore I shall say to you this that longs
to the common / thooste had holden siege unto the third moneth^ vytayll began
to faylle / And (...) great suffrete and scarsenes in thoost / they had in the
beginning largely and great habundaunce both for men and horses. but they made
great waast and more than neded. and so by their oult^age and folly they lacked

And thus brought vytayll to thoste But when the Turks of the town. and also
other in the country had apperceyued this / they made embusshementes and ran
upon our men when they retorned^ or other while when they went forth^ and slew
them sum time all that none returned for to bring tidings to thoost / And

roted on their backs by cause they might find no place to dry them there was
one so great mortalite in thoost / that uneath might be fonden men for to
burye them that deyde / Many that saw this great danger and peril in thooste
went and departed pryuely to Rages where bawdwyn was / and in to Scilice where
other cytees were also / Thus were many slain. And great plente deed of famyne

to the press in such wise that every man would be the best and most valiant

weeping and much great cry and noise well cursed they that time that they so
long had lived that they should see such meschyef happen to them / Ancean saw
that he lost all his men and had none hope for to recoure them / commanded
that that yate should be opened for to receive in to the town them that were

They of the town had much sorrow by cause they saw to fore their eyes the
corses taken up of their friends which they had buried with great costs and
dispenses^ And it displesyd them much that the nombre of their deed men should
be known / whom they had supposed to have kept secret / ffor without them

They smote of three honderd heedes and sent them to The Emperor. for to late him

had told him all this that pancrace had don to him / he had thereof much great
desdayne / Sith he took with him the Earl of fflaundres^ to whom he had more
love and acquaintance than to any other of the barons / And went to buymont

he knew not / that it was longyng to him / ffor a noble man of the country had
given it to him. But when he knew that the duc would not suffer it / By his
curtosye and at prayer and request of the other barons he rendered and
delyuerd to him his said pauyllon to the end that no noise should sourde ne
arryse between them and might let the work of our lord / Thus were they
good friends / Many men merueylled them how that so valiant a man as the Duc
Godeffroy was / In whom was no thing founden to be reprehended was so meuyd /
against so hye and noble a man for so lytil a thing as was a pauyllon. Ne I can
see none other reason. But that a noble heart may not suffer shame / And it
was late him understand that it should be to him a great shame / And also it
should be against his honor if he suffered it to be taken away from him. ffor

How a Christian man Emyrferins which was in Anthyoche acqueynted him with
Buymont / cao. Cxo.
aNthyoche this holy cite that I have spoken of to fore was converted by the
prechyng of saint peter thappostle / always it held well this faith and yet
holds certainly god be thanked When the disloyalte and falsenes of mahomet
^an through thoryent this cite would never receive his law. and when the mighty
men of the country would constrayne them by force to this evil law. they
deffended them well against all such. whereof it happed that when the devil had
set this false believe through all the land of Perse unto the braas of saint
George / and fro Inde unto spain / this cite abode always in the faith of the
truth of Ihesu Criste / Truth it is that fourten year to fore that our
people came theder / the great Soudan of Perse had conquered all the lands unto
Anthyoche / And because they were not mighty to hold it any longer. they yielded
it under the puyssaunce of this great man. Then after came our men for
tassiege it^ Almost all they of the town held the faith of our lord. But
without faylle they had no power ne no seygnorye in the cite. ffor they
meddled of nothing sauf their crafts and their marchaundyses to win their
breed / the turks had the bataylles / and went to arms when it was nede^
there was none so hardy of the christian men that durst arm him / and specially
sith our people came to fore the town The christian me^ that were therein were
holden suspect that they durst not issue ne goo out of their howses / there
were many of such christian men that were of great lygnage to whom was don much
shame^ there was a lygnage of noble men that were beremyens^ They were named in
their langage Bam and Cyrra / that is to say the sons of harbergyers / And
for certain of the same langage were descended their lygnages. and yet ben there
sum that make hawberks / they had a toure which was named the tour of the
two sustres^ In this toure were / ii / brethren that were lords of this
lygnage^ The oldes^ had to Name Emerferyus a much sage and prudent man /
Acqueynted he was and pryue with the lord of the town. in such wise that he
had made him his notarye within the palace / This man herd men speak much
good of Buymont fro the beginning of the siege. And well understood by the
common renommee that he was a wise man. And true of great heart and enterprise
/ Therefore he sent to him his Messager / And acqueynted with him much pryuely
/ and let him know all the being and state of the Cite / and the purpoos of
the turks / but they were both two wysemen there for could they well couere
their counntenaunces / There were but few people about buymont that knew him.

he acorded to deliver to him the toun^ cao Cxjo.
Seven months had tho endured the siege to fore the town / Buymont the wise
and subtle / had many times essayed his friend of the town / how the cite might
be yolden to the christian men So often he sent to him by his sone that said thus
to him in this manner / fair sweet sire* I trow certainly that our lord
Ihesus Criste would that I had this acquaintance with you and this love. ffor
ever sith I have be acqueynted with you. mine heart never rested to draw and
acorde every day more and more^ in your bounte and your manner plesyd me much /
I have very ferme and fast hope that I and the mine shall be yet in time
coming much helped and honored by you of this thing that ye have discouerid
to me / of which I have been merueyllously pensyf / sith I have herd of it / I
have much counterpeysed the ways of that one side and of that other^ ffor I
think well certeynly that if I may deliver my country fro the people that been
enemies of our lord and render and delyuere it to the seygnorye of my faith.
I shall have great guerden of our lord and great honor in the world / But if
it so happed thus that this work were discouerd that I have enterprised to
fore er it came to an end or conclusion / I should be delyuerd to all the
torments of the world / and all my lygnage effaced and destroyed that it
never should be spoken of after. And nevertheless many things be put in
adventure therefore I will discouere to you all my heart. as to him that I
hold for a true friend / if the barons that be in your company will grant
as true men as they be. that this Cite shall be youres for evermore and your
heirs if it may be conquered / I shall put me in adventure so that I shall
deliver to you this tour that I hold / which is much strong and well
garnysshed / And this I shall do for gods love and youres / But if they
entende that every man shall have his part / as of thing gotten by war /
thereupon will I not labor ne do pain / ffor I wot never to what end it
should come^ therefore I pray you fair sweet sire and true friend that ye put you
in deuoyr and pain that this town be youres / not for couetyse but for the
prouffyt of the cite Christian / and I promise to you that the day that I shall
know that it shall be thus granted to you. I shall deliver to you the entree of
the toun^ Always one thing I say to you for certayn^ that if it be not made
within short time that ye shall never day of the world recouere it / ffor every
day come to the lord of this town lettres and messagers certefyeng / that they
that come to socoure the town ben about the river of eufrates which is not
far / And they ben well a.ij / C / M / men of Armes^ if they come an you on
that one side / And they of the Cite on that other / ye may not suffer ne
withstand them / but ye shall be all deed or taken / And therefore take ye here
upon hasty counseyl

it was fer of / Therefore tarried buymont to discouere his heart and his thought
til he saw better his point and time / nevertheless he drew a part duc
godefroy. huon de main the duc of normandye and therle of fflau^dres^ To them
he said that he trusted so much in our lord that if the cite might be
granted to him it might be well in short time conquered. They acorded it and
much preysed in their courage the wit of this man that had in will to
accomplysshe so great a thing / By thaccord of them this thing was discouerd to
therle of toulouse / he ansuerd that he would never if the Cite were taken /
give his part to another man / The barons prayed him moche^ but he would not
consent thereto for nothing / Therefore the thing was in such danger / that
almost the thing was alleloste / ffor Buymont put not the pain / ne his
friend of the town would not but if the town should be all his. Nevertheless for

he commanded them they should do without contradiction / he departed fro his
country with all his people and his power / he passed so far that he came in
to the country of rages / There was told to him that one of the barons of
ffraunce held the Cite of Rages which he had conquered and all the land about
it He had thereof great despyte / and said to fore and er he passed the River of
Eufrates / he should take the town and destroy all the fren Themen that he
should find within / Bawdwyn was not of lityl courage. And had well herd

words of these people that were reported to him / Corbagat commanded that the

But they that kept the town deffended them much well in such wise that they
endommaged much them that were without^ And they within lost no thing They
held them about the town three wekes he had no worship ne prouffyt there. At

him to depart fro the siege / ffor he ought first do that thing for which he
came / that is to say for to take and slay all them that were to fore
Anthyoche. And after in his retornyng in a morowtyde he should have the town of
Rages And Bawdwyn if he were not deed^ they should take and bind him. And
present him to their lord as a sheep or a moton. h^ acorded to their counseyl

hooste of Corbagat. Thise noble men went so ferr that they saw and knew all
their being and s^rengthe / And sith drew them to the barons and said to them
the truth / The barons prayde and deffended them also dear as they had the
werk of our lord / that they would not discouere this thing to the foot men of

How after that Buymont had declared his fayte to all the hooste^ they acorded
that the town should be his / sauf the Earl of Toulouse / Capitulo Cxvjo.
When the barons herd this / they had great joy in their hertes. and anon
acorded to this that buymont required / every man granted his part that he
should be quyte therof^ except only therle of tholouse^ which in a reuerrye
wheryn he was said / that he would not acquyte his part ne give it oner to
noman living* The other barons promised certeynly to hold it / And gaf to him
their faith that they should not discouere it to noman / They prayed him that he
would wisely bring this matter about. And dylygently labor taccomplisshe it /
ffor great peril might come in the taryeng of it / The counseyl departed /
thus This Buymont which was wise and trewe^ spak to the messager that knew
their couyne / And sent him to his friend / And bad him say that the barons
had granted to him that the town should be hoolly his with much glad chere /
Therefore he somoned him by his faith / that he should accomplysshe this next
night holy that he had promised him / One thing happed this same day that was
much helpyng to this work / and to thaccomplisshyng thereof / ffor this friend
of buymont named Emyrferyus entremedled much of thaffayres and things of
ancean and of the town. This same day when he was besy in this work / he sent
his sone that was tho great to his hows for to fetch somewhat / when he came to
the tour hastily / he found that one^ of the great admyrals of the town pleyed
and deled with his moder^ when he saw this / he had so great sorrow in his
^erte^ that he ran again to his fader / And told to him like as ^e had founden
it. The fader was a much wyseman^ And was much sore angry^ And said these
words to his sone. Fair sone it seems not ynowgh to these falls hounds that
they take fro us all that we have. and keep us foul in their seruage^ B^t
with this / they do us all the shame that they may / By the aid of Ihesu
crist^ in whom I believe / I shall labor and do pain to find the manner by
which their power and might shall be lassed mynuysshed and shorted / And they
shall have guerdon for the evil that they have don to vs^ he made then no
semblaunt of Anger that he had / But sent his sone to buymont anon by the
manner that he was acustomed to goo^ And badde him that he should be redy^ ffor
as to him he would hold him this night all his couenauntes / he badde him also
that all the Barons of thooste should issue out abeut none every man armed in
his bataylle^ And make semblaunt for to goo against Corbagat. And after in the
beginning of the night to return again pryuely without noise / And keep them
so armed and ready to do that shall be said to them about mydnyght. Buymont was
much joyous / when he herd this message / And aftir led him to fore the
barons to whom this thing was discouerd / And made him say in their presence
the words as he had brought / The barons when they herd hym^ were much Joyous
/ And said well that this counseyl was good and faithful and of great courage
acorded thereto /

How they of Anthyoche had fere of treson / And how they assembled in counseyl
/ And of that which Emyrferius deposed there at / Capitulo.C / xvijo.
oNe thing happed in this town / that is acustomed often to come in great works
/ They that had the keeping and charge of the town / began to have suspection
within their hertes and deuyned that the Cite should be by trayed / they knew
no reason ne how / ne they apperceyued no great semblaunce / But always that one
spak to that other of the great men / And them seemed that it should fall. So
much aroos this murmur and words that they assembled to fore Ancean lord of
the town / And told to him. that his men had such fere. and it was not without
reson^ ffor the christian men were in the town. and were in doubt that by them
dommage might come to the Cite / They led so Ancean with words that they
made him to be aferd also / Anon he sent for him that was named Emyrferyus^
And told to him how this word ran about / And by cause he held him for a
wyseman / he demanded what counseyl he would give here on / he that was sharp
of entendement and apperceyuyng knew anon / that his lord demanded these
words for to known if he should answer any thyng^ By which he should be
suspecte. And knew well that this assemblee was there made by cause they had
suspection / he thought well to bring them out of this wenyng by his answer /
and said Fair lords ye be hye noble and wysemen. ye ought to conne them good
thancke / And the lord specially of this that they ymagyne and doubt of
trayson / ffor in so great a thing as ye have to keep / ought to be doubted
all that may be fall / ffor we be in peril of our lives of our franchyses /
of wyues^ of Chylderen / and herytages / Thise ben things that ought to be
well understood and kept / But me seems that by two ways may be given
counseyl in this thing in such wise that if any were untrue and such a
ttaytre that would destroy his country he should have no power / This thing
might not be don ne spoken of but by them that have the toures in keeping /
Therefore me thinks if ye have suspection her of ye may well remedy it. By often
remeuyng them fro their places^ ffor this thing may not be devised but by
much great leyser And when ye change them thus often / in such wise that they
that be here this night / shall be set the next night fer thens / where he
shall have no knowleche and her by ye shaltake fro them all the ease for to
commune or speak of any trayson / when they herd this cou^seyl that this
christian man emyrferyus gaf to them / they acorded all well thereto / and by
this fylle from them all the suspection fro their hertes that they had against
them / and thus as he had devised should have be don if it had not ben so late
for it was night and so great remeuyng might not be made but by space of time /
The lord commanded them to keep all the cite hoolly / Thus departed they fro
the counseyl / Emyrferyus that saw well that the thing that he had enterprised
/ if he and Buyuont hasted not / that it should never take good end / Therefore
he thought much to bring his purpoos to effect without that any man should
perceive it /

Of the meschyef that the turks made every day to the christian men that were
in Anthyoche enhabytyng with them cao. Cxviijo.
fRo the beginning that the Cite was assyeged the turks of the town had in
great suspection the Grekes^ Surryens and heremyns^ and generally all the
other Christian men that duellyd in Anthyoche. whereof it happed that the pour
Christian men that had not in their howses garnyson sufficiant for long time /
they made them to void the town and all their meyne. ffor they would not that
the Cite were charged ne encombred with them / They ret^yned the rich men
within by cause they had vytayll ynowgh / they kept them strayte and by falls
occasions robbed them every day and took fro them all their thynges^ They
chaced them to the labors and works of the town / if. they had walls for to
make or amend / They bare the stones the mortar and sand. if they wold^
adresse engyns for to cast stones / or other Instruments of warr^ they must
draw the cordes^ And never as long as they fo^de christian men. they fought
none other for to do such works / And when they had trauaylled long / instead of rewards / they led them and beat them through the streets in such
wise that they had lever to have been cast out of the town. at beginning
with the other than to be received with these falls hou^des that thus grieved
them of the town that were christian / Thus were they acorded^ viij / days to
fore to speak to Emyrferyus friend of Buymont / that they would slay all the
christian men and had don it if one of the admyrals of the town had not ^etted /
and empesshed it / which was always pryue^ and friend of the christian men. he
made to delay it / vij days by this reason^ ffor he said to them. Fair sirs I
hope that the christian men that have assieged us shall depart fro the siege with
in viij days for doubt of corbagat which comes / and if they depart why
shall we slay the christian men that been in this town / And if they depart not^
then may ye doo^ as ye have devised. These.viij. days were now passed. i^
such wise that it was commanded much pryuely to them that had the charge^
that they should ^lee them the same night. then^e the same^ day at none it was
cried through the hooste of the pylgryms / that all they that had horses were
armed. and to draw every man to his bataylle. where he was constituted and
ordained / for to do that their Capytayns should command them. The men on
foot knew nothing what they should do / ne the horsemen neither / sauf they
that buymont had aduertysed^ thus departed they fro thoost all in ordenaunce /
It seemed well that they would goo far / They went forth till it was night /
when it was derke it was commanded that they should return again secretly
without any noise / And that they should hold them armed in their lodgys^ This
valiant man Emyrferius of whom I have spoken to fore had a brother with hym^
But he was not of such courage as he was / the good man had said nothing to
him of that he purposed to do / ffor he doubted much he would not be agreeable
thereto / They were to gydee in the tour at the hour of none when the bataylles
issued of thooste they beheld it by the batayllementes^ Emyrferyus would preue
and know the courage of his brother which was younger than he / And said to him
/ Fair sweet brother I have much great pity of these hyemen that thou see
there^ ffor they be of our creaunce. much faithful and good christian men. Now
ride they also surely. As if they ought nothing to doubt. And their death is
full nygh them. ffor it may not be that they may resist against them that come /
and against them of the town / And if they knew it I trow they would take other
cou^seyl. his brother answered / this is a much folyssh pity that thou have / And
I see the in a great musardye. Certainly it should plese me well / that the
turks had now smeton of all their heedes and slain them all that thou see
there depart / And all the other in like wise. ffor never sith they entered in
to this land / we had never good day ne one good night. but have made us
suffer many euilles by thoccasion of their coming / and therefore I may not love
them But I would that they should have an evil endyng and that right soon. when
emyrferyus had herd these words he doubted to fore what to say to his brother
of his purpoos^ but fro this forth he doubted no more / and began to hate him
much in his courage / he thought well that by him might be destroubled the
great auauncement of Cristendom Therefore he was in great anguysshe how he might
deliver him /

Of the dilygence that buymont made in this work / And how Emyrferyus slew
his brother and delyuerd the town to the christian men / Capitulo Cxixo.
bVymont slepte not this night. ffor he should have been much displesyd / if by
his neclygence this work should be tarried He went often to the Barons that
knew of this thing for to be counseylled / He helde^ in his hand a laddre of
cords much subtylly made / Above it should be fasted to the creucaux of the
wall with good and strong crochettes of yron^ And for to fastne also in
therthe. when it came about mydnyght / he took his messager that knew his
secret pryuely / And sent him to his friend to know / if if were yet time
that he should approuche to the wallys ffor him thought that all the Cite was
in much peace and rest / when this messager came / he had him abide there
stylle and say no word till that the master of the watc^^ were departed and
passyd by^ ffor the custom was such in the cite. that above the watch that
was ordained and aduysed / that a noble and wyseman should search and vysyte
every night the watche^ And amend that as they found amys. And he went thus
three or four times in the night with a great company of people that bare light^
It was not long aft^r that he came and saw in the tour where Emyrferyus was
and saw all things well ordained and in good disposicion^ And it plesyd him
well and passed forth / This man saw then that it was time to perform his
werke^ And said to the messager goo thy way dylygently and say to thy lord
that now is time to do well and that he come to fore this tour^ and see that
he have good company with him and true / The messager departed forthwith /
Emyrferyus entered in to the tour and found his brother slepyng much fast. he
had fere that he should awake er the work were accomplysshyd and that he might
destrouble it. therefore he took his swerd and roof him through both sides and
slew hym^ The messager came to Buymont and told him his erande. he came
incontinent to fore the tour. And the other barons with him that knew of the
work. Each of them had but a few with them but they were good and true.
emyrferius put out his heed and salewed them and they resalewed hym^ and after
aualed a cord down by the wall they took it and bound it fast to the^d^ of
the laddre of cords / when it was bounden and drawn up fas^ned and attached
with the crochettes of iron above. there was none that was so hardy that would
first goo up. when Buymont saw this / he took then the laddre first as a
valyau^t man and ardant t^ccomplysshe the werke^ And went up til he came to the
batillement. Emyrferyus knew anon that it was buymont^ And took him by the
arm and kyssed his hand. Buymont went upon the walle^ And kysshed him
swetly^ He thanked him of the seruyse that he had don / Emyrferyus ladde him in
to the tower. And said to him. Behold and see what I have don for god and
you^ This man that ye see here deed is my brother Germayn / I have slain him by
cause he would not acorde to this work that ye and I have enterprysed. Buymont
had much great Joy. ffor fro then forthon knew he well that his friend
did all in good faith / Then came to the creueuls and put out his heed and
called his people and said that they should come up dylygently by the laddre.
They durst^ not go up / But always supposed it had be deceyuaunce. Buymont that
was much valiant and Just put down his foot on the laddre / And descended
down to the earth and said to them fair lords ye tarry over long / there is
no doubt / ffor know ye certainly that this good man has shewde to me his
brother whom he has slain for love of us / when they herd this they all took
the laddre he that might best best / And mounted up so many that there were men
ynowgh on the wall / Therle of fflaundres went up and Tancre for tenseyne the
other how they should do / when the first towr was well garnysshed with men^
they ran to the other by^ And slew the watch men and held the toures

Of the mayntene of the christian men in this pryse. And of the affraye of the
turks of the toun^ cao..C.xxo
aT the foot of the laddre abode sum of the Barons for to conduyte thooste /
when they saw that they had upon the walls men ynowe that might garnysshe
diverse / towers / They ran hastily to the lodgys for to make the people arm
them / And to draw nerer / to the end that they might al be ready for to enter
in when our men were on the walls / they were not idle / but were noble and
hardy / in such wise that they had anon. x / towers taken all in arenge / And
had slain all them that they found therein And the cite was not yet meuyd ne a
waked / ffor the great men of the town when they herd the noise. had supposed
certainly that they had slain the Christian men / like as they had commanded And
that this affraye had be for none other thing And they meued not out of their
beds. In this party where our me^ were goon up was a posterne. Our men that
were on the walls descended and brake up the locks and opened the yate in
such wise that many entered of our peple^ And after came to the great gate that
was called the gate of the bridge / And all the watch that kept it they
slew. And after opened the gate / A squire of Buymontys ran til he came to an
hye tower which was upon the tertre by the dongeo^ of the town / there be
fyxed the Baner of Buymont his lord. When our people that were in the town
apperc^yued that the day was nyghe^ And the dawenyng appiered^ then they
made to sown their trompettes and ^usynes for to call all the people of the
hooste / The Barons understood the sign. and smote the h^rs with the spor^s.
And entered by the yates which they found opene with all their bataylles^ The
foot men of thooste a wooke that knew nothing of this counseyll. They saw
the tents empty and voyde^ and apperceyued that the town was taken^ then
began they hastily to ^enne to the gayne^ in such wise that none abode other^
The turks of the town a woke and herd the noise and saw the men of arms
through the stretes^ Then apperceyued they in what point they were^ They began
to flee out of their howses and led their wives and chylderen with them when
they fled fro one rowte of our men. they ^ecountred another gretter^ which
slew them alle^ The surryens. the hermyeus and the other christian men of the
town apperceyued that the thing went so^ they had much great joy and took
the arms hastely^ and went forth with our men and told to them the places
where most people were. And where the tresours were^ They them slew the
turks much gladly^ They payned them much to render to them the guerdon of
betynges and torments that they had don to them. Thoost was then entered in
to the town The barons had set their baners on the toures^ great occision and
slaughter had be in the town. they spared noman ne woman ne child / they brak
up doors and chestes^ ye should have seen gold and silver departed in the
streets. It seems well a thing conquered. and won by warre^ what shall I make
long deuyses^ there were slain of them of the town that day moo than ^x^M^ of
whom the bodies lay all bare in the ways and streets

How Ancean lord of authyoche fled by a posterne out of the toun^ And he was
recountred and put to death. cao. Cxxjo.
When Ancean saw that the cite was thus bytrayed^ And that his people that
might escape fled an hye in to the fortress of the dongeon. he doubted much
to goo theder ffor he thought well that the christian men would enuyro^ne
incontinent this tour if be entered. therefore he issued out at a posterne out of
the town. and went allone as he had be out of his wit / Ne he knew not
whether he might goo^ And flee for to keep him. when he went thus by the
feeldes much far fro the Cite. Certain Hermyns met him and knew him. And
much merueylled what this might be^ And after thought that the Cite was taken
And they approached him / like as they would have enclyned to him as they were
woonte / but then they took him and smote him down to therthe / and after
with a sword smote of his heed^ and bare it in to the town / And presented it
unto the barons to fore the people / one manner people was comen in to a^thyoche
which were not of the toun^ that were come for to deffende their law / and
other for to be souldyours / And other for prowess of armes^ and to get
honor and prys^ these knew not well the leyng of the town / and were mounted
upon their horses all armed and begone to run against the hylle toward the
dongeon / and by adventure they met a route of our men thus as they went
sechyng in the town. which ran on them much hardyly^ These manner of people would
have eschewed them and smote their horse toward the valeye / and fylle down of a
bancke in such wyse^ that they were all to bruised men horse harnoys and
abyllementes / there were deed well a / iij / C. some there were that in the town
were born / when they apperceyued in the morning that our men were within^ They
took their horse and rode out by the yates that our men had opened. there were of
our men that went aftir and sued them and brought many of them again whom
they put in prison / some other escaped and ran unto the montaynes / about the
hour of tierce when the town was serched Our people assembled and anon
apperceyued that in all the town was no vytayll^ and it was not wondre / ffor
the siege had then endured nygh.ix^ months and much people had been therein
during the siege / but gold silver preceous Iewellis and vessel of diverse
facions / clothes of sylke. and rich tappets^ and of other things they found
so much that each of our me^ was all charged as much as they might bear / It
came well to point to our pour pylgryms for to find such richesse / after the
great mesease that they had suffered / there were fou^den in the town / v / C.
good horse of arms / But they were riyht lene and wery^ thus was the cite of
Anthyoche taken the year of thyncarnacion of our lord a / M^lxxxxviij / the /

How aftir that our men had made great slaughter of their enemies our men held
counseyl for to take the dongeon / then being seized of the turks / cao.
^C^xxijo.
tHe pylgryms that were theder comen fro many countries by great labor were
then full of shedyng of the blood of their enemies / The Barons assembled in
counseyl and aduysed emonge them. that this werk was not yet parfyght. but that
there was yet trauayll and peril till that the dongeon were taken and goten^
which was right strong / and well garnysshed with walls of the town / they
set good ward and kepers of all the yates And did do cry through all the
town to assault. and commanded that all should come to the tour / that was on
the montayne / when they came theder^ they knew well certaynly^ that this was
not a thing lightly to be gotten. ffor the fortress might not be gotten but by
famyne. therefore they trauaylled but lytil. but withdrewe them and made the
people to return. this montayne that is above the town is divided in tweyne
like as I said to fore by a deep valleye / which is as stepe as it were plom
down / The side which is toward thoryent is much fayrer upon a plain well
broad full of vygnes and land erable^ That other party toward the west is
much hyer as a man should goo up right / And right upon the sommet ot top of
the tertre stondeth the dongeon ferme of over strong walls and thycke toures
/ they be hye and great toward thoryent. and toward northeste about the valeye
it is so deep that it seems a right hell / And it is an hydous thing to
behold It could never be ymagyned how it might be mined / and fro this dongeon
unto the town is a way which is so strayt that with great pain one man allone
may goo or come. The barons acorded that they would close this litil terter and
way. to the end that they of the dongeon should not mow descend ne do evil
ne harm to our men in the cite / They made a wall much strong of lyme and
sonde In which they put men of Arms ynowe and well in point. They set on the
walls stones and engyns ready for to cast stones if the turks descended and
came down. the barons went in to the town for to take cou^seyl of other works.
It was ordained and devised that all men should return and abide there about
this new wall till that the dongeon were taken. sauf the Duc Godeffroye which
by common cou^seyl of all should abide for to keep the gate of the est / and the
fortress that our men had made without the gate that was delyuerd to buymont.
They herd tidings that this great prince Corbagat of whom I have spoken to
fore should arryue shortly / ffor he was then entered in to the land of
anthyoche / It was ac^rded that they should send a wise man unto the see^ and
say to them that were goon for to do their things / that they should return
hastily and bring in to the Cite all the vytaylles that they might find They
them self that were in Anthyoche ran all the country abeut for to seche
vytaylles^ but they found but lytil. The laborers of the plain country were
much joyous that the Cite was in the hands of the pylgryms for they were of
our faith. all that they had hyd they brought^ but it was not much For the
long siege had destroyed the country without and emptyd the town within

How whiles thooste garnysshed the toun^ Sum of thoost of Crobagat came
rennyng to fore it. capo..C.xxiijo.
tHe second day after the town was taken^ whiles our people intended to
garnysshe the Cyte^ came three honderd men of the host al in point of Corbagat
well armed and horsed upon light horses for to see if they might find any of
our men that rode folyly by the countre^ They embusshed them all sauf ^xxx.
the best horsed which came to fore the town. They began to run nycely for to
draw our men out of arraye^ when our men saw them ^hey had great desdayne
/ And wend that it had be a great shame if they found not to whom to speak to
/ sith they were come so fer to fore / A noble man of whom I have spoken to
fore / by whom the hooste had had many prouffytes by his wit and prowess and
was named Rogier de barneuylle. And was of the company of the duc of normandye
he took with him.xv^ knights that ^e had of his meyne^ And came out of the town
against the turks as he that was noble valiant and hardy / And acustomed to
do fair fay^tes^ when he saw them he smote his horse with his spores to^ward
them And they by cautele turned and fledde^ Our men fo^lowed hastily so far
that they launced upon their watc^e they sprange out of the embusshement. And
ran upon our men ffor they were many and well proved in arms. Rogier relied
his ly^til felawship / And came deffendyng him toward the town. when they were
nyghe^ A turk garnysshed with a strong bow smote Rogier through the body in
such wise that he fyl down deed to fore his horse. Anon his felaws withdrewe
them in to the town. The turks descended upon him and smote of his heed^
seeing they that were on the walls / they bare a way the heed and thus
departed / they of the town issued out with great cry and lamentacion as they
that had a great losse^ They took the body and buried it ho^norably and with
great sorrow in the porche of the church of saint peter / The barons
compleyned much above the other this noble man. as they that best knew him /

How the third day after the getynge and pryse of Anthyoche Corbagat with his
host arrived to fore it. cao. Cxxiiijo.
At the third day after that Anthyoche was taken / this great prince
Corbagat came to the cite in the morning at the son rysyng with so great
plente of people that all the country that might be seen fro the highest place of
the town was couerd with them / The barons saw much more people / than they
herd say of. For their host encreced every day / he passed the bridge / And
lodged him between the lay / and the river of hell which is well a mile fro
that one to that other / he had so great plente of knyghtes^ and so great
nombre of tents and pauyllons that the great plain whereof I have spoken to
fore where Anthyoche stondeth ne yet it might not all receive them / But many
of them lodged them in the terrytoryes by / when Corbagat had be thus three
days lodged^ him thought that he was over fer fro the cite / And by his
counseyl would be more ner the dongeon / which the turks held / for to aid
and comfort them / And thought for to put men in to the town by the yate that
was under the dongeon^ when he was lodged on that party. he comprysed fro the
yate of the eest to the west yate all the side of the town toward the south /
by side the part of the eest was a fortress which our men had made / upon a
litil tertre as I have said and was delyuerd to Buymont / But when the town was

as he had said to them / when the other Princes herd this. they mysbyleuyd not
the clerk / They came in to the Church of saint Peter. And said their
confessions. And cried our lord mercy in teres wepynges. and wayllynges / And
repentaunces of their sins. Then began to delue and dygg deep in the place
that the clerk had showed to them They fond the spear like as he had said to
them Then had they a Joy emonge them so great. like as every man had had as
much as he might / They ronge the belles. And th^s thing was anon spread al
about the town. They ran a^le to the church hastily. And saw this noble
relyquye which was doluen out of therthe. Then^e were they recomforted all
both men and wymmen pour and rich / as they had our lord among them and seen
hym^ there were thus many other good men that said certainly that certain
vysyons of Angeles and apostles were appeared to them / By these things the
people forgate much of their meseases^ The bishop of puy and other holy men
that were in the company said to the pylgryms that our lord shewde to them
tokene and sign / that shortly he would send to them his aid and his cou^seyl
They concluded all noble and unnoble. men and wymmen / gre^e and lytil / And
swear upon the holy relyques / that if our lord would deliver them out of the
peryll^ in which they were. And give them vyctorye of their enemies. that they
should never depart fro this holy company unto the time that they had conquered
Iherusalem that noble Cite where our lord suffered death for to save his peple^
And should deliver the holy sepulcre out of the hands of the false mysbyleuyng

How Peter theremyte was sent by our men unto Corbagat / the words what he
sayde^ And the answer of the said Corbagat Capitulo Cxxxvjo.
tHey had suffered this famyne. xxv^ / days in the Cite / In so much that the
people to whom our lord god had sent good hope in their hertes began much to
be comforted / and fylle all to one will in such wise that they said among
them that it were good to bring their mesease to an end / Therefore was their
common acorde that they should fight with the turks that had assieged them ffor
them thought a fayrer thing that if our lord would that they deyde in bataylle.
that they should do it in deffendyng their cite that they had conquered to the
Cristiente. than to languysshe and to faylle within without essayeng if our
lord would aid them / hereof sourded a common word emonge them that all cried
bataylle^ bataylle / the bataylle^ when they might see any of the Barons^ All
they said that they tarried all to long. This word was thus meuyd of the mean
people. The barons thought that this enterprise might well come of our lord And
so by common acord they assembled in cou^seyl. they allowed much this that the
people made this request^ and acorded that they would send to this proud prince
Corbagat Peter theremyte which was an holy man much wise and well bespokin.
And delyuerd to him for felaw a valiant man named hellom true and of great
wit that could well speak the langage of the sarasyns. And specially the
langage of perse / They charged them with the message like as ye shall here what
they said to Corbagat^ Thise two sad men to fore said did do demand trews
for to goo to the said Corbagat / ffor they would speak with him in the name of
the pylgryms / hit was granted with good will They went out of the Cite and
took with him good company which were assygned to them / they went so far
that they arrived at the pauyllon of this noble prince Corbagat^ They saw him
sytte in much great bobaunce emonge his rich men / Peter salewed him nothing
ne made to him honor ne reuerence^ But spak heeryng all in this manner / This
holy company of hye and noble men / barons noble knights and other. people of
our lord god that been yonder / within the cite / send to the and comaunde that
thou depart fro this siege / and that thou no more assaylle them / but late
them have and keep the town in pees which our lord Ihesu crist has delyuerd
to them for to hold his faith and for to do him seruyse^ ffor saint peter the
prince of thappostles / upon the creaunce of whom our faith is founded. has
converted it first by his prec^yng / And by the merueyllous miracles that he
did / our people has conquered it not long sith by the will and aid of our
lord upon the turks that have holden it with wrong and by force a certain
time. Therefore thou ought to suffer us to enjoy our heritage / And return
thou in to thy country. and if thou will not so do know thou for certain
that within the third day swerdes shall fynysshe and end this debate. And to
the end that thou complain not that we desire and will the death pourchasse of
so much people in common bataylle. they shall offer to the this / that is to wete
/ if thou. wilt fight in thyn own person. they shall send against the^ one al
so hye a prince as thou art^ to whom thou shall fight. And which of you may
vaynquysshe and overcome that other^ shall conquer the quarelle for evermore
without other debate. if this thing plese the not / take certain nombre of
thy men. v^^x. or xij / or as many as thou wylt / and our pilgryms shall set
as many against them without any moo of that one side and that other^ And that
they that shall win the feelde shall allewaye have the gain of this debate.
When Corbagat herd this message he was much wroth and angry and had great
desdayne and despyte / Then he turned him toward Peter and said to him /
Peter they that has sent the hether^ ben not in such point as me seems that
they should off^e to me for to chose of their deuyses. But they be brought by my
pussaunce and ^^reng the that they may do nothing of their will / But I
shall do with them all my playsyre / But return thou and say to these
musardes and say to them that have made the to mean fro the Cite and come
hether^ that they understand not yet^ the maleurte that they be in / And
believe certainly / that if I had wold^ I had or now broken and destroyed this
town and set my men therein by force^ in such wise that the christian men had
be all slain / men and wymmen / lytil and great. But I will that ye abide in
more caytyfnes and mesease^ dyeng and languysshyng for hongre / like as other
houndes^ And when it shall please me I shall enter in to the toun^ and all them
that I shall find men and wymmen of couenable eage. I shall put them all
bounden hands and feet in pyetous estate. And shall led them all to my lord
for to serve him. And they shall be his esclaues / All the other I shall slay
with the swerd. like an evil tree that will bear no fruit /

How the said Peter returned in to the town. and would openly have said his
message / and of the subtyl counseyll of the duc which would not suffer it /
cao. C^xxxvijo.
pEter theremyte understood his pride which was great and of the great
quantite of people that he had / And also of his Rychesses which were over
much / Then he departed and came again in to the town. he would have said the
message of Corbagat openly in the presence of them that would here him / ffor
theder ran great and small. But the duc Godeffroy that was much wise and knew
much. drew him a part and called only the barons and bad him say that he
has founden. he recounted to them alle^ as he that had well retained in his
mind / and could say and utter it in the best manner / The duc doubted that
if the people had herd this great pride and the menaces that Corbagat had said /
that they should be over much abashed and feced. Therefore he commanded to
Peter that he should say none other thing / But that only Corbagat desired and
demanded the bataylle against them. And that they should make them ready. Peter
acorded well therto^ And said to them like as the duc had commanded him / And
uneath Peter had said the word / But that all cried with one voys / And we
will also the bataylle against him in gods name. They shewde well by their
sight and semblaunce^ that the desire of the bataylle was great in their
hertes^ All their meseases were forgoten for Joy to have the vyctorye^ The
Barons when they saw that their people made such joy they were much glad And
much the more trusted in them. By common counseyl they ordained the day of the
battle on the morn / And that thus would Corbagat have it^ they byleuyd it wel^
And hastily went every man to his lodgyng. There ye should have seen Armourers
put in poynt^ hauberks and helmes fourbousshed / swerdes and custrellis whette
/ This night slepte they not in the town noman / They that kept the horse took
good head this night / And made all thing ready. As soon as it was night. It
was cried upon pain of death that all man should be in the morning to fore the
son rysynge all armed as he best might / And draw him in to the bataylle
where as he was ordained / And that every man should follow the baner^ of his
Captain / when the spryngyng of the day apper^d in the morning the men of the
church were ready f^r to sing masse^ And song devoutly / They that should goo
to the battle were confessyd. and all received the body of our lord. which
gaf to them surete of body and of sowle^ All rancour and wrath were entierly
perdonned / by cause they would be in parfyght charyte^ And therein do the
seruyse of our lord which says in the gospel. In this shall all men know
that ye be my disciples. if ye have love and charity emonge you / when they
were thus ready / our lord sent to them his grace / which gaf to them so great
hard^nes^ that they that were the day to fore so ferdful / feeble and been that
they might not sustain them self for feblenesse. becam strong and deliver. in
such wise / that the arms that they ba^^ weyed nothing as them semed^ and
were hardy and vygorous. so that there was none so litil but he had talente to
do great thing in the bataylle^ The time came that the bisshops and all the
other men of the church were reuested as for to sing masse^ they held the
cross / and the sainctuaryes with which they blessed the people And
recommaunded them to god^ They granted pardon and remyssyon to them of all
their sins. if they deyde in the seruyse of our lord To fere all the other
the bishop of puy preached and spak to the barons. And prayed them that they
should thyncke to avenge the shame of our lord Ihesu Criste^ that these untrue
sarasyns had don to him so long in withholdyng of his heritage. At last he
blessed them with his hand^ and commanded them to god devoutly

How Corbagat was aduertysed of thyssue of our people and sent his Archiers
for to deffende the bridge. And how they were disconfyted^ Capitulo / Cxxxixo.
When they h^d thus devised their bataylles / in every battle they had set
men on foot. It vas acorded emonge them that they a foot should goo to fore^
And the knights that came after should keep them. It was deffended and cried on
pain of death that none should be so hardy that should entende to any gayn As
long as any turk deffended him / but when our lord had given them the
vyctorye. Then should they return and might tarry to take and gadre the
despoylles. Corbagat fro the beginning of the siege of the cite had always
doubt and great suspection tha^ our people should sodanly come upon his hoost^
And specially sith that peter theremyte had be with him in message. And therefore
he had commanded to them that were in the dongeon. that if our men thought to
issue they should sown a busyne / And set out a baner where they should issue
/ whereof it happed that when these bataylles were renged to fore the yate to
fore they issued about the hour of pryme / They of the tour made the sign
like as they were commanded. Corbagat understood that our men cam^ And anon he
sent two thousend Archiers to the bridge to keep it that they should not passe^
when the turks came theder for to mayntene the passage / they descended all
afoote^ The yates were opened our men issued after thordenaunce that was
devised. Huon be main with all his bataylle came first un to this paas. which
was kept with his enemyes^ his archiers and men a foot tarried a lytil and
might not pass in no wise / when huon the noble man apperceyued this he smo^e
the horse with the spores and so smote in on both sides. that it was to late
for the turks a foot to take their horses / Then turned they fleyng
defendyng them and shotyng with their bows Ancean de Ribemont rode against them
and beat and held the rowte so short allone that his men that came after him
might come and smite in among them and delyuerd many And oftymes he plunged so
deep in the press that certainly our men had supposed he had been lost. but
when he came again he discouerd him well and made large place about him. All men
bebelde him. he gate there much great honor and prys. Huon le main forgate
not his swerd^ And he did so moc^e that our pylgryms had by him good luck and
hope at this first assemblee / Therle of fflaundres and the duc of Normandye
with the valiant earl of henawd came to this chaas / The Archiers of the turks
that so fled were so evil mened / that they were but a few when they
returned in to thoost / Our men followed them till nygh their lodgys^ many of
them they beat down that never releuyd^

How our men reioysed them of a dew or rousee descendyng then fro heaven. And
of their mayntyen in approchyng the turks. Capitulo C / xl
oNe thing happed when our men issued out of the town / that ought not to be
forgoten / ffor when these Archiers were disconfyted. the latynes came after in
their ordenaunce a soft paas / Then began to fall a rain or a dew. so
sweet a rousee was never seen / It seemed to every man verytably. that it was
the benediction of our lord and the grace of heaven that descended upon them /
Anon they were as fressh and al so light as they never had suffered mesease.
This refresshement was not only in the men^ but all their horses were anon so
strong so fresshe and so rejoiced / As they had had always all that which was
nedeful for them. This was much apperceyued that day certaynly^ ffor the
horses that many days had nothing to ete sauf leeues of trees and skorches or
Ryndes were in this bataylle more strong and more penyble / than were the
horses of the turks. which had always as much as they might / The Capytayns
acorded that they should draw them toward the montaynes which was fer fro the
Cite well.ij. miles / ffor if the turks which had much great plente would goo
thederward / they should be between our men and the town and should close them
in. In this manner went one bataylle to fore another without this / That one
touched another in any wise / when the turks saw them alle^ they merueylled
and were abasshed^ ffor they had supposed / that they had not be but a few
enclosed in the town / Now they seemed / by the miracle of our lord that they
were as many of them / as were of the turks and yet moo. Emonge the men of
arms were the men of the Church reuested with awbes and stools they that
were preestes^ And the clerkys in surplys / and each of them bare a cross in
his hand / they that were abyden in the town were on the walles^ reuestyd also
in prayers and oroysons and teeris cryeng mercy to our lord that he would have
pity of his people / And save them that day and that he would not suffer that his
name and his faith should torn to reproach by the mescreauntes and hethen people

How Corbagat ordained his bataylles / And how the two hoostes marched to gydre
in bataylle. / C.xljo.
bY the signs that they of the dongeon made to them of thoost and by the
tidings that the Archiers brought / Corbagat knew and understood certaynly^
that our men were issued out of the Cite and came toward him for to fight.
Then of this that he was then adcerteyned / he had desdayne to fore and
holden it for mocquerye^ he took counseyl of his barons / And hastily ordained
his bataylles^ by the counseyl of his wysemen / And specially of them that were
born in Anthyoche^ of whom he had many with him. He made a bataylle of much
great plente of knights the best and most hardy that he had / This bataylle
delyuerd he to Solomon / of whom ye have herd in diverse places to fore. He
commanded that they should draw them toward the see^ to fore er our men should
have taken / and pourprysed all the^ plain between the montayne and the Cite.
This great bataylle came then^e to fore^ And was staked as between two towns
and closed / His other bataylles he set in point by leyser. And made that one
to goo to fore another as he that know ynowgh of the ^aytes of war / And
after spak to the Capytaynes and said to them. that they should mayntene them
as hye men and good knyghtes^ and not to be aferd ne esmayed of these Caytyues
/ men en^amyned evil armed. and all to bruised of the great trauaylles that
they had suffred^ when our men had pourprised entierly the plain in such wise
that they doubted not to be closed in / They approuched so nyghe the turks.
that the turks might shote at them / They made their trompes and busynes to
sown lowd^ And spored their horses the three first bataylles to gydre / well
found they that received them ffor the turks were great men and well armed.
Our men did right well in this coming on / The ffrensshemen. ^flemynges
contained them vygorously in brekynge the press ^ But then came so great
rowtes of turks / that it behooved the other bataylles of our men to assemble
hastily. for to socoure the three first bataylles. They were all at the meddle.
sauf the last bataylle which buymont conduyted as ye have herd^ There should
ye have seen fires skarmoche of swerdes of maces and axesse. the malles were so

and crestes of diverse colors wrought with fyn sylke. ffro the master palace
were aleys in to other tents like to streets in a great toun^ There might sytte
in the great halle moo than two thousand men / when our men had recuyelled thus
the rychesses and despoylles / they all made great trusses full of rich
things and charged them on their horses and backs and entered in to the Cite
of Anthyoche^ if they then were glad and joyous It was no merueylle. ffor in
long time to fore. fylle ne happed such adventure in Cristie^te / They
rendered and gaf to our lord many thanks and graces of lawde with all their
very hertes humbly and devoutly. ffor well knew they that all was comen fro
him / The turks which were in the dongeon had well seen that their people were
vaynquysshyd / And had none hope then to be rescowed ne of no socoure.
Therefore anon as the barons were entered in the cite they made them to speak and
trete with them. And acorded to gydre that they all should take their wives and
childeren and bear with them such goods as they had / and render and give
over the dongeon. The baners of our barons were set above on it then. The
works of our lord Ihu crist ben much hye and merueyllous^ ffor fro right
great pouerte^ came our people to over great rychesses in so short a time / It
is much good to affye and trust in him that has such power and might. It was
meruayl of the disease and pou^rte that our barons had suffered / The valyau^t

had great pain to get it. he had despended all his hauoyr and good entierly
for to sustain the pour gentilmen^ in such wise that he had nothing him

beginning. that were brought to so great pouerte that this day they rode on
asses. and on pour mares. And many hye men as knights valiant and hardy might
not cheuysshe for to ride. but went afoot among the foot men. where they
held much well their place / ffor they mayntened and taught the mean people how
they might do to their enemies grettest dommage. The power of perse was much
affebled this day^ For there were so many slain and deed that all therthe there
about was couerd^ The nombre of them that were slain was never verytably*
known / Much was changed the state of our men. ffor he that in the morning
issued out all pour in such wise that he had not for to ete / At even he
entered in to the cite rich of good and of v^taylles / in such wise as he
might have holden a great court and company. This good adventure which

more great honor and solempnyte / The turks had cast and put him onte with
great shame and had don to him many euyllis for the faith of our savior Ihesu

How the knights of Rages would have betrayed Bawdwyn their lord. And how he
was thereof aduertysed^ cao. C.L
sO much people of Christian men came to Rages that it displesyd much to the
Cytezeyns of the town / And thermyens and latyns discorded in many things.
ffor without faylle our men would have the seygnorye. They did many ennoyes
and vylonyes to their hosts within their howses. The Earl him self by cause he
had so great plente of men of his own countre^ he called the fewer and less
to counseyll of the noble men of the Cite / By whose help he was comen to his
hyenesse and noble lordship. They had thereof much great desdayne within their
hertes^ And repented theinof that they had chosen him and set him to be their
lord over them / ffor they doubted that therle which was so lyberall as he
that gaf to every man / should on a day take all that they had^ Therefore they
se^te to the admyrals of the turks. that were their neighbors that they would
pourchasse gladly by their help / how therle Bawdwyn should be slain. or at
lest put out and chassed away fro the Cite in such wise that he should never
return. The turkmans acorded well to this werk. This matter was so ferforth that
they of Rages took all their goods pryuely. And set it in the howses of
their acqueynted neighbors in Cytees and castellys there about. whiles they
spak and aduysed of this treyson / A friend of therle Bawdwyn came to him and
recounted this fayt al a long / he merueylled much thereof / And did inquire
of this thing. And found that it was so / He knew well them that had ordained
this trayson^ And by whom it should be doo^ And secretly he sende^ his men and
took the Capytayns of this falsenes he put out their eyes of their heedes.
Other that had not so much trespaced he chassed them out of the toun^ And took
all that they had^ Sum there were that he let dwell stylle in the Cite.
but he took their good as much as he might get / he had well by thoccasion of
this murdre that these traytres devised ^xx / M / besau^tes But he departed
all to the pylgryms. that had helped him to take the castellys and fortresses
and sum Cytees about Rages / He was much dradde and doubted much of his
neighbors in such wise that none of them durst enterprise any debate against
him / The great and hye men of the contre would gladly have pourchaced the
moyens and manners for to be delyuerd of him if they had might /

How therle Bawdwyn was in danger of death by the treson of a turk named Balac

acquaintance that he had with the Christian men. The Earl thought nothing but
all well / And said that he would go^ at his request to this fortress at the
day appointed between the^ both / Therle came theder with an honderd horsemen
Balac (...) to fore and as a falls traytre had hyd an honderd of his men well
armed. within the fortress / when they were arrived to fore the fortresse^
Balac prayed therle / that he would come up on hye. and see the place how strong
it was. And that he should bring but few men with hym^ ffor he said he had
certain ^hynges of which he might take harm / if they all entered ^ The good
Earl would have done so. but he had in his company a valiant knight well
aduysed and a wise man / which aduertysed his felaws other knights how it was
great peril and danger so to let him goo And they would not suffer him but
retained him by force / ffor they doubted much the malice of this man / in
such wise that in their hertes they had suspection of treson / The Earl abode
by their counseyl / and sent up.xij. of his men well armed in to the toure for
to see if there were any thing to doubt / he held him among his men they that
went up anon apperceyued well the trayson. ffor the Turks sprange out of
their places where they were hyd^ And took thise.xij. men by force^ and
desarmed them and retained them bounden hands and feet^ when the earl knew
this^ he was much sorouful for his men that he had thus lost. Then he drew
him forth and spak to balac / And much prayed him and coniured him by the
feaulte and oath that he had made to him that he would yield his men to him / or
at lest set them at rawnson / and he would give for them as much as he
would have. Balac answered to hym^ that he trauaylled for naught / ffor he should
never have none of them / But if he would give to him the Cite of Sororge which
had been his to fore. Therle saw that this fortress was not lightly to be
gotten. ffor it was over strong and stood in a strong place and rychely
garnysshyd / And returned to rages much anguysshous of the paryll that he had
be in^ when he would by thatyceme^t of this felo^ turk have goon up in to the

Sororge to keep unto a much wise valyau^t and good knight named Foubert de

herd say that his lord had been thus almost be bytrayed / and how he had
lost.xij. men / he was sory^ and thought how he might help them against this false turk that had don this feet. It was not long after that in a night he
set a busshement nygh unto this fortress a part of his men^ and in the
morning he with a few of his company came to fore this toure and took the
proye of beestes. They that were on hye on the bataylleme^t saw that they were
but a few / And told it to balak and to the other men that were in the
fortress / They took their ho^ses hastely^ and followed them / for to rescowe
that which they droof away / In such wise they exployted that they came upon
thembusshement / They sprange sodanly out and closed them in / Foubert
returned upon them And slew I wot not how many but^ vj / he took a live /
ffor whom he had incontinent vj of our men of them that he held in his
fortress / It was not long aftir that four of the other escaped out of the
fortress and brake their prison whiles their kepars slepte. when balak saw /
that there were nomoo but two. he dype do smy^e of their heddes. ffro than forth
on therle bawdwyn that had acqueyntance to diverse admycal^ about him would
never after acqueynte him more ne trust any turk / But eschewed their
companyes and their Amytee^ And that he shewde well sone after. ffor there was an
hye and great man a turk in that contre named Balduc / of whom I have spoken to
fore / which sold this Auncyen Cite named Samoloc unto bawdwyn / And this turk
had encouenaunted and promised that he should bring his wife and childeren
within Rages / but he sought falls occasions for to delay this thing / On a
day he came to bawdwyn as he was acustomed to do. And Bawdwyn demanded him why
he did not that he had couenaunted and promised ^e ^egan to excuse him by
things that were not true. The Earl took him and Incontinent did do smite of
his heed

great presents and honorable and vytaylles as for naught fro all parts / In

Calyphe of Egypt held this Cite on the sea side under the power of the
Calyphe of Egypt / This baylle issued out by saufco^duyt^ and spak to duc
godefroy. to whom he offered vj^M^ besauntes. and many great yeftes above that
for to depart and reyse the siege fro thens. The duc would in no wise here
these words / but said that it were treson and vntrouth^ and god forbede that
I should take such hyre he then departed when he saw he might not make his
bargayn with the noble duc^ After he sent his messagers to therle of tholouse^
and offered to him this great sum of money / if he might find the moyen to
reyse the ^^ege fro this town. It was said that he received the money and for
to make the barons to depart / he found a lesynge / ffor he did to be said
to them. that he was well acerteyned by messagers and lettres / that the Soudan
of Perse had so much anger and desdayne of this that Corbagat his conestable
had be disconfy^ed and so much people of his slayn^ that he assembled all his
^ower And came with great people for to fight. and to destroy them all^ that he
could find of the christian faith. Thise tidings sen^e therle of toulouse by
the bishop of Albare to the duc a fo re said and to therle of fflaundres. and
sent to them his lettres. by which ^e prayed them much swetly and expressly
that they would leave their siege. and come dylygently to hym^ in such wise that
they might be all to gydre when this people cam^ when the Duc and other Barons
herd this thynge^ they were much anguysshous and meuyd. ffor they supposed
certainly: that all this had be true* Anon they departed fro gybelet^ by the
cite of valerne they went / which was above the castle of margat^ sith they
came to marche^ / which is the first cite of the land of fenyce^ when they
went toward the northeest fro thens they came to the cite of cortuose There is
an Isle / where sometime was a Cite / there abode the Ships their naure. I
wot not how many days. after they hasted and came to fore the Cite of Archys.
Tancre issued out of thoost. and came a^enst them / And told to. them all a
long the tromperye and the barat that therle of toulouse had don* They were
much angry / therefore they lodged them a part fro them / that had do broken
their syege^ The Earl knew that he had (...) the love of the barons that were
new comen. therefore he sent^ to them messagers / that said to them in his name
much fair w^rdes / And brought to them great yeftes / wherefore in short time
it happed that they were all repeased and amyable and good friends to gydre /
sauf only Tancre which acorded not with hym^ but accused him of many thynges^
A fore the coming of thise last barons / the people of therles of toulouse
might nothing auaylle and prouffyte against the Cite which they had assieged^
But now they had great hope / that it should now soon be brought to an end /
and accomplysshyd by thayde of them that were new come / Nevertheless it fill
not so as they supposed. ffor all the times that they contryued by any engyne
for tassaylle the walls always it fill contrary to that they purposed / and
they of the town brake all their ouurages / in such wise that they lost
their costs and payne^ It appeared well that our lord had withdrawn fro them
his aid and his good will. They within the town slew many of them without.

How thoost murmured of the spear founden in Anthyoche / and of the great
miracle that happed in the presence of all the host Capitulo CLxjo.
tHere was renewed a word^ by which the common people and / also so^me of the
barons which began to doubt of the spear / that was founden in Anthyoche.
like as ye have herd to fore^ ffor sum said certainly that it was the very
spear that opened the Side of our Lord on the cross / And that was with his
precious blood bydewed^ And by reuelacion of our lord had be founden by an
holy good man for to recomforte his people which had great necessyte and need.
Other said that it was not but falls (...) / tromperye and abuse / ffor therle
of toulouse had fonden this and contryued / for to mean the people to draw and
get silver of their offrynges / And this altercacion was meuyd by a priest
named Arnold chppellayn and much acqueynted with the noble duc of normandye^
he was well lettred / but he was not of good lyf^ he was over malycious and
pourchassoure of discordes / As ye shall here afterward in this book^ This
rumor was great in thoost as I have said. The man that had fond the spear
herd the doubt of the people / And came to fore the barons much hardily. And
said to them in this manner / Fair lords doubt ye nothing that this work has been by barat n^ by tromperye^ For theryn has be none / But it is comen of god
/ And certainly for the comfort of the christian people. s^ynte andrew appeared to
me. by the will of our saueour Ihesu crist which devised to me all the
manner. how I have founden it / And for to show to you / that this that I say
is troth / I pray you that ye make a great fire and merueyllous / And I shall
enter in to it / And hold the spear in my hand and shall pass and goo through
hool and sauf. when they herd this they acorded all therto^ The fire was made
and brennyd light which was greet and merueyllous. And this was on the blessed
good friday / And it plesed them that this thing should be thus p^euyd the same
day that our lord was smeton to the heart with the same spear / he that thus of
fred him self thus and enterprysed for to preue it was named Peter bertilme we
clerk / and but litil lettred after that it could be understand without forth^
and was a much simple man ^ Then was all thooste assembled about the fire
/ Peter came forth and kneled down for to recommande him unto god / when he had
made his prayer / he took the spere^ And entered in to the fire / And passed
through it^ and was nothing on him perysshed n^ hur^e that any man could see or
know. when the people saw this all they ran for to kiss him / And made to
him much great joy. Of this doubt then they wend verily that it had be
quenchid But yet sourded a gretter error and murmur than to fore ffor it was
not long after but that this Clerk deyde / then said sum that by
thanguysshe of the fire he took his death And that should be thoccasion therof^
The other said that he issued out al hool and sauf fro the fire. But it was
the will of ours lord sith the truth was known that he should deye thus^ or
peradventure the prees that came upon him was so great. when he issued ou^ of
the fire / that he was thereby hurt that he (...) / In this manner murmured yet

with them were comen the messagers of the Calyphe / which brought to our barons
fro him words much diverse and much changed fro that^ they had sent to them
to fore Anthyoche^ ffor then he sent to them that they should conteyne them
vygorously against the Sowdan of Perse^ And they should have of him great aid of
gold of silver and of vytaylles. Now had he changed much his langage^ ffor he
sent them word that he thought^ that he did much great thing for them / if
he suffered that the pilgrims might goo to Iherusalem.ij. C / to gydre / or.iij^
C / all unarmed. And when they had made their prayers^ and don their
pylgremage to return saufly agayn^ when our barons herd this^ they had hereof
great desdayne / And said to the messagers. that they should return again to
their lord / and tell him that by his license ne leave would they not goo to
Iherusalem unarmed one after another. But they should goo maulgre him / all to
gydre in bataylles renged / and the baners raised and desployed / Now I shall
say to you why the Calyphe of Egypt was reysen in so great pryde^ when our men
had discomfyted Corbagat to fore Anthyoche. The power of the Soudan of Perse
was much affebled^ in such wise that none of his neighbors doubted him / ne
fered to make war against him. ffor he had always the werse^ By which
occasion it happed that a conestable of the Calyphes of Egypt named Emites /
had taken the Cite of Iherusalem fro the men of the soudan of Perse which had
holden it. xxxviij year. Therefore saw now the Calyphe that he was at his

oN that other side were comen messagers fro the emperor of Constantinoble^

ewangelyes that all such Cytees and Castellys by them conquered / which had
be under the power of Constantynoble should be rendered to him as his owen through
out all the land / to Iherus^lem Now buymont did contrary this which held
Anthyoche / and the other Barons that had given it to hym^ Thus spak they of
the couenauntes / But they spak not of all / ffor without faylle truth it
was that they had couenaunted this / but the emperor had promised to them that
he should follow them with his great host / And should furnysshe to them great
plente of vytaylles by se^^ he was the first that had broken the covenant and
promesses^ ffor he had not don that one ne that other / And he might well have
don it / And therefore they were not bounden to hold his couenauntes made by
our barons. by cause he held not that he had promised / ffor the law will
not that a man shall hold covenant to him that holds not his. Thus answered
the barons to them And therefore said they that the yefte that they made to
buymont of the Cite of Anthyoche ou ght to be ferme and stable. And so would
they mayntene it to him and to his heirs for ever / when the messagers herd
this^ they much prayed the barons that they would tarry their going to
Iherusalem til that the emperor were comen / ffor they said that without
fault ^e would come to fore thentree of Iuyll. And bring with him much great
plente of people / And if they would do thus much for hym^ ^e should conne them
great thank / And shall give to each of the barons many great and rich yeftes
/ and also shall depart largely to the gentil men and to the footemen^ when ou^
barons herd this they said that they would counseylle them to gydre^ and drew
them a part^ Therle of toulouse acorded well to this that they should abide so
great an aid as was the puyssaunce of the emperor / And said he supposed
certainly. that he should come / as it was said. but the other supposed that he
said so for to keep the barons and other men at siege. til the cite were
taken / ffor it should be much dishonour^ and fowl for him to depart f^o thens
without accomplysshyng that which he had enterprised^ The other barons acorded
nothing thereto: but would that they should goo dylygently assiege the holy cite
of Iherusalem for to do their pylgremage^ and accomplysshe their vow / For
which they had suffered so many trauaylles and disease^ For they knew much
well the delay of the emperor / and (...) ^ayr words full of tromperyes and
deceytes^ Therefore it was not their oppynyon for to trust any more his covert
dissimylacions / Thus sourded a great debate between the barons. And might not
acorde / of which it happed that he that held the cite of trypple which had
offered to them so much good by covenant that they should depart fro the siege
/ and goo out of the land. when he knew that the barons were emonge them self
in discorde^ he would no more offer to them any thing / but enterprised so great
hardynes^ that he would fight against them / The barons acorded thereto / and
left the Bishop of Albare for to keep the lodgys. And when they had so doo^
they went so all in bataylles ordained toward trypple / when they came there
they fond the lord of the town and the Cytezeyns out with great plente of men
on horsbak and afoote where they had ordained their bataylles and abode our

toulouse had hold siege to fore this Cyte^ And had no thing preuayled^
wherefore they preysed our men much the less / than they did byfore^ But when

of the Cou^^re for to demand of them in what side they might best assiege
the Town / They saw well that toward thoryent^ Ne toward the Southe they might
naught do for the deep valeys that been there. Therefore they acorded to set
the siege to fore the northeste / Wherefore it was so that fro the yate named
the yate of Saint Steven which stondeth in the Northeste unto the other yate
that stands toward the weste / And is named the yate of Dauyd were lodged
all the Barons and the other pylgryms^ The valiant Duc of loreyne had the
first place / In the second was therle of fflaundres. In the third was the duc
of Normandye / The fourth place held Tancre beside a tour of a Corner which
yet is named the tour of Tancre / And other great men were lodged there with
hym^ ffro this toure unto the yate of Occident comprysed therle of toulouse the
place and the people that were with him / But after Tancre saw that by cause
the tour defended the yate so well / and also for the valeye that was so nygh he
might but lytil prouffyte there. therefore by the counseyl of the wise men that
knew well the being of the town he remeuyd fro thens / and went on the tertre

yate named mount Syon^ the Cite was no thing assieged The fyft day after that
thoost was lodged to fore the Cite / it was acorded comynly and cried through

the work of our lord / In their coming on they took the barbyca^nes that were
right ayest them. And the turks embatilled them within the great wallys / They
of the town were so effrayed of the great hardynesse and prowess that they
saw with our people and had over great fere. in such wise that they lost
all their hope for to deffende the town. And was well known afterward / that
if the talent of our men had endured and that they had had skalyng laddres and
castellys by which they might have approuched the walls of the toun^ They had
taken it certainly. but when thassault had endured fro erly of the morning
that same day unto one of the clok of the same day at after none / They
apperceyued well that with out engynes they might not do great hurt ne
dommage to the tou^ / therefore they withdrewe them abak^ and purppsed to come
again to thassault. when their engyns should be better ordained: The barons took
counseyl among them for taduyse / how they might find manner to make engyns
for tassaylle the toun^ ffor them seemed that in all the country should not be
found trees ne wode yno we for to make such things as they should need. But
a valiant man of the country came forth and told to them of a valeye^ vj / or.

They sent theder great nombre of Carpenters And sum of the barons to
conduyte them / Each of them hew down the tres and did do bring them in

such thynge^ and did do make engyns perierers / Magonneauls. castellys

took none hyre ne wages if they had as much as they might entretiene and keep
them self / The other that were pour received their wages of the comyns / ffor

work sauf therle of toulouse. ffor he him self allone sustained of his propre
good all the werkemen without thaide of any other. and also to many knights
that had despe^ded their good did he give many great yeftes^ whiles that the
barons were thus besy that every che did do make his engyns for him self / The
other knights and the mean people ran unto busshes and hedges / ffor to fetch
stocks and rods with great dilygence for to make pynnes. None was idle. but

a great clerk and wise. of that other part made the sermon to the people. They
exhorted them by sweet words to enterprise vygorously the work of our lord /
wherein it were better to deye than to lyue^ The mount of Olyuete is against
Iherusalem in the eest^ party about a mile fer fro the town / ffor the vaal of
Iosaphat is between both. th^re assembled our lord his discyples and s^yed and
ascended up to fore them all in to heaven the day of thassension / and went up

crosses upon the walls / and in despyte of our savior. and in reproach of
our faith spytte on them and made other shames and foul things which be

serve him / saw well thise things that the turks made / their desire grew
and encreaced much in their ^ertes for tauenge the shame of our lord Ihesu

When the day approached that they had named for tassaylle the Cite / the night

normandye saw that this party of the Cite that they had assieged was much
well garnysshed of all manner of engyns. and the most defensable men of the
Cite they had set there. Therefore they doubted more this part^ than any other

endommage the town there. And enterprysed a thing of a right great affayre and
of much great trauaylle / ffro all thengynes that they had by them And the
castle to fore the sides were Joined to gydre^ they bar^ them alle^ On that
other side which is between the gate of seyn^ stephen and the tour of tha^gl^

cause that the cite had not be as^ieged on that side that there should be the
less defense / whereof it h^pped that they woke all the night as well the barons
as their p^pl^ in such wys^ that their engyns were all joined and raised up
by fore day or or the son aroos in the places where they ought to be The
castle was so approuched the wall / and was much hyer in so much that they
that were therein were almoost as hye as one of the toures / and know ye for

walls and towers. And merueylled what this might be that our men had so
trauaylled all the night / they saw that the lodgys of the Duc and of the
other barons about him were remeuyd. They sought them about that other side of
the town And found them there^ where as they had set no garden when they
saw thengyns and the castle dressyd / they merueylled over much. how they
might do this work in so lytil time. ffor this cause they doubted much the
more them that had thus enterprysed and accomplysshed so suddenly in the night
about that side of the town / the barons that were lodged as ye have herd to
fo^e / were not ydle^ but raised their engyns eueryche in his part / And
therle of toulouse had made tapproche the walls a castle that he had made with
much great trauaylle between the church of mount Syon and the Cite / the
other that were nygh^ the corner. which is called the tour of tancre.

town were ny^e all of one facion. ffor they were all square / the sides that
were toward the town were double / in such wise that one of the pan^s that was
without / might be aualed upon the walls. and then it should be like a
brydge^ But for all that the side was not unclosed ne discouerd^ But it was

that would have put forth the castellys might not do that they would: ffor there
was a dyc^ much deep to fore the barbycane. ffor which they might not make
their engyns join to the walls. the strokes of the stones of that were
thrown on the walls did not much harm to the walls of the cyte^ ffor the
turks had sackes full of heye^ and of coton^ And great pieces of tymbre bounden
with cables of ships which henge a long by the walls and towers / in such
wise that when the stones of thengyns smote these soft things / the strokes
were lost and made no hurt to the walls. On that other side the turks within

Among all other hye feetes that he did I shall recou^te to you one without
lesynge hit was so certainly that one of the highest barons of Allemayne a great
and strong knight / valiant and noble siewed the duc godeffroy which was his
cosyn. in plee in the court of the emperor of Almayne / to whom they were men
both two This man demanded of duc godefroy great part of his land that he
held in the duchye of Loreyne. And this baron said that it was his right and
apperteyned to him. So long went the plee forth by days and respytes. that
they of the court iuged that it should be determined by wagynge of the bataylle.
and named to them a day to fight for it. At the day named they came in to the
field Armed and apparaylled of that they ought to have / Then Bisshops and
good men labored much. And other Barons that were there payned them much for
to seek moyen and manner how the pees might be made / And shewde to them how
they were of one blood and lygnage. And that they ought to deporte them
tenterpryse thing of which must needs fall to one of them shame and
dishonour^ They payned them much one and other / but in no manner could they
find the peace to be made between them / Then began the bataylle between
these two barons much fires and sharp ffor they were both good and strong
knights. They smote to gydre right vygorously / This bataylle endured so long
that the valiant duc godeffroy smote that other so great a struck with his
sword that it flewe in pyeces / In such wise that there abode no more in his
hand thereof but half a foot long above the cross of the sword / The barons
that beheld the field saw how the duc had broke his sword and had the werse
and were much sorry and wroth thereof / And came to the emperor and they prayed him
swetly that he would suffer that they might comene of the peace between them / he
granted it gladly / The friends spak to gydre and acorded unto a peace. which
was ynowgh reasonable. But they left somewhat of the dukes right / when they
brought this acorde and pees to them / The Duc in no wise would here herof^ But
began the bataylle more cruel and fires than it was to fore / That other that
had his swerd hool. doubted ne^ fered not much the strokes of the duc which
had but a trouchon but ran upon the duc and oppressid him that he had no
leyzer to rest hym^ til the duc began to think and to take heart / Then he
dressyd him on his steroppes / And smote his aduersarye with the pommelle of
his sword that he held / upon the lyf^^ temple such a struck through the
helm. that he fyl down astonyed^ that it seemed that he was deed / ffor he
remeuyd no foot ne hand / Then the noble duc a light down and descended fro
his horse / and threw a way his trouchon of his swerde^ And took the sword fro
him that he had beten doun^ and mounted upon his horse again / Then called he
the barons / that had made and brought to him to fore the peace / and said to
them. ye lords such manner of peace as ye offered to me right now / is now to me
agreable^ and am ready now to take and abide / ffor though I have the dommage
and losse^ Alte lest I have no shame ne dishonor / And it plesyth me well. to
give and depart of my right^ to the end that I slay not this which is my
cosyn^ when the barons herd this. all they began to weep The peace was made
such as he said / he had more honor and ^oos / for the pees to which he
adressyd him so swetly than of all the prowesses that he had in this bataylle.
In which he did many

Of a fair feat of Arme^ that the duc did in a bataylle that the Emperor of
Almay^e had against them of Saxone Capitulo Clxxxxviijo.
aN other feat of prowess I shall recounte to you like as it happed without
lesynge. The people of Saxone^ which ben the most fell and most cruel of
all them of Almayne had desdayne and despyte tobeye to the emperor / And said
that they would do nothing for the emperor henry^ But said that they would have
a lord upon them self. which should obey to none other^ And made an hye noble
man of the country which was emonge them an Earl named Raoul for to be king
upon them by whom they would be Iustised and governed. when the emperor herd
this he was much wroth / and desired much to be avenged of so great oultrage.
Therefore sent he for all the barons of thempyre. and assembled much great
court / and made to be said and shewde in the presence of them all the pride
and rebellyon of them of Saxone^ whereof he demanded debonayrly counseyl and
their help. They acorded all that this thing was for to be avenged asprely
They habandouned body and power to the emperor for thamendynge of this
trespaas. They departed and each went in to his countre^ The Emperor somoned
his hooste as strongly as he might at a castle on the march of Saxone^ when
they were entered in to the land their enemies said that they would fight
against them. ffor they were proud and fires. in such wise that they set but
lytil by the power of the emperor / when they knew that they must fight / they
ordained their bataylles / ffor they had much people / And had ynowe / Then
demanded the emperor / of whom they were acorded that should bear thaygle /
which is the fawcon of thempyre / They choos to fore all other for to do
that. the valiant duc of Loreyne. worthy and most sufficiant to do it. They
reputed it for a much great worship that he was thus chosen by common acord of
them all / Nevertheless he with said it and refused as much as he might. But
he must needs take it on him / This day came / and that one party approuched
that other in such wise that they assembled fiersly / there were many men put
to death ffor they were merueillously wroth each against other whiles thus as the
bataylle was great and fyers in many places^ the duc Godeffroye that conduyted
the bataylle of The Emperor espied a great Rowte of men. wherein was this Raoul
which was lord of saxone / against them in the duc did do assemble the people
of the emperor. The duc knew this Raoul^ and smote the horse with his spores
against hym^ And with the gonfanon that he bare / Iusted against him in such
wise that he bare him through the body and slew him that he fylle down deed.
in the place. And Incontinent he redressyd and raised on heygthe his baner all
blody / his people saw that they had lost their lord and anon were disconfyted
/ Sum fledde^ and sum fylle down unto the feet of the emperor and put them
in his mercy / All the gentilmen and other gaf good hostages for tobeye ever
after to him and be at his commau^ment / Many other prowesses made the valiant
duc godeffroye / but it behooves not to put them all in this historye. ffor my
purpose now is for to recountre of the holy land by yonde the sea. and not of
them on this syde^ but of them of whom ye may understand that he was in his
country noble and a valiant knyght^ Of his largess against our lord I shall
say to you one thing. by which ye may understand the other In the duchye
of Loreyne was a castle which was most renommed and chyef of thonour of
buy^lon / And bare that name / when he should meue to goo (...) his pylgremage
by yonde the sea. he gaf this castle as the most noble and highest of his
heritage unto our lord in Alms in to the church of lyege for to abide
there for evermore

How the valiant duc godeffroy augmented the holy church And how he would
never bear crowne^ cao. Clxxxx^^
Sith that he had thus by election the Roya^m^ like as a devout and a
relygyous man as he was (...) louid much holy chirch and the seruise of our
lord by co^seyl of the bisshops and of other wise clerks that were in thoost /
he ordained first in the chirch^ of the sepulcre of our lord. and in the temple
clerks for to serue^ and establysshed chanonnes and gaf to them great rentes
and large herytages of which they should take their pre^endes^ and he would that
the chirches in thoo parties there should be ordained after the establementis /
uses. and custommes of the gre^e chirches of france / He began much hyly /
and well had accomplysshed if our lord had given to him longer life / He had
brought with him out of his country relygyous Monks. which said and song
their (...) and (...) al a long the way as he cam^ he gaf to them (...)
Abb^ye in the vale of Iosaphat^ and establysshed them ther^ And endowed them
there much Rychely with good rent^s and reuennes / And gaf to them great
pryueleges. he was a very relygyous and devout man^ And had his heart much
large unto holy chirche^ And gaf thereto many great things. when he was chosen
to be king / all the barons required him that he would do him be crowned and
receive thonour of the Royamme a^ hyly as the other kings in Cristendom do /
he answerde / that in this holy cite where our savior Ihesu Criste suffered
death and had born a crown of thorns upon his heed for him and for the sinners
/ he would never bear if it playsyd god crown of gold ne of precious stones.
but him seemed that it was ynowe of that coronacion that he had the day of his
passion for to honor all the kings Christian that should be after him in
Iherusalem / ffor this cause he refused the crown. There ben so^me men that
will not account him. among the kings of Iherusalem / but me thinks that
therefore he ought not to be lassed ne dymynued of his honor but the more and
hyer exalted and enhaunced. ffor he did not this for despysyng of the
sacrament of holy chirche^ but he did it for tesche we the bobaunce and pride
of the world. and for the great mekenes and humylyte that he had in his heart /
wherefore then I say not only that he was not king. but he was gretter than
any king that holds any Royamme sith that the holy land of Iherusalem was
conquered

Egypt which was the most puyssaunt and myghties^ of all the land of
thoryen^ had somoned all his power^ knights. gentilmen and all other that
might bear arms / in such wise that he had assembled a great hooste
merueyllously^ ffor he had great desdayne and despy^e of this that so lytil
people which were of a strange land and far ^ountr^y were so hardy and
durst come in to this land and Royamme. and had taken the cy^e which he had
^onquerd upon his enemies / he made come to fore him his con^stable which was
prince of his hoost^ he was named Elafdales. To this man he commanded that he
should take all this people with him and goo in to Surye / And run vygorously
upon this people that were so folyssh and oultrageous that had turned his peace
and made war to his people. Therefore he commanded him that he should efface and
destroy them all / In such wise that never word be spoken of them / This
Elafdales was of Ermenye born. And was called Cimireenx by another name. Of the
Christian men he was comen / But for the Richesse that was given him. and for the
lecherye that he fond emonge the mescreauntes / he renyed our lord and Christian
faith for to become sarasyn. This same man had conquered the Cite of Iherusalem
upon the turkes^ and set it in the puyssaunce of his lord the same yere^ that
the christian men had besieged it. And had not yet holden it ^xj / monethis^ when
thoost of the pylgryms took it upon them and rendered it to Cristiente / hit was
a thing that it much displaysyd his conestable that his lord had hold it so
short a while / And enjoyed no more his conqueste^ ffor this cause he
enterprysed in him this work / and for to renn^ upon our peple^ And him
thought it but a lytil thing and a light for to doo^ consyderyng the great
plente of people that he had for to disconfyte them that had taken the Cite. He
came in to Surye^ and brought with him all the power of Egypte^ he had great
pride in his heart by cause of the great people that he had / And was much
angry toward our men / But our lord that can fett^ well counseyl in all the
purpoos of men / ordained this work all in another manner than he devised / he
came with all his men to fore the Cite of Escalone. There they lodged them and
pourprised great space of ground. with them were joined all the dukes of
damask and they of arabe that were in thoo parties / much great p^ple /
Truth it is that to fore e^ our people entered in to the land / They of
Egypt and the turks of arabe louyd not to gydre / but doubted much
thencreacyng of the one and other / But after they accompanied them togydre to
come upon our men^ more for (...) of our people. than for love that they had
emonge them self. They were all to gydre to fore Escalone^ And they there
concluded to come after to fore Iherusalem for tassiege the town / ffor they
supposed verily. that our barons durst in no wise issue out against them in
bataylle

When these tidings were spradd through the cite of Iherusalem. All the people
were gretely affrayed great and small / By common acord of the bisshoppes they
came wull^n and barfote in the church of our lord. There were all the people.
and cried mercy to our lord with syghes and treris / And besought Ihesu
Criste much swetly that his people which he had kept and deffended unto that
day / he would deliver fro this peril ne suffer that the cite and holy places
that they late had rendered and yeuen to his name and to his seruyse and that he
would not that they should be remysed again and habandouned in ordure and fylthe
and in the desloyalte of the hethen men. ffro thens they went a procession
singing with much great pity unto the temple of our lord. There did the
bisshops and the clerks the seruyse / And the lay / people prayde with much
good heart and pytous / when this was don the bisshops gaf to them the
benediction / And after they departed The duc ordained barons and knights that
should keep the cyt^ After this he issued out and therle of fflaundres / And came
in to the playnes of Rames. The other Barons abode in Iherusalem / The
cytez^yns of napples had sent to fetch eustace brother of the duc and Tancre
for to come theder to them and they would yield to them the cyte^ They were
goon by the commandment of the duc and garnysshed much well the town with
people and vytaylle. of which the country was much fertile / therefore they abode
there and knew nothing of these tidings / But the duc sent for them And
they came hastily / and were with the other barons^ when the duc and the earl of
fflaundres arrived at Cite of Rames. they knew well the truth certainly
that this admiral was lodged to foreEscalone with so great people that the
contre was couerd Then sent they hastily messagers in to Iherusalem unto the
other barons which abode and awayted the certaynte of this thing / And he bad
them hastily to come alle^ sauf such as should keep the cite / And should bring

these beestes were comen men on horsbak which kept them from theuys. And
commanded to the herdmen what they should do. They that were sent forth by

The Emperor alexys which had seen them to fore received them with much fair

Royamme was fallen to this duc of normandye. but his brother which was younger
named Henry / came to the barons of the country and made them to understand /
tha^ the duc his brother was king of Iherusalem / And had no talente / ne
purposed never to return on this side the montaynes. By this lesynge they made
him king of England. and they becam his men^ when his brother returned fro the
holy londe^ he demanded of him his heritage entierly / And he would not deliver
it to him The duc made ready a great nauye / and gadryd as much people as he
might in normandye and other places. and passed the se^ / he arrived by force.
His brother that was king came ayens^ him with all the power of the land / The
bat^ylles were al ready for tassemble. But the noble and wysemen saw that it
should be over great hurt and damage if these two brethren should fight thus^
Therefore they spak of pe^s. and made it in this manner / that the said henry
should hold the Royamme / but he should give every year to his brother a greet
sum of good / of which he made him sure / And thus returned the duc agayn^
and came in to his land. after it happed that the king which had sum
castellys in normandye to fore that he had the Royamme of England / them would
he keep as his heritage / The duc demanded them And he would not delyue them /
then the duc assieged them. and took them by force^ when the king herd this /

his brother came against him / And they fought to gydre at tynche bray / there was

god / and honored of the world / he founded the chirches of this country
much rychely / he gaf to them great rentes / and endowed them with
Aournementes fair and of great valure^ Specially the church of Nazareth of
tabarye and that of mount Tabor^ he left them in hye estate and in much rich
point But the barons that after him have be lords of the country have taken
from them ynowgh of their tenours / This Tancre was wise and true / And
delyted him to do well to the chirches / as it appears after when he was
prince of Anthyoche^ ffor he enhaunced the church of saint peter and the
pryncipalyte and seygnorye of a^thyoche made he much te^crece and enlarged as

tHe customme of sum men is such / that they may not suffer the peace among

sourded a debate between the duc and the patriarch / ffor the patriarch
demanded of him the chyef tour of the town which is named the ^our^ dauyd.
and the fourth part of Iherusalem / above that he would have the cite of Iaphe

Hier recounteth thystorye how the fourth part of Iherusalem came unto the
patriarch of the same / cao. CCvijo.
Always it is certain. that fro the time that the latins entered in to the Cite.
And yet of more Auncyente / the patriarch of Iherusalem had the fourth part of
the cite of Iherusalem / And held it as his owen / how this happed and by what
reason / I shall say to you shortly / ffor the truth thereof has been serched^
It is founden by thauncyent historyes that whiles this Cite was in the hondes
of the hethen people / It might never have peace. that long endured^ But was
often assieged of hethen princes that were about it^ ffor each of them would
conquer it and put it in his seygnorye / Therefore they took often the proyes^
and mesdyde and trespaced to the Cytezeyns of the town / They brake the towers
and walls much oultrageously by their engyns. And for the oldenes of the.
walls / the Cite was disclosed and open in many places / In this time the
Royamme of Egypt was more rich and more puyssau^t of hauoyr and good and
defense than any other of the Royammes of Turkye / ffor the Calyphe held
then Iherusalem and the land therabout. and with his great host that he
sent theder he conquered all surye unto the Lyche which is by anthyoche Thus
had he encreced his empyre^ he establysshyd his bayllyes in the cytees that
stand on the sea side. And in them (...) the land / Then commanded he that
all should pay to him trybute and ordained and devised what he would have of
every cyte^ after this he would that the cytezeyns should make again the wallis
of eu^ Cite / And mayntene in good point the towers / and redress all about
such as neded / by the aduys of his men^ And after their establysshement / The
bailey of Iherusalem commanded to them of the town to repair their walls and
set them entierly in point like as they to fore had ben^ Then ordained he
and devised how much every street of the town should make^ By great cruelte and
malice he commanded that the caytyfs cristiens that were in the cite should
make the fourth part of the walls / They were so pour and so grieved of
tayllages and excises. that uneath they had among them all. whereof to repair
two to wrettys / They saw well that he sought occasion for to destroy them
all / Therefore they assembled^ and came much humbly to fore the bailey and fy^
at his feet. And much required in weping / that he would command them to do
thing that they might do. ffor this that h^ had commanded them to do was
ouermoche over their rewe^ / That Inhumayn baylly which was full of cruelte and
of pride bouyd not the Christian men and menaced them much f^e^sly / And swear
that if they accompl^sshyd not the commandment of this lord the Calyphe. he
would do smite of their heedes as tra^tours / when they herd this / they were
much aferd / and on that othersyde they saw well that they might not bear the
charge that he leyde on them / therefore they did so much at^e last by the
prayer of sum turks / which had pity on them that the Baylly gaf them
respyte. til that they had sent to the emperor of Constantynople and to require
him for the love of god that he would send his alms to perform this
horrible work. for to deliver them fro the peril of death in which they were
condemned if it were not by them made

Of the same matter / cao. CCvii^o
tHe messagers came fro them to themperou^ in to constantynople / they said to
him the troth of their message^ how they were in subjection. and what meseases
what fylthes the turks made them to suffer. And finally they must all deye
if he socoured them not / all they that herd them began to we^e for compassion
/ then was emperor a valyau^t man wise and of great courage named constantyn
and surname monamaques^ he governed much vygor^usly thempyre^ when he herd the
request of the pour ceisten men he was meuyd with great pity in his heart /
and said that he would help them gladly^ and should give to them so largely of
his good that the iiij part of the wallis which was comanded them to make
should be accomplysshyd^ but he promised them well that he should do nothing but
by couenaunt^ That is to wete that if they might pourchace of the lord of the
land. that within the party of the cite that should he closed with his money^
none should dwell but christian. me^ / on this condition would he do it / and
other wise not^ In this form he delyuerd to them his lettres patentes. And
sent to his bailey of Cypre / that if the christian men of Iherusalem might
pourchace of the Calyphe of Egypt this that ye have herd. that of the rent
that he ought to have in that londe^ he should let make the fourth part of the
wallys of this holy Cite The messagers that had thus don their message.
Returned unto the Patriarke^ and to them that had sent them / And recounted to
them truly how they had don and sped / They answered that it should be hard to be
had. not withstondyng they must essaye^ ffor they might pass in none other
manner. they sent good messagers and true to this great lord the Calyphe of
Egypt / Our lord help him in such wise that they fo^de in him this that they
sought and shortly to say / he delyuerd to them a good chartre sealid with his
seal. and confermed with his propre hand that so closyng the / iiij / part / he
granted to them the fourth part of Iherusalem^ The messagers retorned^ They
that had sent them made to them great joy when they knew how they had
achyeued their message. The bailyes of Cypre passed. in to Surye / And they
made the fourth part of the walls. with the goods of the emperor like as he
had commaunded^ And this work was made in the year of thyncarcion of our lord
^M^lxiij. then was calyphe and king of egypt bommensor / And this was /
xxxvj^ year to fore the cite was conquered. unto this time the christian men were
lodged in the town emonge the turks comynly one by another^ but fro thens
forth that the Calyphe had commanded. the fourth part of the town was delyuerd
to them / Then were the christian men much eased. ffor when they dwelled among
the turkes^ they that were their neighbors / did to them great ennoyes and
shames / But when they were by them self / they did them not so much / if
they had any debate emonge them self it was brought to fore the patriark. ffor
fro then^e forth was in that part of the town none other justice but he / thus
gouned he it as his oune. his iiij part is bou^ded as I shall say to you^ ffro

towns of the turks / cao CCixo.
iN this time after that all the Barons that were come in pylgremage were
departed fro the land and returned in to their countrees / The valiant duc to

almost allone in tho partes^ they were much pour of good and of men. uneath
might they make when they did all their power three honderd men on horsbak^
and two thousand a foot / The Cyttes that the pylgryms had conquered were far
a sondre / And none might come to other without great peril of their enemies /
The vyllages that were about the cytees which were called casians therein
dwelled the turks that were their subgettis and obeyed to the lords of the
cytees / but thise turk^s hated nome^ more. ^han they did the christian men. and
pourchaced incessantly all the harm and evil that they might. when they fond
any of our men allone out of the way / gladly they murdered them And sometime
they led to the Cytees of the sarasyns for to selle them / yet thought they
of gretter meschyef and folly / ffor they would not ere ne labor their lands
to the^de that the lords and men of the cytees should not take their rentes /
and desired them self liver to suffer mesease / rather than our people should
have any good of auaylle The Christian men were not well assured within the
Cytees / ffor they had but few people / And there came theuys by night that
Robbed their houses. and slew them in their beds / And bare away all their
thynges^ By this occasion many there were of the Christian men / that left their
fair tenementes and howses in the Cytees and returned pryuely in to their
countries / ffor they had great dread / that the Turkes^ which that dwelled

The host of the Christian men that were without / were but few and suffretous

unto the valiant duc godeffroy^ presents of brede^ of wyn of dates and of

How buymont was taken in going to Meletene / which cite the lord of the same
would yield to him cao. CCxjo.
iN the Royamme of Iherusalem they contained them thus as ye have herd. Then
it happened that a rich man of e^menye named Gabryel was lord of the cite of
meletene. which stondeth by yonde the River of Eufrates in the land of
meso^^tayne^ This gabriel doubted much that the turks of Perse should ^ome on
him / ffor the men that they held / ran often on him / in such wise that he
might not well suffer it / Therefore he took counseyl. And sent messag^^^ to
buymont prince of Anthyoche / that that should say to (...) name. that he should

couenauntes (...) which he sent to hym^ he lo^yd buymont / And (...) that he

went forth on his way / he passed the River of Euf^a^^s and entered in to
mesopotayne / And was nyghe the Cite of meletene / ffor which he went for to
receive / when a puyssaunt amyral of the turks named domsmayn / that had
certainly the ^^ry knowleche of his coming. And lay in awayte for him / and
ran upon him sodenly^ and his men being all out of arraye and dispourueyed /
They that abode were all slain / ffor there were over great plente of turks /
The other fled Buymont was taken and reteyned^ and they ladde him the hands
bounden with cords / And his feet chayned with iron / Of this adventure mounted
the turk in great pride / And ^rusted much in his host that he led / that
he came to fore the cite of meletene. and assieged it. by cause he supposed that
they would have delyuerd it without taryeng / But sum of them that escaped fro
thens where the prince was taken came fleyng in to the cite of Rages. They told
to therle Bawdwyn this great mesauenture that was fallen to them / when the
valiant Earl herd this / he was much angrye^ And had great pity of the prince
/ whom he held for brother for the company of the pylgremage. And by cause
they had their countrees so nygh to gydre It should have displesyd him if the
turks should conquer this cite that buymont should have had^ Therefore he somoned
hastily all his men that he might have on horsbak and a fote^ and took with
him that was necessary for such a vyage and went toward thoo partyes^ well a
three day iourneye was Rages fro meletene^ he had sone passed this way in
suchewyse that he was nyghe the cyte^ But the said donysmayn knew well the
coming of therle and durst not abide ne fight with him. But left the siege and
departed and led forth. with him buymont fast bounden and straytly when
Bawdwyn herd that he durst not abide him / but fled to fore him / he ran
after with his men and chaced him three days long / when he saw that he might
not overtake him / he returned in to the cite of Meletene. Gabryel the lord of

gOdeffroy the valiant Duc and his men that were left with him for to keep
the Royamme began to have much great mesease / and suffer such pouerte that
uneath it may be devised. Then it happed that good espyes and true brought
to him tidings that in the parties of arabye on that other side of from Jordan
were much rich people which doubted nothing. And therefore they dwelled out
of fortresses^ if they were surprised there should be much great gain won /
The valiant Duc that so much had suffered took with him people a foot and on
horsbak as many as he might sauf the guard of the Cite. Then entered he
suddenly in to the land of his enemies. There gadred be many great proyes^
that is to wete^ horses / beufes. ^yen and sheep And rich prysonners brought
he great plente. Then returned he toward Iherusalem / Sum turks there were
hye and purssaunt of them of Arabye which were much hardy^ and noble in
Armes^ And had great prys^ Emonge all other there was one that had long desired
for to see the duc Godeffroye of boloyne / and would fayn know if it were true
that was said of his force and stre^gthe / and acqueynte him with his people of
ffraunce of whom he had herd so much / that were come fro the occident unto
th^^yent / And had conquered so many lands And set them in their subjection.
Above all other he desired to see duc godeffroy and know if it were troth
that was said of his prowess and his strength / he did so much to such me^
as he spak^ that he had good sure^^ and try ws to come unto the duc^ he
salewed him much low enclynyng like as is their customme. And after he prayed
and desired of the duc much humbly / that it would plese him to smite with his
swerd a Camel that he had brought much grete^ ffor as he said it should be
great honor to him in his country / if he might recounte any of his strokes
that he had seen him self. The duc knew well that he was come fro for to see
him / And did that he required him. he drew his swerd / and smote the camel
on the neck where it was grettest^ And smote it of as lightly as it had been a
sheep^ when the turk saw this / he merueylled over much. In such wise that
he was all abashed / when he had a litil he thought him / he said in his
langage. I see well said he that the duc has a good swerd and well trenchant and
cuttyng / But I wot never if he could smite so great a struck with another
swerde^ The valiant duc demanded what he said. And when he knewe^ he began
to smyle a lytil / And after said. that he should deliver to him his owen
sword. The turk did so^ the duc then smote therewith an other Camel^ In
such wise that he made the head to flee of much lyghtlyer than of the other /
then merueylled over much the turk And said that it was more by the
strength of the Arme^ than by the bounte of the swerd^ he had well preuyd^ that
it was true that was said of the Duc in his Countreye^ Then he gaf to the
duc many fair Iewellys of gold and of rich stones and much acqueynted with
hym^ And after returned home in to his countre^ The valiant duc came unto
Iherusalem with all his proye / and the trusses and fardellys of his gayn
which were so great that all the men of his company were rich: In that month
of Iuyll^ the velyaunt duc godefroy which was governor of the Royamme of
Iherusalem had a maladye and sekenes much great / All the phisiciens of the
contre were sent for^ They did all that in them was possible / But all
auaylled not^ ffor the pain encresyd always more^ After this he sent for men
of relygyon as prelates curates and other good and devout men for to have
counsel of them for the health of his soul / he was much well confessyd and
very repentaunt with great wepynges / And in his right mind with great
devotion departed out of this world / Certainly we ought to think that the
soul was brought up with angelis to fore the face of Ihesu crist. he deyde
the.xiij day of Iuyll the year of thyncaruacion of our lord M / j / C / he
was entiered and buried in the church of the holy sepulcre under the place of
