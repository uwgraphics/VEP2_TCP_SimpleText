How Morindos a King of Spain married with Miracola a Witch: and how he was
transformed without shape for polluting the Temple of God.

CHAP. I
WHen Spain was nursed with the milk of paganism, virtue not known; nor God
honored, there lived a people so ripe in sin, that the keen edge of shames
sickle, lay even ready whetted to reap them down for confusions harvest: yet
the subjects then living where not so wicked as the King vicious: a King we
name him, (if illustrious title of majesty, may grace so pernicious a foe to
nature with so royal a style) his birth was fatal, for when the midwife
pulled him from the cradle of his conception, the earthquake, and heaven rained
blood: his parents ominous, the one devoured by wolves, the other burnt to
death by thunder: his youth full unlucky chances, his age tirannous and
mischievous, and all his life subject to black misdeedes. When his parets by
heavens wrath had ended thus their, dates, he reigned King, and wore the
imperial Diadem, but such a King, good men thought never sprung from woman's
womb. Morindos for so we name him, being seated upon the throane of majesty,
ruled not in love but by force, making his nobles flaues to his sin, and
their wives, feeders of his lust: for every day in the year he had a several
concubine, all young, beawtifull, and lovely: nature framed their bodies fair,
though sin made their souls black: for both art and riches endeavored to
delight his insatiate desires: earths chiefest pleasures were at his command:
and all the lullabies of content, rockt him in the cradle of security: thus
careless of heavens wrath, he more honored the Devil, then he loved God: and
what was the vilest to nature, he most doted upon. But now after al these
pleasures of his wanton youth, the kind embraces of his fair concubines, which
like earthly Angels made him happy in natures sports, he wickedly fell
inamored upon one of the Devils black saints, one Madam Miracola, a Witch of
damnation, now burning in heli for her black deeds: this Madam Miracola borne
of noble parentage, brought up in the deepest arts, skillful in Magic
charms, and incantations, who having spent seven years in that deep mystery
of coniuration, sildome sleeping without the sosciety of spirrits, fayries,
goblins, or nigtly shapes: her chiefest study and aim was at principallitie,
to rule sole Queens and governor of the Kingdom, and no way was there to
attain to that imperial seat, but by marying with king Morindos, though not a
match fit, he being descended royally, she but nobly: yet by sorceries,
witchcrafts, and magic devises, she obtained her purpose, and in this manner
obtained it.

Upon a time when King Morindos, in the height of his reuelles, whilst some of
his fairest concubines, daunced before him naked in their cambrick smockes: the
more to inkindle lusts fire, she entered the chamber of their licentious
sports, with a mask of wonder, the like never seen in Princes court: for all
the Maskers (except her self) were infernal spirrits, vissible, but not
tangable, all in the shape of young Ladis, attired in more changeable silks
then the colors of the Rainebowe: her self in a robe of such richnes, as it
seemed to exceed the glory of the sun for brightness: her own body she
imbathed and supled with a water of such enchantment, that what man soever
first set eye upon her, either present love or present death, had destiny
allotted him: for well knew she that no man presumed his presence, during this
time of pleasure.

This Madam Miracola, asisted by the black states of hell, by delusions won
the kings love: whose unconstant eyes, no sooner firt their inflecting beams
on this killing cokatrice: but all on a sudden fire his love inflamed yt
nothing could quench it, but her love joined to his, which were imediately
sealed together: love, desire, and lust, so conspired against his bewitched
heart, that he presently avoided the chamber of his intifing damsels, and she
of her deluding spirits: remaining then but two bodies, two hearts, and two
tongues, he began to reveal loves secrecy in this manner: Madam quoth he
(knowing her to be a long attender in his court) good or evil fortune has
enchanted me, and now thy present love or hate, must either glorify me with
earthly happiness, or send me wandering to the dark some walks of death, where
no soscietie but crawling worms and dead men's benes are resident: deny me not
therefore good Madam, I am this countries Potentate, I can command both
wealths and power, cities, towers, and towns: Statesmen stoop, and humly
kneel unto my soote: royalties, dignitles, and al other kingly promotions, are
at my disposing: unto my pleasurs all the land submits: delights are my
vassels, both land, and sea as subjects strive to make me happy: I am an
earthly God, be thou my Goddess, take all these honors, I will attend on
thee, I Will be thy subject, thy servant, I will kiss thy foot: deny not my
love for thou have bewitched my heart, inchaunted me, fired me with a
quenchlesse flame, all my boddie burns and nothing but the sweet Dew of the
grant can quallifie it: make me either unfortunate or happy sweet Madame.
This being breathed from his longing soul, she far more tractable to loves
motions then he, made a full conclusion of a willing acceptance in this fort: I
have a mind imperious monarche (said she) soaring up to the batlements of
heaven, no bace desires nor lowebred thought, shall any whit aspire my princely
will: I aim at a kingly bed, where maisstie sleeps, whose chamber is
imperious, guarded with commanding statesmen: seven weary winters, and as many
summers have my hopes been climing up this kingly ladder, and now on the top of
fortunes wheel am I fallen into a princes bosom: in loving me (great King)
thou conquerest fate, thou subiectest hell, thou may (by my assistance)
command legions of the black host to houer over thy Palace, and in the
twinkling of an eye, blast up all thy wicked consperators: if our minds but
once prove equal in the cheer of soueraingty, the earth shall be far too
little for thy government: my magic charms shall vnbowell the earth, rip up
her bosom, ransack her rich treasures for thy use: my magic charms for
thee, and for thy pleasure shall empty the vast Drean and cram thy kingdom
with those riches that man's eye has not seen since the worlds creation: my
charms for thy content shall paue thy Court with pearls, emrodes and
Diamonds: command great king, and the marble stones that now compase thy
palace shall dance, and the air like singing Cherubins sound us heavenly
hermony: contents delights, pleasures, joys, and all the solaces of heaven and
earth, shall be thy attendants by inuesting me thy equal in great majesty:
thus, and in this manner did she clime the supremacy, and tied upon her back
the title of a Queeue. Being both enchanted thus, and entangled in the snares
of desire, they imediately tied Himens knot, aband that none sunders but death:
the marriage they solemnized the same night, not able to stay the mornings rise,
but as black thoughts have black events, so in black manner was this marriage
celibrated, it was even at the middle of night, when the Scritch-owle, Kockes,
and Doremice, sleep in foggy mistes: it was even at that hour when the
ghoastes of dead men walk, when murderers dream of villainy, even when ye
earth had her fable garments on, was this sacred knot united, both being
impatient of delay, he burning in lust, she aspiring a kingdom, converted the
holy temple to a marriage bed: be ever black this deed of hell, and never be it
sold but with a trembling tongue, for never was night more dark then this:
the fable curtines of the air were all as pitch, and seemd so hide this
poluted sin: the earth cast up such a misty vapor, that extingguished both
fire and cressetlights: art could not make one candles flame, nor any mean of
brightness to behold each other: so wicked was this enterprise of theirs,
that both heaven and earth showed fatal prodegies, and every thing (that
dismal night) grew different from nature: nothing was heard but bowling
Dogs, croaking Loades, and hissing snakes, unknown voices bellowed in the
court, and the polluted Temple so vilely stained, was compassed about with
ghastly spirits, Fire-drakes and walking Goblins. But mark now the strangest of
al wonders, even at the very instant when the seed of procreation conjoined;
even as it were a cry of mandrakes struck the King into a madness, blaspheming
heaven till his tongue grew dumb, his eyes blind, his ears dease, his
joints numbe, and all his body shapelesse. And as a Bear new whelpt like a
lamp of flesh without fashion, lay clasped in the arms of this new made
Queen. But now when the morning came, and that the light of heaven sommond all
creatures from sleep, the Nobles of his court came to his bed, five, thinking
to give them both a joyful good morrow, but even as their lips gave way to
their tongues passage, their eyes espied this fearful accident: a judgment
that heaven has sildome yet shown, which was a king, deaf, dumb, blind and
senceles, by breathing life: which strange fight stroke the nobles into such a
maze, that without any further speech they forsook the court, confidently
thinking it unhappy, in harboring so vile a monster as this king was. Now this
new made Queen or damned inchantresse, having purchased a kingdom by
hirblacke proceedings, was so blinded with the greatness of majesty, and so
ravished with the brightness of a crown, being now sole Queen and governor
thereof, made a careless sport of gods indgment, and having in her court none
left but parasites, and flatterers, such as are commonly the right hands to
principalities, made the greatest sinners the most honorable, and held the
vicious in best regard: the deformed shape of the king having life but no
senses, she caused to be put in a brazen coffen, and fed him daily with humane
blood, which she poured into his mouth through quilles of filuer: the success
hereof you shall hear in the next chapter, and what a strange conception she
had after this first night of her marriage.

Here the enchanted Queen made the Devils a banquet with her husbands body:
her three questions to the same Devils, and their answers, and of her
dispairing lamentations in a dark dungeon.

Chap. 2.
SDone blasted were the hopes of this aspiring Queen, and scowling mischance
with a bended brow, hemd in their mariadge bed: heavens wrath and hells fury,
laid heavy burdens upon them, and as it were, broke their heart strings
asunder: for Miracola, after she had coffend her deformed husband, yet
breathing life, melancholy despair and pining grief chiefly atended upon
her: discontent, suspicion, and fear were her gardiants by day, and by night:
strange visions, doleful outcries and unquiet dreams assailed her: wild
beasts straide from the woods and in same manner made them dens within her
court: unlucky birds forsook the air to sit vippon her palace, such as
nightowles and crooking ravens be, sounding forth fatal and harsh harmony: the
sun seemd to shine upon her with a scowling face, the moon as a shamd of her
soulesda^nation (in conferring thus with devils) as it were drew back behind
the pitchy clouds, and unwillingly lent light unto the meaner stars: each
thing grew contrary to kind, only her self excepted, for she having made an
atonement with the princes of the fiery world, put her whole confidence in
them, and only trusted through their asistance, to lead Fortune in a string
and at her pleasure command kingdoms. So upon an evening, when the days
bright eye had left heavens sater palace, and night with her black canopie,
had compast in the earth, she betook her to her private chamber, where Medea
like, she raised up her old servants, the furies or rather the spirrits of
darkness, from their burning beds, such as condemned souls lie flaming upon,
who no sooner presented themselves before her, but she questioned them in this
manner: I charge you (quoth she) you enemies to heaven and man, by the band and
condition made betwixt you and me sealed with my dearest blood, and by the
seven sucking babes that I once offered to you at midnight, and by the hope you
have of my soulos purchase at my deaths fatal hour, answer me truly to three
several questions which here I will presently propound unto you: first how
long my life shall continue, secondly whether I shall die a Queen or not:
lastly the number of my children and their following fortunes: to which
proposttions, these instruments of mischief imediately condiscended to
answer, but upon this strange condition following: that as a toe to these
black barrasters, she should deliver up her husbands deformed body, and serve
it to them in seven several banquets, that both his flesh and blood, as a
bribe to hell might be made food for spirrits: which demand to this woman
monster, seemed but an easierequest, and therefore like to the viper, which
feeds upon her own dam, gave that life and body to the tyrany of hell, which
ought to have been precious in the ese of heaven, and the dearest jewel of her
own heart: These diligent deceivers having no sooner promise of this purchased
prize, but in a misticali sort, or riddle like, gave answers to her three
former questions, in this sort: First, for the continuance of her life, they
said she should live til the seven days of the week were forgotten: the
second question was, whether she should dye a queen or not, they answered that
neither heaven nor earth, God nor man, should take her kingdom from her: the
third and last question was, to know the number of her children and their
following fortunes, to this they answered, that from her boodie should spring
seven branches, whose tops should reach to heaven: These answers to this
accursed woman's ears, came more joyful, then the reports of pardon to a
condemned man, and more pleasing to her heart then for a moorish slave from the
cheaned gaily to be aduan'st unto a kingdom: therefore with a setied trust and
assurauce of the spanish crown and government (little mistrusting the fly
defeates of these mystical answers) with all convenient speed provided a
chamber, wherein she might perform her damned condition, and deliver up her
husbands body to the gluttony of hell: therefore ascending to the top of her
palace, into a marble tower, she caused her husbands body to be bronght
thither, and after commanded the walls to be hung round about with black
mourning cloth, to signify her damned and fatal enterprise: this being done,
she purposed to divide the service of her seven bauquets into seven several
days, and in this manner were they accomplished: the first day upon a table
of black Ebony, in two pron plates or platters, she set the two legs of her
unhappy husband, which so often (in his good days of fortune) bestride the
warlike palfrey in the honor of his country: the second day upon the same
Ebony table, she placed his fine wd thighs (in two vessels of lead) whose blew
veignes, signified the force and strength of manhood: the third day the
likewise brought to the table his secret parts and bowels, in a vessel of tin
or pewter, wherein lay the seed of procreation: the fourth day she furnished
the same table, in a charger of brass, with the belly and inward parts of his
body, which had so often been cherisht with delicious and princely banquets:
the fifth day in like manner in a vessel of compounded mettle named alchemye,
she brought to the table his manly breast, which as a tower had many years
closed up his heart: the sixth day in a platier of fine silver, she served in ye
two arms of her husband, which whilst virtue gouernd, held both thescepter of
peace and the sword of war: the seventh and last, day in a vessel of pure
gould, being the dearest and richest service, she brought in his head, which
had so often been ornafied with an imperial diadem, centaining a tongue that
could in former times, have given thee life or death: all these unnatural
seruises by the hands of a woluish natured woman. Being no sooner finished, the
fatal table auosded, but both heaven and earth, land and sea, as it were gave
echoes of terror: hell it self seemed to tremble, and spewed up corrupted
sauors, and from her fiery furnaces, cast abroad such sparckling flames, ye
even the imbrodered vestures beset with goldsmiths workmanship, so gorgeously
beautifing her body, were fiered, and she golden traniels of her hair, burnd
from her head: notwithstanding all this nothing amazed the shameless mind of
Miracola, nor any way affrighted her with the teror of heavens wrath, for ye
thirst of promotio^ so bewitched her, ambitious pride so enchanted her, and the
desire of a diadem so imboldned her, that thinking both crown and kingdom her
asurance for ever, by ye false promises of hell: imediately upon this same tower
or chamber where she had thus sacrificed her husbands body, she caused certain
characters or letters to be engraven upon the marble walls, concerning her
perpetual happiness: The first superscription was to this effect following.
Upon this earth Miracola shalliue, till the seven days of the week be
forgotten: which she thought was forever.

The second superscription was: That neither heaven nor earth, God nor man
should take her kingdom from her.

The third: That her children like seven branches should reach to heaven.

These three promises she regarded as Oracles, and believed that through them
her earthly happiness should never end: but suddenly this violent joy, turned
into an extreme grief, for as she stood contemplating of these neuer-ceasing
delights, there entered invisibly into the chamber, one of the blackepotentates
of hell, and under every one of these superscriptions, ingraued these
significations: Under the first this: The seven days of the week, be thy
seven daughters now breeding in thy womb, who no sooner ripe but rotten, no
sooner borne but forgoten.

Under the second: Though neither heaven nor earth, God nor man, will take the
kingdom from thee, yet hell and the devil shall.

Under the third: The seven branches whose tops should reach to heaven, be
the seven deadly sins that shall spring from thy womb, whose bloody
enterprises and black deeds, shall clime heaven for an eternal Judgment.

These dismal and ominous revelations, were no sooner ceazed upon, by the
eyes of this accursed Queen, but all the parts of her body trembled with
fear: not a member but the terror thereof distempered: now fear of Gods
vengeance by little and little entered into her heart, and the quiuering thought
of hells damnation filld her bosom full of despair: without all hope of
salvation, she enclosed herself in the centorie of the earth, in a cause where
neither light of sun, nor the glimmering brightness of the moon might
descend, nor any voice of man or other creature could yield her comfort: thus
excluding her self from all worldly solaces, committing the government of her
kongdome to Scicophants and careless guiders, she wasted away the time of ten
months, in this dark and solitary dungeon, both day and night, making these
or such like wofell lamentations: Oh Nature (quoth she) thou nurse of every
living thing, why did it not thou end me in my first beginning? why did my
mothers womb, bring to light this my damned soul? why did my cradle rock this
my body of perdition, to so many lullabies? I wish my nurses pappe had peelded
naught but venomed poison, and that my swathing clothes, had been sheets of
boiling lead, that both life and body at one instant had been both consumed:
but woe is me, I am resecued for an eternal torment: my tongue bath consented
to my souls everlasting damnation, and my hand sealed to to a band that can
never be canceled, till I becast into hels deuowring bowels: fall upon me thou
great frame of heaven and cover me: thunderclaps descend, whirle winds arise,
and cast me beyond the bounds of man's imaginations: thou spirit of red
vengeance, transform me to some venomous worm: make me without soul, or
feeling, that my torments be not everlasting: woe upon woe pursues me, for the
gayning of a crown and kingdom, have I sold and forever lost my dear soul,
whom all the treasures both of earth and sea, nor the prasers of good men can
evermore redeem, cursed be mine eyes that traind me to this damned studdy: band
be my tongue that pradisd first these incantations: and woe to all my wits and
senses, that so cursedly gave over themselves, to these magic charms now rane
and rage, be you mad, distraught and lunaticke: dig up the bowelles of the
earth, and wander far beyond the Antipodes: but ob for ever weep, weep thou
most miserable soul, howl and lament that grief may split asunder thy sad
heart, for such a woeful heart never lined in woman's breast: thus and in this
manner spent she in deep lamentations, both minutes, hours, weeks and
months, fill her womb grew big, and the fruit therein ripe and ready to fall.

How the enchanted Queen was delivered of feawen daughters at one time: and
how she lay in child bed one and twenty years after.

Chap. 3.
NOw betwirt her prodegious and unlucky marriage, ten times had the silver moon
renewd her brightness, and the time of her delivery drew near unto the
appointed hour: when in great torments both of soul and body, she ascended
from her dark habitation, where, for forty weeks, her rhiefest food was
sorrow, grief and care: but now like unto the owl ashamed of the light, she
came abroad, and caused provision to be made fitting for her delivery: and
although her Ladies inwardly hated her life and conversation, yet in charity
and christian love, they attended her safety, being conducted to her chamber,
where the painful hour of chlide bearing were to be inbured: the pinching
throes so tortured her womb (bearing so strange a burden) that she in verry
grief and agony thereof, with her natles tore out her own eyes, and wonld
have rent the fruit alive out of her womb, had not the tender care of her
Ladies prevented her: Thus sightles and comfortless fell she in labor, wherein
she centinued in great extreamltle for the space of seven days, making such
bitter moan, and breathing from her painful heart such doleful groans, as
would have forced even merciles Tigers to pity: and so strange was her
daliuerie, that the report thereof might fill large volumes with bitter
lamentations: for in seven days she brought forth seven maiden children,
every one as hateful to the world, as the seven deadly sines: all at one
birth, a thing sildom seen, but that God in instice will show his iuogement,
upon so inhumane a woman.

The first was borne upon the sunday, which we compare unto pride, as the
course of verlise hereafter shall because, which child was called Sola, after
the dates name.

The second upon the monday, which we liken unto envy, according to her lives
quallitie, and bore the name of Lucina.

The third upon tuesday, which we alude unto wrath, and therefore named Martia.

The fourth upon wednesday supposd to be covetousness, which we call Mercuria.

The fist upon thursday, which we imagine to be dronhennes, and therefore we
name her Iouina.

The fixed upon friday, which we place for letchery, and give her the name of
Venorina.

The seventh and last of this ominous brood, was borne upon the saturday,
which weterme to be sloth, and so call her Saturnia.

Thus was the seed of shame brought into the world, at whose birthes seven
black ravens, set croaking directly upon the top of her chamber, and the
howlets of mischaunce, with fatal wings flustered against the crystal
windows: each one of them borne with teeth in their mouths, whereat the
midwife and other her asistants (the Ladies there present) were much amazed,
and with trembling hearts seared to behold so strange a spectacle of nature:
but as fate and destinye had allotted, they of their own fres wills, prouived
for these seven monsters (thus borne) seven several nurses, the wives of
seanen shepheares, which anely had their habitations, in woddig die caves,
where they were diligently brought up and not once suffered till their full age
to come within the Court gates, where we will leave them to fortunes direction
for a time: The woeful mother of these unfortunate children, being now safely
delivered, (through her own extreme violence, lying sightlesse in her
childbed, the only foe to worldly delights) in the hearing of many standers
by, breathed forth this pitiful complaint: oh how happy is the silly worm
(said she) that has neither soul nor understanding, whereby the threatening
of everlasting torments may not affright it the miseries of this world wherein
I now deservedly lie, are but as delights and sports in regard of them I shall
feel! when the doomes day of my life is past. I lie now as it were upon a
bed of pricking thorns, and stung with a thousand serpentine stings: but woe
is me, my guilty conscience doubts, that for my wilful loosing of my soul. I
shall lie boiling in the red hot chaldron of damnation, more thousands of
years; then blades of grass grow upon the earth, leaves upon trees, or
stars in ye crystal firmament: and more, which terrifies my condemned
soul, I shall ye there in consuming pain, (but never consumed) more millions
of years then as if a heap of sand should lie on earth, whose top should
reach to heaven, and once in every million of years an eagle should fetch away
but one sand, yet would those years of torments have an end, but mine can
never finish, for selling that sweet soul that my dear saviors life was
shed for: me thinks I hear seven sucking babes knocking at heaven gates for
vengeance against me, for giving up their tender bodies as a food for
spirrits: me thinks I hear seven virgins (all the daughters of mighty
Potentates) accusing me for enchanting them, to a heap of senceles stones: me
thinks I hear seven aged men, whose heads were beawtified with milk white
pledges of wisdom, all coming as witnesses against me, for sucking way their
blood by spirrits, in the likeness of aspes and adders, and after sacrificing
the marrow of their bones, to the chief Prince of darkness, for which my
conscience now tells me, ye heavens iron hand of vengeance in even ready to
strike, and that hells wrath is inuenting now tortures for my soul: and now
there is a horred voice thunders in mine ear, that this my ever stained crime
shall be also scourged in my seed, and all my kindred washed from the face of
the earth, into the unknown vault of forgetfulness: and now in speaking these
words, all her ioints grew lame and numbe, thereby to join in equal misery
with her sightles eyes: where we will leave her now, as the picture of
calanutie, lying in childbed, for the space of one and twenty years, and
speak of her childrens misfortunes, whose lives were as ovious to the world,
as the seven deadly sins.

Prides Tragedy,

The life and death of Sola the proud, the first daughter to the enchanted
Queen: a history full of dole, woe, and calamity.

CHAP. 4
THeeldest and first child of this viperous Queen, borne upon a sunday,
hearing the name of Sola, and being the true picture of pride, in life and
nature perseuering in that deadly sin, for being no sooner grown to the
ripeness of age, and that the years of discreation had grafted her with
understanding she was by the nobles and ladies of the Land, brought to the
court, in hope that after her mothers decease (by the decree of frowning
chance, lying then in marnelous calamities she would prove a gracious and
good queen, but it happened far otherwise, for being now on the way of
preferment, and cluning up the steps of imperial dignity, a kind of
commanding pride so bewitched her, that she esteemd her self above woman's
kind, and that nature had framd her of no earthly substance, but rather of the
pure mould of celestial angels: her crimson colored cheeks whereon the glory
of beauty seemd to shine her iuory front or forehead where art and nature
strove for supremasie: and her bright twinkling eyes, within whose pretty
balls, the God of love seemd to show himself, were al in her proved
imaginations too precious for the sun to shine upon, and her self, with all
other parts of her body, the most pure workmanship of natures experience, she
held too angel like, to tread upon the gross earth: therefore she, (the more to
advance her great pride) caused a chariot of crystal glass to be made, close
framed on al sides to keep both winters blastes and summers heat from her
delicate body: the which chariot by skillful art was wasted up and down, by
artificial means devised man's invention: her food was the purest restoroties
of the earth, both of beasts, birds, fowls and fishes, and the only
quintisence of nourishments to maintain life: her pleasures were the music
and singing voices of young virgins, the daughters of noble men and knights:
her garments were of the finest Medean silks, weau'd upon silver loomes by
Arabian queens: Thus pomp and pride eleuating her mind, as it were beyond the
ambition of Lucifer, who sought to pull God out of heaven and esteemd no man of
that royal birth, worthy to match with her in miriage: Emperors and kings she
accounted but as slaves to fortune, and the only subie as to variable chance:
many high personages enterprizd the conquest of her love, but reaped the
fruits of denial and disgrace, and were not suffered that asuming savor, as
once to kiss her proud hand: yet al last three bold aduenturous gallants,
hearing her thu^dring fame rumord about the world, attempted to purchase the
conquest of this prize, that neither Emperors nor kings could obtain:

The first was a Soldier, whose valor and matchles thinarie, upon the wings of
fame was carried by and down the earth, as far as ever the golden eye of heaven
has shown his glistering brightness.

The second was a Scholar, whose Academick skill in all the seven liberal
sciences, might challenge in all princes courts, the honors of the golden
tongue.

The third and last was a merchant, whose trauelles by sea, round about the
earth, compassing seven times the equinoctial line, purchased such wealth, as
builded one of the greatest cities in the world: These three (times honored
champions) coming before this proud Lady of the earth, who sitting then like
a goddess, upon the tribunal seat of majesty, began their loves embassage,
in this manner.

Divine Sola (said the Soldier) thou miracle of woman kind, at whose birth
good fortune daunced, this body of mine is become thy humble vassell, and now
yields all his purchased honors at thy gracious feet: I that by war have
foragd kingdoms, unpeopled countries, and made whole fields flowing with
blood, will now at thy roial command, kiss the sacred plot of ground, where
thy celestial foot but stangeth: I that have dyed the flinty pauements of
conquered cities with the purple goare of human carcasses: and fed my
pampered steedes with the flesh of man, am now subjected to thy thrice glorious
person, and challendge to my self, no other happiness, but one smiling glaunce
from thy angellicall eyes: grant then thy love thou Jewel of nature, and let
my soul feed upon the (...) pines that proceeds from the censure of thy
blessed tongue in condiscending to my love: legions of aduenturous knights
shall fill thy palace with renown, and by their knightly prowess, fetch
conquered kings from all the parts of the world, to one obeisance to thy
imperial greatness. And in loving me great princess (quoth. the scholar) the
unsearched studies of all sciences, shall be at thy command: the pleasures of
music, the helps of physic, the eloquence of tongues, the secrets of
stars, the natures of nations, and moreover the sweet consolation of divine
meditations, shall eleuate thy soul to the shining paradise of unspeakable
blessedness: then make a scholar happy in thy lone sweet Sola, in whose deep
understanding, lie the secrets both of air, earth and sea.

And in loving me thou paragon of beawtie, (quoth the merchant) the far fetched
treasures of rich India, the gould of Arabia, and the unvalued carbuncles of
goulen Ganges, abundantly shall fall into thy lap: I have measured the earth
seven times about, and upon the sea spread such a fleet of ships, and rich
Argoses, which like to a toplesse forest seemd to hide heaven, all these for
thee and for thy love shall sail to those nations where no sun shines, nor
moon gives light: to those kingdoms where one night continues six months,
(and their purchase by long travel) those inestimable valued vestures, which
had wont to beawtifie the proud queens of Asia: bamasks, goalden tissues, and
robes of silver, shall be as common to thy delights, as rich scarlets were to
the princes of Judea: in loving me thou shall be atended with more roilties,
then king Solomon was in all his pomp: these and such like were the proffered
courtesies of these three gallant gentlemen, every one hoping thereby to obtain
the good will of this proud Lady: who was as far from kind acceptance of their
services, as the starued Lioness is from merry when the ceazeth upon the
innocent lamb: therefore rething no other counselors but pride and ambition,
the only nurses of confusion, without any further consideration, made them
this answer.

That man (high spirited gentlemen) that in my bed shall set his foot, and
crop the bud of my virginity, the which I have denied unto kings, shall win
the same grace with a severe task or knightly adventure. First to you, thou
undaunted knight of war, if thou can either by policy or manhood, either wit
or conquest of thy sword, gain and purchase me a bed, that shall be filled with
a softer substance then the soft down, that grows upon the milk white swans
back, thou shall enjoy my love, and I will onley be thy wife: Likewise to thee
thou scholar like man of art, if by thy learning or any other deep mystery,
thou can frame me a fountain, that shall contain a purer water then that
which raines from heaven, or that which springs from the cundets of the earth.
thou shall gain my love, and I will be only thy wife. Lastly to thee thou
noble adventurous marcha^t, if thou by any travail either by land or sea,
can find me a bread that shall be better then that of wheat, thou shall have
my love, and I will only be thy wife. Upon these strict conditions, or rather
Nerculian labors, these three gallants without any further reply, departed
each one his seurall way, striving which of them should accomplish the task
proposed unto them: where we will leave them for a while travailing strange
cuntries, dilligently seeking to bring these their strange labors to an end,
and speak of the woeful miseries that the heaven aflicted this proud Lady
withal.

Many months passed over the head of this hated woman after their departures:
and as she grew in age, so did her pride increase, in so much that for the
mainteinance of her vain beauty, she had atending upon her a hundred of
fair and young wives, that once every day with the milk of their breasts,
filled a cestern of fine gould, with the which every morning she bathed her
body, only to make her beawtiful fair and white skin more smooth and
amiable: and that food which nature gave for the nourishment of young infants,
according to Gods will, she wickedly abulediu the mainteinance of pride and in
the service of the devil: This vile course of life she long wandered in,
loosing herself in the wilderness of black iniquitte, till the allseeing
seeing eyes of wrath descended heaven, and in a moment struck this proud
exeature, into such on ovious leaprosie, that neither eye could endure her
sight, nor nostrellavide her corrupting savors: now that body so finely framd
of natures chiefest mould, that lately would not endure the whistling of the
gentle winds, were now more loathsome then the spotted adder: and that clear
celestial face, that disdaind to entertain the comfortable heat of the warm
sun, was now more ovious (to man's sight) then the swelling toad and all those
Ladies that had wont to atend upon her, forsook her company, and fled her
chamber, as from adenne of snakes: they that kept nearest to her, were
distressed people and vile malefactors, such as were lately delivered from
loathsome prisons and deep dungeons: and these in contempt of heavens
judgment, caused she with sharp rasers to flea off the upper skin, from her
spotted face and leaprous body, in hope that a new, young, and fresh skin
would again grow, and that her beawtte in a lively manner would again be
replenished, and not as now blemished with one stained spot or soul ulcer: all
this according to her will was imediately performed, but to small purpose, for
the envy of heaven clothed with red vengeauce had doomed her to a miserable
death, for neither art nor nature, by any practice could ever after cover her
hated body with any kind of skin, but that all her flesh contine wed raw and
loathsome, and putrified unto her bones: in this torment (as a judgment of her
pride) remained she, desiring death, but could not dye, til the moon had twice
twelve times renewd her brightness, and that the earth had twice put on her
spring (times livery) and twice frostie bearded winter disrobd dame natures
Gardens: then, oh then returned the three wandering lovers, with conquest of
their strange adventures, earth one hoping to reap the deserts of their true
merrits.

The Soldier whose task was to find a bed filled with a solter substance then
the down feathers of swans, in this dangerous manner brought he his labor to
an end.

First, after his departure from this proud Lady Sola, he traveled many
strange countries, meeting with many strange people, and in searching many
strange places, he happend into a cave, where liu'da Satyr of such bigness, as
man's eye had hardly seen: this Satyr lived upon the spoil of traueliers,
within whose Cave lay the signs of such as he had murdered and deuowred: the
number of the dead bones and sculles which lay heaped there together, drove
such an admiration into the soldiers heart, that for a time his fear so
abounded that he stood as it were senceles: but at last being ornefied with
the bold courage of manhood, he drew forth his short semiter, and with one
blow smote of the Satyrs head, whilst he lay sleeping upon a bed stuffed
with nothing but wind, the which the soldier no sooner perceived, but he
verily believed his task to be ended, and that a bed stuffed close with
wind, were far more softer then the down of signets, so taking up the same
bed, and packing it upon his Bennet behind him, he arrived as you heard at
the palace of this proud Lady, whose misfortunes with fatal news no sooner
gave him intertainement, but he fell into a melaucholly despair, and now
seeing his long and dangerous travails, reaping no better success, as one
wearied both of life and good chance, conuaide the said windy bed into a
field, up to the top of a high mountain, where upon he laid his bruised
body, and was by the said wind imediatiely carried away for ever.

The Scholar whose long tranells and deep studdie, nothing inferior to the
Soldier, after he had spent two years practice in framing a Fountain, that
should yield such a Water, that neither rayned from heaven, nor sprung from
the conduits of the earth: a task as he thought impossible yet good chance so
directed his steps, that he arrived in the I Will of Delphos, at the Dracle of
Apollo, who after his divine sacrifice, had this pleasing answer revealed to
him: The dew of heaven is neither water from the clouds, nor water springing
from the earth: replenith a fountain therewith and so conquer fate, for inded
he conquered fate: for at his return to the proud Ladies court, in hearing of
heavens judgment laid upon her, and how that he had consumed two years labor
to no effect, he presently fell lunaticke and dyed. Lastly, the merchant tasted
of deaths cup, as dearly as the others did, for after he had brought a bread
far better then the bread of wheat, which is the bread of salvation, the sacred
bible of God which he fetched from the temple in Jerusalem: but when he saw the
end of his hopes rewarded with a vision of calamity, he departed to a desert
wilderness, only inhabited with wild beasts, where for want of food, he
famished himself to death.

Then Sola after she had intelige^ce of the lives ruins, of those 3. galla^t
gentlemen, whom she had so cruelly doomed to miserable travails, and that for
her sake they all three lost their lives, she in great despair of eternal
happiness, breathed her soul into the air, wishing her sir sisters by her
example to embrace humility.

Enuies Tragedy: The life and death of Lucina, the envious, the second
daughter to the enchanted queen.

Chap. 5.
LVcina being the second daughter to the enchanted queen, bearing in her
breast the burning fire of envy, never differed from that deadly sin, all the
date of her wretched life: for after the dicease of her proud sister, no long
time passed on, before Iulianus then king of France, took her in marriage,
whose nuptial rights these two countries solemnized, in most princely manner,
and the chiefest delights and pleasures belonging to a Queen daily attended
upon her: all things she could either wish or desire were at her commaundment:
heaven and earth concluded to make her a happy princess: only this, content
of mind wanted, for nature denied to fructifle her body, and grace her with
the name of a mother: therefore in wanting children she grew envious to the
world, and spighted those women that heaven had so blessed: now in process of
time, the king, queen and the nobility of the land road a progress, into the
country, more by their presence to win their subjects love, then for their
own contents and pleasure: and as in great state, and most princely manner,
they passed by a forest side, where then was situated the castle of an
ancient knight, and an old seruit or to the kings father in the christian
wars, and therefore was entitled one of the knights of the Roads, in which
castle as the queen passed by, a most pleasant and delightful melody of
music sounded in her ear, at which not saeing any, she greatly marvelled,
and demanded the cause of that extraordinary rejoicing: the answer was, that
upon that day was borne to the knight and lady of the castle, a man child,
who never before that time, for the space of twelve years, was graced with any:
is this the cause (said the queen) now I see bace subjects in disgrace of the
queens barrennes, will not stick but make thereof a may game, and to mine own
ears give me a dishonorable scandal, as I am now queen of frannce this
their presumption shall be quittanced with death, and short shall be the joy they
receive in this childs birth: thus envy like a conqueror, seazd upon all the
parts of her body: and with the undeserved hate she bore unto this knight and
his lady, her verry heart plotted strange confusion ^ all the way as the road
along not a word proceeded from her month, but sanord of envy and malice, and
not a flumber closed up her eyelids, but it begot dreams of hate and fury: all
her meditations were of the overthrow of these two guiltiesse souls, who
little mistrusted what deadly plots she decised against their dear lives: eury
day to this envious queen seemd a year till their progress ended, which as
ill fortune had allotted, was broke of in this manner.

The commous of Normandy and Pikardie, made an insurrection against the
nobility, and none but the kings presence could alay their tumulteous furies,
who with all speed, princely provided with men, money and munition, took his
journey toward them, whose absence no sooner gave way to the queens malice,
bat she dispatched a messenger (one of the grooms of the kings chamber) to the
betrayed knight and his lady, not yet churched commanding them by the dewtie
of aleadgeance, to repair unto the court, and give attendance in her chamber,
till the kings return (only as she dissembled) the dearest friends to trust
unto.

This message of the Queens pleasure, being no sooner delivered to the knight
and his lady, but as dutiful subjects, rejoiced that their services in the
kings absence, could bring unto the queen such high pleasure, therefore
leaving their castle in quiet government, with all convenient speed they
repaired to the queens palace, bearing with them their little child, who at
the first were intertaind with a friendly regard, and their child by the
queens commaundment taken from them, and as she said) put feorth to nurse:
but such a bloody nursery I think never tender babe induced: little suspected
the good knight and his gentle lady, what a balefull banquet was preparing for
them, for the envious and angry queen, in steed of tender paps to give the
infant nourishment, she commanded it to be made food for that womb, that
gave it first life: is having blooddie ministers ready prepared for that
tirranicall enterprise according to her wicked meaning, the prestie babe as a
service (bakt in a pie) was brought to the table of the unhappy parents, whom
the queen had then placed in two chaires in her chamber, directly the one
against the other, where after they had saitisfied hanger (unknown to them)
with the fruit of their own howels, she locking fast the chamber door,
asisted by three or feure bloody murderers, provided for the same purpose, and
bound them both fast in their chaires with hempen coardes, bands unsitting for
such noble minded personages, and being now seltered in the gins of confusion
with an envious tongue she vitered forth the rancour of her heart in this
manner.

Marvel not proud knight (quoth the queen) nor thou thou painted minion of
beawtie, at this your sudden misusage, for till I behold both your hearts
liuelesse, your eyes sightles, and your tongues speachles, the ravening fawes
of fury feeds upon my soul: what has nature in you grafted more then in me?
you being bacely borne, have the gifts of children, I royally descended, am
made barren, by desteny: and because the seed of procreation prospers in your
adulterous beds, you live in all sollitie, making rejoicing melody to my
disgrace, whilst I pining in woe, vainly desiting children cannot obtain
them: therefore know that I being a queen, having a boddie young, fair, and
likely to conceive, crossed and spighted by the cruelties of nature, have
protested a secret revenge against you, and all such as so my dishonor have
their bodies seeming with children: and now you two shall be the beginners of
my intended massacars: therefore know, as the first act to this my black
tragedy, you have fed and satisfied hunger, with the fruit of your own
bowels: so upon thee (thou father of this deed infant, by thine own self
here deuowred) I will extend such a torment, as never Lirant devised, but as
thou art a Soldier, so Soldier like shall thou finish up thy days, whervppon
she caused an armor burning red hot from the fire to be brought, and without
either mercy or pity, buckeld it unto his naked back, where (like unto
Hercules putting on the shirt that cruel Nessus sent) he made such pitiful
moan as might have enforced tears to fall from a Tigers eye, and the verry
marble stones give signs of laments, but poor knight as without cause he
indurd this dying punishment, so with great patienes yielded he up his ghoast,
in the sight of his beloved Lady, who being no less perplered with the
frights of pale death, awaited the fatal hour of the like dying torments,
which according to her sorrowful expectation, she was imediately presented
withal, for whilst she sat fast bound in her chair, gazing upon the dead
broiled body of her husband, this envious queen caused her to be stripped
stark naked, and to her two tender breasts, placed two speckled venomd snakes,
almost starued for want of food, which with their poisoned stings sucked her
hearts life blood quight through her breasts, during which time of her dying
torments, continuing for the space of an hour, these and such like
lamentations she breathed forth.

Oh you dreadful powers of heaven! why in a mild woman's breast, have you
placed a Tigers heart? why have you suffered kind to work against kind,
nature against nature, and reason against reason? one woman thus cruelly to
betray another? oh where is gentleness become? whether is mercy fled? one beast
will not hurt each other, the vilest worm the earth breeds, will by nature
pity one another: but here is a woman that has shamd her sex, distaind
nature, poluted woman kind, an enemy both to heaven and earth: she has made
me husbandlesse, and childlesse, and imediately will make me liuelesse: oh thou
celestial tower, where justice sits enthroaned open thy glorious gates toe
utertaine a widows curse, strike down with a heavy hand, let shame and
destruction pursue her to death, let some miracle of her tirany be the worlds
mark till doomes day: some strange confusion finish up her life to appease the
souls of three unfortunate wretches, only made miserable through the envy of
a malicious queen: and now thou earth farewell, thou nurse and mother of my
life adieu, let three lives in two bodies be in thy bosom intombd, for now I
feel deaths wrath tearing my heart in sunder and the verry minute of my life
fading, and gentle death now art thou welcome: thus with a groan I close thee
in my bosom: and in speaking these words the branches of her life witheced:
The envious queen thus triumphing in the victory of their destructions, not
any whit relented at the pitteous moan of this good Lady, but like an untamed
Panther, devised new cruelties against their dead bodies, which she performed
in this vile manner: Contrary to good nature and all humanity, she caused a
furnace to be heat red hot, and therein consumed the substance of these dead
bodies into pale ashes, from whences flew sparckling flames of fire, like
flakes of blood up toward heaven, as it were chalendging vengeance at the
throne of majesty.

These tirannicall deeds both against life and death were no sooner effected,
but news came unto her, of her Princely husbands return from quieting the
commons tumults, whom she purposed with a disembling countenance of joy to
entertain: so atiring herself in her richest ornaments, attended on with a
troop of honorable Ladies, some mile distant, from her blood-stained palace,
she gratulated the king with a princely welcome home: but (as the angry fates
had justly decreed) before the word of welcome could proceed from her mouth,
the heavens cast such a dark clowd over yt earth, with such a fearful
tempest, and thunder, that the fruits of the earth flamed and the leaves of
trees were scortched to satisfy ye angry wrath of heaven, whereat the king
afrighted in mind, challenged the queen of some black misdeed by her
committed, beauy in the sight of heaven, in being thus offended with the world,
but she whose heart, blushies sin had hardened, grew impatient at his
speeches, and wished that beauen might make her one of the worlds wonders, if
ever she wrought or consented to any deed of shame, other then what virtue put
her in mind to dee. this presumptious wish of hers so displeased the al-seeing
powers, that imediately the bowels of the earth cleaued, and swallowed her up
alive into her gaping womb: and directly in the same place where in sinking
she gave the world a farewell, sprung up a blood red statue of stone, seeming to
have weeping eyes, and wringing hands, which to this day there still stands,
and is recorded in the french Annalls to be one of the seven wonders of
France: the king having a confetence touched with remorce and dreading least
the heavy wrath of Heaven, should for her blood-stained sin light upon the
whole country: therefore after he had searched out the whole faction of this
black misdeed, and put them to execution: as a pilgrim bare legd, bare
footed, clothd in bairecloth, be wandered to Jerusalem, and at the Sepulcher of
Iudaes God, craud remission for this his dead queens offense: by which means
he washed away this stained spot, from his countries browe: and after spent his
days in tranquillitis and peace.

Wraths Tragedy: The life and death of Marsia the wrathful, the third
daughter to the enchanted queen.

Chap. 6.
THe third sister of this fatal generation, might in the right of nature,
challenge as great supremasie of beauty as the other her two former sisters:
and not only an amiable countenance and comely proportion, ornefied her
outward shape, but an excellent gift of art and nature beautified her inward
parts, for her mind being replenished with artificial misreries, so indiciall
in the tongues of learning, so persit in eloquence, so curtons in
needle-workes, the only exercise of prinees, that the world eseemed her one of
the muses darlings, and the verry parragon of woman kind: in her the whole
lands happiness consisted: the only excellent artist of her time, having a
supernatural gift, in the noble science of Limming. Wherein she greatly
delighted, and the more to make her fame glorious in the world, she with a
pencell portraied in a map or picture, the frame of the creation of the world:
every thing in his right shape, so lively set forth, as both beasts, fowls
and sishes seemed to retatine life: the sun, moon and stars, as it were
gave a kind of light, so artificially shaddowed she their quallities: woods,
fields, and forests appeared properly green and flourishing, and the watery
sea gliding thorough the earths bosom, glistereb like crystal, and her
swelling billows seemd to rise and fall, that no earthly eye could make a
diffrence betwirt them and the surges of the vastocean.

This excellent piece of workma^ship being to her hearts content finished, was
set to the open view of all eyes, challenged a superiority in that misery
above all others of the time: but now amongst many that came from al parts of
the kingdom, to behold this race piece of workmanship, there came one, whose
skill therein, the whole earth admired, the which in former times had bin tutor
to this Princess and first instructed her in the principles of this
delightful art: this reverent man (for his milkewhite head claimd
reuerentnesse) after he had in the presence of many noble personages,
circumspecty vewed every secret of this rare work, and marking every curyous
shadow how it was laid, lastly found a deformity in the portraiture of man,
and to this Princess disgrace, as she took it, found great fault therewith,
at which Marsias wrath so inkindled, and with such flames fiered her whole
body, that in presence of all the nobility, with a silver bodkin striking in
the goulden trammuels of her hair, she furiously stabbed the good old man unto
the heart, so greatly her wrath prevailed: this bloody and enraged fact, by
the whole assembly was generally lamented, and by her wrathful hand no sooner
done but repented, for wrath being of nature sudden, a little ouerpassed,
conuerts into remorse, so happened it with this Lady, for when her eye beheld
the purple goare of his liueles heart, panting upon the ground, she striued in
revenge thereof to tear out her own eyes, and would have committed that bloody
cruelty upon her self, had not the standers by prevented her, whereupon in
great agony, she uttered forth this enraged complaint.

Oh why will not heaven (quoth she) take my blood stained life, and breath into
his breathles body new air? or why may not my eyes forsake their hated cells,
within his eyes to give a seeing power: oh ye this breast of mine were now
vnbowelled, and this my wrathful heart torn from my bosoms closset, and
sacrifised upon that carcass, which my cruel hand has untimely slain: be
therefore of thou fatal hand, for ever lame, deny to give sustenance to this my
vile body, harboring now nothing but cogitations of revenge: grant this oh
heaven, that from henceforth I may never taste one bit of food in joy, nor
walk abroad but in discentent, nor steep but in frightfull fears, nor dream
but of melancholy despair, for my sudden hand has slain, the miracle of
humanity, within whose head, (whilst life lasted) dwelled true wisdom, a
tongue tipped with eloqnence, and a voice resounding reports of celestial
understanding: these and such like passions uttered she from the fury of her
repentant soul, which imediately had broake her heart strings, had not the
care of her Ladies, (then there atending) conducted her to her chamber, where
they with the harmony of music and melody of voices, rockt her grieved
senses into a silent flumber, in which quiet rest (as they imagined) they left
this distressed princes: but far otherwise happens still to a troubled mind,
for as she lay sighing and sobbing upon her bed, greeuing at the blood she so
wrathfully spilt, there appeared before her face, the ghastly shape of the
murdered old man, wan, and pale in visage: breathing forth hollow groans, to
the deep terror other sonle, and seemd to her affrighted eyes, to open the
closset of his bleeding breast, as it were thirsting for revenge, and desiring
blood for blood: This fearful and strange sight, so deeply molested her
conscience, that from that time forward, she banished away al thoughts of
terestialliay, and delighted in nothing but her own confusion, so heavy lay
the guilt of murder upon her soul, for after that time not any food would
she ever take into her body, nor ever after endure the fellowship of people,
nor never suffer one small flumber to close up her eye lids, but in great woe
and misery, ouerwatched and pined her self to death, to the great discomfort
and sorrow of the whole land, who by a general consent, intombed both their
bodies in one grave, and erected there upon a sumptuous sepulcher, the which
to this day stands in great glory in the city of Paris.

Avarice her Tragedy: Or the life and death of Mercuria the covetous, the
fourth daughter to the enchanted queen.

Chap 7.
THe fourth of these unhappy children, bearing the name of Mercuria the
covetous, esteeming the countries content, beyond the glories of ye court,
banishing from her self alprincely desires, accou^ting the^ the bra^ds of
ambition, and the only spurs of destruction: so making her three former
sisters a memorial example of princip allities downfall, she purposed to
spend her days as a shepheardisse in the country, where in stead of a royal
court, she had the siluaine fields and mountains to live in, and in piace of
her princely attendance, she had her flocks of sheeps to delight in, whose
plentiful increase of wool, wereas the treasures both of land and sea: her
imperial diadem, was her sheepshooke: her pleasurable music, the chirping
melody of birds: her guard, the pretty watchful curre, that with his shirle
barking gave notice of ensuing dangers: and the treasons complotted against
her, were the tyranny of deuowring wolves: but snch was her siluaine care and
country diligence, that her flocks sustained small hurt by the bloody rage of
this spoiler, by which means in short time, her riches grew invaluable, and her
treasures without number: but the greedy thirst of her wealths further
increase, so bewitched her insatiate desires, that her verry soul grew sotted
with vile covetousness, and the smallest loss thereof drew drops of blood from
her heart: she feared to trust the air with her money, least the wind should
consume it away: nor the earth, least the worms should consume it: nor the
sea, least fishes should purloine it: but in a more securermanner (as she
thought) the intended to hide it betwirt heaven and earth, that both months,
weeks days, and hours, she might with the sight thereof glutte the sight of
her thirsty eyes, so having a huge some of pure gould, closed in an Iorne
truncke, the which in a dark gloomy night, (the secret concealer of all black
deeds) she conuaide and hid in the hollow trucnk of an old withered oak,
standing betwirt two steepy hills: where the tracking steps of man sildome
treads: in which hollow tree, almost rotten with age, she secretly hid this
rich jewel of her soul: intombing it therein with these speeches: Lie thou
there (qurth she) my sweet gould, thou great commander of mankind, my
desires content, my earths happiness, my heart rauither: by seeing thee I am
ravished with joy, and in possessing thee I feed upon the pleasures of the
world: what is it not but gould can bring to pass? gould can purchase
kingdoms, and betray Princes: gould can buy preferment, and make men mighty:
gould can make the smitsh wife, and curb authority: gould can win fair
Ladies, and wrong the marriage bed: gould can tempt the chastest, and sack
virginity: nay goulde can change vice into virtue, falsehood into troth and
vile villainy into pure honesty: then be thou sweet gould my second soul, for
in loosing thee the world ends with me: in this manner left she this corrupting
gould lying in the hollow tree, purposing every day once to feed her eyes with
the bewitching sight thereof: bnt now mark what happend to this covetous
woman, the next morning by the opening of the days windows, there came unto
the same place where this gould lay, a pooreman, a disiressed wretch with a
rope in his hand, upon the same tree to end his wearisome life: the reason
was, that the pitiful cries of his wife and children, complaining for bread at
his hands he not being able to satisfy their wants, came thither to hang
himself, and so by that means rid himself from the complaining cries of his
poor wife and needy children, but as the good chance of smiling heaven was,
in tying the roap about an arm or branch of the same tree, making a noose to
put over his head, and in giving the unkind world a doleful adieu, he espied
this coffer of gould, at which he staid from that self wild murder, and being
joyful of so rich a purchase, left the rope there still hanging, and rarried
ried the coffer home, to the comfort of his wife and children: thus you see
heaven by good means, sand the dear soul of this desperate man, and relieved
the distressed estate of his almost starued family: which we leave now in groat
joy, and speak of the woeful calamitte, tied upon the back of this covetous
lady, who imediately after this poor means departure, came unto the
aforesaid tree to look upon her gould, whereby her heart might leap at the
topfull sight thereof: but no sooner found she her hopes frustrate, her gould
gone, and an instrument of death left hanging upon the tree in place thereof,
she grew into such a violent despair, that without either care of her lives
safety, orpreuention of her souls damnation, in the same cord she strangleb
herself: her body being thus made breathless, exempted from the sight of
people, had no other burial but in the ravening mawes of hungerstarued so
wies: whose strange confusion had never bin known, but through the voice of
her troubled ghoast, which walked many years after betwirt those two hills, and
revealed it to the country inhabitants: thus was her covetousness scourged for a
grievous sin, both by heaven and hell.

Gluttonies Tragedy: Or the life and death of Iouina, the drunkard, the fist
daughter to the enchanted queen.

CHAP. 8.
IOuina now the subject of our tragic story, and fist daughter to this
enchanted Queen, as fate and chance ordained, was matched in marriage to the
rich Cardinal of Lorraine, whose court for magnificece, equallizd and any
prelates before his time: for every day vprising and down lying, he had a
thousand officers in his palace, and provision for the mainteinance thereof,
were the customs of three rich dukedomes: this haughty and proud Cardinal,
was in his life so vicious, that he accounted drunkenness a deed of manhood: and
he that could best devise new feruises to pamper up gluttony, he advanced to
great authority: and his riotous table was accounted the treasury of earth,
air and sea of beasts, souls and fishes: but God owing him a grieueus shame,
in the middle of his magnificence, when he feasted at one time in the honor of
his greatness, three christian kings: to the wonder of them all, he was choakt
with a grape husk, happening in a cup of Arabian wine: this his sudden death
not only amazed the whole company, but drove such a discontent into the mind
of Iouina, that she purposed a present revenge upon the whole country: and as
the customs of ye natio^ns are, that by the death of such an imperious
prelate, all the land and reuenews falls from the wife: so she to make aspoile
thereof made such a funeral banquet, as Spaines chronicles to this day speaks
of for no sooner had the earth closed up the Cardinals perfumed body, and
delivered the same to the fary of consuming worms, but this gluttonous woman
by sound of drum and trumpets, caused a proclamation to be made throughout all
the country, of a free banquet for the space of seven days, awarding to him
or her that could rate or drink the most, a hoepe of pure gould to compass
in their bellies: she report of this deadly prize of sin, being no soouer
bruted abroad, but of rioters, spendthrists, gluttons, and drunkards, from al
parts arrived such numbers, that the walls of Lorraine could hardly contain
them, the tables whereat they sat were as natures storehouse, variably yielding
all kind of delicacies, and their pampred wombes as the insatiate gulf of
hell never suffized: some there were that had their bellies split in sunder by
ouerfilling them: some in the middle of their gluttony choakt with
superfluities, some by ouercharging themselves with wine, vomited out their
inward parts, and some fell into such deadly sleeps, as they never wakened
again and of all these multitudes of people, the tenth man departed not away
with life, so consuming a tragedy brought this vile deed of gluttony, and
drunkenness upon that country. Now Iouina her self seeing the earth almost
strewed over with stifeled carcasses began to envy at the powers of heaven, and
in contempt thereof, drew forth a sharp knife, and threw it up toward the
air, saying, I will wound fate and dismember the destinies, in crossing thus
the glory of my magnificent banquet: but the knife she cast up never more
descended, but instead thereof fell down three drops of blood, directly before
her upon the table where she sat, which strange and dismal sight stroke
terror and remorse into her conscience, and such a dispairing repentance into
her cogitations, that from that time forward (as the angry heavens had
appointed) she consumed the remnant of her life (which was but short) in bitter
lamentations: Nou black vengeance (quoth she) has doomd me with a thousand
calamities, and the scarlet canopie of destruction is even ready to close in
my hated life: in most vile courses have my loathed steps wandered in, and now
the reward thereof is shame and confusion: me thinks I hear succourles people
calling for that food I so gluttonously have spent: me thinks I hear the
vnpittied widow, and the hungry orphant, challendging my destruction: me
thinks I hears the decrepit and aged wretches, soliciting heaven for reueuge:
me thinks I hear the pining prisoners, in deep dungeons, exclayming again my
riotous gluttony, and me thinks the troubled earth, bellows up revenging
echoes, against my sin drowned body: thus mourned her relenting tongue,
till her vnstanchable womb grew as it were starued with hunger, and then
striving to suffize nature, could not, for the pipes of her lieus mainten^ce,
were clunged up, and by the just powers of mortallitie, had a heavier judgment
laid upon her, for that food which heaven and nature ordained for her lives
sustinance, were congerted into a contrary snbstance, her bread heaven changed
into stoues, her meat into venomous toads, and crawling worms: and her drink
into a puddle of poyso ne liquor, the stench and savor whereof no nosthril
could induro: thus exempted both from heavens grace and earths pity, she
languished many days, hated of God and man: till the fatal sisters finished
her wearisome life: this was the heavens scourage for gluttony and drunkenness,
as black a sin and as deadly as any of the seven.

Letcheries Tragedy: Or the life and death of Veneria the lustful, the sixth
daughter to the inchaunted queen.

Chap. 8.
STill follows one misfortune upon a nothers neck, woe upon woe, calametie
upon calametie: and this seed so wickedly sown, could not choose but be blassed
in the bloome: now to our sad discourses, no sooner had Veneria the sixth
daughter of this enchanted queen, yielded up the tender bud of her virginity,
changing her maiden head for a wives honor, being then conioynd in marriage
with the Princely king of Bohemia: before one month had consumd thirty days,
grew inamord upon a bace groom, one of the kitchen scullions, whom in her
lustful eye, seemd to be a jewel of knightly behavior, though a deformed
vassell of humble servitude, therefore as the temptations of sin had deluded
her, careless of her princely husbands honor, and regardles of her own
reputation, upon a time in her husband absence, she caused this hated
night-owle the scullion, to be sent for, touching (as she dissembled) some
serious business to be imploid in: who being no sooner privately come into her
presence, but revealing the burning heat of her lust, she gave him this unlooked
for intertainement: Little think thou good Antonio (quoth she, for so was he
named) what high promotions are heaped upon hty head: for nature in thy first
creation, ordained thee to enjoy the pleasures of a princely bed: though
envious time now burdens thee with flanery, yet fate and good fortune crowns
thee with happiness: then know thou jewel of mine eye, that my bosom
contains a heart dancing at thy presence, and without the fruition of thy
love, it will quight consume away: I being a Princess am more hapies then the
country milke-maide, for she may challenge that same love that fa^cy leads her
to, but I dare not claim the least interest of my pining passions: be not hard
hearted then dear Antonio, be as gentle as the clasping vine, hem in my body
with thy manly arms, take the pleasures of my honors sack, feed on content,
if content be in my yielding body, for I am impatient of delay: my husbands
arms are like unto she twinding embraces of serpents, his kisses as the
crokadils, and his bed more loathsome then a den of snakes: oh that nature had
made me humble as thy self, partner in thy fortunes, and thy second self,
either now yield to my desires, or I vow by him that made both heaven and
earth, I will pursue thee with a vengeance more terrible, then ever man's
icefull heart imagined: and conclude on this, that either continual happiness,
or everlasting misery is put unto thy hearts choice: now this poor wretch,
unaccustomed to these demands, stood for a time as one new dropped from the
clouds, not knowing what to resolve upon: but at last as it were ravished
with all celestial blessedness, and seeing time as he thought fit for ever to
make himself happy, by inioying the delightsome savors of so great a
princess, condescended to satisfy the desires of her barning lust: and
according to her pleasure, with black misdeeds distaind the whight honors of
her marriage bed: Veneria having thus won him to her wishes, caused his bace
affires to be stripped off and his body to be clothed in rich vestures, the
more to feed lusts gluttony, and appointed him the next night to set foot
within her adulterous bed, which in most wicked manner was accomplished: But
now mark how shame cannot lie long hid, nor the concealer of sin (dark
night) cover this polluted crime: but as confusions watchbel seunded these her
dishonours abroad, through the faithful beauty of the kings chamber-keepers,
he had intelligence thereof: so choosing to himself a selected number to effect
his revenge, at the middle hour of night, when nothing disquiesed the sleeps
of human creatures, but the gentle blustering of winds, and the musical
murmurings of running waters: he entered the chamber of this his lustful and
adulterous queen, who securely lay them sleeping in the bosom of this bace
scullion, drove such a rage into the heart of the unquiet king, as flesh and
blood could hardly endure it: therefore drawing a short semiter from his side,
he sheathed it in the breast of his wives minion, whose blood with such fury
gushed from his poluted bosom, as it wakened the sinne-stained queen, who at
the first sight of her husbands presence, in her smock all to be sprinkled
with the scullions blood, fell down upon her knees, craving remission for
that crime which she so long had thirsted after: but the enraged king to her
penitent contrition, was as remorseles as the dease adder, and as far from
granting her life, as the souls in hell be from salvation, yet being his
second self, a collop of his own flesh, and his ownely marriage choice, he
would not desfils his clear hands with her detested blood, therefore as a
pining penance for this lustful fact, for this marriage bed so distaind, for
this nuptial promise broken, for this worlds scandal, this mariedmans
dishonor, and for this everlasting spot of disgrace, he inflicted upon her a
lingering punishment, which in this manner was imediately effected: First he
caused a large coffen to be brought, wherein he put the murdered body of the
scullion: then to the same dead body, (beginning now to peutrifie and stinck)
he tied the live body of his queen, and so in the coffen closed them up both
together, that as she inioyd his fellowship in life, so might she consume with
him being dead, by which means the verry worms that bred upon the dead
carcass, in a manner deuowred up her live body: and thus were the sins of
lust and adultery, scourged with a plague but fildome heard of.

Sloths Tragedies: Or the life and death of Saturnia the sluggard, the seventh
and last daughter of the enchanted Queen.

Chap. 9
SAturnia the last, but not the unhappiest of these sisters, had the gentlest
fortune of them al allotted her, yet in striving to prevent fate, was taken in
her own trap, and when she least dreamed on, tasted of the bitter cup of
death: the world she accounted the wilderness of iniquity, and the verry
puddle of misery: therefore hating the fellowship of mankind, she purposed to
forsake all princely glories, courtly delights, and worldly pleasures, and
betake her to the solitary life of Diana, and to spend remnant of her days in
some desert wilderness, where no sin abounded. So upon an evening, without
copmpany she stole from the court, guided by the pale light of the moon, and
the twinkling starlight of heaven, she happened into a thick grove of trees,
as it were inhabited only by fayeries, elues, and the ghoastes of dead men:
day and night there seemd all one: the glorious sun as a stranger there
showed his face, and the voices of human creatures were accounted fatal to be
there heard: night-rauens, howlats, battes with leather wings, flying griffens
and kokatrises, covered quight over these thickets: upon the ground lay red
bellied worms, speckled snakes, hissing adders, venomous toads, loathsome
spiders, and sleeping doremice: so that neither heath nor grass was there to
be seen, only heaps of brown moss, upon the which she rested her
discontented body: twice twelve months without waking slept she thereupon,
only fed by the gentle means of greene-capt fairies, in which long sleep her
dreams were of the torments of hell, and the manner of her six sisters
punishments in that damned region.

First in her sleep she beheld her eldest sister, bearing the name of Pride,
attired in a garment boiled in molten lead, with a neckercher about her neck
of flaming fire: and her dainty feet seemed to walk upon red burning coals.

Next, she Beheld her second sister, called Envy, grasping in her hands a pair
of fiery stinging snakes, which as it were lay feeding upon her flesh, even
ready to burst with the abundance of blood sucked from her bosom.

Then she beheld her third sister called Wrath wading into a boiling caldron of
fire brimstone, up to the very chin, and in brazen ladels casting the same up
and down in great fury.

Then fixed the her eye upon her fourth sister named Covetousness, feeding on
melted gould, and every part of her body behung with burning pearls, saphires
and diamonds, which seemed to sear the verry flesh from her bones.

After this she beheld her fist sister, which was Gluttony sitting in a flaming
chair, at a table of red hot yorne, served by devils, with broiled loads
upon grid-yorns, and drinking down challices of boiling mettles.

The next vision was her sixth sister, named Letchery, lying in a bed of smoking
sulpher, delivered of a brood of vipers, who with their fiery teeth fed upon
her bowels, and as it were had her body spread all over with vile leaprosie.

These were her scarefull dreams and continual apparitions, in which unquiet
sleep she remained without waking, till her body grew shapeles, having no
proportion, as then made the shelter for toads, frogs, and venomous worms, to
breed in the excrements of the earth, and the deformities of nature: thus
vanished her life away in sleep, being no way able to withstand the scuaere
indignation of heaven.

Of the enchanted queens despair; and how she was carried away alive by
devils.

CHAP. 9.
IFter the death of all these seven deadly sisters, now brought to confusion
by the black doom of mortallitie: our tragic story bids us return to the
inchaunted queen, lying all this while in childbed, fightles and lame, having
no feeling in any part of her members, which miracle of misery, after she had
intelligence of her seven daughters tragical ends, asuredly believed that
then her life was at the last period, and the time of fearful death drew
near, according to her conditions made to the devil, who promised she should
live till the seven days of the week were forgotten, which she aluded to her
seven daughters so named: now fear, terror, and pining despair assailed her
on all sides: now dreaded she every minute, her souls departure to that
burning furnace, whose fire is ten times more hot then this earthly fire, and
now every small noise she heard, she supposed, to be the hurring of devils that
came to take possession both of soul and body: every minute wished she now to
be whole years, hours, millions and days endless, time to stand still, or the
world to end: now she repented her ambition, her aspiring dignities, and all
those desires of a kingdom: now repented she the selling of her soul: her
bands sealing with her own blood, and all her agreements with black hell:
every time the clock struck put her in mind of eternal damnation, and how
that hels gaping mouth stood ready to receive her: cursing the begetters and
causers of her creation: thus in deep remorse of conscience, suent she out the
tiresome day, the last day of her worldly life, till the clowdy evening with
her pitchy manly aproached, the only comparatiue of gloomy hell, the which
had no sooner shut up the bright eye of heaven, but clouds more dark then
darkness itself, checked the world with motions of pale death: such tempests of
lightning and thunder, broake from heavens crystal portalls, that it even
blasted the beauty of the earth, and atired both trees, herbs, and flowers,
in a mournful livery: this night so al mankind was a night of fear, a night
of relentles terror, a night of confused desolation, in which extremity of
horror it continued till the mid-nights hour, at which instant time with a
clamorous roaring, that seemd to shake both heaven and earth, the wrathful
powers of black hell, fetched away both her body and soul: the which being
done, the heaues cleared, the earth replenished, and after followed a time of
plenty, peace and prosperity.

FINIS.
