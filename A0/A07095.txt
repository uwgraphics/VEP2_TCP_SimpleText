Here begins the book of the subtyl historyes and Fables of Esope
which were translated out of Frensshe in to English by wylham Caxton at
westmynstre In the year of our Lord. M. CCCC. lxxxiij.
FIrst begins the life of Esope with all his fortune how he was subtle /
wise / and borne in Greece / not far fro Troy the grant in a Towue named
Amoneo / which was a nonge other dyfformed and euylle shapen / For he had a
great head / large vysage / long Iowes / sharp eyes / a short neck / corbe
backed / great belly / great legs / and large feet / And yet that which was
werse he was dombe / and could not speak / but not withstondyng all this he had
a great wit and was gretely Ingenyous / subtle in cauyllacions / And Io^^
wordez


This historye conteyneth / How he excused him of that was Imposed to him /
that he should have eten the fygges of his lord

ANd for as much as his lord to whom he was bound supposed that he was not
prouffytable / he sent him to labor in the Feldes / and to dyke and delue in
the earth / And on a day as his lord came in one of his Feldes / one of his
laborers gadred Fygges / And presented them to his Lord / saying / My lord
take these Fygges as for the first fruit of this field / And the lord
received them Ioyously / and delyuerd them to his servant named Agatopus /
chargyng him to keep them / till he that day returned fro his bayne / And hit
happed that Esope coming from his labor / demanded his dinner like as he was
acustomed / And Agatopus which kept the figs ete of them / and said to one
of his felawes / if I doubted not / and fered my maystre / I would ete all
these fygges / And his felawe said / if thou wylt late me ete with the / I
shall find a subtylyte that we shall have no blame ne harm therefore / And
how may that be said Agatopus / to whom his felawe said / when my lord shall
come home / we shall say to him / that Esope has eten them / And by cause he
can not speak / he shall not conne excuse him / and so therefore he shall be well
beten / and herupon they went and ete the fygges bitwene them both / saying
this vylayne shall be well beten / And the lord / which came out of the bayne /
commanded to bring to him his fygges / and Agatopus said to him / Sire when
Esope came fro his labor fro the feld / he fond the Celer open / and went in
without rayson / and has eten all the fygges / And when the lord herd this /
he was much angry / and said call to me Esope / to whom he said / thou
counterfayt chorle / how is this happed / that thou have not be aferd to ete my
fygges / whereof he was aferd / in beholding them that had accused him / and the
lord commanded to despoylle and take of his clothes for to have beten him /
and he kneled down at his lords feet / and by signs by cause he could not
speak prayed his lord to give him space to excuse him / And his lord granted it
to him / And anon after he took a vessel full of hot water / whi che was on
the fire / and poured the hot water in to a bacyn / and drank thereof / and
anon after he put his fyngre in his mouth and cast out that which was in his
stomak / which was only water / for that day he had tasted nothing but water /
and he praid that his accusers might sembably drink of that water as he had
done / And so they did / And they held their hond to fore their mouth / By
cause they should have no vomyte / but by cause the water was hot / and their
stomach resolved by the water / they vomyted out the water and all the fygges
to gydre / And the lord seeing that / said to them / why have ye lied to me /
against this Esope that can not speak / And then he commanded to despoylle
them / and to beat them openly / saying / who someuer does or says wrong of
other / shall be punysshed with the same pain that is due therefore / And these
things seen and experymented / Esope returned to his labor / And as he
labored in the field / there came a priest named ysydys / which went toward
the Cite / and had lost his way / And he seeing Esope / prayed him that he would
enseygne him the right way for to go in to the Cite / And Esope received him
ioyously / And made him to sytte under a fygge tree / And set to fore him
bread / Herbs / fygges and dates / and prayed him to ete / and drew water out
of a pyt and gaf him to drink / And when he had well eten / he took him by
the hand / and set him in the right wey for to go to the Cite / after which
things done / the priest lift up his hands to heaven / making his prayers for
Esope / of whom he had received so good a refresshynge /

This History makes mencyon how the goddess of hospitalite gaf speech of his
tongue to esope / and how he was sold

Then Esope returned to his labor / And after when he had well labored /
for teschewe the great hete of the son after his usage / he went in to the
sha dowe for to rest / and slepte under a tree / And then the goddess of
hospitalite appyered to him / and gaf to him sapyence and abylyte / And also
she gaf to him the yefte of spe che for to speak diverse fables and Inuencions
/ as to him which was ryt devout to hospitalite / and after when esope was
awaked / he began to say to him self / I have not only slept ne swetely rested
but also I have had a fair dreme / and without any empessament I speak / and
all that I see I call by their propre names / as an horse / an ass / an ox
/ a charyot / and to al other things / I can to eueryche give his name / For I
have received suddenly the grace of this knowledge / for the great pity that I
have had on them that lack hospytalyte / For he that does well ought to have
good hope in god / and he shall have good reward therefore / And therefore I
shall not labor the loss / than I did to fore / And thus when he began
to labor came he that had the charge of the field and the ouersyght / And
anon began to beat one of the laborers grievously / whereof Esope was gretely
displeased / And said to him in this manner / what betest thou him for naught /
and every hour thou come and betest us without cause / thou sleest us / and
do naught thy self / But certainly I shall show to my lord all this matere
/ like as thou shall we know / And when the procurour herd him called by his
own name zenas. he merueylled that Esope spoke / and thought in him self / I
shall goo to fore my lord / to the end that this foul vylayne complain not on
me / and that my lord depose me not of my procuracion / And he took his mulet /
and rode in to the Cite / and came to his lord and said My lord I salewe you
right humbly / And the Lord looked on him / and said to him / why come thou so
effrayed and troubled / And zenas said to him / that now in the field is happed
a thing monstrous / And what is that said the lord / have the trees brought
forth their fruit to fore their time / or have the bestes brought forth their
fruit against na ture / And zenas answered him / Nay my lord / but this crooked
chorle / this counterfayted Esope thy servant begins to spe ke clearly /
And well said the lord / that me seems is a thing monstrous / ye forsothe said
zenae / And then said the lord / We see al day / many men when they ben
angry conne not speak / but when they be in pees conne well speak / and
profferr^^ things / And then zenas said / My lord he can speak above al
other men / And has said to me things contumelyouse / blasphemies / and
vylonyes of the / and of all the gods / And then his lord was angry / and
wroth toward him / And said / zenas / goo thou to the feld And what thou wylt
do with him / hyhe or low / do hit / or selle him / or give him / or lose him
/ For I give him to the / And then zenas took this yefte by writing / and
came in to the field / and said to Esope / Now thou art mine / and in my
puyssaunce / For my lord has given the to me / And by cause thou art a great
langager / and an euyllr chorle / I shall selle the utterly / And then of
fortune hit happed that a Merchant that had bought servants came in to that
feld for to bye beestes for to bear oueralle his marchaundyse to Ephese / the
which met with zenas / And he sale Wed him / and demanded of him / if he
had any bestes to selle / And zenas ansuerd that for nothing / he should find
no bestes to selle / but I have a servant which is not fair / but he is of
good age / And demanded of him if he would bye him / And the Merchant said / I
would first seen him / And then zenas called Esope / and showed him to the
Merchant / And when the Merchant saw him so dyfformed / and so foul said
in this manner / Fro whens is this Tupyn comen / and this trompette of
Tragetenus / This is a fair marchaundyse / For if he had not a wys / I would
wene / that hit were a botell full of wynd / ye be well occupied to bring me
hydre to show me this fair personage / I had supposed thou would have sold
to me sum fair servant honest / and playsaunt / And then the merchant
returned on his way And Esope followed him / and said to the Merchant / Abide
a little here / And the Merchant said / let me not vylayn For thou may
have no prouffyte of me / For if I bought the I should be called the Merchant
of folyes / and of wine things And then Esope said to him / Wherefore then
art thou come hyder And the Merchant ansuerd for to bye some thing that is
fair / but thou art foul / over lothely / and countrefayted / I have not for
to do with such Marchaundyse And then Esope said if thou wylt bye me thou
shall lose nothing / And the Merchant demanded / whereof may thou do to me
any prouffyte / And Esope said / ben there not in thy hows little children / ne
in thy town / that cry and ren ne / bye me / and thou shall do wisely and
shall be their may ster / for they shall dread and fere me like a falls vysage
/ And then the Merchant smyled for the words of Esope / And returned to
Zenas / and axed of him / how he would selle this fair Marchau^dyse / And
then zenas said to him / give me thyrtty pound / or three half pens / For I
wot well / no man will bye him / And then the Merchant paid for him to
zenas as much / as he was well content / And then Esope went with his new
master unto his town / And as he entryd in to his hows / he had two
children lyenge in the lap of their mother / Then Esope said to the
Merchant Now shall thou have experyence of that I have promised / For sith
these two little children have seen me / they have been all seylle and aferd /
And then the Merchant lawhyng bid him to enter / and seeing the felawes
fair and playsaunt salewed them / saying I salewe you my fair felawes / And
when they saw Esope / they sayden all / we shall anon have a fair
personage / what will our Master do / for to bye such a man so foul and
difformed / And their lord ansuerd to them / by cause I have fou^den no bestes
for to help you / there fore I have bought this galau^d for to help you to
bear my caryage / And therefore depart emonge you the fardels for to bear / And
then Esope said to them / O good felawes / ye see well / that I am leest and
feblest / I pray you to give to me the lyghtest burden / And his felawes said
to him / by cause / thou may not do / bear nothing / To whom Esope said /
by cause ye do all the labor It is not sitting / that I only should be idle
and vnprouffitable to my lord


This historye makes mention / how Esope demanded the lyghtest burden / but
to their semyng he took the heuyest / which was at last the lyghtest / and
so begyled his felawes

Then his felaws said to him / chese which thou will bear And Esope beholding
all the burthene the fardels sacks / and panyers / And took a panyer full of
bread / For which two of the berers were ready for to have borne / and said /
now take me this panyer here / And then they said / he was the most fool of
them / by cause he asked the lyghtest / and chese the heuyest / And so he
took the panyer of bread / and went forth to fore all his felawes / which
when his felawes beheld and saw / they all sa^^den that their master had
not lost his money / For he was strong and might bear yet an heuyer burden /
And thus they mocqued him / And alwey Esope was at the lodging to fore his
felawes / And when they were aryued at their lodging / their master made them
to rest / And commanded Esope to bring forth bread for to ete / and so he
took bread out of his panyer / that his panyer was half empty / And then
when they had eten / ^^he of them took his burden / And Esope bare less
than he did / And came to his lodging to fore his felawes / And at souper he
gaf to them so much bread / that his panyer was al wide and empty And on the
morn in this wise he took his panyer / and went to fore his felaws so far
that they knew him not a right / so that one demanded / who is he / that goth
so far to fore ve / And another said / It is the cou^^d and counterfayted
^^se / which by his subtylyte has deceived ve / that ^^re the burdens not
consumed by the way / but he has wyded his burden / And is more wyly than we
be / And then after they came to Ephese / And the merchant ladde his
marchau^dyse to the market / and also his servants for to selle / which were
named Gramaticus / Sal^^s and Esope / And a Merchant said to him / yt thou
wylt selle thy servants at a reasonable (...) / th^^ is a philosopher named
Exanctus / to whom mo^^* pe^^ goo to learn at a place called Somnon / led thy
servant thither / And that philosopher will bye them / and the master and
owner of them did do well awye Gramaticus and Saltis with new Row / and ladde
them thither for to selle / but by cause Esope was foul and lothely / he was
clad with (...) / and was set between the other two / which were fair /
playsaunt / and welfarynge men / But all they that beheld Esope were abashed
by cause of his deformyte / saying / fro whens comes this monstre / or who
has brout him hyder to mocque us / And by cause that they so wondered on Esope
/ Esope looked al ouerthwartly on them boldly /

This historye contained the second sale of Esope /


Exanctus the philosopher departed out of his hows / and went to the market /
and as he wen^^ to and fro thorugh the market / he saw these two young men /
And Esope standing between them / And he merueylled of the Inprudence of the
Merchant that so had sorted them / and approchynge to one of them / said to
him in this manner / of what country art thou / And he ansuerd I am of Capadoce
/ And Exantus demanded saying / what can thou do / And he ansuerd I can
do all thing that thou wylt / which ansuer when Esope herd / he lowhe
showing his great teethe / And all the scolers that were with Exantus
beholdynge Esope so sore lawhynge / and in lawhynge showed his great treth /
them seemed / they saw a monstre / and not a man / And said to their felawes
that this great paunsart has great teeth / And they asked what they had seen /
And they said that he so sore laughed and showed his teeth / And they said / he
lawhed not / but that he was a cold on his teeth And one demanded him / why he
laughed calling him gen till galaunt / And he said to him / what have thou to
do there with cokyn / goo walk on the gybet / And the scoler departed all
ashamed and followed his master / And then Exantus demanded the prys of
Saltis / And the merchant said that he should pay for him a thousand pens /
And Exantus estemynge the prys over dear / returned to that other felawe / and
said to him / of whens art thou / And he said I am borne of lydye / and
Exantus asked of him / what canste thou do / and he ansuerd / all that thou
wenest / which when Esope herd / he lawhed then more than he did to fore /
And thus when the scolyers saw him lawhe / they sayden / this felawe lawhyth
for all thing / Then the Marchannt asked / what shall cost me gramaticus /
and the Merchant said three thousand scutes / which Exantus thought to dear /
and wence his way / Then the scolyers said to their master Exantus / Master
/ these servants please the not / yes said Exantus / they please me well /
but it is ordained in our Cite that no servant may be bought at so hyhe a prys
upon a great pain And one of the scolyers said / sithe they that be^^ fair
may not be bought / bye him that is so foul and so disformed / and truly he
shall do to the sum seruyse / and the ^^ys that he shall be sold fore / we
our self shall pay / And then Exantus said to them / if I should bye this
felawe / that is so foul and lothely / my wife should not be well pleased / For
she is so precious and so delycious / that she may not suffer to be served with
such a counterfayted servant / And the scolers said / Master thou have many
things / of which thy wife shall not gaynsay ne meddle / And Exantus then^e
said / late us then demand him what he can do / l^^st for fault of
asking we lose onre money / And turned him to Esope / and said / god save the
young man / And Esope said to him in this manner / I pray the grieve me not /
And Exantus said to him / I salewe the / And Esope said / so do I the / And
Exantus said / leave these molestes / and ansuer to this that I shall demand
/ And he asked what art thou / And Esope ansuerd / I am of flesh and bone /
And Exantus said / I demand the not that / but where were thou engendrid And
Esope ansuerd / in the womb of my mother / And Exantus said / yet I ask the
not that neither / But I ask of the / In what place thou were borne / And
Esope said / My mother never told / ne assured me / whether she was delyuerd of
me in her chamber or in the halle / and Exantus said / I pray the tell me
what thou can do / And Esope said / no thing And he said / how nothing /
And Esope said by canse my felawes that been here have said that they will do
al thing / then have they left to me nothing for to do / then the
scolyers were much abashed / and had great merueylle / saying that he had
ansuerd by dyuyne sapyence / For there is none that may be founden that can do
al thing / And therefore he lawhed / And Exantus said / I pray the / tell me
/ if thou wylt that I bye the / And Esope said / that is in the / no man shall
enforce the thereto / Nevertheless / if thou wylt bye me / opene thy purse / and
tell thy money / and make the bargayne / Then the scolyers said / by all
the gods / this felawe surmounteth our maystre / And Exantus said to him in
this manner / if I bye the / wylt thou flee aweye / To whom Esope ansuerd / if
I will flee awey / I counceylle the bye me not / And Exantus said / thou say
well / but thou art over lothely and dyfformed / to whom Esope said / me out
not behold only the face of a body / but al only thentendement of the courage
/ And then Exantus demanded of the Merchant / what shall I pay for this
Esope / And the mar chaunt said to him / thou art a folysshe Merchant for to
leave these goodly and fair servants / and wylt take him / that nothing can
do / take one of these two / and let this bossute goo / And Exantus said / I
require the / tell me what I shall pay / And the merchant said lx pens /
And the scolyers told out the money to the merchant / And thus by this
bargeyne Esope was servant to Exantus / And when the Banquers received the
money of this sale / they demanded curyously who were the byar and the sellar
/ And then Exantus and the Merchant composed and accorded between them /
that he had not be sold for so much money / And then Esope said to the
bancquers / certainly this is he that has bought me / and this is he that has
sold me / which thing they will deny / wherefore I afferme / and seye that I
am fre / Then the banker lawhed of this cauyllacion / and went and received
the prys of exantus of as much as he had bout esope


This Historye conteyneth how Exantus brought esope home to his wife

Then when every man was departed / Esope followed Exantus homeward to his
hows / And when he came to fore his hows / he said to Esope / Abide here a
while to fore the gate / till I goo in for to preyse the to thy lady and
maystresse my wife / well said Esope / And Exantus entryd in to his hows / and
said to his wife / Dame ye shall no more have cause to be at debute with me /
For ye have desired long to get you a fair servant / wherefore now I have
bought one / that is so wise and so playsaunt that thou never saw none so
fair / And when two Damoyselles servants herd him say so / wenynge that it
had been troth they began to strive to gyder / and that one began to say
to that other / My lord has sought for me a fair husbond / And that other said
/ I have this night dremed / that I was married / And thus as these servant
spoke / his wife said / My lord where is the fair felawe / the which ye preyse
so much / I pray you that I may see him / And Exantus sa yd / he is to fore
the yate / And his wife said / I pray you bring him in / And thus as the young
wymmen had debate for him / one of them thought in her self / I shall be the
first that shall see him / And if I may / he shall be my husbond And so as
she issued out of the hows she said / where is this fair yongman / that I so
much desire to see / And then Esope said to her / what demaundest thou / I
am he / boo here / And when she saw Esope / she was for fere al abashed and
troublod / and said to him / art thou the fair pecok where is thy taylle / And
Esope said to her / if thou have need of a taylle / thou shall not faylle of
one / And thene as he would have gone in / the servant said to him / Come not
here within / For all they that shall see the / shall flee away / And after
she went in to her felawes / and told what he was / And that other when she
came out and saw him so dysformed / said / beware thou payllard that thou
touch me not / that the deuylle to (...) the / And then when Esope entryd
in to the hows / anon he presentyd him to the lady / and when the lady saw
him / anon she turned her vysage / and said to Exantus / For a servant / thou
have brought me a monstre / throw and cast him out / And Exantus said to her
/ My wife thou ought now to be glad and Ioyons / by cause I have brought to
the so fair and so Joyous a servant / And she said to Exantus / I wot well
thou love me not / For thou (...) to have another wife / And vy cause thou
durst not tell it me / thou have brought this great payllart / to the end that
I shall go fro the / And I will no longer abide / vy cause thou know well /
that I may not suffer him / And therefore deliver to me my dowayr / and I shall
anon goo my way / And then Exantus said to Esope when we were on the way
thou spackest largely / and now thou say naught / And Esope said to him / by
cause thy wife is so malycious put her in prison / And Exantus then said to
him / hold thy pees / thou shall be beten / See thou not / that I love her
more than my self / Then said Esope / I pray the / that thou love her well /
And he said / wherefore not / And Esope smote his foot on the pament / and
cried with a loud voys. herke ye a great miracle /



THis philosopher Exautus is ouercomon of a woman And he turned to his lady /
and said to her / Madame I pray the / take not mine words in evil / thou wol
dest have a servant that were young / well fourmed / well arrayed strong and
rich / for to serve the at the wine / and bear the to thy bed / that can
rub and clawe thy feet / and no^^ such a foul and so disfourmed a servant
as I am / For by cause of such a mygnot / thou would set naught by thy hus
bond / And therefore Erupis that philosopher had his mouth of gold / which
never lied / he said that there were many peryls and torments in the sea and
other great Ryuers / And also pouerte is a great chagre and dyffycyle to be
borne / And also there ben other great dangers and peryls Infynyte / but there
is no werse danger ne peril / than is a f^^ woman / And therefore Madame I
pray the / that thou take no more a fair servant ne playsaunt for to serve the
/ to the end / that thou dishonor not thy lord and husbond / And she then
said to Esope / Avoid thou payllart / which art not only disformed of ^^ody
/ but also of thy words / when thou say so by me / but I shall well pay
the / For I shall go my way / Then said Exantus to Esope / ne see thou
not how thou have angryd my wife / See that thou appease her / And Esope said /
It is not a light thing tappease the ire of a woman / but it is a grievous
thing Exanctus said to Esope / Speak no more / For I have bought the for to
make pees / and not for to make debate ne war

This Historye conteyneth how Exantus brought Esope in a gardyn


EXantus bad Esope take a panere / and follow him in to a gardyn / and exantus
said to the gardyner / give to us of thyn herbs / and the gardyner cut of
herbs and delyuerd to Esope / and he took them / and exantus paid for them /
and when they would have gone / the gardyner said to Exantus / Maystre I pray
the that thou tarry here a while / well said exantus / ask what thou will / And
the gardyner demanded of him Master what is the cause / that the herbs that been not labored grow faster and sonner / than they that been curyously
labored / and to this question ansuerd Exantus / that that came by some
prouydence / by which the things ben brought forth / And when esope herd this
ansuere / he began to lawhe And Exantus said to him / thou payllard lawhest
thou me to skeen and mockest me / and esope ansuerd and said I mock you not
but him that has learned the thy philosophye / what solucion have thou made /
what is that comes of dyuyne prouydence / a child of the kechyn should have
made as good an answer / and Exantus said then / Esope make thou then a
better solucion / and Esope ansuerd to him / if thou command I shall glad ly /
and Exantus said to the gardyner / it apperteyneth not to him that has for to
Judge things dyffycyle / to Judge rude things and (...) / but I have a servant
here which shall inform and give the solucion of thy question if thou wylt
pray him to give to the the solucion / And the gardyner said / can this vy
layne payllard that is so gretely dysformed ansuere to this question / hen
the gardyner said to Esope / have thou know leche of such things / And Esope
said ye more than all the men of the world / For thou demaundest wherefore the
herbs that been not labored grow sonner than they that been sown and labored
/ And Esope sa d understand well to mine ansue re / For as a woman that has been
a wedowe has had children by her first husbond that is deed / And after (...)
remaryed to another man / which has ^^de children of an other wife to fore /
and to the children of her first husbond she is mother / And to the other
children she is but s^^oder / And ^^s ^^her is a dyfference bitwene her own
children and the chil dren of that other woman / For her children she has
nourysshed ^^sybly / and the other ste^^children oftymes in anger and wrath /
Right so in this manner ^^s of the earth / For she is mo der of the herbs that
grow without to be labored sown o^^ s^^ / and is but stepmoder to the
herbs that grown by labor and force / And then the gardyner said to him /
thou have delyuerd me of a great pain and study / And therefore I pra^^e the
of the herbs that been in my gardyne thou take thy playsyr and will at al times
and a^^ often (...) thou wylt

This Historye following makes mention how Esope b^^re the present

ON a time when the scolyers had been in the audytoyre with Exantus / one of the
scolers arrayed precious metes for the souper / And when they were at souper /
they took of the most best metes and put them in a plater / and exantus said
to Esope / go bear this to her that loves me best / and Esope thought in him
self / now is hit time to avenge me of my maystresse / and when he came home in
to the halle he said to his maystresse / Madame / beware that ye ete not of
this mete / And his lady said / I wot well / that thou art alwey a great fool
And Esope said to her / Exantus has not commanded me to give it to the / but
to her that loves him best / Then esope pre sented the plater to a little
hound / which was always in the hows / saying to the hound my lord has sent
to the this mete which is precious / and the wife of Exantus went in to her
chamber / and began to weep / and after Esope returned to exantus / and he
asked how his love ferd / and he said right well my lord / and all the mete that
I have set to fore her / she has eten it / and exantus said / what said she
/ and he said my lord she says no thing / but she desires sore for to see the
/ After this when they had well eten and dronken / they had many questions to
gydre / And one asked when mortal men shall have most to do / And Esope said
that shall be at the day of Judgment when men shall rise / and the sco lers
herynge that ansuere / began to lawhe saying this vylayne is full of ansuers
/ and one of the scolers demanded / master wherefore is it that when the sheep
goth to his death ward he so loweth his master / and says not a word / and
when the swyne is brought to be slain / he ne does but cry and braye / And
Esope ansuerd them / by cause it is acustomed for to milk the shep and to
shere / and he weneth that he shall be molken and shorn / and therefore he
fereth not to follow ne come / But by cause the swyne is not acustomed to be
molken ne to be shorn / but to be laten blood and l^^se his life / therefore he
is aferd and dredeth when he is taken / and all the scolors said / it was
truth / ^^o this man is wise and has said well / and each man aroos and went
home to his hows / Thus then when Exantus wa^^ returned in to his hows / he
entrid in (...) his chamber / and fond his wife sore wenyng / And he said to
her / My sweet love / how is it with you / and kyssed her / and she turned the
back to him / and said late me allone / I have not to do with the / I will go
out of this hows / thou love better thyn hound than me / to whom thou have
sent the precious mete / And by cause he knew nothing hereof / he demanded her
what mete has Esope brought to the / and she said none at all / and exantus
said am I drunk / I have sent to the by Esope a plater full of precious mete /
and she said / not to me but to thy houn^^ / ^^henne he called Esope / and
demanded him / to whom he had given the mete that I delyuerd to the / and he
said to her that loves the most like as thou commaundest me / And Exantus said
to his wife / understand thou not what he says / I understand him well said
she / but he gaf to me nothing / but gaf it to thyn hound / and Exantus turned
him to Esope / and said to him / thou great head to whom have thou borne the
mete that I delyuerd to the / And Esope ansuerd to her that loves the best /
And Exantus demanded who is she / And Esope called the little hou^d and s^^d
this is she here / for the love of thy wife is right naught for if she be a
little angry / inco^tynent she reprocheth the and says vylonye to the that
love her / And will anon say / I goo fro the / and leave thy hows / And if
this hound go fro the / call her again / and she comes to the anon making
to the chere / And therefore thou ought to say to thy wife / and not to her
that loves the best / Then Exa^tus said to his wife thou see that this
felawe is a raylar and an Inuentar of words / And therefore have pacyence / For
I shall find cause to avenge the and beat him / And she said / do what thou
wylt / For I shall never more have to do with him / and of ter that take thyn
hound / For I goo my way / And without saying Fare well / she went home to her
friends / And by (...) se Exantus was angry and sorrowful for her departing /
Esope said to him / Now see thou well / that thy wife that is gone loves the
not / but this little hound abides with the / And by cause Exantus was al heavy
for the departing of his wife / he did do pray her to return / but the more
that she was prayed / so much more was she obstynate / For the more a man
prays a woman / the more does she the contrary /

This historye makes mention / how Esope made his lady to come home ageyye


ANd by cause Exantus was angry for the departing of his wife / Esope said to
his master / he not angry / for without prayenge I shall anon make her to
reto^^ne and come home again / And after Esope went to the market / and
bought capons and poullay^^ / And as he bare them passing by the hows / wher^^
his maystresse was / It happed / that one of the servants of the hows came out
/ and Esope demanded him / have ye sentt no thing to the wedding of my lord
/ do what weddyng said the servant / unto the wedding of Exantus said Esope /
For to morn he shall wedde a new wife / And anon the servant went in to
the hows / and s^^ yd to Exantus wife / Madame there ben new tydyuges / And what
ben they said she / Exantus shall have a new wife / and be married / And
forthwith incontinent she departed / and came home to the hows of Exantus
cryenge / Now know^^ I well the truth / And wherefore thou made this great
paystart to anger me / by cause thou would take another wife / but I shall
keep the well there fro / As long as I shall live shall never woman come here
in / exantus be thou sure / Then was Exantus glad / and well joyous for to
have again his wife And could Esope great thank /

This Historye conteyneth how Esope arrayed tongues


ANd a little while after Exantus bad his scolers to dyne with him / And said to
Esope / goo anon to the market / and bye for us the best mete / that thou
shall fyn de / And Esope went to the market / he thought in him self / Now
shall I show / that I am no fool but wise / And when Esope came to the market
/ he bought the tongues of swyne and oxen / And dyghted them with vynegre / and
set them on the table / And the scolers said to Exantus / thy dinner is full of
philosophye / And this Exantus said to Esope / bring us other mete / and Esope
brought forth moo tongues arrayed in another manner / that is to wete with
garleck and oynyons / And the scolers said Maystre these tongues ben well
dressid For that one dyfferensyth fro the other / And exantus badde esope to
bring other mete / And esope brought yet forth tongues / Then were the
scolyers angry / and said / wylt thou alwey give us tongues. And exantus al
angry in his courage / said to esope / what other mete have thou ordained for
us / And esope said / forsothe none other / And exantus said to eso pe / Ha
great head / said I not to the / that thou sholdest bye the best mete that thou
coudest find / So have I do said Esope / And I thank god that here is a
philosopher / I would feign know of the / what is better than the tongue / For
For certainly al art / al doctrine and philosophye ben notyfyed by the tongue
/ Item for to give salewes / bye / selle / and to do syte men / All these
things ben done by the tongue / the men ben preysed there by / And the grettest
party of the life of mortal men is in the tongue / And thus there is no thing
better than a good tongue / ne no thing more sweet / ne better of sauonr / ne
more profitable to mortal men / Then said the Scolyers to Exantus / thou
have wrong to anger the thus / For Esope has said right well / And after all
these words they arise fro the table / And on the morn after Exantus would in
excusing him self / of their little seruyse desired them to come again at
souper / And they should have other seruyse / And Exantus said to Esope in the
presence of them that were there / goo in to the markette / And bye the werst
mete that thou can find / For all my friends here shall soupe with me / and
Esope without troublyng of him self went to the bocherye / And bought again
tongues / And dyghted them / as he did to fore / And when they came to souper
/ he served them with tongues as he did the day to fore / And the scolers said
/ we ben comen ageyn to tongues And by cause the scolers were not pleased /
Exantus said to Esope / thou great head / said I not to the / that thou
sholdest bye the werst mete that thou coudest find / so have I done said Esope
/ what is werse or more stynkynge than the euylle tongue / by the tongue men
ben perysshed / by the tongue they come in to pouerte / by the tongue the
Cytees ben destroyed / by the tongue comes much harm / Then said one of
them that satte at the table / Exantus / if thou set thy purpos to this fool
/ he shall bring the out of thy wit / For he shows well by his form to be
shrewysshe / For like as he is disformed of his body / so is he of his courage
/ And Esope said to him / thou art right euylle / For thou set and make
stryf between the master and the servant / And wenest to be more curyous than
other / And Exantus for to have cause to beat Esope said ^^a great head / by
cause thou call the philosopher curyous / go get me a man / that sets ne
retcheth by no thing / that is to say that is not curyous /



ESope departed / and went out of the place / beholding here and there / if he
could find any man / that retchid of no thing / he took head / and saw a man
/ a great vy layne / syttyng upon a block shaking and waggyng his leg ges / To
whom Esope said / My lord prays the to come dyne with him / who anon arose
without saying of any word and entryd in to the hows with Esope / And not
saying god keep you satte him at the table / And Exantus said to Esope What man
is this / And Esope said to him / A man that retcheth of no thing / Then
Exantus said to his wife secretly / to the end that we may avenge us on Esope /
and beat him well / Fair love do that I shall bydde you / Then he said a
loud with an hyhe voys / Dame put water in a bacyn / and wesshe this pylgryms
feet / For he thought the vylayne would not have suffered it / but have fled for
shame / And than should he have cause to have beten Esope / Then the lady took
water / and put it in a bacyn / and began to wasshe the vylayns feet / And
how well / that he wist that she was the lady / yet he thought / this lord will
do me worship / and suffered her to wasshe his feet without saying of any word
/ And Exantus said to his wife / Dame give him drink / And the vylayne said to
him self / It is well reason / that I drink first / And took the pyece / and
drank as much as he might / And Exantus took a plater with fysshe / and
set it to fore him / And the vylayne began to ete / And Exantus said to the
cook / this fysshe is not well arrayed / Then Exantus commanded to strype the
Cook and beat him well / And the vylayne said to him self / this fysshe is well
dyght / and the Cook is beten without cause / but I retche not / so I may
fylle my belly / And I shall al wey ete / and say nothing / And Exantus said
to the baker / bring hyder the tarte / Incontinent as the tarte was set on
the table / And the vylayne brake it in pyeces / and without any words he
began to ete thereof / And Exantus beholding him how he ete / called the baker
/ and said this tarte is evil baken and has no savor / And the baker said /
if I made it / it is well dressyd / And if it be none of mine / the blame is not
in me / but in thy wife / And Exantus said (...) he alwey looked / and byheld if
he voyded hit with his fylthe or ordu^^ / when he had purged his belly / And
ever after men loken when they have purged their belyes / what they Wide / but
thou ought not to doubt thereof / For thou have n^^ wit to los^^ / ne
science / For to a folysshe demand / belongs a folysshe answer / And on
the morn next following as Exantus was set at the table with all his
friends / holdyng a pyece full of wyn in his hand shoste for fere of the
questions that men asked of him / And Esope said to him / My master Dyonysyus
says that the good wyn has three virtues / The first is Wluptucsyte / The
second is gladness / and the third is that it makes men foolys and out of
their wits wherefore I pray the / l^^te us drink Ioyously and make good
chere / And by cause Exantus was as then almost drunk / For he had well
dronken said to Esope / hold thy pees / For thou art counceyller of hell / And
Esope said to him again / keep the well / For if thou find me in hell / I
shall avenge me on thy self

ANd then one of the scosyers said / seeing / that exantus had drunk enough /
and was charged of over much wyn / said to him / My master I ask of the / if
a man might drink all the sea / wherefore not said Exan tus / I my self shall
drink it well / Then said again the scolyer / And if thou drink it not /
what wylt thou lose / and Exantus said my hows / I am content said the scoler /
and against hit I shall leye an honderd crowns / And the paction^^ and
bargayne thus between them made gaf for gaige or pledge each of them two their
signets of gold / and then went home / And on the morn as Exantus was risen
up out of his bed / and saw that he had not his ring on his fyngre / he
said to Esope / know thou not where my ring is I wot not said Esope / but
well I me remember and know for certain / that this day we shall be put out
of this hows And why said Exantus / Esope said to him / Remembryst thou not the
b^^rgeyne and paction that thou yesterday at even made / And what be they said
Exantus / Thou art bound to drink out all the see / and for gage and pledge
have thou left thyn ring of gold / And when exantus herd these words he
was sore abashed / and said / In what manner shall I drink out all the sea /
this may not be / for hit is Impossyble / wherefore Esope I pray the to
counceylle me / if it pleases to the / so that I may Wynquysshe / or else to
br^^ke and set that bargayn and paction at naught / And Esope said to him
thou shall not Wynquysshe / but parauenture I shall make / that thou shall well
break the paction / And the manner of hit said Esope is this / that when thyn
aduersarye shall requy re the to do and fulfylle thy promise / thou shall
charge and command to thy servants / that they bring a table / and al
such other things that been necessary to it upon the Ryuage of the sea / and
make the botelers and servant to abide there with the / And before all the
company thou shall make a pyece to be wasshen and filled full of the water of
the S^^e / and shall take it in thy hand / and pray that the paction may be
declared before all the felauship and say that thou wylt asseure the promise
as well before drink as after / And then thus shall thou say to all the
felauship / My lords of Sa mye ye know how yesterday at even / I made
promise to dryn ke all the water of the sea / but also ye wot well / how many
great flood^^s and Ryuers come and fall in to the Sea / wherefore I demand
and ask as rayson is that mine adversary keep and hold the Ryuers and floodes /
that they enter not in to the sea / And then I shall drink all the see / And
so the paction shall be broken and undone

This historye conteyneth how Exantus excused him from his promise by the
counceylle of Esope

EXantus then knowing / that the Counceylle of Esope was well good / he was
full glad / His Adversary then came before the Cytezeyns of the Cite te
tell and signefye the pactyon and prayed the Judge that Exantus should do that
/ which he had promised to do / And Exantus commanded to all his
servants that they should bear his bed / his table / and all other things
that were necessary to him upon the Ryuage of the sea / And then before all
the company he made a pie (...) to be wassh^^n and filled it full of the water
of the sea / the which he took in his hand / and said to his adversary /
Expose we now / and tell our paction and bargayn / Exantus then turned him
toward the felauship / and said / My lords of Sampe / ye wot well how many
floodes and ryuers enter and come in to the sea / And if mine Adversary will
^^pe and hold them stylle / so that they enter no more in to the sea / I shall
drink all the water of the sea / And all they that were there began then
to say / Exantus says well / And then the Scoler adversary to Exantus said /
My master thou have Wynquysshed me / wherefore I pray the that our bar gain
may be broken / And Exantus said I am content / And when Exantus was turned
again to his house Eso^^e did pray him saying thus / My master by cause I
have served and helped the well in thyn need / let me go f^^ at my lyberte



EXanctus then cursed him / saying / great, head yet shall thou not escape
free ^^e go fro me / goo thou see and behold before the yate / if thou can
aspye two crows to gyder / And then thou come again to tell it me / For
the sight of two crows / one nyghe the other is good fortune / but the sight
of one allone is euylle fortune / And as Esope issued out of the hows / he
saw two crows upon a tree / wherefore de soon turned again / and told it to
his Master / But as Exantus departed out of the hows the one flewe awey /
Then said he / great head / great belly / where ben the two crows that thou
saw / And Esope said thus to him / As I went to fetch the / the one flewgh
awey / And Exantus said / crooked back and euylle shapen / it is ever thus thy
manner to mocque me / but thus shall not thou be quyte / and commanded to
undo his clothes and to beat him / And as men be^^ him / Exantus was called to
his dysner / And then Esope said / Allas / how much miserable I am / For I
ha ue seen two crows to gyder / and am beat / And Exantus which saw but one
is called to the dely^^es / And there is none / to whom the birds ben so
contrary as they are to me / And when exantus herd him / he was much
merueilled of the great subtylyte of his wit / and commanded them that beat
him / that they should ce^^se / And within a little while after Exantus said to
Esope / goo thou / and dress us good metes for our dinner / For all these
lords shall dyne with me / And eso pe went to the market / and bought all
that he would bye / And when it was al ready / he brought the metes in to the
halle / where he found his maystresse lyenge upon a bed slepynge / he awaked
her and said / Madame if it please you / ye shall ta ke head to this mete that
the dogs or cattes ete it not / For I must go in to the kechyn ageyn / And
she ansuerd to him go thou where thou wylt / for my buttokes have eyes / And
when Esope had dressyd and made ready all the other metes / he brought them in to
the halle / and found his maystresse whi che slepte stylle upon her bed h^^r
buttockes toward the table And by cause she had said that her buttokes had eyes
/ Esope went and took up her clothes / so that men might see her (...) (...) /
And thus he left h^^r slepynge /

This Historye conteyneth how Exantus found his wife a^^ discovered /


ANd as Exantus with him his scolers perceived and sa we his wife slepynge / her
buttoks al bare and naked / by great vergoyne and shame turned his face toward
Esope / and said / knave / what is this / And Esope said / My lord / as I did
put the mete upon the table / I prayed my lady that she would keep it fro the
dogs / And she ansuerd me that her buttoks had eyes / And by cause I found
her slepynge / I discovered her so / to the end / that her buttoks might the
better see and look about / And then Exantus said unto him / Ha shrewed
servant often thou have paid me of such lesynges / what thing werse may
thou do to me / but to mock thus my wife and me also / Nevertheless for the
love and sake of these lords thou shall not now be beat / but the time shall
come that I shall make the deye of an euylle death / And within a while after
Exantus said to Esope / keep and look well / that no fools ydeots enter in to
my hows / but only the orators and philosophres / Esope then went / and
set him beside the yate / And as one of the philesophres came to have on tried
in to the hows / Esope began to groygne / and said to him / come in thou
dog / And the philosopher wenynge / that he had mocqued him / al wroth and
angry went fro thens / And thus did many other / But at the last came there
one / which was subtyle enough / to whom Esope did / as he had done to the
other / And he that was wise ansuerd him swetely / And then Esope let him
goo / and enter in to the hows / And anon he went again to his lord And said
to him / No philosopher is come to the yate / but this one / wherefore Exantus
wend that all the other had mocqued with him / and was wroth and angry /

And on the morn as they met with Exantus / they said to him thus / Exantus
well thou mocquest us yesterdaye / For he that kept thy yate castyng on us
ashrewed look did call us dogs / For the which thing Exantus was troubled
and more angry and wroth than to fore he was /

And anon he called Esope / and said to him / goo thou Crokedbacked /
Counterfaytte / and falls Chorle / they whom thou sholdest have received with
worship and greet honor / thou have vitupered and mocked / Esope ansuerd to
him / thou have charged and commanded me that none I should let enter in to
thy hows / but wise and sage philosophres And Exantus said to him / Ha falls
face and crooked / ben not these wise and sage / Nay said Esope / For when I
said that they should enter / they entryd not / but like fools went again
their way without speaking of any word / but this allone ansuerd wisely / And
therefore I repute and hold him as sage / and they as fools / For a fool is he
that lyghtely ta keth any word in anger / And then all the sages and phi
losophres that were there approuued the ansuere of Esope true and good / and
much they were merueylled of the great wisdom / which was in him

This history makes mencyon how Esope found a tresour And how Exantus made him
to be put in prison /


ANd within a little while after / as exantus was with Esope / beholdynge the
greet sepulcres or Tombs / and the Epytaphes of the ancient folk / And
Esope which perceived an arche / which was nyghe of a columpne unto the
which men went up to it by four steps he went thither / and saw sum
lettres without consonaunce or understanding / sauf only by points intytuled
after the manner and form of these lettres which ben latin lettres / A / B / D
O / ct / H / c / H / Esope called his master and said to him / My lord what
bytokenen these lettres / Exantus looked and be held them well / And a long while
he thought what they sygnefyed / And by cause he could not understand the
signyficacion of them / he said to Esope / tell me what these lettres
signefyen / And Esope said to him / My lord if I show the here a fair tresour
/ what reward shall I receive of the / Exantus his master said to him / have
thou a good courage / For I shall give to the fredome and lyberte and the half
of this tresour / And anon Esope went down the four steps / and so deep he
delued at the foot of the columpne / that he found the tresour the which
anon he gaf to his lord and said to him / My lord I pray the that now thou
wylt do to me as thou have promised me / and Exantus said to him / or ever
thou have lyberte and fredome / thou must learn and teache me how thou wost and
know this science / for more I repute and set by the science and hold it
to gretter merueylle / than to have the tresour / Esope said then to him / he
that first put here this tresour as philosophye denotes and specyfyeth it by
the (...) the which ben here wreton in latin / Ascend gradus istos qua tuor
fodias / et inuenies thesaurum auri / And after Exantus told him / Sith thou
art so subtyl / thou shalt not yet have no lyberte / And Esope said to him
Look well what thou do / For this Tresoure apperteyneth to the king / And
Exantus asked of him and said / How know thou hit / By the lettres which
signyfyen to us / that thou give and take to the king Dyonysyus the Tresour
which thou have found / And when Exantus herd him say that the tresour
which they had so found / was apperteynynge to the king Dyonysices / he
said thus to Esope / Take the half of all this Tresoure / and and let no
man know of it / Esope then said to him / thou gyuest it me naught / but he
that put and delued it here / gives it to me / And Exantus said / how know
thou hit And Esope ansuerd to him / For the lett^^ following shown and
signyfyen hit / that is to wete / E / D / Q / I / T / A / the which lettres
signefyen this latin / Euntes dimitte quem inuenistis thesaurum auri / And
then said Exantus / goo we home / and there shall we depart it /

This Historye makes mency on how Esope was delyuerd out of prison / And how
Exantus promised to him that he should give him fredome and lyberte


ANd as Exantus was turned again in to his how fro the place where as esope
had found the tresour in the tresour before seid he merueiled of the wysedom yt
was in Esope / but for the lyberte and fredome which he demanded he was
woothe and angry / And dredyng the tongue of Esope made him to be put fast in
prison / And Esope said to him / This is a fair promise of a philosopher /
thou know well / how thou promysest to me lyberte / And instead of fredome
and lyberte I am put in prison / And as Exantus herd him so speak he revoked
and ^^unged his sentence / and made him to be delyuerd / And after he said to
Esope / if thou wylt be put to thy lyberte / hold thy tongue in peace / and
accuse me no more / And Esope said / do what pleases the / For wylt thou or not
thou shall put me to my lyberte / That same time be fell a merueyllous deed
within the Cite of Samye / For as men played there the common and publyk plays /
as yet at this time is custom to do in many good Cytees / An Egle soden ly
flewhe thorugh all the communyte of the people / and took and ^^ure awey with
him the ring and the Seal of him that soueraynly had the might and puyssaunce
of all the Cite / And let it fall in to the pytte of a man which was in
lyberte / For the which deed and token all the people of Samye was gretely
meruaylled / And then arose a great rumor thorugh the Cite among the people /
For much they were doubtuous of some persecucion / and wist not what that thing
might signefye / where fore they were in great doubt and in great henynesse /
And there for Incontinent they came toward Exantus / as to him which they held
for the most sage and wise man of all the cite of Samye / and demanded of him
what this meruaylle sygnyfyed / and also what thing might befalle thereof /
Exantus was ygnoraunt / and knew not the signyfycacion of this merueyll /
wherefore he demanded of the people time and space for to give herupon an
ansuere / Exantus then was in great heaviness and dolor by cause he wist not
what he should say / ne ansuere to the people / And Esope which saw him so
heavy / and full of sorrow / demanded of him and said / why art thou so heavy
in thy courage / leave sorrow / and take with the Joy and gladness / give to
me the charge for to ansuere to the Samyens / And to morn thou shall say to
them such words / My lords of Samye / I am no dynyn ne Interpretour of the
merueyllous things which ben to come / Netheles I have a servant in my hows /
which as he says can tell such things / if it please you I shall make him
come befo re you / And then if by my cou^ceyll I satisfye all the felau ship
/ thou shall therefore receive and have worship glory and prouf fyt / And if I
can not satisfye them / thou shall be delyuerd of great Infamye and shame / And
I shall be rebuked and put to great shame / Then Exantus having his trust
in the words of Esope went on the morrow in to the great place of Samye / and
assembled there the people of the Cite and went up on high where as the Judge
was acustomed to sytte / and that which he had learned of his servant Esope /
he declared there before the Samyens / the which things by him reherced and
said / / prayed him that he would make his servant to come thither before them /
Esope came anon thither / And as he was before all the company / all the people
of the Samyens looked and byheld him with great merueyll / by cause he was so
co^^fayted and crosted of body / and said / look here ^^s a fair person able
to be a sewre dyuyn / and went and mocked with him / And Esope being then
on the highest party of ass the place / began to make a token or sign with
his hand unto the people of the Samyens / to the end / that they should hold
their peace and keep scylence among them / And said do them in this manner / My
lords for what cause lawghe you and scorn me of my figure and form / and
know ye not that men must not look in the face of a man to see and byhold of
what figure or form that he is of / but only to know his wysedom Also men
ought not to look and take heed to the vessel / but to such thing as is within
the vessel / For often a foul vessel is full of good wyn / And then when the
Samyens herd these words / they said to Esope / If thou can give us good
counceylle for the welthe of all the common people / we al pray the that thou
wylt do it anon / And then Esope having confydence and trust in his
wisdom and science / said thus / Nature or kind of the which comes all good
/ has this day set and put debute or stryf bitwene the lord and the servant
/ for he that shall wynquysshe shall not be paid ne rewarded after his desserte
/ for if the lord get the victory I that am his servant shall have no lyberte
/ as ryt requires / but I shall be beat and cursed / and also emprysoned /
wherefore if ye will / that I give you good enseygneme^t of that that ye demand
and ask I requy re you that ye do make me free and be put ageyn in to my
lyberte to the end that with trust and good co^fydence I may speak to you And I
promyt and enseure you that I shall show unto you the sygnyfycacion and
understanding of this angry or sign / and then they al with an egal wys
said / he axeth thing reasonable and Just / wherefore exa^tus shall make him to
be free as reason is / the which thing exantus reffused to do / And the lord
of the auctoryte publyke said unto him / Exantus if thou wyl^^ not obey to the
people by the virtue of mine auctoryte / I shall take him out of thy seruytude and
shall humble thy self in the tem ple of Iunoys

This historye following makes mencyon / hou esope was restitued into his
lyberte


ANd by cause that exantus was required and prayed by all his good friends that
he should restore and put esope in to lyberte / he said to Esope / hou be hit
that it is not by my good will I give the lyberte / And anon he thatmade them
the cries and proclamacions went in to all the places wh^^ such cries were
done / Exantus the philosopher has given lyberte to Esope / And thus was
acoomplysshed that / what esope had said / will ye or will you not / I shall ones
be put in to lyberte / And then Esope went in to the mids of all the
folauship / and made sign with his hand that every one should keep pees (...)
scyl^^nte / And after said to them / My lords of Sa mye / the Aygle which is
king above al other birds / As the kings ben* above the people has take awey
the ring and scal of your perfect or governor / This bytokeneth / and
sygnefyeth / that a king shall demand and axe your lyberte / and shall
destroy all your laws / And when the Samyens herd the words / they wexed
and became al abusshed and sore aferd And anon after came a pursyuaunt or
messager / which brought with him Royal lettres / the which demanded after
the (...) of the Samyens / this messager was brought before the coun^^ylle of
the town / to whom he presented and took his l^^e^s in the which was
contained that which followed / Cressus king of lyndye^^s / To the Senate and
common people of Samye antynge / I command you that ye do to me obeyssounce
and that ye pay to me my tr^^butes / the which thing if ye reffuse it to
fulfill and do / I shall put you ^^l to death and br^^ne your town / the
which lettres seen and read / the samyens were al a^^ssded / and for dread
were enclyned and wyllyng to obey unto him Nevertheless they would know and
have the coun^^ylle of esope and pr^^id him to say thereof his sentence / the
which went and set him in the syege / and said to them My lords of Samye /
how be (...) / that I will / that ye be enclyned to oleye the king of lyndye /
Nevertheless to the end that I may counceylle you that whi che is nedeful and
couenable for the publyke welthe and prouffyt I do you to know / that fortune
in this mortal life shows ii things and two manners of ways / The one is
lyberte whereof the beginning is bard / and dyffy^^yle / but the end of hit is
good sweet and facyle / The other way is seruytude / whereof the beginning is
facyle / but the end thereof is sharp / full bitter and hard / And when the
samyens herd these words knowing what it behooves to the publyk and common
welthe / beh^^ld and took aduys of the sentence of Esope / And said al to gydre
Because that we be in lyberte / we will not be servant to no man / And with
this ansuere sent again the Messager to Cressus / And when the king herd this
ansuere / he was wroth and sorrowful / and gadred al his men of werre / and also
all the nobles and gentyls of his reame / and made a great armee for to have
destroyed the Samyens / the which thing he might well have brought about had
not be his messager / which said to him / Right dear Sire and my sovereign
lord / thou may not be aue^gyd of the Samyens as long as they have Esope
with them which in all their affairs and need helps and counceylleth them /
wherefore hit is necessary that thou send an ambassade unto the Samyens / that
they will send to the Esope / and that thou shall pardonne and forgive to them
their offense / For if thou may have Esope / they of Samye ben in thyn hand /
And the king suddenly sent an ambassade to them of Samye / the which
Ambassatours applyqued and set their wits to show unto the Senate of
Samye the will of their lerd Cressus / and said that they should send Esope to
the lord Cressus / And when Esope understood what the king demanded / he said
to the Samyens / My lords It pleases me well to go toward the king But er I go
thither I will tell you a fable

This historye makes mention / how the wolves sent ambassa^^ours unto the
Sheep

IN a time when the bestes could speak the wolves ma de werre against the sheep
/ And by cause that the sheep might not keep them ne hold against the wolves
they demanded help of the dogs / the which fyghtyng for the sheep made the
wolves to torn them backward / And by cause the wolves could ne might not get
ne have any pro ye ne win nothing upon the sheep for the love of the dogs
that kept the sheep / the wolves sent an Ambassade unto the sheep for to have
perpetuel pees with them / And for to ha ue pees / the wolves went and
demanded that for to esche we al suspecion / the dogs should be taken to the
wolves / or else destroyed for ever / And the sheep as fools and for to have
good pees consented to this demand / And when the dogs were slain / the
wolves took vengeance on the sheep as ap pyereth / when Esope had
reherced this fable / the Samyens determined in them self that Esope should not
go toward the king

This historye couteyneth / how Esope obeyed not to the samyens / but went
toward the king


ESope obeyed not to the will of the Samyens / but went with the Ambassade
toward the king / And when he was come in to the kings Court / the king
seeing that Esope was so gretely disformed and cou^terfaite of body / he was
wroth and angry with him self / And said as by great merueylle is the same he
/ for the trust of whom / they of Samye will not obey to me / Esope then
said / Haryght dear sire and king magnysyke / certainly I am not come before
thy mageste by force / but of my good will I am comen to the / trusting so
much of thy benygnyte / that thou shall here what I sha^^e say to the / The
king gafe him audyence and leave to say what he would / and thus he said / that
other day was a man which chaced the flies / the which man took a
nyghtyngale / the which seeing that he wol de have killed her / prayed to the
fawkoner / saying / I pray the that without cause thou wylt not slay me /
For to no body I do no harm ne damage / For I ete not the corn / ne with my
horns I hurt no body / but give solas and Joy to all them that gone by the
way of my song and boys / and in me shall thou find but only the boyce / And
when the Faukoner herd these words he let goo her / wherefore right dear Sire
I pray the that without cause / I which am naught / and as nothing / thou
wylt not slay me / For to no body I do no harm / ne also would I do / And for
the debylyte and feblenesse of my body I may naught do / but I can speak and
say things which ben profitable to them that been in the mortal life of this
present world / The king was then merueylled and moved of pity and of
myserycorde said to Esope / I gy ue not to the thy life / but fortune gives it
to the / And if thou wylt have any thing of me / / ask hit / and hit shall be
grau^ ted / and given to the / And Esope said Right dear Sire only one thing I
demand of the / that is to wete / that thou give me the trybutes of the
Samyens / well said the king I am content / Then kneled Esope and said to the
king / Sire I thank and regracye you much / And after that he com posed the
fables which ben wr^^ton in this book / and to the king he gaf them / And
demanded of him the lettres of the gift for the remyssion of the trybutes of
the Samyens / the which he delyuerd to him by the kings commandment / and
with his good will with many other great yeftes / And Eso pe then took leave of
the king / and to Samye he returned when Esope was arrived in to Samye / the
Samyens received him worshipfully / and made great Joy of his coming / And
Esope commanded to the people to be assembled to gyder at a certain hour in
to the common place / Then went Esope and set him in the syege and recyted
and read the Royal lettres / how the king Crossus remytted and forgaf to them
the trybutes / After this Esope departed fro Samye / and would goo to disporte
him self thorugh many regyons / nations and Cyt^^es gyuynge enseygnementes / by
histo ryes and fables to the mortal men / He came to Babyloyne / And by cause
he did show there his sapyence / he was well received / and worshipfully
festyed of Sycurre king of babyloyne / And at that time the kings did send
the one to the other plays and proposycions problematyks / and such other
playsaunces for their disportes / And he which could not interpret them /
sent trybute to him that sended them / And by cause that Esope could well
interpret them taught to the king of Babyloyne the manner of hit / And syn he
composed there many fables which the king of Babyloyn sent to other kings /
And by cause they could not interpret them they fen ce many trybutes to the
king of Babyloyne / wherefore the royalme was eslargysshed and filled of many
great Rychesses / And after that by cause Esope had no children / he adopted a
noble and young child to his sone / the which he presen ted to the king / And
he received him as he had be his own sone / which child was named Enus / This
Enus within a little while after / meddled with the chamberere of Esope which he
held for his wife / and knew her bodyly / And by cause he was in great doubt
that Esope would avenge him he accused Esope toward the king of crime of
lezemageste or treason / and composed falls lettres showing by them to the
king / how by the fables which he sent here and thither he had bytrayd him
/ and that he had conspyred his death



This Historye makes mencyon / how the king commanded that Esope should be
put in his first dygnyte and office And how he pardonned / and forgaf to his
adopted sone /

THe king Lycurius byleuynge and gyuyng credence to the accusacion maade
ageynste Esope was gretely wroth / And commanded to Herope his Seneschalle
that Esope should be put to death / And Herope seeing / that this sentence was
not Just / kept Esope secretly within a sepulcre / And all his goods were
confysked to his sone which had accused him / And within a long while after /
Nectana bus which was king of Egypt wenynge that Esope had be put to death
/ as the common renomme or talking was sent a proposycion problematyke to
Lycurre king of babyloyne / the which conteyneth this that follows /
Nectanabus king of Egypt / to Lycurre king of Babyloyne gretynge / By cause
that I will edyffye or byld a tower / the which shall not touch heaven ne
earth / I pray the. that thou wylt send me massons for to make up the said
Toure / And this prayer by the accomplysshed / I shall give to the ten
trybutes of al my Reame and lands / And when the king of Babyloyne herd this
demand / he was gretely troubled and wroth / and thought how he might
satisfye and give an ansuere to this question / And then he called to him al
his sages for to have the solucion of the said question / And by cause that
none conde make the soluaon / the king was more angry than to fo re / And for
the great sorrow that he took hereof he felt down to the ground / and said
Allas I am well miserable and my; schannt / that have lost the crown of my
Royalme / cursed be he by whom I made Esope to be put to death / And then
when Herope the Seneschall knew the great anguysshe and sorrow of the king /
he said to him / Right dear Sire take nomor^^ sorrow ne afflyction in thyn
heart / but pardone and forgive me / For I made not Esope to be put to death /
as thou commaundest me / For well I wyste that yet thou sholdest have need of
him / And doubting to do against thy mageste / syn that time unto this day /
I have kept him in a sepulcre / And when the king herd these words / he
wexed full of Iope / And anon rose fro the ground where as he lay / and went
and enbraced his Seneschall / saying / if hit be so that Esope may be yet on
live / during my life I shall be bound to the / And therefore I pray the / if
hit be so / let him come to me anon / Esope was brought before the king /
which fill down to the kings feet / And when the king saw that Esope was
so pale and afflyged / he had of him pity / and com maunded or bid that he
should be taken up / and clothed of new / And when Esope was upon his feet /
he came before the king / and full mekely salewed him / And demanded of him
the cause why he had been put in prison / And the king said to him / that his
adopted sone Enus had accused him And then the king commanded / that Enus
should be punysshed of such pain / of the which ought to be punysshed they
that make their faders to deye / But Esope prayed the king that he would
forgive him / And then the king showed to Esope the question of the king of
Egypt / And when Esope had seen the lettres he said to the king / write and
send again this sentence to the king of Egypt / gyuynge to him this ansuere
/ that after the winter shall be passed and gone / thou shall send unto him
werkmen for to byld and make up his toure / and for to ausuere to him in all
things / And thus he sent his Ambussatours to the king of Egypt / After
this the king made all the goods of egypt After this the king made all the
goods of Esope to be restytued unto him / and to be put in his first dygnyte
gyuyng to him auctoryte and might to punysshe his sone after his will / But
Esope benygnely received again in to his own hows his adopted sone / and
swetely chastysed and corryged him / and said to him / My sone keep thou my
comaundeme^ts and take and put them in to thy courage / For we give well
counceylle to other / but for us we can not take hit / And by cause that thou
art an humayne man thou must be subgette to fortune / And therefore thou shall
first love god / and shall keep thy self fro the wrath and anger of thy king
/ And by cause that thou art an humayne man have then cure and sollycitude
of humayne things / For god punyssheth the evil and wicked folk / and also
it is not heavenly thing to do to any body any harm / but show thy self
cruel to thyn enemies to the end that of them thou be not condampned / And to
thy friends make ioyefull semblaunt and good there / to the end that thou may
have ever the sooner their help and good will / For thou ought to desire
and wysshe prosperyte and welfare to all thy friends / and aduersyte to all
thyn enemies / Thou must speak fair to thy wife / to the end that she take none
other man / For by cause a woman is much varyable and meuable / as men flatere
and speak fair to her / she then (...) ne is less enclyned to do any euylle
/ keep the well fro the felauship of a man to much cruel / For how be hit that
he have good prosperyte yet he is miserable / Stop thyn eres / and keep and
hold well thy tongue / keep the fro much talking / And have not envy of other
men's good / For envy lets the enuyous / Have cure and regard over thy
famylle or mey ny / and that thou be loved like a lord / Have shame in thy self
to do against reason / And be not neclygent or recheles to learn every day /
Tell not thy counceylle to thy wife in no wise / Spend and wast not thy good
wylfully / For better is to a man to leave his goods after his death / than to
be indy* gent and a beggar in his life / Salewe or great Ioyously such as thou
mete by the way / For the dog makes with his taylle feast and chere to them
that he knows by the way Mo^^e no body / And never ^^sse thy wit to
sapyence And all that thou ^^west yield it again with good will to thence that
men lene to the another time with good will And they which thou may well
^^lpe / refuse them not / Keep the fro euylle company / And thyn affairs or
be synes sh^^we unto thy Friends / And beware that thou do nothing. whereof
thou may repent the after / And when aduersyte shall come on the / bear
it pacyently / Lodge and her^^owe them that been unpurveyed of lodges / A good
word is medicine against the vy^^ / Certainly he is well happy that may get to
him a good friend / For nothing is so secretly ^^epte / but that ones it is
known and manyfested /

This Historye makes mention / how Enus departed f^^ ^^ope and killed him self


And after many admonestementes and techynges E^^s the sone of Esope departed
fro the company of Esope seeing that Iniustly and without ^^use he had accused
him / He was full of heaviness and sorrowful / and went up to the top of a
high montayne / And fro thens he did cast him self down to the foot of the
hylle / And thus wylfully he brake his bones / and kyld him self / as he that
ever had kept euylle rewle and mysgouernaunce / For of euylle life follows
euylle end / After this Esope commanded to the Faukeners that they should take
four young egles which were yet within their nest / And when Esope had
them / he acustomed and taught them for to ete their mete high and low / and
each of them had to their feet two children fasted and bounden / and as the
children lift upward or ma de their mete to come dounward / the young egles in
like wise flough up and down for to take their mete / And these things thus
dressyd and made / and that the winter was gone and pas sed / Esope took his
leave of the king ^^ycurre / and with his Egles and children went in to Egypt
/ And when Esope arrived and came before the king of Egypt / the king
seeing that Esope was Crokedbucked and counterfayted of bo die / thought in him
self that he was but a be / and that the king of Babyloyne mocqued him and
his person / For he considered not that a foul vessel may be full of right
good wyn / For men must not only take heed to the vessel / but to that which
is in hit / Esope then kneled before the king and much humbly he salewed
him / And the king syttyng in his mageste received him right graciously and
benyngly / saying to him in this manner / how lykest thou me and the mine / And
Esope ansuerd Sire thou lykest and semest to me to be the son / and thy men
the sparks of hit /

This Historye makes mention how Esope rendryd the solucion to the king of
Egypt upon the question / which he sent to the king of Babyloyne /


When the king herd the ansuere of Esope / (...) was much merueylled of
that he was so subtyle in his an suere / and said to him in this manner / Have
thou brought with the all them which shall edyffye and make up my Tour / y^^
said Esope / but first thou must show to me the pla (...) where as thou will
have it / ^^he king then departed out of his palace / and led Esope in to
a fair fold / and said / See thou this fair feld / It is the place where I
will have my toure edyffyed /

Esope then to each corner of this feld leyd an Egle with ^^o children / The
child held then the mete upward in to the a^^r / and the egles began to
flee after hit / And then the Children with a high wys began to cry /
saying / bring now to us claye stones and bryk / wood and tye^^ for to have
byld up the toure / And when the king saw this / he said to Esope as by great
admyracion. how said he / have ye men in your land which have wings / And
Esope said / many such one we have there / Then said the king to Esope /
thou have wynquysshed me by thy reasons and worcester des / But I pray the and
require / that thou wylt ansuere to me upon a questyon which is this / I have
maade mares to be brought to me out of Greece / the which conceyue^^ and bear
horses by the help of the horses / that been in Babyloyne / And Esope then
ansuerd to him / Sire / to morn I shall give to the an ansuere upon this
question /

And after that Esope was returned in to his lodgys / said in this manner to
his servant / Make ye so among you all that ye get me a great Catte / And
the servants accomplys shed the commandment of Esope / Esope then openly
before all the folk maade the Catte to be beat with rods / And as the
Egypcyans saw this / they ran anon after the said catte for to have take him
/ but they might not the which faytte or deed the Egypciens went and showed
it to the king / And anon the king commanded that Esope should be brought to
fore his person /

And when he was before his mageste / the k^^ng said to him / Esope come
hyder / what have thou done / wos^^e thou well that the god which is adoured
and worshypped of us / is of such figure and likeness as a catte / For
certeynly all the Egypcyens worshyppeth the ydolle maade after the form and
figure of a catte / wherefore gretely thou haste offended / And Esope said thus
to the king / Sire this false and euylle be / on the night last passyd
offended gretely against the king of Babyloyne

For this be has slain a Cok which be much loved by cau se he fought
strongly / And sange on all the hours of the nyt And the king then said to
him / Esope I had never byleuyd that thou sholdest have mad so great a
lesynge before me / For hit may not be that this catte should have gone and
come on a night fro hens to Babyloyne /

And esope smylyng said to him / Sire in such manner comes and goth fro
Babyloyne hither the horses of Babyloyn by the which thy marys / brought out
of greece couceyuen and be re young horses / And then after these words said
by Esope / the king preysed gretely the sapyence of Esope / And the king made
more of him and more worshipped him than he did to fore / And on the next
mo^^we the king of Egypt made all the best and grettest philosophres and wise
men of all his Country to be called before him / the which he infourmed of
the great subtylyte (...) wit of Esope / And commanded them to come to
souper in to his Court with Esope / And as they were sitting at the table /
the one of them said thus to Esope / Thou must pardonne me / For here I am
se^^te to speak with the / And Esope ansuerd to him Say what hit pleases to
the / It is not / God is will that no man should make any lesynge / wherefore
your words shown / that lytylle ye dread and love your god / For ye talk
and say but fables and lesynges / And after another said to him / there is a
great Temple in the which is a Columpne / right great / the which Columpne
bears and susteyneth xij / Cytees / And every Cite is couerd with thyrtty
great saylles upon the which two wymmen ben ever rennynge / And Esope ansuerd
to him in this manner / The small and ly till children of Babyloyne know the
solucion of this questyon / For thie Temple whereof thou spekest is the heaven /
and the columpne is the earth / And the twelve Cytees ben the twelve months
of the year / and the thyrtty sayllys ben the days of the months / And by
the two wymmen which ever without cesse run over the thyrtty saylles / is
to under stand the day and night / Then said the king of egypt to the
lords of his Court / Hit is now right and reason / that I send trybutes and
yeftes unto the king of Babyloyne / And one of them said to the king / Sire we
must yet make to him another question / the which is this what is hit / that
we never herd ne never we saw / And the king then began to say to Esope
/ I pray the to give solucion of this question And Esope returned in to his
lodges and feigned to make an oblygacion / In the which Esope made to be wreton
this which follows / I Nectanabus king of Egypt know before all men to
have borrowed of the king Lycurre a thousand mark of gold / the which I
Nectanabus king of Egypt promytte to render hit and pay to the said king
Lycurre within a certain term / which as then was passed / the whi che
Cyrographe or writing Esope presented on the morn so lowynge to the king of
Egypt / Gretely was the king esmerneylled of this Cyrographe / And said to
the noble men of his Court which were there present / Have you ever seen ne
herd say that the king Lycurre had lent to me any mo ney ne other thing /
And the knights sayden Nay / Esope then said to them / if hit be as ye say
to me / your question is assoylled / For now ye have herd and seen that /
which ye herd ne saw never / And then the king of Egypt said that the
king Lycurre was well happy and eurous to ha ue in his might and subjection
such a subget and servant / as Esope was / And sent again Esope in to
Babyloyne / with great yeftes and trybutes for the king of Babyloyne /

This Historye makes mencyon how Esope returned in to Babyloyn / And how for
to make him to be worshipped he did do make a statue or image of gold

THan Esope was come before the king of Babyloyn he told and reherced to him
all that he had done in Egypt / wherefore the king commanded / that in the
worship of Esope a statue or image of gold should be set in the publyke or
common place / And within a while after eso pe had desire and will for to goo
in to greece / and asked leave of the king for to goo thither / whereof the king
was soroufull And Esope promised to him that he should ret^^rne in to Babyloyne
/ And that there he would live and deye with him / And thus the king granted
him leave / And as Esope was going and walkyng through all the cytees

THe which thing Esope denied and agaynsayd / And then the Delphyns
vnbynded the male in the which they found the Coup of gold / And then went
and showed it before the people / And considering and seeing the way of their
malice and wykkednes also knowing that he might not escape began to weep /
and to make sorrow on his fortune / And one of his friends named demas as he
saw Esope thus weeping / comforted him saying Have good courage and rejoice
thy self / And anon the delphyns went and concluded to gyder / that they as a
sacrylege worthy to receive vylaynous death / should take Esope and make him to
be led upon a high Montayne / for to be there thrown down fro the top of
the hylle unto the foot of hit / When Esope knew their sentence / he said
to them and reherced this fable for to withdraw them out of their malice /
and said that pees was among all beestes / the ratte and the frogge loved
much each other / And the Ratte called the frogge for to come and soupe with
him / The ratte said to the frogge / ete of that which pleases to the / And
as they had enough / the frogge said to the Ratte / come with me / and thou
shall be well festyed at souper / And to the end that thou may the better
pass the River / thou shall bynd thy self to my foot / The ratte was bound to
the frogs feet / And anon the frogge lepte in to the water / and drew the
Rat after her / And as the Ratte was nyghe drowned he said to the frogge /
wrongly thou make me suffer death / but they that shall abide on live /
shall avenge this mysdede on the / And as they were thus drawing the one
forward and the other backward A kyte seeing this stryf and delate / took them
both to gyder / and ete them / And semblably ye make me to deye wrongfully /
But Babyloyne and greece shall avenge me upon you / But yet for all this the
Delphyns let not goo Esope / but instead of death they drew and polled him
shrewdly / and the best wise that he could he deffended and revenged him self
against them

This History^^ makes mencyon how Esope ended and (...)


ANd as Esope was thus fighting against them / he escaped out of their hands
and fled in to the Tem ple of Appollo / but all that prouffited him nothing
For by force and strength they had and drew him out of the Temple / And
then they led him where as they would have him for to be put to death / And
Esope seeing him so Vytu pered said to them in this manner / My lords dread
you not your god Appollo shall avenge me upon you / but not withstondynge all
that he could say he was brought to the place where he should deye / And
seeing that he could not escape fro them / he began to reherce to them this
fable / A woman was ones the which had a daughter which was vyrgyne and fool
/ The mother prayed often to the gods / that they would give to her daughter
wit and raysen / her daughter was ones with her in the Temple / and herd what
she said in her prayer / And as this maid was ones gone in to the feldes / she
saw a man which filled a sak full of cor^^ (...) how the delphyns had put
Esope to death / they came to Delph^^e for to punysshe them which had Iniustly
and myserably put Esope to death /

Here begins the preface or prologue of the first book of Esope

I Romulus sone of thybere of the Cite of Alyque / gretyng / Esope man of greece
/ subtyle and Ingenyous / techeth in his fables how men ought to keep and rewle
them well / And to the end that he should show the life and customs of al manner
of men he induces the birds / the trees and the beestes speaking to the end
that the men may know wherefore the fables were found / In the which he has
wreton the malice of the euylle people and the argument of the Improbes / He
techeth also to be humble and for to use words / And many other fair Ensamples
reherced and declared here after / the which I Romulus have translated out of
grekez tongue in to latin tongue / the which if thou read them / they sha^^e
aguyse and sharp thy wit and shall give to the cause of Joy /

The third fable is of the rat / and of the frogge /

NOw it be so / that as the rat went in pylgremage / he came by a River / and
demanded help of a frogge for to pass / and go over the water / And then
the frogge bound the rats foot to her foot / and thus swymed unto the mids
over the River / And as they were there the frogge stood stylle / to the end
that the rat should be drowned / And in the mean while came a kyte upon them /
and both (...) them with him / This fable made Esope for a symplytude which
is profitable to many folks / For he that thinks euylle against good / the
euylle which he thinks shall ones (...) upon him self

The fourth fable is of the dog and of the sheep
OF the men chalengynge / which ever be seeking occasi on to do some harm
and dommage to the good / says Esope such a fable / Sometime was a dog /
which demanded of a sheep a loof of bread that she had wrowed of him / And
the sheep ansuerd that never she had none of him The dog made her to come
before the Judge / And by cause the sheep denied the debt / the dog prouysed

vaynquysshed / And then the Judge commanded to her that she should pay the
dog / wherefore she sold awey before the winter her flees and wulle for to
pay that / that she never had / And thus was the ponre sheep despoylled / In

The viij fable is of the wulf and of the crane
WHo so ever does any good to the evil man he synneth as esope says / for of
any good which is don to the evils comes no prouffit / whereof Esope reherceth
to us such a fall / A wulf ete and devoured a sheep of whose bones he had one
in his throat which he could not have out and sore it grieved him Then went
the wulf and praid the crane that she would draw out of his throat the bone /
and the crane put her nest in to his through te and drew out the bone whereby the

And the crane demanded of him to be paid of her salary / And the wulf answered
to her / Thou art well vnco^nyng and no good connyng / remembryng the good
that I ha ue done to the / for when thou had thy neck within my throat / if
I had would / I might have ete the / And thus it appiereth by the fable how no
prouffite comes of any good which is do ne to the euyls



and with great pain he might hold his courage / to have forth with devour or
him / But the lion said to him self / It be^^ ueth not that trethe so noble
and so fair as mine be touche^^ not / ^^e byten such a foul be / For he
that is wise must not hurt the fool ne take heed to his words / but let him
go for such as he is

The xij fable is of the two rats

BEtter worth is to live in pouerte surely / than to live rychely be n^^t ever
in danger / whereof Esope tells such a fable / There were two rate / whereof
the one was great and fater / and held him in the celer of a Rich man And the
other was pour and lene / On a day this great and fat ratte went to sport
him in the feldes and met by the way the pour rat / of the which he was
received as well as he could in his pour cauerne or hole / and gaf him of
such mete as he had / Then said the fat ratte come thou with me / And I
shall give the well other metes / He went with him in to the town / and entered
both in to the celer of the rich man / the which celer was full of all
goods / And when they were within the great rat presented and gaf to the pour
rat of the delycious metes / saying thus to him / Be merry and make good chere /

place came in to the celer / and the great rat fled anon in to his hole / and
the pour rat wist not whyther he should goo ne flee / but hyd him behynd the
door with great fere and dread / and the ^^uteler turned again and saw him
not / And when he was gone the fat rat came out of his cauerne or hole / and
called the pour ratte / which yet was shaking for fore / and said to him /
come hyder and be not aferd / and ete as much as thou will / And the pour rat
said to him / for gods love let me go out of this celer / For I ha ue lever
ete some corn (...) the feldes and live surely / than to be ever in this
torment / for thou art here in great doubt and lyuest not surely / And
therefore hit is good to live pourely and surely For the pour lives more
surely than the rich (...)

if thou had the wys clear and small thou sholdest be the most happy of al
other birds / And the fool which herd the flaterynge words of the fox
began to open his bylle for to sing / And then the chese fylle to the
ground / and the fox took and ete hit / And when the raven saw that for his
wyn glory he was deceived wexed heavy and sorrowful / And (...) him of that he
had byleued the fox / And this fable (...) us / how men ought not to be glad
ne take reioysshynge in the words of caytyf folk / ne also to leave flatery ne
wyn glory

The xvj fable is of the lion / of the wyld bore / of the bole and of the ass

When a man has lost his dignyte or office / he must leave his first
audacyte or hardynes / to the end / that he be not iniuryed and mocqued of every
one / Whereof Esope shows unto such a fable / There was a lion which in his
yongthe was fyers and much outragyous / And when he was come to his old age /
there came to him a wyldbore / which with his teeth ^^nt and hirst a great
pyece of his body and avenged upon him of the wrong that the lion had do to
him before that time / After came to him the boole whicha smote and hnrted him
with his horns / And an ass came there / which smote him in the forhede with
his feet by ma ner of vyndycacion / And then the pour Lion began to weep
saying within him self in this manner / when I was young and virtuous every
one doubted and fered me / And now that I am old and feeble / and nyghe to my
death / none is that sets ne holds ought by me / but of every one I am
setten a back / And by cause that now I have lost both virtue and strength /
I have lost all good and worship / And there fore this fable admonesteth many
one which ben enhaunced in dygnyte and worship showing to them / how they
must be meke and humble / For he that geteth and acquyreth no friends ought to
be doubtous to fall in such caas and in such peryls

The xvij fable is of the ass and of the young dog

The xix fable is of the mylan which was seek and of his mother

HE that ever does euylle ^^ught not to supp^^se ne ^^ue no trust that his

such a fa^^ / Of a mylan which was sek^^ / so much that be had no trust to
rec^^uere hi^^ health / And as (...) saw him so vexed with feebleness / he prayed
his mother that she should pray unto the godd^^s for him / And his mother ansuerd
to him / My sone thou ^^ast so gretely offendyd and blas^^hemyd the gods that
now they wol avenge them on the / For thou prayest not them by pity ne by love
/ but for dolor and dread / For he which led^^ euylle life / and that in his
euylle delynge is obstynate / ought not to have hope to be delyuerd of his
evil / For when one i^^ fall in to extremyte of his sekenes / then is the
time come that he must be paid of his works and deeds / For he that offends
other in his prosperyte / when he falls in to aduersyte / he fyndeth no
friends /

The xx fable makes mention of the swalowe / and other birds

HE that byleueth not good cou^ceyll / may not fayll to be euylle counceylled /
whereof Esope reherceth to us such a fable / of a plowgh man / which sowed
lynseed / and the swalowe seeing that of the same lynseed men might make nets
and gynnes / went and said to all other birds / Come with me ye al and let
us pluck up all this / For if we leave hit grow / the labourer shall mow make
thereof gynnes and nets for to take us al / All the birds dispraysed his
counceyl And then as the swalowe saw this / he went and herberowed her in
the plowgh man's hows / And when the


frogs had great dread and fered much / And after they ap proched to their
king for to make obeyssaunce unto him / And when they perceived that hit was
but a pyece of wood / they tyrned again to Jupiter prayenge him swetely that
he would give to them another king / And Jupiter gaf to them the He^^n for to
be their king / And then the Heron began to enter in to the water / and
ete them one after other / And when the frogs saw that their king
destroyed / and ete them thus / they began tendyrly to weep / saying in this
manner to the god Jupiter / Right high and right mighty god Jupiter please the
to delyuere us fro the throat of this dragon and falls tyrant which eteth us
the one after another / And he said to them / the king which ye have
demanded shall be your master / For when men have that / which men ought to
have / they ought to be ioyeful and glad And he that has lyberte ought to keep
hit well / For nothing is better than lyberte / For lyberte should not be well
sold for all the gold and silver of all the world

The second fable is of the Columbes or douues of the kyte and of the
sperehawke /

WHo that put and submytteth him self under the save guard or protection of
the euylle / thou ought to wete and know / that when he asks and
demanded aid and help / he geteth none / whereof Esope reherceth to us such
a fable / Of the douues which demanded a sperehawke for to be their king /
for to keep them fro the kyte or mylan / And when the sperehawke was maade
king over them / he began to devour them / the which columbes or douues
said among them / that better it were to them do suffer of the kyte than to be
under the subjection of the sperehawke / and to be martred as we be / but
thereof we be well worthy / For we our self ben cause of this meschyef / And
therefore when men done any thing / men ought well to look and consydere
the end of hit / For he does prudently and wisely which takes good head to
the end

The fyfthe fable makes mencyon of the Montayn which shoke

Right so it happeth / that he that menaceth has dread and is ferdfull /
whereof Esope reherceth to us such a fable Of a hylle which began to tremble
and shake by cause of the molle which delued hit / And when the folk saw
that the earth began thus to shake / they were sore aferd and dredeful / and
durst not well come ne approach the hylle / (...) after when they were come
nyghe to the Montayne / and knew how the molle caused this hylle shaking /
their doub te and dread were converted unto Joy / and began all to lawhe /
And therefore men ought not to doubt al folk which ben of great words and
menaces / For sum menacen that ha ue great doubt

The vj fable is of the wulf and of the lamb

THe birth causes not so much to get some friends / as does the goodness /
whereof Esope reherceth to us such a fable / Of a wulf which saw a lamb
among a great herd of gootes / the which lamb sowked a got / And the wulf
went and said to him / this got is not thy mother / goo and seek her at the
Montayn / for she shall nourysshe the more swetely and more tendyrly than this
got shall / And the lamb ansuerd to him / This goote nouryssheth me instead
of my mother / for she leneth to me her pappes sooner than to any of her own
children / And yet more / hit is better for me to be here with these gootes
than to depart fro hens / and to fall in to thy throat for to be devoured /
And therefore he is a fool which leueth fredome or surete / for to put him
self in great peril and danger of death / For better is to live surely and
rudely in sewrte than swetely in peril and da^^ And as they ran / they
adressyd them in to a medowe fulle of frogs / And when the frogs herd the
hares run they began also to flee and to run fast / And then a hare
which perceived them so ferdfull said to all his felawes / Let us no more be
dredeful ne doubtuous / for we be not alone that have had dread / For all the
frogs ^^n in doubt / and have fere and dread as we have / Therefore we ought
not to despayr^^ / but have trust and hope to live / And if sum aduersyte
comes upon us / we must bear it pacyently / For ones the time shall come that
we shall be out of pain and out of all dread / Therefore in the unhappy and
Infortunat time men ought not be despayred / but ought ever to be in good ho
pe to have ones better in time of prosperyte / For after gret^^ wer^^ comes
good p^^s / And after the rain comes the fair w^^r

The ix fable makes mencyon of the wulf and of the kydde

GOod Children ought to observe and keep ever the commandments of their good
parents and friends / whereof Esope recites to us such a fable / Of a goto
which had made her young kydde / and honger took her so that she would have
gone to the feldes for to ete some grass / Wherefore she said to her kyd / My
child / beware well / that if the wulf come hyder to ete the / that thou opene
not the door to him / And when the got was gone to the feldes / came the
wulf to the door / And faynynge the gotes voice said to the kydde / My child
opene to me the door / And then the kydde ansuerd to him / goo hens euylle
and falls best / For well I see the through that hole / but for to have me thou
faynest the wyce of my mother / And therefore I shall keep me well fro opening
of any door of this hows / And thus the good children ought ever to keep well /
and put in their heart and memory the doctrine and the techyng of their parents
/ For many one is undone and lost for fault of obedyence*

The tenthe fable is of the good man and of the serpente




sa^^en comynly that of the euylle of other / men ought not to lawhe ne scorn

comes a great noise and danger

The xiij fable is of the fox and of the storke
Thou ought not to do to other that which thou would not that men should
do to the / whereof Esope re herceth to us such a fable / Of a fox which
conveyed a storke to souper / And the fox put the mete upon a trauncher / the
which mete the storke might not ete / whereof she took and had great
displaysaunce / and went and departed out of the foxes hows al hongry and
went again to her lodgys / And by cause that the fox had thus begyled her /
she bythoughte in her self / how she might begyle the Fox / For as men say /
it is merit to begyle the begylers / wherefore the storke prayed the fox to
come and soupe with her / and put his mete within a glass / And when the fox
would have eten / he might not come there by / but only he lycked the glass /
because he cowde not reche to the mete with his mouth / And then he knew
well that he was deceived / And then the storke said to him / Take of such
goods as thou gave to me / And the pour fox right shameful departed fro
thens / And with the staf which he had made he was beat And therefore he that
begyleth other / is oftyme begyled him self /

the Mule / Ha a payllari Mule / why ghost thou not faster / I shall so egrely
pryke the / that I shall make the to go lyghtely / And the Mule answered to the
fly / god keep and preserve the moon for the wolves / For I have no great
dread ne fere of the / But I dread and doubt sore my master / which is upon
me / which constrayneth me to fulfylle his will / And more I ought to dread

recyteth such a fable / Of the ante or formyce and of the fly / which

the fly said to the formyce / Come hyder formyce / wylt thou compare thy self
to me that dwell in the kings places and palace / and ete and drink at their
table / And also I kiss both king and queen / and the most fair maidens /
And thou pour and myschaunt be thou art ever within the earth / And then
the formyce ansuerd to the fly / Now know I well thy vanyte and folly / For
thou auauntest the of that whereof thou sholdest disprayse the / For fro all
places where as thou ghost or flyest / thou art

the love of me / but only thou have done it for to fylle thy belly For if thou
had done it for the love of me / I should have pardonned to the / And by
cause that thou dydest not for to serve me / but for to let and ado^mage me /
For that the rattes might not ete / thou burest it awey / And so by cause /
that thou art wexed fat of mine own bread / thou must render and give to me
all the fatness / which thou have conquered and gotten here / For he that
robs shall be robbed / Iuxta il^^ / pillatores pillabuntur / For hit
suffyseth not to do well / but men must have good will and good entencion for
to do hit / For an alms that is done for vain glory / is not merited / but
dismeryted / wherefore I shall not pardonne the / but incontinent and without
taryenge thou shall deye / For by cause that thou have deseruyd no mercy / thou
shall now be put to death

The xx fable makes mention of the Ox / and of the frogge / which would have
compared her to him


THe pour ought not to compare him self to him which is rich and mighty / As
says this fable of a frogge / which was in a medowe / where she aspyed and

the ox / and by her great pride she began to swelle ageynste the ox / And
demanded of his chil dren if she was not as great as the ox and as mighty /
And their children ansuerd and said / nay mother / For to book and behold on the
ox / it seems of you to be nothing / And then the frogge began more to
swelle / And when the ox saw her pride / he thradde and thrested her with his
fo te / and brake her belly / Therefore hit is not good to the pour to compare
him self to the rich / wherefore men sayn comynly / Swelle not thy self / to
the end that thou breast not

outest to love and praise the fayttes or deeds which they have done in their
yongthe / Whereof Esope reherceth to us such a fable / Of a lord which had a
dog / the which dog had be in his yongthe of good kind / For ye wot well
/ that of kind the dogs chacen and hunten in their yongthe / and have great

old age / and that he might no more run / It happeth ones that he let escape

betest and set me a bak / have memory how in mine young age / I was strong
and lusty / And how I made great oultrages and effors / the which caused my
yongthe / And now when I am bycome old and feeble thou set naught of me /
This fable techeth that who so ever does any good in his yongthe / in his
auncyente and old age he shall not continue in the virtues which he posseded
in his young age

The viij fable is of the hares and of the frogs

MEn say comynly that after that the tym^^ goth / so must folk go / For if
thou make distinction of the time thou shall well accord the scryptures /
whereof Esope reherceth to us such a fable / And says thus / that he which
beholds the euylle of other / must have pacyence of the euylle that may come
upon him / For sometime as a hunter chaced through the feldes and woods / the

HE that ought not to be assewred that applyketh and sets him to do to
sum other any evil / whereof esope reherceth such a fable / Of a serpent /
which went and came in to the hows of a pour man / which serpent lived of

great fortune to this pour man and bycame much rich / But on a day this man
was angry ageynste the serpent / and took a great staf / and smote at him / and
gretely hurted him wherefore the serpente went out of his house And therein he
came never again / And within a little while after this / this man returned
and fell again in to great pouerte / And then he knew that by the fortune
of the Ser pent he was bycome rich / and repentyd him much of that (...)
smote the serpent / And then this pour man went and humbled him before the

that I have done to the And then said the serpente to the pour man / Sith
thou repentest the of thy mysdede / I pardonne and forgive it to the But as
long as I shall be on live / I shall remember me of thy malice / For as thou
hurtest me ones / thou may as well hurt me another time / For the wound: that
thou made to me / may not forgete the euylle which thou host done to me
wherefore he that was ones euylle / shall ever be presumed and holden for
euylle / And therefore men ought to presume over him / by whom they receive
some dommage and not have suspecte their good and true friends

The xj fable is of the heart / of the sheep and of the wulf
THe thing which is promised by force and for dread is not to be hold / whereof
esope reherceth such a fable of a heart which in the presence of a wulf

commanded to the sheep to pay hit / And when the day of payment was come /
the heart came and demanded of the sheep his corn And the sheep said to him /
the conenaunces and pactyons made by dread and force ought not to be holden /
For it was force to me being to fore the wulf to promytte and grant to give
to the that which thou never lenest to me / And therefore thou shall have right
naught of me / Wherefore sometime it is good to make promise of some thing for
to eschew gretter dommage or loss / For the things which are done by force
have none fydelyte

which found a deed man's head / the which he turned up so down with his foot
/ And said / Ha a how fair have thou be and playsaunt / And now thou have in
the neither wit / ne beauty / and yet thou art without wys and without any
thought / And therefore men ought not only to behold the beaulte and fayrenesse

The xv fable is of the Iaye and of the pecok

NOne ought to were and put on him the gown of other / whereof Esope

all his felawes / And when the pecoks knew that he was not of their kind /
they anon plucked of all his feathers / And smote and beat him by such manner
/ that no feathers abode upon him / And he fled away al naked and bare /

And then when his felawes saw him / they said to him / what gallaunt come
hither / where ben thy fair feathers / which thou had but late a gone /
Have thou no shame ne vergoyne to come in our company / And then all the
birds came upon him / and smote and let him / saying thus to him / if thou
had be content of thyn own vestymentes / thou had not come to this
vylony / There for hit appears that hit is not good to were another man's

ha^^ed chaced and put out / and lyuest in great danger / for as soon as the
winter shall come thou shall deye / And I shall abide on live alone within my
chamber or hole / where as I drink and ete at my playsyr / For the winter
shall not forgive to the thy mysdede / but he shall slay the / And thus he
that will mocque or dispreyse sum other / he ought first to look and behold
on him self well / For men sayn comynly / who that beholds in the glass / well
he sees him self / And who sees him self / well he knows him self / And who
that kno weth him self well / little he preyseth him self / And who that preyseth
him self little / he is full wise and sage

And then the ape which was set as a Judge / gaf such a sentence / And

thing / how be it / that thou denyest hit in Justice / But for as much that
pees may be bytwixe you both / ye shall part to gyder your good / to the end /
that none of you have no hole part / For he that is wont and acustomed to
rolbe and guawe / with great pain he may absteyne him self fro hit / For a

whereof the first makes mention / of the lion / and of the pastor or herdman
THe mighty and puyssaunt ought not to be slowfull of the benefetes done to
them by the lytyl and small And ought not also to forgete them / but that
they may be rewarded of them / And this fable approves esope and shows unto
us / of a lion which ran after a be / and as he ran / a thorn entered
in to his foot / which hurted and grieved him gretely / wherefore he might no
ferther goo / but as well as he cowde he came to a shepeherd which kept his
sheep and began to flatere with his taylle showing to him his foot / which
was sore hurted and wounded / The sheepherd was in great dread and casted
before the lion one of his sheep But the lion demanded no mete of him / For
more he desired to be medycyned and made hole of his foot / And af ter when
the sheepherd saw the wound / he with a nydle sub tylly drew out of his
foot the thorn / and had out of the wound all the roten flesh / and
enoynted hit with sweet oynements / And anon the lion was hole / And for to
have rend^^d graces and thankys to the sheepherd or pasto ur the lion kyssed
his hands / And after he returned ageyn in to the highest of the wood / And
within a little while after it happed that this lion was taken and conveyed to
the Cite of Rome and was put among the other beestes for to devour the
mysdoers / Now it befelle that the said shepeherd commysed a crymynous deed /
wherefore he was condemned to be devoured by these bestes / And right so as he
was cast among them the lion knew him / and began to behold on him / and
made to him chere* and lykked him with his tongue / And pre served and kept
him from all the other bestes / Then knew the sheepherd that it was the
lion which he maade hole / And that he would then have recompensed him of the
good which he had done to him / whereof all the Romans were all wonderly
abashed / And would know the cause of hit And the sheepherd said to them as
above is said / And when they knew the cause / they gaf leave to the
sheepherd / to goo home / and sent again the lion in to the forest / And
therefore this is notary and true that al manner of folk ought to render and
give thankynges grace and mercy to their good doers / For slowfulnes is a
sin / which is much displaysaunt to god /

The second fable is of the lion and of the horse

^^The one ought to eschew dyssymylyng / for none out to were on him the skyn
of the wulf / but that he will be like to him / For none out to feign him self
other than such as he is / As to ve reherceth this fable / Of a lion which
saw a horse / which ete grass in a medowe / And for to find sum subtylyte
and manner for to ete and devour him / approached to him / and said / god keep
the my brother / I am a leche / and with all a good phisycyen / And by cause that
I see that thou have a sore foot / I am come hither for to hele the of hit /
And the horse knew well all his evil thought And said to the lion / My brother I
thank the gretely / and thou art welcome to me / I pray the that thou wylt
make my foot hole / And then the lion said to the horse / late see thy foot
/ And as the lion looked on hit / the horse smote him on the forhede / In such
wise that he brake his head and fill out of hismynde / and the lion fell to
the ground / And so wonderly he was hurt / that almost he might not rise up
again / And then said the lion in him self / I am well worcester thy to have had
this / For he that sercheth euylle / evil comes to him / And by cause that I
dyssymyled and feigned my self to be a medicine / where as I should have showed my
s^^ a great enemy / I therefore have received good reward / And therefore every
body ought to show him self such as he is /

The third fable makes mention of the ass / of the horse / and of their fortune

HE that is well fortuned and happy / and is at vpperest of the whele of
fortune / may well fall down / And therefore none ought to disprayse the pour
/ but ought to think how the whele of fortune is much doubtuous as shows
this present fable / Of a fair horse which was well harnaysed and arrayed / and
his sadel and brydel garnysshed with gold / which horse met with an ass sore
laden in a narowe way / And by cause that the ass turned him not a bak
Incontinent the horse said to him / Ha a chorle have thou no shame ne vergoyne
/ that thou doste ne berest none worship ^^e reverence unto thy lord / who
holds now me / that with my foot I break not thyn head / by cause that thou
put test not thy self aside and out of my way / so that I might pass and goo
on my way / The pour ass ansuerd ne said to him never a word / and was sore
aferd that the horse should have be^^ him / wherefore he held his pees as wise and
sage / And the horse went his way / And within a little while after / it
^^felle / that fortune turned his whele up so down / For this ^^yre horse
^^ame old lene and seek / And when his maystre saw that his horse was thus
lene and seek and out of prosperyce / he comau^ded that he should be had in to
the town And that instead of his rich sadel men should put and set on his
luck a panyer for to bear dounge in to the feldes / Now it happed that the
ass which was in a medowe etyng grass perceived and saw the horse and well
knew hym' / whereof he was wonder abusshed / and merueylled much that he was
thus pour and so lene bycome / And the Ass went toward him and said / Ha a
felawe. where is now thy fair sadel / and thy rich brydel / garnysshed with
gold / how art thou now bycome so lene and such a payllard / what have
prouffyted to the thy fair and rich rayments / and what auaylled now to the
thy great fyerste and pride / and thy great presumpcion which ones thou
show to me / Think now / how thou art lene and vnthrysty / And how thou
and I ben now of one office / And the miserable and unhappy horse was abusshed /
And for shame looked dounward / and ansuerd never one word / for all his
felycite was then turned in to aduersyte / And therefore they that been in
felycite / ought not to dysprayse them / which ben in aduersyte / For many
one I knew rich and mighty / which are now pour /

The iiij fable makes mencyon of the beestes and of the birds

NOne may do no good to two bordes at ones / which ben contrary one to that
other / as says to us this fable that the beestes made great werre against the
birds / and fought every day to gyder / And the back feryng the wulues And
that the beestes should vaynquysshe and overcome the birds / would have hold
with the beestes / and be against the birds / And when the bataylle was
ordained on both sides / the egle began to enter in to the battle of the
beestes by such a strength / that with the help of the other birds he gat
the feld / and vaynquysshed / and overcame the bestes / wherefore the bestes
maade pees with the birds / and were all of one acord and of one will / And
for the treason that the ^^acke had made / she was condemned to never see the
day / And never flee / but only by night / And also she was despoylled of all
her feathers / And therefore he that will serve two lords co^ trary one to
other may not be good ne true / And they which relynquen and leave their own
lords for to serve another stranger / which is enemy to their lord / ben well
worthy to be punysshed / For as the Euangely says / None may serve both god
and the devil

The v fable is of the nyghtyngale and of the sperehawke /

HE that oppresses the Innocents shall have an evil end / whereof Esope
reherceth to us such a fable / Of a sperehawk / which did put him within the
nest of a nyghtyngale / where he fond the lytyl and young birds / the
nyghtyngale came and perceived him / wherefore she praid the sperehawke / saying
/ I require and pray the as much as I may / that thou have pity on my small
birds / And the sperehawke ansuerd and said / if thou wylt that I grant the
thy request / thou must sing swetely after my will and gree And then the
nyghtyngale began to sing swetely / not with the heart / but with the threte
only / For he was so filled of sorrow that otherwise he might not do / The
sperehawk said then to the nyghtyngale / This song playseth me not / And
took one of the young birds and devoured hit / And as the said sperehawke would
have devoured and eten the other came there a hunter which did cast a great
net upon the sperehawke / And when she would have fleen awey / he might not
/ for he was taken / And therefore he that does harm and lets the Innocents
/ is worthy to deye of euylle death / As Caym did which slew his brother Abel

The seventh fable is of the fox and of the wulf

FOrtune helps both the good and euylle folk / and to all them / which
she helps not she sends euylle to them / And they that setten all their
malice ageynste fortune ben subuertysed and ouerthrawon by her / whereof Esope
reherceth such a fable / Of a wulf which had assembled to gyter a great proye
/ or much mete for to have lived more delyaously / whereof the fox had great
envy / and for to have robbed sum of this good / he came unto the cauerne or
hole where as this proye or mete was in / and said to the wulf / My godsep the
wulf / by cause hit is long sith I saw the / I am in great heaviness and
sorrow / and also by cause we have not ben in long time gone chaced and gone to
gyder / And when the wulf knew the malice of the fox / he said to him thou
art not come hyder for to see me / ne how I fare / but thou art come for to
rob and rauysshe my good / For the which words the fox was much angry /
and went toward a sheepherd / to whom he said / if thou wylt be avenged of
the wulf which is enemy of thy heerd or park / on this day I shall put him
under thy hands / And the sheepherd ansuerde to the fox in this manner / if
thou do as thou say / I shall pay the well / And then the fox showed to
him the hool / wherein the wulf was / And the sheepherd Incontinent went toward
the hole / and with a spear he kyld the wulf / And by this manner the fox was
well filled and refresshyd of the good of other / but as he returned homeward /
he was taken and devoured by sum dogs / wherefore he said to him self / by
cause that right euylle I have done / euylle comes now to me / For sin
retorneth ever upon his master / And he that lives but of rauyn and robberye
shall at the last be known and robbed /

The seventh fable is of the heart and of the hunter
MEn preysen sometime that that should be blamed and vitu pered / And often men
blamen and vytuperen that / that should be preysyd / as recites to us this
fable of a her te / To whom it happyd on a time that he drank in a fontayn or
well as he drank / he saw in the water his head which was horned / wherefore
he preysed much his horns / And as he looked on his legs / which were lene
and small / he dispreysed and vytupered them / And as he was drinking in the
fontayne he herd the voys and barkynge of dogs / wherefore he would have fled
awey in to the forest for to save him self / but as he saw the dogs so nyghe
him he would have entrid within a busshe / but he might not / for his horns
kept him without / And then seeing that he might not escape began to say
within him self / I have blamed and vytupered my legs / which have been to me
vtyle and profitable / and have preysed my horns / which ben now cause of
my death / And therefore men ought to disprayse that thing / which is
vnprouffitable / and preyse that which is vtyle and profitable / And they
ought to preyse and love the church and the commandments of the same / the
which ben much vtyle and prouf fytable / And dispreyse and flee al sin and
vice / Which ben inutyle harmeful and dommageable

The viij fable makes mention of Juno / of Menus / and of the other wymmen

BEfore the gods and the goddesses men must ever preyse chastyte / for it is
a worshipful and an honest thing to a woman to hold her content with a man
alone / but Menus for her disporte and for to drive aweye the time / would
Interpret the saying of the hens / wherefore she demanded a hen which
was in her hows / but at this time I shall keep my tongue / and no ferther I
shall speak thereof / For many wise men which have seen and read all this
book under standen well all the nature of hit / And by cause it is lycyte and
honest / And that we all ben bounden to keep the ladies in their worship and
honor / also that in every place where hit shall be possible to us. we ought
to preyse them / We shall now cesse to enquere ferther of this matere / and
Historye / which we shall leave iij latin for the great clerks / and in
especial for them that will occupye their time to study and read the gloss of
the said Esope

The nynthe fable is of the knight and of the wydowe

THe woman which lives in this world without reproach or blame is worthily to
be gretely preysed / whereof Esope reherceth such a fable of a man and of a
woman / which loved much each other / It happed then by the effors of
Atropos or death / the which we al must suffer / that the said man deyde / And
as men would have borne him in to his grave / which was without the town
there to be bu ryed / his wife made great sorrow and wept pyteously / And
when he was buried / she would abide stylle upon the grave / and let do make
a little lodge or hows thereupon / and out of this lodge she would never depart
for no prayer ne fair word / neither for any yeftes ne for menaces of her
parents Now it befell in the town that a mysdoer was condampned to be hanged /
And to the end that he should not be taken fro the galhows / hit was then
commanded that a knight should keep him / And as the knight kept him / great
thirst took him / And as he perceived the lodge of the said woman he went to
her / and prayed her to give him sum drink / And she with good heart gaf him
to drink / And the knight drank with great appetyte / as he that had great
thirst / and when he had drunk / he turned again to the galhows ward / This
knight came another time to the woman for to comfort her / And three times he
did so / And as he was thus going and coming / doubting him of no body / his
hanged man was taken and had fro the galhows / And when ne the knight was come
again to the galhows and saw that he had lost his deed man / he was gretely
abashed and not without cause For hit was charged to him upon pain to be
hanged / if he were take awey / This knight then seeing his Judgment /
turned and went again to the said woman / and cast him at her feet / and
lay before her as he had be deed / And she demau^ ded of him / My friend / what
wylt thou that I do for the / Allas said he / I pray the that thou socoure
and counceylle (...) now at my great need / For by cause I have not kept well my
thief / which men have rauysshed fro me / the king shall make me to be put
to death / And the woman said / Have no dread my friend / For well I shall
find the manner whereby thou shall be delyuerd / For we shall take my husbond /
and shall hang him instead of thy thief / Then began she to delue / and
took out of the earth her husbond / and at nyt she hanged him at the galhows
instead of the other / and said to the knight / My right dear friend I pray the
that this be kept well secret / For we do hit theefly / And thus the deed men
have sum / which make sorrow for them / but that sorrow is sone gone and
passyd / And they which ben on live have some which dread them / but their
dread wantith and faylleth when they ben deed

The tenthe fable makes mencyon of the young man / and of the common woman

OF the common and folysshe wymmen Esope reherceth to us such a fable / Of a
woman which had to name Tahys / the which was cause by her feyned love of the
death and loss of many young men / to one of the which she had be beat often
before that time / she said to him in this wy se / My right dear love and good
friend / I suppose that of ma ny one I am well byloued and desired / Nevertheless
I shall set my love on thy self alone / wherefore I pray the that thou may
be mine / and I shall be thyn / for all thy goods I retche not / but only I
desire thy sweet body / And he that knew the feyntyse and falsheed of the
woman / ansuerd to her / right benyngly and swetely / thy will and the mine ben
both but one alone / For thou art she which I most desire / and the which I
shall love all the term of my life / if thou deceive me no more / For by cause
that thou have received me in time passed / I am ever aferd of the / but
notwithstondynge this / thou art now much playsaunt and fair to the syghte of
me / And thus the one begyled that other / For the love of a common woman is not
to be trusted / For thou ought to know and thynk within thy self / that the
common and folyssh woman love the not / but she loves thy silver

The xj fable is of the fader and of the euylle sone /

THe good and wise fader ought to chastyse his children in their young age / and
not in their old age / For then hit is much dyffycyle to make them bow As
to us r^^ateth this fable / Of a fader of famylle / which had a sone the
which did no thing that he ought to have done but ever was going and
playeng in the town / And the fa^^r for the crime and mys^^wle of his sone
brawled ever and beat his meyny / And said to them such a fable / Of a plough
man or labourer / which bond a bole by the horns to an ox The booll would not
be bound / and smo^^ strongly with his feet after the man / and launched his
horns at him / And at the last when he was bound / the labourer said to them /
I have joined and bound you both to gyder / to the end that ye too sum labor
/ But I will that the lest of you two / that is to wete the boole / be learned
and corryged of the most / whi che is the ox / For I must said the labourer
to him self bind them thus to gyder / to the end that the bole / which is young
fyers and malyaous and strong / smite ne hurt no body / whereof great dommage
might come to me / But by cause that I wot well / that the ox shall teache
and corryge him well / I have put and bound them both to gyder / Thus this
fable shows to us / that the fader ought to teache and give good ensample to
his children and chastyse them when they be young For he that well loves / well
he chastyseth

The xij fable is of the serpent

THe Auctor that is to wete Esope reherceth to us such a fable of two euyls /
saying that a serpent entryd some time within the forge of a smythe / for to
search sum mete for her dinner / It happed / that she fond a fyle which she
began to gnawe with her trethe / Then said the fyle to her / if thou byte
and gnawe me / yet shall thou do to me no hurt / but bytynge and gnawyng on
me / thou shall hurt thyn own self / For by my strength all the iron is
planed by me / And therefore thou art a fool to gnawe me / For I tell the /
that none evil may hurt ne adommage another as euylle as he / Ne none wicked
may hurt another wicked / ne also the hard against the hard shall not break
each other / ne two enuyous men shall not both ride upon an ass / wherefore the
mighty and strong must love him which is as mighty and as strong as him self
is

The xiij fable is of the wulues and of the sheep

When men have a good head / and a good defe^^sour / or a good Captain /
men ought not to leave him / for he that leueth him repents him afterward of
hit / as to ve reherceth this fable / Of the sheep which had werre and
discencion with the wolves / And by cause that the wulues made to strong werre
against the sheep / the sheep then took for their help the dogs / and the
whethers also / And then was the bataylle of the sheep so great and so
strong / and fought so vygorously against the wolves. that they put them to
flyt And when the wolves saw the strength of their aduersarye^^ / they sent
an ambassade toward the sheep for to trete the pees with them / the which
Ambassade said to the sheep in this manner / if ye will give us the dogs / we
shall swear unto you our feythe / that we shall never keep ne hold werre
against you / And the sheep ansuerd / if ye will give us your faith / we
shall be content / And thus they made pees to gyder / but the wulues kyld the
dogs / which were capytayns and protectours of the sheep / And the dogs
did but little hurt to the wulues / wherefore when the lytyl and young wulues
were grown in their age / they came of each part and country / and assembled
them to gyder / and all of one accord and will said to their Auncestres and
faders / we must ete up all the sheep / And their faders ansuerd thus to them
/ we have maade pees with them / Nevertheless the young wolves brake the pees
and ran fyersly upon the sheep / and their faders went after them / And thus
by cause that the sheep had delyuerd the dogs to the wolves / the which were
their capitayns / and that they had none that kept them / they were all eten
and devoured of the wulues / Therefore hit is good to keep well his capytayne /
which may at a need g^^ue socour and help / For a true friend is oftyme
better at a need than a Royalme / For if the sheep had kept the love of the
dogs / the wolves had never devoured them / wherefore it is a sure thing to
keep well the love of his protector and good friend /

The xiiij fable is of the man and of the wood
HE that gives aid and help to his enemy is cause of his death / as recyteth
this fable of a man which made an axe / And after that he had made his axe /
he asked of the trees / and said / ye trees give you to me a handle / And the
trees were content / And when he had maade fast his handle to the axe / he
began to cut and throw down to the ground all the trees / wherefore the oak
and the Asshe sa yd / if we be cut / hit is well right and reason / For of
our own self we ben cut and thrawen down / And thus hit is not good to put
him self in to the danger and subjection of his enemy / ne to help him for
to be ado^maged / as thou may see by this present fable / For men ought not
to give the staf / by which they may he beten with

The xv fable is of the wulf and of the dog /

LYberte or fredome is a much sivete thing / as Esope reherceth by this fable
/ of a wulf and of a dog whi che by adventure met to gyder / wherefore the
wulf demanded of the dog / whereof art thou so fat and so play saunt / And
the dog ansuerd to him / I have well kept my lords hows / and have barked
after the thieves which came in the hows of my master / wherefore he and his
meyny give to me plente of good mete / whereof I am fat and playsaunt / and
the wulf said then to him / It is well said my brother / Cer taynly sith thou
art so well at thyn ease and farest so well I have great desire to dwell with
the / to the end that thou and I make but one dinner / well said the dog / come
on with me if thou wylt be as well at thyn ease as I am / and have thou no
doubt of no thing / The wulf went with the dog / and as they went by the
way / the wulf beheld the dogs neck / which was al bare of here / and
demanded of the dog / My brother why is thy neck so shaven / And the dog
ansuerd / it is by cause of my great coler of iron / to the which daily I am
fasted / And at night I am unbound for to keep the hows the better / Then
said the wulf to the dog / This I myster ne need not / For I that am in
lyberte / will not be put in no subjection / And the^^for for to fylle my belly
/ I will not be subget / if thou be acustommed for to be bound / continue thou
in hit / and I shall live as I am wont and acustomed / therefore there is no
richesse gretter / than lybete / For lyberte is better than all the gold of
the world /

The xvj fable makes mention of the hands / of the feet / and of the man's belly
HOw shall one do any good to another / the which can do no good to his own
self / As thou may see by this fable / Of the feet and of the hands /
wh^^che sometime had grede stryf with the belly / saying / All that we can or may
win with great labor thou etest it all / and yet th^^u do no good /
wherefore thou shall no more have nothing of us / and we shall let the deye
for honger / And then when the belly was empty and sore hongry / she began
to cry (...) said Allas I deye for hongre / give me somewhat to ete / And the
feet and hands said / thou getest no thing of us / And by cause that the belly
might have no mete / the conduyts thorugh the which the metes passes b^^me
small and narowe / And within few days after the feet and hands for the
feebleness which they felt would then have given mete to the belly / but it was
to late / for the conduits were joined to gyder And therefore the lymmes might
do no good to other / that is to wete the belly / And he that governs not well
his belly with great pain he may hold the other lymmes in their strength and
virtue / wherefore a servant ought to serve well his master / to the end that
his master hold and keep him honestly / and to receive and have good reward of
him / when his master shall see his feythfulnesse

The xvij fable is of the Ape and of the fox

OF the pour and of the Rich Esope reherceth such a fable / Of an ape /
which prayed the fox to give him sum of his great taylle for to couere his
buttoks therewith / saying thus to him / what auaylleth to the so long a
taylle / hit does but wagge / And that which lets the / shall be
profitable and good for me / The fox said to him I would that hit were yet
longer / For rather I would see hit al to fowled and dagged / than hit should
bear to you such ho nour / as to couere thy foul buttoks therewith / And
therefore give thou not that thing of which thou have need of / to the end
that afterward thou myster not of hit

The xviij fable si of the Merchant and of the ass
MAny one ben trauaylled after their death / wherefore men ought not to desire
the death / As reherceth Esope by this fable / Of a merchant which ladde an
Ass laden unto the market / And for to be the sooner at the market / he beat
his ass / and sore prycked him / wherefore the pour ass wysshed and desired
hisowne death / wenyng to him that after his death he should be in rest / And
after that he had be well beat and chaced he deyde / And his master made him to
be flayne / and of his skin he did do make tambours which ben ^^uer beat /
And thus for what pain that men may have during his life / he ought not to
desire and wysshe his ^^the / For many one ben / which have great pain in
this world-that shall have a great ter in the other world / For the man has no
rest for the death but for his merytes

The xix fable is of the heart and of the ox
Only for to flee none is assured to escape the danger wh^^rfore he flees /
As thou shall mow see by this fable / Of a heart which ran before the
dogs / and to the end that he should not be take / he fled in to the first
town that he found / and entryd in to a stable where as many oxen we re / to
whom he said the cause why he was come there / prayeng them swetely that they
would save him / And the oxen said thus to him / Allas pour heart thou art
among us euylle adressyd / thou sholdest be more surely in the feldes. For if
thou be perceived or seen of the oxeherd or else of the master / Certainly thou
art but deed / Helas for god and for pity I pray you that ye will hyde me
within your rack / and that ye deceive me not / and at night next coming / I
shall goo hens / and shall put my self in to a sure place / And when the
servant came for to give heye to the oxen / they did cast heye before the
oxen / and went again their way and saw not the heart / whereof the heart
was gretely reioysshed wenynge to have escaped the peril of death / He then
rendered thank and graces to the oxen / and one of the oxen said to him / It is
facyle to escape out of the hands of the blyn^^ but hit is not facyle to escape
fro the hands of him that sees well / For if our master come hither which
has more than an honderd eyes / Certainly thou art deed if he perceive the
And if he see the not / certainly thou art saved / and shall goo forth on thy
way surely / The mayst^^r withyn a short while after entryd in to the seab^^
And after he commanded to vysyte and see the hey / which was before his oxen
/ And him self went and tasted / if they had enough of hit / And as he tasted
thus the heye / he felt the horns of the heart with his hand / and to him self
he said / what is that that I feel here / and being dredeful called all his
servants / and demanded of the manner how the heart was come thither / And
they said to him / My lord I know nothing thereof / And the lord was full
glad and made the heart to be taken and slain / and maade a great feast for
to ha ue ete him / Therefore it happeth oftyme / that he which supposes to
flee is taken and hold within the lace or net / For he that flees awey is in
great peril / wherefore men ought well to ke pe them self to do such deed /
that they must needs flee therefore

The xx fable makes mention of the fallace of the lion / And of his
conversation

TO converse with folk of euylle life is a thing much peryllous / And only to
speak with them lets much other / As this fable reherceth of a lion right
strong and right mighty / the which made him self king for to ha ue great
renommee and glory / And fro then forthon he began to change his
condycions and customme showing him self curtois / and swore that he should
hurt no bestes / but should keep them against every one / And of this promise
he repented him by cause hit is much dyffycyle and hard to change his own
kind / And therefore when he was angry / he lad with him sum small beestes
in to a secret place for to ete and deceive them / And demanded of them / if
his mouth stanke or not / And they that said that it stanke or not were al
saved / And all they the which ansuerd not he killed / and devoured them al /
It happed that he demanded of the Ape / if his mouth stanke or not / And
thape said no but that hit smells like baine / And then the lion had shame
to slay the ape / but he fond a great falsheed for to put him to death / He
feigned to be seek and commanded that al his leches and Cyrurgyens should anon
come unto him / when they were come / he commanded them to book his vryne /
And when they had seen hit^^ / they said to him / Sire ye shall soon be hole
/ but ye must ete light metes / And by cause that ye be king / all is at your
commandment / And the lion ansuerd Allas Right feign I would ete of an Ape /
Certainly said the me decyn that same is good mete / Then was the Ape sen^^e
for And not withstondyng that he worshipfully spak and ansuerd to the king /
the king made him to deye / and devoured him Therefore hit is peryllous and
harmeful to be in the felauship of a Tyrant / For be hit euylle or good he
will ete and devour every thing / And well happy is he / that may ecape fro
his blody hands / And that may eschew and flee the felauship of the evil
tyraunts

The first fable makes mencyon of the fox and of the raysyns

HE is not wise / that desires to have a thing which he may not have / As
recites this fable Of a fox / which looked and beheld the raysyns that grew
upon an high vine / the which raysyns he much desired for to ete them And
when be saw that none he might get / he turned his sorrow in to Joy / and
said these raysyns ben sour / and if I had some I would not ete them / And
therefore this fable shows that he is wise / which fayneth not to desire that
thing the which he may not have /

The second fable is of the ancient wesel and of the rat /
Wit is better than force or strength / As reherceth to us this fable of an
old wesel / the which might no more take no rats / wherefore she was often sore
hongry and bethought her that she should hyde her self withynne th^^ f^^ure for
to take the rats which came there for to ete hit. And as the rats came to the
flower / she took and ete them each o^^e after other / And as the oldest rat of
all perceyned and knew^^ h^^r malice / he said thus in him self / Certainly I
shall k^^pe me well fro the / For I know all thy malice and falshede And
therefore he is wise that scapeth the wit and malice of euylle folk / by
wit and not by for^^

The thirdde fable is of the wulf and of the sheepherd and of the hunter
MAny folk show them self good by their words whi che are full of great
fantasyes / As reherceth to us this fable of a wulf which fled before the
hunter / And as he fled he met with a sheepherd / to whom he sai^^ My
friend I pray the that thou t^^lle not to him that follows me which wey I am
gone / and the sh^^epherd said to him have no dread ne fere no thing / For I
shall not accuse the / For I shall show to him another way / And as the
hunter came / he demanded of the sheepherd if he had seen the wulf pass / And
the sheepherd both with the heed and of the eyes showed to the hunter the place
where the wulf was / and with the hand and the tongue showed all the contrary
/ And incontinent the hunter understood him well / But the wulf which perceived
well all the feigned manners of the sheepherd fled awey / And within a little
while after the sheepherd encountered and met with the wulf / to whom he said
/ pay me of that I have kept the secret / And then the wulf ansuerd to him
in this manner / I thank thyn hands and thy tongue / and not thyn head ne
thyn eyes / For by them I should have been bytrayd / if I had not fled aweye /
And therefore men must not trust in him that has two faces and two tongues /
for such folk is like and semblable to the scor pion / the which enoynteth
with his tongue / and prycketh sore with his taylle

The fourth fable is of Juno the goddess and of the pecok and of the
nyghtyngale

^^ery one ought to be content of kind / and of such good as god has sent
unto him / whereof he must use Iusely / As wherceth this fable of a pecok which
(...) me to Juno the goddess / and said to her I am heavy and so rowful / by
cause I can not sing as well as the nyghtyngale For every one mocketh and
scorneth me / by cause I can not sing / And Juno would comfort him and said /
thy fair form and beau^^ is fayrer and more worthy and of gretter preysynge
than the song of the nyghtyngale / For thy feathers and thy color ben
resplendysshyng as the precious (...) And there is no bird like to thy feathers
ne to thy beaulte / And the pecok said then to Juno / All this is naught /
sith I can not sing / And then Juno said again thus to the pecok for to
content him / This is in the disposycion of the gods / which have given to
either of you one propyrte / and one virtue / such as it pleasyd them / As to
the they have given fair figure / to the egle have they given strength / and
to the nyghtyngale fair and playsau^t song / And so to all other birds /
wherefore every one must be content of that that he has For the miserable
auarycious / the more goods that they have the more they desire to have

The v fable makes mention of the panthere and of the vylayns

^^ery one ought to do well to the stranger and for: give to the miserable / As
reher^^th this fable of a pan there which fylle in to a pytte / And when the
vylayns or chorles of the country saw her / sum of them began to smite on
her / and the other said pardonne and forgive her / for she has hurted no body
/ and other were that gaf to her breed / And another said to the vylayns /
beware ye well that ye slay her not / And by cause that they were al of diverse
will / euerychone of them went and returned home a geyne wenynge that she
should deye within the said pytte / but lytyl and lytyl she clymmed up / and
went to her how^^ again / and made her to be well medecyned / in so much /
that soon she was al hole / And within a while after she has uynge in her
memory the great Iniurye that had be done to her came again to the place
where she had be hurt and sore beat / and began to kylle and slay all the
bestes which were there about and put all the sheepherds and swyneherds and
other which kept beestes all to flight / she burnt the Corn / and many
other evil and great harm she did there about / And when the folk of the
country saw the great dommage that she did to them / they came toward her /
prayenge that she would have pity on them / And to them she ansuerd in this
manner / I am not come hither to take vengeance on them which have had pity
and myserycorde of me / but only on them that would have slain me / And for the
wicked and euylle folk I recyte this fable / to the end that they hurt no body
/ For if all the vylaynes had had pity / the one as the other of the pour
panthere or ser^^ent which was stranger and miserable / as much as sh^^ was
fallen in to the pytte / the foresaid euylle and dommage had not come to them


The vj fable is of the bochers and of the whethers
When a lygnage or kynred is indyfferent or indyuysyon / not lightly they
shall do any thing to their salute / as reherceth to us this fable / Of a
bocher which entryd within a stable full of whethers / And after as the
whethers saw him / none of them said one word / And the bocher took the first
that he fond / Then the whethers spoke al to gyder and said / let him do
what he will / And thus the bocher took hem all one after another sauf one
only / And as he would have taken the last / the pour w^^ether said to him /
Justly I am worthy to be take / by ca^^ se I have not helped my felawes / For
he that will not help ne comfort other / ought not to demand or ask help
ne com forte / For virtue which is united is better than virtue separate

The seventh fable is of the fawkoner and of the birds

THe wise ought ever to keep and observe the good cost ceyll / And in no wise
they ought not to do the contra rye / As reherceth to us this fable / Of the
birds whi che were Ioyeful and glad / as the prymtemps came / by cause that
their nestes were then al couerd with leaves / And Incontinent they beheld and
saw a fawkoner which dressyd and leyd his laces and nets for to take them /
And then they said al to gyder / yonder man has pity of us / For when he
beholds us he wepeth / And then the pertryche / which had experymented and
assayed all the ^^ytes of the said Fawkoner / said to them / keep you all well
fro that said man and flee high in to the air / For he seeks nothing / but
the manner for to take you / For if he took you / he shall ete and devour you
/ or to the markette he shall bear you for to be sold / And they that byleuyd
his cou^ ceylle were saved / And they that byleuyd it not were taken and lost /
And therefore they which believe good counceylle are delyuerd out of their
peryls / And they which believe it not ben ever in great danger


IN time passyd men preysyd more the folk full of lesynges and falshede than
the man full of truth / the which thing regneth gretely unto this day / As
we may see* by this present fable / Of the man of truth and of the man liar /
which went both to gyder thorugh the coun trey / And so long they went to
gyder by their Iourneyes / that they came in to the pronynce of the apes / And
the king of thapes made them both to be taken and brought before him And he
being in his Royal mageste / where as he satte like an Emperor / and all his
Apes about him / as the subgets ben about their lord / would have demanded /
and in deed he demanded to the liar / who am I / And the lesynge maker and
flaterer said to him / thou art emperor and king / the fay rest creature
that is in earth / And after the king demanded of him again / who ben these
which ben al about me / And the liar ansuerd / Sire they ben your knights
and your subgettes for to keep your person / and your Royalme / And then the
king said thou art a good man / I will that thou be my great styward of my
household / and that every one bear to the honor and reverence / And when the
man of truth herd all this he said in him self / if this man for to have
made lesynges is so gretely enhaunced / then by gretter vayson / I shall be
more worshipped and enhaunced / if I say truth / And after the king would
ask the true man / and demanded of him / who am I / and all that been about
me / And then the man of truth ansuerd thus to him / thou art an ape and a
best right abhomynable / And all they which ben about the are like and
semblable to the / The king then commanded that he should be broken and
^^oren with teeth and claws and put all in to pyeces / And therefore it
happeth often that the liars and flaterers ben enhau^ ced / and the men of
truth ben set allow and put a back / For oftyme for to say truth men lose
their lives / the which thing is against Justice and equity

The ix fable is of the horse / of the hunter and of the heart /


NOne ought to put him self in subjection for to avenge him on other / For
better is not to submytte him self / than after to be submytted / as reherced
to us this fable / Of an horse which had envy over an heart / by cause the
heart was fayrer than he / and the horse by envy went unto an hunter / to whom
he said in this manner / if thou wylt believe me / we shall this day take a
good proye / ^^epe upon my ^^k / and take thy swerd / and we shall chase the
heart / and thou shall hytte him with thy swerd / and kylle him / and shall
take him / and then his flesh thou may ^^e / and his skin thou may
selle /

And then the hunter moved by auaryce / demanded of the horse / thynkest thou
by thy feythe that we may take the heart / of whom thou spekest to me of /
And the horse answered thus / Suffyse the / For there to I shall put al my
dylygence and all my strength / lepe upon me / and do after my counceylle /
And then the Hunter ^^epte forthwith upon the horse back / And the horse
began to run after the heart / And when the heart saw / him come he fled
/ And by cause that the heart ran faster / than the horse did / he soaped fro
them / and saved him / And then when the horse saw and felt him much weary /
and that he might no more run / he said to the hunter in this manner / alyght
fro my back / For I may bear the no more and have mist of my proye / Then
said the hunter to the horse Sith thou art entryd in to my hands / yet shall
not thou escape thus fro me / thou have the brydel in thy mouth whereby thou
may be kept stylle and arrested / And thou wylt lepe / the sadell shall
save me / And if thou wylt cast thy feet fro the / I have good spores for to
constrayne and make the goo whether thou wylt or not where as I will have the
/ and And therefore keep the well / that thou show not thy self rebelle unto
me / Therefore it is not good to put and submytte him self under the hand of
other wenynge thereby to be auen ged of him / ageynste whom men have envy /
For who submytteth him self under the might of other / he byndeth him self to
him


The tenthe fable is of the ass and of the lion
THe great callers by their high and loud cry suppo sen to make folk aferd /
as recyteth this fable / Of an ass which sometime met with a lion / to the
which the ass said / let us clymme upon the montayne / and I shall show to
the / how the beestes ben aferd of me / and the lion began to smyle / and he
ansuerd to the ass / Goo we my brother / And when they were upon the top of the
hylle / the ass byganne to cry / And the fox and hares began to flee / And
when thasse saw them flee said to the lion / See thou not how these
beestes dreden and doubten me / and the lion said / I had been also ferdfull of
thy voys / if I had not known be ^^ly that thou art but an ass / And
therefore men need not doubt ne dread him that auaunceth him self for to do
that that he can not do / For god keep the moon fro the wulues / Ne also men
need not doubt a fool for his menaces / ne for his high cry

The xj fable is of the hawke and of other birds /

THe ypocrytes maken to god a berd of straw / As recyteth to us this fable /
Of a hawke / which sometime feigned / that he would have celebred and holden a na
tall or a great feste / the which fest should be celebred within a Temple / And
to this feste and solempnyte he Inuyted and somoned all the small birds / to
the which they came / And Incontinent as they were all come in to the temple /
the (...) shette the gate and put them all to death / one after an other / And
therefore this fable shows to us / how we must keep our self fro all them / /
which under fair semynge have a falls heart / and that been ypocytes and
deceptours of god and of the world /

The xij fable is of the fox / and of the lion

Fair doctrine takes he in him self / that chastyseth him by the peril of
other / As to us reherceth this present fable / Of a lion which sometime
faygned him self seek / And when the beestes knew that the lion was seek /
they would goo all to vysyte and see him as their king / And Incontinent as
the beestes entryd in to his hows for ^^o see and comfort him / he devoured
and ete them / And when the foxes were come to the yate for to have vy sy^^d
the lion / they knew well the fallace and falshede of the lion and salewed him
at the enter of the yate / And en^^ not within / And when the lion saw that
they would not enter in to his hows / he demanded of them / why they would (...)
(...) within / And one of the foxes said to him / we kno (...) (...) (...) thy
trac^^s / that all the beestes which have entryd (...) (...) ^^ws came not
out again / And also if we entryd (...) (...) ^^ore should we come ageyne^^
And therefore he is (...) (...) that takes ^^ample by the dommage of other /
(...) (...) (...) enter in to the hows of a great lord / it is well facyle (...)
for to come out of hit again it is much dyffycyle /


The xiij fable is of the ass / and of the wulf
^^O none euylle man feythe ne truth ought never to be adiousted / As men may
well see by this Fable / Of a wulf which vysyted an ass which was well seek
the which wulf began to feel and taste him / and demanded of him / My
brother and my friend where about is thy sore / And the ass said to him / there
as thou tastest / And then the wulf faynyng to vysyte him / began to byte
and smite him / And therefore men must not trust fla terers / For one thing
they say / and done another

The xiiij fable is of the hedgehogge and of three lytyl kydddes

IT behooves not to the young and lytyl of age to mock ne scorn their older /
As this fable says / of three little hedgehogges / which mocked a great
hedgehogge / which fled before a wulf / And when he perceived the scornyng of
them / he said to them / Ha a pour fools and wood ye wot not wherefore I fle
/ For if ye wist and knew well thynconuenyent and paryll / ye should not much
of hit / And therefore when men seen that the great and mighty ben ferdful and
doubtous / the less or little oughen not to be assured / For when the town is
taken and gotten by fortune of war the Country about is not therefore more
acertayned / but ou^^ to tremble and shake

The xv fable is of the man and of the lion /

MEn ought not to believe the paynture / but the truth and the deed / as men
may see by this present Fall / Of a man and of a lion which had stryf to gyder
and were in great discencion for to were and know / which of them both was
more stronger / The man said / that he was stronger than the loyn / And for to
have his saying veryfyed / he showed to the lion a pyctour / where as a man
had vyctory over a lion / As the pyctour of Sampson the strong / Then said
the lion to the man / if the lion could make pyctour good and true / hit had
be herin painted / how the lion had had vyctorye of the man / but now I shall
show to the very and true witness thereof / The lion then led the man to
a great pytte / And there they fought to gyder / But the lion cast the man in
to the pytte / and submytted him in to his sub iection and said / Thou man /
now know thou all the truth / which of us both is stronger / And
therefore at the work is known the best and most subtyle werker /

The xvj fable is of the camel / and of the flee

HE that has no might ought not to gloryfye ne preyse him self of no thing /
As reherceth to us this present fable of a camele / which bare a great charge
or burden It happed that a flee by cause of the camels here lepte to the back
of the camel / and made her to be borne of him all the day And when they had
made a great way / And that the camel came at even to the lodgys / and was put
in the stable / the flee lepte fro him to the ground beside the foot of the
camel / And after she said to the camel / I have pity of the / and am comen
down fro thy back by cause that I will no more grieve ne trauaylle the by the
berynge of me / And the camel said to the flee / I thank the / how be it that
I am not sore laden of the / And therefore of him which may neither help ne
let men need not make great estymacion of

The xvij fable is of the Ant and of the sygale

IT is good to purueye him self in the, somer season of such things / whereof
he shall myster and have need in winter season / As thou may see by this
present fable / Of the sygalle / which in the winter time went and demanded
of the ant sum of her Corn for to ete / And then the Ant said to the
sygall / what have thou done all the somer last passed / And the sygalle ansuerd
/ I have song / And after said the ante to her / Of my corn shall not thou
none have / And if thou have song all the somer / dau^se now in winter / And
therefore there is one time for to do some labor and werk / And one time for
to have rest / For he that werketh not ne does no good / shall have often at his
teeth great cold and lack at his need /

The xviij fable is of the pilgrim and of the swerd /

AN euylle man may be cause of the perdycion or loss of mauy folk / As
regercetg to us this present Fable / Of a pilgrim / which fond in his way a
swerd And he asked of the swerd / what is he that has lost the / And the swerd
answered to the pilgrim / A man alone has lost me / but many one I have lost /
And therefore an evil man may well be lost / but er he be lost he may well let
many one / For by cause of an euylle man may come in a Country many euyls

The xix fable is of the sheeep and of the Crow

MEn ought not to iniurye n^^ disprayse the pour Innocents ne the simple
folk. As reherceth this fable / Of a Crow / which set her self upon the

/ thou shall keep thy self well to set the upon a dog / And then the crow
said to the sheep / Think thou pour Innocent that I wot well with whom I
play / For I am old and malycious / and my kind is to let all Innocents /
and to be friend unto the euyls / Ad therefore this fable will tell and say /
how there be folk of such kind / that they will do no good werk / but only to
let ever the Innocents and simple folk

The xx fable makes mention of the tree and of the reed /

NOne ought to be proud against his lord / but ought to humble him self toward
him / As this fable reherceth to us of a great tree / which would never bow him
for none wynd / And a reed which was at his foot bowed him self as much as
the wynd would / And the tree said to him / why do thou not abide stylle as I
do / And the reed ansuerd / I have not the might which thou have / And the
tree said to the reed prowdly / than have I more strength / than thou / And
anon after came a great wind / which threw down to the ground the said
great tree / and the reed abode in his own being / For the proud shall be
allwey humbled And the meke and humble shall be enhannced / For the root of
all virtue is obedyence and humylyte

Here fynyssheth the fourth book of the subtyle Fables of Esope / And how be
it that moo of them ben not found in any Regystre / Nevertheless many other
fables composed by him / have ^^en founden which here after folowen
The first fable makes mention of the Mulet / of the fox / and of the wulf

MEn call many folk Asses / that been well subtyle / And such wenen to know
much / and to be a great clerk that is but an ass / As hit appiereth by this
(...) / Of a mule which ete grass in a medowe nyghe to a gre te forest / to
whom came a fox which demanded of him / what (...) thou / And the mule
ansuerd I am a be / And the fo^^ said to him / I ne demand ne ask of the
that / but I ask who was thy fader / And the Mule ansuerd / My great fader was
an horse / And the fox said again I ne demand to the that / but only that
thou tellest me / who thou art named / And the Mule said to the fox / I ne
wot / by cause I was little when my fader deyde / Nevertheless to the end that
my name should not be forgeten / my fader made hit to be wreton under my lift
foot behind / wherefore if thou wylt know my name / goo thou and look under
my foot /

And when the fox understood the fallace or falshede / he went again in to
the forest / And met with the wulf / to whom he said / Ha myschaunt be /
what do thou here / Come with me / and in to thy hand I shall put a good proy
Look in to yonder medowe / there shall thou find a fat be Of the which
thou may be filled / And then the wulf entryd in to the medowe / and fond
there the mule / Of whom he demanded / who art thou / And the mule ansuerd to
the wulf / I am a be / And the wulf said to him / This is not that that I
ask to the / but tell how thou art named / And the mule said I wot not /
but nevertheless if thou wylt kno we my name / thou shall find it wreton at my
lift foot be hynde / Then said the wulf / I pray the / wuchesauf to show
it to me / And the mule lift up his foot / And as the wulf beheld and studied
in the foot of the mule / the Mule gaf him such a stroke with his foot
before his forhede / that almost the brain ran out of his head / And the
fox whi che was within a busshe and saw all the manner began to lawhe and
mocque the wulf / to whom he said / Fool beeste thou wost well / that thou
can not read / wherefore if euylle is thereof come to the / thy self is cause
of hit / For none ought not to entremete him to do that / that Impossyble is
to him /

And therefore many ben deceived / that entremeteth them to do that / that they
may not do /

The second fable is of the bore and of the wulf
SOOthe desyren to be great lords / and dyspreysen his parents / that at the
last becomen pour and fallen in to great dishonor / As thou may see by this
present fable / Of a bore / which was among a great herd of other swynes /
And for to have lordship and domynacion over all them / he began to make
great rumor / and showed his great teethe for to make the other swynes aferd /
but by cause they knew him / they set naught by him / whereof he displeased
much / and would goo in to a herd of sheep / and emonge lambs / And when he
was among the lambs / he began to make great rumor / and showed his sharp
and long teeth And when the lambs herd him / they were sore aferd / and
byganne to shake for fere / And then said the bore within him self / here is
the place wherein I must abide and dueke For here I shall be gretely worshipped
/ For euerychone quaken for fere of me / Then came the wulf there for to have
and rauysshe sum proye / And the lambs began all to flee / but the bore
as proud would not sterr him / ne go fro the place / by cause he supposed to be
lord / but the wulf took him / and bare him in to the wode for to ete him / And
as the wulf bare him / it happed that he passid before the herd of swynes /
which the bore had left / And then when the bore perceived and knew them
/ he prayed and cried to them / that for the love of god they would help him /
And that without ^^er help / he was d^^d / And then the swynes all of one
assent and own will wont and recovered their felawe / and after slew the
wulf / And as the bore was delyuerd / and sa we him among the swynes / and
that all his doubt and fere was gone / he began to have vergoyne and shame
/ by cause that he was thus departed / and gone fro their felauship and said to
them / My brethren and my friends / I am well worthy to have had this pain /
by cause / I was gone and depar ted from you / And therefore he that is well /
let him beware / that he move not him self / For such by his pride desires
to be a great lord / which often falls in great pouerte /

The third fable is of the fox and of the cock /

OFtyme much talking lets / As hit appiereth by this fable / Of a fox /
which came toward a Cock / And said to him / I would feign wete / if thou
can as well sing as thy fader did / And then the Cock shette his eyes /
and began to cry and sing / And then the Fox took and bare him awey /
And the people of the town cried / the fox bears awey the cok / And then
the Cock said thus to the Fox / My lord understand thou not / what the
people says / that thou berest awey their cock / tell to them / that it is
thyn / and not theyrs / And as the fox said / hit is not yours / but it is mine
/ the ^^k s^^aped fro the fox mouth / and f^^ough upon a tree / And then
the Cok said to the fox thou lie / For I am theyrs and not thyn / And then
the fox began to hytte the earth both with his mouth and heed saying /
Mouth / thou have spoken to much / thou sholdest have eten the Cok / had not
be thyn over many words / And there for over much talkyng lets / and to
much crowynge smar^^ / therefore keep thy self fro over many words / to the end
/ that thou repentest the not

The fourth fable is of the dragon and of the ^^erle
MEn ought not to render euylle for good / And them that helpen ought not to be
let / As reherceth this fable Of a dragon which was within a River / and as
this River was dymynuyssled of water / the dragon abode at the Ryuage / which
was al dry / And thus for lack of watre he could not stere him / A labourer or
vylayne came then that way / and demanded of the dragon / what do thou
there / And the dragon ansuerd to him / I am here left without water /
without which I can not meue / but if thou wilt bynd me / and set me upon
thyn ass / and led me in to my River / I shall give to the habondaunce of gold
and silver / And the vylayne or chorle for couetyse bound and led him in to

payment / And the dragon said to him / By cause that thou have bounden me /
thou wylt be paid And by cause that I am now hongry / I shall ete the / And
the vylayne ansuerd and said / For to have done well / thou wylt ete and devour
me / And as they stryued to gyder / the fox which was within the forest herd
well their question and different came to them / and said in this manner /
Strive ye no more to gyder / For I will acord / and make pees bytwixt you ^^ate
each of you tell to me his reason for to wete / which of you has right / And
when each of them had told his caas the fox said to the vylayne / Show thou
to me / how thou boundest the dragon / to the end / that I may give thereof a
true and lawful sentence / And the vylayne put the dragon upon his ass / and
bound him as he had done before / And the fox demanded of the dragon / held
he then the so fast bounden / as he does now / And the dragon ansuerd / ye
my lord / and yet more hard / And the fox said to the vylayn / Bind him yet
more harder / For who that well byndeth / well can he vnbynd And when the
dragon was fast and well bounden / the fox said to the vylayne / bear him ageyn
there as thou first tokest him / And there thou shall leave him bounden as he is
n^^w / And thus he shall not ete ne devour the / For he that does euylle /
euylle he must have / For Justly he shall ben punysshed of god / they that done
harm and dommage to the pour folk For who so ever renders euylle for good /
he shall thereof just ly be rewarded


The v fable is of the fox and of the catte
THere is many folk / which auauncen them and say that they ben wise and
subtyle / which ben great fools and knowing no thing / As this fable
reherceth / Of a fox which sometime met with a Catte / to whom he sa yd /
My godsep / god give you good day / And the catte answered / My lord god give
you good life / And then the fox demanded of him / My godsep what can thou
do / And the catte said to him / I can lepe a lytyl / And the fox said to him
/ Certainly thou art not worthy to live / by cau se that thou can naught do
/ And by cause that the cat was angry of the foxes words / he asked and
demanded of the fox / And thou godsep what can thou do / A thousand wyles
have I said the fox / For I have a sak full of scyen^^ and wyles / And I am so
great a clerk / that none may begyle ne deceive me / And as they were thus
spekyng to gyder the cat perceived a knight coming toward them / which had
many dogs with him / and said to the fox / My godsep / cer taynly I see a
knight coming hytherward / which ledeth with him many dogs / the which as
ye well know ben our enemies / The fox then ansuerd to the cat / My godsep /
thou spekest like a coward / and as he that is aferd / let them come and care
not thou / And Incontynently as the dogs perceived and saw the fox and the
catte / they began to run upon them / And when the fox saw them come /
he said to the kat / Flee we my brother / flee we / To whom the kat ansuerd /
Certainly godsep / thereof is none need / Neuerthe les the fox byleued not the
cat / but fledd / and ran as fast as he might for to save him / And the catte
lepte upon a tree and saved him self / saying / Now shall we see / who shall
play best for to preserve and save him self / And when the catte was upon a
tree / he looked about him / and saw how the dogs held the fox with their
trethe / to whom he cried and said / O godsep and subtyle fox / of thy
thousand wyles that sith late thou coudest do / let me now see / and show to
me one of them / the fox ansuerd not / but was killed of the dogs send the
catte was saved / And therefore the wise ought not to disprayse the simple / For
such supposes to be much wise / which is a kind and a very fool /

The vj fable is of the hegoote and of the wulf

THe feeble ought not to arm him against the strong / As recyteth this present
fable of a wulf / which some time raune after a hegoot / and the hegoot for to
save him lept upon a roche / and the wulf besyeged him / And after when they
had duellid there two or three days / the wulf began to wexe hongry / and the
hegoote to have thurst / And thus the wulf went for to ete / and the hegoot
went for to drink / And as the hegoot drank he saw his shadow in the water
/ and speculynge and beholdynge his shadow proffered and said such words
within him self / Thou have so fair legs / so fair a berd / and so fair
horns / and have fere of the wulf / if hit happed that he come again / I
shall corryge him well / and shall keep him well / that he shall have no might
over me / And the wulf which held his peace / and herkened what he said / took
him by the one leg thus saying / what words ben these which thou proferest
and say brother Hegoote / And when the hegote saw that he was taken / he
began to say to the wulf / Ha my lord / I say no thing / and have pity of
me / I know well / that it is my coulpe / And the wulf took him by the neck and
strangled him / And therefore it is great folly when the feeble makes werre
against the puyssauut and strong

The vij fable is of the wulf and of the ass

MEn ought not to believe lightly the counceylle of him to whom men purposen to
let / As ye may see by thio fable / Of a wulf which sometime met with an
Ass / to the which he said / My brother I am hon^^ry / Wherefore I must needs
ete the / And then the Ass ansuerd right benyngly / My lord / with me thou
may do what someuer thou wylt / For if thou etest me / thou shall put me
out of great pain / but I pray the if thou wylt ete me / that thou
vouchesauf to ete me out of the way / For well thou know that I bring home
the raysyns fro the vine / and fro the feldes home the corn / Also well thou
know / that I bear home wood fro the forest / And when my master well do
buyld sum edyffy^^ / I must go fetch the stones from the montayne / And at
the other part I bear the corn unto the mylle / And after I bear home the
flower / And for all short conclusions I was borne in a cursyd hour / For to
all pain and to all great labors I am submytted and subget to hit / For the
which I will not that thou ete me here in the way for the great vergoyne and
shame that the ^^of might come to me / But I pray the / and Instantly require
the / that thou wylt here my counceylle / which is / that we two go in to the
forest / and thou shall bind me by the breast / as thy servant / and I shall
bynd the by thy neck as my master And thou shall led me before the in to the
wood where someuer thou wylt / to the end that more secretly thou ete me / to
the which counceylle the wulf acorded and said / I will well that it be done
so / And when they were come in to the forest / they bound each other in the
manner as above is said And when they were well bounden / the wulf said to the
Ass / goo we where thou wylt / and goo before for to show the way / And the
ass went before and led the wulf in to the right way of his masters hows
/ And when the wulf began to know the way / he said to the ass / We goo
not the right way / to the which the ass ansuerd / My lord say not that /
For certainly / this is the right wey / But for all that / the wulf would have
gone backward / But nevertheless the Ass led him unto the hows of his master
/ And as his master and all his meyny saw how the Ass drew the wulf after
him / and would have entered in to the hows* they came out with staves and
clubbes and smote on the wulf / And as one of them would have cast and smyten a
great stroke upon the wulfes heed / he brake the cord / wherewith he was
bounden / And so escaped and ran awey upon the montayne fore hurted and beten
/ And then the ass for the great joy that he had of that he was so escaped
fro the wulf / began to sing / And the wulf which was upon the montayne /
and herd the voys of thasse began to say in him self / thou may well cry
and call / For I shall keep the well another time / that thou shall not bynd
me as thou have done / but late gone / And therefore hit is great folly to
believe the counceylle of him / to whom men will let / and to put him self
in his subjection / And he that ones has begyled / must keep him fro another
time that he be not deceived / For he to whom men purposen to do sum euylle
tourn / sith men holden him at advantage / men must put hem self at the
upper side of him / And after men sha^^ purueye for their counceylle

The viij fable is of the serpent and of the labourer /

THe Auctor of this book reherceth such another Fable and of such sentence /
as the precydent / that is to wete / that men should not believe him / to whom /
men has done euylle / And says that sometime in heruest time a labourer went
for to see his goods in the feldes / the which met on his way a serpent /
And with a staf which he bare in his hand smote the said serpent / and gaf him
such a stro ke upon the heed / that nyghe he slew him / And as the Serpent
felt him self so sore hurted / he went fro the man / And entryd in to his
hole / And said to the labourer / O euylle Friend / thou have beat me / But I
warn the / that thou never believe not him / to the which thou have done any
euylle / Of the which words the labourer made lytyl extyme and went forth on
his way / It befelle then in the same year / that this labourer went again
by that way / for to goo labor and ere his ground / To whom the said
Serpent said / Ha my friend / whyther ghost thou / And the labourer answered to
him / I goo ere and plowe my ground / And the Serpent said to him / sow not to
much / For this year shall be raynfull and great habondaunce of waters shall
fall / But believe not to him / to whom thou have sometime done any euylle /
And without any words the labourer went forth on his way / and byleued not
the serpent / but made all his ground to be cultyued and ered / and sowed as
much corn as he might / In that same year fell great habondaunce of water /
wherefore the said labourer had but lytyl of his corn / For the most part of
the corn that he had sown perysshed that same year by cause of the great
rain that fell that same year / And the next year after following / as this
labourer passyd before the repair or dwelling place of the said Serpent and
went for to sow his ground / the Serpente demanded then of him / My Friend
whyther ghost thou / And the labourer answered / I goo for to sow my ground
with corn and with other gaynes such as I hope that shall ben necessary for
me in time coming / And then the Serpent said to him / My friend sow but
lytyl corn / For the Somer next coming shall be so^^ great and so hot /
that by the dryenes and hete / that all the goods sown on the earth shall
perysshe ^^ut believe not him / to whom thou have done any euylle / And
without saying any word / the labourer went / and thought on the words of
the Serpent / And wenynge / that the Serpent had so said for to deceive him
/ he sowed as much corn and other graynes / as he might / And it happed that
the Somer next following was such / as above is said / Therefore the man was
begyled / For he gadred that same year nothing / And the next year after
following / the said season as the pour labourer went again for to ere and
cultyue his ground the serpent saw him come fro far / And as he came and
passed before his re pair he asked of the labourer in such manner / My Friend
whyther ghost thou / And the labourer ansuerd / I goo cultyue and ere my ground
/ And then the serpent said to him / My Friend sow not to much ne to lytyl
of ^^ne and of other graynes / but sow between both / Nevertheless believe not
him / to the which thou have done evil And I tell the that this year shall
be the most temperate and the / most fertyle of all^^ manner of corn / that
ever thou saw / And when the labourer had herd these words / be went
his way / and did as the Serpent had said / And that year he gadred much good
/ by cause of the good disposycion of the season and time / And on a day of
the same year / the serpent saw the said labourer coming fro the heruest / to
whom he came ageynste / and said / Now say me my good Friend / Have thou not
fond now great plente of goods / as I had told to the before And the labourer
ansuerd and said ye certainly / whereof I thank the / And then the Serpent
demanded of him Re^^uneracion or reward / And the labourer then demanded
what he would have of him / And the Serpent said I n^^ demand of the nothing
/ but only that to morrow on the morning thou wylt send me a dyssh full of mylk
by some of thy children / And then the serpent showed to the labourer the hole
of his dwelling / and said to him / tell thy sone that he bring the milk
hither / but take good heed to that that other while I told to the / that thou
byleuest not him / to whom thou have done euylle / And anon after when
these things were said / the labourer went homeward / And in the morning
next following / he betoke to his sone a dysshe full of milk / which he
brought to the serpent / and set the dysshe before the hool / And anon the
serpent came out and slew the child through his Wnym / And when the labourer
came fro the feld / and that he came before the repair or dwelling of the
serpent / he fond his son which lay down deed on the earth / Then
began the said labourer to cry with a high wys / as he that was full of
sorrow and of heaviness saying such words / Ha cursyd and euylle serpent /
vermyn and falls traitor / thou have deceived me / Ha wicked and deceytfull
be / full of all contagyous evil thou have sorowfully slain my sone And
then the serpente said to him / I will well / that thou know / that I have
not slain him sorowfully / ne with out cause / but for to avenge me of that /
that thou hurtest me on that other day without cause / and have not amended
hit / Have thou now memory / how often I said to the / that thou sholdest not
believe him / to whom thou have done evil / have now then in thy memory /
that I am auengyd of the / And thus this fable shows how men ought not to
believe ne bear feythe to them / to whom men has done sum harm / (...)

The ix fable is of the fox / of the wulf / and of the Lion /
IF hit be so that any has been adommaged by other he ought not to take
vengeance by the tongue in gyuyng Iniuryous words / and the cause why / is by
cause / that such vengeance is dishonest. As to us reherceth this present
fable / Sometime was a fox / that ete fysshe in a River / It happed / that the
wulf came that way / And wh^^nne he saw the fox / which ete with so great
appetyte / He began to say / My brother give me sum fysshe / And the fox
ansuerd to him / Allas my lord / It behooves not that ye (...) the releef of my
table / but for the worship of your person I shall counceylle you well / Do
so much to get you a les (...) / And I shall teache you how men shall take
fysshes / to the end / that ye may take sum when ye shall be hongry / And the
wulf went in to the street / and stalle a basket / whi the ^^e brought with
him / the fox took the basket / and bound it with a cord at the wulfs taylle
/ And when he was well bounden / the fox said to the wulf / goo thou by the
River / and I shall led and take heed to the basket / And the wulf did as
the fox bad him do / And as the wulf was go^^nge within the water / the fox
filled the basket fulle of stones by his malice / And when the basket was full
/ the fox said to the wulf / Certainly my lord / I may no more lift ne hold
the basket / so full it is of fysshe / And the wulf wenynge that the fox had
said truth / profe^^rd such words / saying / I render graces and thanks to
god / that I may ones see thyn high and excellent wisdom in the art and
craft of fysshynge / And then the fox said to him / My lord abide me here /
And I shall fetch some to help us for (...) have and take the fysshe out of
the basket / And in saying these words / the fox ran in to the street /
where he fond men / to whom he said in this manner / My lords what do ye
here / why are you werkles / see yonder the wulf / which ete you^^ sheep / your
lambs / and your beestes / and yet now he takes your fysshes out of the
River / and ete them / And then all the men came to gyder / sum with
flynges / and sum with bows / and other with staves unto the River / where
they fond the wulf / which they beat outragyously / And when the pour wulf
saw him thus oppressyd / and vexed with strokes began with all his
strength and might to draw / and supposed to have carried the fysshe awey /
but so strongly he drew / that he drew and pulled his taylle fro his ers /
And thus he escaped uneath with his life / In the mean while then happed /
that the lion which was king ou^^r all beestes fell in a great sickness /
for the which cause every be went for to see him / as their lord / And
when the wulf would have gone thither / he salewed his lord / saying thus to him
/ My king I salewe you / please it you to know that I have gone round about
the country and prouynce / and in all places of hit for to search sum
medycynes profitable for you / and to recouere your health / but nothing I
have found good for your sickness / but only the skin of a fox fyers and
proud and malycious / which is to your body medycynal-but he daygneth not to
come hither to see you But ye shall call him to a counceylle / and when ye
hold him / let his skin be taken from him / And then let him run where
he will / and that fair skin which is so wholesome / ye shall make hit to be
set and bound upon your belly / And within few days after hit shall render
you in as good health / as every were / And when he had said these words /
he departed fro the lion and took his leave / but never he had supposed / that
the fox had herd him / but he had / For he was within a terryer nyghe by the
lodgys of the lion / where he herd all the proposycion of the wulf / to the
which he did put remedy and great prouysyon / For as soon as the wulf was
departed fro the lion / the fox went in to the feldes / And in a high way he
fond a great donghyll / within the which he put him self / And as he supposed
after hi^^ aduys to ^^e d^^fowled and dagged enough / came thus aryed in to the
pytte of the lion / the which he salewed as he ought^^ to have done to his
lord / saying to him in this manner / Sire king god give good health / And
the lion ansuerd to him God salewe the sweet friend / come nyghe me and kiss me
/ and after I shall tell to the sum secret / which I will not that
^^uery man know / to whom the fox said in this manner ^^a a sire king be not
displeased / for I am to foul arrayed and al to dagged / by cause of the great
way / which I have gone / seeking al about sum good medycyne for you /
Wherefore it behooves not to me / for to be so nyghe your person For the
scenche of the donge might well grieve you for the grede sickness that ye have /
but dear sire / if hit please to the / or ever I come nerer to thy Royal
mageste I shall goo bathe me and make me fair and clean / And then I shall
come again to present my self before thy noble person / And not
withstondynge all this / also or I goo / please the to wete and kno we that
(...) come from all the contrees here about / and from all the Royalmes
adjacent to this prouynce / for to see if I (...) find sum good medicine
dusynge and nedeful to thy sickness / and for to recouere thy health / but
certainly I have sound no better cou^ceylle than the cou^ceylle of an au^cyent
greek with a great and long berd / a man of great wysedom / sage and wa^^ thy
to be praised / the which said to me / how in this prouync^^ (...) a wulf
without taylle / the which has lost his taylle by the virtue of the great
medicine which is within him / For the which thing it is nedeful and
expedyent / that ye do make this wulf to come to you for the recoueraunce of
the health of your fair and nobl^^ body / And when ^^e is come dyssymylle and
call him to counceylle / saying that it shall be for his great worship and
prouffite / and as he shall be nyghe unto how case on him your armed feet / and
as swetely as ye may pulle the skin fro the body of him and keep it hoole /
sauf only that ye shall leave the heed and the feet / And then let him gone
his way to seche his adventure / And forthwith when ye shall have that skin /
al hot and warm ye shall do bynd hit al about your belly / And after that or
little time be passyd / your health shall be restored to you / and ye shall be
as hole as ever in your life ye were / And then the fox took his leave of the
king / and departed / and went again in to his ter ryer / Soon after came
there the wulf for to see the lion / And Incontinent the lion called him to
counceylle / and cas tynge softly his feet upon him dyspoylled the wulf of his
skin sauf the skin of his head and of his feet / And after the lion bound
it al warm about his belly / And the wulf ran aweye skynles / wherefore he
had enough to do to defend and put from him the flies / which grieved him
sore / And for the great distress that he felt by cause of the flies / that
thus ete his flesh / he as wood began to run / and pas syd under an hylle
/ upon the which the fox was / And af ter when the fox saw him / he
began to cry / and call / lawhyng after the wulf / and mocked / and said to
him / who art thou that passest there before with such a fair hood on thy
heed and with right fair glouues in thyn hands / Herke herke / what I shall
say to the / when thou went and came by the kings hows / thou were blessed
of the lord / and when thou were at the Court thou herkenest and also say
many good words and good talking of all the world / And therefore my godsep be
it evil or good / thou must al let pass / and goo / and have pacyence in
thyn aduersyte / And thus this fable shows unto us / that if any be hurted or
dommaged / by sum other he must not avenge him self by his tongue for to make
any treson / ne for to say of other any harm ne open blasphemye / For he ought
to consydere / that who so ever makes the pytte ready for his brother / often it
happe^^h that he him self falls in the same / and is beten with the same
rod that he makes for other

The x fable is of the wulf which made a fart /


IT is folly to wene more / than men ought to do / For what someuer a fool
thynketh-hit someth to him that it shall be / As it appiereth by this fable /
of a wulf / which sometime rose erly in a m^^nynge / And after that he was
risen up fro his bed / as he retched him self / made a gre (...) ^^art / and
began to say in him self / blessed be god therefore / these ben good tidings
/ this day / I shall be well fortunate and happy / as mine ers syngeth to me /
And then he departed from his lodgys / and biganne to walk and goo / and as
he went on his way he fond a sa^^ full of talowe / which a woman had let
fall / and with his foot he turned hit vpso down / and said to him / I
shall not ete the / For thou sholdest hurt my tender stomak / and that more
is / I shall this day have better mete / and more delycious / For well I know
this by mine er^^ / which did sing it to me / And saying these words went
his way / And anon after he fond a great pie (...) of bakon well salted / the
which he turned and returned vpso down / And when he had turned and
returned hit long / enough / he said / I dayne not to ete of this mete / by
cause that hit should cause me for to drink to much / for it is to salt And
as mine ers song to me last I shall ete this same day better and more
delycious mete / And then he began to walk ferther / And as he entryd in
to a fair medowe / he sa^^ we a mare / and her young fool with her / and said
to him self alone / I render thanks and graces to the gods of the gods that
they send me / For well I wist and was certain / that this day I should find
sum precious mete / And then he came nyghe the mare and said to her /
Certainly my sister I shall ete thy child / And the mare ansuerd to him / My
brother do what someuer hit shall please the / But first I pray the that one
playsyre thou wylt do to me / I have herd say that thou art a good Cyrurgyen /
wherefore I pray the / that thou wylt hele me of my foot / I say to the my
good bro der / that yesterdaye as I went within the forest / a thorn enteyd
in to one of my feet behynd / the which greueth me sore / I pray the / that
or thou ete my fool / thou wylt draw and have it out of my foot / And the
wulf answered to the mare that shall I do gladly my good suster / show me thy
foot / And as the mare showed her foot to the wulf / she gaf to the wulf
such a stroke bytwixe both his eyes / that all his head was astonyed and
fell down totheground / and by the same occasion was her fool or colt saved
/ And a long space was the wulf lyenge upon the earth / as deed / And when
he was come to him self again / and that he coud speak / he said / I care not
for this myshap / For well I wot that yet this day I shall ete / and be filled
of delycious mete / And in saying these words lift him self up / and went
aweye / And when he had walked and gone a while / he fond two rams within a
medowe which with their horns lau^ched each other / And the wulf said in him
self / Blessed be god / that now I shall be well fed / he then came nyghe
the two rams / and said / Certainly I shall ete the one of you two And one of
them said to him / My lord do all that it plese you / but first ye must give
to us the sentence of a process of a plee which is bytwixe us both / And the
wulf ansuerd / that with right a good will he would do hit / And after said to
them / My lords tell me your reson^^ and ^^as / to then^^ that the better I
may give the sentence of your different and question / And then one of them
began to say / My lord / this medowe was bylongynge to our fader / And by
cause that he deyde without mastynge any ordenaunce or testament / we be now
in debate and stryf for the partynge of hit / wherefore we pray the that thou
vouchesauf to accord our different / so that pees be made between us / And
then the wulf demanded of the rams how their question might be accorded /
Right well said one of them / by one manner / which I shall tell to the / if
hit please to the to here me / we two shall be at the two ends of this medowe
/ and thou shall be in the mids of it / And fro the end of the medowe / we
both at ones shall run toward the / And he that first shall come to the /
shall be lord of the medowe / And the last shall be thyn / well then said
the wulf / thyn aduys is good and well purposed / late set now who first shall
come to me / Then went the two rams to the two ends of the medowe / and
both at ones began to run toward the wulf / and with all their might came
and g^^f to him such two strokes both at ones against both his sides / that
almost they brake his heart within his belly / and there fill down the pour
wulf all aswowned / And the rams went their way / And when he was come
ageyn to him self / he took courage and departed / saying thus to him self / I
care not for all this Iniurye and shame / For as mine er^^ did sing to me /
yet shall I this day ete sum good and delycious mete / He had not long
walked / when he fond a sow / and her small pigs with her / And Incontinent
as he saw her / he said / blessed be god of that I shall this day ete and
fylle my belly with precious metes / and shall have good fortune / And in that
saying approached to the sow / and said to her / My suster I must ete sum of
thy young pigs And the sow went and said to him / My lord I am content of
all that / which pleases to you / But or ye ete them / I pray you that they
may be baptized and made clean in pure and fair water / And the wulf said to
the sow / Show me then the water / And I shall wasshe and baptyse them well
/ And then the sow went and led him at a stange or pond where as was a
fair mylle / And as the wulf was upon the lytyl bridge of the said mylle / and
that he would have take one pygge / the sow threw the wulf in to the water
with her hwde / and for the swyftnesse of the water / he must needs pass under
the whele of the mylle / And god wot if the wings of the mylle beat him well
or not / And as soon as he might / he ran away / And as he ran said to him
self / I care not for so lytyl a shame / ne therefore I shall not be let /
but that I shall yet this day ete my belly full of metes delycious / as myners
did sing it erly to me / And as he passed through the street / he saw sum
sheep / and as the sheep saw him / they entryd in to a stable / And when the
wulf came there he said to them in this manner / God keep you my susters / I
must ete one of you / to the end / that I may be filled and rassasyed of my
great honger / And then one of them said to him / Certainly my lord / ye are
welcome to pass / For we ben comen hyder for to hold a great solempnyte /
wherefore we all pray you / that ye pontyfycally will sing And after the
seruyse complete and done / do what ye will of the one of us / and then the
wulf for vayn glory / faynyng to be a prelate began to sing and to howl
before the sheep / And when the men of the tou^^e herd the Wys of the wulf /
they came to the stable with great staves and with great dogs / and wonderly
they wounded the wulf / and almost brought him to death / that with great pain
he could goo / Nevertheless he soaped / and went under a great tree / upon the
which tree was a man which hew of the bows of the tree / The wulf then
began to syghe sore / and to make great sorrow of his euylle fortune / and
said / Ha Jupiter how many euyls have I had and suffered this day / but well I
presume and know / that hit is by me and by mine own cause / and by my proud
thought / For the day in the morning I fond a sak full of talowe / the which
I dayned not but only smelle hit* And after I fond a great pyrce of bakon / the
which I would never ete for dread of great thurst and for my folysshe thought /
And therefore if euylle is syn happed to me / it is well bestowed and employed /
My fader was never medecyn ne leche / and also I have not studied and learned in
the science of medicine or phisyke / therefore if it happeth euylle to me /
when I would draw the thorn out of the mares fot^^ it is well employed /
Item my fader was never neither patryarke ne Bishop / And also I was never
bettred / and yet I presumed / and took on me for to sacryfyce and to sing be
fore the gods / faynyng my self to be a prelate / but after my deserte I was
well rewarded / Item my fader was no legist no never knew the laws / ne also
man of Justice / and to give sentence of a plee / I would entremete me / and
feigned my self great Iustycer / but I knew neither / a / ne / b / And if
therefore euylle is come to me / it is of me as of right it should be / O Iupyter
I am Worthy of gretter punycyon when I have offensed in so many manners /
send thou now to me from thyn high throne a swerd or other wepen / wherewith I
may strongly punysshe and beat me by great penance / For well worthy I am to
receive a gretter disciplyne / And the good man which was upon the tree /
herkened all these words and deuyses / and said no word / And when the wulf
had fynyssh^^d all his syghes and complayntes / the good man to ke his axe /
wherewith he had kytte awey the deed branches fro the tree / and cast it upon
the wulf / and it fell upon his neck in such manner that the wulf turned
vpsodoun the feet upward and say as he had been deed / And when the wulf might
res^^e and dress him self / he looked and byheld upward to the ^^uen / and
began thus to cry / Ha Jupiter I see now well that thou have herd and
enhaunced my prayer / And then he perceived the man which was upon the tree
/ and well wend that he had been Jupiter / And then with all his might he
fled toward the forest sore wounded / and rendered him self to humylyte / and
more m^^ke and humble he was afterward than ever before he had been fyers ne
proud / And by this fable men may know and see that much rests to be done
of that / that a fool thinks / And hit shows to us / that when sum good
comes to sum / it ought not be reffused / For it may not ben recouerd as
men will / And also it shows / hou none ought to auaunte him to do a thing
which he can not do / but therefore every man ought to govern and rewle him
self after his estate and faculte /

The xj fable is of the enuyous dog /

NOne ought not to have envy of the good of other / As it appiereth by this
fable / Of a dog which was ennyous / and that sometime was within a stable of
ox en / the Which was full of heye / This dog kept the oxen that they should
not enter in to their stable / and that they should not ete of the said hey /
And then the oxen said to him / Thou art well peruers and euylle to have
envy of the good / the which is to us needful and profitable / And thou
have of hit naught to do / for thy kind is not to ete no hey / And thus he
did of a great bone / the which he held at his mouth / and would not leave hit
by cause and for envy of another dog / which was thereby / And therefore keep
the well fro the company or felauship of an enuyous body / For to have to do
with him hit is much peryllous and dyffycyle / As to us is well shown by
Lucyfer

The xij fable is of the wulf and of the hongry dog /

S^^che supposen sometime to win that lesen / As hit appiereth by this Fable /
For hit is said comunly / that as much dispendeth the nygard as the large / As
hit appiereth by this Fable of a man which had a great herd of sheep / And
also he had a dog for to keep them fro the wulues / To this dog he gaf no
mete / for the great auaryce which held him / And therefore the wulf on a day
came to the dog / and demanded of him the rayson / why he was so lene / and
said to him / I see well that thou dyest for hon ger / by cause that thy master
gives to the no mete / by his gre te scarepte / but if thou wylt believe me I
shall give to the good counceylle / And the dog said to him / Certainly I
myster gretely of good counceylle / Then the wulf said to him / This shall
thou do / Let me take a lamb / And when I shall have hit I shall run
awey / And when thou shall see me run / make then semblau^t to run
after me / and let thy self fall faynynge that thou can not overtake me /
for lack and fawte of mete / which ma keth the so feeble / And thus when the
sheepherd shall see that thou may not have the lamb fro me by cause of the
gre te feblenesse and debylyte of thy lene body / he shall tell to thy lord
that thou myghtest not socoure the lamb / by cause that thou art so sore
ahongryd / and by this mean thou shall ha ue mete thy belly full / The dog
then acorded this with the wulf / and each of (...) made and did as above is
said / And when the sheepherd saw the dog fall / supposed well / that
honger was cause of it Forth which cause when one of the shepherdes came
home he told hit to his master / And when the master understood hit / he said
as a man wroth for shame / I will that fro hence forth on he have breed enough
/ And then every day the said dog had soppes of bread / and of dry
breed he had enough / Then the dog took strength / and vygour again /
It happed within a lytyl while after / that the wulf came again to the dog /
and said to him / I perceive well / that I gaf to the good counceylle / And the
dog said to the wulf / My brother thou say soothe / wherefore I thank the
much / For of hit I had great need /

And then the wulf said to him / If thou wylt I shall give to the yet better
counceylle / And the dog ansuerd him with right a good will I shall here
hit / And if hit be good I shall do after hit / Then said the wulf to him
Let me take yet another lamb / and do thy dylygence for to have hit fro me /
and to byte me / and I shall overthrow the thy feet upward / as he that has
no puyssaunce ne strength without hurtynge of thy self / believe me hardyly /
and well hit shall hap to the / And when thy masters servant shall have
seen thy dylygence / they shall show hit to thy master how that thou shall
keep full well his fold / if thou be well nourysshed / And then the dog
ansuerd to the wulf that he was content / And as hit was said / right so hit
was done / and both of them maad good dylygence The wulf bare aweye the lamb
/ and the dog ran after him / and ouertook him / and bote him fayntly / And
the wulf ouerthrewe the dog vpsodoune to the ground / And when the
sheepherdes saw give such strokes among the dog and the Wulf / said
Certainly we have a good dog / we must tell his dylygence to our master /
and so they did / and how he bote the wulf / and how he was overthrown / and
yet said Certainly if he had had ever mete enough / the wulf had not borne
awey the lamb / Then the lord commanded to gy ue him plente of mete /
whe^^f the dog took again al streng the and virtue / And within a while
after the wulf came again to the dog / and said to him in this manner / My
bro der have I not given to the good counceylle / And then the dog ansuerd
to him / Certainly ye / whereof I thank you / And the wulf said to the dog /
I pray the my brother and my good friend that thou wylt yet give another lamb /
and the dog said to him / Certainly my brother / well hit may suffyse the to
have had tweyne of them / Then said the wulf to the dog / At the lest way
I may have one for my labor and sallarye / That shall thou not have said the
dog / Have thou not had good sallarye for to have had two lambs ou^^ of
my masters herd / And the wulf ansuerd to him again / My brother give hit me
if hit please the / And after said the dog to him / Nay I will not / And if
thou take hit ageynste my will / I promytte and warn the / that never after
this time thou shall ete none / And then the wulf said to him / Allas my
brother I deye for honger / Counceylle me for goddys love what I shall do /
And the dog said to him / I shall cou^ceylle the well* a wall of my masters
celer is fallen down / go thither this night and enter in hit / and there thou
may both ete and drink after thy playsyr / For both breed flesh and wyn
shall thou find at plente there within / And then the wulf said to him /
Allas my brother / beware well then / that thou accuse ne deceive me not / And
the dog ansuerd / I waraunt the / but do thy faytte so pryuely / that none
of my felawes know not of hit / And the wulf came at the night / and entryd in
to the celer / and / ete and drank at his playsyre / In so much that he wexed
drunk / And when he had drunk so much / that he was drunk / He said to
him self / when the vylaynes ben filled with metes / and that they ben drunk
/ they sing their songs / and I wherefore should I not sing / And then he
began to cry and to howl / And the dogs herd the Wys of him wherefore they
began to bark and to howl / And the servant which herd them said / It is
the wulf / which is entryd within the celer / And then they al to gyder
wen^^n thither / and killed the wulf / And therefore more dispendeth the nygard
than the large / For auaryce was never good / For many one ben which dare not
ete ne drink as nature requires / But nevertheless every one ought to use and
live prudently of all such goods as god sends to him / This fable also she
weth to us / that none ought to do ageynste his kind / as of the wulf which
wexed drunk / for the which cause he was slain

The xiij fable makes mencyon of the fader and of his th^^ children
HE is not wise / which for to have vanyte and his plesyr takes debate or
stryf / As hit appiereth by this fable / Of a man which had three children /
and at the hour of his death he byquethed / and gaf to them his heritage or
lyue^^de / that is to wete a great pere tree / a got and a mylle / And when
the fader was deed / the brethren assembled them three to gyder / and went
before the Judge for to part their lyue^^de / and said to the Judge / My lord
the Judge / Our fader is deed which has byquethed to us three brethren al his
heritage and as much of hit should have the one as the other And then the
Judge demanded / what was their lyuelode / And they ansuerd a pere tree / a
got and a mylle / And then the Judge said to them / that they should set and
make parties egal of your lyuelede / and the one to have as much of hit as the
other / hit is a thing much dyffycyle to do / but to your aduys how should ye
part it / And then the eldest of the three brethren spoke and said / I
shall take fro the pere tree all that is crooked and vpryght / And the second
said / I shall take fro the pere tree all that is grene and dry / And the
third said I shall have all the rote / the pulle or maste and all the
branches of the pere tree / And then the Judge said to them / He that then
shall have the most part^^ of the tree / let him be Judge / For I ne none
other may know ^^e understand who shall have the moore or less part / And
therefore he that can or shall prove more openly / that he has the most part
shall be lord of the tree / And after the Judge demanded of them / how that
their fader had devised to them the got / And they said to him / he that
shall make the fairest prayer and request must have the got / And then the
first brother made his request / and said in this manner / would god that the
goot were now so great that she might drink all the water which is under
the cope of heaven / And that when she had dronken it / she should yet be
sore thursty The second said / I suppose that the got shall be mine / For a
fayrer demand or request than thyn is I shall now ma^^ / I would / that all
the hemp / and all the Flax and all the wulle of the world were made in
one thread alone / And that the Got Were so great / that with that same th^^de
men might not bind one of his legs / Then said the thirdde / yet shall
be mine the got / For I would / that he were so great / that if an Egle were
at the uppermost of the heaven / he might occupye and ^^aue then as much
place as the Egle might look and see in hight / in length and in breed / And
then the Judge said to them three / who is he of you three / that has maade
the fairest prayer / Certainly I no^^ none other can not say ne give the
Judgment / And therefore the good shall be bylongynge to him / that of hit
shall say the truth And the Mylle how was hit devised by your Fader for to
be parted among you three / And they ansuerde and said to the Judge / He that
shall be most liar / most euylle and most slow ought to have hit / Then
say the eldest sone / I am most slowfull / For many years I have dwelled in a
great hows / and lay under the conduytes of the same / out of the which
fell upon me all the foul waters / as pysse / dysshe water / and all other
fylthe that wonderly stanke / In so much that al my flesh was roten thereof /
and mine eyes al blind / and the dirt under my back was a foot high / And yet
by my great slouthe I had lever to abide there / than to turn me / and have
lift me up The second said / I suppose well / that the mylle shall be mine /
For if I had fasted twenty year / And if I had come to a table couerd of al
manner of precious and delycate me tes / whereof I might well ete if I would take
of the ^^st / I am so slothful that I may not ete without one should put
the mete in to my mouth / And the third said / the Mylle shall be mine / For
I am yet a gretter liar and more slothful / than any of you both / For if I
had been athurst unto the death / And if I found then my self within a fair
water unto the ne^^ / I would rather deye / than to me^^e ones my heed for to
drink thereof only one drop / Then said the Judge to them / Ye wot not what
ye say / For I nor none other may not well understand you / But the cause I
remytte and put among you three / And thus they went without any sentence /
For to a folysshe demand behooves a folysshe ansuere And therefore they ben
fools that will pl^^te such vanyte one ageynste other / And many one ben
fallen therefore in great pouerte / For for a lytyl thing ought to be made a
lytyl plee

The xiij fable is of the wulf and of the fox
NOne may not be master without he have be first a disciple / As hit
appiereth by this Fable / Of a Fox which came toward a wulf / and said to him
/ / My lord I proye you that ye will be my godsep / And the wulf ansuerd / I
am content / And the fox took to him his sone prayenge him that to his sone he
would show and learn good doctrine / the which the wulf took / and went with
him upon a montayne / And then he said to the little fox wharne the beestes
shall come to the feldes call me / And the (...) went and saw fro the top
of the hylle / how the beestes were coming to the feldes / and forthwith he
went and called his godfader / and said My godfader the beestes comen in to
the feldes / And the wulf demanded of him / what bestes are they / and the fox
ansuerd / they be both kyne and swyn to gy der / well said the wulf / I give no
force for them / let them go for the ^^gges ben with them / And soon after
the fox did look on another side and perceived the mare which went to the
feldes / and he went to his godfader and said / godfader the mare is go^^ to
the feldes / and the wulf demanded of him wh^^re abou^^ is she / And the fox
ansuerd she is by the forest / And the wulf said / Now go we to dinner / And the
wulf with his godsone entryd in to the wood / and came to the mare / The wulf
perceived well and saw a young colt / which was by his mother / the wulf took
him by the neck with his trethe and drew hit within the wood / and ete and
devoured him between them both / And when they had well eten the godson said to
his godfader / My godfader I commau^de you to god and much I thank you of
your doctrine / For well ye have taught me / in so much / that now I am a great
clerk / and now I will goo toward my mother / And then the wulf said to his
godson / My godsone if thou ghost awey / thou shall repent the therefore / For
thou have not yet well studied / and know not yet the Sylogysmes / Ha my
godfader said the Fox / I know well al / And the wulf said to him / Sithe thou
wylt goo / to god I command the / And when the Fox was come toward his
mother / she said to him / Certainly / thou have not yet studied enough / And he
then said to her / Mother I am so great a clerk that I can cast the deuylle
fro the clyf / ^^ete us go chase / and ye shall see if I have learned ought or
not / And the young fox would have done as his godfader the wulf deed / and said
to his mother / make good watch / And when the beestes shall come to the
feld / let me have thereof knowledge / And his mother said / well my sone / so
shall I do / She maade good watch / And when she saw that both kyne and
swyne went to the feldes / she said then to him. My sone the kyne and the
swyn to gyder ben in the feldes / And he ansuerd / My mother of them I retche
n^^t / let them goo / for the dogs keep them well / And within a short while
after / the mo der saw come the mare nyg^^e unto a wode / and went / and said
to her sone / My sone the mare is nyghe the wood. And he ansuerd / My mother
these ben good tidings / Abide ye here / For I goo to fetch our dinner / and
went and entered in to the Wode / And after would do as his godfader did before
/ and went and took the mare by the neck / But the mare took him with her
treth / and bare him to the sheepherd And the mother cried from the top of the
hylle / My sone let goo the mare / and come hyder again / but he might not /
For the mare held him fast with her teethe / And as the sheepherdes came for to
kylle him / the mother cried and said weeping / Allas my sone thou dydest not
learn well / and have ben to little a while at^^ scole / wherefore thou must now
deye myserably / And the sheepherdes took and slew him / For no ne ought to
say him self master without that he have first studied / For some wene to be
a great clerk / that can nothing of clergy /

The xv fable is of the dog / of the wulf and of the wheth^^r

Great folly is to a fool that has no might / that will begyle another
stronger tha^ him self / a^^ re^^ceth this fable of a fader of famylle which
had a great herd or (...) of sheep / and had a great dog for to keep them
which was well strong / And of his Wys all the wolves were aferd wherefore the
sheepherd slepte more surely / but it happed / that this dog for his great
age deyde / wherefore the sheepherdes we re sore troubled and wroth / and said
one to other / we shall no more s^^pe at our eas^^ by cause that our dog is
deed / for the wulues shall now come and ete our sheep / and then a great
wether fyers and proud / which herd all these worcester des came to them and said /
I shall give you good counceylle / Shave me / and put on me the skin of the
dog And when the wulues shall see me / they shall have great fere of me /
And when the wulues came and saw the wether clothed with the skin of the
dog / they began all to flee / and ran awey / It happed on a day that a
wulf which was sore hongry / came and took a lamb / and after ran away
therewith / And then the said wether ran after him / And the wulf which
supposed that it had been the dog shote thryes by the way for the great fere
that he had / And ran ever as fast as he could / and the wether also ran af
ter him without cesse / till that he ran through a busshe full of sharp
thorns / the which thorns rent and brake all the dogs skin / which
was on him / And as the wulf looked and saw behind him / being much doubtous
of his death / saw and perceived all the decepcion and falshede of the we
there / And forthwith returned ageynste him / and demanded of him / what be
art thou / And the wether ansuerd to him in this manner / My lord I am a wether
which plays with the / And the wulf said / Ha master ought ye to play with
your master and with your lord / thou have made me so so^^ aferd / that by the
weye as I ran before the / I dyte shyte three great toordes / And then the
wulf led him unto the place where as he had shyte / saying thus to him /
Look hither / call thou this a play / I take hit not for play / For now I
shall show to the / how thou ought not to play so with thy lord / And
then the wulf took and killed him / and denoured and ete him / And therefore
he that is wise must take good head / how he plays with him which is wyser
/ mo re sage / and more strong / than him self is /

The xvj fable makes mencyon of the man / of the lion and of his sone

HE that reffuseth the good doctrine of his fader / if evil hap comes to him
/ ^^t is but right / As to us reherceth this fable of a labourer / which
sometime lived in a deserte of his cultyuynge and labor / In this deserte was
a lion / which wa^^ed and destroyed all the sede / which eve ry day the said
labourer sewed / and also this lion destroyed his trees / And by cause that he
bare and did to him so great (...) and dommage / he made an hedge / to the
which he put and sort cords and nets for to take the lion / And ones as
this lion came for to ete corn / he entryd within a n^^te / and was taken /
And then the good man came thither / and beat and smote him so wonderly / that
uneath he might escape fro death / And by cause that the lion saw that he might
not escape the subtylyte of the man / he took his lytyl lion / and went to
dwell in another Regyon / And within a little while after that the lion was well
grown and was fyers / and strong he demanded of his fader / My fader be we
of this Regyon / Nay said the fader / For we ben fled awey fro our land /
And then the lytyl lion as^^ed / wherefore / And the fader ansuerd to him /
For the subtylyte of the man / And the lytyl lion demanded of him what man is
that / And his fader said to him / he is not so great ne so strong as we be /
but he is more subtyle and more Ingenyous / than we he / And then said the
sone to the fader / I shall goo avenge me on him And the great lion said to him
/ goo not / For if thou ghost thither thou shall repent the therefore / and shall
do like a fool And the sone ansuerd to his fader / Ha by my heed I shall goo
thither / and shall see what he can do / And as he went for to find the man
/ he met an ox within a medowe / and an horse whose back was al fleyen / and
fore / to whom he said in this manner / who is he that has led you hyder /
and that so has hurted you / And they said to him / It is the man / And then
he said again to them / Certainly / here is a wonder thing / I pray you /
that ye will show him to me And they went and showed to him the labourer /
which ered the earth / And the lion forthwith and without saying of any moo
words went toward the man / to whom he said in this manner / Ha man thou have
dove over many euyls / both to me and to my Fader / and in like wise to our
beestes / wherefore I tell the that to me thou wylt do Justice / And the man
ansuerd to him / I promytte and warn the / that if thou come nyghe me I shall
slay the with this great clubbe / And after with this stuyf I shall flee the /
And the lion said to him / Come then before my fader / and he as king shall
do to us good Justice / And then the man said to the lion / I am content /
if that thou wylt swear to me / that thou shall not touch me / till that we
ben in the presence of thy fader / And in like wise I shall swear to the /
that I shall go with the unto the presence of thy fader / And thus the lion and
the man swered each one to other / and went toward the great lion / and the
man began to goo by the way where as his cords and nets were dressyd / And
as they went / the lion let him self fall within a cord / and by the feet
he was take / so that he might not ferther goo / And by cause he could not goo
he said to the man / O man I pray the that thou wilt help me / For I may no
more goo / And the man answered to him / I am sworn to the that I shall not
touch the unto the ty me that we ben before thy fader / And as the lion supp^^
to have vnbonnd him self for to escape / he fylle in to another net And then
the lion began to cry after the man / saying to him in this manner / O good
man I pray the that thou will vnhynde me / And the man began to smite him
upon the head / And then when the lion saw that he might not escape / he
said to the man / I pray the / that thou smite me no more upon the heed / but
upon mine erys / by cause that I would not here the good counceylle of my fader /
And then the man began to smite him at the heart and slew him / The which
thing happeth often to many children which ben hanged or by other manner
executed and put to death / by cause that they will not believe the doctrine of
their faders and moders / ne obey to them by no wise

The xvj fable is of the knight and of the servant / the which fond the Fox
/

MAny ben that for their great lesynges supposen to put under all the world /
but ever at the last their lesynges ben known and manyfested / as hit
appiereth by this fable of a knight which sometime went with an archer of his
through the land / And as they rode / they fond a Fox And the knight said to
his archer / In good soothe I see a great Fox / And the Archer began to say
to his lord / My lord / merueylle ye thereof / I have been in a Regyon where as
the Foxes ben as great as an ox / And the knight ansuerd In good soothe their
skynnes were good for to make mantels with / if skynners might have them / And
as they were riding / they fell in many words and deuyses / And then by
cause the knight perceived well the lesynge of his Archer / he began to make
prayers and orysons to the gods / for to make his Archer aferd / And said in
this manner / O Jupiter god almighty / I pray the / that this day thou wylt
keep us fro all lesynges / so that we may sauf pass this flood and this great
River which is here before us / and that we may surely come to our hows / And
when the Archer herd the prayer and oryson of his lord / he was much
abashed And then the Archer demannded of him / My lord where fore prayest
thou now so deuoutely / And the knyt ansuerd wost thou not well that hit is well
known and manyfested / that we soon must pass a right great River / And that
he who on all this day shall have made any lesynge / if he enter in hit / he
shall never come out of hit again / of the which words the Archer was
much doubtous and dredeful / And as they had ryden a lytyl way / they fond a
lytyl River / wherefore the Archer demanded of his lord / Is this the flood
which we must pass / Nay said the knight / For hit is well gretter / O my lord
I say by cause that the fox which ye sa we may well have swymmed and passed
over this lytyl wa ter / And the lord said / I care not therefore / And after
that they had ryden a lytyl ferther / they fond another little River / And the
Archer demanded of him / Is this the flood that ye spoke of to me / Nay said
he / For hit is gretter and more broad / And the Archer said again to him / My
lord I say so / by cause that the Fox of the which I spoke of to day was not
gretter than a calf / And then the knight herkyng the dyssymylacion of his
archer / answered not / And so they rode forth so long that they fond yet
another River / And then the Archer demanded of his lord / Is this the same
hit / Nay said the knight / but soon we shall come there to / O my lord I say
so by cause that the Fox whereof I spak to you this day / was not gretter than
a sheep / And when they had ryden unto even time they fond a great River and of
a great vrede / And when tharcher saw hit / he began al to shake for fere /
and demanded of his lord / My lord is this the River / ye said the knight / O
my lord I ensure you on my feythe / that the Fox of the which I spoke to day
/ was not gretter than the Fox / which we saw to day / wherefore I knowledge
and confess to you my sin / And then the knight began to smyle / and
said to his Archer in this manner / Also this River is no wore than the other
which we sa we to fore and have passed through them / And then the archer had
great vergoyne and was shameful / by cause that he might no more couere his
lesynge / And therefore hit is fair and good for to say ever the truth / and
to be true both in speech and in deed / For a liar is ever begyled / and his
lesynge is known and manyfested on him to his great shame and dommage

the flee The xvj fable is of the husbond and of his two wives The xvij fable is
of the labourer and of his children
The first fable is of the Egle and of the raven

NOne ought to take on him self to do a thing / which is peryllous without
he feel him self strong ynou to do hit / As reherceth this Fable / Of an Egle
/ which fleyncte took a lamb / whereof the Raven had great envy wherefore
upon another time as / the said raven saw a great herd of sheep / by his great
envy and pride and by his great oultrage descended on them / and by such
fachon and manner smote a wether that his clowes abode to the flies of hit / In
so much that he could not flee awey / The sheepherd then came and brake and
took his wings from him / And after bare him to his children to play them
with / And demanded of him / what byrd he was / And the Raven ausuerd to him /
I supposed to have been an Egle / And by my ouerwenynge I wend to have take a
lamb / as the egle did / but now I kno we well that I am a Raven / wherefore the
feeble ought not in no wise to compare him self to the strong / For sometime
when he supposes to do more than he may / he falls in to great dishonor /
as hit appiereth by this present Fable / Of a Raven / which supposed to have been as strong as the egle

The second Fable is of the egle and of the wesel

NOne for what so ever might that he have / ought not to dispreyse the other /
As hit appiereth by this present fable of an Egle / which chaced sometime after
an hare And by cause that the hare might not resyste ne withstand a geynst the
egle / he demanded aid and help of the wesel / the which took him in her
keeping / And by cause that the egle saw the wesel so lytyl / he dispreysed
her / and before her took the hare / whereof the wesel was wroth / And therefore
the wesell went / and beheld the Egles nest which was upon a high tree / And
when she saw hit / the little wesell clymmed upon a tree and took and cast
down to the ground the young egles wherefore they deyde / And for this cause was
the Egle much wroth and angry / and after went to the god Jupiter And prayed
him that he would find him a sure place where as he might leye his eggs and
his lytyl chykyns / And Jupiter granted it / and gaf him such a gift / that
when the time of childynge should come / that she should make her young Egles
within his bosom / And then when the wesel kno we this / she gadred and
assembled to gyder great quantite of ordure or fylthe / and thereof made an
high hylle for to let her self fall fro the top of hit in to the bosom of
Jupiter / And when Iupyter felt the stenche of the fylthe / he leganne to
shake his bosom / and both the wesel and the eggs of the egle fell down to
the earth / And thus were all the eggs broken and bost / And when the Egel
knew hit / she made anowe / that she should never make none egles / till of the
wesel she we re assured / And therefore none how strong and mighty that he be /
ought not to dispreyse sum other / For there is none so lytyl / but that
sometime he may let and avenge him self / wherefore do thou no displaysyr to
none / that displaysyre come not to the

The thyrdde fable is of the Fox and of the got

HE which is wise and sage ought first to look and be hold the end / or he
begins the work or deed / as hyer appiereth by this fable / Of a Fox and
of a got / that sometime defanded and went down in to a deep well / for to
drink. And when they had well drunk / by cause that they ^^oude not come
upward again / the Fox said to the got in this manner / my friend if thou wylt
help me / we shall sone ben both out of this well / For if thou wylt set
thy two feet ageynste the wall / I shall well lepe upon the / and upon thy
horns And then I shall lepe out of this well / And when I shall be out
of hit / thou shall take me by the hands / and I shall pluck and draw the
out of the well / And at this request the got / acorded and ansuerd / I
will well / And then the got lift up his feet against the wall / and the
fox did so much by his malice that he gat out of the well / And when he was
out / he began to look onthectote / which was within the well / and then
the got said to him / help me now as thou have promised / And then the fox
began to lawhe and to scorn him / and said to him / O master goote / if
thou had be well wise with thy fair berde / or ever thou had entryd in
to the well / thou sholdest first have taken head / how thou sholdest have
comen out of hit again / And therefore he which is wise / if he wisely will
gouer ne him self / ought to take ever good head to the end of his work

The fourth fable is of the catte and of the chyken

HE which is false of kind / and has begone to deceive some other / ever he
will use his craft / As it appiereth by this present Fable of a kat which
sometime took a chyken / the which he biganne strongly to blame / for to have
fond sum cause that he might ete hit / and said to him in this manner / Come
hither thou chyken / thou do none other good but cry all the night / thou
letest not the men sleep / And then the chykyn ansuerd to him / I do hit for
their great prouffite / And over again the catte said to him / Yet is there
well wors / For thou art an inceste and lechour For thou know naturelly both
thy mother and thy daughter And then the chyken said to the cat / I do hit by
cause that my master may have eggs for his etynge / And that his master for
his prouffyte gaf to him both the mother and the daughter for to multyplye the
eggs / And then the Catte said to him / by my feythe godsep thou h^^t of
excusacions enough / but nevertheless thou shall pass through my throat / for I
suppose not to fast this day for all thy words / And thus is it of him
which is custommed to live by rauyn / For he can not keep ne absteyne him self
fro hit / For all thex cusacions that be leyd on him

The v fable is of the Fox and of the busshe

MEn out not to deman^de ne ask help of them that been more customed to let
than to do good or prouffit / as it appears by this fable of a fox which for
to escape the peril to be taken went upon a thorn busshe / which hurted him
sore / and weeping said to the busshe / I am come as to my refuge unto the /
and thou have hurted me unto the death / And then the busshe said to him /
thou have erred / and well thou have begyled thy self / For thou supposest to
have taken me as thou art custommed to take chekyns and hens / And there fore
men ought not to help them which ben acustomed to do euylle / but men ought
rather to let them

The vj fable is of the man and of the god of the wodes
OF the euylle man sometime prouffiteth so^me other / he does hit not by his
good will / but by force / As reherceth to us this fable / Of a man which had
in his hows an ydolle the which oftyme he adoured as his god / to whom often
he prayed that he would give to him much good And the more that he prayed him /
the more he faylled / and became pouere / wherefore the man was well wroth
against his ydolle / and took hit by the legs / and smote the head of hit so
strongly against the wall / so that it brake in to many pyeces / Out of the
which ydolle issued a right great tresoure / whereof the man was full glad and
Joyous / And then the man said to his ydolle / Now know I well / that thou
art wicked / evil and peruers / For when I have worshipped the / thou have
not helped me / And now when I have beat the / thou have much done for me /
And therefore the euylle man when he does any good / it is not of his good
will / but by force /

The vij fable is of a fyssher
All things which ben done and made in their time and se ason ben well made /
as by this present fable it appears Of a fyssher which sometime touched his
bagpype nyhe the River for to make the fysshe to daunse / And when he saw that
for none fonge that he could pype / the fysshes would not dau^se / As wroth did
cast his nets in to the River / and took of fysshe great quantite / And
when he had draw out his net^^s out of the water / the fysshe began to
lepe and to dau^ se / and then he said to them / Certainly hit appiereth now
well / that ye be euylle beestes / For now when ye be taken / ye lepe and
daunse / And when I pyped and played of my muse or bagpype ye dayned / ne
would not daunse / Therefore hit appiereth well that the things which ben made
in season / ben well made and done by reason

The eight fable is of the catte and of the rat
HE which is wise / and that ones has been begyled / ought not to trust more
him that has begyled him As wherceth this Fable of a catte which went in to
a hows / where as many rats were / the which he did ete each one after other /
And when the rats perceived the great fyersnes and crudelyte of the catte /
held a counceylle to gyder where as they determined of one common will / that
they should no more hold them ne come nor goo on the low floor* wherefore one
of them most ancient proffered and said to all the other such words / My
brethren and my friends / ye know well / that we have a great enemy / Which
is a great persecutour over us all / to whom we may not resyste / wherefore of
need we must hold our self vppn the high balkes / to the end that he may not
take us / Of the which proposycion or words the other rats were well content
and apayd / and byleuyd this counceylle / And when the kat knew the
counceylle of the rats / he hynge him self by his two feet behynd at a pynne of
iron which was styked at a balke / feynynge him self to be deed / And when
one of the rats lokynge dounward saw* the katte began to lawhe and said to
the cat / O my Friend if I supposed that thou were deed / I should goo down /
but well I know the so falls and peruers / that thou may well have hanged thy
self / faynynge to be deed / wherefore I shall not go down / And therefore he
that has been ones begyled by sum other / ought to keep him well fro the same

The ix fable is of the labourer and of the pyelarge

HE which is taken with the wicked and evil out to suffer pain and punycyon
as they / As it appiereth by this fable / Of a labourer which sometime dressyd
and set his gynnes and nets for to take the ghees and the cranes / Which
ete his corn / It happed then that ones among a great meyny of ghees and
cranes / he took a pyelarge / which prayed the labourer in this manner / I pray
the let me go / For I am neither goos ne crane nor I am not come byther for to
do to the any euylle / The labourer began then to law^^ / and said to the
pyelarge / if thou had not be in their felauship / thou had not entryd
in to my nets / n^^ had not be taken / And by cause that thou art found
and taken with them / thou shall be punysshed as they shall be Therefore none
ought to hold company with the euylle without he will suffer the punycion of
them which ben punysshed

The tenth fable is of the child / which kept the sheep

HE which is acustommed to make lesynges / how be it that he say truth /
yet men believe him not / As reherceth this fable / Of a child which sometime
kept sheep / the which cried often without cause / saying / Alla^^ for
gods love so^^ure you me / For the wulf will ete my sheep / And when the
laborers that cultyued and ered the earth about him / herd his cry / they
came to help him / the which came so many times / and fond nothing / And as
they saw that there were no wulues / they returned to their labourage / And
the child did so many times for to play him / It happed on a day that the wulf
came / and the child cry ed as he was acustommed to do / And by cause that the
laborers supposed / tha^^ hit had not ben truth / abode stylle at their
labor / wherefore the wulf did ete the sheep / For men by leave not lightly him
/ which is known for a liar

The xj fable is of the ante and of the columbe

NOne ought to be slowful of the good which he receives of other / As
reherceth this fable of an Ante / which came to a fontayne for to drink / and
as she would have drunk she fell within the fontayn / upon the which was a
columbe or douue / which seeing that the Ante should have been drowned without
help / took a branch of a tree / and cast it to her for to save her self /
And the Ante went anon upon the branch and saved her / And anon after came
a Fawkoner / which would have take the douue / And then the Ante which saw
that the Fawkoner dressyd his nett^^s came to his foot / and so fast pryked
hit / that she caused him to smite the earth with his foot / and therewith made
so great noise / that the down herd hit / wherefore she fl^^whe aweye o^^ the
gynne and nets were al set / And therefore none ought to forgete the
benyfyce which he has received of some other / fo^^ slowfulnesse is a great
sin

The xij fable is of the Be and of Jupiter

NOw the evil which men wysshe to other / comes to him which wyssheth hit /
as hit appiereth by this fable / of a Be which offered and gaf to Iupyter a
pyece of honey / whereof Iupyter was much Joyous / And then Iupyter said to
the be / demand of me what thou wylt / and I shall grant and give hit to
the gladly / And then the Be prayed him in this manner / God almighty I pray
the that thou wylt give to me and grant / that who so ever shall come for to
take awey my honey / if I pryke him / he may suddenly deye / And by cause that
Iupyter loved the humayn lyg nage he said to the Be / Suffyse the / that who
so ever shall goo to take thy honey / if thou pryke or stynge him / Incontinent
thou shall deye / And thus her prayer was turned to her great dommage / For
men ought not to demand of god / but such things that been good and honest

The xiij fable is of a carpenter

IN as much as god is more propyce and b^^nygne to the good and holy / much
more he punyssheth the wyc ^^d and euylle / As we may see by this fable / Of a
carpenter which cut wode upon a River for to make a temple to the gods /
And as he cut wode / his axe fell in the River / wherefore he began to weep
and to call help of the gods / And the god Mercurye for pity appiered
before him And demanded of him wherefore he wept / and showed to him an axe of
gold / and demanded of him if hit was the axe which he had lost / and he said
nay / And after the god showed to him another axe of silver / And semblably
said nay And by cause that Mercurius saw that he was good and true / he drew
his axe out of the water / and took hit to him with much good that he gaf to
him / And the carpenter told thystorye to his felawes / of the which one of
them came in to the same place for to cut wood as his felawe did before / E
let fall his axe within the water / and began to weep and to demand the
help and aid of the gods / And then Mercury appiered to fore him / and
showed to him an axe of gold / and demanded of him in such manner / Is the
same hit that thou have lost / And he ansuerd to Mercury / ye fair sire and
mighty god the same is it / And Mercury s^^ynge the malice of the vylayne gaf
to him ueyther the same ne none other / and left him weeping / For god which
is good and Just rewarded the good and true in this wo^^ / or each other after
his deserte and punyssheth the euylle and Unjust

The xiiij fable is of a young thief and of his mother

HE which is not chastysed at the beginning is ^^uyll and peruers at the end
/ As hit appiereth by this fable of a young child which of his yongthe
began^^e to stele / and to be a thief / And the theftys which he maad / he
brought to his mother / and the mother took them gladly / and in no wise she
chastysed him / And after that he had done ma ny theftys / he was taken / and
condemned to be hanged / And as men led him to the Justice / his mother
followed him and wept sore / And then the child prayed to the Justice / that
he might say one word to his mother / And as he approuched to her / made
semblaunt to tell her sum words at her ere / and with his treth he bote of
her nose / whereof the Justice blamed him / And he ansuerd in this manner / My
lords ye have no cause to blame me therefore / For my mother is cause of my death
For if she had well chastysed me / I had not come to this sha me and vergoyne /
For who loves well / well he chastyseth / And therefore chastyse well your
children / to the end / that ye fall not in to such a caas

The xv fable is of the flee and of the man /

HE that (...) the evil / how be hit that the euylle be not gre te men ought
not to leave him unpunished / As it ap pyereth by this fable / Of a man which
took a flee whi che bote him / to whom the man said in this manner / Fle why
bytest thou me / and letest me not sleep / And the flee ansuerd It is my kind
to do so / wherefore I pray the that thou will not put me to death / And the
man began to lawhe / and said to the flee / how be it / that thou may not
hurt me sore / N^^uertheles / to the behooves not to prycke me / wherefore thou
shall deye / For men ought not to leave none evil unpunished how be hit that
hit be not great (...) for (...) (...)

The xvj fable is of the husbond and of his two wives

No thing is werse to the man than the woman / As it appears by this fable /
of a man of a mean age / which took two wives / that is to wete an old / and
one young / which were both dwelling in his hows / and by cau se that the old
desired to have his love / she plucked the blak herys fro his head and his
berde / by cause he should the more be like to her / And the young woman at the
other side plucked end drew out all the white herys / to the end / that he
should seem the younger / more gay and fayrer in her syghte / And thus the good
man abode without any here on his head And therefore hit is great folly to
theauncyent to wedde them self again / For to them is better to be unwedded /
than to be ever in trouble with an evil wife / for the time in which they should
rest them / they put it to pain and to great labor

The xvij fable is of the labourer and of his children

HE that labors and werketh contynuelly may not faylle to have plente of
goods / as it appiereth by this present fable / Of a good man labourer /
which all his life had labored and wrought / and was rich / And when he should
deye / he said to his children / My children I must now deye / And my tresour
I have left in my vine / And after that the good man was deed / his children
which supposed that his tresour had been in the vine / did nothing al day but
delued hit / and it bare more fruit than did before / For who trauaylleth well
/ he has ever bread enough for to ete / And he that werketh not dies for
honger

fable is of a vylayne / and of a young bole The xxij fable is of a pilgrim and
of the satyr The xxiij fable is of an ox and of the ratte The xxiiij fable is
of the ghees and of her lord The xxv fable makes mention of the ape and of his
two children The xxvi fable is of the wynd and of the pot The xxvij fable is
of the wulf and of the cheuerel or lytil goot
The first fable is of the old woman and of the wulf
MEn ought not to believe on al manner spyrytes / As reherceth this fable of an
old woman / which said to her child because that it wept / certeynly if thou
wepst any more / I shall make the to be ete of the wulf / and the wulf heryng
this old woman / abode still to fore the yate / and supposed to have eten the
old woman's child / and by cause that the wulf had so long tarried there that
he was hongry / he returned and went again in to the wood / And the shewulf
demanded of him / why have thou not brought to me some mete / And the wulf
ansuerd / by cause / that the old woman has begyled me / the which had
promised to me to give to me her child for to have ete him / And at the last I
had hit not / And therefore men ought in no wise to trust the woman / And he
is well a fool that sets his hope and trust in a woman / And therefore trust
them not / and thou shall do as the sage and wise

The second fable is of the tortose and of the other birds
HE that enhaunceth him self more than he ought to do To him ought not to
come no good / As hit appiereth by this present fable / Of a tortose / which
said to the birds / if ye lift me up well high fro the ground to the air I
shall show to you great plente of precious stones / And the Egle took her and
bare her so high / that she might not see the earth / And the Egle said to
her show me now these precious stones that thou promysest to show to me / And
by cause that the tortose might not see in the earth / and that the Egle knew
well that he was deceived / thrested his clowes in to the tortoses belly / and
killed hit / For he that will have and get worship and glory may not have
hit without great labor / Therefore hit is better and more sure / to keep him
lowely than to enhaunce him self on high / and after to deye shamefully and
myserably / For men sayn comynly / who so mounteth hyher / than he should / he
falls lower than he would

The third fable is of the two Creuysses
HE which will teache and learn some other / ought first to corryge and examyne
him self / as it appears by this fable of a creuysse / which would hauec
hastysed her own daughter because that she went not well right /



And said to her in this manner / My daughter / hit pleases me not that thou
ghost thus backward / For euylle might well thereof come to the / And then the
daughter said to her mother My mother I shall go right and forward with a good
will but ye must goo before for to show to me the way / But the mother could
none other wise goo / than after her kind / wherefore her daughter said unto her
/ My mother first learn your self for to goo right and forward / and then ye
shall teache me And therefore he that will teache other / ought to show good
ensample / For great shame is to the doctor when his own coulpe or fault
accuses him

The fourth fable is of the ass / and of the skin of the Lion
NOne ought not to gloryfye him self of the goods of other as recyteth this
fable of an ass which some time fo nd the skin of a lion / the which he did
and wered on him / but he could never hyde his eres therewith / and when he was
/ as he supposed well arrayed with the said skin / he ran in to the forest /
And when the wyld (...) saw^^ him come / they were so ferdfull that they all
began to flee / For they wend / that it had be the lion / And the master of
the ass ser^^d and sought his ass in every place al about And as he had
sought long / he thougiht that he would go in to the forest for to see if his
ass were there / And as soon as he was entryd in to the forest / he met
with his ass arrayed as before is said / but his master which had sought him
^^onge saw his erys / wherefore he knew him well / and anon^^ took him / and
said in this manner / Ha a master ass / ar^^ thou c^^othed with the skin of
the lion / thou make the (...) stes to be aferd / but if they knew the / as
well as I do / then should have no fere of the / but I ensure the / that well I
shall* beat the therefore / And then he took fro him the skin of the lion /
and said to him Lion shall thou be no more / but an ass shall thou ever be /
And his master took then a staf / and smote him / so that ever after he
remembryd him well of hit / And therefore he which auaunceth him self of other
men's goods is a very fool / For as men sayn comynly / he is not well arrayed
nor well appointed / which is clothed with others gown / ne also it is not
honest to make large ^^onges of other men's leder

The v fable is of the frogge and of the Fox

NOne ought to auaunce him self to do that which he be can not do / As hit
appiereth of a frogge / which sometime issued or came out of a dyche / the
which presumed to have lepte upon a high montayne / And when she was upon
the montayne / she said to other beestes / I am a maystresse in medecyn / and
can give remedy to al manner of sekenes by mine art / and subtylyte / and
shall render and bring you up again in good health / whereof sum byleued
her / And then the Fox which perceived the folysshe believe of the beestes /
began to lawhe / and said to them / pour beestes / how may this foul and
venomous be which is seek and pale of color render and give to you health
/ For the leche which will hele sum other / ought first to hele him self /
For many one counterfayteth the leche / which can not a word of the science of
medecyne / from the which god preserve and keep us

The vj fable is of the two dogs

HE that takes within him self vain glory of that thing / by the which he
should humble him self is a very fool / as hit appears by this fable / of a
fader of famylle / which had two dogs / of the which the one without any
barkyng bote the folk / and the other did bark and bote not / And when the
fader of famyll perceived the shrewdnes and malice of the dog that barkyd not
he henge on his nest a belle / to the end that men should beware of him /
wherefore the dog was over proud and fyers / and began to dyspreyse all the
other dogs / of the which one of the most aun^^en* said to him in his
manner / O fool be / now perceive I (...) thy folly and great wodenesse to
suppose / that this belle is given to the for thyn own deserte and merit /
but certainly hit is not so / For hit is taken to the for thy demerytes / and
by cause of thy shrewdness / and great treason / for to show / that thou art
falls and traitor / And therefore none ought to be Ioyeful and gladd of that
thing / whereof he ought to be tryst and sorrowful / as many foles done /
which make Joy of their vices and evil deeds / for a much fool were the
thief which that men led for to be hanged / and that he had a cord of gold
about his neck / if he should make Joy thereof / how be hit that the cord were
much rich and fair

The vij Fable is of the camel and of Jupiter

EWery creature ought to be content of that / that god has given to him
without to take thenherytaunce of other / As reherceth this fable Of a camel
which some time complained him to Jupiter of that the other beestes mocqued him
/ by cause that he was not of so great beauty / as they were of / wherefore to
Jupiter Instantly he prayed in such manner as follows / Fair sire and god / I
require and pray that thou wylt give to me horns / to the end that I may be
no more mocqued / Jupiter then began to lawhe / and instead of horns / he
took fro him his erys / and said / thou have more good than hit behooves to the
to have / And by cause that thou demaundest that / which thou ought not to
have I have take fro the that which of right and kind thou outest to have /
For none ought not to desire more than he ought to have / to the end that he
lose not that which he has /

The eight fable is of the two felawes.

MEn ought not to hold felauship with him / which is acustommed to begyle
other / As hit appiereth by this Fable / Of two felawes which sometime held
felauship to each other for to goo both by montaynes and valeyes / And for to
make better their vyage / they were sworn each one to the other / that none
of them both should leave other unto that the time of death should come and
depart them / And as they walked in a forest they met with a great wyld bear
/ and both felaws ran sone awey for fere / of the which the one clym med upon
a tree / And when the other saw that his felawe had left him leyd him self on
the earth / and feigned to be deed / And Incontinent the bear came for to ete
him / but by cau se the gallaunt played well his game / the bear went forth his
way and touched him not / And then his felawe came down fro the tree which
said to him / I pray the to tell me what the b^^re said to the / For as me
seems he spoke to the / and has showed to the great sign or token of love /
And then his felawe said to him / He taught to me many fair secrets / but
emonge all other things he said to me / that I should ne uer trust him who
ones has deceived me

The ix fable makes mention of the two pottes

THe pour ought not to take the Rich as his felawe As it appiereth by this
fable of two pottes / of the which the one was coper / and the other of earth
/ the which pottes did mete to gyder within a River / and by cause that the
erthen pot went swyfter than did the coper pot / the pot of coper said to
the pot of earth / I pray the that we may goo to gyder / And the erthen pot
ansuerd and said to the coper pot / I will not go with the / For it should
hap to me as it happed to the glass and of the mortar For if thou shol dest
mete with me / thou sholdest break and put me in to pie ces / And therefore
the pour is a fool that compares and lykeneth him self to the rich and
mighty / For better is to live in pouerte than to deye vylaynsly and be
oppressyd of the rich

The x fable is of the lion and of the boole

IT is not alweye time to avenge him self of his enemy / As it appiereth by
this fable of a bole / which sometime fled before a lion / And as the bole
would enter within a cauerne for to save him / a got went ageynste him for to
keep and let him that he should not enter in it / to whom the bole said / It
is not time now to avenge me on the / for the lion that chaseth me / but the
time shall come that well I shall find the / For men ought not to do to him
self dommage for to be auengyd of his enemy / but ought to look time and place
couenable for to do hit

The xj fable is of the ape and of his sone

NO fowler a thing is to the man / than with his mouth to preyse him self / As
this fable reherceth to us / Of Jupiter king of all the world / which maade
all the beestes and all the birds to be assembled to gyder for to know
their lounte / and also their kind / Emonge all the which came the Ape /
which presented his sone to Jupiter / sa yenge thus / Fair sire and mighty
god / look and see here the fairest be that ever thou createst in this world
/ And Iupi ter then began to lawhe / and after said to him / thou art well
a foul be to preyse so thy self / For none ought to preyse him self / but
ought to do good and vertuons were kes / whereof other may preyse him / for it
is a shameful thing to preyse him self

The xij fable is of the crane and of the pecok

FOr what virtue that any man has / none ought to preyse him self / As hit
appiereth by this fable / Of a pecok / which sometime made a dinner to a crane /
And And when they had eten and dronken enough / they had great words to
gyder / wherefore the pecok said to the crane / Thou have not so fair a form
ne so fair a figure as I have / ne also fair fe hers / ne so resplendysshynge
as I have / To whom the crane ansuerd / and said / It is truth / Nevertheless
thou have not one good / ne one fo fair a virtue as I have / For how be hit
that I have not so fair feathers as thou have / yet can I flee better than thy
self do / For with thy fair feathers thou must ever abide on the earth / And
I may flee where someuer hit pleases me / And thus euerychone ought to have
suffysaunce and to be content of that / that he has / without auanncyuge or
praysynge of him self / and not to dyspreyse none other

The xiij fable is of the hunter and of the tygre

WErse is the stroke of a toncte / than the stroke of a spear as hit appiereth
by this fable / Of a hunter / which with his arowes hurtrd the wyld beestes /
in such wise that none scoped fro him / to the which bestes a tygre fyers and
hardy said in this manner / Be not aferd / For I shall keep you well / And as
the Tygre came in to the wode / the hunter was hyd within a busshe / the which
when he saw pass the tygre before the busshe / he shote at him an arowe / and
hytte him on the thye / wherefore the tygre was gretely abashed And weeping and
sore syghynge said to the other beestes / I wot not from whens this comes to
me / And when the fox saw him sooo gretely abashed / al lawhynge said to
him / Ha a tygre / thou art so mighty and so strong / And then the tygre
said to him / My strength auaylled me not at that time / For none may keep him
self fro treason And therefore some secret is here / which I knew not before
But notwithstanding this I may well conceive / that there is no wors arowe /
ne that lets more the man / than tharowe which is shot fro the evil
tongue / For when some person profereth or says some words in a felauship /
of sommen a of honest and good life / all the felauship supposes that that whi
che this euylle tongue has said be true / be hit true or not / how be it
that it be but lesynge / but notwithstondynge the good man shall ever be
wounded of that same arowe / which wound shall be Incurable / And if hit /
were a stroke of a spear / hit might be by the Cyrurgyen heled / but the stroke
of an euylle tongue may not be heled / by cause that Incontinent as the word is
proffered or said / he that has said hit / is no more master of hit / And for
this cause the stroke of a tongue is Incurable and without guaryson

The xiiij fable is of the four oxen
MEn ought not to break his feythe ageynste his good Friend / ne to leave his
felauship / as hit appiereth by this fable / of four oxen which to gyder were
in a fair medowe / And by cause that ever they were and kept them to gyder /
none other be durst not assaylle them / and also the lion dradde them much
/ the which lion on a day came to them / And by his deceyuable words
thought for to begyle them / and to rauysshe and take them the better / maade
them to be separed each one fro other / And when they were (...) / the lion
went / and took one of them / And when ^^he lion would have strangled him /
the ox said to him / godse^^ / He is a fool / which byleueth falls and
deceyuable words And leueth the felawship of his good friend / For if we had
^^en ever to gyder / thou had not taken me / And therefore he which is /
and stands well sure / ought to keep him so that he fulle not / For he which
is well / meue not him self

The xv fable is of the busshe / and of the aubyer tr^^e
NOne for his beauty ought not to dispreyse some other / For sometime such one
is fair that soon wexeth lothely and foul / and to high falls unto low /
as it apperyth by this fable / Of a fair tree / which mocqued and scorned a
lytyl busshe / and said / See thou not / my fair form and my fair figure
/ And that of me men and byldeth fair edefyces as palace and castellis /
galeyes and other ships for to saylle on the sea / And as he auaunced and
preysed him self thus / came there a labourer with his axe for to hew and
smite him to the ground / And as the labourer smote upon the fair tree / the
busshe said / Certainly my brother if now thou were as little / as I am / men
should not hew ne smite the down to the earth / And therefore none ought to
reioysshe him self of his worship / For such is now in great honor and
worship / that herafter shall fall in to great vytupere shame and dishonor

The xvj fable is of the fyssher and of the lytyl fysshe
MEn ought not to leave that thing which is sure and cer tayne for hope to
have the uncertain / as to us reherceth this fable of a fyssher which with his
line took a little fysshe which said to him / My friend I pray the / do to me
none euylle / ne put me not to death / For now I am naught / for to be eten /
but when I shall be great / if thou come again hither / of me shall thou
mow have great auaylle / For then I shall goo with the a good while / And
the Fyssher said to the fysshe. Syn I hold the now / thou shall not escape fro
me / For great folly hit were to me for to seek the here another time / For men
ought not to let goo that / of what they be sure of / hoping to have
afterward that that they have not and which is uncertain

The xvij fable is of Phoebus / of the Auarycious / and of the enuyous
NOne ought to do harm (...) dommage to sum other for to receive or do
his own dommage / As hit appears by this fable / Of Jupiter which sent
phoebus in to ther^^he for to have all the knowledge of the thout of me^^



This phoebus then met with two men / of which the one was much enuyous /
And the other right covetous / Phoebus demanded of them what their thought was
/ We think said they to demand and ask of the great yeftes / To the which
Phoebus ansuerd / Now demand what ye will / For all that that ye shall
demand of me / I shall grant hit / And of that / that the first of you
shall ask / the second shall have the dowble part / or as much more again /
And then the auarycious said / I will that my felawe ask what he will first
whereof the enuyous was well content / which said to P^^ebus Fair sire I pray
the that I may lose one of mine eyes / to the end that my felawe may lose al
both his eyes / wherefore phoebus began to lawhe which departed and went
again un to Jupiter / and told him the great malice of the enuyous / which
was Ioyeful and glad of the harm and dommage of an other / and how he was well
content to suffer pain for to have a dommaged sum other


The xviij fable is of the thief / and of the child which wept
HE is a fool that puts his good in Ieopardy to lose it for to get and have
some others good / as it appears by this fable of a thief which fond a child
wepyuge be side a well / of whom the thief vyde ask why he wept / and the
child answered to him I weep / by cause that I have let fall within this well
a boket of gold / and then the thief took of his clothes / and set them on
the ground and went down in to the well / And as be was down the child took
his gown and left him within the well / And thus for couetyse to win / he
lost his gown / For such supposen to win sometime which losen / And
therefore none ought to wysshe that / that he has not / to the end that he
leseth not that / that he has / For of the thing wrongfully and euylle gotten
/ the third heir shall never be possessour of hit


The xix fable is of the lion and of the got
HE is wise that can keep him self from the wyly and falls / as hit appears by
this fable / Of a lion / which ones met with a got / which was upon a
montayne And when the lion saw her / he said to her in this manner / for to
give to her occacion to come down fro the hylle / to the end that he might ete
her / My suster why come thou not hyder on this fair and grene medowe for to
ete of these fair herbs or grass / And the got ansuerd to him / How be hit
/ that thou say truth / Nevertheless thou say it not / neither for my we
le ne for my prouffyte / but thou say hit / by cause that thou would feign
ete and devour me / but I trust not in thy fair speech / For many times I
have herd say of my grant mother / he that is well / meue not him self / For he
which is in a place well sure / is well a fool to go fro hit / and to put him
self in great danger and peril

The xx fable was of the crow which was a thurst


BEtter is craft and subtylyte than force / As reherceth to us this fable / Of
a crow which upon a day came for to drink out of a boket / and by cause
that she might not reche to the water / she did fill the boket full of small
stones / in so much that the water came upward / whereof she drank then at
her will / and playsyre / And therefore hit appiereth well / that wit or
sapyence is a much fair virtue For by sapyence or wit / thou shall mow
resyste to all faults /

The xxj fable is of the vylayne and of the young bole /
HE which is of euylle and shrewd kind / with great pain he may chasty him
self / as it appears by this fable / Of a vylayne / which had a young bole /
the whi che he might not bynd / by cause that ever he smote with his horns /
wherefore the vylayne cut of his horns / But yet when he would have bound him /
the bole casted his feet fro him / in such wise that he suffered noman to come
nyghe him / And when the vylayne perceived the malice of the bole / he said to
him / I shall chastyse the well / For I shall take the in to the bouchers
hands / And then was the bole well chastysed / And thus ought men to do of
the euylle / cursyd and rebels / which do no thing but play with dees and
cards and to ruffule / Such folk ought men to put in to the hands of the
boucher for to lead them to the galhows / For better may no man chastyse them /
For with great pain may he be chastysed / which flees all good works and
all good felauship

The xxij fable is of the viator or palmer and of Satyr
MEn ought to beware and keep him self from him which bears both fire and
water / as reherceth to us this Fable Of a pilgrim / which sometime walked in

couerd all the ways / he wist ne knew not whyther he went / ageynste the
which came a wodewose named Satyr by cause he saw him a cold / which
approached to the pilgrim and brought him in to his pytte / And when the pilgrim
saw him / he had great dread by cause that a wodewose is a monstre like to
the man / as hit appiereth by his figure / And as the wodewose or Satyr led
the pilgrim in to his pytte / the pilgrim did blow within his hands for to
chausfe them / For he was sore acold / And then the wodewose gaf to him hot
water to drink / And when the pilgrim would have dronken hit / he began to
blow in hit / And the wedewose demanded of him / why he did blow hit / And
the pilgrim said to him / I blow in hit / for to have it somewhat more cold
than hit is / The wodewose then said to him / Thy felauship is not good to me
/ by cause that thou wrest both the fire and the water in thy mouth /
therefore go hens fro my pyt and never return again / For the felauship of the
man which has two tongues is naught / And the man which is wise ought to
flee the felauship of flaterers / For by flateryng and adulacion many have been
begyled and deceived




The xxiij fable is of the ox and of the rat
THe lords ought to love their subgettis / For he which is hated of his
tenaunts and subgets / is not lord of his land / as hit appears by this Fable
/ Of an ox / which sometime was within a stable / and as the ox on a time
would have slepte feign / a rat came / which bote the ox by the thyes / And as
the ox would have smyten him / he ran away in to his hole / And then the ox
began to menace the rat / And the ratte said to him / I am not aferd of the
For all be hit that I am lytyl / I may let and empeche the / And if thou art
great / thy parents ben cause thereof and not thy self / And therefore the
strong ought not to dispreyse the feeble / vnt ought to love him as the chyef
or head ought to love his lymmes / For he that loves not / ought not to be
loved / And therefore the lord must love his subgettys / if of them he will be
loved

The xxiiij fable is of the goos and of her lord


HE that over ladeth him self / is euylle strayned / As this fable says / of a
man / which had a goos / that leyd every day an egg of gold / The man of
auaryce or covetousness commanded and bad to her / that every day she should
leye two eggs / And she said to him / Certainly / my master I may not /
wherefore the man was wroth with her / and slew her / wherefore he lost that
same great good / of the which deed he was much sorrowful and wroth / how be
it that it was not time to shetle the stable when the horses ben lost / and
none / And he is not wise / which does such a thing / whereof he shall
repent him afterward / ne healso / which does his own dommage for to avenge
him self on sum other / For by cause that he supposes to win al / he
leseth all that he has

The xxv fable is of the ape and of his two children

HE that sometime men dispreysen / may well help sum other / as hit appears
by this Fable of an Ape / which had two children / of the which he hated the
one / and loved the other / which he took in his arms / and with him fled

which the she ape held in her arms empeched her to flee / she let hit fall
to the earth / And the other which the mother hated held fast and was saved /
the which from thens forthon kyssed and embraced his mother / And And she
then began to love him / wherefore many times it happeth / that that thing

For sometime the children which ben preysed and loved / done less good than
they which ben dispreysed and hated

The xxvj Fable is of the wynd and of therthen pot

The second fable is of the commyssion of pecuny(...) money

A Spaynard arrived sometime in to the land of egipte And by cause that he
doubted to be robbed within the desertys of Arabe / he purposed and bethought

to stepe hit unto his return again / And by cau se that he herd sum say /
that within the Cite was a true man / he anon went to him / and took to him
his silver for to keep hit / And when he had done his vyage / he came again to
him / and demanded of him his silver / which ansuerd to him in this manner /
My friend / Ine wot who thou art / for I saw the never that I wot of / And
if thou say or spekest any more words / I shall make the to be well beat /
Then was the spaynard sorrowful and wroth / and thereof be would have made a
playnte to his neighbors / as he did / and the neighbors said to him
Certainly / we be well abashed of that / that ye tell to us / for he is emonge
us all reputed and holden for a good man and true / And therefore return
again to him / and by sweet words tell him that he will render to the thy
good again / the which thing he did / and the old man ansuerd to him more
sharply and rygorously / than he had done before / whereof the spaynard was
wonderly wroth / And as he departed out of the old man's hows / he met with
an old woman / the which demanded of him / wherefore he was so troubled and
heavy / And after that he had told to her the cause why / thold woman said to
him / make good chere / For if hit be so as thou say / I shall counceylle
the how thou shall recouere thy silver / And then he demanded of her / how
hit might be done / And she said to him b^^yng hither to me a man of thy
country whom thou trustest / and do to be made four fair chestes / and fylle
them all with stones / and by thy felawes thou shall make them to be borne /
in to his hows / and to him they shall say / that the marchau^ts of spain
send them to him for to be kept surely / And when the chestes shalt be within
his hows / thou shall go and dema^ de of him thy silver / which thing he did
/ And as the said chestes were borne within his hows / the spaynard went with
them / that bare them / the which strangers said to the old man My lord /
these four chestes ben al full of gold / of silver and o^^ precious stones /
which we bring to you / as to the trewest man and feythful that we know for
to stepe them surely by cause that we fere and doubt the thieves / which ben
within the desert / After the which words said / came he / which the old
woman had counceylled / and demanded of him his silver And by cause that the
old man doubted / that the spaynard would have dispreysed him / he said thus to
him / Thou art welcome / I merueylled how thou taryest so long for to come /
And Incontinent he restored to him his silver / And thus by the counceylle of
the woman which he gretely thanked / he had his good ageyn / and returned
again in to his country /

The third fable speaks of a subtyle Inuencion of a sentence given upon a
derke and obscure cause


HIt befelle sometime that a good man labourer went fro life to death / the
which labourer left nothing to his sone / but only a hows / the which sone
lived by the (...) of his hands pourely / This young man had a neygh^^ur which
was much rich which demanded of the said young man if he would selle his hows
/ but he would not selle it / by cau se that it was come to him by enherytau^ce
and by patrimony wherefore the rich man his neybour connersyd and was fuloft
with him for to deceive him / but the young man fled his company as much as he
might / and when the rich man perceived that the young man fled from him / he
bithout him self of a gre te dece^^on and falshede / and demanded of the pour
young man that he would hyre to him a part of his hows for to delue and make a
celer / the which he should hold of him payeng to him yearly rent / and the
pour young man hired it to him / and when the celer was made / the rich man
did do bring therein x to^nes of oylle of the which the v were full of oylle /
and the other v were but half full / and did do make a great pytte in the earth
/ and did do put the five tonnes which were half full in hit / and the other
five abo^^e them / And then he shytte the door of the celer / and delyuerd
the keye to the pour young man / and prayed him frawdelently to keep well his
oylle / but the pour young man knew not the malice and falshede of his
neighbor / wherefore he was content to keep the keye / And within a why le
after as the oylle became dear / the rich man came to the pou re / and asked
of him his good / and the young man took to him the keye / this Rich man
then sold his oylle to the merchants / and warauntysed each tonne al full /
And when the merchants mesured their oylle / they fond but five of the x
tonnes full / whereof the rich man demanded of the pou re young man
resticucion / and for to have his hows he maade him to come before the Judge /
And when the pour man was before the Judge / he demanded term and space for
to answer / For him thought and seemed that he had kept well his oylle / and
the Judge gaf and granted to him day of aduys / and then he went to a
philosophre which was procuratour of the pour people / and prayed him for
charity / that he would give to him good cou^ceylle at his great need / and he
reherced and told to him al his cause and swore upon the holy euangely that he
to ke none of the rich man's oylle / And then the philosopher ansuerd to him
in this manner / My sone / have no fere / for the truth may not faylle / And
the next morrow after / the philo sopher went with the pour man in to
Judgment / the which Philosopher was constitued by the king for to give the
Just sentence of hit / And after that the cause had be well deffended and pleted
of both parties / the philosophre said / the same rich man is of good
renommee / and I suppose not that he demanded more than he should have / And
also I believe not / that this pour may be maculed ne gylty of the blame /
which he puts on him / but notwithstondynge for to know the truth of hit
/ I ordeyne and give sentence / that the oylle pu re and clean of the v tonnes
which are full to be mesured / and also the lie thereof / And after that the
pure and clean oylle of the five tonnes which ben but half full to be also
mesured with the lie thereof / and that men look if the lie of the five Tonnes
half full is egal and like to the lie of the five Tonnes / which ben fulle /
And if hit be not so / that as momoche lie be fond within the vessels which
ben but half full as in the other / he shall then be suffysauntly and
ryghtwysly proved / that none oil has be taken out of them / but if there be
fond as much lie in the one as in the other / the pour shall be condemned /
and of this sentence the pour was content / and the truth was known /
wherefore the pour man went quyte / and the rich was condemned / For his
great malice and falsheed was known and manyfested / For there is no sin or
mysdede done / but that ones it shall be known and ma nyfested

The fourth fable makes mention of the sentence given up the pecuny or money
which was found

A Rich man sometime went by a Cite / And as he wall ked fro one side to that
other / fylle fro him a great purse / wherein were a thousand crowns / the
which a pour man fond / and took them for to keep to his wife / whereof she was
full glad / and said / thanked be god of all the goods which he sends to us
/ if he sends now this great sum keep we hit well / And on the next m^^ne
after following / the Rich man made to be cried through the Cite / that who
someuer had fond a thousand Crowns in a purse / he should restitue / and bring
them to him again / and that he should have for his reward an honderd of them /
And after that the pour man had herd this cry / he ran Incontinent to his
wife / and said to her / My wife / that / that we have found must be rendered or
yolden again / For hit is better to have a C crowns without sin than a
thousand with sin and wrongfully / And how be hit that the woman would have
resysted / Nevertheless in the end she was content / And thus the pour man
restored the thousand crowns to the Rich / and demanded of him his honderd
crowns / And the rich full of frawde or falshede said to the pour / thou
rendrest not to me al my gold / which thou fondest / For of hit I lack four
honderd pyeces of gold And when thou shall render and bring to me ageyn the
said four honderd pyeces of gold / thou shall have of me the C crowns / which
I promised to the / And then the pour ansuerd to him / I have take and
brought to the all that I have found / wherefore they fylle in a great dyfferent
or stryf / in so much that the cause came before the king / to be decyded and
pletyd / of the which the king made to be called before him a great
philosopher which was procuratour of the poures / And when the cause was well
dispnted / the philosopher moved with pity / called to him the pour man / and
to him said in this manner / Come hither my friend / by thy feythe have thou
restored all that good which thou fondest in the purse / and the pour
ansuerd to him / ye sire by my feythe / And then the philosophre said before
thassistantes / Sith this rich man is true and feythfull / and that hit is
not to believe / that he should demand more than he ought to do / he ought to
be by leued / And as to the other part men must believe that this pour man is
of good renomme and known for a true man wherefore the philosopher said to the
king / / Sire I give by my sentence / that thou take these thousand crowns /
and that an C thou take of them / the which honderd thou shall delyuere to
this pour man which fond them / And after when he that has lost them shall
come / thou shall restore them to him / And if it happeth that another person
find the thousand and four C crowns / they shall be rendryd and taken ageyn to
the same good man which is here present which says that he has lost them /
the which sentence was much agreeable and ple saunt to all the company / And
when the rich man saw that he was deceived / he demanded myseryoorde and
grace of the king saying in this manner / Sire this pour man that has fond
my purse / trewely he has restored it to me all that I out to have / but
certainly I would have deceived him / wherefore I pray the that thou wylt have
pity and myserycorde on me And then the king had myseryoorde on him / And
the pour man was well contented and paid / and all the malice of the rich man
was known and manyfested

The v fable is of the feythe of three felawes

Often it happeth that the evil which is procured to other comes to him
which procures it / as hit apperyth by the felawes / of the which tweyn were
burgeys / and the third a labourer / the which assembled them to gydre for to
go to the holy sepulcre / This three felawes made so great prouysyon of flour
for to make their pylgremage / in such wise / that it was al chauffed / and
consumed / except only for to make one loef only / And when the Burgeis saw
the end of their flower they said to gyder / if we find not the manner and
cautele for to begyl^^ this vylayn / by cause that he is a right great gallaunt
/ we shall deye for hongre / wherefore we must find the manner and facyone that
we may have the loof which shall be maad of all our floor / And therefore
they concluded to gy der and said / when the loof shall be put within the
oven we shall goo and leye us for to sleep / and he that shall dreme best /
the loof shall be his / And by cause that we ^^he ^^n subtyle and wise / he
shall not mow dreme as well as we shall / whereof the ^^of shall be ours /
whereof all they three were well content / and al byganne to sleep /

But when the labourer or vylayne knew and perceived all their fallace /
and saw that his two felawes we re a sleep / he went and drew the loof out
of the oven and ete hit / And after he feigned to be a sleep / And then one of
the burgeys rose up / and said to his felawes / I have dremed a wonder dreme /
For two Angels have taken and borne me with great Joy before the dyuyn mageste
/ And the other burgeys his felawe awoke and said / Thy dreme is merueyllous
and wonderful / but I suppose that the mine is fayrer / than thyn is / For I
have dremed that two Angel^^ drew me on hard ground for to lead me in to hell
/ And after they did awake the vylayne which as dredeful said / who is there /
and they ansuerd / we be thy felawes / And he said to them / how be ye so
soon returned / And they answered to him / how returned / we departed not yet
fro hens / And he said to them by my feythe / I have dremed that the Angels had
led one of you in to paradys or heaven / and the other in to hell / Wherefore I
supposed / that ye should never have comen again / And therefore I aroos me fro
sleep / and by cause I was hongry / I went and drew out of the oven the leef
and ete hit / For often hit happeth that he which supposes to begyle sum
other / is him self begyled

The vj fable is of the labourer and of the nyghtyngale

Sometime there was a labourer / which had a gardeyn well playsaunt and much
delycious / in to the which he often went for to take his disporte and
playsyre / And on a day at even when he was weary and had trauaylled sore / for
to take his recreacion he entryd in to his gardyn and set him self down
under a tree / where as he herd the song of a nyghtyngale / And for the great
plesyre and Joy which he took thereof / he sought and at the last fond the
means for to take the nyghtyngale / to the end / that yet gretter Joy and
playsannce he might have of hit / And when the nyghtyngale was take / he
demanded of the labourer / wherefore have thou take so great pain for to take
me / For well thou know that of me thou may not have great prouffyte / And
the vylayne ansuerd thus to the nyghtyngale / For to here the song of the I
have taken the / And the nyghtyngale ansuerd Certainly in vain thou have
payned and labored / For / for no good I will sing while that I am in prison
/ And then the labourer or vylayne ansuerd / if thou syngest not well / I
shall ete the / And then the nyghtyngale said to him / if thou put me
within a pot for to be soden / lytyl mete shall thou then make of my body /
and if thou set me for to be roasted / less mete shall be then made of
me / And therefore neither boylled ne roasted shall not be thy great belly filled
of me / but if thou let me flee / it shall be to the a great good and
prouffyte / For three doctrynes I shall teache the which thou shall love better
than three fat kyne / And thine the labourer let the nyghtyngale flee / And
when he was out of his hands / and that he was upon a tree / he said to the
vylayne in this manner / My Friend I have promised to the / that I shall give to
the three doctrynes / whereof the first is this that thou believe no thing which
is Impossyble / The second is that thou keep well that thyn is / And the third
is / that thou take no sorrow of the thing lost which may not be recouerd /
And soon after the nyghtgngale began to sing / and in his song said thus /
blessed be god / which has delyuerd me out of the hands of this vylayne or
chorle / which has not known / seen / ne touched the precious dyamond which
I have within my belly / For if he had found hit / he had be much rich / And
fro his hands I had not escaped / And then the vylayne which herd this song
/ began to complain and to make great sorrow, and after said I am well
unhappy / that have lost so fair a tresour / which I had won / and now I
have lost hit / And the nyghtyngale said then to the chorle / Now know I well
that thou art a fool / For thou take sorrow of that whereof thou sholdest
have none / and sone thou have forgeten my doctrine / by cause that thou wenest
that with in my belly should be a precious stone more of weight than I am / And I
told and taught to the / that thou sholdest never believe that thing / which
is Impossyble / And if that stone was thyn / why have thou lost it / And if
thou (...) lost it and may not recouere hit / why take thou sorrow for hit
/ And therefore hit is folly to chastyse or to teache a fool / which never
byleueth the learning and doctrine which is given to him

The vij fable is of a Rethorycian and of a crowkbacked /

A Philosopher said ones to his sone / that when he were fall by fortune in to
sum dommage or peril / the sooner that he might he should delyuere him of
hit / to the end / that afterward he should no more be vexed ne grieved of hit /
As it appiereth by this fable of a rethoryque man or fair speker / which ones

having sum fault of kind on their bodies / as crouked or counterfayted /
he might have and take of them at thentre of the yate a penny / the which
demand the king granted to him / and made his lettres to be sealed and
wreton under his sygnet / And thus he kept him still at the yate / And of
every lame scabbed / and of all such that had any counterfaytour on their
bodies / he took a penny / It happed then on a day that a croukbacked and
counterfayted man would have entryd within the Cite without gyuynge of any penny
/ and bethought him self / that he should take and put on him a fair mantel /
and thus arrayed came to the yate / And then when the porter byheld him / he
perceived that he was goglyed / and said to him pay me of my dowte / And the
goglyed would pay naught / where fore he took from him his mantel / And then
he saw that he was crowkbacked and said to him / thou would not tofore pay
a penny / but now thou shall pay tweyne / And while that they stryued to gyder
/ the hat and the bonet folle from his head to the earth / And the porter
which saw his scabbed head / said to him / now shall thou pay to me three
pens / And then the porter yet again setted his hands on him / and felt /
that his body was al scabbed / And as they were thus wrastlynge to gyder / the
crowkbacked fylle to the ground / and hurted him self sore on the leg / And
the porter said then to him / Now shall thou pay v pens / For thy body is al
counter fayted / wherefore thou shall leave here thy mantell / And if thou
had paid a penny / thou had gone on thy way free and quyte / wherefore
he is wise that pays that / that he owes of right / to then de that thereof
come not to him gretter dommage /

the ship is little / wherefore late the marthaunt do pass over his sheep / And
after I shall make an end of my fable / And then was the king well appeased

THe cautele or falshede of the woman is wonder merueyllous / as it appiereth
by this fable / Of a merchant which was wedded of new unto a fair and young
woman / the which merchant went over the sea for to bye and selle / and for

this fair child / And she ansuerd / My Friend the holy ghoost of his grace has

appiereth by this fable / and as poge reherceth to us which says / that
sometime he fond him self in a good felauship / where he herd a fable / whi che
was there reherced / Of the which the tenor follows / and seyth the said
poge / that of all the goods of this world / the ypocrytes ben possessours /
For how be hit / that a^^ ypocryte ha ue sometime will for to help sum pour
and Indygent / Nevertheless he has a condycyon within him self / that is to w^^
/ that he should rather see a man at the point of death / than for to save his
life of an halfpeny / And this presumpcion is called ypocrysye / as ye shall here
herafter by the fable following the which says that one being in the
felauship of Poge reherced / that sometime the customme of all the pour was
that they went before the folks doors without saying any word It happed
then on that time that a pour man much fair and of good life went to
search his life fro one door to another / And upon a day emonge other he went
and set him self upon a great stone before the yate of a wydowe / which wy
dowe was acustommed to give him ever somewhat / And when the good woman knew
that he was at her door she did bring to him his portion as she was custommed
for to do / And as she gaf to him the mete she looked on him / and seeing him
so fair / and well made of body / she then filled of carnal concupiscence /
and brennynge in the fire of love / requered and Instantly prayed him that he
would return thither within three days / and promised to him that she should give
to him a right good dinner / And the pour man said to her / that he should do
so / And when he came again / he set him self as before / at door of
the wydowes hows / which the woman knew well when he should come / wherefore
she came to the yate and said / Come within good man / For now we shall dyne /
to the which prayer the pour man assented / and entered within the hows / the
which wydowe gaf to him good mete / and good drink / And when they had well
dyned / the said wydowe pressyd the good man strongly / and after she kys sed
him / requyrynge him that she might have the copye of his love / And then the
pour man al ashamed and Vergoynous knowing her thought and her will /
ansuerd thus to her / Certainly my good lady I dare not / but nevertheless he
would feign have done hit / And the wydowe al embraced with love beseched and
prayed him more and more / And then when the pour man saw that he might not
excuse him self / he said to the wydowe in this manner / My friend sith that
thou desyrest it for to do so much and so great an euylle / I take god to
my wytnes / that thou art causer of hit / For I am not consenting to the
faytte or deed / but saying these words he consented to her will

The third fable is of a young woman which accused her husband of coulpe or
blame

POge florentyne says / that sometime there was a man named Nerus de paas / the
which of his age was emonge the Florentyne / Right sage and prudent and right
rich / This Nerus had a fair daughter / the which he he married with a tyght
fair young man / and a rich / and of good parentage or kynred / the which
young man the next day after the feast of his wedding did led her in to his
castle / a lytyl way without the Cite of Florence / And within few days
after / this young man brought his wife again in to Florence unto the hows of
her fader Nerus / the which made then a feast as it was customed to do at
that time in some places eight days after the wedding / when this new
married or wed ded woman was come again to her faders hows / she maad not over
good chere / but ever she had her look dounward to the earth / as full tryste /
thoughtful and melancolyous / And when her mother perceived and saw her dough
ter so sorrowful / and of mourning contenaunce / she called her within a
wardroppe where as no body was / but they two / and asked of her the cause of
her sorrow / saying / how fare ye my daughter / what want you / have you not
all things coming to you after your desire and playsaunce / wherefore take ye
so great thought and melancolye / And then the daughter we pynge full tendyrly
said to the mother in this manner / Allas my mother ye have not married me to a man
/ For of such a thing that a man ought to have / he has never a dele / sauf
only a little part of that thing for the which wedding is made / And then
the mother right wroth and sorrowful of this evil fortune went toward her
husbond Nerus / and told to him theuyll adventure and hap of their daughter /
whereof he was gretely wroth and sore troubled / And soon after this fortune
was also dyuulged manyfested and known among all the lygnage of Nerus /
whereof they were al sorrowful / and gretely abashed / how this fair young man /
to whom god had sent so many good Virtues / and that had so many yeftes of
grace / as is beauty / Richesse / and good Renommee / and that he was Indygent
or fawtyf of that thing / wherefore marriage is made / Nevertheless the tables
were set and couerd /

And when the time of dinner came / the young man came in to the hows of Nerus
with his friends and parents / And Incontinent they set them all at the table
/ sum with heavy and sorrowful heart / and the other with great Joy and
pleasyr / And when the young man saw that all his Friends maad good chere /
and that all the parents of his wife were heavy and melancolyous / he prayed and
besoughte them / that they would tell him the cause of their heaviness and sorrow
/ but none of them all ansuerd / Nevertheless he prayed / and besought them yet
again / And then one of them full of sorrow and more lyberall than all the
other / said thus to him / Certainly my fair sone / thy wife has told to us /
that thou art not man parfyghte / For the which words the man began to
lawhe / and said with an high boys that al they that were there might
Understand what he said / My lords / and my friends make good chere / For the
cause of your sorrow shall soon be peased / And then he being clothed with
a short gown Vntyde his hosen / and took his membre with his han de / which
was great and much suffysaunt upon the table / so that all the folauship might
see hit / wherefore the said felauship might see hit / whereof the said felauship
was full glad and Ioyeful / whereof sum of the men desired to have as much /
And many of the wymmen wysshed to their husbands such an Instrument / And
then sum of the friends and parents of Nerus daughter went toward her /
and said to (...) / that she had great wrong for to complain her of her
husband / For he had well wherewith she might be contented / and blamed her
gretely of her folly / to whom the young daughter ansuerd / My friends why
blame ye me / I complain me not without cause / For our ass / which is a
brute be / has well a membre as great as mine arm / and my husband which
(...) a man / his membre is Uneath half so great / wherefore the simple and
young damoysell wend that the men should have hit as great and gretter than Asses

Therefore it is said often / that much lacks he of that that a fool thinks
or weneth

The fourth fable is of hunting and hawkynge
The fourth fable is of the hunting and hawkynge

POge Florentyn reherceth to us / how ones he was in a felauship where men spak

/ but none he put depper / than unto the stomach for doubt of gretter
Inconvenient / It happed then that emonge other was one brought to him /
which he put in to the said water unto the thyes / And when he had be by the
space of xv days within the said water / he began to be peasyble and gate
his wit again / And for to have take sum disporte and consolacion he prayed
to him which had the keeping of him / that he would take him out of the water
/ and promised to him that he should not depart fro the gardyn / And then the
kepar that kept him Unbound him fro the stake / and had him out of the water
/ And when he had be many days out of the pytte / he went well unto the
yate of the gardyn / but he durst not go out / less that he should be put

fool was al abashed / And in deed as by ^^as of nouelte / he called the said

said to him / that it was a horse which prouffi ted to him to the chase / and
bare him where he would / And af ter the fool demanded of him / And what is
that which thou wrest on thy fyste / and where to is it good / and the yongman
ansuerd to him / It is a sperehawst which is good for to take par^^ryches and
quaylles / And yet again the fool demaun ded of him / My friend what are thoos
that follow the / and where to ben they good / And the young man ansuerd to him
/ they be dogs which are good for to search and find partryches and
quaylles / And when they have raised them / my sperehawke takes them / whereof
proceeds to me great solas and playsyre / And the fool demanded again / To
your aduys the taking that ye do by them in a hole year / how much is hit /
shall hit bear to the great prouffyte / And the young man ansuerd to him four
or five crowns (...) there about / And no more said the fool / And to your
aduys how much shall they dispende in a year / And the young man ansuerd xl or
l crowns / And when the fool herd these words / he said to the said young
man / O my friend I pray the that soon thou wylt depart fro hens / For if our
fysicien come / he shall put the within the said pytte by cause that thou
art a fool / I was put in it Un to the thyes / but therein he should put the
unto the chynne / for thou do the grettest folly that ever I herd speak of /
And therefore the study of the hunting and hawkynge is a slouful cure / And
none ought to do hit without he be much rich and man of lyuelode / And yet
hit ought not to be done full often / but sometime for to take disporte and solas
/ and to dry ue awey melancolye

The V fable is of the recytacion of sum monstres

POge of Florence recyteth how in his time one named Hugh prince of the
medicines / saw a catte which had two hedes / and a calf which also had two
hedes And his legs both before and behind were double / as they had be
Joined al to gyder / as many folk saw / Item about the matches of ytalye
withynne a medowe was sometime a Cow / the which Cow maade and delyuerd her
of a Serpent of wonder and Right merueyllous grettenesse / Right hydous and
ferdful / For first he had the heed gretter than the head of a calf /
Secondly / he had a neck of the length of an Ass / And his ^^dy made after
the likeness of a dog / and his taylle was wonder great / thycke and long
without comparyson to any other

And when the Cow saw that she had maade such a birth / And that within
her belly she had borne so right horrible a beeste / she was al ferdful / and
lift her self up / and supposed to have fled aweye / but the Serpent with
his wonder long taylle enlaced her two hinder legs / and the Serpent then
began to souke the Cow / And in deed so much / and so long he souked
tylle that he fond sum milk / And when the Cow might escape fro him / she
fled unto the other kyne / And Incontinent her pappes and her behynder legs
and all that the Serpent touched was all black a great space of time / And
soon after the said Cow maade a fair calf / The which merueylle was
announced or said to the said (...) he being (...) Ferrare / And yet again
soon after that / there was fond within a great River a monstre maryn / or of
the sea of the form or likeness which follows /

First he had from the nauylle upward the symylytude or likeness of a man /
And fro the nauylle dounward / he had the form or making of a Fysshe / the
which part was i^^melle that is to wete double / Secondly he had a great
berd / and he had two wonder great hornys above his eres / Also he had
great pappes / and a wonder great and horrible mouth / and his hands retched
unto his entraylles or bowellys / And at the both his elbowes he had wings
right broad and great of fysshes mayles / wherewith he swymmed / and only he
had but the head out of the water /

It happed then as many wymmen bouked and wesshed at the port or haven of
the said River / that this horrible and ferdful beeste was / for lack and
defaulte of mete came swimming toward the said wymen / Of the which he took one
by the hand / and supposed to have draw her in to the water / but she was
strong / and well auysed and resysted ageynste the said monstre / And as she
deffended her self / she began to cry with a hy^^ wys / help help / to the
which came rennynge five wymmen / which by hurlynge and drawing of stones
kyld and slew the said monstre / For he was come to far within the sonde /
wherefore he might not return in to the deep water / And after when he
rendryd his spyryte / he made a right lytyl cry / saying that he was so
disformed and so much cruel / For he was of great corpulence more than any
man's body / And yet says ^^oge in this manner / that he bring at Ferrare he
saw the said monstre / And says yet / that the young children were customed
for to go bathe and wesshe them within the said River / but they came not all
again / wherefore the wymen wesshed ne bouked no more their clothes at the said
port / For the folk presumed and supposed that the monstre kyld the young
children / which were drowned / Item also within a lytyl while after hit
befelle about the marches of ytaly that a child of form humayne which had
two hedes and two Vysages or faces beholdynge one upon the other / and the
arms of each other embraced the body / the which body fro the nauyl upward
was Aoyned sauf the two hedes / and from the nauyll dounward the lymmes were al
separed one fro other in such wise that the lymmes of generation were showed
manyfestly / Of the which child the tidings came unto the person of the
(...) of Rome

The syxthe fable is of the parsone / of his dog / And of the Bishop /
Silver does and causes all thing to be done unto the halowynge again of a
place which is profane or Interdicte / As ye shall mow here by this
present Fable / Of a ^^reest dwelling in the country which sometime had a
dog / which he boued much / the which priest was much rich / The said
dog by process of time deyde / and when he was deed / he entered and buried
hit in the church yerd for cause of the great love which he loved him / it
hap^^ed then on a day his bishop knew hit by thaduertysement of sum other
/ wherefore he sen^^e for the said priest / and supposed to have of him a great
sum of gold / or else he should make him to be straytly punysshed / And then
he wrote a lettre unto the said priest / of which the tenor contained only
that he should come and speak with him / And when the pressed had read the
lettres / he Understood well all the caas / and pre supposed or bethought in
his courage / that he would have of him sum silver / For he knew well enough
the condycions of his bishop / and forthwith he took his breuyarye / and an C
crowns with him / and went for to speak to his prelate / and when he came
before him / the prelate began to remember and to she we to him the enormyte
of his mysdede / And to him answered the priest which was right wise saying in
this manner / O my right reverend fader / if ye knew the souernyne prudence
of which the said dog was filled / ye should not be merueylled if he has well
desernyd for to be buried honestly and worshipfully among the men / he was al
sylled thith humayn wit as well in his life / as in thartycle of the death /
And then the bishop said / how may that be / wherce to me then al his life
/ Certainly right reverend fader ye ought well to know / that when he was
at thartycle and at the point of death / he would make his testament / and the
dog knowing your great need and Indygence / he bequethed to you an C crowns
of gold / the which I bring now unto you / And then the Bishop for love of
the money he assoylled the pressed And also granted the said sepulture / And
therefore silver causes all thing to be granted or done

The Vij fable is of the Fox of the Cock and of the dogs

All the sallary or payment of them that mokken other is for to be mocaued at
the last / as hit appiereth by this present Fable / of a Cock which sometime
saw a fox coming toward him sore hongry and fainysshed / which Cock
supposed well that he came not toward him / but for to ete some hen / for
which cause the Cock maade al his hens to flee upon a tree / And when the
fox began tapproche to the said tree / he began to cry toward the cock good
tidings good tidings / And after he salewed the cost right reverently / and
demanded of him thus / O godsep / what do thou there so high / And thy
hens with the / have not thou herd the good tidings worthy and profitable
for us / And then the Cok full of malice ansuerd to him / Nay Verily godsep /
but I pray the / tell and reherce them unto us / Then said the fox to the
cost / Certainly godsep / they (...) the best that ever ye herd / For ye may
goo and come / talk and commnnpque among all leestes without any harm or
dommage / And they shall do to you both pleasyr and all seruyse to them
possible / for thus it is concluded and accorded / and also confermed by the
great counceyll of all bestes / And yet they have made commandment that none
be so hardy to Vex ne let in no wise any other / be it never so little a
be / For the which good tidings I pray the / that thou wylt come down /
to the end / that we may goo and sing / Te deum laudamus / for Joy / And the
Cok which knew well the fallaces or falshede of the fox ansuerd to him in
this manner / Certainly my brother and my good Friend thou have brought to me
right good tidings / whereof more than C times I shall thank the / And
saying these words the Cock lift up his neck / and his feet / and looked
far fro him / And the fox said to him / what godsep / where about lokest
thou / And the Cok ansuerd to him / Certainly my brother I see two dogs
strongly and lightly rennynge hytherward with open mouths / which as I
suppose come for to bring to us the tidings which thou have told to us / And
then the Fox which shoke for fere of the two dogs said to the Cock / god
be with you my friend / It is time that I depart fro hens / or these two dogs
come ^^rer / And saying these words took his way / and ran as fast as he
might / And then the cock demanded and cried after him / godsep / why
rennest thou thus / if the said pac^^ is accorded / thou ought not to doubt
no thing Ha a godsep said the Fox from far / I doubt / that these two
dogs have not herd the decre^^ of the pees / And thus when a begyler is
begyled / he received the sallary or payement / which he ought to have /
wherefore let every man keep him self there fro

POgius reherceth that there were two wymmen in Rome / which he knew of
diverse age and form / which came to a Curteyzan by cause to have and win
some what with their bodies / whom he received and happed that be knew the
fairest of both twyes / and that other ones / and so departed / And afterward
when they should depart / he gaf to them a pyece of lynen clothe / not
decernynge how much each of them should have to her part and portion / And in
the partynge of the said clothe fylle bitwene the wymmen a stryf by cause one
of them demanded two parts after thexygence of her work / And that other the
half after their persons / each of them showing dyuersly their resons / that
one saying that she had suffered him twyes to do his pleasyr / and that other
pretended / that she was ready and in her was no defawte And so fro words they
came to strokes and cratchyng with naylys / and drawing their here / in so
much that their neygh bours came to this battle for to depart them / And
also their own and propre husbondes / not knowing the cause of their stryf
and debate / each of them defending his wives cause / And fro the fighting of
the wymmen hit aroos and came to their husbondes with buffettis and casting of
stones / so long that men ran between them / And after the customme of Rome
both the husbondes were brought to prison berynge enemyte each to other / and
know no thing the cause wherefore / The said cloth is set in the hands of
the wymen secretly yet not departed / but is secretly argued among the
wymmen in what wise that this matter shall be divided / And I demand of
doctors what the law is of it

He says also that a Merchant of Florence bonght an horse of a man / and made
his covenant with the sellar for xxv du cattes for to pay forthwith in hand
xv ducattes / And as for the rest he should abide dettour and owe / And the
sellar was content / and thereupon delyuerd the horse and received the xv
ducattes / After this a certain term the sellar demanded of the byar the
resydue / And he denied the payment / and had him hold his covenant / For the
byer said we were accorded that I should be thy debtour / And if I should
satysfye and pay the I should no more be thy dettour / et (...) / and so he
abode dettour

HE tells also that there was a carryk of Iene hired in to france for to make
war against englissmen / of the which ^^arrik the patron bare in his sheld
painted an ox head / which a noble man of france beheld and saw / and said
he would avenge him on him that bare tho arms / whereupon aroos an altercacion
so much / that the frensshman provoked the Ia^^eye to bataylle and fight
therefore / The Ianuey acceptyd the prouocacion / and came at the day assigned
in to the field without any array or habyllements of war / And that other
frensshe man came in much noble apparayll in to the feld that was ordained /
and then the patron of the carrik said where fore i^^ it that we two should
this day fight and make bataill fore I say said that other that thyn arms ben
mine / and bylonged to me to fore that thou had them / Then the Ianuey
said It is no need to make any bataylle therefore / For the arms that I bear is
not the head of an ox but it is the head of a cow which thing so spoken the
noble Frensshe man was abashed and so departed half mocqued

ALso he says that there was a phisycyen dwelling in a Cite / which was a
great and a connyng man in that sey en^^ / and he had a servant a young man
which made pyl les after a certain form that he showed to him / and when
this young man had dwellid long with him / and could parftly make the pyllys /
he departed fro his master / and went in to strau^ ge country where as he was
known / and let men there to Un derstonde that he was a conning phisycyen /
and could give medycynes for all manner maladyes and sekenesses / and mynystred
alwey his pylles to every man that came to him for any remedy / And hit was so
that a pour man of that place where he was came to him / and complained how he
had lost his ass / and prayed him to give to him a medycyne for to find his
ass again / And he gaf to him the said pyllys / and ^^dde him to receive and
take them / And he should find is ass / And this pour man did so / and after
went in to the feldes and pastures to seek and look after his ass / and so
doing the pyllys wronght so in his belly / that he must needs go purge him /
and went among the reed and there easyd him / And anon there he fond his
ass / whereof he being much Ioyeful ran in to the town / and told and
proclaimed / that by the medecyn that he had received of the phisycyen he had
found his ass / which thing known all the simple people reputed him for a
much conning man / which could no thing do but make pyllys / And thus many
fools are often taken for wise and conning / Fo^^ he was reputed to hele all
manner sekenesses / and also to find asses

THere was in a certain town a wydower wowed a wydowe for to have and wedde
her to his wife / and at the last they were agreed and sured to gyder / And when
a young woman being servant with the wydowe herd thereof / she came to her
maystresse / and said to her / Allas maystresse what have ye do / why said she
/ I have herd say said the maid / that ye be assured and shall wedde such a
man / And what then said the wydowe / Allas said the maid I am sorry foryow /
by cause I have herd say that he is a peryllous man / For he lay so often and
knew so much his other wife that she deyde thereof / And I am sorry thereof / that
if ye should fall in like caas / to whom the wydowe answered and said /
Forsothe I would be deed / For there is but sorrow and care in this world / This
was a curteys excuse of a wydowe

NOw then I will fynysshe all these fables with this tale that follows
which a worsipful priest and a parsone told me late / he said / that there
were duellynge in Oxenford two prestes both maystres of art / of who me that
one was quyck and could put him self forth / And that other was a good simple
priest / And so it happed that the master that was perte and quyck was anon
promoted to a benefyce or tweyne / and after to prebendys / and for to be a
Dene of a great princes chapel / supposing and wenynge that his felaw the
simple priest should never have be promoted but be alwey an Annuel / or at the
most a parysshe priest / So after long time that this worshipful man this dene
came riding in to a good paryssh with a x or xij horses / like a prelate / and
came in to the church of the said parysshe / and fond

there this good simple man sometime his felawe / which ca^^ and welcomed him
lowely / And that other badde him good morrow master Johan / and took him
sleyghtly by the hand and axyd him where he dwelled / And the good man said /
in this paryssh / how said he / are ye here a soul priest or a paryssh priest
/ nay sir said he / for lack of a better though I be not able ne worthy I am
parson and curate of this parysshe / and then that other aualed his bonet and
said master parson I pray you to be not displeased / I had supposed ye had
not ^^e been fyeed / But master said he / I pray you what is this benefyce
worth to you a year / Forsothe said the good simple man / I wot never / for I
make never accomptes thereof / how well I have had hit four or five year / And
know ye not sa id he what it is worth / it should seem a good benefyce / No
forsothe said he / but I wot well what it shall be worth to me / why said he /
what shall hit be worth / Forsothe said he / if I do my true dylyge^ce in
the cure of my parysshe^s in prechyng and techynge / and do my part longing
to my cure / I shall have heaven therefore / And if their sowles ben lost or
any of them by my defawte / I shall be punysshed therefore / And hereof am I sure
/ And with that word the rich dene was abussded And thought he should be the
better / and take more head to his ^^res and benefyces than he had done / This
was a good answer of a good priest and an honest /

And here with I fynysshe this book / translated and emprynted by me William
