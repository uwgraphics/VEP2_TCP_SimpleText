An historical and true discourse of a voyage made by the Admiral Cornelis
Matelief the younger, into the East Indies, who departed out of Holland in May,
Anno. 1605.
IN regard that we began our voyage somewhat too late in the year, it fell
out to be so much the longer, (as I wrote unto your worships in January last,
from the Island Mauritio, by the Admiral Steven vander Haghen:) from whence we
departed the 27. of January, and fearing the passage of those shallow places,
we caused our Pinnasses or small boats to sail before, and in the night time
to hang out Lanthornes, by which means we got over the flats of Nazare, over
the North point called Haya de Malsa, and Perodes Banhos, and made toward
Chagros, but could not get thither by the North, and therefore took our course
Southerly, and found no ground: from thence we past between Pulo Malueo, and
the Maldiues, but saw no land until the two and twenty of March, yet we
espied the Island of Sumatra, which is the point of Achin, but could not reach
it.

The 28. of January we drew near to the Nicobares, where we took in fresh
water, and got some Coques Nuttes, and a few Hens, in which place the
inhabitants go altogether naked: there I thought to have gotten some Amber,
which if I had stayed there, I might have got for five blankes. There our men
went on shore, and having mustered, prepared some instruments of wood which I
as then wanted.

At which time our soldiers and Sailers, desiring to know to what parts they
were bound (for that as then they began to murmr amongst themselves, saying,
that they were not hired to fight on land (and some of the chiefest Sailers
stoutly maintained it.) I showed them that the states commissaries Commission
given unto me, was to besiege and win the town of Malacca, setting before
their eyes what honor and great profit they were to expect from thence,
together with the small peril which they had to incur: saying, that I would
send them to no other place, but where I would hazard mine own life with them,
promising them that if they chanced to win the town by force of assault,
they should have the ransacking thereof, and if that they got it by treaty and
composition, they should likewise have that they found therein, reserving some
part thereof to fortify the town withal, wherewith they were much
encouraged, and resolutely with one voice, cried out and said, that they were
fully resolved to win the town, and with that resolution we sailed through
the Straights: and upon the last of April, arrived within half a mile of
Malacca, with the loss of two men only, that dyed by the way.

And being come before Malacca, I commanded that four ships that lay in the
road, (whereof one was laden for China,) should be set on fire, but my
commission being not observed, my men giving themselves to drinking, they let
them make away, where they had three men slain, and fifteen wounded: but I
willed them only to burn them, and not to ransake them.

The next day after we consulted about our landing (for that order had been
taken long before how we should land, and what every man should do) some were
of opinion to land presently, others said that it was not expedient for us to
land so hastily in a strange country, not knowing the enemies forces, and that
it was best for us to stay the coming of the King of Ihor that was looked for
within eight or ten days, for we perceived a wood near unto the shore, much
to the enemies advantage to play upon us from thence, we not being able to
pursue them, and therefore alleged that they thought it not good to put the
whole Fleet in danger, before the coming of the King of Ihor: who being
arrived with two or three thousand men, they said we might land boldly, and
put our enemy in great fear: this was the judgment of the greater part of us,
which did prevail, though I my self liked better of our present landing.

The eight of May we landed with the King of Ihor, (who had about three
thousand men with him,) and in our landing lost not one man; for the Portugales
being two or three hundred, that stood ready on the shore to resist us,
suddenly retired into the suburbs of the town, where they defended themselves
till mid night, and then setting them on fire, and breaking the bridge, ran
into the town. In my advise sent unto the Commissaries, I have declared what I
have done before Malacca, until the eight of August, and what small aid and
assistance we have received from the Ihorites, with the disorder and mutiny of
our people, the strength of the town, their sallies out against us, and how
they have with credit been driven back again by us, etc.

At such time as we intended to remove our siege, in regard that the
Portingales Armado as then lay hard by Capo Rachado, which is about twelve
miles from Malacca: they of Malacca thought verily either to spoil us, or to
hinder our pretense (they of Malleyc being all gone aboorde, except a hundred
and twenty, or a hunderd and thirty men,) and issuing out of the town with all
the men they could make, set upon us, but we courageously drove them back
again, with the loss of fifty of their men, and but one man of ours hurt.

This done, for the space of two nights I was much troubled about shipping of
our Ordnance, in regard that the stream was not swift, whereby the water
could not get to the shore, and the ground very muddy, so that I could hardly
get our Canon aboard, but God provided so well for us, that upon the 16. day we
all got aboard, and left not any thing on the shore, having about three
hundred hurt and sick men amongst us. Notwithstanding the 17. of August we set
forward to encounter our enemy, whose Fleet was 14. Galions, 4. Galleys, and
15. or 16. Fustes or Frigates, and two or three Galions, came two or three
days after unto their Fleet: that evening we shot against them, and chased
them, but in the night they put on more sails, and we following after them
all the next day, holding our course Northerly. The next night following I laid
me down to sleep, for I had taken no rest in three days and three nights
before, being much busied about our Ordinance: In the mean time Dyrick Mol
master of my ship came unto me, showing me that the enemy out-sailed us,
asking me whether we should put on any more sails, I answered, yea; and
willed him at any hand to keep them still in fight. Not long after that he
came again, and told me that the enemy had cast Anchor, whereupon I charged
him to Anchor also, and to keep above the wind: The rest of our ships anchred
loofeward, a Canon shot wide from the enemy. In the morning before the break
of day, I caused a piece to be shot off, to warn to set sail, for as then
the enemy had gotten somewhat more, and had the loofe of us: and at the same
time also shot off a warning piece unto his ship. Our ship called the
Nassau, was long winding up of her Anchor; and before I could make signs unto
her to cut the cable, a Portugal ship aborded her, which I perceiving, wound
my ship about to aid her, but the Sea was so calm, that I could not reach
her, but by force borded Simon Man, and could by no means get from him. The
Admiral Alioza de Caruailla, seeing us fast together, boorded Simon Mau, and
Henrico de Loroinge boorded me, (these two were the greatest Gallions the
enemy had): after that came Duarte de Guerra, and fell also upon me,
wherewith we gave fire on all sides, at which encounter most part of Duarte
de Guerras men were killed, and he himself also: Alioza de Caruailla forsook
his ship, and was likewise slain: Don Henrico received more then a hundred
shottes thorough his ship.

Afterward Claes Gherritsz Master of the Mauritius, fell upon Duarte de
Guerra, and set her on fire, whereby our blind also was set on fire: the other
Portugal ships would have set upon us, but durst not for the fire, mean time
I cast out an Anchor which was cut off by my men, but they said that it was
done by the fire. The Mauritius loosed himself, and Simon Man of Middleborough
drove from us, with Duarte de Guerra, and Alioza de Caruailla, but the people
for the most part were all slain, I having cast out another Anchor, called
unto them to cast one of their Cables unto us to stay them, but the noise was
so great that they heard us not, so that they burnt all together. Simon Mau
saved the most part of his men, except eighteen that were hurt, and some that
were taken prisoners, that were afterward released by my means. I was still
fast grapled to Henrico, to whom I promisd his life if he would yield, (for
he could not defend himself, which he promised to do, many of his men being
very desirous to come over into our ship, but I refused them (yet twelve of
them came aboard) fearing that my men would fall to the spoil, for they had
twice more men then we, and our anchor would not hold, and still the enemies
fleet approached, we being very weary, my Master and my Captain being
slain, and the chief Merchant hurt, whereof not long after he dyed, and I
was forced to be present at every conflict. Whereupon I commanded Don Henrico
to cast out anchor, but he excused himself, saying, that he was not able to
do it, for which cause I sent a man to look whether it were so or not, which
gave himself to the spoil; then I sent an other that took the masters
Whistle from his neck, but coming back again, said that the ship was full
of dead men, and that the anchors were lost, and the cables shot in pieces,
by the Canon shot. Whereupon I caused a Rope to be brought out at the
Stern, to fasten it unto us. In the mean time our anchor took hold, and his
ship brake from us, and so I lost my prize: which shows that they which make
many delays, are often disappointed, so that it seems that marshall affairs
must be undertaken with quick and speedy resolution. This grieved us much, but
there was no remedy: This happened about evening.

One of the enemies ships also boorded the Nassau, at which time also their
Viceroy fell upon him on the other side, but could not win him, and
therefore set the Gallery, and the Stern of her on fire, and so she was
burnt, the Viceroy likewise had been burnt with her if the Galleyes had not
plucked him away by force.

The most part of the Nassaus men were saved: Mauritius and the Black Lion
thought to have fallen upon the Viceroy; but the wind was too calm, the rest
of our ships did their endeavors, but there were some faint-hearted amongst
them, notwithstanding we held out, and fought all that day, although
unfortunately with loss of two ships on either side.

The next day being the nineteen of August, all our ships being repaired, we
resolved to recover our losses, for the which we were much grieved, but if the
Nassau had cut her Anchors in time, we had not boorded one the other, and it
had fallen out better for us.

The twentieth of August we fell to it again, although I found not my men so
ready and resolute as before, for those that had escaped out of the ships
that were burnt, especially they of Middleborough, asked me where they should
have their months pay, whereunto I answered, that it was then no time to
speak of such matters; and that I knew not how the Commissaries would
understand these things, and yet I said I was informed that they had behaved
themselves valiantly, and that therefore it was no reason but that they should
have their due, and that to my power I would defend and maintain them in all
just causes. Within an hour after, the men of my ship also came unto me, and
demanded security for their months pay; or else they said they would not
fight: they had some setters on, which as yet I dare not name. This made me
half abasht, yet I used all the means that I could possible to appease them,
and at the last they seemed to be contented.

About the evening we approached the enemy again, and then I first observed
what danger the words (of respective ships) set down in our Articles brought
us into: for by means of the loss of the two ships aforesaid, every one
drew back from joining with the enemy, being loathe to use his hypoteke or
assurance, whereby we were not half so forward to set upon our enemy as we
were at the first; for not so much as a Swabber in the ship but he would
dispute upon the words of Respective ships, for whereas it is said, that for
the assurance of their pay, they shall have the ship wherein they served, and
the goods that were in it and no more, every one was careful for his own.

That day and the next we shot diverse times at the Viceroy, but I perceiving
that we had not powder enough to overcome such an army, nor bullets to serve
our turns, though I had caused some to be made before Malacca; but not
sufficient, we left off.

The ships that stayde behind came near unto the enemy, that had his rowing
Pinnasses, wherewith he could fetch water when he would, and in our sight
carried his hurt men to Malacca, whereupon we called a counsel together, and
resolved to go to Ihor, chiefly to release our ships, for it seemed that our
enemy could sail better then we, as also to refresh out sick men, to make
Bullets, and to encourage the King: this we performed at Ihor, which has one
of the best rivers of the world: there we made Bullets, but could get but
little refreshing for money, I also encouraged the King of Ihor, counselling
him to fortify his town, and showed him how he should do it, which at last
was begun, and had soon been finished, if the Hollanders would have wrought.

We departed thence the thirteen of October, and the twentieth came before
Malacca, and for the space of six days lay in sight of the Town, but could
not approach near unto it by reason of the wind, so that the enemy placed all
his ships, being seven Galeons and three Galleys (for the fourth was shot
to pieces by Capo Rachado) in a row, and all his Canon on the one side. We
there-vpon taking counsel resolved to set upon the enemy, but because we had
little provision of powder, and a long journey to make home-ward, and
perceiving that we could not separate their ships with shooting, we agreed
that three of our ships should board them, which I thought to have done in the
night time, taking with me the Sun, and the Froninee of Delse, but could not
by reason of the stream: the morning being cool and clear, and fit to
take something in hand, the wind coming from the land, and we lying
Northerly from the road, we made sail, meaning to fall upon their ship
that lay most Southerly and most beneath the stream, for the water began to
turn, but the wind was so sharp, that I could scant pass by the road, so
that we approached near to Illa das noas, and woond about it, but could not
set upon any of them, but upon that which lay Northerliest (which was the
greatest Gallion next unto the Vice-royes, and had in her nineteen Brass
pieces, and three Iron pieces, a hundred and three score Portingales, and as
many Moors (I willed my master called Simon Lambrechtsz Man, whom I had taken
into my ship, in the steed of Dirick Mol that was slain, to set upon her. We
were forced to pass by all the ships of the enemy, not without some hurt
unto us, but I shot not at all, rescuing every thing ready until our
aboording, but when we were half way forward amongst the enemies ships, my
Master and the Pylote counseled me to turn our course, to who^ I made
answer, that I wanted no advise nor counsel, to delay them of till we were
aboard the Gallion, and so held on until we boorded her, and so let a Dragge
fall, appointing ten Musquetters to keep it, and to hinder that the enemy
should not loose it, which the enemy sought to do: I willed them also to
shoot continually toward their Mersch, and from our Mersch and garnates, I
caused stones and fire-balles to be cast, whereby the enemy was driven under
his net. And as soon as I had fastened upon him, the Sun fell on his other
side, and the Province came behind us, and brake his Spritt against the
enemies ships, the Galion had an anchor before the flood, and a cable fastened
at the Vice-royes ship, but the cable was presently cut in pieces, as also
the cable that fastened the Viceroy unto him, and so we drove together toward
the Lee: the other Portugales perceiving that, hoysed their sails (which was
that which I aimed at, to draw them from the wall,) and made to sea-ward. We
fell upon the Saint Nicholas, and killed all the men, except eight
Portingalles, that hid themselves under the Ballast, and so we took her.

My Master and the Pilote said, that it was not expedient that two of our
ships should be bound to one ship, and that we should leave the Sun
alone with it, and fall upon the Viceroy that drew near unto us, which
counsel I liked not, fearing to have the like chance that I had with Henrico.

A little while after Roobol Master of the great Sun, called unto me, to
pray me to let him alone in the ship, and that he would carry it to the
Sea, which I would not consent unto, but perceiving that I could not do any
thing to my mind, I leaft it: and presently the weather was very calm, the
Portingales ships lay loofe-ward from us, whereof one made toward the great
Sun, but he could not, fearing to be clapped on board by us, we perceiving
that the calm either hindered us to come together; I sent a boat to Roobol
willing him to set fire in the ship, where unto he answered that I should
hold my peace, and said he would not do it, in the mean time he got
himself loose, by what means I know not, and hoysing up his great sail,
ran more then a mile from the Fleet not once looking back: In the mean
while two Portingale ships boorded the Vize-admirall, against whom came
Mauritius and the Black Lion, and behaved themselves so well, that the one of
the enemies ships was burnt, and the other spoiled. The Erasmus set upon a
portingale, but they were presently separated again, and I sailing by him
willed him to board him again, which he did, but they were presently separated
again. The great calm hindered me that I could not come near them: after
that a whirlewinde rising, scattered the ships; and with that Mauritius made
toward the Portingale again, Erasmus and I also turning toward him, which
the Portingale perceiving, yielded unto us, where we killed four and forty
Portingales, and took out of her eight pieces of brass, and so set fire on
her. In the ship which the Vize-admirall burnt there was not so much as a
catte or a dog saved: The ship that Roobol did let go, was driven by the
Galleys to the shore, and so the evening came upon us.

The next morning, the Vizeroys ship lying foremost, I made toward him, but
my Master and Pilot told me that I could not reach him; for which cause I
made to the Galion Saint Simon, that yielded it self unto me, for the men
were most of them run from him: the Captain with twenty men only remaining
in her: out of her I took fourteen pieces, some flesh, wine, and powder, and
so set it on fire.

This (thanks be unto GOD) was the success of our battle, without any
great loss of men, we burnt three Gallions, wherein many Gentlemen were
slain, and above four hundred Portingale soldiers, as I was after informed
by certain intercepted letters; we our selves made our victory bloody, for
our men were so diuilishly given so seek after prey and booty, that rowing
round about the Gallion that burnt, they fell to ransacking the men that swum
in the water, whereby the fire got into the powder, and burnt three of our
boats, wherein we lost four and twenty men of the White Lion, eighteen of
the Black Lion, eleven of the Vice Admiral, seven of the Province, and five
of the great Sun. God forgive them their ouer-sight.

The eight and twenty day we went again toward Malacca; intending to burn
the Viceroy and the Paul, but as we had concluded the evening before to
perform it: the next morning the Viceroy himself caused fire to be put into
three of the Gallions, so great was their fear: I seeing that presently
retired, thinking them to be fire ships sent for to burn us.

After that I made agreement to release the Portingales, that were in all a
hundred seauenty five, and as many Moors, upon condition that the Viceroy
should send me all my Duch-men that were prisoners in Mallacca, and that he
had in any place within the Indies; and that three Captains, Christianus
Swarez, Andreas Peso, and Ferdinando Marcado, should pay five thousand Ducats
for their ransom, which should be divided amongst our men.

Which accordingly was performed, beside a thousand Ducats which are not yet
paid, for two Portingales, whereof one left his brother with me in hostage:
This money I divided amongst the Sailors, every one having five ryals of eight,
(for the Ducats make but six ryals) to make them the willinger to set upon
the rest of the Armado that was gone to Nisobaer. The chief thing worthy the
noting was that when I came the second time within the sight of Mallacca, there
rose a mutiny in some of the ships saying that they would not fight, and
alleging that they entered not into service to that end, saying that it was
true that they had made me a promise to make a trial upon Nisobaer but that
they said was performed before Mallacca: and also at Capo Rachado, as they
supposed: the most part of them yielded to reason, but those of the
Vice Admiral said they would give ear to nothing, so that I was forced to use
some threatening words, and said that for all their denial the matter should
not go as they would have it, and so willing, nilling, they went on with the
rest.

Thus I went with all the ships to Nisobaer, though I intended to have sent
the White-Lyon and the Vice Admiral toward; Bantham, there to take in their
lading, and the next year to be at home: but the most voices would have us
all to go together to Nisobaer, and to try whether we could seperat their
ships, which we hoped to find all dispersed, as also to get the King of
Queda on our side, to the end that no victuals should be carried from thence
to Malacca, and so we came before Queda.

The nineteen of November I offered my service unto the King, showing him that
I was come thither to help him for to drive the Portingales out of his
dominions, and to chase them from his Haven, according to his letters written
unto me, and sent to Batasaner, and that I was desirous to lade a ship
there, because his name was not yet known in our country, which I said would
tend unto his honor and profit. The King glad to hear that, prayed me to
help him to take a Pourtugale ship and two Fregattes that lay in the river:
Whereupon I presently sent three Boats that the same night set those three
ships on fire, after that the Maleyes had taken the goods unwares out of
them, for I charged my men to take nothing from thence, there I took a praw
coming from Malacca, and therein some letters, containing that their Armado
was not far from Paulo Bouton, and meant to sail to the Indies the fourth of
December: therefore I made have to follow them, before that the four Fregattes
with a hundred and four and twenty men and munition of war, should come
unto them, and join with them.

The ninth of December we got to Paulo Bouton, and saw the Armado, which no
sooner perceived us, but they retired to a place where they had stream and
wind to their advantage, and made themselves fast with four cables before and
behind, and with a cable that reached from the one ship to the other, and
lay in such manner that we could not come near unto them, unless we would
wind our selves on board of them in the night, I sent diverse ships unto
them, but could do nothing. Then we prepared a fire ship, thinking under the
shot of our Cannon to get near them, but it would not be: they had placed
all their Canon on the one side, and in the midst all along their ships they
had laid Trees and Pipes filde up with sand, and had in-sconsed themselves in
such manner, that they could turn and wind their ships as they would, and
discharge their Cannon at their pleasures, having a Northerlie wind that blew
strongly out of the valleys, so that we sought to get near unto them.

When we came toward the point of the land, it was there calm under the high
land, and coming near unto them, the wind blew out of the Valleys, so that
if we would board them, we could not, unless we would burn our selves with
them, which they desire, (as it appears by the letters of the Viceroy) for
they make their reckoning that they have wone victory enough if by burning of
two of their ships, they burn one of ours: for the King cares not for his
ships, so he may thereby find the means to hinder the Hollanders from their
Navigations.

It was not good for us to stay there any longer, for every day we lost our
anchors, so that our resolution was to go to Pulo Lankeui, where they must of
force stay, if they would go for Mallacca, that so we might set upon them in
the maine Sea. The twentieth day lying under Lankeui, six miles from Poulo
Bouton, we determined to send the white Lion to Queda to see if she might get
three or four hundred bales of Pepper there, because at Dachin she should
find lading enough to serve her turn: But they could get nothing in Queda:
For when they begin to gather the new Pepper, the old is gone, which is worth
four and twenty ryalls in Cosgie, and in Ihor, and so went to the rest of our
ships again, lying under Pulo Lankeui to watch for the Portingales.

The nine and twentieth day the King of Queda (after that I burnt the Portugales
ships in his River) caused twenty Portugales to be killed, thinking so to do
me a great pleasure therein, because I had sent him word that he should show
some signs by his actions, that I might conceive him to be my good friend.
Your Worshippes may judge hereby what affection he bears unto the
Portugales: From thence there is nothing to be brought away but Pepper and
victuals, whereby those of Mallacca are sustained: this people always hold
with the stronger part. In the delivering of the Portingale prisoners unto the
Vice roy before Mallacca, I had like to have been betrayed, for whereas I was
so liberal that I gave a hundred and seauenty Portingales, and as many Moors,
for five or six of my men which they had (but I reserved the Captains and
three or four more for to get the three thousand ducats aforesaid) I sent a
note by a Portingale on shore, to will the Viceroy to send me my men, and I
would send him all his soldiers hole and disseased, which if he refused and
held me in suspense, I said I would cast all the Portingales ouerboord, he
returned with a note, whereby the Viceroy willed me to send him the
Portingales, and sent me a bill of all their names both soldiers and Captains
and all others that were in my hands, and when my messe^ger showed me that the
prisoners were in danger of their lives; Andrew Hurtado made answer let him
kill them, the rest will fight better an other time, which when I understood, I
returned the messenger presently again with this answer that if in the morning
before Sun rising he did not send me all my Duch men I would kill all the
Portingales; for I perceived that the Viceroy delaid me off; he returning
brought with him three Duch-men, for there were no more in the town, the rest
were in the Armado at Poulo Bouton: which he promised to send, mean time I
had called a Council together, and my white flagge hung out, and certainly if
he had staid but two hours longer, these hundred and seauenty Portingales had
been cast ouer-boord, for a warning unto them, not to mock with us another
time, for when they have their desires, they scoff at us, and esteem us to
be men that know not the course of the world, and that dare not (because of
the reverence we bear unto them) offend them any-way, and thus the boast
before the Indian Princes.

I thought to have sent a letter to the Viceroy, but deferred it for certain
causes, until some fitter time, to let him understand that we intended to
make warre-like soldiers, and that if he would deal hardlyer with my men that
he should take, then I had hither to done with his, he would find himself
greatly deceived, and that if he thought to stop my mouth with the
Inquisition and such like masquerados, and so keep and consume my men in his
country, saying that he could do nothing against th'Inquisition, I and those
that shall come after me to the Indies, would make war against
th'Inquisition, and cast all their shaueling Friars ouer-boord, which would
concern the Inquisition and not him. May it therefore please the States to
take such order that these fellows may no longer terrify us with their
vizards: And thus much I caused to be said unto the Viceroy himself by the
Captains that were prisoners.

Mean time I sent a Praw from Queda to Pulo Lankeui with one of my men in it,
to see whether the enemy lay still at Poulo-bouton, who returned answer the
nine and twentieth day, that they were yet there, and brought two boys
prisoners with him, that told me that they had sent a Galliot to Mallacca to
have advise from the Viceroy, to know what they should do, whither they should
return to the Indies or to Mallacca, for they durst not leave their advantage,
without command: they said also, that when I thought to have set on them with
the fire-shippe and shot upon them, that twenty men were killed in the
Admiral, seven in John Pintos ship, and eight in Iacomo de Mararis his
cousins ship wherein they went, but what was done in the other ships they
knew not.

I perceiving that there was no lading at Queda, and that the enemy would not
leave his place of advantage, and that my time drew near to go to the
Molucques, durst not stay any longer, for Amboine was of force to be fortified,
whilst Ternate was taken in by those of Manilles, where the Governor Don Pedro
de Sousa with a thousand two hundred Spaniards and eight hundred Indians was
come, and had taken the King prisoner.

Therefore we concluded, that the Vice Admiral with the White Lion, and the
great Sun, should go for Achin, to see if they by any means could make the
like agreement with the King, as we had made with the King of Ihor, and to
give the White Lion her full lading, and so send her homeward, as also for to
take in his own lading if he might, if not to go presently for Bantam, and
there to take in their lading, and so to return home-ward, if he could be
ready against the last of February, or the middle of March at the furthest, and
to send the great Sun to the coasts of Cormandel, but first to sail by
Puncto de Galli under Celon, and there to traffic and stay until the last of
February, looking for the ships of Bengale, and other places, which at that
very time came from Couchien, and then were to go toward Masolipatan, hoping
that they shall find traffic enough for Pauwels van Sold, being in the
Ship called Delfte, has (as I understood of the Portugales that were taken
before Queda) gotten three hundred bales of Cotton, linen painted, and also
some Pintados.

I intended to go the inner way to Bantam with six Ships, to see if I can
make agreement also with the King, and from thence to take our voyage toward
Amboyna and the Molucques, for Amboyna must necessarily be fortified, and we
must try once again to get the Molucques. Those of Banda play the beasts:
some resolution or other must be taken, for our men with their goods, that are
there not assured of their lives, and the goods of the company are much
endangered. From thence we will make toward China, and try what we can do
there.

In the boat which I took before Malacca upon the three and twentieth of
October, I had seven and thirty bales, most part linen cloth, and some
Spanish Lether, whereof seven I sent by the same boat to Amboyna, with four
thousand ryals, four and forty men, and forty Negros, and the half part of
his lading of Rice, that was spoiled: and to go to Maraza to buy good Rise,
Flesh, and some Pintados or Cotton, Painted cloth, for to carry to Amboina,
and to tell them that I would follow after them in the end of December: The
other seventeen Bales I gave to our Sailors for a prize, with a Bale of thread,
to make them the more willinger and readier to fight, for that they had gotten
but little booty. I hope we shall find lading at Amboina and Banda, for the
Pintados or Cotton cloth of Panwels van Sold, shall no doubt have prepared
something for us.

I perceive full well that we shall have long work to do about the
Molucques, and that the time will fall out too short for us to go to Mouson in
China; but time will teach us what is to be done: if we assure not Amboina,
all our labor is in vain, it is also against my opinion that the Spaniard
should come thither.

The General Don Pedro de Sousa is made Marquis of Ternate: The King that is
taken is carried to the West Indies, but his son is leaft with the King of
Sidor, I was in good hope to have performed something, but my army is too
much weakened, and I find what hurt I received from the ship that was burning
before Malacca, for there I lost the best men in my ships: it is a strange
thing that they are so rashlye and rudely given to the spoil, yet
notwithstanding I must be content and hold my peace.

Your worships may hereby perceive, how we have behaved our selves these nine
months here in the Straights, some-time fortunately, and sometime crossely,
but always have done the best we could, following your worships council. I
never wanted will nor courage to do any service for my country, and though I
have not done as I would or desired, yet I have performed what I could, as it
is manifest by the premises. I comfort my self with this saying: That it is
enough in great matters to will well, the Tree falls not at the first blow: if
I could have ouer-throwne those seven ships that lay still at Paulo Bouton,
our time had been well spent, but we thought it not expedient to spendall our
powder and munition. We have yet a long journey to make, we must not be too
prodigal: I have written my whole mind to the general company, what means
there are to begin war again.

The Almighty GOD give us a prosperous voyage, that all our endeavors may tend
to the good of our native country, and of the worshipful company.

The 6. of January 1607.
