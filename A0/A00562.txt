VERO NIHIL VERIVS



To the right Honorable my very good Lord and Master, EDWARD DEVERE Earl of
Oxenford, Vicount Bulbeck, Lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord great
Chamberlain of England, JOHN FARMER wishes long life, health and happiness
with increase of honor.
MOst Honorable Lord, it comes not within the compass of my power to
express all the duty I owe, nor to pay the least part: so far have your
Honorable favors outstripped all means to manifest my humble affection, that
there is nothing left but praying and wondering. There is a canker worm that
breeds in many minds, feeding only upon forgetfulness, and bringing forth
no birth but ingratitude: to show that I have not been bitten with that
monster, for worms prove monsters in this age, which yet never any Painter
could counterfeit to express the vglines, nor any Poet describe to decipher
the highth of their ilnes: I have presumed to tender these Madrigales only as
remembrances of my service and witnesses of your Lordships liberal hand, by
which I have so long lived, and from your Honorable mind that so much have
loved all liberal Sciences: in this I shall be most encouraged, if your
Lordship vouchsafe the protection of my first fruits, for that both for your
greatness you best can, and for your judgment in Music best may: for without
flattrie be it spoken, those that know your Lordship know this, that using this
science as a recreation, your Lordship have ouergone most of them that make it
a profession. Right Honorable Lord, I hope it shall not be distasteful to
number you here amongst the favorers of Music, and the practisers, no more
then Kings and Emperors that have been desirous to be in the roll of
Astronomers, that being but a star fair, the other an Angels Quire. Thus
most humbly submitting my self, my labors, and what ever is or may be in me,
to your Lordships censure and protection: I humbly end wishing your Lordship as
continual an increasing of health and honor, as there is a daily increase of
virtue, to come to happiness.

Your Honors most dutiful servant to command JOHN FARMER.

To the Reader.
THe present age being so bewtified with excellent Poets and adorned with rare
Musitions, amongst whom some by public writings make an eliphant of a mouse:
other by strange Paradoxes strive to attain pre-eminence: I have thought good
amongst the rest, being as virtuously ambitious as any, to expose my self to
the world, clothing my infant in humility, not ostentation, striving so far
to avoid a peremptory opinion of mine own wit, as I take it* ^n honor for
me to ascribe the little I deserve rather to the master that taught me, then
mine own diligence that formed and fashioned my Muses: only this I protest
for my self, that I have studied so much as in me lies to observe a true
decorum, which protestation I shall suppose for an indecorum also before it be
ratified by your allowance and favors. Yet in these my Madrigales I beseech you
esteem this, that I have not enforced the one to the other, but so fitly have
I linkt my Music to number, as each give to other their true effect, which is
to move delight, which delight, as Socrates witnesses in Platoes Philebo, is
the daughter of Harmony. This virtue being so singular in the Italians, as
only under that ensign they hazard their honor: I could advise the studious
in Music so to employ themselves, that they might seem to be rightly borne
under the sweet aspect of Venus, which, as the Astronomers witness, is the
Dominatrix in Musicians natiuities: it is the only grace in a Musician to
follow this course, so to fit both note and number as if like Twins of one
mother, they may seem to be all one which yields great abundance of variety.
To conclude, I so much love perfect harmony, as I earnestly entreat all the
professed in Music to fly discord amongst themselves: though in composing of
songs, it may be well taken, beseeching them so far to fly selfe-opinion
also, that aiming all of them at their Countries honor, not their own glory,
they may by this means and in this manner outstrip any stranger, and make
England as famous in Musitions, as it is and has been for soldiers: so
leaving my labors to your favorable judgment, to keep secret what may be
amiss. I take hearty leave.

A friend to all lovers and Professors of Music John Farmer.

^ YOu pretty flowers that smile for so^mers sake, pull in your ^ heads before my

VERO NIHIL VERIVS



To the right Honorable my very good Lord and Master, EDWARD DEVERE Earl of
Oxenford, Vicount Bulbeck, Lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord great
Chamberlain of England, JOHN FARMER wishes long life, health and happiness
with increase of honor.
MOst Honorable Lord, it comes not within the compass of my power to
express all the duty I owe, nor to pay the least part: so far have your
Honorable favors outstripped all means to manifest my humble affection, that
there is nothing left but praying and wondering. There is a canker worm that
breeds in many minds, feeding only upon forgetfulness, and bringing forth
no birth but ingratitude: to show that I have not been bitten with that
monster, for worms prove monsters in this age, which yet never any Painter
could counterfeit to express the vglines, nor any Poet describe to decipher
the highth of their ilnes: I have presumed to tender these Madrigales only as
remembrances of my service and witnesses of your Lordships liberal hand, by
which I have so long lived, and from your Honorable mind that so much have
loved all liberal Sciences: in this I shall be most encouraged, if your
Lordship vouchsafe the protection of my first fruits, for that both for your
greatness you best can, and for your judgment in Music best may: for without
flattrie be it spoken, those that know your Lordship know this, that using this
science as a recreation, your Lordship have ouergone most of them that make it
a profession. Right Honorable Lord, I hope it shall not be distasteful to
number you here amongst the favorers of Music, and the practisers, no more
then Kings and Emperors that have been desirous to be in the roll of
Astronomers, that being but a star fair, the other an Angels Quire. Thus
most humbly submitting my self, my labors, and what ever is or may be in me,
to your Lordships censure and protection: I humbly end wishing your Lordship as
continual an increasing of health and honor, as there is a daily increase of
virtue, to come to happiness.

Your Honors most dutiful servant to command JOHN FARMER.

To the Reader.
THe present age being so bewtified with excellent Poets and adorned with rare
Musitions, amongst whom some by public writings make an eliphant of a mouse:
other by strange Paradoxes strive to attain pre-eminence: I have thought good
amongst the rest, being as virtuously ambitious as any, to expose my self to
the world, clothing my infant in humility, not ostentation, striving so far
to avoid a peremptory opinion of mine own wit, as I take it an honor for
me to ascribe the little I deserve rather to the master that taught me, then
mine own diligence that formed and fashioned my Muses: only this I protest
for my self, that I have studied so much as in me lies to observe a true
decorum, which protestation I shall suppose for an indecorum also before it be
ratified by your allowance and favors. Yet in these my Madrigales I beseech you
esteem this, that I have not enforced the one to the other, but so fitly have
I linkt my Music to number, as each give to other their true effect, which is
to move delight, which delight, as Socrates witnesses in Platoes Philebo, is
the daughter of Harmony. This virtue being so singular in the Italians, as
only under that ensign they hazard their honor: I could advise the studious
in Music so to employ themselves, that they might seem to be rightly borne
under the sweet aspect of Venus, which, as the Astronomers witness, is the
Dominatrix in Musicians natiuities: it is the only grace in a Musician to
follow this course, so to fit both note and number as if like Twins of one
mother, they may seem to be all one which yields great abundance of variety.
To conclude, I so much love perfect harmony, as I earnestly entreat all the
professed in Music to fly discord amongst themselves: though in composing of
songs, it may be well taken, beseeching them so far to fly selfe-opinion
also, that aiming all of them at their Countries honor, not their own glory,
they may by this means and in this manner outstrip any stranger, and make
England as famous in Musitions, as it is and has been for soldiers: so
leaving my labors to your favorable judgment, to keep secret what may be
amiss. I take hearty leave.

A friend to all lovers and Professors of Music John Farmer.
