JACOBS THANKFVLNESSE TO GOD, FOR GODS GOODNESS TO JACOB.

A MEDITATION ON GENESIS 32.10.

Wherein by the way also the Popish Doctrine of Man's Merit is discussed.

By THOMAS GATAKER, B. of D. and Pastor of Rotherhith.

LONDON, Printed by JOHN HAVILAMD, for FVLKE CLIFTON, and are to be sold at his
Shop upon new Fishstreet Hill. 1624.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL Sir WILLIAM WHITMORE, of Apley in Salope, Knight; And
Mr. GEORGE WHITMORE of London, Alderman; Saving Health, true Honor, and
eternal Happiness.
RIght Worshipful, I stood obliged to the Stock you both sprang from, before
I was able to apprehend what such obligation meant. Your worthy Mother was one
of those that presented me to the sacred Laver, and that undertook there in
my behalf. She answered there for me, (...) P^^ q^am respondere possem: uti
Iunius vert^t, P^alm. 119.67.
when I could not answer for my self; and did further also then seal up her
free affection to me with a real testimony of her Love. Neither did her
kindness toward me then and there expire; but as it was often renewed in her
life time, when occasion thereof was offered, so it ceased not until her self
deceased. She performed one of the first religious offices for me soon after
my birth: and it was one of her last pious works to remember me, among others
whom she had performed the like office for, at the time of her decease. Some
monument of my thankful acknowledgement hereof being desirous to have extant,
whom should I address it unto rather than yourselves; the only two
Principalls now left of that Family? Being therefore moved to make public two
of my weak Discourses, containing the explication of two portions of
Scripture, of some near relation the one to the other; the one of them
relating a memorable example of the performance of that that is promised in the
other, to wit, of Gods blessing o^ those with temporal things, that are
careful to look after the spiritual: This of the twain I chose the rather
to present your Worships withal; partly, because at the motion of the one of
you, The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers.
being then Head of that worthy Society, which I acknowledge my self also a
debtor unto, it was by word of mouth at first delivered; and partly also, that
it may help (for the best also, even Genes. 35.1.
Jacob himself, in this kind need helps) to egg you on, whom God has
blessed with so large a portion of his bounty, unto those religious offices,
that by occasion of Jacobs example, men of your rank are therein encited
unto, whether risen from mean estate, as with him here it had been, or from
the first largely and liberally endowed, as your selves. The Work indeed is
grown much larger, than at first was delivered, by reason that a Question
between us and the Romanists, concerning Man's Merit, is therein now discussed,
which was then but touched upon and pointed at only; neither the streights of
time admitting overlong discourse then, nor such matter of controversy so
well befitting the occasion that then was. The rest, without any material
alteration or addition, is the same for substance that then it was. Which
recommending entirely, as now it is, to your Worships, together with my Love
and Christian service to you both, and mine hearty Prayers to God for the
welfare, spiritual especially, of you and yours, with the rest of the
Branches of that Family, wheresoever now transplanted; I take leave of you for
the present, and rest

Your Worships ever in the Lord, THOMAS GATAKER.

JACOBS THANKFVLNESSE TO GOD, FOR GODS GOODNESS TO JACOB.
GENESIS 32.10. I am not worthy of all thy Mercies, and all thy Truth, which
thou have showed unto thy Servant: For with my staff came I over this Jordan;
and now am I become two troops.


THese Words are parcel of a Prayer conceived by the Patriarch Jacob,
Coherence.
in a time of distress, after his departure from Laban, when Verse 6.
tidings were brought him that his Brother Esau was coming in arms against
him, with four hundred men at his heels.

Jacobs Prayer. Parts 4. Part 1.
His Prayer consists of four parts.

There is in it;

1. A serious Protestation concerning the ground of his journey, and his
leaving of Laban, to wit, Tu dixisti. Verse. 9.
Gods own Word: he had not done what he did of his own head, but by Chap.
31.3, 13.
Gods special direction: a good argument to assure him that God would therein
secure him, having his Word and Warrant for the ground of his Action. Summa est
Deum sequi ducem securitas. Incedit tutus qui ducem sequitur Deum. Ambr. de
Abraam, l. 1. c. 2.
He walks surely, that walks warily: He walks warily, that walks with
warrant.

Part 2.
2. An humble Confession and Verse. 10.
acknowledgement of Gods goodness toward him; illustrate and amplified by his
own unworthiness of it; and so Indignitatis agnitio, ingratitudinis amolitio.
a secret insinuation of his thankfulness for it.

Part 3.
3. An instant suite and Supplication to God, that he would vouchsafe to stand
by him in his present distress, and Verse. 11.
deliver him out of the great danger that he was in at that instant, walking in
no other way, than that God himself had set him in.

Part 4.
4. An Allegation of Verse. 12.
Gods gracious promises Chap. 28.14, 15.
formerly made him; which might seem likely to fail, and to be utterly
frustrate, if he were now left to the mercy of his merciless Brother, Text.
Part 2. Particulars. 1. Jacobs Unworthiness.
who minded nothing but the destruction of him and all his.

The words of my Text are the second Part: And therein are these Particulars;

1. His own Unworthiness; I am not worthy:

2. Gods Goodness; laid down, 2. Gods Goodness.


1. In the Grounds of it, Mercy, and Truth; Mercy in promising, Truth in
performing: Grounds 2. 1. Mercy. 2. Truth.



2. In a Fruit and effect of it; Jacobs present estate, now at his return from
Laban, compared with what it was, when he went thither: Fruit.

Jacobs Penury.

Gods Bounty.

General.

Jacobs Thankfulness.


He went over Jordan with his staff alone,

And he was now become two bands, or two troops.



Where first in General observe we, ere we come to the Particulars, (...)
Chrysostom. ^om. 8. sermon. 14.
Jacobs Thankes-giving promised before his Petition;

How before he come to crave what he would have of God, he does in thankful
manner mention what already he had received.

And withal note we, Observe. 1.
Arrogans oration, si ab homine quid petiturus, dicas statim, Da mihi, Hoc peto,
Debet inchoari Oration a laud Dei, ut sequatur supplicatio. Ambr. nomine de
Sa^ram. l. 6. c. 5.
The usual practice of Gods people to begin their prayers and petitions to
God with a thankful commemoration of mercies formerly received.

So Moses; Psalm. 90.1.
Lord thou have been our refuge from one generation to another. And the Saints
elsewhere; Psalm. 85.1.
Lord thou wast sometime favorable to thy Land, in bringing again the
Captivity of Jacob, etc. And; Psalm. 44.1.
We have heard, O God, from our Fathers reports, what wonderful works in
times past thou wroughtest for the^. And David; Psalm. 71.18, 19.
Lord, thou have kept me from my childhood up till now: Therefore will I talk
of thy wondrous works. Forsake me not now until mine old age, nor when I am
gray headed, etc.

Now this they do,

Reasons 2.
Partly, in regard of God;

And partly, in regard of themselves.

Reason 1.
First, in regard of God, to testify their Thankfulness to him, and Deum
siquidem ad ampliora d^ndu^ provocamus, quando sibi de praeteritis gratias
ref^ramus. Sicut agricola terraemillam diligentius colit, quae uberius fructum
reddit. Alex. Carpent. destruct. V^t. Par. 6. c. 4.
to incite him thereby the rather to vouchsafe them further favor, being so
thankful for the former. For Optima petitio ipsa gratiarum est actio.
Thanksgiving is the best, and Efficacissimu^ genus est rogandi gratias agere.
Pl^n. Paneg.
the most effectual form of Prayer. And Ascensus gr^tiarum descensus grati^.
Invitat ad magna, qui gratanter suscipit modica: and spem de futuris recipit,
qui transacta beneficia recognoscit: nec desperatione frangitur, qui magnorum
muneru^ consolatione r^boratur. Cassi^d. Variar.
the ascent of our thanks-givings to God, is a means to procure a more
plentiful descent of his mercies upon us. It is as a little water powered into
the Pump, when the Springs lie low, that brings up a great deal more
together with it: Or as Mirabili natura, siquis veli^ reputare, ut si uges
gignantur, ar^ores frutic esque viva^t, in coelum migra^e aquas, animamque
etiam herbis vitalem inde defer. Plin. hist. not. lib. 31. cap. 1.
the Vapors, that ascending up from the earth, are a means to bring down rain
for the watering of it, where it was parched and dried up; and so making it
fertile, where it was barren before.

Reason 2.
Secondly, in regard of themselves, to strengthen their Faith, in assurance of
future favor and safeguard from God, upon ground and experience of his former
goodness. For Sequentium rerum certitudo est praeteritarum exhibitio. Greg. in
Evang. hom. 1. Ex perception^ praeteritorum munerum firma fit expectatio
futurorum. Bern. de Temp. 18. and in Psalm. 90. Sermon. 7.
the receipt of former mercies gives good hope and assurance of future
favors. Psalm. 4.1.
Hear me, says David, when I call, Deus justitiae mi^i. Deus mi justissime.
Sicut Coloss. 1.13. Hebr. 1.3. Esai. 2.20. and 31.7. Quanquam potest exponi
etiam, Deus vindex and assertor justitiae meae: vti Iun. and alij.
O my righteous God, or God of my righteous cause. Thou have formerly delivered
me when I was in distress: Have mercy therefore now again on me, and give
ear to my prayer. And, Psalm 27.9.
Thou have been my succor; leave me not now, nor forsake me, Deus salutis,
pro salutifero: ut turris salutum, pro omni modo salutiaera. 2 Samuel 22. ul^.
O God my Savior. And, 1 Samuel 17.37.
The Lord that delivered me from the claws of the Lion, and the paw of the
Bear, will deliver me also out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine.
So the Apostle Paul likewise; 2 Cor. 1.10.
Who delivered me then, and does yet deliver me, and I trust that he will
further deliver me again. And again; 2 Timothy 4.16, 17, 18.
The Lord stood by me, when all forsook me: and I was delivered out of the
mouth of that Lion: Yea the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and
preserve me to his everlasting Kingdom.

That which may serve to teach us; Uses 2. Use 1.


First, to keep in mind carefully Gods former mercies, and not suffer them by
forgetfulness to slip away from us. We should be in this regard (to use the
Heathen man's comparison) like (...). Carneades apud Plut. de tranquil. Quod
Budaeus perperam est interpretatus, dum (...), esse existimavit. Sic qui pomum
in manu sua died midia tenuerit, reliqua diei part pomis^rvabit odorem.
Bernard. de Temp. 31.
Civet-boxes, which though the Civet be taken out of them, yet retain still
the sent of it: The sweet sent of Gods mercies and gracious deliverances should
remain still in our minds by a faithful and careful remembrance of them,
even when the act it self is over.

And this should we the rather do, that we may thereby be encouraged the more
constantly and confidently to depend upon God and his goodness for the time to
come. Inducement.
For this is one maine cause of our usual distrust of Gods Providence in times
of trouble, or in danger and distress, that Psalm. 78.7, 8, 10, 11, 12. Quod
scimus cum necesse no^ est, in necessitate nescimus. Bern. de Consider. l. 2.
we remember not what God has in former times done either for others, or for
our selves. This it is that makes men ready, when charge begins to come on
them, and things go backward with them, Psalm. 125.3.
to put their hands to iniquity, and by fraud and deceit, or by exaction and
oppression, or by becoming instruments of evil offices to great ones, to
seek to repair their losses, or to enlarge their estates: And men are wont to
pretend a kind of necessity of so doing; they should Largitio fontem ipsum
benignitatis exhaurit. Ita benignitate tollitur benignitas; qua quo in plures
vsus sis, eo minus in multos uti po^^^s. Cic. Offic. l. 2. and apud Lactant.
Instit. l. 6. c. 11. Hinc Hieron. ad Paulin. Etiam liberalitate perit
liberalitas.
not be able to defend the world (as they speak) unless they so did; there
would be no living for them in the world, if they did otherwise. As if God were
not as well able to provide for them then, as before-time he had been: as if
either continuance of time had weakened his hand, or by his former bounty his
wealth and treasury were exhausted or wasted: As with man it often falls out.
No: Esai. 59.1.
Gods hand is not shortened; his power is not impaired: Mat. 6.30. (...).
but thy trust in him is straightened; thy faith is not strengthened. It is not his
might, but thy faith, that fails. And one reason thereof is, because thou
call not to mind, what God has formerly done for thee, which he is able
also to do for thee still. And surely if we did but consider seriously, who it
was that Psalm. 22.9, 10.
kept us and fed us in our Mothers womb before we were borne, when neither
we could shift for our selves, nor our parents do ought for us, we might
well reason thus with our selves; He that preserved and maintained me without
any care or travel eith^r of mine own or others for me then, while I was yet
in my Mothers womb, is much more able by mine honest labors and endeavors to
do the same now for me and mine: he is able now to give me (...). 2 Cor. 9 8.
sufficiency by them, that then provided sufficiently for me without them.

Again, Use 2.
do we desire to have Gods goodness continued unto us, or enlarged toward
us? Let us be careful then to show our selves thankful unto him for mercies
formerly received. For (...). Grata mente nihil est Deo gratius: Et gratiarum
actio est ad plus dandum invitatio. Chrysostom. in Genes. hom. 52.
thankfulness for former mercies, is a strong inducement to move God to confer
further favors. Psalm. 67.5, 6.
Let the people (says the Psalmist) praise thee, O God; yea let all the people
join together in the praising of thee: And then shall the earth bring forth
her increase; and God will show himself to be our God, by multiplying his
mercies and blessings upon us. As on the other side, the want of it lies as a
block in the way between God and us to debar us of further blessings. For
Indignus est dandis, qui ingratus est pro datis. Aug. de Temp. citante Io.
Herolt. de Te^p. 112. Non est dignus da^dis, qui non agit grates pro datis.
Greg. laudante Gul. Perald. Sum. tom. 2. tr. 6. p. 3. c. 1. and in epist. Dom.
18. Pent. ser. 1. and in Euang. dom. 14. Trinit. Ser. 1. Accipiendis indignus
est, qui fuerit de acceptis ingratus. Bern. de Diverse. 27. and Iac. Genuens. de
Temp. 150.
he is unworthy of future favors, that is not thankful for former mercies.
And Gratiarum enim cessat decursus, ubi recursus non fuerit, Bern. de Temp. 40.
the course of Gods gracious goodness stops, where no recourse of
thanksgiving is. It is our unthankfulness Ingratitudo ventus exurens est,
exiccans sibi rorem misericordiae, fluenta gratiae. Bernard. in Cant. 51.
that stays and stauncheth the streams of Gods bounty, that they flow not
so freely as otherwise they would; Jn Halesina regione fons est quietus and
tranquillus cum siletur; si insonent tibiae exultabundus ad cantus elevatur,
and ultra margine^ extumescit. Solin. Polyhist. c. 11.
being like Ita sons divinae bonitatis ad laet^m gratia^um actione^ exuberat,
and beneficiorum suorum aquas inundat; subsidit, ubi ea deficit. Alex. Carp.
destruct. vi^. par. 6. c. 4.
the Spring Solinus speaks of, that rises and runs over while men sing
and play to it, but falls and sincketh again as fast, so soon as they
cease. Petitionibus effectum negat, quod ingrati invenimur. Bern. de diverse. 27.
That is it that causes our prayers, though we pray long, and sue hard, and
cry loud, often to fail; and causes God Quid sibi vult quod minus ergasuos
liberalis nunc divina clementia videatur, ut quibus tanta contulit nec
vocantibus, nunc orantibus, obsecrantibus, postulantibus sapissime, imo
continue minora multo denegare videatur* Bern. ibid.
not to answer them according either to our desires, or to his own wonted
dealings with others of his in times past; not that Non quod aut manus
abbreviata, a^t mutata voluntas, aut (...) facult^s. Sed quia non est inventur,
qui gratias (...). Idem ibid.
he is become either more Number. 11.23. Esai. 50.2. and 59.1.
short-handed, or close-fisted, or hard-hearted, now than heretofore he has
been; (for he is Semperidem. Psalm. 22.2, 3. and 102.27. Mal. 3.6. Heb. 13.8.
Iam. 1.17.
ever the same;) but because, with those Luke 17.17.
nine Leapers, we are more frequent and fervent in prayer than in praise, more
forward and earnest to sue for what we desire, than to return thanks for it
again when we are heard: Vt accipiant, ^importuni; donec acceperint, inquieti;
ubi acceperint, migrati. Bern. de Consider. l. 4.
Importunate to have; unquiet, till we have; and unthankefull, when we have
once gotten what we would have. Yea (...). Ph^^o de vita Mosis.
this it is that causes God, Quae c^ntulit gratis, tollit ingratis. Quod illo
dante fit nostrum, nobi^ super^ientibus fit ali^^um. Aug. H^mil. 14. Nec tantum
nihil a^getur ingrat^; sed and quod datum est, tollitur. Bern. de Temp. 40.
to bereave us often of those benefits and blessings that he has formerly
bestowed on us; as being but Quia dedisse poenitet, quod perisse videtur.

Because (says God of the unthankful Israelites) they say, I will go after
(...) amas^os meos.

wine and mine oil; and consider not, that it is I that gave them these things:
Therefore Revertar and tollam.i. tollam denuo, recipiam. Sicut Dan. 9.25.

I will come and take these things again away from them. And, Ezech. 29.3, 9.
because Pharao says, The River is mine own; Esai. 19.5, 6*
Therefore, says God, will I dry up the River. For the better understanding
whereof, and of some other the like passages in the Prophet, I shall tell you

the fruitfulness and fertility of their land did depend. And if we would not
have God to deal in the like manner with us, let us take heed how we be found
faulty in this kind, as they were. Let us call our selves rather to a due and
a strict account, how thankful we have been for Gods mercies toward us
fore-passed, how thankful we are for his favors which we enjoy at the
present; and how we come short and fail (as upon due search we shall find that
we do much the very best of us all) in either; that we may both repent us of
our unthankfulness toward him, and grow up daily more and more in
thankfulness for them.

only, but increase also, that that bred it.

And thus much for the General.

Proceed we now to the Particulars. Particulars.


Particular 1. Jacobs unworthiness.
Where first we find, Jacob confessing his own unworthiness:

Minor sum cunctis miserationibus tuis. Vulg.
Less than all those favors, (for so are (...)
the words in the Original) that God had vouchsafed him, and heaped up so
plentifully upon him.

Less than them, or any of them: Sense. Reason 1.
Because Minor sum, i. indignus sum m^serationibus tuis mihi impensis. Hug. Car.
Excedunt miserationes tuae merita mea. Propter substantiam hoc dicit, quam sine
meritis ^edit. Hier. Oleast. Jndignus in quem tot tantaque conferret. Calvin.
Piscat.
altogether unworthy of them; as not deserving, nor having right to require
ought, (and much less so much as he had received,) by way of due debt and
desert at Gods hands.

And again, Less than them, because Jnferior. i. Impar sum omnibus beneficijs
his. Iun.
unable to requite them: Reason 2.
For (...).
God and our Parents, (says the Heathen Man) cannot be requited.

Psalm. 116.12.13. Quaerebat quid retribueret, and non inveniebat. Imo quasi
aliquid invenit, rema^ sit in action gratiarum: nam in relatione defecit.
Gratias agere licet, refer non licet: non enim potes. Aug. in Psalm. 44.
David sought sometime how he might; but but he could not devise how. Quid
dicam aliud quam gratias gratiae ejus? Nos enim gratias agimus: non damus, nec
reddimus, nec referimus, nec rependimus gratiam. Idem in Psalm. 88.
Thanks alone he could return (a poor requital) and no more.

Where again observe we a second Practice of Gods people; Observe. 2.
When the godly repair to God for ought by Prayer, they are ever confessing
and acknowledging their own vileness and baseness, their inabilitie and
weakness, their indignity and unworthiness.

So Jacob here: and so his Grandfather Abraham before him; Genes. 18.27.
How should I that am but (...) noris and cinis.
dust and ashes, presume to speak to my Lord? And, 2 Samuel 7.18.
What am I? says David; or what is my pare^tage, that thou should afford me
such favors? And, Psalm. 8.4. and 144.3. Job 7.17, 18. Misericordiae tuae est,
non meritorum ipsius. Aug. de diverse. 20.
What is man that thou should regard him? or the son of Man that thou
should once think on him? Matthew. 3.11.
I am not worthy, says John the Baptist of our Lord Jesus, to carry his shoes
after him; or Make. 1.7. Luke 3.16.
to untie but his shooe-strings. Matthew. 8.8.
Unworthy, says the Centurion, that thou should come under my roof; or,
Luke 7.7.
that I should come once in thy presence. Luke 5.19, 21.
Unworthy, says the Prodigal Child, to be called thy Son. 1 Cor. 15.9. Si^
de se Ambr. de Poenit. l. 2. c. 8. Indignus vocari Episcopus.
Unworthy, says the Apostle Paul, to bear the name of an Apostle.

And what is the Ground of all this? Doubtless it arises, Grounds 2.


Partly from the Consideration of their own unprofitablenesse and
abominablenesse; Consider. 4.


And partly from the Consideration of Gods Majesty and greatness.

First from the Consideration of themselves. Ground 1.


(1) Their vileness and abominablenesse in evil. (2) Their poorness and
unprofitablenesse in good.
1. Their vileness and abominablenesse by reason of Sin. In regard whereof,
Consid. 1.
they are not unworthy only of ought that is good, but worthy of all evil, if
God in the rigor of his justice should regard them as in themselves they are.
Job 39.37.
Behold, I am vile; says Job: what should I say? Psalm. 51.5.
Bred in sin, says David, and borne in iniquity. And, Job 15.14, 15.
If the very heavens themselves, and Job 25.5, 6.
the stars (the brightest and cleerest part of them) be not clean in Gods
sight: How much more is Man* Lumbricus. Iun.
a mirie worm, unclean? Yea, Job 15.16.
how much more, (I say) is Man abominable, that drinks in iniquity like
water? Cui peccatum aeque familiare ac cibus and potus est. Iun.
With whom sin is as familiar as his ordinary diet, his daily meat and
drink is? Whereupon well says Augustine, entreating of those words of the
Psalmist, Psalm. 138.8.
Reject not, O Lord, the work of thy hands: Opus tuum in me vide, Domine, non
meum. Nam meum si videris, damnas me: Tuum si videris, coronas me. Na^ and quae
cunque sunt bona oper^ mea, abs te mihi sunt: et ideo tua magis qua^ mea sunt.
Aug. in Psalm. 137. Add quod Bern. de Temp. 48. Necesse est credere quod
aeternam vitam nullis potes operibus promereri, nisi gratis detur and ipsa.
Merita enim omnia dona Dei sunt: and ita homo magis propter ipsa Deo debtor
est, qua^ Deus homini. Quod idem and Durand. habet in Sent. l. 2. d. 28. q. 1.
Regard, O Lord, in me not my work, but thine own: for if thou regardest my
work, thou damnest me; if thine own work, thou crownest me. Since that
whatsoever good I have, I have it from thee: and it is therefore rather thine
than mine. For Romans 7.18.
I know, says the Apostle, that in me, that is, in this flesh of mine there
dwells nothing that is good.

2. Their poorness and unprofitablenesse even in the good that they do or
have.

1. The poorness and imperfection of that grace and goodness that is yet in
them, and of all that they do consequently, while they live here. For our
sanctification is here but in part. As 1 Cor. 13.9.
we know but in part: so we are purged but in part. Philip. 3.12.
I am not yet perfect, says the Apostle. And, Prove. 21.9.
who can say, I have so cleansed mine heart, says Solomon, Consider. 2.
that I am wholly free from sin? Yea as Maxima pars eorum quae scimus, est
minima eorum quae ignoramus. Aug.
the most that any know is the least of that they know not: so the most of the
sanctifying Grace that we have, is the least (for the most part) of that that
we want and should have. There are relics and remainders of the old man
still even in the best. They are not so Ephesians. 4.22. -- ut lubricus serpens
Exuit in spinis vestem. Lucret. de rer. Not. lib. 4.
stripped of their old garment, of their Genes. 41.14.
prison apparel, but that many a ragge of it hangs still upon them, and
Hebr. 12.1.
sticks so close to them, that they will not off all, till they go altogether
for good and all, till Romans 6.7.
death do that all at once, that 2 Cor. 3.18. and 4.16.
Grace does now by degrees. Though Ps^lm. 19.13. and 119.133. Romans 6.12 14.
Tit. 3.3.
Sin reign not in them, as Romans 6.17.
formerly it has done: yet it remains with them, and Romans 7.17, 20.
dwells still, like a bad Inmate, within them. Habitat; sed non regnat:
manet; sed non dominatur aut praevalet: Evulsum quodammodo, necdum tam^n
expulsum; dejectum, sed non prorsus eject^m tamen. Bern. in Psa. 90. s^rm. 10.
Eradicari siquidem aut extirpari penitus e cordibus nostris malitia non potest.
Idem de Temp. 45.
It remains, says Bernard, even in the best, though plucked up by the root,
yet not wholly pulled out; though dejected and thrown down in regard of its
regencie, yet not ejected or cast out in regard of inherencie. It is (...).
Proclus apud Epiphan. haeres. 64.
like a wild fig tree, says Proclus in Epiphanius, that has so pierced into
the stone-wall of a fair Temple, that though it be cut away, the boughs, body
of it, and the maine stumpe of it pulled out, yet some of the strings of the
root* Romans 7.19, 20, 21, 23.
ready ever anon to sprout out again, will abide there, do what can be
done, till the wall it self be dug down. It is as Levit. 14.36. -- 45.
the fretting Leprousie in an house, that though the walls be scraped over and
over, again and again, yet will not away, until the building be it self
wholly demolished. And Hagg. 2.15.
as we are our selves; so is all that comes from us. There is a tang and
taint of this rotten root in all that we do: as there is Tinguntur soli^
radij, eorumque trahunt similitudinem, in quorum or^m sube^^do venere. Plin.
hist. Not. lib. 2. cap. 18.
a tincture of the stained glass in the light that it gives, and in the rays
of the Sun, though pure otherwise themselves, that pass through it. Si de ^is
divinitus districte discuti^^r, quis inter ^^c remanet salu^^^ locus^ quando et
^ala nostra pura m^la sunt, and bon^qu^ (...) ^abere cr^dimus, p^ra (...)

astringi^^r, qua^libet (...) operibus insudemus, vera^ m^diti^^ nequaquam
appr^^endimus, sed imitamur. Ibid. l. 9. c. 28.
Our evil actions are merely evil, says Gregory, but our good acti^^^ (are
not, nay) cannot be purely good. They are but Ipsa et virtutum gaudi^ vulnus
habe^t. Prosper. in sentent.
maimed; says Prosper. They are Terret me vita (...). Na^que diligenter
discussa apparet mihi aut peccatum, aut sterilitas fere tota. Quod si quid
fructus in ea videtur, sic est aut simulatum, aut imperfectum, aut aliquo modo
corruptum, ut possit aut non placere, aut displicere Deo. Anselm. de miser.
homin.
so imperfect, and some way or other corrupt, says Anselme, that God might
well be displeased with them. Sed quid potest esse omnis justitia nostra c^ram
Deo? Nonne juxta Prophet^^, velut pannus menstruatae reputabitur? Et si
districte judicetur, injust^ invenietur (...) justitia nostra, and minus
habens. Bern. de Temp. 94.
Our righteousness is all (even the very best of it) in Gods sight, says
Bernard (alluding to the words of the Prophet Esai. 64.6.
Esaias) but as a menstruous clout (that is, as a filthy, beastly, abominable
rag) if it should strictly be examined: Nostra justitia, ^iqu^ est, humilis
justitia, recta f^rsitan, sed non p^ra. Nisi forte meliores nos esse credimus
paetribus nostris qui no^ minus ver^citer quam humiliter aiebant, omnes
justitiae nostrae, etc. Bern. de Verb. Esai. 5. Sic etiam explicant, hu^
applicant saltem verba illa Prophetae Orig. in Romans c. 3. Hieron. in Esai. c.
64. Aug. nom. soliloq. c. 28. Bern. in dedic. Eccles. 5. Ex Pontificij^ Hugo

Joan. cap. 3. and Matthew. cap. 12. Quod delet Index Expurg. Hisp.
Unless we esteem our selves better than our forefathers, who have no less
truly than humbly confessed so by themselves. And, if our best righteousness
be such; (no better than Sciunt Sancti, quia omnis justitia humana in^ustiti^
esse deprebenditur, si divinitus districte judicetur. Greg. Mor. l. 21. c. 15.
unrighteousness; says Gregory; a kind of In^ust^ justitia. Bern. supra.
unrighteous righteousness, says Bernard:) Quid ergo de peccatis erit, quando
ne ipsa pro se poterit respondere justitia? Bern. ibid.
what is our unrighteousness than? If Matthew. 6.23.
the light that is in us burn so dim, how is it with our darkness; which
for the most part is more than the light, even in those that have most?

Again, Consider. 3.
they consider as their poorness and imperfection in Grace; so their
unprofitablenesse, even in the good that they do out of Grace. For, Luke 17.10.
When you have done all that ever you can, says our Savior, say that you are
(for Sed hoc, inquies, propter humilitatem monuit esse dicendum. Plane propter
humilitate^. Sed nu^quid contra veritatem? Bern. de Diverse. 17. Nam quod
Chrysostom. in Ozian. ho. 3. (...): nihil huic repugnat sententiae; cum and ipse
alibi fateatur; (...). In Mat. hom. 3..i. non tam humilitas iderat quam sanum
judicium: vti vertit Bern. Brix. ad p^p. Ant. hom. 38.
so indeed you are, but) unprofitable servants. It is a Question moved by
Eliphaz in Job, Job 22.2, 3.
Whether a man can be profitable to God, as he may be profitable to Man, either
himself, or any other. And it is well resolved and answered by Elihu in the
Negative: Job 35.7. Iustitia nostra Deus non indiget. Totumque quod recte
colitur Deus ab homine, prodest homini non Deo. Neque enim fentise quisquam
dixerit profuisse quod biberit, aut luci, si viderit. Aug. de Civit. lib. 10.
cap. 5.
If thou do well, says he, what good do thou to God? or what is he the
better for it? And again, Job 35.6. Sed quae flagitia in te, qui non
corrumperis? aut quae adversus te facinora, cui noceri non potest? Sed hoc
vindicas, quod in sese homines perpetrant; qui cum in te peccant, impie agunt
in animas suas. Jdem Consess. l. 4. c. 8.
If thou do evil, what hurt do thou to him? Be thy sins never so many,
what is he the worse for it? No: Psalm. 16.2. Nec ille collat^ eget, nec nos ei
quicquam confer possumus. Sen. de benef. l. 4. c. 9. Nec eget bonis, nec
timet a malis. August. in Psalm. 80.
All my well-doing, says David, or my goodness, is nothing to my God. Ideo
Deus meus, quia bonorum meorum non indige^. Omne enim bonum nostrum aut ipse
est, aut ab ipso. Aug. epist. 5. and de doctr. Christ. l. 1. c. 31.
He were not God, says Augustine, if my well-doing could do him any good. For
Nos cum te am^mus, a te ad te afficimur, qui possumus misero aliquo mod^ ess^
and non amare te, hoc est, esse and male esse. Tibi autem qui semper idem es,
nihil accedi^ si amando proficimus ad te, nihil decedit, si non amando
deficimus a te. Guilel^. a S. Theod^ric. de amor. Dei, c. 8. quod Bernardo
perperam tribuitur.
God (says one well) being ever the same, is neither the better for our
goodness, nor the worse for our wickedness. He neither gains ought by us,
when we love and serve him, and cleave close to him: nor loses he ought by
us, when we love him not, but leave him and fall away from him. For Nec crescit
Deus, acc^dente (...) decrescit d^cedente te. Aug. in Psalm. 145. Si fueri^
fine D^o, min^^ eris: Si fueri^tum* Deo, major Deus non erit. Non ex te ille
major: sed tu fine illo minor. Reficieris, si accesseris: deficies, si
recesseris. Integ^r m^^et te a^^edente; integ^r manet and te cadente. Idem in
Joan. 11. Non erit major, si placet tibi; sed tu min^r eris, si d^pli^et tibi.
Ib. 18.
he can be well enough without us: but we can by no means do well without
him. And therefore he cannot be the better for us; howsoever we may be the
better for him. Ground. 2. Consider. 2.


Secondly, from the consideration of Gods infinite Majesty and dignity, his
worth and his greatness, that dampeth and obscureth all those their excellent
parts, for which others so much worthily and deservedly admire them. Psalm. 8.3.
Goodly Creatures are the Stars, and (...). Basil. Sell. hom, in Transfig.

they shine bright in the Night, but when the Sun is once up, all their light
and luster is gone, it is no more to be seen, than as if they were not: Nor
do those worthy Saints of God, whom we justly deem as bright Apoc. 1.20.
Stars, retain their glorious luster that yet dasteth our eyes, when they
appear in the presence of the Act. 7.2.
God of Glory. The nearer therefore Gods Saints approach to God, and consider
his worth and his greatness, the more apprehensive are they of their own
meannesse and unworthiness. And as (...). Plut. praecept. conjug.
the Moon never casts less light, than when she is nearest the Sun, from
whom she has it: so never does ought, (ought, I mean, that excels, that is
ought,) less appear in any of us, than when we approach nearest the Iam. 1.17.

Institut. lib. 1. cap. 1.
While we sit here in the Church together, and look one upon another, or upon
other things here about us, we may well seem to be well-eyed and quick-sighted
the most of us. But if the Sun should shine bright abroad, and we should go
out and look full on it, our eyes would be soon obscured and darkened, and
all our sharp-sightednesse would prove nothing but mere dimnesse and
darkness. And surely, if the very Seraphim themselves, though so glorious
Creatures in themselves (that Dan. 10.7, 8, 11, 16, 17. Luke 1.12. Act. 10.^.
their presence when they appear but in some glimpse only of that their
celestial glory, is wont to strike such terror and astonishment into those
to whom they appear in that manner) yet when they cast their eyes on that most
glorious Malac. 4.2.
Sun of Righteousness, this Psalm. 8.3. and 74.16.
Suns Creator, the Author of its excellency, and Esai. 24.23.
infinitely therefore more excellent than it, they are so abashed at the
consideration of their own vileness in comparison of it, that Esai. 6.5.
they clap their wings on their faces, ( (...). Chrysostom. in Esai. cap. 6.
as men are wont to do their hands, when the lightning flasheth in their eyes)
as wholly overwhelmed with it, and not easily enduring it. No marvel if 1
King. 19.17.
Elias, when God spoke unto him, (though in no terrible manner, but with a
still voice, yet) cast his mantle over his face, as abashed at his appearance;
and if other the Saints of God, when by prayer they repair unto God, and Ier.
36.19. Act. 10.33. Eccles. 5.2.
set themselves in his special presence, Psalm. 16.8.
beholding God as it were then looking with full eye upon them, and Psa. 27.4.
et 42.2.
looking him in a manner full in the face, do then especially, as take notice
of, so confess and acknowledge, their unworthiness to approach so glorious a
presence, and to require or expect ought from the hands of such a Majesty,
being so mean, so vile, so base, so abominable, as they are, and do then
especially see themselves to be. Luke 5.8.
Lord depart from me; I am a sinful wretch; says S. Peter to our Savior,
when in a strange draught of fish only, he saw some print of his Deity. And,
Job 42.5, 6.
I have often heard of thee by report; says Job to God: but now mine eye sees
thee: And therefore do I even abhor my self; and repent me in dust and
ashes; in Genesis 2.7. and 3.19. and 18.27. Sirac. 10.9.
such as my self am. Men are then (...). Pythag. apud* Plut. de Superstit. and
de defect. o^ac.
holiest (says Pythagoras) when they repair unto God: they are humblest sure
(say I) when they approach nearest to him.

Now this may serve first to teach us Humility. Use 1.
For if so worthy Saints and servants of God account themselves unworthie of
ought, and think and speak so meanly of themselves; what does it behove us
to do, that come so far short of them? There are two Virtues especially,
that our Savior Christ has by his own example commended unto us, to be
imitated of us; Humilis venit. Z^ch. 9 9. Mat. 21.5. humilitatem docere venit.
Matthew. 11.29. August. in Joan. 25. Discite a me, inquit. Quid discimus a te?
nescio quid magnum a magno artific^. Nunquid ut eadem cum illo faciamus? Qui
potest, quae solus Deus facit? Hoc disce a me* quod factus sum pro te. Quid
prodest, si miracula facis, and humilis non sis? Idem hom. 34. Nolo a me
discatis, sacere quae feci; sed quod factus quifeci, ne p^rirent quae feci.
Idem de verb. Ap. 12.
Humility in his Life, and Job. 13.34, 35.
Love or Charity at his Death: Which we may well therefore term Quo modo de
Fide Basil. apud Greg. Naz. in Epitaph. (...). Et de Charitate and Pa^e,
Chrysostom. in Hebr. hom. 31. (...).
Christ's cognisances; and the marks and badges of those that be his. And
certainly where Humility is wanting, that is wanting that Gods Children have
ever most of all abounded and excelled in. All their speeches and sayings
generally (if you mark them) savor strongly of it. Pulvis and cinis. Genesis
18.17.
Dust and ashes, says Abraham. Vermis, non Vir. Psalm. 22.6.

And where men therefore are so prone to stand upon terms of Comparison; I am
as good a man as such and such: and, I deserve as well as they: and, I see no
reason why I should not be respected as well as any other: and are so ready to
thrust themselves forward; and not Romans 12.10. Phil. 2.3.
in giving honor to others, as the Apostle exhorts, but Hebr. 5.4.
in taking honor to themselves, which the Holy Ghost reproves, strive to go
beyond others: it savoureth not of Matthew. 11.29. Col. 3.12, 13.
the Spirit of Christ, nor of that Romans 8.14.
Spirit that Gods Children are led by; but of the Spirit and humor rather of
those, who in the Gospel are reported to have Matthew. 23.6, 7. Mar. 12.38.39.

Where the true fear of God is, Pride is not: and consequently, that where

no Virtue more acceptable and well-pleasing to God than Humility: so there is

Var. l. 3. epist. 3.
no Vice in Gods sight more abominable than Pride. It is a strange thing, says
Augustine, entreating of those words of the Psalmist, Psalm. 138.6.
Though the Lord be on high himself, yet beholds be the lowly: as for the
proud and hautie, he knows them afar off. Vide^e magnum miraculum: Alius
est Deus; erigiste, and fugit a te: inclinas te, and descendit ad te. Humilia

Nescio quo pacto ^amiliarius semper humilitati propinquare solet divinitas.
Ber. ep. 42.
It is a strange thing, says he, and yet as true as it is strange: God he
sits aloft himself in heaven: and yet the higher a man lifts himself,
the further he is from him; the lower a man stoopeth, the nearer he is to him.
We have a very pregnant instance of it in the Pharisee and the Publican, by our
Savior propounded. Luke 18.11, 13.
The proud Pharisee pressed as near God as he could: the poor Publican, not
daring so to do, stood aloof off. And Pharisaeus contempsit de longinquo
stante^, cui Deus confitenti propinquabat. Pharisaeus de propinquo stabat; sed
Deus ad illum de propinquo non stabat. Publicanus de longinquo stabat: sed Deus
ad illum de long* non stabat. August in Psalm. 31. Publ. de long. stabat, and
Deo tamen propinquabat. Publ. de long. stabat: sed Dominus illum de prop^nquo
attendeba^. Idem de verb. Dom. 36.
yet was God far from the proud Pharisee, but near to the poor Publican.

de poenit. l. 2. c. ^0* (...). Basil. Sell. hom. 34.
The latter went away justified rather than the former. For Psalm. 34.18.
the Lord is near unto all those that be of a contrite heart: And Esai. 57.15.

The Low valleys are watered, when the high hills remain thirsty: And Luke

In a word; (...). Greg. Naz. de Eutax. Non est periculum quantumcunque te
humilies, quantumcunque reputes minore^ quam ^is. Est autem grande malum,
horrendumque periculu^, si vel modico pli^^ vero te ext^llas* Bern. in Cant. 23.
much danger there is in Pride; there is not the like in humility, albeit a
man should abase himself somewhat more, than were meet or requisite for him to
do. Quemadmodum enim si per ostium transeas, cujus superliminare ni^iu^ bass^m
sit, non nocet quantumcu^que te inclinaveris; nocet ^^te^ si vel transversi
digiti spatio plu^ quam ostij patitur mensura ^rex^ri^, ita ut impingas and
capite qu^ssato collidaris. Sic in anima no^ est plane timenda quantalibet
humiliatio; ^orrenda a^te^ nimiumque pavenda v^l m^^ima temere praesumpta
erectio. Bern. ibid. Humilis est janna Christus Dominus. Qui intrat per ha^c
ja^^am, humiliet se ^portet, ut (...) capite intrare contingat. August. in
Joan. 44.
In coming in at a low portall, if a man stoop never so low, there is little
danger in so doing; but if he hold up his head an inch only too high, he may
chance to get a sound knock, if not a broken brow by it.

Secondly, this may well discover one reason unto us, why our suits and prayers
many times prevail not with God, but are returned back to us without fruit
and effect; Uses 2.
to wit, Micha 6.6, 7, 8. Orandi disciplina repr^batrix superbiae,
justificatrix humilitatis; Deum docet ^rare in humilitate, ut allevatorem
humilium, non in superbia, ut destructorem superborum. Tertul. in Marc. lib. 4.
because we are not so humbled as we ought to be, ere we come to commence them;
because we are not so affected as Jacob here, with any serious consideration or
apprehension of our own indignity and unworthiness: The want whereof
breeds Eccles. 5.1, 2.
irreverence and Esai. 58.2, 3. Praesumpti^ enim arroganti propior est (...)
^^ganti. Ambros. de Poeniten. lib. 2. cap. 8.
presumption in us, the very bane and pests of Prayer.

There are three special faults in Prayer, says Bernard, that hinder the
success of it; Est trepida, est tepida, est temeraria oration. Bern. de Temp.
43. Terr^r, tep^r, (...). Gilbert. in Cant. 33.
Faintness, Coldness, and Boldness:

There is first a faint, a fearful, a distrustful Prayer:

There is secondly a cold, a formal, a superficial Prayer:

And there is thirdly a bold, a proud, a presumptuous Prayer. And this last is
the worst.

Trepida nec procedit quidem, nedum ascendit.
The faint and fearful prayer cannot get out, much less get up: it sticks
fast between the teeth, or in the throat rather.

Tepida procedit, sed in ascen^u languescit and deficit.
The cold and formal prayer comes forth fast enough, but it cannot get up: it
freeseth (for want of spirit and fervor) by the way, ere it come to appear in
Gods presence. Iam. 5.16.
A good man's prayer is effectual, says S. James; but provided it be fervent.

Temeraria ascendit, sed resil^^: n^c tantum non obtinet gratiam, s^d meretur
offensam. Bern. ibid.
The bold and presumptuous prayer flies up apace; but it is as fast beaten
back again, for presenting it self over-boldly and saucily in Gods sight;
and in stead of a blessing, it brings back a curse with it. (...). Basil.
Sell. hom. 34. Velut dignus, qui cum Deo cominus colloqueretur. Erasin. Paraphr^.
Such was that proud Pharisees prayer before spoken of. Luke 18.10.
He went up, says our Savior, into the Temple to pray. But when he was
arrived there, Non inveni^bat quod peteret. Gilb. in Cant. 33. Gratias, inquit,
ago, quod nihil pe^cavi: Non habeo quod ignos^as. Optat. contr. Parmen. l. 2.
Aut sui oblitum, aut a culpis ablutum dicas. Bern. de Grad. humil.
he had nothing to ask. He thrusts himself forward, and offers God a
sacrifice of praise indeed; but of his own, not of Psalm. 50.14, 23.
his. He (...). Basil. Sell. ubi sup.
spends the time not with Jacob in the confession of his own unworthiness,
but in (...), etc. Idem ibid. Purae ^^tae Pont^ficiorum Votariorum ampullae:
Quibus optime quadr^nt and Chrysostom. illa de Compunct. 2. (...).
commemoration of his merits and good-deeds unto God; for fear lest God should
forget them, or not esteem of him as his worth (he thought) well deserved that
he should.

True it is indeed, that even Gods sincere Servants, as Esai. 38.3.
Ezechias, Neh. 13.14, 31.
Nehemie, Job 10.7. and 23.10, 11, 12.
Job, and Psalm. 44.17, 18, 20.
others do upon special occasion sometime make mention, and that in Prayer
too, of the sincerity of their hearts, their upright carriage, and their
careful endeavor for Gods glory, and the good of 1 Timothy 3.15.
his house, the Church. But if we shall advisedly compare these and the former
together, we shall find a far different strain and spirit in either; we may
discern as much difference between the one and the other in their prayers, as
Plurimum interest inter barbarica^ immanitatem, affe^t^sque impotentes, qui
faciant ut vel mortem impavidi perserant; and Martyrum modestissima^
constantia^ in se i^becillem, in Christo ^ortem. Cypriani nomine de duplic.
martyr.
between the vainglorious confidence of Heathen Philosophers, and Scilicet
contemptum mortis in multis videas. Sed placidum illud, (...) ma^s^etum, illud
humil^ter sublime, and sublimiter humile nisi in Christi Martyribus non
videmus. Ibid. Magnitudo cum mansuetudine. Sen. epist.
the religious constancy of Christian Martyrs in their ends. There is a
vaunting Pride joined with a scorn of others in the one: There is a necessary
and lowly touch (either in way of Psalm. 7.3, 4, 8. and 17.3. and 26.1, 2, 3.
just apology, or Psalm. 26.8, 9. and 27.7, 8, 9.
to strengthen their faith in some hope of speeding with God, and having their
suites heard of him) of their own sincerity and integrity in the other.

And howsoever therefore we may likewise on the like occasions do the like, so
be we remember withal to do it also in the like manner as they did: Yet
Eccles. 5.1, 2.
we must take heed how we offer to press over-boldly and presumptuously into
Gods presence; lest as Jacob speaks elsewhere, and upon another occasion,
Genesis 27.12.
we bring a curse upon our selves in stead of a blessing. Rather Omnino siquide
oportet nos orationis tempore curiam intrare coelestem, in qua Rex regu^
stellato s^de^ solio, circundante innumerabili and ineffabili beatorum
spirituu^ exerci^u. Quanta ergo cum reverentia, quanto timore, quanta illuc
humilitate accedere debet e palude sua procedens and repens vilis ranuncula?
Bern. de diverse. 25.
consider we the greatness and the gloriousness, on the one side, of that
unconceiveable Majesty that in prayer we approach unto; and on the other side,
our own vileness, indignity, and unworthiness; that being truly humbled in
the view both of the one and the other, our Prayers so seasoned, may both find
freer access to God, and return with better success to us.

Thirdly, this directly crosses and controlleth that Popish conceit of Merit,
properly so termed, of matter of worth and desert in Man. Non sum dignus; I am
not worthy of ought; Use 3.
says Jacob: and Legatur Chrysostom. in Matthew. hom. 3. and hom. 25. and tom. 8.
Sermon. 16.
it is the common and general note (as you have heard) of Gods Servants.
Whereas our Romanists teach their followers to plead to God for themselves, as
the Jews did sometime for the Centurion to our Savior; Luke 7.4.
Dignus est; He is worthy; he deserves, that thou should do this for him.
Apoc. 4.11.
Dignus es: Thou art worthy to receive honor and glory; sing the Saints of God
to God. But, Digni sumus: We are worthy; do they sing, and teach theirs so to
sing: We are worthy, that God should confer honor and glory on us: We
deserve by our well-doing, not grace only, but glory too, even eternal glory:
And Quo modo Bellarm. ratiocinatur de Poenit. l. 2. c. 8. Si opera justorum eam
vim habent, ut vitam aeternam vere and proprie mereantur; nullo modo negari
potest, quin etiam efficacia esse possint ad satufaciendu^ pro reat^ poenae
temporalis: Siquidem long majus est gloria aeterna, quam poenae te^poralis
remissio. Absurdum ergo quod Them. sum. par. 1 a. 2 ae q. 114. a. 3. e. 10.
Vitam aeternam sub merito cadere; bona temporalia non cadere.
much more then any temporal benefits and blessings whatsoever, that come
far short of either. Psalm. 115.1. 1 Cor. 15.10.
They give all to God: these take all to themselves. There is on their parts
nothing but indignity with the one; nothing but condignitie with the other.
Jacob deemeth himself unworthie of ought; and they esteem themselves Worthy
of the Crown; worthy of the Kingdom; worthy of Heaven; worthy of Salvation;
worthy of God himself; as meriting and deserving all this Rhemists on 2 Thessalonians. 1.5. and Apoc. 3.4.
worthy of any thing. There was nothing that he could; and there is nothing
but that they do, or can deserve it at Gods hands. He knows not how to
requite what already he has received: they are able not to requite it only,
but to merit also much more. A strange presumption, whereby men dare arrogate
and ascribe that unto themselves, that none of Gods holy ones, whose stories
are recorded in Gods word, ever did, or durst do.

Take we Example in this kind, but by one of them for all. Job, the only man
of note in the time he lived in, for Job 1.1.
a just, and an upright, or a perfect man, one that feared God, and eschewed
evil: Job 1.8. and 2.3.
no one like him (by 1 Ioh. 5.9. 2 Cor. 10.18. (...). Chrysostom. de Compunct. 2.
Gods own testimony) in the whole World then besides. And yet Post tam magnu^
de illius justitia Dei testimonium, quid de se ipse? Aug. de Pec. Mer. and Rem.
l. 2. c. 10. (...), ( Job 31.) (...). ( Job 9.15.) Chrysostom. ubi supra.
how he stood herein affected, his own words will best show: wherein observe
we how in stripping himself of all matter of merit, worth, or desert, he
proceeds and goes on as by certain stairs and degrees.

Degrees 4. Degree 1.
First* Job 9.2.
How can any man, says he, be justified, if he be (...) Hebr. Q^om^do
justificabi^ se ^o^o cum (...). Quomodo (...) invenietur, s^ cum De^ (...)*
Vatabl. Q^^^quam potest etiam exponi, cum Deo.i. apud Deum, vel, coram (...) ut
Psalm. ^43.^. Et sic Aug. ubi supr^* Ante deum.
with God? Job justitiae Dei comparatione hominis justitia^^ nullam esse
d^clar^t. Annot. in Vatabl* ^ibl*
He shows that Man* justice is just none, says the Scholiast, if it be
compared with Gods justice. For, Cujus participatione justi sunt, ejus
comparatione n^c justi sunt. August. ^mtr. Priscil. and Orig^n. c. 10. ex Job
4.18. unde site Hug. C^^d. ex Greg. Moral. l. 9. c. 1. Homo Deo suppositus
justitiam percipit, compositus amittit. 1 Samuel 2.2.
Even those that are just by participation from him, are not just at all, if
they come once in comparison with him, says Augustine.

But how would the case stand with him, if he come to be tried not by that
infinite depth of justice that is in God, but by the exact rule of
righteousness, that of man God requires, and is contained in Gods Law? Job
9.3.
If a man, says Job, would go to law with God, or if God should call man to a
strict account, Degree 2.
man were not able to answer God for one of a thousand. Among a thousand of his
works, though having done Job 31. per totu^.
so many good works, could not Job pick out any one, of which he durst say,
This I dare be tried by; or I dare offer this to the strictest trial. Sanctus
vir omne virtutis meritu^ esse vitium conspicit, si ab interno arbitro
districte judicetur. Greg. Moral. l. 9. c. 1.
The holy Man, says Gregory, saw that all our worthy virtues would prove
vicious, yea vices, if they were brought to a strict trial. And, Qui de
perfectione se erigit, habere s^ been vivendi nec initium indicat. Idem ibid.
Cum itaque de bonae vitae perfectione extollimur, hanc nos nec inchoasse
mons^ramus. Jbid.
The man therefore that vaunteth himself of his perfection, thereby shows
that he has not yet so much as begun to lead a good life. So that, Job 9.20.
If I would justify my self, says Job, mine own mouth, (if according to Os
meum. i. conscientia mea. Hugo Car^.
mine heart it speak) must needs condemn me for so doing; when I see, my
self, so much amiss with me, when I know so much evil by my self.

But suppose he were not guilty in this manner to himself, Degree 4.
that he saw no such thing in himself, or knew nothing amiss by himself.
Job 9.21.
If I were perfect, says he; yet do I not know mine own soul. As if he
should say, as S. Paul sometime did; 1 Cor. 4.4.
Though I knew nothing by my self, (as Nihil mihi conscius sum infidelis
dispensationis, Cajetan. Nullius malae fidei aut negligentiae in fungendo
Apostolatu, Piscat.
in some kind and case the Apostle professes of himself, to wit, for his
demeanure toward the Corinthians, his faithful carriage in his Ministry, and
those things especially which the false Apostles charged him with, as 2 Cor.
1.12.
he elsewhere expounds himself:) yet were I not thereby justified. Or as
David, in Augustines Paraphrase of him, Quan^u^libet rectus mihi videor,
producis tu de Thesauro tuo regulam; coaptas me ad eam, et pravus invenior,
Aug. in Psalm. 142.
How right and straight soever I seem to my self, thou bring a rule out of
thy Treasury, which when thou layest me to, I am found faulty. For, Psalm.
19.1^.
Who (says the Psalmist) understands all his own errors? Ierem. 17.9.
Man's heart (says the Prophet) is deceitful above all things: so deceitful,
that Galat. 6.3. Jam. 1.26.
it deceives often even it self. And S^pe ipsa justitia nostra ad examen divine
justiti^ deducta injustitia est: and sordet in districtione judicis, quod in
aestimatione fulget operantis. Greg. Moral. l. 5. c. 7.
those things, says Gregory, that make a goodly show, even in a man's own
eyes, appear many times but foul, slubbred and sullied in Gods sight. Tanta
est profunditas in homine, ut lateat ipsum hominem in quo est: sed Dominum
latere no^ potest. Ier. 17.9.10. Herv. in 1 Cor. 4.
No man sees exactly the depth of his own heart. But 1 John 3.20. Quantum
possunt homines de alio judicare, plus homo utique de se. Sed Deus plus de
^omine, quam hom^ de se. Herv. ibid.
God is greater than our heart, and sees often that in it, and in the actions
that flow from it, that we see not in it or them our selves; and Ille magis
novit me, qui est scrutator cordis mei. Philip. in Job 9.
knows consequently more by us, than we know by our selves. As Paul
therefore, so Job, though he could neither be justly taxed for ought by others,
nor did know ought amiss by himself; though it had been so, I say, with him
(as yet Job 9.2, 20, 28, 29, 30, 31.
far otherwise it was) that he had passed well both Tria sunt judi^ia,
humanum, propriu^, divinum, de exterioribus quae sensui patent, judicat
humanum: de interioribus etiam hominis ipsius spiritus; sed long praestantius
D^us; cujus nondu^ fatetur Ap. evasisse judicium, qui t^men jam humanum
transce^disset et proprium: porro humanum contemnebat, nec proprium timebat,
divinum tantum restabat. Bern. de diverse. 32. Vide Thom. Aquin. in Job 9. Lect.
3. and Greg. Mor. l. 5. c. 7.
man's judgment, the strictest censure of others, and his own too, the
testimony of his own Conscience; yet durst he not, for all that, offer
himself to Gods judgment, there to be tried by the rigor and severitie of
Gods justice; well wotting that for all this there he might fail, as both
having deceived others, and having been deceived in himself; whereas there he
was Hebr. 4.12.
to deal with him, who is so Act. 1.24. et 15.9.
well seen in man's heart, Psalm. 33.15.
his own work, that he Gal. 6.7. Ier. 17.9, 10.
cannot possibly by any means be deceived therein.

Lastly, Job 9.15.
Though I were never so just, says Job, yet would I not argue with God, but
make suite unto my Judge. I would not argue, Petendo justiti^.
by demanding justice; but make suite, Petendo misericordiam, Lyra.
by craving mercy, says Lyra. I would not argue, Confidens in meritis meis.
trusting to mine own merits; but make suite, Plus co^fidens in ejus
misericordia, qua^ in meritis meis, Hugo Card.
trusting rather, says Cardinal Hugh, to his mercy. Degree 4.
Quoniam misericordia nobis necessaria est, August. in Job 9.
For it is mercy that we stand in need of, says Augustine: it is that that
must stand us then in stead. Since that, Vt saepe dixi^^^, Omnis humana
justitia injustitia esse convincitur, si d^stricte judicetur, Greg. Moral. lib.
9. cap. 14.
All man's Righteousness will appear to be but unrighteousness, says
Gregory, if it should strictly be examined. And Prece igitur post justitiam
indiget, ut quae succumbere discussa poterat, ex sola judicis pictate
convalescat, Gregor. ibid.
therefore for all a man's righteousness he had need yet to pray; that, that
that might in such strict trial fail, may by his Judges mercy alone hold out
and be made good. For it is all one, says he, as if Job had there said, Velut
si apertius fateatur dicens; Etsi ad opus virtutis excrevero, ad vitam non ex
meritis, sed ex venia convalesco. Idem ibidem.
Albeit I grow up and attain to good works, yet it is not of merit, but of
mercy, that I do atchieve life. And such Preci itaque innitendum est, cum
recta agimus, ut omne quod just vivim^, ex humilitate condiamus. Ibid.
Prayer therefore must we lean unto, even when we do well, that even all our
holy life may be seasoned with humility: Which the contrary presumption belike
then of merit, desert, worth, and dignity, is in Gregory's judgment a great
enemy unto.

But so absurd and even sottish is the Popish Doctrine in this Point, that some
of their chief Champions, as half ashamed of it, seek sometime to qualify
it, and sometime flatly deny it.

Sometime, I say, they seek to temper, and to qualify, and to correct it, as
Apothecaries do Nam and ipsa venena inferu^tur medicamentis. Isidor. Orig.
lib. 12. cap. 4.
poisons, when in desperate cases they minister them, to try Conclusions with
forlorn Patients. Thus Bellarmine having at large discussed the Point; laid
down a good distinction for the clearing of the difference between us and
them, when we say, that Calvinus docet nullam in proprijs meritis fiduciam esse
locandam. Institut. l. 3. c. 12.. 3, 4.
No Confidence is to be put in Man's Merits; and they say, Nos aliquam etiam in
meritis poni posse docemus. Bellar. de Iustif. l. 5. c. 7.
that some may be; to wit, that Aliud est fiducia^ nasci ex meritis: aliud in
meritis pone^dam. Bellar. ibid.
it is one thing for Confidence to be put in them, and another thing for
Confidence to arise from them: and with a trembling kind of assertion affirmed
the former, that not only Confidence may arise from them; but that In bonis
meritis, quae vere talia esse compertum sit, fiducia aliqua collocari potest,
modo superbia ca^^atur. Ib.
some Confidence also may be placed in them, if men be certain that they are
such, and so that they be not proud of them: (And yet how sorteth this their
doctrine, I pray you, with their Prayers, where they say; Deus, qui conspicis,
qui^ in nulla nostra action confidimus. Collect. in Sexages.
God, that see that we trust in nothing that we do? Or what is this then,
but even to mock God to his face, when they tell him they do not that, which
indeed they do?) At length he comes to conclude that we have the safest
course on our side. As Vtilissimu^ est coram Deo non justitia^ praetendere, sed
misericordiam postulare, Bern. ep. 41.
it is the best and behouefullest course; says Bernard, not to pretend merit,
but to request mercy: So it is the surest and the safest course, says
Bellarmine, not to trust in any work or worth of our own, but to rely wholly
upon Gods mercy. For, Propter periculum inanis gloriae, et incertitudinem
justitiae nostrae; Tutissimum est fiduciam totam in sola Dei misericordia and
benignitate reponere, Bellar. de Justice. lib. 5. c. 7.
In regard, says he, of the uncertaintie of our own righteousness, and the
jeopordie of vainglory, it is the safest course for a man to repose his
whole trust in the mercy and goodness of God alone. And he produces to this
purpose the speeches and practices of diverse holy men of God lying upon their
deathbeds: (as indeed the most, even Papists also, yea and some Popes too,
whatsoever they were taught or held otherwise while they lived, are glad (to
prevent the worst) to die Protestants in this Point, and to renounce all their
pretended merits, worth, and works then, when they should stand them most in
stead:) For so Ambrose at point of death, says he, spoke to his people; Non
sic vixi, ut me pudeat inter vos vivere: nec mori timeo, quia bonum Dominu^
habemus, Paulin. in vit. Am.
I have not so lived among you, that I should be ashamed to live longer with
you: nor am I afraid to die, because we have a good Master. Which speech of his
Augustine used much to admire and commend; affirming that Ambrose so said, Ne
crederetur praefidens de suis purgatissimis moribus praesumere, Possidon. in
vit. Aug.
that he might not be thought presumptuously to put confidence in his course
of life and carriage, though never so pure. So Augustine likewise himself to
his Adversaries; Ad existimatione hominum magna testium, qui me noverunt,
suppetit copia: ad Dei vero co^spectum sola conscientia; quam contra vestras
criminationes cum intrepida^ geram, non me tamen sub oculis omnipotentis
justificare audeo; magisque ab illo effluente^ misericordiae largitatem, quam
judicis summum exame^ expecto, Aug. contra Cres^^n. l. 3. c. 80.
For my reputation among men, I have witnesses great store, that have known
me, to testify for me: but in the sight of God my conscience alone can speak
for me; which albeit I bear fearelesse against your false accusations, yet
dare I not justify my self before the eyes of the Almighty, but expect
rather a largess of mercy flowing from him, than a strict judicial trial.
And Bernard of himself; Praetendat alter meritum; sustinere se jactet pondus
diei and ^stus. Mihi ad^^rere Deo bonu^ est, ponere in Domin^ Deo spem meam.
Bern. in Psalm. 90. Sermon. 9.
Let others plead their merits, and boast and brag that Matthew. 20.12.
they ha^^ (...) and endured the heat and the burden of the day: but Psalm.
73.^8.
it is good for me to cleave to God, and to put my trust in him. And when he
was even at deaths door, writing to some of his friends; Orate Salvatore, u^
tempesti^um (...) e^itum no^ differat, sed custodiat. Curate munire vobis
calcancum nudum meritis, Bern. epist. 310.
Pray ye my Savior not to delay now my timely departure, but to keep and
protect me in it. Be careful by your prayers to fence mine heel being bare
of merits it self. Vbi B. Bern. ex co^scientia bonae vitae ^^^at non differri
diutius m^rtem. Et tamen adeo non (...) meritis, (...) existimar^^ (...) esse
meri^^^. B^llar. de Iustific. l. 5. c 7.
Where S. Bernard, says Bellarmine, howsoever out of the conscience of his
good life he desired to have his death no longer delaied, yet was so far
from trusting in his merits, that he made account he had none. And again,
C^m extremum (...) spiritu^ videretur, Gulielm. in vit. Ber. l. 1. c. 13.
when he was even now (as it were) at the last gasp; F^t^or, non sum dignus
ego, (...) pos^^m propri^^ meritis regnum obtinere c^lor^m. Ca^^rum Dominus
meus dup^^ri jure illud (...), h^redi^ate P^tris and merit^ passionis, a^^er^
ipse (...), alteru^ mihi don^^. ^er. ib.
I confess, says he, that I am not worthy of, nor can by mine own merits
obtain the kingdom of heaven: But my Lord Jesus Christ, who holds it by a
double right, the inheritance of his Father, and the merit of his passion,
contenting himself with the one, bestows on me the other. This then has
been, by our Adversaries their own confession, the ordinary practice of Gods
people, even the greatest, the godliest, the worthiest of them. And can we
imagine but that their Faith and their Doctrine then at other times was
correspondent thereunto? No undoubtedly. Thus they did, and thus they died
themselves: and thus taught they their people to do, and to die. Yea thus were
our Ancestors here in England above five hundred years agone taught to prepare
themselves for death, by Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury, who then lived.
Among other Questions he wills that this be demanded of the sick man that
lies a dying; Credis and sper^^ venire ad salutem aeternam non tuis meritis
sed Christi? Dicat, Sic. Ansel. ut refertur in Tract. de Art moriendi Impress.
Bisuntij, Anno 1488.
Do thou believe and hope to be saved, or to come to life eternal, not by
thine own merits, but by Christ's? To which Question he advises the sick man
to say, yea. And then turning his speech to him by way of instruction and
exhortation; In sola Christi morte te totum contege: huic morti te involve. Et
si Dominus Deus te voluerit judicare, dic, Domine, morse^ Domini mei Jesus
Christi objicio inter te et me and judiciu^ tuu^; aliter tecum non co^tendo. Si
dixerit, quod mereris damnationem, dic, Mortem D. mei I.C. objicio inter te and
me et mala merita mea: ipsumque dignissi^^ passionis meritu^ offero pro merito,
quod ego habere debuissem, and (^eu) non habeo. Ibid.
Cover thy self, says he, all over with Christ's death, and wind up thy soul
in it. And if God offer to judge thee, say thou; Lord, I set the death of my
Lord Jesus Christ between me and thee, and thy judgment, and I will no
otherwise contend with thee. If he say, thou deservest damnation; say thou; I
set the death of my Lord Jesus Christ between thee and me and mine evil
deserts: And I tender the merits of his most worthy passion in stead of the
merit that I should have, but (alas) have not. This then was the Doctrine and
practice of those Ancient Fathers; and this it was that our Ancestors and
Forefathers were taught, contrary to that that the Church of Rome teaches and
maintains at this day. Yea this, that firebrand of the Christian world, Pope
Hildebrand made profession of, when he writ on this wise (as Baronius
reports of him) to the Abbot of Clugnie, Ita me gravatum propriae actionis
^od^re invenio, ut nulla romaneat spes saluti^, nisi de sola misericordia
Christi, Greg. PP. 7. in epist. ad Hug. Clunia^. apud Baron. tom. 11. An. 1075.
number. 7.
I find my self so depressed with the weight of mine own actions, that I
have no hope of safety left, but in the mercy of Christ alone.

But let us examine Bellarmines cautelous Conclusion a little.

1. Is this the surest and safest course, why condemn they us then as
Heretics for taking and teaching it? Why Index Expurg. H^span. In libro qui
inscribitur, Ordo baptizandi: Deleantur illa verba; Credis non* proprijs
meritis, sed Domini Christi virtute and merito ad gloriam pervenire? Index
Belg. ex Iac. Fabr. in Romans 4. dele; Tu, si sapis, neque in fide, neque in
operibus, sed in Deo confide. Et ex Comment. in Gal. 3. Qui confidit in
operibus in seipso confidit, and ^aculo nititur ^rundineo. Et ex Comment. in
Ephesians. 1. Quid igitur laudabimu^? Nu^quid nos, aut opera nostra, etc. Nequaquam.
cross they out of their own Writers such speeches as tend this way? Would
they not have men go the safer way? It is their Canonists rule, and their
Casuists common note, that In dubijs and ambiguis via tutior eligenda est:
Clemens 3. in Decretal. lib. 5. tit. 12. cap. 12. Gerson in Reg. Mor. Martin.
Navar. Enchirid. cap. 27.. 284.
The safest side, where any doubt may be, is to be held. And that much doubt
may be, yea must needs be here, himself tells us, when he teaches; that Non
possunt homines in hac vita habere certitudinem fidei de su^ justitia, nisi ex
speciali revelatione. Bellarmin. de Iustificat. lib. 3. cap. 3. Nemo absque
revelatione certo scire potest, se habere vera merita. Ibid. cap. 5. Hoc scire
impossible est, nisi ads^^ revelatio. Ibidem cap. 8.
Man's merits are ordinarily very uncertain; yea so uncertain, that without
special revelation a man can have no assured certainty of them. So that our
fault belike herein is only this then, that we are not so venturous, or
foole-hardie rather, as they are.

2. Is it a sure, yea the surest and safest course that can be, to trust in
Gods mercy alone? Then is Gods mercy alone belike able to save a man without
merits. For in vain were it to trust in it alone, if it alone were not
sufficient to save: according to that excellent saying of Bernard, speaking of
those words of the Psalmist; Psalm. ^7.40.
He will save them because they trust in him. He Salvabi^ eo^. quare? quibus
mer^t^? Audi quod sequitur; Quia sper^ver^nti^ eo. D^l^is causa; attamen
^fficax; attamen irrefr^^gab l^s. Nim^u^ ^ae^ est j^stitia, sed quae ex ^ide
est, non ex lege, Bern. in Psalm. 90. Sermon. 9. H^nc and A^gust. de verb. Ap. 7.
M* s^r^re mei. Quare? Quia virtut^m habeo, qua te promerear? quia voluntatis
arbi^rium gero, unde gr^tiam tuam meritum m^u^ praecedat? No^: quoniam in te
speravit anima mea. Psalm. 57.1.
will save them; says he: Why so? For what merits of theirs? Mark what
follows: Because they trust in him: A sweet cause, but effectual and
irrefragable. This is the righteousness indeed, not of the Law, but of Faith.
Hoc totu^ est hominis meritum, si totam spem pona^ in eo, qui totum hominem
salvum fecit. Bern. Idem ibid. Sermon. 15.
This is man's whole merit, that he set his whole hope on him, who has saved
the whole man. And, Haec est vera hominis fiducia, a se de^icientis, and
innite^tis Domino suo; ut non nisi in sola Dei misericordia respiret. Idem de
temp. 50.
This is man's true confidence, to fall from himself, and rest on his Lord,
refreshed in nothing but his mercy only. And elsewhere; Non est quod quaeras,
quibus meritis sp^remus bona. Sufficit ad meritum scire, quod merita non
sufficiant. Idem in Cant. 68.
No man need ask for what merits of ours we expect good things at Gods hands.
It is merit sufficient, to know, that no merit is sufficient. And again,
Meritum meum miseratio Domini. Ibid. ser. 61.
Gods mercy is my merit. Etsi mihi meritum deest, sed non illi miseratio. Ibid.
ser. 14.
Though I want merit, yet wants he no mercy. Non sum plan^ meriti in^ps,
quamdi^ ille miserationum non fuerit. Quodsi misericordiae Domini multae,
multus nihilominus ^go in meritis sum. Ibid. ser. 61.
Nor can I want store of merit, so long as he has store of mercy. Much merit
have I, since that he has so much mercy.

3. But why should they trust thus in Gods mercy alone? or why may they not
trust safely enough in their own merits also? For so his Assertion was, that
in them men might trust to; and that there was ground good enough for them so
for to do. Propter justitiae incertitudinem. Bellarm. ubi sup.
In regard, says he, of the uncertainty of a man's own righteousness: Quia
multi falluntur, dum puta^t se habere quod non habent. Idem de Iustific. l. 3.
c. 8.
because a man may be mistaken in it, and imagine that he has it, when he has
not. But certain or uncertain, how can man's merit be the ground of his
salvation, if his salvation depend upon Gods mercy alone? Or how is Man's merit
necessarily required unto salvation, if by Gods mercy alone he may be saved
without it?

4. Propter periculu^ inanis gloriae* Idem ubi sup.
In regard also, says he, of the Ieapordie of vainglory. In which clause
he acknowledges that this their Doctrine of man's merit is a dangerous
doctrine, (as Bernard also terms Stultum and periculosum est suis que^quam
confidere meritis, Bern. de Diverse. 32.

Periculosa habitatio eorum, qui in meritis suis spera^t; periculosa quia
ruinosa. Idem in Psalm. 90. Sermon. 1.


the practice of it both foolish and perilous) and such as may soon puff up
men's minds with vainglory, yea Discamus de nostra o^^ino industria, magis
autem de nostris diffidere meritis, Bern. de Temp. 75. Nam si^i quidem ipsi
fidere, non fidei, sed perfidiae est: nec confidentiae, sed diffidentiae magi^

humilitas cordis, ut ^on sibi ^ideli^ anima i^^itatur, sed des^r^ns semet

with pride and presumption, (he might well have said) the very bane of all
true confidence, grace, goodness and godliness. And consequently as a most
dreadful De Pharisaeo Chrysostom. t^m. 8. Se^. 14. (...).
rock threatening ship-wracke of salvation, to be most warily shunned and
eschewed of all those that are jealous of miscarying, and desirous of eternal
well-doing.

I will add here but the Confession of one or two of their own Writers: Ego
prorsus ^xistim^^i^ and Christian^ (...), quod (...), unquam restabili quae
sustentatu^, justitia Christi nobi^ (...) and gratia (...). Co^taren. (...)
Justific.
I am wholly of this mind (says Cardinal Contarene) that it is a pious and a
Christian-like saying, that we ought to rely, as on a thing steadfast and able
to support us, on Christ's righteousness bestowed upon us, not on holiness or
grace inherent in us. On this alone, as certain and steadfast ought we to
rest. And Summo consensu veteres omnes trad^nt, fiduciam remissionis peccatoru^
etia^ little quae post regeneration^m admittuntur; and sp^ veniae and vitae
eternae, in sola Dei misericordia and merito Christiess^ coll^candam, Cassa^d*
Consult. art. 6.
All the Ancients with general consent, says Cassander, deliver, that
confidence for remission of sins, and hope of pardon and life eternal, is to
be placed in Gods mercy alone and Christ's merits. To which purpose also he
alleges a place of Pope Gregory, to this effect; Non in fletibus and actibus
nostris, sed in Advocati nostri allegatione confidimus, Greg. in Ezech. hom. 1.
We trust not in our own tears or deeds, but in our Advocates plea. And as
for trust in ought else, says Adrian of Vtrech, who was Bishop of Rome also
afterward; Sunt merita nostra veluti baculus arundineus; cui du^ quis innixus
fuerit, confringitur, et perforat ^anum innitentis, Adrian. de Traject. in 4.
Sent.
Our merits are but as a staff of reed, which if a man lean to or rely on, it
knappeth asunder, and runs through his hand that relieth on it. It is the
surest course, says Bellarmine; it is the only sure course, say we, to trust
only in Gods mercy. So said the Ancients before us (as some of their own,
you see confess) with us. And to teach men in stead of it to trust in their
own merits, is to teach them Bain. spirit. Armor.
to exchange a rock for a reed. Nor can there be any safety at all in so
doing; unless it be safe to rely on so deceitful and dangerous a stay as is
sure to serve them all (by their own Adrians confession) that trust thereunto,
as Esai. 36.6.
Rabsake says Egypt did, as (...)* Plu. Apophth.
the Spartan said Athens would have done, if Greece should have relied on it.

Thus then, sometime they seek to salve and qualify this their pestilent and
poisonfull Doctrine, which at other times, as not half, but wholly ashamed to
own it, they do utterly deny and disclaim.

It is Octavum Philippi Mendacium. In art. 20. Confess. Iube^t Catholici
Doctores mereri remissionem peccatorum operibus, Bellar. in Indic. de Libr.
Concord.
Philips Melanchthons eighth Lie, says Bellarmine, that our Teachers will men
to merit remission of sins by their works. These words I find not at all in
the place out of which they are alleged. Neither know I what Edition of that
Confession he follows. But suppose that Philip say so. Why, is it a Lie? Is
it not true that they teach so? Yes doubtless. Bellarmine himself elsewhere
confesses, that Andr. Vega l. 13. in Council. Trident. c. 36. contendit,
satis^ieri pro culpa. Bellar. de poenit. l. 4. c. 1.
some of their Doctors teach, that men by their own works make satisfaction
to God for the fault or offense it self. Others, Docet Rua^d. Tapper. insignis
Theologus in explic. art. 6. Lovan. posse hominem satisfacere Deo pro culpa and
poena aeterna per actus quosdam, etc. Bellarm. ibid.
that they satisfy both for the fault or offense, and for the punishment also,
yea even the eternal pains thereunto due: Others again (whom he gives his
voice with) Nos Council. Trid. Sess. 6. c. 14. and Sess. 14. c. 13. sequentes,
Per opera poenalia vere ac proprie Domino satisfieri pro reatu poenae, qui post
culpa^ dimissam remanet expiandus. Idem ibid. l. 4. c. 7.
not for the fault it self indeed, but for the guilt of such penalties as
remain due for the same, after that the fault is forgiven, Id est, pro poena
sensus, ut Cajetan. recte de Co^trit. q. 4. quam in Gehenna pati debuisset
peccator, remota solum aeternitate. Ib. c. 1.
that is, says he, for the pains that a sinner should in hell else have
suffered, the eternity of them only taken away: that which he terms out of
some Prove. 16.6. Dan. 4.24.
places of Scripture both Nam redimendi verbum n^utrobique reperitur.
mis-translated, and Vise Iun. in utrumque: Et Baium infra.
mis-expounded, Bellar. ibid. l. 4. c. 8.
a redeeming or buying out of men's sins; and maintains Idem ibid. l. 2. c.
12. and l. 4. c. 8.
remission of sins to be by such redemption purchased and procured.

Again, that Apertissime agnoscit satisfactionem condigna^ esse debere, and
eam proportionem cum peccato exigere, ut vere per eam offensio compensetur, de
Poenit. l. 4. c. 9.
men by their works make such condign satisfaction for some sins, Vt
injuria Deo facta compensetur, and divinae justitiae sat^s^iat, Ibid.
that thereby the offense and wrong done to God is truly recompensed, and his
justice fully satisfied; and that Accedente gratia vere possumus aliquo modo ex
operibus proprijs Deo indebitis, et ad aequalitatem, ac per hoc just et ex
condigno satisfacere, Ib. c. 7.
through Gods grace they do in some sort by works of their own, which they
owe not to God, truly or equally, and therefore justly also and condignely
satisfy; for that Quia quatenus a spiritu procedu^t, habent quandam
infinitatem, ac per hoc aequalitatem cum injuria, qua Deum peccando
afficiebamus, Ibid.
such works have a kind of infiniteness (or infinite worth) in them, and
consequently an equality with the wrong, that they did God by their sins, in
sundry places he himself avoweth: which what is it but to merit remission of
sins? For has not he merited remission that has made such satisfaction?

Yea the Objection being made, that then Vel sunt duae satisfactiones simul
junctae, una Christi, altera nostra; vel una ta^tum. Si duae, ergo bis punitur
eadem culpa. Si una tantum, vel illa est Christi, and tunc nos non
satisfacimus; vel nostra, and tunc excluditur Christus; aut vere di^idemus cum
Christo honore^, nam ille s^lvet pro culpa, nos pro poena, Bellar. de Purgat.
l. 1. c. 14.
either there must be two joint satisfactions, the one Christ's, and the other
ours; or but one only; and that either Christ's, and then we do not satisfy;
or ours, and then Christ's is excluded; or else we divide the honor between
Christ and our selves, that he pay for the fault, and we for the punishment:
The Cardinal says, that hereunto three Answers are given.

For 1. some say Quidam asserunt esse unam tantum, and illa^ Christi esse; ac
nos proprie non satisfacere, sed solum facere aliquid, cujus intuitu Deus
applicat nobis Christi satisfactionem. Ita Michael Baius de Indulg. cap. ult.
that there is one only satisfaction, and that is Christ's: and that we, to
speak properly, do not satisfy at all, but only do somewhat in regard
whereof God applies Christ's satisfaction to us: And Quod est dicere, Nostra
opera non esse nisi conditiones, sine quibus non applicaretur nobis Christi
satisfactio, vel ad summum, esse dispositiones.
so, says he, should our works be nothing but conditions, or dispositions
at most, without which Christ's satisfaction should not be applied to us. That
which is indeed in effect the same that we say. But Quae sente^tia erronea mihi
videtur, Bellarm. ibid.
this he holds to be erronius.

2. Some say, that Alij dicunt quod sunt duae, sed una ab altera dependens.
there are two satisfactions, but the one depending upon the other; the one
Christ's, and the other ours: Nam etia^si una sufficiat, tamen ad majorem
gloriam Dei, cui satis fit, and majorem honorem hominis satisfacientis, placuit
Christo conjungere nostram.
for though the one were sufficient; yet for greater honor to us, God will
have ours added to his. And Qui modus non videtur mihi improbabilis, Bell. ibid.
this he holds to be not improbable.

3. Some say, and Tertius modus videtur probabilior; quod una tantu^ sit
actualis satisfactio, et ea sit nostra, Bellar. ibid.
that is the more probable, (and that therefore he goes with) that there is
but one actual satisfaction alone, and that ours. Et tunc Christus excluditur.
And so Christ consequently is excluded, and shut out at doors, as in the
Objection before was said. Yea he says moreover, that as Non erit absurdu^ si
Sancti viri Redemptores nostri esse dicantur, cum aliquo modo passionibus suis
delicta nostra possint redimere. Bellarm. de Indulg. l. 1. c. 4.
the Saints may well be termed our redeemers, because that by their sufferings
they may redeem or buy out our sins: So Homo sui ipsius Redemptor and
Salvator appellatur: nec propterea ulla fit Christo injuria. Idem de Purgat.
lib. 1. cap. 14.
a man may well be said to be his own Redeemer and Savior, and yet no wrong
therein done to Christ, when by his own works Condign satisfacit. Ibid. cap.
13.
he makes condign satisfaction to God in this manner for his sins.

And now judge you, whether Philip Melanchthon lied or no, when he said (if at
least he did so say) that they will men to merit remission of their sins by
their works. But let us hear further how not Melanchthon, but Bellarmine
lies himself, where he charge Melancthon with lying. Non id habet
Catholica doctrina ut operibus illis, quae fiunt sine fide and auxilio Dei
gratuito mereri possint homines remissionem peccatorum. Bellar. in Jndic. de
lib. Concord. Mendac. 8.
We teach not, says he, that by works done without faith or Gods free
help, men may merit remission of sins. Huc accedit, quod istis etiam
operibus, quae fiunt ex fide et auxilio Dei, non tale tribuimus meritum, ut ei
respo^deat ex justitia merces; sed meritum solum impetrationis, ut Augustinus
loquitur, quod Scholastici meritum de congruo, non de co^digno nominare solent.
Bellar. ibid.
Nor do we ascribe even unto those works that are done of Faith and by Gods
aid, such a merit, as that the reward does of justice or right answer it; (that
is, the merit of condignitie) but the merit of impetration only, as. Augustine
speaks; which the Schoolmen are wont to call not the merit of condignitie,
but the merit of congruitie. Neque in hoc ulla est inter Catholicos
differentia, ibid.
Nor is there any dissent among Catholics herein.

I might here take occasion to show somewhat largely, in what sense the Ita
Hieron. in Hosh. 4.14. Grandis offensa, postqua^ peccaveris, ira^ Dei non
mereri. Christi esse meruisti. Collatio Carth. cognit. 1. art. 8. Proponant,
qui ista elicere meruerunt. Ibid. cognit. 3. art. 16. Quis supplicavit, quis
legem meruit? Quis judicium postulavit? Et Sedul. and alius nescio quis Hieron.
nomine in Romans 4. Magna beatitudo est sine labor legis and poenitentiae,
Domini gratiam sola fide promereri; sicut siquis aliquam dignitatem gratis
accipiat.
Ancient Fathers, as also Pacem sub hac lege meruit, ut captivos nostros
redderet. Ammian. hist. lib. 17. Pacem quam ipse meruit, ei quoque debere
proficere, Ibid.
other Writers of those times do ordinarily use the word to Merit (because our
Adversaries so much press the use of that Phrase in them, as if it implied
such Merit as they mantaine) to wit, as Augustinus explicat quomodo fides
mereatur, cum dicit eam impetrare remissionem peccatorum. Bellar. de Iustif.
lib. 1. cap. 21. Sed and Bellarm. ipse ibid. l^b. 5. cap. 2. exponit illud
Vulg. versionis Hebr. 13.16. Talibus hostijs Deus promeretur, i. ut Oecumenius,
placetur Deo.
Bellarmine himself, with Qu^dsi aliquis veterum vocabulo promerendi usus est,
non aliter intellexit, quam consecutionem de facto. Stapleton. prompt. Fer. 5.
post Passion. Dominic. Videatur Vega infra.
others of his own side also acknowledges, for to atchieve or obtain ought
on any terms whatsoever, be it of free favor, or of due debt and desert:
which is the Merit of Impetration, that he says Augustine speaks of; and
Multum interest inter meritum and impetrationem, Bell. de Bon. oper. in
particul. l. 1. c 9.
differs much from Merit or Desert strictly and properly so termed, as
Bellarmine himself also grants: Since that, by their own confession,
Jmpetramus etiam quae non meremur. Tho. sum par. 1a. 2 ae. q. 114. a. 9. A man
may impetrate, and not deserve: and a man may deserve and not impetrate,
Anonymus Author co^tra Bellij Ruinam Papismi. Meritum enim innititur justitiae;
and non potest Deus homini negare quod meruit, etc. Sed impetrare est
liberalitatis divinae: si det, est gratiae; si non det, non potest ^rgui
injustitiae. Adrian. quod lib. q 8.
it is one thing to impetrate or obtain, and another to merit, that is, to
deserve: And therefore in such sense as they use the word Merit, Veniam
Arbitione precante meruerunt. Ammian. hist. l. 15. Quia Dei filium Judea
contempsit, Gentilitas promeruit. Greg. in 1 Reg. 2. Maria sola ma^er Domini
fieri meruit. Eusebij Emiss. nomine in Dominic. 4. Advent. Pare^e meruit eum,
quem constat nullum habtisse peccatum. August. de Not. and Great. cap. 36. Ipsum
Deum homin^m factum and concipere and parere, non humanis meritis, sed concepti
nascentisque ex ea summi Dei dignatione promeruit. Fulgent. de Great. and
Incarn. cap. 7. Laetiores interim quod virgas evaserint, quam quod meruerint
principatum, Bernardus De pueris ad praelaturam promotis, Epist. 42. Itaque
ingenue Vega de Justificat. lib. 8. cap. 8. agnoscit, usurpari apud Patres
nomen Meriti, ubi nulla est ratio Meriti, neque de congruo, neque de condigno.
a man may be said sometime to merit, that is, obtain and impetrate, what he
deserves not; and again, Miles Gallicanis sudoribus nec donatioum meruit, nec
stipendium. Ammian. histor. lib. 17.
not to merit, that is, obtain and impetrate what yet he has well deserved.
As also in this sense Sol^n^ meritum appellare quemlibet actum bonum, ratione
cujus aliquid aliud accipimus: ut ex Augustin^ perspicu^ patet, Bellarm. de
Great. and lib. Arb. lib. 1. cap. 14.
they are wont (Bellarmine himself also acknowledging it) to call all good
works merits, for which we receive ought, though the reward be, as Mercedem
quandam esse dicimus, quae magis debetur ex gratia, quam ex justitia; sive quae
imputetur sec. gratiam, and non sec. debitum* Idem de Iustific. lib. 1. cap. 21.
he grants also that it may be, not of desert, right, or due debt, but of
favor and grace only. Wherein Bernard singularly well expounding their
meaning, and his own too, where he uses those and the like terms; Si
proprie appellentur ea quae dicimus merita nostra, spei quaedam sunt seminaria,
charitatis incentiva, occultae pr^destinationis indicia, futurae
glorificationis praes^gia, via regni, non causa regnandi, Bern. de Great. and
lib. arb.
If we speak properly, says he, those things that we use to call merits,
are certain seeds of Hope, sparks of Love, signs of our hidden
predestination, presages of our future glorification; the way to the crown,
not the cause of our crowning.

I might also insist on that which Bellarmine has elsewhere, that Quod nos
dicimus mereri, Graeci dicun^ (...), Bellarm. de Iustifi^. l. 5. c. 2.
to merit, as they speak, is no more than that which the Greeks call (...),
which word signifies not (...). i. dignum esse. Ide^ ibid.
to be worthy, as he says, contrary to all use and authority, but (...),
Schol. Thucyd. (...), Suid* (...) Schol. Sophocl.
to be vouchsafed, reputed or esteemed as worthy, as also Non ait, ut digni
sitis, s^d ut digni habeamini, Cajetan. in 2 Thessalonians. 1.5.
Cajetan himself, therein following their own vulgar Latin, expounds it.
And whereas that same their vulgar Translation has it in bad and barbarous
Talibus hostijs promeretur Deus, Hebr. 13.
Latin, and their Rhemists version in as bad or worse English, Rh^mens. Hebr.
13.
with such hosts God is promerited. Sensus est, tali^us hostijs delectatur,
sive placatur D^us, ut hab^t co^mentarius Chrysostomi: vel t^libus hostijs
pl^cetur Deo, ut exponit Oecumenius, Bellar. de Iustific. l. 5. c. 2.
The meaning of it is, says Bellarmine* that with such sacrifices God is
delighted, or pacified, as Chrysostomes Commentary has it, (though indeed in
Chrysostomes Co^mentarie, there no is such word, or any one word of exposition,
but the same word it self only) or is pleased, (well-pleased, it is word for
word in the Original) as Oecumenius expounds it. And Significat Deum
delectari bonis, ^isque concilia^i, and induci ad benefaciendum ijs qui ben^
operantur, Ibid.
it signifies, says he, that God is delighted in good works, and is
therewith conciliated, (that is, moved to befriend, as we say) and induced
thereby to do good unto those that do well. Which is that that we mean,
when we say that works are meritorous. Well it were indeed if they either
meant or main-maintained no no more than is here said. Little controversy
would there then be between us and them.

But to let these things pass, lest I be in this point overlong. Do all
Catholics deny indeed even to works done of faith and grace all merit of
condignitie? And is there no difference at all among them herein? Yea does not
Bellarmine himself maintain the Imo, dignari, ut Cic. de Orat. l. 3.
^o^trary? Or does he not know that there is difference among them herein? and
that the most of them (of later times especially) go the other way? Yes
undoubtedly. But he deals herein, as he does in the point of Adoration of
Images. It is a Imagines coli eodem cultu cu^ Proto^ypo, sive quo coluntur,
quorum sunt imagines; Christi and Dei latria: est opinio co^muni Theologorum
sententia recepta. Sic Thom. Albert. Palud. Almain. Marsil Maiol. Capreol.
Cajetan. and caeteri juniores. Azor. institut. l. 8. c 6. et Greg. de Valent.
de Jdolatr. l. 2. c. 6.
common tenent among them, that Images are to be worshipped with the self same
worship that those are worshipped with, whose Images they are: and so
consequently the Images of God and Christ with divine worship* And Bellarmine
himself, though a little qualifying it, both allows and defends it, Si de
reipsa agatur, admitti potest Imagines posse coli improprie vel per accidens,
eodem genere cultus, quo exemplar ipsum colitur, etc. Bellar. de cult Sanct. l.
2. c. 23.
that by accident, or improperly they may be and are so worshipped; to wit,
either Qua^do imago accipitur pro ipso exemplari, cujus vicem gerit, Ibid.
as those Images are Gods or Christ's Deputies, and so receive for God or Christ
himself the worship due to either; or Cum exemplar co^sideramus quasi im^gine
vestitum, etc. Ibid.
as men conceive God or Christ clad in that Image, as a King in his Roabes, and
so worship the Image in the same worship together with either. But yet, says
he, Quantu^ ad modum loquendi, praesertim in concione ad populum, non est
dicendum imagines ullas adora^i debere latria; s^d ^ contrari^, non deb^re sic
ado^ari^ Bellar^. ibid. cap. 22.
you must not in any wise tell the people so in the Pulpit, that any Images are
to be worshipped with divine worship; but the contrary rather, that they are
nor to be worshipped. And why so? Forsooth* Offendit aur^^ Catholicorum.
because many good Catholics cannot endure to hear that Images should be
adored: and again, Praebet occasione^ haereticis liberius blasphemandi, Ibid.
Because it gives Heretics occasion to speak more freely evil of them.

And in like manner deals he in this matter of Merit. Because our Writers
justly tax them for extreme arrogance therein: Bellarmine here flatly denies
it, and says that none of them maintain it, and we do but belly them in
charging them with it. And yet, to pass by what before was alleged out of
him; and what he says elsewhere again, that Remissio veni^li^m justo Dei
judicio redditur bonis meritis justorum. Bellarm. de Just. sic. l. 1. c. 21.
the remission of some sins is even in justice due to man's good Merits; Where
professedly he handles the Controversy concerning the merits of man's works,
he concludes the direct contrary to what here he avoweth, and condemns what
he averreth here, as no better than Heresy.

The very Title of his Discourse is, Opera justorum ex charitate facta esse
meritoria vitae aeternae ex condigno. Bellar. de Iustif. l. 5. c. 16.
That men's works done of charity do condignely merit or deserve Life
eternal; and that, Non solum ratione pacti, sed etiam ration^ operu^, Ibid.
cap. 17.
not only in regard of Gods Covenant, but in regard of the works themselves.

In the Discourse it self he tells us, that Catholici omnes ag^oscunt,
opera bona justoru^ esse meritoria vitae aeternae, Ibid. c. 16.
All Catholics hold that they merit Life eternal. That Aliqui ^ensent non
esse utendum vocibus his de condigno and de congruo. Sed absolute esse
dic^ndum, Opera justorum esse and meritoria vitae aeternae ex gratia Dei. Ita
Tho. Wald^ns. de Sacram. tom. 3. c. 7. and Paul* Burg. addit. ad Lyr. in Psalm.
35.
some of them indeed would have no mention made either of condignitie or
congruitie; Alij volunt esse meritoria de condigno largo modo, quod respectu
condigni proprie sumpti dicatur congruu^, respectu co^grui possi^ dici
condignum. Ita Durand. in 2. Sent. d. 27. q 2. Et Greg. Arimin. in 1. Sent. d.
17. q. 1. art. 2.
Some go a middle way between congruitie and condignitie; and Quidam
distinguunt inter dignu^ and condignum, and meritum ex digno admittunt, non ex
condigno.
some again would distinguish between dignity and congruitie. But that
Communis sente^tia* Theologoru^ admittit simpliciter meritum de condigno.
Bellarm. ibid.
the common opinion of their Divines admits merit of condignitie: which he
also concludes with.

Again he says that Quidam existi^nant opera bona no^ esse meritoria vitae
aeternae ex condigno ratione operis, sed tantum ratione pacti, and
acceptationis divinae, Bellar. de Iustific. l. 5. c. 17.
some of their Divines hold, that Quidam existimant opera bona no^ esse
meritoria vitae aeternae ex condigno ratione pacti, and acceptationis divinae,
Bellar. de Iustifi^. l. 5. c. 17.
such works do not merit life eternal condignely, in regard of the work it
self, or the worth of it, but in regard of Gods Covenant and his acceptance
of them only; And that Ita Scot. in 1. Sent. d. 17. qu. 2. quem al^j quoque ex
veteribus scholasticis sequuntur.
thus only the Ancient Schoolmen held. Non desunt qui censent esse meritoria
ex condigno ratione operis, etiamsi nulla extaret divina conventio. Ita
Cajetan. in Thom. p. 1^.2^. q. 114. a. 1. and Dominic. a Soto de Not. and.
Great. c. 7.
Others, that they merit it condignely in regard of the work it self, and the
worth of it, albeit that God with man had made no such agreement at all. Nobis
media sententia probabilior videtur, esse sci^. meritoria ex co^digno ratione
pacti and operis simul, Bell. ibid.
He himself thinks best to go the middle way, as he says the Council of
Trent does; to wit, that they merit it condignely, in regard both of the
agreement and the work jointly together. And that we may not mistake his
meaning herein, he tells us further, that he does Non quod sine pacto and
acceptatione non habeat opus bonu^ proportionem ad vita^ aeternam ex operis
dignitate, Ibid.
not thus determine, as if he held, that such works did not in regard of the
dignity and worth of them well deserve life eternal, albeit no such agreement
were; but merit it in regard of Gods gracious acceptance only: Detrabitur de
gloria Christi, si merita nostra sint ita imperfecta, ut non sint meritoria ex
condigno, nisi ratione acceptationis Dei, Ibid.
for it were a disgrace to God, if his grace in us should be so poor and
imperfect as to merit no otherwise: (as the Lovaine Professors also, too base
and beggarly for us Absit ut justi vitam aeternam expectent sicut pauperes
^leemosynam, mult^ namque gloriosius est ipsos quasi victores and triumphatores
eam possidere, tanquam palmam suis sudoribus debitam. Ruard. Tapper. explic.
art. Lovan. tom. 2. cap. 9.
to crave it and have it as an alms:) and that they therefore deserve it,
because Ita ut in bono opere sit quaeda^ proportio and aequalitas ad praemium
vitae aeternae, Ibid.
there is a kind of proportion and equality; yea not Satis est proportionalis
aequalitas, Ibid. c. 18.
a proportionable only, but Modus futuri judicij erit sec. justitiam
commutativam, quoniam Deus non solum co^stituet proportionalem aequalitatem
inter merita and praemia, sed etiam absolutam aequalitatem inter opera and
mercedes, Ibid. cap. 14.
an absolute equality (for so he says in express terms elsewhere) between
the work and the wages: And that is properly merit of condignitie indeed, Vbi
opus est per se aequale mercedi, Ibid. l. 1. c. 21. vere par mercedi, Ibid. l.
5. c. 17.
when the work is equal of it self to the wages: which merit of condignitie
he says therefore is Meritum vere and proprie, Bellar. de poenit. l. 4. c. 8.
truly and properly, Simpliciter and absolute tale. Idem de justific. l. 5. c.
18.
simply and absolutely so termed; Meritum ex justitia and sec. debitum. Ibid.
l. 1. c. 21. Ex justo Dei judicio, Ibid. l. 5. c. 16.
Merit in Justice, or of right and due debt: which Meritum ex gratia magis quam
justitia: meritum imperfectum, Ibid. l. 1. c. 21. Meritum impetrationis tantum,
Ibid. and in Ind^c. de lib. concord. sup.
that other of congruitie is not. And such works therefore, say our Rhemists,
are Rhemens. in 2 Timothy 4.8.
truly and properly meritoriously, and fully worthy of everlasting life, so
that heaven is the due and just stipend or recompense, which God by his justice
owes to persons so working; and that I^dem in Hebr. 6.^^.
so far forth, that he should be unjust, if he should not render heaven
for the same: Albeit Damnatum Parisijs an. Dom. 1354. Fr. Guidonis enunciatum
hoc: Quod homo meretur vitam aeternam de condigno: quod si non daretur ei,
ficret injuria, and quod Deus faceret sibi injuriam. In Bibliothec. Patr. tom.
4. edit. 2.
that assertion was by the Divines of Paris almost 300. years since condemned
as false and heretical; and by Durandus, says Bellarmine himself, Temerarium
and blasphemum esse dicere, Deum fore injustum si meritis hominum justorum non
reddat mercedem, etc. Ex Durando Bellarm. de Iustific. l. 5. c. 16. Vide
Durandum in 2. Sent. d. 27. q. 2. Nam quod Bellarm. promissam, addit, de suo
^st.
it is censured (and that not unjustly) not as bold only, but as blasphemous.

But why is Gods agreement needful then? or why does Bellarmine require that
also? He tells you himself; not for any defect or want of worth in the
work, but Requiritur pactu^ and conventio: nisi enim id praecesserit, non
potest ex justitia commutativa, neque ex distributiva etiam, opus alterum
oblig^re, quantumvis eximium sit, and aequale mercedi, Idem de Iustific. l. 5.
c. 14.
because that without some such agreement no reward or wages can of right be
claimed for any work, albeit of it self otherwise it be never so worthy.

Lastly, he tells us that Non defunt gravissimi Autores, qui sentiant, Omne
opus bonum hominis justi and habitu charitatis praediti, vitae ^tern^
meritoriu^ esse, (...). c. 15.
there want not very grave Authors, who think that every good work of a just
man endued with charity meriteth or deserves life eternal. Probabilius
videtur ad meritum exigi, ut opus bonu^, vel tunc cu^ fit, actu imperetur a
charitate, atque in Deum ut finem ultimum referatur; vel certe nascatur ab actu
imperato a charitate, atque in Deum ante relato; quod est virtute non actu
(...) Deu^ referri, Ibid.
Which he thus far forth also subscribeth unto, if this condition be added,
that not only the parti^ doing it be endued with charity, but the very work
it self also do actually, or virtually at least pr^ceede from charity, and
be done for Gods sake. So that not only the whole course and tenor of a godly
man's life uprightly and religiously led, being laid altogether in one lump,
but every particular such action of it, considered alone by it self, should by
this their doctrine deserve no less than heaven at Gods hands. And then belike
so often as they have done any good work merely for Gods sake, so often have they
deserved an heaven at least of him. It were absurd and senseless for a sorry
beggar to imagine (that I may use Bellarmines own comparison) that by weeding
though a whole day in the Kings garden at White Hall, he had in regard of the
worth of the work done by him, deserved an hundred Iacobusses, because his
Majesty had promised for his days work to give him such wages. Si opus
aliquod sit multo inferius mercede ex conventione promissa, ut si Dominus
vineae co^duceret operarios, and no^ denarium diurnum, sed centum nummos aureos
pro mercede promitteret, non esset meritum ex condigno ratione operis, Bellar.
de Iustific. l. 5. c. 17.
Bellarmine himself will not deny it. But it were much more absurd for such an
one to imagine, that for every weed that in that his days work he had pulled
up (were it done out of never so much love to his Sovereign) he had deserved,
I say not an Earldom, or a Dukedom, but a Crown at least or a Kingdom. And
yet is there far greater disproportion here between the work that we do,
and the reward that we expect, than could there be between the work and the
wages: Since that Finiti ad infinitum nulla est proportio. Itaque recte
Fulgent. ad M^nim. l. 1. Tantum ibi gratia divinae retributionis exuberat, ut
inco^parabiliter atque ineffabiliter omne meritum quamvis bonae and ex Deo
datae humanae voluntatis and operationis excedat.
between finite and infinite there is no proportion at all. And therefore
says our Countryman Thomas of Walden, though no friend to Wickliffe; for he
wrote professedly against him; Quid dignu^ facimus ut participes coelestibus
fieri inveniamur? etc. Thom. Wald. citante Vega de merit. q. 4.
What can we do that should be worthy of heavenly things, which the Apostle
says, that Romans 8.18.
The sufferings of this life are not worthy of? Reputo igitur sauiorem
Theologum, fideliorem Catholicum, and Script. sanctis magis concordem, qui tale
Meritum simpliciter abnegat, Idem ibid.
I account him therefore the sounder Divine, the better Catholic, (and the
Protestants belike then are the better Catholics herein) and one that agrees
more with Gods word, that simply and utterly denies such Merit. Totis licet
animae and corporis laboribus desudemus, totis licet obedi^n^i^ viribus
exerceamur, nihil tamen condignum merito pro coelestibus bonis compensare and
offerre valebimus, Eusebius. Emiss. nomine, homil. 3. ad Monarch.
And though a man, says an uncertain Author, but alleged commonly by them,
as Eusebius Emissenus, should with all the strength of body and mind exercise
himself to the utmost, in obedience to God all his life long, yet could he
bring out nothing, that by way of condign merit could countervaile heavens
happiness. For, considering the extent and continuance of it, Quanto labor
digna est requies quae non habet finem? Si verum vis computare and verum
judicare; aeterna requies aeterno labor recte emitur. Sed noli timere:
miseric^rs est Deus, Aug. in Psalm. 93.
if we cast our reckonings up aright, says Augustine, it should be eternal
travel at least, that should purchase eternal rest. And considering the
dignity and excellency of it, Si h^mo mill annis serviret Deo etiam
ferventissime, no^ meretur ex co^digno dimidiam die^ esse in regno caelorum,
Anselm. de Mensur. cruc. c. 2.
Though a man, says Anselme, should serve God in most fervent manner for a
thousand years together, yet should he not thereby condignely merit to be but
half a day im heaven. And (...), Chrysostom. in Matthew. hom* 79.
though the godly have done a whole million of good deeds, says Chrysostom. yet
that such a crown, such an heaven, and so great honor should for so small
pidling matters (in comparison thereof) be conferred on them, it is of Gods
free grace, and (as he there also implies) not of due debt, or of their
desert. For, (...), idem ibid.
It is of justice, says he, that the other are punished; it is of grace that
these are crowned, that is, there is Non tibi reddit debitam poenam, sed donat
indebita^ gratia^, Aug. in Psa. 31.
deserved pain* as Augustine speaks, repaid the one, grace undeserved freely
bestowed on the other. Anselme, it seems, thought he could not in an hundred,
nay in a thousand years, do that* that they are able to do in less than a^
hour. He thought and taught that a man could not in a thousand years, by all
that ever he did, or could do, merit half a days abode in heaven; and they
think and ^each (if they think at least as they teach) that a man may in much
less than half a days space do that, that shall merit more than a thousand
thousand years, even an eternal abode in heaven. Chrysostom thought a man
could not with a million of good works do that, that they think they can do
with any one alone. For, so many thousands of them, says he, cannot in justice
deserve the Kingdom of Heaven. Any one alone, say they, of those that we do,
can do it. Jacob deemed himself unable with all that he had done or could
do, to requite those favors, even in his temporal estate, that God had
conferred upon him: These men hold that they can by some one good deed of
theirs alone, not requite God only for what they have already received of
him, (for Facilius and minus est reddere aequivale^s ejus quod quis accepit ab
alio, qua^ eum constituere debitorem: quia ad constituendum eum debitorem
requiritur quod plus reddat quam acceperit, ut sic ratione plurium alius
efficiatur debtor, Durand. in 2. Sent. d. 27. q. 2.
that must be done first, Etsi proximo forte videatur quis reddere plus quam
debeat; Deo tamen nemo unquam reddit quod debet. Ber. de Diverse. 36. Et hinc
Thom. Bradward. de Cause. Dei, l. 1. c. 39. Nullus potest reddere plenarie

condigno.
which no man indeed can do, ere they can merit ought at his hands) but engage
him also to do further deservedly for them, even to the conferring of life
eternal, and celestial glory on them.

Thus we have seen, both what they hold, howsoever they seem sometime ashamed
of it, and therefore one while deny, what another while they affirm: As also
how contrary their presumptuous conceits and positions in this kind are to the
humble confessions and acknowledgements of Gods sincere Servants, as well
recorded in the Word, as reported elsewhere, yea Vide supra ex Bellarm. de
Iustific. l. 5. c. 7.

with whatsoever he shall please to confer on us, and afford us, or
whatsoever he shall think fit to call us unto; considering that we are not
worthy of ought, but unworthy wholly of whatsoever we have, be it more or
less. And if we be unworthie of what we have, be it never so little; then have
we more than we are worthy of, even when we have least: And if we have more
than we are worthy of; then have we no cause to repine, murmr, grow
discontent, or complain, if we have not so much as such and such have; if we
cannot go, or fare as such and such do; if we have not so good trading, or
our houses so well furnished, our wives and children so apparelled, as such and
such have.

cast our eyes home-ward, and consider our selves, and our own unworthiness
of ought, we might soon see how little cause we have to be discontent in
such cases. For have we but little leaft? It is more than we deserve. Has God
taken much from us? he might well have took more. As Anytus, a Gentleman of
Athens, told his guests that were at table with him, when Alcibiades a young
Gallant came in a revelling humor and took away the one half of his plate
that stood either for show or service upon the cupboard, and they marvelled
much at it, that Anytus could so take it, affirming that he had dealt very

us half, when he might have took all: for it was all his, or at his command.
So it is here indeed. He takes part, that Act. 17.25. 1 Timothy 6.17.
gave all; and that might therefore as well take all as part; because 1 Chronicles.

This is good too, and this too, and this too, and this too, etc. And in like
manner may we well say, how little soever be leaft us, This is more than I am
worthy of, and this too, and this too, etc. If God shall again and again
too, never so often, impair our estates, and by peece-meale withdraw from us

making good what he had promised.

it is all of mere mercy.

Unworthy of all thy Mercies; says Jacob. And, Psalm. 103.4.
who Coronat te. Vulg. and Vatabl. quia (...) corona. Vnde Aug. de verb. Ap. 2.
Post redemptionem ab omni corruptione quid restat nisi corona justitia? Ipsa
cer^e restat; sed eliam sub ipsa vel in ipsa non sit caput turgidum, ut
recipiat corona^. Dicturus erat, Coronat me; merita mea fatetur, etc. debitu^
redditur non donatu^. Audi, etc. De misericordia te coronat, de miseratione te
coronat. Non enim dignus fuisti qu^m vocaret, and vocatum justificaret, and
justificatum glorifica^^t. Et de sp. and lit. cap. 33. Hoc fiet in judicio, ubi
necessarium suit commemorare miseric. and miserat. Vbi jam exigi d^bita and
reddi merita si possent videri, ut nullus esset misericordiae locus. Necessaria
itaque est nobis Salvatoris misericordia, sive cum convertimur, sive cum
praeliamur, sive cum coronamur. Idem de Corrept. and Great. cap. 13.
crowns, or Cingit, vel circumtegit, Iun. (...) sicut Psalm. 5.12.
Benevolentia tua^ tanquam umbone circumteges eum.
invironeth thee rather, with mercy; says the Psalmist: and Psalm. 103.10.
does not deal with thee according to thy deserts. Nam si secundum merita tibi
daret, damnaret (...), August. in Psalm. 102. Si quod debetur redderet, utique
damnaret. Idem in Psalm. 31. Si vellet pro meritis agere, non inveniret, nisi
quod damnaret. Idem in Psalm. 94.
For if he should so do, he should damn thee; says Augustine. And, Psalm.
32.10.
who so trusts in the Lord, mercy shall (...)
encompasse him on every side; says David.

Confirmation.
Now this point, that all that we either receive or expect is of Gods mercy,
howsoever it be by the former consideration sufficiently confirmed. For Vise
August. supr. de verb. Ap. Sermon. 2.
if we be not worthy of ought, then is nothing of merit. And if nothing of
merit, then all consequently of mercy.

Considerations 2.
Yet consider we for the further proof of it these two things; The manner of
Gods promises, and The prayers of Gods Saints.


Consider. 1. Gods Promises.
First, the Promises of God run all upon Mercy. Exodus 2^.6* and 34.7. Deuteronomy. 5.10.
Showing mercy to thousands, with them that love him, and keep his
commandments. And, Luke 1.50.
His mercy is for ever and ever on those that fear him; Psa. 103.17, 18.
and keep covenants with him, and think upon his commandments to do them.
And, Malac. 3.17.
I will spare them (and there is mercy then) that fear me, and think on my
Name, as a man spares his Son that serves him. Iam. 2.13. Misericordiam qui
non praestat alt^ri, ^ollit sibi. Chrysol. ser. 42.
There shall be judgment without mercy to those that show no mercy. And, In
illo j^dicio, in quo j^st^ coronantur, et injus^i damnan^ur, alij cu^
misericordia, alij sine miseri^. j^dicandi. Nam cum d^cit, Iud^cium erit sine
miseric. jis qui non fecerunt misericord a^ manifestatur in his, i^ quibus
inveniuntur bona opera misericordiae j^dicium cum misericordi^ fi^ri, a^ per
hoc ipsam etiam misericord^a^ meritis bonorum operum reddi, Aug. de Corrept. et
Great. cap. 13.
If without mercy to those that show no mercy; then with mercy even to those
also that show mercy; says Augustine. Yea so says our Savior himself;
Matthew. 5.7.
Blessed are the merciful; for they shall have mercy showed them. And, Romans
6.23.
The grace of God is ( Sicut Joan. 12.50. and 17.3. Quod and Piscator observat.
that is, brings) life eternal; says the Apostle. Which place Augustine
entreating of, Mors merit^ stip^ndium, qu^a militiae Diabolicae mors aeterna
tanquam debitum redditur. Vbi cum posset dicere, and recte dicere, Stipendium
just^tiae vita; maluit dicere, Gratia Dei vita aeterna, ut hinc inte^ligeremus,
Deum nos ad vitam aeternam, non pro meritis nostris, sed pro^ sua miseratione
perducere, August. de Great. and lib. arb. cap. 9. and Gloss. Ordm. in Rom 6.
The Apostle, says he, having said, The wages of Sin is Death; because
everlasting death is repaied as of debt due to the service of Sin and Satan;
he does not say, albeit he might also so have said; but the reward of
Righteousness is Life eternal: But he chose rather to say, Gods grace (or
Gratia nisi gratis sit, gratia non est, August. Enchir. c. 107. Gratia enim
vocatur, quia gratis datur. Idem in Joan. 3. Quomodo est ergo gratia, si non
gratis datur: quomodo est gratia, si ex debite redditur? Idem de Great. Chri^ti,
c. 23. Nisi gratuita non est gratia. Ibid. c. 31. Nullo modo est gratia, nisi
fuerit omni modo gratuita. Idem de pecc. Orig. cap. 24.
free favor) is Life eternal; that thereby we might learn that God brings
us to life eternal, not for our Merits, but of his Mercy. In regard whereof
Tertullian also very fitly terms (alluding to military matters) Mortis
stipendium; Vitae donativum. Tertul. de Resurr. carn. Quo vocabulo usus est and
Durand. in 2. Sent. d. 27. q. 2.
the one a Stipend, the other a Donative; because, as Bernard says well,
Aeternam vitam nullis potes operibus promereri, nisi gratis detur and illa,
Bern. de Temp. 48. Vnde and site subjungit Idem ibid. Jpse enim peccata
condonat, ipse donat merita, and praemia nihilominus ipse redonat.
it cannot be had but by Donation, or free gift. And Merces ex dono nulla est,
quae debetur ex opere. Hilar. in Matthew. Can. 20.
if of free gife, then not of due debt, or desert for any work done, says
Hilarie. For, Debitum and donum non consistunt, Faber. in Romans 8.
gift and debt cannot stand together; says Faber. Yea Cardinal Cajetan
himself on those words of the Apostle; Non d^cit, quod st^pe^dia justitiae
vita aeterna: ut intelligamus non ex nostris meritis, sed ex gratuito Dei dono
assequi nos vitam aeternam, Caje^. in Romans 6.
He says not, The wages of righteousness is life eternal; but the grace,
that is, the gift of God, is life eternal; that we may understand that we
attain life eternal not by our merits, but by Gods free gift. For which cause
also he adds, In Christ Jesus our Lord. Ecce meritum; ecce justitia, cujus
stipendium est vita aeterna: nobis au^e^ est donum ratione ipsius Christi Jesus.
Idem ibid.
Behold the merit; behold the righteousness, the wages whereof is life
eternal; but to us in regard of Christ himself it is a gift. And lastly, to
add one place more of so many as might be added; Psalm. 62.12.
With thee is mercy, says the Psalmist to God: for thou will reward every man
according to his works. Concerning which words Gregory, (on that of the
Psalmist, Psalm. 143.8.
Make me to hear thy mercy in the morning; which Greg. in Psalm. Poen^^. 7.
he expounds the Resurrection) having moved this Question; Si illa Sanctorum
f^licitas etc. misericordia est, and non meritis acquiritur, ubi erit, qu^d
scriptum est, Et tu reddes etc. Si secundum opera redditur, quomodo
misericordia aestimabitur?
If the happiness of the Saints be of mercy, and not of merit, how is it said:
Thou will render to each one according to his works? If according to men's works
it be rendered, how may it be deemed mercy? He thus answers; Sed aliud est
secundum opera reddere, and aliud propter ipsa opera reddere, Greg. ibid.
It is one thing to render according to works, and another thing to render the
reward for the works themselves. In co quod ^ec. opera dicitur, i^sa operum
qualitas intelligitur, ut cujus apparuerint bona opera, ejus sit and retributio
gloriosa, Ib.
In the one is noted only the quality of the work, (a far other exposition
than (...) recte vertitur, secundum meritu^, vel pro merito and dignitate
operu^ Quid est enim reddere sec. opera, nisi reddere sicut opera mer^tur? Bell.
de j^s^ific. l. 5. c. 2.
Bellarmine gives of it) that those that have done well, shall receive a
royal reward. (And in the other then consequently should be implied an
equality between the work and the wages. But) Illi namque beatae vitae, in
qua cu^ Deo and de Deo vivitur, nullus poterit aequari labor, nulla opera
co^parari, etc. Greg. ibid.
No labor or work of ours, (nothing that we can either do or endure) by the
Apostles own testimony, can be equal to, or once compared with that blessed
life, wherein men shall live of God and with God. For, Romans 8.18. Minora sunt
omnia quae patimur and ind^gna, pro quoru^ laboribus tanta repe^datur f^turoru^
merces bonorum, Amb. epist. 22.
the sufferings of this life (yea Ne si unus quide^ univ^rsa^ sustineret, B^r.
de Te^p. 48.
all of them, if any one man could and should undergo them all, says Bernard,
(...), Macar. homil. 15.
from the very beginning of the world too, says Macarius, unto the worlds end)
are not worthy, says the Apostle, of the glory that shall be revealed (
(...). Non dicit, nobis, sed, in nobis. Neque enim erimus oti^si spectatores,
sed participes gloriae, 1 Joan. 3.2. Bern. de Praecept. and Disp^ns.
not, unto us, as he also well observes, but) in us. And, Quid sunt merita
omnia ad tantam gloriam? Non sunt talia hominum merita, ut propter ^a vita
aeterna debeatur ex jure; aut Deus injuriam faceret, si e^m non donaret, Bern.
d^ Temp. 48. Itaque site Prosper. in Psalm. 102 Per candem misericordiam dan^ur
cor^nae mer^torum, ^er quam data sunt merita coronarum.
what are all man's merits then, says Bernard, to it; that it should of right
be due to them: or that God should do men wrong, if he bestowed it not on
them? as Rhem. in Hebr. 6.10.
our Rhemists before affirmed that he should. Neque gratia salutis operibus
debetur, sed solius Dei bonitati, Iac. Faber. in Luc. 3.
The grace therefore of salvation is not due to works, says Faber, (
Delcatur, Iudex expurg. Belgic.
which the Popish purgers cross out of him) but to the goodness of God alone.
Non in Meritis, sed in misericordia Dei salus humana consistit, Origin. in Romans
l. 9. c. 11.
Nor does man's salvation consist in man's merits: but in Gods mercy: says
Origin.

Again, the prayers of Gods Saints strike al upon this string. Consider. 2. The
Saints Prayers.
Of David, Chrysostom observes, that though he were (...), Chrysostom. de
Compunct. 2.
a man of singular parts for sincerity and piety, by 1 Samuel 13.14.
Gods own testimony of him; and (...), Ide^ in Psa. 12.
had many good deeds that he might have alleged, yet (...), Ibid.
in all his prayers ordinarily (...), Ibid.
he has recourse only to Gods mercy, (...), Ibid.
that alone he pleads, that alone he relieth upon, (...), Ide^ de Compunct.
2.
and desires to be saved by. (...), Chrysostom. in Psalm. 12.
Let others, says he, allege and plead what they list; Psalm. 13.5.
I will hope in thy mercy: that I plead and allege, and that do I hang all
mine hope upon. And, Psalm. 4.2.
Have mercy on me, and hear me; and, Psalm. 6.2.
Have mercy on me for I am weak. And, (...), Chrysostom. in Psalm. 6.
The same song, says he, have we need to sing every one of us, albeit we had
done ten thousand times ten thousand good deeds, and attained even to the very
highest pitch and perfection of righteousness: (...), Idem in Psalm. 4.
for it is yet of mercy and loving kindness still that that we are heard,
and that we are saved for all that. So the same David again elsewhere,
Psalm. 109.21.
But thou Lord deal mercifully with me for thy Name sake. And, Psalm. 6.4. and
31.16. and 109.26.
Save me for thy Mercy sake. Propter misericordiam tuam, non propter meritum
meum, August in Psalm. 6. and Ruff^^. ibid.
For thy mercy, not for my merit, says Augustine. In misericordia tua, non in
justitia mea. Ruffin. in Psalm. 30.
For thy mercy, not for my righteousness, says Ruffine. (...), Chrysostom. in
Psalm. 108. Non quia ego sum dignus, sed quia tu es misericors, Aug. in Psalm.
30. Conc. 3.
Not because I am worthy, but because thou art merciful; says Chrysostom.
(...), Chrysostom. ibid.
He flies only to Gods goodness and his loving kindness: Gratuita gratia
commendatur, non ex op^rum debito, Prosper. post. Aug. in Psalm. 108.
Commending Gods free grace, not claiming ought as due to his good deeds, says
Prosper. It is as if he had said; Non de meis meritis confidens, ut me sal^u^
facias suppl^^o, sed de sola misericordia tua praesumens impetrare, quo non de
meritis meis spero, Greg. in Psalm Poenit. 1.
I entreat thee to save me, says Gregory, not trusting to mine own merits,
but presuming only to obtain that of thy mercy, which by mine own merits I
have no hope to obtain: Or, Noli me audire secundum judiciariam sev^ritatem,
sed sec. misericordissimam bonitatem, August. in Psalm. 30. and ex eodem
Lombard. ibid.
I entreat thee to hear me, not in thy judiciarie severity, but in thy most
merciful bounty; says Augustine. Negat merita sua, Cassiod. in Psalm. 30.
He renounceth his own merit: and, Salvum se petit fieri, non sec. merita sua,
sed propter divinam misericordum: in qua dum fixa spes ponitur, venia facilius
impetratur, Idem in Psalm. 6.
he desires to be heard, says Cassiodore, not according to his merits, but
for Gods mercy sake: whereon when our hope is fixed, pardon is the easilier
obtained. And, Psalm. 119.41.
Let thy mercy also betide me, and thy salvation, according to thy Word.
Secundum verbum tuum, non sec. meritum meum, August. in Psalm. 118.
According to thy word, not according to my merit; Filius esse vult
promissionis, non elationis, Ibid.
A child he would be not of pride, but of the promise, says Augustine. And
again; Psalm. 25.11.
For thy Name sake be merciful to my sin: for it is much. Propter nomen
tuum, non propter meritum meum, Ruffin. in Psalm. 24.
For thy Name, not for my merit; says Ruffine: and Bernard; Sed and
quantumlibet poeniteat, quantumlibet se affl^ctet and maceret, Propter nomen
tuum, non propter meritum meum propitiaberis peccato meo, ait justus, Bern. de
Diverse. 22.
Be I never so penitent, and afflict and macerate my self never so much. Totam
salute^ sua^ hic attribuit misericord^ae salvatoris, Hugo in Psalm. 24.
He attributes his whole salvation to the mercy of his Savior, says
Cardinal Hugh. And, Psalm. 25.7.
In mercy remember me, or think upon me, for thy goodness sake, O Lord. Non
secundu^ ira^, qua ego dignus su^; sed sec. misericordiam tuam, quae te digna
est, Aug. in Psalm. 24.
Not in wrath, as I am worthy; but as is worthy of thee in thy mercy; says
Augustine. Non propter meritu^ m^u^, sed propter bonitatem tua^. Ex Aug.
Alcuin. and Gloss. Ordin. Lomb. in Psalm. 24.
For thy goodness, not for any merit of mine; says Peter Lombard. For,
Dicendo, Propter bon. t. D. fecit intelligi, Non propter mer. meum. Cassiod.
ibid.
When he says, For thy goodness, his meaning is, and he would so be
understood, Not for my merit; says Cassiodore. Who thence also observes that,
Vnde nullum fas est aliquando praesumere, nisi que^ graviter contingit errare,
Idem ibid.
No man without grievous error, may presume at any time thereon. And yet
again; Psalm. 31.3.
For thy Name sake guide and conduct me. Propter nome^ tuum, no^ propter
meritum meum, Aug. in Psalm. 30. Conc. 1. and Hugo ibid. and in Psalm. 142.
For thy Name, not for my merit; says Augustine, and Hugh the Cardinal after
him: Non quia ego sum dignus; sed ut tu glorificeris, Idem ibid.
Not for my worth, desert, or dignity, but for thy glory. And Hilarie on those
words of his, Psalm. 119.149.
Hear my voice according to thy mercy, or thy loving kindness, O Lord. Nos
si semel jejunamus ut hominibus placeamus, aut exiguum nescio quid damus, dum
pulsantem fores nostras inopem non sustinemus; deberi nobis ut audiamur
existimamus, Hilar. in Psalm. 118. part. 19
We, says he, when we have fasted some once, out of vainglory, or given
ought to a beggar for his mere importunity, think that God is bound by and
by to hear us; Post haec etc. in operibus bonitatis totius perfectus, totum de
Deo sperat, totum ex misericordia ej^s expectat, omnem in ea spem repon^t,
au^^ri secundum ^am vocem suam r^gat, Ibid.
Whereas David after all his hearty crying, his night watchings, his early
meditations, his continency in his younger years, his diligent inquiry into
Gods Statutes, and his careful keeping of his Testimonies, having attained to
a perfection in all kind of goodness, yet has his hope wholly in God, and
expects all from his mercy, places all his hope in it, and desires to be
heard according to it. And Chrysostom preaching upon the Prayer of Eleazer,
entreating Genesis 24.12.
mercy and kindness for his Master Abraham; ( See Sermon on Eleazers Prayer.
and whose merits might better have been pleaded than his?) (...), etc.
Chrysostom. tom. 8. sermon. 15.
That you may not imagine, says he, that he demanded it as a debt, Deal
mercifully or show mercy, says he, to my Master Abraham. (...), Ibid.
Though we had done ten thousand good deeds, says he, yet is it of grace that
we require to be saved, and of loving kindness, not of debt or desert that
we look to receive this. So the Apostle; 2 Timothy 1.16, 17.
The Lord show mercy to Onesiphorus his family. (The Lord show him mercy,
because he showed me mercy.) For he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed
of my chains; but when he was at Rome he diligently sought me and found me;
and in how many things he steeded me (or supplied me) at Ephesus, thou well
know. And, Ibid. 18.
the Lord grant therefore, that he may find mercy with the Lord in that day.
Vt sicut Apostolum requirens invenit, sic and misericordiam quaerens inveniat
apud judicem, Ambr. nomine in 1 Timothy 1.
That as he sought me and found me; so he may find mercy when he shall
seek it at the hand of his Judge; says one that bears the name of Ambrose.
(...), Chrysostom. in 2 Timothy hom. 3.
That as I found mercy with him, so may he find mercy with God; says
Chrysostom: And mark you, says he, how he says, (...).
nothing, or not any thing but mercy: Eleemosynam, that is, word for word,
Alms, that which Ruard. Tapper. supra. Absit, (...) pauperes eleemosyna^
expectent.
the Popish Professor so much scorned before: Mercy in that day, wherein (...).
we shall have much need of it; (...), Chrysostom. ibid.
if Onesiphorus for all these his good works, we (the most of us) much more.
There is mercy as well for those that help him, as 2 Timothy 4.14, 16. Aliter
enim de eis, qui ex malitia obstiterant; aliter pro eis, qui ex infirmitate
deliquerant, uti and Aug. observat in Josh. quaest. 30.
for those that forsook him; as well mercy in rewarding the one, as mercy in
pardoning and not punishing the other. So Daniel also, Dan. 9.18. Vide Hug.
Card. in Job 9.21.
We present these our prayers unto thee, not for any our righteousness, (that
is, any righteous works of ours; (...), Greg. Naz. adv. Eunom. Orat. 4.
for we have none, says Gregory Nazianzene; such at least as we dare plead
the worth of) but for thy tender mercies. Whereupon also says Aquinas,
Impetratio orationis innititur misericordiae; meritum aute^ condigni innititur
justitiae. Et ideo multa orando impetrat homo ex divina misericordia, quae
tamen non meretur secundum justitiam, Tho. sum. part. 1a. 2 ae. q. 114. a. 6.
Obtaining by prayer indeed rests upon mercy; where as merit of condignitie
rests upon justice or righteousness: and therefore by prayer do men obtain
many things of God in mercy, which yet in justice they deserve not. Yea so the
Papists themselves in their Liturgy, (retaining yet still some broken relikes
of Antiquity) contrary to their Schoole-learning, desire God Non meriti
aestimator, sed veniae largitor, Missal. in post-commun.
not to ponder their merits, but to pardon their misdeeds; and so consequently
Psalm. 65.3.
to be merciful (as the Psalmist speaks) to their sins. And, a Popish
Writer commenting upon that place; Quid meriti apud Deum po^erimus obtendere,
cui debemus omnia? Luc. 17.10. Quid nobis de bonis operibus poterimus
applaudere, cum universae justitiae nostrae sint quasi pannus menstruatae apud
Dominum? Esai. 64.6. Nulla igitur in Deum sunt nostra merita, cui debita sunt
omnia quae praestamus. Iodoc. Cl^cthov. in Canon. Miss.
What merit, says he, can we pretend or plead to God, whom we owe all unto?
Or how can we applaud our selves in our good deeds, when all our
righteousness is but as a filthy ragge in Gods sight? Our merits therefore
are none to God, whom all that we do, is due unto, etc. And it is a good Rule
that Bernard gives for Prayer in general: Qui petit, primo d^bet attendere,
ut pro suis me^itis nihil accepturu^ se putet, sed de Dei mis^ricordia tantum,
quicquid rogaverit, impetraturum. Bern. in Sentent.
He that comes, says he, to ask ought of God, must in the first place
have an eye unto this, that he look not to receive ought for his own worth
or merits, but hope to obtain whatsoever he craves, only of Gods mercy. And
when we come to pray (says Aquinas) we must Causam excogitare quare debeat
concedi: and hoc non merita nostra, sed miseratio Domini, Aquin. in 1 Timothy 2.
devise some cause why our suit should be heard, and that must be not our
merit, but Gods mercy: according to that of Daniel above mentioned, which he
also there alleges.

It is all of mercy therefore, that God promises: It is all of mercy that
Gods children pray for. It is Hebr. 4.16.
a Throne of grace that they repair unto; and it is Jbidem.
mercy that they there sue for. It is for mercy all that they pray; And to
mercy it is, that they ascribe all: whatsoever either by prayer they obtain
at Gods hand, or Fides aliquando recipit, quod oration non praesumit, Bern. de
Grad. humil. Et instat in Laz. resuscitato, Joan. 11.23.
without prayer they have voluntarily conferred on them by him, (as Jacob here
much more than ever Genesis 28.20. Vberior semper est Dei gratia, quam nostra
precatio, Ambros. in Luc. Et instat. in latrone in Paradisum tra^slato. Luc.
23.42, 43. Sic 2 Paral. 1.12. Psalm. 21.4. Luc. 15.19, 22.
he did or durst ask,) they acknowledge all to come of mercy. Genesis 33.6.
They are the children, says Jacob, that God has of his mercy given thy
Servant. And, Genesis 33.11.
God has been merciful to me: and therefore have I all this. And here in my
Text; All the mercies, that thou have showed me. Even Iusti nihil tribuent
meritis suis. No^ tribuent nisi totum misericordiae tuae, Aug. in Psalm. 139.
the Just, says Augustine, will ascribe nothing to their merits, but give all
only to Gods mercy. For, De est gratiae, quicquid meritis deputas, Ber. in
Can. 67.
All is taken from the one, that is ascribed to the other, says Bernard.

Now this first again serves even to cut the very throat of that Romish
Doctrine of Merit. Use 1.
For mercy and merit (as they understand it) by their own confession cannot
stand together. Id quod ex condigno quis meretur, non ex m^s^ratione, sed ex
merito accip^t, Thom. sum. part. 1a. 2 ae. q. 114. a. 3.
That which a man meriteth, say they, he has not of mercy. And, it is
Secundum judicium justitiae, Tho. ibid. Impetratio orationis nititur
misericordiae; meritum autem condigni innititur justitiae, Idem ibid. art. 6.
according to the judgment (not of mercy, but) of justice, that man's merit is
rewarded. Where to omit that Etiam merces nostra gratia vocatur. Si gratia est,
gratis datur. Aug. in Psalm. 31. Nam gratia sic nominatur, quia gratis datur,
Idem in Psalm. 43. Opponitur autem gratia debi^o, Bellarm. de Great. and lib.
arb. l. 1. c. 1. ex Romans 4.4. and 11.6.
even the reward, that we expect for our well doing to receive, is, as
Augustine from the Apostle Romans 4.4* and 6.22, 23.
Paul's speech observes, and Augustine. de Civitat. lib. 12. cap. 9. Scripsit
ipsam beatitudin^m hominibus nunc esse donum, quae merces meriti futura erat,
si primus homo ^^are voluisset, Bellarmin. ibidem, lib. 2. cap. 17.
Bellarmine himself also from him acknowledges, of grace or free favor,
(which before also was showed:) and consequently by their own grants also,
Quaerimus misericordiae meritum, and non invenimus: quia nullum est
misericordiae meritum, ne gratia evacuetur, si non gratis don^tur, sed meritis
redditur, Lombard. Sent. lib. 1. d 41. A. ex Aug. ep. 105.
not of merit, but of mere mercy. As the Apostle reasons concerning
Election; Romans 11.6 Omne meritum repugnat gratiae, Thom. sum. part. 1a. 2 ae.
q. 114. a. 5.
If it be of grace, then it is not of works: for else grace were no grace. If
it be of works, then it is not of grace: for else work were no work. So here,
Si misericordia est, meritis non acquiritur, Greg. sup. in Psalm. P^n. 7. Vide
and quae Thom. sup. Quod redditur potius ex liberalitate dantis quam ex debito
operis, non cadit sub merito de condigno sir^cte and proprie sumpto, Durand. in
Sent. lib. 2. d. 27. q. 2.
That which is of mercy, is not of merit: for else mercy were no mercy. And
that which is of merit, is not of mercy: for else merit were no merit. Since
it is no mercy to afford a man what he has merited: no just merit that has
need of mercy. Or thus; Miseremini mei; non quia d^gnus, sed quia inops; non
quia merui, sed quia eg^^. Iustitia meritum quaerit, misericordia miser^am,
Bern. epist. 12.
If it be of right, then it is not of mercy: for else right were no right. If
it be of mercy, then it is not of right, or due debt: for then mercy were no
mercy. Since Si dantur hominibus b^na pro meritis co^u^, quae gratia Dei erit?
Sicut si pater^am lias s^ivat operario operatione^ quam ipse meruit, in hoc
nullam gratiam ei ^acit, Guil. Perald. sum. tom. 2. tract. 6. part. 3. cap. 2.
it is no point of mercy to give a man his due: nor needs he crave or sue
for mercy, that demands but his due, and requires consequently but his
own: As merit therefore leaves no place for mercy: so ( Non est quo gratia
intret, ubi jam meritum occupavit, Bern. in Cant. 67.
there is no entrance for grace, says Bernard, where merit is once got in.)
Mercy likewise leaves no place for merit: the rather since that also, (as
well Primasius observes) when he has done all, and can claim nothing as due
therefore for what he does of due debt. For Cu^ justificat impium divina

Primas. in R^m. 4. and H^eron. nomine ibid.
he is a debtor (says he, and (...), Romans 8.12.
the Apostle before him) and stands bound to do what he does, before he do
it; and is justly and deservedly damned, if he do it not; and when he has
done all he can, he has nothing to glory of, because he has done nothing
but what he stood bound to do. It being most true that 59. Bern. in Ser. de

bona esse d^b^ta Deo, ita ut possit omnia exigere, etiamsi praemium nullum dare
velit, Bellarm. de Iustific. l. 5. c. 13.
S. Bernard, says Bellarmine, shows in a Sermon of his, that for sundry
respects, the good works that we do are all due to God, and God might
therefore well require them of us, though he rendered us no reward for them:
and therefore cannot we challenge any reward at Gods hand for them. And Quid
ergo de nobis sentiendum qui non omnia servamus, qui multorum rei sumus? Non
in^tiles tantum, sed minus quam inutiles nos esse, Cajetan in Luc. 17.
how much less than can any man by way of condign merit or due debt claim
ought at Gods hand, when Nemo Deo totum reddit quod debet, Bernard. de Diverse.

Let who will, therefore trust to merit: Sic Luk 18.13. Publicanus (...),

let us fly to, let us rely upon mercy. For Quid faciat justus and misericors

as it is a point of mercy with God to vouchsafe mercy to such as submissively
and sincerely sue for it, seek to it, and rely wholly upon it: So it shall be
just with him to turn them off to their own merits, and to deal with them as
they deserve, that renouncing his mercy rely on their own merits, and offer
themselves to be judged by his justice alone: (And Psalm. 130.3, 4. and 143.2,

in a woeful estate are all those, that come so to be judged:) That renouncing
expressly as well Christ's merit as Gods mercy, (they do so in precise terms,
I do them no wrong) Si non pro meriti^ operum, sed in gratiam fidei and

Father, nor from the free bounty and liberality of a Prince, (they are
Bellarmines own words) but from the justice of a Judge; Merces o^ Christi

how can a man be truly thankful to God for ought, that thinks he has
nothing from him, but what he has deserved, he has deerly earned, is of right
due to him, and he should have wrong if he had it not?

before us) that it is, as our highest 1 Cor. 3.18. Sap^ens ne sit, ut sit

teach us lowliness, thankfulness, Use 2.
and contentment of mind: Genesis 31.38. -- 40.
What we have earned dearly and is owing us, we may justly expect, and
claim as of right due to us: and we think much when we come to demand a debt
of one that owes it us, Moles^um verbum est, and on^rosum, and di^isso vult^^
dicend^, R^g^, Se^ de ^^nif. l. 2. c. 2.
to crave it in any submissive manner; and much more to be denied it, when we
make demand of it: for we are wont to say in such cases, that we ask but our
own. But when we come to crave a courtesy, to request a kindness (from a
superior especially) of one that is no way indebted or engaged unto us, we are
glad to come with cap in hand, and Audi voces petentium: Nemo no^ victuram

we are wont to be well content (if but in part he please to grant our
request) with what he is willing to afford us; and think that we have cause to
be thankful to him for it, whatsoever it be, be it never so mean; because it
is more than of right we could challenge or demand of him. So here, Audacter
Deum roga, nihil illum de alieno rogaturus, Sen. epist. 10.
if we could claim or challenge ought at Gods hand by way of merit or due debt
upon desert, it were somewhat; some color we might have to repine, when we had

when we have not as others have. But whenas God is no way thus endebted to
any; 1 Chronicles. 29.11, 14, 16.
all is absolutely his own; and Matthew. 20.25.
he may do as he will with it: when as we come to him as (...), Greg. Naz. pro

reason now to repair to him in the submissest manner that may be: we have no
reason to repine, if he give us less than we would; ( Beggars, we say, must
be no chusers:) or Nemo alij aut participium, aut parilitatem, (aut

would take it in foul scorn, that every base fellow should take upon him to

as he ought. Whereas we should rather endeavor (...), Aristot. Stob. c. 3.

hand, we in thankfulness enlarge also our hearts: being thankful to him for
whatsoever we have, be it more or less; since that it is all of mere mercy;
not discontent for what we have not, or for what we see others have.

Grounds 2. Particular. 3. Gods truth. Mercy and Truth.
And thus was the former Ground of Gods goodness, his Mercy: the later
follows now, Veracitie, his Fidelity, his Truth.

Truth has here reference to a word of promise. And we may do well to
observe how these two are still coupled and yoaked together, Mercy and Truth.
Psalm. 25.10.
All the ways of God are Mercy and Truth, says the Psalmist; and that even
to those that keep covenant with him. And, Psalm. 36.5.
Thy Mercy, O Lord, reaches unto the heavens, and thy Truth or Faithfulness
unto the clouds. And, Psalm. 40.11.
withdraw not thy tender Mercies from me, O Lord: but let thy Mercy and thy
Truth always preserve me. And, Psalm. 138.2.
I will praise thee for thy Mercy and thy Truth, etc. The one is the ground of
Gods gracious promises: the other is the ground of the performance of what
therein he has promised. It is his Mercy that he does ought at first, and
that he promises further to do ought, And it is his Truth and his Justice,
(for Ephesians. 4.24, 25. Veritas, sive veracitas pars est justitiae. Ex Cicer. de
Invent. Thom. sum. part. 2^.2 ae. q. 109. a. 3.
Truth is a part also of Justice) that he performs and makes good what he
has promised.

So that here is

A second ground of Gods goodness, Ground 2. Observe. 4*
unto those whom by promise he has vouchsafed to tie himself unto, His Word
and his Truth.

Psalm. 43.3.
Send forth thy light and thy Truth, says the Psalmist, to bring me again to
thine holy Hill. And, Psalm. 54.5.
Destroy mine enemies in thy Truth. And, Psalm. 89.24, 28.
My Mercy and truth, says God, shall always be with him: and my covenant
shall stand firm with him for ever. For, Psalm. 89.33, 34.
I will not break my covenant; nor will I falsify my Truth. And, Psalm. 146.5,
6.
Blessed therefore is the man, whose hope is in the Lord, who keeps his Truth
for ever. It is his Mercy that moves him; it is his Truth that binds him.
It is his Mercy, I say, that induces him to promise: it is his Truth that
obliges him to make good what he has promised. A sure tie-all. Mark. 13.31.
Heaven and earth may fail sooner than Gods Truth; than Josh. 23.14.
he should fail to make good ought that he has promised to his.

For first, it is against the very nature of God to do otherwise.
Confirmation. Reason 1.
Psalm. 94.9, 10. Non ergo audit, qui ^ecit t^bi unde audias? and non videt, qu^

If you that are evil know how to give good things to your children; how much
more, says our Savior, shall your heavenly Father, who is (...), Sol^^ ^onus,
Matthew. ^9.17.
goodness it self, give good things to his? So if Psalm 5.4.
an honest man will be careful to keep his word, one that has but some
small drop of this divine Truth distilled into his heart, which flows
infinitely in God, how much more shall he do so, who is 1 John 5.6, 7.
Truth it self, and who Vult D^um non esse Deum* qui vult cum aut impotente^,
aut injustum ^ss^, aut insip^^^te^, Ber. de Temp. 58.
can no more cease to be true or to be just than he can cease to be God. Reason
2.


Again, is not God as prone (think we) and as ready unto Mercy as unto
wrath; to do good as to Esai. 45.7. Mala ulto^ia, non p^ccatoria: poenae, non
culpae; supplicia, no^ delicta, Tertull. in Marc. l. 2. and 3. Mala, non

2. c. 17.
do evil; to bless as to curse; to fulfill his promises, as to execute his
threatenings and his menaces; to cause to prosper, as to punish? Yes
undoubtedly, and (if we may say so) Exodus 34.6, 7. Psalm. 30.5. and 86.15. and
103.8. and 145.8. (...), Greg. Naz. Epitaph. Patr. Et piger ad poenas Deus, est
ad praemia velox. Ovid. Pont. l. 1. el. 3.
much more. But Gods threatenings against the wicked shall undoubtedly take
effect. God has even Deu. 29.19, 20. and 32*40, 41, 42.
by a solemn oath bound himself thereunto: and that Psalm. 68.21. Mat. 25.46.
they shall find to their endless woe one day unfailable, that now either
deny it, or make doubt of it. And much more then shall his free promises be
made good all to the godly: The rather since that Hebr. 6.17, 18. Jurat nobis,
per quem juramus: nec potest ab eo quisquam ^alli, quo invocato non licet
impune mentiri, Athalar. apud Cassiod. var. l. 8. ep. 3.
he has bound himself by oath as well to the fulfilling of the one, as to
the effecting and executing of the other.

Now this consideration may first serve to clear many places of Scripture, Use
1.
where Gods children seem to require God even Psalm. 143.1, 11.
in justice to hear, and help them, and do for them, and deliver them: And
where God is said to be 1 John 1.9.
just, either in remitting of men's sins, or Hebr. 6.10. 2 Thessalonians. 1.6. 2. Tim.
4.8.
in rewarding of their works. Which places Bellar. de Justice. l. 1. c. 21. and
l. 5. c. 3, 16. Rheme^s. in Heb. 6. and 2 Thessalonians. 1. and ^lij.
Popish writers are wont to abuse and produce for the justification of their
pernicious Positions concerning man's merit, and the worth of men's works. As if
in those places Gods children pleaded unto God their own merits, in regard
whereof God in justice might not deny them their suits, they requiring nothing
but what by their own righteous actions they had even in justice deserved at
Gods hands: Or as if Gods justice it self so tied him to the rewarding of
their works, in regard of the very worth and dignity of them, that God could
not without some taint of injustice do otherwise. But Apertum est qua ratione
Iustitia^ Domini petebat, qui dicit, Ne intres in judicium, etc Nam si justitia
judicium significasset, hoc petere non poterat, quod pavebat. Cassiodor. in
Psalm. 142. Et causa reddita est, quare ^oluerit ad judicium venire cum Domino,
ut no^ sola potestatis reverentia, sed ipsa etia^ videatur justitiae regula
formidata, ib.
that the justice or righteousness that the Saints and servants of God speak
of in those places, neither is, nor respects simply the justice or
righteousness of their persons, in regard whereof, and for the worth of which,
God in justice, were engaged to do for them what they require of him, is hereby
apparent, in that in some of those very places, where they require or plead
this justice, Psalm. 143.2, 8 No^ contendit judicio, nec praetendit justitiam;
recusat judicium, Postu^it mis^ricordiam: faciliu^ sibi veniam impetrare posse,
quam justitiam vendicare confidens. Bern. ep. 42. Qui and subjungit; Sola
profec^o quae non solet gloriari, non novit praesumere, contendere non
consuevit, gratiam inventura est in oculis pietatis humil^tas.
they sue yet for mercy, and renounce their own righteousness, and refuse to
be tried by the precise Rule of Gods justice.

But what justice or righteousness will some say, then is it?

I answer: It is sometime Psalm. 4.1, 2. Deus just mi: vel Deus justitia me^,
i. causae justae me^, ut Iun. and Piscat. Sic Psalm. 119.121.
the justice of their cause; when being falsely accused, and wrongfully
charged, by their malicious Adversaries, with such crimes as they never either
committed or imagined, they dare Psalm. 7.3, 4, 8.
appeal even to Gods justice, and offer themselves to be tried thereby for
their innocence therein.

Sometime it is Gods justice and righteousness, that is, his Truth, or his
Faithfulness; which the Psalmist therefore Psalm. 143.1.
joyneth together, (it is Veritate^ and justitiam pro e^dem accipit, Hugo in
Psalm. 142. and ex Cassiodor. Lombard ibid.
Hugh the Cardinals observation) as one and the same. For Bellar. ipse ex illis
verbis Neh. 9.8. Et implesti verba tua, quoniam justus es, de Justice. l. 5. c.
16.
truth or faithfulness is (as before was said) a branch and a limme of justice
or righteousness. That which even our Adversaries themselves also confess and
acknowledge, expounding some such places so also themselves. 1 John 1.9.
If we confess our sins, says S. John, God is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us (how but by Ibid. verse. 7. Apoc. 1.5.
Christ's blood?) from all iniquity. Here Verba illa, Iustus and Fidelis,
referuntu^ ad promissionem divinam, Bellar. de Poenit. l. 3. c. 6.
those words just and faithful, says Bellarmine, are referred to Gods
promise: Ideo enim Deus ^idelis and justus dicitur, quia peccata co^fitentibus
remitt^t, quia stat promissis, nec fide^ fallit. Bellar. ibid.
For therefore, says he, is God said to be faithful and just, because he
stands to his word, and breaks not his faith. Though therein ^oquitur de
remissione venialium, quae justo Dei judicio redditur bonis meritis justortu^.
Ide^ de Iustif. l. 1. c. 21.
he crosses himself again elsewhere; and he adds wretchedly, yea
impiously in the same place, that Promissio de remittendis peccatis, eis qui
confitentur Deo, non vid^tur ulla extare in divinis literis, Bellar. ubi. sup.
there seems to be no promise at all extant in Scripture concerning
remission of sins upon confession of them made unto God. In like manner where
the Apostle says, Hebr. 6.10.
For God is not unjust, to forget your work and labor of love, which you show
to his Name, in ministering to his Saints. Manifest significat eum injustum
fore si secus faceret, Bellar. de Iustific. l. 5. c. 16.
He shows manifestly, says Bellarmine, that he should be unjust, if he did
otherwise. And therefore Non est temerarium et blasphemu^, sed pium and sanctu^
dicere, D^um fore injustum, si non servaret promissa, ib.
it is neither hold nor blasphemous to say, that God should be unjust, if he
should not keep his promises: to confute which assertion, See Durands own
words at large in the end.
falsely fathered upon Durand, whom therein he does wrong too, he produces
that place. Again whereas S. Paul says, 2 Timothy 4.8.
There is a crown of righteousness (and so it may be, and yet (...), Chrysostom.
in Psalm 5.12.
a crown of mercy too, says Chrysostom) laid up for me, which the just
Judge will render unto me in that day; and not to me alone, but to all those
that love his appearance, Est quam Paulus expectat corona justitiae, sed
justitia Dei, non suae, Iustu^ quippe est, ut reddat quod debet: d^bet autem
quod pollicitus est, Bernard. de Great. and lib. A^b.
It is not his own righteousness, but Gods righteousness, says Bernard,
that the Apostle here builds upon. For it is a just thing for God to pay that
that he owes. And he owes that that he has promised. Qui credidit
promittenti, 2 Timothy 1.12. fidenter promissum repetit: promissum quidem ex
misericordia, sed jam ex justitia persolvendum.
It was out of mercy indeed promised, but it is of justice to be performed.
Et h^c est justitia, de qua praesus mit Apostolus, promissio Dei, Ibid.
And this is the justice that the Apostle here presumes of, even Gods promise.
For Just jam and ex debito requiritur, quodcunque vel gratis promittitur,

that may well be of justice and due debt required, that was freely promised at

That which God does of grace or free favor, says he, that he may not do:
(or he may choose whether he will do or no.) But yet when he has promised
once to do it, he cannot now but do it, though not simply and absolutely,
yet in respect of his promise. Hence is that that Augustine, and Fulgent ad
Monim, praefat. Idem author est deb^ti, qui author est doni. Nam and seips^m sua

God, says he, albeit he be debtor to none, yet has he made himself a
debtor to us. But how? Not by receipt, but by promise. Not by receiving of ought
from us; but by promising what he pleased and thought good himself unto us.
In regard whereof very pithily and piously says Bernard, Ius meum voluntas
judicis mei. Quid justius meritum? Quid ditus ad praemium? Bern. in Cant. 14.
Et Chrysostom. in Psalm. 143. (...).
My Judges will (or good will) is my right. What can be righter? What can be
richer? What righter for merit? What richer for recompense? Now Aliter dicimus
homini, debes mihi, quia dedi tibi, and aliter d^cimus, Debes mihi, quia
promisisti mihi. Ibi a te processit beneficium, sed mutuatum, non donatum. Hic
tu nihil dedisti, and tamen exigis. Bonitas enim ejus, qui promisit, dabit; ne
in malitiam fides convertatur. Qui autem fallit, malus est. Augustine. de verb.
Apost. 16.
it is one thing to say to one, You owe me this or that, because I have
bestowed somewhat upon you, or have done this or that for you, and have thereby
deserved it: and another thing to say, You owe me this or that, because you
promised to bestow it on me. In the one, the ground of the debt arises from
the work or deed and desert of the party that claims it: in the other, from
the word and promise of him, of whom it is claimed, Deo igitur quid dicimus?
Read mihi quia dedi tibi? Quid dedimus Deo, quando totum quod sumus boni, ab
illo habemus? Non est quemadmodum ista voce exigamus debitore^ Deum. Quis enim
prior dedit ei, etc. illo ergo modo possumus exigere Dominum nostru^ ut
dicamus; Read quod promisisti, quia fecimus quod jussisti, and hoc tu secisti,
qui laborantes j^visti, August. de verb. Ap. 16. Non possumus ei dicere, Read

In the former sense, says Augustine, can no man claim ought of God: because
no man can by any such means tie or engage God to himself. But in the latter
sense some may, in regard of his promise past to them, by which, though free
otherwise, Omnis enim vera promissio sor^ secum obligationem: and ideo ex
justitia implenda and servanda est, Bellarm. de Iustific. lib. 5. cap. 16. Et

he has bound himself to do for them, to the performance whereof, his truth
and his justice do now tie him. By virtue of which truth and justice Gods
Saint^ often require that of God, which in justice otherwise they durst not, nor
could claim or challenge at his hands as of due debt or of desert.

Again, this may further be of singular ^se to all Gods dear children and
faithful servants to hearten and encourage them quietly and contentedly to
rest and repose themselves wholly upon him and his truth, for the making good
of all his gracious promises unto them. Heb. 13.5, 6.
Let your conversation, says the Apostle, be without covetousness, (yea or
distrustfulnesse either;) and rest contented with what you have. For he has
said, (and what he has said, concerns us, as well as either Genesis 28.15.

The Lord is my feeder; I am sure to want nothing: and, Psalm. 27.1. and 118.6.
The Lord is mine helper; I need not fear any thing. He has said it: and that
is enough; we need no other security, his bare word is as good, yea better than
any bond. For he is Psalm. 31.5.
a God of truth; and 2 Timothy 2 8.
cannot go from his word. And Esai. 28.16.

truth. Now follows a fruit and effect, Fruit and Effect of Gods Goodness.

THE IVDGEMENT OF a great Schoole-man, concerning the Merit of man's works;
contrary to that which the Church of Rome now holds* Durandus in Sentent.
lib. 2. did. 27. quaest. 2.
MErit of condignitie strictly and properly taken, is such a voluntary action
for which in justice or of right a reward is due to one, so that if it be not
rendered, he that should render it does wrong, and is simply and properly
unjust. And such merit of condignitie is found among men, but is not in man
toward God.

That which hereby appears, because that which is rendered rather out of the
liberality of the giver, than out of any debt due to the work, comes not
within the compass of Merit of condignitie strictly and properly taken.

But whatsoever we receive from God, be it grace or glory, or good temporal,
or spiritual (whatsoever good work done for the same go before in us) we
receive rather and more principally from Gods liberality, than rendered as due
for the desert of the work.

And therefore nothing at all comes within compass of Merit of condignitie
so taken.

The Major appears by the definition of Merit of condignitie before assigned.

The Minor is thus proved: because it is an easier and a less matter to make a
full recompense for that that one has received from another, than to make him
a debtor. For to make him a debtor, it is necessary that one return him more
than he has received from him, that so in regard of that overplus the other
may become his debtor.

But no man can fully recompense God; according to that which the Aristot.
Ethic. lib. 8. cap. 14.
Philosopher says, That God and our Parents can never be sufficiently
recompensed.

Therefore much less is it possible, that by any work of ours God should
become debtor to us, so that he should be injust, if he paid us not somewhat
for it, that were due unto us for the same.

The reason hereof is, because what we are, and what we have, be it good
actions, or good dispositions, or the use of them, etc. it is all in us of Gods
liberality, both freely bestowing it on us, and freely preserving it in us.
And because by a free gift no man is bound to give more: but the receiver
rather is thereby bound to the giver.

Therefore by good dispositions, or good actions, or the good use of either
bestowed on us by God, God is not bound in any bond of justice to give us ought
else, so that if he should not give it, he should be unjust; but we are
rather thereby bound to God. And to think or say the contrary, is bold and
blasphemous. And if God therefore to a man dying in grace should deny glory,
he should do therein no wrong: nor should he be unjust, if he should
withdraw glory from one that already has it. And if any should complain
hereof, God might say unto him, as it is in the Gospel, Math. 20.15*
May I not do as I will with mine own? And the party that should suffer it,
ought to say as Job did, Job 1.21.
The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken; he has done as he pleased:
blessed be his Name. For since that every good thing is of Gods free gift, God
is not bound thereby, because he has given some thing, to give other some
also, so that he should be unjust, if he gave them not. And if any thing be
bestowed on us, or returned to us for our good works, it is rather and more
principally out of Gods liberality that gives it, than out of any debt that
is due to our works.

If any shall say, that albeit God become not a debtor by any work of ours,
yet he becomes a debtor by his own promise Iam. 1.12.
expressed in Scriptur.

It is of no force, for two causes:

The first is, because Gods promise in Scripture implies no such obligation,
but imports only a liberal disposition in God.

The second is, because that which is rendered, is not rendered for the due
desert of the work, but for the promise precedent. It is not, I say, rendered,
for the condign merit of the work, but only or principally for the promise:
And so it is not such debt, as we now speak of.

Thus it appears that Merit of condignitie strictly and properly taken, to
wit, for a voluntary action, for which a reward is of justice due to the doer,
so that if it be not paid, he that should pay it, does wrong, and is simply
and properly unjust; is not in man toward God, yea that it is altogether
impossible for any such to be.

FINIS.
