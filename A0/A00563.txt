To the right honorable my very good lord and master Edward de Vere Earl of
Oxenford, vicount Bulbecke, lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord great
Chamberlayne of England. John Farmer wishes long and happy life with increase
of honor.
IT was mine exercise, right honorable and my singular good Lord, to make upon
a playnsong not long a go forty several ways of 2. parts in one, with what
commendation, I shall then perceive, when other shall have judged, with what
study, my self am privy: neither long, nor serious. This poor conceit I have
presumed of your honorable favor to present unto your Lordship: under
couerture of whom, to the view of the world: not but that I knew it, unworthy
of so high a personage, but rather that it needed the more noble patronage, the
less is in it to reco^mend it self, which how little it is, I am greatly in
fear Hereunto, my good Lord, I was the rather emboldened for your L. great
affection to this noble ^^ience, hoping for the one you might pardon (...)
other, and desirous to make known your inclination this way. For howsoever my
skill be nothing such, as in least part to express the dignity of the art,
yet this I am sure of, if grave auctors have rightly informed me, that the
wisest men as Pythagoras and Plato, have made it their study, and most
honorable persons as Hercules and Achilles, their earnest practice. Besides
this, my good Lord, I bear this conceit, that not only my self am vowed to
your commandment, but all that is in me is dedicated to your Lordships
service: so that, albeit I am unable to make show of my deuty in such sort, as
I wish: yet to transport to other, what I owe to your Lordship I demeed not to
sit with such a profession. Only if it shall please your honorable mind to
measure my deed by my desire, it may happily seem somewhat, which of it self
is less then nothing. Which beseeching your Lordship with all instancie, and
as before hoping, so now most humbly craving pardon of my presumption, I rest
in prayer for the preservation of your honor in long life, and great
happiness, in the one to match the oldest, in the other the blesseddest.

Your Lordships most bounden servant, and at all commandment most ready.
John Farmer.

Philomusicis.
Marvel not gentlemen, who soever shall see this little book, that Music
shows her self in this unusual vain. For if in other arts it be a common
practice (and yet not so ordinary as commendable) every way to devise to
further the study of each particular, why should Music be denied that, which
is granted the rest? Certes how men do think of her, I do not know (I doubt
but bassely) how they should I am out of doubt, that is most honorably. No
man can deny, but that God is author, as of all other excellent qualities, so
of this (for so even the Philosophers, who had not right knowledge of the
heavenly majesty, by instinct of nature did see and confess) and as of the
7. liberal sciences, which therefore have that name, because they are
befitting men of most free birth, she is one in number, so peradventure, nay,
without peradventure not the last, if not the first, in dignity: for delight
wonderful, for depth infinite, for commodity it may happily be doubted,
whether any more necessary. Were it not so, it had not been to write, which
Tullie writes truly of the country of Graecia, where being the fountain of
all learning, and the very seat of wisdom, sic Musici floruerunt, as he
says, vt omnes id discerent, nec, qui nesciebat, satis excultus doctrina
putaretur. In the same country Themistocles a Prince of Athens, for that at a
feast he refused to play on the Harp, an instrument at that time of highest
credit, although in other respects in a manner peerless, only for this
defect, was thought somewhat rude. The end of my speech and purpose is this,
that the science being so excellent, and yet so couldlie followed, every one
that knows any thing of her, should every way be doing for her advancement,
and such as are not, are greatly in her debt, such as are, are favorably to be
accepted, howsoever it be not each man's fate to perform what is singular. I
profess (if any less wise, then I could wish them, misconstrue my meaning) to
do nothing of ostentacion (for alas what is this, nay what have I in me,
whereof justly to bost?) I was in hope that students in this art, such as may
learn, as my self may, and have not yet proceeded so far as I have, might
find something here not unworthy their labor. If it so fall out, I shall be
glad, if otherwise, it was the error of mine opinion, which I desire may be
pardoned to my good will, so shall I endeavor my self to continue my poor
labors, without repentance for this I have done. Fare ye well.

John Farmer.

WHo so delights in Musickes skill
and thereof judges right,
May here perceive a strange devise
most plainly in his sight.
2
Two parts in one upon a ground
in number forty ways,
A thing most rare surpassing far
most songsters now a days.
3
If this in youth performed be
as plainly you may see,
What fruit hereafter may we hope
to have of such a tree.
4
As farmer good or busye be
still laboreth in the field
So does this Farmer that he may
to others much fruit yield.
5
Farewell with praise and good report
of those that know thy skill
What thou desernest in Musicks art
this book will witness still.
Richard Wilkinson.

Whether in Musickes praise to wright
In general, or of the skill,
That did conduct this auctors quill:
I fear I perch above my might.
2
Since then I can not, as I would,
I spare to do it as I can,
Least I do wrong both art and man,
Not giving either, as I should:
3
The rather, cause it is to well known,
What Music is without my pen,
And he, among the skillful men,
Wanting my praise, will work his own.
4
Only, for that I love not ill
The art it self, and arts man both,
To lend my hand I was not loath
Both ways to witness my good will.
