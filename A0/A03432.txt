To the right honorable and virtuous Lady, the Lady Marye Sydney, Geffraye
Fenton Wishes a happy increase of honor and years in this life.
NICEPHORVS an Historiographer of great creditt amongst the Greeks,
affirms, that as every knowledge of it self deserves commendacion, so the
discipline of histories is most agreeable and necessary for all ages, which the
Roman orator Marcus Cicero full well approves A witness or cronicler of times,
a ca^dle to the trothe, the life of the memory, the master of a man's life,
and the reaporter of all antiquityes.
in commending the study thereof to al degrees and times as an exercise of
most necessitye and honor, for that (says he) in them is represented (as yt
were) an image or pourtraict of all things that have passed since the
beginning of the world, to gether with diversity of instructions to all
sorts of people touching their direction in future chances even until the
last and extreme dissolucion of the same, not doutinge also in his first
book De oratore to add certain peculiar titles, calling an history testis
temporis, lux veritatis, vita memoriae, magistra vitae, and nuncia vetustatis:
For if a man be young says e. The reading thereof will make him old (not in
years, with the most part cold be content to shyfte of and forgo, but in
experience and wisdom, and if he be alredye laden with the heavy burden of
nature, what a pleasure is it then to behold the things which either he has
passed in youth, or long be fore his time were put in practice, whereof as the
first is veraye well proved by Euripides the Poett sainge that the remembrance
of the pain that his past is sweet so th'oppinion Iucundi. acti labores.
of TVLLYE (touching the other) persuades a great necessity to all degrees
to be preuye to the commodity of stories, for says he, to be ignorant in
things happened or thou waste borne, is as much to say as thou will be always
a child. There is required in all estates both a faith and Nescire quid
antequam natus sis acciderit est semper esse puerum
fear in God, and also an outward pollecie in wordly things whereof
(according to the philosophers) yt one is to be learned by perusinge the
scripture, and the other can not be gotten but by the assistance of histories,
who are the only and true tables whereon are drawn in perfect coollers, the
virtues and vices of every condition of man, both their florishynge time
whileste they embraced the first, and miserable fall, when they grew in delight
with the wickedness of the last: if a man be a magistrate or bear authority in
public affairs, what labor is better bestowed, then in searchinge the acts
of such as have supplied equal dignitye and place, to accomodate himself to
their virtues: and to the private person, antiquity gives choice of
admonicions, for obedience to his superiors, with charge to apply and employe
all his care for the commoditye of his countreye: if he be a citizen, he shall
there find what belongs to his proper office either in the service of his
public weal, or in his peculiar affairs at hoame. And to a woman, what
stoare of examples are there to instruct her in her duty, either for the
married, to keep her faith to her husband with LVCRETIA, or the unmarried to
defend her virginitye with virginya: fynallye that excellent treasore and full
librarye Lyuye.
of all knowledge yeldes us frelye presidentes for all cases that may happen,
both for imytacion of the good, Histories a library or store house of
knowledge
detestynge the wicked, avoiding a present mischief, and preuentyng any evil
before yt fall: wherein also as in every art there be certain special
principles and rules for the direction of such as search out their
disposition, so histories do swarm with examples of all kind of virtues,
wherein both the dignitye of virtue, and fowlenes of vice appears much more
lyuelye then in any moral teaching, saying therein is figured under certain
forms and shaps of men and their doyngs past, al and every such diuersitye and
change which philosophy does teach by way of precepts, like as also
(touching the commodityes to be coolled out of antiquityes) Lyuye is of
oppinyon, that the pleasure and proffitt falls out of indifferent value to
such as bestow their time with vprighte judgment in the view of ancient
records, for says he, nihil est aptius ad delectationem lectoris, quam
temporum varietates fortunaeque vicissitudines cognoscere, quae etsi
exoptabilia in experiendo non fueru^t tamen in legendo sunt iocunda, and the
fruit and chief gayns derived of such traueile is, in that we shall see set
furthe good and who alsome lessons of all sorts, whereof we may take to our
selves and benefyt of our countreye, such as we like to follow, and which
presents unto us the true picture and reapport of such enterprises, as had
both sinister begynnynges and much worse ends, and yet is yt not sufficient
for us to judge that the only fruit consistes in reading the noble acts of
good men, saying that (of the contrary) to those that study to resemble their
virtues, th'eschewynge of the evil parts in a number of vicious persons, is
a singular commoditye, which, if it were not so the continuance of so many
hundredth years in all common states as well heathen as Christened, had not
permitted the reading of sondrye Poets, whose commodies and tragedies importe
a description fyguratyue of the wicked lives of all degrees of men and women,
without intent to persuade any ymitation that way, but rather to provoke the
multitude by familyar trains to avoid such conditions as they saw justly
reprehended in others: And truly with better reason may a man put to the view
of the world any ancient reapport, whose profession is to declare a truth,
then to prefer the fained tales of Poets, which yet we see for diverse good
respects tolerated to be redd in all ages. For like as in a familye or
ancient house, who has been most renowned of all the stock, leaves a
president and desyer to his posteritye to resemble his doings, as a glass and
mirroir to them of most excellent virtues, so when histories are published to
the common proffyt of al men, every one goes about to confirm himself to
the virtuous conversation and life of such as excelled amongst the elders,
wherein me seameth Nycephorus said very well, that those which write
Histories, and keep not that which is profitable and praise worthy (as it
were) in their stoare house at hoame, but rather being benefyciall to the
common welthe, do expose so common a profitt to the general commodity of all
men, are (as it were) th'executours of Gods divine providence, because they
comprise and pack up in one work or volume (as in a common treasore, sondrye
sorts of noble deeds, without inhibition or let to any degree, to resort
thereunto, and learn by othermens misdeeds, to direct better his own doings,
and not with the exchange of the world to alter also his mind, but rather
as much as lies in him, to ymitate the life and conversation of them, who
have lived well before, wherein saying in this world the nature of man in all
ages, although the singler persons be changed, remeineth still one, so also
the good fortunes, felicities, calamities and miseries which happen both in
public government and to every private state, turn always to one effect
and are like those of times paste, so that by the benefyt of stories,
presentinge before our eyes a true kallender of things of ancient date, by the
commendacion of virtuous, and valiant persons and acts: we be drawn by
desyer to tread the stepps of their renown, and on the other side, considering
the sinister fortune and horrible cases, which have happened to certain
miserable souls, we behold both th'extreme points whereunto the frail
condition of man is subject by infirmity, and also are thereby toughte by the
view of other men's harms to eschew the like inconveniences in our selves:
wherein (right honorable) like as I have rather touched sleightelye, then used
terms of commendacion at large according to the worthynes of so precious a
Jewel as the knowledge of histories, for that now a days every man's mouth is
open to commend the fruit distilling from so florishynge a vine ^o for my
part, being more forward then hable to discharge my zeal in that behalf,
have bestowed some of my voyed hours whilst I was in the other sides the Sea,
in forcynge certain Tragical Discourses out of their French terms, into
our English phrase, presumyng to commend unto your Ladishypp the fruits and
effect of my travail, following therein the order of such as have spente
time in the like study, who are wounte to declare their good will, by
bestowynge their labors: wherewithe being vnhappelye denied other frendshypp
of fortune to make good my desyer in gyuing an unfeigned show of the duty and
service I owe you and the house whereof you took your beginning, am here
upon terms of humilitye for preferment of this rude and simple dedication of
these foreign reapportes to your honor, to whose virtues, as I have chiefelye
respected to give due renown, by preferrynge a true purtraict of your
conversation and life in the virtues gifts and ornaments of the noble
ANGELIQVA chaste PAROLYNA, constant IVLIA and renowned CARMOSYNA with others,
whose integretye of life has given them a crown of immortalitye, with a
glorious remembrance of their names for ever after their death, so my second
endeavor was bent to observe the necessity of the time, chiefly, for that upon
the view and examples of our Auncesters lives, the frail ympes of this age,
may find cause of shame in their own abuses, with desyer to exchange their
badd condition and order of living, with the study and desyer to ymitate the
virtue of their predecessors, whose life and renown after death, argues the
undoubted reward, at tendynge (as a thing of course) the virtuous and well
disposed, where of the contrary, appear wounderfull torments and sharpp
pennaunce provided to plage the abominable and vicious liver: Besides it is a
principle and chief rule in our nature and disposition to be rather
instructed by examples of familyar authorityes, then reformed by seueritye of
laws, for that the one seames to govern us by awe and commandment, and in
the other appears a consent of our fancy, marchinge always according to
the direction of our own wills, for which cause the Historians of old time
(in their several records of the acts, conquestes, and noble attemptes of
Princes and great men) have left out nothing serving for the ornamente and
institution of man's life, not forgetting to set out also in natural
coollers, their tyranny and other vices, with contempt of virtue, if their
lives were found guiltye in any such offense: But when they paynte out a
good king, a magistrate without touch of partial or covetous mind, a
courtyar loyal and without dissimulation, A minister of the Church not
smelling of hypocrysye, but searchynge purelye the honor of God, A Lady
chaste, honest, curteouse, a lover of charity, using a devout reverence to
God and fear to his laws, yt is then that they allure (by trains of
familyaritye) every succession to embrace and behold (as in a glass) the
undoubted mean that is hable and wylt bring them to the like perfection in
virtue, which also moved me to use a special discrecion in coollynge out
such examples as best aggreed with the condition of the time, and also were
of most fresh and famylyar memory, to the end that with the delight in
reading my dedication, I may also leave to all degrees, an appetitt and
honest desyere to honor virtue and hold vice in due detestation. And albeit
at the first sight these discourses may importe certain vanytyes or fond
practices in love, yet I doubt not to be absolved of such intent by the
judgment of the indifferent sort, saying I have rather noted diversity of
examples in sondrye young men and women, approuynge sufficientlye the
inconvenience happenynge by the pursuit of lycenceous desyer, then affected in
any sort such uncertain follyes: For hear may be seen such patterns
of chastetye, and maids so assured and constant in virtue, that they have not
doubted rather to reappose a felicitye in the extreme panges of death, then to
fall by any violent force into the danger of the fleshelye enemy to their
honor: In like sort appears here an experience of wounderfull virtues in
men, who albeit hadd power to use and command the thing they chieflye
desyered, yet (bridlynge with maine hand) The humor of their inordinate
lust, vanquished all mocions of sensualytye, and became masters of them
selves, by abstaynynge from that whereunto they felt provocation by nature:
who desyereth to see the follye of a foolish lover passionynge himself upon
creditt, the impudency of a maid or other woman renouncing the vow of her
faith or honor due to virginity, the sharpp penance attendynge the rash
choice of great Ladies in seekynge to match in any sort with degrees of
inferior condition: or who wishes to be privy to th'inconueniences in love,
how he frieth in the flame of the first affection, and after grows not
only cold of himself, but is easelye converted into a contrary shapp and
disposition of deadlye hate, may be hear assisted with more then double
expeperience touching all those evils: the courtesy of an enemy on the
behalf of his aduersarye, with a wounderfull lyberalitye in the other in
retournynge the benefytt received, is hear set furthe in fuche lyuelye
coollers, that there seames to lack nothing for the ornament and decoracion
of such a wooke. And who takes pleasure to behold the fyttes and panges of a
frantique man incensed to synister conceits by the suggestion of frettynge
Ielouzye, forcynge him to effects of absolute desperation, The due plage of
disloyaltye in both kinds, with the glory of him who marches under the
enseigne of a contrary virtue, a man of the church of dissolute living
punished with public reproach, or the villenie of the greedye usurer making no
conscience to prefer oppen perjury in suppressynge the innocent cause, may
find here to satisfye his longing at full, neither do I think that our
English records are hable to yield at this day, a Romant more delicat and
chaste, treating of the veraye theme and effects of love, then these
hystories, of no less credit then sufficient authority, by reason the most
of them were within the compass of memory, wherein as I wish the torments
that pinched here such as labored in a passion of follye and fond desyer,
may work a terror to all those that hereafter vnhappelye Syp of the cupp of
such ragynge infection, so touching the commendable parts of any Lady or
woman of meaner condition, mentioned in this volume of discourses, I find
them far to light to keep wayghte with the balance, wherein are paised the
qualityes of your honor, which seame to have a certain affinitye and
resemblance with such as were the very vertuse and causes of commendacion in
any that ever deserved the title of most perfect or iustyle renowned: For if
ever the ^uene of Carya was meritorious for her magnanimytye and bountiful
disposition, the queen of Saba which some writers call Nycaula, and other Man*
quedae, was had in honor for her wisdom, which was such that both the old
and new testament affirm, that she traueled from the end of the world and
extreme confynes of the land of Iud^^, to come and hear the doctrine of
Solomon, with whom she disputed no less learnedly then with profo^de
judgment, or if the constant Lady Blaudina a Christian borne in the heart of
Europe has purchassed chassed a crown of eternetye, in kepinge her faith and
vow to God and the world even to the last seperacion of Executed for
religion in France by the Emperor Seuerus in the year. 178.
her soul and body, or if any other, either of antiquitye or familyar
experience, of what degree and condition so ever, have been noted of renown
for the gift of nobilitye in any sort, your Ladishipp may boldelye challenge
place with the best, either for moderate government, whose effects in all
things you attempt, argue your worthy participacion with the excellent
gifts of temperance and wonderful modesty in, the tj. most famous Earls of
leicester and Warwike your brotherne, and most virtuous and renowned Lady the
Countess of Huntington your sister, to whose glory and general love amongst
all sorts of people in this land, I need not add further circumstance or
increase if praise, considering the whole state, fixinge their eyes upon
them with an unfeigned zeal and admiracion of their wisdom and virtues, do
aduouche in more ample sort their good will that way, then I am either
worthy or hable to declare. And for your clemency to the case of
the afflicted, vprighte dealing without exaction or cause of grudge to any,
wonderful respect to the honor of your calling, with dutyfull awe and fear
of Godd, and obedience to my Lord your husband, or other arguments or effects,
wherein consistes the praise of a virtuous mind, or ought to appear the fruits
of true nobility, they make you not so much honored in your contreye, as
embrased of strangers, who never saw nor knew you but by name, who also
doubt not to make your sincere and devout order of living, a lookyng glass
to behold and follow your virtues, and by your order of doing, to draw the
plat and foundation of their own life, which shall suffice for this time (good
madam) for the commendacion of that, which is sufficiently perfect of it self,
and so generally honored of all degrees, that it need not th'assista^ce of any
peculiar praise: hu^blie craving for my part a privilege of favor at your
hands so farfurthe, as it may be lawful for me to lay these first fruits
of my travel upon the alter alredye garnished with other oblacions of your
everlasting glory as a remembrance of an humble sacrifice, which, I make of
my little labor and contynuall service vowed to your Ladishipp so long as God
and nature will allow my abode in this miserable vale: at my chamber at Paris,

Sir John Conway Knight to the readers in praise of the Translator.
LIke as the slender be, by travail in her kind
Collects her fruit, the sugared sap whereof we daily find.
So hear my learned friend, in nature like the be:
Has linckt his labor to his art, and yeldes the fruit to the,
In tongue estraungd from us, whiles this succedynge work,
(As does the honye in the flower) by covert mean did lurk,
He laboring with effect, has by his learned pain,
Enforst a French man tell his tale, in English language plain.
Not for him self: thou know, it answered his delyght,
By skyll to understand the tale, as did the Aucthor write.
But toylynge for thy sake, has fourmd his hyue full fine,
Take thou the comb, the pain was his, the honye shall be thine.
Good reader yet beware, least Spyder like thou take
By cancred kind a spightfull stynge, whence he did honye make.
Let not in lewe of pain, a tongue complete with spyte,
Attempt to harm (though power shall want) the thing that he does writ
For if thou do: the wies, will feel thy festred kind,
And he to whom thou do such wrong shall so thy nature find.
No doubt our days are such, as every man can see
And can at ease, and will perceive, the spider from the Be.
Allow his labor then and work that well is done:
And thou shall see thee golden race his muse pretends to roon.
Let ZOILVS suck the teate, that Envy holds in hell,
And say with me God speed the pen, that has begone so well
Thus has he his desire, thus shall thou live in rest
Thus shall his frynds have at thy hands the sum of their request.

Amici cuiusdam, ad Authorem Carmen Hexametrum.
FLoruit antiquo Galfridus tempore Chaucer
Scripsit and eximio permagna volumina versu
Et multi viguere viri, quos vnica virtus,
Nefandos facile effecit tolerare labores.
Vixerunt: and sola manet, nunc fama Sepultis
At tua nunc primum, (Galfride) virescere virtus
Incipit, and teneras cum spe producere plantas:
Quae (scio) quam primumradices caeperit altos,
Efferet egregios cum magno foenore, fructus.
Ergo quisquis erit, qui forte reuoluerit ista,
(Cuius men's liuore nequit nec amore moueri,
Et sapit) haud dubito, quin te dignabitur illa
Laud, tuo quam tu magno sudore parasti.
Sin minus: hoc vno tibi sat (Fentone) tulisti,
Quod Domina est cui des, dono dignissima tanto.

George Turberuille in praise of the translator of this book.
IF handycraftesmen have great praise for working well
By toyling trade the trifling wares which they for money sell:
Then why should Fenton fear to purchase praise of men,
To whom he fra^ckely gyues the gift of this his pleasant pen?
If he his busye browe have beat for our avail,
And for our pleasure taken pains, why should his guerdon fail?
No gredye golden fee, no Iem or Jewel brave,
But of the reader good report this writer longes to have.
No man of meanest wit, no beast of slender brain
That thinckes that such a volume great is wrought with slender pain.
The thing it self declares what toil he undertook,
Ere Fentons curious fyle could frame this passing pleasant book.
The French to English phrase, (his mother language) he,
The darcke to light, the shade to son, has brought as you may see.
The learned stories erste, and sugared tales that lay
Remoude from simple common sense, this writer does displaye:
And what before he took his painful quyll to write
Did lurcke unknown, is playnelie now to be disternd in sight.
Now men of meanest skill what Bandel wrought may view,
And tell the tale in English well that erst they never knew,
Discourse of sundry strange and Tragical affairs,
Of loving Ladies haples haps, their deaths, ad deadly cares,
And diverse things beside, whereby to flee the darte
Of vile deceytefull Cupids bow that wounds the lovers heart.
Since this by Fentons mean, and travail thou doct gain,
(Good reader) yield him earned praise and thanckes for taken pain.
Then I that made this verse shall think as well of the
As Fentons work does well deserve accounted of to be.
PETER BEVERLEY IN PRAISE of the translator.
RYfe is the rule that blames the Idell mind
The ground as great that blaseth travels gain
Each tongue can tell a world of vices kind
And Scacred lines appoints offenses pain
But Fenton shows in svvete and sugared style
What pleasant bayte does each state beguile,
What careless youth that sees the toylyng Ant
But shames to wear his goulden time in vain
Whose tender lymmes in summer time do haunt
The frutfull felds to rest in Borias Rain
When she does suck the svvete of, heruest toil,
And fynds in frost relefe in dried soil.
The slender store that sum do now possess
Whose idell boones did loath in youth the lode
To those that live suffyseth to express
The loytring child in age knovves no abode
But as the ship tossed with the byllovv great
So he does yield him self to fortunes threte.
What pride deserves, what is black hatreds hiere
What envy, theft, what is the mysers mede
In fine what foul offense what fact so dire
But scripture shows his rights if thou list read
VVherby each may both shun the vilest sin
And learn such life as lasting Joy does win.
But Fentons frame has woven an other vvebbe
His paynfull penn has died a stranger hevve
He tells when wit is in his lowest ebb
And vvarns the Shun the bayne that coms by vievve
Which so does change the sense of every vvight
That from a man to beast it tournes him quitt.
As when the mind through want of reasons rain
Unbridled yelds to fond affections force
And feding still the heart with amors vain
Convert each part unto a sencles cors,
VVherin he lives so odd from right and law
As mountayn bear, that prays deuoyd of awe.
And subject thus unto svvete folyes lore
If vvishe he win, he shows what sour svvete
The pacient suckes, what bitter bliss in store,
He heaps, when age with judgment just shall mete
When proof shall say, of all vnhappyest vvight
That reapest care in lyevv of hopte delight.
But if disdain shall quyt him with dispyght
And yield him loath, for long desired grace
Then stabbing glayue the desperate breast must smite
Or frantycke wise run out a savage race,
Thus if of gladd or sad he happ the gain
Both have this end, in love naught is but vain.
Which reckles race to bring in wisdoms guide,
And for to rain with bytt of better skill
My paynfull friend did this discourse provide
As brake to break affections lavvles will
Give Fenton then but freuts of his desert
And gather thou that best may please thy heart.
P. B.

The argument
I Mean nothere to increase the merueile of men, with a particular
description of the sumptuous buildinges of Princes, the magnificall scites and
scituations of great men's houses, nor restore to memory the wounderfull
pollecies and artificial devises of our Auncestoures in making plats and
firm fondacions of Castles and Cities in the bottom of the sea, and much
less trouble you with a reaporte of their ingenious trauaill in castinge
down hills, and making Craggy mountains flat with the face of the earth, or
forcing stony Rocks, Hannyball forced a passage for his armi through the
Alps.
with places here to fore impassible, to oppen and make way to their huge
armies, but I have in present intent to discover unto you the meruellous
effects of love, which exceeding the opynion of common things, seames more
strange, then the curious construction and frame of any Pallais for necessity
or pleasure, threatrie or place of solace builded by art or industry of man,
or other stately Court what sqware, quadrante, or triangle form so ever it
conteines, or other mystical work yeldinge cause of wonder to the university
of the earth, seeing that a mortal grudge grounded upon great spite,
confirmed with the continuance of a long time, and pursued extremelye with
bloddye persecution and unnatural cruelty, is not only converted upon a
sudden into perfect frendeshippe, but also by an effect and operation of
love, made so indissoluble that no future accidente or synister devise of
enemies, could once make a breach, and much less utterly dissolve the league
of amity so happily begone and sewerly knite together by the virtue of
affection, which we call commonly the passion procured by love, whereunto is
also added alike effect of a thankful mind, arguing unto us (whythe a
famyliar example) that as ingratitude, is the greatest vice ye raynes in the
disposition of man, and Ingratitude the chiefeste ennemy: to the honor of
nobilitye
principal ennemy to the honor of nobility, so the contrary, deserves by
justice the title of the most precious virtue yt is, wherein as the Thebans,
were shamefully reproched, for the respect of their great Capttaines Epaimy
nondes, and Pelopides, so the Plateons (on the contrary) were worthily
renoun^ed for the large recompense and consideracion they used, to the benefyte
of the Greeks who delivered them from the servitude of the Persians, like as
also the Sycyoniens wear yet the crown of eternal, comendacion, for the
thankful return of the curtesye of Aratus by whom they were frankely taken
out of the hands of cruel tyrants: if the act of Philip Marya. late Duke
of Myllan deserves detestacion for the unnatural crueltye he committed upon
the person of his wife, who albeit was equal in nobility, exceded him in the
gifts of fortune and large possessions, of indifferente beaw tie to content a
reasonable man, nothing inferior to the best Lady of the country in
thornaments of nature, and gifts of grace, and yelding him besides such honor
and honest love as was necessary for the state of marriage, yet notwithstanding
was he so unthankful to all these benefits, that after he had called the
flower of her beautye, and forced her to pass an assurance of her goods and
lynynge to his use; he committed secret execution and washed his hands in the
blod, of th^infortunate Lady, contrary to all ciuilytie or law of nature, if
he (I say) seame justly meritorious of reproach, we may worthily imparte
treble praise to a barbarous Turk and admiral of the country of Arabia, who
being overthrown in ye bataile foughten in that country, by Bandwin king of
Jerusalem, him self and wife prisoners, with his treasure and municion of
war at the disposition of the said king, and being, dismissed freely
without exaction or raunsom, and his wife restored without violacion, or force
of her body, judged it a virtue not to be overcome in magnificence and
liberalitye, and a mortal vice to bear the title of an unthankful Prince,
whereof he made declaracion for that not long after the said Bawdwine, being
beseged of the infidels, and by distress of war, at point to fall into their
mercy the said admyral, not vumindefull of the compassion he showed upon his
misery, brake into him by night and with certain assistantes of horsemen,
prevented his present peril, and set him safelye upon his way from al offer
or fear of danger. All which I have coated in this introduction, for that my
historye importes ii, examples of semblable substance, the one exposinge a
wonderful effect of frendshipp on the behalf of his ennemie, and the other
retorninge his liberalitye, with such ample consideration, that there is no
degree in any Corner ofchristendom-but may se an experience of virtue in the
doings of the^ both. Wherein I wish chiefly a perticipacion of the fruit of
such examples to all sorts of our contriemen in england, to the end we may
form our lives upon ye verteous presedents of such strangers as preferringe
virtue before vice, have been more curious to get a true renoume of reputacion,
then careful of a vain gloriouse or folyshe pomppe of the world.

A WONDERFVL Virtue in a gentlman of Syenna on the behalf of his enemy, who^
he delivered from Death, and the other to return his courtesye with equal
frendshyp, presented him with his sister whom he knew he loved entierlye.
IN the ^ecewles or Comentories of tuskan I find a special Remembrance of a
mortal grudge between ij of the most noble houses in SYENNA called Salimbino
and Montanino, whereof as both the one and other were of semblable Reputation
for honor and height of estate, so were they of equal Rule and authority in
the government of their public weal, whose parents allbeit and
predecessors were of singler commendation by the virtue of mutual societye
which appeared so entyer and indissoluble between them by many discentes,
that the writers in that age douted not to term them no less true myrrroers
and patterns of perfect friendship then either HORESTES or PYLLADAS which ye
Romain orator Makes so famous by peculiar commendation, yet according to the
opinion of Aristotle, as children Children do commonly rather excede their
fathers in vice, then resemble them in ver(...)*
commonly do Rather excede their fathers in vice, then Resemble them in virtue,
so the posteretyes of these noble houses, in place to persevere in the virtue of
their parents, or tread in the steps of their aunciente amytie, in the
very entrey of their flourishing time, when al men were in exspectacion of
verteous fruits like to their fathers with hope to confirm the league of
their long frendeshippe, they embrased sinister occasions of civil mutines,

which with the heat of the wine wherein they goolled without regard after
their trauaill, and the bloudde being chaffed with the press and number of
terms of reproach, bolked out at last to cruel blows, which (without
respect of persons) seamed so to occupye the place for the time, that besides
a number that were hurt on both parts, the SALIMBINS had the worste, for
that one of their chief was left for dead in the field, where with the fraye
discontinued for that time, and every man retired, the MONTANINS not gladd of
the victory for that theye doubted a revenge, and the SALIMBINS contented by
force with their present fortune, attendynge notwithstanding thassistaunce of
a better time to redeem the blood of their kynsman, not with equal loss of
their enemy, but with utter ruin and subversion of the whole house of their
adverse part, which they failed not accordingly to perform with such hoate
expedicion and power, that after diverse public skermishes and private
combats, with indecent murders, (the contrary part having consumed the most
part of their rent and reuenewe in meintainynge garrisons to withstand their
malice, within the compass of no long time) they hadd brought to extreme
depopulatio^ the whole kindred of the MONTANINS, except one young Gentleman
named CHARLES, who finding himself to weak to resyste any longer the rage of
his adversaries, retired to a contentement by force and gave place to their
fury, and they also finding the field abandonned without any to make head
against them, dismissed their angrye humor, and laid aside their bluddye
weapons being dolled with the heavy and mortal blows upon their conquered
enemies. This Charles and last remainder of the house of MONTANINO, being
appointed by destenie to live yet in spite of his enemies, stirred not out of
the town of SIENNA, where as a solitary man in the press of his adversaries,
he lived, without either salutyng or hauntynge the place of their repair,

goodness of so great a gift, may be satisfied by the present of proffe this
Angeliqua, who so fedd the ears of the city with the general Brute and
co^mendacion of her virtue, that in one moment, he which erst was chief and
captain of the war against them, and seamed invincible against, all the
aid and assistaunce they could procure, is now become a slave and most
subject to the view and contemplation of her beauty, in such sort, as by
little and little, he grew into terms of extreme affection and undoubted zeal
toward her whose name he hated erst, no less then the Cankered styng of the
cruel Cockatrice, wherein as the humor of his love seamed to excede the
ordinary impressions of men in that case: So he neither was hable to resist
the hoate sommaunce of his new appetit, nor keep war any time with the
suggestion of his sudden desire, but as one that felt himself stricken with
the thonderbolt of his destynie, gave place to his sentence, and entered into
devise with himself, what way too use, to win the encounter of his fancy.
The remembrance of the late wrong he had done them, seamed a great
impediment to his purpose, neither had he the mean to demand her in marriage,
Whose tears were skarce dry in bewailyng the desolation he hadd so lately
thondred upon al their house, the simple view and record whereof, preferred
just cause of despair to obtain the good will of her brother, wherewith feling
a daily increase of his passion, with continual diminution and vnlikelyhod of
means to releue his torment, specialy, for that he had imprisoned his liberty,
where no ransom could serve to redeem it, and that love had bound him to so
hard a pennaunce, that the only pleasure he had in life, was to think upon
her, whom despair denied him to reclaim by any means, he began to curse
thee first cause of the quarrel, and wyshe the huntyng of the boar hadd never
ben tolerable in Italy, inueighyng withal against the malice of his fortune,
that seamed to be his guide in the pursuete of so great persecution, and now in
the hope and expectation of rest and repose from toil, to committ him to the
mercy of a martyrdom more intolerable then the torment of the whele, and of
less hope to be delivered, the^ the Damned souls out of theuerlasting flame

upon double terms, both for yt he durst neither discover his disease to any
his own trendes, whom he knew would rather mislike his request, then be
moved to compassion upon his case, or study to releue his distress, nor
promise himself any likelihod and much less assurance ever to cooll either
flower or fruit of his affection to Angeliqua, for that he thought she had no
reason to remorse upon him, in whose face appeared yet the fresh Remembrance
of the late revenge and destruction of her kynsmenne.

any expedition without his company, and yet upon a sudden and without any

in presence and by commau^deme^t of him whom he had so faithfully honored and

wherein also (when thoccasion does offer) you may note a verefication or like
accident in the sequeill of this MONTANYNO, who after the depopulation of his
house by civil war, and the most part of his porc ion wasted in the supplye
of that quarrel, fell into a misery more tragical then the other, and of less
hope of aid or delyuerye, and yet being passed thextreme sommonce of his
fortune, and attendynge the fatal and last momente of execution, after he had
dismissed all exspectation of succoure, his deliverance appeared by him that
procured and pursewed his distress, and the same miserye that first moved his
ruin, reserved such a virtue in the end of his tragedye, that by thonly
assistance of him, whom he thought to have sworn his destruction, he was
restored with more assurance and co^tentement of mind then before: but now to
our amarous SALIMBINO who tossed in the stormye sea of his unquiet thoughts,

as he suffered himself at the first to be subject to the somonce of love, and
gave him preu iledg with out resistance to build his bower in the bottom of

himself lord over al ye ports in him, he is bound to bear ye yoke of

fate are forced to pass throw the miserye of such doleful traunces, so, as
he attended in this sort the gift of a better occasion, behold thapproch of
the second desaster or tragedye of the unhappy MONTANINO. For within the City
of SYENNA dwelte a long nosed marchaunte, who for the most part as they be
more gredy to get, then worthy of that which they have, so do they seldom or
never respect the mean, so they may finger that which they wish. He had
joining to the vttermoste subburbes of the city a fair house environed with
large demaines, where upon confyned on al parts certain pieces of ground of
the said MONTANYNO, which with a bare house in the town, as it was al yt the
malice of his fortune had left him of the ample patrymonye of his parents, So
this hungrye burgeys, thinkinge it no offense or grudge of conscience, to
enlarge his lyuinge with the portion of his neighbor, knowinge well enoughe,
that after so many occasions of great expenses, he was not only in distress
for monye but wanted other necessary furniture, sent his broaker to boarde him
for the sale of his lands in ye country, with commission to give him a
thousand Ducats for those grounds which joined to his lordshippe without the
subberbes, wherein his request was frustrate and he out of hope that way to win
theffect of his desyer, for that CHARLES, was resolved to make store of those
grounds above the rest of that little that was left him, chefly for that
besides they were percell of thauncient possessions of his parents, yet he
reserved a spicial zeal to those lands, because the view of them restored a
fresh remembrance of such as in maney ages before had borne the grertest
swaighe in that public weal, wherwyth the coue tus villayne not content with
the reasonable denial of the gentleman, did not imediatlye dismiss his desire
to get that which he ought not to have wished, but determined not only to win
it by vonderly means, but also for reueng of ye plain Answer of the MONTANYN
entered into devise to subborne some means to have it at a less price, and not
without the hazard and peril of the lif of ye pore gentilman, followinge
therein the detestable example of thiniuste Iesabell, who procured the death of
Naboothe, to the end she might enjoy his possession, wherein he was furthered
every way, but chiefly with the assistance of the time. For at the same
instaunte, by reason of the mutual quarrels and civil dyscentions that reigned
long before in the most parts of Italye, most of the nobility were driven
the country, and those few that remained, lived not only under the awe of
Townclarks and Catchepowles chosen by the rural crew, but also had small
assurance of sauetye, in their towns or Cities, where for the more subjection
and awe of the Gentlemen, this villainous sect of cursed caterpillars made a
law, not much unlike the tyrannous statute which the Athenians had in the
time of solon, that no man of what degree or condition so ever he were,
should neither by himself, nor procurement of any other, go about to
purchasse the reappeale or restitution An ungodly Law.
of any that were banished their countreye, upon pain to yield to the fyske a
thousand florentes, with addicion, that if he were not hable to answer the
condemnacion within ten days, to loase his head in remembrance of ye forfeyte:
who marks well the misterye of this law, may easily judge the viperus
meaning of those wretches, who rather resemble the barbarous tirants and
infidels without faith, then seame to have the hearts of true Christians, and
happy is he that is not borne under the gouernemente of such a state, where
they do not only shut the gates of compassion against their innocente
neighbors and friends, haba^doned their country for peculiar grudges one
against an other, but also punished by an unnatural crueltye the virtue of
such as seek to supply the affliction of them that ought to be of equal
regard and honor to the best of them, and besides that this oppressor of
innocents was both one of ye law makers, and chief minister and commander
of the same, yet was he sewer of a second assistaunce which seamed no less
auailable to him then the advantage of his power or authority, wherefore
dispencinge with no time in the execution of his deuelish devise, he somoned
Don CHARLES by write to appear before the Senate, where was laid before him the
breach of the said law, and for a more proof or plains of yt matter,
thaccusacion was no sooner published then he had at his elbowe double choice
of perjured witnesses, who what by the awe of his authority, and thinfecting
somonce of certain pieces of gold, wherewith he had fyled their tongues before,
aduouched thappeale by oath, deposinge further that they knew where he had
solicited to redeem diverse of his banished friends, seking to supplant the
state of the city by restoring the nobles and gentlemen to their ancient rule
and authority which made ye pore Montanyn in such double amaze of doubt and
fear, that he was not only void of council for the present, but in despair to
defend his right against the malice of the whole state, chiefly for that the
procurer of the fyske smelling thapproche of so great again, awarded
authorities to arrest his body to prison, and pursued his process with such
expedicion that within.vj. days he was condemned upon the statute of
rappeale, and to pay the forfait within.ix. days after, or else to leave his
head in pawn of the payment, the law imported such rigor that there was no
place for mediacion or suit of intreatye, and the ears of the justice were
closed against the complaint of innocents, neither durst any man inueighe on
his behalf for fear of him that was thauthor of thact, and the aid of
kynsmen is as cold in that country as in other places, and friends now a
days resemble the raven or hungry kyte, who never flies but toward the
place where they hope to find some thing to pray upon, so the friends of our
age be fled so far from the virtue of true fre^dshipp, that they will not only
refuse to releue him whom God and nature has bound them to sustain, but
also make no conscience to disclaim the name of a kinsman to the nearest allye
they have, and that without any cause unless you will impute it to the want of
equal welthe, wherein mine own experience moves me to make a challenge to
some in England, if my power were as indifferent to plead with him, as I have
just reason to put him in remembrance of his fault, albeit that quarrels is
tolerable which marches under the flagge of innocence and truth, and just
objections will make the guilty blushe, but now to the sorrowful MONTANYN who
complayninge the points of his desaster in a dark prison where was no kind of
consolation, nor yet the offer of any ECHO to resounde his dolorous cries, was
saluted the next day with a copye of his sentence diffinitiue, wherein he was
taxed to the some of a M. Florents or loss of life within ix. days, here he
found what it is to have an evil neighbor, and how greatly they do thurst
that destere to drink of an other man's cupp, but chieflye the insatiable
longyng of such as are with child for an other man's living: and albeit his
conscience was without grudge for any offense or breach of the law yet his
grief seamed of hard tolleracion because the cursed trayson of a Cankard
Clowen should tryumphe over him so far, that to quench the glot of his
covetous rage he should be forced to disinherite himself, and leave without
succor his dear sister, who for her part was so dolorous on the behalf of
this new desaster fallen upon her brother that she sturred not out of her
chamber, nor once suffered her eyes to be dry from tears, since the first
news of that sorrowful accident, which she complained with more vehemence
because she saw a present approach of perentory destruction to the little
remeinder of the whole house, alas says she, is the crueltye of fortune of
such rigorous condition or her malice of such perpetuitye that she will
grant no dispense nor admit any oblacion or offer to purchasse her favor, or
is there no sacrafice to satisfye the angry disposition of the heavens, who
cease not to thonder whole millions of mishappes upon this desolate and
wretched house of ours, with continuance of their angrye regards even until
thutter dissolution of the same? how much better had it ben for us few which
remain of the dekayed stock and withered generation of MONTANYNO, to have
passed amongst the rest of our companions, by the edge of the sword of the
enemy, then in living, to be miserable partakers of the unjust malice of
such as are not only common enemies to innocence, but bearing a natural
grudge to the very remembrance and name of nobility, do hunt with open mouth
(as the rauenyng wolf) to devour the discents of noble kind: how can this
bear the name of a free city, or justly merit the title of a state not
incident to servile law, where the government passes under the conueyghe of
a confused multitude, whom nature has ordained to draw the yoke of other
men's awe, and law of kind in their nativity framed to be subject to such,
as their rural force constraines to stoop to the sentence of their dome. Ah
brother says she with a fresh supplye of sorrowful tears, how rightely can
I conster the cause of thy present trouble, and indifferent undoing of us
both, the example of thy wrong argues sufficiently the detestable disposition
of our cursed Senators, who seame more gredye to hunte the chasse of unlawful
and filthy gain, then careful to keep their conscience without spott or
grudge of manifest oppression and wrong? for if the desire of thy little
living in the country, and glisteringe show of thy great house in the open
gaze and eye of the whole world passing by the streets had not sturred up the
covetous humor of that rauenouse marchaunte, thou had lived free from care,
and thy estate far from any question in the SENATE house, neither would any
man have charged thee with imputacion of a thing, which I would to God thou
had not only undertaken, but also brought to effect, to the end thou
might have been the author and I the witness of the just revenge of this
villainous crew whose natural malice more then either reason or justice does
clogge the with this hard imposition of manifest wrong: there is no reason
that a peltynge merchant never norished in any skole of cyuill or courteous
education other then in a shop amongst prentises and companions of his own
calibre, or the son of him that is a slave and servile borne by kind, should
either bear office in a common welthe, and much less sytte in judgment of
them whose hearts by nature abhores to be tried by the BARBAROVS voice of so
vile and base people, oh how happy be these states and contreys, where hynges
give laws, and princes use respect of favor to such as resemble them in
condition and virtue: neither has he great cause to grudge with his dome,
that has his cause debated in the presence of his prince, and his sentence
published by such as be of equal honor and Reputatyon, where we alas may
iustlye exclaim against our cursed constellacion, that has brought us
forth in so unhappy a time, and made us not only incident, but subject and
slaves to a council more peruerst and partial then corrupcion it self. I
would our predecessors or some good fortune of foreign time by reducy nge
this country into a Monarke, had established a seat Royal of a King with
authorititye that only his seed and succession should govern the whole*
rather then by leaving it thus dispersed into diverse co^fuced liberties, to
make us a mutual pray one to an other: for have we not the Frenchemen at our
backs? and the army of the great Uicare of Rome one the one side with the
subtle Florentins ready to invade us on the other side, in such sort, as who
so is hongry may boldly pray upon us without resistaunce, and yet for a more
increase of our wrechednes we maintain war with our selves, and the best
part subdued and made thrall to such as are not worthy any way to be vallet
to the worste of us that feles our selves grieved with such affliction, but
what can satisfy ye covetousness of man, or what benefit can stay him that is
given to perfidie or falsehod, and to what end alas serve my tears or tunes
of dolorous exclamacio^, if not in recordyng the circunstaunce of our mutual
grief, to restore a fresh remembrance of thy peculyar desaster, oh dear
brother, whose destinies I see will not dismiss the rigor of their dome till
they have brought us both to the brinke of extreme subuercion, albeit if the
offer of my body in sacrifice, or other mortal execution, would serve to
redeem thy liberty, and preserve thy possession in entier, assure thy self
that thy pore ANGELIQVA would be no less ready to make exchange of her life
for the raunsom of thy contentement and quiet, then these wide mowthed Rokes do
seek and gape to devour thy honor and living. And as the dolorous Lady was
thus in torments of dule with more passion on ye behalf of her brother, the^
care any way for her self, yt pore Montanine sta^di^g between a hard se^te^ce
and a most unhappy fortune, considered the last day of fatal respit to draw
fast to his date, and having no choice of means to mode ^at ye rigor of the
law, but by satisfying the whole demand of the fiske, which also he was not
hable to leuye by any credit or assistaunce of his friends, reposed his last

prolonge it to the last hour, so according to the extreme condition of his
present case, he resolved to employe the price of his lyuinge in the raunsom of
his present trouble, wheruppon he dispatched immediatlye one of the sergeantes
or officers of the gaile, to the corrupt money master, that was first and all
the cause of his undeserved mischief, with commission to conclude the bargain
for a thousand Ducats according to the rate of his first offer But the
traitorous wretch and pernicious pattern of iniquity, knowinge the extreme

more likelihode to sink, then assurance to recover the fyrme land, thought
that his death, would deliver him free possession of his lyuinge, without
thassistaunce of money, wherefore triumphyng already in the glory of so great
a fortune, with exspectation to have the land by special awarde of the fiske
and SENATE, returned the messenger with answer, that albeit of ^ate he had
desire to enlarge his demayne in the subberbe with a piece of his possession
adioynynge, yet upon a further view and consideration of the ground, he was
now of mind that his price far exceded the vaiewe, neither could he make so
present a proffit upon so small a plat of inheritance, as with the use and
interest of so great a sum of money as a M. ducats, notwithstanding for a
supply of his present need, he was contented to give him vij.C. flore^ts and
that more for the relief of his distress, then any respect of commodity by
the bargain. Here may be noted the virtue and operacion of the covetous mind
infected with the desyer of fylthie gain, whose fruits are to thirst after
other men's goods, and glory in the dekaye of their neighbor, with a
disposition to convert ye vngracions spoils of their brethren into a pleasant
pray to their ravening appetite, without regard notwithstanding to thexpress
inhibicion of God in diverse places of the Scripture, or respect to the duty
of his conscience, or burden of his soul, wherein besides ye peynall threats
of our Savior in the world to come, he seames also to hyer a tormentor to
molest his quiet during his abode here, for the more he is in The covetous

man takes more revenge of himself being on live, then h is enemy when he is

of threasor, nor yeldes charity to any but his golden coffers, whom he will
not deffraye nor once deminishe of a simple denier if it were to redeem the
life of his natural father, you have hard his former offer of a thousand

Florents, attending a further benefyt by the death of the unfortunate
MONTANIN, who no less astonyed at the reaport of this resolucion and refusal
not looked for, then when the judge published the sentence of his condemnacion,
began to despair of other refuge, chiefly for that the awe and respect of
authority of that villain prevailed so much over the rest of the merchants
and cytizens thear, that none other durst undertake the bargain, seeing their
master usurer made difficulty to advance ye value: such were the dispites of
his fortune and extreme terms which sinister fate, with the malice of the
wicked had brought him unto, wherein dismissing thexspectacion of all succors,
gave sentence of his own life and committed thexecution to the rigor of ye
law, resolving rather to quench thinsatiable thrust or gredye appetit of his
covetous enemy by thoblacion of his innocent life into thandes of such
unrighteous judges, the^ in exchaunging the remeinder of his whole inheritance

thinnocencye of his cause at the hands of the high judge, chiefly for that
the natural course of his days stood at point to be abridged by the wickedness
of other men, after he had preferred certain vehement inuectiues against the
general malice of the world, with special exclamacion on the behalf of his
peculiar myshap, he desired respite to examine his life in secret, and dispose
for the health of his soul, which resolucio^, of death was furthwith imparted
to the fair ANGILIQVA, who besides whole rivers of tears distilling from her
watery eyes, with dollorous cries in doleful voice, redoubled with an ECHO of
treble dule, entered into a mortal war with her garments and attire of her
head, neither forbearing to descheuel her crispy locks and hear exceeding the
collor of Am ber, nor commit cruel execution upon the tender parts of her
body, and giving free spoke to ye humor of her fury, she spared not to imprint
with her nails upon the precious complexion of her orient face, a pytifull
remembrance of the tragical troble of her desolate brother, whom she could
not any way persuade to a chaung or alteracion of purpose, although she
employed herself and council of her friends to thuttermoste, but I dare
avouch thusmuche on the behalf of the dear zeal she bare him, that if by the
force and malice of the distress, he had given place to nature and dyed she
had not lived to have revenged his wrong, nor lamented her own desolacion,
for the same affection which moved her to such care of his life, would also
have procured her to have been his companion to the grave, whereby one tomb at
one instaunt should have served to shroode the ij. bodies and last remaynder of
the whole race and house of the MONTANYNS. And that which scamed to restore her
dollorous passion, with a fresh supply and increase of new sorrow, was the
heavy news of diverse of her near kynsmen touching the spedy approach of the
extreme date and delay of the sentence diffinitiue, which as they had not only
endeavored to differ yet some longer time, but also to purchase a moderation of
the rigor, so being no less frustrate in the one, then voyed of assurance or
hope of the other, they said there rested nothing on their powers to perform
or discharge the office of true friends on her behalf, saving to persuade her to
consolacion, and to use patience in cases of adversity, chiefly where there
appears absolute despair of all remedy, and the sinister suggestion of
malicious fortune has suppressed a! hope and expectation of delivery, wherein
as an unfeigned witness of their present dollour, they let fall certain tears
to accompany the pitiful dule of her, who upon the reaport of these last
accurrauntes, forgot not to fill the air full of hollow sighs, with open
exclamacion against the law of nature, that seamed so careless of her
creatures, as not only to leave them without armor or sufficent resistance,
against the ordinary assaults of the world, but also to make the^ subject by
special destenie, to the sentence and dome of a most unrighteous and hard
fortune, but albeit adversity (besides that she is subject to sundry sorts of
calamity) is also so quarellous of her one disposition that for the respect of
one simple or peculiar wrong, she makes us to exclaim generally against all
liberties and laws of God and man, yet ought we so to check that same humor
of inordinat rage, that mortifieth within us all regard of duty and reason,
that we despair not in the goodness of him, who being the giver of all comfort
and GOD of consolation, is more ready to dispose it on our behalf, then we
hable to deserve the gift of so great a benefit, and who in the mids of the
tears of this desolate Lady, being with the rest of her friends wholly
resolved to endure the rigorous sentence of their fate, presented the
CATASTROPHE of ye tragedy, with such an offer or mean of spedye delivery of
the prisoner, that it did not only excede thexpectation of all men but seamed
also the work of such a wonderful mystery, that no man was hable to imagine
the devise, before their eyes gave judgment of theffect* for the same day
about the nynth or tenth hour of the euenyng, ANSEAMNO SALYMBYNO whom
heretofore you have hard to be sore passioned with the love of ANGELYQVA
having spente certain days of recreacion in the country, is now returned to
SYENNA, where passing by the gate of his lady, he chanced to hear a
lamentable noise of women, bewailyng the misery of the montanynes, wherewith
pursewyng the brute with a more diligente ear, spyed at last coming out of
the pallayes of ANGELYQVA certain old dames his next neighbors, all to be
sprent and died with the dew of sorrowful tears, as though they hadd then
come from the funeral of some of their friends, of whom he enquired the cause
of such vnacustumable Dule, and whether and what new misfortune were happened
of late to ye house of ye Montauyns, and being at larg resolved of that which
you have hard by special report went imediatlye to his chamber, where he
began to discourse diuersely of this soddaine chance, sometime determining the
delivery of CHARLES for the only respect of his sister, whose good will he
thought he cold not purchase any way so well, as by the benefyt and price of
so great a frendshyppe, by and by he accounted the death of her brother a
most necessary mean to make him the master of his desire over his sister,
wherein after he had spente sometime in secret cogitacion, without any certain
resolution notwithstanding what to do, he seamed to Salymbyno debateth with
himself touching the deliuerye of his ennemie.

dowte of the thing I chiefly desyer, seeing fortune seames to take more care of
my contentement, then I am hable to wish or imagyn, undertaking (as it seames)
to present me with theffecte of my busynes whenne I least thought of any
hope or likelihod of good success, for by the death of the MONTANYN who is to
be executed to morrow in public as a rebel or heinous offender of the state,
I shall not only see the last revenge, of the most mortal enemies of our
house, but also live without fear, hereafter to be molested by any that shall
descend of him, and on the other side. his death takes away al impedime^tes,
offering either to stay or hinder me from enjoying of her whom I love so
dearly for her brother being dead and his goods and living confiscat to the
state, what stay or support has she, if not in her beauty, and love of some
honest gentleman who taking co^pasion of the loss of so Rare an ornament and
work of nature, may entertain her for his pleasure until the glass of so
brikle a gift dekay with his delight in her company, and then for the respect
of pytye, to bestow her in marriage with some compotent portion. But what
SALYMBYNO? shall the offer of any vnseamely reueng prevail above that respect
and duty thou art borne to bear and owe unto true virtue, or will thou so much
abuse ye former glory of thy ancestors and present renown of thy self with
an act no less detestable before GOD then hateful to the cares of all degrees
of honestye? and will thou thus deceive thexlpectation of thy friends, and
leave them in continual reproach to the posteritye of all ages, with a note of
such infamye that time her self can skarce race out of the remembrance of
man? if all thies lack authority to diswade the, let only the respect and awe
of virtue with remorce of conscience keep the from comitting so
hainousanoffence: for to wh at other end have the ancients put a diffrence
between the ge^tlemen and creatures of baser condition, but that in exposyng
fruits of cyuill courtesye, we should also strive to make our selves noble
and excede them in thimitacion of true virtue? and as it is far from the
office of a noble heart to thunder Reueng upon such as are not hable to resyst
thy power, so there can be no greater argument or proffe of true magnanimytie,
then in buryenge the desyer of vengeance in a tomb of eternal oblivion, to
expose most fruits of compassion, where there appears great cause to
extend the uttermost of rigor, and where on thaduerse party, is least
exspecte or hope of succoure, for how can a man lay a more sewer soundation
of perpetual glory, then in correctinge the humor of his foul appetite and
conquerynge the un bridled affections of the wilful mind, to make them bound
unto the by thy benefyts, who were in despair to receive any pleasure at thy
hands, yt which declaration of true virtue like as it happens so seldom
amongst men now a days, that we may ve raye well term it a thing exceeding
the common course and order of nature, So he that will challenge the title of
true nobility, and seame to excel the rest in thappeale of perfect honor,
must prefer in public such absolute effects of his worthynes and virtue, as
the same may iustlye appear meritorious of an immortal memory in the success
of al future ages. The chiefest points of so large co^mendacion which so many
records of antiquitye do attribute unto the great Dictatoure CAESAR, consiste
more in the clemencye he used to his ennemies being vanquished and under the
awe of his mercy, then in the mortal and many battles he fought against
the valiaunte. GALLS and britons, or subduing the renowned POMPEY: the grrat

deserved no less honor for the pytie and courtesy he used toward
SYSIGAMBIS the mother of DARIUS, with other desolate Ladies which he took
prisoners in the battle fought at Arobella, then fame in the conqueste of
the king and contreye of PERCIA and MEDIA, and at the death of the wife of
DARIUS in his camppe he let fall no less effucion of tears then if he had
been present at the burial of OLYMPIAS his natural mother, neyt her could
he have made so great a conqueste of the whole east world with his small
crewe and company of MACEDONIANS, if he had not subdued more contreys by
clemencye then force of arms: besides, who is ignorante of the late curtesye
of DON RODERICO VIVANO of Spain, who all be it might have revenged
thinfydelytye of DON PIETRO then king of Aragon for that he went a bowte to
ympeshe his expedicion against the sarazins being then at Granado did not only
for bear to punish him or put him to ransom, but also being his prisoner by
order and law of arms, dismissed him into his countreye with no less honor
then belonged to his estate, without any exaction of his person or realm,
wherein for my part, the more I reaue in the rariety of their noble virtues, so
much the more ought I, to increase my endeavor in thymitacion of the like
examples, and of the crontrary, what great cause have I to prefer a
continuation of the grudge ended alredye by war, or why should I stir up
eftefones a fresh Remembrance of the fault alredye forgeuen? what injury have
they don to me ormine, which was not returned unto them without intrest of
double revenge? admit their predecessors have been ennemies to my house, have
they not borne a more hard penance then the greatness of their offense
deserved? What cause have I then to renew the alaram of their misery, or why
stay I to succor their desolate state, in some satisfaction of the injuries
they have received by me and mine, besides the wrath of God according to the
words of the Apostle, is always hanginge over the heads of such, as seame
to take pleasure in the affliction of their neighbor, rejoice in the
misfortune or misery of an other, if all thies lack sufficient force to
mortify the remembrance of ancient malice within me, and in exposing
(contrary to the exspectatio^ and opinion of the world) a wonderful example of
virtue, to move me to releue his distress that dispaireth of all succor, and
reclaim by liberality the frendeshipe of him, who if he ever offended is
alredye pardoned, like as also if his innocence have been abused by me and
mine, my conscience calls me to a remorce, in rendering satisfaction in so
nedeful a time: yet am I drawn by a band of further duty, and incensed by a
somaunce or special instigacion of the honor and service, which my heart has
alredye vowed, on the behalf of her: whose beauty and virtue deserves a
greater meede, then the uttermost that I can do, either for the co^tentement of
her, or consolation of her brother, for like as there is no man (unless he be
utterly deuested from the gift of humanitye) being passioned with equal
affection and sosomoned by semblable desire to do some notable service to my
dear ANGELIQVA as I am, that would not rack his power to the highest pyn, to
take away the chief causes of her doleful tears, and restore her to a
spedie contentment convenient for her merit: So in louinge her I must also
embrace such as she accomptes and (by good right) are most dear unto her.
And if I will make a declaration of the true zeal I bear her, why do I stay
to expose it in so needful a time, and on the behalf of him, whom she
loves no less then her self, attending even now the fatal stroke of the
morderinge sword for a tryfflinge due of a thousand florentes: and why
should I doubt to make it known in public that only the force of love has
made me trybutary to the fair ANGELIQVA, for saying that kings and the
greateste monarkes of the World do draw under the yoke of his awe, it is not
for me to eschew that by special pryuiledge, which is incidente to all men
by nature, neither ought I herein to refuce the offer of my destenie, nor
straun gers to enter into much marvel, if I (being of the metal of other
men and subject to no less impression and passions of mind then the rest) do
make present dedication of my heart and service to her whose virtue I am sewer
is so in vincible against all adversity, that neither necessity, nor the
most extreme message that fortune can send her, is hable to make her forfeyte
the least point of her honesty, or forgette the renown of the genelogie
whereof she is descended: wherein as honest love has sturred up this mocion in
me with composicion to expose imediatlye the fruits and effect of semblable
virtue: So the spedye delyuerye of thy brother (Oh: ANGELYQVA) shall argue
sufficientlye to all men, that it is only the regard of thy beawtie that has
paid the price of his raunsom, and removed from his tender legs the heavy
yrons which the penance of hard imprisonemente had unjustly enjoined unto
him, tryumphinge also with this increase of further glory, that only the
regardes and glauncis of thy glisteringe eyes have made a breach into the heart
which earste has defied the malice and vttermoste of all force, and made him
bow of his own kind that never cold be brought to bend or stowpe to any
of what degree or condition so ever they were. And thou SEIGNEVR CHARLES for
thy part have this day gained so assured and perfect a friend, that if thou will confirm the league by frank consent, thamytie shall not be only
mutual between us till death discharge the same by separation of our bodies,
but also remeyne no less indissoluble to the posterytie and succession of
both our races for ever: And as in the first work of this new society, I
will not only strive to excede the in show of perfect frendeshippe, but also
make the way open by my example to all degrees of nobility to attain to the
like honor by semblable virtue So I pronounce hear a further confirmation on
my part, with protestation by the faith and life of a gentleman to embrace
the and thy friends with no less affection then my self and persecute thy
enemies with no less mortality then if they had conspired and put in use the
destruction of the noble house of SALYMBYNO: wherewith saying the necessity of
the time, craved rather an expedition of diligence, then longer discourse, or
deliberation, he took a bag of a thousand duckattes and we^^ymediatly to
ye Deputy receauor of the peynall forfeytures of the state of SYENNA whom he
found perusinge certain accomptes in his stodie. And after he had taken him
the bag, with addition that there was the whole demand due by DON CHARLES
MONTANYN, he commanded to give an acquitance with his writ of delyuery from
thinstante: but tellinge the contents of the bag he found a surplusage of
the some due by the prisoner, which as he offered to restore, so the other did
not only refuce to take it, but also would not depart the place, till he had
dispatched one of his people to the master of the Iayle, who perceiving a
tender of the money, wythdrewe the accion, and sent to fetch ye prisoner out of
his do^gion and dark cabynet, clogged with heavy shackels and clinkinge yrons
CHARLES hearing a noise of bownsinge at doares and opening of rustie locks,
imagined it had been the coming of some ghostly father to hear his shryft
and last confession, and that the senatte (in respect of the honor and
estimacion of his house had granted him the privilege of a secret execution
within the prison, for auoydinge the public shame which comonlye attendes the
miserye of such as declare their last testament upon the skaffolde in the
gaze of all the world: and having alredye examyned his conscience according
to the shortness of his leisure so farfurthe as he seamed only to attend the
fatal hour, desired god eftsoon to strengthen him with his grace, not
leauinge him without assistance in his iourneye and passage so perilous, where
oftentimes the most assured do not only waver but utterly declyne, if they be
not supported by his special favor in the end of which secret meditacion, he
commended unto his goodness the life of his dear sister, desiering with humble
tears in a special peticion and last request to be protector and defend her
always from all assaltes and offers of infamy or dishonor being thus brought
into the hal of the Iaylor, the tormentours or officers of the prison, began to
knock of the boltes from his legs, and present him besides (in show of
countenance) rather with arguments of consolation then cause of fresh disquiet
or distruste of delyuerie, which kind of curtesy not looked for stirred up in
his troubled mind a soddaine hope or expectation of good fortune, with an
absolute assurance almost of that which affore he durst never ymagine, and
much less account to come to pass, whereof notwithstanding the effect
appeared at thinstant, for the Iaylor showinge him his letters of delivery,
told him it was in his power to use the benefytte of his former lybertye, for
says he the law is choked and fullye answered of her due, and I safysfyed
to the vttermoste of the charges and fees of your imprisonmente, desyeringe
you (Sir) if you have found worse entreatie at my hands then I see your
offense has deserved to consider the charge of my office, and to impute it
rather to the strait commission enjoined me by the sen^tt, then any desyer of
my self to deal with you in other sort, then the bond and respect of the
dutiful zeal I bear you does require. Here is to be noted a wonderful
difference in the casualties accidental to man, and that the chaunges and
alterations in love be of a contrary disposition to the rest of the passions
that trouble the mind: neither need we doubt by the authority of this
example, no less credible then of great admiracion, but love is a certain
virtue of it self, saying it works theffect and exposes such fruits as
seame to resemble rather the operacto^of a divine miracle, then the suggestion
of our frail fancye, for how had this SALYMBYNO redeemed so frelye and in a
time of such need, the careful CHARLES (being firmly confirmed in mortal
grud^e as you have hard) if the very virtue which we are not hable to term
by all proper name in love had not broken by force of azealous affection, the
angry inclinacion of his nature, and converted the humor of his ancient wrath
into a compassion exceeding the imagination of man. And as it is an ordenarye
argument of humanytie to give succors to such as neither have deserved any
thing of us and much less we never knew nor saw, because nature herself
does somon us all to be thankful to such as resemble our selves in condition
or calling: So that virtue deserves treble comendation, which exceeding (as
it were thauthoritie of nature) does force in us such an inclynacion which
does not only mortefye in our hearts the obstinat humor norished of long
continuance, but makes us pliable to the things which we cold not so much as
admit before into our cogitacions and much less perform by any perswacion
of the world: where of you may note a familiar experience in the disposition
of this SALYMBYN who suffered himself to be more overcome with the beauty,
virtue and seamelye behauior of ANGELIQVA, then with any humility or
importunatte suit of her brother although he had layen prostrate a
thousand times before his knee. And what heart is tempered with the metal of
such induracion that is not mollified, and made tractable by the regardes of so
rare a mystery, as the exquisite beautye of this SYENNOYSE, or who will not
slack the Rain of his lofty stomach and stoop to the somance of such a
paragon, humblynge himself withal every way to get the good will of her that
gave place to no creature in the world for all perfections of God and nature,
neither is there any reason at all to charge him with imputacio^ of folly that
indeuoureth to honor and embrace in his heart, the beautye and other gifts of
so virtuous a Lady, nor his travail meritorious of other name, then the title
of honest exercise, who addinge an exact diligence to his dutiful zeal and
service in the pursuit of her whose virtues procure his affection, has his
heart armed only with an upright meaning of sincere integritye, and the
desire of his mind tendyng to none other end then a consommation of an honest
and lawful request: But for the contrary of this honest society, I account
him not worthy to have the air breath upon him, who practisinge only to
seduce and corrupt the chasteye of honest Dames, has no respect to the virtue
of honest and true love, but sekyng only to satisfy the appetit of his sensual
lust, does embrace the exterior parts of a woman, and commendes simplye the
tree charged with leaves, without regardyng the frut which makes it worthy of
commendacion and fame. Here with it can not be much from our purpose to
enterlarde this digression, with the authority of a brief note, which I
found written in a french book on the behalf of the sinceritye which ought
to appear in women, comparinge the young Lady bearing yet the name of a
maid to the glisterynge flower in the pleasant spring, until by her
constancy and chaste behauior, subduing utterly the wanton mocions of the
flesh, she expose to the world the precious fruits derived of so great a
virtue and give absolute experience other undoubted pudicitie: For otherwise
(says he) she is in no other degree for worthy renown, then the young
soldiour whose contenaunce albeit argues the courage of his heart, yet his
captain has no reason to give judgment of his valiauntnes, nor cause to
reapose much credit in him in any expedition or exploite against thenemye,
till he see an approved effect in deed of that which he promises so largely by
his outward appearance, but when he fyndeth an absolute confirmation of the
exterior likelihodes by the inward virtue and valyauntnes of the mind, it is
then that he does not only embrase him, but prefers him before the rest as a
special pattorne to ymitate his virtues Even so besides that the Croune of
immortal glory, atten des you Ladies, who by withstanding thassaultes and
importunities of the flesh, do give to your self the true title of honest
women, not by force or awe of constraint, but by the valiant resistance of
your most chaste and invincible heart, yet also the monument of your virtues
being graued in pillors of eternity, and advanced to the height of the
highist theatrey in the world, shall remain as a mirroer or worthy spectacle
to procure all posterities not only to tread the pathe of semblable virtues,
but also to yield you a continual adoracion after your death by the
remembrance and view of your chaste and verteous life, wherewith wishyng you
al no less desire to live well, then the most of you are gredy of glory. I
leave you to the remorce of your own consciences and presents you here with
the remeinder of my promise touching the sequel of CHARLES MONTANYN, who
being out of prison as you have hard repaired immediately to his house, with
intent to comfort her, whom he knew to be in greater dollour and distress,
and as nedeful of consolacion, as himself seamed desirous of repose, being so
long forewatched in a filthy prison, and knocking at the gates of his Pallais,
the maid that opened the door and saw it was her master, mounted with more
speed then an ordinary pase and told ANGELIQVA the deliuerye and approach of
her brother, whereunto (what addicion or protestation her maid seamed to make)
her troubled mind would give no credit: such great impossibility do we
account in the execution of those things which we chiefly desire: but
seaminge no less amazed with the mystery, the^ saint Peter being soddainly
taken forth of the prison of HEROD by the Aungel, sloode as though she had
been dreaming of the dissolution of the world without appearance of sense or
argument of lively morio^ in any part of her til ye presence of her brother
(being now in her chamber) seamed to breath in her an air of fresh co^solatio^
and life, and dismissing from thinsta^t ye mystery of her domme trau^ce,
received oftsones her former use and liberty of senses, wherewith co^uerting
her dolorous regards and tears of ancient dule into a passion of such sudden
gladness, that being at ye point to co^gratulat his co^mig with words, she felt
a second impediment of spech by ye operation of preset joy which she took in
beholding his face, yt she fell down at his fete, embrassig and kissyng his
knees with no less signs and show of a gladsome mind, then if by some
miracle he had been raised from death to life, wherewith certain Ladies her
kynswomen, assistinge her dolorous distress, having restored her last
trance, and doubtyng eftsoon to fall into the like passion, sent for their
husbands with other the friends of MONTANYNO, as well to rejoice his happy
delivery and so to avoid al occasions of further traunces in his sister, as
also to excuse their negligence in not assisting his late misery: but CHARLES
dissimuling yt which he thought of their discourtesie toward himself, gave
the^ chief thanks for their friendship in co^forting his sister, which he
co^strued to as great an honor and argument of good will, as if they had
employed it on ye behalf of himself, wherewith he dismissed them, deuining
notwithstanding what he should be that had made so large declaration of so great
a virtue, and sorrowful without measure that he knew him not, to the end he might
not only requi^e so rare a courtesy, but also excede him in liberality by a
frank offer of himself and all that he has within the world: he scamed not so
ignorant of thauthor of so great a benefit, as his sister in treble doubt on
ye same behalf, persuading herself notwithstanding that the fear of death had
made him co^ueigh a secret sale of his lands in the country to him which first
broked it. And that this doubt which seamed to trouble him was only a dark
veil to conceile the trothe and keep it from her knowledge, or rather his
long imprisonment with disquiet of mind duringe his trouble, had stalled his
senses and made him rave in yt sort, wherein she was in equal doubt of them
al, til he resolved her to the contrary, wherewith departing for that night,
they repaired to their several cha^bers, where ye MONTANYN had more desire of
sleep, then hable to admit any rest, for that he spent all that night in
contemplatio^ and contrariety of thoughts, making an assembly in his mind
of every shape and figure of such his friends as he was hable to imagine to be ye
workers or cause of so great a benefit, sometime preferring one, sometime
prese^ting an other, without touching notwithstanding ye perfect whit, or
naming him that justly had deserved the meede of so great a merit, and to
whom he acknowledged no less bond of duty then Parent^s.
to them that were the first causers of his coming into this world, wherein
passing that night the pictures of a thousand men, his bed seamed to serve him
as a wide and large plain, or some rowmey alley or close arbor within a thick
wood to roll up and down, making his discourse with sundry sorts of diverse
ymaginations, until the discovering of the red globe orforronner of the day
somoned APOLLO to harness his horse and begin his course over our HEMISPHERE,
when he rise and went to the officer of the fyske, of whom he demanded to
know what he was that discharged the debte of his late forfeyture. He whom you
can skarcely ymagin (says ye receauour) has exceded all your friends infirm
and faithful zeal toward you, to whom I have delivered the releace of your
imprisonment, but not ye acquitau^ce of ye money, because here is an overplus
which I have here to tender unto you, with your general discharge, wherwt Charles
no less moved against him for ye offer of ye money, then grieved with the curious
delay he seamed to use in disclosing ye name of so great a fre^d, requested him
eftesones to cut of his suspense, and make him know ye man to whom he was so
much bound. The rare ver tue and courtesy of ANSEAMO SALIMBINO (says he) has
preferred cause of perpetual shame to al your friends and allies, and opened
you the way not only to be equal, but excede him in semblable merit,
wherewith he departed with an infynity of conceiptes and constructions of the
courtesy of his enemy, and being at his house in a secret gallerye void
from all company or occasion of disturbance, began to discourse diversely of
thaccident, but chiefly what should stir up such generositie with
inexspectable humanity in him, who with his parents and all the power he
might make, had been the only and mortal scourges of his whole house, at
last startyng up (as it were out of a dead sleep or newly delivered from the
misterye of some sudden qualme) began to remember some glees of frendshy, which
he had heretofore noted in SALIMBINO on the behalf of his sister, which
appeared chiefly in the often palewalkes and purmenades he made by the gate of
his Pallais, where if by chance his eyes encou^tred with the view of
ANGELIQVA, he forgot not to prefer a reverence and salutacion rather of an
affectioned heart, then a mind charged with grudge or any kind of enymitie,
wheruppon he resolved immediately that the only beautye of his sister did
plead for his life, and purchase his deliuerye, concludyng withal in his
mind, The noble heart soonest inclined to love.
that as ye noble heart is soonest inclined to love, so when true affection has
once made a breach into the intralles of the valyant and princely mind, it is
impossible but she should expose marvelous effects and fruits of honest
virtue, like as also the ymp derived of noble kind, and descended of the
progeny of renowned predecessors, can not so mask or cover his norriture and
education, but the virtue of the mind will advance herself in the countenance
with show of nobility in the face, and prefer a facility in that, which
the voice of the world has not only judged impossible, but also absolutely
persuaded that he would never be brought to do it, either of free consent or
force of any awe or allurementes, wherein for his part because he would neither
be surmounted in honesty nor noted of any spot of ingratitude determined to
revenge the good turn he had received with such prodigal recompense, that
he would seame no less liberal in retorninge thintereste of the benefit
received, then the other treble meritorious for thexample of so rare a virtue,
wherefore having nothing worthy to present the frendshipp of SALIMBINO, but
himself and his sister, determined to impart his present resolution with the
fair ANGELIQVA, and after dispose themselves by mutual assent to make a
tender and frank offer of that which was in them, to be employed on the
behalf of him and his as he list to ymagine the occasion, wherein because he
was now in the country without intent to return to the city till the
expiracion of some iiij. or v days, CHARLES, fynding his conscience heauelye
charged with a debte on his behalf, thought to practice for him in his
absence, as well as he was myndefull of his late misfortune, and thereupon
procured his sister into a gardein far from any haunte or company to troble
them, where he brake with her in this sort,

Amongst all the chaunges and conuersions of mortal affairs Montanyno seeks
to re quit the good torn of his enemy.
(my dear sister) there is none a more familiar precedent of the malice of
fortune, then he that is touched with diversity of evils, nor any so great a
pattern or example of her mobitie, as they that find often change of estate,
and yet for all that, we ought not to suffer any aduersatie to deminishe the
virtue and constancy of the mind, neither is it our part to give so grievous a
sentence of the state of ma^s mortality, as either to deny mercy to such as
be in misery or despair of compassion whenne our selves be touched with
affliction, seeing that as things mortal are full of change, Fortune not to
be holden against her vvil, and god is bound to no time.
and no man has perpetual felicity, So there is no man certain of any
thing that he has, and God is bound to no time, and fortune being slipperie
of her self, and not hable to be holden against her will, does never give so
great felicity, but she enioyneth a double penance with trouble of treble
annoy in respect of the benefyt. And besides he that falls from the uttermost
spray, or height of the highest tree, finds less case and more danger, then
such as feel them selves taken from the low and shallow branches supported
upon the firm earth. Al which I prefer unto you in this place as well by a
peculyar instigacion and remorce of mind restoring a new remembrance of the
noble condition of our Ancestors, the ancient glory of our race, and former
renown of the house of MONTANYNO, as also to stir up in us both a fresh
supply of sorrowful tears on the behalf of the late depopulation and utter
ruin of the same: wherein for my parts, as often as I behold the rich seats
and stately buildinges, sometime the resident and ordinary places of abode of
our fathers and grandfathers: when my desolate eyes glaunsinge upon diverse
corners of this city, do feed upon the view of sondrye skutchions and pendels
of our arms bearinge a special mark or badge of thantiquitie of our famuly,
or that in the cathedral churches or chief temples of this city I peruse the
inscription of so many statelye tombs and perpetual monumentes of marble,
shrowdyng the bodies of so many noble Knights and notable Captains descended
of the line of MONTANYNO: but chieflye as often as I put my foot within the
entrey of this pallais (the very rest and last remeinder of them whose
authority only has erst governed the state of this commonwelth), I feel my
self so passioned with inward grefe, and my heart within distillinge drops of
blodd on the behalf of so great a desaster, that I wish more often then I am
hard to be taken away from the dolourous regard of such wretched
desolation, to the end that I alon might not live as the od relike or uttermost
rest of our subverted house. And albeit we may challenge the first place in the
beadrol of unhappy wretches, saying our fortune has exchaunged our ancient
felicity, for a present life of extreme miserye, yet if there be any cause of
consolation in adversity, we have raison to joy in the condition of our
state, chefly for that we are not justly to be charged with imputacion of evil
or dishonest trade any way, and that notwithstanding the raging malice of our
fortune with the force of poverty pinchynge extremely, the discourse of our
lives has so confirmed the generositie of our ancestors, that we keep the
consent of al voices, to be nothing inferior to the best of them in any respect
of virtue or show of true nobility: For I have alwaie endeavored to observe
this one rule and discipline of the re nowmed Emperor and captain MARCUS
ANTHONIVS, who persuadeth that as the heyght of estate ought not to alter
Height of estate ought not to alter the goodness of nature.
the goodness of nature: So the froward disposition of fortune ought not to
take away or diminishe the constancy of the mind, with this addicion that he
bears her malice best that hydes his myserye most: Besides thusmuche dare I
aduouche of my self, that as I was never presented with the offer of any good
turn, which I have not thankefullie requited to thuttermoste: So I have not
been a nigarde of any thing I have on the needful behalf of my friend or
other companion, detestynge always that any jot of ingratitude should stain
the reputation wherein I have lived hytherunto: For as amongst a number of
vices in men now a days, the note of vnthanfulnes is no less detestable then
any of the rest: So for my part I wish the rigor of THATHENYANS law upon
him, who seames The Athenians punished unthankfulness by death.
either forgetful of the benefyt passed, or unthankful to the friendship of
him that brought succors to his necessity when he dispaired of relief: wherein
(my dear sister) albeit you may happelye imagine the cause of this long
circunstaunce, yet can you give no certain judgment of the end or
conclusion, nor divine ryghtely the meaning of the misterye which I purpose
to reveal unto you. The threatnynge peril which earste houered to cut in
sonder the fyllet of my life, is of so late a time, that I am sewer your mind
has not yet dismissed the remembrance of so fearful a tragedye, neither
have you forgotten I know how as it were by special miracle, I was boughte
out of the hands of the executioner of justice and redeemed from the rigorus
sentence of the partial senatt, without thassistance of any my parents or
alyes, by either simple offer of word or effect: wherein as I am warned by this
experience not only to putt small confidence in any of my kynsmen hereafter,
but also to reappose no assurance at all in their flatteringe show of fained
face, so I have tasted of so great a pleasure at the hands of him who never
deserved well of me, nor I cause to ymagyne any one drop of humanitye in him
on my behalf, that if I do right to his virtue, I have reason to admit him
not only among the fellowship, but also the first and chief of my dear
friends: for being pressed so much with the iniquitte of the time, with
fresh assaltes of new afflictions, and forsaken with all of my nearest
friends, I had reason to ymagyne, and cause to fear that thonly malice of our
mortal enemies (for the extirpation of the whole stock and root of our
race) had been the workers of my last trouble and danger of death: But (good
sister) in this distruste I have abused the virtue of our late adversary
deseruynge to endure penance for entringe into conceits of conspiracye
against him, whose late benefyte (exceeding the ymaginacion of all men) has
made me bound to honor the remembrance of his name with a debte of duty so
long as nature shall phan in me the breathe of life: for in place where I
feared most danger, I found most sauetie, and where I exspected least
sewertye, I encowntred most assurance, And that hand which I attended only
to give the fatal blow of my destruction, has not only removed all occasions
or offers of present peril, but become the chiefest pillor and proppe of mine
honor and life hereafter, wherein because you shall be partaker of the playnnesse
of my tale, as well as you have used patience in the hearing of the
circumstance, yt is ANSEAMO SALYMBYNO the son and heir of our aunciente
persecutours, who has made so manyfeste a declaration of his affected zeal
toward our house, that in taking your brother owte of the hands of
thunrighteous senate and present danger of perentorye destruction, he has
seamed so lauishe of his liberal mind, that in place of vii. C florentes, he
has paid a thousand Duckattes for the ransom of him, who judged him the
most crewell enemy of the world: what argument of noble heart is this or
how seldom does a man encounter such rare fruits of virtue? friends knitt
together by a special league of amytie or mutual vow of frendeshippe, do
oftentimes make the world wonder of the sundry fruits and effects of
constancy which appears between theime: but where the mortal enemy, being
neither reconciled nor required nor demaundinge any assurance for the pleasure
he does, paieth not only the debte of his aduersarye, but restores his state
when he is at point to perform the last of his fatal somaunce I think it
excedes all the consideration of such as use to discourse upon the doings of
men. I know not what title to give to the act of SALYMBYNO, nor how to
term this his curtesye, if not that his doings deserve a better meede then
the renown of DAYMON and PITHIAS or other most loyal friends whom the
writters do favor with such surnames of glory: but as I am a chief witness
of his virtue, so the example of his present honesty has sturred up such
an affected humor within me that either I will dye in thindeuor, or else I wylbe
equal if not hable to excede him in the return of his liberality, wherein
being iustelye bownde to engage the best part in me, for the recompense of
that good torn which gave increase to my life, I am to crave a special
assistance of you (Sister) for the complotte of the devise which I have
already ymagyned and fullye resolved to perform to thend I may be only
bownde to you for thacquitaunce of the liberalytye of SALIMBINO, by whose helxe
you that earste Lamented the loss of liberty and life of your brother may
now congratulate his health and happy delyuerye: where with the fair
ANGELIQVA fully resolved by this last report of her brother, that it was
SALEMBINO which had surmounted all her parents and friends in the delyuerye
of her only confort, and consolacion of their whole house, made a frank
promise of her aid in this sort: like as (says she) I was never hable to
ymagyne yt your delyuery was wrought by so Rare a mean, nor yt our enemies The
answer of Augelyqua to her brother.
(dissoluinge the remembrance of aunciente quarrel) would retire to a care
and conseruacion of the health and life of the MONTANYNS: even so I think
your debt is the greater by the awthoritie of him that has done the
benefyte, and more worthy of am ple consideracion, then if the good torn
had been don by any of your parents and allies: for thymitacion of a virtue
ought to excede the example of the awthor, chieflye where thoccasion is deryued
of such an vnlikelihod, that the compass of brain seames insufficiente to
ymagine so verteous an act, wherein for my part, if I were as hable as I am
willinge, his curtesye, should be returned at so large an intreste, that
himself should think his benefyt nothing in respect of the recompense, and
the world to witness the generositie of the MONTANYNS, but having no way
thassistaunce of fortune to present him with any thing that may balance with
the merit of his curtesye, and being besides a maid without access to his
house, by reason of the small hawnte I use with the ladies his kinswomenne, I
can do no more but yield honor to his virtue with secret thanks in my
heart, with acknowledginge the debte until we be hable to discharge it with
equal recompense: albeit (brother) if you have devised the mean wherein you
account me necessary to be ymploied, doubt not of me in any respect, so
that mine honor only be not distressed. Amongeste ann infinitte discourses
appearing seuerallye in my vnquiette mind (says he) I can not rest
upon any likelye cause or mean to work theffecte of so Rare a curtesye in
this gentlemanne on my behalf, nor to procure him in so soddayne a momente to
break the bond of annciente grudge, and to convert his natural hate into a
frendeshippe without a second or comparison, if it be not the fire of a
covert love kindled of long time within the tender parts of his intrails, and
suppressed with a wonderful grief to himself, til now, that encountringe so
conueniente an occasion to set abroache the vessel of his burninge desire,
with mean to euente the flame that will no longer smother, but bulk out into
open show, he makes open declaracion of that which he can no longer conceile:
ah wonder full force and virtue in love, who has power to convert the mind
oppressed with passion of collor into a disposition tractable beyo nd all
exspectacion, and in one momente to change that wherein all me^ judged an
ympossibylitie of conuercion, it is only thy beauty ANGELYQYA with respect of
other thy perfections which Love has power to work a facility in that
which all men think ympossible.
have transformed our late enemy into the parson of a perfect friend, it is
the general ^ame of thy honest and verteous life yt has sommoned SALYMBYNO to
deliver thy miserable brother abandoned of all his friends and in despair of
any good fortune, Oh, noble gentleman and heart of a king lackinge no kind of
magnanymitie, what means alas have 3 to approach that honest liberality
whereunto thou haste bownde me by so sewer obligacion? I live to serve the and
am ready to dye to do the pleasure? mine honor is reserved to be ymploied by
the, and my goods and lyuinge attend thy sommonce to dispose of them at thy
pleasure, thou haste also made such a stealthe of my heart that only death is
hable to redeem it, what is there then remaininge, but that you ANGELIQVA,
remove incontinent the veil of al supersticion, and vnseamely cruelty in
disposinge thy self to be thankful to him who has won thy goodwill by the
wager and warranty of verteous love, and who as a first earneste penny of his
service and duty toward the, did present a thousand ducekettes for the
ransom of mine honor and life, which if they remeyne of equal care unto
the now, as thabundance of thy late tears with dollorus regardes did earste
argue to all the world, whereof also thou gaueste a chief declaration in thy
free consent to se^ mine inheritance for the redemption of my thraldom: Stick
not to dispose thy self now so frankely on my behalf, that I may revenge the
favor which SALYMBYNO has don me (for the respect of thy love) with a present
no less precious and rare, then his act is justly meritorious of perpetual
fame in all ages: And as he refuced not turn up the bottom of his coffers to
ransom my liberty: So lackinge the consent of equal fortune to return his
curtesye with semblable payment, let us make a present of your beauty, which
I am sewer he will not abuse any way, consydering that he wantes no furniture
of virtue which is necessary for the adorninge of a noble heart, which as it
is all the mean I have to make a counterchange of his benefytt, and bring me
out of debt with him whose money lyethe in pawn for the liberty of my life:
So I beseech you (good sister) consider the justice of my request and prono
wnce a resolucion in such sort, as requitinge that which is due to him, I
may yield you alone al homage and hold my life only of you: but if your
answer putt me either in doubt or despair of this mean to make even with
so true a creditor, assure your self I will rather abandon both city and
country and disclaim the company of al my friends, then live amongst you with
the name of an unthankful parson, or be pointed at of the world not to
requite so great a good torn as the delivery and sauinge of my life,
wherefore saying that in you alone consistes the whole reappose of your
desolate brother, determine either his abode and company with you for ever, or
else his departure within these three days, to wast the remeinder of his
wretched life in continual wander in foreign soiles, with absolute intent
never to set foot within any part of ITALY hereafter. Wherewith the pore
ANGELIQVA became no less astonished and voyede of sense then if she had been of
a soddayn assailed with an APOPLEXY al be it the passion of her mind
quarrellinge so long with in that her stomach seamed to pant as it were the
breathe of it, little bellows upon a fordge, brake out at last by a watery
vent at her eyes distillinge whole rivers of tears, and restored her to the
use of her speech, which she uttered to her brother in this sort. I have often
read (says she) that it is easy for an innocente to find words to speak,
and very hard for a man in myserie to keep a temperaunce in his tale, but I
doubt I shall find by a present experience of my self, that the defense of a
prisoner is not only superfluous but also hateful seaminge rather to reprove
then inform the judge, wherein I am the rather persuaded (my dear brother)
for that the terms of thy last request dependinge upon yssues of
extremeties, do argue both a justice to perform thy desyer and an incyuilitie
in the in making so unreasonable a demand, the one chalenginge a consent in
me by thympression of nature and bond of dutiful zeal on my behalf toward
the, the other charginge the with iniquity for the respect of that which
thou would have me to do: But saying every request craves a return of
answer, and the greater qualytie or condition the cause is of, the greater
delyberacion ought we to use, ^^iefelye where it ymportes either thabsolute
breach or firm confirmation of the league of lyneall consanguynitye: I
beseech you grant no less patience to the words of my reply, then I have
been contented to favor your vehement protestacion with a dollorous scilence,
neither let me any longer inveighe in mine answer, then I shall seame to
prefer good reason to iustefye my just complaint, the cause whereof does
march with more alarams of annoye through all the parts in me, then if I were
presently pinched with the most grievous torments of the world: seeing that my
life, with therposition of the same is nothing in respect of that which thy
ymportunities do labor to set abroche and put in vent for the only
satisfaction of a prodigal liberalitye: for if the price of my life would
suffice for the raunsom of mine honor, and appaisement of thy appetit, thou
could no sooner ymagyn thy contentement, then the same should be exposed on
thy behalf, neither would I take half the time to perform it which I have
used in making yt the promise I thought alas the late delyuery of my brother,
had brought to us all an undoubted dispense of further trouble, and that he had
buried in the pit of his ymprysonmente all occasions of further disquiette:
And who would have judged, but in the last assalte and unjust offer of
undeserved death, fortune had spitt the vttermoste of her poysened malice, and
that in deuestinge herself from the theatrye or throane of rigorous cruelty,
she had also broken in pieces the bloddye arrows wherewith of so long time
she has persecuted our desolate house and pronounced trewyce at last to the
wearye miferies of the wretched state of the MONTANINS But alas unhappy
creature that I am I find now our destenie is rather deferred, then our
miserye at an end, seeing yt that unjust gods of unworthy revenge and most
cruel stepmother inuadinge me with more fury then affore does threaten my
young and tender years with more perentorye plages, then ever she thondred
upon any of my former race: for if ever she pursewed our fathers
graundefathers or any predecessors with mortal affliction, or intent of
utter ruin, it is now she has chosen her time to put to her last hand to
the extreme extirpacion of the miserable relics and remeyndor of our pore
house, either by the wilful loss and perpetual exile of ye my dear brother
or untimely death of thy dysolate ANGELIQVA, who can not make prostitucion of
her chastetye without the sacrafyce and oblation of her miserable life: what is
destenye if this be not the consent and judgment of the heavens, with resolution
to subpla^t ye stock and gra^tes of our house, seeing yt I a simple girl without
force void of assistance of age or experience, is constrained to admytt th one
of two evils, whereof the choice ought and is hable to amase the most wise
and experienced creature that this day enjoys the benefytt of mortal life,
alas my heart fails me, and reason (forsaken and flede from me) has left my
mind ballauncinge in such confucion and contraryetie of thoughts, that
being brought to thertremetye of two distresses of equal peril and
indifferente terror, I doubt whether to commit my life to short and sharppe
penance or prolonge my days in pyninge dollor, and secret care of mind: for
the sentence which thou haste pronounced of both our estates, is either to make
a separation by extreme exile of my brother, who is no less dear in my heart
then the ten dressed part of mine eye, and in whom next after GOD I have reposed
the whole assurance of my hope and consolacion of life, or else in conseruinge
him, I see my self at point to be constrained to make merchandise (I can not
tell in what sort nor for what price) of that precious treasure, which once
lost, is not to be reclaimed by any means, and for the guard whereof al women
of vprighte mind honoring virtue or desierous of reputacion, ought rather to
expose theimselues to a thousand mortal perilles and hazardes of death, if
nature and life were hable to abide so many encownters, then to suffer one
spotte of infamy to stain or corrupt this precious ornament and gift of
chastity, which as it is the only support and decoration of ye life of an
honest woman, so for a contrary, she that loses the possession of so rich a
Jewel, or deuesteth her self of the title and crown of so great a glory,
although she seame to live and keep place among other creatures, yet is she
dead in effect and her life recorded in the book of black defame as a witness
against herself in the latter days, and in the mean time a continual reproach
and objection of shame to such as she leaves to succeed her in kindred or name
How can that Lady or gentlewoman march amongeste the crewe of virtuous dames,
whose honor is either in doubt or reputacion in dekaye by the loss of her
honor, but that the blod of shamo appearyng in all parts of her face, will not
only discover her fault, but makes her wearye of her life by the remorce or
remembrance of so foul a forfaiture. How could the daughters of the Emprour
AUGUSTUS seame justly meritorious of the title of true nobility, or worthily
deserve to be called the children of such a father, after their sundry
villains and lascivious trade of living, hadd dispoyled them of the gifts and
ornaments of virtue presentyng them (to the eyes of all the world) as
creatures not worthy to have the common air to breath upon them. what honor
hadd FAVSTINA in wearyng the Imperial crown upon her head, seeing she had lost
the crown and garlande of chastetie, by her disordred and dishonest life?
Sewer she ought not to enjoy the breath of life, nor participati with the
presence or benefitt of the earth, that makes less stoare of her honesty,
then of the deareste part belonging to her soul or body: neither is she
worthy to be admitted amongst the felowshipp of virtues Dames, that departs
with so precious an ornament at other price^ then the exchange or loasse of her
life, notwithstanding the writers of former time have done manifest wrong to
diverse simple women, whose virtue in preseruinge their honest name with true
title of pudicitie, deserves rather an everlasting remembrance, with notes of
vuiuersall praise in pillars of eternity, then to be buried without pomp in
the tomb of dark oblivion. Ah dear brother what is become of thy ancient
generosity and virtue of mind, which heretofore thou have exposed on the
behalf of the honest and chaste Ladies of thy kindred and race, haste thou
converted that care and curious zeal, which hythervnto all men have noted in
the on my behalf, into a present intent to take away my lif, and renown
after my death? because thy peruersed fortune has deprived the of the most
part of thy possessions and liuinges, will thou therefore that I make like sale
of min honor, which I have kept hethervnto with so great watch and
diligence? will thou (my dear brother that ANSEAMO do triumph with more
glory in the victory of my virginity, then if he had constrained the rest and
remeinder of our miserable race to pass by the edge of his mordrynge sword?
Remember alas that the hurtes and diseases of the soul be far more vehement
and of a contrary disposition to them which afflict and annoy the body, And is
it I unhappy and thryswretched girl that must do penance for thoffences of
us all? is this the justice of the gods, or rigorous dome of my angry
destinies: if ye heavens have resolved my ruin, why do they not rather co^mitt
me to fatal execution, the^ present me upon the Alter of fylthie ymolacions or
offerings to the devouring goddess of filthy lust, Venus.
and that to appease the appetit of a young man, who peradventure desiereth no
other pray then ye spoils of my honor? How pappie was the noble VIRGINIA of
Rome, who was slain by the hands of her own father, to avoid violacio^ of
her body by ye lascivious Emprour APPIVS the common enemy to the honor and
reputacion of al honest Ladies? alas why staith my brother to purchasse like
renown by performing semblable execution upon me, rather then of his own
mind, to become the infamous minister of my life ready to abide the danger of
dishoneste force, if God become not the protector of his servant, and take my
cause into his hand? why does death defer to do his duty, or stay to dip
the end of his venomous dart in the congeiled blod of my dieng sprit, and
dispatch me with speed to visit the shadows of my happy predecessors, who
understanding my present distress, can not be void (I am sewer) of passion on
ye behalf of my wretched extremety? why did not God and nature give power to
the midwyf to smother me at thinstant that her cursed hands, received me from
the womb of my mother, rather then in preseruyng my life with the milk of
tender norriture, to make my youth subject to sundry sorts of affliction, and
now in the age and exspectation of quiet to present me the choice of ij. of the
most mortal evils in the world? what council have I to assiste me in so
doubtefull a case: or which way can I turn me, where I am not indifferently
assailed with remorse on the behalf of my brothers request, and shame with
desperacion in the simple remembrance of the fact? Alas shall I loase him whom
nature and law of kind, have named the one half of my self, and to commit
theffect of his demand, is no less dampnable before God, then if I did
violence and force against my self with mine own hands, neither have I
remedy or reason to eschew either of these evils, but by thassistance of the
oh cruel Attropos whom I beseech with the last tears of this complaint to whet
thy fatal knif, and shred in sonder with speed ye twyst of my wretched days,
least in preuentinge thy slacknes or slender haste, these hands of mine
undertake to supply thine office with unnatural revenge of my present sorrow,
wherewith her tears and sighs ceased upon a sudden, and her tongue
foltering in her mouth, her complexion of face was also converted into a pale
and ghastlye regard, in such sort as the passion of this trance, stopping
Angeliqua falls into a sound.
the conduites and course of her breath, she seamed to have as little feeling or
show of life as the seat whereon she sat, which when CHARLES beheld, with
resolution that the mystery contained neither vision nor dream, nor charm of
deceit, but that his sister had been as utterly without hope of recovery, as
she seamed senceles and without breath: overcome with dolor and despair to live
after her whom he only had preferred to so wretched a death, fell upon a
sudden from the place where he sat upon the ground, without moving either hand
or foot: the noise of whose fall restored ANGELIQVA, to some little rebalation
and use of breath, recouerynge in like sort the opening of her eyes, with a
general mocion and feelyng in all her parts, and being thus at liberty of free
consideracion, her eyes disclosed immediately the piteous estat of her brother,
whom she judged now to have delivered her of further care to perform his
request, wherein seeing a general retire of all his senses, and only view
of his dead body remeynynge to increase her doloure, she stood at the point
to use the same revenge of her self, that THIS BE did when she found her
friend dead: but finding his body warm, with some argument of recouerye, she
forgot not the use of any medecin, wherein she judged virtue to reclaim life,
and falling with all flat upon the body of her dead brother, she began to
curse her fortune, and accuse the stars of crucltie, inueighing withal
against the sle^der friendship of her self toward him who made no conscience
to offer to dye to preserve his patriimonie and inheritance only for her
sustentation, in the end by thapplicatio^ of certain medecines and
odoriferous smells, sometime sprinkling cold water upon his face, dropping
viniger into his mouth, and sometime rubbing his temples and pulses, with other
sleightes to revoke him that is but half dead, she brake the bed of his
trance, openyng a vent to utter the course of his breath, wherewith also his
eyes disclosed, and challenged their wonted light, beholdinge with doleful
regardes, his desolate sister, who saying all his parts replenished eftsoon
with vital mocions, that he was in case to understand and give judgment of her
words, said unto him: saying my mishap is so great, that she will admit no
dispense of her malice, and thou dear brother so wholly resolved in thy
wilful imagination, that I must yield to thy somance and become the minister of
the sentence of thy heart, more prodigal and bountiful then is convenient by
the consent of raison, I am content to become thankful according to thy
desyer, and more ready to perform thy request, then thou haste raison to
eracte so much upon me, wherefore do away thy desperate regardes, and looks
not vnliket o him that is plunged in a passion of tremblyng fear, receyuynge
with gladness the present offer of thy careful sister, who here presents
herself the handemaide of thy will, gyuynge the full Angeliqua consents to
her brothers request.
commission to dispose of this pore carcass at thy pleasure, and make a
present of it to such as thou accomptes thy self so greatly indebted unto:
only I am to warn the of one thing, wherein thou can not note me of any
mislike by justice, because ye integrity and virtue of my intent defends me
from imputacion yt way, and which asso I give the absolute assurance to
perform, that is, being once discharged of thy authority, thou shall use no
more power to restrain me from doing the thing which my mind has alredye
decreed, protesting unto the by the right hand of him that governs the
universal globe, that as no man shall touch ANGELIQVA, but in sort and order of
marriage, so if I be committed to a further force thou and all the world shall
perceive that I have a heart will enharden thies hands to make a sacrifice of my
life to the chastetie of those noble Ladies, which heretofore have rather
desired to dye, then live with a note of infamy or dishonor: for as my soul
shall never stand in hazard of grace, by the villainy of any act which my
body shall commit by free consent, even so if this carcass be forced to
violacion, I doubt not but the integrity of my mind will purchasse a
priuiledg against all purgatory of my soul, witnessing in the other world
mine innocence and invincible heart: wherewith she renewed the alaram of her
sorrow, with a fresh supply of sudden tears, with such abundaunce and
impetuositie of dule, that a man would have thought, that the whole humor
and moist parts of her brain had been drained and dried up by the surges of
continual tears which ceased not to fall from her waterie eyes: her brother
for his part, albeit he grieved with the desolation of his chaste sister, yet
the ^oye he conceived in her present consent to his demand, took away the
passion of that sorrow, feeling (as it were) some secret instinct or fore
warnyng of the happy success and effect of the liberal offer of ANGELIQVA, to
whom he excused his importunity in some sort after this manner, I was never so
gredie of life (says he) but I could be content rather to renounce nature and
dye, then to solicit the in any respect, which might bring thy honor or
reputacion in peril of infamous interest, neither would I live to se and much
less be partaker of the thing that any way seames to turn thee to
displeasure: which thou should always have found by effect and touch of
finger, if this liberal curtesye of our enemy had not procured me to wrest
the to that which honesty denies the to grant and I unable to demand
without great wrong to thy virtue, and no less prejudice to mine own honor.
And as the fear I have to be noted of ingratitude, has taken away al respects
of honor or honesty to us both, so the virtue and noble heart of ANSEAMO does
not only offer an assured argument of hope, but also presents absolute cause
of firm belefe, that the only displeasure thou shalt find in this enterprise
will appear when thou art first presented unto him: For it is not possible he
should use villainy on the behalf of her, the only regard of whose love has
made him make no conscience to hazard the displeasure of his parents and chief
friends, not refusing withal (without suit or importunity) to deliver him
whom he hated, and had power to put to what vengeance he would. Here may be
noted thoperacion of two extremities of several dispositions, natural zeal and
fraternal duty, quarellinge with womanly shame, and raison mentaining
co^tencion with in her self. ANGELIQVA knew and confessed that her brother did
no more then he ought, and that she was also leuiable to the same bond and
obligation of duty, and on the other part thestimacio^ of her honor with
regard to defend her chastetie, suppla^ted such dutiful respects of nature,
and forced her to an integrity of judgment, in that which she accounted both
unjust and unlawful, whereupon resolving to observe both the one and the other,
and seame chiefly to be thankeful to the demand of her brother, determined to
discharge him of the debte toward his long enemy and late friend, with intent
notwithstanding rather to die by the stroke of her own hands then
villanously to loase the flower of that which made her live famous, and of
greater renown then the most part of the ladies of that city. But the virtue
of this SALYMBINO is of more rare singularity and deserves a greater
co^mendacion, then the continency of CYRUS sometime king of PERSIA, who ^ering
a force of in^ysement to lorke under the flattering beauty of the fair and
common PANTEA would never suffer her to be brought to his presence, least her
wanton regardes should make him abuse the renown of his ancient honor, and
break the sacred deuocio^ which all men ought to use in marriage, with violacion
of his faith confirmed by former vow to his wife: For ANSEAMO enioyeng the
presence, with free commandment over her whom he loved no less then his own
life, did not only abstain to abuse the bountiful gift of his fortune, but
also declared an effect of more nobility and virtue of mind, then ye said
CYRUS, as you may note in the next act of this history atte^ding his present
discovery: for as the Montanyn and his sister had divided their deliberacio^
into certain points with abrigement at last of their long discourse, and
that the fair ANGELIQVA had stayed the source of her tears with expectation
of the end of that which they had but now bego^, ANSEAMO repaires from the
country to his pallais in the town, whereof at viij. of the cloak in the
evening Don Charles received advertisement, and without delay of further time
willed his sister to attire her self in the best order she could, with whom
and only one man (to carry a lantern of slender light) they went to the
lodging of SALIMBYNO, whose servant by chance encountered them at the pallais
gate of his master, not without astonishment to see them there with desire to
speak with Seigneur Salymbyno, who understanding what company the MONTANYN
brought with him, was not forgetful for his part to discende with expedicio^
having carried before him.ij. stafftorches, giving light til he came even to the
gate, where omitting no kind of curtesye in receiving ye brother, he was
barred (as it seamed) to expose any show of service on the behalf of her whom
he chiefly desiered to honor, but standing (as it were a man enchaunted or some
Hermit in expectation to hear the answer of his oracle) was no less
astonished with the view of his new gestes then if he had suddenly dropped out
of the clouds, which confusion and trouble of mind was immediately espied of
DON CHARLES, who as he imagined without great study, that the presence and
beauty of his sister sturred up ye perplexity of Salymbyno, so he went about
to break ye amaze with these words: Sir, says he, we have cause of special
conference with you which requires neither public audience nor other witness
then our selves, wherewith he offered them his chamber and became their guide
thither with more show of duty, then desiere to be entreated, and leading his
dear ANGELIQVA by the hand, passed through the hal into a certain gallerie,
furnished with riches and accotrementes belonginge to the greatness of his
estate, where being set in rich thaires and seats of honor, and the place
void of all company, saving, the presence of the ij. simple clyentes, and
merciful Montanyn to Seigneur Salymbyno.
judge, DON CHARLES MONTANYNO rise from his place, and spoke to the other in this
sort. Albeit the offers of servitude be always most hateful to freemen, and
that the noble heart can hardly brook to strike sail for any sommance of
adversity, yet the bond of a good turn or benefyt already don, leuieth such
alarams of remorce to the mind enuironned with virtue, that she forces not
only an equal co^sideracion and recompense, but also claymeth a continual
remembrance and thankeful recordacion in him, who was first partaker of the
benefyt, wherein as I find my self specially touched above all that ever was
blessed with friendship not looked for in this world: So Seigneur SALYMBYNO, I
hope you will excuse me if in the first place of my Catalogue of thankesgeuing
I honor you, (contrary to the laws and customs of our commonwealth) with the
title of Lord and master, saying the virtue of your self (declared in the
greatest distress that ever has or could happen unto me) does not only yield
you, by justice such title, but also challenges at my hand a bond of no
less dutiful and continual service toward you, then you expect of the
most drudge and slave that follows your train, for what disposition is more
detestable then the note of unthankfulness, or wherein are we bound to so
frank and prodigal an exposition of our selves and all that we have, as in the
remuneracion and return of the pleasures we have received by strangers
which I could enlarge with credible authorities of elder days, and confirm
by familiar experience of our age, sauinge that in supplienge the time with
repeticion of antiquityes I should defer yet longer the doing of that, which
I chieflye desyer to perform, but greuinge above all things that in the view
and remembrance of their virtues I find my self far unable to be equal or
excede any that ever were renowned or noted to be thankful, where in albeit
I have just cause to cry out of the malice of my for tune, not for bringinge
me so depely in your debt, (which I think was wrought by general consent of
the heavens but for that she has lent me such slender choice of means to
requite so great a curtesye, yet in appealinge to the virtue of your mind, I
doubt not to make you understand the greatness of my desyer, and whether
ingratitude be any way harbored in the heart of this poor gentleman, who
having but himself and the chaste will of his sister, (being both preserved
in entier by the only assistance of your favor makes hear a present of our
selves and all that belongs unto us with commission (Sir) to dispose of our
lives, lyuinges and honor in any respect it shall like you to ymploye them.
And because I am more then half persuaded that thonly respect of ANGELIQVA
has kindled the first coals of your desyer, causing a conversion of the
hate which descended unto you by inheritance, into a disposition to love that
which your predecessors despised mortallie, and for that by the heavy clogge
of our extreme misery, and hard condition of state, we are not hable to
shonne the name of unthankful, but by thassistance of her that first procured
the debte, she I say, who forced your liberality on my behalf is hear a
ready pawn for the satisfaction of that which I confess to owe unto you: it
is (Sir) my sister whom you see before you who to absolve the bond of us both,
does yield her self unto you with fre submission of her honor and life at
your pleasure. And I being her brother having her full and free consent in my
power, do make you a present of her, bequeathinge you no less property then
either I or she has of herself, with authorytye to disdispose of her as you
think good, dowtinge not but you will accept the offer, and respect the gift
according to the value, with remembrance from whence it came, and in what
sort it ought to be used: wherwyth not taryenge the reply of the other nor to
bid his sister farewell, he flonge down the steares, and went ymedyatlye to his
own house: if ANSEAMO were indyffrently amassed at the first arryual of both
the MONTANYNS, or astonnyed with the oracion of her brother, it is now that he
is double perplexed, both with the soddayn departure of DON CHARLES, and also
to see in his presence the effect of the thing he only desired, and never
was hable to ymagyn, and much less durst enter into hope to have it come to
pass, wherein as he was no less gladd, then he had cause, being in the free
contemplation and company of her whose beauty and virtue he accounted above
the respect of al commodyties and pleasures of the world, So he labored of
semblable dollor on the behalf of the passion and secret sorrow of mind
which he noted in her touching her present change of estate, the same
forcinge him also to a firm perswacion, that thaccidente paste proceeded rather
of the generosytie or to much show of courage and virtue in the heart of the
young man, then by consent or any contentemente at all to the fair ANGELIQVA,
whom at the same instante he took between his arms and proffringe certain
chaste kysses dried her watrye eyes of tears which ceased not to drop with
great abundance, preferringe unto her this kind of short consolacion. If ever
I felt or desired to understand with what wynge did fly the inconstant
gods, which the poets term the change and varyetie of thaffaires of the
Fortune (according to the poets) is the change and alteration of the world
ly affairs.
world, it is now (good Madam) that I am presented with such a manifest and
strange proof, that I dare skarcely believe that which I see in offer before
mine eyes for if the only respect of you, and service which my heart has
vowed and sworn unto you, has constranied me to dissolve the bond of
extreme hate, which by request of my parents I have been enjoined to bear to
you and your house, and in that devotion have delivered your brother as you
know from death, I see fortune denies me the tryumphe of the victory, for
that your brother has surmounted me in honor and virtue: And now do I see
that as the flatteringe gle of an uncertain fortune ought not to alter the
goodness of the disposition, so adversity is not hable to corrupt the virtue
of the noble mind, nor when the good torn is done the memory of the benefytt
is not hateful to the thankeful man: for albeit my example deserves
co^mendacion, for that I opened the way and became (as it were) your brothers
guide geuinge the first earnest penny of humanity between us, yet his
ymytacion seames meritorious of treble praise, for that he has not only
acknowledged my curtesye and returned it with doble interest, but also labored
to excede me in the true effects of sincere nobylitie: wherein for your part
being my vassal by your own consent and special gift of your brother) al be
it you have more reason of doubt then cause to reappose assurance in my
fydelytie, for that our new reconcilement is not yet confirmed with any
continuance of long time, nor our amitye iustefied but by one simple proof or
experience of late, yet shall your self be judge and ye whole world witness
with you, yt my heart is no less fre from corruption, then far from dishonest
or evil intent on your behalf, and that I pursewe but a consomation of that
which GOD has given as a dyuine sacrament and holy law amongst, us wherefore
says he (with a fresh charg of honest kysses) do away (good lady) your tears
of present dule, and despair no more of the perfect loialtie of your
servant who will deal no worse with you having you in his power, then at
such time as he languished on your behalf and durst not discover the desyer
he had to do you service, neither shall your brother repent him of his courtesy,
nor you in consentinge to obey him, for albeit you are mine by peculiar grant
and mutual accord, and that your fortune has given me such scoape of authority
over you that your honor waigheth only in ye ballaunce of my disposition, yet
the respect of mine own reputacion and honor that I owe to your virtue,
does defend you from other iniurye at my hand then in making you ye only
maistrys of my heart, to crave your consent in lawful marriage and societio of
wedlock whereby thaunciente mutynies and civil grudges shall not only Retire
and receive end, but our howses reioyned eftsoon with this indissoluble bond
of affynitye between us, shall live hereafter in contynuall quiet enioyenge a
mutual amytie more firm and strong on both parts, then the former quarrels
were fatal or full of mortalytie.

These news stayinge the course of wonted tears and dismissinge withal al
dollorous arguments or regardes of sorrow, sturred up such a complexion or
dye of natural white and read in the face of the fair SYENNOYSE that she
seamed rather a gods syttinge in her glistering troane then an ymppe or
creature of nature, forcinge such a vehemencye of desyer in the heart of
SALYMBYNO, that he was driven eftesones to give a second charg of her goodwil,
with a frank offer to make participation unto her of half his living and
richesse: wherewyth she presented him a semelye reverence with a majesty of
modesty and womanly behavior retorninge his request with thanks due to his
liberal offer, with further assurance for her part to omit neither endeavor nor
diligence nor declaration of duty on the behalf of him whom god has
reserved for her laweful husband and companion of bed, wherewith after they
had spent some little momente in embrasinge one an other and certain kysses
given and received recyprocallye between them, ANSEAMO knocked for an old
awnte of his lyenge in his house to whose charge and fydelytie, he committed
the glory of his new conqueste, and fyndinge the least momente of delay
greatly hurteful to his desyer dispatched ymediatlye several messengers to his
dear and nearest parents and friends, who obeyinge the expedition of his
short sommance, came ymediatelye unto his house, where he requested their
assistance of advise and company in the consommacion of a busynes of great
importance, wherein if they appeared willinge or liked of his request, he seamed
(I am sewer) to use above an ordinary seleritie in thexecuiion of his
enterprise, and sending for his awnte with her new charge and his dear
ANGELIQVA, repaired immediately (not with out the great amaze of his friends)
to the pallaies of the MONTANIN, where skarcely giuinge leave to the
interteynementes and proffers of court, wherewith DON CHARLES saluted him and
his company, he recited to his new brother in law in the hearing of the
rest, that as not long since, he with his sister came to his lodginge with
request to communicate with him in secret, so for his part, he is now there
before him to reveal such things as he hadd determined since his departure,
and that in the public audience and witness of that company which he hadd
assembled of purpose, and to whom with all the world, he intended to imparte
his rare honesty and virtue, with such revenge as himself mente to take
upon them as seamed to honor him with the offer of any pleasure, or
surmounte him in the gift of thank efull dealyng: which words seamed to end
as the whole company was set in order with erspectacion to see theffecte of
this mystery, and being all in scilence he turned his face with an oracio^ to
the multitude in these terms. Me thinks I see you all in a wonderful amaze

kinsmen and friends) nor my self hetherunto have ever set foot to enter
without desire to endomage or do some notable harm to the rest of them that
remain of the MONTANYN LINE, which astonishement I shall also suspende in
you, till the end of this short preamble, which, I have preferred for the
better understanding of the part I mean to play. And if you will consider
with regard of indifferent judgment, and waighe in equal balance, the thing
which is called good in the hearts of such as differrynge from the brutall
sort do follow the part of raison properly called spiritual, you shall see
by that mean that the generosytie and high heart grafted in us by our great
mystres and first mother dame nature, does never cease to make show of
several effects, sometime bringinge furthe one virtue, sometime making
declaration of an other, which also do prefer their sondrye fruits,

follows that as the greatness of fortune with glee of infynite riches do
lift up, and make swell the heart of a villain or one of base condition, So
the synister change of estate, nor any malice or ministers of pouertye, can
embase or make stowpe the greatenes of courage in them that are wroughte in a
contrary frame, or made of other stuff then the vulgar sort, for they keep
always a majesty of their original, and observe in such sort thinstincte

the very milk of virtue, that what dispites or malicious somonce soever

unto you (my Lords and Ladies) as a special prepratiue to the peculiar praise
and commendacion of the undoubted noblenes of mind of SIGNEVR CHARLES MONTANYN
and his sister, who without prejudice or wrong to any, may well be termed
the peragon for beauty and mirroer of honest and chaste behauioure, above all
the Ladies annd gentlewomen in our common wealth, whose house as you know
has been so oppressed with contynual persecucion, that only they two are
the last remeyndoures of their whole race, standinge also not long since at
the point of extreme ruin and utter subversion for ever, yet the ympocision
of such strange miseryes, cold neither move any dymunicion of courage, nor
stay of desyer to expose an effect of that virtue and bowntie which nature
has appointed to occupy the hearts of them that be true noble: wherein as
I see some justice to exclaim against the cruelty of our ancestors, for
that the only respect of a small broyle happeninge by chance, has moved them
to thonder a most mortal vengance of this so ancient and virtuous a stock: So

philosopher saying, that as of unlawful winninge of the father comes just

oftentimes a slave by Justice, I think it necessary not only to blow the
last retraite of all grudge between us, but also work the effect and
confirmation of a future amytie for ever hereafter, And if the view of
thauncient quarrels and mutunies of former time do stay your consent to
present compassion of their case, yet let not the honest trade of life, civil
behavior, and modest disposition of this brother and sister, depart without
the due mede and hyer of their virtue neither let us suffer their place in the
senate to be empty or void of supply, that earste has been furnished with
the presence of the most noble and wise men of our city, to the end that our
example may serve as a precedent to the future time, in that thonlye respect

sorowearyed with the length of a lingrynge suspense desyerynge to know the
cause of this great commendaciou of the MONTANYNS, with request to abridge my
tediouse discourse, if you will lend me yet a little liberty to speak, with
patience to hear the chief points of my protestation, the spedie end of my
tale shall restore present quiet and contentment to your trobled minds. It is
long since I must confess (and yet thoffence is neither mortal, nor falte so
heinous but it may be forgiven) that the beauty with other parts of perfection
in the fair Angeliqua here present, so ravished my senses and robbed me of my
liberty at one instant, that thonly exercise which occupied my head day and
night for a long time, was the sondrye devises I ymagyned to discover unto
her my martiredome, wherein I fedd the hongry humor of my affection, with such
alarams and contraryetie of conceits, that having by this mean lost the
necessary appetite of the stomach, and usual desyer of sleep, I felt such a
diminucion of nature and lyuelye force through all the parts in me, that I was
presented at one time with the choice of two most perilous evils in the
world, the one to dye before my time by suffocacion of pynnynge dollour, or else
to yield to a deprivation of my senses and gift of understanding for ever:
wherein I was also pursued with the ready assistaunce of perplexed despair,
for that I saw no mean to make that seame easy wherein I judged so great an
impossibilitye, chieflye by the grounded quarrels of our ij. houses, whereby
albeit the war seames ended, and the grudge half appaised between us, yet
was I of opinyon, that there remeined an equal desyer in the hearts of us
both, neither to wish well the one to the other and much less to abstain
from further slaughter, when so ever a new occasion should eftesones fall
out, neither could these mortal impedimentes argue sufficient raison to
diminish min affection, but sturred up rather a treble increase of desyer,
according to the passioned mind enchaunted with love, who makes such as he
possesses more apt to desire, then Love make us more apt to desire, then
hable to attain.
hable to attain to the effect of that which they wish, preferrynge always
a simple likelihode in that wherein appears an absolute impossibilitye, to
the end to afflicte their miserable lives with continual annoye: but as these
extremeties had filled my head full of despair and committed me to a
continual carefulnes of mind, because I could neither stay the course of my
affection, nor encounter the object of my desyer, behold fortune entered into
compassion of my state, assistynge me with so ready a medecin for my great
disease, that when I was void of all expectation or hope of recouerye, I was
presented with a frank offer of my desyered pray, for as it is not unknown
to you all that sense the departure of viij. or ten days, the Lord MONTANYN
here present, being accused before the SENATE upon certain peinall statutes,
devised by our cruel state for the rappeale of banished men, was awarded by
judicial sentence to pay the forfaiture, which because he could ont
nottender within the time, his greadie enemies forced ye law to a more rigor
then was necessary, in such sort as thexecutioner was ready to extend upon
his body for want of a supplye of a thosande florents, to choke the covetous
humor of the magistrates. Even so the view of his extremity sturred up such a
remorce in my mind that me thought I was sommoned by duty to prevent the
destruction of him, who was brother and thonly comfort of her whom I had
alredye proclaimed the sovereign Lady and mystres of my heart, in which good
vain of devotion I paid the money and procured his delyuerye, who (for his
part) deuinynge I can not tell upon what occasion, that the beauty of his
sister did work theffect of such a virtue in me, has not only been
thankful for the benefit, but also overcome me in honest liberality and
true noblenes of mind, presenting me in the beginnynge of this eueninge at
mine own house with a prodigal offer not only of himself and al yt he has,
but also of his sister whom he left with me to use and dispose at my pleasure:
wherein for end I appeal to you all with one request that in waighinge
rightly the gift of the one and offer of the other, you will consider of them
both, and assiste me immediately with your advise in what sort I may yield a
due meede to such ij. precious merits, the one a most familiar pattern and
precedent of true nobility, and the other a present of such price and value,
that the greatest prince in ITALY could do no wrong to his greatness in
yeldynge honor and homage to so rare a thing: whereupon he stayed his further
discourse, gyuinge place to thassistantes for consultacion of the case, which
albeit they knew imported deliberat advise before the resolution of judgment,
yet were they in amaze what sentence to give, because they were neither privy
nor partakers of the determinacion of him who had sommoned their appearance
there, rather to witness the fact then divide the case, or impeshe his resolute
intent by a contrary council. The Ladies his kynswomen were so moved to
admiracion with the majesty and other arguments of virtue in the fair
ANGELIQVA that they had passed judgment on her side if they had not feared to
be refused of him, who wished their voice that way, and who only being
touched above the the rest most near the quick, dismissed their astonishment
in reueilyng his own determination in this sort. Saying you take so great a
time to discuss so small a matter with no less doubt to publishe sentence of
that which is alredye determined let me abridge all arguments of further
delay in decipheryng in plain words the thing which hetherunto I have
communicated but by circunstance, ou shall understand says he (in taking
ANGELIQVA by the hand, that having the regard of honor before mine eyes, with
desyer to recompense at full the honestye and virtue of the brother. I am
resolved to take the sister to my dear and lawful wife, preferrynge by that
means a perfect unity of that which long time has lived in separacion, and

hope shall furuiue the length of time and not end but with the last remeinder
of either of our posterityes. This conclusion thus heard of the parents, and
kynsfolkes of SALYMBYNO, and canuaised alitle in their several opinions,
seamed at last of such reason and indifferency to them all, that they
converted their conceits which kept them occupied for a time into a present
disposition of wonderful joy and gladness feelynge in their intrals and
inward parts (I can not tell by what secret instinct of mind) an approach of
indissoluble tranquillity on all parts, by the only conjunction of this new
alliance. And albeit there was no equalitye of porcio^, and that ye dowere of
ANGELIQVA stood aloff from the revenues of her new consort, yet the virtue
and gifts of grace appearyng in her, made her seame hable to counteruaile him

not abused with a regard of richesse or other filthy promocious of the
world. And he that in the choice of his wife respects chieflye her beauty
and greatness of portion, (besides a thousand petty mutynies that fall out in
housekeping,) escapes seldom without a sprit of grudge or cyuill discension,
disturbynge his quiet with a continual humor of frettynge disposition
feeding his mind, for the glass of beauty retireth and gives place to age,
which also mortifyeth the delight or desyer of further pleasure, and on the other
side the woman knowing her descent more noble, and portion to excede the
welthe of her husband forgets not to take heart at grass, and deckynge her
garlande with all sorts of flowers of pride and disdain, seeks to govern
and get the upper hand of him, who as he is appointed her head by the
words of the scripture and institution of nature: So he ought to keep a
strait hand of the same bridle and Rain of authority, vsinge it as a chek

they see touched with the like grief. And for my part I lament the disquiet of
them, as would and can not, or rather dare not attempt a simple reformacion
in them who are borne to bear the yoke of awe and commandment of their
husbands, retournynge therewyth to the sequeile of SALYMBYNO, who workynge the
last effect and consommation of his curtesye, gave the one half of his goods
of all sorts in favor of the marriage, adopting at thinstant the MONTANYN as
his brother in law and assured friend, with general substitution to all his
goods, if he chanced to dye without heir of his body, and having children
he conueighed unto him by such assurance in reuercion as the law could
devise, that moytie, which he gave in dowerye to his fair ANGELIQVA, whom

also works often times an effect of that wherein appeared an absolute
impossibility of conquest by any other mean.

And truly the virtue of this example discredites utterly the commendacion of
the ancient ROMANS, amongeste whom as there chanced diverse times great
enimyties and grudge of mind, so there followed a spedie reconcilement (albeit
not by such means as this frank atonement between the SALYMBYNS and
MONTANYNS, but some were reclaymed by the offer of promocion, some solicited by
the voice of the whole commonwealth and confirmed by the present gift of some
notable office, and other with a regard to peculyar proffit, not one of them
all approchynge near the magnanimity in the worste of these three, whereof
the one sommoned by a passion of love scamed to excede nature in perfourmynge

frenzye, but such are rather abused with their own conceits, then hable to

the only mean, that moves us to moderacion when we are inclined to cruelty
or revenge, and the chiefest norsse and preserver of peace amongst men,
wherein if some vile disposition happen to violat or pervert the laws of so
necessary and ancient institution of nature, the virtue and subject it self
yet ought not be touched with the cause of such fault nor deserve to be
noted of any corruption, saying such derogation procedes by the abuse of him
that knows not the perfection of the thing, which falls out also in
experience in diverse other accidents, who being virtues of them selves, do
loase their credit, by the malice of such as abuse them vyllanouslye, whereupon
the good thing is often condemned by the folly of such as are ignorant in
the perfection of the same, in the other appears a rare disposition of a
bountiful mind, so far from the abominable spot of ingratitude, that his
life was ready to be offered for the satisfaction and discharge of the courtesy
if the other had required it, wherein as you may see great effects of true
magnanymitye, and wherein a noble mind ought not to be overcome with the
virtue of honest curtesye, so touching the price of the victory, I mean
which of the three is most meritorious of commendacion, and deserves to
wear the garland, I refer the judgment to thindifferencie of such as
without passion or parcialitye do use to note the chances happenynge to men,
you see a mortal enemy sorowed for the misery of his adversary, but
solycited thereunto (you will say) by the inevitable force of love, which
also wroughte his delyuerye: the other marched with the glory of a present so
rare, that the greatest Monarcke of the world may be astonyed with the
remembrance of his prodigal bounty. The wonderful zeal and affection of
the sister toward her brother chalengeth no less praise then the rest, who
albeyt she had seen a proof of the curtesye of her enemy, yet had she no
assurance of his modesty, notwythstandynge to discharge every way her duty
toward her brother she laid her virginitye upon the block of vyolacion:
the first claymeth to be victor, because his last virtue in the marriage
excedes his former courtesy, but he has overthrown his enemy and not won the
feelde, so that he is not to enjoy the praise or price of the victory. The
absolute resolution of the young Lady to kill herself, if she were forced to
dishonnour against her will, takes away all glory and commendacion from her,
if the care to keep honor and virginitye, did not prevail above the
preservation of life: the brother and third of this Crew, albeyt this prodigal
offer proceeded by compulcion of the former bountye of his friend, yet the
noblenes of his mind was equal to the rest, and his virtue nothing
inferior to either of the other two. And yet if it were not the singular
respect he had to return his benefytt with double interest, with care to be
more then sufficientlye thankful to his patron, I could dyminishe his
glory, wherein because the lamentable tragedye of two poor lovers so^mones
me to discover their misaduenture, with no less reason to furnishe the stage
with a declaracion of their loyaltye, then your Ladyship has alredye hard the
whole discourse of the rare virtues in SYENNA, I leave such Gentlemen and
skilful Dames (who take pain to skan this historye) to argue the cause at
large, and resolve judgment at leisure, not doubting of your integritye in
yeldynge the true title of tryumphe and glory to some one of the three, whom
you account most worthy to be crowned with the Laurel of victory.

FINIS.
The argument.
THere is nothing how good and profitable so ever it appear, whereon
attendethe not a discommodytie to him that deals in it without discrecion,
together with a perentorye displeasure in receiving it contrary to the consent
of good government wherein I may be assisted with sufficient confirmation in a
daily experience of the ordynarye meats, brothes, and other confeccions
tolerated by phizicke for the sustentacion of man, which albeit be good of
them selves, yet being swallowed in glottonous sort, they do not only procure
a surfeyt with unsavory indisgestion, but also converting our aunciente health
and force of nature into humors of debylytie destillinge through all the parts
of the body, do corrupt the blodde which of it self before was pure and
without infection: Even such is the disposition of love, whose effects,
directed by reason (which ought to guide every accion and doing of man) be
not such enemies in deed to the quiet of our life, as necessary means to
reform the rudenes of our own nature, according to the authorytie of the
poet affirminge that by love the rudeman is reduced to a cyuilitie, the fool
learneth wisdom, the cowarde becomes valiaunte, and the couetouse nigard

settes his purse wide open to his friend: neither is there any kind of
curtesye wherewith he that is in love does not participat: but who makes an
experience of the contrary, I mean without advise or judgment will throw
himself hedlonge into the golphe of a folishe and ronning phantasye, escapes
hardly without the reward which that frantike passion yeldeth ordenarely to
such as are vnhappelye partakers of such infection, neither is there any
thing more furthereth the ruin and dekaie of man then suffriuge the eyes of
our understanding to be seeled with such ymitate to ymate that as a glott of
our gredy desyers, which nature has enjoined to all estates to honor and
embrace as a special virtue. And truly me thinks that, that folishe and
infortunat crewe might reserve therrours and destructions of others as
special pattornes and precepts to restrain the humor of their own madness,
by the which (or they be aware) they are ledd to the brinke of mortal
destruction: albeit thindiscretion of that miserable sort seames nothing
unlike in comparaison to those that having long used the trade of theft and
robberye, and saying their companions pass by the sentence of a cord, lack
grace notwithstanding to disclaim the wickedness wherein they have been nozeled
so many years, neither is their plage (or rather just punishmente) any thing
inferior, for they making a chief glory of that which is most imperfecte
in love, are either so subject to despair, or beastely assotted with the
greedye encownter of the pleasure they find, that procuring by their own
folly and want of order the process of their fatal sommaunce in the entrey to
their felycitye, are forced to resign at one instante their life and loathinge
contentmente of less contynuance then the pains in love seame grievous to the
mind that has ye gift to pass them over by reason. And like as a vehement
and inward greffe of the mind (proceeding by the malice of a synister fortune,)
is of such force, to close the poares and couduictes of the vital parts of
man, that cancellinge the commission of life, the soul departes leauinge the
body without sense, like power I say has the vehemency of semblable gladness,
which occupienge all the parts with a general joy (exceeding the strength of
nature) makes the mind insufficent of force to withstand so great a passion,
whereby strykinge the sail of life, the body is seen to vanishe as the
candle lackinge wax or weak or other matter assistinge the flame which gives
light to the beholders, whereof we have diverse authoryties in the histories of
antiquitye, as one of the daughters in law to the high priest Helye who
hearing of the death of her husband and the taking of the ark of the lord
ended her life with the dollorous reapport: the like happeninge unto her father
in law for the overthrow of the children of Israel by the infydelles and
uncircumcised: in like sort we have confirmacion in diverse profane
discourses of such as have yielded the ghost in a trance of unreasonable joy
and lawghiuge, as Dyagore Rhodiotto, and the philosopher Chilon, who upon the
news that their children had won the prise at the plays at Olympus embrased
their happy fortune with such exceeding gladness, that upon the place and
present they yielded again their term of borrowed years, also a folyshe
Roman woman hearing of the death of her son in a battle fought against
thennemy, disgested it with great constancy, but seeing his safe return from
the field contrary to her expectacion and former news she was so assailed with
superfluity of gladness that in place to congratulate his delivery from the
peril of war she dyed in embrasing him as of a passion of dismeasured
contentme^t, which argues sufficiently the folly of them that in any degree
bestow either joy or sorrow so near their heart, that besides the destruction
of the body they become thunnatural morderers of their own souls wherein with
what enamel so ever they seek to guild and color such vices yet can they not
be excused of an humor of madness proceeding of a vain brain exposing fruits
according to ye spirit or guide ye possesses them, neither is there any
commendation at al due unto such as through ympacience give end to their life
by despair, with what title or sorname of constancy the fond philosophers of
old time do baptyse those accions of meare fury and frenecy, whereof as the
miserable end of these. ii lovers yeldes sufficient testymonie dieng both in
one hour of diverse accide^ts the one of a dismeasured joy the other of a
passion of desperatte sorrow, so because the discourse is of undoubted troth I
wish it might move credyt to the reador and council to al men to eschew the
like inconuensence deryued of semblable occasion.

THE LONG AND Loyal Love between Lyuyo and Camylla together with their
lamentable death, the one dying of a passion of joy the first night he
embraced his mystres in bed, the other passed also the same way as overcome
with present sorrow for the death of him whom she loved no less then her
self.
AT such time as ALEXANDER the sixth surnamed BORGIA supplied the papistical
seat at rome, dwelt in SYSENNA a young gentleman called LYVYO with his sister
CORNELIA, near unto whom was the house of a knight bering ye name of RENALDO,
having a son called CLAVVDIO with a daughter CAMYLLA, which two young dame
selles, by reason of neighborehead and contynuall norryture together duringe
their infancye, retained a league of such mutual famylyaritie and
conuersacio^, yt their socyetye with often intercourse together seamed no less
then if nature had made them the children of one father, wherein as R^NALDO
and his wife reioysed not a little on the behalf of their daughter, for that
CORNELIA was accounted to excede the rest of young Ladies in honest behavior
and gifts of virtue: So if it had not been for a froward disposicion in
CLAVVDIO, (who grudged without cause the company of LYVYO) this conversation
and haunt of the girls had seamed of easier continuance: Albeit as his
presence gave often ympedimente to their metinge, so his absence restored their
enterviewe, in such sort, as he was no sooner departed to parforme his fathers
affairs at Rome or else where, but his sister forgot not to visit her dear
CORNELIA, passinge their petty follyes and recreacions of honest delight most
commonly at the lodginge of LYVYO, for that there was neither awe of father nor
other authority to control their exercise, which for the most part was every
after none to dress fine banquetes, striving to excede one an other in
curiositye and conning with a thousand other conceytes and merye cha^ of
huswiferie, which seamed of no less pleasure to them, then the pomppe of
wanton delytes wherewith princes and other great Ladies are respected, served
and honored, and some time courted by a crew of veneryan and carpet knights

most famyliar experience in this LYVIO, who during the practis of the two
girls, took such view of the beauty and behavior of CAM^LLA (seeing her only
go, and come to the chamber of his sister,) that he began to sipp of the Cup

passion, in such sort as not knowinge whether he should encounter a return

his folly, he accomptes it a great symplicitie to desist before he have
performed every effect and suggestion of the blind guide that governs his
unruly will, for this young Pigeon of the first plume, hatching in the secret
of his mind that, which he durst not discover, took singler pleasure in the
repetycion of the delight which he desiered, ymagining that CAMILLA had cropped

disclayme all company and places of assembly, and accounted his greatest
felycitie to discourse with his thoughts in the open and barraine feldes, where
only the air did witness his dollor and the birds partakers of his hollow
sighs, wherein walkyng one day (among the rest) a long a Coppies or Grove of

procedes this new authorytye which commanndinge the strongeste part in me,
seameth to force a desire to wish that whereof mine eyes have already given
judgment touching the bewtye of thonely mistres of my thoughts? what
soddayne alteration is this to transform my liberty into a servile thraldom,
and yet of more delight and contentement then if I were pronounced thonely

effect of that which is parfecte under the corporal veil can not be
discerned but by figure and force of ymagynacion, the which rauishinge my
senses has made me the slave of her, who living without subjection or touch
of passion, may peradventure convert the SYMPTOMS of my present grief into a
conceyte of little or no regard, with adisdayne of thoffer of my affection. To
what end should I endeavor to gather the fruit, when the leaves will grant me
no favor, or who will bend his devotion toward the shryne, if the saint

to discover my grefe, I have cause to despair of the remedy, and in fedinge
only upon vain and uncertain ymaginacions, I am to expecte no other
contentment but such as distilleth from the fountain of such simple favors,
that now I find them the happiest kind of creatures to whom nature has
ymparted such rude shappe and gross understanding, that they cannot in any
sort receive thimpressions of love, where we alas that are deryued of a more
delicate molde and enjoined to a generositye of spirit above the rest are
barred the beuefyt of all felycitye in admittinge as a principal pleasure ye
thing which torments us more mortallie then if we were persecuted with all
thafflictions of the world. Herein appears the folly and want of discretion
in man doatinge upon the vanities and passions which of him self he plants
in him self, without foreseinge how unable he is to restore his quiet
after he be once attainted with the humor of such corruption. But what? may
any one man be assisted with special privilege in that which nature has made
common to us all, I mean is it in the power of any to procure dispense from
the danger of love, or stay the coals kindled in our intrailes to burst into
blase or open flame? no no, for of a million that have fallen into the snares
and perils of affection, I have not known any one that has disposed of him
self and thoughts, other ways then according to the discretion of him that
sekes to mortifye our quiet and triumph in the seruilitye of us wretches, yet
for my part saying there is no evil in embrasing things that be fair, for
that (according to thoratour) the fair and good are so conjoined together that
the one Cicero
glorifyenge in the other are confirmed both with equal estimation, why should
I not pursue the love of my dear CAMILLA, whose exterior regardes argew a
greater virtue then to refuse the offer of my simple and honest service,
supported with an intent of unfeigned loyalty so long as nature shall assiste
me with one moment of time in this world. But alas what reason has she to
grant to that which I dare not demand, or how should she satisfye my
request, being altogether ignoraunte of my meaning, and seeing by
conceylinge my desyer, my grief is grown to an agrauacion of torment, why
stay I to disclose the cause, to the end I may either receive the sovereign
CATAPLAME for my sore, or else the last and fatal syroppe, which may send
me to complain mine evil in the other world: wherein as he made here his plat
to communicate his love with his mistres, so the very presence of CAMILLA and
fear to offend her, took away theffect of that resolucion, conuerlinge his
complot into a mystery of some dream or vision invisible, whereby what with
the increase of his passion and fear to bewraye thoccasion, his grief grew
to a disease presentyng arguments of debilitye and diminutio^ of strength with
lose of ancient color in his face so far forth, yt he seamed not the same
LYVIO which erst was so welcome into all companies, no less for his grace and
perfection of nature, then his guifte of pleasante discourse, saying that now
in so short a time he is so transposed into the habit and disposition of a
malencolike and solitary harmit, that there appeared no less impossibility
to have him assiste any assemblye according to the commendable custom of
nobility or youth of gentle discente, throw all the franchises in ITALY, then
to mortifye in one instante the furye of his solitary passion, in such sort
that the young Ladies and gentlewomen companyons to his sister, began to
deskande of his coye and religious trade of life, some of them (accusinge him
of folishe disdain), noted a sort of savage and hagarde disposition, and some
saying as fare into his disease as the phizicion into his water, referred the
cause of this soddaine change to the mortal and inevitable wounds of the
cruel son of the fair CYPRIS, wherewith CORNELIA, troubled without measure
that the alteracion of her brother was the only wonder of the multitude,
greuyng no less for her part, then the rest seamed amazed, accoasted him one
mournyng in a close arbore or alleye of his gardin where he was recording his
amarous co^ceits, and disposed her self tunderstande the cause under these
terms. I hope says she my present coming (excedyng my Cornelya to her
brother.

chiefly for that I desire to communicate with you in that which your self ought
to disclose to such as are dear unto you, to the end that if the mean to
restore you consiste in strangers, the remedy may follow with expedicion, but
if a sleighte slave may cure a slender sore and that your grief is of no other
consequence then a passion of ymaginations, why do you not take up the vain
that fedes the humor of such fond conceits, and of your self dismiss the
dark clouds of your troubled fancy. For I assure you the shame which I
have on the behalf of your doing is nothing inferior to the panges you feel,
chiefly for that your solenme trade of life ringing in mine cares by a general
reaporte of all men, makes me not only refuse diverse asse^blies which I ought
to visit, but also loath the company of my dear companions, who forget not
to reproach me with imputacion of our change, protesting unto you that if you
confirm it with any longer time I will also assiste your solitary trade, and
keep my self so recluse, that in forbearing to visit my friends abroad, I will
also forbid thaccesss of any at home: for what delit do I find in any company
when al degrees salute me with your desolate order of living, and judge you
what pleasure I take that erst did glory with the best, in ye behauior of my

as he bears his misery best that hides it most, so such are worthy to
have the name of perfect men, who enconteringe their disaster with a constante
magnanimitye of mind, do dissimule their grief before the world, to the end
they only may give remedy to that which is common to none but them selves,
wherein for my part I could never enjoy a participation of such perfection,
neither is thoccasion of my extremity so easily covered but the drouping
regardes in my face are ready to make declaration of my torment, besides I
have no great cause of shame of mine evil, consideringe the same importes an
enterprise of noble consequence, albeit I make some conscience to discover the
principal cause. But considering the roundnes of your offer, and how boldly
one of us may participat with an other I am content to imparte with you the
circumstance of my passion, wherein as you have charged me with change and
alteracion of countenance, debilitie and diminucion of the strongest parts in
me, with a savage and hagarde order of living as you have termed it, so in
understanding the cause, I hope you wylexcuse me of effects of other folly
then such as nature has enjoined in generaltie to all men, and to cut of your
suspense and absolve your troubled mind of all doubt, you shall understand
that the force of love (depriuinge mine aunciently berty) has also transposed
my former quiet and solace of mind, into these mourning and pynynge regardes
which you note in me, neither can I be restored to the state which you wish
without the assurance of that which I desire, which is the good will of her
to whom love has be given so large power over me. And as every medecin is
measured by the greatness of the disease, and the light hurt is easelye healed
without tryinge the exquisite skill of the Physician, so my grief being
grounded upon great consequence, does not only assail me withal sorts of
passions and panges of sorrow, but also denies to brook the operacion of
other remedy but such as is distilled from the earbe that first infected me,
it is not the offer of small harms, that makes me so hurtefull to my self and
hateful to my friends, nor the subject of tryflynge annoye that sturres up
these sighs and solytarie disposition in me, it is alas for beautye her felfe
that I suffer, eye the very pattern and goddess of all perfection, has made
me so forgetful of my self that I seame a stranger to my dear friends,
neither have I other power of my self, then such as is imparted unto me by
her whose picture I carry so lively in my mind: CORNELIA altogether ignorant in
the force of affection, and by reason of the greenes of her years voyed of
experience in tournynge over the volumes of love, could not but smyle for the
first at they argon or discourse of her brother, albeit notinge his
perpleritie, she let fall also certain tears on the behalf of his desolate
state, and seeing him wholly converted into contemplation of a vision, judged
it an effect of pitye to give aid to his distress, whereupon she desired
eftsoon in merry sort to know the goddess of his de^ ocions, to the end
(says she) that I may yield her honor for your sake, and saying you dare not
present her your request, I may enter into the office of an intercessour,
and pray for your delyuerye, neither need you doubt to disclose her to me,
nor despair of my dilygence and ready endeavor to do you good, onles you be
so far spente with Ialous passion that you fear, I will rausshe her from you,
or preuente the desire of your pleasure in being in love with her my self, you
abuse ye loyaltye of my meaning, and I do wrong to exact so far upon rour
secret imagination: I am co^tente says he you I est candtake pleasure in the
eusll which I suffer, so that you will perform the effect of your promise,
which you may the rather accomplish by the credit you have with her who is
the only cause of my tormente, whereof after she had given him a second
assurance by oath and protestation of faith, he told her (not without a
fresh supply of sorrow) that it was CAMILLA to whom his liberty was captile,
and in the balance of whose compassion wayghed indifferently, the license of
longer life, or sentence diffinitiue of present death, desierynge her for end
to make her privy to the pain he endured, and with all to procure spedie
moderacion of his grief, or else to awarde the writ of fatal somonce to him
that is not hable to feed the vain of life without the food of her special
favor: The gyrle delityng still in the amarous discourse of her brother,
willed him to take heart at grass and making exchange of his solytarle order
to a wake out of his dream of dompes and revoke his disposition of ancient
cherefulnes, least his mistres loathing his thyn and wearishe looks be
affraide to grant love to a Stoane or suffer her self to be embrased by one,
in who me is neither present delight nor likelihod of future pleasur. Ah sister
says he how your liberty of tongue argues your small experience in cases of
love, whose delites consiste in tears, sighs, and dolorous complaints,
wherein as such as be most constante of all, make declaration also of effect
of such loyalty in taking pleasure to record their sorrow, with tunes of
lamentable note, so in exposinge the contrary, we discover at unawares the
slender affection we bear to the thing we desire, and for my part I feel no
less pleasure by ymagination, when I see with the eyes of my mind the beauty
and other perfections of my dear CAMILLA, then you which never tasted of the
apprehension of this free constrainte which the destenie of love has
appointed to attend upon me: I am glad says she to be warned in this sort to
eschew the like evil in my self, and sorry to note the experience of so
great an inconvenience in you, but seeing you are so sewerly rampired in your
folly, that thoffer of persuasion is hateful unto you, I am content you feed
upon such ease as you find, and take pleasure in the simple contemplacion of
the image of your Saint, for, for my part, I had rather have an hour of
rest, disposinge my self to sleep as soon as my head and the pillow be met,
then lie with mine arms of cross regarding the course of the stars, and
build castelles in the air, or be troubled in dremyng of the dissolution of
the world, and then to baptize such impediments and enemies of rest by the
name of the pleasures of loyal lovers, with addition that it is a peculiar
glory given them from above by the invisible goddess, it is a pore repaste
God knows for an empty stomach to feed only of wishes, and satisfye his
thirst with drinkinge of an empty cup, or restore heat to the benommed
parts by a cold chymney, or satisfye the desieringe mind with simple
contemplacions, wherewith, she retired with intent to try the next day,
whether CAMYLLA had any vain that stretched to satisfye the desire of her
brother, whom she left with more argument or consolation then before, by
reason of the hope he reaposed in her diligence. Here was a double offense in
LIVIO both to force his sister to an enterprise indecent for her honor and age,
and also to prefer her to be the DARIOLETTA of his love, opening (as it were)
the way of voluptuous pleasure to al youth yt which is to much inclined that
way by the corruption of our own nature, without that we need thassista^ce of
art to supply our defaultes in so dishonest an ercercise, albeit our blindness
is so great in things of such folly, that (in respectinge only ye present) we
never fear ye fall of future inconvenience, til being served with ye writ of
present penance It is necessary to know the impersectious of the world.
we find to little leisure to repent so great offenses, and albeit (according
to Aristotle) it is necessary to be privy to thimperfeuions in the world and
to know some time wherein we offerde, yet gives he this council with all that,
we convert the experience of such synister encounters, to a peculiar defense
of our selves against thassaultes of semblable accidents, and not to use it
as an authority or privilege to justify our wickedness or consume our time
in the ymitation of evil, wherein as the good men are defended by their
virtue, so let the worser sort be ware by so many millions of examples as our
unhappy age at this present is hable to furnishe in the like affairs. And so
to our history, the morrow after this discourse between the dolorous LYVIO and
his sister, it chanced that the daughter of RENALDO came all alone to see her
companyon CORNELIA, who albeit was sufficiently mindful of her promise, yet
was she furthered with a fit occasion by CAMYLLA, for that after certain little
devises between them she asked the cause of the sudden change and alteracion
in her brother, and why he was no more seen to assiste the honest assemblies
in masque or other sort, to whom CORNELIA answered, that as she was of
equal desyer to know thoccasion of his solitary absence, so greuynge above
the rest with his pyning estate, I have asked (says she) the cause of his
grief: which with the circunstance and effect of all his annoye procedes from
you (my dear friend and companyon,) as one in whom is norished the care and
travail of mind of my sorrowful brother. How is it possible says the simple
CAMILLA that I should work him any woe, saying hitherunto I have been no less
careful of his well doing, then curious of mine own health, neither have I
said or don the thing (I am sewer) wherein was any point of evil meaning
toward him, unless he make construction of my simple and honest zeal, like
as also I would be sorry to be the author of his miscontenteme^t any way: the
present passion of my brother says CORNELIA is derived of a contrary cause,
for the to much delight and pleasure he has taken in saying you, has
brought him to the brinke of this bane, and yet as they write of the SCORPION
he hops to draw the remedy from her that has given him the wound. If
you make not a more plain exposition of your dark text, says CAMILLA I
shall hardlye read the misterye of your readle, for as yet I understand
nothing but high duche: eye marye says the other and therein consists the
chiefeste cause of my grief, for if the peculyar affliction of my brother were
common also to you, or that you enjoyed but a simple perticipacion of his
annoye, you should not only understand that which I am driven to unfold,
but be as ready to give the remedy, as he has reason in the mean while to
suffer the grefe, or I ashamed to be the messenger. Do away this philosophy my
dearefrende (says CAMILLA and cut of at last my doubtful suspense
touching your meaning, for if thuttermoste of that which is in me may
stand him in stead, I will either perform the full of your demand, or at
least yield you such reason to the contrary, that you shall be void of just
cause to complain of mine answer. Here CORNELIA told her that thorigynall
of her brothers evil proceeded of a wonderful vehemencye of love he bare to
her, with addicion that if she yielded him not the hyer of his zeal with a
counterchaunge of affection, she should see in short time the end of his
life no less desperatelye, then in secret sorrow he consumes the best of
his age in the loyal servitude he has already vowed on her behalf, and for
my part says she (not without some tears) as the violence of his passion
(only known unto me) has forced me to stand here thunseamely solycitor of
his cause, so if it be a virtue to expose compassion upon thafflicted, let
the respect of my dystresse stir up an increase of pity in you to aid
the desolation of my careful brother: behold (my CAMILLA) the circumstance of
my present extremity, and ymagyn that with the loss of my brother dekaieth
the only proppe and pillor of my life, and yet (simple girl that I am boide
of experience in such affairs lo here I am constrained to build requests no
less inconvenient to my estate, then vnseamelye for my years, albeit for my
purgacion to wardesyou, I hope the law of nature and love of the sister to
wards her brother will excuse this diligence and endeavor which I use to
preserve the life of him whom I hold no less dear then the tendrest part of
mine eye, wherewith CAMILLA not without arguments of some little femynine anger
staide her further discourse with this answer: who would have thought says
she that a gentlewoman of your qualytie and calling would have exceded the
lymittes of her estymacion so far, as for the respect of the folishe appetit
of a young man to discharge the part of a shameless messenger in a case no
less unworthy for your honor, then contrary to me to whom thimbassage is
dressed? art thou so credulus in the constancy of men (mine own CORNELIA)
that thou will repose good earnest in that wherein they take pleasure to
dissemble? or art thou of opynion that as often as the iolytie of frail
youth do prefarre sighs, and traunces with other dollorous regardes painted
by dissymuled policy in the forefront of their faces, that it is true love
that possesses (...) the true messengers of the dollor of the heart.
them, or honest desire that moves their dule? nothing less, for albeit
tears for the most part are the true messengers of the dollour of the heart,
and ought chieflye to move compassion, yet in cases of love they be but
suborned signs and declaracions of wanton desire, and for that cause ought
not to receive other meede, then their meaning does meritte, seeing wythall
that the desierous mynte grounds his pretense most commonly upon the thing
which virtue can not brook, and reason denies to grant. And admit it
be a folly peculyar to many, and a passion ymparted to all men by nature to
follow, thinstinct of love, what grudge of conscience I pray you is it to a
maid to suffer her vain lover to pyne upon creaditte, so that she stand
so surely upon the guard of her chastetie, that she be not seduced with his
flattering charms? it is not in our power to let them to love: only we
ought to be careful of our honor, and shon thinfection least we become
unhappy before the time, besides how greatly should we abuse our duty and
obedience toward our parents in passinge a grant of our good will
without their consent, which only ought to direct us in any sort
whatsoever. No, no, let them almente and measure their mourning at what
intereste they think good, the same shall not stay the course of my sleep,
neither shall their tears eclips ye least moment of my pleasure and
contentmente, for when all is said, we ought to conster the meaning of these
feigned sorrows to none other end, but as privy baits to entangle the simple
and delicate youth of us women, for when we ymparte compassion to their
doleful alarams, and makes them the masters of their desiers, God knows the
reward we find, and how sone they laughe at our fragilitie, and taking
pleasure to see us in passion, do leave us pore wretches to the hyer of our
folly, So if LYVIO have yinagyned a bargain of love, let him make much of
his own conceit, and embrace the shadow of his fancy, for, for my part it
shall suffice me to be armed with resistaunce and that I am void of desire to
encownter him or any other in that sort, wherewith contenting my self with the
honest amytie between you and me (my dear CORNELIA) I conjure you by ye virtue
of the same, to give over ye pursuit of this quest, saying that (besides the
loss of time and slender proffit you are like to reap of your travail) you
shall also lose a companion of me with small commendation to your self, in
courtinge the gestes that hawnte your house with requests of such vnseamelye
effect: which last resolution stuck greatly on the stomach of CORNELIA, for
that the disdainefull repulse of her companion argued a despair hereafter to
ease the distresses of her brother but chiefly she grieved in that CAMYLLA
seamed to enter into synister conceits against her, which, with an honest
shame of that which was already passed her mouth and fear any more to
offend that way, together with her ignorance in the ordynarie replies of
such as have taken de grees in the skoole of love, made her prefarre her
excuse in simple sort with promise hereafter to disclayme thenterprise, and
blaming wholly thymportunytie of her brother desiered notwithstanding her
CAMILLA, not to discontynue her custom of repair to her lodginge, whereunto
she condiscended and retired to the pallais of her father leaving CORNELIA in
disputacion with her self what answer to forge to her desolate brother, who
as soon as he understood of the retire of his mistres, addressed him to his
sister, whom because he saw in the attire of sorrow I mean her eyes bathed in
ye tears of her late repulse, he gave judgment ymediatlie upon the case with
firm prerswacion that CAMILLA did not only deny his request, but also
misliked with ye messenger in performing her promise, the force of which
conceits drove him into a passion of alterations and change of color, not
without some argument of mortal peril to his person, before he demanded to
hear the answer, which being not unmarked of ye girl, she prevented thoffer
of further danger, with a contrary of that which CAMILLA told her, and for
fear of further inconvenience by his soddayne trance declared unto him, that
albeit his mistres was not so quick of conset, as hisextremitie required, yet
her heart was not so hard frozen, but there were means to thawe it, neither was
her answer without hope, although at the first she seamed to obiecte the
disloyalety and ordenarye ficcyon of men, willinge him for the rest to abandon
despair, and arminge him self with courage, to dysmisse his solytarie and
savage order of life, wherein for a more increase of uncertain consolation she
told him that albeit it was as yet but the foxemone, and that he had no reason
to advance him self so far as to crave mutual conferrence, yet he need not
forbear, to write to her, and that with the consent of time and place she
would deliver the letter, with inde uor to bring her last resolution, where
with albeit she seamed only to feed the time with intent to make him
discontynue his fancies, attempting notwithstanding a wonderful
ympossibilitie for that he was so stalled in his amarus golphe, that all the
pilottes belonginge to the infynit galies of VENICE lackt force to hale him
out, yet seamed she thereby to breathe an air of fresh comfort into all the
parts of her languishinge brother, who likinge her advise determined to put
her council in execution, whervppon as one of superficial skill in writing
thytalyan verse, he composed a certain ELEGY containing the some of his
sorrow and substance of his request, whereof because I have not the true copy,
I leave it to the judgment of them that have redd it, but thus much I
presume of his sorrow, that he did not end his epistle with out an infynitie
of tears, ympartinge the wateris dew of the same on diverse parts of the
paper, to the end the same might argue to his Lady the dollor of his passion
that governed him duringe the time of that contemplacion, which approved
sufficientlye his folly with declaracion how well they be beguenned that be
coyffed with a night capp of such stoofe as wrapped the empty head of our
LYVYO who failed not the next day to deliver his tragical letter to his
sister with great charge of expedicion in presenting it to his mistres.
(CORNELIA here was doble passioned, both to see her brother persevere in his
folly, without intermission of tormente; and also that she was forced to
perform a second embassage to her, whose company and frendshippe she was
sewer to abandon for ever, if she added new terms to her former request,
but if she had been as well seen in the subtilities of love, as she seamed most
simple in experience in that art, she would have considered, that what angry
clouds soever appear in the face of women, yet take they a singular pleasure
to be courted, and are not so angry in deed as their countenance does argue,
when their servants do visit them with letters of humylitie. And differringe
in this sort certain days the delyuerie of the letter, fearinge that which
happened, that if CAMILLA refused to perform theffecte, the danger of her.
brother cold be no less, then either present death by despair, or at the
least to enter in some mortal sickness, yet being pressed with his contynuall
ymportunyties, the pore girl determined to try she forde and sound eftesones
the heart of CAMILLA who (as it chanced) came the same after none to see
CORNELIA, where after they had made an experience of their skill in a banquet of
curious co^fections, CORNELIA not unmindful of the disease of her brother, and
seeing thoffer of opportunity for that the place was void of ympedimente of
company sauinge the two girls, drew the letter out of her poket and with a
smilinge regard, ^ntermedled with honest shame, gave it to CAMILLA,
desieringe her to read it, and judge what be the follies of lovers, CAMILLA
imagining by and by from what part thimbassage was sent, told her in sort
of pleasante anger that as she was not ignorante in the meaning of that
mystery and that if it were not more for the respect of the bringer, then
disier to content him that sent it, and that she was passed the fear of any
charm contained in the same, she would commit it to a thousand morselles
in her presence, So if the readinge brought cause of miscontentment, she gave
her assurance to perform thuttermoste of her former promise. CORNELIA
alleged ignorance in the matter, only says she I can thus far assure you
that I have not in charge to present you with letter or message from any man,
for as I found it this morninge upon the steares goinge out of my chamber,
so I hope you will neither enjoin me blame nor penance for the falte wherein
mine ynnocencye is suficiente to clear me. Well well says CAMILLA, I will
not stick to give you the readinge of these amarus lives arguinge as small
pleasure to him that write them, as evil received of me to whom they are
dressed, wherewith she opened the pacquett and redd the roll from ^hone end to
the other, wherein albeit she discovered in her fa^ce a singler pleasure beginning
even now to feel the motions of love with in her tender breast, and taste of
the appetit of a desire which she durst not satisfy, yet using her accustomed
wisdom in conceylinge that she desired most, she covered the suspicion of
affection with certain terms of reproach which she bestowed upon her simple
companion in this sort: I find now says she that my patience and facility
in hearing your reaportes, do yield you to much favor in furtheringe your
fond practice, which you need not go about to coollour with other enamell then
the complexion of your own nature, saying, that she with whom you have to do,
can spy a flee in ye milk, and give judgment of thintente of these baits
with theffecte of your meaning, desiering you (for preuentyng a further
inconvenience in your brother to seek to cure his disease as you may, least in
contynuinge his folly, he further a subuercion of that which is the best
part in him for he has already of me as much as he may hope for with
assurance, And for your part* as you seame to reappose neither religion nor
virtue in promises, for that the last time, we wear in terms of these
follies, you gave me assurance to discontinue thenterprise, So it is I that am
ready to give punyshmente to mine own indiscretion, and endure the penance of
mine own rashenes, in depriuinge me of the company wherein I took most
pleasure and contentmente, biddinge you fare well till better occasions may
restore our famyliar visitacions, wherewith she put no difference between doing
and saying, fearing that if she had attended the reply of CORNELIA, she had
been in danger to yield to the bargain, in opening her ears to wide to the
perswacions of her companion, whom she left no less astonished, then her self
traunsed and full of diverse ymagynacions, beginning even then to measure
thaffection of ^IVIO, and give judgment of his loyalty by the contynuacion
and vehemency of his passion, with absolute resolucion (for all her dissymuled
disdain) to change purpose and admit the offer of his friend ship, if she
were eftsoon required by him or any in his be half, blaming her rashenes in
reprochinge his sister, and cruelty more then: conueniente to her brother,
who began even now to take possession of her thoughts, and make him self a
secret mediator in his own cause, wherein sewerly may be noted in experience
of the fragilitie and inconstante disposition of man, and specially in
thaffaires of love, seeing that she which earste detested every way to be
pertaker of such ympression, is now changed in a momente and brought to lay
her head under the yoke of servile affection, making (as it were) a simple
and plain table of her heart, to the end to draw thereupon a form of
thoughts and ymagynacions in diverse colors according to the direction of
him that thus has got the government of her liberty, with authority to
dispose of her as he thinks good, And yet I cannot but allow her long
delaie, and judge her of great wisdom to suspende her consent till she had
well considered of the matter, saying the daily inconveniences happeninge to
such as neither careful of their honor, nor curious of their quiet, do admit
indescretly the bargain at the first offer, without knowinge the merit of
the persons, or examynynge the circum stancye of the future sequeile of their
love, whereof are derived so many examples of a number of miserable men endinge
their lives by unhappy despair, whose wretchedness ought to warn us to
delibrate at large before we put in execution, and to use a reasonable mean in
our doing, I mean not to ron hedlonge into the golphe of affection, least
our danger be equal to the peril of ye unfortunate ACARESTRYANS who because
they were disfaudred of their ladies, entered into such conceits of mortal
grefe, that when they would willingly have retired and been delivered, it was
either ympossible or at least veraie hard to give them remedy, to which crew
of desperate lovers we may well add the desaster of this LIVIO who assured of
thaunswere of his Lady, as well by his sister, as also by the regards of
disdain he noted in her farewell when she departed (whereof he was partaker by
shrowdinge himself in a secrette corner of the chamber duringe the perley of
the two maids) fell ymedyatelye into so strange a sickness that aband onynge at
the first the desyer of sleep, with the appetit of the stomach he left the
phizicions at the end of their wits: who being void of skill to cure his
disease told his friends that if he would not receive compfort of him self,
his life was in hazard, for that his evil proceeded only of passions and
inward sorrow of the heart, wherein they had reason seeing that the disease of
love is contrary The disease of Love contrary to the disposition of other
griues.
to the disposition of all other greues, for as there is no distress what
extremity so ever it importe but it may be either cured or qualefied by
certain drogues and confections devised by art to compforte the stomach and
restore the heart to a gladness, so the pacient plunged in the passions of the
mind, can neither broke thassistance of Phizicke nor operacion of herbs,
only the presence or simple word of his mistres, has more power over his
evil, then all the mystical or artificial powders devised by the most
expert phizicions that ever came out of thuniuersity of PARIS or PADVA whereof
thexperience apperes in this LIVIO, who languishynge every day from evil to
worse, consumed by pecemeale with the force of his amarous fire, no less then
the snow lying upon the side of a mountain yeldes and wastes with the heat of
the son, which also forced such inward grefe to his sorowefull sister together
with despair of any mean to restore him for that CAMILLA discontinued her
repair to vysitt her, that she yielded tribute to his passion with a disease of
equal mortality impartynge such alarams of dollor through all the parts of
her body that she was constrained to keep her bead in a little cabynett
ioyninge to the lodginge of LIVIO, who by the thinnes of the wall (which only
divided their chambers) was pertaker of the least word that was spoken in the
lodging of his sister, whose grievous groans forced by the violence of a
burning fever gave such increase to the danger of LIVIO, that he was at point
to yield to the last alaram of life, if the sickness of his sister had not
brought the spedye remedy of his disease, for CAMILLA, astonished without
measure that she neither met CORNELIA at the church, saw her at the gate
nor wyndowe nor any assemblye what soever, learned so much by inquisicion that
she was advertised of the mortal danger of LIVIO, together with thertremitye
of his sister, who (if they were not reskewed by great merueyle) were at
point to be shrined together at one instante in their fatal tomb. Here
CAMYLLA, began to recante her ancient creweltye, for in ceassynge any longer
to dissimule her secrett affection to her LIVIO, and the sorrow she suffered
for thaf^^iction of his sister, she seamed to purify the wrong she had
done to them both through a river of affected tears distillynge by such
abundance from her watery eyes, that she seamed at the point to visitt the
purgatory of the other woorlde, to do penance for the twoe euilles whereof she
confessed her self to be thonlye occasion, wherein after she had spente
certainne hours in public complainte, whose dollour seamed of force to move
the heavens to tears, and stay the course of the son fealynge still an
increase of passion by the vehemencye of love: she was constrained to abandon
the place, and perform the rest of her exclamacion against her cruelty all
alone in her chamber with this terms. What furye or force infernal is this
which shaking the fortress and most constante part in me has made me in
one moment, yield to that wherein I have been hitherto invincible? is it
possible alas, that, that which I judged a dissembled passion in this The
complaint of Camylla.
infortunat Gentleman should torn to a true effect of undoubted faith
confirmed by the power of that which we call love in the hearts of men? why
have not I considered, that the horse which is of noble courage willbe governed
by the shadow of a Rod, where the dull beast is skarcely sturred with the
princkyng of the spurs, the fearful dog does also bark more then bite,
and depest rivers do run with least noise, so nature has imparted a
peculiar instinct to the noble mind not only to be more delicate in diet, and
ardante in affection, but also to embrase the obiecte of their fancy with a
more vehemency of desite and passion, then the rest of the rude and gross
sort, who are not worthy to be partakers of the mysteries in true love: Ah
LIVIO LIVIO how do I feel a mocion of that which I can not term other
ways, then a free force without constrainte, and a dollour without cause of
complainte? for I am possessed with an evil wherein I take pleasure; and feels
an experience of a pain without the which I think the life of man can hardely
be sustained, and yet my mind wauereth in such dredefull conceits, that I
fear to make declaracion of that which both law of love and duty of my
conscience binds me to expose for the solace and relyefe of thy present
affliction? but alas the renoume of mine honest name is so dear unto me that
I wyshe rather to embrase the extreme panges of death, then give one simple
occasion of discredit to mine ancient virtue, for that as man's wisdom is
hable to supply ye losses of all other things so it is not only unfurnished
of means to restore the forfait of our honestye, but also void of art to
cover the falte of so great an offense, but is it a just imputation or
worthy falte, when in our busynes we respect virtue, and concludes the end
of our enterprise with an honest meaning? is it not a deed of compassion to
give soccours to him that stands in watter up to the throat, and at the
point to peryshe for want of help, what can we do lesses then be careful to
recover him who offers his life in the sacrefise of affection for our sakes?
who can justly term our doings by the title of offense, when we yield a
mutual amitye to him that pursues our goodwill with a respect and intent of
lawful marriage, no, no, CORNELIA thowe shalt not lose thy brother, nor I the
company of so dear a friend for lack to answer in reciprocal will to him
who with the peril of his life co^ceiles the argument of his sorrow, Ah most
constant and loyal LYVIO, seeing the reputacion of mine honor denies me
accesses and conference with the, and ye shame does close my mouth from
discovering the secret of my good meaning toward ye, take courage, and
discharg thou thoffice of a bold soliciter to her that is no less ready to
grant, then thou meritorious to have, and dispoiled already of all hagarde
cruelty, is not only pressed to reknowledge the honor which thou offreste me,
but also whollye framed to the POSTEY and appetit of thy will, and now do I
feel, that against the force and power of love, the strongest resistaunce is
to weak, neither is the whole world of sufficient strength to put to
vtteraunce the soldiers whom he prefers in the feylde, whereof who is a
more late experience then my self, who earste defyinge his malice, am now to
attend upon the chariott of his triumph and yield me prisonner to him, who
being hither unto my bondsman, has now made me the slave of his importunat
requests. And seeing the sentence is alredye paste, and confirmed by the voice
of my destymes, why do I conceile my passion in the myddest of a thousand
flames which torments me within, or why do I dissemble that, I desire most,
or retire mine eyes from the view wherein they chieflye delight? why do my feet
stay to transporte this body to the place, where the heart has already taken
possession, wherewith she determined the spedye consolation of LYVIO, with no
other drogue or confection, then a free consent of her love, if the same were
eftesoones demanded, and there upon collored her going to his logynge to see
CORNELIA, whom as she found in her bed with more arguments of death
then appearance of life, by reason of a generalle weakness which had
mortyfyed the whole strength of her body, so she had not spent in any words
in the consolation of her companion, but LIVIO (smelling as it were) the
presence of his lady asked his sister who was with her, who answered that
only CAMYLLA kept her company, wherewith forcing a supply of courage in his
fainte heart, with intent to know the fynall areste of his life or death,
began to plede with his absent mistres in this sort. If there be any hope in
extremetye, or expectacion of help in mortal distress, it is time now (good
Liuio at the poi^t of death speaks to his misters.

to defend your self from thymputacion of a tyrant, and my life from a wretched

indiffrent power to releue my distress either by death in denieng me your
favor, or contynuance of longer life by impartyng your specialle grace: come
cruel misters and see thy unfortunate LIVIO without heart, hope, or argument of
longer breathe, if by a promise of thy good will, thou breathe not an air of
fresh consolacion and by the sommaunce of thy word revoke my dyeng mind from
this tomb of miserable despair where in I feel my self so tormented with
thofficers of death, that nature ceassyng to supply my weary parts with
force, I find an impossibility in my tongue to obey any longer the desyers of
my heart, wherewith his breath began to draw short staying the course of
further speech, if not that in entryng into his fatal trance he exposed
certain doleful groans, which caused both the young Ladies to Run in
haste to the succor of the patient, whom they found stryuinge with
thextremetie of his last pange, albeit not without some little perye of
breathe, which he seamed to reserve with great difficulty, whereupon
CAMYLLA seeing a prouffe of his constancy even to the last moment, and
having but one mean to releue his trance, made no conscience to let fall
her rosye and courrall lyppes upon the mortifyed mouth of her diynge LIVIO
who received such present consolacio^ by this offer of favor unlooked for,
that ye force of nature and vital strength ready to depart out of every vain
of his body retired to their ancient places, wherewith he using the benefytt
of his fortune, forgatt not to embrase his Lady, with an infinite of kysses,
whereof she restored him a double interest, albeit because he should make no
great proffytt of this soddayne courtesye, and to prevent with all a suspicion
of light behavior in her self, she used her accustumed wisdom, entering into
familiar conference in this sort. I hope SEIGNEVR LIVIO you will not convert
this compassion which I have used in the rappeale of your mortal farewell into
any synister opinion of the diminucion of thintegretie of CAMILLA who as long
as she lives will so stand upon the guard of her honor and honest renown,
that no degree shall have just cause to reprehende the least favor she
extendes to any man, in which conceyte, I am also content to impart a credyt
to your loyalty, perswadynge the same to be without fiction whereof I am no
less glade, then I hope the love which you bear me is chaste and of honest
intent, respectynge an end of sincerity, for if I saw any lykelyhodd to the
contrary and that a dyseordinat will did guide your desyer, and were the cause
of your passion, assure your self I would make less conscience to commit
me to the mercy of the most horrible tourmentes in the world, eye and peril
of present death, then to lease any part of that which makes me march
without blushynge amongst the beast of our country: in which respect with
full perswacion of a sincere simplicity in your love, I can not but return
you a semblable favor, with absolute assurance from this instaunte of such
firm affection and zeal as any lady ought to impart to him who seeks her
frendshyppe in sort of honest and lawful marriage, neither shall yt dekaye
after theffect of desyer be parformed nor dymynishe by any synister accident
until the fatal sequestracion of our soul and body, whereof let us use
wisdom in the conueyghe of such affairs as may be taken both in good and
evil part, to the end that the majesty of the highest being not offended, our
honor fall not into the slander of the world wherein for a first charge to
be committed to your diligence, and with all to prefer an assured effect of the
vehemency of your affection toward me, dispose your self to demand me of
my Father whose consent you shall find me to confirm in such sort as your
self shall devise. Arm your self then with compfort and retire to health, at
the request of her, who taking no pleasure in solitary regardes, wishes you
to reserve this precious flower of your youth for other exercises, then to wast
with passions of desperacion no less enemies to the strenghte of the body,
then hurtefull to the health of the soul, and seeing besides, that in the
recovery of you, consistes the health of your sister suspende no longer the
consolacion of her and contentement of your self and me, who in attendynge
your expedicion to procure the goodwill of my father, will dispose my self in
the mean while to be thankful unto you any way wherein mine honor and
honestye will justify my doing: which last words seamed of such operation
in the traunsed mind of LIVIO, that discharged (as it were) of a perilous
vision in a dream lyfted up his eyes and hands toward heaven, yeldyng
honor to the gods for his happy encounter, and kissing the white and
delycate hand of his new mystresse, he forgatt not to give her such humble
thanks as the greatenes of his felicity required, which seamyng to him to
excede the compass and power of fortune, judged it rather the virtue of a
dyuyne miracle then an effect mortal, for that in so soddayne amoment he was
acquitted of so perentory a danger, assuring her that as soon as health and
strength of body would assyste the desyer of his mind, he would perform her
commandment in demanding her fathers consent, wherein he hoped to delay no
long time, for that he felt a wonderful approach of health by the view of her
presence in his late and last storm of affliction I would do no less (says
she) then yield you soccours in so great an extremity both to deliver my self
out of pain in saying you passioned, and also to qualifye the greffe of my
dear companion your sister, to whom you are also bound in some sort to be
thankeful for my coming hither: For albeit my conscience sommoned me to a
compassion of your torment with desire to yield you the due hyer and
consideracio^ of the honest love you bear me, yet ye regard of mine honor
deniynge me to visit you, seamed an impediment to theffect of that, whereunto I
was bound by so many duetifull merits, prayinge you for end to excuse that
which is past, and pardon me for the present, in that I can not assiste you
with longer company, persuadyng thy self (my dear LYVIO) that although my
body must supplye an other place to coullour the trafficque of our love, and
prevent suspicion, yet thou hasts made such a stealth of my heart that the same
will not fail to keep the company in my absence: wherewith taking her leave
with a chaste kiss, of her servant, and frendlye farewell to CORNELIA, she
retireth to her fathers Palais leaving her lover well lightened of all his
cares, saving of a necessary mean to sound the good will of the old
REINALDO wherein notwithstanding he used such expedicion of diligence, that
before himself could enjoy the benefyt of perfect health, he procured certain
ancient Ge^tlemen his near parents to perform his reqneste to thold nia^,
whom they solicited with such instance and in sort of marriage, that he
admitted their offer, and confirmed the bargain with these words, that only
LIVIO should be the first that should renounce the bale, albeit says he
because of thinfirmitie of mine age, I use the consent of my son in all my
affairs of importance, so I crave only your patience in the fynall conclusion
of the marriage til his return from Rome, at which time only your selves shall
name the day of consommation: in this answer albeit appeared an impediment to
the performance of the marriage, for that (as you have hard) CLAVDIO enuyed the
state of LIVIO, which argued a difficulty in him to approve shallyance, yet
CAMILLA understanding the resolution of both their parents, gave as sewer
judgment of the marriage, as if it had been alredie published in the church,
and thereupon began to enlarge her familiar hawnte and repairs to LIVIO whom if
she embrased before with earneste zeal, it was nothing in respectt of the
vehemency of her present affection, which also divided himself into such a
SYMPATHIA and equality of love in them both, that it spredde abroad by
indiffrent branches in both their hearts, like as the morninge son in the
east gives by little and little contynuall increase to his beams comforting
the creatures upon earth. And in this often enterviewe together, LYVIO,
enioyenge now his ancient health and dexterytie of body, being one day
(amongst the rest) with his lady in the cham ber of his sister took his lute
and song a ditie which he had made of their reciprocal passion, with such
contentemente to his CAMILLA, that she desired him eftesones to repaite it in
semblable note, as well for the delight of the tune, which he performed with a
voice to her contentacion, as also the subtle style and fine conueighe of the
matter, arguinge a conclucion of that which they both wished with equal
appitit, saying that as their continual haunt and frequentacion together, gave
increase to their desyer, so they were both of opynion, that love cold not
bear the title of perfect affection, if theffect of that which was
indiffrently wished of them both, did not make perfect the thing which
hitherunto was debated but by words, other ways that which was passed
between them, being but a naked love whithout effect, other then certain
delicate kysses which served rather to kyndle the coals of desyer, then
quench the flame alredye burning within their intralls seamed but a simple
platte or plain table, which the conninge painter has smothed for the nonst
to draw some image of exquisytt skille, wherein being ouercharged with
intolleracion of desyer, and fynding thabode of CLAVDIO longer then they
ymagined, they passed unhappily a pryuye contracte between shem selves, with
erspectacio^ to consomat the full of ye matter with a due hyer of ye pains they
endured indiffrently in attendinge, an effect of their pleasure at the return
of CLAVDIO from Rome. But here fortune began to present her self upon the
stage, as one that will be known to bear a swaighe in the good hap or
infelicitie of man, and us of such inconstant and malicious regard toward
us, that when we think we be paste the fear of all peril, and trodden all
desasters under our feet, it is then that we find least assurance in the
things wherein we reapposed our chiefest pleasure, and in the turninge of her
weal is figured the alte racion of our wordlie affairs. I mean by a
conversion of things which earste seamed pleasant and delicat, into a taste
ercedinge the bitterness of gal, in such sort, that often times we find
death of more easy burden then we are hable to bear the panges which
ordenarilye attend the flatteries of this uncertain FORTUNE, whom the Poets
and painters (not without cause have drawn in ye picture of a blind woman
standing upon a tickle stay of an unconstant globe or bowl representinge
thereby her fragilitie, and how blind lie she guides the things of ye world,
what authorities cold and infer to exclaim against her mobylitie, if it were
not for the shortness of time and that I will not cloye your memory, with so
tedious a discourse how many have we feene at the point to enjoy a
monarkye, kingdom or siegneury, who when they least thought of commutacion or
change, have lost their honor, expulsed their estates, and at last ended
their lives by a miserable death. Who have read the sixte. book of VALERIVS
MAXIMUS may iustefye my opynion by thexample of QVINTVS SCIPIO a valiant
capteyne and consul in Rome, who, long time having fortune at commandment
Quintus Scipio
was seen in a moment cut in morselles seruinge as unworthy food to the
rauenouse beasts issuinge out of the savage deserts RADAGASO sometime king of
the GOTHS for all thassuerance he reapposed in his invincible army (as he
thought) was not expempted from the dome of inconstante and mortal destynie,
for that his people slain, his capteines fled, and he taken prisoner, passed
under the sentence of an infamous death by STILICON general of tharmye at
that time for themprour HONORIVS, with other infynit proffes of antiquity,
wherewith it is no need to fill my paper, saying the domestical accedentes and
like chances happeninge amongst our neighbors at hoame, do give sufficient
testymonye and faith of that which we go about to prove. And now being
upon the discourse of LIVIO and his unfortunate CAMILLA, who albeit were ney
there princes nor governors of kingdoms, yet being in the paradise of their
pleasure and at the point to perform the last act of their delytes,
encountered in one moment a chang and synister subuercion all contrary to the
appointmente which they had resolved upon their future marriage, And sewer it
is an argument of the greatest folly that can be to promise our selves an
assurance of things which depend upon the will and dispocition of an other,
upon which the issue is also most uncertain, for that differing from us in
coun cell and ymaginacion, they are also without care in what sort we take
their judgment, saying they depend no way upon us nor our fancy: like as it
happened to these.ii. infortunat lovers for CLAVDIO now returned, and not
likinge any way thallyance between LYVYO and sister wrought so much with his
father (who saw not but by the eyes of his son, nor attempted any thing
wherinto CLAVDIO added not the conclusion that REINALDO renounced the words of
his former consent pacifyenge the parents of LIVIO, by the best parswacions he
cold ymagyn, with thanks to the young man equal to the greatness of the honor
whtche he offered in seking to be his son in law These news were no sooner
ymparted to our ii. lovers, but it is to be thought they escaped not without
sondrye alarams of mortal grefe, which had dismissed their passions with the
end of their lines; if it had not been for the offer of a simple hope whereupon
they grounded a new consolacio^ for yt they exspected at length a remorce in
tholde man (by reason of his promise) to iustefye the contract already passed
between them two, whereof CAMILLA as pinched with a grudge of more wrong then
the other, for that she saw the unjust malice of her brother was thonly stay
of theffecte of her determynacion entered into a passion of such frettinge
conceits tempered with a mortal hate to CLAVDIO, an indissoluble zeal to her
seruante, and a just dispite against the debylitie of her father, that she was
at the point to use force against her self, and advance theffect if their
malice by her untimely death, wherein because she would not discover openly,
that which was not yet douted of any, she retired to a moderation in her
grief till the first part of the eueninge being spent, the desire of sleep
somoned every man to wythdraw himself to his lodginge when she in her chamber
with thonly company of her woman began to burst out into new terms of
complainte cursing the hour of her birthe, accusinge the weakness and want of
courage in her father, but chiefly enueihed against thunhappie arryuall of her
brother in this sort. What injustice The complainte of Camilla.
or cruelty is this of the heavens to give us a heart to choose and liberty to
love one of equal desyer and semblable will and then to bar us the privilege
of that fredom in not making a perfection of that which nature has set
abroche in us by the communyon and conjunction of our thoughts? is it reason
the body be more respected then the mind, in that the heart and inward
parts making a choice of affection should not have authorytie to sommon the
body as their subject to obey thinstinctes and suggestions of the spirit,
nature sewer does abuse her reputacion in this case to coyfe her creatures with
thattyre of love, making a mutual consent in both parties and then to deny
the consommacion of the thing her self did first begin in us? from whence
comes thiniquitie of that law which allows a father for his pleasure only
and with out justice to force an inclynacion of his children to that which is
neither necessary nor conueniente for them? is it not sufficient alas that we
yield them honor, with the tribute of our duty and service, that we give
soccour to their old years, and attempt nothing without their consent, but
that we must be subject to a further tyranny in performinge the sentence of
their thraldom although it dyffer whallye from our will and choice? And if
marriage be a free conjunction, dependinge upon an unity or conformetie of
both parts, how can I refuce that whereof is passed alredye a confirmacion, or
admit other husband the^ he to whom I ham bound by vow of consent. A H this
is one of the fruits of tyrannouse love, to work the effect of a consent
between us, without leauinge us a mean to bring the same to perfection, or
suffer us to consider whether the parties knitt together by unity of affection
in spirit, might also be assisted with a conjunction of the bodies without
offense to god or the world, but what? why do I enter into terms of justice
with him, who is no way partaker of reason, and who is so soddaine and
uncertain in his Love is naked and with out eyes
enterprises, that he neither takes advise before he strike, nor uses leisure
to delyberat or foresee the success of any thing he begins, for as he is
naked and without eyes, so is he boyde of judgment, and inconstant in all
his doings, assailinge commonly the hearts of such as he fyndes idle and
least occupied with virtue: Ah spiteful disdain of kynred, and unnatural
malice of a brother, in what sort have I deserved this hard penance at thy
hand, to depryue me of the thing wherein I took most pleasure, wherein has
the curteyse LIVIO, offended the, if not that his honesty excedes thy rude
disposition, and virtue gives cause of shame to thy wicked will, or
paraduenture thou disdainest his just merit, for that he is better favored in all companies then thy self? And is it reason that thy consent confirm my
affection? why should my advancement depend upon thy good will, or the choice
of my husband ask council of thy consent? shall I be subject to him who
has no authority over me, but by an encrochement of years, for that he is
the eldest son of my father? has he any pryuiledge that way, to govern my
will, or give laws to my fancy, nothing less, for my father has already
paste thaccorde between LIVIO and me but you will say paraduenture under a
condition, a simple article I confess, which also is of no force, if the
party be void of pretense of prejudice? And wherein shall it be either
prejudicial or proffitable to him, if LIVIO be my husband? saying it
belongs to my father to depart with my dowery and portion of marriage, and my
husband to dispose it without interuption so long as he is a member of life,
what weakness is this in a father to be governed whollye by the breath of his
son, whose unjust malice rather then argument of reason makes him renownce the
word of his honor in a case touching the quiett and consolation of her, who
ought to be no less dear unto him, then her tyrannouse brother, who when he
has exposed the vttermoste effect of his spite, and that I am to be bestowed
in an other place by his appointment, it shall appear whether his
commandment be as currante over me then, as his malice rages without
measure or reason at this present, protestinge by the height of the heavens,
that none other then he to whom I have pawned my faieth shall enjoy the
chaste acquaintance of thinfortunat CAMILLA: no LIVIO is mine, what wrong
soever they do to our vertuese love, which so long as I live shall be in
dyssoluble in me, being ready withal to refuce no thing that may advance
the consommacion of the marriage between me and him without whom I feel an
ympossibilytie to live: wherewith her passion grew to such a vehemency, that
her last words ended with the course of longer breathe, in such sort that
she slyded soddainly from the seat where she sat, and fell grouelinge upon
the ground, resigning with a dollorous skryke the use of vital air, albeit
the expedition of diligence in her woman procured with much ado a return of
life, and with such consolacion and offer of hope as she cold prefer, she
won her to go to bed, where albeit the view of the wrong and discurtesye of
her brother seamed for a time to stay the course of sleep, yet in the often
repeticion of her sorrows appeared a little of qui ette, which closed her eyes
and cast her into a slomber where in she seamed to behold standing before her
thymage of her LIVIO half dead embrasing her with a pale and hydeous regard,
which forced her to such a fear, that she brake soddainely out of her
dredefull sleep, spendinge the rest of the wearye night in pytifull
complaints, wherein certainly she had raison, for that in that dream or rather
mystical vision, was fygured the desaster which not long after overwhelmed
them both, neither ought we to find it strange if thapprehensions appearing
in our sleep, do give us warninge, of the good or evil happeninge unto us, for
that we have certain records which iustefye the same in the person of one
BRUTUS he which was vanquished in the feldes of PHARSALEMO whether he were
awake, or in the depthe Brutus warned of his overthrow in his sleep.
of his sleep, seamed to see in his tente a terrible shappe of a certain
sprite pronouncinge his overthrow, besides thaushorytie of natural reason
mouethe us to confess, that as the ympression of a great fear, or longinge
desyer of any thing do present often times affore the eyes of our mind (the
body being in rest) the image of that which we love or fear. So also the
sprit that is void of passion, or at point to fall into some perilous
accident, encountreth commonly in his sleep the thing which he wishes not to
happen, and abhors to remember when his eyes have dismissed the drowsy humor
of sleep, for CAMILLA desiered nothing less then the death of her LYVIO, and
yet not long after the pre sage or forewarninge of her dreadefull vysion she
only witnessed the effect assistinge his funeral with her presence in the
tomb, as well as she was willing to admit his company in the secret bed of
their infortunat marriage. LIVIO for his part was not void of passion on the
behalf of the froward success of his busynes albeit seeing he cold no way
bribe the goodwill of fortune, he resolved to give place to her present
malice, and in attending the benefytt of a better time, to practice CLAVDIO by
circumstance and mediacion of his near friends, Albeit felinge in the mean
while an intolleracion of love, with contynnall increase of desire to coll the
flower of his affection and taste of the pleasant Iewyste of the grape which
quenches the thirste of the loyal lover, he ymparted his pain and request to
his Lady in a letter of this substance. Saying there is no justice good lady
to supporte the consent to your own disquiet, and Lyuyo vvriteth to C^mil l^.
suffer me to live in passion without comparaison, methinke you do wrong to
thindiffrent contentment of us both? for if you desyer my death you need use no
other minister for fatal execution then the alarams of dollor which I
encounter daily by your means, but if you have care of my quiett, and grieve no
less with thimposicion of my mortal torment why make you such conscience to
yield me consideration of the honest zeal I bear you seeing the same does
also ymporte a special contentment to your self, you know what is alredie
passed between us, neither are you ignorante of the small respect your parents
use toward you, wherwyth if the mutual consent conclude the marriage, you
ought also to understand, that neither the tyranny of the one nor want of
courage in the other, has power to wythholde you from that which you are bound
to perform, nor hinder me to enjoy the benefyt of my desert, wherein I appeal
to the tooch of your consience, with request to consider in what sort you will
advise, me to the end that by thassistance of your council, I may the better
carye over the greatness of my extremetie, which as it is divided into spedie
relief or present despair, so saying I am of force to pass by the one I
doubt of which of the two to make my most proffyt, for albeit the first has
power to perform the full of my felycity yet in attendinge theffect, I consume
in a flame of burning desyer, and the other, if it ymporte a present
abridgmente of my tormente by untimely death, yet in the very act consistes
a spot of dishonor to my self, and an everlasting surname of cruelty to her
in whose balance waigheth thindyffrent sentence of the life or death of the
most desolate and LOIALL LIVIO.

CAMILLA which desired nothing less then to delay the desire of her servant,
for that her self labored of the same disease, returned ye messengier with no
other answer, the^ that at after dinner she would vysitt CORNELIA, when also
she would satisfy his master by mouth, for yt she feared ye subteltie of her
brother would intercepte her letters where with thinfortunat LIVIO, not knowing
the thread of mischief which fortune was now spynnynge for him, entered into
such solace that the chamber wherein he walked seamed to little to contain bys
present gladness, the rather for that he ymagined yt his mistress would now
dismysse all excuses and impedimentes to theffect of his long desyer, seeing
there wanted nothing to consommate the marriage, but solemn publicacion, in
which passion of joy he supplied the time in attendynge the coming of his
Lady with singynge and soft music, according to the nature of the Swan, who
the nearer The property of the svvan being near her death.
she draws to the end of her destiny, the pleasanter note she synges,
bathinge and pruninge her self in the purest stream she can find, to the end
to do honor to her funeral ^ate: and as he ymagined thus to be at the point to
arrive in the subburb of his paradise, behold the approach of ye goddess of his
devotion and dear mistres CAMILLA with her Chambriere, who as she was alredye
priuye to the whole practice: So she used her company now to avoid
suspicion, imparting the same to LIVIO, to the end he need not distruste her
presence, if by chance they entered into parley touching any secret match
where neded not thassistance of many witnesses.

And being thus in arms together, God knows if any sort of kysses or other
follies in love were forgotten, wherein as it is a common experience, that
neither bytt nor bridle is hable to govern the furye of love, when we be at
point to enjoy the pleasures we desyer, so there appeared such an indifferent
vehemency of appetit between their, that at thinstant they made a plat or
beginning of that which the same evening gave end to the pleasure and life
of them both, wehrof CAMILLA as more hoate in desyer, or less hable to bear
the burden of her burning affection, prevented the request of LYVIO and made
plain the first entrey and path to both their mishappes, saying that forasmuch
as our consentes have concluded a marriage, and that in the breach of our
promise appears a perentory prejudice to our consciences, that we seal
tharticles of the contract, with a full consommation of the secret ceremonies in
marriage, both to take away all occasion of offense, and also to mortifye the
malice of my brother (maugre his heart) wherein says she being fully persuaded
of your consent to my proposition, and for that in cases of love delays and
long consultation Delays be hurtefull in cases of love
be hurtefull, and st^rre up causes of displeasure to the hearts of such as
be stricken with the same disease, whereof the contrary, the rest of our
human affairs require a maturitie of council, to the end the success may
answer therspectation of the parties, so I wish you to attend the benefyt
of time this evening, I mean at the hour of supper, when men are given least
to suspicion, you fail not to come in as secret manner as you can to the
gardeine gate, where my woman shall be ready to conueig^e you into my chamber, to
the end we may there take advise of that which we have to do, whereunto LIVIO
was not curious in consent, and less vnmindeful to yield her the choice of a
thousand thanks for offringe the privilege which he doubted to demand,
giuyng her assurance to use such exact wisdom in the conueyghe of so secret
a mystery, that ARGVS himself, if he were upon earth should not descrye his
coming, and much less any be pryuye to the dance, but such as performed the
round, wherein he was not deceived, for as he was the first, so she failed
him not at the cloase, and both their miseries of equal quality in the end,
like as it happenethe often times that those amarous bargains redoundes to the
harms of such, as be the parties, who albeit do allege a certain respect
of honesty in their doings, by pretense of marriage, yet God being the judge
of their offense, will not suffer the wrong to the obedience of their parents
in concludyng priuye contractes unpunished, and that with such a penance, as
the remembrance is notorious in all ages. But now to our LIVIO who neither
vnmindeful of the hour, and less forgetful to keep appointement, attyreth
himself for the purpose in a night gown girt to him, with a pair of shoes
of felt, least the noise of his feet should discover his goinge, and for a
more honor of his mistres, he forgot not his perfumed shyrte, spidered with
curious branches according the fancy of his Lady, with his wrought coyffe
poudred with diverse drogues of delicat smell, wherewith he steals in as
secret manner as he can to the gate of appointement, where he found the guide
of his love, whom he embrased as well for the service he found in her, as
also in that she resembled the beautye of his mistres CAMYLLA, who after she
had taken her nights leave of her father and brother, with search that every
man was in his place of rest, retireth to her chamber with such deuocio^ as
commonly they yt find themselves in semblable iorneye to work theffect of
such like desir, where encountering her infortunat servant, it was concluded to
imploye no time in vain reverence, or idle ceremonies, but in a moment they
entered their fatal bed together, where after certain amarous threats, and
other folyes in love (seruyng as a preamble to the part they meant to play)
LIVIO entered into the unhappy pageant of his fatal and last pleasure, wherein
he chaffed himself so in his harness, and was so greedy to cooll the first
flower of the virginity of his CAMILLA, that whether the passion of joy,
preuailynge above ye force of the heart, and thinner parts smothered with
heat, could not assiste thenterprise according to their office, or that he
exceded nature in surfettinge upon his pleasant banquet, he found himself so
sharplye assailed with shortness of breath, that his vital forces began to
fail him in the midst of the combat, like as not long since it happened to
ATTAL US the cruel king of the HVNES, who in ye first night of his infortunat
marriage in HVNGARYE The king of the hunes died in the excess of pleasure
with his wife the first night of their marriage.
enforced himself to so great a courage in the pleasant encounter with his
new wife, that his dead body (found in her arms the next morning)
witnessed his excess and glottenouse appetit in the skirmyshe of love, which
also might be the bane of this LIVIO, who respectynge no measure in drinking
of the delicat wine, no more then if it had been but one banquet, dressed for
him in the whole course of his life, was so over charged with desire in that
pleasant skirmishe that the conduites of life stoppynge upon a soddaine,
barred to add fourther strength to his gredye appetyt, whereupon he became
without m ocion, or feelinge in the arms of CAMYLLA, who feelynge him Livyo
died of the like in the arms of his Camilla.
without sense and that he seamed more heavy and rude upon her then affore,
dowted a trothe, wherein also she was fully satisfied by the light of ye candle,
which she caused her chamberiere to bring to the bed side, where vewinge the
dead body of him whom she loved no less then her self, and iudgyng the cause
as yt was in deed, entered ymedyatly into such a mortal passion of dollour,
that albeyt she would have exposed some words of compassion on the behalf
of the pytefull accident, yet feelyng a general dymynucion of force through
all her parts by thynnundacion or waves of soddaine sorrow, she found her
tongue not hable to supplye the desyer of her heart, which with the consent of
the rest, loathynge the use of longer life, resigned her borrowed term to the
fates, falling at thynstant without sense or feelynge upon the dead body of
him whom she accounted a duty to accompany in the other world, as well as
she delyted in his presence during their mutual aboade in this miserable
valey. A happy kind of death if we had not to consider the peril which
attendes such wretches, as having no mean to perform theffect of their
pleasure, but by vnlafull stealthe, are so frank for the shortness of their
time that in satisfynge the glot of their gredye appetit they make no
conscience to sacrifise there own life: but if we pass furthe in the view of
these offenses, we shall find a derogacion of the honor and integretye of the
mind, with a manifest prejudice and hazard to the health of the soul,
which makes me of opinion, that yt is the most, miserable end that may
happen to manne, the rather for that the chyefest thing which is regarded in
the putsuet of that entreprise, is to obey the sommance of a bestely and
unbridled lust of the flesh, wherein I wyshe our frantike lovers, who
(making contemplacion upon causes of love) accomptes yt a virtue to end
their lives in this LASCIVIVS bond of pryuye contract, to refrain that which
is so indifferent hurtefull both to the soul and body, seeing their death is
not only without argument of desperation, but also their sowles most sewer
to receive the guerdon of cyuil morder, which we ought to fear and eschew
as near as we can before the sequestration of the earthelye substance, from
the part of divinity which we partycipat with God, and what contentement or
glory so ever they reappose in this monstrous abrydgement of nature,
reprehendynge them of destoyaltie which do the contrary, yet their act
merits none other name then the title of brutalitie, neither can I think but
their opynion is guided by some sprite or humor of frantyke follye, like as yt
is not the part of a Christian (as the Appostle affirms) to prefer the fyckle
pleasures of the flesh, which are of shorter moment, then the thoughts of a
man, before the fear of God, recke of our life, and care to present our sowles
with out spot, before the troane of mercy in the day of general account,
when all thoughts shall be deciphered and no falte unpunished: the poor girl
of the chamber to the dead CAMILLA, seeing this fatal misterye, with the
distress she was in, for that she was a companion of the conspiracye,
thinking to give end and play the last act of the tragedy, serched about
the chamber for some glaue or sword or other thing apt to make the minister
of her blody intent, and being deceived that way, she had no other mean to
play doble or quit but with impetuosity of dollor, wherein she raged with such
doleful skryches, that the brute of her complaint awaked the whole house,
whereof the first that entered the chamber of funeralles was the tyrant CLAVDIO
whoa albeyt was thenly cause of this dolorous massacre, yet in place of
confessyng his falte, or yelding sorrow to the loss of such ij. loiall lovers,
he grew in more rage by the view of the dead body of LIVIO, whereof as he
would willingly have committed a new morder, saving that he saw him without
respiration or argument of life, so his anger being turned into wodnes, and
rage into furye, he wreaked his collor upon the poor girl to whom he gave
iij. or iiij. estockados with his dagger through the body, and slonge
ymediatlye out of the chamber, to the great amaze and terror of his
unfortunate father, who seeing his house full of morders, and his son
committed oppen slaughter in the person of the innocent gyrle, could not so
govern his passion of dolor, but he seamed more ready to pass that way then
desirous to enjoy longer life, albeit being kept from doing force against
himself, by certain his servants that were there, he uttered sompart of his
inwaerde gref by open exclamation against his own misfortune, inveighynge
chyeflye against the inordin at will of his daughter, with advise to all
fathers to keep a steddye eye upon their slypprye y outhe, wherein he commended
unto them the example of his own follye in favoring so much the fond appetit
of his daughter that he gave leave to her Liberty to excede the view or
pursewte of his eye, accusynge chiefly the impedyment he gave to the marriage,
seeing that in the same appeared the perentory ruin of his house, continual
desolation to his old years, and in the end to leave his goods and living to
strangers for want of an heir of his body, for that having but ij. children
the one was already dead, and the other no less worth by ye mortal violence
he had used upon the innocence of the maid, who (after ye surgeants had
somewhat stayed ye bledyng of her wounds) confessed the contract and
circumstance of the love whereof you have hard a particular declaracion,
which rather increased the dule of tholde man, then gave moderation to his
sorrow, which notwithstanding by the perswacions of his neighbors, and
constraint of necessity (which as) a virtue gives patience perforce to all
extremeties he dysmissed in outeward show and disposed himself to the funeral
obsequies in as solemn manner as he cold, erectynge a tomb of marble in
Saint francys church, wherein were shryned the bodies of the ij lovers as dead
at one time, and by one occasion, to the great regreat of the whole town
wherein every one was so indifferentlye passioned with sorrow that a man
should hardly have hard any other tunes then public exclamacion against the
cruelty of CLAVDIO by which general complaint, together with the depositio^s
of the maid (who dyed within three days after her hurtes) DOM RAMYRO CATALANO
governor of CESENNA under CAESAR BORGIA, began to enter into terms of
compassion on the behalf of the ij. dead lovers, and mortal anger against
CLAVDIO, for that his cruelty only was the cause of the death of the ij. only
flowers and perago^s in Italy, wherein he purseued so vehemently ye rigor of
his office, and equity of justice yt CLAVDYO lost his head secretly within the
castle for fear of mutine or tumulte of his friends. This was ye miserable end
of ye love and lif of ye ij. SISENNOIS wose death and discorse of amarous
traffic, for yt it does not exced the remembrance of our time, I have
preseted as a familiar example affore ye eyes of our youth, to thend yt every
one respecting ye duty of his own endeavor, may use ye misery of this precede^t
as a pattern to prevent ye like myschief in the^ selves, wherein also as we may
note that love is but a rage or humor of fra^tike follye derived of our selves,
and converted to our own harm by thindiscrecion that is in us, so ye next
remedy to withstand that furye is to encounter him under thenseigne of raison,
and slay the occasions, which weaken the mind without travel and bring the
body in the end to the theatrye of execution, we are also warned here to
temper the delites we possess with such measure, that forgetting the
blyndenes of LIVIO, we may eschew the horror of his act with detestation of
the folys he used in the glott of his unlawful pleasure.

FINIS.
The argument,
ACcording to thoppinion of the wise Demosthenes there is no one virtue that
has made more famous the fathers of former time, then the gift of cyuill
curtesy, neither is nature more glorified in the ympes of her creation, then in
that we dispose our selves and doings according to the dispocition of the
clymat which she has appointed to govern our accions and thoughts,
respecting chiefly to refrain from violacion of innocent blodde, which in all
ages has restored a name of great clemency to diverse Albeit (touching other
effects) they were ambycius tyrants, and cruel enemies to their own common
wealth, which, unnatural cruelty also as it has been and is of such
detestacion amongst ye rudest companions of the world, that the very
barbarians have always had in horror the wickedness of such as pursewed the
queste of guiltles blodde, and took away the life of him that had not
committed offense, So they have always had in honor the virtue of such as
sought to extirppe the root of tyranical furies borne for the ruin and
destruction of man like as among the roman emprours Nero Calygulus and
Commodus, amongst ye straung nations, Phalaris Alexander Phereus Dyomedes and
the cursed Numylysyntha Queen of Thracia, who after she had miserably murdered
an ynnocent mother, committed semblable cruelty upon the child within her
bellye, whereof albeit the horror was great yet was it nothing in respect of
the hellishe act of a lady of our time happyninge not in the Antropophogans
Scythya or amongeste Canybales or Amazones aunciente morderers of their
children, but in the heart and midst of Evrope, and in one of the most fair
and rich provinces of the world, where before time has been kept all Academia
or general scoole to instruct all nations for the honest and virtuous
direction of their lives, but of late was found there a gentlewoman
(degeneratinge from thinstincte of her sect) which exposed effects of more
crueltye, then erst has been noted by any writers of a any age, whereof the
discourse folowethe at large.

whence distylleth all poysned humors of Infection, ouerflowinge at length the
channel of his quiett course with vnrewelye waves of Inordynat crewelty: I mean
here to present unto you the true pattorne of a second MEDEA, in the person
of a young Lady borne and wantonlye bredd up in the rich and populus City of
MYLLEYNE, whom because mine author seames to Christen by a contrary tytell, to
aboyde all occasions of myslykes which other Ladies (bearinge the like name)
might unjustly fall into by the lauishe mouths of the malycyous sort, I think
it good also to pass under fearmes of like scylence her parents and husband,
to the end that their virtue (meryting a better mede then to bear the blame of
the detestable life of there wicked daughter) come not also in question
amongst such DIABOLOS as have there tounges always typped with the metal of
malycyous slander. This PANDORA then (borowinge her name of the qualytye of
her unchaste and crewell conuersacyon) gave manifest signs during the time of
her Infansye of her future disposition, arguinge the poysined Clymatte which

without measure, honge altogether full of the feathers of folyshe pride, so
whollye given to wallowe in dilycarie that she detected al exercises of virtue,
and so drowned in the filthy desire of the flesh, that before she had
attained to the full of fortene years, she became such a banque roupte of her
honor that a poor page the son of a simple artyficer noryshed in the house
of her father for charity sake only, exept so far into her creditt, that
with small suit he gained the use of the I Will which ought to be Inuincyble in
dishonest sort, wherein notwithstanding after he had once rampyred himself,
fyndinge the soil in less fertyle, then to be tylled with easy travel, he
found also no less famylyarytie in the owner, who feasted him so frankly with
the pleasant Ieweste and precious commodity of her Island, not erst
inhabyted by Strangers, that his common exercise was to keep her company
every night alone in her chamber, least the LEVTYNS and dangerous bogbeares
appearinge by visions in the night should put her in fear or keep her from
sleep. This was one chief delyght wherein she took pleasure in the prime time
of her age, an undoubted calendar suer of the noble acts to be expected in
this ympe as her years grew to greater number, and her desire of more
maturytye, which wicked exercise is sufficyent of it self to untie the tunges
of bacbyters, styrringe up the malice of certain POLOLVGOS redye always upon
one simple occasion; or; for the falte of one, to reprehende the honor of all

their suborned reasons of reproach, but also by the clear Integrety of your
conversation, to charm the mouth of the slaunderer from Inueyghing by synister
means against any of the noble sect femenyne so much commendable and to
be honored of all men. This young pupil and prentyse of VENUS, although she
lystned with small traynynge to the lewre of CVPIDO, yet used she
notwithstanding such care in the conueyghe of her folyes, that the best eyes
in her fathers house, wear to blind to behold the amorous traffic which
passed between the page and her, neither was she doughted (wheresoever she
came) to be preferred to the first place in the bedroll of pewer virgins,
although (as you have hard) she had paid the first fruits of her virgynytie to
one no less unworthy of thoffering then to enjoy the possession of so dear a
Jewel, being already vowed to an other by the^ yt by most right ought to

not only make them bodies subject to all sensual prostytucyon, but also
subuertes the honor of their whole house whereof they took there beginning.
This ITALIAN Impe. and honest PANDORA, wearye even now of the company of her
page who belyke was not hable to quench the lust of his insatiable mystresse,
began with famylyer glaunces of her eye, and other secret regardes of good
will, to practyse a second league of society, concludinge a new bargayne of
love with a young gentylman lustye and likelye every way to perform
thexpectacion of her desire, who also for his first endeavor, found ye means to

Poets feign) that opned IVPITER the door of the brazen tower wherein ye fair
DANAE daughter of ACRISES was curyously enclosed. This second lover thinking to
cooll the first flower of the maydenhed of PANDORA (being yet scars xvi.
years of age) began to doubt of the case, when he found the way already
beaten and the entrye so easy without resistance, albeit contentinge himsefle
with his present fortune, being driven notwithstanding to drink the lees of
the vessel which the page had gaged to his hand, and sucked out the sugared
Iewse of ^f that grape, he failed not to court her with a contynuall ^^aunte
of his company, in such sort, that his chief exer^^ise and time was
employed in the supplye of her gredy de^yre, until at last being cloyed for
want of change of dy^^tte, or wearye with so long huntinge one kind of
chase, ^r peradventure not hable any longer to mainteyne the skir^ysh for want
of fresh supplies, he began to suborne diverse ^eanes to purchase his departure,
wherein with thassystance ^f a few feigned importunytyes, he prevailed only
with his exense: that being captain of certain bands of footmen, ^t behooved
him (he said) for great respects, to visitte his charge with expedicion,
wherewith, with small suit he gatte leave and went his way, resigning the
forte which he had so long battered, to the guard of an old and rich
gentylman, dwellinge in the same City, who doatinge more upon the beauty of
PANDORA, then notinge deligentlye her disposytion, married her, after long
intercession to her friends. A mache far unmeet considering thinequalitye of
their years, for he bearing the burden of syftye wynters upon his back, his
former moisture and strength converted into watrye humors of weakness, scars
hable to sustain nature, who at those years also sommons all men to declyne,
seamed far vn^able to encounter in singler combat with her, that had not yet
seen thuttermost day of eyghtene years, albeit being married, although his lot
was to take other men's leauings, yet he myslyked not his choice, but being
mounted upon a common hackney, he thought himself well horsed, and as one not
very scrupulous, or little skylled in such kind of housekeping, he took her
for a pure virgyn: a thing not much to be merueyled at, saying the daily
accedentes in the like affairs, and specially the subtle charms, and sundry
legerdemaynes, whereof such DERMOPTERAE or letherwynged huswyues as PANDORA have
no small store, to cover their saultes, and make them seem maydenlike
(althought they have already played the dydopper) that the clearest eyes had
need of spectacles, and the wiseste wits want sleyght to dyserne their
conning: and now this new married dame getting first the vpperhande of her
old husband, made her second endeuore to have the whole conueygh of all the
househoulde doings, whereby her commandment was only current, And she
houldinge the rain of her liberty in her own hand, might haunte and use
what place for recreacion she list at her pleasure, neither forgatt she so to
brydel goodman hornsbye (her husband) with obedience, that with out his
controlmente or suspicion, Monsieur le page, (who gave the first earnest penie
of her honesty) had free access unto her chamber, where he paid his own
arreareges, and also helped to supply the cold courage of the old knight, who
as he rather increased her appetyte, then satysfyed her desire, so his good will
peradventure was more the^ his power hable to perform. And as ye page had thus
eftsoon placed him self in ye possession of his former pray, it chanced that
a yo^g gentillman banished from Rome for certain forged conspiracies incensed
against him, fled to MYLLAN where lodging right over the pallais of Pandora,

be requited with ye like regards, and seeing her fair, young, and disposed The

regard of his countenance, painted full of arguments of dule, and after by
certenie secrett sighs, declaringe (after Thytalyan manner) the arde^t flame of
affection, not ceassinge continuallye to burn his heart in the desire of her
beauty, and omitting no mean which might move her to take compassion of his
pain, he forgot not to pass diverse times before her lodginge, with a lute or
other music of soft melody, whereunto also he accorded his phyled voice with
notes of pleasant twne, and that with such a grace of great delight) yt the
sweet noise of his hermony seamed a thousand times of more entysinge melodye,
then the heavenly Ionkinge of the Nytyngal, wherewith in short time he kyndled
a fire in the heart of this young wanton, toward whom h nedde not have used
such cyrcumstance or long ceremonye, saying that of her self (if his suit had
not Intercepted her) she had prevented his meaning, in taking upon her
thoffice of the clyent, being only given to raunge and rauyn for the
satysfyinge of her inordynat lust, desirous to change her acquaynted soil,

being from home) This romayn lover called CANDIDOIOCVNDO made his walk in
Solomne manner under her chamber wyndowe playing of his lute with a voice of
such masquid musycke myngled with outward shows of dolor in his face, and
poudred fynely with sundry syghes of pityful disposition, that it seamed of
such strange operacion in the heart of PANDORA, being already throughlye
daunted with the desire of him that sought but to desceyue her, that being
now no longer hable to keep her ears shutt from the voice of the crafty
charmer, desired him to enter, whereunto (as the subtle fouler pyping all the
day in the bottom of the hedge till he has allewred to his bushe the bird

PANDORA forgot not to feast him so frankly with shameful encounters on her
part, that with little suit, and less intreatye, he entered commons in the
place, which the old John thought to be reserved several to himself, and
with small conynge gave her checkmate, that stood slenderlye upon her guarde,
lothinge even now her incontynencie that so easelye yielded her honesty in

order of matrimonye, and if their desteny be incide^t to so evil a fortune, as
to enter into societic with a secret friend besides their husband (a thing
notwithstanding forbidden by the word of God) and less tolerable by the
passytiue laws of the world) yet ought they (I say) be so confirmed in their
unlawful affection toward their second pewmate, that their amitye may seame
of perpetuitye, and without change, neither ought they be so careless in the
choice of their extraordinary consort, as their own doings afterward may make
the^ worthily to be laughed at, which in deed is ye just reward for such as
seem so ligt of their seal, that they short of without either mache, slint, or

example is to be noted in the sequel of this Pandora, who was not only in
short time utterly detested of yt ROMAIN, but also a commeniestinge stock and
pointed at (by his means) of al men for her rash familiaritye used toward
him, who not long after the first foundation, of this friendship was called home
from exile by Leo de Medicis, their sovereign vycar of the Sea of Rome,
perdonyng his offense, and restoryng the use of his former lybertye, at whose
departure (unlooked for) Pandora entered into no small passion of dolor, not for
any seruent affection or love which she bare to her Romain friend, but because
his sudden goinge away, left her void of all lycours to quench the
burning flame of the gredy goote of her unnatural concupiscens, and chiefly
because Monsieurle Page began also to ware cold in the combat which he had
wont to maintain with such courage. But fortune here was so frendlye to the
fulfyllynge of her licencious appetit, that she (styring up a fresh supply of
her desire presented in the listes a young knight of Myllan called Caesar
Parthonope, who by chance hyrynge the lodging of the late Romain succeeded him
also in desire and diligence, for he at the first vewe regarding the
flateringe beautye of this ALCYNE his neighbor, suffered himself unadvisedly
to flyppe into the snares of love, honoryng that in his heart with Her bevvtie.
true sincerity as a dear Jewel, which his predecessor worthily hated with
dew detestacion. And entering here into the pagant of love, his first part was
to give some outward arguments of his inward affection, wherein he began to make
many pale walks before her gate, rouynge with his eyes at her chamber wyndowes
(according to the amorous order of the vain Spanyard) vtterynge by the
doleful vewe of his troubled countenance, the great and secret desire
quarelynge inwardlye with his unruly thoughts. But what need a man use polycie
where slender suit will prevail, or who will bend his battery to that
fortress, whereof the captain demaundes partly, and sues for composition. And
besides when the veil of shame is once removed from our eyes, what let is
there to stay the sensual course of our bestly appetits. And they that suffer
the rain of reason to slack or wholly to slip out of their hands, semes as
tra^sformed in a moment, and so weakened touching the lively mocions and forces
of the spirit, yt the exterior prouocacions and appetit of desire prevail
wholly above the inward resistance and accions of the soul, like as this
glotton and impudent Pandora, who seeing her sometimes saluted with a pleasant
eye of her new neighbor, forgot not to requit him with such wanton glaunces
and of such open understanding, that the knight doubting not of the success
of his interprise, assured himself already of the victory, wherein he was
somewhat helped by the hand of fortune, who providing a journey for the husband
of Pandora touching therecution of a commission in a foreign country, kept him
absent in those affairs, the space of a year or more, wherein Parthonope
forgot not to use thoportunitye of so convenient a time, and being ignorant
with all of the great liberty of his mistres, who drew him on all this while by
fine trains, to thend to make him more eager of bit, had no way to unfold ye
cause of his passion but by a letter, which he made the messenger of his grefe,
and soliciter of his desire in this sort.

The curious Artificer and coninge work woman Dame Nature, Parthonope
vvritteth to Pandora.
I see well (good madame) was not so careful to work you in her semelie frame
of all perfections, as the powers divine and difposers of the dangerous and
loftye planets, (assisting her endeavor with certain peculier ornaments of
their special grace) wear redye to open their golden vessel of precious
treasur pouring by great abu^da^ce their heavenly gifts upon you, striving (as
it semes which of the^ for thencrease of his glory should dispose himself most
liberaliy on your behalf, like as (according to the Poets) they contended of
old for the adoring by several ornaments the late Pandora, whom for all
respects they agreed to be the odd image of the world, but specially for
beauty, which if it dazeled ye eyes of the gods, shining as a twinkling starr
in theleme^ts above, yours I think was reserved as a torch of glistring flame
to give light to ye creatures of the midel world, whereof (for my part) vewing
with to ardent affection ye sundry celestial ornaments imparted to you by the
Gods, wc the percinge beams of rare beauty given you for your dowry of
Nature, I doubt whether mine eyes (du^med altogether with admiracio^) will first
cry out for ye loss of their former sight, or my whole body (plunged in the
passion of affection) will accuse the heart with the rest of thinward senses
consentinge so easily to the cause of their disquiet, wherein my life wayeth
indiferentlye in the balance of a thousand annoyes, and mine ancient liberty
in the mean while kept close in an extreme captiuitye. Albeit measuring your
heauely shape with thutwarde show of singular curtesye, that semes to occupye
al your parts, I can not resolve of any cruelty to consiste in you, neither
can I judge by the argument of your beauty) but yt my captivity shall be
spedely ca^uerted a happy delivery, like as also my hope half assures me
triumphinge with honor over the doubtful object of my thought, to taste at your
hands of the pleasant fruits of the thing I chiefly desire, which is (in
accepting me for your servant and secret friend) to admit me into such place of
pitye, as the dew merit of my unfeigned service deserves by Justice, wherein
your act shall seem no less meritorious before the throne of the high goddess;
then honorable with general fame for ever in the world, for releuynge him,
who without your assistance, (being wholly transformed to thappetite of your
will) fyndes the burden of life of such uneasy tolleracio^, that ye least
repulse of his suit at your hands, iports his fatal summonce, to resign the
term of his borrowed ye res in this world. Neither does he desire to have the
fruicion of his earthly days any longer, then to imploye the same withal
humility in the service of you, whom his heart has already pronounced the
souerein Lady of his life, whereof, you only may dispose at your pleasure.

preferred vedement importunities, she winge the boy which way he should
bring him to her chamber, where says she I will attend his coming this

his embassage to ye dolorous knight, who revived by the gladsome news of his
boy, but chieflye by the short appointment resolved upon by his mistress,
cast of at thinstant thapparell of dule, disposinge himself every way to
perform thexspectation of the charge committed unto him by the mouth of her,
whose commandment he would not transgress, though his life should incur
the hazard of a thousand perilles, and putting himself in as seamelye order as
he thought good, went (only with his page in solemn manner to visit the saint,
who was of her self more redye to grant freelye, then the pilgrim to demand
by petition, and who attending his coming, with more desire to ease the
passion of the patient, in quenching the fervent rage of her insatiable
appetit, then he for his part had cause to yield adoration to so detestable a
shryne, was withdrawn all alone into her chamber where he found her coyfed for
the nonst only in a night gown and attire for the night ready to go to bed,
which with the natural show of her liuelye beautye, set out to the most
advantage by the shining light of the wax candels, drove the knight at the
first into such astonishment, that the use of his spech was converted into
scilence, and his eyes only occupied in beholding the rare beauty of her, who
was utterly unworthy to wear so precious a Jewel of nature, albeit expulsing
at last, the fever of his dombe traunse, with kyssyng her white and delicat

hetheru^to (to my great pain) in thutermost part of my intrailles, which
long sins had sought a vent to burst out in open flame, if the dew of the
hope of that favor which now I find in you, had not served as a necessary

feling now with in her heart certain mocio^s assayling the secret of her

could I impute that to your rashness, which by your letters you have termed a
cruelty in me, for your suit has not ben of such continuance, as it may
crave sentence in post, nor your travail so painful as the reward ought to
follow with such hot expedition, albeit as you feel your own hurt (not
escapinge peradventure without some panges of affection,) So you must think
the martyredom is not peculyar to one, but diuidyng himself into a like
SIMPATHIA of passion, has wayed us both in thindiferent balance of affection,
for if love has buylte his bower in the botome of your heart, I must confess
unto you sir, that I draw under the yoke of his awe, neither is my torment any
thing inferior to yours, whereof I had long (ear this) given you understanding,
by plain practi se, if the veil of shame (a comen enemy to the amorous
enterprises of us women) had not covered mine eyes, and closed my mouth with
fear that I durst never (why lest my husband was at home) cast forth such
baytes of the great good will I have borne you (sins you wear our neighbor)
whereby you might perceive with what loyaltye I have chosen and adopted you
thonlye owner if my heart, and with whom I wyshe to pass the remainder of my
life with such pleasure and contentement, as is necessary for the solace of
twoe true lovers, which last words (for the more assurance of the bargain)
she forgot not to seal with sundry sorts of kysses and other homlye tricks
of familiarity, whereby the knight being absolutlye resolved of that which
earste he douted, began to take possession of her mouth, adorynge her eyes
with looks of loving admiration, and passing in order to her whyt neck of the
color of the fresh Lylye, came at last to behold her bare breasts, semynge
like two little hyls or mountains enuironnynge a rosye valleye of most
pleasant prospect, which he forgot not humbly to honor with the often print
of his mouth. And passing some space in these amorous traffiques with a
thousand other sleights of folly, whereof our vain lovers have no lack when
they seem to dispute of pleasure with contentement of desyere, they entered the
lystes of their singular combat, in a fair feeld bed redye dressed for the
purpose, where PARTHONOPE, encounterynge his pleasante enemy with no less
force and courage of his part, then she had grounded experience to wythstande
his malice in such exploits, entered the breach, which so many had made
assaltable to his hand, and being in possession of the commen place of
PANDORA she found him so valiant in thaffaires of her desyer, that in respect
of the loftye courage of this new champyon, she accounted all the rest but
children that erst had traded with her in the like traffic, wherefore from
thinstaunt she gave him such assured place in her friendship, that hanging
wholly upon the shoulders of Parthenope, she had no quiet in her mind but when
her eyes wear occupied in beholding his presence, neither was he (for his
part) void of like affection, for being enchaunted with the charms of this
venomous Basile, he Employed his time to court her continually with his
company, defying al felicities in the world, but that which he seemed to receive
by the fellowship of PANDORA, to whom alon he yielded all devotion, with great
humilitye. But this pleasure being of slipper continuance, stale away with the
shortness of time, their great amity converted into indignacion and spitfull
revenge, yea their mutual societic sealed with all assurance of affection in
their hearts, was by and by so separated and utterly dissolved, that it was
never hable to return to his former unity, for sone after the league of this
new friendship, behold the Page sumwhat refreshed by the absence of two or three
months from his mistres, repaires to his old exercise, wherein he found no
worse intertaineme^t at the bonntiful hand of PANDORA, then when he first
tylled the soil of so fertile an I Will, neither would she for all this lose the
company of her new champyon Parthonope, but using the order of leuel coil she
feasted them both indiferentlye of the dishes of one kind of banquet, and
reserved to her self a change of diet at her pleasure. But the Myllannoys

natural curtesye, with the regard of the honor which he held, had not prevailed
above his just cause of indignation in that behalf, wherein albeit he dismissed
the revenge, yet could he not escape thextreme passion of Ielosie, which so
pricked him at the quick, taking away his desire of rest, and in place of
thappetit of sleep, filled his head full of hollow dreams and vain visio^s,
being in short time so transformed with fantasy, that there rose question of
his sudden alteration amongst diverse his familyar friends, whereof one called
EVCYO MARCIANO no less dear unto him by aproued frendshippe then by the law

transforming the lyuelye colloure of your face into a complexion of palenes,
your mind continuallye occupied in solitarye thoughts and wholye changed
into a disposition contrary to your aunciente order. Do you think that I am
either ignorante of your passion, or of the league of love concluded of late
between thunchaste PANDORA and you, Ah good cousin I lamente not so much your
present desaster, as I fear the fall of future Inconveniences like to thunder
upon you, if god preuente not the ylls which threaten you, by taking you out
of the hands of that tyranous she wolf, whose poison is of more perylous
infection, then that which dystilled from the breath of the first PANDORA
whom the two greek poets do affirm to brewe the first vessel of VENEMOVS lycor
that ever came into ye world, Ah las if reason would suffer you as well to
deserne the doings and detestable life of this open hypocryt even from the

hetherunto you have received, but also abhore the gredy apetyte of hers so
given to hunte after contynuall change, neither dismaye you at all, if the
pleasure which you count peculiar to your self, be imparted to an other, far

suspect to supplye the place of your absence, was the first that tilled the

for her unlawful bedfelowes, whereof PARTHONOPE (bowwing a willing ear to the
tale of his kynsman) was driven into no small merueile at the pretye discourse
of the noble acts of this valiant souldyer of VENUS, But MARTIANO although he
saw arguments of remors in the heart of his Cousin, yet he thought his disease
was not utterly cured unless the cause were also taken away, wherefore
pursuing his intent with vehement persuasions, he requested him at last to leave
those traffyques of love, and specially in cases of adultery, for (says he)
they do not only dimynyshe the honor age, renome, and welthe of him that
follows them, but also they are hurtefull to the health of the soul,
forbidden specially by the mouth of god: and for your part (me think) it
were better to marye sum honest gentylwomanne of your own calabre, susteyninge
the honor of your house with passing Calling,

consuming the best time of your age, to depend wholly upon the pleasure of a
shameless and common doxcye, who when she has sucked out the grene Iewse of
your youth, will not stycke (I warrant you) to procure the end of your days
with some miserable and vntimly death, you are not ignorante besides (I am
sure) of the authoryties of diverse histories noting the great number of strange
inco^ueniences, but specially perpetual Infamy, which follows as a dwe reward
to their travel, who not regarding ye dred commandment of God, and health of
their soul, do defile the marriage bed of their neighbor, wherein for my part,
thoffyce of the frendshipe noryshed of long time between us, together with the
respect of indissoluble consangwinytie, moves me not only to expose my advice
so liberally toward you but also to preset unto you this last request, with
semblable importunytye, yt as well for the co^moditys of your self, as
consolacion of those who wish your advancement, you will abandon the haunt of
this barrayn, and woman void of al virtue, whose wicked disposition argues many
ways to late a repentance for you, if in short time you dispatch not your
hand of her acquaintance: wherewith dischardging the true part of a dear
friend, he so coniured his kinsman, that conferring his report with thargument
of lightness he had already noted in his mistres he detested already the
remembrance of her beastly conuersaction, and because he would disclaim her
acquayntance, company and effection which erst he bare her, at one instante
he removed his lodging to yt further part of the City, where within short
time, he married a young gentilwoman daughter to one EVSEBIO IOVIALL no less

The only experience of thy traitorous practice (oh PARIVRED PARTHONOPE) is
not only sufficient of it self to stir up the just exclamacio^s of al
women against the infidelity in men, but also has sowenne such seeds of
perpetual slander in their attemptes of love here after, that thy desloyaltie
toward me (registered for ever in the remembrance of our sect) will hinder
thenterprises of others, whose intententes (tending paraduenture to a more
sinceretie of affection) deserve not to be repulsed by the merit of thy
detestable falshod: And truly for my part I cold never have thought that
faith, purifyed through the ryuers of so many tears, confirmed by the witness
of a thousand sighs, and lastelye (for a more assurance) sealed with so
many oaths had, had so small harbor in the hearts of men now a days, if the
proof of thy unhonest dealinge, had not argued it unto me, with such familiar
example in my self that alas I curse (by good right) the constellacion that
first consented to my nativity and unhappy procreacion, in sufferinge me to
be governed by so hard a destynie or deceived by the most untrue and faithles
SYCOPHANT that ever offered service to any pore gentlewoman: Albeit if I had not
been so liberal to prostitute mine honor, for satisfyinge thy unchaste
desyer, my conscience had been easelye dispensed with all for the penuance of
so great a falte, my heart free from present passion, and I apt enoughe to
forgett the, whose strong charms of extreme love have so enchaunted my senses
and made me subject to thy remembrance, that the small time of thy absence is
no less grievous unto me, then thy present abuse geues me just cause to cry
out openly of thine inordinat cruelty, alas is this the guerdon of thunfained
love I bare the? is thy dispocition so unnatural, to return the precious
meritte of mine honor, with so unthankful a meede of undeserved
discurtesye? have I loved the so entierlie, preferringe the most dear above
all men in thintralls of my heart, to be deprived of thy company when I
exspect to reap the fruits of pleasure with everlasting contynuance of our
society? must I now abandon the fruicion of thy presence, being wholly
resolved in thy affection, and when I crave thy soc cour by great necessetye?
thou art ignorante alas in the case of my extremetie, neither was thou ordained
to bear part of the pinching panges which I feel in my womb proceeding of
the cursed seeds, sown by yt in ye bottom of my belly, stirring even now in
ye parts of my tender sides with such tormente, that only I pore wretch do
bear the pennaunce of the falte dew to us both. If the view of thy former
pleasure, wherewith thou haste been erst so frankly feasted at the bowntyfull
hands of thy PANDORA, can not move the to compassion of her present greffe,
Spare at least to spil the blood of thine own liknes, deryued of the dropps of
the most precious Iewice in the, who harbored (as thy gueste) in the secret
corners of my tender flanks, takes daily norriture with increase of life by
the vital inspiracion of nature, and whose innocence (if I dye by thy
cruelty) will not fail in the other world to sommone the before the high
troane of justice, where* I exspect the just revenge of thundeserued wrong,
wherewith (contrary to the nature of loyal lovers) thou rewardest her, that
earste loved the not so dearly, as now she persecutes the with mortal hate,
even until the last hour of her life.

Pandora.
The first view of this letter was of hard, disgestion to PARTHONOPE, who
albeit the fear which he had, that PANDORA would mordure (as she did in deed)
the fruit conge^le^d of the substance of them both in her intralles,
presented a certain remorse before the eyes of his conscience, yet, because she
would never before let him understand that she was with child, he thought it
was but a new mean to allure him eftesones to the trafficque of her affairs,
whereupon using as little regard to the contents of the letter, as he made small
account of her that write it, dispatched the messenger with this short
answer. Thou shalt (says he) declare to thy mistrys that if she had
heretofore ymparted to me theffect of thy present message she should have
disposed of me and my frendeshippe at her pleasure, but now saying she,
traues my assistaunce by necessity, I commit her to the meede of her own
folly. whereof PANDORA being advertised by the heavy reapport of her FYNEA,
who also alleged despair eftsoon to recover the frendshippe or company of
the knighte, entered furthwyth into such dispocition of malencollie with
ymagynacions of revenge, that conuertinge thappetite of her aunciente love into
an humor of deadly hate, doubted whether she should use force against her
self, for the spite of the villainy he had don to her, or persecute him unto
death whose life she utterly detested, and waueringe thus in contrariety of
opinions, she sought to appease somewhat the furye of her present dolloure, by
recordynge her greet with these lamentable terms.

Alas (says she) if this be the reward of true loyalty, what assurance
may we reappose in constancy? Pandora exclaimeth.
or what meede to be exspected in the vertie of such unfeigned frendshippe, as
I professed to this unthankful and perjured knighte, have I refused the
service of so many gentlemenne, offringe frankly to employe their times under
the beck of my commandment, to make my affection subject to one, who
having already called out of me the fruits of his desyer, smiles now at my
simplicity, and laughes to see me languishe in dule? Ah why were the eyes of
my mind so dymmed with the myste of fond zeal, that I cold not consider the
common malice of men now a days, who preferring their humble service with
all kind of oaths, dienge a thousand times a day for our sakes, yea
offringe their lives to all kind of peril, do seame to remeine prisonners in
the ward of our good will, until their feigned ymportunyties, preuailyuge
above the weak resistance of us poor wretches do place theime in the
possession of their desyer, and being once made Lords over that, which only
cold command them before, God knowethe how sone they reuolte, torninge
their seruente affection, into a contempt of our fragilitie? if I had as
carefully cast all arguments, of future disquiet, as I was ready to open
mine ears to the sugared breathe of his charms, I had eschewed the evil
with the cause, neither had I stand (as I do now) ready to enter into the
hard pennaunce of my former folly: Ah, most unthankful PARTHONOPE how
canste thou so easelye forgette her, who was no nigarde in satysfyenge thy
desyers, and whose beauty thou seemedeste earste to have in no less admiracion
then if I had been sent from above for thanlie solace of my life has
thy present cruelty prevailed wholly above the glory of thine aunciente
virtue: or haste thou utterly dismissed the remembrance of thy oath, and
protestacion of faith, which ought to call thy conscience to a remorse
forcinge a performaunce of thy promise? whereof also (says she) casting
her waterie eyes down to her big belly) thou have left me a pawn which
witnessing no less thy disloyaltye against me, then aduowching the
frendeshippe thou haste found at my hand, ought to knock at the door of thy
conscience for some consideracion of pity toward her, whom without cause
thou doste shamefullie abuse? Oh, unhappy and wretched Lady that I am, in
what company can I show my head, wherein the bigness of my belly (bringing
the blodd of shame into my face) will not accuse me of treason toward my
husband, being so long time absente, what wrong does the world to my
wickedness, if every man salute me by the name of a common and arraunde
strompette? who defacing^ her ^^nciente honor and house, with the lasciuidus
exercise of adulterous abuse, deserves to be registered in the staunderous book
of black defame with a crown of infamy for ever? whereunto like as thy subtle
practices (Oh ^ayty^e knight) has advanced me, so thy tyrany in ye end shall
take away the life of those, ii. who ought to be far more dear unto the,
then thou seamest to account them: wherewith fallinge into Herself and the
child with in her,
alteracions of more furye, she began a cruel war with her fair hairs,
printinge her nails (without respect) in the rosye dye of her fair face,
bedewinge her bossome and skirtes of outward garments with the drops of
tears distilling from her cristal eyes, and entering thus into ye pageant of
rage, had here played the last act of the tragedy in executinge herself, if
the presence of FYNEA had not prevented the fact, who stirringe up rather the
appitit of revenge in her mistrys, then mynistringe perswacions to patience or
moderacion in her dollor, incensed her by all the wicked devises she cold
ymagyne, to wreake her just anger upon the villanons body of him that so
synisterlie procured her passion of undeserved dule, whereunto albeit PANDORA
gave diligent ear, with desyer to put her advise in execution, yet, having
not utterly drayned her stomach of all complaints renewed estsones her
exclamacion in this sort.

Ah. says she why was not I traded in the magical sciences Nedea and Circe,
2, great enchannteresses,
of the COLCHOSE MEDEA or thytalyan CIRCE whose conninge (workinge marvelous
in the like affairs) has left an ymortalitie to their names to al ages,
certainly if the heavens had revealed unto me any skill in the mystery of their
arts, either should PARTHONOPE be mine, or else would I rain the shower of
vengance upon him and her that enjoys the mede of my merit. with such
ympetuosytie, that the sequeile of the world should have no less cause to
cronicle my doings, then they seame commonly to confirm and allow thactes of
the it. former enchaunteresses. And thou FYNEA shol^est have me to forgett him,
in whose love I doat, although I wish nothing so much as his utter
destruction: And now do I see the do reward of my former unchaste
conversation, for the seruente affection which I bear him, does now yield me
doble vsur^e of the want on liberty wherein I have lived hetherunto, neither
shall I be enjoined to other penance for my falte, then a loathesome despair
which atte^des (if I do not recover him whom I have lost, or have spedie means

Wherefore being resolved in some part to follow thy advise, So must I also use

say) is not without great stoare of conninge sorcerers, amongst whom it is
necessary that thou learn (what so ever it cost) some enchauntement of so
great virtue, that it may not only restore me eftesones to the friendship of

of the vale.

inscrutable) is content sometime to suffer those confurers and enchaunters, the

their own infidelity, to work many great and incredible wounders. As we

those infedels, together with all such as vnhappelye lysten to their
pernicious doctrine.

Here PANDORA seeing all her devises (accompanied with a crooked fortune)
return a success contrary to her meaning, began to enter into a new
passion of such rage and despair, that she had even now dismissed the
residue of her days by the fatal dome of her own hands, if she had not been
eftsoon interupted by FINEA, who for thappeasinge of her present dule,
preferred unto her the aid of a graye friar, a great ghostly father in that
City, whom she affirmed to have wroughte marvelous effects by the healpe of
certain distilled waters tempered with the iewice of strong herbs, growing

hands so clean washed from the covetous desyer of fylthie gain, but he
received certain pieces of gold of Pandora, whom he persuaded should buy
certain drogues and other necessaries, which he thought convenient for the
making of his Diabolical confection: but to be short these charms and
deceitful perfumes of the freare, were of equal operation in this enterprise,
to the herbs and other healpes lately gathered in the vale Camonika by the
woman of Pandora, who seeing her self utterly defied of fortune, in receiuyng
semblable success in all her magical devises, expectynge withal a spedie

upon the fruit sturryng in her own womb, being now vj. months since she
conceived, thinkyng she should never be void of desyer, to see PARTHONOPE, or
at least to revenge his treason, until she had utterly extirped the roots of
that seed which he had sown in the soil of her tender sides. Oh crueltye
more then barbarous? Is it possible that a Gentelwoman of so tender years,
derived of honest parentage, norrished in civility, and that which more is, a
Christian, borne in the heart of EVROPE, should so much forget the fear of God

with great force, drinking cawdels made for the nonst, and swallowinge
diverse other pouders of such strong confection, that their vehement operation
within her, had been able to prevail above the strength of the highest
complexion of the world. Albeit seeing her exspected success of this
beastelye pollecye, was also denied her, she devised a last mean for the
accomplishment of her enterprise, which the veraye ennemy of nature (I am
sewer) would abhor to ymagine, which was, that seeing she could not be
delivered by the assistaunce of sorceries, purgacions, nor other pollecie,
which the art of enchauntynge was hable to lend her, she resolved (as a
bloddie boocher of her own blood) to break the bed of thin^ant A deuelish of

was assisted by FINEA, who acaccordynge to the commandment of her mystresse,
carriynge a silver basyn into the highest torret in the house, went thither
immediatlye both together, where after the doares were shot on all sides,
Pandora with a troubled countenance all pantinge, for the horror of the act
which she meant to execute, beholdynge her bellye with serpentine eyes
sparklynge with flames of fury, said unto her maid, like as alas thou
know FINEA, how extremelye I am delte withal at the hands of the
thrisewretched Parthonope, who without any respect to the pain which I
endure) has utterly disclaimed mine acquaintance, with less regard to
preserve the seeds which he has grafted and left growinge within me, even
so thou art not ignorant of thindeuour I have used to reclaim him, and
rampyer my self eftsoon in his favor, whereof the one is no less vnlikelye,
then the other dangerous: and being spyted of fortune, heaven and carthe
seame also to bend the force of their malice against mine attemptes. Albeit I
could somewhat moderate the extremetie of my passion, if the view of my great
bellye, did not renew the rage of my fever, wherein I dye a thousand times,
having any thing before mine eyes that either represents his lieknes, or
moves any cause of remembrance of that detestable wretch, who (as I hope)
shall never take pleasure in any child of his engendered in the body of
Pandora: and as I have assayed diverse ways (as thou know) to discharge me
of this burden, wherein I have nothing prevailed because my destenie contends
against my endeavor. Euenso being not hable any longer to conceile my falte nor
cover my womb swelled with the wicked sede of his generation, and seeing
withal, my husband is now upon the point of his return, I am determined to
commit my life to extreme peril, to thend to dispatche me of this burden,
which I hate as much as other women take pleasure to bear, and bring forth with
so great conte^tement. And if I could as largelye co^mande over him, as I have
power to work the spyte of his wrong upon the pawn he has left within me, I
assure thee, these hands should make no less strange Anotomy of his carcas,
then I mean forthwith in thy presence to dismember the monster which by his
act I feel stir in the Inner parts of my raines, wherewith FINEA hearing this
deuelish resolucion, preferred persuasions to the contrary, alledgynge that
the horror wear to great; that a mother should become the tyrannous murdresse
of her self and child at one instant, and (says she) touching your being
with child, there be means enough to keep it secret without using any
crueltye, in killyng thinnocent creature, which ought not to bear the penance
of the fault of the father, tush, tush, says this she wolf and merciles

do away these persuasions and dispose thy self to assiste me, for otherwise
thou shall see me dye in thy presence, and then thy preaching shall be in vain
to her that is absolutely resolved to pursue the end of her meaning, what is
it then that I shall do, says FINEA, to whom (as a cruel MEGERA coming out
of the hollow and dark places of thinfernal valleys, she enjoined her this
first charge, get thee up, says she, upon that high coffer there, and I will
spread my bellye alonge upon the ground with my back upward. And so with all
thy force thou shalt leap upon my Keynes, which I hope will be a mean to open
an Issue for this cursed burden which is so grievous for me to carye, wherein if
thou use thutermost of thy force, thou shalt restore me to spedye
contentement. But if thou spare to employe thy whole strength, thou shalt
prolonge my pain, driuynge me to make mine own hands the ministers of my
meaning FINEA not likyng greatly the charge of such commission, and much
less the execucion in so horrible a manner, although the terror of the fact
troubled her for a time: Yet being of long time acquainted with the
conditions and crueltye of her mystres, mounts upon the high chest, leapinge
seven or eyghte times together upon the back of Pandora, with such
impetuositie that any man would have thought that so many blows with the
heuye swaigh of all her body, had been hable to have broken the bones of her
back, and dispatched the mother and child together. But all these trafficques
being in vain, prolonged but the pain of Pandora, who doubling her rage with
this repulse of her enterprise, entered into devises of more mischief and
tyranny not almost to be talked of, what heart alas is so endurated with the
metal of hardness, but the horror of this hellyshe crueltye, will move it to
destil drops of blood? what countenance so assured that cane wythhold his
tears, or not shrinck at the tyranous disposition of this lioness? or what
hears will not stand up at the tragical discourse of this strange kind of
child bearing. Truly I know that virtuous Ladies (sprinkled with the dew
of pytie,) will not only tremble at the remembrance of the inordinate
crueltye of this cursed mother, but also open the conduits of their
co^passions, weping on ye behalf of the torment wherein unnaturally she plunged
the innocent impe which nature had formed of the substance of her self, who
converted from the shape of a woman into the disposition of a deuel, raginge
without measure, that she could not be delivered, howled out at last with a
horrible cry full of impietye and blasphemye in this sort. Saying (says she)
that both God and the deuell deny me their assistance, I will (in spighte of
their powers) ryd me of thee. Oh cursed and execrable creature, where with
possessed wholye with the spirit of fury, having her eyes sonke into her head,
her stomach panting, and her face all full of black blood, by the vehemency
of the conflicte which she had endured, began to leap withal her force from
the tope of the coffer down to the ground, brosing her sides with her hands,
and playinge on the drum with her fystes upon her great bellye, with such huge
blows, that felyng even now the little creature within her removed from his

well for that she saw so fair a creature driven out of his habitacion before

deseruynge both to be invested with the tytell of cursed parents and blodye
bochers of the seeds congealed of their own substance, saving that the end
of this infortunat Infant was more tragical, and the doings of his mother more
detestable, who exceeding the brutuall crueltye of the wolf, tygres^e, or
Lioness rauenynge amongst the flock of lyttel lambs in the fatt and fertyll
feldes of LIBIA, saying her thus discharged of her burden, began also to
dysmysse the greatness of her dolor, and beholdinge with her eyes, (shyninge
like ye blase of two torches with the flame of furye) the newborn creature
sprawling in the basyn, began to whett her tethe, shakinge her head with
horrible regards prognosticatinge the last act of the rage which she haddes
yet to play, saying unto FYNEA, doste thou not see how this lyttel beast
resembles already the Image of his pariured father, behold I pray the his
countenance, and mark ye sundry liklehods that even now appear in his face,
arguing undoubtedly that (if life would give leave to his Inclynacion) his
detestable disposicion would be nothing Inferyor to yt vil lanie of him whose
traiterous dysloyaltye has made me (as thou feast) ye cursed mynister of
inordynat crewelty, And If I had ye like power over him yt is ye cause of this
unnatural passion, I would assuredlye enjoin him such penance, that his,
just chastysmente should import a terror to all traitors that hereafter
should seek to seduce any Lady by sugared words, wherewith bendinge her lokes
toward the little Impe (hastinge to his end by the second conflycte he
had endewred by his mother and her maid, before his eyes wear unsealed to
see the light of this world,) she wished eftsoon the presens of PARTHONOPE
upon whom (says she) sith I am vnhappelye denied to wreake my vengaunce in
such sort as I would, at leasts I will content my self for the time, to see
the ponyshed in the place of him, whose pycture thou rightlye presents, as a
true patorne shaped of the mass of his substance, and saying thy destenye is
to incur the penance due to thy father, the pain of thy erecucion shall be
nothing inferyor to the meryt of his execrable falt, wherein says she, arm
your selves, (Oh my hands) with courage, and shrink not to be the mynisters
of the ponishiment which my tongue has pro nounced, rejoice Oh my heart in the
^ffusion of his blodd, whose de the brings repose to the long passion of thy
dolors, and you mine eyes laughe your full to se the dismembringe of him, whom
I mean to offer as a sacrafyse of vengaunce on the behalf of PARTHONOPE,
whose remembrance (with the blodde of his son) I will presentlye rote out of
my mind for ever. Certenlye good Ladies my heart abhorring no less the
remembrance of this bychfore, then my spirit trobled with tremblinge fear at
the contynaunce of her creweltye, gives such impediment to my pen, that it is
scarce hable to discribe unto you, the last act of her rage, wherein this
lymme of thinfernal lake, not worthy any longer to bear the name of a woman,
procedinge to the end of her enterprise, takes up her son with her bloodye and
murderinge hands, whom without all compassion, and contrary to the order of a
christian, she beats with all her force against the walls, painting the
posts and pauements in the chamber with the bloddde and brains of the
innocent creature new borne, wherewith not yet contented nor satisfied in her
rage, she takes in either of her hands one of the tender legs of the child
now dead, and dividing them as the bocher joints his lamb or young goat
which he lays upon his staulle to be sold, fell of a sodayn laughter in sign
of the great pleasure she took in this execution, wishing notwithstanding to
enter into the same exercise with him of whom this deformed carrion (as she
termed this dismembered Infant) took his first beginning. Here if I should
prefer the particular discourse of the exploits of this second MEDEA and
erecrable monster of our time, I could not escape (I am sure) without the secret
grudges of some, who having made large sale of their honor at to lo we a
price, and getting in like sort ye byt of frantike Ialo^ye between their teth,
do stodye nothing but the art of reueng, albeit because ye virtue of honest and
chastladies shall s^ine the clearer, by the dark eclipse of such common enemies
of the whole sect Femenyne, I will yet treat of the tyrany of this PANDORA who
reserved thextreame point of her Iewishe creweltie until the last act of her
tragedye, for marteringe the dead child, and treadinge it under her fete, she
thrust her hand under his short rybbes, and taking out his heart, gnawed it
(as a bych of HERCANIA) between her teth into littell morsels, saying that she
hoped one day to provide the like banquyt for PARTHONOPE, which should
confirm the quiet she felt in the present death and detestable execucion of
his Image and likeness, and having her had yet dyed with the blodd of this
guiltles impe of nature, she told not be ryd of the importunat devil that
possessed her, until she had brought ye river of her rage unto thextreme brink
of tyranny, neither could her heart be brought to appeasement so long as her
eyes fed upon the view of the dead infant: Wherefore calling in a great
mastyphe cur, she gave him (by pecemeale) the members of her child, an act
suer of no less detestacion before the high throne of God, then to be abhorred
of all the world. Ah las, have thytalyan mothers no other ^ombes for their
children, the^ to bury them in ye belly of a dog? be these the tears
wherewith they accompanye them into the shrouding shete? Is this the curtesy of
Italye? or a creweltie derived of the barbarous nation? but how cold she expose
other frewtes outwardly, then according to the nature of the spirit which
possessed her within, for the devil being seized of her heart, made her body
and other members the mynisters of her will, which God does oftentimes suffer as
well for the due correction of heinous faults, as also for an example, and
terror to all offenders in the like affairs. I am loathe good Ladies to pass
any further in the pursuit of this dolorous tragedye, because your eyes (already
wearyed with wepinge,) methinke I see also your ears offer to close themselves
against ye report of this PANDORA, whose only offense had been enough to stain
your whole sect with per petual i^amie, if ye pure chastity of so many of you
offered not to confute the slander by your virtue only, neither ca^ ye
impudente and wicked liffe of such double curtalls as (she was) impair
thestimacion of them, that with thintente of pure integrity, do rather give
suck to their honor with ye milk of simplicytie: then being Italyonated with all
subteltyes, trustinge only in the humor of their own brain, do fall at last
into the common slander of all the world: for a famylyar proof whereof I leave
you to skanne the order and doings of this PANDORA, who waringe now somewhat
cold in her former passions of frensye and rage, began to be pinched with the
panges Incydente comenlye to all women, in the paynfull travel of child
bearinge, wherefore goinge to bed she caused certain baynes to be provided,
wherein washinge her self, the next day being hallowed and a feast of great
solempnytye, she was carried in a rych coche to vysitt the company of other
Ladies, amongeste whom she was not worthy to keep place, being the shameful
bother of her own blood, and wicked ennemy to the life of man. Herein is to be
noted the destructiun of a woman banished the pallays of reason together with
the due mede of their merytt, who for the respect of a little pleasure, (of no
more contynuance then a moment) do put their honor upon terms of Infamye,
and there souls in hazard of everlasting tormente, here the adulterers may
see how iustelye God ponysheth their infydelytie and breach of oaths toward
their husbands, let also the young ladies and lyttel girls learn to direct the
course of their youth by ye contrary of this example. and being once registered
in the book of marriage, let them stand upon their guard, for falling into ye
like folies, for there is nothing committed in secret, but in ye end it bursts
out to a common brute, which our savior Christ affyrmeth by the mouth of ye
prophet sainge, yt what so ever is done in the darkest corner of the house,
shall be published in ye end in open audience, And he who sekes most to conceile
his fault, is not only (by the permission of God) the first opner of the
same, but also bears the badge of shame before the face of ye world, and
stands in danger of grace in the presence of him from whom no secret can
be hid.

FINIS
The argument.
IT may seame to some that delighte in the report of other men's faltes with
respectt rather to take occasion of synister exclamacio^, then be warned by
their evils to eschew the like harms in the^ selves, that I have been to
prodigal in notinge the doings and lives of diuerle ladies and gentlewomen
declininge by misfortune, from the path of virtue and honor, only to stir up
cause of reproach, and leave argument to confirm their fond opinion: Albeit
as their error appears sufficiently in the integretye of my meaning, so I
hope thindifferent sort will give an other judgment of my entente, the rather
for that I have preferred these discourses both for the proffit of the present
glory of them that be paste, and instruction of such as be to come, seeing
wc al they discover more cause of rebuke and vices more heinous in men, then
any we find committed by women, and albeit the historye last recyted has set
fourth in lively colors the furye and madd dispocition of a woman forced by
disloyalty, yet if a man may any way excuse sin, it may in some sort be
dispensed with all, or at least with more reason then the tyranous execution
followinge committed by a man without occacion, where a certain Ielousye
sprung of an unjust myslyke (as she thought) is ready to cover the falte of
Pandora, for what is he so ignorante in the passions of love, that will not
confess that Ielosye is an evil exceeding all the Ielosye excedes all the
torments in the world.
torments of the world, supplantinge oftentimes both wytt and reason in the
most wise that be, specially when appears the like treason, that Pandora
persuaded her self to receiuely him that forsook her, but for the other, how ea^
he be acquitted from an humor of a frantike man, who without any cause of
effence in the world committes cruel excution upon his innocente wife, no less
fair and fournished in all perfections, then chaste and verteous with out
comparison, neither is Ioylowsye the cause of morder considringe that the
opynion is no sooner conceived, then there follows (as it were) a distrust of
the party that thinks to receive the wrong, with an indifferent desyer to
them both to stand upon their guard in sort like ii, enemies workinge the
mutual destruction the one of the other, whereof leaving the judgment to them
that be of good stomach to digest all kinds of meats, or can carye a brain
to ^^kle with the fumes of every brothe that is offered them, I have here to
expose unto you a miserable accident happening in our time, which shall serve
as a bloddye skaffolde or theaterye, wherein are presented such as play no
parts but in mortal and furious tragideies.

AN ALBANOYSE Captain being at the point to dye killed his wife because no
man should enjoy her beavvtie after his death....
DUringe the sege and miserable sack of MODONA. (a City of the mores
confyning upon ye sea PELOPONESE not far from ye strait of YSTHMYON, by ye
which the venetians conueighe their great traffic and trade of
merchandise,) Baiazeth the emperor of the turks, and great grandfather to
SVLTAN SOLOMON who this day governs the state of thoriente, used so many
sorts of inordinat cruelties in the persecution of those wretches, whom fate
with extreme form of his war had not only habandoned from the soil of their
ancient and natural bode but also (as people full of desolation and void of
succor every way) forced them to crave harbor of the lymytrophall towns
adjoining their country, to shroude there weary bodies bledinge still with the
wounds of their late war, and overcome besides with the violence of hungar
and cold (ii; common Hunger and cold 2. common enemies attendinge the camp of

general calamity every man has his fortune: So amongst the unhappy crewe
of these fugitives and creatures full of care, there was one gentleman no les

any place to the injury of present time, consideringe that in every distress
fortune bearethe the greateste swaighe whose malice is neither of perpetuity
nor yet to be feared of such as have their hearts armed with assurance in
virtue, for as she is no less uncertain of her self, then her doings full
of mutabilitie, so according to thaduice of the philosopher, she is to be used
with such indifferency of all estates, that we neade neither, laughe when
she smyles, nor fear when she threats, neither has she any to follow the
chariot of her victory, but the caityffe or Toward and such as are denied

and benifet of true virtue. This gentleman (whom mine author terms by the
name of PIERRO BARZO) weary eue^ now with drawinge the heavy yecke of hard
erile, left the rest of his contrymen and companions of care, complaining their
mutual myseries together, and retired to the rythe and populous City of
MANTVA, where his cyuell gouernemente, and prudent behauior) accompanied with a
singular dexterity in exploytes of arms and other exercises of the ualrye,
arguinge thunfayned noblenes of his mind) gave such a show of his virtue,
that he was not only in short time entertained of the marquis and governor
there, but also made general of the whole army of footmen, where Virtue
yeldes good fruits to such as embrace her unfeignedly.
enioyinge thus the benefyt of his virtue, who commonly yeldes no less
success to such as embrace her with true ymytacion, and tread the pathe of
her loare with semblable sinceretie of mind he had there with him at the same
instante his wife, being also of MODONA, derived of no less nobilytie then
he, and nothing inferior in all gifts of nature and ornaments of virtue,
for touching her beauty, seaming of such wonderful perfection that it was
thought nature was driven to the end of her wits in framinge a piece of so
great excellency, they dowted not to give her thereby the title of the fair
Helene of greece, nether was she less meritorious for her virtues being blessed
therewith so plentifully at the hands of thalmighty, that it was doubted to the
writers of that time whether god or nature deserved the greatest prays in
forminge so perfect a creature. If this were a consolation and singular
contentment of the pore MODONOYSE (waighinge earste in the balance of his
unhappy fortune, denied any more to enjoy the fredome of his country,

changed their miserable condition or state of aduersytie, with the benefyt and
goodness of the like fortune, or if again he had cause to rejoice and make
sacrifice to his fortune, that had given him a wife noted to be the odd Image
of the world for beautye, behavior, courtesey, and vprighte dealyng, constant

ornement and decoracion of the beauty of a woman) The chiefest virtue in a
wise, is to be obedient to her husband
to be of disposition ready to obey her husband, yeldinge him suffraintye
with a deutifull obedience, with other virtues that made her an admiration to
the whole multitude, and her life a spectacle to the Laoyes of our age, to
behold and Imitate the like virtues, I leave it to the Judgment of that small
number of happy men, who (by a special grace from above) are ordained to
enjoy the benefyt of so rare and precious a gift. This couple thus reioysinge
the return of happy life, resigned with all their tears of ancient dule,
and embraced the gift of present time, with intent to spend the remainder of
their years in mutual co^solacion and contertement of mind, wherein they were
assisted with a second blessyng of God, who for the increase of their new
comfort, sent them a daughter, who in beautye, virtue, and all other gifts of
grace did nothing degenerate from the pattern and mould from whence she was
derived, whereof she gave great shows as nature seamed to increase her years
and conferme her in discrecion. But what assurance is there in the pleasure of
people, saying the world hit self is appointed his date, which he can not
pass, or why should we repofe a perpetuitye in our worldly afaires, saying
that both their continuance and confidence ends with the length of time? And

whereof she gave a manifest declaration in the person of this fair Lady, from
whom she took her dear husband in the flower of his years, and she not yet
confermed in age and discretion hable to bear and withstand thordinarye
assaults of the world, which she found also of more uneasy tolleracion,
as well for the fervent zeal and affiance which law of kind did bind her to

then to keep in entyer the small revenue left unto her by her husband, she
took order with her domestical affairs according to her present fortune, and
so dismissing her ordinary train of servants, retired to a brother of hers

Gentelman thereabout, having for the credit of his virtue and valiantnes in
Arms, the charge of certain troops of horsemen, who glauneynge at unawares
upon the glystrynge beams of her beauty, became so desirous eftsoon to
encounter the same, that with the often view of her stately personage and
general fame of her many virtues, he became so in love with her, that (for
spedye ease of his present grief) he was driven to put his request upon
terms, making first his sighs and sad countinance, his sollitary
Complexion of face often given to change, his dolorous state. and pytifull
regardes of the eye when he was in her company, forced now and then to
abandon the same, because he could not keep him from tears, his often
gretynge her with salutations in amorous order, courtyng her now and then with
letters, dyttyes, and presents of great price, with a thousand other vain
importunityes which love does ymagine to animate his Soldiers, his chiefest
Ministers to bewraye his intent and solicit his cause, whereof the effect
returned no less frustrate, then the devise yt self ought to seame vain in
the eye of all wife men, for she whose heart could not be earste perced with
the malice of her former fortune, nor be brought to stowpe to the lure of
aduersitye, thought it a great fault to let love or folly make any breach,
where so many hoate assaults and causes of despair had been valiauntlye
resysted and utterly repulsed, for proof whereof, being wholly wedde as yet to
the remembrance of her dead husband, she would neither admit his clyentes,
nor give audience to his ambassadors, but dismissed both the one and the
other with semblable hope, which brought the Captain in such case, that it
seamed to him a harder matter to compass the good will of his Lady, then to
govern an army or plant a battrye with the advantage of the ground and
place, neither was he hable to wythdrawe his affection or mortifye the fire
newly burst out to flame, because the remembrance of her beautye, the often
view of her virtue enlarged by the general fame of all men, together with the
noblenes of her race enrolled in the records of Antiquitye, presented a more
desyere in hy n with care to obtain her, and aggrauated his grief in being
repulsed of that which his heart had alredye vowed to honor till the extreme
date of his days, neither had he the face eftefones to attempt her of him
self, and much less to de^yste from the purseute of his desyere, but being
at the point to incur the hazard of despair, behold love preferred a new
and most sewer mean, willing him to crave the assistaunce of her brother,
who being his dear friend and companion in arms in the service of diverse

your nature has been always no less peculiar, then to me now a courage in

discerned, then in making the greffe of the one common to both, and bear the

and fortune indifferentlye with mutual affection and like zeal on both
parts, wherein for my part I would I had as good mean to make declaracion
of my true heart toward you, as of long time I have vowed to be yours to the
vttermoste of my power, and you no less desyer to do me good, then your
diligence and assistance of frendshippe is most hable to stand me in stead
in my present case of no less importance then the very sauegarde of my life,
which last words made the Modonoyse replye with like frank offer of mind,
protest ynge unto him by the faith of a soldiour, that if ever he felt any
mocion in him self to do him the least good of the world, his desyer was
double to requite it proferinge here with, for a further show of his good
meaning, and declaration of faith, to rack his power on his behalf so far
fourth, as either life, living, or honor would bear him, but he whose desyer
tended not to things impossible, nor sought to maintain war against the
heavens, reaposinge much for him self in the offer of his frinde, thought the
conquest was half wone, when he had promised his assistaunce, and because there
lacked nothing but to utter his grief, he told him that the thing he
desyered would bring advancement to them both, and because says he, I will
clear the doubt which seames to trouble you, you shall understand that the
beautye, gifts of grace, and other honest parts in your sister, have so
inchaunted my senses, that having alredye lost the use of my former liberty,
I can not eftesones be restored with out the spedye assistaunce of her good
will, neither have I other power of my self, or consolation in my present
extremity, then such as is derived of the hope which I have hereafter to
enjoy her as my lawful wife, for otherwise I am as void of foul meaning
to work her dishonnor for the seruent love I bear her, as free from intent
to procure so great a spot of infamy to the house which norrished you both
in so great honor. And to be plain with you, the glymerynge glances of her
twinklynge eyes, together with a princely maicstie which nature has leute her
above the rest of the Dames of our days, has made my heart more assaltable and
apt to admit parley, then either the noise of ye canon or terror of the
enemy, how great soever they have appeared, have hertofore feared me, which
makes me think that there is either some celestial or divine mystery shrouded
under the veil of her beautye, making me thereby yield her honor in hope of
preferment, or else by the angry consent of my cursed dostines, it is she that
is appointed to pay thintrest of my former liberty, in transformynge my
ancient quiet into a thousand anoyes of uneasy tolleracion. And albeit I have
hethertd reserved the maydenhed of my affection and lived no less free from
thamarous delites or desyers of women, yet being now overtaken and tied in the
chains of true affection, I had rather become captive and yield my self
prisoner in the pursuit of so fair a Lady, then to have the honor of the
greatest victory that ever happened to Captain by prowess or policy or
dynt of cruel sword of his valiant soldiers, wherefore as your authority
with your sister, is rather to command, then entreat, and by the frendshipppe
which has remeined indissoluble between us from the beginning, never gyuynge
place to any peril what so ever it were; I conjure you, and as my last
request beseech you, to aid me herin so farfurth as your diligence may seame
to work my desyer to effect, whereunto the Modonoyse replied with great
thanks for the honor he offered him and his sister, whom he half promised
alredye to frame according to his expectation, promisinge himself a great
good happ not only in entryng into allyaunce with so noble a Gentleman, but
also that he should be the worker of the same, wheruppon embracing each
other, the one glad to see so happy a success like to follow his business, the
other no less joyful to have so fytt a mean to manifest his frendshipp to
wards his friend; departed with semblable contenteme^t, the one to his lodging
with a thousand hammors in his head till he saw the effect of his dryfte, the
other with no less grief of mind till he had performed the exspectation of
his charge, wherein he began immediatlye to practice with his sister, whom he
found of a contrary opinion, excusing her self with the care she had of her
daughter, whom she said she would neither leave alone, nor commit her self
to the order and government of strangers, at whose hands there is as great
doubt of good entratye, as small help or hope of amendment being once made
their vassalt and subject by law of marriage, besides (sir) says she not
without some tears, it is not yet a year since I lost him, whom if I loved by
awe being on live, I ought with no less duty to honor after his death,
neither cold I avoid the just murmr and ordinary suspicion of the peopls,
y^ I should seame more hastye to yield my affection to other, then ready to
perform my duetye and ceremonies of dule to him that is dead, and that with in
the year before the funeral be fully ended, the widows life is also pure of it
self, bound to no care nor controlement of any, and so acceptable before God,
that thapostle doubts not to account her among the number of the religious,
if after she have once tasted of marriage and restored again to her liberty,
she content her self with the first clogge or burden of bondage, lyuinge
after in ymitacion of true virtue, besides the holy man Saint Augustine
diswadeth all wydowes eftesones to marie, aduising them to mortify such
mocio^s as the flesh is apt to stir up and norrishe, by contemplacion and
prayer, and true sincerity of life, saying further that they are accounted
before God amongst the number of chaste and pure virgins. And because it may
be paraduenture thoppinion of some, that the burden of widowed is grievous and
almost intolerable unto me, presuming the same rather by the greenes of my
youth (not yet cofirmed in rypenes of years and discretion) then upon any good
or assured ground to iustifye their opinion, I assure you, I feel my self so
plentifully assisted with the spirit of grace, that I doubt no more to
withstand all temptations and vain assaults which the wicked instigations of
the flesh may hereafter minister unto me, then heretofore in tender years when
nature denied any such mocion to stur in me, I lived free and void of suck
prouocatio^. And for end good brother, my heart, deuining diversely of the
success of this marriage, threatens a further mischief to fall upon me, and
to late a repentance for you that is the unfortunate causer of the same. Here
her brother knowing it a fault in all women to here them selves well spoken of
and yet a chief mean to win them to feed their humor with flatterings
prays began to join with her in commendacion of her honesty, affirmynge her
chaste conversation to be no less meritorious since she was wydowe, then her
pure virginity generally allowed, and praised of all men before she was married,
which is the chiefest cause said he that the Captain desiereth in honest
sort to possess you, but touching any sinister success that might follow this
sacred league of lawful matrimonye as she seamed to predestinate within her
self, he ministered persuacions to to the contrary, alledginge the same to be a
superstitious follye attributed to the auncientes of old time, to calculat
their good or ill success by the tunes or charm of birds, or sometime by the
sudden encounter of beasts or such men as they looked not for, arguing ye
same to be such absolut signs of il luck yt commonly they would refrain
from their affairs as ye day, and touching ye murmur and suspicio^ of the
people whose tongs although they be naturally tipte with the metal of slander
yet ought you as litell says he fear their malice, as care for their grudge,
consideringe your act is no less acceptable before God, then tolerable by the
positive laws of man, neither can they but judge well of your doings and like
better of your choice saying you are woede with great importunyties, and wone
by one that is of your own quality and nothing inferior to you in virtue or
noblenes of race, but if you stick of any ceremonies which you have yet to
perform to him that is dead, your error is greater then you may Iustefye,
and your wisdom less then is necessary in such a case, neither is the
voice of the multitude in that respect of such contynaunce, but time can take
it away and a wonder lasts not for ever, and for my part I hope you will
confer my present meaning in this matter, with the long experienced faith
and affection which heretofore you have noted in me, besides I cold not
avoid thimputacion of a monster and enemy to nature, If I should not be as
careful of your quiet as of my own life, praying you for end and as my last
request to reapose your self wholly upon my faith, and frendshippe and
fidelytye of him, who honoreth you with no less then his life and all that he
has, wherewith he so much prevailed over his obedyent sister, that she being
unhappily ouercom with his vehement importunyties condissended very willingly
to his unfortunate request, which after became the perentory destruction of the
pore wydow, leaving to late and miserable a repentance to her brother: albeit
before I proceed to the ceremonies of her unfortunate marriage, I thought good to
tell unto you in this place thoppynion of mine author touching the dyuynacion
of the spirit of man, who (says he) albeit by a secret instincke and virtue
of the mind, is hable some times to presage that will fall, and the soul
(being divine of it self) does also prognosticate dyuersly of the future
chances and Touching dyuynacion of the mind.
chaunges of things, yet the body (being the house or harborer of the mind)
framed of the substance of claye or a thing of more corruption, does so
prevail and overcome the qualytyes and gifts of the mind, in casting a myste
of darkness before our understanding, that the soul is not only barred to
expose the fruits of reuelacion, but also it is not believed when she
prognosticates a trothe, neither is it in the power of man to shone or shrink
from that, which the foreknowledge of the highest has already determined
upon us, and much less to prevent or withstand the sentence of him, whose dome
is as certain as himself is truth, wherein because I am sufficiently
sustefyed by thauthorities of diverse histories as well sacred as profane, I
will not stand here to enlarge the proof with copy of examples, but referr
you to the readinge of the sequeile of this woeful lady, who although her fate
was reueyled unto her before, yet was she denied to shone the destenye and
sharppe judgment which the heavens were resolved to thunder upon her. But
now to our purpose, thagrement thus made between the fair greek Lady and
don SPADO the valiant Captain, there lacked nothing for consemacion of the
marriage but thassistance of the rites and ancient ceremonies appointed by
order of holly church, which the captain forgot not to procure with all
expedicion of time, and for the more honor and decoracion of the feast he had
there the presence of the marquis of MANTVA, being there not so much for the
honor of the brydegrome, as to testefye to the open face of the world
thearnest affection he bare to her first husband RARZO, whom he accounted no
less dear unto him for credytt and trust, then the nearest friend of his
blod. But now this albanoys enjoy, eng thus the fruits of his desire, cold not
so well brydel his present pleasure, nor conceile the singular contentment he
conceived by the encounter of his new mystres, but in public show began to
prate of his present felicitye, arguinge the same to be of greater moment, then
if he had been frankly restored to the title and dygnitie of a kingdom, giving
fortune also her peculiar thanks, that had kept this good torn in store for
him, saying yt she cold not have honored him with a greater preferment then to
put him into the possession of her who was without a second in all Europe. But
as in every thing excess is hurtful, bringinge with it a doble discomoditie, I
mean both a sourfet to ye stomach by the pleasure we del ite in, and a Jealous
loathing of ye thing we chiefly love and hold most dear, so the extreme and
superfluitye of hoate love of this fond husband toward his wife, began wtin
the very month of the marriage, to convert it self into a contrary disposition,
not much unlike the loving rage of the she ape to The property of a she ape in
embrasing. her young ons.
wards her yongeones, who as ye poets do affirm does use to choose among her
whelps one who^ she loves best, and kepi^g it always in her arms does
cherish and loll it in such rude sort that or she is ware she breketh the
boanes and smothereth it to death, killing by this means with overmuch love ye
thing which yet would live if it were not for thexcesse of her affection, in
like sort this ALBANOYSE doting without discracion upon the desyer of his
new lady, and rather drowned beastely in the superfluity of her love, the^
waighing rightly the merit and virtue of true affection, entered into such
terms of fervent Ielowsie, yt every fle that wastes before her, made him
sweat at the brows with the suspicion he had of her bewty, wherein he
suffers him self to be so much subject and overcome with ye rage of this
folly, that according to the Ielowse humor of thytalyan, he thought every man
that looked in her face, went about to grafte horns in his forehed, Oh small
discrecio^, and less wisdom in one that ought with ye shappe and form, to
merit the name and virtue of a man, what sudden chaung and alteracio^ of
fortune seames now tassayle this valiant captein, who erst loved loyally
wtin the compass of raiso^ and now doting without discrecion, thinks him
self one of the for^ued ministeres of cornwaile, and albeit I must confess
unto you yt ye more rare and precious a thing is of it self, yt more diligence
and regard ought we to use to preserve and keep it in good estate, yet a wise
and chaste woman being one of ye rarest things of the world and special gift of
god, ought not to be kept in ye mew nor guarded with curious and continual wach,
and much less atended upon wc ye jealous eyes of Argus, for like as she yt
waigheth her honor and life in indifferent balance, not meaning to exchange
the one but with the loss of the other, is not easily corrupted by any sugared
train of flattering love, so ye restraint of ye lyberty of womenne, to gether
with a distruste procedinge of none occasion, is the chiefeste mean to seduce
her that else has vowed an honest and integrety of life even until the end
of her natural days, And in vain goes he about to make his wife honest,
that either locks her in his camber or fylles his house full of spies to note
her doings, consideringe the just cause he gyues her hereby to be revenged of
the distruste he has of her with out occasion, saying with all the nature of
some women is to enlarge their liberty that is abridged them in doing the
thing they are forbidden more in disspyte of the distruste of their folyshe
husbands then for any appetyt or expectacion of other contentment to
themselves, neither has this folyshe humor of Ielowzy so much power to enter
into the heart of the virtuous and wise man, who neither will give his wife
such cause to abuse her self toward him, nor suspect her without great
occasyon, nor yet, give judgment of any evil in her, without a sewer ground
and manifest proof, and yet is he of such gouernemente for the correction of
such a falte, that he had rather cloak and digest it with wisdom, then make
publication with open ponishement in the eye of the slanderous world, by
which rare patience and secret dissimulation, he does not only choke the
mouth of the slaunderor, buryinge the falte with the forgetfulness of the fact,
but also reclaymes her to an assured honesty and faith hereafter, that erst
had abused him by negligence and ill fortune: but he which pens his wife in ye
higest vaulteof his house, or tieth a bell at her sleue because he may hear
whether she goes, or when he takes a long journey paintes a lamb of her
belly, to know if she play false in his absence, these sleightes I say do
not only deceive him that deuiseth them, but also gives him for his travel
the true title of coockeholde, in like sort what greater sign or argument can
a man give of his own folly, then to believe that to be true, which is but
doutfull, and yeldinge rashelie to the resolution and sentence of his own
conceits, thinks his wife as light of the sear and apt to deceive him, as he
is ready to admit synister suspicion, which procedes but of an ymperfection in
him self, judging the disposition of an other, by his own complerion, which
was one of the greatest faltes in this valyante ALBA NOISE, who fearing even
now that which he need not to dowte, began to stand in awe of his own
shadow, perswadinge him self, that his wife was nolesse liberal of her love
toward others, then to him, and that the benefit of her beauty was as common
to strangers as to him self, albeit the good Lady espyeng well enough, the
grief of her husband, was not idle for her part, to study the means to
please him, and also to frame her life in such wise every way that her chaste
and discrete government toward him, might not only remouethe veil of his
late susspicion, but also take away the thick miste of frantike Ielowsie,
that put him in such disquiet and made him so far excede the lymites and
bonds of discrecion, albeit her honest endeavor herein received a contrary
effect, and as one borne under a crabbed constellacion, or ordained rather to
bear the malice of a froward desteinye, she cold not devise a remedy for his
disease nor any herb to purge his suspicious humor, but the more she sought
to prefer a show of sincerity and honesty of life, the more grew the furye
and rage of his perverse fancy, thinking the compainye and fellowship of his
wife, to be as indifferente to others, as peculiar to him self.

What life were like to the married man's state, or pleasures semblable to the
joys of the bed, if either the one or the other might be dispensed with all
from the furye of frantique Iellowsie, or amongst a thousand inconveniences
which only the married man does find? what greater mischief may be more for
the dissolutio^ of the mutual tranquillity of them both, then where the one
loves vnfaynedlie, and the other is doubtful without cause, but the ease and
quiet of men are of so small a moment, and their common pleasures so
enterlarded with an ordinary mishappe, that there is as small hold of the one,
slippinge away with the shortness of time, as undoubted assurance to have the
other a common gueste, and haunt us in all our doings, not leaving us till he
has seen us laid in the pit and long bed of rest, whereof I have here
presented you a little proof in the picture and person of this selly ALBANOYSE,
who beginnynge as you have hard, to enter into some terms of Iellowsie with
his wife, with whom notwithstanding he had consumed certain months in such
pleasures as marriage does allow, began to grow more fervent in that furye,
then either his cause did require or wisdom ought to suffer, wherwt setting
abroch the vessel of that poison, forgot not for his first endeavor to dog
the doings of his wife with secret spies in every corner, to abridge her
liberty in goinge abroad, and bar the access of any to come to her, keeping
notwithstanding no less watch and ward abowte her chamber, then the good
soldiour upon his trenche, or circumspecte Captain upon the walls of his
fortress, which brought the selly Lady into such sorrow, that the state of
the caytife and slave of the gallye bownde to his ore with a chain of
unreasonable biggnes, or he that by hard sentence of the Law does lie
miserably in the bottom of a prison all the days of his life, seamed of more
easy regard then the hard condition of her present state, albeit true
virtue has such operation and effect of her self, that how greuouslye
soever the world does persecute her, or seek to crucifye her with the malice
of men, yet can they not so keep her under by any force they can devise,
but certain streams and sparks will Five virtue will alvvayes yeldes fruits
according to the goodness of the thing,
burste out now and then, and show her self at last (as she is hable)
to wythstande the violence of any mortal affliction, whereof an affecte
appears here in the sequeile of this Greek lady, who notinge the disposition
of her husband, ouercharged with a mad humor of wrong conceits, gave
judgment ymedyatlye of his disease, and being not hable utterly, to expulse
his new fever, studied by her endeavor to infer a moderacion of his passion,
wherein for her part, she forgot not to make patience her chiefest defense,
against the folish assaults of his wilful follies, not only requitinge his
extraordinary rage and fits of fury, with a dutiful humylitye and obedience
of a wife, but also ceased not to love him no less then her honor and duty
bound her thereunto, hopinge with thassistance of some convenient time, and her
discrete behauior toward him, both to take away the disease, and mortefie
the cause of his evil she seamed neither to reprehend his falte openly, nor with
other terms then argued her great humility, and for her self, how evil
soever he entreated her, she gave an outward show of thankful
contentmente, and when it was his pleasure to shutt her close in a chamber, as
a bird in the cage, she refused not his sentence, but embrasinge the gift of
her present fortune, took such consolation as the hard condition of her case
would admit, giuinge god thanks for his visitation, and crauinge with like
intercession to have her husband, restored to the use of his former wits:
Albeit all these dutiful shows of obedience, and pacient disgesting of his
unnatural discourtesies, together with a rare and ready disposition in her to
frame herself wholly to thappitit of his will, prevailed no more to enlarge
her liberty, or redeem her from the servile yoke of close ymprisonement, then
to reclayme his hagarde mind to thunderstandinge of reason, or restore the
trance of his frantique humor, raging the more (as it seamed) by the
incredible constancye he noted in this mirror of modesty, obedience, wisdom,
and chastetie, whose example, in them all deserves certeinlye to be graven in
pillars of eternetie, and honge up in tables of gold, in every palace and
place of estate, to the end that you ladies of our time, may learn by
ymitacion of her order and government, to atteine to the like perfection of
virtue, which she left as a special pattern to you all, to thend also that
if any of you by likemisfortune, do fall into the danger of semblable
accidents, you may learn here thorder of your government, in the like
affairs, and also to suppress ye rage of Ielowsie rather by virtue, then
force, which commonly is the foundation of skandale and slander, deuorcemente
and violacion of marriage, upon does consequently ensue civil discencio^s, and
utter subuer cio^ of houses of antiquity: but now to ye place of our history.

This frantique ALBANOYSE and Jealous captain, being one of the train of the
lord James TRIVOVLSE a great fauorer of the faction of GEBALYNO in Italye, and
at that time governor of the duchy of MILLAYNE under ye french king, LOYS
the third of that name, whether it were to make a further proffe, of the
patience of his wife, or by absence to mortefie and forgett, his fond opinion,
conceived without cause, retired upon a soddaine to Neweastel, ye court and
ordenarie place of abode, of ye said Lord TRYVOVLSE, which albeit was of hard
disgestion, to the lady for a time, yet being not unacquainted with such
chances, and no pren tise in the practice of her husband, retired to her
ancient patience, and contentment by force, dyssimuling with a new grief and
secret sorrow, this new discourtesie, to the end that her waspishe husband,
should take no excepcions to her in any respect, but find her in this, as the
former storms, bent wholly to obey thappetit of his will, and not to mislike
with that which he fyndes necessary to be don.

This TRIVOVLSE had not spente many months in france, but there was
commenced informacion against him to the king, that he was revolted from the
french, and become friend to the Swytzers, and sworn to their seigneurye and
faction, wherewyth ymediatelye fame the common (...) the common catyer of tales.

this further ^ddicion, that the king for that cause, had sent him headles to
his grave, albeit as fame is rather a messenger of lies, then a treasure of
truth and ra her to be hard, then believed, so this brute being not true in
the last, did ymporte a certain credit in the first for TRYVOVLSE not liking
to live in the displeasure of his prince, abandoned his charg, and came into
Lumbardy, where being sommoned by the messenger of death, gave place to nature
and dyed, who being the only master and meynteynor of the ALBANOYSE
captain whilst be lived, cold not casely be forgotten of him after his
death, for after his departure was past, the general doubt of the people, and
each voice resolved, that he was laid in his grave, Don Capitaino spado,
resolved whollye into tears, seamed here to pass, the mystery of a new
trance, which with the fresh remembrance of his ancient harm, and green
wound of unworthy Ielowsye, bledynge yet in his mind, brought him in that
case, that he neither desired to live, nor doubted to die, and yet in despair
of them both: his solace of the day was converted into tears, and the hours
of the night went away in vistons and hollow dreams, he loathed the company
of his friends, and hated the things that should sustain nature, neither was
he contented with the present, nor cared for the chance of future time, which
sudden alteracion in strange manner, drive his careful wife, into no less
astonishement then she had cause, and being ignorant of the occasion, she was
also void of consolation, which doubled her grief, till time opened her at
last a mean to communicate familiarly with him in this sort, Alas sir (says
she), to what end serve these pininge conceits, forcing a general debilytie
through al your parts? or why do you languishe in grief, without discoueryng
the cause of your sorrow, to such as hold your health no less dear then
the sweet and pleasant taste of their own life? from whence co^mes this often
change of complexion, accompanied with a disposition of malencolicke dompes
arguing your inward and fretting care of mind? why stay you not in time ye
source of your skorching sighs, that have alredye drayned your body of his
wholesome humors appointed by nature to give suck to thintrals and inward
parts of you? and to what end serves this whole river of tears, flowynge by
such abundance from your watery eyes almost worn away with weeping? is your
grief grown great by continuance of time, or have you conceived some mislike
of new? If your house be out of order in any sort, or that want of duty or
diligence in me procures your grudge, declare the cause, to the end the fault
may be reformed in me, and you restored to your au^cie^t order of quiet, and
we both enjoy a mutual tra^quillitie as apperteineth. But he that labored of
an other disease then is incide^t commonly to men of good government, absolved
her of all faults or other mislikes he found in the state of his house, or
other his affairs committed to her order, and less lack of her diligence to
make declaracion of her duty to thutermoste, but alas says he, with a deep
sighe derived of the ^retinge dolor of his mind, and doubled twice or thrice
within his stomach before he could utter it, what cause of comfort or
consolation has he to live in this world, from whom the malice of destenie
has taken the chiefeste pillor of his life, or to what end serves the
fruicion or interest of longer years in this vale of unquietness, when the body
abhors alredie the long date of his abode hear? or why should not this soma
or mass of corrupcion which I received of the world, be dismissed to earth,
and my soul have leave to pass into the other world, to shonne this double
passion of present torment which I feel by the death of my dear friend? Ah
my dear Lady and loyal wife, my grief is so great, that I dye to tell you
the cause, and yet the very remembrance presents me with treble torments,
wherein (I must confess unto you, that since the death of the late Lord Ihon
Tryuulso, I have had so little desyer to live, that all my felicity is in
thinking to die, neither can there be any thing in the world more acceptable to
me then death, whose hour and time, if they were as certain, as himself is
most sewer Albeit death is most certain, yet the hour and time of his
coming is not known.
to come in the end, I could somewhat satisfye the great desyer I have to
die, and moderate the rage of my passion in thinking of the shortness of the
dome that should give end to my dyeng ghost and unruly sorrows together?
besides waighing thin^inite miseries of our time, (accompanieng us eue^ from
the womb of concepcion) with the reaste and reapose which dead men do find,
And knowing withal how much I am in the debte of him that is dead, I can not
wish a more acceptable thing then the spedie approach and end of my days,
to the end that being denied the view of his presence here I may follow him in
the other world, where participating indiferently such good and evil as falls
to his share, I may witness with what duetiful zeal and affectioned heart I
sought to honor and serve him in all respects. But the Lady that saw as
far into the disease of her husband, as his phizicion into his vryne,
knowing well enoughe that he did not languishe so much for the desyer of him
that was dead, as the ticklishe humor of Ielowsye troubled him, was content to
admit his coollours (how fine so ever they were) as well to prefer her duty
to thuttermoste, as also to avoid imputacion or cause of suspicion on her
part, wherewith entering into terms of persuacion, she added also this kind of
consolacion folowinge.

seame to take of your self, then the terms of your disease do trouble me,
consideringe the same procedes of so slender occasion, that the very
remembrance of so great an oversight, ought to remove the force and cause of
your accident: admit your grief were great indeed, and your disease of no
less importance, yet ought you so to bridle this wilful rage and desyere to
dye, that in eschewing to prevent the will and set hour of the Lord, you seek
not to further your fatal end by using unnatural force against your self,
making your beastly will the blodye sacrifize of your body, whereby you shall be
sewer to leave to the remeinder of your house, a crown of infamy in the
judgment of the world to come, and put your soul in hazard of grace before
the troane of justice above, you know (sir) I am sewer that in this
transitorye and paineful pilgrimage, there is nothing more certain then death,

I will not live to lament the loss of my second husband, nor use other dule in

semblable end of your dear and loving wife, whose simple and frank offer
here (opening a most convenient occasion for her wylfull husband to disclose
the true cause of his disease) prevailed so much over his doubtefull and
waueringe mind, that dismissing even then his former dissimulacion, he
embraced her, not without such abundance of tears and unruly sighs, that for
the time they took away the use of his tongue. Albeit being delivered of his
trau^ce, and restored to the benefit of his speech, he disclosed unto her the
true cause and circumstaunce of his grief in this forte.

Albeit since the time of my sickness (says he) you have seen what distress

of so race a passion, wherein also your continual presence and ^iewe of my
weak state is sufficientlye hable to record the whole discourse of my
disease, yet are you neither partaker of my pain, nor priuye to the principal
causes of so strange an evil, neither have I been so hardy to discover them
unto you because I have been hitherto doubtful of that, whereof your last
words have fullye absolved me. And now, being weakened with the wearines of
time and sickness, in such sort, as nature has ridd her hands of me, and
given me over to the order of death, who is to spare me no longer, but to utter
these last words unto you, I account it a special felicity in my hard
fortune, that in thoppenyng of the true causes of my gre^e, I may cloase and
seal up the last and extreme term of my life. And because I will clear in
few words the mystery which seames to amaze you. You shall note that there be
iij. only ministers and occasyons of my disease, whereof the first, (and of
least importance) is for the death of my late Lord and master, Don Ihon
tryuoulso whereof you are not ignorant, the second (exceeding the first in
greatness of grefe and force against me) is to think that the rigor of my
destinies, and violence of sickness, yeldynge me into the hands of death, will
dissolve and break by that means, the league of long and loyal love which
from the beginnynge my heart has vowed unto you, but the third and last, (of
a more strange quality then either of the rest) is to think that when I am
dead, and by time worn out of your mind, an other shall enjoy the sweet and
pleasant benefit of that divine beauty of yours, which ought to serve but
for the diet of the gods, the simple view whereof seames hable (if it were
possible) to make me sufferye martiredom of ij. deaths, whereunto she replied with
persuacions to drive him from his fond devise, profering her self eftesones

closset or chamber of secrets, his erraund in deed being to fetch his dagger,
which (without making her priuye) he conveyed under the bolster of his bed,
beginnynge even then to prefer a preamble before the part he meant to play,
for fallinge from his former complaints of sickness, he retired into terms of
extreme ^ren^zy and madness, brainge out such groans and sighs of hideus
disposicion, with owlyng, cryeng, and foaminge at the mouth, like one possessed
with an evil sprit, that who had seen his often change of coollor and
complexion in his face, his ghastly regardes arguinge ententes of desperacion,
and his eyes (slaming with fury,) so^ke into his head, with the order of his
passion every way, might easily have judged the desyer of his heart to be of no
small importance, and the thing he went about neither common nor commendable,
wherein he was assisted with.iij. enemies of diverse disposicions, love,
Jealousy, and death, the least of the which is sufficient of him self to make
a man chafe in his harneys, and take away the courage of his heart in the
midst of the combat, for the one presented a certain fear by reason of the
horror of the act, the other sewed (as it were) for an abstinence, or at
least amoderacio^ of ye cruelty he had co^menced against his innocent wif, but
ye third, being ye beginner of al, and exceeding the rest in power, would not
dismiss him from the stage till he had played thuttermost act of his malicious
tragedy.

Mark here (good Ladies) the desolation of this unfortunate Gentlewoman, and

certeinlye you have no less reason to help to bewail her wretched chance,
then just occasion to join in general exclamation, against the detestable
act of her tyrannous husband, who disclayminge even now his former state and
condition of a man, retires into thabite of a monster, and cruel enemy to
nature, and in conuertinge the virtue of his former love and remembrance of the
sondrie pleasures he had heretofore received of his dear and loving wife,
into present rage and unnatural furye, far exceeding the savage and brutishe
manner of the Tiger, Lion, or Libards, bredd in the deserts of affrike the
common Norsse of monsters, and creatures cruel without reason, whettyng his

saluted her with ten or.xij. estockados, one in the neck of an other in
diverse parts of her body, renewynge the confilict with no less number of
blows in her head and arms, and because no part should escape free from the
stroke of his malice, he visyted her white and tender legs, with no less
rage and furye then the rest, wherewith beholdinge in her diverse undoubted
arguments of death, began the like war with himself, vsinge the same mean
and ministers with his own hands, enbrewed yet with the blood of his
innocent wife, she wyng (notwithstanding this horrible part and act of
despair) diverse and sondrye signs of special gladness and pleasure in his
face, wherein he continued till the last and extreme gasp of life, chiefly
for that he saw him accompanied to death with her, whom he was not hable to
leave behind him on live, and who (being ouercharged as you have hard) with
the number of wounds, the violence whereof, (preuailinge far above the
resistance of life) did press her so much with the hasty approach of death
that the want of breath abridged her secret shryft and confession to god, with
less leisure to yield her innocent soul (with humble prayer) into the hands
of her redemer, and commend the forgeuenes of her sins to the benefit of his
mercy. Only she had respyte (with great a do to speak) to give order that her
body might be laid in the tomb of her first husband SIGNEVR BARZO.

But the cursed and execrable ALBANOYS (so wholly possessed with the devil,
that the gift of grace was denied him) abhorred to the last mynute of his
life, the remembrance of repentance, for laughinge (as it were) at the fowlenes
of the fact even until life left him senceles and void of breathe, he
commended his carkes to the gredie Jaws of ravenous wolves, serving also as a
fyt pray for ye venomous serpents and other crepinge worms of the earth,
and his soul to the reprobate socyetie of Judas and Cayne with other of
thinfernall crewe.

The worthy end of this wicked wretch, argues the just reward of the
evil disposed, and such as are vnhaypelie dropped out of the favor of god,
the ordenarye success of those enterprises, that are beg^n without the
consent of wisdom or raison, but chiefly theffectes and fortune of such as
(blinded with the veil of their own will) and dymned with the mist of follye, do
reapose so much for them selves in the opinion of their own wit, that
detestinge good council and thaduise of the wise, do credit only the
conceit of their own fancy, which (as a blind guide) does lead them into
infynit miseries and laborinth of endless annoye, where there is no dispense of
their folly, but loss of liberty, perpetual infamy, and sometime
punishemente by untimely death, which as they be worthy rewards, for such
as dote so much in their own wisdom, that they account the same hable of it
self, to comprehend the whole globe, or compass the world, So the wise man
affore he enters into any enterprise of weight (being careful for the
conueighe of the same) does not only compare the end with the beginning, and
cast the sequiel and circumstance every way, but also entringe (as it were)
into himself, he makes a view of that which is in him, and for his better
assistance, he will not refuce the advice of his friends, by which means he is
sewer to reap the reward of his travel with treble contentmente, and seldom
is he punished with to late a repentance: Herewith also thexample of the wise

wythstande the malice of danger by kepinge the channel, which yeldes him

his forces, before he became subject to ye humor of Ialouse suspicion, or if he
had given correction to his falte in time, and suffered reason to suppress the
rage of his folly, before he was grown to terms of madness, he had enjoyed
his Lady at pleasure, lived yet in quiet, and prevented the foul note of
infamy, wherewith the gates and posternes of his house will be painted, till
thextreme date of the world, and eschewed the peril of dampnable despair

participat with such passion, for a familiar testymonie whereof, I have
preferred this history following, not only affirminge my former protestacion
touching the disordinat effects of love, but also to iustefye the opynion of

SONDRYE PERILS, happeninge to a young gentleman of Myllanin the poursewte of
his Lady
NOt long after MAXYMILIANS FORCE by the guide of evil fortune, and want of
good gouernmente in himself, had lost the state and seigneurye of MILLAN
there happened no less desolation to the unhappy faction of the GEBELYNS,
who^ the power and pollecie of the great TRIVOLSO did not only abandon their
natural soil and place of a bode, dryuinge them from the possession of their
worldly porcions, but also persecuted their wretched state with such
creweltie, that they were ready to yield to the somonce of dispare, if it had
not been for the simple proffer of a certain hope, they reaposed in
thassistance of themprour MAXIMILIAN, who more willing then hable to restore
their desolation, pursewed the revenge of their wrong with a puissant army
even until the walls and gates of MILLAN: where he received such hot
repulses by the valyaunte encounters of Charles Duke of Burbon (then viceroye
or deputy to the french king) that paintynge the gates with the blod of his
capteines, and leaving the dead bodies of his people in witness of his being
there, the majesty returned with more commendacion for his good meaning,
then fame or glory of the victory, leauyng the miserable s^radyates (bathed
in the tears of their second sorrow) to the guide and gouernemente of their
fortune, who seamed at last to enter into such compassion of their misery,
that she restored the greateste part not only to the liberty of their
country and society of former habytacion, but also to choose of their goods
and revenues usurped by the enemy: the rest she divided into diverse corners
of christendom, some went to Trent and were sworn the subjects of Francis
Sforce Duke of Bary, other found place of abode in the kingdom of Naples, to
some she gave passeporte to attempt the devotion of the wholly vicar of rome,
and the rest repaired to MANTVA: amongst which ^^ewe or last company, was one
CORNELIO (upon whom this history makes his chiefest discourse) whom albeit
fortune had made partaker of her malice amongst the rest of his contreymen,
yet his mind grudging with thiniurye of fate, lost nothing of her entyer and
virtue, for notwithstanding he was of the race of the SFORCIANS, and chiefest
enemy to the usurped government and proud behauior of the frenchemen within
MILLAN, and that he had left amongeste them his inheritance and goods to
confiscacion, yet was he assisted with so fine a pollecye and great endeavor of
his mother, that he had sufficient exhibicion to meinteyne his ancient port
and calling.

And as the stately view and feyture of his complexion and lyms, presented a
special conninge of nature, lacking besides no gift or quality due to a
gentleman and pestered wythall with no more years then were conueniente for the
decoracion of so seamely a beauty: So being the chief courtier that hawnted
the company of Ladies, and no less welcome amongst the lostie dames of
MILLAN before the subuercion of their society by the cruelty of the
frenchemen, he made a choice of one from amongeste the rest, whom he failed
not to court with a contynual proffer of his service and other offices of
humanity prescrybed in the skole of love, until he thought himself
sufficientlye rampierd in the intralls of her heart, and left her no less
willinge to yield a perticipacion of affection, then himself passioned with
desyer to pursewe the quest and conquer her beauty, her name was PLAVDINA
equal to him in the height of estate, and nothing inferior in the golden
gifts and ornaments of nature? And albeit she had newly made a proof of the
married man's pastyme, and offered the flower and first fruits of her vir gynitie
upon thalter of wedlock: yet the youngnes of her years (defending her beauty
from al arguments of alteracion or cha^ng) would not suffer the hot and often
encounters of her husband, to ympaire any way the glass or precious dye of
so rare a perfection: wherein as she was noted ye odd peragon of Italy as well
for that respect, as other ornaments of majesty incydente to honor: So the
commendacion of these virtues seamed not so fyt an instrument to advance her
fame and glory, as present means to procure treble passion to the new
disquiet of CORNELIO, who grieved not so much with the sentence of adversity,
as cried out of the Law of nature and malice of his present fortune, for that
the one had given him a heart to love, and liberty to choose, and the other
being his guide in the toil and travel of his suit, took him away when he
attended to reap the fruits of his harueste, but that which brought more
oyleto his match, and kindled the coals of fresh disquiett was, that albeit
he knew him self to be reciprocallie loved, or at least nere the good will
of his lady, yet was he void of means and mynisters to solicit his cause,
or bewraie that which he durst not discover, other then thamarous regardes
and glaunces of the eye, with certain sighs and secret wringing of the hand,
and Secret solicitors of the inward affection of the heart.
kisses gotten by stealthe in corners, which albeit argued a likelihod and
SIMPATHYA of affection, ympartinge an equality of desyer to the hearts of
them both, yet the one being affraied to give the charge, and the other
ashamed to resign without any alaram, seamed both plonged indifferentlye in a
passion of doubt and fear, until love (whose affairs can not well be
dispatched without thassistance of a third) quarellinge with the simplicitye
of Cornelio, presented him with a messenger conueniente for the conueighe of
their buysines: for there was a pore Swain, sometime serving as a drudge to
the mother of CORNELIO, and now preferred to his Lady PLAVDINA in the rowmthe
of her wagyner or coache dryuer, whose office as it was always to go by the
doare of her coache when her pleasure was to ^isyt places of solace, and take
open air in the feldes, so reaposinge much for himself in the fidelity of
his slave, thinking to enjoin a greater credit to thauthorytie of his small
office, admitted him in his heart the aptest coll carier between him and his
Lady: wherefore after he had contured him by fear and fair promises to
ad^owe his diligence to ^huttermoste, with no less secrecye, then wisdom, and
convenient expedicion at al times, he made a first proof of his pollecie and
fine conueighe of his charge, in the delyuerye of a letter, which be willed
him to present unto PLAVDINA, thinward affection and disposition of whose
heart, as he measured by the messages of her eyes, so he preferred his service
and boarded her good will with these terms: If it were not good Cornelio
vvriteth to plaudyna
madam that every state and condition of man, were subject to his peculyar
desaster, and that the noble heart (made of a delicat metal) is more full of
affections and apt to encl^yne to the loare of love, then the rest of the rude
and harbarous people, I would think that the passion which pinchethe such
as do love, were a skourge and due correction sent from above, for a
chastismente of their lostye and wanton ymagynacions, but saying it is most
sewer that nature has put a certain difference between the dispositions of
her creatures, with a desire to pursewe the sommonce of her instigacion
according to the privilege of their degree, it is not in our power to
disclaim thinstructions of such a guide, nor degenerat from thinstinct of that
destenie given us in our conception, wherein as the noble mind loathinge the
enterprise of base or vile condition, delites in such conquestes as yield most
fame or commendacion, So you ought not to marvel, if the glymeringe beams
of your rare beauty, painted by divine art in the forefronte of your face, the
adoracion which all men yield to your singler virtues, with other semely
perfections and gifts of majesty given you by the heavens for a dowry above
the rest, have made me strike sail of my former liberty, with frank
resignacion of my heart and dearest part in me, to the disposicion of your
mercy, neither have I any cause at all to mislike the sentence of my fate, or
grudge with the lot of my present choice, if the respect of my unfeigned love
and sincere loyaltye, may move you to pay the tribute of my service, with an
assurance of semblable affection, wherein because both danger and distaunce
of our abodes (denienge the tongue to do his office) barreth us also to use the
benefytt of mutual conference, I humbly crave (good The eyes be the secret
signs and mesengers of love.
Madam) an absolute resolution by your letters, of that which the secret signs
and messengers of love, do not only put me in hope, but importes a warrantie of
the conquest of your good will, wherein if I may be assisted with the goodness
of the heavens, and consent of fortune so farfurth, as the same may make me
meritorious of your favor, and that the meritt of my service may be measured
with a grant of your good will, there shall no peril withstand the proffer of
my life to do you pleasure, nor any occasion or chance whether it be
accidental or proper, have power to break the vow which my heart has alredie
sworn to dye and live in the service and contemplacion of your beauty,
neither shall any Lady in this corner of the world, have more cause to joy in
the choice of her servant, then the Peragon Plaudina, whose hand I kiss with
great humilitye, and honor the remembrance of her name, with no less
sincerity being absent, then desyerous to yield my homage with due adoracion
to the presence of so fair a creature. Yours more then his own. Cornelyo.

The Lady being darted before with the desyer of Cornelio, and would gladly have
entered the listes and given the onset, if it had not been for the respect of
her honor, was now so wounded to the quick, that she fell into terms of
comme^dacion of her chance, blissynge the goodness of her fortune, that had not
only planted her affection in so high a place, but (yeldynge her reward with
semblable glee) has made her the mystres of him, whom her heart had alredye
chosen and admitted into undoubted favor, which she confirmed eftesones with
such terms of gratulation and arguments of present gladness, that if the
remorce of shame and reputacion of her honor, had not been impedimentes to
the desyer of her heart, cloasinge her mouth against the present conceytes of
joy in this new society, she had immediatlye dismissed the messenger, with
absolute assurance to perform the request of him that sent him: whereof albeit
shame seamed to abridge the expedicion, and offer causes of stay for the time,
yet wantynge force to mortifye altogether the humor of ragyng desyer, the was
driven to give place to the provocation of love, who deuestinge her of honest
shamfastnes, which ought to be the chief habit and decoracion of the
beauty of great Ladies, willed her to defer no longer the thing she had
alredye vowed, and seeing ye injury of present time, denied her to satisfye
him as she would, at least to yield him such contentement as she may:
wherefore taking pen, ynke and paper, she replied to his letter with this
answer.

argue an excepcion against the friendly looks and glaunces of mine eyes,
wherein albeit I could note a great simplicity and want of discrecion in him,
that constreth the regardes of a Lady (cast at unawares) to the commoditye of
himself in wynninge the good will of her that means nothing less, then to
make them the Ministers of love: yet being more ready to content you therein,
then curious of mine own behavior, I am to acquit you of imputacion that
way, and convert ye note of ye folly to the oversight of my self. And albeit
the pleasant encounter of mine eyes, seaming more liberal on your behalf, with a
familiarity more the^ ordinary to al men, may persuade a certain difference I
have put between the friendship of you and respect of any other, with desyer to
embrace you above any one creature. Yet was I of opinion that your sondrye
virtues and reputation of honor, would not suffer you to challenge me for the
first fault, or to convert these regardes of simple and cold favor into
such consequence, as to attempt the violation of that, which mine honor
grudgeth to lose, and the vow of faith to my husband forbiddes me to depart
withal: notwithstanding I yield you no less thanks for your curtesye then
you seame to give commendacion to my beautye and other gifts you note in me,
accomptinge the same of greater price, by the value and estimacion you make of
them, neither will I refuse ye proffer of your present friendship, which, (as I
hope) is void of intent to prejudice mine honor, so let it suffice you that I
am not only contented to admit you into favor, but also determined to hold you
no less dear then the tendrest part of my self. And because letters (being
incident to many casualties) are commonly the first discloasers of the
secrets of lovers, my advise is, that hensfurth you stay not only the
diligence of your pen, in sealing such great importance within a dissemblyng
piece of paper, but also be contented to commit the whole conueighe of our
business to the credit of this bringer, who is to yield you salutacion on the

The report of this letter preferred such a possibility and likelihode of good
luck to the Myllanoys, that dismissing even now al arguments of former doubt,
he determined to accept the offer of his fortune and pursue ye benefit of
present time, wherein he was so furthered by the diligence of the minister and
messenger of their love, that theare seamed to want (for the fynall complote of
their busynes) but only the consent of convenient time and place, which had
followed accordingly, if for the more assurance of the bargain they had bry^ed

self, as ready to manifest her mutabilitie, when the wretches of the world
seame to reapose mest assurance in her friendship. And as the pleasant apple
mustering with delicate glee upon the heyght of the highest spraise, is blown
down, with the least poffe of wind that breathes, and so oppressed with the
violence of the fall, that the fruts is quyte taken away in the midst of his
glory, so the case and quiet of man, is favored with so small a moment of time,
and subject to so many chaunges, that we ought neither esteem (so greatly as
we do) the tikle pleasures of so small abode, nor judge assurance in such
uncertain vanities, seeing withal the same is of such malicious disposicion,
that when we have laid the fundation of our pleasure and prosperity, with
full perfuacion to enjoy our quiet without controllement it is then that
fortune discovers her ambushs, and inuaoynge us at unawares with the furye of
her malice, paieth our former pleasure with an interest of treble desolacion,
that fails not to attend us even until our fatal days of reapose, whereof
you may note a familyar proffe in the sequeile of this CORNELIO, who being
upon the point to taste of the delicat fruits in love, and embrace his Lady
with such contentement as lovers do commonly wish, and seldom encounter,
behold the malice of the French men began to rage with such extremity
against the lynage of the SFORCIANS, whereof he was one of the chiefest) that
he was driven to avoid the present danger of his lyse, with a soddaine
fleight and secret stealing out of the town, wherein he was so hoatlye
puriued with thextremitye of his peril, that being barred any leisure to
communicate with his dearest friends, and less time to impart his mish ap to
his lady, or once salute her with a simple farewell, which seamed not so
grievous to himself, as of treble-dolour to the sorrowful PLAVDINA, who
distillynge no small number, of tears on the behalf of the soddain departure
and absence of her dear friend, and restored at last to a moderation and
patience by force, began to cast the circumstaunce of his danger, wherein the
ymagined all such doubts as either hope or fear could put in her head,
sometime persuadynge, he should be overtaken and oppressed by the way, and by
and by she feared least he were betrayed into the hands of his enemies, by
the malice of such as he put intruste with his life, wherein she was no less
doubteful of the one, then in despair of the other, and in such perplexity with
the conceit of them both, that she seamed no less passioned for the time,
then if the enemies of her friend had cut her CORNELIO in pieces before her face.
And as she molde have dismissed these tragical conceits of doubt and fear,
and retired to a quiet, with exspectation of better fortune, she was suddenly
assailed. with a second alarame in her heart, which mortifyenge all care of the
well doing of her absent CORNELIO, preferred a vehement desyer not only to
recover him (wherein appcared a great impossibilitye) but also wishinge to be
a companyon of his journey, and partaker of his miserye, she seamed to expose a
frank of that which earste she was ash amed and made conscience to grant,
and as she was void of al comfort The (...) her body.
in this calamitys, sauinge that the often remembrance of her friend, seamed to
restore some little contentement, so ymagininge that the breath of the air
would carry the Echo of her complaints into the ears of him that was gone, she
saluted his absence with these terms.

we find in miserye, is to record the circunstaunce of our misfortune,
neither can that grief be of great importance, whose cause is of small moment,
but alas what sorrow is semblable to the separacion of friends? Ah CORNELIO what
ancient grudge procures this new mislike, or what offense have I don of
late, that makes me meritorious of this great discurtesye? Will thou pay the
merit of my frendshypp with so unthankful a trybute, and abuse therspeaarion
which all men had of thy virtue? haste thou plied me to thappetit of thy will,
and no we determined to leave me in the greatest distress of desyer to enjoy
thee? or can thou use so small regard to the desolate state of the sorrowful
PLAVDINA, as leaving her hathed in the tears of vnderserued dule, to steal
away, with out the comfort of one simple adieu? What nedest thou have doubted
to commununicate with her, who has always reserved an equal care of thy
sauetye, and her own life? And if the love thou haste vaunted to bear me, had
been matched with an unfeigned meaning of continuance and constancy, the fear
of the enemy had not prevented thy coming to me, for love alas defyeth the
malice of danger, and peril is the thing that least troubles the heart that
is truly affectionate: Love estemeth no danger.
What comfort in my present misery, or exspectation of future redress, being
out of hope eftesones to reclaim him, that received but now the sentence of
continual exile? How am I plunged in a passion of double extremetie, meyther
content to disclayme my affection, and less hable to dismiss the remembrance
of him that is the cause of my woe? I find now (alas to soon.) How iustelye
we women mave exclayme against nature, who framynge us of a brickle moulde
apt to yield, and easy to be won, has enjoined us withal a certain
vehemency of affection, pearsynge the heart with desyer in such sort, as
being once thorowlye coyffed with love, we are not only forsaken, when we
wish thieflye to embrace the object of our appetit, but also are subject to
abide all sorts of revenge of the ordinarye rigor of men. And what rigouro?
wrong have I offered the Dh CORNELIO whereof I have not felt the first
apprehencion? For forcyng my self to yield the contentement, I spared not the
proffer of mine honor to purchasse thy frendshipp, and in gyuynge the
assurance of my good will, I have spotted the renown of my former reputacion,
whereof the blood of shame puttes me in remembrance with grudge at so great
a fault, and thy conscience is my present witness of my unfeigned loyaltye:
neither will the flatteryng lines of thy sondrie letters conceile this
discurtesye, nor the messenger and faithful solicitour of our love, forgett
to reproach the of inconstant behauyour to thy loyal PLAVDINA, who feelynge
now what it is to lack the societye of him, whom the heart has chosen to
love, is equally pinched with the panges of such as plunged in the passion of
desyer, do wyshe that they want, and lack the thing they chieflye would
have, whereby they seame to norishe life with the only breathe of a simple and
cold hope. But why am I so pertiall on mine own behalf, in exclaimyng
against the discurtesye of him, who peradventure deserves not these terms
of blame? or why do I not rather respect the true cause of his departure,
sturred up (as it seameth) by the necessitye of the time, forcinge him to
habandon his parents, countreye and revenue, onles he would quench the
thirste of his enemies, with the abundance of his blood, and appease their
malice with the price of his head, certeinlye the virtues and gifts of
CORNELIO acquit him of all arguments of inconstancy neither can a body of
so rare perfection harbor such dyssemblynge disposicion. But as the desyerous
heart is seldom at rest, The desyerous heart is seldom at rest and doubtefull
minds dreede alvvayes deceit.
so the doubtefull mind is dreadefull of deceit, and quareliynge continuallye
with his good hap or synister fortune, is always in ymaginacion what judgment
to resolve upon the condition of his own estate, so my case is of no less
perpleritie, for wafting indifferently between happy chance, and evil
success, I feel my self double passioned, sometime moved to rejoice my good
hap, in being loved of so honest curteouse, and noble a gentleman as Cornelio,
and by and by driven to inueighe against my evil fortune, that has put such
distance and seperacion of our bodies when we wear at point to perform the
consommacion of our acquaintance. And albeit the common chances of this
world resemble a confection made of honey and gall, and that the banquettes of
love, being garnished with dishes of both sorts, will us to make choice with
deliberacion, alledgynge that the pleasure is not so great, as the repentance
and penance of hard disgestion, yet I think the virtue to perform the vow
of the heart, takes away the greatness and heinous disposicion of the fault,
wherefore seeing my heart has made his choice, and the rest of my parts
resolved to perform the quest, I will not only dismiss all doubts of the
assurance of his good will, but study to excede him in affection, deuisinge
the means from hensfurth, to make him feel the force of my goodwill, with the
desyer I have to knitt an indissoluble unity of the ij. minds, whose bodies
are forced to live in seperacion by the malice of the world, and angry dome
of our fortune.

Here if PLAVDINA inueighed only upon ij. points of her desaster, the one for
the soddaine departure of her friend and the other for the doubt she seamed to
put in the assurance of his love, it is to be thought that CORNELIO had
cause of treble complaint, both to be driven to save his life by cowardlye
flighte, to steal away in such secret and scilent manner, as only his guide
was pryuie to his goinge, and also to be distressed with such shortness of
time, that he was barred to seame thankeful to his Lady with a simple farewell,
which was sufficient to stir up her Ielous humor against him, but that
which exceded the rest in greatness of greef, was that he had no man of trust
to carye her news of his being, and much less durst he communicate his
buysynes with any stranger, neither had he hope to be advertised of the
accurrantes of MYLLAN, nor mean to make reaport of his own estate at MANTVA,
for that he durst not discover the place of his present abode there, wherefore
cryeng out of the constellation and clymat of his destynies, he complained his
unhappy case in this sort

my falte meet to be dispensed withal, or if I had as iustlye deserved this
wrong, as I am sewer to suffer the smarte, I had no reason to commence cause
of complaint against the malice of ye world, and much less accuse the
iniquitye of present time, nor yet cry out of ye synister disposition of
fortune, to whom as the poets seame to attribute some power over our worldly
affairs (bestowinge their endeavor therein I think) rather to feed the time
and ymagynacions of the people, with a shape or figure of an inconstant
creature, then with intent to persuade a credit in so senceles an image: so I
am also persuaded by the present experience of her inconstancy, that she is
not so liberal to give, as ready to take away, a less hable to continue the
felicity wherwyth she seames to flatter ye conceit of ye simple, for who^ she
has brought to believe in her, she makes manytimes more desirous of glory then

mobylitie, the^ ye unhappy CORNELIO, who^ (being favored with ye offer of a
reciprocal affection, and at the point to be put in the possession of his

both the one and the other are subject to confucion, and ready to yield at
the least poffe of wind that blows from a contrary shore. Yet if I were a
simple cytisen or companion of meaner calling, thennemie would neither watch
my doings with so many eyes, nor pursewe my death by public or pryuate
inuacion, and I suffered to live as free from the troubles and tumultes of the
world, as far from any care or account of the doings of great men, where

shall make absolute declaracion of the unfeigned constancy of my mind, with the
sincere vow of loyalty, which I have sworn and dedicated to the service of
her deuyne beauty, even until the last and extreme seperacion of my soul and

to admit any consolation, and that the goodwill of fortune, comes rather at
unawares, then won by special suit, I will perforce content my self with the

moderation of the hardness of my exile, so honor thymage and picture of her

those kind of tortles or domestical fools, degeneratinge from the planet
that governs thinclynacion of true lovers, whose complexion ought not to be
dymmed with the darkness of desolate places, do seame to have their consepcion
from under the angrye and crabbed constellacion of SATVRNE, wishinge willingly
that their Ladies were converted into the shape of Nymphs, whom the poets
feign to wander and dwell in the thickest covert of the woddes, to the end that

Cornelio, who visiting the assemblies and metings of the Ladies of MANTVA was
marked ymediatly of one of the chiefest Ladies of the City, and regarded with
so good an eye, that fallinge extremely in love with the virtues and other
dexterities of the banished knight, she embraced him so straitelye in the
intrals of her heart, that upon thinstante she had forgot the honor and
reputacion of her state, with the veil of shame, (which ought to soole the
eyes of great Ladies, and correct the humor of their fond appetit) in
executing thoffice of a shameful clyent, in a cause, which she neither ought
to have solicited, and much less condiscended unto by force of any
ymportunities how great soever they were, if it had not been for thassistance
of an old neighbor of hers who understanding the disease of her mistrys,
promised her diligence to procure the remedy with expedicion, wherein she
omitted no oportunitye as occasion was given, for attendinge the offer of

greatest thing (Sir) that makes a valyante man known to the world, and

and offer of his fortune, given him for thincrease of his felicity, neither
can any man more abuse thexcellente gifts and goodness of nature, then to
contemn thinstinct and pryuiledge which she has given him for the
decoracion of his estate. The gentleman somewhat astonished with the soddayne
encounter of his neighbor, seamed to marvel no less at the retorike of
tholde MARMOTTA, then muse what might be the intent of such formal
protestacion, where with for his part, having no great leisure to devise for
his answer, cold not reply but with terms of curtesye in this sort. If at

offended the ears of you or any other, or by like over sight have don that
which your disposition can not brook, nor the Law of curtesye allow with the
consent of your opynion, I am rather to be pardoned by course, then punished
by justice, for that such offenses being common and natural, seame rather to
proceed of ignorance, then of thinstigacion of malice, or corruption of the
mind, wherein as your judgment is no less equal then my innocencye
meritorious, so if it will please you to reveal the chief points of my
falte, you shall see the hardenes of the pennaunce, with treble satisfaction of
the wrong, shall take away the foulnes of the fact: which kind of curteys
reply liked not a little the ears of the messenger, who accomptinge him
worthy to enjoy the good will of the greatest Lady of a country, gave
judgment of the victory with end of thenterprice, wherein notwithstanding she
was no less deceived, then shame, with the respect of her calling ought to
have cloased her mouth, from solycitinge so badd a case: for albeit she
discovered point by point, the cause of her cominge, with a peculyar
commendacion and praise of the Lady that sent her, forgettinge not to decypher
artyfyciallie her sondrye properties and many gifts of nature, but chiefly
her unfeigned affection, with ready offer and conformetie of that, whereof Law
of kind makes all men not only desierous, but study to win by long suit and
serviceable diligence, yet wantinge force to shake the walls of so sewer a
fortress, her art seamed also insufficie^t to persuade the mind of CORNELIO,
who albeit was of opynion and knew well enough, that the wisdom was no less
in acceptinge thoffer of a good adventure, then the folly of doble moment to
refuce the preferment of fortune, yet was he so wholly resolved in the loyal
love of his Lady at MILLAN, whose only and simple remembrance, restored such
a remorce of the vow which his heart had alredie sworn on her behalf, that
he seamed more willinge to embrace the last and fatal dome of his life, then
desyerous to abuse the least point of his duty and service unto her, And
albeit the desyers we feel stir in us, ymporte no other thing then a
certain mirror or lokinge glass receiuinge the dark ympressions which our
appetites present unto us, and that they which ymagyn whole castells of
constancy, with protestacion never to fainte in the vow they have made, do no
other thing then give occasion to writars to bewtyfye their histories with
the circumstance of their folly, with such a blow and open mockerye in the
end, that they stick not to discribe their vain and fond humor upon
public stage, in the hearing of all the world, yet am I of opynion, that as
the garmente that is fyt for every man, is well framed for no man, so the heart
that is as apt to declyne as the appetit is ready to sommon, is neither
meritorious of favor in any sort, nor meet to keep place in the rank of the
virtues, chieflye where he refuses thobiecte of his own choice, neither is
it possible that two sons give light to ye world at one instante, nor once
conueniente for the mind of one man, to embrace thymage or figure of more then
one saint, wherein thexample of CORNELIO, calling us to thymytacion of the
like virtue, serves also to confute thopposicions of certain covetous Ladies
now a days, who rather gredie of glory, then hable to deserve it, do not
stick to whet their wits and inueighe synisterly against thinconstancie of
men, transporting the whole title and honor of true loyalty to themselves, as
though there remained no spark nor show of that virtue in the hearts of men,
who as they were the first partakers of that gift, so the constante order of

which we deserve by just title, do seame to bewtifye theimselues with the
merit of other men's virtues: But because the ears of al women can not brook
the hearing of a troth and that the pursewte of this quarrel, (arguinge a
more danger in thaduenture, then gain in the victory) might set abroache
the faltes of some of our contreywomen, I am content to give them that they
will have by force, and retiringe to the place of my history, declare unto you
the answer of CORNELIO to the messenger. I am sorye (says Cornelyo
aunsvverethe the baude.
he) the large honor and liberal offer which you seame to present unto me on
the behalf of your Lady and mystrys, is of a more high momente, then either
I am worthys to possess, or hable to requite with equal merit, wherein
because the hard condition of my present state, seames my chiefeste enemy to
so great a prefermente, I doubt how to seame thankful to her, and
satisfye the time both together, albeit as things ympossible are not to be
pursewed, and offenses forced of necessity are most meritorious of pardon, so
being not hable to answer her exspectacion in counterchaunge of affection, I
am only to rack the little tallent that is left me to so high a pyn, that
only she shall dispose of my honor and life with all that I have in the
world at her pleasure, which it may like her to use as a supply of ye
present duty and service she demaundes at my hand, only being at this
present not the master of my self, nor the use of my heart in mine own
possession, my suit is that she rather blame the wrong which time offreth to
us both, then note me of any disdain in refusing the frendshippe of her, who
merits more then I am hable to perform: for if my heart were as free from
foreign and former bonds, as she deserves to be served, and that my
affections did not excede thordenary ympressions which assail the mind of
man, assure your self she should not live long vnsatysfyed to her
contentmente, and much less have cause to enter into suspection of Ieleous
disdain in me, for retorning the offer of that which may serve for a present
to the greatest prince in ITALY: neither will I so much abuse the proffer of
her acquaintance, or cause of your coming, as either her liberal offer, or
veheme^cie of your importunities on her behalf, shall move me to resolve a
worseopynion or more sle^der credyt on ye honor or honesty of her yt sent
you, desyeringe you for end to prefer my excuse according to thintegretie of
the same, with this further addicion and humble request, that she be as bold
to employe me in any other respect, no less amplye and so far furthe, as my
honor and life will extend: more honestly (says the messenger) cold you
not refuce the offer of that which earste was never presented to any, and
much less so near the point to make a price of so precious amarchandise,
neither do I think you worthy of the title of that courtesye, whereof you are
commended, nor yet am I of mind that your heart is capable of the noble
virtue of love, seeing ye renown and honor of her, whose bewty only has the
greatest princes of Italye in awe, can make no breach nor enter. And who
would seame of so slender judgment (unless he had quite disclaimed the
order of reason) that being proffered frelie that, which princes can not get
by any suit, and not only desired, but pursewed with great instance, would
let slip the gift of so good a fortune, and make chippes of the frendshippe
of so fair and curteons a Lady: with what face dare you visyt hereafter th
assemblies of great dames, having committed so great a falte on the behalf
of her, whose goodwill you do not deserve, if her curtesye did not call you to
that preferme^t? are you of opynion that the merit of your beauty and other
proporcion, excedes the honor and heighte of her that woeth you? ymagyn the
same to be of such force, that it is hable to draw Ladies to doat of you
even unto death, would you become so hard hearted as to increase your glory,
with thexployt of so great a cruelty? If you be subject to so fond an
humor, you must needs be incydente to the just revenge which the god of love
is ready to thonder upon such as seame to hold his loare in skornful
contempt, whereof as I have hard mo examples, then my skill is hable to
reueile in good order, being never trained in the torning over of volumes and
histories, So I wish chiefly the plage of NARCISSUS may put you in
remembrance of your present ouersighte, least in disdaininge the frendshippe
of such as excel your self every Narcissus doateth upon his own shadovve.
way, you doat upon thymage of your own shadow, and by that means yield
treble vsurye to the wrong you offer her, whose loyal affection deserves a
better reward then the return of a repulse of so small ymportance: wherewith
CORNELIO cuttinge of the rest of her waspishe discourse, desyered her to
press him with no greater ymputacion, then his offense deserved, for (says
he) in tearminge me unworthy of the title of curtesye, and that my heart is to
hard to admit the impression of love, you rather slander me by ignorance,
then accuse me by justice, saying the only force of love has forced already
a vow of my affection and heart to a Lady of MILLAN, whose presence albeit
thiniquitie of fate has taken from me for a time, yet shall the only
remembrance and inward regard of her beauty and virtue, suffice to minister
sufficient moderacio^ and chief co^pfort during ye angry dome of my hard
exile, neither shall ye force of any enchauntment, and much less ye charm of
any intysing perswacion, prevail so far over me, as once to make me
transgress the least point of my confirmed loyalty, wherein as the
Salemandre lives in the flame, so will I pyne away and consume by peecemeale in
the passion of true love, til the angrye fates, ceassinge to wreake their
malice upon me, do place me in the possession of the due meede of my merit.

Here this old enchauntresse understanding the circumstance and full of his
disease, and that his heart was so thorowlie lymed with the beauty of his Lady
at MILLAN, that it denied thimpression of her offer, wherein albeit there
appeared an ympossibilitie to wythdrawe, or at least to procure moderacion to
the vehemency of his affection, yet being no less loath to take a foil in
her enterprise, then desyerous to perform her charg to thuttermost, with
intent to return the messeger of absolute co^tentme^t, or undoubted despair,
thought not to leave him till she had Syfted and tried every synowe and
vain of his disposicion, and having but one piece of retoricke remayninge,
she boolked it out under a couertely kind of reprehending his folly in this
forte, are you one of that vain crew (says she) and archfooles of the world,
that striving to bend ye bow of loyal lovers, do make a glory of a thing as
requisite in love, as cowardnes or wa^te of courage in the soldiour meinteining
skirmish against the Constancy.
enemy? do not you think that a woman of indifferent judgment will not
rather laughe at such foil in her servant, then allow his fond constancy
begone without reason, and kept with so small discrecion. And albeit it is
glory of a Lady to be only embraced and dearly beloved, and that they have
(as it were by a special instinct of nature) a desyer above all creatures to
be the only possessours of the hearts of their lovers, do you not think for
all that, that they give not leave and liberty to their servants to make a
second choice or change of mistres, to the end they may be thoroughly resolved
of the loyalty of their seruante, and he discern the true difference between
the affections of both his Ladies. And sewer that heart is wroughte of strange
metal, and the sprite of slender capacity, that being bound (as it were) to
a task, is subject only to one simple desyer, without power to bestow his
regardes in more places then one, admit constancy to be as great a virtue as
you make it, and that the faith in love is to be kept without violacion, I
pray you in asking you one question by frendshipp, let me be answered by the
very touch and reaport of your conscience, what assurance have you of
equalitye or semblable affection at the hands of your mistrys of Myllan, whom
you have more reason to doubt, then cause to believe? Do you think that you
are only beloved, or that being punished by exile, without great hope
eftesones to recover you, she can continue as faithful for her part, as you
seame foolish in being the slave and subject of an image or shadow of a
thing so far hence? no, no, do away these toys of small substance, and let
my experience Seigneur Cornelyo prescribe you one chief and general rule, that
no woman being once disposed to love, and having the object of her fancy
taken out of her presence, is so hable to repress the humor of desyer, or
correct thinstigacion of her appetit, as it is either in her power to disclaim
at her pleasure, or degenerat from that wherein she has a facility by nature:
But as one spoiled of all resistance and arguments of virtue, she ceasseth not
to follow the queste of her licencious inclinacion, till she have found a
fresh supply to enter the lystes, and pay tharrerages of him that first
conquered the place. Women be neither equal with saints nor like unto angels,
neither are they made of other metal then such as is distilled of
thimperfections of your selves, and in place of privilege or free dispense
from the passions Women derived of the imperfections of men.
of love, I affirm them to excede all other creatures in the vehemencye of
that impression, and chieflye where the effect, does not follow thassurance of
the word: for as the drawinge glaunces of the eye, and pleasant platt of the
tongue, is rather an earnest penny of ye bargain, then a full consommacion of
thaggrement, so the hungrye appetit of the heart affected, is never satisfied to
his contentement, till he have tasted of the delicate fruit growing in the
midst of thorcharde and paradise of love, which only concludes and knyttes
up the rest of thimperfect bargain: wherein as I must confess unto you, that
both the law of loyaltye is to be observed, and faith kept inuyolable, where
we find an unity of affection, and full effect of our desyer Faith to be
obseruedvvhere the desyer is performed.
so to bestow love in the air, and live without hope of the thing that is
wished, I account, it rather the part of a madman, then office of one that
has his wits at commandment, nether does the end of such pynyng co^ceites
importe other consequence, then a loathsome wearines and unnatural hate of life,
with continual exspectation to dye, and an everlasting remembrance of his
follye after his death. And for your part, comparynge the SYMPTOMS of your
present passion, with thunlikelihod I see to have spedie end of your
martirdom, you bring in remembrance the miserable state of ye simple
sparowhake, who being hooded to take away her wildnes, syttes al ye day long
beckinge upon her Iesses and whettinge her beak upon the pearche, rather in
despair then certain of the coming of her keeper: let me pearce that hard
heart of yours with perswacions of reason, and seame not so rash in refusinge
the goodness of fortune, who albeit is accounted an enemy to most men, yet is
she also friendly to some, and ymagyn that once in the course of your life, she
kisseth your cheke, and holds her lapppe open with an offer of a good torn,
which if you refuce, is not to be reclaimed eftesones by any art or pollecie,
Convert your affection founded upon such slipper substance, and no less
incertaine of his due mede, into a balance of equal frendshippe and heart of
semblable honor and virtue, and exchange at last these languishinge conceits
that tormente your pyninge spirit, for a pleasure no less precious then of
great merit, who is no less ready the^ willing, and more apt to offer, then
you hable to receive, cease hensfoorthe to love upon credyt and cry out of
the shadow or figure of a thing, that has neither ears to hear your
complainte, nor means to releue your distress, and think that the glory of
love consistes not in the simple desyer of the mind, nor in the foolish
prouocacions of our vain conceits, but passing further, the pleasante reward
and tryumphe of that victory, consists in the consommacion of the work,
without the which, love seameth no other thing, then a bare plat or table
whereupon the painter may draw what propercion he list. And truly as there
is no man happy in love, nor has cause to vaunte of the victory, but he
that encountrethe thobiecte of his desyer, so me thinks a man should not
love that he has not, nor desyer the thing that is utterly unknown unto
him, I say thus much (Sir) because your resolute affection toward your
Lady of MYLLAN seamethe rather to argue ann humor of frenzye, then virtue in
love, and vain opinion, then true effect, aduisynge you for end to have a
care of your self and special regard to this last request of mine, that is,
in leauyng the shryne to honor the saint, and to cloase your mouth from
gapinge after that you can not get, as the vuquiet dog in the night that
barketh at the shadow of the Moon.

The Oration of this bawd seemed such Music to the ears and mind of
CORNBLIO, that he rather wished a continuance of her iargon, then an
abridgement of her tale, but seeing she gave end to her own discourse, with
exspectatio^ to hear his replye, he dysmissed her with this short answer:
albeit your present repeticion of thabuse in love (seaminge in some respect to
be assisted both with rayson and Justice) does discover diverse faltes in
sondrye women, Cornelio gives his la^^ aunsvvere to the baude.
whereof as you say the most part deliteteth as much to Run riot and seek a
change of pasture, as the other takes pleasure in the virtue of true
constancy, yet ought we to use such an integretie between the good and
evil, that the faltes of the wicked, do not deface the renown of them that
deserve but well, and as you say it is hard for a man to love that he has
not, so I note no lesse-rashnes in you to give judgment of the thing you
know not, but by examinacion: for I am fully persuaded, that no distance of
places, nor adversity of times, have power to dyminishe, and much less
dissolve thaffection of her, whose presence I hope hereafter to enjoy with no
less pleasure, then her absence seames now to give me cause of annoye. And
albeyt I have not yet tasted of the fruit which all lovers do wyshe, and few
happen to find, yet dare I account my self as depelye in the favor of my
absent mistrys, as the best of that happy company, and such weakelinges as
account no virtue in love, but in thencounter of their lasciuius desyer, and
can not rest satisfied except they crop the herb of pleasure, are always
found more liberal in words, then constant in love, and more hot in the
beginning, then hable to continue to the end, neither do I see any experience
to the contrary but that the passion which I suffer, ought rather too bear
the true title of love, then the surname of a simple desire, seeing the delight
I take in the remembrance of her beauty, is no less pleasure unto me, then if
I had alredie performed and tasted of the delicat effect of love, which I am
determined to attend, till either the goodness of a better fortune restore me to
my desert, or the force of death give end to my desolacion, willing you
herewith to correct your judgment, and cesse to inueyghe against her, whose
constancy and virtue only, defaceth the usurped comendacion of the most of
your corrupt sect: for the rest: the justice of my cause (I hope) will make my
excuse tolerable in the opinion of her that sent you, and for your paiues I
can but yield you the choice of a thousand thanks: wherewith mother retrician
took her leave and retired with less contenteme^t in her bad success, then
assured hope to prevail in the beginning, toward her MANTVAN lady, to whom
recounting eftesones ye particularities of her discourse with CORNELIO she
concluded that, he being limed with an other bushe, had no power to make a
grant of his good will without a special pasport from MILAN, where (says she)
he has left both body and heart, and appears here but in the liknes and shape
of a figure with out sense or feelyng, and less hable to admit the preferment
of honor or proffer of raison, which albeit seamed greatly to grudge the
conscience of the lady, chiefly for that she was intercepted of that which she
accounted no less sewer, then the articles of her credear to be believed, yet
waighing ye reasons of his excuse, with ye raging oversight of her self, in
indifferent balance, she made of necessity a virtue, and retired to a
patience parforce, forgetting not to punish her falt with the penance of
repe^ta^ce, and comend to ye skies the inco^perable loialty of CORNELIO, with
no less gratulation on the behalf of her, yt had Plaudyna.
made choice of so constant a servant, who for her part also, all this while was
in no less care of his weldoyng, then busily occupied in devise how to recover
his presence, and requite the passion of his painful torment which he chiefly
desired and justly deserved, wherein as she for her part wyshed no less to
embrace him, then he meritorius to possess her, So albeit there passed
certain letters between them seaminge rather to doble the desire of them
both, then yield moderation to the passion of either of them, yet she found the
means to coaste the malice of her fortune with a contrary sleyghte, by
procuryng to her husband a iorneye of xx. or xxx. days traueil, whereupon she
dismissed imediatly a corrior to CORNELIO with the reaport of ye news in this
letter following.

Albeit (sir) calamity of her own nature is so quarelous, that she ceasseth
not to assail thafflicted with continual sommonce Plaudyna aduertiseth her
lover of the departure of her husband.
of perentorye despair, yet ought we not reappose so slender assurance in the
assystance of virtue, as either to make a merchandise of the goodness of our
fortune, and much less sell the hope of future filicitie, nor yet utterly
despair of the benefyt of time, who as she is tha^^eful enoughe to such as
suffer her with patience, so has she presentlye entered into such compassion
of our mutual distress, that somonyng my husband with a journey of a months
travel in foreign affairs, she has opened us a most sewer mean to meet and
rejoice together without danger, wherein as all such seldom proffers of
frendshypp ought to be no less welcome when they come, then they seame of
tickle aboade when we have them, so if you wish to be resolved of ye which you
doubt, and have no less care of your own contentement, my advise is you
embrace the benefyt of so convenient a time, persuadyng your self that if you
were here, I would communicate with you more liberally, then I dare discourse by
letter, and only yourselfe is of creditte, to serve as a secretorye in
affairs of such secret importance, whereof you may conster the meaning,
without great study, only ymagyn that fortune is not such a nigarde of her
friendship, as spitefullyf her offer be refuced, and time so disdaineful, that
she (...) tarry a moment above her stynte. Yours without change Plaudgna.

If thies news were welcome to CORNELIO, I leave yt to the judgment of that
amarus crewe, who seame so resolute and simple in their love, that their life
is only prolonged by a desired day, but when they see an approach of their
liberty, with license to quench their hungry minds, with the fode they
chieflye wish to feed upon, god knows the small regard they have to
honor, and less respect to the duty of their conscience, and with what
slender advise and less time, they make the poor husband a rampire of horns
to defend his forhead from the shot of thennemie, wherein sewer their delight
is not so great, and glory of so foul a conquest of such comendacion, as she
worthy of treble torments, who for the glott of her fylthie desyer, and
satisfyenge their found ymportunities, does make no conscience to defile the
marriage bed of her husband, take away the renown of her former estimacio^,
deface the glory of her ancestors, and leave besides a title of villainous
reproach upon her children and posterity, of whose reputacion she ought to
be more careful, then myndefull to satisfy the greedye appetit of her own
pleasure, or folyshe pursuete of their filthy love, and from this fountain of
execrable abuse distilleth also the sondrie sorts of unnatural divisions,
happening at this day between noble houses, and men of meaner discentes, the
children detestynge the Father, and the father abhorringe them whom he thinks
to be none of his, and one brother persecutinge an other with no less
mortality of hate, then if they were common enemies of foreign contreys: for
the bed being once stained, the blod mixed, and the law of marriage abused, yt
must needs follow that the fruit procedynge of such seeds, can neither
degenerate nor be without corruption, neither can the son yield honor or duty
to him whom nature denies to be his Father, wherein albeit I have somewhat
exceded the compass of my commission, yet I am so persuaded of thindifferencie
of those few Ladies which feel theimselues toched with this short
dygression, that they will not grudge with this parable of their falte, saying
truth marches under our enseygne, ready to aduoche and witness the
circunstance of my allegacions, which like as I inferred rather to advise you,
to eschew the like evil, then for any derogacion of your honor, so yt may like
you al to excuse my reasons by thintegrety of the cause, and pardon me by
justice, retiringe now with semblable patience to the sequeile of our CORNELIO,
who construinge the words of the letter according to the meaning of the
writer, ymagined by and by thimportance of thaffaires she had too communicate
with him, wherein albeit love moved him on the one side to perform the desire
of his lady, yet reason on the other part required him to be careful of his
own sauetie, and not to buy a taste of his flypper pleasure with the price of
his life, for (says she) if you go to MYLLAN, and he discovered by any of
the french race or friends of their faction, your danger will be to great to
escape, and you shall come to too late a repentance of your folly, wherefore
ballacinge indifferently between doubt and fear, with desire to use this
occasion, least he might seame unthankful to the good will and request of
his mistres, he imparted the whole circunstance to one DELIO a dear friend of
his, of whom (being pryuye from the beginning to his amarus practice) he
demanded earnestly a special assistance of good council touching
thabsolution of his present doubt: this DELIO having ^rodden already the whole
laborinth of love, and knew by experience what an ^lne of such follies was
worth, gave as right a judgment of the disease of his friend, as if he had
felt the mouynge of his polses, or tried the disposition of his water against
the son in an vrynall, wherein he failed not to discharge thoffice of a true
friend in assaynge to remove thoccasion, and mortefye the ill with thies
perswations. Delyo persuadeth Cornelyo not to go to Millan


Like as says he small s^ares require slender medecins, and great greues are
want to try thutter most of the art of Phizicke, and that the wise and
experienced Phizision before he undertake to cure the disease of his patient, or
give certain judgment of his recouerye, does not only examine thoccasion of
his grief, but makes also his first endeavor to take away and mortifye the
cause, before he disclose the skill and hidden mistories of his art, So the
malady of love being nothing inferior to the ragyng oppression of the burning
fever, who desyereth always things that be hurtefull, and esche weth the
necessary preservatives of health, is neither to be cured nor delte with all
in any sort, unless the pacient will suffer the circumstance of his disease to
be Syfted to thuttermost, and abide an incisyon of the soar even to the
quick, to the end that by thoperacion of the Cataplame which shall be ministered
to you, you despair not of recouerye, although there appear diverse
lykelihodes of danger, nor I brought to answer for my frendshipp, which I
proteste to be without spot of dishonest intent. And as it is no less
necessary for him that is sick to reapose a special crecredit in his
Physician, then the minister of medecins to be of exquisite skyll, for that
the opinion and conceit of his conning, importes a great consolation to the
mind of him that is sick, so you must neither deny the virtue of my
medecin to work his force, nor doubt of any thing I mean to tell you, for
the tale can work small effects where the reaporter is of slender credit,
therefore before I Sifte you any further, I request you only of one thing, as
most chief and necessary to prevent the present peril, which attendes you, I
mean that in chaungynge your affection, you will also dismiss and break the
resolucion which I know your heart has alredye determined. The disposicion
and exterior appearance of your countenance, argue a wonderful devotion you
have to visitte your oracle and saint at MILLAN, which also I could well
admit, if I saw not in the end of that vain pilgrymage, a hard penance
accompanied with more perils then ever happened to the son of AVCHIS^S,
vndertakynge to visitt thinfernall valleys by the guide of his SY^ILLA. You
know well enough your banyshment from MILLAN proceeded of rebellion, and that
your offense is so heinous in the conceit of the majesty theare, that only
the price of your head can make the atonement and quench the rage of his
wrath: and saying the sleighte of your enemies and malice of fortune, have
dogged you, and your doings so nearely since your coming to Mantua, that you
have not spoken or don a thing of such council, but fame has discovered
your intent, and made your adversaries partakers of your meaning, it behooves
yon to think that of late she is not become so well affected toward you, as
she can or will conceile this last and most perilous resolution: besides in
what sort could you disguise your self, that your sondrie secret marks would
not bewraye you, or what way have you to pass, where you are out of knowledge
of al me^, and admit your own slight and pollecie were hable to prevail
above the malice of your fortune, in defending you from the danger of the
way, and diverse ambushes of your enemies, are you so persuaded of thassura^ce
of your Plaudina, that you will commit your life and loss of honor to the
fained faith of a deceitefull woman, and that without a proffe of her
constancy? If the miste of fond affection does so much dim your eyes, and
gift of present understanding, that you are not hable to discover the
legerdemaines of light women, let my experience warn you to beware of the
subtle sleightes and fine Allurementes of so venomous a serpent? What can you
tell whether this train she has made, be a stale to betraye you, and committ
you to the mercy of your enemy? or peradventure she has sent for you,
because she sees an impossibility in thenterprice, and rather to bring you
in danger, then of intent to yield satisfaction to your desyer. But let us
conster her meaning to the best, with ymaginacion that her faith is without
corrupcion, and that she is no less desirous to see you, then you (assotted
upon her beauty) seame ready to run through the fire of a thousand perils,
only to content her, will you by so vain a pleasure, that is of less moment
or abode then the thought of a man, at so dear a price as the loss of your
honor and life. Remember that the end of that enterprise can not be good, whose
beginning is not founded upon discrecion, and sequel governed by the rule of
raison, neither can you more greatly deface the ancient renown of your
honor, nor leave a greater spot of reproach to your house and friends that live
after you, then to conclude and end the course of your life, in the purseute
of so dishonest a queste, and your enemies can not so lardgelie triumph in
your overthrow and death, as your friends have cause to lament that your own
rashenes and folly were the only furtherours of the fatal bane of your life:
where of the contrary part, if being cut in pieces in the service of some
noble prince, or yield to the loare of nature in some valiant exploit or
enterprise of war, you should not only aggrauate the praise of your life passed
with the glory of an honorable death, discarge your friends and succession of
al imposicions of villainous infamy, but also force your enemies to a
conversion of their malice, into a general comendacion of your virtue and
undoubted faith toward your prince. Besides if you will wayghe the mortal
plages threatened in the gospel to be thondered upon thadulteror, and such as
contaminat the married man's bed, or rightly measure the penance of the falte
with the foulnes of the fact, you shall not only judge with me that there is no
life more dampnable before god, nor death more skandalus to the world, then to
be overthrown in the combat, which of right is due to be parformed by an
other: but also that there is more virtue and ease in sufferance, then profit
or pleasure in have, or comoditie in rash execution. But if the power of the
flesh, preuailynge above your resistance has sturred up this humor of hot
desire, which seames to press you so far that you make no conscience to
exchange your former glory, for a title or surname of a fylthie adulteror, go
not so far to seek your destruction, seeing MANTVA presents you with sufficient
choice and change of releif, better cheap and with less peril then the hazard
of reputation or loss of life.

This charm of DELYO seamed so to enchante and drive reason into the waueringe
mind of the MYLLANOIS, that he took respite to reply till the next
morninge, thanking him notwithstanding of his friendly aduertisementes which
(says he) have so vnseeled the eyes of my mind, that I find my self now
hable to discern that, which love would not suffer me earste to perceive, and
much less to fear or doubt: wherewith retiringe to his lodginge, he passed
the night in the only contemplacion of his fancy, wherein appeared such war
and contrariety of thoughts, with figures of hollow conceits, that the
desyer and course of sleep, was wholly converted into an humor of uncertain
ymagynacions, And if by chance his eyes offered to cloase their liddes, and
sommon the rest of the parts to the quiet reapposed in sleep, the
remembrance and care of his buysynes, interuptinge the office of the eyes,
presented eftfones a new conflict and second supply of his passion, in such
sort, as being to weak to resist the alaram, he yielded to the stronger
part, which was the maisterles appetit of sensualtie, and holdinge more dear
the pleasures of the flesh, then the sauegarde of his life, determined to take
the forde and try if fortune would perform as much as she seamed to promise
by a flatteringe hope, which appeared in his idle brain to embrace his mistres
without danger, ympartinge the next day his resolucion to his dear friend
DELYO, to whom says he, because perils are commonly made greater by reapport,
perils be greater in reaport then dangerous in thaduenture.
then found dangerous in thaduenture, and that all likelehodes seldom or never
do happen: the valyant ought not to fear the thing that is doubtful nor
dread the simple mouinge of a shadow, neither is there glory of the victory,
but where thaduenture excedeth thexspectacion of men, wherefore I am persuaded
to give a charg of the good will of fortune, and take my journey toward
MILLAN, tomorow, where if I be sommoned with the writ of my destynies, or
malicious dome of unhappy fortune by death, MYLLAN will serve me as well of a
tomb, as either MANTVA or other santuarie of the world, neither can I make a
better declaracion of my faith toward my mistres, then in defyenge the fear
of so many perils, to appear more ready to obey her commandment, then
curious or careful of mine own life, which I account ymploied with no less
justice on her behalf, then honor to my self, if the same be put to extreme
torments and utterly executed in the place, where the view of her own eyes may
be thindifferent judges between my firm constancy, and small dissymulacion,
neither can I leave her a more precious pawn of mine indissoluble love, then
being cut in pieces in the pursewte of her service, to leave the walls and
posterns of her pallais, painted and all to besprent with the blood of the
most loyal servant and friend that ever bare name to do honor or service to any
of that noble sect. Your desperate resolucion (says DELYO) exceeding all
thexperience I have hard or redd, of any that have been possessed with the
like infection, argues the unbridled humor of love to be a kind of rage a
thousand times more strange and less reasonable, then either the burning
fever, or frantike malady of such, as are infected with the fury of frenzye,
for what greater follye or rather desperacion can be noted in the madman, then
to Run headlong in to the midst of the fire, or commit himself unarmed to
the mercy of the glaues and sharp swords of his enemy? How may a man term
this same amarous rage, and effect of small reason and less discrecion which
accompany such as make themselves a pray to their proper sensuality, if not
some spirit or lymme of Satan sent to torment us, in making us thabhomynable
workmen of such miracles of mischief, and he that says that love proceeds
other ways then of our selves, seameth rather to mock the truth, then hable
to iustefy his argument by approved authorities, seeing the mischief is derived
of our selves, and norished of the corruption of our nature, whose wicked force
prevails so much over the gift of our understanding and darkeneth the virtue
of the spirit, that we are denied to se and much less to tread the pathe of
our duty, honesty, or conscience. But thamarous Crew of f^yuolus lovers now a
days, either to support their dampnable enterprises with a boulster or show
of a newfounde virtue, or to set a more bravery of their doings, then either
reason or conscience will allow, or rather: to make their sect favored with a
fame or name of perpetuity, have devised to christen their folly by the name
of sincere and true loyalty, which they also forget not to confirm by the
title of constancy, as though without the hazard of the soul, and absolute
destruction of the body, such execrable villenies and abuses of men, cold
bear the name or be registered in ye book of virtue, wherein albeit I cold be
assisted with infynities of examples both familiar and aunciente, yet because
such discourse would rather seame tedious, the^ thankful to the guilty mynds of
a number of our contreymen, I am content to dismiss al antiquities, and
pursewe my allegacion with thauthorytie of this CORNELIO who rather enchaunted
then ravished with the remembrance of his Lady, and suggestion of his own
folly, told DELIO for end, that if all the ways between MANTVA and MYLLAN
were strewed or pitched with rasors, and every gate and window decked with
the doble cannon ready charged to salute him at his cominge, yet (making little
or none account of these mortal perils) in respect of the duty he seamed to
owe to his dear PLAVDINA, he failed not to begin to perform ye so^monce of her
letter the next morning, when with ij. servants no less strange to him, then
unknown to al men, and himself attyred in the wede of a marcha^t trauellor, he
departed Mantua at the opening of the gates, and marching no less speedily,
then by secret and unknown paths, he measured his time according to thim
porta^ce and danger of his enterprise in such sort, as he gat wtin ye walls of
Myllan at the very last glymmer and cloasing of the evening, where refusing ye
house of his mother, because ye prospect opening upon the pallais of his
chiefeste enemy, seamed more apt to discover, then hable to hyde his being
there, he addressed him to a dear friend of his called Mes^ieur Ambrosio, where
being let in in the darkest of the euenyng, he was lodged in a low chamber,
joined as a pendle to thuttermost corner of the house, most convenient to
work his secret misterye.

His first endeavor after his saffe arryual at MILLAN, was to send for an
appoticarye, whose fidelity he had erst proved in the enterchaunge and
conueighe of diverse letters between his Lady and him who not so much amazed
to see him there whom he looked not for, as glad of his coming, for the
contentement of Plaudina, assured him of the departure of her husband, his
second diligence appeared in therpedicion he used to advertise his mistrys of
his coming, whom he requested by a letter under the conduit of this
colcarior, to appoint a convenient leisure, that he might speak to her in
secret, for (says he) the conference I have to impart with you, is of other
importance, then to be debated in the hearing of witnesses, and much less
recorded by any then the only presence of our selves.

The Lady although she desired nothing so much as the presence of her
servant, whose only coming seamed almost to make her excede the bonds of
reason for joy, yet was she semblably traunced in a passion of dreedefull
conceits and doutefull fear, the one for that she feared tho malice of the
frenchemen, the rather because they extended weekly a priuye search, upon
all the houses and places which they judged friends to CORNELIO, the other and
chief cause of her dollor was, for that by the wrong datyng of her letter, she
failed of the day of the departure of her husband, whereby she had not only
procured to him, a more danger the^ neded but also abused his adventure, in
being not hable to give so long a time to their pleasures as he iustelye
deserved and they both desired, notwithstanding she returned the messenger
with a gentle aunswere^, wherein above all other things, she gave singler
comendacion to his firm loyalty, andno less falte toher own folly and
rashenes, which because she would not only excuse, but also counteruaile or
rather excede with a recompense to his contentation, she willed him by ye
messenger, to pass by the gate in the attire of a masquer, where the would
attend his coming about x. or xj. of the clock the same evening,
resoluynge upon a certain watch word or other secret instructions whereby
she might discern him from the rest of his felowshipp. Yt is to be thought
CORNELIO did neither mislike the message, and much less forgett the hour of
appointmente, nor yet seame a cowarde in this chiefeste exployte of his
adventure, I am rather of opinion, that his foolish rashenes did so much
excede the virtue of the mind, that if the whole garrison of the frenchemen,
had been encamped in the street, and ready to receive him upon the point of
their pickes, he would rather have accepted the offer of present death, then
lost so good an occasion to encounter a simple glaunce or glee of his great
friend, who no less mindful of her promise, then ready to perform it with
a double diligence, in hope to enjoy an interest of such pleasure as love
yeldes to such as fortune makes happy and hable to receive, attended his
coming at the place and hour of accord. And as she was one of the best
Courtiars, passinge the rest of the train and troop of Ladies in beauty,
behavior and other gifts of flattering show, so was she more courted with
the continnall haunts and company of the Gentlemen and Princes of ITALY, then
any other of what degree so ever she were, in such sort as at the instant and
present approach of her servant, she was deuisinge familiarlye with diverse
Gentlemen of the City, who seeing this masque nobly mounted after the spanishe
order make their stay before Plaudina, and she for her part accepting their
curtesye with a countenance more thankeful then of ordinary, judged his
embassage to the Lady to need neither secret witness nor public audience,
wherefore not ignorant in thoffice of humanity, and because their presence
should seame no impediment to the proffit or pleasure of an other, they took
leave of PLAVDINA resigning the ca^pp and captain to the merchant stranger,
whom if they had known, they would suerlie have rated the penny worthes of
that pray at to dear a price for him to have carried away without a gage or
pawn no less precious then his life.

Here although ye fortune of CORNELIO had hlessed him, Cornelio astonished in
the presence of his Lady.
with doble felicity at one instant, both in avoiding the place of company,
and yelding him large view of the presence of his mistreys without
interupcion, yet love seamed to sturr up such alteracions and diuersaty of
amaze within him, that the use of his tongue was not only taken away, and the
rest of his parts, retired to a quyueryng fear, but also his eyes were so
resolved in the gredy gaze of her bowtie, that in place to do her honor with
any devise or show of his duty by words, he brought her in terror with the
view of his dombe behauior, resembling rather the ghastly figure of ZELIO
POLINO, whom the poets fayning to be enchau^ted by his wife, do affirm that
for the penance of his offense, and abuse toward her, he is bound upright
against a wall with a gag in his mouth, without license or liberty to speak,
til she pull the pegge from between his Jaws, so CORNELIO albeit he was an
orator sufficient enoughe, and specially in disputation of love, yet found he
here his tongue so punished with the penance of POLINO, that he cold neither
plead for himself at lardge, nor yet play the part of a stotting solicitor,
till the long view of her proporcion of majesty vnseelyng hes eyes, lent him
also a cou^tercharme to take away the mystery of his hiddeus trance, with
commission to make a breach of his scilence, and restore Cornelio speaks to
his Lady.

new benefit in this sort: if all the gifts and good tornes which fortune
ever bestowed upon such as received friendship or favor at her hand, were
here presented unto me, with license and liberty to choose which I would have, I
doubt whether I cold pike out one of such a number, that were hable to
counteruaile the greatness of my present encounter, or if they al had power to
yield me such contentement as I find in the contemplacion and regard of your
divine bewtye, and for your part good mada^, what greater proff can you have
of the honor and service with unfeigned loyalty I have long vowed unto you,
then for the only respect of ye duty I owe you, to see me comitt that which is
and ought to be most dear to al men, to the hazard of a thousand Life.

toche me with the malice of his dome, and publishe my sentence of death in this
place, I excuse him of present rigor, for that he has deferred me hetherunto,
and accomptes great justice in this fatal execucio^, seeing your self shall be
judge with what integretie I have served you, since the first vow and mocion
of my affection, whereunto PLAVDINA REPLIED, if you think you so deeply
Plaudina replieth to her servant.
in the debte of fortune, for the simple offer of so small a frendshypp, I
account my self no less bound to yield her doble sacrafyze of semblable
thanks gyuyng, not for that she has added so great a danger to the
declaracion of your goodwill (whereof I never dowted) but because in granting
us a mutual access and presence together, I may (though not so amplye as I
would, and as you have deserved) yet in some part, yield you the meede of so
great a merit: if you account the pleasure in death (happenynge in the
pursuit of this adventure) peculiar to your self, you do wrong to the
sincere love and loyal affection of your dear PLAVDINA, who resolved to pass
under the same sentence, will neither excede you in length of life, nor give
you any place in firm constancy of mind, neither do I greatly fear the
threats of present danger, considering your ancient felicity which has
always delivered you in any your attemptes what dyfficultie so ever appeared
in them, only I quarrel with mine own follye, in mistaking the day of
the departure of mye husband, and grieve no less with thyniquitye of present

proceeding of rash oversight or ignorance, are rather excusable, then
meritorious of free pardon, so although I have offended grievously, yet do I
not despair of mercy, considering that besides the confession of the fault,
I yield me to such penance as shall please you to enjoin me, which also you
shall find me ready to perform, if at the first hour after this midnight,
you comme hither in as secret manner as you can, and strikinge but once upon

Wherewith albeit CORNELIO grudged at the spedie return of ye goodman, yet
conuertyng the passion of those heavy news, into a conceit of present gladness
for the frank and liberal consent of his Lady, he contented himself with
the offer of his time and fortune, and yeldynge a low reverence to his loftye
PLAVDINA, retired in haste to his lodging, where attendynge the approach of
his hour of appointement, with no less devotion, then the Papists in France
perform their ydolatrous pilgrimage to their ydoll Saint Tronyon upon the
mont Auyon besides Roan, or our supersticious catholics of England of late
days to the holy ^oode of Chester, or image of our Lady at walsingham, he
seamed to attire himself for the bed, as though he would not stir out of
his chamber that night, by which semblance or dissimuled show, he dismissed
the company that was with him, shutting the windows and doares of his
lodging, till the dead time of the night, sommonynge all sorts of people to
rest, seamed to putt him in Remembrance of his promise and the thing he
chiefly desyered to perperforme, so that, arming himself only with sleues of
male, and a naked rapiour under his mantell, he marched toward the pallais of
PLAVDINA, with more haste then good speed, and less assurance of sauetye,
then likelihod of good luck: for as he accounted himself no less free from
all dangers, then far from any occasion or offer of peril, so fortune
displayinge the flagge of her malice, encountered him soddainely with a desaster
exceeding his exspectation, whereby she warned him (as it were) of the ambushe
of future evils which were ready to discover themselves. And albeit this
first accident was nothing in respect of the other straung mischiefs, which
she ceased not to thonder upon him, one in the neck of an other, before the
end of his enterprise, yet it ought to have sufficed to have revoked and made
him cross sail from the pursuit of so bad an adventure, saying withal there
appeared neither reason in the attempt, nor honesty in the victory. But who
doubts, that the lust of the body is not the chiefest thing that infecteth
the mind with all syn, and that the beautye of a woman does not only draw
and subdue the outward parts, but also leuyeth such sharpp assaults to the
in ward forces of the mind not sewerly rampierd in virtue, that they are not
only denied to eschew such things as be undoubtedly hurtefull both to the
body and soul, but also (drawn to desyer that, which they ought not to
ymagine, and much more abhor to do as a thing of great detestation:
besides, love is of so venterous a disposicion, sturryng up such a courage in
the hearts of those champions whom he possesses: Love makes a man valiant or
rather folishe hardy.
that he makes them not only unmindful of all dangers, but also to seame
hable to pass the lymittes of the Son, with power to excede the bonds of
Hercules and Bacchus, neither makes he any thing unlawful, which he thinks
reasonable, nor gives glory to that enterprise, which is not accompanied
with infynitie of perils: But as the wise man wishes all estates to deliberat
at large before the devise be put in execution, yeldyng no difference of
reward, with a success of semblable and equal effect to him that rashely
crediteth thaduise of himself, and such as committ their bodies and doings
to one stroke of fortune: So are we warned by thauthoritye of the same
principle, to examyne the circumstaunce of our enterprises, and cast the good
and evil that may happen with so sewer and steddye a judgment, that there can
no danger so soon appear, but we may be assisted with the choice of ij. or
iij. remedies to repress him, wherein if CORNELIO had been as throwly
instructed, as he seamed altogether infected with the humor of follye, he
neded not have fallen into such danger as he doubted least, nor despair of
that which he seamed to desyer most, and much less assailed even in the
beginning and brunt of his buysynes with that soddaine fear which earste he
was not hable to ymagine, and now as unlikely and unprovided to sh^n, for as
he attended the coming of Ianiqueta to open the doare, behold there ronge in
his ears a great brute or noise of the clatteringe of naked weapons, and men
in harneys, seaminge (as it was in deed) a set fraye between ij. enemies in
the end or corner of the same street, which was so hoatlye pursued, that one
of the skirmishers being hurt to the death, brake out of the press, and
fleinge toward the place where CORNELIO stood fainted and fell down dead at
his feet, even as the maid opened the wicket to take him in, which was not
so secretlye don, but the eyes of certain neighbors beholdynge the fraye out
of their windows, discovered the goinge in of CORNELIO with a nacked sword in
his hand, whereupon followed the alarame to the innocent lover as you shall
hear herafter: but being within the court and the gates shot again, he
was leed by the little Darioletta of their love, into a garderobe or inner
gallery, till the servants were retired to rest, who for the most part lay
out of the house that night, being busye in visiting the banquettes abroad,
according to the Epicure order of sondrye countries in christendom during
the season of shr^^tide, when diverse glottons delight in nothing but to do
sacrifyce to their belly: And having the rest An order not necessary for a
comm^^ wealth.
sewerly locked in their chambers and all occasions of suspicion or fear
either prevented or provided for (as they thought) PLAVDINA sent for her
servant into her chamber, thin king to work theffect of both their desyers and
plant the married man's badge in the brows of her husband being absent: But
here they made their reckoning without their ost, and were forced to rise from
the banquet, rather with increase of appetyt, then satisfied with the delicat
dishes they desyered to feed upon: for as they had newly begone the preamble to
the part they meant to play, and entered into thamarous exercise of kissinge and
embrasinge each other, whereof neither the one nor the other had earste made
assaie together, being at the point to lay their hands to the last endeavor
and effect of love, which the frenchmanne calls Ledon Damoreuse mercy, they
hard a great noise and horleyborley in the street of the guard and chief
officers of ye watch, who finding the dead body at the doare of PLAVDINA,
began to make such inquisition of ye murthur, with threatenyng charge to
understand the manner and cause of his death, that amongst the neighbors
which beheld the fraie, there was one affyrmed, that at the same instant that
the broyle was most hot, he saw a tall young gentleman let in at the gates
of PLAVDINA, with a sword in his hand, armed on the arms with sleues of
male, whereupon the captain of the watch began to bounce at the doare, as
though his force had been hable to beat down the walls, with such a rowte
and company of frenchemenne assistynge his angrye endeavor, that both the one
and the other of our lovers seamed indiffrentely passioned with semblable
fear, the one dowtyng this soddayne stir and ^proare of the frenchmen, to be
rather a pryuye search to entrappe him, then an Inquirendum for the murdor,
whereof he was no less ignorant then innocent, the other dispairing no less of
the delyuery of her friend, if he fell once vnhappelye into the hands of
thennemye, then doubting the dyscouerye of her own dishonestie, being known
to conceile a stranger in the secret corners of her house, wherein having
albeit but bad choice of means to avoid such ij. threatenynge evils, and
less time to take council of their present peril, yet being of opynion, that
in the sauetie of the one consisted the sewertye of them both, she used the
pollecie of the wise maryner or shypmaister, who in the furye of a storm, will
not stick to prevent the destruction of the whole, with the loss of the
lesser part, and bestowynge his wares of precius value in the sewrest comethes
of his ship, makes no conscience in such an extremety, to expose the rest to
the mercy of thangrye waves: so knowing that if CORNELIO were not discovered,
the matter would neither grow to suspicion, and much less to danger or
cause of fear, she willed him to mount into the midst of a narrow chymney,
where being denied scoape to sytt or to lean sometimes for his ease, the
litlenes of the place gave him only license to stand vprighte upon a bar of
iron rammed with stoane and mortar in both sides of the chymney, where having
his sword drawn in his hand, he resembled thymage of some Jupiter, holding
a thonderbolte between his fyngers ready to throw at such as disquietynge
his sleep, do hunte the little cryckettes chirpynge in the walls and creuisses
of the earth, and herself as more hardye or rather A woman more ready of
wit then a man in exeremeties.
ready of wytt in extremeties, discendes to the court, with all the keys of
her howsse in her hand amongst the rude watch, where after she had found
the captain, she forgate not to fordge sondrye causes of grudge against his
discurtesye, reprehendinge his inorderly dealing with many waspishe words, but
chiefly for that at so indecent an hour, and vnseamelie order, he sought to
abuse the reputacion of her husband, in breakyng open the doares of his
pallays and that in his absence, wherewith albeyt her complaint seamed to
importe a semblance of justice, with no less reason on her behalf, yet the
neighbor or first accusor, aduowchynge eftesones his confession, forced the
captain (half against his will) to follow the search, whereupon he had the
keys delivered, with liberty to ransecke each corner and cabynet of the house
at his pleasure, wherein he omitted neither diligence in execution, nor
pollecye in the search, for there was no coffer escaped without his bottom
turned upward, every bed and bolster was tried with the point of a sharpp
dagger, ye no benche nor hollow place apt to hyde a tennesball was dispensed
from the malice of thies rakehells of the watch. But when the frenchemen in
armor came into the chamber where our CORNELIO was cammed up in the tewell of a
chymney, god knows whether he wished him at Mantua with his friend DELIO or
no, and you lovers that have passed the like straites, may better judge his
passion then I hable to reaport the mystery, but me thynkes I hear him curse
and Comitt to the devil both love and all his practices, and being in
continual expectacion that some roostye halbarde should be throste up into
the chymney where he stood, I think at that instant he powered owte more
prayers to god for his delivery, then ever affore he made requests or
peticions to his Lady to enjoy her beauty, neither is it like that his
appetit continued, or his amarus humor so fervent, as his desyer great to be
further from the place of such danger: albeyt as yt is a general rule that
one evil never comes alone, so this fear was not so great, as the future
penance of hard disgestion, neither had he scarce time to take breathe before
he was assailed with a second misfortune, for understanding the watch to be
retired, and the whole guarryson of thennemies without the gates, where upon
being at the point to descend from his smoaky pauillion, as one that accounted
himself past the fear of fortune, behold the goodman alyghted at the doare,
who finding the streets pestered with people in armor, his doares open with
his house confused, and all things out of order, was no less astonished then he
had cause, and yet not so abashed at the straungenes of the thing, as his wife
in doble despair of means to avoid this second inconvenience, albeyt as
increase of peril sturrynge up a fresh supply of shyftes, pearseth the
vttermoste corner of the wits, so PLAVDINA, standing between the present
offer of open shame, and the malice of a most unhappy fortune, was driven to
retire to ye benefitt of that gift, which the Philosopher attrybutes in common
to al women, saying that in an extremety, the wit of a woman is so much at
commandment, that she is as sewer of a shyfte, as certain of her life, and
making of necessetie a virtue, she used such artificial sleighte in bleiring
the eyes of the goodman John her husband, that he allowed greatly the honest
diligence of his wife, and blamed altogether thabuse of the capteyne, whom he
threatened to requyte with semblable curtesye, wherein as she dowted nothing of
the tractable nature of her simple husband, (being glad notwithstanding to
have so smothly appeased the humor of his just anger) so she accounted her
self, neither free from cause of fear, nor quite delivered from distress,
till she had made a mean to manifest the coming of her husband to her lover
in the chymneye, whom as she knew to be passed the fear of the frencheme^, So
dowting he would dread no further danger, but discende ymediatly from his
frozen mewe, took her goodman by the hand and led him from place to place where
the watch had left al things out of order, bringing him at last into the
chamber where CORNELIO stood like a crow in a gutter or an oracle to give
answer to such as are desyerus to be resolved of dowtefull demaundes. And
albeit the vyolence of the frost, with the Nyppynge season of the winter, had
so pinched al his parts with extremety of cold, together with the passion of
fear which he felt duringe his abode in his narrow castle or cage of small
ease, yt the penance he endured seamed rather to excede the heinous respect of
his offense, then a sufficient punishment for his falte, being only a desyer
and no vyolacion nor act don, yet the veraye voice of her husband restored him
to such treble perplexity, that he seamed to feel thapproche and uttermost
sommonce of his fates, and pass through the last trance and passion of life,
for being escaped from the danger he feared most, he saw himself subject to
thaudersatye he dowted least, wherein also as the present view of his second
peril, renewed a lyuelye remembrance of his danger paste, presentyng more
ympedymentes to his delyuerye, then means or ways to Necessetie gives courage
to the fainte heart.
escape, So if yt were not that necessity gives courage to the faint stomach,
and despair brings often times a cause of good hope, I think (in defyenge
all the delays and dallyenges of fortune) he had at that instant abridged the
pursuit of his amarus enterprise, and natural course of his own life, by
showynge a tomblinge cast from the topp or greeselye rooff of his grymie
pallais. But PLAVDINA had doble reason in her devise, both to advertise her
lover (as yt were in a visyon) that albeit he was bownde to too long a
devotion, in so vnseamelye a temple, yet he should not despair of the goodness
of a better fortune, and also not to seame Ialous of her endeavor and diligence
in the redress of his case, for that she cold not (without great argument of
suspicion) habandon the company of her husband, till she had got him to bed,
wherein notwithstanding her pollecie was no less frustrate, and she eftesones
deceived, then the poor image in the chemney assailed with the malice of a
third mischief, for her husband being in bed in his own cabynet, commanded
ij. of his men that had attended him in his journey, to lie in the chamber where
CORNELIO had passed the mystery of so many tra^ses, which albeit PLAVDINA
resisted to thuttermost she cold do, yet (Mauger her heart) the authority of the
goodman prevailed, albeit dowting the cold villains (rydyng all day in the
frost) would have made a fire in the chymney, and either sacrafised the saint
that meant nothing less the^ to become a burnt offringe, or smothered as an
innocent that deserved not such purgatory, she gave special charge, not to
light so much as a candle with in the chimney: for the rest, she prayed that
the god and patron of true lovers would take such compassion of his present
distress, that if he denied him for that time the due guerdon of his rare and
firm loyalty, yet at the least he would grant him dispense, and
saffeconduit to pass through the pikes of his infortunat dangers, and as she
was thus in earnest contemplacion to the majesty of the blind god of love for
the safe delyuerye of her friend, with no less care how to redeem him from the
filthy dongeon of the hollow chymney without the raunsom of public reproach
to her self, and doble danger to him, and he also (for his part) tyering of
a patience perforce, with some hope and likelihod of good luck
notwithstanding, for that he had already escaped such.iii. hot skirmishes
of fortune, whom he judged now to have drawn the thread of her spite to an
end, behold the alaram of the iiii. assalte, more vyolent then any of the
rest, and exceeding them all in absolute arguments of perentory perils, for
the justice not satysfyed of the morder, and harpinge still upon the
confession of him that first opened the presumpcio^, sent him in the guard of
certain officers to the Lord MOMBOYER, chief of the senate before who^ he
aduowched (with new oath) the perticularyties of his former deposicion,
whereupon, was enjoined eftsoon a strait commandment to the justice, to make
a se conde search in the house of PLAVDINA, who if she were now more a mazed
then before, and almost at point to yield, to dis pair, it is to be thought pore
CORNELIO, had no less cause of disquiet, for that yeldinge himself already
dyscouered by his enemies, he judged the new broyle and clattering of rostye
halbardes, to be messengers sent by the judge to apprehende him, wherein his
opinion was the rather confirmed, for that as soon as they were within the
house, and before the good man cold make himself ready to meet them, they
made no stay till they came to the chamber of the selly housdoue in the
chymney, where fynding by evil happ a case with ^agges, and other weapons of
suspicion, brought thither by the ii. servants sleping in their own
misfortune, rather wearye with their long iorneye, then likely to commit a
morder, they condemned them by and by, as guilty of the fact, wherwyth
omitting no rigor of their office, they coppled the ii. innocents together
in a scarffe of hemp, wherein as the goodman made have to come to the reskew of
his men, he was encountered by the way, by certain sergeants or crymynall
officers, who arresting him as prisoner on the behalf of the king, ledd him
captyffe to the castle amongst the rest of his miserable servants, neither
cold he be suffered to commence matter for his own iustifycacio^, nor have
indifferency in excusing thinnocency of his men, such was the rage of these
Rakehells and officers of hell, who are commonly more pressed to oppress
innocence by vyolence, then ready to do justice sincerely according to
their oath and duty.

Here although fortune began to change complexion, and moderate somewhat her
angrye clymat toward our sorowfullouers, by lockyng the husband with the
most of his servants in close prison, yet this happy torn of her wheel
unlooked for, seamed such a mist to the mind of CORNELIO, that he was not hable
to descerne that which his heart did dyuyne, nor believe that fortune upon such a
soddaine, cold convert her angry and wrathful humor into such spedie
compassion, neither cold the conceits of his doubtful heart give other
judgment, then that the last retire and departure of the guarde, was rather a
vision or dream, then a thing of effect: such be the ordynary allaroms
appointed to quarrel The doubtefull mind is rather apt to believe the vvorste
then credyt things that b^^ (...).
with the doubtful mind, who in an extremetie, is always more apt to ymagyn
the worst, then hable to believe or give credyt to things that be true, and
when danger and peril occupy the place, confydence is often turned into
fear, and fear is of such force, that it does not only deny us to use
council in our evil, but makes us (for the most part) to refuse the thing
that should be our most sauegarde, wherein the poor CORNELIO, seamed no less
passioned then before, and assailed rather with doble despair, then hable to
admit any simple proffer of hope, in such sort as deuisinge to what saint to
vow himself, he put his special and chief confidence at last in his
prayers to the great God, whom he desired above all things with tears to
defend his dear PLAVDINA from any note of infamy or shame by his means, and
for himself, if his glass were now run out, and the dome of his extreme
destynies cold be no longer deferred, that at the least he would, by the
hand of some Angel and other virtue of great miracle, bestow him in some
soil unknown, before the fates had full power to execute the uttermost of their
rigorous commission, protesting notwithstanding, that if he might be
despensed withal for this one falt, never to be found so forgetful of
himself hereafter, if God and nature weere content to seal him an assurance
of the race and years of NESTOR. PLAVDINA on the other side seamed indyffrent lie
passioned between dissembled sorrow and assured gladness, a forced grudge and an
unfeigned joy, greuinge in the one, for thimprisonement of her husband, whose
innocencye she knew did warrant his belyuerie, and reioysinge in the other,
for that contrary to her exspectacion, fortune had made the way open and given
her consent for the consommacion of the banquet with her languishinge lover,
whose safe and happy preseruacion seamed more to delight her, then the
remembrance of the hard and wrongful ymprisonement of her husband grieved her,
neither was she so careful to redeem him from captiuitye, as readie-wyth great
devotion to give love and fortune their peculyar thanks, the one for that in
preserving his champions from the malice of danger and mark of open shame,
seamed to restore the field, and assist them with soccour, whenne they
dispaired most of consolacion, the other, for that contrary to her nature and
cus tume, she had turned theirmanifold afflictions into a pleasure more
precious and acceptable, the^ al ye desasters of ye whole world seamed
grievous, or hurtful, in which passion of joy she mounted into the chamber of
Jack of the clockhouse, who resembling a red heyring dried in the smoke
against the beginning of the next lent, attended her coming with no less
devotion then the Jews exspect their MESSIAH, and albeit, the approach of
present joy, forcinge some tears in remembrance of the fear passed, seamed
for the time to take away ye use and liberty of her tongue, yet she cut of ye
trance of that pleasant sorrow without thassistance of any special
countercharme, other then that which proceeded of a vehement desyer to behold
and speak with her friend in the chymney, wherefore after she had dried and
drained the wet humor of her waterie eyes, and dismissed all arguments of
former dule, she retired to her ancient complexion of joy, and calling with a
smyling voire to him in the topp of the rooffe, willed him to descend hardly
from his dark troane and theatrie of hell, where (says she) if god had not
devised the mean of your delyuerie, and seamed willing that you should receive
the due guerdon of your loyalty, in consenting to commit my husband to prison,
you had still remeined there, norished with the vapor of ye moon, longer then
either I would have wished, or had been necessary for your health. Here albeit
CORNELIO was sufficiently persuaded of the voice of his Lady, and that he knew
all the house to be voyed of suspicion or cause of further danger, yet the
remembrance of his peril passed, presented such a fear to fall eftsoon into
the like perplection, that he neither believed that which he hard, nor durst
forsake his habytacion on high, til he was sommoned the second time by his
PLAVDINA, who by the help of her woman, reared a lather to the top of the loft
where the grymy roode stood, who being descended and in the presence of his
Lady, seamed no less amassed, then those desolate or rather dronken creatures,
who wandering the night by unknown ways, do think theimselues guided by the
vision of some ill spirit: And the wanto^ lady on the other side, seeing the
ghastly astonishement of her friend, not much unlike in complexion to the
chymney swepers coming out of the isle of BERGAMASQVA cold not so moderat her
present gladness, but burstinge into a soddaine laughter, she seamed to
crucifye the remembrance of the tragedy passed, with the singler contentment
she took in beholdinge her CORNELIO, dyed (as it were) in the smotheringe
tanfat of hyddeous colors: And albeit (you lovers) who for a simple glee and
respect of favor of your Ladies, have earste been sprinkled, with the water of
semblable affliction, and after (getting thupper hand of your fortune) possess
the presence of your dames in such oglye and deformed attire, can best judge
of the present case of CORNELIO, I mean whether he had more cause of shame,
then astonishmente, just anger against his fortune, or reason to exclaim his
mishappe, chiefly for that he fonnd himself so brave a companion in the
lothsom badge or lyuerye of the chymneye, and whether he had so great courage
to communicate with his PLAVDYNA, resembling the black knight or feryman of
ZENOLOZ, as he showed himself valyant, in thattempte of an enterprise of so
great adventure, yet thauthorytie of my historye aduoucheth thus far of his
doings at that time, that notwithstanding the malice and diversity of all
his mishapps, with the perfumed, figure and greeselie show of himself, he
neither lost courage to demand the due meede and hyer of his dangerous
traueile, nor forgot to do sacrafise to his fortune for the retorn of her
frendshippe, affirminge there, that they did her wrong that christenned her by
the name of cruel, and such no less abused her, that termed her by the
title of an unrighteous or rigorous judge, consideringe she does but justice
sometime to check or chasten our offenses and we no reason to plead for our
selves but by appellacion to the pryuiledge of her favor, neither is she cruel
for ever, nor so maliciouslye bente in the beginning, but she is hable and
will use moderacion in her angry mood, and restore us in the end, to treble
contentacion. And like wise (says he) as the poor trauellour in a strange
country, having once passed diverse light peperills and dangers of no great
ymportaunce, is not only made stronger to encounter greater inconveniences, but
also restored to a marvelous contentment and quiet of mind, when without danger
he may enjoy his rest, and record his perils paste. Even so fortune this
night has given us an experience of diverse desasters, both to use her
aduertisemente as a special armor to resyste thassaltes of semblable
accidents hereafter, and also to confirm our affections with a stronger bond
or undoubted unity, making the pleasures of our love of greater price and
moment after so sharp storms of raging tempests. And what is he that is
worthy to taste of the delites and pleasures of the world, that is not hable
to disgeste one simple pill of bitter confection: neither does hope dekaie but
with the end of life, and the virtue of a most true and invincible loyalty,
is never frustrate nor voyed of his reward, and tochinge the storms paste (my
dear PLAV DINA) says he, like as it is a chief consolacion to a man in
calamytie to know his mishapp, so there is also a special compfort that
follows the remembrance of the evils which we have alredie suffered, and a
treble contentmente being permitted to record them without danger, and he
that is desierous to be crowned with the garland and glory of victory, must
not fear the malice of peril nor hazard of life, for who contemns death,
escapes his malice, but such as fear and flee from him, do often fall into his
danger, neither is there less fame in the valyant adventure, then in the
fortunat victory, And for my part, if my life had ended in thassalte of any
of these distresses, the same had not exceded a simple oblation of my duty
toward you, which also had followed with no less expedicion, then I had
great desyer to give you so unfeigned a show of my service, if in the very
act, had not appeared a manifest derogacion and cause of infamy to your honor,
wherewith meaning yet to prolonge his discourse he was interupted with the
reply of PLAVDINA, who more desyerous to taste of the pleasures to come, then
willinge eftsoon to prefer a second view of ye mischienes passed, wished him
to dismiss the remembrance of their former perils, and seame more willing to
embrace the gift of present time, for there is not so great consolacion in
the record of our misery past, as cause of worthy annoye, if we seame
unthankful to the new offer or gift of our fortune. And albeit (says she)
some what smiling, that your boldness was more then deserved praise, yet your
felicitye you see, has defended you from peril, and the rashness of the
valiant, is often times turned into an encrese of his glory, with double
contentement not looked for wherewith embracinge her CORNELIO, she helped to
dissornishe him of his loathsome attire, and after he had purifyed his grymye
body in ij. or iii. perfumed baines made for the purpose by the Chambriere
whilst they were in discourse, they entered together the lystes in a fair
feelde bed ready dressed, armed only with naked weapons, where it is no less
hard for the ignorant to judge their encounters, then impossible for thabsent
to witness who wan the price of the battle, only I leave the sentence of
them both to the resolucion of you (my Lords) that have or would be special
sticklors in such a combat, but thus much I may ymagine without offense,
that the innocent hornsbye in the castle, found not so much pleasure in his
prison, as CORNELIO took delight being the lieutenant of his bed, in daunsinge
the married man's round without other music then the instrument of his wife,
which both triumphynge indiffyrentlye over the infortunat and miserable bird
in the cage, and ratinge the pleasures of the rest of that night, with an
advantage of vij. or biii. days more, at what interest they thought good,
forgot not to dob him that was absent, knighte, of the forqued order of Vulca^.
And albeit fortune showed hear a marvelous partiality and co^ning in the
co^ueigh of this buysines, I mean to advance the attempt of the lover, by
the oppression and unjust captivity of the innocent husband, yet was not her
favor so clear, but there appeared a threatenyng somma^ce of spedie change,
for that the good man being justified with in vj. or vij. days trial, was
redeemed from prison, whose delyuerie was not so acceptable to himself, as
displeasant to his ij. corriuals, whereof the one feedyng him with the
reuercion and leaving of an other man, gave him only the possession of shapp
and body of a woman without a heart. And the other wearye or cloyed with the
toil of one kind of exercise, or not hable any longer to maintain the
skirmishe without fresh supplies, or fearing peradventure the torn of his
fortune, who never yeldes us pleasure without a sharp repentance in the end,
if we prevent not her dome by discrecion, was as willing to resign the forte,
as at the first, he scanted desirous to enter the breach, wheruppon resoluynge
upon an other time for the further consommacion and complot of their felicity,
they departed, not without signs of secret sorrow, appearing by the tears
standing in their eyes, the one to her husband, who wearynge by ignorance, a
forqued garland made of the leaves of the free, whereof an other had coolled and
cropped the fruit, was content with that he found, and reioysed in his happy
encounter, the other not without great danger retired to Mantua, where taking
more pleasure in the repeticion of his perils passed, then desirous (without
better advise) to reitterate or undertake again the like adventure, he
discoursed the whole to his friend DELIO, who for his part, reioysynge more in
the saffe return of his friend, then commending his wisdom in thattempt of so
rash and perilous an enterprise, exclaimed against ye detestable rage and
fury of love, which as al antiquities do affirm, to be of more force and
infection, then all the Ruberbe of Alexandria or antycyria is either hable to
heal or delaie yt least fury of so incurable a poison, so ye familiar
experience of this age, iustifiyng the protestacio^ of former time, does yield
us such diversities of examples, touching ye raging disposition of that
fra^tike humor, yt we ought not only to shon ye air of such a pestilent
plage, no les the^ the mariner, yt goth a loofe and gives place to the hard
rocks in the dangerous Occean, but also to stand so sewerlye upon our
guarde, that we seame not once to lysten to thintisynge sommance or lewer of so
execrable corrupcion, who once taking possession of the sensible parts within
us, besides that he ceasseth not to interrupte our quiett with continual
torment and passion, stretches yet his power so far, that he bringes us in
case not only to commit our lives to manifest perils, forgett the duty of our
conscience, with breach of the commandment of God, but also (to satisfye the
appetit of wanton lubricitie) he makes us corrupt the purity of the soul,
with the spott of abominable adulterye, a syn most apt of all other to
incense the vengeance of God against us, whereof we have sewer prooff in the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorra with diverse other countries and common
welthes, which he has plaged and brought to ruin, for the only lycencious
living of the people.

FINIS.
The argument.
LIke as all ages from the first foundation of the primytiue church, are
void of record, or remembrance of so great diversity in religion, as the
wickedness of our present time does present unto us, So thoppynions at this
day, are not so differente one from an other, as thabuse of the babylonian or
dyabolicall sect of Rome, appears so plainly in their detestable trade of
living, that their own villainy and fruits of corruption, discovers to the
dymmest eyes that be, how far they are from the pathe of sincere and true
doctrine, and yet marching unworthily amongeste the troop of the faithful,
are not ashamed to arrogatt unto them selves the title of thanoynted of the
Lord, with protestacion that they only bear the badge of true christianytie.
Wherein albeit, it agrees not with the task I have taken in hand, either to
axgewe or move question, because both the one and the other belonges to the
office of the Theologian or divine of Learning and authority, yet saying a
daily increase of their disorder, with a slack endeavor of such, as (having
authorytie to expose unto them the rodd of reformacion, seame rather pertiall
on their behalf, then ready (according to their duty) to yield due
punishment to their detestable error, I may without offense, bowlte out mine
opynion touching their abominable trade of life, being confirmed chiefly
therein with infynite examples of lascivious exploites and other inordinat
trade of lyuinge, in the parsones of such, as make semblable profession, and
truly as we do but right to yield a dutiful reverence to such as be true
prelates and pastors of the little flock dispersed through the world,
together with a general zeal to thorder of them that be called to the
sacred sanctuary, euenso we commit offense in mine opinion, in beleuinge that
there is any honor or commendacion at all due to them, whose lives expose
more arguments and proves of infamy, then the most vile and swearinge
ruffyan, that ever did service to thimpudente curtisan of Rome, neither is it a
seamlye honor or ornamente for the church of GOD, to see a prelatte, puffed up
with vanity, iettinge up and down the streets upon his footeclothe,
attended upon as a satrapas with a train of dashbucklers or squaringe
tospottes, and him self pinked and razed in thattire of a young bridegroom,
with his hear curled by art, fallinge in locks, as it were by appointment,
upon his forheade, with more curyositie, then an old ydoll or image of venus,
perfuming the streets with the smell of musk and amber, which he has
conyngely enclosed in the seames of his garments, besides what example of
virtue is it, to see one of our reverend religious fathers and gouernous of
couentes, more given to court the dames with requests of sensuality, then to
torn over the leaves of the new testament or other sacred institucions, left
unto us by christ and his disciples, and emploie more study in devise to
seduce and subborne their neighbors wives and daughters, then to visit their
diocese, and defend the sely sheep against the malice of the raueninge wolf,
seking to devour the few that be left. Is he worthy to be admitted to feed
the flock, or bear the title of christ's shepherd, that lives in more
adultery, fornycation and dronkenes, then he that makes an only profession of
such evil all the days of his life? or how is he hable to reclaim such as be
out of the way to salvation, that detesteth the scripture, delites in
wickedness, and preferres absolute examples of the most perentory sin that can
be, whereof thytalyan bandell, has drawn a most true and lyuelye pattorne
in the person of a neapolitaine Abbott, which I have accounted of necessity
to prefer amongst my volume of discourses, as well to the confucion of him
self, and such as resemble him in condition, as to give worthy glory to the
virtue of a pure virgyn, who had her honor in such reputacion, that she sought
rather to end her days in the defense of her chastetie, then to commit the
use of her body, to the fleshly will of an Abbot, more full of villainy,

laborynth of Dedalus, with the sumpteous pallays of the Roman Lucullus, whose
lodgyngs, with so many crooked turnings and windinges every way, windows,
chapells and places of solitary resort, excedyng (according to the poets)
the co^putation of man, were swallowed in a momente in the deuowrynge throat

Europe is hable to furnish, wherein I am chiefly moved to note you a particular
discriptio^ of this paradise, to thend yt as the places of solemn and solitary
regard, do commonly mortefie in men all occasions of wanton exercise, so the
planet that governs those plattes of earthly pleasure pricking forward our
effeminate dispocition, sturreth up the humor of Lasciuius lust with an
inclinacion more ready to perform the frail suggestion of the flesh, then
provide for the health of the deuyne part of the mind, which is the soul,
neither is our present age so plentiful of virtue or virtuous effects, but
the view of our ancestors lives past, gives us sufficient cause to blushe and
be ashamed, in that we are found so weak in thymy^acion of their exploites
and exercises of virtue, wherein besides an infinity of examples procedyng of
the wickedness of our time, I may be bold to confirm mine opinion with a
familiar experience of an Abbot of Naples, whose young discrecion, equal to
the grenes of his years, made him no less insufficient to govern the state of
his vocation, then unable every way, to discharge thoffyce wherein he was
invested by oath and habitt of religion, for having also the consent of noble
race (whereof he was descended) to favor the wilful appetites of his unbridled
youth, he took more delight to assyste the exercises of nobility, I mean in
making one at all manner of daunses, masks, momeries, dressed for the honor
of ladies with covered faces, and other recreacions of pleasure convenient
only for the courtyer, then to sit in the chapter house upon reformation of
his monks, or to ymploye any part of his time in the study of the sacred
volumes of the church, he was also admitted a necessary compagnion to some of
the governors and capteines there, for that he kept an ordynarye table and
free diot for gentlemen, being a thing most acceptable to the Spanyarde, who
at hoame keeps him within the compass of thyn and sober chere, and abroad is
nothing inferior to the devouring Almayne, resembling by that means, the
sparynge order of the nigardes of old time in their dry and hungrye
banquettes, and to the sin of this excesses in delicate fare, he added an
offense no less heinous and most vnseamely for any of his calling, deuidyng
the day into hours, and hours into ymitacion of pleasures, some time he was
seen in the streets in thattire of a galla^d or young courtiour, some time he
visited the hauntes and assemblies of ladies, courtyng such of them as he
found to give most ear to his idle talk, neither respectyng the opynion
that passed of his lightness touching the violacion of the hollye order of his
profession, nor the dishonor he did to the house from whence he discendid. But
gloried rather in that he cold so artificiallye perform the parts of a
Philantos or flatteryng lover, then in reuelyng the mysteries of the scripture,
to seame to ymitate the true simplicite of life of his virtuous predecessors
in that place, whereupon followed ymediatly a declaracion of the vile fruits
of so vicius a life, for as Mousieur le Moyne passed one day in great brauerye
upon his footeclothe through the fairest street of Naples, exposyng a rich
show by reason of the glee of the gold smithes shoppes, he glaunsed by chance
upon one of the faireste women (as he thought) harbored at that time within
the walls, and followynge the pursuit of her beautye with a gredye gase of his
eye, (maugre his heart) he was forced to a soddayne stay right over against
the place where she was, which time of abode, his eyes forgot not to imploie
in taking large measure and view of her proporcion every way, making such
reaporte to the heart and rest of the interior parts, that in one momente he
became assailed with that wherein he was ignorant for experience, and less
assisted with necessary resistaunce, feelyng within him a hot war between
the sencesible parts of reason, and sensual provocation of ye flesh, with a
present captivity of Love a common enemy to the ease of man.
his ancient quiet by the common enemy of the ease of man, which we call
properly the passion of love, who at this first encounter, rampired himself so
strongely within ye inward parts of this young Abbott, that he only
governed his thoughts, and disposed his doings altogether by his discretion,
ceassinge not to flatter his fond humor with instinctes of vain conceits,
til he brought him to ye stage to play ye last act of the Comedy, where he
received the due guerdon of his follye with open shame and rebuke of the
multitude, and when time sommoned this religious fondlynge to depart from the
view of his new mistres, he seamed in no less pain, then if their had been
present incision made into his intrailes, to cut insonder the stringes where
upon his heart is staide, or that (according to the Poets) he felt the Egle
of promotheus peckinge upon his liver. The girl was the daughter of a
goldsmith, no less dear to the father, then extremelye beloved of her mother,
both for her beauty and promptnes of wit, and also for that in her young years
appeared such arguments and signs of virtue, that she was noted the paragon
and patorne of all degres of her time, for woma^ly behavior, and nothing
inferior to the best touching ye chaste order and honest conueighe of her life,
wherewith she beautifyed the mean discente of her parents, and left a rare
example to the Ladies of greater calling, who think, their renown
sufficientlye confirmed by the height and honor of their house, without
puttinge to the accion and effect of virtue, which in deed, as it is the badge
of true nobility, so it has also authority to make noble the meanest descent
that is, and truly as the vain woman exalts her self, like to the birds,
whose natural lightness conueighe them to the stars, I mean takes pleasure
in the abundance of her riches, prefers the magnificencie of her house,
ymagininge her beauty to be worthy to sytt in the highest Theatrey of the
world, so the wise woman is glorified, only in ye gift of sincere and pure
simplicity, with a wonderful care to keep her name without spott, and the
course of her life so upright, that the malice of evil tounges may have no
power to enter, and much less perce with any worthy slander, but now to
our Gansaldo, and amarous Abbot, who bathing in the lake of his follies,
thought as great ympossibilitie to retire or dismiss this first alaram or
sommonce of love, as to comprehend all the water of thoccian within a little
vrynall, neither would he dispose himself to try the force of any resistance,
but determined (at what price soever it were) to ymparte his passion to the
girl, which he ymagined would move in her a consent of reciprocal affection:
here in the opinion of the poet is justified saying, that lovers reapose a
certeintie in dreams, and proclayme a sewer victory of thuncerteine object of
their fancy, like as this fond abbot being lymed with a simple look or
glaunce at unawares, does promise himself the conquest of the pray, against
whom he has as yet used, neither force nor pollicye and much less dressed any
ambushe, he forgot not every day in the weke to make his purmenado on
horseback in the street, where dwelt the saint to whom he had vowed such
solemn devotion, wherein for a more glory of him self, and the rather to
seduce the maid, he appeared in several attire and chaung of horse twice or
thrice a day, not forgettinge in passing by the house of the goldsmith, to take
measure of the doare, glaunce upon the windows, and perce with the drawig
regards of his eye through every creuise of ye wall, to the^d he might encownter
a second view of her, whose first regard, had ministered unto him the brothe
of infection, and if fortune were content at any time to give him a sight of
her, whether it were at the doare or out of the window, or in other place which
denied him favor or liberty to speak to her, I think he forgot not to expose
arguments of his grefe, by the pitiful regards of his countenance, wanton
torninge of the eye, and other messengers of his passion, arguing the torment
he endewred for the desire he had to do her service, he understood at last by
secret inquisition, what church her mother haunted for the performing of her
prayers, and that her daughter was her only companion in these deuocions,
whither also he directed his pilgrymage, and dissymulinge with GOD, he plaide
thypocrite, in conuertinge his regardes from thalter or place of leuacion, to
behold the beauty of the goldsmithes daughter, the saint to whom his heart
yielded most honor, making of the house of prayer ye shop or forge to frame
iniquity, exceeding in this respect, the barbarouse abuse of the Etheniques
turks and infidells, who give more reverence to their Mosques, where God is
blasepheimed and his Son abiured, then the christians now a days to the
temples and houses dedicated to the Lord, to perform the ministracion of the
sacraments, with open publicacion of the will of our savior Christ, whom with
saint Paul we ought to pray, for the subuercion of babylon, and restauracion
of the true Church, dispersed into diverse corners of the world, by the malice
of the pope and his wicked disciples, whereof this Abbot, being not the least in
authority, was nothing inferior to the most abominable in all vices, whereof
he gave sufficient proof in two offenses of equal detestacion, the one in
seking to deflowre a maid, contrary to the oath of his religion, the other in
abusinge the house of GOD as a place of bawdye practice, to perform theffecte
of his cursed devise, being more deuowte in courtinge the Ladies of NAPLES,
then curious to reform thabuses of his idle couente. But the girl notinge
thinconstant order of prayer in our reverend father GONSALDO, to gether with
his wanton regardes full of lasciueous desyer, ymagined by and by, with what
iron the gentlemanne was shod, and to what saint he would gladlye offer his
candell, wherefore thinkinge it no breach of good manner to play
mockhallyday with such a master fool, gave him skoape now and then to
hehold her at large, and to beat the hammer more deep into his head, would
requite his amarous glaunce with a semblable glee, and suddenly retire and
vanish out of his sight with an angry farewell, as though she disdayned his
wanton offer, with intent notwythstandynge to shonne his voice and place of
presence no less, then thincounter of any venemus beast, fearinge to reapose
either credytt in his honesty, or so much assurance in her own pudicitie, as
to open her ear to the charm of a frivolous lover, or who thinks it no
offense to take away the purity of a maid, whom we may compare to the red
rose, desiered of enery one so long, as the morning dew mainteineth him, in
odyferous smell and pleasant coollor, but when the force and heat of the son
has mortyfied his oryent hew, and converted his natural freshnes into a
withered leaf: the desire to have it dekaieth with the bewtye of the thing,
euenso she that has once morgaged the flower of her virginity, is not only
despised of him to whom she has been so prodigal of that which she ought
to make a most precious Jewel, but also in common contempt with all men,
what show of dissembled courtesy soever they present unto her, whereof the
mistres of GONSALDO was nothing unmindful, who preferringe the honor and
reputacion of chastetie, affore all the respecttes of the world, seeing wythall
that the blind Abbot pursewed more and more his amarous quest, prevented his
expedicion, by making her a stranger to his presence, shonnynge all places of
his repair, and to take away all occasions that might give increase to his
desyer, she forbear to visit the churches, onelesse it were at such hours as
they were void of other company, and yet with such regard, that she made
(as it were) a privy search in all the corners and quyers of the temple, to
prevent his subteltie in dressinge some ambushe to invade her upon a soddaine,
and if by chance he saw her and saluted her in the streets, she crossed
saite on the other side, and closed her eyes, as against some hurtful
encownter, yelding him no other countenance then she might have auowched to
the most infydell in the uttermost Islands of Tartaria which brought the sely
freare into such mortal perplexity, that despair began to appear, with
thapproche of sondrye perentorie diseases, chiefly for yt the hyer of his
earnest love was returned with sundry sorts of crueltye and disdainefull
repulses, occupyinge his brain with such contrariety of thoughts, that he
was void of council to what saint to vow himself, or upon what wood to make
his arrows, saying he was neither hable to mortifye nor use moderacion in his
passion, and much less was assisted with any mean to communicate the
greatness of his grief to her, whose beauty had made him the slave of folly,
wherein albeit he saw a vanity to use the office of a Dariolleta or bawd,
for that the virtue of the maid argued a detestation of such Ambassadors, and
to write to her appeared a great difficulty, for that she was always in the
presence of her mother, who vsinge the virtue of her daughter as a solace of
her old years, was no less careful of her honesty, then be longed to so
precious a Jewel, yet felinge a continual aggrauation of desyer, with a
flattering offer of love to reward him in the end, with the pray of his
purseute: he determined to suborne a shameless messenger to bewraye his shameful
intent, and therefore put his request upon terms in a letter of this
effect. If my destenies had don execution The Abbot vvriteth to his mistres.
upon my body, when first they brought me to the view of your beauty, I
had not ben a present experience of your crueltye, nor you thoccasion of my
unworthy torment, for if death by nature, had prevented the beginning of my
love, I had been free from the force of passion, discharged of all mortal
grief, and you dispensed with all, from the imputation and cause of a double
ill, the one to abuse the virtue of your self, and do wrong to the renown of
al women by preferring effects of rigor, the other in disdaynyng the service
of him, whose life and death payseth indifferentlye in the ballaunce of your
good will, dissembling also not to see the circunstaunce of my love, to drive
me to desperacion, and at the point to use unnatural force against my self?
How often alas, have I made you priuye to thinwarde affection of my mind, by
the outward regardes and glaunces of my exterior parts? How often have you
acknowledged the same by argument of semblable glee, and immediately denied the
whole by a soddaine show of angry complexion, either disdayning utterly
thoffer of my service, as one unworthy to enjoy the preferment of your favor,
or dalyenge with my earnest suit, to give increase to my passion. I have often
been upon the way to disclose unto you by mouth, the thing wherein your heart
has already given iudgmente of my meaning, albeit the desire not to offend
you any way has staide thexpedicion of my intent, suspendyng my grefe, till
the greatness of the same has forced a present vente with this simple request,
that as, fearinge to ymparte the full of so great a matter to so uncertain a
messenger as a piece of paper, so it may please you to give me credit of
co^fere^ce, where only our selves may be witnesses of that which I have to
discover and am no longer hable to conceile, wherein if there be any bond of
consideracion in great Ladies, on the behalf of the offer of their inferiors,
ymagin how justly I deserve well of you, and with what reason you ought to
pass a grant of so small a favor to him, who is no less hable (as you know)
to procure your advancement with what portion of wealth your self shall
think good, then ready to perform all such things as you shall but ymagyn
and wish to be don, whereof I send you a confirmacion herewith, sealed with
the oath of my religion, and with protestacion of the faith and life of your
most loyal and desolate seruante. GONSALDO

words, which foolish suggestion restored the Abbot to a hope, and making
conscience to committ the conueigh to the creditt of any of his covent, for
that he doubted their wisdom in performinge so secret an embassage, used
thexpedicion by one of the vallettes of his chamber, whom after he had put in
remembrance, of thauncient favors he had used on his behalf, and how much
he reaposed for himself in the assurance of his fidelity, he said he was now
to imploye his faith and diligence in a busynes of no less value, then the
price of his life, wherein says he, albeit thou may conster some part of my
meaning by the circu^staunce of the late change and alteracio^ thou haste
noted in me, iudgyng peradventure the same to proceed of some amarous humor,
yet, although I consent and make good the conceit of thy fancy in that
surmise, thou nor all the deuinours of the world can name her, who (as thou
see has made me the flaue of her beauty, this is the secret wherein I am to
make a last experience of thy endeavor and wisdom, to make a present of
these letterrs to her, who has not yet vouchesaffed to lend me the use of one
simple regard of favor, to qualifye the heat of my burning martyrdom,
wherewith he told him the name of his mistres, the street and sign where her
father dwelte, with strait commandment in the end, not to omit any moment
or offer of time that might seame to further ye execution of his charge: the
vallet glad to have so good a mean to make declaration of his loyal zeal
toward his master, admitted the enterprise and gave him assurance of his
diligence, willing him in ye mean while not to loase courage, for that says he
there is no fortress so well defended, but at length it is rendered by
composicion, or won by assault, wherewith the Abbott departed to his chamber
flatteringe himself with the promise of his man, who destrous to reliue the
distres of his master, added such diligence to the dispache of his commission
that the next day he found the means to accoste Parolyna occupied al alon
in her meditacions in the church, where presenting himself before her with more
assurance, then the passioned Abbot, gave her the reverence of his Country,
and desiered her not to dismay, if upon so small acquaintance, he discharged so
boldlye the part of a familiar messenger, wherein says he, if there be
offense I prefer (good madam) for my excuse my lord and master, upon whose
behalf he craved so much favor as to read his letter, which after he had
kissed wit great humilitye, offered to the chaste maid, who knowing the
messenger, for that she had seen him often follow the train of Gonsaldo, gave
judgment also of the cause of his coming, wherefore she did not only refuse
it, but also with certain terms of reproach, returned him with an answer
contrary to thexspectation of him self, and contentment of him that sent him,
what says she, does your master account me of such simplicity, that I have
not long since discerned thinte^t of his folly? does he think that I am any
other then one that settes as dear a price of mine honor, as the best lady in
Italy? or is he of opinion that the respect of his authority or greatness in
degree can force me ye rather to a remorce on the behalf of his wicked meaning,
no, no, tell him I have neither to do with him, and less cause to accept his
letters, neither ought he to adresse such embassages to me, who can, nor will
not be thankful to any in love, but such as my parents shall give me in
lawful marriage, is this his masque of holiness, to cover so great a villainy
under the habit or shroude of simplicity? what argument of virtue is this in
him, whose office is to prescribe principles of honest life? can he discharge
the oath of his religion, in seking to corrupt the purity of virgins, and
expose an example of the greatest villainy that is? Let him besiege the forte,
that is as glad to yield, as he ready to sommon, and bestow his charms and
letters upon those, whose regard and care of honor, is equal to the malice
of his meaning, and for your part let it suffice you that I pardon your first
folly, and cease hensfurthe to proceed any further, least you be paid with
the money ordained to discharge the hyer of such messengers, wherewith she
flonge out of the church and not without some passion of just anger,
repaired to her fathers house, not ympartynge any part of thaccident to any
one of her parents, trusting that as her desire and intent was to live in
the trade of an honest woman, so God would assiste her virtuous respect and
defend her chastetie against the malice of the wicked, she douted to discover
the case to her mother, for fear some slander would have followed, neither
durst she imparte it to tholdeman, least in complainynge of the wrong, his
poverty had been found to weak to contend against thautoritie of
thabbot, and by that means to have been worse delte with all then either he
deserved, or she desiered, but leaving in example to al women to use like
modesty in semblable distresses, she committed her self and cause to the
protection of the heavens. By this time the valiant messenger of GONSALDO was
returned to his master, communicatinge not only the perticularities of her
answer, the disdain she showed to his letters, and small account she
seamed to make of the offer of his good will, but also persuaded him to correct
the humor of his appetite, and dismiss the remembrance of her beauty,
bestowinge his affection upon some such as hatbe more discrecion to yield him
consideration, then the folish daughter of a simple artisan, which reaport,
albeit brought an increase of doble passion to the martiredom of the poor
Abbot, both for that the terms of her answer argued an agrauacion of her
creweltie, and absolute despair hereafter to enjoy ye benefit of her good will,
yet he had ye gift to dissimu le thinward panges of his grefe with a wonderful
patience, converting his humor of fretting mallencolie into terms
Thexclamacion of the Abbot.
of sorrowful exclamacion in this sort, ah says he, I see well ye art ignorant
in ye forces of love, who is not easily suplanted after he has once conquered
the rampire of the heart, neither art thou privy to the operacion of his
pills, who differynge from the nature of other passions assailynge the mind
of man, do make us desyer that we can not get, and love the things which
hates us mortallye, and is not this a sufficieut experience of the peruersitie
of women, saying the more I endeavor to prefer my service to my cruel
Parolyna, the less account she makes of mine offer, and the more I languishe
in desyer, the greater pleasure takes she in my martiredome, that I wish alas,
that some oil of holy thombe, might presently close mine eyes against the
light of this world, or else the virtue of some happy enchauntment distillinge
from the arbor and pot of some Elysea, might with speed remove the veil of
her rigor, and sturr up an humor of compassion to the relief of my painful
tormente: I see thy advise is justified every way by reason, and when I
dispose my self to follow thy council, I feel within me (I know not what)
which forces my will with constrainte to purseue the sommance of mine appetite,
in such sort that the voice which uttered the repulse, has also pronounced
the fatal sentence of my life, wherein he had yet proceeded, but that the panges
of inward sorrow compellynge the conduites of waterye humors to discover
them selves, forced a vente at his eyes in great abundance of tears, which
drownyng the words of further discourse in his mouth, moved his vallet also to
equal dolor, who notwithstanding preferred such consolacion to his master as
sorrow would give him leave to utter, with a frank offer to pawn his life
with the rest of his worldly portion, to redeem the quiet of the Abbott, and
put him in possession of her whom he accounted the sufferayne CATAPLAME for
his mortal disease, wherewith he conforted eftesones the selye GONSALDO, who
telling him that after he had got the consent of convenient time and
opportunity, he would somon him to an effect of his promise, dismissinge
therewith his faithful servant, and retirynge himself to a simple comfort in
this last resolucio^, for certain days forbear to visit the streets,
churches or other places, where before he was wont to make his offeryngs and
purmenadoes, thinking in shonnyng the places of her repair and presence, he
should at last force a forgetfulness of her beauty, wherein notwithstanding
he seamed to sprinkle water upon hoatte cinders, and brought more oil to his
match, and all his traueile therein sturred up a fresh supply of drawing
baits, mouinge an increase of desyer, with augmentacion of his follye, which
after he assaide to putt in execution, for the more he went about to root out
the remembrance of her beautye, the more suerlye did love imprinte her picture
in the bottom of his heart, with provocation not to give over the queste, but
proceed in the pursuit of so pleasant a pray, in the day the whole cloisture
or circute of his abbaye cold skarcelye comprehend the sondrie ymaginations of
his brain, and his bed in the night presented him with as much rest, as he
that is bound to tread continually the laborinth of endless toil, wherein
rauynge thus in a passion of contrarietye of thoughts, he accused him self of
cowardnes, for that the offer of so fainte a resistance, made him retire his
force, without gyuyng a more ^oate assault to the place he meant to conquer,
wherewith, remembering how often he had hard, that women (what desyer so ever
they have of them selves to be thankeful to him that courts them with the
offer of love, yet take they notwythstandynge a singler pleasure to be assailed
with importunities intermedled with a little constrainte or force, determined to
imploye thuttermost of his forces, and to pay him self (maugre her
resistaunce), the hier of his traueile with the most precious Jewel or
treasure she had, at such time as fortune would give him the favor of a
convenient time and place, to leuy the last alaram, thinking with the
advantage of his policy to compel her to tread, the dance which she never
mente to practice, if not in lawful marriage: here you may note a familiar
experience, that he that is in love, albeit he be blind, touching the
knowledge of reason, yet for the devise and exe, cution of a follye he has
more eyes, then he whom the Poets affirm to have an hundredth lights for the
guard of Jupiters cow, for that this folishe Abbot attendyng daiely an offer
of commodity and advantage of time to give a charge upon his plainsante
enemy at unawares, used such diligent watch to discrye her doings, that he
was made privy to the certain hour wherein she was determined to attend
upon her parents to a fearme or graunge, they had not the most part of a
league from the City. In which oportunitye and offer of thankful time the
blind Abbott reaposed a singler commodity of his cause, for that as you have
hard he determined to invade her with an ambushe at unawares, and so rauishe
her out of the hands of her parents by main strength, whereunto he added an
effect without regard to the slander which attended so wicked an
enterprise, or thabuse he committed against the order of his religion, and
much less the estimacion and honor of the house whereof he was descended. Let
this experience suffice to confute the opinion of the most of our lovers now a
days, who making a God of the ydoll of love, do not let to give him place
among the most perfect and heroical virtues that are, affirmynge that all
ciuilitye and curteys behavior amongst men, is derived of the discipline
taught in his skoole, let the effect of his rage I say, declare his
disposicion, and be the equal judge whether he be an indifferent evil or a
pertiall vice, for setting your partycular affections aparte, I know you will
confyrme mine opinion thus far, that, he which you call love and would that
we honor him with a title of a God, and give him a power more then human, is
no other thing, then a brutall passion of the mind derived of that part
which nature has made common to us with beasts, touching sensualytie, and he
which laboreth in the disease of that folly, is in no other degree, then he
that is possessed with the spirit of fransie and desperation, look in the
second book of the kings, and tell me what planett or spirit governed AMNON
the son of DAVID, who doatyng upon the beauty of his own sister, made no
consience to deflower her and take away her chastetie, which horrible act
would have procured terror to the most mortal enemy, both for the horror
and detestacion of the syn, and also for the honor and reverence which all men
ought to give to the chastetie of a maid. The prince of SICHEM being
extremely enamored upon the beauty of the daughter of Jacob, did it suffice
him only to love her in honest sort? did he stay him self upon your
masqued and dyssymuled loyalty? no, he did that which is judged tolerable to
you al and would be common to the most of you, if the rigor of the laws, had
you not in awe, and preferred a fear of torments and worthy punishments, he
ravished her by force, whereupon followed the ruin of him self and
subuercion of his people, for end, if there be any one amongst you that
absteyneth from like violacion, I think (sewer) he is not stricken with
thextremitie of love, but that his mind has tasted but of a simple impression
of that folly, seeing that he that is touched to the quycke, can hardly
refrain from execution of like villainies, amongst whom notwithstanding I
co^prehende not thintegretie of them, whose wills tend to do honor to the
hollye bed of marriage without violacion, for that I am persuaded those
affections proceed from above, and approved by god him self, but I inueigh
against their unhonest desiers, who respect nothing but the pleasure in that
wherein Mars and Uenus strove for the maisterie, at such time as vulcan
discovered their naked bodies, which I can not term so properly in our vulgar
phrase, as the frencheman includes in thies three words Le don damoureuse
mercy, the delight whereof, dekayinge with the end of thact, makes them loath
the thing wherein carste they took singler pleasure. Here you may see also a
worthy example in this master Abbott, who of a pastor and shepherde of the
heard, becomes a deuowrer of the principal sheep in his flock, and leauinge
thabit and attire of religion, is invested with thaccotrementes of a villain
and dysposicion of a barbarus Lyrant, that has neither knowledge of God, nor
fear of his laws, wherein my conscience would serve me to use a further
discourse touching thabuses in thies ypocrytes, saving that (God be praised)
our realm is happily purged of such filth and replenished with a plentiful
crewe of thundowted, and faithful mynisters of gods word, neither will I
troble my history with the sundry enormities and practices of hell which I
noted in some religius houses in france during my being there, because my
theme at this time, is not to treat of thabuses in their religion, neither am
I assisted with sufficient time, for that if I should but abridge their
disorders into a tenthe part, the volume would excede the bigness of the bible,
wherefore it shall suffice me to desire God in my prayers to remove the veil of
their darkness in time, least their iniquity procure him to thonder like
desolation upon them, as he did upon the children of Israel, when they
forso^e him, and bowed down to images, whereof their own hands were the
carpenters, and now to the sequeyle of Don Gonsaldo, who harpynge only upon
the string of his damnable resolucion, imparted thenterprice to his man who
(as you have hard) engaged his faith to be the minister of his will, in what
respect he thought good to ymploye him, and having eftesonnes preferred a
repeticion of his promise with an assurance by oath of thuttermoste he was
hable to do, thabot told him yt within few days his mistres went to perform a
banquett with her father and mother out of the city, to whom says he,
seyinge I have forgott no expeperience or importunity which humanity can
devise, and seeing that in the enioyinge of her beauty, consistes the
continuance or diminucion of my days I am determined to retire to the benefit
of my last refuge, which is to employe thutter most of my forces in using
her by main encownter upon the way between the town and her fathers graunge
in ye country, wherein as thou have alredye assured me of thy help by the oath
and religion of thy faith, so thou must strain thy self to procure a further
aid of such companions as thou accomptes necessary to assiste thexpedicion,
to thend that when the matter shall be brought to the trial of force, we be not
found to weak in the dispatche of our entreprise, which albeit may importe
unto the and such as thou shalt subborne for thy companions in this case,
both a grudge of conscience, and fear to fall into the rigor of the laws,
yet thou art not ignorante that thauthoritie of my profession is sufficient to
dispense and absolve the sin, and my power hable to prevail above
thextremitie of justice in this or any other respect of what importance so
ever it appear, neither will I stick to deffraye the whole plate and treasure
of my Abbeye in defense of the quarrel against the whole state and senate of
NAPLES, wherewith he dismissed his manne, who with the pleasante platt of his
tongue and prodigal promises of liberal hyer, was furnished ymediatlye of
his trayterus crewe to betraye thinnocente maid, who for her part seeing
GONSALDO had discontynued his mosters in the street, and hawnte to the
church where she is wont to perform her devotion, thought he had also
disclaymed the vehemency of his passion, with intent no more to pursue her,
wherein as she accounted her self most free from peril, so she found an
approach and offer of danger, which affore she was not hable to ymagyn, for
that thabbott being advertised by his espiells of the day and hour when the
maid should go into the country, measured so ryghtlye his time with the
momente of her departure, that some one or two hours affore, he somoneth his
conspiratours and goes out of the Town not in his frears weed or attire of
his profession, but disguised in such sort as he was not known to any but
the ministers of his intent, whom he bestowed in ambushe in an unknown
couerte ioynyng to the path by the which the goldsmith and his daughter should
pass, who thinking upon nothing but the plaisante regardes which the
fresh and grene feeldes dydd yield and much less ymagenynge any secrett
practice or villainy conspired against them, entered with great delight into
the pathe of their misfortune, for near unto NAPLES there ronneth a little
river discendynge from certain rocks giuynge necessary moisture to the
valley near the town, which the poet SANAZARO in his ARCHADIA calls
SEBETH deuydynge her self into two arms hard under the walls, whereof the one
falling into certain pipes of lead becomes serviceable by the art of man to
thinhabitantes of Naples, the other, stretchynge toward the champaine,
refreshes as she passes the meadows and cornefeldes adioyninge with the dew
of her silver streams and in the end yeldinge tribute to the great flude
Thetys fauls with a soft noise into ye sea, who receives her with an
embrasyng worthy for so plaisa^te a neighbor, over which river is builded a
bridge passible for horse and man called Madalyne bridge, shrouded with the
branches and long spraies of certain willowes growing on either side the
broke, the commodity of which strait with thaduauntage of the place offered
them selves (as it were) to assiste the enterprice of thabbot in thincou^ter
of his plaisant enemy, who disposed to more joy then her weary parents, went
alwais affore them, supplieng the time and tediousnes of their travail, with
sondrye plaisant devises, and as the heat of the day with thexercise of her
body in goinge, had set a broche ye veins of good blod through all her parts,
whereby to ye pure complexion and white of her face was added an orient die of
red, so her hear, of ye coollor of amber curled by nature, and fallinge in
locks upon her forhead, covered as then with an Escarsion of the fashion of
pyemont, gave such an increase to her beauty, that with the help of the shade
and shadow of the tres, pauisinge the vyolence of the son, with the glee of
the pleasante, stream assistinge the natural white and redd in her face her
eyes glistering as the clear stars in the lofty sky, made her seame
nothing inferior to the per fection of her whom the poets have crowned with
the title of a Goddess and Queen of be wtie, wherein if this brauer ye of
parolina gave great delight to the old years of her parents, who knew the
arguments of youthful joy which appeared in their daughter, where but
recreacion and to mortefie in them the wearines of the way, it was nothing
in respect to the pleasure of GONSALDO who beholdinge the beauty of his
mistres, resemblinge a far of, one of the NYMPHS affirmed by Ouide to attend
the gods DIANA goinge on huntinge, felt in himself a new increase or
supply of desire, in such sort, that if he had but the flea in his ear
before, it is now that he stands upon thorns, till he have given a charge
upon the pray which seames so pleasant of taste, and swearinge by the god of
his religion, not to lose the benefit of so sweat a morsel, began to encorage
his men to dispose them selves to perform the cause of their coming,
warninge them notwithstanding in special sort, to abstain from vyolence
against the maid, and albeit says he the father is unarmed of any weapon
sauinge his short woodknife, yet am I sewer, he will put himself in endeavor
to reskowe his daughter, wherefore whilst some are graplinge with the girl,
the rest may keep the old man occupied with terror and words of threatening
fear, wherwyth he cried to thassalte, when ymediatly thambushe discovered
them selves, and in a moment enuyroned the selly maid on al parts with their
swords drawn, offering to lay hands upon her, and carry her to their
master, the miserable parents saying them at point to depart with ye only
pillor and proppe of their old years, ymagyning thattempte to ymport an effect
of great mischief. retired to thordinarie arms and defenses of age, which
were pitiful cries which the villains appaised ymediatly with threats of
present death, if they would not cease their doleful brute, and for a more
terror to the sellie goldsmith, some of them held the point of his sword to
his throat, who notwithstanding kept his daughter fast in his arms, and the
mother would not be disseuered from her child, desieringe the traitors to
discharge their cruelty upon her and give her daughter the favor of a safe
liberty, but the more the desolate parents filled their ears with requests
of compassion the less pity appeared in the tyrants, and greater desire grew
in the rauynous Abbot: what heart cold refrain to distill drops of blood on
the behalf of the desolation of these three wretched creatures, the father out
of breathe and half dead, with the force of skrichinge cries, the mother
equal pertaker of his desaster, and exceeding her husband in sorrow, the maid
more assured then her parents in the conflicte of this misfortune, was at the
point to use force against her self, rather then to fall into the hands of
thexecucioners of her pudicitie: I am sewer never a Lady of you all, reading
this dollorous discourse, can abstain from terms of detestacion against the
infamous and disordered desire of this disciple of Satan, neither conceile
thargument of compassion saying the virginity of this maid hangyng by so
slender a fyllet, and ready to be offered by compulcion upon the alter of
filthy ymmolacion, to glot the lascivious thrust of this rauynous APOSTAT, who
masqued in a visorne and wede of simplicity, supported also by a coollour of
feigned devotion, studieth nothing, but to pray upon the honor of widows,
abuse the absence of the married man by corrupting his wife, and subborn by
inorderly means to seduce the chastetie of maids. But now to our PAROLYNA who
as she knew the cause of this Alaram to proceed of her only, and saying the
force of thassailantes had committed already her parents as it were into
sewer ward of their power, and finding with all an ympossibilitie in her self
to resist the strenghte of the rest, determined yet to supply the defense of
her honor with the benefit of a virtuous and valiant pollecie, wherefore
chaunginge in a moment the amazed glee of complexion in her face, into a regard
of assured joy, addressed her to thab bot with request, that before she
performed theffect of his desire, he would lend her his sword, for no other
intent, says she, but that my hands only may chasten the rigor of mine old
father, whose crabbed age, ignorante of civility, has been hitherunto
thonly ympediment and stay of my goodwill to yield you the hier and
consideracion of your love, assuringe His letter.
you that upon the receite of the first assurance of your affection toward
me, I got the consent of my mother, to be thankful in sort you required me,
and now if he should live, and witness the consomacion of both our desiers,
his contynuall complaints would procure grievous punishment of thoffence, to the
open slander of us both, wherewith tholde man gyuing undoubted credit to the
dyssymuled discourse of his daughter, the rather for that he noted no
difference in her countenance and famyliar conference to thabbot, cried out
against thiniquitie she used to his honest life passed, and present wrong she
did to the virtue of his hoarie years, and not knowing the meaning or mystery
of her policy, forgot no terms of reproach or rigorous rebuke against his
chaste daughter, of whose good will ^onsaldo being more then half assured,
both for the small regard she used, to the threatening words of her father,
and also the flattering terms of consent by her own mouth, no less glad of
the victory, then if he had already passed the offer of al perils, performed
the request of her, who desiered nothing less then the death of her father,
and life of thabbot, and putting his naked sword into the hand of the
coragious girl, offering withal to embrase her as though the conquest were
already performed, she flonge from him in great rage, willing him to retire,
as he made account of his life, for says she, thou counterfeit ypocryte, if
thou offer eftesones to lay thy rauenouse hands upon me, thine own sword
shall give the blow of deadlye vengaunce to the fatal course of thy cursed
days, whereupon she addressed her to her father half dead of a fret tinge
anger, and purging his collerike conceits against her, told him that he was
not the father of a daughter, that would not iustefie the glory of his life
passed with equal virtue, and much less further his death by thinfamous
renown of her life, neither do the thing either by accord or compulcion,
that should have power to sturr up the blodd of shame in his face, in what
company soever he came, But says she, the mighty hand of God restoringe
thy weak age to a doble strength, and me to a perfect skill in the use of
this sword which I have conqwered of our common enemy, shall defend our honor
against the force of these Rakehells, who seek to deprive me of the Jewel of
my reputacio^, wherewith she flourished here and there, bestowing her blows with
such skill to the disauantage of her enemy, that who had seen her desperate
dealing with the sword, would have judged, that she had been traded in the
only exercise of arms all the days of her life, which stroke such soddaine
courage and joy into the dead heart of her old father, that he aduowed his life
in the honest quarrel of his daughters chastetie, and likewise the careful
mother gave assistance to the magnaminitie of her child according to her
feeble force, which so occupied the place for a time, that tholde man and the
two ympes derived of the blodd of thancient AMAZONS, laid so hard to the
charge of the monk and his soldiers, that in one instant the whole ambush of
traitors was out of breathe. But GONSALDO knowing by this last deceit of the
maid that there was neither love nor friendly meaning in her, began to convert
his affection into an humor of fury, commaundinge the sword to be taken out of
the hands of the new champian, with express charge notwithstanding to use no
violence against her, wherwyth the medley grew ymediatlye so hoate on both
sides, that the Father to defend the honor of his daughter, used no care to
his own sauegard: and the daughter to prevent the violence of her body was
desperate of her life, the Abbot on ^hother side saying there was no way to
prevent his peril but by the overthrow of his enemies, gave end to the
conflict by thextremitie of force, leauinge the aged parents on grownde maimed
and half dead with the number of mortal wounds, but the daughter lightly
hurt in the arm, saying that the want of strength would yield her prisoner at
last to the enemy of her honor, thinkinge nothing less notwithstanding then
to satisfy his desire any way then by her death, used the benefit of her
fortune, and at unawares reached GONSAL DO a great blow thwarte the face,
making a blodie podell or bayne for flees in the summer upon the nose of
master Abbot, wherewith holdinge the point of her sword in her hand cryinge
upon thaide of thalmightie, to whom according to the shortness of her time she
commended the health of her soul, she leapte from above the bridge into the
cristal waves of the clear Zebete, chosing rather to build her tomb within
the bellye of some fyshe or monster of the sea, then to yield a forcible
offering of the first fruits of her virginity to the polluted image or ydoll
of the Synagoge of babylon, but God not willinge as yet to deprive the world
of so rare a mirror of virtue, gave her such force against the rage of the
stream, that she kept breath, til certain passengers leaping into the river,
recovered her with diligence of swymminge, and brought her on live to the
shore, deserving better the benefit of longer life, then the papistical
monk, who seeing the end and success of his enterprise, retired into his
Abbaie with his skorched face, without showing himself any more in the streets
of NAPLES upon his sturring Iennetts for the love of his lady.

The parents and the maid after they were a little refreshed and restored to
their senses in ye field, were carried to ye Town, where every man, wondringe
indifferently at their virtue and valyantnes in so great a peril, gave special
commendacion, to the chastetie of Parolyna, for that she desiered rather to die
in the devouring flodd, then to burn quike in the skor chynge flames and fire
of whoredom, where unto the wickedness of the Abbot had almost brought her.

And sewer it is to such maids, to whom we ought to erect pillars, and grave
their virtue in monumentes of eternity, and not to a company of imperfect
and folishe women, who besides their beauty, had never any thing worthy of
commendacion. For the respect of whose weakness, I have chiefly preferred this
discourse, wherein as they may note in this Parolyna, an act no less
valiant, then in the most assured soldiour that ever bare arms, so they
ought to forbear to glorifye them selves in the glory of her chastetye, and
by studying to ymitate her virtue, to leave no force unproven, which may serve
to guard the honor and renown of their name, and conquer the wanton delytes of
the frail flesh, assuringe them selves, that god ympartes a wonder full
strength and constancy of mind to such as be chaste in deed, and the virtue of
whom consists not only in thoutwarde arguments, but is sewerly ram pierd
within the strongest part of their heart: like as in the mind of this, to whom
as you see, thalmighty gave force to vanquishe with main hand, the wicked
enemy of her honor.

FINIS.
The argument
IF the wisemen of old time found cause of cohibicion in their unruly

daughters and little girls, being yet in the first flame of the fire which

chayned in the bottom of a dark prison, then to enjoy the benefit of the open

THE DISORDERED LIFE of the countess of Celant, who living long in adultery,
and after she had procured diverse morders, received the hier of her wickedness
by a shameful death.
IN thuttermoste parts of Pyemount, is a percell of thinheritaunce of the
Marquis mountferrat called CASALIA, where dwelte sometime one James Scarpadon,

grecian damefell of equal quality and calibre, begat of her a dought ter more

golden coffers) renownced nature and dyed, bequeathing a portion of a hundredth
thowsande dockattes, to his young daughter Blanch maria, who dismissing the
age of infancy, according to thordynarye course of times, seamed sooner ripe
in years, then confirmed in discrecion, or hable to admit the order of good
government: for goinge on the.xvi. year of her age, albeit her doings were
not voied of diverse arguments of bad disposicion, yet the respect of her
beauty, with thintisinge desire of her large portion, forced several
importunities in sundry noble men and princes of the country, in such forte, as

Viscount Hermes, son and heir of Bla^che maria married to the Viscount hermes.
the thyefest house in MYLLAN, who incontinent after the marriage, carried her in
great pompp to his house, leauinge her mother to traffyque thaffaires of her

This Viscount after he had practiced a while thinclinacion of his wife, whom
he noted more arguments of wanton and vnseamelye glees, with a desyer of

a more skoape of liberty, then the rest of the Ladies in any part in Italy,
having by custume (as yt were) certain days in the week of intercourse and
meetinge together, yet thindeuour of this viscount, brought his wife not only
in contempt with such assemblies, but also to disclaim all gossoppes trade or
other fellow ship, saving such as she found in the house of her husband,
from whose presence she departed not For any intreatye whatsoever: wherewith,
her companions and Ladies of the city, fyndyng a lack of her company fearing
withal, that the continuance of such precedent, would in time prevail above

Sforce, who broakinge one day with Seigneur Hermes of other affairs, asked
him why he kept his wife so short, with advise in the end, that he would
slack somwat the bridle of his rigor, and enjoin her a longer line or
compass of liberty, least the world entered into moormure against him, with
ymaginacion that he either doated of her beauty, or had her honesty in doubt,
for (says she) kepinge her in this strait mewe, you bring her fragilitie in
question, and wynneth to your self the title of a Jelouse husband. He answered
her breef demand with terms of as short discourse, observing
notwithstanding the condition of his own estate, and quality of her that
propouned the question. There is no man (good madam, (says he) that The wise

is privileged from hearing such things as are not true, for such as are
vainelie occupied in disputinge at large upon my doings, are ignorant of the
cause, and much less know they the disposicion of my wife, whom I had rather
keep captif in seamclie order, then in gyuynge leave to her liberty, to
procure her dishonor, and myself just infamye, he that will keep the thing
peculyar to himself which is desired of many, must neither offer yt to the
sale, nor suffer yt to be seen but seldom: And as yt is only I that am pryuye
to mine own greef, so I am not ignorant of a medecyne to restore the disease,
neither am I voyed of discretion to govern in good sort, the humors of my
young wife, nor at what times I should let flyppe the rain that restraynes
the further lybertye you seame to require. But where you charge me with a dowte
of her honestye, blame me not if I seek to prevent that which I would not
should happen, and to avoid thimputacion of Ialousye, I am content that
hensfurthe she come to your house, when and as often and, at such hours, as yt
shall like you to desyer her company, being persuaded that the rank and
reputation you hold, will not broke other society or felowshyppe, then such
as aggree every way with your gravity and virtue, which only shall be her
skoape, with such other recreacion and pleasure as she fyndes in my house, to
the common contentement and mutual tranquilletie of us both: for the rest, I
wyshe all importunities to cease, least they wrest me to a further rigor,
for as I am hethervnto fullye persuaded of her honesty, so I account yt a
wisdom to forsee, that the use of to much liberty, do not corrupt that,
which as yet is without spot: wherein treulie he had great reason, and his
precedent or example most worthy of ymitacion, to such as are in like state
touching the government of their wives, for to that kind of cattall, albeit
for diverse respects we ought to forbear to minister thextremetye of rigor,

our selves worthy of thauthoritie given us by God and nature, in exposynge the

His prophecy also seamed fully verefyed in the sequeile of the licenceous

being lady over all, and subject to the controlement of none, she took such
a sewer taste, and Sypped so strongelie on the cup of licenceous liberty, that
yt bredd in her an insatiable thirst of wanton and dissolute life, as you
shall hear hereafter: for her chief and common exercise there, was, to force a
frizilacion of her hair, with the bodkind, converting the natural coollour in
to a glistering glee suborned by art, to abuse God and nature, by alteringe
the complexion of her face by a dye of fadinge coollours devised by pollecye,

at her gate as a stale, to allure a stay of such as passed by the streets,
there was no offer made, which she did not admit, no request preferred, which
she did not willyngelye hear, nor letter sent, which she did not receive and
answer. This was the first earneste penny and foundation of her licencious

omitting no means to advance their service, and make them meritorious of her

remorce and slender compassion which hitherto have appeared in you, do argue a
great wrong on your part, touching the justice of my cause, seeing you have not
only denied pity toward my sodry passions, but also made none account any way
of the loyal and honest love I bear you, for yt you would never allow nor

break thinstinct which nature has given him, not only to doubt of the
honesty of his wife, be she never so virtuous, but also to keep her so short

common brute of the world, if not, that thonly awe and fear of the Lady
Marquess, has forced you, to mary her son in law, neither will they have

suffringe your self, not only to be governed, but also forced by such as
have no reason to rule you, nor authority to command you, which title, with
his sequeile of a thousand inco^ueniences and annoyes, as I wish you to
eschew chiefly for the respect of your own contentemit and quiett of life, so

embrace the gift of a better time, and ymagyn that fortune has here sent her
messenger, not only to present you with an offer of preset pleasure, but also
an assured warrante and confirmacion of continual contentement, even until
thextreme day and date of your life, wherein for my part, being void of

behalf, preferrynge unto you, a consideracion of the long and honest love I
have borne you, sommoning your conscience also by justice, not to be
unthankful in the guerdon of so due a meritt. You know my estate is void of
necessetie, or lack of any welthe, neither are you ignorant (I am sewer) of my
large power and possession in Scauoye, both which as I hope, will defend me
from charge or note of couetuse desyer, in sekyng the grant of your favor,
so I lay them also before you, as witnesses, to aduouche thusmuche further on
my behalf, that thonlye respect of your beauty, with other gifts of rare
consequence in you, have sturred up my affection, with desyer to do you
service, and crave good will in sort of honest and lawful marriage: and Albeit
I could yet have thassystance of a thousand other reasons to iustyfie
thusmuche of me, yet reapposing much for my self in thintegretie of my cause,
I commend unto you the present view of an unfeigned experience, and commit my
self wholly to thindifferencie of your judgment: for if my passion were not
vehement, and my torment continual without comparaison, or if my request had
neither reason nor justice on his side, I had but right, if I were returned;
with a repulse of my dissembled suit, and receive the due hyer of a deceitful
mind: but seeing my demand stands upon terms of simplicity, and voyed of
treason, importinge an unfeigned effect, semblable to the dollorous regardes of
my complerion, and seeing withal I come accompanied with sincerity, and undoubted
intent of honest dealing, and that I cannot take day with my passion, but by
the consent of your good will, regard I beseech you the merit of my faith, and
measure the meede according to thequitie of my deserte, resolve an equal
difference (good madam) between the deserte of him, that under the veil of the
power and authoritis of an other, does seek to conquer your good will, with
intent to keep you in continual captivity, and the just merit of me, who
respectyng only your beauty and virtue, has vowed mine honor and life to the
continual contemplacion of the same, with this further vow to live and dye
the servant and slave of the least of your commandments, let the vehemence of
my affection, with the vow and intent of unfeigned loyalty, precure you but to
a just remorse and indiffrent consideracion of me, regard (I beseech you)
thembassadour, which is love himself, who (in conuertinge mine ancient
liberty into a present captivity and awe of your beauty,) has forced also
such a vehemency of zeal in me, that if my cause return with an effect
contrary to the hope which hitherto has only preserved me, you will come to
too late a repentance of your cruelty, and by my death shall be witnessed

with the natural Ialousie of al Italians, seamed not only to mislike of her

she was almost as loath to offend her, as displease her self, yet she had not
engaged her liberty so far, but she reserved one point to stand her self in
stead, what need so ever she had, for in the choice of our husbands (says
she) we ought to respect a fre will and consent of our selves, and not to
observe thappetite of an other, or constrained thereunto by strangers, seeing
that as thinstitucion of god does give them unto us for companions without
seperacion, so yt is our parts to consider at large, before we resolve of the
choice, to the end that in breakyng so holy a ceremony, we seame not unworthy
of so sacred and high a participacion. But for my part (sir) if yt were not to
avoid the grudge of suspicion in the wicked sort, with the pertiall and
poisoned babble of malicius tounges, I assure you, I would live without a
second assaye of the curtesye of an other husband, protestinge unto you with
unfeigned vow that if I thought, that he whom my destenies have reserved for my
next consorte would represent, either in quality or condition, circunstance
or effect, the doings of him that is dead the bale should be broken from
thinstant, and the bargain revoked, what earnest or assurance so ever is given
of it. I thank you for your advertisement, with treble tribute, for the honor
you do me in desyeringe a composicion of marriage between us, promissing you, in
simple consideracion of the same, with the small deceit and dissembled traison
I note in you, the francke and free preferment of my marriage, if I happen to
dispose my self that way, with addicion of further power over the Lady
Blanch Maria, then any one in the world, whereof you may make as assured
account, as if the proff had alredie confirmed my words.

remembrance of your plages passed, gives you reason to fear the fall of future

not redownde but to your honor and contenteme^t? assure me by the breath of
your own month, of the faith and loyaltye of marriage, and you shall see me
purseue the end and work it to effect, without offense or displeasure of
any: if ye fear of the lady marquess restrain your consent, I think you do
wrong to the chief virtues whereof she is renoumed, for you must imagyne, that
she will not become such a tyranness over the will of her subjects, as to
co^straine the ladies of her land, to marie against their minds, and much
less force that, which god has left in liberty to all sorts, wherewith
beholdinge an alteracion of complexion in her face, with a general astonishme^t

wherwyth the widow: fearing to fall eftsoon into servitude, and fully persuaded
of the large offer of liberty promised by the earl, was not hable to answer
his ymportunities in other sort, then with a frank consent of her faith, with
a confirmacion by word and oath, which likewise he aduowched for his part, by
semblable ceremonies according to thorder of contractes, wherein for a more
assurance of the knot, and because the cord should not break, they wrastled a
fall, the one a loft of the other in witness of the bargayne.

This first earnest pennye or pleasante encownter of therle, procured him to
continue his hawnte, with more open and familyar access then affore, in such
sort, as fame discovered ymediatly their secret consentes, which also the
common brute brought to the ears of the Lady marquess, who notwithstanding
she had just cause of angry conceit against the widow, yet the respect of
therle, and regard to her own honor, kept her from any intent of reueng, but
swallowing a pil of patience rather by force, then order of due disgestion,
disposed herself, also to appease the Lord GONSAGA, who repeating in his

God thanks for his happy delyuerie from so inconstante a creature, wherein he
grieved also on the behalf of thinfortunat earl, that had planted his affection
in so pestilent a soil, exposing even now manifest likelyhodes, of the
dissolucion of the delight he seamed to take in his new consort and wanto^ wife,
lamenting more his rashenes in thenterprise, then allowing his wisdom in the
choice, for that according to the lattyne adage, he that uses more haste in
thexecucion, then council or devise in consulting of his busynes, shall lack
no time to repent his rashness, nor leisure to do penance for his folly, and
he that in che choice of his wife, has more respect to her flattering beauty,
then gifts of true virtue, shall easily be weary of pleasure, and hardly
enjoy a contynuall quiet of mind, the want whereof houered even now to
ouerwhelme this fond earl, who after publication of the marriage, retired with
his wife, to his house amongst ye mountains and craggie hills of Scauoye,
where he began to take council of his present affairs, for that Syftynge
somewhat nearelye the disposicion of his wife, he found her attyred wholly in
the apparel of wanton liberty, and more apt to follow thinclinacion of
vain and lascivious desyer, then disposed to make a stay of her self in the
trade of honest virtue, wherefore he accounted it an act of wisdom, to take
up the vain that fedd those humors, and stop her course before she gained the
plain feelde, wherein albeit he used so steadie a hand in the dyot of so
dangerous a creature, ministrynge the remedy with the consent of such
convenient times, and means, and in order of such simplicitye and gentle
dealyng, that she had no great cause to note him of discurtesie, yet she
became very waspishe in that he was so priuye to her disposicion, and forgot
so soon the large pryuilege of the lybertye which he had promised her,
reprehendynge with bitter terms, the general infidelytie of men, with
peculyar exclamacion against thiniquitye or her fortune, for that, she had
refused the preferment of the Lady Marquess, and promise of marriage with
Seigneur Gonsaga, exchaungyng diverse and sundry offers of honor and liberty,
for an yrkesome trade of servile life, with habitacion amongst the wild
deserts, and barraine seeldes of Sauoye, not forgettyng to reproach her
husband with diverse words of spite and disdain, assuring him for end, that
she would not remeine long coyffed and kept at commandment like a child that
is appointed his times to study, and hours for recreacion. But therle neither
ignorant in the sollies of women, nor void of experience to practice such
kind of creatures, preferred a wounderful patience, as his chiefest remedy
against the rage of his wife, laying before her notwithstanding in gentle
terms, the duty and endeavor of a wife toward her husband, how much (and in
what sort she ought to respect the honor of her self, and reputacion of
marriage, and that as no woman ought to putt in interest her honor or honest
name, so the greater she is in degree, the more heinous is her offense, and a
small fault of a great Lady, is most mortal in the eye of ye multitude, who

to confirm the perfect renown of a gentlewoman, if the words and outewarde
hehauior of the body do not follow thinwarde virtue of the heart, and
thordynarye hawnte and exercise, give manifest declaracion of that which lies
hyd in the secrets of the stomach, and for my part I would be loathe to give
you cause of miscontentement, seeing that in the reapose of you, consistes the
rest of my self, and you being out of quiett, I can not escape without
greeff, seeing that as the mutual consent of our wills and affections, with
the like conjunction of marriage, has made you the one half and second part of
my self, so I exspect at your hands only a simple accomplishement of that,
which your public oath affore God and man in the church has bound you unto,
like as also I am ready to perform unto you thuttermost of any promise or
privilege, where of at any time, I have made protestacion, with full assurance
from this present of every part of the same, so that you give me the due
respect of a husband, for as the head being the chief and principal part of
the rest of the members, has (as yt were) a special authority by nature, to
govern the whole mass and remeynder of the body, so the woman, being
thinferior part of her husband, is subject to all dutiful obedience on his
behalf, and bound to honor him with no worse terms, then by the name of
Lord and master, for in omitting your duty toward him, you abuse the virtue
of your vow, approved by sollemne oath, and in ince^sing his dishonor, you are
gu^ltie of the violacion and breach of wedlock: one chief ouersighte I note
in you is, for that upon small causes, you fordge great complaints, which
argues the rather the ydlenes of your brain, for the mind that is occupied
with vanitye, is forgettfull of all things, saving such as thynstygacion of
pleasure and folly, do prefer to her remembrance, where on the contrary
part, the sprite affected to virtue, exposes always ^rutes according to so
great a gift, dissimuling her passions, with words of wisdom, and in
knowing-much, gives not withstanding a show of an honest and moderate
ignorance, and she that laboreth in a passion of particular co^ceites, with
detestacion of the due respect of honor, can not study other works, then
such as seame to favor her follye, nor open her ears to any voice, if the same
agree not to the co^plot and co^tentement of her fancy, wherein as I hope, you
will, either pardon me by justice, or at least excuse my simplicity, for that,
as you late terms of reproach have forced me to such a plains, so for end,
if you will renounce your trade of former folly, and fromhen^^urth retire to an
orderly confirmitie of life, you shall not only procure a singler pleasure to
me, but cause an absolute contentement with continual quiet to your self,
whereof be careful as you think good. Here the earl had great reason and

to reform thabuses in his wif without thassistance of cruelty or constraint,
for that such disposicions are rather reduced by fair intreaity, then
reclaimed by fear or force of torments, according to the nature of diverse of
thinsensible creatures, for the fierce Elephant stands not in awe of his
keaper by force of any stripes, but is made tractable to bend his lardge body

of his keeper, wherewith he ouercometh the natural rudenes and cruelty of the
beast: The Tygre will take food at the hands of the wildman norished in the

women, albeyt they are quite deuested of all honor or honesty, yet are they
found to retain some sparks of civil humanity, being more easelye brought
to a reformacion by gentle order, then reclaimed by the smart of any torture or
cruelty, wherein not withstanding this countess seamed to use a more
extremety, and excede ye doings of any that ever have been noted of disorder
that way, for neither gentle perswacions cold allure her, nor fear nor force
reduce her to reconcilement, or amendment of life, but according to the stone
of Scylicia, upon whom, the more you beat, to bruise or break yt in pieces,
the greater hardness is driven into it, so the greater endeavor therle used to
persuade his wife, either by allurement or offer of correction, the more
peruersatie he found in ber, with less hope of amendment, and as she used a
malicious scilence during the discourse of his exhor^acion, so she forced in
her self for the present, a wounderfull patience, to thend that with the
consent of a more convenient time, she might spitt out the poison which she
shrouded secretly under the wynge of her venomous stomach, whereby for a first
proof of her conninge in the part she mente to play, she forgot not to
dissimule her passion, and conterfet the simple ypocrate in such sort, as a
wiser man then therle, might easelye have been taken in the snare of her
deceit, which notwithstanding she used in such covert manner, that within
short time, she had not only removed al conceits of evil from the head of
her husband, but also brought him to an opinion of a maruelons honesty and
assured confidence in her, in which good vain, and for a more declaracion of
his good mind toward her, he observed her fancy so farfurth, as upon a
soddaine he brake up house in Scauoye, and went to Casaliae, where lay her
inheritance and chief possession.

If you mark well the fetch of this woman, in procuring her husband to depart
his country, and what a sudden check followed to him, with a false bound to ye
honor of her self, you may easily judge, that a woman once bent, and resolved
to do evil, has a wit to ymagine al malice, and sorts of mischief to be
ministers in therecucion of her wickedness, and that neither fear of
punishment, imputacion of shame, peril nor danger, how mortal so ever they
appear, can stay her from performing the end of her dampnable devise, whereof
the tragedy of MEDEA, and folly of the friend of Theseus argues sufficiently

to do things contrary to all honesty, neither does the Egle soaring in the
air, conueighe her self to so high a gate, by the force and ^leight of her
wings, as the vain conceits and ymaginacions of a woman gouernedby her own
opinion, fills her full of devises of iniquity, with desire and means to
perform the^fe^t of any evil, wherein as I touch only such as having made
open sale of their honor, are not worthy eftesoones to challenge their place
amongst the society of chaste and verteous dames, so I hope the same is
sufficient to procure my excuse amongst the crewe of honest Ladies and
gentlewomen, the rather for that the publicacio^ and de^yphering of the just
infamye of the corrupted sort, gives a greater show of your glory, and makes
your honor and virtue of more reputacion, neither would I be noted in this
place of malice, to move question of theime, whose lives and doings every
way are full of integretie, nor use any pertiall adulacion or flutterie on the
behalf of such, as be notorius of evil in the eye of all the world, but in
making an indiffrent division of the deserts of every degree, to give to either
sort his peculiar title, neither conceiling the corrupcion and villainy of the
one, nor carping the virtue and just renown of the other, whereof I leave the
judgment, and my excuse in balance amongst you chaste dames, who I am sewer

quiet and contenteme^t, during the remeinder or rest of his age. He that is
assured (says he) of the malice of his enemy, has small cause to fear his

a mortal enemy, in thabite and attire of an assured friend, and trustyng to

(no doubt) would not only have slau^dered my bed, with unlawful adultery, but
indefiling her hands with my blood, would one day have made no conscience to

Ytalye, then the Corynthyan lays through all parts of Asya, being withal so
prodigal of her liberty, with open and vnseamelye means, to make her self
known to the world, that in the very view and first beginning of her
trade, appeared infallible arguments of future evils with a disordered sequeile
of life. Albeit she seamed to reserve a certain majesty and semblance of
respect to her estate, for that she would not march, but under enseignes of
nobility, refusing either to be seen or spoken to, of persons of meaner
condition, which delicate and coye order, she seamed to prefer, rather to set
a greater price of her merchandise, according to the Grecian curtisan, whom the
orator refused Demosthenes refused the company of Lays, for that she held a

for that he would not buy his repentance at so high a rate, then to argue
any diminution of her lascinius desyer, for her eye had no sooner encountered
any young and lusty Gentleman, that seamed sufficiently set furthe with
furniture of nature, and hable every way to perform the exspectation of her
appetitte, but her countenance and other outward behavior, were ready to
make declaracion of her inward desyer, roauyng upon him without respect, with
such glee and liberal regardes, that he need no interpretor to decipher her
meaning, nor physician to disclose the mystery of her disease, neither was
she any thing inferior to Madona Mussalina the Roman Princess, saving that
she haunted the bank and common places, and this performed her exploites in
her own house, the Roman put no difference between Carters and men of
greater calling, and this Demygreque prayed only upon nobilitye and ympes of
tender years, wherein albeit she seamed more delicate of taste then the other,
yet she exceded all the Bancrowtes of honor that ever were, in this one point,
that she was always rather weary of travel, then at any time satisfied with
pleasure, resembling a bottomless goolphe, receyuinge all that is putt into it,
without casting any thing up again: this was the chaste life, which this
good Lady ledd after she had got the bit between her teeth, and the rain of
liberty within her own hand, whereby you may judge, whether the Myllanoyse
or first husband had raison to refrain her forward inclinacion in the first
flame of her youth, saying that as the green ozier or sallow of ij. or iij.
years groth, is always more pliable then the great oak, seasoned either by
pollecie or confirmed in hardness by the continuance of many years, so it is
necessary we keep an awful hand upon such youngelynges, as appear sooner
ripe in appetit, then in government or discrecion, to the end that in plyeng
the wax whilst the water is warm, we may always frame them to the posteye
of our minds, having them to supply the necessitye of our affairs. And as
the conning grafter forseing the destruction of his stock, by the tomuche
forwardnes of the twigges, and certain little hraunches, sukyng up the moisture
and sapp, which should feed the rest of the tree, does cut them away, to
the end the principal bows may florishe, and receive their natural
norriture, so it is not sufficient to minister correction to youth in their
tender years, if we reserve not a continuation of awe, to accompany their
increase and ripenes of their age, to prevent the harms we see ordinarilye
happen by maturitye and to much forwardnes in desyer to be free from
controlment.

the stranger to a more desyer to behold her, she would sometime appear in

the earl made his walk that way, who being already gaulled with the arrows
of love on her behalf, pursewed his queste with such devotion and diligence,
that he conquered at last a convenient time and mean to speak to her, wherein
albeit he preferred but a simple proffer of his service, with other slight
discourses, wherwyth the courtyar or other gentleman of behauyor does commonly
feed the time, whilist he is in the company of ladies, and that the great

subtle countess, albeit she knew well enough that the fire was not so kindled
in the stomach of therle, as it pleased him to set a face and feigned show of
his passion, and that the large skoape of liberty in his tongue, with
assurance and constancy in his countenance, argued rather a dissembled zeal,
then a true transport of affection in his heart, yet seeing him young, Iustie,
and sufficient every way, to aunswers and discharge the combat of her gredie
desyer, determined not to let slip the offer of so fytt a pray, which
she thought would suffyce, to occupye the place, till she had fonnde an

grant of her favor under these couerte terms: like as Signeur Valpergo She
grants favor to therle.
I am not ignorant in thordinarie deceites of men, declared specially on the
behalf of such, as reapposinge to much credit in their honesty, do give
slender guard of theimselues, so I can (I thank god) content my self to
smile at their follies, and take pleasante recreacion to hear the bravery of
their requests, seaming to burn in the desires of love, when in deed they are
not only far from such passion, but free from intent to perform any effect of
true loyalty, seaminge also to enterlarde their ymportunities with a doble
vehemencye, when they go most busilye abowte to make a pray of our beauty and
fragilitie, whereof albeit I account you not only one of the number, but also
no less desloyall then any of the rest, yet respectinge the reputacion of your
race, I am content to give credit to your words, and accept your offer in such
sort as you have promised, reapposing so much for my self in your
discrecion, that there shall appear in you no want of any thing that belongs
to the government and wise conueigh of such secret affairs, wherein if I fid an
effect of my exspectacio^, your self shall judge of my liberality, in retorning

dismiss all further delays, and dispose himself to thexecution of the thing
so indiffrentlie desyered of them both, put diligence to the thankful offer
of time and fortune, in such sort, as embrasinge her with a thowsande sorts
of kysses, he forgatt all ceremonies and circumstaunces, and gave her
checkmatt without any odds, upon a low bed or pallet covered cloase with
a veil or canapie of crymosyne velvet, frindged with silver thrombe, where was
such indiffrente likinge on both parts, that they resolved at thinstaute of
other times and hours to meet at the shocke in so pleasant a skirmishe,
wherein as she judged him hable enough to pass ye moosters for such respects,
determyninge to make stoare of him, till fortune furnished her of a fresh
supply, so for his part, he found her so delicate on his behalf, that he
resigned than thoritie which earste governed him and his doings, to the order
and derection of her, in such sort, as he spoke nothing but by the mouth of
Blanch Marya, nor did any thing wherein her council and commandment bare not
the greatest swaighe, being so drowned in the desyer of his beastelie trol, and
blinded with the veil of filthy love, that both day and night were indiffrent

delicate arms his place of pleasante exercise and trial of actiuitie, with
contynual aboade there, and that with such public signs and declaracion of
his diseordered lyuinge, that to the comfirmacion of the common brute which
passed of their follies, there lacked but some PLAVTVS or TERENCE, to prefer it
in public stage, in the hearing of all the world. But what? is it like, that
she that had falsed her faith to a husband, more honest and virtuous then
she deserved, would content herself with the company of this young earl, or
who doubts, but such indiffrent women, as have committed their bodies to the
general service of the world, are no less inconstante in their love, then
void of shame, in deuestinge them of honest virtue, to undertake so badd a

flickering glance of her uncertain eye, but she felt a mocio^ of vehement zeal

such certain affection, that she which earste had dalyed with all men,
becomes now to doat upon this new earl, and that in such sort, that if
fortune would not award present compassion, and love lend her a spedie mean to
recover thobiect of her desire, she seamed not only to enter the torments of
despair, but also to make small account of the use of longer life, judging by
thexterior and outewarde promises of this young Lord, that it was only he,
that seamed sufficient to quench the thirst of her greedy appetit, wherefore
she began to dispatche her hands of her first friend Valpergo, with whom from
that instant, she did not only refuse to speak, but also shonninge all places
of his presence and repair, would not stick sometime to shot her gates
against him, which he cold not digest without certain injurious words and
terms of reproach, whereupon she grounded a grudge of such mortal enimitie
and spite, against him, that her mind retained a remembrance of the quarrel,
till her malice had procured his death, whereof the discourse follows in his
place, desiering (as yt seamed) thacquainta^ce of therle Gainzo, as well for her
assistance in thexcucion of theffect of her present spite, against Valpergo, as
for the respect of true affection, wherein as she was whoattlye called upon by
ij. earnest solicitours, love, and revenge, the one sewinge for a consommacion
of her wicked devise, the other prickyng her with desire to procure theffect of
her new affection with the second earl, to whom albeyt she displayed such
manyfeste signs of good will, as either the art of love could imagyne, or
her wanton and idle brain devise, yet seeing so slender a replye on his part,
with an increase of her burning appetite, she thought it necessary to put
spurs to his dull disposicion, making no conscience to become the shameless
clyent in a cause, wherein the most vile and simple woman that is, suffers her
self to be sewed unto with no small adoo, wherein being void of means to
use mutual conference, she makes this little letter the messenger of her
vnseamelie request.

The respect of the place and estimacion which I hold (sir) I am sewer will
putt you in some amaze at the first The countess vvoeth therle Gaiazo by
letter.
view of these lines and undoubted messengers of my heart, seeing, that in
preferring the lewd suggestio^ of my unruly fancy, before the due regard and
consideracion of modesty, which ought to accompany all Ladies of honor, I
make request of that, whose simple remembrance, makes me blushe at so great
an abuse: But if you consider the commission of love, who sommoneth rather by
commandment, then request, with such a general awe over all estates, and
peculiar authority to punish us women with vehemencye of affection, in
desyeringe the things, which nature has forbidden us to attempt, you will
not only dispense with my rash follye, but dispose your self to take away,
or at least diminish, the greatness of my present passion, which as it was
founded at first, upon the general fame of your virtues, so the often view
of your rare perfection of person since your repair to Pauya, has forced
such an increase of zeal, with aggrauacion of my desyer, that if my destenie
deny me a spedye supplye of relief, or fortune forbide you to come and visitt
my longyng estate, your crueltye shall mortifye my passion, and give end to my
life together, wherein, saying love has favored you with the victory and
conqueste of her, who earste had power to vanquishe all men, show your self
no less willing to embrace the benefytt, then worthy of the glory, and
deferr not (sir) to expose effects of pity on the behalf of her, who lives
only under the mercy of a simple hope, which if the return of your
resolucion do make frustrate, and convert my desyer into air, the same shall
also pronounce the fatal end of the unhappy, and your most loyal. Blanch
Maria.

This embassage, with further commission by the mouth of the bringer, sturred
up no small alteracion in the mind of the young earl, chieflye for that he
saw himself pursued with a frank offer of that, which (if the affectioned
zeal he bare to his dear friend and companion the Lord Valpergo, had not
stayed thattempte) he had soughts long since to obtain. And albeit he judged
it neither tolerable by humanity, nor thoffice of a gentleman, to supplant
the pleasure of his friend, and march in the steps of his pray, yet being
charmed (as it were) with the vehement words of the letter, with opinion that
the discurtesie were to great, to abuse the liberal offer of so fair a Lady,
gave place to the sommonce and went immediatlye to her house, where finding
her voyede of all company in her bed chamber, saw small occasion to prefer
half the circumstance and courtlike wooing, wiche Seigneur Valpergo used, for
that both the one and the other, after certain intisinge kisses, and other
drawyng allurements performed on both parts, disposed themselves tomake
present sacrifyce to the goddess of love, in putting an effect to the thing
which they both thirsted to accomplish with equalitye of desyer, which amarous
practice continued between them certain months, in such sort, that therle
was so assotted, and became so ydolatrous on her behalf, that he performed no
devotion to other saint, saving the vnseamely shryne of his new mynion, who
also seeing him stand in water to the chin, and wholly subject to the yoke of
her awe, determined to keep a hard hand of the bridle, with intent to make
him the bloddye executioner of her detestable devise against her former lover
Valpergo, whose felicity defended him either from the peril of that
imaginacion, or else God would not yet give leave to her wickedness, for that her
hope was deceived touching any help or assistance of her new friend, for
Valpergo seeing himself not only dispossessed of the love of his Lady, but
dishonored by her mouth with diverse words of reproach in his absence, judged
it no grudge of conscience to mynister semblable revenge on her behalf, the
rather for that she was both the author of the evil, evil, first breaker of
her faith without cause, and now the begyner of the quarrel of slander,
wherefore departing from PAVIA, he painted her dishonestie upon every post
he passed by, blasynge her arms, with such base and vile coollours, and in
such liberal sort, that every company which he haunted was pertaker of
the renown he gave to Blanch Marya, who hearing at last, what estymacion
she was in through all LOMBARDIE, by the reapport of VALPERGO, began to enter
into terms of rage, finding a great difficulty to dysgeste thyngratitude
of her lost lover, whose doings notwithstanding she allowed some times by
justice, and saw some reason in his revenge, for that her inorderlie dealing
opened the first way to his discurtesie, and by and by flattered her self,
with a vain ymagynacion, that men were borne to bear what ymposicions so
ever such tryflors as she would lay upon theyme, and that seeing they were
but servants, they did but right to endure and take in good part any thing
said or don by their mistres, albeyt feeding still of her malicious collar,
with a certain secret desyer of vengance determined at last to return his
discourtesye with no less interest then the loss of his life, with resolucion
to procure the spedy effect by the hand of him, whom she presumed to have so
much at commandment, that a simple request of her mouth would make him
the minister of that.

Behold with what ympudentie, and ragethys Tygresse goth abowte, to arm one
friend against an other, and that yt could not suffice to abuse her self
toward them both, in the filthy use of her body, but that with intent to
morder the one, she puttes in hazard the equal destruction of them both,
confirmynge her abhomynable adulterye, with manslaughter and wyllfull morder, a
sin most heinous of all other affore GOD and manne, wherein as Morder most
ha^nous in the sight of god
her fretting mind cold admit neither quiett nor contenteme^t, til her eyes
were witnesses of theffect of her devise or, at least she had put her intent
upon terms to him, whom she meant to make the bloddie boocher of her beastely
will, so, attendynge the offer of convenient time and place, she was assisted
at last so farfurth, that one night as they were in bed together, and in the
chiefest delight of their pleasant exercise, she burste soddainly into vehement
tears, with sighs and other signs of dollour in such sort, that with the
counterfaite alarams which inward sorrow seamed to minister and set a
broache, her passion appeared so mortal, that her ignorant bedfelowe,
thinking her soul and body to be at point to make present seperacion, the
one from the other, enquired the cause of her grefe, with addicion yt if yt
came by displeasure or wrong don to her by any man, his hands only should
give the revenge with absolute contentement to her self hereafter, wherewyth
using the advantage of his promise, wherein she accounted a sufficiency to
procure the end of her enemy, told him, that She entreats her second friend
to kill her first lover.
as nature had given a certain facility to the vile and base sort of people,
to bear and brook the offer of any injury, so there was nothing more
contrary to the condition of the noble mind, then to be touched with such
villainy as puttes the honor in interest, or the renown upon terms of
public infamy: I say thusmuche (sir) says she, weeting his face with the
dew of her waterie eyes, for that the Lord Valpergo, who enjoyed, I can not
deny, the like frendshypp I show unto you, has not had shame to blab of his
doings, slaundring me with no worse terms of infamye, then if I were the
most infected strompett that ever abandoned her body to the Marynors and
rascal crewe, alonge the costs of SCICILE: if he had but made a simple vaunte
of the favors he found in me, with participacion but to his friends, my honor
had been but in question, where now it is past all doubt, besides if he had
not added iniurius words, to his indecent slander, and made a common market
tale of the thing which ought to be kept most secret, I could have disgested
the evil with an ordynarye patience, wherefore saying the heinous causes of my
grief, import a special justice and reason of revenge, let not the enemy of
the honor of your dear Blanch Marya, escape without punishment, but in
accomptynge the wrong which I sustain, indifferent to us both, to bind me
(by the benefytt of this revenge) to a more affeccioned zeal toward you,
with an assured loyaltye even until thextreme dissolucion of my natural
days, otherwise if he live in the tryumphe of my slander, what cause have I
to joy in life, or comfort to expose the best part in me, for the contentement
and pleasure of you, who stays to do me reason to so manifest a wrong.

Here the young earl felt himself double passioned, whether he should
perform thexspectacion of his venomous BASILA, whom he loved without measure,
or abstain from violacion of thinnocent blood of his friend, whom the law of
frendshypp forbad him any way to abuse. Albeit to appease the present rage of
the Countess, he promised an effect of her desyer, with spedye punishment of
him, who is not worthy any way (says he) to serve you but in thought,
feedyng her humor with frank words, dissimulynge notwithstanding that
which he thought on the behalf of the Lord Valpergo, whose honesty he knew
to be without malice, and that his discrecion and wisdom, would not suffer him
to stir up any synister, report without great occasion on her part, besides,
he considered that the justice of the quarrel rested in him, for that he had
taken the pray (as yt were out of his mouth, albeit by her procurement, and
that after the other had discontinued his hawnte and course of repair thither,
where with eraminyng the circunstance at large, he found the cause far
insufficient to move any breach of frendshipp between them, but determinynge
to continue the league, he contented her with a dissembled promise, and
restored in the mean time the exercise of their former pleasure, wherein he
passed certain months without the tender of any quarrel to the Lord
Valpergo, who returned (by this time) to Pauya, enjoyed a mutual conversation
with therle Sanseuerino, with such indifferent familiarity, that for the
most part they used but one bed, and one board, with one purse common
between them both, which was not unmarked of the malicious Blanch Maria, who
saying so many fyt occasions, with the offer of convenient time and place,
assistinge therecution of her execrable devise, with provocation to therle to
perform his promise, gave judgment of the case as it was, that her wickedness
was not hable to force an ennymitye between the ij. Lords, and that therle
Gaiazo did but keep her in breath with fair words, only to continue the
glott of his pleasure which he took of her, wherefore disdaynynge so great
an abuse in him, whom (above all men) she reserved as the chief pillar of her
trust, she determined to make a second experience of the same mean, which
served her torn in the dispatche of her first friend, wherein she omitted
neither occasion nor expedicion, for as often as he came to her house, she was
either sick, or troubled with other bulynes that she could not keep him
company, not lettynge sometime to shoott her gates against She discontinueth
her friendship with the Lord Gaiazo.
him, all which because she saw, lacked force to make him refrain, she
retired to thassistance of pollecie, desyeryng him with simple and cold
terms, to do her so much honor, as to forbear from hensfurth all access to
her house, for that she was in mind to return to her husband, with whom,
theffect of atonement was alredye wroughte by certain her friends, who
(being upon the way to fetch her hoame) she would not by any means should
find her in the attire of a Cortisan, or woman making love. Besides (sir)
says she, not without some dissembled tears, I feel a remorce of conscience
on the behalf of the long abuse I have used toward him, and that, albeit my
offense Some faults may be excused that can not be pardoned.
procedynge of follye, seames not altogether worthy of free pardon, yet it
may appear in some sort excusable, so he that confesses his fault, gives
great argument of amendment, and restores the trespass to sufficient
recompense, desyerynge you for end, to have no less consideracion of my
present case, then heretofore you have found no want of good will in me to
satisfye the respect of your pleasure at all times, where with (to prefer a
more credit to her suborned discourse) she promised him a contynuacion of
favor, with assurance of unfeigned good will, so long as nature was content to
lend her the use of life. The earl whether he gave faith to her feigned
words, or dissembled a credytt for the nonst, yet he seamed to persuade a
trothe in the matter, for that, from the hour of such conference, he checked
the humor of his accustomed desyer, using exquisitt medecines to mortifye
that blind affection, which so long had kept him in captiuitye in the
bottomless goolphe of his Pyemount, And be cause he would as well remove the
cause as take away the disease, ferynge least either the view of her
presence, or some force of new charm, might eftesones enchaunte him, and
set abroche the humor of former desyers, he retired immediatlye to MYLLAN: He
feared also the fall of some soddaine mischief, chieflye for that he had
sufficient experience of the cursed disposicion of this Viper, whose heart was
so infected with the poisoned air of every syn, that being wearye of the
exercise of whordome, she would make no conscience to furnishe the stage with
unnatural morders: For what exspectation, of other fruit is in them, whose
minds are clean dispoiled of virtue, if not such as are allowed by the guide
and wicked spirit that governs their diabolical disposition, or who is
ignorant of the tyranny of a woman, converted whollye into the appetit of
rage and revenge, neither is her crueltye any thing inferior to the devouring
monster, The barbarians more curious, the^ we, in obseruinge their laws.
and excedes every way, the brutishe inclination of the barbarous sort of
creatures, whose rage albeit now and then procures them to use force against
the natural procreacio^ and fruits of their own wombes, yet do they stay to
committ any kind of cruelty to such as have traffiqned with them in the
trade of licencious lust, accomptinge no greater sacrilege or profanacion of
the law and ceremonies due to their gods, then to pollute their hands with
the blodde of such as erst have supplied the lust of their sensual pleasure,
wherein if they, which had no kuowledge of god, nor feared the devil, and void
altogether of discipline and experience in humanity, reserved a certain honor
and respect to nature, why should there be either free dispense or tolleracion
of punishment to the wretches of our age, who notwythstandynge the daily use of
the law, written by the very finger of god, and reueiled unto us byhys
prophets and Apostles, with diverse threateninge inhibicions noted in
thinfallible book, do not fear to offend the majesty of the high este, not
only in stayninge their sowles with the spot of adultery, but also in dyenge
the earth with the blodd of their brethren and fellows in Christ, wherein
this history shall present you with a sufficient proof for this time.

The Lord GAIAZO had no sooner left PAVYA, then this infernal goddess began
to attempt the recovery of her first lover VALPERGO wherein notwithstanding
there apeared an equality of doubt and difficulty, chiefly, for that she
feared, that he that last left her, had diciphered her intent, with reuelacion
of the mean she had devised to procure his death: But what enterprise is it,
that he dare not attempt, whose mind is the bondeman and slave of syn, wherein
albeit the beginning seame to ymport a certain difficulty, for that the
soul prefers a resistance, and the conscience waueringe, is moved to a
remorse and remembrance of repentance, yet when a man is alreadis become old in
syn, and the heart enuyroned with the branches of iniquity, the wicked man
has a more facility in thexecution of mischief, then he that is good, hable
to keep the renown of virtue, euenso when youth is norished in ympudencie, and
Shame as necessary for age as awe for young me^.
age deuested of honest shame, there is no peril can make the one affraied,
nor ymputacion of reproach give cause to the other to blushe, like as this
ympudent Pyemount^^se, renewinge the traffic of her aunciente wickedness,
practiced so far with the familiars and friends of him, whose death (as you
hard) she earste conspired by malice, excusinge herself so amply by
embassages and letters of vehement perswacion, that he was content to hear in
what sort she was hable to purge her self, wherein her iustificacion was the
sooner admitted, for that the judge was not only pertiall on her behalf, but
rather enclyned to foolish pytie, then disposed to enjoin just penance:
she promised by protestacion of faith and religious oath, not only to become
his subject and slave, so long as her soul was carried about upon the
mortal chariot of her body, but also gave him at thinstant, a pawn of her
life with all that she had, for the performance of her last promise: Here was
the peace eftsoon concluded between the wicked countess and unhappy earl,
whose articles were registered, and seals put to the night folowinge, when the
Lord VALPERGO was restored to the possession of the fortress which earste
was revolted, and lived long dnder the awe of an other prince, wherein as they
thus renewed the round of their amarous dance, the one fynding a more skoape
of liberty under her recovered lover, then before, the other resolved wholly
to observe thappetite of his Lady, behold a second desyer of blodd, and
suggestion of morder appearing eftsoon in the face of this MEGERA, who
croppinge altogether the herb of revenge, longed now for the destruction of
him, who (as you hard) promised to do sacrafice on the body which presently
she embrased and held in most estimacion, whereof, if she had been demanded
the cause, I think she could have given no other reason of her malice, then,
that deliting in bloddie enterprises, she accounted it a pryncipall virtue, to
commit mischieues of greateste detestacion, for the which notwythstandynge the
reward of mordore was thondered upon her Death the due revv^^de of morder.
at last, with a shameful and miserable end to her self, and vntymelye
death of him, who as the first companion, and next neighbor to her folly,
with equal perticipacion of filthy pleasure, reapposed to much trust in the
villenie of her, who, preferred vice before virtue, and took pleasure in the
devise of bloddie affairs, whereof you shall have the discourse at large in
the last act of this history

BLANCH, Marya, saying her so rempierd in the heart of Valpergo, that her only
word was current to command him, determined to prefer him to thoffice of a
morderer upon the person of him, who erst refuced the charge, wherein addinge
an expedicion to her devise, one night being in bed together, after she had
embrased and feasted him frankly with the filthy follies in love, wherein she
had more then sufficient experience, she discontynued her kisses with a
soddaine scilence, and drawinge her traison a far of, told him, that it is
long since she had to present him with one request of special favor, wherein
because she doubted, either to move his displeasure, or receive a repulse, she
has not only defferred to be ymportunate, but stayed to declare the cause,
which (says she) although it touch you no less then the sauegarde of your
life, and unworthy infamye to your dear Blanch Marya yet is the respect of
your favor of such authority with me, that I had rather use scilence with your
frendshipp and contentment, then be thawthor of the thing that should incense
you to anger. He gave her not only liberty to make her demand, but assurance
(for his part) to perform the effect, at what price so ever it were, for
(says he) if the matter ymport any peril to me, it behooves me to use care of
my life, but if the honor of you be abused, or your self destressed, you can
not ymagyne the diligence, I will put to the revenge of your wrong, and
undertake all your quarelles, wherefore doubt not (good Lady to ymploye him,
who lyuethe but to serve you, and is ready to dye to do you pleasure, Here
she asked him of the frendeshyype between therle GAIAZO and him, and what
assurance he had of his loyalty: such experiences (says he) as
nothing is hable to dissolve our amytie, for I would not stand to be
entreated to offer my body to present danger, to remove his peril, nor he
(I am sewer) would make any conscience to redeem my extremetie with the
hazard of his own life, neither do we use other, then a common
conversation of all things between us, but now to the cause of your
question, wherewyth the traitresse, seeing sufficient words passed in
circumstance, thought e now time to broach a vente for her poison, wherefore
kissynge him in more amarous sort then ever he felt him self embrased
before, told him the poynies wherein he was deceived, touching the trust he
seamed to reappose in his friend, for (says she) you are not so constante
and assured on his behalf, as he full of villanyein dyssemblynge thee malice
which he has of long, hatched under the winge of his deceytful heart, And
to use a simple playnes in so sewer a case, you have cause to give uone other
judgment of him, then as your most cruel and capital enemy in all the
world, wherein because I will not press you to be credulous of a dream, nor
move you to believe any thing, whose Author is not of sufficient authority,
yon shall understand, that he aduowched no less then I have reapported by
the breathe of his own mouth, at such time as he practysed with me in
your late absence, with this addycion, that he should never enjoy a
perfectte quiett of mind, nor taste of the benefit of assured rest or
reappose, til his hands had made morsells of your body and divided al your
parts into small pieces, confirmynge at the same instaunte his bloddye
resolucion by oath of the honor and life of a gentlemanne, that within the
compass of no long time, he would bydde you too such a banquette, that
you should not need any longer, to be careful of the world, nor myndefull
to make love to ladies, wherein he seamed so resolute and grounded in his
malice that (notwithstanding all the persuacions I cold prefer) I cold never
wrest from him the original or cause of this mortal grudge, and albeit at
that time, I was entered into terms of color against you, with more justice
to further his spite, then reason to prevent your peril, or show favor in the
saving of your life, yet the remembrance of our ancient love, (as a virtue
but half mortefied or dead in me) moved me to such a remorse on your behalf,
that I did not only thuttermost of my endeavor to remove the veil of his
intent, but also desyered him with tears, to desyste from such enterprise,
whilst I was in place where you abode, for that I cold not endure the view of
your injury, and much less see you distressed to death, with out the spedie
sacrafyce of mine own life, whereunto he gave not only a deaff ear, but
bound him eftesones to his former protestacion by a second oath, that either
his dead carcass in the place, should witness his good will, or else he would
deliver the world of the Lord Valpergo, all which I had no mean (as the^) to
imparte unto you, by reason of your absence and small access you had hither,
wherein (sir) seeing since the^, your felicity has defended you from danger
and consomacion of his intent, so now I beseech you not only to stand upon
your guard in defending his malice, but also to prevent his pernicius
resolucion, with an act of equal curtesye, for yt is more wisdom to take
away the life of your enemy, then in giuinge place to his malice, to commit
your body to the mercy of his morderinge hand, besides yt is no breach of
virtue, to requite the intent of injury, with an effect of equal revenge, and
your wisdom should be of greater estimacion, and his traison more heinous (for
that he has first abused and broken the law of frendshyp, in dressinge such
mortal ambushes, against so dear a friend, wherein for my part, as I have
discovered the whole conspiracy, under a frank reapport of an unfeigned
truth, so being no less careful of your sauetie, then curious of mine own
life, waghinge them both in the balance of indifferent zeal, I wish you to
follow my advise in preuentyng so ymmynent a danger, and for a more assurance
of your sauetie, to offer thassalte to him, that has already sworn your
destruction, wherein also you shall perform the virtue of a valyant knight,
with full satisfaction of the desyer of her, whom you can not so amply
gratefye, if you presented her with the fre gift of the best Dukedom in
Italye, and now shall I see an effect of the love you bear me, who eftesones
desiereth you not to suffer him to live any longer, that triumphs without
measure, in the unworthy slander of your most affectionate Blanch maria.

If the last words of this folishe Lady had not brought her whole request
in suspicion, her importunities peradventure had procured a consent in therle,
who conferring the points of her discourse, with her vehemency in
persuading, found in deed, that her chiefest meaning tended to the defense of
her own quarrel, whereupon he entered into a pawse, measuring in the secret of
his mind, the terms of her present malice, with thexperience and diverse
proffes of the fydelitie of his friend, whom he knew to be more assured in
virtue, the^ to ymagyn so great a villainy against him, and albeit he knew yt
was but a fetch of his Lady, to sow ye seeds of quarrel between therle
GAIAZO and him, yet to flatter her fond humor for ye time, he promissed to
become the mynister of her cursed will, for a more show and expedicion
whereof, he took his leave, and repaired ymediatlye to Myllan, where he
ymparted to the Lord Gaiazo every point and Article of the venomous discourse
of the Countess, her conclucion and burning desyer of his absolute
destruction, with special suit, that only his hands might be the shameful
execucioners of her execrable devise, wherewith therle Gaiazo was no less
astonished then he had cause, for conferring the terms of his present reaport,
with a fresh remembrance of a former conspiracy (by his hands) touching the
death of him, whom she had now suborned to procure the destruction of himself,
cried out of thyniquitie of the gods in sufferynge the earth to be infected
with the breathe of so wicked a woman, and exclaymed against nature, in that
she did not abridge the course of life in so horrible a monster, whose
pestilent air (says he) if God defend not his people, is hable to corrupt a
whole countreye, oh how iustelye has God visited the sins of her father,
for The sin of the father punished upon the children.
his cursed vsuries, upon his wretched daughter, and rightly punished ye
villenies of her predecessors, in an ymp spro^g of so vile a stock: how is yt
possible to make a froward kite, a forward hawke to the river, or the boochers
curr to draw a true sent to the hurt dear? likewise this pattorne of
corruption, being the daughter of a villain, who was borne to no more
portion, then vij. foot of inheritance in the church yard, and her mother more
fair then chaste, and less virtuous then honest, has not only abandoned
her country and husband for the glott of her insatiable lust, aunsweringe all
comers without excepcion, in the singler combat of her beastly desyer, but also
is come to keep an open boocherie or slaughter house to execute the nobility
of Italy, But for my part, if yt were not for ye dishonor that would attend
me, in defyling my hands with the blood of such a filth, I assure you I would
draw her by the hair to the public theatrie or place of execucion in Myllan,
where after she had confessed, how often and in what sort, she has desiered
me, with her hands cloased, and eyes full of dyssemblyng tears, regardyng the
majesty of the heavens, to comitt morder upon my dear VALPERGO, thies hands
should divide her villainous carcass into more pieces then there be days in
the year. And besides, I was never of so vile or base condition, but that I
durst discover and aduonche what grudge so ever I had conceived against any
man, neither do I think that you have other opynion of me, then to be one of
your most loyal and assured friends, whereunto the other replied that thonlie
respect of the fidelity he reapposed in him, keepte him from performynge her
pernicius and bloddie sommonce, and that he had not only disclaymed her
acquaintance and company also, but abandoned the place of her being, for
fear of further enchauntement and seeing (says he) that God has holden his
holy haunde over us, and our fortune hetherunto defended us from danger, let
the view of our peril passed, withstand the offer of future mischief, and
in eschewyng the air of such infection, let us also from hensfurthe dysmisse
our devotion to that ympp and image of SATAN: had yt not been a great
comendacion to us, to have entered into quarrel, and committed mutual
slaughter, one of an other, for the recreacion and pleasure of such a minion,
whose simple remembrance I assure you is so hateful unto me at this present,
that I find a falte in my self, that in bidding her farewell, I gave her not
an hundredth estockadoes through the body, to the end the example and due hyer
of her badd life, might procure a terror to others, that thirst after the
blood of such unnatural morders: Albeyt as the course of her wretched life
argues an unhappy end, so I dowte not but her miserable death will take
suffycient revenge of the wrong she has offered to us both, In the mean
time I wish in us both an utter forgetfulness of her and her follies, And
feynge the gain she has got by us, may be cowched in the least corner
of her coffers, we have small cause to grieve in any loss, saving in the
ympairiuge of our reputation, for yeldynge honor to one so far unworthy of
our company, wherewyth ended the discourse between the ij. young Lords, who
(ever after) forgatte not to continue the remembrance of their venomous
BASILIKE with words of oppen infamye in what company so ever they were,
both, what intisynge means she had to train men too her lure, and with
what subteltyes she dismyssed theyme, being wearye of their company, or when
she saw an offer of fresh supplye, the brute whereof, Albeyt gave her certain
frettynge alarams at the stomach, yet nature had lent her such a grace,
that she neither blushed at the same, nor was moved to remorse with the view
of her evil, But disgested both the one and the other with an ordynarie face
of shameless complexion, wherein notwithstanding she was neither so precise nor
constant, but the inward grypes she felt, had almost forced a depryuacion of
liberty and senses, the rather with the view of an Italyan Epigram,
inueighinge bitterly against her disordered life, composed as they said by
therle VALPERGO, which because I never saw, nor have means to recover a true
copy, I leave without judgment or reapport, But thusmuche I dare aduowche of
her collerike passion, procedinge chieflye by that inuectiue, that if she had
had either captain or soldiers at her commandment, she had made ij fair
Anotomyes of both their bodies, whereof notwythstandynge Signeur Valpergo
escaped not without sharpp penance, as one upon whom she founded her greatest
grudge, for that as he was the first that skirmished with her, hand to hand
in her cloase chamber, so he was the last that brake his faith, and dissembled
theffect of his promise: By this time every post and posterne in PAVYA was
painted with pamphelettes, written in proase and verse of the bowntefull life
of the countess, every comedy and stage play babled of her vicious trade,
the bells rong of her inordinat lust, and the birds in the Air cried out
against her, in such sort, that she did not only refrain to come abroad, and
show her self either in street or window, but ymagyninge that the change of
air and place would take away the blaspheymous noise of the brute, trussed up
her baggage, and departed by moon light without sound of trompett from PAVIA
to MYLLAN, where, as she was first invested with robes of honor by marriage with
the Viscont Hermes, so her destynies seamed to reserve that place as a witness
and theatry of her degradacion, not only of honor, but also of life, for she
had not long so iornied at MILLAN, but there arrived a captain with a charge
of certain trowpes of horsemen called Don Pierro de Cardonne a Scycylyan borne,
and bastard brother to therle of Colysan, whose father dyinge at the battle
faught at Bycoque, left him no other portion nor revenue, but such as he gatt
by the enterteinement of the wars: his age exceded not xx. or xxj. years,
somewhat swarffye of complexion, and mallencollike in the regard of his
countenance, with a skar or hurt in the face, lent him by chance in a fraye,
but for the rest, sufficiently furnished with good proporcion, who made his
chief exercise to pass up and down the streets, where glauncinge now and
then upon this alluring image of Venus, took no time to debate the matter at
large, but upon the sudden became extremely in love with her, in such
sort, as he entered into devise, to have familiar conference, and make an offer
of his service unto her, who better experienced in the trade of love then he,
albeit she saw him young and hable enoughe to answer the combatt of her
lust, yet to stir up a more vehemency of love, and give her self a
greater incorporacion in his heart, she lewred him by peecemeale, till she had
sufficientlye manned him, and framed him by the measure of her own will: for
if this young pigeon of the first plume chanced to epsy her out of the
window: yeldynge her reverence with a sighe according to the vain Spanyarde,
she would not stick to requite him with a countenance of semblable courtesy,
and soddainelye shot the casement, and withdraw her self from his sight,
leaving the sellye Captain, tyeringe upon a taste of pleasure enterlarded
also with a desperate hope never to enjoy her otherwise then in secrett and
uncertain wishes. And albeit he was of sufficient experience to train and
lead his men, with courage enough in the feeld, yet seamed he no less void of
skill then far from audacitie, and so ignorant in the pursuit of this
queste, as if he had never made court to any Lady of reputacion or honor,
which forced the rather a vehemency of his torment on the behalf of his new
mystres, whose majesty and coye estat, keeping always within her pallays, as
yt argued a certain degree of honor, so the same gave also a greater increase
to his passion with intent to do her al honor he cold, for besides, that he
passed by her gate every day in great bravery of change of horse and
apparel, with his men moosteryng about him, and other pomppe of a captain,
making his horse make good the Toto Pomado with other lofty tornes above
ground, when he came against the window that yielded the first view and
prospect of her beauty, yet for a further declaracio^ of his affectioned
service, he walked one evening a long the pallaice of his lady with a noise of
soft music, to procure her to come to the window, when himself took a
treble lute, and gave her a good night, in a song, no less doleful in note
and tune, then of desperate substance, with such stoare of sighs and regards of
pity in his face, that who had seen his ghastelie countenance at that time,
would have judged him to be served with the last process and sentence
diffynitiue of his life, or that he had made love to one of the blood royal in
spain, in the end of which moarning music, Dom Pierro, as one out of hope to
recover any one ^ote of favor of his mistrys, being upon his departure and
retire to his lodging, was requested, to come in by one of her women, who
opening the gate, conueighed him alone through a fair gardeine into a large
gallerie, honge on either side, with sondrie sorts of pictures and tables of
love and folly, where the countess did not only give him great thanks for
the honor he did her with his solemn musycke, but also yielded him such other
choice of familiar curtesye, that he seamed rather astonished with the presence
of the place he so much desired, then hable to bestow any thanks, or other
simple show of duty upon his new gooddesse, who seeing his symplicitie,
thought yt was now time to stop the lewer upon him, and give him some
assurance by words and effect, as well as she had trained him so far by
arguments of outeward glee, wherefore taking him by the hand, she led him to a
low bed furnished with green satin, where (being set together) she used
this short order of collacion unto him.

Albeit (sir) ye show of my present curtesy may stur up in you The countess to
her last lover.
some cause of synister suspicio^, the rather, for that, having no other
knowledge, nor assurance of your honest behauior, then a simple reaport of your
name and nobilitye, I have given you credit to enter my house, at so indece^t
an hour, yet being in some part excused by the liberty of our country, which
excedes the strait inhibition of the Ladies in Spain and Scycylya, I am also
to defeat all sorts of imputation that way, by the special regard of
honor, I have always used on the behalf of strangers, toward whom, as I was
never a nigarde of my liberalitye, specially, when they do me that honor to
visitte my house, So for your part, for that I find no cause asyet either to
disclaim or discontinue my accustomed bountye from you, I am content to assure
you no less welcome, then any man that ever had access hither, with
commission, that the doare, being ready to be opened at what hour so ever
you knock, you may be bold to dispose of me and mine no less franklye,
then if the propertye of all that I have rested in your self: which
enterteinement, as it was unlooked for of Seigneur Pierro, So the liberal offer
of his mistres took away the passion of his domme trance, and not only
restored him again to the liberty of his speech, but also renforced him with
a new courage to put his request upon terms, and make a tender of his service,
with protestation, that if she would pass a grant of her good will, and
admit him for her secret servant and friend, he would use such endeavor to make
declaration of the dutiful zeal he bare her, that she should find him
nothing inferior to any gentilman that ever made profession of love or other
service to his Lady, nor have cause any way to mislike her choice, for yt he
would never be so rash in promise, as ready to expose an effect, nor she so
willing to require, as he twyse diligent to parforme thuttermost of her
commandments, she felyng her self clawed in yt place that ytched most,
replied with a smyling countenance, that there perience of the often breach of
promise in such as use to court us simple Ladies with the merchandise of
love, does argue so much thinco^stancye of men, (says she) that for my part,
if I saw a present effect of true loyaltye before mine eyes, yet could I
hardlye he brought to repose either credit or assurance in any promise, seeing
men them selves now a days are infected with the air of such fragility, that
they neither respect the honestye of their word, nor the virtue in parformyng
the least effect of a thousand liberal offers they make at unawares. Albeit as
he yt charge the guyltles with the offense of the murderer, does wrong to his
innocencye, so I have learned that it is a special virtue to be persiall in
opinion toward strangers, and judge the best of every man. wherefore for your
part (sir) if you will enlarge the offer of your first faith with this
addicion, that I may be bold to imploye you in one spectall affair of mine at
such time as I shall sommon you thereunto, I am content not only to put you in
possession of your request, But also to bynd my self to no less loyaltye on
your behalf, then ever appeared in any Lady to wards her faithful servant.
The captain that would willyngly have sacrifised him self for the ransom of
her favor, stood not to examine what charge she would enjoin him unto, but
confirmed an assurance with sundry sorts of oaths, being no less rash in ye
promise of euel, the^ hasty to perform thexecutio^, as herafter you shall
hear. Here was brewed the broth or preparatyue of the fatal obsequies of her
former love, and the earnest penny given of the blodie bargayn and death of
Seigneur Valpergo, for she, by the too liberal and unhonest vent of her
honor, made him the Borreau and unnatural executioner of noble blod, defacinge
by ye same means the gentry of his house, which he ought to have preserved
til the last drop of blood in his body. And remaining there all that night, she
made him so pleasant a ba^quet of delicat kysses and other exercises of ye bed,
that the more he tasted of ye pleasure, the more he thrusted with desire to
continue ye sport, and ye subtle Cirses for her part, seemed so vehement in
love, with dissimuled arguments of unfeigned affection that in persuading
himself of the victory of her good will, he thought he had made a conquest of
the whole east part of the world, seming so drowned in the devotion of his
new Saint, and charmed with the enchauntmentes of her art, which (peradventure
lent her some power or assistance of legierdemain) to force his humor of
earnest zeal, that if she had said the word, he had made no conscience to
have committed the whole City of Myllan to the mercy of fire and gunpowder,
like as Blouse de Cume, was redye to put fire into all parts of the city of
Rome, if the Sedicius Tyberyus Gracchus had given it him in charge: such is
the rage and frantyke folly of youth, when they suffer their amarous transport
to excede the caryr of reason or discression, and from this fountayn have
distilled heretofore many destructions of Realms with subuercio^s and
alteracions of monarchies, wherein also may be noted a marvelous corrupt and
vain disposicion in such as will rather affect and haunte the company of a
public curtysan, then honor the virtue of a chaste lady, although she were his
lawful wife and companion of bed, and yet those gallandes will not stick to
Ieste and point at the married man, governed sometime by the sage advice of his
lawful wife, where they seem ready at the commandment of a strompet or
arrand whoare, not only to hazard the price of their honor, but also (in
favoring thinstygacio^ of her wickedness) to make their testament upon a
skafolde layinge their heads under the edge of the sword of Justice, wherein I
need not torn over many books for copy of examples, seeing you may be
sufficiently satisfied with ye view of the folly of this bastard of Cardonne
in performinge the suggestion and malice of this mordering corntesse, who
saying her captain sufficientlye framed to the postey of her will, thought it
was now time to put him in remembrance of his promise, and somon him to the
revenge of them that thought no more of her co^spiracyes nor traynes of
treason, wherein as the hour approached that her Lascivious trade of life
should be enjoined to open penance, and the wrong and violacion of faith to
her husband, with her pernicious intentes and effects of murders, receive
their due hyre and punishment, and that the rage of destenie would not be
appeased till some man wear committed to execution, so for a more expedicion of
the fatal end of her miserable life, she entised her bastard lover into a
close arbor in the gardin where only ye birds wear witness of their discourse,
and brake with him in this sort. If nature (Sir has given to every one a
special care to hold the use of life most dear with a peculyar desyer to
favor the course of our days with so long a term as we can, how much more are
we bound to embrace and be careful of that which causes us to live with a
singular renome from amongst the rest of the baser sort of people, who lyenge
always in watch to mark our order of living, are no less glad to have an
occasion of slander, then redye to impart it to all the world, with such
percialitye of unworthy bruit, yt the greater we seame in degree, the more
heinous they make our offense, and mortal fautes not only scarce noted, but
also tolerable in meaner personages, wherein as we women are most incident to
the awe of that malicious clymat of people, both for that they Sift us and our
doings more narrolye the^ the rest, and because we being the weaker company,
are not armed with sufficient force to resist their rage, so the indifferent
sort ought not to be rash in judgment on their sides, nor give sentence of
discredit or dishonesty against us, the rather by a sinister suggestion of
such a vulgar and barbarous crewe, neither ought we to spare or fear any
sort of revenge, which may advance the recouerye of that whereof we are
wrongfully deuested.

Thus much I have inferred (sir as a preamble to the request I mean to make,
which I take god to witness procedes not to much of desyer to pursue the
revenge of wrong I have alredie received, as to make known to all the world,
with what integritye I go about to preserve the renome of my former reputacion,
knowinge right well that the earth bears nothing so precious or of so great
value, that is hable to restore or make good the forfeiture of the honor of a
la dye of equal Calibre and calling to me, And because I will not keep you in
long suspense, nor with tedyous circum stance move any myslike to him that
has offered to Justify my cause against them, whose wickedness have procured
these terms of just complaynte, it may like you to understand, this, as not
long sins I remained at PAVIA with a train convenient for my degree, may
ntaynynge court and hospitality in such sort, that the greateste estate
seamed content with myneordynar ie, so amongst the rest of the repair and
access to my house, I was vysited with an often hawnt of two earls of equal
nobylytie and semblable descent of honor, to whom albeit I used an indifferente
countenance, exposing no great argument of famylyaritie on their behalfes,
then (as you se) I show to every gentleman, yet forgetting thestymacion of
their own race, and rank which I hold, they have seemed of late so
unthankful, to the honor I used toward them, that I find a return of the
meryt of my curtesye with a general brute of open slander, begone and continued
by them, who also cease not as yet to endeavor to make my name no less
notoryous of Infamye, then if I wear the most common curtisan in Rome or
Venyce wherein as the virtue of my Innocencye is hable to satisfye thopynions of
such as know me, for that thintegretie of my life hethervnto parswades them,
that I am both belyed by malice, and slaundred without cause, so al
strangers, and specyallye the vulgar sort, conferringe my delycate and brave
order of lyuinge, with the parnicious rumor of these gallandes, doughts not to
confirm their vylaynes with an absolute Judgment, that I am no less
dishonest in deed, then their brute has published in every corner and cuntrye
of I talye, whereof besides yt mine own conscience does absolve me, yet dare I
plead and appeal to the testymony of your self to depose the contrary,
protestynge unto you by the heyght of the highest throne in heaven, that only
you have vanquyshed the chastyty of Blanch Marye, who if she should any way
lose your presence, could not enjoy the air of MYLAN four and twentye hours,
for that, those roysters and slaunderus earls have brought me in so bad a taste
amongst all honest company, and yet would I not depart without a revenge of
the wrong they have done me, wherein if I cannot be assisted with the help of
any man, I assure you this carcass shall either be found dead in
thenterprise, or these hands shall comitt the fatal execution of these
corrupt wreches, whose malice have set abroche the vessel of unworthy
slander to mine honor and estymacion, wherwyth she forsed a sodayn complexion
of dolor in her face, in such sort, that the tears which distilled from her
eyes dropped all a longest her chekes and breasts of the coollour of thazured
alablaster, and watered the whole bosom and body of the Scycilyan, who having
no other god but the countess, and seeing thympetuositie of her distres,
enquired of her in a marvelous rage, what he was that durst abuse her, who had
at commandment a captain with his whole enseigne of men at arms and
soldiers, ready to march at the sound of her drom, to defend her quarrel,
and take vengance of such as oppress her, swearyng at thinstante by the faith
and honor of a soldior, that if he knew the names of thies ympude^t wretches,
al ye world should procure no dispense of their death, and he only would cut
them in as many pieces, as there be members of their wicked bodies, wherefore
(says he) (ymbrasing his infernal goddess) give me only a note of their
names, and you shall see what difference I use between doing and saying,
simple words and deeds of effect, and do away thies tears without further
remembrance, or care to revenge your enemies, for you shall see, that I will
tonse them so conyngly, that herafter they shall need no barber to rownde
their hair.

This frank promise with the liklyhode of spedye effect, breathed such a
fresh air of consolacion into the mordering countess, that after she had
coolled and embrased him in a thousand sorts, with an offer and liberal
dedication of her life, with all that she had, even until the last and
extreme dropp of her blodde, told him the names of her enemies, who says
she, are not hable to make good any way, the forfeiture of mine honor but by
their death and perentorie destruction, wherewith he willed her eftsoon to
dismiss all care, and reapose herself upon him, for says he, before
thexpiracio^ of many days, you shall hear such news as you long for, wherein
he failed neither of the time nor effect of his promise, for that the next
night he was advertised by certain espialls, which he had set for the
purpose, that therle Valpergo, supped in the town, wherefore he armed him self
with twenty men at arms of his soldiers, and lay in ambushe of either
side the street, where therle should pass in his return to his lodging, who
with his brother arm in arm, with some five or six of their pages and
servants, between ten and eleven of the clock in the evening, came deuisynge
merely together till they were at the Iaumbe or torn of a street that
stretches to saint Iacques, where soddainly they saw them selves assailed
and set upon on all sides with men in armor, and finding their force far to
weak to maintain skirmish with so great a trowpe armed at all points up to
the throat, and they only, the simple assistance of the rapior and cloak,
began to flee, but they found astopp of passage in every place, in such
sort, as therle and his brother, with the rest of their small crewe, were cut
in pieces in one instante, albeit as morder is the sin most detestable affore
God, so we see few or none escape unpunished, nor any done in such secret but
the majesty of the higheste, reserues a No morder escapes unpunished
mean to discover it, for in the heat of this sharp medley, therle ARDIZZYNO
espied the basterde PIERRO, whom he named and called upon many times, but
all in vain, which being hard and aduouched by one of the townsmen,
standing rather in his window to cry aim, then helping any way to part the
fraye, was the cause that he was taken the same night, and committed to
prison, by thautoritie of the duke of BVRBON lieutenante and chyefe governor
within MILLAN for the emperor Charles the fyfte, and the next day fearing the
offer of the rack or other torments, he confessed the fact, with the cause
to proceed of the sinister subornation of the Countess Blanch Marie, whose
life and trade, according to the discourse you have already hard, he ymparted
at large, to the DVKE and rest of the council, she being advertised of the
whole, had time and liberty to flee, but god which is just, would not that
her wickedness should be assisted with any longer date, seeing that if she
had lived, her malice, would also have raged upon therle GAIAZO, who by good
chance was at that time out of the town.

The next day she was sent into an other prison in the town, to avoid
conference between Dom Pierro and her, whereof there was more cause of fear
then needed, for that upon the first examination, she confessed the whole
conspiracy, trusting belyke, in, I can not tell how many her thousand
crowns, where with she hoped to corrupt the governor or such as bare
authority under him, wherein her exspectation, was no less frustrate, then her
destinies seamed weary to favor her with longer life, for the offer of her
crowns was hateful to the vpryghte ministers of instice, and other means of
medyacion had no place in the senate, for that she was judged to be taken
out of prison, the second day after the morder, and loase her head in the
place of public execution, in the mean while, the capteines of the army,
purchassed the life of the bastard of CARDONO, and sent him with diverse
letters of comendacion to the emperor, who for the respect of his experience
and practis in war, advanced him to a charge conueniente for his skill.

And albeit the last arreste and sentence diffinitiue of the miserable
countess, was communicated unto her, to the end she might put her self in
readiness to pass the dreadful journey of death, yet seamynge to repose much
for her self in the assistance of her coffers, she neither dismayed at the
news, nor disposed her self any way toward God, until the sergeantes
criminal, taking her out of her dongeon in the castle, led her to the fatal
theatrie in the market place where was erected a fair skaffolde, to play the
last act of her tragedye upon, there ye wretched Lady entered into open
confession of her faltes and former life in the hearing of the multitude,
desiring God upon her knees with great effusion of tears, not to deal with
her according to her deserts, but that she might enjoy the benefytt of his
mercy, and that he would not argue against her, for if he judged her
according to her iniquities, she was not hable to abide it, and so desyering
the people to prefer their prayers on her behalf, for her better assistance of
ye spirit of grace in her perilous passage which she had to parforme, she
renounsed nature by the deadly blow of the sword of execution which took away
the head from the parnicious body of her, who in her life never found any
wickedness which she did not only ymbrace, but excede with ymitation, and
increase with further vylanye, nor was acquaynted with any virtue, which she
did not abuse, or convert into an agrauacion of sin: a goodlye example suer,
for the youth in our time, seeing that the greatest part launsynge
indifferentlye into the gulphe of all abhominacion, are governed only by the
transport of their vain and foolysh conceits, without having respect to the
sundry, mischefes and impositions of shame which fail not to attend the end of
such exercises, for if the Lord of Cardonne hadd not been rescowed by
the assistance of a good fortune, and taken out of the hands of distress by
special aid of the other Captains, it may be easily judged what misery had
thundered upon him by geuinge himself in pray to the flatteringe appetit of a
light and foolish woman, who seamed to yield him more glee or favor, for the
satisfieng of her own lust, and to perform her malicious devise, then for any
respect of loyaltye or true love, Indiferent care of his honor, or honest
regard to her own estimation, and trewlye as his misfortune is great, that
bestows his affection upon a whore, for that he is incident to a thousand
inconveniences: So his folly is no less, that persuades himself to be beloved
of a common doxie, saying their amytie continues no longer then they reap
either pleasure or profit, neither are they so inconstant in love, as void of
measure in Imaginacion of mischiefs, wherein for that our plentiful time yeldes
us choice of examples and sort of familyar experience, I am content to abridge
the Justification at this time, for that to maintain continual argument of
morders or affairs full of peril, is often hurtful to the quiet mind,
desiring sometime a pleasant recreacion from affliction, no less then the pylot
or weary mariner couets a present calm and appeasement of angrye EOLE after
they have been long forwearyed in contending against the malice of their
fortune among the perilous strayghts of thunquiet occean.

And albeit the corruption of our own nature is so great, that we take more
delight to hear a discourse or beadroll of folyes, then in reports enterlarded
with admonicions full of reason and wysedom, yet am I persuaded, that such as
have their minds typped with virtue, cannot be so perua^^, nor void of good
disposition, as the other wretches, whose lives bearing the badge of infamy,
makes them also sequestrated from the rest of the good sort, wherein we ought
to be fullye resolved, that there is no History, (how full of pleasant delight
so ever it appear) which yeldes not with all, wholsomme Instructions to
dyrecte our lives, neyneyther ought we to be soscrupulous or full of curiosity
As either to condemn or mislike the pleasant comodye for that it is not
painted with ye serenety of the Stoickes, seeing the volumes of profaned
records, and scripture it self do note unto us the lives of sundre vicious
parsons, not for that we should enter into terms of grudge against the
reaport of such ancient antiquity, nor dispose our selves to the imitation
of the like vices, but rather in vewynge the strange and grievous punishment
which ordinarily has overwhelmed such sin, to learn and labor to direct
our lives by the contrary of their examples, which is one respect that made
me put my pen in exercise to prefer this history to our vulgar tongue, to
thend also that the frail youth of our country, that follow the damnable path
of iniquity, may see how sewer they are to feel the heavy hand of God, who
blesses the good sort with a plentyfull gift of his grace, and punishes the
wicked with sundry sorts of affliction.

FINIS.
The argument
WE should not need so much thassistance of foreine records, nor report of
aunciente histories exceeding the compase of our age and memory, if we were as
careful to note thaccydentes of our own time, as we seame curious in
admiracion of rare things whose glorious antiquity with parcialitie of fame,
settes a more price of thindeuor of others, the^ their diligence and doings
deserve by justice, like as the greeks and romans painting with an
exquisitedexteritie of ye pen, their policy in war, the valiantnes of their
Captains, their wonderful fortune and good success in all enterprises, with
other discourses of their virtues, do argue them more glorious in their own
acts, then meritorious in dead of true commendacion, for that in arrogatinge
unto themselves the only title and name of all knowledge, they make our time
seem naked of all virtue, sauinge such as is derived from them and ymytacion
of their doings. Albeit we may object with the spartayne against thathenians,
that those lippwise soldiers or scoole orators, had a more facility in
discovering, then facylitie in execucion of noble effects: not for that I mean
to do such wrong to their estimacion, as not to yield to them a title of
singularity in all perfections, yet I may also be bold to prefer the benefit
of our time which participating with their golden age in any respect of honest
gift or quality, is hable to present a furniture of as many examples and
authorities of virtue as we read were found in the politic state of Rome when
Cato, Camilla, or Scipio, governed that proud City, or when on Pericles,
Themistocles or Aristides bare authority in the florishinge Acadimia, of
Athens, for if we go about to discourse of the valyantnes in arms, or stody to
be pryuy to ye sleightes and pollecy in war, we need not thassistance of one
Hannybal, discipline of Marius, pellecy of Pompeius nor courage of Caesar or
Alexander, seeing our fertile Evropa brings forth such store of excellent
captains, that if those great couqwerours and subuertors of whole countries
amongs the Greeks and Romans, were now in the feilde with their invincible
force, they should not find a mettellus orgalozs without arms, nor encounter
a company of effemynate Persyans, or have to do with serfull Italyans but they
should buckle with the valiant cauelery and gendarmy of france, feel the force
of the courageous englishmen, make a proof of the puisance of the mighty
Almaine, and make head against the arms of the lofty Spanyarde, wherein as
the shortness of time denies me to yield to every captein, and soldier his
peculyar commendacion, so my endeavor could not escape without ympu tacion of
superfluity, if I should enterlard my Catalogue of the gracious gifts of our
time, with the due glory of the fathers of justice, devising wonderful
pollicyes and necessary Laws for regard of the public weal in the senate,
wherein our world I think owes nothing to antiquity, neither need I
prefer the singularity and exquisite skill of our payntors or forgers of
curious images, whose art at this day contendes with the aunciente conninge
of Appelles Albeit upon the commendacions of these dexterities in arms, and
arts concerning ye hands, I find attendinge a worthy cause of general
complaynte against the slowthfulnes of our time, geuinge with all the title of
just praise to the diligence of thauncyentes, who preserving the memory of
such as deserved reuowme amo^genst them for any virtue, has left us cause to
blush in our own abuses, and be ashamed of the negligence we use in recording
the rarietyes of our time or perfections of such as are justly meritorious of
praise, and albeit of long time thiniquitie of the bad sort of men, have so
much prevailed over the worthy renown of virtuous women, that they have not
sticked to whet their malicious tongues, with diverse blasphemous reproaches
against such as by misfortune have given some salfe bownd to their honor, yet
ought we not to be vnthanckful to the chastetie and honest conversation of the
rest, who rather then they would depart with the badge of their pudycitie, have
been seen with their bodies full of wounds, and faces died with blood, and
sometime passed the panges of painful death, in resistinge the force and
fleshely vylanye of the wicked corrupters of the virginity, wherein if the
Goekes ^aue given such great comendacion to the fair Hippo, who being made a
pray amongst other spoils of ye country to a barbarous pirott on the sea,
with present danger to depart with the badge of her honor, chused rather to
bury her body, in the belly of some fyshe, and consecrat her integrytie to the
waves, then suffer an insydell pallyard to hurt her soul to the death in
depryuinge her of that, which all the world are not able to restore or make
good: if the Boecyans have not forgot to engraue in pillors of eternetye, the
memory of a Lady in Thebes, who forced to the vyolacion of her body by a
rude soldier often he King of the macedonions dissimuled for the time her
dystres with feigned shows, that she delyted in the pleasure, til, encountringe
at last a convenient occasion, she revenged the wrong done to her honor with
the death of him that had used such force against her, where also, herself
loathing the use of longer years, having already lost the only joy and
felicity in life, gave place to nature, and at thinstanct made a blody
sacryfice of herself by her own hands, And if the Romans have had always in
their mouth the praise of Lucrese whose chastetie they have placed in the
theatrye or circle of Mars, and given her a chief place among the trains of
the chaste Diana, if all these I say have been so thankful to the virtuous
women of their time, that by their diligence the memory of their virtue
remains in record to the posterity of all ages, what worthy cause of
rebuke have we, who living under a better clymat and constellacion, enjoying
more pure laws, and aspiring nerer thymage or semblaunce of dyuynitie, will
not erpose the noble fruits of our time, which yeldes not only example of
sembla ble virtue to thauncientes, but excedes them in contynent lyuinge and
chaste disposicion, whereof we have an example of Yphygenne daughter of ye king
of Ethiopia, who having already vowed her vyrginitie to the spouse of our
souls accepted rather the offer of present death, then to be joined in
Marriage to a wanton young prince (provided for her by her father) with a
number of like authorities which I cold infer to prove the sincerity of
women, who at the beginning, when our religion was first founded did lay the
cornerstone of puretie without having ye knowledge of man: neither is our age
so void of examples of contynency, nor the root of virtue so clean extirped
from amongst us, but we may se at this day sundry pattorns of pudycitye in
the persons of all degres of women, as well noble as of meaner condition,
exceeding the virtue of such as antiquity has in so great veneraion: wherein
for a familiar revenge of our Ladies now a days touching the synyster
ympositions of diverse evil tongues inveighinge against the whole sect, I have
presented hereupo^ the stage this history taken out of Italyon, whose
authority as it is sufficient to answer the combat against the wicked
chalengors of the undefiled honor of the sacred sect femynyne, so the discourse
is able to move compassion to the hearts of men participatiug with nobility,
and set abroach the conduites of tears in the eyes of such Ladies and
gentlewomen, as take more pleasure to preserve in eutyer the Jewel of their
honor, then to open their ears to ye charm of the vain Lover, passioned as
be fayneth, for a bewtye that passes with the morning dew, importinge also
more cause of admiracion, as the person (in whom thaccident is veryfied) is of
simple estate, for that the higher she is in degree, the more care ought she to
have of her honor, exposing arguments and effects of virtue to the meaner sort,
like as the torch or Hemispher starr, gives light to the little candel and
element of less substance: I wish the young ladies and damesells of our
country would painte this table in their hearts, and with the virtue and
ymytacion of her chastity, fortesye them selves against the pepred allurme^ts
of the crafty souler, who makes war against their honor under thensigne of the
blind captein Cupid, and directed by ye guide of folly, and not by example of
her death to force an untimely and unnatural destynie, or end of their days.

IVLYA DROVVNETH her self for that her body was abused by force.
YT need not seem doubtfuli to any at this day, that GaZolo, is percel of the
duke dom of Mantua, planted in a most plesa^t solie right over against the
father of floddes sometime called Iryden and now beringe the name of. PO.
whose sundry brooks, divided into diverse streams and pleasant chanells,
norisheth by their moistures the whole country of Italy, like as also it is of
no less credit, that within our time and memory, there was borne and bred up
in the same town, a maid called Iulya, whom, if fortune had preferred to the
title of a princes or great Lady, whereby her virtues might have bone
brought in reputacion by authority of high estate, like as her godly order and
chaste conversation of life, made her name famous, she might have served (no
doubt) as ye only lantern to give light to al degres of youth in our age: her
father was not made of so mean a molde, for his birthe, as attended upon with
continual poverty, having only for his portion, the assistance and travail
of his hands to sustain himself and famylie, wherein albeit necessity (being
ye most greuouse scourge of man's life) pincheth commonly so extremely, that
she makes us many times forget both honor, honesty, and good order, Ye and
abuse the goodness of our nature, yet shall you find some, so wholly resolved
in virtue, and stand so sewerly upon the guarde of their honest name, That
rather then the hungry rage of poverty, or gnawing worm of necessity have
power to induse them to do ye thing that their honor and honesty cannot
justify, they will not stick to resign the hard and extreme condition of their
state into ye hands of the miserable world by some glorious death, which is the
only and chief repose of mysery, and undoubted consolacio^ of such, as are
always persecuted with ye malice of aduer sitie, whereof you may note a famyliar
proof in the sequel of this Iulya who (notwithstanding the poverty of her
parents) had won by her own industry such a general commendacio^ of good
government and chaste conversation of life, that exceeding therein all the rest
that were but her matches in equality of birthe and calling, she brought also
a decoracion of state and increase of glory to the obscure name and pettegre of
her poor ancestors, neither was she of less fame for the praise of her
beauty and semely shape of body, wherein nature seemed to advance her with such
assistance of her coming, that she appeared amongst the rest of her
companions, as the glorious rose in the fragrant and pleasante morning of may:
she had also such a special gift and order in spekinge, with a stayed
countenance duringe her conference with any, together with a wonderful grace in
giving to every one the due reverence of his calling, that notwythstandyuge
the simplicity of her house, with the small assistance of discrecion, not yet
confirmed with the number of xvi. years, her womanly and wise order, might
serve to instruct some Ladies of high calling, and make blushe a number of
great dames, that account theymselues without comparison in diverse courts
in Italy and else where, Albeit as all these virtues and rare gifts, served
rather to increase her praise and commendacion among the people, then any suer
mean to supplye the poverty of her parents, or releue the hardenes of her
own state, so her father forgate not to imploye her in the trade of honest
toil, and teach her to tread the steps of his travail, sometime framynge
her to the use of the wede hook, to torn up the earth with a spade in the
gardeine, and as occasion served to taste now and then of the husband man's
toil in attendynge the ploughe with other exercises of pain, always
incidente to the poor man, as his only portion to defend him from the
violence of hunger and extreme myserye, which two hard enemies with the severe
diligence of the father, seamed so whollye to pursue this younglinge, that there
was no exercise of profit or honest travail of the hand, wherein she did not
excede or do as well as the best, being withal so wholly resolved to preuente
the malice of fortune, with the sweat of her brows, that she was not seen to
suffer the least moment of time to pass, without the dispatch of some honest
labor, persuading herself, that as ydlenes is ryghtlye termed ye root of sin,
and mother of mischief, and special enemy Ydlenes the mother of mischief.
to seduce and corrupt the chastity of women, so she is chieflye to be
wythstanded with the armor of honest endeavor, being denied to invade the
hearts of such, as keep their bodies accompanied with contynual travail,
neither does that detestable vice expose other fruits, then filthy
ymagynacions and conceytes of mischief according to thauctorytie In doing
nothing men learn to do evil.
of PLATO, who affirms, that in doing nothing, men learn to do evil,
wherein he is iustefied also by diverse textes of the scriptures, willinge us
nor to be idle, least we fall into the danger of the temptor, which Solomon
in like sort does aduowe, saying the devil is always in ambushe to enter in
them, whose hearts he fyndes occupied with vain thoughts and their bodies
absteyning from honest labor, and truly me thinks the true christian, can
not stand too sewerlye upon his guarde in avoydynge the penalcyes of ydlenes,
seeing the terrible threats of the gospel, somonynge us by the very words of
our savior, to render account before the throne of the highest, of every idle
word and work we ymagyn or do during our aboade in this transitorye vale,
whereof this fair MANTVA fearinge no less to fall into the danger of that
evil, then careful to prevent all occasions of the same, would not admit any
dispense or abstinence of travail, saving of the hollydaies which she used as
seasons of honest recreacio^ in the open feldes amongst other her co^pagnio^s,
detestyng unlawful haunts and secret chattinge with men in corners, the chefest
mean to bring their name and doing in question, for she that abandoneth the
company of her companions, forsakinge the place of public assembly, to retire
into the desolate and dark corners of the chamber, does not only bring her
doyngs in doubt, but also settes the sclanderer of work, to forge a thousand
informacions against her former title and name of honesty, how clear and
strong so ever it seamed in the judgment of all the world, and what other
opinion is to be had of her, that delites in secret conference, hatyng to have
her sayngs proceed in public, then that she treates of other affayers then
she may well justify, for if she lived as she ought, and used none other
terms then were to be aduouched, she neade neither fear ye creaking of ye
door, nor use obscure and dark vaults as only witnesses of her talk, whereof I
could enlarg the proff with authority of antiquity, if the misery of our
present time, did not prefer examples sufficient, which I wish may so instruct
ye careless mothers of England, that keeping their daughters within the awe of
correction, they make the^ also subject to the law and order of good
government, least both the one and the other, become the wonder of ye
multitude, and cause of folysh enterluds devised on public stage by the like
occasions, but now to our Iulya, whose chaste and upright order of living, being
yet fresh within the memory of our age, and not to be defaced with the length
of time, serves also as a line to lead you young Ladies, to direct your lives
(as nere as you can) by the dyall of her virtues: for she treading thus both
the stepps of honest traueile, and traded in the path of true perfection of
life, divided the week into daily exercises of toil, and necessary affayers
of her father, spending the holy days only in honest recreacion among semely
company in the church yard or other convenient place of public assembly,
where being unhappily spied of a detestable palliard and common enemy of the
honor of women, was suddenly so^moned by the sentence of her destines, and fell
by no less misfortune, into ye danger of a fleshly lover, for at ye same
instant, the noble Loys gonsaga the^ bishop of the douchy of Mantua, kept his
residence at Gazolo, where amongst his train of household gentlemen there was
one, who seruyng the bishop in the office of a vallet of his chamber, hadd been
no less worthy of the credit of that rowmthe, then of greter preferment at
the hands of his master, if he had not been unhappily encou^tered by the
desaster which this history pre se^ts unto you: but what? a small spot stains
a faier garment, and one vice that is detestable darkneth the credit of a
number of virtues, it is to be noted (as I have said) yt in Italye ye meeting
of youth and daunsing is tolerable, so it be in the view and eye of the
people, but whatsoever other men do think of ye art of daunsing, I am
persuaded that it is rather a discipline devised within the scoole of Satan,
then an exercise mete to encourage youth to thimitacio^ of virtue wherein I
appeal to justify my opinion, to the fruit and effects appearing daily in
that lasciuius trade, and leuing a part the inuectiues and infinite examples
which the histories on both parts do infer in detestacion of that wanto^
allurment or provocation to sin, I thought it sufficient to confirm my advise
only with the authority of the Roman, who diswading al men from the exercise
of daunsing, says that the countenance, gestes and other behauyors of a
daunser, do nothing differ from the order and disposicion of a fool: here
this valet of chau^ber to ye bishop, being vnhappelie present in an asse^bly of
youth, espied by the like milfortune, the order and behauior of Iulia, who
albeit, she was ye porest of the company, yet was she nothing inferior to ye
best in semely grace and womanly order appearing in her during ye time of the
dance, which infectyng already the eyes of the galla^d of FERRARA, moved him
also with present desire to go nere and take a better view of her beauty, which
he was not hable to consider with such judgment and assured stay of him self but
the glymering complexion of her face dyed with a natural coolor of white and red,
made such a breach into his heart, that wearing the picture of her beauty in
the botome of the same, proclaimed her, without further advise, yt soueraygne
Lady of his life, and only mysters and ruler of his thoughts, and aduowing
herewt to yeald her the whole honor of his service, protested in secrett to
himself, with like vow and ceremonye of vain conceyte, not to leave the
pursuit of such a pray, till he had made a conquest of that he ymagined, and
encountered theffect of his desire, by wearyng the garland of the flower and
first fruits of the maidenhedd of IVLYA, whom because he stood on thorns til
he had presented the first ernest penie of his service, he requested too
dance, which not knowing the cause of his courtesye, she refused not to do,
as one no less ready too perform all requests and affairs of cyuilitie and
good bringing up, according to her calling, then excellyng all the rest of
her time in beauty and other virtues without exception, but if this fond
younglynge and pupil of CVPIDO did feel before, the simple mocions of love,
beginning too tickle him but with desire only to vewe her at large, yt is
now that he resygned himself wholly into the danger of him who as a subtle
serpent, lies in wait to invade them Love.
whom he fyndes unarmed with virtue, laughing afterward to him self at our
redynes to lysten to the lure of his bayte, and run hedlonge into the
laborynthe of endless dysquyet, and that which brought more oil to his match,
and kyndled in his heart the present sparks of hot affection, was, when he
felt the tenderness of her hand, which albeit was every day dipped in diverse
unwholesome confections, and always bare, tabide the violence of the wether, not
refrayninge the hardness or hard labor of any toil, retained such a dilicate
softnes and natural hew of it self, that it seamed equal (for the fynes and
smothnes of skyn) to some Ladies which I know) are assisted with the help of
waters and lee made for the nonce, and other legerdemeins devised by the
potticarye, to preserve their hands, in a continual moisture with a fine white
and pleasant show The pleasant reflection of her ladylike hand, which during
the dance he failed not too graspe as often as he durst, gave such encrese
to the war already begone, renewinge the combat of his thoughts with such
fresh supplies of affection, that he found himself so much to weak to
menteine war with one of the gretest lords of the world, that giving place to
his present fortune, he resigned the fortress of his former quiet, and became
prisoner to him, who would not be content with any other ransom, then the
loss of his liberty duringe his pleasure: and albeit the poor gentleman
(felinge to great an extremytie in this first passion) would gladly have
resigned his preferment and not pursewed the sequel or follow the chase, yet
whether it were ye small experience he had in the skole of love, or the angrye
dome of his destinies, that would not dismiss him without the reward of his
folly, or whether the foggy myste of found affection, hadd so seeled the eyes
of his mind, that he saw himself, denied the assistance of any mean to
redeem him from the yoke of his new bondage, or what yt was, the sequel of
his ill fortune, may argue sufficiently his folly, but well I know, that for
a disease of so strange disposicion, he lacked his necessary medycine, being
no less deceived in the credit of his own wytt, in seeking to quench and
mortify the fire already burst out into flame, by geuinge skope to his eye, to
feed contynually upon her, whom he knows to be the cause of his grefe,
neither did he other good to him self then cast water upon hot coals,
dobling the rage of his affection, by the desire he had to be contynually in
her company, he ought rather to have abandoned the place with the presence of
his enemy at the very first alaram and offer of thassault, dismissinge the
remembrance of her beauty affore it made any breach in his heart, for he that
is unhappily fallen into the danger of love, must not keep war with the
remembrance of her, that has enchaunted him, nor pur sewe the view of her
beautye with a continual gaze or regard of his eye, but rather eschewing the
place and presence of his mystris (two common enemies to his quiet) seek to
subdue the rage of his passion with long absence and far distance of his
abode, wherein he must seem so precise to cure so strange a disease, that if
unhappily he come within the aier of the place where she is, he stand so suerly
upon his guarde, that she once glaunce not upon him with a glimeryng sommonce
of her flattteringe eye, considering that in the verey eye and look of a
woman, does lurk an infection of such drawyng virtue, that one simple object
or glance of ye same, being sufficient to pearce through ye armor of his
resista^ce, is also hable to bring him eftesones under the yoke of her awe,
But this foolish Ferrarois rather resolved in his evil, and contented with his
choice, then desierous to retire in time, or hable (as it seemed) to sho^ne the
peril of ye loss of his liberty, gave place to his present fortune, and
entered the listes, as thrall or captive to the beauty of Iulya, with who^ after
thend of ii. or iij. daunces, he began to devise and discourse of love in this
sort: if the record of diverse histories of old time, together The ge^tlema^

with the present view of sundry familiar examples at this day, did not so
amply describe the power of love, and partly instruct me touching his order
and disposition. I should seem no less amassed at the mystery of his trau^ce,
then I feel my self unhappily encountered with the messenger of his behest, and
justly (me think) may we commence complaint against nature, who framing us
of a brickel and delicat metal, made us rather incident and apt to incur
every danger of the flesh and peril of temptacio^, then armed us with choice
of means to resist the ordinary assaults of the world, whereof (says he) I
may exclaim with good authority above the rest, saying that since ye view
of your presence in this place I am fallen into the prooffe of the like peril:
for as I have hitherto enjoyed the benefit of a most pleasant liberty, being
no less froo from all assaults of fond affection, then void to desire to
commend my service to the best Lady of them all, So since my gredye and
unhappy eyes seized with such assurance upon your beautye, taking with large
view, the full measure of al your parts, and making present report thereof to my
heart and other the inward parts of me, I have sustained such hoate alarams
between my liberty and desyer to do you service, that being no longer hable
to restore the feighte for want of fresh supplies, am here come under your
lee, presenting my self the prisoner of your beauty, wherein albeit, I can not
by any merit of mine own, crave an expedicion of favor by justice, yet do I
not dispaier that you will suspend my delivery, seeing my passion is of no less
importance then either thabridgeme^t or prolo^ging of my lif, persuading my
self with this special comfort, that under the veil of so rare a beauty, there
can not lurk any disposicio^ of long cruelty: but she detesting no less his
pepered persuacions, then loathinge to spend long time in so vain an
argument, replied no less wyselye then with terms of virtue, measuring her
answer with the shortness of time she meant to devise with him: it is hard sir
(says she) to judge a difference Iulya answers.
between your unseemly discurtesye, and the argument of your present follye,
saying both the one and the other importe a semblable meaning of dishonestye,
neither are they both void of equal reproach to your own estimacion.

And albeit your endeavor in such affairs ought not be answered but with
terms of public exclamacio^, to thend the office of infamous sklanders might
yealde you the worthy reward of your trauaill, yet because the punishment
of shame for this one offense, shall not take away the hope of amendment and
future grace in you, I am content to make counsel of the fault, and dismiss
you with free forgeuenes of the fact, wherein as the remembrance of your
example shall hensfurth warn me, to take heed to the subtle charms of other,
not differynge from you in disposition, so let it suffice you, that I make
scilence of your offense, without other rebuke to so great a disorder, with
this further request, that this gentill repulse may rather importe a credit to
my virtue, than provoke you eftesones to give the like charge of mine honor,
which I hold no less dear, then the greatest Lady of our country, neither
shall you find my chastetye less pure then my pouertye virtuous, which
albeit made the galland somewhat amassed for the time, yet as a valyant
souldyor, that will not leave the assault for one repulse gave a second charge
with these terms, if you seame in this sort to prononce the sentence of my
death, (says he) and suffer your cruelty to commit me to the hands of fatal
execucion, the world will note you a monster and enemy to nature, and God
sewer, will call for a reackonning of so foul and cruel an act: the malice of
the world (says she) is not so great nor parciall in this respect, as to
yield me infamy in defending mine honor, and nature is abused when we lose so
precious a gift, and touching any account to make before God, I think my
soul shall stand in more danger in condescendyng to your request, then if
you wylfullye dye by your own follye, wherefore I advise you, for end, to
give over the pursuit of so vain au enterprise, and seek to bestow your
trauail, where there is hope of better success, and amongst such, as making a
common merchandise of their honor, will not stick to set it of sale to such
as bid most for it, for my part, I am no less Jealous of mine honesty, then
careful to keep in entyer the name of my poor parents, neither shall mine
honor be sold for other valewe, then the price of my life, which last
words albeit, argued to the gentleman a great unlikelihood to come to the
effect of his desire, with no less impossibility to shake the fortress of
her chastetye or make a breach into a castle of so valiant defense, yet
would not he for all that, give place to dispare, but retiryng to thassistance
of a new devise, he learned the common haunte of his mystris goinge and
coming from the feelde, as occasion of her business did call her, where he meti^g
her, more often the^ he was welcome, forgott not eftesones to commend unto her
the remembrance of his cause, with a redress of his grefe, hoping with the
help of his importunity, and assistaunce of time to remove yt stone from her
stomach, and procure a pleasant thawe to the frozen heart of this pore cotier,
wherein he gained no less then if he had spent so much time in nombring the
small sands that couers the deserts of Arabia, in so much that she willed him
now for all, to rest co^te^ted with that he had don, and press her no
further, for (says she) so long as my soul and body shall keep house
together, I will make such a Jewel of mine honor, that there shall never
frivolous lover have interest or authority, to dispose of it, neither will I
give so large a skoape or liberty to my unruly affections, as the pre cious
flower of my chastetye shall be a pray, or at the disposition of any, but such
as it shall please thalmightie to join with me in marriage, wherefore go open
the pack of your tromperie in a market convenient for your purpose, and
consider your calling with the profession of your master, who ought to train
you in such sort, as you may rather appear true patterns and images of
virtue, then ministers of knavery, sekyng to seduce poor maids of the
country, who living in the fear of God with no less care of their honest
name, ought not to listen to the lure of love, or keep vain chat with
companions like to your self, but following the discipline of virtue, to
sustain our honest pouertye with the travail of our hands, which is the
portion, appointed God.
to us by him, whom I beseech so mortify this rage of your follye, that
hereafter I may live in peace, and se you restored to the use of your former
senses, but he being none other then the slave of follye, disposed whollye to
feed upon the humor of his affections, had no other thought then to devise
how to enjoy the first fruits and pleasant iewiste of the virginity of
chaste Iulya, who the less acco^pte, she seamed to make of his greef, the
greater grew his desir to pursue her, which he failed not still to perform
with more vehemency then before, publishyng his affection by the sound of a
number of doleful sighs, accompanied with tears, of such pitiful regard,
that they seamed sufficient to pearce a heart wroughte on the forge of flinte or
steel.

But who is hable to corrupt the chastetie ofher that has her heart armed with
assurance in virtue? or what is he that either with the smoth style of his
pleasant tongue, or suttletye in sleintes and fine devises or other
legerdemeins of folly, can make so strong a charm to enchaunt the constancye
of a woman resolved in the fear of god, with desire to were a crown of
ymortalitie by the renown of her honest life, but it is to be resisted by a
special confidence in god and assurance in her virtue: the pure and holly
virgins in time past whose names be registered in the book of fame, have not
they been strongly assailed? with semblable assaltes and yet without shot or
shed of blodde they have prevailed above the malice of them yt undertook to
rob them of ye everlasting glory of their virginity, and suerly there is no
malice of man so great, nor devise so detestable, that stands not in awe and
stowpes in the presence of true virtue, neither can it pearce and much less pos
sesse any heart, but that which he fyndes unarmed of a faith and fere in god,
who will neither suffer his servant to be tempted above his power, nor see him
oppressed long with the malice of ye wicked. Here may the slaunderer have
wherewith to stop his mouth and be brought to believe by famyliar proof, that
virtuous women have better means to resist the vein importunities of love,
the^ the wicked and evil disposed have reason to seek to seduce the honor of
their chastity, and if by des tenye or ill fortune it happen that some one
forget her selfs so far, that she falls unhappily into the danger of the
temptor, let her falte and shame be peculiar to herself and not stain the
rest with the reproach of her follye, for it is no rea son that when any thing
chances amys, all men become guilty of the falte, no more then when one man
among a number, incident to the like desaster, becoms a thief or the worker of
some other heinous offense, ought to infect other with thinfamy due to him
self, or ympart the penance of the fact amongst other that himself only
deserves, for nature making us all of one mettell, has given us
indifferentlye a semblable perfection, with special decree, that every man
should be noted and judged as he is, willing wythall, that if any of her
creatures do unhappily declyne, that he alone bear the reproach of his own
fact, and not to admit it for a consequent, that the whole number should be
spotted with thimperfection of one: besides in the beginning when syn seized
first upon man, albeit it is to be supposed, that it took like possession of
the woman, being made his companion and associated unto him by the will of God,
yet have we no reason or mean to persuade that they are either inferior in
virtue, or more apt to fall then we, neither ought we do them that wrong, in
estemynge themlesse weak the^ our selves, or more subject to syn the^ the
most and best assured of us all, saying we find them longer in breath and
use more assurance in with standing the sensual prouocations of the flesh,
then we have reason to assault them with the like alarams, and truly he geues
more argument of his fragilitie and weak resistaunce, who at the first
assault and mocion of his wanton affections, does yield himself prisoner to
thappetit of his will, with intent to pursue thend of his lascivious desire,
then she, that resisting of long time, the hot alarams of his vehement
requests, is driven at last unwillingly to resign the keys of her for tresse,
more peradventure to prevent the danger of dispaier in him, whom she sees,
redye to die for her sake, then for any desire to content thappetite, of her
own will, and yet can not she escape the malice of suspicion, nor merit the
name of perfet constancy, that is overcome with any enchantement how strong
so ever it be, for that she can not bear the title of true virtue, onles she
remain invincible to the^de, waighi^g her honor and life in indifferent
balau^ce, whereof al ladies may behold a familiar prof in this mirror and Iemme
of co^stancy Iulya, who the more she was pressed and courted with the pepered
alureme^ts of ye valta^t souldior of love, the more did she rampire her self
in assurance of virtue, seaming valiant in the defense of a fort that was
inexpugnable, which ministrynge nothing but a present dispaier to him to
preualle by any pollicyes before devised, drive him to resort to thassistance
of the pernicious and common mean used ordinarily by the detestable palliard
that can not other ways deceive the symplicitie of honest maids, and which
as an infection worse then the air of the pestilence, does corrupt the greenes
of youth before it be confirmed with experience and discrecion: I mean a she
bawd (whereof Paris has less want then choice or store of honest women)
which coyffed with a visor or cloak of fained hollynes, and masqued wholly with
a mofler of Hypocricy, seamyng to the world, to mortifye her body with iij.
or iiij. solemn fastes in the weke, watchinge in devout manner at the church
doare for the devotion and aims of the people, and caryinge in her hand a
baudy baskett, rather to coolor her villanye, then to serve her necessary
turn, becoms the collcaryour between the lover and his trol, making a match
no less odyous in the eye of the world, then detestable before the throne of
the highest, becominge by this means the first seducer of the^, that before the
offer of her charms of painted allurement, were peradventure no less void of
such ymaginacion, then free from intent ever to commit so foul an act, and
yet use they such secret slight in the conueighe of their business, that the
finest wits can hardely espy them, and the best ties had need of spectacles
to discover their trade: but what is it that love can not find out, whose eyes
albeit be so percyng of them selves that they will penetrat and find a whole to
peep out, of the strongest and closest tower in a countreye, yet has his art
such a gift of reuelacion in this case, that there is no mean how secret so
ever it be, but he geues informacion of it to him that traffiques in his
affairs, with intent to advance theffect of his desire, wherein this vallett
of chamber forgetting neither rule nor instruction, gat him in have to this
double doxye and solemn Hypocryte, whom he knew to be an ordinarye solyci^^y:
in the like affairs, and a redye phisicio^ to cure all dise (...) of his
importance: he first coniures her in any wise to make council of that which
he meant to communicate unto her, and then to assiste his greef with the
uttermost of her diligence, wherewith she saying even now as far into his
disease as his physician did into his urine, castyng alredye in her head what
mark the poor lover would shoot at, began to prefer a certain difficultye to
promise either the on or the other, alleging that if his request should tend
to the hurt or disadvantage of her conscience, his labor were lost any further
to pursue the assistaunce of her god will, for says she I had rather dye with
the note of honest name which hitherto I have kept then upon the end of my
years, do the thing with my body that in the other world might bring my
soul in hazard of grace before him, whom it behoues me not to offe^de: but
the subtle lover who knew well enough that her trade consisted in the conueighe
of bawdye errandes, and that the body and souls of such filthes were no less
subject to corrupcion, then their hypocrisye and veil of hollynes detestable,
brake with her in few words of the cause of his coming, desyryng her in any
wise not to dissemble her endeavor on his behalf, addinge for a further
circomstaunce, that she should reap a thankful reward of her travail,
wherein because he knew that money was the next mean and only key to open the
devout heart of this mo^ster, and that such she apes and goolphes of iniquitye
have no other God but the geine of their abominable trade, let fall into her
lapp some iij. or iiij. ducats, whose first vewe prevailed so much and had
such power to convert this painted Image, that without further entreatie, she
removed the veil of her first hardness and aduowed her self the handmaide of
his behest, willing him to live in hope and repose him self wholly upon her
diligence, whereof says she, I doubt not to present the such spedie effect
as within few days the joy yt thou shall feel by the encounter of thy
desire, shall far excede the languishyng grief of thy (...) passion, and
thusmuche I will promise the further, (...) if she be but a woman and not
possessed with any part of a devil (as many of us be) I will so conjure her
with charms and enchauntmentes of my art, that of her self she shall offer
thee the possession of that which heretofore thou could never win by power
or policy, but take head my son says she, that this be mom, and my endeavor
not discovered to any, for as pytty more then other respect, has moved me to

to practyse so badd a trade, so I would not for the price of all I have, that ye
world should understand I were a broaker in a busynes so far unmeet for mine

fear of that be any ympediment to your diligence, for I am no less careful
of your reputacion then desirous to see theffecte of your promise, wherein I

such sort, as the reward of your trauail herein shall be a relefe to you and
yours so long as you live, well well says this old hagg, I will try your
courtesy, and your self shall be witness of my diligence, wyshing you no less
willing to perform but the one half of your liberal offer, then I dout not
to deserve yt with speed, for if ever one woman had power to overcome an other,
I make my account, that she shall not escape my hands, till I have taught her
such a dance as she never learned in her life, wherewith she dismissed ye
seely fool of FERARA, quarelling with his unquiet thoughts and yet in some
hope to be helped by thassistance of his old Darioletta, and broker of bawdry,
and she repaired ymediatly to her charge: and watching her time to execute the
same wherein she was furthered by a help of fortune, who favored this

thy age and calling, consists and co^mes chefly by her courteous behavior to
every man? and that of the contrary part, she is pointed at of the world, that
seminge to stand altogether upon her slippers, reiectes the honest offers of
courtesy and frindshipp, arguing by that means her haggard and rude
disposicion, wherein as the chefest point of commendacion of us women depends
upon certain terms of courtesy and shows of friendship, So are we chefly
bound to make declaracion of the same on the behalf of them that seem to

upon a man with no less force then the hot reflection of the Son, persynge
each thing upon earth subject to his heat, does make him strike sail and
seek to be guided by the glymerynge light of such twinkling stars forcing
him with all to pursue your favor with the fra^ke offer of his humble service,
so you are not only bound to appear reciprocal in affection, but also yield
them the dew mede of so great a martyrdom deryued of causes in your self,
and not refuse to be courted with young men or mislike their endeavor in
seeking to win by their service the glory of that which the sommonce of your
eyes does half promise them, wherein although they are partly guided and
stirred by nature, yet are they chiefly allured and set on fire by the
influence of your beautye, our age beside is not void of experience how diverse
maids being honored with their service and affection of sundry gentlemen of
no small account, have seemed rather rashely to refuse the profer of such
frindshypp, then rightly wayghe the meryt of their curtesye, and after
receyuynge the due sentence of their crueltye, have not only doated upon such,
as took pleasure in their grief, and laughed at their follye, but also
deserved not (for any gift that was in them) to receive the favor of one
simple regard of the eye, which as it is to be noted to proceed of yt just
vengeance of that God who first stirs in us the mocions of such frindshipp,
So are we warned (in embracing the contrary) to eschew the peril of
semblable accidents. And for your part being no less fortunat then the best
of any age heretofore, and honored with no less true affection then duetyful
service of one that is redye to pawn his living, honor and all that he has
for the interest of your good will, I marvel you regard so lyghtlye the
reward of so great a virtue, and use so small care in curyng your own
disease, which because you dare not declare, does make a secrett martyrdom of
your florishyng youth: albeit for end, if you will willynglye embrace the

the evil, then to find a true pattern of virtue, neither is pure gold known
by his glysterynge coollour, nor that religion perfect that smells of
supersticion exposyng fruits of execrable corrupcion and sensual conspiracies,
is this the good council you give to the youth of GAZOLO? is this the example
of virtue or instruction of honesty which is to be expected in the number of
your years? have you thus long blayred the eyes of the world with a masque of
Fained hollynes, and now retires to the vomett of your hypocrisy with entente
to seduce her who is no less assured in virtue then you unworthy to enjoy
the benefyt of life in abusyng your dewtie toward God and deceyuing the
opinnyon and expectacion of all men: Albeit my poverty be great and my parents
of less ability to releue me, yet has God so endowed me with the gift of
thanckfull contentacion, that my estate with contynuall use of honest travail
is no less plesannt to me the^ ye dilicate order full of superfluite of vain
pomp used by great Ladies now a days wantonlye norished in pallays and places
of princes, being more ready to ro^ne under the danger of a thousand torments
yeldyng death his tribute with the sacrifyce of my body then to lay my
chastity in pawn (as you persuade me) for thinlarging ye hard condition of my
self or state of my poor parents neither have I hitherto felt any mocio^ of
that folly which you call love, and much lessemene I to make any experience
of his flatteryng offers how great so ever they appear wherefore let yt suffice
you, to have broached the vessel of your villainy before her, that in respect
of your years is contented to comytt your filthye message to scilence, wyshyng
you hensfurth to broake in matters of more honesty, or at ye least to seek to
solicit such, as are as careless of their honor as you ready to seduce it, for
my part, I have weighed min honor and life in indifferent ballaunce, with
intent to exchange both the on and the other at equal price, and as for the
galland yt sent you, he makes true declaration of the love he bears me, in
semyng more desyerous to enjoy the pleasure of my body, then careful to
preserve mine honor, or prevent the danger of my soul, and you as ye
unnatural bourrea^ suborned to subvert the chefest orname^t of my life, are
content to become his messenger and minister, and under the coollor of
deuacion, to communicate matters of bawdry, so for his part, let him keep that
he has won, and pay him self with ye tribut of his own folly for I am not
only resolved he^sfurth once to speak to him but also to shonne the place where
he is, as a venomous serpent and ravenous wolf, rather desyerous to make
marcha^dise of my body, then careful any way of my reputacio^, wishyng you
also for end, to depart ye place least your long taryeng yield you the due
reward of your travail, which sharp repu^se and last threats so amassed the
bawd and nipped her, in ye head yt although she were more excellent in ye gyfts
of an orator then belo^ged to one of her trade, yet durst she neither trust
the smoth and sugared style of her tongue, in excusinge the cause of her coming
nor seem eftesones to credit the fynes of her wytt, in deuisyng new charms
to enchaunt the pudicitie of the maid, but as one no less ashamed of that she
had don, then fearing to be discovered and committed to shame, retired with
less noise the^ joy of her message, leuynge Iulya reioysyng the goodness of
her Fortune that had delivered her so saffelye from the perils of so great a
mischief, persuadynge her self hensfurth to use the pollycye of the serpent
in stoppynge her ears, least with the assistaunce of time and liberty to
here her speak, she might unhappely fall into the danger of her charm, wherein
she seemed to observe ye rule of wisdom, which bidd all women of honest part
the cacquett or company of the^ that go about to corrupt their chastetie,
saying that she yt willingly admittes and listeneth to the infectious that of
such devouring cater pillars, semes in ye judgment of ye world to be of
disposition ready to obey their loare, and what great battery need we, to beat
that fortress, whose captain demands a parley and seweth for composition,
but what was the passion all this while of the poor Ferrarois of not such as
commonly is incident to them that languishe of the like desease, for waftinge
indifferently between hope and dispaier he seemed more redye to incurr the
danger of the on, then hable to convert the benefyte of the other into a help
for himself, wherein he was the rather furthered by the report of his bawd,
who, denied to perform any perte of her promise and less hable to answer his
exspectation, returned as it were with a flea in her ear and being no less
ashamed of yt she had don, the^ doubtful to proceed any further, seemed with ye
report of her cold success, to pronounce the extreme sentence and final
arrest of his life, but love, who first stirred up the humor of his folly,
undertaking to be his guide, during ye conueigh of this buysines would not leave
him alone in the middeste of his pagaunte without sufficient matter to treat
upon, neither thought he it time to present the catastrophe or dismiss him
from the stage till he had played the uttermost act of his folly, wherefore
fedyng the fondling with vain suggestio^, and dandlynge him stilwt diverse
arguments and likelyhodes of good success, offered therewith the assistaunce of
a new devise, which was, that seeing prayers could not prevail nor
importunityes take place and ye fra^ke offer of his continual service not only
refused but resolved her so depely in the disdain and hate of his remembrance,
that she abhorred his company no less then the presence of the Cockatrice or
baselyke serpent, he should retire to thatte^pte of money, as a sure help to
supply yt weakness of his former devises, whose force albeit is so great, yt
of it self it is hable to pearce the strongest tower of a kingdom, being the
chefest engine as the poets feign that opened Jupiter the doare of the brazen
tower wherein the faier daughter of Achrises was curiously kept, yet has it no
power to approach the pallais of virtue, and less hable to invade or make any
breach into the heart confirmed in pure chastity, whereof our poor Iulya has
left an undoubted example to all degrees of future succession, for she resolved
wholly in ye true ymitacio^ of virtue, rejected al offers of filthy gain
acco^pting the contentment of the mind to excede all the riches of the world,
neither thought she her worthy of due veneracion nor meet to be admitted in
the feloshypp of the tried sort, that with aconsta^t proof of their faith do
not make their chastity of as great admiration, as the frugilitie of man
semes great in doting upon a beauty that fades as a shadow and of less
continuance then a flower, but now to your Vallett of chamber who somewhat
reuyued with a new hope of goodlucke in the sequel of this second devise,
preferred yt ymedyatly to execucion, and encoraging the bawd with the offer of
his hope, instructed her eftesones with new terms more vehement to persuade
then likely to speed, and so dismissing this second embassage commites her to
the goodness of fortune, here mother be, laden with money and Jewels, retires
again to her former trade of shame, where marching with no less courage then
hope of good speed, thought her self armed with sufficient wepons to enter the
fortress and to put the prisoner into the possession of him that desired
nothing so much as to enjoy the pillage of so precious a pray, albeit she
fisshed afor the nete and made her reckoning without her host, for as soon as
she comes to the cottage of Iulya and began to enter into the preamble of her
embassage opening with all the bore of her merchandise and Jewels, the maid
abhorring no less the company of ye bawd, then lothing the sight of ye
ministers of corrupcio^, could not so bridle her humor of just anger, but
interrupting her bablyng discourse, she seized in have upon ye Iewls and other
presents which without respect of Money the mynisters of corrupcion.
their value, she cast into the midst of the street, imparting the like
courtesy to the lewd bringer whom she took by the sholders and thrust out of
her house with threats, that if she aduentred eftesones to come thither, she
would present her with her message affor the Lady marquise, who hated such
trolls and corrupters of youth, as a pestilence or worse infectio^, sayng
besides, yt he yt sent her gave sufficient proof of his folly in seking to
seduce her by money and presents, yt took no pity of his tears and former
complaints of dolor, neither was he less vile to think to buy her with
money, that is not to be sold but by the price of virtue, then she detestable
afor God and the world that mesureth her honor by the price of her profit,
warnyng her (as for all) hensfurth to desist for fear of the reward of shame,
and he to rest contented with the wrong he had already don without pressing her
any further to put his falte and punishment in publicacion, which last threats
stroke such a fear into the heart of the old hag with a present dispaier to
prevail any way in the pursuit of her quest, that being only glad to escape
so well the danger of her deferuing, she retired in have to the seely Ferraroys
to whom (in place of good news or pleasant report of her success) she
mynistred perswacions to correct his fancye and forgett to love such one as
makes no account of his service, willing him withal, to plant his affection in
some better soil, upon such one as were not brutishe or void of reason to
requyt the meryt of his service, for says she, thies beasts and impes
whithout wit or order of civility, do also lack discresion to consider in
cases of love, or yield the due meede of true affection, neither can they
degenerat from the climat of their base descent, or do other thing then such
as the wilful loare of their folly does lead them unto, and being favored (as
it were of nature) with the gift of a certain beauty, which bringes them in
estimacion amongst men, they are so assotted in the humor of self will, that
they seem rather to abuse the benefyte of so precious a Jewel, then worthy to
wear so rare an ornament, and for this (says she) that will not be moved
with prayer nor present, nor any devise serve to reclaim her haggard mind
seaming but to quarrel with all offers of courtesy, I cannot thyncke, but it is
some hard rock converted in the shappe of a woman or figure of beauty, to
become the tyrranouse tormenter of them that unhappily are sommoned to serve
her, wherefore seeing I am denied to assist you by my travail, according to my
promise, I pray you let me advise you to stop the course of affection, and
choke the channel of your love affore yt ouerflowe the hope of recovery, and
cease any longer to feed the humor of your passion with the remembrance of
her, that semes to take pleasure in your gryef: well well says the dolorous
lover, I would I could as easily forget, as you are apt to perswad, or that
you had thusmuch advised me before you gave me assurance of relyef by your
dylygence, but chyefly I wish that I hadd eschued the ill when I admitted the
cause, then had I reserved my lybertye, lived free from passion, void from
unacquainted ertremyties, and not lament to late in this sort, mine own
disaster, nor stand neade^ to communicate with you who sells your advise
for money and makes your travail the merchant of filthy gain, albeyt
seeing want of discresion has styrred up this error, and the folly of youth
prevailed above the force of wisdom, I must be driven to make of necessytye a
law, and give place to ye sentence of my present fortune, greuing not
withsta^dynge that the frendshyppe and undoubted zeal of affection which I bare
her, should reap the fruts of rigor and receue the meryite of their virtue at
the hands of cruelty: at the least I will not so despair but that the argument
of a future hope shall keep me in breathe, and expectyng the benefytt of a
better time, I will comitt my self to the government of patience, who as I have
hard is the only tuche stone to try a man that is fallen into terms of
affliction. But here the galland seemed rather to feed the time, then bynd
himself to perform theffecte of his own words, neither mente he to suffer
his last resolution to pass for current money and much less to content him
self with his cards, seeing he lyked not his game, and seeing he cold not
prevail by pollicye nor win the fort by somonce or offer of composicion, he
determined (as his last help) to use the vttermoste of his forces and
perform his conquest what so ever yt cost him, But thusmuch by the way, there
is nogreate enterprice, to what end so ever it tend, whether yt be guided by
virtue or conducted by vice, whose effect can answer therpectacion of
thinuentour, unless there be a roumthe reserved for a third to perticipate
therein, as well for the erpedicion of the cause as suer conueyghe of the
mysterye: so this vallet of chamber, resolved absolutely in the pursuete of
his queste imparteth the discourse of his love passed, his synyster success in
the same, his diverse assalttes too the forte, and his fundrie and sharp
repulses, too a dashbuckler of the bushops, who made no more conscience to be
a minister of evil, then ye outlawes of shooters hill use courtesy in stripping
our merchants, and after send them to London with penyles budgettes, he
forgate not also to make him preuye to his last resolucion, crauyng therein
the assystaunce of his fryndeshyppe, in such sort, as upon thynstant he made
him aduowe the same to thuttermoste of his power, only says he, devise the
way, and my diligence shall declare the zeal I bear thee, with the desire I
have too place thee in the bosom of thy felicity: yt were a folly says
this desperate lover to reiterate the order of my former devises, and to present
her eftesones with offices of courtesy, it were but time lost, only there
restes to offer her the rack I mean to oppress her with force, neither do I
care what penny worths be made of my life, so that I may in any sort, revenge
the obstinate cruelty of her, who peradventure after the first taste of the
pleasant Iewystes of love, will slack the bridle of her rigor, and convert the
hard and angrye clymate of her invincible humor, into a disposicion of less
difficulty and she easier hereafter to be entreated, neither would I The

have the to respect the danger or impossibility of the^ terprice, considering
the beginning of al things importe a certain difficulty but after the oncet
is given, the worste is paste and no cause of fear or doubt remaynes, but
waighinge the pleasure thou shall do me, ymagine also how depely thou shall leave
me in thie debte, which will stody to requite yt with the like and all I have
else that may stand the in stead wherwyth he prevailed so much over the
vyperous inclynacion of his cotreatur, that albeit he knew his consent wear
not so wicked, as ye doing of ye act more detestable, yet waighi^g ye preset
offer of his friendship, with the great authority he had with the bishop, and
forgetinge the duty of his conscience, confirmed eftsoon his consent,
willinge the desolate lover to take heart at grass and repose himself
chiefly upon the aid of his frendshippe, and because says he, the chief
conveighe of this mystery consistes in the consent of conuenyente time and
place, let it be youer whole endeavor to watch whenne she goes into the
fields alone, to thend that in vsinge our advantage, we may have time to do
our feate without dread or danger of any: this was not so soon agreed upon
between them two, as theffect followed with the expedicion of a momente, for the
crafty lover marked diligently the hours and times of her ordynary labors,
neither cold she haunt so secret a place but his eye was redye to discover her,
and so lyeng in ambushe in the way of her usual trade to the corn feldes, had
her at last brought to his stale, which after he had imparted to his marrow,
they sailed not to follow the trace in as soft and subtle manner as the wily
for, who when he coms to spoil the powltrye of the fermor is so circumspecte
in his doing, that the least noise of the world makes him take a bu^he til
his fear be passed So this ferrrarois and his fellow pursewed the pore maid
by such secret and unknown ways and with a speed more then necessary for
thexecucion of a good and lawful business, that her clyente appeared at her
back, before she was ware, who having no time to spend in circumstaunce
saluted her with the cause of his coming in this sort, if length of time be
the true tuch stone to try a difference between the fained heart and firm
affeccion, you have a sufficient proof of my constancy, or if long service
with sincere loyalty may seem meritorious, you alone can judge my diligence
and I accuse your cruelty, but if the trybute of true frendstippe is to be
paid with a reply of semblable affection, why do you in this sort suspende
my suit, doblinge my passion in denying the thing that is due to me by just
title, how can you thus long keep me in captivity that offers my life for a
ransom, or when I sue for my right, to reward me with cruelty which I have
not deserved and less seminge for one of your calibre and calling? it is time
now to strike sail and remove the veil of your ancyente rigor whereof I have
tasted of long time, and waighynge indifferently the meryt of my martirdom, to
yield me meede accordingly, let me once taste of the virtue of your bownty,
as well as I have hitherto lived under the yoke of your crueltye, so that the
meede of my own deser uing, may at last give end to the evils which I suffer
by your means, wherwyth the poor Iulya, no less amassed at his sodein
encownter in that place then unprovided of an answer to his doubtefull
demand, was driven to reply according to the shortness of her time and
leisure, if you appeal to the length of time for declaracion of your loyal
love and proffe of constancy says she, I crave no other judge of your foul
desire, rather to robb me of that I hold most dear, then to honor me with the
offer of true affeccion wherein I am justified by the diverse disorderly means
which heretofore you have suborned to advance your wicked intent, neither
deserve I of right thimputacion of cruelty and much less of unseemly rigor as
you term it, considering I neither used the one nor the other but as a special
virtue in defense of mine honesty, and touching your passion and torment
procedyng rather by want of discrecion in your self, then occasion onmy part, I
see neither cause to complain your grefe nor reason to releue it, neither can
I answe re you with other terms but commit you to themeryt of your follye, in
wishinge me to give end to your euilis, you press me with more then is in my
power, saying I was neither press to the beginning nor cause of ye
continuance, and much less experienced in the cure of such discases, only I
pray you forbere eftsoon to pursewe me, who being not equal as you have
said in qualytie or calling, is less ready to agree with you in consent, or
fulfill the beastely appetyte of your will, desiringe you for end, to let me
live as I am and not to serve me hensforth with any process of vain ym
portunyties, for I had rather endure the martyrdom of a thousand torments,
then do the thing that mine honor can not justify, where with regarding with
good eye ye fierce countenance of her enemy, arguing ye present troble of his
mind, and fearing withal by the secret instinct of her heart, the nere approach
of an evil torn, began to amend her pace, which also she dobled now and then
as one yt durst not ^on from him that she most abhorred, but he that was loath
to lose the benefyte of so good a time, and less willing to have so sweet a
morsel taken out of his mouth, fained a certain offer of his service to conduct
her to ye town, preferring therwt (as of fresh) diverse requests to take
pity of his passion, which albeit she hard without any answer, yet was it
not in her power to pass the hands of her destiny, which by this time had
brought them into a place convenient for thexecution of his execrable
enterprise far from the town and out of ye ordenary hawnt of company, and that
which best favored his intent in the myddest of a corn field being a covert

persuading her to scilence said, her bravery was to great for one of her
calling, and that they came not thither to take pity of her complaints,

spite and bitter terms of just reproach against him, that lothyng to suffer
her eyes to feed upon him that had infected all the parts of her body, told
him that the only veiwe of his villainous looks made her forgett all order of

touched her with ymputacion in making her incydent to so wretched a destenye,
in exclaiming still upon the malice of her Fortune, if thabundaunce of tears
accompayned with sighs of pytyfull disposicion, hadd not so stopped the course
of speech, that for the time she was driven into scilence, and being by litte
and little restored again to the liberty of her tongue, and the source of her
sorrow somewhat retired, she made a short inuocacion to God in this sort, oh
heuenlye father says she, I see that the rigor of thy justice, has
prevailed above the benefytt of thy mercy, and that thou doste awarde me this
hard penance for the punishment of my faltes passed, with what face alas shall I
behold my poor father whose compfort as it consisted in my well doing, so his
grief will be without comparison, hering of the hard terms of my myschaunce, in
desolacion shall he knitt up the remeynder of his old years that coming into
any place, the remembrance of my falte drawing the blood of shame into his
face will make him blushe and eschew the company, where afor he neded not have
douted to have marched amongst the best, and shall I dissemble that which I
entende not to hydd or keep it secret that touches me so nere, No, no, as
thin^^cencye of my mind is recorded before god, so because the world shall also
witness how clear I was from consent, I will use no other water to wash away so
great a spott then the sacryfice of death, which I will follow with no less
expedicion, then the treason of the villain has been cruel in taking from me
that which made me to live, wherwithe dismissing her complaint, she ceased
also from tears and put herself in order to go to the house of her father,
who (by evil ^ucke) was not then at home: there she puts on the best garment
she had, and attyring her self in order to go to some great meeting or banquet,
shittes the doare of her cotage, and leading her younger sister in her hand,
went furthwith to an awnt of hers, who as one ouercharged with sickness and
years, was not hable to sturr out of her bed, affore whom as she was in the
midst of the repeticion of her chance reueiling the whole order and
circumstance of the fact, which she cold not do without great effusion of
tears, for that the very remembrance of the deed restored a fresh alaram of
her sorrows, she fell sodeinly into a qualme or passion of soundyng, wherein she
remained traunced without all argument of life, til by the help of the
assistance, she was eftsoon delivered to thuse and liberty of her senses,
when quarelling still with the horror of the fact, and desire to be revenged by
death, she seamed to rebuke her own ymbecillitie and faintnes of courage,
saing, what sign of virtue is this to seame to shrink, when arguments of
constancy ought chiefly tappere? who will desire to live, that has lost the
renoume of honor which ought to be the most precious Jewel and badge of the
life, or what pleasure is it to possess the presence of the body already
spotted with infamye, when the soul, weary of her habytacio^, is ready to
resign her ancient aboade? what felicity have they in life, that being the
gaze and wonder of the multitude, cannot claim the privilege of any place,
but the people will point at them? neither can they hyde them in so secret a
corner, but infamye will hunt them out, and shame discover them, atte^ding them
to the very end of their days, no, no, let not them live that are desirous to
dye, and death is most acceptable to such, as hate the fruicion of life: for
my part, I loath already the remembrance of life, seeing I have lost the chefest
pillor of the same, whereof I mean to make spedy declaracion by the sentence I
have already pronounced of my end, wherein it shall appear to the world, that
although my body have tasted of the malice of the wicked by force, yet my
mind remains entire without spott or consentement to the villainy, which as my
chief bequeste and last testament in this world, I leave registered in the
remembrance of you good awnt, to make relacion to my desolat parents and the
whole world besides, of thaccide^t of my wretched desaster, and that although
your unhappy niece and miserable IVLIA has by meare force, lost the outward
show of her honor, yet her conscience remeinyng unspotted, and soul clear,
ready to fly to the heavens to witness her i^tegry tie before the sacred
theatrye or tribunal seat of GOD, can not depart with worthy contentement,
before I offer my life to ye waves, to purify the filthy spots wherewith my
body remeins painted on all parts by thinfection of the detestable rape of
force, wherewith she departed, not taryinge the replye of her awnt, who
thought to have diswaded her from the pursuete of her desperate intent, and
being come to the river of Oglyo, kyssing her sister, with a last cry to god
to receive her soul to his mercy, she lept hedlo^g into July a drovvneth her
self
the water, who as a mercyles element, respectinge neither thinnocency of her
cause, nor desperate order of dying, committed her to the botomles throts and
goolphes of the sourges, which was the end of this miserable IVLIA, whose
life only deserves commendation for thexample of her virtue, and death worthy
to be committed to oblyuyon for the signs of desperacion wherewyth it was
infected. But after this chance burst out into terms, and became the report
of the people, God knows what general desolacion was among all the estate
of the City, as well for the strangnes of the fact, as for that the villeyne
was fledd that caused the brute, who if he had been taken, had don penance of
this falte with the loss of his life in example of others: the body was
found by the diligence of Loys Gonzaga, who would not suffer it to be buried
in the Church yard or other sanctuarye, because of the desperate manner of her
death, but caused it to be solempnelye acco^panyed with the tears and great
dule of diverse Ladies into a place or grave in the field, where he meant in
short time to set up a tomb of marble with a monument of the particular
discourse of the virtues and singular gifts of grace in his pore countrewoma^,
whose death I wish may learn al estats to eschew the peril of dispaier, and
order of life to instruct all the young Ladies of England, to resist the
charms and sugared allurements of love, who the more he is feasted with
pleasant regardes of the eye, or encountered with secret conference in corners,
or courted with embassages, or lastly banqueted with dishes of delicate toys
or vain importunityes, the more is he redye to invade and apt to overcome,
but on the contrary part, the way to keep war with that vaccabound, and to
flee his infections, is (as IVLIA did) to march against him with a flagge of
virtue, vsyng wythall, the pollycy of VLIXES in stopping your ears from the
pepered harmonye of them, that delitinge only in the pray of your outward
beautye, have no respect to the ornament of the soul, which being kept
pure and undefiled to the end, yealdes you a reward of immortalitye, and your
renown never to be rased out of remembrance, till thextreame dissolucion of
the world.

The argument.
THere was never mischief of former time, nor vice in present use, wherein men
are, or have been more drowned, or drawn by a beastly desyer, then in
therecrable and deadly sin of whoredom, by the which besides that, the
spiritual fornicacion is figured in some sort, yet is it forbidden unto us
expressly by thinuiolable laws, not written in the tables, where thauncientes
were wont to grave directions and orders to pollitique states of the Romans,
Athenyens, Egiptiens, or Sparteins, but recorded in theuerlasting book, within
the which, the veraie finger of god, has sealed his infallible statutes, where

made partakers, with desyer and endeavor of ymytacion, so we are al warned by ye
same defense, that besides the wrong and harm we do to our own bodies, we
offend ^eynously against the health of our souls, specially in corruptinge the
wife of our neighbor, with thabuse of that part of her, which is necessary to
be guarded with as great care and watch, as we read was used sometime in the
supersticious ceremonies of the vestals of Rome, in keeping a contynuall fire in
their temple: The greatness also of this sin of adultery, bringing (as you
se) an equal hurt to the soul and body, has forced a wonderful seueretie in
both the laws, punishinge by death Dyuine and human laws.
such as do profane that hollye and invyolable bond and bed of marriage, where
is only a place of purity and no oblacion to be offered or admitted, but the
sacrifice of honest and lawful substance: besides what slanders and
mortality amongst men, have spronge out of the vicious fountain of that
sin, ye marriage bed of Menelaus defiled by ye kings son of Troy, has
left sufficient example, and cause of exclamacion amongst the phrigiens, with
reason to all posterities, to deteste such villainy, as a vice most
abhomynable: in Egypt the Sychemetyens, for like respect under Abraham and
Isaac, have felt the mighty hand of god, although their offense (in some sort
was excusable by ignorance) for that they thought the wives, which they took,
had been unmarried: Likewise, if there be any faith in the poetical fictions,
we see, thargumentes of most of their tragedies, were founded either upon the
punishmente or despair of such, as, not hable to revenge the wrong of their
lasciuions wife and wicked Sathanist her mynyon, convert and execute their rage
and fury upon theimselues, wherein our world at this day, is grown to such a
malicious golphe and bottomless sea of vices, that the wild nations, without
either awe of God, or fear of his laws, governed only by an instinct of
nature, are more curious to keep the honor of their bed, then diverse contryes
in the heart and bowels of Christendom, where thadulteror is not punished but
by protestacion or attorney, and where the poor man that receives the wrong,
is rather iested at, and pointed to with forqued fingers (according to ye
Italyan brag) then he persecuted in any sort, that procures the evil,
which partialitye or rather unlawful favor of the Law and deputies of
justice, serves as a sufficient encouragement both to the one and other
whoremonger, whereupon follows so many morders of husbands, by mean and
hands of their wives, to the end they may pass their amarous practyse, with
more pleasure and less fear, the poyseninge, and drowninge of so many lawful
children, for advancement of those, whose bastard race, is bew tified with a
masqued title of true procreacion, whose end, is sesewerly, matched with
destruction to themselves, and ever lasting dis honor to their parents and
posterity, whereof behold here (you Ladies) a familiar proffe, in the black,
picture or portraytur of this bloddie gentlewoman, who, forgetting the virtue
of her youth worthelie renowned of all men, cold not be satisfied with thabuse
of her age and hoarie hears, touching thincestious prostitucion of her body,
without the number of unnatural morders, wherwyth you may see her tyrannous
hands dyed, and thinnocent souls of her husband and ii. sons, kneling before

IF we may Creditt the reapportes of France and Italye, we need not doubt of
the singularyties of Prouyncia, which, ye chronicles of both contries do
aduowche, to owe nothing to any one corner in Christendom, either for the
glorious s^yte and scituacion of the place, fertilletie and plentye of every
thing, which pleasure or necessetie can wish, rich and stately Cities,
builded with a form of majesty more then the common sort of towns, and
peopled besides, with every sort of cyuilitie, and curteyse inhabytantes, in
the midst whereof, is a little village, called Lagrassa, planted (as it
seames) in a pleasant vale yelding a chiefest beauty and furniture of glory to
the whole platt or circuit of Prouyncia: for it is assisted on every part
with the champaine, furnished with all sorts of delight both by wod and water,
with a glistering glee of the grene meadows, who yield such a contynual
fertilytie, that (if it were not ye deuowring Jaws of their greedy cattal) a
man would think they were specially favored with a spring time at al seasons in
the year: in diverse parts of this herbage, flourishing with blossoms of every
entising flower, shall you see (as it were) certain cloase arbours and open
alleyes, beutified with ye small spraies of lymmo^ trees, oringes, and Granades,
offering to be thankful (with their several fruits) to strangers passing ye way,
with every other graft of pleasant view or taste, dispersed with such order, both
in round, quadra^t and tryangle form, that, only nature her self, is to be
thought the chief woorkemoman in that mystical conueighe, which resembles
rather a second grove or gardyne of Thessalya so much commended by Herodotus,
Plyny, Strabo, besides other of the poetical crewe, then a place of general
haunte, assailed comonlye with passyngers of all sorts, and continually
spoiled by thinhabytantes, who make oppen war, both with the boodds and
branches, fruit and trees of this vale, entrenched (as yt were) on every side,
with great hills, whose heighte and hugenes defendes the violence of
hurtefull wyndes, and assistes the natural goodness of the soil, with the
moisture of diverse streams, droppinge out of the bellies of diverse rocks,
norrished in thintralles of the said mountes: in this provincial paradise
then, and not far from the said town, is a caftell, whereof was Lord and
owner, a noble gentleman of the country, who, in the entrey of his storyshynge
time, married a young gentlewoma^, of equal honor and heighte of estate to
himself, who for her part had a grace to govern ye hoatt time of her youth,
with such modesty, that her honest conueyghe and integretie of life, seamed
to deserve no less then the virtue of Lucresia, according to thistorians, or
chaste abstinence of Penelope, by the fictions of the Poets. But whether, the
secrett hypocrasie of her infected mind, cold no longer conceile, or refrain
to event the fruits of such villainy, or whether age had abated the former
force of her husband, drayning his synews and veins of their ancient
moisture with conversion of his sapp of strenghte, into withered humors of
debilitie, or participating (paradue^ture, with the desyer and dispocicion of
such, as delight in the taste of inordynat pleasure, with often change of
dyot: having alredie passed the vttermoste of fyftie years, of a chaste and
virtuous young lady, became an old strompet, without honesty or shame, and
whose delicate youth gave more arguments and effect of stayed life, then her
old age hable to mortefye or keep under the prouacions, propre only to the
follye of unbridled youth, to whom alone is due the title of found affection,
with acts of small discrecio^. And as the french adage aduowcheth, that of a
young saint proceeds an old SATAN, and a timely hermitt, makes a tyra^nous
devil, so this diabolical Lady, supplienge ye years of her youth with loyalty
toward her husband, necessary prayer and inuocacion to God, with due respect
to the order and guide of her house, was seen to make a conversion of this
virtues, into a desyer, and effect of no less detestacion, then the offense of
CAYN, or other morderer, for that without respect to the number of her
children, or view of hoarie hairs, with other arguments of age, she began to
practice pollecies in love, wishinge in her husband a continuance of that,
which nature can not give twyse to any man, and that, whereof, she seamed not
half so desyerus in the veraie heat of the flame which kindles the sensual
appetitt, making us sometime excede the order of reason in performinge the
sommonce of sensuality, wherein feeling a want in her husband to satisfye
her filthy thirst and weary alredie with his cold compfort in bed, entered
into devise to furnishe her lack that way, whereby (as yt chanced) she
wroughte the webb of destruction to her self, with continual infamy to her
house for ever, which be the ordinary fruits of this beastelie pleasure,
breeding the tempest under a masque or counterfaite veil of calm seas, and
then, to drenche the passingers, when they are most persuaded of assurance:
and who will not confess (by this authorytie, both familiar and true) but love
is an undoubted rage and fury, seeing he forces and gives fire to that,
which ought to quench and conquerr the flame kindled first by his
suggestion.

This gentleman of the castle of CHABRYE, hadd for one of his next neighbors,
a doctor of the law called MESSIEVR Tolonyo, whom (for the creditt of his
learning) he used as a chief companion, by which means also, he had the
favor of familiar conference with his wife, without suspicion, not refusing
diverse times, in the absence of the knighte, to enter the bed chamber, and
consulte with her upon her pillowe, wherein, he exacted upon the honest
liberty given him by the goodman, for that one day (during his absence, the
aduocatt, under cooler to council the Lady in certain affairs touching the
commodity of her husband, came to her beddsyde, where he beheld her in other
sort, then he is wont to vysytt the cases of law for her husband, neither
hadd age so altered her complexion, but there appeared folly in all parts of
her face, with other intisinge glees, shrouded under the lyddes of her
allurynge eyes, which with his liberty of free access, and her contentement
to admit his compaine, forced the rather an affection in the proccurer, in
whom also as she noted certain dextereties no less hable, to perform the
buysynes of the bed, then to follow the process of law, so she did not
only allow his amarus glau^ces, with interest of equal glee on her part, but
also, as one (wholly deuested of thattyre of shame) made no conscience to
discover that part of the body, which nature has forbidden to be seen of
any, and all women of honest part, ought to keep from the sight and
knowleadge of man, which she accompained also with such lasciuius regardes of
wanton countenance, that the dymmest eyes that be in love, might easelie
discern the pathe of her intent, and judge with what feathers her arrows would
slye, wherein also TOLONYO, no less experienced then the best, forgot not to
feed the humor of her meaning, with special terms of reproach against the
weakness of tholde man, condemnynge him, as most unworthy to enjoy the
benefytt of her beauty, and much less to taste, in any sort, of the
pleasure or delicatt proporcion of this Alcyne, who to further the forwardnes
of her doctor, added thi^s terms of complaint to the words of his former
reproach how rightly may she tryumphe with treble felicity The Lady
w^^the her procurer under a complaint against the vveakne in her husband.
in this world, who delytinge to embrace her husband, participateth
indiffrentlie with the solace of outward joy, and pleasure of secrett
contentement, the remembrance of whose happy state alas, yeldes me double
cause of exclamacion against the debilitie of my aged knight, both, for that
his weakness denies force to furnyshe the sportes of the bed, and I in the
heat of desyer, to wyshe, and not find, the chiefeste pillor of my
consolacion: if I hadd not earste Sipped of the cupp of sugared delight, the
desyer had dekaied, because I hadd no taste of the pleasure, where the view of
former solace, increases my present thirst, and can not be satysfyed, or if
nature cold broache an other vessel of strength in my wythered husband, or
restore a fresh heat to his dekaied parts, my loathesome life would resume
eftensones cause of perfect contentement, and I in the mean wile, should do
wrong to accuse his present weakness, what is my passion think you Seigneur
Tolonio, prouyng perforce the want of courage in my husband, with the extreme
desyer in my self? he has no other care then too momble his morning prayers,
and Pater noster in the night, whilst I (poor soul) half starued, attend a
second froste or cold compfort in him, which rather mortefyeth my desyer,
then satisfyeth in any sort, the vehemencye of mine appetytt, and if sometime
I seek to force a mocion in him, with endeavor to give life to his dead
sprites, I am answered with hollow groans, and excuses of age, that alas my
thirst is rather increased, then desyer satisfied, and I forced to feed of
such dry banquettes with no less grudge and greeff of mind, then I should
take singler pleasure in the company of one worthy of me, and hable to
furnyshe at full thappointement due in marriage, all which the doctor was no
less gladd to hear, then desyerus to know the intent of the discourse,
which he pursewed in iestinge sort, saying, I am content madame, you make A
trial in this sort of my loyalty toward you and your house, albeit, I am so
persuaded of the courage of your husband, yt, notwtstanding any impediment by
age, he is sufficiently hable to dispatch ye affairs of the most likelye and
lusty gentlewoman in your train, such (says she) as know nothing but by
oponion and imagination, do commonly judge at pleasure upon matters of
importance, where they that have felt the effects, and made an experience of
every point, may resolve according to a troth, wherein your ignorance
acquites you for this time of imputacio^ touching the loftines of my husband,
who^ as you at unawares acco^pte a cha^pyon of such courage, yt there is no
harness, which he is not hable to pearce, so the long prooff I have had of
his worthiness, may warraunte you the contrary of such conceits, commending
unto you withal the compassion of my distress, with desyer to procure some
spedie mean of delyuerye, or release from this loathsome torment, wherewith
master aduocat began to excuse him of any intent to increase her grief, what
construction so ever she made of his former words, protestyng wythal, that the
offer of death should be more acceptable unto him, then the simple remembrance
to do her the least evil in the world, and if she sorowed in the prooffe of
a badd husband, his grief was no less in the veraye view of her languishynge
state, that I wish (madame says he) that my endeavor might discharge you of
pain, or the spoil of my life, and all that I have of the world, confirm
your quiet according to the consent of your own mind, then should you see,
whether your Tolonyo would put any difference between pleasant promises,
which every man can make, and assured effect which few men perform, with
this further experience (if it please you to employe me) to excede every one of
your domestical train in yeldyng to the sommonce of your commandment,
albeit it importe the sacrifice of my life or dissolutio^ of honor, both which
I acco^pte happily preferred, if they end in the pursewte of your service,
wherewith he seized upon one of her delicate hands, which he forgot not to
honor with the often printe of his mouth, in sundry sorts of kysses, which as
they argued thuttermost of his further intent, so she furthered an expedicion
of thindifferent desyers of them both, in grasping his hand, with no less
affection the^ he did amarus homage to al her tender parts, with this short
question in smiling order: if the goodness of your fortune, Seigneur Tolonio,
and the synister guide of my destines, accompanied with the mocion of love,
would give you as much power over me, as you seame desierous to enjoy my
favor, how would you account of such preferment, or what judgment would
you set of her liberal offer, who neither respectyng life, nor regard to
honor, is here to leave you her heart in gage, and her body to the use of your
pleasure: Ah madame, says this amarous Cyuilyan, how my unworthiness makes me
despair, ever to cooll the fruit of so great a gain, and the fear I feel to
crave that I desyer most, yeldes me no less doubtefull of theffect of your
offer, albeit on the other part, the honor and felicitye I ymagin in the
preferment, has pricked me alredye so full of courage, that the world has
nothing of such hardness, which I dare not attempt, nor any thing of so
great impossibilitye, which will not appear easy in the pursuete, so that
my travel may receive his hyer at the hands of your bountye: pardon me I
beseech you, in discoueryng that, which almost I kept secret from mine own
heart, and if my rashenes have offended you, it may like you to do justice
upon your self, whose authority (with the force of extreme passion) has
forced me to a lauishenes in the thing, which I durst not determyne, and
much less seek to set abroche in deed. Here the shameless Lady told him his
last request had prevented her long meaning, for (says she) you have hit the
mark, whereat I thought to shoot, wherein as I am contented to imparte
credit to your words, with persuacio^ of sufficient assurau^ce in your
fidelitye, so I pray you, embrace mine offer of semblable curtesye, with
addicio^ that your desyer to enjoy me, is nothing in respect of the firm
opinion I have to be so wholly yours, as your self shall devise, whereof I am
hear to seal tharticles of assurance i^ such sort as you think good,
whereupon I think no sorts of kysses or follyes in love were forgotten, no
kind of crampe, nor pinchyng by the little finger, nor his hand laid softelye
in her delicate dugge, and she again, with her arms about his neck to yield
tribut to his curtesye, was not unmindful (I am sewer) to communicate (in
this place) the circumstance of her long love, and how often she had been at
point to make declaration of her zeal, with the causes of restraint, till that
hour, which if she blessed according to the greatness of her felicity, he
thought it a duty, to honor with treble thank sgeuynge, performing there,
their first earnest of their unhappy pleasure, to thindifferent contentement
of both thadulterous, who there gave order for the conueighe of the rest of
their licencious sequel.

Here besides a consommacion and effect of detestable whordom, wherein the one
with impudency, obteineth a gloot of her insatiable lust, and the other,
unhappily yeldes to th^nbridled will of a deuelishe woman, yet is the
foundacio^ laid between the ij. wretches to increase their offense with an
act of greater sin, for, besides the vice of contaminacion of an other man's
bed, the wicked doctor aggreed to a mortal conspiracy and treason against
him, who was neither doutful of his honestye, nor suspicious of his faith, and
whose lyberallitye deserved a return of more credit, then to weaue the webb
of his destruction, for that his chiefest mean of sustentation grew by the
fees and other assistance of the gentleman: Joseph the Hebrew abstained from
like act, although he was assailed with semblable importunities in the ho^use
of the prince of Egypt, desyeryng rather to prove thuttermuste rigor of him,
who thought him self offended, then to sin haynously in the syghte of the
great god, from whose eyes no secrett is conceiled, which in the end he does
not discloase, with no less justice in punishing the fault, then he has used
long patience in tolleracion of the wickedness: Let every man behold here, an

bolstered with a dissembled show of a certain vain knowledge and skill, to
discern the good from the evil, and try the difference of the just from the
unjust, do study altogether the peruercion of justice, to seduce all good
order and honesty, and abuse (under coolour of honest faith) the simplicity of
the good sort, whereof, how many examples of iniquity do we see now a days
in diverse our professors of learning, whose vanity procures so many
diuorcementes between the man and wife, and yet they affirm (for the most part)
ye such acts are not tolerable, neither by thordinance of God, institution of
men, nor any authority in the Cyuily^n skoole, besides, how many are to be
seen, who puffed up with a little smatteringe skill in either of the laws, which
rather settes abroache the humor of their vanity, then co^firmes them in good
order or integrity of judgment or living, do trade only in corrupting the
good and sound parts, of every one, indusing some to sedicio^, other to
theft, periurye, and false witness bearing, others to haba^don their country
and parents, with the society and felowshipp of all their friends, and yet,
who has a better grace then they, in preferryng an absolute puritye of life, a
fear of the laws, obedience to their sovereigns, reverence to their
parents, and respect to the league of loyal frindship, yea, our unhappy
world, or rather the malice of our cursed time, has sturred up amongst us
such store of skillful clerks, or rather dyuinyng devils, who bolking out a
false philosophy, have (God amend it) infected the whole world with the air
of their corrupcion, and not satisfied in thabuse of the mortal wretches, and
seducyng the fragilitye of man, with a flattering allurement of sensualitye,
and pleasures of the flesh, begin by little and little to dress war against
God, with opinion to conquer that invincible power and first cause, who
laughing (for a time) at their follyes, will (no doubt) make the^ feel in ye
end, (with the due punishment and smart of their fond ymaginacions) that neither
man, nor his vain knowledge, is of any force against him, from whose troane
we receive thinspiracio^, and breath of all goodness, virtue, and wisdom,

unseen of every one, and their doings known to no man, by which means they
were neither taken, and much less douted for any such offense, neither would
any have entered into suspicion either against the Lady, or her proccurer
Tolonio, considering both their former credit, with thinnocent now dead, and
also their present sleighte in coollorynge their late detestable traison, for
the dead knight was no sooner discovered, by certain passengers that way by

cries, sometime wrynging her hands, with a dollorous regard to his dead
body, kissyng every part of his senceles ghost, and preferryng sometime a
soddaine scilence, forced (as it were) by her passion of secret sorrow, retired

desolation am I brought unto by thy wyckednes? how many flooddes of tears
will never cease hensfurth to gushe and distill upon the tomb of him, whom
thou haste trayterouslye slain, what toarches, what incense, what sacrifice,

accuse thy villenie; and witness my loyal heart in honorynge the shadow of him
that is dead, by sever punishment of such, as committed the morder, Ah dear

been acquainted with thy bountye, thou had not tasted of their cruelty, or
if they had had but half the experience of thy curteyse inclinacion, as thou
wast entierlye beloved of all such as knew the perfectly, they had sewerlye

the tears of a desolate wydow) that he that gave the mortal blow, have never

of revenge of thaffliction of such as I am? Oh children, why stay you your
tears in the misery of your mother, and loss of so good a father, who shall
from hensfurth favor your tender years with further sustentation, or defend the

much less argue against the determinacion of the heavens, neither is there
virtue in tears or complaints to raise up him that sleeps in his fatal
mowlde, the best is to expose fruits of patience, and be thankful to his
goodness, who by the example of this affliction, warns you and all the world
of his royal power over all estates, with a ready endeavor in your self, to
manifest your duty to him that is dead, in the persecution of such as shall be
found guiltye in the cause of your present heaviness, neither let the view of
his mangled carcass restore you to increase of dollor, seeing that, as the
earth chalengeth his boanes, as first framed out of her bellye and intralls,
so I wish you to give order for his buryall in sort appertayning to his

great sorrow of his subjects, who also grieved in equal sort on the behalf
of their Lady, who, showing thuttermost of her connyng in crafty paintynge,
in the funeral hour, could not be holden from falling into the grave,
which she watered on every side with the tears of her eyes, crauynge that she
might make a sepulcher in her own breast, to shryne the body of her husband,
or at least that it might be lawful to boorne his boanes, to the end she
might consume by peacemeale in drinking the ashes, as Ariomesia did the
skorched relics and cendres of her dear Mansoll: Oh deceit, and deuelish
hypocrisye of a woman? What enchauntement so strongelye made, of whom thy
subteltie can not undo the charm? What armor of such force, that is not
found to weak to resist the strength of thy malice? What medecin of such
virtue, which can prevail above thy infection? What, train? What traison?
What mischief or morderynge cruelty is hable to compare with the villenie of
a woman, unhappily deuested of thattire of reason and virtue, which for the
most part, are or ought to be most familiar with that sect? wherein
appears an evident prooffe of the venomous pollecie in a woman, if the
outward aparance of an extreme sorrow, (the heart reioysinge wc treble
co^tenteme^t within) do not declare her deceitful disposicio^? what hypocrisy
is greater, the^ to suborne al sorts of tears in the eyes, with every other
sign of counterfeyte dule in the face, when the ynner parts, laughyng at
such fained shows, are in the myddest of their banquet for pleasure? what
offense is it to plage them in earnest, who seek to blaire the eyes of all the
worlds, with charms of painted substance? or rather, why should they be
suffered to live, whose villainous lives and doings, were hable to deface the
glory of the whole feminyne sect, if the virtue of so many chaste Ladies were
not of force to answer the combat of all synister reproach, and conquer the
infamous chalengers of their renown.

But now the funerals performed to the dead Lord of Chabrye, the Lady,
albeit she dismissed by little and little the greatness of her dollor, yet she
ceased not her diligence in the search of the morderer, nor forgot to
promise large hyer to such as could bring her the ministers of the fact,
there was public informacion, and secrett inquirye, with every point and
circumstance so Syfted to the quick, that there lackte nothing but the
confession of him that was dead, which was impossible to be had, or the
testimonys of the bloddie parties, which were the commissioners appointed to
enquire of the morder, whose hands smelled of the blood of the dead innocent,
whereupon the matter was hushed for a time, in which, TOLONIO was not idle to
ransicke every secret corner in the house, not forgetting (I think) to visytt
the treasore he chiefly affected, and for a simple pleasure of the which, he
had been so prodigal of his conscience, who, yet not satisfied with the
sacrifyze of innocent life, stirred up desyer of greater sin: for this
tyrannouse wyddow, had iiij. sons, whereof as ij. of them were continuallye
in the house, so the eldest, Ialowse (not without cause) of the famyliaritye
between his mother and her doctor, whose haunte he judged to excede the
compass of his commission, and lymittes of honor, cold not so conceile nor
disgeste the conceit of that, which persuaded a stain of infamye in the
forheade or forefronte of his house, but that he thought to belong to his
duty, to ymparte unto her ye cause of his suspicion, with perswacion (in
humble sort) to be indiffrently careful to keep her former glory of virtuous
life, and curious to defend the remeindor of her years from worthy crime, or
spot of foul ymputacion, wherein thincrease of amarus glee between the aduocat
and her, procured a more expedicio^ then he thought, so that having, one day,

that a king should be disobeyed of his subjects, it is no less necessary in
mine opynion that the prince avoyde oppression of his people by power, for that
a great falte in the one is none offense at all by reason of his authority,
and the other sometime is exacted without just cause of blame, but if it be a
virtue in the majesty royal to be indiffrent between the force of his power,
given him by god, and the compleintes of right in his vassalls, why should it
be an offense, that the master or magistrate be put in remembrance, or made
tunderstande the points wherein he offends, seeing, he has no greater
reason to yield justice to such as deserve punishmente, then bound in doble
sort to a wonderful care of integretie in living, in himself so as, his
authority and effects of upright co^uersacio^, may serve, (as a line) to lead
the meaner sort (serving under his awe) to be in love wc his virtues and

(good Madame) were it not the remorse of an equal respect to your reputacion,
and honor to al our house, and that my conscience hereafter would accuse me of
want of courage and care to make good the virtuous renown of my dead father, I
should hardely be forced to the terms of my present intent, nor my being in
this place give you such cause of amaze and doubt of my meaning: for the
duty, which nature binds me to owe to ye place you hold on my behalf, and
the law of obedience given by god, to all children toward such as made
theyme the members of this world, makes me as often cloase my mouth against
the discovery of the long grudge of my mind, as I have great reason to
ympart the cause to your ladishipp, who is tooched more near then any other,
that I would too god the thing, whereof my mind has given a judgment of

Albeit as the passions of the mind be free, and the sprite of man (how so

herafter you become as careless of the honor of your children, as heretofore

passioned between doubt and fear, for that your present collar, Quarrelyngwith
al offers of defense on my side, seameth also curious, to admit any creditt at
all in what so ever I shall prefer to approve my guilteles life: for if yt be
a virtue to be credulus in every reapport, you have reason to continue your
grudge, or if the view of your own eye, had brought you to the sight of
that, wherein you presume a trothe but by ymagination, you were suffycientlye
absolved, if you hadd alredie performed the end of your mortal enterprise,
but where your eyes argue against you, (as partakers at no time of the

the course of my youth, (when you were under the yoke and years of discrecion)
accuse the wrong you do to the virtue of mine age, whose hoarie hairs cry
out of your present cruelty. Alas what is he that dare undertake the defense
of this desolate widow, if mine own children seek to set abroache my

assurance in mine honesty, when the fruts, congealed of the substance of my

loyalty, or good opynion, is in any sort of strangers, when the blood and
blossoms of our own intralls enter into conspiracy against us? oh miserable
condition, and unhappy sect of ours, subject most (as yt seameth) to
strange wretchedness, when we account our selves paste the fear and malice
of fortune, who now I see, begins her troblesome war, when we reappose
most felicity and assurance in rest? yt is now alas that I find an

with the malice of all those myschieues, although I only am oppressed with a
present villanye, whereof I never thought, and much less performed any
effect? how long alas, (my son) have you joined in opynion with that fond
sect, whose rashenes in judgment has made theme oftentimes repent the
sentence of their folly? since when have you been so lightly persuaded, of the
reputacion, constancy, and virtue of dames of honor? do you measure their
dispocicion, by the vanity in your self, and villainy of such as creditt only
thinstinct of their malicius brain: no no, yt is not thindeuor of ladies of my
regard, to practice in sensuality, nor study in the vain delites of the
flesh, and for my part, me thinks discrecion should persuade you, that the
time, and number of my years are not convenient to the follies, whereof I
felt no mocion, in the veraye flame and burninge summer of my youth: you
grieve with the famyliaritie between Tolonyo and me, but chieflye, because we
use conference now and then in my chamber: do not you know yt is he, by whose
counsel are guyded the whole affairs of the house? or do you see his liberty
enlarged since the death of your father, in whose time he practiced in sort
as he does now, and yet was he never Ieleouse of his access hither at any
hour: had he not eyes to discern as far of as you: and his ears wear as
open to al reapportes as yours? albeyt he used discrecion in judgment? neither
cold his heart (I am sewer) disgeste half the villenie you have alleged, if
his sormise hadd been confirmed with a trothe: But here alas appear the points
of my wretchedness, to fall into the danger of suspicion with him, in whom I
have reaposed ye quiet of my old years, and for thincrease of whose wealth and
patrymonie, I am in contynuall traueile both of mind and body: wherein as
the poor Tolonyo (no less unfortunate then I, for that your grudge seameth
most heinous on his behalf) has equal care to advance you by his advise
and trauelle, So, besides your abuse to me, whom God and nature binds you to
honor with all duty, you do doble wrong to his faith and zeleus intent
toward you, in retornynge his honest care with threats of no less
mortality, the^ shameful and cruel death, which if yt come in question by
your rashenes, what dowte bring you of his honestye, where now his name is of
credytt with the best of the contreye? and for his part, if you give him the
least ynkling in the world of your displeasure, I warrante you his presence
shall no more offend you in the house nor elsewhere, and then shall you know,
whether the favor he fyndes at my hands ymportes a meaning for your proffit,
or to satisfye the pleasure of my vile and aged flesh, besides, the order of
your affairs, both at hoame and in the senatt, will try the diffrence
between the commodity of his presence, and hyndrance that is sewer too happen

to be charged with the note of incontynencie, which I proteste affore God,
with stretched hands and heart to the heavens, to have in no less contempt,
for the vileness of the sin, then I see the wrongefull conceyte of such a
villenie does troble you, which she forgatt no too accompanye, with all
sorts of syghes and signs of dollour, entrermedled with such regardes of
dyssembled pity in all parts of her face, that albeyt, he was paste all dowte
touching the trothe of his own conceyte, yet the tears of his deceytefull
mother, moved him to admit her excuses, with such compassion of her sorrow,
that he seamed also to pass the panges of her present passion, with
protestacion, under terms of great humility, that he grieved no less in
that he had said, then she hadd great reason, to complain of the wrong he
hadd done to the renown of her virtue, albeyt says he (with a countenance
of repentance) if you measure the force of my affection, with the cause of my
late plains, your discrecion, I hope will conster my words according to the
honest intent of my heart, with excuse to my rashenes, which you shall see
hereafter so mortefyed in me, that I will neither be so hastye to accuse, nor
suspect without better advise, for the which she seamed thankful unto him,
with a present appeasement from Anger, attendyng the offer of opportunity, when
she might prefer her son to a part in the tragedye which her wickedness
had alredye begone upon his late father: for she was doutefull still of the
youngeman, and gave less faith to his words, wherein certeinely appears an
experience of an ordinary custume in the wicked, who payseth thinfydelitie of
others, in the balance of their own injustice, and want of faith, for the
tyrant dowteth to whose creditt to comitt the sauetie of himself, because his
cruelty is hated of all men, neither does he good to any, if not for the
respect of profit, or to perform some malicius attempt, wherein as they
consider thaffexcions of their people, by the passions in theimselues, so in
passing. their own life in continual fear, they procure like terror to
such as be conversant with them, making the disquiett of others equal to
the misery of theimselues, like as this new Megera or tyrannouse monster of
our time, who, no more satiffied with the blood of her husband, then glutted
or cloyed with ye continual pleasures in whoredom with her detestable Tolonyo,
determined to rydde the world of her innocent son, to thend their villainous
trade might pass with more assurance, and less cause of fear or suspicion
of any: for thexecutio^ whereof, her wickedness devised this spedy and necessary
mean: There was within the castle, a high gallery, borded underfoot with
certain plankes fastened to rotten planchers, where as ye young gentleman used
his dailye recreacion in walkinge, by reason of the delitefull air, and
pleasant prospect upon diverse feldes and gardyns, so the Tygresse his mother
reserved that place, as a most chief and mortal minister in the death of her
son, for she and her pernicius proccurer one euenyng, knocked out of either
end of diverse of the plankes, the nails that kept theime cloase to the
plancher, in such sort, that the next, that happened too make his walk
there, should have no leisure to discover the traison, and much less live, to
bring reapport of the hardness of the rocks growing in the diches, under the
said gallerie, which chanced vnhappelie to the son of this she wolffe, who
no more happy in a mother, then his father fortunate in a wife, renewed the
next day his accustumed walks in the valte, where he had not spent three or
four tornes, but his destynie brought him to tread upon the fatal bourd es,
who having no hold nor stay to rest upon, disioyned theimselues with the
wayght of thinfortunat gentleman, who falling soddeinly upon the rocks with
his head forward, was bruised to pieces, being dead Her eldest son slain by

in deed, almost so sone as he felt thapprehencion of death, Who would have
judged such trayso in a mother to work such an end to her son or noted such
wate of pity in any of ye sect, as to so the seeds sprung in her own
flanks, deformed and he wed in pieces upon the edge of sharppe and piked
stoanes: what mistortune to the son, and villainy in a mother: saying the
title of a son ought to be so dear, and name of a mother, is so delicate and
of such virtue, that no heart, of what metal soever it be made, is not
mollefyed and does homage to that dignity, yea every one holds his blodde
so dear, that, the beasts theimselues, by a prouocacion of nature, (although
other ways insensible) have such affectioned regard to their fawnes, that
they fear not to contend against every peril of death, to defend their
youngons from danger, what greater felicity has man, traveling in the stormy
sea of this world, then to see (as it were) a regeneracion of himself, in his
children, with a plentiful and gladsome increase of his seed, for which cause
chiefly, god ordained the holy institucion of marriage, not respecting
altogether, the mortefyeng of the ticklyshe instinctes of our declayning
flesh, but rather of regard, as thappostel affirms, to keep the society of
man in order, making it appear'e pure and aeceptable to the great monarke, and
syrst founder of so noble a work. But, to return now to our history, this
ympp of thinfernall lake, and hellish Lady, being already dispoyled of all
affection and duty required in a woman toward her husband, detested also
every point of charity and zeal, which nature challenged in her to the fruit
flowered within the tender parts of her intralls, whose fall and miserable
death, as you see, filled ymediatlie every corner of the castle with
desolacion and tears, some weping in the want of their brother, other
complained the lack and misfortune of there kynsman, the view of whose
dysmembred body, sturred up also a fresh sorrow on the behalf of their late
Lord, but all their dollor was nothing to the howlinge and cries of the
detestable mordress, who entermedled her greffe, with such arguments of
desperacion, that her sorrow seamed sufficient to make the earth tremble, and
move the heavens to tears, neither seamed she to make other account of the
world, then a place of most loathsome abode, by which masqued semblance of
outward heaviness, she covered an inward joy at her heart, and by this pollecie
of painted dule, she blaired the eyes of the simple multitude, who, after ye
retire of the heat of their lamemtable storms, consulted upon the buyrial,
with general consent in the end, that thinnocent striplinge should be laiede
in the tomb of his unfortunate father, to thend, he might participat with him
in the fatal pit, as he was equal to him touching the malice of his mother.

And now as this bloddie Lady, had in this sort, discharged (as she thought)
every doubt and fear hereafter, chiefly for that she stood no more in awe of
any Censor or spy to keep a calendar of her faltes, whereby she used less care
in the conueigh of her beastly traffic with her viperus aduocat: So not
wythstanding her second son, grudginge still in the death of his brother,
and some what doubtful of the cause, began to be Ieleouse in the points of his

in heart, cold not also digest the view of dishonor, specially in the highest
degree of his house and affynitie, whereof he gave declaracion in his stern

words argued the disdain in his heart, using, vnhappelie, the like regardes
and terms to his mother, who, not liking to have any tutor, to note or
control her villainy and hardened with all in thexecution of flesh and life,
judged it no offense to embrue her hands with the blod of this innocente, and

rewarding their howndes, with the pawnche and intrals of certain chasses they
had killed, their unfortunate master, reapposed himself upon the edge of a
steape and high hill, whose descent ymported a perilous regard, by the deep
and hollow vaulte in the valleye, replenished on every side with sharppe and
hideous rocks: here, as he accounted himself most sewer, and furthest from

What difference may a man set between the desolacion of his house, and myserie
of the succession of Atreus the Greek, whose children were cruelly cut in
pieces, the wife of one of them suruiuing, a noted woman of all the world for
incestious life, becomes in the end the mordresse of her husband, by
thassistance of thadulteror and defyler of their marriage bed, and she with her
rybaud oppressed at last with vengance equal to their offense by the hands of
her own son, what pytie is it to see an experience of such examples amongst
christians, and in this age, yea in the place and contry, where the regard of
parents toward their children is such, that they make no conscience to
hazard their own lives, to defend the health of such as nature has given
them for succession: where this execrable ympp of infernal procreacio^, borne
for the skourge and plage of her posterity, respecting more to conceile and
aggrauat her wickedness, then careful any way, to repent her sins, delited (as
it seamed) to sprinkle the earth with innocent blod, which cried vengance both

funerals of her younger son, seeing yt al her servants kept eye and watch upon
her, with suspicio^ of her vicious dealing, ymparted ye whole to the galla^d her
minio^, who consulted and concluded ymedyatly the end of their pleasures and
exercises of blodd togeger, which was to marye one an other, wherein albeit
appeared a diffycultye, for that TOLONYO, had already a wife, no less wise,
fair, and virtuous, then he cruel, spiteful, and vicious, yet it seamed not
ympossible, for that the wicked man accompteth a facilytie in every thing,
which he estemeth either reasonable or lawful: He determined at what price
soever it were, to make her play a fourth part in the former tragedy of the
father and his ii. sons, ympartinge his bloddie resolucion to his beastlye

it is to be thought, the couetus doctor, did not devise, with intent to
perform, for the respect altogether of love or frendshipp, he bare to her,
whom he goes now abowte to marye, for he considered, that men, for the most
part, embrase traitors, to make their proffyt of their inventions and
subtelties, which when they have wrested from them, either the traitors be
punished by death, or at least, so disdained, that their miserye in lyuinge,
shows thundowted difference between virtue and vice, disposicion of an
infidel, or one that este^eth not his faith, and he that is careful to keep
his conscience clear from such spott: So Tolonyo not ignorant of ye large
revenue, and great sums of money of the lady of CHABRYE, with store of
other welthe about the castle, accounted it a commodity, to exchange the
life of his wife, for the fylthie use of so great riches, meaning
notwythstanding, to enjoy the spoils of so plentiful a pray, and after to
send her packinge, and make her pass by the pathe of so many morders
committed both by the one and the other. Oh unbridled covetousness and execrable
desyer of dishonest gain, how haste thou blaired the eyes and understanding
of men now a days, hardening their hearts against the dread of god, and fear
of his laws? what mischief has overwhelmed us by thy means, seeing the
father is Ielowse of the faith of his son, the wife doubtful of her
husband, the neighbor fearyng ambushes of treason in his next companion, and
the prince often times in danger of his sauetye, being besett on every side
with the guard and ministers of money, which has such force over the
fragilitie of men that some time the servant conspireth against his Lord, to
enriche himself with the spoils of his master, the son grudgeth in the long
life of his father, because he kepes him from thuse of his possession. And some
we see procures the death of him, for whose life and preservation of health, he
ought to be in continual prayer, neither does the malice of that wickedness
rest altogether in the hearts of the temporal, but, there be, also of the
sacred sort infected with ye poison of that ^enemous worm, who the more she
grows in strength and force, the greater miserye do we feel, that unhappy
is that world which participateth with so hurtefull an air, wherein if this
abominable desyer of gain, have power to disolue that, wherein God has
forbidden a separacion by man, and nature bound us to an equal care and zeal,
as to our selves, I see not what way we may take, to find assurance of faith
and loyaltye, nor under what cly^nat may be found any, which imitate the
simplicity of our ancestors seeing the malice of our age, excedeth (in that
respect chiefelye) all corruption that ever has been noted amongst the most
infydelles, and cruel barbaryans, that either live now, or have been in any
time before. And so to our morderinge Tolonyo, who buildyng a thousand castles
in the air upon the complott made for the dispatche of his wife, was not hable
to resolve upon any certain mean touching thexecution, for, seaminge (as
they say) to hold the swyne by the ear, he was loath to let her go, and
doubtefull which way to keep her, without danger to himself; sometime he was
of opinion to work the fatal mean by poison, wherein appeared absolute
peril, for that himself was ignorant in bruinge the confection, and the
assistaunce of an appoticarie was denied, in that he dreaded a discouerye in
impartinge the misterye to a stranger: he practiced with him, who (as you have
hard) served his torn in the slaughter of the father and sons, wherein,
albeit he was deceived, and the destynie of his wife rather deferred, then her
punishment forgiven, yet the day of her fatal date seamed to approach, for
that, as he half dispaired in the fidelity of his former executioner touching
this third attempt of blood, wherein also appeared a difficulty in the act,

the soddain fall of a cold rewme, with superfluitye of fleame that had forced
this mortal suffocacion in his wife, which was easelye believed of his men,

with the noise of the cry, the aged man her father, who the same night sopped
with his daughter, and left her in as good estate, as she was ever before, in
whom the consent of the destynies of Tolonyo, and the justice of the highest,
seamed of indifferent operacion in the view of his tragedy, for that
notwithstanding his tears and sorrow, he gave diligent regard to the face
and throat of his daughter, whereof the one was swelled and pooffed up with
black blood, and in the other appeared a circle or print of ye thing that
wrought theffect of her death, wheruppon followed a secret judgment in
himself, that she was distressed by mortal violence, and the deflurion which
smothered and stopped the conduites of her breath, were the hands of her
husband, or some other by his appointement, wherein, notwithstanding, he was
so constant in dissimulynge his opynion for the present, that he forbear, as
then, to give any show of his grudge, attendyng a more fytt time and
oportunitye for the revenge of so great a villenie, and that to the terror
and example of all ages, touching such heinous abuses to their honest wives,
whereupon willing his son in law to consider of the obsequies according to
the meritt of both their houses, he said he would go procure the company of

passed the torments of mortal affliction upon the cross, to give life to
them that were dead in sin, and blood sealed the articles of reconcilement

in France in that behalf, whereof she was made to understand by some secret
spy, who also warned her of the diligent inquisicion and means that were made

either assurance or sauetye at Pogetto, went to Ieyues with one man only called
Iacques Pallyero, who, some what Jealous of the coming away of his mystres,
or rather fearinge in the end, to be partaker of the punishment of her wicked
life, made no conscience, one day, as she was in her deuocions in the church,
to robb her of every part and parcel of her money and Jewels, with other
necessaryes, saving such as she ware about her, which was such a corsaye of
secret and frettynge grief for the time, that she was at point to admit
thoffer of despair, albeit being alredie entered into repentance, and iudginge
that misfortune of little or no value in respect of thinfinit abuses of her
former time, gave God thanks for his visitation, and entering into devise for
means to support the residue of her years addressed her to an ancient
wydowe, to whom as she accomptes her present necessitye, proceeding of the
villainy of her man, without any mention (I am sewer) of her detestable trade
passed, or cause of her present being there, so she found such favor in this
matrone, that in respect of her show of honest behavior, and grauitye,
arguinge her descent from nobilitee, she committed unto her the government and
bringynge up of her daughters, in which trade, she ended veraye porelye,
albeit with more honor then she deserved, her unhappy days: Here you see the
misery of this wretch, who erst has commanded over a howshould of
servants, and gentlewomen at her beck, is now brought to live under the awe
of one inferior to her house and calling, and who, passing her youth with all
pompp and delicat norriture, and now drawinge to the end of her years, is
forced to an experience of continual exile: subject to the will and pleasure of
an other, and pressed (as she did indeed) to dye out of her country, without
the company or compfort of any her friends to cloase her eyes, or couche her
boanes in other shryne or sepulcher, then by thappointment of strangers,
wherein, certeinelye appears rightlye the infallible judgment of God, who,
forsaken of such, as yield honor to their proper desyers, suffers theime also
to fall in such sort, that in the end they are constrained to confess their
faults, with detestatio^ of their sin, when they feel his just vengeance
powered upon them, like as it happened to those miserable or rather morderyng
lovers, whose end notwithstanding, I account very happy, seeing they were
not voyede of repentance in the last hour and moment of life: and truly he is
sufficientlye blyssed, the eyes of whose mind, in the last and fatal hour
be not dymmed with the darkness of infidelity, and obstinate desperacion,
seeing it is upon the body and souls of such that God thondereth fire of his
anger, and flame of immortal furye. Behold hear the end of thimpudent love
of these adulterers, the fruits of so detestable a tree, and the fortune of
such falsours of their promise and oaths, made in the face of the church, and
hear you may see the commodity that commonly attendes the villainy of such,
as unjustly spill the blood of their neighbor, saying that God has willed by
his divine providence, that tooth for toothe, and eye for eye, be taken from
him, who, (without the consent of the law) offends his brother, in whom
appears the liuelye image of our savior, who has also forbidden by
special inhibicion the violacion of blood by morder, and every thought and
effect of adultery and whordome, but chieflye the dishonest embracinge of the
wife of our neygbour, who once united with the body of her husband, (whereby
of ij. moyties, are made one whole and entyer heart) does abuse and dishonnor
the bond of their sacred league, if she but wish, and much more enjoy, the
company of any other in unlawful sort.

FINIS.
The argument
Amongst all the passions which nature sturreth up to disquiet the mind of
man, there is none of such tyrany, or kepes us more in awe, then the detestable
humor of covetousness, and raging appetyt of whoredom, whereof as both the one
and the other, engender fruits of semblable fury, and expose effects of equal
evil, So he is of treble commendacion, that being possessed of the first,
does rather abandon his goods, then in pursewinge the suggestion of his
insatiable desire, semes to procure willingly his own torment in this world
with assured danger to his soul in the day of general account, and
vanquishing the second, which erst had thon y awe and dominion of him, he
leaves a glorious remembrance of ymortalitie to his name, and discharges his
conscience of a heavy and yrkesome burden. But if the desire to wynn great
treasures, makes the noble mind forgetful of the regard of his honor, with
constraint to do things not worthy any way of the title of virtue, or if
(according to virgil in his second Eneydos) this gredy thirst after gold, is
of force to corrupt the hearts of mortal men, and fill them full of all
infection, it is nothing to the power of the sensual appetit, which once
taking possession of our inward parts, god knows what fruits it bringes
forth, formyng us in a frame of brutalitie, nothing inferior to thinsensible
sort, according to the Greek orator, saying that when a man gives himself
to the pleasures of the flesh, be makes exchange of thexcellencie which he
participates with thymage of god, and becomes of form and likeness to a beast
without understanding, wherein also the wise king of the Hebrews amongst his
sondrie sainges of wisdom, wills us to remember, that the lips of a whore
be sweet distillinge drops of honnye, but thoperacion excedes the bitterness
of gawle, and is more sharp then the sword that cuttes with two edges, warning
every man to shon that sugared evil as a pestilent air, for that (says he)
the man that escapes such passages, besides that his life is fre from
infynitie of dangers, leaves an honorable remembrance of his virtue to all
posterities: And albeit the great roman Captain Scipio Affricanus chief

nothing degenerating from thytalyan inclynacion touching the desire of the

wrong to her virginity, all which examples as I must confess to deserve
everlasting memory, and they that have used such virtuous abstinence,
meritorious of ymmortall commendacion, yet I can not compare their doings with
the virtue of him, who thoroughly gauled with the arowes of love, having long
courted a young and fair damesell, tasted of every passion which may, any way
pinche the heart of him that is plunged in affection, and desyeringe nothing
but the reward of love, which gives end to thamarous sorrows, after he had
spente many nights in hollow dreams, consumed the days in incerteine
ymaginacions, wept, sighed, and otherways tormented him self in the pursewt
of his mistres, when his desire was of greatest force, and his hope ready to
convert it self into despair, being sewed unto, and having power over her who
erst might have commanded him and all that was his, checked the humor of his

honor, whose example me thinks makes blushe all other which earste have been
preferred as pattornes of coutynencie, for that in ouercommyng him self, he
did not only refrain to lay hands upon her, who yielded the use of her
honesty rather by necessity, then prouocacion of affection, but also
embrasinge her rare assurance in virtue, releued her want no less
plentifully, then if she had been his sister bred in the womb wherein him self
was conceived, of such one do I meaue to discourse in the history following,
as more virtuous and worthy of praise, then either Scipio, Alexander, or
Sforce, wherein notwithstanding I refer the Judgment to such as have van
quished the force of affection by semblable virtue

LVCHYN IS LONG IN love with a simple maid, whom he woeth and cannot win by
any passion he endures, at last necessetie yeldeth her into his hands,
when he does not only refuse to abuse her body, but also takes order to
sustain her, and supply her wantes no less amply then if she had been his
sister.
THe records of antiquity and monumentes in IEYNE, making a particular
description of diverse accedentes happening to the noble house of Vynaldo,: have
left a special note of one Luchyn (being of the remeynder of that race) who
succeding his parents in patrymonie and possession, was nothing inferior in all
respects of honor and virtue, and exceded them all in liberal disposicion
and gift of bowntie, detesting the nigardlike order of the Ienoways, who
gasping more of tene then they get meat, The order of the hungrye Spanyarde.
do commonly rise from the table with an appitit, and make clean their teeth,
when they fill not their belly, like as also the hungry spanyarde, who being
at hoame can live of a little, but feding of an other man's tre^cher, his throat
seames as wide as the deuowring awstrich, and is hable to match the gredieste
flemyng and greatest epicure in Almayne.

He being thus thonly heir of his house, reauing already amongst ye massye
bags of his father, who left him the keys of his golden coffers, set a
broach ymediatly ye frank disposition of his liberal heart, and opening al ye
gates of his pallaice, denied ye repair of none, whereby he somoned in short
time a lustye train of ga^llandes and glory of youth, more apt to hunt ye
chasse of his spoil, then likely to preserve his patrymonie, whom (as one not
much ouercharged with care to keep that he had, nor covetous in desire to
augment the legaicie and leaving of his father he used as his chief and
familiar companions in the pursewte of his pleasure, I mean in the practice of
exploites of chiualrye on horseback, wrastlinge, leapinge and other exercises
of actiuitie, with a thousand chaunges of recreacions of delight, and pastimes
incidente to young gentlemen, who fyndinge the care of the world hurtful to
their young and tender inclynacion (and having wherewith to sustain their
prodigal vain, do pass the short time of their green years in the only
ymytacion of pleasure, wherein this young heir of VYVALDO, took such large
penny worthes, and was assisted with so long a time, that he seamed to lack
nothing to make him appear happy in this world, but a dispense from above to
defend him from the dangerous snares and prison of love, who albeit is
blind, and of small force, yet is he ordained to interrupte the ease of men,
with a special grudge and common hatred to thexcesse of felicity in our youth.

And because there is nothing on earth that is contynual Yt is necessary to
feel sometime a change of fortune.
ly happy, and that it is necessary to know the causes why we are of the
world, I mean to be touched, sometime with a change of our fortune; and
passion of hard disgestion, as well as we seek to taste of the delicates of
ease, and wallowe in contynual pleasure, So I think, that even as covetousness
and gredie desire is thordynarie torment and contynual bourreau that trobles
the mind of thold man, Euenso, love is an impression of disquiet, which nature
has sown in the hearts of young men, both to restrain in time the raginge
folly of youth, and (according to the order of the pinchinge frost killinge
the buddes of certain trees and flowers that appear duringe the violence of
his time) to chasten the abuse of their long pleasure, with a rebuke of no
less sharp disposicion, then almost insupportable for the tenderness of their
discretion, which love being blind of himself, seames also to (...) small
regard in ye disposition of his affairs with less discr^^^o^ in knitting
thaffectio^s of those unhappy wretches which he bringes to draw under the
yoke of his awe, whereof our age swarms with examples, which I am content to
dismiss for this time, by reason of ye superfluity of the same, and referr
you to the sequile of this Luchin, who dandled (as it were upon the lap
offollye and, served with nothing but dishes of delit and ^^^^^are, could not
bear so even a hand upon the bridle of his affections, but or he wiste he let
slipp the steddie reign of his liberty and became extremely in love with a
simple maid, whose beauty he accounted of more price, then her self or
parents noble by discente or other special assistance of fortune. And albeit
his personage and living with thestimation of other gifts which nature had
lent him above the rest, seamed sufficiently hable to make him meritorious of
favor of the best Lady of a country, yet love (having neither respect to
his race nor regarding his greatness) did close his eyes from the view of such
as were hable to answer him in equalitye of discente and virtue, and converted
his heart and affection to the contemplacion of a simple maid, whose name
albeit is not of such veneration as Camylle and Lucretia, whose high titles
only do importe a certain semblance and creditt of honesty in the person of
a public curtisan, yet her chastetie with womanly government, deserves no
less co^mendacion then the most approved of ancient time, for being the
daughter of a poor man, she grudged not with the portion of poverty, but
thought it a principal virtue to embrace the lot of her state with thankeful
contentement, and be careful to releue the hard condicon of her parents with
the honest endeavor of her hands, she made not her beautye, a looking glass
for the world, but studied to be worthy of so precious a Jewel, she would
not suffer her body to be pampred with delicacye, least her mind should be
subject to thinfection of evil, nor give any place to thalarmes of the flesh,
least the same should preuale above her resistance, and being of the age of
fyftene or sixtene years, her modesty was of no less admiracion serving, as a
lantern to light all the ladies of Ieyne, then her beauty (without a second)
hable to allure the best assured of a country, whose first view and simple
regard, brought such sudden astonishement to the lofty mind of this
Luchyn, that after he had conferred the secrett mystery, which nature had
hidden in her face, with the special Beautye.

enchaunted, and eyes as lymed with the glaunce of her looks, not hable to
wythdrawe their regardes from the contemplacion of so perfect a beauty,
which was not set out to the sale, by any artifyciall means of paintynge or
assistance of powder or other vain experience of diverse of our counterfaite
masquers now a days, neither did she seame to prefer any suborned bravery
for thaduancement Vvome^ seame masquers in painting their faces.
of so precious a dowrye, either by superfluous frizilation of the hear,
twincklinge of the eye, wrynginge the lip, or wrestinge the chyn, minsynge or
measurynge her pace, as though her joints were out of tune, or tied together
with points, or other lewd Iestures devised by the curtisan, and practiced as
a principle and chief grace at this day, by diverse of our delicatt and wanton
dames: who not waighing the due merit of so precious an orname^t, and less
worthy to wear so rare a badge of nature, do abuse the goodness of them both,
in conuertting the only gift of God into a detestable mean to agrauate sin.

And receiving thus the first somo^ce of love, whose arrows being fethered
with the wing of infection, do leave the heart wounded with a burning desire to
pursue thinstigacion of our appetit, he found himself to weak to abide any
more alarams, albeit striving a little at the first to defend his liberty,
with ye intent to answer appeal to thuttermost of his forces, he brewed the
broth of his own ^ale, and renewed ye torment of his passion in such sort, yt
there were few days in yt wherein he performed not his pale walk before the
lodging of his fair Ianiquette, whom if by any adventure his roauing eyes did
spy at ye doare, he forgatt not to salute, with no less humylitie, then if
she had been one of the greateste ladies in Ieane, courting her besides with a
low reverence and other offices of dutiful civility, in no less reverend
manner then if he had presented his service to the greatest princess of Italy
which also drive the girl into some amaze, as one not exsperienced in the
order of such amarus gretinges, and less used to be saluted by any gentleman
equal in calling or co^dicio^ to Siegneur Luchyn, whose fame as it was great
both by ye authority he bare in ye City and reputacion of his living, with
other gifts and ornaments of nature, So it drive her into doble astonishment
to conster the meaning of his new courtesy, albeit leaving ye diuinacio^ of
his intent, to a time of more leisure, she retired to the virtue of her good
norriture, for yt which she was no less meritorious, then imbrased (as you
see) for her beauty, And drawing ye blod of seamly shame into her face, which
set such a glass of natural white and red of her co^mplexion, yt her coollor
seamed to be died in the dew of ye fragra^t morning of May, and returned his
courtsie with a salutacio^ of se^blable humility, wherein he reioysed with more
co^te^tme^t of mind, then if ye Queen of Spain had yielded him favor to kiss
her hand. But what need he tickle himself to make himself laugh, or why did he
not eschew ye presence and place of his enemy, rather the^ seame so subject to
ye so^monce of his eye, to who^ love has given the gift of flattery to
deceive ye rest of ye parts, for if at ye first he had corrected ye flickering
reaporte of his eyes, his heart had been fre from desire, and he not at the
brinke of passion, and torments, and if at ye biginning, he had aba^doned ye
place, he had also dismissed the remembrance of that, which now has bound
him to pursewe beauty.
the queste of his own disquiete, neither does he other thing in visitynge
the place where she is, then throw water upon hoate ymbers, which dobleth
the heat, and forces the flame with more expedicion, for the more he beheld
her, and the less she regarded him, the greater grew his affection, giving
treble increase to his desire. And albeit she was neither fine in attire, set
out in robes of rich array, nor deckte with apparel for the more decoracion
of her natural beautye, yet appeared she no less precious in the eye of this
gallande, then if she had been trimmed for the nonste, in the same order that
the Poets feign of the brown Egypciane when she was brought to lie with the
Roman Captain Marcus Anthonius. He failed not to reiterate his haunte with
an ordinary trade to the streets of ^aniquette, resoluynge his common abode or
place of stay right over against her lodginge which increased her doubt of
that misterye, till nature that discusseth the darkness of such doubts, and
bringes the most rude creatures of the world to be capable in the arguments
of love, revealed unto her the meaning of that ridle, saying yt the roundes
and often tornes with vaylinge of bonnett which the proud pirott made before
the door of her fortress, was no other thing then the intisynge harmony of
the Syrenes, or other stale to allure or make her pliable to thappetite of
Mearemaides
his will, wherein she was the rather resolved for certeinetie, for that within
short time, passing that way, he ymagined a stay right over against her
house, Where feedinge the time for the nonste in devise with one of his
friends, gave skoape to his eyes to peruse (with continual contemplacion) the
majesty of his mistres in such sort, that one of her compagnions exercisynge
also the use of the nedle, encountered by chance she gredie regardes he cast
to Ianiquette, to whom says she, thou art little beholding to ye goodness of
fortune, that seames so great an enemy to the merit of thy beauty, for if
thy condition or calling would admit ye aduanceme^t, which the present
preferment of nature does offer the, no doubt thou sholdest become in short
time ye honor and decoration of al thy house, for touching the resolucion of
mine eyes and judgment of my conceit, proceeding of the devouring regardes
yonder gentleman casts toward the, he is not only ye bondsman of thy
beautye, but also so addicted to the service of the same, yt only thou
Ianiquette may dispose of him his honor and life and all that hehath. And truly
thou art not so happy to be the controller of so noble a cha^pion, as of
little discretion, if thou make small account of his service, which the veraye
greatest dames of our province, would reserve as a special relic or Jewel,
neither ought thou to make thy beautye of such price, as the respect thereof
should prevail above the goodness of so great an offer, saying that the walls
of this town do enclose a number of young Ladies and gentlewomen, that
exceeding the in beautye and bringyng up, would not seame curious in admittyng
the benefyt of so good a fortune.

Whereunto the honest Ianiquette^, that neither took pity of his pains, nor
allowed his endeavor, and less liked the perswacions of her companion, who
peradventure boarded her so far to make a prooffe of her honesty, replied no
less wisely, then with more discretion then commonly we note now a days in one
of her years.

If I were borne (quoth she) under thinfluence of fortune, or Ianiquetta
aunsvvereth her compaignion
bound to abide the sentence of her doom; I were not unlike to perform
thexspectation of thy allurementes, but seeing I am derived of a contrary
co^stellation, moostring always under the ensign and colors of virtue, I
have my salfe conduite at all times to withsta^de thinuasion of such
infections, with authority to defye the malice of any such accident. And
touching the co^mendacions which you seem to give to mon Seigneur Luchin, both
in the title of honor, estimacio^ of his public authority in thaffaires of
this city, together with his dexterity in all gifts incidente to a gentleman,
I say, ^he more plentifully he is considered at the hands of God with a
singularity in such ornaments, So much the more ought he to study to seame
worthy of so rare a participacion, not converting the virtue of his talent
given him from above, into a sinister entente and disposicion of wickedness to
seduce the chastetie of simple maids, whose faults (if any be) he ought
rather to reprehende with severity, the^ minister corrupcion contrary to the
commission of his honor, neither shall be at any time (I hope) prevail so
over my beautye, as the use of the same shall give him other contentement then
a frendlye ^oniour of the mouth, which all honest maids may do without
prejudice, thinking the friendship of nature of no greater moment in giuyng me
the title of fair, then the virtue meritorious in preserving the same
(according to the merit) without spott of infamye or worthy reproach of the
world, for her offense is double before God (says she) and treble skandalous
in the mouth of the multitude, that exchau^geth her beautye (being a chief
sign and argument of grace which God has painted in the face of a woman (as
the philosopher says) for any other price (how great so ever it appear) then
the honest pawn and gage of lawful matrimonye, according to thinstitucion
of our savior, who allowing chiefly the oblacion of chastetie, does condemn
the contrary into perentory destruction, and what have we in this world that
we ought to make so dear account of, as our honest name, being the thing
that yeldes us not only an admiracion whilste we enjoy the use of life upon
earth, but also makes us live after our death with a perpetual commendacion of
our integritye to the remeinder of our race. Doste not thou know (my dear
Maryone) that in the sweet and dewye mornings of the spring, there apperes
certain flowers no less delitefull to the beholders, then yeldynge an
odiferous smell with an inticynge desyer to be gathered so long as their
fragra^t and fresh perfumes indures, but when the heat of the son (perching
the galla^ds of Aurora) shall pearce through both boodd and root, and
mortifye the liuelye hew of such brickle creatures, the flower is not only
forgotten and loathed, which earste was so much embraced, but the desyer of
all men taken away as though there never had been any such, like wise ye
glistering apple growing upon the high spraies in the pleasant lands of
Angeau, semes a thing of great delectacion to the eye, and of no less
pleasante taste so long as he is entyer and without corrupcion, but after the
worm has either made a breach, or his greenes or pleasante maturitie lost his
force, and converted into a rotten ripeness, his beauty dekaies with desire
any longer to keep him, Even so a maid what poverty soever oppress her, so
long as she kepes unspotted her surname and title of chastetie, is not only
admitted, but also may chaleng place amongst the best of a country, but when
the caterpillor has once cropped the leaffe and deuow red the boodd, the tree
does not only die and perish with infamye, but the remembrance of such stock
and fruit remeines in the records of reproach to the opening of the great
book of general account, when al faltes shall be reueiled and punished according
to their disposicion and quality. And sewer it is better for a woman of what
degree soever she be, to die with honor, and buyrye the bourde^ of honest renowm
with her body in the grave, then enjoying the fruicion of life, to be marked
of the multitude with a note of general rebuke which (as a moothe in a
garment) will not cease to eat and devour her present estimacion, and make
notorious besides every age of her succession by the desert of her disordred
life, loasing the only cause that makes me joy in my self with so great
desire to live, wherein because I may the rather per form theffect of this last
resolucion, I will first with an unfeigned heart, make invocation to ye highest
for thassistance of his grace, to guard me from thassaltes and peppered
prouocations of the flesh, and then cut of all such occasions as may
eftesones advance the suggestion of the same, or seame any way an ympedimente
to the vow I have presently made, which I doubt not will be arms sufficient
enough to repulse ye alarams of Signeur Luchyn, and raise ye siege which I see
he has planted against the fortress of my chastetie, wherein she omitted not
thexecution, for from that instante, she kept her self unseen of any, but
her friends and kinsefolkes, coming little or nothing abroad, and less
willing to be spied out of windows or stand at the door, leauinge thereby an
example worthy of ymitacion to all estates and sorts of women, but specially,
such gigges, and pratlinge houswiues, as can not content them selves with
the air of the house, nor give one prick with the nedle, oneless she sit at
the doare, as though her exercise were only to menteyne chatt with the
street walkers, or keep a standing and make challenge against all comers,
which is the thing, that (you mothers) and tutours of little girls ought
chyefly to respect in the direction of your tender charges, I mean to bridle
and bring up your pupilles and ympes that have follye tied on their backs,
in the awe of correction, and if they transgress the order of good government,
you must not forgett to offer them the rack and torments of the rod,
which, you must minister unto them in the greenes of their yer es, and affore
the tendrenes of youth with want of discrection will suffer them to discern
their own inclinacion, for as the Philosopher terms them, to be a kind
of cattle more apt to declyne, then any other reasonable creature, so says
he) if they get once the bit between their teethe, and crop of the hearbee of
ryotus will, it is harder to reclayme them either hy awe, fear, compulsion or
gentle entreaty, then the wild haggard or rammish falcon by any conning or
devise of their keeper, besides as a maid is a Jewel of no less great price,
then rarely to be found, so she is a vessel most bryckle and easy to be
broken, and being once either crackte or corrupted, she lives in none other
account then in common wonder of the people and pointed at of all the world.

Wherefore, you mothers that in the bringyng up of your daughters, will give
ashowe of your own virtue, with no less care of the honor of your children,
must forgett to pamper your younglines with presents of their wills, or
dandle them upon the lapp of dame folly, but feed them The norsse.
rather with the discipline of good nouriture, not sparing the order of due
correction, least you spill the future hope and expectation of their well
doing, and better it is to have a maid smell of honest simplicity, using a
temperate scile^ce in her toungue and order of talk, then (ytalianated in
legerdemaines of subteltye, and pricked full of the feathers of foolyshe pride),
to have the tongue of a popingaie, bablinge without order or discrecion, for
that the one is a virtue of it self, and the very line to lead her to
advancement, and in practisinge the other, she procures a discredit to her
parents for their necligence in her education, and her self but laughte at in
the company of wise and discrete dames, and that (which worse is) led by such
guides into the botome les pit of everlasting infamye: Remember thaduise of
Marcus Aurelius who writing of the slipper disposition of some women, with
instruction to abridge the perentory humor which nature has given them,
gyues this general charge to all governors of nourceries and tutors of little
girls, that they stand so sewerly upon the guard of thonnour of their
charges, that they neither be seen out of windows, stand as stales at the
door, suffered to visit any place of thordynarie hawnte of men, called to
secret conference without commission or company of her keapor, but also barde
thaccesse and presence of all men, for that (says he) the ill can not be
utterly prevented, onelesse the causes that may procure it be clean taken
away, neither is it possibe for a Lady to keep the reputacion of her honor,
that makes her self incidente to the hawnte of great companies, with desire to
be a common feast maker and visit every banquet, and the more she is innested
with honor and high calling, the more care is due to the preservation of so
great a title, and less liberty or license is enjoined her to raunge a broad
or seek to satisfy thappetit of her pleasure, and her falte of treble
slander in the mouths of the blasphemous number, which albeit is without the
compass of my history, yet I thought it not unmeet to note this little
remembrance, both to warn them that use less care, then is necessary to
preuente so great a mischief, and to wish all Ladies to account their
honor, as the gift of god and special ornament of their life, which I could
enlarge with copy of authorities, if I had the assistance of convenient time,
and consent of my history, willinge me now to repair to ^aniquette who
perswadinge great impossibility in a young maid of intisinge beauty
desierus to enncownter thamarus glees of men, and keep cacquett with all
comers, to escape either without some great falte in thabuse of her body, or
at least to leave occasion of suspicion and Ieleus opinion of her honesty,
among such as use commonly to record the life and doings of great Ladies,
loughte to preuente the like accidente with a contrary virtue, for keeping her
self (for the most part) within the house of her father, she barred
thaccesse of Luchyn, and closed her eyes from the view of his presence, and if
at some time her affairs required her to visitt the doare, and Luchyn (by like
chance) reiterate his appeal with semblable somonce and salutacions of
accustomed courtesy, she fixed her eyes upon her work, dissemblinge not to
see the thing which her heart cold not brook, and her eyes detested to
behold, and douting that under the vail^ of that masqued humility and kind
of courtinge not convenient for her calling, might lurk some secret
mischief and displeasure of doble consequence, she seemed to abhor both the
one and the other with equal detestacion, and converting his sighs into air,
and tears to pay him the hier of his folly, she seamed only to supply the
whole time of her being there, in the company of her companions, leaving pore
Luchyn no less amassed at theys new toys and tricks of a haggarde, then (at
the first) he took pleasure, when she requited him with semblable glee, al
which notwithstanding cold neither discourrage him from the pursuit of the
resolucion of his mind, nor put him in despair of his future fortune,
thinckynge that time would remove the veil of her rigor, and convert her into
a creature more pliable, assisted therein with thoppinio^ of such as accompting
small conquest of things gotten with little labor, do yield the greateste glory
to that which is won with thertremitie of time and travel. And being still
norished with the hope of victory, renewed eftesones his purmenades and
palewalkes affore herdoare, aduauncing him self so farfurth sometimes, that he
entered into devise and discourse of love, albeit so coldly, that the same
neither declared thymportance of his desire, nor bewrayde the present passion
of his mind, whereunto notwithstanding she gave so slender regard, that her
reply dismissed him with no less contentemente for the present, then
lykelihood of better success hereafter. It is a custom amongst the Ieneueys
and all the province about, that the young men, having poeseys of flowers, and
meting their mistresses in the streets or elsewhere may present them there
with, without any mislike or cause of suspicion of the people, being also a
note of no less courtesy, for the woman having flowers in her hand or
bossome, to make like return to her servant, which kind of courtyng
thamarus Luchyn forgatt not too prefer as a testey of his service and furtherer
of his suit, for watchynge long time the hawnte of his mistres, he found her
at last not only aloane and void of compainie, but in place convenient to
put his long request upon terms, which, gretinge of fortune or gift of
happy chance, if it were welcomme to him, I leave it to the judgment of
such, as languishynge in the like disease, dare neither discover their grief,
nor demand their due remedy, and having (of purpose peradventure) certain
Ielly flowers in his hand, which were of more price, because winter raged
then with extremity of could, the chiefeste enemy too flowers and tender
boods on thearth, he saluted her with his request in this sort.

If the continuance of my service were hable to warrant Luchyne vvoeth
Ianiquaette.
me at length, the merit of the same, or the offer of any hope (in ye mean
time) had virtue to procure moderation to my passion, the one should not end
but by the sentence of death, and the other would I embrace as a special
preserver of my life, but seeing the one is of no less momente with you, then
the other unlikely too happen, I am driven to exclaim against your beauty,
as the only cause of my grief, and entire enemy to my rest, but chieflye
thunnaturall rigor which you suffered, to rampire him self so depely in
thintralles of your heart, and seele your eyes of compassion, against me, that
you will neither admit, my tears, sighs, and other pitiful regardes without
number, whereof the pale complexion of my face, with other trembling joints of
therterior parts, have made sufficient declaracion, nor credit the infynit
simptomes and thundringe alarams which the only glymmeringe view of your
beauty, ceasseth not to minister to the weak forces of my feeble heart, who as
your prisoner, ready to resign the keys and castle of his liberty, is hear
become the pitiful solycitor of his own cause, coniuringe you by that compassion
which ought to accompany so rare and precious an ornamente of nature, to
remove at last the veil of your former cruelty, and in beholdinge what
power love has given you over me, to dismiss all delays of comfort, and
admit me into your service, that have vowed never to depart out of the least
of your commandments, whereunto she was driven to answer, rather by
compulsion of the place and time, then any desyer to debate with him in a
matter of such vanity.

The merit of your service (Sir says she,) is far greater, then I can or may
grant his due meede, and your passion Ianiquetta aunsvvereth Luchyn.
like to be restored by her that is ignorante of the cause, and less knows
the order of your disease, And touching the rest of your protestacion,
coated rather with arguments of illusions and subtle ceremonies to seduce my
simplicity, then any resemblance of virtue or intent to expose the fruits
of true affection, I can not answer with other terms, then just disdain
of your liberal offer, with little care you use to the reputacion of mine
honor, neither is it to me that you ought to address this ambushe or train
of allurementes, considringe the inequality of our houses, denies a consent
of marriage, and to grant love to one that craves it in other sort then
thinstitucion of that sacred law does allow, I think if no less detestable
before god, then a spot of perpetual infamye, which time it self can not raze
out of the remeynder of my house, and small honor is it for you to pursue a
queste of so little a veil, whose beginning as it proceeded of a superfluytie
of found humors, raginge without reason or guide of virtue, so the
contynuance will ymporte but a discredit to your calling, and the end, yield you
neither content me^t nor commendacion, wherefore I pray you suffer, thassurance
of my virtue to work her force, who in correctinge the ronning appetit of your
folly, will make you master of your self, and let not so vain a thing as
the simple glaunce of beauty (which is more apt to declyne then hable to
endure) prevail above your aunciente estimacion of honor, nor draw you without
the lymittes and bonds of your calling, for, for my part, I have enclosed
mine honor and life together in one vessel, with intent to make a present of
them both at one instant to him, whom I beseech may God.
take away your trance, and restore you to your entyer, and defend me at

unworthy of your favor, or am I not likely to perform thoffer of my service:
both the one and the other, Quod Ianiqneta, for I ought not, nor will not,

and consent of my friends, shall enjoin me to marie, neither can you do
agreater wrong to your own estimacion, then in embasing your greatness, to become
the servant, of so pore a maid, as I, And albeit you were contented to make an
equallitie and indifferent distribucion of the greatness of your estate, with
the little estymacion that for tune has preferred me unto, yet the grudge of my
conscience quarrelling with the foulnes of ye act, will neither suffer me to

would not stick too destroy the maid to the end the note of such a fact

and give such a charge to the maid, that she should not find such conning to
confute her raisons, as she seamed valliant in the repulse of thassaltes of her
lover, who because his messeinger should not depart unarmed at all points, he
willed her to be no nigarde of large promises, offrynge wholl mounteines of
gold, silver, or Jewels, or any other thing of what price so ever it were,

only mary her to her conte^tacion, but make her portion worth a thousand
doccates: his neighbor albeit, her art was not to deal in messages of love,
and that she esteemed greatly the chastetie of maids, yet comparinge the
poverty of Ianiquette, with his present promise to releue it, gave him
eftesones a second assurance of her diligence, with protestacion to make her
strike sail and comme under his lee, wherein she was deceived, for neither
his large promises, nor presents of great price could persuade her, and

in hope or apt to be reliued by any industry of thy parents, who albeit have
he retofore enjoyed the goodness of fortune, and borne a port of honest
calling, Riches.
yet thowe seeste they are now in the danger of desolatio^, and fallen so
far into the malice of poverty, that they want means not only to supply
the needy disposicion of their own life, but also to prefer the to
aduauncemente due to thy deseruyng, I grieve no less also to see the flower of
thy youth slyp away by such stealthe, and the pyninge misery of thy parents to
be an impediment to the preferme^t of thy beauty, which albeit is honored of a
number with the offer of marriage yet when they have sifted thy state and tried
to thutermost the small inheritance and simple dowry of thy father, they do
not only disclayme their s^te, but seame to depart and break of, as though
they were infected with some contagius disease of your house, wherefore saying
the despair in thy parents ability takes away all hope of assistance at
their hands or by their means, and that fortune once in the course of our
life, does put into our hands the offer of a good torn: if thowe will
repose thy self upon my advise, I will set the in better state, then ever

My advise says she (I know will drive you into some amase at the first, as
a thing neither convenient for mine age, nor seamely for my calling, and
disagreing wholly from mine ancient order and custom of doing, albeit if
thou make a care of thy proffitt, thowe will not stick to pursue the benefitt
of thy fortune, neither will my council ymporte such prejudice for the

I have hard of late that there is a young gentleman in this town, so extremely
in love and desierous of thy beauty, that he accomptes nothing so dear as
the thing that may like the, and yeldeth detestacion to that which thou
loathest, neither would he spare the massy store of his treasure, or large
revenue of his living, nor stick to make the peril of his life, the price of
thy good will and favor, with this addicion also, that if thou will make him
the master of his request, and pass a grant of that he requires, to provide
the marriage to thy contentacion, with the dowry of a thousand doocates,
whereof I have commission to make the assurance: me thinks a falte don in
secrett, is half perdoned, and one offense bringes no custom of sin,
wherefore use thy discrecion, and think that time will dispatches the of him,
when thou maiste reatorne home laden with the spoil of his richesse and
Jewels. Here Ianiquette suppressing the just cause of her anger, with a
marvelous modesty, not commonly seen in one of her calling and bringing up,
seamed, for the only respect of the old years of her neighbor, to close her
mouth from open exclamacion against her lewd abuse, and aunsweringe with
more moderacion, then thimportance of her wrong required, replied in this
sort. Ianiquette reprehendeth^ the bavvde.


What villanye can be greater, then to make a common merchandise of that,
which ought not to be boughte but by virtue, or what disposicion of more
detestacion in any christyen, then for a woman to make a sale of her honor, and
measure so precious a Jewel, by the price of her proffit? Do you think, that
either the view of riches or Jewels or prodigal offers with large promises, are
hable to do more, then the long offer of service with general commendacion of
the gifts that be in him, which has suborned you to prefer this embassage?
or who is she of so villenus a nature, to with stand the sundry alarames of
tears, with pitiful somonce of so many sighs, and yield at length to the
detestable heralte of all corruption? No, no, if I had liked the bargain, my
consent had come freely, without the earneste pennye of Money.
filthye marriage, which you seame to prefer with an offer of a dowry,
confirmed by an assurance or warrantie of your commission, is it possible that
yeldinge him the flower of my virginity, to make a profession of true
frendshippe to any other, but that the blodde of shame will renew the
remembrance of my former falte? sewer if he prevail so far, and wyn that

shall he tryumphe long in the victory, nor I live to Lament the loss, for as
it is the true property of a pure maid to defend that ornament to thuttermost
gasp of her breath, and if by destenie, the force of the oppresser prevail
above her strength, to persecute him to death with the loss of her own life,
so if I be not hable to perform the one, these hands shall be the bloodye
ministers of the other to the great contentement of me, and open shame of him
that shall survive, for it is long since I was persuaded, that an honest death,
is the renown of the life passed, for ye rest, to thend the present wrong you
have don me, may serve hereafter to state ye course of your rashenes in the

dishonestie, I pray you persuade your self, that if you conclude and knitt up
the latter remeinder of your years in the practice of abominable endeavors,
the commendacion of your life passed, will be converted into the title of a
common bawd, swearyng unto you for my part by the faith of a pure virgin,
that if it were not for the respect of the honesty I have hitherto noted in
you, and honor that I owe to the old years and virtue of your age, I would so

neygbor, that was not so mystical in the conueigh of such trades, as diverse
of our chandellors and supersticious basket bearers in London, who not only
make a profession of baudrie, but live by the filthye gain procedynge of that
art, and having nothing to replye, desiered Ianiquetta to pardon her,
alledginge that the care and compassion she had of her poverty, procured those
terms, rather then any desyer to seduce her, and so departing with her short
shame, and less proffit, made particular relacion of her success to the
amarus Luchyn, who hearing the sentence of despair, seamed no less passioned
with present dollor, then if he had been sharpelye assailed with a fit of the
burning fever: he entered straighte way into the pageante of a madd man,
pasinge his chamber with uncertain steps, and throwing his arms a cross
upon his breast, with his eyes directed to the heavens, began to ymagyn how
to pass the misterye of this trance, which soddaine scilence served chiefly
as a special supply, to restore the war with contraryetye of his thoughts,
for the more he went about to extirpp the remembrance of his mystres, and
committ her to utter oblivion, the more he made him self subject to her
beautye, and grafted more strongelye the roots of affection in the bottom of
his heart.

And sewer it is no small matter for a man that is in love, pursewing the good
will of his Lady with contynuall importunityes, the space of two or three
years, and receive nothing but the offer of a vain and uncertain hope,
which feeds the mind with such suggestions and arguments of good success,
that every repulse seames to present a flattering favor, and the breath of
every rigorous word, importes an intisinge allurement, until despair
(blowing the retraite of that war, do publishe his commission to dismiss all
hope and likelihood of future success.

The large feldes enuyronnynge the great city of Ieyne, seamed to lack
skoape and compass to comprehend the multitude of thoughts, with diversity
of ymaginacions, that even now, occupied the head of Luchin, who exclaymynge
upon the haggarde disposition of his mistres, forgatt not also to forge cause
of complaint against love, for that as a blind guide, he had ladd him into
the bottomless golphe of fancy, and leauyng him there ready to be devoured
with the raginge waves of affection, would not show him the way to comme out,
and eschew so great and present a peril, albeit he ought rather to have
reprehended his own simplicity, and weakness of sprite, which (with the want
of assurance in virtue) made him subject, to that, which all wise men ought
to govern with awe and correction, I mean the sensual appetites and
prouocations of the flesh, which are or ought to serve, as slaves, to the
place and house of our raison.

Luchyn prolonging his passion with an increase of disquiet, seamed to fall
from complaints of dule, into terms of surye, and feedinge altogether upon
the herb and appetit of rage, suffered him self, to be so much infected with
the humor of frenzy, that his wrath was turned into woddnes, wherein as the
desperate lover does seldom measure his sleep, by the length of the nights,
so he seamed here to excede the ravenous order of the gredie wolf, huntinge
his uncerteine pray in the dark, for some time he rolled upon a bed, and some
time wallowed upon the rushes in the flore, and now and then, for a change of
exercise, he tried the hardness of the posts, with the knockes of his head, and
albeit he had the liberty of a long gallery, with five or six chambers to
roue and run at his pleasure, yet judging the same not circuit sufficient to
contain the circumstance of his passion, he committed one part of his
discourse to the witness of ye air, within a fair garden, yelding prospecte to
the window of his gallery, where making inuocacion to the moon (as the
lantern that then gave light to the earth) craved that she would open her
vessels of pity, and let fall some drops of consolacion in a shower of
moisture, to quench the burning heat of his torments, which he thought
were thondred upon him, rather by the sentence, and dome of his angry
destenie, then as a desert and due merit of his own folly, and being in
despair to dispatche him self out of that danger, confirmed here by
experience, the opinion of the Philosopher, who treating de Fragilitate humana,
describes the gates and fore front of the pallaice of mischief, to be
painted with allurementes and enticinge prouocations to enter, but being
within, you fall (says he) ymediately into the pit of torments, worse then
the goolphe or lake of hell, ne^yther can you have saffeconduitt too retire at
your pleasure, argewynge hereby that it is far easyer, to fall into the hands
of danger, then to purchasse a dispense of peril, and that the diseases be
more ordinary and common, then the remedy ready to restore the patient.

Yt was both pleasure and pity, to here him quarrel with his fortune, with
complaint of his mishap, sometime blamyng the simplicity and faintnes of his
courage, in yelding his heart prisoner, and him self captiff to so mean a
personage, and to convert the benefit of his former liberty into a continual
care and desiere of a beauty, less durable then the flickering gloss of the
fresh marigolde, mostering in Orient coullers all the day, till the
declininge of the son do so^on him to resign and retire to a withered
stalk, and omittyng no sort of exclamacions, he accused greatly thimbecilitye

of thimperfection of them selves, and ordained (from the beginning) to be
their vassals, and at commandment to serve them in their necessary
affairs, but, by and by he seamed to quarrel with his rash imputacion, in
blaspheming so unworthily that noble sect, wherewith examining the deformity
and wantes in him self, resolved the same to be the cause of her just disdain
and his evil fortune: for (says he) I have known diverse (favored with the
gifts of nature and assistaunce of courtlike education), that have reapte
other rewards of their service, then the rigor of my mistres will expose,
neither is there any woman, how simple so ever she be, that has not a
capacity to discern both good and ill, and judgment to consider, the meritt
of him that makes her a present of his service: At last he fell into terms
of commendation of his mistres, with repeticion of her gifts and virtue,
wherein accomptynge her the paragon of his time, he wished her derived of some
noble house, to the end the greatness of her race, might give increase to the
renown of her virtue and chastetie, which he thought but to constante, for
the purpose he went about, desi^ringe to enjoy her, but as his secrett
frinde, and convert her into a fountain to satisfy the thirste of his
pleasures, wished that such immouable consta^cie and perfection of mind, might
find always place of abode in such as men do choose for their wives, and
lawful compagnions of their bed, wherewith as he filled the air with the
sighs of his complaints, and fedd the eyes of his mind with a secret
contemplation of his cruel mystres, the messenger of of Aurora, pronownsinge
the approach of the day, in discoueryng certain skarlett beams of the son,
in the bottom of the east firmament, gave end too his discourse, which was
begone at the rysynge of the moon and whether it were that the long complainte
of his grief, hadd brought some moderation to his passion, or themptines of
his brain for want of sleep, moved him to putt confydence in dreams, or
whether a new suggestion of the sprite, which first possessed him, presented
a fresh hope or Love.
lykelyhood of that which he ought to have for gotten, or what it was, it is
harder to judge, then easy to eschew, but entringe into a little arbor or
cabynet curiously deckte with diverse bows and branches of odiferous smell, he
took his lute and recorded his sorrow, in the tune of an old song, which he
found written of long time by a Poet, shodd with the same Iron, and wounded
with a semblable weapon, the end of which dolerus record, seamed to importe
such soddaine consolation, that having thereby (as it were a present pasport
of his former passion) gave judgment with them that are stricken with the
serpents of Tarrantyne, that music is a chyefe mean to break the bed of
fancy, and preuente despair ready to invade the dowtefull mind, which gave
him courage eftesones to commence a second harmony, whose end stirred up a
remembrance of his former sorrow, and restoring a fresh alaram of his amarus
thoughts, made him ymediatly abandon his lute and books of music, and
going to bed he accounted some ease to lie hidd under his canapie, hopinge
that being oppressed with sleep, the conceit of his dream, serving as a
lokynge glass for contemplacion of his mistres, would bring him some
contentmente and dispense of his dollor, which as it is a kind of cold
consolacion, and pleasure of no great delight, with less continuance, so it
includes comparison of the lovers estate, with the order of little children, who
when they weep, are pleased with tryffles, delytinge more in the lollynge of
the nursse: then in the offer of A monarke.

But now to Ianiquetta, who during the solitary time, and desolate aboade of
Luchyn, in his house, was married by the travel and assistance of her friends,
to a mariner or master of a shipp, whose trade was to conueye the marchantes
of all parts, from port to port, as their traffic and trade required: this
marriage was no sooner performed in the church, but fame fyllynge the ears of
LVCHYN, made him partaker of the news, with advise to renew the earneste of
his fomer bargayne with a doble diligence, and treble desyer, preferrynge (as
it were) an assured hope of spedye victory, the rather for that he accounted
the marriage a convenient mean to cover the falte of his foul desire, wherein
he received a success of his former attemptes, for she that detested his
endeavor, being at liberty, thought the offense of doble disposicion in
offendynge God and the world in breaking the league of her faith and vow of
obedience to her husband* whose simplicity and state subject to need and
lack, Luchyn forgatt not to feed with large proffers of his frendshyppe, in
such sort as what with the hope of his assistance, and fear of the
authority he bare then in the city, he had him (as it were) in a famyliar
awe, neither suspectynge his access too his house, nor mislikynge his
conference with his wife, of whom notwithstanding he could not obtain but
the use of words, which as she durst not deny, for the respect of awe and
honor which her husband bare to him, so having a notable wisdom joined
with her rare gift of chastetie, reposynge her self in the grace of GOD, to
defend her honor, kept his meaning secrette, and would not communicate the
fowlenes of his intent to any and much less to her waspishe husband,
leaving in example to all Ladies, not sufficient in virtue, rather to resyste
all such alarams of theyme selves, or at least make a secrett concealment,
then in bewraynge their own weakness to breed a bees neste, in the heads of
their husbands with reaportes of small substance.

But now the amarus traffic of Luchyn, and common haunte to the mariners
house, began to breed a doubt of his doing amongst his nearest friends, who
not knowinge of the marriage of IANIQVETTE, ymagyned what might happen, and (as
careful gardeines of their nephewe) studied to prevent the wourste, wherefore
least thalluremente of her beauty and disposicio^ of his folly, might
unhappily conclud, a secret contract between them, they accosted him one day
with earnest request, that in ceassing at last to pursewe the wanton
instigacions of his youth, he would cross sail and retire to a trade of
honest life, wherein say they (very loath The friends of Luchyn persuade him
to mary age and amendment of life.
to offend him) albeit we have no great cause to infer ymputacion of any
heinous enormytie, or desorder not conueniente, yet saying the pleasante time
of your young years slipp away, under a veil of vain and barreine life,
whose sequeile (if in time you abridge not the race of your Ronninge course)
argues no small inconvenience to your self, with great discredit to your
dead father, we have thought good to enter into devise for preseruinge of that
which yet remeines, and to prevent the malice of future time, wherefore Honor
and living.
according to the credit, and resolved trust reaposed in us, by your late
father, the very remembrance of whom, restores us to a special care and
zeal of your honor and well doing, we wish you to convert this idle and
desolate order of living, into a disposicion and desire of honest marriage,
whereby you shall not only deceive thexspectacio^ of yt had sort, deuyninge
already of your destruction, but eschew the sentence of ordinary mischief,
appointed to fall upon such, as wallowing in sensual pleasures, regard not
the honor and estimacion of their house, and which appears even ready, to
thonder upon you, if you dispatche not your self of the principal cause of
this great and ymynente misfortune, wherein for a declaracion of the special
care we have of you, we present you hear with a frank offer of our traueile,
diligence and council, to be ready at all times to assiste you in the choice of
her, whom god shall enjoin you to make the lawful com panion of your bed.

The young man understanding sufficiently their intent, cut of their further
discourse with his promise, not only to make spedie exchange of his former
trade, but also commits him self wholly to their discrecion and wysedomes,
with resolucion to be ready to enter into marriage with such one, as they
judged, of equalytie, and every way convenient for his condition and calling,
wherein there was such expedicion of diligence used by his friends, that within
a space of two or three months, he was married, no less richely, then
honorably, and to a beauty sufficient to content a reasonable man, whereof if
any rejoiced with good cause, I think it was poor Ianiquette, who perswadinge
herself, to be ryd by this means of an ymportunat clyent, blessed the goodness
of her fortune, in prouidinge so well for thennemye of her honor, and
deliueringe her with honesty from ye danger of his charms, albeit her
conceyte was answered with a contrary success.

corruption, by a contynual desire of filthy gain Nothing (...) sausfye the

that (as Aristotle says) nothing is hable to satisfye the couetusnes of man,
Euenso thinfection of love (after he have once prevailed above the wholesome
parts in us) is of such wonderful operacion that he does not only, choke the
gift of our understanding, in such sort as we are found more apt to embrace
the things that be hurtful, then hable to follow the loare of wisdom and
virtue, but also takes away the respect and duty of our conscience, which
you may easily descerne in the discurse of this Luchyn, who notwithstanding
the vow he made to god, and honor that every man ought to give to marriage,
cold not content him self, with the company of his own wife, but renewed his
resort with alarames of fresh ymportunyties to poor IANIQVETTA, which
being noted and spied diverse times of his wife, made her doubt that which was
not, and albeit she was resolved of a participacion and equality of love, yet
she feared not much that the mariners wife, deceived her of any thing that
she accounted due to herself, for that the common reaport of her chaste and
honest life, assured her of the contrary, chieflye she repined that so vain a
hope, should wythdrawe him from her company, feling with all a certain want
in thaccomplishment of the exercise and desire of the bed at hoame.

And truly as there is nothing more hurtful to the breach of amytie between the
good man and wife, then when the stronger part, conuertes his affection

bequeathinge besides to the succession of his house a dowry of perpetual
slander, which is skarcely subject to the expyracion of time.

His wife Laid before him the whole circumstance of his falte, with the general
brute that passed daily through all the streets of IEYNE, together with the
wrong he did to the reputacion of the poor IANIQVETTA, whose honesty (says
she) albeit is without just cause of reprehencion, yet have you brought it in
question amongeste the slanderous sort, whose judgments are always
according to the malice of their disposicion, desieringe him for end, in
dismissinge his former trade, to wythdrawe his access, least he purchased not
the like preferment for himself, that he sought to procure to an other, to
whom albeit he could not deny the frendeshippe he bare to IANEQVETTA, yet he
excused the same not to ymporte any prejudice to the behalf of his wife, with
further protestacion, that IANEQVETTA was one of the paragons of honesty, that
our age did norishe, and the respect of her virtue, was thonlye cause of his
admiracion, procuringe chieflye his recourse The babble of of the people is

forgeuenes of the falte, promissinge her from thinstante, to correct the humor
of his former folly, and become such one on her behalf, as her honest
modesty and other virtues deserved, wherewyth he closed so sewerly the mouth
of his wife, that long after he lived free from the tumulte of such
quarrels, and she (not void of suspicion) dispused her self, to contentmente
by force, with exspectacion to see an end of the dance, thexpedition whereof,
exceded her ymagynacion, for within a short time after the maryner, making
sail into Sardynia, was incowntred by certain pirottes, and sent prisoner to
CALLARIA a town subject to the turkishe gouernmente, with no small desolacion
to his wife, who as one deprived of her chiefeste stay and comfort, and
ouercharged with a number of little children, whose sustentacion depended
wholly upon the travel of their father, is now void of means to succor
them, and that which pinched more greuouslye, was the general darthe ye
overwhelmed all the Land in such sort that a sack of corn, was seldom sold
under nine or ten Duckattes, which arguing great distress to the state of
poor IANIQVETTA, chiefelye for that she was denied habylitye to redeem her
husband, and also in despair of means to releue her children, cryinge
contynuallye for meat, began to prefer in her a faintnes of courage, and ye heart
whom the whole assaltes of love, and long importunityes of Luchyn, his great
presents and proffers, with promises of large price, could not once stir
or remove from the seat of constancy, feles now such an alteracion of
fortune, that she is at point to surrender (of her self), that, which
neither power nor pollecie could put to utterance. And albeit the extremity
of her case ministered persuacio^s to make an offer of her self to him that of
long had served her in heart, with suit for her good will, yet the grudge of
so great an offense, preferrynge arguments to the contrary, wylled her rather
to exchange her present life and former reuowme with death, then live with
the spott of so foul an act, wherein waighinge thus in the balance of
doubteful ymaginacio^s, pinched extremely with two of the greatest plages of
the world, the lamentable noise of her children, cryenge for food with open
mouth, as the young bird in the rooffe, complayninge in his kind upon

desolate mother, that only their rage and infirmitye forced her to a
determinacion of that which earste she detested to remember, a marvelous force
sewer of necessity, who as she is the mistres of arts, so her malice importes
such a distress, that it makes us many times abuse the goodness of our nature,
in committyng things which neither honor nor conscience can iustifye, for
what greater mischief could she have thondred upon this pore woman, then in
depriuynge her of natural and womanly^e shame, to compel her to make sale of
her honor, for the sustain of her self, and supporte of her miserable
children, whose doleful tunes exclayming against their wretched mother that had
not to satisfye the rage of their hunger, restored her eftesones to such
pity, that she addressed her self, immediately to the lodging of Luchin, who
walkinge all alon in his base court, was no less astonyed to see her there,
then she ashamed to be at the point, to yield him a villainous homage, if god
had not been the protector of her chastetie. And being affore him with face
and garments besprente and dyed with the drops of her watery eyes, she fell
flatt at his feet, yelding her honor to his orde under thies terms.

Albeit (sir) says she, the prince or captain, that has often somoned his
enemy to surrender his hold, and he (denienge such offers) does merteyne the
quarrel even until Necessetie forces Ianiquette to offer her self in pray
to Luchyn.

put him to the sword, and his city to utter saccage, yet the glory of that
conquest will appear greater, and honor the captain with treble fame, if in
preferryng compassion affore the rigor of justice, he admit the captives to
favor, sparing to spill the blood of such as willingly yield their heads to
the block under the stroke and edge of his sword, neither is any man (of what
degree so ever he be) of such commendacion either for his courage, bowntie or
other qualities and orname^tes of nature, as worthelye honored with veneration
for the gift of compassion and pity, which as it is a virtue exceeding all
the rest, so (by the advice of the scripture) she is chiesly to be declared
on the behalf of such wretches, as fallen into danger and distress, by
offendynge the prince or his people in office, have nothing to prevent the
malice of ye law and just meede of their deserte, but thexpecta^cion and hope
in the fruits of so precious a virtue: I say thusmuch (sir) to sturr up your
humor of compassion, and dismissing the remembrance of all offenses paste, to
extend present pity to your poor Ianiquette, who if ever she offended you,
is here come to yield her to your mercy, and taking such vegance as you
think good, to ymploye her further in the service that best may like you,
only I commend unto your goodness, the wretched state of my children, whose
miseries accompained with a contynuall cry for releeffe, has here presented
me prostrat at your feet, kissing ye same with no less humylitie, then sign
of submission with request eftsoon to accept the offer of your hand maid,
in recompense of the wrong I have heretofore don you, but chiefly (alas) to
redeem my children from the rage and vyolence of hounger, and prolonge their
lives that ought not yet to take end by the Law and course of nature.

in remembrance, yt the glory can not be great, where the victory is won by
unlawful means, neither cold he tryumphe in a better conqueste, then, in
ouercommynge him self, to dismiss her without vyolacion, wherefore comparing
her former constancy, with the extreme causes that procured her present
offer, respectinge also the duty of his own conscience, did not only
determyne to assiste her poverty with succor of sustentacion, but also to
abstain his hands from deflowringe, so rare aparagon, wherewyth he took her
from the ground, and kissing her watery chieke, said unto her, do away these
tears of dule, and convert the remembrance of ancient sorrow, into an
unfeigned hope of present consolecion, Luchyn co^pforteth Ianiquetta.
reapose your self upon the virtue of your invincible chastetie, and ymagyne
you have received the due meritte of the same, for, for my part, god forbidd,
that the malice of your present necessity (yeldynge you into my hands)
should make me greedy to get that, which love cold not conquer, nor spo^le
you of the thing which I ought and will hold in chief veneracion, wherein
being thus by your virtue made master of my self, I feel also mortefied in me
the wanton suggestions, which erst moved me to love only the beauty and body
of Ianiqueta, and now that reason is be come my guide and distress rather then
love, has made you thus prodigal of your honor, for the sustentacion of your
children, yt shall suffice me, to have you at my commandment without any
affore of wrong to your estimacion or honesty, And as your chastetie does
challenge her reward, so because it is you that is to glory in the gift of so
great a virtue, and I to yield tribute, for that treason I have wroughte you,
I assure you here in the mouth of a gentleman, not only to furnish you of all
things necessary, with honor and estymacion equal to mine own sister, but
also to be as careful of your reputacion, as heretofore I have sought to
seduce and spot it with lascivious infamy.

Ianiquetta was restored here to doble contentment, both to have her pudicitie
respected, and undoubted assurance of the liberal promise of the courteous
Luchyn, which she would eftsoon have acknowledged with an humble prostitucion
and kissinge of his feet, but that he (not liking such supersticious
reverence), prevented her intent, and presented her by the hand unto his
wife, with these words

grudge is never appeased, till thoffendor be punished, I, have here brought
you, the cause of your greatest doubt, with the vision that so many nights,
has appeared in your dream, and broken the sweet course of your natural
sleep, enioyninge you full authority, to commit her to what penance you will,
giuinge the stroke of vengance at your own discrection, to whom she answered,
that if she had no more cause to be doubtful of his doings, then raison to
be Ielous of the honesty of the poor woman, she had been as free from
suspicion as far from cause of disquiet, neither had her eyes any cause to
complain of thimpediment of sleep, nor her brain so often assailed with the
Alaram of hollow dreams, for thexperience and proof of her virtue (says
she) did always assure me of her honestye, which yett will not stowpe to
the malice of thee time, nor loase the glory of her renowmee, although
fortune have laid her heavy hand upon her, in taking a way her husband,
which temperat modesty in his wife, doubled his affection, with confyrmation
of a sincere good will toward her for ever. And in recitinge the last
chance and discourse passed between him and Ianiquette, he said that if she
knew in what sort, he had kept his faith toward her, she would not doubt
to put him on the phile of most true and loyal husbands, willing her to take
her and furnishe her with all provision and other things necessary with no
less care and liberal allowance, then if it were for his dear sister,
whereunto she put no less expedicion, then her self had cause to rejoice in
the honest continencye of her husband, all which being made immediately a
common brute through the city, became also of great wonder amongst the
people, as well for that thinstigation of hard necessity, had made Ianiquette
ployable to that, which she has long refuced with great detestation, as also
for the heroical virtue of the gentleman, who abhorring the wicked offer of
fortune and time, converted his lascivious desire, norished in his intralles,
by so long contynuaunce, into a disposicion of virtue, contrary to the
exspectation of all men.

An example suer worthy of great veneracion, and wherein the sensual
appetites are so restrained, and governed by the rule of raison, that I doubt
whether the Romans, have noted more continencye in their Fabia, Emilya, or
Scipyo, or the Grecians in their old Xenocrates, who is not so meritorious of
commendation, for that being charged with years, he Xenocrates refused a yo^g
maid laid in bed with him.
made a proffe of his chastetie, as this Luchin who in ye glory of his age,
and full of the hoatt humors of youth, made a conqueste of his affections,
with a wonderful show of virtue, and undoubted sign and assurance of the
perfection of his faith, for which cause I have noted unto you his hystorye,
which also I wyshe might serve to stir up the frail youth of our days to
the ymitacion of the like virtue, remembryug by the view of this discourse,
that the sensual appetites and provocation of the flesh, are not of such
force, but they are subject to correction, neither is love so invincible, but
the wise and virtuous man, may keep him always in awe, so that he give him
not to much liberty at the first, nor creaditt to much the instigation and
humor of his own fancy.

FINIS.
The argument
WHose youth and years of folly, have made an experience of the disposition of
love, and such as he infecteth with his frantike poison, tryenge in like sort
the difference between the vanities of the world, and the contemplacion of
celistiall things, or other virtues of divine operacion upon earth, openinge
(as it were) to all degrees of mortalytie an entrey or way to come to the
glory and honor of theuerlastinge Paradise above: to such (I say) may I
boldly appeal, for confirmacio^ of thauncient opynion grounded in the
stomakes of men from the beginning, that the beauty and flattering behavior of
a woman, is the true and natural Adamant, seeing that, that stoane, (by a
certain virtue attractiue, and special gift by nature) has not such power
to force and draw the heavy iron unto it, as the secret mystery, hydden in
the eyes and face of a woman, are of authority, to sommon and steal
thaffections and hearts of men: which has wrought a resolucion, or thing of
most certeintie amongst a number of men now a days, that such charms and
serpentine allurementes, were sent a mongeste us from above as well to
tormente our pleasure, as also (in so^e sort) to give ease to thafflictio^ of
such as are vnhappelie contrybutors to that poisoned participacion: wherein as
we have long marueiled why Paris forsook the delites of Troy, to become the
thrall of Helene in greece, what moved one Hercules to abandon his beauye mase,
and clubb of conquest, to depend whollye upon the commandment of his women
friend, or how Solomon, abused the gift of his wisdom, to commit folly,
with her, who only governed him, yt guided the whole monarkye, so, behold I
have to increase your wonder with a true po^rtrayte or picture, of a more force
in a woman, and folly in a man, who, with out any use of former or hope of
future favor, sauinge to fulfill the fond appetit of his folishe mistrys,
habandoned the use and benefytt of his speech for three years, putting on (by
that means) the shapp of brutalitie, between whom and the creatures of
understanding, the philosophers conclude an only difference of the use of
reason, and speech. A case (sewer) no less notorious for the rary^tie that
way, then declaringe a singular force of nature in the subject upon whom she
seames to bestow such prehemiuence above all other mysteries upon earth,
whereof may serve for sufficient proof theffeminate alteration in Hercules,
the decrease of strength in Sampson, the loss of wisdom and understanding
in Solomon, and the simplicity of this gentleman, whose discourse follows.

THE CRVELTIE OF A Wydowe in enioyninge her woer to a penance of three years
loss of his speech, the foolish loyalty in him in performinge her
commandment, and the mean vvherby he was revenged of her rigor..
AMongeste the lymytrophall towns con ynynge the borders of Pyemount, no man
dowtes (I think) that the City of THVRYN, being thonly lantern to give
light to all the provinces there about, for eiuill orders and integrity of
conversation, is not also, a chief rampire and sewer bulwark to her own
country, against thincurcion of enemies, neither is it of less estimacion for
the natural scituacion of the place, then bewtified greatly by thin dustrius
endeavor of man, addinge (as it seames) a more decoratio^ of late to that town,
then either nature or the slender devise of men in times passed cold ymagyn.

Somewhat without the suburbs of this rich and populus City, is planted in a
pleasant valley, a little village called Montcall, worthy every way to be
joined in neighbourhead to so great a City, being environed on the one side with
the fragrant air of the fertile feldes al to bedewed with the sundry sweet
smelles of thincense of Aurora, and on the other side with ye lofty hills,
breathing from the mouth of Zephire the air of health, to refresh in time of
need the drowsy tenants of the valley, which (amongst other happy influences
of the heavens) seemed also to have aspecial favor of the gods, to bring forth
and norish the most fair, verteous, curtoyse ladies yt cold be found in any
one corner of Europe, amongst who^ not withstanding there was not long since a
young widow called Zilya, who declyning from ye disposition of ye clymat and
planet of her nativity, became so hagarde like, and enclyned to cruelty, that
she seemed rather to take her beginning, among the deserts and craggie places of
Scauoye, then too suck the breasts of the delicat norsses in the pleasante
champayn, refreshed by the beautiful hand of Erydan, sometime called the
father of ryuers, and now termed by the title of Po, whose crystal channells
and silver streams, (deuydynge them selves into diverse distillinge brokes) do
not only drive men into admiration, but also draw them to become neighbors
to alicour of such delight.

This disdainefull wydowe, and enemy to all courtesy, although she hadd asyet
skarcely entered into the twenty and fourth year of her age, yet she persuaded
her self herafter to abandon utterly the society of man, whether it were by
marriage or otherways, aduowing to spend the remeynder of her years in
singlenes of life, a resolucion (truly) both godly and commendable, if the
tiklishe motions of the frail flesh, would be content to obey, the wholesome
exhortacions of the sprite.

But whereas our declynyng bodies pampred in all delicacye, together with the
unruly appetites, ragynge after wilful desire, do seem to quarrel with our
chastetie, and vanquishe all resistance, the council of thapostell is to be
followed, who wills that we marie in christ, to auoyed the danger of the
soul, and common slander of the world: she also after she had alredie
performed the due debte of her duty to the dead body of her husband, whom
she accompayned to the grave with abundance of tears and other funeral dule,
sought not (according to the trade of young wydowes now adays left without
controlmente) to abuse the benefitte of her liberty, or dispose the time of
her widowehead in other exercise, then in augmentacion, of the patrimonye left
to her little son, and enryche her self by the travel of her own hands,
wherein she became so conetouse and gredie of gain, that cuttynge of her
idle train of loyterers (haunting commenly the houses of great men) she only
reserved such, for the necessary members of her household, as with the sweat
of their brows, refused not the toil of any honest travel, neither made she
conscience, to trade up the delicate trowpe of gentlewomen, attendinge

hand, to whom she was always a co^panio^ her self, thinking nothing so well

not only in keeping her servants to continual travail, or taking account of
their doings and days labor, but stretching further, she is enjoined
(according to thaduise of Solomon) to a straiter charge, to assiste thindeuors
of her people, with the help and diligence of her own body, seeing her
advise is no less necessary for ye perfection of the work, then her presence
and help therein a special incitacion, encoraginge the servants, not to
desiste from toil, till their task be performed, and that to thexspectacion
of her desire, neither ought any degree with be dispensed all, from honest
exercise, seeing thymitacion of travel, is deryued from our savior Christ, who
exposing his body to al toil, grudged not to undertake those painful endeavors,
which thappostells refused to endure, leaving an example to al estates, to
ymitat honest toil, (which by the mouth of thappostell he dowteth not to term
a singular virtue) promising a reward of per petuytie, with a contynuall rest
in the bosom of Abraham, to those that vnfeynedlye do follow it. But towchynge
those delicate and wanton housewiues, which think their estymacion ympaired,
if they but put their noses within the air of painful endeavor, they I say,
being hurtefull to a whole common wealth, ought either to be utterly weded
out of the company of the good sort, or else traded up in the shooles of
contynuall travel, until the fruits of the same, do adorn their estates,
which they account dymynished by thexercise of that most honest virtue,
wherein if thauncient historians and fathers of knowledge, being careful to
provoke the youth of their time to the followyng of virtue, did painte the
office and duty of a good houswife, in the person of one Lucrecia, who^ they
have neither made a bablor, or one that spendes her time in chattinge of vain
things, ronnyng to feasts and banquettes, gasinge out of the windows upon
every street walker, or masquyng in the nights with covered face, without
regard of honestye or honor of the house whereof of she came, but have drawn
her sitting in her chamber, amongst her young damesels using the spindel and
exercise of the nedell Euenso we need not, me think, doubt also to admit as
a familiar myrroir, for you coye gentlewomen of this age, our young wydowe
ZYLIA, who dividing the day into hours, and houers into mynutes, would not
suffer the least moment of time to eskape, without some exercise of
comendacion or proffitt, wherein she was so earnestly given, that the
hollydayes or seasons of solemnytie, cold not discharge her body from labor,
or make her be seen in time of recreacion either in the streets, gardynes, or
other convenient places of resort, convenient for honest assembly, to recreat
their weary bodies, and refreshe their spreetes dulled with travel.

Which virtue if it be to be honorred, for the ^arietie in our dames now a
days, yet had she another gift of no less commendacion, which she seemed not
to attain unto without the help of thegipcians theology, who resolving upon
certain honest parts, which ought to adorn the beautye of a virtuous and
chaste woman, have drawn thimage of a woman holding a keye affore her mouth,
and her feet upon a whele, notinge thereby, that an honest woman, has always
her lips locked, and her tongue tied, to thend she utter no words of vain
disposition, nor speak not but in time and place convenient, and her feet
chayned to a wheel, because they should not use their liberty, to wander as
vacabondes, no nor sturr out of the house (unless it were for religion sake,
to visit the churches or places of prayer, or now and then to render duty to
them of whom we took our being and came into this Parents.
world, wherein this wydowe exactinge upon the strait points of those
commendable customs, was not so religious as supersticious, or rather wholly
given to rigor, for she used her devotion of prayer, at such secrett times,
that it was skarce possible to see her, when she went to hear the divine
service of God, and whether it were that she thought her self so fair, that al
men wear unworthy to touch the precious brinke of her corrall mouth with a
chaste kiss, or whether the renown of her rare chastetye, made her strange in
condiscendinge to that which was tolerable and decente enough to be admitted,
yet was she such a nigarde of her courtesy, that she would make no conscience
to deny to kiss any gentleman, of what condition so ever he were, an
aunciente ciuilitye used of long time amongeste all estates, and continued to
this day (as a behavior of tolleracion, amongeste the dames of great
calling, accomptyng it a chief kind of humanity, to receive and welcome
strangers, coming to visitt them for good will, with a chaste kiss
accompanied with a countenance of semelye familiarity. But now as this wydowe
had laid her husband in his long bed of rest, there to remeine until the
general resurrection of all flesh, the dollorous disposition of her funeral
dule retired into oblivion, and she whollye given to tread the path of
painful toil, as well for the sustentation of her self and her charge, as
increase of the patrimony left to her little son, it chanced that a
gentleman of the most estimacion of that country called Monsieur Phillibarto
Virley, whose house was next neighbor to Montcall, came upon a holly day or
great feast to Montcall, and being in the church there, in place of
occupyinge his mind with heavenly cogitacions, or recordynge with attentive
ear the infallible word of God, published that day in the pulpitt, by a
preacher of the learned sort, he bestowed his devotion, in beholdynge the
glymerynge saints in the body of the church, amongeste whom his unfortunate
eyes took to large a view of the exquisitt beautye of Zilya, who having
already removed the veil of dollor, and because it was very hott, and that
she would give her self large liberty to hear the ghostly father, took
away her Eskarfyon and other implementes incident to preserve the beauty of
the face of the effeminate sort, and vnbared her cristall neck, nothing
differyng from the complexion of her face, being both dipped in the Orient
dye of the pure Allablaster, tempered with certain lively streams of redd,
like unto the incarnate rose, springing upon the brymme of the pleasante
arbor in the dewishe mornings of may, which pleasant glaunce and unhappy
encounter so daselled the eyes of the knight at the first sight, Phillyberto
falls in love with the vvydovve.
that being not hable to wythdrawe his regardes from the view of so fair a
saint, was driven at last (in making the ynner parts of his mind, a table
whereupon he drew the curious picture of her beauty) to admit thinfection
of that pleasant allurement into the bottom of his heart, wherein being once
harbored it began (according to the nature of a deadly poison) to work by
little and little, until the distillynge Iewste, dropping from the pernicious
humor of that perilous fountain, had drowned and got the dominion over the
best parts within this unfortunate patient, who even now felt such strange
alteration in himself, such new affections quarellynge with his former quiet,
and all his body possessed of so unruly a gueste, that being at the end of
his wits to ymagyn the cause, was no less hable to withstand the ill, then
moderate the fury of his new fever, but miserablye had left his life in gage,
if fortune her self, had not become ye phizicion to his disease, whereof you
shall have large relacion in the due place of this history. But duringe the
time of the sermon and all, the matutinall prayer, our unhappy Phillyberto
wa^ered in contrarietye of thoughts, reserving notwythstandyng his eyes
assuredly and firmly fixed upon her, who makes no more account of them that
regard her with such great admiration, then they them selves of their lives
and liberty, committynge rashelye two such precious Jewels, between the
merciles hands of so cruel a woman, of whose estate condition, trade, and
order of living, this new enamored Virley, (being comme from the church to
his lodging), forgatt not to make diligent inquisition, which (as oil to light
his match) returned unto him a general reaporte of her honesty, wherein
being confirmed by the mouth of every man, he made no conscience, immediatlye
to proclayme her the sovereign Lady of his life, and thonly disposer of his
secret thoughts.

And yet amongste the sondrie commendacions given to her virtues, he was made

of some his dear and familyar friends, of thinciuilitie with certain
unseemly points of unnatural discourtesie reigning in her, which albeit
suspended his: resolution for a time, occupying his doubtful mind, with
varietye of cogitacions, yet saying his destynie had alredye enjoined him to be
a thrall to her beautye, for the which he had alredye put his lybertye as a

of his durance, will not release their imprisonment, nor restore their
liberty, so sone, nor when they wish it, he determined to pursewe the end of
his enterprise, committyng him self to be guyded by the favor of fortune, and
the success of his endeavor to ye good will of love, who leadyng him through the
blind vale of vain hope, and ticklynge him by certain arguments or
likelihodes of good speed, to make him merry for the time, with the conceit of
his own fantasy, willed him to put his intent upon terms, whereby, and
with the continuance of his long service, he seemed to assure him, at last to
wreste the good will of the wydow to thappetite and exspectation of his desyer,
wherein for his first entrye into his laborinth of miserable toil, he
committed thorder of his own house at Virley, and affairs of importance to
the direction of others, and determined his abode at Montcall, to the end, that
if in pla^tyng his batterye, nor with thassistance of thuttermost of his force,
he could make no reasonable breach into the forte which he meant to assail,
in the wynnyng whereof him self was most in danger to be first taken, yet at
the least, he might recreat and solace him self, with the contemplacion of an
image of so rare and excellent beautye, the remembrance whereof, seamyng
rather to double his grief, then give moderacio^ to his passion, served more
to stir up the malice of that poisoned humor of love, then to repulse the
fury of his new fever: And lastely preferring absolute arguments of his
perentorye destruction, offered diverse likelihodes of future disquiet, for the
latter remeinder and residue of his years yet to come. And being now beco^me a
Citizen of Montcal, he began to hau^te the church above his ordinary, not so
much peradventure, for any fervent zeal he had to prayer or invocation to god,
as for the amarus deuocio^ he ought to his new saint, whose presence, albeit
he could not enjoy, but in the body of ye church, and that in times of
preaching and public service of the Lord, yet did he refrain to make the
house of God, a place to communicate his practis of love, persuading him self,
thoffence to be to heinous to defile the sacred temples and holly places,
dedicated to the highest, with any spot of villainy, and specially with
attemptes of such folly, being chieflye forbidden by the mouth of our savior,
Domus mea, domus orationis vocabitur, my house shall be called the house of
prayer, and not a den for adulterers or thieves, nor place to practice any
iniquity or sin, wherein albeit the zeal of Religion forbadd him to use
conference with her in the church, yet the pearcing stinge of affection,
openyng him an other mean, putt him in remembrance to attend duelye her
coming out, where, with great humilitye he offered his service often time in
being her guide to her lodgyng, which as he forgot not to perform, with all
the courtesy and semly behauior he cold ymagyn, so notwithstanding all the
vehement perswacions he cold infer for thacco^mplishment of his desire, yet
reaped he thereby no more contentemente nor means to qualefie his greeffe,
then she took pleasure in hearing the discourse and loyal offer of his
unfeigned good will, for she, as a cruel enemy to courtesy, faynyng not to
understand what he said, replied to all his allegacions of love, with some
conference of housewiuerye or housekepyng, wherewith, tornyng the carte against
the horse, he became no less amassed at her overthwart reasons, then she seamed
to take pleasure in the tears of his complayntes, which argewed not only
cold compforte in the suit of the wooer, but also ymynent occasion of his own
destruction, if by thassistance of some other mean, he avoided not with
expedicion, the sondrie illes that threatened to thunder upon him, wherefore
devising certeinne banquettes and gossep metynges at his lodging, of diverse of
the burgess wives of that town, he entered thereby into the good opynion of
certain dames, that were no less familiar with the rigerous ZILYA, amongst
whom he chused out one whose bossome he thought to make the regester of his
secret, with entente to impart with her, both the cause of his dollor, and the
mean to mitigate the same in bewrayinge his greeffe to her, that was the
fountain and occasion of his present passion: to her then (being his next
neyghbor) no less subtle of her own inclynacion, then well experienced in
such affairs, neither ignorante what dishe they feed upon that sit at the
table of love, nor what bitter taste those brathes commonly have which cupide
brueth for his guests, he addresseth him self, coniunynge her in the first
place of his preamble, too make council of the cause of his co^plainte, wherwt
entering into the discourse of his love, conceiles nowithstandyng the name of
his lady, until he hard the annswere of his neighbor, who perceiving
alredie the mark which he shot at, offered him frankelie her help, to
thuttermoste of her power, whereof she gave him assurance by promises of large
skope, that inconsideracion of the honesty, which she had noted in him
hitherunto, she would not fail to bestow her endeavor every way, to
thaduancement of his desire, wherein (sir) says she, although my offer seame
more liberal on your behalf then your meaning plain unto me, yet I hope you
will conster my words to an honest end, and not abuse the readynes of my
inclinacion to do you good in any travel of reasonable consequence, where in
it shall please you to employ me, to whom this careful knight, after he had
given her ye choice of a thousand thanks, and persuaded her eftesones to a

the pollitike captain, who going about to give thassalte to a fortress or
place of defense, being careful to keep his soldiers from slaughter or the
^ochers ^owle, planteth his ordinance and battery in the face of the forte, to
the end that the place being made assaltable by the help of the Cannon, the
soldiers may more saffelie give charge upon the walls, and perform the
exspectation of their capteyne, euenso, for my part, having drawn a great
deal of time to end in the long siege of a forte, no less strong, then the
stonnye rock, whose hardness resistyng the force of all shot, makes also like
account of the valiante courage of my soldiers, whereof I have alredye lost
the greatest number, in diverse skirmishes given me by my pleasante enemy, am

to the end that with thassistance of your council and travail, I may be hable
to make an approach, and enter the place which hetherunto has repulsed all

have I much been traded in the exercise of war, or acquainted with the use of

in few words, that the laborinth of that war, which he mente, was no less
natural then common, neither doubt I (says he) but some time in your life,

canuisadees the trenche may be soddainly invaded, what secrett ambushes may
be laid, to vanquishe force by pollecie, and what means are to be used every
way, as well by thassailant as defendante.

Whereunto she answered with a semblable similitude, derived The answer of
his neighbor.
of the like occasion chieflye to encorage this fainte soldiers to continue
his new war, saying, that as far as she could discern, there lacked nothing
but thassurance of the field, saying (says she with a familiar show of
pleasante cheer) we are alredye in point to enter the combat, and albeit all
your pollecie, in deuisinge bulwarks, square and round, mountes of great
heighte and well rampired, are not hable to batter the place, and the subtle
mines under the earth, and other mertiall engines lack force against the
strength of the ennemy, nor in no sort to favor your enterprise, nor your
tre^nches artificially made, pricked full of perilous flankars, are hable to
amase the captain of the forte, no nor the sundry terrible assaults given by
your desperate soldiors, will procure either parley or composition, yet (says
this merry dame,) let us not reward our long war with a short shame, nor
sell the glory of so great a victory for so vile a price, as faintnes of
courage, but let us eftesones renew the conflicte with fresh supplies, and
send to somon the forte by the mouth of the Canon, whose message I warrant
you, the captain will not deny.

Albeit because in plainlye understanding your intent, I may frankely
imploye my endeavor, I pray you dismiss thies dark Apothegmaes of war, and
open your meaning simply, for I grieve on your behalf, to see you converted
into such alteracion, which makes you seem utterly to degenerate from your
ancient modesty and wisdom, whereof he desiered her not to merueile, seeing
that according to the dispocition of the accidente, the condition and state of
men do commonly change and alter, for I am become (says he) subject and
bownde to one that has made me in none other taking, then those vnhapie
wretches that be tormented with deuiles, who as they can neither say, nor do
any thing, but by the permision of the sprite that possesses them, Euenso,
this cursed enchaunter love has got such power over all the parts in me,
that he alone commaundes me by power and authority, and I obey by awe and
fear, he enioynes me penance at his pleasure, and I endure the pain and dare
not complain, he alas promised me contentmente, and now pays me with doble
annoye, he offered to assiste me, and leaves me in thextremetye of my distress,
yea in place where I ought to use arguments of most audacitie, it is there
that he depriues me of all courage, and leaves me without countenance, and
being alone (god knowith) how valyantly I invade the place, which I darr
skarcely behold with open eye, when mine enemy is in presence, is it not pity
alas to see on manne distressed with so many diuerseties at one instante,
procedynge only of the ragyng appetit of one simple affection? neither would I
grudge at the heavy burden of thyes passions, nor stick to endure a thousand
more euilles, if either sufferance would make my service acceptable, or time
purchase the merit of my martyrdom? but where as there appears nothing but
uncertainty, with arguments every way of evil success, and I in the mean
time according to the CAMELEON living with the breathe of the air, do feed
but upon the offer of vain ymaginacions, what is there to keep me out of
the danger of despair, saving that thunfortunate sort, are content to
ymparte (toward the moderacion of my grief) some of their solace, which is
to feed for the time, upon the pleasante conceit of phantasye, and
flickeringe offers of vain hope, attendinge that some good god, will lay in
my lapp thassistance of a loyal friend, that will either shot the gates of
this hell against me, or at least procure the spedie dispense of my tormente,
by cloasing my eyes from the light of this world, which I wish with no less
faruent affection, then the sickeman desiereth with ymportunitie to be
dispatched of his pain, which he accompanied with such a dollerus peale of
lighes, that his stomach and heart, being ready to take their leave of the
breath of life, seamed to pant like a pair of bellows, blowinge the fournace
of some fyerie forge, neither forgot his eyes to set open the windows of their
conduites, and gushe out a whole river of tears, which being drayned from
the bottom of his belly, ascended to the uppermost parts to find out their
natural issue, to the end that with the retire of these drayninge humors, his
life might also vanishe, as in a slomber or quiet qualme which moved such a
pity in his neighbor on the behalf of his dollor, that she was forced to
keep him company with semblable kindness, offeringe eftsoon her help under
these terms:

Albeit (says she) the regard of mine honesty, with thestimacion of the
place which I hold without blushinge amongst His neighbor makes, a second
offer of her help.
the troops of honor, and dames of great calling in this City, do forbidd me
the enterprise of any thing that mine honor can not bro^^e, yet the sorowefull
sommonce of your last complainte, tempred with so many tunes of doleful note,
has filled me so full of compassion on your behalf, that I will not dowt to
lay my conscience to gage, for the redress of your present affliction,
wherein if you will give me the charge of my commission, tellinge me what it
is that I shall do for you, you shall see my endeavor shall be no less frankelye
employed for you, then I know by the view of mine own eyes, that your
passion is simple and without all dissimulation: only there restes that I
know, what she is to whom you have auowed so large a devotion, for I promise
you, to salute her so amply with the reaport of your loyalty and service,
which I know you owe to her that is the mistres of your heart, that oneles
her mouth be utterly out of taste, and thappetit of courtesy clean taken from
her, she shall not refuce thoffer of your good will, which I think is without a
second in any place of the world.

And truly albeit diverse women now a days, have good cause to inueighe by
complaints against the disloyaltye of men, yet this Lady whom you seem to
honor so much, has neither cause to mislike her choice, nor reason to
refuce the consent and offer of your service, where of as the earth semes a
very nigarde, to bring furthe and norishe so few of your disposition, so it
can not be chosen, but pure loyaltye for lack of harbor within the hearts of
most men, must retire and seek her a new habitacion, within the delicate
intrailes of us women, who embracing no less that virtue with dear
affection, then desyerous to expose unfeigned fruits of the same, are accounted
to be cladde in the habit of cruelty, if we seem to stand upon our guard,
and expulse thassaulte, of that friuolus and fleshelye crewe of vain lovers,
who profferinge their service under a masque of feigned tears, and sighs of
double deceit, with other courtelyke importunytyes, do bend the pollecie of
all their practices to none other end, then to abuse the favor which they
find at their hands, that vnhappelye commit their honor to the kepinge of
those Sycophantes, and common enemies to the renown of all Ladies. Ah good
madam (says he) although my little hablenes denies me sufficient means, to
measure the reward of your frank offer, according to the meritt of your
great courtesy, yet behold hear a soldiour and gentleman bound to be no
less prodigal of his life, and spend the deareste dropp of his blodd in your
service, then you seem liberal of your estimation for the appeasyng of his
greff: and seeing your promise is so far past, by words of confirmation, to
do your best for me, as the same ymportes an assured hope of spedie help to
comme by our means, the chiefest thing that I committ to your frendshipp, is
to deliver a letter from me, to Madame ZYLIA, whose beauty has alredye made
such a breach into my heart, and brued the broth of the tormente, which you
see I suffer, that onelesse I be spedie releued, I do not se but that ye three
fattals, weary with drawing furthe the spindell of my lif, will ymediatly cut
a sonder ye twiste, which hanges only, by the hope of your succors, in
purchasyng me favor with her, that has made me captiff in the prison of her
commandment: wherewith the faithful burgoise, being very sorry, that so
honest a gentleman, had sown the seeds of his good will, in a soil of so
bad increase bringing forth but fruits of cruelty, assaied to take the worm
out of his nose, in using perswacions to remove his pha^tasie, but he that was
alredie resolved in his mishap, detested all council, and shoot his ears
from the wholesome advise of the wise matrone, who doutyng that he would conster
her words contrary to her meaning, in thinkinge that she inferred
exhortacions to purchase a releace of her promise, willed him to write his
letter, and she would not only deliver it, but also bring him a reaporte of
that which should be sent him for answer, whereby (says she) you shall see
the little gain and less easse, that will follow the meritt of your painful
travel, ymployed in the service of so unthankful a woman, with whom seeing I
am thorowely acquainted, and her disposicion no stranger unto me, I mean not
to pra^ise in any other sort, then to discharge ye part of a messe^ger, in
delivering your letter, which if you have not alredie made, I will attend your
leisure, to thend to perform my promise, wherewith he thanked her as
apperteined, and beynd alone in his chamber, sommoned all his wits together,
to devise his letter, which seemed to be written in thies or like term.

If my disease (good madame) were deryued either of the shaking or burning
fever, Catterres, Apoplexies or any other Philliberto vvriteth to his Lady
hurtefull influence, incidente commonly to annoye the parts of man's body,
I would reasorte too the council of Physic, and use the discipline of
wholesome dyot, but where my present passion procedes only of the feruente
affection I bear you: thextremitie of the same denies also to be cured by any
other remedy, then the happy encounter of that which is thoriginall cause of
my greeff, wherein albeit I half assure my self rather to receive spedie ease,
and end of my tormente, by the fatal domme of death, then abridgment of my
dollors, or consolacion in my distress, by any endeavor or affection
reciprocal of you, yet am I so lynked in the laborinth of love, that I am
denied every way, to take truce with my unruly desiers, and less hable of my
self, to revoke the vow of my unfeigned devotion, to your rare and heauenle
beauty, in whom consistes, the propper Cataplasma of my disease Alas under
what crabbed constellacion was I conceived, or what cruel destenye directes
the course of my years, seeing that in the glory of my youth, and pryme time
of mine age, I am at one instante, threatened of the heavens, made subject to
the malice of love, and ready to incurr the perilus danger of despair, for
want of hope to draw furthe the length of my days, to thuttermost date of my
life, which I think was formed first by nature, and continued hitherunto by
consent of the gods, to spend the future remeynder of my time, only in
the service of you (good madame) to whom herewith, as the first fruits of my
humble and dear zeal toward you, I make a present of my poor afflicted
heart, which as it is sustained, by the only view and remembrance of your
beauty and virtue, So being denied harbor at your hands, his next and last
refuge is, to exspecte consolacion in death, which hitherunto I have refused,
and for ye present do shonne, not for any horror or fear I conceive of his
malice, but only to prolonge yet the course of my life, to the end that as
my mind has alredye vowed to serve you. So my body as a necessary
instrumente, may be whollye ymployed to the execution of your commandments:
But if the dedication of mine offer, shall receive an unthankful repulse, or
the merit of my affectioned service, sent hacke, with a paymente of cruelty
(a vice not like to inhabit where nature and the gods, have disposed, so
plentifullye all their gifts of grace, nor incident commonly to creatures of
so vertuoule norriture and good bringynge up) you shall see me immediatlye
suffer, that which I have not deserved, and you I know will be sorry for the
thing, which you can not amend, wherefore seeing you have the choice, both to
prolonge my lif with double joy, and abridge my days by undeserved dollor,
embrace the works of compassion. the chief branches of virtue, and refuce
the surname of crueltye, wherein I prefer eftesones this last importunitye, to
the end, that if my request be barred, to enter the gates of pitye, with you,
you may at least give death his dispatche (who attendes upon the reaporte of
your answer, to execute his charge upon him, who wishes you, that which
you hate, and sendes you that which he loves. Yours more then his own. P.
Virley.

This letter sealed and subscribed with his own hand, he delivered, not
without abundance of tears, to his neighbor, who promisinge him once again,
to bring him answer before she slepte, went her way, leaving the
languishynge knight, buildyng castles in the air, with a thousand hammors in
his head, and tickling him self to make himself laughe, seemed sometime to
bathe his sorrows, in the joy and co^tentement which vain hope offered him by
visions in his flatteringe conceit, but when the loathsome image of the cruel
inciuilitye of Zilya, presented her self in his mind, his pleasure retired
into dule, with as many arguments of present death, as earste he ymagined
liklihodes of contentement and joy, semynge to have in his eye, the angry and
frownyng looks, wherewith his mistres received the coming of the messenger,
who arrived now at the pallaice of Zilya, met her coming out of a gardyne on
the back side of her house, where having saluted each other, with equal
show of curtesye, the Lady messenger thinking to prefer certain excuses
as well to avoid imputation, which might be objected against her unseemly
execution of so badd an embassage, as also to infer perswacions on the behalf
of him, by whom she was sent, was prevented by the wydowe, who told her,
that she merueilled to see her there at that hour, considering her former
conversation, which has always argued her, to be so friendly to virtue and
enemy to exercise of idleness, that she would not let slipp one mynute of
time, without it were frutefullye ymployed, whereunto the burgess replied with
thanks, for the goood opinion she seamed to have of her and her doings, with
desyer to persevere therein, til just occasion deserved the contrary

And touching my being here at this hour (says she) which The messenger to
the vvy dovve.
you seame to term an idle vacacion, if my message might be hard and
considered with no less indifferency of you, then the cause of my coming
importes great and unfeigned necessitye, you would (I am sewer) convert that
conceit into an opinyon of virtuous inclination in me, for I am persuaded
that the time ymployed in works of pitye, and releuyng the afflicted and
dollorous company, distressed with dule, is as well spente, and no less
meritorious before God, then those momentes and seasons, joined to the
contynuall yoke of exstreme labor and toil of the hands, whereof I would
presentlye, present you a particular discourse, if the reaporte of my
embassage would not be hurtefull to the league of amytie, long ago practiced
between us: Whereunto the curious wydowe (having alredye kindled in her heart
the coals of disdain) answered with a countinance, derived of the angry
disposition of her mallencolike mind, that touching the reaporte, she should
be as wearye with hearing the circumstance, as unwilling to consider of the
case. And albeit (says she) I know not the intent of your words, and much
less the cause of your coming, yet the kallendor of my mind pronosticates
the effect of your embassage, to importe requests of other consequence, then
mine honor will be hable to brook, wherefore I pray you let me be deceived in
mine exspectation, and you so curious to keep the league of our ancient
frendshipp, that the breathe of your own mouth do not dissolve that, which
erst seamed indissoluble, nor you become the messenger of reaportes that any
way, may seem indecent for a dame of your degree.

Madame says the messenger, the little Simpathia and equality of affection,
which seames to be in you, in comparison of the virtues of him whose solicitor
I am, has moved I think this passion in you, notwithstanding for my part,
being no less sorry for the present affliction of Monsieur de Virley, then
desierous to releue his distress with thuttermoste of my endeavor, I have
undertaken the charge of a messenger, to deliver this letter (which then she
takes out of her pocket and gives to Zilya) unto you, wherein as my faith
lies in pawn, for the performance of my promise, so I beseech you, on his
behalf, refuce not his present, accompanied with a frank offer of his humble
service, life, living and all that he has, to be employed only at the beck
of your commandment, wherein, if amongeste the other beatitudes or virtues
given us, by special name in the scripture, the acts of charity, with
endeavor to succor the afflicted, and give consolation to the comfortles, be no
less acceptable before God then the rest, refuce not madame, to releue him,
who for your sake, has lost his liberty, languisheth in continual dollor,
and is redye for want of relief at your hand, to take his leave of us
wretches in this world, with which just incitacions to compassion, I join
also this request of mine, that if the deserte of my frendshypp, may find
place of favor in you, you will, (the rather for my sake, open and read the
letter, retournynge your annswere by me, who has undertaken no further but the
delivery of the same, and reaporte your resolucion touching the contents of
his demand. Zilya, besides the crabbed inclination of her own nature, being
not acquainted with such kind of embassages, and less wont to be courted
with requests of the like courtesy, began here to enter into such a
disposicion of collor, that at the first, she was ready to wreake her malice
upon the letter, committynge it into a thousand pieces, and return the
messenger without any answer, albeit reserving by chance some spark of
modesty, which ought to be incidente to all women, she opened and redds the
contents of her clyante, not without signs of great alteracion in her face,
arguing lyuelye enoughe the contrariety of thoughts, which seemed to quarrel
in her mind: for within less then a moment of time, she changed coolor twize
or thrice, some time pale like the cross of Dyana, which being set against
the son, loaseth by and by the glory of his borrowed light, and returned
immediately to a crymsyne, not much unlike the florishinge dye of the fragrante
rose, glisterynge in his orient coolour in the pleasant mournynges of the
spring, notwithstanding having redd and over red with thies alterations, the
some of his demand, being not hable any longer to conceile or moderate, the
passion of her ire, clawed her neighbor with this crabbed answer. I would
never have thought, that Zilia answers the messenger.
under the outward show of your virtuous conversation, whereof you have been
no less noted, then commended by the mouth of all men hetherunto, had lorked
such foul fruits, of abominable substance, and specially in a desire, to
become a celecarier of letters in the favor of love, wherein as you have seemed
to waighe the reputacion of your self, and the renown of mine honor, in
thindifferente balance of your own light judgment, Euenso, if the law of
friend ship did not stopp my mouth, and make me dissymule, that which I
think, or if any other had been the messenger of thies affairs, I assure you,
the publicacion of the fact, should have made her honor, no less notorius
and subject to perpetual infamye hereafter, then I seem to make dear
account of my chastetie, which I would you should know, is armed with more
assurance, then to be shaken with any assaltes of thies follies: wherefore if
you be as careful to live in quiett without skandall hereafter, as I am
absolutely resolved not to dimynish the title of my honor, by any act of mine
own, let this first falte diswade you, to wade any further in an enterprise
of so small commendacions, seeing that she that is either mynister or messenger
in these amarouse trafficques, or a furtheror of such practices of love, is no
less guilty affore God and her conscience, then if she were either pillowe or
bolster to the detestable fact.

And for mine answer to Siegneur de Virley, whose demand I deteste, no less
then his folly deserves, if he have opened his ear to thinchauntment of love,
let him expulse thennemye with a countercharme, by raison, or else make the
best of his own bargain, for seeing his disease commes of him self, let him
exspecte no consolacion at my hand, for I had rather be a friend to death,
then favor the least iotte of his demand, wherein for a confirmacion of my
resolucion, I intend hensfurthe to bar him al means of access to my
presence, wherewith on my behalf you may salute him.

The lady messenger, seeing her self in this sort clawed, where it itched not,
and no less ashamed of her sharp repulse, then sorry yt her medicine, was of
no better operacion, on the behalf of her patient, semynge notwithstanding to
be little moved with the angry complexion of ZYLIA, desiered that God would
reduce the difference and inequality of their diseases, into a Sympathia and
equality of passion, I mean, says she madame that you may be taken out of
this conceit of cruel disdain, which makes you incapable of reason, and he
restored to his liberty, which he can not redeem, but by thastistance of your
goodness, wherewith she took a short leave and departed, and being arrived at
the lodging of her knighte, she found him all plunged in extreme dollour, upon
a field bed, with more arguments of death, then likelihods of life, who,
whether he felt some signs of ill luck by the secrett instigation of his
heart (which commonly preferres diverse conceits of fear, when the mind is
occupied with dowte) or whether the sorowefull countenance of the messenger did
signefie her ill success in his suit, or what it was, I can not tell, but as
his neighbor was entringe into the report of her answer, he stopped her
mouth, and prevented her meaning with this exclamacion The complaint of
Seigneur Philiberto.
followyng. What state is more wretched, then he, that lives dowtefull of
himself with despair of dispense from disquiett, by any assistaunce of time
or other mediator on his behalf, who is wrapte in such misery, or has more
cause to complain, then he to whom fortune has vowed a contynua^ce of her
malice, without hope to reclaim her favor? is there any penance greater, then
to be pun^shed with continual passion, or plage of more mortality, then to
consume by pecemeale in ye flame of languishyng dule? Ah infortunat gentleman,
how vnhappelie art thou fallen from the felicity of a life full of pleasant
liberty, with exchaung of thine ancient bliss, for a tribute of torments,
more supportable then death, how happy and thrysblissed was thy estate,
enjoying the sweet maydenhedd of thy affection, and use of fredome, without
awe or controlement of any? where now (alas) the touch of a contrary
experience, yeldes me the effect of a thousand deaths, without license
notwithstanding to dye, whereby I should dismiss every plage that staieth
the fattall desyer of my dyeng heart, wherein has fortune this cause of
displeasure against me, if not that she is disdainefull of the quiett which
we wretches find upon earth and such an enemy to the common contentement
of us all, that only to manifest her power amongeste us she, upon a soddaynes
choke our pleasant thirst and desyer of free life with, pills of passions
and annoyes of more bitter taste, then any gall tempered with the most strong
ruberbe, that ever came out of Alaxandria, comittinge us in the end to a
martyrdom of more extremetie, then the pange appointed by death, to break in
pieces the force and strength of the heart? whereof who is a more familiar
experience, then the miserable Philiberto, who in exchange of his former
quiett and contentement of will, has coughte alas a captivity more cruel,
then he that is condemned to end his days in the bottom of a dongeon. Ah
madame, how your countenance argues the small regard which Zylia has of my
pain? full well do I see alas, that she neither maks account of my letters,
nor uses pity to my distress, and much less gives any creditt at all to
your honest frendeshipp, which I confess I have greatelye abused, in
procuring you displeasure, for the ease of my disquiett? let love bear the
blame, and I the just penance of mine own indiscrecion that so rashely have
entered the sea of my own sorrow, and saw at setting from the shore,
sufficyent arguments of mortal evils, threatenynge my present peril, wherein
albeit I was flattered at the first with a calm and pleasant ebb, which made
my hoyse sail and floate without any fear, yet in the veraye inconstancy
which all men attributes to that element, and unruly waves raging without
measure in the heighte of that trobled sea, appeared plainly enoughe, the
likelehodes of my present danger, which I would had power to destrdye me
by some soddaine shypwrake, or cast me spedelye into the bottomless golphe to
be deuowred in the throat of some monster in the merciles occean Ah Love, with
what justice cold I exclaim against thy infydelitie, for that thou have
always flattered me, with an assurance of that which now I find furthest
from me? haste thou a pollecie to persuade a creadit in that wherein thou
meanest absolute deceit, and then to triumph in the thraldom of such as
believe thy charms? if this be thy order of dealinge, why bear thou the
title of a necessary virtue, or ympartest thine authority with the powers
above? for my part, if there were cause of hope, or exspectacion of delivery,
I cold in some sort qualefye the rage of my present annoye, with imaginacio^
of future redress, or if the contynuance of my greeffe argued a lykelehodd of
contentement hereafter, the remembrance of my felycitie to come, would
mortefye the panges which now I am forced to feel without releace of pain?
but alas too what end do I ymagyne a composicion with him, that is Love not
seuiahle to any order.
not leuyable to any order, and much less partaker of the nobled virtue or
gift of piti? why do I plead for grace in a court of common cruelty where
tyranny shootes the gates of compassion against complaints of justice? or to
what end should I expect so much as a simple offer of help in him, who is borne
the common enemy and destruction of many? is there exspectacion of remedy in
him, whose breath is a poiso^ more infectiue, then any venym that earste has
been made by the moest conning enchauntor that ever was bred in the myerye
vale? or is there reason to depend upon the delyuery of him, who lies in
ambushe to assalte me in worse sort, then yet I have felt? Ah cruel mistrys,
full evil do you measure the circunstance and effect of my goodwill, with
protestacion of vow never to depart out of the lease of your commandementes?
fewer if your waspish mind would confirm and make good the consent of your
beauty, or that your inward parts would give leave to thoutewarde arguments
to work an effect of that which they promysse by show, I should not have
cause to lament such lack in you and much less endure this extremetye by
hoping for that which I know I shall never have? Oh could recompense and
unthankful return of the loyal zeal I have borne without spotte of
dishonest intent in any sortt: A^ serpent and masqued basylyke in whom is
rather a feigned show, then true effect of any curtesye, the only glaunces of
thine eyes have had power to fill every corner of my heart full of poisoned
infection, wherein at least if I hadd thassistance of any art or droague to
remove thy forces, I should be restored to mine aunciente quiet, and thou live
at rest without the noise of so many ymportunities. And now do I see an
experience of ancient opynion touching the malady of love, who is neither
healed by salve, nor cured by art: for to make insicion to the sore, would
give but increase to my pain, and to use thapplicacion of medicines, were but to
feed the time with incertenties, and to stay the humor, were enoughe to give
end to my life, by present suff^cacion, so that alas I see no choice of
remedy, then to be touched with the hand that first gave vent and set
abroach the cause of the wound, that I wish (in full satisfaction of al my
torment) that she might see the very depth and furthest part of my heart, to
the nde she might be judge of my loyalty, and acknowledge the wrong she
does to the virtue of my honest meaning. But alas, I find herein that my
destynies contend against my desyer, and the view of her former cruelty,
makes me despair of other favor, then such as hitherunto I have found, so
that as I wholly depend upon her goodness, and my life paiseth only in the
balance of her good will, so I know she is fully desolued in a contrary
disposicion against me, making a Jest of my humble suit and offer of service,
takes pleasure in my martirdom, and reapose a special felycitie in the points
of my peculiar and mortal grief, which he ended not without such abundance
of tears, and supply of other sorrow, that the messenger was forced to abandon
the place, and leave him in the midst of his passion, ymparting
notwithstanding, the points of her answer to a dear friend of the knighte,
with advise to supplante his affection, or else seek his remedy by some other
means, wherein albeit he performed thindeuor of a friend every way, yet the
success argued a small virtue in his diligence and the patient rather resolved
in extremeties, the hable to admit any thing which ymported a moderacion to
his grief, the which greew ymediatlie to such extreme terms, that the
strength and desyer of the stomach was converted ymediatlie into a contempt of
necessary sustentacion, and in place of sleep he embraced the offer of vain
conceits, appearinge (as it were) by visyon through the mystery of hollow
dreams, refusinge conference with all men, if not, that sometime he would
complain upon the cruelty of one whom he would not name, with desyer to end
his life in the pursewte of that quarrel. The phizicions were found at the end
of their wits, both unable to discern the cause of his disease, and without
s^il to give a remedy to his evil, what inspection soever they made in his
vryne or tryeng of his pulses, or other signs to judge his greeffe or any
authorytye of their art, whereupon the gentleman his companion entered into
such terms of sorrow for the sickness of his friend, that his dollor seamed of
equal qualytie to the passion of his companion, not ceassing notwithstanding
to solicit the goodwil of Zilya, by his own travel, and letters, which put
her in remembrance of the pytie that women ought to use to thafflicted,
presents and promises of no small price with other devises wherein he judged any
virtue to move her haggarde disposicion, and for that he saw that in the very
view of her presence, consisted the recovery of his friend, he forgot not to
entreat her with terms due as he had sewed to the greatest princess of Spain
or Italye, wherein, notwythstandynge he gained as much as if he had undertaken
to number the stars, or stay yt course of the son, for that she excused her
self upon her wydo wheade, and how evil it became a gentlewoman of her
estate and calling, to commit her honor to dowte, and honest name to question,
in visiting the sickness of one who is neither parent nor allye, nor almost any
way known unto her, which as it drive him from further attempt that way,
so waighinge the distres of his trend, and ye virtue which nature has given to
onewoma^ to entreat an other, thought it a piece of pollecie to give a second
charge of her, who first broached his request to his cruel mistrys, to whom he
preferred such reasons as he accounted of force to persuade her, sometime
alledginge the pytie which naturally is incydent to all women, and when, and
upon whom it ought to be exposed, he preferred also the glory with names of
ymmortalytie which diverse of foreign time have won by semblable virtue, where
with he won a second grant of her furtherance, so far forth as at thinstant
they went together to the lodginge of Seignenr Virley in whom the very view of
his aunciente friend and next neighbor sturred up a more increase of sorrow,
forcinge him to a further complaint then affore with desyer chiefly, that he
had never made exsperience of her faith nor she cause to attempt the
frendshipp of her, whose cruelty in preseruinge her honor, is greater then is
necessary, and compassion less then is convenient for his distress,
proceeding only of an honest zeal without intent of violacion of honor or
honest name: which with diverse argumentts of ghastelye regard, accompanienge
his last words, wrought such effects of pytie and remorse in the honest
matrone his neighbor, that to prevent his further danger, she gave him
assurance of her uttermost, in boarding eftso^es the goodwil of his ^oye
mistrys with protestacion of waranty, that if he were delivered of his sickness,
she would procure a mutual conference between him, and the cause of his unjust
torment, whereunto albeit he gave little credit, for that he thought it was but a
broth brued of artifyciall liccour to feed him with dropps of uncertain
consolacion, yet in the very offer of her friendship appeared a ho^e of spedie
delivery which she promised eftsoon in sort as you have hard, willinge him to
reapose himself wholly in the virtue of her endeavor and word, which seamed
to breath an air of such compfort and force through all his parts, that
defyenge the malice of his late sickness, he seamed even then to lack no part
of his former health, neither had he need of restoretiues or force of
confections to confirm his recouerye, or assistance of staff or crooche, to
supporte his feeble lymmes weakened with so long sickness, but perswadinge a
wounderfull felicyty in the very remembrance which his mistrys seamed to have
of his distress, he ymagyned to sit alredie in the paradise of his pleasure
dismissinge ymediatly the messenger, who careful for her part to put her
promise in use attended thoffer of convenient time to work theffect
accordingly, wherein she was assisted with a special favor of fortune, who for
the more expedicion of ye matter, brought Zylya and the lady messenger to mete
wtin iij. days after) in one pew or cloase deske in ye church, where ye
solicitor of Seigueur Virley forcing certain tears in her eyes, began to
practice for her clyent in such sort yt what with repeticion of the passion of
the knighte, special reproach against the cruelty of women in those cases,
with general come^dacion to ye virtue of such as declare compassion upon the
distress of thafflicted, she wrought her to a remorse of his pain, with
consent to preuente his further peril, with a simple offer of the view of her
presence, and that under terms of condition, that from and after the time of
such frendshipp he should disclayme al ymportunities in the pursuit of further
favor, wherewyth she enjoined him only a liberty of an hours conference the
next day at ij of the clock in thafter none, where (says she) I have more
regard to thextremetie of his distress with desyer to stop the course of
further danger in him, then to give him any cause at al to make his proffit of
this frendeshippe or persuade a hope of further favor in me hereafter, prayinge
you for your part, to give him in strait charge, neither to break the moment
of appointmente, nor excede the lymyt of his time, wherein as I reappose a
chief credit in your honesty, so if the success answer not my
exspectacion, assure your self, your virtue cann not escape with out
slander, and the best part of your faith remeyne in question for ever:
wherewyth they departed the one to her lodging converted whollly into devise
with what terms she should answer the day followinge the folly of her
folishe lover, the other repaireth to her passioned Vyrle who dispairinge still
of the goodness of Zylya, prevented the reaporte of the messenger by askinge her

aunciente tyranny or no, that you shall try your self (says she) if you have
the heart to meet her tomorowe in her house at the second hour after dynner

desperate parts, that he feell of embrasing the bringer of those glade; some
news offringe her the choice of a thousand thanks, with liberty to dispose
of him and all that was his at her pleasure, thinking the exposicion of his
life to a thousand perils for her sake, was far insufficiente to counteruaile
the greatness of the pleasure, she had procured him in that simple
appointmente, which he promised to perform the next day according to the
hour, with intent to endure what soever it pleased fortune to bestow upon
him, against whom to strive (says he, albeit is as though a man should make
war against himself, whereof the victory cannot be without doble danger,

without that he had liberty to give judgment of the malice of a woman, when
she is disposed to spyt out the vttermoste stynge of her venym. And sewerly

enchauntement, procedyng of the beauty of women, both pleasant and hurtefull
to men, seames too be typped with a certain virtue of delight, drawing the
fondlinges of the world to be in love with the cause of their own
destruction, So I am of oppinon also that yt is a kind of punisheme^t which
God has appointed to plage and torment us for our offenses that way, seeing,
that the most of us (now a days) syppynge of the cupp of that infection, do
convert the remembrance and care which we ought to have of thestimacion of
virtue, into a special affection toward our fond fancies, seekinge our
felicity and quiet in the tomb wherein is shrouded the topp and root of all
our my shapps. Besides virtuous and chaste Ladies, are not so simple, nor
void of discrecion, but they behold affarr of and are pryuye to the meaning

of feigned virtue, not doutynge also that such masqued lovers disfer nothing
from the venomous skorpion, whose poison lies altogether in her tail, for
that the end of such love argues a subuercion of the renown and former
virtues of a man, which of falls out rightly in ye sequeile of this Virey,
who thinking to have made a great conquest, in the victory of free conference
with his unkind mistrys, is now upon the way to her pallais (or rather
pathe of his own misfortune) with more contentement I am sewer, then hertofore
he has received disquiett by his former torment: And being now in the base
court of herl odgyng, he found her in a low hal attended upon with one
gentlewoman only, where after certain cold gretinges, entermedled with a
countenance of counterfaite joy on her part, she slented at his sickness with
thies terms. if every evil were as mortal in deed, as yt is made by
reapport, a sleighte salve cold not so soon cure so great disease, nor
unproven medecins work such marvelous operacions, in so short a time,
specially upon so dangerous a greeff, as yours (Seigneur Virley) seamed to
be by the reaport of al men unto me, which shall serve me, as an undoubted
experience hereafter, that the passions of men be of no longer aboade, then
the subject of their affection appears before their eyes, neither be they
other things then certain mirroiers or lookinge glasses, wherein albeyt are
represented the very licknes or figure of theime that behold theime, yet
taking away the object or cause, and the form vanishes also as the poff of
wind passinge along the strait of a plain or deep valleye. Ah madame (says
he) how easy yt is to devise of my disease, and hard for me to hope for
remedy at your hand, that doutes of the greatness of my passion, and easlye
may he prefer either mirth or sorrow at his pleasure whose mind is free from
conceits of dout or despair: where theharte truly passioned, dreades to make
declaracion of either of them, least in excedyng in the one, or seaminge to
much a nigard of the other. the show of either of them bring his suit or
honest intent in I^lewse suspicion with them, in whom only rests the
Cataplama of his sore, so that I account him now the most infortunat man,
whose state is vnhapelye brought under the awe of such two mortal
extremeties: and for my part, if I were as free from thextreame points of
affection, as you seame far from reason to doubt of the greatness of my
greeff, I could (with better will) allow your discreditt in the faith and
inconstancye of men: but alas he that is caughte with the snares of true
love, can behold no other figure, nor make other liknes then of the true
cause of his affection, the picture whereof remeyneth for ever within the
sewrest part of the heart, which in deed (as you say is the true mirroer,
wherein appears not a feigned shadow, fadyng with the form, but a contynuall
view and remembrance of her, by whom we live in such heavenly contemplacio^
in which dyol or lokyng glass I have ympryn ted ye true effect of the thing
(which by virtue ofdue meritt) ought to restore strength to my present weakness,
dealing so extremely with me, from the first time of this contemplacion. that
thonly offer of hope to restore in the end my dekayed parts, has hetherunto
prevented theffect of utter destruction to every piece and member of my body.
And touching thargumentes of health which you note in me, I am to yield you
alone all homage and honor for the same, for that the favor which I find in
this present appointement and conference with you, has sturred up this glee
of good lykyng through all my parts, with more contentement of the happy
encounter, the^ my former greeues gave me cause of extreme dystresse, and yet
my martyrdom has neither been so small nor secrett, but the whole world
has witnessed my panges, and you also might have believed theyme, if either
the sorrow of my self, or reapport of such as took pity of me, had been of
creditt with you, whereof also I am yet to endure a more hard share (if yt
may be ymagyned by any brain) so that the same were hable to force a remorse
in you on my behalf, for the greatest felicity I have in this world is, to
have the favor of any commandment at your hand (what peril soever yt
ymportte) to the end my diligence and ready endeavor to do you service therein
or other your affairs what so ever, may iustefye the vow of my unfeigned
hacte toward you, like as also I persuade my self to be raised from a
hundredth thousand deaths together, when I ymagyn but a simple compassion in
you touching the torment I suffer for your beauty, wherein if ever I had
reason to take pleasure, by a delight which nature has wroughte in the
thing, I am sewer alredie to have hadd my part of a thousand annoies, by the
regards of cruelty I have found in you, ^^^^el at last good lady, the
commission of former torments, and cease hensfurth to plage him that is ready
in the place to comitt his body to any sacrafy ce for the ransom of your
favor, what moves you alas to a discreditt or doubt of my pain, with opynion
that my passion is dyssembled? let the sondrye sorts of tears heretofore
distilled on the behalf of your discurtesye, so many days brought to end
with continual sorrow, and nyghtes drawn out at length with drayninge sighs,
ye the present view of my pale and ghastelye, ghost persuade you of the
contrary, with assurance of my undoubted loyalty for ever? wherewith he
beheld her, not without a vente of soddayne tears trycklynge alonge his
cheeks, and she for her part regarded the earth with a face full of
dysdaine, (as yt seamed) which notwithstanding he construed to a proffitt of
his suit pursewynge the same eftesones in this sort. Ah madame have you the
heart to deface the glory of that deuyne beauty of yours with an act of more
TYRRANNIE then ever has been noted in any woman of former time? or account
you yt a virtue to kill him, who dyethe every hour in the very view and
remembrance of the heavenly perfection, wherein you only excel all that ever
have been called fair? if you resolved have my ruin, why stay you to do
execution, abridge godd Lady my lingringe torment, with a present dispatche
and end of life, deferr no longer the fatal ministers of your will, seeing you
are aggreed to perform the effect, and suffer at last my waterye eyes to stop
the streams of their ancient sorrow, deryued of the only view and
remembrance of the mystrys of their contemplacions, whereby my heart shall also
supp the last Syropp of desperate hope, and my affections vanyshe with the
dekaye of my body, who is hear ready to become your fattall harbenger in the
other world, with hope to reap there the hyer of my present merytt.

The Lady, whether her anger would give no longer place to his complaint, or
that she dowted a force or charm in the same to overthrow the fortress of her
chastetie, gave him the look of a waspishe mind, reprehending his rashness with
these or such like terms of reproach.

If my patience would yet give leave to your fond discourse, Zilya repre
hendeth her vvoer.
I see no want of desyer in you to attempt me with requests, which neither
is your part to prefer to one of my condition and calling, nor yet my honor
can brook, to hear of the mouth of such as soeke but to seduce the honesty
of chaste Ladies, wherein as you have exacted upon the frendshipp and facilitye
in me to here the uttermost of your suit, presumyng (belike) of my consent to
depart with that which you can not restore me again, So, besides that the
present experience of your foul intent, shall serve me hereafter as a
warraunte against the assaults of such offers either in your self, or any
other equal to you in disposicto^, I can give no other answer to the terms
of your request, nor favor to your foul attempt, but that from the instant,
you cease to solicit me either by your self, or any ambassador on your
behalf, protestynge unto you (for my part) neither to be seen in the street,
nor other place of public being, so long as you are in the countreye, and
much less suffer thaccesse of any Gentleman within my house, onles he be my
near parent or allye, by which means your importunities only shall punish
me with a sorrowful restrainte and absence from the society of my old
companions and friends: which last resolucion seamed such a mystery to the
mind of thinfortunat Virley, that for the time, he stood as enchaunted or one
newlye dropped fourth of the clouds, till at last as one wholly converted
into despair of further favor at her hand, he craved only, for
consideracion of his pains paste, and last farewell of his loyal faith to
her, a kiss, which he said should satisfye his longing at full, and
discharge her of further pursewete according to her request.

The malicious Lady notinge the fond desyer of the knighte, and with what
small cost she might now rydd her of an importuante suter, meaning
notwythstandyng to depart with so small a favor, but for a price of great
penance to him that sought to buy it, told him, that as well to satisfye his
present request, as also to make a further prooffe of his faith, she would
perform the full of his last demand, if he would give her assurance by the
says of a gentleman, to do one thing wherein she was to require him, which
the simple Vyrley did not only promise by all protestations of religion or
oath, but pawned also the majesty of the highest for performyng every such
commandment as it pleased her to enjoin him, wherewith she seamed satisfied
touching thassurance of his consent, and thereupon entered into theffect of her
own promise, embracinge and kissynge him as if it had been the first night
of their marriage, requiryng him in like sort to become the master of his
word and aduouche the points of his late grant.

The pore gentleman suspectynge no one thought of such tyranny in his
mistrys, and much less that he should buy his kisses at so dear a price,
told her he attended the only sommonee of her commandment, to the end she
might witness his ready endeavor to obey her: she enjoined him that from that
hour till iij. years were expired, he should become muett, without speaking
in any sort to any creature living, how great so ever his occasion appeared,
in the true observing whereof (says she) shall appear an experience of your
faith, which also may force hereafter a further benefit for you, where the
contrary will not only discover your villa^nte, but be ready to accuse you of
perjury on the behalf of a Gentlewoman. He thinks I see the perplexed
countenance of the pore knighte, who hearing the sentence of his hard
pennaunce, judged as great injustice in her, for taxing him at so cruel a
rate, as difficulty in him self to perform theffect of so strange a charge:
albeit his heart was so great, and he so papisticall in performynge his vow,
that he began even then to enter into the points of her commandment,
declarynge by signs that she should be obeyed, wherewith he gave her an
humble reverence and retired immediately to his lodging, faygnynge to such as
were about him, that the extremetie of a cold rhume distillynge from the
parts of the brain had taken away the use of his tongue. And because his
domnes should not be a greeffe to his friends, nor they move his disquiett in
demanding the cause, he determined to be a stranger to his country till
the years of pennaunce were run out, wherewith committynge the order of his
affairs at Mountcall or else where in Pyemount to the creditt of such as he
thought meet to supplye the place of such trust, took two or three of his
familyar companions to assiste his voyage, which he directed rightelye into
france as a countreye most meet for his abode, chiefly for the mortal
wars as then between CHARLES the seventh, and the valiant English men
possessynge his country, in the year 1451.

And as the King was then in campp in Gascoyne, with intent to pursewe the
goodness of his fortune, and deliver his country altogether from thenglishe
nation, he addressed himself and force to the Duchye of Normandye, where this
Pyemountaine knight, being in the campp, was known by and by to diverse of the
chiefstaines about the king, as well by the notable service they had seen him
do in diverse places, as also great creditt he has had before with thearle of
Pyemount, who after became Duke of Scauoye, where was great repair of the
nobilitye of France, for that he married Madame Iolante second daughter to
CHARLES the seventh: after they had a while lamented his lack of speech
(not knowing for all they could do the cause of such disease) they
presented him before the Majesty with such commendacyon of his virtue and
valyauntnes in arms as was necessary for the worthynes of the same, which
forced a great liking in the King toward him, alalbeit his outward
apparaunce argued infficiently his inward dexterity that way, which also he
confyrmed in pub lick view in an assalte which the king gave to the english
men within Roan, the chief and only bool warke of the whole country of
Normandy, where Signeur Philibarto gave such effecces 1451.

called La Pucelle lean, whom some pratinge frenchmen do affirm to have
wrought merueiles in arms during those wars, but chiefly that under the
conduite of her, our countryemen lost Orleance wc diverse other holds in those
parts, and for a memory of that forged ydoll they keep yet amongst other
relikes in the abbay of. S. Denis,, which I saw in May last, a great roostie
sword, wherewith they are not ashamed to aduowche that she performed diverse
expedicions and victories against thinglishe nation, which seames as true, as
that which they are a shamed to put in a chronicle of credit touching their
saint Denis, whom they affirm was erecuted at Paris, and came from thence with
his head in Written in their book of (...) called ca^alogue des martuis.

times by the way where they have founded iiii. crosses with the headles image
of saint Denis holding a stonye skalpe in his hand, but now to our Dom
Philiberto, whose forwardnes and fortune in the last assalte, being well noted
of the king, began to kindle a credit in the mind of the majesty toward him
in such sort, as besides special praises given to his worthynes in the
hearing of all his capteines, he presented him with the state of a gentleman of
his chamber, with pension sufficient to menteyne the port of that place,
promisinge besides an increase of his bowntye, as he saw a contynuance of his
good service, for the which the mute knighte gave the king humble thanks, by
signs lifting his hands toward heaven as a witness of ye faith, he promised
to keep without spot to his prince, where of he gave good declaracion not long
after in a skirmishe, procured by the french against the English soldiers,
under the guide of the only flower of chyualrye of that time, and valyant
Captcine the Lord Talbot, whose virtue made him so famons in those wars, that
the very remembrance of his name procures a terror to the stowtest frencheman
that this day lives there, in this skirmish (if a man may credit a french
brag) the Pyemontoyse and Talbot met, and vnhorssed each other, whereupon the
king in consideracion of his present service and increase of further courage to
continue his soldier, made him Capteyne of diverse holds, with charge of
fyftie men at arms, with promise (in the word of a prince) yt her eafter he
should find in more ample ma ner, in what sort princes ought to consider the
service of such whose virtue brought soccours to the necessity of him and
his people, wherein truly a prince has great reason not only to bestow
rewards upon such as deserve well, but embrase that which carries a licknes
of his own nobylitie, saying that virtue, in what place soever she take
root, can not but bring furthe good fruits, the use and effect whereof, ought
to appear upon such as approach or resemble the place, where the first seeds
were sown, neither does any degree of men (according to thopinion of Plyny)
deserve so well of his prince, as the soldier, in whose wounds (says he)
are enclosed the sauetie of the whole country, and quiet of the seat royal,
neither does he shrink to adventure his body against thennemye, to establish
the reapose of his neighbor at hoame who to requite his many dangers in ye
field, or releue his maimed lymmes, consumed wc ye wars, comittes him at his
return to the rigor of justice and that most commonly without cause of just
offense, whereof I think no one contry of christendom, is hable to furnish so
many examples of that misery, as the state of England, where as (god be
praised has benn no great occasion of war, since the happy reign of our
most blessed Queen that now governs) so (the Lord, and her majesty amend
it) it is a pitye to see how slenderly soldiers be provided for, and how
tyranouslye they are persecuted by the malice of caterpillors in Cities, and
franklinges in the country, whereof I wish some such as I could name to
mooster in the mowthe of a trenche, or stand in the face of a breach, to
the end they might both witness the danger, and be partakers of the peril of
war, which I doubt not would force in the most of them a compassion,
touching the soldier, whom also they would defend from being deuowred of
the gallows, by their malice. Thus much on the behalf of soldiers,
toward whom I wish as indiffrent a care in time of peace as they are ready
and most sewer to abide al danger when it pleases the prince and realm to
call them to service, and now to our dome knighte, who embrased of the king,
with honor of all his Capteines, was assisted with a second mean of further
credit with his prince, for that ymedyatlie after the heat of the wars in
france and the country resolved to a quiet stay, it pleased the king, for
the solace of himself, and general contentinente of his Capteynes to call a
torney royal on horseback, where Seigneur Virley enioyeng ye benefyt of his
former fortune, wan only ye glory of ye tryumphe, which gave such increase to
ye good opinion of the king, yt he entered into council to cure his dome
disease greuinge not a little that so valyant a gentleman cold not declare his
devise, which seamed to argue no less wisdom, for the direction of a common
welthe or country, then the force and agilitye of his body had sufficiently
approved his virtue in diverse exploites during tha^ war: wherefore he
dispatched general letters thorowout his own Realm, with special requests
to the countries adioyninge his kingdom, that who cold give remedy to his
evil, and convert his present scilence, into a liberty of free speech, should
have ten thowsande frankes for reward: then might a man see such a mooster
of phizisions, and Chirurgions with their appoticaries carienge their bags
and boxes of all confections, that their rowte seamed rather a new supply of
power to assiste the king against his ennemies, then a convocation of
gownesmen to consulte of the disease, who began also to make such war with the
ten thousand frankes, skirmishinge one with an other, not so much for the
glory of the act, as gain of the money, (without any help
notwithstanding to the sickman) that the king was driven to add to his
golden offer, an express condition, that who soever undertook the cure,
without performynge the effect within a certain time, should make good the
said sum to the commodytie of the king, or for want of paymente to leave his
head in pawn, which proclaimed ymediatlye a general retire to Monseur le
Medecyn, with the rest of his mistical crwe and wypinge his nose with the
insyde of his sleue, detested with ympietie, both Galleine, Hypocrates, and
Auiecenes, with other patrons and ancient fathers of physic, that would not
leave them a sufficient net to fysh so great an honor and riches as ten
thousand frankes: the brute was no sooner made then thofficers of fame
undertook to disperse it into every corner of the countreye, with participacion
of the royal edicts and liberality of the king to every province as well on
thissyde as beyond the mountes, wberuppon Montcall became pertaker of the
news and Zylya (the first and only cause of al) was pryuie (by this means)
to the place of aboade of her penytenciall lover, and also persuaded of his
loyalty in keeping his promise unworthy any way of such firm regard: saying
that where fraud and force do occupy the heart, the religion of promises, yea
the very bond of faith already given, do loase their force, neither is a man
bownde to perform yt, wherein is co^straint of bond: The covetous widow,
assuring her self of no less authority over Seigneur Virley the^ when he made
court to her at Montcal, determined to go visit him at Paris, not so much of
intent to undo the charm of his dome disease, as desierous of the ten thousand
fra^kes, whereof she made as sure account, as if they were already under the
sewereste lock in her closset at MONTCALL, perswadyng her self also, that the
gentleman (being absolved of his promiss by her) would gladly consent, and that
she only should have the reward and fame of the thing, wherein all others were
hable to work no effect.

Here you see a woman, whom neither the virtue of honest and true love, nor
intent of unfeigned and loyal service, cold earste move to compassion, and
much less aggree to give ease to the sinister affliction of her servant,
wrested to a remorse, and overcome with a desyer of fylthie gain, to enlarge
her richesse. Oh execrable thirst and desyer of money, until when endures
thy authority over the world, or how long will thou blind the minds of
men, with a foggie myste of fylthie lucre? Ah insatiable, and perilous golphe,
how many haste thou devoured and drowned in thy bottomless throat, whose
glory had pearsed the heighte of the clouds, and virtue shyned more clear,
then the brightness of the son, if the dark veil or shadow of thy contagiouse
infection, had not eclipsed their renown that way? the fruits alas which
thou bringe^st forth, (what sugared show so ever they give outwardely) yeldes
in deed neither honest fame, nor true felicitye to such as reap them: Saying
that, that dropseye and infectyng humor which ouerronneth all their parts,
makes them more desyerous of the thing, then hable to be satisfied, whereby
grows a double discommoditie to the evil of that, which is thonly The
desire of vnho^e^te gain, the fountain of all evils.
fountain of all mischief, neither is any state more miserable, then to have
a desyer to have much, and gettinge al, can not be satisfied with any thing,
and in the end, overthrown in their covetous travel by infamouus death,
whereof I am content to omit the familiar prooffes of our time, and present
you with the authority of the rich Crassus fell into the hands of (...)
Crassus in Rome, to whom was awarded the punishment of God, by falling into
the hands of the Parthens, for violacion and committing sacrilege within the

and wholly infected with the poison of him that formentes the heart of the

will now pass over both foreign and familiar records, and restore to your
memory thabuse of this Zilya, who forgetting her former regard to virtue, (the
only ornament of her honestye and reputacion) feared not also the toil and
travel of the way, nor other inconvenience what so ever, to committ her life
to danger, and honor to the mercy of him, in whom the remembrance of her
former wrong, sturred up a desyer of double revenge, upon the least occasion
he could find, neither doubted she to hazard the effect of her buysynes in a
strange region unknown to al men, saving to him, for the only honor of whom
the misterye was wrought, but using a short consideracion for the order of
her affairs at Montcall, she strippes the mountes, and by extreme labor,
arrived at last at Paris, at such time as every man dispaired most of
recouerye of the dome knighte, albeit, enquiringe for them that had authority
to admit such as undertook the cure, she made it be published that God had
putt the remedy of his disease into her hand, and that only she, doubted not
to perform thexspectation of the king that way: the Commissaries laid before
her the edict, with the condition of death in the end, if the knighte were not
made to speak within xv. days, all which she admitted, and pawned her life
for the performance of the enterprise, with protestation eftesones that god had
opened unto her a secrett mean to restore him, whereof the knighte was
furthwith advertised, merueilynge notwithstanding what strange gentlewoman yt
was that had undertaken to undo the charm of his disease, and force him to
break the vow of his penance to his cruel ZYLIA, in whom (of all other) he
accounted not so much frendshipp, as to make so long a journey for the ease of
the evil, whereof she only was the cause, he was rather of opinion that it
was his neighbor of Montcall, she I mean, that first solicited Zylya, on his
behalf, and now had forced her to a compassion of his penance, with
commission to absolve him of the rest of his hard vow, whereof as he devised
diversely without stayinge upon any certainty or trothe, behold the deputies
presents Zilya, in the chamber of Seigneur Virley, who saying an effect of
that, which erst he was not hable to ymagyne, gave judgment by and by, of
the cause of the coming of his enemy, and that the promise of ten
thousand frankes had more power to make her pass the mountes, then the
respect of friendship, or compassion to his straung distress, which so long had
kept him in the likeness of a dead man, wherwt, the view of her former
incyuilitie, and rigor exceeding the disposicion of any woman that ever was
noted cruel, procured lymedyatlye, a conversation of his ancient love andre
guard to her beauty, into a mortal hate, with desyer of vengance equal to her
offense, thinkinge it no grudge in conscience (in accepting the offer of his
fortune) to yield detestable homage in deed to the saint, that erst accounted
al his service but effects of ydolatry, and to return her friendship with a
trybute of the same money, with the which she made him taste the fruits of an
inordinate cruelty, as well for his own contentmente in acquitinge so good
atorne with semblable payment, as also to leave example to all coye and
disdaynefull dames to shonne the like abuse toward any honest gentleman, and
that, having regard to the merit of the persons and specially to the
reputacio^ of themselves, they become not so prodigal as to make a vent at a
vile price of their honor, which they ought to defend, and keep without spott,
against the assaltes of the most honest and virtuous lover that ever offered to
serve under the flagge of any beauty, how clear so ever it shoane, and yet
how many of those do we see now a days, who will not stick to deny the
service of such as proffer them love as well for the respect of virtue, as
desyer to embrase a fadinge glee of flickeringe beauty, and after commit
theimselues to open sale, to who will bidd most for them, which kind of
Venitian Madonas, as I wish to be barred the society of chaste ladies, and
not suffered to sytt amongst the most errande coortisans yt ever were, having
any spark of zeal or friendship in their heart, so they had but justice (in
mine opynion) if the benefyt or liberty of every common wealth were taken
from theime to the end they might wander as a kind of marked people of all the
world: for she that loves for money and makes a gain or certain revenue of
thuse of her body, will seldom make conscience to betraye him to whom she
gives contenance of friendship, saying her love (typped with a disyer of gain,
tendes altogether to ends of evil, and acts of tyrannoyse effect, wherein as
the honest sort of women are always defended by thintegretye of their
conversation and life, so I crave a patience in the rest, touching the
punishment I wish upon them, and spedie amendment of lif, to the end their
virtue may make them as meritorious of reputacion in deed, as some of theime
are vndowtedlye unworthy of the use of life, or benefytte of common air.

Seigneur Virley then having Zylya in his presence, and almost at
commandment, feigned not to know her, refraininge from all offers of
humanitye either, by salutinge her coming by signs of thankful countenance
or other ways, which at the first moved no small astonishmente in our wydow,
who, notwithstanding seeing she was entered in to an enterprise, theffect whereof
(she saw) cold not be performed without the loss of honor or life, made of
necessetie a virtue, with resolucion to commtt her to the mercy of her
fortune, and make a last prooffe of her goodness, what inconstauncye so ever
is given unto her of all men, wherewyth desyeringe the rest to retire, she
shoot the doare, and took the knighte by the hand, whom she beheld in the
face, and with a smylinge regard, asked him, if he had so sone forgotten his
dear ZYLYA, or if he had the heart to make so small acco^pte of her in that
place yeldinge her not long since such authority over him and all that was his
at Montcall? dissemble no more (says she) to know her, who has stayed for no
pains to comme hither to acquit you of your promiss, with request to pardon
the fault I have made in abusing the virtue of thoneste love you bare me, it
is I, who lamentyng my former crueltye, am here to do pennaunce for the wrong
I have don you, in restraining the liberty of your tongue, and taking revenge
of my former rigor, am to yield tribut to your rare loyaltye, with more
redines to dismiss the charm that so long has kept your tongue enchanted,
then ever I had reason to add so cruel a recompense, to your honest deserte.

All which seamed to move as many words in the dome knighte, as there is
life or feeling in the senceles rock standing in the midst of the sea, and
saying him make signs, that it was not in his power to speak, nor to remove
thenchauntement of his tongue, she was forced to recharge him with all sorts
of kisses, embracing and collyng every part of his face and neck, not without
great store of tears, wherewith she bedewed each part of his bossom and
outward garments, using thassistance of every mean wherein she judged
virtue to make him tractable to her request, which notwithstanding he returned
with a solemn scilence, and forgettyng his ancient ceremonies, and amarous
oracio^s, which he was wont to use, as perswacions of pitye to his Lady, he
alleged now a dispense from speaking by her commandment only, practicing
altogether (by signs) the use and execution of that, which earste he had so
hoatly pursewed, both by suit and long service, wherein as he seamed somewhat
awaked by her, that long had kept his mind in a s^omber, and drayned his
body both of desyer and courage, so he sought in like sort to set abroache
in her, an appetitt of that wherein she has been earste, no less curious then
straung, wherein she, for her part, (more to prevent the peril of life, and
loss of the peinall condition, then for any respect of frendshipp to the
knights,) made him the master of his request, with consent to use her at his
pleasure and frank possession of that, which he and all lovers account the
chiefest felicity in love, wherein they lived with equal contentement until the
end of xv days (the term appointed to cure the knighte) without that the
pore wydowe could make conversion of her dome patient, into a man using the
liberty of his speech, albeit she laid before him, in how many sorts she
grieved with her own folly, in binding him to so strange inconvenience, and
the penance she had don losing her honor, to satisfy his pleasure, and
absolve him of his vow: all which seamed as Hebrew songs to Seigneur Virley,
who determinynge to play double or quitt with her, thought it necessary to
add a further fear to her former loss, to the end, she might feel her part
of danger, as well as her crueltye had made him pyne away in secret sorrow the
better part of two years: which he performed accordingly, for, ye term
expired, and the knighte nothing altered from his ancient order of scilent
disposicion, the commisioners sommoned the Lady wydowe to perform the points
of thedict, importing ij. choises of perentorie extremity, either to pay ten
thousand frankes which she had not, nor was hable to get, or make good her
promise with the loss of her life, which she was sewer to perform, without a
special grace of the king, and that by thintercession of her enemy.

What was now the refuge of this Lady, distressed on every side, if not to
retire into tears, dropping with streams of present sorrow, in the remembrance
of her former cruelty* ah Zylpa sorovveth her for mer cruelty.
unhappy and thryswretched Lady that I am (says she) brought to due
desolacion and punishment by shame for an effect of cruelty exceeding the
barbarous disposicion of the Lurk or Moare, or other infidel without
religion or faith: in seekinge alas to deceive an other, I am fallen into the
danger appointed to give end to my life? Was it not sufficient for me to be
warned of the revenge of mine enemy, by mine own rigor used toward him,
but that I must attempt his courtesy, and willingly fall into the malice of
him, who, triumphinge in the spoils of mine honor, gothe about also to take
from me my life, and mortifye my renown Honesty the chiefest support of life.
for ever? Why fell I not alas into the Jaws of some wild beast in passing the
alps, or threw my self hedlong from the topp of some craggie mountain,
whereby I should have prevented the stroke of his malice, who seeks to make me
a wounder to the multitude, for attemptinge a thing, which restes wholly at
the will and pleasure of him, whom I had so haynously offended. Ah Seigneur
Virley, how can you bestow such cold consideracion, on the pleasures
wherein I have been so liberal on your behalf? or what moves these regardes
of disdain, with desyer to have the life of her, who if ever she offended,
has alredie performed the pennaunce of her falte? and what offense is so
great, which is not satisfied, with amends for the trespass? which if I have
not already answered, let my tears make good the rest of your rigorous
sentence? Imagine Seigneur Virley. What a virtue it is to forgive, where the
extremetye of revenge is the fowlest vice that occupies the heart of man. And
for your part, as you have made your self known to the world, by your
continual felicity in all your affairs, so stick not to make an increase of
your glory by preventing the peril of her, who lyinge prostrate before your
knees, bathinge the same in the sooddes of her sorrowful tears, does also
kiss your feet, in sign of repentance of her former follye? Ah let me not
dye for my simplicitye, nor min honor put to sacrifise, as a revenge of the
little wrong, which I confess my chastetie has don you: take not alas so
cruel vengeance upon so small an offense, neither suffer the blodd of my life
to quench the thurst of your malice, that have alredie paid treble tribute,
in respect of my falte, wherewith (meaning yet to continue in terms of
complaint) the sergeaunt Cryminall (with authority from the King) arested her
to prison, whether she went with small constraint, as wearye alredye with the
view of her present miserye and loathynge the use of longer life, having lost
the chief support of the same. But the knighte pinched with some remorse
touching the passion of his dear Zilya, thinking her sufficiently punished
for so small offense, went immediately to the king, to whom, in the hearing
of his Lords, he makes discourse of his love passed, the cruelty of Zilya in
bindynge him to a vow of scilence for iij. years, and the present revenge he
has taken of her discurtesye, with humble request in the end, to moderat the
rigor of his justice, both to her, and others that were in prison for his
recouerye, seeing (says he) the same depended either upon her that bound me
to that charge, or else upon thassistance of time, which at last would have
dissolved my dome france, by thaccomplishment of the thing which my faith
bound me to perform.

The king merueiled not alitle to hear so strange a historye, reioysyng
notwithstanding in the happy return of his speech, and giving singler
commendacion to the loyaltye of his knighte, condemned presentlye the cruelty
and covetousness of the widow, upon whom hadd followed execution accordinglye,
if it had not been prevented by the special intercession of Seigneur Virley,
who taking her out of prison, accompanied her certain days journey, as well
to show her the kings liberalitye in diverse towns and holds, which he had
bestowed upon him, as also to satisfye his appetitt at the full, with the
fruits, whereof he had fealte earste so pleasant a taste: wherewith also she
did not much mislike, for that the prooff of such favor unlooked for, took
away the pain of her late imprisonement iustelye deserved, besides, her late
despair of life, made her doble thankeful to the author of her liberty, which
she embrased with more co^tenteme^t, then when she knew not what it was to
loase the pleasant taste of free life, wherein may be noted an experience of
the dealing of fortune, who kepes in stoare, like punishment for all such, as,
reaposyng to much for them selves in their own force, do defye that little
which they account to consiste in others, and in respect of their own power,
do condemn the authority which other men have: if a vain glory and conceit
of a chastetye invincible, had not deceived this Lady, or a desyer of covetous
gain blaired her eyes, it had been hard to have judged her incontinencie,
which appeared, both in her frank familiarity toward ye passioned knight,
and also in gredie desyer to fill her pursse, and carye away the praise from
all other that undertook thenterprise, and yet as you see, her gain has
given a dishonest title to her name for ever with an occasion to thenemies of
women to cry out of the whole sect, but there is no reason that the falte or
follye of one, should impair in any sort the nobility of so many virtues
and honest Ladies, whose chastetie and honest conueigh of life, defendes them
against the cruelty and covetousness of this ZYLIA, and such as resemble her
in any sort, who after certain days of recreation with her lover retireth
into Pyemount, where she drew forth the remeinder of her years in continual
grudge and frett of conscience, with firm perswacion ever after, that the
force of man is nothing, where God does not work by his grace, without whose
assistance we can neither learn that which is good, nor defend our selves
from the danger of any evil, like as also, if we want that guide in our doing,
our works (smelling of nothing but the corrupcion of our own nature) make
us seame not much unlike the loathsome swine, wallowinge in a dortye or moddie
poodle, to increase her fylthynes,

FINIS.
The argument
A According to the lattyne adage, every vice, how perilous soever it appear,
has power to work in some degree, thopperacion of a special virtue, for albeit
the sondrie enormities growing daily amongst us, by the unbridled humor of
our affection, which we commonly call love argue the same to be a passion of
most dangerous and perverse corrupcion: yet we have experience of wonderful
effects of virtuous modesty wrought by that common evil, as the whoremonger
and adulteror reduced to a repentance and moderacion in his pleasures, the
tyran and Virtues in love.
morderor moved to compassion touching the cause of thin nocent, and the
unthrift reclaymed to an honest stay of lif, which makes me of opynion, that
this passion (given us by nature) albeit it be an infection of it self, yet it
serves also as a contrepoison to drive out another venym, according to the
property of the Scorpion, which of her self, and in herself, carries the
sting of mortal hurt, and oyntme^t of spedie remedy, thoccasio^ of present
death, and mean to preserve life: not meaning for all this to persuade, that
it is of necessity, we make our selves subject altogether to this humor of
good and evil disposicio^, nor allow them that willingly incurr the peril of
such fre ymprisonment, but placinge it for this time, amongst things of
indifferent tolleracion, because he neither seamed blind nor void of
discrecio^, on the behalf of those, whose era^ples I mean to prefarr in this
history. I may boldly aduoche that which we call affection to be a passion,
resembling in some respect, the condition of true amytie, and yet not much
unlike for the most part, the general evil which the Grecians ^al
Philautia and we term by the title of love, or vain flattery of our selves,
chiefly when we see any so frently to his desiers, that to satisfye the
inordinat thruste or glot of his gredie appetit, he forgettes hothe honor and
honesty, with the respect and duty of his conscience, besides what images of
virtue, courtesy, or bowntiful dispocision soever, our lovers do ymagyn in
them, whom they serve, dymming the eyes of the world with a miste of
dissembled substance, as though the cause of their liberal offer of service,
were derived of an intent of honest frendshippe, yet their travails that way
concludes (we se) with other end; for that, they hunt only the chase of
pleasure, procedinge of the view of an exterior beauty, wherein their meaning
is sufficiently manifest in the sugared oracions and discourses of eloquent
style, which those amarus orators seem to prefer, when their minds (occupied
wholly in the contemplacion of their mistresses, do commit the praise of the
perfection in their Ladies, to the filed fordge of their fine tongue, in which,
what other thing do they more chiefly commend, then a deuyn mystery or
conninge work of nature painted with a die of white or redd in her face: A
delicate tongue to dilate of matters of fancy, an entysinge countenance, with
a grace and behavior equal with the majesty of a princes, al which as they
argewe the vanity of him that reapose delight in such fondnes, differinge
altogether from the true ornaments of the soul, or pattorne whereby the
perfection of virtue is discerned by thunfayned works and absolute accion, So
dismissing this fond philosophy, not co^tending greatly whether love be a
natural corrupcion, or a thing perticipating with virtue, we may be bold to
aduouche his power to preauile in things which seame of ympossibilitie to
the other passions that be common unto us, for what thing can be of greater
force in a man, then that, which constrainynge an alteracion of custom, and
breach of that which by contynuance has taken rote within us, does make (as it
were) A new body, and the mind a meare stranger to her former cogitacions,
which I neither infer without cause, nor menteyne this argument without great
reason, for that as of all the vices which spot the lif of man, there is none
(except ye excecrable syn of whoredom) which makes us sooner forget god and good
order then the detestable exercise of unlawful game, neither are we so hardly
reclaymed from any thing, as that cutthrote delight, for that it is almost as
possible to convert the cruelty of a she wolffe or lyones into a present
mekenes, as to mortefie the desire of play in him, which has been norrished
and nozelled therein from the beginning of his years: Even so notwithstanding
the force of love, wrought such a mystery in an vnthrist of Naples, that of
the mo ste prodigal and ryotous spendor that has been noted in any age, he
made a most staide and sparing gentleman that Italy has brought forth of many
years, since or before his time, Albeit even upon the point and beginning of his
new fondacion, being ready with all to expose fruits of his happy chang from
evil to good trade, he was encowntred with the malice of his destinies, which
abridged his felicytie and life in one moment, whereof you may discern a
manifest proof in the sequeile of the history following.

PERILLO SVFFRETH much for the love of Carmosyna, and marienge her in the
end, were both two stricken to death with a thonderbolte, the first night
of their unfortunate marriage.
IT happened (not long since) in the rich and populus City of NAPLES, who
norrisheth ordinarylie an infinity of youth of all degrees, that, amongst the
rest of the wantons brought up there at that time, there was one named
Anthonio Perillo, who enioyenge a liberty more then was necessary to one of
so young years and green understanding, made absolute declaracion (affore the
race of youth did stopp in him), what it is to pass the years of correction
without the awe of parents, tutour or controller: for his father having
performed his Jornaye, which nature appointed him in this woorlde, resigned
his body to earth, and his goods and possessions to his son, who fyndyng
so many golden cotters and chestes full of treasure, to assiste his prodigal
and wanton dispocision, forgot not ymediatly to enter into the trade of a
licencius life. Wherein he found no stay nor ympedyment to his will, for that
the necligence of his father, had left him without the awe or authority of
any. And albeit in the life of his father he was a continual hawnter of the
Berlea or common Dicesing house.
house of unthrifty exercises, where, for want of sufficient demers to
furnishe his desire, with skill in casting the three deceitful companions of
black and white upon a square table, he was forced often times to forbear to
play, and learn conynge in lokyng upon, yet time with his own diligence,
made him so artificial, that being but a crier of awme, there were few hable
to excede his sleyghte in castinge twelve affore six of two dyce, or took
half so good accomte or regard to the course of the cards, and yet
notwithstanding he was not so well grownded in the principles of his art, but
often times (his conyng beguilyng him) he was prevented with a contrary
sleighte, and only his purse paid the charge of the whole company, which
was not unmarked of some two or three of the famyliars of his father, the
respect of whose friendship and virtue, with sondrie arguments of ymynent
destruction to his son, moved them to enter into terms of admonicion,
layinge affore him the circumstance of his sondrie faltes, but chiefly
reprehendinge the great wrong he did to his own estimacion, for that the
way to atteyne to renown of virtue, was Perillo reprehe^ded of cer teine his
fren des.
clean contrary to the vicious pathe of idle play, wherein he walked with
more delight then belonged to the son of so good a father, they gave him
examples of the destruction of many, and not one that used that idle exercise
dyed either with honor, wealth, or estimacion, that it was the shopp and
storehowse of all morders blasphemy, periurye, theft, glottonie, whoredom,
with an infynitie The house of play, a store house of all vices,
of other mortal inco^ueniences, and in the end, when play hadd left his
purse without a lynyng, and he not hable any longer to feed the vain of that
humor, but by unlawful means, he should be paid with the hyer of them who
without commission skowringe the plains do pray of what the find, and after
yeldes account to the hangman Tenaunte by the high way side called theaues in
plain english
upon the fatal hill, with a skarffe or collor of cord about their neck in
token of glory: They required a regard to the honor of his ancestors, but
chiefly not to discredit the honest life of his late father, for that (say
they) as the vyrighte doing of the child living susteyneth the renown of the
father being dead, so there can happen no greater infamy to the so^, then not
to make good the virtue and civil parts of his father, for end they aduysed
him to dysmisse his prodigal trade of life affore he were utterly bankeroute
of patrimony and possession, but he not liking to be pinched so near the
quick, and much less to hear the secrettes of his falte so plainly
decipherede, replied according to the discrecion of our wilful youth now
adays, given wholly to feed upon thapetite of their foolyshe fancy, that
touching the companies he hawnted, they were no worse then such as were
norished in the houses of princes, and familiar compainons to the greatest
lords of the countreye, and for the rest as he was not to yield account of
his life to any of them, so he wished them to bestow that care upon their
own children, for him, he was of sufficient years to govern him self, and
give convenient order to such affairs as belonged to his trade, wherewith he
stopped the further reply of tholdmen, who noting tharrogante terms of this
princkocks, committed him to the meede of his own folly, judging no time
convenient to reclayme him, til he had felt the smarte of the whipp famyn and
penury, with other pinching ertremities attendyng the end of an vnthriftye
life.

But he that scamed invincible against all good council, was made tractable by
him that plieth the most strong and Love.
stubborn upon earth, and that which men accomptes the only blindness of yt
world, unsealed the eyes of this you^gling and so took away the veil of his
arrogante folly, that acknowledging every point wherein he had offend, he
was not only privy to his own falte, but also pertaker of the penance. And
as one poison drives out an other, and no one vice that is not subject to
the correction of an other falte, so by that invincible ympression which the
Poets have painted in the shape of a blind boy properly called love, this
gamster was not only forced to a spedye change and alteracion of life, but
also after sondrie and sharp showers of aduersatie, restored to his ancient
entyer and place of honor and estimacion: for at the same instante within
Naples, soiorned a rich merchante blessed at gods hands chiefly with a
fair and virtuous daughter called Carmosyna, whose only beauty made more
breaches into the heart of Antonio Perrillo then the grave admonicions of
thelders or any other of his friends, and albeit he was (as it were) so
bewitched and drowned in the devotion of play, that all times seamed hateful,
which brought him not fresh supplies of gamsters, yet having once glaunced
upon the glisteringe eyes of this young girl, he could not so well govern
his encounter, that not only the desire of that idle exercise was clean
mortefyed in him, but also he suffered him self imediatly to be enrolled in the
book of loyal lovers, in such sort as he never delited so much in any play
at the dise, as now he doateth upon the beauty of Carmosinae, who for her
part, notynge sondrie entisynge glees, which nature had lent to the young
man, together with his bowntefull dispocition, with brave attire and courtlyke
wearing his apparel, which as it is one chyef allurement that somons yt
affection of a woman at this day, so the found woman will rather delight in his
small waste, and exterior pro portion, then ymbrase the virtue and gifts of
co^mendacion in a man, thought it an effect of equal courtesy, to return his
affection with semblable love, wherefore if he selte any tormente, her passion
was nothing inferior, which also grew to terms of doble grief on both
parts, for that they durst neither use ytcredit of any messinger to discover
their dark meaning, and much less were they assysted with means of
conference or access together, for that the maids thear are bownde to a more
strayte talk of liberty, then in our country, but for thoppynion of their
chastetie I leave it to the judgment of them that have had indifferent
experience of both the places. But Perillo, as most hottly assailed, and
least hable to resist thalaram, and feeling a taste of that whereof he was
ignoraunte in thoperation, and doubting altogether of thaccide^t til nature
made him understand the mystery, entered into his laborinth of endless annoye,
rauynge and raginge with hollow dreams, with doubt which of his wits he
might most boldly employe in bewraieng his vehemente affection to the new
mistrys of his heart, of whose good will, if he had but a simple assurance by
the breath of her own mouth, he seamed not to doubt any way the consent of
her, for that thinequalitie of degree and honor, rested on his side, perswadyng
withal that the merchant would willingly admit thallyaunce because the marriage
would bring a medley of honor unto the base and dark complexion of his house.
But in this account he forgatt the chiefest charge, and that which at this day
is most respected in making of marriages, I mean wealth and possessions,
whereof Perillo had already made merchandise and exchanged the most of that
which was his, for a simple remembrance of vain delites passed, neither did
he consider Riches most respected in marriages now a days.
the condition of his present state, with diminucion of his aunciente fame and
honesty by a general brute of his vnthristie life, all which notwithstanding,
love forced him to try the forde, and sound the heart of the fair Carmosyna,
assisting him also with a mean to have thacquaintance of an old matrone, her
outward gouernesse and inward credit of heart, whom he dandled with such
peppered perswacions, and infections of certain crowns, falling willingly
into her pockett, that she gave assurance of her help to thuttermost, both in
following and solicityng the matter, if it were once set a broch by him self,
which he performed by her the next day in a letter of this or like effect.

God forbidd, that any part of my body should refuce to condiscende Perillo
vvriteth to Carmosy na.
to that which my heart has alredye vowed touching my humble service on your
behalf (good madam) whose only beautye ceassynge not to maintain continual
quarrel with mine ancient quiet, has restored me to so general and mortal a
passion, that without the present dew of pity distillynge from the spedie
consent of your favor, I doubt whether nature is hable any longer to give
norriture to the feeble parts of my weary corpse, And saying the intent of my
affection is not only boyde of all dissembling and flatteringe abuses in the
virtue of true loyalty, but also ymportes a meaning and humble request of
lawful marriage, I crave hereby a confirmacion of your good will touching the
same, to the end that with the consent of your favor, I may march with more
assurance, to demand you of your father. I need not prefer the honor and
nobility of my house, to move you to indifferent consideracion of me, saying
your self can decipher sufficiently the particularities of my whole discente,
neither put you in remembrance of thauthoritie which of long has been due
to mine ancestors in this public weal, for that you are not ignorante of
any part of the same, all which if they lack force to move you to just
compassion, dispose your self (good Lady) to the view of my present
martirdom, and measuringe the justice of my merit with the greatness of my
greef, to send the messenger of spedie consolacion to him, who pyning in his
laborinth of unfeigned loyalty, attendes the happy news of your consent, and
in the mean while does humbly kiss the hand of the paragon Carmosyna. Your
loyal seruante Antonio Perillo.

The girl not erst accustomed to receive such embassages, seamed to prefer
some little astonishment at the first view of the letter, not for that she
misliked the contents, but to prevent cause of suspicion in her whom she neded
not have dowted, if she had been privy to the resolute league between her new
servant and old gouernes, who also for her part forgot not here to apply the
cataplame of her promise for commending the sondrie good parts of the
gentleman, persuaded her that it was an effect of virtue to aid thaffliction
of such as suffer distres, and that her honesty cold no way stand in awe of
slander in requiting a most loyal and unfeigned love with reciprocal
affection, besides says she, in the alliance consistes a decoracion and
increase of honor to al your house wherwyth, indeuoring yet to sporr her, who
of her self was sufficiently bent to run that cariare, wrested at last not
only an equal love in the girl, but also a confirmacion of the same by a
letter which she returned unto him under thies terms.

As Well by the roundnes of your letter (Sir) as relacion of my gouernes, I
understand the frank offer of your unfeigned Carmosyna aunsvve rethe the
letter of Perillo.
frendshipp, wherein as the iustire of your meritt moves me to expose
thuttermost of the consideracion that my power is hable to perform, so I grieve
that any restrainte should be an ympediment to ye liberal recompense of the
large honor you offer me by my parents, from whom albeit must proceed the
chief and principal answer to your demand, for that the yoke of dutiful
obedience keeps the grant of my good will under the awe of their consentes,
yet seeing the vehemency of your love which has divided himself into a
simpathia or equality of affection in us both, and reaposing much for my
self in thintegretie of your meaning, I wish my father would rather admit
your present request, then delibrate upon the choice of other husband for me,
wherefore my advise is you give a charge of his good will with such terms as
you account most convenient to feed the humor of angry old men, therpedicion
whereof I commit to the vehemente suggestion of your inward desire, which
(without the consent of my parents) I can not satisfye otherwise, then with
a simple zeal, whereof I send you herewith tharticles of assurance sealed with
thunfayned faith of your most dear and loyal. Carmosynae.

The operacion of this answer seamed of such force, in the heart of Antonio,
that he ymagined he embrased at thinstante the fair Carmosna, persuading
alredie a resolute consomacion of the bargain by old Minio her father, to who^
with more have then good speed, he declares the next morninge, the honor and
honest love he bare to his daughter, with desire that he would admit him for his
son in law, wherein his expectacion was not only frustrat, for that the
replye of the marchante seamed to excede the compass of his conceit, but also
ymported terms of reaproch, and reprehending his disordred Mynio deny the to
mary his daughter to Perillo.
youth advised him that affore he went about to marie, to learn some trade to
redeem his possession or else, procure such compotente portion, as might both
sustain him self and family, and also preuente the miseries of oldeage, if
god blessed him with so long a time in this world, for (says he) I will not
commit my daughter to any, but such as having sufficient to menteine her
estate, is also careful too increase that which god and fortune have ymparted
unto them, neither shall the respect of your pleasure, move me to condiscende
to the misery of her, whom you say you love, for I wish rather to see the
just destruction of the one, then thindifferent desolacion of you both,
meruetlinge also that love has sturred up this request in you, saying that if
you honored Carmosina in such sort as you say, you would also be careful of
her advancement, but as I see and know well enoughe, that the wanton
instigacion of a folishe appetit so moves you to make a demand of that which
shame and raison forbid you not only to pursewe, but also persuades you to
exclude utterly out of your remembrance, so let thyes few words suffice
for a resolute answer, that the view of your unthrifty life hetherunto,
with the needful condition of your present estate, makes you unworthy and
unable to enjoy her whom otherwise you should have found me no less
willing to have joined in co^sente, then you desierons to demand her in sort
of honest marriage.

Thies last words and answer not looked for of tholde merchant, brought no
small perplexity to our pore Perillo, who by the vehemencye of his passion,
was forced to abandon the place and retire to his lodginge, where, with tunes
of great dollour he entered into a suruoye or view of his former life in this
sort. Is it possible (says) he that pouer tie shall bring me in contempt,
and keep from me the use of the thing whereof I made so sewer account? or is
the remembrance of the idle exercises of my wanton youth past, The co^plai^t of
perillo.
the only ympediment to this new alliance with Minio? what reason has he to
deny me ye title of his son in law, and much less to hear me skarce speak
in the demand of his daughter if not yt he sees so general adyminucion of
the portion and possession, that were left me, by my inordinat and prodigal
trade of life, fearing also that play (consumyng me by piece meal) will leave
me in the end neither revenue nor renown, nor skarcelye a simple remembrance
of the house whereof I took my beginning? I would mine eyes bad been
seeled, and hands tormented with the quyueryng palsy, when first I learned
the subtilities and sleigtes of cards and dise. I wish I had been bound to a
task of painful toil without releace from travel, when first I gave
commission to that idle trade, to supplante all desire and necessary care in
preseruinge ye entire of my fathers remain? how unhappy was I alas to kick
at the council of such, as reprehendyng my follies, preferred an affectioned
care of my commodity? why was I so unthankful to their zeal, and unwilling
to follow their advise? if I had put a brydel to my pleasure, I had eschewed
this hard penance of my unthrifty youth, which now I find (alas to late) to
stand most need of the admonicions of ryper age, Ab I would I had sooner
Sipped of the cup of love, to the end, that being brought to the knowledge of
that whereof I find to late an experience, I might have preserved the
greatest part of that which I have alredie lost, but what? shall my desaster
passed, take away the hope of a future fortune, or mortefie all expectacion of
thassistance of a better time? or is it a virtue to despair in distress? no,
let rather the view of my disorder passed put me in remembrance to retire to a
new government and trade of life, in such sort, as with an honest endeavor
to make store of that which is lest, and reclaim the rest that is gone, I
may give absolute argument to the world of a change and amendment of life,
which also may convert the hardness of the heart of Minyo into a disposicion and
desyer to confirm the honest league which I crave at his hands, where upon he
put such expedicion to his new devise, that in one instante, renouncing
every point and circumstance of his former life, he was transformed from the
form and inclinacion of a second Acolastus into the shapp of a sparinge
merchant, wherewith taking thaduise of some of his friends, who also assisted
his honest endeavor with some portion of money, he converted the small remeinder
of his inheritance, into some three or four thousand crowns (with an
intent to bear an adventure with certain marchantes that were upon the
point to furnish a voyage from Leuant to Alexandria, a City in Egypt builded
by the great Alexander, being at this day thonly trade of the East parts,
for all sorts of spices and other merchandise of great value, and from whence
(for the most part) the Venetians, Genoeys, Florentins and other countries
of Italye keeping their bank and store houses there, do furnishe all Europe
with such kind of necessary traffic.

The infortunat Perillo converted wholly (as you see) into a marchante
venteror, with no less desyer to restore his wealth, with the gain of his
present trade, then earste he had delight to consume all in idle exercise,
committes his portion to his fortune, and amongst the rest of the
adventurers, hoysseth sail in hope of better speed then it was his chance to
encounter, for they were not fyftye leagues upon the main Sea, when they were
sharpelye assailed by an angry Neptune, who mislikynge their voyage, set a
broche the malice of the winds, forcynge the Sea to so high a billatt and
unruly rage of the waves, that thimpetuositie of the tempeste, took away the
force of the pylottes and maryners in such sort, as being no longer hable to
resist the furye of the storm committed them selves and shipp to the mercy
of the waves, which ceased not to continue in extreme furye the space of
three days and nights without intermission, in which time their fortune had
put them upon the coaste of Barbaria, where the malice of the winds
appaised, and the Sea retired to his ordinary quiet, albeit thignorance of
the coaste and country (a common enemy to all christendom) offered them cause
of new fear, yet the view of their late peril passed, mortifyed all
suggestion of new sorrow, and procured them to a more congratulacion then if
they hadd alredye performed their expedicion, and were saflye arrived in the
harbor of Leuant.

But fortune, who had yet an other act of tragical malice to present unto
thies wretches, lay in wait to assail them with a second desaster more
extreme then the first, whose alaram made a conuercion of their hymns and
Psalms of reioycinge, into tears and dollorous exclamacions: for as they lay
at anchor, in the euenyng when the night began to cover the earth with his
dark mantell, behold a pirott of the Mores (partaker also of the malice of
their te^peste) beset them upon a soddaine, with certain brigandines (most
fit vessels to do a mischief in a calm, and charged them so whotly on all
sides, that being alredye for wearied with the tormente of their peril passed,

blood, their goods spoiled, and them selves carried prisoners to Thunys to
live in extreme miserye under the servile yoke of the Barbarous nations.

Here if the master cried out for the loss of his shipp, the Mariners to be
deprived of their hyer, and the marchantes to see the spoil of their goods
with hindrance of their venture, I leave you to be judges of the passion of
poor PERILLO, who dispairinge to be redeemed, for that his whole substance was
committed to pillage in that misfortune, exclaimed against thiniquitye of the
gods, for that they seamed to favor his miserye with a term of longer life,
he wished death might make no stay to do his office, for that he loathed the
view of his sondrie adversities, and yet he seamed to sorrow more in the loss
of his fair CARMOSYNA, then in the despair of his Raunson, for the hard
bordes of the galleys, being his bed in the night, the bare penyworthes and
hongrie share of vittailes which his kepers presented him withal, thextreme
toil and togginge at the ore, with the smartinge whipp now and then about
his bare sholders, did not so much tormente him, as the remembrance of his
lost mistres seamed to force him to doble dollor

my pleasante life at hoame, and spente the remeinder of my portion in the
supply of my delicat trade, then loase my whole substance at one blow, and my
self coffred in a wretched and stinkinge dongeon? here may be noted one
chief fruit of covetous desire, and an effect of filthy gain, when the
gredie mind, in goinge about to glott thappetit of his coffers, leaves an
example of his wretched folly to all ages: Oh how happy be they, who
contented with the gift of a mean fortune, do not seek to load ships, and
remeine from hour to hour within three inches of death, either to be buried
in the bellies of the monsters in the Sea, or being cast upon some deserte
shore, to serve as pray to the devouring Jaws of wild beasts? was it not

By this time fame had ymparted the desolacion of our venturers to the whole
City of Naples, not without the general sorrow of all men, and special
tears of such as were contributarie to the loss, albeit making of necessity
a virtue, time gave end to their dollor and dismissed them all, with desire
to redeem his captif friend, but Carmosyna knowing her PERILLO to be one of the
miserable number, and waighing the circumstance of his mishapp, which stood
upon terms of more extremity then all the rest, both for that by the
loss of his portion, she douted to set him on foot again, and much more
dispaired of means to pay his raunson, entered into such present rage, that
she was ready to use force against herself, whereunto she hadd putt an effect,
if it had not been for her gouernesse, who reprehending sharply her wilful
folly, appeased at last (with great raison) her desperatt intent,
converting the furious humor of the desolate maid into a river of tears,
distillynge a main down her reasie chekes, complayninge notwithstanding with
terms of greef, the misfortune of her friend, but chiefly for that her self
was the principal cause of his ruynous estate, and that the rude answer of
her father forced him to abandon his country, for the gain of a contynuall
captivity?

of men do change, and of a prodigal youth procedes a sparing old man,
neither ought we to despair of his recovery, who fynding ye falte of his
own folly, disposes him self to amendment of life. what cause of care has
he either of the poverty or rich^^^ of his children after his death, seeing
the remembrance of the world dekayeth with the loss of life? can he carry with
him any care of our advancement, seeing he is forced to leave behind him the
thing which is more dear unto him then the prosperetie or health of his

where the mind is not in quiett.

No, no, let him use the skoape of his crabbed age, and do what he thynkes
good, for my part, I will not be desloyall on the behalf of him, who I know
honoreth me with sincere affection neither shall he lie long in prison, nor
continue any time the son of poverty, for I know where be a company of

doubt not will both pawn his delivery, and furnyshe him with a second trade

Wherein albeit she exceded the maid with speed in excucion, yet ought we to

the respect of present pleasure, takes away the remembrance of their
absente friend, and makes them unmindful of the faith of their former
promise, wherein I am not provided to enter into argument at this present,
both for that I do^t to gain displeasure in discoueryng a truth, and also
such discourse is without the compass of my comissio^, which is now to
recompte unto you the delivery of pore Antonio.

Old Minyo the father of Carmosyna had joined with his richesse and desyer of
worldly gain, certain virtues and commendable gifts, as veraye deuote in
visiting the churches and places of prayer, of a charitable disposicion in
releuing the distress of thafflicted, and so full of compassion on the behalf
of the nedie, that seldom any poor man departed from him empty handed,
besides, he extended amerueilus charity and act of pity to the desolate
captives amongeste the Moares, in such sort, as making every year a voyage
into Barbaria, he made an ordinary, to redeem and bring away with him ten or
twelve christian prisoners, of whom such as were hable, restored the price of
their raunson, whithout any interest, thinkinge the gain sufficient in that he
was the cause of their delivery, but the rest he sent frelie into their
country exspectynge the meede of that virtue at the hands of god, with this
only charge, that in remembrance of the benefit, they would not forget him in
their private prayers. The gift of wealth was not evil bestowed upon this
merchant, considering he was thankful in ymparting it to the poor,
according to thadmonicion of the gospel, but how many may a man reckon in
england, that excedes him in riches, and skarce one of semblable virtue, for
the peruersatie of our age is comme to that point, that wheare our fathers and
grandfathers delited in works of charity, with care to supply the necessity
of such as did want, our Helloes and golphes of riches do not only close
their ears against the lamentable cries of the needy, but also make no
conscience to dispoile them, either by awe, fear or flattery, of that little
which their fortune has left them, in such sort, that Alms and devotion
seames such strangers and so little known amongst men now a days, that of
thies few that soccour the poor, the most part, do it rather of vain
glory, or to condemn the barbarus disposicion of his neyghbor, the^ for
compassion on the behalf of him that stands in need: hospitalitye is also so
unknown amongeste us, that where our ancestors builded houses endowinge
them with sufficient revenues to sustain thimpotent and nedye persons, with
free annuities and other means of relief, how many of the members of christ
do we see in our time void of harbor to shroode their naked bodies, full of
diseases, pinched with extremity of honger and cold, ready to give up the
ghost at the gate of the richeman, and yet not reliued with so much as the
cromes that fall from his table: I borowe thusmuche on the office of the
preacher, not with intent to charge him any way with imputacion of negligence
in the pulpit touching his admonicion to the people to assiste the distress of
such as god visits with the Rod of affliction, but in presenting our
marchantes with a familiar example of the office and duty of a true christian,
to sturr them to the ymytacion of the like virtue, and in being ashamed, that
such as have gone affore us, have carried with them to heaven, all effects of
charity, to dispose them selves to seame worthy of that which they have, by
yeldynge a certain tenth or tribute of their goods to such as ye scripture
terms the deputies of christ askinge it in his name. But now to our father

certain his factors to redeem ten Captives of his country, or at least to
furnishe the number with any that professed the Law of Christ, which was
performed accordingly with such good fortune on the behalf of Antonio Perillo,
that he enjoyed a perticipacion of the devotion and benefit of Minio, and was
sent to Naples amongst the rest that were redeemed, not being known
notwithstanding of any his coprisoners or other of ye company, for that they
had not had any great enterview together, and much less of his Perillo
redeemed from prison.

more easily. But what can beguile the eye of a lover, or who is hable to
conceile from a woman the face of him, whose picture she bears in the bottom
of her heart, and whose remembrance death him self is skarce hable to deface,
Carmosyna, which made her thought a loking glass to behold every day thymage
of her Perillo, had no sooner glaunced simply upon him, but she knew it was he,
who for her sake had passed the panges of so many torments, wherewith no
less glad of his return, then he doble dowtfull of the contynuance of her
good will, wrought so much by the sleighte of her gouernesse, that she had
place of conferrence with him in secret, where after certain congratulacions
of his delyuerye she exposed terms of compforte in this sort.

tasted to thuttermost force and extremity, yet your Carmosyna has neither
forgot any part of thauncient goodwil she has borne you nor much less
entered into the least contempt that may be ymagyned, but where a number of
other Ladies, would have dismissed their affection at the first sommonce of
aduersatie, I am here to aduouche an undoubted contynuacion of zeal, with a
treble increase of true love toward you, whereof I am also to yield you a
present proof in doble sort the one with an assurance of reciprocal amytie
until thextreme date of my days, the other, in consideracion that your
poverty proceeded by my means. I have provided a second supply of money to
renew eftesones your traffic, which being guided by a better fortune will
yield you (I hope) a success of such commodity as my father will deny you
no more the title of his son in law, whereof for my part, I pronownce (from
thinstante) such confirmacion as is in me to perform: These news unlooked
for, sturred up a trance of such alteracions in the trobled mind of Perillo,
that what with the gredie desyer his eyes had to feed upon her beauty, which
he had not regarded of long time but by inward contemplacion, and the passion
of present gladness in thassurance of her love, with a frank offer of spedie
assistance to restore his trade, he had neither the use of his tongue to expose
terms of thanks, and much less the consent of his senses to believe that
which he hard, but as one Zenopholus atte^ding the answer of his oracle or
soddeinly stricken with a dome apploplexie, stood as immouable as thymage of
saint petre in the Capitol of Rome, till she rechargde him with a second
consolacion, and withal presented him with certain bags full of duckattes,
where of she wylled him to defraie the value of his ransom to the factors of
her father, and dispose the rest in a second venture for merchandise, which he
performed accordingly, with the benefyt of so good time and fortune, that
sailyng with a prosperus wind to Leuant, he made his markett to such
advantage, that (in his reatorne to Naples,) thincrease and gain of his trade,
redeemed every possession which erst he sold, and left him besides sufficient
to furnishe his lackes in every respect, in such sort, as the common
judgment passed, that his welthe was nothing inequall to the richesse of his
father, and his present state as plentiful of all things as the first day he
seized upon the coffers and remain of old Perillo: amongst the rest of the
friends of Antonio, which reioysed his happy fortune, Carmosyna I am sewer
was not least glad, chiefly for that she saw her father begin to grow in
delight with the doings of the young man, who for his part also renewinge a
daily increase of affection toward his mistres, was in devise, by what means
he might eftsoon board the goodwil of her father, who^ he judged cold use
small reason in refusinge his request, saying his richesse were equal to
thappetit of his gredie mind, and his possessions and patrimony nothing
inferior to the best of ye City, wherefore for the more honor and solemnity of
the demand, he sent his uncle to sommon the fair Carmosyna, in sort of
lawful marriage with an offer of dowry at the discrecion of her father, who not
ignorante of the league of long love between his daughter and Perillo, whom
he knew to have first entered into change of life for the only respect of
her favor, thought it as great conscience to condiscende, as they had reason to
make the request, whereupon addinge an effect of expedicion to their present
agreement, the bale of contract was drawn and the marriage published ymediatly

notwythstandinge was vnhappelye abbridged contrary to all their exspectacions,
by the malice of a pitiful accident which fell upon them the very night of
their marriage in the house of tholde Minio: it was in the midst of the month
of June, at what time the heates being most vehemente, do force terrible
thonders and rage of weather in great extremity, by certain dry vapors and
exhalacions which the heat air draws up from the dry earth when as our
infortunat Lovers were new gone to bed, deuisinge together of their sondrye
misfortunes since the beginning of their love, and as they disposed them
selves to discharge the pleasante shot of marriage, behold the eleamentes above,
converting them selves into angry regardes, set abroche the roaring noise of
the fearful thonder, with such ympetuositie of blusteringe winds, that the
trees and houses of deep foundation in the earth, where not hable to resist
their fury, together with an unnatural opening of the sky, whereby the whole
earth seamed to borne with a glowe or fearful flame of lightening, at last
the air not hable to contain the heat, was forced to auent, when a man
might have seen fall in waters and places of fyrme ground, diverse stones of
sundry forms, some square, some rownde, some forqued and other long, piked
at both ends of the sharpnes of a nedell, derived be like of the congealed
substance of the heat and vapors of the air, whereof (as the fear of the
tempest hadd driven the bride and bridgrom to embrase one an other) So one of

gave end to their pleasure and life at one blow.

Here you see yt he, which escaped a merueilous peril of shyy wrake, and was
delivered out of the hands of the Barbaryans when he dispayred of all relief,
is not hable to shon the surie of the heavens, and inclemencye of his fates,
and much less to excede the momente which his destiny determined upon him,
Albeit if there be any one spark of pleasure in such misfortune, he was
assysted with a moderacion in the greatness of his distress, both for that he
dyed in the arms of her whom he loved no less then him self, and also hadd
her company to his grave, whom he cold not enjoy being on live but in
thought and inward regard, such was ye end of his love, wheri^ sewer, if love
were a creature of either se^ce or feling, he deserved to be reprehe^ded of
injustice, for yt he is pertiall and shows favor, not only to such as

offer of peril, but also gives good success to them, that, dissembling with
the virtue of true loyalty, have no other respect but to satisfye the glott
of their voluptuouse pleasure, where, on the contrary, this infortunat Perillo
embracing his wife in chaste and honest sort, was no less iniustly revenged,
then cruelly smothered by the fyery force of thonder, which strange kind of
death gave no small amaze to the whole city of Naples, both for the rarietie
of thaccident, and also the great wrong which the guider of amarus destinies
seemed to do to the loyalty of the young man, who deserved a better
consideracion for his sondrie distresses, then a fatal suffocacion or deadlye
blow of the heavens in the first beginning and earnest penny of his pleasure

a certain Epitaphe in Latten, which I have here composed in our vulgary verse
which it may please your Ladishipp to ymagine to hear pronounced by the
mouth of the dead Perillo, appearing half out of his grave, in his sheet,
trussed at either end with a fatal knott, speaking with a voice of terror,
according to his ghastelye regard.

And lovers ye that live, comme take remorce

Four vvinters long I ran a careful race,
Wherein I found the fruits of Crabbed fate,

But pinched still with panges of misers state

And friends forsook me in my greatest need

And fancy fedd me with the food of evil speed

And though the Seas did spite my good intent
Yet did they spare to spill me in their sands,
But adding force to that, which long my fates have men^
My goods and I, fell in the Pirottes hands,
VVher I in person pinchd with every pang of care,
My penance paid, with many a hongry share.
Ne was my love deuoide of like annoye
Sith she with equal grieff paid tribute to my pain,
She vveard her youth in dule in stead of joy
The vievve of my mishapps bredd vvo in every vain
Her pleasant time passd in continual tears
Whose sooddes aye bathd her green and maiden years.
But oh give ear, when we by happy lot
Did deame to find the end of all distress
And as in bed, we hopte to change the note
Of former pain to perfect ioyfulnes,
Behold alas the flagg of fatal wrath.
Orespred us both with panges of present death
Oh heavy happ, o peruersd destenie,
Oh lives ay framd in mould of vvretchednes
And borne to wear the vvreath of misery,
From all that erst have felt distress,
He is most cursd vvose state is so oppressed
That in his life fyndes no one day of rest.
Resign your terms, and tunes of ancient vvoo,
Who erst have wept in tears of equal greeff
No two on live, nor all that sleep belovve
More loyal wear, aye vvantinge still relieff
Then we, whose pictures here are placd in deep
And shrovvded both within the fatal sheet.
FINIS.
The argument.
THe tragical chances happeninge toth unfortunate sort of this world, albeit
at the first, do present a certain bitter taste with unsavory disgestion, yet
who Syfteth them to the quick, construinge rightly every cause of their
coming, and virtue in operacion, will not only judge them necessary for some
respects, but also discern in them an indifferent proffit and pleasure to
all degrees of present being, but specially, to future posterities, who may
learn by the view of former illes, to eschew the like harms in them selves:
And because every thing is appointed his peculiar season, and al acts cannot
agree with every time and al places, I have devised, that as I began my
histories with a comiqual discourse, So I intend to knit up with a
tragicomiqual reaport treating chiefly upon the self same subject, which the
fond do commonly Love.
prefer as a special couerture or sheelde of their faltes.

Thexperience is not strange now a days, what humor of rage does direct our
frail youth, governed by the planet of love, and what mortal inconvenience
does and would spring thereupon, if reason served not in some sort as a
moderacion of our folly even from the cradle to the full maturitie of our age,
quallefyeng besides by wholesome principles, the heat of our wilful appettites,
wherein like as amongst all the tyranous enemies which afflicte the body or
mind of man, he only gloriethe of force to alter our propper nature, what
perfection so ever it ymporte, converting our liberty into a disposicion of
servile thraldom, guided only by the reyne of his discrecion, So amon the
number of authorities heretofore alleged for the proof of the same, I have
thought good to prefer an example of ourtyme, happening in a gentleman of
Catalonia, who declaringe in him self by his togreat constancy two
extremyties of love and folly, has also painted out the picture of a
gentlewoman, no less light and inconstante, then love and such as follow his
loa^e be vain, seeing the small virtue which assistes their sonde endeavor, and
slender commodity, growinge by their vncerteiue service.

A WONDERFVL CONsta^cie in Dom Diego, who for the respect of Geniuera la
blonde, undertook a hard Penance upon the mountes pyrenei, where he ledd the
life of an hermytt till he was found out by chance by one of his friends, by
whose help he recovered both favor and marriage of his cruel mistres.
Upon the confynes of Catalonia, deuydinge Barcellonia and the mountes, lived
not long since an ancient Lady, the wydowe and late wife of a knight of that
country, who left her only a daughter to supply him in succession, and give
comfort to the desolacion and old years of her mother, in whom appeared rather
a fond zeal, then awful diligence in theducation of her child, for that she
seemed more willinge to flatter the vain humor of her young years, then careful
to reprehend the arguments of wanton dispocision apperinge in the younglinge,
who, besides her curious shapp of body, and lymmes, with wonderful perfection of
beauty wherein nature gloreth yet of her conninge, was assisted with so fair a
hair, fallinge by deuyne art in to crisped locks, deuidynge them selves (as
it were by appointmente) that the gold purifyed and tried by the flame of the
furnaise, seamed but a dark metal, in respect of the glisteringe glee of her
curled hair, whereby she was called of all men Geniuera la blonde, not far
from whose castle or place of a bode, was ye dwelling of an other virtuous
wydow, of no less estimation, for her riches and large dominions then the
other, and of equal honor and renown for honest life, who having only the
presence of a son, to restore the remembrance of her dead husband, used no
less care to bring him up in the discipline of every virtue, study of good
letters, together with a participation in thexercise of all noble recreacions
couenient for a gentleman of his condition and calling, then the fair Geniuera
reapposed felicity in the beauty of her glorious hear, wherein to assiste
the natural towardines of her son, she sent him to Barcelonia, the chefest
city of the country, where fortune favored his diligence with such
dexterity in all things, that upon the eyghtenth year of his age, his
perfection in learning, with wonderful sleyghte in exploytes of chiualrye,
gave causes of shame to all gentlemen and other degrees what so ever norrished
and bredd up in the like exercises, which sturred up such contentemente in
the good Lady his mother, that she knew not with what countenance to cover
the pleasure she took in the felicity of her son, a falte familiar enoughe
to a number of fond men, and a vice most common to all mothers, who
glorienge in the towardenes of their children, do flatter them selves with an
uncertain hope of their future virtue, wherein they do indifferente wrong to
their own ymagination, and advancement of their wilful and wanton youth, who
blinded with vain perswacion of creaditt of their parents, do think them
selves dispensed with all from further diligence, or to expose effects of
other duty, whereupon follows often times a number of indifferent myshappes
to them both, with cause of equal rebuke to the one and the other: and so
pursewyng the queste of my hystorye, it happened in the florishynge years of
this young gentleman Dom Diego, that Phillipp of Austriche only heir to his
father newlye deceased, passing through France toward Spain to inueste him
self in the Seignories of his late father, gave warning of his coming to the
City of BARCELONIA, who for their parts, entered ymediatly into devise,
touching the pompp and magnifisence, wherewith they might do honor to the
majesty of so great a prince, as ye son of the Emperor of the Romans,
amongst other solemnities, they dressed a rich and curious just, furnyshynge
the listes only with young gentlemen, here to fore not greatly exsperienced
in the use of arms, whereof as Dom Diego, was chosen chief of the one part, so
the king (for a more contentement to his subjects) being upon the skaffolde
to judge the lofty courage of thies young gallandes, had only his eyes upon
the young DIEGO, with a wonderful admiration of his force in so young years,
arguyng an undoubted virtue with thincrease of further age, to whom only he
awarded the glory of the feelde, with protestation that in his life, he hadd
not seen a medly better performed, seamynge rather a battaill or combatt of
experienced knights, then an exercise of delicate youth, not yet accustomed to
bear the burden of armor, and less acquainted with the travel of war,
wherewith as well, inconsideracion of the present towardnes in the wydowes son,
with courage to continue his trade so well begone, as also to feed the hope and
show of his future virtue, he was admitted Dom Diego made knight
the next morning into the order of knigthode, invested with the collar of
saint Andrewe and other ceremonies of spain, by the hand of the said
Philipp, who after he had fulfilled the date of his above at Barcelonia,
pursewed his journey toward Castile leauyng our new knight Dom Diego
reioysinge not a little in his present honor, ymparted unto him by his prince,
retiring with the news of his good fortune to his own possession and living,
more to perform tharrerages of his duty to his mother, whom the hadd not seen
of long time, then with intent to make long stay there, or enter into
delight with the pleasures yt be in the country, whereof notwithstanding he
received so sewer a taste, that his captiuitye in the end exceded every way
in greatness of greff, the restrainte of liberty or other mislike or
impedimente he found at any time in the City, like as also the Poets have
ymagined that love, pitchinge his tents in deserte places not apt to
discouerye, does discharge his darts and arrows in the thicket of woddes and
forestes, upon the board of the Sea, or shaded fountains, and some time upon
the heighte of the highest hills in the pursewte of the Nymphs of all sorts,
iudginge thereby a liberty and most sewer way to treat upon matters of
love, without suspicion, Ielousye, envy, false reaporte, synister opinion or
common cry of the people, to be in the wide and open feldes, where they may
be bold to communicate their mutual passion without fear of witnesses,
enioyinge also the pleasures of all kind of chasses, which the champion does
norrishe, with participacion of the chirpinge harmony and natural music of
birds, and sometime the delitefull noise of sondrye pleasante channels and
silver streams, qualyfyinge in their kind the vehemency of their
languishinge greeffe, and recordinge also with great ceremony, the first
place of their amarus enteruiew or acquaintance, arguing thereby treble
felicity to such, as abandoning the sondrie annoyes attendynge continual
abode in the City, do resort to the pleasant lawndes in the country to yield
tribute of their studies to the muse, whereunto they be most affected, So Dom
Diego, being at hoame loved enterely of his mother, and served with all
dutiful obedience of his subjects and servants, after his ordinary hours
of study were passed, used his chief pleasure in thexercise of ye field, I
mean some time to dislodge the great and lofty heart, to dress the toiles to
entrapp the wild boar, and some time to try the goodness of his hawke with
the main winge of the hearon or fearful partridge in the stuble feldes or
valleys inuyroned with huge hills, wherein one day amongst the rest, hunting
the wild goat which he had forced from his habitation of the high and
craggie rocks, he saw launsing before him a heart which his dogs had rozed
and so hoatly purse wed, that (to his judgment) he seamed more then half
spente, wherewith, as well for the pleasure which the pastyme it self did
offer him, as also to ease the traueile of his howndes, he putt spurs to his
horse, forcinge him to a main gallopp, wherein he continued till, his hounds
loasynge the tracke of their pray, were at defalte, and him self without the
sight and hearing of all his men, with such ignorance of the cost where he
was, that he knew no ready way of return to his company, and much less
the place where his fortune had put him, greuynge most in this perplexity
that his horse being out of breath, refuced (for want of force) to carye him
any further, wherefore after he hadd blown diverse calls for his men without
other answer then an Echo of the woddes and waters, he divided his distress
into two points, the one to demounte and ease the wearines of his horse, the
other to retire back by the same path which brought him thither, wherein his
expectation was no less frustrate, then him self deceived by the malice of
his fortune, for that meaning to take the next way to his castle, he met with
a contrary pathe, which after he had traveled the most part of the
afternoon, brought him in the end, within the view of a stately house,
builded upon the side of a hill, which by certain marks appearinge on
thuttermoste parts of the house, albeit argued the contrary of his intent,
yet, hearing the babble of certain hunters, ymagininge the same to be his
people, drew near the place, which discovered (above his exspectacion) A
company of strangers, being certain servants of the mother of GENIVERA,
which attended their mistres with a brase of young greyhownds that had newlye
^^^^ne a hare to death, and being thus rencountred with this second
misfortune, he grew also into terms of greater destresse then before, for
that ^happroche of the night, beginning to expose shadoes of darkness upon
the earth by the departure of the son, took from him all hope of other harbor,
then the offer of some hollow tree, or green bed upon the ground, when lo
thauncient Lady discernynge between the view of her eye, and regardes of the
clouds, which hadd not yet cloased in the light of the firmamente, the
shadow of a man discendynge from the uppermost part of a hill with his horse
in his hand, seamynge by his majesty, marching with the semblance of a
prince, to be some degree of honor, sent one of her men to know what he was,
who reatorned with answer according to his demand, wheruppon the Lady
wydowe with her fair daughter, indifferently gladd of thapproche of their
neighbor, whom albeit they never saw, yet fame had made them partakers of
his virtue and renown, went in solemn order to mete him, forgetting no
kind of curteyse gretyng that belonged to the honor and estate of so noble a
personage, whereunto he replied with thanks according to the greatness of the
benefytt, with addition, that he found him self greatly in the favor of
fortune, for that his painful trauelle in wandryng so many hours, had given
him at last so fit an occasion, to visitt the house, whereunto, he doubted not
for his part, to confirm the league of frendshipp begone and happelye
continued of long time by his parents and predecessors: the Lady whose
long absence from the court had not diminished her grace in courtelike
conference, answered, that if they have greatest cause of contentements that
gains the most, or if large benefittes, require ample consideration, it is
she that ought to offer to fortune the sacrafize of thankesgeuinge, for that
she hadd brought her a guest, no less dear then the life of her self, and as
welcome as if the king of Spain had don her the honor to visytt her castle,
which sturred up in him a second offer of his service, not only on her
behalf, but also toward the least ymppe deryued of her house, wherewith,
Geniuera, to assiste the contentement of her mother in the company of the
young knighte, with the pleasure she took her self The first meting and
words between Diego and Geniuera.
in his semelye conference, craved (in smiling order) a participacion in
peculiar of the liberal offer which he exposed by general terms to her
mother and her whole house, DOMDIEGO which had not yet exceded an ordinary
regard in beholdynge the beautye of the young Lady, found cause in the
misterye of her words, to glaunce with more judgment upon her, in such
sort, that at the instant he felt him self assailed with such soddaine
alteration, that his astonishment would not give him leave to answer,
otherwise then with a percynge glee of his eyes, fedynge with firm
contemplation upon the fresh dye of white and red, appearinge in all parts of
her divine face, wherein also for a more decoracion of this wonderful work of
nature, thattire of her head presented A discriptio^ thatti^e and beautye of
Geniuera.
such an artificial devise, that it seamed she had (the same day) some fore
knowleage of the coming of him, whom her beautye made prisoner, and her
crueltye enjoined a most hard and long penance, for she had upon the
vttermoste part of her head, a call or coronet of gold resting upon a
wreath or garlande of flowers of sondrie coollors, pletted by curious sleighte
of the fingers within her enameled hairs, which covering one part of her
sholders, dispersed them selves also some time upon her delicate forehead,
and some time wafynge vnpon her roasye cheeks according to to the mylde
breathe of the evening wind which gave them mouynge, disposed them selves
with such seamelye grace, with increase to the beautye of her that ware them,
that who had seen the port and majesty which nature joined to this rare
work, would have judged that love and the three graces had, had no other
place of harbor but in this piece of wonderful perfection. At either of her
ears hong two fair and rich orient perles, which increased also the glee of
her golden hairs, besides the large and glistering forehead of this Nymphe,
whereupp on was set a border of rich dyamondes founded upon a frame of pure
gold, casting such pearcynge glymers to the beholders, that it presented
rather a rank or order of shynynge stars, when the elamente, in the heat of
the summer is most clear, exposynge beams of wonderful bryghtnes, then an
attire of a mortal creature, whereupon attended two sparklynge eyes assisted
on either side by an equal Simmetria or just proporcion with certain knottes
and borders of veins of the coolor of azure, with a special virtue to draw
and mortefie any heart made of the hardeste metal that ever was, yeldynge so
liberally their seruent beams, that who so disposed him self to
contemplacion of thies two twinklyng stars, was in no less danger to loase
the benefitt of his sight, then in times paste we read certain Philosophers
became blind upon the mount Olympium with continual regard of the son to
judge the dispacicion of the heavens: then appeared her delicate nose,
aunsweringe in proportion the rest of her face, deuidynge also her two chekes
of the coollor of a fine incarnatt, resembling two round aples come alredie
to the fulues of their maturitie, next to the which succeeded her courall
mouth, breathinge a perfume more precious and sweet, then any confection made
of the Amber, musk, or other droge aromatike coming out of ARABIA, and if
some time she chanced to disclose and open her lips, resemblyng in roundenes
and color two cheris in their full ripenes, excedyng also the softnes of any
thing that ever was accounted delicate or tender, there appeared two rawes of
perles of such rare whitenes, that thorient I say complayneth of want of
conning to make comparison with the coullor of her teethe, And so discending
some what lower, this Dyana discovered a neck, whose complexion gives cause
of shame to the whitnes of the glorius lilly, and makes blushe the pure
allablaster, her stomach also somewhat raised by two round and precius
dugbugges of equal separation, was covered with a brave and soft veil, more
tender then the thyn lawne, which hyndred no way the view of her trauellynge
breasts, panting and drawinge a pleasante breathe according to the motion of
thaffection which governed thinner parts of ye thoughts of this earthly
goddess, who besides all this, was assisted with a gift of such natural
beauty, bestowinge courteise regardes upon all men according to their
indifferent meritt, that the same made her no less worthy to be honored and
served of the greatest princes of the world, then the rarietie of her
perfection restored her a merueile and wonder to all men, which is a virtue
far from the most part of our fair dames, who glorienge in the glee of
their beauty) are moved I can not tell, with, what opinion of such disdain,
with desire to appear more perfect then is necessary, that in sekyng to set
a fairer enamel of that which nature has made sufficientlye precious, they
do not only impair the credit of renown by suborned means of ymperfection of
them selves, but also by their own follye deface the glory of that, which
sturreth up the chiefest cause of affection in men to do them honor and
service, wherein as my purposse is not to discover the doings of any in such
cases, so I hope this allegation of a troth in couarte manner, will defend me
from the displeasures of such as find them selves infected with the humor of
that folly, wherewith, in preferryng my integretie, I wish them all as
worthy, as they are desierous to wear the badge of glorious beauty, and so
to Dom Diego whom I think you will judge had sufficient cause of
astonishement, being so valyantlye assailed) without thinking of such an
assalte) with so strong an army, as the beauty behavior, and princely shapp
of this fair ympp and veraye nestcockle of nature, eye I think that the most
sparynge pilgrym that ever undertook to mortefye his body with painful
travel in devotion to any saint* would have renounced his vow, and cast a
way both skripp and staff, to have done honor to so fair an obiecte as the
beauty of this nymphe, and I doubt whether she most assured and staide
Philosopher of old time would have made any conscience to forsake his
profession of contemplacion of natural things, with judgment of
thelamentes, to have disposed him self and skill to the service of so rare a
perfection, I think also that if the daughter of Mynos hadd been favored with
semblable beauty, and blyssed with equal gifts and grace of this Lady, that
her Hipolites would have left the ship and dogs of Dyana to have pursued
the quest of so diuiue a misterye as appeared in all parts of this Geniuera
La^blonde, who for her part also was indifferently amazed, and no less
astonished with the port and courtelike behavior of the knight, then he moved
to scilence with the view of her beauty, wherewith also casting upon him
Geniuera fall leth in love with Diego.
certain regardes at unawares, began to feel a motion of that wherein she hadd
not been earste experienced, with an alteration in her heart, which forced a
change of complexion in her face, with a soddayne scilence for want of
audacitie to speak: an ordynarie custom to such as be strycken with the
disease of love, to loase the use of the ^ounge, when it should chyefly ease
the greeff of the heart, who not hable to supporte the heavy burden of
passions procedynge of that evil, does ymparte the greatest charge to the
eyes, as to the faithful messengers of the secrett conceptions of the mind,
which passioned above his force, and pressed with thalarams of affection, is
driven for the most part to force a vente or issue for the humor of his
desire by the same mean and ministers, which first discovered the rage of
his fever, whereof there seamed alredie a Sympathia or equality between the
two younglinges, being both indifferently ignorante of the mystery or cause
of such soddaine transmutacion, which also grew to terms of aggrauacion in
them both, by a renouacion of their gretyngs and enterteinementes at their
arrival at the castle, the same serving as fresh baytes to increase their
desire, having notwithstanding chiefeste power on the behalf of the knighte,
who losyng at this first meting the liberty of his thoughts, becam by little
and little so rauissed of his senses, and drowned in the poisoned podle of love,
that he took no other pleasure then in the conceyte of the gracious martirdom
he endured in the secrett ymaginacion of the beauty of his fair Geniuera:
here you may see the knighte who in the morning was the master of him self,
and in full possession of his senses, is now so transformed into a contrary
disposicion, that his willing bondage and state of present captivity, is not
only more pleasante unto him, then the benefitt of his ancient liberty dear,
but also kept him so long from the use of his former fredome, that in the
end he took no felicity if not in wyshynge to enjoy the other world, which
for the most part are the fruits of this folly, who seelynge the senses of
man, does drive him head long (with his eyes cloased) into the golphe Love
procedes of a fond opynion.
of miserable despair: and as love procedes no other ways then of a fond
opynion, so the purgatory of such as be afflicted therewith, comes only by a
foolyshe perswacion, that they be forsaken or deceived in the thing which they
honor so much, where, of the contrary part, if they would be indifferente
between their passion, and his vale we, they would not so rashelye make more
account of the thing which torments them, then of their health, honor
and life, exposed al to the service and appetit of her, who, disdainyng
peradventure their endeavor, return the meede of their merit, upon a stranger
and yeldes the pray to an other, for the which he has taken such pain,
whereby he takes occasyon of absolute despair, delitynge in nothing but the
perentory end of his unhappy life.

whileste supper was making ready, the lady mother dispatched certain of
her people to seek the servants of Dom Diego, whereof some had in charge to
reaporte his being there to his mother, who for her part was no less glad,
then she had cause, chiefly for that the distress of her son brought him in
the end to so good an hostess, as her neighbor, and only trende of the
world, in which mean while the stranger was desiered to supply the best
place at the table, over against whom, was appointed the match that first
set his heart on fire, and in place to perform the exspectacion of his
hostess in tasting the sondrie delicate meats she had prepared for him, he
fed only upon the dishes of love, and contenting himself with the dyot of his
eyes, who without* either let or Ielowsie, ymparted their norriture to the
heart, roued now and then by secret glaunces and percing regards to the tender
stomach of the fair Geniuera, who for her part also was no nigarde to requite
him with treble vserye, of famyliar glee, which restored such fresh alarams to
his late desire, that thalteracions he felt in himself made him blushe at
his own behauior, and as duringe the time of supper he was indiffrently
feasted with delicate brothes prepared by the mother, and famyliar signs sent
unto him by the eyes of her daughter, so he felt himself doble passioned, both
to conster the meaning of such regardes, and also to dym the sight of tholde
lady, for discerning the conueigh of their folly, wherein albeit as well to
cast a miste before the eyes of her mother, as to dissemble the desire of his
mind, he bestowed his looks inconstantly here and there abowte all the parts
of the table, yet cold he not use such sleighte in this simple shifte, but
his eyes took always their last farewell upon the place and person of his
mistres, in whom he found so thankful a reatorne, with amarus tribute, that
in the end he durst not behold her any more, for fear her beauty would bear
aue him of the benefit and sight of his eyes, all which were but prepratiues
to the part he had yet to play, into the which he began to enter the same
night, when after supper and the banquet performed, he had given the Bonsoir to
his hostess and her fair daughter, who for a more show of his welcome (or
rather a declaracion of her zeal, but chiefly to leave him occasyon of further
tormente, would not depart his chamber till she saw him in bed, where in
place of sleep, and to restore his wearye body with the course of natural
rest, he began to sighe, and build castles in Spain, preferringe in his mind,
thymages of a thousand fancies and follies, such as are appointed to appear
and torment them as have their brain weakened with vain cogitacions.

Alas (says he) is it possible that I which so long have enjoyed the benefitt
of a pleasante liberty, should thus lightlye Dom diego passioned with love.
yield to the first sommance and apprehention of a servile thraldom? which
albeit I cannot express in propper terms yet my mind feleth an experience
and effect of his force? is this the desert of my former fredom or just hier
of wa^ton inclynacion, if such hard tribute attend mine aunciente quiet, what
exspectacio^ of other felicity is there in the course of our young years, then
for a short time of flattering delites in liberty, to be rewarded in the end
with an interest of treble torments in bondage? have I thus long kept war
with thennemye of my free privilege, and reserved the maydenhead of my
affection, to fall thus into the danger of a captivity, where I dowt no less
whether my offer wylbe receined, the^ despair, to be entreated according to the
justice of my merit? Ah Geniuera, god forbid that thy beauty have power to send
so many torments and punishments to my yielded heart, as the tree, whereupon thou
take thy name, has pricks to anoye them that touch it, and bitter in
disgestion to such as make a taste of the Iewse, Ah paragon and only praise of
beauty, sewerly the fearful hare which thy dogs tare in pieces before thy
face this eueninge, was not more martired by the bloody Jaws of thy
greyhoundes, then my heart is tormented and divided into dyuersatie of opynions
upon the affection which I bear the, wherein alas as I know not whether
thou will admit me worthy of they service, or have already paste a grant of
thy love to an other, more worthy of favor then the loyal Dom Diego, So yet I
may be bold to vaunte upon this ympossibilitie. that no man is hable to
approach thunfayned sinceritye of my heart, determined rather to give place to
the sentence of my death, then to dysmysse the least part of the duty I have
vowed to thy beauty, whole outward show promises an inward virtue, that I
cannot despair to possess in the end the due meede of my loyalty, til which
time I will pray only upon the food of exspectacion, with assured intent,
for my part, not only to abandon all other ympressions or desiers, but such
as shall seame to favor the honor and service I have already sworn, but also
to endeavor by extreme diligence to make my self worthy of the goodwill of the
fairest Lady (that this day is shrewded) under the globe or circuit of heaven:
wherwyth after he had consumed certain ho wers in reauyng and raginge upon
his amarus complot, and that he had sufficiently sweet at the brows with the
force and vehemencye of his passion, he found the chiefeste medecyn for
moderacion of his grief, to communicate unto her the points of his good will,
with desyer he had not only to serve her, but also from henseforth to accept in
good part such sentence, as she shall think good to pronounce of his life or
death, and to do nor say any thing, but such as shall be awarded him by the
dome of the fair Geniuera, who for her part also was not void of passion nor
dispensed from semblable tormente, for offering to perform the ceremonies of
the night, she was demed to close her eyes and yet knew not Sleep the
ceremonies of the night.
the cause that hindered the course of sleep, by which means, making a
laborinth of her rich and fair feldbed, she was no less assailed with
contrariety of conceits, then her languishing servant, wherefore finding the
burden of affection to excede the grenes of her years, not yet assisted with any
discrecion or experience in love, dytermined to allow the resolucion of the
knight, if he ymparted the same either by subtle signs or secret conference.

This was thexercise of that night of both the lovers equal in desire, and
yet the one ignorant of the others greffe, wastinge indifferently in sighs and
wishes, as apprentises of the thing, wherein those that begin be always most
hot, and such as continue gain skill by long practice, and yet the best
experienced of al, are void of resistance against such an evil, and lack
government in the conueigh of so hurtful a case.

The morninge had no sooner discovered her glorious beams, and the messe^ger of
the son somoned the loathsome night to retire, but the weary knight left his
restles bed, with intent to take leave of his hostess, and challenge the
skoape of the larg feldes, to record and enterteine his amarus thoughts, in
retorning to his mothers house, wherein notwithstanding he found a stay of his
meaning by the honest ymportunitie of tholde lady, who with more entreaty then
was needful to so willing a gueste, won him easily to determyn his taryenge
till dynner, till which time, he found a supplye of exercise with her
company, and conference of her daughter, in whom he saw contynual cause to
aggrauat his affection, and doble occasion to increase his desire, in such
sort, as his astonyed countenance, and broken aunsweres, ymporting most often
the contrary of their demands, showed sufficiently ye troble and war in his
mind, which albeit ye subtle Geniuera, co^strued according to a troth, yet her
simple mother imputed it to an honest shame and want of audacitie in ye
gentleman, for yt he had not much haunted ye company of ladies, wherein as they
spente the most part of the morning, without (notwithstanding) that Dom Diego,
had the heart to discover the least part of his promise of ye night, so yt
hour of dinner so^moned them to break their discourse and perform ye due to
thappetit of nature, with such delicate and sumpteouse fare as the good lady
had provided, in declaracion of ye hearty zeal she bare to her guest, who
after dinner failed not in humble sort to be thankful to his hosts, with
assurance that, albeit he was not hable to requite her curtesse with equal
consideracion, yet his goodwill at all times should be nothing inferior to the
greatness of her merit, wherewith he addressed the rest of his duty to her
daughter, whose beauty (as you see) had made so great a wound in his heart,
that the remembrance remained till the last hour of his life, and as he kissed
her hand with intent to decipher that which he had ymagined all the night, he
became so amazed with thympedimente he felt in his tongue, with strange
diuersatie in all his senses, that he seamed no less ashamed of his present
weakness in that place, then before he was fully resolved to discharge there
solucion and meaning of his heart, which albeit gave some cause of little
astonishment to the young Lady, yet she found indifferente occasion of
pleasure and pity in his passion, for that as ye one proceeded by her means,
so she felt a motion in conscience to expose the other for the relefe of him
who suffered for her sake, wherefore with a trobled regard tempered with
sufficient arguments of affection on her behalf, she brake his dome trance
with these words, I wish sir (says she) that you might find as much pleasure
in your passion, as the same has ymparted equal grief to others, and that
your future absence may pinche you with no less annoye, then your present
departure leaves me desyerus to enjoy a longer time of your presence, which
philosophye not looked for of the knight, did not only dismysse his scilence and
untie the charm of his tongue, but also renforced him to an audacitie to yield
her thanks for the compassion she used to his distres, with addicion that
only he was happy above all the world, to be partaker of so liberal a wish,
but chiefly to hear her in terms of desire touching his presence, which
with his life and all that he had he bound there by oath, to be priest at all
hours to perform the recucion of her commandment, whereunto she replied
with thanks according to the affection that governed her, with request
eftsoon (and that with a reciprocal look and soft sighe) not to forget
hereafter the way to the castle of her mother, to whom (she assured him) the
welcomest gueste of the world, and for her part, she accounted it a felicitye
to participate in her pleasure, and keep in entier the league of frendshipp,
where with heretofore both their houses have been blissed from the beginning,
where with time, with the number of assistantes, witnessing their glee, forced
an abridgement of their farewell, contrary albeit to both their wills, the one
retirynge to her chamber, with more care and less quiet then before, and the
other, with a thousand hamours in his head, took his way to the house of his
mother, to whom he ymparted his adventure, his distres, being left of his men
in a place unknown, his horse overcome with extreme travel, and that which
worste was, thapproche of night, and his despair to find harbor, when not
withsta^dyng he chanced upon the castle of the old Lady, of whose courtesy
and beautye of her daughter he made a particular discourse, leaving out
notwitstandynge, the glee between Geniuerae and him, with request that it
would please her, to join with him in some honest mean of thankful
consideration to them both, whereunto he found his mother no less ready in
consent, then him self desyerous to use expedicion in theffecte, so that with
her advise, the platt was made to inuit them to her house the weke
followynge, and that he alone should work theffect, like as he found
himself most charged with the dett of their courtesy, and desyer to requite
it, whereunto he added such diligence, that upon his letter and humble
request, he got the consent of the mother and daughter, which both failed
not of their promiss at the day appointed.

When Dom Diego (having for the nonste the assistaunce of all the gentlemen
and gentlewomen his neghbours) forgatt Geniuera and her mother, at the house of
Diego.

of dyot, whereof there was more then sufficient, choice of music and melody
of all sorts, masks momries, triumphs and other offices of humanity,
wherein it behooved him chieflye to show a singler de^leritie, as well for the
discarg of every man's eye and exspectatio^, touching a show of his gifts,
being norrished and brought, up amongste princes, and also for the desyer he
had to leave no honor unperformed in the company of her, who had already the
whole possession of his liberty.

I need not discriue by piece meal thapparell of the feast, the diuersitye and
change of their dyot, their delicate banquetes, nor the sondrye sorts of
sweet wynes, it may suffice, that after dynner they descended into a great
hall, ready trymmed for the purpose, where the daunces began according to the
stroke of a sweet and soft music, shrouded under a veil or canapie of arrais
in the vppermoste part of the hall, there every gentleman took his Lady,
amongeste whom Dom Diego was not forgetful to address him toward his
mistres, no less gladd of her happy encounter, then he content to be so
near the cause of his pleasante tormente and insupportable passion of mind,
whereof he began even now to make some discouerye by words in this sort.
Like as (good madam) I have always Diego vvoeth Geniuera in a daunse.
thought that music has imported a secrett virtue, to force an appearance of
joy, in the most pynynge and solytary disposicion that is, Euenso I find
mine opinion confirmed by a present experience in my self, who earste
languishinge in panges of inward greeff, with detestation not only against
my self, but also all other things that offered any way to ease the greatness
of mine anoye, do feel now some moderation of my martirdom, as well by the
lamentable note of these records and insensible instruments, agreing with the
sorrowful condition of my present distress, as also, that by their conformity
and means, I find my self near unto her* who only has power to clear the
clouds of my mortal evil, and restore me to the calm of min ancient quiet
and as diverse diseases are not cured but by a medicen and obiecte of their
first occasion, so for my part, being contributor to the danger of that
extremity, I account you as justly bound to yield me compassion, as your
beauty is the chief and undoubted cause of thalteration which I can no longer
co^ceile from you and which forces me in thies few words, to vow unto you
(without condition of dissolution) such assurance of my service, that only
death shall have commission to corupte ye league which I seal here on your
behalf, by the faith and life of a knight, to be the only seruante, loyal
friend, (and if you accept thoffer) the lawful husband of ye fair Geniuera La
blonde: who for her part felt her self so assailed with the motions of
affection, that she could not continue so assured in her countenance, but
there appeared chaung of color, arguing indifferently a contentement of the
offer, and a pleasante mislike of his request, which rather gave him courage to
pursue the points of his purposse, then disiste or disclayme the hope of so
good a beginning, wherein as he forgot not to use thoffice of a good solicitor
for him self all that after dynner, so his ymportunitie at last, brought her
to pass a consent, and confirm the bale under thies terms: I am ignorante

for the frendshypp they find, I have cause of doble obligation, possessynge by

of your own diligence, which last words sturred up such present joy in
the passioned knighte, that what between the waves of sudden gladness
ouerflowinge all his parts, and hope of spedie redress by the consent of her
mother, he was skarce hable to pronounce a simple thanks, Albeyt kissynge her
white and delicate hand, in witness of the syngler pleasure he felt in the
breath of her words, told her, that, as her beauty and virtue deserved honor
of the greateste prince in Spain, so for his part, he only might glory in
the service of the mosts fair, courteyse and honest Lady, that ever was bredd
on that side the mountes, wherewith he was driven to cut of his further
discourse, by the approach of the messenger which was sent from the two Lady
mothers, to will them to comme to supper, where yfthere were any want of
curious deuyse at dynner, it was supplied with a double excess at this supper,
being served with such change and choice of strange dyott, that if it be
not syn to compare thabuses mortal, with divine mysteries, I think Jupiter and
the other gods were not so plentifully entreated upon the mount Peleon
celebratynge the marriage of the fair Thetis: albeit the end of the banquett
concluded with a resolution to renew thexercise of after dynner upon a fair
grene, environed with diverse borders and oderiferous herbs and ympes of the
earth, pauished above by artificial sleyghte, with certain laurel branches
and buddes of hathorne, to defend them from the parchynge heat of the
son, where they had also to assyste their pleasant recreations, the most
temperatt season of the day at the dedeclynyng of the son, the pleasante
huishyng of a clear stream discendynge from the top of a mountain, the
chirpyn hermonye of the feelden birds, assembled (as it were only to
increase their solace) and also the soft and sweet accord of the grene bows
or young sprayes, mouinge at the whistle of the mild ZEPHIR, where as they
divided them selves into diverse change of pastimes, some to weaue garlandes
of flowers for their servants, some to run and leap, or expose other
exploites of actiuitie for the honor of his mistres, and other to try the
maystery of main force by casting the sledge or heavy bar, So amongst them
all there was one Dom Roderyco a near neighbor and most famylar to thamarus
Diego, who perceiving by the secrett messengers of the eye, which passed
between him and his mistres by stelthe, to what saint he would gladly offer
his candell, and how desirous she was to admit his devotion: furthered
thintentes of them both so farfurthe, that he took by the hand a young
gentlewoman sittinge next to the fair Geniuera to begin a new dance,
whereunto as she was nothing unwilling, so Dom Diego took courage also to
address him self to his mistres, whose example the whole trowpe of nobility
followed with indifferente contentacion, and for the more honor of the dance
Seigneur Roderico, who was the first in the round, gave charge offcilence to
the musicions, having conferred affore with his gentlewoman to sing some
solemn note upon the subject of the two amarus, wherein she performed so
indifferently the praise and passion of them both, that a man would have
judged she hadd entered into the heart of Dom Diego and been specially
instructed of the fair Geniuera, who seeing her self touched at the quick and
pinched without laughinge in the hearing of so many, but chiefly exalted to
the skies in the presence of him who took no less pleasure in her praises,
then if he hadd been presented with the Seigneury of all Aragon, cold not so
connynglie dissemble her contentement, but thalteracion of her mind appeared in
the often change of complexion in her face, which as it increased the cristal
die and excellency of her beauty, So Dom Diego construyng that passion to his
commodity, gave judgment of thassurance of her good will, whereof for a further
prooff be wrong her tender fyngers, and with a smylyng regard, askinge her
opynion of the song, wished that her seruante might live to see
thaccomplishment of such a prophecy, protesting withal, that in his life he
had not hard Music of more delight, for the which (says he) I acknowledge a
dett to the gentlewoman, that so aptly has discovered your good will toward
me, and vowed so frankelie on your behalf, my loyal service, which I will not
forgett to confirm in all that I may, even until the last dropp of my blood,
whereunto Geniuera replied with a doble usury of humble thanks, with request
that he would reapose undoubted creditt in the mystery of the song, which as
it had rightlye deciphered the determynation of her mind, and unfolded that
which she reserved only as secrett in her self, so she would not for her
part, forget to perform theffect, when convenient time, with her mothers
consent, would admit the lawful consummacion, upon which last words
attended such friendly glaunces and wanton regardes of the eye, with a
cou^terchaunge of semblable glee on his part, that the two Lady widows, did
not only note their affections, but also give judgment of the conclucion and
unity of their minds, with resolution (for their parts) to confirm the
bargain, with thassista^ce of time, using as then but only a simple conference
deferring the final effect by reason of the tender years and grene youth of
both the lovers, whom if the discretion of the mothers at that instante, hadd
conjoined by the oath of marriage, they hadd prevented the malice of an
unconstant fortune, who in all delays forgettes not to play the ordynary
rolet of her natural mobility, whereof she exposed a manifest effect in ye
persons of thies two ancient widows, one having lost her son for twenty or
xxij. months without hope ettesones to recover his presence, by a cruelty and
rash conceit of the daughter of the other, who (without the special
providence of God) hadd given such a false bound to her honor, that the
simple remembrance was sufficient to dispatche the old years of her mother
with an untimely sommonee to discende to her fatal grave.

And now during this amarous practice between thyes two prentises in love,
whose affection growing to a feruentnes with an indifferent desire in them both,
presented arguments of equal alteration in the persons of the one and the
other, for Dom Diego retiring by little and little from the lively hew of his
former complexion, seamed transformed in amoment, neither did he allow any
pleasure, but that which he possessed by the presence of his Geniuera, who also
for her part, judged ye whole felicity of the earth to consiste in the parson
of her servant, whom she accounted the only pattern for perfection, of all the
gentlemen of his time, neither did he let slip any weke, wherein he went not to
do his duty to his mistres three or four times, in whom he found a reatorne
of his courtesy, with such virtuous and honest consideration as was convenient
in a maid careful of the guard of her honor, wherein albeit her mother,
reaposyng indifferent credit in the virtue of them both, gave leave to her
daughter to keep him company, yet (as Aristotle affirms) honesty does not
broke long dalliance, or wanton chatt in chaste maids with the first that
accoasteth them with conference in corners with any but such as by consent of
the church have got the power and possession of their body and is or ought
to be the one half or moytie of their mind, which albeit was thintente and
desire of these two lovers, yet ye simplicity of their friends, deferring
theffect, wrought not only a breach of ye bargain, but also sturred up in her,
an humor of mortal spite against the sincerity of her loyal servant; who
endewred ye revenge of her unjust anger, under a punishment of a most sharp and
long penance in deserts inhabitable and unknown, for in ye heat of this
reciprocal love between thies younglings, it chanced yt a meruellous fair and
goodly gentle woman, daughter of a great lord of the country called Forrando
de la Sara, vsyng familiarly the company of Geniuera, becam by that means
extremely in love with Dom Diego, assayinge by public and private means to
imparte unto him what power and authority she would willingly give him over
her heart, if for his part, he would requite the sincerity of her love with
semblable honor and affection, wherein experiencynge the benefytt of all honest
means seamyng any way to favor the effect of her desyer, considered at
last, that, above all other exercises, the knight took greatest pleasure in
hawks, wherefore under coulor to make a breach into his favor with assistyng
the disposition of his delight, she sent him one day a tassell gentle) as the
chiefeste Jewel she had to present him withal, except the offer of her own
good will, wherein Dom Diego albeit he was wholly possessed by an other, and
with the loss of his liberty, hadd also so departed wit his judgment, that
he could not discern thintente and honest zeal of the gentlewoman, yet he
accepted her present and returned the messenger with such thanks as
appertayned.

In the receiving of this hawke, appeared absolute shows of the evil fortune
of the pore Diego, which immediately failed not to thunder upon him without
compassion, for as he went often to visitt his mystres, so he forgott not
continually to carry this hawke upon his fiste, boastinge so far upon the
goodness of the bird, that he chanced in her presence to say that it was one
of the things in the world he held most dear.

Sewerly this words were sifted more nerely then there was cause, and
construed to other end, then he mente them, saying that certain days after in
his absence, devising upon his sundry virtues, some commended his honest and
curteus behauior, some gave praise to his valyauntnes and dexterity in arms,
some exalted in him the sondrye gifts of nature, and passing further, he was
generallye preferred of all the company for his sincerity and constant
dealing in matters of love; saving of one Graciano, who rather enuyinge the
virtue of the knight by malice, then hable to deface ye least of his gifts by
reason, joined with the rest in commendacion of his personage, actiuitie and
other dowries of nature, but for his faith or care of promiss where loyaltye
should most appear, I account him (says he) so apt to dissemble, and
inconstante by nature, that he uses no difference of persons in grounding
his affections, making no conscience to seame to languishe mortallye, where he
means nothing less then firm constancy, which touched Geniuera so near,
that she could not give place any longer to the sinister babble of Graciano,
desieringe him to use other terms touching the honesty of Dom Diego, for
(says she) I am of opinion that he will rather pass under the sentence of any
death, then forfeyt the least point of his promise passed already under the
seal of his faith to a gentlewoman of this country, besides his love (I know
is so sincere and upright) that I dare pawn my lif on ye behalf of
thassura^ce. There is the miste that dimmeth your eyes, says this cankarde
enemy of Diego, for under the veil of a perjured loyalty, he abuses the
simplicity of honest Ladies, whereof I need not go far for a prooff, nor you
doubt much of the misterye, if you conferr the circumsta^ce of his former
profession toward you, with the present* league of friend shipp between him
and the daughter of Dom ferrando de la Sara, confirmed alredye by the gift of
a tassell gentle, which for her sake he estemeth above all the things in the
world, which last allegatio^ restoring a remembrance of the words, pronounced
not long ago by the knight touching the dear account he made of his hawke,
began to bread a suspicion of his constancy, and an assured creditt in the
information Geniuera falls i^ disdain with Diego.
of thunhappie Graciano, wherein swelling immediately with her unjust collor
incensed by a simple and cold Ielowsie, was forced to abandon the place, and
retire into her chamber, where she gave such skoape to her synister conceit,
that she was upon terms many times to use force against her self,
whereunto she had added present dispatche, if a hope to procure in time the
revenge of the wrong, which she persuaded to have received of her Diego, had
not staide thexecution, albeit she could not so govern her malicious
disposition, but the deadly hate conceived in this moment against thinnocente
gentleman, did not only supplante both stock and root of aunciente zeal on
her part, but also grew to such mortality in her venomous stomach, that she
seamed not to delight so much in the use of her own life, as in desyer to take
pleasure in the remembrance of the death of him, who no less innocent in the
cause, then ignorante of the grudge, came the next morning (as he was wont)
to see her, having upon his fiste (by evil fortune) the bird which bredd
first this mortal Ielowzye: And as he satt deuisyng with her mother, fyndinge
a want of thaccustomed company of his mistres, he asked where she was,
whereunto he was answered by one of her women, that as soon as she saw him
enter the house, she took her chamber, all which he dissimuled by his wisdom,
imagininge the same to proceed of some wanton fancy or coye conceit,
whereunto the most part of women are commonly incident, so that when he saw
his time, he took leave of her mother and departed, meting by chance as he
went down the steares of the hall, one of the chambrieres or Gentlewomen of
Geniuera, who^ he requested to kiss the hand of his mistres on his behalf,
which she promised to perform, hopinge to do a thing no less acceptable to
her mistres, then to gain thanks of him on whose behalf she presented the
courtesy.

Albeit, as it is to be thought that Geniuera enjoyed little quiet and less
contentemente in this mean while, solicited, I can not tell, by what desyer to
defye whollye the remembrance of Diego, wherein she was the rather forthered by
an information, that he bare still the tarssell of his fyste, which she judged
to be done only in despite of her, So when her woman offered to present
thimbassage of the knighte, she fell into such terms of frenzy, that the
simple brute or name of Dom Diego sturred up such heinous alterations within
her, that to her former wroth, was added a present wodnes, in such sort, that
she seamed for the time to labor indifferently between thextreme panges of
death, and use of longer lif, albeit restored at last by the great diligence
of her woman, she could not so wholly dismiss her fury, but she imparted the
passion of her anger to her eyes, who after they had some what eased her
inward greef by a number of dollorous tears, put her e^tesones in the
possession of her former speech, which she witnessed in these exclamations.
Geniuera exclaimeth against Diego.


Ah traitor and disloyal knighte, unworthy every way to participat with the
breathe of the common air, and no less meritorious of the honor or bare title
of knighthodde: has the constant and honest love I have borne the, deserved
this unhonest recompense? is it a virtue to pretend loyaltye under a masqued
vyserne of detestable deceit? if these be the fruits of thy faith, purifyed
through so many oaths? what exspectatio^ of assurance is there in the promise
of any man? Is it I that must feel the stynge of thy infectio^? What cause have
I given the to imagine the spoil of mine honor, and imparte the pray to an
other unworthy every way of just comparison to me? If not in loving the more
then was convenient to thy inconstante and dissemblinge disposition, I have
embased mine honor to advance thy renown, how could thou without blushing
attempt the offer of my good will, having thy conscience poysened with so many
spotes of abominable traison? how dareste thou present me the baise les
^ains by the mouth of a messenger, saying thy whole body is alredie vowed to
the service of an other? no, no, saying God has reueiled the unto me before thy
villanye put effect to the ruin of mine honor, I doubt not only to defend
me hereafter from the force of thy deceitful charms, but also swear unto the
by the eternal majesty of the higheste, that albeit force makes me the
treasores of thye wickedness, yet assure thy self from hensfurth at my hands
of such favor, as thou may exspect of the most mortal enemy thou have in the
world, wherewith to give the last farewell to the pore Diego, she writ ymediatly
certain lines and delivered them sealed to her page, with commissyon, that
the next day he should meet the knight on the way coming thither, and
deliver the letter, with Instruction besides, that affore he came to the
house, he should read the contents and perform the effect, whereof the
page (being made to the string) failed not of any point, for the next day he
met Dom Diego, a quarter of a league from the house, presentynge him the
letter with his commission by mouth, who kissinge the paper of his mistres in
honor of her that sent it, opened the packet and found that which follows.

Albeit the coutynuall complaynt of my greeffe ymportes no dispense of my
dollor, yet in exclayming against the wrong Geniuera reprocheth Diego by a
letter.
thou haste don me, I shall so desypher thy villanye, that the whole world shall
find cause, not only to proclayme open shame upon the, but also (by my
misfortune) beware of thin fections of thy detestable traison, whereunto if I
have added more credit then there was cause on thy side, the remembrance of that
which is past, (preferring a contynuall view of thy perjured trothe) is to
defend me hereafter from the offer of semblable peril, neither will I live
hensfurthe in fear of future evil, or stand in awe eftsoon to be infected by
the, for that I have not only banished the remembrance of Diego out of every
corner of my mind, but also am of intent to perform such vengance and
punishmente of my self, that if I feel any vain, member or other part in me,
bente never so little to favor the or sewe for grace on thy be half, to use no
less cruelty in tearinge the same from the rest, then thy disloyalty has
sturred up such just cause of unseemly tyranny in me. And for thy part (O
perjured knight) since it is thy only trade to beat every bushe where thou
thinkeste to be either bird or neste, goo pitche thy nets where thou art
sewer of pray, and bait thy hooks with terms of deceit to entrapp her,
whose late present is of more force with the, then the honest and chaste love
which virtue began in us both, for seeing abirde has made yt more light then
the wind that supportes her in the air, God forbid that Geniuera, either
admit thy excuses or allow thy iustifycacion, and much less wish the other
good, then to see the torn in pieces; with the most extreme torments that
ever martired any traitor, which is the last favor thou have to hope for of
me, who lives not but to work the spite above any enemy thou have in the
world. Geniuera la blonde

He had no sooner redd these sorrowful news, but liftynge his eyes to heaven he
called God to witness of his innocencye, who only being priuye to thynteggretie
of his mind, cold also iustefye his loyal meaning toward her who unjustly
abused the sincere virtue of his immovable affection, and as he meant there to
prefer some discourse^n his purgacion, the page, who was not so amply
instructed of his mistres, as mortal enemy to Dom Diego, staide thintente of
his meaning by the reaporte of that which he had in charge by mouth, saying
that he cold do no greater pleasure to Geniuera, then to shon all places of
her repair, seeing (says he) that as the frendshipp you have vowed to the
daughter of the Lord Sero, has discovered your untroth toward her So she
has given judgment against your virtue for fedyng two simple gentlewomen
indifferently with the food of one uncertain hope, wherewith he departed
leauinge the knight in less care then affore, for that conferringe her
grudge with the cause, he thought the small occasion founded also upon an
vntrothe, would in short time take away the force of her collor, albeit he
cold not so wholly dismiss the remembrance of her displeasure, nor govern
his own passion, but retorning to his castle above an ordynary pase, went to
his chamber, where pulling the poor hawke from the pearche, committed her
presentlye to a thousand morsels, and cursing her that sent her, with his own
folly in receiving so vile a thing (enchaunted as he thought, by some furye
or magical charm) determined ymediatlye to present his mistres with the
sacrafize of thoccasion of her unjust anger, with intent to perform nolesse
of his own body, if she would not give place to her displeasure upon his
honest purgacion, which with the dead hawke he sent by a trusty seruante of
his, debated at large in a letter, wherein after a number of just reasons to
confute her unjust objections, touching lightly her rash judgment in g^uyng
sentence of his vntrothe, without hearing his iustifycation he preferred
certain humble means for moderacion of her displeasure, onelesse she reaposed
felicity to see him consumed in the martirdom of apyning life, or dilited in
the news of his present death, with other instructo^s which he gave the
messenger but chiefly to note the contenance of his mistres, and make faithful
reaport of every point of her answer, wherewith the messinger posteth to
Geniuera, to whom with all humylitie he presents the charge of his commission,
albeit the passion of her fretting anger denied her patience to read the
letter, and much less would give her leave to accept the present, thunfayned
witness of the contrary of that which she to lightly believed, but charged the
messenger upon great pain to return with the tromperies he had brought,
and say unto his master, that she knew to well his whistle to come at his
call, and being lately burned, she would take heed eftsoon to fall into the
fire, wherwyth albeit the servant went abowte to prefer thexcuse of his
master, yet the disdaynefull lady chokinge his honest intent, forced him to
unwilling scilence, with charge to ympart her resolucion to his master, whom
(says she) if I loved erst entyer lie, I hate now with a malice more then
mortal, where with she flonge out of the presence of the messenger, leaving
him no less amassed at her cruelty, then dowtefull to return to his
unfortunate master, whom he knew would skarcely be kept from the danger of
despair in hearing the sorrowful sommonce of his mistres: Albeit saying he
had professed to make a faithful reaporte, he returned not forgetting to
repete every point of that, which she had given him in charge, and withal
restored the letter and dead present unto the selly Diego, who at the same
instant, had given like end to his evil and life, if his man had not
withstanded thexecucion of his morderinge hands, albeit he cold not give
such ympedymente to the furye of his passion, but that it kept him occupied
with hideus groans, and doleful regardes the most part of the after none,
till at last he quallifyed thextremetye of this furye in complaining to him
self in this sort

Alas (says he) what judgment of fortune is this, The complaint of Diego.
that being at the point to reap the fruits of the content mente I wish in
the world, and feed of the only felycitie I have in this life, to be presented
with an extremity of more desperation then ever happened to any that bare the
name of infortunat? If such iniquity bear a swaighe in payinge the due hier
of the honest service of men, what hope hereafter may sustain the life of
faithful lovers? what exspectacion have they in the end of their travail,
when a Ielous envy has power not only to take the pray out of their hands,
but also ymparte the fruit of their hope to an other, not worthy any way to
participate with so glorious a merit. Ah Geniuera, if thy disdaynefull anger
would give the leave to make a view of my innocence, consider indifferentely
the circumsta^ce of my former love, with ymagynacio^ what assurance I have
hereafter vowed on thy behalf, so long as my body bears lif in this earthly
corruption, I know thou would repeal the sentence of thy former judgment,
correct the sinister instincte that sturred up the humor of thy cruelty, and
wype away at last the tears of my undeserved sorrow, with a frank offer of
that which I have deserved by justice.

Ah vain hope which hitherto haste flattered me with pills of joyful
disgestion, leaving me in the end to the mercy of a miserable despair? is it
I that must feel thoperacion of thy poison, and liccour of bitter taste? it
had been better for me to have been repulsed in the beginning, then after a
pleasant proof of reciprocal love, to be refused, and lose the earnest of my
desyer, for so small an occasion, yt the only remembrance makes me blushe at
the symplicitye of the cause, Albeit fortune shall not altogether tryumphe over
me, for so long as I live, so long will I keep my vow to the fair Geniuera,
and preserve my life only to witness the constante force of my love, which
albeit I can not perform with out an extreme torment in skorchinge flames of
contynuall passion, yet the remembrance of my duty to her to whom I offer this
devotion of a burninge sacrafyce of my self, will quallefye in some part the
heat of my skaldynge, greeffe: wherewith he retired into such sighs and
signs of lamentable dollor, showinge him indifferently plunged between the
Alarams of death, and panges of frenzy, that his man was at point to ronn for
the old lady, to come and bliss her son with her last farewell, Albeit
restoring his trance by his own diligence, began (so far as he durst) to
reprehend the weakness of his mind, for that he seamed so careless of him self,
as to offer his life at the sommonce of a folyshe girl, who (says he) uses
this cruel pollecie peradventure, to make a trial of your constancy, neither
ought you to do such wrong to your virtue, and much less keep war with
extremities, but if you be resolved to love her, you must also determyn to
pursewe her by other means, and giuinge a little place to the malice of
fortune, attend the benefit of a better time, who is never unthankful to
them that suffer her with patience, and who also has power to mollefye for
you this Dyamantyn heart of your mistres, albeit it be tempred with the mettell
and blood of the most furious and savage beasts that ever bredd in the
deserts of Lybya. Diego did not only allow thadmonicion of his man, but also
felt cause of comfort in his advise, with intent to persiste in the pursewte
of the good will of his misters, to who^ he preferred sondrie letters,
ambassages by mouth, and other excuses, wherein he gained as much as in the
first, for that the more he courted her with honest importunityes, the
greater grew her unjust displeasure, in such sort, that in the end, she
threatened the messenger with severe punishment, if he continued any longer
the queste of his masters follye, for (says she) these hands shall rather
give end to my life by a willing force against my self, then my heart
consent to be thankful in any sort to him, whom I hate no less then the
stinge of a venomous serpente, which as it brought a fresh supply of dollor to
the languishynge Diego tryeng to thuttermost the virtue of his patience, so
consideringe the little gain he should get in attendynge that which his
destynies hadd determined against him, and saying with all, he was void of
power to withdraw his affection, determined his reapose in the last refuge of

abhorringe notwithstanding to defyle his own hands with the blood of him
self, he resolved to attend his fatal dome in performyng the rest of his
pynynge days, in some deserte or solitary soil not inhabited but by the
savage society of wild beasts, whereunto he added such expedicion, that the
next day he caused to be made secretly two habittes or attires of pilgrims
for him self and one man, which he meant take to with him, with other
necessaries mete to furnishe such a voyage, the same night also he writ at
large to his cruel Geniuera, deliueryng the letter sealed in most sewer
manner, to one of his officers, to whom he would not imparte the mystery but
coloringe his pilgryms voyage with a Journey he said he hadd to make to one of
his friends, willed him to communicate no less to his mother, and that within
twentye days they should exspecte his return, for the rest says he, I
enjoin the upon the duty thou owe me, to deliver this letter, the fourth
day after my departure to the Lady Geniuera la blonde, who if she seame
disdainefull, mark only with what countenance she refuses it, wherewith he
dismissed him, and called the other which as you have hard performed always
the messages between him and his mistres, whom only he made privy to his
devise, and partaker of his cruel intent, which seamed so straung in
thopinion of his man, that what for the fowlenes of the fact, and special
care he had of the well doing of his master, he declared frankely his advise
in this sort: xs it not sufficie^te (sir) says he, that you give your self
in pray to the cruelty of your mistres His man dissuadeth him from the
pilgrims voyage
but also to increase her glory in sufferynge her cruelty to vanquishe your
virtue? are you so ignorant in the malice of women, that you can not discern
the delight they take to pafsion their poor servants, triu^phing chiefly in
the despair of such as they have unhappily made thrall to their beauty? you
ought to eschew the misery of that inconvenience, by thautoritie of the
wisemen in old time, who found such just cause of hate against that sect,
that they dowted not to term them the common ruin of men? wherein what
other thing moved the Greek Poet to pronounce his opinion in few words upon
the state of women, but that he knew the felicity of man to be greater in
shoninge thacquaintance of that fury, then in embrasynge the society of so
perentory an evil, saying (says he) they differ nothing in disposicion from
the serpente, who being delivered from the violence of the frost, and preserved
from present peril of death by the husband man, did yield him for recompense,
a mortal terror with his venomous hissing, and infected his whole house with a
stinking vapor, oh how happy is he that is the master of his affections, and
enioyenge the benefit of a pleasante liberty, has the gift to shon this
sweet evil, which so far (as I see) is the cause of your present despair,

resolucions attendes ordinary rebukes, and he that performs his affairs in

success, whose end is not conferred with the beginning, and guyded wholly by
the government of reason and virtue, for as upon virtuous entreprises,
attendes a fame of honor and renown, so the reward of wicked devises, is
infamye and sometime shameful death, and for your part (sir) let your
ancient wisdom encounter this femenyne miffortune, in making as little
account of your rebel mistres, as she is most unworthy to enjoy the least
favor of your nobility, which deserves a more honest consideration, then a
fare well of such tyranouse disposition, where with beholding some arguments
of anger in the face of his master, whom he feared to incense to thut
termoste, he knitt up with this resolution: seeing (says he) you are
determined in your mishap, I beseech you accept my service to accompany your
fatal guide, to the end I may participate with you in your fortune, till the
heavens, ceassing to wreake their malice upon you, do seame also contented to
dymisse the cruelty of your destynies, wherein as he performed the some of his
masters exspectacion, who defiered only the company of his man in the voyage
of his miserye, so after certain thanks for his goodwill, he told him that

pleasante thought of their delight, do awake with the heavenly harmonye and
charm of little birds, with assurance to enjoy theffect of that, which a
shadow or delitefull vision of the sprite presented them in the night sleping
in so great contentemente, where I (unhappy that I am) most cruelly attended
upon with a contrary destenie, and in place to enjoy a simple benefytt or
privilege of that which all other have in common, am forced, to wander when
all creatures are admitted to rest, having only thaire of deserts and lawnes
vninhabitable to record thecco of my sorrows, and the feloweship of wild
bestes to assiste the tunes of my complaints? Ah Venus whose star heretofore
has only guyded me, and whose beams, of long, have taken root in my heart?
what cause have I to complain of thy injustice, which yeldes me falsehood for
faith, and tormente for true constancy of mind? if this be the hier of
loyalty, why beareste thou the title of just? the penance I endure
discharges the of the name of merciful, or if thou deal so seuerly with thy
true serseruantes? Why kepest thou the course amongst the orient planettes of
the heaven? Albeit if I abuselthy honor in blasphemyng the majesty of thy
godheade, I sewe for no favor, saying I feel alredye the full weighte of thy
heavy hand, neither haste thou any punishment in store, whereof I taste not

thinfluence of the starr which governs me, dispatche at once the messenger
of thy determinacion, to the end that by my death, my distress may receive
end, and my cruel mistres perform her glorious triumph in the victory of
my pynynge life: His complaints could not so stay the swifte course of time,
but or he was ware, the heighte of the son showed the declining of the day,
which moved him to increase his pase, leaving the common ways, to follow the
paths least acquainted with traueile, wherein they continued without
intermission till the cloasinge of the euenyng: when the wearynes of their
horses forced them to descend, and take harbor within a little village far
from the ordinary way, from whence after some little releeff to their horses,
and less rest to them selves, they departed, wandering in that sort by the
space of three or four days and nights, the end whereof brought them at
last to the foot of a large mountain, inhabited only with savage beasts
and creatures unreasonable, discoueringe round about, a platt or soil of
pleasame prospecte, and most proper to shroode the solitary life of the
wandrynge knight, for if he delyted in the shade, he hadd there the benefytt
of a number of pleasante trees, which nature seamed to lend him as a special
solace in that wyldernes: When his sorrow desyered the use of a more open
prospecte, the plain forrestes and chases, with their wholle heardes of dear
of all fortes, offered to give him skoape to record his greeffe, and for
change of recreation, he might view there the hideus and high rocks, whose
steepnes and craggie situation, albeit moved a terror to the beholders, yet
were they not without cause of great delight, by reason of the pleasant grene,
garnished with the tappissery of diverse flowers, spreadyng them selves all a
onge the heighte of the said mountes, but that which moved most his
affection to that place, was a merueilous fair and rowmey cave, environed on
all sides with beeche, cypres, pyneaple and ceder trees, with other branches
yeldynge fruits of diverse kinds, right before the mouth or openyng of the
which, tendyng to the valley, appeared a number of pleasante graftes, whose
roots receiving moisture by a clear stream passing with soft noise all
alonge the door of the cave, gave such bountiful norryture to the twigges and
tender branches, that thonly topps bowed down and dipped them selves, as
upon duty, in a fountain of wonderful clearenes, fedyng continuallye the
said stream, all which seamed to offer such solace to the solytarye intent
of Diego, that without further advise he determined to perform there the
penance he went to do, and to convert that house, builded by nature, to the
monasterye of his profession, wherein he mente to end the voyage of his
deuocions, commandynge his man to alight, who vnsadlinge their horses, gave
them the keye of the wild forestes, whereof hitherto they hard no news.

Touching their saddells, with the harness, and other furniture of their
horses, they bestowed within a little cell or corner in their cave, where also,
leaving their ordinarye apparel, they putt on their habittes of pilgrim, there
his man made provision according to the condition of their state, and
necessitye of the place, dyggynge for his first endeavor, certain soddes and
lomppes of claye wherewith he entrenched and rampierd their felden shopp, to
defend them against the furye of wild beasts, who otherwise might
oppress them in the night, he made also two beds or little couches of
soft moss with a testure and sides of wodde, which he hewde in no less fine
proporcion, then if the skill of the Carpenter had assisted the work. they
hadd no other releeffe or food for long time then of the fruit which the
wild trees did yield them, one less sometime, for a change of dyot, they
were gladd to feed of raw roots, which they dug out of thintrailles of
the earth, until extreme hunger preferred a mean to supply their thin
fare, which was, that his man made a crosbowe, with the which they killed
often times the hare and conie fedynge at releeff, some time they beguiled the
wild goat in the mountains, and were often the bane of a greater beast in
the forreste, whose blood they pressed between two pieces of wood, made for
the nonst, deuidynge them into morsells, which they roasted with the heatte of
the son, and so furnished, in sober manner, their lean table, disgestynge
their rude and unwholesome dyelt, with a cup of cold water, whereof they had
no less plentye, with no more charges, then, when they commanded over whole
cellers of delicate wine in the pallayes of Dom Diego, who increased the dweile
of his present miserye with tears of continual complainte, inueighynge
against the malice of his fortune, wherein he used as a common exercise, to
walk all alone in the most dangerous places of the deserts, enterteynyng
his solytarye thoughts, or rather of intent to offer him self a pray to the
Jaws of some Lion or Tygre or merciles bear discendynge from the mountains,
but the seruante-doubtynge the resolucion of his master, prevented theffecte
of desperation with his contynuall presence, exclamynge (as far as he durst)
against such vanities and acts of frennezie, wherein if by chance, he let
escape any word reprehendynge the crueltye or wrong don unto him by his
mystres, yt was a pastyme to see the alteration of Diego, srorminge against
the prelumptuouse audacitye in his man, in such sort, as continuinge
eftesones to accuse her discourtesie, he would not stike to threaten him so
far, that if it were not for the respect of the loyalty he hadd heretofore
found in him, he would make him feel* how near it tooched him at the heart,
to hear with patience, any blasphemy against her, who hadd no less right to
punish him in this sort, then he reason to endure the penance for her sake
without cause of just complaint against her severity, wherein as he showed
an undoubted experience of the contagius dispocision of love, for that such as
be infected with the corruption of that air, take no pleasure but to gull and
glutt their thirste with the brothe of that pestiferous poison, So if he had
ryghtlie measured his own meritt with the cause of his unjust torment, using
with all thaduise of reason, he had not seamed so simple in his own
blyndnes, nor been so sown abused by ye folly of a folish girl: his man
dowting any further tattempt him with perswacions, for fear to procure
thuttermost of his displeasure, was forced to an unwilling patience, greuinge
notwithstanding on the behalf of the misfortune of his master, who with his
evil dyott and worse lodgyng, quarrelyng both two with his former order of
bringing up, was become so pale and hideuse of regard, that he rather
resembled the dried bark of a withered tree, then the shapp of a man bearing
life, besides the course of continual tears, and skorchyng syghes, derived
from the bottom of his stomach, had so drained the conduites and veins
(fedynge the parts of his body) with natural moisture, that his eyes sonke
into his head, his bearde forked and grown out of order, the hears of his
headd staring like a forlorn man or one loathinge the use of longer life, his
skyn and face full of forrowes and wrinkelles, procedyng of ^retting thought,
argued him rather a wild man borne and bredde up all the days of his life in
the wilderness, then the valyante Diego, whose fame exceded earste the whole
compass and Circuit of Spain.

But here let us leave our amarus hermitt full of passions in his simple
cloister or cane under the earth, and see what followed the delivery of his
letters to his cruel Geniuera, to whom the seruante the fourth day after his
departure, according to his charge, presented the letters not with out a
great show of duty and reverence, who notwithstanding as soon as she
perceived by the direction from whence they came, forgatt not to retire into her
aunciente disdain, and casting (in great anger) the letters upon the ground,
vouche safed not once to give leave to the messenger to declare the rest of
his embassage, wherewith her mother some what reprehendyng thinciuilitie of her
daughter, demanded to see the packett, for (says she) I am persuaded of
thonestie of Diego, neither do I doubt any deceyte in his virtue, nor you
(daughter) for your part, ought to seame so curious to tooche them, seeing
that if they ymporte any poison, your beauty only is to be blamed, which was
the first bait that infected the knighte, and if he putt you in remembrance
of your rigor, I see no wrong he does you, considering the greatness of his
deserte, and the slender care you have of his due consideration, in which
mean time a page took up the letters, and gave them to tholde Lady, who

of my name, is no less hateful unto you, then the offer of any tormente what
tyranny so ever it ymporte, I find, the next acceptable service I can do you,
is (in mortefyinge whollye the cause of your displeasure, and with my
punishment to yield you contentemente) to putt such distance between us, that
neither you nor any other shall know the place of mine abode, and much less

for that I mean to accuse you to the hier of your deserte but that the world
(being privy to my case) may be thindifferent judge between my integrity,
and your cruelty, my loyal affection, and the wrong you do to ye reward of
my service, assuring my self notwithstanding, that the reaporte of my
death, will bring a remorse to your conscience, with a compassion (albeit to
late) seeing the same shall be thequal balance to paise my sincere and constante
intent, with your credulous and rash judgment, in admittinge for trothe, the
false suggestion of such as enuyed the virtue of our honest love, with a
suborned informacion of a frendshypp between me and the daughter of the Lord
of Sera? if you will make it (good madam) unlawful for a gentleman traded in
the disciplines of civility, to receive the presents of a Lady or
gentlewoman equal in degree or honor to him self: wherein will you to consiste

which as an enemy to thequitie of my cause, favors wholly the injustice of
your conceit, wherein seeing the spots of your mortal displeasure can not
be wiped away, but by the blodd of my life, which shows your content mente
to consiste wholly in my destruction, I account it a duty of reason, to
honor you with the sacrafise of my death, as well as I found cause to auowe
unto you the service of my life, which also I am yet to perform, so long as
my soul does keep her hold by the mortal thread and frail fillett of my
body, fyndinge this one thing to increase the miserye of my death, (passing

loyal servant. Dom Diego,

The tragical contents of this letter strick such soddaine dollor into the
mind of thold lady, that she seamed to participate with thaffliction of the pore
forrestian hermit, albeit dissimuling her passion affore her howshold
servants, retired into her chamber with her daughter only who^ she failed not
to rebuke in sharp sort for her folish cruelty, as the only cause of the loss
of so worthy a knight as Seigneur Diego, whose letter albeit she deciphered
unto her word by word, profer ringe with all, sundry ymportunities for
mediacion and grace on his behalf, yet seamed she as weak, to move the hard
heart of her daughter, as the myld Zephir, breathyng from ye western shore, is
hable to shake the monstrus rocks builded in the belly of the sea, and much
less the passion of herfury, iudginge his penance far inferior to ye desert of
his inco^stancy, wherewith the simple mother father complaining, then
correctynge the stubbornes of her daughter, dysmissed the messenger with only
charge to salute on her behalf his misters her dear friend and neighbor, who
altogether ignorant of the contents of the letter, reioysed notwithstanding
that her son had written to Geniuera, hopinge he had ymparted to her, the day
and hour of his return, wherein notwithstanding she was no less frustrate,
then her assurance proved uncertain, in such sort, yt the date of the twentye
day expired, eye ij. or three months fully performed without any news of her
son, she began to enter into no less terms of dollor then if she had
accompanied his corpse to his fatal tomb, exclayminge with all, against
thiniquitie of the heavens in blessing her with such a posterity, and then to
take him from her in the myddest of the prooffe of his virtue? wherein cryenge
out against the beauty of Geniuera, (which she judged the only cause of his
absence) cursed also the morning wherein he went on huntinge, wishinge in
the end that some reu^lacion would disclose unto her the place of his abode, to
the end, she might either reclaim him in whom consisted the hope of her old
age, and exspectacion of her whole house, or at least, assiste in person such
good or evil fortune as fell to his share.

If the mother complained her desaster, her son (as it is to be thought)
enjoyed small quiet and less contentmente of mind, who now become a citizen
with the beasts and birds of the forrestes, left neither root of tree,
height of rock, nor sonnye side of any green hill, without some sign or
mark of his careful state, wherein vsinge the point of a sharppe bodkyn, as
a supply of a steeled chezell, he would some time engraue the success of his
love upon a hard and dried tree, sometime a broad and thynne bark taken from
some young and grene spraie, served him in stead of paper or parchement,
wherein he cyphered with such dark letters the name of him self and his
mistres, drawn together within one intricate circle, that the best
mathematical in Padue or Paris, would demand respite to decipher the true
enterpretacion, one day amongst the rest, rauinge upon his thoughts by the
board or brinke of the fountain ioyninge (as you have hard) to his desert
cotage, he emprinted these verses followinge upon a fair stone, which the
stream of the river had cast upon the shore.

Oh sacred syluan Pan, and satirs of this vale,
And ye oh woddie nymphs, who weep in wretches plaint
Stay here your gliding stepps, record my doleful tale,
Judge you what I deserve, whom loyal love has spent,
Assiste my dried eyes, with fresh supply of tears:
Whose dropps of dule have draynd, each synowe of his sapp
Or else by fatal voice, cloase up my loathsome years
Whose view with longer life, increases my myshapp,
Not far from thence upon the heighte of a high hill, where he made every day
his morning walk at the risinge of the son, was a fair and square plat
yelding at all times of the year, a pleasante glee of grene flowers and other
deckinges of the spring, in the middell whereof, whether it were by the devise
of nature or curious industry of man, were four pillors supporting a massy
marble squared and hewn corner wise according to the form of an alter, upon
the which he left this monument in letters of eternity.

Thou pillor sqare, on whom er this, the sacred fumes did frye,
With incense to the blasing troane, and majesty on hye,
Deuest the now of royal robes, let regal office pass.
And dewed with my tears of dule, my sacryfice embrase,
Discloase thy marble breast, and harbor here such plaint
As neither former time has found, nor future age shall tainte,
And since disdain in love, has forced, this present want of breath,
Let hear appear ho we willingly, Diego proves death
Round about the brym of the said stone, he vvritte this remembrance,
Though froward fate, has forcde my grefe,
And black despair this deadly pain
Yet time I trust will bring relefe,
When loyal faith shall have her gain
Till then the storms of banished state
And penance in this harmittes cell
Shall try her cause of wrongful hate,
Whose malice lo, kepes me in hell,
And upon the thyn and tender bark of a beeche shadinge thentrye or door of
his hermitage, moved belyke with some soddayne apprehencion of joy above his
custom, writ this deuyse.
I See thy glory shine, with gle of glisteringe show
And thou for beatie s^alde, ou ^iest seat of state
At last so shall thou find, though now thou lift not know,
That time thy plumes will pluck and age thy hew abate,
Then vaunt not so in gain, that withers with the weed,
But de^ke the garland with such boddes, as virtue blomes
Else shalt thou reap with shame, but cockle for thy seed
When I most s^er shall have, my hier from heavenly doms.
Which being espied of his man, who as he always kept a diligente eye upon
him, so dowtinge these fantasies might work theffectes of greater extremities,
asked to what end served the lute which he brought in his mallet, if not to
give him solace sometime in singinge the praises of her, on whose behalf he
did not only offend in supersticius homage, but also in committing fond
ydolatrie will you that I fetch it (says he) to the end that with Orpheus,
you may stur up the trees, rocks and hollow valleys, to be wail your mishap,
and witness the penance which you make without ever committinge offense
worthy of half so great a punishmente, wherewith he put the lute into the
hand of his master, who albeit reaposed equal delight in the tunes of music,
and tears of present miserye, yet to confirm his solytarie state with a
remembrance of his ancient passions, he played certain dollorus notes, not
without a number of hollow sighs and streams of sorrow distillinge like the
drops of rain down his face, which was so dis^igured, that hardly cold he
have been descried by such as have always been his most famyliars.

This was the miserable state of this unfortunate young man, who was so
whollye resolved to present despair, that he durst not admit the offer of
better hope, and much less ymagyn that, which now attendes to restore him
every way to his entyer, albeit like as neither the miseries or felicities of
men be of perpetuytie, and every thing has his proper time, so fortune,
disposed to compassion, and wearye at last of the sondrye wrongs she had don
to the penitencier of Geniuera, lent him a mean to ^lymbe the higheste staff
of her wheel, wherein certainly appeared a special effect of the providence
of God, who only does and is hable to prefer a facility in things that seame
most hard and ympossible in the judgment of man, like as also the means
whereby he works and makes the ministers of his will, are so secret, and far
from the knowledge of us wretches, that when we think utterly to loase any
thing, yet then our exspectacion is deceived in reteyning that which ear^^ we
yielded for lost, in such sort, that as what favor soever fortune does give
us, we are not hable to assure our own estates, So likewise ought we not to
despair or desye our selves for any aduersatie, how great soever it appear,
seeing that god, exposing daily effects of mercy upon us, wills us to reapose
our hope and assurance in his goodness, which as he has declared by manifold
examples in the person of our dear friends, so our own eyes have been
witnesses of the wonderful merueiles he has wrought in like cases, for how
many have we seen, in our time, who being in the power of their enemies,
judged to dye, yea brought to ye place where the last and fatal blow of
execution should be given, were not only taken, by great marvel, out of the
hands of such perils, but (for a more wonder and admiracion of the mysteries
of god) called to the state of a kingdom, which royal authority over a whole
people which because it is necessary to instefye by some authority and ancient
proof, I have thought good to ympart unto you, in this digressio^ yt which I
have no ted out of ye records of Plyny, an example albeit not famylyar, yet of
undoubted truth: for at such time as Ladislas son of king Anbart, reigned in
Hongarye and Boemya, being of tender years and semblable experience for the
direction of his state, was constrained to reapose all his creditte in
thopynions of his barons and lords of advise, amongst whom, by occasion of
civil sedicion, grew a peculiar grudge between the children of the Lord John
Vnyades vvayuode, deceased not long affore, and in his life the only protector
af the king and tutor of the multitude, and Henry earl of Celye next consing
and parent to the king that then lived.

This quarrel grew to such terms of revenge, that therle of Celye being one
day in a church in one of the chief Cities of Hungary, was mordered by the
hands of the said Vnyade, which being brought ymediatly to the ears of the
king, he was advised to dyssymule his just wrath, for that at such hour he
was not of sufficient power to give correction to o great a presumption,
albeit retiringe ymediatlye to Budo, thordynarye place of his abode, and where
his greatest force remeyned, he seized upon both the children of VVayuode, and
stryke of the head of the theldeste called Ladislas, deferring justice to the
other named Mathias, for the respect of his young years, albeit he enclosed
him in sewer prison, within the kingdom of Boemia, where, as he remained
without hope of long life, or end of his imprisonment, but by death: So it
chanced not long after, that the king Ladislas coming to do execution of
thinfa^te of wyuado, dyed in the same town, where he endured his miserable
captivity, whereupon the Boemians chosed for their king one George
Pogibracehio, the Hungariens on the other side, advertised of the death of
their sovereign, began to enter into compassion toward the prisoner, and
preferringe to memory the virtue of his father, at such time as he bare
authority in their public weal, they proclaimed Mathias king of Hongarie,
who being in the custody and danger of George newly adopted king of Boemya,
was not only delivered by him, but also, he gave him his daughter in mariag, by
which means, of a pore desperate prisoner, he becam in one instant a puissant
King, whereunto as he durst never before aspire by any hope or likelihod yt
appeared, so if it had not ben for his adversity, he had never sit in ye seat
royal of Hungary, both for that they would have chosen an other, his elder
brother Ladislas hadd been before him, the county which they slew would have
resisted such preferment, but chieflye it is like the Hungariens would not hau
given him such large title of dignitye, if it had not ben for the respect of
compassion they used upon his miserable captivity, who as he came to ye
crown (as you see) by ye same mean which ye other lost it, so the famous
Historiographer Titus Liuius, makes mention of the like accidente happening to
Iacques de Lusi^ano uncle to Petre, king of Cipres, at ye solemn feast of
whose coronatio^, the Ieneuoys and Venetiens co^tended for superiority, either
of them striving for the prefermente of the first place in that assembly, in
the presence of whom, Iacques de Lusiuano partial on the Venetiens side,
caused certain of the Ieneuoyes to be executed, whereof the state of Ieyne,
being advertised, determined to take cruel venga^ce, where unto they added such
expedicion, that in a monie^t they had levied a great army under the
conduction of Pierro Fregose a Venice taken and putt to sack by Pirro Fregos.

so good fortune, that the took ye isle and put the city to sack, reseruyng
notwithstanding, the life of Jacques Lusyuano, whom he carried prisoner to Ieane,
where the senate enjoined him to perpertual ymprisonment wtin the strongest
tower of their city, wherein albeit he continued (without hope of liberty, or
exspectacion to enjoy any part of his ancient dignity) by the space of nine
yers, yet yt happened in ye end of the said term, that fortune torning her
wheel, gave sa^ feconduit to the king Pierro to pass into the other world, with
out heir of his body, by reason whereof thinhabita^tes of the isle considering
Seigneur Lusyuano was of the blodd royal, and next parent to their dead lord,
took such compassion of his captivity with a remorce of his long penance,
that inconsideration of his misery, procedynge by their occasion, they redeemed
his liberty with a great exaction of money, and anointed him king of Cypres,
which peradventure he hadd never possessed, if the desolacion of his
ymprisonement had not wroughte the mean, (albeit he had enjoyed his liberty
and pursewed it to thuttermost) such is the wonderful providence of God,
punishynge the wicked at his pleasure, and (restoring the misery of such as
despair of worldly succor) exposes effects of his omnipotency exceeding
thexspectacion and ymagynacion of the creatures of the earth: such was also
the case of Dom Diego, who determined wholly to spend the remeynder of his
life in the study of solytarie philosophy upon the wild and rich mountes
Pireney, was reliued and restored when he was least in opinion or hope of
succor.

For as you have hard he had a neighbor and dear friend called Dom Roderico
who above the rest, lamented chiefly tha^sence and misfortune of Diego. It
chanced within twenty and two months after the pilgrim began his voyage,
that this Roderico (having been in Gascoyne to dispatche certain necessary
affairs there) in his return to Barcelonia, whether he had missed the path of
his right way, or that the sprite of god (as it was most like) guided him,
was or he wyste upon the caryre that ledd him directly to that place of the
mou^tes, where was thordinary residence of his great friend Diego, who grew so
fast into declynation and debilitie of his body, that if ye clemency of the
highest had not over shadowed him, he had wroughte the wretched effect of that
which he chiefly desired, that is with the loss of life, to give end to his
hard penance.

Dom Roderico wandering thus in the wilderness of ye mountes, dispercing his
train to discover some places of habitacion, was advertised by one of his
people, being within tweluescore yardes of the hermits cave, of a tracke and
steps of men, not without some merueile notwithstanding, for that
thinfertillety of ye place showed no abode nor repair for civil people,
whereupon as they debated and were in devise to appoint one of the company to
follow the trace somewhat further, they saw one enter the mouth of the cave,
which was Dom Diego, who came from the top of the hill affore mentioned, where
he had newly performed his morninge complaint, with his face directly toward
the cost, where he judged was thoracle of the saint to who^ he dressed his
deuocions, ye knight sent one of his valletts to approach the cave, and know
what they were, yt lived so solitarily, and withal to demand the high way
to Barcelonia, but he discovering (a far the scituacion of the hoale so well
fortefied and rampierd with stones and blocks cowched in the form of a
trenche, fearing the same to be the receptacle or forte of some that kept house
by the high way side living of large revenue, durst neither come Thieves.
nere it nor ask the way as he was commanded by his master to whom as he
returned with more fear of his shadow, then true reaporte of that he had in
charge, so the valiant knight, of more courage then his cowardly servant, put
spurs to his horse, gallopyng to the veraye door of the cave, where he
ceased not to call and knock, till he saw comme owte a man, so disfigured
with leannes of his face, and other exterior deformotie of his body, that his
veraye regard moved compassion to Roderico, who asking what he was, demanded
also the common way to Barcelonia, this was the servant of Diego, who
answered that he could yield him no reason of ye way to Barcelonya, and less
instruct him touching the costs of the country, for that (says he) (not
without some sighs and other doleful regardes) we are two pore brethern, whom
the adventure of fortune has brought hither to do penance, and mortify our
present age for the sins and offenses of our youth passed, which words of
two pore brethren brought thither as strangers, by the guide of fortune, with
the present remembrance of Diego and his seruante, argued such suspicion to
Roderico that he alighted, not for that he thought to encounter him whom he
most desired to embrase, but to see only the singularities of the rock, and
the mystery of the closse castle, builded in the bellye of the earth, where
finding him whom he serched (without knowing notwithsta^dynge what he was)
entered into conference together of the difference between the felicity of the
solitary lif, and miseries which they find that participate with the wretched
follies of this world, for (says he) the mind withdrawn from ye view of
worldly vanities, takes his only pleasure in the contemplacio^ of heavenly
things, being always more apt to observe the commandments of God, with a
sincere reverence to their maker, then those which haunte the common
conversation of men Wherein truly (when all is said) continual frequent^cio^
one with an other, delites, ambicious, covetousness, and superfluities of all
vices, which we find in this confused amass^ and corrupt world, do cause us
to mistake our selves, forget our duty toward our creator, fall into a
perilous disdain of pity and charity, and some time to diuerte the
sincerity of the true religion, and abuse thintegritie and undoubted
interpretation of the gospel, which I leave to be debated at large by ye
theologia^s to who^ such charge does chiefly apperteine. As ye unknown hermit
and the knight Roderico were in devises, certain of his servants visitinge
every cell and celler of the cave, found in the top of a vawlte framed of
certain sparres of wood, rammed in ye earthie wall at both ends, two saddells,
the one whereof (seamynge to have served heretofore some fair Ienett), was
covered with crimsyn veluett, fringed round about with silver throme, stodded
with nails of sondrie enameyle, and armed with plates of steile, wrought
curiouslye upon, with certain rays and streams of pure gold, which (albeit
the rouste had defaced the steel) lost nothing of his entyer and beautye,
and as one of the company offered to buy them, seeing neither horse nor moyle
worthy to wear such furniture, ye knight, having ended his discourse with ye
master hermitt, sou^ded to horse with intent to leave the poor men in peace,
and search some other mean to find out the high way, whereupon he that was
desyerous to buy the saddels, presented them to his master, who as he beheld
them, felt a second motion or remembrance of his friend Diego, wherewith
searchinge the harneys and every pendell of the sadle, he found this
inscription written in spanishe upon the crooper Quebratare la fe, es cosa muy
fea, which is in english, to break thy faith is a detestable thing.

This devise restored cause of new astonishmente, for that it agreed with
thordynary stampp which Dom Diego bare always in his armor, which the rather
confirmed him in opinion, that without doubt the sadle apperteined to the one
of the two pilgrims, whom as he began to behold with a more percinge regard
then before, without discerninge in either of them any sign or mark of
knowledge, by reason of their hideus and disfigured hew: So Dom Diego saying
the diligence of his friend, with desire he hadd to discover him, began to
labor of a passion of trembling fear, with such Ielewse doubt of him self,
that the blodd (moved in thinner parts, and ascended (maugre his resistance)
into the face and other places of discovery, bewrayed thinward alteration of
his mind, which with the uncertain regard of his eyes, showed to Roderico an
absolute assurance of that which erst he durst not suspecte, and that which
gave also credit to his conceit, was a lock of his curled hear, which he
kept wrapte about his right ear, whereupon he dismissed all suspicion, and
as one assured of his doubt, threw his arms about the neck of his friend,
wateryng his breast with the tears of his eyes and said unto him, Alas
Seigneur Diego, Roderico dis covers and embraseth his friend Dom Diego.
what disfauor of the heavens have kept you so long from the company of
those that dye of distress in the absence of you, whose presence was the
pillar of their consolation? What be they that have procured this long eclipps
of your name, when it ought to expose the clearest light, both for the glory
of your present youth, and honor of your future old age? Ah is it my company
that moves this long scilence in you, is it I that have deserved this wrong at
your hands, to abuse the virtue of my honest frendshipp with a shameful
fear to disclose your self unto me, and doom regardes without argument of
gladness? Do you think alas, that I know not him whom I embrace? no no, I can
not be so simple nor my judgment blinded any longer in the knowledge of him,
whom the secret instinct of my heart discovered at my first entrey into this
cave, neither is there any part in me of iudment, that doubts you to be the
same Seigneur Diego, whose renown resowndes thuttermost confynes of spain,
and God forbid, that I depart here hens, without carieng with me the glory of
equal contentement to ii. indifferently passioned in your absence, the one to
my self, ioyinge in my happy fortune, to draw you out of the dongeo^ of this
calamitye, the other in making so gladsome a present to your mother,
impartinge also the joyful news to your subjects and servants, whose eyes
are not yet dry with the tears of your departure.

Here Dom Diego seeing he could no longer dissemble that which was so plainly
disclosed, and construing to the best the thankeful co^gratulacio^s of his
friend, began to relente in his heart, no less then the gladsom mother in
recoueringe her child that has been long kept from her, or the chaste wi^,
(lo^g^ destitute of the presence of her dear husband) reioyseth when she
holds him in her arms and may embrase him at pleasure, wherein being also
indifferently passioned between delight and dollor, honest shame and semblable
fear, passinge a declaration of his inward trouble of mind by the co^duites
of his eyes, distilling streams of sorrow and joy by great abundance,
returned thimbrassements of his friend, with no less hearty affection, then
the other with good will, somoned this new acquaintance, sainge, Ah how secret
is the determination of God and his judgments inscrutable, I resolved here to
attend the end of my miserable days, without making my Diego acknowledges
himself to Roderico.
intent privy to any man in the world, and lo now am I del^ried, when I
feared least my discovery, I am truly says he, with a pitiful discharge
of a number of dollorous sighs, the same infortunat Diego and your dear
friend, who (persecuted with continual affliction and tormente of fortune),
was so weary of the world, that I chosed this deserte habitation, as a secrett
receptacle, to perform the rest of the voyage which nature has enjoined me
in this trans^torie and wretched vale, where saying you have unhappily
discovered me, I beseech you (by the honor of your name, and virtue of that
friendship continued between us from the beginning), let it suffice you that you
have seen me, without procuring impedimente to the rest of my willing
penance, by imparting the place of my retreat to any.

Whereunto Roderico did not only refuse to co^disce^de, but also continuing his
former earnest, persuaded him to disco^tinue that brutal lif, with admonition
yt God had made them noble, and given them authority, not with charge, to
live idle either in their pallaceis or other obscure place, but so to bestow
their tallente, yt with the example of their virtue, thignorant may be
instructed in ye trade of honest living, the good men Thoffice of a noble man
or one in authority.
supported in their integrity, and the bad sort kept in awe by their justice.

And for your part (says he) how vainly may your subjects and people
rejoice, in that God has blessed them with a Lord to their contentacion, if
affore thexperience of our virtue, they loase the cause of their contentement:
what comfort or quiett think you, can harbor within the careful breast of
your desolate mother, who has made the world happy with so honest a son,
bringinge you up with such diligence, that you lack nothing to make you
parfect, and in this sort to loase the fruit and exspectacio^ of such
norriture? it is you (sir) who^ duty commands to yield obedience to your
parents, soccour to thafflicted, and do justice to such as demand right at
your hand? alas it is your pore subjects who, lamenting your absence,
complains of the wrong you do to them in de^nieng the use of your presence?
it is you that ouerwhelmes tholde years of your mother with untimely
desolation? it is you that renews the course of her continual complaints in
breakyng your faith towching the day of your reatorne.

Wherewith thinpatience of Dom Diego in hearing thobiections of his own
faltes, brake his further discourse, excusing him self in this sort.

Yt is easy (says he) for him that is well to compforte the sick, and hard
for such as be in distres, to admit any council Diego excuses his departure
from his country.
in their evil: you find a facility to give judgment of my disease, being
whollye ignorante of the cause, and accuse my absence rather by desire to do me
good, the^ of any malice you owe to my wretched state, but if you understood
the circunstance of my misfortune, and the occasion that first moved me to make
trial of this solitary life, you would convert (I doubt not) this sinister
conceit of the wrong which you charge me to do to all men, to an oppinion of
right on my behalf, seeing the most wise, and assured of al, assailed with the
like tormente of sprite, which I feel quarrelling with the constancye of my
mind, have left example of faltes of no less fragilitie, then mine, I
confess is justly meritorious of reprehencion, wherewith drawing Rodorico
aparte from the rest, he preferred a particular discourse of his love, his
possibility and good hope in ye beginning, his sinister success in thend,
with the continu acion of the unjust crueltye of his mistres, whose name he
cold not pronounce without such fluddes of tears and skorchynge sighs, that
for the time they stayed the course of his words, mouinge such compassion to
the tender heart of Roderico, that he was forced to keep him company with
semblable kindness, assaing notwithstanding to remove the veil of such desperate
opinion, with request to discontinue his savage life in the desolate forrestes,
wherein he prevailed as much as if he had undertaken to persuade a multitude
without a tongue, for that the resolved hermit told him, that he would not only
be tenant to the mountes so long as nature and he cold agree upon the bargain
of life, but also aduowed unto him by oath, that (without the good will of his
Geniuera) he would never return to his country, and (to avoid further
discovery) would seek to shroud him self in a place more savage, and less
frequented the^ this, for says he) like as my return would bring but increase
of passion, specially in being denied favor where I have found a former repulse
I beseech you, let it suffice yt I feel ye burden of one mishap, ceassing to
allure me to ye prooff of a second affliction wourse I am sewer, then my
present punishemente, whereunto I have added a contentement with an immouable
patience: wherein his raisons seamed to include such indifferent justice and
pity, that Roderico cold not reply but with terms of compassion, with
consent that he should continue his abode there yet ij. months, in which
time he swear unto him (by the honor of knightehodd), that for his part, he
would not only make his peace with his cruel mistres, but also procure mutual
conference between them, assuring him withal, that he should not be
discovered by him nor any of his train, wherewith, leaving him a feelde bed
and ij men with money too furnyshe his want, he took his leave, with firm
promise to see him again in short time, with cause of more contentemente,
then at that present he left him full of annoye and himself no less
disquieted for the trouble of his friend, wherein God knows in what sort he
detested (by the ways) the wilful cruelty of Geniuera, blasphemyng no less
against the whole sect (paraduenture) with some raison. For there is (I can
not tell) what secret motions in the minds of women which have their hours and
times as thincreasynge or dyminishynge of the moon, whereof as it is very
hard (without great experience) to give any raison touching the cause, So we
see it is such a principle or generality amongst theime to ymprinte so sewerly
in their hearts this frail or rather inconstante instinctes of mobilitie, that
the wiseste and most subtle that ever was, lack skill to observe the seasons
of this ymperfecte humor.

Dom Roderico by this was arrived at his house, where he neither forgatt his
own promise, nor the necessity of his friend, for the next day he went to
the lodging of Geniuera, not to communicate with her asyett, and much less
to impart his fortunat encounter in his return out of Gascoyn, but rather to
sound by some secrett circumstance a far of, the doings and determination of
the girl, and whether any other usurped the glory of the victory, which of
right belonged to his friend Diego, wherein he was so subtle in this drifte,
that he accoasted the page of the gentlewoman, in whose bosom was builded the
only store house of her most secret affairs, forgettinge therein the precepte
of the wise, who wills us to commit no council to such as are weak of
raison, and for wa^te of discretion, do lack the gift of secretenes, The
wise man vvil never comytt councelle to children
whereby they are not hable to govern the liberty of their tounges, such was
the simplicity of this page, whose soft humor, the knighte fed with such fine
dyot, that by little and little, he drew the worm quite from his nose, and was
made so privy to the practis of Geniuera, that he understood, that since her
unjust displeasure with Dom Diego, she hadd vowed her good will to a biskaine,
as then ye steward of her mothers house, a gentleman very pore, but for the
rest of sufficient perfection, and that he was now in ye country, from whence
he gave aduertisme^t to his mistres, yt within two days he would come with ij.
other his dear friends, to take Geniuera, away by stealth, not forgetting also
yt he only (with a ge^tlwoman) were appointed to attend her into Byskaye, like as
they were privy to every circunstance of their secret slight, which discourse
of ye boy, albeit moved show of inward alteration in Roderico, chiefly for the
infidelity and treyson of thinconstant Geniuera, yet he dyssimuled so well his
fretting anger, yt his passion was not discovered by the simple page, with whom
he joined in co^mendacion towching the resolucion of his mistres, whom he said
was not void of reason to make her choice by the council and consent of her
fancy, seeing her mother used such slender diligence to bestow her as she
deserved, and albeit (says he) the gentleman be not rich nor of large
possessions, yet thy mistres has sufficient means to supplye both their
wantes that way, only she declares a virtue in yeldyng so firm affection to
his honest poverty, all which as he pronounced by an other tongue, then the
true interpretor of his heart, so being alone, cryeng out of thinconsta^cie of
women, he seamed to put no difference between their wilful blindness, and
natural simplicity of young infantes, Women compared to infates.

fond love yt blaires their eyes, or the dome of a cursed desteny, which god
has appointed to plage their malicius disposicio^, seame often times so void
of raiso^, yt being presented with the choice of two offers far differing in
value, they are rather apt to imbrase ye worst, then ready to admit ye best,
which is most convenient for their honor and calling: he defaced ye beauty of
Geniuera with the destoyaltye she used toward her first seruante,
condemnynge her judgment in refusing the friendship of a noble man, famous by
wealth and virtue, and the very parragon of the wholle country, for the
society of a pore companion, whose parents being unknown, argued a doubt of
his discente, and she altogether astraunger to bys dispocition, wherein as he
inueighed also indifferently against ye partiallitie of fortune and blindness of
love, who being without eyes them selves, do likewise dym the understanding
of such as they keep in miserable captivity. So he swear in great rage, to
cast such a block in the way of the two lovers, that neither the biskayn
should reap the fruits due to the travail and service of his friend Diego,
nor his cruel mistres forbear any longer to send a pleasante calm to the
stormye tempest which kepes him now at anchor amongst the perilous rocks of
Pireneus.

For being informed of this convenient mean to ease the distress of his
languishinge friend, who fedd only of the hope of his promise, he failed not to
add an assured effect according lie, Albeit for his further instruction
touching the sewer con ueigh of the mystery, he went the second day after,
to visit the mother of Geniuera, where he understood by the page, that the
steward was come with two other valyante gentlemen to assiste his enterprise,
and that the next night upon the first hour after midnighte, when the old
Lady and all her servants, overwhelmed with the charm or mantel of dead
sleep, were least apt to suspect conspiracies, they determined to depart the
castle with his mistres, who for her part had furnished her wantes of all
necessaryes touching the voyage.

This hasty resolucion required a spedie diligence in the knight, who for his
part also used no less expedicion then was convenient, for being come to his
house he caused to arm ten or xy. gentlemen of his neighbors and vassalls, to
whom he communicated the some of his intent, and the same night, some two or
three hours affore the departure of the Biskayne and his company, marched in
secret manner directly in the way, where they should pass, til they came to a
grove or coppyes of young wood, regardinge the high way on the one side, and
a main common or plain on the other side, where bestowinge himself and his
company in am bushe, he hard yinediatly the noise of horses and men
approaching with an unfortunate diligence: the light of the moon discovered
the gentlewoman, whose beauty seamed to contend with the brightness of the
same, next unto who^ ridd her miserable lover, whom as soon as Roderico
parceiued within the danger of his carear, he felt a conversion of his
aunciente anger into a compassion of present furye, whose force sommonynge him
to an effect of morder, caused him to cowche his spear in his reaste,

unhappily under the conduction of a blind and naked boy, aduising the rest
of the biskaines to eschew the like reward oneless they attended a semblable
hier to him that had wrong fully encroched upon the ground of another: they
seamed more willinge to accept his offer, then ready to revenge the death of
their captain, Whom (saying the discovery o^ the whole ambushe) they left
on the ground taking his leave of his mistres with the last breath of his
life, and reaposed their chiefeste confidence in the swiftnes of their horses,
without regard who pursewed their hasty flight, ymediatlye two of the company
of Dom Roderico disguised in unknown armor, seized upon the sorrowful
Geniuera, who cold not use such patience in the death of her biskaine lover,
but her open cries complayninge of the villenye of the morder, witnessed her
inward sorrow of mind, wherein according to the shortness of her breath,
(laboring then in passion of extreme dollor) she exclaymed without respect
against them, crying to perform an execution of their cruelty upon her,
as well as they had discharged the office of unjust tormentors of one, who was
of more price then they all, and so torninge her to the dead body of her late
friend, washed a way the blod of his wounds with the tears of her eyes, not
without great exclamacion against the malice of her destenies, in abridginge
her exspectacion of long joy, with so short and tragical an end, forcing
her to resign the socitie of him, whom she loved no less then her self, to
commit the honor of her virginity to a pray to the^es and villeynes, wherewith
Roderico, without disclosinge his face, or other part of knowledge, took her
by the hand, with perswacion to dismiss these dollors, saying that her
complaints had no virtue to restore life to him that was dead, and much
less to take vengance of the fact. But she renewinge the remembrance of him
that lay dead of the ground, by certain streams of his blodd, which she
espied upon the gawntlet of Roderico, began to loase more patience then affore,
in such sort, that the rudest of the company, having for an increase of his
terrible regard a visarne or false beard of black hear curled like the
Mauretyne, with a pair of counterfaite eyes of glass, approached (by
appointment) the trembing Geniuera, to whose fear he added an increase of
terror in offringe the point of his naked dagger to her white and delicate
neck, threatninge, that if she continued in these terms, his hands should
perform the sacrafize of her life, to the shadow of the villayne whom she
lamented so much, and who (says he) deserved rather to be broken in pieces of
the whele, by the execucioners of torments, then end his life by the hands
of a valyant knight, which mortal threats (as she thought) forcing her to an
unwilling scilence, left her only thassista^ce of her eyes, to yield compassion
to her greffe, who set a broch so larglye the conduites of their watery humors,
that the passion of her heart appeared in thabundance of her tears and broken
sighs, whose force prevailed so much over her tender resistance, that in
the end her outward dule seamed enclosed and couched by force, in the ynner
corners of her heavy heart, in the mean while the rest of the company, had
carried the body of the dead biskayne to a felden chapel, builded upon the
high way side, where he sleapes in hisfatal bed covered with a testor of green
soddes.

A notable example sewer, proving the ordynarie success of secret contractes
and marriages made by stelth, where both the honor of the contractors loses
his virtue, and the commandment of God broken, enioyninge us by special
words to a dutiful humylitie and sincere obedience to our pare^ tes, to whom
the Law gives authority to punish us by de privation and loss of
thinheritance which natural rights would give us, if we did not rebel and
abuse the liberty which we enjoy by their goodness, wherein thidiscret mothexs
now a days, deserve most ymputacion of blame, who in giving place to the
wilful inclynacio^ of their fond youth, do account it no offense to suffer
their daughters to comunicate matters of love with their howshode servants not
reme^bringe thinfirmitie of such tender vessels, how proa^e me^ are by nanature
to do evil, and lastly how ready ye evil spirit is to enter fynding us
unprovided, to thend ye falling into his danger, he may triumph in ye ruin of
our souls, purified through the blod of our savior, which as I need not go
(...) to prove with new authorities, co^sidring I have noted sufficient touching
both respects in diverse places of this tra^slacio^, so wishi^g well to al
children, and ame^dme^t to such fond mothers as seame more careful to flatter
ye vain appetit of their frail ymps, the^ curious to give them ye rod of
correction, which kepes them always wtin ye view of virtue, it is time to
resort to Dom Roderico, and his train, who traveling iij. or four days with
his captive Geniuera, (not knowing any of the company) arrived at last within
half a days journey of the hermitage of Diego, who^ he gave warning of his
coming by a foreryder of his co^ pany who also for his part, as he had
received such co^pfort, in exspectacio^ of theffect of ye promise of his
fre^d, yt in ye time of his absence he seamed to recover ye best part of his
ancient bewty, so ye news of thaproch of his mistres, breathed in him such
doble passion of Jeleose joy, and doutfull fear that seaming uncertain wherein
to resolve himself, durst skarcely admit a possibility in that whereof ye
message ymported absolute assurance, yelding notwithstanding special thanks
to the director of the stars, for this last favor showed upon his distress,
in preferrynge him to the sight of her, who being thee cause of his tormente,
may also put her last hand to his fatal execution, for with what greater
joy or contentemente (says he) can can I visit the dark shadoes and
ghostes disburdned of this life, then to yield up breath in the presence of
her, whom if I have honored in my life, it is nothing in respect of the service
my soul has vowed on her behalf in the other world in goinge affore to
perform the office of her harbinger among the Angels in paradise: in the
mean while Dom Roderico, who hitherto had not discovered himself to Geniuera,
was disarmed, and with open face accosteth her as she rydes debating with her
in this sort.

I dowt not at all, but you find it very strange, to see me in this place in
such attire, and upon an occasion, so contrary to the rank and honor I
profess, and the rather by thexperience Roderico to geniuera.
of the present Injury you think you have received by me, who hitherto have
borne the face of an affectioned friend to all your house, and me think I see
how you dispose your self to accuse thiniustice of my cause, in forcinge you
to exchange the company of your dear friend, to commit you to the society
of these deserte confines, wherein also as I have nothing to defend me from
ymputacio^ of just blame on your behalf, but the virtue of that true friendship
which knittes together with an indissoluble unity the hearts of men, so for
your part, if you will rightly measure my honest meaning in this enterprise,
and removing the veil of pertiall disdain, digest the angry beginning with
ymagynacion of a pleasante end, I dare abide the sentence of your in different
judgment, whether I be wholly worthy of reprehencion, or you altogether void
of falte.

I beseech you also consider that the true and loyal seruante, indeuoringe
himself to perform to thuttermoste, the will of him that has power to
command him, does not only deserve a chief place of favor with his Lord,
but also a consideracion according to the merit of his service, which I do not
infer to solicit my thanks with you, whom I have rather offended then
contented, in exposing on effect of honest zeal I owe to all verteus and
chaste Ladies, whereof for your part you shall find me no nigardee on your
bebehalf in time and place of need, desiering you (in dismissing al sinister
conceits of unworthy grudge) to prefer no less modesty then ought to
accompany a gentlewoma^ of your age and calling, seeing that honor seameth
best contented with the place and subject where he remeineth, using courtesy,
then in abusing their greatness, to prefer malicious crueltye, and because we
approach near the place, where I intend (God willing) to present you,
cutting of now your suspe^ce with an exposicion of my meaning, you must note,
that, that which is already paste, with the residue yet to be performed,
tends to no other end, then to releue the distress of ye most loyal lover
that this day has his being vnter the circle of the mo^e: Yt is the noble and
valyante knighte Dom Diego, the most constante seruan te that ever bare name
to be worthy to do service to any Lady, who for the respect of your
displeasure, has registered himself amydd the hideus rocks of these savage
and solitary valleys, it is to him I lead you, (protestinge to you by the
heavens) that the misery wherein I saw him plunged on all sides, not six
wekes passed, touched me so near, that if the sacrifize of my life only
would have discharged the price or raunsom of his martirdom, you had been free
from this passion of perplexity by my means, and I not partaker of these
angry regardes, which threaten the utter loss of your good will, wherein as it
is only I that have committed the offense (if there be any falte at all) so I
beseech you let me only endure the punishment, with request, that you extend
compassion upon the desolation of him, who almost wasted with pyninge misery,
reaposeth (for your sake) a felicity in thextremitie of his hard penance. If
Geniuera were half desperate before, for the death of her Biskaine lover, it is
now she is ready to excede the lymittes of raison, frettinge with such inward
spite against the simple record of the name of Diego, yt her malicious rage,
forcing a scile^^ce for the time, drive her to a respit in forminge her
answer, albeit as the passion of impatience is neither so perilous, nor of
such continuance as other traunces accidental or proper, so vnclosing her eyes,
she fixed them upon Roderico with no less furious regard, then the tigress
beholding ye devouring of her whelps before her face, and wringing her hands,
with her long and small arms a cross upon her tender breast, she exclaymed
against his discourtesie in this sort.

Ah mordring traitor (says she) no more worthy of the honor of knightehodd,
for that thou have forfeited thy faith by a Geniuera exclameth against Roderico.
detestable traison, is it upon me thou ought to wreake such an effect of
thy malicious villanye, or have thou dissembled thy grudge so long with a
show of fliering favor (like the cockadrell) toward all our house, to vomitt
thy venim upon me who never deserved but well at thy hands? Haste thou the face
to entreat me for an other, saying in my presence thou have killed him whose
blood I will purse we upon the and thine so long as I have one gasp of breath
to accuse thy villainy? what authority have thou to inquire of my doings or
impesh my determination, or in what sort am I bound to yield ye acco^pte of
any resolution of mine? who has made the arbitrator, or much less given the
commission to debate upon tharticles of my marriage? unless thy malice will
force me to love that desloyall villain, for whom thou haste committed an act
of perpetual infamy to thy name, whereof also for my part, I will reserve such
remembrance in the storehouse of my heart, that only death shall take away ye
desire to revenge the wrong thou have done me, and albeit fortune has made me
thy prisoner, with power to dispose of me at thy pleasure, yet have I one
resistance to defeat the extremity of thy force, which also I will not fail
to put in execution, yt is, that before thy traitorous clia^te Diego quench his
thirst with the precious Iewste of my virginity, these hands are ready to
give me a fatal pasport to visit (with bloody ghost) the loyalty of him,
who^ thou have slain by traitorous co^spiracie? therefore if I may honestly
request the whom I hate, or if there be exspectacio^ of favor in a mortal
enemy, I beseech yt, either perform the last fac^e of thy cruelty upon me,
or according to thy duty, dismiss me with my woman and page, to go whether
our fortune will guide us. God forbid says Roderico, that in doing wrong to
the hope of my friend, I beco^me thoccasio^ of his untimely death, and loss of
you, wa^dring by the unknown paths of this wild deserts, and continuing
still his former earnest, to move her to some pity, upon ye poor penitencier,
he seamed to gain as much as if he had assailed to number the sand lying upon
the brinke of the endless occean, albeit with ye supply of several discourses,
they arrived at last at the rich hospital of Dom Diego, who for want of
curious co^ceites to welcome his cruel mistres, presented his loathsome
parsonage ouergrowen with hair, and for a more show of humility fell
prostrate before her, embracings her feet, not without great effusion of
tears, saying*

Alas good madam: the only hope of my life and co^pforte of my Diego upon his
knees (...) ueth pytye.
careful heart, how long shall I hang in the doubteful balance of my
present death, or life? what date alas have you appointed to give end to my
desperate sorrows, if my penance not sufficient for thoffence I have
committed? Yea What tormente have you in store, which I am not ready to
endure to yield you contentement? neither hadd I hadd breath at this present to
put you in rem em brance of my distress, if I had not with holden my hands
from fatal violatio^, to witness my loayltie on your behalf, and much less,
been in case to prefer mine innocence, if the only food of secrett
contemplation of your beautye, hadd not distilled continual ^orriture to the
vital parts of my consumed corpse: And as you may easelye ymagine what
pleasure I found in this long and paineful absence, so I grieve not in any
thing that is past, nor refuce to abide any future punishment, if only I may
receive at your hands the reward of my constancy, which I may boldlye
compare with the most assured that ever was.

Geniuera swellynge with disdain and full of femenine rage, appearing in her
sparklyng eyes, and other parts of her face, did not only refuce to answer,
but also forbarre to behold him whom she hated, she barred him also ye benefit
of her face, in bestowing her looks to the contrary side, which moved cause of
doble sorrow to the pour afflicted lover, who being yet upon his knees,
renewinge the sorce of his tears with the view of the tyranny of his
mistres, seamed to draw with much ado, a feeble voice, from the very bottom
of his stomach, and restored the terms of his former complainte in this
sort, seeing neither the sincerity of my faith, approved with so long and
loyal service, nor the Dom Diego being still prostrate cries for compassion to
his mistrys
view of my present misery, whereof I have made a painful experience without
intermission thies xxij. months, be of force to persuade a creditt in my
constancy, seeing also my doleful tears derived of the injustice of your
disdain, are denied to work effects of tuste pity in you, and lastelye,
seeing without the consent of your goodwill, I find an ympossibilitie to live,
I beseech you, (...) by the virtue and courtesy which ought to app^^^ (...)
I conjure you, as the last request wherewith (...) tu^at servant will troble
you in this world, to mor^^^ (...) ^ur own hands the remembrance of that
offen^^ (...) you ymagyn I have done against you, with there (...) present
death refuce not (oh cruel mistres) to do vengaunce upon him who is wearye
of his life, and receive at last this willinge offer, ymportyng two singler
commodities, the one a pleasure to me to buy thy conte^tement with ye price of
my blod, the other an absolute quiet to thy self in being satiffied wc his
death whose lif thou abhorrest, wherein certainly for my part I am to account yt
hour most happy, which closyng up my mortal eyes, does sound also the
fatal retraict of my long sorrows, but the chiefest felicity I account in
this last act of my life is, that in being so willing to dye by the stroke of
thy hand, I shall leave the to ymagin how ready I was to honor the with the
unfeigned service of my life, the world to give judgment of my loyalty, and the
gods to take vengaunce of thy cruelitie: if there be reason in my request, why
defarre you thexecutio^, or if I have failled in my demand, why stay you to
answer, it is now (alas) that I meet the full of my mishapp, being denied
both death and life, by her to whom, of all the world, I have most desiered to
make declaration of obedience in any sort, what so ever. Alas why stay you to
ridd me from tormente, and your self out of care to behold any more this
desolat knight, who (denied to participat other favor) accomptes it a last
felicity to give up the ghost in your presence, wherewith fyndinge no remorce
of stubborn disdain in his mistres, who in all this time would not give him ye
favor of a simple look of the eye, and much less dispose her self to
answer in any sort to his co^plaintes, felt such war between the force of
his passion, and debilitye of his senses, being void of natural strength,
that in kissing her foot, he fell into a deadly sown, pronouncyng only these
words with the departure of his breath, ah feeble reward of unfeigned loyaltye.

Roderico amassed no less with the tragical farewell of his friend, then moved
with just anger against the unseemly tyranny of Geniuera, commanded
certain of his company to restore the trance of Diego, and with the rest
addressed him to the merciless gentlewoman, whom he threatened in this sort.
If the contynuance of thy crueltye, force me to Roderico threatens Geniuera.
change affection, assure thy self (detestable woman and enemy to the virtue
of all your sect) thou shalt not escape without the hier of the wrong
wherewith thou abuseste the honor which is offered the: makes thou such
conscience to yield compassion or admit the honest service of so noble a
gentleman? as this presented with such humility, that earste (without regard
of honesty or virtue), committed thy self and honor (as a fugitive) to the
government of a ronagate stranger? what crueltye can be greater? or by what
reason can thou challenge other ame^des or consideration of the wrong thou
have unjustly conceived, then an humble prostitutio^ with so many tears in
token of repentance? And for thy part, what canste thou desyere more of this
gentleman, the^ in forgiving the falte of thy false co^tracte with thy last
minion, not only to forbear to enter into suspicio^ touching thy unseemly
ronnyng away with an unknown villeine, but also craving the guerdo^ of his
constancy, is at point to sacrafice his life to appaise thy anger, and yield
the contentment, for end, I advise you to change opinion, least I co^mitt to
as many morsels thy desloial body, as this woeful knight not long since, made
bloddie division of his unhappy hawke, the only cause of his present
distress, and by your own folly, ready to give you a title of the most
tyrannouse and arrogant gentlewoman that is, neither have I begone this
enterprise, to leave it imperfect, or give it over, with this success,
wherefore seeing you take pleasure in extremities, I will feed your delight with
the offer of love or death, whereof as I give you the benefitt of the choice, so
I swear unto you, by him that is not ignorante of my intent, that if you
refuce the first, you shall not fail in this place to pass under the sentence
of the last, wherein my self will not fear to discharge thoffice of the fatal
minister, in embruyng my hands in the blood of her, whose folly only causes
the death of one of my dearest friends.

Thies threats dismayed nothing the malicious Geniuera, nor abated any part
of her presumptuouse arrogancy, for who had seen the fyerie regardes of her
eyes, the knittynge of her brows, whettyng of her teethe, closinge her
delicate fingars, with other braueries exceeding far the simplicity of
such tender years, unexperienced asyett in thassaltes and malice of an adverse
fortune, would have said she hadd rather procured terror to Roderico, then
given place to his fearful offer or somounce of love or death, defyenge also
the rigor of his authority with thies terms. Like as (thowe kaitife knighte
says she) he that is once thorough bathed in the suddes of ynnocente blodde,
is so fleshed and hardened in villenie, that no act of detestation seames any
sin to him, So it is no merueile if thowe, which haste committed unnatural
slaughter of one, whose true virtue exceded the flattering fame of thy
renown, and gave no place to the integretie of life, art not without fear to
committ me to the same guide, least in sufferynge me to live, thou could
not auoyce the justice which I am to procure upon the injury I have received,
besides I am here ready to lay my head upon the block of execution, rather
then to give the honor of my virginity to any, saying the cursed hands have
deprived me of him to whom both the tree and fruit did only apperteine,
neither do I tremble in the remembrance of the stroke of death, how cruel so
ever it appear, for that I shall the rather stand affore the troane from
whence is granted all vengaunce to such wretches as thou art: ha God, seeing
thou art righteouse why doste thou not thonder justice upon the wrong which
thies outlawes have don thy ynnocente hand maid, Ah traitor Roderico persuade
thy self that thou canste not offer me so cruel a death, as I am most
ready to endure the tormente, hoping the same shall serve hereafter as the
only cause and mean of thindifferent destructiou of thy self, and him, for
whom thou trauellest thus in vain: here her woman and page began to persuade
her to pity on the behalf of the knighte, that suffered such passion for her
sake, with consent to the honest requests of Roderico, solicitynge her so
frankelye towchynge thextremities of them both, that she entered into terms
of reprehencion against their honest meaning: will you (says she) be
either enchaunted with the feigned tears of this deloyall, who passioneth him
self upon creditt, or stand in awe of the tyrannouse threats of this morder
or whose villainy with covered face, has taken away the life of your
master? Ah unhappy girl that I am, it is now alas that I feel the heavy
hands of fortune, whose malice has not only put me beetwene the hands
of him, whom I hate no less, then I have already experienced his dyssembled
love, but also, in doubling my mishap, assaileth me with the sinister
perswacions of my servants and co^panio^s of care, who ought rather to allow
my resolucion in death, then prefer motion in any sort touching my consent to
requests of no less corruption, then them selves be infected, who solicit in
so bad a ca^e, Ah love, I prove to late alas thinfydelytie of thy promise,
fyndinge so bad a recompense, for so dutiful obedience, to yield at thy
sommonce, and so slender defense, for such as commit them selves faythfullye
to the gouernmente of thy lore, why should nature be more curious to frame us of
a more delicate molde, tempered with a mettel of fragilitie, then careful to
leave us armor of resistance against thassaltes of fortune? for if I had not
had a perle of flattering affection painted in my face, I had not tasted ye
beginning of a pleasure, whose dollorous farewell for ever, brings more cause
of greeff, then thapprehencion at the first engendered parfecte contentment, for
being alas upon the point to Sipp of the sugared cup, with exspectacion to
feed of the fruit of my pleasant attainte: Lo, how traiterus love serves me
with dishes of mortal annoye, and in place of the deynties which others find
in the end of their long hope, it is I that am presented with the banquet of
al bitter confections, which makes me hear resign and declare my fatal
testament upon thinconstancye of that pleasante follye, whom, as I leave at
liberty to make his gain of others, as well as he has dallied with me, so I
rejoice in thexchaunge of so great an evil, for so present a consolacion as
death, in whom I hope to find no less contentment and quiet, then the other
has assailed me with diuersatie of passion. Retire oh cursed mishap, to the end
that dyenge by thy means, I may live without the in the other world, wherein
place of a thousand annoyes, which (if I should consent to longer life) thou
have yet to thonder upon me, I shall be sewer of eternal reapose, norished with
thinuisible, food which god ympartes to his Angels and souls assistinge his
heavenly paradise. Come death and do thine office upon this wretched girl,
who attendes the sharpnes of thy darte, to preuente the ^earcinge arrows of
mine aduersarye, Ah poor heart deuoyde of hope, am desperate touching the
consommacion of thy desyers, cease hensfurth to wish the fruytion of longer
term, saying destenie, love, and life, are determined to dysmisse me here
hence, to sewe for peace elsewhere, and embrase the ghost of him, whose lif was
sacrafized to the deloyaltie of this wretch, who also for his part, not
satisfied with the blod of ynnocencye, takes no compassion upon my tears which
I wish to distyll by such abundance, that in ouerflowing the vital paxtes in
me, he might see me perish in his presence, drowned with thinundacion of
undeserved sorrow, proceeding by his wickedness: wherewith her eyes performed her
desire with such plenty of tears, that there was not one of the company
voyed of compassion on the hehalfe of the dollor which tormented her, not
ceassing notwithstanding to persuade her to pity toward that poor Diego, who
being newely recovered by the diligence of thassistance, sprinkling fresh
water of the fountain upon his face, did no sooner lift up his sorrowful
lyddes, beholdinge the lamentable passion of his mistres, with certain
likelehodes he espied, showing an increase of her disdain toward him, but he
retired to his former debilitie, fallinge down dead between the arms of such
as suported him, and albeit he was eftsoon restored, yet the force of his
passion assailed him still with three or four mortal panges one in the neck of
an other, in such sort, as the whole company gave judgment of his death,
amongst the which Roderico, was not the least amassed who greuing
indifferently with thobstinate cruelty of Geniuera, and present peril of his
dear fre^d Diego, was in long debate what pollecie to use to qualify the one,
and prevent the danger of the other, he persuaded, that if he killed the
willful Geniuera, he should also give end to the days of Diego, for that upon
the view and remembrauce of the one, depended the life of the other, and so in
doing no good to any, he should commit doble offense to god and the world,
both in spottinge his soul with uncivil morder, and also to become the author
of his death, in whose life he reaposed his most worldly felycitie, on the other
side, ye untowardness of the girl argued her intractable in such sort as he
desiered, which confirmed the continual martirdom of his friend, whose
distress as it moved him to such inward remorce, that to procure his
deliuerye he made no conscience to light a candle before the devil, so, he
gave a new charge upon the good will of Geniuera, with gentle perswacions,
lainge before her, what virtue ought to appear in such tender and delicate
years, and how greatly the vice of ingratitude defaced the renown of a
gentlewoman assisted with cruelty without reason, wherein gaininge no less
then if he had never put the devise in execution, he retired to thextremitie of
his former threats, and last pollecie, swearinge that she should find no
difference between the sommonce and effect, seeing that by her death he should
give end to her disdain, and desolate state of his friend, whom as he doubted
not, would deserne in time, what commodity it were to purge the air of such
contagiouse filthes of ungrateful arrogancy, so he was also of opynion that
time would yield commendacion to his fact, chiefly for that, in preseruinge ye
honor of a family, he thought it more expediente to exterminat the two
principal offenders, then to reserve the life of either of them for an utter
extinction of the glory of the whole house, wherefore, regarding the rest of
his train, he commanded to lay hands of the obstinate gentlewoman with her
two companions with charge to use no less mercy in their several executions
then the chiefeste of the three extended pity to the amarus knighte which he
thought would yield up the ghost before her.

The Lady hearing the sentence diffinitiue of her life, escr^ed the morder
with open mouth, as if she had exspected some succor to defend her from
death, wherein her hope was frustrate, for the deserte fostred no other
company but such as were ready in the place to commit execution. The page
and poor Chambriere held up their hands for mercy to Roderico, who fainyng
an ympedimente in his hearing, made a sign to his men to put effect to his
commandment. Geniuera, entreating for the lives of her page and woman,
desiered that their ynnocentie might not do penance for the offense which she
had don, crauyng with great humility that the punishment might be performed
upon her, from whom the falte (if it be a matter meritorious of blame says
she for a woman to keep her faith to her husband) is derived, and yield justice
to thies infortunat wretches least thexecution of their ynnocenti^ increase
your detestable offense, oh says she with her hands and eyes beholding the
heavens, thou my most dear and lawful husband, whose soul I see walkyng in
the midst of the loyal lovers, what better proffe canste thou have of the
sincerity of my love, then to see me lay my body upon thalter of ymmolation
to untimely death for thy sake, neither shalt thou for thy part, oh boocher
and mortal morderour of my carcass, to whose cruelty my destenie has
consented in quenching thy thirst with the blodd of a pure maid, glorify
hereafter to have forced the heart of a simple gentlewoman, and much less
made a breach into her honor either by terrible threats or sugared
perswations, upon which last words notwithstanding attended such arguments
of terror, that a man would have thought that the veraye remembrance of
death, hadd somewhat quallified her vehemence, and mortified the greatest part
of her former furies Geniuera be ginneth to show arguments of compassion.
Dom Diego, by this time came to him self and seeing the discourse of the
tragedye ready to present his last act with the death of his fair mistres
Geniuera la blonde, was driven to force him self to speak for the life of
her, whose cruelty had committed him allmoste to the panges of extreme
danger, wherefore staynge the diligence of such as had the charge of
execution he addressed him to Roderico, with this request. diego sevveth for
the life of Geniuera.


My lord and great friend the present experience of your rare frendshypp, has
made so lyberall a prooff of your undoubted meaning toward me, that, if I
should live the age of a whole world I should not be hable to discharge the
bonds of your desert, So considering the cause of this misfortune, procedes
only of the malice of mine own destenie, and that it is a vanity to contend
with the things which the heavens have determined upon us, I beseech you by
the virtue of your honor, and for a confirmation of all the good tornes you
have done me, to grant me yet one request, which is, that in pardonning the
life of this gentlewoman and her company, you will return them to the place
from whence you brought them, with no less assurance and saffetie, then if
you guided your miserable Dom Diego, for my part, being fully resolved not to
keep war with my destenies, I am persuaded to a contentement touching my
lot, assuring you, for the rest, that the sorrow which I see she suffers,
gives me more cause of passion, then ye greef which I endure by her means,
troubles me, let her live in peace and me in exspectation, to receive end of
my torments by the devouring knif, which is ordained to cut in sonder the
fillet whereupon dependes the fatal course of my cursed years, till which
time, I have sworn to keep reside^ce in these solitarye deserts, as well to
endure the penance of mine own indiscretion, as also to continue in secrett
prayer to thalmightye for the continual quiet of her, who may boldly vaunte to
be the mistres of the most loyal seruante that ever mente honor or service to
Lady. Who doubts in ye merueilous forces of love, let him be absolved with
this example, seeing that as the impressio^ (which we call love) has power to
bring to an unity the minds that lived in separation, make indissoluble
peace with the quarells which seame immortal, quallifying the rigor of those
hearts, which without this passion, no other pollecie could appaise, So when
he discovers, the full perfection of his effects, he preferres such a
facility in things which earste seamed impossible, that by his only mean,
they become neither dangerous to pursewe, nor hard to obtain, which appeared
rightly in this young Lady, in whom as the sinister conceit of a former
Ielowsie, her affected zeal contracted to an other, with her just cause of
anger for his death, had engendered a disdain to Dom Diego, an extreme desire
to revenge her wrong upon Dom Roderico, and by the same mean to end her own
life, So love remouinge the veil that blinded the eyes of her understanding,
and breakinge thadamante rock planted in the middeste of her stomach, Her heart
brought her in one instante to behold with open eyes, the constancy, patience
and perseverance of her first and most loyal servant, whose last prayer and
intercession on her behalf, stirred up in her more remorce the^ al ye services
of court or penance in the painful wilderness were hable to prefer, whereof she
exposed a present effect, in castinge her arms a bout the neck of the
desperate knight, to whom she forbear no sorts of kisses nor amarus
embrasinges, seamynge no less passioned with joy and love on his behalf, then
earste he seamed plunged in despair and sorrow, ballancing indifferently
between life and death in his presence, neither was she hable to pronownce any
word upon the soddayne, till (being restored to the use of her tongue) by the
discontynuance of her trance, she excused her former rigor with terms of
humylitie, and desyeringe pardon of the follies where Ge niue^a e^ ^useth her

with she had abused his patience, offered her self hereafter to be the slave
and servant of his shadow, taking thassista^ce of thym perfections in love to
be in some sort contrybutarye to her falte, for that (says she as love has
this vice of nature, that such as account them selves to see most clear are
they which most often commit greatest faltes by ignorance, So besides the
confession of the wrong I have don you so many ways, Lo I am ready to abide
the punishment of your own iudgemeut, without craving any dispense of justice
or moderacion of penance for any respect of favor, And albeit (for my part)
I have not escaped without passion, but yt the storms of aduersatie which you
have seen me endure, have driven me to thuttermost of my patience, yet I my
self happy to have passed that away, for thexperience I have made of two
effects of verteous extremities the one of constant loyalty in you, which only
has right to chaleng ye crown of glory, from him that sacrafized himself upon
the blodie body of his Lady, who in dyenge so, gave end to his annoyes, where
you have chosen a kind of languishynge, life of more hard tolleracion a
thousand times, then the sharp arrows of death, the other consistes in the
clemency where with you have mortefied so well the rage of your adversaries,
that I, which erst hated you to death, am now so vanquished by your courtesye,
that I account mine honor and life, of to small value to requite your merit,
wherein also I acknowledge a debte to Seigneur Roderico, whose wisdom makes me
ashamed of my folly, in resisting his rightful demand, touching the
releeffe of your undeserved destresse, whereunto as he would have replied with
semblable humylitie, Dom Roderico, prevented his meaning, in embrasinge them
both, with peculiar commendacion to their virtues, and special thanks to the
goodness of their fortune, for that with out peril of honor, they had passed that
dangerus passage, aduising them to return with him to his castle, from whence
he said he would give warning to their mothers, to whom he also undertook to
cooler thaccidente with some other circumstance of feigned substance. where upon
they mounted on horsbacke, leaving the stately hospital, to the next hermyt,
and using, easy journeys, they took away the tediousnes of the way with the
pleasant devises, which passed between the two lovers, embrasing one an other in
honest sort, as a simple recompense of their long and weary annoyes, till
time, with the consent of the church, gave authority to consommat the rest of
their desiers. from the house of Roderico, was advertisement given to the two
Lady mothers, in equal care for the loss of their children excusing the
secret departure of Geniuera in that she went to see Dom Diego lyinge sick in
a castle of his friend Seigneur Roderico,, where (if it pleased them to give
their consent) the marriage should be performed, wherein there needs no pithie
solycitors to neither of the widows, for that, for the more honor of the
feast and contentmente in the alliance, they failed not there in parson at the
day appointed, where the marriage was performed with pompp according to the
magnificence of both their houses, And so it is to be thought, that the storms
and torments past endured by them both, yielded this conclucion of other taste,
then they which without painful travail in the presence of love possess, the
first day, the full of their desiers, whose pleasures certainly, as they
resemble the condition of him, who norished all the days of his life in deintie
fare, cannot judge so well of delight, as he that some times finds want of
such delicatie, so also an extreme thruste, makes us find the wine more
pleasant, and a long fasting gives a better taste to our meat, neither is
love without annoye, any other thing, then a cause without an effect, for he
that will takeawaye the paynfull traueills and long suit, robbes the lover of
the praise of his constancy, and does wrong to the glory of his pursewt,
seeing that he only is worthy to wear the crown of tryumphe, who encountringe
all conflictes does reapose more assurance in the virtue of his constancy,
then fear (in any sort) the malice of any fortune Let this be then the
mirror of loyal lovers in detestacion of thimpudicitie of such, which fear
not to give a charge where they find good countenance, and ready retire at the
first repuise, ympartinge also a participacion of worthy rebuke to thothers,
who to content the humor of their fond affection, do account it a virtue to
exchange their former generositie, with a gloriouse title to be reputed as
true and faithful champions of love, for yt, the perfection to love truellie,
co^sistes not in passion or pyning cares, and much less comes he to the full
of his desire by sighs, dollorus regardes or lamentable exclamacio^s
accordi^ge to the Spanyard, nor so lemne vows to visitt far places for her
sake, or childishe fears, as the amarus Italyan to whom also we may ad this
barcelonia^ Diego, who thought, through his desperate pena^nce in the deserts of
Pireneus, to reclayme the goodwill of his mystres, seeing that as in all our
affairs we ought not excede the institucion of virtue, so she chiefly is to
bear a swaighe in ye knot of this indissoluble amytie, besides, we se hear,
that the diligence of a perfect friend, is of more force in those cases then
all the passions, panges, letters of pithie perswacion orother ymportunyties
whatsoever, tolerated in matters of love, neither can a man judge what a
treasor it is to have an assured friend, till either the want of such a
Jewel, or experience of his frendshipp, make him taste the benefit of so great
and rare a gift, seeing that a true friend, being the second part or one
moyetie of our selves, is always so guided by a natural Sympathya of affection
toward him who^ he loves, that he reioyseth in the pleasure and commodytie
of his friend, and is ready to participat with his aduersaty when fortune is
disposed to play any part of her accustomed mobilitie, whereof albeit we find
not at this day, so many thoroughly perfect in that virtue, as the whole world
on all parts swarms with infynitye of the contrary faction, which the
Grecian philosopher calls Microphilos, That is a demye or half friend
according to thinglishe phrase.

Yet am I moved by diverse occasions, to pass over such The conclucion of the

discourse, contentinge my self that the diuersatye of my histories, give
recreacio^ to the reader, without stayinge to infer authorities which may
touch or sift the conscience of any. And observing chiefly as nere as I cold
an order of truth, my second respect was to prefer such examples as might
best serve to instruct our youth, who as they may see hear the faltes of
fragilitie punished with shame, loss of honor, cruel death, and perpetual
infamy to their posterity, So have they also of the contrary, special
patterns of virtue, alluringe them to ymytacion of semblable honestye, with
diversity of authorities prouinge the reward of virtue, and virtuous lyuinge,
whereof let all degrees make their proffit as they think good, according to
the flee in the milk, fedinge of the good and virtuous fruit, and leave the
rest as poison and bitter dregs, to such as are wholly drowned in the
desiers of the flesh, and buried in a pit of worldly filthe, and as I have
seamed in some places to enterlarde this profane traslation with certain
testimonies out of sacred records, So I hope the same will the rather defend
th'integritie of mine intent against all objections, consideringe that the
most part of the simple and ignoraunte sort, are rather moved with such
examples, then reduced with the severe sentences of sum great philosopher or
reformed theologyan. Besides in these discourses of love, th'adulteror is putt
in remembrance of his fault, the morderer sees the reward of his iniquity,
he that yeldes to the sommonce of foul concupiscence is sewer to be touched
with the mark of infamy, and such as passioneth him self upon creadit, may
behold hear the meede of his follye, wherein for my part, as I grieve that
the world (at this present) swarmeth with so great a number of insensed men,
ready to dye for a pleasure of so small momente as the contentemente of the
body, So I wish that as in writynge thies tragical affairs, I have found
the falte of mine own life, that also the rest of the younglinges of our
country, in reding my endeavor, may break the sleep of their long follye,
and retire at last to amendment of life, least in remeyninge still in the
laborinth of sensuallitie, they serve not hereafter as a fable and stage play
to the posteritye of a multitude, for end, I exspecte no other hier of my
traueile, then that my diligence may seame thankful to her, to whose honor
and goodness I owe no less then all that I have.
