AN ADMONITION: To all such as shall intend hereafter to enter the state of
Matrimony godly, and agreeable to Laws.
FIrst, that they contract not with such persons as be hereafter expressed, nor
with any of like degree, against the law of God, and the laws of the Realm.

Secondly, that they make no secret contracts without consent and counsel of
their Parents or elders, under whose authority they be: contrary to Gods
Laws, and man's ordinances.

Thirdly, that they contract not a new with any other, upon divorce and
separation made by the Judge for a time, the laws yet standing to the
contrary.

Marriage is Honorable among all men, and the bed undefiled. But Whormongers and
Adulterers God will judge. Heb. 23. To avoid Fornication, let every Man have
his Wife; and let every Woman have her Husband. He that cannot contain, let
him marry. For it is better to marry then to burn. 1. Cor. 7. Unto the
married I command; not I, but the Lord: Let not the Wife depart from her
Husband: But if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled unto
her Husband. And let not the Husband put away his Wife. 1. Cor. 7. Leuitici.
xviij. and. vi. None shall come near to any of the kindred of his flesh to
uncover her shame: I am the Lord.

A man may not marry his

1 IT is to be noted, that those persons which be in the direct line ascendent
and descendent, cannot marry together, although they be never so far a
sunder in degree.

2 It is also to be noted, that Consanguinitie and affinity (letting and
dissoluing matrimony) is contracted as well in them, and by them which be of
kindred by the one side, as in and by them which be of kindred by both sides.

3 Item, that by the laws, Consanguinitie and affinity (letting and
dissoluing Matrimony) is contracted as well by unlawful company of man and
woman, as by lawful marriage.

4 Item, in contracting betwixt persons doubtful, which be not expressed in
this Ta^^, It is most sure, first to consult with men learned in the laws; to
understand what is lawful, what is honest and expedient, before the finishing
of their contracts.

Item, that no Parson, Vicar, or Curat, shall solemnize Matrimony out of his
or their Cure, or parish Church or Chapel: and shall not solemnize the same
in private Houses, nor lawless or exempt Churches, under the pains of the
Law, forbidding the same. And that the Curate have their Certificates, when the
parties dwell in diverse Parishes.

Item, the ^^nds of Matrimony ought to be openly denounced to the Church by
(...) Minister, three several Sundays or Feastiuall days, to the intent,
that who will and can allege any impediment, may be heard, and that stay may
be made till further trial, if any exception be made there against it, upon
sufficient caution.

7 Item, who shall maliciously object a frivolous impediment against a lawful
Matrimony, to disturb the same, is subject to the pains of the Law.

8 Item, who shall presume to contract in the degrees prohibited (though he do
it ignorantly) besides that the fruit of such copulation may be judged
unlawful, is also punishable at the Ordinaries discretion.

9 Item, if any Minister shall conioyne any such, or shall be present at such
contracts making, ought to be suspended from his Ministry for three years:
and otherwise to be punished according to the Laws.

10 Item, it is further ordained, that no Parson, Vicar, or Curat, do preach,
treat, or expound, of his own voluntary invention, any matter of controversy
in the Scriptures, if he be under the degree of a master of Art, except he be
licensed by his Ordinary thereunto, but only for the instruction of the
people, read the Homilies already set forth, and such other form of doctrine
as shall be hereafter by authority published. And shall not innouate or alter
any thing in the Church, or use any old rite or ceremony, which be not set
forth by public authority.

Set forth by the most reverend Father in God, Matthew Archbishop of
Canterbury, Primate of England, and Metropolitan.
