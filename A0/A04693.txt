An Apologye made by George Joy to satisfye (if it may be) w. Tindale: to
pourge and defend himself against (...) many sclaunderouse lies feigned upon
^^m in Tindals uncharitable and vnsober Pystle so well worthy to be prefixed
for the Reader to induce him into the understanding of his new Testament
diligently corrected and printed in the year of our lord. M. CCCCC. and
xxxiiij. in November.

I know and believe that the bodies of every dead man / shall rise again at
domes day.

Psalm.cxx. Lord / deliver me from lyinge lyppes / and from a deceatfull
tongue. Amen.

1535

How we were once agreed.
AFter that w. Tyndale had putforth in prynt and thrusted his uncharitable
pystle into many mennis handis / his frendis and mine understanding that I had
prepared my defense to pourge and clear my name which he had defamed and
defiled / called us together to move us to a co^corde and peace / where I
showed them my great grief and sorrow / for that he should so falsely belie and
sclaunder me of syche crimes which I never thought / spoke / nor wrote / and of
siche which I know well his own conscience does testifye the contrary / eue^
that I denied the Resurrection of the body / but believe it as co^sta^tly as
himself: and this with other heinous crimes which he impingeth unto me ^n his
pistle / nether he nor no man else shall never prove: wherefore except Tin. (said
I) will revoke the sclau^ders feigned upon me himself / I will (as I am bound)
defend my fame and name / which there is nothing to me more dear and leif And
to be short aftir many wordis: It was thus through the mocio^ of our fre^dis
concluded for our agreement and peace: The co^dycio^s of our agreement.
That I should for my part (a reason and rekenyng first given why I
translated this word Resurrectio i^to the life after this) permyt and leave my
tra^slacio^ unto the judgment of the learned in christis church. And T. on his
part should call agein his pistle into his hand / so to redress it / reform it
/ and correcke it from siche sclaunderous lies as I was therewith offended and
he could not iustifye the^ / that I should be therewith well co^te^ted / T.
addyng with his own mouth that we should with one accord in his next
testament then in printing in the stead of this uncharitable pistle wherewith I
was offended / salute the reders with one common salutacio^ to testifye our
co^corde: of these co^dicions we departed louyngly. Then after.v. or.vj. days
I came to Tin. to se the correccion and reformacio^ of his pistle / and he said
he never thought of it sense / I prayed him to make yt ready shortly (for I
longed sore to se it) and came agene to him after.v. or vj. days. Then he said
it was so written that I could not read it: and I said I was well aquainted with
his hand and should read it well enough: but he would not let me se it. Tindal
first breaks his promise.
I came agene the third time desyring him to se it / but then had he bethought
him of this cauyllacion contrary to the co^dicions of our agreement / that he
would first se my reasons and write agenst them ere I should se this his
reformacion and reuocacio^. Then thought I / sith my part and reasons be put
into the judgment of the learned / T. ought not to write agenst them till their
judgment be done / no nor yet then nether / sith he is content before these men
to stand to their judgment / and not to co^tende any more of this matter with
me. yet I came agene the fourth time / and to be short: he persisted in his
last purpose and would first se my reasons and write agenst them and then
leave the matter to the judgment of Doctor Barnes and of his fellow called
Hijpinus pastor of. s. nicholas parisshe in Ha^bourg / adding that he would
revoke that ever he wrote that I should deny the resurreccion. Then I told
one of the men that was present at the co^dicions of our agreement all this
matter: and wrote unto the other these answers that I had: so often seking upon
T. to be at peace and to stand to his promise / desyering the^ al to move him
and advise him to hold his promise / or else / if he would not / them not to
blame me though I defend my self and clear my fame which he has thus
falsely and uncharitably denigrated / deformed / and hurt. But in conclusion I
perceived that T. was half ashamed to revoke according to his promise all that
he could not iustifye by me / and with which I was so offended. wherefore sithe
he would not keep promise / I am compelled to answer here now for my self:
which I desire every indifferent reder to judge indifferently.

Tindals opinion of the souls departed.
And now first of all / because thou shall se more clearly (good reder) what
moved T. thus to belie me: to rage and rail upon me / and what is T. opinion
and doctrine as concerning the state of the soulis departed / and also that he
affirmed it constantly and defended the same unto my face when I resoned agenst
him more then once or twyse and proved him the contrary by the scriptures:
mouyng him to revoke his error (which doctrine to confute and put it out of
some me^nis headis / my conscience compelled of the truth of goddis word
caused me to english this word Resurrectio the life aftir this) have here
his own wordis in his answer to. m. Moris second book.

And when M. More proves that the saintis be in heaven in glory with christ
already sayng. More. lxxij. leif the second side.
If god be their God / they be in heaven: for he is not the God of the dead.

Here says Tind. that More steals away christis argument where with he
proves the Resurrection / that Abraham and all sayntis should rise again and
not that their soulis were in heaven: Tindal
which doctrine was not yet in the world / and with that doctrine he takes
away the resurrection quyte and makes Christis argument of none effect. For
when christ allegeth the scripture that god is the God of Abraham / and adds
to that god is not the god of the dead / but of the living: and so proves that
Abraham must rise again / I deny christis argument. and cetera.

The confutacion of Tindals opinion.
Joy.
Here is it manifest that T. vndersto^deth not this place of scripture / nether
knows whother cristis argument te^deth / nor yet the Saduceis opinion: The
co^futacio^ of Tyndals opinion.
and therefore no meruel though he gives not this word Resurrectio there his
proper significacio^ / of which ignorance this his error springs God so
suffering us to fall standing to miche in our own co^saightes / thynking our self
so highly learned / and to translate and write al things so exqsitely and
perfaitly that no man is able either to do it better or to correck our works:
Ti^dals argument.
whose argument is this. If the soulis of the faithful were in heaven / there
should be no resurrection of their bodies / which inconvenience to avoid / he
laith them down to sleep out of heaven as do the Anabaptists till domes day /
but here I meruell that Tin. is so scle^derly learned in the form of arguyng
that he se not how his antecede^ce may be true and co^seque^ce false: Thana
baptistys opinion off the soulis departed.
seeing that the contrary of his co^seque^ce is necessary / that is to weit /
there shall be the resurrection of the flesh: 1. corinthio. 15
Paul thus proving it. If Christ be preached to have risen / how happens
that some of you say thee is no resurrection? Tyndals argument is proved false.
As who should thus argew / Christ our head is risen: wherefore yt must needs
follow that his body which is his church shall rise ageyn. For wherefore should
the being in heaven of the soulis of Peter and Paul and of all saints / let
the resurrection of their bodies more then the being in heaven of Christis soul
those iij. days did let his resurrection? Tin. will say: They be al ready in
joy / and therefore there needs no resurrection. And I say / so was christis
spirit and yet he rose again. And I deny T. argument / For were they in never
so great joy / yet must their bodies rise again / or else he will make christ
a liar and his doctrine false. Mat. 5
Heaven and earth shall sooner pass away then one jot of god dis word shall
pass unfulfilled. The verite has said it and wryte^ it / co^cluding that our
bodies shall rise agein: wherefore there ca^ no co^dicionall an^cede^ce of T. nor
yet of any angel in heaven make this conclusion false.

But let us exame^ the text / and se the Saduceis opinion / unto the which
Christ answers so directly and so confuteth yt utterly. The Saduceis / as
writes that aunciau^t historiograph Josephus being himself a jew / in
his.xviij. book the.ij. ca. said that the soul of man was mortal and dyed with
the body: The Saduceis opinion.
acto. 23
and Paul co^firming the same to be their opinion / adds that they said there
were nether spirits nor angels: Paul declares the saduceis opinion.
so that to say there is nether spirit / (spirit properly is the soul
departed) nor aungel / is as miche to say as the soul is mortal / and no
life to be aftir this: and the Saduceis in denying the life aftir this / denied
by the same deny but only those two: that is / both spirit and angel: for
if they had denied by that word Resurrectio the general Resurrection to in
that place / so had they denied three disti^cte thingis: but Paul addyng /
Pharisei aute^ vtraque co^fitentur / but the pharisees grant them both two /
declares manifestly that they denied but only two thingis that is to say
both spirit and angel: for aftir this present life till domes day there is no
life of any creature but of these two creatures spirits and angels. And if by
this word Resurrectio Paul had vndersto^de^ as T. does the resurrection of
the flesh / he would not have said / the pharyses grant them both / but all
three. For this word vtraque as every latyne man knows / is spoken but of two
thingis only: but as for this my mind I leave it unto the judgment of the
learned. And now shall I prove yt by christis own answer / that the Saduceis
in those places of Math. Mark. and Luke / denied that there is any life aftir
this: mat. 22 mar. 12 luc. 20.
and so nether to be spirit nor angel / which is as miche to say as towching
the soul / it to be mortal. For if it should live aftir the departing / they
thought to have had taken christ in this trappe with their question of
those.vij. brethren / that they now being all a live aftir their death / should
have al seven together that one wife at once: for they said that al these.vij.
had her here. But christ answerde them directly according to their opinion:
and not aftir Tin. opinion of this word resurrectio / telling them that they
erred being ignorant of the scriptures and also of the power of god / which
power christ declares to consist in the p^seruing the dead a live / for
because out of god the father and christ the sone / being that vere life / all
life flows / ye and that into the dead: id. 5.12 1. ioa^. 5
which power to confirm into the confutacio^ of their opinion and their own
confusion: he alleged these scriptures exodi.iij. But first he told them of
the present state of the soulis departed / saying that in the the other life aftir
this they nether marye / nor ar married / but they ar as the angels of god in
heaven. Tindal In his exposition of. S. Ihon Pystle.
And yet says Tindal this doctrine was not then in the world / and what is
done with the soulis departed / the scripture make no mencio^ / but it is a
secret (says he) laid up in gods tresury. Joy.
It is verily a deep secret to him that is ignorant so many plain scriptures
which I shall here aftir bring in prouyng their state in heaven. Here is also
to be noted that christ in describing their present state / says in the
present tence. They mary not nor ar married / but ar like angels / ye egall
unto angels / and the sons of god says Luke cap. xx. But yet if Tindal will
say that the present tence is here taken for the future / and play boo pepe
with the tencis as he englissheth resuscita^tur shall rise again / and not are
revived or resuscited / yet must I ask him whether that the children of that
life and worthy that world (as Luke calls them) be not now more like angels
then they shall be aftir the resurreccion of their bodies? mar. 12
luc. 20.
me thinks that in this point / that they nether marye nor are married:
angels and the spirits be now both a like: and the children of the life or
the world where now the blessed live with Christ / are now more like angels
then they shall be aftir the resurrection of their bodies / for now they are
substances incorporal / immortal / and intellectual / and so be angels: but
then they shall be bodily substances having very flesh and bones which the
angels never had nor never shall have.

The text is declared.
But now let us hear the scryptures wherewith christ co^futeth their opinion
and proves the same thing that the saduceis denied. The text is her expended.
Crist considering what thing they denied / said unto them. De resurrectione
vero mortuoru^ / no^ legistis quoth vobis dictu^ est a deo / qui ait. Ego sum deus
Abraham. etc That is to say. As concerning the life of them that be dead have
ye not red what is told you of god saying: I am the God of Abraham / the god
of Isaac / and the god of Jacob: God is not the God of the dead / but of the
lyuinge. By this argument: god is the god of the living and not of the dead:
God is the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob ergo Abraham Isaac and Jacob are a
live: christ concludes planely / nothing else but that there is a life aftir
this whereyn the soulis departed live / which co^clusio^ since it is directly
made against the Saduces opinion / it must nedis follow that they denied in this
place that thing which christ proved / for christ was not so vncircu^specte
to prove one thing / they denying another / orels they might have well objected
saying: Sir what is this answer to our question? we ask the whose wife shall
she be at the general resurreccion of their bodies? and thou answerest us
nothing else nor prouest us any thing else with this scripture but that there is
a life after this wheryn the soulis departed now live: and so to be both
spirits and angels for that they be like angels: If the Saduces here had
denied cheifely and principally / by that word Resurrectio the general
resurrection / criste would have proved it the^ by scriptures / as well as he
here proved them the life of spirits separated from their bodies / and christ
re^dering the cause of his argument to confirm the same and to declare the
power of god in so p^seruing the dead a live says Omnes em^ illi viuu^t / all
me^ live in him / or by him. luc. 20.
Also it is to be noted diligently how that saint Mark for the inducyng of
that autorite of Moses / sets before the thing that yt proves in these
wordis saying. mar. 12
Ceteru^ de mortuis quod resuscitant no^ legistis in libro Mosi. etc. that is
to say. But as touching the dead / that they ar resuscited or they are all ready
alive (he says not that they shall be alive or shall rise again as T. in his
dilligent last correccio^ turns the presente^ce into the future: and the verb
passive into a neuter to stablissh his error thus corrupting the text. And
like wise he plaith with the verb in Luke and in Mark he englissheth the
verb of the pretertence resurrexerint / for the future. So feign would he
wrest the words from their natyue sense to serve for his error) have ye not
red in exodo what Moses says etc? so that he induces the autorite to prove
that they are a live / and nothing less then to prove the resurreccion of the
flesh. I wou^der wherefore T. flitteth from the text in these places. Here
may every man se / that these word Resurrectio in this place / as in diverse
other places of scripture is taken for the life aftir this wheryn the souls
now live till the resurrection of their bodies as testifyeth Ioa^: Resurrectio
has two significations
apo. 20
And Tin. not knowing this significacio^ or not willing to se it / is gretely
to blame to write and so belie and sclau^der me sayng: That for because I thus
giving the word in his place his very signification / I do deny the
resurreccion of the slesshe: which I never doubted of but believe it as
co^sta^tly as he / I have p^ached and taught it / and so interp^ted it where it
so signifies and confess it openly as every man may se that read my workis /
and as Tindals own conscience testifyeth the same. For though this place
proves not directly the resurrection of the bodies yet are there many places
moo that prove it clearly: as does all the.xv. chapter of the first Pystle to
the Corin. where I englisshe it Resurreccion / and in the article of our Credo:
but in John / and in the.xj. cap. to the Hebrwes where the word signifies the
life of the spirits departed / there I englissh it as the very word signifies
to put the reder out of doubt and to make it clear lest he be seduced and err
with Tind. beleuyng that the soulis sleep out of heaven: when sleep in
scripture is properly and only vnderstande^ of the body which shall be awaked
and rise again.

A rekeninge is given of my tra^slatio^.
For I did translate this word Resurrectio in to the life aftir this / in
certain placis / for these two causes principally. For two causes is this
word Resurrectio so translated.
First because the latin word / besides that it signifies in other places the
Resurreccion of the body / yet in these it signifies the life of the spirits
or souls departed as christis answer unto the Saduceis / and John declare.
mat. 22 apo. 10
Seco^daryly / because that agenst the Anabaptistis false opinion / and agenst
their error whom Erasmus reproves in his exposicio^ of the Credo which say
the resurrection of the souls to be this: that is to weet / when they shall be
called out of their preuey lurking places / in which they had been hyd from the
time of their departing unto the resurreccion of their bodies / because (I
say) that agenste these erroneouse opinions / these places thus truly
translated make so myche and so planely / that at this word Resurrectio the
life of the spirits aftir this / their false opinion falls and is utterly
condemned.

The confutacion of Tindals opinion.
Here it is (...) to the grunde of our cause Surgo to rise. Maneo to abide or
endure.
And if Tin. would look beter upon his book and follow not so miche his own
wit / he should find that the hebrew word which commonly is translated into
this vbe Surgo / the same some time saint Jerome translated into Maneo / as in
Isaye. Verbu^ dn^i manet in eternu^ / The word of the Lord endures for ever
/ some time into these vbis sto / or co^sto / as Isaye xlvj. And some time
into these vbis Pono / co^stituo / excito / facio stare in vita / vel seruo in
vita as in exo. cap. ix. of Pharao. Et profecto ideo posui te / vl excitauite /
seruaui te in vita / vel feci te stare / superstite^ te volui esse plagis meis:
vt ostenda^ in te fortitudine^ mea^ etc. that is to say: Doutlesse or verily
for this cause yet have I set and co^stitute the or stered the up / p^serued
the alive to receive my plages to declare my strength upon the and to show
that my name might be known thorowte all the world: of the which verb there
comes Surrectio and so Resurrectio whose rote and original since it has these
so many diverse significacio^s / it must nedis follow that the nowne diriuyed
out thereof have as many / and so to signifye that permane^t and very life or
the preserving of them still a live / which significacio^ agrees in all these
placis of these three eua^gelistis / for they all tell one and the same storye.
Resurrectio has mo significations then one.
If T. will englisshe this verb Resurgo every where to rise again in body /
so shall he translate it falsely / corruppe the text and bring the reder into
no small error / as once did one preacher in a sermon / expownyng this verse
of the first psalm. Ideo no^ resurge^t impij in iudicio etc. englysshing yt
thus: wherefore the ungodly shalnot rise again in the judgment. whereat many were
offended and astonished / and some believed that the ungodly should not rise again
at the general judgment. which word in that place Philip me lanchton /
Martyne Bucere / Conradus Pellicanus / zwinglius / Ca^pensis / (men of greter
knowleg / higher lerning / and more excellent judgment in holy scripture / in
the hebrew / greek and latyne then Tindal is or ever lykely to be) translate it
into these verbis: co^sistunt / constant / perstant / dura^t / viuunt: redering
the use thus. Ideo no^ constant no^ co^sistu^t no^ dura^t / or no^ viuu^t impij
in iudicio etc. that is to say the ungodly abide not / nor endure / nor live
in the company of the just at the judgment: whether it be in the general or
particlare judgment of every soul departed: as Rabbi Kimhy cyted of Bucere
upon that same verse takes Iudicium in that place: Also Bartholomeus
Vesthemerus gathering out of the learned me^nis workis / in his book entitled
Collectanea co^muniu^ troporum / the diverse significacio^s of wordis / and the
common phrasis in the scripture: declares in the.iij. c. leif / in how many
places these word Resurrectio is taken for the ferme permane^t life of the
soulis now deperted: And He^richus Bullyngerus / a man of great lerning and
greter judgment both in the scriptures and the tongues co^senteth with me in
the significacio^ of this word Resurrectio in these placis. Many words in
diverse places of the scripture have diverse / ye some contrari significacio^s:
which thing if it be not diligently observed of the tra^slatour tra^slatinge
one for a another / he may sone err and corrupt the text into the great perel
of the reder. I a^ sure that T. will not every where englisshe this word
Bn^dico a like / as to bless: for in some places it signifies to curse / nor
yet englesshe pctm^ syn^e / for in some placis it signifies the cow or calfe
offered up for sin / and so the self sacrifice offered up for the sin / and
the expiacio^ and clensing or purgacio^ from sin / as is christ himself so
called. But here will Tin. let great scorn that I being so unlearned in the
hebrewe and other tongues (as I am in very deed) should take upon me to point
him to this mark which either of ignorance he saw not / or else of a self
will and froward mind would not se yt.

Furthermore he finds himself sore aggreued for that I have so englysshed
this word Resurrectio in the.xj. chap. to the hebrews in this place. heb. 11
Some men were racked / and yet refused they to be redeemed or delivered / to
thente^t they might have potiore^ resurrectione^ / says the text: which T.
englissheth a beter resurrection: where it is plain that he englissheth it
falsely / for since he takes here Resurrection for the resurrection of the
flesh: and this comparison is here between two resurreccio^s only / it must
nedis follow that aftir T. there should be two resurreccio^s of our bodies / of
the which one is beter then the the other: and these me^ so stretched and racked
having experience of the worse resurrection despised the delyuera^ce to obtain
the beter. Here may ye se in what absurdytes and errors Tin. wrappeth himself
for falsely tra^ssating this word Resurrectio in this place: wherefore
according to his own desire in the end of his first new testament desyering
all that be able to mende that at was amysse in it and to give the wordis
(where he did it not himself) their right significacions: for he confesses
eue^ there that his first tra^slacion was a thing borne before the time / rude
and imperfit / rather begun then fynisshed / not yet having her right shape.
This I say his own desyer and confession and my conscience so compelled me
and caused me where I saw siche notable fautes to me^de them / lest so many
false books thruste into me^nis ha^dis might either stay the reader or else
seduce him into any error. Therefore (I say) I englisshe it thus / that they
might receive rather the beter life: for the comparison consists between
this life / of which they were werie / and the the other beter life aftir this
which they so ferue^tly desiered that they refused to be delivered from their
pains. And eue^ in the next line before T. himself / magry his tethe: was
compelled so to english the same word calling yt life / and not the
resurreccion. whereby thou may se (good reader) of what stomach and mind he
writes agenst me. Let every man look in his first translacio^: and there shall
he read this text. Mulieres acceperu^t exresurrectio^e mortuos suos / thus
englysshed of himself. The women received their dead to life again. Lo here
resurrectio aftir T. signifies life / and not the general resurrection: ergo
T. aborreth this word resurreccion and denies the resurrection of the flesh
/ these be his arguments against me / wherewith (if he thinks them so strong)
I do here snare and hold him fast / till he be able to loose himself. But yet
I never red that / ex / should signifye / ad / as to translate ex resurrectio^e
to life / but rather from that life. Also in this we differ here: for he
calls resurrection the present life of this world / which is no life in
conparison to the the other / and I call it the life of the the other world wherein the
blessed soulis live with criste till domes day: and there aftir evermore with
their bodies to. But yet in his last new testame^ so diligently corrected and
compared with the greek / because he would vary and swerve fro my englysshi^g
(ye from the truth of the word) he goyth about perambages with a long
circu^locutio^ / saying raised from death to life again: lo here ex
resurrectio^e signifies raised unto this life age^ / he had lever thus play bo
peep with.ij. wordis / turning ex into ad / and the nowne into a participle /
and the very life of the spirits separated i^to the dedly shadow of these world
/ the^ to say the truth with me. Here may ye se what shifts these man makes
to discord fro me: ye rather from the truth.

But let us return to Tin. his answer to M. More in the said place and se
with what faithfulness and reverence he allegeth Paul. Tindal is confuted.
There he says that Paulis argument is this / If there be no resurreccion / we
be of al wretches the most miserablest Here may ye se how T. runs riot of
his 1. corinthio. 15.
own wit falsely belying Paul having no respect unto his book / nor yet dew
reverence unto holy scriptures alleging the^ / It would have well become^ as
great a clerk as he is / first to have turned to Paul's argument and looked
more diligently whyther Paul had so knytte it together / and not to have
coupled paulis consequence with an an^cede^ce of his own ymaginacio^ / For these
is Paulis argument. Tindal belieth paul.
If we have but in this life only our hope fastened in christ / so were we
miserablest of al me^. He says not If there were no resurrection / for so might
his antecede^ce be true and his conseq^nce false: for admitted that as T.
allegeth hi^ / there were no resurreccion / yet follows it not that the elect
now departed being (as now at last he is compelled to grant) in no worse
case the^ christ's spirit was from his death till he rose again / be most
miserable of al me^: for they that be yet a live / and they that be dead and
not received i^to Abraha^s bosom but in hell in torme^tis be miche more
miserable. But what says T. to his own argument? for Paul made it not / verily
eue^ thus. Nay Paul thou art unlearned / Go to m. More and learn a new way.
Tindal
We be not most miserable though we rise not agene / for our soulis go to
heaven as soon as we be dead. Joy.
This says Tin. yroniously in a mok as though it were false / that our soulis
as soon as we be dead should go to heaven. Tindal
And ar there in as great joy as Christ that is risen again. In heaven dare I
say that they be: Joy.
ye and that in joy / if they dye in the lord / but whether in as great joy
as christ himself / let More and T. dispute it. Tindal
And I meruel says T. that Paul had not counforted the Thessalonia^s with
that dotryne / if he had wist it / that the soulis of their dead had been in
joy as he did with the resurreccion that their dead should rise again. Never
meruel at it Tindale / for Paul thought this present co^solacion sufficient
and could have cou^forted them then with many mo / as with this of Christ. Joy.
Ioa^. v. that who so here my word and believe in him that has sent me / has
life everlasting and shall not come into co^de^pnacio^ / but is passed over
from death to life. which co^solacio^ because in that place and at that time
Paul spoke it not: is it a good argument that there was non siche? ye must
beware (sir) how ye argew a negatiuis / for siche kind of arguments be the
worste and feblest that ye ca^ make. It is a naughty argume^ / Paul did not
confort the^ with that doctrine / but with another as good / ergo that doctrine
was false or was not in the world? ye may not judge Paul as ignorant as you be
in it / because he did not then and there express it for in other places he
declares and techeth that doctrine plenteously enough.

Crij. lief the second side.
Now read Tinda. wordis in his answer to M. Moris fourth book / and look
whether he grau^teth not plainly that the soulis sleap till domes day / and
whether he calls not the doctrine that they should live ever: heythen and
flesshly doctrine of the Philosophers joined with the popis doctrine. And again
in the.cxviij. leif where unto he remitted the reader in his table with this
sentence / Soulis sleap / belying Christ and his Apostles saying that they
taught nonother / And yet both there Crviii. leif.
in his answers and in his exposition upon John's Pystle upon this text. And now
little children abide in him / that when he shall apeare. etc. He says yt is a
deep secret laid up in gods tresury And yet a little before upon this text.
Tindals words fight agenst themself.
And he is the satisfaccion and. He brings in Paul telling a long tale in
his sleap (if Tin. doctrine be true) and makes Paul at last to confess that
he himself with other sayntis be in heaven / contrary to his own saying / read
the.xvj. line the first side of the.xij. leif of the expocicyon of that text.
And he is the satisfaccio^ and. And there shall thou se how Tindals wordis fight
agenst them self. Finally if yt be so deep a secret / no scripture to make
mention of their state / I wounder what made Tindale so bold to say and to
write yt to / that they sleap / and that they be not in heaven: and now at last
to think they be in no worse case then was cristis spirit aftir his death
until his resurrection. Aftir I had seen these places and known Tindals
erroneouse opinion I resoned with him as we walked together in the feeld more
then once or twyse: bryngyng against him siche textis as m^ thought / proved
plainly agenst him / as when christ answerde the theif hangyng by his cross
saying. Luc. 23
This day thou shall be with me in paradyse. where I said It is manifest that
if christ had that day commended his spirit into his fathers ha^dis in heaven
(as he did in deed) and promised that the spirit of the theif should be with his
spirit (for their bodies were not together) it must nedys follow that his spirit
was with cristes spirit in heaven. And to express the place more plainly
christ added saying / In paradyse / which is not else then in heaven. paradyse
is taken for heaven. 2 cor. 12.
which one autorite albe it / it had been sufficient for any mane that would
have admytted and received the sengle and plain veryte of cristes word / yet I
brought forth christ's wordis again describing the state of the faithful and
unfaithful aftir this life / saying. Math. viij. I tell you verily that many
shall come from the east and west and shall sit down to eat with Abraham Isaac
and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven / that is to say / shall be associated unto
Abraham and Isaac to be part takers of their joy and fruicyon in heaven / but
the children of the kingdom of the devil shall be cast forth into extreme
derknesses where shall be wepinge and gnasshing of tethe. This sitting down at
table with Abraham / is not else but Abraha^s bosom into which all that
resembled Abraham in faith / aftir their departinge were received / as ye may
se of Lazarus. Abraha^s bosom.
Luke.xvj. where the state of the elect and of the reprobated immediately after
their death is described / thelecte to be borne of angels into Abraham's bosom
as was Lazarus / and the reprobated to be cast into hell into torme^tis with
the rich gloto^. Then alleged I Paul saying: 2. Cor. 5 Erthy ^abernacle /
our corruptible body.

Heavenly tabernacle / is that joy and gloriouse presence of God.


For we know that if our erthye tabernacle where in we dwell were destroyed /
yet have we a perpetual ma^sion not made with handis / in heaven: of these
mansio^s all ready prepared of christ yt is wryte^. Ioa^. xiiij. And at last
Paul affirms that to be absent from the body / is to be present with god /
saying. we have co^fydence and aproue this to be beter / that is to weit / to
be absent from the body and to be present with god / which saying is spoken of
the state of soulis now being with god / absent from their bodies yet a sleep
in the earth till they be awaked and raised up at the general judgment. Sleap
is only appropriated to the bodies.
Unto this pertayneth his sayingis also unto the Philippians / affirming that
death is to himself more aduau^tage then here to live: Phi. 1.
and therefore he desired to be losed from his body that he might be with
criste his life: and this state to be miche beter then the life of this world.
Then I alleged John in the Apocalipse describi^g the states both of the
dampened and also of the blessed that dye in the lord hence forth: apo 14
which since they be blessed from their death forth / it must nedis follow that
they be in bliss in heaven. apo. 20
And John repetyng the same state describyng it almost with the same words
says those soulis were alive and reigned with crist. M. year etc. and calls
that life of the soulis / prima^ resurrectionem / the first resurrection: The
first resurrection / is the life of the soulis.
and him blessed and holy which has his part in the first resurrection: here
is it plain that this word Resurrectio is not every where taken a like as T.
says / and John describes the state of the second resurrection immediately in
the same cap. and calls the state of the dampened the second death by which
correlatiuis calling it the first resurrection in respect of the second / and
those antithesis and puttyng one contrary agenst a another every reader may
gather which is the first life / and the first death / which is the second
death and second resurrection. But these plain testimonies of the scripture
would take no place with Tindal / for he wrested and writes them contrary to
his own doctrine out of their proper and pure sense with feigned gloses to shift
and seek holes / he aftir his wont disdaynful manner agenst me fylipt them forth
between his finger and his thombe / and what disdaynfull and obprobrious wordis
he gave me for so resoning agenst him I will not now reherce / lest I should
minysshe the good opinion that some men have in him. Also there is a plain
descripcio^ of the state where unto the soulis departed in crist he ar received
Hebr. xij. ye are not come unto the hill Sinai which none might touch: but ye
are come unto the mou^te zion the cite of the living god / the heavenly
Jerusalem / and unto the innumerable company of angels unto the co^gregacio^
of our former first begote^ fathers written together in heaven / and to god the
judge of al men / and unto the spirits of the pure just and unto Jesus criste
the mediator of the new covenant eue^ unto the bespreigned blood. Here is yt
plain / that in this heavenly Jerusalem ar now the congregation of our former
fathers and the spirits of the just men / for aftir the general resurreccion
/ this congregation shall be no spiritis / but the company of very me^ having
flesh and bone / which the spiritis have not: crist sayng to his disciples
feel and touch me / for a spyrit has nether flesh nor bones. But at last I
remember that I made him this reason / saying. Sir ye know that christ is our
head / and we his members / and altogether his body / ye know also that
christ is the first frutis / and fore leader of them 1. cor. 15
that sleap / Then I argewed thus / The body must nedis follow the head / and
whother the head went thither must the body follow (for crist optayned of his
father that wheresoever he should be / there should his faithful be with him to
se his glory) but christis spirit departed slept not out of heaven / but went
into the fathers ha^dis in heaven / wherefore even so shall ours aftir our death
/ if we dye his me^bres and in the lord: ioa^. 14 and. 17
This reason did so byght Tindal / and stoke so fast upon him that he could
not shake it of / but is now at last (thanked be god) constrained to say with
me in his goodly godly pistle against me / that I think (he dare not yet
co^sta^tly affirm it) the soulis departed in the faith of crist to be in no
worse case then the soul of criste was from the time he delivered his spirit
into the ha^dis of his father until the resurreccion of his body. Tindal
Joy.
Here may every reader se / that though he thinks now other wise then he
has wryte^ in so many placis / and now thinks the very same that I ever
affirmed and objected agenste him / yet had he lever against his own
conscience thus enuyously with so many spightfull lies and sclau^ders unto my
perpetual infamy / having no respect unto the sclaunders and hurt mynistred
unto the congregation of Christ / nor yet to the gaudye and rejoice of our
adversaries / to have written agenst me then to refrayned his pe^ne and
aknowleged his error. So proud and arroga^t are they that stand so hyghly in
their own co^sayght and falfe opinion / pertinatly to defend it though they se
it right false / rather then they would seem convicted especially of any simple
and one that apereth not so well learned as they be them selves.

The Apology and answer unto Tindals pistle.
But let us now here Tindals uncharitable pistle set before his new Testament
thus tytled.

Tindal
Vylliam Tindal / yet once more to the Christen Reader.

Joy.
Tindale should have gotten him more honesty / and less shame / if he had written
once less to the reader.

Tindal
Thou shall understand (most dear reader) when I had taken in hand to look
over the new testament again / and to compare it with the greek / and to mende
what so ever I could find amysse and had almost fynesshed the labor.

It was but looked over in deed nothing performing his so large promyses added
in the later end of his first translacio^ to the reader / and I wou^der how he
could compare yt with greek since himself is not so exquysitely seen thereyn.
Joy.


George Joy secretly took in hand to correct it also / by what occasyon his
conscience knows: Tindal
and prevented me / in so much / that his correccio^ was printed in great
noumbre / yer mine began. When it was spyed and word brought me / though it
seemed to diverse other that George Joy had not used the office off an honest
man / seeing he knew that I was in correctynge it myself: nether did walk
aftir the rules of the love and softenes which Christ and his disciples teach
us / how that we should do nothing of strife to move debate / or of vain
glory / or of covetousness. Yet I took the thing in worth as I have done
diverse other in times past as one that have more experience off the nature and
disposicion off that man's complexyon / and supposed that a little spyse off
covetousness and vain glory / (two blind goydes) had been the only cause
that moved him so to do / about which things I strive with no man: and so
followed aftir and corrected forth and caused this to be printed without surmyse
or lokynge on his correctyon.

Joy.
Lo good Reder / here may thou se of what nature and complexion T. is so
suddenly fyercely and boldly to choppe in to any ma^nis conscience and so to
usurp and prevent the office of god in iugme^t which is only the enseer and
sercher of heart and mind. Nolite indicate vt no^ iudicemini.
This godly man / iugeth and notes me vayngloriouse curiouse and couetouse /
and al for correcking a false copy of the testament that they might be the
trwelyer printed again / and so not so many false bokis sold into the realm to
the hurt and deceyt of the buyers and reders of the^. I correcked but the false
copye whereby and aftir which the printer did set his book and correcked the
same himself in the press. But I shall now plainly and sengly (for the trowth
knows nofucated polesshed and painted oracion) declare unto every man /
whereof / how / and by who^ I was moved and desyered to correcke this false
copy that should else have brought forth mo the^ two thousand falser books more
then ever england had before.

First / thou shall know that Tindal about.viij. or.ix. year a goo translated
and printed the new testament in a mean great volume / but yet with out
Calendar / co^corda^ces in the margent / and table in the end. And a non aftir
the dwche men got a copye and printed it again in a small volume adding the
kale^dare in the beginning / co^corda^ces in the marge^t / and the table in
the^de. But yet / for that they had no englisshe man to correcke the setting /
they themselue having not the knowledge of our tongue / were compelled to make
many mo fautes then were in the copye / and so corrupted the book that the
simple reder might often times be tarried and steek. Aftir this they printed it
agein also without a correctour in a greater letter and volume with the figures
in thapocalipse which were therefore miche falser then their first. when these
two pryntes (there were of them both about v. thousand bokis printed) were al
soulde more then a twelve month a goo / Tind. was pricked forth to take the
testament in hand / to print it and correcke it as he professes and promyseth
to do in the later end of his first tra^slacio^. But T. prolo^ged and
differred so necessary a thing and so just desyers of many me^. In so miche
that in the mean ceason / the dewch me^ prynted it again the third time in a
small volume like their first prynt / but miche more false the^ ever it was
before. And yet was T. here called upon again / seeing there were so many false
printed bokis still putforth and bought up so fast (for now was there given
thanked be god a little space to breath and rest unto christis church aftir so
long and greuouse persecucion for reading the books) But yet before these third
time of printing the book / the printer desiered me to correcke it: And I said
It were well done (if ye printed the^ agene) to make the^ truer / and not to
deceive our nacio^ with any mo false books / nevertheless I suppose that T.
himself will put it forth more perfait and newly corrected / which if he do /
yours shall be naught set by nor never sold. This not withstanding yet they
pri^ted them and that most false and about.ij. M. bokis / and had shortly
sold the^ al. All this long while T. slept / for nothing came from him as
far as I could perceive. Then the dewche began to printe the^ the fowrth time
because they saw noma^ else going about them / and aftir they had printed the
first leif which copye a another englissh man had correcked to them / they came
to me and desiered me to correcke the^ their copy / who^ I answered as before
/ that if T. amend it with so great diligence as he promysethe / yours will be
never sold. yisse quod they / for if he prynte. ij. m. and we as many / what
is so little a nou^ber for all england? and we will sell ours beter cheap / and
therefore we doubt not of the sale: so that I perceived well and was suer / that
whether I had correcked their copye or not / they had gone forth with their
work and had given us.ij. m. mo books falselyer pri^ted the^ ever we had
before. The^ I thus co^sidred with myself: england has ynowe and to many false
testame^ts and is now likely to have many mo: ye and that whether T. correck
hes or no / yet shall these now in hand goforth vncorrecked to / except some
body correck them: And what T. does I wot not / he makes me nothing of his
counsel / I se nothing come from him all this long while. wherein with the
help that he has / that is to say one both to write yt and to correcke it
in the press / he might have done it thryse sense he was first moved to do it.
For T. I know well was not able to do yt with out siche an helper which he has
ever had hitherto. Aftir this (I say) co^sydered / the printer came to me again
and offered me.ij. stuuers and an half for the correcking of every sheet of the
copye / which folde^ co^tayneth.xvj. leaves / and for three stuuers which
is.iiij. pense halpeny starling / I promised to do it / so that in all I had for
my labor but.xiiij. shylyngis flemesshe / which labor / had not the goodness
of the deed and common profit and help to the readers compelled me more then
the money / I would not have done yt for.v. times so miche / the copy was so
corrupt and especially the table: and yet says T. I did it of covetousness: If
this be covetousness / the^ was Tindal much more couetouse / for he (as I herd
say) took.x. ponde for his correccion. I did it also / says he / of curiosite
and vaynglory / ye and that secretly: and did not put to my name / which / I
say / be two euyde^t tokens that I sought no vaynglory / for he that does a
thing secretly and puts out his name / how seeks he vaynglory? and yet is
not the man ashamed to write that vaynglory and covetousness where my two blind
goides / but I tell Tin. again / that if malice and envy (for all his holy
protestacio^s) had not been his two blind goidis / he would never have thus
falsely / uncharitably / and so spightfully belyed and sclaundred me with so
perpetual an infamy. Tin. says I walked not aftir the rules of love and
softenes / but let men read how maliciously he belyeth and sclaundereth me for
well doing: and judge what rule of love and softnes he obseruethe. It is great
shame to the teacher when his own deedis and wordis reprove and conde^pne
himself: He has great experience of my natural disposicion and complexion
says he. But I will not be his Physician and decerne his water at this time.
And as for his two disciples that gaped so long for their masters morsel that
they might have the aduau^tage of the sale of his books of which one said unto
me. It were almose he were hanged that correcketh the testament for the dewch /
and the the other harped on his masters vntwned string / saying that because I
englissh Resurrection the life aftir this / me^ gatherd that I denied the
general resurreccion: which error (by their own sayng) was gathred long
before this book was printed / unto which either of these disciples I seemed no
honest man for correcking the copye / I will not now name the^ / nor yet show
how one of the^ / never I dare say seeing. s. Jerome de optimo gn^e interp^ta^di
/ yet took upon hi^ to teache me how I should tra^slat the scriptures / where I
should give word for word / and when I should make scholias / notes / and
gloses i^ the merge^t as himself and his master doith. But in good faith as
for me I had as lief put the trwthe in the text as in the marge^t and except
the gloss expowne the text (as many of theirs do not) or where the text is
plain enough: I had as lief leave siche fryuole gloses cleue out. I would the
scripture were so puerly and plyanly translated that it neded nether note /
gloss nor scholia / so that the reder might once swim me without a cork But
these testament was printed or T. was begu^ / and that not by my preue^cio^ /
but by the printers quick expedicio^ and T. own long sleaping / for as for me
I had nothing to do with the pri^ting thereof / but correcked their copy only /
as where I found a word falsely printed / I me^ded it: and when I came to
some derke sente^cis that no reason could be gathered of the^ whether it was by
the ignorance of the first tra^slatour or of the prynter / I had the latyne
text by me and made yt plain: and where any sentence was imperfect or clean
left out I restored it agene: and gave many wordis their pure and native
significacio^ in their places which they had not before. For my conscience so
compelled me to do / and not willingly and wetingly to slip over siche fautes
into the hurt of the text or hindera^ce of the reder

But to certifye the (good indifferent reder) with what conscience and
discrecio^ Tin. wrote this vnsober pistle agenst me / thou shall here after se
/ that of some greuouse crimes he accuses and co^de^pneth me of an hearsaye or
of the informacio^ by other me^ That my curiosite should have drawn no small
nou^ber utterly to deny the Resurrection of the body / affirming that the
soul departed is the spiritual body of the resurreccion / and other
resurrection shall there none be. Tindal
Joy.
This informacio^ T. brings in / in the second leif of his pistle to
confirm the same sclaunderouse lie ymagened of his own brain / adding with a
constant affirmacio^ these wordis. Tindal
And of all this is George Joys unquiet curiosite the hole occasion. Joy.
This shameless lie and sclau^derouse affirmacio^ T. is not ashamed to prynte /
only because I say that there is a life aftir this wherein the blessed spirits
departed live in heaven with criste (for this is his wise argument / he that
puts the soulis in heaven before domes day steals away the resurrection of
their bodies / Ge. Joy says they be in heaven / ergo he denied the
resurrection) but also because he is so informed. Besydis this conde^pnacio^ of
me by hearsaye or enformacio^ of his faccyon: he is not ashamed of his own
brain to affirm and to write it / saying in the same fowrthe peise of his
pistle thus. Tindal
Moreover / ye shall understood that George Joy has had of a long time
meruelouse ymaginacio^s about these word Resurrection that it should be taken
for the state of the soulis departed etc. which same meruelouse ymaginacion /
John apo.xx. has: Joy.
calling that state or life the first resurrection: Lo. Now if T. nor yet his
wise enformers cannot prove nor iustifye these sclau^derouse lies upon me / as
I know well they never shall as every man may se me in my bokis constantly
wrytinge and affirmyng the Resurreccion of our bodies at domes day which (I
thank god) I never douted of: may ye not se then the maliciouse intent /
shrewed purpose / and corrupt conscience of this man for all his holy
protestacio^s / thus temerariously and abominably to write to defame and
sclau^der me? Are not these the venomouse tethe of vepers that thus gnawe a
another ma^nis name? ar they not spearis and dartis and their tongues as sharp
as swerdis as the prophet paynteth the^? Psalm. 57. Psalm. 140.
whette they not their tongues like serpe^ts? nourysshe they not adders venom
with their lips? yisse verily. For the trowth is not in their mouths says
David: psalm. 5
They are corrupted within / their throat is an open stynking grave / with
their tongues they flater and deceive. Here may ye smell out of what stynkyng
breast and poisoned virulent throat this peivisshe Pistle spyrethe and breathed
forth.

But yet here first of all / T. (as ye may se) accuses and da^pneth me / of
conjecture and temerariouse judgment / to be dishonest / not walking aftir
christis rules of love and softnes / but rather to be a sediciouse person
moving strife and debate / to be vayngloriouse / curiouse / and couetouse and I
cannot tell you what. But ere T. had thus by open writing and prynting it to /
accused and dampened me / yt had become him (if he had wylled to be taken for a
christian man) first to have known these vices pryuately correcked between me
and them who^ I had with these sins offended and eft aftir for my
incorrigible and intractable hardness not hearing the church / to have also
offended yt openly casting me out of yt / as crist techeth us: and not thus
fyercely and suddenly of a light and false conjecture and temerariouse judgment
(I will say no worse) to prevent both the judgment of god and man and to usurp
the office of god before he come to judge us both / nothing feryng his terrible
thretening / saing Judge noman lest ye be iuged / conde^pne not lest ye be
conde^pned your selves. mat. 7. Luc. 6.
T. co^de^neth me of curiosite / but judge / (indifferent reder) whither this be
not an unquiet vayn curyouse touch to crepe into a another ma^nis conscience
curiously to search accuse and co^de^pne / when he should have descended rather
into his own / examini^g himself of what affeccio^ and mind he would write so
many lies and sclau^ders of his brother of so light conjecture and heresayes.
If I had been gilty al these fautes / it had been Tin. part to have had
compassion rather upon me / to warn / to exhort me / then so suddenly and
spyghtfully to have had accused me so openly / and that with so perpetual and
haynouse a sclau^der of my name that himself (though he would) yet can he not
revoke it and restore it me agene. He should have co^sydered that god
commands us to be each others servants / and not so cruel iuges and
conde^pners / namely of siche light co^iectures. To. 14
what has T. to do to judge a another ma^nis servant? what folehardines is it to
crepe out of our own consciences curiously to search other mennis hertis? ye
and that to judge and co^dempne them by open and perpetual bokis? I have god my
judge / and therefore need I not Tindals temerariouse judgment: either I stand
or fall unto my nown lord / yea he is redye / if I fall / merciably to lift
me up again / and to sustayn me that I fall not. But T. and his goodly
enformers thought / it was no honest ma^nis touch to correcke a falfe copye of
the testament / which if yt had not be done at that time / there had been
printed and sold two. M. mo falser bokis then ever before: this seemed no
honest touch to them that had bought Tindals copy corrected for ten ponde as I
herd say / and should have the advantage of the first sale / for it seemed to
them / that the mo trwer testame^ts / the less to be their auau^tage: but had
these that I correcked / gone forth falser then any wother before / and had I
refused the correccio^ of them / and so all the buyers and reders to have been
utterly deceived with the^ / then had I played the honest man: then would not one
of them (as he did) have wisshed me hanged for my labor. But now to have
correct that false copy that the testame^ts might be the trwlyer prynted for
the edifying of the reders / is aftyr T. charity / a deed of strife and debate
/ and of one that walks not aftir the rules of love and softnes which Tindale
/ Christ I should say / and his disciples teach us. To correck the false
copye that the holy testament might be the perfytlyer red and vnderstonde^ /
that the reders be not tarried nor seduced is now aftir T. and his enformers a
touch of vaynglory / curiosite / and covetousness blind gydis etc. For if I
had changed never a word in the book / but only correcked (...) making
himself to be astonned and to woundre of what furye I was carried to give this
one word Resurrection his very (...) significacio^ / which I did of no fury
but of good zele unto the truth / lest the reader might be seduced with you
believing there is no life of soulis departed: but to lie a sleep without heaven
till domes day / For in so englysshyng the word I do no more abhor the name
of the resurrection then do your self in the.xj. cap. to the hebrews where
your self call yt life also: and have granted it me that yt so signifies.
If I deny the resurreccion for so englysshing it / so do you deny hell for
englisshing Infernus a grave.

Tindal
If that chance / to turn resurrection into life after this life / be a
dyligent correccio^ / then must my translacion be fautie in those places / and
saint Ieromes / and all the translatours that ever I heard of in what tongue so
ever it be / from the apostles unto this his dyligent correccion (as he calls
it) which whither it be so or no / I permit it to other men's judgments.

Joy.
whether my correccion in this place be a dilligent correccio^ / and Tin.
tra^slacion fautye or no / let better learned then we both be iuges. Nether
follows yt / that for because either mine be dilligent / or T. be fautye / saint
Ieroms (which never that I red translated it into englisshe) should be fautye
in latyne / for he translated but out of greek into latin (if he did translate
it) understanding (I dare say) by this word Resurrectio in those places the
life of soulis departed or the first resurrection as John calls yt / and not
the general resurrection as T. dremeth. apo. 2^
S. Jerome knew full well that the word in hebrew had mo significacio^s then
the resurreccion of the flesh / and did not every where translate the hebrew
verb into Surgo / as I have showed before alleged in Isaye.

But of this I challenge George Joy / that he did not put his own name thereto
and call yt rather his own traslacion: Tindal
and that he plays boo pepe / and in some of his books puts in his name
and title / and in some keeps it out.

If George Joy playth bo peep for not putting to his name / then does Tin.
play bo peep with the testament first translated where he did not put to his
name to avoid vaynglory: Joy.
And. S. Paul (by this wise reason) played bo peep with his pistle to the
hebrews. Also here T. chalengeth me be cause I called yt not rather my nowne
translacio^ / oh good lord what occasions this man honteth for agenst me?
Truth yt is that Solomon says prouer.xviij. he that delights in dissensio^ /
takes of every thing an occasyo^ to chyde. Should I have called yt my
translacio^ for correcking the fawty and corrupt copye / or for englisshing
resurreccion the very life aftir this? If I had so done verily T. had had a
just cause to have written against me for lying and stealing away the glory of
his name for first translating the testament / But it was happy that the
printer in making the title called yt a dilligent correccio^ and not a
tra^slacio^ T. here adds to my name / my title to. I cannot tell what he
means by my title: except yt be / that in some of my bokis I write that I was
some time fellow of Peter College in Camebridge for the more difference between
a another man that perchance might have the same name that I have / And if this
be the title that offends T. I will hence forth leave yt out.

It is lawful for who will / to translate and show his mind / though a
thousand had translated before him. Tindal
Joy.
why then is T. thus angry with me for shewi^g my mind (no not my mind but
the mind of crist) upon this word resurrectio? But is yt not lawful
(thinks me) ner yet expedient for the edifienge of the unity of the faith of
christ / that whosoever will / shall by his own auctoryte / take another man's
tra^slacio^ and put out and in and change at pleasure / and call it a
correccio^. Tindal
Joy.
God forbid that T. should so think of himself / that he has so exquysitly
/ (ye and that at first) translated the testament that yt cannot be me^ded /
for he aknowlegeth and proves the contrary himself / and desyerth other me^ to
me^de yt: wherefore verily me thought it both lawful and expedyent so to do:
ye and that by as good autorite as he did first translate it vnperfaytly. Is yt
not lawful to correck that at is amysse lest the readers be either tarried or
seduced? Aftir orygine / Jerome translated and often correcked the psalter and
was desyered of Damasus then bishop of Rome to correck the the new testament /
which (I am suer) thought it lawful and expedient to / as we se daily / other
learned men other wise redyng and tra^slating the scriptures then did Jerome.
Did all the old doctors translate / allege / and read the scriptures a like?
Did they sto^de so highly in their own co^saight that any one dysdayned to be
correcked of a another? And shall we then permytte unto only Tind. but a man /
far inferior unto them both in lerning / judgment / and vertew / to translate
and write what he lysteth noman so hardy to amend his fautis? what profit and
goodness comes of the diversity of tra^slacio^s / read S. Austen in his second
book de doctrina christiana cap. xij. In the chirch of god as there be many and
diverse me^bres / so have they many and sundry gifts / and one may se in a
another ma^nis workis that he saw not himself. And I doubt not but there be /
and shall come aftir us / that can and shall correcke our works and
tra^slacions in many places and make them miche more perfayt and better for the
reader to understand / and should we therefore brawll and write agenst them as
T. does agenst me? god forbyde / but rather thank them and give place as
Paul teaches.j. Corinth. xiiij.

Moreover / ye shall understood that George Joy has had of a long time
marvelouse ymaginacio^s about this word resurreccion (that it should be taken
for the state of the souls aftir their departinge from their bodies / and has
also (though he has been reasoned with thereof and desired to cease) yet sown
his doctrine by secret letters on that side the sea / and caused great division
among the brethren. Tindal
In somoch that John Fryth being in p^son in the toure of London / a little
before his death / wrote that we should warn him and desyer him to cease / and
would have then written against him / had I not withstonde him. and ceta.

If Tindals part had been so trwe / and mine so false for translatyng this
word Resurrectio / as he prete^deth: Joy.
Tindale falls from his cause / to lying and sclaunderyng.
he would have bode^ better by it / and have stoken nerer the probacio^ thereof
in his pystle as by the kaye of his whole cause proving his tra^slacion trwe
and mine false: and never have had so far swaruen from his principal / as (al
probacio^s for his part / and the co^futacio^s of mine clean forgote^) a man
carried of what furiouse affectes hes tragical pistle declares to fall to
belying / defaming and sclau^deri^g of any man: he should have erst proved his
part trw and mine false or he had thus raged and rayled upon me. But these
crimes which he here openly and falsely i^pingeth unto me of his own head and
cannot iustifye them / he has promised before record to revoke. And if he be
a trwe cryste^ man / sith he cannot iustifye his writi^g so vncircu^spectly
put forth and thrusted into many ha^dis / he must either for fere of that
terrible sentence of god thretening al evil spekers / detractours and defamers
his ve^geau^ce and wrath / orels if charity be so far quenched in his breast
as his maliciouse pistle proves it / yet at least wise for very shame of
these.iiij. honest me^ / before who^ and eft sens before me he promised to
revoke his writing of me / he must now revoke hes sclau^derouse and lying
pistle wherein he says that I abhor the name of the resurrection and that I
should deny it. Also here he imputes unto me certain crimes of which he
co^de^pneth me of here say / ye and that by the enformacio^ of other / That no
small nou^ber through my curiosite utterly deny the resurrection of the bodies
etc. lo / good reader / Thus is not T. ashamed nor afraid to write at
thenformacio^s (if there be any sich) of other me^. T. should have first
co^sidred what me^ these were that so falsely informed him / and of what stomak
and proof they informed hi^. For these dare I say co^sta^tly (I have yet the
copy of the letters written but only unto one man / in which as every man may
se / it may be as soon and as lykely gathered that I deny that there is any god
as the resurrection / but I do rather al firm yt / or that only the soul
departed is the spiritual body of the resurrection as T. is informed and here
affirms the same to confirm this false enformacio^. T. and his enformers
should have turned first to the article in our credo co^cerni^g the resurreccion
which I translated / loking whether I do not affirm it / and like wise in all
placis of scripture where so ever I find this word Resurrectio signifying the
resurrection of our bodies.) But I dare say: that if Tindals erformers who^
by name I could draw out into light (if Tin. say it not of his own head)
were examined of this report / that as they cannot for shame affirm and show
it to be taken of my letters / so should T. with miche more shame to have been
afraid openly to write it / adding this adsercion of his own brain.

Tindal
And of all this is G. Joys unquiet curiosite the hole occasion / whether he
be of the said faccion also / or not / to that let him answer him self.

Joy.
All this foresaid peise therefore is nothing else (I take god to record) but a
continual shameless lie and a perpetual spightful sclau^der maliciously
blown together upon me out of Tin. mouth. These salfe lies and enuyouse
infamyes whether they can come forth of any criste^ breast or stand with siche
holy adiuracio^s and protestacio^s as he paynteth aftirward to color his
ypocrysy and deadly hatered so long conceived / noureshed in his breast and now
spitted out upon me let every man judge / For as for me / god knowth / I never
had other ymaginacion about this word resurreccion then the significacio^
which I have sufficiently declared. And if ever I had any wother ymaginacio^s
then that which in some placis (as I have translated it) it signifies / even
the ferme fast permane^t life of the soulis departed: and agene in some placis
the resurreccion of the flesh as I have declared yt / I adpele / provoke /
and compel Tindals conscience to tell yt openly / and if he cannot / let him
confess his lie and knowleg how shamelessly he sclau^dereth me and revoke it.
Also where he says / that I have been reasoned with all and desyered to cease:
it is true that I reasoned with him of this matter twice or thryse and told him
that he did well if he revoked his erroneouse doctrine sown so often in his
bokis: and if he says that it was he that desyered me to cease / I reasoned
with none else but only with him / in good faith I shall tell the trwthe / we
never reasoned the matter but through his impacie^ce our disputacio^ ever ended
with chyding and brawling in somiche that aftirwarde in his exposicion upon
John he stretched forth his pen agenst me as far as he dirst / but yet
spared my name / at the which chale^g I winked / yet taking yt not as meant of
me because I loved quyetnes not wylling that any man should know what hatred he
did ever bear me sense I came over / For when he could not avoid the manifest
scriptures nor soil the reasons brought agenst him / then the man began to
fume and chaafe calling me fool / unlearned / with other obprobriouse names:
then I knew not the scriptures nor what I said etc. and except T. call this his
charitable desyer and loving monicio^ wherewith he desyerd me to cease / in
good faith I never herd whother of his mouth. I am sorry to write this / but
his deadly lies and maliciously sclaunders compel me to do yt. Tindal
Then says he that I have sown my doctrine by secret letters on that side
the sea and caused great division emonge the brethren etc. I never wrote
letter concerning this matter I take god to record but unto one man seduced
Joy.
by his false doctrine / which yet (I think) persysteth for all my letters in
the same opinion / so wholly depends he upon Tindals mouth addicte unto his
wordis / that the soulis sleap out of heaven till domes day / who^ I warned at
last to cease writing any more of this matter to me / and not to stand over
miche in his own co^sayght nor yet to depe^de over myche of any ma^nis doctrine
/ declaring hi^fyrst the significacio^s of this word resurrectio as I have
done in this Apologye / And yet have I here the copye of my letters sent unto
this man which I never desyered as every man shall se to be kept secret /
nether did the young man so keep them for they and their copyes went through
many handis as I understood aftir / and were sent unto Frithe in the tower /
whereof Frith wrote this warnyng to Tin. which he here mencyoneth / and I
answered Frith agene by my letters / but aftir I answered him / I never herd
more from Frith of this matter / and yet had he a long time aftir in the tower
to have wryte^ / if he had seen his part good: Frith wrote tindals answers to
More for tindale / and corrected them in the prynte / and printed them to at
Amelsterdam / and whether he winked at T. opinion as one having experience of
Tindals complexion / or was of the same opinion I cannot tell / the man was
ientle and quiet and wellerned and better should have been if he had lived. Then
says T. Thereto I have been sense informed that no small nowmber through his
curiosite deny the resurrection of the flessh and body. Tindal
Thou seist (good reader) how that I deny not the general resurrection / nor I
my self never thought it to be denied but have consta^tly affirmed and taught
it. Joy.
But thou reme^brest euerywhere T. argument / thus argwing full falsely: If the
soulis be in heaven / ergo there shall be no resurrection of their bodies. Here
tindals faccion and his disciples argew and believe like their Master / sayng:
lo George Joy says the soulis be in heaven / wherefore it must nedis follow
that he denies the resurreccion of their bodies / orels he must make our
Master and father tindale a liar and his doctrine false / here may every man se
how T. playth bo peep with me impynging heresy unto me / for co^futi^g his
error sown hitherto in his bokis: Tindal
yet says T. to / that these men seduced by my doctrine affirm that the soul
/ when she is departed / is the spiritual body of the resurrection: and other
resurrection shall there non be. If T. can show me these words to be mine
either in writing / or bring forth any man that ever herd me speak them /
then let me suffer death. Joy.
For I take god to record that I never thought them / and sense I red my
philosophy / I knew the difference between a body and the soul / and was
never so mad as to call the soul a spiritual body / as Tindal says I do
affirm yt: but T. in deed when I argewed that sleep in scripture was only
appropryated unto the body and not to the soul / and a shuttyng up of the
sencis from their use / he granted me that the soul of man was also a bodily
substance: whereat a non I perceived his high lerning. Tindal
At last says T. I have talked with some of them my self so doted in that
folly that it were as good to persuade a post as to pluck that madness out of
their brains. And of this all is George Joys unquiet curiosite the hole
occasion. Joy.
If any man list to believe T / that he has thus talked with some so doted /
let hi^ so do in gods mane. For as for me / sith I se hi^lye so manifestly in
other thingis / suerly I trust hi^ the less in this tale: nor will I never
believe him til he brings forth some one so doted / For I think there be
none so mad / And whether I be so curiouse and unquiet as he reports me /
let them be iuges that se my workis and read this mine answer and know my
co^uersacion. And here T. adds this tail to knyt up his lies sayng / whether
he be of the said faccion also or not / to that let hi^ answer himself. Tindal
Joy.
I am not afraid to answer Master Tindal in this matter for all his high
lernyng in his hebrewe greek latyne etc. T. supposes / ye he affirms yt here
twice for failing / that I am of the same faccio^ And I answer and tell T.
agene that he belyeth me deadly / and that nether he nor noman else can gather
one jot of all the writing and words that ever I spoke or wrote / that I
should once think that there should be no general resurrection of our bodies /
nor yet that the souls departed should only be the spiritual bodies of the
resurrection. Blame me not (I beseech the criste^ reader) though I seem in this
place vnpacie^t: For verily I am spightfully provoked and exasperated with his
lies and sclau^ders thus pe^ned into my perpetual infamy / and am compelled to
defend my name and fame which there is nothing to me more dear and leife / for
there is no kind of infamy so pernicius as is to be sclau^dered of heresye /
which Tin. impingeth unto me / nothing co^sydering that (though he would) yet
can he not restore me my name agene / And I meruel that this so holy a man as
he prete^deth himself forgets what paul threteneth sayng that these evil
spekers bye / and sclau^derers shalnot possede the heretage and kingdom of
god. i. cor. v
I pray god give these man a better mind and to pri^te well in his heart and
remember his own doctrine / and to fear his own terrible oath and so hard and
perellouse desyer in this his pistle: thus saying here aftir. Tindal
More over I take god (which alone seith the heart) to record to my conscience
/ beseching him that my part be not in the blood of crist / if I wrote of all
that I have written through out all my book / aught of an evil purpose / of envy
or malice to any man etc.

Tindal
If George Joy will say (as I wot well he will) that his change is the the
sense (...) put in of a another man: nether do I here at my nowne pleasure put
in my meaning but the meani^g of crist as himself expowneth it / whose meani^g
is not the next way to stablysshe heresies as Tindals meaning does / as I
have plainly proved / which let me se if he can improve and confute: but
rather to confute T. heresye which is that the soulis sleap out of heaven feling
nether pain nor joy til domes day.

(...) for an ensample / when Christ says Io. v. Tindal
(...) teth this word Deus / calling yt god in english / thrusts not out
god / but puts hi^ in for them to know him in englisshe which understand
not the latin. If Tin. translate these wordis / paradisu^ voluptatis / calli^g
them a garden in Ede^ / and a another come aftir hi^ englisshyng the same a
pleasant paradise / this man thrusts not clean out paradise. Nether where he
tra^slateth And Jacob blessed Pharao / and a another tra^slateth the same sayng
/ And Jacob thanked Pharao / yt folowthe not that therefore this man thrusts
out clean this word Benedixit / no more then he thrusts out Paulis soul /
that tra^slateth this place of paul. Gen^ xlvij
These. ij.
we desyerd not only to give unto you the gospel of god but also our own
lives or our own selves / for which Tin. says our own soulis.

Tindal
Now by the same auctorite / and with as good reason shall another come and
say of the rest of the text / they that are in the sepulchers / shall hear his
voice / that the sense is / the souls of them that are in the sepulchers shall
hear his voice / and so put in his dyligent correccion and mock out the text
/ that it shall not make for the resurreccion of the flesh / which thing also
George Joys correccion does manifestlye affirm.

I would know of Tinda. Joy.
whether when a mannis body is dead and laid in grave / yt be his dead body
or his soul that hereth cristis voice / I am suer T. is not so far besydis
his common sencis as to say the dead body hereth cristis voice / ergo yt is
the soul that hereth yt / and then why does T. despise my sense or rather the
trw sense of the scripture calling it a mocking out of the text and a false
gloss? I am suer Tin. will not understand the textes of Peter / that the
gospel is preched to the dead bodies in grave but rather to the soulis
departed / Albeit I se in his new correccion how shamefully and of what corrupt
mind god knowth / he has perverted this text / with this note / That the
dead ar the ignorant of god. i. pet. 3 and. 4
i. pe. 4.
when there the dead and quyke be taken as they sto^de in the credo / the dead
even for the departed out of this world and the quyk for them that live there
in: which article that criste shall judge them both / as it is setforth for the
plain people so is it plainly spoken as the letter sowneth / and not in a mistik
allegory worthy any sich a false gloss i^ the merge^t / T. should have looked
beter on the circumstance of the text / and not have englisshed / vt
iudicarent quide^ scdm hoi^es carne: that they should be condemned of me^ in
the flesh. For by this peruertyng of the text me^ may se that T. has
forgoten his gra^mer / or else god knowth of what mind he would have here /
mortuis / not to signifye the departed out of this world / and iudicare^tur
signifye that they should be conde^pned / and scdm hoi^es / of me^. which
sentence he translated at first truly / and now corrected it de meliore in
peius: as every learned / ye and unlearned may se / T. says I take away the
text from him in this one word resurrectio: but he in this place / I dare
say / and can prove it to his face / that he corrupts the text / and by his
false translating it / takes away the trwe vndersto^ding thereof from as many
as read yt / and believe his translacio^. Nether does he that says the soulis
of the dead shall here cristis voice / deny the resurreccion of the flesh:
for they may / and do both stand well together. Criste had al power given
him in heaven and earth aftir his death and resurrection / and that eue^ the
power to preserve the dead alive in their souls which power of god he told
the Saduceis they knew not / and yet by his godhed he did daily execute yt: he
had power also to judge / although he be the son of man / which power then
given him is not idle and void til domes day / but is daily executed in the
particlare judgment of every soul departed (if T. grants any particlare
judgment at al but will say the soulis sleep) and then is not this the trwe
sense of John in this place? that the soulis of the bodies resting and sleaping
in grave shall here cristis voice and come forth into that very life which
they now live and crist proved it unto the Saduces? John (I say) being so
plentuouse in telling one thing so often and so many ways / said the same thing
twice be fore / once thus: verily verily I say unto you / whosoever here my word
/ and believe him that sent me / has life everlasting and shalnot come into
conde^pnacio^ / but is passed over from death to life / And aftir ward he
expressith yt plainly to be verifyed even of the dead / the time of his
judgment in his manhed then standing upon or being present / saying verily
verily I say unto you / The time shall come / and eue^ now yt is: Joan 5
when eue^ the dead shall here the voice of the sone of god / and who so here yt
shall live: which power of the sone / to be received of the father / and in that
to be egal with him declared / he resumeth the same sentence yet again the
third time / sayng. Meruel not at this thing / for the time shall come in
which all that ar in graves shall here his voice and they that have done good
shall come forth into that very life / and they that have done ill into that
miserable or da^pnable life. For where he said before / the dead shall here his
voice / now he says for the same / all that are in graves shall here his voice
/ and where he said in the first same sentence / ar passed from death to life
and have everlasting life / in the second sentence he says / shall live / and
in the third and last of all he says / shall come forth in to that very and
perfect life / and where he said before / condempnacio^ / here at last he
calls the same the life of conde^pnacion or dampnable life / as yt is the
common phrase of scripture to say spiritus sanctificationis / pro spiritu
sancto and sanctitas veritatis pro vera sanctitate with many siche like / Also
yt is to be noted that there is none of theuangelistis nor apostles so
plentuouse in expowning himself with so many wordis and so often repeting one
thing as is John / vsyng this particle (Et) in englyssh as myche to say as
(And) expositiue: that is to expowne the sentence or word before / as when he
says who so come to me shall not hongre / and whosoever believe in me shall never
thirst / there this particle (and) expowneth what yt is to come to Crist / that
is to say to believe in Criste / And when he says: Io. vi.
Io. xj.
I am the resurreccion and life / there this word (and) expowneth what
resurreccion sygnifyeth / even very life / and so the sentence following
declares yt. Io. iij.
And again where he says except a man be borne of water and the spirit etc
there / this word (And) signifies / that is to say of the spirit / expowning
what water is in that place as Isay expowneth water / and John also. Esaye.
xliiij
Io. vij.
But and if T. will nedis say still that I mock out the Resurrection of the
flesh / because I say that the soulis of the^ that be in graves shall here his
voice / I answer and ask him what mok is therein these my words to say that
aftir the general resurrection / the soulis with the bodes that were in grave
shall come forth into that life everlasting? Is not this a true and catholyk
sense? can T. make it false? But yet here would I ask T. (if he would not judge
me curiouse) a another question / even this: whether that the bodies shall rise
before they comeforthe of their graves / and so comeforthe into that perpetual
life / or whether they shall first comeforthe of their graves and then rise
aftirwarde? If he says they must rise before they comeforthe unto that very
life / then is yt trwe that they shall not come forth unto the resurrection /
for they be now risen al redye and the resurreccion is past with them / and
then is my translacio^ trwe that they shall come forth into that very life /
and not unto the resurrection of their bodies as T. says. And if he will say
/ to make this word resurreccion to signify the resurrection of the flesh
(lest it be mocked out as he says / which noma^ entendeth) that the bodies
first come forth of their graves and then rise aftirwarde / then is his
translacion as true and as like / As the man that lies him down to sleep upon
his bed in his chamber first to come forth of his chamber before he ryseth out
of his bed / lo (reader) here thou seist whother Tin. is brought for so
supersticyously steking to only one significacion of this word Resurrectio.
Now let T. beware lest among so many his friuole notis and gloses in mergents
some of them befownde both false and sclau^derouse and to little effect. For as
for my englisshi^g of the word / is proved manifestly to be the very text. And
at last where T. says / that in his mind a little unfeigned love aftir the
rules of criste etc. Joy
I think that siche love may not stand with cristis rules / orels Tindals
love is miche worth which has feigned vtwardly to have loved me / when all
this while he did but nouresshe in his breast hatered and malice long a go
conceived and now at last has spewed forth al his venom and poison at once
upon me.

Tindal
Wherefore / concerning the resurreccion / I protest before god and our
savior Jesus Crist / and before the universal congregation that believes in
him / that I believe according to the open and manifest scriptures and
catholyck faith / that Christ is risen again in the flesh which he received
of his mother the blessed virgin marie / and body wherein he dyed. And that we
shall all both good and bad rise both flesh and body / and apere together
before the judgment seat of crist / to receive every man according to his
deeds. And that the bodies of all that believe and continue in the true faith of
christ / shall be endewed with like immortalite and glory as is the body of
christ.

Tin. needs not to make so long an holy protestacion of this matter / for
noman layth yt to his clarge: Joy.
but let Tin. clear himself of this error that he has written thryse in his
answer to M. More and in his exposicion of John: That is to weit that he
says the soulis departed sleep and shall not be in heaven till domes day /
and yet affirms arrogantly and argeweth unwisely / that whosoever should say the
contrary / denies the general resurreccion.

And I protest before god and our savior christ and all that believe in him /
that I hold of the souls that are departed as much as may be proved by
manifest and open scripture / and think the souls departed in the faith of
christ and love of the law of god / to be in no worse case then the soul of
Christ was / from the time that he delivered his spryte into the hands of his
father / until the resurreccion of his body in glory and immortalite. Tindal
Neuerthelater / I confess openly / that I am not persuaded that they be all
ready in the full glory that crist is in / or the elect angels of God are in.
Nether is yt any article of my faith: for if yt so were / I se not but then
the preaching of the resurreccion of the flesh were a thing in vain. Not
withstondinge yet I am ready to believe it / if it may be proved with open
scripture.

Joy.
Now thanked be god / that Tin. at last has fownde out that doctrine which
crist nor his apostles never taught / nor was not in the world at that time.
God be preased that have showed T. that deep secret laid up in his tresury /
Now he thinks that the soulis departed be in no worse case then was cristis
spirit from his death until his resurreccion / but cristis spirit was in heaven:
ergo T. steals away the resurrection of cristis body and our bodies to /
But Tin. thus come home / now shifteth and seeks this sterting hole sayng that
if they be in heaven in as full and perfect glory as crist is in / or the elect
angels (and yet of this full and perfect glory noma^ conte^deth with him) then
he seith not else but that the prechi^g of the resurrection were in vain. Tindal
No forsothe: Joy.
The resurrection is so necessary an article of our faith that in what Joy
soever the souls be / yet we must believe yt and preche it to / orels make
cristis doctrine false and say that himself is not risen. And here can I not
meruel enough at T. ignorance of the scriptures / which declare plainly that
the glory and joy of the soulis is more full and perfect when they shall have
their bodies felows and part takers of their felicite and joy who^ they had
once as ministers of their good workis and partakers of their affliccio^s /
then when they have their glory alone with out their bodies. For unto this
fulness and gloriouse perfeccio^ Paul looked with sore sighs to come when the
hole entire body of crist and full nowmbir of his elect shall come in
altogether aftir the resurrection of their bodies / sayng That all creatures
long for the delyuera^ce out of their seruitute into that gloriouse liberty
of the childeren of god: romans 8.
and we our self long sore and abide for that adopcio^ eue^ the rede^pcion of
our bodies. luce. 21
For then the soulis shall resume their own bodies not mortal but immortal /
incorruptible / spiritual / and gloriouse for i. cor. 15
ever. And if this werre not a more full and perfyter state then the glory that
yet is but of the soulis alone / yt should not be so sore sighed and longed
fore of paul and every faythefull that thus believes of the redemption /
adopcion / and liberty of their bodies which yet either sleep in the duste or
live in trouble affliccion / corrupcion / mortalite / ignomynie etc. Act. iij
Also in the actis / Luke remembers this perfeccion and full state calling yt
the time of refrigery and confort of the presence of god and time of the
restoring of all thyngis. And Paul expressing this gloriouse perfeccion and
perfect glory of both bodies and soulis together aftir the general
resurreccion / says. ^e. xi.
All these through faith deseruyng this testimony have not yet received the
promise (that is to say the entire renewing / rede^pcio^ / and resurrection of
their bodies promised them) because that god had provided these one beter thing
for us / that is to wete / that they without us should not be made full and
perfect or be set fast in their full glory of both body and soul. For then
shall the universal and entire corpse of criste his hole church be made full and
perfect in her most gloriouse and perfect state and perpetual fruicio^ joined in
joy everlasting unto her head Jesus criste. But Tin. says he is not persuaded
that they be all redye in the full glory that crist is in / as though this
were not plain in the scriptures / that crist is there both body and soul /
and so be not yet the elect: But yet when the elect shall be there with their
bodies / they shall not have so full and perfayth glory as criste has. epphe. ^


And I have desired George Joy to take open textes that seem to make for that
purpose / as this is. Tindal
To day thou shall be with me in paradise / to make thereof what he could /
and to let his dreams about this word resurreccion goo. For I receive not in
the scripture the private interpretacio^ of any man's brain / without open
testimony of any scriptures agreinge thereto.

T. never desyered me except his ob probrious wordis and reuyling of me were
his desyere / And in dead I brought the same text against him / and he made
aglose of paradise and said yt was not there taken for Joy.
heaven / where every man may se yt taken for heaven: for crist said thou shall
be with me / which was in heaven. Nether is the interpretacion of that word
resurreccion my private interpretacio^ / but cristis own interpretacion as I
have proved yt.

Tindal
Moreover I take god (which alone sees the heart) to record to my conscience /
besechinge him that my part be not in the blood of crist / if I wrote of all that I have written through out all my book / ought of an evil purpose / of
envy or malice to any man / or to stere up any false doctrine or opinion in
the church of crist etc.

Joy.
Here is an holy oath broken / and a perellouse desyer / if the contrary be
true / For here he rayleth upon me / he belyeth me / he sclaundereth me and
that most spightfully with a perpetual infamye: which al if yt be not of envy
/ malice / and hatered of what else should yt spring? And even here for all his
holy protestacio^s / yet herd I never sobre and wise man so praise his own
workis as I herd him praise his exposicio^ of the v.vj. and.vij. ca. Mat. in
so myche that mine ears glowed for shame to here him / and yet was it Luther
that made it / T. only but tra^slating and powldering yt here and there with
his own fantasies. which praise methought yt then better to have been herd of a
another ma^nis mouth / for it declared out of what affeccio^ yt sprang eue^
far vnlyk and contrary unto these which he now professes and protests so
holely for wordis be the messageris of mennis myndis.

Tinda^
Save only of pity and compassion I had and yet have on the blindness of my
brethren / and to bring them unto the knowledge of christ / and to make every
one of them / if yt were possible as perfect as an angel of heaven.

Joy.
Lo here may ye se the good purpose and godly intent of this good man / and yet
has he by this his uncharitable / sediciouse / sclaunderouse and lying pistle
offended and hurt many a good simple man / and caused them to cast their bokis
clean away never to look on them more / nor to believe us what so ever we have
or shall write / thus has he destroyed that which god has through us hitherto
bylded / and caused us both / ye and the gospel to / to be evil spoken of:
besyds the great rejoice and gaudye mynystred to the enymes of the trowth / ye
and some good men wysshe us both never to have been borne / and say we be
both full of poison. For doutelis Tindals complexion is siche / that for all
his holy protestacions and holyer feigned good entents here expressed of his
own mouth / yet had he lever mar and destroy al / and (as they say) set all
at six and seven / then he would have suffered the translacio^ of this one word
resurrectio to have tarried and aboden the judgment of cristis church: so sore
yt gnaweth his heart to be correcked and warned of me / but a fool and unlearned
as he both reputeth me and tells yt me to my face / For in good faith / and
as I shall answer before god / ere he came to one place of the testament to be
last corrected / I told his scrybe / even him that wrote and correckted the
testament for him / that there was a place in the beginning of the.vj. cap. of
the actis somewhat derkely translated at first / and that I had mended it in my
correction and bode him show yt Tin. to mende yt also / if yt be so seen unto
him / and I dare say he showed yt hi^ / but yet because I fownde the fawte and
had corrected yt before / Tin. had lever to have let yt (as he did for all my
warnyng) stand still derkely in his new correccion where of the reder might
take a wrong sense / then to have mended yt which place whether yt stands
now clerer and trwer in my correccion then in his / let the learned judge. The
place is this / In those days as the nowmber etc. where / for that at he
tra^slateth wydows: I say / their pore nedye / which includes both men and
weme^ / for both were releifed by their daily almose and the greek word is
the common ge^der to both / and where Tin. says / daily minystracion / I say
daily almose as Paul uses the same word.ij. corin. ix. For aftir Tindalis
translacion / yt sowneth that the apostles should have had certain wedews of
the hebrews to serve and mynyster unto them at their tables or in other uses /
and so the grudge to have risen / that these wydews were despised and put out
of office when the text trwly and clearly translated shows a another sense
far unlike yt as the circumstance declares. And if I had been giltye al these
crimes which T. falsely imputes unto me calling me vayngloriouse / couetouse /
curiouse / sedyciouse / factiouse a sower of heresies / a denyer of the general
resurrection which I take god to record I never thought nor did yt / he would
rather (if he had had siche a godly zele as he here cloketh) ere he had thus
openly and perpetually belyed and sclau^dered me / first have come to me and
warned me brotherly and patiently / But god almighty thenseer and sercher of
heart and reins how holy so ever owr vysard words and workis apere / be judge
at our departing between T. and me. I showed and now I show T. agene where the
scripture disalow his false opinion of the soulis to sleep / and ye se how he
bears yt / I showed T. where I fownde fawtis long before this in his
translacio^ and now ye se that he do not only not me^de yt nor confess not
his ignorance but rather call me heretyke and belie me thus spightfully for my
labor.

wherefore I beseech George Joy / ye and all other to / for to translate the
scripture for them selves / whether out of Greek / Latin or Hebrew. Tindal


Here T. is afraid lest any man would steal away from him the glory and
name of his translacio^: Joy.
which nether I / nor noma^ else is about to do / he would have me^ translate
for themself / when we be all borne to profit our neybours and for the common
well / by his foxisshe ensample he pretends as though I should steal away
his gloriouse name for the translacion / and yet he seith and repeteth my
wordis himself calling yt but a dylige^t correccio^ and no translacion / for yt
had been but a lie to call yt my translacio^ for tra^slatyng and mending a few
certain doutful and derke places. But I doubt not / but that aftir T. and me
both / there be or shall come / which shall me^de both our tra^slacio^s and
paradue^ture call them theirs / which I pray god send us / and I / for my part
shall give place unto siche one with great and many tha^kis.

Tindal
For this I protest / that I provoke not Joy ner any other man (but am
provoked / and that after the spytfullest manner of prouokinge) to do sore
against my will and with sorrow of heart that I now do.

Joy.
If this be not a spightful prouokacion to me / thus to belie me / to sclaunder
me as Tin. has done / let all that read both our talis be judge / and whether
the englisshing of that word resurrectio be so spightful a prouocacio^ to a
meke modest christian man / as thus so spightfully and sclaunderously to write
agenst me. Tindal
T. says I never can nor will suffer of any man that he shall go take my
translacion and correcke yt with out name. Joy.
Lo here is a great matter wherefore this so pacient a man should be offended and
moved thus shamelesly to write into the offense and hurt / ye into the
destruccio^ of all that is builded in cristis church / and perpetual infamy of
his brother / let every man beware how he meddle with T. workis / and
especially take heed that he me^de not / nor yet correck them / except he put
to his name / For how false so ever they be / Tin. wilnot gladly have them
mended as I perceive / thinkyng that noma^ is able to correcke him / and yet
under the cloak of hipocrysye himself desyereth in the end of his first
translacion other men to mende and correcke yt / this man belyke when he
translated yt / was nether man nor angel but god himself that cannot err nor
lie / he says I have made siche cha^ging as him self dirst not do as he
hops to have his part in criste though the hole world should be given him
for his labor. Tindal


And I say / I have made many changes which if T. had had siche sight in the
greek as he prete^deth and conferred yt diligently with the greek as he says
he did / he should have made the same changes him self / which places I shall
point him to here after / but yet let Tindale look over his Testament once
agene and confer yt a little beter with the verite and greek to / Joy.
I would every man would compare my correccio^ with his / and mark well every
change / and he shall se that I changed some wordis and sente^cis / which T.
aftir me was compelled eue^ as I did / so to change and correcke them himself.

Aftir that Tindals correccio^ was printed: yt chanced me to turn here and
there in his new diligently corrected testament so compared with the greek: as
first in the beginning of.j. ca. To. And there me thought his translacion was
not according to the text / where Paul in his salutacion apereth to affirm
that by three thyngis especially / as the scripture shewth yt / Criste was
declared to be the son of god. First by power / secondarely by the holy ghost
/ thirdely in that he rose from death. where the text has / ex eo quod
resurrexit etc. which T. englissheth sense the time that he rose / knowing not
what / Ex eo / there sygnifyeth / For criste was declared to be the son of
god both by his godly power and also by the holy ghost often times before his
resurrection and not after yt / as ye may se his power in doing miracles all
before his resurrection / the holigost also before yt declaring him /
John.j.xv. and.xvj. Also in the.xiiij. ca. j. cor. how englissheth he there
this word / spiritus? which signifies in that place the breathe / and voice
of our tongue / and yet T. says. If I pray with tongues my spirit prayth / but
my mind is with out fruit / which sentence aftir his translacio^ is contrary
to cristis sayng that would have us to pray and worship his father in spirit.
Ioa^. iiij. to. j. In that chap. also what englissh gives Tin. these words
propheta and prophecy? which signify there / the interpretour and
interpretacio^ or prechyng of holy scriptures. And where Paul would that these
interpretours or prechers should preche and declare the scriptures one aftir a
another before the co^gregacio^ / and not two or three of them all at once to
avoyde confusion / For god (says he) is not the author of confusion etc. T.
even clean contrary to the text / translateth thus: let the prophetis speak two
at once or three at once. There were some heretyks in paulis time which said
that our bodies shude not rise the self same ageyn / but wother disticte and
several bodies: unto whose opinion (albe it I know well T. believes yt not) yet
he ministers a shrewd occasion in taking away the text by vntrwly
tra^slating this sentence. 1. co. 15
et vnicuique seminu^ dat deus suu^ or propriu^ corpus / (as has the vulgar
text) God gives to every sead his own body / and not a several body as T.
translateth yt / For by this text Paul confuteth their heresye / that say we
shall not rise agene with our own bodies / but with some wother several and
distinct bodies from these which we now carye about. I meruel that T. calls
suu^ or proprium corpus / a several body / If I had thus translated these
places he might well have said / I had need go learn my donate and accidence
agene / rather then to translate scriptures: had he not yet have said worse by
me. But here paradue^ture Tin. will excuse hi^ by the greek or by some hebrew
phrase left theryn / as he tells some simple reders that know nether of them
both how they make agenst me in this word resurrectio: and as he bosteth
himself in the beginning of this his godly pistle and also in his prologe /
saying that he has compared the testament with the greek and weded out of yt
many fautis (and yet in some place made yt worse then it was before) which lake
of help at the beginning and over sight did sow therein. Tindal
If ought seem changed (says he) or not all together agreing with the greek /
let the finder of the fawte / consider the hebrew phrase or manner of speech
left in the greek wordis etc. Joy.
So that T. in his translacio^ / if any fawt be fownde / would seem to flitte
from Greek to hebrew / from the present te^ce to the future / from person to
person / from nowmber to number / yea and as yt plainly apereth in alteri^g
the text of Peter / and in altering these said places from the latin text /
eue^ clean from the trwthe of the text unto his own vain imaginacio^s / as
every reder may well perceive. i. pe. 4.
If he were so well seen in the greek as he makes him self / doing siche
diligence in this his correccio^ as he prete^deth and professes / he should
have left out some of so many vain and fryuole notis in the mergent nothing
correspo^di^g nor expowni^g the text / and have me^ded mo fawtes in his text
/ At the first opening of his book / I chanced upon this gloss in the
merge^t. i. joan. 3
Love is the first p^cept and cause of all other. And I looked on the the other
side / and there I saw against yt this other: Faith is the first co^mandme^t
and love the second / which gloses (except T. give us the third gloss to
declare and co^ciliate these two) may apere contrary to the reders: how be it
methi^keth yt not good so derkely and doutefully to gloss where the text is
plain / that we must go make gloss upon gloss / and so at last led me^ from
the text to wander in gloses as it has been in times paste: and paradue^ture
Tin. would have given us the third gloss to / had the merge^t have been able to
receive yt for other gloses / gloses / and al little to the purpose. Mat. 1
I meruel that aftir T. in his first tra^slacio^ our lady was married unto
Joseph / and that now in his new correccion she is but betrouthed to hi^. If
his first tra^slacion were trwe in this place / why then did he correck it? And
if it were false that she was married to Joseph when she was there espied great
with child / how shall we prove that crist was conceived in wedlok: which
thing Matthews mind is there to prove yt / and luke affirms the same / the
word translated into this latyne word desponsata / which word aftir my pore
lerning / by the reason of the preposicio^ / De / in co^posicio^ signifies more
then the simple word sponsata / and makes the verb to bear with yt more
encrese and fulness. luc. 1
Also this sentence in latyne following / priusquam congressi fuissent / Tin.
englesshith / before they came to dwell together: in which whether he has
translated trwly the mind of theua^gelist let the learned in cristis church be
iuges. I would have thus translated it. when Mary / his mother was married unto
Joseph / before they had layne together / she was espied to be with child:
which was by the holy ghost. For she was saluted in wedlok and conceived criste
by the holy ghost / before she knew (that is) slept with her howsbonde / as the
order of the text and story told / declares. when T. has mended these fautes
/ I shall show hi^ moo. And for all his great diligence in adding the pistles of
the old Testament / yet has he missed the kushen in many placis / and must be
compelled to me^de his fawtis aftir mine ensample / orels leave the reder as yt
were in his Maze sekyng for some of the pistles where he shall never find them.
^. cor. 14.
Paulis mind is that.ij. or.iij. one aftir a another (though T. translateth
two at once or three at once contrary to the text) may interp^te scriptures in
the church / wother me^ iuging and tryinge their interpretacio^s by the
scriptures. And if aught be reveled and given to any other that sits bye and
hereth the first / the first man should hold his peace and here hi^ / and not
eue^ anon to write any maliciouse and contenciouse pistle against hi^ / as does
T. against me. Paul co^ma^deth us to do al thi^gis for the edifying and
consolacio^ of the church / and not to destroy / auerte / co^fou^de / and
inquyet yt as has T. done by his sclau^derouse and sediciouse pistle. The
mind and sense of one interpretour / says paul / is subject unto a another
interpretour / hi^ to expe^de and judge yt by scriptures faithfully and lovingly
/ and shall not T. interpretacio^ be then subject and iuged by wother me^? will
he not suffer a another man to correcke and me^de his fawtis? but anon must
break forth into raging and lying / writing so sclau^derouse and shameless a
pistle upon his brother that so well deserves upon his work? And if he be so
blindely affeccionated as every man is / with out the more grace unto his own
werkis and sentence: yet ought he not to aue^ge himself on this manner / so
suddenly and headely casting sich confusion into among the co^gregacio^ / For
god is not the author of confusion but of peace etc. And eue^ here / by this
same troublouse touch of T. may every indifferent reder se which of us stood
on the trwe part / whether yt was I / in tra^slating that word other wise
then he did / or whether yt was he aftir ward eue^ co^tine^tly in writing so
sclau^derouse and venomouse a pistle declaring unto all indifferent godly and
not affeccionated reders of what spirit the man was carried. But god give hi^ a
better mind / and us both grace to forgive each other / to repress al siche
carnal affectes that we may be both reviued and renewed with the spirit of
peace and love / that our spirits departed from our bodes might live with
crist in heaven until our bodies aftir that sleep in the duste be awakened with
the tro^pet of god / and resumed of our soulis to rise and comeforthe together
into that gloriouse life and ioyouse glory / perpetually to praise and
magnifye our father by his son our savior in the holy ghost / unto whom be
glory and praise for ever Amen.

Tindale verily might never abide yt / that I especially (whether he so
thinks of wother me^ god knows) should translate / write / or meddle with the
scriptures / as though the holy ghost with his giftis were restrained unto
only Tin. and might not breath where hi^ lists / as though T. were learned
only / and none but he. wherefore let every reder be warned and taught at this
ensample and greuouse tentacion of this man (for I take yt no another wise) lest
as Paul says / we be puffed up with coninge void al charity which edifieth. Let
us not sto^de to highly in our own opinion / lest while we apere learned / we
prove our self foles / and while we seem to sto^d fast / we lie groueling on
the grownde gnawing the earth / eting and deuowering our criste^ brothers name
and fame / besmeri^g and dawbing each other with dirte and myer. psalm. 55
But had it been my enimye that thus had unjustly reuyled and vexed me / I
could have borne him / And if my hater had thus oppressed me / I could have
had avoided him. But yt was thou my nowne fellow / my companion in like perel
and persecucion / my familiare / so well known / unto who^ I committed so
lovingly my secretis / with who^ gladly I went into the house of god. wherefore
me thinks he should have either borne and winked at the calling of this word
Resurrectio the life aftir this / since yt so signifies / or have patiently
abode^ wother mennis judgment / rather then with so sclaunderes a pistle / so
suddenly to have rent and torn my name with so perpetual an Infamye and with
so many feigned lies. which all God forgive the man as I would be forgeuen my
nown self Amen.
