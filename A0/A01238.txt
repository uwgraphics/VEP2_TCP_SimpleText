THE DECLARATION AND INFORMATION Of the High and Puissant King of Bohemia,
against the unjust Mandates published in the name of the Emperor: As also
against those that are further threatened to be decreed and executed, touching
the Crown of BOHEMIA.

M.D.C.XX.

The Declaration and Information of the high and puissant King of BOHEMIA,
against the unjust Mandates published in the name of the Emperor; as also
against those that are further threatened to be decreed and executed, touching
the Crown of BOHEMIA.
WE, Frederick, by the grace of God, King of Bohemia, Count Palatine of the
Rheine, and Prince Elector, Duke of Bauaria, Marquis of Morauia, Duke of
Lutzelburge and Silesia, Marquis of upper and lower Luzatia, etc. To all
Christian Potentates, Princes Electors, Princes, and States in general, and to
every one of them in particular; as also to all others of what quality, state,
or condition so ever they be; make known our willing service, friendship, and
gracious will, giving them hereby to understand, that we have been certainly
and most truly informed, in what manner not long since, under the name of the
Emperors Majesty, diverse rigorous, and unaccustomed Mandates and Patents, (to
our most great prejudice, defamation, and dishonor) have been here and there
dispersed, as well within as without the Empire, and in some places publicly
set up: Thereby under pretense of all manner of untrue narrations and frivolous
suggestions, pretending, that our true and lawful Election unto the Kingdom
of Bohemia, made and performed by the general unanimous consent and agreement
of the States of the said Kingdom of Bohemia, together with the Countries
thereunto incorporated, is utterly void, and de facto, of no force, or of none
effect. And withal affirming, that all the Princes, States, and Members of the
Empire, (which hitherto out of a Christian compassion, have in any manner and
by any means aided and assisted the oppressed Christians of the Kingdom of
Bohemia and the incorporated Countries thereunto annexed, inhumanely persecuted
and molested by extreme Tyrannies, Murders, Robberies, Burnings, and innocent
bloud-shedding) are by the said Declarations, and Letters Pattents, upon the
avoiding of the actual declaration and execution of the pains and penalties in
that case set down and appointed by the Imperial constitutions, commanded and
strictly enjoined to leave ayding and assisting of the said greatly persecuted
and oppressed Christians, and specially Us, their now orderly elected and
lawfully crowned King. And further, by most frivolous untrue and slanderous,
imputations against us, and with like severe menacings, by Imperial power,
within a certain time therein limited and set down; commanding Us,
expressly, without any delay, certainly, infallibly and actually to abandon,
leave, and give over our said Kingdom of Bohemia, and the Countries
incorporated thereunto, obtained by so just and lawful a Title, and being in
undeniable just possession.

Now setting apart that, which to the slander and disgrace of the States of
Bohemia, has at large (though untruly) been published concerning the
displacing and remoouing of certain unfit, perverse and turbulent Officers,
alteration of Government, and establishing of Orders for the natural defense
and protection of their Subjects, whereunto by nature they are bound:

As also that, which for the confirmation of the pretended imaginary claim of
Inheritance made by the house of Austria to the said kingdom, may be, and is
produced and objected, out of the slender, insufficient and partial
Declaration made by the Emperor Charles the Fourth; concerning the free
Election belonging to the Bohemians; as also from that vnformal and disorderly
private testification made by King Vladislaus; and of that out of the Decree,
seven and forty years since, by fire and sword compulsiuely extorted and
wrung from the assembly of the States in Parliament at Prague; together with
the ill alleged observation of their pretended eight hundred years
succession. Since that all these things have been fully answered and confuted
by the Apologies and deductarie Declarations made and published by the said
States, with such truth and good ground, as that we think it needless here to
rehearse or deduce the same again at large.

Only for the better and plainer justification of our own Person, we say that
we doubt not, but that all men of indifferent and unpassionate minds, (that
have seen and read our Declaration dated the twentieth of October (and seventh
of November) published in Prague, and the Bohemian deduction therein mentioned
and set down,) sufficiently perceive and understand, upon what most urgent and
inevitable reasons and motives, after so great and notorious necessities,
calamities, and miseries endured, and thereby enforced defense; the said States
of the renowned Kingdom of Bohemia, together with the Provinces incorporated
to the same, have been forced and compelled unto that wel-ordered abdication
and reiection, to them permitted both by the Laws of God and man, and by
virtue of their lawful privileges hitherto inuiolably maintained. And by what
occasion we for our parts have been moved, and incited to accept of the said
vacant Crown, (unexpected by us, and without any thought of Ours) and lawfully
cast upon us by a joint, free, and general assembly of the States of the
Kingdom of Bohemia, according to the ancient Privileges and Freedom of
Election reserved unto them by their fundamental Laws. As also that in the
acceptance thereof we never had any respect to the further advancement or
increasing of our own dignity, and present particular profit, but chiefly and
before all things to the glory of God, the common welfare of our native
Country, and as much as possibly might be, to the preservation of this famous
Kingdom, and Electorate Principality there, by hostile power and force almost
utterly spoiled and ruinated; withal having commiseration and taking pity
upon the miseries, sighs, and lamentable tears which we had before our eyes
of so many poor distressed Christians. And therefore with our pure consciences
we do now again testify, that if by the refusal of this Crown then offered
unto us, we might have been a means that the devouring fire of dissension
raised in the said Kingdom and the Territories thereof, (and still more and
more increasing) might have been quenched, the persesecution for Religion
ceased, their infringed Privileges restored, the Country freed and secured
from menaced bondage and suppression, and the Empire also, and specially we
our selves, and other States bordering about us, freed from apparent dangers:
We would not only have refused the acceptance of the said Crown offered unto
us, but most willingly have employed our uttermost endeavor in that behalf.

And we hope, that no man to whom our actions and proceedings, from and before
the beginning of these troubles raised in Bohemia, are known and made
manifest, can as well any ways doubt of our sincerity, seeing it is
undeniable, that we not only particularly, but jointly also with other godly
and true hearted Princes Electors, and Princes, presently upon their very
first bursting out, as upon the increasing of this hurtful fire, for the
prevention of ensuing mischiefs, have not spared nor refused to use any good
means, nor to give any true and upright counsel therein. To the which end, at
the last election day holden in Frankefort, by our fully authorized deputies,
(together with the advice and counsel of our fellow temporal Princes
Electors) we did most faithfully and diligently labor, and gave our advice,
to procure, that before we handled or dealt in any other matter, the hostile
troubles raised in the Empire, and specially in the Kingdom of Bohemia, might
first be brought and reduced to a peaceable and quiet State; for the effecting
whereof, we wished and desired nothing more, then that the Ambassadors of the
States of Bohemia, then sent to Frankefort, (which by our deputies was
oftentimes moved) at their instant request might have been admitted and heard,
and not (as they were) so contemptuously rejected and put off.

And the electorall Records of the last proceedings in the said Election at
Franckfort, can witness, That our fully authorized deputies were as unwilling
unto the said contumelious refusal of the Bohemian Ambassadors, as we were
ready to the approving and admission of his Imperial Majesty (as King of
Bohemia) into the electorall College; but rather oftentimes have protested and
declared, that we by no means would derogate any thing from the liberties and
rights of the States of the Crown of Bohemia, nor thereby in any manner seek
to prejudice either the one or the other.

Therefore, because such good and faithful admonitions, advice, and
protestations could take no effect, but to the contrary, the said Ambassadors
of the States of Bohemia (against their ancient national Laws and
Privileges) were constrained with great disgrace to go home again unheard;
their propositions set down in writing, not propounded nor read in the
Electorall College, nor yet the cause orderly and lawfully discussed and
handled, (the Country in the mean time being so grievously afflicted, by
continual and most extreme hostility and deuastation) as the like has not
been heard of:

So that the interposition then made and propounded to the electorall College
(which notwithstanding required much time, and in the mean while the Kingdom
of Bohemia might have been utterly spoiled and overthrown) could not be
brought to any effectual treaty, neither was by the contrary part earnestly,
nor with befitting zeal esteemed of, nor considered upon, as conveniently it
ought to have been; but much rather, purposely the business was delayed, that
so in the mean time the Country might be weakened and tired out.

For these considerations, the States at that time assembled together in the
City of Prague, being then in danger of falling into most great extremity
and distress, as also despayring of any equal and impartial redress of that
the contumelious reiection and refusal of their said Ambassadors; were
constrained and forcibly compelled, to undertake some other means (by virtue
of their ancient and legal privileges) and to proceed to the lawful
alteration of the Crown, as it is now known unto the World: thereby to
preserve and save themselves from utter ruin and final destructions, as by
their public Apologies and Deductions set forth, and imprinted, does
sufficiently and at large appear.

From whence all men, yea also every simple man, may easily know and perceive,
That the causes and motives, whereby the States of Bohemia, and the Provinces
thereinto incorporated, were enforced to this final resolution, are not in any
manner to be ascribed unto us, whose care and endeavor still was employed by
all the means that could be, to procure that peace, quietness, and concord,
might be again reduced, and re-established within the holy Empire; as also,
that in the said Kingdom of Bohemia (as a special and principal Electorall
Principality) the troubles raised and begun, might be appeased, and the same
reduced to a peaceable and quiet State: But much rather unto those, who at the
very beginning, (preferring force of arms before friendly means) at the
aforesaid Electorall day, neglected, and rejected all good counsel,
admonition, and protestations; seeking all the means and ways they could, to
advance and effect that their so long before premeditated intent and secret
meaning.

And the process of these affairs manifestly show, how little the contrary
part is and has bin inclined to any peaceable course of proceeding, as their
actions sufficiently testify; and especially hereby, in that we (at the
beginning of our Regal government) when occasion was motioned of entering
into a peaceable treaty, willingly offered to yield thereunto. The same was
notwithstanding by them utterly refused and rejected.

And whereas it is imputed unto us, as if we by our accepting and taking of
the Crown offered unto us, both orderly, and without all intrusion, and
(according to the ancient Laws and fundamental Ordinances of the Kingdom of
Bohemia, and their old customs) by lawful precedent abdication altogether
free and vacant) should thereby rebelliously and by force of arms, have, of
our own actual manner, undertaken to pull away the said Kingdom and
Provinces incorporated unto the same, from his Imperial Majesty, contrary to
the common peace of the Empire: therein we find our self to be altogether
over much wronged, and may in regard thereof, undergo and stand unto the
censure of all indifferent persons, both within and without the Empire. For
seeing that by the forementioned several published deductorie Writings of the
worthy Bohemian States, not only their right and lawful causes of undertaken
Reiection, but also their anciently descended, and well grounded lawful Right
of free Election: and that no man with equity, nor upon any good ground or
solid reason, and just foundation, can boast of any lawful succession to the
said Realm; much less by dangerous conuentions, cessations, and transports
(wholly opposite to the Fundamental Laws) made against and without the
knowledge and consent of the said States, transport the often foresaid Kingdom
of Bohemia, and propriety of the Empire, and other the noble Countries, unto
any outlandish strangers:

That all men may sufficiently perceive what great wrong and injustice is
offered thereby unto us, by proceeding against us in such manner, who never
sought nor desired to wrong any one, nor take away against right from any man
(of how mean estate soever he were) any thing that belonged unto him.

And although the Emperors Majesty within a short time after our Coronation,
in an edict published before this latter Mandate, by diverse colorable
circumstances and allegations, has taken upon him, not only to contradict,
but altogether to annihilate and make void the aforesaid Reiection, Election,
and Coronation made, and conferred upon us by the said States of the Crown of
Bohemia: We doubt not, but that every man may easily judge, and discern that
his Majesty, (who in this cause touching the said States of Bohemiaes
Abdication or Reiection, and thereupon ensuing Election and Coronation,
presumes upon certain suppositions, and pretenses of the house of Austria,
being but a party plaintiff) is not for himself to judge, whether the States
of Bohemia have herein done lawfully, and according to their ancient Laws and
privileges; and so whether the new Election be in force, and of sufficiency,
or not: nor can he be warranted by any Law, or under any color of absolute
Imperial authority, power, and Sovereignty, to advance and press through the
private dessignes and particular Austrian pretenses, with peremptory process
of execution, and by his own power to make himself judge in his own cause,
contrary to all the Laws and Ordinances of the Empire; no more then the
deceassed Emperors Frederick, Charles, Rodulph, and others, in their own
particular controversies, and pretenses against any of the States of the
Empire, did ever undertake and assume unto themselves, to be both Judges and
parties.

Besides this; The States of the Crown of Bohemia, and the provinces
incorporated to the same, acknowledge not any jurisdiction or Superiority in
the Emperor, in or over the Kingdom, (excepting that which concerns the
Feudarie Lands had from the holy Empire) because they are not subject to the
Roman Emperor, nor to any of the holy Empires censurers, Note this well.
either at the Imperial Court, nor in the Chamber at Spires; nor also to any
other constitutions of the Empire, nor Assemblings and common decidings,
decrees, Tracts, and decisions of the Empire, but have their own ancient
Country Laws, Privileges, Ordinances, Exemptions, and Customs, whereby they
are governed.

Whereby it easily appears, how unseasonably and without reason, the
Emperors privy Council in this private business arrogate against us unto
themselves the office of Judges, whereunto in regard of their Persons or
Qualities they are not called; nor by the temporal Princes Electors, and other
Princes, are acknowledged or deemed to be such as are worthy, of their own
authority to assume such Princes power, as by such unfit and disordered
process, of no force nor validity, to proceed against a King, and a Prince
Elector.

But if his Imperial Majesty, as Archduke of Austria, be resolved orderly and
by due course of Law to prosecute and produce his pretended hereditarie claim
to the Crown of Bohemia, then he ought not to do it before his own privy
Council and servants, A point very obseruable.
but (according to the Laws and Privileges of the Crown of Bohemia) before
their own Judges, unto whom such high and weighty causes do appertain, and
must as plaintiff and actor Forum rei, sue and follow the same, before them,
and according to the Ordinances of the general Common Law: as on the other
side, if as Emperor of Rome, he be sued by order of Law, by any other,
according to the golden Bull of Charles the Fourth, he ought to appear,
plead, and answer before a Palsgraue and Prince Elector; and therefore neither
can nor ought to be his own Judge. As now it is to be hoped, that no
impartial person whatsoever may any ways doubt of the insufficiency and
manifest nullitie of the aforesaid pretended Imperial Edict of cassation: So
likewise, we are fully persuaded, that from the same or the like grounds, no
man will nor can, but hold and esteem the already thereupon ensued Imperial
rigorous mandates; as also all such others which are threatened, as may
hereafter follow, and be made against us, or others, either belonging unto us,
or aiding of us; to be void and of none effect (as in very truth of
themselves they are) and which we (as occasion serves, and our necessity
requires) are determined in all events as is lawfully permitted unto us, to
withstand and repugne; in as much as the said proceedings derived from a
passionate mind, and concerning his own private pretended right, are done
without any lawful examination or knowledge of the cause, and then specially
when his Majesty has already hitherto chosen another course by force of
arms, and therein has not omitted any kind of hostility whatsoever; and
whereby he has directly not only proceeded contrary to the common Laws of
all Nations, but also against the good and profitable Constitutions of the
Empire, and the Sacred corporal Oath ratified by Imperial Capitulation,
whereunto his Majesty also has bound and obliged himself, in these words
following:

That neither he, nor any other for him, or in his name or behalf, will or
shall, by violence or force, molest or trouble any of the Princes Electors,
Princes, Prelates, Earls, Barons, nor other States of the Empire, in any
manner: But that, if his Imperial Majesty himself, or any other particular
person, has right or cause to demand or sue for any thing of them all in
general, or of any of them in particular (for the avoiding and preventing of
all dissentions, troubles, and other inconveniences in the Empire, thereby to
preserve and maintain peace and unity) he will and shall proceed by lawful
order and process; and in such cases, where he or they may have justice by
Law, be willing to submit themselves thereunto: and will by no means, nor
under any pretense whatsoever, permit nor suffer them to be molested, hurt, or
invaded by war, burning, defiances, or any other manner of hostility
whatsoever. That his Majesty also shall foresee, and hereafter by no means
suffer nor permit, that any of the States, of high or low degree, Princes
Electors, Princes, or any others, shall without just cause and lawful
audience, wrongfully be proclaimed or declared guilty of proscription and
banishment: But that all cases shall be proceeded in according to the
ordinary process, and the holy Roman Empires Laws established, to the
direction of the Laws of the holy Empire, and the reformed order held in the
Imperial Chamber, and agreeably be fully and strictly observed and followed.

And then lastly, that his Majesty (contrary to the golden Bull, and other
Laws and Ordinances of the holy Empire) shall not in any manner, nor by any
means, of his own authority, send out any Rescript, Mandate, or other
prejudicial Commission, nor by way of entreatie procure the same from any
other magistrate whatsoever: with this express clause, That if any thing
repugnant to the aforesaid Articles and special points, be either obtained, or
sent forth, that the same shall be in all respects wholly frustrate, void, and
of no force at all.

As therefore in this present difference, wherein We now are at controversy
with the Emperous Majesty, concerning the private particular pretense which
he makes (as Archduke of Austria) unto our lawfully possessed Kingdom of
Bohemia, and the Provinces incorporated thereunto, We are not as yet at all
summoned by ordinary course of Law, to appear, which We are ready and
willing to do and perform, so it be in an indifferent and convenient place,
and before impartial Judges (according to the privileges of Bohemia:) So no
man can nor ought to think hardly of Us, for refusing to obey the Imperial
Monitorie Mandate, published and sent forth against Us, bearing date the 30. of
April last past; as being wholly opposite and contrary to all the Laws and
Ordinances of the Empire, and which also is by virtue of the aforesaid
Imperial Capitulation, and the golden Bull, of it self frustrate, void, and
of none effect at all.

And We also hope, that other States and fellow members of the Empire (that
have not as yet openly submitted themselves unto the Spanish servitude, or that
have not betaken themselves unto the service of that House,) will not be moved
by the said Imperial Mandate to them directed (which for the reasons aforesaid
is of no force) to desist from their most commendable intents and purposes,
which hitherto they have had, for the glory of God, and the comfort and
consolation of so many poor Christians wrongfully oppressed. And the rather,
for that we are persuaded no man of understanding that is not led by untimely
immoderate affection, or blinded with private considerations and imaginary
respects, can judge or censure, that We or Our assistants have in the least
respect done any thing contrary to the Constitutions of the Empire, by means
of this our firm resolution, which We have bin, and are forced to take against
the Emperors Majesty; not as he is Roman Emperor, (for in that respect We
neither do, nor will derogate any thing from him, but rather, according to the
Imperial Laws, in all things duly honor and respect him) but as Archduke of
Austria, in regard of his pretended particular and private pretenses. And
therefore, that neither by law nor equity do the penalties set down in the
said actual peremptory menacing Declaration and Execution, (as grounded upon
the Constitutions of the Empire) belong unto Us, and so much the less, seeing
they pretend, that the hitherunto attempted and the hereafter further threatened
process, is grounded upon the Empires Constitutions, which yet are not by Us
at all: but much rather by them of the other part, clean laid aside, and
wholly neglected; yea, and in such manner so ouerstridden and transgressed, and
with such unheard of cruel insolences, by the foreign barbarous soldiers
who are brought in; as that the enforced Defense and Deliverance permitted by
all Laws Natural and National, neither can nor ought by any the like surmise
and color of Law, or other pretended ground of Reason whatsoever, be drawn
and taken at all away from the oppressed.

And if yet his Imperial Majesty (beyond all expectation) shall still suffer
himself to be so far transported and carried away, as that (not regarding nor
respecting the precious Oath he has taken) in respect of the claim he pretends
(against Us) to Our Crown of Bohemia, and the Provinces thereunto
incorporated; continually to molest and grieve Us, our friends, and Allies,
with intimated process of Proscription (ex authoritate propria) and of
himself actually proceed so far, especially as in hostile manner, to invade
our hereditarie Countries and Territories, and by that means (as he has
already done, and yet continues to do, both in the Kingdom of Bohemia, and
the neighboring confines thereof) occasion new commotions, distractions,
divisions, and alterations in other places of the Empire, and thereby (as much
as in him lies) seek to subvert and overthrow the public peace of the said
Empire: We must indeed then with patience commit our Cause unto God the highest
Judge, with assured confidence, that as hitherto We have palpably felt and
seen his great and wonderful providence, and mighty outstretched arm
extended toward Us, so We hope that his divine Omnipotence will also not
hereafter forsake nor abandon Us, but fatherly afford unto Us such means,
that, by his powerful assistance, We may be able to defend Our self and Our
right, against so unlawful wrongs, and unexpected barbarous attempts. And
hereby We do expressly and in the best manner that We may or can, truly
protest, both before God and man, that if, by further menacings, and unlawful
severe processes of Execution, a general fire of wars (which our good GOD
graciously auert) shall be kindled in Our native Country of Germany (as is to
be feared) that then the calamities and miseries that thereby may ensue, shall
not in any wise be laid upon, nor imputed unto Us; but unto those Counselors,
and Servants, that have not only neglected to put his Imperial Majesty in
remembrance of the Capitulation whereunto He has sworn (as by duty they were
bound) but also for their own benefit, particular commodity, and imaginary
greatness in the Country of Bohemia, and out of a reuengefull desire, have
ministered such means as in many particulars are directly against the aforesaid
Capitulation, and the common peace and tranquillity of the whole Country.

And this We thought expedient (as also our necessity requires) to give
notice of unto every one; verily hoping, that no man (who favors reason,
truth, and equity) upon the sight of this Our most true Information, can or
will be moved to censure badly of Us, or to distaste Our Actions, in regard of
his Majesty's frivolous Mandate (repugnant to Law and the Imperial
Capitulation) published and sent forth against Us, Our friends, Allies, and
adherents, in regard of this controversy that We have with his Majesty, as
Archduke of Austria: nor suffer any taxations toward the performance of the
execution of such private pretenses, to be laid or louied upon them; which the
House of Austria it self, did never heretofore respect nor account of, nor yet
ever did any thing or contributed in the like cases of Execution, but did ever,
and upon all occasions, wholly exempt and free themselves from the same.

In regard whereof, the Princes Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire, at
this time, have less cause to trouble and to burden themselves therewith on
the behalf of the said House of Austria, against Us; but on the contrary, to
be ready and willing, if We or Ours, in manner aforesaid, shall be assaulted
and invaded, to aid and assist Us with their advice and means, and according
to the Order of Executions, (which We ever, and at all times, have duly
respected and observed;) and so much the rather, to afford Us their help, for
that every particular Grant, Tract, and State of the Empire, ought, and is
reciprocally bound to aid and assist each other, in the like hostile
oppression and invasion. To the which, hereby We most friendly, lovingly, and
graciously incite them, with promise when occasion shall be offered, to
requite them with the like.

Given at Prague the 1. of July, 1620.
