IHon by the providence of God Bishop of London. To all Parsons, Vicars,
Curates and Churchwardens within the City of London, and the Counties of
Middlesex and Essex, Greeting.
Whereas this bearer Thomas Butler of the town of Colchester, within the
County of Essex aforesaid Gunpowdermaker, being at work for the making of
Gunpowder in the County of Kent, about five years now past, by sudden
misfortune was pitifully burnt and spoiled of his Eyes and Arms apparent yet
to behold, then losing all that he had, and since brought greatly indebted, and
where also the Byaliffes of the said town of Colchester tenderly respecting
his woeful and diseased estate, directed their certificate to the right
honorable the Lord Chauncelor of England, thereby beseeching his Lordship to
grant unto him her Majesty's lycense under the great Seal of England, to
ask the charity of well disposed people in several Counties, to which the
Lord Chauncelor of his wonted clemency granted, but now the said Thomas
Butler by reason of extreme poverty, is far unable to compass the chardge
of getting out the said Seal. Therefore these are to request you, and every
one of you, to whom these presents shall come, that you read and publish
this in your Churches, and other places of assemblies, moving the people to
extend their benevolence and charity upon this poor man, that he may the
better be able to obtain his said request. And this present writing to
continue for the space of one whole year next ensuing after the date hereof.

In witness whereof: I have set to my hand and Seal the xv. of September, in
the xxviii. year of her Majesty's most gracious reign that now is. God save
the Queen.
