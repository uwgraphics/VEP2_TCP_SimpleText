THE CHERRIE and the Slaye.
ABout ane bank, quhair birds on bewes, ten thousand times yair notes renewes
ilk hour into the day:
The Merle, the Maveis may be seine, the Progney and the Philomeine, quhilk
caussit me to stay:
I lay and leind me to ane busse, to heir their birdis beir,
Their noyce are so melodiousse, throw natour of the zeir:
Some singing, some springing, with wingis into the sky:
So nymlie and trimly, their birds they flew me by.
I saw the Hurchone and the Hair, quha fed amang the flowers fair, that
hopping to and fro:
I saw the Cunnin and the Cat. quhais downs with the dew was wat, with other
beastis mo:
The Hairt the Hynd, the Dae the Rae, the Fulmarte and the Fox:
Were skippand all from bray to bray, amang the watte^ brox.
Some feiding, some dreiding, in caice of sudden snairis,
Some tripping, some skipping, they huntit all in pairis.
The air was so attemperat, but any mist immaculat, both puryfeit and cleir:
The flouris fair ware flurischit, as natour had them nurischit, both
delicate and deir:
And every blome on branche and bewche, so prettily was spread:
Syne hang their heids out over ane hewehe, in Mayis color cled:
Some knopping, some dropping, the balmie liquour sweit:
Distelling and smelling, throw Phoebus health some heit.
The Cuckoe and the Cuschate cryit, the Turtill on the other side, no plesour
had to play:
So schill in sorrow was her sang, that throw her voce the roches rang, and
Ecchoe answerit aye:
Lamenting sair Narcisses case, that steruit at the well:
Quhairthrowe the shadow of his face, for luife that slew him sell:
Sair weiping and creiping, about the well he baid:
Quhyllis lying, quhyllis crying, bot it na answer maid.
The dew as Dyamondis did hing, upon the tender tuistis zing, over twinkling
all the treis:
And ay quhair flouris flourischit fair, their suddenly I saw repair, ane
swarm of sownding beeis:
Some sweitly hes the honey socht, quhill they ware cloggit soire:
Some cunningly the wax hes wrocht, to heap it up in stoire:
So heiping for keiping, into their hyues they hydit:
Preciselie and wisely, for winter they prouydit.
To pen the plesouris of that Park, how every blome on branche and bark, aganes
the Sun did schine:
I leife their Poets to compyle, in staitlie verse and ornat style, it passis my
Ingyne:
Bot as I muissit mine allane,
I saw ane River rin:
Out over ane Craig and rock of stane, syne lichtit in ane lin:
With tumbling and rumbling, amang the rocks round:
Devalling and falling into that pit profound.
To heir the startling streams cleire,
I thocht it music to the eire, quhair deskant did abound:
With treble sweet and tenor just, and ay the echo repercust, the Diapason
sound.
Set with the C. sol fa ut cleife, quhairby to know the note,
They sownd ane michtie semebreife, out of the Elphis throat.
Discreitlie mair sweitlie, nor crafty Amphion:
Nor muisses that uses, at fountain Helicon.
Quha wald have tyrit to heir that tune, quhilk birds corroborate abune, throw
schouting of the Larkis:
Quha flewe sa hie into the skyis, quhil Cupid walknit throw the cryis, of
natures chapel clarkis:
Quha leueing all the heuins above, syne lichtit on the eird:
Lo how that littil God of love, befoir me their appeird:
So mild like and childlike, with bow thrie quartars scante:
So moylike and coylike, he luikit like ane Sancte.
Ane cleinly cirspe hang over his eyes, his quauer be his naikit thies, hang in
ane silver lace:
Of gold betwein his schoulders grew, two proper wings quhairwith he flewe, on
his left arm ane brace:
This God of all his geire he schuik, and laid it on the ground:
I ran als bessie for to luik, quhair farleyis micht be found:
Amazed I gazed, to sie that geir sa gay:
Persaueing my haueing, he comptit me his pray.
Quhat wald thou give my friend quod he, till have their pretty wings to fly,
to sport thee for ane quhile:
Or quhat gif I should lend thee heir, my bow and all my schuitting geir, some
body to begvle?
That geir quod I cannot be bocht, zit wald I have it feign:
Quhat gif quod he it cost thee nocht,
Bot rander it again:
His wings than he brings than, and band them on my bak:
Go fly now quod he now, and so my leife I tak.
I sprang so heich on Cupids wings, quha bow and quauer both resings, to lend
me for ane day:
As Icarus with borrowit flicht, quha mountit heicher nor he micht, ore
perrellous ane play:
Than forth he drew that deadly dairt, quhilk sometime hurt his mother:
Quhairwith I hurt my wanton hairt, in hope to hurt ane other:
It hurt me and brunt me, the ofter I it handle:
Cumesie now in me now, the Butterfly and candle.
As scho delyttis into the low, so was I browdin on my bow, as ignorant as
scho:
And as scho flies quhill scho be fyrit, so with the dairt that I desyrit, my
handis hes hurt me to:
As fulisch Phaetone be suite, his fathers cairte obteind:
I langit in luiffis bow to schuite, and wist not quhat it meind:
Moir wilful nor skillful, to fly I was so fond:
Desyring Impyring, and so was seen appond.
To lait I know quha hewes to hie, the speill sall fall into his eye, to lait I
went to schools:
To lait I hard the swallow preich, to lait experience dois teich, the
School-maister of fools:
To lait I find the nest I seik, quhen all the birdis aie flowne:
To lait the stabill dure I steik, quhen all the steids are stolen:
To lait ay their state aye, all foolish folk espy:
They find to behind to, remeid and so do I.
Bot had I ryplie been aduysit,
I had not raschelie interprysit, to soire with borrowit pennis:
Nor zit have say it the Archere craft, nor schot my self with sic ane schaft,
as ressoun quite miskennis:
Fra wilfulnes gaif me the wound,
I had na force to fly:
Thane come I grauand to the ground, friend welcome hame quod he:
Quhair flew ze, quhom slew ze, or quha bringis hame the buiting:
I see now, quod he now, ze have bein at the schuiting.
As scorn comes commonly with skaith, sa I behuifit to bide them both, oh!
quhat ane stakkarand stait:
For under cuire I got sik check, that I micht neither muife nor neck, bot
ather stale or mait. mine agony was sa extreme,
I swate and swound for feire:
Bot or I walknit of my dream, he spuilzeit me of my geire:
With flichrthan, on hicht thane, sprang Cupid in the skyis:
Forzetting, and setting at nocht my cairfull cryis.
So long with sicht I follow it him, quhill both my febillit eyis grew dim,
throw stairing on the starnes.
Quhilk flawe so thick before my eyne,
Some reid, some yeallowe, blew and greine, quhilk trubillit all my harnes:
Quhill every thing appeirit two, to my barbruilzeit brain:
Bot lang micht I lie luiking tho, or Cupid come again:
Quhais thundering, with wondering,
I hard up throw the air:
Throw cloudis so, he thuids so, and flewe I wist not quhair.
Bot fra I saw that God was gane, and I in langour left allane, and soire
tormentit to:
Sumtyme I sicht quhill I was sad, sumtyme I muissit and may gane mad,
I wist not quhat to do:
Sumtyme I ravit half in ane rage, as ane into despair:
To be oppressed with sik ane page
Lord gif my hairt was saire:
Like Dido, Cupido,
I widill and I warye:
Quha left me, and reft me in sic ane furye farye.
Thane felt I currage and desire, inflame my hairt with vncowth fire, to me
befoir vnknaw in:
Bot now na bluid in me remains vnbrunt and bruilzeit throw my veins, be
luiffis bellows blawin:
To quench it or I was devorit, with siches I went about:
Bot ay the moire I schape to smorit, the baulder it brak out:
Aye pressing, but sessing, quhil it may breik the bounds:
My hew so, forth schew so, the dolor of my wounds.
With deadly visage paill and wan, mair like ane attomie nor man,
I widderit cleine away:
As wax befoir the fire I felt my hairt within my bosom melt, and piece and
piece decay:
My veins with brangling like to brek, my punsis lap with pithe:
So ferventlie did me infek, that I am vexed thairwith:
My hairt ay, did start ay,
The fiery flames to fly:
Aye houping, throw louping, to win to liberty,
Bot zit allace bide it behuiffit, within my cairfull corpis incluissit, and
pressone of my breist:
With sichis so soippit and oresette, like to ane fische fast in the net, in
deadthraw vndeceist:
Quhais thocht in vain dois strive for strenth for to pull out her head:
Quhilk profeittis nathing at the lenth, bot haistes her to her dead.
Ay wristing and thristing, the faster still is scho:
And I so dois lie so, my death avanceing to.
The mair I wressellit with the wind, the faster still my self I find, na
mirth my mind could mease:
Mair noye nor I tried never nane,
I was sa alterrit and oregane, throw drowth of my disease:
Zit weaklie as I micht I rayis, my sicht grew dim and dark:
I stakkerit at the windilstrayis, no takin I was stark:
Both sichtles, and michtles,
I grew almaist attanes:
In anguisch, I languisch, with money grievous granes.
With sober pace I did approach hard to the River and the roche, quhairof I
spak befoir:
Quhais running sick ane murmr maid, as to the sey it swiftly slaid, ore
craig, ore clewch, ore schoir:
Their plesoure did me so prouok, perforce for to repair:
Betuix the River and the rock, quhair hoipe grew with despair:
Ane try their, I see their, of cherreis on the brais,
Belawe to, I saw to ane bush of bitter Slais.
The Chirries hang abutie my heid, like twinkling rewbeis round and reid, so
hich up in the hewch:
Quhais schaddowes in the River schew,
Als graithlie glansing as they grew, on trimbling twistis tewch:
Quhilk bowed throw burding of their birth, in hanging down their toppis:
Reflexe of Phoebus in the firth, orecouerit all the knoppis: with dansing, and
glansing, in tirles dornik champ:
Quhilk streimet, and gleimet, throw lichtnes of that lamp.
With earnest eye I can espy, the fruit betwix me and the sky, half gaite
almaist to hevin:
The craige so cumbersome to clime, the try so hich of growth and trime, as
any arrowe evin:
I call to mind how Daphne did, within the Laurel schrink:
Quhen from Appollo scho her hid, ane thousand times I think:
That try then, to me then, as hich as laurel thocht:
Espyring, but tyring, to get the fruit I socht.
To clime the Craige it was na buit,
Iat be to press to pull the fruit, in top of all the try:
I saw na way quhairby to cum, be any craft to get it clum, appeirandly to me:
The craig was ugly stay and dreiche, the try heich lang and sinal:
I was effrayit to mount so heich, for feir to get ane fall:
I freyit, to sey it,
I luikit up on loft:
Quhillis minting, quhillis stinting, my purpose changit often.
Thane dreid with danger and despair, forbad me mounting any maire, to raxe
abune my reiche:
Quhat? tusch quod curage man go to, he is but daft that hes ado, that stay is
for every speiche:
For I have often hard wise men say, and we may sie it our selfis:
That fortune helps the hardy ay, and pultrones plain repellis:
Thane feir not, nor heir not, dreid danger or despair:
To fazarts, hard hazarts, is dead or they come thaire.
Quha speids botsik as hie aspyris, quha tryumphis not botsic as tyris, to win
ane nobill name:
Ofschrinking quhat? bot schame succeidis, thane do as thou wald have thy
deidis, in register of fame:
I put the caice thou not preuaill, swa thou with honor die:
Thy life bot not thy curage faill, sall Poettis pen of thee.
Thy name than, from fame than, sall never be cut aff:
Thy grave aye, sall haueaye, ane honest Epitaphe.
Quhat can thou lose quhen honor lives, renown thy vertewe ay reviues, gif
vailzeantly thou end:
Quod danger hulie friend tak heid, vntymeous spurring spillis the speid, tak
tent quhat ze pretend:
Thocht currage counsall thee to clim, beware thou kep na skaith:
Have thou na help bot hope in him, he may begyle ze both:
Thy sell now, can tell now, the counsall of these clarkis:
Quhairthrow zit, I trow zit, thy breist dois beir the markis.
Brynt bairne with fire, the danger dreids,
Sa I belief thy bossome bleids, sen first the fire thou felt:
Besides that sendill times thou seis, that every currage keipis the key is, of
knawledge be his belt:
Thocht he bid fordwart with the gunnes, small poulder he provides:
Be not ane novis of the Nuns, that sies not both the sides:
Fuill haist aye, almaist aye, oresertis the sicht of some:
Quha huiks not, nor luiks not, quhat esterward may come.
Zit wisdom wisses thee to wie, the sentence of Philosophy: ane lessoun worth
to leir:
Quhilk is in time for to tak tent, and not quhen time is past repent, and buy
repentance deir:
Is their na honor after life, except thou slay thy sell:
Quhairfoir hes Attropus the knyfe,
I trow thou can not tell.
That but it, wald cut it, that Clotho skairse hes spun:
Distroying, thy joying, befoire it be begun.
All owers ar recknit to be vice, ore hie, ore law, ore rich, ore wyis: ore
heit, or zit ore cauld:
Thou seems unconstant be thy sings, thy thocht is on ane thousand things,
thou wattis not quhat thou wald:
Let fame her pity on the pour, quhill all thy banes ar brokin:
Zone Slaye suppose thou think it sour, may satisfy to flokkin:
Thy thrist now, I traist now, gif that thou wald it preife:
I say to, it may to, thy painis all releise.
Quhat fuill art thou to die for thrist, and syne may quench it quhen thou
list, so easily but pain:
Maire honor is to vanquischane, nor feicht with tensum and be taken, and ather
huit or slain:
Now all the practick is to pass, and not to interprise,
Now as good drinking out of glass, as gold in any wise.
I had lever, have ever, ane foull in hand or tway:
Nor seand, ten fleand, above me all the day.
Luik quhair thou licht befoir thou loupe, and slip na certainty for hope,
quha gydis thee but be guess:
Quod currage cowartis takis na cuire, to sit with schame sa they besuire,
I like them all the less:
Quhat plesour purchessit is but pain, or honor woone with ease:
He will not lie quhair he is slain, that dourtis befoir he deis.
For feir then, I heir than, bot only ane remeid:
That lattis, and yattis for to cut off the heid.
Quhat is the way to heall thy hurt, quhat way is their to stay thy sturt,
quhat means may make thee merry:
Quhat is the comfort that thou craves, suppois the Sophists thee dessaues,
thou knawis it is the Cherrie:
Sen for it only thou bot thristis, the Slae can be nabuit:
In it also thy health consistis, and in na other fruit:
Thou quaikis aye, and schaikis aye, and studies at our strife:
Advise ye, it lyis ye, on na less nor thy life.
Gif any patient wald be panssit, quhy should he loup quhen he is lanceit, or
schrink quhen he is schorne:
For I have hard Chirurgianes say, often times defferrand of the day, may not be
mend the morn:
Tak time in time or time be tint, for time will not remain:
Quhat forssis fire out of the flint, bot als hard match again:
Delay not, nor stay not, and thou sall sie it sa:
Sic gettis ay, as settis ay, stout stomakis to the bray.
Thocht all beginnings be most hard, the end is pleasant efterward, now schrink
not for ane schoure:
Fra anes that thou thy grening get, thy pain and travel is forzet, the sweet
exceids the sour:
Go to now quickly, fear not their, for hope good hap hes heichte:
Quod danger be not suddane schir, the matter is of weichte:
First spy both, and try both, aduisement dois na ill:
I say to, you may to, be wilful quhen you will.
Bot zit to mind their proverbs call, quha vsis perrellis perrisch sall, schort
quhile their lyffis lastis:
And I have hard that hope quod he, maid never schip to saill the sea, that for
all perrils castis:
How many throw despair ar dead, that never perrellis preiuit:
How many also as we read, of lives hes been releiuit:
Some deing, some being, but danger or despair:
Ane hunder, I wonder, that I have hard declair.
Gif we two hald not up thy hairt, quhilk is the chief and nobillest pairt,
thy wark will not gang weill:
Considdering that companions can, persuade ane silly sempill man, to haissard
for his heill:
Suppois they have disswadit some, or we and they micht meit:
They get na credit quhair we come, in any man of spreit:
Be ressoun, their tressoun, be us was first espyit:
Reveilling, their deilling, quhilk dowe not be denyit.
With sleikit sonats seiming sweit, as all their doings war discreit, they wis
thee to be wise:
Postponing time from hour to hour, bot faith in underneath the flour, the
lurking Serpentlyis:
Suppois thou seis her not ane styme, till time scho stang thy fute:
Persauis thou not quhat precious time, thy slewthing dois oreschute:
Allace man, thy case than, in lingering I lament:
Go to now, and do now, that curage be content.
Quhat gif melancholy come in, and get ane grip or thou begin, than is thy
labor lost:
For he will hald thee hard and fast, till time and place and all be past, that
thou give up the ghost:
Thane sall be gravin on the stane, quhilk on thy grave is laid:
Sometime there lived sic a ane, bot how sall it be said:
Heir lyis now, but prise now, into dishonors bed:
Ane cowart, as thou art, that from his fortune fled.
Imagine than gif thou were laid, in grave and syne micht heir that said, wald
thou not sweat for schame:
Yes faith, I dout not bot thou wald, thairfoir gif thou hes eyes behald, how
they wald smoir thy fame:
Go to, and make na mair excuse, now life or honor lose:
And ather them or us refuse, their is na other chose:
Considder, togidder, that we can never dwell:
At lenth aye, be strenth aye, sic pultrons we expel.
Quod danger sen I understand, that counsall can be na command,
I have na mair to say:
Except that gif he think it good, tak counsall zit or ze conclude, of wiser
men than they:
They ar bot witless, young and rasche, suppois they think us fleit:
Gif of our fellowschip you fasch, gang with them hardly be it:
God speid you, they leid you, that hes not meikill wit:
Expel us, and tell us, heirefter comes not zit.
Quhill danger and despair reteirit,
Experience came in and speirit, quhat all the matter meind:
With him came ressonn, wit and skill, and they began to speir at will, quhair
make ze to my friend:
To pull zone lusty cherrie lo, quod he, and not the slaye:
Quod they, is their na mair ado, or ze gang up the braye:
Bot to it, and do it, perforce the fruit to pluck:
Weill brother, some other, were better to conduck.
I grant ze may be good aneuch, bot zit the hassard of ane hewch, requyris ane
better gyde:
As wise as ze ar may gang wrang, thairfoir tak counsall or ze gang, of some
that stands beside:
Bot quhilk were zone thrie ze forbad, your company richt now:
Quod will, thrie prechours to perswad, the poyssonit Slae to pow:
They trattell, they rattell, ane lang half hour and mair:
Foul fall them, they call them, dreid danger and despair.
They ar maire faschious nor of feck, zone faissard durst not for his neck,
clime up the Craig with us:
For we determinate war to die, or else to clime zone Cherrie try, they baid
about the busse:
They ar conditionate like the Cat, that wald not weit her feit:
Bot zit gif of the fruit we gat, they wald be feign to eit:
Thocht they now, I say now, to haissard hes na heart:
Zit luck we, and pluck we, the fruit they wald have part.
Bot gif we get our voyage won, they sall not than our Cherrie con,
That wald not interprise:
Weill quod experience ze boist, both that comptis without his oist, often times
he comptis twice:
Ze sell the Bear skin on his bak, bot bide quhill ze it get:
Quhen ze have done its time to crak, fisch not befoire the net:
Quhat haist schir, ze taist schir, the Cherrie or ze pow it:
Beware zit, ze ar zit, mair talkatiue nor trowit.
Call danger back agane quod skill, and see quhat he can say to will,
We see him schod to strait:
We may not trow that ilk ane tells, quod curage we concludit else, he serves
not for our nait:
For I can tell you all perqueir, his counsall and ze will:
Quod will, quhairto should he come heir, he can not hald him still.
He speiks ay, and seiks ay, delayis of times be drifts:
He grieves us and deues us, with sophistries and schifts.
Quod ressoun, quhy was he debard, the tale is ill may not be hard, zit let us
heir him anes:
Thane danger to declaire begane, how hope and curage tuik the man, and led him
all their lanes:
For they wald haist him up the hill, but ather stop or stay:
And quha was welcomer nor will, he wald be foremaist ay:
He culd do, and should do, quha ever wald or nocht:
Sic speiding, preceiding, unlikely was, I thocht.
Thairfoir I wisse him to be war, and raschlie not to run ore far, with sic ane
gyde as ze:
Quod curage, friend I heir ze faill remember better on your taill, ze said it
micht not be:
Beside that ze wald not consent, that ever we should clim:
Quod will, for my part I repent, that we saw you or him:
For they ar, the stayer, of us als weill as he:
I think now, they schrink now, go fordwart let them be.
Go to quhat do we heir bot gucks, they say that voyage never lucks, quhair ilk
man hes ane voit:
Quod wisdom, grathlie schir I grant, we were the war your voite to want, some
sentence now I note:
Suppois ze speak it bot be guess, some fruit thairin I find:
Ze wald be fordwart I confess, and comes often times behind:
It may be, that they be, dissavit that never doutit:
Indeid schir, that heid schir, hes meikill wit about it.
Thane wilful will began to rage, and swear he fand na thing in age, bot
anger; ire and grudge:
And for my self quod he I sweir. to quite all my companions heir, and they
admit you Judge:
Experience is grown sa auld, that he begins to rave:
The laife but curage are sa cauld, ^a hassarting they have:
For danger, for stranger, hes ever maid them ware,
Go fra them, we pray them, that neither do nor dare.
Quhy may not we three lead this ane,
I led ane hundredth mine allane, but counsall of them all?
I grant quod wisdom ze have led, bot I wald speir how many sped, or fordward
but ane fall?
For their is nane or few I trow,
Experience can tell:
Men sayis that he may wite bot you, the first tvme that he fell:
He kens now quhais pens now; thou borrowit fra the Clarkis:
His wounds zit, quhilk sounds zit,
I trow dois heir the markis.
Than quod Experience is it true,
Will, flatterit him quhan that he slew, and set him in ane low:
Will, was his counsall and convoy, to borrowe fra the blindit boy, both quiver
and his bow:
Quhairwith befoir he seyit to schuit, he never yield to youth:
Nor zit had need of any fruit, to quench his deadly drouth:
Quhilk pynis him, and dwinis him, to deid I wat not how:
Gif Will than, did ill than, himself considder now.
For I Experience was their, like as I use to be all quhair: quhat time he
wytis will
To be the cause of his mischeife, for I my self can be ane preife, and
witness thairintill:
Their is na bounds bot I have been, nor heich things from me hid,
Nor secreit things bot I have seen, that he or any did:
Thairfoir now, na moir now, let him think to conceill:
For quhy now, evin I now, am detbond to reveill.
My custom is for to declair the truth, and nather eik nor pair for any man
ane jot:
Gif wilful will delytis in leis, exempill in thy self thou se is, how he can
turn his cote:
And with his language till allure thee for to brek thy banes:
Sometime ze saw gif ze war sure, thou vsit his counsall anes:
Quha wald zit, behauld zit, to wrak thee war than we:
Think on now, of zone now, quod wisdom than to me.
Than quod Experience gif that he, will come himself to you and me,
I wat quhat I should say:
Gif he be wise he sall not want, providing always that he grant, to put zone
will away:
And banisch both him and despair, that all good purpose spillis:
Swa he wald mell with us na mair, let them two flyte their fillis:
Sic coissing, but loissing, all honest men may use:
That change now, were strange now, quod ressoun to refuse.
Thane altogidder they began, to say come on thou martyrit man, and do as we
devise:
Abaisd ane bony quhile I baid, and muissit or I answer maid, and turnit me
anes or twice:
Behalding every ane about,
I feirit to speik in haist:
Some seirnd assurit, some dred for dout, some ran reid wood almaist:
With wringing, and thringing, his hands on other dang:
Despair to, for cair to, wald needs himself go hang.
Fra time experience persauit, quod he remember ze ressauit, as will alledgit
of laite:
Quhen as he swear nocht else he saw, in age bot anger slack and slaw, and
cankerit of consait:
He culd not luck as he alledgit, that all opinions speirit:
He was sa frak and fyerie edgit, he thocht not to be feirit:
Quha pansis, on chancis, quod he na worschip winnis:
Ay some best, sall come best, that hapweill rakwell rinnis.
Zit quod experience behauld, for all the tales that he hes tauld, how he
himself behaues:
Because despair culd come na speid, luik quhair he hangs all botthe heid, and
in ane withie waves:
Gif thou be sorry thou may see, two men that with them mellis:
Gif they have hurt or help it thee, considder be them selfis:
Than choose ze, to use ze, with us or sic as zone:
Say sone now, have done now, make ather off or one.
Persaues thou not quhairfra proceids, the frantic fantasses that feids. thy
furious flaming fire:
Quhilk dois thy bailfull breist combuir, bot naue bot we (quod they) can cuir,
nor kennis quhat dois require:
The passions of thy pensive spreits, that waists thy fatal breath:
Hes healit thy heavy heart with heits, desire draws on thy death:
Thy punssis, denuncis, all kind of quiet rest:
That fever, hes ever, thy personay oppressed,
Quod they were thou acquaint with skill, he knawis quhat humors dois thee ill,
qubair thou thy cares contraks:
