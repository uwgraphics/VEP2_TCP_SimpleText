The tryumphes of Fraunces Petrarcke, translated out of Italian into English by
Henrye Parker knight, Lord Morley.

The tryumphe Of Love. Of Chastity. Of Death. Of Fame. Of Time. Of Divinity.

I. C.

Unto the most toward young gentle Lord Matrauers, son and heir
apparaunt to the worthy and noble Earl of Arundel, your poor friend Henry
Parker knight, Lord Morley, prays to God that the virtue which does
floryshe in you in this your tender age, may more and more increase in you,
to the comfort of all that love you, unto the last age.
THe fables of Isope (most toward young Lord) are not only had in com
mendation among the Phi losophers, as with Plato, Ari stotle, and diverse
other of ye most excellent of the^: but also the deuines, when in their
preachynges there comes to their purpose any matter, to rehearse to the rude
people, they allege the allegorye sense of them, to the much edification of
the hearers. I say therefore, that among other his wyttye fables (not to you
noble gentleman unknown) he tells, how that the cock scrapynge on a
doungehill, found a precious stone, and when he saw it, disdayninge, he
spurned it from him, saying, what have I to do with the, thou canste not serve
me to no kind of use, and so dispysynge it, left it where as it lay on the
dongehyll still.

Even so there be a number of that sort, that percase when they shall either
hear read, or them self read this excellent tryumphes, of this famous
clercke Petrarcha, shall little set by them, and peradventure cast it from
them, desiring rather to have a tale prynted of Robyn Hoode, or some other
dongehyll matter then of this, which I dare affirm, yea, and the Italians do
the same, that the divine works set aparte, there was never in any vulgar
speech or language, so notable a work, so clerckely done as this his work.
And albeit that he sets forth these syxte wonderful made triumphs all to
the laud of his Lady Laura, by whom he made so many a sweet sonnet, that
never yet no poet nor gentleman could amend, nor make the like, yet who that
does understand them, shall se in them comprehended al moral virtue, all
Phylosophye, all storyall matters, and briefly many deuyne sentences
theological secrets declared. But alas who is he that will so read them,
that he will mark them, or what prynter will not say, that he may win more
gain in pryntynge of a merye ieste, then such like excellent works, suerlye
(my good Lord) very few or none, which I do lamente at my heart,
considering that as well in French, as in the Italyan (in the which both
tongues I have some little knowledge) there is no excellent work in the latin,
but that straight ways they set it forth in the vulgar, most commonly to
their kings and noble princes of their region and countries: As one of late
days that was grome of the chaumber with that renowned and valyaunte Prince of
high memory, Fraunces the French king, whose name I have forgotten, that
did translate these tryumphes to that said king, which he took so
thankefully, that he gave to him for his pains an hundred crounes, to him and
to his heirs of inheritance to enjoy to that value in land for ever, and
took such pleasure in it, that wheresoever he went among his precious
Iewelles, that book was always carried with him for his pastyme to look upon,
and as much esteemed by him, as the rychest Diamonde he had: which said
book, when I saw the coppye of it, I thought in my mind, how I being an
English man, might do as well as the French man, did translate this said
work into our maternall tongue, and after much debatyng with my self, did as
your Lordshyppe does se, translate the said book to that most worthy king
our late soueraygne Lord of perpetual memory king Henrye theyghte, who as
he was a Prince above all other most excellent, so took he the work very
thankefullye, merueylynge much how I could do it, and thinking verelye I
had not done it, without help of some other, better knowing the Italyan
tongue then I: but when he knew the very treweth, that I had traunslated
the work my self, he was more pleased therewith then he was before, and so
what his highness did with it, is to me unknown, one thing is, that I did it
in such have, that doubtless in many places (if it were again in my hands) I
think I could well amend it, albeit that I profess, I have not erred much
from the letter, but in the ryme, which is not possible for me to follow in the
translation, nor touch the least point of the elegancy that this elegant Poet
has set forth in his own maternall tongue. But as it is, if in the
translation there be any thing to be amended, or any will deprave it, I
shall, pray you (most noble young Lord) the very myrroure of all the young
noble gentelmen of this realm in virtue, in learning, and in all other feats
appertayning to such a Lord as you be, to defend it aagaynst those that will
more by envy the^ by know ledge deprave it, and then I do not fear but those
that know and can speak the Italian, will bear with the simple translation,
and commend the work, as it is so much commendable, that it can not be to
dear bought, I desire god noble young gentleman, to make the lord Matrauers an
old gentleman, and then thy worthy father the Earl of Arundell my most
special good Lord and friend, shall make an old Earl and live vsque in
senium et senectum.

Dixi Henry Morelye.

The first Chapter of the Tryumphe of Love.
IN the time of the Renewinge of my suspyres
By the sweet remembrance of my lovely desires
That was the beginning of so long a pain
The fair Phoebus the bull did attain
And warmyd had the tone and the other horn
Whereby the cold winter storms were worn
And Tytans child with her frostye face
Ran from the heat to her aunciente place
Love, grefe, and complaynt, out of reason
Had brought me in such a case that season
That mine eyes closed, and I fell to rest
The very Remedy to such as be oppreste
And there on the grene, as I reposed fast
Suddenly me thought, as I mine eyes up cast
I saw before me a marvelous great light
wherein as well comprehend then, I might
Was doloure enough with small sport and play
And thus in my dream musyng, as I lay
I saw a great Duke victorious to behold
Tryumphyng on a chair, shynyng as gold
Much after the old ancient sage wise
That the bold Romans used in there guyse
When to the Capytoll the vyctors were brought
With right rich Robes curiously were wrought
I that such sightes was not wont to se
In this noyous world wherein I find me
Uoyde from the old valor and yet more in pride
Saw coming toward me there on every side
Diverse men with strange and queynte arraye
Not vsyd among us at this present day
Which made me wonder what persons theishuld be
As one glad to learn, and some new things to se
There saw I a boy on a firye chair on hyghte
Drawn with four coursers all milk whight
With bow in hand and arrows sharp and keen
Against whom no shylde nor helm so sheene
Might in no wise the mortale stroke wythstand
When he shote with his most dreadful hand
To this also a strange sight to se
Two wings upon his shoulders had he
with colors more then I can write or tell
A thousand diverse this I noted well
And all the rest were nakyd to the skin
About the chair where that this boy was in
Some lay there dead gapynge on the ground
Some with his darts had taken meny a wound
Some were prisoners and could not escape away
But followed still the chair night and day
I that saw this wonderful strange sight
To know what it mente, did that I might
Till at the last I did perceive and se
My self to be among that company
So had love led me on that dawnce
That as it lyked her, so must I take the chawnce
I then among that great number in that place
Lokyng here and there in each man's face
If any of mine Acquayntaunce I could se
But none was there except perchance that he
By age or death or pain was changed quyte
As that I never had him known by sight
With following that great king in that hour
That is the ground and cause of all dolowre
Thus all astonished as I looked here and there
All suddenly before me then did there appear
A shadow much more sad for to regard
Than all the rest that I had seen or hard
This said shadow called me by name
And said by love is gotten all this fame
Whereat I marueyled and said to him again
How know thou me, to learn I would be feign
For who thou art I do not know at all
So wondrous derke is here this air and all
That I can nether perceive nor yet well se
What man thou art nor whence yt thou should be
To that anon this shadow to me said
I am thy friend thou nedest not be dismayde
And borne in Toscane where you was borne perdye
Thine ancient friend if that thou list to se
His words which that I knew by days paste
By his speech, I knew him at the last
All though his face, I could not then well se
And thus in talkyng together went we
And he began and thus to me did say
It is right long and thereto many a day
That I have looked the my frynde to se
Among us here in this our company
For thy face was to me a token plain
That ones thou should know loves pain
To whom I made answer and said
These words by me they cannot be denayde
But the sorrow the danger and the dread
That lovers have at the end for their meade
So put me in fear, that I left all aside
Lest that my service should be clean denyde
Thus said I and when he well perceived
Mine entention and my words conceived
Smiling he said what flame of fire
Has love kyndled in thy hartys desire
I understood then little what he meant
For his words unto my head then went
As fyrme and fast sure set anon
As they had been prynted in a marbell stone
And thus for the new game that I begane
I prayde him tell me of very gentleness than
What people these were that before me went
He answered bryfely to mine intent
That I should know what they should be
And be shortly one of their company
And that it was my destany and lotte
That love should tie for me such a knotte
That I should first change my head to graye
Or that I could unclose that knot away
But to fulfill thy young desire says he
I shall declare what kind of men they be
And first of the capteynes of them all
His manner plain declare the I shall
This is he that love the world does name
Bitter as thou shall well conceive the same
And much the more when the time shall be
That thou shall be among this company
A meke child in his lustye young age
And in elde one all full of rage
Well knows he that this has prouyd
When thou by him art heaued and shoued
Thy self shall well see and understand
What a master thou have then in hand
This god has his first birth of ydelnes
Noryshed with mankyndes folly and wantones
And of vain thoughts plesaunt and sweet
To a sage wise man nothing mete
Called a god of the people most vain
All be it he gives for their reward and pain
Some the death forthwyth out of hand
Some alonge time in miserye to stand
To love I say them that loves not him
Fast tied and fetred both cheke and chynne
Now have I declared to the this gods feste
Now will. I tell the in order of the rest
Him that thou see that so lordely does go
And leads with him his love also
It is the valeaunte Caesar, Julius
With him is queen Cleopatra the beutiouse
She tryumphes of him and that is good right
That he that overcame the world by might
Should himself over commen be
By his love even as thou may se
The next unto him is his son dear
The great Augustus that never had pear
That louyde more justly then Caesar plain
By request his Lynya he did obtain
The third is the dyspytefull tyraunte Nero
That furyously as thou see does go
And yet a woman him overcame
With her regardes Lo she made him tame
Behold the same, is the good Marcus
Worthy to have praise for his life virtuous
Full of philosophy both the tongue and breast
Yet for Fausteyn he stands as arreste
The the other two that stand him by.
That look both twain so fearefullye
The tone is Denyse the the other Alexander
That well was rewarded for his s^^aunder
The the other was he that soore complained
Under Autander with tears unfeigned
The death of Crensa and took away
The love from him as the poet does say
That took from Enander his sone dear
Among the rest thou may se him here
Have thou hard ever reason heretofore
Of one that never would consent more
To his stepmothers foull and shameful desires
But fly from her sight and her attyres
But woe alas that same chaste honest mind
Was his death as thou may plainly find
Because she changed her love unto hate
Phedra she hight that caused the debate
And yet was it her own Death also
A sore punishment unto both them two
To the sens that deceived Adryan
Wherefore it is full often found than
That one that blames another parde
He him self is more to blame then he
And who so he be wythouten any doubt
That by fraud or craft does go about
Another that trusts him for to beguyle
Yt is good reason that with that self wyle
He be served with that same sawse
Lo what it is a lover to be false,
This is he the famous worthy knight
That betwyxt two systers stands vpryghte
The tone by him was cruelly slain
The the other his love in joy did remain:
He that goes with him in the route
It is Hercules, the strong, fierce, and stout
That love caused to follow her dance:
The the other which in loving had hard chance
It is Achylles the Greek so bold
That for Polexemes love dyed, as it is told.
There may thou see also Demophone
And Phylys his love, that sore did moan
His absence, whereby that she dyed.
Lo those that stand upon the the other side
Is Jason, and Medea that for his love
Deceived her father his truth to prove
The more ungentle is Jason in deed
That gave her such reward for her mede.
Hysyphyle follows and she does wayle also
For the barbarouse love was taken her fro
Next in order there comes by and by
He that has the name most excellently
Of bewtye, and with him comes she
that ouersone beheld his beutye
Whereby ensued innumerable of harms
Thoroughe out the world by Mars charms
Behold I pray the among the company
Enone complaining full heauely
For Paris that did her falsely betraye
And took in her stead fair Helen awape
Se also Menelaus the Grekysse king
For his wife Helene in great mourning
And Hermon the fair Horestes for to call
And Laodome that stands all apall
Cry for her love the good Protheossolaus
And Irgia the faithful for Pollynisus
Here I pray the, the grievous lamentynges
The syghes, the sorrows, and the bewaylynges
Of the miserable lovers in this place
That are brought into so dolorous case
That there spyrytes they are about to render
Unto the false God that is so sclendre
I can not now tell the all the names
That the false God of love thus tames
Not only men that borne be mortal
But also the high great Gods supernall
Are here in this great and dark press
What should I any more now rehearse
Se where Uenus does stand with Mars
Whose head and legs the iron does enbrase
And Pluto and Preserpyne on the other side
And Juno the ielyous for all her pride
And Apollo with his gaye golden locks
That gave unto Uenus scorns and mockes
yet in Thessalia with this boys fyrye darte
This great God was pearsed to the heart
And for conclusion, the Gods and Goddesses al
Of whom Uarro does make rehearsal
Behold how before loues'chayre they goo
Fast fettred and chayned from top to too
And Jupiter him self, the great mighty king
Among the other, which is a marvelous thing.
The second Chapter of the Tryumphe of Love.
ALl musing with great admiration
As one astonnyed to see the fasshyon
Now here, now there, I looked all about
To se the order of this great huge route
And as my heart from thought to thought past
I saw twain together at a cast
Hand in hand they went in the prease
Reasonynge together they did not sease.
Their strange habyte, and their array
And their language more strange I say
Was unto me so dark and obscure
That what they meant I know not be ye sure.
Till my fellow by his interpretation
Of that which they talked made declaration
And then when I knew what they were
Into their presence I drew me nere
And perceived that the one spirit was
Friend to the Romans that there did pass
The to there contrary a perpetual foo
I left her then, and to the the other did goo
and said: O Masinissa I the pray
For Scypyons sake which thou dydst love always
And for Sophonysba that stands the by
That I am so bold be thou not angrye
To demand the what thou do here
Masinissa answered with a sad chere
I do desire to know what thou should be
For it is I tell the a great wonder unto me
That thou do spy my great affection
which that I be are with such dilection
To this my love, and to my the other friend
That desire of me, and I will condescende
To all that thing that thou wylt have me do
I answered gently, O high prince not so
My poor estate desires no such mede
A small little fire far of in deed
Brings forth but a small light:
But thy royal fame, O noble knight
Is every where blown and spredde
This duke before whom thou art led
I pray the gently king express
Whether he does led you both in peace
You and Sophonysba, for I suppose
That twain such lovers as together goese
In all the world were hard to find:
He answered and said, thy words are so kind
That although thou know hole the case
Of all my love how grievous that it was
Yet will I tell the thy fancy to appease
And thy mind to set at rest and ease,
That noble Duke that only had my heart
So true and sure, and fast in every part
That I in frendshyp with Lelins may compare
Whersoeuer his worthy baner did fare,
There was I, with that most worthy knight
But not so fortunate as he deserved by right
For full of goodness and grace was he
As Well with soul as in the fair body
Now after the Romans by singler honor
Had sprede their arms by might and power
To the extreme parts of the occident
Thither with this valeaunt Scipion I went
There was I, in love first taken than
With this Sophonisba this sweet woman
And she with me in such a fervent guyse
That I affirm and with so true advise
That never two lovers loved better
Nor two true loving hearts nor sweter
Agreade in one nor yet never shall
But the time of during alas it was but small
For sone vanished away our lovely chere
As I tell the if that thou will me here
For albeit, I took her to my wife
And thought with her to have led my lyffe
The bond was broken forthwith in twain
By his holy words that more might certain
Then all the world in such faruente case
The knot he losed and I my self gave place
And now wonder for I in him did see
So high virtue in all kind of degree
That as I may say by good comparison
He is all blind that cannot see the son
And albeit that justice was offense
To our true love yet his high prudence
And his dear frendshyppe did me compel
For to folo we his sage worthy council
In honor a very father was he
And in love a child in yche degree
A brother in years which me constrained
With heavy heart with sighs deep payned
Scipio to obey whereby my wife
Was constrained for to lose her life
And that wyllingly rather then she
Into vile servitude brought should be
And I my self the mynister was
To my great doloure to execute this case
So ardently she desired the death
That I my self as the truth says
To her prayer did then condescend
To my great heaviness this was the end
I sent her venyme for to drink
With such a sorrow as thou may think
Y fever thou feltes of loves woo and pain
That it seems my heart would breast in twain
She knows this and so well know I
Be thou the Judge and thynk I do not lie
Thus lost I my dear hope and lust
To keep my faith and not to be unjust
Unto my Scipio now seek if thou may
If thou caust se in all this great arraye
Or else perceive in all this lovers dance
So wonderful and so strange a chance
With these words that he declared to me
Calling to mind as I might plainly se
The hoote fyery love betwixt them twain
My heart even there so relentyde plain
As does the snow against the fervent son
When that his beams to sprede he has begone
And this as these twain passed by
I hard her say and that right hastily
This fellow pleased me nothing at all
I am determined ye and ever shall
To hate him and all his nation
When that I hard her speak of this facion
I said Sophonisba I pray the be in peace
For bryfelye the truth to the to rehearse
Two times the Romans thy cartage oppressed
That as their subjects to be they all confessed
The third time they destroyde it clean
That now uneath thereof is nothing seen
Sophonisba answered to me again
With short words and in great disdain
If Aufrike wept Italy had no need
For to make bost of their lucky speed
Ask those that your hystoryes do write
For they the truth of both perties do endite
Thus they went both together in fere
Among the great prease here and there
Smiling and talkyng that I ne might
No more of them have after that a sight
Then as one that at adventure does ride
To know the right way on every side
Now stands, now goes, now hyeth a pase
Even so my fancye at that time it was
Doubtefull and desyring to know by prove
How faruently these twain did love
Till at the last as I cast mine eye
Upon the lift hand I saw me by
One that had this strange effect
To seem angry because he did abiecte
His wyffe which he loved above all other
By pytie to give her to a another
And reioysed much so for to do
And all together as lovers they did goo
Talking of this merueylouse case
And of Syrya that country where it was
I drue me nere to these spirits three
That were about, as far as I can see
To have gone from thense another way
And to the first of them thus did I say
I pray you said I, a while for to abide
A none the first he did cast his head aside
When that he hard me speak Italyan
And with a right angrye countenance than
He stood still and straight began to tell
That which I thought to be a great marvel
Thou desyrest my friend to know says he
What I am and what that I should be
I am Selencus brifely to discus
And this before the is my son Antiocus
Which had great war with ye Romans nation
But right against fierce has no dominion
This woman that thou sest was first my wife
And after was his for to save his life
It was then ^efull for us so to do
Her name is Stratonica she was called so
And our chance by love was thus divided
And under this facyon the matter was guyded
My son was contented to release to my hand
His great kingdom and all his large land
I unto him my love and lady dear
When that I saw him for to chaung his chere
And day by day to draw unto the death
So that uneath he might not draw his breath.
I maruayled much what the cause should be
Secretly my wife for truth loved he
That not disclosinge his woeful pain
My dear son by love was well nere slain
And had been dead, but that the wise phisician
Disclosed to me the very cause than
Of all his sycknes which he kept close
Surely this came of a virtuous purpose
And of a wondrous fatherly pytie of me
Saying these words away went he
So that I could uneath bydde him farewell
And this was all that then he did me tell
After that the shadow thus was gone
Syghynge and sad, I made great moan
Because I might not to him disclose my heart
But still as I stood thus musing aparte
I know that Zerzes the great king of Perce
Which led an Army as hystories reherce
Of men innumerable, had never such a sort
As there was of lovers barrayne of comfort
So that mine eyes could not well suffyse
To se their strange fashyons and their guyse
Uaryable of tounges, and of so diverse lands
That among a thousand one that there stands
I knew not, their person nor their name
Nor yet in hystorye could descryue the same
Parseus was one, and feign I would desire
How Andromeda did her self so attire
That although she black were pardie
Borne in Ethiope that whote country
yet her fair eyne, and her cryspe hear
This Parseus heart in love so did steare
That as his love the virgyn did he take
And never after did that maid forsake
There was also the folysh lover plain
That loved his own pycter vain
That thereby unwisely he was brought to death
And after as the hystorye plainly says
He was converted by the divine power
Unto a fair goodly pleasant flower
Without for to bring any fruit at all
And by him among these lovers thrall
Was she that was turned unto a stone
And now aloude does answer every one
When she is called with voice clear
Next unto this Ecco that did appear
Was yphys that had her self in hate
With other diverse, in a full pyteouse state
Which were to long their names for to rehearse
Either in prose, or else in ryme or verse
But yet of some I will declare and tell
Of Alcione and Ceice that loved so well
That love they had so joined for ever
That nothing could make them to disseuer
Now clepyng now kissing, as they did fly
Searching the kyngedome of Esperye
Now resting together on a salt stone
And by the Sea their nestes to make alone
And I saw also among that great route
As here and there I looked me about
The cruel daughter of king Nysus
With flight she fled which is maruelouse
Allauta was among them in the press
With their gay golden apples doubtless
She was vanquyshed yea and overcome
By Hyppomone lo this is all and some
Glad he seemed to have had the vyctory
And among the other of this company
I saw Atys and Galathea in his lap
And Poliphemon with great noise and clappe
And Glanco shouynge among the sort
Crying for his love without comfort
Carmenite and Pico, of Italy sometime king
Turn to a bird, which was a meruelouse thing
There saw I also Egeria complain
Because Syllayn was turned certain
Into a great hard rock of stone
Which in the sea makes many to moan
Among the other that I have rehearsed
Was Cauase, by her father oppressed
In the tone hand a pen did she hold
A sword in the the other, with pale face and cold
Pygmalion was there among the rest
With his wife Alyf that he loved best
And among these I hard a thousand sing
In Castallia where these Poets bring
These lovers with them more then I rehearse
In prose, in ryme, in meter, and in verse
And at the last Cydippe did I see
Scorned with an apple there was she.
The third chapter of the tryumphe of Love.
SO much was my heart a marueld of this sight
That I stood still as one that had no might
To speak or look but to hold his peace
As desyreous to have some council doubtless
When that my friend gentylly to me said
Why do thou muse? Why art thou dismayde?
Show forth a better chere and port
And se how that I am one of the sort
That will I, nyll I, must follow the rest.
Brother said I, and thou know best
Mine entention, and the hot love I feale
Which is so whote that it cannot keale
So that such busynes does travail my mind
That what I would say I leave behind.
He answered and said, I do hear it all
And well understand by thy memorial
Thou would know yet what these other be
And I shall show thee if thou will hear me
See thou yondre great man of honor
That is Pompeus so great of power
That has with him Cornelia the chaste
Complaining of the vile Tholome the unsteadfast
That betrayed so noble and worthy a man
The the other is the great and myghtie grecian
Alexander the lord of lords all
Egystus and Clytemistra see where they stall
And how by them one may soon find
Love unconstant waueryng and blind
More fast love found she that stands by
Ipermistra it is that fair sweet lady
See also where Piramus does goo
And with him Thisbe that he loved so
That in the derke met often together
Leander in the sea and Ero at the fenester
And him that thou do se so pensyle and sad
It is Ulixes that so chaste a wife had
That did long abide his return from Troy
Now on Cyres he has all his joy
And yonder man that thou do aduerte
That made all ytaly sore for to smerte
It is Amilcar son in very dead
That made all the Romans to fear and dread
And although he made yche man to quake
A vile wench prisoner does him take
And yonder woman with the short hear
Look how she follows here and there
All though she were queen of Ponto
Her husband whersoeuer he does goo
As a servant and not as a wife
She led with him a full hard life
The the other thou see is Porcia the true
The chastiste wife that ever man knew
Because that iron men did her forbyde
The fire she swallowed till she were deed
Behold where is Iulia that soore complained
That she best loved her husband unfeigned
And yet he louide his second wife better
There could to her be no pain greater
Turn thine eyes on the other side
And see the old holy father begylde
And dysdayne not for to take the pain
To serve seven years to have Rachell again
O lively love that with labor does increase
See the father of this Jacob nevertheless
And the graundefather of Sara take delyght
Thus does love with his power and might
After look how love cruel and evil
Overcame Dauide and made him to kill
His faithful servant which he repented sore
In a derke place he did repentance therefore
A like mysty cloud pity to think upon
So ^erkyd the great wisdom of Solomon
That well near it quenched his high fame
Se also I pray the among the same
He that louyde and hatyd in a while
And it is he that Thamar did beguyle
Wherefore she complained to Absolone
Of her mysfortune she made wondre moan
And little before him see there he went
The strong Sampson that sore did repent
For putting his head in his loves lap
Tellyng her his secrets he had hard hap
After behold among swords and spears
Iudeth that hent him by the hears
The proud Holiferne vanquished by love
Whereby she sauyde her city from reprove
There was no moo but she and he maid
That did this wonders act at that abrayde
Do thou not see Sychen before thine eyes
Emonge the circumcysed people how he dies
Scorned in like manner as the the other was
This was love that brought him to that case
Lo where thou may see the great Assuerus
That for to heal his malady amarouse
Left the tone and took him to a sweter
There is no remedy against love better
Then one nail to knock out with a another
A strong example this is among the other
But now wylt thou see in one tyrants heart
Love and cruelty which is a diverse part
Behold Herodes how he does complain
This myscheuouse tyrante inhumayne
To late repentyd so does diverse mo
The dead ones done, it cannot be undo
Maryamne his love he calls and clepeth
And all in vain wherefore he wepeth
And lo there one may behold and see
Three fair sweet Dameselles where they be
Pocry and the good gentle Arthemesia
And in there company there stands Deidamin
These were not so good but the other be as ill
That follows this loves tryumphe still
Semiramis and Biblia, and Mirra, the gent
That of their vile love do soore repent
I am not aduysed their offenses to name
Therefore I leave it for very pure shame
Now follows then that fill books with lies
Launslote and Trystram that for Ysode dies
And Queen Queynor with other lovers moo
But specially the fair gentle Darmino
That made for his love great complaynte
And she for him wexed pale and faynte
Thus spoke my friend, and I which herkened well
All these hystories that he to me did tell
Stood astonished as in dread and fear
Of hurt to come that hastyth nere and nere
Pale and wane as he that is so taken
Out of his tomb new risen and awaken
When that all suddenly by me there stood
The fairest young maiden of face and mode
That ever I saw whyter then a dove
Which unprovided took me soore in love
And although that I did pretend
By strength against her me to defend
And that I, would resyst in the place
A man of arms in such a soden case
Yet for her words and with her smyling there
She bound me fast and took me prisoner
And even then for truth in that degree
My friend drue nere and smyling said to me
In my nere wysperyng now speak thou may
What love is and all her nyce play
Now may thou know it as well as I
Both we be spottyd with one maladye
I than was one of this great arraye
That more did lament the truth, I say
Of other men's love that prosperde well
Then of mine own doloure of which I tell
And as he that repents all to late
Of hurt taken unwisely allgate
So of my loves beauty did I make
Mine own death which wyllyngly I take
By love, by ielozy, by envy also
Burning like fire thus did I love in woo
The fire was kyndled in that most fairest face
Even as a sick man that an appetyte hase
And desires that to him seems sweet
Yet to this health it is nothing mete
Even so was I unto all other pleasure
Deaf and blind, out of all measure
Following her by so doubtful ways
That it to remember, those times and days
I tremble and quake when thereof I do think
More then I can write with pen paper and ynke
So that from the time that this befell
Mine eyes for moisture seemed a well
My heart was pensyfe, my lodginge was in deed
Brokes sprynges, and ryuers, so did I led
My life in busshes, in grouets, and in woods
Among the stones, I sought none other goods
And to this so many papers white
As in her praise I payned to endyte
When after I tore them into pieces small
I was compelled again to write them all
And all in loves cloystre what is done
I know it well it cannot be undone
That there is fear, and there is hope also
Who will it read, and take heed thereto
In my forehead there may ye se it plain
All my sorrow, my doloure, and my pain
And for all this, that wild ioly dame
That is the causer of all this same
Goes before me and cares not at all
Whether that I flete, I synke, or fall
So is she proud in virtue set so hye
That in her self she takes glory
To have me so fast her servant bound
That I know not how to heal my wound
And to this it is a maruelouse thing
The God of love this great mighty king
It seems of her he is soore afearde
When that she list to look hymin the bearde
So that hope does me so often forsake
That love him self no remedy can make
For when he will any thing with this maid
She does not as other do that are afraid
But as one that is free she goes in the race
Not bound, but at lydertie with her fair face
And no wondre for she does appear
Emonge the stars as the Son clear
Her port is synguler her words are marvelous
Her hear spread as the gold most beutiouse
The eyes kyndled with a celestial light
That well content to burn is my delyght
Who can compare with her angelyke demure
It passes my connyng ye may be sure
As much as the Sea passes a little broke
For who on good manners does prye and look
A new thing it is, and not before seen
Nor after shall not so dulse and sheene
So that all tounges her beutye to express
Are and shall be muete doubtelesse
With such a one am I taken, and with her tide
And she free from all love on every side
O wicked star that my destanye does lead
How is it that I have no better speade
Day and night upon her I do call
But she nothing bouse to pytie at all
Nor scant will tarry to hear what I say
Alas for pytye well mourn I may
A hard law it is thus to love be kind
The way not right, but crooked for to find
But yet to follow it why should I say nay
When that not only men does go that way
But the Gods also that be celestial
Are not free from this pain at all
He that is a lover full well knows this
How that the heart from the body departed is
How now he is in war, and forthwith in peace
How when his love does show ungentleness
He will not be aknowen, but his malady hyde
Though that it prycke him both back and side
This evil feel I, and yet more there to
When with my love I have to do
The blood for fear renneth to my heart
And straight abroad in my veins does starte
I know also how hid under the flower
The serpent lies the lover to devour
How always the lover lies in dread and doubt
In great suspecte for to be put out
By another, and so no rest I take
Neither when I sleep, nor when I wake
I know also how to seek the place
Where my love is ay wont to pass
And yet I stand in fear her to find
Although her self is prynted in my mind
I know also my self how to beguyle
With loving and morning a great while
Following the damesell it is even so
That will burn me following, yet after I go
I know moreover how love cries and calls
And will not be shytte out with doors nor walls
But puttes by reason, and will not go away
Till he pearce the heart, and all I say
I know also how s^^^ a gentle heart
Is tied with a small lace and cannot* start
When the senses have the better hand
And reason put by, and will not withstand
I know to this how that love does shote
How he flies and strykes without geuyng boot
How he threateth and robs with forse and might
And thus wrongs his servants against alright
and I am not ignorant how unstable is his whele
The hope doubtful always for to feel
The doloure suit, his promise untrue
Ay desirous to change for things new
And how to this in the bones does rest
The hyd fire that lies so oppressed
In the lovers veins, and that with such a wou^d
That at the last it brings him to the ground
In conclusion I know love so to be
Inconstaunt, waueryng, and fearful trust me
Having in it a little small swetenes
Mengled with extreme pain and bytternes
When he would speak, cannot though he would
Sodeyne scilence when his tale should be told
A short laughing with complaynt still and long
Gall tempred with honey this is the lovers song.
The fourth Chapter of the Tryumphe of Love.
AFter that my fortune thus hade me brought
And love so sore in my heart wroughte
That cut were al my weak sely veins
My liberty gone and I in woeful pains
I that before was wild as any heart
Was made then tame for my part
As well as all the other that were there
And well knew their travail and their fere
And with what wit, craft and chance
I and they were brought to loves dance
And then as that I looked all about
If I might spy among that hudge route
Any person of clear and high name
That by writing have eternal fame
I saw him that Erudyce did call
Upon Pluto the great god infernal
And followed her as these hystories tell
Down unto the deep dongeon of hell
And dying did his love clepe and call
I saw also even among them all
Alceo Macreon and the wise Pyndarus
That in love were all three studiouse
Uyrgyll was there. I say in like case
With other excellent poets in that place
The tone was Ouyde the the other Catullo
Propercius also and eke Tubullo
That of love wrote many a verse and song
And with this excellent Poets among
Was a Grecian that with her sweet style
Of love full many a song did fyle
Ay lokyng thus about me here and there
I saw in a grene field with sad chere
People that of love reasonyng went
Dant with beatryce fair and gent
Lo on the the other side I might also se
Cino of Piscoia with him trust me
Guydo of Rezzo and in that place
Two other Guydos in like manner and case
The tone of them was borne in boleyne
The the other was a very right Cicelien
Senicio and Francisco so gentle-of condition
And Arnolde and Daniell in like facion
A great maker and dyuyser of love
And did great honor to his City above
There was Peter also the Clerk famous
And Rambaldo with his style curiouse
That wrote for his beatryce in mont ferrato
The old Peter and with him Geraldo
Filile to that in Marsill bare the name
And the praise from Geneway by the same
Geffray Rudell that sought his death Alas
upon the water as he himself did pass
There was also Wilbon at that hour
That in writing to his Peramoure
Passyd many other in his days
Among these other that of love says
Was Amerego, Barnardo, Hugo, and Anselme
That instead of spear, shilde, and helm
Was their tongue and their fair speech
The love of their Ladies to beseech
I turned mine eyes from that company
And straight wise I did there espy
The good Thomaso that gate great praise
In Boleyne that city in his dayse
O fleyng swetenes O paynefull weary life
What chance has taken with woo and strife
These my dear fryndes away from me
Why am I not still in their company
Well may I perceive how feeble and frail
Is man's life all full of travail
Well may I say it is none other thing
But as a dream or a shadow passing
Or as a fable that when it is told
The wind and whether does it hold
Unneth was a little past the rule
Of the commen lernars in scole
When first I did Socrates works se
And Lelius how fair they did agree
With these men I entende still to goo
Which I have named hither unto
As those whose laud: no man can well rehearse
Neither in ryme, in prose, nor yet in verse
With these two and diverse other in my days
Have I searched many diverse ways
And from these no man can me deuyde
But for always I will with them abide
Untyll the hour come* that I shall dye
For with these two gotten yet have I
The gloriouse Laurel wherewith my head
As a garlande all about is spredde
In memory of her of which I write
Uerses of praises as I can endyte
But of her which I so much commend
For all my service that I do pretend
I cannot get neither boughe nor lefe
But pain, heaviness, doloure, and grefe
And or I write the cause why she does so
I will write of the pensyfe woo
That these unwise lovers have to love
The thing is so far my wit above
That for great Omer or for wise Orpheus
It were well mete they should it dyscusse
Then in following of my golden pen
I will declare how I and all these men
Following this god by Dykes and by Dales
With peynes and business and with many tales
This child unto his kingdom came
Where Uenus his mother was resydent than
But so ouerwhart thither was the ways
By busshes and woods and other brayes
That not one among all wyste where he was
Nor how it was with him nor in what case
There lies beyond Egeo that great see
A delectable isle to behold and se
Because the son softly does it warm
The birds there full swetely charm
In the mids of this isle now expressed
Is there a mountain fair ydressed
With fair flowers, and fair clear water
That it takes away all sad matter
From the hearts of such as be there
This is the land to Uenus most dear
Wherein the old ancient men
Made to this Uenus a temple then
And yet of virtue it is so barrayne I say
That as it was, so it is at this day
In that self same place tryumpheth this Lord
Of us and other that he does bind in cord
Of all nations, from Tyle unto Inde
Innumerable of all men one may find
This Prince in token of his great victory
That he has obtained of lovers so gloriouslye
Caryeth with him of poor lovers the spoil
To give to his wanton mother in that soil
First of all the lovers thoughts in his lap
He has with him fast closed in a trappe
Uanytie embraseth him, and with him does go
Fugytyue pleasure does follow him also
In winter Roses he caryeth about
In Somer yse, this great God so stout
Doutefull hope before and behind
Short Joy, wauerynge and blind
Penance and sorrow does follow the rest
As in Rome and in Troy, when it was oppressed
Thus with a noise and a huge shoute
Redounded the valleye there all about
With a consent of birds fair and sweet
And the ryuers that ran by the street
Were of color briefly to endyte
Green, blewe, read, yalowe and white
And ever the Ryuars rynnyng in that place
When that the time of great heat was
Upon the fresh fair green flowers
To comfort the herbers and the bowres
Shadows soft to keep the son away
The wether temperate by night and day
The Son nether to hoote nor to cold
Plenty of deynties eat who would
And pleasures diverse to make a simple wit
Have an old feeble heart for to use it
It was about the Equinoctial line than
When the fair bright Phoebus began
To chase the long winter nyghtes away
And prougne laughes early before day
In that time and in that self hour
This great God of so high power
Would tryumphe then, and there worshipped be
O our unstable fortune for to se
We ne could but as this God us lead
Him to worship, se how we speade
What death, what sorrow, woo and pain
Has the lover, his purpose to attain
Now for to declare this matter by and by
This Gods chair, where that they sat on hye
There was about it error and dreams
And glosynge images of all nations and realms
False opynion was entering the gate
And slypper hope stood by their ate
Weary rest, and rest with woe and pain
The more higher he clam the less he did obtayn
Damnable lucre was not wantynge there
Nor profitable hurt always in fere
Clear dishonor, and glory obscure and dark
False lealtie left not there to warke
Nor beguyldynge faith, nor furious busynes
Nor slow reason lacked not in the press
A prison open, enter who would
When he was in gotten out he ne could
Within trouble, confusion, and mysery
A sure sorrow a mirth vncertaynly
Lyppary nor Ischa, nor Uolcan boyls not so
Strongile and Mongebell put thereto
As boiled the place where the castle was
And briefly whosoever thither did pas
Is there bound in hot and in cold
In darkness everlasting in that hold
Holden and tied and kept by forse
Crying for mercy till that he be horse
In this castle syghynge for Sorga and Arno
Was I prisoner many a long day so
That by my wit, I could no means find
Out for to get there I was so blind
One remedy at the least there I found
Whiles that I was in love thus bound
My wit on high things was evermore set
To know what love is which was so great
That I thereby could well discern
What was to be done in such harm
And thus having great compassion
Of such that were in loves prison
My heart relented even as does the snow
Against the hoote Son ye may me trow
Merueylynge to se so many noble men
To be in so dark a prison there and then
None otherwise but as one that does se
A pycture well made in conformyte
Goes the foot forward it for to espy
And yet looks backwarde with his eye
So at that time I looked all about
To consydre this great company and route.
The end of the Tryumphe of Love.
The excellent Tryumphe of Chastity.
WHen that I saw even before my face
In one time and in one Self place
The high god that reigns above
And men mortal subdewede also by love
By their example and by there great ^all
Some profit to my self then did I call
And some comeforte it was also to me
Even as other were I for to be
When Phoebus a god was taken in that lure
And the young Leader a man pure
Both twain strycken with loves darte
And Juno and Dydo lasyd with that part
Not that Dydo that men does write
That for Eneas with death was dyte
But that noble Lady true and just
For Sychen her joy and hearts lust
I ought not to morn though that unware
I were taken in loves crafty snare
Being but a very young man of age
For to be vanquished with such a rage
And if that my Lady that I love best
Will not with love in no wise be oppressed
But be mine enemies in such a thing
I have no cause of great mournyng
For as much as I do call to mind
What hurt by that, that she should find
I know also that by her reason
She does so guide her in each season
That love by her is so abatyd
That it does seem this god is hatyd
Which when that love did plainly se
He was so chafed trust ye well me
That the lyghtnyng that falls from the sky
And beryth down all even by and by
Nor the lion so wood in his rage
So assayde not that time for to assuage
With all his arguments that he could make
This Lady I reason of prisoner to take
Nor she again I say for her part
When that she well and wisely did aduert
What Cupyde was about with her to do
The whurling wind flies not so fast so
As she against him with virtue went
Tolet this great god of his intent
What should I say Etna that hill
That boyleth and burns evermore still
Makes not a more terrible soune
When that Enchelado would shake it down
Nor Sylla nor Carrybdys when angry they be
Then love assayde you may trust me
To wine my Lady in such wise
When that he saw her love despise
Each man there drue himself aparte
The great horrible strife for to aduert
Up to a place that were meruelously hye
To look to, what end this should apply
This god that the vanquer as is told
Of mortal men both of young and old
Took in his right hand Arrowe sharp and kene
And in the the other a bow bright and shene
And drew it up this Lady to fear
In great have and anger up to his ear
And this did he in such great violence
That a Leoparde that makes pretense
The fugytyfe heart for to cache and take
Could not more hasty haste make
Then love did with his fyery face
This fair Lady with craft to compase
I that saw the manner and the guyse
Was soore moved in double wise
Pity ferde me lest that I should se
So sweet a Creature vanquished for to be
Desire again would have be glad
That I my purpose might then have had
But virtue that with the good is ever
Showed at that time that he did never
Forsake him that him does trust
This fair Lady my hearts lust
When she did se the stroke at hand
Was never master that does withstand
In the ship on the parlouse Rock to fall
Then she that then and forth with all
Did away from loves stroke glyde
With such a honesty one every part and side
Which then apperyd in her sweet face
That loves fyery darte had there no place
I that stood still with wonderouse sad intent
To se where unto this matter went
Hopyng the vyctorie to me should fall
And that I should he hyrse hole and all
As one that has or he would speak
Written in his head and heart eke
What he would say even so do I
Think to say even by and by
My lord if that you win the fyelde
Bind me with her for I do yield
And let me never from her depart
Whiles that the life is in my heart
And if that unworthy that I be
To be with this Lady in company
All though for ever in love I dure
Here still with you do tie me sure
Whiles that I minded thus for to say
She looked on me that most sweet may
With such a grave and a wise sad chere
That for to speak it I dread and fear
For I not only that have small wit
But that man also for to declare it
That had the most excellent wit and reason
Should have marueyled at that time and season
For this loves golden and fyery shafte
Even by it self there it fell aparte
Seeing the honesty as I have here told
In my loves breast that then was cold
So that Camilla that fair lady gent
That with the lift breast to battle went
Nor Caesar in Tessalia against Pompeus
Was nothing to speak of so Ualerouse
As she was against love there and than
That every strong shield break it can
Armed was she with all her route
With virtues compassed all about
O what a gloryouse band there was
That against love with her did pass
Twain and twain and hand in hand
This noble army together did stand
Honesty and shamefastness they went before
A great gift of God for evermore
That made this Lady for to show and shine
Not like no mortal but like deuyne
Wit and sobernes followed the trace
Well set in her heart without arrace
And perseueraunce came with the rest
Which kept her honor not to be oppressed
Fair entreatynge was not behind
Nor clemesse nor curtesy that is so kind
Purytie of heart and fear of shame
Was there in presence love to tame
Old wise thoughts in a young tender age
And gratiouse concord all fury to assuage
And beuty lacked not, with a chaste clean thought
All these against love my Lady brought
With the favor of heaven that halpe thereto
And the blessed holy saynetes aid also
That uneath my sight could well sustain
To se such a company in that plain
There saw I this fellowship take the spoil
A thousand palms in that great soil
Away from the hands of them that were
Lovers in that company there and there
The sodeyne throw that fierce Hannibal
Had of Scipion the captain general
Of the Romans when he had obtained
So many victories so many mayned
Nor the great Golyas was not more abashed
When with the stone his head was dashed
By David young and tender of age
Nor Cirus more astonished in that rage
When that the wydow the vengeance did make
For the death of Hermon, and for her loves sake
As was love which stood in the place
Much like after the fashion and case
As he that thynkes himself safe and sound
And with a pange does fall to the ground
Even so there did love poorly stand
Unto his eyes putting up his hand
As he that both with anger and fear
Even with a moment appeared there
And he so chaufed with his adventure
That the ragyouse Sea ye may be well sure
Nor Mongebello nor yet Enchelydo
Never more chaufed then he did tho
Thus passed this great company gloryouse
That I did se tryumphynge thus
But their excellency for to declare
My counynge and my wit is all to bare
I therefore will turn to my fair Lady
And to the rest of her chaste company
She had this excellent dame victoriouse
A white vesture, gaye and gloryouse
The shield in hand of pure Jasper clean
That evil saw Medusa that Queen
With a pyller in the mids fynely set
A chain with a Dyamount thereto was fret
And a Thopasion a preciouse stone
Used sometime and now clean gone
I saw her there even before mine eyes
So bind love in such a wonderouse wise
That it seemed vengeance I say ynowe
To make him stoop, to make him for to bow
And I therefore did nothing then repent
What my love did, I was therewith content
What more should I now say or write
It passes my connyng, it passes my might
The sacred and holy virgins to tell
Caliope and Clio I know it well
With the rest of the muses nine
Should lack eloquence that to defyne
But part of them of most high honest
I will declare what persons they should be
Lucrecia on the right hand there she stood
And sweet Penolope so mylde of mode
These twain had broken in pecis small
Loves bow his darts, arrows and all
And pulled his wings quyte from his back
Thus this great God did go to wrack
Uirginea with her fierce father was there
With swearde in hand and armed clear
That changed the state of Rome town
And raised up liberty that was put down
And after that one might behold and se
Of the Germaynes maidens a huge company
That for to save them from vyllany
Were all contented with good will to dye
Judith the Ebrewe the wise and the strong
With the Greeks Lady she was among
That leped into the great perylious See
To keep her body from all vyllanye
With these sweet sort I saw diverse moo
That in this tryumphe forth did goo
Tryumphynge of Love that tryumphed before
Yet among other there saw I more
The meke vyrgyn of Uesca there she was
That proved her chastity by such a case
She bare fair water in a large Seue
Whereby she voyded all and ill repreue
Hersilia also passed with that route
With all her Sabyns that stood there about
And among these other fair Ladies free
I saw her of much high state and degree
That for her husband was content to dye
And not for Eneas so affirm I
Let the vulgar people then hold their peace
It is that Dydo that I do here rehearse
That honest love brought unto an end
And not vain wanton love that did her offend
At the last I did se one of that land
Where as the large river of Arno does stand
Closed her self up in a secret place
To keep her vyrgynitie, but woo alas alas
Her fair thought by force it was let
There emonge other I saw her set
This excellent tryumphe whereof I write
Went with great glory even forth right
To Baia the seasone all soft and fair
To the place sometime that Sibilla did repair
Called Cumana by her surname
And from thens passing by the same
Straight to Linterna that castle they went
In that small city where it is bent
Dwelled that vallyaunt Romayne than
That was surnamed Scipion the Affrican
There the tone salutyd gently the the other
And evermore among the one and the other
Not she that was fairest but chastyst and best
Was most honored among all the rest
It pleased then this Romayne for to goo
Among the other there in order also
Unto the temple that Sulpicia made
Where all the hole flame that love hade
They quenched it out and from thense all went
Unto that fair temple with good intent
Of honorable chastity so is the right name
Because there appertains unto the same
To kyndle good will in a gentle heart
Speciaily to noblenes that thereto does aduert
In that holy temple there offered this Lady
The gloriouse spoil of her high victory
And leaves of the Laurel tree there did she spread
Of her fresh garlande about her fair head
There the young lover the Toscan left aside
The wound that was both large and side
That love had given him and all because
To fle the suspect to follow loves laws
Where as was with him diverse other mo
The gentle and faithful true Ypolito
And Iosephe the Ebrue honest and just
That vanquisshed love and all his foul lust
The Tryumphe of the excellent Poet Fraunces Petrarcha, of fearful death
most elegantlye written, ye that read it, remember it.
THis most noble and most gloryouse Lady
That now is a spi rite and in the earth does lie
And sometime was the high pyller of valor
Turned from her war with laud and honor
Glad to have over comen an enemy so great
That with his wit turns all men under feet
With none other armor she did this dead
But with a chaste heart at the time of need
With a sweet face and with a clean thought
And with an honest speech this has she wrought
It was a new wondre for to behold and se
Love to be overcome in such wise and degree
His bow broken his arrows cast aside
That slain had so many men of pride
And taken prisoners infinite of men
This noble Lady with her company then
Turned (as said is) from that high victory
All together going under a fair canapye
There was but few no meruayl at all
Uertuous glory is rath and ever shall
But those that were present in that place
Each one by them selves it is a plain case
Seemed well worthy of laud to rehearse
Of Poet or Orator in prose or verse,
Her vyctoriouse standerde was this
In a green field a white armyne is
With a chain of gold about his neck
A fair Topazion thereto did it deck
Nothing after mortal men's rate
Was nether their speech nor yet their gate
But all deuyne for to behold and se
Happy are those that have such destanye
They seemed all fair bright stars
The Son in the mids that not debarres
The light away, but gives them light
Having on their fair heads on hight
Rose garlandes and vyolets fresh and gay
And as a loving gentle heart always
Gets honor for his virtuous life
So past this company without debate or strife
When that all suddenly there did appear
A sad black baner that approached nere
And a woman wrapped all in black
With such a fury and with such a wrack.
That uneath I cannot the truth tell
In the time of the great mighty gyauntes fell
Were any so lothesome for to behold and see
Unto this Lady so ghastly moved he
And said O sweet and excellent maid
That go here most perfytely arayde
With youth and beautye and doste not se
The term that I shall present arrest the
I am the same importune cruel best
Called death fearful that does arrest
All creatures with my great force and might
Or the day end^ making it the night
It is I that has quite and clean wastyd
The great greeks nation and also hastyd
The noble Troyans unto their declyne
And last of all has made to end and fine
The Romans glory with this blade kene
That prycketh and cutteth all away clean
And infinite of other barbarouse nations
Using evermore these ways and facions
When that they look not for me at all
With sodeyne stroke I make them down to fall
A thousand thoughts of men frail and vain
I have broken this is true and certain
And now to you when life seems best
Here am I comen your body to arrest
Or any hard fortune to you chance to fall
I will you take and end not one but all
This excellent Lady having no pear
In all the world with sad and wise chere
Answered unto death there present again
In these chaste companyes this is true and plain
Thou have no reason nor yet no power
And less of all other in me at this hour
Only the spoil that thou shall have
It is my chaste body unto the grave
That well knows one as well as I
That take well my death most heauely
His life on my health all does depend
But unto the this is thy small end
It shall be to me no displeasure at all
To depart the frail world lo this is all
This cruel beast with her wise reason
Was no less marueld at that time and season
Than one that does a thing in soden haste
And when the deed is so done and paste
Does blame him self of that that he has done
Even so did this terrible monster soon
And when he had him self paused a while
With a more soft speech, and gentle style
Thou (says he) that present here do guide
This fair chaste band on every side
That have not yet my fearful stroke assayde
By my council be not so sore afraid
For that I will now do is for the best
To make the fle (O maid) from age oppressed
Which has always longing thereunto
Much grief and dolor with pain and long woe
And to this now present, disposed I am
Thou fair creature and sweet woman
To do the such honor present in this place
That thy spirit shall from the body pass
Without fear, dolor, or grief at all
Be of good comfort O may de, I have said all
This Angelyke creature when she had hard
What death had said, again aunswerd
As it pleases Christ our Lord almyghtye
That rules and tempereth all things eternally
Do thou unto her as thou do to all men
Thus this fair Lady answered there and then
And lo even there present all suddenly
Full of dead bodies their great place did lie
In such a number that them for to rehearse
It cannot be countyd in prose nor yet in verse
Of Cateya of Marow of Spain and Inde
Innumerable dead of all mankind
There were those that men happy did call
Kings Emperors and Bysshoppes all
Now be they poor as poor as beggars be stones
Where is there riches and honor trow ye
Their scepters their crowns with their preciouse
Their myters of purple dected for the noones
Gone is all their glory and their fresh lust
A fool is he that to such things does trust
But those that will needs hope thereunto
At length shall se the matter to be so
Them selves utterly scornyd and beguyled
When all their fancys shall be quyte exiled
O blind fools even worse then mad
For all the pleasures and ioyse ye have had
To your old mother ye must needs pass
And your names forgotten and turned to was
What profit has it then been unto you
With sword and blood strong nations to subdue
To mucke up treasure and your souls to defyle
It had been better to have lived a while
Porely in this world with browe^ bread and water
But now will I return again to my matter
I say than when the extreme hour was come
Of this fair Lady this is all and some
And that she must the doubtful pass assay
That puttes all the world in dread and fraye
There came to se her of women many one
To know and se or that the life were gone
What pain the fair Creature did abide
Both fryndes and Neybors diverse on each side
And so as they her great beauty did behold
Death dissolved the fair here of gold
And so the fairest flower that ever was
He did root up Alas I say Alas
Not for no hate that he to her then had
But in heaven for to make her spirit glad
O how many complayntes and bewaylinges
Syghes and tears and other lamentinges
Were there than among the women all
When that, that fair bright eyes celestial
For which many a sweet song I made
Many a sonete many a fresh balade
Were closed and shot up Alas O woe is me
This fair Creature what trow ye then did she
Sit still and glade in quiet and pease
And gether the fructe of her vertuousnesse
Go thy ways O dear gods well content
In peace and quiet with all thy virtues excellent
But little it auayled against deaths might
Then if he have against such a one right
What shall it be trow ye of the rest
O humayne hope with all mysery oppressed
In a few myghtes so sweet a maid
Goone and past in so short a brayde
So many tears for her death sprede
Thou that seste it or heryst it read
Think what it is the world for to trust
When such a creature is turned unto dust
It was for truth the six day of Apryll
That love to love her did me compel
And even that same self hour and day
Death did take my love and joy away
And now as fortune is wont for to change
Has broken the knot and eke the raunge
With such sorrow unto my woeful heart
That I am afraid I say, as for my part
To tell it either in verse or in ryme
It was to me so sorrowful a time
Virtue said they that were present there
Excellent beutye and most womanly chere
Now is dead and gone what shall we be
When she is past the death as we do se
Where shall her peer or like be seen again
So great perfection in one for to remain
So sweet a speech so Angelyke a voice
This above all other was the choice
And the spyryt when it should depart
As they might se and periytly aduerte
With all other virtues gatheredin one
Where as it went the air most bryghtly shone
None evil adversary was so hardy there
Before her presence to stand or appear
With foul semblaunt to put her in dread
Till death his assaute had done in deed
But after that when all the fear was past
And by disperation they sure at the last
Each one did behold that most sweet face
How preciouse it was, how full of grace
Not dyssolued with no vyolent pain
But passing away with an easy vain
Even as a sweet light that comes to decay
Little and little consumynge away
When that the birth lycoure is past and gone
The flame extincte then light is there none
Not pale she lay but whyter then the snow
That the wind against the hyl does blow
As he that weary is, and would have rest
So she lay when death had her oppreste
And as one that slepeth soft and quietlye
So might they all then and there espy
Dreadful death that fools have in disgrace
Fair and beutifull in that swetest face.
The second Chapter of the Tryumphe of death.
THe night following ye this horrible chance Fell, to my hartesioye and
pleasaunce
That made in manner the sone lose his light
And from ye earth took also all delyght
And the fair flower in heaven on high set
My guide gone and I with sorrow fret
And blind left from al joy and pleasure
The sweet soft season pleasant be ye sure
With the cold that spredde was in the air
Before Aurora most delicate and fair
Takes away with his wholesome streams
All untrue and feigned false dreams
Even at that time to me did appear
Semblaunt to that season a maid fair and clear
Crowned with rich orient pearls white
And for to increase the more my delyght
Her fair hand stretche forth then did she
And softely syghyng gently spoke to me
Do thou not know me says she me tell
Her that sometime thou dyddest love so well
Of whom thy heart was all set on fire
And made the forsake all foul and vile desire
Thus saying with a sad sobre countenance
She sat her down my joy and my pleasaunce
And made me sit by her even there
Upon a bancke me thought we twain were
Which was shadowed with the Laurel tree
A great beche thereby well might I see
And I so set much like in such a case
As he that speaks and wepeth a great pace
So did I answer unto this Lady dear
O thou fair creature without to have a pear
How should it be that I the should forgette
Sythyns that ever my heart on the was set
Art thou alive or dead I long to know
I am alive says she thou may me trow
And thou art dead and so still shall be
Till that the last hour that takes the
From the earth, now mark well what I say
The time is short, and our will always
Is long, and therefore I the read
What thou wylt say that it be said with speed
Lest that the day that comes at the hand
Make thou shall not here no longer stand
Then said I O Lady sweet and pereles
That have proved I se it doubtless
What life and death are both certain
Tell me if death be so great a pain
She answered forthwith and to me said
Men's blind opinion makes it to be frayde
But for to tell the what it is in dead
Death is dissoluynge of all doubt and dread
And clean delyuers us from a prison dark
Specially to him that gently does warke
But unto him that has done amys
And all on covetousness his heart set is
It is a pain and doloure infinite
But I that from that am free and quyte
For this death which I did assaye
For which thou have mourned to this day
Would make the merry and all thy soores heal
If half the joy thou had that I do feale
Thus spoke she, and her celestyall eyes
Devoutly she lift up unto the skies
And that rodye lyppes more sweet then rose
She held them still till I did purpose
Silla, Nero, Cayus, and Maryus
With these tyrauntes put Maxentius
Syckenes in the breast and in the flanckes
Pain of burning, fevers and cranckes
Makes the death more bitter then gall
She answered me then forthwith all
I cannot (says she) for truth deny
But that the pain most certaynlye
That goes before that the death does come
Is wonder greuouse this is all and some
But that which greuith most of all
Is the fear of loss of the life eternal
But the spirit that comfortes him in good
And with his heart does dread his rod
Unto him I say what is the death
But even a sight and a short stopping breath
This by my self did I well know and se
At the last hour when death did take me
The body was sick but the soul was well
When that I hard one by me there tell
O how wreched and miserable is he
That compteth the days of the infenyte
That Laura is in and thinks every day
A thousand days I dare right well say
Her excelente person to se and to behold
And never after se, his comfort should
Sekes for her the water and the land
And never for her in quyete does stand
But always folowinge one manner of style
How that he may in every time and while
On her to think on her with pen to write
On her to speak on hye for to endyte
This beryng casting mine eyes aside
Her among the other there I espyde
That often moved me, the for to love
And kyndled in thy heart far above
The love I bare always unto the
I know her well that it was very she
That much comfortyd me or I dyed
With her wise words on every side
And plainly to the when that I was
In my best time, and in that honest case
In youth but tender, and unto the most dear
Which made many and diverse here and there
To speak both and often of the and me
The life wherein thou saw me for to be
Was but bitter I swear now on my faith
To the respect of my most pleasant death
Which to men mortal is very rare
So that when my life away did fare
Even at that point I was most merry and glad
Saving that of the great pytie I had
To depart this world trust thou me
As one in exyle his own country to se
Then said I to her even there again
On the faith Madame which you are certain
That I ought you without for to change
Tell me now and be not to me strange
For you know all seeing that glorious sight
Above our knowledge the eternal light
Had you ever pity in your heart
Of my great sorrows, and pains smarte
Not leaving aparte your high chaste ways
Which that you used with me always
Now showing to me a sweet dysdayne
Now a sweet anger to double my pain
Now showing a peax written in your eyes
That hylde me so tied and in such wise
That doubtful I was in what case I stood
Many years thus I in love abode
Scant had I these words to her said
When that I saw even at a brayde
That sweet smylyng and fair countenance
That sometime was my joy and plesaunce
My comfort, my lust, and my reioysinge
In this wise to me most graciouse speking
From the my heart was never divided
Nor never shall but that I provided
Diverse times with my wise regard
I tempered thy love yt well near thou had marde
Because there was as than none other way
Our fervent love with honest for to stay
Therefore in like case as thou sest a mother
Correct her dear child for no another
But all to bring her to good frame
Even so did I then use the same
And said to my self full many a season
This man not louys but burns out of reason
Wherefore it behooves me for to provide
In this hard daungerouse case on every side
And surely full evil prouydeth he
That looks outward and does not se
What is inward in such a peryllous case
This in my pitefull heart took then place
And this to the as a brydell was than
As thou see by a horse reuled by a man
Wherefore sometime I showed me wonders glade
Sometime again to be as sober and sad
And yet I loved as hoote and true as you
Always saving the chosen honest dowe
Which so my will than and ever oppressed
That reason reulde my desire at the lest
And when that again I did behold and se
Thy sorrow to greuouse and paynefull for to be
Swetely and gently on the mine eyes I set
Thy health and welfayre again for to get
This was ever my wise honest ways
That I honestly used with the in those days
And when I saw the teres droppyng avail
Down thy pale chekes like unto the hayle
Then I did pray and softly then I said
Here it is necessary I give anon an aid
And when that thou were forthwith again
Into to much hope my love for to attain
Anon unto my self even thus said I
Here of necessity must be had a remedy
A hard and strayt byt I must now put to
Thus with diverse colors many mo
Myth hoote with grene with gold with white
I kept the always still in honest plyte
Thou know this well and have it told
And in many a sweet sonet it encolde
When she had said these words to me plain
With tremblyng voice I said to her again
Your words to me should be passing were
For the great love and most fetuant here
That I have ever borne my joy to you
If I beleuyde them faithfully to be true
O unfaithful man then answered she
Why should I say these words unto the
If that my words were not true and just
Now then I tell the disclose my heart I must
If in this world living to my sight
I took in the lust pleasure and delight
I kept it secret where thou I say again
Thy love to all men dydest make it plain
There was no dyfference in our love at all
But that my true love was joined all
In most honest wise so for to be
But now one thing I will demand of the
When that thy sweet balettes I did sing
Dyddest thou then doubt of me in any thing?
I think plainly nay and therefore thus
Though for a time I was contrarius
By loving strange and semyng so to be
A thousand times thou may trust me
With my thought always so I farde
Thou had of me an inward sweet regard
And more thy mind at that time to appease
I will tell the that thing that shall the please
It greueth me sore that I was not borne
By thy fair city I say to the therforne
Although my country full pleasant be
I would my nest had been nere to the
Lest that percase thy mind should change
And love some other among so great a raunge
To these words no word then I said
The third celestial spear had so arrayde
And lift in love so sore my loving thought
That answer her at that time could I naught
Then she to me with a benign love and chere
I have in this world by the great honor here
And shall have always mark well what I shall say
The night is past now comes the bright day
If that to me thou wylt more say sweet heart
Be short I bid the for I must hence depart
O said I, mine own sweet Lady dear
For all the sorrow and pain I have had here
In louinge you these words so fair and sweet
Does recompense my love and makes all mete
But from you thus for to be separate plain
Is unto me a deadly mortal pain
But one thing now to me you must declare
Or that ye from my woeful presence fare
Shall I live long tell me after you
Or shortly as I would O Lady you ensue
She answered gently as far as she could tell
Long after her on earth here should I dwell
The end of the Tryumphe of Death.
The excellent Tryumphe of Fame.
AFter that death had triumphed in that face
Which often of me had tryumphed in like case
And that the son of our world was dead and past
This ougly and di spytefull beast at the last
Pale and horrible and proud for to se
With her black baner away goes she
When that she had extincte our quyte
Of perfyt beutye the very clear light
Then as I did look about on every part
Coming toward me there I did aduert
Her that man's life for ever does save
And pulls him out alive from his grave
This glorious fair Lady much like was she
Unto that bright star that goes trust me
In the orient or the clear day appear
Even in like manner was this Ladies chere
So that there is no master in no Scole
Can take upon them to descrybt that Sole
That I go about with simple words to tell
So much great in glory ths Lady did excel
That all the element about her did shine
Not as a mortal but like a thing deuyne
Graven in their foreheades were the names
Of the honorable people whose high fames
By valor and virtue can never dye
Following this noble fame there saw I
Many of those of which I tofore have rehearsed
That by love (as said is) were sore oppressed
On her right hand there first in my sight
Was Caesar and Scipion that honorable knight
But which of them twain next to fame was
I do not remember but there they both did pas
The tone in virtue the the other in love
Was taken though he seemed somewhat above
And then forthwith was showed unto me
After these twain captains that so excellent be
Men of high valor armed full bright
As unto the capital they went full right
By that self way that sacra called was
Or by via lata whereunto they did pass
They came in such an honest order as I say
And had written and graued this is no nay
Their excellent names in their foreheads on hie
And even as I beheld them thus attentyfely
Their manner, their port, their chere and eueri thing
To these twain most highest in order following
Ensued the tone his neuew to hymdere
The the other his son that never yet had pere
And those that thou see with the swerd in ye hand
The twayn fathers and the sons that by him stand
Against these enemies that Italy did invade
Armed in bright stele they no dread had
Two there followed first, and twain after past
But he that in order was semyng to be last
In deed of the three was worthyest of fame
And after these of excellent and renoumed name
Even as the Ruby most oriently does shine
Went he with his hand and with his council fine
It was Claudius that with his wise foresyght
As a'swyft bird that takes his flight
So did he go to the field at Metaurus
And pulled up the wede, this knight gloryouse
He had eyes and times convenient for to spy
And wings as a bird to execute it by and by
There followed then after in that worthy race
The great old captain that let not to bid bace
Unto the fierce captain Hannibal and there unto
Adjoined unto him was a another Fabio
Twain named Catones with these also went
And two noble Paulus wise to all intent
Two Brutus and also twayue Marcellus
And one renowned worthy captain Regulus
That more truly laid Rome then I say that he
Loved his own self excedyng in degree
There was there also Curio and Fabricius
That with their wise poverty maruelouse
Were more praise worthy then myde was
Or Crassus with all the great gold that he has
For gold made them virtue to expel
And pouertye these twain in glory to excel
There followed these twain even side by side
Cincinato to whom the Romans cried
For help in their extreme danger and need
He was equal to the the other twain in deed
Camillus ensued the noble valiant knight
That had liver dye for the maintenance of right
Then otherwise to do but as a bertuouse man
The favor of heaven brought him to Rome tha^
Where envy had banyshed him from the town
Home to his country this knight of high renoun
There was also the vallyaunt and fresh Torquatus
That slew his own well-beloved son Cheualerus
Rather then he would knyghtly order break
He would be childles thus the old stories speak
Both the twain Decius were also in the place
That their cruel enemies clean for to deface
Uowed them selfs alas, and that willingly
O cruel vow them selfs forth with to dye
No less did he the vallyaunt hardy Curio
That entered unto the great large hole so
That horrybly was opened in Rome ye riall towe^
Wyllyngly himself therein he entered down
Munnio Lenio went also in order there
And the good noble Attibio with a manly chere
Titus Flamius that the greeks did subdue
Most with gentle pytie there did he ensue
There was also there in the press he that made
A great large circle in Syria with his rode
And with his hardy and ferse look and countenance
To his will and intent so was this romans chance
He the great and pussaunt king so constrained
That all his hole request thereby he obtained
And by him in good order there was also he
That kept as he was armed most valliauntly
The hill from his cruel enymies all
And after in that same place him self had a fall
And with this company was ye most valiant man
That kept the bridge from all Toscan
And next in order unto this hardy knight
Stood that ferse warrear that in great dispyte
Burnte his right hand because he failed
To fley the king his enemy which he the^ assailed
Even in the mides of all his noble men
This was a merueylouse hardy deed there and the^
And I saw also there in the hugh prese
He that first vanquished on the great Seese
The Cathagines and scatred all abroad
By Cycell and Sardinia by evil chanse al yt rode
I saw among the others him with ye grave sight
Called Appius that with his forse and might
Kept the men bulgar people in great bread and awe
So strayt and hard he bound pore men to a law
And after as all about I did cast mine eye
I did that person among other rest espy
That with his sweet facyons vsyd him so
That next the first in fame he might goo
But that the end turnyd unto blame
Wherefore I may right well affirm the same
That often it is seen a long prolonged life
Turns good renown into pain and strife
And certainly he was no less in fame and might
But as Bacus and great Alcides by right
Or as to Thebus the good Impaminundawas
Among the other nobly he did there pas
And after this great and worthy mighty man
I saw following among the other than
Him that in his young flowryng age
Had great lawde and praise for his vassalage
And even as much as this ferse champion
Was terrible and cruel in his natural regyon
He that followed him was as merciable
I know no Duke to be more commendable
There went in order after by and by
He that with his wisdom sapiently
The noble volumines he was there in the prese
His lawde is praised and shall never sease
Cosso was there Philon and Rutilio
And the hardy captain Lucio Dentato
With Marco, Sergio and Sceua the bold
In armies as lyghtnyng one might them behold
Their harnes broken their shield in twenty places
Persyde through with swords darts and mases
The last of them that there was in deed
With no little fame the rest did succeed
And after these noble men before rehearsed
Did follow ferse Marius which reuersyd
Ingurta of Numedy the mighty king
And the Cymbers that with them did bring
The Almaynes in fury and in rage
This Marius did their great might assuage
There went by the Marius by and by
Fuluius Faccus that with witty polecy
Destroyed those that at Rome did rebel
But he that followed did far passing exell
It was Fuluio so was his very name
Well worthy among other to follow fame
There was also one Romayne named Graccus
yt had among ye people much matter contrariouse
To his ruin at the last in Rome town
There was he this knight of high renown
And he also that much fortunate semyde
Though by me he cannot so be demyde
Was there and after him there came
The two worthy Marcelles in order than
That kept all close in their hearts I say
Their secrets they went about always
These two had great praise in Numyddia
In Macedon also and in the Y le of Creta
And inlyke manner in the Realm of Spain
Three vallyaunt famous Knights for certain
And I saw also even at that tide
The good Uaspacian and by his famous side
His eldest son but not his cruel brother
He was not worthy to be among the other
And so followed after in good order than
Narua the ancient and gentle Traian
Helio and Adrian and the merciful Antonius
With fair succession unto Macronius
That were no more couetouse of croune imperial
Then desirous for to live in virtuous natural
And whiles that I thus looked all about
I saw five Kings among that rowte
The syxte an evil hap did him take
As one that follows vice and virtue does forsake
The second Chapter of Fame.
FUll of great and infynyte maruayle
I stood beholding these noble To maynes well
Which of al other badde never no peer
And as I reuolued their famous acts clear
Which I have seen in books written and told
More was there of them diverse and manyfolde
Then I have here in this place set in by name
Therefore I now for this time pass the same
To look upon strangers virtuous and excellent
The first was Hannybal that in order went
The next was he that syngyng made his men
To have the vyctory, and there followed then
Achylles the Greek, that in his having days
Gate by his prowes a great laud and praise
Twain noble worthy Troyans were there also
And twain hardy Persiens in order there did go
Philip of Macedon, and his son Alexander
That did bring down ye Persiens great power
Unto subjection, as in old books we find
And conquered thereunto all the regyon of Inde
After noble fame they passed in that place
And another named Alexander followed a pace
Not far from the the other that went before
But O fortune how do thou evermore
Dynyde those that in the put their trust
From true honor thou art so unjust
There ensued in order there by and by
The gloryouse captain valiant and worthy
Of Thebes that ryall City of high renown
There was also he that had the famous crown
And twain Achilles, and the wise Ulixes
And the hardy valiant greek Dyomedes
Nestor the sage that lived so many years
There was the old king among his peers
Agamenon the great and the king Menelaus
That both his two wives to to ungracious
Much hurt unto the hole world did they
Followed hardy Leonydes that purposed I say
To his men a hard dinner, but hardyest of all
Was the supper whereto he did them call
With a few men he did a meruelouse deed
Among the other there this captain yede
There was also the fair knight Alcibiades
That did strange and great wonders in Athenes
With his fair eloquent speech and fair face
Among the rest he was there in that place
Melciedes was next that made all Greece free
His son followed the example ofpytye
That alive and dead his father did ensue
And among the other in preace there I knew
The nustoctes and the valiant Theseus
Arystides and the good faithful Fabricius
Which their unkind country I do say
Would not suffer their bodies to lie in claye
Alas this was a foul and an unkind deed
So to reward them for their well doing mede
The good Phocion followed whom I did regard
For his good deeds they gave him like reward
And as I turned here and there my sight
I saw Pyrrus that noble warlyke knight
And the good gentle king Masinises
That seemed angry because that doubtless
Among the Romans that he was not set
With him I knew Iero of Syracuse the great
And cruel Amylcar divided from these twain
It was he that issued from the fire and rain
A manifest token that nether helm nor shield
Against false fortune can never win the fyelde
There was Sciphas much after that rate and sort
and Brennius for all his great pride and port
That was cast down by Apollos temple side
after the other in order there he hyde
In diverse strange garments and array
Went this tryumphe onwarde on their way
And I that chanced to cast my look aside
I saw a great huge number go and ride
among them one that would Gods temple make
and he first began it for his love and sake
This was the first I say in all that rowte
But he that fynyshed that work out of doubt
That holy buyldyng of which that I do mean
Was not inward so virtuous nor so clean
as the first good king whereon I do say
Now he that followed him in that great arraye
Was he that spoke to God face to face
There was few or none that ever had such grace
And after him in like order by and by
Came he that stayde the Son so wonderly
Till he his enemies had taken and slain
O gentle trust most sure and certain
In serving God as did this noble knight
With simple word to stay the heavenly light,
I saw after hymwhere that there went
Our old father which for good intent
God badde he should his land forsake
And he for that should possess and take
The place that was helthfull to all mankind
Elect of God there did he that country find
Followed after this father his son most dear
And his well-beloved neuew also he was there
Which had the yoke in having wives two
There was with him the chaste Joseph also
That from his father went full many a day
Thus here and there casting mine eyes always
I saw the just and good king Ezethias
And Sampson that so strong and mighty was
And not far distaunt from him there went he
That made the great wonderful ship of Noe
And he also that the great high tower began
Charged with sin and with error than
The good valiant Judas that noble knight
He there followed after in order right
That would not his holy godly law forsake
Alas he for Justice the death did take
My desire with seeing all these noble men
Was well nere fully satisfied there and then
When that suddenly I did there espy
Of worthy ladies a more gorgeous company
That pleased my sight as much or more
As all the sight that I had seen before
There saw I going together in a band
Antiope and Arithia well armyd stand
And fair sweet Ipolita sorry and sad
Because that no comforth of her son she had
And Manylipe that vanquished Hercules
And her Suster alsowas there in prese
The tone Hercules took unto his wife
The the other with Theseus led her life
There followed the hardy wydowe that did se
Her dear sone slain most constantly
And revenged his death upon king Cyrus
It was a noble hardy act and valerouse
She abatyd thereby so his gloriouse fame
That well nere it blotted his deeds and eke his name
There was also she her self that lost her joy
By great mysfortune coming unto Troy
And among other that bold Lady of Italye
That domagid by arms the Troia^s maruelously
And even by her went that hardy Lady
That half her fair here bound up curiously
And let the the other for to hang beside
Till she abatyd the babilonicall pride
Cleopatra that was burnte with loves fire
There she was with all her hot desire
And among the thickest of the prese
Was Xenobia which was doutelesse
Wondre fair and sweet for to behold
So much of hardines her high heart did hold
That with her helm of stele on her hedde
She put in danger in fear and eke in dread
The high mighty Emperor of Rome town
Till fortune unkind did thrawe her down
That at the last she was made I say
Unto the Romans a great huge pray
And albeit that I do here forgete
Both men and women that were high and great
Yet the chaste Iudeth will I call to mind
That slew dronken Holyferne in love blind
And dronken as he lay routing in his bed
With his own sword she smote of his hedd
But alas why do I present her forget
That noble gentelman among the rest to set
Which pride brought from his trone dove oppressed
To live seven years as a brutyshe best
Or why do I not remember in this place
Zorastro that the first Inuentor was
Of art magyke of Error the ground
Or why art not this twain here found
That passyd Euphrates and put Italye to sorrow
Or Metridates that both even and morrow
To the Romans was ennemie perpetual
And winter and somer fled over all
Great things in few words I do tell
Where is king Arthur that did excel
And the three Cesares surnamed Augustus
One was of Aufryke a Prince gloriouse
The the other he was of the Regyone of Spain
And the third of the country of Lorrayne
But setting this nobles for a while a side
The good Godsrey after fame fast hyde
Surnamed Bulleyne that took with his hand
Iherusalem the City and eke the holy land
Now alas I say a place neclecte of us
Wherefore right well I may say thus
Go ye proud and wreched christen men
And consume the tone the the other then
And care not for shame among you at all
Though dogs possess the sepulcre royal
Alas why do you suffer it for pity
But after these as far as I could se
Few or none was that deserved fame
Saving that behind there went by name
One Sarracene that did much pain and woe
To christen men it is even plainly so
and Saladyne after did follow a great pase
and one Duke of Lancaster after there was
That with sheilde, and sword, and bow and lance
Was a sharp scourge unto the realm of france
and thus marueylyng as I'lokte all about
as one that was desyrouse amongst the route
To se more of these valliaunt men
At the last I did behold there and then
Twain worthy men that lately alas did dye
There they went in that honorably company
The good king Robert of Cecyll he was there
That with his wise sight saw fare and nere
and my good Columns went in that arraye
Uallyaunt and free and constant always.
The third Chapter of Fame.
I Could not in no wise away put my sight
From these great honorable men of might
When as me thought one to me did say
Look on the left hand there see thou may
The dyuyne Plato that goes I say full nigh
Unto the mark of fame even by and by
Next unto Plato Aristotle there he is
Pytagoras follows that mekely calde Iwys
Philosophy he did give it that name
Socrates and Xenophontes followed the same
And that fyery old ancient man
To whom the musys were so fraudely than
That dyscryued Argo Micena and Troy
How that for Helene they lost all their joy
And he did write of Laertes son also
And of Achilles that was the Troyanes woo
He was the first paynter it is so told
Of the ancient and venerable acts old
There went with him in that place hand in hand
The Mantuan poet I do well understand
Stryuyng which of them should goo before
And there followed after in have more and more
He that as he passyde in that noble pass
It seemed the flowers did spryng on the grass
It is he the most eloquent Marcus Tullius
The self same eyes and the tunge gloriouse
Unto all the Latynes there there was he
And after him there came Demostyne
That semyd to be not very well content
Because he was not accounted most excellent
To goo himself next unto worthy fame
He took it to be to him great wrong and shame
He semyd to be alyghtnyng all one fire
But next unto him all full of great desire
Went Eschyues which might perceive and se
How unmeet he was unto Demostyne
I cannot say in order nether write nor tell
Of one and other that did there exell
Nor how I did them se nor when
Nor who went foremost nor hynmost then
For it were so to do to great a wondre
They went not fare these clerks a sondre
But so thycke that both eye and mind
In lokyng on them their names I could not find
But well I know that Solon he was there
That planted so good wholesome fruit to bear
And yet to little effect at length it was
With him the syx wise sage greeks did pas
Which Greece does boste of for their wit
In one band together they were knyt
and I did with these also well behold
Uarro which all our nacione had enrolde
As their Duke the third in place was he
Of all the Romans in that high degree
The more that I lokte upon him there
The more his face seemed fair and clear
Crispo Salustius went with him hand in hand
And Tytus Liuius by him did there stand
Scant contented but lokyng very sad
Because the first honor there he ne had
And as I looked fast on this Tytus Liuius
Came by me the excellent natural Pluuius
Quick in writing but quycker to the death
To much boldenes did stop alas his breath
I saw after him the great clarcke Plotinus
That wenyng by his life solytariouse
To have prevented his hard chance and destenye
yet fell he therein for truth this is no lie
His sage foresyght did profyt him nothing
When necessity thereto did him bring
There was in likewise among the rest also
Crasso, Antonio, and sage Hortensio
Sergius, Galba, and the disdayning Licinius
Which were to much proud and to to curiouse
For with their tunges untrue and unjust
They sclau^dered Cicero they were ye less to trust
There followed after Lucides in that pres
That ordained with wisdom the hours doutles
And wrote of the batrels and where they were done
And Herodotus with his style wholesome
And he began the crafty sciense of Geometre
The triangle and the round Arball in degree
And of the quadrant fyrme and fast also
The Sophistical Porphirus next him did go
And falsely dysputed against our religion
And he of ^oo that with his disputacion
Made much matter in his Amphorisomis
Apollo and Esculapius with him is
Howbeit they were so ancient and old
That scant I could decerne what they would
There was one in that preace of Pargamo
His science is now past it is very so
But in his time it was much set by
Anaxarco without dread most hardye
And Denocrates more fyrme then a stone
So that there could no evil temptation
Move him to any thing that was vile
Or by uncleanness his chaste body defyle
There followed him self there Archemenides
With sad regard he stood in that pres
And the pensyfe Democryte next in order there
Blind of both his eyes he had no pere
There was Hyppia also of great ancient age
That durst affirm that he was so wise and sage
That he knew and understood all thing
Archisilao ensued not much unlike such rekening
That he accounted by his science plain
All thing to be doubtful and certain
I saw Heraclito with words covert and close
And Diogenes following his sensual purpose
That little shamed his desire to ensue
Among the other this strange clerk I knew
And he that showed a glad merry chere
When al his lands were lost and other gere
There was also Dicearco the curyouse
Quintilian, Sceneke, and Plutarke the famous
And after these excellent and conning men
I saw a great number together then
Disputinge of diverse sundry cases
Not to know but to find secret places
One contrary unto the the other always
That it seemed there clateryng was like iayes
With a romblynge as the ships that be
In a raygne tempest upon the large see
Even as Lions and serpents hurl together
Without profit now hither now thither
Was there disputation and after these than
Wyttye Carneades that well learned man
That could with speech a case so fyle
That were it true or false his subtle style
It was hard his craft to know and discern
He lived long without all syknes and harm
Till false envy against him did so arise
That he could not although he were wise
Resyst the fury of them that him hatyd
Nor the veneme that against him was debatyd
There was also the bablyuge Epicurus
That against Cirus was greatly contrariouse
That affirmed our souls never to dye
This Epycure cleene contrary did deny
And said that our souls were very mortal
And perysshes as best souls do with the body all
Whereby he deserved to have reprove and blame
And scant worthy for to follow fame
I saw diverse other folowinge this sect
Lyppo and Metrodorus and Aristippus ye elect
For their excellent conniuge that they then hade
Praised greatly though their saynges were bad
There was also that Phylozopher yt in very deed
Spune the subtle and wonderouse crafty threde
His wit was so excellent and his learning so fine
That he seemed to have a knowledge deuyne
zemone the Father of the Stoykes sect
Above the rest he was best elect
Well declared he as he did there stand
By the palm and closyng of his hand
How the truth was in each season and case
For he so declared it with his wise face
The vain arguments from the true even so
That many after him did ensue and go
Here I do leave to speak more of the rest
And now will tell of that thing which is best.
The end of the Tryumphe of Fame.
The excellent and most dyuyne Tryumphe of Time.
From his golden harboroughe and restyng place
The fair Aurora going before his face
Yssewed out the son so clear and syrmely set
With radient and bright beams burnished and bet,
That thou would have said even with a thought
This fair sweet planet was gotten up a loft
Thus up risen in like manner and guyse
As do these sage men sober sad and wise
He looked all about and to himself he said
What do thou now I se well at this brayde
If to thine one self thou take no better head
All thy great glory wylbe gone in deed
Take thou then I advise the good and wise cure
For if that it be very certain and sure
That worthy men by fame dyeng do not dye
This universal and fyrme course eternally
Of the large heaven most sure and certain
Shall Be accounted at the last but vain
And if fame mortal forever do increase
That a little short hour should cause to scase
I se my great excellence shall soon declyne
And how can I have a worse end and fine
Than to have no more in the heavenly sky
Than man in earth that dying cannot dye
That thynkes my self equal by special grace
Above all other to have the highest place
In the great wide and large see Occeane
Four horses of mine are there and than
That with great study. I nourishe and dress
In their rennyng course of infinity switenesse
And yet for all their great wonderful host
Cannot a mortal man that is dead and past
Put in forgetting neither his laud nor fame
It must neades grieve and anger me that same
Not only I my self the chief in my degree
But the third or second would thereat grieved be
I must than have my self with a great zele
Against these men for the wrong that I feel
In doubling my course to there double harm
For I do envy there same that is so farm
That after a thousand and a thousand years
Their high renow me and their glory cleres
Much more after their death then in their life
Which plain is unto me a perpetual strife
That am now no higher nor in no better rate
Than I was or the earth was in his first state
Going in compass with my beams bright
By this great to und bole which is infinite
When this fair beautiful son had thus said
Dysdaynyng forth with and even at a brayde
She took her course far more swyfter I say
Then Faukon that from a high flies to ye pray
Her wonders swiftnes I can nether tell nor write
For it is not possible for me it to endyte
No I say with my thought to express it in deed
So that to remember it I am in fear and dread
Then I say when that wyttely I minded this
I compted our life to be a vile thing as it is
and none other nor no better but a terrible vanite
To put our hearts on that which sone does fle
So fast away that even with a thought
Wenyng to hold him we hold him naught
He whosoever does look unto his state
Let him sone provide for him self algate
Whiles he has his fre will in his propre might
In things that be stable to set his delyght
For when I saw the time goo so fast
After his guide that makes post have
I will not say it, for tell it I ne can
For I saw even at one very point than
The yse and the rose one after the other
Now cold now hot even with the the other
That for to tell it is a marvelous case
How after the tone the the other hyeth a pase
He that with a wise judgment this marks
Shall se by true experience all these warkes
Which little I noted in my young lusty age
And that makes me now with my self to rage
For then I confess all my hoole delyght
Was in following my folysh appetyte
But now before my feeble eyes is a glass
Wherein I spy my great fault that was
Still going downward to my last end and fine
Remembryng thereto how fast it does declyne
I was a child even this same present day
And now an old man pressed to pass away*
So that for a very truth to tell it I shall
Less then a sely day is our life mortal
Cloudy and cold, and full of woo and pain
That seems to be fair, and yet is but vain
This is the unstable hope of all our kind
Why are we then so proud why are we so blind?
When no man knows his life nor his death
And this note only as the sage man says
Does not touch me but all that be alive
The fast course of the Son does away drive
That plainly and manifestly the truth note I shall
The ruin of the world is known to us all
Then ye young men that be in your fresh lust
Measure ye time long and put thereto your trust
Folyshly I say plainly why call ye not to mind
Before considered hurt less hurts by kind
Onles I blow these words to you in vain
But I do tell you note it for truth and certain
ye that do not mind, nor well remember this
With a slepy lytargy your brains combred is
For the hours flies a pace, so does the days
The months and the years, folowes always
Together in a brief short distaunce and time
So that if ye well and wisely note this ryme
We must all mortal men to another country pas
And all our great glory shall be turned to was
God ye not then again the truth I do say
But amend your evil lives whiles that ye may
Do not abide till dreadful death you take
As the most part of ye vnwytty does I undertake
O that ye will not this well understand
Of fools there is doubtless an infinite band
Sythens then I do know and plainly se
This great planet how fast it does fle
Which time when I might, by folly I have not taken
But with much great loss this time forsaken
I saw among these unwise foles all
A nation that by their science little cared at all
Nor feared not often time the course rabidouse
These I say removed and people most gloriouse
Which hystorians has taken in their guard
And poets also that wrote how that they farde
Of this it seemed then the son had envy
Which by them self so mounted to high glory
Passing away from the mad vulgar quyte
By the honorable virtuous ways noble and right
He hasted then this Son a wonders spedy pas
With much more forse then ever there was
And to his swyft horses he doubled the meat
Passing by the great bear this planet great
So that the queen of whom I have said
Would have departed from the son at ye brayde
I have hard say, I wot not well of whom
That even as a wede wastes our glory is goone
And that all our fame is but blind and derke
And a perpetual forgetfulness al our labor and werk
And he said further that all the long years
And the process also of the lusters and spears
And of worlds infinite hereafter for to come
Shall vanysh away our fame al and some
Doubtless of as many it is plain even so
As are betwyxt these places Peneo and Hebro
Or as far a sunder as that river of zanto
Is distaunt by measure from the valey of Thebrs
And that our glory is to be said by right
Even as we se the air fair and bright
Made dark and hid with a mysty cloud
And briefly this always note well we should
A hasty long rynnyng away of the time
As a poison to fame to cause it to declyne
Our Tryumphs shall pass our pompes shall decay
Our lordshyppes our kingdoms shall all away
And al thing also that we account mortal
Time at the length shall clean deface it al
And to this those that are but meanly good
They affirm and say plain yt who so understood
Not only our bodies sone away does pass
But all our wits and eloquence in like case
Thus not going but flying the world does go
Nor resysteth nor tarieth not it is plain so
Till he have brought al false worldly lust
To no better thing but to bare ashes and duste
Why than has humayne glory so much by pride
When that it is very plain seen on every side
Although the vulgar does not this thing mark
We should well by right experience know this wark
That these foles do babble they wot not what
If that the case were our short life declyned not
So sone nor so swyftly unto the last end
All the hye fame where to that men pretend
Even as the smoke does vanyshe away
So at the last al things do plain decay
This hearing me think it stands with good reason
Not for to deny the truth at no season
But to agree to that thing we do well know
Even by comparison as the son melts ye snow
So does the time put away and shall
Not a thousand famous but at the last them all
Though that the most part think it be not so
O therefore I say, how blind are they thereto
That think it much better for to die in age
Then lyinge in the cradle to go that passage
To how many men had it ben far passing better?
Yea: and I affirm it a. M. times more sweter
To have dyed being young then to have died old
Many excellent clarckes does it by reason hold
That much more fortunate the unborn chylder
Then children that be borne such pain to se
But the great number has always greatest error be
If it were so certain and there unto so sure
That after a long life should come a long fame
Who be they I pray you that will follow the same
The covetous time turns al thing up so down
And our great fame that does so hyghly soune
It is no another to be named but a second death
Nor stay is there none as the true truth says
Thus tryumpheth time and hastes so a pace
That all our glory and same it does deface.
The end of the Tryumphe of time.
The excellent and most Deuyne Tryumphe of Dyuynitie.
SYthyns that under the heaven nothing I se
Stable and fyrme but all mere vanity
I remembered my self and to my self did say
In whom do yt trust tell me I the pray
Softly I am answered unto that lord I trust
That of his promise is so faithful and just
That who so in him has a true perfect says
Shall never be dysceyued so his words says
For well I se the false world did me but scorn
And I know what I am and what I was beforne
And I se the time not for to go but to fly
And I know not in dread of whom to be sorye
But of my self that have deserved blame
That have not or now remembered the same
The fault is in me that long I say or this
Should have considered my great folly I wys
And so opened mine eyes and not fallen to slothe
To have perceived and known the troughe
In differing my life unto the last combrous age
Which by course of time continually do assuage
But slow was never the deuyne grace
To call me to goodness and virtue apase
In him I put my trust that yet in me shall be
High operacion from all evil to fly
Thus with my self disputing to and froo
I thought even very thus if that it be so
These things that in this wise turn about ye ski
And guides and gouernes it in order so merueloussi
After so much turnyng and reuoluing to and froo
What end shall I have I would feign know so
And as that I was solitary in this meditacione
It seemed to me I saw a wonderful facion
I new fair world stable and eterne
And this old world that seems so ferme
The son and the stares and the heaven round
And the great se also with the earth and ground
To vanyshe clean away and in their rome and place
A new merier world made by gods grace
What great trow ye then admiracion had I
When I saw the son firmament and the sky
Stand fyrme on one foot sure stable and fast
That with his swyft course runnyng at the last
Changed all things mortal and then restrained
His three parts brought to one part unfeigned
And then no distinction no difference of them at al
But the herb and grass and flowers with all
All bareyne and bare before and behind
Which variacion does naturally behind
Much bitter sorrow to our nature frail
All at ones together then and there to fail
Then the thought passes as the son the glass
And much more for nothing the power hase
It for to hold or else for to restrain
O what grace shall that be for man to attain
To se in that place the everlasting god
And none evil at all which of the time wood
Only comes and goes here and there
To be out of doubt of all dread and fear
The son than shall have no more his place
Neither in the hornyd bull nor in like case
In the fyshe in which two variable signs
Uarieth the yerbes the season and the times
Now we do sow and after we do reap
Now creasynge now discresing so is our heap
But happy and blessed be those spirits certainly
That be found in that holy state eternally
Sure and very certain in honor to increase
Without term or time never to sease
O how happy is he that fyndeth that way
To pass this Rabidus and dull passage I say
That is called in this unstable world a life
And is so troublouse and so full of strife
Blind and wretched I say are the mortal
That hoopeth in things that sone does fall
Which time takes away with a thought
And turns al our fancis and folly to naught
Surely they are both unwise deffe and frail
Poor of judgment and of Counsel
Yea and worse then like in dead and wretched thereto
That does not as our deutie is regard him so
That with his beck may trouble and appease
The clementes al as it does him please
Whom to honor we are not bound only
But the Angels that sit in the heaven hye
Are contented of the thousand parts as one
With ye sight of his godhed in his gloriouse trone
And so stand steadfast with a fervent Intention
Are not our minds then worthy of reprehencio^
To look on that which in the very end
Comes to no profit thereunto to pretend
For that which we so fast gather together
With much pain in mani years hither and thither
With great and troubles cumbrance of mind
To day and to morrow at the last we find
As the shadow does pass away and glyde
Even at the point so shall all our pride
Then remember ye well I truly counsel this
That after gods great dreadful judgment is
Was and shall be shall have no more time and place
But one eternity together in one self space
Nor further there shall be none obiecte at all
To hurt by our sight our weak memorial
Which is the occacion and the very cause
Many an vnprudent person in vanity to pause
That the life present seems but a play
Thinking they are to morrow as to day
But then all otherwise shall be no division at all
But little and little the hole universal
Shall Be together and winter and somer paste
And time quiet gone and no longer last
Nor these years yt we do now presently name
Shall have no more the domynion of fame
But ones their famous that shall never disseuer
But in eternity to endure famous forever
O happy are those souls that are in that way
Of which so much I now speak of and say
In joy glory and rest still to Endure
That are and shall be perpetually, so sure
And among the other that so gracious be
Most blessed of all other plainly is she
That cruel death killed or she came to age
There shall be seen in that angelyke vysage
The honest words the thought clean and chaste
That nature had set in her in old times past
And forbecause that every thought and thing
Is plain and manifest to the eternal king
When the blessed elect souls turned be
Unto the most happy state of their first degree
With the poyntinge of the finger even then
Shall Be said how, where, and also when
Lo this is he which that love deteyned
And long and many a day lamented and complained
And yet was most fortunate for to se the cheer
Above al other joys in the world of his lady dear
And she also of whom that weeping I sing
Shall of her self have great maruelyng
To behold and feel in every wise and degree
Her self above all other in Joy and felicity
When this shall be God wot I cannot tell
But she that is nygh of the great gods council
This high preuy secret in part does know
And for to declare and tell that I trow
It is as I do ymagin very nygh at hand
And when that comes men shall understand
How evil they their wanton time have spent
In gettyng worldly goods lands and rent
Wenyng for ever them to hold and possess
And yet for the final conclusion it is doubtless
They shall se them selves in very deed
Mocked and scorned to trust unto such mede
No secret nor hyd thing shall be then and there
But all secrets vnshote open plain and clear
All our conscience whether it be bright or dark
Before all the world shall appear our work
And then ye myghtie and gloriouse king celestial
That in his fearful Judgment is not percial
As reason is and as it ought to be
His wise Judgment thereto shall agree
And when that sentence is both gone and past
Each man his viage with great dread and have
As the wild beasts that have them fast to fly
Before the barkyng doges for fear they in be
Even in like wise scattered here and there
Shall Be these proud men with all there gay gere
And plainly perceive that to there hurt it was
All such lucre when these things come to pas
But those that by grace have brydled such delight
In refraining their vain and couetouse appetite
And measured false fortune with an honest use
Be merry together without fraud and abuse
Those be sure and certain for to be
With the saints in perpetual joy and felicity
These five Tryumphes yt I have here rehearsed
And under a strange color them expressed
Have new by gods sufferaunce an end
With this the sixth whereto I did pretend
Then ye that read this think this state eterne
and think that the time that does discern
This unstable world turnyng to and froo
and fearful ghastly death it is plain so
all shall vanyshe doubtless forever away
Believe me this is sure after the last day
And those that have worthily by virtuous fame
Spent well there time living without blame
And by virtue made both death and time to fere
Whiles that they lived in this frail world here
In their most fresh and lustye young courage
They shall arise tryumphantly about that age
With beauty immortal and high fame eterne
Never after that time for to feel no harm
But then before all other that there shall be
In that endless glory we shall behold and se
My fair sweet lady of whom so much I write
More beauteous then the son in his highest light
There is a little river Gebenna men it call
Where first in love I chaunched for to fall
There love did make me so long a cruel awarre
That yet I dread to think upon that star
Happy is that stone that covers that swet face
Wherein there rests so much beauty and grace
If that then I were happy in this life it to se
Here on this vile earth so perfect in degree
After that this sweet gratiouse Lady has taken
That same fair dispoyle yt semyth now forsaken
What shall it be I pray you to tell me this
Then to behold her eternal bliss.
The end of the Tryumphes of Fraunces Petrarcke.
Uyrgyll in his Epigrames of Cupide and Dronkenesse.
Nec viui nec tu veneris capiares Amore
THat wondrous wytty Uirgil yt so well cold endight
The ways to wine to virtue right hard for to attain
In his sente^siouse verses declares with reason right
How that both wine and women does put a man to pain
He says in passing measure with either of these twain
It is a thing abominable. Now here what he does tell
Although my ryme be rude to touch so high a vain
If that ye mark this doctrine doubtless ye shall do well.
Thus says our famous poet love not to much wine
Nor yet on wanton Uenus set not to much thy mind
For like as wanton Cupide thy strength does quyte declyne
So does this wine thy force and all thy senses bind
Makes a man to slacker and stumble as the blind
That he forgetes him self his enemy to repel
Alters and defaseth man's nature and his kind
If that ye mark this doctrine doubtless ye shall do well
Uenus is full of pleasure who can to this say nay
But if it fall to rage then reason goes aside
Then turns it to werynes and to a greuouse play
Most paynefull to himself when he is most in pride
Unneth his secret pastymes the fool he does not hyde
No more then does the dronkerd that all on wine does smell
They are not much unlike when reason has them tried
If that ye note this doctrine doubtless ye shall do well
Who that with wine is whitled no counsel will he keep
As Well his friend as foo shall know all his intent
Who so with Lady Uenus in brased arms does sleep
Does now and then disclose that thing he does repent
And this is not the worse that on this twain is meant
These bring in war and woe the one the other to quell
Sometime but for a tryfle till life and all be spent
If that ye note this doctrine doubteles ye shall do well.
Paris by Uenus council brought Helene unto Troy
Though that the price was swet the end was passing sower
For many a worthy warryor thereby did lose their Joy
And Troy turned unto Ashes both castle wall and tower
This wanton wylfull dalyeng raysyd so great a shoure
That of that hap that happened the world does speak and tell
Loo how Uenus can flatter when she thinks to devour
If that ye note this doctrine doubtless ye shall do well.
Then if that wine and Uenus have ones the upper hand
And on the one or both the mind set in a rage
All honesty is excluded and wytt tied in a band
And virtue fair and dread fast locked in a cage
Although he be a lord yet serves he as a page
Two periouse noughty vices worse then a fend of hell
Where that these monsters rule right hard for to aswage
If that ye note this doctrine doubtless ye shall do well.
Will ye then be wise and learn to rule these twain
Do as our Uirgill counseles and ye shall live in rest
Tie up both wine and Uenus fast fetered with a chain
Lest that with their rewards the mind be not oppressed
Let wine but quench thy thurst so is that lycour best
Let Uenus serve to multiply our nature that does excel
But and ye pass these bonds then is the goodness ceast
If that ye note this doctrine, doubtless ye shall do well
Measure is more worth then gold or precious stone
And in forsakynge measure a good thing turns to vice
To to much at length has caused many a one
For to descend as fast as they did up arise
Then thus for to conclude I count him perfyt wise
That rules him self in measure and toto does repel
So use both wine and women that ye be not to nyse
If that ye note this doctrine doubtless ye shall do well

Epitaphium Henrici Parkeri Equitis Domini Morley, quod ipse adhuc uiuens
composuit and suo sepulchro inscribi uiscit.
Clste parum quaeso uiator and pauca he uerbalege, cum inter-mor tales dalcius
nihil est quam amicitia, uera test inuoco Iesum Christum eternum iudicem me
inclitum Henricum Comite Arundel, tam ardenter dum uita comes fuit amasse Vt
moriens hoc cor meum sibi familieque sue commen dabam felicem me rudicans quod
nec ipsa mors qui cuncta consumit rapit calcat suppeditat non potuit qui pars
mei corporis diuinissima ut puta seeds animi immorta les in loco ubi tam
fidelis and Carus amicus quiesset ibi, and cor meum quiesseret. Diui dei pari
uirgine Mariae praecare quietem. Viue and uale.

Auctores incerte.
Transit honor mundi, non transit gloria cells
Ipse simul fugies; si fugitiua tenes
Nil tibi continuum breuitas mutabilis eni
Nil patitur tutum, mortis amara dies
The englysh of these verses.
The honor of the false world does pass
But the glory of heaven none end has
If then thou follow false fugitive felicity
Thy self shall be fugitive it must so be
Then remember nothing continues ever
The short mutable time that taryeth never
Suffers to no man no suerty for to have
Till bitter death does lay him in his grave
Finis.
