To the Right worship. Geruis Cliffton Esqui^e, Robert Green wishes increa^e
of worship and Virtue.
NO sooner, Right worshipful, was Alexander come to ripe years, but his
father Philip presented him a book and a horse; the one, to signify his
delight in letters; the other, his desire to martial endeavors: Pallas had her
spear, and her pen; counted as well the patroness of scholars, as of
soldiers: And Alexander forenamed, no sooner laid off his helmet, but he
took in hand Homers Iliades; scarce come from handling his weapon with his
master Parmenio, but he fell to parlee of study with his Tutor Aristotle;
counting the profit that he reaped by philosophy, little less then the gains
he got by his great conquest. These premises considered, hearing how your
worship in the prime of your youth, not only delighted in martial actiuity,
but favored the study of good letters, as a Moecenas and patron of such
virtuous labors, I resolved, if I could not hang at the shryne of Apollo
beautiful instruments, yet to deck his aulters with ^ay garlands: and if my
want hindered me from offering to Minerua great volumes, yet I adventured to
strew her temple with loose papers, though my ability was not sufficient to
present your worship with any work worth the viewing, yet I presumed as
spurred forward by the report of your courtesy, and fame of yout virtues, to
dedicate this little pamphlet to your worship, containing the tattle between a
Smith and his wife, full of diverse precepts interlaced with delightful
histories, which if they profit some, and please others, let them return the
end of both to your worship, for whom this work was first taken in hand: but
howsoever it delights or discontents, so it fit your humor, and pass with
your gracious acceptance, I shall hit the mark I aimed at, and so least I
should shape Hercules shoo for a child's foot, I commit your worship to the
Almighty.

Your worships to command, Robert Green.

To the Gentlemen readers, Health.
GEntlemen I dare not step awrye from my wonted method, first to appeal to
your favorable courtesies, which ever I have found (howsoever plawsible) yet
smothered with a milde-silence: the small pamphlets that I have thrust forth
how you have regarded them I know not, but that they have been badly rewarded
with any ill terms I never found, which makes me the more bold to trouble
you, and the more bound to rest yours every way, as ever I have done: I keep
my old course, to palter up some thing in Prose, using mine old poesy still,
Omne tulit punctum, although latelye two Gentlemen Poets, made two mad men of
Rome beat it out of their paper bucklers: and had it in derision, for that I
could not make my verses iet upon the stage in tragical buskins, every word
filling the mouth like the faburden of Bo-Bell, daring God out of heaven with
that Atheist Tamburlan, or blaspheming with the mad priest of the soon: but
let me rather openly pocket up the Ass at Diogenes hand: then wantonlye set
out such impious instances of intolerable poetry, such mad and scoffing
poets, that have prophetical spirits as bred of Merlins race, if there be any
in England that set the end of scollarisme in an English blanck verse, I think
^^ther it is the humor of a nouice that tickles them with self-love, or to
much frequenting the hot house (to use the German proverb) has swet out all
the greatest part of their wits, which wastes Gradatim, as the Italians sav Poco
a poco. If I speak d^rkely Gentlemen, and offend with this digression, I crave
pardon, in that I but answer in print, what they have offered on the Stage:
but leaving these fantastical scholars, as judging him that is not able to
make choice of his chaffer, but a pedling chapm^n, at l^st to Perymedes the
Black Smith, who sitting in his holi-dai-sute, to enter parlee with his wif,
smugd up in her best apparel, I present to your favors. If he please, I have
my desire, if he but pass I shall be glad. If neither, I vow to make amends in
my Oepharion, which I promise to make you merry with the next term: And thus
resting on your wonted courtesies, I bid you farewell.

Yours as ever he has been, R. Green.

Perymedes.
THere dwelled, as the Annual records of Egypt makes mention, in the City of
Memphis, a poor man called Perymedes, whom Fortune envying from his infancy,
had so thwarted with contrary constellation, that although he had but his
wife and him self to releue by his manuell labors, yet want had so wrong him
by the finger, that often the greatest cheer they had, was hungar, and their
sweetest sauce content: yet Fame willing to supply what fortune had faulted
with defect, so rewarded poor Perymedes with the glory of report, that he was
not only loved and liked of all his neighbors, but known for his contented
poverty through all the Confines of Egypt. The man coveting although he were
poor, to be counted virtuous, first eschewed idleness, the moath that sorest
and soonest infecteth the mind with many mischiefs, and applied him self so
to his work, being a Smith, that he thought no victualles to have their taste
which were not purchased by his own sweat. Proud he was not, as one whom
poverty had checked with to great disgrace, and yet we see that self love
hang^s in the heart not in the habit, that Plato durst say (Calco
fastidium-Diogenis) meaning that the poor Cynick was as insolent in his patcht
cloak, as Alexander the great in all his roy^ltie. Envy, of all othervites
he did eschew, as a cancker so p^stil^nt to an honest mind, that it
suffers quiet not so much as to pry into the motions of the heart. Covetous
h^ was not, as one that sought by his hands thrift to satisfy his own
necessity: and if any surplusage were granted by good luck, he slept not
soundly on saturday at night, till he his wife and his neighbors had merrily
and honestly spent it at a homely banquet. He wanted nothing, as one that
against all spite of Fortune opposed patience, and against necessity content:
And yet Fortune that she might not be thought to iniu^ious, in lieu of all her
other dissauours lent him a wife of his own conditions, whom he loved more
then himself, for the poor woman although she was barren and had no children,
yet was she of a very pure and perfect complexion, and witha^l of such good
b^hauiour, first in love and duty to her husband, and then in friendly and
familiar conversation with her neighbo^rs, that she was thought a wife fit for
so honest a husband. These two thus beloved of all the inhabitants of Memphis,
prescribed them selves such an order of life, as diverse men of great calling,
sought to be careful imitators of their method: for suffering no private
iarres to come within their poor cottage, as a thing most preiuditiall to an
Oeconomicall estate, no sooner had these two past away the day, he at his
hammers, and she at the Bellows, for boy they had none, but that sitting them
selves to supper, they satisfied nature with that their labor did get, and
their calling allow, and no sooner had they taken their repast, but to pass
the rest of the evening merely they fell to pleasant chatte between them
selves, sometim^ discoursing of what came first in their heads, with Pro and
co^tra, as their natural logic would grant them leave, other while with
merry tales, honest, and tending to some good end without either lasciousnesse
or scurilitie, thus ever they passed away the night: and for that the
Egyptians, as a great monument kept diverse of their discourses, which some by
chance had ouerheard, and put down as a Jewel in their librari^, I mean as
their records do rehearse, to set down in brief two of their nightsprattle,
which although homely told, yet being honestand pleasant, I thought they would
bread^ some conceipted delight to the hearers, and therefore thus.

The first nights discourse.
NO sooner had Perymedes and his wife Delia, for so was her name, ended their
days work, and taken their repast, but sitting safely in their simple cottage
by a little fire. Perymedes began thus solemnly and sadly to enter into a
discourse, I can not think wife, but if we measure all our actions with a true
proportion, that we have supt as daintely as the proudest in all the City of
Memphis, for the end of delicates is but to satisfy nature, which is so
partial in her desires, that were not our vicious minds drowned in gluttony,
content would seal up her request with a very small pittance, but such is the
course of the world now a dai^^, that every man seeks with Philoxenus to have
his neck as long as a Crane, that he may with more pleasure swill in the
sweet taste of their superfluous deinties. But wife, since I can remember here
in Memphis, Psamnetichus our king, was of so sparing a diet, that being
demanded by an Ambassador, what Caters he had for his household, made answer,
his Cook and his stomach: in seeming by this that his Cook bought no more in
the shambles than would satisfy what his stomach desired. But now wife, every
mean man must be so curious in his fare, that we are rather to be counted
Epicurians than Egiptians, and our Chaldees have more skill in a cup of wine
than in a ^ibrarie, which superfluity bredeth both beggerie to many, and
diseases to all. For so they drown them selves in the bottomless sea of
gluttony, as at last they make their bodies a subject for the Physician,
thinking that the temperature of their complexions can never be well affected,
unless their stomachs be made a very Apotecaries shop, by receiving a
multitude of simples and drugges, so to settle their wavering constitution:
those men that wed them selves to such inordinate excess, find diverse and
sondrie passions to torment the stomach and all the body, which no sooner
pains them, but straight, as experience is a great mistress, they calculate
the nature of the disease, and straight ^^ye to purging, to phlebotomie, to
fomentacions, and such medicinal decretals, according to the interior or
exterior nature of the disease, where as perhaps some slender fault is the
efficient cause of such a momentanie passion, better to be cured by time than
physic. But excess in diet (wi^e) breeds this restless desire, and so
many are the diseases incident by our own superfluities, that every one had
need to have an Herball tied at his girdle: well I have heard my father say,
that he was but one day sick in all his life time, being then also through
over much labor fallen into a fever. And this perfect temperature of the
body, did not proceed^ from the diversities of potions and dainty delicates,
but by a true proportion of exercise and diet: which Zeno the Philosopher noted
well to be true, who being of a very weak and tender constitution, subject
often to sickn^sse, yet never kept his bed. Being demanded of a Lacedemonian,
what preservatives he did use, Zeno willing to be brief in his answers,
showed then a piece of bread and a dish of water, with a strong bow of Steel,
meaning by this Enigma to discover unto them, that he raced out his diseases by
exercise and fasting, as two especial points necessary for the perfecting of
man's health.

You say truth husband, quoth Delia, for often have I heard my mother say, that
three things are the chiefest delicates, which who so uses, shall live long
and happily: Hunger, quiet, and mirth, but to aver your sayings to be true,
every one seeks to attain the contrary, which causes such sudden death
and perilous diseases: mo perish by gluttony than by the sword, for in stead
of hunger men seek to satisfy nature with excess, for quiet, envy at others
happiness, presents a stratageme, for mirth melancholy, and covetous
humors, how most greedily to gain, thus every one seeks that time and
experience proves most prejudicial, but the time has been, yea Perymedes, and
within my remembrance, when the inhabitants of Memphis knew not what riot and
ill diet meant, but every man applying him self to frugalitie, coueted to be
thought honest and virtuous, where as now a days the meanest does desire to
be thought proud and sumptuous. While Numa Pompilius banished excess out of
Rome, there was no drugges brought to the city from Afri^^: while Romulus
drunk no wine, excess was not noted amongst his subjects, neither had a
Physician any palm^ in his dominions, till his successors Caligula, Nero, and
the rest assigned T^ophees, and Triumphs, for such as best could play the part
of Epicures: and because my good Perymedes we be set alone by the fire, (and
with this she recht him a friendly Bezo les labros) and none here but our
selves, thou shall so what long I have kept close in my chest, certain
precepts of physic that long since were given by one of the Caldees to Pharao
the last king of Memphis, of that strename, which for that they were pr^tio^s,
as well for the doctrine as the method, I have kept them as de^e as I did my
virginity before I met thee, and with that she hied her to her hutch, where
she set out an old piece of parchment, where was written as follows.

Certain precepts of household physic, given by Rabby Bendezzar, one of the
Chaldees, to Pharao the king of Memphis.
COnsidering right mighty sovereign, that duty brooketh not exceptions of
time, but that the reverent service of an honest mind is tied to his Lord, as
carefully in sickness as in health: although want, the enemy to desire, has
not stored my library with Galen, Auicen, nor Hyppocrates, yet dutiful
affection willing to make supply presented from the garden of my thoughts
certain receipts, compounded of sundry simples, which I beseech your
highness to apply as shall best stand with your favorable opinion.

First to present an Aphorism which Auicen grudged to pen down, The w^^^ the
wo^^^ payma^^^
as an enemy to that science, receive twenty ounces of merry conceits,
pounded in the mortar of a quiet resolution, use this powder in your morning
and evening potions, forbearing to much exercise of mind, as prejudicial to
the body: Since the world the paimistresseof virtuous endeavors has all her
coffers filled with forgetful ingratitude.

And since sickness desires company, and sondrie sorts presents Galen feared
to bewray amidst his principles: write over your chamber door in Silver
letters, Neque medicus si mo^^sus: by this spell you shall forbid Melancholy
entrance, ^^e sorest enemy to man's health, ^^lancho^^, the so^^ enemy (...)
man's ^^alth.
whose operations, as they are secret, so they are mortal. If this should
fail, receive an e^periment confirmed with Probatum est. Take the sweet herb
called pleasant content, with that make a p^rfume about your b^d chamber, and
where you dyne, the savor of this is as sure a repulse to exile mela^cholie,
as the Ostracisme was to the noble of Athens.

Opportunity, presents by her s^l^e to a sick person in sondrie shap^s, some
breeding proffit, (...) discri^^ion of a ^^^sition.
others prejudice to avoid her il^usion, note this: when she comes with a
plawsible speech, her attier black in damask or velvet, a side gown, a large
cape, holding in the one hand a glass of Goats milk to restore, in the other
some secret drug to purge suspect, ^he marks (...) a good ^^hi^ition.
and grant no admittaunce, unless you see about her three marks: In her
forehead the figure of mirth, in her bosom the pourtraiture of conscience, and
the mouth of her purse sealed with the signet of content, marked thus, use her
as a friend, and send her away rewarded.

^^tience a ^^ecious ^^mple.
take an herb of a mild savor, yet very precious called patience, his virtue
is restrictiue and expulsive, ^nitting content to the mind, and driving out
disquiet from the thoughts.

^^ope a sin^ular pre^^ruatiue.
called Hope, appli^ this to your stomach as a sovereign simple against
disquiet and fear, two passions incident to many patients.

Albertus Magnus in h^s secrets, sets down the nature of sundry herbs, some
to procure mirth, other sleep, according to their particular virtues, but our
late practicioners, have found a root, ^^arts ease (...) defenso^^ against
grief.
whose operation comprehends all those properties, which they cal^ Hearts
ease, this apply to your left side both day and night, in sickness and in
health, as a defensorie against ensuing griefs, a preserver of present quiet,
and a m^d^cine general for any passionate disease. Thus right mighty
sovereign, though not as a Physician, for that our times and di^ts brook not
her ariomes, yet as a poor and dutiful welwiller, I have s^t down son^^^^
simples sit for receit^s, which if it shall stand with your ^^ghn^sse good
liking to apply, I shall rest as ever I have done an earn^st suter to the
almighty, that their operation may take wished effect, as well for re^ouerie,
as for preserving your health.

Rabby Bendezzar.

THey had no sooner scanned ever this writing, but Perymedes began to accuse
the iniquity of their time, that had made such difference in medicinal
precepts, and therefore burst forth into these terms, well wife, thus fares
the course of the world, to decline ever to the worst, for when Rabby
Bendezzar set down these principles to Pharao, no doubt Epicures had not yet
erected any Academie in Egypt, but since his time, excess has taken such an
interest in the minds of men, that his reasons would be counted follies, in
that every axiom shows not the art of an Apothecarie, but leaving such to
their follies, how happy are we that eat to live, and live not to eat, who
count it a banquet to suffice nature with any thing, having our health, when
greater poten^^tes are pai^^^ with surfets. Well husband quoth Delia, seeing we
are c^ntent with our pou^rtie, and make a virtue of n^cessitie, let us not
(nimis altum ^apere) not stretch our strings so hie as to meddle with our
superiors, but rest quiet at the delight of our own estate, and therefore
seeing the night is yet long, and our fire is like to last, and this discourse
sufficiently discussed, say husband, The husbands (...) a law to (...) honest
wi^e.
how shall we spend the rest of the evening, for what you set down I hold for
law. In deed wi^e quoth Perymedes, it is ill meddling further, than the
lat^het: the For had his ski^^ pulled over his ears, for prying into the Lions
dens: poor men should look no hier th^n their feet, least in staring at
stars they stumble. If others offend and become vicious that are rich, it
little booteth us that are poor to reprehend them, for it reapeth often
revenge, but the best reward is envy. Clytus, who was a mighty Lord, and
friend to Alexander, was slain for his good admonition: Mighty men cannot
brook the touch of their ill, and therefore ^i^e we will this night pass away
the time in telling some pleasant and merry tale, so shall we beguile the
evening wi^h some pleasure, eschew idleness, the welspring of many
mischiefs, and banish vain thoughts, that bread disquiet and discontent, my
self will tell one, and thou shall tell another. Delia by being silent, seemed
to consent, and so Perymedes began his tale in this manner.

Perymedes tale.
IN the kingdom of Tire, while Euribates reigned as sovereign, there governed
under him as his lieutenant, one Prestynes a noble man, better beloved for his
Justice, then favored by fortune, who having a Lady of no less parentage
than virtue, and yet accounted the most honorable Matron in all the East parts,
lived peaceably in his province, till Voltarus king of Sydon attemp^ed the
invasion of Tire, and finding fortune favorable to his desires, made a
conqu^st of the land, killing Euribates, an^ leading Prestynes prisoner to
Sydon: Which news no sooner came to the cares of his wife Mariana, for so was
her name, but fearing the violent hands of the enemy, ^eing big with child,
and having an other of two years o^ age, showith a few Jewels which she had
kept secret in a Cashet, im^arked her self in a little frigot, intending her
course to Lippary, where her friends dwelt: but fortune who meant to make her a
mirror of her inconstancy, as it were entering a league with Neptune, drove
her upon the coast of Decapolis, where pe^force she was forced to land, not
remaining on shore three days, before in the company of an other gentlewoman
that was nourse to her son, she was brought to bed of a man child, whom she
called Infortunio, distressed thus, she past away many days till a fair wind
might serve to transport her to Lippary, which coming about according to the
mariners mind, they caused the Lady to send her two infants a board with
their nourse, she her self solitarilie walking by the shore till the
cockboate came again to fetch her. But the destinies who are impartial in
their resolutions, having intended a worse mishap, gave her a sorer mate in
this manner: no sooner had they shipped the sely babes, but that a Bark of
Coursayres and pirates came by, who seeing this ship not ^^^atly manned for
defense, bare toward it, and borded it, ^^^rying away, both vessel and
mariners as a pryse, which M^riana seeing, she sent forth shrikes as
entreaties to pers^^^^ them to return, and most pitiful renting of her
hair, made ^^gnes of her sorrows, but in vain^, for she gat nothing but
doleful echoes of her complaints, which struck such a grief into her mind,
that she fell down in a sound, till at last coming to her self, finding she
was deprived of husband, children, country, friends, yea and left al alone in
a desert, surcharged with grief, she sat her down by the shore, and fell
into these piteous passions.

In^ortunate Mariana, whom fortune or some contrary fate above fortune has
sought to make a special object of hapless and distressed misery, see thou
not a dismal influence, to inflict a dispairing chaos of confused mishaps, art
thou not first by the unjust destinies bereft of Prestynis thy husband, exiled
thy country, a place as precious as life, separated from thy friends, she
sweetest comfort, but now deprived of thy children, Friend countr^^deate t^
man.
in whose company there did consist the salve for all the forenamed miseries.
Ah Mariana, sigh and sob at these sorrows, but what ^uayles showers when the
harvest is past, or grief when actions cannot be amended by passions. Now
Mariana, do thou see that Fortune, that fiend and graceless monster, The
dis^^ton of ^^^^tune.
the double facced daughter of Ianus, whose pleasure is inconstanc^e, whose
thoughts are variable, whose ^emples are strewed with roses and nettles, and
whose sacrifices savor of most infectious incenses: are not all her gifts
perilous, seem they never so precious? does she inriche thee with treasure,
fear that in the other hand she holds poverty, to check thy presumption:
does she advance thee with honor and dignity, know such favors are brittle,
and her brauest seats are made of glass: if with friends, alas, she presents
amidst their troops fained affections, and flattery: thus every way her
favors are mortal, and the more glistring, the more prejudicial. Too late
poor Lady, have thou tried these premises for truth, thy self an instance
of her inconstancy: What then shall thou do, ^
being thus unfortunate: hope thou can not, since thy present mishap tells
thee, fortune has resolved thine overthrow: despair then Mariana, despair
and die, so shall thou glut the ru^hlesse destinies with a most balefull
Stratageme: since thy husband, thy children, have been the first actors, end
thou desperately such a dolef^ll tragedy: let fortune see how thou scorns to
be unfortunate: fear not death which is the end of sorrow, and beginning of
bliss: but to thee Mariana, that lying in distress, yet dye happy: let not
despair ever enter within thy thoughts, grace not fortune so much in her
wilfulness, be patient, and so spite her with content, for her greatest
grief is to see her crosses borne with an indifferent mind. Time, Mariana, is
the nourse of hope, and often thwarteth fortune in her decrees, then there up thy
self, and lead here a solitary life in this desert, with such patience, as
making a virtue of necessity, then drown all dispairing conceits with
content. I but alas, my children, my poor babes, scarce known to fortune,
before envied by fortune, and with that casting her eye to the Sea, she was so
ouerpressed with sorrow, as she could not utter any word more, but melting
into tears, sat a long time in secret and sorrowefull meditation, till at last
with a deep sigh she groned forth these words. ^
Hope and patience, and with that she rose, and resolved to live as a savage
woman, till death or some better destiny, might mitigate some part of her
martyrdom. In this resolution, she went and sought her out a Cave, which she
trimmed up, with boughs, making her in steed of her beds of down, a couch
of moss, and leaves: her sauce was hunger: her food, the fruits of the
earth. And thus she lay there by the space of two or three year, unseen, or
unknown of any body. Fortune not brooking her own bitterness, seeing how
patient the Lady was in her miseries, d^termined to add some relief to her
passions, which she brought to pass in this manner. The ^e^pot of Decapolis
and his wife, for solace sake, being one day, rode on hunting, by chance, in
pursuit of a Stagge, which they had in chase, lost their way, and happened into
that desert where they had not wandered long, but they met Mariana in savage
manner, almost naked, her hair of amber color, hanging down to her feet,
her face shri^eled, and parched with the Sun, in so much as thus disguised,
and deformed, as well with her ill diet, and the weather, as with her sorrow,
she seemed some Satire, borne and bread in that desert. The Despot and his
wife, amazed at this sudden sight, stood still, narrowly marking the gesture
of Mariana, who was playing with a little Fawn, which she had noursed up, till
at last she casting up her eyes, and seeing them there, arose hastily, and was
ready to depart, but the Despot, who desired to know what she might be, drawing
more nie, perceived by the lineament of her face, that she had been a woman of
good proportion, began to salute her in this manner. Woman, Satyr, Nymphe, or
whatsoever thou be, that linest thus as a savage creature, in the deserts, tell
me of courtesy, as to a stranger that pitties thy estate, whether thou be
bred here, and so naturally wedded to this brutish kind of life: or if some
misfortune has led thee to this extreme mishap, that so either I may marvel
at such a strange breed, or else both pity, and seek to relief thy misery.
Mariana hearing the Despot speak thus honorably and friendly, made no answer
at all, but staring in his face, called to remembrance her former estate, and
shamed at her present wretchedness, so that the tears standing in her eyes,
the burden of euermuch sorrow made her a long while sil^nt, yet at last
coming more nere, she made him this answer.

Cur^eous stranger, if I ouerslip either duty or reverence, due to thy
calling, think my savage life leads me to such ignorance, Ingrat^^tudeo^
never (...) used.
and therefore the more worthy of pardon, but whatsoever thou be, king or
keisar, know this, I am no Satyr, but a woman dis^ressed, and placed ^ere by
the envy of fortune, where time and patience has l^arn^d me to li^e content;
for thy pity I return thanks ^s one whom these mother unknown, for the
space of a year: in which time, Marcella the daughter of the Despot, noting
the perfection of Procidor, began at the altars of Vesta to offer smoking
thoughts at the shryne of Venus. For women's eyes delight in the variety of
obiectes, the maid seeing that the sharpness of his wit (a spark that
soonest inflameth desire) was answerable to the shape of his body, and that
his mind was adorn^d with so many sundri^ go^d qualities: that if his fortune
had been equal to his face, his deserts might have made him a Prince, she
began so far to enter into the considerations ^f his virtues, that hazarding
too rashly into so dangerous a laborinth, ^^ue a pe^^us la^^rinth.
she felt her mind begin to alter, and her affections to stoop to such a
state as repent she might, but recall she could not. But taking these thoughts
for passionat joys, that might b^ thrust out at pleasure, cursing love that
attempted such a change, and blaming the baseness of her mind, that would
make such a choice, to avoid the Siren that enchanted her with such deceitful
melody, she called to her bedfellowe Mariana for a Lute, whereupon war^ling a
meri^ galliard, ^^sick mi^^ats not (...).
, she thought to beguile such unacquainted passions, but fin^ing that music
was but to quench the flame with oil, feeling the assaults to be so sharp
as her mind was rea^y to yield as vanquished: she began with diverse
considerations to suppress the frantic affections, calling to mind that
Procidor was her fathers servant, a man of mean and base pare^tage, for his
birth not to be looked at of the daughter of a Despot, much less to be loved
of one of her degree, thinking what a discredit it were to her self, what a
grief to her parents, what a sorrow to her friends, yea, what a mighty
shame should be guerdon to such a monstrous fault. Blaming fortune, and
accursing her own folly, that should be so fond as but once to harbor such a
thought, as to stoop so low as to her fathers hyerling. As thus she was
raging against her self, love fea^ed if she dallied long, to loose her
Champion, and ther^ fear st^pping more nigh, gave her such a fresh wou^d as
pierst hit at the very heart, that she was feign to yield, maugre her form^r
considerations, and forsaking all company, to get her in her closet, where
being solemnlie set, she burst forth unto ^^^se pass^^nate terms.

Unhappie Marcella, has fame hitherto feared to spe^ke ill of thy thoughts,
and shall report dare to miscon^^ru^ of thine actions, has Decapolis honored
thee for thy virtues, and shall now all the world wonder at thee for thy
vanities, have thou vows thy self to Vesta, and will thou run after Venus?
will thou be counted a president of virginity, and yet subject thy self to
unbridled fancy? No Marcella, there is no sweeter friend than liberty, nor no
worse enemy than inconsiderate affection: the thoughts of Ladies, Marcella, as
they are worthy, so ought they to look no lower than honor, Blush then at thy
fortunes, thy choice, thy love, since thy thoughts cannot be contrived without
secret shame, nor thy affections uttered without open discredit: far are
these fancies, or rather follies, unfit for thy birth. Have thou not heard
Marcella as an oracle from Apollo, that it is better to perish with high
desire, then to live in base thoughts. And yet Procidor is beautiful, a favor
fond fool framed to feed the eye, not to fret the heart: he is wise, truth,
but poor, and want is an enemy to fancy: Tush, being both beautiful and wise,
why should he not be loved, will thou so far forget thy self, as to suffer
affection to entangle thee with such had conjectures? no, consider how such a
match will be most dismal to thy father, most grievous to thy friends,
prejudicial to thy self, and most gladsome to thy ^oes, the greatest grief
of all, since the smyle of a foe that proceeds from envy, is worse then the
tear^ of a friend that comes of pity. These premises then duly
considered, prefer not a Barley corn before a precious Jewel: set not a
fading content before a perpetual dishonor: suppress thy affections, and
cease to lou^ him who^ thou could not love, unless blinded with to much
love. As thus she was perplexed with sundry passions, Mariana came to seek
her in her closet, whereupon she ceased her complaints, hoping that time would
wear out that which fond love and fortune had wrought, but all was in (...):
for so did the remembrance of her late conceived lo^e^ ^lienate her thoughts
from her wonted disposition, that sh^^e and dishonor, the greatest preuenters
of mishap, Vnpossi^^ to co^ce^^ love.
were no means to diswade her from her determined affect^^^^^ In so much that
not possible to hyde fire in the s^^awe, (...) to smother up fancy in youth,
she bore such a favorable countenance to Procidor, that not only her self,
but the rest of the house marueiled at her submisse familiarity. Yet in that
she had hitherto trodden her shoe so even, as no step was so much as thought
awry, they construed all to the best, and thought her favors toward Procidor
proceeded as a reward for his virtues, not from a regard to his beauty. But
at last being Venus scholar, and therefore daring with her to dance in a net,
played not so close, but Procidor could judge of colors, and espy of the
half what the whole meant, puffed up therefore a little in conceit with the
favor of his masters daughter, seeing opportunity laid hi^ hairie forehead on
his lap, he began somewhat peartlie to pry into the exquisitnesse of her
perfection: noting that she was passing beautiful, and young, and that virtue
added a grace unto nature, and that being of noble parentage, beauty decked
nature with dignity. This interchange considered, so charmed the poor
gentleman's affections^ that feign he would have made requital of her favors
with like courtesy, if her honorable estate had not quatted his presumption
with fear: houering thus between two streams, at last he burst forth into
these complaints.

Do thou not know poor Procidor, that actions wrought against nature, reap
despite, and thoughts above fortune, disdain: that what byrd gaseth against
the Sun, but the Eagle, becomes blind, and that such as step to dignity,
if unfit, fall: that thoughts are to be measured by fortunes, not by desires:
how falle^s come not by stouping low, but by clyming to hie. Shall therefore
all fear fo aspyre, because some hap to fall? no Procidor, though thou art in
rags, yet thou art noble borne, thou art not inferior to Marcella in birth,
though in riches: then dare to attempt, since she shows thee such manifest
favors. Ah nouice in love, do thou count every dimple in the cheek a
decree in the heart, every lims a warrant of love, Venus, fond man, looked on
more than the loved, or else she passing amorous: women's smiles are often more of
custom than of courtesy, and passing prodigal they be with their eyes when
they are nyggardes in their hearts: for think not fond man that Eagles will
catch at flies, Cedars stoop to bra^^les, nor such honorable dames at such
homely peasants, no no, think her dis^aine is greater than thy desir^, for
accounting thee but a slave, and her fathers mercinarie man, she does but repay
thy labors with affability, therefore cease not only to say, but to think
she loves thee.

Procidor with these pithie perswasio^s, somewhat appeasing the sparkling
flames of love, that already were ^^ndles in his breast, applied him self to
his wonted labor, suppressing his affections with the due consideration of her
honor, and his own mean estate, and cou^ting it frenzy, not fancy, to
covet that which the very destinies would deny him to obtain. These two
thwarted thus with fear and shame, lingreth forth the time, till at last
fortune willing to present in a sweet fig bitter wormwood, found such fit
opportunity, that Procidor and Marcella met at such leisure, that not long
after, Marcella was known to be with child, which news no sooner came to the
ears of the Despot, but as a man in raged fury, and revenge, driving reason
out of conceipt^ he presently caused Procidor to be apprehended, and his
daughter Marcella, resolving that according to the law of the country, they
should die. The mother more pitiful, considering the follies of her own
youth, began to entreat her husband to spare their lives, and assign what
punishment else, though the torture were never so grievous: which by long
persuasion, he consented unto, committing them unto straight prison, where they
lay in great distress the space of ten weeks, before ever the Despot made any
question of their imprisonment. While thus Procidor lay sorrowing, more for the
mishap of Marcella than for his own misfortune: news was brought to Decapolis,
that Euribates son had gathered an host, and sought to drive Voltarus out of
the Confines of Tire, which Procidor hearing, he began thus to meditate with
him self. Unhappy Procidor, see how fortune intending thy good the hapless
fates seek to frustrate such success, have thou these fourteen years, gone
as a vacabonde about the world unknown and despised, hoping for this day, that
Euribates son should seek revenge on Voltarus, and art thou now in prison,
when opportunity offr^^h such good fortune, yea and in such a place as naught
but death can redeem thee. The Iaylor ouerhearing Procidor, asked him what he
had to do with the peace or wars of Princes. Ah my good friend (quoth he)
when I consider in what estate my father whilome lived in that country, as I
have heard, and am able almost to remember, I cannot but groan to see my
present ill hap: And who was thy father (quoth the Iaylor) S^ing, answered
Procidor, that time has s^t the son of Euribates almost in his kingdom, I
fear not to discover what I am, my fathers name is Prestines, Lieutenant of
Tire, under Euribates, and my name not Procidor, but Castriot, and I doubt not
but if I were there, for my fathers sake to reap credit and authority.
Without further questioning, the Iaylor went presently and told the Despot
what he had heard, who making small account of the matter, yet presently
considered with him self, if it were true, how greatly he should by making
such a marriage, avoid the shame like to befall to his daughter, therefore he
went and asked of Mariana what her eldest sons name was, who made answer
Castriot, and that if he lived, he was about twenty years of age, the Despot
suspecting it was he, went secretly to the prison, where examining Procidor of
al his life past, found by probable circumstances that he was Prestines son,
whereupon he began to recount unto him how he took him into his service,
placing him in his favor, then the injury he offered him by infringing his
daughters honor, yet for all this, craving no other amends, but that he would
take her to wife, Procidor made answer, what he had done was the faults of his
youth, and that he was both sorrowful and repentant, and that he might think
it firm love, and not fading fancy that forced him to commit such a fault, he
was ready at his pleasure to take Marcella to his wife. The Despot seeing
sparks of his fathers courage in his resolutions, embrased him, and sending
for his daughter into the same prison, there secretly betrothed each to other,
then took them out, and sent them to a graunge place of his in the country:
within short time they recovered their former complexions greatly impaired by
their close imprisonment. In the mean space the Despot providing all things
necessary for the marriage, seeing they were returned into the former form,
carried his wife, and madame Mariana, to his graunge, where by the way he
demanded of her, how happy it would be unto her, if he did marry his daughter
to her eldest son Castriot. Madame Mariana smiling, told him, it was
impossible, since she thought him dead: being well arrived at his farm, he
brought his wife and the Lady into the chamber where the two lovers sat, very
richely appareled, unto whom at large he discovered what had happened. When
Mariana knew her son Castriot, noting very well the liniaments of his face,
she fell in a sound for joy, but being at last revived, after many and hearty
embracings, and joy on al parts, they sat down to dinner: Castriot desiring
the Despot that he would send to Iaphet where was one Lamoraque Governor of
the town, that held his younger brother and his nourse, as slaves. This motion
was greatly agreeable to the Despot, so that he presently sent a messenger to
Iaphet, and an other to Tire, to hear of the estate of Prestines: The
messengers making as much speed as wind and weather would permit, arrived
fortunatly at their desired places, where no s^^ner the one was arrived, but he
delivered his embassage to Lamoraque, who musing to hear such news from his
brother, the Despot, went to confirm his doubt the more, and subtely examined
the nourse, who confessed as before, whereupon to satisfy his brother, and
requite the great injury he had proffered to young Infortunio, having but only
one daughter of the age of fourteen years, he gave her with a great dowry to
the poor Gentleman, and withal shipping him self in a frygot, with his
daughter, his son in law, and the nourse, he sailed to Decapolis, at whose
arrival great joy being made between Mariana and her two sons, the marriage
of the Gentlemen, was sollemnised the next week after, and to increase
theirein content, news was brought that Euribates son having subdued
Voltarus, and recovered his kingdom, he had set Prestines in former place and
authority. This news greatly delighting the company: When the marriage feast
was ended, the Lady and her two sons, with their wives, taking leave of the
Despot, and Lamoraque, sailed to Tire, where they were most lovingly
entertained by Prestynes.

Perymedes having ended his tale, his wife Delia, raging against fortune, that
was most (...) to them that were most honorable, said that poor men were like
little shrubs, that by their baseness escaped many blastes, when high and tall
Ceadars were shaken with every tempest: concluding therefore, that Mediocria
were most firma, seeing her fire was out, and the night somewhat cold, they
both hyed them selves to bed.

The second nights discourse.
THe day was no sooner spent in labor, but the poor Smith and his wife,
according to their accustomed manner, after supper would not be idle^ but
sitting close by the fire, Delia brought out an old pair of Cards, to pass
away y^ time at play, whereupon Perymides taking occasion, began to discourse
in this manner^ These Cards (wife) may righ^ly be termed Glucupilica sweet
and sower, double faced, bearing in their foreheads pleasures and peace, and in
their back^s sorrows ^ Stratagemes, presenting us with delicates, which in the
mouth taste like hony^ but in the mawe more bitter than G^ll, for although we
use them for recreation to pass away the time, yet other aim at two ends,
Lucre and Covetousness, and yet their gains but loss of time. And the
effects of gaming here now a days in Memphis, as they are many, so they are
monstrous, as quarrels, murders, blasphemies, swearing, and cous^nage, yea the
overthrow of houses and families, testifying the infamous nature th^rof.
Chilon the Lacedemonian, being sent in Embassage to Co^inth, to treat of a
league betwixt those two cities, finding the Rulers playing at dice, returned
back without once speaking of his commission, saying that he would not Eclipse
the glory of the Spartanes with so great an ignomie as to join them in
society with dice players. Delia h^aring her husband envying so much against
playing, thinking he did it to check her desire to play at Cards, began thus
to defend it.

And would you have v^ hu^b^nd so ^arre from recreation in Memphis, as to be
Stoikes or Cyniks, well had I allowed (husband) of your speeches, if they had
sauoured of any exception, but so strict an inuectiue deserves some Apology,
and therefore by your favor husband, thus, I deny not but those effects
which you repeated as fruits of gaming, are greatly prejudicial, both to the
mind and body, but they proceed not of necessity, as causa sine qua non,
but as infections that flow from the abuse, being grown into an extremity.
For we see that many things which of them selves are good, by excess grow
into the nature of evil, and so of this: for Solomon, whose divine wisdom
was without comparison, set down his censure of time, that as there were days
of sorrow, so were there hours of mirth, that the mind had as well pastimes
to recreate, as serious affairs to fatigate. Cato the most severe Censor that
was ever in Rome, amongst all his straight edictes, did not utterly abolish
gaming, but allowed the Purpurati to spend certain hours at such pastimes as
they thought necessary, saying, that moderate sport was a whetstone to the
memory. I have heard the Chaldees say, that the Lydians were the first
inuenters of Cards and Dice, and other games, and by them preserved a long
time the estate of their common wealth, which otherwise should have been
ruinated and subjected. Perymides hearing his wife to allege such sound
reasons for Gamsters, thought to join action with her in this manner.

You resemble wife those subtle Lawyers, that only allege that clause in
their evidence, which best s^rues for the proof of their plea, leaving out all
other prouiso^s that are hurtful in deed, I remember I have heard that the
country of Lidia, being oppressed with a great dearth and scarcity of
victualles, had almost subverted their estate with famine, but that to resist,
and sustain hunger the better, they invented plays and gaming, spending ^uery
other day in such sport without any meat, which they continued for the space
of twenty and eight years, by that policy preserving their country from a
general famine, by sparing so carefully their provision. But wife, the case is
altered in us, we are so far from recompencing the fault of so vile an
occupation by fasting, that contrariwise, we foster it up with all kind of
dissoluteness, gluttony, riot, and superfluity, in so much that we are not
ashamed now adays to use this proverb (that a man had better loose than to
be idle) but if those lewd Philosophers, which set down this principle, knew
their inestimable loss, not of money which they abuse, but of the riches and
most pretio^s thing that may be spent, and which can never be recovered: I
mean time, they would be ashamed of their doctrine, that to loose is worse
than to be idle, because it is joined with so bad an action as of necessity
redoundeth to the detriment of him self, or of his neighbor, yea, and
oftentimes of both. And yet because the nature of man is not able to abide
continual labor, and occasion of business is not always offered, we may
with our Chaldees in their Academies follow this precept, that time spent in
honest pastime or game, of moderate pleasure, may be set down in the register
of happy days, as hours not greatly dissonant from virtuous endeavors,
neither, says Scipio, is gaming blame worthy, if we use it as rest and
sleep, after we have ended and dispatched our business. I am glad (quoth
Delia) that you allow us any time to play. I am not so strict quoth Perymides,
but this discource wife is far from the purpose, therefore seeing we have yet
half the evening to spend, and I have no delight to play at Cards, let me
hear thee tell a tale, to requite yesternightes chat: Delia nothing dainty
with her husband, taking the tongs in her hand, to keep the fire in
reparations, began in this manner.

Delia her tale.
IN the I Will of Lyppary, there dwelled sometime a Gentleman of good parentage,
as descended from worshipful and honest parents, learned by education, as
trained up amongst the Philosophers in their academies, virtuous in his
actions, as putting in practice those principles which he heard in their
Shooles, as Axioms: generally, well nourtred, in so much that he lived in very
good account in the Island. This Gentleman called Alcimides, although favored
thus with sondrie good qualities, yet was greatly envied by love and fortune,
for his want was such, as his revenues were nothing aunswerable to his mind,
but li^ed poorly, and yet contentedly in mean estate. Fancy seeing fortune
frown, to fill up the tragedy, presented him with the sight of a young
Gentlewoma^, called Constance, who being both wise and beautiful: two
persuasions sufficient to induce affection, was so narrowly marked of
Alcimides, as he thought no object to fit his eye but her person, nor no
melody to please his ear, but the sound of her modest and grave
communication. Snared thus with the consideration of this young Gentlewoman at
the first, he found wa^es to proffer her roses and perfumes, but at the last
pills, and hemlock. For the young virgin hearing of the virtuous disposition
of Alcimides, and seeing his mind was as well garnished with good qualities,
as his body with proportion, used lex talionis, and repaied him love for love,
so far as his honesty might desire, and her honor admit: in so much that
nothing was wanting in the acco^plishment of their thoughts, but her fathers
consent: who being moved by Alcimides in the matter, flatly denied, and made
this objection, that he was to poor to make his daughter any sufficient
ioynter. Which answer so mazed Alcimides, that in a desperate mood,
aquainting certain friends with his purpose. He rigged forth a ship to sea,
with full resolution, either to return rych, or to lea^e his lover and him
self in the boosome of Neptune. Upon which determination resting, he loosed
with his companions from Lyparie, and in manner of mart, made hauock on y^
Coast of Barbary, so that in short time he became very rich, but insatiate
couetise, that like the serpent Hidaspis is ever a thief, so haled him to the
hope of more rich purchase, that at last he and all his men were taken by the
Sarrasins, and carried away prisoners into Thu^nes. The news of this mishap, as
report must ever be prattling, came flying to the I Will of Lypary, that the ship
wherein Alcimides and his Soldiers was imbarqued, was drowned in the Coast of
Barbary: Constance no sooner heard of this cursed Stratageme, but she
determined to end these miseries with death, and that in the sea, that she
might imitate Alcymides, who was reported to perish in the same Element: to the
end therefore, ^ir purpose might the more easily be brought to pass,
Consta^ce walking down to the shore, found a little fisher boat ready
furnished, with mast, sails and other provision, floating in the the haven.
Which Constance espying, taking this for good occasion, she speedely went into
the boat, and as well as she could: as the women of that Island are most
skillful in navigations, haled forth into the maine, and there committed her
self to the mercy of the wave and winding, thinking by this means to procure
sonest her fatal end, since so many accidents were ready, as death and
danger every minute. Passed thus two or three days along the Coast, till
at last a Southeast wind, drive the ship upon the shore of Barbary. The
Bark thus beaten up, there was at that present in the same place a poor
woman, who made clean the fishermens nets, which seeing the ship so roughly
arrived, thought the Mariners had been a sleep, to warn them therefore of
their landing, she went up the hatches and found none, in so much that seeking
further, she found this young Gentlewoman fast a sleep, as one secure and
careless of her misfortune, whom the poor fisherwife waking, perceiving by
her apparel, that she was a Christian, demanded in the latin tongue of whence
she was, and the cause of her so strange imbarking. Constance risen as it were
from a dream, hearing one speak latin, thought she had been driven back
again to Lypary: but casting her eye about, and seeing her self in an
unknown Coast, she craved of the woman the name of the country, who told
her, she was in Barbary, near a citti^ called Su^e. Which greatly grieved
Constance, that her death was prolonged, by such a luklesse adventure: so that
fearing some dishonor in so barbarous a country might befall her virgins
estate, she sat her down and wept. The poor woman taking pity of her
passions, carried her home to her little cottage, and there as well as she
might, so comforted the distressed maid, that she told her from point to
point, the some of this hapless accident: and grew so far in familiarity,
that Constance demanded of her what she was, who made answer, that she was
of Trapany, a servant to certain fishers, hir-name Mawdleyne: Constance seeing
she was a Christian, and could speak Latin very perfec^lie, began to entreat
her that she would for the love of their religion and faith, tell her what
course she had best take, that she remain for a time safe without prejudice
either of honor or honesty: Mawdleyne a woman of good and virtuous disposition,
told her that there was a Sarrazen widow in the City, of virtuous life and
good conscience, whose house was often a sanctuary for the distressed, there she
durst assure her self she might for a time remain, till time and opportunity
should better provide for her estate: Constance glad of this news desired
Mawdleyne to favor her with the benefit of that service: who willing to
pleasure her before two days were pas^, setting all things to her mind in
order, went with Constance to the widows house, who having heard before of
Mawdleyne of this maid, gave her very good intertainement, and as one
pitying her distress, heard her sorrow with tears and remorse: well,
Cons^an^e thus placed, being in the company of sundry other maids that wrought
needle-worke, so applied her self to her labor, that not only by her
diligence she procured her mistress favor, but by her courtesy, the general
love and good liking of all her fellows. Remaining thus quiet, though not
satisfied, fortune willing after so sharp a Catastrophe, to induce a comicall
conclusion, tempered her storm with this pleasant calm: Alcymedes lying thus
in prison, having no hope to recover his freedom^, but looking every day to
be condemned perpetual slave to the Galleys, news came that a Nobleman of
great reputation, dignity and power, had made claim to the kingdom of
Thimes, as his own, and meant by the sword to take it from Mar^ucio that th^n
presentlye possessed it: this report coming to the ears of the prisoners,
Alc^m^des who knew very well to speak the Bar^arian tongue, told his keeper,
that might it please him to bring him to the kings pres^nce, he would take
such order with his grace, as he should in despite of fortune remain
conqueror. The Iaylor seeing the request was of importance, told it presentlye
to his Highness, who in great have sent for Alcimide^, who gathering the king
and his Nobles together, discovered unto them such a piece of politic service,
that they all consented to let Alc^medes have the leading of the vaward, who
undertaking the charge, as a man greatly experienced in martial discipline,
carried his men in squadrons and troops so artificially, as his warlike skill
did greatly encourage the soldiers: having thus set his men in arraye marching
forward to meet the enemy, when the battles were within v^w and ready to
join: Alcymedes taking the King by the hand, presented him to the face of all
his army, and then began to encourage them on this manner:

I need not worthy Gentlemen and Soldiers of Barbary, seek to encourage you
with a long discourse, unless putting Oil in the flame, I should put a spur
to a free Horse: your former valiant resolutions manifested in many battles,
the honor whereof still glories your name with renowm^, assures me, were the
enemy like the sands of the sea, and M^rs himself opposed against our forces,
yet the quarrel good, and our minds armed with invincible fortitude (the
virtue that dares fortune in her face) maugre fates and destinies, you shall,
as ever you have done, return with an honorable conquest. And for that the
cause touches your King, who counts himself a fellow-partner in your
fortunes, see he presents himself as the first man in the battle, and last
man in the field, unless death give him a princely quittance of his kingdom:
let him be a myrror this day of your magnanimity, let his actions be your
presidents, press but as far as your General, and courage Gentlemen, the
victory is ours: see how your sorrowful Countrymen, only animated by the
rebellious persuasion of a traitor, stands to receive us, whose cowardice
scarce dare march a foot to meet us: I see, yea I see, in their very faces,
the portrature of fear, and therefore Gentlemen, God and our Right, and with
that he put spurs to his horse, and gave a furious and valiant onset upon the
enemy.

The king ashamed to perform any less then Alcimides had promised, taking a
strong lance in his hand, pulling down his Beuier, rusht most furiously upon
the enemy: his So^ldiers noting the unlooked for courage of their King,
followed with such a desperate resolution, that the enemy amazed at the valor
of Martucio, who like a Lion, massacring whom he met, ran without stop through
the troops, they laid down their weapons without any great slaughter. But
Martucio forgetting they were his native Countrymen and his subjects still
raged, till meeting him that made claim to the crown, in single combat he
slew him princely in the field: stayed at last by one of his Lords, who told
him the battle was ended by the submission of his subjects, who were ashamed
that they had been so forgetful of their allegiance, causing the retreat to
be sounded, he peaceably marched on toward Susa, where putting certain of the
chief offenders to the sword, he sent the rest home in quiet. The victory
ended, the King presently sommoned a parliament, where with the consent of all
his Commons and Nobility, he proclaimed poor and distressed Alcimides Duke
of Tunize, and caused him to ride through the City with a Garland of Bays on
his head, and Princely robes, in great and sumptuous magnificence. Being thus
advanced, the report thereof came unto the ears of Constance, who now knowing
him alive and in great authority, whom long since she held for dead, she
conceived such inward joy, that she could not but outwardlye commit the sum of
her mind to the Gentlewoman with whom s^e dwe^t, who pitying her plaints,
promised as soon as opportunity would give her leave, to manifest the matter
to Alcimides: Constance impacient of delays would not let the old Gentlewoman
take no rest, till one morning she went to A^cimides, and told him that a
certain Gentlewoman was come from Lippary, who desired to speak with him in
secret: Alcimides courteous, as one whom honor had not made proud, thanked the
widow for her pains, and went home to her house, where she presented him with
the sight of Constance: Alcimedes hearing long before that she was dead, stood
amazed at the sudden adventure, but she poor soul whom love stunge at the
very heart, could not abstain, but blushing, leapt about his neck, bewraying
her joy in tears.

Alcimedes the most joyful man alive for so happy an encounter, after many
sweet imbrasings past, demanded the cause and means how she came into
Barba^ie, who recounting the fore rehearsed discourse, greatly gladded
Alcimides for the finding of so tr^stie and true a friend: Long he stayed not
but that he revealed this comicall History to the King, who desirous to see
the Maid, entertained her with great and princely courtesy, and with all
speed to both their contents, solemnized the marriage, which past, he sent them
according to their calling rich home to their friends in Lippary.

Delia having ended her Tale, Perimedes began to take occasion to talk of the
inconstancy of Fortune, who only coueted to be counted variable in all her
actions, for, quoth he, I tell thee wife, I have seen in my time many rich
men, who lived secure in the abundance of their wealth, driven to such
extreme poverty, that their superfluity was ^ot more then their ^nsuing
want, and many baze peasants by her flattery be so hoisted up to the top of her
wavering wheel, as they b^e potentates and mighty men of the earth, but her
favors are such as they include misfortune, and when she presents the most
comicall shows, then she intends the most balefull and dismal stratagemes, as
the instance of Alexander the great may serve for a president, who in twelve
years making a conquest of the whole world, and so ^^attered by Fo^tune as he
seemed to hold her favors in his own hand amidst his most glee and greatest
glory, was ^^wardlye poisoned in Babylon. At this Pe^imedes was ready to
enter into a long discourse, his Wife Delia told him the night was far spent,
whereupon taking his wives motion for a warning, commanding her to Co^^re l^
fen: the poor Smith and his Wife went to Bed.

The third nights exercise.
THe next day being a solemn day of sacrifice observed amongst the Egyptians
Perimedes shutting up his shop as one that feared to give the least occasion of
offense tying his devotion to the Gods, his obedience to his king, his love to
his neighbors, and his will to the law, causing his wife to honor the
festival Rytes with her best raiment, him self ietting in his holy day
Cassocke went to the temple, where offering up his oraysons after the Egyptian
manner: the Flamins and Rabins having expounded their laws, the poor Smith
and his wife returned home to dinner, where having taken such repast as fitted
their diet and was agreeable to their poor preparation: Perimedes to digest
his great cheer, with a little that began on this manner: noting to day wife
(qu^th he) at y^ temple, ^ertaine of our great Lords of Egypt whose beds are
fram^d of Arabian bisse, whose houses stuffed within with plate and outwardly
decked and adorned with such curious work of porphurine, as nature in the^
seems to be ouerlaboured with art: Their ports glistring like the palace of
the Sun, show to all passengers wonders, to be written in ye registers of their
memories: But wife, when these great Potentates of the Earth came to discover
their inward devotion at their o^^ertorie in giving to the Gods, and the poor,
I perceived them miserable, and so corrupted in the conceit of their own
wealth, that I cried out in my thoughts, these men are poorer then Perimedes:
For I tell thee Delia, this have I heard of the a^cient Caldees, whose book^s
were burned with their benes, that he only is rich, which abandoning all
superfluities rests contented with what Fortune has favored him, his estate
not pinched with such poverty, but he may live honestlye and vertuouslye: who
so resolute in this content makes not his thoughts and passions subject to the
restless desire of gain, Is vere habetur dives, for wife, the mind is the
touchstone of content, and holds the balance that protortioneth quiet or
disquiet to Kings: for Pharao our great Prince is not therefore fortunate, for
that he is invested with the diadem, for his Crown rests in the lap of
Lachesis, and the destinies may deprive him of his dignity this night: Kings
as they have crowns, so they have cares, and in passing unto pleasure, they
step upon thorns, and run over a sea of Glass: not therefore rich for that
they are kings, unless content with his annual revenues, and satisfied with
such limits as are left to the Pharaos: resting thus he is both a king and
rich, in that seated amidst the glories of the world, the sundry objects of
delights draws not away his eyes, nor as the Sirens with their enchanting
melodies, nor gold nor glories can hale him with any pleasing sorceries, from
the quiet Castle of Content: thus minded Delia I tell thee I call him rich,
and therefore hold my self one of the wealthiest subjects in all Aegipt, in
that all my desires have rested themselves in a peaceable concord, for my
estate I desire to be no higher then a Smith, as thus spighting fortune by my
occupation, having my Tongs in my hand as a Scepter, to rule in my shop, and as
Mercuries Caduceus to charm the inconstancy of the vain Goddess: her
greatest frown can be ^ut want of a little work, and that I ouerpasse with
patience, and if she smile, then begin I to laugh, that Fortune is glad to
become friends with a poor Smith: Now for richesse and treasure I have
plentye, in that I want none, but count my poverty the very storehouse of
abondance.

Delia hearing her husband thus solemnlye deliver such Stoicall paradoxes,
joined issue with him in the same plea, and began to prosecute the matter in
this manner. Indeed husband quoth she, the minds of men are so fiered with the
restles heat of couetize, as they beat out hot^er flames then Enceladus does
from under Etna, and are like the Serpent Hidaspis, which the more she
drinks, the more she is pinched with thirst, insomuch that they count great
gifts little goods, caring not if they may gain, what means they use to get,
counting all things honest that are profitable, and thinking gall most sweet,
if tempered with gold: these men that have no mean I think most miserable,
could they with Nimrod build up Babell, or with Ninus lay the foundation of
Babylon: for I tell thee Perymides, it is not the coin but the conscience, not
the coffers stuffed with store, but a mind luld a sleep with pleasing content,
that makes a man rich: for he that defraudeth his neighbor with vnderminding
policies, or circumuenteth him with any intricate deceit, exacting unreasonable
taskes and customs, wrapping his friends as if in Dedalus Laborinth, in the
quiddities of prejudicial bargains, prying into the state of the common
treasury, so to indo^mage the commonwealth for his own commodity, gaping as
Uultures after the testaments of the dead, not ceasing with the Ravens to pray
on liuelesse carcasses: such as these husband, (quoth Delia) are not wealthy
in that as miserably they want, but are poor in that they leave no unlawful
means to covet. Then quoth Perymedes of these former inferred premises we may
conclude, that poorly content is better then richlye covetous, which the
ancient Romans auered in their censures, for whether shall we estimate the
many that king Pyrrhus sent to Fabritius, or else the continency of Fabritius
which made denial of the same, being proffered frankelye by so great a
potentat: and did not the answer of Marcus Curious more glory him and his
family with immortal renown, in rejecting the mass of Gold sent him by the
Samnites, then all the treasure they brought in such pomp to Rome, was not the
liberality of Africanus, who parted his small Farm with his brother Quintus
Maximus, registered in Rome as a thing deserving perpetual memory, when the
great wealth and possessions of Lucius Paulus perished at his funerales, leaving
behind him no monument, but that the Romans did account him poor and
miserable. These glorious instances of Roman excellencye, prove, that the true
richesse consists not in the abundance of wealth, but in the perfect habit
of Virtue: for richesse is casual and momentary, subject to the frown of
Fortune, as brittle as Glass, standing upon a Globe that is never permanent,
like to the Trees amongst the Natolians, that being covered with flowers in the
morning, are tawny and withered before night, resembling the fruit in the
Garden Pesparades, which glistering like gold, touched presently turns to
Ashes: whereas Virtue is not accidental but sets out her Flag of defiance
against Fortune, opposing himself against all the conspyring chances of this
world: like Aeneas armor not to be pi^rced with any contrary constellation, so
insorted into the minds of men, as neither can perish by Shipwreck, which made
Bias escaping from the Sea, bouldly and merrily to say in his greatest want:
Omnia mea mecum porto: And the son of Anchises carrying his Father on his
back through the flames of Troy, looking behind him to say, Animus infractus
remanet and virtus inter hosts and ignes viget. Then Wife thou see they
only are rich that covet nothing, that want nothing, but living in content,
i^rich themselves with Virtue: then Delia let me boldlye say (and with that the
Smith set his hands by his side) that I am rich as the prowdest in all Egypt.
But now that I may not be t^^ tedious in my discourse, I will to temper mirth
with melancholy, and to sing the Satyrs of Horace to the Lute, rehearse thee a
pleasant Tale tending somewhat to this effect: and thus the Smith began.

Perymedes tale.
HEreby in the confines of Babylon, dwelled a Duke called Grada^so, a man whose
many years had by long experience learned, that to trust sundry men, was to
seek for an Eele amongst many Scorpions, and therefore (...) granting (...)
admitted none into familiarity, unless ^e might sell ^is courtesy for
pro^^t, and they buie his ^au^ur with repentance But in private and secret
counsa^les, he used no free^d but himself, fearing to find that in others,
which he found ^anted in his own cankered stomach, so (...) to shadow his
spightfull practices with glosing colors, as resembling the Pyrite Stone, he
burned sorest when he was thought most cold: to trust any he thought was to
despise security, and to desire mishap, and therefore known more for his
authority then by his manners, he carried his thoughts sealed up with silence,
pained with that which he most liked, namelye Fearful mistrust. This Gradasso
although despighted by the Gods and nature, for placing such odious qualities
in such an old carcass, yet was he favored by Fortune in possessing large and
sumptuous revenues, and not only advanced with the title of honor and
dignities, but also wherein he most ioyed, he had one only Child called
Melissa: a Lady so furnished with outward shape of body, and inward qualities
of the mind, so decked with the gifts of nature, and adorned with sundry
exquisite virtues, as Aegy^t did not so much despise her Father for his v^^ious
disposition, as they did extol her fame for her virtuous syncerity: for she
although to her great grief, seeing into her Fathers lawless actions, how
with pretensed flatterye like to the H^ena he had snared some to their utter
mishap, and that under color of law, with exacted extortion he had oppressed
the poor, sought not only as far as she durst, to pull her Father from such
inordinate gains, but also secretly made recompense to such as her Father
unjustly had almost brought to ruin.

This M^lis^a flourishing thus in happy fame, the old misard her Father casting
beyond the Moon, knew by experience, that as the herb Spa^tania no sooner
sprowteth above the ground but it blometh, and the ^gges of the Lapwing are
^ea^ce hatch^^ before the young ones can run^ so women resembling the Apples of
the Tr^e Pala, are scarce ripe before they ^^^^re to be plucked, and their
years not able to discern love before they be half ^rowned in love: these
considerations m^oued old Gradasso to prevent had I wist, with taking
opportunity by the forehead, and therefore sought out amongst his bordering
neighbors a young Gentleman, the son and heir of a Baron, whose revenues as
they were great, so they adjoined fitly to his possessions: which made the
doting Duke to endeavor to buy him a son in law answ^rable to his own
opinion: finding his Daughter therefore in fyt time and place, he brake with
her in this manner. Thou know Melissa (quoth he) how careful I have been
since thy mothers death, not only sec^etly to provide for thy welfare, but
openly so to grace thee with exterior favors, as all Egypt have judged me a
Father worthy such a Child: and thee for thy obedience deserving what my
liberality has so carefully imparted. In thine nonage I endeavored to
instruct thee in modestye and manners, by such virtues to seem gracious in the
eye of every man, now that thou art grown to ryper years, and art famous for
the method of thy life through all the country, seeing thou art fit for
marriage, I have sought thee such an husband, as shall honor thee with his
birth, and enrich thee with his possessions, a man though not so exquisitely
formed by nature, as he may seem a second Paris, yet of such wealth as he
may countenance and credit with the abundance of his revenues, and to be
brief daughter, it is Rosilius son to the Lord Rosilius latelye deceased:
after he had named the man, he ceased to hear his daughters replye. Melissa
noting with a secret mislike her fathers motion, yet for ^^are durst not oppose
her self against his determination, but told him that as she was his Daughter,
so she was bound by the law of nature to obey him as her Father, and his will
should be to her as a law, which by no means she dared to in^tinge: this
answer pleased the old covetous Duke, that with as convenient speed as might
be, he brake the matter to Rosilius, who having no more wit then he well could
occupye, noting how fair a Lady he should possess, condiscended with great
thanks to the Dukes motion, and thereupon frequenting the house of Gradasso
began after his homely fashion to court the young Lady Melissa, as fit to woe
so brave a Gentlewoman, as Pan to be sent from Troy inambassage to Helena:
well, these two discords of descanting, to make a concord:

It fortuned that a Gentleman next neighbor to the duke, had a young son
called Bradamant, a man so sufficiently graced with external favors of
nature, to beautify his body, and with inward quallities and virtues to
advance his mind as he was generally liked and loved of all the country: This
young Gentleman passing by the Court of Gradasso, espied Melissa looking out of
a window: Bradamant amazed at the sight of such a heavenly creature, stood a
long while astonished at her excellent beauty, in so much that Melissa casting
her eye aside, espied him, and with that shut the casements: which somewhat
daunted the mind of the young Gentleman, to be so suddenly deprived of that
object which so greatly pleased his eyes, but taking this her modest
discourtesie in good part, he passed forward to take a view of his fathers
grounds, where as he sollemnly and sollitaryly walked, he felt in his mind a
sparkling heat of affection, which he took as a toye of youth, rather to be
laughed at for the sudden passion, then to be prevented for any ^^suing danger.
As thus he rested a little perplexed, but not greatly pained, Cupid that
grudged to loose such a nouice, having his wings plumed with Times feathers,
least he might let slip occasion, seeing this young Gentl^man at discouert,
thought to strike while the Iron was hot, and so drew a boult to the head, and
stroke Bradamant at the very heart, which pierced so deep, that no physic
could cure: For the fame of Melissaes life began to allure him, the report
which all Egypt made of her courte^ie, was a chain to entangle his freedom,
her honor, birth, parentage, and incomparable beauty, gave such fi^rce
assaults to his perplexed fancy, as no defense of reason was able to withstand
those violent impressions.

Bradamant seeing himself pai^^d with these vnacq^ainted fits, was driven into
a^uandary, whether he should valiantly resist the enchanting tunes of Cupids
sorcor^^, and so stand to the chance whatsoever the main were, or else yield
to the alluring call of Beawtye, and so spend his youth in seeking and suing
for doubtful though desired favors. Tossed a while in these contrary
thoughts, and pinched with the consideration of his own estate, he began to
think that to fix his fancy upon Melissa was with the young Gri^^o^s to ^^cke
against the ^tars: and with the Woolues to bark against the Moon, seeing the
baseness of his birth, and such a rich ^^^^all as Ressilius was^ would greatly
prejudice his intended l^te. These considerations began somewhat to r^presse
his ^^ting fancies: but Cupid not willing ^^ take so slender a r^puls^, though^
s^raight to race out these de^pairing thoughts^ with the comfortable Conserues
of Hope, and to draw Bradamant out of the Laborinth of distrusting ^ea^e, with
the assured possibilities of atchieuing his enterprise. He therefore began to
encourage ^^s Champion with these plawsible conjectures, t^a^ Me^^^^a was a
woman, and therefore to be woone, it ^eautifull, with prau^s: ^^ come, wi^th
prayers: if proud, with gifts: if covetous with promises: to conclude, that as
there is no stone ^o hard which cannot ^e cut, no Hawke so ^ammage that cannot
be manned: no Tygre so fierce which (...) ^e tamed: so there is no woman ^o
infected with the b^^ter (...) on of self-will: no^e so spotted with the
stain of hellish crueltie^ nor so wedded unto wilful frowardness, but they
may be drawn to the ^ure by some of the forena^ed practices. Bradamant pricked
forward with these pithie persuasions, and yet driven back with the fear of
some hapless denial, st^od diversely perplexed whether he should with a
momentary content sue after loss, or with a long ^isquiet seek after gain,
remaining awhile in these doubts, half frantike wi^h such ^naccustomed fits,
he fell into these passionate complaints:

Oh Bradamant how art thou diversely perplexed, driven either to purchase
hapless content with fading pleasures, or to gain a happy disquiet with
ensuing profits^ if thou choose the first, thou art like to repent at the last:
if the s^ond, s^r^ with Hercule^ after painful labors to obtain fame and
quiet: the Caspians fearing to be sti^^^d with sweet savors, wear in their
bosoms bands of Hemlocke: the people Pharusij doubting to surfeit with drinking
the juice of Liquorice, prevent such perril^ with ^hewing Rewbarbe: it is
better to be pained with the sting of a Snake, and recover, then be tickled
with the venime of Tarantula and dye laughing: hard yea hard it is, Bradamant,
to ride on Seianus Horse, for his beauty and then perish, or to gain the Gold
of Thalessa with assured mishap: better it is for a time with sorrow to prevent
dangers, then to buy fading pleasures with repentance? Why Bradamant, what
cause shall thou have to repent? Is pain always a companion to p^easure? is
danger the hand-maide to Lou^? is Fancye never painted but treading upon
thorns? yes no do^bt, as Cupid has arrows that do pierce^ so they make
sweet wounds. Ve^us I grant ^a^h a wrinckle in her brow^ but two dimples in
her ^^eekes^ ^he frown^s not upon them that sacrifice at Pa^hos: but pains
such as de^pise her Deitye Love Bradamant, why do thou love, yea alas, and
therefore unhappy because in love, a passion so unfit for thy young years, as
if thou yield to Cupids allurements, thou shall have cause either to curse the
Des^inies ^or appointing him a God, or accuse the Gods for errating th^e a man:
for love whatsoever the luck be is alwai^s tempered with loss: if thou win,
thy gains shall be like theirs who buy Honey mixed with Gall, the sweetness
not half so much pleasing the taste, as the bitterness infecteth the
stomach: Pa^rhasi^s drawing the counterfeit of love, painteth her tickling
Youth on the left side with a Feather, and stinging him on the right with a
Scorpion: meaning that they which are sotted with the sorceries of Cupid, reap
for a dra^ of Go^de a pound of dross, and for a pint of pure oil, a whole
^un of infectious poison, being a fading pleasure mixed with bitter passions,
and a miserye tempered with a ^ew s^riue not then against the stream, feed not
with the Dear against the wind, sake not to appease Venus with slanders, bu^
with sacrifice: Melissa is beautiful and virtuous, to be w^^^e with entreaty,
if thou fear not to attempt: what th^ugh Grada^^o frown, may not the favor:
he s^^fled with ^^uer^^e, and therefore must hate: she stirred by Venus, and
therefore must love: if Melissa like, pass not, if he lowre^ yea (...) both
your parents mislike, so you two rest in contented q^iet. Bradamant had no
sooner uttered these words, but he felt his mind half eased with slattering
himself thus in his f^llies, so that from doubting if he might love, he fell
to devising how to obtain his love: Resting thus diversely passionate: M^^issa
of the contrary part began greatly to affect young Bradamant, and though his
mean birth, his parentage and living, did dissuade her from liking so base a
youth: yet a restless desire, a secret Idea and contemplation of his virtues
and beautye, made him think if Gradasso would grant, she could prefer
Bradamant before Resillius, so that hindered in a Dylemma, she began thus
doubtfully to debate with her self: Oh unhappy Milissa, whose mind is payned
with unacquainted passions, and whose head is troubled with unequal thoughts:
shall thy Uirgins state be stained with fond desires, or thy young years
darkened with Cupids shadows? It Is fit for thee Melissa to spend thy youth in
labors not in loves, to pace sollemnly after Vesta, not to gad wantonly after
Venus: maids must have denial in their mouth and disdain in their hearts, so
shall they safelye remain free, and securelye despise Fancy: Diana is painted
kissing Virtue, and spotting Beauties face with a Pensell: Uirgins must delight
in ancient counsels, not amorous conceits, least in smelling upon sweet
Uiolets, they stumble on bitter Rue. Truth Melissa, thou give good precepts
if thou can follow thine own principle, thou art persuaded by Bradamant to
love, but take heed of such balefull allurements, arm thy self against his
charming desire, with a chaste disdain, so shall thou be sure as he which
wears Laurel cannot be (...) carries (...) of ^ Eagle perish with (...)
shall neither Love (...) pain (...) with hapl^sse (...) think this, Brad^^^^^
is a man, and therefore inconstant: and as he says a Lover, and therefore a
flatterer, as fickle as the Woolues of Syria which forget their pray ere they
be half satisfied, and as dissembling as Jupiter, who feeds Semele for a
while with Nectar, (...) then kills her with fire. Since then Melissa to love
is to l^^fe, fear not Venus as a Goddess, but despise her as a ^anton,
entreat not Cupid with prayers, but with curses: tell Fancy thou will reject
his as a vassal, not regard her as a virtue: for Bradamant rail at him as a
peasant to low for thy passions: in steed of courtesy, present him with
Medaeas enchanted Casket: does Bradamant love Melissa? no he hates Melissa,
he faineth love to procure thy loss, he flattereth to try thy folly, and if
he find thee to fond, he will bring thee a sleep with melody, and then strike
of thy head with Mercury. Oh Melissa condemn not Bradama^t, without cause, if
thou meanest not to love him, delight not to lack him, proffer him not Netl^s
since he presents thee with Roses: if he yield the Honey rub not his hiue with
gall: answer him freendly, though thou strain courtesy to flatter, for
sweet promises please more then sower gifts, and pleasant poti^ns are better
taken though infectious, then bitter pills though most wholesome: and know this
Melissa, that the flame of the hill Chymera, is to be quenched with Hay, not
with water: the mountain in Harpasa to be removed with ones finger, not with
the whole strength: and love to be driven out with reason, not to be thrust
out with force, least in striving against Venus she play the woman and seek to
revenge. Melissa had no sooner uttered these words, but going into her Closet
she passed away the time two or three days perplexed: her sweet love
Rosilius could not with all his clownish courting, drive her from her dumpes,
but still all her thoughts and imaginations were fixed on the wit and
personage of young Bradama^t, so that both the lovers sought by walking in the
woods to meet there (...) within (...) course that hi^ love (...), repaire^ to
a grou^^ (...) Melissa presently res(...) ^he Saint whom in heart she did
reverence, steal^ng secretly amidst the thicket she determined to hear some
part of his passions: Bradama^t full of melancholy dumps, tuning his Lute,
began to warble ^^t this madrigale: The Swans whose pens as white as Iuory,
Eclipsing fair Endymions siluer-loue:
Floting like snow down by the banckes of Po.
Nere tund their notes like Leda once forlorn:
With more dispairing sorts of madrigales,
Then I whom wanton love has with his gad,
Pricked to the Court of deep and restless thoughts,
The frolike yoongsters Bacchus liquor mads,
Run not about the wood of Thes^aly,
With more inchaunted fits of lunacy,
Then I whom love, whom sweet and bitter love,
Fires infects with sundry passions,
Now lorne with liking overmuch my love,
Frozen with fearing, if I step to far:
Fired with gazing at such glymmering stars,
As stealing light from Phoebus brightest rays,
Sparkles and sets a flame within my breast,
Rest restless Love, fond baby be content:
Child hold thy darts within thy quiver close,
And if thou will be rouing with thy bow,
Aim at those hearts that may attend on love,
Let country swains, and silly swads be still,
To Court young wag, and wanton there thy fill.


After that Bradamant had recorded this dittie, he heard a great rushling in
the bushes, whereupon desirous to see what it might be, he espied Melissa, at
whose sight he stood so amazed, as if with Medusaes head he had been turned to
a stone: the Lady as much aghast, having a coosin of hirs with her called
Angelica, uttered not a word, but the Lovers made mute with love, stood as
persons in a trance, til Bradamant discoursing his loves, and making open his
privy passions, fell down at her feet, and craved mercy: the Lady as
deeply payned as he was passionate, could not conceal fire in the straw: nor
dissemble love in her looks, but flatlye told him that both the proportions
of his body, and the virtues of his mind had made such a conquest in her
affections, that were it not the crabbed and covetous disposition of the Duke,
she could find in her heart to make him her only paramour, but her father
Gradasso had provided her a marriage, whom she durst not refuse, a man able
with his wealth to maintain her, with his parentage to credit her, and that
his possessions were great gifts to content, and little gods to command, even
Vesta her self to leave her Uirginitie, but quoth she, how I rest discontent
with the match, I appeal to the Gods and myn^ own conscience: Bradamant
hearing her so willing to be won, told her that policies in love were not
deceipts, but wisdom: that to dissemble in affection was to offer Venus her
rights, and therefore if her fancy were such as she did protest, it were easy
to inioye the fruition of their loves: Not so, quoth Melissa, for rather had I
marrye Rosilius, and so wed my self to continual discontent and repentance,
then by being lose in my loves, and wanton in my thoughts disobeying my fathers
command, to disparage mine honor and become a byword throughout all Aegipt,
for Ladies honors are like white lawnes, which soon are stained with every
mole: men in their loves have liberties, that soar they never so high nor
stoop they never so low, yet their choice is little noted: but women are more
glorious objects, and therefore have all men's eyes attentiuelye bent upon them:
yet (quoth she) how I mislyke of my Fathers command, and how malcontent I
am, lend me your Lute, and you shall hear my opinion: Bradamant glad that his
Mistress would vouchsafe to grace him with a Song, delivered her the
instrument, whereupon Melissa being very skillful, warbled out this Dittye:
Obscure and dark is all the gloomie ^ire,
The Curtain of the night is ouerspred:
The sylent Mistress of the lowest sphere,
Puts on her sable coulered vale and lower.
Nor Star nor Milkewhite cyrcle of the sky
Appears where discontent does hold her lodge.
She sits shrind in a Can^apie of Clouds,
Whose massy darkness mazeth every sense.
Wan is her looks, her cheeks of Azure hue,
Her hairs as Gorgons foul retorting Snakes,
Envy the Glass wherein the hag does gaze,
Restless the clock that chimes her fast a sleep,
Disquiet thoughts the minutes of her watch,
Forth from her Cave the fiend full often does fly,
To Kings she goes, and troubles them with Crowns,
Setting those high aspiring brands on fire,
That flame from earth unto the seat of Jove,
To such as Midas, men that dote on wealth,
And rent the bowels of the middle earth
For come: who gape, as did fair Danae,
For showers of Gold their discontent in black,
Th^owes forth the viols of her restless cares,
To such as sit at Paphos for relief,
And offer Venus many solemn vows,
To such as Hymen in his Saffron robe,
Has knit a Gordion knot of passions,
To these, to all, parting the glomie air,
Black discontent does make hi^ bad repair.


No sooner had Melissa ended this Sonnet, but for fear the two lovers, though
most unwilling, parted, determining when occasion would serve, they would meet
again: yet was not their meeting so in secret, but old Gradas^o knew of their
conference: whereupon he not only blamed his da^ghter, and in bitter and
railing terms misused the father of Bradamant, but sought with all possible
speed to dispatch the marriage: Melissa passing the days in melancholy, and
the night in passionate dumpes, that her nuptials were so nigh though men
determine the Gods do dispose, and often times many things fall out between the
Cup and the lip, for the day being appointed, certain tenants, as well
Gentlemen as others, that were under the Duke, went to Pharao with general
complaints of his covetous and barbarous crueltye. Pharao whose thoughts aimed
at excessive desire of coin, took opportunity by the hand, and thought by
these complaints to possess himsel^e of all his possessions and treasure,
whereupon he sent for the Duke and Rosilius, and after he had heard the
complaints, he banished him, and Rosilius his son in law, with his Daughter
Melissa, out of all the confines of Aegipt. Gradasso willing to answer to his
accusers, could not be suffered by the King to make any replye, but within
three day^s they must depart, which so danted the Duke and young Rosilius, that
they stood like those men that Perseus turned to stones, and poor Melissa
sorrowing at the hard censure of the King, and weeping at the mishap of her
Father, cried ^ut against Fortune that was so fickle, and the stars that ^ad
so badlye dealt in the configuration of their natiuiti^, seeing her sorrow with
tears, and her Fortunes with wa^ings: well to be brief, the day came of their
departure, the Duke with Rosilius and Melissa were embarked in a little Ship,
and so transported into Libia, where when they arrived, the Du^e for that he
had small acquaintance or none in the Country, lived obscurely and in poor
estate: the clown Rosilius having no quallities of the mind, on^lye at h^m^
relying upon his revenues, and now abroad driven to satisfy his thirst with
his hands, and to relieve his hunger with applying himself to any servile kind
of drudgerie: Melissa she got her self into the service of a rich merchant,
where with such court^sie she behaved her self, that she was generally liked
of all the household: while thus th^se three pilgrims lived in this penance,
Bradamant hearing of this strange accident, fell into diverse and ^undry
perplexed passions^ First the fervent affection he bare unto Melissa, told him
that Fortune may not part lovers, nor the inconstant constellation of the
planets, disseuer that which Fan^ ye had united with such a band, that the
vows of Venus are not to be violated: that love must resemble a cyrcle, whose
motion never cease in that round, therefore he was bound by love and duty,
to sail after them into Lybia, and there to give what relief he could to
these exiles: but to these resolutions came strange and contrary motions: First
the forsaking of his Father whom he most reverently honored: secondly his
friends, whom in all duty he did reverence, but that which pained him most,
was to leave Egypt his country, which he loved more then his life, in so much
that with Ulysses he counted the smoke of Ithaca sweeter then the f^ers of
Troie, these considerations drew him from his resolution of departure, so that
he stayed for two or three days passionate in Aegipt but love that is
restless suffered him to take no rest, but in his dreams presented him with
the shape of Melissa, and waking, Fancy set so plainly the Idea of her person
and perfection before his eyes, that as one tormented with a second hell,
neither respecting father, country, nor friends, as soon as wind and weather
did serve, rigging a bonny Bark to the Sea, he passed into Lib^a, where he was
no sooner arrived, but straight ^ee highed him to the Court, where then
Sacrapant the king of that land kept his palace royal, Bradamant living there
for a space as a courtier, won such ^auour for his excellent wit and rare
qualities, that the king held him as one of his chief gentl^men, and promoted
him with great gifts, in so much that who but Bradamant in all the Court of
Libia, flowrisht thus in great credit, he sought about to find out the Duke
and his daughter, him on a day as he passed down to y^ sea Cliffes he found
gathering of Cockles, professing the state of a Fisherman: with whom, after he
had parted a little, he bewrayed what he was, and in what estimation he was with
Sacrapant: the Duke glad to see one of his countrymen, and neighbors in so
strange a land embraced him, to whom Bradamant briefly discoursed his mind as
concerning ye imperf^ctions of Rosilius how his wealth only r^sp^cted, whereof
now he was d^pryued, he was a mere pleasant and slave of nature, not able,
being exil^ though noble borne, to show any sparks of honor: seeing then the
Duke was tied to extremities he would now mary his daughter, and make her live
as her calling deserved in the Court: Gradasso no sooner heard his mind, but
he granted to his motion, so that Bradamant breaking the matter to the king
Sacrapant with all his Lords seeing the Damzell so fair condiscended, and
with great pomp solempnised the Nuptials, where Bradamant mainteyned his wife
and his father very richly until Pharao dying, the duke Bradamant and his wife
Meli^sa with the clowni^h Lord Rosilius passed home to their former
Possessions: Perimedes having told his tale, he brust forth into these
speeches: Thou see Delia how far wit is preferred before wealth, and in
what estimation the qualities of the mind are in respect of worldly
Possessions: Archimedes having suffered Shipwreck on the Sea being cast on
shore all the rest of the passengers sorrowing because their goods were lost,
he ^spying certain Geometrical Caracters, merrily and cheerfully said vnt^
them, Fear not fellow-mates in misfortune, for I see the steps of men, and so
passed: but when he was known among them, the Philosophers relieved them all.
Least Perimedes should have gone forward in his discourse, one of his
neighbors came in to bear him company, and so he ceast from his pratle.

If the rest of their discourse happen into my hands, then Gentlemen look for
News.

William Bubb Gentleman, to his friend the Author.
AFter that friend R^bin you had finished Perymedes, and vouchsafed to commit
it to my vewe, liking the work, ^^d so much the rather, for that you bestowed
the Dedication on my very good friend Master Geruis Clifton, whose deserts
merit it (and one of more worth) when your labor shall be employed more
seriously: the last sheet hanging in the Press, coming into your study, I
found in your Deske certain Sonets, fained to be written by the Caldees, what
time the poor Smith and his wife lived so contentedlye, which she having kept
as jewels in her Chest, and you as relikes in your Chamber, not letting any but
your familiars to peruse them, for that you feared to discover your little
skill in verse: these Sonets for that they fit my humor, and will content
others, or else my judgment fails, I charge thee by that familiar conuersing
that has past between us, that thou annex them to the end of this Pamphlet,
which if you grant, we still rest as we have been, if not, Actum est de
amicitia, and so farewell.

Thine William Bubb.

The Author.
BEing Gentlemen thus strictly coniured by mine especial good friend, I dare
not but rather hazard my credit on your courtesies then loose for so small a
trifle his freendship whom I have ever found as faithful as familiar, and so
familiar as can come within the compass of amity: then I humbly entreat, if
my verses be harse, or want the grace that Poems should have, that you will
ouershadow them with your favors, and pardon all, the rather for that I
present them upon constraint: if in this your courtesies shall friend me, I
will either labor to have better skill in Poetry, or else swear never to
write any more, and so I heartily bid you farewell.

WHen the Caldees ruled in Egypt, as the Gimnosophists did in India, and the
Sophi in Greece, they used to endeavor as far as their grave counsels could
prevail, to suppress all wanton affections, respecting not the degrees of
persons, to whom they delivered their satyricall exhortations: it chanced
therefore, that Psamnetichus yoongest son, addicted to much to wanton desires,
and to sot himself in the beauty of women: one of the Caldees having an
insight into his lascivious life, persuaded him to desist from such fading
pleasures, whose momentarye delights did breed lasting reproach and infamy:
the young Prince making light account of his words, went into his Study, and
writ him an answer Sonnet-wise, to this effect:

I am but young and may be wanton yet.

IN Cypres sat fair Venus by a Fou^t,
Wanton Adonis toying on her knee,
She kissed the wag, her darling of account,
The Boie began blush, which when his lover see,
She smild and told him love might challenge debt,
And he was young and might be wanton yet.
The boy waxt bold fiered by fond desire,
That woe he could, and court her with conceit,
Reason spied this, and sought to quench the fire
With cold disdain, but wily Adon straight
Cherd up the flame and said good sir what let,
I am but young and may be wanton yet.
Reason replied that Beawty was a bane
To such as feed their fancy with fond love,
That when sweet youth with lust is ouertane,
It rues in age, this could not Adon move,
For Venus taught him still this rest to set
That he was young, and might be wanton yet.
Where Venus strikes with Beauty to the quick,
It little vayles sage reason to reply:
Few are the cares for such as are love sick
But love: then though I wanton it awry
And play the wag: from Adon this I get,
I am but young and may be wanton yet.
After the young Prince had ended his sonnet and given it as it were in
derysion to the Caldee, the old man willing to give him a Sop of the same
saw^e, called together his wyts, and refelled his reason thus, after his own
method: The Siren Venus nourist in her lap
Fair Adon, swearing whiles he was a youth
He might be wanton: Note his after-hap
The guerdon that such lawless lust ensues,
So long he followed flattering Venus lore,
T^ll seely Lad, he perished by a bore.
Mars in his youth did court this lusty dame
He won her love, what might his fancy let
He was but young: at last unto his shame
Vulcan intrapt them slily in a net,
And called the Gods to witness as a truth,
A leachers fault was not excused by youth.
If crooked Age accounts youth his spring;
The Spring, the fairest season of the year,
Enricht with flowers and sweetes, and many a thing
That fair and gorgeous to the eyes appear:
It fits that youth the spring of man should be,
Richt with such flowers as virtue yields thee.


After that the old Caldee had penned this Poem, he presented it to the
young Prince, but how it took effect I little know, and leave you to suppose:
but this I am sure, Delia kept it in her Casket as a Relick: and therefore as I
had it I present it.

This Sonnet had no name prefixed, so that I know^ not whose invention it was:
but Delia held it more dear then all the rest, so that before she drew it out
off her Box she praised it with many protestations: but as the Argument may
infer conjecture, it was done by a Lover, whose Mistress was hard-hearted:
which he dys^^uered Metaphorically and myldly: Thus: Fair ^s my love for
April in her face,
Her lovely breasts September claims his part,
And Lordly July in her eyes takes place,
But col^e December dwells in her heart:
Blessed be the months, that sets my thoughts on fire,
Accursed that Month that hinders my desire.
Like Phoebus ^ire, so sparkles both her eyes,
As air perfumde with Amber is her breath:
Like swelling waves her lovely teates do rise,
As earth her heart, cold, dateth me to death.
Ave me poor man that on the earth do live,
When unkind earth, death and despair does give.
In pomp sits Mercy seated in her face,
Love twixt her breasts his tro^hees does imprint.
Her eyes shines favor, courtesy, and grace:
But touch her heart, ah that is framd of flynt;
That fore my harvest in the Grass bears grain,
The rockt will wear, washed with a winters rai^e.


This read over, she clapped it into her casket, and brought out an old rustie
paper, and with that she smyled on h^er hus^and, and spoke to her neighbor
^itting by, I will tell you Gossip (quoth she) as preciselye as my husband
sits, he has been a wag, but now age has plucked out all his Coltes teeth:
for when he and I made love one to another, he got a learned clarke to write
this dittie, subtly contrived as though it (...) be^ne between Sheepheards,
but he meant it of me and him^selfe: Perymedes laughed at this, and so the Sonnet
was read thus: PHillis kept sheep along the western plains,
And Coridon did feed his flocks hard by
This Shepherd was the flower of all the swains,
That traced the downs of fruit^ull Thessalie,
And Phillis that did far her flocks surpass,
In silver hu^ was thought a bonny las^e.
A Bonny less quaint in her Country tire,
Was lovely Phillis, Coridon swore so:
Her locks, her looks, did set the swain on fire,
He left his Lambs, and he began to w^e,
He looked, he sithi, he courted with a kisse^
No better could the silly ^wad then this.
He little knew to paint a tale of Love,
Sheepheards can fancy, but they cannot saye^
Phillis began smile, and wily thought to prove,
What uncouth gree^e poor Coridon did pay,
She asked him how his flocks or he did fare,
Yet pensive thus his sighs did tell his care.
The Shepherd blushed when Phillis ques^ioned so,
And swore by Pan it was not for his ^^ocke:
It Is love fair Phillis breeds all this woe:
My thoughts are trapt within thy lovely locks,
Thine eye has pearst, thy face has set on fire.
Fair Phillis kin^leth Coridons desire.
Can Sheepheards love, said Phillis to the swain,
Such saints as Phillis, Coridon replied:
Men when they lust, can many ^ancies feign,
Said Phillis: this not Corido^ denied:
That lust had lies, but love quoth he says truth,
Thy Shepherd loves, then Phillis what ensues.
Phillis was wan, she blushed and hung the head,
The swain stepped to, and cher'd her with a kiss,
With faith, with troth, they stroke the matter dead,
So used they when men thought not amiss:
This Love begun and ended both in one,
Phillis was loved, and she liked Corydon.


And thus Gentlemen at my friends request I have put in print those bad
Sonnets, which otherwise I had resolved to have made obscure, like the pictures
that Phidius drew in his prentize-hood, which he painted in the night and
blotted out in the day: if they pass but with silence, howsoever you smyle at
them secretly, I care not if they be so ill that you cannot but murmur openly
at such trash: I run to the last clause of my friends letter: do this: Aut
actum est de amicitia: and so I bid you farewell.

FINIS.
