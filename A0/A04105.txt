Of the horyble and woeful destruction of Jerusalem And of the signs and tokens
that were seen before it was destroyed: which destruction was after Christ's
assension.xlii. years.
To the tune of the Queens Almayne.
AN Emperor Vaspasian
Some time in Rome there was,
Through whom much dolors then began
Of mortal wars alas,
With in two years that he did rain
He put the Jews to myckill pain
With fire and sword both take and slain,
His power brought so to pass,
His Sone Tytus having no dread
His army over Iudae spread
The people to the City flead
Hoping to have redress.
Before Titus Vaspasians son
Unto this wars did goo
Was after Cristes assencion,
Long.xl. years and two
Then did the Romans with such pride
Be set their land both far and wide,
And hemd them in, on every side
To their great pain and woe,
They brought the Jews in such a case
The prophesye, to bring to pass,
Spoke by our Lord when he here was
The scripture does say so.
That prudent Jew Josephus says
Who did no write in vain,
That he was present in those days
And saw this mortal pain,
When that Tytus both bold and stout
Be set Jerusalem a bout,
That none might in, nor Issue out,
No way but to be slain.
For Tytus his chyef capteyn was
The seige when he had brought to pass
Great was the cry woe and alas,
The story does say plain.
He stopped their pypes and Conduyts all,
That no water might pass:
With famyne they were in great thrall,
Most woeful was their case,
They were constraynyd in such need
With Horse, and Ass, them selves to feed
Both Dog, and Catte, this do I reed
Most ougle meat it was,
The honger there it was so great,
Ones vomit was another meat
There was no way for to entreat
But present death alas.
Six mounthes the siege it did hold on
A bout that City great,
Whearin was many a mothers son
Did starve for lack of meat,
The famous Ladies of that town
That wear before of hie renown,
For fault of food fell in a sown
There was nothing to geate:
The storye this does specify,
The mothers most unnaturally,
They slew their Children rufully,
And Rostyd them to eat.
This Titus then of hye renown
Most valyently and bold,
The walls so strong he did cast down
Resystaunce waxyd cold,
The people in the streets lay dead,
They had no Succor drynk nor bread
Much was the blood that then was shead,
Alas lament we should:
The Romans entered with such might,
With Polare, spears, and swerdes so bright
They slew all that came in their sight
No mercy they did hold.
The Gates that covered were with gold
They threw them to the ground,
That famous City to behold
For sin it was confound,
A leven honderid thowsande slain
Through honger, sword and pestelent pain
In this the story does not feign,
Of many a blooddy wound,
The stink of carkas in the street,
The feeble souls that could not fleet
For faint with honger skarce could creep,
Full heavy was their sound.
Then Titus gave this sentence bliue
Which Romans lykyd well,
As many as you find a live,
After this Rate them sell,
As Crist was sold for thyrtye pence,
By Judas and his false pretense,
So Titus made their recompense
The story this does tell,
XXX. Jews for a penie bougt,
As many more were sold for naught
There own confusion thus was wrought
Because they did rebel.
And many prisoners mo I ween
To Egypt they wear send,
Fowerscore thousand, and seventeen
In prison all their end,
And Titus in his company
Took many such as were worthy,
And lead them bound all captiuelie,
To Rome with him to wend:
There was no help for to revoke,
As Ihosephus says in his book
His Chronicles who list to look,
On truth they do depend.
Thirty years God gave them space
That they might yet repent,
Their lives amend and call for grace
For them Christ did lament,
This louinge Lord often did them call
By sundry signs as hear you shall
Before his wrath on them did fall
Or anger fully bent,
Twelve days eclipsed was the moon,
That they might be converted soon,
But they wist not what to be done,
But sin still did augment.
Before the seige or any war,
the space of all one year
Over that town was seen a star,
Most blasinge bright and clear
So like a sword in shape it was,
Where at great fear and wonder was,
Yet left they not their wickedness,
when these signs did appear:
More over in the air so light,
In plate of maile and armore bright,
Were seen men ready for to fight,
To show their time was near.
A festifall day, in Apriell,
To halowe they were dight,
And suddenly amongst them fell
A merueylous strange light,
So bright and clear with such aleame,
Passing the son as it did seem,
But what it meant no man could deem.
But were all in sore flight
And while the pristes did this in dure
To offer a Calfe they did their cure,
Which Calfe a thing against nature,
Brought forth a Lamb in sight.
Such many tokens contrary
Which does Prognostikate,
And to the Jews did signify
Their woeful fall and fate,
Before that Titus war began
Four years of space, this prove I can,
How that the son of one rude man,
Ananias low of state,
He ran the streates in such a rage
Being a child of tender age,
To call and cry he did not swage
Repent ear it be late.
But for his pains he was well beat
This had he for his hire,
For truth they did him evil in treat
Against him did conspire,
But yet he cried and would not blen,
While he was able yet to ren,
Saying woe be to Jerusalem,
For kindling of Gods ire:
Woe be to thee and to thy land
Thou art be set in woeful band,
Thy days of sorrow is at hand
Of famine swerd and fire.
This was that famous City then
Distroyed with fire and sword,
That mighty town Jerusalem,
The City of the Lord:
Because their God they would not know
Christ being.xxx. years below
His word to them plainly did show
This scripture does record,
That they might be his chosen first
To live and reign a among the just,
And to no other for to trust
But to belyue his word.
Now saying that this Jerusalem,
As scripture does tell true
Was plaguyd for the sins of men,
Which Romans over threw,
What shall that Lord to us express
That so does live in such excess,
Of whordome, Pride, and couitousnes
More now then did the Jew,
Therefore is our example this,
A mend the thing that is a mysse
That we may have eternal bliss,
By Christ our Lord Iesue.
