PROPOSITION Of the Ambassador PECKIVS. In the Congregation of the General
States.
NOBLE and MIGHTY LORDS, These latter days of the Truce of twelf years of the
Low Countries / our common Fatherland / do set before our eyes the lamentable
mutation commonly following after such temporal Agreements / and whereof the
preparations on both sides are promooved and advaunced already. But the
Archidukes looking with a pitiful eye upon the extreme and most deplorable
Inconveniences and miseries / wherein this Lands thorough / this mutation
should come to fall / could not choose to bring into great consideration the
means fit / expedient and required to the preventing and averting of them /
specially beeinge moved to this healthful and salutary sentence / thorough
their natural inclination to Peace / and thorough their zeal and affection to
the commune wealth / which likewise has been the cheifest and principal
motives / that their Highnesses have resolved to the said Truce / as a
beginning of the whole desired tranquillity and rest / and of the Quenching of
the Flame of war / wherein at their cominge they found these Lands / thinking
that within the time of the same Truce / there actions have klearly and
manifestly testified and declared the surety of their good intention / and for
this future time their Highnesses have nothing more carefully beharted / then
to procure the greatest advantage of these Lands in General / which seems to
consiste therein that all the Parts and Members of the Low Countries should
gather in one body and under one head / being apparent / that as they where
before the troubles in peaceable union and quiet prosperity / they should yet
more use and enjoy the same if the Provinces of this side / would consent to a
good / and firm Agreement with acknowledge of their Natural Princes. This is
the Poinct that their Highnesses have charged me to declare unto your
Mightinesses and freendly to present / supposing that it was their duty and
required office of good Princes before all breaches of war / seeking and
beharting your own continual welfare and prosperity / and that consideration
should be taken of it / with a fruitful resolution / by which all sheading of
blood / exceeding chardges and other lamentable miseries (whereunto this Low
Countries have been subject so many years) once might be avoided: And if your
Mightinesses would come / upon this condition to a communication of Agreement /
their Highnesses shall incline to such reosonnable conditions and capitulations
/ that the same your High Mightinesses shall have full reason of good
contentement / and see not only the affections of the good will of their
Highnesses / but eke the equity and sincerity / which always they have had
in sundry recommendation / and manifestly declared hitherto by the punctuel and
religious keeping of all their actions and promises / as that same sufficiently
may be trusted unto them: Assuring your High Mightinesses likewise of the like
good and sincere intention of the Catholic Majesty / and that the same shall
have for good / firm and acceptable / what their Highnesses concerning this
cause shall do and conclude.

ANSWER Upon the said Proposition / of the said High / Mighty Lords the States
of the United Low Countries.
THe General States of the United Low Countries having heard and througly
examined the Proposition from the Part of the Archidukes / in the Congregation
of their High Mightinesses / first verbolly done / and thereafter delivered in
writing by the Lord Petro Peckio Knight of Bouchoute / Canceler of Brabant / by
power of Lettres of Credencie of the said Archidukes / dated in Brussel the 16
of this Month. Declare that the Highness and Souveraigntie of the United Low
Countries is sure / and with out any contraversy by their High Mightinesses /
and by the States of the Respective Provinces / that they have maintained
always religiously the same / against al those that would bring it in doubt /
or to undertake any thing against the same / or appropriate it to any other
Princes / and consequently that they never would come to any treatises or
agreeme^ts / wheere by the same should have been brought in any doubt /
whereof they have given expres declaration to the Emperor / Electours and
Princes / and other Potentates / and likewise to the said Archidukes / that the
State of their High Mightinesses is holden Souverain / and their Lands for free
Lands acknowledged and accepted by the greatest Monarchs / Kings / Potentates
and Republiques / who all / in the same quality / have made with their High.
Migh. sundry treatises / and Confederations / having likewise maintained it so
far / that their High Mightinesses / nor with the said Archiduke / nor with
the King of Spain / would not undertake any Agreement / before the same had
given an act of Declaration of it / that they did handle with the same their
High Mightinesses / as with free Lands and Provinces whereupon they had nothing
to pretend: And because that same is as kleare as the Noonedaye / and
manifestly known to all the world / therefore their High Mightinesses hold
very strange the Proposition of the Lord Chanceler PECKIO, declaringe that the
greatest advantage of these Lands should consiste therein / that all the Parts
and members of the Low Countries should gather in one body and under one Head
/ and that they would consent to a good and Firm Agreement with acknow: of
their natural Princes / if the same lands upon this condition would come to a
communicatio^ of Agreement / that their Hignesses should incline to reasonnable
conditions: Because the same Condition could not serve to preventinge and
aboydinge of the extreme inconveniences / wherein the Lands thorough the
wars again should come to fall / whereunto the Proposition seems to
stretche / but rather shall kindle the fire of war / because it goes directly
against the said confessed souveraigntie and Highness of the Lands / which
their High Might: hitherto so laudably / and with so difficile wars have
maintained / and further / with the help of God / are resolved to maintain
with goods and blood. And likewise that the said Proposition is replenished
with errors and not tolerable in their state / drawinge in dispute the same
souveraigntie against the Fondementale Laws of this State. And therefore their
High Might: kan not allow such an unjust / anlooked / and unneygbourly
Proposition nor approove the same / as implikinge an intolerable atrocite
against their state / and to great dishonor of al Monarchs / Kings /
Potentates / and Republiques / who have handled with them as with a Souveraine
State. But must and necessarely declare / that all they / which by any
Propositions or other means / presume to draw into dispute the Souverayne
Right of these lands / or to impugn the same / or to appropriate it to any
other Princes / or any thing that favored of it / shall be holden and keept
as inhabil to be admitted by their High. Might: to any Treatise. And this they
give the said Lord Peckio for answer / only adding / that the said Archidukes
/ by the manifold complainctes done unto them / and whereupon no satisfaction
is done / know sufficiently / how their High. Mightines understande that the
Treatise of Truce poinctly and regiliously by them and the King of Spain
should be keept. Actum in the congregation of the said General States in the
Hague the 25. of March. 1621. And was paragraphed.
