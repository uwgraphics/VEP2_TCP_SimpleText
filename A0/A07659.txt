A DECLARATION OF THE PROTESTATION OF MONseigneur the Marshall d'Anuille.
WE Henry of Monmorency, Lord of Danuille Marshall of France, Gouerner and
Lieutenaunt general for the King, in the country of Languedoc, Desiring that
every man may know and understand, that the only duty and fidelity that
we have borne to the service of his Majesty, and to the profit and quiet of
his subjects and of his Realm, has moved us to enter into arms against the
disturbers and oppressers thereof. For this cause do declare to all Kings,
Princes, and Pote^tates of Christendom, friends confederates, and allies of
his Crown, and to all his Majesty's faithful subjects of what estate,
quality, or condition soever they be, that having perceived these fourtene
year past, and from shortly after the decesse of the late King Henry of good
memory, how this poor and desolate Realm has in all sorts been afflicted
and oppressed with civil wars, grounded upon the pretense and controversy
of Religion, and how under this pretense has followed the total ruin of the
more part of the good Towns that have been spoiled and sacked, and some of
them ofter than once, as the disordred and insatiable passion of such as were
the authors of all these miseries has had will to entreprise and put in
execution: how the edictes and ordinances made at the general assembly of the
Estates at Orleans, and since that time so often renewed, as well for the
pacification of the Realm, as for the governance thereof, have in all things
ben periurously broken: how impunitie of murders, slaughters, poysonninges,
raysinges of tumoltes of the people, defilinges of women, and maids,
burninges, sackinges, and other heinous doings, generally have been, and be
tolerated in this Realm, by those that ought to have stayed the same, even so
far as that they have suffered that cruel barbarous, and unnatural murder of
the more part of the Nobility of France committed in the town of Parise, on
saint Barthelmewes day, in the year 1572. how poor prisonners and persons
errested in form of law, within the concergeries of the Palace of Parise
aforesaid, of Tolouse, Bordeaux, Roane, Lion, and Orleans, and other Towns
have been burned, slain and murdered, beside an infinity number of persons
of good estate, women, children, and other citezens of the said towns, and
also their goods rauenously spoiled by these that are at this day honored,
favored, and auaunced.

How the King and his Realm are still possessed, as they have been in the time
of the late Kings his brethren, by strangers which have conspired to the
total subversion of his Majesty, the Princes of his blood, and his Nobility,
as they have sufficiently made appear by putting them to the assaults of
towns, to combats, and other hasardes at their pleasure, to the intent
utterly to deface the memory and wholly to usurp the estate and crown of
France.

How since the decesse of the good King Henry, the Nobility has been wholly
defaced in France, and their merits and virtues despised: how strangers have been preferred before them to the charges and estates of the Crown, and of the
Kings household, against the ancient laws of the establishme^t of this
Realm. Yea and which more is, the said estates have been given to some that be
no ge^tlemen, nor have showed so much, as any small proof of any thing nere to
any deserving of such charge. Whereof ensues an extreme grefe to an infinite
number of old Knights and Capitaines of France, in respect of the long
services of their auncesters, and which themselves have not spared their
lives, their goods, their children, their kindred and their friends, and all
that they had, for the service of the King, and for the maintenance of his
estate. So as brefely the country of the world that most plentuously
furnished good examples to all other, is now so disordered and defiled, that in
steed of recovering the ancient virtues that in time past there abounded in
all things, now no man can otherwise judge, but that the desolations and
calamities, which we have suffered, have directly proceeded from the wrath of
God, wholly powered out upon the people of France, by the subversion, which
these strangers the gouerners of the Estate have brought in, and for lack of
observing the order and the rule, which of ancient time have been so well
established, as no province was comparable to ours, like as while the policy
thereof was inueolably kept, it has flourished and ben renomed above all other
nations, and since the disorder and subversion have been brought in by these
new gouerners with their novelties, they have sought to make the Kings
subjects live like brute beasts, without doctrine, or observing of any thing
that they ought, depriving them of such learned men as were in the
Universities, either by murder, or banishement into strange countries,
permitting that the Ecclesiastical persons (from whom ought to proceed to us
the principal examples) neither study, nor preach, nor be resident, nor
exercising themselves in any part of their duty, that their insatiable
couetise in their plurality of benefices has free course than ever it had,
that the poor, the needy, and the orphane be wholly forsaken: and all other
works of charity, are by the said Ecclesiastical persons wholly rejected
and eloigned: how they let out their benefices to ferme, not caryng to whom,
and by the same mean do in their absence leave the charge of their own
souls, and of their flock as it were to fermers and tenantes: and chefly how
the elections ordained by the holy Counselles, and confirmed by the said
ordinances of Orleans, have been repelled and revoked for the private profit of
strangers, which have been, and be such as hardly they might be capable to be
called by the people of France, to any charges and dignities spiritual or
temporal.

How since that justice is administered for money, and that there has been
suffered in France against our laws, that the president Biragne a Millanois,
has been made Chaunceller of France, and that all the learned and sufficient
Frenchmen that might have been chosen to those charges have been rejected, we
have had nothing but meschef in justice, and allowance of all the murders,
slaughters, and traitorous outrages that have been executed and conspired,
since he has been in charge: brefely how all his edictes have tended only to
the subversion of the Nobility and of the crown of France, both in depriuyng
them of the liberties, in erection of offices, and in new tributes and
ungracious inventions that he has devised with certain other strangers his
ministers, to praue the substance of Frenchemen, to maintain (as he has done
hitherto) a division and confusion among them, and in the same to gather and
maintain arms levied for the execution of his practices, by which means he
has done what in him lay to create a stranger the Kings Lieutenant general
in his Realm, disapointing my Lord his Majesty's brother of the promise that
was made him by the late King, by occasion whereof and of the discontentmente
that my said Lord gave, to wite, that he conceived thereby, he is at this day
as captive, and all those that were thought affectioned to the service of the
King, and to maintain that which justly belonged unto him, and to my said
Lord his brother, or which have bent themselves against this tyranny,
oppression, and evil counsel, as well Princes of the blood, and officers of
his Majesty's crown, as other, have been put to death, exiled, or be detained
prisoners.

Having be on all that they were able, under false and sclanderous persuasions,
in the same time of the others emprisonemente, they have practiced to cause us
to be slain by the Count Martinnengues, and diverse other expressly sent to
this town of Montpellier to make us to be prisoned, or to be murdered in a
tumulte of the people (a thing so commonly known as every man can depose it)
howbeit this is a particular matter where with we will not now entermedle,
dealing only with the general, and referryng this to time and place for us
convenient, to debate this cause and all the rest concerning us, and to make it
known to his Majesty that without just occasion, this mischeuous treason and
conspiracy has been attempted.

Now we having lately iorneyed into Piedmont, to his Majesty's presence (by his
commandment, at such time as he returned from Poloigne into his own Realm)
to understand his good pleasure, and to give him advise, as he required us by
writing from Venize, of the means that then were to appease the troubles of
his Realm, according to his inclination to so good intent by himself
sufficiently published, and made known to his subjects, and to Princes and
Potentates strangers and his allies, his Majesty had diverse times done us so
great honor, to assure us of this his so sincere and laudable intention, to
enter with peace, and to embrace the unity of his said subjects of both
Religions, to make them partakers of the benefit and quietness that he meant
to them, in such sort that we looked for nothing, but this universal good at
our return from the town of Suze to this our government, there to attend (as
his Majesty had expressly commanded us for these, whom it should please him
to send to assist us, and to seek the means of the said pacification. But he
being still in the power of those that had counseled the late King, to the
oppression and ruin of his Estates, hindering the fruit of his good purpose,
they have contemned as they yet daily do continue, the execution of their
practices and devises, consuming wholly the finaunces of France in the
entertening of an army in a manner all of strangers, as Suyssers, Reisters,
and Piedmontois. One part of which army is co^ducted into this country of
Languedoc by the lord d'Vzes, a man known among Frenchemen for one that under
color of the Religion reformed, which he fained himself to follow in times
past, has ruined, spoiled, and sacked all the good towns of this country,
defaced and beaten down all the fair monasteries, and Churches cathedral and
collegiate, and taken and robbed the iewelles that were in them, which now
failing him, therewith also have failed his religion and godliness that he
pretended to embrase, and also the cruel and miserable death of the lord of
Bodinay his brother: and he has accepted this charge to the intent to continue
with these oppressers and disturbers of France the ruin thereof.

On the other side, into Prouence is conducted a part of the said army by the
Marshall of Gondy, a stranger to this Realm, to whom this charge (as it is
easy to perceive) has been committed for the distrust that has been had of
those of that contreye, which would be executioners of so mischeuous purposes
for the subversion of the same.

Whereupon having been made to us sundry declarations and exhortations, as well
on the behalf of the Princes of the blood, officers of the Crown, and Pairs of
France, as also of all the provinces of this Realm, which know the imminent
destruction of the King and of his estate at hand, if necessary remedy
thereto be not spedily provided. We as an officer of the Crown, a natural
Frencheman, and descended of the first Christians and barons of France, which
from time beyond all memory have had before their eyes in singular
recommandation the protection, preservation, and defense of their Kings and
their Crowns, which we desire by the help of God, to follow in all that we
possibly may:

Having well considered that the controversy which is in this Realm for matter
of Religion, neither can nor ought to be determined by arms, but by a holy and
free counsel general or national, and likewise that it is most requisite that
there be an establishment of all things in their first estate, by the advice
and deliberation of an assembly of the states general, the only remedy to
appease troubles, and the only pillar and upholding of the King and of his
Crown, whatsoever the tyrants, flatterers, and clokers of truth can say to
the contrary.

We having an extreme greef to see his Majesty possessed, by persons that
have so small regard unto him, that they publicly abuse his sacred name, to
cover their ungracious intention, insatiableness and ambition, Have embrased
the common protection, preservation and defense of the Crown, and of the said
good and natural subjects, as well of the one Religion as of the other, of
what quality or condition soever they be, against the said strangers, evil
counsels, oppressers and violaters of the unity and common quiet of this said
Realm, and of the liberty of my Lord the Kings brother, the King of Navarre,
my Lord the prince of Conde, and other Princes of the blood, officers of the
Crown, Lords, Gentlemen, and other Capitaines prisoners and exiled, as is
aforesaid.

Calling to our succor and aid all Kings Princes, and Potentates of
Christendom, friends and confederates of this Crown, and all the faithful
subjects of the same, hoping that God will give us the grace by arms to come
to a good accord of Religion, to the unity and restoring of this Realm in the
former estate, by the determination of a holy and free counsel general or
national, and by the deliberation and advise of the general assembly of the
estates of France.

We notify to all the said subjects of his Majesty, of what estate,
condition or quality soever they be, to all the Provinces, Towns, and
Commonalties of this Realm, that will favor, aid, and assist us in this so
good, so just, and so virtuous enterprise, for the public weal of his said
Majesty, and of all his Realm, that they shall be pre served, maintened, and
kept in all liberties of their conscience, exercise of their Religion, as well
Catholics as Reformed, according as shall be particularly advised at this next
assembly general, by us assigned in this town of Montpellier, and in the full
and free enioyyng of their dignities, estates, goods fruits, revenues, and
profits, as well Ecclesiastical as other, without exception of any whatsoever,
and from this time as also from thenceforthe we have taken and do take and
admit them under the Kings and our protection and safeguard. As also we declare
that they which shall show themselves contrary to us, and our commandments
to the purpose above said, shall be run upon as enemies of the estate and
crown of France, and disturbers of the unity and common peace.

At Montpellier 1575.
The blood of our brethren cries out of the earth.
