Your Loving Kinseman, Richard Milton.

Londons Misery, The Countries Cruelty, with Gods Mercy.
NO far fetched Story brought from Foreign land,
Or such like matters do I take in hand;
No love sick Sonnet, or sweet roundelayes,
No Epigrams or such like pleasing toys,
Nor do I write the deeds of Martial men,
That have bin done the place, time, where and when:
This I refer unto some other men,
To paint and set forth with their fluent pen:
Whilst I with sighing do most sadly sing,
The fearful judgments of the Heavenly King,
That in his wrath by his most heavy hand,
Puts to amazement this most sinful Land;
A task too hard for me, whose slender skill,
Is far unfit, although Gods knows my will,
Be very good for matter it befits,
The industrious penning of more curious wits:
My wit is mean, God knows, I understand
But little, and for me to take in hand
This worthy work, I might presume too much
To meddle with; for answer unto such
Shall so oppose me, this poor simple skill
I here have shown, is meant by me no ill
In any kind, but only for to show,
The good affection I o^ duty owe
Unto this City, (where I have my being)
Whose great calamities I daily seeing,
Makes me break forth, and with a grieved soul,
Her miserable state for to condole,
Amongst the rest, should I not be unkind?
As not to show grief where such cause I find
In th'ighest manner, to a place I love so,
As none in earth more dearer, surely no;
But in this Action will be so far bold,
Not fearing what I write shall be controld.
ANd first to thee Lord, do I humbly bow,
For pardon for our sins, whose angry brow,
Still Frowns as if no mercy thou will have
Upon this City, but will send to Grave
All the inhabitants within a little space,
Oh be not angry still, afford us grace
For to repent, and stay thine angry hand,
For who thy powerful judgments can withstand:
Lord we have sinned and have done amiss,
Wherefore thine anger fiercely kindled is:
Upon this City vengeance thou have powered,
And we like sheep to slaughter are devoured:
Our sins forgive, behold our watrie eyes,
Our grievous groans, our lamentable cries;
Long have we fighed, but thou have not heard,
Often have we prayed, but thou have not spared,
As if even with our prayers thou were offended,
As if thy judgments never would be ended.
Faintness possesses all our vital parts,
Our courage fails us, daunted are our hearts:
In this extremity, whether shall we fly,
But unto thee oh God, prostrate we lie,
Before thy Throne of grace, and with bleeding wound,
And sobbing sighs, our miseries we sound:
Do we not know Lord thou did fend thy Son,
To pay a ransom for our deeds mis-done,
Even from the Heavens, where thou sies above,
So dear the life of sinners thou did love:
And when by our transgression, mankind all,
Were subject to thy wrath, fast bound and thrall;
And we believe, Lord help our unbelief,
For of the same thou art our stay and chief
Prop and vpholder, we believe I say,
For on so sure a ground safe build we may:
What thou have promisde in thy sacred Word,
What thou have vowed, oh most gracious Lord,
That thou the death of sinners not desire,
But rather life to them, for thou requirest,
That of their sinful lives, they would amend,
And so gain mercy where they did offend:
With patience therefore we attend thy will,
Not doubting but thy words thou will fulfill.
It Is not unknown to many a Foreign Nation,
The beauty of London, and the situation,
The strength, the wealth and multitude of men
It did contain, at such good time as when,
God was at peace with us, the Famous Sparks
Of sweet invention, and the learned Clerks,
Worthy Divines and Physicians store,
Attournes, Counselors and penmen more
I think then need is, there the reverend Judges
Gave many a sentence, at which ill men grudges,
For there the Courts of justice have bin kept,
Where many a Client has full sorely wept.
The cause is known to God, what shall I say,
That to this City in some sort I may
Express good will, there 'twas the liberal Arts
Did chiefly flourish, men of excellent parts
Did there abide, as being the very Spring,
That to their Studies sweet refresh did bring.
There lived our King, also his noble Peers,
To whom the Lord grant life and many years,
Of happiness on earth, fame and renown,
And in the end an everlasting Crown
Of glory, there his Subjects at command,
In multitude were like unto the sand,
That on the Sea shore, Sea men use to see,
When waves are past, and waters calmed be:
The several sorts of Tradesmen and of Arts,
The several merchandise from Foreign parts,
The multitude of rich and wealthy men,
I am not able to express with pen;
And though for four years past, it so fell out
That many Tradesmen here, were in great doubt
They should have bin undone, (for trading failed,
And so long time their hearts were cold and quaild)
Yet the late marriage of our Royal King,
We thought a settling to this Realm would bring,
In such a wise, that now our fear was past,
And well was he that did hold out till last,
That all men so with doings should abound,
That worke-men for our work would nere be found,
Oh God, how of our hopes we are deceived,
And of our long expected joys bereaved,
How thou our foolish wisdom sets at naught,
And even our selves unto destruction brought,
Vain is the help of man, also are vain
The imagination of a mortal brain;
Oh London, London, thou did feel the Rod,
But never rightly looked up to thy God
That struck thee with it, when thou feltst the smart,
Even at the first, then with a grieved heart,
Thou of thy grievous sins should have repented,
And so Gods angry Judgments have prevented:
This was neglected, and O most unkind,
Gods former benefits imprint in mind
Thou didsts not do, for assuredly,
Before thy wickedness to him did cry
For heavy vengeance, he was wondrous kind
To thee, and thou did many favors find
From him, we are apt to forget God wot,
Or if we do remember, we bear not
The thankful minds we should, and therefore we
Even for our sins most justly plagued be:
Should we persuade our selves Almighty Jove,
This Famous City did mor dearly love,
Then others, that his power could not withstand,
But in the former ages felt his hand:
Or shall we think that shortened is his Arm,
Or that he will not suffer so much harm
To come upon us as he did to those
That sinned as well as we, O, no repose,
Nor harbor in your hearts so vain a thought,
For even as they were to destruction brought:
Even so shall we if we do still offend,
And do not of our sinful lives amend,
For as the Lord is by his mercy known,
To be a gracious God, and he has shown
That in his mercy he does far surpass,
Which plainly does appear, but yet whereas
Almighty God in mercy does abound,
Take this for certain and a constant ground,
As on his mercies we may boldly trust,
So in his Judgments is he always just.
Aye me! I need not long to treat of this,
How many demonstrations daily is,
How many several bells do sadly ring
The doleful tune of this most certain thing,
In this our present sad disastrous plight,
Whilst many souls have bid the world godnight.
My flesh do tremble, I amazed stand,
To see the force of Gods Almighty hand,
My hand do quake, and eke my joints do shiuer,
To see what deadly Arrows from his Quiver,
Are now sent forth to this forsaken City,
Whose very miseries my soul does pity.
GO on my muse now, and right sadly tell,
The doleful sound that every Parish bell,
Within this poor aflicted City make,
That we may from our sinful lives awake:
Our daily sorrows, and continual fears,
Our loss of dear friends, and our daily tears:
That we for them do shed, the sundry moanes,
Deep hearted sighings, and the gricuous groans,
That many a husband for his tender wife,
Sends forth for her that is bereaved of life:
How many a wife mournes for her Turtle mate,
That now lies gasping, struck by cruel fate
Of conquering Death, and when thou haft so done,
Tell how the father grieves for his lost son:
The woeful screeches many a mother mild,
Bitterly sends forth for her dying child,
How many a son weeps for his loving father,
(Whose love so dear was that he would more rather
Have did himself, even such was his good will,
But we cannot our own desires fulfill)
How many a daughter grieves for her deer mother,
And many a sister for her loving brother,
And many a brother for his loving sister,
That knew not what he lost before he mist her:
Here weeps the servant for his loving Master,
And grieves that Death is grown so great a waster,
There sighs the Master for his loving man,
For that he is not able, neither can
Save his poor servants life, with weeping eyes
The careful maiden for her Mistress cries:
The mistress likewise for her maid does moan,
Because so good a seruant's dead and gone.
Neighbor for neighbor, one friend for another,
Their loves were such, their griefs they cannot smother,
The Preacher for his flock, and they for him,
We wail and weep until our eyes are dim,
And then, O Lord, a sad thing for to see,
Yet daily such sad spectacles there be,
They that before, so sadly moumed have,
By other Friends are shortly brought to grave
With much ado, for Friends are very few,
In this their last farewell, their loves to show.
SVch is the force of Deaths fell conquering hand,
That none in this world can his power withstand,
It Is not the power of a mighty King,
Can serve to free him from Deaths deadly sting,
Much less the title of a Lord or Knight,
Can keep their persons from this pale-fac't wight,
It Is not the wisdom of a learned man,
No, there is neither Art nor wisdom can,
Be forcible enough with Art or wile,
Either to stay deaths stroke or him beguile:
Mark it I pray you, how he makes men reele,
His Bow is iron sure, and his Arrows steel:
How many through his might do daily dye,
How many likewise do there sprawling lie,
How many also dead in fields are found,
And suddenly in streets dosall to ground,
Even as they pass, and then before were well,
And felt but little pain until they fell.
STay gentle death, for I assure you can,
The parties held an upright honest man,
You are about to deal, I tell you more,
Of wealth he has a great abundant store,
And liberally he gives to the poor
Of that he has, the like given at his door,
There Is very few that does, nay, hardly any,
Although there do in wealth surpass him many.
I, That is well done, I commend you better,
And for your kindness will remain your debtor,
That miserable, griping, rusty Chuffe,
That always wanted, never had enough,
And never cared how many men were killed,
So he might have his Cofers stuffed and filled,
Ah wr tched Carle, I trust that there is none
True hearted wight will weep when thou art gone,
They in thy life time wept, and were not heard,
Now at thy death they rightly may be spared.
KNow you what you have done, you have flaine a woman,
That for her virtuous carriage, I think no man
Will find the like again, now good Sir tell,
To take the good away, do you do well:
Does there not many an idle Gossip stay?
Who long before we would feign have had away,
Leave of for shame, away now get you gone
Go take the worst sort, leave the best alone.
LOrd if 'twere so, what would become of me,
That know my self to be as bad may be,
For there is not only one, but thousands more,
That I go far behind that went before,
Many a brave Scholar; many a worthy Teacher,
Many a good liver, many a zealous Preacher,
That lived as lights, and were to thee right dear,
So carefully they walked in thy fear,
But I alas, have much abusde thy will,
Had not a care, thy hests for to fulfill,
Have sinned extremely, and assuredly,
Had long before this time, deserved to dye;
But yet, O Lord, I see it is not thy will,
Thou spar'st my life, wilt have me tarry still.
And now I pray thee, whilst I have my being,
Since that thou have vouchsaft to me the seeing,
(Wretch that I am) of this thy mighty power,
Grant that hereafter, daily and each hour,
For that same small time, and the little space
Of life that thou shall grant me by thy grace,
I may redeem time, which I lewdly spent,
Bewail my sins, and heartily repent.
When hoary hyems now had changed his hue,
And for that year had bid the world a due,
When trees began sprout, the grass and every thing
Looked green and fair, lambs skipt, the bird; did sing
And with their warbling notes in woods did Ring
Their makers praise, according to their kind,
April the month was called, for so I find,
(For fore that time there dyed not any store,
That either had the tokens or plague sore)
Then did the Lord begin to lay his hand,
And plainly showed he would give us understand,
That he was angry with us, at the first
Small quaintity there died, Death did not thirst
As now it does, a dozen or a score:
We thought it much, soon after forty more,
Or such like number to the ground were sent,
But hardly any miss of those that went,
Time slides away, our glass does daily run,
And God will finish what he had begun,
For shortly after in the Bills are spide,
About a hundred of the sickness did:
And yet at that time, I remember well,
There Is very few of us could rightly tell,
Whether the sickness were the plague or no,
So willingly we would have had it so:
The Searchers now brought into question be,
For that poor aged folks they could not see
Gods handy-worke, it was thought that they did wrong
To many people, thus did we prolong
Our miseries, advice was taken then
Of Physic Doctors, all held worthy men,
And such as for their skill did much surpass
The meaner sort; they told us, that whereas
Those that from us, this sickness did divide,
Had caught a spotted fever, and so did.
THus the Almighty, though he has and can,
Produce strange wonders by the Art of man,
Nevertheless, when he thinks good, he will
Confound the wisdom, and the learned skill
Of mortal Creatures, and us plainly show,
He can send judgments, that they shall not know
How to prevent, with all their art or skill,
If we rebel, and not his will fulfill.
THE Former Searchers now are in hard case,
They are reprou'd, some forced to loose their place;
And now with cheerful hearts, we do agree,
The former doubt, but a mistake might be;
Yet still alas, the sickness does increase,
And therefore of our fears we do not cease:
Those that they now appoint, are bound with oath,
Upon their consciences to tell the troth,
That neither for reward, or filthy sear,
Or else for any favor that they bear
Unto the persons that are so infected,
Should stop their judgments, now to be expected.
THeir charge received, away now do they hie,
And to their business do they look more nigh,
Days quickly go, the nights likewise full fast,
And very sudainly a week is past;
And now we looked to be resolved well,
And who but searchers could us betrer tell:
The questions asked, and then they told their mind,
That certainly the places which they find
So visited, so far as they could see,
No other sickness then the plague should be.
The reason now of this aforesaid doubt
(As I have heard) by experience is found out,
That as the plague, begins with the year,
So do the marks thereof, at first appear
Much like the spotted Fever, as time goes on,
And year upon his back, puts age upon,
The marks do alter to another hue,
Leaving the red, and then is turned to blew.
WE studdy now, and often cast about,
And call to mind, what heretofore fell out,
Upon the Death of any Souerainge Prince,
Or in Successors reign has happened since,
There Is many of us do remember yet
It was so late, we can it not forget,
When first King James, came here this Crown to sway,
How many by the plague were caught away;
And now the most of us persuaded be,
That such a scknesse we again shall see:
But being come unto the month of June,
It sings to us a sad and mournesfull tune:
For now we think, the sickness will not cease,
Because we find it weekly does increase,
Orders are now prescribde, and best invention
That we can use or find out for prevention,
The doors of sick are shut, and Dogs be killed,
It Is better they should go, then we be filled
With noisome smells, a reason some does tell,
That brings the sickness with us here to dwell,
It to avoid, houses and streets we wash,
And many a paile of water down we pash
Before our doors, the place of those infected,
We warily avoid, though we respected
The visited before their sickness came,
Yet now to see them would redound much blame
Unto us, all the neighbors they would scare us,
And hearing it, few of them would come near us,
For so to do can we tell what may chance
To us, or ours, so far for to advance,
Or venture out our selves, them to come near,
Pray blame us not, we justly may forbear:
Thus did we fear at first, but time grows on,
That which before we could not build upon,
Trinity Term was for that time put off,
Causes of suite in Law were driven off
Till longer time, they that came many a mile
With grief return, stay here but little while,
That hoped to have seen some happy end
O^ their long Suites, now vainly do they spend
Both time and money, London they forsake,
And many a long and weary step they make,
Before they come unto their wished desire,
To see the smoke that issues from the fire
Of their own Chymneys, and to prevent
Danger of infection, the Parliament,
That ever commonly with us did sit,
Do now forbear, and think it far more fit,
That kept it should be in some other place:
The City Oxford 'twas that had the grace
Of that assembly: there they time did spend
No doubtful careful, for to make an end
Of that they had in hand, statutes are acted,
And in a book together are compacted
For public good; there let them rest a while,
Whilst we go forwards in our homely style,
To tell you truly what did come to pass
To month next following which called July was:
Each week with longing we desire to see
VVhither the bills increast or lessened be,
But where the figures set for hundreds were,
Now thousands three and more there do appear,
By hundreds three, four score five in number,
Due time it is for us to leave of slumber:
And generally with one voice and accord,
We gin to weigh the judgments of the Lord,
And seek to him, our helper and our guide,
That we of mercy may not be denide
In this affliction, call to mind our sin
With humble prayers and fasting we begin,
That so we may appease Gods angry hand,
(The only way his judgments to withstand)
Wherein assuredly we did do well,
We knew the gracious goodness which befell
To Niniue, and other Cities noe,
Which else had bin destroyed, had't not bin so
They had repented, this right godly thing,
First was commended by our noble King,
Thereby he showed, that he a Father was
Unto this City, and what came to pass
He took to heart, alas what better love,
Or friend for friendship can we further prove,
Then at such times, as we afflicted be,
That they are moved our miseries to see,
And do their best endeavors, to be brief,
Use all the art they can for our relief.
In this renowned King, great commendation
We must ascribe, welfare and preservation
Of us and ours was daily in thy mind,
As by thy provident care we did it find:
Should we unthankful be, it were most vild,
And we hereafter justly might be stild
Ungrateful subjects, likewise know 'twas he,
Gave special order that a book should be
Read in our Fasts of Prayers, and Psalms selected
Fit for the times, so greatly he respected
The safety of our souls; another Book
By him was fet forth, wherein if you look,
Medcines for bodies health did there insert,
With wary visements, how we should divert
Or keep our selves from causes of Infection,
What else to do he gave to us direction.
But well-away, before the month is gone,
How many thousands, left us here alone,
And gave us leave to fast, and eke to pray,
For neither wealth nor Counsel could them stay;
Both rich and poor, away now do they hye,
Both old and young, they care not where they lie,
In barnes, or hay-cockes, fields, or under tree,
Nor how they fare, so London they not see.
LOndon that heretofore had such Renown,
Is not respected as a common Town,
Her glories darkened and her strength decade,
And those that trusted in her are afraid
For to come near her, London that heretofore
Which for the bigness sure was people more
Then any City in the world again,
Does say when God is angry it is but vain
To trust in multitude, but I call to mind,
When 't did abound with men, then most unkind,
Full many of us grudge to have it so,
Thinking the cause thereof procured us woe,
So many of a trade, (thus did we grieve)
That one man by another could not live;
Sure God was angry with us, now you see
The City of large multitudes are free,
Where is the doings that should now abound?
Sure nothing else but wayling is there found,
For want of those that in the same did dwell,
And when woe will be done we cannot tell.
But shall I leave our fellow brethren so,
And not vouchsafe a little for to go,
To bring them out of town, at leastwise know,
The favor jolly Country men did show
To strangers and to kin, but fitst alas
You know it is fitting they should have a pass,
Whither he be a wiseman or an Ass,
Unless he mean to lie upon the grass:
The which unto the Country men they show;
Contents whereof does let all people know,
That where Almighty God (more is the pity)
With sickness now had visited the City,
Yet notwithstanding (blessed be his high hand,)
Their dwelling house, amongst the rest does stand
Free from infection: nay, some thought it meet,
To set down in their writing, all the street
Wherein they dwelled (praised be God) was clear,
And therefore as for that, you need not fear
To give them entertainment; this safe kept,
Made many that at first full sweetly slept
In wholesome beds, and likewise to fare well,
But afterward it otherwise befell:
London they thought all over was infected,
And therefore they no passes now respected.
VVAndring in Fields, some here, some there do lie,
And by the way there is many of them die,
A grievous spectacle for to behold,
And causing tears may for to hear it told,
To see that Christians should be so estranged,
And from their mark Christianity so ranged,
That from another they no love can have,
So far as to vouchsafe them to their grave,
But leave them merciles, even where they die,
And so expose them to the ravenous eye
Of Fowls and other vermin, very unfit,
And surely shows small love, or little wit
In these our Countrie-men; but I alas,
Am gone too far with you, how shall I pass
From whence I came, you know I am expected;
And let not London be by me neglected.
FAsts are continued, Wensday is the day,
And many of us I dare boldly say,
Did carefully observe them, many more,
(I do persuade me) did not keep them so
As fit they should, it is goodly for to see,
How yet our Churcher filled with people be,
And with attention do the Preacher hear,
Although so many durst not venture there,
For fear of further harm, I never heard
Such zealous Preaching that was still conferd
Unto the hearers; brave renowned men
That so encouraged us, I would my pen
Had all the art that might be to give praise,
Unto your worthy actions; many ways
You did declare your selves like Champions stout,
And were the only men that held us out
From fainting, Physicians they were fled,
Only a few amongst the rest, some dead,
And grief to speak, but true it is (God wot,)
Of your own Coat too many tarried not:
To those that staid then, you gain double praise,
For taking pains when Halcion were our days,
And stick not now your lives for us to spend,
Even your own bloods, so that you might but end
Twixt God and us the strife, this was your care,
Thus Moses humbly sought the Lord to spare
Hard hearted Jews, full often was he heard,
And I persuade my self God has not bard
Sweet mercies gate so fast, but one time he
Or other with our prayers will pleased be:
Go on therefore, surely of God y'blest,
And let not the Almighty yet take rest,
Until that by his mercies we do find
Gods wrath appea^de, and he of other mind.
And next on earth then you shall have the praise,
Men, wives and children, shall with pleasing lays,
Have cause to sing your Victories about,
And say you were their Champions fell and stout,
That Jacob like did wrestle with the Lord,
And held him fast until he did afford
To hold his hand, and this great sickness stay,
This may be said of you another day.
ALthough the Sun shinde bright, the Heavens fair,
Yet still we thought corrupted was the air,
Great cause it was of sickness, so we thought,
And so by learned writers were we tought:
It to avoid, the best advice we take,
To clear the Air, great Bonesiers we make
Before our doors, as likewise pans of fire
Ymixt with pitch, so greatly we desire
Cause of Infections cease, then thought it meet,
That every one at home, or else in street
(As they did pass) should to a Nose-gay smell
Held in their hands, which would do very well:
Some made of Hemp and Pitch, others thought fit
To use some other Sents, which I omit.
And Franckensence in houses do we burn,
And use all other means we can to turn
That into sweet we thought corrupted was,
Lets leave off this and tell what came to pass.
ANd now imagine July we have past,
August the Month is, wherein we so fast
Do leave this world, to seek another rest,
Where in one week there died at the least
Five thousand souls, two hundredth and five,
They Would make a fair show to be seen alive:
So many thousands in the Country gone,
And we so few in number left alone,
And yet so many in one week should dye,
So many courses, that I think nere eye
Did ere behold daily and howerly pass
Within this City, infinite grief alas,
Must needs possess those that are left alive,
And for our safeguard, how do we now strive,
These lines ensuing will directly tell,
Please you peruse them and to mark them well.
THe eighteenth of the month that was the week,
Now not so much for human helps we seek,
But ready for Deaths stroke we do prepare,
And for to gain heavens Crown is all our care:
Daily we see our Friends and neighbors dye,
And who can say is next, ore he or I:
The shunning now of sick is not respected,
For who does know whose house is not infected,
They are not now pent up, doors are open,
No coy there is with any to be spoken,
But one with other do consort together,
And as for danger few of us care whether,
The party we are with be sick or no,
Only we ask him whether it be so;
And where the pain proceeds, rising or spot,
And to their beds we go, for we are not
So timorous; but do approach them near,
And with our best advise we do them cheer;
And being dead now we such kindness have,
None will refuse to bring them to the grave,
But after Beeres we throng without disdain,
And in our judgment hold it very vain,
If we should not our last performance lend
To such a neighbor or to such a Friend,
Discourteous, unfit and eke faint-hearted,
Thus did we meet and thus we kindly parted.
Well may I say to many a Country lout
Of this our Kingdom, where is the valor stout
Possessed your fearful hearts? what is the matter
That so for fear your very teeth do chatter
Within your heads, why do your bones so shiuer?
As if you neither had nor heart nor liver:
To see a London man, oh you are undone,
Venture not near, but as far from him run,
As Furlongs two contain at least, oh fly,
His very breath will smell, as far as eye
Can ere behold him: are you not a shamed,
And in all good men's judgments to be blamed:
I am not ignorant of your churlish dealing,
The wound that open is, will need long healing
Of your unkindness showed to our poor City:
Hard hearted men, you should have had more pity.
You think us Cowards, you the worthies are,
And who but you, for sturdie men of war:
How is it now, do you not plainly see,
London does yield as stout as any he,
Lives on your clotted grounds, as do appear,
We stand not in such dread, nor do we fear
The loss of our poor life's, for in a word,
Although we in a manner see the sword,
Of the Almighties Justice ever wauing
Over our heads, killing many craving,
Yet from the venger do we never shrink,
No we persuaded be and surely think,
That he is every where and that he can,
(And if please him) send to the Country man,
As great a sickness as he has to us,
Thus I persuade my self and even thus
Should you persuaded be and understand,
That the best means for to avoid God hand,
Is not to fly, but to approach him near
With hearty sorrow, take heed how we we bear
Our selves hereafter that we not offend,
Else worser judgments God to us can send
Where ere we be, with you I have now done:
Lord with what longing do the people run,
To know what number this next week have did,
And now (blessed be his name) we have espide
A happy ceasing of his anger past,
For in this week they dyed not so fast:
Four thousand, eight hundred, one and forty fell,
Though a great number, it reioyst us well
To see a ceasing, and with thankful mind,
We gave Gods thanks for that he was so kind;
And by the way now this is to be noted,
And will be marked by those that are devoted,
When we were now even hurled into despair
And scarce cared whether day was foul or fair,
Such a perplexity were we driven in,
That how the world went we weighed not a pin,
When we were almost wear now with crying,
And almost past all hope for ought relying
At the Almighties hands, lo even then,
He began to show unto us (sinful men)
Some tokens, that his anger will not long
Continue, if so be we sing the song
Of true repentance. I remember well
The Prohibition of our fast days fell
This very week, the ceasing was before,
We cannot then directly say therefore,
That they were cause so many were infected,
I hope there is few that are so ill affected
As so to think; did we not meet together,
And as I said before, we cared not whether
Daily and hourly 'bout our worldly ends,
Some one for one thing, others see their Friends
Lie visited: sick with well we mingle,
Those that are well from sick we cannot single,
Yet many of us were both well and sound,
And I amongst the rest this favor found;
(Blessed be his holy name) no more of this,
Now in my mind a homebred story is,
Of one I knew, a Countryman of mine,
(Hardly deserving here to have a line)
Who did refrain the Church (so wise was he)
So did his son lest they infect might be:
What I insert I heard it to be true,
And I think God their judgment gave them due,
Neither in Church or Church yard did they dye,
But in the open Fields there did they lie.
ANd one thing more I thought good to observe,
Whether it observation do deserve,
Or no I pray you judge, this did I find,
When we unto each other were most kind,
And feared not the visited to see,
Yet even at that time I noted we
Did find a ceasing, which did plainly show,
That we unto the Almighty much did owe
For his great love, beyond imagination,
And far beyond all human expectation:
For fore that time most were of judgment still,
The reason why so many there were ill,
Was cause they took not heed, nor much respected,
To keep themselves from those that were infected;
The last great sickness it did fall out so,
(As I have heard) well let us forwards go,
Not that I think the sickness not infect,
For many then my judgment will reject,
For to the contrary it does appear,
Therefore i would wish no mortal wight come near
Infected persons to presume too much,
Unless occasions so great be such,
As either them to help or help themselves,
Else should I count them for presuming Elues.
VVEarie with toil and with sad cares oppressed,
Let now my muse from this sad strain take reft,
Nevertheless but for a little while,
And give me leave but only for to smile
At worldlings folly, how with care they strive
To keep their earthly Carcasses alive,
Whilst others pining do desire to dye,
Respectlesse of their lives, such misery
They do sustain, y wrapped in cruel love,
Or else some higher crosses from above,
For recreation I think best befits,
In time of sadness to revive our wits
With honest mirth, a story for to tell,
The best I have mark then how it befell:
In Gloucester shiere, (a parcel of this Land)
There Cheltenham my native Town does stand,
Many a brave lad has there been bred and bore,
As well in these our times as long before,
Who hand to hand in battle would men thrill,
Ere they from them would suffer any ill:
Howbeit now the sickness (as I hear)
Have brought these hardy men into great fear:
Yet to their kindred still their love is such,
To give them kind relief they will not grutch,
Provided always that they may be pent,
In some remoted place whereas the sent
May not annoy the dwellers of the Town,
Else one against another well might frown:
Some two miles off the same there stands a hill,
That if you saw it, surely say you will
It is a great one, likewise very high,
Not far upon, nor yet not very nigh
A wood does stand, Puckham is called by name,
And there abouts is of great note and fame
In nutting time, then famous let it be
A little more, for that we now do see,
It proves a shelter to our London men,
Who there did lurk as Foxes in their den,
But if they chanced abroad once for to stere,
More dreadful far then wolves they did appear
To friend or foe: if once they do them spy,
Their sight more fell then Basilis koes eye,
There lodged that hard Squire Sir Henry hight,
A valiant, doubty and courageous spright,
There lay that Lady bright, his partner dear,
That were most bravely brought on horseback there:
With diverse others men of mickle worth,
That were resolved none of them to come forth,
But round about the wood to roue and range,
Until the Moon had past her full and change:
This was the order then, but out alas,
Whilst we on hills are, there is a London Ass
Or Carrier comes to Town within bow shot,
When as the sickness reigned exceeding hot,
His pack he does untie, and London ware
Lies open to be caught with Cheltnam air:
High time it is for safety to provide,
More harm then ere aware may them betide,
The matter known some wise men of the Town,
Bold affrappeth this fool hardy Clown,
With bitter threats, and with a dire aspect,
This great presumptuous act they do detect,
And to him spoke thus or to this effect:
Thou London vagrant, bold presumptuous man,
All words to good for thee that name we can,
Is this a place for thee for to untie?
At such a time as this, now verily,
If straight thou do not trusse, and quickly run
From this same coast, we will shoot thee with a Gun.
At which hard words forthwith it did appear,
How much it deern'd him by the trembling fear
Of all his joints, for greatly he did quake,
And seemed as if his very heart did ache,
Sighing, quoth he, good sits be not offended,
What Is done amiss hereafter shall be mended.
COurage brave London, heart unto thee take,
For every week the sickness now does slake,
What shall we always faint, be drooping men
And think that nere good time will come again,
Indeed it is true, many our Friends are gone,
And dear ones too, we cannot choose but moan
For them a while, Gods hand we cannot stay
When he does please to strike, well wish we may,
Time is for all, a time there is to die,
And as they are so must be you and I,
A debt we owe, that is to God a Death,
Short is our life and soon gone is our breath:
Here is no resting place, Pilgrims we are
Within this world, unto a Country far
We have to trace, it is to Heavens high,
To which we cannot come before we die:
They are in rest no doubt, we still in care,
Sorrow we taste, but they do better fare.
LIke as in bloody field a battle fought,
By raging enemies that always sought
To work unto each other harm and skath,
And naught but death could swage their banefull wrath,
Where many thousands in one battle dye,
And many groueling on the earth do lie,
After a long and weary battle tried,
So many wounded eke so many did,
Upon retire they do their losses count,
And find they do in number much surmount,
Of this poor City such now was the case,
When time had made so many run the race
Of this their mortal lives, the rest behind
To know the perfect number were inclined
Of those that died the several Bills they view,
And cast them up to be informed true:
The better to express, cease Verse a while,
And let us forwards in another style.
GEntle Reader, I am not ignorant what great mortallity has been reported,
and verily believed to be in London, in almost all places of this Kingdom, by
reason of this sickness; and that they conceived a far greater number dyed,
then indeed there did: or at leastwise not considering, or once imagining,
such a multitude of people, men, women and children should be in one place, or
City, thought verily there were hardly any or very few of us left a live.

Indeed the streets were empty in respect of the large multitudes that
formerly before this great sickness past too and fro in it; but there was no
grass growing in any streets of note for want of trading as they conceived;
for I persuade me as many people past too and fro in the streets of the said
City in the highest of the sickness upon their occasions, as did at any time
in the streets of any other City or great Town of this Kingdom where the
sickness was not, (setting Faires and appointed assemblies aside) wherefore we
were not all dead. Indeed if God Almighty had goneon in wrath, as of long time
you see he did continue, we should have all been ere long consumed. But he is
a God of mercy, and is graciously pleased to leave some behind; yea very many
for a witness both of his Justice and Mercy.

And as in my former similitude, after a battle fought as well the several
armies as the several adverse Countries, will hearken after and take notice of
the loss received, although they may be much moved for the same: So I
persuade my self both City and Country in this Kingdom that have had no
certainty of the number that have dyed in this present visitation, although
they wish well to the City, (it being the harbor of many of their kindred and
friends, and in a manner the beauty, wealth and strength of this nation:) will
desire notwithstanding to be truly informed; and therefore as aiming
altogether, to make my poor subject profitable or pleasing, or at least wise
not burthen-some to all to whose hands it shall happen to come, I have taken
this pains to set down the number, both in gross and as they dyed weekly, so
may you perceive the increase and decrease.

There dyed in London and the Lyberties thereof.

The Total of the last great sickness happening in the beginning of the Reign
of our late Sovereign Lord King James deceased, viz. From the 23. of December
1602. to the 22. of December 1603. there dyed of all diseases in London and the
Liberties 38244. whereof of the plague 30578. Wherein the greatest number that
dyed in one week was in London and the Liberties, in all 3385. Whereof the
plague, 3035.

IN Former times this Kingdom and City have bin likewise visited, as soon
after the Conquest of King William Duke of Normandy there happened a fearful
plague: As likewise in the Reign of King Edward the third; and in the year
1562. in which year there died of the Pestilence, 20136. also in Anno 1592. in
which year there dyed in all 25886. whereof the plague in and about London,
1503.

Other parts of the world have likewise felt Gods hand, as you may read in
Scripture of Jerusalem, etc. Further it is recorded of the City called the
grand Cair in Turkey, once every seven years there happens a vehement
Contation, to the loss of most part of the people there. In Rome there have
dyed 2000. a day, and 100000. in a year: In Constantinople 5000. a day, and
700000. within six months: In the City of Paris in France 100000. in a year,
viz. in Anno 1348.

In Millan, Padua and Venice 100000. in each City within two years: In Bohemia
300000. in the like space: and so likewise in other Cities and Kingdoms, and
at several times has God shown his power.

AS one a sleep of many pleasing toys
Often times does dream, and thinks that he enioyes,
That which indeed he does not, when he wakes,
Into his former dumpes himself betakes;
So after we such bitter storms had tasted,
For want of Trade whilst that the sickness lasted,
Luld with vain hope, when as we still did see
The sickness cease, that here a Term should be
Without all question kept: thus thought we then,
And for a while we were right joyful men,
Our shops begin to open we prepare,
And set them out with sundry sorts of ware,
Although before this time windows stood bare,
Open or shut we did not greatly care.
When news does come that sets us into passion,
The King proclaims by his Proclamation,
That there no Term of Michael should be kept,
But where the Proclamation did direct.
Which was to Reading, good for Bark shire men,
You may conjecture what a plunge we then
Were put unto; how shall our Rent be paid,
And other needments which we want defrayd:
Now many a poor soul in the streets we see,
For want to beg and crave, which would not be,
But that the times so hard are, others shamed,
(Although their need is great) yet to be named
A cra^ing beggar, much they would endure
Ere they could brook to put the same in ure;
And therefore far more harder was their case,
Then those that begged and cared not to be base:
It Is such a time that many a sigh is fet
By those we good-men call, yet run in debt,
And further also I think like to run,
Good Lord amend it else we are undone:
Albeit it is a comfort that we find
That King and great men were so well inclined,
Their charitable deeds for to express,
In these our great afflictions to redress
The wants of poor men which did so abound
Within this City that no place was found
Without a multitude, and to prevent,
Means was collected, orders there were sent
By Proclamation, how it should be used,
That so their worthy deeds be not abusde:
This was commended to the weighty care
Of Londons Governor the worthy Mayor;
Who in the same did show himself upright,
Got great applause in all the peoples sight,
This worthy Act did many others move,
To show their Charity and Christian love,
Yea those that had not much themselves would give
Of that they had, poor people to relieve
In these sad times, abroad and at the door,
Thus were we moved, so fared it with the poor:
Examples surely are of wondrous force,
In such sad times as these to strike remorse
Into men's hearts, but more when as we see
Before our eyes the woeful misery
Of those that want, no doubt most that were here
And saw these things more liberal far they were
Then erst before, and to tell plain my mind,
What others write my self did daily find
Them very free, for wheresoere I was
At home or broad, giving there always was
By one or other, unto those that cried,
Who hardly of an Alms deed were denied
Of them they asked; foretimes it was not so,
But many should be ask't that would say no,
Before that we would see ones wants relieved,
So hard our hearts were to poor souls y'grieued;
And now to you that in the Country be,
Hear not the cries of poor, nor yet do see
Their miserable wants, how they have fared,
And how we to our powers have not spared
Our means for to relieve them, if we slack,
Let not our slacknesse you hard hearted make
When you shalberequired, I may say,
We have done well, whilst you have been away:
Still need there is, and like is so to be,
'Twill be a pleasing thing for us to see
You home again in peace, if much you make
Of poor afflicted ones for Christ his sake.
LAstly to all Residers of this Land,
That at this time have felt the Almighties hand,
Or seen the heavy judgments that have been,
Since that the cause thereof is only sin,
For which we have euduted many a smart,
And often times gone to bed with aching heart;
Like dreaded children let us now be wise,
And have a care that we do not despise,
Or set at light the anger of our God,
Least he in fury with a greater rod
In vengeance come upon us, warning take
By this most grievous chastment, now awake
And look about us, let us call to mind
What mighty Cities we in writings find,
That heretofore for glory bare the bell,
And through the world did far and near excel,
The Famous Niniue, Jerusalem,
Troy, Carthage, Room and many more with them,
Which for their sins were wholly overthrown,
Their standing places hardly to be known,
And in this sad disaster let us not
Forget the woeful state, which now God wot
Renowned Judea and the Eastern Lands,
That now lie groaning under Turkish bands:
The famous Grecia, many Countries more,
Who all one God and Savior did adore
That we do now, but going far astray,
Have wrought unto themselves such sad anoy,
That grief it is to tell: Oh that my pen,
Or all the art I have could now move men,
To leave their evil courses, and to turn
Unto their maker, inwardly to mourn
For what has bin the cause of this sad woe,
And gain the love of him that now our foe.
Appears to be: how have we wandered wide,
In vain excess of riot, sinful pride,
Where was the love that with us should be found,
And with Gods servants should to all abound,
Was it not turned to hatred and despite,
Or such a love as strayd far from the right,
Most filthy fraud, we loved for to deceive,
And if we could our neighbors to bereave
Of that they had, be it but a good name,
(If we had none) we enui'd at the same,
Our swearing and blaspheming, hateful lies,
Have pe'rst the very Heavens and there cries
For flaming vengeance, and our great oppression
Have there bin likewise, and have made confession
Before we'd do it our selves, our beastly lust
And many other sins did stick as rust
Upon our sinful souls, oh now like men
Lets rouse these dangerous Adders from their den,
These have bin they that have our sorrows sought,
And these were they that to destruction brought
The other woeful Countries: these are they
That if we not forsake them will destroy
Our woeful Land likewise, now let us weep
And drench our eyes in floods of sorrows deep,
That we so great a God have not regarded,
Conclude that we most justly are rewarded
For our misdeedes, and let us from them cease,
This is the way to make a final peace
'Twixt God and us; so let all good men pray
Amen, Amen with me, God grant we may.
FINIS.
