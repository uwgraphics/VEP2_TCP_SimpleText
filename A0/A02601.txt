: Diverse frutful gatherynges of scripture and declarynge of faith and works Of
the law.
THe law is a doctrine that byddeth good and forbideth euel as his
commandments specifye.

The ten commandments
Thou shall worshype but one god. Thou shall make the none image to-worshepe
it. Thou shall not swear by his name in vain. Hold the sabbath day holy.
Honor thy father and thy mother Ex. 20. Mat. 22*
Thou shall not kylle^ Thou shall not commit aduoutry. Thou shall not steal.
Thou shall bear no false witness. Thou shall not desire ought that belongs to
thy neighbor.
Mayor.
He that loves god and his neygboure keeps all the commandments of god.
Deu. 6. Mat. 22.
Love thy Lord god with all thine heart / with all thy soul / and with all thy
mind. This is the first and great commandment. The second is like unto
this: that is love thy neighbor as thy sele. In these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets.

Minor.
He that loves god / loves his neighbor.
If a man say / I love god / and yet hates his brother / 1. Ioa. 4
he is a liar.

He that loves not his brother whom he has seen / how can he love god who^
has not seen.

Conclu. sion.
He that loves his neighbor as him self kepth all the commandments of god.
Mat. 7.
what so ever ye would that men should do to you / even so do to them.

Romans 13
For this is the laws and the prophets. He that loves his neighbor
fulfylleth the law. Thou shall no^ commytte aduoutry. Thou shall no^ kill.
Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not hear false witness. Thou shall not
desire / and so forth if there be any other commandment / all are
comprehended in this saying: love thy neighbor as thy self. Gala. 5.
All the law is fulfilled in one word / that is / love thy neighbor as thy
self.

He that loves god keeps all the commandments. Mayor.

He that loves his neygboure keeps all the commandments of god To. xiii.
gala.v. and he that loves god loves his neygboure.i. Joan iiii. ergo he that
loves god keeps all his commandments.

He that has the faith loves god. Minor.

My father loves you / because ye love me and believe that I come of god. Ioa^.
16


He that has the faith keeps all the commandments of god. Co^clusio

He that has the faith / loves god / and he that loves god keeps all his
commandments ergo he that has the faith keeps all the commandments of
god.

He that kepyth one commandment of god keeps them all.
For without faith it is impossible to keep any of the commandments of god
/ Hebre. 11
and he that has the faith keeps all the commandments of god ergo he that
keeps one commandment of god keeps them all.

He that keeps not all the commandments of god keeps not one of them
He that kepethe one commandment of god / he keeps al / ergo he that kepethe
not all the commandments of god keeps not one of them.

It is not in our power to keep any of the commandments of god.
Uvith out grace / it is impossible to keep any of the commandments of god /
and grace is not in our power: ergo it is not i^ our power to keep any of the
commandments of god even so may you reason concerning the holy ghost and
faith.

The law was given to show us our sin.
By the law co^eth the knowledge of sin. Roma. 3.


I knew not what sin me^t but through the law. Roma. 7


I had not known what lust had me^t except the law had said thou shall not
lust.

with out the law sin was deed / that is it moved me not neither wist I that
it was sin / which not with stondinge was sin and forbyden by the law.

The law bids us do that thing which is impossible for us.
For it bids us keep the commandments of god / and yet is it not in our
power to keep any of them / ergo it bids us do that is impossible for us.
Thou wylt say where to does god bid us do that is impossible for us? I answer
/ to make the know that thou art but evil / and that there is no remedy to
save the in thine own hand / and that thou may seek remedy at sum othere
for the law does naught but command the.

Of the gospel.
THe gospel is as much to say i^ our tongue / as good tidings like as one of
these are.

Christ is the savior of the world Joan. 4. Luce. 2. Roma. 5.

as declare unto us the mercy of god.

The nature of the law and the gospel.

The gospel shows us our redempcio^

The law is the word of Ire.

The gospel is the word of grace.

The law is the word of despair.

Tht law is the word of unrest.

The gospel is the word of peace.

A dysputacion between the law and the gospel.

The gospel says / Christ has made it for the,

The law says / the father of heaven is wroth with the.

The gospel says / Christ is thy right wysenes thy goodness and satisfaccyo^.
The law sayeh thou art bound and obliged to me / to the deuell and to hell.
The gospel says / Christ has delivered the from them all.

Of faith.
Faith is to believe gdd: like as Abraham believed god and it was imputed unto
him for rythtwysenes. Gene. 15.


He that believes god / believes his word.
To believe one is to believe his word and to recounte it true that he says.

He that believes not gods word / believes not god him self.
1. Ioa^. v.
He that believes not gods word he counts him false and a lyare / and
believes not that he may and will fulfill his word: and so he denies both the
might of god and god him self.

Faith is the gift of god.
Iaco, 1.
Every good thing is the gift of god faith is good ergo faith is the gift of
god.

Faith is not in our power,
The gift of god is not in our power faith is the gift of god ergo faith is
not in our power.

without faith it is impossible to please god.
All that comes not of faith is syn / for without faith can no man please god.
To. 14. Heb. 11.
Besides that he that lacks faith he trusts not god / he that trusts not
god trusts not his word / he that trusts not his word holds him false
and a liar / he that holds him false and a liar he believes not that he may
do that he promised / and so denies he that he is god. And how can a man being
of this facyon please him? No manner of way / ye suppose he did all the deeds
that ever did man or angel.

All that is done in faith pleases God.
Right is the word of god and al his works in faith. Lord thine eyes look to
faith / that is as much to say as lord thou delyghtest in faith.

God loves him that believes in him / how can they then displease him.

He that has the faith is just and good / and a good tree bears good fruit:
ergo all that is done in faith pleased god. More over / he that has the faith
believes god: he that believes god / believes his word: he that believes his
word / woteth well that he is true and faithful and may not lie. But knows
that he both may and will fulfill his word how can he then displease him? for
thou can not do any greater honor to god / then to count him true Thou will then say that theft / murder / aduoutry and al vices please god. Nay
verily for they can not be done in faith: for a good tree bears good fruit.

He that has the faith wotteth well that he pleases god?
For all that is done in faith pleases god.

Faith is a surenes.
Heb. 11.
Faith is a sure confidence of things which are hoped for / and a certenty of
things which are not seen.

Roma. 8.
The same spirit certeneth our spirit that we are the children of god.

More over he that has the faith wotteth well that god will fulfill his word:
ergo faith is a surenes.

A man is iustyfyed by faith.
Gene. 15.
Abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for ryghtwysenes. we supposse
therefore that a man is justified by faith with out the deeds of / Roma. 3.
he law.

Roma. 4
He that works not but believes on him that justified the ungodly / his faith
is counted to him for ryghtwysenes.

The just mam lyuethe by his faith. (...) Gala. 2.
Abacuc. 2. To. 1. we know that a man is not justified by the deeds of the
law but by the faith of Jesus Christ. And we believe in Jesus Christ / that we
may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the deeds of the law.

Of the faith of Christ.
The faith of christ / is to believe i^ him that is to believe his word and to
believe that he will help the in all thy need and deliver the from all evil /
thou will ask me what word? I answer / the gospel.

He that believes in Christ shall be saved.
He that believes the sone has everlasting life / Joan. ^. Joan. 6.
verily verily I say unto you / he that believes in me has everlasting.

This I wryt unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may
know how that ye have eternal life Them as because thou have free me / 1.
Ioa^. 5.
Joan. 2^
therefore have thou believed / happy are they that have not seen / and yet have
believed in me.

All the prophets to him bear wytnes Acts. 10.
/ that who so ever believes in him shall have remyssyon of their sins. what
must I do that I may be saved the apostles a^swered believe i^ the lord Jesus
Criste and thou shall he saved. Act. 16.
If thou knowledge with thy mouth that Jesus is the lord. To. 10.
And believe with thine heart that god raised him up from death thou shall be
saved.

He that believes not in Christ shall be comdempned.
He that believes not shall be dampened He that believes not the son shall never
se the life but the ire of god bydeth upon him. Mar. 16. Joan. 2.


The holy ghost shall reprove the world of sin / because they believe not in me

They that believe in Jesus Christ are the sons of god.
Gala. 3.
Ye are all the sons of god because ye believe in Jesus Christ:

He that believes that Christ is the son of god is saved.
Mat. 16.
Peter said / thou art Christ the son of the living god, Jesus answered and
said unto him, happy art thou Simon the son of Jonas for flesh and blood
has not opened to the that / but my father that is in heaven.

Joan. 6.
we have believed and know that thou art Christ the son of the living god.
Joan. 11.
I believe that thou art Christ the son of god which should come i^ to the world
These things are wryte^ that ye might believe that Jesus is Christ the son
of god / Joan. 20
and that ye in beleuyng might have life.

I believe that Jesus is the son of god. Acts. 8.


He that believes god believes the gospel.
He that believes god believes his word and the gospel is his word /
therefore he that believes god believes the gospel, As (Christ is the savior
of the world. Joan. 4.
Christ is our savior Christ bought us with his blood.

Christ wyshe us with his blood. Apo. 1. Heb. 7.8. 1. Pet. 2.


Christ offered him self for us.

Christ bare our sins on his own back. etc^.

He that believes not the gospel believes not god.
He that believes not gods word / believes not him self / and the gospel
is gods word / ergo he that believes not the gospel believes not God him
self / and consequently they that believe not the above vryten and such other /
believe not god.

He that believes the gospel shall be saved.
Go ye in to all the world and p^ache the gospel unto every creature / Mar.
16.
he that believes and is baptized shall be saved but he that believes not shall be
comdempned.

A comparison between faith and unfaithfulness or incredulite.
Faith is the rote of al good.

Incredulyte is the root of all euel.

Faith makes god and man good fre^des

Incredulyte makes them foes.

Faith brings god and man together.

Incredulyte sundereth them.

All that faith does pleases god.

All that icredulyte does displeases god

Faith only makes a man good and ryghtwyse.

Incredulyte only makes him iniust and evil.

Faith makes a man a member of Christ

Incredulyte makes him a membre of the devil.

Faith makes a man the inherytoure of heaven.

Incredulyte makes him enherytoure of hell.

Faith makes a man the servant of god.

Incredulyte makes him the seruante of the deuell.

Faith shows us god to be a sweet father.

Incredulyte shows him a terryble judge.

Faith holds stiff by the word of god

Incredulyte wauereth here and there

Faith counterhe and holdethe god to be true.

Incredulyte holds him false and a lyare

Faith knows god.

Incredulyte knows him not.

Faith loves both god and her neighbor.

Incredulyte loves nether another.

Faith only saves us.

Incredulyte only condempneth us

Faith extolleth god and his deades

Incredulyte extolleth her self and her own deeds.

Of hope
HOpe is a trusty lokynge after the thing that is promised us to come as we
hope after everlasting joy which Christ has promised unto all that believe in
him.

we should put our hope and trust in god alonly and in no another thing.
It is good to trust in god and not in man He that trusts in his own heart
is a fool.

It is good to trust in god and not in princes. Psa. 117


They shall be like unto the images they make and all that trust in them. Psalm. 113


He that trusts i^ his own thoughts does ungodly. Oro. 12.


Hie. 17.
Cursed be he that trusts i^ man. Bid the rych men of this world that they
trust not in their unstable riches / but that they trust in the living god.
Mat. 10.
It is hard for them that trust in money to enter in to the kingdom of heaven.

More over we should trust i^ him only that may help us / god only may hel^^
us / ergo we should trust in him onl^ well is them that trust in god and woe is
them that trust not in him.

Hier, 17.
well is the man that trusts i^ god for god shall be his trust.

Sapi. 3. Psalm. 5.
He that trustethe in him shall understand the veryte. They shall al rejoice
that trust in the / they shall ever be glade and thou wylt defend them.

Of charity.
Charity is the love of thy neighbor. The rule of charity is this Do as thou
would be done to.

For charity holds all a like the rych and the poor / the friend and the fo
/ foo / the thankeful and unthankful the kynseman and stranger.

A comparyson between faith / hope and charity.
Faith comes of the word of god / hope comes of faith / and charity
spryngeth of them both.

Faith believes the word: hope trusts after it that is promised by the word
charity does good unto her neygboure through the love that it has to god and
gladness that is with in her sefe. Faith lokethe to god and his word / hope
looks unto his gift and reward / charity looks on her neighbors profit.
Faith receaueth god / hope receueth his reward / Charity loves her neygboure
with a glad heart, and that witout any respect of reward Faith pertayneth to
god only / hope to his reward / and charity to her neighbor.

Of works.
NO manner of works make us ryghtwyse / we believe that a man shall be iustyfyed
without works. No man is iustyfyed by the deeds of the law / but by the faith
of Jesus Christ / Gala. 2.
and we believe in Jesus Christ that we may be iustyfyed be the faith of Christ
and not by the deeds of the law. If ryghtwysenes came by the law then dyed
Christ in vain. Gala. 2. Gala. 3.
That no man is iustyfied by the law it is manifest / for a ryghtwyse man
lyuethe by his faith / but the law is not of faith.

Moreover / sithe Christ the maker of heaven and earth and all that is therein /
behooved to dye for us we are compelled to grant that we were so far drouned
and sunken in sin that nether our deeds nor all the treasures that eue^ god
made or might make / might have help us out of them / ergo no deeds nor works
may make us ryghtwyse. No works make us vnryghtwyse. For if any works made us
vnryghtwyse then the contrary works should make us ryghtwyse. But it is proved
yt no works can make us ryghtwyse / ergo no works make us vnrightwise

works make us neygther good nor evil.
It is proved that no works neither make us ryghtwyse nor vnryghtwyse ergo no
works make us neither good nor evil. For ryghtwyse and good ar one thing and
vnryghtwyse and euel likewise one.

Good works make not a good man nor evil works an evil man / Mat. 7.
but a good man makes good works and an euel man euel works,

Good fruit makes not the tree good nor euel fruit the evil tree / but a good
tree bears good fruit and an evil tree euel fruit.

A good man can not do euel works nor an euel man good works / for a good tree
can not bear euel fruit nor an euel tree good fruit.

A man is good ere he do good works and euel ere he do euel works / for the
tree is good ere he bear good fruit / and euel ere it here euel fruit.

Every man is either good or evil.
Every tree is either good or euel either make ye the tree good and the fruit
good also / or else make the tree evil and the fruit of it lykwyse euel.

Every man's works are either good or evil.
For all fruit trees are either good or euel. Either make ye the tree good and
the fruit good also / or else make the tree evil and the fruit of it likewise
euel. A good man is known by his works for a good man does good works and an
euel euel works / Mat. 7.
ye shall know the^ by their fruit / for a good tree bears good fruit / and an
euel tree euel fruit.

A man is lykened to the tree and his works to the fruit of the tree.
Beware of the false prophets which come to you in shepes clothyng / but
inwardly they are reuenyng wolves. ye shall know them by their fruits.

None of our works nether save us nor condemn us.
It is proved that no works make us nether ryghtwyse nor vnryghtwyse / good
nor euel / but first we are good ^^ we do good works and euel (...) euel
works / ergo no works neither save us nor conde^pne us. Thou wylt say / the^
makes it no matter what we to. I answer / yes. For if thou do euel / it is a
sure argument that thou art euel / and want the faith. If thou do good it
is an argument that thou art good and have the faith / for a good tree bears
good fruit and an euel tree euel fruit / yet good fruit makes not the tree good
/ nor euel fruit the tree euel so the man is good ere he do good deeds and euel
ere he do euel deeds. The man is the tree / his works ar the fruit. Faith
makes the good tree and incredulyte the euel tree / such a tree such fruit / such
a man such works. For all that is done in faith pleases god and are good
works. And all that is done with out faith dyspleaseth god and are evil works.

who so ever believes or thinks to be saved his works denyethe that Christ
is his savior / that Christ died for him and all thing that pertayneth to
Christ.
For how is he thy savior / if thou might save thy self by thy works? or
whereto should he dye for the if any works might have saved the? what is this
to say / Christ dyed for the? verily that is / thou should have dyed
perpetualy / and christ to deliver the fro that death / dyed for the and
changed thy perpetual death i^ to his own death For thou made the fault / and
he suffered the pain, and that for the love he had to the ere ever thou wast
borne when thou had done nether good nor euel. Now since he has paid thy
det thou nedest not: no thou can not / but should be dampened if his blood
were not. But since he was punyshed for the thou shall not be punyshed. Finally
/ he has delivered the from thy conde^pnacyon and all euel / and desires
naught else of the but that thou wylt aknowlege what he has done for the and
bear it in mind / and that thou would help other for his sake both in
word and deed / even as he has helped the for naught and with out reward.

O now ready would we be to help other / if we knew his goodness (...)ent
leaves toward us. He is a good and a gentle lord for he does al for nou^ht
Let us I beseech you follow hy^ ^^^^steppes whom all the world ought to praise
and worshipe. Amen.

He that thinks to be saue^ (...) works calls him self Christ.

For he calls him self his sauyoure which pertayneth to Christ only what is
a savior but he that saves / and he says I save my self / which is as
much to say as I am Christ for Christ only is the savior of the world.

we should do no good works for the intent to get the inherytaunce of heaven
or remyssion of syn.
For who so ever believes to get the ^^^eritaunce of heaven or remyssion of
sin through works / he believes not to get that for Christ's sake. And they
that believe not that their sins are forgiven the^ and that they shall be saved
for Christ's sake they believe not the gospel. For the gospel says / you
shall be saved for Christ's sake / your sins are forgiven for Christ's sake.
He that believes not ye gospel believes not god So it follows that they
which believe to be saved by their works or to get remyssyon of their sins
by their own deeds believe not god: but recou^te him as a liar and so utterly
deny him to be god. Thou wylt say / shall we the^ do no good deeds? I say not so
but I say we should do no good works for ^he intent to get the inherytaunce of
heaven or remyssyon of syn. For if we believe to get the inherytaunce of heaven
through good works, then we believe not to get it through the promise of god: if
we think to get remyssyo^ of our syn then we believe not that they are forgeuen
us / and so we count god a liar. For god sayethe / you shall have the
enherytaunce of heaven for my sons sake / thy sins ar^ forgiven the for my
sons sake and you say it is not so / but I will win it through my works So
I conde^pne not good deeds / But I conde^pne the false trust in any works /
for all the works that a man puts confydence in are therewith poisoned and
become euel. Therefore do you good works but beware you do the^ not to get any
good through that / for if thou do / thou receuest the good not as the gift of
god but as der to the and make thy self fellow with god because thou wylt
take nothing of him for naught what neadeth he any thing of theyres which
gives al thing and is not the pourer? Therefore do no thing to him but take of
him / for he is a gentle lord / and with a glader wyll-geueth us all that we
need / the^ we take it of him / therefore if we wat ought let us wit our selves
Preasse not the^ to the enherytaunte of heaven through presumption of thy good
works for if thou do / thou countest thy self holy and egal to him because
thou wylt take nothing (...) him for naught: and so shall thou (...) lucifer
fell for his pride.
