The three merry Cobblers,
Who tell how the case with them does stand,
How they are still on the mending hand.
To the tune of The Spanish Gypsy.
COme follow fellow me,
to the Alehouse we will march all three,
Leave Aule Last Thread, and Lether,
And let us go altogether.
Our trade excells most trades ith'land,
For we are st^ll on the mending hand.
Come Tapster fill us some ale,
Then hearken to our tale,
And try what can be made
Of our renowned trade;
We have Aule at our command,
And still we are on the mending hand.
Though Shoomakers us disdain,
Yet it is approved plain,
Our trade cannot be mist,
Let them say what they list,
Though all grow worse quite through the land,
Yet we are still on the mending hand.
When Shoomakers are decayed:
Then do they fall to our trade,
And glad their minds they give
By mending Shoes to live,
When in necessity they stand,
They strive to be on the mending hand.
Although there is but few of us rich,
Yet bravely we go through stich.
Were It not for this barley broth
(Which is meat, drink and cloth)
We sure should purchase house and land,
At worst we are still on the mending hand.
We deal most uprightly,
Our neighbors that go awry
We easily set upright,
The broken we unite,
When all men out of order stand;
Then we are most on the mending hand:
We cannot dissemble for treasure,
But give every one just measure,
If Bakers kept size like us,
They need not be frighted thus,
We fear not to have our doings scanned,
For we are still on the mending hand.
What ever we do intend
We bring to a perfect end.
If any offense be past,
We make all well at last,
We sit at work when others stand,
And still we are on the mending hand.
We bristle as well as the best,
All knavery we do detest,
What we have promised
We Will do unto a thread,
We use wax but to seal no Band,
And still we are on the mending hand.
Our wives do sit at the wheel,
They spin, and we do reele,
Although we take no Farms,
Yet we can show our arms,
And spread them at our own command.
Thus still we are on the mending hand.
The second Part.
To the same Tune.
Poor weather-beaten Soles,
Whose case the body condoles,
We for a little gain
Can set on foot again.
We make the falling steadfast stand,
And still we are on the mending hand.
You Would think we were past sense,
For we give pieces for pence,
Judge, is it not very strange
We should make such exchange,
Yet so we will do at your command,
And yet we will be on the mending hand.
Our hands do show that we
Live not by taking a Fee,
We pull a living forth
Of things but little worth,
Our work does th'owners understand,
Thus still we are on the mending hand.
All day we merrily sing,
And Customers do bring,
Or unto us do send,
Their Boots and Shoes to mend,
We have our money at first demand,
Thus still we are on the mending hand.
When all our money is spent,
We are not discontent,
For we can work for more,
And then pay off our score,
We drink without either bill or band,
Because we are still on the mending hand.
While other Callings great,
For fraud and foul deceit,
Are looked unto by Law,
We need not weigh't a straw,
Our honesty spreads through the land,
For we are still on the mending hand.
Therefore let us be of good cheer,
Though Lether be something dear,
The Law some course will take
Amends for all to make,
And by their care we understand,
the world is now on the mending hand,
We pray for durty weather,
And money to pay for Lether,
Which if we have, and health,
A fig for worldly wealth,
Till men upon their heads do stand,
We shall be still on the mending hand.
FINIS.
