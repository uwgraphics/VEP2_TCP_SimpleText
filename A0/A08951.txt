The distressed Virgin: OR, The false Young Man, and the constant Maid, The
qualities of them both displaid.
To an excellent new Tune.




A Thousand times my love commend,
to him that has my heart in hold,
I took him for my dearest friend,
his Love I more esteemed than Gold.
When that mine did eyes see his face,
and that mine ears had heard his voice,
His Love I freely did embrace,
my heart told me he was my choice.
O had he still continued true,
and in affection permanent,
Had he performed what was due,
then had I found true hearts content:
But he, regardlesse of his vow,
which he did make to me before,
Has thus in sorrow left me now,
my former follies to deplore.
Would I had never seen those eyes,
that (like attractive Adamants)
Did my poor heart with love surprise,
the power of love so me enchants.
I have no power to leave his love,
though with stern hate he me pursue.
To him I will most constant prove,
though he be faithless and untrue.
I put my finger unto the bush,
thinking the sweetest Rose to find,
I pricked my finger to the bone,
and yet I left the Rose behind:
If Roses be such prickling flowers,
they must be gathered when tha're green,
But she that loves an unkind Love,
alas, she rows against the stream,
Oh, would he but conceive aright,
the grief that I for him sustain,
He could not choose but change his spite
to faithful love, and leave disdain.
I love to have him still in place,
his too long absence makes me mourn,
Yet he disdaines to see my face,
and holds my company in scorn.
It grieves my heart full sore to think,
that he whom I so dearly love,
Should thus refuse with me to drink,
yet can my passion never remove:
Though he, I know, could wish my death,
so great is his inveterate hate,
Yet I could sooner lose my breath,
than see him wronged in name or state.
Ill haphad I to come in place,
where first I saw his tempting look,
As soon as I beheld his face,
I Cupids prisoner straight was took:
And never since that fatal hour
I have enjoyed one minutes rest,
The thought of him is of such power,
it never can forsake my breast.
Then was I struck with Cupids Dart,
then was my fancy captivated,
Then did I vow that still my heart
should rest with him though me he hated:
Then did he make a show of love,
which did much more my heart inflame,
But now he does perfidious prove,
and gives me cause his love to blame.
The second part, To the same tune.




NAy more, he made a vow to me,
that I should be his wedded wife,
And he forsakes me now I see,
which makes me weary of my life:
I little thought what now I find,
that youngmen could dissemble so,
Sure he is the falsest of his kind,
ill hap have I to prove him so.
Could any man be so hard hearted,
to leave a harmless Maid in grief:
From me all comfort clean is parted,
unless his favor grant relief.
He is the man that bred my pain,
he is the man whose love alone
Must be the salve to cure my pain,
or else my life will soon be gone.
O faithless wretch, consider well
that Heaven abhors perjury:
Great torments are prepared in Hell
for them that thus will swear and lie.
Oh had thou never made a show
of love, thou had excused thy blame:
But thy false heart full well does know
what oaths thy perjured tongue did frame.
That obstacle that hinders me
is that which I suspect full sore:
His fruit grows on some other tree,
and he is seduced by some whore:
Or else he has some other Less,
perhaps like me, a harmless Maid,
Whom he may bring to such a pass,
as I am brought by Cupids aid.
Oh Heavens forbid that any one,
that bears an honest loving mind,
Should thus have cause to grieve and moan,
for such a knave that shames his kind.
But why should I as passions move,
with bitter words upon him rail,
Whom I am ever bound to love,
until my vital spirits fail.
Sweet Love forgive my lavish tongue,
if I offend in any sort:
To recompense thee for that wrong,
I Will always give thee good repo^t,
Although to me thou art unkind,
who never gave thee any cause:
Yet I am still resolved in mind,
never to break God Cupids Laws.
And if I never be thy wife,
(which is the thing I justly claim)
I vow to live a single life,
and never think of Lovers game.
But why speak I of life, when death
does every minute claim his due?
I cannot long retain my breath,
having a Lover so untrue.
Let all true Lovers judge aright,
in what a case poor soul am I:
Come gentle death, and work thy spite,
for now I am prepared to dye:
O Heaven forgive my Love his wrong,
done unto me a Maiden pure,
Who for his sake must dye erelong.
for long my life cannot endure.
