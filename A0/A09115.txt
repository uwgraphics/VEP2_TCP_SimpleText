THE PRAEFACE.
COnsider well and weygh,
what castles, towers and towns,
What realms, what Kings by cruel Mars,
have lost their royal crowns.
The force of war each man,
has felt, this well I know:
If ever he in Martial feats,
did any time bestow.
How many headless men,
what towns destroyed be?
If stories old then do reuolue,
there plainly may thou see.
This story I therefore,
in English have translate:
Because thereby thou may perceive,
of war the cruel fate.
How Mars with bloody sword,
does raunge when victory:
Shall open her gates, and let him in,
to have the maysterie.
What Princes blood is spilt,
of captives woeful case:
And how that traitors use their sleyghts
their Princes to deface.
To the Reader.
Lo here thou shall it see,
by Caulcas traitor old:
Which to the Greeks a Princes child,
by trayterie has sold.
I have in time heard say,
how men that did delight:
To read old iestes of battayles old,
did much desire the sight,
Of books that did entreat,
of Hectors courage stout:
How in the midst of all the Greeks,
with valiant heart he fought.
Lo here thou may perceive,
in Hectors little son:
The courage of his father old,
and what he often has done.
Buy therefore and it read,
the price of it is small:
If ought there be in it amiss,
amend it soon I shall.
Thus I take here my leave,
requiring this of thee:
That thou accept here my good will,
though rude the verses be.
The history of two of the most noble Princes of the world Astianax and
Polixena
WHen Troie we Troianes were inclosde,
by mighty armies twain:
And weery Greeks forsook that land,
retourning home again.
By their devise a monster huge,
was left in Trojan ground:
A plain disceyte them to destroy,
as afterward they found.
A horse of wood, in which there was,
of armed men great store:
Ulysses and the offspring of,
the huge and bristled bore.
When that these Knights in armor bright
enclosed were therein:
To Tenedos not far from thence,
to go they do begin.
A place in sight of Trojan land,
where men them might not see:
Because of mistes which caused were,
unto the Skies to fly.
These Gretians there themselves did hide,
and Phrygians did begin:
By force of men, the ingine great,
to hale and pluck it in.
With minstrels and with trompets eke,
and feast this night they make:
And fearing naught that might ensue,
their quiet restes they take.
When half the night was spent in flepe,
at Troie the Greeks ariue:
Then those that in the ingine were.
their fires forth do drive.
To top of tower these fires they flewe,
the houses eke below:
And what within the ingine was,
the Gretians plain do show.
Then straight the Troianes all in heaps,
unto the court do fly:
And eke the rowte of Gretians stout,
Aeneas does defy.
And seeks with manly courage stout,
the Greeks for to restrain:
But out alas, his noble heart,
did travail all in vain.
For more and more the Greeks did yet,
their number multiply:
That succor ought to Troie should come,
the Gods did plain deny.
And cruel fates that were peruers,
to Troianes as I deem:
The Trojan town old Illyon,
did naught at all esteem.
And when that once Neptunes hand,
the walls at will to beat:
And cruel Juno in the toil.
did labor till she sweat.
And all the Gretian Gods at once,
do give them to the spoil:
Both Iuppiter and cruel Mars,
Lieutenant of the broyle.
There men might see the Trojan walls,
turnde topsie turuie down:
And at this breach the Gretians keep,
to enter in the town.
Here now they win the victory,
and there to ground they fall:
And some unto the temples run,
upon the Gods to call,
For aid and help, but all in vain,
the town is quite destroyde:
And for the spoil their labor all,
is duly now employed.
There Priamus the ancient King,
by Pyrrus hand is slain:
And here the Greeks the castle strong,
endeavor to obtain.
The town once won, then all in haste,
they run to take the spoil:
And here and there the Troianes do,
of Gretians take the foil.
At length the town is put to sack,
and all as dead does lie:
And then the Greeks do straight prepare,
to Greece again to hie.
And Agamemnon general,
does part the spoil and gain:
And eke the captives they do seek,
to Greece with them to train.
While all these things in Trojan land,
were thus commit and done:
Dauphebus in the Zodiac,
had more than half outrunne.
And running now another way,
did call for Winter days:
To which time mighty Aeolus,
naught of his power decays.
Then homeward do the Greeks prepare,
to wend in very deed:
And first to get the spoil to ships,
they forward do proceed.
Some now do rigge and tallowe eke,
the ships that beaten were:
With wind and rain, and other some,
the mighty mastes do rear.
Some scour the gons, some tackels new,
some vitailes do provide:
And some full ready are to wend,
yet lack they wind and tide.
The Gretian Princes them disporte,
in midst of Prygian land:
And woeful Troianes in the midst,
with wringing hands do stand.
Before the end of dolours all,
in sight there did appear:
A manly Knight in armor bright,
And spoke these words unto the host,
of Gretians stout and strong:
You have my Knights, within this land,
remained very long.
And now at length you have repayde,
the Trojans once their hire.
For not one stone on others left,
now all lies in the mire.
Therefore I say attend to me,
and answer quickly give:
You know the maid whose wedlock I,
did crave when I did live.
With that they all astonished were,
and mused who should be:
The wight whose love he did desire,
in his prosperity.
At last, he to dissolve them from,
this fear that they were in:
And then a new to prosecute,
this tale he does begin.
Achilles I your Champion old,
that sometime was your King,
Now being dead yet do request,
of you but this one thing.
That Polixena may be mine,
and on my tomb be slain:
So shall your ships return full safe,
unto your friends again.
And losed be from long decay,
the which here they abide:
With painted pomp, and shall again,
upon the salt seas slide.
And more I will and do command,
that she to death be put:
And then your ships shall losed be,
the foming seas to cut.
By Pyrrus hand I will that she,
be slain, and then depart:
And then ye have the Troianes paid,
after their own desert.
This said, the earth did quake, and down,
to hell he did descend:
The Greeks his words for to perform,
do thoroughly intend.
Then to their ships the Greeks do hie,
in posting wise amain:
For weather fair did then appear,
to bring them home ogayne.
Ulysses then, whose devilish wiles,
were not far of to seek:
Did this procure, that Hectors son,
should die in manner like.
Astianax that manly wight,
yet being but a child:
Could not forbear, he seeing that
from Troie he was exilde.
But willingly his tender corpse,
for countries soil would bear:
Through all the rowte of Gretians strong,
which Ulysses did fear.
And practizing to have him slain,
for fear he should in end:
Be able with an army huge,
through Gretian land to wend.
And then his children after him,
by force for to subdewe:
And eke destroy all Gretian land,
as they had ouerthrewe,
The Trojan town old Illyon,
as men thereof may see:
Ulysses and Caulcas therefore,
hereon agreed be.
That Caulcas shall adjure and swear,
that one there must be slain:
For whom the Greeks do make delay,
and still in creek remain.
The night is past, the day is come,
auroraes beams do spread:
And now Caulcas that traitor old,
does rise from drowsy bed.
And stands at aultare twixt the Gods,
to offer sacrifice:
With foming mouth the Heyfer young,
before the altar lies.
Much like as when a raging bore,
compast with any wight:
And stricken to the heart with shafte,
of force must lie upright.
And foming at his cruel mouth,
he wrastles all in vain:
The more he strives, the more increases,
his sore and grievous pain*
So lies the Heyfer young before,
the altar of the Gods:
His breathing paunch is opened,
the blood runs forth with clods.
Then cries out the Prophet old,
and says that needs must we:
Slay Hectors son, for lo the Gods,
with us agrieued be.
And nothing can appease their ire,
but only sacrifice:
And therefore Astianax must be slain,
I say in any wise.
Then straight from thence to seek the boy
the Gretians do them hie:
But for a time him for to find,
the God does them deny.
Till at the last that crafty King,
trained up with all disceyte:
Did find him out, as one that knew,
the way him for to get.
At length when they obtained had,
this peerless Princes child:
Toward they do commit the boy,
and eke the Aunte so mild.
Until such time as poynted was,
by Caulcas traitor old:
The which thing he before, within
his traitors head had fold.
Aurora twice had showed her face,
and Tytan twice in Skies:
Has showed his glistering beams from out
the side where he does rise.
And now the third to men is come,
whereof they did rejoice:
With merry notes the Mariners,
do sing with cheerful voice.
At last this Hector young of years,
does joy, and hastes with speed:
Of cruel fate for to receive,
his final end in deed.
Then strait the Greeks and Troianes run
to place where he should die:
And who first at the place should be,
the Greeks and Troianes try.
Some by the castle wall do stand,
and some heap stones on hie:
And some from top of Idamon,
do see where he shall lie.
Some gather stones, and pyles do make,
thereon to stand and see:
Some other weep at his ill fate,
appointed so to be.
Some talk of Hectors valiantness,
some come with him behind:
Some that Ulysses neck were broke,
wish both in heart and mind.
And still they stand and gaze upon,
the old and rotten toure:
And do aspect of Mars his stroke,
when that shall come the flower.
At length he coms that causer was,
of Greeks so long delay:
And Greeks with Troianes all at once,
lamen^ that doleful day.
The manly boy with manly heart,
unto his death does go:
And rolls about his seemly eyes,
his friends and foes to know.
Unto the top of Castle old,
the Greeks and he do wend:
And from the hiest top thereof,
they downewarde do him send.
The tender corpse of Princes blood,
and Illyons only joy:
In whom his hope did all consist,
for to repair old Troie,
Does now in midst of Illyon town,
lie quite dissolved of life:
The mourning now who can express,
of noble Hectors wife.
The Greeks lament his woeful hap,
with tears their eyes do flow:
And eke how Troianes do lament,
my pen can not forth show,
They houle, they weep, they mourn and cry
they wring their hands amayne:
To see how that the tender corpse,
of that sweet Prince lies slay^^
At length the Greeks do down descend,
Polixenaes death to see:
But Agamemnon in whom does grow,
the branch of fair pity,
Does Greeks deny that they should see,
the fall of her likewise:
And for the death of Hectors son,
the tears run down his eyes.
Then Pyrrus he with posting speed,
and Gretians all do hie:
Unto the place where as Iwis,
Polixena must die.
The Gretians do run amain,
and Trojans be not slow:
The company, the poynted place,
do throng and ouerflowe.
The number was with wayling fillde,
to see so fair a wight:
In pitious wise for slaughter huge,
so cruelly to be dight.
At length they come, and Hellyn she,
does bear the marriage brande:
Before the maid, as manner was,
with stretched arm and hand.
The maid with manly courage stout,
does view the mighty train:
With stern aspect, reuoluing here
her sight and there again.
With bended brows she viewes the host
of Gretians as she goes:
And yet for that with Tyndaris,
not one foot she does lose.
But is as lusty in her way,
as best of Gretians all:
No cruel dread durst once assay,
within her bones to fall.
And after her in order commes,
Achilles only son:
Which must the maid on fathers tomb,
with sword quite through run.
And Caulcas eke did after come,
but yet with slower pace:
The maid before the rest she went,
whose glistering golden face,
Did quite excel the bright sun beams,
of Phoebus fresh and fair:
Which good cause gave the Gretian host,
upon her so to stare.
Her comely hair depending down,
behind her head did show:
Her perfect graces what they were,
in which she full did flow.
Her face as Roses fresh and sweet,
did seem that there were plaste:
Her tender lips, her body eke,
in kirtle being last.
Her fingers long and lyllie white,
yea even as the snow:
Dame nature in Polixena,
her power at once did show.
No part of her misseshapen was,
but all full well did gree:
Which caused of the Greeks to weep,
her cruel chance to see.
It would have made a heart of flint,
to weep or else to burst:
To see so fair a Lady die,
as one that was accurste.
Now is she come unto the tomb,
of hie and stout Achil,
The Gretians all then of the Gods,
the (...) ears do fill.
With roarings and with cries also,
even as a mother would:
When that even now her child to die,
before her see she should.
So do the Greeks and Trojans all,
lament her cruel fall:
And often for help, but yet in vain,
unto the Gods they call.
And then to top of tomb she goes,
and there as still does stand:
As any lamb, which to be slain,
the butcher has in hand.
Then down she kneeles and prays ye Gods,
and then does rise again:
And every man to hear her speak,
approach and are full feign.
Then thus to them at last she spoke,
all fear now laid aside:
Leave of quoth she, I say you Greeks,
leave of your filthy pride.
The crown of victory the which,
you now triumphant bear:
For if you look never so hie,
yet fortune does
To throw you down unto the earth,
that erst she set on hie:
And yet O Troie I now joy much,
that I with thee must die.
I shall not wander into Greece,
nor as a slave ywis:
Be bound with chains in prison strong,
as now the manner is.
But with my father and my friends,
shall here abide I say:
Now welcome O thou death to me,
I joy to see this day.
With that Achilles son,
plucked forth his bloody blade:
Her pleasant corpse intending then,
by sword for to invade.
Then lifting up his hand to strike,
he stayed in the blow:
For cruel fear in quaking bones,
entangled had him so.
At length he quite desolued from fear,
does hyde his sword within:
Her tender ribs, her breathing blood,
(...) begin.
And yet not dead, she falls as though,
the burden she would make:
Full heavy to Achilles, then,
there life she does forsake.
And then the blood out of the wound,
in breathing wise does flow:
Even as a flood out from the hills,
descending down below.
Then all the shores is through complete,
with weepings manifold,
The Greeks they weep her cruel fate,
on that wise to behold.
From thence they go unto their ships,
and homeward think to wend:
The ships be losde, and fate reuolued,
fair wind the Gods have send.
Then hoyse they sail, away they (...)
to see once Greece again:
And leaving Troie on foming (...)
they ride and sail ama^^^
