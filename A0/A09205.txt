THALIAS BANQVET: Furnished with an hundred and odd dishes of newly devised
Epigrammes, Whereunto (beside many worthy friends) are invited all that love in
offensive mirth, and the Muses.

By H. P.

LONDON, Printed by NICHOLAS OAKS, for Francis Constable, dwelling in Paul's
Churchyard, at the sign of the white Lion. 1620.

TO THE MOST HONORABLY MINDED and best deserving of the Muses, Mr. DRV D^VRY,
of Riddlesworth, in the Coun^y of Norfolk.
HONORED SIR,
MY THALIA well knowing that you are the Tr^asu^er of the Shire, for that (I
mean not money) which a number want, is bold (if her pasport be not ^ut of
date) to visit you in her journey: she knows you, she tells me, for your
exc^llent parts from among five hundred, and is verily persuaded you will stand
her friend. Her entertai^ement ^^^^erto has been none of the best, which I
can impute to no other thing, then as in Barbary the ^^^rility of the Soil,
otherwise rich enough. Sir, in b^i^fe, she is sure you are the man can judge:
to put her self upon the Country, were to appeal to IGNORANCE, and hazard her
Inno^ence, which dare^ approach even the most severe Tribun^ll: whatsoever she
is, she submits her self unto your censure; in the mean time, humbly
requesting you to take the praeemenince (as you deserve) and vpper-end of ^er
Table, she takes leave,

Who with my self, shall ever be devoted yours, HENRY PEACHAM.

THALIA loquitur.
VVElcome, welcome to our feast,
Every understanding guest,
From the Colledg^ and the Hall,
Welcome Academicks all,
Britains Magazins of Wit,
Iunes of Court repa^re to it,
And come Courtiers ye that be
The Mirror of fair courtesy,
Citizens ye that were made
As well for learning as for trade,
Come brave spirits of the Real^e,
Vnshaded of the ACADEME
That in the Country there and here,
Like stars in midst of Clouds appear.
M^ke no st^y for man by nature
Is a sociable Creature:
And brave Soldiers take a truce,
A while to revel with his Muse,
Since our ^^^hor has borne Arms too,
He cannot choose but welcome you:
Come far Ladies ye that will,
Here is naught obscure or ill,
And your ^^^ds Attendants, (...) ^
Witty wenches let them come,
By CYRRHA they shall welcome be,
To my Poet and to me,
My banquet is prepared for WIT,
Not FOLLY dare to touch a bit.
To my Reader. Epigram 1.
REader, if that thy curious eye will needs
Dwell on a while these rude and ranker weeds,
Take leave; and ere a while this Muse of ours
Shall bring thee lapfuls of her choicest flowers.
Upon TVLLVS. Epigram 2.
TVLLVS who was a Tailor by pro^ession,
Is late turned Lawyer, and of large possession:
^o who before did cut but country freeze,
Now cuts the Country in excessive fees.
To LAELIVS. Epigram 3.
Pri'thee LAELIVS do^ me but the grace,
TO express thy self in that above thy gate
(...) written, Here we have no dwelling place:
that, do thou mean, our worldly fickle state,
Or rather (which I take to be the right)
Thou can endure no guest above a night?
Upon FVMOSO. Epigram 4.
FVMOSO now beginning to decline
Takes only care how he may come by coin,
And daily wishes these BOHEMIAN ^arres
Would set all Christendom at deadly wars,
For him it were better vpsie Gull does swear,
Moreover England very well might spare
Ten hundred thousand men, enough to bea^,
The Emperor, Pope and Turk out of his seat:
Not that FVMOSO, trust me, means to fight,
Or dares march further then his chymneie^ sight,
A noted coward, but the truth to tell,
^e hat^ a rusty musket he would sell.
To Mr. B^N IOHN^ON: Epigram 5.
SInce more cannot be added to thy Fame,
Enough it is only to express thy Name.
To Mr. I. Seldom of the Inner Temple. Epigram 6^
Look how a late-come Painter to the strand
Does foremost place the Pour^raicture in ^ight^
Of some remarqued Statesman of our Land,
To grace his shop, and buyers to inuit;
So learned Sir, I here prefixe your n^me,
And look to thrive the better for the same^
To Mr. Edward Hayward. ^pigram 7.
I Know it were but highly to offend,
To sever you si^, from so true a friend,
When eue^ ENVY is enforced to bless
Your (^ach enjoying either) Happiness.
Upon LAVINA. Epigram 8.
LLAVINA brought abed, her husband looks,
To knowe's child's fortune throughout his books:
His neighbors think he had need search backward rather,
And learn for certain who had been the father.
Upon DARE an vpstart Poet. Epigram 9.
DARE a fresh Author to a fri^nd did boast,
He Would show in Cheap his name upon a post,
But did DARE^ friend to's hostess house but walk,
Shee'ld shew'^ him there on every post in chalk.
Upon TAMB^RRO. Epigram 10.
TAM^VRRO now, what ere his friends do say,
At last will thrive, and all his debts go pay,
For by his wit (he boasts) and pleasing tongue,
H^hath won a ^ench that is wondrous fair and young,
Well borne, well qualified, rich, modest, wise,
And shall be worth, if that an Uncle dies,
In land four hundred by the year, at least,
Beside odd remnants in her mothers chest:
It Is true, the match is half concluded, he
Is wondrous willing with it, but not she.
Upon SORANZO. Epigram 11.
SOR^NZO'S broad-brimm'd hat I often compare
To the vast compass of the heavenly sphaere,
His head, the Ea^th's Globe fixed under it,
Whose Center i^ his wondrous little wit.
To VFLLIVS. Epigram 12.
Thou swear'st I bowl as well as most men do,
The most are bunglers^ therein thou ^aist true.
Epigram 13.
THe Country, God be thanked, well is rid
Of Beggars, which, they say, Judge ^opham did:
But if he could the Court as well have f^e^d,
Then he had done a worthy Act indeed.
Upon the Turkish Alkar^n. Epigram ^4.
TThe Turks hold this opinion very odd,
That madme^s souls are talking still with God,
And that to be an Ideo^ o^ a Vice,
Is the only way ^o purchase Paradis^
If t^is be true their Alka^ons relate,
Our Puritans were sure in happy state.
Upon BOON. Epigram 15.
When unto Boon a book was brought to swear,
He prayed the Judge he would that labor spare,
For there is no oath (quoth Boon) that you can n^me^
But perfect I wit^out book have the same.
In Diuites. Epigram 16.
RIch men their wealth as children ra^^les keep,
When played a while with it, then ^hey fall asleep.
Upon Richard. Epigram 17.
THrough Paul's Churchyard as Dick came reeling drun^,
He stumbling fell into an empty trunk,
And lain a while did verily suppose,
He had been buried quick and in his clothes,
Save that the upper stone upon his grave,
By night was stolen by some cunning knave.
Dick half awake, be^hought him of his si^ne,
And that lewd course of life he lived in,
Yet long hereof for thi^st Dick could not think,
But drawer cries, now for thy smallest drink.
Upon Gellia. Epigram 18.
When G^llia went to school and was a girl,
Her teeth for whitenes might compare with pearl,
But after she the taste of swee^e meats knew,
They turned all Opals to a pe^fect blew,
Now Gellia t^kes Tobacco, what should let,
But last they should conue^^ed be to let?
Upon Nasu^o. Epigram 19.
When at the Table once I did auerre,
Well taken Discords best did please the ear,
And would be judged by any Qu^rister,
Were in the Chapel, Paul's or Westmi^ster,
Nasuto sitting at the nether end,
(First having drun^e and cough'd) quoth he my friend,
If that were true, my wife and I, I fear,
Should soon be sent for to the Archdukes Quire.
Upon the A^se. Epigram 20.
THe A^se a Courtier on a time would be,
And trauaild foreign fashions for to see,
But home returned, foshi^n he could none,
Hi^ mane and tail were only larger grown.
Upon Virtue, Mistrisse Milla's maid. Epigram 21.
Says Aris^otle, Virtue ought to be
Communic^^iue of her self and free,
And has not V^rtue Milla's maid been so,
Who Is grown hereby as big as she can go?
To the nobly-disposed, modest, and fair Sisters, M^^stresse Aleezia, and my
euer-honored Mistress, Mist^esse Anne Dudley. Epigram 22.
IF to admire and tell the world ye are,
Of all I know (sweet Maids) above compare,
For bounty, beauty, wit, and goodly grace,
Th'extracted quint'sence of your noble race,
Would pay that everlasting sum I ow
To your respectfull favors well I know^
I should as much add to your worth as he
That guilds his di'mond, inke^ the Iuorie,
And by these Titles rather you dishonor,
Which every waiting maid has pinned upon her
Now by her Masters Clarke; since praises common
As perruke^ are grown stale with every woman.
So let me thrive as ever I abuse
Chaste Poesy, and prostitute my Muse,
T'vnworthinesse, or follow the hot sent
Of rising Greatness, with the rablement,
Or letter of an idle name rehearse,
Tha^'s empty of Desert in all my verse.
To the learned and every way accomplished, Sir Hamond Strange, Knight.
E^igram 23.
SIr, though you are a stranger to our time,
And live a far as in another clime,
Our Muse her flight with nimble wing does take,
To gratulate you for good Letters sake;
"So with the same stone needles touched, agree,
"And hold one motion, though remote they ^ee.
Upon a Spanish Soldier. Epigram 24.
A Spanish Soldier sick unto the death,
His Pistol to's Physician did bequeath,
Who did demand, what should the reason be,
Above other things to give him that (quoth he)
This with you^ practice joined you, may kill,
Sir, all alive, and have the world at will.
To Laura. Epigram 25^
IF true as common that old proverb be,
A black man is in beautie^ eye a pearl;
To prove thy self as fair as any she,
Then Laura love, and live with me my girl.
Upon Count Surly. Epigram 26.
COunt Surly will no scholar entertain,
Or any wiser then himself, ^ow ^o?

His wit amongst them, makes a goodly show.
Upon Corydon. Epigram 27.
A Home-spunne peasant in his manner rude,
His Urine brought close stopped in a glass,
Unto his Doctor, who when it had viewed,
Demanded straight what countrieman he was,
Quoth Corydon, with making legs full low,
Your worship that shall by my water know.
Upon Otho. Epigram 28.
THree daughters Ot^^ has his only heirs
But will by no mean^s h^^^ the^ l^arne to write,
Cause (after hi^ own^ humou^) (...) he fears,
The'^l one day lea^ne lo^^ l^t^^^s to ^ndi^^,
The young^st now is with ^hild, ^ho taught her th^n,
Or of her self learned she to hold her pen?
To the Noble minded and most worthy, Master Thomas Knyvet of Ashwel^h^rp.
Epigram 29.

To Master William Baker, S^cretarie unto my L. G. of Cantuarburie. Epigram 33.
SIr midst the great employments and the toil,
That do distract you in affairs of State,
Remit your cares and high raisd thoughts a while,
And see what Flo^ers our ba^ren soil o^ late,
Vnth^ught of h^^h prod^c'd, or rather weeds,
That show the^^ head^ before the better seeds.
Though like a cuning Herbalist you know,
Such have their s^as^ns and their virtues all,
Yet if you find that herein ought does grow
Vnwh^lesome, ill, I Will h^^l^ it over the wall.
Wh^le others censure gl^dly w^e do hear,
Your judgment only puts v^ in a fea^e.
To Master Christopher Sherland of Graies Inn. Epigram 34.
Beloved Sir, since you have followed me,
In your unthought of Journey thorough France,

By thrift the only travail of our days.
Upon an Italian Proverb. Epigram 35.

And made a fourth, there might have been a Fair:

Examind him one day upon their Fai^e.
And ^old him how ^he neighbors did complain
Abhominably of his negligence,
And that within a while he must be fa^e
Provide him el^ewhere, and be packin^ thence.
An Alderman who seemed was his friend,
This hearing, humble Master Mayor did pray,
He might stay still, because he could commend
Hi^ diligence, what ^'re the rest did say.
For (I quoth he) have three boys of mine own,
And towardly who sons though I say it that should not,
That now these ten years with Sir H^gh have gone^
And at their coming first unto h^^ ^ould not

Take them who dares at nine-ho^^^, cards or ca^.

And lose his land, with speed to get him knighted.
Upon Rosimus. Epigram 60.

Upon Sir R. Epigram 61.

Thou wantst no learning (in thy shop I mean.)
Upon Gloriosos house. Epigram 66.
SEe ye yon brave house which Glorioso built,
Another Babell to diuulge hi^ name,
Or rather Babble with the tu^^et^ guilt,
An hundred smokeles chymneies in the same,
Whose frontispice is window all and glass,
That does both highway and the town affront,
As if it bade obeisance to the Ass
Sir Coun^er-Puffe who is the owner on it.
You Would little think that Barley and the Beant,
Affordes their purest manchet when they dine;
And that their only curre is grown so lean,
He is not able for to hold a Swine,
While he and^s Mule lie in the City stabled,
All winter long to avoid the parish poor;
His coltes and grooms though yonder still are tabled^
The dog, a girl, the shepherd, and no more.
Upon the God-dammee's band. Epigram 67.
WHat is the reason of God-dammee's band
Inch deep, and that his fashion does not alter?
God-dammee saues a labor, understand,
In pulling't off when he puts on the halter:
Upon two Ladi^s. Epigram 68.
TWo City Ladies pendants of the Court,
Where late I lived, did commonly resort;
And in the garden one day as they walked,
Thus gathering flowers each to either talked^
What lives (good Lord) these Country creatures lead,
Over one of us within the City bred?
What dainty flowers, what arbors, walks, and trees,
Poor souls they have; and look where stand the bees^
Goodness a me, see Madam where Thrist grows,
My Sweet-hart loves not it should ^ouch his nose^
And by my patience, quoth the other, I
A^ ill abide this scuruy Honesty,
It bears no flower, nor carrie^ any smell,
Yet Country Ladies wear't and like it well.
To my Reader. Epigram 69.
MY Person is another as I list,
I now but act the Epigramma^ist.
To my towardly and hopeful Scholar Master Edward Chamberlain of Barnham
Broom. Epigram 70.
NED, never look again those days to see,
Thou liud'st, when thou appliedst thy book with me,
What true affection bare we each to either,
How often walking in the fields together:
Have I in Latin given the names to thee,
Of this wild Flower, that Bent, this blossomed tree,
This speckled Fly, that Herb, this water rush.
This worm, or weed, the Bird on yonder bush?
How often when ye have been asked a play,
With voices viols have we passed the day,
Now entertaining those weak A set of 4 and 5 parts of the Authors re^dy for
the press.
aires of mine,
Anon the deep delicious Transalpine,
Another while with pencill or with pe^,
Have limnd or drawn our friends pourtaies^ and then
Commixing many colors into one,
Have imita^ed some carnation,
^trange field-found flower, or a rare seen fly,
^ curious land-schap or a clouded sky?
Then happily weary of all these would go,
Unto that A second volume of Emblemes, done into Latin verse with their
pictures.
Poem I have labourd so:
Thus past our leasu^eable hours away;
And ye did learn ^uen in the midst of play.
Upon Corax. Epigram 71.
OLd Corax putting on glassen eine,
Bids Trudge his man to reach this book of mine;
And by the fire in his w^eker chair,
(One foot upon the ^onges) me think I hear
Him cough, and say, this Author has some wit,
Pity he made no better use of it.
Upon Sir Acolastus. Epigram 72.
HOdge art awake, what shall we do to day,
To cards, go drink, or else go see a play?
Not I Goddammee, I was last night drunk,
Rogue hold ye this key, and from my truncke,
Go fetch me out my sa^^en su^e de Roy,
My Mistres bracelet, and de'yee hear me boy,
A light, a pipe, and some Tobacco up,
With ale, a to^t, a nut-meg, and a cup:
Let Patricke saddle chest-nut; and bid Meg,
Prouide's a dish of butter and an egg.
Thus like a mil-horse Acolastus treades
The self same circle, and this life he leade^,
Save when he hears perhaps the sermon bell,
He^ keeps his bed, and that day is not well.
Upon my self. Ep^gram 73.
Look how a City Tailor when he make^
A iouiall summer journey to his mind,
In every Town will call for ale and cake^,
His wife set smiling in her coach be^ind,
Rapt with deligh^ to see the pride of May,
The frisking lambe^, and green geese by the way.
So now this Spring my merry Muse and I,
Must walk the world abroad and take the ai^e,
Who at our work all Winter close did ly;
And our decayed spirits go repair.
Then Envy none our Mirth upon the way,
For once a year, Apolo laughe^ they say.
Upon Mildred. Epigram 74.
MIldred my Lady Too-goods chambermaid,
Has now her wage^ by her Master paid,
Not quarterly, but duly once a year,
And in a purse as big as she can bear.
Upon Mend-sh^^. Epigram 75.
MEnd-shoo did wa^e so deep to dig for roote^,
At last he ran himself quite over ^he boots.
Upon Sir Simon Harpax. Epigram 76.
SIr Harpax when a Benefice does fall,
Enqui^es about for him that will give most^
For meri^ mooues him not a whit at all,
But must without it empty kiss the post.
Yet if he feel some farmer gin ^o bite,
For's late commenced son, he tells him ^ha^,
His many years true service to requi^e,
He has bestowed the Grant upon his man;
Who to him goes, agrees and takes the gold,
To's Master use, when without more ado
Re^urning it, and by Sir Harpax ^old,
He pockets up pe^haps a piece or two:
Hence Harp^x swears, among his other shifts,
He none preferres but men of passing gif^s.
Upon Crab. Epigram 78.
CRab being caught, and in the Sergeants power,
For shame and anger looked both red and sower.
To Master John Brown of Sp^^kes in Tacolneston. Epigram 79.
I Told you, though you have the world at will
To happiness there somewhat wants still,
Which is not (as you have) to have a wife,
Tha^'s young and passing fair, to lead a life
Without disturb, to have a perfect health,
Abound in chargeles and vnpurchas'd wealth;
These are without one, and unto a mind,
Soule-sick, skil-poore, or with ambition blind,
Confere no more unto it is ease, say I,
Then do rich curtains and a Canopie,
With pearl and gold embroidered all about,
Unto my Lord who lies upon the gout:
Though much content her^ from a man may find,
Who can deny? the fo^ntaine is ^he mind,
Whence must the soft and silver stream arise,
To fence as well as feed our Paradise.
Then as ye would some ^oodly fabric r^^re,
Lay your foundation sure, the heavenly feare^
And pu^e religion, hereon let be pight,
Your lives strong frame that is ^onest and vprigh^,
Make ch^ise (a^ studdes) of ^rusty friends that will
Like heart of oak, not s^rinke for good or ill,
Not the rude rout who only friendship measure
As they get by you, and one does them pleasure.
Of friendship, these, the base subsistence be,
And surfe^ of all ingenuitie,
These are the pies that on your peare-tree ^op,
But build to ea^e the fruit in Autumn up,
Or these doubl^d throated lays, you find,
To ea^e your ^heries, leave the stones behind:
Or happily filled their bellies from the ^ree,
Beray the bow, and so away they fl^e.
I then advise you for to make your light,
Behind experience and a fore foresight,
Since none knows what may fall, close couerd lay
Up somewhat to withstand a rainy day.
Let arts, good parts, a conscience clear of sin,
Be your best pride and household stuff within,
Then lest the circle in your center rest,
And hold your self above a monarch blessed.
Upon my self. Epigram 80.
I think the Northmimmes in Hertfordshire near to Saint Albanes.
place that gave me first my birth,
The genius had of epigram and mirth,
There famous Moore did his V^opia wright,
And thence came Heywoods Epigrams to light,
And then this breath I drew, wherewith (our own)
These shaken leaves about the world are blown.
Upon Grantorto. Epigram. 81.
THe morrow after just, Saint Georges day.
Grantorto pi^^ous drunk, sa^e in a di^ch,
His hands by^s side, his gelding straid away,
His scarlet hose, and doublet very rich,
With mudde and mine all beastly raid, and by
His feather huge and broad brimm'd hat did ly.
We asked the reason of his sitting there,
Zounds cause I am King Solomon (quoth he)
And in my throne^ then for the love we bear,
Replied my self, unto your Majesty,
We Will pull you out, and henceforth wish your grace
Would speak your proverbs in a warmer place.
Upon D^^^^. Epigram 8^.
I Du^^^ asked as we at supper sat,
How long he had lived in the married sta^e,
Sir, just (quoth Du^mo) with my wife I met,
In the great plague time, I remember yet,
And ^ighing, as he would have burst in twain,
Said^ now almost the thirtieth of her reign.
To R.H. my iouiall host at Viroche. Epigram 83.
I Wish old Robin that we had thee here,
To lie a little with Sir Rossicleere,
He swears the Persian summers are so whot,
That while he drank the Sun did melt the pot:
Thou swear'st, in Russia that it freezeth so,
That men with sneezing, off their noses throw.
He says that one day in a skirmish hot,
On's rapier point he took the flying shot.
Thou toldst me how an Irishman was slain,
Shot through the brains, and after served again.
He vo'wd that man's flesh was his only meat
In Rome, and neither bread not salt could get^
And thou reportedst, how at Remingham,
A leaguet was, and thou therein the same,
Where the horse drank up so dry a running flood,
That some were choked with fishes in the mud.
He says the Morgor mused how England can,
As was himself afford so brave a man.
Thou in all towns throughout the Netherland,
Swearest thou have swords lie pressed at thy command.
Thus at the Tru^^ ye much at one do roame,
Save thou lie nearer, fa^^her he from home.
Upon Rinaldo and Reiner. Epigram 84.
RInaldo meeting Reiner in the street,
Deep in his debt, he thus does ^einer greet,
You know some money is betwixt us two,
That welny now these ten years has been due^
Quoth Reiner, looking down unto his f^ete,
IN faith and we will part it, if I see it,
But as I live Rinaldo I find none,
As feign as you, I would you had your own.
Upon Saburro. Epigram 85.
SAburro now has sold both house and lands,
Exceeding much upon his gentry stands,
Auer^ing how his Ancestrie and name,
From Normandi^ in with the conquest came.
Saburro should thy gentries plea stand good,
Then ^ag and rag might be of gentle blood.
Upon Milo. Epigram 86.
MIlo believes and has a wager laid,
The world will end within these fourteen year,
By whom or where the money shall be paid,
But if he winnes is Milo's only fear.
To my ingenious pupil, and most honest attorney Master John Cock, of
Deepham. Epigram 87.
IF Reason be the soul of law, I feign
In this point (pupil) would resolved be,
How is it that a statute does maintain,
That when the law defines the contrary,
Yet reason though far stronger, must give place;
And law against reason carry clear the case.
To my very friend Master Thomas Augush. Epigram 88.
With other friend^ I bid you to my feast,
Though coming last, yet are you not the least.
Upon Lodronio. Epigram 89.
LOdronio like a huge Westphaly swine,
Lies close and never stirs without his doore^,
Feeds of the best, drinks sack and claret wine,
And at command'ment has his lease of whores,
That death this hog would stick, the parrish pray,
For to his hand he is soundly singed they say.
Upon Rombo. Epigram 90.
ROmbo does banne, chase, deeply curse and swear,
And vows reneng'd o'th parish for to be,
For that his name's not in their Register,
Which he so foul a journey took to see,
(Not that he is to take up any lands;
And one and twenty, that lost labor were,
But of his last abode to bring some hands,
To save him from a burning through the ear)
That for it now he must be feign to look,
In Newgate or the Poultry Counter book.
Upon Rusco. Epigram 91.
RVsco to London having brought his son,
To bind him prentise, asked of the lad,
What trade best liked him, for he must take one,
And only stick to that he chosen had:
Then father, if unto an Alderman,
For seven years I were bound, I did not care,
So after I my time had served (quoth Io^n)
I might be sure for to be Lord Mayor.
Upon Augustus Caesar. Epigram 92.
AVgustus hearing how a Roman knight,
Whose goods could not pay half his debts, was dead,
Yet living slept at quiet ^uery night,
Sent to his house and needs would buy his bed,
Believing suit it had some virtue rare,
That in his case could keep a man from care.
Of a Spaniard and a Hollander. Epigram 93.
AN Hollander and a Spaniard one day met,
Within their Inn, and down to dinner set,
Each did begin his country to commend,
And rec^on up the riches it did lend.
What ^ay you (quoth the Spaniard) to our land,
Where (taking up an Orange in his hand)
These golden apples thrice a year do grow,
(...) fair as those Hesperides in show,
(...) they which nimble Atalanta staid,
(...) it which Paris gave the Cyprian maid?
(...) on a Holland cheese by, claps his hand;
And in the honor of his Belgic land,
Replies, And what can you to Holland say,
Of these that yields us thousands For in Holland as often as they milk they
make their ^^eeses, which is thrice a day:
thrice a day?
To Sir Ninian Ou^c^^^. Epigram 94^
AS Tarlion when his ^ead was only seen,
The Tire-house door and Tapistrie between,
Set all the mulltitude in such a laughter,
They could not hold for scarce an hour after,
So (Sir) I set y^^ (as I promised) ^orth,
That all the world may wonder at your worth.
Upon Albi^^s. Epigram 95.
ALbinus much the other day did blame,
Neates-foote his man for haunting common whoores,
And somewhere wished him get a wife ^or shame,
Or else next quarter get him out of doors.
A wife (quoth Neates-foote) never while I breath,
I got one lately, but within this mile,
When as I thought to die no other death,
For just her husband took us in the while.
Upon Methusus. Epigram 96.
MEt^usus asked me why I called him so^,
I answer made, because he loved the pot,
For while Met^usus busy i^ with it,
The fool I Am sure's as busy with his wit.
Impresa's. To Master William R^rd, the glory of our Nation for Music.
Epigram 97.
A Swan set dying, singing, and the word
In golden letters, Never such a bird.
To my La. M. Epigram 98.
A Scepter Lady, yours within your fist,
Your mo^ plain engli^h, I do what I li^^.
To Master Doctor D^^l^nd. Epigram 99.
YOur word, Hine ille lach^im^, beneath,
A Venice Lute within a laurel wreath.
To my true friend Master William Frost lately gone for Ireland. Epigram 100.
A Flock of Feld-fares, thine, upon the coast,
Taking their leaue^, and by them, Farewell Frost.
To honest Rafe. Epigram 101^
AN emblem, R^^e, thou did request of me,
A cudgel lying in an apple tree,
Be thine, and since, thou art in the Gaole^ I hear
Thy Po'sie, I am lodged for thi^ year.
Epigram 102^
WHy do Sir John, Sir H^ry, and Sir H^gh,
All winter long themselves like cucko^es hide,
Within good Towns, and seldom come in view,
Save every half year when their rent^ are paid?
I do imagine (though but my presumption)
They lie at Physic for the Purse consumption.
To the ingenious and excellent in Po^sie Master Thurstane Smith. Epigram 103.
MY noble Thurstane, I do marvel much,
How thy brave Muse did find her self employed
In Norwic^, spun she Iersey with the Dutch,
O^ lo^t she ought, and so there had it cried?
May be, she looked for ^omething in the wagon,
Or wished to make a speech before the dragon.
To my ever loved scholar Master H^^mond Claxton. Epigram 104.
I Prithy Ham^ond do thy labor spare,
To ask me what I lack, as I do pass
Your shop in Cheap, with sir, Here ^a^tens are,
Good three pil'd veluets, taffa^a^, gold lace:
But let me Hammond go in quiet by,
For thou know what I lack as well as I.
Upon Dorinda. Epigram 105.
THe fair Dorinda dressed c^p a pie
In state, resembles Cambridge Trinity,
Her, her all turret, and of wondrous cunning,
Her backside broad, and front full fair in show,
Only her teeth stand like old rotten Row.
Upon Sir Dolphin. Epigram 106.
SIr Dolphin can endure no disgrace,
And present death it is to give him the lie,
Yet is he drunk in every alehouse base,
In Tapsters, Whoores, and Tinkers company.
Upon Sir Gra^eles. Epigram 107.
WHile grim God-damm^e, at my Ladies table,
Chewing the cudde of vengeance still did fit;
And (lately bastinado'd) was not able,
For melancholy to digest a bi^,
But tearing heaven with fearful oaths did threate,
The flesh of that base slave must be his meat;
And would have said, A dagger he should bui^,
Mistaking swore, A beggar he would die.
A Lattin dis^ich which a Friar of Shertogen Bosch in Brabant wrote in my
Greek Testament, while I was busy p^rusing some books in their Library,
intituled^

Ad Angliam ve^tram. Epigram 108.
ANgelus indiderat, dicas, anne Anglia no^en,
Spirituum siquis Lucifer ille fuit.
Thus in English.

Say England, did an Angel christen thee?
If any, surely Lucifer wa^ he.
His back being turned, I left this behind me, in the first printed page of a
fair Arias Montanu^ bible, to require him.

Ad Syluam D^cis. Epigram 109.
DIcere. Sylua Ducis cur falso nomine, sylu^
Cum ca^^as, sterilis stagnet et om^is ager?
Fallor, an in d^^os arb^r mutatur adse^s,
In Monachum stipes qu^m stipe vulgus ali^.
Which is in English,

Why falselie art thou^ called the Dukes-wood, when
Thou have no woods, and all thy feildes are fenne?
Thy Trees (I ghe^se) are turned to sainted stocks,
And begging Friars have robbed thee of thy blocks.
Upon Ell^^ Epigram 110.
FRom Norwich e're since Ello had his wife,
He never led one minute quiet life,
For if but steps with friends to drink, he swears
She coming beats the po^s about his ears,
Or if the Hos^esse in his presence be,
Down go the windows, and ye rogue, says she,
Faith have I found your haunt, what close with her,
Directly home ye foul toad^bellied curre:
Have patience Ello, who knew ever yet,
B^t that a piece of No^wich stuff would fret?
Epigram 111.
I One thing Coriat like, when I was over,
Obs^ru'd in Andwarp, Arnhem, and Scon^ouer
Among the Du^ch, which was they write above,
Inn doors, the name (as every man did love)
Of several beeres within the house they have,
As R^^mers, Wesops Andwarps, and the ^ra^,
With Delfts, Breda's, Lubbs, Boga^'^, English, and
As many ^orts as Cities in the land.
Yet though the beer of sund^y natures be,
In their being drunk no difference did ^ see.
Upon Apodemon. Epigram 112.
GReat Apodemon surely much has seen,
Since in all l^nde^ he under heaven ha^h been;
And can of ^^tch as readily relate,
Their living laws, their bounds, their wealth and star^
As if in twice twelve hours he had gone,
With Sol the worlds bounds in procession.
Arabi^ much be praises for her smell^,
Persis ^o^ silks, her gemmes and pearly shells;
For poo^e and barren then he does condemn,
The land of Jury with Jerusalem,
Virginia, he likes not, cause their air is f^ggy,
Swede's rich in silver, Hungary in gold,
E^gland is temp' rate, Muscouie's too cold,
But since the pox some few days since he got,
He never ^els how Fran^e he found too hot^
Upon Saint Mary's Steeple. Epigram 113.
SAint Mary's steeple's up and ready soon,
But Paul's it is thought will lie abed till noone^
Upon Oenopolio. Epigram 114.
ERewh^le there was in Nigers stream (I read)
A Jewel found of price inualued.
For Nature this, one rude and massy stone,
Had cemented of every precious one,
To show her skill or make some finder, poor
For wealth, to equal the greatst Emperor.
The Diamo^d disdaining borrowed light,
Was here joined with the golden Chrysolite,,
The Iacyn^th mixed with the Sa^byre blew,
The Topaze Rubie with his fiery hew:
He^re Opals Emeralds of glassy green,
The Sardonyx with Nigers Pearls were seen:
I never saw this wonder, but suppose,
It much resembled Oenopolio's nose.
Upon Furno. Epigram 115.
FVrno (ith jail) commends the days of old,
And those same times, our Poets say, were gold,
His fate vpbraiding which did give him birth,
In this worst age of iron, when from earth,
A^trea's fled (his) valor wants regard,
Religion practice, learning her reward,
An iron age indeed that Furno fe^^es,
When iron hourly followe^ him at heeles^
Upon a Duch Boore, and his answer to Charles the fif^. Epigram 116.
THe famous Charles when having lost his way,
By Hessens Lan^graue Maurice hard pursued,
And all a winters rainy night did s^ray,
He knew not whither thorough thick^ts rude,
He saw a light, the dwelling of a Boo^e,
And thither rode and knocked at his door.
And calling to him kenneld in his bed,
In gentle wise did crave the time of night;
It Is all by three, in churlish wise he said;
The Emperor asking how he knew so right
Without a clock, Gots sacreloten, how
(Replied the Boore) ^^skellam, pi^^'d but ^ow.
Upon Theorbo. Epigram 117.
THeorbo both in earnest and in sport.
Must bear a part in every company;
And will be heard the loudest in consort,
(...) s^ldome mute or out of tune is he,
(...) ^hen he wants a case unto his back,
Or fe^res (at Tyborne) a base string to crack.
Upon Taurus. Epigram 118.
Is It true that Taurus late has lost his wit?
How can that be when never he had it?
I could believe it, had he fought a fray,
And so perhaps his fingers cut away.
Upon Sir Tristram. Epigram 129.
SEe ye Sir Tristram yonder on the stage,
With the huge feather and his snout-faire page,
A fearful neate^ tongue hanging by his side,
With a stilletta to his girdle tied,
The very same whom Druso's prentise met,
The other day and challenged for a d^bt
Some nine years owing; when Sir Tristra^ drew,
And in his fury at the prentise flew,
Who mildly craved a word within his ear,
(For shame, said he, it is to quarrel here)
And (...) ^^emselues they might but next day meet,
In Fi^soury, where he hit debt should quit
By valor, or be liable to it.
It was ag^eed, next morrow both gone out,
Met, drawn, and ready for to have about,
How long to fence, quoth Tristram, have thou gone,
S^^uen ye^res, quoth' prentise: twenty now and one,
My sword, said Tri^^ra^, have I practiced:
Th^n he^re me fellow, it may not be ^ayd,
I ever wronged thee (for by all the God^,
A gentleman ^ am, and scorn the odds,)
Go four^te^ne years yet longer to thy fenc^,
I Will meet thee here ag^ine two seven years ^^nc^^
On equal terms, and then God-damme^ ^ight,
And by this hand-la do thee any right.
Epigram 120.
SArtor at Leyde^ has commenced, they say,
And come a leaden Doctor thence away.
To my very worthy and honest ^riend Master Robert Constable of Hingham, high
Constable of the hundred of Foreh^w. Epigram 121.
As precious wares we see are often wrapped
In paper^ small, so farc^ it with me now,
Who in these leaves my deares^ love have lapt
And sent it as a token unto you,
Who of a Constable deseru^ to be,
A Justice for your brain^ and honesty.
Epigram 122.
GReat Bomb^s heir, whose golden suite and face^
Show like a Citterne in ^ gilded case,
(...)

^^igr^^ 127.
NO dull conceit, no left th^t'^ p^^^e (...)
No halting feet, or te^mes that be obs^^^^
^ome neer^ my vers^^ those graces I resign^,
^o Cherilus and foul mouthed Areti^e:
For as my mind is merry, honest, fre^
I't^ image, so my vein and verse^ be^.
FINIS.
