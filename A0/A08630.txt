THE Heroycall Epistles of the Learned Poet Publius Ouidius Naso, Jn English
Verse: set out and translated by George Turberuile Gent. with Aulus Sabinus
Aunsweres to certain of the same.

Anno Domini 1567.

IMPRINTED AT London, by Henry Denham.

To the Right Honorable and his Singul^ good Lord, Lord Tho. Hovv^rde Vicount
Byndon. etc. George Turberuile wishes Nestors years, increase of Honor, with
preservation of desired health.
RJGHT NOble, indebted to your Honor for a number of undeserved friendships,
and unable altogether to requite the least of a thousand courtesies: sought
the means how to acquit me of some part thereof. But waying mine own
defaulte, and considering your Honors merits, wox almost in utter despair:
until at length it repairde to my thought, that it was no greater token of
Honor, liberallye to bestow upon other great rewards, than a proof of
Nobility gratefullye to accept at others hands slender gifts according to
their hability that offered the same. Artaxerxes his good acceptaunce of a
handefull of running water, bred me to this boldness to offer your Honor a
handful of written Papers: hoping that as be thought no disdain of the one, so
you will not take scorn of the other. Let me crave this one thing at your
Honors hands, that the baseness of this my translation of the learned Poet
Ovid, procure not you to refuse the Patronage and defense of my slender Muse.
Which as J know undoubtedly shall never cou^teruaile your courtesies: So do J
assuredlye hope may be a proof of my good will and not forgotten duty. The
very name, Heroycal (for so are the Epistles termed) deserved an Honorable and
Heroycall Personage to be their guard. Which if your honor refuse not (as I
know you will not refuse) waying the giuers intent, and seeing that these are
the first fruits of his travail) you shall not only purchase immortal praise
of others: but I be encouraged and animated to greater and grauer attempts:
which I shall no sooner atchiue, but you shall be a witness of my endeavors,
and ara^pier to my exploytes. Thus having boldly importuned your assistance,
and tediously molested your ears with circumstances, leaving now at length to
abuse your friendly patience, J end: wishing to your Honor increase of
Nobility, with a most happy life: and after the Catastrophe of this worldly
Comedy, (wherein you play a statelye part) the gladsome joys of the
everlasting Seignorie.

Your humble Orator G. Turberuile.

The Translator to his Muse.
GO (^lender Muse) and make report to men
That mere desire to pleasure them in deed
Made me in hand to take the painful pen:
Which if I may, I have my hoped meede.
I neither gape for gain nor greedy fee,
My Muse and I have done, if men in gree
will take this trifling toye.
To the Reader.
LEARNED, Courteous; and Gentle Reader, I had long ere this time bid thee to a
slender banquet: Had it not been that other by their good wills had prevented
my gentle offer and good meaning therein. But I saw so many rich and stately
bourdes covered, so many curious carpets laid, such dainty delicates deuisde,
such courtly cates and conficts daily brought in, as loath I was upon such
iunkets and fine fare to procure the to a rude rear supper. But considering
that mine ability is not to make any better or more sumptuous: and waying
that of duty and good will I ought to manifest my well meaning with the reast:
I have here at length bid thee (I say) to a base banquet, to sharpen thy
stomach, and procure thy appetite to fyner fare. Hoping that thou will not
scorn or loathe any dishe that shall be set before thee. If it be so that thou
my slike any thing, impute the blame to the cook. For doutlesse the Cates of
themselves in their kind, are passing curious, but for want of cunning in
dressing the same, may appear nothing delectable to the eye, nor toothsome to
the taste. The feast was devised long agone by Ovid at Rome, and passing well
liked in learned Italy: no less for diversity of disshes, than copy of
confictes. May be that if thou show thy self friendly in well accepting this
provision, thou shall be invited to a better banquet in time at my hands, who
as soon as occasion will serve, will give thee to understand of my good will.
Mean while play a friendfull guestes part, and mislike not any thing that
shall be served thee, without just cause. Challenge not unto thee an ouercurious
mouth and taste. Thus loath any longer to withholde thee from thy vitailes, I
wish thee to feed and farewell.

George Turberuile.

The Argument of the first Epistle, entitled Penelope to Ulysses.
THe angry Greeks for Helens rape preparde
To Troie: when wise Ulysses marryde late
A fury fainde, in hope to have been sparde:
But Palamede lothing to lose a Mate
So needful as Ulysses was, bewrayde
The fraud of him that gladly would have stayde.
A way he goes. When ten years war was spent;
And flaunting Troie trodden to the ground:
With other Greeks to ship Ulysses went;
But Pallas then the wrathful Goddess fround,
And made the Grecians greedy of their home,
Full ten years space on surging Seas to rome.
Which absence long Penelope aggrieude,
That little space her husband had enioyde:
(For saken wight) she verily belieude
Some other Less Ulysses had acoyde.
And this procurde the loving wife to wright,
That she his cause of absence learn might.
The first Epistle. Penelope to Ulysses.
TO thee that lingrest all too long,
thy Wife (Ulysses) sendes:
Gain write not, but by quick return
for absence make amends.
To Greekish Nymphs that hateful Troy
is now to ruin brought:
Scarce might the King and all his wealth
requite the wrong they wrought.
O that the surging Seas had drencht
that lustful Lecher tho:
When he to Lacedemon came
imbarckt, and wrought our woe.
Then should I not have laid my limbs
in desert coutch alone:
Ne made complaynt that Phoebus steades
too slow to glade had gone.
Then should no Beldames distaffe made,
my Wydowish hand so faint:
Whilst I to waste the weary night,
with spinning was artaynt.
When stood I not in worser awe
in deed than was befell?
Aye love is passing full of fear,
though every thing be well.
Me thought I saw a swarming troop
of Trojans thee about:
No sooner Hectors name I heard,
but Hector made me doubt.
If brute had blazed Amphymachus
of Hector to been slain:
Amphymachus by such report
procurde my dread again.
Or when Menetius son was said
in forged arms to die:
I sorrowde that the Trojans did
Patroclus craft epsy.
When Tlepolemus lost by force
of Lycian lance his life:
By Tlepolemus death were made
my slacked sorrows rife.
In fine what so they were of Greece,
that did amid their foes,
A fear within my breast more cold
than Mountain yse arose.
But righteous God that Hymen hight,
and true love has in care:
Has kept Ulysses free from scath,
and Trojans caught in snare.
The Greekish Chieftaines are returnde,
the sacred Altars flame:
Of barbarous spoil the Gods have part,
that well deserude the same.
The Matrones for their salued Feeres
most grateful gifts prepare:
And they, how Troie by their toil
achieved was declare.
The sage with silver hairs do muse,
and dainty Damsels eake:
The wives about their husbands hang
when they begin to speak.
And lo when Tables once are laid,
one ginneth straight to show
The wreakefull war, and draws with Wine
the Trojan Tents arowe.
Here Symois (says he) did flow,
here is Sigeian land:
And here the aged Priams Hawle
and Princely house did stand.
There fierce Achylles pight his Tents,
there wise Ulysses lay:
Here Hector rent in doleful wise,
the horses did affray.
Thus ancient Nestor made report,
who told thy son the same:
And he (as was his part to do)
declarde it to his Dame.
How Rhesus thou did make to rue,
and Dolon yield to death:
The One sheeping, the other by thy guile
did lose his vital breath.
And did thou dare (thou retchlesse man
and ouerbolded wight)
To Thracian Tents to shape thy course
in ugly shade of night?
And only by the aid of one,
so many men to slaye
That woonted were to be so ware
and mind thy wedlock aye?
With quaking fear my heart was cold,
and visage passing pale:
When thou did pass along the Host,
and Thracian horses stale.
But what to me (unhappy Feme)
auailes the Trojan wrack:
And walls which you by breach have brought,
to utter spoil and sack:
If I in Wydowes state remain,
as I tofore have done:
And must for aye Ulysses lack,
as when the broyle begone?
To me that Troie sole does stand
though Soldiers had the spoil:
And they that Victors were with plough
for lucre turn the soil.
Where stately buildings were to see,
and Trojan town did stand:
There sprouteth corn, with Phrygian blood
so fatted is the land.
Half buried bones of warlike wightes
the crooked Culters tear:
Both grass and grain with herbs do grow,
where haughty houses were.
Thou Victor ever art alack,
ne once wilt make me show
By loving lines, or message means,
what cause of stay does grow.
No stranger stumbles on our stronde,
or bringes his Barck to bay,
But I enquire him of thy health
or ere he pass away.
And so his fortune favor, that
on thee he chance to light,
I pray him yield those loving lines,
which I to thee endight.
I sent to Pylos to inquire,
(where aged Nestor dwelt)
No certain rumor of a truth
from Pylos have I felt.
From thence I sparde not for expense
to Sparta me to hie:
But Sparta can not make accoumpt,
where thou do live or die.
More better were for me (in faith)
if Troie stood again,
(But I unconstant wight am wroth
with these my wishes vain.)
Then should I certain be and sure
where thou did lead thy life:
Then only should I dread the wars,
and storms of styrred strife.
Then should my drearie doleful plaint
conjoined be with mo:
That in the absence of their Makes
should take some taste of woe.
I fraughted am with fear, but what
I dread I know not well:
My cares increase, the way is wide
that leads me to this hell.
No peril on the tossing Sea,
or on the land is seen,
But I surmise that they forthwith
thy cause of stay have been.
Whilst fondly thus amazde I stand,
(such is thy pleasures plight)
Thou may bestow thy love a fresh
upon some other wight.
To whom thou makste a show perhaps,
how homely is thy wife:
And how at Distaffe she delights
to lead a Rusticks life.
But (Gods) O let me be beguilde,
let whisking winds transport
Such thoughts, and thou that may retire,
dislodge not in such sort.
Icarius my grutching Sire
would force me break my Heast,
And blaming this thy flack return,
would make new marrige feast.
But as I am, I will be thine
let rancor feed his fill,
Penelope will be the wife
of her Ulysses still.
Yet naythelesse my endless suit
at length has mooude my Sire:
Who rules his rage with reasons brake,
and Masters wrathful ire.
From Islands round about do flock
of suitors many one:
Zacinthus, Samus, with the reast,
by suit increase my moan.
Those roysting rufflers bear the sway
within thy Palace gate:
With catching claws they waste thy wealth,
and seek t'impayre thy state.
Pyzander, Medon, Polybus,
Eurimachus yfere:
With Antynous it is no need,
for to recite as here.
What should I these, with others name,
who seek to spend thy good:
Which thou by manly Mart have got
in danger of thy blood?
The rascal eke do rule the roast,
Melanthius, and Ire,
(Which soundes to thy disworship most)
together do conspire.
We are by tale, but three, God wot,
thy weak and wretched wife:
Telemachus thy little son,
Laertes lothing life.
Thy Son not long ago was like
by craft to been consumde:
Whilst he, to pass against their wills
to Pylos had presumde.
But Gods I grate this only boon,
that he by course of kind,
His fathers eyes and mine may close,
and live himself behind.
This is the crooked Nurces work
and clownish Cowardes care:
And he that dailye serves the swine,
a like is wont to fare.
Laertes ouerlode with years,
unable to the war,
Amidde these states can strike no stroke
when they begin to jar.
Thy Sanne (so Gods dee lend him life)
to man's estate will grow:
But thou, in these his childish years,
should guard him from the foe.
I Miser wight am not of force
to banishe them the place:
Wherefore see thou who art our aid,
that thou return apace.
Thou bast (long may thou have) a Son,
that in his tender age,
Should follow on his fathers steps,
and life for worship gage.
Live not aye retchlesse of thy Sire,
whose eyes thou oughtst to shut:
His dying date draws on apace,
the twine of life is cut.
And I that at thy parture was,
a Gyrle to behold:
Of truth am waxt a Matrone now,
thy self wilt judge me old.
The Argument of the second Epistle, entitled Phyllis to Demophoon.
DEmophoon minding after Trojan broyle
To long desired Country to retowre:
For all his force, for all his painful toil,
Was brought to Thrace by mean of stormy shower,
Where Phyllis raignde, who likte her guest so well,
As first to boorde, and then to bed they fell.
Within a while Demophoon began to feign
And forge excuse to Athens to repair,
With gaged faith to shape return again
Within one Month, and bid her not despair:
But when the fixed time was gone and past,
Thus Phyllis wrote unto her guest at last.
The second Epistle. Phyllis to Demophoon.
I That thine Hostess, Phyllis was,
a Rhodopeian Maid:
Mislike that thou my guest, beyond
thy fixed time have stayde.
Thy plighted promise was with ship
here to arryude again
Before or near about the time
the waxen Moon should waine.
But Phoebe fourthly has repayrde
her wasted horns a new:
Yet may I not on Thracian coast
take once of thee a vewe.
Though thou accoumpt the fleeting time,
(which Lovers note by trade)
Thou shall not find that Phyllis has
too soon her plaint ymade.
And long enough I fed on hope,
for such is Lovers guise:
We hardly credit hurtefull happes
till damage do arise.
I have often flattred with my self,
and thought the Southren wind
Had stuffed thy sails, and brought thy Barck,
which yet I can not find.
I have accursed Theseus often,
that was thy cause of stay:
And yet may be that he at all
bred not this long delay.
Another while I stood in awe,
least thou to Haebrus Lake
Directing course, in middle Seas
by wrack thy bane had take.
Full often have I for thy health
in mild and humble wise,
With Incense made request to Gods,
that lodge in lofty skies.
And sundry times when Aeole had
his broyling impes inclosde:
That if thou were alive, thou would
have commen, I supposde.
Thus loyal love (what so might breed
and be a cause of stay
To such as travel) did devise,
excusing thy delay.
But thou not forcing on thy faith,
ne counting of thy Hest,
Not dreading Gods to witness callde,
do mind thy Phyllis lest.
Demophoon to the winds ingagde
his promise with his sail:
I sorrow that the ones return,
and the others faith does fail.
Denounce to me what I have done,
but looude thee all too well?
By mine offense I have deserude
that thou with me should dwell.
In me one heinous fault is found
that harbourde such a guest:
But this my guilt has force of boon,
and merit there does rest.
Where now thy solemn sacred oaths,
thy plighted troth with hand?
And Gods appealde as true records
to witness of thy band?
Where is that holy Hymen now,
that us as chosen Fears
By free assent conioynde in one
yfeare to wast our years?
First sworst thou by that ghastly Goulfe,
where wind and wave do rore:
By whom thou were in point to pass,
as often thou had before.
Then Neptune was to witness callde,
thy Graunde and worthy Sire,
(Unless thou feign) who quails the Surge,
and swelling waters ire.
Then Venus, with her winged wight,
(that bred me all this teene)
Was sommond, whose revenger tools
are bow and arrows keen.
Dame Juno, that has spousall charge
and wedlock, shewde her face:
And Ceres with her solemn rytes,
was cyted to the place.
If each of these forenamed powers
and witnest thus in vain,
Should seek on thee to wreake their wrath,
could thou endure the pain?
My self (least thou should want at need
a Barck to leave my land)
Infonded, did repair the ships
that ragged lay on sand.
I trimde up all thy broken Oars,
whereby thou mightste depart:
And thus my self have forgde the tools,
that thyrled have my heart.
Thy many smooth and filed words
did purchase credites place:
I did believe thy stock, thy Gods
stood all in Phyllis grace.
I thought thy tears had been of troth:
can they be forged to?
Thy tears which at commaundment are,
from flattering face to flo.
Thy Gods did make me judge the best,
these pledges were in vain:
God wot one parcel of them might
a siely Maiden train.
That I supported thee at need
it mooues me naught at all:
So that thy harbor all had been,
the matter had been small.
But shameless and with blind forecast,
from bourde to bed to go:
And there to pass in Venus toys
does agrauate my woe.
O that the last forepassed night
before that cursed tide
Had been my last: then Phyllis might
with spotless faith have did
I hoped better, by deserte
who had thy friendship won:
The hope, which meede and right procures,
they say is well begoonne.
The glory is not great by guile
to circumuent a Maid:
You rather should my simpleness
with friendly favor paid.
A woman, and a loving wight
thy forged fraud has made
To be intrapt: God grant thy praise
by Phyllis spoil to vade.
Among the Athenian noble wightes
thy seat shall be assignde:
Thy Sire amid his spoils shall stand,
and thou his son behind.
When shameful Syron shall be read
and fell Procustes death,
And Scynis with the Minotaure,
whom Theseus reft his breath:
When Creon conquerde shall appear,
and Centaures there be seen:
And be recorded that thy Sire,
at Plutos Court has been:
Beneath thy Fathers manly factes,
shall stand this stately style:
(Lo this is that unfaithful guest,
who Phyllis did beguile.)
Of all thy fathers noble acts,
and worthy feats of fame:
Thou only doste resemble one,
which he accoumpts a shame:
For he king Minos daughter reft,
and her forewent at last:
And thou (as heir of all his guile)
doste frame a iugling cast.
But she has made a wise exchange,
(I spite not) for the best:
Upon her Tigers bridled brave,
she rydes at quiet rest.
But now such suitors as in Thrace,
of me were scornde before,
Despise to be espousde to her
who loves a stranger more,
Than such as were my Country men,
to Athens let her go,
(Say they) to wear the Thracian crown
we want not one I trow.
The end is it that tryes the fact,
God send him sorry haps,
That always thinks it best to judge
the cause by after claps.
But so my Country waves were cut,
and sundred with the keale,
Then might I vaunt my love imployde,
to tend to public weal.
But slender was the love I bare
to this my native soil:
My Palace moves not thee a mite,
ne Bystons pleasant goyle.
The countnaunce and the gesture both,
are yet imprinted fast
Within my breast, that thou did use,
when Phyllis saw thee last.
And did thou dare with clasping arms,
embrace her carcass so?
And touch her chirrie lyppe with thine,
a thousand times and ino?
And to confound thy brackish tears,
with Phyllis salted brine?
And that the weather serude so well,
a fault with Aeole fine?
And when thou tookste thy last farewell,
adue how darste thou say?
Demophoon will retire again,
that (Phyllis) is no nay.
Shall I expect his gainecome that
has mind on nothing less?
Or gape for sails that shonne the port
where was their chief redress?
And yet I can but long to see
thy coming, though be long:
Though fixed day be past, reuert
and quite somepart of wrong.
But what do I unhappy wish?
an other dainty dame
Both thee, and all thy love has won
to thy reprochefull shame.
I think that Phyllis is forgot,
that used her guest so well:
Fie, fie, of Phyllis make not strange,
ne ask the place I dwell.
I am that Phyllis (would thou wist)
who harbourde thee at need:
And gave thee port that long on Seas
had wandered all in dreede.
Whose goods inricht thy poor estate,
and having wealth at will
Did succor thee, and would have done
if thou had tarried still.
Even she, that made thee Lord and Prince
of all Lycurgus land:
And yielded thee a Scepter far
unfit for woman's hand.
As far as chillie Rhodope
to busshie Haemus goes:
And sacred Haebrus with his streams,
and weltring waters floes.
Even she that gave thee leave to pluck
her Maydenhead all beshroude:
And with thy crafty hand to let
her honest belt abroad.
At that synister time was pressed
Tisiphone in place:
And eke the Owl, with doleful shriche,
and monstrous ugly face.
Not far from thence with snakie bushe,
the fell Alecto lay:
Who with her ghastly glowing eyes,
the presence did affray.
Yet naythelesse to ragged rocks,
and shore I vie to hie:
And all about to kenne the coast
I cast my gazing eye.
When stars in rolling skies do ratinge,
or Phoebus yield his light,
I go to see where Aeols winds
with Neptunes waves do fight.
And whatsoever ship I vewe
come cutting on the Sea
To Thracia ward: I judge it straight
our native Gods to be.
Then like a Bedlam wight to waves
and drenching seas I run:
As far as swelling waters flow,
when ebbing tide is done.
But how much more the Bark ariues,
and nearer is to land:
The more amazde, and from my wits
estraunged do I stand.
Then gyn my senses all to fail,
my lively parts to faint:
And (were not for my Maids) I should
with swouning be attaint.
A creek there stands, that is by kind,
not far unlike a bow:
Whose picked points with ruthlesse rock,
and hardoned stone does grow.
I was resolude with stayed mind,
and unappalled heart,
From thence to cast my corpse adowne,
and will if thou depart.
Then restless floude, and fleeting waves,
my carcass will apply
To shore, and thou thine Hostess shall
vnterred see with eye.
Though Adamant thy rygor then
and stubburne steel exceed,
Yet will thou say, fie Phyllis, fie,
this pursuit had no need.
Sometime my fancy serves me well
with venoms drench to die:
And straight with sword to have my death,
I am at point to try.
Then with a string to stop my breath,
I think it passing fit:
And with a ruthlesse hand, a cord
about my throat to knit.
For certain fully bent I am,
with speedy leaning life,
To recompense my spotted fame,
in choice shall be no strife.
And thou that did procure my bane,
for thy desert shall have
This Verse, or some such other like,
insculped on my grave.
Demophoon, that guilefull guest,
made Phyllis stop her breath:
His was the cause, and hirs the hand
that brought her to the death.
The Argument of the third Epistle, entitled Briseis to Achylles.
THe Greeks ariude at Phrygia, fell to sack
The neighbor towns to aged Priams walls:
When fierce Achylles brought to wailefull wrack
Cilisias both, and took two Virgins thrawles:
The One Chrysis hight a passing goodly Dame,
And Briseis the other not much unlike the same.
Chrysis Atrides chose to sport withal,
Achylles Briseis had for like intent,
But when at last the Prince forewent his thrall,
He Briseis reft, whom erst Achylles hent:
Which done, he left his Lance, he fled the field,
And would no more his wonted weapons wielde.
The Chieftaine saw at length Achylles lack,
And former fight in field with furious so,
To stint the strife, he sent him Briseis back,
But he refusde to take the Lady tho:
Which when the Virgin saw, this following verse
Fair Briseis sent his brazen breast to pierce.
The third Epistle. Briseis to Achylles.
THe doleful lines you read
from captive Briseis came:
Whose Trojan fist can scarcely yet
with Greekish figures frame.
My flushing tears did cause
the blottes and blurres you see:
Yet in these dreerie drops I know
the weight of words to be.
If lawful be to plain
of thee my Lord and Feere:
Of thee my Feere and Lord the plaint
thy self shall quickly hear.
I deem it not thy guilt,
that I fro thee was sent:
Yet in some part for yielding me
so soon thou may be shent.
No sooner Eurybate
with Talthybius came:
But I was yielded to their hands
my journey forth to frame.
And they with glaunsing eyes
ytossed too and fro,
In secret silence did consult
my fancies plight to know.
I might have stayde a while,
deferring of my woe
Had earned thanks, I did not kiss
my Lord Achylles tho.
But tears beraynde my cheeks,
I retchlesse rent mine hear:
And least I had been rapte again,
I stood in ghastly fear.
Often minded I by breach,
and fcape to have retournde:
But scoutes and warders lay in wait,
that me my purpose wornde.
To issue out by night
of foes I stood in dread:
Though if I had been caught, I should
to Trojan Dames been lead.
But yielded up, I have
been many nights alack:
Not rescude by thy haughty power,
thy malice is too stack.
Patroclus did enquire,
(when I from thee did go:)
What bred my dole, since quick retire,
should soon abridge my woe?
Thou doste not only cease
to sue for me again:
But aye procurste the most thou may,
the Captain should detain
Thy Briseis from thy clummes:
go now I say and boast
(Thou hot and earnest lover) of
thy love in every coast.
To thee Amyntors son,
and Ajax came yfeare:
Thy fellow Phoenis, Ajax was
by blood to Achyl near.
Ulysses was the third,
which should have brought me back:
Of gentle words and guerdons great,
thou should have found no lack.
Atrides Tables sent
twice ten of glowing Brass:
So finely wrought as to behold
their matches rare it was.
Seven stools of semblant Art
and weight, with Talants five
Of Gold, a dosen stately steades,
to gallop passing bliue.
And (more than needed too,
or that Achylles lackt)
A troop of dainty trulles that came
from Cities lately sacked.
With them a pretty peate,
(of Agamemnons three
Fair daughters, but thou needed none)
thy loving wife to be.
Of like the sum is small
Achylles would bestow
Upon my ransom, if he scorn,
the things he should forgo:
That having proffer made
of me with heaped gain,
Refuses me and all the wealth,
and bars me by and maine.
Aye me, by what desert
has Briseis lost thy love?
Achylles, why so soon from her
should thou thy heart remove?
Does cankred fortune still
persist in yrefull rage
To Myser wightes? will never calm
these hurling broils assuage?
I by thy manly Mart
saw Lyrnes brought to sack:
And I in Lyrnes had a share,
which now is gone to wrack.
I saw with ruthful eye,
of mine alliance three,
(Of three my Mother dear was one)
there lyked lives to flee.
I saw my husband eke
on bloody soil, with gore
Besprent, with wide and gaping wounds
in vglye wise to rore.
For all these hurtes endurde
on thee I made my choice:
That thou my Lord and Lover art,
and brother I rejoice.
Thou sworste by Tethys tho,
that I should escape annoy:
And that my bondage should not breed
my damage, but my joy.
Even to this fine it tendes
that I with all this dowre,
Should of Achylles be refusde
for Agamemnons power.
Moreover brute has blazed,
that when the morning light
Has clearde the pole, that thou on Seas
with ship wilt take thy flight.
Which fell report no sooner
came unto mine care,
But I by sudden change of hue
declarde my change of cheer.
And will thou thus depart?
to whom will thou me leave?
Who will relieve my vile estate,
or succourlesse receive?
Let ghastly gaping gulf
and quaking earth devour:
Or let me feel of Vulcanes boltes
the stroke, and scathfull scour.
Let flasshing flame of fire
and lightning Briseis burn,
And so by sudden clappe her corpse
to partched cynders turn:
Ere she from Pthia see
her Lord Achylles wend
Imbarckt, and leave his thrall behind,
which mighty Jove forefende.
If my return may like,
or country Gods thee please:
My burden shall not breed the Barcke,
or thee such great disease.
The Victor as a thrall,
(not as a spouse her Make)
I will attend: my hand to spinne
and card shall undertake.
In all the Achaian soil,
to wife the brauest Dame
Receive, let her with Achyl lodge
Cupidos feats to frame.
A worthy daughter law
for Pelius, Aeacus son:
To whom, old Nereus to become
a Seignour would not shonne.
The while, I sielie wenche
prompt to obey thy hest,
Will do my task at turn and Cards
or Distaffe with the rest.
So that I crave her naught,
but only that thy wife,
(Which would torment my heart full sore)
will cease from grutching strife.
Ne banishe me mine ease,
ne suffer her to tear
In spiteful wise, my golden locks,
and rent my crysped hear.
In silence to thy self
say: this was once my love,
As the other is my wedded spouse,
whose rygor I reprove.
I force not what I bide,
so I with thee may stay:
But Briseis has a doubtful dreede,
that puttes good hope away.
What do thou more expect?
Atrides wrath is gone:
And Greece, in doleful wise, before
thy feet does make her moan.
Repress thy raging ire,
that do the rest subdue:
Now cruel Hector makes the Greeks
their restless rage to rue.
Achylles take thy love
and Briseis once again:
And then with luckie Mart, thy fist
with Trojan blood distaine.
Let her that was the cause
of wrath, appease thine ire:
Let her, that forced thy grief, be cause
that thou to joy aspire.
Ne do thou think disdain
to grant me my request:
Since Meleager yielded him
to Cleopatras hest.
I speak it by report,
thou knowste the matter well:
How Althaea sought to spoil her son,
(O Achyl) thou can tell.
Who was a valiant wight,
and noble for his Mart:
And yet he did renounce his arms,
and from his Country start.
Whom only mild request
of Cleopatra bowde:
But Briseis words are of no weight,
her suit is not alowde.
Whereof I ne disdain,
who may not justly crave
The title of a spouse, but am
a vile and bounden slave.
For sundry times when thou
were bent to Venus play,
Then would thou bid unto thy bed
thy servant come her way.
Among thy captives one
a Madams name me gave,
Those are unsitting terms (quoth I)
not greeing to a slave.
By my good husbands bones
laid in untimely pit,
(Which bones I mind to honor aye
till lively twine unknit)
And by my brothers gostes
which did resist till death,
And in defense of native Gods
to lavish were of breath:
By both our heads which we
have often led yfeare:
And by thy weapons, which my friends
have tryde to much, I swear.
That none of all the Greeks
my secret parts do know:
Forsake and as an abject scorn
me, if it prove not so.
But if I should demand
an oath of thee again,
That thou had with none other Less
but with thy Briseis lain.
And say: thou valiant wight,
have thou not past in play
Since I to Agamemnon went?
Achylles would say nay.
The Greeks surmise that thou
doste lead thy life in woe,
And mourn for want of Briseis: but
I see it is not so.
Thou rumblest on thy Lute,
sweet music lykes thine ear,
Some lustful Less will not permit
Achylles coutch be leare.
If question were, why thou
did stynt from wonted fight:
Thou would avouch that Venus were
with greater pleasure freight.
More safety is to lincke,
and row in Venus Barge,
Or with a pleasant Thracian Lute
all sorrows to discharge:
Than in thy hand to have
a shield with bloody spear,
Or heavy Helmet on thy head,
and feltred locks to bear.
But worthy works of war
were more embraced erst,
Than such a safety, when thy breast
with glories Lance was pearst.
What? were thou only stout
when I by fight was won?
Is all that courage quayled quite
now Lyrnes siege is done?
Nay, Gods forbid that thou
should seek thy fame to loose:
Yet rather let thy Lance the breast
of haughty Hector broose.
Send me (you Greeks) to treat,
as servant will I sue
Unto my Lord, and all my words
my kisses shall ensue.
For Briseis will prevail
far more than Phoenis can
And more than wise Ulysses tals
or Ajax with the man.
It Is much with folded arms
his neck to have imbrast:
And loving looks by fancy forced
with glauncing eye to cast.
Though thou (Achylles) be
with rigor and with rage
Repleate, yet naythelesse with tears
thy wrath I will assuage.
And may they now take place?
if so, Gods grant thy Sire
(The worthy Peleus) to his years
and hoped age aspire.
If so thou hear my suit,
Gods grant that Pyrrhus may
(Thy worthy son) to battle go
in good and luckie day.
Behold thou manly wight.
thy Briseis clad with woe:
Abandon rygor in good time
that pains thy Lover so.
Or if thy love be chaungde,
from love to loathsome hate:
Force her that lives in heavy plight
to yield her due to fate.
The fine will prove it so,
my corpse and color fade:
The soul to keep his former force
thy only hope has made.
Which hope, when so shall faint
and be debarde his hyre:
Thy Briseis to her husbands soul
and brothers shall aspyre.
To force a woman die,
no glory may thou gain:
But so thou long to have my death
let me with sword be slain.
Some blood as yet remaynes
in careful corpse inclosde,
Which would flush out, if with thy sword
the vain were once disclosde.
With self same weapon pierce
my weak and feeble side,
Wherewith (if Pallas had not been)
Atrides should have did.
Yet rather save my life
as thou to fore have done:
And thou that were by pity moonde,
by humble suit be won.
On Trojan wreake thy wrath,
thy fierce unfeigned foe:
Go has in Phrygian blood, thy blows
on Priams friends bestow.
Achylles say the word,
and where thou come or stay,
If thou will have me make return,
thy Briseis commes her way.
The Argument of the fourth Epistle, entitled Phaedrato Hippolytus.
THe frantic Phaedra, Theseus wedded Make,
In absence of the Duke her husband fell
In love with Hippolyte, and did forsake
The worthy wight that looude his wife so well.
But he delighted with Diana more
Than crancking Cupid, or Dame Venus play:
Aye kept the chase, and slew the savage Bore,
Not forcing what his Motherlaw did say.
She naythelesse attacht with glowing gleede,
To win the chastfull youth to filthy lust:
In subtle sort his humors sought to feed,
Persuading him her suit to be but just.
With sundry sleightes she went about to win
The retchlesse youth, that minded nothing less
Than shameful lust and filthy fleshly sin.
The Mothers mind this Pistle does express,
These suing lines her sluttish suit bewray,
Wherein to Hippolyte thus began she say.
The fourth Epistle. Phaedra to Hippolytus.
THe health and greeting that she sendes,
the same shall Phaedra want,
Unless thou (Hippolyte) such health
vouchsafe to Phaedra grant.
Receive and read what so is sent,
what damage may ensue?
In these perhaps there lurckes that may
thy pleasures plight renew.
As well by land, as surging seas,
such writtes are wont to wend:
And foes that feed on rancour, read
the lines the foes do send.
Thrice was I bent to have disclosde
to thee my covert suit:
But thrice my foltring tongue was tide,
I stood as one were mute.
I mingled bashful shame with love,
till love furpassed shame:
Wherefore the words I blushed to speak,
in writing read the same.
For what so Cupid gives in charge
it is madness to despise:
For he does conquer God and man
as nature did devise.
He when I stood in gastfull dread
to pen my earnest suit,
Said, write on Phaedra, he shall yield
and pay thy pains with fruit.
Be pressed thou mighty Prince of love,
and as thy fervent fire
Does burn my breast: so cause him fry
with Phaedras hot desire.
I mind not by enormous guilt
to break my spousall knot:
For (would thou wist) my life as yet
is free from shameful blot.
How much the longer it is ere love
inuades a woman's breast:
The sorer is the cruel gashe,
and breeds the more disrest.
My inward parts are all inflamde,
my bowels boil with heat:
My scorched heart forepinde with woe
a lurcking wound does freate.
As Bullocks may not well abide
the crooked yoke at furst:
Nor trampling Colts with bit or brake
to have their jaws yburst:
So fares it by my skillesse breast
that hardly may endure.
Unwonted love, or such unrest
as Cupid will procure.
In youth when skill by practice commes,
the knowledge is profounde:
But who so loves when youth is spent
can not with Art abound.
The first taste of my spotless fame
unto thy share shall fall
And each of us at once shall be
to sinful lust in thrall.
It Is somewhat from the fraughted boughs
to pluck the fruit at full,
And Primrose with a nimble nail
from slender stalk to pull.
Even so the former brightness of
my passed age was clear,
Obscured with no cloudie crime,
as does in prouse appear.
But well it chances that I am
attacht with worthy flame,
A foul Adulter, than the fact
does breed a fouler shame.
Though Juno would to Phaedras use
of Jove renounce her right:
Yet Phaedra would Hippolytus
prefer with all her might.
And now (which thou would scarcely deem)
I am not as I was:
I have delight in quechie groves,
by brutish beasts to pass.
Now Dian with her bended how
and shaftes is all my care:
I yeel de me wholly to thy will,
in wrack and wealth to fare.
My pleasure is to haughty hills,
and bushie brakes to hie:
To pitch my hay, or with my Hounds
to raise a lusty cry.
Or else with weak and willing arm
a trembling dart to throw,
Or weary limbs in grass and greaues
with pleasure to bestow.
It Is often my practice in the plain
a Charret for to guide:
And with a bitte, to wrest and wind
the horse from side to side.
Sometimes by restless raging fittes
much like to Bacchus Nun,
Or to Cibeles brainsick Nymphs
in Ida Mount, I run.
Resembling those whom Dryades,
and Faunes do force to flee:
Whom Semigods we deemen and
half heavenly wightes to be.
This tale is told to me at large
when furious fittes are past:
To me I say, whose covert parts
with silent love do wast.
We may perhaps unto the fate
and fortune of our kind
Impute this love, and Venus longs
by tribute us to bind.
For first the fair Europa was
of mighty Jove imbrast:
Who in the figure of a Bull
did play a sluttish cast.
Another brutish Bull my Dame
Pasiphae beguilde:
Who with an ugly Monster was
by him begot with child.
False Theseus by my sisters shifts
and track of silken twine,
The crooked Cave and doubtful den
of Dedal fled in fine.
And last of all, least I should seem
to swerve from Minos trade,
The remnaunt of that noble race
the like attempt have made.
And that by fatal doom procurde,
one house two Nymphs has woonne:
My sister looude the father well,
and I embrace the son.
Two sisters were away conuaide
by thee, and by thy Sire:
Erect two Trophies of one house,
whereto you did aspyre.
That time when we in Athens did
to Ceres incense yield:
Would Gods that Gnosian quiet soil
in Creta me had held.
Then most of all (but ever well)
thou stoodste in Phaedras grace,
And chiefly tho thy piercesant love
my yielding heart did race.
Thy vesture was as white as snow,
and head with garlands decked:
Thy visage swarth, was seemly then
with Rosy red infect.
Thy countnance, which to other Dames
so clownish seems and grimme,
For clownish, comely Phaedra thinks
her eye does judge it trim.
Fie on those fond unmanly men
that seek in nice attire
Against their kind, the curious tricks
of women to aspyre.
Thee (Hippolyte) thy warlike face
and staring locks commend:
Thy countnance grymed all with dust
a comely shape does lend.
Where thou with Rain do rule thy horse
and gallop in the field:
I marvel at thy Art, that so
can force a Courser yield.
Or where thou with thy nymble arm
a thyrling Lance do cast:
I muse how such a slender Dart
should pierce the air so fast.
Or where thou hold thy hunting staff,
ytipt with stubburne steel,
Or ought do else, it glads my mind
my heart the joy does feel.
Wherefore, this rygor to the woods
and knarrie trees expel,
I am not she, that does deserve
to die for loving well.
O to what purpose will thou put
Dianas feats in proof,
And take from Venus all her due
and stand from her aloufe?
For what so lacks successiue rest
and respite after toil
Which should refresh the fainting limbs,
must needs sustain the foil.
For trial, take thy crooked bow
and let it stand ybent,
And never cease to shoot, and thou
shall feel his force relent.
Though Cephalus in silent woods
were wont to waste his time,
And kill his game with dexter hand
when savage were in prime:
Yet naythelesse to Auroras Couch
and Cabin would he wend:
In lothed Tythons woonted room
the joyful time to spynde.
Not once, nor twice, but sundry sithes
the Goddess Venus lay
With Adon in the waylesse woods
her pleasures to assay.
So with the fair Atlantas love
sir Meleager glowde,
Whom he in proof of perfect love
the monsters spoil allowde.
So let us now at length I pray,
be numbered with the mo:
The rudeness of your chase appears
if Venus it forgo.
My self will follow at a foot,
though rockie hills say nay:
No gnashing Bore with threatening tuskes
thy Phaedra shall affray.
Two seas there are that with their waves
enuiron Isthmos so,
That all the Island hears the floods
on either side that flo.
There I with thee in Trezen will
soiourne in Pytheus reign:
For now that soil contents me more
than all my Country vain.
Now loytring Theseus does dislodge,
not minding to retire
As yet, Perithous his friend
his presence does desire.
And least we should apparent truth
with froward will deny:
That Pyrrith he preferres before
our looues we may epsy.
And not this only wrong (though this
were much) we both endure:
But he in greater matters does
our open wrong procure.
My brothers bones with balefull blows
of knarrie clubbe he brake:
My sister eke suspecting naught,
this Theseus did forsake.
The chief of all the Amazons
for prowess and for fame
Thy Mother was, who well deserude
great favor for the same.
But if thou chance of her what is
become, demand to make:
Thou shall descrie that she her death
by Theseus sword did take.
And that before she was conioynde
in marriage. Wot you why?
For thou base borne should never reign
and Princes room supply.
And more than that, on me he gat
some Impes, whom Theseus wrath,
Not mine (I witness all the Gods)
too soon bereued has.
O Lord, what so she were alive
that would thy spoil intend:
Amidst her travel would her life
by shameful death might end.
Wherefore go too, do reverence
unto thy fathers bed:
Which he by his dishonest means
and faythlesse flight has fled.
Be not surprisde with foolish fear
nor rapt with gastfull awe,
That I thy lotted stepdame am,
and thou my Son in law.
These rytes and superstitions
by Saturn were maintainde:
But all such laws in future time
are like to be restrainde:
That rustie Saturn now is dead,
his statutes are all gone:
Now follow Jove, who gouernes all,
and reigns as Prince alone.
For Jove as lawful has allowde
what so may breed delight:
And now the brother may his faith
unto his sister plight.
They whom Dame nature had allyde
and linckt by law of kind,
By mutual love, and friendly league
the knot more firmly bind.
To keep in covert such delights
it is but slender skill,
The cloak of kindred will procure
the world to judge no ill.
When so our kissing shall be seen,
or clipping close be know:
That I a stepdame am so kind,
to both our praise will grow.
Thou shall not need to come by dark
or bleare the Porters eye
By coming to the lodging late
where I am wont to lie:
As we have soiournde long yfeare,
so we hereafter will:
And as we have in open kissed,
so may we franckly still.
With me thou may be safe and sound
thy fact shall purchase fame:
And though thou in my bed were seen
it will not breed thy shame.
Wherefore expel all fond delays.
and have to Venus joy:
So Cupid, that on me does rage,
procure thee none annoy.
Thou see I take not in disdain
in humble sort to sue:
Lord, where is all my pride become
and haughty words that flue?
I was in mind and fully bent
resistance to have made,
Reuolting aye: but now I see
no stay in Lovers trade.
Thus conquered, with erected hands
and falling at thy knee
I sue for grace. What best beseemes
we Lovers can not see.
Now honest shame has fled my face
and makes no longer stay:
Relent, and since I do confess,
rid rygor clean away.
Since Minos that does owe the Seas
my stately Sire is known,
Since from my Grandsires wreakfull hands
the thundering boltes are thrown:
Since Phaedra that does make request
of Phoebus line discendes,
Who to the soil his blazing brandes
for earthly comfort lendes:
(In this my love great honor lurckes)
let noble stocks dissent,
(If Phaedras suit may not be heard)
enforce thee to relent.
All Creta, where the mighty Jove
was fostred, is my dowre:
Which I will wholly yield to thee
to use thereon thy power.
Exile this ruthful rage, my Dame
a savage Bull could move:
More cruel than a brutish beast
will thou thy self approve?
For Venus sake I crave remorse,
whom I do honor feign:
So grant ye Gods that Hippolyte
may never love in vain.
Diana chaste in silent woods
so pressed be at thy call:
And Lawndes so lend thee store of game
to glad thy mind withal.
So Satyrs, friendly show your selves,
and Mountain Panes eake,
So on the cruel tusked Boar
thy Iauelaine may thou break.
So, (though thou hate the hurtlesse Nymphs)
let Nymphs from Crystal flood,
Allow the lycor to expel
thy thirst in desert wood.
Unto these mild requests of mine
I added tears withal:
When so thou read the lines, surmise
thou sawste the drops to fall.
The Argument of the fifth Epistle, entitled Oenone to Paris.
King Priamus wife with child,
and near her time, did dream
That she was brought abed with flash,
and flaming fiery stream.
The doubtful Sire demaundes
the Oracles advise.
Which told that damage by the Babe
to Troie should arise.
The father gave in charge
the child should die the death:
The Dame deliuerde sought the mean
to save her Babe his breath.
A Hyard bad the child,
that grown to man's estate,
Of Oenon was enamoured,
and took her to his Mate.
But when the Ladies strove
for beauty, Paris gave
His verdit on Dame Venus side:
that promisde he should have
In token of good will,
a passing wench for hew:
Mean while the Sire by secret signs
his son sir Paris knew.
To Greece the gallant goes
and steals Atrides wife,
That was the cause of wailefull war,
and root of ranckling strife.
Which when Oenone knew
(Report had blazed it so)
Agrieude she made her just complaint:
and prayde him to forgo
The wrongful Greekish rape,
and take her to his Feere,
The words she wrote with painful pen*
began as you shall hear.
The fifth Epistle. Oenone to Paris.
TO Paris that was once her own
though now it be not so,
From Ida, Oenon greeting sendes
as these her letters show.
May not thy novel wife endure
that thou my Pistle read?
That they with Grecian fist were wrought
thou needste not stand in dread.
Pegasian Nymph renoumde in Troie,
Oenone hight by name,
Of thee, (that were mine own) complain
if thou permit the same.
What froward God does seek to bar
Oenone to be thine?
Or by what guilt have I deserude
that Paris should decline?
Take patiently deserude woe
and never grutch at all:
But undeserved wrongs will grieve
a woman at the gall.
Scarce were thou of so noble fame.
as platly does appear:
When I (the offspring of a flood)
did choose thee for my Feere.
And thou, who now art Priams son,
(all reverence laid apart)
Were tho a Hyard to behold
when first thou wanste my heart.
How often have we in shadow lain
whylst hungry flocks have fed?
How often have we of grass and greaues
preparde a homely bed?
How often on simple stacks of straw
and bennet did we rest?
How often the dew and foggie mist
our lodging has oppressed?
Who first discouerde thee the holtes
and Lawndes of lurcking game?
Who first displaid thee where the whelps
lay sucking of their Dame?
I sundry times have help to pitch
thy toils for want of aid:
And forced thy Hounds to climb the hills
that gladly would have stayde.
The boysteous Beech Oenones name
in outward bark does bear:
And with thy caruing knife is cut
Oenon, every wheare.
And as the trees in time do wax
so does increase my name:
Go to, grow on, erect your selves,
help to advance my fame.
There grows (I mind it very well)
upon a banck, a tree
Whereon there does a fresh record
and will remain of me.
Live long thou happy tree, I say,
that on the brinck do stand:
And have ingraued in thy bark
these words, with Paris hand.
When pastor Paris shall reuolte.
and Oenons love forgo:
Then Xanthus waters shall recoyle,
and to their Fountains floe.
Now River backwarde bend thy course,
let Xanthus stream retier:
For Paris has renounst the Nymph
and prooude himself a lier.
That cursed day bred all my doole,
the winter of my joy,
With clouds of froward fortune fraught
procurde me this annoy:
When cankred crafty Juno came
with Venus, (Nurce of love)
And Pallas eke, that warlike wench,
their beauties pride to prove,
No sooner heard I of that hap
which thou thy self did tell,
But straight through all my quiuering bones
a trembling fear there fell.
And plunged all in doubtful dread,
of aged folks I sought
What might this ghastly matter mean:
some heinous thing they thought.
Then with a trice the trees were cut,
the timber went to wrack:
And tallowed Keales did forrow Seas
and made the Cabels crack.
At parture saltish tears were shed
thou can but say the same:
In faith this latter love of thine
deserves the greater shame.
Then showers of brackish brine began
of either side to rain:
And both repleate with grief alike
at parture began to plain.
Not Bacchus branches so embrace,
ne lymber limbs of vine
Enuiron that whereof it grows,
as thou this neck of mine.
How often were thou wroth with winds
when winds did serve thee well?
Thy journey Mates began to smyle
when they thy sleightes did smell.
How often did thou me sweetly kiss
and then vnkisse again?
How did thy (last adue) procure
thy foltring tongue to pain?
With wished wind thy sails were stust
that hoong upon thy Mast:
The waters waxte as green as grass
the Oars went on so fast.
With sight as long as sight would serve,
thy Barcke I did pursue
And when mine eye might see no more,
my heart began to rue.
To green Neriedes I did fue
that thou might soon retire:
And I (to further this my woe)
thy gainecome did desire.
Whose coming is to others use
procured by my suit:
(Alas) of all my traueling toil
a harlot has the fruit.
A huge and haughty hill there is
that gapes into the flood,
Repelling all the waltring waves
that beat his banck a good.
From thence I took my prime prospect
and knew full well thy ship:
A sudden joy well nigh had made
me from the Mount to skippe.
But whilst I stayde, I saw in top
a purple banner shine:
Which colors made me sore adradde,
I knew they were not thine.
The ship that slacked not to sail
came by and by to shore,
With quaking heart I saw a Less
I never knew before.
Ne yet could that perdie suffice,
(but wherefore made I stay?)
The hateful harlot out of hand
her manners did display.
Then mourning began I rent my Robes,
then beat I on my breast:
And with unfriendly fist my face
in wailefull wise was dressed.
My yelling clamours Ida heard,
and witnesde all my woe:
I carred thither to my Cotte
my tears, that fell as snow.
So grant ye Gods that Helen rue
and spoiled of her Make,
Of these my griefs procurde by her
the greatest share may take.
Now have thou brought them home by Seas
and over wandered waves.
That have their loyal husbands fled
and left as loathsome slaves:
But when thou were in vile estate
and led a Hyards life:
Poor Paris had but Oenon tho
to his approved wife.
I am not she that weighes thy wealth
thy Palace mooues me naught:
Ne to be Priams daughter I
by earnest suit have sought.
Yet needelesse is that Priam should
of such a daughter shame:
What should procure old Hecuba,
to blush to be my Dame?
I well deserude, and very feign
a Princes spouse would be:
A Scepter would beseem my hand
and passing well agree.
Though I with thee in open holte
amid the sedge were seen:
Disdain me not, a purple bed
were fitter for a Queen.
In fine my love is void of dread
thou needste not war at all:
Revenger ships are not in sight
to sack the Trojan wall.
But hateful Helen is requirde
with wreakefull war again:
This is a dainty dowre in deed
where bloodshed is the gain.
Ask Hectors counsel in this case
where thou should her restore;
Deiphobus, Polydamas,
with other Trojans more.
Let sage Antenors tale be heard,
let Priam give advise:
For they by long expense of years
have gotten to be wise.
It is a shameful thing in deed
a strumpet to prefarre:
The goodness of thy cause appears,
the Greeks do justly war.
May thou assure her to be true
or ought in her affie,
Whom thou so quickly wanst with words
and made her country fly?
As young Atrides does lament
and sorrow this his fate,
And takes in grief a stranger should
enjoy his wedded Mate:
So Paris shall in process prove
and swear that gaged faith
Once faleed, may not be restorde
till life do end by death.
Put case she love thee (Paris) well,
so did she love the Greek:
But now the fiely man is sole,
his Helen is to seek.
Thrice happy was sir Hectors wife,
her luck was passing good:
Thou should have followde Hectors trade
and to thy bargin stood.
More light art thou than partched leaves
when suck and sap is lost,
That with the wind for want of weight
from place to place are tossed.
In thee less surety to be found
than weight in bearde of wheat,
That is surprisde with Sunnie rays
and Phoebus fervent heat.
I call to mind thy sisters sawes
which tho I took as vain:
The Prophetess pronounst in prouse
that now is passing plain.
What madness makes thee thus inragde
to sow thy seed in sand:
O Nymph (she said) with bootelesse Plough
thou breakste a barraine land.
A Greekish Hayfer comes to Troie,
that both thy Country soil
And thee, thy house, (which Gods forefend)
will bring to utter foil.
With speed go sincke that shameful ship,
let drown the beastly Barcke
That fraughted is with Phrygian blood,
repleate with Trojan carcke.
No sooner had this Sibyll said,
her Vassels thought her wood:
But I with quaking fear was rapt,
my hair erected stood.
Thy words (Cassandra) were of weight,
thou art a Sibyll true:
The Hayfer leapes within my leaze
that makes my heart to rue.
Surpassing though her beauty be
dishonest is her life,
That leaves her Country Gods, and is
become a strangers wife.
Once was she erst away conuayde
from Greece by Theseus theft:
I wot not by what Theseus, but
by Theseus was she reft.
Might she with Maidenhead make retire
from such a wanton guest?
No, no, I know the trade of love
as well as does the best.
Well, pose it to be rape and stealth,
so cloak the crime with name:
Yet she that was so often wrongde
assented to the same.
Oenon never swarude her Hest
though Paris were unjust:
Of right thou should have been beguilde
in whom was slender trust.
Sage, swift, and seemly Satyrs would
with me been coupled feign,
Whom they in leauie woods have sought
with great and grieffull pain.
The fonded Faunus often in I Would
my friendship did request:
Whose head with hurelesse horns, and boughs
of Pine was bravely dressed.
The faithful Phoebus (Trojans trust
and rampire) looude me well:
Until such time my dainty fruit
unto sir Phoebus fell,
And that by force: in proof whereof
I rent his golden hair,
And scratcht his face with froward fist,
the signs as yet appear.
No Jewels I, ne Gemmes receiude
for filthy lukers hyre:
It Is beastly so t'ingage the corpse
for greedy mucks desire.
He deemde it recompense enough
his Physic to bestow:
My skillesse band and barraine skull
he taught his Art to know.
What herb soever were of power
or virtue to recure,
To learn his force and lurcking might
I could my self assure.
Aye me, the most unhappy wench,
vnluckiest under Sun:
Though I in Physic have good sight
by love my skill is wunne.
Apollo Physic that diuisde
Admetus flock did feed:
And had his godly breast incenst
with Oenons partching gleede.
But Paris worst thou what? the health
that neither herbs may lend
Ne Gods may grant, thy friendly fist
at once to me may send.
Thou can, and I have well deserude,
take mercy of a Maid:
I come not like a Greekish foe,
Atrides power to aid.
But thine I am, and from thy youth
thy lover have I been:
And will whilste (lungs shall lend me breath)
thy faithful friend be seen.
The Argument of the sixth Epistle, entitled Hypsiphyle to Jason.
THe Oracle pronounste
to Pelyas, that he
Should then in danger stand of death
when be did chance to see
One barefoote, doing rytes
unto his Fathers ghost:
It Was Iasons hap to mecte him,
that by hap his shoe had lost
In flood Auaurus foord.
The Uncle waying than
The prophecy, to stand in doubt
of dreadful death began,
To Colchos he per swades
the lusty youth to fleet
To fet the golden Fleese
a spoil for such a Gallant meet,
In hope the dangers would
the wanton wight deuourde
Sir Jason with a troop of Greeks
through chocking channel scourde.
At Lemnos he at length
and all his route arriude,
An Isle where cursed women had
their husbands lives depriude.
Hypsiphyle the Queen
did entertain the Greek
And all his train, for courtesy
they never saw the like,
There two years he soiournde,
his Mates at last bespake
Their Captain; and persuade him thence
his voyage on to take:
The Queen was great with Babe,
away the Grecians go,
Ariude at Colch he wanne the Fleese
Medea looude him so.
The conqueror conueyes
the Maid with him to Greece:
Which Queen Hypsiphyle hearing off,
and of his pretty piece,
Repynde at Jason sore;
that Medea had possessed.
The place which she had woonne before
by using well her guest.
She joys at his return,
the Witch she felly hates,
And thus with joyful Jason in
her Pistle she dehates:
The sixth Epistle. Hypsiphyle to Jason.
THe flickring fame reports
that to Thessalia soil
Thou art with luckie Barck returnde,
enricht with golden spoil.
I joy (as much as thou will give me leave mine own)
To hear thy health, but yet I should
thereof by letter known.
For that thou should not leave
my land at thy return
Unseen: thou could not have the winds
to serve thy hoped turn.
Thou should have sent me lines
though weather did not serve:
I stand assurde that Hypsiphyl
a greeting did deserve.
Why came report before
thy Letters made me show,
That bluddy Mars his sacred Bulls
the pinching yoke did know?
And that of scattred seed
there weapned Wightes arose?
And that thy balefull hand was pressed
to deal them deadly blose?
And that the waker Fenne
the glittering spoil did keep:
Which thou in fine with manly hand
have reft the shining sheep?
To such as hardly would
believe the wonders told,
How blessed were I, if I my vaunt
thus Jason wrote. Behold.
What shall I say thou have
not playde the husbands part?
So I be thine, thy friendship far
surmounts my small desert,
The brute does blast there is
a barbarous Witch arriude
With thee, who has me of my spouse
and bridely bed depriude.
Love lightly will believe:
would God I might be sed
A rashfull Dame, and false reports
of Jason to have spread.
A guest of Thessal came
from Hemus parts of late,
Who scarcely had set foot within
my unacquainted gate.
How fares my Love (quoth I)
old Aesons son I pray?
But he with countnance cast to ground
for shame had naught to say.
Then forth I skipt in have,
and renting mine attire:
Lives he (quoth I) or do the fates
my death also require?
He lives (quoth he) an oath
in proof thereof I crave:
I made him swear, yet to his Gods
I hardly credit gave.
When to my self I came,
thy manfull acts to know
I long: and he how Mars his Bulls
had turnde the soil did show.
He said that snakie teeth
for seed were cast on land:
And vpstart men with armor cladde
both sword and shield in hand.
And that the earthly brood
in civil war was slain:
And in a day lost sudden life
by sudden death again.
And of the Serpents fall.
again where Jason lives
I ask. So hope and doubtful dread
for chiefest credit strives.
Whilst he each thing displayes
desirous for to prate:
He makes me show how thou have wrongde
thy loyal spouse of late.
O where is plighted faith?
where nuptial oaths and band?
And that which should been cast in flame,
I mean the spousall brande?
Thou knowste me not by stealth,
Dame Juno was in place,
(Who has the marrige charge) and there
did Hymen show his face.
But neither Juno did
nor Hymen hold the light:
Some fury fell with bloudshot eyes
did frame this cankred spite.
Why I with Minyes did deal?
or Pallas sacred pine?
Or (Tiphus) what have thou to do
with any soil of mine?
Here was no famous Ram
with fleese of glowing gold:
In Lemnos was no Palace for
your aged Prince to hold.
First was I fully bent,
(but destnie me withdrue)
By woman's power to put them off
and wandering guestes subdue:
For Lemnian Ladies know
too well to war with men:
My life with such a valiant troop
should have been guarded then.
I gave the man at once
my hostage and my heart:
For two years date thou werte with me,
and never did depart.
When third Autumn came on
that thou of force were feign
To hoyse thy fayles: these words thou spakste
with gushing tears amain:
Mine own I must depart,
if Fortune say Amen,
From hence I pass thy spouse, and will
thy spouse repasse again.
The Impe within thy Womb
Gods grant that it may live:
And we his parents both yfeare
a decent name may give.
Thus much (I mind) thou spakste,
when salted tears berainde
Thy falsed face, the remnant of
thy sermon was restrainde.
The last of all thy Mates
thou clambst the sacred Arge,
That spinde along, thy sails did stroute
they had so great a charge.
The ship was shooude apace
upon the grayish flood:
Thou threwste thine eyes to shore, and we
to Seawarde lookte agood.
There stands a Turret by
that ouerlookes the place:
To whom I ran, and did with tears
imbrue both breast and face.
I looked through my tears,
mine eye as friendly light
Had larger kenning than of course,
and farther stretched his sight.
Add thereunto my vows
and Prayers ioynde with dred:
Which sacred vows I will perfect
since thou have happily sped.
But shall I pay my vows?
shall Medea them enjoy?
My heart does ache, and wrath with love
combyned does annoy.
Shall I bear gifts to Church
or be at charge at all?
To loose my loving Jason should
there any Hayfer fall?
I was not calm in mind,
I always stood in awe
Thy Father would not entertain
in Greece a daughter law.
Of Greece I was in dreede,
but other work my woe:
I have receyude a hurt of one
whom erst I did not know.
By beauty nor desert
she won thee, but by charm:
With Sorcerers Sith she sheares the Grass
whereby she works thy harm.
She says from woonted track
the waywarde Moon to wrie:
And dim with duskie cloud the steedes
that praunce in open sky.
She bridles running streams
and fleeting floods does stay:
She makes the Holtes and ragged rocks
for joy to skip and play.
Dissheueld with her locks
she walks by burial graves:
And certain of the loathsome hones
from wasting flame she faues.
She curses absent wightes,
of Wax she pictures makes:
And pricks with pinnes the pensive lungs
wherewith the bowels aches.
Thus Love that should be won
with beauty and desarte:
Is got (which would I had not tryde)
by Herbs and hurtful Art.
What? can thou roll and clip
or sleep in self same bed
With her, deuoide of waking care
and free from carking dred?
As erst she yokte the Bulls
so has she bound thee fast:
And tamde thee, as the Dragons fell
were conquerde by her cast.
To that she spoils both thee
and all thy Mates of praise:
And by the mean of such a wife
the husbands fame decays.
In Thessalie are some
to poison that impute
Thy factes: and there will be enough
which will believe the brute.
Not this old Aesons son
but Oeetes daughter wrought:
It Was she, not Jason, that the fleese
of Gold from Colchos brought.
Ask Alcimedes advise,
thy Dame does this disleeke:
Thy Father eke from chilly Role
who did a daughter seek.
Let her to Tanays go
and seek in Scythian soil
Her loving spouse, and gape for him
from Phasis farthest goyle.
Fie, faythlesse Jason, fie,
more light than windy blast:
Why do not thou thy painted words
with deed confirm at last?
Thou partedst hence my spouse,
why art not so returnde?
O bar not that at gainecome which
at parture was not wournde.
If Noble line thou like,
and gentry move thy mind:
That I King Thoas dearling was
and daughter may thou find.
My Grandsire Baechus was,
and Bacchus wife ycrownde
Does far surpass the lesser lights
that her enuiron round.
Lemnos shall be my dowre,
as fruitful as the best
To such as there soiourne: and me,
accoumpt among the rest.
Who now am brought a bed,
let dubble joy possess
Thy heart, the Father made the throws
of travail seem the less.
The number gladdes my mind,
( Lucina thancked be)
Of good success, a luckie twinne
to light are brought by me.
Whose shape and show they bear
if thou demand, I vaunt
Thou may be known by them, save they
the fathers fraud do want.
Whom I was even at point
by Legates to conuaie,
Save that the cruel stepdame was
the only cause of stay.
Medea made me dreede,
who justly may be thought
More than a stepdame, with her hand
each cursed fact is wrought.
She that her Brothers bones
and flesh could fling in field,
Rent first with cruel fist: would she
have ruth upon my child?
Yet her the fame reports,
(O wood and wretched Wight)
That thou before thy Hypsiphyl
preferrste with all thy might.
She going for a Maid
has playde a harlots cast:
But with unspotted bridely chain
we two were lincked fast.
Her Father she betrayde,
I saude King Thoas life:
She fled from Colche, in Lemnos I
remain thy loving wife.
But whereto? if a Drabbe
an honest woman win?
And that her crimes for iointure have
and stead of dowry binne?
I blame the Lemnian Maids,
I muse not at their deed:
For dolor to the angry will
bring wreakefull tools with speed.
Say on, if forced with winds
(as right did will thee do)
Both thou and all thy troop at once
my Port had commen too:
And I with this my brood
had met thee at the door:
Then would thou not have wished the gasping
soil thy corpse devour?
(Unthrifty) with what face
upon those Babes and me
Would thou have lookte? fie traitor what
had been fit death for thee?
Thou might have liude at ease
and safe by my consent:
Not for thou did deserve so well,
but cause I did relent.
I with that Wytchesse blood
my face should have imbrude:
And Iasons eke, which with her Herbs
the Harlot did delude.
To Medea I should
have been Medea then:
(And if in skies be any Jove
that will give ear to men)
As Hypsiphyl does plain
and sobbe alone her fill:
So let that beast (Medea) mourn
plagude with her handie skill.
And as I lose my Impes
and am bereft my Make:
So grant, that her as many babes
and husband may forsake.
Ne that she may retain
but leave with worser hap
Ill gotten goods: and banished beg
her bread with dish and clap,
As loouing sister she
and daughter eke has been
To Father and to Brother both:
Gods grant she may be seen
So spiteful to her Spouse,
and armde with prefull rage
Even to her tender Children whom
she ought to guard in age.
When Sea and Land she has
consumde, up to the sky
Let her go rangle like a Rogue
and by selfeslaughter die.
Thus I bereft my spouse
King Thoas daughter pray:
In cursed Cabin lead your lives
you beastly folks I say.
The Argument of the vij. Epistle, entitled Dido to Aeneas.
WHen Priam was oppressed
and Troie brought to sack,
Aeneas with his aged Sire
and Relics on his back,
Ingagde himself to Seas
and shope his course aright:
But yet at length it was his luck
on Libie land to light
By force of froward flood,
where Dido began to raise
A stately town. The courteous Queen
the wandering Trojan prays
To make abode with her:
she likte Aeneas so,
As host age with her heart at once
on him she did bestow.
The messenger at length
from mighty Jove was sent
To new Carthago to demand
the Trojan what he meant
In Libie land to lodge
and loyter so in love,
And not to seek the lotted land,
that was for his behoue.
Away the Trojan trudgde,
whose will when Dido knew
Was fully bent to leave her land:
the Princess began to sue,
That either he would stay
according to his hest,
Or grant her space to banish grief
from her agrieued breast.
When she had wasted words
and many tears yshed,
At point of death the quiuering Queen
thus to Aeneas sed.
The.vij. Epistle. Dido to Aeneas.
EVen so when fates do call
ystrecht in moysted spring,
Upon Meanders winding banches
the snowishe Swanne does sing.
Not for I think my words
may ought prevail, I write:
For why I know the haughty Gods,
at this my purpose spite.
But since my fame, my corpse,
and spotless mind are lost
By cankred hap: to wast my words
I reck it little cost.
Now art thou bent to pass
and leave poor Dido so:
And with the self same winds thy sails
and fickle faith shall go.
Aeneas now thou mindste
thy Navy with thy vow
To lose: and seek Italia land
but where, thou doste not know.
Not Carthage built anewe,
ne yet the rising wall,
No not my stately Scepter may
convert thy mind at all.
Thou fleest the thing atchiude
for those that are not done:
Thou have been in one land, and now
wilt to another run.
Suppose thou find an I Will,
who will give thee the place
To rule? will any yield his soil
to men of foreign race?
New love remaynes for thee
another Dido eake,
With other troth to be impaunde
which thou again may break.
When will it be that thou will build Carthagos peer?
Or vewe from Turrets top a troop
of such as soiourne here?
Though all these came to pass
and thou had wish at will:
Yet where would thou have such a spouse
to bear thee like good will?
Even as a waxen Torch
with Sulphur touched I burn
Both day and night to Didos thought
Aeneas makes return.
Even that ungrateful guest
that scorns the gistes I gave:
And he, whom I might want full well
as wisdoms loare does crave.
Yet hate I not the man
though he deserve dispight:
But make complaint of his untruth,
and less embrace the wight.
O Venus, use her well
that married with thy Son:
O Cupide, friend thy brother, let
him in thy number run:
Or else let him (for why
I ne disdain to love)
Whom I began to fancy, force
me greater cares to prove.
I see I am deceyude,
his Image bleard my sight:
He differs from his mothers trade
and swarues her manners quight.
Thee rocks and ragged Hills
and Oaks in Mountains bred
Begat, and thou of brutall beasts
in desert have been fed,
Or of the goulfe, which now
thou see turmoylde with wind:
On whom (though waves rebel) to pass
thou fixed have thy mind.
Why? whither fleest? the storms
do rage: let storms have power
To aid my case, see how the Seas
do surge with Eurus sco wre.
Let me indebted be
to storms, for that which I
Had rather owe to thee: more just
than whom the waves I try.
I am not so much worth
(though thy desert be small)
That fleeing me by waltring Seas
thou lose thy life and all.
Thy hate is dear in deed
and of no slender price,
If whilst thou go from me, to die
thou reck it but a trice,
Within a while the Seas
will cease their swelling tide:
And Triton with his grayish Steede^
on calmed waves will ride.
O that with winds thou would
exchange thy ruthlesse mind:
And so thou will, unless of Oaks
thou pass the stubburne kind.
What if thou did not know
how raging Seas could rore?
Yet thou that have so often tryde
wilt travail as before?
Though waves were never so smouth
when thou should leave the bay:
Yet dure and dooleful things God wot
might happen by the way.
And further, they that false
their faith in danger are
On perilous seas: the place with them
for treasons guilt does war.
And most when love is wrongde,
cause Venus has been thought
To Have had her offspring of the waves
that in Cytheris wrought.
I fear least I undone
shall be thy cause of woe:
Or least by wrack of ship I should
endaunger thee my foe.
I pray thee live, for so
I may revenged be
Far better than by death: thou shall
be said to murder me.
Put case, that thou were caught
with sway of whirling wind:
(But vain be this abodement fell)
what then would be thy mind?
Then would thou often revoke
to thought the Phrygian tongue,
That did pronounce the periurde talk
which wrought poor Didos wrong.
Before thine eyes the form
and Idol of thy Feere
Deceyude, would stand in saddest sort,
with bloody feltred here.
Thy self would grant, thou had
deserude these torments all:
And think the thunder cast on thee
what so should hap to fall.
Wherefore give time to wrath
and rage of roaring flood:
Great is the price of little stay,
thy passage will be good.
Have no respect to me?
yet spare Iulus breath:
Suffices thee to have been thought
the Author of my death.
What poor Ascanius has
or Country Gods deserude?
The Sea shall sinck the Saints, which were
from Phrygian flame preserude.
But neither thou thy Sire
ne private Gods did bear
Upon thy back: thy vaunting crakes
these to Elisa were.
Thou list at every word,
not now thy tongue does ginne
To gloze, ne I the first in trappe
and guilefull snare has binne.
If question were what of
Iulus Dame became:
Her cruel husband her forsook
to his eternal shame.
This thou to me displayste.
which made my breast to bend:
Much sooner will my torment find
than this my crime an end.
And I do nothing doubt
but that thy guilty mind
Will thee condemue. Thou seven years space
no resting place could find.
At length I gave thee port,
cast up on blisfull shore:
And did infeffe thee with my Realm
thy name scarce told before.
Would Gods this had been all
the friendship I had shown:
And that report of bedding had
not been so lightly blown.
That day procurde my bale
in which for sudden rain
That pourde adowne, to couch in one
self Cave we both were feign.
I heard a voice, I thought
the Nymphs had howlde for joy:
But they were Furies that forespake
of this my fell annoy.
Now broken faith I owde
to old Sichaeus name,
On me take vengeance, that to Hell
must go bereft of shame.
In shrine of Marble made
I have Sichaeus bones,
Whom boughs and snowwhite fleeses shroude
appointed for the nones.
Four times with wonted mouth
he callde me to the place:
To whom with whispring voice, he said
come Dido, come apace.
Without delay I came
sometime thy wedded Feere:
But this my shameful fact procurde
me slacker to appear.
Forgive my fault, alykeloe
man has me betrayde:
And one that hatred of the fact
and foul despite has stayde.
His Dame a heavenly wight,
his Sire on shoulders borne
Did force me judge he would have stayde,
and not have been forsworn.
If needs I must have errde,
this error has a show
Of just pretense: Be true and then
I shall not yrke it so.
But as my life at first
unlucky was begone:
Even so the tenor of the same
to latter day does run.
At sacred Altars slain
my husband fell to ground,
And of the fact the spoil unto
Pigmalion did redound.
I as a wight exilde
my native soil did lose:
And left the cynders of my spouse
pursude by wreakefull fose.
At length escaping Seas
and brothers wrath, was brought
To coast unknown, where all the soil
I gave to thee I bought.
I framde it up a town,
and with far stretching wall
Enuironde it, to neighbor towns
which was a deadly gall.
Then battayles broyle began,
with war a foreign wight,
And fielie woman was pursude
when gates was scarcely pight.
A thousand suitors came
which jointly did complain
That I a rascal had preferrde,
and had them in disoaine.
Why staggerest thou to yield
me to Hiarbas hands?
My self will stretch mine arms abroad
to bide thy cursed bands.
I have a brother eke
whose hungry hand does long
For Didos blood, as erst it did
Sichaeus life to wrong.
Lay down thy Gods prophande
and Relics brought to land:
It fittes thee not such facred things
to touch with hurtful hand.
If thou of force were he
that should transport the same,
Reserude from fire: no force had been
if they had burnt in flame.
(Vnthrist) perhaps thou leauste
thy Dido great with child:
And in my womb is part of thee
whom thou have so beguilde.
The miser Impe will add
unto his Mothers death:
So thou shall kill a fiely Babe
that never tasted breath.
Iulus Brother with
his Dame shall so be slain:
And one self torment shall bereus
the lively powers of twain.
But God does force thee flee,
would God had kept away
Such guilefull guestes, and Trojans had
in Carthage made no stay.
No doubt that God procures
the waywarde winds to blow:
And makes thee waste the weary time
in sandy Seas so flow.
As when that Hector liude
if Troie stood again)
To pass to Troie thou scarcely should
endure a greater pain.
But not to Symois thou
but Tiber mindst to pass:
Arrived there, yet shall thou be
a stranger naythelasse.
Thou seekste a lurcking land
and uncouth place to hold:
Which scarce will be thy lot to find
till thou be waren old.
Ambages laid aparte,
more better were for thee
Pigmalions wealth to have in hand
and soiourne here with me.
With luckie hap to Tire
thy Trojan stock transport:
And sacred Scepter hold in hand
in place of Princely port.
But if thou long for war,
or young Iulus seek
By manly Mart to Purchase praise
and give his foes the gleeke:
Cause naught should want, he shall
have foes to wreake his wrath:
This place of laws and arms good store
and broyling battayles has.
For old Anchises sake
and bow of Venus Boie:
For all those sacred Gods which thou
have safely brought from Troie:
So Gods agree that they
which from thy Country came,
May Victors be, and all mishap
convert to gladsome game:
And young Ascanius live
white silver locks to have,
And old Anchises broosed bones
may lodge in quiet grave:
I pray thee spare the house
that yeeldes it self to thee,
Save that I looude, what crime at all
may thou impute to me?
Not I from Phthia came,
ne from the Mycene line:
My husband ne my father were
no spiteful foes of thine.
Thine Hostess let me be
if of thy spouse thou shame:
So I remain thy Dido still
I force not on the name.
The waves on Afrus bancks
that beat I know full well:
Sometime they favor passengers
sometimes they do rebel.
Then launch thy ship from shore
when weather does apply,
But now the weeds will let thy Barcke
on waltring Seas to hie.
Give me in charge to mark
the Tide, and then be bold
To furrow floods: though thou would stay
then will I not withholde.
Thy weary wandering Mates
do lack, and look for rest:
Thy Navy feign would stay, till time
her tackle were adrest.
For my deserts, and that
which after I shall owe
To thee, for marrige hope do not
as yet thy thrall forgo:
Till surge of Seas do cease
and love do temper trade:
Mean while for to sustain the worst
I stronger shall be made.
If not, I mind to waste
my loathsome life ere long:
It is but for a time that thou
shall work poor Dido wrong.
Mine image whilst I write
O that thou sawste with eye:
I write, and in my lap the while
thy Trojan sword does lie:
Down by my cheeks the tears
upon the weapon fall:
Which now in stead of brine with blood
shall be imbrued all.
Full well thy gifts agree
to this my wretched fate:
My grave shall be small charge to thee
unsitting to my state.
Not now my breast at furst
with cruel Lance is pierst
That place with dure and deadly dinte
has Cupid crased erst.
Thou sister (Anne) that wast
of counsel in this case:
Now offer up thy latter boon
to Dido in the place.
When that my corpse is burnt,
I will not then be sed
Sichaeus Dido: on my Hearse
this scripture shall be red.
Aeneas gave the cause
and sword wherewith I did:
But desperate Dido on her self
her ruthlesse hand has tryde.
The Argument of the viij. Epistle, entitled Hermione to Orestes.
BEfore the stir at Troie to Pyrrhus was
Hermion by sir Menelaus behight:
The Father having cause from Greece to pass
To quail the courage of his foes in fight,
Left all the rule to Tyndarus, that than
Despoused Hermion to another man.
Orestes had a promise of the piece,
Who thought him self assured of a Mate:
But when proud Pyrrhus made return to Greece
He reft the Maid, whom she pursude with hate:
For that in deed she looude Orestes so,
As loath she was with Achylls Son to go.
But choice was none to choose: she naythelasse
By secret stealth aduertisde him that she
Might rescude be, and from his Prison pass.
Which fell in fine: for when Aegysthus he
The Lecher had despoylde and Mother eake,
Orestes gave Achylles Son the gleake.
The.viij. Epistle. Hermione to Orestes.
TO him that both my spouse of late
and brother was I wright:
My brother now, for of my spouse
another has the right.
That Pyrrhus, that Achylles steps
for courage does ensue:
Against law and right has closde me up
and keeps me fast in mue:
As much as lay in me to do
I stoutly did withstand:
But I could do no more than might
a weak and woman's hand.
What do thou (Pyrrhus) now quoth I?
will none revenged be
Think thou? I am but as a Maiden
servant unto thee.
He deffer than the ruthlesse waves
when I (Orestes) caulde:
Me by the locks with cruel hand
into his Cabin haulde.
If Trojan Dames me thrall had taken
or Lacedemon won:
I should no worse have been abusde
than now by Achylls Son.
More friendly found Andromache
Achaias famous soil:
When with the ghastly Grecian flame
the Trojan wealth did broyle.
But oh Orestes (if to me
thou have respect at all)
Lay hands on that which is thine own,
and to thy booty fall.
What? if by falsehoode from thy fold
thy flock be borne away,
Will thou take arms? and for thy spouse
to fight in field wilt stay?
Let Menelaus myrrour be
that for his rapted wife
Did undertake such honest war
and stirde such stately strife.
Who if had slept and slugde at home
or loytred like an Ass:
My Dame had been to Paris linckte
as to my Sire she was.
Thou have no need a thousand ships
or bending sails so have,
Nor any Greekish Souldiars help,
thy only aid I crave.
Yet rather so (than not at all)
I should be fette again:
It Is famous for a man to fight
if wedlock suffer stain.
What? was not Grandsire to us both
Atreus King Pelops son?
At least thou art my bresher, if
the marrige were undone.
I pray thee Brother help thy Sister,
husband help thy Feere,
A dubble title will procure
thee in my cause to steer.
My Grandsire for his aged years
and wisdom passing grave,
(Who of his Niece had all the rule)
me to Orestes gave:
To Pyrrhus not acquainted with
the match, my Father vowde:
But most of both my Grandsires dead
as caldste should be allowde
When I with thee conidynde, I wrongde
none by my spousall right
But if I ^incke with Pyrrhus, their
from thee I am not quight.
My Father Menelaus will
wincke at my fact I know:
For cause himself has felt the force
of winged Cupids bow.
That will he grant his son in law
which he himself has looude:
My Dames example aids my case
that Venus sportes has prooude.
Look what my Sire is to my Dame,
even that art thou to me:
The slipper practice Paris playde,
with Pyrrhus does agree.
And he is stout and stately for
the factes his Sire has done:
So thou may brag and boaste upon
the spoils thy Father won.
Who all the trowpe of Tantals train,
Achylles eke did lead:
A chieftaine he among the Dukes,
a Soldier stout at neade.
Thy Grandsire great King Pelops was,
and Pelops worthy Sire,
And if thou coumpte aright from Jove
thou art the fifth esquire.
Thy manhood is well known enough,
thou foughtste I wot well when:
But what should thou do in that case?
thy mother slew the man.
Would God upon a better cause
thy stoutness had been wrought:
Yet dare I vaunt the cause was given
to thee, and never sought.
But thou did bring it to effect
that Aegisthe did with gore
Of gaping wound defile the flower
as had thy Sire before.
And thereof Pyrrhus often prates,
and to reproach does wrye
Thy earned praise, and yet endures
my presence with his eye.
I frette, and as my face does puff,
so swelles mine inward mind:
And burning breast with silent flame
of dolor scorcht I find.
Before Hermions face imbrayded
should Orestes be?
I want but force and brainsick blade
to be reuengde for thee.
But weep and wayle I may my fill
which lessens part of woe:
And down on either side my face
my tears as conduites floe.
Them only to command I have
and out I pour them still:
Alongste my stained theekes each hours
the welling tears do trill.
This fortune follows all our race
and to our age is brought:
And all that are of Tantals line
a seemly rape are thought.
I will not hete allege the lies
of false and feigned Swanne:
Ne yet complain that Jove in plume
did lurck both God and manne.
Where Isthmos streatching out at length
two Seas did so divide:
Hippodamie on waxen wheels
and counterfaite cart did ride.
Fair Helen once conuaide away
by crafty Theseus train,
By Castor and sir Pollux was
in fine restorde again.
The selfsame Lady through the Seas
by Trojan guest was brought:
For whom the noble Greekish Peers
in wreakefull manner fought.
I scarce remember, yet I mind
how tho the people wept,
In mournful mood: and dismoll dread
into their hearts it crept.
The Grandsire gronde, the sister sobde,
the brothers began to broyle:
Lamenting Leda with the Gods
and Jove did keep a coil.
And I with locks not long as then
rent all about my hedde
Exclamde, O mother leauste me thus?
and from thy child art fled?
(For then her husband was a lack.)
and least I should be sed
No Impe of Pelops brood, I am
a pray by Pyrrhus led.
O that Achylles had been free
and scapte Apollos bow:
Then would he blame the beastlye rage
of Pyrrhus pride I know.
It never pleased, ne now would like
Achylles, if he liude,
To hear a wifebounde Wight lament
of lyked love depriude.
What guilt of mine has made the Gods
and Heavenly powers so rage?
What cursed star might I accuse
to govern thus my age?
My Dame I was bereft in youth,
my father waged war:
And though they both did live, yet I
from them was kept afar.
Not I to thee in tender years,
nor Cradell clowtes did cry
Dear mother mine: nor from my lips
the lisping words did fly.
Ne did I with my pliaunt arms,
thy seemly neck enfolde:
Nor thou upon thy loving lap
thy babbling Brat did hold.
No carke of clothing me, ne care
did pierce thy pensive breast:
Ne did thou cause a marrige bed
for Bridewife to be dressed.
But when thou did return again
(the troth I not deny)
I met thee, but my Mothers face
I could not then descrie.
But for thy beauty did surpass,
for Helen thee I took:
And thou did make inquiry then,
and for thy daughter look.
Good hap in one respect I had,
that Oreste was my Make:
But he unless he fight it out
Hermion must forsake.
Me Pyrrhus as a Vassell keeps
though Victor be my Sire:
This goodly guerdon have I gainde
for Troie burnt with fire.
When golden Titan ginnes to guide
his glistring steades by day,
Then I (unhappy wenche) some ease
of pensive pain assay.
No fooner blackfaste night does grow,
in howling sort I hie
Unto my cankred careful couche
appointed there to lie.
In place of sweet and slumbring sleeps
mine eyes with tears do floe:
And from the man in all post haste
I flee as from a foe.
Often times mishaps do make me muse,
unmindful of my case
I touch with hand proud Pyrrhus parts
unwitting of the place.
I leave to touch the man as soon
as ever I know the fact:
And think my hands polluted straight
with such a shameful act.
Often times for Neoptolems name
Orestes do I call:
And love the error of my tongue,
right well content withal.
I swear by this unlucky line
and Lord of all the race,
That Land and Seas yea haughty skies
afrayes with frowning face:
And by the bones of him that was
mine Uncle and thy Sire:
Who owes thee for revenge of those
that did his death conspire:
Or I will in these flowring years
abandon loathsome life:
Or I (that came of Tantals brood)
will be Orestes wife.
The Argument of the ix. Epistle, entitled Deianeira to Hercules.
THe heavy stepdame Juno by her fraud
And friend Eurystheus, purposde to destroy
Alcydes: for the Prince of Mycene land
Stirrde him to conquer Monsters. But with laud
And life he escaped away, nor had annoy
By any beast the Champion took in hand:
Bulls, Dragons, Dogs, and Semitaurs he slew,
And aye more green his gotten glory grew.
He conquered all, till filthy love at length
Of King Eurytus daughter made him thrall,
Whose Sire and Country be had erst atchiude:
Fled was his force, stint was his stately strength,
To spinne and card be thought no shame at all,
Nor of his Lions spoil to be depriude:
Which Deianeira bearing by report,
(His loving wife) sent to him in this sort.
Amid whose lines and letters that she wrought
Came news (a doleful thing to written here)
And tidings, that the Shirt the wife had sent
Alcydes bane, and spiteful spoil had brought,
The loving wife had slain her manly Feere,
Which she poor sielie woman never meant.
But to requite her husbands death with pain,
At point to hang her self thus began she plain.
The.ix. Epistle. Deianeira to Hercules.
QEchalia to be woonne
I joy to hear the fame:
It grieves me that the Victor should
have yielded to the same.
Report was brought of late
to Grecia that agrees
Full ill with any fact of thine
the tales we heard were these,
That whom not Juno could
nor dreadful travels foil,
The selfsame man had Iole made
in seruage yoke to toil.
Eurystheus would it so,
and Juno passing feign
Would learn that thou with such a crime
thy former facts would stain.
What? it was not thou I trow
that could not be conceyude
In one whole night? I think herein
my self to be deceyude.
More damage Venus does
than Juno erst to thee
This raysde thee up by spiteful hate,
she makes thee bend I see.
Behold the world by thee
that lives at quiet ease,
As wide as watrie Nereus gyrdes
the ground with frothie Seas.
The greater part of earth,
and all the floods as far
As both Apollos lodges reach
to thee indebted are.
The Skies thou have sustaynde
that shall thy carkas bear:
And Atlas help thee at a pinch
when thou too weary wear.
But what save open shame
by these thy facts is got?
If those thy valiant feats of arms
with bawdie rule thou blot?
Do men report that thou
(for Jove a worthy child)
In Cradle crasht two crawling Snakes?
in faith they are beguilde.
That Babe was better far
than is this bourly man:
Thou nothing makste an end so well
as thou thy deeds began.
Whom not a thousand beasts
nor Steneleus atchiude,
Nor Juno could for all her spite;
has crafty Cupid giude.
But for I am the wife
of Hercules, and he
My fatherlaw that guides the Skies
and lettes the thunder flee:
I am surmisde a happy Dame
and married well to be.
How ill unequal Steares
in painful Plough accord:
So ill a simple woman matched
with such a stately Lord.
No honor commes thereby
but burden and debate.
Who so wilt well be wedded, wed
with one of thine estate.
My husband is alack,
my spouse is absent aye:
A stranger better known to me,
he dreadful beasts does stay.
I in my desert home
do naught but wish afright,
And sore tormented least my spouse
be spoylde of foes in fight.
Amid the Serpents I
and greedy Lions paws,
And tusked Boares am tossed, in fear
I stand of gaping jaws:
Of Dogs, that with their teeth from bones
will rent thy flesh by flawes.
And me debowled beasts
and idle dreams of night,
With griesly pictures of the dead
do maken sore afright.
For fleeing fame I hunt
and rumors rashly spread:
By doubtful hope is fear exilde,
and hope by fear is fled.
Thy Mother is alack,
and grievously does grutch
That to have likte the mighty Jove
her destiny was such.
Amphitryon is away,
whom men surmisde to been
Thy Sire: and Hill the stripling eake
of us can not be seen.
Eurystheus that does forge
the cruel Iunos wrath
Is felt of us: endurde to long
the Goddess anger has.
But these are trifles, oh,
thou addest foreign love:
And each may be a Mother made
by thee that list to prove.
I spare to speak as now
of Auge whom ere while,
(Alcide) amid Parthenian vales
thou fowly did defile.
And thee (Astydame) I mind
of purpose to concile.
Ne means thy wife God wot
Teuthrancian trulles to name
(Of whom there scapte not one untouched)
to breed thy farther shame.
A recent crime there is
a foul ill fauourde jade,
That unto Lamus me of late
a Mother law has made.
Meander (that so often
in one self circle ronnes,
And eke rebounding waves again
upon his shoulders, shonnes)
Saw when about thy neck
there hoong a chain of gold:
That neck that thought the burden light
the Welkin to uphold.
What? did thou nothing shame
those brawned arms of thine
With Goldsmithes work, with glittring Gemmes
and owches brave to bine?
Even those self arms (I say)
the Lions life that rest:
Whose noble spoil for mantell serves
upon thy shoulder left?
What? did thou dare aloft
upon thy curled hear,
(For which a Popple fitter was)
a mytred Hat to wear?
Ne did thou blushe in guise
of Lydian Less to don
A silken Scarf, and Riband fine
thy bourly Waste upon?
Was Diomede forgot
that cruel Carle then?
That fatted up his trampling steades
with flesh of murthred men?
In such a nice attire
if Busyre thee had seen:
No doubt he would have scornde of thee
yconquerde so to been.
Let Antaeus loose for shame
these jewels from thy throat,
For fear he loath that thou the palm
in wrestling collars got.
It Is blasted that thou stoodste
of woman's threats in awe,
And eake amyd Meonyan Maids
the twisted twine did draw.
What? did thou nothing shame
that hand with Flare to foil,
That had long erst in valiant fight
ygot so many a spoil?
With thwacking thombs thou drawste
a very boysteous threede:
And to thy stately Maystresse yeeldste
a just accoumpt with dreede.
How often whilste thou sponne
with fingers nothing fine,
Amid thy crabbed crushing hands
has cracked the twisted twine?
And standing of the whip
in trembling fear, they say
That thou before thy Maystresse feet
in dreede of lashing lay.
And spoils ylaide a part
of gotten praise the price,
Thou toldste thy deeds that should been tho
concealde in any wise.
To wit, in cradle how
the crawling Snakes thou slew:
And rent their gaping ia was in two
and did their force subdue.
And how Tegaean Boar
in Erymanthus lies:
And with his weight does wrong the ground,
so monstrous is his sies.
Thou do not let to tell
of Diomedes hedde
Firt on his Thracian gate, his Steedes
with flesh of man that fed.
And of the triple beast
Geryon thou did boast:
That for his heirde the welthiest was
in all the Spanish coast.
And of the Hellish hounde,
that Cerberus was height
(Three headed Curre,) whose pate with locks
of Snakes was fowly freight.
The Serpent eke, whose wounds
reserude him from the death,
And gashing scotches given afresh
infeft with better breath.
And how Antaeus hoong
with broken jaws betwyne
Thy left side (an ylfauourde weight)
and shoulders right behyne.
Ne doste thou then conceal
how Centaurs thou did chase
(That double shaped were, and dars^
not trust their legs in place)
Athwart Thessalian craggie cliffes,
and made them run apaee.
And can thou cladde perdie
in Sidon soft array,
And woman's nyce attire, for shame
have any word to say?
Beside the Iardan Nymph
upon her shoulders thrue
Thine armor, and did conquer the^
that Monsters did subdue.
Go now, and proudly vaimt
thy noble deeds of fame:
A man thou should not been of right
she bett deserude the same.
Than whom so much thou art
inferior, how much more
Thou stronger were than such as thou
had slain with hand before.
She has atchiude the fame
of all thy former deeds:
To her, as to thy lawful heir
thy purchasde praise proceeds.
Oh, shame: the shagheard case
the Lions rybbes bereast,
Enuironde round a woman's corpse
and to her carkas cleast.
Tushe, thou art foul deceiude,
no Lions spoil it is,
But thine thou flewste the beast, and she
has conquerde thee ywis.
A woman bare thy darts
with venom rank that wear
And Hydras beastly blood imbrude,
in hand that scarce could bear
A Distaffe fraught with Flax:
thy knarrie clubbe she held,
And gazing in a shining Glass
thine Armor she beheld.
This brute I heard, but gave
no credit to the same,
But yet from ear some part of grief
unto my senses came.
But now before my face
the hateful Whore does ride:
Nor I the secret smart I feel
have farther power to hide.
Thou will not have her gone,
she passes through the street
A captive: whom of force we see,
not as a captive meet:
With tresses hanging down
declaring her estate,
And hidden face to show that Channes
has given her the Mate:
But brave in beaten Gold
she passes to and fro:
As thou ere this in Phrygia were
accustomed to go.
From stately seat she yeeldes
the people such a cheer,
As though Oechalia stood again
and eake her Father dear
Did live, and thou (Alcides) by
Eurytus conquerde weere.
Perhaps deuorcement made
twixt Deianeire and thee,
No more thy drabbe this hateful Whore
but wedded wife shall be.
Th'abodement makes me fear,
(...) cold my corse
Does (...) hand does lie
in bed withouten (...)
And me among the rest
as wife with honest zeal
Thou have pursude: I causde thee twice
with warlike tools to deal.
For Achelous up
his broken horns did take
With dreerie cheer that lay dispersed,
and hid in durtie Lake
His maimed front and erdwne yerackt
for Deianeiras sake.
The Monster Nessus with
thy deadly darte was slain,
And with his Horses gorie blood
the waters did distaine.
But whereto write I this?
for tidings now is brought,
The shirt I gave my husband has
his cruel death gwrought.
Aye me, what have I done?
what forste me this to fry?
O Deianeire, O cursed wench,
why do thou doubt to die?
And shall thy noble Feere
in Oeta Mount be rent?
And thou survive that were the cause
and wrought that foul intent?
What now remains to (...)
a perfect prouse (...)
Was H^cles wife? the truth therein
my doolefull death shall try.
Thou Meleager in me
thy sister shall descrie:
O Deianeire, O cursed wenche
why doste thou doubt to die?
O lynage of missehappe,
O hapless house I say:
My aged Sire Oeneus lives
at point of last decay.
Tydeus my brother is
a poor exiled Squire,
The the other fryde by Mothers means
alive in fatal fire.
My Dame upon her Corpse
the cruel sword did try:
O Deianeire, O cursed wench,
why doste thou doubt to die?
By geniall rights I crave
this only thing of thee
Not to surmise this wicked death
of purpose meant by me.
For Nessus stroke with Dart,
declarde me that his blood
Would forcen love, and said it was
for that exceeding good.
I sent a Shirt to thee
imbrude therewith to try:
O Deianeire, O cursed wench,
why doste thou doubt to die?
Now crooked Sire farewell,
and sister Gorge adue:
Thou Country with my brother exilde,
farewell I say to you.
And thou that art so like
to be the latter light
Mine eyes shall see: and Hercules
my spouse (O that thou might)
And little Hyl (my pretty boy)
I bid you all good night.
The Argument of the x. Epistle, entitled Ariadne to Theseus.
ANdrogeus by deceyte was done to death
And murthred by the men of Athens town:
King Minos warrde to wreake his less of breath,
And brought in fine his sturdie enmies down,
Scuen Maiden Babes, as many men by th'yeare
They yielded up to make his Monster cheer.
By lot they went, until they came at last
To Theseus, he into the doubtful den
(Clept Laberinth) to Minotaur was cast:
But ruthful Ariadne taught him then
How to destroy the Monster, and to pass
By tracke of twist from Prison where he was.
With Ariadne he, and Phaedra scapes,
Ariude at Naxus, Bacchus gave him charge
To leave the one of those his goodly rapes
(That Ariadne hight) and let her large.
When night was come, and she to slumber led,
With Phaedra he from Ariadne fled:
The Nymph (when sleepie nap was quite exilde,
And senses came to former force again,)
Seeing her self so shamefully beguilde,
In wretched wise with tears began to plain:
Requesting ruth, and platly making show
That he to her a better boon did owe.
The.x. Epistle. Ariadne to Theseus.
MOre friendly have I found
than thee the brutish kind:
A worser guard than thou have been
I deem I might not find.
Theseus: the lines thou vewste
from that self shore I wright:
From whence (forsaking me by mean
of sail) thou tookste thy flight.
Where me, my fleepe, and thou,
(a woeful wight) betrayde:
Thou (out alas) that chose thy stem
when I to sleep was laid.
It was the time when soil
with foggie Deaw was dight
But lately fallen: and shrouded Fowls
in shadie bushes shright.
Where I were waking then
or slumbring I wot nere:
But out I floong my fist to feel
where Theseus were there.
Was none such. Back I drew
my hand: and out again
I rousde mine arms about the bed,
but (oh) it was in vain.
The fear all sleep exilde,
I rose in ghastly dredde:
And from my wyddowish Couch I fell
and foul forsaken bed.
Forthwith with ruthlesse hands,
I struck my bared breast:
And rent my locks, that hoong (as I
abrayde from sleep) undressed,
The Moon gave light, I lookte
to vewe the country round:
But save the stronde, and stony rudge,
was nothing to be found,
Now hither, thither then
I ran and too and fro
I rangde, the Sand did lode my legs
I had much work to go.
Thus whilste about the shore
on Theseus name I cry:
The hollow rocks at erie call
and cleaping did reply.
How often I callde, the place
so often Theseus namde:
As though it would a woeful wight
her aid and succor framde.
There was a Mount, whereon
few trees aloft did grow:
Which now is wore a hanging rock
yfret with waves that flow.
Whereto I clambe, the heart
my limbs does strenthen so:
As round about the surging Seas
my wandering eyes I throw.
From thence (for tho the winds
on me did use their power)
I saw how with a Southren gale
thy strouting sails did scowre.
I saw it: or at least
for that I so surmisde,
More cold I woxe than yse, and deadly
pangues my heart surprisde.
Whom long to languish grief
would not permit as than:
Abrayde from trance, vpryste to call
on Theseus I began.
Why? whither fleest? (quoth I)
retire unthrifty wight:
Do turn thy Barck that lacks his load,
and is not thoroughly fright.
Look what my voice might not
my plangor did supply:
And with my words I meddled strokes,
each blow ensude a cry.
Put case thou did not hear:
yet might thou see it plain:
My hands displayde gave siker signs
and tokens of my pain.
Upon a pole I hoong
a flittering Kerchiffe white:
That might revoke to mind, that thou
had me forgotten quite.
At length I lost thy sight
then tears began flush apace:
My cheeks long erst were woxen wanne
and flecked was my face.
What should mine eyes have done
but waylde my woeful plight?
When that they saw they might no more
have Theseus ship in sight?
Or I with tresses then
depending sole did run,
Incited by the Ogigian God
as does the drousie Nun:
Or casting eye to Sea
did sit upon a stone,
My self as much a rock as was
the seat I sat upon.
Often times to bed that had
receiude us both I have:
The bed which could not yield again
the man that thence was past.
And as (I might) for thee
thy steps I did embrace:
And eke the couch not thoroughly cold
where thou thy corpse did place.
I lay me down, when tears
my deadly cheeks distaine:
And cry, reyeelde accoumpt of two
that have received twain.
Since hither both we came,
why part we not yfeare?
Thou traiterous couch, the chiefest part
make show where is it? where?
What might I do? or sole
why whither should I flee?
Within this I Will ne works of men
nor toils of Oxen be.
The Sea enuirons round
the Land on every side:
No shipman here, nor Hulck that dares
on perilous Sands to ride.
Put case I had both Mates
and winds with wisshed sail:
My Sire debarres me to return,
what shall the rest prevail?
Though in a blissful Barck
through calmed Seas I pass:
Though Aeole pease the winds, I shall
be banished naythelasse.
Not Crete, that fostred Jove
is leefull for to see:
Wherein of great renoumed fame
a hundredth Cities be.
For not alone the soil
where Minos bears the sway,
But eke my Father by my fact
I fowly did betray.
When least thou vanquished, should
in Laberinth have did,
I gave thee twiste thy skillesse foot
and twine thy steps to guide,
When thou me spakste (by these
my present perils I
Protest that thou shall aye be mine
till both of us do die.)
As yet we both do live
and I am not thy Make,
(If women may be said to live
whom periurde men forsake)
If with the Mace, that reft
my brother monsters breath,
Thou me had slain, thy Hest had been
accomplished by my death.
Not now to mind alone
my future happes I call,
Which must ensue: but such as to
forsaken wightes do fall.
Unto my troubled thought
a thousand kinds of death
Resort, which less would grieve my ghost,
than this my lingered breath.
Now fear I (...) Woolues
(...) that come:
With gnashing teeth, and ramping paws
my griefull guts to nooine.
Perhaps this savage soil
the Lion brown does breed:
Who wottes the ruthlesse Tygres where
this yrkesome isle does feed?
To that, the Seas are said
great Whales to cast on land:
And who (if I with sword were wrongde)
by me would friendly stand?
Oh let me not be bound
as Vassell caught in band:
Ne waste the day at turn and twist,
or card with captive hand:
That Minos have to Sire
and Pasiphae to Dame:
And (that I chiefly fix in thought)
thy pacted spouse that am.
When I survey the Seas,
the land, or stony fleate:
The ground does manace many things,
the waters eke do threate.
Then only skies were left
the forms of Gods I fear:
A pray in wild Desert forlorn
for hungry beasts to tear.
Though men po^ (...)
I give no trust at all:
For wronged once, the forraynes faith
into suspect I call.
O would Androgeus liude,
nor Athens bought so dear,
His doolefull death, by yielding such
a tribute by the year.
Ne thou with knottie Mace
had done to death the Beast
That was a man for upper parts,
a Bullock for the reast.
O that I ne had given
to thee the twisted Clewe,
Whereby the darcksome Den to escape,
when thou the Monster slew.
That thou art Victor aye
I nothing muse perdie:
Nor that thou madste the ugly Beast
of Creta so to die.
Thy steely heart could not
be pierst with hurtful horn:
Thy breast was guarded well, thereon
though were none armor borne.
Thou thither flints conueydst,
and Adamant did bear:
And that which slints does far surmount,
a Theseus had thou there.
O cruel sleeps, why did
you tho my limbs detain?
I should as then with ruthlesse death
but once for all been slain.
Ye winds were spiteful eke
and ready (oh) too soon:
Ye puffing blastes to force my tears
ye have your deuor done.
The hand was cruel that
my brother and me has slain:
And faith ygraunted me that was
a name requird in vain.
Sleep, wind, and gaged troth
did all at once conjure:
One silly Nymph by triple cause
was guild without recure.
Oh that my mothers tears
I dying shall not see:
Nor any for to close mine eyes
with friendly fist will be.
My hapless ghost to strange
and uncouth skies will fly:
No loving hand will noynt my limbs
and carcass when I die.
But for my bones vngraud
the Seafoule foul will strive:
A worthy Sepulture for one
that well deserud alive.
To Athens thou will pass,
where in the City when
Thou art receiude, and plast in pride
amids thy country men:
And shall declare the death
of double shaped beast:
And stony lodge to doubtful ways
that does so ofen wreast:
Display how me forlorn
thou leftst in Desert tho.
I naust not be forgot, ne seem
to spoil thy title so.
Not Aegeus was my fire,
nor Aethra gave the breast:
Of rocks and waves that thou were bred
may eastlie be gest.
From ship top would thou might
me miser Wight have viewde:
My grisly picture would have forced
thy stony heart to have rewde.
Now not with eye behold
but in thy mind suruay,
Me clinging to the deaten rock
which makes the waves to stay.
See how my locks do hang
in wailefull mourning mood:
Behold my clothes with tears as moist
as they were washed in flood.
My carkas quakes as corn
enforst with Borias might:
My trembling fist the letters marres
as I my lines do wright.
By no desert of mine
(for that it framde awrie)
I sue to thee: let not my factes
deserve such thanks perdie:
Ne griefull pains procure,
for though thy lively breath
I ne did save: yet have thou no
just cause to have my death.
These fainting fistes, with beating
of my breast a good,
I (woeful wretch) extend to thee
through ouerwandred flood.
These locks (which yet are lest)
in doolefull wise I show:
And by these tears I pray, which tears
thy facts enforce to flow:
(Good Theseu) turn thy ship
with wrested wind retoure:
Though ere thou come I die, yet of
the bones thou shall be sure.
The Argument of the xj. Epistle, entitled Canace to Machareus.
King Aeols Son Machareus, fell in love
With Canace beyond the bounds of kind,
To bed this beastly brood are gone to prove
Unlawful lusts delight, nature repinde:
She naythelesse fowly begot with Child
Was brought a bed, a sign she was defilde.
The Nurce conuayde the Babe, who at the door
Exclamde: The Grandsire heard the yelling sound,
And found the filthy fact: he made no more
Ado, but sent the Babe in blankets bound
Into the fields of Ravens to be rent,
Or hungry Dogs, or wandering Woolues he meant.
Beside, a sword to Canace he sendes,
By cursed death to end her beastly life:
To work her fathers will the wench intendes,
But ere she felt the force of fathers knife,
To Machareus (to Delphos that was gone
For succors sake) thus ganshe make her moan.
The.xj. Epistle. Canace to Machareus.
JF any blots do blind, or blurre my lines,
The murder of their Maistresse makes ye sann
My right hand holds the pen; the left a sword,
And in my careful lap the Paper lies.
Of Canace such is the griesly form,
Whilst to hit brother she deuisde to write:
For so I may suffice my wrathful Sire.
Oh, that himself were here a gazer on
His daughters death: Oh, that the Author saw
With present eye, the thing he gave in charge.
So ruthlesse he, and passing far in rage
His whirling Southren blastes, that he with dr^
And teareles cheeks, my gaping wounds would view
It Is much (in faith) with raging winds to live,
Unto his peoples kind his nature grees,
A Ruler fit for such a ruthlesse race.
He checks the Southren wind, and Zephyrus,
With Northren Aquilo he keeps a coil,
And ( Eurus eake) thy stubborn wings he rules.
He masters all the winds, not swelling wrath,
Unto his vice, his conquerde kingdom yeeldes.
What now auayles by Grandsires to the skies
Aduaunst to be? With Jove to be allyde?
If naythelesse in womanish hand I hold
Unsitting tools the sword, a scathfull gift?
(O Machareu) the day that us conioynde
After my death one hour should have be feign.
A brother why, more than a brother ought,
Imbrast thou me? and why to thee was I
More than a sister to her brother should?
Eke I was touched with love, and I wot nere
What God it was that set my heart in flame.
My color quite was fled, my carkas lean
And bare became, my mouth refusde to feed.
Full hard by sleep I came, each night a year
Did seem, I gronde, and had no hurt at all:
Ne could accoumpt my self why so I did,
Ne knew what love did mean, and yet did love.
My Nurse with aged mind, perceyude it first,
And said at first, I was with love attachte.
Whereat I blushed, and cast mine eyes to ground,
And whist, which tokens were of guilty mind.
At length my growing womb began to stroute,
And with his weight my weakened limbs oppressed.
But then, what herb or drench was to be found,
That she ne brought, and boldly did apply?
To fine (which only prancke thou never wiste)
My venture might of burden be releast,
That woxe so fast within my growing guts?
But (oh) the infant was so ripe, and stacke
So nere my ribs, as it was safe from scathe.
When Phoebus sister ninthly woxen was,
And tenth Moon began to chase her lightsome stedes:
I wist not what procurde my sudden throws,
A skillesse wight (God wotte) to bear a child.
No longer I from crying could refrain,
Or hold my peace. What will you so unfold
( Quoth Beldam Nurse) ye crime? and stopped my mouth.
What might I Miser do? grief forced me grunt,
But fear, and shame, and Beldam it forbode.
Then dolor I represt, and uttered words
Reuokte, and was enforst to drink my tears.
Death stood before my face, Lucina quite
Denyde to help: and death it self had been
A monstrous crime, if I as then had did.
When thou, with garments rent and foren lacks,
Relieved with thy breast my dying limbs,
And said. O sister live, live sister dear,
Ne in one corse destroy thou bodies twain.
Let hope reduce thy force, that brothers spouse
Shall be, and wife to him by whom thou art
A Mother made. In faith I was reuiude
At those thy cheerful words, that lay astraught,
And was releast of grief and gylt at once.
Why doste thou so rejoice? King Aeole sits
Amid his stately Hawle, my fathers eyes
Must never see this filthy fact of mine.
The busy careful Nurse with fillets fine
The Infant hid, and boughs of Olive white:
A sacrifice she faynde and prayde apace.
My Father and all the people gave her way,
And licenst her with feigned rites to pass.
When she to Thresholde came, the yelling cry
And clamor of the Babe the Father heard;
And so the sielie child it self bewrayde.
The Infant all inragde, Aeolus, raught,
And with his furious shrich the Palace fillde,
The falsed sacrifice revealing quite.
Even as the Sea does shake and trembling quappe,
When with a gentle gale it is enforst,
Or as the Ash with Southren wind does wagge
So might thou se my bloudlesse members shake,
Who lay as then ystraught upon my bed.
He rushing in, and with an open cry
Disclosde my fault, and from my Misers face
His ruthlesse hands with much a do withhelde.
I blushing, naught, save flushing tears ga^ shed,
With quaking fear my trebling tongue was tide.
He gave in charge the Babe, (his nephew) should
To Dogs and ravening foul in fields be floong.
The child exclamde, as though he had conceiude
The Grandsires mind, to whom he sude for ruth
With voice, as he the sielie Miser could,
What heart had I then (Brother) to your doom?
(You may my case conjecture by your own)
When fore my face into the desert grove,
My cruel foe, in hand my bowels hare,
Of Mountain Wolves to be in quarters torn?
But out at length he from my lodge diuerts.
Then beat I on my breast with balefull strokes,
And with despitous nails I rent my face.
Mean while with mournful cheer from Aeole comes
In message one, that thus bespake me tho.
Aeole (my Lord) to thee this sword has sent,
(And therewith took it me) and biddes thee know
By thy desert and merit what it means.
I wot, and will this sword with courage use,
Stabbing my Fathers gift into my breast.
O thou that gauste me life, with such rewards
My marriage do thou mind for to enrich?
O Father, shall thy Daughter thus be dowde?
Hymen deceyude, do way thy bridal brandes,
And flee this wicked lodge with troubled foot.
On me, ye swarth Erinnyes, fling the flames
You bear, therewith to make my burial blase.
O happy sisters, lincke with better luck
But aye my fact in mindful breast retain.
Alas, what has the sielie Babe deserude,
So lately brought to light and loathsome Skies?
What fact of his ye Grandsires wrath might stir?
Let him be thought to have deserude the same,
If so he could deserve. But (out alas)
His mothers guilt the Miser Infant byes.
O Son thy Mothers dole, the pray of beasts,
O thou the day of birth, thy Dame berest,
O child of hapless love, the piteous pledge,
This day thy first, and this shall be thy last.
Ne lawful was for me with yolded tears
To bath thy corpse: nor on thy grave to cast
My clipped locks, and tresses cut thereto.
Ne lay I on thy limbs, ne from thy mouth
The chillie kiss I caught and latter breath.
But greedy beasts my rapted bowels rent.
And I by lurching wound the infants ghost
And shadew will pursue: ne will be said
A Mother long, nor void of Babe to be.
But thou (whom all in vain, and all for naught
Thy wretched Sister hopt) the scattred benes
Collect in field of thy young Son and mine,
And bring them to their Dame, and place the^ there,
Let one self vrne our bodies both contain.
Remember me, and bath my Hearse with tears;
Ne fear the corpse of her that looude thee well,
I crave thee to fulfill thy sisters Hestes.
A Miser most of all: and I will seek
My cruel Fathers will to put in ure.
Thy dying wife and sister says adewe.
The Argument of the xij. Epistle, entitled Medea to Jason.
Jason in youthful years to Colchos came,
And with the Fleese be filcht away a Maid
Medea cleapt, and began his voyage frame
To Thessalie, where once arriude he stayde.
The feeble Aeson she reducde again
By solemn charm to lusty youthful age,
With fresher blood enstuffing erie ^aine.
She made him young to sight that erst was sage.
King Pelias daughters dear she did persuade
(A monstrous act) to kill their aged Sire,
In hope she would the Prince a princoxe made:
Which they poor sielie Maids did most desire.
With other fowler factes, which when she had
For Iasons love (as she reported) done,
He shook her off, which made Medea mad,
And causde her write these lines to Aesons Son:
She sigth, she sude, she sobde, she manast eke
To be reuengde upon the guilefull Greek.
The.xij. Epistle. Medea to Jason.
I Mind it yet how I of Colchos Queen
Aplide to thee, when you my succor craudste
That I by Art would guard thee from a^noy.
The sisters tho, ye mortal twist dispense,
There flaxen web should have vnfolden quite:
Then might I Medea well have lost my breath,
From that my lingered life is but a pain.
Aye me. Why ever forced with youthful arms
Came Iasons ship to fet the Phrygian Fleece?
At Colchos why Magnetian Arge arriude?
And Greekish route of Phasian flood did drink?
Why more than needed I thy golden locks
Did like? thy featurde shape, and glosing tongue?
If once (for that a foreign ship to shore
At Colchos came, and brought undaunted wightes
And dreadlesse men to land) Jason unawares,
Not Phisickt first, had run to breathed flames,
And poynant horns of fell and yrefull Bulls,
Or sown the seed and had as many foes,
And Tilman had of tillage so been slain:
How much disceite (unthrift) with thee had did?
And I of how much woe acquitted been?
It is some pleasure to unthankful wightes,
For to object the good forepassed tournes.
That I will use of thee, that only joy
And solace I will gain, thou faythlesse man.
Thou having charge at Colchos to arrive,
In uncouth Hulke my wealthfull kingdom, and
My Country camste unto, where I was then
The same that here thy novel spouse is deemde.
My father was as rich, as is her Sire.
He Ephyren with double Sea possessed,
In frostie Scythia the other gouernde all,
As far as Pontus lefter side does lie.
Oeta took the youthful Greeks to guestes,
With him, you men of Thessale did soiourne.
Then saw I thee, and began to know thy name:
That season brought my mind to ruin first.
I both did see and perished eke, inflamde
With fire unknown, and fride with strau^gie gleade,
As fore the Altars burns the torche of Pyne.
Both featurde well thou were, and fates me drue,
Thine eyes my dazeled lights did ravish quite:
Which quickly thou discridste. For who may well
Keep love in mewe, that no man it discern?
Aye flame it self by casting light, bewrayes.
Meanewhile ye king co^maunds, and gives in charge
The bulls with brawned necks to bring to yoke.
Mauors his bulls they were dreadful for horn,
Not sole, but breathing out a ghastly flash:
Whose houes were brass compact, their noses set
with gads of steel, which blak with breathing looked.
Moreover in open fields to cast the seed
Engendring men thou were commanded the,
Which would assail thee with their late borne darts,
A thancklesse crop for him that tilde the soil.
The waker Dragons eyes, that never slept
To guile, of all thy travels was the last.
Thus spoke Oetes, up in gastefull dreede
Ye rose each one, and from the Table start.
How far from thee was then Creusas dowre?
And reign in ioynture given? thy Fatherlaw
How far? and mighty Creons daughter dear?
Away thou wentst dismaide: with vapord eyes
Whom I pursude, and softly bid adewe.
As soon as wounded I to Cabin came
Where lay my couch: I spent the night in tears,
Before mine eyes the balefull Bullocks stood,
The cursed seed, the watchful Dragon eke:
Here fear and quiuering dreed, there love did stand,
The fear it self my love to more increast.
In dawning to my lodge my sister came,
Where me with toren tresse, and lying groufe
Upon my face, besprent with tears she found
She craude my help for men of Thessalie:
What she requirde, that I to Jason gave.
There stands a grove with Beech and houlme so black
As scarce Apollos rays may pierce the same:
There is in that (or tho at least there was)
Dianas Church, the Goddess standing there,
With barbarous hand yframde of massy gold.
Mind you? or is the place with me forgot?
Thither we came yfeare, with ruthlesse tongue
And guilefull mouth when you did bourd me thus.
To thee has fortune right and power assignde
Of life and dreadful death: within thy hand
(By her appointed lore) my state does stay.
Suffices power to spoil, if any take
Therein delight: but I reserude from scathe
Shall make thy former praise and glory grow,
And blast thy brute in Trumpe of endless fame.
By my sinister haps (which lies in thee
For to redress) and by thy noble race,
And Grandsire, that all mortal things surueyes:
And by the triple form of Dian, and
Her privy sacred rytes, this Country Gods,
(If any here within this soil do rain)
Rne on my Mates and me, O (Queen) I pray:
And oblige me unto thee by this boon.
And so a Gretian thou not seem to scorn,
(But how might I the Gods so friendly find?)
Sooner my soul to weightlesse air shall waste,
Than any (save your grace) with me be linckt
In spousall band, and bridely knot be tide.
Let Juno witness be, that has in charge
The marriage rites: that holy Goddess too
Within whose Marble Church we stooden now.
These, or the least of these, a siely Nymph
Might move to ruth: our hands were joined ek^
I saw thy trickling tears. Where part of guile
In them does lurcke? so I was quickly won,
And soon entrapt with thy dissembling tongue.
Thou broughtst to yoke the brazen footed Bulls
Unhurt of flame, and brakste the bidden soil
With pointed plough: whereon in steed of grain
The Serpe^ts teeth you floongst, whereof there sproong
A troop of Soldiers stern, with sword and shield:
That I (who gave thee ointment) stood in dreed,
To see the sudden brood with armor clad:
Till time the earthly brothers, twixt themselves
To civil combat fell, and fought yfeare,
A griesly sight, and woeful thing to tell.
Behold, the waker Serpent hissing came
With crackling scales, and with his bending breast
Did sweep ye soil. The^ where was dowre beco^e?
Then where thy Princely spouse? and Isthmos that
The double Sea deuides, and cuttes his course?
Even I, that now so barbarous am become
To thee, (a poor and hurtful person thought)
With forced sleep, the Serpents eyes did feed,
That safely thou might reave the golden Fleese.
My Father I betrayde, my native soil,
And kingdom I forsook: and got the gift
Which in exile a woman may attain.
My chastise was a wandering Rouers pray:
My sister and my loving Dame I left.
But thee (O brother) I ne left behind
At time of flight: my letter in this one
Place ginnes to faint, the thing my ve^trous hand
Did dare to do, it dares not to record:
So I (but even with thee) should have been rent
Yet dradde I not (for what should me appall
As then a woman, and a guilty wight)
My cursed corpse to surging Seas to gage?
Where are those gods? where those celestial states?
On us amid the goulfe deserved plagues
And torments send: on thee for thy deceyte,
On me for that I gave such credit light.
O that the ruthlesse rocks, Symphlegads, had
Our lymmes surprisde, and rent our bodies so
As might my bones unto thy carcass cloong:
Or cruel Scylla sent us to her whelps
And Dogs to been deuourde: for Scylla ought
Ungrateful wightes to plague, and pay with pain.
Charybdis eke that belks the swallowde waves,
O that it had under Sicilian surge
Our yrkesome corses cast, and whelmde in goulfe.
Safe thou, and Victor to Aemonia comste,
And to the Gods presentst the golden Fleese.
What should I Pelias daughters name, that did
Aguilt to pity mooude? who rent with hand
Their aged fathers bones? though other blame
Medea, yet thou haste cause to like her well,
For whom I have so often done amiss.
Thou did not shame (O that I words do wa^
To show my just complaint) thou did not shame
To say: from Aesons house dislodge in haste.
Commanded I departed, followde with
Mine infants two, and love of thee, that aye
Pursues my track, and follows where I go.
Unto mine ears as soon as Hymen came,
Carolde aloude, and kindeled Torches shone
With Bauen blase, and Shaulme began to sound
Ditties of love, joyful to thee, but more
Doolefull to me than is the Trumpets clang:
Afright I woxe, suspectyng no such ill,
Ne yet so foul offense: but naythelesse
Through all my breast the frostie cold did run.
A rout of people ran, and Hymen cryde,
Repeating often the same: how much the voice
More near approcht, the more increast my woe.
My servant sobde, and covertly did mourn
Who gladly would so great an evil report?
And me auayling more had been, what so
It were, not to have known. Yet sad and trist
I woxe, as though I had the truth discride.
When of my Boys the lesser, for desire
To see tofore the door at Wickat stood.
Oh Mother mine (quoth he) forgo the place,
With ioyly pomp my Father Jason commes,
And glittring twixt two chayned chyuals rydes.
I out of hand (my vesture rent abroad)
Did plague my breast with blows, with nails my face.
My mind persuaded me amids the throng
And thickest press to run, the garlands gay
From tresses smouthly trimde in rage to pull.
I hardely me withhelde from crying outs
(As I dissheuled was) it is mine: and scarce
From laying hands thereon I tho abstaynde.
O wronged Sire rejoice: ye men of Colche
Be glad: and of my Brothers ghost receive
Th'infests. My Country, house, and kingdom lost,
My spouse in steed of all that stood to me,
I reast refusde, and utterly forlorn.
Serpents I did subdue, and furious Bulls,
One man to daunt unable or to tame.
And I that raging fire by Art repelde,
Can by no skill my wasting flame eschew
Inchauntments, herbs, and soceries faylen now,
The Goddess naught, or mighty Hecate
Preuayles or helps Medea in needful time.
Not pleasant is to me the day, the nights
(That bitter are) I wake: no gentle sleep
Does daine to lodge in lamentable breast.
I, that my lymmes to flumber can not force,
Was able well the Dragons eyes to close.
Other my Arts, than me, do more avail.
The corpse that I preserude a strumpet straynes
With folded arms and of my pains has sruite.
And thou perhaps whilst to thy fonded spouse
Do brave, her ears desirous to content,
Against my face and manners new found crimes
Do forge. Well may she laugh at these defaults
Of mine: well let her laugh in stately seat
With purple Robe attire: the time will come
That she shall mourn, and weep again as fast,
And far surmount these hidden scorching flames.
Whylst iron, fire, or poison may be found,
No foe of Medeas shall vnwroken go.
If so by hap my prayers be of power
To touch thy steely heart, now lend an ear
To words that are inferior to my mind.
For I to thee in humble sort do sue,
To me as thou full often have done of yore,
Ne prone to lie before thy feet refuse.
If me thou set so light, yet have remorse
Of those our Babes, that common are to both.
A cruel stepdame will my children wrath,
And rigorously entreat in ruthlesse sort:
And they too much resemble thee, that are
Trapt by thy form, whose image moves me sort
And whom how often I see: so often my face
And moysted cheeks with tears are all bedewde.
By Gods I make request, by flaming light
My Grandsire gives, and by mine earned boon,
And by thy Babes (the pawnes of perfect love)
Reyeelde the bridely bed, for which I shonde
So many things: accomplish thy behest,
And do with aid thy Miser spouse relieve.
Against men, or Bulls, of thee no aid I crave,
Ne that thou should ye watchful Dragon drench,
And force him yield his daunted eyes to sleep:
But thee (that art mine own infeft) I crave,
That by thy fact have me a Mother made.
Demaundste thou for my dowre? in ye self field
(That was to ear for golden Fleese) it lay.
That very Fleese of gold, my ioynture was,
Which if I should reclaim, thou would debar
Thy self preserude my dowre: the Greekish youth
My ioynture was, therewith the wealth compare
Of Creons darling, judge the price of both.
That thou do live and art a wifebound man,
Linckt with a spouse, and have a Fatherlaw,)
And that thou can now show thy self unkind:
To me impute it, whence the guerdon came.
Whom I will out of hand. But to foretell
The pains what will avail? Ay swelling wrath
Is full of threats, disclosing secret thought.
Even whither ire shall lead, I will enfue.
And then perhaps he shall repent his deed,
As I lament, I gave a faythlesse man
Such credit, and beleeude the words he spoke
That god descerne the same, which stirrs my breast
I ne wot what greater thing my heart intendes.
The Argument of the xiij. Epistle, entitled Laodameia to Protesilaus.
WIth forty sail when Protesilaus went
To Troie ward, to fight for Helens rape,
The tempest so withstoode the Greeks intent,
As they from out port Aulide could not escape.
When flickring fame this brute had blasted wide,
His loving wife Laodameia wrought
Him thus, she shows her dreams, she wills beside
That he the Prophets words should print in thought.
Whose answer was, that who so leapte to land
First of the Greeks when they to Troie came,
Should die the death, it was bootelesse to withstand,
For why, the Gods appointed had the same.
He naythelesse for all his spouses words
(Coragious Lad) first leapte from ship to shore,
And for his pain, was done to death with sword,
As had the Oracle pronounst before,
This was the cause Laodameia pende
These lines, this made the wife this Pistle send.
The.xiij. Epistle. Laodameia to Protesilaus.
AEmonian Laodameia sends health,
And greeting to Protesilaus her sp^use:
And wishes it, where he soiourns to stay.
Report has spread in Aulide that you lie
In rode, by mean of fierce and froward gale.
Ah, when thou me forsookste, where was ye wind?
The^ broiling seas thine Oars should have wtstood,
That was a sitting time for wrathful waves.
More kisses with a greater charge, I would
Unto my spouse have given, and parled more.
But hedlong hence thou wentst, and wished wind
Of Seamen not of me, thy sails allurde:
That gale was meet for Mariners, unfit
For those that love. O spouse and Feere elect
Too soon I was thy clasping arms bereft.
Imperfect were the words, my foltring tongue
Pronounste, scarce could it speak and bid adue.
Then Boreas blewe and bore thy sails away,
And you (O spouse) were quickly hence conuayde.
It did me good (as long as lawful was)
To gase upon thy face, and with mine eyes
At parture to behold thy countenance.
When thou were out of sight, I saw thy sails,
Thy sails, that long my staring eyes detaind,
When neither thee at last nor sails I saw,
And naught save waltring waves was to be seen:
With thee my eyesight fled, and bloudlesse all
(With darkesome cloud beset) I fell to ground.
My fainting knees refuse to bear the corpse.
Whom Iphiclus my Fatherlawe, nor old
Acastus lod with years, ne Mother searce
With water cold, from swowning might reduce.
A charitable deed they wrought, to me
Gainelesse, I loath that I ne tho had did.
Even with remembrance, grief renude again,
And loyal love did gripe my chastefull breast.
No care had I as then my tresse to trim,
Ne yet with curious robes my limbs to wrappe.
As they with leauie thirse who^ Bacchus beats:
So to and fro, as fury forced I ran.
Phylacian Matrones came to me and cryde,
Laodamie, do on thy brauest weeds.
Shall I in purple Robe and Silks be clad,
And he wage war under the walls of Troie?
Shall I go kembe my tresse, and he an Helm
Upon his head sustain? fresh garments should
I wear, and he his clattring Armor welde?
As near as ever I may, thy trauelles I
Resemble will with doole: and during time
Thou art in siege, will lead a dismoll life.
Duke Paris, Priams Son (whose beauty bred
The scath of thine) I wish thou may as slow
An enmie be, as ill thou were a guest.
Oh that or thou disliked had the face
Of young Atrides spouse, or she thy port.
Thou Greek, that for thy rapted wife to great
A strife do stir, and overmuch do toil:
(Aye me) doolefull revenge to many will.
In future time, and wailefull wreake procure.
Ye Gods I pray from us th'abodement fell
Remove, and grant that my reuerted Feere
In temple may to Jove his armor yield.
But sore I dread, and look how often I mind
The lamentable war, and fearful fight,
Tears from my cheeks as thawed snow do tril.
I Would, Tenedos, Xanthus, and Ilion
With Symois, are gastely names to tell.
Ne would the guest presumde or been so bold
Away to have a Greekish Feme purloynde,
Unless he had by power and strength of hand
Been able to maintain, and bear it out.
His puissant force to him was not unknown.
He came reported, all betrapt with Gold,
And Trojan wealth upon his body bare:
With men and armoue storde, the aids of war.
And who with all his Country strength at once
And Princely power to foreign lands does go?
These Helen (I surmise) did thee attache,
And vanquished, which may the Greeks annoy.
Of Hector I adrad, I know not whom,
But Hector (by report of Paris) fightes
With bloody hand, and deals with deadly sword.
That Hector, that beware, what so he be,
If any love of me as yet be left,
His graued name in mindful breast ensculpe,
Him when thou have escapte avoid the reast:
And many Hectors there surmise to be.
And say (when thou art even at point to fight)
Laodamie my spouse did bid me spare.
If lawful be that Greeks shall conquer Troie
And Ilion by sorted lotte subdue:
Without thy wounds let it to ruin run.
Let Menelaus martch against his fors,
And Paris spoil of that which Paris reft.
Let him amid the press of enmies throunge,
And win in arms, whom he in cause subdues.
The husband ought the wife to rescue, yea
Though she were plaste amid a troop of fees.
Thy cause is far unlike, contend for life,
And harmless to escape, and only to
Thy Ladies lap in safety to retire.
Ye Dardanes, of so many spare me one,
Ne from his corpse enforce my blood to flush.
He is not one whom may be seem to fight.
Or to his martial foe his breast to gage.
He better may that fightes for hearty zeal,
Let others flash, let Protesilaus love.
Him I confess I would withhelde at home,
My tongue for fear of ill abodement stack.
When from thy fathers house to Troie ward
Thou wentst, thy foot at thresholde stumbled tho.
Which when I saw, in silence mourning said,
Grant Gods that this portende a good return.
Now do I this display, for thou in arms
Too ventrous should not be: procure that this
My fear to vain and vacant winds may turn.
And sort (I wot not whom) appointed has
To undeserved fate, that first of Greeks
With forward foot shall touch the Trojan soil.
O cursed Feme, that first shall wail the loss
Of her adempted fear. I crave the Gods
Thou show not then thy self excessive stout.
Of thousand ships let thine the latter be,
And last of all the sundred waves divide,
(And this for warning take) go last on land.
It Is not thy native soil thou flittest too,
At thy return let sail and Oar be plyde,
And haste thy Barck to thy well known shore.
Where Phoebus lurk, or else do shine aloft,
Both day and night thou breedste my griefull woe.
But most by might, for that a season is
To women (that with clinching arms im brace
Their lovers limbs) of sugared sport and joy.
For falsed sleeps I hunt in careful Couch,
Feeding on false delights, for want of true.
But why to me thy Image pale appears?
And from thy mouth why such complaint proceeds?
Enforst to watch, the yrkesome ghostes of night
And visions I adore: no Altar through
All Thessalie my fuming smoke does lack.
Incense I yield with intermedled tears,
Which mingde do surge as wine ycast in flame
When I with greedy arms, shall thee retourde
Embracing lie, and senseless ware for joy?
When lodgde with me in one self careless couch
Will thou the valiant factes of battle blase?
Which whilst you shall describe, though I to hear
Shall long, yet will we coll and kiss betwixt.
For kissing deckes the tale with better grace,
And stay procures ye tongue more prompt to parle.
But when I think of Troie, both wind and Seas
Return to mind: and hope by hoofull fear
Is vanquished clean, and put to sudden flight.
And that the winds your middle passage bar
Moves me. In spite of waves you mind to pass.
Who to his Country would with froward gale,
Against the will of winds shape his return?
And you from Greece in troublous tempest trudge.
Unto his town Neptunus bars your course.
Whither have you? each unto his home retire.
Why, whither go you Greeks? behold ye winds
And cou^terthwarting blasts. Some God procures
(Not soddain chance) no doubt, this lingering stay.
What save a shameful drabbe and harlot rank,
By this your war and battayles broyle is sought?
Whilst yet you may, and lawful is your sails
And flitting Barckes back to Achaia bend.
But why do I revoke? or call thee home?
Let all abodements go. I pray the winds
And calmed waves to further thine intent.
I spite at Trojan Dames, that shall suruay
The Funerals of their Feeres and waileful spoils,
Nor have their foes far from their country bounds.
The late betrothed spouse her self will d'on
Her husbands Helm and harness with her hand.
She will give armor, and whilste armor she
Does give (a grateful thing to both) will kiss,
And fellow forth her spouse, with charge to make
Retire, and say (to Jove thy weapons vow)
Reserving he his recent charge in mind,
Will warely fight, and cast an eye to home:
She at return will loose her spouses Helm,
And do his Targe away, his weary limbs
Relieuing with her aid as best she may.
We doubtful in suspense, and dread do stand,
Fearing each thing that may by fortune fall.
Yet whilste in foreign coast thou wagest war,
Of War that represents thy face, I have
A table made: to whom I tell my tale,
And kiss, as I thy corse was wont to coll.
The picture is more than it seems to sight.
In faith allow the waren form a sound.
And it will be Protesilaus out right:
That I behold, and in my husbands stead
Betwix my paps do place, and frame complaint
Thereto, as though it had the power to speak.
By thy return, and corpse (my saints I swear)
By egall lights of marriage and of mind:
And by thy head (which fright with silver locks
To fine that I may see: and that thou may
In health reuert) I swear, that whither thou
Shall give in charge, to thee I will repair
As fellowing Mate, whether thou live, or oh
That more I dread and stand oh more appald.
With this precept and only charge I end,
Respect thy self, and have remorse of me?
The Argument of the xiiij. Epistle, entitled Hypermnestra to Lyncius.
TO fifty daughters Danaus was Sire,
His brother Egypt had as many sons:
Whom be to match did earnestly desire,
With Danaus daughters: he the marriage shonnes,
And reason why: the Oracle had sed
His son in law should hewn off his bed.
Aegyptus wroth with this his brothers deed
(Of purpose that to Argos went his way
For cause the marriage should not so proceed)
Sent all his sons with Souldiars for to stay
Their Uncle: or his daughters at the least
To take to wives, and make a marriage feast.
The siedge was laid and Danaus in fine
Of force compellde for safties sake to yield
His brothers suit although he did repine:
When marriage day approcht, the father willde
His daughters to destroy with cruel knives
Their husbands, and to reaue their Nephews lives.
The day was come, each slew her slumbring Make,
Save Hypermnestra, that of all the rest
Spared her spouse, and warned him to take
His flight: such ruth did lodge in loving breast.
According to her counsel so he did,
And by that mean himself from danger rid.
In dawning when the father came, he saw
Each daughter had her sleepie husband slain,
Save Hypermnestra: whom withouten law
He sent to ward, in Prison her to pain,
Where being lodgde, these lines to Lynceus she
Deuisde and sent from Gyues releast to be.
The.xiiij. Epistle. Hypermnestra to Lynceus.
TO him that of so many brethren lives,
And sole suruiues, I Hypermnestra send:
The rest by their wives guilt were fowly slain.
I lode with Gives in Prison am detainde,
And not aguilting is my cause of scath.
For that my hand to murder not presumde,
I did offense: but so I had done evil
And ruthlesse been, I semblant praise had won.
More leffer I accoumpt guilt to sustain,
Than in such sort to please mine angry Sire.
Ne loath I hands of murder void to have.
Though me my Sire (who^ I ne wrongde at all)
With threatfull flame consumde, or manace with
The fire that present was at sacred rytes,
Or slay with sword which shamefully he gave,
And wife sustain the death her husband should:
Yet shall he not my dying jaws enforce
For to repent, or loath such friendly ruth.
Let Danaus, and my sisters for their fact
Agrise: This end such mischief aye ensues.
Recounting of that bloody night does make
My heart to quake, and sudden tremor force
My hand to stay from that I thought to write:
She whom they deemd could have her hus^d slain
Of murder not committed dreedes to write:
But yet I will assay. With mantle black
When yrkesome shade began ouerspreade the soil,
And failing day did yield to growing night:
We sisters led to Danaus Castle came,
And there Egypt his daughters intertainde,
Which privily were armde with wreakfull blades,
On every side the golden Lamps did shine,
And in unwilling flames the incense fumde.
The people Hymen cryde, but Hymen fled
The place, and Juno tho her town forewent.
When staggring they with wine, and fellows cry,
With garlandes fresh about their moysted locks,
To lodgings glad (their burial places) go,
And on their funeral beds their corpses cast.
With Wine and slumber now they laden lay,
And quiet rest throughout all Argos was,
When (to my seeming) round about I heard
Of dying men the grunts: which I in deed.
Did hear, and as I drad, it fell at last.
My blood was fled, the heat forsook my limbs
And in my novel Couch full could I lay.
As Zephyrus the flender Reeds does stir,
And winter air does shake the Popple tree:
Even so (or more) I quooke: astraught thou layst,
The wine I gave thee, was to forcen sleep.
My fathers charge all fear had quite exilde,
I rose, and took in trembling hand the sword.
(I tell but truth) thrice caught I up the tool,
And thrice from out my reaching fist it fell.
I naythelesse constrained by my Sires
Ruthlesse precept, and wailefull warning given,
Unto thy throat applide the threatening sword.
But fear and pity my attemptes withstoode:
My ruthful fist refusde my fathers charge.
Renting my purple robes and tresses down,
In whispring wise then thus I began to speak.
Thy father (Hypermnestra) cruel is
To thee, fulfill his Hest: a fellow let
Thy husband Lynceus to his brothers go.
Ah, I a maiden am by nature and
By age debonaire, ne my hand for war
And slaughter sitting is, unseemly fact.
But what? go to, and whilste occasion serves,
Thy valiant sisters sue: I deem by this
They all their Feeres have sent to Plutos Court.
Fie, if this hand could any murder done,
Unto my blood it should an issue given.
For bearing rule within their uncles reign,
They not deserved death, which naythelesse
To foreign sons in law should been assignde.
Put case the men had well deserude to die,
What have we misers done? or how aguilt?
What makes that I should not be ruthful aye?
Fie? what with cruel sword have I to do?
What should a Maid with warlike weapons deal?
My hands for turn and twist more fitter were.
Thus I, and whilste I plain, my tears ensude,
And from my face upon thy carcass fell.
Whilst me to colle, you threwst thy senseless arms
The sword well nie thine arms had recht a wou^d
At length of Sire, his servants and the day
Dreading: these words to break thy sleep, I spoke
Lynceus, that of thy brothers sole doste live,
This night (unless thou haste) will be thy last.
Thou startst affright, and sleep abandoned
In trembling fist thou sawste the cruel sword.
To thee that tho did long to know the cause,
Whilst night will give thee leave (flee, flee, quod I)
By night thou fledst, and I remainde behind.
Aurora rose, when Danaus began to count
And tell the corses of his murthred sons:
Thou only of the tale were found alack.
That of his nephews one had scapte the death,
He took in rage, complaining not enough
Bloodshed to be: such was his eger thyrst:
I from my fathers feet was taken straight,
And halde by the hair, to cruel prison thrust:
Of ruthful pity such the guerdon was.
Dame Iunos wrath has ever since endurde,
That Io of a Nimphe a Cow became
And from a Cow to Goddess was transformde
Alas, it was pain enough a sielie maid
To lowgh in fields, and not her Jove to please.
But lately made a Cow, her fathers banckes
She stood upon, and gazed in the flood
Upon the horns which erst were never hirs,
And minding for to speak she lowght a good,
Both of her form, and of her voice afraid.
Why Myser do thou flee? why musest at
Thy self in foorde, and numbrest so thy feet?
That art to other members now transmude?
Thou, whom Dame Juno had in great suspect,
With boughs, and sedge thy famine do expel.
Of flood thou drinkste, and gazest all aghast
Upon thy form, dreading the horns thou bearst,
And one, of late so rich as might accoye
The mighty Jove, lie bare upon the soil.
By Seas, by lands, and cousin floods thou runst,
Both sea and land, and lakes do give thee way,
Passage both sea and land, and Lakes allow.
What is thy cause of flight? why (Io) why
Ranglest thou so the largie Seas about?
Thine own countnance you may not well avoid.
Why (Io) whither fleest? the thing thou shoonsts
Thou followste aye, and doste by flight pursue:
Thou doste both lead and follow her that leads.
Nilus, to sea with seven fold stream yt flows,
Made her do way her brutishe shape at last.
What need I name the reast, that aged folk
Recite? my years occasion yield of plaint.
My Sire and Uncle war, we sisters we
Of Realm and reign exilde, are banished far,
He cruel both the Seat, and Scepter rules,
We needy rangle with our needful Sire.
Of brethren now the lesser part does live.
Whom I (as well the parties done to death
As Authors of the cruel fact) bewail.
For look how many brothers I am bereft
So many loving systers lost I eke.
For either part my doleful tears I shead.
Lo, I (cause thou doste live) sustain the smart.
What should I guilty bear? what torment bide,
That wrongful pain without desert endure?
I that was one of hundred allies erst,
One brother living Miser shall be flaine.
But thou (O Lynceus) if regard at all
Of ruthful Sister lodge within thy breast,
And worthy be, the friendship I have showde
Or aid me, or with death foredoe my corse.
And lay my limbs deuoide of life by stealth
In earth, my bones engraue with faithful tears,
And on my Tomb this slender title write.
A boon unfit for ruth,
in wrong exile the death
Bode Hypermnestra, cause she saude
her brother Linceus breath.
Much more in heart yet could I find to write,
Save that my hands ye clincking chains do lode,
And ghastly fear my wonted strength bereaues.
The Argument of the xv. Epistle, entitled Paris to Helen.
Sir Paris gone to Greece
fair Helena to coy,
In Lacedemon lands at length,
received like a Roy
At Menelaus house:
the Host to Creta goes
Atreus goods but lately dead,
in order to dispose.
Whose absence gave the guest
occasion to bewraye
His suit to Helen, whilst (goodman)
her husband was away.
He shows his secret love
and what good will he bears,
And to make breach into the Forte
the subtle Soldier swears.
He bragges of stately stock,
be vauntes of Princely kind:
He tells of Dardan dames of Troie
and more than was to find.
The Lady to allure,
his painted sheath he showde:
And in this wise his Pecocks plumes
the Trojan spread abroad.
The.xv. Epistle. Paris to Helen.
THis greeting Paris sendes
to Ledas daughter dear:
Whose helthfull state does whole depend
upon thy friendly cheer.
What? shall I speak? or needs
not this my flame be shown?
And more than I could wish to be
is love already known?
More leffer should it lurcke
(if I might have my will)
Till Fortune framde, as fear ne dread
my gladsome joys might spill.
But I to cloak by craft
my love not know the ways:
For who can hide the flanckring flame
that still it self betrays?
But if thou look that I
with word confirm the deed:
Take this as proof of hidden heart,
I fry with fervent gleede.
Let him that does confess
find at thy hand such grace:
In reading friendly all the reast,
as fittes thy featurde face.
It made me joy to hear
my Letters were receyude:
Whereof that he shall favor find
thy Paris has conceyude.
Which hope I wish to be
of force, nor thou for naught
Of me through ouerpassed seas
by Venus Hestes be sought.
For least thou witless ere,
I came unto this place
By warning of the Gods, and no
small God does aid my case.
Great matters I demand,
but not undue to me:
For Venus did compounde that I
should fast be linckt with thee.
By her conduct I from
Sigeian country came
In Phereclean Barck, and did
by seas my journey frame.
She gave me winds at will,
and weather safe to sail:
No marvel if she that was borne
of waves, on seas prevail.
Let her persist, and calm
the raging of my breast,
As erst she did the seas: and bring
my vows to harbors reast.
I brought with me this fire
I found not hers my flame:
Which was the cause that hither I
my voyage long did frame.
Not hither winters storms
or error me did drive,
At Tenaris was aye my mind
and purpose to ariue.
Surmise not me with wares
or marchaunts Mart to wend
Through fishfull floods: the wealth I have
immortal Gods defend.
Ne as a gaser I
to Graian Cities came:
For Trojan town (my native soil)
the Greece would lightly shame.
But thou, whom Venus erst
unto my bed behight,
Did cause me come, for whom I wished
or ere I knew the wight.
In mind I vewde thy face
before I saw with eye:
And brute by stickring fame at first
thy beauty did descrie.
And marvel is it none
if I as one that was
Ystroke a far with thirlings shafte,
in love my time do pass.
For so it pleased the^ Fates,
which least thou seek to break:
Lend ear to such undoubted truths
as I intend to speak.
When me within her womb
my mother did detain:
And that the weary poyse thereof
her strowting corpse did pain:
She seemde by Morpheus means
in dasled doubtful dream,
To have as then been brought a bed
with flaming fiery stream.
Afright with fear she rose,
and what she saw she told
The aged King, and he forthwith
consulted sages old.
Who preaching did pronounce
that Ilion should flame
With Paris fire, this ardent love
I feel, it was the same.
My form and forward heart
(though then I seemde but base)
Was proof and token that I came
of Noble haughty race.
A place there is in I Would
myd bushie laundes below,
Whereto no open way does lie,
but Pire and Houlme does grow:
Where neither simple sheep,
nor Mountain Goat did gnawe:
Nor lumpishe Ox with flapping lyppes
had filde his mownching mawe.
From thence the Dardane walls,
and buildings huge to see:
And waltring waves of drenching seas,
I leande against a tree.
With trampling feet me thought
the soil began to move:
(Though I displaye but truth, yet thou will scarce my tale approve.)
By force of flickring wings
was brought unto the place
Cylenus, ( Atlas Nephewe near,)
and stood tofore my face.
(As lawful it was to see,
be leefull to recite)
And in his hand a golden rod,
the God did hold upright.
And Heavenly Ladies three,
dame Venus, Juno and
The Princely Pallas, all at once
set footing on the sand.
I quooke for dread, my hair
stood staring on my head:
When (set thy fear aside) to me
the winged Herawide sed.
Thou art a Judge of forms,
stint all this godly war:
And tell which of these three by right
thy verdit does prefarre.
And least I should refuse,
from Jove he gave me charge:
And therewith flue with gate direct
into the Heavens large.
My strength began to grow,
and courage come anewe:
And then I drad not of the three
to take a perfect vewe.
All were surpassing wightes,
but yet I stood in dred,
(Assigned Judge) that erye one
might not alike be sped.
For one among the reast
surmounted other so:
As that it were the Nurce of love
thy self would lightly know.
Such carke they had to win,
as each one did intend,
By largess, and their goodly gifts
my doubtful doom to bend.
An Empire Juno gave,
dame Pallas virtues reign:
I doubtful stood where power or virtue
were the best of twain.
When sweetly Venus sinilde,
let gifts not move thy mind
(Quoth she) friend Paris: both repleate
with trouble thou shall find.
My only boon shall be,
that thou shall love, and have
The snow white Ledas dearling dear
and daughter passing brave.
She said, when justly scande
both forms and profers wear:
The last with prick and praise began
to mount up to her sphere.
Meanewhile (as froward fates
to better fortune grew)
By certain signs for Priams child
the Trojans Paris knew.
The son receyude, the house
long time was filde with joy:
And that self day continues still
as halowde yet in Troie.
And as I long for thee,
so maidens looude me well:
Thou only may their wish atchiue,
and bear away the bell.
Not Princes heirs alone
or dainty dames imbrast:
But seemly Nymphs in ardent love
with me were coupled fast.
But loathsome was their love,
I wayde them all aleeke.
When I of Helen stood in hope,
whom Venus willde me seek.
I waking with mine eye
did see thy face by day:
And in my heart I vewde thy form
when Phoebus fled away.
What will thou present do,
that in thine absence so
Did Paris please? I fryde though far
the fiery flame were tho.
Ne longer this my hope
I could defer at last,
But that my purpose to aspire
to Sea I went in have.
With Phrygian Axe were cut
the Trojan troes to ground:
And timber what so for the seas
most fittest then was found.
The haughty hills were spoylde
of great and woxen woods:
And Ida leant me many a tree,
with all their sturdie shrowds.
The Oaks for warped Keales
and rudder were ysquarde:
And with his crouked clinching ribs
the ship was well preparde.
We added Maste and top,
and hanging sails thereto:
And in the sides our painted Gods
were portred all aroe.
In ship wherein I went
was with her little boy
Dame Venus graven, whose behest
was causer of my joy.
When Navy was addressed,
and ready was the charge:
To pass upon Aegean seas
was given me in charge.
My parents by request
my voyage would have stayde:
And that I would soiourne with them,
as earnest suitors prayde.
My sister with her locks
(Cassandra) lolling down:
(When ships were ready to avale
from port within a stowne)
Why? whither ghost (quod she?)
thy freyghting shall be flame:
Thou little knowste what fire thou feast,
that doste this journey frame.
I find her words a troth,
I feel the foresaid heat:
And raging love in yielding breast
as kindled cole does freate.
With that I left the port,
by mean of blissful blast
And friendly gale: I did arrive
upon thy coast at last.
Thy husband took me guest,
with whom I harbourde thoe:
And not without the Gods advise
he practisde that I know.
Who made me show of all
that goodly was to vewe
In Lacedemon, or else where
in stately Greece he knew.
But naught might please my eye,
or hungry fancy leeke:
Who for thy passing praised shape
with longing heart did seek.
Whom when I saw, I musde,
mine inward parts I fealt
Surprisde with new unwonted cares
in monstrous wise to mealt.
A face resembling thine
(of troth I mind it well)
Had Venus, when to judge of hues
to Paris lot it fell.
If thou had there been pressed,
contending for the game:
I doubt where Lady Venus should
so lightly won the same.
Report has spread thy praise,
and Fame her trumpet blown:
So that in every country is
fair Helens beauty known.
In Trojan town is none,
nor from the rifing Sun
A famous Less, that for her hue
a semblaunt praise has won.
And if thou darste believe,
thy beauty does surpass:
And common rumor does impair
and breeds thy beauty less.
Here find I more than me
the Goddess had behight:
And all that glory by thy face
and form is passed quight.
Not Theseus looude for naught,
that knew so well thy shape:
That were of such a noble Duke
surmisde a seemly rape.
When by the Greekishe guise
a naked Nymph did sport
With naked wightes, in place of play
where Grecians did resort.
I praise him for his rape,
I muse he would forgo
So good a pray: with valiant heart
it should been healde you know.
For from these shoulders first
should fall my scotched skull:
Ere thee out of my griping hands
a mortal wight should pull.
Would ere these arms of mine
have let thee so depart?
Or during life mightste thou at all
from Paris clummes astart?
If needs I should forgone,
I would have had a share,
Nor all in Idle should have layne
the lustful Venus ware.
Or I thy maydenhead would
and dainty flower have gainde:
Or that which might have been allowde;
if maydenhead were restrainde.
To Paris plye, and thou
his constant heart shall try:
Who vows with thee in self same fire
and funeral flame to fry.
For I have thee preferrde
before the regal Mace,
Which welthfull Juno offered, when
I sat in Judges place.
And to thee fine I might
with arms thy neck enfolde:
I scornde the virtue Pallas gave,
more worth than glowing gold:
That time when Ladies three
appearde in stately I Would,
By dexter judgment there to have
their doubtful quarrel tried:
I sorrow not my choice,
ne yet repent at all^:
My stable mind does aye persist
as then it did, and shall.
This one request I make,
let not my hope be vain,
(O famous dame) that well deseruste
pursuit with endless pain.
No Rascal seeks to match
himself in Gentiles blood:
Ne thou to be my wedded spouse
may think thy self too good.
The Pleyade may thou find,
and Jove with stately style
To me alide, the middle Grandsires
though I should concile.
In Asia reigns my Sire,
(a fresh and fruitful soil)
Which scarcely may enuironde be
with long and painful toil.
Of Cities many one,
and lodges shall thou see:
And Temples such as fit for Gods
thy self wilt deem to be.
Great Walls with lofty towers
and Ilion shall thou bewe:
Which stately buildings by the sound
of Phoebus music grew.
What of the hugie press
of people should I tell?
The Country scarce contains the folk
that in the Cities dwell.
A troop of Trojan Dames,
and Matrones thee will meet:
The Phrygian Femes will stuff each Porch,
and every other street;
How often will thou say
Achaia is but power?
The wealth of Greekish towns is found
in every little bower,
Ne lawful is for me
thy Sparta to despise:
The place where thou were fostred, I
most blissful do surmise.
Yet Sparta is but spare,
more pomp thou do deserve:
So mean a soil for such a face
does nothing fitly serve.
Such beauty larger coast
would well beseem in deed:
And aye on new delights were meet
for such a face to feed.
When thus thou vewe our men
attirde, and bravely dight:
What will thou judge of Trojan trulls,
and of their vesture bright?
Now show thy self a friend,
nor of a Phrygian scorn
Thou dainty dame, in Therapnean
country that were borne.
For he a Phrygian was
and come of Trojan line:
That to the Gods their Nectar gives
commixt with water fine.
A Trojan Tython too,
and yet she likte him well,
That with the golden dawning does
the drowping night expel.
Anchifes was a Trojan
borne, and bred they say,
With whom the Dame of Love in I Would
in shrouding shaddowe lay.
Thy spouse with me comparde
(though thou thy self were judge)
For years and seemly shape would be
a Rascal and a Snudge.
I will not give to thee
a Fatherlawe, that by
His cursed fact did force the Son
his fearful steades to wry.
Ne Pelops was the Sire
of Priam, that with blood
Of Oenamus imbrude his hands,
and Mirtill drencht in flood.
Nor does our Grandsire gape
for fruit in flattring lake
Of Styx: nor seeks for waves in Well,
his growing thirst to slake.
But what avails this
if one be linckt with thee
Of their descent? Jove is enforst
this families head to be.
Fie shameful act, all night
that same unworthy patch
With thee does fleepe, and with his arms
thy sugared corpse does catch.
Thee scarcely I discrie
when table clothes are led:
And that self time with cark and care,
and sorrow enough is sped.
Unto my mortal foes
such banquets fall I crave:
As when that Bacchus comes to brood
I sielie Paris have.
I hate mine harbor sore,
when so the rustic lays
His arms upon thy snowish neck,
and with mine Hostess plays.
I swell with wrath (but what
should I now all declare?)
When with his clothes displaide the Chuffe
thy husband, hydes thy bare.
But when you began to kiss
and coll each other apace:
(For that I would not see) the cup
I set before my face.
Look when he thee imbraste,
to ground mine eyes I threw:
And in unwilling mouth my meat,
and yrkesome prawnder grew.
And grunting often with grief,
I saw full well when thou
At those my woes in wanton wife
would smile with laughing brow.
With wine often times I would
that fuming flame suppressed:
But drunkenness was flame in fire
and thus my heat increast.
And sundry sights to shun,
away my head I turn:
But thou estsoones would make mine eyes
and fancy to return.
Thus doubtful what to do,
agriefe these things to see:
But yet a greater grief away
from such a face to he.
As much as lay in me
this rage I strive to hide:
Yet naythelesse dissembled love
is quickly to be spide.
Ne art thou ought deceiude,
to thee my wounds be known:
And would to God that of my griefs
thou privy were alone.
How often when tears began flush,
turnde I my head awrie?
Least he the cause of mournful mood
should fortune to discrie?
How often with cup crasde
have I some love expressed?
And would unto thy featurde face
each word and sentence wrest?
And of my self in close
and feigned name made show:
Even I am he that looude so well,
if thou the same not know.
And that I franckly might
use wanton words at will:
I would make wise of Bacchus wares
as though I had my fill.
Thy breast (I well record)
(thy vesture being lose.)
Displayde unto my staring eyes,
thy beauty did disclose.
Thy breast than Mountain snow
or morning Milk more clear,
Or Jove that in the forine of Swanne
to Leda did appear
Whilst at the sight I gazde
(I held a Cup by hap)
And from my fist the Cup it fell
and in the floor did snappe.
When thou thy daughter kissed,
I would, the kiss to win,
Hermions cheeks and cherrie lips
eftsoone to smack begin.
Sometime laid bolte upright
of former love would sing:
And other sithes by beck would give
a sign of secret thing.
The chief of all thy Mates
I bourded but of late:
To Clymen, and to Aethra I
in humble wise did prate.
Who aunswerd nothing else
but that they stood in dread:
And even amid my earnest suit
away from me they flead.
Would thou were plaste as price
at some notorious watch,
That he who best in arms deserude,
thee for his Feere might catch.
Then as Hippomenes wanne
Atlanta in the field,
To whom a flock of suitors erst
in running race did yield:
As Hercules the horns
of Achelous broke,
When Deianeiras love to fight
the Champion did provoke?
I would my valiant prowess
in semblant sort have shown:
And that thy beauty causde the same
to thee it should be known.
Now naught remains, but even
to sue to thee (fair Dame)
And groufe to fore thy feet to fall
if thou permit the fame.
O flower, and present prayfe
of both thy brothers hyre:
O worthy wife for mighty Jove
if Jove were not thy Sire:
Or to Sigeian port
with thee I will retire:
Or in exile at Tenaris:
my carcass shall expire.
For why, no slender darte
has clest my breast in twain,
The mortal wound has broosde the bones,
and ransackt every vain.
In this (I mind it well)
Cassandra spoke aright:
Who said in future time on m^
a heavenly shaft should light.
Wherefore, do not despise
the love allowde by fate:
So may thou have the gastely Gods
thy friends in needful state.
I have a thousand things
which franckly to recite,
Receive me to thy careless Couch
in fere and silent night.
What? do thou shame, or stand
in such a bashful dred,
For to defile with secret escape
thy chaste and bridely bed?
Too simple sure thou art,
a rustic might I say?
Think thou that so well formde a face
from guilt may escape away?
Or thou must change thy hue,
or not be hard at least:
Twixt beauty and an honest life
was never war infeast.
For Jove delights in stealthes,
and Venus loves the same:
Ne Jove had been thy Sire unless
had Leda likte the game.
If griefs of love have force
scarce chaste thou may be thought:
Whom lustful Jove and Leda light
into this world brought.
Then lead an honest life,
when we in Troie shall be:
Let none be able to defame
fair Helen, but by me.
Now let us forge the fact
which marriage shall amend:
If Lady Venus words be true
as tho she did pretend.
Thy husband not in words
but deeds persuades thereto:
Who, for he would no hindrance be,
deuisde from Greece to go.
He had no fitter time
to ride from home but than:
O Lord it is a world to see
the subtle craft of man.
Mine Host is gone, who said
at parture: wife I will
Thou take in charge my Trojan guest*
thy husbands Hestes fulfill.
I swear, thou do neglect
thy absent Feeres request:
For why, thou have no carke at all
to entertain thy guest.
What do thou think in deed
that doltish sielie man,
The thewes of Helens passing form
may judge, or thoroughly scan?
In faith thou art beguilde:
for if the good he owes
He knew, therewith he would not trust,
a guest he scarcely knows.
Though neither thee my voice
nor friendship may procure
To yield me grace: convenient time
may cause us to play sure.
Or else we are but Doltes,
and more than he to blame:
If such occasion we permit
to flide deuoyde of game.
In manner with his hand
he gave his guest to thee:
See thou do use such simpleness
that has such care of me:
The long and loathsome night
thou lodgest all alone:
And I poor Paris to redress
my hapless harms have none.
Let intermedled joys
conioyne us both yfeare:
And that self night shall seem to us
than brightest day more clear.
Then will I make my vow,
appealing Gods to oath:
And by a sacred band to thee
for pawn engage my troth.
And then (unless the trust
I in my self repose
Be vain) I unto thee estsoones
my Scepter will disclose.
But if thou shame, and dread
to condescend thereto:
I only will sustain the guilt
and thou exempt shall go.
For why, thy brothers fact,
and Theseus will I take
As myrrours: nearer proof than this
I know thou can not make.
The Theseus erst, they two
Leucippids have bereft:
And I as fourth example made
and mirror shall be left.
My Navy is at hand,
of men and armor store:
We shall to Troie flit in haste
by mean of wind and Ore.
Thou like a stately Queen
through Dardan streates shall ride:
The Commons will some Goddess new
surmise to have espide.
What way soever thou go,
the perfumes they shall sweat:
And slaughtred beasts the gorie ground
with bloody strokes shall beat.
My sisters with my dame,
my brothers with the King,
And all the Trojan Matrons shall
their ample presents bring.
Oh, scarce one parcel I
of future things recite:
Thou shall have more than in these lines
my feeble pen can write.
Ne do thou rapted stand
of dreadful war in awe:
Ne fear that grudging Greece her force
to wreake this rape will draw.
Though sundry were conuaide,
was never none pursude
With clattring arms: of troth this dread
us causeless does delude.
In Boreas name the men
of Thrace Orithia stole:
Yet Byston had no hateful wars,
nor enmies to control.
In novel Barcke was brought
by Jason through the Seas
Medea: Colchos kept no coil
ne Thessale did disease.
And he that stale the first
reft Minos dearling dear:
And yet his men of Creta did
not once in armor steare.
The fear in these affairs
the danger does excel:
But afterward of fear we shame
when every thing is well.
Put case, that war were wagde?
(if so thou list to think)
What, I have men, and armor eake
yea such as will not shrincke.
And Asia is no less,
than is your country wide:
Of valiant wightes we have good store,
and startling steades to ride.
Nor Menelaus shall
of greater courage be
Than Trojan Paris, nor in arms
more stiff and stout than he.
For being yet a child
I slew my haughty foes
That stale my heirde: and of that fact
my valiant name arose.
And being but a Ladde
in sundry combats wanne
The palm from Illioneus, and eake
Deiphobus the man.
And least thou sole surmise
me to prevail at hand:
I can enforce my thirled shaft
full near the mark to stand.
The like attempt in youth
Atrides never made:
Ne Menelaus may thou match
with Paris for his trade.
Though all things else thou grant,
yet Hector can not be
His brother, which will stand in stead
of thousand men to me.
Thou little knowste my power,
my force from thee is locked:
Thou can not tell what man is he
with whom thou shall be shockt.
Or with no tumult thou
shall be requirde again:
Or Greekish tents to Paris Mart
to yield they shall be feign.
Yet need I not disdain
to war for such a wife:
For why, the price does well deserve
to stir a greater strife.
And thou, if all the world
for thee should seem to strive:
Shall stand assurde in after time
for aye to be alive.
Wherefore has dreadlesse hope
departing from this shore,
And blissful Gods, demand the gifts
I thee behight before.
The Argument of the xvj. Epistle, entitled Helen to Paris.
WHen Helen had the Trojan writ perusde
She thought her self too shamefully abusde.
She deemde it not the part of any guest,
To whoredom so his Hostess mind to wrest.
To quail the Princockes pride, and make a prouse
Of spotless fame, at first she stands aloufe.
At length when to and fro she had discourste
Of this and that, and color well disbourste:
She fawnes, she frowns, she freates, she speaks him fair,
She offered hope, but fed him with despair,
As women wont, devising many a toie,
But Paris her in fine conuayde to Troie.
The.xvj. Epistle. Helen to Paris.
HOw since thy letters have
thus rashly wrongde my sight:
I thought it needful with my pen
thy Pistle to requite.
And did thou dare a guest,
(the bounds of hostage broke?)
And honest Matron well espousde,
to pleasure to provoke?
For this by whisking winds
ytost on wauing Seas,
Did Taenaris thee with port relieve
thy painful plight to ease?
Nor (though inguestred thou
camste from a Country far)
My Palace did against thee as then
his churlish gates debar?
That such a wrong should be
reward for good desert?
Thou that did enter so have playde
no guestes, but enmies part.
Though lawful be my plaint,
yet doubt I not at all,
But thou (when so thou hear thereof)
a rude complaint wilt call.
A rustic let me be,
so I not pass the bound
Of honest shame, and in my life
no cankred crime be found.
So I in feigned look
do cloak no churlish cheer:
Nor in my face no grimme disdain
nor bended broowe appear.
Yet honest is my fame,
I live deuoide of spot:
No lustful Lecher for his life
is able me to blot.
Which makes me muse the more
what should enbolde thee so,
To take this strange attempt in hand
a married wife to wowe?
Cause Theseus wrongde me once,
well worthy am I deemde
To be a Ruffians rape again,
and so to be esteemde?
The guilt was mine if I
allured were to ill:
But so I rapted were by force,
what could I do but nill?
Ne he by that his fact
his hoped booty got:
Set fear and woman's dread aside,
I naught abode God wot.
The wretch by wrestling won
at Helens hand a kiss:
And laid her on the lips sometime,
he had no more but this.
Scarce would you been content
(unthrifty so you arre)
With that: I thank the Gods, that he
and thou did differ far.
He yielded me again
and me did scarcely touch:
And did repent him of his fact,
his modesty was such.
Did Theseus so recant
that Paris should succeed?
For fear least on my blased arms.
the people should not feed?
Yet I am nothing wroth,
(for who can angry be
With that she loves?) if this my love
be faithful unto me.
For thereof doubt I sore,
not for distrust at all,
Or that my face and featurde form
into suspect I call.
But for such light belief
and credit works our woe:
And suitors tales art freight with fraud,
and fired faith forgo.
But others do aguilt,
an honest Matron rare:
Who bars that I among those few
should have a party share?
For cause my mother errde,
perhaps thou thinkste me light
By her example to be won,
by mean of natures might.
To cloak my mothers crime
an error is in store:
For why the Lecher lurckt in plume
to work his will the more.
If I should do amiss
of force thereof I know:
There is no error mine offense
to hide from open show.
Her escape is well allowde,
the Aucthor made it less:
There is no Jove at all to cloak
my fault if I transgress.
Thou braust upon thy stock,
thy Grandsires Princes are:
This house of worthy Auncesters
and Nobles is not bare.
I will conceal that Jove
was Atreus Grandsire great:
Of Tantalus, or Pelops I,
nor Tyndaris mind to treat.
But Leda lendes me Jove
my stately Sire to be:
Whom foul beguilde with swannish form
and falsed bird we see.
Now vaunt thy Trojan heads
and ginners of thy race:
Let Laomedon be in press
and Priam eke in place.
Whom I commend: but he
that fifth is of your line,
(Thy greatest pride) I find the same
the foremost man in mine.
Though Trojan Scepter I
accoumpt to be of fame,
Yet judge I not our Empire ought
inferior to the same.
Suppose our wealth you pass,
and Teucrian troop excel
Our Greekish soil: yet barbarous is
the country where you dwell.
So great rewards your lines
and Letters me behight,
As well they might accoy, and cause
to yield a heavenly wight.
But so I minded were
to break the bounds of shame:
Thy self should sooner make me yield
than all thy gifts of fame.
Or I for aye will live
and lead unspotted life,
Or thee more rather would ensue
than all thine offers rife:
As I not scorn the same,
in price so are they thought
The greatest gifts to whom the giver
has their beauty brought.
But most of all I weigh
thy love, that for my sake
Such pains abodste, whose hope to pass
the Seas did undertake.
And eke at tables set
(though with dissembling browe
I seek to hide thine amorous tricks)
I note them well ynowe.
Sometime thou (wanton wight)
doste cast a glauncing blinck
With wrested look, whereat well near
my daunted eyes do shrinck.
Again you sigh as fast,
another time you take
The Cup, and where I dranck even there
your falsed thirst does flake.
With fingers (Lord) how often,
and with a talking browe,
Have thou me given secret signs
I wot well where, and how?
And often I stood in fear
my husband saw the same:
And often dreading to be spide
I blushed with bashefull shame.
Often times with whispring words
unto my self I sedde:
(This is a shameless guest) my words
did hit the nail on hedde.
And often wrought in wine,
I rad upon the boorde,
Even under Helens name (I love)
I well record the word.
But that I had distrust
thereof, my looks did show:
But now (alas) to write the like
does hapless Helen know.
These fancies might have forced
my ruthful breast to bend,
And tournde my heart, if to aguilt
I would at all intend.
Thy feature I confess
is rare, and such to see,
As might allure a woman's heart
to linck her self with thee.
I wish that hap to fall
upon some single dame:
Ere I with foreign love should seek
my bridely Bed to shame.
Well liked things to lack
by my example leare:
It is a virtue to abstain
from what thou have so dear.
How many youths have wished
for that which thou doste crave?
What? Paris do thou deem, that thou
alone good judgment have?
Thou see no more than they,
but madder is thy mind:
Thy courage is no bett than theirs,
less shame in thee I find.
Would then thou had repayrde,
and hither come by floode:
When me in prime and flowring years
a thousand suitors wood.
Of thousand thou the first
if I thee tho had seen,
(My doom to hear withal I crave
my husband) thou had been.
To things possessed thou comste,
and gotten goods too late:
Too slow thou were, another has
in that thou crauste, estate.
As then thy Trojan wife,
I would have wished to be:
So now Atrides not against
my will enjoys me.
Eease thou with words therefore
to ransacke Helens heart,
To her (thou fayst thou loouste so well)
procure no grutching smart.
But let me keep the sort
that Fortune has allowde:
Seek not my fame and good report
to dark with shadie cloud.
But Venus so behight,
and in the vales of I Would
Three heavenly Wightes stark naked came
to claim their beauties pride.
Of whom one gave thee reign,
the other Bellonas skill:
The third pronounst that Helen should
be plyant to thy will.
In faith I scarcely think
such Ladies would vouchsaue,
For chiefest beauties peerless price
thy doubtful doom to have.
Suppose it were a troth,
the reast was all untrue:
That for such judgment I should be
a recompense to you.
I stand not so much on
my beauties pride, to deem
That me the greatest gift of all
the Goddess did esteem.
My feature is content
of men to purchase fame:
I like it not that Venus should
so much commend the same.
But nothing I deny
the praise full well I leeke:
For to what end should I gainesay
the thing I chiefly seek?
Ne let it wrath thee that
I hardely thee believe:
To matters of importance great
we scarcely credit geeue.
Wherefore I joy it most
that Venus likte me so:
And next for such a stately gift
that thou did take me tho.
And that thou did prefer
my blased beauties good
Fore Pallas gift, and Iunos reign
that there in judgment stood.
Then I thy virtue am,
then I to thee a reign:
I were too stony if I would
not love the like again.
Good faith, I am no steel,
but him to love I shonne
Who scarce (I think) may be my spouse
when all my work is done.
Why should I fondely seek
to plough the barraine sand?
Or hope on that which place it self
does very much withstand?
I skillesse am in scapes,
the Gods record I call
I never by deceitefull slight
beguilde my Feere at all.
In that to covert scrole
my words I now commit,
My letters do attempt a thing
they never practisde yet.
Thrice blessed that are inurde,
I wot not how to play
That part as yet, to guilt full hard
I do surmise the way.
This dread does much annoy
and sore I am aghast,
Suspecting all the peoples eyes
on us are fixed fast.
Nor this I fear in vain,
the bussing brute I know:
And Aethra, what report had gone,
to me but late did show.
Unless thou mind to cease,
dissemble thou therefore:
But why should thou now stint thy suit?
thou can dissemble sore.
In secret use thy toys,
and spare thou not to play:
Now scope we have, though not the most,
my husband is away.
He now is far from home
affairs compellde him so:
A just and good occasion he
had out of town to go.
When in a doubt he stood
his journey forth to take,
Dispatch (quod I) good sir, and see
a quick return you make.
Th'abodement likte him so;
as he to kissing fell:
And gave me charge of house and goods,
and bad me use thee well.
I scarce my laughter held,
which whilste I strive to stay:
Save that it should be so in deed,
I had no word to say.
To Crete he went in have
by help of wind and Ore:
But thou, that all things leefull are,
must not surmise therefore.
So is my spouse alack,
as in his absence well
He does me guard: that Princes have
long reach can thou not tell?
Fame does impair our joys
for how much more you leeke
And praise me: So much more you cause
to stand in fear the Greek.
The laud I love so well
(as now consistes the case)
Annoyes: more better were that fame
had never blazed my face.
That I am left with thee
now he is far away
Muse not: he trustes my manners well
and thinks in me some stay.
My face did make him dread,
he trustes my life full well:
The surety which my manners breed,
my beauty does expel.
Thou willste me to be wise
and use the present tide:
And not to let so fit a time
deuoyde of game to slide.
I would, and am afraid
as yet my heart does quake:
And fearful breast in doubt does stand,
and knows not which to take.
My spouse does now dislodge,
and thou alone do lie:
Thy beauty likes me well, and Helens
shape contents thine eye.
The nights are passing long,
and we to chatte begin:
And thou art even a pleasant guest
and both one house within.
Good sooth each thing does seem
this fact to further aye:
And yet I know not how the same
my quiuering fear does stay.
As thou perswadste but ill,
would well thou might constrain
Me to thy will, this rudeness then
should be expelde amain.
Sometime received wrong
auailes the pacient much:
How blessed were I, such force to bide
if Helens hap were such?
More better were while love
is raw and green, to stay:
For flame that scarcely kindled is
will soon consume away:
Few drops of sprinkled water will
the sparckling fire delay.
As strangers starters are
uncertain be their loves:
And when thou think them surtte of all
their wavering faith remoues.
Let Hypsiphyl record
and Mynos daughter try:
For they them selves with wandering wightes
in bridely band did tie.
And thou of whom Oenon
was many years imbrast,
Art said without a just desert
to shonne the Nymph at last,
Which thou do not deny;
and very troth to tell,
My chiefest care was to enquire
where thou did use thee well.
And though thou would full feign
be stable now in love,
Thou can not, for thy Teucrian ships
will out of hand remove.
While we do tale yfeare,
and fixed night shall be,
The wind will serve thy sails so well
as thou will part from me.
Amid his pleasant course,
that unacquainted play
Will stint, and with the whisking winds
our friendship pass away.
Shall I (as thou perswadste)
go vewe the Trojan town?
Or unto great Laomedon
a Daughterlaw be fowne?
Perdie I more accoumpt
of swift and flickring fame,
Than that in every land it should
have power to spread my name:
What Sparta might of me
and all Achaia speak?
What ancient Asias famous towns,
and Priams mansion eake?
What Priamus of me,
and Priams wife might say?
Thy brothers, with the Trojan dames
what might they blast I pray?
And last, how might thou hope
me faithful spouse to find?
Thy own example would procure
distrust within thy mind.
What guest soever shall
to Ilion repeare,
Will breed suspect within thy breast,
and make thee stand in fear.
How often will thou inragde
term me by harlots name,
Forgetful that thy own offense
was causer of the same?
Thy self wilt both procure
and blame the fact at last:
Ere that I wish in hollow vaute
my carcass to be plast.
But I shall have the wealth
of Trose, and brave array:
And mo rewards than promise was,
thus did thy Pistle say.
Of precious Purple I
and Arrasse store shall have:
And be enricht with hugie heaps
of massy gold so brave.
Forgive that I confess,
I way not all the gold:
I wot not how this soil does seem
thy Helen to withholde.
For if I wronged were,
in Troie no succor is:
My brothers aid I stand assurde,
and fathers help to miss.
False Jason every thing
to Medea behight:
And yet in fine from Aesons lodge
she was expelled quight.
And being so refusde,
she could not make return
To Aetes, Ipsea, nor with Chalciope
for shame soiourne.
I nothing dread the like,
no more did Medea tho:
But sundry times abodements do
good hope delude, we know.
The ships that now in surge
and yrefull seas do ride:
When first they wayd their Ankcors, had
a calm and pleasant tide.
The brande does breed my dread,
wherewith thy Dame was sed
Before her wonted time of birth,
to have been brought abed.
The Soothsayers sawes I fear,
which spoke the time would be,
When men of Troie within their walls
the Greekish flame should see.
As Venus friends thee, for
she wanne the glittring fruit,
And foylde the other two that were
her riuals in the suit:
So dread I their disdaynes
which (by thine own report)
In judgment were so put a back
in such reproachful sort.
And if I follow thee,
I doubt it not (alas)
But that through swords and wreakefull blades
our hapless love shall pass.
With Centaurs to discord,
and bloody wars to wage
Did Hippodamia cause the men
of Thrace in yrefull rage:
And do thou deem my Feere
will unrevenged go
In quarrel just? my brothers both
and Tindaris also?
For that in bravery you
your Martial deeds recite:
The truth is thus, that from your words
your feature differs quite.
For Venus fitter thou
than Mars do seem to be:
Love Paris, and let men of force
go fight in field for thee.
Let Hector, whom thou so
do vaunt, in armor broyle:
Another kind of warrefare is
far better for thy toil.
If I were in my wits,
or somewhat bolder were
I would use these: the woman that
are wise will use this gear.
And laying shame aside
perhaps hereafter I
Will condescend, and conquerde with
continuance will apply.
For that in secret thou
do long the rest to tell,
The covert talk that thou would use,
I know it passing well.
Too hasty sure thou art,
thy harvest is in grass:
Perhaps this tariance will the better
bring thy will to pass.
Thus ye my letters leave
my guilty mind to show:
Thou Quill, that wearied have my hand,
in this no farther go.
The reast by Clymen I
and Aethra will disclose:
Which two are of my counsel chiefs,
in whom I trust repose.
The Argument of the xvij. Epistle, entitled Sappho to Phaon.
Phaon in passage Boat
his pain full living gate,
And ferriyng folk from shore to shore,
relieude his needful state.
It Was Venus hap at last,
without a profred hyre
To Phaon for his painful toil,
a passage to desire.
The Whirryman agreed,
and ferried her for naught,
Whom he no heauenlic Goddess, but
a mortal woman thought.
She in reward a Box
of ointment gave to him,
That could enforce a featurde form,
and make the beauty trim.
Within a while this Lad
the Lasses had allurde,
But wanton Sappho least of all
his beauties beams endurde.
She looude him passing well,
he forste her not a rush:
Her sielie Nymph inragde with love
a thousand cares did crush.
To Sicil Phaon goes,
then Sappho seemd undone,
And thought by speedy leaving life
bir wasting flames to shonne.
From Leucas she pretendes
( Epyrus Mount) to sall,
And so by hastened death to leave
both love and life withal.
To Leucas ere she came,
to suing flat she fill,
And to unfriendly Phaon did
devise this friendly Bill.
In hope to win the Wight,
and purchase love again,
Wherein she tells her twi ching griefer
and pens her pinching pain.
The.xvij. Epistle. Sappho to Phaon.
WHere when thou sawste at first
my loving lines with eye,
Thou knowledge had from whence they came
and notice by and by?
Where if thou had herein
not read the Authors name
And Sappho seen, thou had not known
from whom this writing came?
Demand thou will perhaps
what me procurde to write
This kind of verse, that mirrie tunes
and Luting do delight?
For that this love of mine
is doolefull, and the verse
Elegia callde, a woeful kind
of miter to rehearse.
No Cytheron serves a mourning mind
whom cruel cares do pierse.
As straw does kindle soon,
when Eurus ginnes to drive
The flash into the fertile fields:
even so I fry alive.
To Aetna Phaon now
has taken his way in have:
And me poor wench as great a fire
as Aetnas flame does wast.
I can not frame my frets,
my stubburne strings do jar:
For why, in deed of quiet mind
such verses tokens arre.
Pyrino is forgot,
ne Dryads do delight
My fancy: Lesbian Lasses eke
are now forgotten quite.
Not Amython I force,
nor Cydno passing fine:
Nor Atthis, as she did of yore,
allures these eyes of mine.
Ne yet a hundredth mo
whom (shame ylaid aside)
I fanside erste: thou all that love
from them to thee have wride.
In thee does feature flow,
thy years for daliance apt:
Thy face, O face it is thou that have
my shaken senses rapt.
A Quiver and a Lute
take thou in hand, and thee
Apollo men will deem: d'on horns
and Bacchus thou shall be.
And Phoebus Daphne looude,
king Minos darling dear
God Bacchus lykte, yet neither of both
a Cytherons string could steare.
But me Pegasian Nymphs
have learned on the Lute,
And throughout all the world is borne
of Sapphos songs the brute.
Nor Alcaeus (though upon
a statelier string do sound
My Mate for Art, and Country eke)
a greater praise has found.
Though I at natures hand
no featurde face could gain:
Yet those defaults of kind I quite
by goodness of the brains.
Disdain me not, although
but mean my stature be:
And in pronouncing very short
you Sapphos name do see.
Put case I be not fair?
swarth Andromed to vewe.
Duke Perseus pleased: Morisco soil
allowde her tawnie hew.
Full often the whitest Doves
with specled Culuers tred:
And often we see the Turtle brown
with Popingay does wed.
If none, unless her form
could match thy featurde shape,
Should lincke with thee: thou doubtless should
from marriage aye escape.
But when thou vewdste my verse,
then Sappho seemde in sight
A comely wench, thou swarste that me
alone became to wright.
I sang, I mind it well,
(for Lovers fix in breast
Forepassed toys) and thou the whilste
to kissing thee addreast.
Those busses likte thee eke,
for every point I was
Befancide well: but most when we
to Venus prancks did pass.
Then did my wanton tricks
and lofty mounting, more
With sugared words, delight thy mind
(my Phaon) than of yore.
And that when both our joys
confounded were, I lay
With weary limbs, and languor lame
and had no word to say.
Now are Sicilian trulles
thy novel pray, I see:
In Lesbos what make I? a wench
of Sicill I will be.
O Nysian Matrons, O
Sicilian Dames I say,
This loytring guest of ours expel
your Country bounds I pray.
Ne let his glosing tongue
your listening ears beguile:
For why to us he has ere this
yvsde that self same style.
And Lady Venus, thou
that known art to dwell
(Rue on thy Poets piteous plight)
among the Sicans fell.
Will aye this cruel chance
in one self tenor roonne?
And still persist in spiteful sort
as when her race begoonne?
For but a Babe in years,
and lacking three of nine,
My parents bones I gathered up
and bathde with saltish brine.
My needful brother burnt
with beastly strumpets flame:
And did endure both wrack of wealth
and spiteful loss of fame.
To beggrie brought he plies
the sliding seas with Ore:
And gettes again with shameful shifts
the wealth he spent before.
And me for sound advise
pursues with deadly hate:
This was the only good to me
that my freespeaking gate.
And eake, as though I lackt
a cause to breed my dole,
My little daughter heaps up hoe,
that pretty prattling soul.
But last of all, thou art
the forger of my bale:
Aye me poor wench, my beaten Barcke
flits not with pleasant gale.
Mark out of order how
my lolling tresses flee:
No glistring Gem, or Iuell is
upon my hand to see.
My vesture is but vile,
not spanged is my top:
My hanging hair with Ciuet, nor
Arabian dew does drop.
For whom (unhappy Girl)
should Sappho go so gay?
Whom feeke to please? the Author of
my bravery is away.
My gentle yeeiding breast
each lightsome dart may broose:
And aye I find a cause to love,
and can none other choose.
Or else at time of birth
the sisters set this law:
Allowing me such cruel twist
that did my destnie draw:
Or custom grows to kind,
and use becomes an Art:
I wot not well, but sure I have,
by kind a gentle heart.
What wonder, if with such
a beardlesse youth I were
Attacht, whose tender childish years
allowde his chinne no hair?
I drad (Aurora) least
for Cephalus thou would
Ychosen him: save that thy former
rape does thee withhold.
If Phoebe vewe him once,
that all suruayes with eye:
My Phaon shall be quickly forste
in slumber long to lie.
In Iuorie Wagon would
dame Venus, to the stars
Borne him: but that she fearde he would
have coyde the God of Wars.
O thou that neither art
a boy, nor man in sight,
But aptest age: of all thy race
the most excellent wight,
Come hither, come, and to
my bosom make retowre;
No love I crave in faith of thee,
but thee to love the power.
I write and from my cheeks
the deawie tears distill:
Behold how many blots they cause
in Sapphos doolefull bill.
If needs thou would have gone,
yet this allow for true:
Thou might have said at parture, O
my Lesbian Less adue.
But now no tears of mine
ne latter kiss thou had:
Ne (to be short) of such mishaps
as are befall, I drad.
With me is naught of thine,
save wrong yleft in deed:
Ne gave I warning that thou had
of faithful love the meede.
I gave thee no precepts,
nor would have done a jot:
But made a suit that Sappho might
at no time been forgot.
By love, that never far
may from thy breast astart:
And sacred sisters nine (my saints)
whom I embrace with heart,
I swear: when one exclamde
(I wot nere who to me)
And said, now Sappho iogges thy joy,
thy Phaon now does flee:
I had no tears to shed,
my lips did language lack,
Mine eyes did want their gushing tears
my foltring tongue it stacke
Unto the roufe, and ysie cold
my fearful breast did rack.
When grief was somewhat swagde,
and sorrow began to slake:
I howlde with toren locks, and with
my fist my body struck:
As does the loving Dame
that to the Temple bears
Her Babe his corpse withouten sense,
and bathes his Tomb with tears.
Charaxe my brother ioyde,
and often past before
My face and to and fro did iet
to make my doole the more.
And to increase my shame,
would wit my cause of woe:
And say, why weeps this woman? why?
her daughter lives I trow.
Oh, shame and earnest love
can never well agree:
How there with open breast I stood
the Vulgar folk did see.
Thou Phaon art my carke,
my dreams reduce to mind
Thy countnance: dreams which clearer than
the shining Sun I find.
I meet thee often in sleep,
though thou be nothing nie,
But of this sleep the slipper joys
too soon away do sly.
Full often upon thine arms
my lodging neck I lay:
And then me thinks thy head as much
my limber arms do stay.
I know thy kisses well,
and am not now to seek
How thou were wont to smack thy wench,
and she to do the leeke.
I play the wanton Gyrle
sometime, and seem with thee
To chat, and think my slumbring sense
awaked wide to be.
I blush to tell the reast
that follows, but there is
Naught left undone that breeds delight,
I could not Phaon miss.
But when that Titan splayes
his face, and all beside:
I make complaint that winged sleep
so soon away did slide.
To Groves and Cave I trudge,
as though they did me good:
The Cave and groves that witness there
in place of pleasure stood.
Inragde I thither run,
as does the Frantike fro
Whom fell Erichtho has in chase,
my locks at random go.
There plainly I discrie
with rotten Tophe yspred
A place, that erst in lieu was
to me of better bed.
I find the Wood where we
with boughs and gallant greaues
Yshadowde have full often lain
among the flittring leaves.
The owner is alack
both of the place and me:
The place is but a filthy soil,
the place his dowre was he.
The twifolde turning turffe
I know it very well,
And Grass, with bended head to ground
that with our tumbling fell.
I laid me groufe upon
thy wonted side: the banck
(A pleasant plot of pleasure erst)
my flushing fears it dranck.
Again the naked boughs
(their garments laid in ground)
Did seem to mourn, no mirrie foul
did use his warbling sound.
The woeful Dame alone
that foully was awroke
Upon her son, that Itis hight
in doolefull dittie spoke.
The chyrping Foul her child,
but Sappho wayles her love,
Forlorn Less: when all things else
the slumbers joys do prove.
A Crystal Well there is
than shining Glass more sheere,
A holy spring, some deemen that
some sacred Saint is there.
A watrie Lotos spreades
his sprayes athwart the Well:
And all about with tender Sedge
the greenish ground does smell.
Where woeful wight, when I
had laid me on the grass:
Eftsoone a stripling did appear,
a proper boy it was.
He stood him still and said:
what meanste thou (Nymph) I pray
To fry with such unequal flames?
to Ambrace go thy way.
There Phoebus from a loft
the open sea does face:
Leucadium men they say, or else
Actaeum term the place.
Deucalion thence inragde
with Pyrrhas love did fall
Of purpose, and he naythelesse
sustainde no hurt at all.
And straight conuersed love
forsook his swelting breast
That was ydrencht: and so good man
Deucalion came to reast.
Such is the place his power
and hidden force by kind:
Go thither in post, and skip adowne,
let fear not move thy miude.
He vanished with his voice
I rose me up aghast:
And all to bainde my cheerelesse cheeks
with tears that flushed fast.
I (Nymph quoth I) will trudge
unto the bidden place:
Let raging love have force and power
all fear away to chase.
What fortune so befall,
will better present plight:
O gentle air bear up my corpse
that now is passing light.
And thou (O friendly Love)
come underset thy wing:
Least if I die, defame unto
Leucadian goulfe do spring.
Then I to Phoebus will
my pleasant Lute bequeath:
And bravely cause to be ingraude
this Verse or two beneath.
O Phoebus, this her Lute
has Sappho left to thee:
For in that Art she during life
and thou did well agree.
Fie (Phaon) why do thou
me to Actaeum drive:
And thou thy self may make return
and save thy love alive?
More healthful than the flood
of Leucas thou may be:
And by thy beauties feemely shape
Apollo unto me.
And can thou (oh) more hard
than rock, and ruthlesse wave
If so I die the title of
my death endure to have;
Ah, how much better might
my breast conioyne with thirie,
Than thus be cast from craggie cliffe
to Sea of surging brine?
That self same breast which thou
commended have so often:
And which with passing wisdom fraught
thy self (friend Phaon) thought.
Now would I were faconde,
but dolor hinders Art:
And all my wit is me berest
by long enduring smart.
My wonted vain in verse
is ouerdrie become:
My lowering Lute laments for woe,
my Harp with doole is dombe.
Ye Lesbian Lasses all
that border on the Lake:
And ye that of the Aeolian town
your names are thought to take,
Ye Lesbian Lasses (that
for cause I looude you sore
Breed my defame) unto my Harp
I charge you come no more.
Look what did like you erst,
of that is Phaon sped:
Alas poor wretch, my Phaon I
had very near ysed.
Cause Phaon to retire
and then your Poet will
Reuert again: it is he that does
both make and mar my skill.
What? do my prayers prevail,
or pierce his steely breast?
Or is he standing stiff at stay,
a retchlesse rigorous guest?
Or do the puffing winds transport
my words into the west?
The gale that hence conuaies
my voice, oh that it might
Reduce thy fleeing Barck again,
and bring thy ship in sight.
O ouerlingring Ladde,
in faith if thou were wise,
Thou would attempt to make return
and follow mine advise.
What? will thou come? or no?
we for thy ship prepare
Our vowed gifts: why does thy stay
enforce our hearts to care?
Anale, and lose thy Barcke,
take Seas: for Venus she
That came of seas, will calm the surge
come off the gale will be
As friendly to thy coming Keale
as thou would wish to see.
At Helm will Cupid sit,
and steare thy ship to land:
He both will hoyse, and hale the sails
with skillful Boateswanes hand.
Or if thy pleasure be
from Sappho far to trudge:
(Who never did deserve so ill
of thee, thy self be judge.)
At least let cruel lines
will her unhappy wench
Unto Leucadian foorde to flee,
and there her corpse to drench.
The Argument of the xviij. Epistle, entitled Leander to Hero.
LEander looude a Less that Hero hight
And dwelt in Sest, the channel did divide
Their countries so, as Sestus was in sight
Of Abydon, that stood in the other side.
Nightly the youth to Hero shoope his way,
And would return again before the day.
At length the tempest rose, the winds did blo,
The waters wrought so roughly as they could,
That seven days space Leander might not go
To Sestus shore, as he was wont of old:
But yet by chance a Mariner there went,
By whom these lines unto his Love he sent,
Wherein he shows his Love and faithful heart,
Wherein he plains against the troublous Tide,
And vows at last (all dread yset apart)
To swim the Seas, that he before had tried:
He rather chose to hazard life, than dwell
A week or two from her he looude so well.
The.xviij. Epistle. Leander to Hero.
FRom Abydon these lines
Leander does endite,
And health to Hero sends, which he
would rather bring than write.
If Neptuns waters were
with friendly Gods agreede:
There were no choice for thee to choose,
but thou my words should reed.
But Gods withstand my wish,
and keep my hope arcare:
That will in no wise give me leave
to flitte unto my Fear.
Thy self do see the skies
with pitchie clouds so black,
And waltring waves so tossed with wind
as ships are nie the wrack.
Yet one, than all the reast
more bold, by whom I send
These lines, to Sestus by the Seas
did dare his course to bend.
With whom Leander would
have been imbareked feign:
Had not Abydos given the gase,
and seen his shipping plain.
I could not keep the fact
hid from my Parents eye
As erst I had, but that they would
At length I took my Quill,
wherewith I might endite,
Go blissful scroll to Heroes hands,
than snow (quod I) more white.
First will she thee receive,
and after touch with lip
When she with tooth shall go about
the signed seal to rippe.
These whispring words I spoke
in soft and silent sort:
The reast my writing hand did will
my Paper to report.
That hand wherewith I would
more rather swim than write:
And cut the waves from drenching goulfe
my flitting corpse to quite.
Than fist that fitter is
to clappe the flood that floes:
And yet will serve my turn right well
my secrets to disclose.
Now seven nights are ypast
since Neptunes rage begun:
A year well nie it seems to me,
so flow the time does run.
If any pleasant nappe
or quiet sleep mine eyes
In all this space surprisde: let Seas
persist in prefull wise.
Sitting in doolefull dumpe
upon a rock, I see
Thy strond, my soul is present where
the carcass may not be.
Beside in Turrets top
a Lamb I did discrie:
Or else mine eyes were foul deceyude,
and took their marcke awrie.
Thrice laid I down my robes
in safe and sandy shore:
And naked thrice assayde to swim,
as often I had before:
But swelling waters made
me of my purpose fail,
And by the force of froward streams
did drench me top and tail.
Oh waywardst of the winds,
of Aeols Impes the wurst?
Why do thou show thy self to me,
so cruel and so cursed?
I, not the surging Seas,
of this sustain the smart:
This were enough if thou of love
had never fealt the dart.
For though with cold thou quake,
yet can thou not deny,
But that with Orithias flame
thy frostie flesh did fry.
When thou wast fully bent
Dame Venus sportes to try:
If any had restrainde thy course
thou would have lookte awrie.
Oh, (Boreas) tame thy wrath,
rebate thy raging ire:
So Aeole give thee naught in charge
but as thou would desire.
My suit is all for naught
my labor is in vain,
He does not seek the tossed waves
to maken smoouth again.
Would Daedal would allow
me wished wings at will:
Though by such slight his son into
the neighbor waters fill.
What fortune so should chance
Leander would abide:
To fine his fethred corse might flee
on waves that wont to slide.
But whilste I am debarrde
by wrath of wave and wind
To furrow Seas: I do revoke
my passed joys to mind.
When Phoebus began to fall,
and gave his Sister place:
(I joy to think) my Fathers lodge
I fled with speedy pace.
And straight with shifted robes
all dread I did remove:
And in the flood I flong mine arms,
the Delphins Art to prove.
The Moon did shine as light
as any Sunnie day:
As one that would with all her power
assist me in the way.
I casting up mine eyes
on her that clearly shinde:
Said. Mercy (Moon) thy Mariner:
call Latmus Hill to mind.
Endymion thee denies
to bear a ruthlesse heart:
Wherefore to these my secret stealthes
thy friendly face conuart.
Thy self (a Goddess) did
a mortal Wight embrace:
And she, whom I pursue, is even
a Goddess for her face.
I leave her thewes untouched,
wherein she may compare
With heavenly Peers, such feature falls
on earthly creatures rare.
Save Venus passing shape,
and thine unspotted face
Is none whom she ne does excel,
thy self discern the case.
How much thy golden Lamp
(when thou thy pride do show)
Surmounts all other streaming stars
that in their circles glow:
So far surpasses she
each other mortal wight:
And if thou doubt thereof, good faith
deluded is thy light.
Such words I did pronounce,
or not unlike to these,
Whilst I by night directed course,
amid the yielding Seas.
The water glistred with
rebounds of Phoebes rays:
And night for clearness might compare
even with the brightest days.
No voice I heard with ear,
but every thing was hushed:
Save whilst my body brake the waves
the troubled water rusht.
Alcyones alone
did use a pleasant note:
And did record Ceycus love
with sweet and warbling throat.
At length my hands gave up,
mine arms could work no more:
Then stood I on the waves aloft,
and cast mine eyes to shore.
No sooner saw I light:
My love is yonder way
(Quoth I) that coast does harbor her
on whom my life does stay.
Then straight my strength renude,
mine arms had force again:
Me thought (than erst) the foming Seas
I swam with lesser pain.
The ardent gleames I bare
in close and loving breast,
Would not permit that I should be
with watrie cold oppressed.
The more I came to shore,
or did approach the land:
Me thought I could a greater charge
of swimming take in hand.
But when I came in sight
that thou might take the vewe:
Thy gladsome looks my fainting force
with comfort did renew.
Then shewde I all my skill,
to feed thy hungry eyes:
And, for thou might decerne mine arms,
I heaude them to the skies.
Thee from the flowring foorde
thy Nurce could scarce restrain:
With fixed eye I markte it well,
and saw it passing plain.
Whom though the Hag withheld,
as was in her to do:
Yet with the swelling Tide thou wettste
the leather of thy shoe.
And clasping me in arms
did kiss Leander often:
Such kisses as of Gods by Seas
were worthy to be sought.
And from thy shoulders gauste
me garments of the best:
And dridste my hair that was beedewde,
and with the waves oppressed.
The reast, thy guilty tower,
the night, and we do know:
And Phoebe with her friendly Lamp
that did my passage show.
That nights surpassing joys
no bett may be discryude,
Than Hellespontus waltring waves,
that Helles life depriude.
How shorter was the space
on Venus to bestow,
We took the greater heed that it
in idle might not go.
Thus wears away the night,
and Lucifer the Star
Declares that Tythons loving spouse
(Aurora) is not far.
Then forging doolefull plaintes
that Nox has run her race
With over hasty foot, our friendly
kisses walk apace.
But when the crabbed Nurse
begins to chide and chowre,
With heavy heart I take my course
to Seawarde from the Tower.
At parture both lament,
to Helles goulfe I go:
And whilst the furge will give me leave,
to thee my looks I throw.
In faith unto thy stronde
I like my swimming well;
But backwarde when I bend my course,
it likes me never a dell.
And certes, when I come,
the middle Sea seems plain:
But rough and full of hanging Hills
when I retire again.
And (little would thou think)
I stay against my will
In Abydon I long to lodge
with thee in Sestus still.
Oh Gods, why should the surge
two lincked hearts denide?
Why they that are of greeing minds,
one hostage are denide?
Else I with thee in Sest
would make a long soiourne:
Or thou with me to Abydon
should shape a quick return.
I force not on the place,
so we yfeare may dwell,
Thou louste my Abydos, and I
thy Sestus like as well.
Why do I cease to swim
for raging waters ire?
Or why the roaring wind (a slender
cause) makes me retire?
Now crooked Delphins know
the faithful heart I bear:
All other kind of scaly fish
will for Leander swear.
With passing to and fro
I have a path ymade
In waters, as the Carts are wont
where chiefly lies their trade:
Which could not come to pass
with flitting now and than:
That now for winds I can not do
the like, I curse and ban.
Now drenched Helles flood
is so with tempest tossed:
As Hulkes in harbor hardly save
themselves from being lost.
When she poor siely wench
by waters lost her life,
I judge that tho th'infamed waves
were at a semblant strife.
This Goulfe has hate enough
and shame for drowning one:
Wherefore it may the better let
Leanders life alone.
I spite at Phrixus fate
that on the golden Ram,
These fretting Seas in spite of waves
and surges safely swamme.
But I will neither sheep,
nor aid of Ship require:
If so the waters would be such
as swimmers would desire.
No foreign help I crave,
so waves go not too rough:
My self will be the passage Boats
and Bargeman well enough.
I will by neither Bear
direct my stearelesse ship.
My love such public peevish stars.
esteems but as a chippe.
Let those that list behold
Andromade the fair:
The golden crown, or Parrhasis
that shines in Northren air:
Leander makes no coumpt
of any of their light:
No not of her whom Perseus chose,
or Bacchus for delight.
Another star I have
surmounting all the rest:
That will not see mine earnest love
with darcksome cloud oppressed.
Whereon when I so gaze,
to Colchos Launcher bound
As Jason did, I travel could,
or to a further ground.
I would in flitting far
Palaemons cunning pass:
Or Glaucus that became a God
by tasting of the grass.
Mine arms do often ache
with sundring of the wave:
That scarcely can I swim to shore
my weary corpse to save.
But when I say (good cheer,
you shall not fail your hyre,
And for your pain eftsoons you shall
to Heroes neck aspyre.)
Then wonted valiant force
begins to grow again:
And like a Courser forth I thrust
that would be foremost feign.
Thus I my burning flames
reserve in covert breast:
And thee pursue of heavenly staule
as worthy as the best.
Yet though thou well deserve
a heavenly wight to be:
Demour in earth, or make me show
how I may come to thee.
I see it thence proceeds
that I thee seld enjoy:
And thence it comes that with my mind
the wrathful Seas annoy.
What gaynes Leander though
the passage be but small?
For him it were as good that these
were wydest Seas of all.
I somewhat doubtful stand,
what first to wish or crave:
To be so nigh, or farther off
both love, and hope to have.
The nearer I approach,
the more my flame does gleede:
I lack the thing I most desire,
though Hope mine humor feed.
I may welnigh with arms,
(so near it is) embrace,
And not enjoy: which makes the tears
often times imbrue my face.
I may my lotte compare
with Tantals hungry lore:
That has both food and lyquor by,
yet famine bytes him sore.
What shall I never strain
thee in my folded arms
But when the water lift? redress
is none for those my harms?
And since no surety may
in wind and waves be found,
Shall all his hoped trust in waves
and wind Leander ground?
If tempests thus do rage
whilst Aestas is in place:
How will they rore, when watery signs
shall show their storinie face?
Or else I do not know
my fond and witless rage:
Or else even then I shall my corpse
unto the goulfe engage.
And least thou should surmise
my painted promise vain:
My deed shall well approve my words
within a day or twain.
Ere many nights shall pass,
(in spite of Neptuns power)
I mind to swim the swelling Seas
Leander dreades no shower.
For either will I live,
and Heroes love enjoy.
Or by my death of careful love
abandon all annoy.
And so it sort I die,
this only boon I crave,
My carcass to be cast on land
with thee his Heirse to have.
I know thou will both touch,
and eke deplore the same:
And say (Leander) I thy death
against my will did frame.
This fell abodement may
perhaps offend thy heart:
And these forespeaking lines of mine
increase thy silent smart.
Let all such fancies go,
help (Hero) to request
That waltring waters may be calm,
and belking Seas at rest.
Small time of truce will serve
to bring me to thy shore:
When I am there let Neptune frown,
and ruthlesse Channel rore.
There may Leander make
a safe and sicker stay:
His ship no surer harbor can
nor Barck have better Bay.
Let Boreas me include
where I so feign would be:
And then Leander loath to swim
from Sestus thou shall see.
I will not then go scolde
with deeffe Seas as to fore:
Ne yet, that waters are unjust
in wonted wise deplore.
Let Heroes arms withholde,
Let winds enforce my stay:
Let double cause prevail to stop
Leander if they may.
When tempest shall permit,
to Sestus will I hie:
See that thy Lamp be burning aye
for fear I swim awrie.
The while receive my lines
I wrote with quaking pen:
Ere long myself will be with thee,
if fortune say Amen.
The Argument of the xix. Epistle, entitled Hero to Leander.
WHen Hero had Leanders lines receiude,
His loving letters read, and thoroughly scand:
His faithful heart and constance she perceiude,
Which made her write again with willing hand.
Some time for sluggish him the Wench controlde,
To show her self a loving Less in deed:
Some time she biddes him not to be too bold,
Nor hasten more to Sestus than were need.
Now cries she out against the Mounting waves,
And craves a calm at cruel Neptuns hand:
And by and by with Aeolus she raues,
And Boreas blamde, that did her love withstand.
Some time she dreades least she forelorne were,
(As common trade of Lovers is to do:)
But last of all she wills him to forbere,
And not to come whilst winds did bluster so,
And waters warrde, that peril was to pass
The curssed stream where Hell drenched was.
The.xix. Epistle. Hero to Leander.
THe health thou sent in words,
that I may have in deed:
Do way (Leander) all excuse
and come thy way with speed.
All stay torments me sore,
that does my joys expel:
And mercy, since I do confess
I love thee passing well.
We both do burn alike
and fry with egall flame:
But I am weakest of the two,
my nature wills the same.
As women's corse is faint,
so are their minds not strong:
If thou do not repair at once
I shall be dead ere long.
You men contriue the time
and loathsome tide away:
Sometime in tillage of your soyles,
sometime you hunt the day.
Sometime at open bar
you plead a Clients case:
To Tennis now, and then with horse
you runn a lusty race.
Sometime you pitch for foul,
for fish you lay your line:
And when the day is spent and gone,
you fall to quaffing wine.
Now I can none of these
though lesser were my flame:
Thy Hero can do nothing else
but cleape her lovers name.
And that which sole remaynes
(Leander) that I prove:
And, more than any wight would deem,
I rage with ardent love.
Or I with Beldam Nurce
do sit, and chatte of thee,
And do not little muse what should
thy cause of lingering be:
Or seeing Seas to surge
by mean of windy flawes:
In thy behalf I check the winds
with wide and wreakefull jaws.
Or when the calmed Seas
have somewhat quaylde their power:
I say thou may, but wilt not come
to Heroes wonted tower.
Amid my griefull plaintes
the saltish tears gush out
By streams which crooked Nurce does wipe,
and dryes with Linen clout.
Often times I seek in sand
where I thy steps may find:
As though the foot once gone, the print
would aye remain behind.
I ask when any came,
or any minds to go
To Abydon: to fine I might
thy state by writing know.
What should I speak how often
I kiss with loving lip
The robes which tho thou lefest behind
when thou to Sea did skippe?
Thus when the day is spent,
and night our friendfull ride
Has banished Phoebus from the Pole,
and stars do show their pride:
In stately turrets top
a blazing Lamp I set:
Whereby thou wonted are my shore
and perilous stronde to fette.
Then I to pass the time
in haste to Distaffe coonne:
An Art which woraen use the griefs
of yrkesome stays to shoonne.
O that thou knewste my words,
that I pronounce the while:
Leanders name is all my talk,
Leander is my style.
How think you (Nurse) is he
by this come out of door?
Or does he stand in dread of scowtes
that on his passage poor?
Has he remooude his robes?
(good Beldame tell thy mind)
Or oylde his ventrous careless corpse
as swimmers wont by kind?
With that she gives a nod,
not for she hears my talk:
But drowsy slumber so procures
her gogling head to walk.
And then I pawse a stounde:
then (now he flitts) I say,
And with his well approved arms
he beats the waves away.
Then spinne I for a space,
and twist a threede or twain:
And where thou be in middle Seas
to learn I am full feign.
Sometime I give the gaze
where I may see thee swim:
And then we pray that Neptune will
not show his cheer too grimme.
Sometime we hear with ear
a noise that makes us think,
That thou art then ycome to shore
and safe to Sestus brincke.
Thus when the greatest part
of night is flitted by:
The slumbring sleep by secret stealth
inuades my weried eye.
Then (against thy will perhaps)
thou do with me foiourne:
And (though thy self would feign dislodge)
yet art thou here atourne.
For now I seem to see
thee swimming in the flood:
And then to throw thy limber arms
on Heroes back a good.
Another while with clothes
and wonted robes I hide
Thy moysted limbs, and lay me dowlie
fast by thy wished side.
And other toys to taste
and other feats to frame:
Which though I ioyde to put in ure,
my tongue to tell does shame.
Oh me unhappy wench
whose pleasure makes no stay,
And falsed is: for thou with fleepe
art wont to slip away.
O Lord let us that love
at length which firmer lace
Inchaine our selves: let dreams no more
true pleasurs so deface.
Why have I lodgde alone
so many nights arowe
In cold and careful couch? why do
thou prove thy self so stowe?
As now the waters are
too boysteous I confess
For such as swim: but yesternight
Neptunus rage was less.
Why lettste thou slip that lide?
thou should have fearde the wurst:
And not have stood in earnest hope
for better than the furst.
What though the weather shape
as well again to swim?
Yet that, because it was the first,
of both I judge it t^m.
For Seas have sudden change,
the flood is altered soon:
And when thou willing art to come
thy course is sooner done.
Arriude to Sestus shore,
no cause thou should at all
Have of regreete: thee in mine arms
what winter storm might gall?
Then I with gladsome mind
would hear the winds to rage:
And pray that Neptuns surging Seas
their swelling might not swage.
But how befell you fear
your wonted passage so,
And dreede the goulfe you scornd ere this?
the cause I long to know.
For yet I well record
that when thou camste to Sest,
The Channel was as rough, or nie
as rough as may be gest.
When I exclamde aloude,
(mine own) be not too bold:
Least I be forced to rue thy fate,
if I thy death behold.
Whence comes this sudden fear?
where is that courage now?
Where he that scornde the force of floods
and waters wont to flow?
Yet naythelesse be wise,
not retchlesse as thou were:
And swim in safety if thou may,
if not a while forbear.
So that thy faith be one,
as those thy lines did show:
And so that kindled flame of thine
to cinders do not grow.
I dread not so the winds
that bar my wished joy:
As least thy love, will like the wind
exchange by change of toye.
Of this I stand in awe,
least peril pass the gain:
And least thou think thy booty far
inferior to thy pain.
Sometime I quake for fear
least Abydon deface
My Sest, and least Leander think
his Hero far too base.
But all I can endure,
with well contented will,
So that thou have no dainty Dra^
thy pleasures to fulfill.
So that no strumpets arms
about thy neck depend:
Nor novel love procure thy first
and former flame to end.
Oh rather let me die
than such a crime to know,
Let Heroes lively twist be shrid,
ere thou do trespass so.
Not for thou gauste me causs
of future grief, I speak
In such a wise: no new report
moves me my mind to break,
Save that I fear the worst,
Who loves deuoyde of dreede?
The place does forte the absent wight
often times on fear to feed.
Oh happy Nymphs whom place
and presence makes to know
Committed crimes, and keeps from sear
of things that are not so.
No less the forged fact
than wrong ydone in deed
Does move our minds: from both alike
like dolor does proceed.
Oh, that thou wouldste repair
or else thy cause of let
From winds and grutching father might,
and from no woman fet.
Which if I heard of troth,
for grunting grief I die:
And great will be thy guilte, if so
thy love thou seek to strie.
But more than needs I dread
thou will not so offend:
For churlish tempest is in fault
that will not let thee wend:
O Gods, what mounting floods
do drive against the shore?
How does the darkesome cloud enclose
and keep the light in store?
Perhaps the virgins Dame
is commen to the flood:
And for her drenched dearling sheddes
her saltish tears a good.
Or Ino being woxe
a Seanymph but of late,
Turmoyles the Goulfe, that Hell brought
to such untimely fate.
That flood does nothing-friend
the Maiden sex I know:
For there did Hell lose her life,
where Heroes hurt does grow.
But (Neptune) waying well
and calling often to mind
Thy former flames, me thinks thou should
not hinder love by wind.
For Amymon can well,
and Tyro try at neade,
That thou were truly touched with love
as we in stories read.
Alcyone the fresh,
and Iphimedia fair:
Medusa on whose skull as then
there hoong no hissing hair.
Laodice the brown,
Celaeno fixed in sky:
Whose names I sundry times have read,
and seen with searching eye.
With these, and diverse else
(of whom the Poets write)
Thou (Neptune) chambred have full often,
and past in loves delight.
Why then that have so often
the valiant force of love
Assayde, by tempest to forelet
our wonted course do prove?
Cruel be calm awhile,
wage war where Seas be wide:
This is a slender Channel that
two Countries does divide.
It better would beseem
a high and haughty Roy,
To hoyse the Hulkes, to broile with Barks,
or Nauies to annoy.
It Is shame for God of Goulfe
a swimming youth to sincke:
Each little Lake this conquest would,
and spoil unsitting think.
He is of noble blood,
not of Ulysses line:
At whom, not undeservedly
thou (Neptune) do repine.
Give leave, at once save two:
for though he sole do swim,
Yet in the self same tossing Tide
my hope consistes in him.
Meanewhile the Torch (for by
a Torch I sit and write)
Does happer, a blissful sign that all
shall not success aright.
Behold how Beldame poures
the wine into the flame:
And says (to morrow we shall be mo)
and drinckes upon the same.
Oh, come by fliding Seas,
increase the tale by one:
Thou whom I fix in faithful breast,
and let delays alone.
Home to thy tents retire,
that fleest thy friendly spouse:
Why do I sole amid my Couch
my careful carcass rouse?
No cause there restes of dread,
the bold is sure of grace
At Venus hands: she that was bred
of floods, will rue thy case.
My self often times to meet
in middle Goulfe do dare:
Save for the flood is friend to men,
not women wont to spare.
For why (when Phrixus with
his loving sister came
By Sea) did Helles only give
the ghastly Goulfe his name:
Perhaps you dread return,
least force will fail you fear?
You stand in doubt you may not well
this double travail bear.
Wherefore make have, and meet
thy friend amids the flood:
And there aloft upon the waves
shall kisses walk a good.
That done, let either to
his stronde reuert again:
Though this were small, it is better some,
than naught at all to gain.
Would either bashful shame
that feeds this serret fire,
Or fearful love would yield to fame:
of both I the one desire.
For ill they can agree,
that never are at truce:
The One sweet, and the other seemly is,
I wot nere which to choose.
When Jason did arrive
at Colchos careful port:
He his Medea well imbarckt
did thence with speed transport.
No sooner Priams son
to Lacedaemon came:
But straight he made return to Troie
with famous Grecian Dame.
But thou as often leauste
thy liked love behind
As doste repair: and comste when ships
may scarcely pass for wind.
Be naythelesse auisde
(thou Victor of the Seas:)
So scorn the flood as thou may fear
least Neptune thee disease.
Huge, high, and haughty Hulks,
yframde by Art do fail:
And can thou deem thine arms will more
than shaven Ores prevail?
The Pylates stand afright
the shelfes thou swimste to cost:
For Barks ybroosde, and shaken ships,
in such a sort are lost.
Oh me unlucky wench,
I would not thus dissuade,
But be as bold for all my words
as is thy wonted trade:
So safely thou ariue,
and lay those arms of thine
Upon my back, that often were beat
with Sea of bealking brine.
But I wot nere what cold
my quaking breast does nomme,
As often as to my restless mind
a thought of Seas does comme.
My last nights dream torments
and makes me sore afright:
Though I to Morpheus ere I slept,
had done my sacred right.
In creake of dawning day
when torchlight began to fail:
(A tide when true undoubted dreams
the slumbring corse assail)
Out of my sleeple hands
the twisted twine did fall,
And to my pensive Pillow I
my head applyde withal.
And with vnfalsed faith,
and certain sight I saw
A crooked Delphin flit in flood,
ytost with windy flawe.
Who when by drift of waves
and turning Tide was tossed
To sandy shore: he both at once
his life and waters lost.
What so it be I dread,
have not in scorn my dreams:
Ne (yet unless the waters serve)
commit thy corse to streams.
If self care all be past,
yet way thy friendly Mate,
Whose wealth and welfare does depend
upon thy healthful state.
I hope that yrefull Seas
will shortly be at reast:
Then do thou break the calmed waves
with safe and sicker breast.
Meanewhile, cause surge turmoilde
thy passage does restrain:
Let loving lines ysent, abridge
some part of lingering pain.
The Argument of the xx. Epistle, entitled Acontius to Cydippe.
To Delos, where the rites
were done to Dians grace
Acontius trauailde, many Nymphs
and Maidens were in place.
Atroupe to Temple came,
but one above the rest
( Cydippe namde,) with loving dart
did craze Acontius breast.
Who for be saw the wight
unequal in estate:
Surmisde he should not for his life
have given her the mate.
Yet naythelesse at length
he bourded her with guile:
And in a goodly Apple did
enclose this crafty style.
By Dians sacred rytes
and mysteries I swear,
That I will make repair to thee
and be thy friendly Feeare.
In Temple at her feet
he floong the flattring fruit:
She took it up, and read the rymes.
Cydippe woxe as mute
As fish, and Scarlet red
her lilly Cheeks became:
For having made a vow she knew
she should observe the same.
For what so was beheight
before Dianas face,
By commen order was decreede
should take effect and place.
Her Father after this
unwitting of the oath
His daughter made, Cydippe to
another did betrothe.
Meanewhile the silly wench
with Fevers was oppressed,
And fealt a thousand furious fits
ybreeding her unrest.
Acontius in his lines
induces her to thinck
This Fever feign by Dians wrath,
forcause she sought to shrinck
Hnd false her plighted faith
in presence and in place
Of all those sacred Saints, but most
of good Dianas grace.
The.xx. Epistle. Acontius to Cydippe.
ABandon dread, for to thy Lover thou
shall frame no farther hest ne swear again:
Thy once engaged faith I recke enough.
Read and suruay my lines: so may this griefs
And languor leave thy corpse, which is my tene
When any limme of thine sustaineth smart.
Why blush you? and why with vermilion taint
Beflecke your cheeks? in Dians temple so
I deem thy face with scarlet hue infect.
Marrige and plighted troth, no crime I crave:
I love not as a Letcher, but a spouse.
Revoke to mind the words in Apple graude,
Which to thy guiltless hands I did project.
There shall thou find confirmde by solemn oath,
That I require: unless both fired faith
And words at once out of thy breast are fled.
Even as I drad in deed, the Goddess frettes.
O Nymph, thou rather than the Goddess should
Stand mindful of thy Hest and promise made:
And now I fear the like. But oh to more
Her raging force is grown, and flame increast
By lingering stay. And love that never was
Slender, by yielded hope in process springs.
Thou gauste me hope, my love leant faith thereto
That Dian witnesde thou can not withsaye.
She tho was pressed, and noted well the words
And seemde with moved tresse to give assent.
Report that by deceit thou were intrapt,
Whilst Cupid did enforce me forge the fraud.
What meant my craft but to be linckt with thee?
That thou complainste, may well me reconcile.
Not guilefull I by use, or nature am,
Me thou (my wenche) in faith have subtle made.
(If I did ought by Art) with sleightfull words,
The wilye Love has fast with me enchainde:
I knit the knot with words that he pronounst,
And crafty I by Cupids counsel, woxe.
Let guile sustain the name, let me be said
Subtille, if things beloude to win, be craft.
Behold, I write a fresh, and frame request,
Another frande whereof thou may complain.
If I, in that I love, annoy thee so,
Incessantly I will: and though thou be
Full well aduisde, I will pursue thee aye.
Others by sword have many Nymphs purloynd
And shall a letter forgde by crafty slight,
To me as heinous crime objected be?
Gods grant I thee in faster knot may chain.
As thou may never find a way to start,
Nor fly thy fixed faith. A thousand tricks
There are, and I in that one travail toil,
Nothing my love permits untried to go.
Though doubtful be where thou will yield or no,
(The end is in the Gods,) but thou shall yield,
And be entrapt, and forced in fine to bow.
Some toils put cuse thou escape? yet all the ginnes
Thou can not pass which crafty Cupid pight:
More Nets there are than thou surmisde to be.
If Art may not avail, to arms we will,
And I will thee, as rape atchiude enjoy.
I am not he that Paris fact controlle,
Nor any that such manlike parts have playde.
And I. But now no more: though death ensue
This rape, should less aggrieue than thee to lose.
Oh, would you were worse featurde than thou art,
With reason then of me thou should be sought:
Thy-face does me to valiance now procure.
Thou, and thine eyes (surpassing flaming stars,
Which were the causers of my glowing gleade)
In me this courage moves, and stoutnesse stirs,
Thy yellow golden locks, thy yuorie neck,
Thy hands, (of whom I long to be accold,)
Thy feature, and thy blusshing countenance
Deuoyde of rustickes grace: and feet such as
With Thetis may compare, this boldness breeds,
More fortunate were I, if all the reast
I might condignly praise: but doubt I naught
But that the whole unto his parts agrees.
By this thy form enforst, no marvel though
I sought to have thy parling voice his pledge.
In fine, since that thou art constrainde to yield
Thy self beguilde, by my deceytfull slight
(O Virgin) be thou conquerde at the last.
Let me sustain the hate, and reap the fruit
For hatred so endurde: So heinous crime
And blame why does it want his earned hire?
Hesion Ajax, Briseis Achylles took,
And either of them their Victor did ensue.
Me spare not to accuse, ne stick to wrath
Me, so I may thee angry wight enjoy.
We that procurde the ire, will pease the same
If never so little leisure be allowde,
And respite given to lessen swelling wrath.
Let me besprent with tears tofore thy face
Stand, adding to my tears lamenting sound?
And as the frequent use of Vassels is,
When they of lashing scourge do stand in awe,
(Groufe at thy feet, stretch out my yielding hands)
What? know you not thy right and Mistres power?
Cite me. In absence why am I accusde?
As Ladies woont^, give me in charge t'appeare.
Though thou my tresses tear in stately sort,
And make my face with buffets black and blewe:
Yet all I will endure, fearing but that
My body should thy tender fifies annoy.
In Chain or Give it is needelesse me to bind
Inlaste in love, that have no power to flee.
When so thy wrath with wreak shall be repleate,
And anger be reuengde: thy self shall say
Oh God, how patiently the man does love?
Thy self shall say (when I have all endurde)
My servant thou that seruste so well shall be.
In absence why am I (vnluekie) dee mde
Guilty? and though my cause be passing good
Yet for default of Patron, goes to wrack?
The bill that Cupid wrote, and gave in charge,
It is my wrong and practisde injury,
This only fact in me thou must reprove.
Dian with me deserved not the bob.
If so the thing to me thou have behight
Thou loath to yield, let Delia bear the same.
For being pressed she saw when thou intrapt
Did blush, in mindful ear the words she plast.
Abodements laid ayart more fiercer than
Diana, (when she sees her Godhead wrongde,)
There is not any God, nor half so stern.
The Calydonian Boar can well record:
For by his mean, how cruel was the Dame
Unto her son, we have full often read.
Witness Acteon eke, that fed his Hounds
That erst with them had sundry quarries made.
The haughty Mother too to Marble turnde,
In ruthful sort that in Migdoni stands?
Aye me (Cydip) I dread the troth to tell,
Least I be thought for goodding of my cause
False matter to allege: yet needs I must
Now plead the same. This is the cause (in faith)
That thou at Nuptial day art so diseasde,
Unable from the sickle Couch to rise.
Dian would do thee good, and pains her sore
Least you should be forsworn: she gladly would
The sicklesse, and unbroken Hest reserve.
Thence it preceedes (as often as thou do seek
To swerve thy faith) yt she thy carcass plagues*
Leave off to stir the cruel Virgins Bow:
Yet if thou will to ruth she may be brought.
Spare thou thy corse with Fevers to molest,
Reserve thy featurde face for me to use:
That countnance keep, to set my heart on flame
By nature made, where Rose with Lilly strives*
So fare my foe, and who so else does bar
Thee to be mine, as the diseasde I live.
My grief is one, or when thou linckest with
An other wight, or feelste tormenting teene,
I wot not which I recke the worst of both.
Sometime it yrkes me that I breed thy doole,
Deeming thy gripes by my deceit to grow,
Praying the plague of perjury to redounde
On me, that thou might by my scath escape.
And often to wit, and understand thy plight,
Doubtful (God wot) I wander to and fro,
Thy Maid at inches suing and thy Man,
Demanding how thy meat, and sleep avail,
Woe me, that I the rules of Physic scorn,
And put them not in ure, ne wring her wrestes,
Ne on her cowch for comfortes sake, do lie.
And woe again, that I absent me thence,
An other perhaps, whom I ne would, is pressed.
He feels thy pulses, and does sit him down
By thy diseased corse, hateful to Gods,
And with the Gods, of me detested too.
And whilst with thumb he feels ye leaping veins,
He strains by mean thereof, thy snowish arms,
Handling thy breast, and by escheate perhaps
A kiss does gain of those thy sugared lips,
A greater guerdon than his pain deserude.
Who gave thee leave my harvest to forereape?
Unto an others hope, who made thy way?
That bosom (friend) is mine, fowlly from me
My kisses thou bereauste: wherefore do way
Thy flippant fist from that my pacted corpse.
Unthrift, do way thy hands, the thing thou feelst
Is me behight: hereafter if thou do
The like, thou shall a Leachers name procure.
On single Nymphs, and not dispoused Maids
Make choice: I would thou wist, this is possessed.
Believe not me give to the bargain, ear,
And cause her read the writing, to this end
Thou deem her not untrue or false to be.
Go from another bridal bed, I say,
What makst thou here? go pack, this knot is tide.
Put case thou have a party promise eake?
Yet is thy cause and mine unequal far.
She made me perfect vow: her Sire the Nymph
To thee behight: but nearer than her Sire,
Unto her self the sielie Maiden stands.
Her Father made a promise: she by oath
Conioynde her self in league of stayde love.
He witnesde men: She Dian did protest.
He dreades the name of Liar to sustain:
But she the blot of periurde tongue to bear.
Of both deem thou which is the greater fear.
And last of both the perils to compare,
Respect the events of both, and latter lotte.
She lies diseasde: he lives releast of woe.
And we with dispar minds for her contend
Ne hope to both, nor egall is the dread.
Thou forcest not the suit: more griefull were
Repulse to me than death: already I
Embrace the Maid, whom thou in future time
And after this may have the hap to love.
If justice, or regard of right did lodge
Within thy breast, you to my flames would yield
Now since this furious wight maintains a strife
In wrongful cause, (Oh Cydip) to what end
Do I to thee fruitless lines endite?
He breeds thy doole, and makes thee be suspect
Of Dian: him (if thou be wise) renounce.
Bar, and forbid him to approach thy lodge.
These perrils by his mean thou doste endure:
That would he might acquit thy corse from we,
That forger is of these thy pinching pains.
Whom if thou flee, and lincke with him in love
Whom Dian not condemns: release of fittes
Thy self shall find, and I shall be reuiude,
Virgin exile thy fear, doubt not recure,
Reverence the temple where thou madste ye vow
The Gods delight not with a flaughtred Ox,
But with a faith performde without record.
Some women health to gain, and purchase ease,
Both scarring Lance, and scalding flame endure:
Other the bitter drench acquites of pain.
These needelesse are to thee: flee perjury:
Thy self, thy Hest, and me referue at once.
Pardon of passed crime by ignorance
Shall be procurde: quite from thy mind was fled
And plighted promise quite thy thought exilde.
Thee both my words, and these thy present haps
Have warned, which thy careful corse assault
As often as thou from pawned faith do wrie:
When these are ouerblowne in travel thou Will crave of her, of baron to be well
And soon releast, and have thy throws abridgde.
Which she will hear, and rolling in her mind
Will ask, who was the sielie infants Sire?
Thou will auow. She knows thy Hest untrue.
Thou will protest, and bind with sacred oath:
But she wottes well thou can the Gods beguile.
It nothing touches me: yet greater hoe
I have, and careful is my heart of thy
Indaungred life, that now in peril stands.
Why lately did thy doubtful Parents mourn,
For thy distress, whom thou thy crime co^cealdste?
And why are they unwitting of thy guilt?
Cydip, thy deeds deserve no shame at all.
Display in order thine acquaintance first
With me, as to Dian thou did thy rites:
And how, when first (if well thou did attend)
I saw thy face, I stayed, and gave the gaze,
Vewing with staring eyes thy comely corse,
And whilst I muzde thereat (a sicker sign
Of frenzy) from my back my vesture flid.
And after, how by hap (thou wottste not how)
A rolling Apple trillde, with lines ingraude
Thereon, which were by subtle slight deuisde:
Which being read by thee, in presence of
The sacred Goddess, bound thy faith in band,
Which, cause Diana heard, must not be slipped.
And to the fine she may the writing know,
As erst thou did, so read the same again.
Wedde (will she say) with my good will, to him
With whom ye blissful Gods have thee co^ioynd,
Let be my son, whom thou to spouse have taken,
Who so it be, shall like me, for he erst
Has stood in Dians grace. Thy Mother thus
Will say, if so that she thy Mother be.
If who, and what I am, she make demand,
Let her behold, and she shall well perceive
That well for thee Diana has puruayde.
The famous I Will (where the Coritian Nymphs
Did lodge of yore, inuironde with the Sea
Aegaeum,) Caea cleaped is the soil
Where I was bred: and (if thou do accoumpt
Of Gentiles blood) my Grandsires were of fame.
And we are wealthy eke, our manners are
Not fraught with shameful crimes, suppose there were
Naught else? yet love has shackled us yfeare.
Unsworn thou might selected such a spouse,
And never forced with such a husband wed.
This is my dream, Phoebe the Archeresse,
And Love awakt, did will me write to thee:
Of whom th'ones darts have thirled erst my heart,
Beware least th'ochers shafts do thee annoy.
Our healthes are ioynde in one: Rue on thy self
And me: why do thou stagger both to ease?
Which if befall, when blasted Trumpe shall sound,
And Delos be with yolded blood imbrude:
The golden Image of the blissful fruit
Shall stand aloft, with cause in myter graude.
Acontius, by the Apples form, records
Th'insculped lines to have been brought to pass.
But least thy weakened limbs, and feeble corpse.
My over long Epistle should molest:
To fine I may in wonted manner end,
Aconce thy friend, biddes the (Cydip) adue.
The Argument of the xxj. Epistle, entitled Cydippe to Acontius.
WHen Cydip saw her furious fits increase,
And fretting Fever grow to worse disease,
Then thought she verily that no release
Was to be had, unless she might appease
Dianas wrath: wherefore she thought it best
To stand unto her former plighted hest.
Then took she pen in hand, then began she write
These following lines to Aconce, making show
That she would yield, and banish rigor quite,
And pay the det to him that she did owe:
Craving his help in peasing Goddess ire,
That she to health the sooner might aspyre.
The.xxj. Epistle. Cydippe to Acontius.
A Fright in silence I thy lines suruayde,
Least yt unawares my tongue to witness should
Have callde the Gods, and for records appealde.
I deem thou would have bourded me again.
With craft, had you not thought in judging mind
One Hest (as thou confessed) to have suffisde.
He had I vewde thy lines and Letters sent,
But that I thought the yrefull Goddess wrath
By duresse would to further rage increast.
For all that I can do, though incense I
To Dian offer, yet she friends thee more
Than reason wills she should: and as thou crauste
Credit to win: so she with mindful wrath
Upon my corse for thee awroken is.
So stiffely scarce by Hippolyte she stood.
But she (a Virgin) rather should have shown
Favor unto a siely Maidens years:
Which to abridge least she do long I fear.
For why the cause of this my languor lurckes
And hidden lies by Physic not recurde,
So meager am I woxe, so lean and bare,
As scarce I had suffising force to write,
With leaning on mine Elbowe able scarce
My pined limbs and carcass pale to raise.
Now dread I least beside my Beldame Nurce
Some one discrie our entercomoning.
Tofore the gate she sittes, to askers how
I fare (that I may write) she says I sleep.
But when within a space fuspected is
Excessive sleep, and slumber ouerlong,
And such she sees repair whom to debar
Were duresse: then she spits and gives a hemme,
A feygned sign that some is at the door.
I leave my lines imperfect then for have,
And to my bosom thrust the scrolle eftsoone,
Forth with in speed I plie the same again,
And set my hand and pen to former task.
Which thing how yrksome toil it was to me,
Thy self may well discern, and be the judge.
Which thou (in faith) have passing ill deserude.
But thy merits and just deserved hire
My ruthful clemency shall far surmount.
By thee, uncertain of dispayred health,
So often by thy deceit I have, and yet
Endure tormenting fittes and troublous teene.
This is the good my vaunted beauty gains
So often extolde by thee above the stars.
It me annoyes thee to have likte so well.
If in thy sight I had deformed been,
(Which rather I could wish) my blamed corpse
In need of Phisicks help had never stood.
Now being praysde I mourn by your discord
Betrayde: my proper good does forge my woes.
Whilst thou do scorn to yield, and he repines
To lose his room or be in second place,
Thou barrste his wish, and he does hinder thine,
I like a ship am tossed, whom Boreas blast
Into the Channel drives, but surge and tide
Repelles to shore, from deeper foorde again.
And of my Parents when the wished day
Arriues, excessive heates my limbs besiedge,
And at the cruel marriage day, my doors
In yrefull rage Proserpina does shake.
I blush and dread (though guiltless in my mind)
Least I by ought have stirrde the Gods to wrath.
Some plead it commes by hap, and some surmise
This man to be dislikte of heavenly powers,
And fame of thee has also her report:
Some deem it done by my inchauntments eke:
The cause is hid: my hurtes too plain appear.
Ye wage a restless war and endelesse strife:
But I mean while am she that bide the smart.
I now will say as I was wont of yore,
By loving if thou thus annoy thy love,
How would thou hurt by hate the hated thing?
If whom thou love thou hurt, go love thy foe,
Wish me full ill to fare, and save my life.
Or now of hoped spouse thou have no carke,
Whom vndeserude, thou ruthlesse lettste to pine:
Or if in vain thou to the Goddess sue,
To me why do thou so auaunt thy self
That stand naught in Dians grace at all?
Say what thou will, thou will not swage her ire,
I clean am out of thought: thou can not, thou
Appease the Goddess, thou art quite forgot.
Or would I never had, or notas then
Delos (that is inuironde withthe Sea,
Aegaeum) known: a hapless I Will to me.
Tho was my ship to surging Channel brought
Vnluckely, sinister was the hour
Wherein I shoope to take the cursed Seas.
How set I forth my foot? from Threshold with
What foot went I? or to my painted Barck
With what unlucky foot did I repair?
Yet twice with froward winds my ship recoylde,
And made retoure to shore: but oh I lie,
That wind was blissful and no froward gale:
A blessed blast that brought me back to baye,
And went about to bar my hapless course.
And would it had contended with my sails,
And stood in longer strife and greater war.
But folly is the fickle winds to blame.
Mooude with the place his fame, and fresh report,
To Delos I my hasty voyage shoope:
And in a nymble Barck did pass the flood.
How often did I control the sluggish Oars,
Complaining that the sail clothes did not strout
But flagging flue, not stuffed with gladsome gale?
Now Mycone, Tenos, and Andros I
Had past, and Delos was discouerde plain.
Which when I scride afar. I Will why (quouth I)
Do thou me flee? Where yet (as erst thou did)
Doste thou in largie Seas and Channel rode
Aye fleering to and fro? I came to land
When day was put to flight, and Phoebus began
His weary steedes from purple wheels discharge
Whom when he had to wonted rising brought,
Again at morn (my Mather giving charge)
My comely tresses were in order laid,
And frisled locks in brauest manner trimde.
Her self bespangde my hands with curious Ge^mes,
And purlde my hair with gold: her self applide
Unto my shoulders vesture passing fine.
Then yssuing out to Rulers of the I Will
And sacred Gods incense with wine we gave.
And whilst my Mother with her vowed blood
The Altar stains, and Bowels broils on coals
In ranges casting Fume to lofty skies:
The busy careful Nurce led me about
From place to place, from Church to sacred Fane:
In Porches now I pass, now musing at
The gifts of kings, and sundry sightes I saw.
Then gasting on the Altars made with horns
And tree, against which the wandering Goddess at
Her time of bearing child did rest her corse:
And what beside (for I ne all to mind
Can call, or lawful is I say, to tell)
Was to be seen in dainty Delos tho.
Whilst I (Aconce) of these so straungie sightes
Was taking vewe thou me perhaps discridste:
Who for so simple was, and void of fraud,
Did sitting seem to be entrapt of thee.
By steps I came into a stately Church
Where Dian was: might any place more safe
Or sicker be than where the Goddess stood?
Tofore my feet the trilling Apple came
Gliding on paued ground whereas I sat,
Having this verse ingraude. (Aye me well nigh
I had to thee another Hest ymade)
Which Beldame Nurce took up, and said (behold)
Where I thy craft (O noble Poet) read.
The name of marrige read, blushing I felt
My changed cheeks to glow with sudden flash.
In bosom fired fast mine eyes I held,
Mine eyes that workers were of thine intent.
Unthrift, why doste thou joy? what glory have
Thou gainde? what praise shall you (a man) atchieue
By craft one sielie Virgin to devour?
Not I in armor cladde with Pollare stood
As ventrous Penthesilea did at Troie:
No Belt with Amazonian gold beset
Thou me have reft, as Queen Hippolyte was.
Why leapst thou so for joy? in that thy words
Have fowly me beguilde, and I by dole
And subtle slight, a siely Nymph was taken?
Cydip an Apple took, Atlanta did
The like: another Hippomenes now thou art.
More better were it if thou had been thrall
Unto the Boy, who has by thy report
(I wot not well) what flaming fiery brands.
After the guife of honest wightes (by fraud
Not to fordoe thy hope) I rather was
To been entreated, than by craft intrapt.
Why thou ne me displaydst in time of suit
Such things as I in thee should have belikte?
Why rather to enforce, than to persuade
Me did thou choose, if thy condition read
By me had power to make the bargain sure?
What now to thee auailes the former oath,
And Goddess pressed for erue record appealde
With tongue? it is the mind that makes the hest
(Wherewith I never swear) it only adds
Faith to the words, and makes the stable oath.
It is pretenced mind and purpose set
That binds the bargain sure: no band auailes,
Or is of force without consenting thought.
If so it were my will to join with thee,
Then spare thou not to claim thy marrige right.
But if I spoke the word and meant it not,
The forcelesse words and nothing else thou against,
I swear not, but pronounst the words of oath.
I must not so select thee for my spouse.
Guile other so, certes if that be good
And take effect, the rich man's wealth bereave,
Procure that Princes swear that thou shall have
Their Scepters, and their sovereign seats possess,
And let be thine what so the world enioyth.
In faith thou do surpass Diana far,
If that thy letters have in them inrolde
Such present Godhead and auayling power.
Yet when I have thus said, and flat affirmde
Me not to be thy spouse, and pleaded have
My promise in best form that ever I may:
I grant, I dread Dianas yrefull wrath,
Deeming from thence my grieful pangues to come,
That plague my wretched corse and limbs torment,
For why, as often as spousals are addressed,
Languish my limbs ransackt with deadly teene?
Thrice Hymen's clamor coming to mine ears
Fled from my chamber door, and did astart.
Scarce could he make th'infased flame to flashe,
Scarce would the stirred bronds and faggots burn.
Often sithes his head furnished with garlands gaye,
Anointed dropped, and often his Scarlet Robe
And costly vesture was in hand to d'on.
When he approcht the door, and wayling saw,
With flowing tears and fear of griesly death,
And other such abhorring his attire:
Straight from his forhead he the garlands floong,
And from his perfumde locks the Oil did wring.
Shaming with mirth amiddes so sad a route
To rushe, his garments hue his face distainde.
But miser I with Fevers am attachte,
And fry with durning fittes: my vestures are
More weighty than they shoulden weighty be.
Upon my cheeks I see my parents shower
Their drearie tears and saltish brine for woe,
And stead of marrige wa^d, deaths brond appears.
Thou Goddess that in quiuers doste rejoice,
And bended bow, favor a sickly Nymph,
And lend me now thy skillful Brothers help,
To rid my corse of this my vexing smart.
It Is shame for thee that he abandons grief,
And thou doste seek the title of my death.
Where I unawares approached have the place,
Whilst you did bathe thy chastfull limbs in ford?
Have I, of all the Gods thy Altars left
And ouerpast withouten sacrifice?
Or did my Dame the Lady Mother scorn?
I not aguilt, save that I periure radde,
And skillful was in an unlucky verse.
Do thou (unless thy love be feigned) cast
Incense for me into the flaming fire.
The hands that hurt, let them my help procure.
Why she that freates that I behight to thee
Am not thy spouse, makes that I can not be?
Hope well thou may whilst yet I live and breath:
But (cruel) why bereues she me my life,
And thee dispoyles of thy well hoped boon?
Surmise not him whose wife I am assignde
And lotted spouse, my payned limbs to touch
And feel with griping hand. Certes he sittes
Him down by me, as lawful is to do,
Minding my coutch to be a Maidens lodge.
And I wot near what he does judge of me.
For often (the cause unknown) he baynes his breast
With showers of trickling tears: Not ouerbolde
He coyes me, and does seldom kiss among,
Whispering with fearful voice, that I am his.
Ne marvel I if he discrie my mind,
That do my self so openly bewraye.
When he repayres, I wrie me round about,
And use no words, but winking feign to sleep,
Shunning his fist that would me gladly touch.
He mournes and draws his sighs from silent breast,
And not aguilting has my high disdain.
More justly thou that laughste at my distress,
And pleasure takste therein (If I could spoake
And use my tongue) should my ill will acquire,
And have my hate, that such a Panther pight,
By letter leave and license thou do crave
To see my wretched plight, and feebled corse:
Far off thou makste abode, and yet annoyst.
I not a little maruailde that thy name
Acontius was: in deed thou have an edge
So sharp as far can lend a lurching wound.
I scarce am yet recured of the hurt,
Me like a Dart thy lines have scarde aloof.
Why would thou hither come? a wretched corse
(Thy double spoil committed) may thou see.
My flesh is fallen away, my color fled
And bloudlesse is my face, a semblaunt hue
(As I remember) had the subtle fruit.
In visage wanne no scarlet read appears.
Of Marble picture hewn but of late
Such is the form: Such is the siluers hue
At bankets that with chilly water touched
In Basan cast, is pale for deadly cold.
If now thou sawste me, thou would quite deny
Me erst with eye of thine to have been seen.
And say: by Art and subtle slight, in sooth
She not deserude to been atchiude of me:
Sending me back (for fear I should by oath
In marrige shocke with thee) my plighted Hest:
Desirous that Diana would forget
And clean put from her thought the bargain made,
Procuring eke perhaps contrary oath
And quite repugnant to my former vow,
Sending a novel verse for me to vewe.
Yet naythelesse (as thou have longed erst)
I would thou sawste thy Miser spouses plight,
And limbs with lanquor passingly oppressed.
(Aconce) more harder than the stubborn steel
Though be thy ruthlesse breast, yet pardon thou
In my behalf would purchase me I know.
To show the mean how I may be recurde
And come by health again. At Delphos is
A God forespeaking things that are to come,
Displaying future fates, his counsel seek.
He eke (as whispring fame does fly) complains
Of one (I wot nere whom) that broken has
And scornde a promise made before record.
This both the God, the Prophet, and my verse
Declare, thy vow does want no verse his aid
Such favor how should thou procure? unless
Some letter late deuisde by thee, the haulte
And stately Gods had taken? Since you doste stand
In grace and favor of the Gods so great,
I will ensue the name of heavenly powers,
And willing yield my hands unto thy Hest.
Unto my Dame by my unwitting tongue
Of plighted promise I have made a show:
She down to ground her blushing cou^tnance cast.
Look what remains be thine the care and charge,
More than a virgin should (in that my hand
Dradde not to write these lines to thee) I did
Now long enough my sickly corse with quill
Molested is, my pained hand denies
A farther duty: What remains there now,
(Save that I long to lincke my self with thee)
For these my lines, but thee to bid adue?
The Argument of the reply to the first Epistle, entitled Ulysses to Penelope.
Ulysses having thoroughly scand
The earnest verse his wife did write:
Thought good and needful out of hand
Her loving letters to requite:
What so she did object to him,
The Greek reaunswerde very trim.
He quittes himself of all such blame
As by his wife imputed was:
He tells his worthy feats of fame,
And perils that he chaunst to pass,
And how the Prophet willde the Squire
In beggars habit to retire,
And that his wife alone should know
Her husband that disguisde him so.
Ulysses Reply to Penelopes Epistle.
Unto Ulysses miser wight
good hap at length has brought
The loving lines (Penelope)
thy hand in tables wrought.
I knew thy friendly fist at first
and tokens passing well:
They were a comfort to my woes,
and did my sorrows quell.
Thou blamest me of retchlesse sloth,
more better were perhaps
To linger, than to wrie my woes,
and tell thee afterclaps.
Greece blamde me not for that ywis,
when I a fury fainde,
And made as though I had been mad
with thee to have remainde.
The earnest love to thee (sweet heart)
and to thy bed I bare,
Procurde me tho so like a mad
and Bedlam wight to fare.
Thou would not have me write a whit,
but hasten home a pace:
Lo, when I think to come, my sails
the froward winds do chase.
I loyter not in Troie, a Town
of Greekish Gyrles defide:
For Troie is now to cynders come,
suppressed is her pride.
Deiphobus is flaine, with stern
Hector, and Asius eke:
And who so else did breed thy fear
is conquerde by a Greek.
I scapte the Thracian furious fights,
and having Rhesus flaine,
Upon the captive chiuals came
into my Tents again.
And safe from Pallas sacred Church
I stole, and did conuaye
The fatal Relic of the Town
Palladium away.
Nor in the horse his hollow womb
and belly I adrad:
Although Cassandra (Trojans) cryde
burn, burn as she were mad.
Burn, in this feigned timber frame
the wily Greeks do lurcke:
That seek this day poor Trojans fall
and latter bane to work.
Achylles honor of his grave
and Tomb was like to lack:
Had I to Thetis not conuaide
Achylles on my back.
Ne did the Greeks (I thank them) grutch
with praise my pains to pay:
I had the Armor of the corpse
that I had taken away.
But what auailes it? now it is drownde,
I have nor ship yleft,
Nor Mates alive: the swalowing Goulfe
has every whit bereft.
Thy only love that part has taken
with me of all my pain,
As only fellow of my fates
does aye with me remain.
Not ravening Syllas wawghing whelps
could force him to depart,
Ne yet Charybdis churlish Channel,
pluck him from my heart.
Not fierce Antiphates, nor yet
Parthenope the trull,
With sweet deceytfull Sirens songs
from me this love could pull,
Not Circe, nor Calypfo though
by Magic Art they wrought:
And the one to bring me to her bent
by mean of marrige thought.
I had them both by promise bound
that they would take away
My mortal twist, and teach me to
King Plutos Court the way
But I, not forcing of their gifts
did love my wedlock best:
Although perhaps in seeking thee
I shall be sore distressed.
But thou perchance such dainty dames
suruaying in my write:
Impaciently wilt read the reast,
and be in cholar quite.
What I with Circe had to do
or fair Calypso, thee
Will aye procure a (fearful wench)
in doubtful dumps to be.
In faith when I Antinous name,
and Polybus did read,
With Medon: I amazed was,
and overcome with dread.
Amid so many lusty Laddes
and Tossepots to be chaste?
Alas, what should I think herein?
I am full sore agaste.
Why, if thou shed thy tears so fast,
should any leake thy face?
What? have not yet those trickling tears
beat beauty out of place?
Beside, thou have behight to wedde
when twist is all ysponne:
And all in fear thou do untwist
as fast as thou begone.
A good deceyte. But take good heed
least whilst with such a wile
Thou do thy suitors eyes deceive,
thy self thou not beguile,
Ah (Polyphem) I rather wish
within thy den to have
Been murthred, and my woeful days
yfinisht with the grave:
Yet rather had I conquerde, and
of Thracian sword been flaine,
What time the wandering Barges did
in Ismaron remain:
Or that I had the greedy jaws
replenisht with my blood,
Of hungry Helhounde, when I went
down to the Stygian flood.
Where I (thou wrotste not of it) saw
my Mother, well at ease
That was when I departed from
thy coast, and took the Seas.
She told me of the house his evils:
and thrice she fled me fro,
As I with reaching arms did catch
more news of her to know.
Sir Protesilaus I discride,
that forcing not a pin
The Prophets words, to fling the flame
to Troie did begin.
A happy and a blessed man,
for with him went his wife
With laughing brows: that for his sake
forsook her loathsome life
For Lachesis the Goddess had
her twist not thoroughly spoonne:
It did her good unto her spouse
before her time to roonne:
I saw (but oh with flowing tears
that gusht on either cheek)
Duke Agamemnon lately slain,
a thrice renoumed Greek.
He never took that hurt at Troie,
untouched he went his way
Through spiteful Nauplius secret snares,
that in Euboea lay.
But what did that avail the wight?
for when he surely thought
Returned to pay his due to Jove
this beastly death he cought.
This was the guerdon Helen had
provided for the man,
In stead of better present when
she with the stranger ran.
Ah, how could I rejoice to see
sir Hectors sister, and
His wife among thy other thrauls
and Teucrian trulls to stand?
I could the aged Hecuba had
and used her in bed,
That thy mistrustfull mind I might
beguilde, and ielous head,
That would have thought thy husband had
of no such piece ben sped.
She gave the first abodement fell
that on my ships should light:
Whom there I saw not with her parts
and woonted members dight.
Her bitter plaintes and woeful cries
a howling did pursew:
She was become a very Curre
in every part to view.
Dame Thetis musing at the sight,
turmoylde the quiet flood:
And Aeole gave his blustering winds
in charge to blow a good.
From that time Miser I was driven
to wander in the Seas,
And follow every flood and flaw,
too cruel things to please.
But if Tyresias be as true
in telling of good haps,
As erst he was in making show
of evil forepassed claps:
Now misaduentures are ypast
by land and sowfing wave,
I hope I shall retire to Greece,
some better luck to have.
Now Pallas undertaken has
as following Mate to me,
To safe conduct me to the lodge
where I do long to be.
I never saw her from the time
of Troies latter wrack,
Till now the wronged Goddess has
from anger been alack.
What so Oenides did, it lights
upon us all aleeke:
Upon the Greeks from man to boys
reuengement she did seek.
Not thee (good Diomed) she sparde
whose armor known was:
She has enforst thee Miser eke
through many broils to pass.
Nor him that Telamon begat
upon a captive Less:
Nor him that with a thousand ships
to wreake his wrong did pass.
Plisthenides, thou were yblest,
what fortune so befell:
For aye thy wedlock went with thee,
whom thou did love so well.
And whether winds did breed thy stay,
or surging Seas annoide;
Thou did by mean of mutual love
incroching cares avoid.
Nor blustering blastes, nor troublous tide
from kissing thee dismayde:
With clinching arms thou her imbraste,
and never were afraid.
Oh that I might not wander so,
(sweet wench) thou would procure
The surge seem calm, with thee I should
no deadly smart endure.
No sooner I had tidings that
Telemach was alive,
But that the news forepassed griefs
from gladsome mind did drive.
Whose going again by tossing floods
in weak and rotten Barck
To Pylos and to Sparta, did
reduce my former carck.
That love deserves no thancke in deed
wherein such peril is:
And when you let him go to Sea
you did not well ywis.
But all the broyle will be at last,
the Prophet said I should
At length embrace thy friendly corse
as I had done of old.
Whom thou alone shall know, but then
take heed and well beware,
That other by your gesture learn
not why so glad you are.
I must not deal with force of hand
or as an open foe,
The Prophet said that to foretell
Apollo bid him so.
I shall perhaps devise the time,
to be awroken fit,
With bow in hand to rushe me in
when they at tables sit.
And then perchance they marvel will
me hateful man to see:
Oh Gods, when will that day come on
and pleasant hour be,
Wherein I may renew again
the sweet delights ypast:
And thou begin to repossesse
thy loving spouse at last?
The Argument of the reply to the second Epistle, entitled Demophoon to
Phyllis.
HErein his treason and delay
Demophoon minded to deface,
That had ybe^ne so long away
from friendly Phyllis noble grace:
Sometime upon his Countrie^ men
the lingering Lover lays the blame:
On perilous passage now and then,
and lack of wind he cast the same;
But last in spite of wave and wind
he made her promise to reuart:
And so he did, in hope to find
the Queen as when he did depart.
But oh, impacient of her panges,
that she had for her guest sustainde,
In Almon tree good Phyllis hanges,
and this was all the Hostess gainde.
Demophoons Reply to Phyllis Epistle.
EVen from his Country soil
Demophoon wrytes to thee:
His Country (Phyllis) that he minds
thy grateful gift to be.
Demophoon is not linckt
with any novel Less:
But not so happy as with thee
acquainted well he was.
Duke Theseus, of whom
thou ever stoodste in awe,
(Which made perhaps thy flame the more)
to be thy Fatherlawe:
(A shameful thing for me
to suffer such a deed)
By cruel foe was reft his reign:
this was old ages meede.
Even he that whileome had
Amazons courage quaylde,
A mate for Hercules that so
in armor had preuaylde,
Even he that Mynos made
a father of a foe,
Amazde to see his monstrous Beast
by valiance conquerde so.
I am accusde to been
the cause of his exile,
My brother lays it to my charge,
I must not plead the while.
Whilst thou (quoth he) did fond
on Phyllis, and did crave
By earnest suit unto thy wife
a foreign wench to have:
The slipper time did pass
with hasty foot away,
Thy loytring was the cause that thou
doste see this doolefull day.
Thou moughtst perhaps at first
this wicked stir have stayde:
At least, though matters had been past,
thou moughtst have been an aid.
But Rhodopeian Reign
I better did esteem:
And of a Nymph, whom better than
her Scepter I did deem.
Then Athamas gins to chaufe,
and thundering words bestows:
And Aethra harpes upon the same,
a crooked piece God knows.
She says my lingering was
the occasion that her son
Could not shut up his mothers eyes
as duty was to done.
I can not it deny
they both excladme a good,
And cryde on me when that my ship
rode on the Thracian flood.
Demophoon (quoth they)
why stayste thou lingering so?
The wind does serve: home to thy Gods,
and native Country go.
Let Phyllis myrror be
whom thou do love so well:
She fancies thee, but loath she is
for thee her Realm to sell.
She craves thee to retire,
thy journey Mate to be
She scorns: more than thy Reign she ways
her barbarous soil we see.
But I in silence would
amid their brawles (I mind)
A thousand thanks bestow atonce
upon the blustering wind.
And when I should depart,
embracing Phyllis hard,
I ioyde with all my heart to see
how dashing waters warrde.
Ne would I fear the same
before my Sire to vaunt:
For by thy meritts I attainde
my liberty I grant.
Thou must of force confess
that with no steely heart
I went my way, nor in post haste
thy Country did depart.
I sobbde and weeping thee
to solace made a stay,
When to forgo thy friendly shore
was come the fired day.
I clambe the Thracian Bark,
and took my ship in deed:
When Phyllis bid it should not over
hastily proceed.
Forgive since I confess,
your self remember well
King Mynos daughter in your breast,
that ancient love does dwell.
As often as my Sire
to Skieward looks: he says,
She whilome was my loving wench
that has those glistring rays.
God Bacchus bid him leave
and yield him up the Maid:
But he (goodman) sustaines the blame,
they say he her betrayde.
By his example I
a periurde man am thought:
Ne doste thou (cruel Phyllis) ask
the cause mine absence wrought.
Ne thinckst thou it enough,
or able to requight
My former fault, that I am not
in love with any wight.
Why ( Phillis) have thou not
heard of the cruel fate
Of Theseus Palace? of his house?
and lamentable state?
Have thou not tidings that
my fathers death I wayle?
A farther grief than fathers fall
Demophoon does assail
Not of Hippolyts hap?
he miserable man
Fell headlong from the fearful steedes
that down the Mountain ran.
I seek not to excuse
my lingering, though there be
A thousand cares that heap my hoe,
I ask a space of thee.
Let me or ere I come
lay Theseus in his grave,
And see that he who was my Sire
his burial rites may have.
Give space and leave I pray,
not like a Traitor I
Absent me: than thy soil I know
not safer where to lie.
Since Troie went to wrack,
and battayles broyle did stay,
What ease so ere I felt at Sea
or otherwhere: I say
I had it all in Thrace,
(yet there I found some grief)
that only soil unto my woes
was succor and relief.
And is, if thou be one,
and be not mooude awhight,
That now I have a stately house
so Castleyke in sight:
Nor that my Fathers happes
or Mothers shameful fate,
Or these my ill successes cause
thy fancy to rebate.
What if I went to Troie
in marriage linckt with thee?
And thou thy husband waging war
full ten years space should see?
Thou hearste Ulysses wife
what honor she has got:
A myrrour she became, for that
she liude withouten blot.
Who (by report) deuisde
a charitable wile
In sprinning: wherewithal her instant Suitors to beguile.
For whatsoever she
by day in sight had wrought:
At night the self same twisted twine
from thread to wool she brought.
But Phyllis you do fear
your Suitors will be gone
That profferde wedlock erst in Thrace:
canste thou with any one,
Or haste thou heart to match
thy self in bridely band?
What? will not fear of broken Hest
thy shameful act withstand?
O Lord how thou will blush,
O Lord how thou will shame,
When thou shall view my sails aloof
and know they be the same?
Thou then wilt blame thy rash
complaint (but all too late)
And say: Demophoon was to me
a true and faithful Mate.
Demophoon is retirde
that Southren blast abidde,
And cruel tempest, whilst upon
the sowsing seas he slidde.
Ah, why in such post haste
did I this blame devise?
I broken have my plighted Hest,
which makes my heart agrise.
But (oh) go forward so
more rather than to me
(Sweet Phyllis) greater grief and care
should chance again by thee.
What Gibbet (oh) is that
that thou do manace so
Unto thy self, and froward sat
to work thy waylfull woe?
The Gods that in this soil do dwell
are ouerbolde I trow.
I pray thee spare, and cause
no more defame to spring
From out our race: whose traitrous crime
too loud a Bell does ring.
Ariadne may excuse
my Father since her lotte
Was party cause she was forlorn.
who me may justly blotte?
Now self same winds my words
that did my sails convey:
I would return with all my heart
but have good cause to stay.
The Argument of the reply to the fifth Epistle, entitled Paris to Oenone.
THe lines that Oenon sent
When Paris had perusde,
And saw thereby she meant
That she was quite refusde,
Of him that had conuayde from Greece
Fair Helena that passing piece:
He wrote in this effect,
And flat at first began tell,
That when he did reject
The Nymph, he did not well:
But therewithal he laid the blame
On Cupid that procurde the same.
He makes her open show,
How stately was the stroke,
Of blinded Cupids bow,
And how he brought to yoke
Both man and God, and did not let
To say that Destnies so had set.
Paris Reply to Oenons Epistle.
SO lawefull is thy plaint
(O Nymph) as I confess,
My hand does hunt for current terms
my meaning to express,
It hunts and can not find,
I feel my guilt so great:
I would recant, but (oh) the same
my novel love does let.
My conscience me condempnes
if thou not angry be
Therewith: but what? in cause I know
thou may not match with me.
For me whom thou do blame,
Cupido to his reign
Has forced to yield: another pray
even so I now remain.
Thou were my wedlock first,
I grant it true to be
That I in greenish years my love
and faith behight to thee.
Ne was I then so proud
as in your Letters you
Objected me: ne I my self
king Priams noorie knew.
Deiphobus not I
nor Hector thought to be
My brothers when I fed my flock
in Ida Mount with thee.
Not Hecuba I knew
but by a Mothers name:
And thou did well deserve to had
her aye to been thy Dame.
But Love from Reason swarues,
thy self shall judge the case:
For thou art wrongde, and having wrong
do love me naythelasse.
And whereas Panes thee,
and Satyrs did desire:
Thou shoonste their love, and aye in mind
do keep thy former fire.
Beside, this latter love
was furthred by the fate:
My sister eke Cassandra saw
of future things the state:
Not I as then had heard
the brute of Helens name:
Ne to mine ears by her report
the Greekish tumult came.
You see that all is true,
my guilte does sole remain:
And to request your pardon I
in humble wise am feign.
Within thy power does reast
the doom of life and death:
Now bind me thine for evermore
by saving of my breath.
Thou weptst (I mind it well)
and yet thou sangst withal:
And said, God shilde that no such evil
at any time befall.
No though his deeds deserve
and every thing beside:
Yet Oenon I to work his bane
will never be discride.
Oh pardon: selfsame love
that forgde this fraud to thee,
Made me to think herein not half
so many fears to be.
That God does strike the stroke:
Sometime into a Bull
He Jove conuerts, into a Foul
sometime to coy his trull.
Not Helen now in earth
so passing goodly Dame
Had been, (at wench by nature made
to set my breast in flame)
Had not the mighty Jove
become a Swanne in sight:
That erst a golden shattering shower
on Danaes lap did light.
A feigned Foul sometime
in Ida Mount did sore:
Sometime amids Agenors neat
in form of Bull did rore.
Alcydes who would think
the valiant man to have
Ysat at distaffe? Love did make
him twisten like a slave.
Again the man was seen
in Ioles garment clad:
And she the hairie Lions case
upon her shoulders had.
And Oenon thou (I mind)
(I touch my self too nie)
The God Apollo scorndste, and did
to Paris mind aplie.
Not for I him excellde,
but Cupid wild it tho
That in such sort his subtle shafts
in Oenons breast should go.
But comfort thou thy wrong,
in that thy ryuall she
A passing wench, and daughter brave
to Jove is known to be.
But that she came of Jove
it moves me not a mite:
But (oh) her face is passing fair,
it is it that works the spite.
And (O) I wish that I
a skillesse Judge had bin,
When to (...) beauties pride
the Ladies did begin.
For then not Iunos ire
nor Pallas wrathful breast
Should hurt me ought, for liking of
the Lady Venus best.
She Cupids flames deuids,
and franckly fire on those
(By even and odd, by quick and slow)
on whom she list bestows.
Yet neither she her self
those weapons could avoid:
The Bow she bare for other, has
her proper breast annoyde.
For halting Vulcan grutcht
when he by fortune found
The warlike God and her in bed,
and caused to resounde
His woeful plaint before the Gods,
and Jove that saw them bound.
And mighty Mauors now
laments and lowres as fast:
For she has fled this soil, and of
Anchises is imbrast.
Now wholly she delights
Anchises eye to leake:
To him alone she closely clings,
and gives the reast the gleake,
What wonder was that she
should have the power to aid
Those egall flames of love, whose fire
poor Paris has assayde?
Whom Menelaus wrongde
does love, I fancide well
Not wrongde at all: beside she matched
with one wrongde near a dell.
And I perceive it plain
that for this rape there arre
Revenger Greeks with wreakfull ships
to bid the Trojans war.
The goodness of the cause
(I nothing doubt) will be
Allowde: to forcen Dukes to fight
her features are we see.
If me you not believe,
behold the Chieftaine Greeks
In Armor: I must hold her fast
whom they so sorely seeks.
But if you stand in hope
by force to wrest my will,
Why cease your herbs and Magike Verse?
where is thy woonted skill?
For in Apollos Art
thou can as much as she
That is the best, the truest dreams
of Hecate thou do see.
I well remember thou
have fet the Moon aback:
And stayde the Stars, and dimde the day
with duske and cloudie black.
I fed the frowning Bulls,
and maruelde much to see
Amid the Heirde by Oenons charms
the Lions tame to be.
Of Xanthus what should I,
or Simoys now report?
Or tell how both those streams were stayde
by thee in monstrous sort?
Thy Sire him self in fear
his daughter farde amiss,
Amid his waters all bewitched
would often stay ywisse.
Now (Oenon) here is place,
do what thou can by skill:
Or quench thy flames, or clean put out
my brande that blazeth still.
FINIS.
The Translator to the captious sort of Sycophants.
THe Ploughman hopes in recompense of toil.
And winters travail past, to reap the grain
That he (goodman) has sown on his soil,
With great increase of crop and goodly gain:
And reason good why so he should in deed,
For he thereon long erst bestowde his seed.
The fearful Fisherman that castes his Net
In haven mouth, and lays his bayted hooks,
Does trust at length by happy hap to get
Such store of fish as may suffice the Cooks,
And Caters eke, and bring him in the mucke
That ventred life in hope of happy luck.
If Ploughman then and Fisher gape for gaynes,
And hope assuredly to have the same,
To quite there troublous toils, and daily pains
Endurde ere they could bring their feats to frame:
why should not such as climb the craggie Mount
Where Muses won, of earned hyre account?
And look for laud at least at learned hands,
That know the cares of undertaken works,
And wot full well how hie Pernasus stands
With stately steps, where Poets Laurel lurkes:
A haughty hill that every wight must clime
Ere he attain with Poets pen to rhyme.
For though the thing but slender be in sight,
And vain to vewe of curious carping skull,
In mother tongue a foreign speech to write:
Yet he shall find he has a Crow to pull,
That undertakes with well agreeing File
Of English verse, to rub the Roman style.
Devises of the language diverse are,
Well couched words, and feately forged phrase,
Each string in tune, no ragged ryme does jar,
With figures fraught their books in every place:
So that it is a work of praise to cause
A Roman borne to speak with English jaws.
Which laud I leave, and praise to paynefull men
That have with nightly sweat of busy browe
Set out their works of fame with forward pen:
For this my Muse I would accoumpt ynowe
To escape the spiteful Zoyles chiding chaps,
That (like a Curre) each willing writer snaps.
So I might go untouched of Momus train,
And never feel the force of envious Hate,
Sufficed me, well quitted were my pain,
I might be thought a man of luckie fate.
But, oh, it can not be, the best of all
(That Homer hight) to nipping nails was thrall.
But let those Snakes, and beastly Vipers brood
(I mean the spiteful Spider, Momus mate)
When they have done, recoumpt their gotten good,
They gain ywis but scorn and loathsome hate:
Wherefore depart the rack thou Curre (I say)
And let the lusty Courser champe the hay.
If thou thy self for kimpish idle life
No leisure have to take in hand the like,
But kepste thy Couch: put up that cankred knife
Wherewith thou wonted art the good to strike:
Let other press in place to purchase fame,
For virtues sake that work to win a name.
Discern their deeds, when all their toil is done,
Say thou thy worst, when they have done their best:
Condemn them not or ere thou have begone
To vewe their works, but ouerreade the rest:
That done, let each sustain his earned meede,
This were the way to purchase love in deed.
