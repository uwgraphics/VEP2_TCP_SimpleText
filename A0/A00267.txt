before they shall receive, so that it be before the beginning of Morning
prayer, so many of them, as intend to receive, and not only to signify unto
you their names, to the intent ye may keep a Register or note of all such
persons as from time to time shall communicate, but also to be by you examined,

Faith, the Lords prayer, and the Catechism, according as after the diversity
of their ages is above required, and such of them as either can not, or will
not recite the same by heart unto you, ye shall repel and put back from the
holy Communion, until they shall be able and willing to learn, and can by
heart recite the same unto you: for your better assistance wherein, ye shall

may help to put this good order in practice, and ye shall take a note of such

Ordinary if they shall refuse so to assiste you.
