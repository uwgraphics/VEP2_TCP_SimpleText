With pleasing smelling and tasting,
Crying out of Spendthrisfts wasting.

Blind Fortune following after,
Maued a hearty laughter,
To see polt-footed Vulcan,
Tosting off many a full can,
and singing the new found deedle, etc.
Mercury, Mars, and Venus,
So witty and engenious,
Brought in the young god Cupid
To jeere at poor mortals so stupid,
for learning the new found deedle,
o this my Grannams deedle,
the Mammy and Daddies deedle,
a merry conceited deedle.
