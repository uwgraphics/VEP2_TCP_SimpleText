THE FIRST SET OF MADRIGALS AND PASTORALS of 3.4 and 5. Parts.

NEWLY COMPOSED by FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Bachelor of Music and Lutenist; and
one of the Cathedral Church of Christ and blessed Mary the Virgin in Chester.

LONDON: Printed for M. L. I. B. and T. S. the Assigns of W. Barley. 1614.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, Sir Thomas Smith of Hough, in the County of
Chester, Knight; Francis Pilkington Bachelor of Music, and Lutenist, wishes
all happiness in this life, and eternal felicity in the life to come.
RIght Worshipful, there is held an infallible opinion, that the sacred Art of
Music (being chiefly illustrated by Voices) notwithstanding all Artists, in
respect of the compass and quality of voices and instruments, do limit it
within scales and other certain dimensions, is in it own nature INFINITE;
reaching from the base Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the
highest E. LA. of the incomprehensible heavens: For demonstration whereof, GOD
to his great Glory, does diversely and wonderfully enable his creatures
thereunto, teaching man upon earth, not only in mellifluous Notes to chant;
but also upon variety of Instruments sweetly to express the hidden secrets of
that sacred Science, and not leaving the vast Air empty of his glory; he
instructs the early Lark to warble forth his praise; who, (as some hold)
learneth his lays from the musical motions of the heavenly Spheres, and from
thence to transcend up to the seat of the most highest, the elected Saints and
Angels do in heavenly Himmes, sing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinity,
sitting on the Throne of most Maiesticke glory.

In which quality of Music (Right worshipful) having spent a great part of
my time, I have now (after some others) of late produced this small piece of
work; which albeit for the insufficiency thereof, I do hold to be too
unworthy to be presented to your Worship, yet in regard of the many and
manifold favors, which I have received at your hands, and your exquisit skill,
both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I do presume to
tender it to your Patronage and protection, choosing rather to be censured for
ouer-boldnesse, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulness. And so
humbly desiring your Worship to accept of this, and to shield it from all
pragmaticall and stigmaticall detractors; until my best skill and endeavor,
shall incite my weak Muse to perform some work of better worth, I crave
pardon for my boldness, and commit your Worship and the good Lady your wife,
to the blessed tuition of the GOD of Israel.

From my mansion in the Monastery of Chester the 25. day of September 1612.
Your worships in all obseruancy Francis Pilkington.

RIght Worshipful, there is held an infallible opinion, that the sacred Art of

within scales and other certain dimensions, is in it own nature INFINITE;
reaching from the base Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the
highest E. LA. of the incomprehensible heavens: For demonstration whereof, GOD
to his great Glory, does diversely and wonderfully enable his creatures
thereunto, teaching man upon earth, not only in mellifluous Notes to chant;
but also upon variety of Instruments sweetly to express the hidden secrets of
that sacred Science, and not leaving the vast Air empty of his glory; he
instructs the early Lark to warble forth his praise; who, (as somehould)
learneth his lays from the musical motions of the heavenly Spheres, and from
thence to transcend up to the seat of the most highest, the elected Saints and
Angels do in heavenly Himmes, sing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinity,
sitting on the Throne of most Maiesticke glory.

In which quality of Music (Right worshipful) having spent a great part of
my time, I have now (after some others) of late produced this small piece of

unworthy to be presented to your Worship, yet in regard of the many and
manifold favors, which I have received at your hands, and your exquisit skill,

tender it to your Patronage and protection, choosing rather to be censured for

THE FIRST SET OF MADRIGALS AND PASTORALS of 3.4. and 5. Parts.

NEWLY COMPOSED by FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Bachelor of Music and Lutenist, and
one of the Cathedral Church of Christ and blessed Mary the Virgin in Chester.

LONDON: Printed for M. L. I. B. and T. S. the Assigns of W. Barley. 1614.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, Sir Thomas Smith of Hough, in the County of
Chester, Knight; Francis Pilkington Bachelor of Music, and Lutinest, wishes
all happiness in this life, and eternal felicity in the life to come.
RIght Worshipful, there is held an infallible opinion, that the sacred Art of
Music (being chiefly illustrated by Voices) notwithstanding all Artists, in
respect of the compass and quality of voices and instruments, do limit it
within scales and other certain dimensions, is in it own nature INFINITE;
reaching from the base Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the
highest E. LA. of the incomprehensible heavens: For demonstration whereof, GOD
to his great Glory, does diversely and wonderfully enable his creatures
thereunto, teaching man upon earth, not only in mellifluous Notes to chant;
but also upon variety of Instruments sweetly to express the hidden secrets of
that sacred Science, and not leaving the vast Air empty of his glory; he
instructs the early Lark to warble forth his praise; who, (as some hold)
learneth his lays from the musical motions of the heavenly Spheres, and from
thence to transcend up to the seat of the most highest, the elected Saints and
Angels do in heavenly Himmes, sing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinity,
sitting on the Throne of most Maiesticke glory.

In which quality of Music (Right worshipful) having spent a great part of
my time, I have now (after some others) of late produced this small piece of
work; which albeit for the insufficiency thereof, I do hold to be too
unworthy to be presented to your Worship, yet in regard of the many and
manifold favors, which I have received at your hands, and your exquisit skill,
both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I do presume to
tender it to your Patronage and protection, choosing rather to be censured for
ouer-boldnesse, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulness. And so
humbly desiring your Worship to accept of this, and to shield it from all
pragmaticall and stigmaticall detractors; until my best skill and endeavor,
shall incite my weak Muse to perform some work of better worth I crave
pardon for my boldness, and commit your Worship and the good Lady your wife,
to the blessed tuition of the GOD of Israel.
