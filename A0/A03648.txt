TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR EDWARD COKE KNIGHT, LORD Chief Justice of the
Common Plea's, all health and happiness in this world, and in the world to
come.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
HAVING spent some time in my Art of Geodetia, and Books of other matter,
dedicated to the right honorable, the Lord Treasurer, and other times in my
Topographicall Glass, to the right honorable, the Lord Chancellor: After (as
induced by complaint of some) I observed the inconveniences that happened to
the vulgar wits, and mean capacities in the calculation of the expiration of
time, by such Rules and Computations as be now extant, occasioned chiefly
thereunto by the partcipation of every one Regnall year, with two Ecclesian
years, because the year of any Prince his reign (as yet) began in one year
of our Lord, taking part of the same, ending in the next, and participating
likewise thereof; by which means, when a question is made by the Regnall year
only, the common doubt is to which year of our Lord it answers unto: or a
question being made by the year of our Lord, without mention of the Regnall
year, to know if it answer to the year of the King that did take beginning
or ending in the Eclesian year. All these, and many other doubts (which to
your Wisdom are trifles) unworthy the regard of such an ennobled spirit: yet
to such, whose understanding lives in a lower Region, amongst the mists and
clouds of ignorance: to these, and the common sort, may this book bring
benefit; for whose sake I have drawn new Tables and methods, which will be
much available to them, for whose sakes also I have calculated perpetual
Tables of the Terms and their Returns, guiding the same with a Decemnouenall
circle, as the Paschall Tables be. And lastly, have made a Prognostication,
exact, and ad minutum for 19. years, being referred to the Meridian of London,
and is perpetually more true then any ever yet extant, with other Astronomicall
Rules, and new Tables, general and necessary.

It rests then, that as your Lordship is Lex loquens, out of whose mouth like
Oracles proceed to posterities, that as you are a Lycurgus in prescribing Laws
for the Commonwealth, so you will be a Mecaenas in protecting literature for
their necessary use: That as you are a Cato in counselling for the good of all;
so you will be a Hercules in defending that which is for the gain of all.
Upon presumption whereof, I am bold to crave your noble patronage of this
little book, intended for the common good: and if time and health (to the
pleasure of God) permit opportunity, I will hereafter present you with a work
better beseeming your reading. In the mean time let me not be troublesome.
Although your Lordships mind be continually busied in matters of State; yet
sometimes let your eyes view trifles. We read of a noble Roman that could
both write, read, and answer petitions at once; which though he were an
admired Phoenix for his time, yet such that daily observe you upon your
Tribunal seat, reading Laws to some, pronouncing Judgment to others, and
hearing the complaints of all, have beheld you with like admiration: insomuch
that as we may wonder at the rareness of your gifts, so are we to pray for
your Lordships continuance in the place. But lest I prove troublesome, I end,
ever praying for your Honors prosperity, resting,

Your Honors ever devoted, ARTHVR HOPTON

To the Reader.
FRIENDLY Reader, oftentimes noting how much the Shepeheards Calendar, the
Perpetual Prognostication, and the Computation be required, and how false
their Astronomicall Rules and Tables be, for the true place of the Moon, for
her Conjunctions and Oppositions, with other things of like consequence, I
thought it fit (especially being entreated thereunto by a friend I well
esteemed) to draw a book that might pass under some of the former (or such
like) name, that should salve and correct those uncertain Tables (blots to the
Art, and blemishes of the truth) and also wholly to reject any of their
methods, drawing forth a work that might instruct the ignorant in the truth,
without intricate observations, and satisfy the vnlgar without difficult
calculations; and therefore have set down such Tables, such Documents, and
such Notations, that are easy to be understood, necessary to be known, and
aptly should agree with the volume. As for the Concordancy of Years, I know
certainly, that when you understand the true use thereof you will confess,
that it is far more easy, more true, and more profitable, then any book yet
extant of like purpose^ happily the newness of the method may seem strange to
the unlearned at first, but a little practice will soon persuade them the
contrary. The wants of the old Computation be a little remembered in my
Concordancy, not as if the Author thereof wanted understanding in that point,
for I suppose him right sufficient; but in that facilius est addere, quam nouum
componere: Yet I have borrowed nothing, but what is common to all: If any thing
be wanting, I wish you my further pains to supply it, and would have wrote
more, had I not feared to tire you with an ouer-great volume: But as it is, I
hope it will be offensive to none, since it is made for the good of all. And so
commending this work to them whose occasions tend that way, I end, resting

Yours to use, ARTHVR HOPTON.

Deplorati in^enij ho^ines; but that great Clarke M. I. Dee, long since,
promised his Apology. Notice, that the world has of him, proceeds for the
most part, from his Chy^ique doctrine, for which VVoarchadumists, and
Spagiristique writers commonly vouch him. But his works were diverse, both
Mathematical, Physical, and Theological. Of some of them Coppies are extant
in Peter-House, and Bennet College in Cambridge, some in private hands, and in
Panbrooke Hall Library, the Titles of some of his special treatises (not
mentioned by Bale or Gesner) De prolongatione vitae, Antidotarium cussdem, De
graduatione meduinarum, (in some of which I presume his report was of
Artephius, whom he affirmed to have, by art applied to nature, lived a thousand
years) remain in the Frontispice of a volume, the books themselves being
unhappily seized by plagiary Harpyes. And questionless spite and ignorance
(frequent enemies to learning and Art) have deprived posterity of no small
benefit by mis^censuring what they understood not. Howsoever in others, in this
learned Friar it has been too manifest, all whose works fairly written, and
well bound, were, by religious pretending Sciolists, d^^^'d as devilish, with

Limnocharis remissa, For his learning and gravity surnamed Presbyter
Venerabilis, borne at Iarrovv upon Tine, in the Bishopric of Durham, spent
his life in letters under Benedict, or Bennet, surnamed Bishop, an English
Gentleman of birth, and Abbot of VVeremouth (which founded that Abbey, and
another at Iarrovv, as one, and first of all brought builders of Stons-vvorke,
use of Glasse-vvindovves, Painting and such like into England from Rome,
whither he traveled five several times) and Ceolfrid his successor; wrote De

(with other old wives tales of them) at Boscham in Sussex, as, without warrant,

this subtle Doctor, Cardan and his most penetrating antagonist Scaliger,
enough blazon: nor do the Titles of Cainllationes, and Quisqui^ae S^icetica in
Vines, and Pic, Mirandula much detract from him. He was author of an
Ephemerides, and other of that nature, besides a book of the Art Cabalistique.
Oxford was his University, and under Ed. 3, as is thought was justly proved of

Chap. I. Of the Distinction of Creatures, and their respondency to the World.
THE everlasting God, as infinite in wisdom, as incomprehensible in power, the
only builder and maker of this wonderful and glorious frame of the World, has
likewise (by his most divine knowledge) created, and suffered man to perceive
three orders of creatures, all differing in themselves; which are corporal, as
the Clements; spiritual, as Angels; and compound, as Man: And these corporal
bodies are subdivided into bright and shining bodies, as Planets and Stars,
or into opacious and gross bodies, as the earth and metals, or into diaphane
and transparent bodies, as air and water; Or these kind of bodies some have
being only, as Stones; some, life and being, as Trees; some, sense, life and
being, as Beasts; and others, understanding, sense, life, and being, as Man,
which is most noble of all other; and therefore the Philosophers have called
him Microcosmus, a little World, which does respond unto the greater: for as
the motion of the whole glove is caused by the voluntary motion of an
intellectual substance (which some call Daemones, or Intelligentiae) so man is
moved by his intellectiue soul, because as Aristotle has proved: Every thing
that is moved, is moved by the virtue of another. And as this most wonderful
frame or Machina does contain all things in it self, because Extra coelum
nihil est: so man by knowledge is all, and at all nothing natural is hid from
him, being not without motions and affectations equal to that glorious and
heavenly Hierarchy. And to end this respondency betwixt Microcosmus and
Cosmus, betwixt Man and the World, in man are two motions, intellectual and
sensual, the one to good, the other to bad, so in the world are two local
motions, rational and irrational, the one into the West, the other into ye
East: for as the irrational motion is contrary to the rational; so is the
intellectual to the sensual. Man thus resembling the heavens, became a
Christian, taking the denomination thereof from Christ; Jesus being the proper
name, and Christ the surname; Jesus being the name of his Godhead and
divinity, and Christ the name of his office and dignity: Jesus in Greek being
called Sother, in Latin Saluator; in English both signifying a Savior; and in
conclusion, note from S. Bernard 4 creations of man: The first without man and
woman, as Adam out of the earth: The second of man without woman, as Euah, of
Adams rib: the third of man and woman, as we are: and the 4 of a virgin,
without man, as Christ of Mary.

CHAP. II. The definition of the World.
THe world is Heaven and Earth, and all things therein contained as well simple
as mixed, and (as Moses testifies) was made by God. The Latins call it Mundus a
mouendo, because it is in continual motion; it is called of the Greeks
Cosmus, a pulchritudo, because it is most fair and beautiful, as well by
reason of the Elements, and such transparent bodies, as by reason of the
resplendency of the Sun, Moon, and Stars: for indeed what is more
admirable to behold: which caused Plato to say, eyes were given to man to view
the glory of heaven, as may also appear by Ovid.

Os hominum sublime dedit, coelumque videre. For what is a more sure testimony
of the wonderful works of God, or what greater delight is there (to them that
truly understand it) then the beholding of the glory of the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, in observing their motions upon their Excentrickes, and Concentricks,
in noting the diversity of aspect and radiations, with their retrogradations
and directions, their magnitudes and distances, and such like. As for the name
of heaven, it is called with the Latins Coelum, quia coelatum est, pictatum
and ornatum.

CHAP. III. Of the division of the World.
THe world is divided into two parts or regions, Elementary and Aethereall: The
Elementary part is subject unto daily alteration, and does contain the Fire,
Air, Water, and Earth. The Aethereall region does contain in his concauity,
the Elementary region, and this Aethereall region is called of some, Quinta
essentia, the quint-essence, or fist substance, which is a body of it self,
differing from all Elements, and things Elementall, as well in matter as in
form, and no less in nature and quality, containing no contrariety, and being
without corruption; such is heaven, and the matter thereof, but the Elements
are far of otherwise, not simple, but compounded of viscotions matter: for a
pure Element cannot be seen, because that which is pure wants color, and
that which wants color is not visible, and therefore the Elements
intermingle themselves according to their propinquity, so that an Element is
that whereof any thing is compounded: they are the first of compositions, yet
of themselves not compounded: for they be imagined simple bodies in respect of
other bodies, compound and mixed of these Elements; every part takes name of
the whole, as every part of water, is water; and every part of fire, is fire:
They be diuisible into parts of diverse forms, and of the commixion of them is
made and engendered diverse things of sundry kinds, as well things vegitatiue, as
sensitive, rational or irrational, and every of these Elements has and
nourishes therein living creatures, as the Salamander in our fire, which is
but an imperfect element, because it is mixed with viscotious and earthy matter:
the Camelion in the air, which there also lives, and Birds which there abide:
the fish in the water, Moles and worms in the earth, and man and beast upon
the earth: and you must know, that every body compounded of the four Elements,
is elementary, not that they be Elements formerly, but vertually in mixed bodies.

CHAP. IIII. Of the Elementall part of the World.
IN the Elementall part of the world is contained the earth, the water, air,
and fire, the superficial conuexity of every one of these resting in the
superficial concauity of the next superior Element; and therefore the earth
hangs in the concauity of the water; the water, in the concauity of the air,
and the air in the concauity of the fire:even as you see the scales of onions
one enclosed in another. Now for the earth, it is a round body like unto a
ball, dark and solid without any concauity, hanging by the providence of God,
fixed in the midst of the world, insomuch that if you were in any other part
of the earth, you should be no nearer unto ye heavens then you are in England;
which moved ye Philosophers to say: Stellae aequae distare a centro terrae,
sieve in Orient, sieve in Occidente, etc. And the Earth (as you shall perceive
hereafter) is but a point in respect of the Heavens, and is by nature cold and
dry. Next above the earth is the water, the earth hanging in the concauity
thereof, they both indeed making but one round globe, as may appear by the
eclypse of the Moon, the seas being bounded and limited by the earth, as may
appear by Psalm. 107, and Job. 38. the water is of nature cold and moist, in
compassing the superficial conuexity whereof is the air, and is divided into
three regions, the inferior, superior, and mean; the inferior is warm by
reason of the reflection of the Sun beams reuerberated and beateu back by
the earth: the superior is hot by occasion of the proximity of the fire, and
there Comets and fiery Meteors are engendered; the mean is coldest, as well by
the remoteness of the fiery region, as also for that the reflection and
reuerberation of the sun beams cannot extend so far, and here all watery
meteors are created, as snow and such like: but the Element of air of it self
is warm and moist, hanging in the concauity of the fire, which is hot and
dry, so that each Element has qualities of the other by participation as the
air does participate with the fire in warmness, with the water in moistness,
the earth with the water in coldness, and with the fire in dryness, so that
two elements be extremely contrary, as the fire, warm and dry, is contrary to
the water, cold and moist; and the air warm and most is contrary to the earth
cold and dry, so that there is in every Element but one predominating quality,
called the quality passive, because they be contrary amongst themselves and
cannot consist in every Element, as the fire exceeds in heat, the air in
moistness, coldness in the water, and dryness in the earth; and what other
qualities they have, comes by participation: of the material virtue, and
natural commixtion of which Element, all bodies perfect and imperfect (which
are bodies mixed) are engendered: For you must know, that there is nothing in the
world, but is compounded hereof as stones take most of the nature of the earth,
metals of the slimy nature of the water, plants, herbs, and all living things
take most of the air, and yet all these have part of the fire, and therefore
some stones, as lime-stones and thunderbolts, take most of the fire, other
stones more of the water then earth, as Crystal, Birrell, and Pearls, and
other participate more of the air then earth, as such that will not sink, and
so amongst metals, some participate more of one element then of another: as
lead and silver of the earth; quicke-siluer of ye water; copper of the air;
and iron and gold of ye fire: so may it be said of herbs and plants, the roots
by their thickness participating most of the earth; the leaves by their
moistness, of water; the blossoms for their lightness, of the air; and the
seed by reason of the generatiue spirit, of the fire: so do all beasts
participate more of one Element then another, as is said before: albeit some
parts of them participate of the other Elements, as bones of the earth, flesh
of the air, the spirit vital of the fire, and the humor of the water.
Likewise the senses of man be attributed unto the four Elements, as the
understanding to the fire, the reason to the air, the imagination to the
water, and feeling to the earth. The like is of the outward senses, the sight
is appropriated to the fire, for light is not without fire; the hearing to the
air, as caused by the reuerberation thereof; the smell to the water: for no
smell is without moisture; and the touching to the earth. So be the acts of the
body, and passions of the mind attributed to the elements; as moving slowly, to
the earth: fear and sorrow, to the water: joy, grace and maintenance, to the
air: anger, fury and unrest, to the fire, Let this suffice, lest I be tedious.

CHAP. V. Of the Aethereall or Celestial part of the World.
THe celestial part of the world, called of some the Ethereal Region, or
Quinta essentia, encompasseth and contains in the concauity thereof, all the
Elementall Region. And this celestial part has in it ye seven Planets, and
their spheres, the starry Firmament, the Christalline Heaven, the First Mouer,
and the Imperial Heaven, as shall follow.

Of the first Heaven.

The Philosophers had no knowledge of this Imperial Heaven: only the
Scriptures teach us to believe the saine; and is called the Imperial Heaven,
by reason of the clearenesse and resplendency: It is immovable, made by God,
the first day he began his creation of the world, and by him immediately
replenished with his ministers, the holy Angels: It is the foundation of ye
world. most fine and pure in substance, most round in shape, most great in
quantity, most clear in quality, and most high in place, where (as it is
thought) remains the humanity of Jesus Christ, and has therein three
Hierarchias, holy orders, or principalities, called: Epiphonia, Epiphonomia,
and Euphumia; and these are called of some, Supercoelestiall, Celestial, and
Subcoelestiall. Now the first has in it three orders, as Seraphins, Cherubins,
and Thrones: The first excelling in zealous love, the second in knowledge, and
the third in justice. Epiphonomia has likewise three orders, as
Principalities, teaching inferiors duty to their superiors: Powers, chasing
away evil spirits, comforting such as fight in ghostly battle; and
Dominations, teaching men how to behave themselves in spiritual conflicts.
Lastly, Euphumia or Subcoelestiall has also under it three lower orders, as
Virtues for comforters, Archangels, showing miracles, and Angels working
miracles: to conclude, here is the abundance of all goodness, and perfect
felicity with the privation of evil.

CHAP. VI. Of the first Moveable.
Under the Imperial Heaven, is situate the First Moveable, called Primum
Mobile, containing all other inferior Spheres, and by his natural motion
moves from East to West, and to the East again in four and twenty hours,
and by violence of this motion carries with him all the inferior Spheres,
contrary to their proper motion, which is to the East; and many Philosophers
think, that if this motion were not flackened by the contrary course of the
inferior Spheres, that the frame of Heaven and Earth would be torn in
pieces, and nothing prosper or remain, by reason of the violence thereof: This
Heaven is puce and clear without stars.

CHAP. VII. Of the Christalline Heaven.
THe Christalline Heaven is also a clear substance, void of Stars, not
subject to the sight, perlucid, transparent, and most slow in motion, moving
(according to the succession of the signs) one degree in 100 years, and
accomplishing a full revolution in 36000 years, but according to Alfonsus, in
49000 years. The reason why this heaven does require so long a time, is
because of the neernesse thereof to the first Moveable, which turns this
heaven and the rest about with him by a contrary motion, as is said, and
therefore the nearer any Sphere is to the first Mouer, the longer is he in
accomplishing his revolution: This revolution of some is called Mag^nus annus
Platonis, because when it was complete he thought all things should return to
the estate they were at first. This Heaven is called of some the watery Heaven,
by the authority of Scriptures, Genesis chap. 1. and in the Psalms: All the
waters above the firmament, etc.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Starry Heaven.
THis Firmament is a most glorious heaven adorned and beautified with all the
fixed stars, whose natural motion is upon two little circles, the one about
the head of Aries, the other of Libra, whose diameters is 4 degrees. 18 min. and 43
sec. and is called the motion of Trepidation; but indeed ye motion of this
heaven is threefold: for first it turns about from East to West in four and
twenty hours, according to the diurnall motion: Next it moves from West to
East according to the 9 Heaven, and is called the motion of the Auges of the
fixed stars; which Auges are points limiting the greatest distance of any
Sphere from the center of the world. The last is made by virtue of his own
proper motion, as sometimes toward the South, and other times into the North,
which is called Motus trepidationis, as is said: this Sphere makes his whole
revolution in 7000 years, and this motion somes time is called Motus,
accessus, and recessus, only proper to the 8 Sphere, and in this sphere or
heaven is the Zodiac, and all the rest of the circles in the material
sphere imagined to be: And this 8 sphere, according to Albateginus is
distant from the earth 19000 semidiameters.

CHAP. IX. The course, color, placing, magnitude, and distance of the seven
Planets, with the thickness of their Spheres.
Under and within the concauity of the starry Heaven is placed the Orb and
Sphere of Saturn, and so the rest successively, which are known by their
color and magnitude: and if any one require to know why these spheres (being
so many) are not subject to sight, but seem as one entire body: the reason is,
for that they be Bodies perspicuous, clear and transparent. But to proceed.

Saturn moving under the 8 sphere, is of a pale leaden color, requiring 30
years to pass through the Zodiac, and is bigger then the earth 95 times,
Albateginus says but 79. Alfraganus says 91. their diameters being as 9 to 2;
and is distant from the earth 15800 semidiameters, but as Tycho Brache says,
10550 semidiameters, and as the vulgar say, 237978 miles and a half, Saturn
being from the firmament 120485 miles, so that the heaven of Saturn must
contain in thickness 196044546/11 miles, otherwise it could not contain his
star.

Jupiter is next under Saturn, fair and bright, ending his revolution in 12.
years: according to Albateginus he appears as the 12. part of the Sun, and
therefore is bigger then the earth 81 times, Alfrag. says 95. others 91. their
diameters being as 32. to 7. he is distant from the earth 10423. semidiameters,
but wc the vulgar 159357 miles, whose heaven contains in thickenesse
18996546/11 miles, and is below Saturn 78721. miles.

Mars, within the concauity of the sphere of Jupiter, appears of a fiery
color, running his course in 2. years, appearing as the 20, part of the
Sun, and therefore does contain the whole magnitude of the earth once, and
as Albateg. says, a third part more: some say once and ten sixteenes, others
would have it twice, which is false: so that their diameters are as 7. to 6.
Alfraganus puts Mars and the earth in a Sesquialter proportion, with an 8. part
over, which is once and a half, and one 8. part. Mars is distant from the
earth 4584. fere semidiameters: but as the vulgar have said 80536 miles, and
his sphere is in thickness 26308800. miles, and is under Jupiter 78721. miles.

The Sun is placed in ye middle of the planets, most clear and bright, the
wellspring of pure light oculus mundi, anima and cor coeli, finishing his
revolution every year, delighting (as a Giant) to run his course. And
according to Ptolomeus Albateginus, and Alfraganus, he is 166 times bigger then
the earth, so that their diameters beaye proportion, as 11 to 2. But Copernicus
will have the Sun to be but 162 fere more then the earth: so that their
diameters areas 5 P. 27. M. to one. According to the first account, the Sun
is distant hence, 1150 Semidiameters; but with the later, 1142 semidiameters;
and as the vulgar say, it is from the earth to Sol 64811 miles, his Heaven
containing in thickness, 343996 4/11 miles: he being below Mars, 15725 miles.

Venus, under the sphere of the Sun, does appear very clear and shining;
not three years past, being the Evening star, she was taken of many at first
for a Comet: for indeed she is brighter then Jupiter; ending her revolution as
the Sun, from whom she cannot depart more then 48 degrees: so that going
before the sun, she is called the Morning Star, and following the sun,
the Evening Star: she appears as the 10 part of Sols diameter, and
therefore is lesser then the earth 36 times, their diameters being as 10 to 3.
Alfraganus would have the earth 28 times more then Venus, others 39, others 37.
Tycho says, 6 times: she is from the earth 618 semidiameters, and as the
vulgar say, 41374 miles, lying below the Sun, 23437 miles, her Heaven being
in thickness, 32744946/11 miles.

Mercury, wandering under the sphere of Venus, appears somewhat shining, but
not very bright, being never more then 29 degrees elongated frrom the Sun,
and therefore seldom seen; his diameter shows as the 15 part of the Suns
diameter, whereby we may gather, that he is less then the earth 19000 times:
Alfraganus would have him 22000 at least: others 32000, others 3143 times
less. But Tycho will have it but 19 times, and his diameter to be to the
diameter of the earth, as 3 to 8. With the vulgar he is distant from the earth
28562 miles, and is below Venus 1282 miles: his Heaven containing in
thickness, 253372 miles.

The lowest of all the Planets is the Moon, whose body is encompassed within
the sphere of of Mercury, running over the whole Zodiacque in 27 days, 7
hours, 43 minutes, and near 6 seconds; she is lesser then the earth 39. times
so that the body of the Sun contains the body of the Moon, 6540 fere.
Herewith agrees Prolemaeus, Albategnius, and Alfraganus: But Copernicus will
have the Moon 4.3 times less: so that (where with the former) their diameters
be as 17 to 5, with Copernicus it is as 7 to 2, and therefore the body of the
sun must exceed the body of the Moon 7000; of the vulgar she is said 15750
miles distant from the earth, with Tycho 60 semidiameters, whose heaven
contains 105222 2/33 miles, and is below Mercury 12812 miles.

As touching these distances of the planets, you must know that it is meant
when they be in their mean motion, neither in their Apogaeon, or Perigaeon:
for then they be much further off, or far nearer unto us.

CHAP. X Of the magnitude of the Sun and Moon, and the rest of the Planets,
with their diameters, and distances from the Earth, in miles, according to
Tycho Brahe: and of the magnitude of the fixed Stars, and other secrets
concerning them.
TYcho Brahe, a Dane (as by his works, and commendations of our sovereign
Lord king James may appear) a diligent obseruer of the celestial bodies, does
much differ in their diameters, the magnitude of their bodies, and their
distance from the earth, from all other ancient writers, as it shall appear by
his demonstration of the suns magnitude.

He first observed by a hollow instrument of 32 foot long, that the greatest
apparent diameter of the sun, being in his Apogaeon, was 30 minutes, in his
Perigaeon 32 minutes, and in his mean motion about the Equinoctial, or a
little after, 31 minutes, rejecting utterly the opinion of Ptolemaeus and
Copernicus, that affirm the apparent diameter of the sun in his Apogaeon, to
be 31 minutes, 40 seconds, in Perigaeon near 34, and in his mean motion 32
minutes: Likewise for the distance of the sun from the earth in his mean
motion, he reiects Ptolemaeus 1165 semidiameters, as too much, and Copernicus
1142 as too little, and iumps at the mean betwixt both, and so pronou^ceth ye
sun in his mean motion 1150 semidiameters from ye earth, drawing thereby more
near to a Germane, one Io. Franc. Offus. ye would have the sun 576 whole
diameters from the earth, which is 1152 semidiameters, having thus presupposed
his appare^t diameter in his mean motion 31 minutes, and accordingly his
distance from the earth 1150 semidiameters: thus he demonstrates his
Corpulencie.

DEC is the body of ye Sun, whose diameter DC makes the angle DAC 31 M, at A
the earth. Now ye distance of the sun from the earth, is AB 1150
semidiameters: therefore in ye right lined triangle astronomical diagram of sun
and earth there is given two known sides containing a known angle: (for D A
and C A differ not sensibly from A B) so that the third side is P. 1122 fere,
and so many semidiameters of the earth does the diameter of the sun contain:
therefore his diameter is greater then the earths 5 1/7 4/5 times, by which
according to Cubicall numbers, ye body of the Sun does exceed the body of the
Earth but 139. times, and no more will Tycho allow.

Now the Apparent diameter of the Moon in her mean motion, is 33. minutes, her
distance 60 semidiameters: the diameter of the earth containing her diameter 3
2/4 2/9 times, so yt their proportions are as 2 to 7. And thus briefly of these
two Planets, whereby it may appear, that according to Tycho the diameter of
the Sun contains the Moons diameter 18 times, whereby the body of the Moon
is less then the Sun, above 5848 times: so that the Sun, neither according
to Prolemaeus, does exceed the Moon more then 6000, nor yet according to
Copernicus 7000 times: and in conclusion, ye Sun in his mean motion is distant
from the earth 1150 semidiameters (as is said) in his Apogaeon in June, 1190.
and in his Perigaeon but 1110 times, as in December.

Now for the rest of the Planets according to Tycho take them thus briefly,
lest I be tedious.

Saturn in his mean motion is from the earth semid. 10550. his apparent
diameter is M. 1. S. 5. containing the earths diameter 2 9/^ ^/^ times, bearing
proportion as 31 to 11, exceeding the earth 22 times:

Jupiter is from ye earth 3990. semidiameters, his apparent diameter is M. 2,
and in proportion to the earths diameter, as 12 to 5, exceeding the earth but
14 times.

Mars is distant from the earth 1745 semidiameters, his apparent diameter not
all M. 2 wanting about one third part, therefore says Tycho: Per cubicam
numerationem terra aliquanto plus qua^ tredecies Mart mayor, that is less
then the earth 13 times.

The apparent diameter of Venus is 3 M. her diameter being to the diameter of
the earth, as 6 to 11: so that the body of Venus is less then the earth 6
times, and, and distant as the Sun.

Mercury his apparent diameter is 2 M. which the ancient counted insensible,
but Tycho says, he being removed something from the Sun appears as a Scarre
of the first magnitude: his diameter being to the earths diameter, as 6 to 11,
the corpulency of the earth exceeding him but 6 times and is distant as the
Sun.

By that which is said we may conclude for the common capacity, that the
Planets be distant in miles according to T. Brahe from the center of the earth,
as follows.

The exact distance of the seven Planets from the earth, as they be in their
mean motion, according to modern observation.
Saturn is from the earth 9073000 miles. Jupiter, 3431400 miles. Mars 1500700
miles. The Sun 989000 miles. Venus and Mercury in their mean motion be as
the Sun, to which Copernicus also assenteth. The Moon. 48760 miles.

Of the fixed Stars.
The number of the fixed Stars, that the Astronomers take notice of, is 1025.
But the Portugals have brought home news (by their voyages to India) of
certain other constellations and Clouds near to the South pole; but those
discoueries as yet be not held probable, chiefly for that Ptolemaeus, in
respect of the place where he dwelt, with a little more travel, might have
found them out, but did not. The stars in number be not infinite, as
some'thinke, as may appear, Psalm. 147. He counts the number of the Stars,
etc. And in Nahum, Chap. 3. ver. 16. Thou have multiplied thy Merchants above
the stars of heaven.

Why the Stars seem fewest in Summer, and most in Winter.
The reason is, because the predominating cold of the Winter is driven in
Summer into the midst region of the air; where (by reason of the
Antiperistasis, or circumstance of heat above and beneath) the air is so
ingrosed and thickened that our sight cannot pierce through the same, whereby
the lesser stars appear not to ye sight, whereas in winter the cold breaking
forth, and dispersing it self, becomes more thin, and the air more pure,
whereby we may see unto the stars, as through a transparent glass, or the
light of the Sun, which obscureth the brightness of the Stars, never
departs far from us in Summer, leaving a mixture of his light above the
Horizon, whereas in winter he is much depressed, for the darker the night, the
brighter the stars, and the more appear, so the air be clear. And this is
another cause.

Of the magnitude of the Stars compared to the Earth.
Amongst the number of the fixed stars, there be six magnitudes, and the
least is bigger then the earth, as follows.

Stars of the first magnitude are to the globe of the earth, as 6859 to 64,
their diameters being as 19 to 4, and therefore contain the globe of the
earth 107 times, and thereof, as the Heart of the Lion, Orion, the Goat, etc.

Stars of the second magnitude, be to the globe of the earth, as 19465109 to
216000, their diameters being as 269 to 60, and therefore exceeds the earth
90 times, as the right side of Perseus, the right thigh of Pegasus, etc.

Stars of the third magnitude be to the globe of the earth, as 15625 is unto
216, their diameters being as 25 to 6, exceeding the earth 72 ^/^ times, as the
Girdle of Andromeda, etc.

Stars of the fourth magnitude, be to the globe of the earth, as 6859 is to
125. their diamemeters being as 19 to 5, containing the earth 54 times, as the
North Asellus, the former and later of the Kids, etc.

Stars of the fifth magnitude be to the globe of the earth as 1685159 is to
46656. their diameters being as 119 to 36, containing the earth 36 times, as
the third of the fourth in the left wing of Virgo, the right knee of Leo, etc.

Stars of the sixth magnitude be to the globe of the earth, as 9261 is unto
512, their diameters being as 31 to 8, and therefore contain the globe of the
earth 18 ^^/19 times.

Of Constellations.
A Constellation, called otherwise an Asterisme, is a represe^ting of a lining
creature, or some other thing (after a certain sort) as well for that the
number of stars in that place represent ye form of such a creature, or such
a figure, as also for that these figures express some property of ye stars
that are in them.

Of these Constellations, the number that be in all the heavens, be 48,
whereof 21 be in the North, in the South 15, and in the Zodiac of the eighth
sphere be 12, as Aries, Taurus, etc. But besides these constellations, there
be some other more lately devised, as Antinous and Berenices hair. Also the
constellations recounted by the Portugals, as the Cross, the Dove, the
Triangle, and the little Clouds about the South pole.

Of the twinkling of Stars.
The stars do not twinckle, as we think they do, only our eyes be deceived
by the motion of the air: for as the air has one motion proper, that is
upwards, so has it another motion improper, caused by the revolution of the
heavens every 24 hours, which draw all the aerie region about therewith, by
which means, the apparent form of the stars is distracted, seeming to cast
forth sparkles, called twinkling, which we may well prove by a piece of
silver in the bottom of a swift running river, or by looking upon the stars,
which by reflection be seen in the same.

But the Planets do not twinckle, because they be far more near unto us,
whereby their beams be stronger, and less distorted, piercing strongly
through the air, so that they shine clear without any twinkling: for the
nearer any light is unto us, the stronger is the beam of the light that
proceeds from the same.

What the stars be made of.
The Stars be of the same matter as the Heaven is, wherein they be fixed, they
be defined, Densior pars sui orbis, so that they be of the same matter, though
far more thick, apt to receive and retain the light of the Sun, whereby
they become subject to the sight: for let the light of a candle pierce through
any hole upon the roof of some dark house, and the light of the same will
appear, and make that part shining and subject to sight, whereas the contrary
would happen in a light and perspicuous place: for the heaven it self is most
pure and thin, and not visible, and therefore some think the milke-white
circle in heaven called of Astronomers, Galaxia, is more visible then the rest
of the heaven, Arist. says, but untruly, that it is a Meteor; Others say, it
is made by reason of the number of stars in that place, which confusedly
mingle their light together, as Democritus: therefore understand a star to be
of the same matter as his heaven is, being only the thickest part of his orb,
which reflecting, not transmitting the beams of the Sun, cause him to be more
shining and subject to sight.

CHAP. XI. Of the 6 great Circles in Heaven, and the twelve Signs.
MAN, with the pencell of imagination, has traced out in the 8 sphere, 6
great circles, and also 4 lesser: the great circles are, first the Horizon,
which some call the Finitor, and is a great circle dividing the visible part of
the heaven from the invisible: that is, the upper hemispheare from the lower.

2 The Meridian is a circle passing by the poles of the world, and the
Vertical point, to which circle when the Sun comes, above the earth it is
noone, and under the earth, night,

3 The Equinoctial is a great circle dividing the sphere into two parts, and
when the Sun is therein (which happens twice every year) the days and
nights are equal through the world, unless with such that inhabit just under
the Poles.

4 The Zodiaque is a great oblique circle, 12 degrees broad, dividing the
sphere into two equal parts, and crossing the Equinoctial in Aries and Libra,
so that the part upon the North side the Equinoctial is called the North part,
and ye other between the Equinoctial and the South pole, ye South moity of
the Zodiaque: In the midst of this broad circle is a line called the
Eclipticke, or via Solis, for that the Sun and Moon be never eclipsed, but
in that circle: so that there be 6 degrees upon the North side the line, and
other 6 upon the South side the Eclipticke, which is called North and South
Declination, further then which ye Sun departs not North or South, being
bounded with the Tropiques. This circle is called Zodiacus a (...), which is
vita, because according to the motion of the Planets under the same, life is
given unto all inferior creatures, or it is called (...) Zodion, which is
Animal, because it is divided into 12 equal parts, every part being called a
sign, and have the name of some one living creature or other, agreeing to the
nature of those parts, or by reason of the disposition of the fixed stars,
agreeing to the nature of those beasts: with the Latins it is called Signifer,
quia sert signa, or because it is divided into them. Arist. in Lib. 2. de
Generatione and Corruptione, calls it Circulus obliquus, where he says,
that according to the access and recesse of the Sun in this oblique circle,
all generation and corruption is made in these inferiors: the which signs with
their characters follow.

1 Aries. 2 Taurus. 3 Gemini II. 4 Cancer. 5 Leo. 6 Virgo. 7 Libra. 8 Scorpio 9
Sagitarius. 10 Capricornus. 11 Aquarius. 12 Pisces.
Of which 12 signs the first 6 be called Northern, the other Southern, the
Astronomers do also divide some into Ascendents, as from Capricorn to the end
of Gemini, Others into Descendents; as from the beginning of Cancer, to the end
of Sagitarius: some again be Vernal, as Aries, Taurus, and Gemini: some
Estiuall, as Cancer, Leo, Virgo: some Autumnall, as Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius:
and some Hiemall, or Brumall, as Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces, which
signify the 4 quarters of the year: the first compared to sanguine, and
attributed to childhood; the second choler, attributed to youth; the third
melancholy, attributed to elder age; and the last phlegm, attributed unto old
age. Also some are of the fiery Triplicity, as Aries, Leo, Sagitarius; some of
the earthly Triplicity, as Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn; some of ye aerie
triplicity, as Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; and some of the watery Triplicity, as
Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Some again are moveable, others fixed, others
common: Some likewise be Oriental, some Meridionall, some Occidentall, and
some Septentrionall, some diurnall, some Nocturnall, some Masculine, and others
seminine, as shall appear in their proper natures.

5 and 6. The Colures are two great circles moveable and passing by ye poles of
the world, whose office is to distinguish the Solstitials and Equinoctials,
they be called Colures a (...) with the Greeks, which is Membrum, and (...),
which is Bos syluester, because the tail of a wild beast being erected (which
is a member) does make a semicircle yet imperfect: or as Schola interprets it,
A (...) with the Greeks, or (...), the first, syllable being short, a (...),
which is Mutilum, mancum, imperfect, or maimed, and (...), which is Cauda the
tail, because they appear imperfect, or maimed, being never seen all at once
to us, but as it were the tail or some part cut off: these two circles, the
one pass by the beginning of Cancer and Capricorn, appointing the Summer and
Winter Solstitials: the other by the beginning of Aries and Libra, coequating
ye days and nights, and cross one the other with tight sphericall angles upon
the poles of the world, and these 4 times are expressed in these 2 verses.

Hac duo Solstitium faciunt: Cancer, Capricornus:
Sed noctes aequant Aries, and Libra diebus.
CHAP. XII. Of the four lesser Circles in Heaven.
THese circles be called lesser circles, because they divide not the sphere
into two equal parts, as the great circles do, and they be four in number,
called the two Polar circles, and the two Tropickes, of which Polar circles,
the one is called ye Arctique, the other the Antarctique, both being made by
the conversion of the Poles of the Ecliptique, so that they be always distant
as far from the poles of the world, as the Suns greatest declination from the
Equinoctial comes to, which is 23 degrees 28 minutes: the Arctique takes
his name of Arctos, which is the Bear, whose one fore-foote does also describe
this circle. This circle is also called Septentrional, of Septentrio, which
signifies 7 Oxen, represented by the 7 stars in the lesser Bear. The
Tropickes take their names from the Greeks also, a (...), which is conuersio,
or (...), which with Cicero lib. 2. de natura Deor. is Reuersio, so that taking
the Tropique from Tropos, it is a conversion or reuersion of the Sun, because
being in either of these circles, he always turns again toward the
Equinoctial.

CHAP. XIII. Of Time.
TIme is the measurer of motion, and (as Armandus says) of Rest and
Quietness, containing three parts; Past, Present, and to Come: Time present,
called (Nunc) being a moment indivisible, or the least part of Time, and yet
the beginner and ender of time: even as a point is the least part of a line,
and yet begins and ends the same; for Nunc (now, this instant) does knit
Tempus praeteritum, and futurum, ending time past, and beginning time to come.
There is also a space or time, called Seculum. An age in English, being an
hundred years: at the end of which time, in Rome they were used to celebrate
Plays, called Ludi seculares. There is another space of time, containing a
thousand years, called Aeuum, being ten Ages; But Johannes de sacro Bosco,
diuides the lesser parts of time into five parts, as Quadrans, the fourth part
of the day, or six hours, an hour being the 24 part of a natural day; 2
Punctus in the Suns account the 4 part of an hour, in the Moons the 5 part;
3 Momentum, the 10 part of Punctus; 4 Vncia the 12 part of Momentum, and the
last is Atomos, the 44 part of Vncia.

CHAP. XIIII. Of the day both Natural and Artificial, and their diverse
beginnings.
THe day is of two sorts, Natural and Artificial, the Natural day is the
space of 24 hours, in which time the Sun is carried by the first Mouer, from
the East into the West, and so round about the world into the East again.

The Artificial day continues from Sun rising to Sun setting, and the
Artificial night is from the suns setting to his rising. And you must note
that this natural day, according to diverse, has diverse beginnings, as the
Romans count it from midnight to midnight, because at that time our Lord was
borne, being Sunday, and so do we account it for fasting days. The Arabians
begin their day at Noone, and end at Noone ye next day: for because they say
the Sun was made in the Meridian, and so do all Astronomers account the day,
because it always falls at one certain time. The Vmbrians, the Tuscan^, the
Jews, the Athenians, Italians, and Egyptians, do begin their day at sun set,
and so do we celebrate festival days. The Babylonians, Persians, and
Bohemians, begin their day at sun rising, holding till sun setting, and so
do our Lawyers count it in England.

The Physicians divide the day into 4 quarters, the first is from the 9 hour
of the night to the 3 hour of the day, warm and moist, moving to sanguine.
The second is from the 3 hour of the Artificial day, to the 9 hour, warm
and dry, increasing choler. The third is from the 9 hour to the 3. hour of
the night, cold and dry, begetting melancholy. The fourth is from the 3 hour
of the night, to the 9 again, cold and moist, causing phlegm.

Ioannes de sacro Bosco diuides the Artificial day thus into 4 quarters,
calling the first Rubens, the second Splendens, the third vrens, and the fourth
Tepens, whereupon the sun is fained to have 4 horses, Eous, Lampas, Pyrois,
and Phlegon.

The Jews began at sun rising, and so divided the Artificial day into 4
quarters, alotting to every quarter 3 hours, whereby also they divided the day
Artificial into 12 equal parts, calling every part an hour, and beginning at
sun rising: so that 12 a clock, or high noone, was their 6 hour, and sun
set their 12 hour: so that where the Scriptures say: The Ague left him the
seventh hour, that is, at one a clock; so the laborers ye came into the
Vineyard at the 11 hour, came at five of the clock: but by this 5 a clock is
meant the hour of the Artificial day, and not the Natural day, the which is
known according to the time of the year: for the Artificial day is done some
time of the year before 5, as in the 25 Chapter.

CHAP. XV. Of the names of the Days, and their Etymology.
THe Jews call their first day Sabbatum, the next, Prima Sabbati, the next,
secunda Sabbati, etc. according as is written: Mane prima Sabbati surgens Dei
filius: that is, the first day after the Sabbath, which is our Sunday, upon
which day the Romans (calling the Planets Gods) began their account, calling
ye first the day of the Sun, the next of ye Moon, the next of Mars, the next
of Mercury, the fifth of Jupiter, the sixth of Venus, and the last of Saturn,
still skipping to the third Planet, because the 24 hours in the Artificial
day and night, are given to the 7 Planets successively: so that if Sol rule the
first hour upon Sunday, (as he must, because it is his own day) then Venus
has the next, and so proceed, giving every of the 24 hours a Planet in true
succession, and you shall find, that the 24 hour, which begins Monday,
falls to ye Moon; therefore if any day be denominated by any one planet, the
next day following takes denomination of the third Planet next following,
which order after the Christians observed. And you shall note, that a day in
Latin, called Dies, is so called, a (...), which is Clarus, or a (...), which
is Duo, because ye natural day is divided into 2 parts, to wit, into Day, and
Night: or it may be called Dies, a Dijs: for the Planets be called Dij, (Gods)
whereof the days take their names.

Nox, the Night, is so called, a Noceo, noces, because it is Tempus nocentibus
aptum, a fit time to do hurt and mischief.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Week.
A Week has diverse names, in Latin it is called Septimana, a Septem and
Mane, as it were, having septem Matutina tempora, seven mornings: And so pars
is taken pro toto. It is also called Hebdomada, ab (...), which is septem, as
containing seven days. It is also called Sabbatum by the Jews, and therefore
it is said in Scripture, Ieiuno bis in Sabbato, etc. whereby Sabbatum is
Aequiuocum ad totam septimanam. And you must note, that the Jews Sabbath day
was Saturday, but the Christians observed Sunday for to begin their week,
because on that day our Lord was borne, rose, and sent his holy Ghost upon his
Apostles.

CHAP. XVII. Of a Month, Solar, and Usual.
OF Months there be three kinds, Solar, Lunar, and Usual. The Solar month is
the space of time that the Sun runs through one sign of the Zodiac, being
30 days.

The Usual Month is the number of days according as they be in our
Calendar, and amongst the Latins, Romulus first distinguished the months,
dividing ye year into 10 months, because in that time a woman might bring
forth a child, or because (during that time) it was not fit for a woman to
marry after the death of her husband.

The first month he called Martius, a Mart, of Mars his Father, or rather of
Mars in respect of war, because as then the Roman Kings were used to proceed
in expeditions: for it is rather thought that Amulius was Romulus his Father.
then Mars, Amulius being his uncle.

The next month he called April, ab Aperiendo, because then the poares of the
earth opened. The third is May, a Maioribus: the fourth Iunius, a Iunioribus.
The rest of the months were called Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October,
November, and December, because they were 5 6, etc months distant from March.
But after, Numa Pompilius added, two more months, to make them twelve, calling
the one January, a Ianua, because as you pass per Ianuam in atrium: so per
Ianuarium in annum: or of Ianus, the God of Merchandise, who having two faces,
so January has two respects, the one to the year past, the other to the year
to come. The other month he called February, a Februo: that is, a Plutone,
because then the Romans offered sacrifice to Pluto, and the infernal Gods, for
the souls of their ancestors: or it is called February, a Febre, because as
then in warm regions, men were accustomed, Febricitare, that is, to be sick
of an Ague: so also may September be said, quasi septimus ab imbre, which is a
Tempore pluuioso. And to these months he gave some 30 days, others 31 days
orderly: so that when he came to January he wanted a day, which he took from
February, which he restored again in the Leape-yeare. Then comes Julius
Caesar, and alters the month Quintilis to July, calling it after his name:
for that he was borne in that month. After whom comes Augustus, and calls
the month Sextilis Augustus, after his own name; and grudging that his month
August should have lesser days in it then Caesar's month, he takes another
day from February, adding the same to August, and thereby left February but 28
days, whereby he did disorder the days of the month, that before did
consist of 30 and 31 days successively, making July, August, and September
have 31 days altogether, and February but 28 days: wherefore to avoid this
inconvenience, he was forced to take a day from September, giving it to
October, and another from November for December. The which ordination of ye
months, and position of days, is used to this present time, according to
these verses:

Sep. No. Iun. Ap. dato triginta: reliquis magic vno:
Nisit bissextus, februus minor esto duobus.
Which is,

Thirty days has September,
April, June, and November:
The rest have thirty and one,
Save February alone.
Which month has but eight and twenty meare,
Save when it is Bissextile, or Leape-yeare.
CHAP. XVIII. Of the Lunar Month, and the diversities thereof.
OF Months Joan. de sacro Bosco notes 4 kinds, as the month of Peragration,
of Apparition, Medicinal, and the month of Consecution.

The month of Peragration is a space of time containing days 27, hours 7,
minutes 43, seconds 7, thirds 15, fourths 36, fifths 55. In which space the
Moon runs through the 12 signs of the Zodiac, and is called of some a
year, of which years it is not much for one to live 1000: for 80 Solar years
make as many within 40. But this month is accomplished certain minutes sooner
or later, according to her swift or slow motion.

The second is the Month of Aparition consisting of 28 days, vulgarly divided
into four weeks.

The Month Medicinal contains (according to Galen) 26 days and a half,
and is also divided into 4 weeks.

The last is the month of Consecution, being a space of time that the Moon
departing from conjunction with the Sun, passes round about the circls of
the Zodiac, returning to ye point where she left the Sun, finishing her
Month of Peragration, but finding the Sun not there, because he is carried
by his own proper motion near one sign further, she is forced to spend two
days, 4 hours, 44 I. 3 II. and 16 III. to overtake the Sun, before she can
come into conjunction again: so that this month is produced unto 29 days and
a half, etc. and is called the Month of Consecution: for that the Moon
prosecutes to overtake the Sun.

CHAP. XIX. Of the Lunar Year, both Common and Extraordinary.
OF Lunar years there be two kinds, the one is called in Latin Annus
Communis, the other Embolismalis. The common Lunar year is the space of 12
Moons (not Months) or changes, which the Latins call Lunations, it is called
the common year Lunar, in respect of his accord with the Solar year: for as
the one contains 12 Moons Lunar: so the other consists of 12 months Solar,
the one having 365 days, the other 354 days; (but in both there is omission
of fractions) so that the Solar year exceeds the common Lunar year, 11 days,
of which the Epact is made.

The year called Annus Embolismalis, is a space of 13 Moons, containing 384
days, so that this year exceeds the common Lunar year 30 days, and the
Solar year 19 days, it is called Embolismus ab Embolismo, as Bissextilis is a
Bis sex, Sacro Bosco castles it Embolismus ab (...), which is quiddam insertum.

CHAP. XX. Of the Solar year, and the Etymology thereof.
THe Astronomers make many divisions of this Solar year, which are not much
needful to be known, in respect of this Treatiss. To be therefore short, the
Solar year is a space of time that the Sun by his proper motion departing
from some point in the Eclipticke, returns to the same place again: and this
year Solar is either Astronomicall, or Poetical; the Astronomicall year is
either Tropicall, or Sidereall; and the Tropicall year is either Equal or
Unequal. The Tropicall year takes his beginning from the Vernall Equinox,
containing 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 15 seconds, and 46 thirds, but the
unequal or aparent Tropical year contains sometime more, as 365 days, 5
hours, 56 minutes, 53 seconds, and 1 third; and other times less, as 365
days, 5 hours, 42 minutes, 38 seconds, and 27 thirds: And this vnequality is
made by the unequal precession of the Equinoctial points.

The Egyptians wanting the use of letters, set forth the year like an Adder
eating her own tail: so that it may be said, Annus ab Anguis a Snake; we
may depaint the year by a King, in respect they both turn round in
themselves: so may it be called Annus from Annulus, a King: for a motion in a
King finished, begins again without end, and therefore Virgil Atque in se
sua per vostigia voluitur Annus. Some call a year, Annus ab innouatione,
because the strength and virtue of all vegetable things is renewed, and are
passed over by the course of time: It is called Annus ab An, which is Circum,
and eo in, by reason of the foresaid revolution of Time.

CHAP. XXI. Of the Julian year, or our vulgar year, and of the Leap-yeare,
and the cause thereof, with the diverse beginnings of years.
IVlius Caesar, anno mundi, 3925.45 years before the birth of Christ, and the
year before his bloody death noting the falsenesse of the year then used, by
the Council of Sosigenes, an excellent Mathematitian, made the year to
consist of 365 days and 6 hours, and because it would be very difficult to
computate these 6 hours every year: for should you begin this year at 12 of
the clock and 6 hours, it must end the next year at 12 and 6 hours, and the
next year following would end at midnight, etc. So that we should drive the
beginning of the year every 4 years a day further, without the getting of a
day: so that in 124 years, the Annuntiation of Mary would fall to be where
Saint Mark Evangelist is, or a day sooner. To avoid which inconvenience Caesar
concluded, that at every four years there should be a day gotten by the
surplus of the 6 hours in every year: for 4 times 6 make 24 hours, which day
he added to February, for that it is the shortest month, and according to ye
ancient, and also according to our Churches account, the last month; and this
day they put at the 25 of February, so that the letter F is twice repeated,
Saint Mathias day being observed upon the later, according to the verse
Bissextum sextae Martis tenuere Calendae,
Posteriore die celebrantur festa Mathiae.
So that the Julian year is twofold, as Julian and Bissextill, it is called
Bissextill, of bis and sex, because the 6 Kalends of March is twice repeated:
so may it be called Annus intercalaris, because of the day that is put
between: so may February in that respect be called Mensis intercalaris, and so
may the 25 of February, that year, be called Dies intercalaris.

But since the Romans have found that this Julian year was too great, and by
help of Antonius Lilius, they have abated the quantity of the year, making it
to consist of 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 12 seconds, whereby their
account in the celebration of the festival days, and of the times of the
year, differs 11 days from ours, as in my Calendar; and yet is neither of
these accounts precisely true, by occasion of the unequal precession of the
Equinoctial points, of which here is no place to speak.

By this that is said, in the Chapters before, you may gather that a week has
seven days, or 168 hours; a month 4 weeks, 30 days, or 720 hours (I
speak of Solar months;) and a year 52 weeks, 12 months, 365 days, or 8760
hours: But the leap year has 366 days, or 8784 hours, wanting indeed,
according unto true calculation 47 minutes, and 12 seconds, and so much does
every four years differ from our Julian year, which is 11 minutes, and 48
seconds every year.

And you must note, that according unto diverse men, the year has diverse
beginnings, which some call Era; Numa Pompilius did begin the year at the
Hyemall Solstitiall, because as then the Sun began to ascend.

Romulus began the year at the Equinoctial of March, because as then all
things began to flourish, all trees and plants to bud, etc.

The Arabians begin their year at the Estiuall Solstitiall, because they are
of opinion yt the Sun was made in Leo. Some let their year take beginning at
the Autumnall Equinoctial. The Egyptians count from the death of
Nabuchadonozor; the Persians from Iezdegird, the Arabians or Moors, from the
preaching of Mahomet, who was after the birth of Christ, 626 years. The
Astronomers begin their year the first of January, and so do we take it
vulgarly in England: But the Church of England, and the date of all writings,
and such like, has their year to begin upon the 25 day of March. The Jews
began their year after two sorts, viz, for feasts in March, and for other
affairs in September: And so must we understand Ezechiel, chap. 40. verse. 1.
The Spaniards did reckon their year for tributes, and all other payments, from
the Emperor Octauian, until King John altered it to the Nativity of our Lord;
and you shall note that it was 500 years after the birth of Christ, that the
Christians did begin their year at the Annunciation of Mary.

CHAP. XXII. Vulgar errors reformed.
I Told you before in what time the Sun did finish his course through the 12
signs of the Zodiaque, and here you must know further, that he has three
motions, as slow, being in Apogaeon, or his greatest Eccentricity, and then
goes not above 57 minutes, 18 seconds in 24 hours, and sometime but 56
minutes, 43 seconds. Swift, being in Perigaeon, or nearest the earth, and then
may go one degree, 1 minute, and 43 seconds in 24 hours: and his mean
motion, at what times he passes 59 minutes, and 8 seconds in 24 hours, by
occasion whereof diverse things happen contrary, as the vulgar take it, as there
be more days by about 10 from the Equinoctial of March unto the Equinoctial
of September, then there is from the Equinoctial of September to the
Equinoctial of March.

By occasion of this diversity of the Suns motion, the vulgar be also much
deceived, that say that the days do lengthen and shorten one hour every 15
days, which is false, indeed from the 11 of March unto the 27 of April that
proportion is true: but then from the 27 of April it must be to the 17 day of
May, which is 20 days before the day be an hour longer, and then from the 17
of May (at what time the day is 16 hours long in the latitude of 52 degrees,
and 20 minutes) unto the 12 of June, which is 26 days, the day does but
lengthen half an hour and 3 minutes. The like it does in shortning.

Another error do they run into concerning the Dogge-dayes, wherein the old
Computation was much to blame, in pretending a certainty for the beginning of
them the 6 of July, and ending the 17 of August, which is false, as I noted in
my Almanacke 1607: But as there, so also in this Calendar shall they be truly
placed: the effect of the Star Plin. reports, lib. 1. chap. 40. of his
Natural History.

Another error most run into, concerning the primeing of the moon: for it
is not (as they suppose) always upon the 5 day, it contains a half quarter
of yt Moon, and happens she being 3 days and 18 hours old, being then 4
points of the compass to the Eastward of the Sun.

Also you shall note that when the horns of the Moon hang perpendicular one
over the other, then the Moon is 90 degrees of the Eclipticke above the
Horizon; if the upper horn incline more into the East then the lower horn
does, then she is short of 90 degrees: but if the upper horn be more into the
West, the Moon is more then 90 degrees of the Eclipticke from the Horizon: but
this is not meant degrees of altitude, taken instrumentally.

CAAP. XXIII. Of the Kalends, Nones, etc. And what they be.
YOu must know that in every month there be three principal days, which (as
the Romans pleased) gave denomination to all the rest of the days in the
year, and they be called Kalends, Nones, and Ides.

The Kalends be the first day of every month, from which the days are
accounted backwards, calling the next day in this regression, Pridie Calendas,
as the last of March is Pridie Calendas Aprilis; they were called Kalends, or
Calendae, as it were Colendae, because in old time they were used to sanctify
the first day of every month in honor of Juno: and therefore Ovid said:
Vendicat Ausonias Iunonis cura Calendas. Or they be called Kalends of (...)
Calo, which is voco, to call, because the first day of every month the
Pontifex minor standing in an eminent place of ye City, did make 4 calls or
more, according to the number of days, that the Faires, called Nundinae,
should endure: and therefore in the plural number they be called Calendae, as
it were calls.

Or they may be called Kalendae, Kalends, a (...), which is Bonum, because the
first day of every month one friend was accustomed mutually to give certain
gifts or presents to another, to the end that all the month following, there
might happen to them bonum omen.

Now the Nones be certain days placed in every month, whereof the most has
but 6, and the month yt has least, 4. they begin at the Ides, and end at the
Kalends: they take their name (as some say) of Non, because during that time,
the Romans sanctified no day to their God, as may appear by Ovid: Nonarum
tutela Deo caret, etc.

Or they might be called Noue, by reason of the renouation of their images
every month: or they are called Nonae, a Nundinis, which is Faires, or
markets, because the number of Nones, limited the duration thereof in every
month.

Lastly, about the midst of every month there be certain days called Ides,
which is (as it were) Divisions: for they divide every month into 2 parts, and
are a number of 8 days, which in every month (according to the order of days
in our Calendar) follow the Nones, according to the verse.

Octo tenent Idus menses generaliter omnes. But some months have more Nones
then others, as in the verse.

Mar. Ma. lul. Oct. senas, reliquis dato bis duo Nonas. Therefore if you take
all the Nones and Ides, of every month, and add them together, substracting
the whole from the number of days in the month, then is the remainder the
number of Kalends in that month; and as there is Pridie Kalendas, so there is
Pridie Nonas, and Pridie Idus.

And you must know, that amongst the ancient Astronomers, there be certain
unfortunate days in every month, the which in many matters they held ominous
and fatal: but of the truth thereof let them judge that are obseruers thereof;
only I will set them down, lest of some the book be condemned for their
absence, and in such sort as no one as yet has observed.

CHAP. XXIIII. Of the unfortunate and fatal days of the year, as also of the
good and happy days.
January the 1.2.4.5.10.15.17.19. February the 8.10. and the 17. March the
15.16. and the 19. April the 16. and 21. Not so evil the 7.8.10.20. May the
7.11.20. Not so bad the 3. and 5. June the 4. and 7. Not so evil. 10.15.22.
July the 15.20. August the 19.20. These not so bad, 1.29. and 30. September the
6 and 7. Not so bad, the 3.4.21.22. October the 5. Not so bad, the 3.16.24.
November the 15.19. Not so bad 5.6.28.29. December the 6.7.9. Not so evil the
15.17.22.
Furthermore, Astrologers will have in every Moon 2 unfortunate days, wherein
they recount it most unhappy to begin or undertake any kinds of worldly
affairs, and they repute them right perilous many ways else, the which days
follow.

In January the 3 and 4 day of the new Moon. February the 5 and 7. March the 6
and 7. April the 5 and 8. May the 8 and 9. June the 5 and 15. July the 3 and
13. August 8 and 13. September 8 and 13. October 5 and 12. November the 5 and
9. December the 3 and 13.

Again, there be six most unfortunate days chosen out of the whole year by
some, wherein they advertise no man to bleed, because of great danger of death:
and for that the effects of the Constellations work most wonderful to death,
and otherwise be right unfortunate: It is therefore very ill to have a child
borne in them, for fear of an evil death; and bad and unhappy they be in
other humane affairs, as ye ancients teach, and they be.

January the 3 day. July the 1. October the 2. April the 30. August the 1. and
the 31.

Moreover, in every month there were two days which were called Aegri, mali,
and Aegyptiaci, they be called Aegri, ab effectu, because, according to the
opinion of many, if any fell sick in any of these days, they should hardly or
never escape it: They be called Mali, because it was naught to begin any kind
of work, by reason of the evil affections of the Constellations: They be
called Aegyptiaci, because they were invented of the Egyptians: and they do
also note unto us the 10 plagues of Egypt in these verses:

Sanguis, rana, culex, muscae paruae, pecus, vlcus;
Grando, locustae, nox, mors, prius orta necant.
Blood, frogs, lice, flies, all cattle lost their breath,
Plague, hail, locusts, night, no man escaped death.
Now these unfortunate days were noted always in the Roman Calendar,
notwithstanding ye inhibition of Augustine, saying: Calendas mensium, and dies
Aegyptiacos, non obseruetis. But yet to satisfy all, take them in the ensuing
verses.

Armis Gunfe. Dei Kalatos, Adamare dabatur.
Linamemor, Constans gelidos, Infancia quosdam.
Omne limen, Aaron bagis, Concordia laudat.

Of the words in these four verses, every two serve for one month, the first
standing for January: If therefore you desire to know the first of the two
former fatal days in any month, count so many days from the beginning of
the month descending, as the first letter in the first word is distant from A
inclusiuely, according to the Alphabet, and where that number ends, there is
the fatal day; as in April L. (beginning Lixa) is the 10 letter in the
Alphabet, therefore the 10 day is fatal, and according to the number of the
first letter (in the order of ye Alphabet) of the second syllable, ye said
hour of yt said day is vehemently to be suspected.

But to have the second fatal day of the month, you must reckon so many days
from the last day of the month ascending, as the number of yt first letter of
the second word, for yt month, comes unto in the order of the Alphabet, as
in April M. for Memor, is the 11 letter in the Alphabet, therefore the 11 day
before the last of April is a fatal day which is the 19 day of April, and so
as before, the first letter of the second syllable does show the most
unfortunate hour, according to the number thereof in the Alphabet, and you
must note, that H in this account is taken for no letter.

Again, there be certain unfortunate and bad days in ye year, called
Dog-daies, as before is remembered.

Likewise through England, the 28 of December, being Innocents day, is called
Crosse-day, and so is it accounted every week.

There be other days recounted in a little foolish book, called the Book of
Knowledge, taken according to the course of the Moon, as thus: The first day
of the Moon Adam was made, and that he counts a fortunate day, but it is
false: for Adam was not made the first day of the Moon; for the fourth day of
the creation was the Sun and Moon made, and Adam the 6 day: so that the Moon
was made 2 days before Adam, and what virtue should the moon receive by the
creation of Adam. The like error is upon the 2 day of the moon for Eve, and
so of the rest, which since their errors is apparent, they be better omitted
the repeated and for the truth of the rest I commend to your experience.

And you must note that there be other days unfortunate and evil, caused by
the motions of the stars and planets and by the aspects of the Moon to the
rest of the 6 planets, as in the ensuing table is compendiously to be seen.

A Table of the Moons Aspects to
Conjunction Sextile. Quadrat. Trine. Opposition Saturn An unfortunate day;
Journey not to princes converse not with old me^, fly husbandme^, and Rural
laborers. Iovne with rural people, till the earth, plant trees, vines, and
such like: But do not seek the love of women. Confer not with Princes and
aged men, abstain from physic and iournies, seek not thy desire. Accompany
rural people, repair thy house, plant vines, and till thy ground. Entertain
no servant, begin, nor undertake no kind of thing. Jupiter. A fortunate day;
Go unto great men, and Rulers expect good council, and justice. Accompany
Lawyers, and Ecclesiastical men, read law and statutes. Study Philosophy, and
you may entreat of Law matters, as judgments, etc. Begin all honest works,
repair and seek to Kings, Prelates, and Judges, it is good to meet them. Take
thy journey, it is good to meet with persons Ecclesiastical. Mars. An
unfortunate day; Take no journey, avoid Soldiers and warfaring men. Buy
weapons and horses for war, take iourny toward war, deal with Alchimy, and
fire works. A day of fear, beware of contention, the peace and truce shall
not hold. Dispose of all things necessary for war, buy horses of war, make
experience in alchimy Take no journey, hire no servant, seek no love of women,
avoid company of any Sol. Begin nothing, but what thou would should be kept
close and secret. Repair to Kings, Princes, etc. Effect thy business, expect
the office and dignity sought. Take heed of princes and great men: for this
day is to be shund in all affairs. Give gifts to Kings and great men, ask and
have, a league betwixt kings shall hold. Come not before great me^ avoid this
day in all thy affairs as most unfortunate. Venus. Days of preasure; put on
new apparel, seek the Love of women, now they be tractable, ask and have.
Good to seek love of women, take a wife, women be fond. Hire thy servant,
days of sport, put on new apparel, and take a wife. Comb thy hair, seek
the love of women, set thy children to school, put on new apparel, in all let
not the be in Leo Hire servants, take thy journey, proceed in matrimony, it is
a day of pleasure and content. Mercury. Begin Calculations and writings,
exe^cise merchandise, let the Ambassador, or Messenger proceed. Write Letters,
seek Offices^, set children to ^choole, accom^anying wittmen, and Singers. Let
Ambassadors, Messengers, or posts proceed journey, excellent to buy or sell.
Poets be busy, make verses, exercise thy things witty, let thy Children go to
school. Accompany Penne-men, send messengers, take a journey, exercise the
Mathematickes.

And you must not, yt yt fortunate planets be Jupiter and Venus; yt unfortunate
and wicked are Saturn and Mars; the indifferent be Sol, Mercury, and Luna.

So that the Conjunction of the good, is good; of the evil, had; and of the
indifferent, indifferent, excepting the Sun and Moon.

Also the good in Conjunction with yt bad, is bad; the good with the mean is
indifferent, and the bad with the mean is bad.

Certain days of the year be also good or bad, according to the place of the
Moon in ye heavens, and those places be called Mansions, as in the Table,
according to which the temperature and quality of the day is much altered.

CHAP. XXV. To find what Planet does reign any hour in the year, and how
long he reigns.
TO go briefly to work, resolve the hours of the day into minutes, by
multiplying them by 60, adding to the product the odd minute, the total then
divided by 12, does tell you how long a planet does reign: The like for the
night. But for the more ease behold the ensuing Table.

A Table of the Inequall, Temporal, or Planetary hours for every day and
night in the year.

The use of the precedent Table.
In the first row upon the left hand find the lenghth of the day or night in
hours, and if there be any minutes annexed, find them in the top of the Table,
where they be set thus: 0, 12, 24, 36, 48. And so in the common angle shall
you find the length of the planetary hour for the day or night, under their
proper Title, and if you want the just minute, take the nearest, for the
difference produces no sensible error: as when the day is 16 hours, 24
minutes long then the length of a planetary hour for day is 1 hour, 22 minutes,
and aplanet rules that night but 38 minutes, as in the Table.

The length of a planetary hour thus found, it rests to find any time of day
what planetary hour it is, which as yet none of these little books have
taught: You must therefore learn (as hereafter) at what hour and minute the
Sun does rise upon the day proposed, and also ye true hour of the day at the
time proposed, by some clock, or rather Sunne-diall, and thereby get how many
hours and minutes the said proposed time is after Sun rising, the number of
which hours multiply by 60, and to the product add the odd minute: then the
total divided by the number of minutes, that a planet reigns, the quotient
is the number of the planetary hour.

Example.
The Sun rises at 8 of the clock (upon a certain day) which day is 8
hours long, and I am required to find what planetary hour it was at 10
before Noone: 10 is two hours after 8, 2 multiplied by 60, yeeldes 120. which
parted by 40 minutes (for so long a Planet rules that day, as in the Table)
and the quotient is 3. Therefore I conclude it is the third planetary hour,
and if there had been any minutes remaining, those would have shown how many
minutes of the planetary hour had been spent.

Deal so with the night, counting them from Sun set.

Otherwise.
Another way I can show you; having any time of the day given, and are required
to know what planetary hour it is at that instant, you must consider if the
question were made before high noone, or after: if the question were made
before noone, work as before: if after noone, add the hour of the clock
after noone to the hour and minute of Sun setting: so have you the distance
of time from Sunrising, then work likewise as before.

Lastly, having found what planetary hour it is, then must you seek what
planet does reign that hour, which is thus done: Consider what planet the day
is called by, as in the 15 Chapter, and give to that planet the first hour,
and to the next the second hour, until you come to ye hour proposed, and
that planet which falls to that hour is the planet ye rules at that time.
But for more ease behold the ensuing Table, which I have newly made for that
purpose.

A Table to find what Planet does rule every hour by day or night.

The use of the Table.
Seek the day proposed in the top of the Table, and in one of the two rows
under the same day, find the planetary hour, against which in the first row
upon the left hand is the character of the planet that governs that hour of
the day, under the title of Day Re. signifying Regniments of the day planets,
and upon the right hand is the planet that rules that hour of the night,
under Night Regniment, as upon Sunday, Mercury rules the third hour of the
day, and Sol the same hour of the night.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the natures and properties of the seven Planets.
SOmething I would say, that when you have found what planet reigns, you
might likewise know the nature and condition thereof,, but I must be brief:
for indeed here is no place in this small volume to handle the same in such
ample manner as it ought to be.

Saturn (being well affected) is grave with authority, thinking of deep
matters, disputing of gravity alouer of secret matters, silent, solitary,
laborious, doing labor and toil, a gatherer of wealth, covetous, desirous of
money, and studious for his own proper benefit, a Zelotype, bearing care of
his body, uncertain in keeping promise, a lover of husbandry; and being made
unfortunate and weak, he is an abject, squalid, excogitating of base things, a
pick, thank and complainer, fearful, avoiding light, loving solitariness,
sad, envious, stubborn, suspicious, superstitious, untrimmed, malignant
deceiptfull, yet fearing deceit, covetous, austere, slothful, dull and a
liar: His nature is cold and dry, and is charactred thus.

Jupiter being the only signifier and well affected, makes men honest,
religious, just, doers of good turns, magnanimous, faithful, verecundious,
beneuolent, manly famous governors, of great diligence, grave, and modest,
given to follow their business, wise careful to live, lovers of their own,
and of their friends, liverall, and without fraud: But being euilly affected,
is more prodigal and proud: His nature is hot and moist, thus figured.

Mars, well affected, is generous, fit for government and rule, valiant,
strong, angry, given to battle and war with vehemence, apt, without fraud,
fearing no danger, desiring revenge, impatient of servitude and injuries,
vaunting, not respective of riches: and being euilly affected, is cruel,
unjust, a brawler, a tyrant, a murderer, dreadful, rash, unfearful, proud,
drunk. turbulent, a blond-shedder, fierce in provoking quarrels, and fearful
to perform, the author of discords, arrogance and seditious: He is hot and
dry, thus charactred.

Sol is the most noble Planet, he is magnanimous, industrious, provident,
ambitious, signifying Kings Princes, Potentates, laborers of gold, he is
valiant, secret, honest, quiet, gives long life, and a healthful body, a
sincere and very good mind, princely dignities, and riches, and above the
rest, he makes men courteous famous wise, rulers, lovers, desirous of honors:
His Nature is hot and dry choleric, and is thus charactred.

Venus fortunatly affected, makes one faire-spoken, good, a lover of sweet
things, pleasant, merry, fair, delicate in gesture, elegant, a doer of
good-turnes, pitiful, given to please, and apt to pleasures, given to singing
and dancing, impatient of labor, gallant, and yielding love to such,
sociable, yet serving God religiously: But being euilly affected, she is
effeminate, fearful, a lover of maids, spending much upon them, without
respect of fame or infamy, idle, sluggish, apt to lust, a Zelotype, or given to
jealousy: Her nature is cold and moist, flegmaticke, thus charactred.

Mercury well situate, and fortunate affected, causes a sharp wit, makes
one studious, capable of learning, easy to be taught, wise, subtle, wary, and
heedfull, accomplishing all things with great dexterity, obtaining a great part
of Poetry, Geometry, and the Mathematickes, without tutor, desiring many
differences, and disputing elegantly of many matters, of good manners, wittily
applying himself to time and place, an imitator of the good: But being
unfortunate and badly situate, he is maleuolent, malicious, subtle, crafty,
forsworn, lying, especially his essential dignities being of the bad, and he
near the Dragons tail, for then he is most ill.

The Moon makes one thoughtfull, unstable, vagabonds, fearful,
faint-hearted, prodigal, she signifies messengers, shipmen, Queens, Ladies,
also common people, fishers, and such that deal about waters, also such that
are in continual motion, as Lackies, etc. Also Widows, mothers, etc. she
makes one delighting to study histories, to walk from place to place, to
Nauigate, plant, etc.

CHAP. XXVII. A brief discourse of the natural causes of watery Meteors, as
snow, hail, rain, etc.
YOu must first understand, that all watery meteors, as rain, snow, or such
like, is but a moist vapor drawn up by the virtue of the Sun, and the rest of
the Planets into the middle region of the air, where being congealed or
dissolved, falls upon the earth, as hail or rain.

Of the Rainbow.
Pliny says the Rainbow is made by the Sunbeams striking upon a hollow
cloud, when their edge is repelled, and beaten back against ye Sun, and thus
arises variety of colors, by ye mixture of clouds, air, and fiery light
together. But (as he says) it pretends neither fair nor foul wether.

Of Rain.
Of these kind of meteors you may read Arist. libro primo Meteorologicorum,
cap. 1. and 2. But briefly, Rain is a cold vapor, and earthly humor, raised
from the earth and waters into the middle region of the air, where by the
extremity of cold it is thickened into the body of a cloud, and after being
dissolved, falls upon the earth.

Of Hail.
Hail is engendered of Rain, congealed into Ice, freezing the drops presently
after the dissoluing of the cloud, whereby we have great irregular stones fall
on the earth; I have seen them in that fashion 1610 contain 4 inches about:
for the higher it comes, and the longer it tarieth in the air, the rounder
it is and the lesser.

Of Snow.
Snow is of the same humor that Hail is, but not grown together so hard.
Pliny says, Hail sooner melts then Snow, and that Hail comes oftener in the
day then in the night.

Of Frost and Dew
When in the day time through ye faint heat of the Sun, there is a cold and
moist vapor drawn up a little from the earth, presently at night it
descends again upon the the earth, and is called Dew, and in the Spring or
Harvest, it is a sign of fair weather; but if by means of cold it be
congealed, it is called Frost, and therefore Dewes come not so often in hot
seasons, neither when winds be up, but after a calm and clear night, frosts
dry up wet and moisture: For when (as Pliny says) the Ice is melted, the like
quantity of water in proportion is not found.

Of Wind.
Wind is nothing but many exhalations drawn from the earth and enforced
laterally above the sun.

Of Sudden Blasts.

A windy exhalation being thrown down, and encompassed (as Pliny says) in a
thin course of clouds newly ouer-cast coming at some time with such a
violence, as it bursts and cleaues a dry cloud in sunder, and makes a storm,
of the Greeks called Ecnephias, but when this cleft is not great, but that the
winds us forced to turn round, and role in this descent without lighting,
there is made a whirle-puffe, or ghust, called Typhon, which is to say, the
storm Ecnephias, sent forth and winding violence, and this wind does bear
many things away with it, changing from place to place; but if the hole in the
cloud were great, it is called Turbo, casting down and overthrowing all that
is next it. Pliny says, no Ecnephias comes with snow, nor no Typhon from the
South: some say, vinegar thrown into this wind, breaks the gust.

Of Earthquakes.
Plenty of winds gotten into the bowels holes and corners of the earth
bursting out of the earth, and the earth closing again, causes the shaking,
or earthquake, and is a token of ensuing war.

Signs of Earthquakes.
When waters in well or pits be troubled, and have a bad savor, the long
absence of ye winds, strange noises, the obscurity or darkness of the Sun
with clouds, and strangly colored, etc.

Of Thunder and Lightnings.
When an exhalation hot and dry mixed with moisture, is carried up into the
middle region and there enclosed in the body of a cloud: Now these two
contraries being thus shut or pent up in one room together, they fall at
variance, whereby the water and fire agree not until they have broken the
prison wherein they were pent, so that fire and water fly out of the cloud,
the breaking whereof makes a noise, like the renting of cloth, which we call
thunder, and the fire lightning, the thunder being made first, but the
lightning first seen, in respect the sight is before the hearing; and of
lightnings there be many sorts.

That which is dry burns not at all, dissipating and dispersing: that which
is moist burns not likewise, but blasts, and alters the color: but that
which is clear is of a strange operation, it draws vessels dry without hurt
to the vessel; it melts metal in bags or purses, and hurts not the
bag or purse, nor the wax that sealed the bag hurt; it breaks the bones,
and hurts not the flesh; and kills the child in the womb, not hurting the
mother. Pliny says, Scythia by reason of cold, and Egypt by reason of heat,
have seldom lightning.

What things be not hurt with lightning.
It hurts not ye Laurel tree, it enters not past 5 foot into the earth, such
that are shadowed with the skins of Seals, or Sea-calues, are freed, the
Eagle is free, etc. Many other wondrous and strange kind of Meteors be there
in the heavens often times seen, as Comets, burning Dragons, etc. but this
volume will not contain an ample discourse thereof.

CHAP. XXVIII. Diverse signs to prognosticate what weather is toward.
TO begin first with the Sun, the best prognosticator of all other, if he
rise clear, not fiery red, if he chase the clouds before him into the West; if
at Sunne-rising there be a circle about the Sun, and it vanish equally away,
if he be red at setting: all these argue fair wether to ensue. But if he be
fiery red at his rising, if he show pale and wan, if at rising he seem
hollow, if red and black clouds be about him at his rising, or if his rays
be red both at a rising and setting, if his beams at a morning or evening be
contracted or short, if it rain at Sunne-setting, or his rays look dark or
blew, or gather, if at his rising his beams seem not bright and clear, if
before his rising the clouds gather like globes moving not into the west, if a
circle of clouds appear incompassing the Sun, leaving not all his light, if
his circle about the Sun be broke, if at his rising he cast his beams a far
off amongst the clouds, if he spread his beams before he be up, if at his
setting he be ouercast with a thick miss: all these signify wet, and often
tempestious wether. Also look if the circle called Halo, be black, for if
signifies rain, and if it break, winds, from that part as the fraction in
the circle respects.

Presages by the Moon.
According to the Egyptians, if on the Prime day the Moon be fair and
bright, it will be fair; if red, winds; if dim and blackish, foul wether
according to the verse.

Pallidaluna pluit, rubicunda slat, alba serenat. Mark the typs of her horns
when she is five days old, with Pl. But best when she is primed, if they be
blunt, rain; if pricking upward, and sharpa-pointed, winds. Pliny says,
these things fall truest upon the fourth day. If her upper horn, which bends
northwards, be only sharp and pricked, winds from that coast: but if the
nether horn be so, winds from the South; if the fourth day after her change
she have a red circle or Halo about her, winds and rain. Varro says, when
the Moon is 4 days old, if she put her horns direct and straight forth, it
is tempest at sea, unless there be a clear circle about her: If the one
half of the full Moon seem pure, fair wether; if red, winds; if blackish,
rain; mistes and clouds about the Moon have like effect, as Halo, the more
the worse, whilst the new Moon is Croissant and rising with the upper tip of
her horn blackish, tells of wet after the full: but then other tip being so,
rain before the full: and if (as Varro says) this blackishnesse appear in
the midst of the Moon, rain at the full: a circle about the full Moon
declares winds from that part that the circle is most splendant; if her
horns at her rising show more gross and thick then ordinary, look for rain
plentiously, and that before long: if she appear not before the Prime, the
West wind blowing withal, cold winterlike wether all that Moon. Lastly with
Pliny, there be 8 points in every Moon, and so many days (according as she
falls upon the angles of the Sun) which many only observe, and take their
presages of future wetherby, to wit, the 3.7.11.15.19.21.27. and the very day
of conjunction.

Presages by the Stars.
Next unto the Moon we may place ye Stars; if the Stars seem to shoot,
winds from that quarter the Star came from: the wetter the Spring and
Summer, the dryer the Autumn. Autumn fair and dry brings a windy Winter: a
circle about any of the other Planets, great showers: if the cloud in Cancer,
called Praesepe, or the manger standing betwixt Aselli, or ye little Asses
appear not, though otherwise the air be clear, foul winterlike wether: if
the Northern of these stars be hid, great winds from the South, but the
other being hid, North-east winds.

Of the Rainbow.
If two Raine-bowes appear, rain: a Rainbow presently after rain, fair
wether.

Presages from Thunder and Lightning.

If in summer there be more thunder then lightning, winds from the coast it
thundered; but if the lightning exceed, rain: lightning without thunder,
betokens rain and thunder: if it lighten only from the North-west, rain the
ensuing day; if from the North, winds thence; if from ye South-North-west, or
full west if lighten, especially in the night, wind and rain from those
coasts: morning thunder, winds; but midday thunder, rain.

Presages by the Clouds.
If the rack ride apace in the air, winds from that coast they come, the
worse if it come from the North or South: if at Sunne-set the racks ride on
both sides fromwards him, tempest: black clouds flying out of the East, rains
at night: but from the west, rain the next day: if the clouds be disparkled
many together of the East, flying like fleeces of wool, rain for 3 days
after: when clouds fly low, seeming to settle upon the tops of hills, cold
wether insueth; but the mountain tops being fair and clear, the wether will
take up: if the clouds seem full charged, and yet look white withal, which
constitution of the air is called by some Towers, by others white wether,
hail is at hand.

If mistes come down from the hills, or descend from the Heavens, and settle in
the Valleys, it promises fair hot wether: mists in the evening show a hot
day on the morrow. The like when white mistes rise from waters in the Evening.

Prognostications by fires.
From the heavens we will proceed to our common fires.

The fire burning pale, or keeping a huzzing noise, stormy wether: if the flame
of fire or candle mount, winding and wauing, as it were, winds: the like if the
fire or candle go out of it self, or kindle and take fire with much ado.
Further, when you discern many sparkles gather together in the fire, knitting
one to another, the coals hanging to the bottom, or side of the pot newly
taken off the fire, the fire raked in the imbers, keeps a spitting and
sparkling from it, if the ashes upon the earth grow together, or when the live
coal shines brighter, or burns more then ordinary: all these be tokens of
rain.

Prognostications by water.
If the sea, within the haven, after the departing of the flood in a low ebb
water be calm, and yet keep a noise and rumbling within, wind; if it do thus
by fits, cold wether and rain; if in a calm season the sea strond, or
water-bankes resound or make a noise, great tempest: the like of the sea it
self; the puffins swimming above water, tell of cold wether for many days:
the sea being calm, heauing and puffing up, shows there is great store of
winds within her, which will shortly breaks out to a tempest.

Prognostications from Fishes and Fowls.
The Dolphin disporting upon the waves, foreshewes winds: if they fling and
dash the water this and that way, and the sea be rough, fair wether: the
Cuttle, or little Calamaria Loligo launcing and flying about the water, the
Cockles, or Winckles sticking hard to the gravel, the Seavrchings thrusting
themselves into the mudde, or covered with sand, the croking extraordinary of
Frogs, the low flying of Swallows, the chirping of Sparrowes, the crying of
Peacockes and Hearnes, the bathing of Crows, the stinging of of Flies and
Gnats, the early straggling of Seamewes the proking of their feathers by the
Guls, Malards and Duckes, all foreshew wind or rain. Contrary the Water-fowle
gather together and combat, or Cranes make haste to fly into the midst of
the land, or Cormorants and Guls forsaking the waters, or Cranes soring quietly
aloft, or Crows or Ravens gaying against the Sun, are all tokens of fair
wether. But if the Howlat cry Chi-uit, rain: Ravens crying one to another, as
if they sobbed and vexed, clapping themselves with their wings, winds: but
doing it by interualles of time, wet and wind: the late returning home of
Iacke-dawes, hard wether: also yt working of the spinner, the busy heauing of
Moles, the appearing of worms, Hens resorting to the roost covered with
dust, the Ante busied with her Eggs, the Bees in fair wether not wandering
far abroad, Bells heard further then ordinary, the wallowing of dogs, the
alteration of the crowing of the Cock, befoken all foul wether.

Prognostications of foure-footed Beasts.
The leaping and playing of sheep, and such small cattle, show alteration of
wether: the crying of Swine, Oxen and beasts licking themselves against the
hair, or holding up their nose and smelling into to the air, swine shaking
hay, or such like stuff: beasts eating greedily, or licking their hooues, or
suddenly move here and there: all signify rain or foul wether.

Prognostications from woods, stones, etc.
The herb Trefoile looks rough against a tempest, and the leaves thereof
will stand staring up, as if it were afraid thereof. Also if dishes, stones, or
such like, sweat or be wet: if wainescot doors that join well, be stubborn
to open, if salt dissolve in the salt-saller, or any solid body sweat, look
for great rain: the like is seen by the pissing of Dogs.

If there be a rumbling noise, or sounding in the mountains and forests, or
if the leaves of trees flicker and play themselves, no wind stirring, which
foretell some change of wether: the like prediction is gathered by the light
down of Poplares or Thistles flying to and fro in the air: look what is said
of the noise in forests, understand the same here in vallyes, and in the air.
I cannot stand to run into an ample discourse of this subject, lest I drive
the quantity of my volume beyond my intent; but they shall be amply handled in
a Book I have to come forth, called Cosmologia and Meteorologia.

CHAP. XXIX. Of the four quarters of the year, and first of Winter.
VVINTER, the first quarter Astronomical, takes his beginning when the Sun
enters into Capricorn, during until he have gone to the latter part of
Pisces, it is the coldest time of the year, and the colder and dryer the
wholsomer, yet over much cold kills trees in a warm region, especially such
that be tender. A warm, and moist Winter is unwholesome, and an enemy to
husbandmen, but reasonable store of snow does ranken the fields and preserve
corn.

The diseases of this quarter be pushes in the face, leprosy, toothache,
red-spots, fevers, the scab, fluxes of blood by the inferior parts, pains of
the eyes, palsies, gouts, and such like.

Of the Spring.
THe Spring is the most comfortablest quarter in all the year, and is of
nature warm and moist, for then the Sun draws near to the Zenith, coming
toward the stars of a warm nature, and then yt East-winds blow dispearcing
the superfluous humors, making the earth apt to bring forth all things, for the
good and comfort of man: This quarter begins when the Sun enters into
Aries, at what time the days and nights be equal, and continues until the 12
of June, at what time the Sun has run through Aries, Taurus, and Gemini;
if the Spring be much moist, the fruit will be rotten and scarce, but weeds
will abound; if hoate, the trees soon bring forth leaves; the fruits of that
quarter, as Cheries, etc. will soon be ripe, which being not gathered before
their full maturity, will be subject to worms, especially in warm regions,
but it is seldom with us, though frequent in Italy. Roses will be from, but
not so sweet, and all such things shall better please the sight then yt sent or
taste; if it be cold and dry, there will hoare frosts fall in the end of the
quarter, according to the full Moon, the wine and fruits will be scarce; being
dry and not hot, fruits will be scarce but good, with want of grain; if it be
cold the fruits will be late riping; if it be wet, with much South wind, and
the former Winter dry with Northen winds, the next Summer will happen agues,
and bleerenesse, dropping of the eyes, and pain of the bowels. A dry Spring
with much Northen winds, and a wet Winter full of Southern winds going before,
causes women with child to be delivered before their time, or to bring forth
weak children. Gal. l. 3. Aphor. 3. So that if the quarter vary from his
proper nature, the commodities of the earth be made worse and scarce, the
ordinary diseases of this quarter be leaprosies, red spots, toothache, fevers
of blood, pushes or wheales in the face, smallpox, ring-wormes,
falling-sickenesse, pains in the throat and neck, the Kings evil, wens,
griefs in the shoulders and arms causes by blood.

Of Summer.
Summer is of nature hot and dry, like the fiery tryplicity, or like the
chollericke; if takes beginning when ye Sun enters Cancer, continuing until
he have passed over Cancer, Leo, and Virgo, and now is rage and choler most
abounding, being the hottest time (...) the year, but in the beginning there
rise certain^ ^^arres in Cancer, whose virtue is to make moist, especially
Aselli, so that the Sun coming to them, some rain falls, to fructify the
earth, but coming to Leo, being near Syrius and Procyon, stars of a warm
nature, the heat grows most vehement, to temperate which the Etesian winds
blow. Lastly coming to Virgo, which is a barren sign, ye constellation of
Arcturus rising, a mittigation of heat is produced, with some rain.

If Summer be over wet, the Summer fruits shall putrify, and there will be but
small store of grain, there will be many sickenesses: if it be only dry,
there will happen want of grain, and Summer fruits will be wholesome, the
fishes shall die in waters, great sicknesses will happen: if it exceed in
heat, many sicknesses also will happen with great store of Summer friutes: if
to conclude it be cold, the year will be wholesome, but the fruits rotten.

This quarter as it is hot and dry in nature, so does it accordingly alter the
humors in man's body, bringing all fruits to their ripeness, cattle to their
fatness, and men to their wealth, the sicknesses agreeing to the nature
thereof, be griefs and torments about the breast, ribs, and spleen,
pushes, leprosy, and diseases of the face as in the Spring: bleard and sore
eyes with other impediments therein, the plurisy, cough, heart and
stomacke-aking, sorrow, vexations, fevers of blood, apostumes, pestilence,
fevers, the ianndise, pains in the belly and secret parts, with other
infirmities proceeding of melancholy.

Of Autumn.
Autumn is ye fourth and last quarter Astronomicall, but the third according
to our English account, by nature is cold and dry, melancholy, like old age,
resembling the element of the earth, beginning at the Suns first ingresse
into Libra, producing thereby a second Equinoctial, cocquating the days with
the nights, which may also be called our second Spring, making an apt time to
take Physic, bleed, etc. but in that Libra is a sign of the Airy triplicity,
there is produced heat with temperate moisture, but coming to Scorpio the air
is made more cold and moist, for Scorpio is of the watery triplicity, but
coming to Sagitarius, a sign of the fiery triplicity, accompanied with
certain stars of a warm nature, there is made a restraint of the extremity
of wet and cold, for the good of such as sow and plow.

If Autumn be most moist, grapes will be putrified and wine bad, if the end be
wet there will be want of fruit the ensuing year, if the beginning be dry,
there will be penuria Milij, if hot many sickenesses and evils; if cold there
is loss of harvest fruits in quantity, juice and beauty.

The diseases of this quarter properly be pains in the back, darkness of
sight, retention of urine, fluxes of blood, pains in the back and privy
parts, with infirmities in the face, as in the Spring, also the canker,
fistuloes, emrods, the stone and gravel, fevers of blood, and impediments in
the eyes.

And here note that Winter in Latin Hyems, is so called, ab (...) which is
dimidium, for the vulgar people do divide the year into two parts, Summer and
Winter, Winter being ye greater. Ver the Spring, is so called a vireo vires,
because then omnia virent all things flourish, Aestas Summer, is so called ab
aestu: which is a feruore, by reason of heat. Lastly Autumnus, Autumn, or
Harvest, is so called a bonorum anni augmentatione, or it takes name with
Hipocrates, ab ortu Arcturi, during till the Vespertine setting of the
Pleiades, or of Autumnus, which is morbidum, or tempestiuosum: and these four
times be resembled to the four Regions of the world, to the four Cardinal
winds, to the four Elements, to the four quarters, to the four humors, and
to the four ages, as in the ensuing table.

CHAP. XXX. Certain predictions of the weather in every month, with necessary
abstracts, and the Poetical rising of the Stars.
January.
NEw-yeares day in the morning being red portends great tempest and war:
after ryseth Orions girdle Vespertine, troubling the air, causing South-west
winds, the 10 and 11 day does Lucida Corona produce by a Vespertine setting,
about which time also rises Asellus and praesepe, great causers of rain the
more Jupiter being in moist signs: ye 12 day Asellus rises Cosmicall, the 13
Praesepe sets Cosmicall: the 20 the South part of Asellus ryseth Chronicall:
the 28 Sirius rises Vespertinus: the 30 Eagle rises Cosmicall. All which with
Ptolemaeus bring wet and tempest: some say if the Sun shine the 12 of January,
there shall be much wind, others Prognosticate of Saint Paul's day, saying: if
the Sun shine it is token of a happy year, if rain or snow, indifferent: if
misty, great death, but if it thunder there will be great winds and death
that year.

The Abstract.
Cut timber, rid fruit trees of superfluous branches, uncover their roots,
drench weak and sick cattle, Kyne with veriuce, horses with water and ground
malt, fodden witha little bran, dig gardines, lib and geld for rearing.

February.
THe third day Regulus rises Chronicall, the fourth he sets Cosmicall, of
whom Ptol. says, the clear star in the heart of the Lion beginning to set,
the North wind blows, with often rain. Carda. says it raises the
South-west winds. The 9 the tail of the Dolphin does set vespertine, which
Ptol. says brings winds and snow, and the more rain the winds being south.
Some say thunder upon Shroue-tuesday foretells wind, and store of fruit, and
plenty, the Sunbeams being early abroad: others affirm that so much he
shines that day, and the like hoe shines every day in Lent.

The Abstract.
Set, cut, and lay quicke-sets and roses, sow, beans, pease, and oats,
especially the land being cold and stiff: furnish your gardens with sallads
for Summer.

March.
THe 6 day Vindemiator rises vespertine, bringing North winds with frost, the
8 rises the Rammes-horne, snow or rain: the 10 Arcturus rises Chronicall,
causing tempests. Carda: says, at the vespertine rising of this star,
Swallows be seen, and the Spring comes. Stadius cap. 7. at the vespertine
setting of Arcturus, swallows depart by multitudes, and at his vespertine
rising come again: and this rising brings South-west winds, and by-west,
blowing commonly 12 days with rain or hail, ending in the west. Herewith
agrees Ptol. Plin. Stadius, Collumell, and others, especially being furthered
with the radiation of the Moon or Mars. The 11 or 12 day Sol enters Aries,
the West winds blow, Storkes come, with Ptol. in Egypt they came the 17 of
May. The 21 Spica Virginis sets Cosmicall cloudy.

Some say, so many mistes in March, so many hoare frosts after Easter.

The Abstract.
Now (regarding wind and weather) graft, also cover the roots of your trees
opened in December or January, with rank earth: sow pease, beans, oats,
parsneps, onions, artichockes, cowcumbers, sage, and mellons; manure barley
land, but in cold clay ground sow at the end of the month.

April.
THe 17 of April, Augustus terminus Pleiadum, one of the seven stars rises
Cosmicall, the other following a little after, causing Westwindes: the 22 the
South part of Lucida Lancis sets Cosmicall, often prove king showers of
rain. Some say if it rain upon Ascension day (which sometimes falls in
April) it does betoken scarrity of all kind of food for cattle, but being
fair, it signifies plenty.

The Abstract.
Yet it is good to sow Barley, chiefly in strong land, some kind of
garden-seeds sow now also, as Mellons, Citrions, Cowcumbers, and Artichockes:
sow likewise Hemp and Flax, setting some garden-herbes toward the end of the
Month. Now the time begins to bark trees, and to yield to good Day-men
natures abundance.

May.
THe fourth of May Sirius, or Canis mayor sets vespertine, tempest from the
South and North-east, and by-north; and as Stadius says, if the full Moon
happen within two days before or after, it prognosticates blasting to corn,
and other flowers. The 6 and 7 Hyades begin to set, the South blowing with
rain: So Ptol. speaks of the setting of the 7 stars. The 9 Pleiades set
Chronicall, causing^ South winds, which with Ptol. at last turn into the West.
The 11 the Bulls Eye sets: the 18 Procyon sets Heliacall, making wine rage
in Cellers with Stadius. The 23 the Eagle rises Chronicall, which happening at
the new or full Moon, all fruits be hurt with worms and Caterpillars with
Carda. The 24 the 7 stars rise Cosmicall: the 27 the Bulls Eye rises
Cosmicall, both which fore-shew rain, and hurt to vines.

Some say, the Sun shining upon the 25 day, wines shall prosper well; also in
the end of May Oaks begin to bear blossoms, which happening fore-shewes much
tallow and fruit.

The Abstract.
In the beginning you may sow Barley, set and sow tender herbs and seeds, as
sweet-Marierome, Sommer-sauory, Basil, etc. Set Stilles to work, using, May
deaw therein stirring land for Wheat and Rye.

June.
THe 6 day the lesser Dog sets vespertine, which happening at the full
Moon, hurts all fruits. Stadius says if it happen at full Moon, it brings
mischief to sweet flowers and vines, by reason of his burning heat: The 12
Sol enters Cancer, Vine and Olives flourish: the 16 Arcturus sets Cosmicall,
making the air intemperate: the 21 ye left side of Orion rises Cosmicall,
raising the West winds. If it rain the 24 day, Hazell-nuts do not prosper.

The Abstract.
Set Gilloflowers and Rosemary, sow Lettuce 3 or 4 days after the full, which
is also good from February to the end of September: sheare sheep, fetch home
fuel, and toward the end of the month begin to mow.

July.
THe 2 day rises Orions Girdle, and is a Critical day: for if it rain this
day it does continue so often for 4. weeks. Stadius says, if Jupiter be
aspected with Mars, Mercury, or the Sun at this rising, great tempest is
portended at the rising of the great Dog, and foresheweth Northeast winds,
and by-North, corruption of the air, with the rising of the Etesian winds.
The 13 Lucida Coronae. sets Chronicall: the 23 ye North part of Asellus
sets vespertine, at which time with Ptol. the North-east, and by-East winds
blow, as forerunners of ye Etesian winds, Carda: these winds, as forerunners
of the rising of the Dog, blow 8 days before, with which Stadius agrees.
Some say, if it be fair 3 Sondayes before S. James day, corn will be good: but
wet, corn withers.

The Abstract.
At the full Moon gather flowers and seeds, and let your flowers rather dry
in the shade then the Sun: for the Sun draws away their virtue: but to
avoid corruption, before you take them away, let the Suns heat be upon them
a while. Take heed of sudden colds, for nothing sooner breeds the plague:
and therefore to drink being hot is naught. It were vain to tell good
husbands that it is now fit for them to be in meadows, and else where to
provide for Winter. Therefore I will commend this rhyme to sluggards and idle
persons.

Labor in Summer, take pains with the Ant,
Else in the Winter, live cold, and in want.
August.
THe first of August ye great Dog rises Cosmicall. Carda. says at the
rising of this star all living creatures be troubled, and that it is scarce
possible that dryness and sickness should not be. Stadius recounts many more
enormities, as troubling of wine in Cellars, Dogs going mad, fluxes of the
Seas and waters, death of fishes, with the extremity of heat, especially if
Mars or Jupiter be in fiery signs. Diaphanes says, if at the rising of the
great Dog with the Sun the Moon be in Aries, it does presignificate rain
and tempest; in Taurus, storms; in Gemini, pestilence; in Cancer, dryness; in
Leo, burning heat; in Virgo, showers often, with untimely birth of children; in
Libra, great dryness; in Scorpio, plagues; in Sagittarius or Capricorn, rain
and tempest; in Aquarius, drought and sickness; in Pisces, rain the ensuing
year: But these Stadius says be not known to him for truths: for he holds
them more substantial that be taken, Exvarijs commixtionum causis. The 3 day
the Eagle sets Cosmicall, the South-west and bywest winds blowing with
great heat. Carda. says, it raises the Etesian winds, which with Ptol. do
continue 21 days: the 8 Regulus rises Cosmicall, raising North-east, and
by-north winds: the 13 day ye great Dog rises Heliacall, which limits the
beginning of the Grecian year, and of this rising be diverse observations: if
then the heaven be cloudy and dark, it signifies a heavy time with plagues,
etc. but being fair and clear, it is good. Also the 13 of August, the
Dolphine sets Cosmicall, bringing rain, and beginning Autumn, according to
Ptol. The 24 is S. Bartholomewes day, if the wind change not the following
night, the vulgar hold it good. Stadius recounts tempests, with hail, etc. to
come from the West, and North-west part, in the end of August, which often do
hurt.

The Abstract.
Reap Wheat and Rye, sow Winter herbs in the new Moon: stir land for
Wheat and Rye, and about the end of the Month down with Oats, or before,
according to the goodness of your soil. Look more in July.

September.
THe first day of this month is Critical, if it do not rain then, the rest
of Autumn is like to be dry: the 12 day Arcturus rises Cosmicall, rain: and
with Ptol. after two days Swallows leave to be seen. The 13 day is
Equinoctial, winds from West, North-west: the 17 Lucida Coronae rises
Cosmicall, Ptol. winds turn, troubling the seas with winterly weather. So
many days old the Moon is on Michaelmas day, so many floods will happen that
Winter.

The Abstract.
Cut down your Lent-tilling, gather the fruits of your trees, converting them
to use, as Crabbes for Veriuice, etc. About the midst of the Month sow wheat
and Rye in cold and strong land, sow winter parsneps, and Carrots, get hyues,
etc.

October.
THe 15 day the Dragons Tail sets vespertine, after this day we must
expect no more warmenesse: and therefore the Germans call it den Galen Summer.
The 21 the East winds blow: the 26 the left foot of Orion sets with the 12
degree of Scorpio: causing often great rain: if leaves now hang upon the
trees, some say it portends a cold winter, or many Caterpillars.

The Abstract.
Sow Wheat and Rye, the sooner the better, for fear of rain. The new Moon
makes a fit time to set and remove young trees, as the Plum, Pear, Apple, and
Bay Tree, to set Nuts, Akornes, etc. and after the full moon gather your
winter fruits.

November.
THe 4 or 5 day the Scorpions heart sets vespertine, which with Astrologers
is a Critical day. The 5 day the Dog sets bringing southernly wether: the
like judge of Orion, which sets about this time. The 8 day Succulae or
Hyades sets Cosmicall, frost or rain: the 10 the Pleiades set Cosmicall, if
then the heavens be cloudy it denunciates a wet winter: if day, a sharp
winter. Pliny says: Succularum and Pleiadarum occasum terra marique turbidum
esse. The 24 Arcturus sets Heliacall, causing often rain, with Cardanus.

The Abstract.
The time is apt to make Malt, to kill Bacons, to cut Ashes, to sow, if you
were too late the last month, to set Crabbe-tree stocks, to remove Trees, as
in the last month in the increasing of the Moon, but in the wane set beans,
pease, etc. Also now uncover the roots of your Apple trees, and so let them
rest till March.

December.
THe 6 of December is Dies Nicholai, of which Cardanus thus says: Proximi
septem Dies a. Bruma totidemque ante, raro ventis infestantur: they be called
Halcyon days. Stadius says, about the Brumall Solstitiall there does happen
Halcyon or most Tranquil weather: the 26 day the fair star Arcturus sets
vespertine, and then with Carda. the South winds blow.

Some say, if Christmas day come in the new Moon, it is a token of a good
year, and so much the better, by how much it is nearer the new Moon, the
contrary happens in the decrease.

The Abstract.
The time is good to fall timber, to uncover the roots of Apple Trees, to
fallow land for Barley, to set beans, pease, etc. the wether being not too
hard: and now Fowlers be busy with Limetwigges, and other engines to take
Fowls. Let a warm fire be thy bathe, the Kitchen thy Apothecaries shop, and
good hot meat thy diet, to which according to thy ability, inuit thy
neighbor. Therefore to conclude,

If thou be poor, and can not feast at all,
Go feast with such as shall to feasting call.
CHAP. XXXI. Predictions of every day more particularly.
TO give you judgment of the temperature of every particular day, there must
be great care had, and many things observed, as the quality of the sign, the
Lord of the lunation, the quality of the Absids, and of the Planets: for there
is no great change of wether unless Saturn, Jupiter, or Mars be aspected:
also the meeting of the planets, and mingling of their virtue with the Fixed
Stars, whose nature and magnitude are duly to be observed: the want, or not
observing of these, and many other which appertain to preiudications, cause
our ordinary and common Prognosticators so grossly to err, as I noted in my
Almanacke 1608: for as I said there, so must I here also: Qui non potest in
singulos dies de pruina niue grandine etc. Distinct praedicere, huic
praedicenti abundantiam aut penuriam frugum, nequaquam fides adhibenda est.
Over and beside what is said, the aspects of the Planets amongst themselves are
most heedfully to be regarded, even as in the ensuing Table, set in Latin for
the more breuity.

Enter this Table with the,, or (...) of the Planets, noting the weather in the
common Angle.

Over and besides these aspects you must likewise note the mansion that the
Moon is in, as in the 24 chapter, so shall you (conferring these things
together) produce more substantial preiudications, but indeed here is no place
amply to deliver such rules yt should be observed before (according to Art)
you can be able to give judgment of any one day, for I let pass all in
resepect of the unaptness of the volume.

CHAP. XXXII. Of the Golden number, Circle of the Sun, Dominicall letter, and
Epact, etc.
THe golden number is a Periodicall revolution of 19 of our civil years, in
which time the old Philosophers thought that all the lunations or aspects
betwixt the Sun and Moon, returned to the same place they were at 19 years
before, for in that space the Dragons head made a Periodicall revolution, but
this is not so, for in 19 years there is an Anticipation of an hour and a
half very near, wanting but 75 seconds, so that look what conjunction happened
this year in Aries at noone, shall fall 19 years hence, one hour and half
before: this Circle is called Decem-nouenalis Circulus, whose parts be called
the golden number: for that it was writ in golden characters in Tables of
silver, and so sent to Rome, or for that they be written in red or golden
leters in the Calendar, and is found thus.

Add to the year of our Lord 1. (for so much was the Prime when Christ was
borne) which divide by 19, the remainder is the Prime or Golden number.

Of the Epact.
THe Epact is nothing else but a number of 11 days, which the common solar
year does exceed the common Lunar year, ye one consisting of 365 days, the
other of 354 days, and therefore they add that excess unto ye Lunar year,
to coequal the^, for Epactae with ye Greeks from (...), which signifies
intercalare, or addere, by the addition of which excess in every four years,
there is gotten a number more then 30, which is greater then the Epact can be,
because from change to change there can be but 30 days: therefore 30 must be
taken from that excess, and the remainder is the Epact for the next year, as
1611 the Epact is 26 to which add 11, so have you 37, from which take 30, and
you have 7 the Epact 1612.

To get the Epact for ever, do therefore thus, multiply the Prime by 11,
parting the product by 30, so is the remainder the Epact; or as is said, add
11 to the Epact of this year, so have you ye Epact of the next, or see the age
of the Moon ye 11 Calends of April, for that is the number of the Epact.

But because I will ease you of calculation, see the ensuing Table, which
shows you in perpetual the Concordancy betwixt the Prime and ye Epact, so
that having one, you may find the other answering thereunto, and for your
further ease I have added the years of our Lord to it: having the year of our
Lord, under it in order you have the Prime and Epact, and when the years in
this Table be expired, begin them again, placing 1631 where 1612 is, etc. so
shall your Table be perpetual.

A Table to find the Golden number and Epact for ever.

Of the Circle of the Sun, and Dominicall letter, and to find them for ever.
THe Circle of the Sun, is nothing else but a revolution of 28 years, in
which time the Dominical letters make all their several changes, and it is
called the Circle of the Sun, not for that it shows any motion of the
Sun, but because by means thereof the letter Dominicall is always found as
we had a circle called Cyclus lunaris, by reason of the office it had, because
it was first invented ad monstrandas lunationes, so this is called the Solar
Circle, or rather in English, the Sunday Circle, because it comprehends all the
varieties and changes that the Sunday letter can have, by reason of Byssextile
or leap-yeare. In brief, this Circle is called the Circle of the Sun, because
it acquaints you with the Sunday letter, which is the day of the Sun.

To find the Circle of the Sun, either in the old or new Calendar do thus,
add to the year of our Lord proposed 9 (for our Savior was borne when ye
number was 9) which parted by 28 (as by ye number of years of the whole
circle) so shall the quotient show you yt number of reuolutions of ye said
circle, and the remainder the circle of the Sun.

Of the Dominicall letter.
THe Dominicall letter is always one of these seven letters ABCDEFG, and does
show ye Sunday letter, or day of the Sun all the year, unless it be in
Byssextile or leap-yeare, for then there be two Dominicall letters, whereof the
first of the two in this Table serves from the beginning of January, to Saint
Mathias eve, and the other to the years end, but for your more ease behold the
ensuing Table, where the Circle of the Sun and Sunday letter are placed under
the year of our Lord, and when the years of this Table be expired, set 1641
where 1612 is, so will your table be perpetual, if you proceed as before.

Note if it be leape-yeare the first of the two letters begins the year.

Also note the Epact changes always the first of March, and the Dominicall
letter and Prime, etc. the first of January.

Of the Roman indiction.
We have no great use of this circle in England, it is used of the Bishops of
Rome in ye instruments and writings of their Pronotations, imitating thereby
the old Romans, though theirs were to another purpose, as to bear account of
the payment of trybute: it is a number of 15 year, but for that it stands us
to little purpose in England, briefly find it thus.

Add to the year of our Lord 3, and divide the product by 15, so shall the
remainder be the number of the said indiction, and this indiction is counted
from September, not from March.

To get the Age, Change, Full, and Quarters of the Moon.
TO find the age of ye Moon you must have 3 things, as the Epact, the number
of months from March to your proposed month inclusiuely, and the day of the
month, these three sums had, add them altogether, so have you ye age of the
Moon, but if the sum exceed 30, substract 30, and that which you leave is
the age: this is meant if the month, wherein the question was made, have 31
days, for having less you must take away but 29 as often as you may.

Now if you know the age of the Moon any month this year, and would know how
old she shall be the same day the next year, you must add to her present age
11, so have you her age the same day of the month the ensuing year, and to
that age add 11, so have you her age the second year ensuing, and so
infinitely, remembering to reject 30 as before.

Likewise if you desire to know the age of the Moon in the year last past,
that is all found by addition, of 19 as before by 11, remembering the reiection
of 30.

To find the new, full, and quarters of the Moon.
MArtin Cortez teaches rules to find the day of conjunction, but they be not
so true as that of Gemma Frisius, which is thus: add to the Epact the number
of months from March to ye proposed month, including the said month, the
which taken from 30, the remainder shows the day of the change, but if the
sum of addition exceed 30, you were best to substract from 59, so is the
remainder the day of the change, in which point Gemma Frisius left us
destitute: the change had, the full Moon is found by the addition of 15 days,
and so by addition of 7 days and 9 hours, to the new or full Moon, you have
the first or last quarter.

To find the new or full Moon more exactly by my new Tables.
THese brief rules that the ancient Astronomers have taught, and the modern
obseruers corrected, howbeit they were singular in respect of the invention,
yet do they fail a day at least, especially when the Epact is above 26:
wherefore you shall have the day, hour and minute of the change and full Moon
set in my Calendar and truly verified till 1630, which by the ensuing rules
will serve perpetually, the use whereof is thus.

Consider if you seek the change or full Moon, for they have Primes both in
several columns upon ye left hand under this title Prim. Prim. ^ therefore
when you know what the Prime is for the proposed year, seek the same in one
of the rows of Primes descending, and note against what day of the Month it
stands,: for that is the day of the change or full Moon, according to the
Prime you took: then in the row under New or Full Moon is the hour and
minute of change, or opposition, noted with this letter A, or P, signifying
that it happened before or after noone, according to the letter there placed.

Example.
1612 the Prime is 17, and I desire to know what day and hour the change and
full moon shall fall on in August: First therefore for the New Moon, I find
the Prime 17, in the row upon the left hand under the title Prim., which stands
against the 16 day of the Month, therefore the change was the 16 day: then
against 17, under the title New Moon, is 11.6. A. which signifies that the
new Moon, which happened the 16 day, was at 11 of the clock, and 6 minutes
before Noone.

Now for the full Moon in August, I seek the Prime for that proposed year,
under the proper title of Prim., which you shall find to stand against the 31
day, and then under the title of Full Moon, is 3.49. A, whereby (as before)
you may conclude, that the Full Moon in August 1612, will be the 31 day, at 3
of the clock, and 49 minutes before noone.

And here note, against some Primes you shall find 16 or 17 hours, or more,
with this letter A or P, which signifies that the Aspect happened so many
hours before or after high Noone of the same day.

Now if you would know any of these Aspects after 1630, you must substract 1
hour and 30 minutes from the time of the happening of the Aspect, and when you
have done so 19 years, then substract 3 hours, and so forth, always
subtracting 1 hour and 30 minutes for every 19 years: hereby will those Tables
be made more true perpetually, then any that yet were ever extant.

CHAP. XXXIIII. To find what sign the Sun or Moon is in.
TO find the sign that the Moon is in, Joan, de Sacro Bosco says thus:
Multiply the age of the Moon by 4, parting the product by 10, so shall the
quotient show you ye number of signs that the Moon is distant from the Sun:
then the ramainder multiplied by 3, notes to you the degree of the sign that
the Moon is in: Therefore find the place of the Sun, as hereafter, and from
thence count the signs and degrees before found, and where it ends, is the
place of the Moon: but this rule is not precise, and besides, is tedious for
the vulgar.

To know what sign the Moon is in by my new Tables.
FOr this purpose there be so many Tables out, and they subject unto much
error, that if the Moon do work in these inferior bodies, as Pliny
affirms, lib. 2. chap. 99, or alter the humors thereof according to her place
in the Zodiac, as the learned teach, and experience confirms: then vain and
unnecessary be those Tables, that so lead the vulgar into such errors and
abuses: for either it is necessary that her true place be known, or needless
to be sought: if needless, what needs any observation at all? if necessary,
how do they beguile them that put trust therein? For the Sheep-heards Calendar,
General Prognostication, Computation, and such like books, suppose the Moon
never to her slow motion, but when she is in Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, which
is extremely false: for you shall perceive her stay: days in the other signs,
if you peruse my Tables, as in Aries, Taurus, or Gemini, etc. which their
Tables will not allow: which error is like that of Pliny, lib. 2. chap. 17,
saying, that ye Moon enters not twice in conjunction with the Sun, in any
other sign but Gemini, which is not so, as in the year 1609, and 1612, in
August and September, there be conjunctions in Virgo, as in April and May
1610 in Taurus. Also he says, there is never any conjunction of the Sun and
Moon in Sagittarius, the contrary is 1613, in December, and 1614 in November:
Therefore to find what sign the Moon precisely is in every day in the year,
till 1630, do thus; Get ye Prime as before, and then resort unto your Calendar,
finding the Month, and the Prime in the head of the Table for that month: Now
descending down ye Column, which is under your Prime, until you come against
the day of the month, there shall you find against the said day of the
moves, the true sign that the Moon is in that day.

Example.
1612 the Prime is 17, and I desire to know what sign the Moon is in the 7
day of May; I therefore descend the Column under 17, until I come against the
7 day, which stands upon the left hand the Table, there I find. I conclude the
Moon is then in Sagittarius: then the 8 day in, Capricorn: but the
Computation, and the rest of the books say, the 8 day in Sagittarius, which is
false. Lastly, over each of my Tables for the Moon, is placed the nature of
the sign she is in.

To know what sign the Sun is in.
The Degree and Sign that the Sun is in, stands in the last column in the
former Table, for the place of the Moon upon the right hand, against the day
of the month, and under this Title place.

CHAP. XXXV. Of the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and to know when they
shall happen, and the quantity of obscuration.
THe Eclipse of the Sun is nothing else but the conueying of the Moon (which
is a dark body) betwixt our sight and the Sun, insomuch that the Sun
loses no light, but only we are deprived of the same, in respect of the
interposition of the Moon; and this never happens but when the Sun and
Moon be in a visible conjunction: for you have your mean, true and visible
conjunction, the which true and visible conjunction always happen together
when the Sun and Moon have no paralax, which is when they be in conjunction
in the 90 degree: s^^ that the further the true conjunction is from the 90
degree, the greater is the difference of these two conjunctions: so that you
can have no eclipse of the Sun, but when the visible conjunction is near the
Nodes.

Now all eclipses of the Sun beeither total without duration, which
happens when the Moon has no apparent latitude at the time of ye visible
conjunction, or partial, which duration, may happen three manner of ways:
First, when the diameter is only darkened as when the apparent latitude of ye
Moon is equal to her apparent semidiameter. Secondly, when there is more then
his semidiameter darkened, as when the Moons apparent latitude is less then
her apparent semidiameter: And lastly, when there is less then the Suns
diameter darkened, as when the apparent latitude of the Moon is greater then
her apparent semidiameter; and you shall know if the apparent latitude of the
Moon exceed 34 minutes, 51 seconds, the Sun cannot be any thing eclipsed,
and the greatest eclipse the Sun can suffer, is when he is in the Auge of his
Eccentricke, and in his greatest eccentricity, and the Moon in her opposite
Auge, whereby such places that be sytuate within the compass of the Moons
shadow, may loose the whele light of the Sun, the diameter whereof does
contain 280 of our English miles, or thereabouts. Further it may so fall out,
that you shall see the whole body of the Moon within the compass of the
Sun, the Sun seeming to loose his light in the very midst, and about the
same will appear a narrow shining circle, of three quarters of an inch in
breadth, which happens when the Moon is in her Auge, and the Sun in his
least eccentricity, and in oppost Auge: but this discourse is not fit for this
volume, therefore to the matter.

To find the Eclipse of the Sun.
You must know that the body of the Sun is supposed to be divided into 12
Digits, and that he is never eclipsed but at the new Moon: therefore find
the new Moon, as you be taught before, and then in the row upon your left
hand, under the title Digits, see if there stand any figure against the same,
for then may you conclude the Sun to be Eclipsed, the same hour that ye new
Moon happens, and that there be so many parts of his body darkened, as the
figures vuder Digits express.

Example.
1612. In May I find the new Moon to happen the 20 day, at 5 of the clock,
and 43 min. before Noone: then against the same, under Digits, stands 8/12,
therefore I conclude that the Sun shall be eclips^^ at that hour, 8 parts and
a half, and if there ^ad stood such a mark as this (^) he had been eclipsed,
though not visible in our Horizon.

After the same order may you find what e^^ipses happen any day of any month
for any year to come, or thus: seek under the title of Digits what figures
stand there, and what Primes answer thereunto, then find the said Primes in
the little Table before, and over the head thereof is the year of our Lord God.

Of the Eclypses of the Moon.
To speak properly of an Eclypse, it is an obscuration of light in the Sun,
and a defection of the Moon: for the Moon is a dark and gross body, having
no light but such that thee receineth of the Sun, whereby she is never
eclipsed, but at such time that the earth is betwixt the Sun and her, which
chances thee being at the full diametricall opposite to the Sun, and some
what near to the head or tail of the Dragon: But these Eclipses of the Moon
for diverse causes, be not always after one manner, as first by reason of her
unequal latitude, which sometime is nothing at all, whereby the eclipse is
greater in magnitude, and longer in duration. Another time her latitude is so
great, that thee falls but a little within the shadow of ye earth, loosing
but a little light: and sometime she comes not in the shadow of the earth,
and then is not eclipsed: for it is general, that when the Moons latitude, at
a true Opposition, is lesser then the semidiameter of the shadow, and the
Moons body both, being set together, that the Moon will be eclipsed, and the
more those semidiameters exceed the latitude, the greater is the Eclipse.

Again, these Eclipses differ in respect of the unequal thickness of the
shadow of the earth: for the body of the Sun (as is said) is greater then the
body of the Earth: and therefore the shadow cannot be Cylindricall, or
Calathoidall, but only Conicall, rising beyond the earth, and ending in a
point: but for all these and many other causes of the variety of lunar
Eclipses, yet we may reduce them for breuities sake, into two principal heads,
as Total and Partile: the Total is two-sold, as either without continuance of
time, loofing all her light but for an instant, because the semidiameter of the
earth is as great as the Moons latitude, and her semidiameter: or total with
continuance, loosing all her light for a certain space, because the
semidiameter of the shadow of the earth, in the place of the Eclipse, exceeds
the latitude of the Moon, and her bodily somidiameter.

The Partile Eclipse of ye Moon is when part if the body of the Moon is
darkened, whereof there be 3 sorts: first when half her diameter is darkened,
happening when the latitude of the Moon is equal to the semidiameter of the
earths shadow: next when less then the semidiameter is darkened, happening
when her latitude is more then the semidiameter of ye earths shadow. Thirdly,
when more then the Moons semidiameter is obscured, which comes to pass when
the latitude of the Moon is less then the semidiameter of the earths shadow.

Of the parts of the Moon Eclipsed.
Like as the body of the Sun, so also the body of ye Moon is imagined to be
divided into 12 parts, because their diameters appear as a foot long, so that
we say they be eclipsed so many digits or fingers, but for the Moon by reason
of the thickness of the shadow of the earth, she may be eclipsed 23 Digits:
but I should prove ouer-tedious amply to discourse of these matters: therefore
find out her eclipse thus:

To find the Moons Eclipse.
Find (as before) at what hour, and what day of the month any full Moon
happens, and there find the eclipse of the moon, as you did that of the
Sun, remembering always to seek the moons eclipse under the Title Full
Moon, and her Eclipse, and the Digits, or parts of her body eclipsed in the
row upon the right hand, under Digits, remembering what is said of the Sun.
This is casie.

The use of the former Table.
IF you would know at what hour the day break, the Sun rise and set, and
how long the days and nights be, and when twilight ends, do thus:

In the first row upon your left hand, find your month, and in ye next row
rightwards the day of the month, which are placed against the month three
times, thus: 1, 10, 20, and when you want the just day, take the nearest, for
it will serve precise enough: The day of the month thus found, proceed
rightward against the said day, so shall you see the hour and minute of all
the foresaid under their proper Titles, and against the said day of the month.
As the 20 day of August the day breaks at three of the clock and 8 minutes,
the Sun rises at 5 and 18 minutes, the length of the day is 13 hours, and
23 minutes, and so proceed forth.

To find the hour of the day.
MVltiply the sign of the Suns Altitude (taken instrumentally) by the sign
of the semidiurnall Arc, dividing the product by the sign of the Suns
Meridian altitude, reserving then the quotient, seek the arc answering to the
same, as you be taught in the'seuenth book of my Staff, called Trigonometria,
the which arc convert into hours, as you be also taught in the said seventh
book: so have you the number of hours from Sun rising, if your observations
were before noone, or the distance from Sun set, if they were in the afternoon.

Otherwise.
In the ensuing Scheme find the degree that the Sun is in, in the lowerend
thereof, and in the side B A find the altitude of the Sun, then note where the
line passing by the degree of the Sun parallel to B A, intersects with the
line running from the altitude of the Sun, and parallel to D A, or C B: for
the houre-line passing by that intersection is the hour of the day.

Example.
The 21 of April 1612 the Sun is in the 10 degree of 8, and 30 degrees high,
the paralels issuing from which two places, intersect at E, and the houre-line
passing by is marked with 8, and 4, so that if your observations were before
noone, it had been 8, if after noone 4 of the clock.

By this means the degree the Sun is in, and the hour of the day given, you
may find his altitude the same hour, and contrary: also hereby you may find
the rising and setting of the Sun, etc. and many other pretty conclusions which
the ingenious will soon know, and I for breuities take omit.

CAAP. XXXVII. To know how long the Moon shines, when she rises and sets,
with the cause of her less or greater light.
THe Moon has no light but what she receives of the Sun, being a dark
and gross body, as is well manifested in the time of her eclipse, and though
the vulgar think she is now partly lightened, and now total, the imagination
is mere false, for she always retains one and the self same quantity of
light at her quarters and other aspects, as at the full: for she is a round
Globe, and that part of the globious body that beholds the Sun is always
lightened: so that when she is near the Sun, the lightened half is auerted
and turned from us respectively to the Sun because she comes more and more
under the Sun, receiving thereby light upon her uppermost part, which
beholds the Sun, and therefore the further she is from the Sun, the
greater is her light, and to know how long she shines, do thus:

All the time of her increase multiply her age by 4, but in the decrease, or
after the full, see what her age wants of 30, the which also multiply by 4,
and make partition by 5, the quotient shows the number of hours she shines
after Sunset, or before his rising. Lastly, the remaineder multiplied by 12
shows the minutes to be added: for always whilst she does increase, she
follows the Sun, and shines after Sunset, her lightened part looking into
the West: but decreasing she goes before the Sun, and shines before his
rising, her lightened part looking into the East.

To know when the Moon rises and sets.
This rule, in respect of the manifold motions of the Moon, but chiefly in
respect of her latitude, is not always so precise, they may serve for a shift,
and sometime is precise.

Note therefore the length of her shining, as before, and also note if it be in
the increase or decrease of the Moon, and then for either work thus:

All the increase to the hour of Sun rising, add the quantity of her shining,
so have you her rising: the same quantity add to the time of Sunsetting, so
also have you her setting.

But after the full, take the quantity of her shining from ye Sun rising, and
you have her rising: the same also taken from Sunsetting, shows the time of
her setting, and if substraction cannot be made, borrow 12.

But for such that cannot find the quantity of her shining Arithmeticall, let
them enter the ensuing Table with her age, finding the same in one of the rows
descending, or ascending, in the first column upon the left hand, answering to
which in the next column under the title, The Moons coming to South, shall
you find the hour and minute of her shining: then for her rising and setting,
work as before.

hours and minutes placed by the name of each Haven unto the hour of the
Moons coming to the South: as the Moon being three dates old, comes to the
South at two of the clock, and 24 minutes: then if you desire the high water
at Redban, you must add 45 minutes more, so have you 3 of the clock and 9
minutes.

For the high water at Redban or Aberden add 45 minutes, for Dundee, S.
Andrews, Silly, 2 hours 15 minutes: for Frith, Leith, Dunbar, 4 hours, 30
minutes: For Flamot 5 hours 15 minutes: for Foy, Lyn, Humber, Waymouth,
Dertmouth, Plymouth, 6 hours: For Milford, Bridgewater, 7 hours 30 minutes:
For Portland, Peterport, 8 hours 15 minutes: For Orkenpoole, Orwell, 9 hours,
Diep, Lux, Lenoys, 9 hours, 45 min. For Bolein, Dover, Harwich, Yarmouth, 10
hours 30 minutes: For Callice, Rye, and Winchelsy, 11 hours, 15 minutes.

To know at what time the Moon will be full South any day in the year.
Seek her Age in the third Column, answering to which in the second column
is the hour of her coming to the South, and note all the increase she
comes to the South after Noone, that is, until she be 15 days old, and all
the decrease she comes to the South in the morning.

To know what of the clock it is in the night by the Moon.
Look upon any Sun-dyall, and see what of clock it is by the shadow of the
Moon (as you do by the Sun) noting how much it wants or is past 12 of the
clacke: for so much it wants or is past the hour of her coming to the South
that day, which hour you be taught in the last note to find.

Example.
Upon a certain day I looked in a Sunne-dyall and found the shadow of the
Moon to point at 10 of the clock, which wanted two hours of 12, the same day
I also found her age 9 days, and thereby her coming to the South was at 7
hours and 12 minutes, therefore it wanted 2 hours of the same: so that it
must be 5 of the clock and 12 minutes past: or if the same day the shadow had
been at 2 after noone, it had been 2 hours past 7, and 12 minutes, to wit, 9
and 12 minutes: So of the rest.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Astronomicall Elections for physic and Surgery, depending
upon the place, and course of the Moon.
IF thy body be filled with naughty and superfluous humors, then were it
connenient for thee to draw blood, so the heavens consent thereunto, and thy
age agree therewith; which being not circumspectly weighed, it may be most
dangerous to the Patient (of which no understanding man is ignorant) but when
necessity urges, as for the Pestilence, Plurisie, Phrenzy, etc. then, though
the Heavens deny, yet a vein is spcedily to be opened, ad aegri salutem. This
considered of medicines some be purgative, some comfortiue and others in the
mean betwixt both. Medicines purgative be either Soluendo or Leniendo: In the
first the Moon must be in Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces. For the other the moon
must be taken when she works more in moistness then dryness, being in a or
* with Mars; and you must take beed in the hour of giving the medicine lest
the Moon have any aspect with Saturn: for he congeales the humors, making the
medicine work little: likewise let her be free from any aspect with Jupiter:
for he is the giver of life, the helper and comforter of the virtues: so that
the medicine can but weakly expel the humors, making the body affected with an
evil quality. Further, in all purgative medicines observe the ensuing Rules.

The in S in or with, Purge choler not co^bust, With elelectuaries. The in S in
or with, Purge phlegm. With elelectuaries. The in S in or with, Purge the
Melancholy. With elelectuaries. The in in or with, Purge yt choleric non vsta
With Potions. The in in or with, Purge the Plegmatick With Potions. The in in
or with, Purge the melancholy. With Potions. The in in or with, Purge ye
choleric non vsta, With Pills. The in in or with, Purge the Phlegmatic. With
Pills. The in in or with, Purge the Melancholy. With Pills. The in or in or with,
Purge yt choleric vt supra with any kind of medicine. The in or in or with,
Purge the Phlegmatic. with any kind of medicine. The in or in or with, Purge
the Melancholy. with any kind of medicine.
But let not the Moon be in any of the signs that chaw the Cud, as,,, for
then the medicine will stay but a little with the patient, causing him to
vomit, unless you intend to purge by vomiting. Also in purging the melancholy
let not Saturn have domunon, nor Jupiter in purging the sanguine, or the
liner; nor Mars the choleric, bitter sweats, etc. nor Luna the head, nor
Mercury in purging the lungs.

How the virtues be corroborated.
The virtues be either Vital, Animal, or Natural; the Vital virtues remain
in the heart, the Animal in the brain, and the Natural in the liver; the
Vital virtues are governed of Sol and Jupiter, the Animal of Luna, Mercury and
Venus, and the Natural of Jove and Venus.

Other virtues be also governed of the planets, as the virtue Attactiue is
governed of Sol, the Disgestiue of Jove, the Retentiue of Saturn, and the
Expulsive of Luna.

Also the signs thus govern the virtues, Aries and Sagitarius rules the
Atractiue, Gemini and Libra the Disgestiue, Taurus and Virgo the Retentiue, and
Cancer and Pisces the Expulsive.

Also the virtues be ruled by the planess thus: Sol the wellspring of the
virtues Vital, Luna of the virtues Animal, Saturn of the Receptiue, Jupiter
of the Augmentatiue, Mars of the Attractiue, Venus of the Appetitiue, and
Mercury of the Imaginatiue: Therefore when you would fortify any of these
virtues, fortify the planet signifying the same, and it is done.

Rules for drawing of blood.
In letting of blood you must know what persons are fit to bleed, and what not;
and if they be fit, how it is with the Patient inwardly, for his complexion

For Complexion.
For the Phlegmatic let the Moon be in Aries or Sagittarius when you draw
blood. For the Melancholy in Libra or Aquarius. For the Choleric in Cancer or

CHAP. XXXIX. Of the moveable Feasts, and diversities of Easter, with the
reason of our difference and the Romans.
Having spoken of the changes of the Moon, etc. It follows to speak of the
moveable Feasts, because they depend thereon, and have no fixed place in the
Calendar, being six in number, to wit, Septuagesima, Quadragesima, Easter,
Rogation Sunday, Ascension, and Whitsunday.

Septuagesima is so called of 70, as it were containing 70 days, which the
Church does observe in remembrance of the 70 years that the children of
Israel were under the Babylonicall servitude, and is always three Sundays
before Quadragesima.

Quadragesima is simply said of 40, as containing 40 days, which the Church
recounts in remembrance of the 40 days that Moses fasted, when he received the
Laws of our Lord, Elias fasted so many days, and so many days fasted Christ
before the tempter came; and because the actions of Christ should be
instructions to us, therefore we should endeavor to fast so many days.

Easter is the principal of all other Feasts and so ordained by God at first,
and at this day there be three sorts, that is, Pascha Hebraeorum, the Jews
Easter, Pascha Verum, our Easter, and Pascha Nouum, the Romans Easter.

The Jews Easter was commanded to be kept the 14 day of the first month,
called Abib, which day at Even was the Lords Passover, and the 15 day should be
the holy Convocation, as you may see, Exodus chap. 12. verse 18. Leuit. 23.5.
Deuteronomy. 16.1. Numb. 28.16. Esdras. 7.10. And this 15 day is taken for the first
day after the first full Moon, happening after the Spring Equinoctial: which
institution the Jews altered, holding a superstitious opinion of days, and
thereby would not keep their Easter upon a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday,
breaking thereby the commandedament of God like stiff-necked people, as in the
2 book of the Kings. chap. 23. v. 22.

Our Easter was ordained 322 years after the Incarnation: for Constantinus
Magnus noting the errors risen amongst the congregation of the Christians and
the many contentions that continually rose after the Apostles time about the
celebration of Easter, assembled from all Nations; 18 Bishops and other
learned, as well Greeks as Latins and Egyptians, such that could withal well
determine of the motions of ye celestial bodies: Amongst whom was Eusebius,
Bishop of Caesaria chief, being an excellent Mathematitian, and he kept them
there two years upon his own cost and charges, and so 323 after the
Incarnation there was a new Decemnouall, or Golden Number instituted, differing
from that the Romans then used, which made it the longer before they would
consent unto it: for by this new Circle Easter should be celebrated upon the
Sunday next following the first fuil Moon that should happen after the
entrance of the Sun into Aries, and this new institution continued not
passing seven years after the Nicene Council: for in 330 there fell
differences betwixt the Romans and the Greeks about the same, which continued
neers 200 years: and then in the time of Iustinianus the Emperor, Dionysius
Abbas, a worthy Roman, Anno 527, began to draw Paschall Tables, and Rules
Ecclesiastical, according as it was ordained at the former Council, which he
finished Anno 532, and then at a Counceil at Calcedon it was established, that
whosoever held any other Easter then that after the statutes of Rome, should
ber counted an heretic, and therefore till 1582, no man durst presume to
alter the Easter, though they saw the Equinoctium still fly backwards from the
21 of March, insomuch that it is now about the 11, day, by reason of which
anticipation sometimes there happens two full Moons before we can keep our
Easter, which was a cause the Romans altered their Calendar, and thereby is
there 28 days difference sometimes betwixt us and them, as in Anno 1557, 60,
71, 84. and 87, also there may happen 35 days, as in Anno 1565, 68, 76, 79, in
all which years there happens two full moons betwixt our Easter, and the
Spring Equinoctial, so did it 1595, and far more late, as 1603, and so shall
it 1622, the which inconvenience the Romans finding, reformed their Paschall
Tables, whereby they produce Easter always the Sunday following the first full
moon, according to the foresaid first general Council held at Nice in Pontus
322 years after the Incarnation: But now whether it be best for us to alter
our Tables and Calendar according to that Council, I will not presume to
argue: if some say all Christians used this we do 1055 years, I answer, the
Nicene Council made no respect of the small want that the day in cucry Leap
year wanted of 24 hours, being but 47 minutes, 12 seconds, as in the 21
Chapter: but since there is passed 1289 years this present year 1611. whereby
the Equinoctial is gone before the 21 of March (as it was then observed) 10
days, and this is the cause of the difference betwixt us and the Romans,
whereby the Astronomers are forced in their Registers to distinguish thus
betwixt us and them, Annus Nouus and Vetus, and so of the Calendar, and of
Easter, and the other moveable feasts, as before, but this volume is too short
for an ample discourse.

Now Easter has diverse names, according unto the diversity of Nations, with
the Hebrews it is called Pascha, with the Greeks, Basis, and with the Latins
Transitus, with us Easter.

Rogation Sunday is so called, because nos rogat Ecclesia, the Church commanded
us to contiune fasting, processions, and prayers as well against the bodily
Woolues, such as late were in ^^tance, as also against the spiritual Woolues.

Pentecoste is so called from (...), which is Quinquagesimus, because there be
50 days betwixt Easter and Whitsunday inclustuely, and this time the Church
does observe in remembrance of the Law given unto Moses in the burning mount,
as also in memorial of the Holy Ghost, that appeared to the Apostles like
cloven tongues as you may read Acts 2.1.

And these be called moveable Feasts for that they have not any fixed place in
the Calendar, by reason of the celebration of Easter, whereupon the finding of
all the rest depend.

CHAP. XL. To find all the moveable Feasts for cuer according to our English
Calendar.
ENter this Table seeking the Golden Number in the first row descending upon
the left hand, which having found, proceed directly unto the right hand, until
you comme under the Dominicall letter for the proposed year: so shall the
number in the common angle show you the number of we^eks of Interuallum Minus,
and the number just over the Dominical Letter, are odd days to be added,
which is the distance of weeks and days betwixt the birth of our Lord, and
Quinquagesima, or Esto mihi, which is Shroue-sunday.

1613. The Golden number is 18, and the Dominicall letter is C, finding
therefore 18, in the fist row under Prime, and then proceeding rightwards,
until I come under C, I find seven weeks, and over C 2 I conclude
Interuallum minus, for from Christmas to Shroue-sunday is seven weeks and two
days.

This Interuallum minus being found, find the same in the ensuing Table, upon

One thing note in the use of this Table, that ye Leap-yeare has two Letters,
as GF, BA, DC, FE, AG, CB, or ED, the first of these always beginning the
year, as in Chap. 30. but you must enter this Table with the later.

To find the Moveable Feasts otherwise.
Seek the change of the Moon in February, for that year, as in Chap. 31. the
next Tuesday after is Shroue-tuesday, but if the change be upon Tuesday, then
the next Tuesday following is Shroue-tuesday, then the next Sunday is the first
Sunday in Lent, six Sundays after is Easter day, to which add 5 weeks, so
have you Rogation Sunday, then is it four days more to Ascension day, from
which proceed forwards 10 days for Whitsunday, the next Sunday after is
Trinity Sunday, and the next Thursday, Corpus Christi day.

CHAP. XLI. To find the Moveable feasts according to the Roman Church.
THe Romans say they do observe their Easter and yt moveable feasts both
according to Gods commandment, and according to the Edict in the Council of
Trent: the truth thereof I leave to the learned, and here set down how to
find it for Merchants and others that have to do beyond the seas.

To have their Easter, you must first find the Epact, (for they have rejected
the Golden Number in that behalf) and yet does their Epact often miss a day,
sometimes two, and seldom hit truly the day of the new Moon, even as with us
it does.

But to find the first find the Golden Number in the ensuing Table, under it is
the Epact.

An. Do. 1614 1615 1616 1617 1618 1619 1620 1621 1622 1623 An. Do. 1624 1625
1626 1627 1628 1629 1630 1612 1613 Prime 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Prime 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 18 Epact 19 1 12 23 4 15 26 7 18 29 Epact 10 21 2 23 24 5 26 27 8

And this is a perfect agreement of the Prime and Epact in the new Roman
Calendar, and is true until 1700. And for your more ease I have added the
year of our Lord God unto 1630, so yt knowing what year of our Lord it is,
you have under it both the Prime and Epact, and when these years of our Lord
God be expired, then set 1631 where 1612 is, and 1632 where 1613 is, and so
proceed, whereby you make your Table serve so long as the Epact and Prime
agree which is until 1700 be past: or take 10 from our Epact found, Chap. 30.
so have you the Roman Epact till 1700, after which time deduct 11 for the
correption of the years.

Now to find the moveable feasts according to the Romans, do thus: First,
find the Epact, as before, and then the Dominicall Letter for the Tabula
Paschatis noua Reformata.

CHAP. XLII. Of the Ember and Fasting-daies, as also of the times of Marriage.
THere be four times in the year called Anni quatuor tempora, which the
Church has appointed for Ieiuniall or fasting dayee, every of which times
contains three days, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday: two of which fasts
depends on days fixed, the other upon days moveable: First, we fast in the
Spring to the end as all things then flourish, so may also the works of men:
in Summer, that we may be in charity: in Autumn, that we may bring forth the
fruits of good works: and in winter, that as the leaves fall from the trees,
and small hearhes dye, so vice may be killed in us, and superfluities fall from
us: Or we rast to temperate and moderate the humor predominating that quarter,
as Choler in Summer, etc. as in Chap. 27. the which fasting days be The
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Quadragesima, The Wednesday, Friday and
Saturday after Whitsunday, The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Holy
Cross. The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Saint Lucies day.


But if Holy Cross, or S. Lucies day fall upon a Wednesday, then take the
Wednesday following: as for other fasting days, they be noted in the Calendar.
And the cause wherefore the Romans and we observe no fasting day, betwixt the
Resurrection and Ascension day is (as I take it) grounded upon this Text: Can
the children of the Marriage Chamber fast whilst the Bridegroom is with them,
etc. Mark. 2.19.

Times prohibited from Marriage.
from after Adue^tsunday after Septuagesima 3 days before the Ascension. till
8 days after the Epiphany. from after Adue^tsunday after Septuagesima 3 days
before the Ascension. till 8 do. after Easter Trinity Sunday.
CHAP. XLII. Of Weights and Measures used in England.

every penny weight 24 grains, whereby a Mark weight is 80 ounces, as in the
ensuing Table.

By the weight Auerdupois is weighed all kind of Grocery, all physical
drugges, all gross wares, as Rosin, wax, pitch tar, tallow, hemp, flax,
etc. and all Iron, steel, lead, tin, copper, alome, copporas, etc. and
though the pound of this weight be greater then the pound Troy, yet is the
ounce less, because the pound Troy has but 12 ounces; and the pound
Auerdupois 16 ounces, as in ye Table ensuing: and you must note that the
Auerdupois pound is divided into Grains, Scruples, Dragmes, and so to ounces
every one having a proper Character to express the same, as is set after the
Table.

CHAP. XLV. To know how to reckon how much your daily expenses comes unto in
the whole year very readily without a Table, or Calculation.
TO avoid all Tables, and to give you a ready rule to bear in memory, do thus:
Suppose you spent 6 pence the day, and would know what it amounts unto in the
year, which to do, say thus: six pence the day, is six pounds, six half
pounds, and six groates, which set together, makes 9 pounds two shillings.
Again 7 pence the day is 7 pounds, 7 half pounds, and 7 groates in ye year,
which set together, makes 10 pounds 12 shillings, and four pence: The like of
any other.

How Money is numbered in England.
The greatest piece of English silver now coined ordinarily at ye Tower is
called 12 d. or a shilling, and that is divided into two parts, which be called
6 pence, or testons, and that is subdivided into two other parts, called 3
pence, being one fourth part of the shilling. Again, the 12 pence is divided
into 6 parts, every of which part is called 2 pence The shilling is divided
into 12 parts called pence, into 24 parts called half pence, and into 48 parts
called farthings: we have now a piece of silver stamped, which is the of a
shilling, called 9 pence, and the half of that called 4 pence half penny,
three of which make a Scottish mark, which is 13 pence half penny sterling:
out of these small pieces there is made other sums, that have proper and
peculiar denominations, as Crowns, Nobles, and Marks, and their halfes, a
Crown is 5 shillings, a Noble 6 shillings 8 pence, a mark 13 shillings 4
pence, or two Nobles: four Nobles is 26 shillings 8 pence: five Nobles is 33
shillings 4 pence: seven Nobles is 2 pounds 6 shillings 8 pence: 14 Nobles is 4
pounds, 13 shillings 4 pence, and 20 Nobles is 6 pounds 13 shillings 4 pence.
Again, four Marks is 2 pound 13 shillings 4 pence: five Marks is 3 pound 6
shillings 8 pence: 20 Marks 13 pound 6 shillings 8 pence: 40 Marks is 26
pound 13 shillings 8 pence: And an hundred Marks is 66 pound 13 shillings, 4
pence.

Of the Dimensions of England, and other parts of the World, according to other
Authors.
BRITAIN, as M. Pitheas, and Isidorus report, is in compass, 3825. miles,
which is false, but Pliny says, when this Dimension was taken, the Romans had
knowledge but to the Forest called Caledonia. Agrippa says, it is in lenghth,
800. miles, and in breadth, 300. miles, and that Ireland is as broad, but not so
long by 200. miles. Some of our own Countrymen have published the compass of
England to be 4340 miles, and that ye length from Barwicke to Portsmouth, is
320 miles, and the breadth in the brodest place, which is from Dover (or rather
from Sandwich) 300. miles but it is not so much, as you may gather by my
dimensions before, which be truly set down.

Of Europe.
Pliny, Lib. 6. Chap. 31. says, that Europe is in length 3748. miles, and that
the breadth at the broadest is 250. miles. Agrippa would have it 910 from the
bounds of Cyrene, ending at the Garamantes: for so far to them was known and
discovered.

Of Asia.
Pliny also says, that Asia is in length, 63750 miles, and in breadth from the
Ethiopian Sea, to Alexandria, situate upon Nilus, 1875. and that Europe is
scarce half so big as Asia.

Also, that Europe is twice as much as Africa, and a sixth part over: so that
by Plinies Computation, in reducing all these parts together, Europe is a third
part of the Earth, and an eighth portion over, and Asia a fourth part, and one
14 portion, and Africa a fifth part, with an overplus of a 16 portion.

But the ignorance of these Authors is herein to be excused, in respect it is
not so now: For since their time our Travelers have found out, as it were, a
new world, of which they were ignorant of, imagining no such thing, to wit,
America, and Magellana, so that as they before divided the world into three
parts, now be there flue such parts: but Pliny (like the Author of such
another great English volume) was forward to write much upon reports, and that
of the meanest, as Hunters, Fowlers, Sheepheards, etc. And therefore since has
been called by some, Rusticus Mendax. But as his works he learned (though
much matter impertinent, and erroneous) so is he in many things excuseable. As
for Europe, it now consists of above 28. Kingdoms, beside the Roman Empire.
In length it contains from the Cape of Portingale to the river Taneus 3800.
miles, and in breadth, from the Archipellago to the Frise Ocean, 1200. miles,
and is wasted upon the western and Northern part, partly by the Ocean, and
partly by the Balthean Seas: as for the other four parts of the world, I
cannot here stand further to speak of them.

CHAP. XLVI. Of the difference of Gold in finenesse, and the valuation of
several pieces of Gold, with other necessary Tables.
What is meant by Troy, or Auerdupois weight, is declared before, and what is
meant by the ounce, etc. is expressed likewise in Tables for that purpose: It
rests therefore to give you a Table of the finenesse of gold, because there
is some gold better then other, and also to deliver the valuation of certain
pieces of Gold.

But here you must note, that it is intended in this Table, a penny weight of
Goldsmiths weight, which is made by the weight of 24 barley corns, dried, and
taken out of the midst of the ear, 20 of which peny-weights make an ounce,
and 12. ounces a pound Troy, as before.

Of which weight the ensuing pieces of Gold, weigh, as follows.

of gold, according to the proclamation dated the 23 of November in the 9 year
of his Majesty's reign of great Britain, France and Ireland, 1611.

THe circumstance of this Proclamation is to restrain the great gain that is
made by the exportation of our gold, as being like wise a consequent of the
disproportion between ye price of his Majesty's coins abroad, and here within
his Kingdom. For which cause, and others, too long to recite, it is
Authorized, ye all several pieces of Gold hereafter mentioned, to be current
within this realm respectively hereafter, at the values following.

The piece of gold called the Unite. 22 s^. Double crown 11 s^. Britain. crown.
5 s^. 6. d. Thistle crown. 4 s^. 4 d. ob. q Half crown. 2 s^. 9 d. The coin
of gold of Scotland, called the 6 l. piece. 11 s^.


Our gold called the Rose roial 33. s^. Spur roial 16. s^. 6 d Angel 11. s^.
These be not current in Scotland.


All other pieces of gold of his Majesty's progenitors, and now current
proportional to bears the like increase as follows.

Every piece of gold formerly current for 30 shillings, to be 33 shillings. For
^0 s^. to be 22 s^. For 15 s^. to be 16 s^. 6 d. For 10 s^. to be 11 s^. For 5
s^. to be 5. s^. 6 d. For 2 s^. 6 d. to be 2 s^. 9 d..

But if the gold shall be too light, according to ye abateme^ts following, the^
any subject may refuse it.

Every piece of gold current for 30 s, must not want above 4 gr. di. Current
for 20 s. not to want above 3. gr. Current for 15 s. not to want above 2. gr.
Current for 10 s. not to want above 2 gr. di. Current for 5 s. not to want
above 1. gr. Current for 2. s. 6 d. not to want di. gr.

A Note of a Necessary Table.

Oftentimes tradesm^n and others buy their co^momities by ye hundreds and would
retaile by ye yound, as 4. d. the l, is 1 l. 17. s. 4. D. the hundred at 112 to

table, whose use is thus. Seek what you pay by ye l in one of ye left rows
desce^ding under pou^ds, answering to which rightwards under hu^dreds is what

CHAP. XLVII. Of the degrees of men before the Conquest.
THe first was a Hertzoge, which was the Constable of England, and now in the
Norman tongue, he is called a Duke.

The next in the Saxons speech was a Markenriue, which is called a Marquis in
the British tongue, and was chief in the horse camp.

The next in the Saxons speech was an Elderman, which is now called an Earl,
and he was Judge in the County where he dwelt, and had the third part of the
profits of the County Court toward his pains and charges.

The next in the Saxons time was a Vicecount, who in the absence of the
Elder-man did execute justice, and in ye Norman speech was called a Vicecount,
and is now called a Sheriff, or Reaue of the Shire.

The next in the Saxons speech was a Thayne, which in the British tongue is
interpreted a Dynast, and in the Norman speech a Baron, and in Latin is Thanus.

The next degree was a Vauasour, which is now called a Knight Barronet, and he
had his Manor place where he kept his Courts.

The next in the British tongue was a Norghough, which after the Danish speech
was called a Knight.

The next degree was the Edleman, which we now call the Gentleman. I read not
of Esquires, unless it were Laueffer, which the Linguists do rather
interpret a Pursiuant.

The next in the Saxons time was a Boclandman, which the Danes called a Swain,
and is now a Charterer, or Freeholder.

The next in the Saxons time was Gebures, which we call Husbandmen.

There is a degree called a Farmer, which properly is, as (some think) where a
man lets out land for a certain time for meats and drink, as you may read
yt Canutus Rex dedit firmario Ecclesiae de Glastenbury vnam hidam terrae, etc.
And this was only for the relief of old sickly Monks: but he is now a
Farmer that can get a good living, and pay but a little for it to the Lord.

There is yet another degree called Hlafordines, the which were bondmen and
are now Copyholders, and their Lords were taled Hlafords.

The estate of women is such, by the courtesy of England, that if they get to
any degree of estate, they never loose it, though they marry more basely, and
yet are capable of a higher degree, as a Lady marrying with a gentleman, takes
place as a Lady, according to the estate of her Lord or knight that was her
first husband, so likewise of a Duchess, etc. But if they debase themselves
overmuch, as to marry with a Clown, or one of base parentage, then they be
not so much esteemed amongst the better sort, though of courtesy they afford
her a place.

England thus divided into Bishoprics, it has therein 9272 parish Churches,
as you may note by the number of parishes in each shire in the table following,
and 52080 Towns besides Cities and Castles. It has also 25 Shires of which
13 be Welsh. It has 26 Bishoprics, of which 4 be Welsh. England is also
divided into 3 great Provinces, or Countries, and every of them speaking a
several and different Language, as English, Welsh, and Cornish; and their
language (which is strange) alters upon the sudden, even as the Provinces
part: for in this Town they speak English, and do not understand Welsh or
Cornish, and in the next Town Cornish, not understanding English or Welsh: but
in many things the Welsh and Cornish something agree: but now (God be praised)
England and these Provinces, with Scotland, are all under the subjection of one
King, which never was since the division thereof by Brute, to his three sons,
being then called Britain; as to Locrine the eldest, he gave this part of
Britain, called England: to Albanact the second, the Country of Albany, now
called Scotland, and to Camber the youngest, he gave the Province of Cambria,
called now Wales.

And you shall note, that the lands that Abbots and such like men enioied
before the suppressio^ thereof, did contain, 15. Carledomes, 1500. Knights
lands, 6200. Esquires lands, 100. Almes-houses, besides to the Kings Treasury
20000. l. as may appear by a petition exhibited in the 11 year of Henry the
4. at a Parliament held at Westminster, and revived in the 2. year of Henry
the 5. in a Parliament at Leicester.

Note in the reading of these brief Chronicle Notes, at the end of many of
them you shall have certain figures set, which signifies the year of the King
it happened in; because sometime the accident was not in that regnal year that
stands against the Eclesian year.

The Description and use of this New Table, called A Concordancy of Years.
THis my Concordancy of Years, has in every page 5 several rows, under
several Titles, as the first row is under the Year of our Lord, beginning at
1066. at what time the Conqueror began, and so continuing to the year 1646.
The next row is under post Conquestu^, showing how many years any year of our
Lord, or any year of any King was after the Conquest. The third is under Kings
Reign, showing how the years of the Kings answer to the years of our Lord.
The fourth is under Time expired, showing how many years it is since any of
the years placed in any of the 3 former rows, at this present year 1612. And
the last row is placed under the Title of Easter day, showing what day of the
month Easter day fell upon any year since the Conquest, to the year 1646. In
which row also be certain Capital letters placed, which be the later of the
Dominicall letters in the Leape-yeare, as in Chap. 21.

Now these things considered, you are to understand, that all the difficulty in
computating of time is when the question is only propounded by the year of
the Kings reign, and therefore if you can devise when any question is made by
any year of any King, to know in what year of our Lord it was, then the
labor is nothing: for you must know, that every year, of any King as yet,
began in one year of the Lord, and ended in ye next ensuing year which is the
cause of this difference. But to make all more plain, I will propound certain
examples both of the year of our Lord, and of the regnall year.

Quest. 1 I have a Lease for an hundred years, bearing date in April 1514,
and I would know this year 1612. what time I have remaining.
ANSWER.

Seek first the year of our Lord, 1514, and their begin to tell at the next
year forwards, calling 1515. one, 1516. two, and so proceed, until you come
to 1612: so shall you count to the number of 98 years, and so many of your 100
years be expired: But in the numbering thus, you must remember, that before and
after the change of every Prince, one and the same year of our Lord is twice
placed, therefore omit the one in your reckoning.

Or take 1514 out of 1612, so have you 98 years: Or seek (with more ease) in
the third row under Time expired, what figures stand against 1514, so shall you
find 98, as before, and so many years be expired, 1612. But if you had sought
this any other year after 1612. as 1614, then must you have seen what figures
in ye fifth row had been against 1614, as 2, the which 2 must have been added
to 98: so had you 100 years. The like for any other year after, to 1646.

Quest. 2. I have a Lease granted for 60 years, bearing date the 8 of January,
in the 6 year of Edward the 6. and I would know this year 1612, how many
years be expired.
ANSWER.

You must note first that the regnal years stand periodicall, or complete,
against the years of our Lord: so that the year Regnall stands against that
Eclesian year, or year of our Lord it ended in, and not against that it began
in: so that if a question in the Computation be put in the beginning of ye
regnal year or in this Concordancie in the ending of ye regnal year, the
demand is easy: but if ye contrary happen, it is more hard. Therefore the
matter and intent of this my work is, when a question is pronounded by the
year of any King, to know in what year of our Lord it was: ye is, whether it
were in the year of cur Lord. God that the regnall year did take beginning,
or ending in. This considered, all shall be made easy by the ensuing examples.

Seek in your Tables for Edward the 6: then in the row under K. Reign, find
the 6. year of his reign, which you shall sinde placed against 1552, against
which in the row under Time expired, is 60. My leass is therefore expired in
January the 8 day, 1612. Or having found the year of our Lord, count as in the
first question, or substract 1552 from 1612, as before: but reckoning with the
old Computation, you have 61. years, which is false: but to make all plain,
work as follows.

Notes to be observed for this new kind of of casie Computation.

YOu must first consider, that in my Calendar in the Margent upon the left
hand, the weeks be numbered from our Lady day, the which number for breuities
sake, is called the Hebdomadall Number.

Next, here is an ensuing Table, wherein the names of all the Kings and Queens
of England since the Conquest be writ: and to them is added a certain number
of weeks and days, as to Henry the 7, 21 weeks, and 3 days, which I call
Epact, which Bosco says is Intercalare, or addere. But howsoever, you may
admit the word without offense, since it is but for distinction or difference
sake which had work, (...) follows.

A Table of the Epacts for each King.
KINGS Names. Epact. KINGS Names. Epact. w. da. w. da. Will. Conqueror 29 0
Hen. the. fourth. 27 1 Will. Rufus. 24 0 Henry the fifth. 51 2 Henry the first,
18 3 Henry the sixth. 22 5 Stephen. 36 0 Edw. the fourth. 49 0 Henry the second
30 4 Edward the fifth 2 1 Richard the first. 14 5 Rich. the third. 11 2 John. 1
6 Hen. the seventh 21 3 Henry the third. 31 1 Hen. the eighth 4 0 Edward the
first. 33 5 Edw. the sixth. 44 0 Edward the second 14 6 Mary. 15 1 Edward the
third. 43 4 Elizabeth. 33 6 Richard the second 12 4 King James. 51 5

When any question is propounded by the year of any King only, without mention
of ye Eccles^^^ (...) year, you must note in what Kings reign^^ (...) what
month, and day of the month it (...) date. Next, 'find the said month, and
(...) month, and see what Hebdomadall (...) ^^^reth thereunto: that is, how
(...) it is from the 25 of March: (...) ^^^ble find the name of the King (...)
number of weeks and da^^^ (...) pact: and against the (...) numbers, viz.
(...) consider which (...)

If the E^^^^^ (...) the dem^^^ (...) year, which stands against the
Ecclesian year periodically.

But if the Hebdomadall number be the greater, the demand was made in the
beginning of the Regnall year, which answers to the Ecclesian year, or
year of our Lord next before. And of both these differences an example
follows.

Quest. 3 I have an Evidence bearing date the 13 of May, in the 23 year of
Elizabeth. I would know 1612, what year of our Lord it was, how long since,
and how long after the Conquest it was.
ANSWER.

To answer this question by this new Table, first seek ye Epact of Elizabeth,
which is 33 weeks and 6 days: then the Hebdomadall number of the 13 of May, is
13 weeks: here the Epact is ye greater. Therefore, according to the first
difference, ye demand is made in the ending of the regnal year that stands
periodically against the year of our (...) in the Concordancy. Wherefore to
resolve (...) ^^estion, find the 23 year of Elizabeth, a^^^ (...) ^^ich
stands 1581, in the first row: in (...) 15, and in the fourth is 31: whereby
(...) Evidence was dated in the 25 Anno Domini 1581, 515 af^^^ (...) that it is
31 years since, (...), see the answer to (...)

Quest. 4. I have a lease bearing date the 5 of March, in the 2 year of
Elizabeth, and is to continue for 60 years: I demand what year of our Lord it
was dated in, and consequently how many years be expired this year 1612.
ANSWER.

As in the last question, confer the Epact of Elizabeth, and the Hebdomadall
Number of the 5 of March together, noting which is the greater. In this
question the Hebdomadall number is the greater: therefore according to the
second difference, the demand was made in the beginning of the regnall year,
which answers to the year of our Lord next before.

Seek therefore the second year of Elizabeth, against which in the first row
is 1560: but for the causes before said, you must take the year next before:
that is, 1559, and that year of our Lord was the lease dated in, the tune
expired standing against the same, as 53 and so many years of my lease be
expired. But if you seek how many years be expired in any other year after
1612, work as in the first question.

Quest. 5. To find Easter day, and the rest of the moveable feasts, because
many times Deeds, etc. bear date upon such days, without mention of the
month, as also to find the Dominicall letter.
First seek the year of our Lord God, or year of the King, against either of
which in the last row upon the right hand, is the month, and day of the month
ye Easter day fell upon that year: which had, get the other moveable Feasts
thus:

From Easter day count fix Sundaies backewards, so have you Quadragessima, or
the first Sunday in Lent: then go back unto the next Tuesday, so have ye
Shroue-tuesday. Again, From Easter day forwards count five weeks, or 35
days; so have you Rogation Sunday. The next Thursday after is Ascension day.
Ten days after is Whitsunday. The next Sunday following is Trinity Sunday,
and four days after is Corpus Christi day.

Having found Easter day, see what day of the Month it happened on, and find
that day in the Calendar: for the letter answering thereto was Dominicall
letter that year.

As 1611 Easter day was the 24 of March, to which F answers in the Calendar:
therefore F was Sunday letter that year.

But when it is Leape-yeare there be two Dominicall letters, whereof that which
begins the year, and serves till Saint Mathias day, is noted by the time
in the Table when Easter day happens, and the other serving to the end of the
year is the next letter in the Alphabet that goes before: or this letter is
found by Easter day, as before.

Quest 6. I have a deed bearing date upon Wednesday day in the Easter week, in
the year of our Lord 1556. I desire this present year 1612. to know in what
Kings year it was, what month, what day of the Month, and how long since it
was dated.
ANSWER.

First seek 1556, against which under Easter day, stands April 5. Wherefore
Easter day was the 5 of April, D being Dominicall letter: so that Wednesday
in Easter week was the 8 of April, G standing for the same: then you may see
it was in Queen Mary's time: and remembering what was said before) in the third
year of her reign, and that it is 56 years since, and 490 after the Conquest.

Now if any evidence bear date upon the Kalends, Nones, or Ides of any month,
they be easily found in the Calendar without further speech, because they
stand against the ordinary day of the month.

Note by ye name of every King deceased, you shall find one of these words,
Periodicall, which signifies the King reigned so many years as be in the
Concordancie, beside odd months, etc. or Defective, which signifies he did
not reign complete so many years, but only wrote of so many.

Quest. 7. How shall I make a Concordancie of principal times of note, that
were in being long since?
ANSWER.

In the ensuing Table is set down how many years it is since at this present
year 1612.

Since the Creation 5582 Flood. 3925 Promise of Abraham. 3558 Israelits
departure out of Egypt 3128 Entrance of Brute into England. 2719 Building of ye
Temple of Salomo^. 2648 Building of Rome. 2363 Captivity of Babylon. 2217 Death
of Alexander 1936. Birth of Christ, 1612 passion of Christ. 1579 England
received the faith. 1432 Conquest of England. 546 Inuenting of Printing. 152
Order of Templars 494 Time ye London and Paris were commanded to be paued. 426
Building of London bridge with stone. 435


But if you seek how long it is since any of these times after 1612, seek in
your Table what number stands against yt proposed year of our Lord in the
row under Time expired, and that add to the time of note proposed, and if the
demand were made in any year before 1612, take ye number under ye title Time
expired answering to the year of our Lord out of ye number in the former
table: as 1600 I would know how long it was the^ after the Creation: therefore
according to what is said, I take 12 from 5582, so have I 5570, my demand.

Quest. 8. How shall I find the Golden number, Circle of the Sun, and Epact
by this Concordancy?
ANSWER.

To the time of Post Conquestum add three, and from the Total reject 19 so
often as you may, or divide by 19: so is ye which remains the Golden number,
and the quotient, or number of 19 rejected, the number of Reuolutions of the
said Circle since the Conquest.

Now for the Circle of the Sun, to the time of post Conquestum, add 11,
dividing by 28, as before by 19, so is the remainder the Circle of the Sun.

For the Epact work as in the 30. Chapter.

To know if figures be mistaken in the Concordancy.
Add Anno Domini, and Time expired together, for they must make both 1612, I
mean in none of the Tables after 1612.

Also, add Time expired and post Conquestum both together: for they must make
1612.

Also take 1066 from the proposed year, and the remainder is post conquestum.

Lastly, take Ann. Dom. proposed from the present year of our Lord, so have
you Time expired. Let this suffice for the brief use of this Concordancy.

Of the four times of pleading, called Terms, and of their Returns.

For the hearing and determining of all kind of co^tracts, discords, and such
like in yt common weal, there be four times in the year appointed, which be
called Terms, because in those days the learned Judges set Finis and
Terminus, Contentionum, or Terminus litis, that is, an end of contention and
debate betwixt party and party.

Now every of these four Terms consist of four, five or eight Returns:
every Return of four days, and every day serving unto a several purpose.

Note therefore that every Term has but part, or all of these 6 kind of
Returns, viz. Crastino Octabis, Quindeno, Tres Mense, and Quinque, as you may
gather hereafter. Every of which Returns has a Basis, or known day, from
whence they take their denomination, and be reckoned. The signification of
which six kind of Returns is thus:

Crastino is the morrow after the Basis, or day nominated, as Crastino
Trinitatis, is the morrow after Trinity Sunday, Trinity Sunday being the Basis,
and the day that gives the denomination. Octabis is 8 days after inclusiuely.
Quind. is 15 days after, Tres, that day three-weekes, Mense that day month,
and Quinq. that day five weeks.

Now every of these Returns has four several, days whereupon they consist:
The first whereof has double signification, the one is the day of Return, and
the other the day of Essoyne for the defendant in a personal action, or the
Tenant in are all action, to be essoyned. The second, is the day of
Exceptions, for the Plaintiff or Demaundant to lay an exception, if no Essoyne
be cast, that the Defendant shall not be essoyned, or amerced. The third is,
Returna Breuium, that is, the day whereon the Sheriff must return the writ.
And the fourth is the day of appearance for Parties and Jurors in the Court of
Common Pleas.

But if so any of these days fall upon an Holyday, that is no Court day: as in
Easter Term upon Ascension day, in Trinity Term upon S. John Baptists day,
in Michaelmas Term upon All Saints day, and in Hillary Term upon the
Purification of our Lady, or upon any Sunday, (all which be not Court days,)
then must the next day following serve for both. As if the Essoyne day fell
upon a Sunday, then Monday must serve for Essoyne day, and day of Exception
both.

As for these days, they have all most use in the Court of Common pleas, where
all suits commence by original etc. But for Latitats, or other process upon a
bill certain, it is upon a day certain, as Die lunae proxi, post Purifi.
which must always be reckoned from the essoyne day.

In the Star Chamber, Chauncery, Court of Wards, and Court of Requests, they
use none of these Returns, but only the day of appearance, which is quarto
die post.

Yet note well, if a Capias, Exigent, Scri-facias, or Destringas be executed
after the day of Essoyne by the Sheriff, or a Commission seat upon out of any
of the foresaid Courts, after the said Essoyne day, it is neither justifiable,
nor warrantable: but for that these Terms may be found out easily by every one
for ever, as also for that it is most fit for all men to know, I have devised
in performance thereof, the ensuing Table for their sakes, whose use is thus.

To find the beginning and ending of the Terms by a new Table for ever in a
most easy manner.

By the 32 chapter you must first get ye Prime and Dominicall letter, which
had, enter this little ensuing table, finding ye Prime in the margent upon ye
left hand, from whence proceed rightwards, until you come under the Dominical
letter of ye proposed year, noting in the common angle the number answering
thereunto, and also the number in the head of the Table, over the said
Dominical letter.

answering to which upon your right hand, is the beginning and ending of every
Term, under their proper Titles.

Example. 1613. The Prime is 18. and the Dominicall letter C, as in the 32
Chapter: then I enter the former little Table, and find 18 upon the left side,
and so proceeding until I come under C. I find 7 in the body of the Table,
and 2 over C: the which 7 and 2 I find in the Table of Terms, in the rows
under inter, min. whereby proceeding rightwards, I may conclude that Easter
Term shall begin April 21, and end May 17.

Trinity Term begins June 4, and ends June 23, and so forth. The like for any
other year. As for the Returns of every Term, they be these that follow.

Easter Term has 5 Returns. Quindeno paschae, Tres paschae, Mense paschae,
Quinque paschae, and Crastino Ascensionis.
Trinity Term has 4 Returns. Crastino Trinitatis, Octabis Trinitatis,
Quindeno Trinitatis, and Tres Trinitatis.
Hillary Term has 4 Returns. Octabis Hilar. Quind. Hill. Crastino
Purificationis, and Octab. Purificationis.
Michaelmas Term has 8 Returns. Octa. Michael, Quind. Mich, Tres Mich.
Mense Mich. Crastino Animarum, Crastino Martini, Octa. Marti. Quindeno Marti.

Now if you would know what day any of these Returns happen upon, remember
what is faid before, and it is easy.

The old and vulgar Rule remembered in diverse Books, whereby to know the
Law-dayes, in the Court of Arches, the Audience of Canterbury, the Spiritual
and Civil laws throughout the year, which I am bold to insert, since it is
proper to no particular Author.
Michaelmas Term.
S. Luke. S. Simon and Jude. S. Faith. S. Edward. All Saints. S. Martine.
Edmond K. S. Katherin. S. Andrew. The Conception of our Lady.
Ye must well understand, that the first day ensuing each of the Feasts set
down before every Term, the Court of ye Arches is kept in the forenoone at
Bow Church: and in the afternoon the same first day, is kept in Southwarke the
Admiral Court for civilly causes.

The second day after each of these feasts, ye Audience Court of Canterbury is
held in yt Consistory in Paul's in the fore-noone: and the Prerogatine Court of
Canterbury is kept in the same place in the afternoon the same day.

The third day following any of those feasts, the Bishop of Londons Court of
Consistory is holden in Paul's in the fore-noone: and in the same place is the
Court of the Queens highness Comissioners upon Appeals, and the court of
Delegates holden in the afternoon the same third day.

Hillarie Term.
S. Hillary. S. Wolstane. Conuers. of Paul. S. Blase. S. Scolastice. S.
Valentine. Ashwedensday S. Matthias. S. Chadde. Perpet. and Feli S. Gregory.
An. of our L.
Understand that the four first Feasts of this Term be never changed, but are
certain; the other are sometime kept, and sometime omitted, after the course of
the year altered. And if it so chance, ye one of those feasts be
Ashwedensday, that are after S. Blase day, so that the same Law-day after
Ashwedensday cannot be kept, because the Law-day of ye other feast does light
on the same day: the second Law-day after Ashwedensday shall be kept, and the
other omitted.

And if the Law-day after Ashwedensday be the next day after S. Blase, then
shall all and every of those days be observed in order, as they may be held
conveniently.

And note, that although Ashwedensday be the 7 in order, yet it has no
certain place, but is changed as the feast of Easter causes it.

Easter Term.
The 15. day after Easter. Saint Alphage. Saint Mark Euangelift. Invention of
the Cross. Gordian. Saint Dunstane, Ascension day.
In this Term, the first sitting is always kept the Monday being the 15 day
after Easter, and so after the feasts here noted, which shall next follow by
course after Easter, and ye like space being kept between other feasts, the
rest of the law-daies are kept the third day after the Ascension, which is the
last of this Term. And if it happen that ye Ascension day do come before any
of those feasts aforesaid, then they are omitted for that year. And likewise,
if any of those days come before the 15 day after Easter, those days are also
omitted.

Trinity Term.
Trinitie-sunday. Corpus Christi. Boniface bishop S. Barnabe. S. Botolph. S.
John. S. Paul. Tr. S. Tho. S. Swithin. S. Margaret. S. Anne.
Remember that the Law-daies of this Term are changed by the means of
Pentecost; and the first sitting is holden always the first day after Trinity
Sunday, and the second Law-day is holden the first day after Corpus Christi
day, except it fall on some day above named, which chances sometime, and then
the fitter day is kept. And after ye second session account four days or
there about, and then look which is the next feast, and the first law-day
after the said feast shall be the third session: the other law-daies follow in
order, but so many of them are kept, as for the time of the year is thought
meet.

Note generally that every day is called a Law-day, that is not Sunday or
holiday, and that if the feast day being known of any Court day in any Term,
and the first or second day following be Sunday, then the Court day is kept
after the said holiday or feast day.

First of all, these days are not altered, except they light on Sunday, or
some Holiday, and every day is called a Law day, unless it be Sunday or
Holiday.

Note page 241. l. 10. Corpus day is omitted.

Wages for Boat-men, and for their Barges and Boats, confirmed by Act of
Parliament, Ann. 6. H. 8. Cap. 7.
Whereas Watermen, or Masters of Barges and Boats, did (as they do)
continually practice to raise the wages or hire of their Boats, breaking
thereby ye ancient custom and reasonable wages, and so abused the great, and
exacted on the poor, whereby many assaults and frayes wore (and sometime are)
committed, which has often caused manslaughter: and also by reason of that
east and unconscionable gain, the servants of many House-holders and
Husbandmen near adjoining where such Boats or Ferries were, did daily run
from their masters and become Watermen. For the avoiding of which, and many
such other inconveniences, it was ordained by the former Statute of H. 8. that
these laudable customs, and ancient orders of wages for Boat-men should be
observed and kept, upon pains that the offender should forfeit treble the fare:
and that all Bailiffes, Constables, and other the Kings officers next adjoining
unto the Ferries, upon complaint to them made, or to any of them by them that
be grieved in that behalf, to arrest them, and commit them to ward for their
misdemeanour, and that they should make fine for the same. All which, to the
end the poor and simple should not be deceived, nor the better sort deluded:
and to the end every one might in that behalf certainly know, what wages was
due to every Ferry, whereby both parties might know: the one when he gives, and
the other when he receives abountifull reward. And that they should not
murmr when a Gentleman gives three pence, or four pence for crossing the
water, I have taken pains to set down the wages allowed to every Ferry by the
Statute, as follows.

First, for wages for Boat-men, and for their Barges or Boats, or for a Barge
from London to Grauesend, four shillings, or else every person and his male
two pence, so it pass not four shillings. From London to Erith, Greenewich,
Grastorrocke, or Purfleete twelve pence, or else for every person and his
fardell a penny, so it pass not 12 d. From London to Wolwich, thirteen pence
for a Boat or Wherry, that is, the Tyde-boat, or else every person a half
penny. From London to Greenewich four pence, or else a half penny for every
person and his fardell. From London Bridge, Old Swan, the Crane in the Vintry,
S. Mary Queries, or Paul's Wharfe, to Westminster, or Lambeth, or from
Westminster or Lambeth to any of the foresaid places 3 pence, or else every
person a halfe-peny. From Blacke-Friers, Bride-well and the Temple to
Westminster or Lambeth, two pence with their males, or a halfe-peny for every
person, so it amount not above two pence. From Westminster to Lambeth, or
Strand-gate, or any way crossing the water, a half penny. For a boat from
London to Mortlake 12 d. or else every person 2 d. with his male. And from
those places above named to London, for a Boat or Barge, the like sums of
money. Watermen rowing in great Barges we Lords, or other persons, to have 6 d.
the day, and find themselves, unless they row to Mortlake, etc. then to have 8
d. a peecs by day, and find themselves.
