Here begins a merry I est of Dan^ Hew Munk of Leicestre, and how he was
four times slain and once hanged.










IN old time there was in Lecester town
An Abbay of Munks of great renown
As ye shall now after here
But amongst them all was one there
That passed all his Brethern iwis
His name was Dane Hew so have I blis
This Munk was yung and lusty
And to fair women he had a fansy
And for them he laid great wait in deed
In Leicester dwelled a Tailor I reed
Which wedded a woman fair and good
they looued each other by my hood
Seven year and somewhat more
Dane Hew looued this taylers Wife sore,
And thought always in his mind
When he might her alone find
And how he might her assay
And if she would not to say him nay
Upon a day he said fair woman free
without I have my pleasure of thee
I am like to go from my wit
Sir she said I have many a shrewd fit
Of my husband every day,
Dame he said / say not nay
My pleasure I must have of thee
what so ever that it cost me
She answered and said if it must needs be
Come to morrow unto me
For then my husband rides out of the town
and then to your will I will be bown
And then we may make good game
and if ye come not ye be to blame
But Dane Hew first tell thou me
What that my reward shall be
Dame he said by my fay
twenty nobles of good money
For we will make good cheer this day:
And so they kissed and went their way
The tailor came home at even tho
Like as he was wunt to do
And his wife told him all and some
How Dane Hew in the morning would come
and what her meed of him should be
What? dame thou art mad so mot I thee
Will thou me a Cuckolds hood give?
That should me shrewdly grieve,
Nay Sir she said, by sweet saint John
I will keep my self a good woman
And get thee money also iwis
For he has made thereof a promise
To morrow early here to be
I know well he will not fail me
And I shall lock you in the chest
that ye out of the way may be milt
And when dane Hew comes hither early
About five of the clock truly
For at that time his hour is set
to come hither then without any let
Then I shall you call full lightly
Look that ye come unto me quickly
And when the day began to appeer in ye morning
Dane Hew came thither ward fast renning
He thought that he had past his hour
then softly he knocked at the taylers door
She rose up and bad him come near
And said Sir welcome be ye here
Good morrow (he said) gentle mistress
Now tell me where your husband is
That we may be sure indeed
Sir she said so God me speed
He is forth of the town
And will not come home til after noon
With that Dane Hew was well content
And lightly in arms he did her hent
And thought to have had good game
Sir she said let be for shame
For I will know first what I shall have
For when I have it I will it not crave
Give me twenty Nobles first
And do with me then what ye list
By my Preesthood quoth he than
thou shall have in Gold and silver anon
Thou shall no longer crave it of me
Lo my mistress where they be
And in her lap he it threw
Gramercy she said unto Dane Hew
Dane Hew thought this wife to assay
abide sir she said til I have laid it away
For so she thought it should be best
With that she opened then a Chest
then Dane Hew thought to have had her alone
But the tailor out of the chest anon
And said sir Munk if thou will stand
I shall give thee a stroke with my brand
that thou shall have but little lust unto my wife
And lightly without any more strife
He hit Dane Hew upon the head
That he fell down stark dead
Thus was he first slain in deed
Alas then said his wife with an evil speed
Have ye slain this munk so soon?
Whither now shall we run or gone?
There is no remedy then said he
without thou give good counsel to me
To convey this false priest out of the way
That no man speak of it ne say
That I have killed him or slain
Or else that we have done it in vain
Yea sit (she said) let him abide
Til it be soon in the even tide
Then shall we him well convey
For ye shall bear him into the Abbay
And set him straight up by the wall
and come your way forth withal
The Abbot sought him all about
For he heard say that he was out
And was very angry with him in deed
and would never rest so God me speed
Until Dane Hew that he had found
and bad his man to seek him round
About the place, and to him say
That he come speak with me straight way
Forth went his man til at the last
Being abroad his eye he cast
Aside: where he Dane Hew did see
and unto him then straight went he
And thinking him to be alive
He said, Dane Hew so mut I thrive
I have sought you and meruel how
that I could not find you til now
Dane Hew stood as still as he that could not tell
what he should say, no more he did good nor il
With that the Abbots man said with good intent
Sir ye must come to my Lord, or else you be shent
When Dane Hew answered never a dele.
He thought he would ask some counsel
Then to the Abbot he began him hye
I pray you my Lord come by and by
And see where Dane Hew stands straight by the wall
and will not answer what so ever I call
And he stareth and looks upon one place
Like a man that is out of grace
And one word he will not speak for me
Get me a staf (quoth the Abbot) and I shall see
And if he shall not unto me answer.
Then when the Abbot came there
And saw him stand up right by the wall
He then to him began to call
And said thou false Bribour thou shall aby
Why keep thou not thy service truly
Come hither he said with an evil speed
But no word that Dane Hew answered in deed
what whorso^ (quod the Abbot) why spekest not thou?
Speak or else I make God avow
I will give thee such a stroke upon thy head
That I shall he gave him such a rap
That he fell down at that clap
Thus was he the second time slain
and yet he wroght them much more pain
As ye shall afterward here full well
Sir quoth the abbots an ye have done il
For ye have slain Dane Hew now
And suspended this place I make God a vow
What remedy (quod the Abbot than?)
Yes quoth his man by sweet Saint John
If ye would me a good reward give
That I may be the better while that I live
Yes (quod the Abbot) xl. shillings thou shall have
And if thou can mine honor save
My Lord I tell you so mot I thee
Unto such a Taylers house haunted he
To woo his pretty wife certain
and thither I shall him bring again
And there upright I shall him set
that no man shall it know or wit
And then every man will sain
That the Tailor has him slain
For he was very angry with him
That he came to his wife so often time
Of his counsel he was well appaid
and his man took up dane Hew that braid
And set him at the Taylers door anon
and ran home as fast as he might gone
The Tailor and his wife were in bed
And of Dane Hew were sore afraid
Lest that he would them bewray
and to his wife began to say
All this night I have dreamed of this false caitife
that he came to our door (quoth he to his wife)
Jesus (quoth his wife) what man be ye
That of a dead man so sore afraid ye be?
For me thought that you did him slo
With that the Tailor to the door began go
And a Polax in his hand
and saw the Munk by the door stand
Whereof he was sore afraid
And still he stood and no word said
Til he spoke unto his wife
Dame now have I lost my life
Without I kill him first of all
Forth he took his Polax or mall
And hit Dane Hew upon the head
that he fell down stark dead
And thus was Dane Hew three times slain
And yet he wrought him a train
Alas quoth the Taylers wife
This caitife does us much strife
Dame he said what shall we now do?
Sir she said so mote go
The Munk in a corner ye shall lay
til to morrow before the day
Then in a Sack ye shall him thrast
and in the Mil dam ye shall him cast
I counsel it you for the best surely
So the Tailor thought to do truly
In the morning he took Dane Hew in a Sack
And laid him lightly upon his back
Unto the Mil Dam he began him hye
and there two thieves he did espy
That fro the Mil came as fast as they might
But when of the Tailor they had a sight
They were abashed very sore
For they had thought the miller had come thore
For of him they were sore afraid
that the Sack there down they laid
And went a little aside I cannot tell where
And with that the Tailor saw the sack lie there
Then he looked therein anon
And he saw it was full of Baron
Dane Hew then he laid down there
And so the bacon away did bear
Til he came home and that was true
the thieves took up ye sack with dane Hew
And went their way til they came home
One of the thieves said to his wife anon
Dame look what is in that sack I thee pray
For there is good bacon by my fay
Therefore make us good cheer lightly
the wife ran to the Sack quickly
And when she had the Sack unbound
the dead Munck therein she found
Then she cried out and said alas
I see here a marvelous case
That ye have slain Dane Hew so soon
Hanged shall ye be if it be known
Nay good dame said they again to her
For it has been the false miller
Then they took Dane Hew again
and brought him to the mil certain
Where they did steal the Bacon before
And there they hanged Dane Hew for store
Thus was he once hanged in deed
and ye thieves ran ho^e as fast as they could speed
The Millers wife rose on the morning erly
And lightly made her self ready
To fetch some Bacon at the last
But when she looked up she was a gast
That she saw the Munk hang there
She cried out and put them all in fere
And said here is a chance for the nones
for here hangs the false Munk by cocks bones
That has been so Lecherous many a day
And with men's wives used to play
Now some body has quit his meed full well
I trow it was the Devil of Hell
And our Bacon is stolen away
this I call a shrewd play
I wot not what we shall this winter eat
What wife (quoth the Miller) ye must all this forget
And give me some good counsel I pray
How we shall this Munk convey
And privily of him we may be quit
Sir she said that shall you lightly wit
Lay him in a corner til it be night
and we shall convey him or it be day light
The Abbot has a close here beside
therein he has a good horse untied
Go and fetch him home at night
and bring him unto me straight
And we shall set him there upon in deed
and bind him fast so God me speed
And give him a long pole in his hand
Like as he would his enmies withstand
And under his-arme we will it thrust
Like as he would fiercely just
Fo (she said) as ye well know
the Abbot has a Mare gentle and low
Which ambleth well and trotteth in no wise
But in the morning when the Abbot does rise
He commands his mare to him to be brought
For to see his workmen if they lack ought
And upon the mare he rides as I you tell
For to see and all things be well
And when this Horse sees this mare anon
Unto her he will lightly run or gone
When the Miller this understood
He thought his wives counsel was good
And held him well therewith content
and ran for the horse verament
And when he the horse had fet at the last
Dane Hew upon his back he cast
And bound him to the horse full sure
that he might the better endure
To ride as fast as they might ren
Now shall ye know how the Miller did then
He took the horse by the bridle anon
and Dane Hew sitting therdn
And brought him that of the mare he had a sight
Then the horse ran full right
The Abbot looked a little him beside
and saw that Dane Hew toward him began ride
And was almost out of his mind for fear
When he saw Dane Hew come so near
He cried help / for the love of the trinite
For I see well that Dane Hew avenged will be
Alas I am but a dead man
and with that from his Mare he ran
The abbots men ran on Dane Hew quickly
and gave him many strokes lightly
With Clubs and staves many one
They cast him to the earth anon
So they killed him once again
thus was he once hanged and four times slain
And buried at the last as it was best
I pray God send us all good rest.
Amen.
