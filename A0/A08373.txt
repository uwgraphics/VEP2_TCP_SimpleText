The two Nottinghamshire Lovers, or the Maid of Standon of Nottinghamshire, and
the Leicestershire Man, which were linked together contrary to their Friends
minds, but she was inflamed in love, that she requested him from thence to go;
and he resolved her so to do, appointing the place where they should meet, but
it was a heavy meeting as ere was known, as in the Ditty shall be shown.
To the tune of, I fear I shall stay too long.


IN Nottinghamshire,
As late I did hear,
there lived two Lovers true,
Whose heart was linked fast,
Whilst life did last,
but mark what did ensue.
Oh this was all her song,
My Love, I suffer wrong,
And I fear thou will stay too long.
In Standon she was borne,
That lived thus forlorn,
and her name was called Anne Hall.
But her own friends did seek,
Her mind for to break,
which caused her great downfall.
And this was, etc.
This Yongman in Leicestershire,
Was borne as I do hear,
and his name was called John Brown,
But in this love he was
Not so constant as this Less,
as hereby shall he plainly found.
But this was, etc.
Her friends would not agree
That married she should be,
to him that she best did love:
Though she did them entreat,
They her misused and beat,
in hope that her mind would move.
Oh this was, etc.
Her friends to her would say,
If you will him denay,
and marry some other man,
Then you shall want for naught
That for money can be bought,
take you him that has house and land.
But this was, etc.
But she was thus resolved,
Till death her dissolved,
not to change like the wavering wind:
Like to the Turtle Dove,
So true she did prove,
and she was steadfast in her mind.
Oh but this, etc*


That when that she did see
Her friends would not agree,
she moan made unto her Love
Saying she would go,
With him in weal or woe,
and would prove like the Turtle dove.
Oh but this, etc.
Thus he replied again,
My mind I will explain,
and will tell thee what I will do;
Meet me in thy fathers Land,
And here is my heart and hand,
to morrow with thee I Will go.
Oh but this, etc.
To the same she did agree,
And appointed presently,
the place where she should him meet,
Then home she went again,
For money to maintain
her self and her lover sweet*
Oh but this, etc.
And when the hour came,
Then she returned again,
to the place where he did appoint:
But when that she came there,
She saw him not appear,
and then she began to faint.
Oh but this, etc.
Then down she sat her strait,
And thus began to write,
complaining most pittiously,
Of her crosses she
Had endured patiently,
but then was resolved to dye.
Oh but this, etc.
False-hearted one,
That breeds my moan,
and does cause me thus to complain:
Oh I will never trust
To one so unjust,
for I find that it is in vain,
But this was all her song,
My love, I suffer wrong,
And I fear thou will stay too long.
The second part.
To the same tune.


HE so swore to me,
That true he would be,
as the Turtle to her Mate,
Oh but him I find
Much like to the wind*
that blows uncertain state,
But this is still my song,
My love I suffer wrong,
And I fear thou will stay too long.
His urging eyes,
Like to the pleasant skies,
that in April often do show,
Yet ere that you are aware,
They changed are,
to stormy wind and blow.
Therefore, etc.
Seeing thee here I find,
To be so unkind
to me which so dear loved thee,
I am resolved in heart,
From the world to depart,
thou again shall me never see.
Therefore, etc.
To Father and Mother,
I speak above all other,
who are the causers of my woe,
You would not give consent,
Therefore you may repent,
you have wrought my overthrow.
Therefore, etc.
When I did you entreat,
Then was I sorely beat,
and you said him I should not marry,
You stood for worldly gain,
Which breeds now my pain,
for my love I do now miscarry.
Therefore, etc.
To you my love likewise,
Whom I did once surmise,
would have proved more true to me:
But you I false do find,
And to me so unkind,
therefore now I here must dye.
Therefore, etc.


This letter of my woe,
With me shall be to show,
in the place where you me shall find,
For to declare aright,
The causes of my spite,
and the truth of a troubled mind.
Therefore, etc,
Then with her knife,
She ended her life,
in the place that appointed was,
Where her love to see,
Came thither presently,
and found her dead on the grass.
Therefore, etc.
Then with his Rapier he,
Himself immediately
did kill hard by his love:
Straight after they were found
Bleeding upon the ground,
near to a pleasant Grove.
Therefore, etc.
Her friends when they did hear
Sore grieved they were:
yet unto the place did come,
And from her pocket they
There pulled out straightway,
this letter of grief and moan.
Therefore, etc.
When this they read and hear,
They stricken were with fear,
and cried most pittiously:
Confessing of it true,
But mark what did ensue,
O they after did quickly dye.
Therefore, etc.
Let other Parents now,
Not seek to break a vow,
that is made between Lovers true*
Lest all too late I say,
They work their lives decay,
as this story does plainly show.
And now to end my song,
My love, I suffer wrong,
And I fear thou will stay too long.
FINIS.
