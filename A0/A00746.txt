The Calling of the JEWS.

A PRESENT TO IVDAH AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL that joined with him, and to
JOSEPH (the valiant tribe of EPHRAIM) and all the house of ISRAEL that joined
with him.

The Lord give them grace, that they may return and seek JEHOVAH their God,
and DAVID their King, in these latter days.

There is prefixed an Epistle unto them, written for their sake in the Hebrew
tongue, and translated into English.

A BRIEF AND SUMMARIE DECLARATION OF THE PROPHECIES of the old and the new
Testament, so far as they concern the calling of the JEWS.
THE invisible things of God, that are to be seen in all his works, shine
most clearly in the Church. Wherein, as David says, Psalm. 29. 9. he utters
all his glory. But above all, the Church of the Jews carries the lively print
and mark of his praises. What things did he for them? Nay, what did he not in
Egypt, and at the red sea, in the wilderness, and Land of promise, when they
were in Babylon, the seventy years captivity, and after, by sending of his Son
among them?

These things were the first act (as a man may call it) of the great and
glorious works of God toward that nation.

But the Catastrophe, or shutting up, is no less, if not much more, to be
admired: How, for refusing Christ, that came into the world, to save them, and
shamefully nayling him upon the Cross, they are become a renegate people, now
1600 years together, without Church, without Commonwealth, without form, or
face of government, good or bad: their pleasant land turned into a wilderness:
their fruitful Country, into a dry and barren Desert. How, for all that, he
leaves them not without comfort. Nay, he lifts up their hearts with a
certain expectation of most high and ample promises. Such and so great as are
altogether incredible, but that the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. Some of
the choice and principal, not following Jewish fables, but the undoubted
Oracles of the word of God, it shall not be amiss, before we proceed further,
to lay down in certain Aphorisms or Positions. Which may all be reduced into
five heads.

1. The first head concerns the Jews refusal of Christ. Refusing Christ.

and possessed, Esaias 14. 2. and 61. 5. Joel 3. 8. Amos 9. 12. Obad. verse. 17.
19. shall willingly or perforce come under Christ's obedience.

The truth of each position, I will not here stand to discuss. This Treatise
following (where they are noted in the margent) does abundantly prove them all.

The time drawing near, wherein these things foretold so long before, come
now to be accomplished, how sweet a thing it is, to look into the prophesies
that give assurance of it.

May it therefore please the judicious and learned Reader, to weigh the
Scriptures following: which prosessedly, and of purpose, speak of these
things. Some in plain and evident terms, other more obscurely, but all laid
together, cast such a light, as leave this doctrine without exception. But
before we enter upon the particular Texts, take some few rules, for the better
understanding of the prophesies of this kind: As Well touching the threatened
desolation, as for the conversion of this people, and the enemy that shall fall
before them.

1. The desolation spoken of, Cities without inhabitant, houses without men,
the land desolate, Esaias 6. 11. The mountains, hills, rivers, valleys, waste.
Ezech. 36. 4. No King, no Prince, no form, or face of Church, or
Commonwealth, good or bad, and that for many days, Hosh. 3. 4. Were never
before, but now are truly verified in the height of them, some 1600 years
together, since they rejected Christ.

2. Though the Prophets, when they handle these things, thunder against the
sins of their own age, that is, but to note the Justice of the future
desolation: for God is righteous to punish in the children, their forefathers
faults, when they walk in the same steps of disobedience, Esaias 14. 21.
Touching their conversion.

1. Where Israel, Judah, Tsion, Jerusalem, etc. are named in this argument, the
Holy Ghost means not the spiritual Israel, or Church of God collected of the
Gentiles, no nor of the Jews and Gentiles both (for each of these have their
promises severally and apart) but Israel properly descended out of Jacobs
loins.

The same judgment is to be made of their returning to their land and ancient
seats, the conquest of their foes, the fruitfulnes of their soil, the
glorious Church they shall erect in the land it self of Judah, their bearing
rule far and near. These and such like are not Allegories, setting forth in
terrene similitudes or deliverance through Christ (whereof those were types and
figures) but meant really and literally of the Jews. It was not possible to
devise mote express or evident terms, then the Spirit of purpose uses to
cut off all such construction. Neither were Josias or Cyrus more plainly named
hundred of years before they were borne, then these things are plainly
delivered for the confirming of that peoples faith. Wherefore we need not be
afraid to aver and mainteyne, that one day they shall come to Jerusalem
again, be Kings and chief Monarchs of the earth, sway and govern all, for
the glory of Christ that shall shine among them. And that is it Lactantius
says, Lib. 7. Cap. 15. The Roman name (I will speak it, because it must one
day be) shall be taken from the earth, and the Empire shall return to Asia,
and again shall the East bear dominion, and the West be in subjection.

2. Such promises of the Gospel as come in order after that desolation, or
after mercy to be showed to the gentiles, are without question to be referred
to these times.

3. Nay, generally all Evangelical promises made unto them, seeing they
neither at the first received the gospel, nor ever hitherto enjoyed that
peace, plenty, and prosperity, which the promises do purport, cannot but aim
at somewhat that is yet to come.

4. The great and glorious things, which in the height and excellency thereof,
are spoken peculiarly to them, do in their measure and degree, appertain in
common to all the faithful. And so in the new Testament, are ordinarily
applied: Whereof see more in this treatise following upon Esaias, 54.

5. Their conversion unto Christ in the last days, commonly is intimated by
turning from Idolatry. Which howsoever the Jews be not now infected with, (if
you speak of bowing to stocks and stones) was then the maine sin of the
times. And takes us forth this worthy lesson that it is mere Idolatry, and a
worship of false Gods, whatsoever worship looks not to God in Christ, which
John also teaches. 1 Ioh. 5. 20. 21. When having laid down the doctrine, that
Jesus Christ is the true God, and life everlasting, immediately he adds,
Little children keep your selves from Idols. This rule for the exposition of
the Prophets, I learn of the Apostle, Romans 11. 27. vouching Esaias 27. 9. (which
speaks of their casting away of Idols) as a principal place to warrant the
calling of the Jews.

6. Albeit the through coming in of the Gentiles, for all nations with one
consent to receive Christ, be put off to the Jews conversion, yet that nothing
hinders but the places that speak of the same, may well serve to warrant the
first inceptions of their calling. And so does James cite them. Act. 15, 16,
17. out of Amos cap. 9. 11, 12. and Paul, Romans 9. 25, 26. out of Hosea Chap. 1.
10.

7. The conversion of the Gentiles, is many times intimated by the Israelites
maistring of them, possessing them for servants, and for handmaides as Esaias,
14. 2. Amos 9. 12. Obadiah, verse. 19. Which is not meant so much of a temporal
subduing, as of a spiritual joining with them, in seeking of the Lord; yet so
as the chief sovereignty and stroke of keeping men within the lists of their
subjection and obedience unto Christ, shall remain among the Jews. And so
James teaches us to expound those phrases, Act. 15. 17. Where that which Amos
says, that they (the Israelites) may possess the remnant of Edom, James
renders, that the residue of men may seek after the Lord.

The enemy whom indeed they shall conquer, root out, and destroy, after they
have groaned long under his hard yoke and bondage, is not always represented
by one and the same name. But sometimes more obscurely, by one or other of the
capital enemies of Gods people, Moab, Edom, Rabba, that is to say, the
Ammonites, Asshur, Esaias 25. 10.
Iauan; whether because the holy Ghost would thereby Esaias 34. 5. 6. and 63.
note the cancred malice of that tyrant to the Church: or Psalm. 110. 6.
that those which inhabit the seat of these people, shall ioyn Esa. 30. 31. and
31. 8.
hands and fall in the same destruction. Hosh. 13. 13. (compared with Hosh. 14.
3.)


Sometimes his qualities and conditions paint him out: Leuiathan, a Serpent, a
Dragon, Esaias 27. 1. Sometimes you have him more plainly decyphered, either by
the country from whence he deriueth his pedigree. Gog of the land Mica. 5. 5.
6.
Zach. 9. 13.
of Magog, Ezech. 38. 2. or else by his territory and dominion, the King of
the North. Dan. 11. 40. the Dragon which is in the sea, Esa. 27. 1. But by all
these names, one and the same enemy is understood, which marvelously cleereth
the place in Ezechiel, chap. 38. 17. where the Lord by his Prophet speaks to
Gog in this wise; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in ancient time, by my
servants the Prophets of Israel which prophesied in those days and years. He
can not moan himself nor Daniel, which was but one of his age, much less
Zachary that came after, but he means the ancient Prophets long before, who
spoke of the same person, though not by the same name.

These things premised, we come now to the particulars, wherein my meaning is,
not to open every hard word, or dark and obscure phrase, much less to
endeavor in every place a full exposition of the text, That must be had from
other the godly and learned interpreters. But only to point at the heads of
those Scriptures, and that but so far as they concern the thing we deal
with, to lead us by the hand in the discovery of this heigh and heavenly
secret, for that name the Apostle gives it, Romans 11. 25. The reader that would
profit thereby, I desire to have the text before him as he goes. The
comparing whereof, will bring great light to things that otherwise may seem
obscure, and that he be not deceived in the chapters, and verses, I follow not
(where any difference is) the Hebrew, but number them as they are in the
English translation.

Balaams Prophecy, Numb. 24. 14. to the last verse of the Chapter.
THE Spirit of God that sat in the mouth of this wicked man, mastring and
ouer-ruling his tongue, to speak things tending heighly to Gods praise, and
the comfort of his people, does here utter a Prophecy of the kingdom of
Christ, to be set up among the Jews in the latter end of the world. It is (for
the maine matter) one 6 Posit. Last days.
entire prophecy: but broken off by several proems. The sum of all is: that
the Jews shall destroy their enemies, But themselves must before that, endure
a long and tedious Verse. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19 20. 21. and 1 part of 22. and
part of verse 22.
thraldom: Notwithstanding which, God in the end will set them free, give them
a great and glorious victory, that the tyrant, who keeps them in subjection,
shall utterly be destroyed.

1. Wherein observe the time, verse. 17. I see it (that verse. 23. 24.
which I am to say) but not now: I behold it, but not near. How is that? He
spoke it plainer, verse. 14. I will tell thee what this people shall do to thy
people in the last days. By which notation of time, these things that were to
come so long after, are wont ordinarily to be expressed, Ezech. 38. 16. 8.
Esaias, 24. 22. This being the last and uttermost period, of whatsoever the
Scriptures do foretell; for hitherto and no further, reach the holy Oracles of
the Prophets, Reu. 10. 7. and 16. 17. So this Prophecy can not be drawn to
David's temporal kingdom.

2: Under the conquest of Moab and Edom, he points 46 Posit. Enemies subdued.
at that conversion, which shall be of the Gentiles, when the Jews returning
to seek Christ, shall subdue and bring under his yoke, all nations that do
oppose, as Esaias 11. 14. Joel: 3. 19. Obadia verse. 18. Zack. 10. 11. To wit
Moab, Edom, Amalek, Midian, noted by the Kenites, and by Kaine, the first
father of that kindred.

3. Those that shall thus prevail, and deal valiantly 7 Posit. General call.
are Israel, and of Jacob; or the people of the Jews, that very people out of
whom the star (Christ) should spring according to the flesh.

This Prophecy then, being of the Jews, of the destruction of their foes, and
that in the last days, note in the fourth place he speaks of bearing rule,
of a Scepter 18 Posit. Conquest.
or a kingdom, before which the enemies shall all fall, as it is said, Dan. 2.
44. It shall destroy and consume all other kingdoms, but it self shall stand
for ever. And again, Dan. 7. 9. I saw till the thrones were taken away. Which
evidently points at the glory and greatness of the Church that shall be among
them.

5. Is enterlaced their own sore bondage, which shall be in the mean time,
for the second part of the 22. verse, I read interrogatiuely, by an admiration,
and apostrophe, or turning of his speech unto the Israelites. How long shall
Ashur hold thee (o Eber, of whom he speaks immediately in the verses
following, and whose troops and squadrons were then before his eyes) captive?
Notwithstanding, all the glory and happiness that I now foretell, under the name
of Ashur (then, in Balaams time the sovereign Monarch, and the first who in
truth devoured Israel) comprehending the whole succession of Tyrants even to
this day, who consume his very bones, as Jeremy speaks, Ier. 50. 17.
Whereupon sixthly, he breaks forth into a lamentation, and yet triumphing in
the end.

Alas, who shall live, when the mighty God shall order this, that ships from
the coast of Cittim shall even afflict Ashur who afflicted Eber, and also he
shall for ever perish.

He that shall thus perish, is not Eber, or the Jew as 18 Posit. Conquest.
some Interpreters of great note would have it, (for that crosses the whole
scope of Balaams Prophecy) but it is the people that afflicted Eber, and
consequently, this is a prohecie of the kingdom of the Jews, who shall
master and overcome that people, which is enough for our purpose. But yet in
so difficult a piece of Scripture, wherein every man is to have his judgment
free, give me leave to do my best, to bring some further light unto it, first
I hold it for certain, that this is a Prophecy of the last condition of the
Jews, and of the affliction mentioned. Dan. 12. 1. Esaias 26. 20. The
lamentation in the Preface, and the destruction of that oppressing people in
the perclose or conclusion, seem to make that very evident, which being so, it
cannot be understood of the Greek or Roman army, much less restrained unto
Ashur properly called, whose glory fell in Senacharib so many years ago: But
in this 16 Posit. Sore distress.
place is specially meant of him, who last of all the tyrants shall so oppress
Gods heritage, that is to say, the Turk. Next by ships, that shall come from
the coast of Cittim or Cilicia, I understand the tribes transplanted into the
cities of the Medes, 2 King, 17. 6. who out of those northern climats, shall
make their passage to Iudaea for their return from the North is specially
promised: Ier. 3. 12. This aagreeth the better, because the word Isim, (which
is ships) signifies also men that dwell in far remote places, Esaias 23. 13.
Psalm. 72. 9.

Thirdly, the words which are commonly translated, shall afflict Ashur and
afflict Eber, I render thus, shall even afflict Ashur, who afflicted Heber.

This use of the particle van, (and) to take it for the relative, who you shall
find Esaias 49. 7. and els-where: and is an Hebraim, which Luke himself, whose
style is after the pure phrase of the most elegant Graecians, does not make
nice to follow, Act. 6. 6.

Lastly, the holy Ghost seems here to point at the two steps of the Turks
ruin.

The first, when tidings from the East, and from the North, shall trouble him,
Dan. 11. 44. which is his first declyning, that is meant in saying, They shall
afflict Ashur.

The other his utter and unrecoverable downfall; when planting his Tabernacle
in the glorious mount of holiness, he shall come to his end, and none shall help
him, Dan. 11. 45. This you have in the last words: And also that people (that
is to say, Ashur) shall for ever perish.

Deuteronomy. 32. 22. to verse 44.
THese words are a part of Moses song, and stand of three distinct branches.

The first foretells the sore calamity of the Jews, which they have felt now
2600. years, and shall come 4 Posit. Desolation. Verse. 22. to verse. 28.

thing it self, and by that which went before, and follows after, it may
well be thought, he means that high and supereminent sin, of refusing
Christ.

The third has the delivery of this people from the hand of their unmerciful
foe, wherein you may note.

is in hold, nor he that is abroad, and has escaped the enemies hand, strong or

Psalm 69.
IT is evident, that this Psalm is written of Christ, by the sentences, which
the story of the Gospel, Ioh. 2. 17. Matthew. 27. 34. Ioh. 19. 29. and the
Apostles, Acts 1. 19. Romans 11. 9. do apply unto him.

The first part of the Psalm, is a prayer in the person of Christ, oppressed
with that heavy burden of our sins, lying upon his shoulders. In the first 21,
verses.


The second, an imprecation against the nation of the Verse: 22, 23, 24 25, 26,
27, 28.
Jews, for crucifying the Lord of life.

The third is gratulatory, or of thanksgiving, in the behalf both of himself

humble ones among the Jews: that poor remnant, whom 3. Posit. Remnant.

the Gospel, and restoring their Cities and Country, to Verse: 32, 33.

Country.


So this third part contains a noble opposition to the former two.

Verse. 5. My foolishness, and my faults. That is, wherewith 26. Posit. Continue

Psalm 110.
THis Psalm does royally set forth the two offices of Christ his Kingdom and
Preisthood.

His Kingdom, by the powerful and great effects; Generally in subduing all
things to himself. More particularly Verse: 1.
first toward the Gentiles, unto whom the Gospel shall spread out of Tsion,
that is, from the Jews, then toward Verse: 2.

as Deuteronomy. 32. 43. Opposed there to the Gentiles by name: here to the same
Gentiles under the name of enemies, Thy Verse: 3.
people most free-hearted, in the day of thy troops: in the comely places of
holiness, from the womb of the morning, to thee (shall come) the dew of thy
youth. Wherein five things are given to understand.

1. Their prompt and ready obedience, who shall not 37. Posit. Cheerful
obedience.
pretend every light excuse, when they are bid to the marriage feast, as they
did in the days of Christ, Matthew. 22. But at the first hearing shall obey,
Esaias 66. 7, 8.

2. Their strength and power: For, in the day of thine armies, 18. Posit.
Conquest.
not only means the spiritual mustring, when they shall be called together,
by the Trumpet of the Word: but withal secretly does import their troops and
armies, that nobly and courageously shall fight for their lives, country, and
religion in the last days.

The 3. thing is, what a glorious Church God will set up 31. Posit. Glorious
Church.
among them: which he terms, comely places of holiness.

4. Their diligent and speedy turning to the Lord, when 37. Posit. Cheerful
obedience.
once they shall be summoned: As Esaias 66. 8. From the womb of the morning
(says our Psalmist) that is, as soon as the light of the Gospel shall but
begin to peep, whilst it is yet scarce break of day.

5 The innumerable company that shall be called, and 38. Posit. Multiplication
of believers.
flock to the Lords Assemblies, as the drops of dew that fall from heaven in
the morning.

By all which appears, that this is not to be accomplished till their last
conversion. And the second and third verse have the very same dependence that
you find Esaias 2. 2, 3, 4, 5. Mica 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

The Priesthood is set out with great glory verse. 4. from the which he
resorteth again to the power of Christ's kingdom, in the three verses
following. Which may be taken generally of all enemies whatsoever, and
wheresoever opposing against Christ. Neither is there I confess any necessity
to stretch them further. Yet when I consider all the circumstances and the
weight of every word, day of his wrath, dashing to pieces of Kings, judging the
Heathen, filling the places with dead carcases, dashing in pieces the head, 18.
Posit. Conquest.
I am drawn to believe that hereby is meant the destruction of some one grand
enemy that shall dominere over Gods people, and be subdued in the last days
by the believing Jews: whereupon Christ is said to lift up his head in
victory and in triumph. And hereunto the very order of the Psalm may lead us,
that speaks of these things in time after the Jews conversion. So does the
phrase of breaking of the head. Which as it is elegantly used to note a
thorough conquest, so secretly it seems to point at the Grand Signior
himself. And (erets rabba) which we translate great Countries, the Psalmist
takes up of purpose, closely and covertly under an ambiguous kind of speech,
to intimate the Land of Rabba, the chief City of the Ammonites, which David
conquered, 2 Samuel 12. thereby understanding these enemies of Gods people Gog
and Magog, as they are else where under the name of Moab and Edom, the
Ammonites cousin germans.

Such doubtful speeches that carry a current and clear meaning, and yet have
an other thing infolded, which time and event of the Prophecies will reveal,
the ancient Prophets delighted to use. As that good Father Jacob, Genesis 48. 22.
I give thee one portion above thy brethren, one hill or piece of ground more
then they. But the word is Sechem, or City of the Sechemites, which was the
flower of the portion assigned to the house of Joseph. So Esaias 11. 1. A graffe
shall grow out of the roots of Ishai. Netser, which in Hebrew is a graffe,
closely notes a Nazaraean, or one borne in Nazareth.

Cantic. 8. 10. I being a wall, and my breasts towers, then shall I be in his
eyes as one that finds peace.
Verse. 8. First, Solomon foreseeing in spirit the calling of the Gentiles, does
in the person of the Church consult with 7 Posit. General call.
Christ of some good course to be taken, for the furtherance of their Faith: by
her in helping and administering, by him in giving an increase and blessing.

Verse 9. Christ and she both do signify when those days do come, how
graciously they mean to deal.

Whereupon the Church in this third verse professes she is so joyful of her
younger sisters good, that she her self the Church of the Jews will account
it her perfection, 6. Posit. Call in the last days.
to grow at the last into one and the same body as a principal and most
glorious part of that spiritual building. This therefore is an evident
prophecy of the Jews conversion in the end of the world.

Esaias, Chapters 2. 3. 4.
The four first verses of the second chapter are of the spreading of the
Gospel out of Tsion to the Gentiles. Whereupon he provoke the Jews to a
holy emulation. Verse: 5.

most wonderful desolation, anarchie and confusion brought upon them: yet will
God have mercy, and set up a glorious Church among them, in that very day when
the period of their desolation is at an end: that you may know what is the
desolation which before he spoke of, even that the end whereof is the beginning
of their greatness. 31 Posit. Glorious Church.


Esaias, Chapter 6. 9. etc. to the end of the Chapter. Verse 2.

The hardening of the peoples heart was fulfilled upon Verse 9. and 10.
Christ's preaching of the Gospel, and is meant of those times; for thither the
Evangelist does refer it, Ioh. 12 41. These things said Esaias when he saw
his (Christ's) glory, and spoke of him. Wherefore you must take heed of applying
this to the Babylonian, or any other captivity that went before. But not to
contend in that, certain it is that this hardness (at what time soever you
assign the beginning) not only endured to the Apostles times, Act 28. 25. 26.
but yet now endures and shall endure till the fullness of the Gentiles become
in, Romans 11. 25.

So the fearful desolation here spoken of, comprehends 4 Posit. Desolation.
all that time: and therefore the thirteenth verse, an evident prophecy of
their conversion: which I thus read. Verse: 11. and 12.
But yet there shall be in it a tenth part, which again shall be eaten 7.
Posit. General call.
up: nevertheless, as an Elm and as an Oak, which when they are rammed in,
the fastening is in them; so the holy seed is the fastening thereof, that is, of
that tenth part.

By the tenth part is meant a small remnant, through the election of Grace that
shall be left in the midst of this dereliction, 3. Posit. Remnant.
Esaias 24. 13. and 65. 8. which again shall be eaten 16 Posit. Sore desires.
up. He means that when once they begin to make head, embracing Christ, and
returning toward their own country, Gog and Magog shall afflict them most
extremely, Esaias 26. 20. Dan. 12. 1. But as hard and durable trees that are
rammed into the ground on both sides of a Cawsey, do keep the earth fast from
falling down: so the holy seed shall fasten them. By holy Seed I understand
not the poor remnant of the godly among them; for whose sake God will spare
the rest; for the holy seed is said here to be the stay of that remnant or
tenth part, and it were improper to make the remnant the stay of the remnant:
he means therefore the blessed seed, or seed of the woman, Christ Jesus, who
shall then after a wonderful manner put life and vigor into his people,
holding them up in the midst of that grievous conflict: from whence a
general doctrine is easy to be gathered for the comfort of all Gods people.

To conclude, I parallel this place in all points with Dan. 12. 1. That Michael
there spoken of, so named to note his Deity, is this blessed seed, according to
the flesh or humane nature.

Esaias, Chap. 11. 1. 12, etc. to the end of the 12. chapter.

xij. chapter is an Appendix unto this) has a further and a more noble comfort,

6. The eternity of Gods decree, fore-appointing him to this punishment. And
as the Judgment should be marvelous and singular, so he bestows a word upon
him, never elsewhere used in such an argument. As he does Dan. 11. 45. (the
beginning of the 33 verse.)

7. There is a kind of distribution. The King himself, 18 Posit. Conquest.
the grand Signior as well as the rest of the people shall fall in this
destruction. (in the second part of the verse.)

8. Lastly, is expressed the heaviness of the Judgment. In the end of the 33
verse.
The 31 chapter, which is added as a conclusion, shortly comprehends the
effect of the former chapter: wherein after threatening of the Jews, and those

be gathered, what are the times that this desolation does point unto.

Esaias chap. 33. 34. and 35.
These three chapters are all of one argument. The 18. verse, which the Apostle
1 Cor. 1. 10. applies to the times of the Gospel, is a key to open the sense
and understanding of them.

First, you have the general proposition. He that makes such waste and
havoc of Gods people, the Jews, 18. Posit. Conquest.
when the period which God has set to his tyrannic, is run out, shall
himself be brought unto confusion. verse. 1. wherefore to this grand enemy all
the rest of the prophecy has respect.

defense for 18. Posit. Conquest.
them all and every one, verse. 2. and a discomfit to their foes, both
scattering their persons, verse 3. and enriching his people with their spoils.
verse. 4.

After which follows a branching of the proposition in two divided members.
The judgment which God will execute for the revenge of his Church, verse. 5.
and 18 Posit. Conquest.
the stabilitie of the Jewish Synagogue (converted to 42. Posit. Stabilitie of
the Church.
Christ) thorough faith and the fear of God. (verse. 6.)

The former comprehends the Jews extremities, and Gods setting of them free.

Their extremities:

1. No peace to be had at their enemies hands, what equal conditions soever
they do propound. Which shall 16. Posit. Sore distress.
make even the valiantest among them (him whose heart is as the heart of a
Lion) to weep bitterly, (verse. 7.) and all travailing to and fro to cease,
(verse. 8.)

2. The country shall lie all waste, verse. 9. for though I do not deny but
the Prophet might frame the mould of his speech by the things that fell out
when Senacharib so dominierd over Gods heritage: yet I hold this to be a
prophecy not an history, and to respect that sore time of affliction Dan. 12.
1. for the auerting whereof it cannot be thought but the Jews will seek all
means that may be of peace and quietness, which the proud Turk will scorn
and set at naught, as that Tyrant did, to bring judgment upon his own head.

Gods wonderful deliverance of his people and the setting 18. Posit. Conquest.
of them free, ruining their foes, is verse. 10. 11, 12.

In the second part, whereunto he moves attention, by proclaiming the
excellency of the work, (verse. 13.) are all the memorable things, whereof
every where in the Scripture promises are made unto the Jews, to wit, their
first call, the overthrow of their enemy, and the glorious Church that shall
be set up among them.

In their call: 7. Posit. General call.


First, by reason of a Prolepsis or Objection of certain hypocrites, under the
mask of counterfeit humility, coloring their want of Faith, and believing of
Gods promises (for all shall not receive the grace offered) (verse. 14.) he 9
Posit. Refractaries.
describes the badge and marks of the persons whom God will vouchsafe to call
(verse. 15.)

Secondly, he sets down the promises themselves, which are of six sorts.

1. Their stabilitie. (verse. 16.) 42 Posit. Stabilitie of the Church.


2. The beauty of Christ dwelling among them. (verse 17.)

3. The large spread of the Gospel. Their eyes (says 32 Posit. Churches beauty

All Nations embracing Christ.
of the same faith and subject to them. (second part of verse. 17.)

4. Safety and security, void of all fear. Well may they think upon the
dangers past, and call them to mind, 46 Posit. Enemies possessed.
as ministering matter enough to scorn such attempts, the counsels, purses, and
forces of their enemies; but never 41 Posit. Safety of the Church.
shall they need to stand in fear of such or the like any more. (verse. 18,
19.)

5. The excellency of the Church (verse. 20.) by reason of Christ's dwelling
there. (verse. 21, 22.)

6 The fruit and benefit that shall come to every one, even the seeliest and
meanest. (verse. 23, 24.)

The ruin and overthrow of their enemies (which comes in the second place)
is Chap. 34. In it you have a 18 Posit. Conquest.
terrible and fearful judgment, both against their persons (verse. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.) and the Land it self for their sake. (verse. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15.) All confirmed from the most certain and inviolable decree of God the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (verse. 16, 17.)

In the third place Chap. 35. is declared the excellency of Christ's kingdom,
that shall then be set up among the Jews. Wherein these six things are
reckoned up.

1. The making of all things new both the senseless creatures, (verse. 1, 2.)
and men, (verse. 3, 4, 5. and 1. part of verse. 6.) uttered by hyperbolicall and
excessive speeches. 36 Posit. Spiritual grases.


The efficient cause whereof is the Spirit of God abundantly shed upon them.

2. The Church of the Jews repair toward her own home and former seats.

3. The sanctity of the Church so returning and making homewards. (2 part of
verse. 8.) 41 Posit. Safety of the Church.

verse. 10.) 40 Posit. Joy.


Esaias 41. 15. to the end of the Chapter.
THe 40th Chapter propounds comfort thorough the promises of God in Christ to
his people the Jews, after those long and tedious calamities which they had
endured in the Babylonian captivity, and the hard times that followed after.
(verse. 1, 2.)

The parts of it are,

1. The ministry of John Baptist a Cryar to prepare his way. (verse. 3, 4, 5.)

2. The Apostolical ministry of all the Preachers of the Gospel, teaching
repentance (verse. 6, 7, 8.) and faith in Christ. (verse. 9.)

3. The general administration of Christ's kingdom, subduing rebels, (verse.
10.) and most kindly entreating his. (verse. 11.)

4. Evangelical promises particular to the seed of Jacob, which because they
are of a high and marvelous nature, first he lays the ground of them, by the
consideration of the nature of God the Creator. (verse. 12. to the end of the
Chap.) and of his special favors to Abraham and all the Church. (Chap. 41. to
the 15. verse.)

Secondly, he comes to the promises themselves, being of two sorts.

1. The power of God in their weakness to throw down all that shall oppose.
(verse. 15, 16.) 18 Posit. Conquest.


2. The singular graces of his regenerating and sanctifying 36 Posit.
Spiritual graces.
Spirit which he will bestow. (verse. 17, 18, 19, 20.)

Thirdly, he amplifieth and confirms the same by three arguments.

One is by opposing to Idols that are able to do nothing (verse. 21, 22, 23,
24.) the Church of the Jews, that making head to repair to their own
country shall trample the 12 Posit. Repair toward their Country.
greatest Potentates under feet. Where naming the North and East, he shows
from what quarters the first Jews are to come that shall terrify the Turkish
forces, as Dau. 18 Posit. Conquest.
11. 44. (verse. 25.) 10 Posit. First converted.


A second argument is by opposing to the same Idols, Christ, the wisdom of
God and the power of God, in whom God alone works all that has been said,
after his own pleasure. (verse. 26, 27.)

The third argument is by removing all other means whatsoever. (verse. 28, 29.)

Read verse 27. thus. A prime man unto Tsion, in whom Behold, behold these
things, and to Jerusalem a publisher of glad tidings, will I give. By [prime
man] he means CHRIST the Head of the Church.
Esaias, chap. 42.
THe 42th chapter first describes the gracious and sweet carriage of Christ
(verse. 1, 2, 3, 4.) in the office enjoined him or his Father, (verse. 5, 6, 7.)
being one God with the Father, (verse. 8) and the only Prophet that from the
beginning has revealed to the Church whatsoever is or shall be. (verse. 9.)

Secondly, all nations of the world are hereupon invited to celebrate Gods
praises, (verse. 10, 11, 12.) the Prophet reciting what wonderful works God
will do in their behalf. (verse. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) Wherefore this second
part belongs to the calling of the Gentiles.

The third part touches the Jews. It expresses first the hardness of their
heart and unbelief, [vers. 18, 19, 20.] 2 Posit. Reiection.
(notwithstanding all the mercy they were formerly vouchsafed, God having loved
them and taken delight in them, given his law unto them, and done most great
and glorious things for their sakes) (verse. 21.) which unbelief of theirs
shall draw upon their head most 4. Posit. Desolation.
heavy indgements. (verse. 22, 23, 24, 25.) Secondly, their conversion and
turning unto God, (chap. 43. 1.) whereupon 5. Posit. Call.
follows Gods wonderful care over them in four steps or degrees.

1. Protection, in the midst of their greatest dangers. (verse. 2.)

2. Bringing of other nations under their dominion. 45. Posit. Nations
honoring of them.
(verse. 3. 4.)

3. The gathering of them out of all quarters, whether they were dispersed,
East, West, North, and South. (ver. 5. 6) 23. Posit. Dwelling in their country.


4. The great and glorious graces which he will royally enrich them with,
(verse. 7.) opposed to their former infidelity. 36. Posit. Spiritual graces
(verse. 8.)

All which things being to come so long after, and whereof all the world is not
able before hand to signify any one, (verse. 9.) are verified by the most
sacred testimony of God the Father in his Son. (verse. 10. 11. 12. 13.)

Read thus, Verse 21. The Lord delighted in him for his righteousness sake:
he magnified him by the Law, he made him honorable. Verse. 22. But he is a
people robbed and spoiled in snaring all the young men of them, etc. (That is,
the enemies lead the gallantest of them Captives).
Read thus, Verse. 4. (the end of the verse.) Therefore will I subject men unto
thee, and people to thy desire. Verse 7. Every one that is called by my name:
Whom I have created for my glory. I will form him, (or frame him anew by the
spirit of Regeneration) yea I will make him: (That is to say, glorify him, as
the word make is often taken.)
Esaias Chapter 43. verse. 14. to the 6. verse of the 44. chapter (which because
of the Argument some make a chapter by it self, but I follow in the verses the
received distinction.)
IN this Text you have the sum of all that follows, to the end of the book.
The two first verses (verse. 14. 15) speak of the return of the Jews out of
the Captivity of Babell, and are explicated in the 44. 45, 46. 47. and 48,
chapters. Therest of the chapter, from the 16. verse to the 21. verse of the
44. chapter, is all of Evangelical promises to that people, explicated in the
49. and the chapters following. The promises in this chapter are;

1. Gods making of a path in the Sea, meaning (as I conceive) the drying up
that shall be of the River Euphrates, 13 Posit. Euphrates dry.
for the people to pass unto their country. (verse. 16.)

2. The ruin and overthrow of the mighty foe that 18. Posit. Conquest.
shall be adverse unto them, the Turk and his whole Army. (verse. 17.)

3. Which for the greatness and nouelty of the work may worthily obscure and
blot out the memory of former acts: (verse. 18. and the first part of the 19.)
the watering of the dry and barren Desert with the dew of his grace, (the
second 5 Posit. Call.
part of verse. 19. and verse. 20.) that is, the framing and fashioning of this
people (so long cast off) anew to the honor and praise of God, (verse. 21.)
whose gracious and merciful dealing in this behalf is garnished and set forth
two manner of ways.

1. Notwithstanding they served not the true God (for God is not worshipped but
in Christ) (verse. 22. 23. 24) yet he only for himself, that is for his
goodness sake, will have mercy on them. (verse. 25.)

2. (Which their own Consciences cannot but accuse them of) (verse. 26.) though
for their transgressions, the 2 Posit. Reiection.
transgressions of their forefathers, and of their chief principal persons
that should be the Interpreters of the Will of God among them, (verse. 27.) he
had worthily cast them 4. Posit. Desolation.
off, and exposed them to reproach: (verse. 28.) yet he will perform most large
and ample promises, in pouring abundantly 36. Posit. Spiritual Graces.
upon them, the graces of his Spirit. (chap. 44. verse. 1. 2. 3. 4.)

4. A fourth and last promise is, the joining of other 44. Posit. All Nations
embracing Christ.
Nations unto them, in the socity of the Gospel: whereby is intimated the full
coming in of the Gentiles. (ver. 5.)

Esaias, Chapter 49.
IT describes the calling of Christ from all eternity to the Office of
Mediation, (verse. 1. 2.) and the benefit that shall thereby redound to others;
both the offer of salvation to the Jews (verse. 3.) and upon their refusal
(verse. 4. 5) the calling of the Gentiles. (verse. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13.)
And lastly, that the Jews themselves after a long desolation, (verse. 14.)
shall be thought upon: (verse. 15.) wherefore 4. Posit. Desolation.
touching the Jews, these things are delivered in 5 Posit. Call.
Order.

1. Gods care and affection to them. (1. part of verse. 16.)

2. Their conversion and building up. (2. part of verse 12. Posit. Repayr

3. The repair to their old seats. (1. part of verse 18.)

4. The surpassing glory and excellency of their Church. 31. Posit. Glorious
Church.
2. part of verse. 18.)

5. The multitudes that shall ioyn themselves to Christ. 38. Posit. Multitude
of Believers.
(verse. 19. 20. 21.

6. Their continual concourse from out of the most remote parts. (verse. 22.)

7. The honor which the Nations shall do unto them. (verse. 23.) 45. Posit.
Nations honoring them.


8. The ruin and destruction of the mighty Tyrant, (who can that be but the
Turk?) that now holds them 18. Posit. Conquest.

Esaias, Chapter 50. and 51.
THe parts of this Prophecy are three.

In the first, Christ shows the Jews divorce, and Gods casting of them off,
to be most just, and their own 2. Posit. Reiection.
fault in refusing him. (verse. 1.) 1. Posit. Refusing Christ.


In the second, he wondreth that his own people should set him so light, (1.
part of verse. 2.) seeing he is as able as ever he was to help them, (2 part
of verse. 2. and verse 3.) and as ready, being furnished of his Father with all
needful graces, fullness of the spirit, and powerful doctrine: (verse. 4.)
obedience, (verse. 5.) patience, (verse. 6.) and constancy, (verse. 7.) and last
his cause being so good and just, (verse. 8. 9.)

In the third part he turns his speech to the Jews. wherein;

1. He quickneth the poor remnant, such among them them as should receive
Christ (verse. 10.) 3. Posit. Remnant.


2. He pronounces against those that refuse Christ, sentence of obduration
from God. (verse. 11.) 2. Posit. Reiection.


3. By the example of his mercies to Abraham and Sara, from whom they were
descended, (chap. 51. verse. 1. 2.) he 5. Posit. Call.

Church.
souls, (1. part of verse. 3.) which conversion is set out by the excellency
and happiness of it, (2. part of verse. 3.) and in that it shall draw with it
the full coming in of the Gentiles. 44 Posit. All nations embracing Christ.
(verse. 4. 5.)

4. He promises the destruction of their enemies, who 18. Posit. Conquest.
being so powerful and mighty, and so sharp set against them, he uses many
arguments to hearten and encourage the Jews, that they should not be afraid.

First Argument, God will dissolve heaven and earth, (verse. 6.) Why then should
they fear? (verse. 7.) for he can much more make the enemies of the Church to
melt before his face. (verse. 8.)

Second Argument, is from the power of God in himself, and from his own
mighty and outstretched arm. (1. part of verse. 9.)

Third Argument from former examples. His judgments upon Pharaoh and the Land
of Egypt, (2. part of verse. 9.) and the drying up of the red Sea for the people
to pass. (verse 10) The like whereof he will do for the redemption of the
Jews, when they shall return to Tsion. 13 Posit. Euphrates dry.
(verse. 11.)

Fourth Argument from the nature of God our Comforter. (verse. 12.)

Fifth Argument from his mighty and powerful works, who made heaven and
earth, (1. part of verse. 13.) bridleth the fury of the wicked, that their
hands are able to do nothing, (2. part of verse. 13. and verse. 14.) and
stilleth the raging Sea. (verse. 15.)

Sixth Argument from his word and covenant with this people. (verse. 16.)

Seventh Argument by comparing the former tyrannizing of their enemies, (verse.
17. 18. 19. 20.) with Gods gracious deliverance of them. (verse. 21. 22. 23.)

Esaias, Chapter 52. to the 13. verse.
THis Chapter (if it be a several Sermon of it self, and not a part of the
former) is all in promises to the people of the Jews.

First is the freeing of them from the tyranny of their enemies: 18. Posit.

to wit, Gog and Magog, (verse. 1. 2. 3.) which is amplified by setting before
them the like examples of Gods former mercies. The Egyptians, says he,
whether the people went down to soiourne, causelessly oppressed them, and I set
them free. So if the Assyrians, that is to say, the Babilonians. (verse. 4.) The
like will I do to these oppressors. (verse. 5.)

The second promise is, the communication of the 5. Posit. Call.

(verse. 6.)

Thirdly, the joy and cheerfulness of the Church of the 37. Posit. Cheerful

Jews receiving the Gospel of peace, the Gospel of the Kingdom. (verse. 7.
8. 9.)

Fourthly, the large spread of the Gospel throughout the world. (verse. 10.) 44
Posit. All Nations embracing Christ.


Fifthly, the sanctity of the new Jerusalem. (verse. 11.)

Sixthly, their safety and security through Gods protection, in a more glorious
sort then when they came out of Egypt. 33. Posit. Sanctity.
(verse. 12.) 41. Posit. Safety of the Church.


Esaias, Chapter 54.
THE barren one whom the Prophet addresseth his speech unto, is the Church of
the Jews in their desolation. 4. Posit. Desolation.
For first, the fourth verse speaks of her widdowhead, as of one that once
had been a Church, but now divorced, as chap. 50. 1 More plainly in the sixth
verse she is termed a wife forsaken, and the wife of the youth; none of which
agree either to the Church of the Gentiles, or the Catholic Church: secondly,
in the 11. verse she is said to be humbled, tossed, not comforted: how fitting
is that to their estate? Thirdly, the glorious things verse. 11. 12. etc. are
never spoken, but of their Church renewed. But how then does the Apostle Gal. 4.
26. 27. Make us Gentiles children of this Church, and calls the same
Jerusalem above? Rightly is she called Jerusalem above, the spiritual and
heavenly Jerusalem, cast into a new mould, and framed and fashioned from above
to embrace Christ, and to seek righteousness, peace, and reconciliation
through him alone, whose children are free: by opposition to thee then
Jerusalem, that sought righteousness and life by the Law, and therefore
engendered children unto bondage And this new Jerusalem is indeed the mother of
us all. Why? for it is the same very Church, and no other, polished, fined, and
wonderfully adorned, which was in the time of the Apostles, when the Law that
is the doctrine of Jesus Christ, which is the Gospel, came out of Sion, and
the Word of the Lord out of Jerusalem, That whosoever will be saved, must
acknowledge himself a child of this Mother, Reuelat. 22. 22.

This doubt cleared, the rest of the chapter has no difficulty: there be in
it promises of three kinds.

1. Fruitfulness of the Church. (verse. 1. 2. 3.) 38. Posit. Multitude of
belieuers.


2. Gods Covenant with them of remission of sins, (verse. 4.) reconciliation,
(verse. 5. 6.) and life everlasting. (verse. 7. 8. 9. 10.) 35. Posit. Covenant.


3. The surpassing glory of their Church for exceeding beauty, (verse. 11. 12.)
Excellency of knowledge, (1. part of 32. Posit. Churches beauty
13. verse.) Abundance of peace, (2. part of verse 13.) Security, 36 Posit.
Spiritual grace.
(verse. 14.) Safety. (verse. 15. 16. 17.) 39. Posit. Prosperity.


Esaias, Chapter 59 verse 16. to the end of the 60. chapter. 41. Posit. Safety.

AFfter declaration of the peoples hypocrisy, and other sins which brought
upon them so many calamities; he comes now to cheer up their heart with the
promises of the Gospel: setting forth,

1. The power of Christ's kingdom for the salvation of his children, (verse.
16.) and to revenge all disobedience, (verse. 17. and 1. part. of 18.)

2. The calling of the Gentiles. (2. part of verse. 18. and 19.)

3. The conversion of the Jews, that they together with the believing
Gentiles, embracing the Gospel, all Israel 5 Posit. Call.
may be saved: for so Paul, Romans 11. 26. expounds this 44. Posit. All nations

All which things are shut up with a most sure groundworke, 35. Posit. Covenant.
the faithful Covenant of God which he has made with his Church to dwell
among them for ever, by his Word, and the power of his Spirit. (verse. 21.)

4. The glorious Church that shall be among them, 31. Posit. Glorious Church.
(chap. 60. verse. 1. 2.)

5. The Gospel flowing thence to all other places. 44. Posit. All nations
embracing Christ.
(verse. 3.)

6. The nations honoring of them with their wealth 45. Posit. Nations
honoring of them.
and substance. (verse. 7. to the 18.)

7. Their safety and protection from danger. (verse. 18.)

8. Their happiness. (verse. 19. 20.) 41. Posit. Safety of the Church.


9. They shall inherit the land for ever. (verse. 21.)

10. Their increase, both for multitude and strength. 39. Posit. Prosperity.
(verse 22.)

Chapter 61. and 62. and 63. and 64. and 65. 26. Posit. Continue for ever.

THe Sermon of these five chapters after the foundation 28 Posit. Country
populous.
laid in the calling and annointment of Christ unto his office of teaching and
comforting Gods people, (chap. 61. verse. 1. 2. first part of verse. 3.) is
wholly spent in the fruit and benefit that thence shall redound to the Jews.
It stands of two parts. First is a particular enumeration of the favors that
God will bestow upon them: all which may be reduced to two heads. Blessings
upon themselves, and the destruction of their capital enemy.

The blessings upon themselves are these that follow:

1. The renewing of them in holiness and righteousness, 5. Posit. Call.
that is to say, their conversion. (2. part of verse. 3.)

2. The restoring of the fruitfulness of their Country, 27. Posit.
Fruitfulness of the land.
that so long lay waste and desolate. (verse. 4.)

3. There shall be in them a sovereignty over other Nations: whom their arm
and power shall master, and bring 46 Posit. Enemies possessed.
to yield obedience to Christ and his Gospel, (verse. 5. As Esaias 14. 2. 45.
Posit Nations honoring them.


4. The wealth of other Churches shall be to do them service. (verse. 6.)

5. Their former double (that is to say exceeding great) 40 Posit. Glorious
Church.
reproach, shall be turned into double joy and gladness (v. 7) Read Verse 7.
thus. Instead of your double shame, and the confusion which they (the enemies
of the Church) with shouting proclaimed to be their portion, therefore in their
own land they shall inherit double, etc.

6. An everlasting covenant with this people to direct 35 Posit. Covenant.
them in all integrity. (verse. 8.)

7. The lively marks and prints of Gods blessing upon them, which shall make
them famous among all nations. 45 Posit. Nations honoring them.
(verse. 9.)

8. The glory of their Church. (verse. 10, 11. chap. 62. verse. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.)
for which the Lords remembrancers are 31 Posit. Glorious church
willed continually to make suite unto him. (verse. 6, 7.)

9. Their security from foreine enemies. (verse. 8, 9.)

10. The return unto their country, all lets removed that may hinder it.
(verse. 10.)

11. Gods redeeming and setting of them free. (verse. 11, 12.)

The destruction of their capital enemy, (undoubtedly he means the Turk)
signified by Edom, and attributed 18 Posit. Conquest.
to Christ Jesus, (for it is the work of God himself) (chap. 63. verse. 1.) is
amplified two ways.

1. That there was not any enemy so strong that could or durst withstand him.
Read Verse 3. And of the people not a man could stand with me.
(verse. 2, 3.)

2. That he did it alone without any help. (verse. 4, 5, 6, 7.) 19 Posit. Gods
fighting.


The second part of the Sermon is the Churches praising of God for this his
constant kindness, notwithstanding their most extreme ingratitude: (verse. 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.) and a suite and request which thereupon they make to
Christ, with his answer to it.

The suite, that in regard of his covenant and former kindnesses both promised
and performed, (verse. 15, 16, 17.) and the insufferable insolency of Gods
enemies and theirs, (verse. 18, 19.) he would from heaven powerfully show forth
his wrath to the dismaying of his foes Read Verse 3. In doing terrible things
which we looked not for: o that thou would come down, that the mountains
might flow etc.
(verse. 1, 2, 3. 18 Posit. Conquest.
Chapt. 64.) and good of the Church, in the glorious promulgation of the
Gospel through Christ; (verse. 4.) for so does Paul 1 Cor. 2. 9. expound this
place of the wisdom of God revealed in the Gospel, not of the heavenly glory.
This suite they confirm and give assurance to their souls of the obtaining of
it, by considering the mercy of God toward repentant sinners, desirous to
walk in a new course of righteousness, (1. part of verse. 5.) and the
profession of their own true repentance; (2 part of verse. 5. and verse. 6, 7.)
whereupon they resort again to the sum of their former petition. (verse. 8,
9, 10, 11, 12.)

Christ's answer (Chapt. 65.) sets forth

1. The calling of the Gentiles. (verse. 1.)

2. The obduration of the Jews. (verse. 2, 3, 4, 5.) Both these points we
learn from Paul's opposition of this text, 2 Posit. Reiection.
Romans 10. 21.

3. Gods just punishment upon them for it, meaning the casting of them off, and
their long desolation. 4 Posit. Desolation.

Esaias chap. 66.
IN this Chapter, which is as it were the last farewell that Christ takes of
the old synagogue, he leaves them three remembrances.

First, an instruction how the Jewish Church should demean themselves in his
worship; who delights not in the Temple-obseruances but in spiritual
service. (verse. 1, 2, 3.)

Secondly, what heavy judgments shall come upon 4 Posit. Desolation.
the Jews for sticking obstinately and hypocritically to the legal rites.
(verse. 4)

Thirdly, the state and constitution of the Church, which shall be set up
among them: containing these things.

1. The restoring of them; which shall be to the exceeding joy of his children
and confusion of those hypocrites. 31 Posit. Glorious church

2. The terror and affright unto their foes, upon the report of their repairing

same, they saw evident before their eyes, and yet justified her by their
practice: does now will the Prophet to publish the promise of reconciliation

These things thus laid down; now he amplifieth the fame by a double argument:
each in the nature of a prolepsis or objection.

1. It is true, great afflictions shall befall the faithful, even as soon as

Howbeit the success shall be prosperous and happy, children shall be borne to
the Church every day, even out of the enemies country, that is, pulled out of
the kingdom of Sin and Satan. (verse. 16, 17.)

2. But much greater shall the lamentation be in the last days, when Ephraim,
that is, the Israelites, in the sense 8 Posit. X. Tribes.
of their many miseries, and conscience of their sins, the cause of it, shall
mourn bitterly, and with tears of vnseined repentance, seek unto the Lord.

by such silly means as they. Why (says he) should thou delay repentance,
and be afraid to join thy self unto me; seeing for thee, and by thee, the
Lord will work a strange and wonderful work. A woman, the feeble nation of
the Jews, shall compass, that is, besiege and bring into straights and

amplifications. (verse. 31, 32, 33, 34.)

Now all these promises so great and excellent, he does confirm by two most
noble comparisons.

1. They are as certain as the ordinance of the Sun, the Moon, the Stars,
and the tides of the Sea. (verse. 35, 36.)

2 It is as impossible they should fail, as it is impossible to measure the
heavens, or to search the foundations of the earth. (verse. 37.)

The 34 and the last, the perpetual continuance of this their flourishing and
happy estate. (2 part of verse. 40.) 26 Posit. Continue for ever.


Jeremy, Chap. 33.
IN this Chapter are many excellent promises, whereunto a preparation is first
made, (verse. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) and then the promises themselves laid down: 5
Posit. Call.


Which are; 39 Posit. Prosperity.


1. The restoring of them. (1. part of verse. 6.)

2. Abundance of Gods blessings. (2 part of verse. 6.) 8 Posit. X. Tribes.

10. The flourishing state of the Church, in a perpetual 32. Posit. Churches

Lastly, the certainty of these two promises that went last before, is verified
much by the same arguments that were used to that purpose, Ierem. 32. (verse.
19. to the end of the chapter.)

Ezechiel 16.
THis Chapter does maruellously fet forth the exceeding mercy and goodness of
God in his first favors unto the Jews, vouchsafing to receive them into the
spiritual marriage bed (in the first 14. verses.) and how many ways they
dealt most perfidiously and falsely with him (from thence to the 52. verse) for
the which he threatens utterly to cast them off, (verse. 52. to verse 59.)
recompencing unto them according to their ways; for as they made no reckoning
of the curse annexed to the transgression of the Law, and brake the Covenant
made with God: so would he break his Covenant made with them: (verse. 59.) yet
(such is the riches of his mercy) to their posterity, the generation that
should come after, a remnant according to election of grace, he would extend
grace and favor. And so he falls to the sweet promises of the Gospel:
wherein you have,

1. The fundamental cause and ground of all the rest, Gods free gracious and
everlasting covenant. (verse. 60.)

2. The means, their serious and true Repentance. (1. part of verse. 61.) 5

5. The instrument or hand of the soul to lay hold upon 36 Posit. Spiritual

the Covenant, is Faith, which stands in the true and effectual knowledge of
God, and wherewith they shall plentifully be endued, (verse. 62.)

6. The end of all is, that being ashamed and confounded in themselves, they
may embrace the only expiation which is to be had in the blood of Christ.
(verse. 63.)

handled in order.

THe consideration of the profane wickedness of the Prince of Israel, (verse.
25.) kindles the Prophets zeal to meditate both of the fall of that polluted
principality, and of a holy and firm principality that shall be set up in and
through Christ; for these are the two parts of this Prophecy. The fall of that
principality, or the 4. Posit. Desolation.
utter ruin and desolation of the whole land of Iudaea, has three steps or
parts.

1. The kindome shall be taken from them: no Crown, no Diadem there. (1. part

2. The Commonwealth shall not be as now it is. All shall be turned vpside
down. (2. part of verse 26.) Read Verse 26. the latter part of it, thus. That
which is low, exalt: and that which is high, bring down. Just the same that

unworthy. (verse. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 26 Posit. Continue for ever

Ezechiell, Chapter 37.
ALl from hence to the end of the book, is excellently to this purpose: It
has four steps or degrees. The first step is the jews first conversion,
which the Apostle 5 Posit. Call.
calls Life from the dead, Romans 11. 15. a kind of resurrection, and here is
set forth by alluding thereunto (in the first 14 verses.) The second step in a
further progress of their conversion, under a parable or similitude of two
sticks, (verse. 15. 16. 17.) comprehends many noble benefits; the application
whereof has,

1. The conversion of the X. Tribes as well as Judah, (verse. 18. and 1. part of
verse. 19.) 8. Posit. Ten Tribes.


2. The uniting of them both into one. (2. part of verse 19.) 26 Posit. One
kingdom.


3. The bringing of them to their own country from 23. Posit. Dwelling in
their country.
all the places where they were scattered. (verse. 20. 21.)

4. Their making of one entire kingdom. (verse. 22.)

5. The Covenant of God with them of peace and reconciliation, 29. Posit. One
Kingdom.
(verse. 23.) through Christ. (1. part of ver. 24.) 35. Posit. Covenant.


6. The sanctifying of them to walk in his obedience. (2. part of verse. 24.)

7. The inhabiting in their country for ever. (verse. 25.) 26 Posit. Continue
for ever.


8. The perpetuity of Gods Covenant, (verse. 26.) and worship among them. (verse.
27. 28.)

The third step or degree, is the destruction of their 43. Posit. Perpetuity.
enemies in the 38. and 39. chapters. Wherefore;

1. The enemies are reckoned up, the Grand enemy is 18. Posit. Conquest.
Gog. out of the Land of Magog, Prince and head of Meshech and Tuball, (chap.
38. verse. 1. 2 3.) that is to say, the Turk; for Magog is the Scythian Nation,
from whom came the Turks, Lords of Meshech and Tuball, that is, of Capadocia,
and lberia, when they first began to reign, but whom now Asia the less, Syria,
Mesopotamia, A rabia, Iudaea, Palestina, Egypt, the Isles Greece, Macedonia,
Thrace, etc. do obey; with him are multitudes of Princes his associates.
(verse. 4. 5. 6.)

2. Their preparation to come in the last days upon the Jews. (verse. 7. 8 9.)

3. The arrogancy of their heart, and their proud designs. (verse. 10. 11. 12.
13.)

4. The comforts which God enterlaceth for the strengthening of the hands and
hearts of his people, in that the end of all this is to glorify Gods name in

their foes, (verse. 14. 15. 16.) and nothing comes by chance, God has spoken
of this very man, and of his raging against the Church by the Prophets that
were of old: (verse. 17.) for though by name Gog be not elsewhere mentioned, yet
under other names this very tyrant is particularly described.

5. The destruction of this enemy: where you have; 19. Posit. Gods fighting.


First, Gods fighting against them from heaven, as Esaias 26. (verse. 18. to the
end of the Chapter.)

Secondly, their fall in the land of Israel. (Chap. 39. 17. Posit. Place of
the conflict.
verse. 1. 2. 3. 4 5.)

Thirdly, the utter abolishing of the Turkish name, (ver. 18. Posit. Conquest.
6.) the end whereof is declared (Gods glory) [vers. 7.] and the certainty.
[vers. 8.]

Fourthly, the abundance of spoil which the Jews shall carry away. [vers. 9.
10.]

Fifthly, the wonderful slaughter that shall be made of them; for 1. they
shall be seven months in burying: [verse 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16.] where, by the
way, the place of this noble victory seems to be pointed at, the great blow
or 21. Posit. Place of the armies discomfit.

rendered thus, 20. Posit. Place of Gogs Fall.
And also the multitude thereof shall be a name unto the City, that is,
Jerusalem it self shall have part of the honor, as Joel. 3. 2. 2. Yet for all
that, multitudes shall ye unburied, to be meat for the fowls of the heaven,
and the beasts of the earth: which is uttered by a solemn proclamation to these
fowls and beasts [vers. 17. 18. 19. 20.] as Revel. 19. 17. 18. in this very
argument.

Lastly, this whole matter is shut up with declaration of the end of all these
things: to wit, Gods glory, (verse. 21. to the end of the chapter.)

After the defeat of Gog and Magog, comes in the last eight chapters, a new
prophecy, aptly depending upon the former, concerning the Christian Jewish
Church, settled in their own land and Country, which is the fourth and last
step. Christ, the builder of his temple, appearing in the form of a man, like
polished shining brass, to prefigure the splendour of that Church. No marvel
then if so great a matter require such a vehement and solemn charge to stir
up the Prophet unto attention. Son of man. see with thine eyes, and hear
with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all which I shall show thee. Hardly
in the whole book of God shall you find such an other. (chap. 40. 1. 2. 3. 4.)

The thing it self is thus expressed:

1. There shall a new Church be erected by the preaching of the Gospel: which
the measuring of the house, 7. Posit. General call.
(verse. 5. to the end of the chapter.) the temple, (chap. 41.) and the courts,
(chap. 42.) and of all the parts notes. But both these measurements, and
whatsoever follows touching the division of the land, the seats of the
Tribes, the portions allotted to the Prince, Priests, and Levites, the manner
of their sacrifices and oblations, or all new, varying from that which is in
Moses (though for their weakness by those outward things he shadoweth
heavenly) to show the abrogating of the legal ceremonies.

2. The Lord who had left the Temple and the City, Ezech. 10. does now return,
and fills this house with the 31. Posit. Glorious church
glory of his presence (chap. 43. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.)

3. The sanctity of the Church purged from Idolatry, Superstition, and
Will Worship. They shall not, says he, 34. Posit. Purity.
defile my house any more with their spiritual whoredoms, nor with the
carcasses of their Kings in their high places (that is the sacrifices of man's
flesh, as Jeremy 16. 18. which they offered to Moloch, Leuit. 18. 21. whom they
called their King, Amos 5. 56. after the manner of the Ammonites, whose Idol
it was) and so by their own iniquities making a wall of separation between me
and them. (Chap. 43. 6, 7, 8, 9.)

And this sanctity of the Church he does afterward enlarge by the types of
the ceremonial service. (Chap. 43. 10. to the end of the Chapter.)

4. The refining of the ministry and discipline of the Church, with the same
charge in regard of the excellency 33 Posit. Sanctity.
of the matter, repeated for attention. (chap. 44. 1. to ver. 17.) and laws
prescribed to that purpose. (verse. 17. to the end of the Chapter.)

5. Provision for the Church-seruice. Which this people shall be most zealous
of. Allotting before any divident of the land, a portion to be set apart for
the house of the Lord, the Priests, the Levites, the people, and the Prince.
(chap. 45. 1. to verse. 9.) That both Prince and people might have whereof to
make oblations, (verse. 9, 10, 11, 12.) with laws also concerning these
matters. (verse. 13. to the end of the Chapter.)

6. The fruitfulnes of the land, by the waters flowing 36 Posit. Spiritual
graces.
abundantly out of the Temple, that is, by the blessing of God dwelling among
them. Wherein is set forth,

1. The rising and increase of these waters (figuring the graces of Gods Spirit
in his Church). First, ancle-deepe, then up to the knees, after to the loins,
lastly not passable. A man might swim in them. (Chap. 47. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

2. This blessing should be over all the land. for The waters should issue unto
Galilee, (the upper part of Iudaea) and so go down into the plain, where
Jericho stood. (verse. 6, 7. and 1 part of 8.)

3. The fruit hereof is singular. It brings life, health, and all good
things: it heals and puts away all evil. Insomuch as these waters running
from the plain of Jericho to the Sea (the dead Sea, or the Lake called
Asphaltites, the salt Lake, (where nothing was wont to grow) the same shall now
from one end to an other (from Engedie to En-eglaim) abound with fish and store
of commodities. Yea even, the mirie places thereof and the marshes thereof,
which were not (before that time) healed, but were employed to salt: neither

THe fourth kingdom is the Roman Empire, whose legs are of iron. (verse. 40.)

The feet and toes part of iron and part of clay, (verse. 41, 42, 43.) are the
Roman Empire yet continuing; but weaker then it was before, whilst it
consisted of legs of iron, being now but of feet and toes. And this Empire is
divided, as the feet and toes are. One part is the kingdom of the Pope in the
West (for he is the 7th head of the beast Rev. 17. 10, 11. He whom we call the
Emperor, has nothing to do with the Empire, which was of Rome). The other part
is the Turk in the East, before whom 3 of the horns of the Empire are rooted
out. See Dan. 7. 8. It is evident that these feet and toes are part of the
Roman Empire: for the Image describes only 4. Kingdoms. But if the feet
and toes were a distinct kingdom from the legs, there should be five.

The kingdom raised up in those days, which shall 46 Posit. Enemies subdued.
not be destroyed for ever, but shall destroy all other kingdoms, is the
kingdom of the Jews. (verse. 44, 45.)

Whose Church is the stone hewn out of the mountain without hands. Till which
time the Roman Empire shall endure, and then wholly be destroyed.

Chap. 7.
THE 4 beasts (verse. 3.) are 4 kingdoms, as it is expounded verse. 17. whereof,
The first beast a Lion, is the kingdom of the Assyrians, extinct, and gone
before Daniel saw the Vision. (verse. 4)

The second a Bear, is the Persian Monarchy. (v. 5.)

The third, a Leopard, the Greek Monarchy or the Kingdom of the Macedonians.
(verse. 6.)

The fourth is, the Roman Empire: whose X. horns (verse. 7.) are 10 kingdoms
not diverse from that of the beast. For then there should be 5. Kingdoms,
contrary to that is said here verse. 17. And these 10 Kingdoms are the 10
horns of the Dragon. Rev. 12. 3.

The little horn that grew out among them (1 part of verse. 8.) is the Turk,
the Dragon of the sixth Viale Revel. 16. 13. Of whom only, and of the rest of
the enemies that should oppress the Jews, Daniel speaks without any respect
to the west Antichrist.

By this little horn three of those horns were rooted out. (2 part of verse.
8.) That is, a third part of the Roman Empire subdued; which yet retains 7
horns, whereof the Turk shall never be Lord and Master, further then as he
may by some sudden storm for a while oppress them. This third part of the
Roman Empire so to be destroyed, is intended from East to West, not from South
to North. For therein the Turk possesses more then ever the Romans had.

This little horn must reign till the thrones be taken away, 18 Posit.

and the ancient of days sit. (verse. 9.) That is, till after all the
kingdoms of the world destroyed, the whole principality remain with Christ;
as presently it shall, after this blasphemous horn, the Turk, cut of. And
till that time, the fourth beast is not to have an end.

The continuance of the Turkish tyranny, shall be, a time, times, and a
division of times. (verse. 25.) that is, a set time, set 11 Posit. Time of first

times and a half; as it is explaned Dan. 12. 7. Of what length that is, may
be understood by Rev. 9. 13. that gives him an hour, a day, a month and a
year: which in all (accounting a day for a year) comes to 395 days. A time
then is 100 years: times, 200 years: half a time, 50 years. So the whole
space, if you account from the beginning of the Turkish power, which all
histories place Anno 1300, will end at they year 1650. But that you will say
comes short of that, which is in the Revelation, by 45 years. The reason is,
because the Revelation sets down the uttermost period of the Turkish name;
but the Angel here, and Dan. 12. 7. notes his first declining, which shall be
45 years before, as is apparent Dan. 12. 11, 12. So Dan. 11. 44. tidings shall
first trouble him, and then a few years after follows his utter destruction
in the land of comeliness. The distribution therefore of time, both here and
Dan. 12. 7. reaches no further then to those tidings. And then shall the

Dan. 9. 24. etc. to the end of the Chapter. 31 Posit. Glorious church

DANIELS weeks (as they are commonly termed) belong in part to this Argument:
for in them is foretold the destruction of the City and Temple at Jerusalem,
for the Jews contempt in rejecting the Messiah. But this requires some larger
Tractate. And therefore I refer it to the end of the Book.

Dan. chapters 11. and 12.
THese two Chapters are a prophecy of the manifold oppression of Gods people
the Jews, and of the happy issue, which God shall send.

Oppressors there are five.

First, the Persian Monarchy. (ve. 1, 2.)

Secondly, the Graecians, to wit, Alexander the Great, his four successors,
the Ptolomees and Antiochus. (verse. 3. to the 36 verse.)

Thirdly, the Roman Empire: under the name of that King. (verse. 36, to verse.
40.)

Fourthly, the Saracens pointed at under the name of the King of the South. Who
in the time of the end, meaning toward the end of the glory of the Roman
Empire, having Mahomet for their Captain, assaulted the Roman territories out
of Arabia, and other mere Southerly countries. (1 part of verse. 40.)

Lastly, the King of the North. That is, the Turk, whom the furthest northern
parts sent into the world thorough the Caspian gates. (2 part of verse. 40.)

Him you have described,

First by his prospering against the Saracens and Romans, (3 part of verse. 40.)
against Iudaea, the land of comeliness, and other adjoining countries, (verse.
41.) Egypt, Lybia and Aethiopia. (verse. 42, 43.)

Secondly, by his ruin and downfall. Whereof two steps are noted.

One, his first declining upon the Jews of the East and 10 Posit. First
converted.
North countries, converted to the Christian faith. Which must needs terribly
affright him, being then beset before with us Christians of the West, and
behind by the new Christian Jews. (verse. 44.)

The other his utter overthrow by war in the land of Iudaea; which is here
described by two notes: one in saying, between the Seas, meaning Euphrates
(which the 17 Posit. Place of conflict.
Scripture is wont to call a Sea) and the Syrian Creek of the Mediterranean
Sea. The other, at the holy mount of Comeliness, (as Iudaea is called the
Comeliness of all Countries. 20 Posit. Place of Gogs fall.
Ezech. 20. 6, 15.) which does explane the former, and more particularly
design the place where the Grand Signior himself shall fall, at the holy
mountain, as Esaias 24. 25. whose fall is first closely and covertly pointed at
by a rare and extraordinary word (tents of the ire of his Judgment) used for
this only purpose, to note his extraordinary and heavy punishment. (1 part of
verse. 45.) as Esaias 30. 33. Then it is in express words laid forth, and the
manner also signified how he shall come to his end, there shall be none to
help him. As if he would say, his overthrow shall come 19 Posit. Gods fighting.
not so much from the force of man, as by Gods own arm from heaven stretched
out against him. (2 part of verse. 45.)

Hitherto of the oppression of the Jews. The joyful and happy issue
conteyneth four things.

1. A wonderful deliverance from the sorest time of affliction that ever was.
(chap. 12. verse. 1.) 16 Posit. Sore distress.


2. The full restoring of the Nation of the Jews, and 7 Posit. General call.
the calling of them to faith in Christ, meant here, by their awaking out of
the dustie earth. (1 part of verse. 2.) Of the last resurrection you cannot take
it. For the certain time when this shall be is defined in the 11 and 12 verses.

But withal a certain qualification is made, that some which shall awake and
be so delivered, shall awake to everlasting 9 Posit. Wrath against refractaries.
shame and destruction. For all the Jews shall not agree in the same truth,
some shall persist in their former hardness, notwithstanding all the evident
testimonies that God shall give unto his Son. For whom there remains Read
Verse 45. the first part of it thus. And he shall plant the tents of the wrath
of his judgment, between the Seas etc. no further promise of grace. (2 part
of verse. 2.)

3. Their glorious Church. Those that are wise, that is, 31 Posit. Glorious
church
the whole company of the faithful, shall shine as the firmament. But the
teachers, those that make other righteous, by teaching, exhorting, reproving,
comforting, as the more lightsome part of their orb, like shining stars shall
beautify this firmament. (verse. 3.) For it is said here, they that be wise and
do make righteous, in the present, not in the time past. Which is a proof that
he speaks not of the last resurrection.

4. The time when all this shall be. (verse. 4.)

Which time is doubly designed.

First in general, by an Angels question unto Christ. (verse. 5, 6) and Christ's
answer with a solemn oath, that 11 Posit. Time of first conversion.
the end of these marvelous things shall be at a time, two times, and half a
time. Which words being general and uncertain, and to be applied to any time,
are in the words following reduced to one certain and definite time: namely,
when he shall make an end of scattering the holy people. The meaning therefore
is, that this end shall be, when the blasphemous kingdom of the Turks is at
an end: that is, after 350 years of the Turkish power, which has his
expiration about Anno 1650. At what time God will leave scattering of his holy
people, and of further pouring out his wrath upon them. For then shall the
Turks first declining come. (verse. 7.)

Secondly, it is set forth in more particular manner, and diuidedly, upon
Daniels humble suite. (verse. 8.) yet not for his understanding from whom these
things were shut up, (verse. 9.) but for the Elects sake in succeeding ages, in
whom these things amidst their many trials may breed constancy and sweet
comfort, and who about the end of these things shall be diligent to search out
the truth hereof. (verse. 10.)

First therefore he makes one common beginning of the account. From the daily
sacrifice taken away, (which was done by the death of Christ) and from the
laying of the abomination desolate. for so I would translate these words. (1
part of verse. 11.) By abomination he means the Jews sacrificings; which
were impious and abominable after Christ by his death had set an end to them.
The laying of this abomination desolate, was by the last public overthrow of
the legal service in the destruction of Jerusalem. Not that by Vespasian, but
in the time of Julian, when the Apostata, in hatred of the Christian name,
giving the Jews leave to repair the Temple, and that at the public charge.
God by an earthquake did utterly throw down the old foundations, that never
afterward any thing could be attempted in that kind. This was about the year
360.

From hence grows a twofold period or a double appointed term. One 1290
days, (2 part of verse. 11.) 11 Posit. Time of first conversion.
that is to say, years. (for morning and evening are not set down to note
them to be natural days, as before chap. 8. 11.) Adding therefore 1290 to 360,
there will arise 1650. which is the year of the Turkish power first declining,
and perfectly accomplished in the time, times, and half a time before verse. 7.

The second period or praefixed time (verse. 12.) is 1335 days or years, which
adds 45 years to the former, 22 Posit. Time of conquest.
and ends at the year 1695. Being that space of an hour, day, month, and a
year Rev. 9. 15. when the Turkish tyranny shall be utterly extinct and rooted
out. And blessed indeed are they that attain this time, as the Angel here
says. For this is the glorious resurrection spoken of verse. 2. and the
greatest felicity that it is possible for Gods Saints to come unto upon earth.

HOSHEA.
THE three first Chapters of Hoshea, and the sour last, are spent in this
Argument. An entire explication of the whole Prophecy, I purposely reserve to
the end of the Book.

Joel, according to the common distinction which we follow, chap. 2. verse 28.
to the end of the book.
THE Prophet from temporal things leads the people to the consideration of
spiritual blessings, which are;

1. The graces of the Spirit that upon Christ's ascension shall be powered upon
the Church, for so the Apostle interprets this place, Act. 2. (chap. 2. verse.
28. 29. 30. 31.)

2. A holy seed or remnant to remain among the Jews. (1. part of verse. 32.)

2. The cause of this judgment, their ill entreating of his people. (2. part

3. An enumeration of some particular foes, (verse. 4.) whose hard dealing with
the people is likewise reckoned, (verse. 5. 6.) and their just retribution:
(verse. 7.) for as they sold the children of Judah and Jerusalem to the Grcians,
that they might be carried far from their borders: so will God sell their
sons and daughters into the hands of the 46 Posit. Enemies possessed.
children of Judah, who shall sell them to the Sabaeans, famous Merchants, that

6. Perpetuity of their abode there. (verse. 15.) 26. Posit. Continue for ever.


Obadiah, verse 15.
IT is ordinary with the Prophets, upon occasion of the cruelty of the
oppressors of Gods people to break forth into meditation of the kingdom of
Christ, and the glory of the new Jerusalem; so does our Prophet here: His
meditation contains,

(verse. 15.)

2. The time, after the Jews have drunk of the cup of 4 Posit. Desolation.

The 19. and 20: Verses thus I render. Verse. 19. The house of Jacob shall
possess the South, with the Mount of Esau, and the low place with the
Philistims: They shall possess I say the Country of Ephraim, with the Country

Captives, shall possess that which was the Canaanites, unto Sarepta (the
border of the X. Tribes, the Israelites situate between Tire and Sidon at the
Seaside 1 Kings 17. 9.) and those of Jerusalem that were carried away
Captives, shall possess that which is in the bounder of the government. They
shall possess the Cities of the South (the border of Judah, Josh. 15. 21. etc.)


Micah. 7. 7. to the end.
AFter complaint made of the iniquity of the times, the Prophet first exhorts
Gods people to faith, patience and expectation of the promises, (verse. 7. 8.

IT seems that the thirteenth verse cannot be understood of the Babylonians
that never were made a spoil unto the Jews, but the promises of the Gospel
which are annexed to it, lead us by the hand to the finding out of the enemy
that should be meant. Wherefore the Prophet in these four verses sets forth;

1. The Jews subduing of the proud tyrant, under whom they now sigh and groan
by the power of Christ. 18. Posit. Conquest.
(verse. 9.)

2. Christ's dwelling among them, that is to say, their 5 Posit. Call.

4. The Jews inhabiting in their own land. (verse. 12.) And so this whole

setting forth the glory, holiness, and majesty of the work. (verse. 13.)

Zachary. Chap. 8. verse. 7. 8. and again, verse. 20. 21. 22. 23.
THE conference of these latter verses with the former two teaches the true
sense and understanding of them. The seventh and eight contain a promise:

First, of the gathering of the Jews to seek Christ out 5. Posit. Call.
of all the parts of the world where they be scattered. (verse. 7.)

2. Of their dwelling and inhabiting in Jerusalem, their 23 Posit. Dwell in

3. Of Gods gracious and constant covenant with them. 35. Posit. Covenant.
(2. part of ver. 8.)

The four latter verses (20. 21. 22. 23.) speak of the Gentiles of all
tongues and languages, joining with the 44. Posit. All Nations embracing Christ.
Jews in the worship of the same God: which respects the time of the Jews
conversion, and of the full coming in of the Gentiles.

Zachary, Chapter 9. Verse. 10. to the end of the chapter.
TO the promise of Christ's coming (verse. 9.) he adds others.

1. The Gentiles receiving of him: I will take away, says he, the instruments
of war: in the Church shall be all peace, and the Gentiles, yea the farthest
and most remote shall be received into the fellowship and participation of that
peace. (verse. 10.)

(1. part of verse. 12.)

5. The excellent work that God will perform for them as Micah 7. 15. (2. part

be the overthrow by their hands, (the hands of Judah and Ephraim, to note that
all the XII. Tribes shall be called) of that Greek Tyrant 8 Posit. X. Tribes.

glory, (3. part of verse. 15.) and render praise abundantly, (4. part of verse

16.) young men and maids filling themselves with the spoils of their enemies.
(verse. 17.)

By all laid together, it appears that these things are not to be referred to
the story of the Maccabees.

GOd being to inform his people of wonderful things which he will do for
them, begins with a glorious and magnificent proeme of his own greatness,
(v. 1.) and then numbreth the particulars.

1. The famous victory which the men of Judah and 18 Posit. Conquest.
Jerusalem shall get of their enemies. He means no doubt Gog and Magog. And
this by diverse all egories and similitudes is notably enlarged. (verse. 2. to v.
97.) and the excellency of strength and valor declared, which God will
minister to them all equally for their defense, that none lift up themselves
above an other, but all alike ascribe the glory unto God. (verse. 7, 8.)

2. The serious and unfeigned repentance of the whole 5. Posit. Call.
Nation, who shall power forth rivers of tears, every one severally and apart:
God by his Spirit of grace effectually touching their hearts with a compunction
of their former sin, in crucifying the Lord of glory. (verse. 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14.)

3. The riches of Gods mercy, washing away the foulness of their horrible
sin, by the infinite virtue of Christ's sacrifice. (Chap. 13. 1.) 34 Posit
Purity of doctrine.


4. The purity of Religion and of the Gospel among them, purged from
idolatry (1 part of verse. 2.) and false doctrine. (2. part of verse. 2.) For
such false Teachers shall either be put to death, yea even by their own father
and mother, being the first accusers according to the law. Deuteronomy. 13. (so great
shall be the zeal of this people turning unto God) [vers. 3.] or shall be
forced to renounce their errors for shame (verse. 4, 5.) or punishment (verse. 6.)

Zach. chap. 13. verse. 7. to the end of the Prophecy.
THE Prophet either begins here a new Sermon, or takes up anew the things
which he spoke before: worthy again and again to be beaten upon for the
singular and unspeakable comfort of his Nation. He makes himself a passage to
the things he means to speak, by preventing an objection, the scandal of
the death of Christ. whom all forsook when he was betrayed. (1 part of verse.
7.) Yet (says he) I will hold my hand over my little ones, keep and preserve
my little flock unto everlasting life. (2 part of verse. 7.)

This objection taken away, and the doubt cleared, now he reckons the good
things that God will graciously deal unto the Jews.

3. Their wealth and substance shall become a prey. (2 part of verse. 14.)

Secondly, is enlarged the profession of Christ among 44 Posit. All nations

Romans 9. 27. to the end of the 11th Chapter.
THree things the Apostle here debateth.

First is the rejecting of the Jews to be no more 21 Posit. Retection.
Gods people, for seeking righteousness by their own works, and not by faith
in Christ. (which lasts from Chap. 9. 27. to the 11. Chapter.)

The second, that God yet has left a remnant, a holy 3 Posit. Remnant.
seed, (chap. 11. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.) notwithstanding that Israel in general
be hardened. (verse. 7, 8, 9, 10.)

The third, that God will have mercy upon them, and receive them at the last.
Whereunto our Apostle comes 5 Posit. Call.
by degrees.

1. He shows Gods purpose in casting them off. Not for their utter ruin, (1
part of verse. 11.) but for a threefold end. One that a way may be made for the
Gentiles to be saved. (2 part of verse. 11.) An other, that thorough the grace
offered to the Gentiles, themselves might be provoked to a holy emulation. as
Esaias 2. 2, 3, 4. (last part of verse. 11.) A third, that their taking to at the
last, may much more cause the Gospel to be published among all Nations. (verse.
12.) which two latter ends, the second and the third, are amplified in their
order. (The second, verse. 13, 14. The third, verse. 15.)

2. He proves it by a notable Argument. In that the root being holy, the
branches must needs be so. (verse. 16.)

3. He exhorts the Gentiles not to insult upon them. (verse. 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22.)

4. He declares that God is able to graffe them in, (verse. 23.) by a greater
example of Gods power upon us Gentiles. (verse. 24.)

5. He lays down the doctrine it self of Gods pleasure and will to graffe
them in indeed. (verse. 25.)

6. He fortifieth the same by Scripture, (verse. 26, 27.) by Gods unrepentant
counsels, (verse. 28, 29.) and by the like example of the Gentiles. (verse. 30,
31.)

7. And lastly, he shuts up all with the admiration of Gods wisdom and
unsearchable judgments in this behalf. (verse. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.)

2 Cor. 3. 16.
IS express, that as now they are hardened, so one day 2 Posit. Reiection.
their heart shall turn unto the Lord.

2 Thessalonians. 2. 8. 5. Posit. Call.

THe destroying of that wicked one by the brightness 31 Posit. Glorious church
of Christ's coming, is meant of the glory and excellency of Christ appearing
in the Jews conversion, as Math. 24. 30. Rev. 1. 7. For though Rome shall
before that be overthrown, yet till then, Popery shall not wholly fall, nor
Antichrist be utterly done away. Of the end of the world it cannot be
understood, seeing it is evident the Turk shall hold out some-while after the
beast and false Prophet, both triple crown and Papal dignity done away. Rev.
20. 8, 9, 10.

THE REVELATION.
IN the Book of the Revelation, I will but point at some principal things.

REVEL. 1. 7.
Behold he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him. Yea even they
which pierced him thorough. And all the Tribes of the earth shall wail before
him. Even so. Amen.

JOHN having rendered praise to God for his mercy to the Gentiles, does now
celebrate his goodness that shall be most conspicuous in the calling of the
Jews. 5. Posit. Call.


1. Expressing the great glory that shall appear in their conversion by
Christ's glorious coming in the clouds to judgment: whereof this (of all
things in the world) is the most express and lively image.

2. The wayling here spoken of, are the tears of true repentance; as is
manifest by the Prophet Zachary, from whom this place is borrowed. Zach. 12.
10.

3. The name of Tribes shows of what people it is meant: which in the Prophet
is more manifest.

4. In saying all the Tribes, the 10 Tribes are included. 8 Posit. X. Tribes.


Rev. 16. 12. to the end of the Chapter.
THE very course of time being after the Sea of the beast (Rome) overthrown,
leads us by the hand to the exposition of the sixth Viale. To understand it of
the Jews, who are here called Kings of the East, which style of Kings is given
them, Psalm. 68. 29. Esaias 24. 21.

1. Is the repair to their own homes upon the beginning 12 Posit. Repayr
toward their Country.
of Grace wrought in their hearts.

2. God for them will lay dry the waters of Euphrates, as once he did the red
Sea, Esaias 11. 15. (verse. 12.) 13 Posit. Euphrates dry.


3. Hereupon the Dragon (the Turk, Christ's open professed enemy, to leave
what may be said from hence 16 Posit. Sore distress.
of the beast and the false Prophet, a more subtle and close adversary) shall
come with his Begs and Bashawes to destory 15 Posit. Conflict with Gog.
this people. (verse. 13. 14. 15.) This is the sore time of affliction
mentioned, Dan. 12. 1.

4. The conflict shall be at Harmageddon, the mount of delightfulness that is
in the holy land, as Dan. 11. and 17 Posit. Place of conflict.
even as may be thought at Jerusalem it self. (verse. 16.)

5. The issue appears in the VII. Vial, the utter ruin 18 Posit. Conquest.
of the whole kingdom of darkness, whereof the Turkish or Mahometicall
tyranny is a principal. (verse. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21.)

Chap. 19. 5. to the end of the book.
FRom hence to the end of the Revelation are four steps or degrees: the same
(though not altogether in the same order) that we noted, Ezech. 37. Which
maruellouslie cleereth the understanding of this Prophecy. First, after Romes
funeral; for which the Jews as well as Gentiles break forth into
thanksgiving: (as Amen, Halleluiah, verse. 4. one Hebrew by birth, but made a
Greek Denisen, the other a mere Hebrew word imports) they now settling
themselves after the great obstacle of their repentance (the idolatry of the
Romish Church) removed, 5. Posit. Call.
to lend their cares to Christ; comes the first call of that Nation, for the
intimating whereof only the Hebrew word (Halleluiah) in this place is used.
(verse. 5. 6.) It is expressed:

1. By the preparing of her self for the selemnization of the marriage. (verse.
7.)

2. By the marriage garment which they put on, the clean and fine linen of
the righteousness of Christ imputed to the Saints, and by faith made theirs.
(verse. 8. 9. 10.)

The second step (after some other things enterlaced, wherewith I shall not
need to meddle) is the battle with Gog and Magog, under the conduct of the
Turk, (Satan or the Devil, whose Minister he is) the chief principal cause
being put for the isntrumental. This enemy rising some 1000 years after
Constantine, that is about Anno 1300. (verse. 7.) and prospering exceedingly,
(1. part of verse. 8.) warring all the while with the Saints (2. part of verse.
8.) shall at the last when their appointed period draws to an end, bend all
his force against the converted Jews.

1. Is noted the place of this conflict: They compassed the 20 Pesit. Place of
Gogs Fall.
beloved City, (3. part. of verse. 8.) for the brunt of the battle shall be
before Jerusalem, in the valley of Iehoshaphat, as Joel 3. 2.

2. The defeat of the whole Army by strange and extraordinary judgments of God
from heaven, as Esaias 27. 1. 19 Posit. Gods fighting.
(verse. 9.)

3. The final ruin of this tyrant, his state and person, 18. Posit. Conquest.
and whole succession of the Turkish Empire. (verse. 10.)

The third step is the full conversion of this people, betaking 7 Posit.
General call.
themselves to Christ, or rather Christ taking them unto him, their taking to,
as it is said, Romans 11. 15. which the Apostle in that place calls life from
the dead, from the death of sin and infidelity. And therefore is here
gloriously described under the form of the general resurrection: Whereunto the
Scripture in this argument does ordinarily allude, Ezech. 37. Esaias 26. 19. Dan.
12. 2. Hosh. 13. 14. Romans 11. 15. (verse. 11. 12, 13. 14. Though this be not 9
Posit. Wrath against refractaries.
the common condition of all, some will remain obstinate, whose end shall be
most iniferable: As Dan. 12. 2. (verse. 15.)

The fourth and last step is the glory of the Christian 31. Posit. Gloricus
Church.
Jewish Church, dwelling in their own homes, when their enemies are once
subdued under them, in the 21. and 22. chapters. The last 8. chapters of
Ezechiel are of the same argument: but (as the dispensation of those times made
it needful) under the shadows of heavenly things here, more magnificently by
heavenly things themselves. It was showed unto John in two visions: first, in a
kind of generality, then more distinctly.

The former contains.

1. A new face of things in their happy and glorious renouation, by the power
of the Gospel. which shall bring 34. Posit. Purity.
them quite out of love with their former legal worship: (chap. 21. 1.) as
Esaias 65. 17. for this passing away of the first heaven and the first earth, and
that the Sea was no more, is that shaking of heaven and earth, of the sea, and
of the dry land: whereof Haggai prophesies, Hag 2. 7.

2 The sanctity of this City; for first it is altogether 34. Posit. Purity.
New, if you compare it with the staynes and blemishes that the Churches of us
Gentiles are tainted with, though we also make a part of the heavenly
Jerusalem, Gal. 4. 26. Heb. 12. 22. Secondly, it is of a divine offspring,
coming down from God out of heaven. Thirdly, she is clothed with the
righteousness of the Saints, as a bride trimmed for her husband. (verse. 2.)

5. Heaviness and sorrow shall be taken from them, (verse. 4.) as Esaias 25. 8.
39 Posit. Prosperity.


All which things are solemnly confirmed by the authority of him that cannot

arguments of 9 Posit. Wrath against refractaries.
Gods glory shining so clearly, some will remain fearful to profess
Christ, unbelievers, etc. as before, chap. 20. 15. (verse. 8.)

great high mountain) [vers. 10.] declares,

1. Her glory, so great, that she shall be the enlightener 31. Posit. Glorious

7. The purity of Church Discipline, that no impure or unclean thing shall
enter thither. (verse. 27.) 33 Posit. Sanctity.


8. Plenty of spiritual graces, through the pure streams of living water,

whereof are able to heal all the diseases and ulcers of the soul. (verse. 2.)
Compare Zach. 14. 8. and Ezekiel. chap. 47. But where Zachary speaks of waters

meant of the throne of God and the Lamb, that is, from the grace and favor of
God in Christ.

AN EXPOSITION Upon the 24. 25. 26. and 27. Chapters of the Prophet ESAIAS:
Together with some few Observations thereupon.
1. Behold JEHOVAH emptieth the land, and lays it waste; and Hebr. Petuerteth
the face thereof.
turueth it vpside-downe, and scatters abroad the inhabitants thereof.

2. And it shall be as with the people, so with the Priest, as with the
servant, so with his master, as with the maid, so with her mistress: as with
the buyer, so with the seller, as with the lender, so with the borrower, as
with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

3. The land shall be clean In emptying shall be emptyed, and in spoiling
shall be spoiled.
emptied, and utterly spoiled: for JEHOVAH has spoken this word.

4. The land shall mourn and fade away, the inhabited world shall languish and
fade away, she The height of the people.
haughty people of the land shall languish.

EXPOSITION.
THese four Chapters contain one whole and entire Prophecy. It has two
divided members: One of the reiection of the Jews, the other of their
receiving in the last days into the flock of Christ.

The reiection, in the first 20. verses of the 24th. chapter, sets forth the
most woeful desolation that any story can 4 Posit. Desolation.
give example of.

Which though it be of things to come many hundred of years after, the Prophet
as one that saw them in the Spirit, as if they were then done, utters not
only in the future, but sometimes in the present, sometimes in the time past
by an Idiom proper to the Prophets, to note how certain they are to take
effect.

This threatened desolation is garnished and set forth five manner of ways.

First, needs must it be a matter of some rare and marvelous consequence,
that, Behold, the O-yes of the Holy Ghost is set before.

Secondly, the Author and efficient is God.

Thirdly, you have a distribution. The land, says he, (meaning the land of
Israel and Judah) shall be emptied both of inhabitants, and of all other
things: Every thing shall be turned vp-side down; the inhabitants scattered
and dispersed.

Here are both the parts comprehended verse 1. which are afterward
distinguished in the rest that follows to 14. verse.

Touching the persons or inhabitants. 1. There shall be a general destruction
of all states and degrees: no difference, 2.
high and low, rich and poor shall be dealt with all alike.

2. They shall be all spoiled of their choice and precious treasures, which is
verified from the mouth of him that 3.
cannot lie, and is able to perform his threatenings.

3. They shall mourn, they shall pine away and be enfeebled: perish through
their own weakness, even the 4.
high and lofty ones shall pine away.

Observations.
This noble prophecy affords many sweet and heavenly lessons.

1. Iehovah] First, God is the Author of all judgments. Is there any evil in
the City, which Jehovah does not. Amos 3. 6. I create the destroyer to
destroy. Esaias 54. 16. This which seems a lesson so easy and familiar, it is
most necessary to take out, that we may learn to humble our selves under his
hand. for all his works are holy and just: and who can resist his counsels?

Emptieth the land] 2. Flourishing States and Commonwealths (how much more
particular persons?) he is able to throw down and lay all their honor and
glory in the dust. As what state or kingdom was at this time greater then the
Jews. Amos 6. 2. Pass unto Calne (a famous City in the land of Shinear. Genesis
10. 10.) and see, and from thence go to great Hammath, and get you down to
Gath of the Philistims. Are they better then these kingdoms? (of Israel and
Judah) or is their border larger then your borders?

The land] 3. He spares not his own people, when they transgress against
him; yea the nearer he comes to them in his favors and blessings, the higher
he lifts his hand to beat and to correct them, when they do amiss? For
great offenses God cannot in justice but requite with great punishments.

Emptieth etc. turns etc.] 4. His threatenings are most certain, and as good
as now done, though they be denounced thousands of years before.

2. And it shall be as with etc.] 5. Dignity and wealth cannot hinder him.
Does he esteem nobility, or riches, or any thing that fortifieth strength?
Ioh. 36. 19. Poverty, nor base estate finds any favor with him.

3. The land shall be spoyled] 6. Riches is a vain thing to help in the time
of need, which are subject to be spoiled and taken from us: why then should we
spend our time and bestow our strength upon things that are unprofitable? Let
us rather labor for the things that cannot perish: That treasure which none
can rob us of.

For Jehovah has spoken] 7 How deeply soever we be planted, though it be as
Tyrus which had her biding in the Seas; and if with the Babylonian, we have
heaped together riches like thick clay, Abacuc. 2. 6. let us yet fear when
the mouth of God does speak. For his words are not in vain. Does he say and
shall be not do it? Numb. 23. 23.

4. The haughty etc.] 8 The highest must learn to stoop when he threatens.
For he brings leanness upon the fat ones, makes the plump to pine away, and
sends heaviness into their souls.

5. For the land is defiled under the inhabitants thereof: because they have
transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, disanulled the everlasting
covenant.

6. Therefore shall the curse devour the land, and they that dwell therein
shall be desolate: Therefore the inhabitants of the land are burned up, and few
men are left.

EXPOSITION.
COme we now to the causes, the second and vndercauses of so heavy judgments;
which the Prophet 5.
here avoucheth to be the sins of the people. But what sins? First in
general, such and so great, that the land is defiled under these wicked
persons.

Secondly, these sins are set forth in three particulars.

The first, they have transgressed the laws, natural and moral, of duties to
God and to their brethren.

The second is, they have changed the rites and ceremonies instituted of God,
from the right use for the which they were ordained, whilst they see not
Christ in them, the substance of those shadows. Heb. 9. 11. Coloss. 2. 17. For
they all do look to him, as the Cherubins did look with their faces to the
mercy-seat. Exodus 25. 20.

The third is, the disanulling of the Covenant founded in Messia, Christ: when
coming unto his own, his own received him not.

This third, is amplified by the effects; the curse that it brings with it.
But above all, mark the curse here spoken 6.
of, that which the Jews so called and cried for, His blood be upon us, and
upon our children. Math. 27. 25. And therefore (says the Prophet) it shall
most justly come upon them: and as a fire shall devour and consume them.

Observations.
5. For the land] 9 Sin is the proper and immediate cause of all affliction.
For affliction (as Eliphaz tells Job. Job 5. 6, 7.) comes not out of the
dust, neither does vexation spring out of the ground. But man is borne to
trouble, as the sparks of burning coals fly upwards. That is to say: we are
not to ascribe trouble and calamity to chance or other blind causes, but to
the sin that sticks in us.

Why then are we so cruel and unmerciful to our selves, to pull by such
means wrath and judgment upon our own heads?

Defiled] 10 Marvelous is the pollution of sin; that not only staineth and
infecteth the whole man, soul and body, but defiles the ground we tread
upon, and makes the land to groan under the burden of us.

They have transgressed] 11 The law of God is the rule and square of all our
actions.

His commandments are as bounds and banks, which we may not transgress or go
beyond, though it be with never so good intention.

The lawes] 12 There is a double and threefold cord to tie us to the obedience
thereof. One, because they were not only written in our hearts by nature, but
renewed by the voice of God from heaven, when man's corruption had obscured the
brightness of the same. Another for that they contain a perfect comprehension
of all duties whatsoever, which we owe to God or one unto another. Aptly
therefore and properly does the Prophet call them laws in the plural.

Changed the ordinances] When we apply the holy things, especially the rites
and ceremonies that he has instituted, to an other end then for the which they
were ordained, we change the nature of them, and of Gods ordinances do make
them ours. Strange things which God esteems not. Hosh. 8. 12. The excellent
things of my law, which I praescribe unto them, are reckoned as a strange thing.

Couenant] 13 Wonderful is the mercy and goodness of God, that has
vouchsafed to enter into a covenant with his servants, and under certain
conditions, as it were, to contract with them for life eternal.

The condition is, Believe and thou shall be saved. Act. 16. 31.

Everlasting couenant] 14 This covenant, the covenant of peace and
reconciliation through Christ, is an everlasting covenant, a sure covenant, a
covenant of salt, more firmly fixed in his Son, then the Sun and Moon are
fixed in the heavens.

Disanulled] 15 But where men put not forth the hand of faith to reach it to
themselves, this covenant can do no good: no more then the Kings pardon
helps, in case a man refuse to plead and take advantage of it.

Men therefore by their own infidelity reject the counsel and purpose of God
to save them. They shorten his hand and shrink up his arm from doing good.
Marc. 7. 5, 6. He could do no miracle there, because of their unbelief. Oh
what a thing it is, that the fault should rest in us, why Gods covenant can
take no place!

6. Therefore shall the curse devour etc.] 16 As the Covenant embraced
brings life: so the curse of God is inseparably annexed to the transgressing
of it.

Curse] 17 Let men take heed how they use execration, cursing and banning of
their souls. God makes other men's curses to speed, where there is just
cause. Judge. 957. The curse of Iotham came upon the Shechemites. How much more
shall our own curses and imprecations light upon our selves.

For God is just and will not be mocked.

7. The new wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish: all the merry-hearted
shall sigh.

8. The mirth of Tabrets shall cease, the noise of them that rejoice shall
leave: the joy of the harp shall cease.

9. They shall not drink wine with a song: strong drink shall be bitter to
them that drink it.

10. The City Of emptiness.
made empty, shall be broken down: every house shall be shut up; From coming
in.
that none may come in.

11. There shall be a crying concerning wine in the streets: all mirth shall
be darkened; the joy of the land shall slit away.

12. What so is reserved in the City, shall be smitten with desolation: and
with a noise shall the gate be smitten.

13. For thus shall it be in the midst of the land, among the people; as the
shaking of an Olive tree, as gleaning of Grapes, when the vintage is done.

EXPOSITION.
SO much of the persons or inhabitants: the things which they must loose, are,

1. The commodities of the land, wine etc. 7.


2. The joys and pleasures of the land shall be all taken from them. Private
griefs and groanings shall be even to those that are of a merry disposition.

Public joy and merriments, the Timbrell and the 8.
Harp, all solaces of their life shall cease.

And that in their feasts and banquetings: Such a flood 9.
of evils shall ouerwhelme them. Enough to make even their strong drink to be
bitter and out of taste.

3. Company there shall be none: no going in nor out in their streets. 10.


4. Howling and lamentation shall every where be 11.
heard, because of the comforts they have lost. As the air in the evening
waxes dark, so shall their mirth be turned into heaviness.

5. Nothing shall be left free. Havoc shall be made of the things they kept
in store. The gates and strong 12.
holds shall not be able to hold out the enemy.

6. As when the Olive tree is beaten, but a few berries are left remaining, and
scarce a cluster of grape; to be 13.
found (one happily here and there) upon the beginning of 3 Posit. Remnant.
the vintage: so shall there but a few men, a small handful be reserved from
the fury and violence of their foes. Wherein notwithstanding some comfort is
interlaced; that in the midst of this fearful destruction, a remnant, a
holy seed shall be left according to the election of grace, of whom God will
be pleased to gather in time a new Church unto himself. As before Chap. 17. 5,
6. and Esaias 65. 8. See Esaias 6. 13.

Observations.
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The new wine etc.] 18 The good things of this life, not
only for necessity but for honest comfort and recreation, men may lawfully
and with a good conscience use, being sanctified unto us by the word of God and
prayer. 1 Timothy 4. 4, 5.

19 But it is his blessing that gives cheerfulness. When Gods hand is upon
us, it behooves us to be humble, to leave iolitie and merriments, if he call to
heaviness and mourning. The Prophet Esaias 22. 12, 13. finds fault with this,
that when the Lord called to weeping, mourning, baldnes and girding with
sackcloth, behold there was mirth and gladness, killing of oxen, slaying of
sheep, eating of flesh, drinking of wine etc.

13. For thus shall it be etc.] 20 God tempereth his judgments with mercy, and
in his wrath remembers kindness. He never so punishes but he leaves some
matter for his mercy to work upon. As he saved Noah and the 8 persons in the
Arc to replenish the world anew.

14. These shall lift up their voice, and sing: for the excellency of Jehovah,
they shall shoute for joy from the Sea, saying.

15. Therefore in the valleys, glorify ye Jehovah: in the Isles of the Sea,
the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

16. From the skirt of the land we have heard Psalms, comeliness to the just
one, But I say leannesses to me, leanness to me, woe is me: The treacherous
have dealt trecherously, and With treachery of treacherous men.
with most treacherous treachery have they dealt trecherously.

EXPOSITION.
Having thus declared the particulars of this heavy and great calamity, he
proceeds to the fourth general amplification: which is a dissimilitude
between this and their former estate, accompanied with the causes of them
both, and all justified by the voice and suffrage of the people themselves,
those that shall so be reserved, glorifying and praising God. Wherefore the
praises that here they give, are worthy to be considered in five circumstances.

First is the motive to this duty, the excellency of Gods work. 14.


The second circumstance is the manner of giving praise. By shouting, singing,
etc.

The third circumstance is the places from whence these praises shall sound
forth: all parts of the world, the Sea, the valleys, the furthest Isles. 15.


The fourth circumstance, is their stirring up and provoking one an other to
praise God. Glorify ye.

The fifth circumstance, is the person, whom thus they praise, Jehovah the God
of Israel.

These are the circumstances. The argument or matter of their song,
acknowledges (as we said before) the 16
just hand of God upon them, by comparing their former estate with the present.
Before, from every place, in all the quarters of the land, sounded nothing but
Psalms, matter of praise and of thanksgiving. For the people walking in
holiness and righteousness, laying hold upon the righteousness which is by
faith in Christ, received only favors at the hands of God. But now in place of
it is come mourning and complaint, pining away for the calamity and hard
estate, which their grievous transgression has brought upon them.

But as the punishment is most heavy, so the sin here pointed at, is a sin
of all sins, the most superlatiue degree of sin. Such a transgression as
exceeds without comparison all other transgressions that ever were.
Detestable above and beyond all the sins whatsoever of all ages in the world.
What is that? The crucifying of Christ the Lord of Glory, upon a desperate and
deep malice; adding to the same so many circumstances of most notorious
contumacie and ingratitude.

Observations.
14. These shall lift up their voice and sing. For the excellency etc.] 21 The
children of God have their eyes open to see an excellency of wisdom,
justice, goodness; where the world is blind and can discern nothing but
deformity and confusion.

Wherefore though their mouths be stopped up and mousled, that not a word can
come from them to the honor 22
and praise of God; yet the godly find matter not only to speak, but to lift
their voice aloud, yea to sing and shout.

There is a difference between Gods children and the wicked in observing the
works of God. For the wicked 23
themselves are forced to acknowledge Gods justice. As I have done, so has God
rendered unto me. Judge. 1. 7. But Gods children behold an excellency in Gods
works, which makes them with cheerful and joyful hearts to magnify his
name.

The deformities that are in the world, which seem to minister nothing but
just complaint and discontent, fill 24
their mouths with songs and hymns. For they with spiritual eyes discern
that excellency of Gods work, such an abundance of wisdom, power, goodness,
holiness, truth, justice, that makes them perforce to break forth into his
praises.

And this is a holy use of singing and using mirth, when it tends (as David's
Psalms) to the glorifying of the high and mighty works of God, which he would
have to be had in everlasting remembrance.

In the Isles of the Sea] 25 No place should discourage us from serving God: the
solitary wilderness, the Isles that are most comfortles. What and how noble
visions did God reveal to his servant John in the I Will of Patmos, when upon the
Lords day he gave himself in that barbarous place to heavenly meditations?

Glorify ye Iehovah] 26 It is an excellent and a holy duty to quicken others
in piety and godliness, as God by his Spirit has quickened us. Psalm. 122. 1.
I was glad of them that said unto me, Let us go to the house of Jehovah. Zach.
8. 21. The inhabitants of one City shall say unto another, Let us go
diligently to be suitors to Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of Hoastes: I also
will go. And where the zeal of God warmeth at the heart, it will break forth
as fire to the kindling and inflaming of others.

The God of Israel] 27 The true God as he reuealeth himself in the Church is
he that we must honor and serve.

The memorial of whose name is always one and the 28
same. Heretofore known to his people by the name of the God of Israel, but
now manifested unto us more clearly in his Son Christ Jesus; who with the
brightness and excellency of the New Testament, obscureth and drowneth the
former covenant.

And here have you the very mark of the true Church, which is to celebrate and
profess the great and glorious 29.
name of the true God, the God of Israel, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. Sea, valleys] 30 In what place of the world soever any such may be found,
though lurking and lying hid in the midst of most barbarous and savage
Nations, they are to be acknowledged the lively members of the Church invisible.

From the skirt of the land we have heard Psalmes] 31 It is a holy and sweet
music in Gods ears, when as his benefits are general; so general thanks is
given of many. 2 Cor. 1. 11.

16. Comelines to the just:] 32 A land flourishes, and it is well with them
when they fear God and walk in his commandments.

Contrariwise, the rejecting and setting light by Gods mercies offered unto a
people, is the cause of ruin and destruction 33.
of flourishing States and Kingdoms: Never did any people flourish more then
the Israelites, when they kept close to Gods ordinances. Never was there
example seen of such a fearful desolation as befell them, when they fell
from God: which Moses had before threatened, Deuteronomy. 32. and all the world has
seen to come to pass. That in them as in a picture you may behold the truth
of that which Solomon says in his Proverbs, Prove. 14. 34. Righteousness
exalts a Nation: But sin is the reproach of people.

To the just one:] 34 The cause of the bliss of a whole State is for the just
that are among them. Contrary to that the world esteems; which ascribes the
growth of Kingdoms to the wisdom, policy, and power of the State: yea
think the servants of God many times the cause of the calamities that light
upon them, as appears in many of the Edicts of the first Heathen Emperors.
Who notwithstanding have been often driven to acknowledge that God blessed them
for the Churches sake that harbored in their kingdoms.

Most treacherous treachery:] 35 What a fearful sin it is to lend a deaf
ear to Christ? For if it shall be easier for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of
Judgment, then for those that despise his Ministers: what shall be thought of
those that do despise himself?

This is to be noted, because of the steps whereby men climb up to the height
of sinning. For those that make no conscience of Christ's Ordinances, nor to
entertain the Prophets whom he sends, will at the last make no conscience of
killing Christ himself, if they might come by him.

All sins therefore are not equal, neither is there an equality of
punishments. 36.


Man's nature is so dull and heavy, so incapable of holy admonitions, that they
had need to be beaten upon again 37.
and again with variety and heap of words, and particularizing of Gods
judgments: so to fasten them into their hearts, as with goades and nails.
Eccles. 12. 13.

17. Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall come upon thee, O inhabitant of
the Land.

18. For it shrll be, that he that flees because of the voice.
noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the
pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high shall be opened,
and the foundations of the earth shall shake.

19. The land in breaking shall be broken down. So in the rest.
shall be utterly broken down: the land shall be clean dissolved; the land
shall be moved exceedingly.

20. The land shall reele to and fro like a drunken man, and shall flit like a
lodge: and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, so that it shall
fall and rise no more.

EXPOSITION.
Fifthly and lastly, the threatened judgment is set forth by a heap and
multitude of evils, as it were with one breath, instanced in six particulars.

1. All manner of evil shall come. Fear or a horrible fearful and feared
evil; the fear whereof is worse then 17.
the thing we fear: the pit, sudden and unlooked for mischief: the snare,
out of which there will be no getting out.

2. One mischief shall come upon the back of another, that tone or the other
none shall escape. 18.


3. Heaven and earth shall fight against them, and conspire to do them
mischief.

4. A terrible confusion shall be seen. All turned topsie turvie. Every thing
shall go to wrack. 19.


5. Transmigration and flitting up and down. To be a renegate people. 20.


The land, that is, the inhabitants of the land tossed and tumbled from one
place unto another; as a lodge that is made but for a night and taken away
again.

6. A desperate and vnrecoverable downfall. Their transgression, that is, the
punishment of their transgression, as a heavy burden so pressing and weighing
them down, that their end shall be utter ruin, a fall never to be repaired.
Always understanding this one exception, unless it be by the mighty hand and
power of God visiting his people, as sometimes he did their forefathers
oppressed with the hand and intolerable bondage of the land of Egypt. Of
which restitution our Prophet speaks in the verses following.

Observations.
God has multitudes of Judgments at command: his 38
quiver full of arrows and variety of shafts to dart at the wicked.

17. Fear.] 39. The stoutest gallant must stoop and veil his bonnet, he
whose heart is as the heart of a Lion, shall fear when he threatens.

Pit.] 40. Miserable men that promise to themselves all happiness and
prosperity, shall tumble into the pit of Gods Judgments, ere they be aware:
for when they say peace and safety, then shall come upon then sudden
destruction, as to a woman with child, and they shall not escape, 1. These. 5.
3.

Snare.] 41 And when they are once caught and snared in his traps, there is no
means to rid them out: his handstretched forth, who can turn away, Esaias 14.
27.

18. He that.] 42 Let none think to escape the stroke of his arm, one way or
other, the Judgments of God will reach him. He that finds favor and
profits not to seek God by repentance, is but reserved to a further
punishment, as Amos says, Amos 5. 19. He that flies for fear of the Lion,
shall light upon a Bear, and when he comes home and leans upon the wall,
a serpent shall bite him. Why then should any man, walking in his sins,
flatter his own soul and promise to himself peace and happiness, when the
Judgments he sees before his eyes to light upon other, are warnings unto him?

The windows, etc. the foundations, etc.] 43. How great a God have we to deal
withal that has heaven and earth, and the arms of them both at his command:
he set wide open the windows of heaven, and brought a flood upon the world of
the ungodly, 2. Pet. 2. 5. He opened the mouth of the earth to swallow up Kore,
Dathan, and Abiram, Number. 16. what is he not able to do, to work and effect his
judgments?

19. 20. The land etc.] 44 Things so ordered and disposed as in the judgment
of flesh and blood, must needs endure always, he can change and bring unto
confusion. The City of Jerusalem, how well was it knit and compact together,
whilst she was in her prime? read Psalm. 122. the same, how is it now brought
unto most miserable wast and hauock.

Heavy.] 45 Observe the wages of sin, the weight and intolerable burden of
it. There shall the workers of iniquity fall, and never rise up again, Psalm.
36. 12.

21. And it shall be in that same day, Iehoua shall visit the host of that
lofty one, in the lofty place it self; and the Kings of the earth, in this
very land.

22. And they shall be gathered A gathering
prisoner.
together as a prisoner into a pit, and shall be shut up in prison: and after
many days shall be Visited.
punished.

EXPOSITION.
THe 21th verse and so forward comprehends the second part, which is the
Jews restoring in two degrees. First, is the ruin and overthrow of their
proud enemies under whom they were held captives: wherein these circumstances
may be observed: first, in how seasonable a time God will send them help: In
that very day, 21.
the sorest time of their affliction, when all strength is gone, 16. Posit.
Sore destresse.
as Deuteronomy. 32. 36.

2. The enemies they shall subdue: divided into two, 18 Posit. Conquest.
the lofty one himself, and the Kings his associates.

Who is this lofty one here spoken of? Gog and Magog. Revel. 20. 8. or as
Ezechiel has it, Ezech. 38. 2. Gog coming out of the land of Magog, whom
there we have showed to be the Turk.

Which are the Kings shall come unto his help? Daniel names (beside Egypt
and other places, his slaves and vassals) Lubim and Cushim, that is the
furthest parts of Lybia and Ethiopia. In Ezekiel they are reckoned, the
Persians, Aethiopians, Putaeans (or men of Cyrene) Gomer, and the house of
Togarma, Dan. 11. 43. Ezech. 38. 5. 6. John in the Revelation, Reu. 16. 14.
calls them the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world. And again, Reu.
20. 8. The Nations that are in the four Corners of the earth, whose number is
as the sand of the Sea. Will you now take a muster of all this huge Army, the
General, Soldiers, their preparation, the whole Camp, their on set and
discomfit? read Ezechiel 38. and 39.

Thirdly, The place where they shall so fall: The General because he is a
lofty one, shall fall in as lofty a place as 20 Posit. Place of Gogs Fall.
he, Harmageddon, the mount of delightfulness, Reu. 16. 16. or Hartesby the
mount of Comeliness within the compass of the holy land, Dan. 11. 45. It may
be he shall have the honor to fall at the mount it self, in the valley of
Iehosaphat before Jerusalem or mount Tsion, Joel 3. 2. 12. The Kings with him
shall fall in the same very land, the land of 21 Posit. Place of the armies
discomfit.
Iudaea which they so scorn. But perhaps in some more petty and obscure
places: as it is most like about the Sea of Gennezareth, otherwise called the
lake of Tyberias, Ezech. 39. 11.

4. The time is after many days, Ezechiel does explane 22.
it, Ezec. 38. 7. After many days thou shall be visited, for in the 6 Posit.
Last days.
latter end of the years thou shall come, etc. This therefore after many days
is to be understood the last age in a manner and period of the world wherein we
live upon whom the ends of the world are fallen. The certain time is to be
learnt from other Scriptures, Dan. 12. 11. 12. Revel. 9. 15. which it belongs
not to this place to discuss.

But yet two steps or degrees seem here to be closely 11 Posit. Time of
first conversion.
intimated, one the declining of the Turkish power, when that huge Empire shall
begin to totter and fall, and as it were be held in prison by the hand and
power of God, that they shall not be able to hurt his Church, which shall be
about the year of our Lord, 1650. The other, expressed by the name of visiting
both here, and Ezechiel 38. 7. which for 22 Posit. Time of conquest.
cleerenesse sake we translate, punishing, notes their utter ruin and
overthrow, following some 45. years after the other, as Daniel also does
distinguish them, Dan. 12. 11. 12. See Reu. 9. 15.

Observations.
21. In that day.] 46. The calamities of Gods people are not perpetual: He
chideth not everlastingly, nor reserueth wrath for ever, Psalm. 103. 9.

When their case is most desperate and all humane help fails, then is Gods
help ready at hand for them. As in the 47
deliverance at the red Sea and in many other stories is evident to be seen.

When God has done afflicting of his children by the hand of the wicked and
ungodly, he will cast the rod in 48.
the fire and render affliction to those that afflict us, 2. These. 1. 6. Esaias
10. 5. etc. Woe to Ashur the staff of my wrath, etc, But when the Lord has
accomplished all this work in Mount Tsion, and in Jerusalem, I will visit the
fruit of the greatness of the heart of the King of Babell, and upon the glory
and haughtiness of his eyes.

There is an end and period that God has set to the tyrannle of the wicked,
Psalm. 125. 3. The rod of the wicked 49.
shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, least, etc. The day and certain
time is determined how long it shall be given them to prevail against the
Saints, and then to have an end: He that set the bounds to the raging Sea,
saying, Hither shall thou come and no farther, and here shall the shore set it
self against the pride of thy waves, Job 38. 11. has also set the bounds of
their prevailing.

Visit the host.] 50. There is no strength, no power against the Lord: how
loftily soever the wicked look and how deeply soever they be rooted, Gods
hand will fetch them down, and pluck them up as rotten and unprofitable
branches.

In the lofty place. 51 Yea in their very loftiness he will be as lofty as
they, as good Iethro said of the Egyptians, in that very thing wherein they
were proud, he (Iehoua) was above them: as if he should say, too good for them,
Exodus 18. 11.

The King.] 52. They that will take part and have their hands in the sins of
the wicked, must be content to have a part in their plague and punishment. And
here we see the truth of that which Solomon has in the Proverbs. Let hand
join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished, Prou. 11. 21.

In this very land.] 53 God to abate the pride of the wicked, and that men may
be warned from walking in their steps when they see how much God detesteth the
loftiness of the haughty, punishes them by such base means as they most of
all do scorn. What a thing is it, the Turk and his gallant Princes, his Begs
and Bashawes to fall in the land of Iudaea, a land so base and contemptible in
their eyes?

22. They shall be gathered as a prisoner into a pit, etc.] 54 Oh the patience
of God in bearing with the wicked: he goes even toward them with a leaden
heel to punishment, and that two manner of ways: in the measure, and in the
time. For the measure, first he curbeth and binds their hands from hurting
his Church and people; fettreth their strength and power, and holds them
under bonds: then when that will not profit, he takes all strength away.

He first gives a taste of his power, to show what he is able to do, making
them to totter and decline. But when they go on still in mischief against his
Church, he sweepeth them clean from the face of the earth.

After many days shall be punished. 55. For the time he spares them long,
many days. The Amorites he bare with 400. years after their iniquity was
grown to a great head, because it was not as then fully accomplished. Genesis 15.
16.

Which must make us not despair nor cast off our faith in Gods promises; for
the subversion of the wicked though they be long a coming, Abac. 2. 3. If he
stay, wait for him: Contrary to that, the unbelievers say in Ezechiel, The
days are lengthened, and all vision perishes. Ezech. 12. 22.

For we run by nature headlong in our own desires, and are impatient if God
come not when we would have him. This therefore serves to exercise our faith,
that we faint not in our prayers as we are prone to do. The fault which our
Savior notes, Luke 18. 8. when God comes (in the performance of his promises
and to the succor of his children) shall he find faith upon earth?

23. And the Moon her self shall blush, and the Sun it self be ashamed:
when Jehovah of hoasts shall reign in mount Tsion, and in Jerusalem, and
before his elders, Glory, that is, in glory.
gloriously.

EXPOSITION.
AFter the Turk once destroyed comes the kingdom of Christ to be set up
among the Jews, as it is 23
also certain by Ezechiel, Daniel, and the book of the Revelation, which is
the second degree of their restoring. This Kingdom the holy Ghost does here
describe by the person of the King, the Scepter which he weldeth, the place
where his throne shall be, the form of administration, and the glory of the
kingdom.

The King is Jesus Christ, the Lord of Hosts, Sovereign commander of heaven
and of earth, and of the armies and powers of them both, that nothing can be
lacking to those that have such a King.

The Scepter is his word, the word of the Gospel, whereby he rules and
reigns in the midst of his people; for it is the power of God unto
salvation to every one that believes, Romans 1. 16. The spiritual armor,
powerful and mighty from God to cast down strong holds, and every high thing
exalted against the knowledge of God, as the Apostle speaks, 2. Cor. 10. 4.
Psalm. 110. 2. The rod of thy power will Jehovah send out of Tsion, saying,
Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

The place where his throne shall be, is Tsion and Jerusalem, whether the Jews
shall once again repair: not to 23. Posit. Dwell in their country.
set up the legal ceremonies, but to institute the true spiritual worship and
service of God, Ezech. 36. 24. and 37. 12. 14. 25. Esaias 61. 8.

The form of the Church policy and government, you have pointed at under the
name of Elders. Comprehending 32 Posit. Churches beauty.
Pastors, Teachers, and other governors of the Church.

The glory of the Kingdom shall be so great, that in comparison 31. Posit.
Glorious Church.
of it the Sun and Moon shall cast no light: of the glory thereof read Esaias
54. 11. etc. and 60. 1. 2. 3. 13. etc. Dan. 12. 3. What if by the Sun and
Moon he mean here the Churches of the Gentiles, who shall blush to see
their zeal and love of piety so eclipsed by a far more excellent shining
light.

Observation.
The Church of God, how contemptible soever the world esteem of her, is most
honorable and glorious in 56
the sight of God and men.

The world indeed sees not the honor that Gods Church has, because it is
discerned by faith, and not by sense. Howbeit, such many times is the majesty
of the Church rightly ordered, that the very unfaithful are forced to say, God
is indeed among them, 1. Cor. 14. 25.

This is the Churches glory, that Christ, Iehoua, is her King and Lord. 57


That he reigns and rules in her by the Scepter of his word, and power of
his spirit.

That she is the body of Christ, her Elders and Worthies his members.

All honorable and noble persons.

For whether you consider the outward and true visible members, or the
Catholic and invisible Church of Christ, how honorable and glorious things
must needs be spoken of thee, thou excellent City of God. Psalm. 87. 3. In thee
is seen a body politic, whereunto all other corporations in the world are
but counterfaits. Thy head has a name written upon his thigh, Lord of Lords,
and King of Kings: thy Commons are all Nobles; and thy Nobles, Kings and
Priests: in thee only all virtue is to be found, knowledge, wisdom, piety,
justice, temperance, honor, magnanimity. Thou have a soul as it were, which
other Corporations want, that glueth and knitteth the parts together, one unto
another, and all unto the head. And what is that soul? The quickening Spirit of
Christ, which is God himself that does unite and make thee one with him. Happy
and blessed is he that has his part and fellowship in this incorporation. No
money can buy such a freedom, as Lysias bought the Roman Burgesship. Act. 22.
28. No friends nor favor purchase it, but the only favor of the highest.
Christ alone keeps the keys of the doors of this City. Nay he himself is
the way and the door. By him whosoever enters and is once made free, can
never have that dignity taken from him, but remains a Citizen and free
Burges both here and in heaven for evermore.

All these things, which in their measure and degree are truly and aptly to be
applied to Christ's mystical body wheresoever, do more properly appertain and
in this place are spoken of the glorious Church of the Jews, when the old love
that was between Christ and them in the days of their youth Ier. 31. 2, 3.
shall a fresh be renewed: for which happy and blessed time, it is our part and
duty continually to be suitors, following the steps of their faith and zeal,
who without us thought themselves imperfect. Cantic. 8. 1.

CHAP. 25.
1. O Jehovah thou art my God, I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name, for
thou have done wonderful things: The counsels long ago, are faith, truth.

2. For thou have brought a City unto an heap, a fensed City unto ruin: a
place of strangers, thou have brought to be no more a City, it shall never be
reedified.

3. Therefore shall the mighty people honor thee: the City of the terrible
nations shall fear thee.

4. Because thou have bin a fense to the poor, a fense to the needy in his
distress: a refuge from inundation, a shadow against the heat, when the blast
of the terrible ones was like an inundation of a wall.
an inundation ready to beat down a wall.

5. As heat in a drought, thou have brought down the stir of the strangers:
heat I say with the shadow of a cloud, which heat did answer a life to the
branch of the terrible ones.

EXPOSITION.
THE work of God in casting down the proud tyrants of the world, and thus
magnifying the great name of his Son Christ Jesus, is so great and
wonderful, that the Prophet, as it were rapt beyond himself, is feign to make
a stop or breathing before he come to a further illustration of it; interlacing
both his own private meditations, and the hymn of the whole Church that so
shall be collected.

His own meditation (in the 25th Chapter) has three parts.

The first concerns the fall of these tyrants, which the Prophet divinely
utters in the form of a thanksgiving. Wherein ravished with the
consideration of so marvelous things, he does first break forth into praises,
the praises 1.
of God, the author of this and all other good things. Beginning with the
ground of all, Gods power,

And the covenant with his people,

Afterward he lays down the particular things, for the which Gods name is
so highly to be exalted. And they are,

1. His power, seen in so wonderful a delivery.

2. His truth, whose counsels and decrees long ago foretold and uttered by his
Prophets, are most steadie and constant, and take their due effect.

3. His justice in executing judgment, tumbling down the enemies of Gods
people, notwithstanding all their 2.
might, that they shall be utterly without hope ever to be recovered.

Which the very wicked shall be driven to acknowledge. 3.
Such is the honor that hereby shall redound to his great and holy name, wrung
out of the mouth of sturdie and fierce enemies.

4. His mercy in succouring his poor oppressed 4.
people.

Which is set forth by a double comparison.

In the first, the enemies and oppressors of the Church are compared to raging
waters that carry all before them, hurl down walls and whatsoever else that
stands in their way: God to a place of refuge to fly unto.

In the other, the insolency of these strangers, (the enemies of Gods people)
the stir and ado they make, is resembled 5.
to a heat and drought that does parch and scorch the godly; Gods protection of
his, to a thick shadow. Thou (says he) bring down the noise of the
strangers as heat is slaked in a dry and parched ground: as heat I say is
slaked with the shadow of a thick cloud. which heat answered, and was a life
to the branches and spreading boughs of the violent. That is, served well the
turn, and was most commodious for the wicked, who think their branches spread
and flourish when the godly are scorched with calamities.

Observations.
1. I will] Every child of God has his part and interest in the Churches
good. Which holy and religious persons have preferred and all ought to prefer
before their private wealth, and to be thankful unto God when it goes well
with it. But especially this is the duty of the Ministers of the word. To whom
as God reuealeth more of his will and works then he does to the common sort:
so it is fit they should herein go before others, and be examples to the flock.

Exalt thee] Praises and consequently prayers and petitions are to be made to
God alone. Psalm. 50 15. Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver
thee and thou shall glorify me.

We exalt God when we bless him, and give unto his name the praises due for
the good things we do enjoy. What a mercy it is of so great a Majesty, that
he counts himself to be exalted by any thing that so poor silly worms of
the earth are able to do? And how should this whet our affections, and set an
edge upon us to perform so holy a duty to him?

Thee] In the manifold changes and confusions that fall out in the world, we
must have our recourse to God.

They that have no heart to praise God, it is a token they have never felt how
sweet and gracious he is.

Jehovah, thou art my God:] The foundation of all our prayers and praises of
God stands upon these two grounds and props, his power and his will.

He is able to do us all good. For he is Jehovah Lord of heaven and of earth.
His will we can not doubt of. For he is our God and Father through Christ.

Both these pillars we are taught to rest upon in that holy, heavenly and
peerless prayer, Our Father which art in heaven.

My God] Here is the faith of a Christian, when truly and from his heart in the
sincerity of his soul, he can say with Thomas, Ioh. 20. my God and my Lord:
appropriating to himself the promises of God in Christ. So could not wicked
Saul do, who so often says unto Samuel, Jehovah thy God. 1 Samuel 15. 21, 30. as
being himself none of his. This makes our faith differ from the faith of
Devils, and from the faith of all carnal Gospellers.

For thou have done] The mighty and memorable acts of God deserve and are most
worthy always to be had in remembrance: for he has so wrought his wonderful
works, that he has purchased a memorial for them, says the Psalmist. Psalm.
111. 4. They that are negligent and forgetful, make God, as much as lies in
them, to loose this purchase: which can never be. Wherefore it is a thing too
too intolerable (though nothing be more common in the world) for men to be so
attentive to their own private affairs, that they never heed the glorious
acts of God, which he every day shows forth in the world for men to behold
(as in a glass) his glory in them.

Whereunto we are directed by our Prophet, and a door (as it were) and window
here set open: things pointed at, which we must open our eyes to see. For as
the Apostle writes to the Romans, Romans 1. the invisible things of God are
manifested in them. His power, truth, wisdom, justice, majesty and mercy.

Wonderful things] When we see strange and marvelous things, wonderful in
our eyes, incredible to flesh and blood; there is the finger of God, his power,
and his might.

Councels long ago] When we find the same long before, many ages past,
prophesied and foretold, as purposed from eternity, not suddenly and by chance
rushed into: what a providence and care is this over his Church and people?
what a depth of wisdom in so ordering and disposing of them?

Are faith, truth.] When his promises so long waited for and expected, come in
due time to be performed, there is his faithfulness and truth. To teach us not
to faint nor cast off our faith and confidence; but though he linger yet to
wait. For coming he will come and will not defer. Abacuc. 2. 3.

2. For thou have brought a City etc.] When we see mighty Nations, strong and
fensed Cities, that lend the arm of their strength and power to the oppressing
of Gods people, to have their horns broken and to be laid even with the
ground, that there remains not so much as a shard to fetch one cole of fire
in, a ruin never to be repaired; behold a moment of his justice.

3. The mighty people, the terrible nations.] What a God must we needs say is
this of majesty and glory, that wringeth out of the mouth of the wicked and
ungodly a confession of his praises? and makes the false-hearted tyrants, that
have been so awful and terrible to his people, to counterfeit a subjection,
and will they, nill they, to do his Church service. Esaias 60. 14.

4. Thou have been a fense to the poor, etc.] When the hearts of his poor
distressed servants, in the midst of their heaviness and sorrows, receive
abundance of comfort, are kept as it were in the Lions den, and in the
midst of the hot burning furnace, that God is as a wall of brass round about
to guard and to defend them: lo the riches of his mercy and goodness. And this
makes a high and mighty wall of difference between profane worldlings and
Gods children. For even they are amazed many times at the wonderful things
that God brings to pass in the government of the world. But none can indeed
profit by the works of God, but such as have their eyes opened to behold the
things before remembered.

When the blast:] God is a help in affliction very ready to be found: when all
humane forces fail, the divine power is most at hand. He suffers his own
that are most dear unto him to be iustled to the walls, yea to be as an old
and tottering wall, ready to be ouer-turned with the blasts and violence of
the wicked, as the Church complains in the Psalms. Psalm. 66. 12. Thou have
made men to ride over our heads. But in the mean time he has the bridle and
holds the reins in his own hands to curb and keep them in, when they
would go too far, pass the metes and bounds that he has set them.

Then comes his help as we say in the nike, most sweet and comfortable, as
the shadow is to one that walks and trauelleth in the heat of the day when
the Sun scorcheth most.

5. Thou have brought downe] God is he that brings down the rage and fury
of the wicked, and for all the stir and ado they keep, stilleth and quieteth
the waves of their haughty and restles Spirits that they can do his Church no
hurt. Many a time have they afflicted me even from my youth, may Israel now
say. Many a time have they afflicted me even from my youth, but could not
praeuaile against me. Psalm. 129. 1, 2.

Which did answer:] We must look whilst we are in this world to be maliced of
the wicked and ungodly. They love a life, and it is meat and drink unto them
to see Gods people buffeted and tormented: as the Edomites did. which the
Prophet reprehendeth in them, Obadia verse. 12. and the Church complains of in
the Psalms, Psalm. 137. 7. So has there always bin in the world a perpetual
and trucelesse war between the seed of the woman, and the seed of the the
serpent: Kain that was of the wicked one, and Abel the righteous, the sons of
God and the children of men, figured in Rebecca, a type of the Church, in whose
womb two nations were divided, and the children rushed and dashed one against
another. That as within we have a battle, the spirit striving and fighting
against the flesh; so without we have the world that rages and maligneth us.

The reason is, because our losses they take to be their own gain, and think
themselves can never prosper, shout out, nor flourish so long as the godly hold
up their head, Ezech. 26. 2, Because Tyrus says of Jerusalem, ha, ha, the City
of populous gates is broken, it is turned over to me, I shall be filled, now
she is wasted. Again, Ezech 36. 2. Because the enemy says of you (of the
children of Israel) ha, ha, and the everlasting high places shall become an
inheritance unto me.

6. And Iehoua of hoasts will make unto all people in this mountain, a feast
of fat things, a feast of wine in the lees: of fat things, full of marrow, of
wine in the lees, fined.

7. And he will swallow up in this mountain The face of the veil: for the
vail of the face, alluding to the vail that Moses put upon his face. A figure
that is called hypallage.
the veil of the face, the veil, that is, upon all these people: and the
covering that is spread upon all these nations.

8. He will swallow up death it self unto victory, and the Lord Iehoua will
wipe away all tears from all faces: and the rebuke of his people will he take
away out of all the land, for Iehoua has spoken it.

EXPOSITION.
THE second part of the meditation is the larges of Gods goodness to his
people the Jews professing Christ: to whom he will make a great and most
sumptuous banquet, a banquet magnified and royally set forth by the master of
the feast, the guests that shall be invited, his Court where he keeps his
board, the cheer and the several dishes to be served to the table.

The Master of the feast is Jehovah of Hoasts. Such an Ordinary can none keep
but he. Nor is there power in any 6
to give virtue and foison to those dishes to feed and cheer up our lean and
hungry souls but in God alone.

The guests are all those people of the Jews, to wit, Judah 8 Posit. X, Tribes.
and the Tribes of Israel that cleave to him, Joseph where Ephraim had the
pre-eminence and the Tribes of Israel that cleave to him, Ezech. 37. 16. etc.
The calling therefore of the Jews shall be general and universal, of the X.
Tribes as well as of the other, Hoshea 1. 11. Ier. 3. 12. 18. Romans 11. 26.

This standing table shall be kept in Mount Tsion: the 23. Posit. Dwell in
their country.
Mount he spoke of before, chap. 24. 22. really and spirituallie the true
Church of Christ gathered of the Jews, returned into their own country. None
that come not thither shall taste of those delights.

But what are the dainties and Iunketting dishes that shall be served in?
Generally, fat things and wine, not of the 36 Posit. Spiritual graces.
ordinary and common sort, but fat things marrowed, as the Hebrew word is, not
only full of marrow, but picked, as it were, and culled out of the heart of
marrow: Wine, first in the lees, that keeps the smell, the taste and vigor,
as Ier. 48. 11. Next of the finest and the best: by all which I understand
first and principally Christ himself, the true food of our souls, whose flesh
is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed: the bread that came down from
heaven, and gives life unto the world. In the second place are meant the rich
graces of the spirit that God does bountifully bestow upon the Saints by the
preaching of the Gospel: sweeter to the soul then marrow and wine is to the
taste: as Esaias 55. 1. 2. and which then after a more special manner he shall
endow his own people with.

The several services, take them one by one, and see how they do excel. 7.


1. Is the taking away of the hardness of their hearts, of 5. Posit. Call.
the cover and mantell that now is spread over all these people and nations of
the Jews, the blindness and ignorance that possesses them which shall then
be done away, when their heart shall turn unto the Lord. So does Paul
explicate this place, 2. Cor. 3. 13. 14. 15. which makes me rather to apply
the general word, all people, to the Jews only; as it is taken, Zach. 10. 11.
then to the fullness of the Gentiles, who upon their Call shall submit
themselves to Christ.

2. The happiness of this new people shall be as if they were risen again,
life from the dead, Romans 11. 15. So clear 8.
and evident demonstration shall there be in them of the 39 Posit. Prosperity.
last resurrection, nay of the second death swallowed up in victory, and
conquered for ever, no more to domineere over those that Christ admits to
his table.

3. All inward heaviness and outward calamities shall from thenceforth cease.
Turk nor other Tyrant shall not have power to oppress them, or the holy truth
of God which they profess. They shall have joy and peace in the holy Ghost. So
the revelation, chap. 21. 4. applying it to these times, does teach us to
expound it.

All which things so wonderful and incredible, are shut up with this, to
procure faith and credit, that the Lord has spoken it.

Observations.
6. And etc.] The great and excellent things that Christ bestows upon his,
are most sweet and comfortable, compared to a feast; a feast of most dainty and
delicate things: for there are not only the Word and Sacraments, whereby he
feeds his outwardly, but abundance of inward graces of the Spirit, more
delightful to the soul then any meat or drink can be unto the body. This
is figured in the Law by the Table standing in the Tabernacle.

Christ makes one and the same banquet unto all, Mat. 22.)

Howbeit, as men entertain more honorable guests with greater magnificence
then others, so this sumptuous banquet here prepared is specially for the
Jews. The same dishes and services have all his children: but here more
exquisite plenty and variety, a greater riches of Spiritual and heavenly
treasures.

Iehoua will make.] God is the author of our heavenly vocation, he makes the
feast, inuiteth the guests, etc. Worthily he is called the Lord of Hoasts that
does it, for it is a Divine work and virtue to draw men to this banquet.
Though the meat set before them be most sweet and delicate, daintier then the
sweetest spices fetch from India or Arabia; yet men had rather like swine to
devour swilles and husks, then to feed at the Lords table.

To all people.] There is none that Christ refuses, he bids all to come
unto him, Math. 11. 28. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and
I will refresh you. No sex, no age, no condition or sort of men does he
reject: wherefore men's unworthiness ought not to keep them back. Here the
hungry is satisfied, the poor and empty soul refreshed.

In this mountain.] But this banquet is to be had in the Church of God only,
like to the table that stood in the Sanctuary. Thither we must repair if we
desire to taste of such pleasures. This is the privilege of Gods people. The
great ones of the world shall be hunger-starued, when they are full fed.

7. And he will swallow up the veil of the face.] The elegies and noble
commendations of the doctrine of the Gospel.

1. As the rising of the Sun it scatters the mists of error and darkness,
whereby we are also taught that there is nothing in us but ignorance and
blindness till the doctrine of the Gospel give us light.

8. He will swallow up death.] 2 We are freed from the terror and fear of
death, the second death which so fretteth and gnaweth the natural man, all
that are not in Christ, Heb. 2. 15.

Yea and we have life bestowed upon us: life that comprehends all pleasures.

Not only so, but even life eternal; for death is swallowed up in victory: and
having Christ who is life it self, how is it possible we should ever die?

Iehoua will wipe away all tears.] 3 It ministers joy in the holy Ghost,
heavenly and spiritually, Acts 8.

When Philip came to Samaria and preached unto them Christ, there was much joy
in that City. He that finds this treasure, for joy thereof will sell all he
has to buy it, Math. 13. Exceeding great cause there is of this joy: for being
once set free from death and condemnation, assured of the love of God in
Christ, of peace and reconciliation through him, and of forgiveness of sins
in his blood, needs must it make even the lame to skip like a hind, and the
tongue of the dumb to sing, Esaias 35. 6.

9. And he shall say in that day, lo, this is our God, we have waited for him;
and he has saved us. This is Iehoua, whom we have waited for, we will rejoice
and be glad for his salvation.

10. For the hand of Iehoua shall rest in this mountain, and Moab shall be
threshed under him, as straw is threshed unto dung.

11. For he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of him, as he that
swimmeth, spreads themforth to swim: and be shall bring down his pride
with the bars of his hands.

12. And the fense, the height of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low,
cast unto the ground, even unto the dust.

EXPOSITION.
THe third part of the meditation, is the exaltation and rejoicing of Gods
people, lifting up their head: and 5 Posit. Call.
first 9.
by patheticall acclamations applauding the approach of Christ their God and
Lord, whom they had so long been without: as the Cherubins did, Ezech. 10. 5.

After rejoicing at the fall of the enemies of Gods Church, beaten all to
pieces by the hand and power of 10
18 Posit. Conquest.
God, as straw is beaten to dung.

Which hand and power of God subduing all things unto 11.
himself, is declared by a most sweet similitude taken from those that swim.
God, says he, will stretch out his hands amidst his foes (understood by the
Moabites) as they are by the Edomites in this very argument, Esaias 63. 1.) as a
man stretches them out in the water to swim: and with the bars of his hands,
that is, with his large and mighty hands will keep down the pride of his
rebellious foes, even as the raging waters are stilled and kept down with
bars, and other things set against them.

And then with variety of words heaped together with 12.
one breath, is the certainty, the speediness and greatness of the overthrow
declared.

Observations.
9. He shall say, lo this.] How sweet a thing it is to find Christ when he
has been long missing?

We have waited.] The patient expectation of the Saints shall not be deceived
for ever.

God indeed many times does exercise them long. They look again and again,
that their eyes go out, their heart faints, and their strength is all spent in
looking after him, but at the length he is found of them.

And then are we filled with endless comfort, for he saves out of all
troubles, from hell, death, and the power of darkness.

10. The hand of Jehovah shall rest in this mountain.] The Church of God is as
it were his armory where his hand and power, all the weapons of his warrefare
are laid up in store. Thence he plucketh it out for the defense of his people,
and the offense of his foes. And if when he does but hide his strength, he be
most terrible and frightfull, Abac. 3. 4. what shall we think he is, when
with his bare hand and naked arm he fetches a full stroke?

And Moab.] The most pestilent enemies of his Church cannot escape the blows
that he will give.

11. For he shall spread.] All their force and power cannot free them: when
like the mighty waves and surges of the sea they rise, lift up their voice, and
make a noise; he sets more gloriously aloft, Psalm. 93. 3. 4. the bars of
his hands can easily keep them under.

12. And the fense.] Though their walls be fenced up to heaven, he has
means enough to pull them down, and to lay them even with the earth. Cease
we therefore from man whose breath is in his nostrill, for wherein is he to
be esteemed? Esaias 2. 22.

CHAP. 26.
1. In that same day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: we have a
strong City, salvation does God set for walls and bulwarks.

2. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation may enter in, which keeps
Faiths.
all faith.

3. To a frame stayed, thou will preserve peace, peace because he trusts in
thee.

EXPOSITION.
IN this 26th chapter is the Hymn or Song of thanksgiving, which the whole
Church of the Jews shall sing to the honor and praise of God for so
wonderful a mercy received at his hands. It has first four circumstances
going before, and then as many parts.

Circumstances,

1. Of the time, in that day.

2. The form, by a song. 1.


3. It shall be a public song, as men and women and all the people did when
God brought them out of Egypt, Exodus 15.

4. This song shall be sung not in the wilderness as the 23. Posit. Dwell in
their country.
other was, but in the land of Judah in their own native country, and of the
Jews wonderfully brought home thither.

The parts of the song (as I said) are four.

First, the Churches triumph; glorying of Gods goodness toward her both in the
whole body and in the particular members.

In the whole body for the strength and stabilitie of the 42 Posit. Stabilitie.
Jewish Synagogue now converted unto Christ, God has set his saving health as
a rampire and a bulwark round about her walls, that not her most deadly and
cruel enemy, shall any more prevail against her. So they verify that which
you read Psalm. 46. 2. and 48. 4.

In her members she notes four things.

First, the number and the multitude, that all the gates 2.
are little enough to let them in. For which see Esaias 49. 12, 38 Posit.
Multitude of believers.
18, 19, 20, 21. and 54. 2, 3.

Secondly, the means, which is to set wide open the ports and gates. Literally
and really, of Jerusalem or the land of Judah, that they may come thick and
threefold thither from all places without check or controlment, as Esaias does
exhort, Esaias 62. 10. Pass on by the gates, praepare the way of the people.
Lift up, lift up a cawsey, take away the stones, lift up the banner for the
people. Spiritually to open the gates of the Church by the ministry and
preaching of the Gospel, that the subjects of the King of glory may come in;
multitudes of their brethren the Jews to flock every day to the Lords
Assemblies. All this by an Apostrophe or turning of the speech to those
doore-keepers the Lords Remembrancers.

Thirdly, are mustered their heavenly and spiritual 36 Posit. Spiritual graces.
graces: five in number.

1. Righteousness, both imputed and renewed.

2. Faith, which is the hand or instrument whereby they apprehend this
righteousness of God in Christ, and make themselves true owners and possessors
of it. Wherein the better to express the measure of their faith, he calls it
faiths in the plural, as Peter has godlinesses. 2 Pet. 3. 11. The same
perhaps which Paul in another case expresses by the name of all faith. 1 Cor.
13. 2.

3. Constancy and perseverance in this grace: wrestling for the faith, as Jude
speaks, verse. 3. And holding of it fast, which was the Apostles rejoicing. 2 Timothy 4. 7. I have kept the faith.

4. The ground of all this, a new birth. To a frame, says he, (a heavenly
frame, one framed and fashioned 3.
from above, that of a wild Ass colt is made a man, by spiritual
regeneration, as Tsophar speaks in the book of Job. Job 11. 12.) Thou do
reserve. etc.

5. Trust and confidence, with all ones heart, soul and thoughts resting and
relying upon the power of God in Christ; upon his strengthening and
corroborating Spirit, into whose hands God has committed all things, that it
is impossible any should perish that betake themselves to him. For all our
endeauours are able to do nothing. It is God alone by whom we are guarded,
walled in and fensed unto salvation. 1 Pet. 1. 5.

The fourth remarkable thing in this part, is the happiness 39 Posit.
Prosperity.
and felicity which God bestows upon his people thus furnished and fitted of
heavenly graces; peace, peace, all manner of good things, so far as is for
their good. Which first shall be most plentiful and abundant, then constant
and perpetual: not reserved only and laid up in store, but kept and preserved
firm for evermore, by him that is the surest and most faithful keeper. But
this peace especially comprehends peace of conscience, that passes
understanding, and is a continual feast to those that have it. So does the
Prophet express in this place, that which the Apostle writes to the Romans,
Romans 14. 17. The kingdom of God is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost.

Observations.
1. In that day:] The time of Gods mercies ought to be the time of our
thanksgiuings. We are not to take day for it.

Song] Hereunto we must stir up our selves by all good means to quicken our
dulnes, and to set an edge upon our praises and thanksgiuings, using Psalms,
Hymns, and spiritual Songs. For the voice and melodious tune is fit to stir
up the affections of the heart, and to beget much spiritual and inward joy.

So shall we use holily and aright the things that God has given for the
comfort and solace of our life.

In the land] Public benefits are publicly and of all to be acknowledged:
Herewith is God well pleased, when a whole Nation lifts up their voice
topraise God for mercy in common appertaining to them all.

Of Iehuda:] The Church only is capable of this duty. Profane men and
worldlings like swine receive many blessings, but never look up to the hand
that gave them. Of the 10 Lepers that were healed, only one returned to give
glory unto God. Luke 17.

2. A strong] The Church of God is of invincible strength and power. Hell gates
cannot prevail against it.

To vs] This is for the comfort of all the faithful. For the promises made to
it, extend to all the members, citizens of the same. And thus must we learn,
to apply to our own good, whatsoever we find written of the Church or of
those that dwell therein.

God has set] But this strength neither Church nor any member have of
themselves or by their own in herent virtue. All comes from Gods grace and
power only. We are weak and silly worms to encounter with so great and
mighty foes as fight against us on every side: It is he that does set his
fense about us, and guards our walls and bulwarks. Psalm. 60. 14. Through God we
shall do valiantly, and he treads down our foes.

Saluations:] We need not fear in anything. For it it is not slight and small
succors we have from him. Saluations, all manner of health and safety he does
minister: If one help will not do it, he is ready with an other. Satan can
not have so many means to foylevs, as He has means to keep and hold us up.

2. Open] The preaching of the Gospel is the gate to let in Gods people into
the Church, and to make them Citizens of the beauenly Tsion. Romans 10. Faith
comes by hearing.

This gate must be unlocked and kept wide open by the Ministers, to whom God
has committed the keys of the house of David to open and to shut.

For they are set as upon a watch-towre to keep out enemies, that the true
Citizens may come in.

Wherefore a continual diligence and attendance is to be looked for of such,
that night and day they stand upon their watch. As that faithful watchman
professes of himself he did. Esaias 21. 8.

How much are they to blame that neglect so holy a duty imposed of God upon
them?

May enter in] But as they are thus carefully to attend, so it is the peoples
part to lie at this door: as the multitude did at the poole of Bethesda. Ioh.
5. ready to go in with the first entrance that they find. David, Psalm. 110.
3. writing of these very times, when Gods people shall be won to Christ,
shows what ardencie and zeal shall be in them, to enter in at these gates.
Thy people shall flock most willingly in the day of thy troops, in the comely
places of holiness, even from the womb, from the morning, to thee shall
flock the dew of thy youth.

Righteous] The badge and liuerie of Gods people is righteousness and
holiness, whereby as by a coguisance, men may know the Master whom they
serve: for this praise belongs to them alone. And here is a true definition
of the Church of God, and of their lively members. Whatsoever fair virtues are
to be seen among the worldlings, it is but a gloss that quickly fades, an
outside only that never takes root.

Faith] For lacking faith, that only purifieth the heart, Act. 15. 9. it is
impossible that they should have any sound or solid virtue.

The righteousness of faith is the only true righteousness. In vain do men
seek for righteousness, where it can not be had, as Pharisees and Iustitiaries
do in their own perfections. For which cause the Apostle rejects the Jews
in his time from being the Church of God. Romans 10. 3. Seeking to set up their
own righteousness, they have not been subject to the righteousness of God.
But when God will give them an other heart, they shall then grow wiser to
acknowledge that Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believes: and that the righteous by faith not by his own works shall
live. Abacuc. 2. 4.

Keeping] This faith we must continually strive and wrestle for: as Satan
never cease to shake and to oppugn it. The children of God are fair marks
for him to level at and to cast all his darts against. So much the more
therefore it behooves us to labor and to use all good and holy means that we
suffer not so precious a possession to be taken from us.

Faiths.] Not one jot or tittle of the faith is to be lost. Not a hoof, as
Moses said, Exodus 10. 26. to be parted with. Grow we must from faith to faith,
but not fall or decline in any point.

3. A frame] Regeneration or a new birth is the noble fruit of faith. Ioh. 1.
12. To them that believed, he gave this dignity to be the sons of God; who
are borne not of the flesh etc. And as it is the fruit of faith: So it is the
root and mother grace of all other virtues: which do all flow from hence as
rivers from a fountain or waters from the Sea. This regeneration is a new
frame or mould that God casts his into, forming and fashioning them again,
as the Potter does the clay; when of a base and unserviceable vessel, putting
it into the fire, he frames it into an other fashion, and makes it to serve
for high and honorable uses.

Stayd] Which being the work of God, a heavenly and supernatural work, is
stablisht from above, that it can never perish and come to nothing: for the
seed of God abiding in them, stays and holds them up, that they can never
fall away. It is impossible he should ever sin in such sort, as to deface the
image that God has put upon him. 1 Ioh. 5. 18. He that is borne of God,
keeps himself that the wicked one can not touch him.

Because he trusts in thee] For resting and staying himself upon the
strength of him who is the everlasting rock, he stands more firm then mount
Tsion, which can not be removed, but remains fast for ever.

Having this for his comfort, that to him belong the promises of all and all
manner of blessings, spiritual and temporal, never to be taken from him so
long as he takes not off his hold to trust and depend on God.

4. Trust ye in Jehovah, for evermore: for in Jehovah is a rock of eternity.

5. For he has brought down the inhabitants of a high place the lofty City:
he has abased it, he has abased even unto the ground, he has brought it even
unto the dust.

6. The foot has trampled it down: the feet of the poor, the steps of the
needy.

7. The path of the just one, with all rightnesses.
rightnes: with an equal balance, the tracke of the just one do thou peize.

EXPOSITION.
THe second part of the Hymn is an exhortation, flowing from the former
doctrine, for all Gods people to 4.
put their trust in him. In regard both of his power and his Justice. His power
manifested in the Church. In that he is a rock for their defense. And an
everlasting rock that never fails at any assay. Esaias 4. 10.

Toward the wicked he declares that his power by tumbling down the lofty
and laying them in the dust. 5.
Which is notably amplified by the poor and silly means 6.
that God does use for the effecting of so glorious a work. 18 Posit. Conquest.


1. The base and abject nation of the Jews, to abate the pride of the high and
lofty.

2. What are the weapons that these people fight withal? Not the hands wherein
one strength lies, but their feet. And how? feet against a City, a lofty
and an high exalted City. No otherwise then men deal with base and pezantlie
fellows, as Sampson that spurned the Philistims with his foot against their
sides, and made a great slaughter of them. Judge. 15. 8.

The justice of God is evident to be seen, in that he tempereth all things,
both prosperity and adversity, to his 7.
children, in a most just and equal sort: more euenly then with any weight or
balance.

Observation.
5. For he has brought down etc.] God casts down the proud, and exalts
the humble. His right hand makes great changes. Psalm. 77. 11. There is no
strength, no counsel can stand against him. Prove. 21. 30, 31. That as the
Psalmist says, The rebellious, let them not exalt themselves. Psalm. 66. 7. See
the Virgins song, Luke 1. and the song of Anna, 1 Samuel 2. both notable to this
purpose.

6. The feet etc.] It is his pleasure and his wisdom to use to this end,
vile, base, and abject means, for bringing of mighty and wonderful things to
pass. Desolation it self to be able to scale a fort. Amos 5. 10. men thrust
through to rise up and set whole Cities a fire. Ier. 37. 10. the feet and
toes, as it is in this place, and that of poor and needy ones, to spurn
down fensed places.

The use and benefit we are to make hereof is double: first, that as he said to
Gedeon, Judge. 7. 2. men take not honor to themselves, to say, my right hand
has done it; nor with the King of Babell to sacrifice to our nets. Abac. 1.
16. but to ascribe the whole power to him, to whom it is only due.

2. It teaches us, when we are at our wits end, brought to the greatest
straits, that we know not which way to turn us: yet to fly to him, and to
repose our whole trust and confidence in his strength and virtue. For when the
help of man does most fail, then is his help most at hand. Man's extremities
are Gods opportunity.

7. The path etc. with all rightnes] Herein lies a great part of our
spiritual wisdom, to behold Gods just and righteous dealing, in those very
things wherein the world is most to seek. For when all things go well with
those that fear God, when wicked persons, the tyrants of the world, are beaten
down and recompensed according to their works: then it is an easy thing even
for profane men to say, Surely there is a God that judges the earth. Psalm.
58. 12.

But when the righteous are driven to the wall, and the wicked prosper and
flourish, spread their boughs, and are green like the Bay tree: then men, yea
Gods own children begin to call in question, either the wisdom of God, to
say, How does God know? is there knowledge in the most high? Ps. 72. 11. or his
Justice, as if in vain we had purified our hearts or washed our hands in
innocence. Psalm. 72. 13. Wherefore it is an excellent thing to stop our
mouths, and stoop unto his dealings: which, though we see not the reason, are
always just and holy, yea iuster and more even then the Goldsmiths balance,
even then when he seems most to forget his promises, and to leave his dear
and faithful children to the rage of their oppressors.

8. Yea in the path of thy judgments, o Jehovah, did we wait for thee: to
thy name and to the memorial of thee, was the desire of our soul.

9. With my soul have I desired thee in the night, yea with my spirit within
me have I sought thee early: for when as thy judgments are in the earth, the
inhabitants of the world do learn righteousness.

10. Let favor be showed to the wicked, he will not learn righteousness, in
the land of all equity he will do wickedly; and will not see the excellency
of Jehovah.

11. O Jehovah, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not behold: they shall
behold and blush for the zeal of the people
toward the people, yea the fire shall consume those very enemies of thine.

EXPOSITION.
THE third part of the Hymn is the Churches confession or profession rather,
made to God, what has been the carriage of the godly ones, the poor remnant
that wait for the promise of their restoring, all the while 3 Posit. Remnant.
Gods hand lay so heavy on them: which is the state and condition of the Jews
at this present in the midst of their great calamity and affliction.

First, is their patient depending upon God and trust in him. 8.


The props of which their trust in God, are his name, that is to say, the
meditation of his truth, justice, power; and the memory of him, in the
meditation of his word and works and other holy exercises. Psalm. 111. 4.

This meditation is set forth doubly, by the earnestness and the continuance
of it. The earnestness in two words, 9.
soul and spirit: the continuance in two other, night and morning,
comprehending the whole day long. See Psalm. 63. 2.

The second thing they profess, is their profiting by afflictions in
righteousness and true holiness. For affliction indeed is a bitter root, but
it brings forth most sweet fruit, the fruit of righteousness, to them that
are exercised thereby, Heb. 12. 11.

By the inhabitants of the world, I take Gods children, specially to be meant,
because of the opposition following, to wit.

The contrary carriage of the wicked and ungodly, whom no rods can tame, no
chastisement or correction, though 10
never so just and equal, yea merciful and gracious, bring to their right
senses, to see and acknowlede the excellent and mighty work of God: for the
wicked are never a whit the better for all Gods dealings. His mild and gentle
courses do not mollify, but convince them.

But yet, mauger their head, they shall be driven both to see and to
acknowledge to their shame, the great and mighty 11.
hand of God, his zeal for his people, and the fire of his wrath to consume
his foes.

Observations.
8. In the path.] Chastisements and afflictions are the path which Gods
children are to walk in. You know (says the Apostle, 1. These. 3.) that we
were ordained hereunto. And again, through the midst of affliction we must
make our way unto Gods Kingdom, Act. 14. The passage of Gods children is
through straight and difficult places: and the lines that lead to the center
of our rest are directly drawn from the circumference of troubles and
distresses. Christ the circle of our happiness did paue that way to heaven,
and was feign himself with his own feet to tread it, before he could enter
into his glory.

Thy judgments.] When God does chastise us, we are to consider that he sits
in his throne of judgment. He that is the righteous Judge, Psalm. 10. the
Judge of all the world, that cannot but do justice, Genesis 18. 25. which must
make us to subscribe to his sentence, and to profit by afflictions, humbling
our souls before him.

Wait.] To keep us that we faint not under this burden, there is none so
sure an anchor to fly unto as the hope and expectation of Gods mercies: which
was the comfort Iaakob took when he beheld with the eyes of faith the promises
of God in the midst of those great calamities that were to befall his
posterity, O Iehoua, I have waited for thy salvation, Genesis 49. 18. And David in
the Psalms, Psalm. 40. 2. Waiting, I have waited for Iehoua.

To thy name.] Which that we may the better do, he has not left us destitute
of excellent means and helps, as wine and apples to refresh our senses. First
we have his name: his name is himself, and all the virtues that are in him,
Esaias 30. 27. Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from a far, as if he should
say, God whose Majesty is most famous, will then come when in judgment of man
he seems to be farthest off, to deliver his, and to destroy his enemies. Who
shall be punished, says Paul, 2. These. 1 from the presence of God; that is, of
God himself present to their terror: What can bring more content then to have
him on our side?

And to thy memory.] But because not only to flesh and blood, but in the
opinion also of the faithful (carried with humane weakness and infirmity)
he seems many times to absent himself, and to hide his face from us:
therefore in the second place the very memory of his name does bring most sweet
content, when we call to mind the promises of his Word, his former mercies,
the experience we have had of his goodness.

The desire of our soul.] The meditation of these things must be sweet unto
our soul. No woman with child to long more after any thing she lusts for,
then we to long after the comforts which the consideration of the power,
wisdom, goodness, Justice, and mercy of God, and the sweet exercises of his
word do bring us: As the Heart brayeth after the rivers of waters, so does my
soul for thee O God, says the Prophet in the Psalms, Psalm. 84.

9. With my soul, etc. with my spirit.] Our whole soul, and all our
affections, our memory, judgment, conscience and understanding must be carried
with all eagerness, and be as forward in good things, as the wicked are in
evil; who from their heart, and with all their soul rejoice to commit evil,
Ezech. 25. 6.

In the night, etc. I early seek thee.] Yea we must lie at these things night
and day, never to let the remembrance of them go out of our mind. It is a
goodthing (says the Psalmist, Psalm. 92. 3.) to publish thy kindness in the
morning, and thy truth in the nights.

For when, etc.] Great is the need we have of these ferulaes and corrections.
The flesh is so strong even in the best, the work of Gods grace so weak, that
his faithful children have need of many beatings and buffetings to tame and to
subdue it.

Learn righteousness.] And this is the right use we are to make of Gods
chastisements and corrections, to learn thereby righteousness. Christ
himself by the things he suffered, learnt obedience, Heb. 5. 8. What need then
have we to be trained up in this school, and to take out that lesson which
cost the Son of God so dear?

10. Let favor, etc.] Do we marvel if all this do the wicked no good at
all? Why, it is true, in Gods Children the flesh indeed lusts against the
Spirit and is not easily brought into subjection: wherefore they also have
much need to be kept under.

But in the wicked it is far other. They had need not to be chastised and
corrected, but to be beaten and ground to pieces; for nothing will reclaim and
bring them home. All Gods gracious and merciful dealing sinketh no whit into
them, even when things go as they would have them, with an even and a fair
current, that they can take no exception to, when they enjoy most their hearts
ease, they cease not to offend and provoke God unto his face.

And consider not.] For they look not to the hand from whom they have all
those good things, esteeming it either chance and fortune, or that their own
arm has procured them that happiness. They think of any thing rather than
of the true cause indeed, Gods bounty and goodness, his high and mighty
outstretched arm, their deliverances to come from him, he to be the author
and fountain of all blessings.

11. O Iehoua] A wonderful thing, and much to be admired (which causes the
Prophet to turn his speech, and to make his moan to God) that men should be
so like buzzards, blind as Moales, not to see the hand of God so high and
glorious, so lifred up and exalted.

They shall see.] But will they, nill they, they shall have their eyes opened
to see and be ashamed. Gods justice shall be so evident, his uprightness and
equal proceeding so manifest in the world, as shall stop the mouth of all his
foes: yea, to their vexation two things shall before their eyes torment them,
Gods zeal and love unto his Church, his hatred of the wicked, and his wrath
that shall burn them up.

God, though he bear and for bear long, yet is tender hearted to his people,
and jealous of their good.

Zeal, etc, Fire.] Contrariwise, he has wrath in store for the wicked and
ungodly: their end shall be lamentable, howsoever for a while they look aloft,
and hold up their heads. Both these are notably expressed, Zachary 1. 14. 15.

Thine enemies.] Here is an excellent comfort to Gods children, that their
enemies God esteems his: as he says to Abraham, I will curse them that curse
thee. What need we then to fear them when they do nothing to us, but God
takes it as done to him: and who ever hardened himself against God, and made
his party good? Job 9. 4.

12. O Iehoua, thou will ordain peace for us: Also our affairs thou have
wrought for us.

13. O Iehoua our God, Lords besides thee have mastred us: only through thee
do we make mention of thy name.

14. They dead shall not live, deceased, shall not rise: therefore thou have
visited and cut them off, and destroyed all the memory of them.

15. Thou have added to this Nation, O Iehoua, thou have added to this Nation
life glorifying thy self: whom thou did remove far off unto all the ends
of the earth.

16. O Iehoua, in trouble they visited thee: they powered out submisse prayer,
when thy chastisement was upon them.

17. Like as a woman with child that draws near to travel, is in pain,
cries out in her pangs: so have we been at thy sight, O Iehoua.

18. We were with child, we were in pain, we did as it were bring forth
wind: Helps could we not have done.
no help could we have done in the land, neither should the inhabitants of
the world have fallen.

19. Thy dead men shall live, my carcass they shall every one of them arise:
awake thou savest and sing, ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the dew of
herbs, after thou have made men fall dead upon the ground.

EXPOSITION.
THe fourth part of the Hymn is a magnifying of God 12
for their delivery, ascribing the whole glory unto him alone, the only Author
both of their peace, and of the means whatsoever was needful for the
procuring of it.

Which is amplified, first by the Lordlinesse of the Tyrants 13.
keeping them so under, that it must needs be the only work of God, to enable
them to be in case to remember his name, and to return praise unto him for the
accomplishment of his promises.

Secondly, by consideration of the power and mercy of God, raising them from so
low estate. Set out by a noble 14.
Antithesis or opposition of the work of God toward those tyrants, and unto
these his own children: they once down shall never rise again, nor their name
be ever heard of. For Gog and Magog shall utterly be subverted, Revel. 20. 9.
10.

This Nation, the Nation of the Jews, brought to so 15.
low an ebb, shall have life more and more heaped upon them to Gods praise and
glory. In such wonderful manner that they do as it were clap their hands for
joy to think upon it, which the Hebrew notably expresses, so as no other
language can reach unto.

Thirdly by comparing the former miseries with their 4 Posit. Disolation.
great deliverance, the more to set forth the riches of Gods mercy.

We were (say they) driven into the furthest parts of the earth: as what Nation
is there in the world which I say not has not heard, but has not seen and
felt the misery of their dispersion.

2. We were in extreme anguish and heaviness, which wrung from us tears and
submisse prayers, one excellent fruit of affliction.

No less then a woman ready to be delivered, when her 17
throws and pangs are upon her.

3. We were in a most desperate condition and estate, 18.
no way able to help our selves, or to prevail against our foes. All our
endeavors could do nothing, brought forth but wind.

Nay we were altogether dead; and yet for all that, thou 19.
have restored life unto our souls, by thy word quickening us. As the dew of
heaven out of the seed rotted in the earth, brings forth herbs and fruit:
for what is the wonderful taking to of that Nation by the Ministry of the
Gospel, but life from the dead? Romans 11. 15.

Observations.
12. Thou disposest peace.] As God is the Author of all judgments: so is he
the worker of all our peace, Esaias 45. 7. I frame light and create darkness, I
make peace, and create evil, I Iehoua do all these. That in affliction we may
learn not to despair; his hand is as mighty to pull us out, as ever it was to
plunge us in.

To us.] But this is the comfort of Gods people, who are his favorites, and
depend upon his providence. The wicked have nothing to do with it.

Ordainest.] In this fatherly dealing of God with his Church and people, both
the end and the means are to be respected.

The end is peace; for all things sort for good unto them. Though he scourge
and beat them, it is but with the rods of the sons of men, moderately and in
measure, 2. Sam. 7. 14. Not for their hurt, but that he may do good unto them
in the end, Mica. 4. 12. Zach. 1. 15. Esaias 47. 7.

Which breeds a great content in the midst of most heavy crosses, makes
them warm at the heart, even then when they lie in their cold irons, to sing
and make a noise to the honor and praise of God, as if they were hot with
wine, as Paul and Sylas did, Acts 16.

Also all our affairs.] He does not only ordain things for good, but taking
the matter all and every whit into his own hands, frames and disposes of
every thing, as best may fit their purpose.

Our works.] Yea as well things done against his Church, as things by them and
for them, he by his marvelous wisdom that brings light out of darkness
makes to fall out for their singular good and comfort.

Our way therefore is to let him alone, and to rest in that which he shall do.
Not that we are to sit still and neglect the means he appoints for our
good: that were not to depend upon him, but to tempt him. But that when we
have done all we can, we roll our way upon the Lord to trust in him, and he
will do it, Psalm. 37. 5. 6.

13. Other Lords besides thee.] No affliction so much humbles Gods people, as
when such tyrannize over them, that would iustle Christ out of his throne.

Have maistred us.] And such men's tyranny is for the most part of all other
most heavy and intolerable, and makes the Church most to groan and sigh
under the burden of it.

Only through thee.] There be two reasons why God does so great and marvelous
things for his Church.

One that by helping them, when all help of man does fail, all means taken
away, which flesh and blood does look unto, he only may have the praise to do
wonderful things alone. Psalm. 72. 18. Thus he tells Gedeon coming with a
great Army against the Midianites: These people are to many for me to deliver
Midian into their hands, lest Israel take the glory to himself; Saying, my
right hand has done it. Judge. 7. 2. So prone we are to sacrifice to our own
nets, and to arrogate the praise due to God.

Do we mention thy name] The other is to the end he may ever have in the world
a Church to celebrate and magnify his name.

And here is the duty we owe to God for all his benefits, to be trumpets to
sound forth his praises. David in the Psalms often presses this argument; the
dead do not praise. Iah: nor any that go down into silence. But we will
bless Iah: from henceforth and for ever. Ps. 115. 17, 18.

16. In trouble:] See the corruption of man's nature; that has not the heart to
speak to God, unless he be pressed to it by hard and heavy corrections.

How necessary is affliction, that makes us visit God, to delight in his
acquaintance. Whereas otherwise we are ready with those wicked ones, Job 22.
17. Depart away from us.

Prayer is indeed the daughter of affliction: but it is the mother of comfort.
As it was to the Church here, and will be to all that tread in her steps. Who
ever humbled his soul in seeking God, and went away without finding that he
sought; either in the same or in a far more excellent kind. Manasses was
brought extremely low: but when he cried to the God of his Fathers, how did he
bring him back unto his kingdom.

Submisse] Only let us look our prayers be submisse, humble, and from the
soul. For proud Iustitiaries go away as empty as they came.

29. Dead] The assurance of Gods power, which I shall show it self in the
rising of all flesh, is the most exceltent argument to confirm us in the
promises of God, hose that are most incredible to flesh and blood. He that can
say to the Dead, awake and come to judgment, is not he able to put life into
this dead people of the Jews. Ezech. 37. Rev. 20. or can the condition of any
be so desperate, that he is not able to help them out?

Thy etc. my etc.] The promises of God we must so know to be true and certain
to all Gods people, that we exclude not our own special and particular
comfort. Job 19. 25.

In the dust] Of our selves we be most miserable, in lamentable and woeful
case: as mourners were wont to sit in the dust.

The work of Regeneration, which is knit and joined with the calling of the
jews, is as the rising of our dead bodies out of the dust. As little means
there is in us spiritually to quicken our souls, as in our carcases to raise
themselves unto life.

Awake] It is only the power of God that is able for to do it. He that said
the word and all things were made, that commanded light to shine out of
darkness; he only is the author of our new life.

Thy dew] The means is the word, the word of the Gospel preached and sounding
in the Church. 1 Pet. 1. 25.

Sing] This fills our mouths with cheerfulness and with gladness. What
matter ministers such songs and cause of rejoicing, as the quickening of our
souls dead in sins and trespasses?

20. Go to my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy doors upon thee:
hide for a very little while, till the indignation pass over.

21. For behold, Jehovah comes out of his place, to visit the iniquity of
the inhabitant of the earth upon him; and the earth shall disclose her bloods.
her slaughters, and shall no more hide her slain.

CHAP. 27.
1. In that same day will Jehovah visit with that his sore and great and
mighty sword, Leviathan the Serpent: bar, Leviathan, I say, the winding
Serpent: and will slay the Dragon that is in the Sea.

EXPOSITION.
THE Prophet now returns to prosecute his purpose broken off by the two
former Chapters, most sweetly enterlaced. Wherefore these two verses and the
27th Chapter following (which should in truth be but one entire Chapter, but
that I would not confound the received distinction) have an explication of both
parts of the prophecy that went before: to wit, first, The final delivery of
the Nation of the Jews, in the utter overthrow of the Turkish tyrant (which
you had Chap. 24 21. 22.) and then the flourishing felicite of the Jewish
Christian Church: (which was touched Chap. 24. 23.)

In the former part, there is first a Preparation, and then the Judgment it
self. 20


The preparation, first by a kind and loving Apostrophe to his people; wills
them to rest with patience under the 16 Posit. Distress.
hope of Gods gracious protection, betaking themselves to him with a sure faith
in his promises; whereby they may be safe and free in the midst of all
dangers and perils, as the Israelites were, Exodus 12. 22. keeping within their
doors when the destroyer went forth to slay the first borne in Egypt.

And though it be a time of indignation, the sorest and greatest time of
affliction that ever was in any nation. Dan. 12. 1. yet is it but a storm that
shall quickly blow over. As that holy Father once said of Iulians persecution.

Secondly, that they might lift up their eyes to behold how wonderful a
deliverance this should be, not a whit 21.
inferior, nay many degrees beyond that in Egypt, to which purpose serves the
word, Behold, a crier to prepare attention.

He shows the solemnity of this Judgment. God himself, says he, will come
down from heaven, out of his throne of glory, to execute the same. The earth
and all the creatures shall acknowledge the justice of it, for their ^nfinite
butcheries, the blood of Gods Saints shed by their hands. Then follows the
judgment it self: Chap. 27.
expressing what kind of enemy God will make to fall before 1.
them, and the means of his ruin.

The enemy has three names given him, two additions, 18 Posit. Conquest.
and the place of his habitation. All which may note as well the body and
large spread, as the power and hurtfulnes of his Empire.

The names are, Leviathan, a Serpent, a Dragon.

The additions, bar and winding the Serpent a bar: the winding Serpent. The
place of his habitation is the Dragon in the Sea.

He is worthily called Leviathan or a Whale, for the hugenes of his Empire, and
his monstrous might and power.

Serpent you may call him, yea a bar or long and a winding Serpent, if either
you consider the manner of his territories, somewhat resembling a long and
winding Serpent, as learned men have observed: Or the sorenes and the shifts,
slights and subtleties, which he uses against the Christians; whereof the
Turkish stories are full.

The very name of Dragon, the Revelation gives him, Rev. 20. for his
inveterate hatred and malice to Gods people, the open and professed hostility
against the name of Christ.

The place of his habitation is in the Sea, not in a petie River over one
people and nation, which how mighty and potent soever, yet is but one. As that
Dragons of Egypt was in the river Nilus. Ezech. 29. 3. But this man has the
whole Sea in subjection, the maine Ocean at his command: yea Constantinople,
the seat of his Empire, is seated in the very mouth and jaws of Pontus and
Propontis. Which is an evident argument, that this prophecy can not be drawn
to the King of Babel, who dwelt so far remote from the Sea.

The means of his destruction is that he shall fall by the sword in deadly and
cruel fight. Not that alone, but 19 Posit. Gods fighting.
by the mighty sword of God; who from heaven shall throw down upon him and
upon his army, showers of hailestones fire and brimstone to devour them.
Revel. 20. 8, 9, 10. Ezech. 38. and 39. Esaias 31. 8, 9.

Observations.
20. Go to my people] God never brings destruction upon the wicked, but he
first fore-warneth his, that they may escape. So he did to his people in
Egypt, to keep themselves within doors, whilst the destroyer plagued the
Egyptians.

Hide] When Gods judgments are upon the earth, it becomes us to humble our
selves and to hide our faces. Prove. 22. 3. The wise man sees the evil and
hides himself, but the wicked pass one and are punished.

Pass ouer] God suffers not his rod to lie for ever upon his children. He
exercises them but for a while till he have accomplished his purpose for good
unto them.

1. Sword] He has not only a rod to disple and correct, but a sword to slay
and cut off the enemies of the Chap. 27.
Church.

His judgments for the most part are suitable to men's sins. The cruel
persecutors of the Saints that filled the world with butcheries and massacres,
fall by the sword of Gods justice. His sword is furbished and fat with the
blood of them that embrued their hands with innocent blood. Esaias 34. 6. So is
verified that which the Psalmist speaks, Psalm. 76. 11. He makes the rage of
men to turn unto his glory.

Gods sword, is a sore, a hard, and a heavy sword: it cutteth to the quick,
bears down all that comes in the way.

No force nor fraud, no power nor domination, is able to stand before it.

The mighty tyrants of the world, whose finnes are as strong as bucklers, and
cleave so close together, that the wind can not come between them, (as in Job
it is said of the huge Leviathan, Job 41. 6, 7, 8.) have a way open for his
sword to pierce into.

Let us not fear man for all his swelling, whom it is so easy a thing for
Gods sword to work upon.

Winding Serpent] The wicked hold it for a maxim, that no faith is to be kept
with Gods people. Frauds, shifts, subtleties and devises: any way whereby they
may entrap and hurt, goes with them for virtue and valor.

Dragon] There is in the enemies of the name of Christ, as inveterate and
natural a hatred to the Church, as is in the Dragon to mankind. No marvel
therefore if they can never be at rest nor peace; seeing nothing will satisfy
their malice, but the blood of the Saints. Even as the Dragons, which let their
gorge be never so full, their kind carries them to the prey.

2. In that same day: a vineyard of red wine, sing ye unto it.

EXPOSITION.
HItherto of the overthrow of their enemies. The second branch (which is the
felicity of the Jewish Christian Church) has five steps or degrees.

First, is the Plantation or first erecting of this Church, noted under the
similitude of a vineyard planted.

Her excellency upon the first erecting, is set forth by two adioynts. 33
Posit. Glorious church


1. In calling it a vineyard of red, that is, of the best and most generous
Wine, Prou. 23. 31.

2. In that they shall sing for joy of this plantation, as when upon the
building of the second Temple, the people sung and shouted, grace, grace unto
it, Zach. 4. 7.

Observations.
2. Vineyard.] The Church of God is a vineyard of the 2.
Lords own planting, his hand does set and graffe all the plants of it.

Red wine.] It is in the sight of God, and so ought to be to us, as precious
and sweet as the best and most pleasant wine is unto the taste.

Sing.] We are to joy and take comfort in the good of the Church when it
prospers and fares well. As in the Psalms on the contrary part they grieve
and mourn that the wild beast of the Forest did tread it under foor, Psalm.
8. 12. etc.

And here is a notable argument or subject of our songs. Those that have
learning and eloquence, let them try their wits in this. Such as excel in
Poetry, may here find matter to exercise their pens. And this is a holy use
of the gifts that God has given us, when with David the sweet singer of
Israel, our pens walk to publish Gods praises, and when we utter our
Poemes in commendation of his word and works unto his people.

3. I Iehova do keep it, every moment will I water it: least any assail it,
night and day will I keep it.

4. Fury is not in me: who so shall set me with bryar and thorn into
battle, I will march through it and fire them out of it at once.

5. Or he shall take hold of my strength, make peace with me: peace shall he
make with me.

EXPOSITION.
THe second step is the Preservation or Gods providence and care of the Church
thus planted, to be seen three manner of ways.

First, toward the Church it self, he keeps it, and is as a wall of fire
round about, Zach. 2. 9. Moreover he does 3.
41. Posit. Safety of the Church.
water it every moment by the rain or dew of his Word and grace. So he has
his part, not only in her planting, but in her watering.

The second thing is in regard of the enemies of the Church, profane persons,
lest any such should visit, that is to say, rudely and unmannerly rush upon it,
he gardeth it night and day.

The third thing is toward Hypocrites that lurk in the bosom of the Church,
for all that are of Israel, are not Israel, 4.
Romans 9. Neither because they are among us, are they therefore of us. They went
out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would
have abidden with us, says the Apostle, 1. Ioh. 2. 19. But (says God)
howsoever there be in the Church secret enemies which provoke my wrath by their
offenses, yet will I not therefore suffer mine anger to rise against mine own
heritage: I have ways and means enough to bring them down, and yet to
preserve my people; for if any with his briars and thorns, that is, by his
malicious wickedness do offend, and as it were sting and prick me, I will
either in Justice punish him (marching up and down in warre-like manner, yet
warely, without touch or prejudice to the Church) or force him by true
repentance and acknowledgement of his fault, to take me by the arm and hold
my hand from striking or sending 5.
forth the fire of my wrath, that so he may taste my mercy.

Observations.
3. I Iehova keep it.] God not only planteth, but gardeth and protecteth his
Church. This is her rejoicing, that she is kept of such a worthy keeper.

Water it.] We are of our selves as the dry heath, as the barren and parched
ground, unable to bring any fruit but by special watering, and Gods blessing.

The Word of God is that whereby he waters his Church, and makes it fertile
and fruitful. It is our duty therefore to wait for it, with as great
earnestness as the dry and stony ground does for rain to fall from heaven.

Every moment.] And this watering must be continually, every moment our hungry
bodies have not so much need of refreshing at their ordinary meals, as our
thirsty souls have of this spiritual and heavenly moisture.

Least any assail it.] The Church, that is most amiable and worthy to be
loved of all, is not without deadly and sworn enemies that from their soul
seek her ruin and overthrow. These enemies are restless day and night, they
watch to do her mischief.

But our comfort is, we have one more watchful then they. The watchman of
Israel that neither slumbreth nor sleeps, and who keeps us day and night.

4. There is no rage.] There be always hypocrites left in the Church to
exercise the faith and patience of the Saints.

God knows how to free the godly and to reserve the wicked unto punishment,
2. Pet. 2.

Note here three forcible arguments to keep men from sin.

With bryar.] 1. Sin is as brambles or briars to prick God, and to gall him
to the heart.

Set me into battle.] 2. It bids God battle, and as a Herald proclaims
war between him and us. And to speak with the Apostle, Shall we provoke
God to wrath? are we stronger then he? 1. Cor. 10. 22. Who ever hardened
himself against God and prospered? Job 9. 4.

Fire I will cut him out of her.] 3. It draws judgment upon our selves: yea
the utter ruin and destruction of our souls.

There be also three forcible arguments to be drawn from hence, that should
move us to repentance, answering those former three.

5. Lay hold on my strength. 1 Where sin bideth battle to God, who is too hard
for us. Repentance takes him by the arm, and holds his hand that it should
not strike us.

And make.] 2. Where sin galleth and fretteth God, Repentance does mediate
peace with him.

He shall make.] 3. It not only mediateth, but procures firm peace and
Concord: and so preuenteth his judgments that would otherwise come upon us.

6. As touching those to come, he shall cause Iaakob to take root, Israel
shall blossom and bud: and they shall fill the face of the inhabited world
with increase.

7. Has he smitten him According to the stroke of his smiter.
as he smote his smiter: or is he slain according to the slaughter of those
that were slain by him?

8. In measure, when thou sendest it forth, do thou debate with it? him he
takes away with that his rough blast, as in the day of the easterly wind.

9. Wherefore by this shall the iniquity of Iaakob be purged and this is all
the fruit, that he may put away his sin: when he shall make all the stones of
the Altar as chalk stones broken in pieces, the Groaues and Sunne-images shall
not stand up.

10. But his fensed City shall be desolate, pleasant habitation dismissed and
forsaken like a wilderness: There shall the calfe feed, and there lie down,
and consume the branches of it.

11. When the bough thereof is dry, the twigs shall be broken off, women shall
come and set it on fire: for he is not a people Of understanding.
of any understanding, therefore he that made him, will not have mercy on him,
and he that formed him, will not show him grace.

EXPOSITION.
THe third step is the Adornation or blessing which he will bestow upon the
Church, planted, kept, and watered: 6.
and they are three.

1. Stabilitie, being fast rooted and fixed that nothing can shake their faith.
And hereof the Lord himself is the 42 Posit. Stability of the Church.
Author, whose right hand as it does set and plant them, water and manure them,
so it does root and make them spread, And who then dare offer to pluck them up?

2. Beauty, in the goodly spreading and blossoming of their branches. 39 Posit.
Prosperity.


3. Fruitfulness and fecundity, dispersing far and near the fruits of their
Faith. 38 Posit. Multitude of believers.


These blessings are amplified by a dissimilitude of Gods dealing with those
Tyrants, of whom he spoke before, and 7.
toward his own people. First propounded, verse. 9. has God smitten (his own
people the Jews) as he has smitten the enemy that smote them? or are his
own people slaughtered in that kind as those are slaughtered, whose hand God
uses to slaughter them?

Then is it specified in two instances.

First, in the diverse manner of afflicting. With his people 8.
God deals.

1. Moderately, and in measure.

2. In gentle and loving manner: for though he disperse and scatter them into
hard and cruel bondage, it is but as it were a sending of them forth abroad
into the world; a translating of them into another place, whence they may be
taken up and replanted in their native soil, so as there is hope for them to
spring anew, far otherwise it is with the wicked: for,

1. To him it is boy sterously and roughly.

2. He does utterly sweep him away, and pull him up by the roots, that his
place shall be found no more. As before, chap. 26. 14.

Secondly, in the diverse end: to his people the Jews whom his purpose is to
call (for so does the Apostle apply this place, Romans 11, 27. Chastisements and
afflictions serve to purge iniquity, and to bring them to Christ through faith
and true repentance, testifying the same by abolishing all false worship and
service, that nothing may stand or hold up the head which is enemy to Gods
glory, but be thrown down and abolished.

But Gods hand upon the wicked is to their utter ruin: how strong soever they
seem unto themselves, and never 10.
so pleasantly seated, all shall be made a wilderness; God will turn things
vpside down, from the lowest twigge to the top branch.

Which on Gods partis a thing most easy and most just: so easy, even when he
deals with the stoutest of them, 11.
that he stands not in need of any great means for the matter. A company of
silly women shall be sufficient to do the feat. Again, it is most just, for
the wicked have no wisdom, nor will learn, no not by stripes and
punishments. Therefore he that made and formed them, in whose hands they are as
clay in the hands of the Potter, though they be his own work, the creatures
whom his fingers have fashioned and made, will show no favor unto them, but
they shall utterly be done away.

Observations.
6. Touching those to come.] The right hand of the Lord does bring great
changes.

His arm is no more powerful to tumble, cast down, lay waste and desolate a
most flourishing state and people when they sin against him, then it is to
set up and advance the most miserable and forlorn that turn unto him, Read
Psalm. 107. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38.

Make to root, etc.] Here is Gods might and greatness evident to be seen: but
behold his love and kindness to his Church. He is not content to plant and
keep it, to water and manure it; but he bestows all that is requisite,
whereby it may grow and flourish. He makes it strong and fair, full of
goodly fruit.

The strength therefore of the Church and all the good of it comes from God
alone, from his providence and presence, Psalm. 125. 1.

7. 8. 9. 10. 11. In measure, etc.] Withal note the difference of his dealing
with the wicked and his own children. Upon these does he but sprinkle a
parcel of his wrath, some few sparks of displeasure: but the wicked he
utterly consumes and burns up with the fire of his indignation, Esaias 42. 25.
and 66. 15.

By this, etc.] Observe two notable things touching afflictions.

1. Their singular and incomparable use: to purge iniquity, to pardon and
forgive offenses.

2. The persons that so profit by it: Jacob, the Church and true Israel of
God: for this is not by any virtue or quality inherent in afflictions, seeing
the wicked taste of this cup as well as others, and are never a whit the
better: but by the mercy and goodness of God, sanctifying the same for so
excellent a use unto his children.

The iniquity of Jacob.] Forgiveness of sins is the peculiar privilege of
Gods children, a treasure which he hides and lays up in the Church alone,
Psalm. 130. 8. He vedeemeth Israel from all his iniquities, Micah 7. 18. Who is
a mighty God like to thee, that pardons iniquity and passes by the
transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? Wherefore worthily in the
articles of our Faith (that which we call the Apostles Creed) after believing
that there is a holy Catholic Church, this among many other things proper
thereunto is one. I believe the forgiveness of sins.

Neither is there any sin so foul that Faith in the blood of Christ does not
wash away, Esaias 1. 18.

What sin like unto Idolatry? that makes a divorce between God and us,
dissolueth the spiritual marriageknot, as Adultery does the carnal: yet lo,
even this truly repented of, finds grace and mercy at the hand of God.
Notable to that purpose is the place of Jeremy, Ier. 3. 1. If a man put away
his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, will he return unto
her any more, should not that same land be defiled? But thou have played the
harlot with many friends, yet return to me, the speech of Iehova.

All sins therefore to Gods children are venial, pardonable, and pardoned in
Christ. As on the other side to those that are not in him, the least sin is
mortal, damnable, and brings damnation. This doctrine tends not to give
men scope to sin, but to comfort poor repentants that have sinned.

Be purged.] But how come sins, especially so great and heinous, thus to be
remitted? By the only purgation that Christ has made, Heb. 1. 3. who upon the
cross paid the full price and ransom for them. And this one purgation of his
overthrows all false and fantastical purgatories that the idle brain of
man's wit has invented.

When he shall make all the stones of the Altar, etc.] With forgiveness of
sins is joined true repentance as an inseparable companion, or rather (in
nature, not in time) the forerunner of it, Acts 3. 3. Repent and convert that
your sins may be blotted out.

There be certain notes and marks whereby true repentance does testify and
bewray it self.

1. A holy detestation of sin, those sins especially which are most lift up
against the glory of God, and whereby we have most provoked him to anger.

2. To remove all means and occasions of sin demolishing and casting down
whatsoever is against the glory of God.

3. Utterly to forsake sin, and not to resort any more as a dog unto his
vomit, or as the Sow that is washed, to the wallowing in the mire, 2. Pet. 2.

This is it he means by saying, the groaues and the Sunne-images shall not
stand up. that is, shall so be thrown down and made away, that they shall
never be reedified.

13. A people of no vnderstanding] True wisdom is in the fear of God, which
is the fountain and beginning, the prime and principality of all wisdom.
Prove. 17. He is a fool by the constant verdict of the wisest, and has no jot
of understanding, that cares not to deck and adorn himself herewith. Let
men brag never so much of their prudence in counsel, their deep reaches and
profound policies to sway scepters, manage Commonwealths and Kingdoms: if
they refuse the fear of God, reject his word, where only this fear is to be
learnt, whereof can there be any wisdom in them? Ier. 5. 9. Though they seem
as wise as the King of Tyrus was in his own imagination, they shall dye the
death of the uncircumcised. Ezech. 28.

12. And it shall be in that same day, Jehovah shall thresh from the channel
of that river unto the stream of Egypt: and ye shall be gathered by one, one.
one by one, o children of Israel.

EXPOSITION.
THE fourth step is the Perfection of this Church, in 12.
that,

1. They shall possess and replenish the whole land, as 24 Posit. Inhabit all
the land.
before. For from Euphrates (meant here by the channel of the river) unto the
river of Egypt, were their just and lawful bounders. The inheritance first
promised to Abraham, Genesis 15. 18. and afterward in possession both of David, 2 Samuel 8. 3. 1 Cron. 18. 3. and of Solomon, 2 Cron. 9. 26.

2. Their calling shall be general and universal. Not one left out whom God
has appointed to salvation. as Ezech. 39. 28.

Observations.
12. Shall thresh] The ministry of the word is Gods flayle to sever the
chafe from corn; to single his out of the midst of wicked and profane
worldlings.

One by one] There is no thresher in the world that thresheth half so clean:
for he loses not one grain. Those that thou have given me I have kept, and
not one of them is lost but that son of destruction. etc. Ioh. 7. 12. This
singular comfort have all that are his: it is impossible any one should perish,
whom God the Father has given to his Son.

And withal what a thing is this? How great an extent of love? God has not
only a care of the Church in general, but of every one particularly and by
the poll. The good shepherd calls his own sheep by name. Ioh. 10. 3.

13. And it shall be in that same day, a blast shall be blown with a great
trumpet, and those shall come that perished in the land of Ashur, and the
outcasts in the land of Egypt: and shall bow down to Jehovah in the holy
mount at Jerusalem.

EXPOSITION.
THE fifth and last step is their D^tacion. For not they 13.
only shall be called, but the large and vaste countries, 44 Posit. All
nations embracing Christ.
all the tract of the East and of the South, shall be converted unto Christ, by
the great trumpet, the sound of the Gospel coming into all the parts of the
world, from one end of the heaven unto another; which is the last mark that
our Savior gives to fore-runne his last and glorious coming. Matthew. 24. 31.
and which being once accomplished, the world before that age or generation
pass, shall have an end. Math. 24. 34.

And these, says he (which is the cause why he makes mention of them here)
shall bow down to Jehovah in the holy 45 Posit. The nations honoring them.
mount at Jerusalem. That is, Such shall be the brightness of the new Jerusalem,
the Church of the Jews won to Christ, that the nations of those that are to
be saved shall walk in her light; and the Kings of the earth shall bring their
glory and honor in unto her. Rev. 21. 24. Read Esaias 60. So I distinguish
between the 14 and 15 verses in the very same manner as I find these things
distinguished Zach. 10. 12, 13.

Observations.
13. Perish] How miserable is the state of all those that are not in Christ.
They perish in their ignorance and diverse sins: living they are dead;
perdition it self has already seized of them. This is all we can brag of, if
we look unto our selves as we are the natural sons of Adam.

A blast etc.] O therefore the excellency of the preaching of the Gospel,
never sufficiently to be commended! which is the great trump of God to save
those that perish, to put life into the dead. As our Savior says, Ioh. 5. 25.
The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear, shall
live.

And shall bow down in the holy mount at Ierusalem] It is a holy fruit of the
communion of Saints not to envy the graces of God in our brethren, but to make
use of them: and where God shows most love, there for men to give most honor.

THese words are a part of the message which the Angel Gabriel sent Ambassador
from the God of heaven had in commission to deliver to our Prophet. It is a
noble Prophecy of the state of Gods people, how after the winter of 70. years
captivity, there should come a spring of 70. times seven years continuance in
their land and country. In which time the Temple and City shall be built
anew, Christ the Lord of the Temple by his personal presence shall abolish the
legal worship, and at the last in fact take it quite away, destroying both
Temple and City by the Roman Armies, which justly shall light upon their
heads for refusing the salvation which this great Prophet their Lord and
redeemer came into the world to bring unto them.

Three questions here naturally arise upon the unfolding whereof the
understanding of this Scripture does much depend: one from what time these 70.
seauens take their beginning: another when they determine and have an end: the
third, who should be the Messiah here spoken of. For the discussing of these,
and to bring some light to so dark and difficult a piece of Scripture,
somewhat must first be said of the 70. years captivity, and of Darius the
Mede, and Cyrus King of Persia, that brought an end unto it.

There were 3. captiuities of Gods people all mentioned, 2. Chron. 36. and 2.
Kings 24. and 25.

The first toward the end of the third year of Iehoiakim, and the beginning
of his fourth, being the first year of Nabuchadnetsar, when Daniel and his
fellows were led away captives, Ier. 25. 1. Dan. 1. 1.

The second under Iehoiacin or Iechonia about the eight year of
Nabuchadnetzar; from whence Ezechiel is wont to reckon, Ezekiel. 1. 2. being
himself one of that captivity.

The third in the eleventh of Zedechia and ninteenth of Nabuchadnetsar when the
City and temple were destroyed: from which of these the 70. years captivity
should begin, is a great question. I refer it to the first: for,

1. Jeremy gives but 70. years to Babel, which are first spoken of when great
Nebuchadnetzar began his reign, Ierem. 25. And by those 70. years of Babel
he boundeth the captivity, Ier. 29. 10. When 70. years be accomplished to
Babel (so I read, not, at Babel) I will visit you, etc.

2. Those words being written to the Jews of the second captivity, are an
apparent proof that, part of the 70. years captivity was then expired. And
thus it may well stand that Haggai says, in the sixth year of Darius, that
many there present had seen the former house, Hag. 2. 3. for it was destroyed
not past 67. years before. Also Daniel was not to old to wield the Babilonian
Empire in the time of Darius Medus, it being but the 70. seventh year of his
captivity. And Ezrah (whose father Seraiah was slain when the Temple was
burnt, 2. Kings 25. 21.) might be active in the seventh of Artaxerxes, Ezra 7.
8. which was 21. years after that sixth year of Darius, and so 88. years from
the death of his father. All which things, but by this reckoning, could hardly
be admitted.

He that pulled down the Babylonian pride, was Darius the Mede. Cyrus (as
Zenophon also writes) was but the Lieutenant of his Army, and acknowledged
him his Sovereign: For,

First this Conquest is every where attributed to the Medes, Esaias 13. 17.
Behold I will raise up against him the Mede, Ier. 51. 11. The Lord raises up
against Babylon, the Spirit of the Kings of Media; and verse. 28. Prepare
against her the Nations, the Kings of Media, her Princes and all her Nobles,
and all the Land of his Dominion.

Secondly, Darius took (of his own authority, not by any man's gift) the
Kingdom, as soon as Belshazzer was slain, Dan. 5. 31. And he it was whom
the Angel did encourage and strengthen, Dan. 1. 11. That he might overcome the
Chaldeans, he disposed of the Empire, and set up 120. Governors, Dan. 6. 1.
And in all his time no mention is made of Cyrus.

Thirdly, Daniel recites his visions in order thus, In the first year of
Belshazzer, Dan. 7. 1. In the third year of Belshazzer, Dan. 8. 1. In the
first year of Darius. Dan. 9. 1. In the third year of Cyrus, Dan. 10. 1.

Fourthly, Darius reign is reckoned as distinct from Cyrus and before Cyrus,
Dan. 6. 29. He reigned not a year (being 62. years old when Belshazzar was
slain, Dan. 5. 31.) and let Cyrus his Successor: for Daniel in the first of
his reign understood the 70. years to be that year accomplished. Dan. 92. So
the Prophecy of Jeremy was fulfilled, that the 70. years Captivity, and the
Babylonian Monarchy should end together. ler. 25. 12. and 29. 10.

But it will be objected that, 2 Chronicles. 36 20. the captivity lastest till the
Kingdom of Persia came in. Therefore that Cyrus reigned together with Darius;
else the Babylonian Monarchy should not end with the captivity: for the reign
of Darius Medus came between.

I answer, Darius reign was a part of the Persian Monarchy; for he wrote
himself King of the Medes and Persians: and seeing the Persian name prevailed
above the Medes, and that instantly (Darius dying the same year) Ezra calls
the whole succession from the time of the taking of Babylon, the Kingdom of
Persia.

This Darius was the son of Assuerus, of the seed of the Medes, Dan. 9. 1.
whom (leaving to every man his judgment free) I take to be that Assuerus
which was Queen Esters husband, and that she was not wife, neither to Darius
Hystaspis, or any other succeeding King: for,

First, there be but two Assuerusses mentioned in the Scripture: this and
another, Ezra 4, 6. Succestor. unto Cyrus. But he reigned nothing near 13.
years, as our Assuerus did, Ester 3. 7. compared with Ester 9. 1. nor was a
friend but a perpetual enemy to the Jews. And seeing the holy Ghost does so
precisely distinguish the Persian Kings by their several and proper names,
which bring great light unto a Story: I would not confound these things to give
two names to one, and the same person; that in one place he should be called
Darius, in another Assuerus, without apparent evidence and warrant out of the
Scripture.

Secondly, the whole course of Esters Story shows that it was acted during
the captivity; for it is not credible that after the return of 49000. under
Cyrus. Ezra 2. there should be left such a multitude of Jews, and of that
strength, as at Susis, were able to kill 800. of their enemies, and in the rest
of Assuerus Dominions, 75000. Ester, 9. 12. 15. 16. nor would Mordecai and
Queen Hester after the Temple built again have instituted the Purim, Ester 9.
31. without sending to the house of God to enquire of the Lord by the mouth of
his Priests and Prophets, what were to be done as the people did, Zach. 7. 2.
3. And in the Letters that Mordecai wrote to all the Jews which were in the
Provinces of King Assuerus far and near, appointing them to celebrate that
day, Ester 9. 20. 21. they in Iudaea would by name have been spoken of, if at
that time the people had been come back?

Thirdly, Assuerus Hesters husband was King of Media and Persia; for he made
that great feast to the Princes of his Armies of Persia and Media. Ester 1. 3.
and the acts of Mordecaies greatness are said to be registered in the
Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia, Ester 10. 2. But I find not after
Cyrus once came to the helm, that they are at any time in holy Scripture
called Kings of Media and Persia, but of Persia only* for being at the first a
beast of two horns, the Kingdom of Media and Persia, Dan. 8. 20. this latter
that rose up after, grew higher than the other and took the honor from it,
Dan. 8. 3.

Fourthly, Why does the holy Ghost, Dan. 9. 1 speak of Assuerus father to
Darius the Mede, more than of the father of Cyrus or any other, but for some
special purpose? And that must be in regard of the Story of Ester.

Fifthly, Mordecaies age does prove it; his opposing against Haman, and the
other things he did in the twelfth of Assuerus cannot be thought to come from
so old a man as he must be, if you make Assuerus to be Darius Hystaspis: for
from the captivity of Ieconias when Mordecai was led away, Ester 2. 6. to the
twelfth of Assuerus, are 83. years: and if he were then but 7. years of age,
which is not likely, he must now be 90. neither is to be thought that he would
at those years begin to enter into the affairs of the State (especially of
such a great and turbule^t State) as he did, Ester 10. Barzillai long before
being but 80. refused a better offer to be in David's Court, because of the
greatness of his age. 2. Chron. 19. 33, 34, 35, 36.

This Assuerus reigned from India to Ethiopia as it is commonly translated. But
the Hebrew is from India to Cush. Cush may be taken as well for Arabia as
Aethiopia; and to some parts of Arabia his Kingdom might well reach, even
whilst the Babilonians bare their greatest sway: for the Kings which should
subdue Babylon, that is the Medes and Persians, are called mighty Nations and
great Kings, Ier. 27. 7.

And Herodotus in his first Book does wonderfully extol the great power of
Cyaxeres the Mede (by that name Stories call this Assuerus and his father) who
ruled (as he says) over all Asia, and subdued the Assyrians, the Babylonians
only excepted: it is like his territories extended to the Indians Eastward, and
of the other side unto Arabia and Nebuchadnetzars most about Babylon, and in
Egypt, Tyrus and the regions of Asia minor.

Howsoever it were, if he enlarged not his bounds so far, whilst
Nebuchadnetzar was alive, at the least he might do it in the time of
Euilmerodach, who lost much to the Medes and Persians, and was at the last
slain in battle against them.

That which makes all the doubt is that Mordecai was carried prisoner from
Jerusalem by Nebuchadnetzar, King of Babel in the captivity of Ieconiah, Ester
2. 6. Therefore he dwelt not under the dominion of Assuerus the Mede: for from
Nebuchadnetzar till Babel was taken by Darius, none of the Medes had footing in
that Kingdom. Nay, the Jews by Gods ordinance were to serve the King of
Babel, his son and sons son till the years of the captivity should be
expired, as may be gathered by Ier. 27. 7. 2. Chron. 36. 20. And a Babylonian
King (if it were during the captivity) this Assuerus could not be; for the
Kingdom of Babylon was promised to Nebuchadnetzar his son and sons son,
Ier. 25. 6, 7. who are named to be Euilmerodach, 2. Kings 25. 27. and
Belshazzar, Dan. 5.

This indeed is a great objection, to the which of a certain I can say
nothing. But seeing Assuerus was a King of the Medes and Persians, and even
during the Babilonian captivity there was at Susis where Assuerus kept his
court, Ester 1. 2. a Palace for the Kings of Media and Persia: Dan. 8. 2. Why
may it not be that multitude of the Jews dispersed themselves hither and
thither into diverse Countries, as they could best make shift, especially in the
confusion and shuffling of things, when Nebuchadnetzar was thrown out of his
Kingdom; and Mordecai happily among the rest might transport himself to Susis.

In this City was Daniel the third year of King Belshazzar, Dan. 8. 2. for so
I hold he was indeed and not in a vision: he might be by the river Vlai in a
vision: but when he saw that vision he was really in the Palace at Susis.
Belike in regard of his great wisdom he was sent thither upon some Embassage
or other employment for the service of the King his master: So verse. 27. of
that Chapter seems to import; for certainly at that time Susis was of the
Medes dominion.

The generality therefore of the people might be under the King of Babel; for
it was the Babylonicall captivity, seeing the Land of Iudaea belonged to the
Babylonian, and no return could be without his leave) though many of them
shifted for themselves elsewhere.

Perhaps also the King of Medes, either taking advantage of those great changes
in the state and Commonwealth that could not but fall out upon the expelling of
Nebuchadnetzar, or in the looseness of Euilmerodachs reign when his father
was dead, subdued those places in Mesopotamia about the river Chebar, whether
the Jews of Ieconias captivity were led away, Ezech. 1. 3. and 2. 25. many
other things there be which might make an alteration, that are not
particularly and by name expressed in the Scripture, Wherefore Gods great
goodness to his poor afflicted Church did herein maruellously show it self,
that at one and the sametime, under the captivity, in the midst of their
greatest heaviness; Mordecai and Queen Ester among the Medes, and Daniel with
the Babylonians were so highly exalted.

After Darius death came the proclamation of Cyrus which is recorded, 2 Chronicles.
36. and Ezr. 1. That Darius was then dead appears by the Memorandum found
among the records, Ezra 6. 2. 3. made in the first year of K. Cyrus: Cyrus
made a decree, etc. and by the proclamation it self. Thus says Cyrus King of
Persia: God has given unto me all the Kingdoms of the Earth, etc. If Darius
had been living, Cyrus would not have written himself King of Persia; for all
Darius time it was the Medes and Persians: At the least he would not have said,
that God had given him all the Kingdoms of the earth, when Darius was his
Sovereign; neither would he have been named King of Babel at that time (as
Ezra 5. 13. relating thereunto does call him) which without question was Darius
his during his life. Dan. 5. 31. and 6. 1. 2. etc.

Now then for the first question (of the three formerly propounded) from this
Edict of Cyrus (the time when the seauenty years captivity ended) begin the
seauenty seauens: for,

1. Certainly, they include the whole time of the peoples welfare; so the
words of the Angel sound, Seauenty seauens are determined upon thy people and
upon thy holy City: But that was promised to be as soon as the seauenty years
captivity should expire, Ier. 29. 10. After seauenty years be accomplished to
Babel, I will visit you, and perform my good promise, to cause you to return
to this place. The performance of which promise Daniel here prays, that God
would not defer, verse 19. And the Angel tells him, verse. 23. he was
heard in that he prayed for, and that the Angel was come to declare the same
unto him.

2. The Angel speaks of the going forth of the word, as of a thing
notorious: which must needs be the word or proclamation that was to come from
Cyrus; for of him the Scripture speaks by name, Esaias 43. 23. and other
promise there was not any.

3. To suspend the beginning so long, as till Darius Nothus, or the second
Artaxerxes (whom they call Artaxerxes Muemon) were to make Daniel and the whole
Church (for whose comfort this Prophecy was revealed) ignorant of the
beginning. And then there should have needed another to have interpreted the
Angel, and to show when that Edict was to be published.

It is true, the Edict was not gone forth when Daniel used this prayer; for his
prayer was in the reign of Darius the Mede, at what time Cyrus was not as yet
the absolute Lord: But it appears, Dan. 9. 1, 2. Daniel knew the time was now
come when the same must be accomplished, and Cyrus notoriously known to be the
person that must do it, Esaias 43. 23. So that of this Edict presently to be
promulged, both himself and the whole Church took certain knowledge:
wheresome object that the Angel speaks not of the bringing back of the
people, or of the building of the Temple, but to build Jerusalem again, and
therefore that it cannot be meant of Cyrus Edict; but must be referred to the
twentieth of Artaxerxes Mnemon, when Nehemie received commission from him to
build the City of the sepulchers of his fathers, that is to say Jerusalem: it
is much mistaken: for,

1. Daniels prayer was for the Sanctuary as well as for the Citle, and the
Angel no doubt entendeth the building of them both.

2. The promise makes it clear; for the Prophet Esaias long before told what
Cyrus Edict should be: Esaias 44. 23. Let Jerusalem be reedified, and the
foundation of the Temple laid. According to which words you must construe the
words of the Edict it self, though it express but the house at Jerusalem by
name. The same being made to fulfill the word forespoken of by the Lord, 2.
Chr. 36. 22. and Ezr. 1. 1. Even as on the other side, by virtue of the first
Artaxerxes inhibition to build the City, the work of the house of the Lord was
restrained: Ezr. 4. 21. 24. So both were in true meaning joined together: And
Ezr. 4. 12. the enemies of the Jews wrought in the time of that first
Artaxerxes, that the Jews were a building of Jerusalem and repairing of the
walls; therefore the Edict of Cyrus bare them out to do it.

3. The Angelioyneth the destruction of the City and the Sanctuary, both to be
after 62. seauens, verse. 26. therefore they begin together.

This is then the beginning of the seauens, their end is at the destruction of
the City and Temple by Uespatian; so far they reach, and are not determined
by the death of Christ: for,

First, the Angels words (answering Daniels prayer) are so expressly, verse. 24.
Seauenty seauens are determined for thy holy City. And again, verse. 27. The
City and the Sanctuary so all the people of a foreign Governor destroy.

Secondly, the desolation that the Roman Army should make, verse. 26. and 27.
and was done some 40. years after the death of Christ, is in the 27. verse
expressly made a work of one part of the seventh seven.

The last and greatest question is touching the Messiah here spoken of; for to
apply it to any other than to the true Messiah, Christ our Savior, some have
branded with the mark of Iudaisme. But Messiah in the absolute (2. Sam. 1.
21.) Messiah adiectiuely taken (Leuit. 4. 3. etc.) the Messiah of Jehovah
(proper unto Christ, Psalm. 2. 2. 1. Sam. 2. 10.) are attributed unto other,
even unto such as were no types of Christ. (Esaias. 45. 1.)

Many things there are which induce me to think, that this place is not to be
understood of Christ the Lord.

1. The Hebrew distinction Athnach (verse. 24) makes a full point after the
seven seauens, thus, from the going forth of the word to a Messiah governor
shall be seven seauens. Which being but 49. years reach not to Christ's time.
To set the points at naught, as invented by the Massorits, is to weaken all the
ioints of holy writ. The singular use of Athnach, you may notably see, 2.
Kings 2. 14. Where this only accent brings light to the true exposition of
that Scripture, and freeth it from a dangerous error, which otherwise the text
might seem to give countenance unto.

2. This Messiah was not to be cut off whilst Jerusalem stood and flourished,
for so the Angel says, ver. 26. Sixty two seauens the city shall again be
built street and wall. And after those sixty two Seauens, Messiah shall be cut
off. Therefore it is not meant of Christ; for, Jerusalem continued built street
and wall some forty years after his death. Some would needs fasten a strange
kind of speech upon the Angel: for who ever said 7. and 62. when he may
as well say 69. Neither can it be excused by the Hebrew phrase. They indeed
commonly set the lesser number first as nine and sixty, for sixty nine (Genesis
5 17.) though you may see by this very place that the same is not perpetual.
But for sixty nine to say seven and sixty two, was never spoken in the
tongue of Canaan.

3. It is not nothing (though I will lay no great weight upon it) which is said
verse. 26. Messiah shall be cut off, and and there shall be nothing to him, no
remain of any power: nothing left of him. The phrase imports an utter
extinguishment without hope of reuiuer: But of the death of Christ the Prophets
are wont to speak in any other kind of style, Esaias 53. 8. By distress and
judgment is he taken away: but his generation who shall declare? meaning, that
for all that he shall live for ever.

But to let that pass, how will the time of his cutting off, (if you refer
it to the death of Christ) agree? For, after those 7. seauens and 62. seauens
wherein Messiah shall be cut off, there is but one seven left from thence to
the destruction of Jerusalem.

To salve this, some reckon the first seven seauens in Computation, after the
62. though in the Angels narration they have the praecedence, making the 62. to
reach to Christ's baptism: the other seven seauens from thence to the ruin of
the state and policy of the Jews. Touching the last seauentieth that (say
they) the Angel leaves out, because God for his Elect sake has shortened
those days, as our Savior teaches. Mat. 24.

But first this makes the holy oracle confused and obscure, if the Angel
speaking first of seven seauens, and then of 62. seauens, and beginning with
the latter expressly and by name, should never make mention of the former; but
contrariwise, mention only one seven [vers. 27.] and by that understand the
first of those seven seauens, which all entendment would carry to that which
alone is behind of all the number. Again, it were confused to tell first of
the destruction of the City and sanctuary, [vers. 26] and then to come back,
[vers. 27.] to the death of Christ, in the first of those seven seauens, that
is, to a thing done some forty years before: Whereas in the sense that we do
follow, all things flow naturally, properly, aptly, and in a method worthy of
an Angel: for, first he lays down the total of the 70. seauens, then
sub-diuideth them into 7. 62. and one (that is to say, the seauentieth) and
handles every part in order: As by the exposition shall appear.

Secondly, to leave out one while seven of the number, can have no excuse.
Indeed 70. seauens may be spoken instead of sixty nine and a half, or some
such parcel; and that is the rule of a round entire number put for a broken
one: but to propound 70. and to handle but 69. no rule nor example warranteth.
And it crosses the words of the Angel in the beginning; Seauenty seauens are
each of them cut out, etc. He joins a verb singular to a nowne plural, to
note, that every part and period of these seauens is precisely to hold without
any fraction. As for the words of our Savior Christ, that God for the Elects
sake shortened those days, they are manifestly wrested. he shortened nothing
of that which the Angel did foretell, when he spoke of 70. seauens to be cut
out; but in his everlasting counsel decreed those days of the affliction of
the Jews to be but short: for had they been as long as they were sore and
eager, the whole Nation must have perished.

Wherefore I take it, that by a Messiah or anointed governor, he means a
governor which the Jews shall have set up from among themselves, opposed to a
foreign governor, verse. 26. For, before the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans, there were two Rulers of the City: one of their own People, a Jew by
profession or birth; the other a stranger, appointed Deputy by the Roman
State. The first Messiah or anointed governor was Nehemie, whom Artaxerxes
constituted Prince in the Land of Judea, in the twentieth year of his reign,
Nehem. 5. 14. being just 49. years from the Edict of Cyrus: He built a
Palace for the Princes Court, Nehem. 2. 8. and Sanballat in a Letter to
Nehemie upon his building of the walls, scoffeth at him, as if he meant to be
King of the Jews, Nehem. 6. 6. which Nehemie there worthily puts off, as a
fiction of his own devising: Nehem. 6. 8. Whether Nehemie and the rest were
anointed with oil or no, I pass not, no more than I do of Cyrus, or of
those of whom the Psalmist speaks, Ps. 105. 15. Touch not mine anointed
ones, and do my Prophets no harm. The Angel gives him the name of
anointed; because he was of that People, whom God had sanctified to himself.

These things praemised; let us see how we may make up this number of seauenty
seauens, that is, of 490. years: which I would thus reckon.

The Persian Monarchy, whereunto men give some 106. years, some 125. some
130. some 190. some 220. and the Hebrews generally but 50. did intruth endure
70. years, and no more, as I gather out of the 23. of Esaias; the Scripture in
those uncertainties, being the only Oracle you can resort unto: In that
Chapter the Prophet, verse. 1. forewarneth Tyrus of a threefold calamity to come
upon her: one by her home servants, the second by the Chaldeans, the third by
Alexander the great out of the Land of Cittim: The two latter he insisteth most
upon from the 14. verse: Seauenty years she shall be forgotten, meaning laid
waste and desolate, verse. 15. even the days of one King, that is, during all
the time of the Babylonian Empire, who for the dishonor of lying there so long
in siege, Ezech. 29. is (Josephus, lib. 1. cap. 11. says, 13. years) did
bear mortal hate to her.

Afterward she shall flourish again, be jolly and frollicke as the Prophet
expresses by an Apostrophe, or turning of his speech unto her, verse. 16. But
how long must that in dure? it is easily gathered out of the beginning of the
17. verse; for when he says, After seauenty years the Lord shall reuisite
Tyrus, meaning, shall give her a second blow by Alexander the great, he does
plainly show that the continuance of her prosperity which was from Cyrus to
Alexander, should be 70. years, and consequently that 70. years are the
bounds of the Persian Monarchy.

And in all reason it could not be much longer, seeing Nehemie, who was no
babe, but a Prince and a chief Commander among those that ascended out of the
captivity in the beginning of Cyrus reign, Ezr. 2. 2. lived to see the last
Darius, Nehem. 12. 22. So as, if you gave him then but 20 or 25. years, and to
the Persian Monarchy but 70. he was fast upon 100. beyond which years it was
not ordinary for men in those days to live.

Concerning the particular years of the Kings of Persia, which make up the
full sum of 70.

The first King was Cyrus, who reigned three years, at the least; he began
the third. Dan. 10. 1.

The second, Artaxerxes, under whom the Jews are said to return; Ezr. 4. 12.
whose return was indeed under Cyrus. To him the enemies of the Jews wrote
their Letters to hinder the building of the Temple, when it was yet scarce
begun; Ezr. 4. 12. which was the second year after their return: Ezr. 3. 8.
wherefore he could be no other than Cambyses the son of Cyrus that reigned
in his fathers absence. We give him with the Hebrews, after his fathers death
6. years: the most that the greatest part of Chronologers bestow upon him, is
but 7.

The third, Assverus, he is mentioned, Ezr. 4. 7. and seeing Artaxerxes is
proved the immediate successor unto Cyrus, this Assuerus must needs be one that
came in time after Artaxerxes, though in that place of Ezra he be named before
him. Ezraes words have this meaning; The people of the Land discouraged the
people of Judah, and troubled them in building all the days of Cyrus, unto the
days of Darius: for in the reign of Assuerus (Predecessor to Darius) in the
beginning of his reign they wrote an acousation against the Inhabitants of
Judah and Jerusalem. And (before that) in the days of Artaxerxes, Mithredath,
Tabeel and the rest of their Colleagues wrote, etc. Wherefore Tremelius looking
to the sense, does well render it, As in the days of Artaxerxes, Mithredath,
Tabeel, etc. had written.

I take this Assuerus to be Smerdis the Usurper: for where it is said, Dan.
11. 2. that before Xerxes three Kings shall stand up in Persia, they are not to
be reckoned from Darius Medus, notwithstanding he were spoken of in the first
verse, but from that time that the Angel spoke the words, being in the reign
of Cyrus: so as in saying, three Kings shall yet stand up, Cyrus cannot be
comprehended.

The 3. Kings therefore were Artaxerxes, (or Cambises) Assuerus, (or Smerdis)
and Darius. He reigned not a year.

The fourth King is Darius, Ezr. 4. 5. which is Darius Hystaspis: He is called
King of Ashur, Ezr. 6. 22. in the very same sense that Cyrus, Ezr. 5. 13. And
Artaxerxes. Nehem. 13. 6. are called Kings of Babel: for Ashur in that place is
taken for Babel, as it is also, Esaias 52. 4. Babylon, by the consent of all
Historians, being anciently a part of Assyria, and now in Darius hand, all
these Kingdoms joined together.

In the second year of his reign, he gave leave to build the Temple, Ezr. 4.
24. and the sixth year of his reign, he gave leave to build the Temple; Ezr.
4. 24. and the sixth year of his reign it was finished. Ezr. 5. 6. 15.

Darius that gave leave to build the Temple, must needs be Darius Hystaspis,
not Darius Nothns nor any other that come long after him: for,

1. It was one that reigned within very short time after the 70. years
expired; seeing Zachary in the second year of that Darius reign, brings in
the Angel speaking thus: Zach. 1. 12. How long wilt not thou have mercy on
Jerusalem, and on the Cities of Judah, with whom thou have been wroth these
70. years, and Zach. 7. 5. the Prophet says, When you fast and mourn in the
fifth and sixth Month, and these seauenty years, Which was spoken in the fourth
year of that Darius.

The Phrase, (these 70 years) must needs import that they were not long before
ended.

2. The age of Ezra, and of those to whom Haggai speaks, Hag. 2. 3. Which of
you saw the former house? will not suffer you to refer it to the times of
Darius Nothus.

Histories give this Darius 20. years, and so much the Computation of the 7.
weeks does warrant.

The fifth King was Artaxerxes, Ezr. 7. whom I take to be son to Darius
Hystaspis; This is that worthy Prince under whom Ezr. first found favor for
the house of God, Ezr. 7. and after him Nehemie had commission to build the
City and to settle a government there, Nehem. 1. Some 33. years of his reign
are set down, Nehem. 13. 6. In the 32. year of Artaxerxes King of Babylon, I
had returned to the King only at the end of a year, I got leave: of him is
meant, Ezr. 6. 14. they built and brought it to perfection, by the advice of
the God of Israel, and by the advice of Cyrus and Darius, and Artaxerxes King
of Persia. Artaxerxes is there (by anticipation) joined to his father Darius
Hystaspis, because the purpose of the holy Ghost was to set down all the
furtherers of the work together: for albeit the structure and edifice of the
house was made an end of in the sixth year of Darius; yet Artaxerxes by his
decree furnished the sacrifices and the vessels for the ministry of the house,
and other necessaries: As it follows in the next Chapter, Ezra 7. And so was
a coadiutor for the perfitting of the Temple. Such anticipations are common in
the Scripture. See Exodus 16. 33. 34. 35.

This decree of Artaxerxes was in the seventh year of his reign Ezr. 7. 7.
which is not to be taken the next year after the structure of the Temple,
finished in the sixth of Darius Hystaspis, as if by that it might be gathered
that Darius and Artaxerxes were all one; but some years after: for the very
first verse of the seventh Chapter of Ezra gives some kind of inckling that
there begins a new Story in the days of another King. Now, after these
things, in the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah
etc. went up from Babylon.

Further of the Kings of Persia you find nothing, save that, Nehem. 12. 22.
the Catalogue of the high Priests, is reckoned up till the Kingdom of Darius
King of Persia, which was the last Darius whom Alexander the great did conquer;
for Iaddua the high Priest there mentioned, is he that met Alexander. Therefore
to the Kings that succeed Artaxerxes I give among them the remainder of the
70. years, namely 26.

Great Zerxes I put not in this number, who spent his time in wars abroad,
whilst Artaxerxes did all at home: And therefore the holy Ghost has him not in
his Catalogue, Dan. 11. 2. he is named a fourth King; but that is in respect
of the Grecians. And were he King, or no King, all his years are swallowed up
in Darius his fathers, and his successors.

The next difficulty is in the Greek government more uncertain than the
former: for here we lack the light of the holy Scripture to go before us. And
all other accounts whether taken from Historians in the succession of the
Syrian Kings, the high Priests, the Macchabees, or the Ptolomies of Egypt,
etc, or from Astronomicall observations, and the Ecclipses reckoned up in
Ptolomie, or from the Olympicke games which cross this account of 490. years,
from the first of Cyrus to the destroying of Jerusalem, that is the word of
truth uttered by the Angel, are vain, and not to be believed.

This is certain that the first 70. years and the last 73. being known as
they are one as I have showed by Esaias, and the books of Ezra and Nehemie: the
other by the new Testament and Ecclesiastical Story, the interuenient time
cannot be unknown, though how to reckon each particular in so great variety
of Greek and Latin Historians, it be a thing impossible: wherefore let the
Greek government (accompting it to begin with Alexander, and to expire at
Cleopatraes death) have 321. years. Between Cleopatraes death, and the time
that our blessed Savior was borne, are commonly reckoned 26. years. Christ
lived 33. years and somewhat more: from his death to the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans are 40. years.

So then upon the whole matter, the 70. seauens that is 490. years, are thus
made up.

The Persian Monarchy held 70. years.

The Greek government was, 321.

From Cleopatraes death to the birth of Christ are, 26.

Christ lived, 33. years.

From this death to the destruction of Jerusalem, 40. years.

Total. 490.

A word now or two for a particular explication of the Text.

Wherein the Angel first lays down the sum of all, [verse. 24.] That
instead of 70. years captivity, wherein the Land lay desolate and kept her
Sabbaths, they shall dwell in the Land 7. times 70. years before the City and
Sanctuary shall have an end; so far does the mercy of God exceed his wrath:
within the compass of which time, (and even upon the point of the expiration
of it, some forty years before) Christ, the King, Priest and Prophet of his
Church, shall perform the work of our redemption: for he was to come the
second Temple standing, Hag. 2. 9.

The power of his Kingdom evident in abolishing sin, and bringing in
everlasting righteousness.

Sin he does abolish by mortifying and subduing the power of it by his death:
by pardoning and forgiving both the guilt and punishment, by the full and
all-sufficient satisfaction that he has made upon the Cross, who is the
propitiation for our sins, righteousness (everlasting righteousness, which
shall make us accepted of God for ever, and never can be lost as Adams was) he
does bring in* first, by the reckoning and imputing of his own righteousness
unto us, and making it ours through faith; whereby we are justified or held
just and righteous even in the strict and most exact Justice of God himself:
Secondly, by making us new creatures by the virtue of his resurrection.

Again, he is our Prophet, by whom only God speaks unto us in these latter
days, and in whom all visions and revelations have an end. Heb. 1. 1.

Lastly, he is our Priest, a Minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true
Tabernacle which the Lord pight and not man; who by his own blood entered once
into the holy place, heaven it self, purchasing everlasting redemption, and
abolishing thereby the unction of the Law. Hebr. 8. 2. and 9. 8. 12.

The sum of all being thus laid down, the Angel in that which follows
brancheth the whole seauenty seauens into three heads or three distinct periods
of time: From the going forth of the word, to restore and to build Jerusalem:
To wit, from the Edict of Cyrus, Ezr. 1. unto a Messiah (that is an anointed)
governor, meaning Nehemie set up in the twentieth of Artaxerxes, as we showed
before, shall be seven seauens which make 49. years [1. part of verse. 25]

In this period are comprehended all things that fell out concerning the
re-edifying and furnishing of the Temple.

And of this I understand that which the Jews say, Io. 2 20. forty and six
years was this Temple a building: which is true, accompting the beginning at
the third of Cyrus; for from the Edict of Cyrus one year must be given them to
consult about their business being of so great weight and importance. In the
second it is like they took their journey from Babylon to Judea is some 4.
months travail: Ezr. 7. 8. So grant a year and a half for their return.
The second year after their return, the foundation of the Temple was laid and
somewhat proceeded in Ezr. 3. 8. So as till that time, there might be 3. years
from Cyrus Edict. Thence to the twentieth of Artaxerxes, are 46. years more:
for though the Edifice and structure were made an end of in the sixth of Darius,
there wanted yet houses for the Priests and other necessaries, which were not
added till about the time of Nehemie.

The Jews could not by that speech understand any Temple built by Herod, but
this second Temple: for this is it that was standing in the days of Christ,
Hagg. 2. 9.

The second period is, three score and two seauens, (434. years) wherein a
Governor being once set up, street and ditch (that is the compass of the
wall) shall again be built. [2. part. verse. 25.] These 434. years begin in
that twentieth of Artaxerxes, when Nehemie was made the Ruler, with commission
to build the City; which times, says the Angel, shall be troublesome: for
so they were, both during the time of the building of the walls; whereof, see
the book of Nehemiah, and during the whole time from thence unto the end. In
the third period are two things distinguished. First, is the subversion of
their government. The Governor which is so to be set over them from among
themselves, one of their brethren shall be cut off: there shall be nothing to
him, or he shall have nothing, no more to do there; all that form of
Government shall utterly be done away. [1. part. verse. 26.]

And this is precisely laid to be the first work that the seauentieth seven
should bring forth: for, After 62. seauens necessarily implies, upon the
beginning of the seauentieth.

The second is the destruction of the City and Sanctuary by a foreign
enemy, the Roman Army. By whom the Judgments of God as an innundation or
over flowing of mighty waters, shall suddenly and violently break in upon
them, by most cruel and deadly war (for there perished in the siege 1100.
thousand Jews, besides 90. thousand taken Captives) till they be brought to
utter ruin, that extreme desolation, (so much the plural does import) which
God from all eternity has precisely purposed and decreed. [2. part of verse
26.]

This where in the weight of all lies may justly require a distinct
consideration severally and by it self. Wherefore it pleases the holy Ghost
in the 27. verse to express both the fruit that should come of it, and the
time when all this shall be done.

The fruit: Christ our Lord shall play the man, that one seven mightily,
valiantly and Giant like (so the Hebrew (...)
word does signify) confirming the Covenant with many, to wit, those that are
his. [1. part of verse. 27.] What Covenant? The Covenant of grace, of
forgiveness of sins, of reconciliation and everlasting righteousness: All
which the holy Ghost said before. verse. 24.

And how did he so mightily confirm the same? He did confirm it mightily,
both in respect of the Jews, and of the converted Gentiles. In respect of the
Jews, by that Christ was to work within the compass of these weeks the
rare, wounderfull, and extraordinary vengeance that he took upon his enemies,
the people that crucified and put him unto death: whose Temple and City that
stood so long and were so renowned, he caused for this their fault to be razed
and made even with the ground, Luke 13. 34. 35. and 19. 43. 44. whereby he
manifestly declared himself to be the Lord of glory.

To the believing Gentiles he did mightily confirm the covenant, by removing
the maine rub that lay in their way, and hindered the giving of their names to
Christ: Whilst they saw not only the City where our Lord was crucified to
flourish; but the ceremonial shadows to be frequented which did obscure and
drown the truth of his coming in the flesh. And this end Julian the Apostata
had before his eyes, when in despite of the Christian name, he commanded the
re-edifying of the Temple.

The time, is in the midst of that week [2 part of verse. 27.] Peradventure
the work of the cutting of the anointed Governor was doing the former half
week; the first 3. years and a half. And indeed he that reads Josephus shall
find it fell out so: for about the 9th. year of Nero, (which was 7. years
before the destruction of the City) Albinus the Roman Governor there, by his
monstrous pilling, polling and other cruelty, did as Josephus says, sow the
seed of the Cities overthrow: And in the twelfth of Nero, within less than
four year after that, Agrippa the last Governor that the Jews had, from
among themselves was driven out of the City; whereupon Josephus says, The
City was without a Ruler to guide it.

And so, you have the Messiah cut off, and the Government of the City quite
extinct in the very instant of 3. year and a half, if it were necessary to
fly to that.

But there is no such necessity: The Hebrew word signifies part of a time as
well as half. Wherefore the sense may well be, in part, that is, during the
residue, the remainder of that seauentieth week, after the anointed Governor
cut off, (how long or shorttime soever the same be in doing,) he will perform
the things mentioned in the second part of the former verse: which for the
greater certainty, are here reitterated [in the last part of verse 27.] not
altogether in the same words: but so as the one of these two verses brings
light unto the other: for,

1. Instead of destroying City and Sanctvary, verse. 26. he says here in the
27. verse, He shall make to cease sacrifice and oblation, as needs they must
when the City and Temple are destroyed. In right they ceased upon the death of
Christ; but now they shall cease infact.

2. Instead of a foreign enemy doing the same by war, verse 26. he
puts in this verse, the wing or Legions of the Roman Army, laying desolate;
for wing was a proper term of the Roman warfare. Whose Armies are called
abominable, because they were Infidels, and worshipped Idols.

And this to be the sense of the place; beside the Angels thus suting of these
things, you may see by comparing the three Evangelists that speak of this
History: for where Math. 24. 25. and Mark. 13. 14. Christ says, When ye see
the abhomimation of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the
holy place where it should not: Luke interprets it thus, When ye shall see
Jerusalem compassed about of Armies, then know the desolation thereof is at
hand. Luke 21. 20. And so these words are but the same in sense and substance
that was in the former verse, which said, all this should be done by war.

3. Instead of inundation or ouerflowing of calamities, verse. 26. here you
have a pouring forth of all Gods Judgments at once, as if the windows of
Heaven should be opened as they were at the flood.

4. Where the 26. verse does speak of desolation to the end of the war,
those words expound these of the twenty seventh, unto utter destruction.

5. Preciseness of desolation, in the 26. verse, is somewhat more clearly
uttered in the 27. unto utter destruction precisely determined.

So one of these notes the greatness; the other the certainty of the
desolation.

The Rabbinicall Doctors seek for a knot in a rush, when they enquire upon
this place how long this desolation shall continue, and when the precise
determinate time shall have an end: for the period of all that Daniel here
speaks of, is the end of the seauentieth seven. Howbeit in other Scriptures,
Dan. 12. 11. 12. Math. 23. 38. 39. Luke 21. 24. Romans 11. 25. 26. that precise
determinate time of the Jews desolation is precisely prophesied and foretold:
but every place has his proper interpretation.

To close up this Treatise because it may be of great use for the clearing of
this and many other hard and obscure passages; I will here set down the just
periods of time from the beginning of the World to the dissolution of all
things, as they are to be gathered in holy Scripture.

First, from the Creation to the Flood, are years, 1656. manifest by the
years of the fathers before the Flood. Genesis 5. and 11.

Secondly, from the Flood unto the Promise made to Abraham, 426. for from the
Flood to Terah, are 221. Terah begat Abraham at 130. At 70. he begat children:
Genesis 11. 26. But that was Nahor his first borne, though Abraham for honor sake
be named first. Abraham he begat at 130. as appears in that Terah dyed at
205. Genesis 11. 32. when Abraham was 75. Genesis 12. 4.

The promise made to Abraham was at 75. for then and not before he left his
own Country Charran (which was his Country as well as Vr, or the Valley of the
Chaldeans, and both in Mesopotamia) for Canaan Genesis 12. 4. And Exodus 1^. 4. it
is said, the pregrination of the children of Israel in Aegipt, meaning both
there and in the Land of Canaan, where they were alike strangers) was 430.
years, So as the promise and the entrance into the Land begin together. Also
if Terah had not been dead before the promise, he (which none will say) should
have received the promise of Christ to come of his seed as well as Abraham:
for doubtless, Abraham, as a Prophet of God would not have concealed it from
him.

Of necessity therefore two callings of Abraham are to be distinguished: one in
Ur of the Chaldeans, which being passed over, Genesis 11. is laid down, Genesis 15.
7. and Stephen speaks of it, Act. 7. 2. 3. The second after his fathers
death, Genesis 12. 1. Which place is to be translated not Jehovah had said, but
Jehovah did say, as a new commandment to go on his journey with an addition
of the promise. And this Stephen mentions. Act 7. 4.

Thirdly, from the promise to the giving of the Law, 430. Gal. 3. 17. Which are
the 430. years of peregrination, Exodus 12. 40. In 400. whereof Abraham's seed
was afflicted, Genesis 15. 13. They shall entreat thy seed evil, 400. years.
This affliction begins at Ismaels persecution of Isaac, Genesis 21. 9. Gal. 4.
29. and continues to their deliverance out of the house of bondage, the
setuitude of Aegipt. The persecution of Isaac was not at his birth, it must be
when he was of some understanding, and the computation of time draws it to
about the sixth year of his age; which was just 30. years from the promise.
Thus are those three texts Gal. 3. 17. Exodus 12. 4. and Genesis 15. 13. cleared.
Of these 430. years, 215. were spent in the Land of Canaan; for from the 75.
year of Abraham to Isacks birth, are 25. Isaac was 60. when Jacob was borne,
Genesis 25. Jacob went down into Egypt at 130. Genesis 47. 9. So only 215. are
left for Egypt.

Fourthly, from the Law, or coming out of Egypt, to the building of the
Temple. 480.

1. Kings 6. 1. Their sum arises thus.

In the Desert, 40. Deuteronomy. 1. 3. Joshua 17.

The Conquest and partition of the Land, take up 7. of it: As it is proved by
Calebs age, Josh. 14. 7. 10. for the Land was divided the 45. year after Moses
sent him from Kadesh Barnea to view the Land; out of which deduct 38. years
that the Children of Israel remained in the wilderness after Gods sentence
upon Calebs return, and their remain 7. 480. years from the Passover to the
Temple, and he ruled the other 10. in all 17. As appears in that of those,
all but 17. are in the time of other Rulers, and that remain can be cast upon
none but him. Judge. 339. That is to say, Othniel. 40. Ehud and Shamgar 80.
Debora. 40. Gedeon. 4. Abimelech. 3. Tolah. 23. Iair. 22. Ieptha. 6. Ibtsan. 7.
Elon. 16. Abdon. 8. Sampson. 20. Elie 40.

Acts 13. 19. it is said, God gave them Judges as it were 450. years, unto
Samuel the Prophet he says, as it were, or in a manner, for in proper
Chronicle and common supputation, it was 339. But Judges that within the
compass of that time did tyrannize and oppress them, took up 111. years;
namely, Cushan 8. Moab 18. Sisera 20. Midian 7. Ammon 8. Philistines 40. Saul
40. Act. 13. 21. where Paul says, Afterward they desired a King, and God gave
unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the Tribe of Benjamin, 40 years. As
if he should say, all this from the Judges was 40. years: So comprehending the
wholetime from the death of Elie, as well the interim till Samuel meddled with
the government, which was not in 20. years after (...) 1. Sam. 7. 3. as the
whole time of his government and of Saul's reign, being 20 years more.

David 40. Solomon 4. 1. Kings 6. 1.

Fifthly, the Temple stood before it was burnt by Nebuchadnetzar. 408.

To be gathered thus.

To Salomons death 36. for he reigned 40. in all.

The Kings of Judah after him reigned 372. as the years are truly collected
by Tremellius in the Argument of the first and second Book of Kings. The 390.
years that Ezechiel bare the iniquity of the house of Israel, Ezech. 4.
whereof 40. (part of those 390. verse. 9.) were for the house of Judah, does no
way cross this account of the Kings that succeeded Solomon; for neither do
those 390. years begin when Jeroboam drew Israel away: but from about the 28.
year of Salomons reign, at what time waxing old, he was led to the worship
of false Gods: 1. King. 11. and all Israel ran headlong into Idolatry;
neither do they end with the destruction of the Temple and the City, but in
the last and final carrying away of the poor remain, by Nebuzaradan as
appears, Ezech. 5. 4. which was some five year after. And the 40. year, of
Judah, are from the eighteenth year of Iosia, when the covenant was renewed;
2. King. 23. 23. from which the people immediately fell away.

Sixthly, from the burning of the Temple to the Edict of Cyrus to build it anew.

And so adding the first 18. years of Nebuchadnetzar, you have the 70. years
Captivity.

Seauenthly, from that Edict to the destruction of the Temple by the Romans.
490.

Which are Daniels seauens, Dan. 9. whereof the first 49. years are for the
full finishing of the temple and all the furniture thereof.

Eighthly, from a second and the final desolation thereof, being endeavored to
be re edifyed by Julian the Apostata in despite of the Christian name, about
Anno. 360. after Christ, till such time as the Jews acknowledging Christ the
Lord, shall set up a glorious Church at Jerusalem again, not of wood or stone,
nor for any Legal worship; but for the spiritual service of God in Christ,
are years. 1233. Dan. 12. 11. 12.

Ninthly, from thence to the full coming in of the Gentiles, the certain time
is not foretold, unless (which I dare not say) any thing may be gathered from,
Revel. 20. 4.

But the tenth and last period is, that after the fullness of the Gentiles once
come in, the generation then living shall not pass away, till all things have
an end. Math. 24. 34.

The Prophecy of Hoshea.
Chapters. 1. 2.
CHAP. 1.
1. The Word of Jehovah that came unto Hoshea the son of Beery in the days
of Vzziah, Iotham, Achaz, Hezechiah, Kings of Judah: and in the days of
Jeroboam the son of Ioash, King of Israel.

1. THe Title or Inscription sets forth the Author of the Prophecy, God:
the Preacher or publisher thereof, Hoshea: the time that he executed his
Prophetical function, 43. years at the least: for so many there are from the
very last year of Jeroboam the son of Ioash, to the first year of
Hezechias, to be reckoned in this sort. The last year of Jeroboam was the 39.
of Uzzia or Azaria; Uzzia or Azaria reigned 13. years more (52. in all) Iotham
(after him) 25. Achaz (Hezechiahs father) 14.

The knowledge of the time helps much, and brings a great light to the
understanding of the Prophecy, because of the many accidents that fell within
that compass in the Kingdom of Israel to the Kings thereof, of whom he makes
often mention, and lived himself to see most of the things that here he
prophecieth, and so was able the better to make use of it unto the people;
under that one of Jeroboam the son of Ioash (when our Prophet first began)
all the Kings of Israel are comprehended in this place, as many as reigned from
him to Hezechiah.

The authority of this Prophet cannot be called in question: He is cited by our
Savior Christ, Math. 9 13. and 12. 7. by the Evangelist writing by Gods
Spirit; Math. 2. 15. and lastly, by the Apostle Paul, 1. Cor. 15. 55. and Romans
25. 26. where he voucheth him by name.

2. The beginning of that which Jehovah spoke by Hoshea: And Jehovah said unto
Hoshea; Go take unto thee a Hebr. A Wife of whoredoms, and children of
whoredoms.
Wife, an Harlot, and children begot in fornication; for the Land has greatly
gone a whoring From after Jehovah.
, departing from Jehovah.

3. So he went and took Gomer, a Daughter.
woman of Diblaim: who conceived and bare him a son.

4. Then said Jehovah unto him, call his name Izreel: for yet a little while
and I will visit the Bloods.
slaughters of Izreel upon the house of Iehu, and will make the Kingdom to
cease in the house of Israel.

5. And it shall be in that day: that I will break the bow of Israel, because
of the valley of Izreel.

2. The sum of the Prophecy, is a fearful denouncing of Gods judgments
against the people for their sins, and a sweet publishing of mercies to a
small remnant, the little handful of Gods Elect, it is all typical or
declaratiue of the Type.

The typical part, which has also an application going with it) in the three
first Chapters, under two types; whereof the first (in the first and second
Chapter) is of a Wife, an Harlot, and Children begot in fornication; whom the
Prophet is willed to take, not as though he should take the mother and them
together (which could not be, they being borne after) but because from a
wicked and unclean mother, he was to have base and misbegotten Issue.

Whether the Prophet in truth took such a wife, which God commanding, cannot
be dishonest; or as rather must be thought by way of similitude only and
comparing himself with a man marrying in that sort, to tax the peoples
infidelity and falling away from God by spiritual adultery with their false
Gods and Idols.

This Wife, an Harlot figureth the Kingdom of the Israelites that went a
whoring from God, their lawful Husband, to whom they were espoused.

3. She is called Gomer, that is to say, entierty or perfection; for that the
whole body of Israel was vouchsafed the honor of this spiritual marriage.

She is said to be a woman of Diblaim, or out of Diblah, that wast and huge
wilderness which you read of, Ezech. 6. 24. to show that, not their merit,
but Gods free and gracious goodness advanced them to that estate and dignity.

The three Children begot in fornication, figure the judgments which by so
many degrees were to light upon this people, every one heavier than the other.

4. The first Child is a son, whose name was Izreel, by the name of the ten
Tribes Mother-Citie: figuring the ruin of Iehues house, and of the Kings of
Israel in his line, which is set forth.

First, by the circumstance of time, that it should come quickly to pass: for
Zachariah, Ieroboams son, reigned but 6. months; then Shallum the son of
Iabesh conspired against him, slew him, and reigned in his stead.

Secondly, by the effects, that from that time forward God will weaken the
force of the whole State and Kingdom, by home dissentions and foreign wars.

Thirdly, by the cause of this judgment, because says he, of the valley of
Izreel, that is, the slaughters and massacres which Iehu made there; which,
albeit God had commanded and was well pleased with, yet for that he did it not
with an upright heart, God justly punished it in his posterity.

6. Afterward she conceived again and bare a Daughter, and Jehovah said unto
him, call her name Loruhamab: for I I will not add any more to
will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should any way
forgive them.

7. But on the house of Judah I will have mercy, and will save them by Jehovah
their God: and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by
horses, nor by horsemen.

6. The second Child is a Daughter, named Loruhamab, that is not obtaining
mercy, it figureth the utter desolation of the ten Tribes, begun by Tiglah
Pileser, King of Ashur, when he carried away captive the Reubenites, Gadites,
and half tribe of Manasse. 1. Chron. 5. 26. and perfited by Salmanaser, who
utterly overthrew the residue of the Kingdom of Israel, 1. King. 17.

This age is compared to a Daughter, because from that time forward, after the
bow of Israel, that is, all their power and strength so broken, they should be
no more able to defend themselves, than if they were a commonwealth of women.
Their misery in this behalf you have aggrauated two ways.

First, that it shall be without hope of restitution. God will not have mercy
on them to pardon their sins and graciously to restore them after they are
once carried Captives.

7. Secondly, by Gods contrary dealing with the house of Judah, whom the
Aramites, and they confederating together did most maliciously seek to ruin.

These he says he, will save for his mercies sake, and shows how and by
whom; by Jesus Christ true God and true man, the ground and foundation of the
Covenant, and of all Gods promises, whom in the fullness of time God would send
among them: not by their own forces, nor by any foreign helps. The meaning
is, the Tribe of Judah, notwithstanding their captivity in Babylon, from the
which he will set them free, shall continue a Tribe still, and certain some
principality, and form of Government till Shiloh (which is his son) do come
and that the Gentiles believe in him.

8. Now when she had weined Loruhamah: She conceived and bare a soune.

9. Then said Jehovah, call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people neither
will I be yours.

10. Yet the number of the Children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea
which cannot be measured, nor told: and instead of that it was said unto them,
ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, ye are the sons of the
living God Almighty.

11. When the Children of Judah and the Children of Israel, gathering themselves
together and setting over them one head, shall come up out of the Land: for
great shall the day of Izreel be.

8. The third Child which she bare after the weaning of the former, that is to
say, after that the patience of God had long expected for their conversion, and
found no amendment, but a desperate going on in sin, is a son.

9. Loammi, not my people, figuring the final reiection and casting off of the
whole Nation of the Jews for refusing 2. Posit. Reiection.
the Lord of life, (whom the Father sent to save them) that they should be no
longer his Church and people.

10. But the sharpness of this sentence, the Prophet, by way of correction of
his speech does qualify and remper with most heavenly comforts, the sweet
promises of the Gospel: for,

First, howsoever the whole Nation of the Jews is thus to be abandoned, yet
at the last a Church shall be gathered 5. Posit. Call.
of them through grace, and that no small multitude, but a number numberless;
when looking with sorrow and true repentance upon him whom they have thrust
through: they shall be made not his people only, but the sons of the living
God.

Secondly, the Gentiles shall together with them embrace the Gospel; for so is
this place expounded: Romans 9. 44 Posit. All nations embracing Christ.
24. 25. and 1. Pet. 2. 10. yet of necessity the calling of the Gentiles here
pointed at, must be intended that which is after the Jews conversion; but that
serves well to warrant the first inceptions of their calling: to which purpose
the Apostles do there apply it.

Thirdly, the ten Tribes as well as Judah shall be vouchsafed this honor,
to be called to the participation 8. Posit. Ten Tribes.
of Christ.

Fourthly, the union of them into one body and one Religion; 29. Posit. One
Kingdom.
for they shall all submit to one head Christ, and make but one Kingdom.

Fifthly, their return unto Jerusalem again coming out 23 Posit. Dwell in
their Country.
of the Countries whether they were dispersed: there to re-edifie and set up
his spiritual worship and service.

Sixthly, the greatness of this work: for great, says he, shall the day of
Izreel be; great, in regard of their great distress, the sorest time of
affliction that ever was; great, in regard of their great delivery, far to be
preferred before their deliverance out of Egypt; great, in regard of the great
destruction of their great enemy that shall fall before them. Lastly, (which
it seems the Prophet here does specially respect) great in regard of the
great and 38 Posit. Multitude of of belieuers.
marvelous increase of the Church, the plentiful seed which God will sow in
the same (as Esaias did also prophecy, Esaias 49. 50. 51. etc. multiplying them
with men as it were with flocks of sheep, Ezech. 36. 38. Ier. 31. 37. which is
the number numberless, whereof he spoke in the former verse.

Seauenthly, heerevpon a new name is given to this people to be called Izreel,
or the seed of Gods own sowing: And so by a Paranomasia or allusion of
speech, he does elegantly open another, and a more sweet etymology of that
name which before served for the threatening of Judgment, here it is used to
note the promises of grace from God, as it is Chapter. 2. 16. which place does
answer unto this, and opens the meaning of it.

The received opinion is, that the second Child Loruhamah figureth the
captivity of the Reubenites, Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh, and the third
child Loammi, the captivity of the rest of the ten Tribes: But that cannot
stand: for,

First, in the second Child he expressly names the whole house of Israel,
verse. 6.

Secondly, he opposes them to the house of Judah, verse. 7. not to the residue
of those tribes of Israel.

Thirdly, the judgment threatened in the third Child, is after Jehovah Christ
his coming into the world, by whom Judah should be saved; whilst the other
remained Captives, verse. 7. Therefore the captivity of the ten tribes must go
before the third Child borne.

Fourthly, the reiection (spoken of in the third Child) does properly and
aptly concern the Jews that were at Christ's coming, not those led away by
Salmanazar.

Fifthly, the promise of restoring Judah no less than Israel shows that they
had their part in the former threatenings.

Sixthly, the mother of these Children is called Gomer, that is to say,
entiertie or perfection, verse. 3. The very name teaching us that the type
extends as well to the tribe of Judah as to the other tribes. And therefore
they must needs be meant by the third Child, and Consequently all Israel by
the second: upon this one thing well observed depends (in a manner) the true
understanding of the whole Prophecy; for hereby is evident that the three
first Chapters, and consequently the last four, which in effect are but an
explanation of the promises in the former, are to be referred to the Kingdom
of Christ to be set up among the Jews in the last days which we expect, and
is yet to come.

CHAP. 2.
1. Say unto your brethren, O my people, and to your sisters, O thou that have
obtained mercy.

2. Plead with your Mother, plead, how she is not my wife, neihther am I her
husband: That she put away her fornications out of her sight, and her
adulteries from between her breasts.

3. Lest I strippe her naked, and set her as the day she was borne; and
disposing her as in a wilderness, and setting her as in a dry land, do make
her dye for thirst.

4. And show no mercy to her Children, for they be children Of Whoredoms.
be got infornication.

Hitherto of the Type: The Application stands of three parts; every one
expressing more clearly than other, the Peoples Apostasy, and falling away
from God: the miserable condition which this Apostasy should bring upon them,
and the gracious promise of restoring them again. All which things were so
handled in the three last verses of the former Chapter.

First, therefore is an exhortation to true repentance; for fear of Gods
judgments, uttered by an Apostrophe, or turning of the speech to the poor
remnant of Gods elect, 3. Posit. Remnant.
whereby is given to understand, that there shall still remain a holy seed in
the midst of this dereliction, whom the Prophet here inuiteth to a most
religious and holy duty.

That by wholesome admonitions they would stay and hold up their declined
Synagogue from utter falling away, O you my people of either sort, not of the
tribe of Judah only, but even of the other tribes; for to them also the promise
does belong, Ier. 37. etc. Ezech. 37. 16. etc. and elsewhere) as many of you as
shall obtain grace to escape out of the slavery of sin and Satan, into the
glorious liberty of the sons of God, stir up one another by holy
exhortation.

2. And all of you together stay and hold up the declined Synagogue and Church
of Israel; By reproving her for her sins, those spiritual whoredoms that
have broken the marriage bond between God and her.

3. And by threatening betimes, before her fall and final desolation come, the
Judgments of God, both upon her self, by an utter depriving her of all his
gifts and graces, (which in the Scriptures are compared with waters, and the
lack of them with the dry and barren desert.)

And upon her Children the particular members of that Synagogue, who love and
live in the adulteries of their mother.

With some hope nevertheless of grace and of forgiveness, if she return and
seek the Lord, as by the word least is secretly given to understand.

5. For their mother has played the harlot, she that conceived them has dealt
shamefully: for she said, I will go after my Lovers, that give me my bread
and my waters, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drinkings.

6. Therefore, behold, I will hedge thy way with thorns, and Wall, a wall.
rear a wall that she shall not find her paths.

7. And though she follow after he Lovers, yet shall she not come at them,
though she seek them, yet shall she not find them: that at the length she
shall say, I will go and return, to that my former husband, for then was it
better with me, then now.

8. For she knows not that I gave unto her, the corn and the new wine and
the oil: also that I multiplied unto her silver and gold wherewith they made
Baal.

9. Therefore will I return and take away my corn in the time thereof: and
will deliver my wool and my flax, To have covered.
which should have covered her nakedness.

10. That I may uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers: and no man
shall deliver her out of my hand.

11. And I will cause all her mirth to cease, her festival, her new moon, her
Sabbath: and all her solemnity.

12. And I will lay waste her vines and her figtrees: whereof she has said:
These are my rewards that my Lovers have given me: and I will make them a
forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.

13. So will I visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burnt incense
to them, and decking her selfewith her earing and her jewel, went after her
Lovers: but forgot me, the speech of Jehovah.

5. In the second part, you have a declaration of their sin and of the miseries
inflicted for the same, which are the reason why God so calls upon his
people, to use this exhortation.

The sin is expressed to be her going a whoring impudently and shamelesly
after strange Gods and People, contrary to the duty of a Wife. Not only so,
but a wicked settling of her self to the like sins hereafter, all mixed with
extreme ingratitude; in that she ascribed unto these strange ones the thanks
of all she did possess.

6. Then come the miseries inflicted for the same, wherein Gods purpose was to
keep her by crosses and afflictions (as unruly beasts by walls and fenses are
kept within their pastures) from being able to fulfill her desire of committing
fornication with them.

7. Though never so much she hunt and follow after it, that by this means
breaking her obstinate and froward heart, she may come unto repentance, and
betake her self to God her lawful husband, whom to her loss she had forsaken.

8. And the better to imprint these things in their mind he repeateth both the
sin, their idolatry and blind ingratitude, that not only would not know the
hand from whence so many and so great blessings came, but to the dishonor of
God bestowed them upon Idols.

And the miserable condition which this should bring upon them: for, 4. Posit.
Desolation.


9. Stripping them of all the comforts and commodiof this life, and freeing his
creatures out of the possession of those vniustowners, who so wretchedly abused
them to a wrong and contrary end then God has given them: for,

10. He will expose them to public shame and infamy.

11. Secondly all outward form of Gods worship, (the solace, and joy of their
life shall be taken from them.

12. Thirdly, the Country they took such pleasure in, not looking up to God
that gave it, their fruitful and pleasant Gardens, Orchards, and Vineyards,
shall be turned into a wilderness.

All which things we see have fallen more heaully upon this people, than ever
they did upon any nation.

13. Idolatry (whereunto he resorteth to show how just the sentence is,) the
cause of all this, which she so diated on, thinking no pain too much, all
cost too little, to compass her desires, and followed it so hard making a
trade of it, that transported with blind love, she forgot her lawband.

By this of Idols, which he mentions according to the state of those times,
is meant, the worship of false Gods whatsoever, as all worship is that looks
not to God in Christ.

14. Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the Wilderness,
and will speak to her heart.

15. And I will give her her Uineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor,
for the door of hope: that she shall sing there as in the days of her youth,
that is, as in the day when she came out of the Land of Egypt.

14. The third part of the Chapter has a promise of the Jews restoring,
uttered Allegorically by an elegant allusion to the whole manner and course
that it pleased God to use for the bringing of that people into the Land of
Canaan when they came out of Egypt.

First, the power of his spirit moving her as he sent Moses, and Aaron to
inuit them whilst they were slaves in Egypt.

Secondly, the sore distress she shall be in, upon making 16. Posit. Sore
distress.
head to repair to her own home, As the Israelites were when God led them
into the wilderness, and there made them to wander so up and down, see Ezech.
20 35. 36.

Thirdly, the promises of God upholding her the whilst, as his word and the
Symbol of his presence strengthend the Israelites in their toylesome iourneyes.

15. Fourthly, the bringing of her into her own country again, freed and
delivered out of that desert, those troubles 23. Posit. Dwell in their Country.
and calamities which he spoke of the sorest time of affliction, (as Daniel
prophesies, Dan. 12. 1.) that ever was since there was a nation unto that day:
This the Prophet sets before their eyes, by pointing at the ports and gates
whereby this people, having wandered first a long time in the wilderness, were
brought from the desert beyond Jordan unto the hither side: for the first door
and entrance as it were into the Land of promise which they so hoped and wished
for, after they were once passed Jordan, was the valley of Achor, famous for
the story of Achan stoned there.

Fifthly, faith, hope, and spiritual blessings, a pledge and earnest penny of
the promised inheritance: as the first 36. Posit. Spiritual graces.
footing over Jordan and the fruitfulness of those soyles, lifted up their
hearts with a certain expectation of a through possessing of the whole country.

Sixthly, the joy of the Church restored to her ancient seats, as both men and
women, Miriam and the maidens song when they came out of Egypt.

And so he lifts up their hearts to the waiting for of another, and a more
famous deliverance, when as in the year of Iubile, they shall not only
return to their possessions again, but have the same accompanied in their
native soil with spirtuall freedom from sin and Satan, and with such noble
graces, and first fruits of the spirit.

16. And it shall be in that day the speech of Jehovah, that thou shall call
me my Husband, and shall call me no more 40. Posit. Joy.
my Baal.

17. For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth: yea, they shall
be no more remembered by their name.

18. And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the
field, and with the foul of the heaven, and with that which creeps upon the
earth, and breaking the bow and the sword, and the battle out of the Land, I
will make them to lie down in safety.

19. And I will espouse thee unto me for ever: I will, I say, espouse thee unto
me in righteousness, and in judgment, in kindness and in mercy.

20. And will espouse thee into me in faith, that thou may know Jehovah.

21. It shall be also in that day, that I will hear the speech of Jehovah, I
will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth.

22. And the earth shall hear the Corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and
they shall hear Izreel.

23. For I will sow her for me in the Land, and I will have mercy upon
Loruhamah: and will say unto Loammi, thou art my people, and he shall say, my
God.

16. In the fourth part of the Chapter are Evangelical promises made unto the
Jews being restored and brought home.

First, her receiving of Christ: acknowledging him 5. Posit. Call.
for her just and lawful Husband, and calling him by that name.

17. Secondly, Reformation of the Church from all 34. Posit. Purity.
corruption in Gods service, noted by that one of rooting our Idolatry.

18. Thirdly, the Churches safety through God special 41. Posit. Safety of the
Church.
care and protection, making the very beasts of the field and all things, to
be at peace with them.

19. Fourthly, he will communicate unto them all good both the fountain of
good, and the streams flowing from it.

The fountain is the betrothing unto Christ, that is, their spiritual
conjunction with him, which the Apostle calls a taking of them to. Romans 11.
15. enlarged.

First, by the constancy and eternity of it. 43. Posit. Perpetuity.


Secondly, by the fundamental cause, the righteousness and mercy of God, to
whom in my judgment these words are to be referred: As Romans 3. 24, 25, 26. 1.
Pet. 1. 1. 1. Ioh. 1. 9. But if you list to understand them otherwise then is
this spiritual conjunction with Christ here secondly enlarged by the gifts
and graces going there withal, and which he will bestow upon them, which are
of two sorts.

First, righteousness and judgment, then kindness and mercy; one noting the
sincerity and integrity of their ways: the other, their prompt and cheerful
performance of all brotherly duties. But the former sense agrees better.

20. Thirdly, by the instrument or means of apprehending all this, and making
it their own; even faith which is the 26. Posit. Spiritual graces.
true and saving knowledge of God.

21. The streams flowing from this fountain of our conjunction with God, are
all manner of blessings.

First, temporal, in the fruitfulness of their Land: all the creatures in
heaven and in earth conspiring as it were 17. Posit. Fruitfulness of the Land.
together, and in their kind desiring it at his hands.

22. God will furnish abundantly for the Churches good the remnant of that
Izreel, whereof he spoke before Chapter 1. 2. which are her Children of the
seed of Iaacob, begotten through faith in Christ.

22. Secondly, Gods covenant with the whole Church, the natural mother of the
true Israel and with her children, who^ 35. Posit. Covenant.
before he said, he would have no pity of; nor they should be none of his:
But now he promises to except those remnant, the true griffes, and Plants
wherewith he will sow his Church.

And so have you admirably set forth the beauty of the holy City, new
Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, furnished as a Bride trimmed
for her husband, Reu. Chapt. 21. 23. that is of the Church of the Jews when
they shall embrace Christ.

CHAP. 3.
1. Afterward Jehovah said unto me, yet go, love a woman beloved of a
friend, and playing the adultresse: Such as is Iehouahs love toward the
Children of Israel, and they look to other Gods, and love flaggons of Grapes.
wine.

2. So I bought her me for fifteen shekels of silver; and for an homer and a
half of Barley.

3. And I said unto her, many days shall thou abide for me, play not the
harlot, nor be another man's: likewise will I for thee.

4. For many days shall the children of Israel abide without a King, and
without a Prince, and without sacrifice, and without a statue, and without an
Ephod, and without Images.

5. Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their
God, and David their King: and Shall fear to Jehovah.
fearfully shall come to Jehovah and his goodness in the last days.

1. The second Type not much unlike former, together with the declaration of
the Type, are both in this Chapter.

For the Type he takes a woman espoused, and to be married, but long put off
for her adulteries.

As God has loved and betrothed the Israelites, but for their idolatries a
great while neglected them, whom yet in the end he will be pleased to join to
himself in spiritual marriage.

It rises in these degrees.

First, God in bidding the Prophet to love a woman that had played the
Adultresse, intimates his love and purpose to call them home, even when they
went a whoring after strange Gods, forsaking the true worship and service of
God in Christ.

That is meant after the manner of those times, by looking to other Gods and
loving bottles of wine: for in those Sacrifices to Idols, the manner was to
drink wine abundantly.

Secondly, the Prophet bought her, which I interpret to be the setting apart
of a remnant, whom he 3. Posit. Remnant.
would afterward call with a holy calling and marry unto himself.

3. The price he paid 15. pieces of silver, and an homer and a half of Barley:
under that the Law requires for a bond slave, Exodus 21. 32. (and slaves only
were saleable) notes her vilde and base condition at the time, worse then any
slave, whether you consider her spiritual thraldom, or miserable dispersion
among the nations: for of all people in the world they are now the basest and
most contemptible.

3. Fourthly, the long continuance of this their slavery; having been in that
estate almost 1600. years since the destruction of their Temple and City by
Uespasian.

Fifthly, the utter desolation which shall be among them all that while: by
allusion to the law, Deuteronomy. 21. 13. 4. Posit. Desolation.


Sixthly, Gods promise to call them home by faith and true repentance at the
last, in that he is pleased to stay for 5. Posit. Call. (...)
them till the time that they also shall be joined in spiritual wedlock.

4. Thus far of the Type: The signification of the Type expresses clearly.

First, their long desolation and miserable state of things 4. Posit.
Desolation.
all that while, in that they shall have no form nor face of Church or Common
wealth, no, not of a corrupt, or depraved Church.

5. Secondly, the promise of their conversion, that in 5. Posit. Call.
the last days or last year as Ezechiel has it, Ezech. 38 8. they shall
embrace Christ their King (who is called here Jehovah and David) kiss the
Son, and with fear and trembling submit themselves unto his Kingdom, for
all the while they rejected him, they were without God in the world. Ephe. 2.
12.

CHAP. 4.
1. Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel: for Jehovah has a
controversy with the Inhabitants of the Land, because there is no
faithfulness, nor kindness, nor knowledge of God in the Land.

2. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and whoring: they do
break out, that From under their God.
Bloods touch bloods.
murders touch one another.

3. Therefore the Land shall mourn and every one that dwells therein shall
become feeble, With the beasts, and with foul.
both the beasts of the field, and the foul of the heaven: yea also, the
fishes of the Sea shall be taken away.

4. Yet let not a man contend, neither let a man rebuke: for thy people are as
they that contend with the Priest.

5. Therefore shall thou fall in the day, and the Prophet shall also fall with
thee in the night, and I will cut off thy Mother.

6. My people shall be cut off for lack of knowledge: because thou have
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee from being a Priest to me: and
seeing thou have forgotten the Law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

7. As they were increased, so they sinned against me: I will changs their
glory into shame.

8. They eat up the sin of my people: Therefore upon their iniquity do
they set their heart.

9. Wherefore there shall be like people, like Priests: when I shall visit
his ways upon him, and render unto him his doings.

10. For though they eat, yet shall they not have enough, though they commit
fornication, yet shall they not break forth in multitude: for they have left
of to observe Jehovah.

11. Whoredom, and wine, and new wine take away the heart.

12. My people ask counsel at their stock, that their staff may tell them:
for the spirit of fornication causes them to err; that they go a whoring,
From under their God.
turning from their God.

13. They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon
the hills under the Oak, and Poplar, and Elm, because the shadow thereof is
good: therefore your daughters play the harlots, and your spouses commit
adultery.

14. Should I not visit your daughters because they play the harlots, and your
spouses because they commit adultery? Because these with harlots do separate
things which they may sacrifice with whores: yes verily, the people that does
not understand shall be ruined.

1. Hitherto of the typical part of this Prophecy. That which is declaratiue
of the Type stands upon two parts, as the Type it self does.

First, the sins of the people and Gods judgments upon them for the same.

Secondly, the promise of grace, peace and reconciliation to a little remnant.

The former of the two he comprehends in three Sermons.

Whereof the first (in this fourth Chapter) has a notable reproof of the
Israelites sins, three in number: unfaithfulness, inhumanitie, ignorance of
God, and an enterlaced threatening of Judgments for the same.

Both first propounded, and afterward amplified and enlarged.

2. Their unfaithfulness and perfidious treachery: breaking all the duties of
the second Table, in most outrageous manner like a current or a stream that
cannot be kept within any bounds: insomuch that even bloodshed, and murder
were grown so common, that dead carcases lay by heaps one upon another.

3. But the punishment should be, a woeful calamity and general plague upon
the whole Land, and all the commodities of it.

4. Their barbarous inhumanity, noted to be so great that they can abide no
reprehension, so as it were but lost labor to go about to admonish them: They
are so fierce, that there is no dealing with them, but they do all manner of
wickedness, obstinately and with an high hand; and therefore are in as great
fault as those that hearken not to the Priest.

5. But since they will not be set to rights, they shall stumble and fall, and
that presently, both people and Prophet, one with another, yea their Kingdom
and mother City.

6. The ignorance as well of the people as of the Priests, makes that both
Priests and people shall be rejected.

The Priests, from their Priestly function, which they have so abused, for
their lips ought to have preserved knowledge, the people from being any more
his.

7. An unworthy thing that the Priests, especially should so much forget
themselves and sin so hainously against the Lord, by whom they were so much
advanced: But those that honor God, he will honor, and such as despise him,
shall be set light by.

8. They (which is horrible to imagine) because their liuelihood grows by the
sacrifices of the People, are so far from finding fault with the peoples
sins, that contrariwise all their heart and mind is to have them sin, and
as much as in them lies they bring in a license and impunity of sinning, to
serve their own bellies and ambitions, because by the peoples sacrifices for
sin, they have wherewith to maintain their gormandizing and filthy pleasures.

9. But both Priest and People shall smart for it and reap according as they
have sown.

11. To gormandizors and voluptuous livers, shall come famine and the plague,
wherewith themselves shall be consumed, as at the siege of Samaria, so far
shall they be from being full or multiplying.

11. Howsoever, their whordome and gurmondizing so take away their heart that
they heed not Gods threatenings, nor his judgments, though the same lie never
so much upon them, and that they are in the very midst of them.

12. Those that commit spiritual fornication and forsaking God, run a
whoring after Idols, in every place where they can meet with them: God will
pay it into their bosoms by home adulteries and fornications.

14. To the ruin of them and their families, justly and righteously; when as
they are carried so headlong to adulrie, that they stick not to make choice at
home of the best and sweetest morsels, which under color of religion, they
devour openly with their strumpets.

15. Though thou Israel play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend: And go not
ye to Gilgal, nor go up to Bethauen, neither swear Jehovah lives.

16. For as an unruly heifer Israel is unruly: now will Jehovah feed them as a
Lamb in a large place.

17. Ephraim is consociate to Bugges.
Idols, let him alone.

18. Their bibbing of wine is unruly: they In going a whoring they go a
whoring.
continually go a whoring, they love give ye, her Shidde.
protectors are ignominy it self.

19. The wind shall bind her up in her wings: and they shall be ashamed
because of their sacrifices.

15. From these premises grows a conclusion, which may go for a second part
of the Chapter, by way of Caveat to the tribe of Judah, not to communicate with
the Israelites in their sins, not so much as to enter into their borders, (as
Gilgal was their border town) for Idolatry sake, nor to run a whoring after
the Idol of Bethel, which in scorn he calls Bethauen the house and mansion
of iniquity, much less to blaspheme God, and to take his sacred name in vain,
swearing and binding themselves thereby into idolatry.

16. Of which Caveat there be two reasons rendered; the obstinate rebellion of
the Israelites, and Gods severe judgments ready to seize upon them; for even
as they are like untamed heyfers, so will God give them over as a sheep left
at large in the open pastures for every one to pray upon.

17. Wherefore their obstinacy in sinning is first set forth, in regard whereof,
he wishes Judah to have nothing to do with them: being Idolaters, rebellious,
(for so their bibbing 18.
of wine does make them) fornicators, bribers, to conclude, shameful
offenders: yea the Princes themselves, who for their place and dignity ought to
excel in virtue, and to be the glory and protection of Gods people, are of all
other the most infamous.

19. Then he sets forth the judgment, that the wind as in her wings will
bind them up and reserve them into punishment.

CHAP. 5. 6. 7.
1. Hear this, O ye Priests, and attend, O ye house of Israel and ye the
Kings house give ear, for to you pertains this judgment: because ye have
been a snare in Mizpah, and a net spread voon Tabor.

2. They that turning aside to make slaughter Deepen.
go into deep places: Iam a correction to them all.

CHAP. 5.
1. The second Sermon is in the 5. 6. and 7. Chapters, wherein being to declare
grievous crimes in both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and the punishments
of God upon them, he begins with an exordium to procure audience and
attention to that which he is to say, fetching arguments: first from their
person, who all; to wit, the Priests, both the hedge Priests of Jeroboam, and
the holy Priests of Leu^, the house of Israel, and the house of Judah, which
holding fast to David (the King set up of God) are called the Kings house, do
well deserve this sentence, being as guilty of capital crimes, as thieues and
robbers by the high way side.

2. Next, from the person of God to whom it belongs by his word and by his
rods, to chastise these robbers, that are like to those that lurking in the
caves and holes of the earth to murder poor souls.

3. I know Ephraim and Israel is not hid from me: that now O Ephraim, thou
playest the harlet, that Israel is defiled.

4. They Geut.
frame not their doings to turn unto their God; for the spirit of fornications
is in the midst of them, and Jehovah they know not.

5. Yea, the pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore shall Israel
and Ephraim tumble down in their iniquity, Judah also shall tumble with them.

6 Let them go with their flock, and with their heard to seek Jehovah, but
they shall not find him; he withdraws himself from them.

7. Against Jehovah they have dealt treacherously; for they have brought forth
strange children: now shall the month eat them up, their parts.

8. Blow ye the Cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: shout at Bethaven,
let Beuiamin behind thee shout.

9. Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: when among the Tribes of
Israel I shall make known the same to be certain.

10. The Princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: upon them will
I power out as waters, mine indignation.

3. After the Exordium, in the second place he lays down their crimes; in
body and soul rushing into all impiety.

4. Having no desire of reformation, nor to bring forth the fruits of true
repentance.

5. And therewithal the punishment for their pride and arrogancy, being so
great that it may serve for a thousand witnesses to convince their wickedness:
they shall therefore fall and be cut off, both sorts of them, the ten Tribes,
and Judah.

6. So certainly, that they shall not be able with any external service to
appease the wrath of God, nor to escape his hand and judgment.

7. And even as they make no bones to break their faith to God by spiritual
fornication, mingling, as it were, their seed with strange Gods and foreign
people: so it shall it come to them which happens to women worn with
adulteries, as Ezechiel speaks that their monthly diseases, procured by
inordinate lust eat up and consume their bodies.

8. These Judgments are garnished by a hypotiposis, or a lively pourtraiture
and representation thereof before their eyes: as if God did summon all the
parts of the Land to prepare themselves for an unhappy war. Gibeah the bounder
of Judah, Rama the bounder of Israel; Bethauen, in the Desert confining upon
both, but longing to Bethel and unto Israel to conclude the Tribe of Judah,
situate behind Benjamin.

9. For both Ephraim the flower of Israel, and all the Israelites, howsoever
now they scorn my words and hold them for fables, shall one day feel the
truth of them, being laid wast and desolate.

10. And upon the Princes of Judah, that pervert Church and common wealth, and
break the bounds of all laws divine and humane, will I power forth my
indignation in most plenteous and abundant manner.

11. Ephraim is oppressed and crushed in judgment: because he will, he goes
after the commandment.

12. Therefore was I as a moth unto Ephraim: and as rottenness to the house of
Judah.

13. But when Ephraim saw his disease and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim
unto Ashur, and Judah sent to a King that would protect: but he shall not be
able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of the sore.

14. For I will be as a fierce Lion to Ephraim, and as a young Lion to the
house of Judah: I, I will tear and go away, I will take up and none shall
rescue.

15. I will go return to my place, till they acknowledge the offense, and
seek my face: In affliction unto them.
when affliction is upon them, they will seek me early, saying.

CHAP. 6.
1. Come and let us return to Jehovah, for he has torn and he will heal
us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.

2. He will restore us to life within two days: the third day he will raise
us up, and we shall live in his sight.

3. And we Shall know, follow after.
shall know and proceed in the knowledge of Jehovah, as the morning whose going
forth is steady: and he shall come as the rain unto us, as the latter and
seasonable rain unto the earth.

4. What should I do to thee, O Ephraim? What should I do to thee, O Judah;
since your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew Morning at a man may
say.
dropping early, goes away.

5. Therefore hewed I by the Prophets, I slew them by the words of my mouth;
and thy judgments were as the light that breaks forth.

6. That I am delighted with kindness and not with sacrifice; and with the
knowledge of God more than with burnt offerings.

7. But they transgressed the covenant, as if it had been a man's: there dealt
they treacherously against me.

8. In Gilead they were every one, a City of workers of iniquity: Footstepped
(if I may so say) with blood.
with bloody footsteps.

9. And like to troops waiting for a man, are the society of Priests: they
murder after the manner as it was at Sechem; for they work abomination.

10. In the house of Israel do I see a horrible matter: There by the whoredom
of Ephaim, Israel is defiled.

11. Yea, O Judah, that Ephraim did put an harnest in thee: whilst I brought
back the captive multitude of my people.

CHAP. 7.
1. Whilst I heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim discovered, and the
Wickednesses.
exceeding wickedness of Samaria; for they work falsehood: and the thief
comes in, the troop rusheth forth.

2. Neither do they say To.
in their heart, that I remember all their wickedness: now their doings
compass them about, they are before my face.

3. With their wickedness they make glad the King; and with their lies the
Princes.

4. All of them are adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker; who leaves off
watchings after he has kneaded the dough until it be leauened.

5. In the day of our King, the Princes have made him sick, with heat caught
of wine: he has stretched out his hand with scorners.

6. For they have applied their heart to lying in wait, as an Oven: which,
whilst their baker sleeps all night long, in the morning burns as A fire
of a flame.
a flaming fire.

7. They all wax hot as the Oven, and eat up their Judges: all their Kings
fall, there is none among them that calls unto me.

11. In the third place follows a Narration of the offenses of both these
people, five in number, with judgments suitable thereunto.

First, will worship and Idolatry; in preferring the ordinances of men before
Gods institution: That albeit his Judgments lay heavy upon them, and crushed
them to pieces, yet they were not therewith dismayed, but with a full swing,
and with their whole heart went after the trash of men's inventions only,
because it liked them better, then follow Gods Commandments.

12. Secondly, when God by chastisements went about to reclaim them, wasting
them as a moth does a vesture, and as rottennes does the bones.

13. They, though seeing and knowing it full well, betook them not to God. But
the Israelites and Menachen their King, they become tributaries unto Asshur:
Achaz the King of Judah, he flies unto the same, as unto a Bulwark, though he
shall not be able to do them good.

14. Thirdly, neither Gods corrections nor his Word moving them to repentance,
can prevail to make them from their heart to seek unto him. Wherefore first
he speaks of correction, wherein God as a gracious and loving father,
thought that partly by carrying a hard hand upon them, renting and tearing them
in pieces.

15. Partly by withdrawing his gracious presence from them, keeping Court as it
were, at another place, they would confess themselves guilty, and at the least
in their affliction earnestly seek his face.

CHAP. 6.
1. Secondly, he prescribes a form of their conversion, what he would have
them to do, and how to stir up one another.

First, in acknowledging, by repentance, Gods just and righteous hand before
upon them.

Secondly, in apprehending through faith, the power of the same hand for their
healing and repair.

2. Grounding upon his kind and gracious nature, easieto be entreated, and
full of mercy and compassion to poor repentant sinners: He will heal, he
will quicken, he will raise up, we shall live for ever before him.

3. And grow in faith and knowledge, as the light of the morning that grows
more and more unto the steady day, Prou. 4. 18.

To conclude, he will abundantly bestow upon us all spiritual blessings.

4. But neither of these, his word nor chastisements, or whatsoever God might
do else, could fasten upon his people a sound and constant course of
godliness. If any good motions rose within them, they quickly vanished and
came to nothing.

5. The fourth sin is, that albeit God seeing their inconstancy and
fickleness in serving him, caused his Prophets, their teachers and
instructers, not only to slay and terrify them with the horror of his deadly
judgments, that so they might be kept from evil, which is the first use of
the Minister, but to hold forth the light and lantern of the word, that they
might know what they ought to do, and be brought to understand and perform
their duties, which is the second use of the Ministry.

6. A thing more pleasing unto God, than all sacrifices and oblations.

7. Yet they brake the bonds of covenant between God and them, as if they had
had to do but with a mortal man, yea (which mightily increases the quality
of their fault) where God so slew them, and shined unto them by his Prophets,
even there, in that place, they made no conscience of transgressing against
God, and falling to iniquity.

8. The whole land, even all the parts of it; for in Gilead (the Country beyond
Jordan) there was every City full of malefactors, bloody men, and murderers. A
man might trace them in their wickedness, through the very streets, for their
footsteppes were in blood.

9. The College of Priests was a society and fraternity of robbers that stand
by the high way side, they kill and slay after the manner as it was at Shechem,
impudently, shamelessly and audaciously, in barbarous and savage manner; a
foul abomination.

10. The people of Israel have horribly transgressed, and committed spiritual
fornication.

11. Yea Judah also has wrapped himself in the same offenses, and received
from themthe seed of Idolatry; when even them, says God, (which aggrauateth
the offense) when I graciously brought back my people from captivity oppressed
of Israel, and of Aram.

CHAP. 7.
1. Their fifth offense is a greediness in sinning provoking one another to all
kind of wickedness: Set forth.

1. By a peevish disposition of theirs, when God meant most to do them good.
Even as it fares with a sick patient, who the more careful the Physician is
to prescribe diet for recovery of his health, the more earnestly is he
carried to all kind of surfeiting and disorder, though it be the endangering
of his life.

Secondly, by a distribution of their offenses, for they abound both in fly
and in open sins, lying, theiuery, robbery.

2. Thirdly, they are so far from being abashed to think that God sees and
remembers all their iniquity, as contrarily they brag and boast of the
multitude of their sins, even as a man would do of a guard of men that do
attend him.

3. Fourthly, all degrees, the King himself and his nobles, and as the people
of the Land adulterate themselves.

4. Fifthly, all these run as greedily after sin, (that sin especially the
sin of adultery) as fire burns in a hot oven, when the Baker after he has
kneaded his dough, overtaken with sleep; forgets to make it cleave.

5. Sixthly, by the circumstance of time, even that very day, when at the Kings
Coronation, God is to be served and the Prince and people to be put in mind
of their duty, then they do most of all run riot. The Princes, who by their
gravity and wisdom should be the stays, and proppes of the common wealth,
have their hand deepest in this offense; not only themselves bibbers and
tossepots, but forcing one another to drink, till they fall into a surfeit.

The pint and quart, moderate and reasonable measures will not serve their
turn: but they must have whole flaggons full of wine and drink as we say by
the dozen. The King himself quaffes as well as they and joins hands with
beastly drunkards: so impudent in their wickedness, that they scorn both God
and man.

6. Well did I therefore, says the Prophet, resemble them to an oven; for they
are as hot as any furnace, and furious unto evil.

The King indeed, as the Baker does the oven, ought to make clean the common
wealth, and by his power and authority to cool the heat and fury of the
Princes.

But he sits still and lets all alone: that like the oven which burns
all night long unto the morning.

7. They set a fire with wine, conspire all of them against their King, his
ministers and servants, whereby they change their kings apace: for by their
conspiracies many perish in a short time; wickedly if you respect the
conspirators: but justly and righteously, if you look unto the Kings
themselves; for they are all wicked Kings: there is none of them that calls
upon God.

8. Ephraim, he mingleth himself among the people: Ephraim is as Cake not
turned.

9. Strangers devour his strength, and he knows not: yea, hoarinesse is
sprinkled upon him and he knows not.

10. And though the Pride of Israel testify to his face: yet they do not
return to Jehovah their God, nor seek him for all that.

11. But Ephraim is like a silly dove, without heart: to Egypt they call, to
Ashur they go.

8. The fourth and last part of this Prophecy has a summarie repetition of
the peoples sins and of Gods judgments in that regard.

Their sins, first, consociating with strangers and making a mixture of their
religion with the superstitions of the Gentiles. They neither hold them to the
sincerity of Gods service, not to the mere toys and fooleries of the heathen;
but frame to themselves a mingle mangle out of both. And therefore may well be
compared to a Cake half tosted, neither hot nor cold, being as we use to
speak neither fish nor flesh.

9. Secondly, an incredible blockishnesse, without common sense.

That albeit the evils they endure of their confederates and allies, bring gray
hears upon them, and make them old before their time, yet they not only not
consider it:

10. But (which is their third offense) they are so proud and insolent, that
for all this they turn away, and will not be brought to God, but had rather
join themselves to foreign nations, then to seek after him.

The fourth and last offense is their mad and foolish consorting with
strangers. So silly they are and without understanding to pray in aid of those
whose mind is only to spoil and eat them up.

12. When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them, and bring them down
as the foul of the heaven: I will chastise them, According to the hearing of
their congregation.
as their congregation has heard.

13. Woe unto them, for they have flitted from me, desolation unto them, for
they have transgressed against me: when I am to redeem them, then they speak
unto me with lies.

14. And do not cry unto me with their hearts, when they houle upon their
beds: when for corn and new wine they assemble and turn aside unto me.

15. But when I bind up and strengthen their arm; then do they imagine
mischief against me.

16. They return not to the most high, they are like a deceitful bow, their
Princes fall by the sword, coming from the rage of their tongue: this is their
derision in the land of Egypt.

12. The punishment is, that as the fouler takes the Dove, so God will ensnare
and catch these foolish ones, and lay upon them the scourges and corrections
threatened by his Prophets.

13. All because of their sins, especially their hypocrisy, which hypocrisy
of theirs is set forth by a dissimilitude, when they have need of me that I am
to do them good, and help them out of trouble, in their difficulties and
distresses, then they call upon me: but all is nothing else, but mere
dissimulation.

14. For they do it not from their hearts; what face soever they set upon it,
whether it be privately in the night or openly in the day, yet in those times
of their need, in famine and want, they make a pretense, as if they would come
toward me.

15. But when I, as a kind Physician, hold up their arm, and bring them case
and comfort, they go on in their wickedness.

16. Turn they do, but not unto God, it is falsely and deceitfully: But they
have their reward according.

The sword that serves to work their conspiracies, does slay and kill the
Princes. And this sword is whet on and sharpened by virulent tongues, setting
debate between them.

These murders so rife, and their common and daily plotting of stirs and
troubles in the state, make them a scorn even to their friends and allies.

CHAP. 8. 9. 10.
1. Set the Trumpet to the roof of thy mouth, and say, he he shall come as
an Eagle against the house of Jehovah: because they transgress my covenant,
and trespass against my Law.

2. The Israelites cry unto me: my God, we know thee.

3. Because Israel has cast of the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue
him.

CHAP. 8.
The third Sermon touching the Peoples sins, and Gods judgments for the
same, in the 8. 9. and 10. Chapters, has 5. parts.

The first part is a proposition of judgments against the people of Israel,
and the cause of those judgments. The judgments are first set forth by a
military Hypotiposis, or lively representation of the enemies coming against
them, as if it were now a doing: then they are amplified by circumstances on
the part of the enemy, and on the peoples part, of the enemy, that he shall
come swiftly and powerfully: on the peoples part; for that they are those which
were before, through grace of Gods household: the causes are three.

First, Their revolt and falling away from the Covenant between God and them,
and from the Law wherein that Covenant is written.

2. Secondly, Hypocrisy, calling upon God, and making profession of his name,
not in truth, but with a counterfeit piety.

3. Thirdly, the renouncing of all good.

4. They have set up a King, but not by me: they have made made Princes which I
know not: of their silver and their gold have they made them Eugges.
Idols, that Israel may be cut off.

5. Thy Calfe O Samaria shall cast them off, when mine anger is kindled against
them: how long will they not abide innocence.

6. For he also is from Israel, the workman made it, and it is no God; for the
Calfe of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

7. Seeing they have sown the wind, they shall reap the whirle-winde: it
has no stalk, the bud shall yield no meal, if perhaps it do yield,
strangers shall swoop it up.

8. Israel shall be swooped up, now shall they be among the Nations as a
vessel wherein is no pleasure.

9. Because these go up to the Assirian, a wild Ass only for himself: the
Ephraimites hire lovers.

10. Yea, because they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them
together: (for they have begun a little) because of the burden of the King of
Princes.

11. Because Ephraim has multiplied Altars to sin: Altars are unto him to
sin.

12. The things I prescribe unto him In the excellencies.
in the excellent documents of my Law, are counted as a strange thing.

13. The sacrifices of mine offerings, those that sacrifice flesh and eat,
Jehovah accepts not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their
sins, that they return to Egypt.

14. To conclude, Israel has forgotten his maker, and has built Temples, and
Judah multiplied fenced Cities: Therefore I will send down a fire upon the
Cities of him, after it has devoured the Palaces of the other.

4. The second part, is an Enarration or larger declaring of those judgments.
First, against their revolt being of two kinds, one from the temporal kingdom
of David, figuring the kingdom of Christ; wherein what Kings soever they set
up, whether you consider Jeroboam, or any of his successors, it was not from
God, he knew them not nor approved them, because it was not according to the
promise made to David, but by the peoples rebellion, or their own usurpation.
The other is from the spiritual worship, and service of God: and both these
reuolts, the latter especially, shall be unto their ruin.

5. For to speak of the latter, first, O Samaria that art the Kings chamber
and Metropolitan city, thy Calfe shall do thee no good: Nay, it shall hurt
thee exceedingly, and provoke my wrath against thee. Thou that can never
away to keep touch with God in the duties of spiritual wedlock.

6. The reason thereof is rendered in detestation of Idolatry.

First, from the cause, the nature and orginall of these Idol gods; men
invented them: so did Israel this as well as that other Calfe in the
wilderness, which brought so many heavy plagues upon Gods people.

The makers, are Smiths, Carpenters, and Artificers, a token it was not God.

The matter, is some course and base metal.

Secondly, from the lamentable and fearful destruction, not only of the
Idols themselves, which shall turn into dross and rubbish, but of the
Idolaters their worshippers.

7. Set forth by three similitudes; as they have sown, so shall they reap,
and a great deal worse too.

8. Secondly, they shall be swallowed up, their substance eaten out and
consumed.

Thirdly, they shall be as a vessel that none takes pleasure in, despised of
every one.

9. And touching the other kind of revolt, which we set in the first place,
the forsaking of the house of David, and relying upon foreign aid upon the
Assirian, that is, wholly for himself, and has no mind of helping others,
seeking it with bribes and rewards.

10. Well may they bribe and hire, but this will be the end: The Israelites
themselves shall fall by heaps, the nations whom they shall hire, shall come
so tumbling in upon them, as Esaias told Achaz, Esaias 8. Do you not see it is
prettily well begun already. Look upon the late example, that is yet now fresh
and bleeding before your eyes: so you will the better believe my threatening in
that which is to come, I mean the sacking and carrying away of the Tribes
beyond Jordan by Pull and Tiglath Pileser. If you ask me the reason, why God
should be so angry with you, it is because you are so foolish, or so wicked
rather, to send presents and tributes to the King of Asshur, (who in the pride
and vanity of his heart, names himself the King of Princes, the mighty and
most potent King) with the pilling, polling, and burdening of your subjects.

11. Secondly, he declares the judgments against hypocrisy. Their hypocrisy
such and so great, by multiplying al^a^s to sin against God, vainly and
sinfully through their hypocrisy, abusing his name.

12. That the excellent things which God prescribed in his Law, those outward
ceremonies of that sanctiue and holiness, he makes no more account of, then
if they were strange things, that he never heard of before.

13. The oblations and sacrifices he takes no pleasure in them.

But their punishment shall be, he will remember their iniquity and punish it
in his time upon those false persons that are faithful, neither to God, nor to
the King of Asshur, but go their wales to Egypt after covenant made with the
Assirians.

14. Thirdly, he declares the punishment against their renouncing of all good.
That it shall be as a fire to consume the cities of Judah, and the palaces of
Israel. For Judah was grieuouslie vexed by Senacherib, and Israel before that
wasted and carried away captive.

CHAP. 9.
1. Be not glad, O Israel unto rejoicing as other people that thou go a
whoring from thy God: love a harlots reward in all the corn floores.

2. The floor and the wine press shall not feed them: and the new wine shall
lie unto her.

3. They shall not dwell in the Land of Jehovah: but Ephraim shall return to
Egypt, and in Assyria eat that which is vncl^ane.

4. They shall not effer wine to Jehovah, neither shall those offerings be
sweet unto him their Sacrifices should be unto them as the Bread.
meat of mourners, all that eat thereof should pollute themselves: for their
meat, for their Their soul, as Leuit. 21. 1.
dead, comes not into the house of Jehovah.

5. What would ye do in the day of solemnity: and in the day of the feast of
Jehovah?

6. For lo, they shall perish by destruction, Egypt shall gather up, Memphis
shall bury them: the Tents of desire.
pleasant tents, for: heir silver, the nettle shall inherit, the thorn shall
be in their Tents.

CHAP. 9
1. The third part of the Prophecy is a contestation against the Israelites
over confident rejoicing and pleasing of themselves in their present good
estate, which makes them of the true worship and service of God: for,

First, these men who despise the Law of God and the just observations thereof
shall contrary to the Law ear in the Countries whether they shall be carried
captives, things impure and unclean, no way acceptable unto God, neither
consecrated by offering the first fruits thereof as holy unto him, nor any
other way.

4. Again, their sacrifices and oblations shall cease, it shall not be
permitted to them to offer drink offerings to the Lord: And it were as good
they did not: for their Sacrifices could not be pleasing to him; because, if
they did sacrifice, it could not be done according to the Law, which requires
mirth and cheerfulness before the Lord when men sacrifice: whereas these in
their captivity have no cause but of mourning and heaviness: for as the Law of
God shuts out meat offered for their dead ones, from coming into the
Temple by the same analogye and proportion, the sacrifice of those than mourn
are ungrateful ad not accepted of God.

5. Lastly, how can they celebrate the solemnities and feasts of the Lord,
which are to be done with cheerefulnes, and gladness?

6. The third judgment he foretells, is death and horrible desolation,
death even in those Countries, whither they did fly for refuge. The desolation
such as their pleasant tents and dwelling places, made to hide their treasures
in, shall be ouergrowne with nettles and thorns.

7. Come are the days of visitation, come are the days of recompense, let
Israel know: the Prophet is a fool, the man of wind is madd, for the
multitude of thine iniquity, the great privy hatred.

8. He watches Ephraim With my God
^^yned to my God: the Prophet is a snare of a fouler in all his ways, he
sets privy hatred in the house of his God.

9. They They deepen corrupt.
corrupt deeply as in the days of Gibeah; he will remember their iniquity, he
will visit their sins.

10. As grapes in the Wilderness found I Israel, as the first ripe fruit in
the figtree at her first time, did I see your fathers: they went to Baalpeor
and separated themselves to that shameful one, and the detestations were
according as they loved.

11. The glory of Ephraim shall flee away like a bird, from the birth and from
the womb, and from the conception.

12. But if they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them from a man.
will I bereave them that there shall not a man be left: yea even woe to them,
when I depart from them.

13. Ephraim as as I see Tyrus, is planted in pleasant habitation: but Ephraim
shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

14. Give to them, O Jehovah, what thou should give: give them a miscarrying
womb and dry breasts.

15. All their wickedness in Gilgal; for there did I hate them for the
wickedness of their doings: out of my house will I expel them: I will love
them no more, all their Princes are unruly.

16. Ephraim shall be smitten, their root shall dry up, they shall not bring
forth fruits; yea though they beget children, yet will I slay the The desires.
dearest of their womb.

17. My God will reject them because they hearkened not to him: therefore shall
they be wandering among the nations.

CHAP. 10.
1. Israel is an empty Uine, he brings forth fruit for himself; according
to the multitude of his fruit, he multiplyeth altars according to the goodness
of his Land, they make goodly statues.

2. Their heart divides, now are they faulty: he shall Behead.
break down their altars, he shall waste their statues.

3. For now they say, we have no King: for we fear not Jehovah, and what
should the King do to us.

4. They have spoken words, cursing In vanity.
falsely in making a covenant: And judgment springs up as hemlocke in the
furrows of my field.

5. Because of the Calfe of Bethauen, shall the inhabitants of Samaria, every
one be afraid: when his people shall mourn for it, yea and his black ones who
rejoice of it, because of the glory thereof, for it is departed from it.

6. He also shall be brought to Ashur, a present to the King that will
protect: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall blush because of his
own counsel.

7. Samaria's own King shall be cut off like the foame Upon the face of the
waters.
upon the water.

8. The high places also of Auen, the sin of Israel shall be hewn down:
the thorn and the thistle shall come up upon their Altars, and they shall say
to the mountains, cover us, and to the hills, fall upon us.

The fourth part of the Prophecy is a confirmation of denounced indgements, as
certain as if it were now come; that they may know and learn by miserable
experience, how their false Prophets did seduce them, uttering nothing but
vanitic and wind, and the froth of their own imagination, to sooth up the
people, and nourish them in evil. The confirmation therefore is from two
causes. One their sacrilegious disposition and wickedness toward God. The
other, their civil discords, and home divisions, to the ruin of the
Commonwealth, whereby many Kings rose up in a short time.

8. When I speak of civil discord, I mean not only that the Princes and
people are interessed in this business, but the Prophets themselves, which are
set of God as watchmen to ouersee the people, and keep them at one. They watch
indeed, but far in another sort, for they watch treacherously, and perfidiously
to betray the people, to set them at jar: even the godly among them, those
that cleave and hold fast unto my God.

The divisions and heart burnings of the people do they take advantage of, to
set them together by the ears: so that this discord even in the house of God,
the Prophet in all his courses uses as a fowlers grinne or snare to catch the
poor souls, and to entrap them.

9. But both these things, a sacrilegious disposition and civil discords, are
hereditarie evils to the house of Israel. And as they corrupt themselves this
way, and throw one another into the depth of all iniquity, sinning openly and
shamelesly, like to that their Fathers did at Gibeah; so shall they be punished
as their fathers were.

10 For, touching their sacrilegious disposition; compare first, what their
fathers did to Baal peor in the wilderness, where I took as great pleasure in
them, and they were as dear and precious unto me, as grapes, and as the first
ripe figs; but they forsook me, and joined themselves to that shameful Idol:
and as the sway and heat of their spiritual lust did lead them, as they loved
and liked, so did they multiply Idol after their pleasure.

11. As Ephraim therefore treads this way in his forefathers steps, so shall
he be partaker of their plagues. The sons which are the pride and glory of
their parents, I will make quick riddance of, three manner of ways; for
either they shall not quicken in the womb, or not go out there their full
time or dye as soon as they are borne.

12. And if happily they escape all these, and have some bringing up in their
childehood, yet it in all be all one, not one of them shall remain alive.

13. Let them in their own concei^ be never so strong and sure, as fast
rooted, and as well planted as Tyrus that famous City: yet this that I have
said shall surely come to pass. All their children, young and old, shall
certainly be destroyed.

14. O God therefore, says the Prophet, diuerting his speech to him, since
thou have threatened two evils, one that their glory shall flit away as soon as
they be borne or conceived in the womb: the other, that fathers shall lose
their children when they have brought them up: be satisfied with that which is
the less evil of the twain; either that there may never any be borne, or
being borne, may for lack of sustenance dye out of hand.

15. But I stay not here, I will remember you of another like example of their
fathers at Gilgall. There were they wallowing in their wickedness the
uncircumcision of their flesh made me hate them. And albeit I in my mercy and
kindness pardoned their offense, and renewed my Covenant with them, cutting
off their foreskin; yet the place which I so sanctified, these men profane
again, that all the wickedness of their forefathers there does yet stick
unto them. They are rebels every one, all the Princes of them; wherefore I will
spread my judgments upon them.

First, I will expel them out of my house, and take from them my service and
religion, which they despise.

16. Secondly, they shall not prosper; but either be as a tree smitt with the
worms or weather, that they shall not bring forth the fruit of the womb; or
if they do, I will command the sword to slay their sweet and delightful
children.

Thirdly, they shall be led captive into strange Countries.

CHAP. 10.
1. Come to their civil discords: They are good to none but to themselves. If
they bring forth any fruit, they abuse it to their own lusts.

2. Whatsoever they have, they attribute it to their idols, but God jealous of
his glory, will cut off their idols and places consecrate to Idolatry by the
top.

3. They think, the King should not rule them, but they the King. And because
they have cast off all reverence of God, therefore they cast off and set light
by the King, which is his Ordinance.

4. They are all perjured, and falsifiers of their word and Covenant. New
Conspiracies spring every day among them; all is out of order, not judgment it
self, which ought to be holy unto God, scapeth free, but is turned into
bitterness and oppression.

A great indignity, that those which live of the furrows of my field, and whom
my bounty and largess does sustain, should make gall and wormwood to grow
up in stead of good and sauourie fruit.

5. But the punishment of their Idolatries (the Calves of Bethel and Dan) shall
be.

First, fear and trembling.

Secondly, loss of all their glory, and whatsoever they rejoice in.

6. Thirdly, captivity of the inhabitants, that shall make them ashamed of
their doings.

7. Fourthly, destruction of the King of Israel, he that is now so glorious,
shall then be no more set by, than the foame that is upon the water.

8. Fifthly, Ruin of their Idols, and idolatrous places wherein the Israelites
sinned so grieuouslie.

6. The sense and terror of Gods judgments driving them to desperation.

9. From the days of Gibe ah have thou sinned, O Israel, there they stood; the
battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not reach them.

10. It is in my desire that I bind them; for the people shall be gathered
against them, binding them to be carried away in their two habitations.

11. For Ephraim is an heyfer taught, that loves to tread out the corn:
Though I would have passed upon the be awty of her neck, would have made
Ephraim to ride, Judah should have ploughed, and Jacob should have Harrowed to
him.
harrowed.

12. Sow to your selves to righteousness, (said I) reap unto kindness,
swallow up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come
and power down the rain of righteousness upon you.

13. You have plowed wickedness, you reap iniquity, you cat the fruit of
lying, because thou trust est in thine own way, in the multitude of thy strong
ones.

14. Therefore shall a tumult rise among thy people, and thy fenced places
shall every one be wasted, as Shalman wasted House of Arbel.
the country of Arbell in the day of battle, the mother with the children
shall be dashed in pieces.

15. Thus shall Bethell do unto you, because of The wickedness of your
wickedness.
your exceeding wickedness: in the very morning In cutting off, cut off.
utterly cut off shall be the King of Israel.

9. The fifth and last part follows, which is the conclusion of the Prophecy:
repeating first that which was said before, of the peoples sinning, like their
fathers of Gibeah, nothing moved with Gods merciful and gracious dealing, who
cut them not off in that war against the wicked Beniaminites, as they did
deserve, but suffered them to remain.

10. But because they will not learn to profit by Gods mercies, Let me see
whother they will profit by my Chastisements. I think best to correct them and
to deliver them bound in both their habitations of Israel and of Judah to be
carried away Captives.

11. Next he does garnish and adorn this conclusion by a double dissimilitude.

One is of the Israelites affection and disposition compared with Gods gracious
counsel toward them.

Ephraim, says the Lord by the Prophet, was taught true Piety and instructed
in the fear of God; my purpose was to have tuned him that he might be pliable
to the yoke, and draw in my plough, and to occupy him in my service. But he
loves to take his ease, and only follows after his pleasure and profit.

12. The other by comparing Gods documents and instructions, calling them to
righteousness and holiness, that has most large and ample promises annexed
it.

13. With their contrary deeds insatiable in iniquity.

14. Lastly, he denounces the Judgment it self, a cruel and mortal war,
destroying them.

Amplifying this destruction: First by the greatness, set forth by a
similitude. That all sexes and ages shall be destroyed, even as Shalman
(Shalmanasar, by all likelihood in that voyage which is spoken of 2. Kin. 18.
34. and 19. 13.) wasted and destroyed the country of Arbel, afterward
renowned for the overthrow that Alexander the great gave in that place unto
Darius.

15. Secondly, by the causes that brought this Judgment upon them. They may
thank their idolatry for it.

Thirdly, by the speediness of the Judgment. Early, that is to say, quickly,
and anon it shall be done.

4. By the certainty, which the doubling of the word imports.

CHAP. 11.
1. Because Israel is a youth whom I love, therefore out of Egypt have I
called my son.

1. These are the three Sermons touching the sins of the people, and Gods
judgments against them for the same. Now in two Sermon^ more he sets forth
the promises of grace, peace and reconciliation to a small remnant, the little
handful of Gods elect, which in this 11. Chapter, being the first Sermon, he
does four manner of ways.

First, is the fundamental cause and ground work of all the good things,
which God offers or bestows upon the Jews; which is the grace and favor
of God in and through Christ. In whom because God loved them and adopted them
for his Children, therefore in his infinite mercy he brought his son for
their sake out of Egypt, where their sins deserved, he should perpetually
remain, and never to have come back for the work of their redemption.

So this place is applied and expounded. Math. 2.

2. As they called to them, so went they from their presence, they sacrificed
unto Baalim, and burnt incense to their graven Images.

3. When as I acquaint Ephraim, he takes them in his arms: and they know not
that I heal them.

4. With cords of a man do I draw them, with thick bands of love, and I am
unto them as those that lift up the yoke put upon their cheeks: that I might
reach meat unto them.

5. He was not to have returned into the Land of Egypt, or of the Assyrian who
is his King: but they refused to convert.

6. To conclude, when the sword abides in his cities and consumes his members
and denoureth: because of their own counsels.

7. My people are prone to rebellion against me: although they called them to
the most high, he does not withal exalt him.

2. The second thing, is the peoples extreme ingratitude 1. Posit. Refusing
Christ.
refusing Christ: but that is incled by mentioning the sins of the time, he
lived in; Idolatry especially and the worship of false gods, and is further
amplified by comparing Gods gracious dealing in this behalf, and the holy
means, which he used to reclaim them.

First, he called them by the Prophets.

3. Secondly he taught and informed the people how he would be served, yet
they set up Idols in his stead, and after the manner of impudent and
shameless strumpets, took the puppets in their arms, and embraced them
before his face.

4. Thirdly, he heaped upon them many favors and tokens of his Jove; howbeit
all Gods benefits could not keep them to him, but they would needs fly unto
strangers for help.

He drew them not as beasts, but gently and lovingly with the words of men.
Like a good husbandman, he lift up the yoke from their neck, to give them
meat.

5. So as they wanted nothing: there was no cause for them to run for help,
either to the Egyptian, as Hoshea did, or to the Assirian, to whom they were
tributaries from the time of Menachem, yet they would not be stayed.

6. Thirdly, he laid upon them heavy crosses and corrections.

The sword lodged in their houses, it eat up and consumed their very bodies,
because of their wickedness.

7. Yet they, prone unto rebellion, took no heed, nor gave glory unto God,
though all these things (the Word, Gods blessings and afflictions) invited them
unto him.

8. How should I expose thee, O Ephraim? how should I deliver thee up, O
Israel? how should I dispose thee as Admah? how should I set thee as Zeboim?
Mine heart turns it self within me, together do My repentance.
my bowels of repentance boil.

9. I will not execute the heat of my wrath, I will Not return to destroy.
no more destroy Ephraim: for I am God Almighty, and not a man, the holy ox in
the midst of thee, and I will not invade the city.

8. The third thing is the desolation of this people, which 4. Posit.
Desolation.
well might have been a gulf to swallow them up, and a grave to bury them in
for ever, being most worthy to perish, as the Cities which God destroyed in his
wrath, Genesis 19. Howbeit, God in the bowels of his mercy, earning and taking
pity of them, spares to lay upon them the extremity of his wrath, and is
ready to save them for his mercies sake.

This latter has the proofs and reasons rendered for it, which are three; all
taken from the consideration of the nature of God.

First, his mercies, as we said before.

9. Secondly, his unchangeableness, being not a man that is always variable,
and differing as well from himself as others, but the mighty God, whose
purpose and decrees are constant for the saving of the elect.

Thirdly, his holiness, who is himself holy, and the author of eternal
sanctity.

10. After Jehovah shall they go as a roaring Lion: for he shall roar, and
the children shall Tremble: So in the next verse.
come trembling from the Sea.

11. They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of
Asshur: and I will place them in their houses, the speech of Jehovah.

10. In the fourth and last place come the promises themselves; that he will
bring them to the knowledge and 5. Posit. Call.
participation of Christ, from whose presence before they are said to fly
away. A Prophecy of the conversion and calling of the Jews, to be
accomplished in the last days.

It is amplified.

First, by the isntrumental cause, the preaching of the Gospel; which is the
voice of Christ, shaking both heaven and earth.

Secondly, by the great assemblies that out of all nations, 44. Posit. All
nations embracing Christ.
languages, and people shall join and have their part in so great a benefit:
wherefore he reckons up;

First, the Sea, that is, the furthest and most remote parts of the earth, as
Zachary in express term; has it, Zach. 10. 11. whereby are specially meant
our western Churches, but withal, the northern parts.

11. Secondly, Egypt, noting the whole South. (...)

Thirdly, Asshur, or all the East crack; those (...)d mighty Kingdome^ that
lie Eastward from Judea, (...) to the Sun rising. Read Esaias 19. 23. 24. 25.
and Esaias 27. 12. 13. and Zach. 10. 11 12. 13. and Micah 7. 11. 12. which
prophecies do wonderfully concur with this, and are a key to open the
meaning of it.

So he does foretell that general spreading of the Gospel, and gathering of
the Elect far and wide, from one end of the heavens unto another, which
immediately follows the calling of the Jews, Math. 24. 31. for howsoever the
words in show seem only to import the collection of the Jews, dispersed into
these Countries, yet the comparing of that which went before, Chap. 1. 11.
makes me incline to a more general sense, and to understand it of the full
coming in of the Gentiles.

4. It is amplified by the effects common to them all, Joy, comfort, and peace
of conscience to men terrified with the sight and burden of their sins.

5. The phrases here do intimate a return with much 12. Posit. Repair
toward their Country.
difficulty, in the midst of many dangers, millions of fears, terrors, and
perplexities, into their own country.

6. The seating of them in their land again. 16. Posit. Sore distress.
23. Posit. Dwell in their Country.


VERSE 12. of Chapter 11. and Chapters 12. 13. 14.
12. Ephraim compassed me about with a lie, and the house of Israel with
deceit: when Judah yet ruled with God-almightie, and was faithful with the
holy ones.

CHAP. 12.
1. Ephraim feeding upon the wind, and following after the East wind, all the
day long multiplieth lying, and destruction: for they make a covenant with
Asshur, and oil is carried unto Egypt.

2. Jehovah also has a controversy with Judah: and being to visit Jacob
according to his ways, will render unto him according to his doings.

3. In the very womb, he took his brother by the heel: afterward in his
strength he played the Prince with God.

4. He played I say the Prince with the Angel, and prevailed, he wept and
humbly be sought him: At Bethel he found him, and there he spoke with us.

5. But Jehovah, God of hosts: Jehovah is his memorial.

6. Thou therefore turn unto thy God: observe kindness, and judgment, and
wait upon thy God continually.

12. The next Sermon, from hence to the end of the book contains the sins
of the Israelites, that is, of the ten Tribes, and an inuiting of them to
repentance, which is the end, and the scope, whereunto the former drives. Both
first propounded, and then amplified and enlarged.

Their sins are three.

1. The renting off themselves from the kingdom of Judah, and the forsaking of
true Religion: for though they would seem to worship God, yet it was but a
false, and a lying worship. And this is aggrauated, because they did thus
degenerate, even then when Judah, like a Prince of God, held fast his first
integrity, and kept the faith to God, those holy ones, the Father, Son, and
blessed Spirit.

2. The consociating of themselves to strangers, making Chapter 12.
a covenant with one, bringing presents to another, not 1.
only in vain, but to their own hurt.

3. The drawing of Judah to the like offenses: which brought Gods indignation
upon them. 2.


To repentance they are invited by setting before them the example of their
father Jacob. He left no means unattempted 3.
that he might obtain the blessing: he strove for it with his brother in the
womb, and afterward with the Angel.

4. Against whom with much wrestling he prevailed. And when the Angel loosing
the hollow of his thigh, wherein he showed his power, had reproved Jacob for
asking after his name, an argument of his Majesty: as being not simply an
Angel, but Christ, Jehovah the Angel of the covenant: Jacob with tears
besought the blessing, which he there graciously bestowed, and afterward at
Bethel confirmed unto him.

5. Even that Jehovah, whose promises are eternal, and who will perform them
to his Childrens Children, to the thousand generation, if they return unto him.

7. He is a merchant, in his hands are balances of deceit, he loves to
oppress.

8. And Ephraim says, yet I am become rich: I have got me wealth: All my
labors suffice me not, it is iniquity whatsoever is a fault.

9. But I am Jehovah thy God, even from the land of Egypt: yet should I make
thee to dwell in these Tents, as in the days of solemnity?

10. And speaking by these Prophets, should I multiply vision? and by the hand
of these Prophets, should I propound similitudes?

11. Is there iniquity in Gilead? are they only vanity in Gilgall? They
sacrifice bullockes: even these meant altars are as heaps in the furrows of my
field.

12. Thither fled Jacob out of the country of Aram: after Israel had served
for a wife, and for a wife had kept sheep.

13. Hither also by a Prophet did Jehovah bring up Israel out of Egypt: after
he was preserved by a Prophet.

14. Ephraim has provoked God With bitternesses.

his blood will his Lord leave upon him, and his reproach render to him.

but so soon as he offended with Baal, he died.

4. But I am Jehovah thy God, even from the land of Egypt: and God save me,

5. I did know thee in the wilderness: in the land Of droughts
of exceeding drought.

6. As their pastures were, they were filled, as soon as they were filled,

8. I met them as a Bear robbed of her whelps, and I brake the Shutting.
fall of their heart: and I devoured them there as a huge Lion, as a beast of
the field tearing them.

7. These things propounded, now he does amplify and enlarge each part: and
first the sins of the Israelites: covetousness, Idolatry, Pride. First
extreme covetousness, in fraud and oppression.

8. Rejecting all honest means of coming by their wealth, and scorning
whatsoever iumped not with their wicked desires.

9. Albeit God from the beginning had heaped blessings manifoldly upon them;
which they ought to have rested in, and not to fly unto unlawful means.

10. Yea, not so only, but had made ample and large promises of further
favors by his Prophets.

Both which do add to the unworthiness of their sin.

11. Their second sin is Idolatry, wherein more thoroughly to convince their
benumbed consciences, the Prophet reasons with them in this sort: What?
think you the men of Gilead, those beyond the river of Jordan, whom Tiglath
Pileser spoiled, and led captives, that they only were guilty of Idolatry:
and you not because you remain at home untouched of the Assyrian? Nay, says
he, the very entrance into the country, Gilgall it self, so abounds with
Idolatry, that it is not to be doubted, but in the rest of the parts of the
kingdom, their altars are as thick as furrows in the field, that is to say,
innumerable.

12. A horrible thing if it be well considered, that these two places should
now become the nurceries of evil, which heretofore were the means of so great
comfort to Gods people.

For Gilead served as a sanctuary unto Jacob, when he fled from Laban.

13. In Gilgall, God by Joshua renewed his covenant with your Fathers, after he
had brought them out of Egypt, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

14. But notwithstanding all that, Israel has so sinned as has been said,
and provoked Gods heavy indignation: and therefore his blood be upon him, he
shall remain guilty and subject unto punishment, and must be content to take
that, that comes of it.

CHAP. 13.
1. For this sin of Idolatry has brought three fearful judgments upon
them.

First, They that before were a terror unto all, are now of no reckoning.

The time indeed was, that if Ephraim did but speak, all the tribes trembled
and quaked.

But as soon as he offended with Baal, following after Idolatry; he was no
more set by, then a dead carcass.

2. Secondly, God in his judgment has given them up into hardness of mind,
and to their hearts Just: that for all this sudden change they repent not,
but run more and more into Idolatry.

3. Thirdly, Being made very fools, at the length, they shall vanish and come
to nothing.

4. Thus by the place, and by the effects, he has made odious their Idolatry.

Now lastly, he does the same by comparing on the contrary part, his covenant
with them from the beginning, and his former benefits, even in the wilderness.

5. Both which ought to have been motives to keep them fast unto him.

6. The third sin is their pride, and loftiness of heart, which made them to
forget God; and that in the midst of his blessings, when they had most cause
to remember him. A thing that Moses warned them of before, Deuteronomy. 8.

7. 8. But they went not so away with it. I met with them, says God, and
handled them roughly, as they did deserve.

9. He has marred thee, O Israel, when as in me, in thine help, thou
might have stood.

10. Where is thy King, Where now? that he may save thee in all thy cities? and
thy Judges, of whom thou saidest, give me a King and Princes:

11. I give thee a King in mine anger, and take away in my wrath.

12. The iniquity of Epbraim is bound up, his ^^nne is laid up.

13. The sorrows of a woman in travel shall come upon him: he is no wise
son, for then he would not stay A time.
a what in the Breach of Children.
mouth of the matrixe.

9. And so having done with the sins of the Israelites, he does now amplify,
and enlarge his former inuitation unto repentance: First taking arguments from
the good that thereby shall come unto them, compared with the evils that before
they were in, for their offenses. He says, God by his Prophet, meaning the
King of whom he speaks in the next verse, in whom thou puttedst thy trust.
Was the cause of thy Confusion. Whereas in me who am thy strength, and saving
health, all good things are to be found, and by repentance shall come unto
thee.

10. The former part is proved, for that none of their Kings and Princes were
able to do them good.

11. For God in his wrath set them up, and pulled them down: and in a little
while made many changes and alterations in the kingdom.

12. Their iniquity, which God tied up, as a man does his purse full of money,
and kept in store, to pay them home for it, was the cause of all this.

13. Yet were they so foolish, that though throws came upon them, as upon a
woman with Child, (for so is their Commonwealth compared to a mother, Chapter
23.). yet they had no list to rid themselves out of those dangers, and to put
forth into the hands of God, as unto a Midwife.

And this may well seem to be a prophecy of the great 4. Posit. Desolation.
misery they are now in, because of the promises which do follow.

14. From the power of the grave will I redeem them, from death I will avenge
them, where are thy plagues O death? where thy destroying O grave, repentance
shall be hidden from mine eyes.

15. For he shall bring forth fruit among the brethren: after that an East
wind coming; a wind of Jehovah coming up from the desert, his spring shall
become dry, and his fountain shall dry up, the same shall spoil the
treasure of all Vessels of desire.
pleasant vessels.

16. After that Samaria shall be laid desolate, for that she has rebelled
against her God: After that by the sword they shall fall, their infants be
dashed in pieces, and their women with child ripped.

14. In the second part, from the panges and sorrows before mentioned, he
passes presently to most sweet and comfortable promises. Being of four kinds.

The first promise is. The delivery of them out of that depth of misery,
wherein they were plunged, and making them to flourish again: which is first
set out by a double similitude.

One, comparing their wretched estate to death, and the 7. Posit. General Call.
grave. Out of the which he will set them free, by raising them from death to
life. For such and so wonderful shall their restoring be, that it is called
life from the dead. Rom, 11. 15.

And this resurrection (as it were) of their is an evident argument of the
general rising from the dead, Ezech. 37.

To which purpose the Apostle aptly, and properly does allege it. 1. Cor. 15.

15. The other similitude is from a piece of ground, all 30. Posit. Flourishing
Commonwealth.
dried up and parched, that nothing is able to grow notably, expressing the
miserable and distressed estate wherein this people has lien now very near
1600. years together. That as an Easterly wind, and atempestuous storm has
dried them quite: and spoiled all their delightful treasures: made them the
vilest and most contemptible of the earth, notwithstanding which he says:
Ephraim (that is, even the ten Tribes) shall flourish again, and hold up 8.
Posit. Ten Tribes.
their head among their brethren.

16. After these similitudes he lays the same forth without allegory, in
plain and express terms.

CHAP. 14.
1. Return O Israel, even to Jehovah thy God: for thou have fallen by thine
iniquity.

2. Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah: Say unto him, forgive all
iniquity, and Take. That is, taking, bestow as Exodus 25. 2.
bestow good, and we will render Calves with our lips.

3. Asshur shall not save us, upon horse we will not ride; neither will we say
any more, O our God to the work of our hands: for in thee the fatherless
finds mercy.

1. The second promise, is a promise of their repentance, Chapter 14.
and turning unto God, whereunto exhorting them, it 5. Posit. Call.
must be taken as a Prophecy, what God will be pleased at the last, to work
in their heart, see Esaias 31. 6. 7. Wherefore he propounds, the form of true
repentance; In the person to whom they shall turn.

2. In the parts of repentance: which are confession of sins, and promise of
amendment.

3. And lastly, in the motive to repentance, Gods nature ready to show mercy
to poor distressed sinners.

4. I will heal their turning away, loving them freely: when mine anger shall
turn from him.

4. The third promise, is forgiveness of sins, peace, 35. Posit. Covenant.
reconciliation, and Gods gracious acceptance of them in his Son, coming
from his own free love and favor, which are the fruits and joyful effects
of their repentance.

5. I will be as the dew unto Israel, he shall blossom as the Lilly: and
Strike.

6. His tender boughs shall Go.

smell like Lebanon.

7. Men shall return, dwelling under his shadow, they shall bring into life as
the corn, and blossom as the Vine: his memorial shall be sauourie, as the
wine of Lebanon.

8. Ephraim shall say, what have I any more to do with Idols: I will hear
and look upon him: I am like a green Firr^ tree, by me is thy fruit Is found.
at hand.

The fourth promise is of a glorious Church, which shall be set up among them:
consisting in the points that follow;

1. A most flourishing and happy estate, through the 39. Posit. Prosperity.
sweet and heavenly showers of all spiritual, and temporal benedictions,
which God from heaven will water them withal. Whereby, first they shall root,
and fasten downwards, gather such a head as no strength nor power, not hell
gate, shall be able to prevail against them.

6. Then shall they grow and spread vpwardes, be fair, fresh, and flourishing;
Not only so, but their happiness, shall be constant and perpetual, like to
the Olive tree, whose leaves are always green.

Lastly, this shall make them gracious and acceptable, both with God and men.

7. Secondly, Other people ravished with the sight of 44. Posit. All nations
embracing Christ.
such perfections, shall count themselves happy to dwell in their Tents, and
as it were, under the shadow of those boughs. The Nations of such as are to
be saved shall walk in her light, and the Kings of the earth shall bring
their glory and honor in unto her. Reu. 21. 24.

3. The Church by this means shall be increased, grow, and multiply as ears
of corn, or clusters in the Vine; 38 Posit. Multitude of believers.
for by bringing into life, or making to live, is meant the spiritual
propagation of Gods people, by the seed of the word, and power of Gods spirit.

4. The Nations shall honor them, and have them in 45. Posit. Nations honoring
them.
admiration. Far and wide shall their fame be spread, and their name be most

Thus does he comfort and arm their souls against those tempests, that

all corruption in Gods service, which is here noted by Idolatry, and the
worship of false gods. They shall have no more to do with Idols, or any
worship which is not offered in the name of his only son. Which God so
graciously will accept, that his ears shall be open, and his eyes always bent
only upon those that leaving false services and religions, betake themselves
to him in Christ, whom he will also recompense with abundance of heavenly
blessings, the fruits of holiness and righteousness 36. Posit. Spiritual

wrought in them by the Spirit of Christ, which is the sixth and last point.

But least Israel should take glory to himself, he tells them that the
praise of so great things, both of their turning, and of this their fructifying
is to be ascribed to God alone, without whom they can do nothing.

9. Who so is wise, let him understand these things, prudent, let him also
acknowledge them: for right are the ways of Jehovah, and the righteous shall
walk in them, but fallers away, let them stumble at them.

9. The last verse has a conclusion of this whole Prophecy, by an Epiphonema,
or elegant acclamation. Wherein the Prophet does stir up and exhort the
righteous to learn true wisdom and understanding for three reasons.

1. For that it is a ready passage, the tract, and high way to happiness and
glory.

2. These ways are all of them straight and right, full of equity and
holiness.

3. The righteous shall prosperously walk in them, to the saving of their
souls.

Contrariwise, he leaves the wicked, that fall away and go back from the
holy doctrine taught unto them, to the righteous Judgment of God, as the
Apostle does. Reu. 22. 11.

TO ALL THE SEED OF JACOB, FAR AND WIDE DISpersed. Peace and Truth be
multiplied unto you.
DAughter of Tsion by fleshly generation: Jerusalem which stickest close to
carnal rites and ordinances, and to the legal worship: To you I bring this
present, where ever you be dispersed. A spark out of a Diamond; one drop out
of that Sea, which the whole Ocean cannot hold. Flowing from the infinitenes
of wisdom revealed in the Scriptures. Concerning thy repair, and the
renewing of thee into a glorious and excellent estate: purchased for thee by
Immanuel thy Messiah; If so be of Jerusalem according to the flesh, thou may
be persuaded to become a member of the new Jerusalem, which is from above, the
mother of true believers. For thee has God honored above all the people of
the world, and given the praerogatiue first and last of all his holy promises.
Only unto those out of whose loins thou do come, was the promise of that
seed in whom all the families of the earth should be blessed. To thee alone
were committed the Oracles of God, for some thousand years together. So as
light shone in thy dwelling, when darkness covered the whole face of the earth
beside. Of thee were the Fathers, and they from whom Christ came as touching
the flesh, who is God over all, blessed for ever, Amen. By the ministry also
of those whom he did send, the Law came out of Tsion, and the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem to all the ends of the earth. So great was the worth of thy
Nation.

But him the Prince of life have thou slain, and nailed upon the Cross,
delivered into thy hands by the foreknowledge and determinate counsel of God.
Whom God raised up, loosing the sorrows of death, because it was impossible he
should be maistred of it; for this thine offense, and to make a way for the
calling of us Gentiles; wrath is come upon thee now sixteen generations. No
sorrow like to the sorrow that all this while has befallen thee. No people so
dispersed, without government, without Religion, without form, either of
Church or Commonwealth. No nation so contemptible and abhorred in the sight of
God and Men. And that worthily; for in thee is found a sin of all that ever
were in the world the shamefullest. To murder him that created thee, that by
his word and works did magnify thee, and make thee so famous, that came in
his own person to save thee: the Lord himself from Heaven.

But the days of this thy sinfulness, God winking at, does now every where,
and by all means inuit thee to repentance. Out of all the places of thy
dispersion, East, West, North, and South, his purpose is to bring thee home
again, and to marry thee to himself by faith for evermore. In stead that thou
wast desolate and forsaken, and fattest as a widow, thou shall flourish as in
the days of thy youth. Nay, above and beyond thy youth. To be the joy of the
earth, the most noble Church that ever eye did see. Small were thy beginnings
how great soever, so exceedingly shall thy latter end increase. Thy Savior
will ereit be long, draw near unto thee: not as once he did, riding upon an
Ass, base, and in humility, but as the glorius king of Tsion, subduing al
things to himself by the scepter of his word. Breaking thy hard heart,
fallowing up the fallowes of thy soul, he will set up all his glory in the
midst of thee, and make thee the wonder of the world. Out of thee shall come
gems and precious stones, richer then the Sapphire, ruddier then the Carbuncle,
shining above the Topaze. Ezraes, Nebemies, Mordecaes, builders of a better
Temple then that which thou have doated upon so long. Then shall thou mourn, as
the mourning for ones only begottten son: and all thy Tribes, with sorrow
and true repentance, shall look upon him whom they have thrust through. Thy
gates shall be made of pearls, and thy streets of pure gold. All the Kings of
the Gentiles shall bring their glory into thy city, and fall down before
thee. The light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of
the Sun, seven fold as the light of seven days. Thy Sun shall not set by
day, nor thy Moon by night. Blessed shall they be that bless thee, and cursed
shall they be that curse thee. When the Lord shall raise thy dead carkases by
the ministry of the Gospel, and say, Awake ye that have slept so long in the
dust of the earth.

And because God will do these great things for thee, do thou prepare thy self
to meet thy God. Words fail me for to set an edge, and to put some spiritual
life into thee. But my heart shall never fail to pray for thy prosperity all my
days. Bowing my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the God of
glory, that he would hasten that which he has spoken concerning thee by the
Prophets of old, and by the Apostles sent by his son. Whose counsels are
without repentance, his love never changes: he will not forget his promises to
thy Fathers: but will graft thee in by faith into that natural Olive tree,
from the which, thorough infidelity thou art hitherto broken off. The root is
holy and so it shall be manifest that thou (the branches) art, when Gog and
Magog falling before thee (which days are even now at hand) thou shall sit as
a Lady in the mount of comeliness, that hill of beauty, the true Tsion, and
heavenly Jerusalem, to the worlds admiration. And for my self, I shall
think, I reap abundant fruit of these my travails, if in the day of thy
rejoicing, in the day of the gladness of thy heart, when God shall do these
great things for thee, it may besayd that I have laid one stone, (say it be but
a peble stone) toward thy spiritual building.
