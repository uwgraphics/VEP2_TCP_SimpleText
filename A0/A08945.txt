Britains Honor.
In the two Valiant Welchmen, who fought against fiftenne thousand Scots, at
their now coming to England passing over Tyne; whereof one was killed manfully
fighting against his foes, and the other being taken Prisoner, is now upon
relaxations come to York to his Majesty.
The tune is, How now Mars etc.

YOu noble Britains bold and hardy,
That justly are derived from Brute,
Who were in battle near found t^rdy,
But still will fight for your repute;
against any he,
What ever a' be,
Now for your credit list to me,
Two Welchmens valor you shall see.
These two undaunted Trojan worthies,
(Who prized honor more then life,)
With Royal Charles, who in the North is,
To salve (with care) the ulcerous strife;
Which frantic sots.
With conscious spots,
Bring on their souls; these two hot shots,
Withstood full fifteen thousand Scots.
The manner how shall be related.
That all who are King Charles his friends
May be with courage animated,
Unto such honorable ends;
These cavaliers,
Both Musketeers,
Could never be possessed with fears,
Though the Scots Army nigh appears.
Within their works near Tyne entrenched
Some of our Sovereigns forces lay;
When the Scots Army came, they flinched,
And on good cause retired away;
Yet blame them not,
For why the Scot,
Was five to one, and came so hot,
Nothing by staying could be got.
Yet these two Martialists so famous,
One to another thus did say;
Report hereafter shall not shame us,
Let Welchmen scorn to run away;
Now say our King*
Let Us do a th^^.
Whereof the world shall loudly ring
Unto the grace of our offspring.
The vaunting Scot shall know what valor,
Does in a Britains breast reside:
They shall not bring us any dolor;
But first we will tame some of their pride.
What though we die,
Both thee and I?
Yet this we know assuredly,
In life and death there is victory.
The second part, to the same tune.
With this unbounded resolution,
These branches of Cadwalader;
To put their wills in execution,
Out of their trenches would not stir,
But all night lay,
And would not stray,
Out of the work, and oth' next day,
The Scots past o'r in Battle array.
The hardy Welchmen that had vowed,
Like Jonathan unto his David;
Unto the Scots themselves they showed.
And so courageously behaved
Themselves that they
Would never give way,
But in despite oth' foe would stay,
For nothing could their minds dismay.
Even in the Jaws of death and danger
Where fifteen thousand was to two,
They still stood to it and (which is stranger)
More then themselves they did subdue
Courage they cried;
Lets still abide,
Let Britains fame be dignified,
When two the Scottish hoasts defi'de.
At length (when he two Scots had killed)
One of them bravely lost his life,
His strength and courage few excelled;
Yet all must yield toth' fatal knife.
The other he,
Having slain three,
Did Prisoner yield himself to be,
But now again he is set free.
This is the story of these victors,
Who as they sprung oth' Trojans race,
So they did show like, two young Hectors;
Unto their enemies disgrace;
Hereafter may,
Times children say,
Two valiant Welchmen did hold play,
With fifteen thousand Scots that day.
His Majesty in Princely manner,
To give true virtue its reward;
The man surviving more to honor,
Has in particular regard.
Thus valiant deeds,
Reward succeeds,
And from that branch, which valor breeds,
All honorable fruit proceeds.
Now some may say (I do confess it)
That all such desperate attempts
Spring only from fool hardiness* yet
Who ever this rare deed exempts,
From valor true,
(if him I knew)
I would tell him (and 'twere but due)
Such men our Sovereign has too few.
For surely it is a rare example,
Who now will fear to fight with ten,
When these two lads (with courage ample)
Opposed fifteen thousand men,
Then heigh for Wales,
Scots strike your Sails,
For all your proiects naught prevails,
True Britains scorn to turn their tails.
