The lamentable Ditty of Little Mousgroue, and the Lady Barnet.
To an excellent tune.


AS it fell on a light Holyday,
as many more does in the year,
Little Mousgroue would to the Church and pray
to see the fair Ladies there,
Gaallants there were of good degree,
for beauty exceeding fair,
Most wondrous lovely to the eye, that did to that Church repair.
Some came dawne in red Ueluet,
and others came dawne in Pall,
But next came down my Lady Barnet,
the fairest amongst them all,
She cast a look upon Little Mousgroue,
as bright as the Summers Sun,
Full well perceived then Little Mousgroue,
Lady Barnets Love he had won.
Then Lady Barnet most meek and mild,
saluted this Little Mousgroue,
Who did repay her kind courtesy,
with favor, and Gentle Love,
I have a bower in merry Barnet,
bestrowed with Cowslips sweet,
If that it please you, Little Mousgroue,
in love me there to meet,
Within my Arms one night to sleep,
for you my heart have wanne,
You need not fear my suspicious Lord,
for he from home is gene.
Betide me life, betide me death,
this night I will Sleep with thee,
And for thy sake I Will hazard my breath,
so dear is my love to thee,


What shall we do with our little Foot-Page,
our Counsel for to keep,
And watch for fear Lord Barnet comes,
whil^st we together do sleep?
Red Gold shall be his hier, quoth he,
and Silver shall be his fee.
If he our Counsel safely do keep,
that I may sleep with thee.
I will have none of your Gold, said he,
nor none of your Silver fee,
If I should keep your Counsel, sir,
twere great disloyalty.
I will not be false unto my Lord,
for house nor yet for land,
But if my Lady dos prove untrue,
Lord Barnet shall understand.
Then swiftly runs the little Foot-Page,
unto his Lord with speed,
Who then was feasting with his dear friends,
not dreaming of this ill deed:
Most speedily the Page did haste,
most swiftly did he run,
And when hs came to the broken Bridge,
he lay on his breast and swumme.
The Page did make no stay at all,
but went to his Lord with speed,
That he the truth might lay to him,
concerning this wicked deed.
He found his Lord at supper then,
great merriment there they did keep.
My Lord, quoth he, this night on my word
Mousgroue with your Lady does sleep.
The second part;
To the same tune.


If this be true, my little Foot-Page.
and true as thou tellest to me,
My eldest daughter I Will give to thee,
and wedded shall thou be.
It this be a lie, my little Foot-Page,
and a lie as then tellest to me:
A new pair of Gallows shall straight be set,
and hanged shall thou be.
If this be a lie, my Lord, said he,
a lie that you hear from me,
Then never stay a Gallows to make,
but hang me upon the next tree.
Lord Barnet then called up his merry men,
away with speed he would go,
His heart was sore perplexed with grief,
the truth of this he must know.
Saddle your horses with speed, quoth he,
and saddle me my white Steed,
If this be true as the Page has said,
Mousgroue shall repent this deed.
He charged his men no noise to make,
as they rode all along on the way,
Nor wind no horns, quoth he, on your life,
lest our coming it should betray.
But one of the men that Mousgroue did love,
and respected his friendship most dear,
To give him knowledge Lord Barnet was near,
did wind his Bugle most clear,
And evermore as he did blow,
away Mousgroue and away:
For if I take thee with my Lady,
then slain thou shall be this day.
O hark, fair Lady, your Lord is near,
I hear his little horn blow,
And if he find me in your Arms thus,
then slain I shall be, I know.
O lie still, lie still, little Mousgroue,
and keep my back from the cold*
I know it is my Fathers shepherd,
driving sheep to the Pinfold.
Mousgroue did turn him round about,
sweet slumber his eyes did greet.
When he did wake, he then espied
Lord Barnet at his beds feet.
O rise up, rise up, little Mousgroue,
and put thy Clothes on,
It shall never be said in fair England,
I slew a naked man.
Here Is two good swords, Lord Barnet said,
thy choice Mousgroue thou shall make,
The best of them thy self shall have,
and I the worst will take,
The first good blow that Mousgroue did strike,
he wounded Lord Barnet sore,
The second blow that Lord Barnet gave,
Mousgroue could strike no more.
He took his Lady by the white hand,
all love to rage did convert,
That with his sword in most furious sort,
he pierst her tender heart,
A grave, a grave, Lord Barnet cryde,
prepare to lay us in,
My Lady shall lie on the upper side,
cause she is of the better kin.
Then suddenly he slew himself,
which grieved his friends full sore
The deaths of those three worthy wights
with tears they did deplore.
This sad mischance by full (...)
Then let us call for grace,
That we may shun this wicked deed,
and mend our lives apace.
FINIS.
