The Golden Age: Or, An Age of plaine-dealing.
To a pleasant new Court tune: Or, Whoope do me no harm good man.

COme grant me, come lend me
your listening ears:
The golden Age now again^
plainly appears,
Carowse away sorrow,
and fling away fears,
Leave your wife wealthy,
She Will never shead tears:
Oh this is a golden Age,
Oh this is a Iouiall Age,
The bountiful Lawyer
that never does wrong,
To plead poor men's cases
for price of a song,
Who is by bright Angels
still guided along,
For twenty two shillings,
He Will lend you his tongue,
To plead in this golden Age,
Oh this is a Iouiall Age.
The Ladies have put away
painting and pride,
The foolish French fashion
they cannot abide,
Without Mask or Caroches,
they ciuilly ride,
And to the poor people
Their purses open wide:
Oh this is a bountiful Age,
Oh this is a liberal Age.
Base dealing is banished,
and women grown chaste,
And by their own Husbands
will scarce be embraced,
And will not their times
in idleness waste,
For fear in their carriage
Thou should be disgrac^d:
Oh this is an honest Age,
Oh this is a hopeful Age.
Your Citizens bounty
is grown now of late,
To raise a poor Gallants
decayed estate,
He Will utter his wares
at a reasonable rate,
And unto all comers
Keep open his gate:
Oh this is a bountiful Age,
Oh this is a liberal Age.
The valourous Soldiers
stout manhood is spread*
With arms on his back,
and Helmet on's head,
With Pike and with Musket*
to the field they tread,
While the base Coward
Lies sleeping in bed:
Oh this is a valourous Age,
Oh this is a warlike Age*
The Courtier, his Tailor
does pay with good will,
The Tailor he thinks,
his payment is ill.
But yet if he yearly,
do cancel his Bill,
His only desire is
To deal with him still:
Oh this is a ventering Age,
Oh this is a trusting Age.
The Usurer that lent out
his money before,
Has burned his Bonds,
and lends no more,
Because his broad conscience
oppresses him sore,
The Devil still for him,
^
Oh this is a m^nd^ng Age*
Oh this is (...) Age.
The second Part.
To the same Tune.

THe covetous aged,
do sore bruise their brains,
To make their young Gallants,
sole Lords of their gains:
But being once buried,
full little remains,
But idle consuming
The fruit of their pains:
Oh this is a wasting Age.
Oh this is a spending Age.
The prodigal spender
consumes his wit,
With foolish devices,
his humors to fit,
At Ale and Tobacco,
if he can sit,
Like to a brave Gallant,
Takes he it:
Oh this is a smoking Age,
Oh this is a fiery Age.
Dull Drunkards sit drinking,
and never give over.
Till they have run freely
on the Uintners score,
Brass farthings in charity,
fly to the poor,
While many gold pieces
Are spent on a W --:
Oh this is a dissembling Age,
Oh this is a wanton Age.
Old Robin Russet coat
walks without Cloak,
Amongst our brave Gallants,
with pictures in's poake,
And learnes the new fashion,
to feed upon smoke,
A food far more fitting,
The Devil to choke:
Oh this is a burning Age,
Oh this is a smoking Age.
Grim the black Collier,
brings Coals to the town,
In Sacks more then measure,
yet spends he his crown,
From the broad Pillory,
to keep himself down.
Amongst the blue Beadles,
To purchase renown,
Oh this is an honest Age,
Oh this is a mending Age.
The Baker, the Brewer,
do both mend their size,
And with their plain dealing,
base falsehood defies,
Poor naked conscience,
well clothed now lies,
In their warm Bake-house,
Still held in great prize:
Oh this is a changing Age,
Oh this is a bettering Age.
The Weauer, Miller and Tailor
leave off for to steal,
And with their worke-masters
more honestly deal,
In stead of dry browne-bread,
they make a good meal,
Or else to the Tapsters
We must here appeal*
Oh this is an eating Age,
Oh this is a drinking Age.
All Tradesmen grow weary,
of living by wrong.
The Punke and the Cutpurse
have thriued too long,
The Hangman has haltred
these Raskals up strong:
And so for one penny,
I sell you my Song.
Oh this is a tottring Age,
Oh this is a hanging Age.
At London printed for I. T.
