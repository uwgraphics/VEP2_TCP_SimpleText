Here begins a little book named the Schole house of women: wherein every man
may read a goodly praise of the condicyons of women.

The year of our Lord: M. D. XLi.

THe proverb old, who so denies
Is my conceyte, does greatly arre
Both wit and discrecyo^ ill he applies
That thing of truth, would debar
Howbeit that folks, presume so far
Whereby the truth, is often blamed
Yet in no wise, truth may be shamed
A fool of late, contryued a book
And all in praise, of the femynye
Who so takes labor, it to over look
Shall prove, all is but flatterye
Pehan he calls it, it may well be
The Pecocke is proudest, of his fair tail
And so be all women of their apparayle
Wherefore as now, in this treatise
What so be said, in rude sentence
Virtue to increase, and to lay vice
In chief occasyon, of my pretense
And where that truth is none offense
Who so therefore, that blames me
I say he demeth, wrongfully
Parchaunce the women, take displeasure
Because I rub them, on the gall
To them that good be peradventure
It shall not be, materyall
The other sort, no forse at all
Say what they will, or bend the brewe
Them self shall prove, my saying true
Each other man, in general
And namely those, that married be
Give euydent, testimonyall
Aftermynge the same, if I would lie
And thus report, that femynye
Ben evil to please, and worse to trust
Crabbed and comberous, when them self lust.
Have tongue at large, voice loud and shryl
Of words wondrous, passing store
Stomach stout, with froward will
And namely, when ye touch the sore
With one bare word, or little more
They flusshe and flame, as hot as fire
And swell as a tode, for fervent ire
And where they here, one word ye sou^deth.
Little against, their lewd behauour
And twyse so much else, which that redou^deth
To their hye praise, ye may be sure
So light of ear, they be and sour
That of the better, they never record
The worse rehearse they, word by word
It were much hurt, for to dyscrye
The propertyes all, of the femynyne kind
Howbeit a man may, conjecture nigh
And say also, as experience does bind
That very few, there be to find
But that they can, how soever the mattet stand
Bear fire and water, both in one hand
Euacyons they have, fayut and feeble
Them to excuse, of duplycyte
As though they were inuencyble
Spotted, in any wise to be
And with oaths / so craftelye
They shall be forgyd, on such a ground
As all thing were, both hole and sound
And be it in ernyste, or else in iape
To them it is, one manner a thing
Surely naught else, they after gape
But evermore, in coming
To let a man of his saying
Reason will, they not attend
But tell their own tail, to the end
And for to say, most commonly
This vice, is appropryate to them all
For let a man, to them replye
In reasons, of matters small
These women be, so sensual
That by their reason, not worth a torde
Yet will the woman, have the last word
There may no reason, theyrs debar
Nor none example, can them convert
They stody algate, to be at war
And with evil sawes, to be ouerthwarte
Malice is so roteth / in their heart
That seldom a man, may of them here
One good word, in a hole long year
Albeit the nombre, of them are great
Yet does their folly, far excede
For all is fysshe, that comes to net
In case that they, of their ^ynde spyde
Broche, ring, clothe, or threde
Shame have they none, to tere and snatche
All is their own, that they may catch
What so it be, they finger ones
Of wedded man, or syngle plain
He may as soon, eat the adamunde stones
As the self same, of them to retain
Much they crave, and naught give again
As wholesome for a man, is a woman's corse
As a sholder of motton, for a sick horse
And yet we may not, them long mysse
For many sundry, commodytyes.
So tryckey way, they have no kiss
With mouth, and rollynge eyes
Tongue to tongue, dysclose thyes
One and other, commonly
Have in such case, like propertye
That herd it were, in mine opinion.
If god him self, would company keep
But that would, bring him upon
Waking, or other else a sleep
Displease them ones, and then they weep
By mean whereof, love does the cure
Young fools to keep / in long ure
And whiles, the woyng time does last.
I mean with them, that maidens be
Loathe to dysplease, love sure and fast
Are what ye will, and speed may ye
Few or none, for the most party
Gently entreatyd, deny you can
With her tables, to enter your man
That done they say, that ye did make.
Promise to them, by good assurance
Them to mary, and to wives take
Else had ye not, had such dalyaunce
And all is for fere, of good vtteraunce
In case the belly, do not swell
They hold them pleased, and all is well
Yet must ye be, at ferther danger
If ye do endende, to use them often
Keep them both at rack, and maunger
Array them well, and lay them soft
Yet shall another man, come alofte
Have you ones turned, your eye and back
Another she will have, to smycke and smacke
Perchance the belly, may rise with all.
Then will they swear, and stare apase
That thine it is, when it does fall
Be it mylary, porne or base
Look they say, on thine own face
Behold well, both nose and eye
Nature it self, the father will try
And either there is, a synguler grace
Given unto babe, forth on
Or sure it is, a meruaylous face
That god has given, unto the man
For were they. rx. they must each one
Look they straight, either else a shore
Be like the father, leest and moore
And when they are ones, waxen small
And able to ride, or else to go
Unto like act, again they fall
As who would say, they felt no woe
If ye renounce, kyndnes to sho
The^ must ye send the^, to some strange place
As good a maid, as she before was
Then if there come, a lover new
And them apoynt, whether to come
They be like ready, unto the mewe
And to be close, from wind and son
With little labor, they are soon won
Not one I warrant you, among twentye
But she eftesones, will be as redye
Wed them ones, and then a dew
Fare well all trust, and houswyfrye
Keep their chambres, and them self mewe
For staynynge, of their fysmye
And in their bed, all day do lie
Must ones or twyse, every weke
Feane them self, for to be sick
Send for this, and send for that
Little or nothing, may them please
Come in good gossyp, and keep me chat
I trust it shall, do me great ease
Complain of many, a sundry disease
A gossyps cup, between, or twain
Till she be gotten, up again.
Then must she have, maidens two or three
That may then gossyps together bring
Set them to labor, to blere the eye
Them self will another, wasshe ne wrynge
Bake ne brewe, nor other thing
Sit by the fire, let the maidens trotte
Brewe of the best, in a halpeny pot
Play who will, the man must labor
And bring to house, all that he may
The wife again, does naught but glauour
And hold him up, with ye and nay
But of her cup / he shall not assaye
Other she says, it is to thine
Other else ywis, there is nothing in.
And when these gossyps are ones motte.
Of every tail, and new tidynge
They babble fast, and nothing forget
They put (I warrant) between rydyng
This learn the younger, of the elders guydynge
Day by day, keeping such schools
The semple men, they make as fools
Them self always, do make good chere
With one or other, they never rest
Our Johan shall pay, that is not here
How say you gossyp, is it not best
I beshrewe his heart / now is he bleste
He bet me gossyp, I may tell you
That yet I am, both black and blewe
Thus out it shall / what so it be
Good or bad, all is one thing
What soever comes, to memory
Shall not be lost, for the tellinge
God wot they make, many a lesynge
Hit does their stomach / greatly ease
To learn what may / their husbands displease.
The young complayneth unto the old
Somewhat to ease, their hertes therbye
The elder says / good gossyp behold
To show your mind, hollye to me
Fere it not, ye know pardye
That I have been, both old and young
Both close and sure / of tail and tongue.
Then says the younger, I may tell you
I am so matchet, as no woman is
Of all this night, till the cock crewe
He would not ones, turn me for to kiss
Every night, he ryseth to pysse
And when he comes / again vnwarme
Does turn his ars / in to my barme
Lappeth him self, round all about
And thrusts me / out of my place
Leaves me scantly, one ragge or cloute
To cover and cast, over my face
Full little manner / gossyp he hase
The most vnkyndest, man have I
That ever woman, laid her by
And be the day, never so long
He does nothing, but chyde and braull
Ye ye gossyppe, the more is my wrong
Hoar and herlot, he does me call
And byddes me gossyp, scrape and scrall
And for my living, labor and sweet
For as of him, no penny I get
I was a curste, or else stark mad
And when I married, with him unwise
I may tell you, I might have had
Another manner of man, then he is
If I had followed, my friends advise
I should have had, a mynyan
A man of land, a gentylman
The deuyls gossyp, ought me a shame
And paid I am now, every penye
Would god he had, be blind and lame
That day and hour, he first woed me
Ware not gossyp, these children three
I would not tarry, ye may be sure
Longer with him, day ne hour
Then says the elder, do as I do
Be sharp and quycke, with him again
If that he chyde, chyde you also
And for one word, give you him twayue
Keep him short, and have dysdayne
He should use you, after such rate
Bid him be still, with one evil date
Cherysshe your self, all that ye may
And draw unto, good company
Cast not your self, gossyp away
Because he plays, the churl with the
And by your will, keep him hungree
And bid him go, when he would game
Unto his customers, god give him shame
Be ever with him, at yea and nay
And by your will, begin the war
If he would smite, then may ye say
Go to hardely, if thou so dare
I besh rewe thy heart, if that thou spare
All the world, shall wonder on the
How thou do wroke, thy tene of me
Because thou have be, at the dyse
And playde away, all that thou haste
Or from thy gylloutes, thou could not rise
Of all this day, ye sat so fast
And now god, give the shame at last
Come dronken home, with a myschefe
And would be revenged, upon thy wife
Better ywys, to hold thy hand
And more is, for thine honestye
I had lever thine neck, where in a band
Then I would take it, long of the
Trust me, I will find remedy
Smite and thou dare, I make god auowe
I will acquyte it, I wot well how
In case there be, no remedy
But that ye must, have strokes sad
Take up the babe / that then is nigh
Be it wenche, or be it lad
And bid him stryke, if he be mad
Smite hardely, and kill thy son
And hang therefore, when thou have done
Thus among, they keep such schools
The young to draw, after the old
Motyng ever / upon theyrs stoles
Of every matter, that they have would
By mean whereof, the young wax bold
So that within, a month they be
Quarter master, or more then he
Truly some men, there be
That live always, in great horror
And say it goes, by destenye
To hang or wed, both has one hour
And whyther it be, I am well sure
Hanging is better, of the twain
Sooner done, and shorter pain
On pilgrimage, then must they go
To wylesdon, barkyng, or some halowes
Perchance be forth, a night or two
On foot for werynge, of horse shows
A vyage make, unto the stews
And neither knele, to stones, ne stocks
But the offering take, with a quycke box
Sometime also, license they crave
To be with some neighbor, in ye mydwyues stead
And all to the end, some other knave
Shall dubbe her husband, a somer bird
The truth is so known, it can not be hyde
Albeit that few men, do him here
The kucko, syngeth every year
They have also another cast
In case the husband, be present
The child I warrant, shall be cast
And to her lover, therewith sent
The sylly man, none evil meant
Regards little, or nothing this
How by the babe, she sendes her kys
And for she would, by rekened true
The matter to cloak, more craftily
Her kynsman call him, I warrant you
And to blere, the husbands eye
God wot the blind / eats many a fly
So does the husband, often ywis
Father the child, that is not his
Trym them self, every day new
And in their glasses / poor and prye
Plat and plant, and their herys hew
And all to make it, for the eye
The fynest ware, that they may bye
And all that ever / they may ymagyne
Is to enlure, the masculyne
Paynt them round, with many a pyn
Rynged for routyng, of pure gold
Fair without, and foul within
And of their tails / have slypper hold
Bye who will / ware will be sold
Ye need go farther, the fair is here
Bye when ^e list / it lasts over year
Spare for no cost / but drink of the best.
And also of every, deyntye eat
Hot in operation / and light to dygest
Nature to provoke, and set on a heat
Oysters, kocles, and else what they may yet
Now this, now that, and feign them self sick
Such things to receive / as for their phisyck
By mean whereof, Tyresyas
Arbyter chose, the truth to dyscus
Give judgment plain, in this case
That the woman is: far more lecherous
Gallus gallinus, ter quinque sufficit vnus
Sed ter quinque viri / non sufficient mulieri
In case they would / ought of you crave.
Anon they weep, and lowre a pace
And say that they / can nothing have
Them to apparel, as other wives hase
Trust not ouermoche, their morning face
Record enough, of Samsons two wives
who follows their minds / seldo^ when thryues
Albeit the byrder, with his blered eye
Dyssemble sorrow / with his sad face
Yet is there no bird, he may come by
By his engynes / that may have grace
By women it follows / in semblable case
Weep they or laugh they: all is one thing
They deal most craftly, when they be weeping
And yet among / who so will thryue
And office bear, in town or city
Must needs be ruled, by his wife
Or else in fay, it will not bye
The wife must able him, to the degree
Able or unable, little cares she
Because her self, would honored be
Fear not she says, unto her spouse
A man or a mouse, whyther be ye
Should ye, your honestly refuse
And be as like, as other men be
In person, and in each degree
Take it upon you, do not refuse
And I mine own self, find your house
So by the mean, of her counsel
The man may not, the office forsake
Because the wife, would have a tail
Come rakyng after, and a bonet black
A velvet heed, and also be take
With the best and not the worste
The man must be ruled: till all be in the dust.
Of all the dyseases, that ever wore.
Wedding is next unto the gout
A saulue there is, for every sore
To help a man within, or without
But of these two, I am in dowte
No pain so fervent, hot ne cold
As is a man, to be called cockolde
And be never, so fearful to fraye
So stark a cowarde, yet will he rage
And draw his knyfe, even straight way
Be he never so far in eage
Call him ones cockolde, and his corrage
Furthwith will kyndle, and force him stryke
Worse then ye, named him heretyke
And syeth there is, no salve therefore
^it puts many, a man in fere
To be infecte, with the self same sore
How well so ever, they them bear
Good taken have they, also else where
That whosoever weddeth a wife
Is sure of sorrow / all his life
Of Socrates, the pacyent
Example good / of his wives twain
Which on a time / fell at dyssent
And unto him, did them complain
He laughed thereat / and they again
Fall both on him, with an evil date
A pyspot they brake, upon his pate
He held him pleased, and well content
The pysse ran down / by his chekes twane
Will wist I, said he, what it meant
And true it is, that all men said
That after thonder, comes rain
Who has a wife, is sure to find
At home in his house, many a sour wind.
A certain wife, said to me ones
I would thou knew it, god made us
Another of earth, stock ne stones
But of a thing, much precious
Of a rybbe of a man, scripture says thus
Because the woman, in every need
Should be help to the man, in word and deed
Man made of earth, and woman of man
As of a thing, most pryncypall
Which argues well, says she then
By judgment just, and reason natural
That we be ever substantyall
And yet ye men, thus of hus babble
That women always are varyable
Which thing, as far as I se can
Should be employed, rather to you
Sith of the earth, god create man
And fygures thereof, makes ever new
Nature thus naturate, me seems now
Must needs, his first orygynall
Ensewe, or be unnatural.
As ye say (said I) help him well
Evil to thryue, and worse to fare
Who was the cause, that Adam fell
His wife or no^ I make you ware
One and other, little ye care
So ye may have, that ye desire
Though dun, and the pack, lie in the mire
Made of a bone, ye said were ye
Truth it is, I can not denaye
Crooked it was, styffe, and sturdye
And that would bend, no manner way
Of nature like, I dare well say,
Of that condicyon, all women be
Evil to rule, both styffe, and sturdye
And over that, who lysteth to try
Put me two bones, in a bag
Or mo as it is, of quantyte
That done, hold it somewhat sagge
Shake it also, that it may wagge
And ye shall here, none other matter
Of these bones, but clytter clatter
Like so of women, in field and town.
Assembled where, that many be
A man may hear them, by the sown
Farther far, then the eye may se
Wherefore men say / most co^menlye
Where many geese be, are many tordes
And where be women, are many words.
And so the husband, is like to have
A synguler treasure, of his wife
He needs never, an ill word to crave
All the days, of his long life
Has not that man, a prerogatyue
That may always, of his wife have
A thing of naught, and it not crave
And commonly, where cause is none
Some thing ymagyned is kept in store
Which that she may, come the good man home
With spedefull spirit, lay him before
Of little or naught, they make much more
And be it true, or false they tell
All is sothed, as the gospel
And yet the rybbe, as I suppose
That god did take, out of the man
A dog up caught, and away gose
Eat it clean, so that as than
The work to fynysshe, that god began
Could not be, as we have said
Because the dog, the rybbe conuayde
A remedy, god found as yet
Out of the dog, he took a rybbe
The woman forthwith he made of it
As to the man, neither kynne nor sybbe
Nature she follows, and plays the gyb
And at her husband, does bark and ball
As does the curre, for naught at all
Another reason, if ye mark well
Does cause the woman, of words be ryue
A certain man, as fortune fell
A woman tongles, wedded to wyue
Whose fronyng countenance, perceyuyng belyue
Till he might know, what men thought long
And wysshed full often, she had a tongue
The devil was ready, and appeared anon
An aspen leaf, he bad the man take
And in her mouth, should put but one
A tongue said the devil, it shall her make
Till he had done, his heed did ache
Leaves he gathered, and took plentye
And in her mouth / put two or three
Within a while, this medicyne wrought
The man could tarry, no longer time
But wakened her, to the end he might
The virtue prove, of the medicyne
The first word, she spoke to him
She said thou horson, knave, and thief
How durst thou waken me, with a mischefe
From that day forward, she never ceased
Her boyster babell, greuyd him sore
The devil he met, and him entreated
To make her tongles, as she was before
Not so said the devil, I will meddle no more
I devil, a woman to speak may constrayne
But all that in hell be, can not let it again
And by proof, daily we se
What inclynacyon nature makes
The aspyn lefe, hanging where it be
With little wind, or none it shakes
A woman's tongue, in like wise takes
Little ease, and little rest
For if it should, the heart would breast
Look when the sea, does water want
Nor no wind blows, to mylne the walk
When Ethna hill, of fire is scant
The crown white, and black is chalk
Then women cease, will of their talk
It is like appropryed, all women to babble
As dogs to bark, and geese to gagle
And that more is, all men do say
That woman to man, is most comfort
Howbeit they mean it, another way
And say she is, man's utter extorte
And over that, by just report
The smaller pease, the mo to the pot
The fayrer woman, the more gyllot
The fayrer of face, the brouder of heart
The lother to woo, the sooner won
The less of speech, the more overthwart
Not one so dangerous, as is dame dun
The fouler she is, the sooner it is done
So short of hele / they be over all
That and if ye blow / they must needs fall
By mean whereof, all men report
And say that women, can not be stable
For be one gone, and other resort
And profereth them, thing seruysable
Our fyly is fetlyd, unto the sadle
Ride who will, shod is our mare
And thus they eschaunge, ware for ware
In case thou would, not have it so
But rather to find / every thing well
I counseyle the before thou go
Forth of town, to crowche and knele
And offer a candell, to the devil
Parcase thy wife would, be so lewed
He would for let it, all beshrewed
Example thereof, and that was this.
A certain man, from home should ride
Which fearyng his wife, would do amys
To an image of Satan, upon a wall side
Offered a candell, and that was espyde
And said sir Satan, now I charge the
My wife in mine absence, thou do over se
His journey ended, came home again
And the self image, went straight unto
The devil him showed, every thing plain
How he had let, that should have be do
And from her bacwarde, drawn one or two
The daungerest cure, that ever he had
Was to keep good, that would have been bad
Another thing as pryncypals
Be not with her, in Ialosye
What mysaduenture, so ever befall
Forbid her no man's company
Nor yet rebuke her / syngulerly
In case thou do, though thou had sworn
A blaste shall thou blow, in Nynerus horn
For as we se, by experyence
Every day before our eye
And by report of men of credence
For the most part / the femynye
By their innatyue, destynye
First and formest, when they be chyd
Will that thing do, they be forbid
And over that, thy wife present
I counseyle the, be wise and ware
Thou praise, no other man's instrument
Better then thine own, berynge ware
For if thou do, she will not spare
Were he never, so natural a fool
Till she have assayed, the self same tole
So frail they be, of disposycyon
So crooked, so crabbed, with that so ill.
So lewed, so shrewed, light of condicyon
That sure, it were impossible
To let them, of their own self will
And but it ^ome, of their own mind
A man were as good, throw stones at ye wind
Say what ye will, they will do as the^ lust
The proof thereof, in a certain fable
I husband man, having good trust
His wife to him, had be agreeable
Thought to attempt / if she had be reformable
Bad take the pot, that sod over the fire
And set it above, upon the astyre
She aswered him, I hold the mad
And I more fool, by saint Martyne
The dinner is ready, as thou me bad
And time it were that thou should dyne
And thou will not, I will go to mine
I bid the said ^e, bear up the pot
A ha she said, I trow thou dote
Up she goes, for fear at last
No questyon moved, where it should stand
Upon his head, the potage she cast
And held the pot, still in her hand
And toward him, she cursed and band
Said and swear, he might her trust
She would with the potage, do what her lust
No remedy, to dyscontent.
To tratle to them, of reason or law
For be a woman's, purpose bent
Nothing preualeth, to withdraw
Nor yet to keep / them under awe
Give them counsel, the best ye can
They will follow their own will, now and than
Look of discrecyon, few womanly
And to the were few, profitable
Not three I dare say, among thyrtye
That be dyscrete, and reasonable
And yet always, they bible babble
Of every matter, and make it nyse
And in conclusyon, be wondrous peuysshe
As holy as saints, in church they be
And in street as angels they were
At home, for all their ypocrysye
A deuylysshe life, they led all the year
When lenton comes, then to the friar
The friar lymlyfter, for a pair of pense
Will for all causes, with them dyspense
And that more is, I dare auowe
That if thy wife, dyspleasure take
Be it right or wrong, yet thou
Must needs of forse, for thy wives sake
Fight and fraye, and hye words crake
Swear and state, as who would say
Thou would not let, to kill and slaye
In case thou take the matter light
As man of peace, love and concord
Then will the weep, anon forth right
And give the many, an evil word
And bid the gyrde, to the thy sword
And say, if I had married a man
This thing should not, be long undone
Record, the wicked Iesabell.
Which would have stayne / good Helyas
Record also of the gospel
The wife of Phylyp / Herodyas
Which through her daughter, brought to pas
That Herod her granted, or that they wyste
To give her the heed / of Johan Baptyst
Thus were them self, may little do
As in regard of corporal might
Of cruelnes they rest not so
But stere their husbands, for to fight
The proverb old, accords right
Women and dogs, causes much strife
And most occasyons, to be myschefe
In case that thou, so foolysshe be
For thy wives words, to make a brall
If it so fortune, that she do it see
Regards little, what may befall
The first thing, that she does of all
On the she runs, and holds the still
Whiles that an other, may the kill
And if it chance, any unkind word
Escape thy mouth, whereby that ye
Between your self / fall at dyscorde
Trust me well / in case that she
By any mean / may master the
For the most part, all women be
In such case, all without pytye
Weak and feeble, albeit they be
Of body / much impotent
Example daily, yet may ye se
Comberous they be, and malyuolente
Harmeles creatures, none evil mente
The upper hand, if they ones get
Can no more harm, then amerseset
Who was so busye, as was the maid.
With crooked language, Peter to appose
Ones, twyse, or thryse, to him she said
And thou fellow, art one of those
The truth said she / thy language showse
Peter abashed, swore and denayde
And all by reason, of the lewd maid
Some men their be also, that say
Be she syngule, or be she wedde
To much she coueyteth, of chamber play
As did Byblis, the thing forbed
Presume to be, in her mother stead
Myrrha also, inordynatelye
With her own father, found means to lie
The daughters twain, of Loath the sage.
Having like tykle, in their tail
Could not refrain, their wylfull rage
To satisfye, with evil hayle
Their father fested, with costly vytayle
Made him drunk, and so at last
Meddled with him, he slepynge fast
Examples hereof, diverse there be
To approve my saying, straight as a line
As first of the, abhomynable Pasyphe
And then the insacyat, myssalyne
Pyrra, Fabulla, and fair Helyne
With other thousands, many mo
Which all to recyte, would never be do
I pray you, why was Adam shent.
Because he only, did transgress
Eve him meuyd, first to consent
To eat of the apple, she did him dress
So all came, of her wylfulnesse
And sith that woman, that office began
She is more to blame then is the^ man
The wife of loath, willing also
The will of god, to preuarycate
Out of the city, when she should go
Looked behind her, in her gate
To se by proof, the pronostycate
Displeased god, and she anon
Transfourmed was, in to a salt stone
I pray you, what did queen atthalye
Look in Paralypomenon
Mother of young king Othozye
Of all, and of all, the wylfullest one
Moved the king foresaid, her son
To do much evil, especyallye
The temple of god, for to dystroye
Mighty Samson, two wives had
The first a Philistian, by generacyon
Neither of them good, but passing bad
And false to him, far out of fasshyon
The first him caused, by lacrymacyon
His problem to her, so that he said
When she it knew, she him betrayde
The second delte much worse then so
Deceyuynge him, as ye shall hear
For she his strength / did take him fro
In her lap slepyng, she clypte his here
Betrayed her lord, and her bewpere
Thus Dalyda, for mede him served
And caused his eyes out to be carved
The wife of Job, the man elect
Saluted him with scorns and mockes
And full unseemly, often him cheete
Saying thou foul, full of the pockes
Full like a fool, thy breast thou knockes
Wenest thou, for thy fair speech
God will come, the for to seche
Thy pratynge leave, foul the befall
Trust me, he will the never hele
Thy beestes / thy goods, and thy children all
Be deed and breute, now every dele
And thou lie here, with many a byle
Pratynge, and prayenge, to the divine
And worse then thou stynkest, then a deed swyne
Likewise the wife, of old Thoby
Whose name, as I remember was Anne
Which him entratyd, bosteously
With sad rebukes, now and than
Called him dryuyll, and wytles fan
Because he gave / with heart so lyberall
Part of his goods, to the porall
The wanton wife, of king Pharao
Joseph adhortyd / with her to lie
In place secret, between them two
God forbid madame said he
Because she saw, it would not be
A shameful lie she did invent
In prison to cast / that innocent
In women all, this propertys
Is known sure, and manyfeste
That if a man, may come so nigh
To show them game, that they love best
And will not do it, then well they Ieste
But trust me sure, that with the heart
They will never love him afterwarte
The wise man says, in his proverbs
A strumpettes lyppes are dulce as honye
But in her dealing, she is sour as herbs
Wormewode, or rewe, or worse says he
For when them lyketh, to mock with the
With tongue and eye, such semblaunce the show.
That hard it were them to mystrowe
As though they spoke, with mouth and heart
With face they make, so good semblaunce
That hard it were, a man to starte
From their fair glosynge, countenance
Thus with their sugered, vtteraunce
The simple men / that mean but just
Disceyued are, where they most trust
In case they do you, but one benefyte
An hundredth times by you recompensed
They will you ever, with that one entwyte
With little cause, or none offensed
All your demerytes, shall be vnrecensed
So be it less, or be it more
All is lost, ye gave them before
If ye renounce, your copy hold
And would be tenant, by Indenture
There is no ware, then to be sold
Ye must go seek, at your adventure
For as of you, they have no deynture
Think ye that I, will be so ready
Nay by Iesse, I hold you a penny
And then if ye, no labor make
Ye may be sure that then will she
The lure out throw, the hawke to take
Be like, of her affinyte
Good god how strange, now adays be ye
I would have thought, ye had been none such
But by the little, is known the much
So at length, by howche or by crowche,
Less or more, ever they crave
Untyll the hand, be in the pouche
No words prouaylen, the to save
A thousand thousand ways they have
To make a man, a threde bare cote
And leave him, neither penny ne grote
Now this now that, they crave always
One thing or other, they never rest
Say what ye will, they will no nay
Nor none excuse, but their own request
So they may be trymmed, and fed of the best
They have no remorse, who bears the name
Nor whom they put to open shame
The truth is known as in this case
By holy write, autenticate
Between Thamer, and the judge Judas
The book called Genesis, examynate
How thamar the wydowe, in the way sat
D^sgysed her self, in strange array
Judas to dysceyue, after that way.
Her fresshe atyre, and countenance thereto
Provoked this man, a questyon to make
She lightly consenting, as some other do
Said what wylt you give, thy pleasure to take
Some pledge she said, for promise is slake
Of him she required, staff mantell and ring
His mind to follow, and do the thing
Short tail to make, the law was then
A woman that found was, in auoutrye
Dew proffe allege, by credyble men
Should suffer death, saunce remedy
The matter apperyd, by her belly
She openly said, in sclaunder of Judas
Who owes these three, this deed done has
Thus be they all, past shame and dread.
And cares not, who does bid them bail
With goostly sentence, them to feed
Little or nothing, does them prevail
Be the back turned, anon they rail
And say, for all your counseyle good
Ye had lever a bare ars, then a furred hood.
To say that they can, counseyle keep.
It were to me, a meruaylous thing
Unless it be, when they do sleep
Or no body, to give the hearing
Desirous ever, of new tydynge
And were it matter, of lymme and life
Out it shall, be told believe
Tully the Roman, upon a day
Though to approve, his wife secrye
In counseyle told her, he had put away
The Emperor son, to the end that we
May reygne and rule, both land and see
Glad was she, and yet she went
And him dysclosed, incontinent
Tully escaped, hard with the life.
And all by mean / of his own folly
Had not the truth, be known belyue
To have be hanged / it was ieoperdye
Be it therefore true tale, or lie
Be wise and ware, wake ye or wynke
And tell not your wife, all that ye think
King Solomon, both wyttye and wise
A woman does, assymylate
Unto a droppynge, euesynge guyse
Dystyllynge down, after rain late
Who drops unclean, does maculate
The fynest vesture, that any man werys
With cold and wete, the body derys
Even so a woman / litygyous
Disquieteth, a hole householde
And who so he be, that in his house
Entendeth to keep, a woman skolde
The wind that blows, both moist and cold
Were better far, for to herpour
And less should find, of dyspleasure
Enuyous they be, it is daily seen
And proud also, of comparyson
Record of Saba, the gorgyous queen
Before, nor syns, was never such one
Because she enuyed, king Solomon
To prove his wisdom, and take with a tryppe
Passed the sees, in a meruaylous ship
Because that Naboth, would not sell
Unto the king, of Samarye
The vyneyarde he had, at Israel
Achab the king, became angrye
As soon as Iesubell, the queen knew why
She straytly commanded, by writing to feign
Some crime upon Naboth, and so was he slain
Look and read, the book Bockas
And ye shall find, many a reason
The pride of women, to deface
For their m^slyuynge, in their season
Good women he wrote, were very geson
As ye shall find of, ri^he wrote
But of the. xx. neither letter nor jot
Salamon says, three things there be
Seldom, or never saturate
^ell the first, is of the three
The second, a woman's water gate
The ground of water / insacyate
Of every lewd fassyon, reckon who can
And ever I warrant, the woman is one.
Hard to be known, like membre therbe
The fourth to know, who is he con
The first which way, a bird will flee
Or of a serpent, sprent from a stone
What haven a ship, shall be drive upon
The craft of a hoar, perceive who con
And ever I warrant the woman is one
The ground also / does vary by three
The fourth may not, be stablysshed sure
A bond man set, in majesty
A fool fed fat, whiles he will in power
An odyous woman, in wedding ure
An heir made of, a bond woman
So ever I warrant, the woman is one.
Which things remembered, well nere each man
Report of them, accordyngly
And say plainly, that in the woman
Is little thing, of praise worthy
Lettred or unlearned, whether they be
They say of all creatures, women are the best
Cuius contrarium, verum est
And were not, two small venyalles
The femynyne might, be gloryfyde
Set in thrones perpetualles
And as the gods, be deyfyde
Two venyall sins, they have and hyde
None of the seven, their names who can tell
They can neither do, nor say well
So to conclude, of this treatise
A fynall end, rude though it be
The process through, who will superuyse
Shall well perceive, I make no lie
An end therefore, to make shorflye
In my conceyte / he lives in rest
That medleth with them, of all people leest.
FINIS.
Go forth little book, be not afraid
To be accept, with them that are wise
And show them plain, what so be said
In any part of this treatise
Does not dystayne, their honestyse
But for the lewd, might have a myrrour
Hereby to amend, their damnable error
Like as the preacher, does dysco^mende.
All vycyous living, with mouth and will
Or as the mynstryll, does endend
With help of lute, finger or quyll
Example she wyng, to convert the ill
Like so mine auctour, does the same
No creature living, spoken be name
Percase any one, dyspleasure take
Because it touches, her properlye
In case that she / such ways forsake
Which most accord, to her propertye
She needs not, herewith to be angrye
God grant us all, we may do this
Every man to amend one, in that is amys
The good always / will be content
With that, that is spoken / in general
There will none / so soon be dyscontent
As they that fretesyd, be with all
Rub a scalde horse / upon the gall
And he will byte, wynse, and vente
So will all people, that are malyuolent.
Go forthotherfore, among the thycke
And bear in mind, who is with the
The words that Salamon, and David speak
In Iudicium, and in Genesye
Hierome, Iuuenall, and old Thobie
Cathon, and Ouyd, will testyfyue
And Marcyall also, who lysteth to try.
And unto them, that learned be
I would, and will, thou mekely went
And show them, who so made the
Nothing purposed, of ill intent
That should prohyoyte the sacrament
But that the masculyne, might hereby
Have somewhat to ieste, with the feminy
