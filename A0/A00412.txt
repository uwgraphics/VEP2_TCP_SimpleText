late translated out of Italian into English, with convenient tables in the
end of the book.

O maiestas domini, quantu^ inclinaris.
Cum Deus ex femina oriri dignaris.
Nu^quid in palac^s, rex coeli locaris?
Non, sed in praesepio breui reclinaris.

Jesus qui angelico coetu veneratur.
Vestibus purpureis natus non ornatur.
Sed in satis vilibus pannis inclinatur.
Sicque mundi gloria^ pauper detestatur.
TO MY DEAR AND LOVINGE countreywomen and sisters in Christ assembled together
to serve God, under the holy order of S. Briget in the town of Rone in
France.
THis discourse treating of the vanity and contempt of the world, after I
had perused, and in mine own opinion conceived, a special liking thereof: I
fell into some desire with my self, to have it made common, to certain of my
freindes and vvelvvillers, such as I wist well would like of the argument,
and would be delighted to see it well and co^ningly handeled: And because I
cold not have the effect of my desire, nor they, the fruit of that good, I
wished them, except it were made co^municable by some man's travail and
industry, in reducing it out of the spannishe or Italian language, (wherein
it was first written) into our vulgar and mother tongue. I thought good,
since I vvanted not goodvvill, and thereto had store of good leisure, being at
that time secluded from all company (rather then to leave so good a work
undone, that might tend to the benefit of many) to adventure what I cold do
my self therein, and by mine own experience to make trial, what a mean
diligence was able to do, eue^ in the most unusual exercises whereinto
when I was entered, being daily drawn with desire to see so good a work
at an end, and continually entised forvvard with the svveetenes of the work
and soundnes of the matter, and the good handelinge thereof, I found no great
difficulty in the attempt, but passed through the same, in a much shorter
time, then I supposed it possible for me (at the first) to have done.

Thus love makes labor light, and hard things are made easy by delighte:
yea even the vearie thing it self, that this book entreats of, which to us
worldly men, is of all others the most hard, as that which our corrupted
nature most misliketh and abhors, is made by love, not only easy, but most
pleasant and delectable. We see daily how the wicked and ungodly, leave
no mischief undone, what danger so ever they incur, in the doing thereof,
to have their pleasure, and satisfy their desire, which is caused only, by
the perverse love and lewd affection, over firmly fixed upon the things
that they fancy and desire. It seems that love alone, is the directer and
guide of all our actions, either good, or evil, so as the well, or evil
orderinge thereof does make us either good or evil.

Nothing then can be more convenient for us, ^hen to have a good order and
method proposed, what is meet to be beloved and followed, and what is meet
to be detested and eschevved. This ^ath been the teachinge of almighty God him
self, from the beginning of the world. It was ^he first lesson that he
taught our father Adam (...) Paradise, when he gave him and order what ^e
should take, and what he should refuse. Both ^he law and the prophets
tended to no other end, ^ut to instruct the people what they should love and
^lovve, and what they should hate and avoid.

Our Savior Christ him self coming in ^^she to redeem mankind, preached
no other ^octrine to the world but this. His holy Apostles ^^d teachers
sithence, have trauayled about no ^^^er thing. The scope of all, that has
been ^^ther well taught or written in the world ^^till this day, has been
to no other effect, but ^^^ly to instruct us aright, what we have to ^^vve,
and what to fly, and to prescribe us or^^^lie means, which way we should
do it best.

Amongst those that have labored in this ^^d business, and have bestovved their
trauaills ^^framyng and co^pilinge some necessary work ^^hich might aptly
teach the way to live ^^ell, and to rectefie the mind of man, in the ^^fect
and true love of God, and contempt of the ^^orld, which be as it were, two
inseparable co^^^ions, and have their connection alvvayes together, so as we
can not love God, but if vv^ contemn the world, nor contemn the world (...)
we ought, if we love not God. Amongst (...) (I say) that have taken pains
in gods Church, (...) teach the ready way to a good life, none hat^ (in my
small judgment) more happily achieved that which he has gone about, then
the auth^^ of this book, who leadinge a most religious an^ contemplative life
him self, has by due obser^uation, and diligent labor, chosen out so man^
good rules and precepts for that purpose, and hat^ as aptly applied them, and
in so good order digested them, so bevvtefyinge them with apt sim^^litudes and
sentences of holy scripture, to ma^^ them asvvell h^dthfull as grateful, that
heard (...) were (I think) any where to find a vvorke^ better fruit, and
more likely to profit the re^^der.

And as it is now made familier to oth^^ christian nations abroad, and well
received (...) the^, so can I not think, but that it shall be asvv^ vvellcome
to you, when you are once made a^^quaynted therevvith, but if the habit that
(...) comes clothed in, does seem over rude and ho^^ for so good a guest,
remember I pray you, fir^^ from whom it comes and at whose hands* has
received this simple array, next to vvho^ it goes that is, to them that have
wholy, both (...) act, and will, utterly cast of, the desire (...)
^vorldlie conversation, so as to you the difference (...) not great, betwixt
a kendall coat, and a pur^e Roabe, the substance not the shevve, is that
^vhich you desire.

Lastly the book it self is such as asks (...) outvvarde settinge out, nor
glorious show of ^vordes, the whole argument thereof, entrea^ge of nothing
else, but only of the contempt of the ^vorld, and the vanity thereof, so as it
were nei^^er agreeable with the matter, nor convenient (...) the persons, to
come either richly arrayed, or ^y better then meanly appareled. If the
letter self be truly expressed, and the authors mind ^^thfullie delivered, I
have that I sought for, ^^s it that which I trauayled to do, both for (...)
own honesty, and the readers satisfaction, ^^vv well I have fulfilled it,
let the learned ^^der be Judge, unto whose examination and ^^sure I refer
it. My travail herein I have ^ore others dedicated unto you, for that I
^^ughte it a meet work for you, and the ar^^ment thereof so well agreeing
with your pro^^ion. Wherein if you find any furtherance (...) means of any
help that does arise to you by (...) small pains taken herein, I pray you of
your ^^aritie, that for my pains, you will afforde (...) part of your
prayers, and by your interces^^^ entreat for me at goods hands, that vvhi^^
I seek to carry a candle to give others light I walk not in darkness my
self, and lose (...) comfort of that, which I procure to get for oth^^
folk, but that if I chance to trippe or stomble (...) my way (as God
knovveth I do full often) yet (...) may the sooner by your good healpe recover
m^ self again, and escape the everlasting ruin (...) my soul, so as at the
last after these hard storme^ be past, I may by gods mercy be received to some
piece of his glory. Fare ye well, and God send yo^ the assistance of his holy
spirit to conduct you (...) the end of your well begone journey. Amen* From

OF THE DESPIsinge the vanity of the world. The first part.
^ovv that we can neither taste of God, nor enjoy any spiritual delighte and
divine comfort, if first we despise not the world, and the Pleasures thereof.
CHAP. 1.
NO man can serve twoe masters says Christ our Savior. Mat. 6.
The comfort that is of God, is sweet and delectable, but this is not for all
men, but for those only which de^ise the vanities of the world. It is
im^ossible to taste of God, and to love dis^^dinat^ie the things of this life:
All men ^^ulde gladly enjoy the sweet conuer^ion of our Lord, but few there
be that ^ll forgo their own commodities, and ^^linglie despise the earthlye
delights. They desire greatly to have the inward comfort of the soul, but
with all they desire to satisfy their own appetites. But if thou will follow
Christ, thou must deny thy self.

Thou must withdraw thy self from the world, if thou think to enjoy God,
for God and the world be contrary, they have nothing common betwixt them,
neither may they inhabit together: ca^^ of therefore the love of the world,
if thou will that God shall have access to thy soul: Neither may thou
fully taste o^ the sweetenes of God, until thou does^ find that the pleasures
of the world be waxen bitter unto the, and unpleasant* And when thou shall
account of these wordlie things to be hard and harshe of taste, then shall
thou find thy soul disposed to receive the inward comfort^ of Jesus Christ.
For as it is impossible for the with one eye to look upward to he^^uen, and
with the other to look downewarde to the earth: so is it against reason to
have thine affections here on these earthly things, and enjoy withal the
spiritual co^fortes of heaven. If thou will enjoy God it is necessary for
the to de^pryue thy self of all kind of wordlie (...) sensual comfort: That
comfort which comes from man, must needs be vile an^ of no acco^pte, since
it hyndreth the com^forte which comes from God.

Thou must not seek for God in the ple^^sant fields, nor in delightsome
gardens, neither in the pleasures of this world, Since Moses one so dear
unto him, Exd. 3.
found him out amongst the thorney busshes of hard penance and sharpenes of
life. Therefore do those worldlinges never deserve to find him, that do not
seek him any where, but amongst pleasures and delights. But fly from all
worldly comfort as much as thou may and then shall thou be refresshed at
gods own hand. Dispatch all worldly care from thy soul, to the intent that
their may be place for the love of God to rest therein where it may be
suerlie planted, and take fast rootinge.

God would not permit that his holy Arc and the idol Dagon should have
both one Altar. 1. Reg. 5.
And allthoughe the Philistines did earnestly labor to have it so, yet could
they never bring it to pass that they might both abide together. God will not
that the Idol of vice, which thou do adore, should have any place there,
where as his divine person remains: he co^senteth not that the world and he
should be adored together.

And therefore if thou will love God, as thou ought to do, thou must not
set by the glory of this world. Exodus 2.
God never appeared unto Moses whilst he remained in Egipte, no more owghtest
thou to have any hope of seeing him, whilst thou ^iuest in darkness of the
world. Refuse the Palace of Pharao, despising the honors and vanities in
which thou live, that thou may find in the desert of solitary life, (as
Moses did) the help of God and his spiritual comfortes. Exodus 16.


VVhilest the flesh pottes of Egipte do savor well in thy mouth, thou shall
never taste of the heavenly manna. Thy stomach being full of nawghtie humors
thou can never receive the precious food of heaven. Despise from the bottom
of thine heart, all that is delightful here under heaven, And thou shall
easelie make thy soul thereby, to mount above the heavens, and to receive the
joys thereof. Many be desirous to have respect unto both, And giving them
selves unto God, do yet reserve their wordlie commodities still to them
selves. Let it not be grievous unto the, to separate thy self from thy friends
and kynnesfolke when they do give the any impediment toward the way to
heaven, For God reuealeth not his hidden secrettes unto thy soul, in the
presence of other witnesses, neither will he be conuersante with him that is
unquiet, and is occupied about wordlie business.

There is none beloved of the world, but he that is driven away from Christ:
And there is none that is beloved of Christ, but he whom the world despises.
Thou can not perfectly love God but if thou do first despise thy self, and
the world for God: And by this may thou know, whether thou love God, if
thou co^ferre the love that thou bear him, with the love thou bear to the
world: for so much the more as thou love God, so much the less, shall thou
esteem the world.

Our Lord will not have our heart divided, nor parted in pieces, but will have
it whole to him self.

And therefore that thou may not lose a thing of so great a price, esteem but
lightly these tra^sitorie things. And this is the ready way to get the perfect
comfort of spirit.

THAT PERFECT PEACE IS not fovvnd, but of the humble and meek mind, which
is not gotten, but by mortification of our own vvilles and by volu^tarie
suffering of vvordlie pain and tribulation for the love of Christ. CHAP. 2.
I LEAVE unto you peace, Io. 14.
I give you my peace says our Lord: as long as you shall serve the world,
you shall always live in debate and contention. The love of carnal things
is folly, which hinders us of things spiritual. The lovers of the world do
live in continual torment. The world still runnethe about like a wheel, and
in the fury of his turninge, slays them that love it most of all. The true
peace of heart is never obtained by the lovers of this world. Love God and thou
shall have life. Deny thy self and thou shall have the true peace. But who is
he that gets perfect peace in deed? He that is humble and lowly of heart.
Purge thine heart from all malice, and thou shalt have the true and happy
peace. Learn to conquer thy self in every thing, and thou shall have the
inward peace of the mind. Break of thy disordinate appetites: take away thy
vain desires, and drive from thee the insatiable love of the world, and then
shalt thou live at peace and quyetnes. No man shall then trouble the, nothing
shall molest the, but thou shall enjoy the sweetenes of spirit, and find even
Paradise here upon the earth.

Pr. 12.
Nothing can happen unto a just man, that may give him any perturbatio^. Thine
own proper passions be they that make war against thee, And when thine
enemies be within thee, why co^pleinest thou of those that are without thee? A
great Lord is he that can command him self. The dominion of our own will
is of wonderful power and effect, and may do more, the^ all the kings and
Emperors of the earth who can by no means make their enemies their friends as
your will can do being disposed thereunto, in subiectinge our unruly
appetites unto the sweet rule of reason. The vearie cause why injuries,
^duersities, and all kind of other tribu^atio^s annoy thee so much, is because
thou ^oest seek how to fly away from them* and to escape them. Thou
proclaymest open ^arre against them and acco^ptest them for ^hy enemies,
which causes them to ^orke the al thee displeasure they can. But ^f thou
faule in league with them, and ^egynnest once to love them, they that before
did give thee much trouble, will after give thee as much comfort.

Saint Andrew rejoiced in his Cross, and that glorious father Saint Francis
called ^nfirmities his sisters, whereby we may see ^ow these, and other holy
men rejoiced ^n those tribulations which do so much ^ffe^d thee. They loved
that which thou so ^uch hate: And do thou love that which ^hey loved since
it lies in thy power, and ^hou shall the^ find comfort in thy tribulatio^s ^s
they did. If in suffering tribulatio^s thou ^indest the pain grievous unto the,
compleine not of the^ that persequute thee, but ^ather of thy self, who having
free liberty ^n the to love persequutio^, wilt not love it.

Thou must conform thy self to Jesus Christ, and love his Cross and Passion.
Resign thy self wholly to him, and love that wihche he loves and then shall
thou find comfort and sweetenes in those things which now thou take to be
unsavory.

Enter into thy self, and destroy within thee all thy passions and worldly
desires, and thou shall not have cause to co^pleyne against any man. And if any
thing seem^ grievous unto the, make the revenge vp^^ thine enemies within
thee, that do affli^^ thee, and never complain of those enemies which are
without thee, since they cannot hurt thee, but by thine own consent.

Like as the moth bred in the cloth, co^sumeth the self same cloth wherein h^
bre^deth: And in like manner the woorm^ eats up the wood which brought hy^
forth and engendered him: even so these he^^uie cares which so much aggreeue
thyn^ heart, grow in thee of thine own concupiscence. They take their
norishement i^ thee, and at last do consume thee, playeng the vypers with
thee, which eat their way ow^ of their mothers belly which bread them*

Oh in what peace should thou rest, (...) thou were verelie mortefied? True
is the sentence which says: That no man is hu^^ but by him self.

The greatest enemy which thou have i^ thy self. All that is good in thee,
consists in the virtue of thy mind, to which n^ man can do harm,
allthowghe he tak^ away liberty honor, or riches.

And persequutions do not only no^ hurt thee, but also give matter of merit.

Gal. 6.
Now if the glory of a christian, be the cross of Jesus Christ, embrace it,
and the^ shall none trouble thee, nor hurt thee, bu^ thou shall obtain the
true rest and quietness of mind, and live ever after contentedlie and
peaceably.

^Y THE LIFE AND DEATH of our Savior Jesus Christ, it is plainly perceived,
whether the honor and riches of this world ovvght to be esteemed or no, Who
being him self vearie true god, both by his example and doctrine, teaches us
which way they have to take which desire to go the straight and direct
way. CHAP. 3.
BE ye folowers of Jesus Christ as his well-beloved children says the Apostle:
Ephesians. 5.
let all thy labor and study be to conform thy life, to ^he life of our
savior. If we had no other reason for to condemn the vanities of the world
with all, yet the life of Jesus Christ and the example which he gave us here in
earth were sufficient alone to confound all Chistians with all.

It were shame for us to live in pleasure and delight, 2. Reg. 11.
our great captain Ioab li^ing in great danger and ignominy. There is not
any soldier which sees his captain die before his face, but that he will
willingly also put him self to the danger of death forgetting all his former
pleasures and delights. If thou seek for honor when thou see thy Captain
general live altogether without honor, i^ is a great token that thou art
not of his band. And sithence thou reputest thy self for a Christian, thou
may well be asshamed to seek after the love of such vanities as the
infidelles delight in. Many be they which call them selves Christians, but
there be but few of those which follow the life of Christ in deed: in name
they agree all together, but in conversation and behavior they be very far
contrary.

If the lives of many Christians were tried and compared together with the life
of our redeemer, as the woorkema^ tries his work by a line to find out the
crokednes thereof* It would soon appear veary manifest, how much our hearts
were gone away from the true level, in the which God did once rightly settle
us, toward the love of those things which he would have us to despice and
contemn.

Whom think thou to know more? God, or the world? Now if thou think
that God knows more, Behold how he chooses poverty, and a most base kind
of life. And this suffiseth for thee to know how much thy life is out of
square. Thou go clean wide from the true pathe o^ heaven if thou do
disordinatlye seek^ after the honors, and riches of this world.

Mat. 4.
If the world had been good, and the ^onours and riches thereof profitable, our
holy redeemer would never have commanded his disciples to despise them. In
^he little esteemynge of him self, whilst ^e lived here, and in the great
austeritie ^f his own life, our Lord did teach us, ^ow little we ought to
make account of ^hese worldly things.

The hard maunger in which he was ^yed after his holy birth, Luc. 2.
condemns the ^elicatenes of this life of ours. That stawle ^^eweth, how
vain the honors and pro^^erities of this world are. And those sim^le
clothes, wherein his divine majesty ^as wrapped, gyue-vs well to understand
that the riches of this world is.

Proceed thorowghe the whole course ^f his life, and consider also of his
death, and ^^ou shall find, that the soonne of God ^^^er that he became man
did always teach (...) to despise the world, as well by the exa^^^e of his
life, as by the whole course of ^^s doctrine and teachinge.

When he made that great sermon of ^is on the hill he began saying:
Blessed ^e the poor in spirit for theirs is the ^ingdome of heaven.

Our Lord came not into this world ^o undo thee, or to overthrow the, Mat.
5.
but ^o teach thee the way to heaven, and to ^ssure thee of thy salvation. If
Christ erred ^ot, then errest thou: If he chose well, then ^hoosest thou ill:
And if he with disho^our, and by sufferring opened unto thee the gates of
glory, without all doubt thou being such a friend to honor and vanity, do
take the straight way to hell.

In great danger do thou live, and much peril does thy soul run into, y^
thou turnest not back again from the way that thou art now entered into, by
hating o^ that which thou do now so much love* And by determyning to follow
the footesteppes of him that could never err. O^ what an abuse is this, that
a poor simpl^ woorme made of earth will needs be great when the God of all
Majesty was conten^ him self to be so little.

Oh then thou Christian soul if tho^ epsy thy spowse Isaac walkinge on the
ground, thou ought to putt on thy cloak, and cover thee with the veale of
shamefastnes as Rebecca did, Genesis 24.
blusshing for vear^ shame to see thy Lord and Master Jesus Christ to walk
on the earth in the co^te^p^^ of the world, And thy self to sit mownte^
alofte upon thy cammells back in high^ honor and power of the world.

Thou must come down as she di^ despisinge the honor and vanity of thi^
present world, by conforminge thy self to the life of thy redeemer, so as
tho^ may after enjoy with him the true riches and honor which induer for
ever.

THE THINGS OF THIS world allthoughe in appearance they seem good and
delightful, yet are they in deed full of falsehood and vanity, and that for
their instabilitie we ought not to putt any trust in them, lest that in the
general day of judgment we do in vain repent us, that we have loved
more those vanities, then God our Creator. CHAP. 4.
ALL is vanity in this world, Eccl. 1.
and nothing but vanitye is in it says the wise man, I have behoulden says
he, all that is under the soonne, and nothing do I find but vanity. This
world is worthelie called in holy scripture an Ipocrite, because it has an
exterior appearance of goodness, and within, it is full of corruption and
vanity. In deed there appears some show of goodness in these sensible
things, but yet are they but co^uterfeyte and false. Never seek to fasten the
anchor of the shipp of thine heart, in the large Seas of worldly love.

The Reeds when they shoot out first ^n the spring of the year, do with
their fresh green color, delight the eyes for a while, but if thou do break
them, and look within them, thou shall find nothing there but emptines and
holownes.

Let not the world deceive thee, nor thine eyes beguyle thee, by the means
of this vain and counterfett beauty. For truly if thou consider it well, and
look narowlie what is within it, thou shall find there nothing but vanity.
If the world were to be laid open to the eye, And every particular part
thereof vewed and searched out, as the Anotomistes use to do the bodies of
men, yt would soon make an open show of all his vanity. For what soever is
in the world, either it is past, or present, or else to come. That which is
past, is no^ve no longer in being: That which is to come, depends all upon
vncertenties: And that which is present, is but unstable, and to endure but for
a moment. It were great vanity to trust in it, and a much more vanity to
make acco^pte of the favors and love thereof. It is a vanity to desire or
wish for the honors thereof, And a greater vanity to esteem the riches and
pleasures thereof. It is a vanity to love such transitory things: And truly
great vanity to delighte in the corruptible substance of this world. It is
vanity to seek after the wind of human praises: vain be those cares
which cause the to serve so unhappy a master as the world is. Finally all
is but vanity, saving to love and serve God only.

Happy is he which has forgotten the world: such an one may live in vearie
good comfort, when no care may take ^way from him his good spiritual
exercises ^ut may still enjoy the sweetenes and ^eace of the spirit.

It is better to be poor then rich: And ^etter to be little then great: And
better (...) is to be ignorant with humility, then to ^e learned whith pride
and vanity. That ^nowledge and those Good gifts which ^od bestows on thee,
to make thee the ^ore bounde^ to serve him withal fervor ^f heart and
humility: Thou take occasion ^y to be more licentious then other men ^^e,
and more vain and proud.

How much better it is to be little the^ ^^eate, the latter day of all shall
declare in ^^at rigorous and exact judgment, when ^^e books of our
consciences shall be ^^yed all open to the show of all the world: ^ee would then
wish that we had ^^ued god more, and less to have disputed ^f subtle and
curious questions. A pure ^onscience shall then prevail thee more, ^^en thy
profounde and most learned ser^ons that thou have preached. It shall not ^^en
be asked of us what we have said, ^ut what we have done.

It will be more worth at that time to have ^espised the vanity of the world,
then to ^aue followed the deceytfull delights and ^alse promyses thereof.
Better it would be ^t that day, that thou had done penance for thy
sins, then by fullfilling thine appetites here for this short spac^ of time,
be after thrown down to (...) for ever.

Make well thy reckeninge hereof b^ time: Enter whithin thy self, and co^side^
how much of thy life thou have bestowe^ upon the world, And how little thereon
again thou have given to God, which gau^ it thee to serve him wthall. What is
be^come of so many years which are passe^ wthout any proffit at all? what
commodit^ have thou taken of all the time wherei^ thou have served the world?
The tym^ passed can not now be called back again*

The days of thy life do pass away, (...) thou think not thereon, and
death stil^ wayteth on thee. What have thou of al^ that thou have done? In thy
friends tho^ have found no fidelity, In them that tho^ have done good unto,
thou have found in^gratitude. And in the most part of me^ thou have found
falsehood and dissimulati^^ Behold here now, how thou have lost wha^^soeuer
thou have done heretofore. (...) little pleasure that thou haste reaped by the
world, And all that whereof now tho^ do lament thee, do both call and even
(...) unto thee that God is he whom thou onl^ ought to have served and
loved. Tho^ loosest all thy travails and labors whi^^ thou do not bestow
in the only se^^uice of Jesus Christ. That time does onel^ profit the which
thou have spent in his (...), for all the residue is nowghte worth (...) thee:
It is nothing but even a mere ^^nitie.

If thou consider, and do well remem^^^ thee how much time of thy life thou
(...) lost in the pleasinge and contentinge (...) these ungrateful persons
whom thou (...) so much followed, thou must needs ^^epe and lament for that
part of thy life ^^ich is passed, And procure all that thou ^^yest to serve
thy Creator for the (...) that is to come. And that which thou ^^uldest have
wisshed to have done in the (...) passed (which is not to be recoue^^d,)
Endeavor thy self now so to do ^^reafter, that by thy diligent seruinge of
(...) thou may wholly gain the time (...) is to come to be spent only in
his ^^^uice.

It is a great vanity to spend thy time ^^pleasinge of men. Resign up thy
appe^^^es, and do away thine affections, And then thou will esteem as
nothing that which now seems something unto the.

WHOSOEVER WILL KNOW how vain these worldly things are, must not only
consider the b^^gynnyng of them, but way vvith^^ the end of them, which is
allvvay^ accompanied with bitterness and sorov^* CHAP. 5.
Phi. 3.
THere be many which wal^ of whom I toulde you, now do tell you it we^^ping,
which are enemies the Cross of Christ, wh^^ end is destruction saye^ the
Apostle: The end of those that love (...) world (as Saint Paul says) is
death and p^^^ditio^. Do not join thy self in league vn^^ those persons
which the world does (...) unto thee, for thou shall be drawn to fol^^^ the
vanities of their deceiptes. The plea^^^res which it prese^teth unto the, be
the v^^rie messengers of death. Fly from the ^^teringe falsehood thereof, for
fear (...) thou be taken in his snares. Look not (...) that which is present,
but consider withal (...) which is to come. Be diligent in the obs^^^uinge that
which always follows (...) sin: And waying the^ that which is pre^^^ with
that which is to come, thou will fa^^ into a hatred of all the pleasures and
(...) which this world sets before thee, ^llure the with all.

Our lives be as it were Ryuers which (...) run into the Sea of death: The
waters ^^e ryuers are sweet and fresh but the end them is to enter into the
brackishe and ^^er waters of the Sea. Life is a sweet ^^ge to them that do
love it, but when ^^^h does come then will it be bitter. The (...) of those
sweet waters of the River is (...) made bitter by the Sea that it runs
(...) Even so is the end of man's life vearie ^^ernes in deed. The vanities
which (...) worldly folks do delight in withal doubt will end in sorrow
and in ^^^f: They begin in weal, but they (...) end in woe, the entree is
pleasant, but (...) ^oing out is very unpleasant*

^f thou will but consider well, how ^^^e the torment is more then the plea^^^,
thou will willingly renownce all (...) vanities: And the^ shall thou not faule

The common custom of the world is, to give a good dynner first, and an evil
supper afterward. Every one uses to se^ the best wine on the table first,
And af^ter, that which is of the meaner sort: s^ said the Steward of the
Marriage feast a^ Cane in Galile. Ioh. 2.
So is it likewise the common guyse of the world, to begin wit^ joy, and end
with sorrow after. But at the fea^ where Jesus Christ is present him self,
(...) is all contrary, for he gives trouble in the begyninge, and after great
comfort an^ consolation. The pleasant begynninges do^ cover the evil which
is in the world^ which the end does afterward discoue^ When they shall talk

The perfection of any thing is know^ always by the end: Such as the end
i^ such are likewise the things that tho^ delightest in. The end of
pleasures, is to^^ment, The end of much eatinge, is infirmi^tie, And the end
of this life that tho^ delightest so much in, is nothing but woormes and
Ashes. The end and conclusion of every mortal sin, shall be great and
everlasting torment.

WISE MAN OVVGHTE always diligently to consider the end of his actions, to
the intent that knovvinge the filthy end that sin brings with it, he
may well take heed and bevvare thereof. CHAP. 6.
MAN being once in honor and knew it not was compared unto the unreasonable
beasts, Psalm. 48.
and is become like unto the^, says the Prophet David: God gy^^ge unto man
reason and prudence to ^^esee and consider what was after for to ^^ne, and what
end these vanities of the ^^rld did tend unto, he would not take (...)
opportunity and benefit thereof, but ^^ie beheld the present honor he stood
^and did forgett the bitter pain of the partinge therefrome: He remembered
(...) pleasure that he had before his eyes, (...) thought nothing on the pain
that was follow after: yea the pain was even upon ^n before he remembered it, or
aduysed ^n of it. Ecclesiasticus says, I said of (...) sons of men that God
should make ^^ofe of them, Eccle. 3.
and try whether they ^re like unto the beasts, or no. Genes. 3.
God ma^^ Ada^ apparel of the skynnes of beasts after his sin, to declare
thereby vnt^ him, that he was by his fault made lik^ unto them.

The sinner offends God, and as soo^ as he has done, he wishes that he had
ne^uer offended him, since by experience (...) finds how full of malignitie
the world is, and how sorrow is still joined unto plea^sure, But why considered
he not this before he sinned?

It is the property of a wyseman to con^sider things in the beginning, And
of fool to advise him self when it is to la^^ A wise man bethinketh him
first, but t^^ fool says: I thought not thereon at all. (...) thou would
think beforehande of t^^ unpleasant end which these world^^ things do
bring with them, thou shou^^dest have no cause of repentance after. T^^ Prophet
David says. Psalm. 118.
I thought upon (...) ways, and I returned back from the w^^ that I was
walkinge in* Of the thinkin^ of the end of sin, grows the desire^ forsake
sin, and to return again to kee^ the commandments of God.

If thou should pass by a way* the which it had been toulde the before
that thieves and murderers did haunt, wo^^dest thou not forsake thine intended
w^ and take some other? In the way of the pleasures which now thou art entered
in there be thieves which seek to dest^^ the grace of God in thee, and to take
awa^ from thee thy means of meriting: Take (...) ^ouncell with thee, and turn
the back ^gayne if thou will escape death. As Soon ^s temptation begins to
assail thee, co^^ider the way that it leads the unto, And ^f thou occupyest
thine understanding ^ell in the remembringe thereof, I doubt ^ot, but that
thou will soon turn back ^gayne.

The Apostle says, Romans 6. Gene. 25.
That the reward of ^^nne is death. Jacob and Esau, were in their ^^others
womb together, and contended ^^gether which of them should come ^^rth first,
and when they were borne Ia^^b took Esau by the sole of the foot. ^he head is
the first and principal part (...) man, and the foot is the last and
extre^est part of all the whole man. And this (...) the difference betwixt
evil men and ^^od: The good do take vice by the foot and the wicked take it
by the head. The ^icked embrace all kind of pleasures, ^^nours and vanities,
And look not toward ^^e end of these matters: But the good ^^ke the world by
the foot, and do con^^^er the bitter end of all these pleasures.

The pleasures and prosperities of this ^orlde, do shine brighte like a
burninge ^^ndle, whilst the flame thereof does (...), but when the substance
thereof is wasted, ^endeth with a smoke and an evil sa^^ur. And even so do all
these worldly ^^^asures end. And allthowgh the shynyng ^his vanity does now
for a time de^^^t thee, yet deceive not thy self, for in the end it will
breed thee great affliction and much remorse of mind.

In the Psalm it is written, As the smok^ co^sumeth, Psalm. 67.
so do all sinners vannysh away from the face of God, And as wax co^sumeth at
the fire so do sinners consume and perish in the presence of God. If thou be
wise tho^ wilt provide for that which is to come.

That which has been, is an instruction of that which is to come. Remember
sayt^ the Apostle, Romans 6.
the things that are passed, (...) consider thereby what is to follow after
what proffit (says he,) have thou reape^ of all those things wheroof thou art
no^ ashamed? Reduce in to thy memory ho^ unfruitful the time which thou have
spe^^ in the world has been unto thee. An^ look thou return not again to
thy fo^^mer follies. Allthoughe thou do live i^ the greatest glory of the
world, y^^ think that it must soon have an end. The vain must those
worldly pleasures (...) which have so vain an end.

Psalm 77.
The Prophet David says, They h^^ yet in their mouths, their meat, and the
anger of God fell down upon the^* These worldly men likewise begynne^ sooner
to taste of the vain pleasures (...) this life, but the Justice of God does
co^^ upon them, and chastise them for th^^ sins. And since that affliction is
thus io^^ned to all worldly things, consider (...) end in the beginning: and
forsake the vanities thereof betymes.

HOW MAN OVVHGT NOT to much to be aggreeued when men do murmr against
him: Nor rejoice ouermuche of praises that be given unto him, for before the
face of God, the judgments of men do neither hurt, nor good. CHAP. 7.
CAST thy care upon God (says the prophet) and he will reeleue the. Psalm. 54*
Let all thy care be to please God, and the^ thou shall not be lifted up with
the vain praises ^f men, nor beaten down or troubled ^hen they speak evil
of the.

The occasion why their evil speeches ^oe offend the, is because thou
pretendest ^ith thy self to please and content them. and the cause for which
their praises do (...) much delight the, is for that thou desi^est to have
them maintain a good opi^ion of the. Oh that thou would desire ^ought else
but to please God, and to fulfill ^^s holy will, and then should all things
^oe well with the: Oh how little account ^ouldest thou then make of these
words ^hiche do now so much work with in ^ee. Labor to content none, but
him alone, and then shall thou live quiet and contented. Nothing shall then
offend the, but that which shall offend him, nor any thing delighte the, but
that which delights him, And so shall thou be comforted contynuallie in
purity of conscience.

It is mere vanity for the to make account of the fond and rash
judgments of men, if it stand well between God and the.

There have been many which the world has made vearie much of, who now do
lie full low in hell, And diverse other there are, which have been taken for
fools, that do enjoy the everlasting glory of heaven. And since it is thus,
never take thou any glory in the praise of men, allthoughe they commend the
never so much, neither do thou despair or mistrust thy self for any evil
opinion the world has of thee. If they commend thee worthelie for that good
which is in thee be not thou proud thereof, for if they saw such secret
defectes in thee, as thou find in thy self, they would commend the^ nothing
at all. And if they do praise the^ for these virtues which thou haste not
procure to have the^, that the world be no^ deceived in the. And if they have
caus^ in truth to murmr against thee, seek^ thou to amend thy self. And if
they iudg^ amiss of the, thou must remember th^^ they are but men, and that
much harm^ they cannot do the, but rather some goo^ if thou have patience
withal. If Almighty God would ask the opinion of men, and have a
consultacion with them, before he either call thee to heaven, or condemn the
to hell, It were good policy then for thee to currie favor with them, and
seek to be esteemed for a vearie Saint amongst them: But since he will have
^he alone face to face before him, And thy soul and he shall enter into
account together of all matters, it is but vearie vani^ie, to make account of
the judgments ^f men, and to desire to have their praises, ^or God means
not to take their opi^io^ in the matter, neither shall any question ^e asked
them of the, for they have no ^oyce therein at all. And allthoughe they ^ake
their pleasures in talkinge of the, yet ^s not God directed by their sayings,
but ^y that vhich he shall find in thine own ^onscience. What would it
avail thee before God, if all the world should say ^hou were a Saint, and
deseruedest glo^ie, And God him self that is only to judge thee, does find
the with a spotted ^o^science? And likewise if all the world should condemn
the, if thou be found to ^e gods friend, what can their reproba^^o^ do the
harm? Not he whom they re^roue is reproved before God, nor all that ^^ey do
allow is accepted before God.

Their judgments be vain, they know ^ot the hearts nor the deserts of me^:
They ^^n not enter into the soul of man, and therefore they are most co^menlie
deceived. They them selves give not grace, and therefore they can give no
glory, neither rests it in their power either to condemn the, or to save
the. And if all the men in the world were thy friends, they shall never be
able to prolonge thy life for one hour, no more shall they be able to deliver
thee from the rigorous judgments of God.

Oh how much better will it be for the in the hour of thy death to have God
for thy friend, then to spend thy whole life in seekinge to please the kings
and Princes of the earth, who though they do love the never so much, shall
not a^ that time be able to do any thing for the.

This council will I here give the. Do not take any grief, if in doing thy
duty the world does murmr against the, neither take thou any pain to
please the world, to win thereby their praise again, for all this is but
vanity and loss of time. But rather lift up thine heart to God, and with all
thy force procure to please and to content him alone, and shu^ up all thy
senses from hearing and harkeninge after the vain blastes of this unhappy
world.

SINCE EVERY ONE OF US must be judged by God him self, who is the only
searcher of hearts: we ought not to make any reckenynge of men's words, but
labor to have a clear conscience before him. CHAP. 8.
I MAKE but small account to be judged of you, 1* Cor. 4.
says Saint Paul, for he that must judge me is God him self. Judge not
before the time, until our Lord do come, who will lighte^ the secrettes that
are hidden in darkness, and will make manifest ^he inward part of our hearts,
and then shall every one receive his praise at gods hand: This said Saint
Paul in the contemnynge of the sayings and opinions of men. God knows the
hearts, and sees what every one is. At the hour of death it will appear,
who is good, and who is evil: we need not care for the judgments of men,
Let us seek how to please God one^y. Those which do run at Tilte to break
their staves, do make no acco^pte of the praise or disprayse of the ignorante
peoples judgments, which do look on: They respect only the judgment of
those which are to give the pryces to the best runner: Even so ought thou
to neclecte the praise or disprayse of men, and only seek to have all thy
care in pleasinge of God that must judge thee. If thou do travail and take
pain here, i^ is he which sees all, and of his own hand shalt thou receive
thy reward. Love thou the verity, and not the sayings of men, who are for the
most part moved either with love or with hatred, not considering what is in man
worthy either to be loved or mislyked. Be not thou trowbled, nor take any
grief thereof at all, that some folk have of thee an evil opinion.

Art thou better then Jesus Christ* Read in the Gospel and thou shall find
that some called him a deceauer of the people, Math. 27. John. 8.
some a Samaritane, and one that was possessed with the devil. Some said that
he was not a man of God, since that he kept not the feast days: Other answered
again, how could he do so many miracles being a sinner? John. 5.
In so much that S. John says. There was there-vppon a great scisme and
division amongst them. Now if of our Savior him self, who was all holiness,
and goodness, there were so many opinions of men, why art thou so proud, that
heing so full of so many and sundry kinds of imperfectio^s, would yet that
every one should allow of thy doings and commend thee. If of our most
innocent Lord there were so many thoughts (...) men, why would thou, that
all men should sound forth thy praises with one ^^outh? If thou being a
vessel full of all ^^etchednes and iniquity art yet of many ^^mmended, let
it not displease thee, or ^^eeue thee, that there be some again which speak
little good of thee.

There is not any so good, or so holy (...) this world, whose life is of all
men ^^mmended, neither is there any man's ^^^orke so well justified, but that
the ^^cked will mumure at it. It were a foul ^^our, not to use virtue in
respect of any ^^^nge that the world can say against it. ^t thy life be never
so holy, there will ^^t want some, which will speak against (...)* And if
thou be so light as to be moved ^^th all that men say of thee, thou shall
^^uer do any work that good is.

The poor blind man that sat by the ^^ye side at Iherico calling upon Jesus
^^rist to help him, Luc 18.
wanted not some that ^unde fault with him: But he the more ^^ey found fault
with him, the more he ^^rseuered in cawlinge upon him. It is ^^possible to
refrain the tongues of the ^^cked and the malignante people.

Draw thou near unto God and follow ^^e way of virtue, and co^tynue in it when
^^ou have begone it, not making any ac^^mpte of the words of idle fellows,
which have no other business, but to gloss ^^on other men's intentions, and to
inter^^ete amiss of their neighbors doings, It were a ready way for thee
to mak^ thee to loose thy wits if thou shoulde^^ give ear and make account
of all tha^ the people talks: Endeavor thy self contynuallie to please God,
and to fullfi^^ his will, for all the rest is but vanity an^ affliction of
mind.

LET EVERY ONE LABOV^ to do good only to please God vvit^ all, and not for
the desire of vvorldli^ praise, if he look to be revvarded for his well
doing. CHAP. 9.
Mat 6.
BEVVARE that you do no^ your works (says ou^ Lord) to the intent to be
seen of me^. And allthough^ our Savior says likewise in another place: Let
you^ light so shine before men, Mat. 5.
that they may^ see your good works, yet was it not hi^ will for all that we
should seek ou^ own praise, but the glory and honor of God, And therefore
he added sayinge^ to the intent that they may glorify you^ father which is in
heaven. He that does (...) good work because he would be pray^sed for the
doing of it, seeks not go^^ ^lorie, but his own.

God does not prohibit us to do good ^penlie, but he would that our intention
^houlde be secret. He commands thee ^ot to seek thine own praise, but in
the ^ood which thou shall do, to seek to ^lease him.

If thou commit the treasour of thy ^oorkes to an other man's mouth, It is the^
^o longer in thine own power either to ^eepe it, or to loose it. Keep thine
own ^easour thy self, and hyde priuelie the ^^ches of thy virtues, unless
thou will let ^^atterers spoil thee quyte of them.

King Ezechias, because he showed his ^^easure to the Embassatours of the
king ^f Babylon, 4. Reg. 20
he was greuouslie punished therefore. Do not publishe abroad thy ^ood works
which thou do, lest ^hou be punnished by God for a vain and (...) arrogant
person. Seek not for the re^ard of thy well woorking in this world, ^est thou
loose thereby thy reward in ^eauen, and that the Judge do say unto ^hee at
the judgment day. Thou have re^eyued thy reward all ready. Mat. 6.


Be not thou desirours to be justified ^y men, for if thine own conscience do
^ccuse the, what avails thee then their ^ayne praises. Fly from being
praised, ^est thou be deceived, And so loose the ^erite of thy good work.

Let not the praises of men, nor the fa^ours of those which are mighty, any
thing move thee, or delight thee, for all such things as do separate thee
from the cheifest felicity of all, be both vearie vain* and very dangerous.

Of words make thou no account at all, for wysemen way more thy works them
thy words. A good work is praise worthy of it self, and they that seek
after words, shall nothing find at the last. The virtue that is wroughte in
God shall receive reward at the hand of God. If thou will commit thy life unto
the mouths of me^, thou shall never be quiet nor at rest amongst them, for
sometime thou shall be of good account amongst them, and some time again
thou shall be no body, as their fancies serve them. The good and just man is
not moved with fair words but seeks all that he can to please God alone.

Return and look into thine own conscience, where thou shalt find recorded
the vearie truth of that which thou art in deed. There shall thou find, how
thou art a weak and a frail sinner, And that thou have not long to live
here. And when death in deed shall come, then shall thou see how vain the
glory of this world is, how brittle is the joy, And how little worth the
praises of men are. Desire not to be in the mowthes of men, for that they do
easelie deceive with their vain praises, the greedy and fond folowers of
this worldly honor.

It is but a vain delighte which is not founded upon a pure and a clean
conscience. As goulde is tried in the furnace, so is man tried in the mowth of
him that prayseth him. Prou. 27.
The gould is pourged in the furnace, and that which is not gould turns into
smoke and sinders: So virtue being once passed throwghe the furnace of praise,
if it be false it consumes away to nothing, but if it be true, it is by
praise increased. If thou desire the praise of men, thou have not true virtue
in thee. If thou do exalt thy self by man's praises, thou art not surely
virtuous.

Those of Babilone when they hard once the music sound, Dan. 3.
they adored the Idol, and so do vearie many men, hearing them selves once
praised, they fall after to the adoringe of the Idol of vice.

The Manna which the Israelites did reserve for any of the week days, Exo. 16.
they found it always the next day following to be eaten up with worms, But
that which was kept for the saboth day, remained sound and incorrupte. By
this is to be understood, That by the week days is signified the time of this
present life, And all the works that thou do in this world to be praised
therefore of men, are all marred and corrupted: But those which thou do lay
up in store for the great feast of the glorious Saboth in heaven, will continue
good and sound for thee there* for the which also thou shall receive reward.
Lay therefore all thy works up in store against that high feast of glory.

When God commanded that the stones of which the Aulters were made, Exo. 20.
should not be pollished nor wrought, but should remain rude and without
woorkemanship, he meant thereby no other thing, but that the works which we
should do, we should not do them to be esteemed for them by man, but only
by the doing of them to please God.

The stone is not wroughte on the owte side but only to make it fair to the
show and view of men. Beware therefore of seekinge to please those that do
stand by to look o^. Seek thou only to please God, and to serve him in the
inward part of thine heart, And defye all vain Hypocrisy, or any other thing
that should make thee to esteeeme of the vain praises of men.

HOW GREAT A SIN vaynglorie is, and of how much mischief that is the
cause: And how carefully they ought to avoid it, that do tend to the
perfection of Chistian Religion. CHAP. 10.
GYVE unto thy Lord God the glory (says the scripture: Ios. 7.
) The glory of thy good works God him self does crave at thy hand, as the
principal author and cause of the good which thou do. Beware that thou
vsurpest not that glory unto thy self, which God will not give unto any man.
Vain glory is a great offense unto God: And self love is a very hurtefull
thing unto the spiritual man.

In every thing that thou do, beware of vain glory, and fly from it as
from a Cockatrice, who if he chance for to espy thee, before thou espy him,
and so be taken unprovided, with his very sight will cause thee to dye: But if
thou espy him first, and do consider well what vanity is, and how little
reason thou have to take glory of thine own doings, thou shall get perfect
victory thereof.

Let God be praised in his works and not man, who is but a poor instrument
of his grace. Esa. 10.
Will happily the axe (says God) vaunte it self against him that cutteth
therewithal: Or will the saw rise up against him that works therewith. The
praise of the work is not to be attributed to the instrumente, but unto him
that works with it. Now if thou do any good work, thou art nothing else
but the instrumente which God works it by. Beware lest thou do attribute
unto thy self* that honor and glory which is due unto thy Lord. Exo. 10.


The Apostle after he had made mention of many afflictions which he had
suffered in doing his duty to God, says. It is not I which have done it, 1
Cor. 15.
but the grace of God which is with me.

Apoc. 4.
The four and twenty elders mentioned in the Apocalips took of the crowns
from their heddes, and laid them at the feet of the Lamb. So ought thou
to do also, laying the honor of thy good works at the feet of Jesus Christ,
remembringe what the Prophet says: Psalm. 113. Esa. 25.
Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. All our works
thou have wrought in us O Lord, says Esaias.

Samson glorying in a victory which ^od gave unto him said: Iu. 15.

Moses thowght that his hand had been ^^ole and sound, Exo. 4.
but as soon as he put (...) hand into his bosom, it came out ^^ayne all
full of leprosy. If thou do ^^inke that thy works be good and soun^^* do
but put thy hand into thy bosom, ^^d lay it on thine heart, consideringe with
(...) self what circunstances are required (...) make every work to be good
and ^^rfect, And thou shall happily find that ^^ey be partly taynted with
some spice (...) the leprosy of vain glory* what have (...) that thou have
not received of God? Thy perdition is of thy self, Oze. 13.
but thy sal^^^io^ is from god. If thou do look what (...) passed thee
before time, thou will ^^de that thou have committed some thing ^^t thou may
worthelie be asshamed of. If thou have consideration to that which is now
present, Thou shall find thy sel^ in this time of bannyshement enuiron^^ with
infinite dangers: And if thou (...) thine eyes to that which is to come, th^^
have much to be affrayed of, considerin^ the terrible Judgments of God which
are toward thee.

Thou ought rather to walk in fe^^ and dislykinge of thy self, here in
the vale of misery and tears, Then be ful^ with vain glory and likinge of
thy sel^ since those good works which th^^ do, thou know not how
acceptab^^ to God they be, neither yet how lon^ thou shalt persevere in them.
He that sta^^deth, 1. Cor. 10

If thou take vain glory of that gra^^ which God gives thee, and be prow^^

Pr^^phet says further. Psalm. 29.
Thou have turned (...) face away from me, and straight wayes^ was troubled.
If thou do any good (...) all, thou do it by the power of God, (...) what

If the Angels which have so high a ^^gnitie in heaven, do seek nothing

Learn ^^ou (O miserable man) to be humble of heart, (...) thou may find that

^HE CONSIDERATION OF thine own weakness and defectes, and the great

out of that which is eui^ So contrariwyse the malice of our adue^^sarie the
devil, is so great, that of good (...) gathers evil. Out of good works
(...) gathers vaynglorie, to the end that (...) may destroy the merit of

proceeds from (...) light of our good works, from the whi^^ the Prophet
desired to be delivered. Psalm. 90.
(...) heed thou be not hit with this arrow which carries poison with it to
slaye th^^ with all.

When thou think that thou ha^^ done enowghe, and well acquitted thy sel^^
in thy woorkinge, it is because thou (...) not compared thy works, with the
work^^ of holy men. It thou compare thine ow^^ works with theirs, thine own
will a^peare to be but of little value. A thin^ which seems to be white when
it is c^^^pared with snow, seems in manner (...) black. If thou call to thy
remembran^^ how much the holy Martirs suffered, (...) the great penance they
took, I know not what work of thine, that were ther^ (...) compared, would
seem any other (...) very vain and unprofitable: Know ^^ne own weakness,
and how little thou ^^^e, and be not proud of nothing: let not ^^itie move thee
to do any work, ney^^er the hoping for any reward of man.

The wyndemill goes not about, nor ^^ndeth meal, but if it have wind to

but ^he wind of vanity do blow them ^^warde to yt: But the merit of thy
^^d work is lost, if thou be moved ^^^reunto by vanity. What if thou
fulfill (...) that the law commands thee, where^^^^ have thou yet to
glory? our Lord saying ^^^o thee, Luc. 17.
when ye have done all that is ^^^maunded you, yet say that you be still
^^profitable servants.

All though that thou had always ^^ued God, yet owghtest thou to account
(...) self but unprofitable still. How much ^^re then ought thou so to do,
if thou ^^est cawle well to thy remembrance all ^^^t thou have done before, and
how many ^^^es thou have fallen into sin. The way (...) thee to do all
things in deed, is to ^^ke account with thy self that thou ^^^t yet done
nothing.

Destroy not the fruit of thine own ^^uailles, neither let al thy labors be
lost (...) nothing. God knows better then thy ^^^e, what thou do, and what
thy merits (...): he will not leave unrewarded one cup of could water
which thou h^^ given in his name.

What need is it for thee the^ praise thy self? Do not thou kno^ that if
thou praise thy self, thou shall (...) be praised of God? Esteem thy self
(...) unprofitable, and God will account the amongst those that he allows
for go^^ and profitable. If thou were never (...) much worthy of praise before,
yet as^^ thou have entered into the praising of (...) self, thou have lost all
that thou didd^^^ deserve before. And if thou were before unprofitable, yet in
so humbling of (...) self, and acknowledging thy self for ^^profitable, thou
shalt be accounted (...) profitable. It is necessary for thee to ^^ther thy
thoughts together: It is con^^nient for ^hee to forget thine own ve^tuous
deeds, since thou have forgo^ thy sins which much better deseru^
remembrance at thy hands. It is (...) most necessary thing for thee to (...)
thy good works. The good holy (...) old time, labored much to bring to (...)
memory their offenses past, and for (...) purpose they humbled them selves
ver^ much.

The Pharisee throwghe vain glo^^ was over thrown, Luke. 18
allthowgh it seem^^ tha^ he gave God thanks. If thou (...) praise thy self,
thou art abominable ^^fore god, and hateful in the sight of m^^* If thou will have thy deeds to be gre^^ ^^^eede yet take not thou them for such (...)

^^VV LITTLE A MAN OVVGHT ^o esteem him self for great in this world,
asvvell because that being in that state, he is in more danger of favvlinge
into sin: As also for that ^he most part of men, throvvghe the ^pinio^ of
their own greatenes, forsake clean the seruinge of God. CHAP. 12.
SEEK not to clyme to high, Romans 11.
(says the Apostle:) but fear least by going to high, thou fawle down
again. If thou will great in heaven, thou must be but little ^e upon the earth.

Thou have known many both great (...) mighty, of whom there is now no
me^rie lest at all. How many have attay^^^ unto great dignities and stately
pro^^^tions, which when they have enjoyed ^^m a while with great pomp and
glo^^, all that glory turned quickly to a smoke, and within a short space
after (...) mention at all was made of them, nor (...) taken for them. They are
gone and o^^^ succeed in their rooms, who little este^^ of those that went
before them.

Why do thou labor to co^mau^^ and to be great? Why will thou be a mig^^
man in this world? In the state which (...) desire to be in, have their not
been (...) other before thee? Has not the wo^^ clean forgotten them, and do
not (...) see also what is become of them? And (...) like that is to them
befallen, must tho^ so look to befall unto thy self, since (...) world
keeps still his old custom. (...) houlde how they ascended up, and ho^ they
fell down again, and thou she find, that the more glorious their asc^^^dinge
was, the more shameful was (...) fall.

Those persons, whom some of the great men in former times disday^ do now
walk over them, and tread the under their feet.

Thou may think, that in the s^^ state in which thou wishedst to be, o^^
were before, whose names thou kno^ not: and the world has now forgo^ that
ever there were any such, they b^^ turned into dust and ashes. Think no^ much
of that which is present, but lo^^ to that which is to come. Make no^ much
account of that honor which (...) world does offer unto thee here, but lo^^
that is to follow after. If thou will but ^^nsider, and set before thine eyes,
that ^^ich shall follow after this short life is ^^ste, thou will be right
well contented ^^th the state in which God has now ^^aced thee here.

Let not the world beguyle thee, neither (...) the devil make thee to believe
that ^^ou would have served God better (...) some higher room, then in that
mean ^^lling, wherein he has now placed thee.

Many a simple soul does our enemy, ^^e devil deceive, with making them (...)
believe such like lies and vanities, under ^^e color of virtue. They desire
aduaun^^mentes and great preferme^tes supposing ^^en that they would give
large alms, and ^^e many other good deeds. But all this (...) false and full
of disceyte: for honors and ^^omotions do blind us worldly folk ^^e
greatest men, be lest lords of them ^^^ues, and in the greater dignity that
men ^^ue, the more are they chardged with ^^re both of them selves and of
others ^^so.

And now that thou art free from that ^ardge, and thereby more Lord and ^^ster
of thy self, and yet do not satisfy ^^at little which thou art bownde
unto, ^^w would thou satisfy that great ^ardge, being in less freedom
and liber^^. If thou can not welde well a small ca^^^ge, how would thou
do, with an hea^^ burden? If a few cares do keep thee from thy prayers and
other spiritual exer^cises, how will thou do, when thou art en^uironed with
many cares.

He that cannot bear a little, how w^^^ he go throwghe with much? He that
(...) not a good Subject, will never be good go^uernour. Be thou the seruante
of God, an^ love him, and see that thy conscience b^ clear, and refer all
the rest to God, for y^^ he have ordained thee to be great, he ca^ set thee up
when he list, without any ca^^ of thine, for of thy diligence therein, h^ has
no need at all. Be thou humble be^fore the face of God and care not for these
dreams of honors. The trees which grow in highest places, be soonest blow^
down with the wind. Esteem not the highest degrees, for there is least
safety* In fishers nets the greatest fish be taken when the small fish
escape through the (...) at ease. 4. Reg. 25.
The greatest princes and cheef^ persons of Jerusalem, were led capti^^ into
Babylon by Nabuchodonozer wh^^ he took the town, but the meanest sor^ of
people were suffered to continue sti^^ in their country and dwelling place.
D^^sire not to be great, since thou shoulde^^ thereby be so much the more
likely to (...) a pray unto the devil. Have thou no lo^^ginge to be a mighty
man in this world lest thou be brought to the eternal co^^fusion of Babylon.

Consider the end that great men ha^^ comme unto and thou will like well (...)
^^ugh to continue in the mean state thou ^^e now in. Be contented with the
state ^^ich God has putt thee in, that thou ^aiest merit after this short
life, an high ^owne of everlasting glory.

^HE GREAT BOND THAT great men are in, and that it is much better for our
sovvles, that we be subjects, then governors, because they have to render
account of the sovvles ^^mmyted to their chardge. CHAP. 13.
YE Know not what ye ask, said our Lord to his two disciples that would be
preferred before their fellows. Mat. 20. Mar. 10.
The not knowing ^^o thou art, breeds the appetite and ^^sire of commanding
and being great (...) the world.

Honor is the reward of virtue: if thou ^^e take thy self for worthy of that
re^^rde, and think thy self to be good, ^^en for that cause only art thou
vnwor^^e of any honor at all. The very opi^^on of thinkinge thy self to be a
good ^^^n, is enoughe to make thee know that ^^ou art none. If thou do but
believe that thou deseruest it, even for that alon^ may thou know that thou
deseruest^ not: For ambition is the mother of all fa^^sehood and heresy.

It is hard to be in a high degree, and n^^ to have a proud and a high
mind. Ther^^fore do thou put thy self into great danger in seekng to be
set a lofte in the world, and to command other. And ^ think verelye that
there is none of^ small understanding, that would be a rul^ of other, if he
considered well with all, the chardge and the burden of those that bea^^ rule
and authority. They that would (...) in authority know not suerlie what
b^^longeth to them that be in authority.

The governor ought so much to (...) cell all those whom he governs, as the
shepeherd ought to excel his sheep.

The degree of a doctor is not bes^^^wed upon him that begins for to b^^^
student, because he has an intent to (...) learned, but upon him that is
allrea^^ well studied. Neither is he to be mad^ governor, that begins to be
vertuo^^ but he that has of long time ruled w^^ his appetites and is
allreadie virtuous.

Government belongs to those wh^^ are perfect.

Number. 10.
God commanded that at the first bl^^^ of the trumpet, the Captains should
(...) comme into the field: And after the bl^^^ thereof should have begone to
sow^ again, the whole Number of the peop^^ should have followed after. But the
princi^^ll leaders, must ever be ready at the first ^^ll to do God his
service. The subjects ^^e not bound so far forth, as the rulers, because
they are not in equal degree of ^erfection. But God will that the rulers be
(...) diligent in their chardge, that they ^^old be ready to run at the vearie
first ^allinge.

Hou much thou go before others in ^ignitie of calling, so much must thou
^^kewise go before them in virtuous life. ^f thou have received much, thou
must ^unswere for much. If thou do sin, thy ^^nne is more grievous, and thy
fawl^ must ^^e greater, in as much as thy calling is greater.

All Christ's disciples were a sleep together in the gardeyn, Mat. 26.
but our Savior ^eprehended none for his sleping but S. ^eter alone, for
though they were all ^ulpable of the same crime, yet did the ^heefe of them
all, deserve the greatest ^lame.

He that is to keep others from sleepinge, ^s bound to much watching him
self.

Thou will not be ambitious, if thou consider that thou art bound to be more
virtuous then others, and that if thou ^oest sin, thou must have also more
pun^isheme^te then others have. All men's eyes ^e fixed upon him that is in
authority, and ^f he do not that which he ought to do, ^e does give cause of
scandal and offense unto many.

The evil ruler is worthy of as ma^^ deaths, as he has given occasion of
much synninge to the weak throwghe his eui^^ examp^e. The children of Job
perishe^ all in the house of their eldest brother: Job. 1.
S^ do the subjects perish by the example o^ their governor, who is to them
as it we^re their elder brother. For comonlie the subjects do always follow
the exampl^ of their leaders.

According to the colored sticks which the shepeherd Jacob pitched in the
wate^ where his sheep did drink, Gene. 30.
did they con^ceyue and bring forth their lambs. S^ likewse according to such
examples, as the subjects do see in their superiors do^ they conceive and
bring forth good o^ euil^ works. It is a blot in the subjects (...) to behold
an evil example in his ruler. The good or evil deeds, which art a directo^^
of others be like unto the colored wa^de^^ which Jacob set up before his sheep:
looke^ how thou live, even so will they live also*

When the Pillar which went before the children of Israel for to guide the^
and lead them the way did go, Exodus 13.
the people followed, and went after yt. And when it stood still, the people
stood still also* So likewise, when the governor leads his folowers by the
way of virtue, they walk after him the same trade, but if he stand still, and
do live in Idleness, the subjects stand still, and will not set on^ ^^ote
forward toward any good virtue* ^^oe thou before them thy self, that have
^^ardge of them if thou will have them (...) proff^^ by thee, for if thou do
stand ^^ll, and call on them to go forward ^^ey will little regard thy
words.

There is much more force in perswa^^nge by works and examples, then by
^^ordes: if thou will have thy people to ^^e well, begin to do well thy self
before them. The Physician does more move ^^s patient to drink his bitter
medecyne, (...) drinkinge part of yt before his face, ^^en by his only
word, in willinge him (...) drink of yt.

So shall thou move thy people more (...) do well, if thou go before them,
^^d say unto them, let us go on together, ^^en in willing them to go on, and
stand ^^y self still.

Saint Luke in the acts of the Apostles, ^^yth of our Lord: Act. 1.
That he began first to ^^e, and after to teach. Never trouble thy ^^lfe with
much speakinge, which does no ^^od when thou thy self live lice^tiouslie ^^e
while, for it is a monstrous thing for a ^^an to have his tongue larger the^
his hand.

Thy tongue is less then thy hand, and ^^osed up in thy mouth, because it is
gods ^^ill that thou should use but few wor^^es, and many deeds: speak
little and ^^oe much.

The great rulers of these our days, and ^^e great preachers also make
great account of their well speakinge, and bu^ vearie little reckening make
they, of the^^ virtuous lyuinge.

And when their living is misliked their doctrine is but little esteemed. Be
thou the first that shall use diligent service toward God, And thou shall soon
perceive how much thou shall move the subjects more by thy good examples, th^^
by all thy fine talkinge and fair words* It is a great folly suerlie, to
have a desir^ to be over other in authority, when tho^ art bound to give a
reckening to God o^ their sowles. It will be great trouble to the to be asked a
reckenynge of thy subiecte^ sins, which thy self never committed.

It is a madness for one man to be bound to pay for that which an other man
de^uoureth. When the day of iudgeme^^ comes, it will be work enough for
eue^^ man to answer for his own soul without any further acco^pte giving for
the soule^ of other men. If thou shall the^ find enoug^ to do for to deliver
thine own soul* how much more shall thou have to do (...) answer for the
consciences of other men^ and to deliver their souls. It is suerlie gre^^
vanity for thee to put thine own salvation into so great a danger.

And much greater vanity is it for th^^ to desire to be greater here in this
place (...) bannisheme^t, and exile, then other men (...)

If thou be virtuous, and do (...) which thou ought to do, thou shall
(...) better beloved, and more honored of (...), allthoughe thou be but a
subject, then ^^u shall be if thou be taken and esteemed (...) a proud and an
high minded ruler.

Do away thine affections, and put (...) thy mind all such vain thoughts.
^he humility as becomes the faithful ^^ante of Jesus Christ, and drive from
^^ne heart the love of worldly honour^ (...) promotio^s, for at the hour of
death, ^^ich can not be vearie long to, since our (...) is so short,) these
things can nothing ^^her thee, but rather putt thy salvation (...) greater
danger.

^^NSIDERINGE HOW ^ITTLE ^ime we have to tarry in this world, we ought
not to sent our love upon any of these worldly things, but have ^ur eye
fi^ed still tovvard heaven, for ^he which we were created, and so ^ughte
we to use these worldly ^hinges in this our Pilgrimage* as we ^ay gain
by them the things celestial. CHAP. 14.
VVHILEST we do here live in this world we are in Pilgrimage and journey
toward our Lord, 2 Cor. 5.
says the Apostle: Remember that (...) art here in this life a stranger, and
goinge onwarde thy way toward heau^^ We have here no certain resting pla^^
but we look for that which is to co^^* Heb. 13.
There is no journey made without ^^uayle. And since thou art here a trauayle^
and a wayfaring man, thou must not loo^ to spend the time thou lyuest here in
(...) and pastyme.

Make not much ado in building (...) howses to make a long abode here in (...)
barrayne world, since thou have so ry^^ and so plentiful a country prepared
(...) thee by thy father in heaven, make the^^^fore what have thither thou
can.

Hear what S. Peter says unto you^ desire you all that live here like
stra^^gers and pilgrims, 1. Pet. 2.
that you will abstay^^ from all carnal and sensual delights, a^^ live ye as
it becomes pilgrims to d^* You know how that pilgrims and passe^^gers here in
this world do lead a life (...) of pain and travail: They are all (...) were
strangers, and live void of (...) friends here. Make thou therefore no
^^^compte of worldly frenshippe, since th^^ know that it is hurtful to the
soul* (...) since thou art but a trauayler here, th^^ must not look to have
all things acc^^^ding to thine own taste. If thou carry (...) well this in
mind, that thou art (...) a pilgrim, thou shalt thereby esc^^^ (...)
mischeefes.

Thou must pass away in haste (...) post through this world, and make (...)
taryeng here.

He that takes up his lodging at ad^enture in an Inn to stay there but an
^owre or two, never goes about to dress ^p the house, nor to bestow any cost
there, ^eaning not to rest therein, but makes ^ccompt to get him quickly
thence: And ^f he should do otherwise, men would ^ccompt him but a fool for
his labor. ^hou art here but a pilgrim, to day thou ^mest hither, to morrow
thou must make ^ccompte to be gone again.

Never take thou any care to get ho^ours, riches, or other like vanities, since
^^ou art like no longer to enjoy them, ^ut part thou must from them again in
^^eate have: but rather play the good way^ring man's part, who all the way that
he ^auayleth, has still his mind on his iour^^es end, and the place unto
which he (...) going. So let all thy thoughts and cogi^^tions be altogether of
heaven, which is ^e very true land of the living, where christ does rest with
his holy elect. Psalm. 141.


Thou art going toward thy fathers ^ountry, let thy mind be occupied
there^^re upon the means of coming thy^^er, and of the good enterteynement
thou ^^te like to find there, and forget altoge^^er this present banishment,
for this lit^^e space of time that thou continewest ^^ere, thou have no
certentie of thine habi^^tion.

If thou were sure to continue here any long time, I would nothing maruayl^ at
thy buildinge of great howses, nor (...) thy great provision making, for so
ma^^ things. But thy life being so short, an^ the hour of thy death so
uncertain, th^^ thou know not whether thou shall ly^^ until to morrow:
Thou deseruest grea^^^ to be reprehended, and sharply to be ^^^buked, if thou
sholdest make accomp^^ of any thing in this world, as though th^^ sholdest
always enjoy it. There be ma^^ which build fair howses, and when th^^ have
done, other men do make th^^ dwelling in them. Take not these sligh^^ things
of the world to be any better th^^ they are in deed. And since thou art eu^^ry
hour and momente, departing hen^^ by death, esteem no such vanities of th^^
world, in which there is no stedfastnes n^ assurance.

Every man is well contented wi^^ one evil nights rest in his Inn, when
(...) remembers that the next day folowi^^ he is to rest at home in his own
howse^^ his ease. This only consideration migh^^ suffice thee to suffer with
patience, all the troubles of this present life, remembri^^ with thy self that
they are not long to ^^^dure and continue here: but that thou (...) ready still
every day to take thy iorn^^ thine own house, which is heaven, (...) thou
may take thy rest for ever.

Have always in thy mind the (...) of the holy prophet David saying (...). I
am a stranger here before thee, and ^^lgrime, Psalm. 38.
as my parents have been be^^ me.

If thou do consider how eternal (...) durable that life is, which we look
(...) hereafter that never is to have end, (...) compare it with this life
which we (...) lead here now, (all were it a thou^^^d of years) yet in
comparison of that ^^er life to come which is perpetual, (...) wilt think
this to be scarce half an ^wer.

Make well thine account, and thou ^^^te find (as the truth is in very deed)
^^at this present life is in comparison (...) that other to come, but even a
moment. (...) This moved the Apostle to suffer with ^^ience the great
trauailles and turmoyles (...) his Pilgrimage here, saying to the Co^^^thians.

We do take pains here and do ^^^uaile, but yet we be not forsaken: 2.
Cor. 4.
we ^^fer persequutio^, but yet we shrink not ^t: we are thrown down, but
yet we ^^rish not: we fainte not, because our tri^^lation is here in this
present time but ^ie and short: we live now beholdinge (...) that which we
see with our bodelie ^es, but those things which we see not: (...) visible
things be but for a time, but (...) invisible things be for ever. With ^s
contemplation, both of the brevity (...) this life, and of being but as a
Pilgrim (...) it did the holy Apostle digest the heavy storms which he
suffered here (...) his Pilgrimage toward heaven.

And whylest thou take thy self (...) be but a wayfaring man here, thou ned^
not greatly to care for that thou art (...) better regarded of men here in
this lyf^* If the travail of thy life seem ou^^ burdenous unto thee, remember
it is (...) endure but for a short space. Of the sai^^ of the old Testament,
Heb. 11.
S. Paul says: Th^^ they confessed them selves to be but pi^^grims and
strangers upon the earth, liui^^ in caves and vaultes under the earth, (...)
that in this life they never had rest, (...) continewed still in wandering on
of the^^ pilgrimage.

Live not here as though thou we^^ an inhabiter in this world. Cain began (...)
build cities here upon the earth, and a^^ter he lost the chief city of
heaven. The first that sought to live on this earth ly^^ an inhabiter thereof
being in deed (...) a pilgrim, was Cain, who was afterwar^ damned.

S. Peter was worthily reprehend^^ by our M. Christ, for as much as he bei^^
but a pilgrim upon the earth, would (...) needs have had a house builded on
th^^ mount Thabor, as though he had (...) to have made his mansion still on the
ear^^ and have continued an inhabiter there^^*

They which travail through stran^^ countries toward their own dwelling^
do never use to buy any thing by (...) ^ay as they travail, but that which
they ^ay easalie carry with them, they neither ^^y howses nor trees, nor such
vnporta^^e ware, but only things of easy carriage, (...) Pearls or Jewels
which be of more ^^ice and greater value then they be either ^^mberous or
heavy to carry with them ^^to their country. Remember that thou (...) a
trauailer and a pilgrim, and that of ^^^y worldly substance thou can not
car^^e ought hence with thee. Here must thou ^^edes leave all thine honors,
and riches ^ehynde thee: Thy good works be only ^^e things that thou must
look to carry ^ith thee, and therefore labor thou to ^ette good store of
them: All other things ^olde anoy thee, and comber thee, These ^^ll comfort
thee and relieve thee.

What wisdom were it for thee to ^^eke to be rich here, from whence thou
(...) daily passing in haste, and after when ^^ou art gone hence to live a
beggarly ^^^d a bare life at home in thine own ^owse? Seek to carry with thee
in thy ^^lgrimage the precious jewels of good merits, that thou may come
rich home and live in prosperity and honorable wealth for ever in heaven.

THAT THE BEVVTIE OF THE soul is more to be set by, the^ the bevv^^ of thy
body, which is but a ver^^ small thing to be made account (...) and
therefore is thy mind to be fixe^ upon the contemplation of divine an^
celestial things which ought only (...) be loved and esteemed. CHAP. 15.
Prou. 31.
BEVVTIE is but a vayn^ thing, says the wise man* And if all vanity be to

If thou do love and esteem thy se^^ because thou art bewtifull and fair,

I would not have thee to abuse the eyes with the very first show, or (...)

THE VVEARINGE OF G^^^gious and brave apparel, is not co^^^nient for a true
proffessor of Christ Religion, cheefelye because th^^ tokens of a vain
glorious mind. CHAP. 16.
NEVER boast thee of thy ^^^^mentes, Eccle. 11.
says Ecclesias^^^^^ If the superfluity of ^^^rell had not been rep^^^^sible,
Christ would (...) have commended S. (...) Baptist for his moderation and (...)
^^at behalf: Luke. 16.
Nor S. Luke the Euange^^^^n writing of the rich man, would ne^^^ have touched
him for that he used to ^^^re precious and sumptuous apparel. ^^^nd our
Savior him self says: That (...) which do apparel them selves in (...)
and costly array, Mat. 11.
do dwell in kings ^^^ses, in the howses he says of tem^^^^ll kings, not
the house of the eter^^^^ king of heaven.

Since the holy Ghost the author of ^^^^pture, condemns the proud appa^^^^ng
of the rich man that was damned, (...) commends the holy precursor S. (...)
for the sharpenes and austeritie of (...) cloathinge: It is a great argument
to (...) in how great danger they do live (...) delyghte in rich array, and
how vain ^^^se persons be, that do spend their ^^^e and wealth in such kind
of vanity. (...) If thou do not apparel thee gorgi^^^^y to any ill end,
yet at the least thou ^^^st lose much time therein, which is (...) most
precious thing that thou have.

And although it be not always di^^^^lye a sin to wear such curious and
^^^^ycate apparel, yet has it always some ^^^itie annexed unto it, for
commonly (...) which do wear it, do love the ^^^re to be seen and commended
of men: ^^^cy little do profit in virtue, and their ^^rite does wax cold in
devotion: And (...) when thou have bestowed all thy la^^^r to make thy self
syne and trymme, yet shall thou never be comparable (...) the poor flower of
the field: Mat. 6.
For Salo^^ with all his glory was never like unto (...) of the fresh flowers
of the field.

The Apostle says: That if we (...) wherewith to cloth us, 1. Tim. 6.
let us be con^^^ted. It suffices for the simple follower (...) Christ, to
wear such comely apparel (...) most conformable to his estate and ^^^ling.

Fly from all curiosity, for it is a ^^^ken, that who so sets much by
(...) outward stuff, is little occupied abo^^ the adorning of the inward man.
King ^^^lomon by means of much adorning (...) him self and his Court, fell
to be f^^^getfull of his duty toward God, (...) took little care of his
soul, so as he (...) at last to the adoring of Idols. Men (...) use to
behold the outside, but God l^^^keth into the heart, and they seek (...) how
to content men, that are so much ^^^cupied in these exterior things.

But harken what the Apostle S. Pa^^ says: Gal. 1.
If I should attend unto the plea^^^^ of men, I should not then be the seru^^^
of Jesus Christ. If thou were mortific^^^ thou ought to be, thou would
(...) all these superfluous cares. The outw^^^ business drives away the good
though^^ from the heart, One man cannot suffice^^ so many cares at once, he must
needs (...) in the one of them, and for the setti^^ out of his body confound
his soul.

(...) Apostle says that the holy fathers (...) old testament went appareled
with (...) made of camels and goats hear. Heb. 11
(...) were men as we are: but conside^^^^ with them selves, that they came
(...) out of their mothers bellies, Job. 1.
and that (...) should naked return to the earth (...) from whence they first
came: They (...) still appareled like poor pylgrims (...) this world.

before the fall of man, there was no ^^^itie of any apparel at all, for then
^^^an clothed with the grace of God, (...) son is appareled with light, and
^^^e^cie was then his vesture, more pure ^^^he whytest lylie: but when he had
^^^oste that innocencye, he wexed then ^^^ed any longer to be naked. And ther^^
^id God apparel our first progeni^^^ garments made of beasts skynnes. ^^^or
that man was wounded by sin, ^^^ouered him with clothes, to bind (...) to
hyde his wounds with all. He ^oasteth him of his apparel, is like ^^im, that

(...) was but in vile apparel, when he (...) have appareled my self with

That noble king David was both (...) and very sharply appareled too when he
said: My garment was sack^^ made of hear. Psalm. 34.
To them that do g^ in such vain apparel, God says b^ mouth of his
prophet Esaias: Esa. 14.
VVo^^ shall be thy coueringe: Thou prouo^^ God with such like vanities, who
((...) prophet David says) has them (...) abomination. Psalm. 98.


Bring not into the world new i^^^tions and strange devises of apparel (...)
stand in fear lest thou be punished t^^^^fore at Gods hand, who says
(...) mouth of the prophet Sophonias: (...) bring my visitations upon princes
an^ children of kings, Sohp. 1.
and all such as do (...) in new and strange devised apparel: (...) rich and
curious apparel is only (...) for vain glory and lightness of mind*

Thou do thereby manifest thy (...) to the world, and publish thine own
^^^fectes, and make numbers of men ^^^compte thee for light, whereas ha^^^
thou waste before esteemed for a (...) gravity and good discretion.
Eccle^^^cus says, that a man's appareling, (...) manner of going, Eccl. 19.
give signs what th^^^ is. The outward superfluity is a to^^^ the inward
vanity, and delicate app^^^ declares the tenderness and weaken the mind, for
he that esteems so (...) the tricking up of his body, and hat^ care
therefore, has not his mind ^^^pied in manlye exercises, nor set (...) his
understanding a work, as (...) ^^^ite for a good christian to do.

Thou do take that from the poor ^^ch thou bestowest on thy self in
su^^^fluous vanities. Wear not in any^^^e that which exceeds thy calling
and ^^ree, but such moderate and honest ap^^ell, as is convenient for thy
profession (...) dignity, that thou do give no show ^^ny vain glory or
lightness in thee.

Behold thy Savior Jesus Christ han^^^g naked on the Cross for thy love: and
(...) things thou go about, have in (...) mind Christ that was crucified
for (...), and thou shall thereby cut of a num^^^ of superfluous cares, that
often mo^^eth and troubles thy mind.

(...) AT TRVE NOBILITY IS ^ot that which the men of the world ^o much
glory in, that is to say. The discending of noble houses, and from ^uch
Ancestors as were of singular and rare virtues: But that is true no^ilitie
which every one gets by this ^vvne virtue. CHAP. 17.
HOLY Job in his bitter sorrow and lamentation cried out saying: Job. 17.
Unto curruption and rottennes have I said thou art my father, and to the
worme^ said I likewise, ye are my mother (...) sisters. If thou vain man
will needs (...) hold the original of thy parentage, (...) but open the
grave, and look into it. (...) great vanity that a very worm the so^ of Adam,
should esteem so much of hi^ self for the nobility of his kindred.

A wise man says: To what end s^^ these great tytles, what good do the^^
royal arms and monumentes of no^^^litye. Although all the corners and pla^^
of thine house were filled with the m^^numentes of thine ancestors, yet is
v^^^tue still the true nobility. It were be^^ for thee to be Thersites son,
(who (...) a man of an obscure and base calling) (...) condition to be
Achilles: then to be^^ self like unto Thersites, and to have ^^chilles to thy
father. He like a ma^^ great value and courage, gave the beg^^ninge of
nobility to his kindred, and ^^^uaunced and set up the house from wh^^ he
descended: So did thine aunces^^^ likewise, at the first advance thine ho^^
but in being thy self virtuous (...) might leave nobility to thy child^^^
and those that should descend of th^^ all were it so that there had none
bene^^^ unto thee by those which were be^^ thee, and from whom thou descende^*

If thou be borne noble, and after^^^^ grow to be of a vile, and a base (...)
and of lewd behavior, the nobilit^^ thy blood, will take end in thee. It is
(...) (...) be the begynner of nobility then to (...) the ender thereof. To
set up a state is ^^re worth, then to make an end of yt. ^^rtue begins the
house, and vice ^^keth an end thereof. Thine own evil ^^edes overthrows
clean thine house. ^eeke not for the light of other men's eyes (...) see with
all if thou have none in thine ^^ne. For the light of other men's nobili^^^ will
pleasure thee but little, if thou (...) none within thy self.

It is better to be noble, then to descend those which are noble. It is better
to be ^^^tuous, then to descend of those that be ^^^tuous. And it is a great
token, that he ^^^not virtuous that goes to beg and ^^^owe his virtue from
other men. And ^^^ause thou have it not in thy self, thou ^^kest how to
bewtifie thy self, and set (...) self out with the gooddes of other (...).
It is an argument of great poverty, (...) thou art feign to enrich thy self
with (...) good deeds of thine Anuncestors.

If thou be descended of those which ^oble, so much art thou bound more be
virtuous, that thou may by thy ^^des declare to others that thou art of
(...) generation. Out of one root grow (...) the pricles and the rose, And so
of one ^^^ther may there be borne a noble child, (...) an other very vile. So
may thou (...) out of a root, from whence there (...) come some noble and
valiant men, (...) thy self for all that be but a base bramble or thorn.
Cain, Cham, and Es^^ had all noble men to their fathers, and ^^ble men to their
brothers, but them sel^^^ and their ofspringe, were both vile (...) miserable,
and darkened much the (...) stock from which they were discend^^

If thou do not the acts of Nobili^^^ I cannot account thee for noble. It is
(...) part of a noble mind to forgive i^^^ries: As it is likewise the
property (...) vile mind to be greedy of revenge* (...) the part of a noble
mind to suffer all (...) tribulations of this world with a co^te^^^ mind, and
to occupy thy mind in fru^^^full cogitations, and matters of grau^^^ and not
in these vile and flight transi^^^ things of this world. That is to be
^^^compted true nobility, which ador^^ the mind with good manner and
be^^^uiour. It is not the honor of thy sto^^^ but the Nobility of thine own
my^^^ that shall make thee acceptable in the (...) of God.

The nobility which perteyneth to (...) body is not thine, but theirs from
(...) thou receyuedst it, but the true nobil^^^ in deed, which is thine own
pro^^^ virtue, can neither be given thee, (...) taken from thee. What merit
ough^^^ thou to have for that which other do^ (...) for thee? What praise
may thou ^^^thelie look for of that thing which (...) do inherit by
thine auncesters? (...) nobility of thine ancestors comes (...) ^^neration,
but the nobility of virtue ^^meth of thine own proper work and ^^bour,
helped forward with the grace of ^od, without which thou can do noth^^ge.
This nobility is properly thine.

From a bitter root proceeds often a ^^uite pleasant and delectable to the
taste, and (...) likewise of a base and mean stock may ^roceede an honorable
and a noble of spring ^elighting in virtue and the love of God. ^ut many
because they be borne of noble ^milies, take thereby the more lice^tious
^^bertie to be them selves vain and arro^ant. Ose. 9.
His glory (says Ose) is in his noble ^irth and conception, and so of our
birth ^^roweth vanity. And those things which ^^ey should take to stir them
the rather ^o be virtuous, they take occasion by them (...) be the more vain
and light. The nobi^^tie of their descent should enforce them (...) follow the
virtue of their Ancestors.

There nobility should be unto them as (...) oath of inheritance for to bind
them ^ith all, perpetually to follow the virtue ^f their predecessors. And
those which ^re not such in deed. be as it were mon^^ers, nothing at all
resemblinge their pa^e^tes. Never vaunte thy self to the world ^f thine
ancestors, thy self being so ^arre degenerated from the^, for thou do
^yue to them that do hear thee, great ^estimony of thine own folly.

It is good for thee to consider with ^hy self, what account God makes of
the nobility of Parentages. He chose and to be king of Israel being descended
(...) the meanest family and the least tribe^ all that whole people, 1. Reg. 9.
he made more a^^compt of the value of the person then the honor of the
familye. Math. 4.
When he ca^^ him self into the world, he chose no nob^^ men to his
disciples, but the poor se^^ fisher men.

Our redeemer him self, allthough he were both a king, and a great Lord yet
in confounding of them that made (...) much reckenynge of such vain title he
would him self be called a Pastor (...) Shepherd. It is a thing to be
reprehend^^ in them, that curiously seek out the me^ honorable titles that
any of all their a^^cestors had, to make of that a su^na^^ to them selves.
Drive from thy mind (...) such fancies and dreams. Remember (...) thou art as
thy forefathers were, earth (...) ashes, and the worms will no more sp^^^ to
eat of thy flesh, then they have done (...) those that have begotten thee. The
nob^^litie that thou have of inheritance from them is mortality and corruption.

These may well be the arms, that th^^ may set up in thy shield: not so
much (...) thine house, as in thine heart, let it (...) always a glass for
thee to see thy self (...) And if this be well rooted in thy mind, yt will
expel all thy vain and idle thoughts.

THAT RICHES BE AS IT were certain snares to catch them vvithall, that are in
love with them, and are content to be made slaves unto them: And therefore
they ought of a christian man to be despised and contemned, and in the stead
of them, the stable and suer riches of heaven are to be esteemed which be full
of everlasting comfort. CHAP. 18.
IF riches abound set not thine heart upon them (says the Prophet. Psalm. 61.
) The true seruante of Jesus Christ ought greatly to have in hatred those
things that might separate ^ym from the love of God. Vain must ^eedes those
riches be, that have so vain (...) end. The rich men have slept their ^^eepe,
Psalm. 75.
and have found nothing in their ^andes, when they awaked again.

That thing must needs be vain which seperateth us from God which is ^ur
most desired end. Happy is that rich ^^an that is found without spot, Eccl.
13.
and has ^ot followed after gold, nor put his trust in ^is heaps of money.
Who is he that we may praise him? For it is thought almost a rare thing
amongst men, to separate them selves clean from the love of money and riches.

Every rich man is commonly either naught him self, or heir unto them that
were naught. The falcon when she is too full, will not once know her master.
Luc. 15.
The prodigal son perceyuyng him self to be grown rich and welthie would
not abide in his fathers house, but afterward being nipt with need, and
brought into necessity, he converted and turned back again to his fathers
house from whence he came. Riches did separate him from God, and poverty
brought him home again. If thou will give thy self wholly unto God, thou
must put quite away from thee all wordlie business and earthly love and
affection. Luc. 10.
Thou trowblest thy self about many things, But it is only one thing that
is merely necessary for thee If thou fyndest out that one thing, thou shall
avoid all sorts of vain earthly thoughts.

When our first fathers lived in state of innocence, all occupied in the
spiritual consideration of God, they so much forgot their bodelie estate, that
they were never ware that they were naked. Genes. 3.
But when they had once entered into sin they straight ways attended unto
bodelie things, and knew them selves to be naked. The Apostle Saint Paul
being rapt up into the third heaven, said, that he knew not whether he were
there in his body or without it: 2. Cor. 12
for because they inte^d not to any thing of the body, which are lifted up
into heaven to behold heavenly things. The care that they have about
spiritual things makes the^ to forget these worldly things. Not to be
troubled with the care of the world is true care in deed And not to be wise in
wordlie matters, is perfect and true wisdom.

The disciples of christ being occupied in the doctrine of their master took
no regard of exterior things, Mat. 15
and therefore they sat down at the table with unwashed hands, But the idle
Pharisees took great care of those small matters: Which declares well unto
us, that the care which the servants of God have is far different from the
care of wordlie folks: The servants of the world being still occupied in
small matters, have never any regard unto any greater.

They spend so much time in prouidinge and caringe for the body, that they
have no time left them to spend, in providing for the soul. VVorldly
thoughts and cares be the children of riches, and the occupations and business
which they bring with them do suffocate and choke up the spirit of God.
Despise thou therefore the vanitye of these corruptible things, that thou
may freely yield thy self unto God: and unto God thou can not fly,
except thou do break the bonds wherewith the world holds thee bound. Let
not the sweetenes of this world separate thee from the love of God.

Poison is always given in some sauory and well releshed meat, and when it is
well tempered therewithal, it is easily taken, but he that receaueth it, is
soon after carried to his grave: Even so be riches very pleasante unto them
that do love them, but death does always accompany them, and does bring them
to everlasting death which are made proud and vicious by them. Eccle. 5.
Ecclesiasticus says: He that loves riches shall get no profit by them: what
profit comes by them S. Paul tells: 1. Tim. 6.
They that will be rich do fall into the snares and grinnes of the devil.
All creatures be such unto man, as man is unto him self.

The good soul can take no offense of the things that are without, no more
can the evil soul take any benifite by them: for what profits the multitude
of riches to this flesh of ours the which must shortly perish: they can not
defend it from the corruption which does belong unto it, and in which it
must needs rest at the last. That is a good soul which is not subject unto
riches.

Psalm. 75*
The men of riches have slepte their sleep, says the prophet. He said not
the riches of men, but the men of riches, because they were servants unto
their riches, and not lords over them. That gain which is gotten by the loss
of a good name, may well be accounted for loss and no gain. He is to be
feared that does fear poverty. Servants do serve to ease their masters of
their cares, for one having care of one thing, and an other of another thing,
they divide so the care among them, that the master is by that means at
rest and ease: but it falls out clean contrary by our money and temporal
riches, for they do not take away their masters cares, but do rather double
their cares and their troubles also.

Thou art very vain thy self, if thou do put any trust in the vanities of
this world. It is an extreme vanity to subdue thy mind to the vanity of
this miserable world. Despise with all thine heart the riches of the earth, and
thine heart shallbe replenished with the true riches of heaven.

THE RICHES OF THE WORLD are declared to be but of vile substance, And
therefore vnvvorthye either to be loved or esteemed of a man who is adorned
with so many good gifts by God, to the end, he should not abase him self in
the loving of so vile things, but should wholy direct his love tovvard his
divine majesty, to be after partaker in heaven with him for ever. CHAP. 19.
Philip. 3.
I HAVE not esteemed the things of this world (says S. Paul) any better then
dong. He could inuente nothing to compare riches unto that he could esteem for
less, or account more vile, the^ donge. But if these temporal things were
in deed of very good price and value, yet in respect of heavenly things, they
ought not to be accounted of any value at all, much less ought they then to be
esteemed, being of so vile and base substance, as in deed they be.

Thou think thou do much in the despisinge of the goods of this world:
do but consider a little the vileness of the matter, that all these riches and
jewels of the world be made and formed of, and according to the matter thou
find them of, so do thou esteem them.

What is gold but the very dregs of the earth? What other thing is
silver and precious stones, but the superfluity of the earth, which droppeth
down into some holow place of the earth, and there is gathered together,
norished and increased. What be all these Sattins, damaskes, and all kind of
silks, but the superfluity of vile woormes? And what is your finest cloth,
but of the wulle of a silly beast? What be your fine delicate furs, as
sables, marterns and other like, but only the skynnes of dead beasts.

What be all your costly buyldinges, your painted Palaces, high towers, and
other costly edifices, your mighty and large Cities, are they of any other
substance then earth? And what other thing is honor, but wind? And what is
there any thing in this world, that is not of earth? So that in loving or
esteemynge any thing that is in this world, which is of worldly folk so much
made of what other thing do you esteem but a little earth?

Know and acknowledge that which the world does offer unto thee, and beware
that thou put not thine heart in subjection to such base and vile stuff. Thou
may with good reason be ashamed of thy self, that being a creature of that
excellency, borne to love and to serve God, art yet of so base a mind and
courage, that forsakinge thy creator, thou have bestowed thy love upon such vile
and abiecte things.

Let there be yet at the lest wise so much noble nature found in thee, as to
acknowledge thy self, for such as in deed thou art, and for that excellency
of thy nature which thou have received of God, to give him thanks, and never
subject thy self to any thing meaner then thy self. Love those things
which are the most noble of all, which are things spiritual, and most
agreeable to that noble nature which God endued thee with all, when he created
thee to his own similitude and likeness.

For as love does transform the lover into the thing that is beloved, so as
that lover is brought thereby into the possession of an other thing, and is not
master of him self: Even so thou thy self being so worthy a creature, and
loving these earthly things so dearly as thou do, (being such and so
vile as they be,) thou do give that which is of good value in deed for that
which is but vile and nothing worth Thou exchau^gest most precious things for
things most beggarly, and the thing that of his own nature is most
excellent, (which is thy soul) thou gyuest for the vile muck of the earth,
which is a thing very unworthy and unfit for thine estate and degree,
whereby it not only appears, that thou know not thy self, but also that
thou vnthankefullie renouncest those singular priueleges which God has given
the.

Why does God command thee to love him, Luc. 10.
not for that his divine Majesty has any need of thy love, but for thine
own good and singular benifite. He will that thou shalt love him, because he
would have thee to be honored thereby, and by transforming thy seffe into him by
thy entier loving of him, thou may receive advantage by the exchange, when
thou gyuest things that be good for things that be better, and things that be
precious for things that be inestimable without value.

Thou may see by this how little God esteems these earthly things.
When he deprived his great friend Job (one whom be loved so well) of them,
Job. 1.
at the request of his great enemy the devil.

Open thine eyes and consider how much thou do abase thy self, in the
inordinate loving of riches, and how much thou do exalt thy self again, by
the contemninge of them. Take away therefore thy love from these vanities, and
bestow it only upon Jesus Christ.

NO MAN OVGHTE TO BE proud, nor to glory of his earthly possessions, which
do further nothing tovvard the attaynynge of virtue, but rather as hurtful
things they ovghte to be rejected and abhorred of us. CHAP. 20.
Sap. 7.
COMPARE not the wisdom of God unto a precious stone, for all the gold in the
world being compared unto that, is but as the small sand: And silver in
respect of that shall be accounted but as a piece of clay, says the wise man.
That is great poverty, which the wordl calls riches.

Put not thy mind upon such vanities but lift it up to God alone. Abase not
thy self in subiecting thy will to such vv^e things. God has created thee to
go upright and straight, because thou should look upward to heaven, and
love heaue^lie things. And set naught by these things of the earth.

And because God looks and has respect to help thee, and to do thee good,
therefore has h^ placed all things that thou haste need^ (...) upon the
uppermost face of the earth, as bread, wine, meat and all other things
necessary for thee, because thou might find them redily and easily, at
what time thou had need of the^. But the superfluous things as gold and
silver, he has hidden under the earth, because thou should not wish for
them nor desire them.

Seek not therefore after such false ware. The prophet says: Psalm. 4.
Ye children of men why do ye love vanity, and seek after lying? Thou being
the son of a reasonable man, which haste also the use of reason, do not thou
live so without all reason, as to make these earthly gooddes* the uttermost
end of thy trauailles, since thou wast created for to enjoy the heavenly
gooddes.

All that thou love is vanity (says the Prophet) and whatsoever the world
promises thee, is but lies. This gold is but earth, and this silk (which
thou esteemest for so delicate a thing,) comes from the selie woormes, and
what things be more vile then those? These be those precious things which
adorneth thee: with this dayntie stuff, thou set thy self out to show,
when all this was upon thy back, wast thou clothed with any thing but with
poverty and with vanity?

Be not thou proud of any such like cloathinge, neither do thou vaunt thy
self of thy rich hangings, or other costly stuff that thou do adorn thy
house with all, for though to thy blind eyes, they seem to be great riches,
yet in truth they be none, nor for such are they esteemed of men that be wise
and of understanding. These things be not they which shall make a man rich.

If thou will be rich, thou must love that which is very true riches in
deed. These riches can not make a man wise, humble, patiente, chaste, or
merciful: they convert not anger into meekenes, nor make a cruel man
piteous, nor the envious man charitable. Now if toward the virtue of the mind
they do further nothing at all, but rather (as by experience we daily see)
do make men worse in maynteyning vice and dryuing away virtue: what reason is
it why thou sholdest so fondly esteem them? for even as when thou do norish
in thy bosom serpents and scorpions, who when they have well warmed them
there, will stinge thee and poison thee for thy labor, and do as much as is in
them to kill thee: So with the heat of thy disordinate desires, thou do
norish and augment these riches and delicacie wherein thou lyuest, which being
fostered with in thy bowels, do after gnaw thy conscience, and extinguysh the
good spirit with in thee, and so put thy salvation in great daunger^

This is that which thou have loved so well: O thou blind man. This is that
after which thou seek so fast. And this is that which thou consumest thy
self for. Pray unto God to give thee thy right understanding, to the intent
that thou may know the deceytfulnes of these gooddes which thou love so
well, and that thou may lift up thy heart to the love of those things in
which true riches are to be found.

MAN BEING CREATED TO the image and similitude of God, ought only to love
him, and not these earthly riches, with which in deed he has no manner of
resemblance. CHAP. 21.
DO not thou love the world nor the things which be in it, says Saint John,
1. John. 2.
By the light of natural reason it is manifest, that thou ought not to love
any of these earthelie things, ^or love is a thing of that nature and price,
that it cannot be due unto any thing, but that which is able to render love
back ^gayne, and requite love for love, which ^s the just recompense and price
thereof. and because no unreasonable creature can ^hus do, therefore must not
thou set ^ayne heart and affection upon any of the^. It is a great perverting
of order, to vs^ things to other ends then they are appointed and created for.

Only god is to be loved for him self* as that which is the chief good of
all, and as it were the very center of thine heart* And his creatures must
thou use in their kinds to serve him with all, as he has ordained, but for
that good which thou do thy self take by the^, thou must thank God
threreof, And upon him must thou bestow all the love therefore that thou
can, unto whom it only belongs, and from whom thou only receyuedst the
fruit and benefit of those his creatures. But if thou do love the
creatures them selves, not referring the love thereof unto God* Thou p^ruertest
the order of nature, and art worthelie* to be punisshed therefore.

Genesis 13.
God created man to his own image and likeness, to the end, that (as all other
lyuinge creatures of their own natures do love their like) so he should give
all his love and affection to God alone, and not set his lykinge in these
earthlye and transitory things. But with riches wh^^ resemblance or likeness
have thou? VVh^^ has thy soul to do with gold? Tho^ have to love God only,
after whose imag^ thou art made, And not these earth^^ creatures.

Gene. 31.
All that long time that Jacob ha^ children by Lya, and her handmayde, (...)
never remembered his returning to (...) own country again, for the lovers of
^hese temporal gooddes, being occupied ^boute external things, do forget
heaven which is their true country in deed. But ^s soon as he had children
by Rachell he ^esired to return to his native country ^gayne: And so do all
those which do good works, desire to comme to glory and rest in heaven.

When the king of Egypt was dead, Exo. 1.
the ^sraelites cried unto God, and they were heard. They had cried likewise
before his death, as well as they did after, but he ^arkened not unto them. The
good and the bad do all cry unto God, but God gives not ear unto the
wordlie people, for that they have not killed the king of Egypt, which is
the love of worldly things. But if thou do kill once the love of the world,
by and by, god will hear thee.

This is the very force and true effect of love, to have the to be such as is
the thing that thou love. Thy soul is like unto wax, which takes the
form of that which is impressed therein. That which the seal does imprinte
in it, that shall thou find therein. If thou impresse therein the love of
worldly things, thou must be worldly, but if thou place heavenly things
therein, thou shall be heavenly thy self. If thou put thy glass toward
heaven, thou shall find heaven fygured therei^, and if thou turnest it toward
the earth, thou shall find the earth figured therein. So shall thou always
tak^ that figure which thou will apply thy self unto, and according to that
things which thou love shall thy self be either good or evil.

Dan. 4.
Nabuchodonozer when he was in lou^ with the world he went about the hills and
the wooddes feedinge on grass like a beast. But retorning again unto God by
penance, he recovered his former image, which he had lost before.

Gene. 1.
When God created the son and the moon, and all his other creatures, God
said that they were all good and approved them for such. But when he created
man, he neither said that he was good or bad. Yet are not those creatures
better then man, but less worth the^ man because that for his sake they were
all created. And why did God say of other creatures that they were all good,
and said not so of man that was better then they all? God paraysed not man,
neither called he him good or evil, because he looked that he should so work
with his free will, that according to that which he should chose him self
either good or evil, he should have his denomination and calling. If thou
do love that which i^ good, the^ art thou good, And if thou do love that
which is evil, then art thou evil. So man only because he has his fre^
eleection to take either good or evil* God would first see, both what he
would ^^oose, and what he would love, before he ^^olde give him any addition of
dignity, ^^d then after give him his title accor^^ng to his choice, and this
power has ^ot God given to any other of his earthly ^^eatures, but only to man.

The Apostle S. Paul speaking of a ^ertayne sort of men, says: Romans 1.
That they ^^aunged the glory of the incorruptible ^od into the likeness of a
corruptible man, (...) birds, fowrefooted beasts, and of ser^entes. You may
hereby behold, what ^^pressio^s be made in ma^s soul, through ^^e love of
these earthly things.

The proper habitacion of the soul (...) heaven, Phil. 3.
where they only that be per^^cte must inhabit. Our conversation is (...)
heaven, says the Apostle. The way to ^^e rich, is to despise worldly
riches. It is ^reate riches not to care for riches, Who (...) he that has
much, even he that is con^^nted with a little.

God commanded the Israelites, that ^^ere should no man take away or enjoy
^^y part of the spoils of Iherico. VVhe^ein was signified unto us, that we
should ^ot covet after the mutable treasures of ^is world, which is implied in
this word ^herico, which signifies mutabilitie or ^hange. But as Iosue did
burn and con^ume with fire both the town, and all the ^iches thereof, so
should we that be ^aythfull, consume with the hot burning ^oue of God all the
riches and gooddes of this world, which a true faithful ma^^ should never
esteem or set by, And wh^^ so does otherwise, shall be put to death a^ Acham
was, and committed unto euerla^stinge damnation therefore.

EARTHLY RICHES OUGHT TO be despised together with the desire o^ them because
they are heavy, and do hinder a man that is clyminge vp^^ tovvard heaven.
CHAP. 22.
Luke. 14.
HE that renounceth not all tha^ he possesses in this world can not be my
disciple, sayet^ our Lord. If thou will there^fore be the true disciple of
Jesus Christ, thou must with thine heart despise all the transitory things of
thi^ world. They which followed Christ, d^^^ forsake as much, as they could
desire which followed him not. Our will is so vnsatiabl^ in desiringe, that he
which has mo^^ thereof, is least satisfied, and he that ca^ forsake his will,
forsakes all things. An^ by that means did Saint Peter forsa^^ as much, as
Alexander could desire.

By thy contemnynge of these things thou find thy self: But in the loving
o^ them, thou loosest thy self. Happy is that ^oule that labors in the
renouncinge ^f all those things that the world so much ^mbraceth. Despise thou
corruptible thin^es, to gain incorruptible.

Gold and silver are not a load for ^an, but a burden for beasts. There is
no ^east that carries a greater load then he ^ay well bear, but the lover of
riches ^arieth as much as may be laid by any ^eane upon him: Lighten thy
burden, and ^ast of these false honors from thee, and ^hou shall afterward
go with the more ^ase. Why will thou go so heauelie lade^ ^he^ thou may
have help of the poor ^an to carry part of thy burden for ^hee? Thou
may go best when thou art ^nladen, And wrestle best when thou art ^aked:
when thou do wrestle, with the ^iuell naked, thou will easelie overcome ^ym:
but if thou have thy clothes upon ^hy back for him to take hold on, thou
^ayest easelie be overthrown. Jesus Christ ^ought naked upon the cross for
thee: and if thou will follow him, thou must ^idde from thine heart all love of
temporal ^hinges.

Joseph being tempted in Egypt, Gene. 39.
fled ^waye, and left his clothes in the hands ^f his persecutor, and after he
had dis^hardged him self, and cast his outward ^ooddes away, he became a
great lord and ruler in Egypt. Mat. 19.
They that contemn ^iches shald receive therefore again an hundredth times as
much says our Lord*

There is nothing great, in this world but that heart which contemns great^
things. Who is poor? he that appears rich: and he that most has,
enjoys leas^ liberty, and with less ease does lift up his heart to God.

Crates the Theba^ Philosopher despised riches, because it hindered his
studyinge in Philosophy, and do not thou think that they will hinder thee
more toward the gettinge of heaven? It is hard for thee to carry a great
burden on thy back, although thou walk on the eue^ ground: How much more
hard is it for thee then to clyme up to heaven being laden? What business so
ever thou do go about in this world thou will as much as thou can put
from thee all such cares that should hinder thee therein, and yet in thy journey
toward heaven, thou seek for all these worldly impedime^tes that might
hinder thee thitherwarde. What good does it a man for to gain the whole
world, and to loose his own soul?

Mat 16. Leu. 11.
God says him self that every beast which creeps upon the earth with hi^
breast shall be abominable. And very abominable is it, that man which is
create^ for heaven, should travail and take payn^ in the loving of the gooddes
of the earth* These are very unworthy of heaven these be they whom Gedeon
the nobl^ Captain dismissed out of his army, Iud. 7.
an^ bid to return home again, as men unworthy to be partakers of any
worthy entreprise, who fall down flat to the earth, and lie on their breast,
to drink the running waters of these transitory worldly gooddes.

Get thou as great riches as thou can yet must thou give credit unto Job
that has told thee long ago. Job. 1.
That naked thou came out of thy mothers womb, and naked thou must return
to the earth thy mother again.

The mill wheel turns al day about, and never rests nor stands still.
But turn it never so much al day long, at night yet it stands still, and
rests in the same place where it first began to turn. Well may thou
travail and wander about the world to be rich, and honorable, but when
death comes than thou must needs stay from going any further. Then shall thou
be found in the very same state, that thou wast in, when thou first entredst
into the world, poor and naked thou came into it, and so shall thou enter
into thy grave, and in the state thou were in at the beginning, thou shall
make thy latter endinge, and whence thou came thou shall return, and this
must thou needs do how much soever thou have trauayled in the world before
to make thy self rich and great therein.

It is a vanity therefore in this short life to make thy foundation upon the
temporal riches of this world. If thou contemn them with all thine heart,
thou shall live in wealth for ever with Christ*

WITH MANY GOODLY REAsons and examples of gods friends, he proves that in
this world mournyng is better the^ laughinge, And travail and pain more
profitable then pleasure and solace. CHAP. 23.
Luc. 6.
VVOE be unto you that laugh, for you shall weep, says Christ: woe be unto you
that have your joys in this world, since you shall be so void of all joy in an
other world. VVoe be unto all them that do live in pleasure, for much sorrow
and travail is prepared for them.

Psalm. 83.
Happy is he that in this world being mortified (for Christ) does carry
always about with him the sorrow of his bitter passion before his eyes.

Happy is he, that in this time of tears and vale of misery, Psalm. 41.
is daily fed with tears. Happy is he, who in this time of banishmente, does
make tears his food both day and night. A man that has in his remembrance
the quiet peaceable country of heavenly Sion his own proper habitation, may
well with reason lamente, and be even confounded, to see him self confined
into this place of bannishemente amongst the bitter waters of the Babilonicall
state of this world. Psa. 136 Mat. 5.
Happy be they that weep, for they shall be comforted, says our Savior, and
God him self shall wype of the tears from their eyes, those must needs be
comfortable tears, which the blessed hand of our Master does wype away.

As the land that is never watered, Apo. 7. Apo. 21.
brings nothing forth but bra^bles and thistles and inge^dreth serpents: so
will thy soul bring forth nothing but vanity and uncleanness, except thou do
water it with the water of thy tears: And as necessary are tears to the
soul, as water for the earth. All flesh was corrupted, and for the remedy
thereof, God sent the water of that great flood upon the earth to cleanse it
again. And if thou will let the flood of tears fall upon thy soul and
ouerflowe it, It will kill all sensual concupiscence in thee. Happy is that
flood which mortifieth the body, quenches all worldly desires, and makes
fruytefull the barreyne field of thy soul.

They are but vain which in this life do seek their pleasures and delights.
It is a great error for thee to seek after these temporal consolations. At
the hour of thy death, it will be found better for thee that thou had
lamented, and bewailed thy sins, then in this miserable life to have spent
thy days in deceyuable light vanities. If thou will have thy feast day here,
then must thou keep thy vigil and fast there. If thou do spend thy days in
laughing here in this life, in hell shall thou mourn with death for ever.
Holy Job said, I sighe and am sorry, before I take my food. Job. 3.


In the feasts of the Saints, the vigil comes ever before the feast day,
because they did always in this world fast and take pains, and therefore
afterward they must eat and be merry for ever. The worldly manner is all
contrary, they do first eat and make merry, and then after they do pay
their scot. Death comes and makes the reckenyng for them, and then shall
worldly folk pay dear for their good cheer that they have made hear. Then
shall the laughing and mirth which thou use here, be too well paid for,
with perpetual mournyng there. Those be bitter comforts that must be boughte
with everlasting torments.

Allthough thou do here eat a pace, and take thy pleasure, and take thy
self no care thereof, yet is their one appointed by the governor of the
house, to take the reckenynge and score up all the shot, so that at the last
there shall be nothing left unpaid for.

If thou did but way well this with good consideration, thy charge should
not grow so great, neither would thou with such full scope of liberty give
thy self to the world: But now because thou remembrest not, that these things
shall have an end, (And that thou must give an account thereof, and pay for
all the reckenynge) thou spendest here so freely, for the which thou shall
after never cease thy payement in hell.

And as Job said of good men, that they sighed and sorowed before they did
eat, Job. 21.
so says he of these worldly folk here: They pass forth their days in joy
and mirth, they rejoice and make merry when the music sounds, and in the
twinkling of an eye they disce^d down into hell.

To the rich glotton which S. Luke mentions, Abraham said: Luc. 16.
Thou must remember (said he) that in thy life time thou receauedst joy, and
contrariwise Lazarus received sorrow, and now is Lazarus comforted and thou
tormented. This is the end of worldly comfort, and this is the end of the
vain glory of this world.

Thou shall not find in all the whole evangelists, that ever our savior
Christ laughed at any time, but of his weeping we find often mention made. He
wept at the time of his own nativity. John. 11. Luc. 19.
He wept at his raising up of Lazarus to life. He wept upon the City of
Jerusalem, and upon the cross, And to be short all his whole life was but a
long mournyng, John. 11. Luc. 19.
and a contynualle penitence.

Our Lord says that unless you be as little children you shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven. Mat. 18.
Ye know that children have no other weapon to defend themselves with all, but
tears: And with those must thou likwyse defend thy self from the devil.

Pharao was drowned in the water of the sea, and the devil is destroyed in the
water of tears. Exo. 14.
It is a madness to take pleasure in this life, when thou must live in the
midst of so many great dangers. The wise man says: I have taken joy for
my sorrow, Eccl. 2.
and unto pleasure have I said, why doe^^ thou so vaynely deceive me?

Moses had rather suffer affliction with the people of God, then to be made
partaker of the earthly pleasures of the Egiptians, Exodus 2.
and therefore denied he himself to be the son of Pharaos daughter. The
tears of the just, shall be turned into joy, (says the prophet) And
according to the multitude of my sorrows shall thy co^solatio^s comfort my
soul. Psalm. 93*
It is better to be troubled with the just, then to eat the bread of gladness
upon the table of sinners. It is better to weep in wilderness, than to laugh
in the palace of princes.

Despise thou this soon passing pleasure, that thou may after receive the
unspeakable pleasures in glory perpetual.

GREAT VANITY IT IS FOR A man to give him self unto the pleasures and
delights of this world, the which do run so fast away, and which do
cause him at last to loose the eternal joys of heaven, CHAP. 24.
WHAT pleasure can I have to sit here in the darkness, Tob. 5.
said Tobias to the Angel. It is vanity living here in the darkness of this
miserable world to seek after the^e vain pleasures and fond delights of the
world. We wander in such darkness here that ^vee can not know those that we
daily keep company with all, yea of them that we have continually before our
eyes, we can not tell which be good nor which be bad, the darkness is so great
that many times a man can not see him selfe^

The wyseman says, That a man knows not whether he be worthy of love* or of
hatred. That man that trauayleth by the way, and knows not whether he be out
of his way or no, can take no great comfort of his journey. It is vanity to
take pleasure in the way of this peregrination, not knowing whether it be
acceptable to God, or no? And great vanity is it for a man to take pleasure
in that state, in the which he knows not whether he shall be condemned to
hell. And because this may happen in this life at any time, thou must always
live in doubt and in fear. When thou trauaylest by night, and art
doubtefull of thy way, it were great marueyle to see thee ioconde and merry.

He that sees his neighbors house on a fire, will have little lust to be
merry. And very vanity is it for the to spend thy time in pleasure, that is
given thee to do penance in, especially seeing thy friends and thy
neighbors daily dying before thy face. Of death thou art full sure but of the
state wh^^ein thou shall dye, that know thou little of, and the^ is it an
extreme vanity for thee to forget the fear of God and to give thy self to
laughi^g and making merry.

That father does much more sorrow, then he does rejoice, that burieth his
child the same day that he is borne. The pleasure of this world, in which thou
so much reioycest: does pass away in post, and slydeth away more swifte then
the wind.

Prou. 15.
The wyseman says, that the fool takes pleasure at his own folly. And
folly it is to make account of that pleasure which tarieth no longer with us.
It is a vain thing to give thine heart a taste of that pleasure, which thou no
sooner tastest of, Esa. 24.
but it is gone again. The Prophet Esaias says: they gave great sighs, and
did bitterly bewail that rejoiced with their hearts before, for their joy
ceased even sodenlie.

It is a vain pleasure that the birds do take, when they taste of the corn,
and are straight taken in the grynne, and like unto that is the pleasure of the
fishes, which delighte in the bayte upon the hook, which they no sooner take
into their mouths, but death apprehends them. Thou art as vain and simple
as these unreasonable creatures, if thou do rejoice amiddest all those vain
prosperities of the world, having death so near unto thee, and ready to
take thee.

Remember that the time is short, 1. Cor. 7. Sap. 10.
and let them that take pleasure, be as though they took it not. God brough^
the just man by the right way. The way is right, when the myddest does
answer and is conformable to the beginning and the ending. The man that is
strayed out of his way goes seeking about, to see if he can find it again,
to the end he may get to the place that he intended his journey to, in the
beginning.

The scripture in many places does liken us unto wayfaring folk, Heb. 11. 1.
Pet. 2.
and wanderers by the way. We begin to enter into our pilgrimage when we
be first borne, and it never ends again until death do end it. You may
ask of Salomo^ what our beginning, and our ending is.

The first voice, Sap. 7.
says Solomon that I uttered coming out of my mothers belly, was crying and
lamenting, nether had ever king of this world any other beginning, and like
unto this shall be also thy later ending. Thou wast borne in weeping, and thou
shalt dye lamenting, and will thou yet live laughing?

This is not the right way by the which the just must walk. Go thou the
straight way: be none of those that walk about quyte out of the way, Psalm. 11.
which is as David says, the right course of the wicked. Let the midst be
agreeable to the beginning and the ending: thou begannest in weeping, and after
the same sort may thou well believe that thou shalt make thine ending also.

Tak^ thou no great pains to be rich, seeing that Job says: Naked I came out
of my mothers womb, and naked must I return to my mother the earth again.
Io^. 1.
Never care thou to make proud palaces since a poor little cradle did hold
thee, when thou came first into the world, and when thou dyest, a small pit
in the earth must receive thee again. Never seek to be great in this world
since thou wast so little when thou came first into it, and at thy death when
thou departest from it again thou shall be as low, as thou wast before little.
Thou wast both little and poor, when thou came into the world, and not great
and rich.

Thou came not first into the world ^^ke a co^querour, or a revenger of
quar^els with thy sword in thy hand, neither ^ust thou be such a one when
thou entrest ^^to thy grave. Labor thou also to live after the same fashion
while thou conty^uest here.

Job said unto God, Job. 10.
Give me time O Lord) that I may bemone my self and ^ake sorrow. The good holy
man asked ^ot life of God to lawghe and be merry ^or to take his pleasure here,
but to bewail and to lament, and such ought thy ^yfe to be likewise, and thou
owghtest also hartelie to pray unto God, that it may be such, and that thou
may not spend thy days in the vain heapinge up of riches together, nor in
other idle pleasures of this life, which thou will find a^ the last to be but
a vearie vain folly. Bewail thy sin, and thy offenses, do penna^ce in
this life that thou may after this life obtain the life everlasting.

Our lord says, Io. 16.
that our mourning shall be turned into joy. And happy is that sorrow unto which
everlasting joy succedeth. Love holy compunction, Sighe after the celestial
country, and make not this present banysheme^t a Paradise of pleasure.

Thou vndoeste thy self and art clean gone out of the way, if thou seek to
live in joy and pleasure here in this world. Turn thee back again, and set
thy feet in a better way and embrace the cross of Christ, and think upon his
bitter passion, that thou may comme to the end th^^ thou wishest for, which
is the felicity th^^ thou wast created for.

ALL YOUR JOY OUGHT TO BE in God, for of every earthelie thing the joy is
imperfect, But in him it is so full that nothing can be desired more. CHAP. 25.
REJOICE in our lord always, Phil. 4.
again I say unto you rejoice and be glad, says the Apostle: The pleasure of
the seruante of God, ought altogether to be in his Lord and master. It is a
vain thing to be joyful in any but in God alone.

God will not that thou sholdest live discontented, but he would rather have
thee to be glad and joyful, Only this would he have thee to do: Alter the
cause of thy joy, And convert the false cause thereof, into the vearie true
cause of joy in deed.

The Apostles were vearie joyful, when they said unto their redeemer, that
the devils obeyed them. Luc. 10.
And our lord answered them again, that they should not rejoice for that, but
rejoice, (says he unto them) for that your names be written ^n heaven. He
forbid the^ not to be merry ^ut he would have them change the cause of their
mirth, and whereas their joy before depended but upon a worldly con^ideration,
he would have it altogether celestial which is in deed, the very true
perfect joy.

Every joy that is not of God, is vain: And every contentacion that comes
not from him is false, and has no good foundation. In him therefore must all
thy joy be, and not in any earthly thing of this world. Thou may rejoice
in the testimonye of a good conscience, as the Apostle wills thee which is to
thee as a pleadge from God him self, of the true joy that thy name is
recorded in heaven. 1. Cor. 1.


King David being of the wicked demanded where his God was, Psalm. ^1.
(as he whom they supposed to have forsaken him for his former fall,) found
him self so fainte, and so unprovided in making of his answer unto them, that
the vearie grief thereof, made him so burst forth into tears, that they were
his continual food both day and night until he had found the comfort of
his sweet Lord again. For where God is not, there is it not possible to have
any true joy remaining. Although the scripture does speak sometime of the
joy of wordlie folk, Esa 14. Prou. ^.
saying that they rejoice when they do mischeyfe, yet is that no true nor
perfect joy, because it is no^ grounded upon a true and incorrupte^
conscience.

Of Saint John the precursour of ou^ lord, his holy mother said, that he
reioy^sed in gladness. This is the difference, th^^ is between good men, and
ill men's joys These do joy in their vanities, And the other do rejoice in a
good conscience. This is the rejoicing of Saint John in joy.

Luc. 1.
That joy must needs be vain which has not the grace of God for his
foundation. If thou do stand in good state toward God, then shalt thou have
true joy, and if thou can get God, then shall thou have all joy in him.
VVilte thou have riches? Psalm. 3.
Behold it is written: Glory and riches be ^n his house. VVilte thou have
beauty? Can. 4.
Our Lord says unto his spouse. Behold my friend how fair she is. VVilt
thou have life? Behold I am the life, says God. Ioh. 14.
VVilt thou have salvation? I am, says our Lord, the Savior of the people.
VVilte thou have peace? The Apostle says: Ephesians. 2.
That our Lord is our peace, which makes agreemente betwixt God the father
and us. VVilte thou have honor? Behold what is written in the psalm. Thy
friends be very honorable, and their domination is comfortable.

If thou have God with thee thou have perfect joy, for with him thou ha^te as
much as thou can wish: with good reason, and for just cause is he joyful
that ^^th with him the fountain of all joy.

Away with all this temporal joy, for an ^^che of one spiritual joy is more
worth ^^en all the false joys and pleasures that ^^e world can bestow upon
thee. There (...) no taste of true joy but in God alone, for (...) worldly joy
does soon vanishe away ^gayne.

Ismael Abraham's son according (...) the flesh, Genesis 21.
had soon spent^ and ^onsumed the water which his mother ^^gar and he carried
for their comfort and relief: But Isaacks lasted and conti^ued, who was the
child of promise. The ^omfortes of the world shall soon have an and in the
wicked, but the spiritual con^^lations of the just, shall be like springing
^^elles of water which never sh^^l fail: ^nly this joy is certain and sure
whereof ^ur lord speaks: No man shall take your ^oye from you. John. 16.


Many worldly men do glory in their garments, but that glory is their
gar^entes, it is none of their own. Others ^oast them of their riches, but
that glory ^ongeth to the riches, and not to them that do owe the^. This joy
is not theirs, it ^esteth in te^porall things. They may soon ^e without that
joy, if they be without ^he things which brought the joy.

But that joy which Christ calls our ^oy, no man can take away from us, which
^s the joy of a good conscience. This is our own proper joy, which no man can
take away from us, but if we be contente^ to depart with it our selves. This
is the joy which we have, not of any creatu^^ but from the creator him self.
Among^ the fruits of the holy Ghost, S. Paul r^^keneth gladness to be one.
Gal. 5.


In creatures their can be no perfec^^ joy, but only the joy is full an^
perfect of it self, which is in God o^^ creator, because it is infinite and
without end, according to the goodness of him th^^ it proceeded from. Joy is in
comparion to desire, as rest is unto motion: for the^^ is our rest quiet and
perfect when the^^ is not any thing more to be moved: A^^ even so shall our
joy be full and perfec^^ when there is not any thing more for (...) to desi^^
or wish for.

And because that in the things of th^^ life, our desire never finds perfect
re^^ hereof it grows, that in the creatures (...) this world it never
finds perfect ioy^* Therefore do thou love God alone, wh^^ fills thy soul
with good desires, and (...) the only cause of thy perfect joy.

Psalm. 102.
The prophet David says: That (...) only fills our desires with good things

Anna the mother of the prophet Sa^muell said my heart reioysed in ou^ Lord,
and in my God was all my gladne^^ So do thou rejoice only in God, because the
joy of this world is false and vain^ the which shortelie passes away and
vani^sheth.

^OVV GREAT SO EVER ANY man's honors in this world be, yet they all vanysh
away at the last, and true honor does only rest in the servants of God, both
here in this world, and in the world to come. CHAP. 26.
THY friends are very honorable (O Lord, Psalm. 138
) and their government full of comfort. Thus says the prophet david. If
thou be the friend of honor, th^^ art (...) enemy of God, for he only has
true ^^nor, that is in the favor of god. It is va^^ie to seek the honor of
this present ^^rlde, for with pain it is gotten, and ^^th charge maynteyned,
and quickly it ^^gone again. Only true honor belon^^th to the servants of
God. All those ^^om the world does honor and extol ^^re not the friends of
God.

That honor which the saints of God (...) both here on the earth, and also in
^^auen, was not gotten by the seeking of (...) but by the flying away from it.
VVilte ^^ou be honorable? Then must thou hum^^e thy self and be brought low.
VVilte ^ou that all men shall know thee? Labor thou then to be known of no
body: (...) like a shadow that flies from him whi^^ follows it, and it is

(...) never so vile a sinner, thou shall not ^t commendacions and vain praises
^he people, but when thy playing time ^nded, and all that thou had borrowed
^ore of the world, restored again, as ^e will they set then by thee, as they
(...) set by the paper puppet before, that (...) so much esteemed and followed.

Thou must remember, that all thy ^^ddes, honors, and dignities be all but
(...) unto thee here for a time, and all^^ughe thou do possess them for a
^^e, yet may thou well see, that they be ^ne of thine, since when thy life
for^^keth thee, thou can not carry them ^^aye from hence with thee, since
other ^^lkes must then adorn them self with ^^at, which thou did so much
magnify ^^y self with all before.

When the journey of thy life is ended, (...) an end is also all thine honor
and ^orldlie reputation, and in the earth must ^^ou lie all poor and naked
while others ^ake merry with that which thou so much ^steemedst.

The great estates and kings of the ^arth that sat sometime full high in
their ^^rones and seats of Majesty, all clad in ^urple and rich array, unto
whom folk ^owed their knees* and made low curtisies, ^s unto some earthly
God: The same folk after (when all the honor was gone, and ^hey laid low in
their graves) went walking over their heads, and shew^ small reverence to
those whom they (...) greatly magnified before. This is (...) worldly guyse,
to day in honor, to (...) row in dishonor. To day every man sp^^^keth
honorably of thee, And to mo^^ not one that will remember thee. A^^ passes
the wind of this vanity, the fe^^ lasts not long, and at last in short
spa^^ comes all the honor to naught.

O I would to God, that unto the ea^^nest lovers and folowers of this world^^
false honors and vanities, there were (...) worse to fall unto them: The^
after th^^ they should be once deprived of them (...) death and clean
forgotten of word^^ people, there might no more harm co^^ unto them. But this
is (loo) a miserab^^ thing, and vearie fearful to think (...) that after
these short days be ended (...) which they have served the world, th^^ which
continued in their vices and eui^^ life unto the end, shall burn in hell (...)
after for ever. This end have the vanitie^ which thou seek after, and in
this do^^ the honors end, that thou so much de^lightest in.

The true seruante of Jesus Christ, does not desire this temporal honor,
which he acknowledges for vain, and transi^torie: The seruante of Christ
sets more by the honor of his Master, then he does by his own honor and
commodity* Happy is he which in all that he does* ^^^ireth nothing but the
honor of God. (...) Happy is he which imbraceth humi^^^^e, and follows his
master Christ there^^ and dispiseth all the vain honor of (...) world from
the bottom of his heart, ^he end, that he may reign with Christ (...) ever.

Care not for the false honor of this ^^rld, that thou may get the true
ho^^ur of heaven, leave not the truth for (...) shadow.

The Apostle says, 1. Cor. 14.
be not ye in your ^^ce and understanding like unto children. ^^ildre^ do
more delight in horses made ^reedes, and puppetts made of clowtes, ^^en in true
horses, and very men and wo^en in deed. Thou must not be a child, ^^d set
more by a shadow of truth, then (...) the truth it self.

The riches and honors of this world (...) but shadows of the true riches
and ^^nours that be in heaven. And since thou art a man of reason and
judgment, put not thine affection upon these slight soon sliding vanities.

ALL DESIRE OF VVORLD^^ honor is to be fled, for by them d^ thou incur
infinite dangers (...) losinge thy soul, and by them th^^ are great offenses
committed agai^^ thy lord God. CHAP. 27.
BE NOT thou desirours (...) take any worldly domin^^^ at man's hand, Eccl. 9.
neither d^^ thou seek for aduaunc^^ment of the king, says th^^ wise man.
Those that (...) to clyme up in the tops of howses, are (...) great danger
of fallinge, wherefore it be^houeth them to have a good stayed he^^ lest they
fall and do break their nec^kes. If thou do follow after the hono^^ of
this world, yt will be needful for the^^ to have a good brain, and to stand
well i^ gods favor, for fear lest thou fall into hell.

Prosperity is more dangerous th^^ adversity. The prophet says: That
(...) thousand shall fall at thy left hand, Psalm. 90.
an^ ten thousand upon thy right hand. The^^ were more in number which
perished vp^on the right hand of the honor and feli^city of this world, then
were those which ^erished on the left hand of base degree and mean fortune.
The felicity of world^y folk, is as it were an offense with out ^orrection. In
place of honor look that ^hou set not thy self, for there art thou ^ubiect
unto much danger.

The frantike person has many ima^inations, and if he drive them not away from
him, they will put him into great ha^arde. Leave the vain desires of honor,
which thou cariest about with thee in ^hyne head, for if thou put them not
^way from thee, they will put the life of ^hy soul into vearie great danger
of ^estruction. Take away from thine heart ^he vanity of proud thoughts and
high minded conceytes, if thou will obtain ^aluation. Thou will never be
^^red, ex^ept thou do drive from thee th^se imaginations.

VVorldly honor is dangerous, and in ^t full many have perished and been lost.
^ome have their worldly honor so dear unto them, that to mainteyne the same,
and keep the good opinion that they suppose ^he world has of the^, they will
not stick ^o offend God, and to defame their neigbour ^o whom they will not
seek afterward ^o restore his good name again, which is ^y the^ impaired for
fear lest they should ^rgue them selves of their former wrongs, And so thereby
decay their own credit. And rather then they will loose one ^ote of their
worldly honor and reputation, they will remain in hell for ever* And rather
then they will pay that which they owe, (while they shall thereby abat^^ some
part of their worldly worship and estimation, for the payment of their
debtes,) they will venture to go to the devil, and cast away their souls for
ever.

They be like unto those great me^ which Saint John speaks of, which
believed in Christ but they durst not confess it, for fear of the phariseys,
lest they should have been driven out of the Sinagoge, Io. 12.
They loved more the glory of men, then the glory of god. This is a
dangerous state, in which these lovers of worldly honors do live, that they
determyn^ rather to loose their souls, then the honor of ^his world.

Pil^^e condemned our savior, although he knew him to be innocent, for to
maynteyne his own credit thereby amongst the people. He knew well enough our
Saviors innocence, He saw^ that he was delivered into his hande^ through
envy, and he was also very desirous to have delivered him. But when hi^
accusers told him, Io. 19.
that if the should (...) him escape away, he was not to be accom^^ted Cesars
friend, so greedy was he (...) worldly honor, (which he stood in fea^^ to
loose by their means if they shol^^ accuse him to the Emperor of any ^^uour
bearing toward Christ,) that for the saving of his credit, and maynteynyng
(...) ^is worldly honor he gave sentence of ^eath against the author of life,
And would rather go against all reason, and his ^wne knowledge, then fall
tnto the disgrace of his Prince. And was contented to ^ffende God, rather then
to diminishe any ^arte of his woorshipfull estate, or lose ^is credit with the
Emperor. And if ^hou wilt prefer worldly honor before ^he love of God, thou
must needs fall unto a thousand of such mischiefs.

Many be they which go to the devil ^or the maynteynyng of their credit in
^his world. This is a dangerous estate, and if thou did but well consider
of ^he dangers in which they do live that ^re put into high dignities and
honors ^f the world, thou would from ^he bot^ome of thy heart, with all
earnest affe^tion, determyne resolutelie with thy self (...) renounce all
these vain dreams of ^orldlie honors and promotions, which ^owe thou set
so much by, and do (...) disordinatlie love. How many have pe^^shed through
honors.

In what honor was Adam when he ^as placed in the earthly paradise, Gene. 3.
Job. 1.
and yet ^ow grieuouslie offended he? Contrarie^ise Job was beaten down with
many tri^^lations, and had many occasions given ^ym to offend God, and diverse
impedi^ents to serve him, And yet all this suffi^^d not to make him to sin.
Adam was (...) great dignity obeyed of all, and Job lay in a stall dispited
of all. By this tho^ may perceive what danger there is (...) the dignity
and honors of the world, and what suertie is found in the despising and
contempt thereof again.

He which stands on the top of a steep slipperie tower, is in great
hasa^^ of falling: And in much less suertie b^ they which climb up to the
tops of ho^^ses, then they which walk below on th^^ even ground: in a low
estate thou ha^^ not so much to fear, and live in bette^ safety.

In noble men, and men of great est^^^ we see much idleness reign, which is
the mother of vice, and stepdame to all virtue. They spend their life, and
consum^ their d^yes in idle pastimes, vain delighte^ and banckettes. God is
more displeased by them then by those that ge^ their living by the sweat of
their brow^^*

But will thou get the life everlasting* Then must thou in this life, make
store* and set much by those things which an^ much worth there. The marcha^t
that will thrive, buieth his ware good cheap when it is plenty, and sells
it dear again (...) places where it is scant. Thou desire (...) go to
heaven, and thitherward thou an^ now travailing: take not that with thy thither
which is good cheap there. The^ be all manner of honors riches, and
p^^^sperities very abundant, follow (...) counsel, and carry with thee
thither, the kind of ware, which is not there to be gotten, thou shall be
sure to sell it well, and to have good payment there for it.

All manner of tribulation, persecutions tears, fastinges, and all works of
penance, be things which are not there to be had, nor none such found there.
If thou do therefore provide thy self good store of this ware, when thou
come thither thou shall be suerlie well paid for the same, and so thou shall
be rich therewith and live thereby in honor for ever. And if thou go laden
hence with vain honors and pleasures of this world, they will yield thee
little, in the next world.

Therefore leave of that trade betyme and meddle with none of that kind of
stuff, let these false honors go set not by these short sliding pleasures of
the world: They will but work thee dishonor and shame, fly from them here,
and thou shall win thereby true honor in heaven.

THIS VVORLDLY PROSPERITY* ought much to be feared, for as much as many great
men of this world, which have been good and just in adversity, have yet in
prosperity been found to be full of vvretchednes and iniquity, commytting
diverse offenses, which have been both against gods high honor, and their
own salvation. CHAP. 28.
Prou. 1.
THE prosperitye of fools will be their own confusion, says the wise man:
thou ought to stand much in dread of prosperity here in this world, if
thou seek to conserve the humility of heart, and to serve Jesus Christ.

Saul was as good, and as holy a man as any was in all the land of Israel, 1.
Re. 9.
when he lived in mean estate, but after he came unto honor, and was advanced
to the dignity of a king, his worldly prosperity made him proud and high
minded.

David when he was persecuted, could give life unto Saul his enemy and
persecutor, 2. Reg. 11.
which he had in his power to ^aue taken from him, but after in his great
^rosperitie, he would not spare the life of ^is faithful friend Vrias. He that
in per^ecution gave life unto them that had ^eserued death, in prosperity
slew those that best deserved life. It is a rare gift to ^se prosperity well.

Thou must not in worldly prosperi^ie live all at adventure, for so great is
^hy danger, as thy negligence is great in ^hy government. That part of thy
life must needs be greatly in danger, which is neglected through too much
assurance of thy self. We have seen many men very virtuous and much fearinge
God, who when they were advanced to high rooms and dignities, fell into pride
and dissolute lyuinge. Beware th^^efore of worldly prosperity, as of a most
manifest pestilence

Upon the high hills of Gelboe, 2. Reg. 1.
the noble men of Israel lost their lives. And in the prosperity of this
world, does many a man daily perish: unto prosperity is joined the
forgetfulness of God.

Joseph prayed Pharaos cup bearer to have him in remembrance, Gene. 40.
when he should be restored again to his former estate of honor. And the holy
scripture says of him: That as soon as he had gotten out of prison where
Joseph and he had hene long together, and that he was restored unto his office
again, he quyte forgot his friend and interpreter Joseph, he put him in mind
that he should not forget him, when he was restored to his room again, because
he knew that prosperity was the time of forgetfulness.

Pharao king of Egipte, in his prosperity said that he knew not God, neither
would he let the people of Israel depart away from him: but in his tribulation
he began to know him, and besought Moses and Aaron, to pray unto God for him.

Mat. 17.
Saint Peter being a lofte in glory upon the top of the mount Thabor, wished
for three Tabernacles there, One for Christ, One for Moses, and a another for
Elias, and never remembered him self, nor any other of his fellow disciples.

Do not thou marueyle at this, for prosperity, and worldly glory, makes a
man to forget both him self, and all the friends that he has.

It is more dangerous saylinge upon the sweet pleasant waters of the running^
ryuers, them upon the salt and bitter waters of the sea. And so is thy
salvation in more peril when thou live amongst the prosperities of this
miserable world, then when thou live in the bitter storms of tribulation.

Prosperity shows always a friendly countenance, and contynueth still at hand
with us, which makes us the less to suspect it, and take no regard thereunto,
whereby she takes better occasion to link her self in league with our flesh
against us, so as they both join together, and assault our poor soul.

But it is the best way for thee, when ^hou art in prosperity, to think
allwaies that there is a storm coming at hand. And then shall thou take it,
but as a thing ^ent unto thee.

And again in tribulation thou may ^omfort thee with the remembrance that
^hy troubles shall not long last, and so shall ^hou carry one indifferente
face toward them both.

And if thou will live with Jesus Christ for ever in an other world, thou must
fly from the prosperity and vain honors of this present world: and better it
is for thee to be afflicted and troubled with Christ, then to live in all the
prosperity of this world. Take it for great good to thee, to be persecuted
and tormented with Christ thy redeemer, Mat 5.
for unto those that are persecuted for him belongs the kingdom of heaven.
Despise the felicity of this world, that thou may get the true honor which
endures for ever.

THE PROSPERITY OF THIS world gives shevve of the pains and infelicitie of
the next, And the persecutions and afflictions suffered for Christ, are sure
testimonies, of his divine love, And of his chosing of th^^ to be of the number
of his elect. CHAP. 29.
2. Tim. 3.
ALL those which seek to live religiously in Christ Jesus do suffer
persecution, says the Apostle. The barreyne trees which yield no fruit, are
never shaken nor beaten, but are at last cut down, and cast into the fire: as
our Savior Christ said by the withered fig tree. But contrariwise happens
it unto the good trees, which though they be well shaken and beaten for to
gather the fruit, yet are they neither cut down nor destroyed. Luc. 13. Math.
7.
Our Lord likened men unto trees, which when they be good, are persecuted, and
when they be naught shall be bur^ned in hell fire.

If thou be persecuted be not dismayed, but yield thanks to God, that has
admitted thee to be one of that number that he has chosen for him self.
Christ ^ym self was persecuted, so were all his ^oly Apostles, and all his
friends. If thou ^uffer no persecution in this life, thou ^ughtest much
therefore to be afraid ^^ste thy punishment be reserved for thee ^ltogether
unto the later end, when death shall cut thee down by the root: and do ^ot
thou think that thou art the better ^eloued of God, for that he suffers no
persecution to fall on thee.

Christ gave with his own hand unto ^udas his bread dipped in the liquor of
^he tender Lamb, Io. 15.
whereas his other disciples did eat their bread dry, without either liquor
or leuayne: yet was not Judas therefore either the more favored, ^he more holy,
or the more perfect. And when thou likewise do eat thy meat dressed
delicately after the finest fashion, do not thou think thy self therefore to
be better then the poor souls which do eat their bread dry.

God deals his temporal benefits most liberally to the sinful wretches of
the world, and shows them outwardly the best favor. Io. 12.
Unto Judas he gave the bag of money, and to his other disciples he gave the
travail of preaching.

Unto Judas he gave the most sauorye and the most easy part: but unto his
well-beloved Apostles, he gave his vnsauorye and hard persecutions.

It is better to be poor with the Apostles, then to be rich with Judas. Mar. 55
It is better to eat the bread of penance, amongst the disciples of Christ
with sorrow and fear, Mar. Vlt.
then to live in the pleasure of vain joys amongst the servants of the
devil.

Take courage unto thee in thy persecution, and harken what our Lord says
unto thee. Io. 15.
If they have persecuted me, they shall persecute you also. Thou must not
think thy self to be better then Jesus Christ, neither let it come at any
time into thy thought that the same glory which his holy mother bought with
so many afflictions and persecutions shall be given unto thee, living after thine
own will without any suffering thereof at all.

That rest which the friends of God have gotten by sufferinge of much vexation,
and many tribulatio^s, shall not be given unto thee, living at thy pleasure,
and revenging of thine injuries. Be not proud that thou have no persecution,
but take it rather as a most grievous persecution unto thee, that thou were
never persecuted.

The physician suffers the sick man to do what he will and to have his own
lust in every thing, of whose recovery he is in utter despair: which he
will not do unto him, of whom he has good hope of amendment.

It is a great show of thy damnation, if every thing come to pass as thou
would have it, and that thou have thine own ^il in every thing as thou
would wish it. ^appie is he to whom God is him self ^^isition, by taking of
his worldly com^^rts away. Happy is he that with patience ^^ceyueth at the
hand of God adversity and tribulation to cleanse his soul with (...). Mat. 5.
Happy be they that for righteousness ^oe suffer persecution, for theirs is the
^^ngdome of heaven.

Even as thou suffrest thy self with ^atience to be let blood, and to be
^urged for thy bodelie health sake: so ^ughtest thou most joyfully to take
per^^cution for the saving of thy soul: And ^oke not so much to the present
pain which thou suffrest, as unto the salvation which thou seek. Remember
not so ^uch the present pain which thou fee^st, as the reward which thou
^^okest after.

He that passes over the Sea, and would ^ot be troubled with vomiting nor have
^is head to turn about with giddines, ^et him cast his eyes toward the land*
So must thou cast the eyes of thy mind ^oward heaven, the vearie true land of
^he lyuinge, and never look upon the tro^lesome waters of worldly
persecution, ^eyther cast so much in thy mind the ^resent dangers of this
tempesteous world, in which thou art now sailing, as ^he pleasant country of
heaven, toward which tbou art going.

Saint Stephen in the persecution of those stones which were thrown at hy^
lifted up his eyes toward heaven. Act. 7.
And y^ thou will not be troubled, thou must think upon the reward which thou
art to receive hereafter. Thou must suffer i^ this life many persecutions, if
thou will get the eternal life. This is the money which God makes payment
withal unto his servants here. With persecutions they be healed, and
therewith be the spots of their sins wyped clean away.

Some be so like unto little children, that they had rather be sick still,
then take any pain to get their health again. Think it not better for thee to
lie sick for ever in hell, then suffer in this life a short persecution for a
time. The greatest glory of a Christian man is to suffer persecution for Jesus
Christ. 2. Cor. 12.
S. Paul after he had been taken up into the third heaven by God him self, and
there received many great graces and gifts at his hands, with sundry
spiritual consolations, yet would he never glory in any thing but in his
infirmities and persecutions.

A gentleman will sooner boast him self of those hurtes which he has
received in the wars, and in the things which he has done in his masters
service, then he will in the favors and gifts which he has bestowed on him.
So should a good seruante of Jesus Christ glory more in his persecutions
suffered for his master Christ, Mat. 5.
then in any other ^races and gifts which he receives at ^is hand:.

Let thy glory be in the cross of thy ^^rde, and in thy suffering for him,
for if ^ou will take part with him in suffe^ing of persecution, thou shalt
after en^ye with him the fruytes of thy tra^ayles.

WORLDLY FAVOVRS DO keep a man from knovvynge of him self, and do so
drive him into pride, that he loses thereby the grace of God, and his
celestial gifts, except they be te^pered with humility and knowledge of
him self. CHAP. 30.
A MAN was a great man (says the scripture) and highly favored of his
master Assuerus, Hester. 3.
But what profit took he by all the favors and benefits that Assuerus
^estowed on him. They served him to ^o other end, but to be the instruments of
^is own fall and perdition.

Thy soul must needs run into great ^asard amongst these worldly favors,
when as the favors which God bestowe^^ upon his own especial servants be
(...) without danger. Our nature being (...) weak through the evil
inclination* that is in it, does often take harm even by those favors, which
God him self gives us.

Mat. 16.
Christ praised Saint Peter, calling^ him happy, for that the father of heaven
had revealed unto him that which (...) most co^fide^tly pronounced of him. Yet
(...) much was he blinded with that favor received at Gods hands, that within
a while after he sought to have hindered the blessed passion of our redeemer,
for the which he was worthily rebuked at our Lorde^ hand. Now if through our
own evil handling, w^ do take harm of these fauour^ which we have at Gods
own hands: what effect is the favor of the world like to work in us?

The favors that Joseph received of his maistres in Egypt, were but as
occasions and means to make him offend God, and to cast away his soul: and
think thou not that human favors can serve thee to any other end.

They are of the nature of wine which stil^ fumeth up to the head, therefore it
is necessary for us, that these worldly fauour^ be tempered with water (which
they do power upon us, and (as it were) delay withal the heat of our
te^porall favors) that by murmuring and grudging against (...) do cause that
these favors of princes (...) worldly honors, do not fume into (...) heads to
make us drunk therewith. (...) because we should not be puffed up (...) much
with superfluous praises and fa^^rs of the world, the providence of God ^^th so
ordained, that we should sometime (...) bitte^ by sclaunderous detractors, to
the ^^d that when the tongue of the flatterer ^^th made us overmuch to rise up
in the ^^king of our selves, the tongue of the ^^ckebiter and murmurer might as
much ^^ayne depresse us and humble us.

Reprehensions and mislykinges of men ^^e bring us to the knowledge of our
^^lfe. The favor of the people entringe ^^nce into our soul takes away from
us ^^e light of reason, whereby we might ^^owe our selves.

He that is overmuch favored, is know^^ of all other men, but yet he knows
^ot him self: but he that is disfauoured and lives in disgrace, knows him
self and is not known of other men. It is ^uch better that a man know well
him^^lfe, then to be known of all other men, and not known to him self: and
more ^arme does a man take by favor, then by ^isfauour: and more hurtefull is
love then ^ate unto him. Hate is one kind of per^ecution to a man, and
persecutions be ^rofitable because they do humble a man, and make him to know
him self: but ^oue does make a man blind, and takes from him the knowledge
of him self, (...) for that cause is it better to be persecu^^ then favored.
In persecution thou shall find God: and in favors thou shall lo^^ him: and do
not think, that because th^^ art favored and do live in the prosp^^ritie
of this world, that thou art therefo^^ any thing the better beloved of God.

Remember what the Gospel saye^^* Forget not that in thy life thou
rec^^^uedst thy joy, Luke. 16.
and Lazarus his woe, (...) now must Lazarus be comforted and th^^ tormented.
If in this life thou have fa^^ and honor, thy salvation is thereby the more in
hasard, and it is a token that th^^ art not appointed to be an heir of the
joys of heaven. The laws do not all^^ that a bastard son should enter as
hey^^ into (...) fathers possessions.

Abraham gave gifts unto Ismael and (...) the rest of his children, the
inheritanc^ of his patrimony remayninge whole (...) Isaacke his true heir and
successor. (...) those which do degenerate from G^^ (their true Father) by
vicious and lew^^ living, he bestows only upon them (...) gifts of this
world, which be honor an^ riches.

They which most of all do enjoy th^^ world with the offending of God, and the
are set alofte therein by having of man honors and dignities, are after
exclud^^ from the inheritance of glory which (...) reserved for the good, who
despising (...) ^^^^ors of this world, do hope as lawful ^^res to be
admitted to the inheritance heaven. And the worldly folk must ^^tente them
selves with their worldly ^^tes, without further hopinge for any ^^^er
prefermente in the inheritance of ^^^uen. Do not thou marueyle if the ^^^ked
do flourish in this world, for our ^^ristian Religion does promise here no
^^^or, but contempt and dispising. The ^^^ked men have nothing in heaven:
nei^^^r have the good men any thing in this ^^rld. Esteem not thou the favor
there^^ but as the good servant of Jesus Christ, ^^^ecte with patience that
glorious day, which thou may enjoy the euerlas^^^g treasure of heaven.

^HE BEST AND THE REAdiest way for the vvynninge of Paradise, is to suffer
persecutions and tribulations in this world, and for that purpose be they sent
us by God, that we may be purged by them, as gold is purged by the fire.
CHAP. 31.
THROVGH many tribulations must we enter into the kingdom of God (says the
scripture. Act. 14. Psalm. 60^ Prou 13.
) Suffer with patience tri^^^ations and afflictions: for our Lord says: I am
with thee in thy tribulati^^*

Tribulation is the faithful mess^^^ger of God, which carries health and
^^^^uation with it. And as he that does i^^^rie unto an embassator of a king or
a (...) man, does also injury to him that se^^ him: So does he offe^de God,
that is gr^^ued at his tribulations. And God will p^^nish them, 2. Re. 20.
as David punished Amon, (...) dishonoring the messengers that he se^^ unto him.

Tribulation is to man as the fyle is (...) iron, the fan to the corn, and
as (...) fire is unto gold. Deal mercifully wi^^ Sion (O Lord) that the
walls of Hie^^^salem may be builded up, Psalm. 50.
says the pr^^phete unto God.

1. Pet. 2.
S. Peter calls us the stones of (...) And thou can not serve for a stone
(...) that glorious building in heaven abo^^ except thou be first well
squared he^^ and made just to lie in the foundation (...) the workman, who
uses these tribul^^tions, as hammers and edge tools to bri^^ thee to a right
level and a perfect squ^^^ and the persecutors be they which (...) make the
wall, and are appointed of G^^ to be the masters of that work. He the^^^fore
that will not be persecuted, will (...) dwell in the heavenly Jerusalem in
(...) glory everlasting.

King David was a better king then ^^^lomon his son was, for the father (...)
know to be saved, but of the son, (...) opinion remains doubtefull, and yet
^^^ids life was al full of affliction, tears, (...) tribulations: but Salomons
was all ^^^trary, who lived always in peace and ^^^speritie. Tribulation put
David's life ^^ssurance, and prosperity put Salomons ^^^ation in doubt.

Tribulation lighteneth the vnder^^^^ding. Gene. 42.45.
Joseph was not known to his ^^thers when he honored the^ and made ^^em good
cheer, but when he wept and ^^^ented upon them, then was he by and made known
unto them. And there^^re does God give to thee tribulation, ^^cause thou
sholdest know him, since ^^en he makes much of thee, thou will ^^t know him
at all. And because thou ^^^epest so soundelie and forgettest God, (...) takes
from thee, the pleasure and de^^ght wherein thou layest so much at thine ^^se
before, and sends thee some trou^^es to make thee starte out of thy sleep
^ithall, to the end that thou may the ^etter remember thy self, and
acknowledge ^ym. So did David deal with Saul, 1. Re. 26.
when ^e took from him his spear, and his ^essell of water, and so made him
to awake, and afterward he acknowleged his fault. Be not thou overmuch
grieved, when God ^aketh thy worldly comfortes from thee, ^or he does it but
for thy greater benefit.

Thou shall recover by tribulations ^hy sight again, Tob. 11.
as Tobias did by the galle of the fish. When the wild bull is coursed with
in the listes, if happily (...) one do walk by without any care him self,
yet if he see the bull co^^ running toward him, he will straight by him out of
his way, although that thought him self never so safe and (...) before: So
does God send thee tribulati^^ in this life, to the intent that thou may^^ have
good regard unto thy self, and may^^ put thy self in safety, by turnynge
(...) self unto him, and taking him for t^^ safegarde. Psalm. 15.
The psalm says thou didd^^^ multiply their miseries and infirmities* after
they made have unto thee. I^ as favors and felicities, do make the go away
from God, so do tribulation make thee draw near unto him. In tribu^lation
(says the Prophet) he called upon God. Psalm. 119.
The more that the waters of the flood did increase, Gene. 1.
so much more was the Ark of Noah lifted up, and the more th^^ the children of
Israel were afflicted (...) Egypt, Exodus 1.
so much more did they increase (...) multiply. So the waters of tribulation
do^ lift us upward toward God, and by the^ is our merit increased, and grace
aug^mented.

Take therefore a delight in tribula^tions, for it is a vearie ready way for
the^ unto heaven. Act. 9.
The first thing that God wrought in the conversion of S. Paul was to make him
blind, and throw him down to the ground, to give us thereby to understand,
that the first beginning of (...) true seruyng of God, comes by tri^^^^tion.
The corn and the chafe re^^ne both in the floor together: Even (...) this
world are good men, and evil ^^ed together in company. But when ^^ynde of
tribulation blows up, the ^^ked are blown away, and scattered ^^ugh anger
and impatience, and the ^^^d are thereby united and joined to^^er. That which
does hurt unto evil (...), does good unto the just.

By much beating, at last, the black ^he is turned to be white. If good men
^^gather any spotte of sin through to ^^^h favor and prosperity of the
world, ^^^n adversity comes, it takes it clean ^^^y from them. The
chastisemente of (...) in this life, is like unto the correcti^^^ of a pitiful
father, who ever i^ his ^^^ishmente remembers mercy withal. (...) the
punishment of the next world is ^^^hout all participation of mercy,
ac^^^ding to that which the Prophet said ^o God. Psalm. 2.
Thou shall rule them with thy (...) of iron, and thou shall break them in
^^ces like unto the vessels of clay.y. Choose then rather to be afflicted and
persecuted in this world, seeinge thou may by so short a suffering, gain
thy self thereby perpetual rest in heaven.

OUR BEING OVER CAREFV^^ for matters of this world, (beside it shows
diffide^ce in gods prom^^^ made unto us,) it lets and hynd^^ us, from our
spiritual exercyses vvi^^ we ought most to attend unto. CHAP. 33.
Mat. 6.
BE not ye careful for which you shall eat drink, nor take you thought for
that w^^^^ you shall were on (...) backs, says our redee^^ Much vain
carefulnes about temp^^^ things does ouerchardge our spirit^ wings, by the
which our soul (...) fly up to the contemplation of thi^ eternal.

God made man such as he should be (...) to understand and know his chi^^ good
and final felicity, that by the ^^^derstandinge thereof, he might love and by
loving of it, at the last enjoy which he loved, from the enjoying w^^^ of we
be kept by the overmuch (...) and love of these worldly things. Exo. 12.
If children of Israel had been careful abo^^ that which they should have
eaten, dro^^ or worn, when they should have (...) ^^o the desert they would
never have gone ^^t of Egypt, nor never have entered into ^^e land of promise.
If thou will enter ^^to the land of promise, thou must cut (...) the
superfluous cares of these transito^^e things.

And the greatest part of those He^^ewes, Number. 11.
which were by gods mercy deli^^red from the bondage of Egypt, because ^^ey
were to careful, (after they were (...) men into the desert) for their food
and ^^e provision for their belly, longing still ^^ter flesh meat, and their
old good fare (...) Egypt: they died in the wilderness, and ^euer obtained
their desire in the entering ^^to the rich fruitful land which was ^romysed
them.

Labor thou not for temporal things, and thou shall win erernal things.
And ^oe not seek too greedelie after these ^^sible things, lest that thou do
loose the ^^inges invisible.

Unto certain men, (that had so much ^^re of their own matters, that they
for^^t gods causes,) God him self said: because ye have attended with to much
^^re to your own howses, Ag. 1*
and have let ^^y house stand desert and forsaken, therefor shall not the
heavens yield you any ^ater, nor the earth any fruit. It is but ^^eete and just
they should want all things, which forsake the maker of them, for their ^wne
worldly business.

God compares the life of the just, unto the birds of the air, as well for
the little rest they have, and the small suert^^ they find in the earth: As
also because their ordinary abiding is alofte in high places. Hereof it is,
that Christ reprehe^^dinge the careful life of worldly fo^^^ reproves them
by the example of the bird saying. Behold the birds of the air, Mat. 6.
they neither sow, nor reap, no^ gather into their barn, and yet our Lord
feeds them, A foul shame it were (...) thee, to consume thy self with the
care (...) trauayling after this foul earthly muc^^ when thou may with the
same care g^^ the sweet flowers of Paradis. VVh^^ wrong do thou unto thy
self, to wea^^ out and to tier thy self in seeking after thi^ world, when
thou might with as little travail find out heaven it self? Even for the
very honor of thine heaue^lie father thou owghtest not so to do. For this
ou^^ great diligence and carefulnes of the son, does as it were privily
reprehe^^ the necglige^ce and carelesnes of the father about the provision of
things necessari^ for his child. For when the child does ta^^ so much care, yt
argues little care in the father.

Thou can not therefore without so^^ reproof to thy heavenly father, set
thy care, and thy mind altogether about the^^ temporal things, as though he
had (...) care at all to provide necessaries for hi^ children. The birds of
the air tarry n^ ^^nger upon the earth, the^ their necessity ^^forceth them,
the most of their life they ^^e spend ordinarily in the air above: and if
thou will escape the dangers of ^is life; thou must fly from the earth as
^^rre as thou can. Thou must seek by ^^templation to get up to heaven, if
thou ^ilt keep thee safe from taking harm on ^^e earth.

When God created the birds and ^^e fishes, Gene. 1.
he gave unto them his benedi^^ion, but unto the brute beasts of the ^^rth he
gave not his blessing at all: and he ^^at will get that blessing, which god
does ^^ue unto good men, must do his best to ^^e from all those dangers
which he ^^ethe others to perish in. For unto those which live disordynatlie
on the earth, de^^ghting in all earthly pleasures like unto ^^ute beasts, God
will not give his bles^^^g at all, but rather his maledictio^ say^^ge, Mat. 25.
Go ye cursed of my father into ^^erlasting fire, which is prepared for ^^e
devil and his aungells.

Seek to live like a bird on high prayer and contemplation, putting all ^^y
care upon God, according to the say^^g, of the Apostle saint Peter. 1. Pet. 5.
Put all your ^^^e upon God for he it is, that takes care (...) you all. So
said the prophet. Psalm. 93.
I am po^^e and needy, but our lord has care of (...).

And if our lord have care of thee, ^ake (...) thou too much thought and
carefulnes for these temporal things, which se^^ for nothing, but to
extinguysh in thy^ heart the love of God. Luc. 8.
The carefulnes (...) riches does suffocate the word of God (...) thee. It is
no marueyle though the ge^^tiles and infidels lived still in care, beleui^^
and trusting in fortune as they did: (...) thou, which art a christian, and
beleeuest (...) providence of God, ought not to be (...) refull about
temporal things: for th^^ know that if thou do that which longs for
thee to do, God will promi^^ all that which is necessary for thy life.

And if he maynteyne the birds which he created for man's use, will he not
may^^teyne man also, which he made for hy^ self.

Make thine heart clean, and dis^charge it of all carefulnes and exterio^^
business that thou may the easelier li^^ it up to heaven. Io. 19.
The distraction of the heart cools the affection of love, and putte^^ man
into many temptations and daunge^ of the devil. Our sensual part is ve^^
strong, and must well be looked unto for yt desires by all means to
satisfie^ self in the vanities* and pleasures of (...) world, whereby the
understanding (...) darkened, and the spiritie become^ insensible, and every
spiritual excerci^^ unsavory and without taste.

Much business and occupations (al^though it be in things lawful) do bri^^ a
great distraction to the mind, whi^^ ^ill hinder much, thy praying and
deuo^^on. For they will not suffer the most in^^arde parts of thy soul to
gather them ^^lues together into any quiet, unity, and accord.

Exterior occupations do blind ^^e sight of our understanding, and do
^epriue us of our true light: he that will ^^yue him self wholly unto God,
must se^erate him self from every worldly care, and exterior occupation.

HOW DECEIVABLE AND false the vvisdome of the world is, which judges only
by those things which appear good to the would, not considering how
acceptable to God they be, and what revvard they do deserve, which for the
love of God despise all those things, which the world holds most dear.
CHAP. 33.
THAT which is foolishnes before God, 1 Cor. 3.
the men of the world esteem for high wisdom, says the Apostle. The world
accompteth him for a wise man, which best can cloak his own vices here
amongst men, and so behave himself (...) he can get the dignities and honors
of th^^ world, and those it holds no better th^^ for very fools which
despise all such va^nities.

Srp. 5.
The wise man said in the person (...) worldly folk. We have taken the (...)
of just men to be dishonorable and full (...) folly. The world calls them
wise (...) which desire these false honors, and be^stowe all their travail and
labor in (...) getting of them. And those that live (...) to this world, the
fond wisdom of (...) world reputeth as dead folk: they are laughed to
scorn of worldly men, a^^though they had no wit in their heade^* The foolish
wisdom of the world, knows not that the servants of Christ be like unto
^^ndles that be lighted, the which this world like a boisterous wind blows
and puts out: and therefore they that be good in it, do seek to hyde them
selves out of the way to be in the more safety: they care not for to show
their holiness, but unto him whom they seek to please who is God him self, who
beholds not the out side but looks what is within.

The wisdom of God is clean contrary to the wisdom of the world: Good men
are little esteemed of worldly folk, and are much esteemed of God. The
judgments of God be very far differinge from the judgments of men. The
world ^ooking only to that which appears on ^^e out side, takes him only
for happy which is mighty and rich.

When Samuel went about to anoint ^ne of the sons of Isay to be king of
Is^aell, 1. Re 3.
he refused him whom the father es^eemed most likely, and anointed David ^ing
who was thought most unlikely ^mongest them all: and the other children of
Isay that most were esteemed of men, were rejected in the sight of God. They
that were accounted wisest amongst men, were taken for most ignorante before
God, and he whom the world esteemed ^east, him did God choose to be king.

He that has a cause to plead before learned Judges that can skill of
justice, cares not much though he be first condemned by some ignorante Judge
before, because he knows that he shall after appeal before a learned Judge,
whose sentence he knows to be of force and auayleable. VVorldly men be such
judges ^here of the good, and do condemn them for very fools and people of
no value: and this sentence holds for good while this life lasts, by which
they be all condemned, and so do live here in this world like persons
condemned and despised. The Princes of the world had never any better opinion
of our holy Martyrs, seeing them dye so willingly for their faith: and many
wise men of the world esteemed for very madness, the wilful poverty and
beggerie which they saw ^^^ny good men sustain for the service (...) Christ
their master, who had suffered (...) them so great and extreme poverty
b^^fore.

Act. 26.
A worldly wise man said unto S. Paul the Apostle. Thy much lerning^ has
made thee mad. S. Paul made an^swere, I am not mad, I speak the word^ of
truth. And because that Festus did not understand the mysteries of the Apostl^
doctrine, he reputed him for a fool, as the world does now esteem all that
for foolishenes, which it neither co^prehendeth* nor understands, for want of
knowledge and practice therein. This is that judgment which the world gives
like a blind^ and an ignorant judge, upon those which be good and just in the
world. But when death comes, the seruant^s of Christ shall appeal to God, that
great learned and skillful judge, who knows well all their whole cause, And
then shall he condemn that former false sentence of the world for unjust, and
shall give him self a clean contrary sentence, which shall be irreuocable, and
never called back again* wherein he will pronounce, that the worldly men
which flourished in this life, were vain and foolish: And those good (...)
which the world condemned, were (...) wise and discrete.

Therefore let it never grieve thee, that the world condemns thy life, for
thou ^^st thy remedy of appellation where ^^ou shall have full restitution
again. ^he day is at hand, in which the chief ^dge of all, will approve that,
which the ^orld has reproved.

Do not thou therefore care for the ^^rldes condemnation. The redemer of ^^e
world was esteemed of worldly folk (...) a fool, and for such a one they
appa^ed him in Herodes house. The deep ^^d high wisdom of God, Luc. 23.
is reproved by ^^e world, as that which their blind eyes ^^ll not serve them
to look upon. They ^^ndemne at their pleasure the good and ^^rtuous men of the
world, but of their ^^inions take thou no regard, for soon all their vain
judgments be confoun^^d, and the true virtue made manifest.

^HE VVISDOME OF GOD exceeds all the depth of man's vvisdome, the vvisdome of
the world being foolishenes before God, and by the contemnynge of the world
is that other vvisdome gotten. CHAP. 34.
IF any be wise amongst you, 1. Cor. 3.
let him be as a fool, to the intent he may be wise, this says the Apostle.
There is not a higher point of wisdom then to become a fool for Christ. The
wisdom of God which consists in true mortification and denying of our
selves, the world takes for foolishnes.

The wise man says, I am the most fool of all, Pro. 10. Luc. 16
and the wisdom of men is not with me. The children of this world be wyser
then the children of light. And therefore said the wise man, that the wisdom
of men was not with him, but the wisdom of Christ which the world esteems
folly.

The wisdom of Christ exceeds all our understanding, and therefore the
world calls it folly, as we call commonly all that folly which exceeds
our capacity.

The Captain in the field sometime so o^dreth his army, and sets so his
battle in array, contrary to the common custom, that the soldiers
understanding nothing thereof, do take the enterprise for vain, and the
Captain for a fool. And because the wisdom of God exceeds all our
capacities, it is called folly.

As the wise man said in the person of worldly folk. The son of Justice
has not shined upon us. Sapi. 5.
He speaks not here of this material son, which shines both alike,
as well upon the justice unjust: But they were not lightened from above, with
the light of his high celestial wisdom, because the weak eyes of man's
understanding, can not endure to behold the great light of gods wisdom. All
the while that Moses was in Egypt, Exo. 4.
he was both wise and eloquent with all, but when he was to speak unto God him
self, he confessed his insufficiency of speech, for before God, the wisdom
of man becomes stark dumme.

Solomon was a vearie wise man, Prou. 3*
but comparinge his wisdom with the wisdom of God, he called him self the
most fool of all others.

This is great wisdom in us, to despise the world for god. He knows much
that knows how to save his own soul: and he his only wise, for all other
are but foolish and ignorant. In the true despising of our selves consists
the altitude of Christian wisdom, And before this high wisdom, is every
great knowledge very perfect ignorance.

All though thou were never so perfect in all the liberal sciences, what
profits it thee, if thou be ignorant in thine own estate? That exterior
knowledge, is to be accounted no knowledge in deed.

Happy is that soul that is replenished with the wisdom of God, and perfect
happy is he that seeks to be wise before God, and makes no account of the
wisdom of this world. One drop of this wisdom of God is more worth, then
all the huge Seas of worldly wisdom. In this school must thou study day and
night, seeking for true mortification. The more that thou have of true perfect
knowledge the more ignorant thou shall be toward the world, and as it were one
dead in it.

Genesis 32.
Jacob after he had wrestled with the Angel, remained lame of one of his
legs, and was after called Israel, which is as much to say as man that
sees God, and so he that sees and knows God, must be lame outward to the
world.

If thou do see therefore worldly me^ goinge carefully, and diligently to
get honor and worldly riches, do not thou marueyle thereat, if they go not
lamelie, nor haltinglie about that busynes, for they have but a small
knowledge of God. The just men that do see God, as Jacob did, through the
knowledge that they have of our Lord, are as it were lame in the knowledge of
earthelie things, And those does the world think fools, because they be
wise before God.

When the superior and chief part of thy soul, is full of the wisdom of
God, by thy firm fixing of thy mind therevpo^, it fares by it, as by the
moon, which in the conjunction thereof with the son, is so fully possessed
with the beams and light thereof, that it casts no part of her own light
toward the earth. No more the soul of man, being fixed upon the love of God,
and fast joined thereunto can have any light left in it, to cast or to bestow
upon the earth, or earthly things, but has that part clean empty, that
should look that way. The fool (says Ecclesiasticus) changes like the
moon, for leuing the divine light, Eccl. 27.
and the clear shynynge of the son of justice, does wholly convert him
self, to the inferior things of the earth.

This worldly wisdom is comfounded by the wisdom of Christ. Exodus 7.
The serpent of Moses deuowred all the serpents of Pharaos magitioners: So
does the wisdom of God swallow up and consume all the wisdom of the world.

In the old law God promised riches and such things as men naturally do
desire in the world, but there were at that time very few that would turn to
the Iewysh religion, and the very true worship of god. 1. Cor. 1.
But when our savior of the world came, and promised unto men persecu^io^ and
affliction (which men do naturally hate) all the world was converted unto God.

The wisdom of God is of that force that it took the vearie weakelinges of
the world to convince the strong, and the ignorant to confute the greatest
learned: Romans 1.
unto the wisdom of God all things are subject. And they that called them
selves wise, were the most fools of all, says the Apostle.

This wisdom would the devil take from thine understanding, 1* Reg. 11.
as Amon would pulck out the right eyes of the Israelites which is the knowledge
of heaue^lie things. The eyes of a wyseman be in his head, which is Christ him
self, for the wysema^ seeks to know God, and in that knowledge does
exercise him self and take delight, according to the saying of Saint Paul:
1. Cor. 2.
I confess that I know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified. Behold
and read in that book, and let all thy exercise be in the reading of the
Passion of Jesus Christ, to the intent that by thy knowing of him here in
earth, thou may afterward perfectly know him in heaven.

OUR LIFE IS SHORT, AND passes away like a vvynde, And it is less also then
yt seems to be, for yt is no perfect life, but a shadovv of the life to come.
CHAP. 35.
Job. 14.
THE days of our life be short, (says Job) they pass away like flowers, and
our years consume away like dew upon the face of the earth. Iam. 4.
And S. James says. That our life is but a vapor, which soon appears, and
in a moment is gone again, And like a cloud in the air, which as soon as
the sun shyneth, is dispersed. This life so much esteemed amongst men
seems for a time to make a stately show, and to carry great countenance in
the world abroad, but what it is in truth, may easlie appear by the
casualties which it is subject unto. By how many infinite ways, is our life
taken away from us: by any light distemperature casting us in some fever, or
other infirmity, it is gone in an instant, and into Ashes soon is tha^
converted, which was so highly esteemed of men before.

What is the time of our life, Job. 7.
but even a pufte of wind? It passes like a post, and as a geast that never
retorneth again.

Even as a lightenynge in the air, that in the twinckeling of an eye is
vanyshed away, so passes away both the life and the glory of this world:
Eccl. 3.
Unto vanity is every creature subject.

Recke^ up all the days, the months, and the years, of your life, and tell
me where they be now? They are all passed away like a shadow, and like a
spiders web, that is blown away with the wynd so is all thy work
perisshed. There is nothing stable here upon the earth, of which Ada^, and all
his progeny are formed.

There is nothing shorter then life, which carries death about with yt, It is
both short and miserable, which goodmen do sustain with patience, and wicked
men do love with delight. But for all their much loving of yt, they cannot
enjoy yt, any long time. We do all die, 2 Re. 14.
and as water that runs and never retorneth again, so run our days away,
says the scripture.

There is no stream that runs so fast away as the life of man does: the
water streams never turn back again, and the days which are passed are not
to be called again, the time that thou have lost is unrecoverable.

Thou may sit like another Tobie upon the river bank of Tygris, Tob. 6.
and by the fearce running of that swifte stream thou may well consider the
swifte running of thine own life away. That river has his name of his swifte
running, and yet is not the course thereof so swifte as is the course of thy
life, which hasteneth thee on so fast to thy grave.

In the consideration of this fast running st^^ame may thou well wash the
feet of thy souls affections. In this contemplation may thou wype away the
filth of this earthly love, that so cleaves unto thee by means of thy worldly
business.

The life of man is but a deceyuable dream. Psalm. 115
The prophet says* I said in my spirit that every man is a liar. And
according to the translation of the seventy interpretors, Psalm. 38.
David said not: That every man is a liar, but that every man is a lie: the
very life of man is a lie: It is not that in deed which it seems to be, it
seems long, and is very short. Because I believed, I had knowledge of my
self, and was humbled.

In an image does man pass away. An image is but a figure of the truth, and
this life is not a true life, it is but a figure of life, and a shadow of
death: it is not that which it seems, it is but only a shadow of the truth:
It is an appearance of life* which runs in such have, that it is impossible
to be restrained or held back. And as our life runs daily away from us
toward our end, so with our life runs also away all our honors, riches, and
pleasures, which waited on our life, like an inseperable shadow. The sinful
delight which was taken in them, is then at an end, but then begin the
torments due for the sins committed by them, which never shall have end. The
odds whereof is very great: the delight but short* and the torment
everlasting.

What thing is their in this world stable and permanent? Riches, honors,
and pleasures, how soon be they gone? Hear what holy Job says. My life is
short, Io^. 9.
and my days pass like a post away. For as a post is no sooner comen, but
that he is straight gone again, so is our life soon come, and soon gone
again. With our youth, does all our beauty pass away, and shortly after
passes away and perishes all that ever we delighted in beside.

SO GREAT IS THE LOVE OF God tovvard us, that this life here being full of
sorrows and afflictions, He of his goodness has shortened yt, that we may
sone be ridd of these infelicities and miseries. CHAP. 36.
MAN is borne to travail, (says Job. Job. 5.
) In weeping we begin our life: in trauayll do we continue it: and in
pain do we part with it. That sentence was given by God upon our father
Adam, Gene. 3. Job. 7.
that in the sweat of our brows, we should eat our bread. And since the
whole life of a man is nothing but a contynuall travail and labor upon the
earth, God of his great love toward man has so appointed it, that the time
thereof is much shortened and abridged, to the end that we may labor but for
a short time.

The mercy of God is such, as he will not have our labors and trauayles to
endure for any long time, neither co^se^teth he to any great continuance of
them. And where as we live like bannyshed men in this life, he condiscended of
his great goodness toward us, to make short the time of our bannyshement.
And whereas he has made us, to be partakers of his joy with him, And that our
glory and propre country is in heaven above, he would not have us to be long
from him, but is as desirous to have us with him, as some one man that is so
far in love with another, that he can not live one hour without the sight of
him. In the shortenynge of our life, he has showed how much he has loved us.

Also he would that for our benefit, our life should be shortened, because that
men should despise this short life, and love the life eternal: Job said unto
God: Job. 7.
Pardon me (O lord) for my days be nothing. Because Job saw that his days
were nothing in deed, he began to ask pardon of God, and to do penance.

Many live so, as they should never lie, being so occupied in the vanities of
this life, as though it were given them to do nothing else in. Whereas it is
given in deed by God, to be well employed, and to be spent about his business,
and in providing for the life to come. He is worthy suerlie of just reproof,
that thinks here of any other thing, then the getting of that life which
endures for ever.

If thou but considerest the shortenes of this life, and wayest withal the
eternity of the other, thou will easily be led to despise this present life.
God seeinge how the malice and noughtines of men increased, and that many took
courage to offend him, upon the confidence of long life and time of repentance:
he determined to cut it shorter, because they should not grow to bold in
sinning upon trust of their long life. And because the long time which he had
granted man to live, and to do penance in was abused, he abridged i^, for he
saw well, that it served to no other end (as it was used by man) but for the
multipliyng and increase of sin.

When men lived more simply in the beginning of the world, God granted
them long life, but when he saw them use it evil, and that iniquity
increased thereby, he made there time shorter. The Prophet says talking with
God. Psalm. 89.
Thou have set our iniquities in thy presence, and our age before the light of
thy countenance. All our days were shortened, and in thine anger were we
brought low. After seventy years be past, our days shall be but even like
unto a spiders web.

The Prophet says, that for our sins God shortened our life. The misery and
brevity of our life, does the Prophet here express, by the comparaison of the
spider, which with great travail and pain, weaueth a fine and a delicate
web, which afterward a small blast of wind breaks, and takes quyte away.
And so our life which is with so much labor sustained, as soon as any blast
of sickness or infirmity comes, is straight taken away from us, and therefore
so short and so transitory a thing as that is, is not inordinatlie to be
loved or esteemed.

This life is not heavenly, but earthly, it is not our country, but our
bannyshement, God will not suffer it to be perpetual, but vearie short. This
life has an end, but that life where God inhabiteth with his elect, has no
end.

A fond fellow were he, that would not have his journey soon at an end, to be
at rest in his own country: and he that takes pain, and laboreth hard here
in this present life, is very vain and foolish if he desire not to be at quiet
rest for ever with Christ, in the most joyful dwelling place of heaven.

What slave is there any where so much made of, but that he would yet gladly
be at his own home? And who is he that lives in a dark dongeon, but would
willingly be where he might see light? This world is not our country, but a
Babilonicall prison, and who so desires long life, desires a long
imprisonment. And he that desires old age, desires a long infirmity, and
where no true life is, there ought thou to long for death. Death serves us
as a medicine for the trauayles sustained in this life, which never have end,
but when our life ends: and he that must needs depart hence, better it is
that he go betyme then tarry to long.

Happy is he that bears this life with patience, and desires, by death
(...) come unto a better. And happy is that soul, unto which God grants
rest in the life perdurable. God is good in all his works, who has here
shortened this life, for thine own good and commodity, that thou may the
sooner come to the life eternal.

INNVMERABLE BE THE dangers, unto which this life of man is subject, and in
how much higher state he lives here, into so many more trovvbles and dangers
is he brought by means of them. CHAP. 37.
Psa. 102.
HIS days flourished like the flower in the field: says the prophet David,
speaking of the life of man. To how many dangers is the flower in the field
subject unto? The son burns it: the wind dries it up: man treads it
down: the beast eats it up: the water ouerfloweth it: the heat withers it
away.

What tongue can declare the dangers that man is subject unto and the perils
that his life daily runs in. A little ^^row consumes him, Sickness makes
(...) end of him, The Sea drowneth him: ^^finite be the inconveniences, and
innu^erable be the means, by which his life ^ay be taken away from him when he
^^ast thinks thereon.

Job said: My days do pass away as ship laden with apples, Job. 9.
and more lightly ^oe they go away, then the post that tra^ayleth by the way:
they fled apace away, and saw not any good at all. He said tru^y that his
days paste faster away then the ^ost, for run the post never so fast, yet
^ust he stay sometime by the way to take ^is repaste in eatinge and drinkinge,
and ^ome time must he bestow also in slee^ing. But the days of man are
always ^n their course, and never stay one whit, ^ut always run on a pace
toward d^^th: ^hen thou sleep, when thou wakest: all ^he times, hours, and
momentes of thy ^^fe, thou runnest with all speed toward ^eath.

Job likeneth also his life to a ship. The ship was not made to lie still
at an ^^cker, but to sail, and to travail from port, to port: no more wast
thou made to continue still in pleasures and delight, ^ut to the end that by
thy travail and pain taking, thou may at last come unto the quiet port of
salvation. And as the ship sayleth with great swiftenes, and ^ea^eth no
printe of the place which she passes by: so passes our life away without any
stay at all and leaves no memo^^ of us after we be gone.

What is become of all the kings (...) princes that have lived in the world.
(...) paste lightly away, and left no token behynd them of their being here at
all.

The dangers also of a ship sayli^^ in the sea be not few nor small: she
stry^keth against the rock and spliteth asond^^ The tempest comes and
ouerwhelme^^ her, The Rouers come and spoil (...) And lastly set her on fire.
But if thou co^^sider now the dangers in which tho^ live, thou shall find
thy self enuiron^^ with many more sorts of infirmities an^ dangers, the^ the
ship is. The ship parte^^ from the haven with a prosperous wind setting up her
sails, and all her streame^^ with great iolitie and mirth. But after (...)
has sailed a while, she strikes upon (...) rock, and then is all the mirth
turned in^^ mourning. So when man is borne, an^ enters first into the world,
the friends (...) parents make a great feast and solempniti^ thereat, but all
is in vain: For when by some chance or infirmity he dies th^^ does all the
mirth and joy determyne (...) take end again, by sorrow and lamentatio^* In
the mornying (says David) he flor^^shed, Psalm. 89.
and withers again at night.

The shipp says Job is laden wi^^ apples, and not with iron or lead, (...)
any other ware of weight. The days (...) man be freight likewise with much
(...) vain stuff, which is of no value, neither leaves any good memory
behind, but a small smell of fame, like unto rotten Apples, whose sent is
soon gone, and quickelie forgotten.

From the dangers and mishappes of this miserable short life, can no man
escape, be he never so great. But rather they which carry the greatest ports,
and be of highest degrees in this world, do suffer most dangers, and endure
most sorrows in it. The hearts of Princes and great men, have many a thorn in
them, which are covered upon with very rich array and costly apparel.

Their life is full of heaviness and care. And the mighty men of the world, lie
they never so soft in their delicate dayntie beds, yet carry they often to
bed with them, an heavy heart, and a suspicious mind: Neither much delight
or favor can they take in their ordinary pleasures, they be so cloyed with
the common use of them: But when troub^es and misfortunes do come, their part
is greater in them then other men's is, because they have been always now
seled in pleasures and delights, and throwgh the long lordly liberty which
they have lived in, they think that they were not borne for those adversities.

The mean sort of people, may better abide tribulation when it comes and take
more comfort therein, because they are more inured with affliction. And great
men do as little escape dangers, as the other, but rather of the twoe do
taste of them more often then they. But unto all sorts of men in general, God
would that this life should be troublesome and dangerous, because they
should seek after the life that he has created them for, which is the
eternal life of heaven.

THE TIME OF OUR LIFE being short and uncertain, we ought not to prolonge
our penance, lest we be taken by death vnprovyded, and so svvalovved up by
the devil in to hell. CHAP. 38.
Ec^l. 5.
BE not slack in turning unto our Lord, neither defer penance from day to
day, for suddenly shall the anger of God fall upon thee, and in the day of
vengeance shall it destroy thee: says Ecclesiasticus. Thou ought to do thy
penance quickly, seeing thou have not one hour of life sure for thee to live
(...). God says: I will not the death of a sinner, Ezech 33.
but that he should be converted and live. God does here promise thee pardon,
when thou do ask it, but he promises thee not, to morrow to ask it in: why
put thou of thy penance for a time, which perhaps thou shall never live to
see.

He that is of great wealth, and has fair inheritance of his own, what
matter is it though he do spend some of his moveable goods? But he that has
no more then he gets day by day* and must also give a reckeninge to his
master of that: to what purpose should he be lavish in spending? VVilt thou
then, that have not one day certain to live, expect for the year that is yet
coming to make thy penance in? Thou which art so poor of time, that thou
have not one hours life of certentie to recke^ upon, will thou so liberally
promise to thy self many year to live? Cast not the time away which i^ given
thee: make not thou to light account thereof: remember that thou art but poor
and miserable, And yt may chance that even this day there shall a straight
account be asked of thee how thou have spent the time which has been given
thee for to do thy penance in.

Thy life is in the same danger that the sheep life is in, which is in the
wolves mouth, and all the help thou have, is to bleate for Christ the true
sheepherd, except thou will straight ways be swalowed up by death. Do not
promise unto thy self any long life. The wysema^ says, Eccl. 2.
An unjust promise has undone many that have put trust therein. Act. 1.
Do not ye know how our lord says, That the father has put all time in his
sons power God has not put the time into thy power but into his. The prophet
says in the psalm. The time is for thee to work (O lord) for they have
destroyed thy law. Psa. 118.
Except thou do use well this time, God will shorten the days of thy life. At
Noes time God granted unto man, Gene. 6.
an hundred and twenty years to do his penance in, but because he used the
time that he gave him so evil, at the fludd he cut twenty of them clean away.

So shall thou be cut of quickelie to, if thou use thy time evil.

The health of the body is gotten by little, and little, because it is not of
any necessity that health should comme upon a sodeyn unto any man: But the
health of the soul, which is a thing of necessity unto man, may be gotten at
an instant, and of the time thou have but only an instant, which shall yet
suffice thee for thy conversion unto God.

Defer not thou thy penance for many years, since it is gods will that thou
should be converted in a moment. Prolonge not that work, which God would
have done, lest there may happen some impediment to thee, that may keep the
altogether from the doing of it. Tarry not until to morrow, for it may be, he
will call to day for an account. Be diligent then, to do well, since thou
art so near unto death. This life was given thee to the end, that with these
troubles thou might buy eternal rest.

He that takes any work to do in haste, and binds him self to the doing
of it by a certain day, he dispatcheth his hands of all other business, until
that which he has undertaken be done, for the keeping of his credit.

The time of this present life our Savior calls the day in which we have to
work, John. 9.
for when the night of our death does once come on, there can no man work any
longer, he can then neither gain, neither loose: This life is the time that
thou receauedst of God to merit the other in. Have thine eye unto this work,
which is now in thine hand, and if the world call on thee, and would have
thee go about any other work, thou must not harken thereunto: and if it bid
thee forsake this work, and take his work in hand, promising thee for thy
labor, honors, riches, and pleasures: tell him again that thou can not, for
thou know not when the time of thy life shall have an end. Make have and
leave not one jot of thy business to do, because the time draws on in which
thy life shall be examined, and according to thy work shalt thou receive thy
payment.

The falcons toward night be greedy, and labor hard to get their pr^ye, for
that the time of proyeng is paste with them when night comes. Thou must
remember also, that the time of thy working here is but short, and that it is
meet for thee to use all careful diligence to get heaven, by sighing,
sorowing, and praying, and all the means that thou can use.

There be very many that do but little consider, that the days of our penance
do pass away a pace, neither do bethink them that the time of their
salvation slippeth even through their fingers. A wonderful thing it is to see
any man so necligente, going in such have toward his grave.

If thou be necligent in seeking the salvation of thy soul, thou may hap to
be handled as that Leuite was, Judge. 19.
which at the intercession of his father in law departed late to his house, and
not coming home in due time, was by means thereof greeuouslie abused and
iniuried. Thou owghtest straight way to do thy pe^nance, and not harken to any
that would withhold thee, or deteyne thee: lest when thou art goinge onward in
thy way, thou be overtaken with the dark night of death, and then thou be
forced to take up thy lodging in hell, and so can not come at all to rest
thee in thine own lodginge, which is heaven, toward which thou were walkinge.

Get thee therefore about thy business betyme, and do thy penance here,
whilst thou have time and place, that thou may after rest at ease in thine
own house, and not be taken tardie by the way as thou art goinge.

A MAN OVVGHT TO Convert him self to God, and to do penance, while he is in
health, and not differ the doing of yt until the hour of death, for at
that time penance is many times unprofitable. CHAP. 39.
THIS is the time that is acceptable to God: 1. Cor. 6.
these be the days of salvation: In all things let us behave our selves as
the servants of God, in much patience in tribulation, necessities, and
afflictions: This said the Apostle to the Corinthians. In the time therefore of
thine health and best lust, turn thy self unto God: for when the great
floodds of water do compass thee about on every side, that is to say, Psalm.
31.
when the storms of great sorrows shall come upon thee, and the fear of
death be present with thee, thou shall not for fear be able to make thy
conversion perfect. The prophet says, They that have in their life time gone
far of, from God, shall not at their death, draw near unto him.

And the Prophet Isay says, In the time that was acceptable to me, Esa. 49.
I have heard thee, and in the time that thou wast to work thy salvation in, I
have given thee my help. The time of workinge of thy salvation, is here in the
state of this present life: Which time thou must not let pass away from
thee: for though it be short, yet may thou merit eternal rest thereby:
every thing has his time. There is a time to laughe, Eccl. 3.
and a time to weep. The time of wepinge and doing of penance, is here in
this life: The time of joy comes after this life, which thou do seek
after: and co^tritio^ of thy sins which thou know to be a thing so
necessary to get thy salvation by, proceeds from the love of God, which thou
may not well look for at the hour of thy death, if thou have offended God
all the time of thy life. Allthoughe that a man at that time, do weep never so
much, it is to be thought, that he does it rather for the fear of hell, then
for the love of God: which fear is not enough to justify a sinner, and
therefore is penna^ce at that time for the most part unprofitable. He that
loved not God, when he had his own free disposition of him self to love him:
much less will he love bym, when he is in great sorrow and affliction, and
has the fear of death and hell stille present with him.

The passions of melancholy do more strongelie work in the mind of a man,
then do those which do come of any pleasant or delectable cause. Now if a
short delectation does hinder the use of reason, much more will then an extreme
sorrow confound the judgment: and amongst all other sorrows, the sorrow of
death is most strong and terrible, the fear whereof will so darken reason
within thee, that thou shall not then turn thee unto God, when thou have
served the world all thy life before. Thine understanding can never behold two
obiectes perfectly at one time, and then shall sorrow so make thee to shake and
to tremble, that thou shall scarce once lift up thine heart to God. Eccl. 8.


The wiseman says, It is not in man's power to retain his spirit within him,
neither has he the day of his death in his own hands. The habit or custom
of a thing, is such a kind of quality, as hardly is put away from a man. And
then shall thine evil custom draw thee on the one side, and grievous
temptations shall move thee on the other side, and then shall thine aduersarye
be most busy about thee, knowing well that if he loose thee at that time, he
is never like to lay hold on thee again. And therefore makes he his fiersest
assaults at that time, so as those whom he has often given over in their life
time, he has sought earnestly to win again at the hour of their death:
whom if he do gain then, he is ^uer of the^ for ever after. And such kind
of of temptations seemed in co^paraison nothing at all.

And if thou could not in the time of thy best health and strength, resist
his small temptations: how will thou being weak and feeble, withstand so
fearce and grievous temptations? What hope may thou have of winning, when
thy self art most weak, and thine enemy most strong? When thou art in
health and in good state of body will thou refuse to enter into the field
against thine enemy, and after comme to offer thy self into the listes
against him, being all feeble, and full of sorrow and heaviness?

Now, since thou know not but that thou may be brought into that case to
morrow, follow my council, and straight ways without delay, go about to do
penance, and to be sorry for thy sins. King David said to God him self: In
death who shall remember thee (O lord*) He answers again saying. He that
lives shall confess and praise thee (O lord:) not he that is dyeng, but he
that is living shall remember thee (O my God. Eccl. 12.
) Hear what the wyseman says: Remember thy creator in the time of thy yowth,
before that the son of thine understanding be darkened, and the stars of
thy senses be decayed.

It seems often, that such men's penance is but false and feigned, for that
they be seen soon after their recovery, to return to those faults, which
they were accustomed to before: And to revenge them of such injuries and
offenses as they have pardoned and forgyuen before. And if the intent of their
penance had been perfect and good, they would never have returned so easelie to
their evil customs again. Necessity inforceth such unto virtue. If thou
forsake not sin, until thou can sin no longer, then does sin forsake
thee, and not thou yt.

When the merchant throws his goods over board into the Sea, he throws them
away of necessity to save him self: but when the storm is past, he seeks
how to get his goods again: Neither would he ever have cast them away if he
had not been inda^gered by the^. Suc^ kind of noble liberality, have those men
been likewise constrained to use at their death: who have had their heart in
servile subjection unto the world all their whole life.

It seems a thing half impossible, that a worldly man standinge upon the
point to dye, should more think upon God, the^ upon hell. If thou have
Judgment, thou will soon perceive the error wherein thou live by
prolonging of thy penance.

Amongst all vanities, that is one of the greatest, to differ penance unto
the vearie last hour: And he that does not his penance forthwith does put it
of, unto the last hour, for what knows he, but that his last hour may be
before to morrow come. And since thou know not whether thou shall live until
to morrow or no* thine hour being ^o uncertain, turn thee betyme to
amendment of thy life, lest by deferring of yt until the end, thou may be
sodeinlie taken with death when thou would seek for time and place to do
thy penance in, and can after find none.

A DISCOVRSE HOW NO man ought in this life to put trust in any worldly
thing, shevvinge that there is no assurance or stabilitie in any worldly
thing, but all things in this world are unstable, and full of vanity. CHAP.
40.
Psalm. 145.
PVT not thy trust in Princes, nor in the sons of men* for there is no safety
to be found in them, says the prophet: In no lyuelie creature, nor noble
parentage, or other dignity owghtest thou to put any trust, unless thou will
be deceived, troubled, and disquieted, for all is full of vanity.

Wherein trustest thou, o thou worldly man? Trust not in thy great force,
since there have been so many valiant captains in the world, of whom we have
now scarce any memory left to us. The scripture says: That the mighty men,
Sap. 6.
shall suffer mighty punishment. Vaunte not thy self in the vanity of thy
great acts, and worthy deeds done by thee.

It is a vearie folly, (thy life being so short as it is) to make stately
palaces, when as our forefathers lived many years in simple and mean cotages.
Iheremy says, Iher. 2.
woe be unto him that builds his house upon unrighteousness.

Esteem not of thy horses well set out and furnished, Amos. 6.
nor the vain pompes of this world, since God says, woe be unto you that be
rich in Syon, and do put your trust upon the hill of Samari^, and do enter
so gloriously into the house of Israel.

Set not your hearts upon banqueting and feastinge, as many vain folk do,
which do spend their days therein, and have no regard to the sentence that
God pronounced upon Balthazar king of Babylon, nor remembers not his words,
Dan. 5.
saying, woe be unto you that rise up early to eat and drink, and to have
pleasant music in your howses, and have no regard unto the works of our
Lord.

Trust not upon the nobility of thy kindered nor in the vanity of thy bodelie
beauty, since it is written: All outward grace, vanity and beauty, are
deceytefull. Do not put any confidence in the nimblenes and agilitie of thy
body, nor in any other external thing, for in these things, the vearie
brute beasts do go beyond thee, and exceed thee.

2. Re. 2.
Asael, which ran like unto a wild dear of the wood, was slain in the
following of Abner: And these outward graces and qualities of the body, have
been to many men cause of their destruction and death.

Make not any great account of thy learning and knowledge, for since no man
living is comparable therein with the vearie devils them selves: who for all
that their knowledge, cannot deliver them selves from the pains of hell. In
nothing of this miserable world, do thou put any trust, for all is vanity and
vearie mere folly.

It is a great want of wisdom, to give judgment before thou do hear both
parties: And if thou do reckon all these wordlie things for good, why
think not thou the things pertenynge to God, to be as good? Worldly men
do give their sentence in favor of the world, approuinge and esteemynge much
of the mucke of this earth, because they never hard that part which longs
to the spirit, once speak on gods behalf. They think the world to be good,
neither hearing nor seeinge any thing for gods part. Saint Paul said, If
thou did: taste the sweetenes of the spirit, Rom 8.
thou would abhor all fleshly taste. And if thou did but taste likewise
of God, thou would condemn, and utterly defy all the sin and the
vanity in the which thou have been content to lead thy life hitherto: And
because thou know not the taste of gods dayntie meats nor of his fauorie
food, thou take liking in the bitter and harsh taste of this miserable world.

Despise these vanities, and put thou no trust in the lyeng, nor in the
deceipte of this present world, that thou may get the eternal and true
joys of heaven.

The end of the first part.
OF THE CONTEMnynge of the vanities of the world. The second part. Wherein
is contained how perverse the worldly customs are.
He shows first the world to be full of deceipte, false shows, and lyeng:
and how it is enemy to all that love it, lading all those that do esteem it,
with infinite miseries and calamitie^. CHAP. 1.
1 Io. 1.
DO not love the world, neither the things that be of the world says Saint
John. He that knows not the malice of any thing, lives in so much more
security, as he fears less the harms that thereby may come unto him.
Therefore it is meet that thou sholdest know the conditions of the world, to
the end that when thou know it, thou may the better beware of it.

The deceytes thereof be vearie manifest and the evil qualities that it has,
cry out to all the world. How little ought that to be esteemed, which gives
poyso^ to all those that enter into amity with it: And all those that do
join them selves unto yt, it infecteth with contagious pestilence. How many
does it deceive, and how many infinite people, does it make quite blind? When
it flies away it is nothing, when it is seen it is but a shadow, and when it
ascends upward it is but a smoke.

Unto fools it is sweet, and to them that be wise and discreet, it is vearie
bitter. They that do love it, know not what it is: And they that do hate it,
do see thoroughly into it. To know it well as it ought to be known, one must
stand far of from it, for they that draw to near unto it, neither do know
it, nor the^ selves.

It brings forth much mischief, and is cause of infinite miseries. It
blinds those that draw near unto it, and unto him that is not well ware of
yt, it mynystreth matter of much heavy care.

It hates those that do love it: It deceyueth those that do trust it: It
persecuteth those that do serve yt: It afflicts those that be friends unto
it: It does shame to those that do honor it: And it forgets those that be
myndefull of yt. More cause have we to hate it when it most loves us, then
when it openly persecuteth us.

The more familier that it is: the more dangerous: And much worse is it, when
it fawneth upon us, then when yt flies away from us. Either must we laughe at
the world, or the world laughe at us: And they that contemn not the world,
shall be contemned of the world.

VVoe be unto them that do trust it, and happy be they that do despise i^: It
is both to be feared, and to be fled from. The life thereof is deceytfull, the
trauayll unprofitable, the fear continual, and the honor most perilous. The
beginning without prudence, and the end without repentance. It promyseth
liberally: It perfourmeth slowly: and an impossible thing it is, for a man
that lives to the world, to want either fear, sorrow, trouble, o^ danger.
It draws men into bonds, and never suffers them to be at rest, and gladly
would give them all there have. He that trusts it too much, is but a fool:
It is impossible to love it, and not to run headlonge into danger by the
loving of it.

What can thou desire in the world, that is not full of uncleanness? At
every step it is ready to change, and by often changing, it declares it
self to be corruptible. It is desirous to have all me^ catch after the false
pleasures thereof, and as soon as they have begone a little to taste of them,
it laugheth the^ all to sco^^^* The fruit that it offreth to the folowers
thereof is vearie fair, and pleasant to the show, but when they come to the
opening of it, they shall find nothing within i^ but worms and foul
stinkinge savors. The glory thereof is so fickle, that it forsakes them that
be living, and never follows those that be dead.

In the promyses that the world makes, is falsehood and disceyte: In the
conversation thereof, is lothsumnes: In mirth heaviness: his pleasures breed
remorse: his comfortes bring scrupulositie: and his prosperities breed
doubtefulnes. In it, there is neither stabilitie nor assurance. It has nothing
but a show, and an appearance of good, and a false flourish of fond affection,
with which it deceyueth the simple that know it not, who being once entered
within the goulfe of his bitter waters, (which they take to be sweet,) they
are plunged and drowned in the bottomless Sea of perdition, being beaten down
with the waves of his stormy tempests.

I do therefore here advise you, that when the world, like a crafty merchant
does offer to show you a vearie fine cloth to the sale, you be not too hasty
to bestow your money on it, until you have vewed the cloth all throughout, for
his manner is to present you with that which is fair and fine in the first
unfolding, but after being laid all forth to the eye, It appears playnlie
to be vearie course and stark naught. Such sl^pper parts does the world daily
play with us, in uttering to us false ware for good and true stuff. There be
many that for a shadow of honor, or some pleasure which the world does offer
them, do buy in deed much shame and dishonor, and some sorrow and troubles
withal, and have paid so dearly for that false ware, that they have thereby
made them selves slaves and bondmen unto the world. They think that every
thing is as good as it bears show for, and that the whole pack of cloth is
as good within, as it makes show on the out side.

But beware lest that the world do deceive thee: stop thine ears when it
begins to speak unto thee: sleep not at the sound of his melody, for it
is like unto the mairemayds music, which with her sweet songs does seek to
draw thee on the rocks, and cast thy soul and body away for ever.

IT BEHOOVES THEE TO BE wise and wary, in knovvinge of the deceyts of the
world, lest thou be taken by the false shows thereof. CHAP. 2.
Colo. 2.
BEVVARE that you be not taken with false deceytes: says the Apostle. He which
lives in this false world, has great need continnually to take heed that he
be not deceived by it. Thou had need to go very warelie and well
provided, if thou will avoid falling. It has this condition with it to
enterteyne men, and delight them with the outward show, that there may be no
regard had unto the inward parts thereof.

It setteh out all his pleasures and delights unto the sensual part of man,
that the filth which is within may not be perceived. Unto the covetous man it
shows only the glorious glitteringe of gold, but it shows not withal,
the cares that rich men have, both in the gettinge and keeping of their
riches. It inuiteh us unto honorable roumes and dignities in the world, but it
concealeth the troubles which commonly do accompany great men.

Our adversary the devil never brought our savior to the sanctuary which
was in the inward part of the temple, Mat. 4.
but he led him up to the pynnacle, which was a little round tower, made in
the top of the Church, rather for pleasure to look abroad, and for some
ornamente sake, then for any necessytie thereof at all.

The devil and the world do never use to draw men unto them, by putting any
remorce into their consciences, or by inuiting them to the perfect knowledge of
them selves, but by the daselinge of their eyes with the bewtifull shows of
vain exterior and superfluous things. To outward things it inuiteth thee
willingly, but unto inward things nothing at all. God commanded that the
bestes which should be offered unto him in sacrifice* Exo 3. Leu. 1.
should have their skins first taken of from them: But contrary the world
will that all the service which thou off^est unto it, should be covered with the
couerings, as it were skinnnes of pleasures, honor, and commodity, to the
intent that the interior parts of malignitie and vice which is within may not
be seen: therefore must thou do as God has commanded thee, which is to take
of the outward skins of delight, that thou may perfectly behold the
deceytes, the scruples, and filthiness which lie hidden under those external
things which the world offreth thee. Truly all thy harm proceeds of this,
that thou do not take away the outward bark from sin. But if thou will
once take hold of the out side, and look well into it, and consider the
inward part of sin, thou shall find much falsehoode hidden within, and thou
shall know the vanity and the mischief of that which thou do now esteem
so much.

Behold the deceyte wherein thou lyuest by gyuing credit unto the world: thou
shall see how great things seemed unto thee but little, and how thou
esteemedst very dearly things of vile account* God him self being infinite
great, thou accomptest but little, because thou (...) far of from him: and
the smallest things of the world unto thee seem great, because that thy
love and affection has joined thee unto them, which S. Paul the holy Apostle
esteemed but as filthy mire. Phi. 4.


The lovers and friends of God, because they were full of divine light, knew
well the deceytes of the world. If thou would but sometime consider with thy
self, what time thou spendest about these worldly things, and how little time
they shall continue with thee, and then reckon withal what pains and travail
thou have bestowed about them: it cold not be ^ut that thou would with great
care and diligence look well about thee, and walk from thence forth more
advisedly in thy ^ourney.

Thou must stand long about the be^olding of the vanities and pleasures of ^he
world, lest the pleasant and gorgeous ^hewes thereof, so glitter in thine eyes
to ^ake thee blind, that it bring thee there^y at the last unto destruction.
There is nothing in thine understanding, but that was before in thy senses: and
when thine understanding comes to drink at the ^esterne of thy senses, the
world plays ^acobs part, Gene. 30.
and sticks there down cer^ayne white populer tree wandes, of fair ^leasant
delights to beguyle thee withal, and to infecte thereby thine understanding.

The honors and delights of this world ^e but like unto flowers, that soon
fade and are gone: and do not thou think, that in the world which thou see
with thine eyes, there is any fruit or commodity, it is all but vain
fruitles leaves (...) the populer tree, which never bear fruit^ at all. Those
fruiteles vanities does the world offer unto thy senses, and although^ thine
understanding be well purged, yo^ will thy senses earnestly labor to spo^^
(...) and defile it again. And as a fair looking glass does easily by often
lookinge in (...) gather spots: so does our understanding by evil
imaginations gather errors. Genesis 39.
And when our understanding is watered at the ^enses with earnest imaginations
of vani^^ies and disceytes which the world offered ^s, It begins to conceive,
as Iacob^ ^heepe did, spotted lambs which be ou^ ^orldlie desires, which
bring fo^^^ ^ft^rward unjust works.

Do not thou therefore behold, (...) set thine eyes upon such variety of
^^^^ginations as the world does make show (...) unto thee, for it is but an
exterior app^^^rance, without any sound substance^ deceyueth them that are
delighted (...) it, as little children are deceived with^^ candle that is
lighted, which when the see and earnestly behold, they will (...) their
fingers into it, until they have b^^^ned them in the flame, And then they
(...) out, and no body can still them: Eue^^ are worldly men without
judgment (...) understanding deceived with the ap^^^rance of worldly beauty,
casting th^^^selues into the fiery flame of the vices and foul sins
thereof, findinge their hands empty, and their consciences burnte.

THERE IS NO CREDIT TO be given to the world in any thing, for all the fair
show that it makes, tends but to falsehood, and feigned flattery, which
do dravve a man from God, and do throvv him down headlong into the depth of
all miseries. CHAP. 3.
HE does faynedly humbl^ him self, Eccl. 19.
and his inward parts be full of deceyte: says the wise man. Do not
believe that which the world does ^ell thee, nor do not thou think, that it
^eareth any perfect good will unto thee: under the color of good wholesome
victu^ll, it gives unto thee poison to destroy ^hee.

Do not thou give any trust unto the world, neither believe it to be thy
friend, ^or if thou do give it credit, and com^it thy self into his hands,
it will do ^y thee, as Ioab, the chief captain of ^auid, did by Amazias, 2.
Reg. 3.
who embraced him friendly in his arms and kissed him, and secretly the while
did kill him with his dagger. Let it say unto thee what it will, let it give
thee the counsel that shall best like thee for the time, yet shalt thou
find all false and full of lies, what so ever it has told thee. There were
no less then four hundredth false prophets which flattered Achab, 3. Re. 22.
promising him both life and victory, if he should go to the war: And all
this was but to please his fantasy, and satisfy his mind. All that the
world does advise thee to, and what so ever thy false appetites do give thee
counsel to, be but mere deceytes to abuse thee withal. They would have thee to
think by their false persuasions, that in living after their counsel, and
contynuyng the evil trade that thou art entered into, thou shall have a solemn
victory here, live in triumph in this world, end thy days in peace, and
after enjoy the life everlasting.

But if thou do believe these lyeng prophets, thou shall die as Achab did
most miserably. But thou must harken unto the Prophet Micheas, (which must be
thine own conscience) it is that which must tell thee the truth, and
discover unto thee all their false lyeng and deceytes. But thou have no liking
to give any ear thereunto, no more then Achab had unto Micheas, because he
told him that which was not agreeable to his own appetite: And thou have no
regard unto thine own conscience, because it tells thee nothing but the
truth which thou art not willing to know. It seeks thy profit, but thou have
no delight to hear thereof. Thou had rather go out of thy way by following
of liers, to the loss of thy life: 1. Reg. 21.
then to do well with the prophet of God, and live without deceyts. Thou
folowest the world, and thine own appetites, and so go forth to the
battle, and there art overthrown, and loosest thy life. These be also those
false witnesses which Iesabel brought forth, who (because they be believed) do
kill thy soul. Give no ear unto their lyenge, except thou mean to be taken
captyue in the nets of their false deceytes.

All the fair words of this world, be but false fictions to deceive thee,
and to take thee unprovided. Allthoughe that for the present time, it shows a
friendly face, yet in time of necessity, thou shall find a bitter enemy of
it. It will do by thee as quicksiluer does by gold, which allthough it be
never so fast joined unto yt, as soon as it comes to the fire, it goes
straight away from it, and forsakes it. And so will this world play by thee
when thou come into any strayte, and that the fire of tribulation begins
to catch hold of thee, it will straight way forsake thee, And then shall thou
easelie see what all the vain glory of the world is, that does so sodaynlie
fail thee. The friendship that the world shows thee, is but of purpose with
his fair shows and good countenance to deceive thee. And allthoughe it
pretend thy good never so much for the time, it seeks but thereby occasion
the better to overthrow thee.

Drink not thou of the sweet milk of his deceytes, neither seek thou to
sleep in the confidence of his friendship, unless thou will perish, and dye
an evil death, as Sisara did, who committing trust unto Iahell, Iud. 4.
and feedinge of her dayntie fare, was miserably put unto death by her.

God says, O my people, they which do say unto thee, Esa. 4.
thou art happy: be they which do deceive thee. If the world will bid thee
unto a feast, and tell thee that those honors, riches, and pleasures which it
profereth thee, and sets before thee, be very good and sauory meat for thee
to feed upon: 3. Reg. 13.
yet do not thou believe it, except thou will dye an evil death, as that
prophet did, which for the gyuing of over light credit unto the words of a
false prophet, was killed with a lion going by the way. Although it say unto
thee, that God commands it, and that there is no sin at all in it: never
yet make thou any account of his words, for although it be true; that there
is no sin to live in high degree and stately honor, yet do they live in
great danger of fallinge into the foul sin of pride, which do live in the
prosperity and ioli^ie of the world.

The world seems goodly and fair to the eye, being in deed foul and
filthy, like an image made of a piece of wood, which is set out well, and
fair painted to the sight, and within is there nothing but a piece of old
rotten timber.

The fisher uses to cover his hooks with bayte, to catch and kill his fish
withal. All this worldly flattering is but to do thee harm with all: And
under the green grass does the serpent lurk, and hyde her self.

The woman mentioned in the Apocalips, Apo. 17.
gave poison to drink in a cup of gold. O how many has the world slain
with the poison of his deceytes? And how many do drink their own death out
of the cup of honors, riches, and vanity? with this golden cup he
deceyueth the simple, which know not the poison that is contained therein: fly
from his deceytes if thou will escape death.

THE FALSE PROMYSES OF the world are not to be trusted unto, for it gives the
clean contrary of that which in show it pretends. CHAP. 4.
MANY have been cast away through unjust promyses, Eccl. 26.
says Ecclesiasticus. Let every man be well examyned, and let them declare
the truth of their own knowledge, and they will say that in all their life
they never saw joy without some sorrow, Peace without discord, Rest without
fear, Health whithout infirmity, nor mirth without mourning.

The world makes still his promyses of all good and prosperous things, but in
perfourmance they prove all contrary. It promyseth joy, but it comes
accompanied with sorrow: It promyseth to abide still with thee, but when thou
have most need of his help, it will be furthest from thee. It promyseth
quyetnes, and it gives perturbations and troubles: It promyseth mirth, and
perfourmeth mourning: And when it promyseth honor, it brings shame:
Finally it promyseth long life, when their follows a short life, and a
miserable, and subject to much evil. That life which it promyseth, rather
seems a life, then is in deed a true life.

To some it makes a show of a long life, for to deceive them in the end. It
shortneth again the lives of some others, to the end that though they would
convert them to God, yet shall they have no time thereunto.

To others it promyseth length of life, because they should do what they
listed, and be made worse thereby. And unto other it sends a short life,
that they should have no time to do good. All these does it deceive, depryuing
them of the knowledge which they ought to have of God, of the world, and of
them selves.

Jacob served Laban seven years to have his daughter Rachell to his wife,
Gene. 29
but his deceytfull father in law, in the dark night gave him Lia to wife. So
plays the world with thee: It promises thee one thing, and intends an
other.

These worldly men do never take knowledge of these things, until the
morning come and that the darkness of this present life be passed away and
gone: that is, until death do come, which does open the eyes of our
understanding, and makes us to behold the falsehood of the world, as Jacob in
the morning perceived the guyle of his false father in law. Then shall they
perceive the bitter end, that the honors and pleasures of this world do
bring with them, and then shall they see, how much time they have lost in the
service of this false lyeng world.

Many althowgh, they see well enough the falsehood of the world, yet are they
contented to be deceived thereby: As Baala^ did who fell down at noone days
when his eyes were open. Number. 22.
The three fre^des of Job, Job. 2.
drew near unto him like friends to give, him comfort at the first, but
afterward they iniuried him, and gave him many foul words of reproach. So
does the world draw near unto thee at the first with fair words like a
friend, but afterward thou shall well perceive him to be an hard adversary
against thee. It comes flatteringe with pleasant speeches unto thee, to offer
thee friendship, but shortly after y^ becomes thy cruel enemy.

Let not his sweet words enter within thine ears, for thou shall shortly
after find a foul change: yet are there many for all that which do give it
credit, and hold all that for true that it tells them: and by believing his
false promises they defer their penance, persuading them selves that they
shall live many years, and then comes he suddenly and takes their life away
from them.

They live so carelessly, and upon such trust of those false promises, as
though they were very sure that the world told them nothing but truth. But
thou must not believe his words, nor what so ever it shall tell thee, for thou
shalt find in the end that all his promises are false.

THE MEMORY OF THEM that have despised the world continues: but of those
that have been lovers of the world, the remembrance is soon gone away.
CHAP. 5.
THE memory of these wicked worldly folk perishes like the sound of a voice
in the air, Psalm. 9.
says the prophet. Make not any account of this world* who soon forgets
his friends, and of his enemies keeps a perpetual memory.

If thou will that the world shall have thee still in remembrance, thou must
despise it, and so it will remember thee. And who be they (think you) that the
world remembers most? Good S. Hierome, and others like unto him, that fled
from all the pleasures of this world, and lived alone in deserts. Of these
who were enemies unto it, and set nothing at all by it, the world has yet as
fresh a memory as if they were living still. That is most true which the holy
prophet tells: Psalm. 111.
The just man shall be had in memory for ever. The world has yet in good
memory S. Paul the heremite, that was fast shut up in a cave ninety years
together.

Whom has Rome cheefely in remembrance at this day? Not the famous princes
and great men which flourished so much there, but the poor fisher S. Peter,
whom the world despised, and made no reckening of. The kings and emperors of
the world, do adore and have in reverence those most of all, that fled from
and forsook those great honors and riches which them selves do live in.

They be more honored of the world which do hate it, then they which do
esteem it. They which hate the world, those does God love: and they that
forsake the world, God receives: and he honoreth those that despise it, and
here in the world does he make also an everlasting memory of them.

It is a notable thing that the seruante of God, living in a cave, far from
the company of men, should have his glory manifested throughout all the world,
by God his own holy appointment. There had never such memory been made in the
world of S. Marie the Egyptia^, if she had remained still in the world, and
never had gone into the wilderness at all. If she had served the world, she
had been forgotten long ago: but flyeng from the world, God had care of her
to make her glory known: and published over all the world the honor of her
who lived always hidden in a hole. She gained more by flyeng from it, the^
ever she could have done, by being her self present in it.

O how much are we deceived, who by our seekinge of honor do loose it, by
desyring to have our name kept in perpetual memory, we are quickelie
forgotten: And having a will to be great, we are brought to be low, and of
little acco^pte: And the things which we do take to preserve us, be made the
means to undo us, and to overthrow us: And ever we loose, where we do
think to gayn.

O what folly is this of ours, and what terrible blindenes, to desire still
such greatness in this world, seeing before our eyes, those only to be great in
the world, which desired to be little and of no account. We would that men
should remember us, and we are straighte ways forgotten: there is none so much
honored in deed as he that flies from honor.

No man is more rich, then he that is contented with a little: No man so
great as he that seeks to be little: And none so soon forgotten, as he that
desires to be had in remembrance of the world. And all those of whom the
world makes so much feast, and so much joyful memory, I see and find, that
they were all enemies unto the world.

Mathathias said unto his sons, give your lives for the testament of your
fathers, and remember the works that they wrought in their generations, and
you shall get great glory and a name for ever. The providence of God has so
ordained that there should be a perpetual memory made of the enemies of the
world, and that the friends thereof, should be forgotten.

The Gospel in rehearsing of the genealogy of Christ, Mat. 1.
leaves out the memory of Iesabell unto the fourth generation: Allthoughe it
had fitly served the turn to have brought it in. The memory of Amaleck God
clean took away from the earth, Exo. 17.
but the memory of the just shall remain with our Lord for ever: And the
memo^^e of worldly men shall perish with the world.

It is a foul vanity to offend God, for the leauinge of a memory behind
thee in this miserable world: If thou do desire a memory to be had of thee,
thou shall be sure to loose it. And because the world is so forgetful of his
friends, put all thy trust in God, who is a most faithful and ^uer friend.

THE WORLD EXALTS his friends while they do live, but when their life is
ended, time takes away all the memory of them, as though there had been none
such. CHAP. 6.
JOB says of worldly folk, that the memory of them should be likened unto
ashes. Job. 13.
The wind never cease to blow in this life, which does scatter the ashes,
that is the fame and the memory that worldly men do seek in this world.
The Prophet says: They are like unto duste, which the wind blows up from
the earth. Psalm. 1.
The vanity of men is great, who knowing that they shall be converted into
ashes, which the wind of this world does soon blow away, do yet think that
their memory may continue long in the world. And although it were so that the
memory of thee should never perish here, what were thou the better if thou
sholdest remain continually in hell* would that deliver the thence, or deminish
thy pain there*

It is a great vanity for thee to desire to be had in memory of the world,
if thou haste a spotted conscience: and a very vain desire it is of any man to
fly abroad in the mouths of men. How much so ever thou art desirous to be
praised of men, and to have thy memory preserved, yet must not thou look to be
better remembered then those that are passed out of this world before thee. The
world is contented for the time present here, to give some show and
signification of his favor, but as soon as one is gone hence, he is
forgotten, as though he had never been.

Prou. 10.
The memory of the just man shall be with praise, says the wise man: but the
wicked man's memory shall soon perish. And of the good men shall there be a
sweet mention made, Eccl. 49.
according as Ecclesiasticus said of king Josias: The memory of Josias
shall be sweet in every man^ mouth.

The memory of all worldly folk comes soon to an end, and vanishes away.
What is now become of all the honors, riches, and possessions of worldly men?
where is all the beauty of this world? the men be gone and all that longed to
them, and time has clean consumed the memory of them: all their goodly great
palaces are made even with the ground: their costly toumbes wherein their
bodies lay be all defaced, and no monument left behind, so much as of the
place where they were.

Our life passes away like a flower, and the delights thereof be short, and
that which the world yeldeth us here, is dearly paid for again: the
pleasures thereof be but for a short time, but the sorrows be perpetual. The
glory and delight of this world is but a pufte: but the torments that follow
thereof, be without end: many do never think of them, until they fall upon
their backs, and with a vearie little pleasure, they buy a great deal of
pain and travail. And for the mainteyninge of a little honor here, what
infinite torments are sustained, which for all that, whithin a little while
after vanishes away like a smoke, and they are forgotten as though that they
had never been. To this point comes at the last, all that peuish praise which
is so greedelie sought for by men in this world.

How many notable learned men has there been in this world, whose learning
was followed with great affection of men, and were therefore called into great
dignity and honor here, of whom yet at this day, there is no memory left,
no not so much as their names known. Their life was but short, with death it
had end, and straight ways they were forgotten for ever. What is become of so
many Princes, kings and great estates, and all their great port and
Princely Majesty? their friendship, riches, and Iolitie? What is become of
all this gear now? There is now no memory left thereof: It is passed like a
shadow, and as though it had never been.

How many have we known, and been famylier withal, and in whose company we
have been full merry together, that now do lie full low under our feet, and
are almost forgotten, as though they had never been? 2* Re. 1.
They are all dead, they shall not return unto us again, but we shall
rather go unto the^. They were pilgrims and strangers here on the earth, as
we are now. All that they had, they have left behind them, and so shall we
do also. They are gone and passed away like a shadow, and so shall we pass
away also. O how soon each thing passes away. There is scarcely any memory
left of any of the great me^ of the world: every thing is consumed by time. God
is he that only is stable and permanent: all other things, as friends,
companyons, pleasures, and pastimes, have soon an end. All these do soon
fail, and within a while shall one of us be separated from another. And the
time is not long to, in which we shall be eaten up by worms, and turned into
dust and ashes.

Each thing passes and consumes away with time. It is vearie vanity to
esteem of these soon slidinge things of the world, as if they should have any
long continuance here. Shall we happily be better remembered, then those that
are gone hence before us? Are we better then they?

It were suerlie small wisdom for any of us to think, that there should any
better memory be made of us, then of those that are gone hence before us. Open
then thine eyes, thou that put thy confidence in the world: And behold both
greater, richer, and more noble then thou art, of whom there is not now any
memory left.

It is vanity then, to make any account of the memory of this transitory
world. Every thing has an end: Every thing passes away with time: every
thing hasteneth toward his end, and tends toward his consummation: and
every thing is full of vanity and corruption. The love of God is that which
only lasts and endures for ever, for the glory of this world endures but
for a blast

HOW GOOD AND Dilligent service so ever a man does unto the world, yet does
the world never remember it, neither will it know hy^ that served it: But
will call well to mind, and have in remembrance, th^se that misused, and
evil entreated it. CHAP. 7.
THE fool knows nothing* says the wise man: Psalm. 91.
the wordlie men travail to get the honor of this world, which when it has
forsaken them again, it will scarseli^ know them.

1. Re. 25.
A great friend was David to Naball, and much had he done for him in the time of
his good estate: But when David was after fallen into necessity, he would not
so much as know him: But answered David's servants when they came unto him,
who is David? Or who is Isais son* Shall I bestow my sheep and my goods
upon one whom I know not?

Many a day had David conuersed before with Naball, whereof he was now so
forgetful, that he asked who he was. Naball signifies as much as fool, as
the story tells, and it is a very plain figure ^f this vain and foolish
world, which is ^ubiect to so much vanity and mutability. ^or after much
labor bestowed in the ser^ice of the world, by the faithful ser^antes and
folowers thereof, when they ^ooke again for any reward of their ser^ice: it
refuses quite the knowledge of them, and plainly says that it knows them
not. They bestow great travail in ^he service of it, both day and night, and
^et must forgetfulness be all their reward ^t the last.

This unthankful world is like unto an inn keeper, whom his geste goes
about to take acquaintance of, telling him that he has been long his gest, and
has ^odged many a night in his house: but he ^efuseth his acquaintance, and
tells him ^gayne that he knows him not, neither ^an he keep any reckening
of so many as ^oe pass by that way.

Men spend all their time in serving ^he world, and at the last they are
demaun^ed who they be, as though they had never seen them before: we do all
both good and bad pass through this world ^^ke pilgrims and trauaylers, and
commonly most men do use to inuit strangers as they pass by the way: And
even so does the world play by them, he gives them courteous words, and good
enter^eynment to make them delighte in his company, and to serve him
dilligently in ^ll kinds of vanity, and after that he laugheth them to scorn,
and shakes them (...) as though he had never been acquaynt^^ with them before.

It were good for every man to e^^ter into an account with him self, a^^ see
whether he have not bestowed mo^^ upon the world then upon Jesus Christ What
so ever thou haste bestowed upon the world, thou may well think it le^^ for
after a short space being past, tho^ shall find how thou art clean
forgot^^^ and out of mind: and if thou will need^^ be remembered at his hands,
and have i^ to know thee again, thou were best (...) handle it hardly and set
nothing by it. (...) thou beatest thine host well fauored^^ as thou passest by
the way, he will not fo^^get thee again in twenty years after* And that is
all the cause, why the world forgets not good and holy men, which lived
here in the world, because that the set nothing by it, nor cared not for i^*
Those that make much of it, It forgets and remembers only those which
con^temned it: Handle it hardly, and it wi^^ never forget thee. And the less
that tho^ love it, the more shall thou be beloue^ of it. Of his friends it is
forgetful, and (...) faithful folowers will it not know at al^*

O how many have passed through th^^ world with great triumph and honor the
names of whom be scant known (...) this day, neither is there any more
men^tion made of them, then if they had neu^^ ^^ne borne: and no more are they
known (...) the world, then if they had never been (...) the world.

Let all thy care be to love God only ^^d to serve him, for he knows well
all ^^s own sheep whom he means to ^^nducte to his pleasant pastures of
Pa^^dis and everlasting glory.

THIS WORLD IS LIKENED to a tempesteous Sea, in the which our Souls are
tossed and turmoyled with infinite dangers, from the which there is no way
to escape, but by retiring into the harborovvgh of pe^nance. CHAP. 8.
THOSE which sail on the seas, Eccl. 43.
do tell of many dangers that they have passed: says the wise man. The
dangers of the seas be so great and so many, that no man is able to report
them but he that has proved them.

The nauigatio^ which we make through the tempesteous waves of this world, is
so much more dangerous then the other, as it gives greater impedimentes to
the sure rest of our soul which it expects in heaven, then the other does
or can do^* to the obteyning of a sure^porte in earth*

The waters of this world be bitter, so are all worldly consolations. In this
sea, do the great men (like unto great fishes) eat up and deuowre the little:
the waue^ thereof be never at any rest, but always moving and working, unto
the which the servants of the world be always subject, having their hearts
beaten and al to tossed with the heavy thoughts and cares of this world.

The sentence of our savior is most true, Io. 16.
that said. That in the world we should have oppressions, the which by
afflictinge of our hearts should verefie that which the Prophet Esaias says: the
wicked man's heart is like unto the sea, Esa 57.
which works and will never be at rest. Daniell saw in his vision how the
hearts of men be tormented with so many sundry passions, Dan. 7.
as it were with the contrary force and vehemency of so many wyndes.

Cares and riches go still cowpled together, and amongst the honors and
prosperities of this tempesteous world^, does pride and arrogancy of heart
bear a vearie great sway, and dominion: In the which they are first
engendered, and from which they do proceed: and vearie few are their of them,
which lyuinge in continual rest and prosperity do not fall into sin: and
hardly are any of them to be found, which in high degree, and lofty estate
do keep and preserve true humi^^tie of heart.

It is is half a miracle to see a man live (...) the pleasures of this life,
and to be free ^^om sin. And how can a man put all his ^^re upon God, that is
so compassed about ^ith the cares and unquietness which do ^^rowe of these
temporal pleasures in which we live.

Happy is he that does volu^tarilie for^^ke the pleasures of the earth, where
all (...) full of dangers and snares: and happy (...) he* that in this world
seeks to avoid ^ll occasions which may draw him into ^^nne. 3. Re. 19.
He that flies as Elias did into the ^esert of penance, is most likely to
fly from all those dangers, that do lead a ^an unawares into hell.

Learn thou to know the dangers ^f this world, for by the knowing of them
grows the skill to avoid them, and to vanquish them. He that does not fear
them, but boldly incountreth them, is ^ot to be accounted valiant, but rash.
There ^aue heretofore been some perfect men, that have lived in the honor and
wealth of this world, and yet have lived with all in the fear of God, and
served him truly: But there is respect to be had unto the times of the former
age, and this that is now present, and therefore thou must now ^ake an other
trade of life in hand.

When there comes a great calm in the sea, the sailors be in good safety:
but when the storm does come, then they use for their remedy to disburthen
the ship, and to cast their goods into the sea, for saving of them selves.

The sea of this world was well in quyetnes in those days: Gene. 18.
When Abraham, (who was a very rich and welthie man) would with his own
hands wash the feet of those strangers which came unto him: and Sara his
wife did the works of like humility. Our forefathers then were served but
with a few dishes at their tables: they went appareled very meanly: they ryd
but upon simple beasts, and all their riches they used as servants to serve
them: But now that the sea is so swollen, and that malice and sin be so
increased, honor and riches serve now for no other purpose, but to give a color
unto vicious living. All the remedy thou haste now is to despise them, since
that they do so manifestly prejudice thy soul.

There is no man but will be co^tente for the saving of his bodily life, to
forgo all his te^porall goods: but there be but a few, that for the saving of
their souls will despise these false counterfeit goods of the earth. The high
estates and dignities of this world, be no less dangerous to the life of the
soul, in the time of perilous tempests: then the goods and merchandise of
the ship, be dangerous for the lives of them that be in the ship: and is
it not reason the^, (that those same goods, which thou can be contented to
throw away from thee, for the saving of thy bodily life) that thou sholdest
likewise be as well contented to throw away for the saving of the life of thy
soul? Do never prefer temporal and transitory goods, before true and
eternal gooddes. But (because it is natural for every man to fly dangers,)
it is conuenyent, that thou sholdest fly out of the world that is so
dangerous.

In this Sea then where danger is so certain, and salvation so doubtefull:
take this good counsel with thee, lest thou be drowned in the Sea, as king
Pharao was. Exo. 14.
Place thine heart in the land of promise, toward which thou art sailing, and
fly from so many dangers by despising of this world, that so thou may
merit to come unto thy desired port of salvation, where thou shall be certain
to find sure rest and perfect security.

THE FAVORS OF THIS world be but as a shadovv that soo^^ passes away, And
therefore they that do trust in the^ without thinking of their souls
salvation, at the last are likely to rest in the fire of hell. CHAP. 9.
ELIAS lay sleeping under the shadow of a Geneper tree, ^. Re. 19.
having many mighty enemies: (says the scripture:) Trauayling men, do use
to rest them, and to sleep under the shadow of a tree, as they journey by the
way, And when the shadow is passed away and gone, and they begin to wake
again, they find them selves all sweating in the open son shine.

What be all the things of this world but a shadow (says Job) under the
which the servants of this world lie sleepinge, forgetting their own good,
and neclecting their salvation, and put their trust in the favors and vain
honors of this world.

If thou do put thy confidence in princes, and great men, thou sleep under
^ shadow that soon passes away. Thou may fall into disgrace of thy
prince, as many have done which were at the first in great favor with them,
which after fell out of their favor again: and if that happen not, yet may he
dye, and then he in whom rested all thy hope is gone, and therewith also is thy
hope gone, and thou clean forsaken and left alone.

Cursed is he that puts his trust in man: says the scripture. Ier. 1^.
And cursed is he that puts his confidence in princes: whose prosperities
do pass away, whose favors are soon finished, whose good wills be mutable,
and are wont often to hate those whom they have most loved. See what a folly
it is to sleep so necgligently under a shadow. Sleep not under the shield of
thy friends and of thy riches, for this vanity soon passes away again

Trust not in thy beauty, for by every light occasion it vanishes soon away.
In any thing of this present world put thou no trust at all, for the glory
and pleasures thereof, pass away like a wind. And straighte way shall thou be
assaulted by death. And such has been the end of all the honors that have
passed here before us, they were but vanities, And so have they passed away
again.

Saul slept carelessly, 1. Re. 26.
and put him self into very great danger having his enemy ready at hand to
kill him, In so much that Abisai wo^d have thrust him through with his spear
if David had not stayed him: And all this was, because he put his trust in his
great force of men and weapon that he had about him. Many putting trust in
their courage and their youth, have stayed from doing of penance, and slept
without taking any care for their souls: But they sleep under the shadow of
this miserable life, being always at the point of loosing it.

Thou art more to be blamed the^ ever was Isboseth, 2. Re. 4.
that having thine enemies still about thee, and being compassed about with
so many dangers, thou do sleep in a careless dream, trusting always in
thy vain desires. But death shall comme upon thee, and awake thee, and then
shall thou know that thou were all that while but under a shadow, and that at
last thou shall find thy self to be set down at the hott fire of hell,
where worldly men shall be burned and tormented for ever.

Oh how much shall thou find thy self then, at that paynefull time of thy
passage to have been mocked and deceived, when thou shall see before thy face,
all those vain pleasures and worldly delights in which thou did put so
much affiance while thou liuedst here, clean vanished away and turned into a
smoke? Sleep not under the shadow of these worldly vanities, least when death
comes to awake thee thou be found compassed about with miserable troubles,
and paynefull torments.

HE THAT SERVES THE world, not only has no revvard of it, but also is kept
by it in contynuall broils and troubles, and at last brought to a miserable
end. CHAP. 10.
YE shall serve strange gods, which shall give ye no rest, H^er. 16.
neither day nor night: says God unto worldly folk. They which do love
the world, do serve their own passions, and do continually suffer
intolerable torment by them.

The feigned flattery of Dalida drew Samson to his death, Iu. 16:
whom the Philistines did first make blind, and after set him to grynde in a
mill wheel: Even so thou that art a seruante of this world, and seek by
all means to please thine inordinate appetites, and to get the riches and
honors thereof, thou shalt find at the last that thou haste but gone round
about in the wheel as Samson did.

The prophet says, that the wicked go always compassing about, Psalm. 11.
for sinners do never go the direct way, by which the just do walk: As the
wise man says: VVorldly men going still about their worldly business with
much travail, Sap. 10. Prou. ^9.
are much like unto a door going about upon hinges, which do never move out
of their place, but do stay them selves upon sin, as upon their sure
platform and foundation.: they go to and fro, and labor up and down, but
from their sin they will not depart, they be so cawght up with their own
passions: they go about still following their own vanities, and seeking after
their pleasures, like men that had but little brain in their heads, still
trauayling without any profitte or commodity.

Sap. 5.
We travail through many hard and sharp passages, and we are even tired in
the way of wickedness, says Solomon speaking in the person of worldly folk.
If thou do serve the world, thou may labor and toil thy self to death:
but of all thy pains and thy trauayles, thou shall be sure to get no more in
the end then Samson did, for all his pains taken for the Philstines: no more
do thou look for any reward for all thy pains taken in the service of the
world.

Gen* 31.
Jacob served Laban many years with great trayuayle and pain, and yet ten
times did he deceive him, by changing of the reward which he had promised
him. And many do serve the world with like travail that Jacob served Laban,
moved with desire to increase their wealth and their honor, but the world
plays Laban with them, It changes their reward, denying that which it
agreed with them for. The burden of their trauaylles be heavy, and their
pains be vearie unprofitable.

The deceites of Laban, be not comparable with those which the world does
proffer to his servants. The world can not complain, that we do not our
true service to it, but we may well compain that we have not our just
reward for our pains of it again. And allthowghe that worldly men, do
suffer much in this miserable servitude, yet how many be there, that will
suffer any pain most willingly, how sharp so ever it were for the world,
which will not suffer a little trouble for Jesus Christ's sake to gain thereby
eternal glory for ever: we will in no wise change these present things,
for things to come.

The Jews were many of them at that pass, Number. 1.
that they had rather have lived under the tyranny of Pharao still in Egypt,
then by a little travail of their passage thence, gain unto them selves, the
fruitful land of promise.

Those which were invited to the marriage feast in the Gospel, thought it
better for them to travail about their business with pain, then to be
partakers in peace of the solemn feast of the eternal king: If the king of
heaven had invited them to travail, and the world unto pleasure and ease, they
might well have been excused. But when it is all contrary, then is the error
to manifest, if thou should despise the sweet service of Christ, for the
displeasant servitude of the devil.

Think it not better for thee, to bear the heavy yoke of the world, then to
suffer a little for gods sake, and thereby to live after in happiness for ever.
He is a fool that passes many a day in pain, and many a night without rest,
through the continual pain of his teeth rather then he will abide a short
pain in the taking out of the rotten tooth that greeueth him, and so to be
after at quiet rest and free from all his former pain.

There be many that will rather lead a paynefull life in consentyng to their
own appetites, then by withstanding their passions for a short time enjoy
the pleasant sweetenes of the spirit for a long space after. You shall see
sometime a free man that is in perfect liberty which will for a little fond
love which he has cast upon some bondwoman, be content for the satisfieng of
his fa^tasie to marry the woman, and thereby cast him self into wilful
bondage for ever: So does the will of man, (loosing the love of God,) for his
own fond affection cast upon a creature, think it nothing to put it self
into the bondage and servitude of the world.

Iud. 16.
Allthough that Samson knew well by the often guylefull deceytes which Dalida
had used, she could not have any other meaning in her earnest desire to know
the secret wherein his strength did co^siste, then thereby to sell him to the
Philistines, yet was his affection such unto her, and so much did he love her,
that rather then he would displease her, he would be taken and made a servile
prisoner for ever. And so was his fond love, the cause of his foul fall, by
means whereof he was led shortly after to his death, and so was his light
crediting of false lyeng words, made his confusion.

Who does hold thee now in the service and bondage of this world, but thy
light creditynge of his false lies and flattering words, whereby at the first
thou were brought unto this estate, which if thou have not good regard unto
(...) thou may happily be used at the last, as Sampson was by that false
lyeng Dalida.

Does it not appear in the story, how the first thing that they did unto
Sampson after his taking, was the plucking out of his eyes? And thou which the
world takes into his service, what art thou but made blind thereby: As it
makes all those blind which do give credit to his deceyfull words which he
abuses them with, to the end that they may not perceive the paynefull state in
which they live, nor know how sweet the yoke of Christ is.

Oh how much is it better for thee to reign with God by serving of him, then
to live in the world, and suffer extreme bondage. Thou may well see here
now, how the world does use all those which do serve it: shake of therefore
from thy neck the most heavy yoke thereof, and put on, the most sweet and
easy yoke of Jesus Christ.

THE CONSIDERATION OF much bitterness that we find in the world, (wherein
so little svveetenes is to be fovvnde, and that but only in appearance) does
give us easelie to understand, how heavy the yoke of his bondage is, and how
much it is to be eschevved, CHAP. 11.
Mat. 11.
COME unto me all ye that do travail and be laden, and I will refresh you,
says our lord. The lovers of this world says God almighty do go about
like men that are laden, and carry heavy burthe^s about them.

The world does get all that which it ^rauayleth for, with trouble and business
and with fear does enjoy it, and with grief forgo it again. Apo. 24.
It is written in the Apocalips, That they which had adored the beast never had
rest, which they in deed can never obtain which do adore their beastly
appetites.

Little children do run up and down all day blowing of a fether in the
air, and sometime they hurt the^ selves by falling, but they are to be
pardoned because they be without judgment. But thou that art a man of reason,
and of perfect age, art worthy of much reprehension, if thou sholdest run
and take pain after the vanity of this world, and the vain blastes of false
honors and riches.

Thou see not where thou set thy feet, Thou know not the danger in
which thou live: Thou considerest not the travail that thou endurest, nor
wherefore thou do endure it, which if thou did weygh well, thou sholdest
find all that thou seek and laborest for here, to be in effect nothing.
What profit do the little children get in runnyng all day after a fether?
they are well weried for their labor, And proffit or commodity have they none,
but sometime perhaps a good knock on their head, by reason of some fawle
that they take. And when death comes, that must make an end of thy paynefull
life, wherein thou haste served the world: thou shall have no other reward for
thy pains, but new sorrows again.

Whosoever will lay siege to a town, will first look well, that the expenses
of the siege exceed not the comoditie, that he shall get by winning of the
town. And if thou would but consider what the service of the world does cost
thee, thou would soon leave of thine enterprise. If in thy worldly
consolations thou fyndest sorrow, thou must not marueyle thereat: for it is a
sower crabbe and therefore no marueyle that it sets thy teeth on edge. Ose.

God says, I will compass thy way about with thorns. The pleasant
orchardes be set about with sharp thorns, because no man should come at the
fruit. These thorns, says our lord, be the cares and lo^ginges after riches.
Luc. 8.
These has God laid in our way to the intent, that when we should see with
what pain those fruits be gotten, we should be affrayed to meddle with them.

Among all our pleasures here, God has planted sorrow and remorse of
conscience, because we should not have any earnest desire or longing after
the^. Among our prosperities has he put much bitterness, because we should not
love them. And sin is always the torment of him that commytteth it. The
greefes and the felicities of this present world do go always accompanied
together. If thou do love the gooddes of this world, thou must needs be
subject unto much travail and care for them, for when thou have them, thou will be affrayed to loose them. But if thou be disturbed in the quiet
possession of the^, then do thou suffer some trouble presently by them,
which God does suffer always to fall unto thee, that thou may set thine
whole love upon him, and remove it clean away from these vanities of the world.

God has appointed this for a medecyne to temper our disordynate appetites
withal: But this world has such a greedy sort of servants following it,
that they will not stick to run through the thorns all imbrewed with their
own blood, for to gather of this fruit. Oh how many are there at this day
like unto those, who for the satisfying of their unruly appetites and for the
wynnyng of some fond pleasure, do suffer great grief and remorse of
conscience, and do bring their lewd desires to effect, allthoughe it be with
never so much loss and hynderance to their soul. And all this labor do they
take for to please their senses without any recompense at all again for their
pains.

If thou did but consider, with what prejudice to thy conscience, thou
did buy all this short delight, thou would not be so much a fool as to
thrust thy self into so many dangers of the world. The service of the world
is a dear service, It is an hard yoke, and an importable burden. Christ
calls all those unto him that are weried with carrying so heavy a burden on
their back, as the heavy yoke of the world is. And when he fyndeth that thou
art weryed with seruinge of the world, and that thou do playnlie perceive
all thine own defects: Then does Jesus Christ call thee, as one being then
best disposed to come unto him. He that does not first hate the vanity of
this life, will never lay hand upon the cross of Christ. And until thou
think all this whole life, to be but a vearie vain folly, thou art not meet
to follow Christ.

Therefore Christ our redeemer calls not those that do think this worldly
yoke sweet, but those that do take yt as an heavy burden, and are grown
werie of it. And so much less pain as thou find in bearinge this heavy
yoke of the world so much more art thou in danger to be lost and to perish.

It is good for thee to know, what a heavy burden thou cariest, that thou
may cast it of, and take upon thee the sweet yoke of Jesus Christ.

HE SHOWS HOW there is no pleasa^ter nor sweeter thing, then the yoke of
Jesus Christ, and that it is easy and light of carriage to those that do love
him, because he helpethe to bear part of the burden with the^. CHAP. 12.
MY yoke is sweet, and my burden easy and light: Mat. 11.
says our lord. The yoke of Christ is sweet unto them that do love him: It
is heavy to them that be but luke warm: and vearie bitter it is to them that
are proud of heart. But it is easy to them that are meek, and pleasant to
those that are humble.

Our sweet Jesus works all things sweetly, and every virtue has his good
and commodity, joined unto it, which does comfort him that does exercise it.
And in every adversity it is comfort to have company. And to the afflicted,
Jesus christ is always a present companyon. And he that takes his yoke on
his sholders, can never live without comforts.

The holy law of our Lord is called a yoke, because a yoke is always
carried by two, and if thou do willingly submit thy self to the yoke of
Christ thou go^^^ not alone, for Christ him self goes with thee, and helps
thee to bear a part of thy burden. In all afflictions that thou bear for
Christ, thou shall be sure to have him present with thee to help thee.

3. Re. 22.
The lesser ox bears always the heauiest end of the yoke. Now then Christ
being the least and the most humble of all men, the yoke must needs lie
heauiest upon him, and then must thy part be the lighter, in as much as Christ
takes upon him the heavier part. The yoke that him self bare, was vearie
heavy to him, whereby ours is made much the easier, and through his great
burden grows our great ease. What could thou deuyse to do for Christ,
but that he has done much more for thee? And that much eases the burden of
the seruante, when he considers how much his innocente master Christ did
bear before for him.

As much as the mercy and benignity of Christ exceeds all other men's, so
much is the burden of Christ lighter then any other man's: it is a burden to a
man to be without this yoke, and an ease for to have it.

The yoke of Christ does not only, not lade a man, but makes him the more
light. Although that the bird having her wings upon her, has by so much as
the waighte of her feathers does come unto a burden of them, yet these wings
of hers make her nothing the heuier, but she is made lighter by them, then if
she were without them. The wayghte of the holy yoke of our Lord, makes that a
man is not slothful, but diligent: it makes not ^ man dull, heavy, nor
dumpish, but light, ^oyfull, and quick. They be neither slaves nor bondmen,
which be under that yoke, seeing they that do submytt them selves thereunto,
be they only which do get the true liberty and dominion of spirit.

The paynefull way of penance is made sweet and easy, by going in the
company of Jesus Christ. In the tribulations which thou shall suffer for
Christ, thou shall be sure to find comfortable consolations. The prophet
says. Psa. 127.
Thou shall eat the labors of thy hands. He sayt^ not that thou shall eat
the fruit of thy labors, but the labors them selves: for the seruante of God
shall not only enjoy felicity, which is the fruit of his labors, but he
shall also in his labors mainteyne him self in this life, with the pleasant
taste, and sweet savor that his soul shall receive in those tribulations
which he suffers for Christ's sake.

Gods goodness is great, which sen^eth unto his which live here in this place
of bannyshement amongst so many trowbles and adversities, quietness and
comfort. The tears of those which do pray, are more pleasant and sweet, then
the lawghers of worldly folk, and one drop of the sweetenes of this
spirit, is more delectable, then all the pleasures and consolations of this
world.

The soul is more fed with the comforts of heaven, then with all the pleasures
that the world can give.

The delights be infinite and unspeakable, which the servants of Jesus Christ,
do find in their sharp afflictions. Sweet flowers do often grow amongst
thorns.

VVordlie men have an evil opinion of the yoke of Christ, and do take the way
to heaven to be very noisome. They give witness of that which they know not,
And condemn the way that they never walked in.

A blind man may evil judge of colors. All holy men before us have gy^^^ us
advise, and by their written books have commended unto us, how pleasan^^ and
delectable a work it is for to serve Christ. And better credit is herein to
be given to those which have carried the yoke them selves, then unto those which
never took it in hand. Never any man yet took this yoke upon him, but that
(...) spoke well of it, and he that has been laden with the burden of sin
on hi^ back, will think this burden of Christ to be very easy, be it never
so sharp i^ show.

Haste thou never perceived ere thi^ how light thine heart has been, aft^^
thou have disburthened thy soul by confession of thy sins? If the^ thou
haste found so great comfort in thy first entry of thy way, which is the
casting away of sin, and seperating thy soul from it, thou may easily
judge by the taste thereof, what thou were like to find in the rest of thy
journey, when thou were well entered in the exercise of virtues.

Thou must not think that by the exercise of one virtue, thou art made
virtuous. Thou must multiply and frequent the doing of good works, for when
thou have once gotten the habit of a verteous life, thou shall labor with
great felicity, and much ease. And leaving now that which is naught, and
following still that which is good, thou shall find full con^entation of thy
labors at last. And ^hey that proceed on a pace in the way of ver^ue, and go
on forward well, shall find how full of spiritual comfort the yoke of
Christ is.

They which do serve the world, ^oe depryue the^ selves of many benefits.
They know not them selves what they do ^oose, and therefore they do not
esteem it: and because they never tasted of God, therefore do they find
savor in tasting ^f the vanity of this life. If thou will but ^ little
begin to taste of the consolations ^f God, It will be sufficient for thee, to
make he to know many things to be full ^^tter, which do now seem very
pleasant to thy taste.

Since the yoke of Jesus Christ, is so sweet and easy, and the yoke of the
world so heavy and burthenous, take upon thy sholders willingly the yoke of
our lord, and thou shall live ever after contented in this life, and in the
other life shall thou be comforted for ever.

IN ALL OUR TRAVAYLES and troubles, we must have our recourse unto God, with
full hope and trust to be helped by him, and not have any confidence in
worldly help, which is such as we can have no comfort by. CHAP. 13.
Mat. 11.
COME unto me all ye that travail and be laden, and I will refresh you, says
our Lord. Because thou forsakest God, and take counsel of the world, thou
find no remedy in thy greatest distresses: whilst thou folowe^ thine own
passions, thou can never have comfort here: whilst thou obeyest the world,
the true comfort does clean ^lie from thee.

Psalm. 76.
King David was without comfort when he said, my soul refuses to be
comforted. So much was he discomforted, that he refused all things that might
do him any comfort. But when he returned unto God, he was straight ways
filled again with comfort, as he said him self in the same psalm. I
remembered me of God, and I was comforted.

That glorious Marie Magdalene, Luc. 7.
when she saw her self over whelmed with sin, she ran unto Jesus Christ
in the house of the Pharisey and she found pardon. Judas, Mat. 27.
when he saw him self fallen into the danger of perdition, fled unto the
help of man, and he was cast away for ever. Here you may see, how much wyser
that sinful woman was, then was that false disciple of Christ. They were both
sinners, and both of them knew well their faults: but a far better advise
did she take, that went to seek comfort at the well of life, then that fond
disciple did, which went unto death for to seek life.

If there were an Image which once was very perfect, and is now somewhat out
of order, who can better mende it again, then he which first made the same?
Now if thou haste defiled thy soul by some sin, who may better repair the
same, and amend it again, then may that excellent paynter which first made
man after his own image? never commit it to the hands of so evil a workman
as the world is, lest he do utterly deface and mar it. Go not after lies
and the vanity of this false world, Gene. 1.
but convert thee unto thy God that is the fountain of mercy.

It is a very folly for thee to demand alms of a poor man, when there is a
rich man by that would have thee to demand it of him. Every creature is but
poor for to comfort thee: but God is rich in all grace, who gives to all
men his good gifts most abundantly. Turn thee then unto him for the getting
of thy quiet rest. Convert thy self wholly unto him, Psa. 114.
for in him shall thou find quietness and most sweet comfort.

Seek thou unto Jesus Christ with all thine heart, as the dooue sought unto
the Ark of Noah. Do not hang upon this world, as a crow does hang upon
carraine. The dooue never found rest, until she returned unto the Arc again.
Gene. 8.
No more do thou think to find any rest but in Christ Jesus: thou shalt
not find rest nor comfort in the things of the world.

Fly from external comfort, if thou look to be comforted within. If thou be
hungry, turn unto Christ, and he will satisfy thee with bread from heaven*
Happy is he that seeks not for comfort in creatures, Psa. 104.
but puts all his trust in God. Happy is he that flies all exterior and
temporal rest, and embraces the tra^ailes of Christ. Happy is he that goes
^^r of from all these temporal things, and ^ffereth up all his works unto
God.

Refrain thy desire from having of many things, and join thy self unto one
^one, and draw near unto him, for in that ^ne consists all. Let others seek
after exterior things, seek thou only after ^he interior good, and that
shall suffice thee.

Is it not better for thee to draw near unto one thing, then unto many? while
^hou art seeking for these visible things, and think to find rest in them,
the vea^ie true good and invisible things be ^tterlie lost. Thou go after
these mor^all things, seeking contenteme^t in them, and thou do lose better
things whereby ^hou art made miserable, and full of so^owes and bitter cares.

Where so ever thou turnest thee, thou ^halt find much grief and
discontentme^t, except thou do turn thee unto God, which is thy true place
and sure rest. There ^oe thou seek to rest thee, where the ful^es of all
perfection is. Seek for the ly^elie water in the fountain that can never ^e
dried up, to refreshe and to comfort ^hy soul withal, for one drop of
divine comfort is more worth, then the large rivers and habounda^t flooddes of
human comfortes. And he must needs want the true comfort which follows the
false ^oue of this world.

VVorldly men would be quiet in unquiet things, and in things most vnsta^^^
will they look for stabilitie. If thou w^^^ have true rest and felicity, thou
must p^^^ away all the trust which thou haste (...) things mortal and
transitory. Let fo^^ take riches for their shield, and other take honors for
theirs, but do thou dr^^ unto God, and put all thy trust in him.

THE THINGS OF THI^ world do pass away in that have (...) quicknes that
the vearie considerat^^^ thereof might make a man to desp^^^ them, And seek to
get things of (...) stabilitie and contynuance. CHAP. 14.
1* Cor. 7.
THE figure of this worl^ does soon pass away* sa^^eth the Apostle. The glo^^
thereof is unconstant, a^^ all the good that it has (...) it, is but
transitory and ^^^^perie. Job. 20.
Job says: This know I, that (...) the beginning that man was placed (...)
the earth, that the praise of wicked (...) is but short, and the joy of an
Ipocri^^ but like unto a point. If his pride (...) ascend up into heaven, and
his head (...) towch the clouds, yet shall he vannishe away like a bubble in
the water, and they that shall see him, shall ask: where is he? ^^ke a dream
which passes away, even so shall he be, and like a vision in the night.

All that which appears both goodly and fair to the eye runs swiftly
away toward his end and stays not. Job. 20.
Job cold not compare the swiftenes with which these worldly vanities do pass
away unto any thing more aptly, then to a bubble of the water. All the
consolations that do come of the world, be soon dried up and gone. The
consideration only of the little contynuance of these worldly things with
us, and their quick passing away from us, ought to be sufficient to make us to
set naught by them, beside all the other causes which might* and in reason
ought, to make us despise them.

In the winter it appears that the trees be dead, because their leaves and
fruit be gone, but yet the life remains in the root, where all the virtue
and strength of them is preserved and maynteyned, but then are all the fields
and meadows fresh and green, and when summer comes the heat of the son
dries up and withers away the greenes of the fields, and then be the trees
in their chief beauty* all fresh and florisshing with their green leaves, and
their fruit upon them.

This miserable life of ours, is nothing else but a sharp and a hard winter, in
which worldly men be fresh and galante like the green fields, enjoying all
the glory and pleasure of this world? But let them n^^ put any trust therein,
for when the pleasant summer comes of the next life, which shall last and
continue for ever, they shall be dried up, and quyte consumed away. Death will
mow down all their grass, and make therewith matter to increase the flame of
the fiery furnace of hell. I saw (says David) the wicked man exalted, Psalm.
36.
above the high trees of libanus, and a little after I looked again, and
behold there was not any such.

The just men were accounted and holde^ for dead, like unto the trees in
winter, whose true virtue remains hidden in the root, which made them to be
counted of the world for unprofitable and nothing worth. But the summer comes
and their virtue florisheth, and then shall they appear in their glorious
array. Can. 2.
The just shall say the winter (of our tribulation) is past, and now do the
flowers shoot up in our land, Mat. 13.
which shall shine like the son and so be presented before the face of our
God.

I^c. 4.
Put not thy trust in the green and glorious show of this worldly vanity, for
all this freshnes is sone gone, and in an instant is quyte consumed. Love not
the world which thou see slide so fast away, for the love and friendship of
this world is enemy unto God.

Solomon says, that the world shall pass away like a sudden tempest, Prou.
10.
as a thunder clap which makes a great noyce in the air, and like a sudden
shower of rain, which soon passes away and by and by comes fair weather
again: so is all the pomp and glory of this world which no sooner comes,
but it is gone again.

Love thou the life eternal, which shall for ever endure: be careful to get
that life which lasts ever, where thou may always live without fear of
fallinge into death. And if thou can love this life wherein thou fyndest so
much trouble and business, how much more ought thou to esteem that life in
which there is all rest and quyetnes. Remember that thou ^rt but a pilgrim in
this world, be dilligent therefore to get the a sure restinge place in heaven.

All things in this world pass like a shadow away, And as worthy of praise
be they that will not flourish with the world that florissheth, as they be
worthy of reprehension, which do delight to perish, with them that do perish.

That pain which thou take here to deferr death, and to prolong this
transitory life of thine, thou might do well to bestow upon the getting
of the life eternal which can never perish.

THE DESIRE THAT MAN has to content his own will, and to abound in the
things of this world, does cause him to have much care and trouble of mind,
which never will let him be quiet, but does put him still into new
thovvghtes, and more anguyshe of mind. CHAP. 15.
You shall serve strange gods which will never let you have rest neither by
day nor night, Hier. 16.
says God Almighty. The world will not give thee any rest at all. If thou
do follow thine own appetite, thou shall never want trowble and disquietnes.
In the things of this life, thou must never look for quyetnes. And greater
disquietnes can no man have, then in serving his own passions.

Thou which do serve the world, art in as much unquietness, as the wheels of
a clock, by means of thy contynuall carefulnes and taking of thought, which
do grow in thee by occasion of the counterpeases of worldly love, which do
hang upon thy will. This is that which turns the wheels about. This is
that which makes thee lead so evil a life. This is that which never
suffers thee to have rest but does keep thee in a contynuall motion.

There was great strife and contention betwixt the shepherdes of Lot and the
shepherdes of Abraham, Gene. 13.
and the cause thereof grew by no other thing, but by their wealth, and their
abundance of riches. They were both vearie welthie in worldly substance, but
what else did it, but minister unto them matter of trouble and disquietnes? And
it was the cause that these twoe great friends and near kynnesmen were driven
to divide, and separate them selves one from another. This is the good that
grows by much riches.

One of the great plagues that God visited Egypt with all was the little busy
flies, Exodus 8.
whose properties are always to be buzing about men to molest and to vex them
And if they be driven away from one place of a ma^s body, they will get unto
an other. And like unto these be the cares of worldly men, which will never
suffer them to rest nor be in quyetnes. And these cares be sent by God to vex
the rich and ambitious man, as the flies were sent to vex the Egiptians.

Esaias says of wordlie men. They have weyued the spiders web. Esa. 59.
The spiders do consume them selves with much travail and pain in making of
their fine webbes to catch flies, And so do worldly men consume them selves,
with much ^^omaginge of their consciences for the getting of riches and
honors, which do after work their own overthrow and undoing. What
proffit and commodity do they get by all their trauaylles sustained for the
winning of worldly honor and riches? They get nothing at the last, but care
and trouble. And is not this a great infelicitie for a man to travail long
and take great pains, and to have therefore nothing but care and unquietness
in the end? And in the same chapter the prophet Esai says further: They have
put their trust in nothing.

Thou art much deceived if thou think that thou can have any true rest in
the goods of this world: Job. 8.
their trust is like unto a spiders cobweb, says Job. All is with them but
travail and care, and affliction of spirit: and if it were but for the
unquietness that these worldly folk are subject to, thou ought to fly the
vanities of this world.

For two causes did the children of Israel desire to depart out of Egipte,
the one was for the great torment which they sustained by the tyranny of
Pharao: Psalm. 14 1
the other was for the goodness and happiness of the land of promise. The trouble
which thou suffrest in the world does enforce thee to forsake the world: Number.
11.
let the goodness and happiness of the land of the living which is promised
thee, inuit thee as well to leave all these false gooddes of the world.

Be not as a number of those Israelites were, Number. 21.
which would rather suffer the intolerable servitude of Pharao, then enjoy
the pleasant land of promise. Thou must not let thy judgment be so much
corrupted, as to choose rather a miserable life in the perturbations and
remorses of conscience, then to enjoy a most quiet and peaceable life in
Christ Jesus.

Walk on toward that celestial Jerusalem your free mother: Gal. 4.
their shall thou find perpetual rest says the Apostle. Abhor with all
thine heart such unquiet trouble and affliction of thy soul. The vearie misery
of thy life it self bids thee to forsake it. The world it self cries out
upon thee not to esteem it.

Be not like unto the children of Gad, which willingly refused the land of
promise for the liking that they took unto the hill of Galaad, Number. 34*
where they me^t to make their perpetual habitation. In like manner are their
diverse that care not for the glory eternal, contenting them selves with the
gooddes of this miserable world.

Thou must not think to find rest there, Gene. 11.
where all is in a confusion and alteration. The worldly men be amazed and
confounded, they know not them selves what they do, nor whether they do
inte^d to go, no more then did the builders of the tower of Babylon.

BECAUSE THAT ALL THE consolations of this false world be accompanied with so
many infinite sorrows and troubles, and are full of bitterness and grief we
ought only to love God, and his eternal beatitudes. CHAP. 16.
GOD grants not that my spirit should have rest, Job. 9.
and has filled me full of bitterness, says Job. Thou can not in the world
enjoy any perfect rest, nor receive any true joy, where all is bitterness and
sorrow. Consider what sharpenes is found hidden under that which appears
sweet.

First consider the pleasure of sin, And after weygh withal, the pain that
succedeth it. Vices do always apparel them selves after the best and finest
facion being of them selves miserable filthy bondslaues. Let not the pleasure
of these worldly shows deceive thee for all that is within it, is nothing but
affliction and bitterness.

By this thou may perceive what an evil thing vice is, that going so well
and galantlie apparelled is in deed all horrible and loathsome. And
contrariewyse thou shall konwe the goodness of virtue, who always goes
poorly and barelie clothed, and yet is in deed, all fair and gracious. In
all wordlie things thou shall find great trouble and grief.

Christ our savior being in the glory of his transfiguration, Mat. 17.
made mention of his holy passion, to teach us, that the felicity and
prosperity of this world is full of bitterness and vexation.

If the world (being so full of bitterness as it is) be yet so much beloved and
esteemed, how would men have loved and esteemed it, if it had been all sweet
and pleasante? God has mingled sorrows among our consolations here in this
world, because we should hate this life, and love the life to come.

A man that was such a lover of worldly honor, Est. 5.
was very joyful to see how he was invited to the feast of queen Hester, but
his great joy was turned into bitter mourning, when he saw that Mardocheus
would give him no reverence. Sorrow does always go accompanied with worldly
joy, and to them that live in continual prosperity* every small grief does
much annoyance.

It is marvelous to behold, that al things in this life should be so full of
bitterness, and yet that they should be esteemed of so many men for sweet and
sauorie. Great is thy danger, if thou can not only be contented to live
amongst so great sorrows, but also to take pleasure and delght in them. That
sick man is in great danger whose stomach refuses good and wholesome meat,
and can eat nothing but that which is hurtefull and evil for him: and as
little hope is there to be had of that man which leaves the sweet
conversation of Christ Jesus, and casts his affection to like of the poisoned
meats which this world does offer him.

When God fed the Israelites wi^^ bread from heaven, Exo. 10.
yet murmured they against Moses, and wisshed to have again their old gross
diet of Egipte. Their sowles lothed every kind of meat (says the prophet
David.) The only consideration of the bitterness that is in all these worldly
pleasures is sufficient to move us to the detesting of all earthly comfortes.
Psa. 106.


David being in his great triumph, and deuydinge of his pray amongst hi^
soldiers after his victory, 2. Reg. 1.
received the woeful message of the death of Saul, and the ouerthow of all the
Israelites army, which turned his joyful victory, into a sorrowful heaviness,
and made both him self, and all that were present with him to chaung^ their
mirth into mourning, and the joyful feast of their triumphant victory, di^
they convert into a long lamentinge, both for the death of Saul and Ionathas,
and the great slaughter of the people of Israel Here may you see how all upon
a sudden sorrow ouertaketh joy.

Do not thou therefore love the glory of this present world, except thou
do delight to live in sorrow and disquietnes. For when thou art once entered
into the delighte of those false alluring pleasures, and art parting the pray
of thy pleasures amongst thy senses, (As David divided his booty amongst his
soldiers,) thou shall straight ways be ouertake^ with the messenger of death,
which is a troubled conscience, and fearful scruples which be always joined
unto sin. This is that discomfortable messe^ger, which will never suffer thee
to enjoy long, any pleasure of this world. This is he which disquyeteth all
thy joys, and turns all thy worldly comforts into bitter sorrows.

O open thine eyes, and consider what thou have lost by thy loving of the
world. Lament upon thine own soul (o miserable man,) and behold how the
noble men of Israel be slain, when the light of grace is gone from the, and
that thy noble virtues be wounded within thee. The people is also destroyed
when the merits of thy good works be lost. Shut thou the gate of thy soul
never so close, thou can not keep out this messenger from entering in.

Now since this evil news may so easily come unto thee, when thou think
least thereof, the sure way is for thee to love God, and his eternal and true
felicities, and so may thou live contentedlie for this present time, and
enjoy the endless comfort of heaven, when this life is past.

THE WORLD DOES SO blind his servants with the smoke of honors, and with
the svveetenes of his delights, that they setting their whole minds
thereupon, can not perceive the deceyts thereof, nor the foul filthiness of
sin, which they are drowned in. CHAP. 17.
Psalm. 37.
MY virtue has forsaken me, and the light of mine eyes is not with me, (says
the Prophet David. Thou art surely blind, if thou perceyuest not the
unhappy state that thou lyuest in by serving of the world. Think thou that
the faulkener can keep his hawk quiet upon the perch, except he put her hood
upon her head to cover her eyes? The world could never keep thee in the
subjection of his miserable bondage except it first deprived thee of thy sight.

Thou would not be so tied unto these earthly things, which thou love so
much, if thou did but know their vanity and their foul corruption. But
because thou art blind and know not the filthiness of sin in which thou
live, therefore art thou made a slave, and a bond man unto sin, and to
thine own sensual appetites. Open thine eyes, and look into the unhappy
state into which thou art fallen.

The dong of the swallow which (...) upon Tobies eyes being a sleep, (...). 2.
ma^^ him to loose his sight. And the Aopstle says, that the goods of this
earth be but dong* which we find also by experience to have that quality of
making men blind, as had the dong of Tobies swallow. The property of the
swallow is to sing at the beginning of the summer, but suddenly afterward she
stays her singing again. That condition has the world also, first with a
little delicate harmony to lull his lovers asleep, and after to make them
blind with the vain delighte of this earthly mucke and worldly honors.

These worldly men have not eyes to see the light of God, nor the good which
they do loose by having their eyes closed up, with the pleasures of those
vanities which they so earnestly do love. They be like unto Ely the priest, 1.
Re. 3.
which had his eye sight so weak, that he cold not see the lamp of God
which hang continually light in the temple. Although they seem wise and of
good understanding, yet are they not such in deed, sauinge only in worldly
matters: they be like moles which live under the earth, which when they come
abroad into the light, to deal in matters touching the soul, they show them
selves to be both blind and ignorant.

Open the eyes of thy soul, that thou may epsy the vanities of these
corruptible goods, and behold that divine light with which our Lord does
lighten his servants.

Go not thou like a blind man falling from one sin unto a another,
according to that which the prophet Sophonias spoke, of worldly men. They
went about like blind men, Soph. 1. John. 11.
for they sinned against God. Walk in the day says our lord, that thou be
not overtaken with darkness If sinners do walk by night and in the darkness
of their own ignorance, it is no marueyle though they do fall and hurt
them selves.

The eyes which are accustomed to behold these worldly vanities, when they be
once withdrawn from the love and pleasure of the world, they be waxen blind
to behold the true light, and are fallen into that blindenes which God
struck the Egiptians withal, which was such, (as the scripture says,) That
one man saw not an other in three days together, nor was once able to move out
of his place where the darkness took him.

If thou had eyes to behold the misery in which thou live, thou would
not stand still as they of Egipte did, without moving thy foot, or forsaking
thy vices. But thy blindness does hold thee fast. The love of the glistering
shows of worldly vanities does take away thy sight, as the sight of a bear
is taken away with the beholding of the glistering beams of an hot burning
basen, shynyng upon him.

If worldly men had not been blind, Saint John would never have said, that
the world knew not Jesus Christ. John. 1. Thren 4.
It was no great marueyle, that they were blind and knew him not, having upon
their eyes so much earth as they had. They went out of their way like blind
men, says the prophet Iheremy, and so blind that they would not take* any for
their guide; but such other as were blind also. (Which is the very trade of
sinners.) Blind folks do yet know that they be blind, but worldly me^ be
blind, and yet they lawghe and jest at all those which are not blind,
according to the saying of the wise man: The wicked men fly from al those that
ru^ne by the right way.

Our lord said unto certain sinners, Prou. 19. John. 9.
why say you that you do see being blind? your sin is therefore the
greater. And because that they do not see them selves, they think that other
men do not see them, and therefore they do presume to offend God, like unto
the seventy old men of Israel, which God showed unto the prophet Ezechiell.

Beware of this blindness except you be willing to fall into the worst and most
dangerous errors of all.

THE DEPARTINGE FROM this present life is a most terrible and sharp thing to
the lovers of this world, asvvell for their riches and honors which they
leave behind them, as for the pains which they know that they shall
sustain when they be gone hence. CHAP. 18.
THE travail of fools will greeuouslye afflicte them: Eccl. 10.
says the wise man. When death comes, the departing of this life will be
very paynefull unto worldly me^, for that ca^ not be departed from without
sorrow, which was loved without measure.

Death unto a poor man will be less trouble (that has not any thing to leave
behind him) then to the welthie man, which has great riches to forgo, and
then to the lover of these corruptible worldly goods. The troubles of them
which despise the world, shall take end by death, and then shall the
torments of worldly men begin a new again.

A terrible time shall that be, when the body of the worldly man, which has
been brought up in delicacie and tenderness, shall be separated from the soul, to
be consumed shortly after with worms. It will be a grievous departing, that the
rich man shall make from his riches, which he has always disordinatelie
loved, and a ^earie hard thing it will be unto the lover of worldly honor, to
see him self so sodeynlie spoiled of them.

The horses of great men, go covered ^ll day with costly furniture, and with
many men attending upon them: but when they come into the stable at night,
they have all their fresh furniture taken of their backs, and then remains
nothing upon them, but the blows which their masters have bestowed on them,
with the sweat and wearines of their travail. The rich and the mighty man
likewise, that makes his journey through this world, is of all men commended,
honored, and served, ^ut when the hour of death does come, al ^is honors and
riches be taken away, and nothing remains behynd but the blows which he
received by his sins and vices, which maistered him, and kept him under.
^rinces and kings shall not carry their gold and silver with them, when they
de^arte this world, but only their necgligences and errors committed in their
government and charge.

Consider how grievous it will be for thee to depart from those vanities which
thou have so much esteemed, And learn t^ leave the world before it leave thee.
Tak^ thou some good sure handefast betyme, that thou fall not into all those
miserie^ which then do accompany death. Allthough that the world does much
torment thee now, and that thou go heauelie l^^^den with his intolerable
yoke, Yet maye^^ thou shake it of here betyme, that it do^ not more cruelly
torment thee her easier. When the Israelites would have departed out of Egypt,
Exodus 10.
Pharao the Prince of darkness increased their tributes and payeme^te^ and used
them more cruel^ie then before*

To serve the world is a paynefull thing, and his conversation is full of
(...) and trouble, but most displeasant of all (...) it, when thou art about
to depart from it, and leave it altogether. It is an evil thing to carry the
burden of worldly (...) nor upon thy back, and to leave it by death is worse.
the sure and the best way therefore is for thee to despise it in (...) life.
Thou can not here in these world^^ kingdoms transporte any ware from o^^
kingdom to a another without forfeyt^^^ if the ware be forbidden to be carried
by the laws and customs of the country^* And because that riches, honors and
va^^^ties, be wares prohibited, thou must (...) presume to carry them with
thee, into thy heavenly region, least thou fall into danger of the penalty
provided and appointed by the great king of heaven. It is best therefore for
thee to resign the^ up, and to forsake them.

The great and mighty men of the world ought much to fear that rigorous
examination, which they shall be brought unto, when they shall be spoiled of all
that they loved so dearly here. Job says: Job. 24*
They are exalted a little while, but they shall reign no longer, and they
shall be brought low again, and taken away with all that they had, and they
shall be cut down like the cares of corn.

They be exalted unto honors and dignities, but how endures that glory,
which is so soon gone away again? when death shall come who with his cruel
hook (as Job says) shall cut them down as corn is cut in the field. The
grain that is good shall be saved and brought into the granier of heaven, and
the chafe (which be the wicked men, and is nothing worth,) after it is well
fanned and tried from the corn, shall be cast away into the furnace of hell. No
man can tell what the sorrow of worldly men shall be, when they shall forsake
the world.

If such then, shall be their pain and trouble, leave thou the vanities of this
world with a good will, and do away from the all worldly affection, and so
shall thou cut from ^hee many troubles and vexations.

THE WORLD USES TO give in recompense of long payneful service, short and
false joys, and at las^ revvardeth them with the fire of hell, and therefore
it ought to be fled from, and God almighty to be followed, who for small
service, and little travail, will give good and euerlasting^ rewards. CHAP.
19.
THEY rendered me, eui^ for good, Psalm. 34.
and made my so^^ barrayne, (says David.) (...) is a most miserable and
d^lorous life, to serve the world which is so ungrateful and forgetful. And
it is a wretch^^ estate that a man is in, when he forsake^^ the truth, and
follows after falsehood* And does choose short transitory things and leaves
those things which be d^^^ble and permanent. The world does use (...) give for
things only appearinge goo^ the everlasting pains of hell, And Go^ for small
pains, does give glory eue^^lasting.

For a short and a false joy the ^o^^ rewards his servants with
intollerabl^ torments: and God for small pains taken for his sake here in this
life, makes his servants partakers of joy which never shall have end.

For a little wealth and honor which the world does lend unto his servants
here for a short time, it rewards them with poverty and shame perpetual
for ever: and God for a few days well and paynefully spente in his service
here, does give in full satisfaction to his servants therefore, infinite joy
and treasure, and honor that ever shall endure. Is it not better then, to serve
God and to enjoy afterward eternal bliss, then to serve this corruptible
world, and after be tormented for ever.

It is better (surely) in this life, never to taste of these short delights of
the world, then by carrying of them hence, to burn with them everlastingly in
hell. It is better to live well here in the obedience of God, then to lead an
evil life in seruinge of the world, who will shamefullie afterward, lay in thy
dishe, the small apparent pleasures which it bestowed on thee here, that it may
with the better color cast thee after into hell fire.

God commands things that be most easy, and the world never commands
any thing, but that which is most difficult and hard. God commands us to
forgive injuries, and the world bids us to revenge them. Much pain do we
take in reuenginge us of our enemies, whereas in the folowinge of Christ we
should save all that pain. Why then had thou rather serve the world with
pain and labor, then serve God with eas^ and pleasure?

By serving of God thou have two glories, and by serving the world thou have
two helles. When the world tells thee, that thou must seek out for riches
and honor, does it not inuit thee unto great trouble? If the pain which thou
bestowe^^ for the world, thou would willingly bestow for Christ's sake, thou
sholdest live pleasantly and contentedlie here in this life, and in the other
thou sholdest lyu^ blessedlie for ever.

No one man will serve another without reward, but will first agree with his
master before he enter into his house to serve him. Before thou do enter
into the service of the world, and take his heavy burden on thy sholders,
make first thy bargayne with it, and see what thou shall have for thy pains.
Thou sholdest ask the devil, the world, and the flesh, the reward that they
will give thee in recompense of all thy pains taking in their service, seeing
thou determinest to forsake heaven for them: thou must not leave a great
reward, except thou may be sure of a greater.

Gal. 6.
Of the flesh (says S. Paul,) thou shall reap nothing but corruption. If
thou look to the payment that the devil makes to those that be his, thou
shall find ^t to be nothing but torments. And if thou make reckenyng with the
world, thou ^halt find that his servants be soon for^otten.

Truly all thy harm grows of this, that thou will not make thy bargayne well
^eforehande with these tyra^tes which use ^o promise much, and to perform
little. Meddle not with them, before thou have ^greed with them, see first what
payment ^hou shall have. There did never yet any ^erue the world, but that was
sorry therefor at last. It would be continually served ^ere, and yet after all
the service done, it makes his servants either starve for hunger, or else with
stripes, drives the^ naked ^ut of his doors. If thou do serve it, ^hou
shall be sure of grievous passions here, and no comfort when thou art hence.

And if thou do serve Jesus Christ, ^hou shalt find in all thy labors
inward comfort and sweet consolations: and if happily thou sholdest fail of
those inward comfortes here, yet (since death makes an end of all thy pains)
thou ought to take comfort of that, and of thy comfortes to come after
death.

It is not to be accounted travail which lasts so little a while. Job. 14.
The life of man is but short, and the pains of the saints and holy men be
paste, and all forgotten, but the sorrows of worldly men shall endure for ever.
It were better for thee to obey God (although he shold^ command thee to
burn in the fire) for the time thou live here, then to enjoy the pleasures
of this world, and burn afterward in the fire of hell everlastingly*

Fear not the trauayles that are to take an end with this life, but fear
those, that when death comes begin a new again, and never take end after:
thy friends shall not save thee from those pains, neither thy riches, honor,
or worldly favor: no there shall not any thing at all redeem thee from them:
the world shall have an end, but God endures for ever.

Give not ear unto the false lying deceytes of the world, for it plays the
hangman with thee, which first conducteth thee by a fair green path, (which
be the counterfeit comfortes and pleasures of this life) and straight ways
after dispatcheth thee toward the place of thy punnishment, which is the
everlasting torments of hell: but an evil reward for so good service.

THE WORLD HAS NO sooner advanced those which do serve it unto preferment,
but that it does straight vvayes again forsake them, and so much as it
exalts them higher, so much the sorer fall does it give them, and makes
them in a moment to vannish away with all the riches and honors that they
have gotten. CHAP. 20.
I SAVV the wicked man exalted above the high trees of Libanus, Psalm. 36:
and within a while I passed that way again, and behold he was not to be
found says the prophet. The world does highly advance those which do serve
it, but when they have well tasted of his pleasures it forsakes them, and
forgets them.

The prophet Baruck was well ware hereof, Bar. 3.
when he cried out alowde saying where be the Princes of the people, and those
which have subdued the mightiest beasts of the earth, and have spent their
days in hawkinge after the birds of the air? And those which do hoord up
gold and silver, and those things in which men do commytt trust, and yet
never do attain to the end, nor do satisfy their desires. They were
devoured by the earth and are descended down into hell. The glory of this
world soon passed away from them, and all their comforts ended in a moment.
The pleasures of the ungodly do soon come to naught.

It is a vanity to trust in the honors of this world, seeing they never
remain with them long that do possess them, The wicked man enjoys that
which the world does give him but for a short time and yet many a mock has he
therewithal. The world has played with Princes and great men for a little
while, And after that they had well tasted of his pleasures for a space, he
suffered them to perish, and to be lost for ever.

What were their honors and their high estates unto them, but only ministers
of matter, which caused their more dolorous death, and more infamous fall? To
what end served all that vain ware, but to give them the more pain in the
parting from it again? If thou be exalted on high unto any great glory,
beware that thou sleep not there the while, for the world watches always
occasion to pluck thee down, and to give thee a fall.

The glory of this world soon vanishes away, and all the pleasures thereof be
false and deceytefull: they be flowers which soon do fade away, and little
trust to be had in them, for when worldly men do think them selves most sure
of them, then do they soonest forsake them

The hangman brings the guilty person to the top of the ladder, and ^hen
throws he him most cruely down, and with much shame does make an end of
him: So does the world exalt his servants intangling them in all kind of
vices, to give them after the more shameful fall.

That great Babylon mentioned in the Apocalips vaunted of the great
prosperity, Apo. 18.
which she had here in the world, but the more sure that she thought her
self to stand, the greater fall she after received in the end?

That covetous rich man, of whom S. Luke makes mention, bosted of his great
riches and power, but it was straight ways told him: thou fool this night
shall ^hy soul be taken from thee, Luc. 12.
and then the riches that thou haste gathered together, whose shall they be?

The Children of Israel were scattered abroad to seek straw and stubble.
Exodus 5.
There is no scatteringe abroad to seek things that are precious, but men
must scatter abroad to seek straw, and such like light stuff. All men do
seek after riches, for all things are obedient unto money. And they that be
seekers thereof, do go all scatteringe one from another, because covetousness
knows no friend, neither remembers any kynred. The little value of honors and
riches is noted in this saying, that they sought all abroad for straw, but the
worst of all is this, that after they had sought it, and found it to, yet were
they well beaten for all that. Which does signify unto us, that the vanities
which we do seek with so much trouble and business, does give us much sorrow,
both in the getting, and the keeping. And often times it happens, that the
things which are earnestly sought, do serve also for straw to make a fire
in hell, for the busy seekers thereof.

Those poor afflicted Israelites trauayled about all the land of Egypt to
seek out straw, and at the end of all their trauayll, they were all beaten
for their labor. And so falls it out by those, which when they offend God by
their busy pain taking here in this life shall after for their labor be
punyshed for ever in the next. Malice and noughtines is a punishment of it
self. For allthough that a^ evil conscience be some times at rest, yet is it
never in perfect suertie. And therefore seeing the world so soon forsaket^
them that love it, and leaves them destitute of all such pleasures as it was
wont (...) yield them, be thou no longer in daunge^ unto it, but prevent it
first, and forsake it, before it forsake thee, And so shall thou gain honor
and credit by it.

THE HEARTS OF Worldly men be so vexed with the insatiable desire of the
riches, honors and solace of this world, that either they perceive not, or
will not perceive, the holy inspirations of God, by which he calls on
them to seek their own salvation. CHAP. 21.
I STAND knockinge at the door, (says God, Apo. 3.
) if any will hear my voice, and let me in, I will enter and suppe with him,
and he shall suppe with me likewise. With such like words does God provoke
the sinner knockinge at the door of his soul. Here does small courtesy
appear, if our Lord shall knock at our heart, and not be suffered to enter,
And when he desires but the consent of our heart, it will not be granted unto
him.

If it do seem small good manner unto thee, to let thy friend tarry long at
thy door knockinge before he be let into thy house: how much more worthy of
blame art thou if thou let God almighty stand knocking at the door of thy
soul, and gyuest him no entrance in. He speaks here conditionally, saying,
If any man will let me in, by the work of his free will, whereby it lies in
his hands, either to consent or not to consent. And if he do enter, and come
in unto thee, it is but for thy help and benefit, since he says that he will
suppe and rest with thee. He brings the meat with him, and will not suppe
with thee at thy charge.

He does not by thee, as the poor sowler does by the partridge, who inuiteth
him to supper, because he may feed on him, which is the vearie property of
the devil, Gene. 3.
who invited poor father Ada^ with the fruit of the forbidden tree, to make a
pray of him afterward, according to the sayng of Iheremy the proph^t. Tren. 3.
Mine enemies have hunted after me, and at last have taken me as if I had b^ne
a bird. What are worldly pleasures, abundance of riches, and desire of
honors, but a bayte laid by the devil to bring us into his snares? When he
makes much of thee, then does he hunt after thee, If thou be not wary and
considerate in taking any thing at his hands, thou will soon be taken up in
the nets of his deceytes.

But contrariewise, God inuiteth us, intending nothing, nor seekinge any thing
of us, but to do us good, and to help us. And allthoughe that the voice of
his call be sweet and pleasante, yet is not he harkened unto, nor any
answer of admyttance given unto him, because the love of the world has
closed up the doors of our hearts.

The noise that the world makes in the soul of a sinner, is vearie loud and
shirle, And when there is much noise within the house, he which knocks at
the door, cannot be heard. The spiritual crying, is the earnest desire of the
soul, and the prayer that is made with effect, and force of the mind.

Moses prayed and never moved his lips, Exodus 14.
and God asked him wherefore he cried. 1. Reg. 1.
Anna the mother of Samuel the prophet, prayed in the temple, and never opened
her mouth, and yet sent she most effectual prayers unto God almighty. Psalm.
9.
Our lord hears the desire of the poor, and his ear has harkened to their
prepared petitio^s, (says the prophet David.)

The love which is borne to the things of this world, does make a great stir
and noise within the inward parts of the heart. The desires of honor do never
cease cryinge out. The appetite of revenge, and the greedy desire of money,
do make a contynuall clamor within the heart of man. It is no marueyll then
that God is not heard in that house where so many cryings out be of all
disordinate appetites. And one great inconvenience is this, that when thou
have once given thy consent, to all thy vain desires, and let them have all
their own will, yet will they never consent to let thee be quiet, but will
still be asking and craving for more, as if they had never had any thing of
their desire before. The covetous worldly men, allthoughe they do get that
which they do desire, yet are they never contented therewith.

The remedy then, that thou have for to hear him which knocks without, is
first to quiet all that troublesome people that do disquyet thee within, Let
not thine appetites have their will, for then shall thou never be quiet, nor
have any rest. Resign up thine own will, and do away thine affections, and
then shall thou soon have silence.

Content thy self with that which thou have, considering the shortenes of this
life, and the great poverty and humility of Jesus Christ, and so shall thou
make all thy disordinate appetites to be in peace and tranquillity.

Drive from thine heart the love of the world, and reduce thy self to a
quietness, and the^ shall thou hear the sweet inspiration and pleasant voice of
Christ Jesus. Put from thine heart the cares of this world, and then may thou
say unto God with holy Job. Job. 14.
Thou will call, me and then will I make answer unto thee.

HE SHOWS HERE BY sundry examples out of the old testament, and many
authorities of the old and new testament both, how the good are always
persecuted, and the wicked are favored and esteemed. CHAP. 22.
IF ye were of the world, Io. 15*
the world would love you, as those which were his, but because you be not of
the world, the world cares not for you: says our Lord. It is no new thing
that the wicked should persecute the good and the servants of the world the
servants of Christ. Gene. 4. Gene. 21. Gene. 27. Gene. 37. 1. Re. 1. 1 Re. 18.
3. Re. 19.
So did Cain persecute Abell, Ismael Isaac, Esau Jacob: The brethren of Joseph
persecuted Joseph: Phenenna Anna, Saul persecuted David, Iesabell Elias.
Because the life of good men, is as it were a secret reprehention of the evil
doing of those that be naught: It is a natural and an ordinary thing in
this life that wicked men and sinners should persecute those that are just and
good. Job says that the holy men in this life, be like children that be borne
before their time, because they be sodaynlie as it were secretly hidden and
buried out of the way, for because they do not meddle nor busy them selves
with the things of this world, But the wicked be the lyuelie children of this
world, and for such they do show them selves by their dealing in the world.

The thieves which do break by night into the house to rob, the first
thing that they do after they be entered the house, is to put out the candle,
to the end that they may rob without being seen. Even so play the wicked in
seeking to darken the fame of those that by their virtue and Justice, do shine
like bright candles in the world: for they which do evil do always hate
the light. Job. 3. 2. Re. 6.


David rejoiced in spirit, and daunsed before the Arc of our Lord, and
strayghte way Nicholl his wife began to scorn at him therefore: for it is
always the custom of the wicked to scorn at the works of those which be
virtuous.

1. Esdr.
The people which inhabited within the country of Jury, after the transmigration
of the Jews thence, upon their return thither again, would not suffer them
to reedify the temple, but gave them all the impedimentes they might, to hinder
their work: which is the very facion of worldly men at this day, to hinder all
those good men, that go about to build up the holy edifice of the heavenly
Jerusalem: But the very natural and true Israelites, with one of their
hands framed up their building, and with the other hand defended them selves
from their enemies. And the like must thou do also: thou must not leave the
good work which thou haste begone and taken in hand, but still following of
thy labor, and going about thy good and virtuous business, thou must defend
thy self by patience from the malice of thine enemies.

It is a great token that thou art not good, when thou can not bear well
the injuries of evil men, and he that through his impatience can not suffer
the wrongs of the unjust, does give testimony against him self that he is
not yet a good man. Thou ought courageously to bear, and willinglye to
suffer the persecutions of worldly men, for it is not only no shame to thee,
to bear them, but rather a great praise and glory unto thee.

It were a shame for thee to be praised of such as are naught, and it is all
one thing, to be flattered of them that are naught, and to be praised for
doing of that which is naught. And as it is all one thing, to be iniuried of
the wicked, and to be praised for doing good deeds: so is it a very madness to
do any thing that may make thee famous amongst infamous persons. For when
wicked men do find fault with our life, then in truth is our life approved,
and that life is approved, which the wicked do reprove. Thou show some
part of justice to be in thee, when thou beginnest to be a trouble unto the
enemies of justice.

It is no reproach unto the light, that the battes can not away with it, but it
is a commendation unto it that they do fly from it. 1 Thessalonians. 5.
Ye be the children of light (says the Apostle) unto good men. The same
Apostle says, 2 Cor. 6 Prou. 1.
what has light to do with darkness? VVisdome is persecuted by the
ignorante, and fools do always despise those that be learned: and therefore
ought not the children of light to be grieved, that they be iniuried by the
children of darkness.

If blind men do not judge rightlye of colors, the fault is not to be
attributed to the colors, which be nevertheless bewtifull and fair. To be
praised of such is a great disprayse, and an honor it is to be dispraysed by
them. It is always a sign of great courage to despise injuries and offenses.
Prou. 16.
Solomon says: That a patiente man is more worth then a strong man, and he
that can conquer him self, of greater value, then he that conquereth great
cities: virtue withers away if it have no adversaries.

It is not for any man to stop the mouths of all men. Although the dogs
do bark at us, that can not let, but that we be men indewed with reason, and
they beasts still. And although the wicked do murmr against thee, and do
persecute thee, that can never make, but that thou art still virtuous, and
they sinners, and enemies of God.

And if worldly men do learn means how to persecute thee, thou must also
learn patience how to withstand them: and this is that wisdom which thou
ought to study for in the school of Jesus Christ.

Ecclesiasticus says: Eccl. 33.
Against good is evil, and against life is death. So is the sinner ever
against the just man. And since that worldly men do always persecute the
servants of Christ, thou must seek to overcome by silence and patience, And
so shall thou get a glorious crown at the last.

HOW INIVRIES OVVHGT patiently to be borne and not to be revenged, but the
reueng to be committed into gods hand, for whose sake thou ought to
forgive all vvronges that be done unto thee. CHAP. 23.
LEAVE unto me reuengement, and I will pay it for you, says our lord. Romans
12,
If thou do revenge thee of the offenses committed against thee, what shall
God have to revenge for thee. The greatest revenge, that thou can take of
thine enemy, is not to be reue^ged on him at all, for thou can not hurt him,
but that thou must first begin with the hurtinge of thy self.

Leave unto God the punnyshement, for he will take reuengement for thee, much
better then thou can do for thy self. If thou do hold thy peace, God
speaks for thee, And if thou speak, God will hold his peace. It will be
much honor for thee, that God does make answer for thee. Luke. 7,
S. Marie Magdalene being condemned and despised by the Pharisey, held her
peace, and our lord made answer for her and became her advocate, and the
setter fourth of her praise and well-doinge. Thou shall get more honor by
holdinge of thy peace, then thou shall do by thine aunsweringe: Do not render
evil, but overcome evil with doing well.

Romans 12.
So much of a wise man have thou in thee, as thou have patience in thee. And so
much of a fool have thou in thee as thou have impatient passions in thee.
Virtue without patience is a widdowe, and patience is the preserver of all
virtue. Patience enjoys well the sharpest storms of tribulation. And the
greatest token by which a just and a good man may be known, is with good
courage and fortitude to bear the assault of adversities and affliction. By
adversity it is made manifest to the world, what love a man does bear to God,
and to a virtuous life, And he that has patience ouercometh him self.

If thou did consider with what love God does send thee tribulations, thou
would willingly receive them, and give him thanks for them. Adversities be
the gracious gifts which God bestows upon his friends and familiars, to
set out, and to bewtefie their souls withal.

An impatient sick man makes the physician cruel. If thou be grieved at the
bitterness of thy medecin, thou do but increase thine own pains the more,
for that which is taken with good will, can never offend, nor displease thee.
The greatest part of discretion is to use patience. The punishment and
afflictions of God, be like unto the surgeons launcers and rasors, which who so
in time of need repelleth and puts away from him, is the causer of his own
woe and misery. God uses afflictions for our remedies, which who so
necglecteth, neclecteth God also, who for our good did send them to us. But God
knowing our weakness and frayltie, does sometime bind us hand and foot, (As
the surgion does an impatient sickeman) that so he may make us to recover
again the health of our souls, impaired by our own impatience. The best way
therefore for thee to be made whole, is to take patiently all adversities.

Christ and his disciples sailed with a contrary wind: Mar. 8.
Contrary to malediction is benediction, and contrary to hate is love. If
thou do offend him that offends thee, thou do not sail with a
contrary wind. Bless him that curses thee love him that hates thee, and
that is the ready way for thee to heaven. The Apostle says: Romans 12*
Bless ye all those that do persecute you: bless but curse not at all. And
in an other place he says: Let us bless, 1. Cor. 4.
when we be cursed, if persecutions do fall to us, let us bear them.

He sayleth with a contrary wind as Christ sailed on the ship of the
cross, that prays for his enemies, and does good to them that do persecute
him. The wicked do also many times suffer persecutions and sickness as well as
the good, for that God will, that they shall in this life begin to feel of
the torments which they must suffer after in hell. But by the adversities them
selves, it is easelie known, which be they that be given for to gain by them
life everlasting: And which be they, which are given to begin everlasting
death by.

If thou shall see any man which in his sickness shall blaspheme or greeuouslie
offend God, thou may perceive, how that tribulation is given him for his
punnyshment, and for to begin to feel his hell here. But if he have
patience, and do give God thanks in his punnyshement, then may thou be
sure, that God has sent that infirmity unto him for his good and benefit, to
cleanse him from his former faults, and to augment his glory in heaven.

Thou must have patience in adversity, if thou look to be of the number of
the elect. Patience in adversity and tribulation, is to God a most acceptable
sacrifice. In patience there be many good things. Do but hold thy peace, and
thou shall overcome, And if thou be sorry to day, thou shall be glad to morrow.
If thou be to day discontented, thou shall to morrow be comforted. For so small
a time then, temper thy sudden motions, and refrain thy tongue. Do not
afflict thy self, neither do thou drown thy self in a small water.

In good works, as fasting, alms, and penitence, thou art so pursued with
humayne praises, that thou do often loose a great part of thy merit, but
patience is a secret treasure. Mat. 13.
For men can not see what thou suffer, neither can they perceive the
injuries done unto thee, because they touch not them. If thou have patience and
do hold thy peace, thou art not praised: because in suffering, silence
bears the sway, and has the domination, but if thou be impatient, then do
many words bear all the rule. If thou be impatient, then do all men find
fault with thee, but if thou have patience, then will no man say ought of
thee, for men do hear well thine impatient words, but of thy patience being
done, and saying nothing* they have no consideration at all.

The more that thine heart is sacrifised unto God, the more is all the work
that thou workest acceptable unto him: and so much as thy works be less noted
and commended of men, so much be they the more perfect, and better accepted of
God.

Suffer then and have patience a while, for time cures all things: if thou be
faithful unto death, thou shalt receive the crown of life.

BECAUSE THE WORLD IS f^ll of confusion, disorder and misery* it ought to be
fled from, of him that is desirous to find the treasor of heaue^lie riches.
CHAP. 24.
FLY from the midst of Babylon: Ier. 10.
(says God.) The world is full of confusion, where no order is but
everlasting horror. Gold is more esteemed then virtue, transitory goods be
preferred before spiritual and true goods: the world is so full of confusion,
that he which has a soul, has not a true life: it exalts them that be
evil, and it subdueth those that be good.

Our Savior brought three of the perfectest disciples which he had unto the
top of an hill, Mat. 17.
for to transfigure himself before them. The world exalts Judas unto honors
and high estats, leaving those that be good under the foot: it is good for
thee not to inhabit where so little order, and so great confusion is.

Esai speaking of the great mischeee that reigned in Babylon, Esa. 13.
said that the Arabians would not pitch their tents in that place. And he
that considers the confusion and disorder of the world, will never set his
affection thereupon.

When a sick man finds not health in one place, he changes his dwelling
and goes to another. This world is full of sickness, and vearie dangerous for
thee to recover thy health in. Thou will never get thy perfect health whilst
thou do abide with it. Change it and thou shalt find health, forsake it
and thou shalt find life, fly from it betyme, if thou will escape death.
Separate thy self from the noise of this world if thou do mean to live in
rest and quyetnes.

The pleasures and the consolations thereof be more bitter then the waters of
Iherico, and they be as mutable as the moon. 4. Reg. 2.
Thou can not find so evil waters again upon the whole earth. Little shall
thou profit in virtue, in so barrayne and hungry a soil.

Gene. 19.
Abraham looked toward Sodom, and he beheld all the land smokinge and flamynge
as it had been a fiery furnace. And he that will consider this world well,
shall find in it nothing but the smoke of pride, and vanity, and the flame of
disordinate desires. He does well that forsakes all worldly things, flieng
from the ways of sinners, and hydeth him self far of from all the business
and dangers of this world. That seruante is wise, which knowinge that his
master whom he serves. intends to put him away, does determyne to forsake
him first, and take his leave of him. And since the world is such as does
forsake his friends in their chief time o^ need, the best is for thee to
forsake it, before it do forsake thee.

Gene. 21.
When Isaacke was borne, Abraham made no feast at all, but when he took him
from nourrisse and wayned him, then he made a great feast. When man is first
borne there is no cause of feast, because a man knows not what will become of
him, but when he is separated from this world, and wayned from all his
pleasures and delights, then ought we to make a feast for him.

Mat. 13,
Fly from the world and thou shalt find the treasor hidden in the field. He
which diggeth after any treasor, the nearer that he comes unto it* so much the
more withdraws he him self from the conversation and company of men, and
the nearer that he approaches it, so much more haste does he make in his work.
So do the holy and good men, the nearer that they draw unto death, the more
earnest they be about all good works, as though they began but even then to
labor.

He that did eat of the Pascall lamb, Exo. 12.
was first circumcised. And if thou do not first circumcise thy self, by
dryuing from thee the love of this world, and spoiling thine heart of all
sensual desires, thou shalt never taste of the spiritual food of the soul.

If thou had a great deal of good grain in a low bottom, and one
should tell thee that it marreth and corrupts in that place, thou would
straight way remove it thence, and carry it up to some higher room. But God
him self tells thee, that thine heart is corrupted and cast away here in
these low and base things of this world, and therefore would have thee to lift
it up toward heaven, and yet art thou unwilling to do it. Fly from this
unwholesome and contagious place, that thou may live for ever in the land of
the living.

IN NOTHING DOES THE world keep any assured stay, but co^tynuallie in every
thing makes nevve alterations and chaunges, and therefore ought not any man to
put any trust in it, but only to place all his confidence in God. CHAP. 25.
THOU have moved the earth, and it was troubled, close thou up the ruptures
thereof, Psalm. 59.
because it is so sore moved and shaken: says the Prophet David. The mutation
and change which the world makes so often, were sufficient to make it break
in pieces.

Luc. 21.
If a conyng carpenter or mason would tell thee, that the house where thou
dwell were like to fall down, would not thou quickelie get thee out of
it? But God him self who is the chief workman of all, does tell thee that
both heaven and earth shall pass away. 1 John. 2.
And S. John says: This world does pass away and the concupiscence thereof.
The three pillars, upon which the world is borne up (says S. John) are pride,
covetousness, and concupiscence of the flesh. Do not thou see ^owe these
three pillars on which the ^orlde stands, do tremble and shake? And yet
will thou stand still and not fly ^way?

Honors and vanities do fall away, and are moved and removed every day.
^arke how many chaunges and variations ^here have happened in these honors of
^he world: first the monarchy of the world ^egan with the Assirians, but it
stayed not ^here long, but passed thence to the Per^ians, from them again it
went to the Greeks, and contynuinge still in change and alteration, came at
last unto the Romans, and at this present the Empire is ^mongest the Almayns.
Now if the whole Empire which stands upon the highest ^oppe of worldly
honor, has gone so often about, what thing is there i^ this world that a man
may account to be stable and firm.

Riches and all sensual delights be much more subject to mutabilitie, and do
sooner pass away: Seeing then that the pillars of the world do tremble and
^hake, and be so frail and moveable, it is ^ dangerous thing for to live in a
world that is so mutable, and so ready to move continually: thou must fly
away, except ^hou be contented that it should fall upon thee and kill thee.

If the world which is always in readiness of falling be so much beloved, what
should it then be, if it were quiet and sta^ble? How would thou forsake it,
if it we^^ fair and bewtifull, if thou do now (...) much esteem it, being
foul and filthie^* What pleasure would thou take in it, if it should bring
thee fourth sweet flowers, that take such delight in these thorns and
brambles? Thou will not forsake the world, but continually follow it, and yet
does the world still forsake thee: put not thy trust in these present
things, which in truth can not well be called present, being in continual
motion and never standing still.

Do not thou take that for good quyetnes wherein there is not any perfec^^
rest at all: if thou do love those things that be moveable, thou must not
look (...) be thy self immovable. The sayler whether he will or no^, must
needs move when the ship moves: all things i^ this life be moveable and
not permane^^* to day they be, to morrow they be not, so that thou can not
have any perfect and assured contentment in them.

The name that does most aptely express almighty God is this word, Esse, to
be. He that is (said Moses) has sent me unto you, speakinge of God who sent
him to king Pharo. Exodus 3.
Of a mutable man* the common use is to say, that he has not the being of a
man, and therefore men will avoid to have any dealinge with him. And even so
is the world, It were good for ^^ee therefore not to have any thing to ^^e
therewith, or to enter in to any frend^^ipp with it. Love those things that
are ^f continuance and being, and not those ^^inges which for their variatio^
and chaun^ing have no perfect being at all.

It is a dangerous thing for thee to ^yue where contynuall earthquakes be, ^oe
not build thy house, where Cities do ^^se to fall, and kill the inhabitants.
^uyld upon a sure ground, where thou ^ayest live quyetlie, and in good
safety. ^et thy care be, to buyld thy house in ^eauen, which thou may be
sure is always firm and quiet. The wind of fla^erie, which is enclosed
within the bowels of the earth, (which be the Palaces of Princes and the
houses of great men,) when it seeks to break out, and to ascend ^o honor
and high dignities, is the cause of these great earthquakes in the world.
Make not thou thine habitatio^ in so dangerous a place. Seek not to dwell in
the Palaces of kings and Princes, for there are contynuall earthquakes, by
reason of the great wyndes of ambition that are there kept under, and covered
with hypocrisy, which breaking out at the last, do cause great disorders, and
unreasonable turmoyles.

Thou shalt daily see in the world continual alterations, and almost every
hour new chaunges: some thou shalt see rich to day, that were poor
yesterday, and some as poor again, that were before very rich: if thou do
laugh to day make no great reckening thereof, for th^^ may happily weep to
morrow, so mu^table is the world, that it will this day show thee a good
countenance, and (...) morrow again not once look upon thee* The sun shyneth
brighte and clear i^ the morning, but strayghte way comes there a cloud, and
turns all the fay^^ wether into a tempeste. What is all this, but for our
instruction, to teach us that i^ this world there is no stabilitie, but great
change and alteration in all things of this world? All hangs in doubtefull
balance, and such entermedling is there in it, that pleasure is no sooner
paste, but strayghte way enters sorrow and displeasure.

The mutabilitie that is in the world, is i^ nothing better expressed then in
the usage and handling of our blessed Savior, whom the people received in the
morning with great feast and joy, and in the euenyng folowinge, was forsaken
of them all. They went with green bows to receive him, and to welcome him in,
and within four days after, with dried bows they knocked him on the head.
They took of their garments, and strawed his way with them, as he should pass
by, and shortly after they spoiled him of his own clothes, both to beat him,
and to crucify him. They said first, blessed be he that comes in the name of
our Lord. Job. 19.
And sodeynlie after they changed their voice, and cried out alowde to Pilate,
that he should crucify him, for he was worthy of death. And at the same gate
that he en^red in with so much honor he went out again not long after with
much dishonor. Do not thou consider well this great and sudden change and
alteration? This is the end that those worldly honors do come unto.

If thou do now laughe, and pass ^hy life in pleasure, thou have much cause
^o fear, and to expect some evil to fo^ow soon after. Allthoughe the world
do show thee a fair face now at this present, yet trust thou not in it, for
it is mutable, light, and inconstant, without frendshipp or fidelity. But put
thy trust and confidence in God alone, for he is a sure and a firm friend, and
deal with no such fickle friend as this present world is.

HOW EVERY SIN BE IT never so small, ought to be avoided, and every
occasion eschevved, that may dravv a man into it, for one sin ever draws
on an other, And brings still more danger vvithall, to cast the soul away
at the last into eternal damnation. CHAP. 26.
FLEE from sin, as thou would from a serpent, Eccl. 21.
says the scripture. The frendshipp of this world is so prejudicial to the
integrity of a good conscience: that thou ought in no wise to conform thy
self unto it. For all that is in the world, is full of sin and vice, from
which it is good for thee, to withdraw thy self, as far of as thou can.

Ecclesiasticus likeneth the malice of sin unto a serpent. Which comparison,
(if the malice of sin be thoroughly considered,) will scarce be found
equal, when the malice of the serpent may easelie be avoided of any man, but
the malice of sin is hardly of any to be eschewed, and few there be that
do avoid it.

Seek to avoid not only great sins, but the small also. Esa. 14.
For as the prophet Esaias says, from the root of the serpent, comes fourth
the Basiliske. That fearful basiliske, which of all venomous beasts is the
chief, does proceed from the small serpent, which is always verefied, when
the great sin does grow of the little sin: And if thou do not avoid
that small serpent, that other great monstrous serpent the Basiliske will kill
thee, and utterly destroy thee. Except thou do separate thy self from
small sins, thou will easelie fall into greater. And because thou sholdest
fly from every small sin therefore art thou willed to fly from sin as
from a serpent.

In the shipp that thou saylest in, if thou do leave but a small hole for
the water to enter, by little and little the shipp will at the last be
overwhelmed with water, and thy self drowned therewith. Take away first small
inconuenyences, that thou fall not after into great mischeefes and dangers.

How small soever the sin seems, yet do thy best to avoid it, renounce
the world, and all that may conioyne thee to the world, fly much worldly
conversation, for though it seem to carry no sin with it, yet ministers
it great occasion of sin. Avoid all unnecessary practices, and idle
Jesting for thereof grows indeuotion, And when devotion is lost, how easy is
it to slip into the danger of any sin? Think not these to be small things,
for though that thou do so esteem them, yet if thou let them grow and
increase upon thee, they will go near to kill thy soul at the last. Kill
thine enemy when he is yet but little, for when he is grown up to his full
bigness, he will put thy life in hasarde.

It is every wise man's part to stand in some fear of his enemy, allthoughe
his force be but feeble. Hereof may thou take example by Cain, who because
he had no regard to a little coffeehouse of his brothers welfare, G^ne. 4.
at the first, suffered it so to grow and increase, that at the last it turned
into an extreme envy, which caused him to kill his brother. After which
murder committed, he fell into an error of faith, believing that God knew
nothing of his offense. And so last of all he fell into an utter desperation.
Abissus Abissum inuocat, one sin draws an other after, and of the small
sin grows the greater.

Be not thou therefore necgligent in lookinge well to the auoydinge of every
small sin. Thou had need to live warelie and vigilantlie, for all will be
little enough, when thou must live in a world so full of dangers. They that
are found unprovided, are sonest overcome. From every evil custom of sin
thou ought to fly, as from a pestilence, for death stands fast by: And if
thou give access unto his messenger which comes before him, he will follow
soon after him self, and distroye thee.

One of the plagues of Egypt, was certain small flies, which troubled them
with sucking of their blood. This was but a small plague, but by and by after
followed an other plague, which were great flies, which cruelly tormented the
Egiptians. After the less plague came still the greater, and after a small
temptation follows a greater. Except thou take heed by the first thou shall
be tormented with the second, as king Pharao was, And so infinitelye one
folowinge an other, until utter destruction made an end of all.

Ecclesiasticus says, He that necglecteth small matters shall fall at last
into great dangers. Eccl. 19.
When thou think a thing to be small, thou make no acco^pte thereof, and
thy little esteeming of yt, makes it the more dangerous unto thee. He that
has in use not to esteem of light harms, perceyueth not the greater, when
they do fall. And in great faults must he needs fear the less, that used
in small faults to fear nothing at all.

The Apostle least the Corinthians should fall into great offenses, by
settinge nothing by the less, says unto them. Be not ye Idolaters, as some of
the^ have been which fell first to eatinge, and drinkinge, 1. Cor. 10
and after fell to committ Idolatry. Because they did not keep (them selves
from surfeyting and bibbing, they fell into the greater offense of adoring
Idols.

Have in hatred all small sins, fly from all that which may bring thee into
the way of danger, and destruction, for he which despises his enemy, and
sets nothing by him, is the more likely to be destroyed by him.

THE COMPANY AND Conversation of evil men, is to be fled from, for the great
danger that good men do stand in thereby. CHAP. 27.
HE that touches pitch shall be defiled therewithal, Eccl. 13.
And he that keeps company with a proud man, will wax proud him self says
God. There is no desease be it never so infectiue, that will so soon catch
hold of a man, as evil customs will do, through the conversation of evil
men. Fly the company of evil men, if thou will be ^he seruante of Jesus
Christ.

There be many noughtie men which the devil uses as his ministers, and
sends them about to hunte after good men: and many wicked men do more harm
by their evil examples, then some thieves and murderers do. Thieves do take
away our bodily goods, but the wicked do rob our souls of the treasor of
virtue: so much as the soul is more noble the^ the body, so much more ought
thou to eschew the company of evil men, then the company of those that be
infected with contagious deseases.

VVorldly men with their evil company do move the ha^^ of man to follow their
vices, and although their works be no persuasions, nor inforcements to sin,
yet be they shrewde temptations to move thereunto: for the good man seeing the
wicked man do evil, is stirred thereby to follow him.

God commanded the Israelites that they should not marry with the Gentiles,
Deu. 7.
to the intent they should not learn their evil customs by keeping company
with them. The children of Seth, which were good, because they joined them
selves to the children of Caine which were naught became also vicious like unto
them, for which cause God sent after the great water of the floode.

That holy prophet whom God sent unto Samaria, 3* Re* 13.
was slain of a lion by the way, because he did eat and drink in the company
of the false lying prophet. Iosaphat the good king of Judah being but in the
company of Achab that was bad, 3 Re. 22.
was welneare slain for his labor, and he was bitterlye rebuked therefore by
the prophet of God: vices be sooner learned then virtues, and therefore beware
of the company of the wicked which is most pernicious.

The Jews which were the elect people of God, because that they conuersed, and
kept company with the Gentiles, they were reprehended by the prophet Esaias,
Esa. 1.
saying: Thy wine is mingled with water: wine being mingled with water does
lose his strength and virtue. So if one be good and do practice and keep
company with those which be naught, he loses part of his spiritual force.
And by little and little, the fervor of his devotion waxes cold in him.

Allthoughe thou do not loose the virtue (which thou put in great
adventure) yet to grow slack in the service of God, is a fault not to be
neclected. And yet if that should not happen, which were almost impossible, yet
shall thou loose at the least thy good name, for though the wine being mingled
with water, do not utterly loose his force and virtue, yet must it needs
loose the color. And so shall thou loose the good opinion that men had of thee.
For if men do see thee converse with those that be vicious, they will take
thee for such as those be, with whom thou do converse. For if thou will
thoroughly know a man what he is, do but mark what his friends be, with whom
he keeps company, for every like does delight to be with his like. And he
that once knows with whom thou use to keep company, will quickelie after
know thee also.

For that cause did Elin reprehend Job saying, Job. 34*
who is Job that walks with those which do evil, and keeps company with
those that be lewd? It is a great sign that he is naught, which keeps
contynual company with those which be naught. To be good amongst those which
be naught is as hard a thing as to swymme against the streme.

It is a vearie hard thing to live innocentlie amongst those that be bad.
Gene. 19.
There were but a few that lived as loath did, in the midst of Sodom, whom
God sent his holy Angel to deliver out of that lewd City, that he should
not perish amongst the wicked there. And Job of all other is highly to be
commended, who living amongst sinners, continued for all that good still. Phi.
2.
The Apostle praised the Philippians, because they shyned like bright la^pes,
dwellinge amongst wicked people. It is a praise proper to the Church of God
that it still florisheth like a lilly amongst thorns. Can. 2*


It is a vearie hard thing, that the tender and delicate lilly should save it
self whole and perfect amongst the sharp and pricking thorns. God said
unto Ezechiell. ^ze. 2.
The destroyers and unbelieving people do abide with thee, and with the
scorpions is thine habitation.

Now if it be so hard a thing to live well amongst the wicked, It follows
that it is great danger to have conversation and friendship with them.

If thou will save thy soul, fly with Loath from the cursed Sodom, which is
this world, and the inhabitants thereof, and save thy self upon the top of
the hill keeping company with the servants of Jesus Christ.

THE COMMODITIES AND comfortes that are found by them that keep company with
those which be good, be great and many, as is proved by sundry examples, out
of the old and new testament. CHAP. 28.
WITH the holy thou shalt be holy, Psalm. 17.
and with the innocente thou shalt be innocent: (says the prophet David.)
If thou keep company with the good, thou shalt not know how nor when thou
profitest, but yet thou shalt find well that thou have profited by them: draw
near to the good and thou shalt be one of them.

Saul being amongst the prophets became a prophet, and did prophecy, 1. Re.
10.
and amongst fools he became a fool. Mat. 26.
S. Peter being amongst the Apostles which were good men, confessed Christ to
be the son of God, but after in Cayfas his house where he was with the wicked
assembled together, there did he deny him. It seems hereby, that a great
alteration was made in the man, by reason of the company that he was withal:
then may thou think, and be well assured that they with whom thou use to
keep company, may well work as great effect in thee.

With the good thou shall be good, and with the bad thou shalt be like unto
them. If thou put dead coals amongst the quick burning coals, they will
soon be on a fire. Draw thou near unto the burning coals, which be the
virtues of good men, for though thou be never so much wasted and consumed, by
thine own evil life, yet the good me^ with their virtues, will reuyue thee,
and quicken thee again.

God did make Laban to prosper well because that Jacob was in his house, which
Jacob told him saying. Gene. 31.
Thou had but little before that I came unto thee, and now has God
enriched thee by my coming. Gene. 39.


God blessed the house of Pharao the Egiptian king, and multiplied it
exceedingly, because of that virtuous young man Joseph that was in it. For the
love of good king Iosaphat Elizeus the Prophet did miraculouslie give water
unto the Armies of two noughtie kings that were in his company. 4. Reg. 3*
The scripture is full of many such miraculous examples, by which it is evident
what they have gained and gotten that have kept company, with good and virtuous
men.

S. Thomas because he did separate him self from the rest of his fellows* Io.
2.
did not see Christ when he rose again. And when he joined him self in
company with them again, our redeemer appeared unto him, and so of an
unbelieving disciple, was made a faithful and true disciple. And as much as he
lost by deuyding him self from the good, so much did he get and recover
again by uniting him self unto them. It is a dangerous thing to forsake the
company of them that do fear God. And it is a thing of wonderful profit to
be conversant amongst spiritual men.

The holy Ghost descended upon VVhitsonday where the disciples were gathered
together. Act. 1.
And if thou will contynew amongst good men, thou shalt receive the holy
Ghost as they did: thou shalt deliver thy self from the danger of evil
company, if thou will join thy self to those which be good: with their
wholesome admonitions they do keep thee from many evil attemptes, and with
their virtuous examples do they excyte thee to do good works. Choose those
for thy companions to walk withal, to talk unto, and to imitate, by whose
sweet conversation, and fruytfull communication, thou may be brought unto
the love of God. For evil speeches do corrupt good manners. 1. Cor. 15.


As necessary and as profitable as it is for the health of thy body to have a
good air, and an wholesome situation, so necessary is it for the health of thy
soul, to have conference and conversation with the servants of God. And since
thou fliest from unsound and unwholesome places, for the co^seruatio^ of thy
corporal health why do not thou likewise, for the may^enance of thy souls
health?

Fly from all worldly company and seek out for the friendship and
conversation of those which are good and just: Fly worldly company as thou
would fly hell fire, and converse with the friends of God, for at the end
of thy journey thou shalt get more by it, then thou can now well imagine.

ONLY FOR THE LOVE OF God, and for the desire of obeying his holy will, ought
man to despise the world, and the vanities therefore, if he will that the
despising of them shall serve him for the gettinge of heavenly glory. CHAP.
29.
HE that leaves his house, his father and mother, and his brothers for my
sake, Mat. 19.
shall receive a hundred times as much again (says our Lord.) Many have
forsaken their possessions, and never received reward therefore, because they
despised not the world for Christ's sake. They seek them selves, they love
their own glory and desire to be talked of in other men's mouths. So much
shall thy work be meritorious, as it shall be found to bear just weighte
with it, i^ the balance of God his love.

1. Cor. 13.
The Apostle says: If I shall give all that I have to the poor, and have no
charity, it profits me nothing. Let all thy desire and pleasure be to
content and to please God, and let his love only move thee to the service of
him, despisinge wholly this world, and pretending to thy self no profit or
commodity thereby.

God praised Job, and the devil replied again, saying. Job. 1.
Happily does Job serve thee for nothing? This devil pleaded his cause
subtillie with almighty God, for he denied not the works of Job to be good,
but he argued upon his intent, saying that happily he did them for his own
commodity, and not freely of good will. For if Job had been moved to do
those works which he did for his own interest and profit, and not for the
love and glory of God, he had proved by good reason to God almighty, that
Job had been neither a just man, nor a good man.

The seruante of God ought in all that he does, to have no other respect
principally, but unto the service and honor of God, if he will that his work
shall be meritorious unto him, for the wicked men do many good moral works,
but the difference is, that good men do their works in the faith of God for
his love. It is against all reason that the goods of the earth should be
preferred before God. Art thou better then he, that thou do esteem thy
self more then his deuyne Majesty?

If thou do forsake sin, either only or principally because God should
give thee glory therefore, thou shall never enter into that glory. Or if thou
despisest the world, and leauest sin only or chiefly, because thou would
not come in hell, thou have taken even thereby a ready way thither. For if thou
co^siderest all this well, thou shalt find that it proceeds from the love
of thy self, and if thou do examine well thine own intention and meaning
herein, thou shalt see how the love that thou haste to thy self, does inuyte
thee and move thee thereunto: and then art not thou full lord of thy self,
neither art thou thoroughly mortified, neither can thou yet tell what thing
it is to serve God.

Do not thou think, that all they which have forsaken their temporal goods,
have therewith also forsaken them selves: nor that all they be the friends of
God that do despise the world. But who is the friend of God in deed? Even he
that does forsake the world for God. And who is the servant of Jesus Christ.
Even he that has no will in this world, but to fulfill the will of Christ.

The Prophet David said, I have inclyned my heart to do thy commandments
for a reward. Psa. 118.
The reward that moved that holy man David, was God him self: According unto
that which God him self had told the Patriarch Abraham long before saying,
Gene. 15
I am thy great, and thine abundant reward. God ought only to move thee
principally, and thy will ought to be chiefly to have him for the reward of
all that thou shall do. Let al thine intention be only to please God, and
thou shall merit much, 1. Cor. 10.
even by the smalest works that thou do, which ought not yet to be called
small, when they do proceed out of that root.

Seek only the glory of God, and follow the counsel of the Apostle which
says. 1. Cor. 10.
Do all that thou do for the glory of God. The perfect true lover seeks
God in all that he does, and despises him self, for charity is a bond of
love, by the which we be united unto God, renouncing our selves.

Although that natural love, and divine love, be like in their outward
workinge, yet be they far differinge in the ^ntention, for charity does not
in any thing love it self, and natural love does ^n all things seek his
own good, only for it self: He may well and ought to be esteemed an evil
man, that is good only for his own pleasure and delighte. Let Christ be the
cause and the end of all thine actions, if thou will not loose thy time in the
poing of them.

THE CONTINVAL REMEMbrance of death, and that our bodies must be turned into
Ashes, is the perfectest, and the best remedy against the temptation of sin.
CHAP. 30.
REMEMBER the last things and thou shall not sin for ever. Eccl. 7.
The memory of death helps much, to make us lightly to esteem the vanity
of this world. He will easelie despise all things, that remembers he must die.

Gene. 3.
God appareled our father Adam with the skynnes of dead beasts, because he
should have ever in his memory the sentence of death, which he fell into by his
sin Seek not thou to live in pleasure, since that thou see all pleasant
things contemned and abhorred of them* that are condemned to dye, and thy
self carrying the sentence of death about thee, and drawing daily toward thy
grave, thou ought to spend this short time of thy life in contynuall sorrow,
and sighinge for thy sins.

It is a sovereign medecyne for to refrain thy sensual appetites withal,
(...) have in thy mind, the consideration of the ^mall time that thou have to
remain here, And in how short space thy body shall after be eaten with
woormes, and converted unto dust. This remembrance of death does ^s it were
throw water into the furnace of our hot fiery appetites and desires.

Death is the clock by which we set our life in an order, and the memory
thereof does choke up all that earnest love that we do bear unto the world.

As Daniell with throwing of ashes in the flore, Dan. 14.
discovered by the printe of the feet the deceyte of the false priests of
Babylon. So if thou will sprincle thy memory a little with those wholesome
ashes into which thou must within a while be converted, thou shalt likewise
discover the deceytes of the world, the craft and subtlety of the devil,
and the secret temptations, with which the enemies of thy soul do seek to
undermine thy salvation.

O that this thought would never fall out of thy remembrance with what
cleannes of conscience sholdest thou live, what bitterness sholdest thou then
find in those things which now do seem so sweet unto thee, and how
warelie then would thou walk in the way of this miserable life, which thou
do now so inordinatlie love.

At that strayte passage of death shall thou know how much it had been better
for thee to have served God, then to have consumed and spent out thy time,
which is so precious a thing in vanities and idle business, which at that time
will do the no good. Thy friends and kynnesfolkes, thy riches, and temporal
goods, of which thou make now so great account: O how little good shall
all these do thee then, when as a pure conscience at that time* shall stand
thee in better stead, then to have had the whole world under thine obedience.
The trauayll of that hard passage* with tongue cannot be expressed, nor by any
means escaped.

The maryner, that guydeth the ship, sytteth always at the stearne, so must
thou, that wilt sail in the tempesteous Sea of this world* seek for thy
assurance in the end of thy life, where thou must stand as it weere at the
stearne of the shipp and there by contemplation of death, consider well how
thou may govern the course of thy whole life.

Ashes do preserve, and keep in the fire, And the memory of Ashes into which
thou art to be converted, preserves grace. Great folly is it then, for a
mortal man, that is daily dying, to forget death. It is wisdom for every
man to have it always in his mind. But worldly men have always life in
their remembrance, and put death clean out of their mind, and yet nothing
dryueth sin away from man so much as the contynuall remembrance of death.
Happy is he* that carries daily before his eyes the remembrance of ^eath,
and continually disposes him self to die.

Happy is he, that thinks in the morning that he shall not live till night,
and at night thinks likewise that he shall dye before the morning come:
happy is he, that is so prepared, as death does never find him unprepared:
happy is he, that seeks to be such in this life, as he would be found when
death comes.

It is reason that thou sholdest believe the thing, which thou see daily
before thy face. At all hours and times of thy life, let that dreadful sound
of the trumpet ring in thy ear, which will call ^lowd: Rise up all ye that
be dead, Mat. 24.
and come unto judgment. The memory of death, does cleanse and purify all*
that passes through it, as a strayner cleanses all the liquor, that is powered
into it. Drive not from thee the memory of death: which many ways does thee
great good: it makes thee to refrain from the revenge of those iniures, which
thou thoughtest to have revenged. And it keeps the from the folowinge of the
pleasures and vanities of this world.

Do, as the seruante of God ought to do, that is, forget all such like
vanities, and have the hour of thy death fixed in thy memory, to the intent
that thou may get that true life eternal, whereby thou may live in
bliss for ever.

WHEN EACH MAN LABOVreth so earnestly to bring any vvorldly business to pass
by some certain ty^^ appointed him, much more ought (...) to labor earnestly
about his souls b^sines, and do penance for his sins, life being so
short, and the hour of death so uncertain. CHAP. 31.
Mat. 25.
WATCH (says our Lord) because ye know, neither the day nor the hour.
Death being so certain, (...) the time so uncertain, thou ought to watch
continually: for when thy life is ended, tho^ can not change that state in
which death did find thee: thou ought so to or^dayne every day, as though
that day sho^^ be thy last.

Many do build houses, not knowing whether they shall dwell in them after
they be made. Many do make great pro^uision for victual for the year that
^^^eth, and happily they do not live to (...) it: they prepare for a life
which is altogy^ther uncertain, and have no care of dea^^ which is most
certain: they seek (...) ^ll care and diligence for that time which ^hey
know not whether it shall come or ^o, and be altogether necgligent in
prepa^ing for death, which they know shall ^urely come. And seeing thou
prouidest ^or uncertain things with so much care, that is the cause that thou
make not ^rouision for death, that is so certain to ^ome? It is not meet
nor convenient that ^hou sholdest leave the certaynetie for the ^ncertainetie.

The days that we have to live be vn^erteine, and very sure it is, that they
must ^ll needs shortly have an end. Never ^aue thou any great care of such
things ^s thou art uncertain whether they shall^e or no? But let thy care and
diligence be ^o provide for thy self, and to prepare for that hour which thou
art vearie sure will ^hortlie come. No man knows his end, (...) therefore the
wise man says. Eccl. 19
As fishes ^e taken with the hook, and birds with ^he net, so shall sinners
be taken in the day of vengeance. When a thing is near at ^and and certain
to come, thou do account of yt, as of a thing already past, that cause is
there the^, but that thou shol^est so think of death also, which stands
^till ready at thy door to lay hold on thee, And to prepare for yt, as for a
thing rather present with thee, then far of from thee!

If a king should give thee his grant of some great city or town of his
kingdom, And should but allow thee one hour to get thy conueyance thereof to
(...) assigned unto thee: O with what dilig^^^^ would thou go about, to get
it drawn and written out fair for the king to sign^* lest the time should
ouerpasse thee, and so thou sholdest loose so great a grace a^ the kings
hand. No other business should let thee, nor occasion stay thee, but tha^ thou
would only apply thy self to get the confirmation of thy grant. But the
heavenly city of Jerusalem, which the great king of heaven has promised
us, is a far greater, and better City, then all the Cities, and kingdoms of
the world b^ besides. The glory of this City and the eternal felicity
thereof, unto the which we labor to come, far exceeds all the
principalities and empires of the whole world. This notable kingdom is that
which God of his bountiful liberality does grant unto thee. And this short
space of this present life, is the time, that is given thee to deserve it in.
The night of death draws on, Io. 9.
when no man shall be able to work.

No man has one hour sure of his life, the time whereof being so short, and
the promyses of God being so large and liberal, how happens it, that so
many do spend their days in idleness and vanities, as though they were sure
to ly^^ an hundredth years, and that after this life, there were no other to be
looked for*

If thou do so toil thy self here by ^osinge of so many nights sleeps,
forbearinge thy meat and drink so many meals, ^y forgoing of all thy other
pleasures, and ^ll to make have for the gayning of a temporal commodity,
which else thou migh^est forgo: why do thou not (in this short space that is
granted thee to live) ^eaue all worldly business and occupations, and bestow
all the whole time of thy life, ^n gettinge that durable and everlasting ^yfe?
Be not thou idle, nor live not like one that were blind, neither deceive ^hou
thy self with the vain hope of to morrow, which perhapes thou shall never see

Those five foolish Virgins, Mat. 25.
that had time given them to make provision for them selves would not, but did
put of their ^are still until the time were past, would gladly after have had
time, and earnestly sought for it, but none would be granted them.

Put not any trust in the time that is to come. Thou have not to take care for
a ^onge life, but for a good life, neither ought thy trauayll be to live many
years but to bestow well those years which thou do live.

Saul reigned twenty years in Israel, 3. Re. 13.
but the scripture in the account of the years of his reign sets down
but two: For God accompteth not the yeare^ that be evil spente, but those
which be ^pente only in his service. Thy labor had need to be greater in
taking pain to live well, then to live long. Spend not thy time still in
proposing and determynyng with thy self to live well, but put thy
determinations into practice, and see that thou lyuest well in deed.

There be many in hell, which deferring still their penance, were at the last
overtaken with death, and so their cold determynations with out executions
were buried up in the hot fire of hell.

The hour of death is uncertain, and the consideration thereof alone is
sufficient to make thee live still in care, that thou be never taken unprovided.

It were madness for thee to live i^ that state, in which thou would not that
death should find thee. And because that this may happen unto thee at any
hour, reason alone may teach thee to live well, for the doubt which thou have
of the uncertain hour of thy death.

BECAUSE THAT EVERY man should still be prepared, and that no man should take
license to sin, our Lord will not that the hour of our death should be
known unto us. CHAP. 32.
THE days of man's life be short, Job. 14.
and God knows only the number of the months: says Job. Nothing is more
sure then death, nor any thing more unsure then the hour of death. Thou
know not at what hour of the watch our Lord will call.

In concealing from us the hour of death, Mat. 23.
God has thereby taught us that we should not presume of any long life, but
that we should in this short space of our tarying here, look that every hour
should be our last. And in this, as in all other things beside, God has
dealte most mercifully with us, in keeping from our knowledge the hour of
death, to the intent that we should live with more purity and cleannes of
heart.

Such as we shall be found at the hour of death, for such shall we be judged
at the hands of almighty God: and since experience does daily teach us, that
we may dye in every moment, let us live innocentlie, that we may be found in
no arrerages at our counting day. And so much more fervent ought thou to be
in thy doing of good deeds, as thou art uncertain of the hour when thou
shall be called: and since the time when thou shall dye is uncertain, thou
ought always to be ready and prepared, for to receive death. If there be
many now which do live in the offense of God, having the day of their death
uncertain, how many more would there be much worse, if they should know
certeinlie the end of their life? They would defer their penance, and commit
many more offenses upon that assurance.

If men do live lewdelie now, being not sure to continue until to morrow, in
what sort would they live, if they might be sure to live here an hundredth years?

The ignorance of the last hour, makes many to absteyne from sin: And if
some men do happily give them selves a little to the world, yet do they not
wholly addict them selves thereunto, for the fear that they have of the
sudden coming of death upon them, which they would not do, if they knew they
should live many years: for then it is most manifest that they would with more
negligence, and forgetfulness of God, give them selves unto vice. And allthoughe
that the uncertainty of death does not keep a man all together from sin, at
the leastwyse, yet it makes him not to continue therein, so long as else he
would.

If wicked men knew the hour of their death, they would be much worse then
they be. Many dare not sin, lest death should take them whylest they be
doing it.

If a man might know surely the hour of his death, yet is it plain that he
cold not know it, but under one of these two conditions, that is to say,
either that he should dye very suddenly, or else have some certain time after
appointed and prefixed him to dye in: and if he should know that he should dye
suddenly, his penance being upon a sudden, were like to be very dangerous and
doubtefull: and if on the other side, he should know his time to be lengthened
for a longer space, then would he take more occasion to sin, deferring his
penance until the very last day, both which ways would be very dangerous
and inconvenient for his salvation.

An hasty penance, and a vain deferring of penance are both very hurtful
to a man's conscience: to deliver thee from both these inconveniences, the
providence of God has so ordained, that the hour of thy death should not be
made known unto thee, but kept secret from the, and that thou sholdest
always stand in some awe of death, because thou sholdest still seek how to
live a virtuous life* thou art much bound unto God, that by keepinge secret
from thee, the hour of thy death, has given thee thereby, a singular occasion
to live well and to work thine own salvation. And in that point shows be
his mercy vearie much, that by keeping thee from the certeintie of death, does
give thee occasion daily to convert thee unto him, lest thou sholdest be taken
unprovided, for if the day had been set down certain unto thee, thou would
have multiplied and increased thy sins vearie much? Also God would not that
thou sholdest know the day of thy death, because he would have thee for to
live for the profit and commodity of other and not for thine proper benefit
only.

The common commodity is to be preferred, before the private and particular.
And if thou knew that thou sholdest die shortly, thou would leave many
good works to do, which should redounde to the benefit of others, and only
occupying thy self about thine own proper commodity, thou would have care
of none, but of thy self, and so wholly forget thy neighbors.

And if again on the other side: when a man is sick, if he should know
surely that that sickness should not be his last sickness, he would neither
confess him self, nor receive any of the sacraments, neither call on God
and his Saints, nor procure the prayers of his friends, nor the common
suffrages of the Church to be said for him. All these good works with many
more would he omit, if he should know for certentie, that he should then recover
and not die.

Many in their sickness do turn unto God, thynkinge that they shall die,
which they would not do, if they knew surely that they should live. Further
also did God provide, and most wyse^ie ordeyne, that men should not know the
end of their life, both for humayne conversation, and also for a quiet and
peaceable trade of living amongst men. For if men did know that they should
live many years, they would seek to revenge the^ of all their injuries, and
grow full of hatred and malice. And again if they should know, that they
should quickelie die, they would go up and down all heavy and discontented,
and would in all company and conversation, be vearie unpleasant and noisome to
their neighbors, and those that must keep them company and live with them.
And so by both those means, they should disturb the common peace and ci^ill
conversation of men.

All this has God done for our p^ofit and commodity, whom we have always
just cause in all his doings to praise, to love, and to serve for ever.

THERE IS NO OTHER Medecin so good against death, as the often meditation of
death, for yt causes a man so to live, as at the hour of his death he
overcomes death and begins a happy and a perpetual life. CHAP. 33.
ALTHOUGH thou do live many years in joy and gladness, Eccl. 11.
yet must thou have always in thy mind the dark day of death: says the
wise man. Death would be vanquished as soon as he should come, if it were well
thought on before it come.

No weapon will so well defend thee from death, as the very memory of death it
self: nothing shall so easily deliver thee from death as the often meditating
thereon. A wise man's life is the meditation of death: he is unworthy of
comfort in his death, that in his life was clean forgetful of death.

Mat. 17.
Christ in his glorious transfiguration, took with him Moses, who was dead,
because that in our temporal glory we should have always death before our
eyes: death which we see to be so contrary to life, almighty God him self
took as a means to gain us life by.

Jesus Christ has by his blessed death, so qualified and tempered death unto
us, that it is now no longer death, but an instrument for us to attain
everlasting life by, for by death we do gain eternal life. So as that which
before his glorious death, was vearie death in deed, is now become life to
all good men, and to all wicked men it is a sure port of everlasting death. It
is the table of account, or the place of payment, where the true knighte, and
the faithful soldier is paid his wages, and the faint hearted coward turned
out of pay and discharged. Death does give his hyre diversely, according to
the diversity of men's lives. Seek to be of the Number of those, which shall be
well rewarded. Thou shall not fall on the right hand of death, if thou do
not forget death in thy life time.

It is the chief point of philosophy, to be exercysed still in the
conte^plation of death. The father of the householde commanded his servants
to go seek out in the ways for geastes to come unto his feast, Mat. 22.
and that they should watch at the ends and corners or angles of the high
ways, to bring them unto him. And for as much as we be all trauaylers and
wanderers in this world, God would that we should consider well the end of our
way which is death. Carry always before thynes eyes the consideration
thereof, and do not live in blyndnes.

The Ninevites hearing the sentence of death pronounced against them by Jonas
the Prophet, they straight ways fell to penance. Behold how much good the
memory of death does work in man, when it made so sudden, and so great an
alteration in those sinners hearts. If thou do meditate well of death,
temptation shall never overcome thee. Beware that thou love not so this life,
that thou do thereby forget death, for then do thou die most of all, when
thou have best good will, and most desire to live.

The memory of death keeps a man from being to high minded in prosperity.
It is a good thing to be ready to welcome death before he come, and to expect
with good will the time that is to follow after death.

If thou do see others die before thee, thou may well know that thou art
walking that same way, although for the present time thou think thy self
to stand still and move not.

When two ships meet upon the Sea together, they that be in the one ship
do think, that they which be in the other, do sail exceedinge fast, and
that them selves go but fair and softelie, or rather stand still, although in
truth they sail as fast as the others do which they see pass by them. So
many which do see others die daily before their face, do think that them
selves be immortal, and that they do stand stock still, whilst others do
go on a pace toward death.

If death do come upon a sudden, and do carrye any man away with him,
never say that he plays the traitor with him, since that he has long ago
proclaimed him self for an open enemy to us all. And it is a plain token
that he never means to make a perfect peace, that every day is killinge some
one or other. So that if he do take thee unprovided, the fault must needs be
thine, seeing he threateneth thee daily, and thou will never beware. Thou must
still look for him, and think of him, as of one that were present with thee,
and so shall he never catch thee like a traitor by treason. If thou
considerest well of death, thou will live with some fear in thy life.

They which go through the fields when they be covered with snow, their
eyes do so dasell, that they can skant see any thing when they be entered into
their house, and therefore were it great peril for them to come into any
place where danger were: Even so the glisteringe brightness of this worldly
prosperity, does so dymme the eyes of worldly men that have passed through
it, that when they once enter into the next life, through the passage of
death, they can see nothing, but blindly run into the pit of perdition. Into
such confusion do these worldlings run, through their overmuch delighting in
worldly pleasures, and the little consideration of their own estates and
conditions: and no maruayle is it that they do then feel poverty, which
lived before in wealth over wantonly, and that they do taste of sorrow after
they be dead, which in their life, took all their fill of pleasure and
worldly vanity.

It is but meet, that he which in his life forgets him self, should when
he dies forget God also: at that time the worldly man can have no full sight
of his own salvation, by reason of the glistering light of this false
deceyuable world which does so dim his eyes.

The remedy that such a one has, is first to sit without at the door of his
house, and there look well about him, and settle firmly his eye sight
again. And when he has shaken of the dymnes of his sight, which the earnest
beholdinge of those shyning visible things did dasell his eyes withal, then
may he safely enter into his house, and never indaunger him self at all.
After this manner in this life, must thou behold death considering what the
glory of this world is worth, and the vain honors and riches thereof.

3 Re. 19.
Elias stood at the door of his little cabine, where he did still meditate and
contemplate upon celestial things. And here in the contemplation of death
shall thou see like an other Elias, how the fury of gods wrath does consume
all these worldly things, and brings them to an end. And here shall thou
further see also as Elias did, how that God is not in the flamynge fire of
these disordinate desires of the world, neither in the honors, nor the stately
dignities thereof. The fire and the wind also passed away a pace before
Elias, and so do all worldly honors, pleasure, and prosperity pass away in
have, and do never stay.

Think earnestly on death, and consider the vanities of this life, that by,
the despisinge of this short and deceyuable life, thou may get the eternal
and true happy life.

HOW GOD SENDS tribulation unto man, to conquer pride in him, which is the
beginning and root of all his misery, and does accompany him that is
subject, unto it i^ (...) his actions and thoughts. CHAP. 34.
ALL that is in the wor^^ (says Saint John) eyth^^ it is the desire or
longing (...) the eyes, 1. Io. 2.
or the concupisce^^^ of the flesh, or pride of lyf^* These be the three square
battles wi^^ the which the world does fight against v^* These be the three
armies that the Chaldeans made for the overthrowing of ho^y Job. With honors,
riches, and with plea^sures, does the world assault all thos^ which are borne
to be soldiers in the field of this life: but pride amongst the rest does
rush in with most violence an^ indaunger most the soul of man. Eccl. 10.
For the root of all evil is pride, says the wise man*

If thou will give thy self unto God fly from the pride of the heart, Ia. 4.
for Go^ resists the proud hearted, and unto the humble does he give his
grace. The waters of gods grace, do pass away from ^he mountains of the
vain and high minded people* and does run into the valleys of them that be
humble and meek spirited.

Do but consider who thou art, and ^hou shall see how little cause thou have
to ^e proud. Thou shall find thy concep^ion to be sin, thy birth misery,
thy ^yfe pain, and thy death anguysh and tor^ent.

Almighty God to tame and subdue ^y pride withal has so ordained, that ^^ou
sholdest be vexed here in this life, ^ith the most vile and simple creatures of
^is making, such as he sent to plague the ^giptians withal, as gnattes, and
frogs, ^^d other small vermyne, to the end that ^^ou might know how much
without (...) reason thou art proud, when thou art ^biect to the molestation
and offense of (...) small and simple things.

Do not thou proudelie esteem, and ^ake account of thy virtues, by compa^^ng
and conferring them with the defects (...) faults of other men, but humbly
look ^^on thine own defectes, and consider ^ithall the virtues of thy
neighbors. If ^^ou do lay thine own faults before ^^yne eyes, and the
virtues of thy neigh^^urs withal, thou shall happily find ^y self to be a
sinner, and thy neighbor Saint. Luc. 18.
Be not like unto the proud ^aris^y, that reckened up his own ver^es, and the
Publicans faults? Tell rather thine own faults, and let other men ha^ the
care to tell of thy virtues.

Be not proud nor high minded* lest thou do fall into the most rigorou^
punnyshement of God for the same. Number 6*
Mo^^ is waxen proud (says God). Thou have not in thee, whereof to be proud,
but rather deseruest shame and confusion* Look a little into thy self, and
behold within thee what thou art. Thou arte^ vile woorme of the earth, and a
de^^^ full of filth and abomination. Remember that thou art but earth, and
shall turn into Ashes. Exodus 9.
Moses threw up ashes into the air, and there followed after it a grea^^ plague
amongst the Egiptians. And y^ thou being but ashes, do lift up and extol
thy self by pride, thou shall be pu^^nished also as they were. Because that
Na^buchodonoser did advance him self by pride, he was deprived of his
kingdom.

Thou can not by any fault so much resemble the devil, as by pride. The
de^uill has a particular domynion over the proud man, according to the
saying o^ Job. Job. 41.
There is he prince over the children of pride. To cure this great sin of
prid^ God him self came humbly hither (...) the earth.

Eccl. 10.
Pride is the beginning of eueri^ sin. All other sins do separate (...)
from God, by certain means, as pleasure profit, or commodity. But the curse^
proud man is so shameless and impude^^ ^^at he even face to face refuses God,
and ^eparteth away from him. Other vices do ^ot show them selves at all times,
for at ^any times they which have them, be without the disordinate thurst of
their ^esires. The sensual man is some times ^ee from his passions, and the
glutton ^hen his belly is full desires no more ^eate, but pride shewethe it
self in the ^roude man in all things that he does. ^Vhen he speaks,
works, appareleth, ^uyldeth, eats, or sleeps, he is always ^roude still.
He shows his pride in his ^^mptuous tables whereat he sits: In ^is costly
beds wherein he lies, in his ^^rmentes wherewith he appareleth. No ^^ce is
so apparante as pride. It is a con^^nuall ague that lasts still, and follows
^ man often, yea even when he is dead. ^Vhereof are witnesses the proud
state^^e monumentes and toumbes, which they ^^use to be set up and erected for
them, ^^ter they be laid in their graves.

Sometime for the avoiding of pride, ^^od permits a man to fall into other
^^nnes, so as that makes clear proof, ^^at it is of all other sins the
vearie ^^eatest, for great sins be never suffered, ^ut only for the avoiding
of other that ^^e greater. Prou. 8.
Pride and arrogancy of heart ^^e always most detestable before God.

The proud man,) says Job) stretched ^ut his hand against God, and labored
against the almighty. And it is written in the proverbs of Solomon: That
amonge^^ proud men there is always strife an^ contention. With other sinners
there i^ some conversation to be had, but with the proud man, Prou 13.
there is none at all, for he loves to be singular, and will be always
contentious, and may abide no company but him self. The Prophet Samuel said
unto Saul. When thou wast little in thine own sight, Reg. 15.
thou wast chief amongst all the tribes of Israel. Pride is the root of all
vice, and the destruction of all virtue.

The trees that be planted upon high^ places, be soonest blown down with the
wind. Love well to be little, and esteem of humility, for therein shall thou
find most safety.

OUR GREAT AND MIGHTY God, does love humility in man, and therefore in all
ages the humble be most aduaunsed, and the more that one does humble him self,
the more nighe does he dravve to God. CHAP. 35.
HE that humbles him self shall be exalted: Luc. 18.
(says God) Fly from the cursed vice of pride, unto which the world does
inuyte thee, and take ^umilitie for thy refuge: as much as pride ^s hateful to
God, so much is humility ^cceptable unto him: This is the sweet ^pouse of
Jesus Christ, so dearly beloved of him, that he never suffered it to depart
from him: he came into the world with it, Mat. 7.
he lived in the world with it, and he carried it with him up to the cross, and
dyed with it. He that will go in at a low door, had need to stoop and bow
down him self: if thou do not humble thy self, thou shalt never enter
into heaven.

He that humbles not him self like unto a little child, Mat. 1^.
shall not enter into heaven. Learn of me that am humble of heart, says our
Savior: Mat. 11.
Many are humble in their understanding, but few (...) humble in their will.

Many do know them selves to be frail sinners, but there are few that wold^
be so accounted. But be thou humble of will, and be contented to be as
sclenderly accounted of by other men, as thou know well thy self to be
worthy: and thi^ is to be humble of heart.

Mat. 17.
Jesus Christ our blessed redeemer, di^ show him self in the glory of his
transfiguratio^, but only unto three of his disciples, but the shame of his
reprochefull death he made open to all the world, dying upon a cross
publicly, in the gre^ city of Jerusalem in the time of the solemn feast
of Easter. Most men wold^ have their virtues known to all men, but no man
would have his faults and defect^ made known to any man.

Our Savior did use most of all to preach of humility, because he would have
that lesson to be perfectly learned of (...) all: that blessed doctrine of
humility (...) often repeted and pronounced to the people as a most fruitful
thing, and grea^^ favor does our Lord show always unto those that be humble.
Mat. 8.
The Centurion saying that he was not worthy to have Christ enter into his
house; was preferred before all the Jews. S. Paul that said he was not worthy
to be called the Apostle of Gl^^^^^ was the chief preacher of the Gospel
amongst all the Apostles. 1. Cor. 15
S. Peter (...) ^ought not him self worthy to tarry ^^th Christ, was
appointed by him to be ^ead of his Church. Luc. 5.
S. John Baptist that ^as so full of humility that he thought ^^m self
unworthy to loose the lachet (...) Christ's shoe was made the friend of ^^e
spouse, and he that thought not him ^^lfe worthy to unloose the shoes of our
^^uiour, Luc. 2.
laid after his hands on his ^ead, when he was baptized in the river (...)
Jordan.

God did always from the beginning (...) the world, choose out for him
self, Mat. 3. Io. 1.
^^e least and the simplest in show. Of the ^^st two brothers that were borne
in the ^orlde Cayne, and Abell, Gene. 4.25.41.
he chose Abell ^^at was the younger. Of the children of ^braham he chose
Isaac, that was younger ^^en Ismaell. Of the children of Isaacke, (...) chose
Jacob, that was the younger bro^^er. 2. Re. 16.
And of the twelve sons of Ia^^b, he chose Joseph, one of the youngest (...)
make him prince and ruler of all Egypt. ^mongest the sons of Isay, he chose
^auid, 1. Re. 10.
that was the youngest and the least ^teemed of them all, and made him both
king and a Prophet. He made Saul king ^f Israel being of the least tribe,
and the ^^eanest family of all the Jews.

And when this great lover of humi^^tie came him self into the world, he
those for his companions none of the ^reatest and mightiest princes, but the
^oore and simple fishers. Mat. 4.


Amongst all his unreasonable c^^^^tures, he has planted in the vearie
^^^^nest, and in the least of them all, as (...) Antes, and the Bees, such
knowledge as c^^^seth admiration in man to behold in th^^* And in the creation
of the world, of ^^^teria prima, or the first matter (as the Ph^^losophers do
term it,) which is of lea^^ account, and most vile of all, has he ma^^ all
things. And amongst all his wor^^ wrought for us here on the earth, in (...)
one of them did his humility more gl^^riouslie appear, then in his blessed
dea^^ and passion. Who humbled him se^^ with all obedience to the death of
(...) crose as the Apostle says.

Phil. 2.
So great a friend did our Lord alway^^ show him self unto the simple and mea^^
people, that calling a little child unto hi^ he said, Mat. 19.
Let these little ones come vn^^ me, for unto these perteyneth the king^^dome
of heaven. And afterward blamyng and fynding fault with the pride of
Ca^pernahum, as a thing that so much offe^de^ him, he gave his curse unto it
saying^* VVo be unto thee, Mat. 11.
O thou city of Cape^^nahum, that do exalt thy self up vn^^ the heavens,
thou shall descend dow^ unto the bottom of hell.

The glory of the proud man, do^^ soon turn to confusion, and as pride
(...) hateful to God and man, so is humili^^^ gracious unto all folks. As
ashes do^ keep and preserve the fire, so does hu^^^^^tie preserve the grace of
the holy ^^ost.

Abraham said unto God, shall I speak ^^to my Lord being but dust and
ashes? Gene. 18.
^he deeper that the well is the sweeter is ^^e water thereof, and the more
humble ^^at thou art, the more art thou beloved of ^od. Esteem not of high
estates and dig^^ties in the world, for all these shall ^^ortlie come unto an
end. There be no ^states so great amongst men, but that ^^en are able to
overthrow them again. and all that man sets up, and by labor ^ringeth to
pass, does quickelie pass ^way again, and comes to an end. Con^^der but the
end that proud men do ^ome unto, and thou will have a great de^^re to be
humble.

When corn is cut in the field, all ^yeth a like on the ground together and
^o man can discern which were the highest ^ares, although that in the
growinge, one ^^are did much ouergrowe another: so likewise in the field of
this world although that some be higher then other, and that (...) few do
exceed the residue, in learning, ^onors, wealth, and worldly dignities, yet
when death comes with is hook, and cutteth us all down, and bereueth us of
our lives, then shall we be all equal, and no difference made between one
and another of us.

If thou openest their graves and look in them, thou shalt not be able to
discern who was the rich man, or who (...) poor man, who was in honor, and
who wa^ in none, no difference shall thou find th^^ betwixt a king and a
sheepeheard* neyth^^ shalt thou know who were honora^^^ and much esteemed,
and who were dishonorable and little regarded.

And then (if all the greatness and honors of this world do come to nothing in
the end, but that all estates and conditions of men do conclude a like at the
last) it is mere vanity to desire to be a lofte in this world: have an
humble opinion of thy self, and thou shall find favor at Gods hand, desire
to be low and little in the world, that thou may be exalted and made great
in an other world.

THERE IS NOT AMONGST all the sins which do reign in the world a vice
more hurtful to mankind, then covetousness. The covetous man being cruel to
all sorts of persons, and chiefly to his own body and his soul, and is of
all men hated and abhorred, and does neither enjoy this world, nor the world
to come. CHAP. 36.
THE covetous man shall have no inheritance with Christ: Ephesians. 5.
(says the Apostle.) This is the second battle with which the world does
assault us, and set upon us, which thou ought to encounter and to ^esist
with remembering thy self that thou ^^mest into this world naked, and that all
^^ese temporal riches be but the mucke ^f the earth, and that they must be all
left ^ere in this world behind thee, when thou ^^est out of it.

Amongst all vices there is none so ^^ll of inhumanitie and cruelty as
coue^^usnes is. The covetous man has no cha^^tie in him, he neither knows
father ^or mother, nor brother nor sister, and his nearest kin be all as they
were strau^ge^^ to him. Ecclesiasticus says: He that (...) evil to him
self, Eccl. 14.
unto whom will he (...) good.

No good can be looked for at the c^^uetous man's hand, because he is cr^^^
unto him self, he is good to none, (...) worste to him self: he never does
g^^^ until he dies. He that (...) covetous (...) sparing of his goods, is of
his honor (...) credit over lavish and prodigal: and (...) that makes the
straytest account of (...) money, of truth yet makes he a right ^^^^der
reckening. No sin ought so much (...) be hated, as that cursed vice of
covetousness, which causes that he which is cre^^ted for to love and honor God,
makes (...) self seruante and bondslaue to the (...) riches and mucke of the
earth.

Eccl. 10.
Ecclesiasticus says: There is not (...) worse thing then the covetous man is,
^^^^ther in the earth, in heaven, nor in (...) Other sins although that they
be the^^selues vearie naught yet they be in so^^ sort and degree profitable
unto other But the covetous man is hurtefull and v^^profitable to the common
welthe, for (...) hourding and keeping up still all that (...) gets he
causes a dearth and scars^^^ of things.

None is so poor as he which is c^^uetous, he is cause of his own misery,
(...) greater poverty or misery there can^^^ be, then to have nothing. Unto
the co^^^^^us man all things be wanting, he wan^eth as well that which he
has, as that which he has not. He can not possess that which he has not,
and of that which ^e has he is not master but seruante. unto poverty a few
things do suffice, but ^ouetousnes can not with any thing be sa^isfied. The
greedines of riches, is a disho^orable honor. Other worldly men, ^lthoughe
they enjoy not the next world ^et do they enjoy this world, which is
^resent: But the covetous man, neither en^oyeth this world, nor the next. So as
amongst all worldly folk he is the most mise^able, and unhappy. He that
puts his ^rust in his money, has his mind void of all wisdom. It is a
greater honor, (the^ to win a kingdom,) to conquer a man's own vnordynate
desires. The covetous man has a great conquest to make in subduing his
insatiable love of money.

The Devil when God asked of him whence he came, made answer, Job. 1.
that he had gone round about the earth. So do all covetous me^, they wander
about the earth, as the Devil did, but toward heaven they never look: they
seek not to walk that way: The rich man is a pray for his prince, a mark
for thieves to shoot at, and a cause of quarrel amongst his kynnesfolke and
friends. His own children do desire his death, because they may have the
spoil of him after his death.

He is not worthy of the company of the Angels in heaven, nor meet for the
conversation amongst men here on the earth, he best deserves therefore to
have his habitation in the air amongst the damned spirits, like an other
Judas, that for covetousness of money sold our lord, and hong him self up in
the air when he had done. The covetous man before that he do win any thing
here, he is won him self. And before he can take any thing of any other man,
he is first taken him self by his own vnordynate desires, and his unbridled
appetites. He burns here in the flame of his own desires and shall burn
after in the fiery flame of hell.

L^c. 16.
The covetous rich man that was buried in hell, desired but one drop of water
to cool (...) thirst withal, as though that one drop of water, had been able
to quench all that hot fire. The true signification whereof is, that all the
riches in the world, be but as it were one drop of water in comparison of that
great greedy desire that the covetous man does burn withal. For although
he get that which he desires yet is his burning desire thereby nothing
quenched or abated at all.

Exodus 15.
Every thing that is heavy does naturally incline and draw to his Center.
Nothing does so chardge and burden the heart, as does that foul sin of
covetousness. They descended into hell like heavy stones, says the scripture of
Pharao and his company: Only covetousness ^mongest all other vices is fresh in
a man's ^lde age. If thou do lie upon the earth ^ith thy breast, and drink of
the runninge ^aters of these worldly riches, thou ^halt be discharged from the
service of God. Iu. 7.
As Gedeon for the same cause discharged those out of his service, that went ^o
fight against the Madianites.

This greedy thirst deceyueth many (...) man. Acham was stoned to death for
it. I^s. 7.
G^esie was stricken with leprosy. Judas was hanged: 4. Reg. 5.
Ananias and Saphira died suddenly: and all this was through their covetousness:
beware thou therefore of it. He is rather to be compted a valiant man, Mat. 27.
that conquereth his desires, then he that ouercometh his enemies.

If thou do heap and set riches together, thou make a heap of wood, Act.
5.
with which thy self shall be set a fire, like as the phoenix is. If the
physician forbid the sick man to eat of that which he most earnestly
desires, he will be contented to forbear the same for his healthes sake,
although he can not certeynly tell that he shall recover his health thereby or
no: why will not thou then give credit unto almighty God, which bids thee
to beware of covetousness.

God like a good physician prescribed a diet unto our father Adam, Gene. ^*
but because he would not observe it, nor obey him, he lost much good, and
fell into much evil: Obey God who has care to save thee, and warns thee to
fly away from covetousness.

HE THAT WILL BE Liberal unto our Lord Jesus Christ, in the person of his
poor people, shall alvvayes abound, and no necessary thing shall be vvanting
unto him in this life, and in the next life he shall find, that he has
changed his noughtie money for good. CHAP. 37.
GEVE and you shall have given unto you again: Luc. 6.
says our Lord. Christ compares riches unto thorns, which when they be
laid upon a man's bare hand they will not hurt him, but if he shut his hand
together, they will hurt him and draw blood of him, and the faster that his
hand is shut, so much more is the harm that he shall take thereby. Riches
being in the open hand of the liberal man never does any harm, but
contrariwise, being in the hand of him that shuts his fiste, and will never
open it to the poor and needy, it does much hurt. Happy is he of whom that
may be said which the scripture reports: He opened his hand to the needy,
and to the poor he did not shut his fiste

In gyuing to the poor, Pro. 31.
thou do exchau^ge thy bad money for good: If thou do cut that away from
thee, which thou have more then may suffice thee, thou shall grow and increase
in virtue, like unto the tree that has his superfluous bows and sciences cut
away.

He shall never want, that gives his goods for Gods sake, 3. Reg. 17
no more then the meal, and the oil, were wantinge to the poor wydow that
gave Elias to eat at his need, and relieved him when he was almost dead for
hunger. Many do say, if I might find such a one as Elias was, I cold
willingly bestow mine alms upon him: but such men do much deceive them
selves, for since they will not give unto Elias master, much less will they
give unto Elias, for he that gives unto the poor, does give unto Jesus
Christ, who says him self: That which you have done unto the least of them
that have believed in me, Mat. 25.
you have done unto me also. And if thou will give no succor unto Elias
master, how will thou give it unto Elias.

Happy is he that has consideration upon the poor and needy, Psalm. 40.
for our Lord shall deliver him in the day of danger. In the day of judgment
thou shalt be examined of thy works of mercy.

The poor man God has provided to be the medicine of the rich man: but the
covetous man will none of that medicine to cure his wounds withal. Many do
spend their goods and their wealth in making of fair houses, in buying of
rich tapestrie and Arras clothes, and prouyding them of goodly brave horses for
ostentation sake, and by this means do they think to get them selves fame
and renown. But they are much deceived therein, for if they desire to be
magnified and extolled, men are more likely to spread their fame and glory
abroad, then walls hanginges, or unreasonable beasts which have no tongues
to speak withal. That which thou spendest in setting out of unreasonable
creatures, for to be commended therefore amongst men, give it away to the
poor, and thou shall be both praised therefore, and loved also: For horses and
houses can not set forth thy praise, but poor men may well extol thy name. Be
thou liberal and thou shall be gracious to God, and acceptable amongst men.

The liberal man has many friends, and although there be some which be
vntha^kefull, yet he that gives unto many must needs have many friends? The
covetous man is hated of all men, The poor men do curse him, and his own
adherents do desire his death. And if he have any other vice joined unto his
covetousness, O how much is he maligned and spoken (...) all men? But if the
liberal man be in any blame every man will be glad to cover his fault, and to
reprehend th^^ that do^ find fault with him.

The liberal man does stand in a noble state and condition. And many good
turns does he receive, that is contented him self to do many. He may well be
called a happy man on the earth* And a much happier thing it is to give, then
to take. It is so much better to give, the^ to be given unto, as it is better
to love, the^ to be loved. To love is an action and power of the mind, whence
all virtue flows, but to be loved is no action not commendation of the party
that is beloved. For it happens often, that many be beloved which deserve it
not. God gives unto all folk, and receives again of none, and therefore he
that gives is most like unto god. The son is the most excellent of all the
o^^^r planet^es, because it gives light to all (...)*

He that gives, is liberal, pitiful, and just* and as the covetous man is
vile and niggi^h, so contrarywyse, is the liberal man noble and generous.

Riches to a wise man is a burden and a bondage, and to a fool it is a
reproach and a (...): and although that prodigality be a ^yce, y^^ covetousness
is a worse vice: for the prodigal man does good to many, but ^he covetous
person does good to none.

THE GREATEST MISERIES and calamities that the world has ever received, has
been caused by the abominable vice of lechery and fleshelie lusts, from
which whosoever desires to be kept free, and clean, must fly all occasions
of striuinge therevvithall. CHAP. 38.
DO not you know, (says the Apostle) that your bodies be the temples of the
holy ghost? ^. Cor. 6.
Who soever does violate this temple, God will destroy him. This is the third
battayll, that the world does fight against thee withal.

Other vices do defyle only the soul of man, but this most odious sin,
defyleth the whole man. Thou can not avoid the most rigorous punnishement of
God, if thou will shamefullie defyle the temple of the holy ghost.

For this cursed crime, God destroyed the whole world with the flood, Gene.
17.19.38.34.
he sent down fire from heaven, and consumed therewith five cities: for this
sin was Hemor sodaynlie slain. The city of Sichem was brought to
desolatio^, the whole tribe of ^^^i^myn, was almost all rooted out.

It procured the death of Amon, And it caused Solomon to commit Idolatry. Iu.
20. 2. Re. 13. Tob. 8. Iud. 16. 2. Re. 12.
It was the ^ause of the death of Sarais husbands, and made Sampson blind. It
did great d^mage and harm to king David, and it was the overthrow of the old
judges that accused Susanna, By reason of that, also did God slaye in one day
three and twenty thousand of his own people the Israelites. The greatest and
sharpest corrections that we do read that God has inflicted unto people at
any time, has been for this foul offense of the flesh.

Fly from this pestilence, and the comfort of the holy Ghost will light upon
thee. Have always in thy memory death, Dan. 18. N^m. 28. 1. Cor. 10.
and thou will then keep with gladness that which thou think now to be so
hard and difficult.

Fly from idleness, and thou shall cut of many of thy temptations. Remember
thee of the fire of hell, where fleshly men shall dwell for ever, and thou
shall find all those affections to fail thee, that do now so much torment
thee.

It seemed to thee an hard matter to resist temptation, but an harder matter it
is for thee to be tormented in hell. He that does not defend him self from
the first fire, shall not escape from the second: let one heat put out an
other. Let the remembrance of the hot fire of hell, quench this hot fire of
thy flesh. If the earnest love of God does once take hold of thee, all these
vanities will fly far of from thee. He is the seruante of the devil that
consents unto sin and takes delight in wicked imaginations.

Of this sin spoke the Apostle when he said, Gal. 5.
that they which did such things, should not enter into the kingdom of God.
The sin of the flesh is a fire infernal, and the maynteiner thereof is the
sin of glotony. The flame thereof is filthiness, the Ashes is uncleanness. The
smoke is infamy, the end torment. It is the destruction of the body, The
abridger of thy life, The corruption of virtue, And the transgression of the
law. They that offend God, by delighting in so vile a vice do show the^
selves to be very desperate wretches. If thou will conquer this sin thou
must fly away from it, as the Apostle does give thee council. 1 Cor. 6
This victory is gotten rather by flying, then fightinge.

And if thou will have the fire to aba^e, thou must take away the wood from it,
that is the delicate fare wherewith thou have fostered and fed thy self over
much. For it will be an easy matter for thee to be chaste, if thou will live
with a mean diet, and keep thy self occupied in good exercyses. And great
wonder it were that thou sholdest escape the danger of that fire, if thou
do feed dayntelie and live ydlye.

With the water of thy tears shalt thou best quench the fire of the flesh:
If thou will not fly from the occasion, and remove thy self from the danger
of evil company, either first or last thou must needs be overcome. There be
few, but that either young or old, they do pay some tribute to this idol
of the devil, because there be but few that will firmly resolve with them
selves, to keep them out of danger, and abandon all worldly delights. They
desire to be chaste, and are content to commend it in other, but they will do
but little them selves to the preserving of their chastity: they will be
honest and yet will they not leave of their trade and intercourse with the
world. They have a good meaning, but they have not a provident care. It is
necessary for him that will not fall into this vice, to live very warelie.
And although that thou sholdest be taken amongst worldly men, to be a man of
small good manner, and little nurture, to refuse such company and occasions as
daily thou sholdest be offered, yet thereof take thou no care for so must thou
do, that wilt live in a world so dangerous as this is.

Happy is that chaste soul, which in a clean and pure body, does service
unto her spouse Jesus Christ. Happy is he that prepares in his heart, a clean
hahitation for the holy ghost to dwell in. Happy is he that so cleanses, and
purifieth the temple of the holy ghost, that he makes him therein a meet
habitation.

Remember thy death and what end our bodies must come unto, and into what
corruption they be to be resolved. Reuoluing these things well in thy mind,
thou will be moved to serve God in all cleannes, that so thou may enjoy
him for ever, and so deliver thy self from those infernal fires, where those
men shall be burnte for ever that in this world have followed their appetites
and have gone after their carnal desires.

CHASTITY MAKES A man to be beloved of God, and he has alvvaies had those in
great estimation, which have led a chaste life, which is gotten by chastenyng
of the flesh, and flying from dangerous company. CHAP. 39.
Sap. 1.
INTO a malignant mind, there shall no wisdom enter, neither shall it dwell in a
body that is subject unto sin: says the wise man. Before that God would
declare unto Ezechiell the Prophet, Eze. 24.
what he had in his behalf to show unto the children of Amo^, he first slew
his wife, And when his wife was dead he was better disposed to give care unto
gods secrets, for before he was entangled in the snares of fleshly love.

Amongst the Apostles, S. John the Evangelist, and S. Paul were the only
known virgins: Of which the one was rapt up into the third heaven, and there
saw god him self, and the other had his restinge place in the bosom of our
Lord, where he had his heavenly secrets reveled unto him. And after in the
Isle of Pathmos, Apo. 1.
he reveled unto him also the whole state of the church militant. By this
singular prerogative of their chastity, they were more purified, and had the
more exquisite knowledge of divine things, as appears in the scriptures.

Thomas of Aquine, being endued with this singulier virtue, did shine by his
wonderful wisdom in the Church of God. He that is free from all earthly
cares, may well contemplate the heavenly secrets. Gather thy senses together,
and refrain thy appetites, and so shall thou keep chastity.

Iheremy says, Iher. 9.
Death enters in at our wyndowes. Unless thou set a watch over thy
senses, thy soul is in danger to dye of an evil death.

Isboseth lost his life, 2. Re. 4.
because the doors of his house were not well guarded and kept. If thou take
no care about the keepinge of thy senses, thou shall not be able to keep this
precious treasor. Do but consider what harm has happened to the world by
reason of Eua her over earnest settelinge of her eyes upon the beauty of the
forbidden tree. It is not lawful for thee over curioustie to behold that,
which is not lawful for thee to desire. If David had not so intentiuelie
beholden Bersabe as he did, 2 Re. 11.
he had never lost so much good as he did loose, neither had he fallen into so
much evil, as he fell into. Be thou vigila^t and careful in the keeping of
thy senses: The scripture says, mine eye has taken away my soul. This caused
the death of Holofernes. Iud. 13.


Lay chastity for thy foundation, and thereupon may thou buyld up other
virtues. As among all vices, none so much troubles the understanding, nor
darkeneth reason, as the sin of the flesh does, so likewise by the contrary,
chastity sets man at liberty, and submytteth the sense unto reason. Of God
(that is of his own nature, most pure and clean) the scripture says, that he
feeds among the lillies, because that he takes delight in the cleannes and
brightness of chastity. Every thing delights in his like. The purity that is
in a reasonable creature, is most acceptable to God, wherein as in a thing most
conformable to his own nature, his pleasure is chiefly to rest.

Apo. 21.
It is written. No unclean thing shall enter into the heavenly city. The
spiritual beauty of our soul is principally attributed unto chastity,
because it makes a consonance, and a proportionable agreement betwixt the
soul and the body, by subduinge the flesh unto the soul.

The wise man says, Sap. 4.
O how bewtifull is the chaste generation with cleannes, The memory thereof is
immortal, and it is well known both to God and man. Eccl. 9.
It is likened in scripture unto a rose, as well for the beauty thereof, as
also because it grows and contynueth amongst sharp prickels: for chastity
neither grows nor contynueth, but where there is sharpenes and austeritie of
life, and mortification of the flesh* Chastity is always in danger, being
among pleasures and delights: Chastity dies without it be maynteyned by
fasting and temperance: And being vpholden by these two, it lives and
reigns gloriously, and is crowned at last immortallie. It is as great a
miracle to raise a dead man to life, as it is to be chaste without abstinence.

Thou must not be idle, if thou will have this virtue: Fly from the company
and conversation of all those that be dissolutely disposed, and by this means
preparinge thy body, thou shall make it a meet dwelling, for the holy Ghost.

The Dove flieng out of the Ark of Noah, Gene. 2.
never found where to rest but upon dead bodies, and therefore returned she
back to the Arc again. The spirit of our lord does not inhabit in unclean
bodies, but in those that be pure and chaste. This chastity is a glorious, and
an Angelical virtue. Fly from the pestilence of carnal vices, that thy soul
may be the true and faithful spouse of Jesus Christ.

THOSE THINGS WHICH seem most goodly to the world, being compared with
heavenly things, be as it were nothing, And therefore happy are they that
do consider it, And do despise the world with all the vanities thereof,
and join them selves unto Christ, of whom they may after receive the
reward of eternal life. CHAP. 40.
Psalm. 150.
THEY set nothing by the land that most was to be desired: said the prophet
of worldly men. It is a wonderful matter, that the thing which we most of
all desire, and least make reckenyng of is glory. We do not naturally love
any thing so much, neither do we loose any thing more easelie: but yet for
glory will no man be content to venture the loss of all he has or may have.
And he that seeks ambitiouslie after this worldly glory, does loose in this
life the comfort of the spirit, and in the other, eternal felicity.

The servants of this world, do depryue them selves of much good, and great
consolation. And for the great love they do bear to those corruptible
goods* they never come to taste of the sweet conversation of Jesus Christ. It
is much to be lamented, to see in what things men do receive: their chief
delight, and that they have so corrupted their taste, that the sweet comfortes
of God do grow unto them noisome and unsavory: And the co^templation of God,
and devout praying, do seem unpleasant: And all the bitter and unsavory
pleasures of this world do only seem sweet and pleasant unto them.

The taste of gods love is so delicate and sweet, that they only may taste
thereof, that have no taste in any of the vain pleasures of this world. Fly
away from the vanities of this world, for so much the further as thou go
from them, so much the nearer shall thou come unto God, And be made pertaker of
his heavenly consolations. And the less that thou do converse with the
world so much shall thou enjoy the more of gods love.

If they which do contemn the vanity of this world, and do give them selves
to the service of God, be so filled with so many and so great spiritual
comfortes: why do not thou also make have to go toward him, how long will thou stay? Thy loss and thy ruin, must needs be great, since the love of such
base stuff as this world does yield thee, is able to withholde and keep thee
from him. Let not the bitter pleasures of this life depryue thee of the sweet
and perfect pleasures of the other life. Consume not thy days in the love of
such vile things, and of so little estimation.

Consider with thy self, both what it is that thou loosest, and for what thou
loosest it: that which thou love in this world is nothing, and that which
God has prepared for them that do love him, is infinite, as he him self is
infinite: happy is that soul that is fed only with the love of God, and is
norished with the odor of his holy virtues.

Happy is he whose determination is fully set to get the invisible things,
and to despise these visible things. It is most clear that such a one, is
both a good and a wise man, for he buyeth for small things, things without
measure, and for things transitory, things that be everlasting: and for vile
things and of no price, things that be of infinite value: he buyeth fair
things for soul, pleasante things, for things most miserable, sweet
things for bitter, and that which is most of all, he bu^eth all things for
nothing. If thou will, come unto him, thou must love him alone for thou can
not love him perfectly as thou ought to do, if thou do love anything
beside him or with him.

Let not the appearance of these corruptible things deceive thee: let not the
vanity of these honors, nor the pleasures of this present life blind thine
understanding: In despysing of the vanity of this world, thou shalt win
the love of God. Consider how little God does command thee, and how much he
does promise thee. Resign up the vile things of this world, that thou may
get the most precious pearl of infinite value, which is the life everlasting,
for this present life is in effect but a moment in comparison of that
perpetual life which is to come. Despise this short and corruptible life, that
^hou may win the eternal and happy life.

He were to be accounted but for a fool, that having goodly Palaces, and
fair cities of his own, would go dwell in a sta^le: Such is this miserable
world in respect of the celestial city. Make then but little account of that
which appears somewhat* and is in deed little or nothing at all. And look
unto our Lord, who is he that does inuit thee with his holy love, and does
set open unto thee the gates of heaven. Cut away the root of evil thoughts
which the devil and the world have planted in thy fantasy.

Enforce thy spirit to despise the^^ corruptible and transitory things, and
to lo^^e the durable and eternal things for the which thou wast made, To the
intent that thou may live here in this life, ^s in the w^y, and in the next
thou may reign as in thy proper Country. Amen.

The end of the second book.
THE THIRD BOOK of despisinge the world. Which teaches how by despisinge
these vanities we may serve Jesus Christ. The third part.
All things of this world be false and vain, and therefore they can not
satiate our souls, but God only, who is our chief good of all, does
perfectly satiate and fall all those that do feed (...) ^ym. CHAP. 1.
THE rich men (says the psalm) were hungry and suffered necessity, Psalm. 33
but to the^ that do seek God al goodness shall abound. He that has God has
all goodness, and every thing shall abound unto him: and he* that has not God
has nothing: without God every delectation is sorow^ull* every joy is vain,
and all abundance is poverty and necessity: it is great liberty of soul
not to desire any thing in this world.

God only* who has created ou^ soul, does fulfill our desires, and satisfy
our appetites they be very vain that do think to find true contentment in
things of this life.

There is nothing so sweet in this life, but that it is full of bitterness:
there is nothing so precious, so good, or so delectable, that can make a man
thoroughly happy, either by delyuering him from evil, or by gyuing him joy
everlasting, but only God, who is our chief good, and our felicity: what so
ever is not of God is poverty.

God shall feed me, and nothing shall be wanting unto me: Psalm. 22.
says the prophet. The kings and princes of the earth can not say so much,
for the greater that they be, so much the more do they suffer necessity: they
have greater care to maintain their honor, and to provide for their house, and
to govern that, which is under their charge. Only the servant of Jesus Christ
can say, that nothing shall be wanting unto him: he that is fed at Gods hand
is sure to be satiate and contented.

The world does feed his sheep with withered grass, and keeps them
amongst the briers and thorns, their water is poisoned, and under the grass
does death lie lurking. Gene. ^.
The devil gave meat to our first forefathers, and after they had eaten they
were poisoned. The worldly man does eat the herbs of deli^^^, and suddenly
after he has eaten die(...) withal. He is trained with the (...)* of honors
and ^iches, and is after taken and caught fa^^ by them.

The ^oly Prophet: Psa. 141.
says thou art my God, (...) art my portion in the land of the living.
Happy is he that is fed at (...) own hand: and puts not his (...) in men.
Happy is he that seeks God ^ith his whole heart, and desires to be comforted
by him.

Drink thou never so much of the (...) of these worldly honors and vanitie^*
(...) thy thurst shall never be quenched, burt^^^ shall still be like to one
that is in a dropsy, who the more that he drinks, the more he may still
drink. All things d^^trust in our Lord, Psa. 103.
and he gives them meat in their due time.

The prodigal son after he had o^^ separated him self from God, L^^. 15.
confessed straight ways that he was almost dead for hunger. Vice does always
cause family and much trouble in the will of (...) which virtue does not, but
does still minister unto it much joy and comfort. The wise man says, Prou. 23.
do not thou taste of the pleasant dishes that the world sets bes^ thee,
for his bred is full of lyinge and falsehood. Although it tells thee, that
thou shall find in vice and in sins good nourishement and satietie, yet do
not thou believe it.

The Nigremanciers and inchaunters will make a show to thine eye of pleasant
Gardens and fruytfull trees, but if thou do gather (...) of the frayte
thereof thou shall fyn(...)ge at all therein: so does the world (...) men
believe that whatsoever it offers unto them, is of good substance, and may
well suffice to satisfy their hunger, but in truth when trial is made there
is nothing found, but that which is vain and full of wind. And this is the
cause why they are never satisfied, nor do live contented.

Our soul is no Camelion, that it can live by wind alone. David says in the
person of the world, Psa. 118.
I opened my mouth, and drew in the air. The world opens his delights, and
lays abroad his will and pleasure, and thinks to feed men with wind.

Ose. 12.
Ephraim (says Osee) feeds the wind. A very vain thing is that which
fills not the place where it is. The things of this world do not fill our
soul, but only puff it up and make it swell. VVoldest not thou take him for
a fool, that when he were hungrye would open his mouth and take in the air to
satisfy his hunger withal? The folly is nothing less if thou think to
satisfy thine appetite with the wind of this worldly vanity.

Psalm. 16.
The Prophet said unto God of w^^rldlie men, their belly is filled with those
things which thou keep most secret. Lords and great men use to set out the
best things in their house to the most (...) of the eye. They hang up their
hanginges of silk and Arras in their (...) and cheifest chambers of resort,
(...) the most base and vile things of their (...) they bestow in the corners
and (...) of the house: Even so does (...) the riches of his glory, and of his
(...) the open market, affordinge (...) pennyworth thereof, to as many as (...)
buy of yt. But the gold and silver (...) worthy to be esteemed, and (...)
the very sweeping and (...) house, he has hid under the (...), and set them
out of sight. Of (...) secret things then, which in gods (...) naught worth,
nor reputed for (...) David says) The belly of these ^^^^dlie men is full,
They fill them selves with air, and gather together the most vile things of
gods house, to make their ^^^^sor of.

These worldly things be like unto a sharp liquore, which never satisfies,
(...) provoke the appetite to take more (...) they shall suffer hunger like
dogs and shall go round about the city says the Prophet David. Psa. 58.
They go round about the earth to get honors and riches, but for all that
their hunger will not be satisfied. The Prophet Aggeus says unto worldly men.
Thou have eaten but thou have not satisfied thy self, Agge. 1.
and thou have put on thy clothes and art never the warme^.

The more worldly things that thou have, the more shall thou desire of them,
and the vehemency of thy thirst shall be the greater. Thou art like one that
eats sal^^ And as he that throws oil into the (...) to quench it. Labor
not to seek (...) the vanities of this world, for thou shall never quench
therewith the thyrst of th^^ soul although thou gettest that whi^^^ thou do
desire.

THE SOVLE BEING endued with reason, and created after the image of God,
ought to delighte and rejoice only in him, and of him receive perfect
comfort. CHAP. 2.
OPEN thy mouth and I will fill it (says God. Psa. 18.
) After that our Lord had recommended unto his people the observing of his
commandments. In reward thereof he told them, that if they would open their
mouths, he would fill them. Thou must not understand this by our bodily mouth,
which being of so small a quantity, is soon filled, but of the mouth of the
soul which as our desire and our longinge.

The whole world is not able to satisfy the great desire of our soul, but
only God which created our soul after his own Image and likeness, who is he
that said: Put forth thy petition and extend thy desire, for I am he that must
satisfy and fulfill it, and none other beside me.

The reasonable soul which is created after the image and likeness of God, may
well be occupied about many things, but it shall never be satisfied nor
filled, but with God him self. In him it is at rest and quyetnes, and by him
it receives perfect joy, and felicity. Happy is that soul unto the which
God is all things, and nothing is pleasant unto yt but God alone, and beside
him all things are bitter and grievous. Our soul shall never find rest, if
it seek for comfort in earthly things.

The vessel whilst it is in the water seems not heavy, but as soon as it
comes out of the water, the heaviness and weight thereof appears. The reason
is, because the substance thereof being earth or that which is nearest unto
earth: it has most agreement and co^uenience with the element of water, when
it is upon the water. So when thou art with God in heart by faithful love, thou
art in the element that is most proper, and proportionate unto thee, and
remaining there with him, thou go away merely and with good contentment.
But when thou do love the world, thou go clean out of thine own proper
element which is God, and therefore every thing then seems paynefull and
heavy unto thee.

The wicked men find much trouble and business even in the midst of their
honors, and good men find comfort and quyetnes in all reproaches that can be
given the^. Only in God is true joy of heart. And out of God is there neither
peace nor pleasure. As thy body can never take rest being laid upon a narrow
piece of wood, so shall thy soul never find any rest in things of this
world. All that (which is not God him self) does no more good unto the soul:
then it does ease to the body to sleep upon a boorde that is not three
fingers broad. Thou ought to consider, that thou can g^t no rest by loving
the things of the earth, and for that cause thou ought to turn thee unto
God alone, if thou will get a quiet life.

When God created man, the scripture says that he rested him: ^ene. 1.
which he said not when he had created other things, for man can only rest in
God. God is said to rest in man only, when man receives his only rest in God
him self.

^sa. 102.
God fills thy desire with good things, says the prophet. Our appetite will
never rest until it come unto the end it seeks. Our soul is of that noble
nature, that nothing can satisfy it, but the chief good of all which is god.
Which appeared by the earnest crying out of David saying: Psalm. 41.
As the heart desires the fountain of water, so longs my soul after thee (O
my God) my soul has thirsted after thee, the fou^tayne of lyuelie water: when
shall I come, and appear before thy presence? My tears were my food both day
and night, when they asked of me where is now thy God? When he was from god,
he wept to see him self in that thirst, and in that necessity: And therefore
he desired god to give him his full and perfect contentation.

The world cannot quench the thirst of thy desire, therefore ought thou to
go unto Christ who says, whosoever thirsts, le^ him come unto me. Set not
thine heart upon the vanities of this present world, unless thou do mean
to be vexed with unquietness and affliction. Do not thou love this temporal
glory, and thou shall have the eternal glory.

If thou do look to obtain whatsoever thou desire, take the counsel of
that holy Prophet David that says, Psalm. 36.
Delight in our Lord, and he will give thee the petitions of thine heart. Him
only ought thou to love, and so in this life thou shall be glad and
rejoice, and in the other live in bliss everlasting.

GOD IS ONLY THE FOOD of our soul, for he has made us only for him self:
and our soul being a spirit, it is impossible to satiate it with corporal
things, because there is no conformity betwixt them and it. CHAP. 3.
I SHALL then be satisfied when I shall see thy glory, Psalm. 16.
(says the Prophet unto God) do not thou seek for contentement in things
that be created, for in them shall thou never find it. All that is in the
whole world, is but little for our reasonable soul. That vessel which is
able to conteyne God him self, can never be full, until that God him self
do fill it. The cause whereof is the vanity of these worldly things.

The things that be of their own nature vain, (as all these worldly things
be) do so occupy the place wherein they be, that for all their being there,
the place remains empty still, and gold does no more satisfy the soul,
then wind does satisfy the body. The desires of our soul can be but little
satisfied, with all that is on the earth to be desired, because the desires
thereof be infinite, and without the compass of any measure or bounds.
Therefore in this life we have no other remedy, but to take away the desire
of the things of this world.

If a man were so mad, that he would needs fly up into heaven, it were but
an evil remedy to devise for him all such things, as were necessary to
further his enterprice forward. It were much better to consider the means how
to make him leave it of, and to put that imagination out of his head, since it
is a thing impossible to be brought to pass. After this manner must thou
apply the remedy to all thy greedy desires, and thirsting after honors and
riches, always persuading thy self, that it is impossible for thy soul to be
satiate with any thing that is contained under thee cope of heaven. This is
all the remedy that thou have to take away these vain desires of thine, for
it is more easy for a man to have wings, and to fly above the clouds, then
to have thy desires fully satisfied with the pleasures of this life.

These temporal goods, be but as an (...) matter, to set our desires on a
fire. As it were a madness to add more wood to the ^^re for to put it out
withal, so is it as great madness for us to think, that we can put out the
fire of our desires, with the dry wood of these worldly delytes. The
principal cause and reason thereof is because that none of the goods of this
life, can have any conformity or agreement with the nature of our soul.

God has made us for him self, and our heart is never settled in full
quyetnes, until that it rest wholly in him. God has given unto all things
certain prescribed rules, answerable unto their own natures. It were against
all rule of reason to feed an horse with flesh, and a lion with grass,
because it is not agreeable with their natures. And our soul being a spirit,
how shall it be satisfied with corporal things? Gold and our spirit be
nothing like together, neither any thing that the world brings forth or
gives, has conformity with the nature of the soul. Unto some creatures as
unto the Camelions, it gives air to mainteyne them withal, wherewith the
proud men do seem to be maynteined also, but yet the soul is no Camelion.

Unto some other it gives Iron to live withal, as the Oysteriges, unto which
it seems that covetous men have some conformity. Some be fed with filthiness,
as the fleshly and carnal folk, and to some it gives poison for their
food, as unto the envious persons. But because all these things be earthly
and have no agreement with our soul, it can not b^^ sustained with earthly
things: only grace and the gifts of the holy Ghost (as things spiritual)
can give sustenance and strength to our soul. And although that pride, and
envy, and all other vices, be things in their kind spiritual, yet follows
it not thereon that they be the food of our spirit, for their be many
corporal things which be not the sustenance or food of our bodies. The
reason is, for that God is only the food of our soul, and not any other
thing in the world beside. He having so ordained it in our creation, that our
soul should not be satisfied with any thing but him self.

If thou should curiously ask why bread does nourish our bodies and not
poison, there is no other reason to be given thee therefore, but that bread is
agreeable to the nature of the body and not poison: And even so is it by our
soul, for as much as God is the natural food thereof: if it be fedd or
nourished with any other thing but God, it is enough to make it to starve for
hunger.

This spiritual food has also this advantage, which our bodily nourishment
has not, for that our bodily sustenance engenders still a satietie and
loathing in them that do take of it, but the soul enjoying once heaven, and
having the fruition of God, may both have satietie without lothsomnes, and yet
have withal an hunger unto God, so as the satietie or fullnes quenches not
the desire, neither lets the soul from desiring still.

Make not much a do in afflicting of thy self, to win authority or credit
in the world, for all is but affliction and torment of the spirit: seek not
after the riches and honors of this miserable world, for in them shalt thou
find nothing but charge and care, but turn thy self wholly unto God, for he
is thy true food, and sustenance of thy soul, that maynteyneth it, and
enricheth it.

WHOSOEVER DESIRES to find rest let him not seek it in things of this
world, for they be all full of trouble and turmoyle, but let him turn him
unto God, and he shall enjoy quyetnes, and most happy tranquillity. CHAP. 4.
RETVRNE (O my soul) unto thy rest: ^sa 1^4.
(says the prophet) The sick man although he do change his beds never so
often, yet shall he never find ease, until his pain be taken away, that
caused his unquietness. Thou do carry about with thee the infirm^tie of
worldly love, but until thou cast it clean away from thee, thou shalt never
find any ease in all the delicate beds of honors, riches, or delights. In
God only thou shalt find rest: love God and thou shalt find quietness,
turn thee unto him and thou shall enjoy a most perfect contentment.

Jonas the prophet, after he was gone away from God never found rest, Ion. 1.2.
he was disquieted upon every place on the land, he fled after to the sea, and
being in a ship the tempest ouertooke him and disquyeted him, but where God is,
there is no tempest: he called unto God in the whales belly, and made his
prayers unto him, and so when he turned unto him he was discharged of all his
former troubles.

Seek not for any rest in things of this life, think not to find any
perfect joy in this world, for where so ever thou becomest, thou shall be
beaten with many afflictions: thou cariest thy infirmity with thee, thou
shalt not find quyetnes in any thing that thou love here: change not thy
place but change thine affection: turn unto God and thou shalt be in rest
and quyetnes: this is the readiest way to find that comfort which thy soul
seeks after.

When temporal goods be once gotten, they be but little esteemed: but
things eternal which be gotten with less travail then the other, be much
esteemed, because they give perfect contentment.

All the time that Jacob continued in Labans house, Gene. 32.
he never had any thing but displeasures and disquyetnes, but as soon as he
was gone from him, he met straight way with an whole host of angels. They
which do serve the world, never find out any thing but trouble and travail
as Jacob did when he served Laban: therefore the servant of Jesus Christ ought
to turn toward his fathers house, which is God him self, and there shall he
find divine consolations: as in all mischeefes, the remedy that we have, is
to go out of them, the same way that we came into the so the remedy to make
us perfect, is to return thither, from whence we were departed: and it is
natural for every thing to return unto that from whence it first came, and
in this consists our perfection.

The bull when he is well bayted in the market place, goes over out again at
the same door that he came in at, for natural instincte did teach him to seek
to avoid danger the same way he entered into it: and thou when thou art well
bayted and hunted up and down here in the world, endeavor thou to go out
again the very same way that thou came in, for it is the only remedy to
get perfection of bliss, to enter thither again from whence we first
departed.

God being then the only beginning from whence all our good proceeds: since
every good and perfect gift proceeds from above: as S James says. Iac. 1.
If thou will find rest, and true joy, it is necessary for thee to turn
thee unto god. Nothing does at any time receive the perfection of his own
nature, unless it be reduced to the general original of the same. And
because that God is the general original from whence all our good proceeds,
therefore desires our soul so earnestly after god, because that getting once
him, he gets all that is good, for all that is good, either it is God him
self, or else it comes from God.

When a great worldly Prince goes ^o make his abidinge in a country that is
^ut barrayne and poor, yet all manner of victuals be found there abundantly,
and when he departs thence again, it shall remain barrayne and poor, as it
was before. So when God abides in our soul, every good thing is there
abundantly, and when he departs thence again, it ^axeth all barrayne and
dry. With gods presence all good things do come to ^hee, and in him shall
thou find rest, and ^ut of him, there is nothing but trouble and disquietnes.

The Egyptians had among them for ^ne of their plagues, Exodus 8.
the busy unquiet ^i^s, which be the troublesome cares of ^he mind, but
Israel which is the true people of God, had the sweet Sabbath of ^est and
pleasure.

It is a great torment to burn in the desire of earthly things: and greet
comfort it is, not to have any longinge after any thing in this world. He
only th^^ has his sure hold fast upon god almighty is merry and joyful,
whilst other live i^ in torment and heaviness.

THERE IS NO TRUST TO be had in things of this world, f^^ at our most need,
they be gone avv^^ from us, only God is to be loved: a^^ in him is our trust
to be placed, for ^^ never forsakes them that trust in him but is alvvayes a
ready help for th^^ in all their afflictions. CHAP. 5.
TRUST in God, and do w^^ (says the Prophet. Psalm. 36.
) A^^ things that be created, d^^ fail us at our most need^^ and for that
cause it is va^itie to put any trust in them* If thou do trust in men thou
shall often be deceived. After good service, th^^ give but sclender rewards:
if thou do e^trust in them thou shall find discomfor^^ thereby, for it is
written, cursed is he th^^ puts his trust in man. Iher. 17


Trust not in princes, Psa. 117. Hest. 7
nor in the sons of men, in which there is no salvation, says David the
Prophet. Amon did put great ^onfidence in the favor that he found ^t king
Assuerus hand, but at last he came ^hereby unto a miserable end. They that ^yue
in most favor of the world, they commonly loose all their favor again at the
^^st, and they which were most beloved, ^ecame to be after as much hated,
accor^ing to the common course of the world. ^he world does always turn
about, and ^^oughe a man were so fortunate to con^^nue all his life in good
grace and favor, that good will* that do him, when death ^^meth and catches
him. Think not ^^ou to have any sure stay in a staff that made of reed, 1.
Re. 18.
and no better trust is there (...) be had in any mortal man.

In the psalm it is written: happy is (...) that puts his trust in our
Lord: Psa. 38. Prou. 10.
hap^^e is he that loves God with his whole ^^rt, and puts his trust in
him, for he ^^il deliver him in the time of his distress. ^^t because that
true hope is founded ^^on a good conscience the Prophet says. ^^at he should
not only trust in God, but ^^so do well.

The hope of the wicked (says the ^yse man) shall perish, Prou. 16.
because it is not ^^unded upon good works. They live ^^delie, and yet hope
that God will give ^^em glory. If thou hopest that God will ^^ue thee his
bliss, when thou daily offendest him, it is rather rash presumption i^ thee,
then any well ordered hope. Trus^ thou in God, for in fulfillinge on thy part
that which longs unto thee, God of h^^ infinite mercy, will not fail to
give the^ glory, since he never forsakes them th^^ do put their trust in him.

Solomon says of a diligent Christian thus: Pro. 31.
He puts his hands unto strong^ labors, and his fingers have not refused
the spindell. Upon the distaffe does remay^^ that which is to be sponne, and
that which is already sponne, is upon the spind^^ and so that which we have
labored for and travailed to get, is now upon the spi^^dle, and that which
hangs still on the distaffe, remains yet to be wrought an^ labored. He
sets his fingers to the spi^^dle, that trusts in God upon that which he
has done already, and he takes the distafe in hand, that is in good hope
upon that which is yet to be done.

It is a very vain thing for thee (...) lead an evil life, and then to
trust upon penance to be made after at leisure, w^^^ thou know not surely
whether th^^ shalt live until to morrow. These ha^^ in their hands their
distafes, where^^ hangs that which they have to work^ which they never go
about to make a^ end of.

Thou ought by and by to reform^^ thy life, and to have good hope that Go^
will give thee of his glory, since it is (...) sure, that he never denies it
to any which do that which he commands. So in fulfilling of the
commau^dements of God, ^hou may make full account that he will give him
self unto thee, to the end that by thine enjoying of him, thou may ^lwayes
be happy. Ose, 12.
Trust always in God says the scripture) and he will deliver ^hee from all
thy temptations: saying by ^he mouth of Salomo^. Pro. 3.
That he is the shild ^f them that put their trust in him. David ^ut his trust
in God, and he was helped.

Happy is he that puts his trust in God, Psalm. 2.
and fears nothing the malice of men. Eccl. 1.
Happy is he that had no fear in his mind, neither fell from his hope at
all. Happy is he whose strength is God him self, for in the time of
tribulation, Isa. 25.
his ^ope shall not be vain. Eccl. 2.
Ecclesiasticus ^aith, consider o ye mortal men, and know (...) for certain,
that never any trusted in ^ur Lord and was confounded, nor perseuered in his
commandments and was forsaken.

The sick man has good cause to trust ^n that Physician for his health, that
cures ^ll disseases: Psa. 145.144.
Our Lord (says the Prophet) is he which heals all thy sickness, and saves
thy life from death. He is near unto all those that call upon him.

AS GOD DOES IN Goodness exceed all other things, so ought man to love him
incomparably about all other things, which if they have any jot of goodness
in them, they have it by participation of some piece of gods infinite goodness.
CHAP. 6.
Luc. 10.
THOU shall love God, with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy
force, (says our Lord) for it suffices not to tell thee only of the
dangerous way of the world which thou must forsake, but also to instruct thee
withal of the good way that thou have to follow in hating the vanities of this
world.

Place thy love in God only: with out loving thou can not live. And seeing
then, that thou must needs love, bestow thy love there where thou may
find most sweetness and delighte. Thou ought not to commyt so great an
offense against the high majesty of God, as to cople together his divine love,
with the love of these most base and beggarly things of the world.

As God does infinitely exceed all (...) creatures, so ought our love to him
^^comparablie exceed the love of all ^^her things. Who ought to gather the
^^^te, but he that planted the tree? says ^^e Apostle. Who planteth a Vine,
1. Cor 9.
and ^^th not of the fruit thereof? And ^^om ought thou to love, but him
that ^^de thee able to love? In him alone ^^ghtest thou to put thy love, of
whom ^^ou receyuedst thy power to love. Fly ^^e corruption of the world, make
not thy ^^rt thrawle to the vanity thereof. Take ^^e love of God for thy
refuge and defense. Gene. 19.


This is the very mountain that God ^^d Lot to save him self a^, unless he
^^^d be burned up, with the fire of So^^me. So thou (O Christian soul) fly
^^om the maledictio^ of this world, unless ^^ou wilt be burned up in the flame
of ^orldlie passions.

Nothing will so easelie make thee (...) despise the vanity of the world, as
the ^^ne of God. And because thy heart was ^uer thoroughly towched with the
fire of ^^ds love, thereof grows it, that thou art ^llen so in love, and have
so great a savor (...) the corruptible goods of this vn^^ppie world. All the
troubles and cares ^^at thou art vexed with, proceed here^^, that thou love
not God, as thou ^ughtest to do.

O that thou might but taste a little of ^^e sweetenes of gods spirit. O
how easelie would thou then despise that which thou now set so much by?
Thou sho^^^dest not then have so many cares, for vn^^ the seruante of God one
care is sufficie^^

The nature and property of lo^^ is, to have no care about any thing (...)
that which he loves. That is well ^^^fied here in this worldly love, where
(...) shall often see that some one man for (...) obteynynge of that thing
which he ^^^nestlie loves, makes no reckenynge (...) either goods, honor, or
fame, and of^^^tymes hasardeth his life therefore (...)* He puts all things
in adventure to ha^^ his will. He forgets him self, and eue^ other thing,
for that which he deare^^ loves. Now if this fond love of things so little
worth the louinge, be of su^^ force, that it takes from a man the lou^^ the
care of every other thing, how mu^^ more should the love of God, make him (...)
be free from all other care, either of hy^ self, or any thing else.

These superfluous cares which tho^ take, and the much caring for thy self
makes it to appear plain, that tho^ love not God at all. For if thou
didde^^ love God, the only care that thou sholde^^ have about the serving of
him, wolde^^ occupy thee, that thou sholdest have (...) time left, to bestow
in loving any thing beside him.

After this manner did the old father in time past, transfourme them selue^
unto God, that they forget them selves, and ^ll other worldly things, so as
they were ^eputed of worldly men to be no better ^hen careless Idiotes utterly
void of reason and sense.

Let it be thy principal exercise to ^ake thine account with God, and with
thine own soul, so as if there were ^ot any other thing in the world for
thee ^o do besides. Thou ought to love God so, as if it might be possible
thou ^oldest forget thy self, in such sort, as ^^at thou might truly say
as the Apo^^le did. I live not, Gal. 2.
but Jesus Christ lives (...) me.

Love not the things of this world ^o, as to make them the end of thy love,
^ynce all that thou can love in this world ^hou shall find to be much more
per^ectlie in God, then in the world. If thou ^oest love any thing because it
is bewti^ull: why do not thou love God, who is ^he fountain of all beauty?
And if good^es be the thing that our will is fixed on, who is better then God?
Luc 18.
There is none good but God alone, in his own nature and substance.

The goodness of a creature, is so far forth good, as it does participate with
some drop of that great Sea of gods infinite goodness. Now if thou do so
much love any creature, for some show of goodness that thou perceyuest therein,
although there be in deed infinite imperfections in it, why do not thou
love God who is essentiallie good of him self, and the perfection of all
goodness?

The less material substance that there is in bodies, so much lighter they
be, and so much the better disposed to ascend upward. Therefore if our souls
be laden with the love of earthly things, they shall the less be able to
ascend up by charity to God. There is perfect love, where there is no
disordinate passion, and he that does perfectly love God, will nothing esteem
the vanities of the earth.

THE LOVE OF THY Neighbor is so joined unto the love of God, that it is
impossible for thee to love the one, and to hate the other, And therefore it is
a most sure thing, that he which loves not his neighbor, is condemned to
perpetual pain of hell. CHAP. 7.
Mar. 12.
THOU shall love thy neighbor as thy self (says god) The honest love of thy
neighbor is so joined unto the love of God, that with the vearie same love
that thou love God, thou may love thy neighbor also. They proceed both
out of one root, and the love of God and of our neighbor, be inseparable:
with the same habitual charity, that thou love God, thou love thy
neighbor.

The Apostle says: Romans 13.
he that loves his neighbor fulfilleth the law. Thou can not divide thy
self from thy neighbor, but that thou must withal divide thy self from God
also. All the lines that be made from the uttermost part of a circle unto the
Center, which is the middle point, must needs join together in the Center.
And the further that any of those lines is drawn from the Center, the further
does it go from the other lines, and the further that one line is drawn from
an other, the further does it go from the Center.

Thou can not by any means separate thy self from thy neighbor, either by
loving of him little, or by hating of him, but that thou must separate thy
self ^lso from God: thou must needs feel somewhat of thy neighbors harms,
and ^eare a part with him in all his afflictions. Job never tare his garments,
Job. 1.
nor gave any signification of sorrow, for the loss of his goods and
substance, but only when word was brought him of the death of his children.
But many feel more grief of the loss of their temporal substance, ^hen of
any harm that happens to any of their neighbors, were it never so great.

Let it not grieve thee, to loose these corruptible goods, which God does
suffer often to be taken from thee, for thine own greater good and benefit,
but let thy neighbors harms, pearce thine heart, and let his hurt be thine.

When God created the world, of all such things as he made therein, he
created of every sort of the things that he made, many, as trees, plants,
beasts, and all other living creatures, which should multiply and increase
every one of them in their kinds, yet made he but one man, and one woman, of
which all the rest of the men in the world should descend, to the end that when
they should see how that they were all descended from one, they might be
provoked thereby one to love another with more earnest affection and good will.

God praised the first day that he created, and all that he made in it, but not
the second day, unto the which he gave no praise at al, neither called he it
good, as he did all the other beside that. The cause whereof was, for that it
was the first day that did separate and deuyde it self from the unity, which
separation God abhors, and therefore had that day, amongst all the residue
no praise at all.

Make thou no parts, nor divisions, lest thou be greeuouslie punnished
therefore at gods hand, let it not seem any hard thing unto thee, to love
thy neighbor, for although to some folks at some times it seems so, yet if
thou consider it well, it had been a much more hard precept for thee to have
kept, if God should have commanded thee to hate him. For to love, does agree
with our nature, but to hate is clean contrary unto it.

God commands us always such things as our natures be most prone unto, and
as much against the nature of man it is for to hate one another, as it is
against the nature of water to ascend upward. And albeit that by the means of
thy corrupted mind, it might seem unto thee some pleasure for to hate thy
neighbor, yet can it not seem any pleasure to thee at all to burn therefore
for ever in hell fire. Choose therefore which of the two thou likest best, for
if thou hate thy neighbor, thou shall surely therefore be condemned to hell
fire.

Unhappy is he, that had rather burn, then love, for if he had loved
charitablie his neighbor, he had not been burned in hell at all. An evil
choice make thou, if thou had rather be damned, then love thy neighbor.
Remember that to love thy neighbor, is commanded thee by God him self, and
it is also conformable to reason, and to the law of nature.

Love thou therefore thy neighbor, although he love not thee, but persecute
thee, and then shall thou be the vearie child of God. Mat. 5. Romans 8.
And if that thou be his child, thou shall be also fellow heir with him of the
celestial kingdom, where thou shall rest in peace with him for ever.

FOR THE RARE AND great spiritual profittes, that are gotten by louinge of
our enemies, every good christian ought with all his heart to love them,
especially for that it is the proper quality of Christian perfection. CHAP. 8.
LOVE your enemies, and do well to them that hate you (says our lord) that
you may be the very children of your father which is in heaven. Mat. 5.
The children of Princes and great me^, are always brought up under masters
which may teach them, and reprehend such faults as they find in them. There is
no better Scholemaister then an enemy, which gives diligent attendance upon
thee, and observes thy life, and as soon as he can find any fault in thee,
thou shall be sure to hear of yt.

If thou will be vigilant about thy life, pray unto god to give thee some
enemy, for that will make thee best to look about thee, and to have due
regard to thy life and conversation, And if thou do get such a one, what
have thou else of him but a master that will well look unto thee, and have
diligent watch over thee, to whom thou shall need to give no fee in
recompense of his pains and trauayll had about thee. Other men seek them out
masters with care, and some expense withal, and yet have much a do to find
them out, and thou have gotten thee one, without any trouble at all, which
shall cost thee never a penny.

And if thou will be the child of the king of glory, it behooves that thou be
brought up under some good master, who may teach thee to live well, and to
have care over thy self. Before thine enemy thou will take good heed what
thou say, for thou know well if thou do commyt any error, he will
murmr against thee for yt, thou will also beware how thou live, for if thou
do any evil, thou shall be sure to have it soon published abroad. If thou
go but a little out of the way, thou shall be quickelie reprehe^ded for yt.
All these good turns do thou get at thine enemies hand.

When thou live amongst thy fre^des, thou art bold to speak, and to do
at thy pleasure what thou think best whereby thou do often offend god,
and take much occasion of sinful living, but when thou art before thine
enemies, thou will take good heed, both what thou speak, and what thou
do, lest thou be reprehended therefore to thy shame. Thy friends be a cover
to thy sin, and thine enemies be a bridle to thy vices: with thy friend thou
offendest God, and with thine enemy, thou do that which thou ought to
do. Thine enemy is as it were a clock for thee to set thy life in an order
by. Thou receyuest better turns at thine enemies hand, then thou do at thy
fre^ndes. It is reason the^, that thou sholdest love him, and honor him, that
does thee so many benefits. He makes thee virtuous, wise, discreet, and
wary: Now if the law of nature byndeth thee to love him that does thee good,
it is reason also, that thou sholdest love thine enemy, and be kind unto him.

If thou do set by and esteem a little stafe or a wande, for that it serves
thee to beat of the duste from thy garments: why will not thou esteem of
thine enemies and set much by them, that do wype away the dust of thy
defectes, by reprehending thy faults? Assure is the staff of my fury: Es. 10.
says God by the mouth of the prophet Isay.

God used Assure that was enemy to the Israelites, as a staff to beat his
people withal, that by the persecution of their enemies, they might be both
cleansed and sanctified. Thou must neither mar nor burn this staff in the
fire. Thou must not more esteem thy goods, then thy soul.

When our friends do extol us and magnify us, our enemies do humble us,
and keep us under, that we wax not ^roude and insolent. When our friends ^^y
to much making of us, do make us ^linde, our enemies by persecutinge us ^oe
make us to receive our sight again. Our enemies are to be esteemed and loved
of us, for if they were not, we should be much worse then we be: and for the
pre^eruation of virtue, it is needful either ^o have a true friend or a
sharp enemy.

Our enemies will tell us true, when our friends dare not: for many will not
receive admonition at their friends hands, and therefore God sends us enemies,
because they may tell us that which our friends dare not: And as much good as
^hyne enemy does unto thee, so much harm does he unto him self: for he
kills his own soul, and perishes his conscience: wher^fore when thou see
him in so evil plighte, that did thee so much good, thou ought to take
pity on him.

The prophet David says: They have persecuted him, Psalm. 68.
whom thou haste persecuted, and they have added sorrow unto his wounds. He
does join one wound unto another, and add sorrow unto sorrow, that does hurt
unto him that he receives wrong of: thou can not do thine enemy so much
harm by any froward answer that thou can give him, as he did harm unto
him self by speaking evil against thee: he that hates his enemy does in
effect as much, as if he should go about to bereue a dead man of his life.

In no one thing can thou better show thy self to be a true christian,
then in loving thine enemies. If thou do love him that loves thee: Mat. 5.
do not the Infidels as much? To love thine enemy is the very true property
of a christian.

In this does the gospel of Christ far exceed all other laws that be
written. The malice of thine enemy is very poison, but yet of poison is the
fine treacle made: and so may thou make of the malice of thine enemy a good
medecin for thine own soul.

Thou must put unto this poison other things of good substance, as to give
thine enemies meat when they be hungry: to cloathe them when they be naked:
to give them alms when they be poor, and so shall thou make of this poison
compounded with these other good receytes, an wholesome medicine to cure all
spiritual diseases.

THE LOVE OF A MAN'S own self, does so occupy his understanding, that yt
takes away clean the knowledge of God, and of his neighbor, and shuts
unto him the gate of everlasting salvation. CHAP. 9.
GO out of thine own country, and from thy kindred, Gene. 12.
and forsake the dwelling of thy father and thy mother: said God unto Abraham
the patriarcke. Thou must depart from all thy earthly affections, lest thou
fall in love with the things of this world, and forget Jesus Christ: forsake
the love of these visible things, for the love of invisible and heavenly
things.

Thou must pluck up thine affections by the root, that they do not grow up
and spring again. The over louinge of a man's self, is the cause of all his
woe: self love peruerteth judgment, it darkeneth the understanding, it
destroys our will, and shuts the gate of salvation, it neither knows God
nor his neighbor, it banisheth away virtue, it seeks after honors and
delights in the love of the world. He that so loves his life (says our
Lord) does loose his life. Io. 12.


The root of all iniquity is self love: Esau, Heb. 12. 1 Re. 15. 2. Mac. 9.
Saul, and Antiochus, never obtained pardon of their sins, although that
with sorrow and tears, they sought it at gods hand, because that all their
sorrow was for them selves, and their own harms and losses, and not for that
they had offended god, They sought them selves, they sought not god. But thou
must seek God in all thine actions, and bend thy self, only unto him.

The love of a man's self, is like unto the heart in the body of man, that
commands and rules the flesh, veins and finewes. Self love does guide and
direct a sinner, to all mischeefes and harms. Why do thou desire honor,
riches, or pleasure, but because thou love thy self too much? But the little
esteemynge of a man's own self, makes him acceptable both unto God and man.
The love of a man's self, is like unto a treason, that deserves both loss of
goods and of life.

If self love reign in thee: thou may well know what thou desire, but
thou see not what will do thee good. Thou art blind, and therefore thou
deseruest not to be believed: unto a passionate mind, there is no credit to
be given. Never take thy will for reason, which is an enemy unto God.

O how great a punnishemente is a man's own will unto him self: If that would
cease, hell would soon cease also. VVhereupon does the fire of hell work, but
upon the will of man? And if any persecution or trouble afflict thee, what is
the cause of thine affliction, but thine own proper will. Of that comes all
thy grief, and all thy torment, take away thy will, and there will remain no
matter of torment, and until that be gone, thy pain shall never cease. It is
not possible for thee to love God as thou sholdest do, and not to take away
thine own proper love.

There be certain precious stones, which if they touch some kind of mettle,
they loose their virtue, and by some other again they increase it. And love
being a most precious stone, does loose his virtue being put upon thy self,
but if that thou put it upon God it grows and increases.

Of thy great conuersing with thy self, grows thy much loving of thy self:
and so if thou would converse with God, thy love to him would increase. A man
that is all his life long brought up in a feelie sheep cote, waxes so
blind in the lyking thereof, that he thinks that place to be better then all
other places in the world besides: In like manner, by thy much conuersing with
thy self, thou growest in love and lyking with thy self.

Thou never intreatest of any thing, but that which touches thy profit: thou
medlest not with any matter, but that which concerns thy commodity. And thus
being always busied about thy self, and thine own matters, thou growest
into an over great likinge, and love with thy self. If the Apostle did so
much love God, that he said, nothing could separate him from Christ, do not
thou marueill thereat, when him self said also, our conversation is in
heaven. Romans 8.


The holy Apostle conuersed much with God, and little with him self, and
therefore he loved God much, and him self but a little. Let thy mind run
still upon God, be thou always occupied in thinking of him by some deuow^e
prayer, or holy meditation, and by the means of such good exercises, it is
impossible, but that thou shall love God, being such, as he is, when thou
did by much exercises bestowed about thy self, and conuersing with thy
self, fall in love with thy self, being such as thou art.

By these two loves, there are two cities builded. The love of God with the
despisinge of thy self, is the one, and the love of thy self with despisinge
of God, is the other: And between both these, that is betwixt God and thy self
stands thy will, which the nearer that it draws unto thee, so much goes it
further from God. And so much as it draws nearer unto God, so much goes it
further from thee, by the despisinge of thy self. And contrariewise, it may
grow so near unto thee by the great love that thou bear unto thy self,
that it may grow unto the despisinge of God.

Had not these two pronownes so much rayned meum* and tuum, mine and thine
there had not been so great discord and disagreement in the world, as there
is. Self love is cause of all debate and discord in Cities and civil places.
And because many love their own proper commodity, more then thee common
profit of others, therefore be there so many defectes, and so great decay in
the commonwealth.

The Apostle says, 2. Tim. 3.
that in the latter days, there shall come men, which shall be great lovers of
them selves, covetous, proud, blasphemous persons and full of ^ice. And of all
this mischief, whereof the Apostle speaks, self love is the ^earie cause,
and chief ground: and therefore he set it in the first place, as the vearie
foundation, whereupon all the rest did stand.

Nothing does a man so much harm ^s to have his own will. That is the
foundation whereon rests the whole disorder of sin, and whereupon the ^oue
of the world does settle and stay. Take away that foundation of self love, and
down will all the walls of Ierico fall which be the vanities of this world,
Ios. 6.
and the follies which thou have so much esteemed.

THE TRVE PERFECTION of a Christian, consists not only in despisinge of
temporal things: but he must also despise him self, and wholy deny his
own proper will. CHAP. 10.
HE that will follow me (says Christ) let him deny him self. Luc. 9.
The vearie way to come unto Christ, is to conquer thine own will: To suffer
necessity with patience, and not to seek thine own proper commodity.

The very true seruante of God seeks not his own interest, but the glory and
honor of God. In all thy good deeds thou must seek to please God, and thou
shalt receive therefore greater benifites at his hand: let him be the
beginning and end of all thy works, to the end thou may not loose the
fruit of all thy travails.

It is a dangerous disease to have to great a love to thy self, he that
seeks him self, is sure to find him self: good works which be done for
gods sake do glade the conscience, illuminate the understanding, and deserve
increase of grace. Many do despise the exterior things which they have, but
for all that, they come not unto the perfection which the gospel requires,
which is the denying of them selves, whereby it appears that ^hey have not
yet cast away their own will, because they do keep still with them some of
that self love which made the snare, wherewith they were first taken.

The true seruante of Jesus Christ, must not only make small account of ^is
temporal goods, but he must also set ^ittle by him self, that he be not
hyndered ^hereby in his way toward heaven.

Let him learn now by the grace of ^he holy Ghost to overcome him self, that
has learned before to despise all worldly things. This is the perfect
re^ouncinge of a man's will, when he is with ^art contented to despise him
self, and ^ot seek for any comfort in any thing ^f this world. If thou
do seek thine ^wne profit, or temporal commodity, ^hou art not yet
perfectly mortified: vn^^ll the seruante of Jesus Christ, does ^hroughlie
deny him self, he deserves ^ot to receive the heavenly comfort.

Many that have had at the first, some ^euotion, and spiritual consolation,
have ^herein continued for a short time, but after when they perceived their
devotion ^n prayer to have failed them, and therewithal their spiritual
consolation, (which ^hey sought after,) to have decayed in them, as men not
contented therewith have given the^ selves to the world again which they had
before cast of. And th^^ they took no profit by all that they did because they
had not gotten the perfect^ victory of them selves, nor throughli^ mortified
them selves, they would not b^ contented wholly to forsake them selue^*

Set only before thine eyes, the se^^uice of god* And then though thou doe^^
not sensibly perceive any present co^fo^^ in that which thou do, yet ought
it (...) be a sufficient comfort unto thee to know and to remember, that thou
art occupie^ in his service, and that it is his will tha^ thou sholdest have no
further comfor^ thereby, then he should think expedie^^ for thee. Thou must
utterly deny th^^ self, in all things that thou go abou^^ if thou will
thoroughly profit in the ser^uice of God. Many will be well contente^ to deny
them selves in certain thinge^ but not in all. They will be obedient in a^^
things that shall like them, but in thos^ things which stand not with their
likin^ there they will stagger at it, and will no^ cast of them selves, nor
deny them selue^ as they ought to do. But thou must in a^^ things be ready
to yield unto gods wi^^ and utterly forsake thy self, and thy^^ own will.

Mat. 13.
That careful marchante which the gospel speaks of was well contente^ to
sell all that he had, leauinge him self ^^thinge to buy the precious pearl
with^^. Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5
were punnished ^^th sudden death, because they gave but ^^^te of the price of
the field which they ^^de, unto God, and kept part still unto ^^em selves. If
thou will serve God, thou ^^st be contented to sell all without kee^^nge any
part at all unto thy self. And (...) thou will get this most precious pearl,
^^ou must first thoroughly conquer thy ^^fe. By the full denyinge of our own
^^ll, the will of God has full domynio^ in (...) and the will of man is so
transfourmed ^o the will of God, that he suffers wil^^^glie any adversity
for him. If thou ^^^test perfect victory of thy self, in a ^^^rt time thou
shall much profit.

Our Savior Jesus Christ sought (...) his own glory, but thine, Io. 8.
he came (...) hither for his own commodity, but (...) thine. And why do
not thou forget (...) self and seek him, that was contented (...) much to
forget him self and his own ^^^rie, as to give him self wholly for ^^^ee?

A good wife is she, that seeks to ^^ase none but her husband, and happy is
^^^t chaste soul, that goes not about to ^^ase any but her spouse Jesus
Christ. ^^d blessed is that soul, which seeks to ^ntent God, and estemeth no
other love ^^the world, besides the love of him. ^^ou may be sure, that thy
spouse is ^^od, and well worthy to be beloved for him self. And therefore thou
must be contented, to forget every thing for his love.

Thou ought to forsake eueri^ thing, and to deny thy self, and all th^^
thou have, for to obtain the sweet com^forte of the love of Jesus Christ.

A PERFECT CHRISTIAN does not only despise honor, riches, an^ every other
commodity of this vvorld^ but desires also for the love of Christ to be
despised and contemned, and th^^ good which he does, he does it not f^^ his
own spiritual comfort, but for th^^ love of God, and for to do him serui^^
CHAP. 11.
LET us not refuse the batay^^ which is offered us, Heb. 12.
alway^^ having Jesus Christ in o^^ eye, who suffered upon th^^ Cross all the
dispite an^ shame that might be done (...) him, and regarded it not: says the
A^postle. So must thou despise all inord^^nate affection of humane praise,
hono^^ and favor, and desire for God his sake (...) suffer all dispite and
confusion.

There be but few which seek aft^^ ^^ese virtues: Although there be some ^ot
desirous of honor, yet be there but ^ery few, which from the bottom of their
^^rte, desire to be despised and contem^ed: and if thou do desire these
things ^ith thine heart, God will grant them unto thee: and if he does not
send thee ^^uersitie, it is because he knows that ^^ou art not strong
enough to bear it, ^^or art yet sufficiently mortified.

God is not more ready to do any thing, ^^en to send affliction and
tribulation unto one that is meet to receive it, which (...) the mortified
man, because he knows ^^erein to consiste his chief merit, to which he
desires to bring his best belo^ed friends.

All things that thou do ask of ^od, and would have of him, which
per^eyne not to the due mortification and ^espising of thy self for gods sake,
have ^^mewhat contained in them, that is tem^ered with thy natural passions,
and thine ^wne se^fe love: and although in part ^hou haste put away from thee
the love of ^hy self, yet secretly returns it to thee ^gayne, by seeking
somewhat of thy self and thine own commodity, which thou ^ast not ware of:
and so many times when ^e think that we are far from our selves, ^e find at
last our selves to be to near unto our selves, whereof it comes that ^hou
which wishedst for great adversity, ^oest find thy self to faint at a
little which happens thee because thou doe^^ not perfectly despise thy
self. The lou^ of thy self was hidden for a time, bu^ when it was touched a
little, it began (...) show it self again, although it do lie^^ sleep
for a while, thou must not think^ therefore that it is dead: but he is happi^
in deed, which is so dead to him self that he desires to be of all folks
despi^sed.

Our Lord gave us a wonderful example of perfect mortification, when (...)
said upon the cross. O my God why (...) thou forsaken me? Mat. 27.
The perfect seruante (...) Jesus Christ, ought so to content him self when he
is forsaken, that yet he faint (...) therein albeit he be deprived of all
sens^^ble spiritual consolation for a time, as ou^ redeemer was upon the
cross.

Many commit spiritual adultery, (...) appointing with them selves to make
sen^sible devotion, the uttermost end of th^^ which they seek for, and for
that end^ either only, or cheeflie do seek out (...) the comfort of mental
prayer. Thou must not desire thine own consolation, although it be spiritual,
but only the service of God.

Thy perfection consists not (...) these gifts of sensible love, but in th^^
essential and true love of God, and having (...) of a sound conscience, and
fulfillinge his will in all things. The seruante of Jesus Christ must not
seek* for the sweetene^ (...) sensible devotion, nor often consolation, (...)
of true mortification and despising of ^^m self, and for a right and well
ordered ^^^ention only toward God, who discer^^th betwixt the true, and the
counterfeit ^^^uante of Jesus Christ.

Happy is he which is so mortified, ^^^t he is prepared to suffer even the
^^^y pains of hell for Gods sake and his ^^nscience.

Happy is he that is as well disposed ^^^e without these gifts of inward
com^^^e and sensible devotion, as to have ^^^m.

Happy is he that is so inflamed with (...) fire of the essential, and very
perfect ^^^e of God, that he is well contented, e^^^ from the bottom of his
heart, to be ^^^ryued all his life long, of all sensible ^^^e, satisfienge him
self with the bare ^^e^tiall love of God only, not esteeminge (...) regarding
at all the inward spiritual ^^^^ort, although it be never so grievous ^^to
him to forbear yt.

Happy is he that earnestly desires (...) follow his master Jesus Christ,
that was ^^^saken on the cross of all his temporal ^^^odes and honors, and
also of all spi^^^uall comfort. But there be many which ^^^en they find them
selves naked and ^^^ren of all spiritual comfort, they be^^me all dull,
slothful, and melancolique. (...) to rejoice when a man is void of all ^^ese
inward spiritual comfortes and sweetness, is a sure token of pure and pe^^fect
love to God.

Happy is that soul, that is so dea^^ to yt self and the world, that yt
lyue^ only to God, without the help of (...) other external or internal
affection whatsoever. So shall it be pure without sin, quiet without
disturbance, (...) without fear, adorned with virtue, ligh^^ned in
understanding, lifted up in spiri^^ united unto God, and eternally beatifie^^

OUR SOVLE AND BODI^ have contynuall battle together, (...) if the victory
happen upon the bo^^ behalf, then are both body and so^^ subject to the
condemnation of hell fi^^ but if the soul obtain the victory, b^^^ of them
are crowned with heauen^^ glory for ever. CHAP. 12.
THE life of man is a con^^^nual war upon the ear^^ says holy Job. Job. 7.
Thou ca^^not live without battay^^ and wheresoever thou (...) thou shalt
find war, (...) thou shall always find within thee, (...) that is ever
against thee.

In one man does the Apostle set down unto us two men, 2. Cor. ^
so joined together and ^o co^pact, that the one cannot be without the other,
neither can they deuyde them selves in participating either of pain, or of
glory. And yet is there such diversity betwixt them in their affections and
appe^^its, that the life of the one, is the death of ^he other. They be so
lincked and annexed together, that being two they be yet but ^ne, and being
one, they be nevertheless ^wo: Betwixt these two passes the wholle ^ate and
course of our life, wherefore the ^postle has attributed unto the^ both,
sundry titles and names, calling the one the spi^ite, the other the flesh the
one the soul, ^he other the body: the one the law of the ^oule, the other the
law of the mem^ers. The one the inward man, the other ^he outward man. Walk
according to ^he spirit (says the Apostle) and you shall ^ot do the works
of the flesh. You shall ^ye, if you live according to the flesh, and you shall
live, if with the spirit you ^ill mortify the flesh. The flesh coueteth
against the spirit, and the spirit against ^he flesh.

This is a strange kind of warfare, that in the battaill is peace sought, and
in ^eace is battaill desired. In death is life, and (...) life death, In
bondage is liberty* In li^ertie bondage. The liberty and power of a good man
is showed in ouercommyng him self, and subduing of his passions.

To refrain thine appetites is very fortitude of the mind, and in following
them the weakness thereof is bewrayed* He is rather to be accounted a strong
ma^^ that conquereth his appetites then he tha^ conquereth his enemies. If thou
seeke^ for a great domynyon, learn to reign^ over thy self, for Solomon
says: He tha^ ouercometh him self is better then (...) that conquereth great
towns. Pro. 16
There (...) many that do conquer cities, but the^^ are but few that can
co^quere them selue^

To be lord and ruler of a man's self, (...) a very large empire: If thou
can perfec^^lie overcome thy self, thou shall easeli^ overcome every other
thing. He is to b^ called a perfect good soldier, that ha^^ throughlye
ouercomen him self. H^ is the true seruante of Jesus Christ, which makes the
flesh subject to the spirit^ which subdueth sensuality unto reason^ and if
thou be ouercomen, thou art b^ thine own fault ouercomen. 1. Cor. 10.
For th^^ blessed Apostle says: God is faithful, an^ will not suffer you to
be tempted, about that which you be able to bear.

It is the manner of those which (...) Judges in combattes, to measure the
wea^pons of those that are to fight together (...) the listes. So God that is
the Judge of th^^ world, does take the just measure of o^^ weapons, and will
not suffer that our ene^my shall fight against us with greater temp^^ations,
then we be able to bear.

And if true men be entered the feeld to ^^ght, they being both equal in all
points ^e must needs carry away the victory, ^^at his helped by an other.

If thou will favor thy body with ^dlenes and overmuch eating and drinking
^^y body shall be victorious and thy soul ^halbe ouercomen. But if thy soul be
^olpen with fasting, watching, and praying ^^y soul shall win the victory,
and thy ^odie shall be ouercomen.

It is far more fit and conuenyent for he to give thine aid and favor unto
^hy soul, then to thy body, for if the vi^torie fall unto the soul, then is
the ^oule and body both saved thereby. But ^f the victory remain to the
body, then ^re soul and body both cast away for ever.

The body loses by victory, and ^ynneth when it is ouercomen, If the ^ody
do overcome, it shall be perpetu^lly tormented with the soul for ever: and
^eing conquered, it shall live with the ^^ule for ever with Christ. The
victory ^f the body is shameful, and approbrious, ^ut to be ouercomen is an
honor unto it. The conqueringe of it, is glorious unto it self, and the
triumph thereof is infa^ous.

If that thou do love thy flesh, thou ^anst not do more for it then make it
subject unto reason, and the^ do thou most of all ^ate it, when thou make
most of it. He that hates it, loves it

Jesus Christ says, He that hates this sensual life in this world, Io. 12.
he keeps it for everlasting life: And he shall loose it that for the
keepinge of it in this world, does set to much by it. Now behold how glorious
the victory of thy soul is, and how much thou do get by subduing of thy
passions.

Let thy soul be favored and succored by reducing sensuality unto the
obedience of the spirit, for the battayll is shorter, the victory more
glorious, and the crown^ more triumphant. Thou must not spa^^ thy labor if thou will have a reward. For reward is given to none, Apoc. 2.
but to them that do take pain for yt. Be thou faithful unto the end (for
our lord says) that he will give thee the crown of life.

A GODLY INSTRVCTION to teach thee to know thy self, of which knowledge
does after grovve unto thee, the knowledge of our Lord God. CHAP. 13.
THE invisible things of God (says the Apostle) are seen and perceived by
his visible creatures. Romans 1.
If any creature in this world, does by the creation thereof, declare unto us,
the great wisdom and the omnipotency of God, no other creature shows it so
much, Gene. 2.
or gives so great manyfestation thereof unto us, as man which is made to the
Image, and likeness of God him self,

Many know many things and know nothing of them selves: they see other men
but they see not them selves: they seek God by exterior things, leauinge the
inward things by which God is found in deed: descend down into the
interior part of thine heart, for so much as thou do profit in learning to
know thy self, so much proceedest thou also in learning to know who God is:
and although that by the knowledge of the noble state of the mind, the true
and perfect knowledge of Gods greatness is best and most plainly showed, yet
to abase thy pride withal, thou haste always before thine eyes the misery of
the body, and the shortenes of thy life, that thou may come by that way unto
God.

Prou. 1.
In knowing of thy self thou will humble thy self, and in humbling thy self
thou will fear God: and because the fear of God is the beginning of thy
salvation, thou must begin first with the knowledge of thy self.

If thou will see thy self and know who thou art, thou must take a glass
and behold thy self in it: the glass that a man may best behold him self
in, is an other man: and if the other man that thou beholdest be but earth,
worms, and ashes, thou may well account thy self for such a one also, be
thine estate, riches or dignity never so great, whereunto thou art exalted
in this world: and yet because thou may not be deceived by the glass, see
that thou take not a glass that is holowe within, for that shows the thing
that is represented therein, contrary to that which it is in deed, but thou
must look in a plain glass, which shows thee the very truth what man is:
If thou beholdest thy self in the inside of a silver spoone that is clean and
clear, thou shall see thy face with the wrong end turned upward, thy bearde
to stand upward, and ^^y forehead downward. So there are in ^^an two glasses,
which be the two states (...) which thou may behold thy self: ^^^e is
life, the other is death.

Life is the holowe glass, which shew^^th thy face clean contrary to that it
is in ^^eede: it shows thee to be sound, strong, and lusty, and that thou
shalt live many ^^eares, and all is but vanity and lies. If ^hou espiest
therein fresh lusty youth, do ^ot thou trust therein, for it is very
de^eytfull. Beauty is also very deceytfull: ^hou seem strong when thou art
but weak: this false life seems unto man to ^e some great thing, but it is
in deed contrary to that which it seems and re^resenteth. But the state of
death is the very plain and true glass, which shows ^hinges truly as they
are in deed, without any deceyte at all.

If thou will therefore (O man) know ^ruly who thou art, behold an other man,
not a quick living man, but one that is dead: and there shalt thou see how
that thou art earth and ashes, a very cave of filth and uncleanness, a little set
out and bewtified on the out side, by the lively hew that life has lent thee:
there shalt thou see the foundation of thy parentage, there shall thou know
how large thy dominon is, that which thou art they were, and that which they
are, thou shalt be.

If thou will well behold thy self, thou shalt find small cause why thou
sholdest make any great account of thy self: what is man in respect of his
body, but a vessel fraughte full of corruption? And what is he in respect of
his soul, (setting a side the grace of God) but an enemy unto justice, an
heir of hell, a friend of vanity, a worker of iniquity, a despiser of God, a
creature most apt to all evil, and most unable to do good* What art thou
but a most miserable creature, in all things that do apperteyne unto thee? In
thy counsayles thou art blind, in thy ways ignorant, in thy word^ vain, in
thy works faulty, in thine appetites filthy, and finally in all thy doing^
vile, and only great in thine own estimation: it is a noble exercise to
learn well to know thy self.

Seek to know thy self, and thou shalt cut of much mischief: thou shalt
not be proud nor ambitious: thou shalt not be a despiser of others: thou
shalt suffer all injuries with patience, knowing thy self to be a miserable
sinner, and well worthy of all creatures to be despised.

This singular saying (know thy self) is a word descended from heaven above
for what good does it thee to know all the seven liberal sciences, and to be
a Doctor in all faculties, and not to know^ thy self at all? The humble
knowing (...) thy self is more worth, then to know a^^ much as is written in
the world: know first who thou art, whence thou came, where (...) thou art,
and whether thou art goinge: thou art a mortal man, a little earth, a vessel
of corruption, and full of much mise^ie and necessity: thou came cryinge
from thy mothers belly, thou art concey^ed in sin, environed about with all
^aungers, and going toward thy grave. Job. 30.


Job says: I am likened unto mire, and to the snuff of a candle. Let the
light ^f Gods grace shine upon thee, and then ^halt thou know who thou art:
thou say ^hou art rich, and have need of nothing, but in truth thou art
poor and beggarly, ^lthough thou know it not.

THERE IS NOT ANY CREAture in this world more poor and miserable then man,
who can not get his living, nor any thing perteynynge tovvard it, without
pain and travail, and that vvhereon he lives must be had of creatures much
inferior to him self. CHAP. 14.
A MAN that is, borne of a woman, Job. 4.
lives but a short time, and is full of many miseries, says holy Job, What
thing is so miserable as man? This body which thou so ^uch esteemest, in the
grave must lie a rotting. And what thing is more horrible then a dead man? He
may not remain among his friends one day above the ground after he is dead.
How much so ever they loved him when he was a live* yet when he is dead they
may not abid^ him.

The state wherein thou live, is an unhappy servitude: It is a miserable
life to be borne a slave, to live one and to die one, David says, In iniquity
was I conceived* A life that is so compassed about with travail, Psalm. 50.
pain and sorrow as ours is, which for one pleasure receives (...) thousand
sorrows, may well be accounted, rather a death, then a life.

There is no creature more poore^ then a man, he is so needy of all things
that he is feign to borowe his very garments that he is clothed withal,
eue^ from the sely beasts backs. And that which he lives on, his vearie
meat, must he begge^^ of the birds of the air, and beasts of the field, And
the bread that is his chief food, he must get with the sweat of his brows:
All which for the most part, the birds and brute beasts have of the^ selves,
and have no need to beg, or to ask of any other.

Some living creatures have wings to fly withal, others have nails and
^^eth* both to defend them selves, and to offend and hurt others, And others
have lightness and swiftenes to fly and escape those dangers which they be
subject too. Of all which things the poor miserable man is void, for of him
self he has nothing, and that which he has he has taken it from some other
creatures, that be inferior and of less force then him self. By this ^e may
learn to humble him self, and to abate the pride and the arrogancy, which he
is holden withal.

He can not have any continual peace ^or quietness, for he can not continually
^tand still, nor always walk, nor always ^leepe or watch: when a man is best
in health, ^e has a thousand infirmities, which be ^unger, thurst, sleep,
wearines, and other ^ecessities, wherewith he abounds, as ^olde, heat,
tempests, lightnynges, thun^ers, pestilences, poison, serpents, dangers by
sea, dangers by land, sorrows, ^ickenes, and death.

Who cold be in more safety then ^^ly the Priest of God was, and yet sitting
^uyetlie in a chair in his own house, he ^^ll and brake his neck. So little
suertie ^s the^e any where to be found.

The sleep which thou take for thy cheifest quiet and repose, is full of
false ^maginatio^s, and vain dreams whereby ^hou art often times molested. It
is an ^nmeasurable blindness, and A vearie ex^reeme folly, to love this vile
miserable world, so full of many miseries, where if any good be it is myngled
with infirmity sorrows and calamities which are to those that take delight
therein, the vearie begynninges of the perpetual great miseries and pains of
hell.

It is an easier thing to suffer any misery, then still to look for yt, and
expect it: And seeing that thou look every day for the sentence of death,
thou must needs perceive thereby, the misery of this pre^ent life which thou
now enioyest. So in scripture, this life is not properly called life, nor this
corporal death, is called death, 3. Reg. 2.11.14.15
but sleep. God ordained that this life should be so paynefull, to the end that
thou might take a love to the other life which is to come.

Consider how this life was given thee, as it were a ship, for to carry thee
like a trauayllour through the tempesteous seas of this world, wherein thou
were to endure many dangers, to the intent that thou might more earnestly
desire the other life, which is the sure harborowgh and glorious haven of
heaven.

If this life should have been all prosperous and pleasant, it would so have
draw^^ a man to the love and likinge thereof, that he would quyte have forgotten
the veari^ true life, for the which he was in deed^ created. But the miseries
which thou suffer, and the difficulties which thou endurest, and ar^
compassed about withal do inuit thee to the love of heaven* The pains
which thou abidest here, compel thee to make haste unto God. The afflictions
which thou do here suffer, what do they seem to cry and call upon thee,
but that thou sholdest not love this miserable life?

Cast not the ancker of thine heart upon such moveable and uncertain
commodities as this life brings forth. It is for thy benfite that God does
compass thee about, with so many miseries, to the end that thou sholdest
keep in memory, and have always in thy mind, that this is not the life,
which thou wast created for. Here art thou made subject to contynuall
contention and trouble, to the end that by thy conqueringe of them thou may
get a crown of glory: He would have that this life should be paynefull unto
thee, and full of business, for as much as thou being by nature a friend and a
lover of rest and quyetnes, thou sholdest take pleasure and delighte in the
true rest of heaven.

IT IS NOT SVFFICIENT only to know that there is a God, but requisite also
for us to understand all such particularities, as his divine Majesty, will
give us leave to know. CHAP. 15.
MINE eyes do now behold thee, and I do penance in ashes, Job. 42.
(says holy Job unto God). Since thou wast made to know God, open thine
eyes, to the end thou may know him.

Of the knowledge of God, comes the knowledge of thy self, and by the knowing
of thy self, grows the knowledge of God: and therefore said Job: Mine eyes
do behold thee, and for that cause in ashes I will do penance.

By thy knowing God, thou art moved to reverence him, and if thou know him
not, thou do a^ he does that passes by a great Prince, and for want of
knowing him, passes by him without any reverence given him. The poor country
man meets with the King in the field, and talks with him, and does no
duty unto him, because he knows him not. Marvel not that the holy men of
old time did so humble them selves when they came before the presence of God,
Leu. 11.
for they knew him to be the King of heaven, and therefore they fell flat
prostrate on the ground before him: and do thou most heartily pray unto God
with tears, that he will give thee the grace to know thy self.

Do not thou deceive thy self, by thinking that thou do fully know God,
when thou do but know only that ^here is a God, and beleeuest that which
holy Church believes. A rude rusticall ^heepeheard that never went further
then his flock and his sheep cote, may have (...) certain gross knowledge
of the king, when he hears other men report of him, that he is rich and
mighty, and has ^ower to punnish others, whereby he conceyueth some reverence
ought to be given him.

If thou do know no more but that he is God, thou will make but small
account of him, but thou must know also that it is he which does minister
justice, and that does punnish thee when thou offendest, to the end thou
may fear him: ^hou must know his great mercyes, to the ^ntent thou may
put thy confidence in them: thou must learn to know the great ^reasures which
he has in store for his friends, that thou may thereby the rather fulfill
his will.

Thou must further also consider his great goodness, that without any merit or
desert of thine, or without any need that him self had of thee, came of his
own voluntary good will to seek thee, and with his infinite grief and
pains to redeem thee, because he did so dearly love thee.

Consider also his great power, his wisdom, and his infinite greatness, by all
which thou may gather occasion to reverence him, Psa. 114.
to fear him, and to serve him: If thou beleeuest God to be good, seek with
all diligence after that goodness, and all that which thou know to be in him.

Deu. 14.
God would not have any other beast^ offered up in sacrifice to him, then such a^
did ruminate or chue their cudde, which is mente by such men as do
conti^nually meditate in their mind, and reuolue by contemplation the
perticularities of such things as God has created, that by those means they
may come to the more particular understanding and distinct knowledge of our
Lord.

Eccl. 2.
Labor to know thy God and thy Lord. It is written, that the eyes of a wise
man do stand in his head. Which is not meant by the bodily eyes, for both the
eyes of the wise man, and of the fool too, do stand in their head, but it is
meant, by the eyes of our understanding, which the wise man has always fast
fixed in that head which is by the Apostle said, Ephesians. 4.
to be Jesus christ him self.

VVilt thou know who God is? be^olde who thou art by him, and behold ^ho he is
by thy self. Thou must take ^way the earth which the love of the ^orld, has
set before the eyes of thine ^nderstandinge, if thou will know him.

Before that God made him self ^nowen unto Moses, Exodus 3.
he commanded ^ym to pluck of his shoes, God will never ^t thee know who he
is, except thou first ^emoue away from thee all thy worldly ^ffections.

When our redeemer did reveal his ^lorie unto his three disciples, he made
them go up from the valley to the top ^f the mount Thabour, Mat. 17.
where they saw ^ym transfigured.

When thou will likewise ascend to ^e deep knowledge and contemplation of God
thou must despise with all thine heart, the low baseness of this world.

WITH THE WINGS OF meditation and contemplation a man ought to lift up his
heart to love the infinite goodness of God, for perfection consists in love,
and not in contemplation. CHAP. 16.
Psalm. 38.
IN my meditation is the fire kindeled, says the Prophet David. For to kyndle
the fire of gods love in thy will, and to have the mo^^ perfect knowledge of
God* meditation, and Contemplation, be both most necessary: Betwixt both which
there is no other difference, but that meditation is an exercise more paynefull
and difficul^ in the matters perteynynge to God: And contemplation is more
easy and swee^ to them that have had the exercise thereof. But neither in the
one, nor in the other of them, consists our perfection, but i^ the love of
God only. Contemplation i^ the work of our understanding, and a wa^ and a
mean unto our perfection, but i^ lifting up our will unto God, by vnitin^ our
will unto his will, and by pure louin^ of him consists our perfection.

The sweetenes of our delighte is not in contemplation but in hearty loving.
The understanding does not give sustenance unto our soul, but only prepares
the meat that our soul is fed withal. But ^he understanding and the will
together, ^oe minister food to the soul: there is no ^leasant taste nor
savor, in preparing that which must be eaten, but in eating of that which is
prepared.

Seeinge that the object of our will, or that thing which our will does tend
unto, (...) always that which is good, so that no^hinge can be beloved, but
that which is ^ood, or else taken for good, under the co^^r of some thing that
is good. If then ^ur understanding does show forth and ^emonstrate unto our
will, the bottomless (...) of gods infinite goodness, that will ^olde appear to
be but vearie cold, which would not straight ways burn like ^^to another
phoenix, with the love of God, ^hen by co^templation the bright beams (...) the
son of Justice should shine in upon (...)* Let the wings of good and deuowte
^editation, blow the fire of earnest love (...) thine heart, that thou may
be renewed (...) the flame of that fire, as the phoenix is, ^^d thereby
acknowledginge thy self for (...) better then ashes and woormes meat, ^eaue
wholly unto God, and love him, ^^d to his infinite goodness refer thy ^^^fe,
by yelding thy will unto his almigh^^e will and pleasure.

If thou will have the sweetness of prayer, and be comforted and refreshed
therein by contemplation, then must thou lift up thy will wholly unto God,
that thou may thereby get the full fruit of thy contemplation.

Some are exercised only in the intellectual part, and not in the affectuall
part of their will, and their end is not to be kindled with the love of God,
but only to have a curious knowledge of God* by means whereof they be still
thinking how our Lord was borne, how he lived, how he suffered, and how he rose
agayn^ and other such like things of him, supposing the contemplative life to
consis^^ only in that: but they are far from the true contemplative life in
deed, if they fix their felicity in the knowledge and pure speculation of
such mysteries: for the true contemplation must be fastened an^ grounded in the
most effectual and bur^ning love of God, unto which thou mu^^ join and unite
thine own will and affection: so as all the imperfection of thin^ own
mortification, may be made perfect and pure through him and his love.

All thine exercises, and thine actions must be ordained for the true love o^
God, and not to get the knowledge o^ God, making that the only end of all thy
labor: If thou haste gotten any knowledge of God, thou must not stay there, but
tho^ must proceed on therewithal, to g^ ^^ereby the love of God.

The contemplative persons, because ^hey know the secrets of God, (as those
that enter into his priuye chamber) are ^alled his friends, as the holy
Apostles ^ere, unto whom our Lord said: Io.
I do ^^all you my friends, because I have decla^ed unto you all those things
which I ^aue heard of my Father. But those that ^re exercised in the active
life are called ^is servants.

Contemplation is the beginning of ^lory, whereby a man first begins to
^nowe God and him self: which being once gotten, he falls out of love with
this world, and thereby getteh great force toward the serving of God.

HE THAT WILL LYVE with Christ, must first die to the world, the flesh, and
his own disordinate appetites and desires. CHAP. 17.
FOR thy love are we mortified all day, Psalm. 43.
(says the Prophet,) speaking unto God. Happy is that soul whose life is
Jesus Christ. To die to Christ is gain, Phil. 1.
but he must first die to him self, that will live unto Jesus Christ whilst
thou live in this flesh, thou must die to the world, to the end that after
thy death, thou may live for ever with Christ.

Thou shall be quiet within, if thou go not wandering too far abroad. He
that to fervently follows outward things, must needs wax cold in the
inward things which tend toward the love of God. Gene. 21.
Sara being so old a woman, that all fleshly appetites were dead in her,
yet brought forth Isacke that was the joy and the gladness of his father. And
if all thy disordinate appetites, and the desires of this world, be not dead
in thee, thou shall ^euer obtain the true joy of the spirit. ^or after that
Sara was full mortified in ^^esh, she brought forth the son of the ^pirite.

Christ died to the end that they which ^iue might not live unto them selves, 1
Cor. 5.
but unto him that died for them and rose ^gayne.

Abraham received not the circum^ision, Gene. 17.
until his goinge out of his own ^ountrey. I live, Gal. 2. Mat. 2.
(says the Apostle) but ^ot I, it is Christ that lives in me. When ^erode
was dead Christ returned from ^gypte to Israel again: until that you be
^ortified, Christ will not come unto the ^oule.

And to the end that Christ may enter unto your souls* it is necessary first
that ^^nne be dead in you, and that the outward ^an may live, the inward man
must be mortified. If thou do kill Herod, Jesus Christ will come to thee.
Col. 3.
The Apostle ^ayth, you be dead, and your life is laid ^p with Christ. Thou
die, when thou ^orsakest to be such as thou wast. If we ^oe live to the
spirit, let us walk accor^ing to the spirit, says the Apostle. And ^f you
live according to the flesh, Gal. 5. Col. 3.
you shall ^ie, and if you will live according to the ^pirite, you must
mortify the works of ^he flesh says the same Apostle in another ^lace.

Saul did put agag in prison, 1. Re. 15*
when God ^o^maunded him to kill him, as many do which put their own passions
in pris^^ for a while, but they will not kill th^^ forthwith. It is not
sufficient for the, (...) imprison thy passions, in keepinge th^^ from going
out, but thou must kill them, as all concupiscence and worldly desi^^ may
utterly die in thee.

Many be like the trees in wynt^^ which seem dead to the world in (...)
outward show, but when they be stur^^ up, and moved a little, then they show
th^^ selves by their words and answers, (...) be such as have their passions
still quick and lively in them. But because that (...) roots within were left
a live, they begin^ to spring forth again, as soon as the temp^tation of summer
comes upon them. Go^ said unto Saul, 3* Re. 20*
because thou have let hi^ live, that was worthy to die, thy life sha^^ go
for his. Thy soul shall die, by mean^^ of the life which thou gave unto the
body.

Make reckenyng with thy self, an^ see who it is that lives in thee. If the
fle^^ do live, then is the spirit dead. Th^^ can not give thy self to
prayer and co^^templation, without that thou be first mo^^tified, before all
other things, thou mu^^ give thy self unto mortification. Exo. 19.


God commanded that all tho^^ beasts should be stoned unto death, th^^ drew
near unto the hill where God him self appeared, and why deserves not (...)
the same punnishement, that having hi^ ^^astly passions still abiding in him,
will ^euerthelesse approach unto the high hill (...) contemplation? VVhilest our
sensual ^^ssions reign in us, then is little diffe^^nce betwixt us and
beasts.

Thou can not come to the con^^mplatiue life, but that thou must first
^egynne with the active life, Gene. 25.
Jacob was ^^st called Jacob, which is as much to say, (...) a subplanter, or
one that holds an^^her by the heel, before that he was cal^^d Israel, which
signifies one that sees ^od. For thou can not see God by con^^mplation, but
if thou do first pluck ^^^ce out of thee by the heels, and cast ^^^m
clean away by mortification of thy ^^lfe.

Mortification perteyneth to the life ^^iue. First was Lia, given unto Jacob,
Gene. 29.
which represents the actyue life, after ^^at he had served many years for
Ra^^ell, which signified the contemplative ^^fe, and although that Rachell be
first (...) Nobility and perfection, yet is she ^^^t in generation and
knowledge. Al^^ough that the contemplative life be ^^tter then the active, yet
first thou must ^^ceyue and take hold of the actyue life. ^hou must first be
married unto Lia, before ^^ou come unto Rachell. Mortefie first ^^y
sensuality, and excercyse thy self in ^orkes of humility. Learn to conquer
^^y self, and to be abstinent and patient, ^^d to bear all injuries, and so
shall thou come unto contemplation.

Daniell and his companions were great absteiners and fasters, Dan. 2.
and very chast^ withal, and by that means were the^ made capable of Gods
deuyne reuelatio^^ Many will fly without wings, but the^ profit little,
because they are not mort^^fied. Thou shall never come to the heigh^ of
contemplation, if thine affection (...) not free from all things that are
vnde^ heaven, and so ravished with the love o^ God, that thou have gotten the
perfec^ knowledge how to despise thy self f^^ God.

The pure love of God, makes (...) spirit simple, and so free from all
worl^^lie things, that it may without all pay^^ and labor fly up unto God.

If thou were dead to the world, the world would be dead to thee also, as i^
was unto the Apostle. Gal. 6.
Even as the sea re^teyneth those men that be living in it, an^ casts away
those out of it to the sh^^ which are dead, so does the world hono^ those that
live to the world, and does those away from it that mortefie them selves for
Christ.

IT IS MEET FOR US TO mortefie and chasten our flesh, by absteynyng from
meat, to the end, that when our sensual appetites be tamed, we may with
more ease obey the spirit. CHAP. 18.
YOU shall die if you will live according to the flesh, Romans 8.
says the Apostle. Thou shall never be able to serve the spirit, except thou will be abstinent and penitent in thy ^yfe. The ship that carries to great a
^urthen sincketh therewithal into the ^ottome of the sea, and if thou do
charge (...) body with to much meat, thou will ^^owne thy soul in the sea of
sin.

The devil by eating overcame our ^^rst forefathers. Gene. 3.
And the first temptation ^^at ever he gave unto Job was whilst his ^^ildren
were feastinge together. Job. 1.
Absti^ence and austeritie of life, be both ne^essarie for our mortification.

God provided meat for all other ^yuinge creatures, Gene. 1.
before he provided any ^^or man, to teach us how little care we ^^olde take
in providing for our belly.

Act 9. 1. Cor. 9.
Saint Paul knowinge him self to be an elect vessel, chastened his body, and
yet we that have no certentie thereof at all, but do only know our selves
to be sinners, live in pleasure and delighte. Beware you ouerlade not your
selves by over much eatinge and drinkinge says our Lord. Luc. 12.


Dan. 10.
Daniell to be the better prepared to receive the heavenly consolations, fasted
three whole weeks together, and neither eat bread nor flesh, nor drank
wine, whereby he was made worthy to see many visions and revelations.

If thou will overcome thine enemy, the best way for thee is to take his
weapons away: the weapons that the devil uses against thee is thine own
proper flesh: whosoever gives him self to the pleasure and delight of the
body, will fall soon into subjection of the devil.

Dan. 14.
Daniell did first destroy the idol Bell, and after the Dragon that was
within the idol. Be thou an adversary unto the idol of the flesh, and labor
against it by abstinence, fasting, and prayer, and thou shalt carry away the
victory from the devil: nothing does fear the devil more nor makes him
faster to fly away from thee, then abstinence and austeritie of life, and
nothing does give him greater courage, nor makes him more bold to tempt thee,
then thine own flattering and overmuch fostering of thy body.

It is a very folly for thee to think that thou shall live chaste, if thou
leadest thy life in wantonness and delicasie: take away the superfluity of
thy bodily sustenance, which serves in steed of wood to make the fire
withal, and thou shalt easily quench the fire of thy sensual desires.

Loath who lived chaste in Sodom, and was thereby delivered from the fire that
consumed the City, Gene. 19.
yet after because he kept not well this virtue of temperance, but fell to
drinking of wine out of measure, he committed incest on the hill with his own
daughters. A man shall not be ouercomen by temptations, nor burnte in the fire
of sensuality, if he will defend him self with the shield of abstinence:
and although that he ascend up to the hill of contemplation, and be fled
from the world, yet if he be not abstinent, he may fall fowlie as Loath did.

It is great danger to ride a colte without a bridle. Hold him in with the
bridle of abstine^ce, lest that he do throw thee down under his feet and
mayme thee, according to the sayng of the psalm. Psalm. 31.
Keep in their jaws with the bit, and their teeth hold back with the
snaffle.

Enter not violently, into the waters of these worldly delights, unless thou will be drowned as Pharao was, Exodus 14.
and all his host with him: they descended down like stones into the bottom,
and so shall thou both soul and body descend into the bottomless pit of hell,
unless thou will tame it, and subdue the flesh with the bridle of abstinence.

Abstinence is the death of sin, the bannisher of all vice, the means to
salvation, the root of grace, and the foundation of chastity: It were a
great shame for thee to be ouerruled and maistered by thy servant.

Ismaell that was the son of the bondwoman, persecuteth the son of the free
woman. Gene. 21.
The hand maiden Agar, despises her mistres Sara, thou must afflict and
punnish thy flesh, as Sara did Agar, except thou will have it proudelie to
rebel against the spirit. Psalm. 8.


It is a foul shame for thee, being a great Prince, (whom God has not made
much inferior unto Angels) to fulfill the will of so vile a seruante as the
body is. This was the thing that Iheremy the Prophet lamented saying, Iher. 5.
the servants became Lords over their masters.

OUR EARNEST LABORING about earthly affairs, does turn away our minds
from devotion and the service of God, therefore ought we to with dravve our
selves unto quyetnes and solitarines, the better to attend the salvation of our
souls. CHAP. 19.
I will lead her up into the wilderness, Ose. 2.
and I will speak secretly to her heart says God. God has no need of any
witnesses when he speaks unto our soul.

When his will was that Abraham ^holde have the executinge of certain ^hinges
which he had appointed for him, Gene. 1^*
^e caused him first to remove out of his country, and separate him self from
the company of men.

He took Moses up unto the top of the hill Sion, and commanded that none
^hold come near unto the hill: Gene. 21.^ ^e. 19.
in the soli^arie wilderness did the Angel appear unto Agar. And Elias was
far from his own habitatio^ and the company of men, when the Angel spoke
unto him.

When God fyndeth our heart all alone, then comes he straight way to re^^ in
it: when our Lord perceyueth our soul to be sequestered from the cares of this
world, he opens and reuealeth many things unto it, which he will not do,
when he finds it occupied in the care^ and troubles of worldly business: God
is a spirit, and therefore desires not only to have the body to be solitary
and at quiet, but the soul also: this solitarines o^ mind is very necessary
for thee.

He may best be said to be alone that thinks not of things of the world*
It were good that thou did leave all these false dreams, and idle
occupations, wherein thou spendest overmuch time, and wholly commyt thy self
both body and soul, in to the hands of Jesus Christ, for then sholdest thou
find many a comfort* which now thou art without, and clea^^ depryued of. If
thou knew how much thou did loose, by the vain occupations and
worldly business, thou would not think it any pain for thee at all to
yield thy self wholly unto God alone. And if thou will put away from thee all
worldly conversation, thou shall find the most comfortable company of God him
self. Love solitarines, and thou shall preserve the grace which thou have
already received, and because thou have not forsaken thine accustomed
conversation, thou have lost the spirit, by the which thou begannest first to
serve God.

Silence and solitarines, be the two walls of devotion. If thou will keep the
devotion which thou have once conceived, thou must delight to be alone, and to
lead a solitary life. God would that our hearts should be withdrawn from all
worldly tumultes and company.

God commanded Abraham to drive out of his house Agar, and her son, Gene. 21.
which were causers of his carefulnes, to the intent, he might without all
disturba^ce of other company, enjoy the full fruition of spirit, which was
represented by Isaac his heir, and the child of promise. The woman mentioned
in the gospel, Mat. 9.
which was vexed with so many grievous infirmities, came secretly, and touched
the vesture of our Lord, and straight ways she was cured of them all. Let
every Christian soul, that is wounded and weak, draw near secretly unto
her spouse Jesus Christ, for in him shall it find perfect salvation, and very
true consolation: Thou shall sooner be cured, if thou do lift up secretly
thine heart to God almighty in a corner, then if thou go up and down all
day in the market place, and in the palaces of kings and princes.

The sweetenes of prayer, and the pleasure of a solitaire life, can hardly be
expressed with tongue.

Think not that thou art alone, for thou may say as the Prophet Elizeus
said, 4. Reg. 6.
that he being alone had yet a greater company with him, then all the great
huge army of the Sirians. And further think that thou have more with thee,
then all the world is beside, and that thou art never better accompanied, then
when thou art alone. The company of Jesus Christ, and all his holy Angels,
is no small company, and their conversation is always pleasant and comfortable.

Read the lives of the holy fathers, the heremites, and of the perfect
religious men, and thou shall find how much the love of the wilderness and
desert did shine in them. Mat. 7.
Think not thou to gather figge^ of thorns, neither do thou believe, that
living amongst the honors and vanities of this life, thou can gather the
fruy^^ and comfort of the spirit. When thou make thy prayer, enter into
thy secre^ chamber, says our Lord, and if thou finde^^ then any sweetenes of
the spirit, thou can not deny, but that thou have be^^ helped therein, by
thy solitary being^ alone, whereby thou may preceyue* how necessary
solitarines is, to furthe^ prayer withal. Thou shall not serve Go^ so much at
thine own will, as in plac^^ that be solitary, and far from all company.

It is the nature of all them that lou^ to delight in solitarines. And if thou
e^^tierlie love thy creator, thy delight will^ but small to be in the company,
of other creatures, and all worldly company, wi^^ be to thee unpleasant, if
the sweet love of Jesus Christ do rest in thine heart. Unto a spiritual
mind much company is always noisome, when thou art alone thou do often in
thy prayer, with some one word or other vterred aloude, stir up thy soul, as
if it were waked out of sleep which thou can not do, but when thou art
without company, whereby thou may judge how necessary it is for thee to be
solitary.

Our Savior did separate him self from his disciples, Mat. 26.
when he went to pray to his Father in the garden, and at many other times the
Evangelists do tell how he went alone for to pray: the conversation of many
is noisome, and therefore must thou fly from the tumulte and stir of much
people.

When Adam was alone in Paradise he was grateful to God, Gene. 1.
and to all his Angels, and fearful to the devil: but after that he was
accompanied, he lost many a ^enefite, whereof company ministered the ^ccasion.
The prophet David says: Psalm. 54.
I ^eperated my self by flying away, and I ^emayned in the wilderness.

Elias being alone was fed with bread from heaven, 3. Reg. 5. 3. Re. 17.
and being amongst a great ^ompany he cold scarce get whereof to ^ate. When
man is alone he fyndeth ^eauenly consolation, but in the compa^y of men he
loses the bread of heaven. Exodus 16.
^he Children of Israel did never eat Manna, until that they were passed the
read sea, Exodus 14.
which be the perturbations o^ this present world.

And if thou couetest much the company of men, thou may happily thereby
loose God: make not thou so little accomp^ of God, as to loose him for so small
a commodity, as the company of this world^ does yield thee.

SILENCE IS A GREAT^ keeper and maynteyner of devotion ^ religion, and
therefore, they that ob^serue it not, but are full of words, d^ make away
for the devil to h^^ them, and can by no means be perfec^ religious men.
CHAP. 20.
SILENCE is the best keep^^ of justice says Esaias. Esd. 32.
He th^^ is not a lover of silence a^^ solitarines shall never be (...) perfect
religious man.

Iam. 1.
Saint James says, th^^ whosoever thinks to be a religious ma^^ and
refraineth not his tongue, his relig^^^ will be to him but vain, and of no
effe^^ for whatsoever is gotten by prayer, is (...) again by babblinge and
much speakinge.

Silence is the best keeper and maynteyner of devotion: do not maruayle if
thou do find thy self often times, cold in thy devotions, if thou do
use to spend much time in superfluous talk and idell words. Thou must learn
to hold thy peace, if thou will look to profit, for why did God almighty
bestow on thee but one tongue and two hands, but because thou sholdest speak
little, and do much.

God has ordained for thy tongue, two doors to keep it in with, the one is of
flesh which be thy lips, the other is of harder substance and more strong,
as bone, which be thy teeth, to the intent that being so kept, it should never
speak upon any superfluous cause, but only when necessity inforceth and
gives occasion.

If thou be a busy talker, and full of words, what else art thou, but a city
without a wall, a house wiihout a door, a ship without a stearne, a vessel
without a cover, and a horse without a bridle? What have thou gotten, or what
can thou keep, if thy tongue be always looselie walkinge? And if that part
be no better guarded, the devils who are thy mortal enemies will easelie enter
into thee, and rob away from thee all the good that thou have gotten
together. Thy death and thy life, do both stand in the hands of thy tongue.
Prou 18


Holy religious men, have always highly esteemed silence, and have taken
great pains to maintain it in them, as the vearie key of religion, lest they
should have lost with much talkinge, that which they had been long about in
gettinge.

Esaias says silence and hope shall be your fortress: Es. 30.
silence gives a great grace unto all manner of virtues: Zacharias after his
long silence, received at gods hand S. John, which signifies grace. If thou
do hold thy peace and keep silence, thou shall the sooner receive the
grace of God.

As the pot that is covered will sooner be hot, and cause the liquor that is
in it the sooner to boil, the^ that which is uncovered, by reason of keepinge
in the vapors, so if thou do keep thy mouth shut up close by silence, thou
shall the sooner wa^ warm and fervent in devotion and gods service. If thou will not learn to hold thy peace, thou shall never learn how to speak.

Of the good man the scripture says thus: Thren. 3*
he will be solitary and silent, and will have regard unto him self. He that
holds his peace goes alone, and bethinketh him of his own estate, and
makes his contemplation of heavenly things, and despises the things of the
earth. He that keeps silence, with more ease does lift^ up his heart unto God.

Iam. 1.
Saint James says let every man be slow to speak, and ready to hear. They
fall quickelie from the state of perfection, that break silence, and use many
words.

Even as when you shut a conduytes mouth, where water passes, the water will
straight ways mount up on high, so if thou shuttest fast within thee the
good spirit of devotion by silence, thy prayers shall the sooner ascend up on
high unto God, and thou shall the better feel within thee, what sweet taste,
thy deuowte prayers do bring unto thee, and by as many idle words as thou
spendest, thou do as it were by so many small water streams send forth
again the devotion which thou before receyuedst. And so many doors do thou
leave open to thine enemy, that gives good watch upon thee, as thou use to
speak light words and vain.

It is written: Prou. 25.
He is like unto a city that is unwalled, that can not refrain his spirit by
keeping silence. The city of our soul must needs suffer many mortal
wounds, when it is not defended by the walls of silence.

Nabuzardam brake down and destroyed the walls of Jerusalem, 4. Re. 25.
robbed the temple, and carried the people captive to Babylon: which the devil
attempteth to do by thee, as often as he seeks to make thee break thy
silence, that so he may rob thee, and make spoil of the temple of thy
conscience, and bring thy soul prisoner into the confusion of Babilo^, which
is hell it self: Set then good watch about thy walls, lest thou be robbed and
spoiled by thine enemies.

THE GOOD SERVANTES OF Jesus Christ ought to fly idell talk^ which breeds
much danger an^ detriment to the spiritual life, and give them selves to the
contynual^ exercise of godliness and piety. CHAP. 21.
OF every idell word shall thou give a reckeninge i^ the day of judgment:
Mat. 12.
sait^ our Lord. Our heart is lik^ unto a piece of wax, tha^ with cold grows
to (...) hard, and by heat, waxes soft and tende^ again, and when it is
once soft, it receives the printe of the kings own Image* Thou must stop
thine ears, from hearin^ vain and idell words, for they cool an^ harden
thine heart. And if thou do (...) keep thy self well from hearing the^
thou shall not profit much in the seruic^ of God.

Psa. 1^4.
Holy and spiritual words inflam^ the heart according unto the saying (...)
the prophet. Thy word O Lord is fiery. In the day of Christ's resurrection,
the two disciples that went trauaylinge by the way toward Emaus, talkinge with
our Savior, had their hearts inflamed within them, as ^hey did after tell one
unto an other of them saying: Luc. 24.
Did not our hearts burn within us, whylest he talked with us upon ^he way,
and opened the scripture unto us? Thine heart will be well disposed within ^hee
to receive the printe of the image of ^he eternal King, if thou will warm it
well, and soften it with the heat of Gods own word.

With great diligence ought the seruante of God to beware of id^e words, and
to reprehend them in others that use them. And if thou have no care of that, it
is ^ut in vain for thee to account thy self among the perfect sort. And in
vain ^oest thou labor and take pain to profit ^n gods service, if thou do
not bridell well thy tongue, and order well thy words.

The Apostell says, 2. Tim. 2.
the servants of God, must not be wrangelers and conten^ious persons, nor
troublesome one to ^n other by many words. Amongst men that have had civil
bringinge up, it has ^ene taken always for a foul and a shame^ull thing, to
use dishonest and ribaulde ^peeches although they be spoken but in ^est. How
much more ought they then to ^e avoided, amongst the servants of God. ^e
circu^spect in all thy words. Let them be well weighed and considered, before
thou utter them, as it is meet for such a courtier to be* that is brought up
in the court of Jesus Christ, wherein thou live* much evil grows of
noughtie words.

The Apostle says to the Corinthians, evil words corrupt good manners. From
evil speeches men grow quickelie to evil living. 1. Cor. 15.
Many temperate men, and men of good life, by gyuing them selves first unto
idell talkinge, have fallen after by little and little, in evil doing.

As the ship goes, according as the wind does blow, so our soul sayling^
forward, with the prosperous wind o^ good speech, shall happily come unto
the port of heaven. And contrariewyse, if dissolute and wanton words shall be
blowe^ into the sails of thine ears, they wi^^ carry thy soul with a
contrary wynd^ into the large sea of the bottomless pit (...) hell.

Eccl. 9.
Ecclesiasticus says, let all thy practi^^ be to talk of the commandments
o^ God. Good words inflame the heart, stir^^ up thy will, edify thy neighbor,
and aug^^ment the love of God in thee, and idle a^^ vain words make a man
vnstedfa^^ quench the feruor of the spirit, ma^^ devotion cold, and do
scandalize a^^ offend the hearers.

Metal is known by the sounde^ gold have but an hollow sound, it is li^^
to be no perfect gold, but rather so^^ ^opper or brass: and by the sound of
the words, is the soul known. If the words ^e clamorous, vain, and
dissolute, they be ^opper and no gold, but if they be grave and wise, then do
they show them selves ^o be perfect gold.

An empty vessel makes a great and ^lowde sound, and if thou ringest loud
(...) is a sound thou art but empty. But if ^^ou be grave and prudent in thy
speeches, ^^en shall thou be known to be firm and ^f good substance.

The scripture says, 2. Mac 15
that Judas ^achabeus did arm his men with good ^ordes, and overcame with them
the migh^^e army of Nicanor. Good words be a ^^^onge defense, and idle and
lewd words (...) vearie hurtefull and prejudicial.

If the clock have his wheels dis^^mpered within, the bell without will ^unde
false, but if they go true and just ^^thin, then will the bell without, strike
^^elie the just hour of the day: By thy ^^sordinate words, thy disordered
con^^^ence appears, and is made manifest to ^^e world. By thy words, thou
art con^^mned and blamed.

The maid seruante that kept the ^^re said to S. Peter. Luc. 19. Mat. 26.
Thou art one of ^^^ile to, thy speech bewrays thee: thou ^^uest clear
testimony of thy self to be ^^^ht, (to all them that hear thee,) when thy
^^rdes are of no substance that thou ^^akest, thy tongue shows who thou art.
There is no stranger borne in a^^ country, but that his tongue will tell (...)
what nation he is. It will be but slenderl^^ believed that thou art virtuous,
althoug^ that thou affirmest it never so much t^^ self, If thy words and
talk do sound^ of dissolutenes and vanity.

He that has an ague, shall be known by his furred tongue, if the ague do^
break away, it will appear by the bre^^ king out of thy lyppes: In like
man^^^ will thy words show thee what thou ar^^ Have thou therefore great care
of the^ and beware what thou say, because the words be hard, when thy
heart is n^^ seen. By thy words thou art justified, by thy words thou art
condemned,

Be circumspect in all that thou sp^^^kest, for after they be once spoken,
(...) can not be called back again.

Consider well before hand what th^^ say, and then shall thou not be
confou^^ded and ashamed after. Never be th^^ driven, to say that thou
thoughtest not (...) it, for it is not for a wise man to say or (...) do any
thing that he thought not of b^^fore.

And to show thee breefelie how n^^cessarie it is for thee to look well to
(...) words, this may suffice, that our Lord the last day will have thee to
render a strait account of all thine idle words.

^NE OF THE GREATEST mischeefes that reigns amongst men, is murmuring, the
which spares no man, neither good nor bad, neither those that are living,
nor those that are dead, and to them that do use it, it is the cause of most
harm of all, which is the loss of heaven. CHAP. 22.
Murmr not as many of the Jews did murmr, 1 Cor. 10.
which caused their death by the biting of serpents: as the Apostle says.
The tongue of the murmurers is worse then hell, (...) hell is hurtefull only to
those which (...) naught, but the tongue of the murmu^^r hurts both good and
bad: and most (...) all it is hurtefull to them that be good ^^d virtuous.

He that snuffeth the candle with his ^^re fingers, defiles his fingers, but
the ^^ndle burns the brighter thereby: and (...) he which defameth the
virtuous and ^^st man, defiles his own soul, and hur^^th his conscience, but
he gives occasi^^ to the good man thereby of greater ^^^rite. The Pharisey
that murmured against Marie Magdalen was greatly rebuked therefore of Christ
him self, Luc. 7.
an^ contrariwise she was highly commende^ by him.

Murmurers do always much mo^^ harm unto them selves, then unto thos^ that
they murmr against: they kill their own souls, and do good to other men's.
God never gave Moses a greater praise, ^um. 12.
then at that time that Aron and Marie hi^ sister did murmr against him: they
wen^ stricken with leprosy, and Moses was se^^ forth with praise.

The murmurer never cares agayn^^ whom he murmureth, but how he may find
matter whereon to murmr, for (...) can always make matter enoughe of hi^
self.

Exodus 8.
One of the greatest plagues of Egipt^ was the frogs, and one of the great^^
mischeefes of the world is the murmu^rers: they sit like frogs all day in
the mire and uncleanness of their own sinn^^ and wickedness, and never say word
(...) any man's virtue, nor speak any things of their neighbors good deeds,
but (...) the night when it waxes dark, they mak^ a loud and an evil noise,
and do pub^lish (all that they can) their neighbors fault^ and defectes.

Prou. 22.
A good man is better then much ri^ches. He that takes a man's tempor^^^ goods
from him, only bereueth him (...) some wealth, but the murmurer takes from ^im
his good name, which is far more ^orth: and he that does murmr against ^^y
man, does more harm unto him, then ^hen he does persecute him by strong
^^nde, by so much as the goods of the ^^ule, be better then the temporal
goods ^f our body, the hands do only hurt ^^e body, but the tongue does
hurt unto ^^e soul: the hands can do no hurt to ^^em that be far of, but
the tongue spa^^th no man, neither far nor nigh: the ^^ndes do always spare
those that be ^^ade, but an evil tongue spares not e^^n those that lie buried
in their graves.

This vice is very dangerous, be^^use it is without remedy: All other ^^rmes
done unto man easily receive sa^^^faction, saving the harm that is recey^^d by
infamy: that which is taken away (...) theft from any man, may soon be
re^^red him again, but not so of a man's ^^od name impaired by an evil tongue,
(...) although that the defamer do unsay ^^t again, which he did
sclaunderouslie ^^porte before, yet is the nature of man so ^^ch the more
inclined to hear evil the^ ^^od, that the first evil conceived opi^^^, will
not be so rooted out of the mind, (...) that there will some what thereof
re^^yne behind still. All evil is so highly ^eleued, that what good soever
is after ^^ported of him that was before defamed, ^^l scarce ever get any
sufficient credit.

The prophet says: Psa. 139.
Their tongues were sharp as any adders, and the poyso^ of serpents was under
their lips. The^ eat of the earth as serpents do, for the^ do always
maintain their poison (...) the very basest and vilest things that the^ can
espy in their neighbors.

Dan. 2.
The stone that fell from the hill, which Daniell speaks of, struck the image
o^ king Nabucodonozer in the feet, which were made of claye, it never lighted
o^ the head which was made of gold, no^ the arms which were of silver, but
on the feet which were made of earth, where^unto the murmurer may be well
resem^bled, for he never finds matter to talk^ of, but of his neighbors
defectes, and n^uer will speak word of any virtue, o^ good gift that is in
any of them.

Psalm. 33.
The prophet David asked this question, saying: What man is he that wold^ have
life, and desires to see good daye^* And because that all men desired it, the
prophet says immediately in the ne^^ verse following: Keep thy tongue from
speaking evil, and let not thy mouth vt^^^ any falsehoode.

God made not thy tongue of bone* nor of any orher hard substance, but (...)
tender flesh, because thy words should b^ tender and sweet, and not roughe
no^ sharp.

God did so sharply correct the murmurers, Number. 14.
that he said unto Moses: No^^ of you that have murmured against me i^ ^^e
des^rt, shall ever enter into the land ^f promise. And so of six hundredth
thou^^nd of them which came out of Egypt, ^^eir entered into the land of
promise, but ^nlie two persons: But into our land of ^romyse which is heaven,
there shall not ^he murmurer enter at all.

^VHERE THERE IS MVCH curiosity used of inquiring after other men's doings,
there will never be good rest nor quietness, and of curiosity does murmuringe
grovve, and despisinge of our neighbor, and the curious person is of all men
ever misliked. CHAP. 23.
MY virtue had forsaken me, and the light of mine eyes is not with me, says
David. Psalm. 37.
He says not here, that he had lost his eye sight, but that the light of ^^s
eyes was not with him, for that he had (...) them abroad far of to see what
other ^^en did. If thou have any desire to profit in ^^e service of God, thou
must take great ^eede, that thou make not two earnest ^^quirie after other
men's doings.

And if thou desire to live quietly and contentedlie, be not two curious
(...) inquisitor after the lives and deeds (...) others. Thou shall never have
peace (...) mind, nor tranquillity of heart, if the^^ do give thy self to
behold and (...) mark the lives of thy neighbors. And (...) thou look not
well to the auoydinge (...) this fault, thou will be evil thought (...) of
all men. Therefore as soon as the Pro^phet had said, that the light of his
ey^^ was not with him, he said by and by after in the same Psalm: My friends
and (...) neighbors did separate them selves fa^^ of from me. And that for
very great cause, and of good reason, for he that me^^^leth, and is busy in
other men's matters, (...) evil thought of, and hated of all folk^^ And his
vearie friends and kinsfolk w^^ utterly forsake him. Of this fault (...)
murmuringe grow, hereof comes prid^ for he despises others, and knows
(...) him self.

The river that ouerfloweth his acc^^stomed bounds, does wash the banc^^ that
it beats against, whereby the ba^c^^ be made more clean, and the water th^^
washed them is made more foul and filthi^ And even so is it by thee, when thou
go^ beyond thine own bounds, in meddli^^ with other men's matters wherewith
the^ haste nothing to do, thou do de^^ thine own consciene, and gyuest
th^^ occasion thereby of amendmente, in (...) much as they grow more wary and
advise ^y thy words: they do gain by thy ad^ertisments, and do merit by
patiente ^^ffring of thy injuries, where thou with (...) troubled stream of a
polluted consci^nce, runnest on still in thy furious course.

It is a great error in any man to in^^rmeddle him self with those things
that appertain not unto him: Art thou ^ither Judge or magistrate, that the
charge ^^ereof belongs unto thee? we must all ^^ake our reckening to God
almighty of ^ur own works, but not of other men's. ^here is no marchante but
will leave his ^^ade, if he perceive that he be a looser ^^ereby: and thou
can no way apply thy ^^lfe to any trade, that thou shalt either ^^yne less,
or loose more, then by med^^^ng with the lives and delinges of other ^^^en,
which be not of thy charge: leave of ^^d forsake so evil and so unprofitable a
^^ade as soon as thou can.

Happily thou haste need of so little ^^me to be bestowed upon thy self, that
^^ou have enough in store to bestow on ^^her men: have thou so little to do,
as ^^at thou can mark and consider what ^^her men do? In this short course
of ^^y life, and in so great an account (...) thou have to make, it is half
a marvel, ^^ow thou can find time to busy thy self ^^oute the lives and
doings of other ^en.

He that neither cares for his own ^^ule, nor takes regard of his
conscience, may well be at leisure to attend what other men do. And in deed
there are lightly none that more looks into other men's lives, then they that
make small account of their own, and there is none that will be more severe in
the examyninge of other men's doings, then they that be most licentious in
their own.

There is none so much offended at small faults of other men, as they that
commit great faults of their own. And finally no man judges so evil of
his neighbors, as he that lives most looseli^ him self.

Eccl. 29.
The wise man says, He is in miserable estate, that goes from house to house.
When the master keeps at home in hi^ own house, all that be in the house
do^^ their duties there, but when he is go^^ from home, they do what they
will, and take their pleasure. When reason keeps the house, and enters into
her own conscience, then be all the thoughts set (...) good order, all the
senses and affections be placed as they ought to be, but if that she^^ go
forth of the doors, and goes wandering abroad from house to house prying what
others do abroad, that while, be all the thoughts of the mind idelly
occupied, (...) no good done at all.

Gene. 25.
Esau went abroad in the fields and Jacob still bode at home in the house, for
it is the property of all good folks (...) keep at home in their own
consciences but the idle loyterer still wandreth abroad, perusing what other
do. Be thou no examyner of other men's lives, neither do thou as the poor
needy tailor does, that makes a garment for an other man, and goes him self
naked. And if thy neighbor be naught, he must give account thereof unto God.

Thou shall find for thy self enough to do, if thou will enter into thy
self, consider well thine own life. But thou do busy thy self to much
about many things as Martha did, L^c. 10.
and because thou medlest with many, thou art much troubled. But one, is
necessary for thee, this one is God him self, deal thou with him only, and
meddle not with to many matters, if thou do entend to lead a quiet and a
contented life.

If thou will taste of the inward comfort of the spirit, thou must mislike
with these outward and external business of the world: And thou must first
despise these worldly offices and dignities, which worldly men do seek
after, if thou will feel how sweet and comfortable the conversation of Jesus
Christ is.

There needs no witnesses to prove against the, that thou bear no love unto
God, if thou do occupy thy self about superfluous cares, and art a busy
examiner of thy neighbors lives, be ready to help them, in all that they
have need of, and to succor them as thou art able, and never meddle further
with the^, nor seek to know more of them. Love them all and eschew all
further busy doings with them, and then will God love thee, and all men will
esteem of thee, and so shall thou live in good quietness and contentement here
in the world.

THOU MVST NOT BE A rash and a rigorous judge of thy neighbors deeds, but
patiently bear with them, and take them all to the best, and if any amongst
them be lewd, yet despise thou him not, cast him not of, for thou know not
what shall be the end of him. CHAP. 24.
Gal. 6.
LET every man bear one another burden, says the Apostle. And thou may
well bear with thy neighbor a few things, when God bears with thee so
many. Be not thou a cause of offense unto thy neighbor, nor do not thou
lightly reprehend him for every small offense: thou have enough to do for thy
self, without intermedlinge much with thy neigh^ours matters.

If thou find not all folks conformable to thy mind in all points, yet
must ^ot thou be troublesome or grievous to them in reprehending them, and
findinge fault with them. For albeit that thou art good and virtuous of thy
self, yet may an other be as good and as virtuous as thou ^rte, and yet not in
all points be like unto ^hee. If thou do perceive any imperfections in thy
neighbors, yet ought ^hou to think that under them be many good virtues
hidden, which thou know not of, for thou art not a God that knows all
things. And many good works do men unknown to thee. Condemn not thy
neighbor, neither be thou angry with him, but call to thine own memory,
thine own weakness, and thine own sins, and ever interpret thy neighbors
deeds unto the best. And when thou can not excuse the deed it self, yet
interpret favorably of the inte^tio^ of the deed, which perhaps may be good,
or else if any fault were committed, it was of ignorance. And when no reason
will allow thee to give any excuse, neither of the deed, nor of the intent
thereof, but that thy neighbor did trespass in the doing it, yet ought ^hou
to think, that he was vehemently tempted to the doing of it, and that if thy
self had been assaulted with so great temptation, thou sholdest have done
much worse. And give thanks unto God that thou escapedst the like temptation,
and with tender compassion, make thine earnest prayer unto God for thy
neighbou^ that fell.

1. Cor. 10.
The Apostle says: Let him that stands take heed that he fall not. If th^^
will be rigorous, and a rash judge of other men's faults, God will suffer
thee (...) fall into the same faults that thou co^demnest thy poor brother
for, and happily into some greater fault to, for the taming and subduing of
thy pride.

Mat. 26.
S. Peter thinking him self to ha^^ a better courage then any of his felowe^
had, shortly after had a foul fall. Thank^ God that he has vpholden thee with
hi^ own hand: true perfect holiness neue^ falls into disdain, but into
compassion*

The good and just man, has compassi^on upon the sinner, and knows that h^
may err as well as the other did. If thou be learned or wise, or have any
other go^^ gift or grace, that others do want, do n^^ thou take any pride
thereof, neither despise thou others that have them not, b^^ rather reprehend
and find fault with the self, that having received more at God^ hands then
others have, yet thou serue^ him and obeyest him less then they do* If the
favors and the commodities, and a^^ those good inspirations which God hat^
given unto thee, to make thee for to ser^^ him, had been given by him unto the
thieves and murderers that go wande^ringe about the world, they would
neither have robbed nor have murdered, but would happily have served God much
better then thou do serve him: and because that God has been good unto
thee, thou must not be evil unto an other: have always an humble opinion of
thy self, and thou shalt receive greater favor and more abundant grace at
Gods hand.

If thy brother do offend thee, thou must receive him again with mercy and
with charity, according to the saying of the Apostle: Gal. 6.
Brethren if any of you shall be taken in any offense, you that be spiritual
instruct you him amongst you, by the spirit of meekenes, considering that any
of you may also be tempted.

Consider thy self says S. Paul, for if thou would consider thy self,
and have respect unto thy own faults, thou would never be proud, nor
reprehend thy neighbor with any great indignation. And when thou have cause
to chasten any that is under thee, look that thou do it with piety. When
thou offendest? would thou that God should straighte ways send thee down
into hell? And if thou will that God shall deal mercifully with thee, then
must thou deal mercifully also with thy neighbors. And he that will chastise
other men's offenses with rigor and severity shall never deserve to have his
own offenses pardoned at gods hand.

And if a man be never so bade, yet ought thou not clean to cast him of,
because thou know not, what the end of that man may be, for he that is bad
(...) day, may to morrow amend and be better. Who would have thought, that the
thief that spent all his life time in robbinge and stealing, Luc. 23.
should have made so good an end, as that he should have been brought by our
Savior him self into perpetual glory? If any man had slain him, one year
before, he had bereued him of that happy end of his. How many great sinners
have there been in the world, that have been afterward blessed Saints.

No man ought to be utterly cast away, though he be never so great a sinner,
for because he may be a Saint at the last. Es. 59.
The hand of God is not shortened, thou must not give any bounds or limits
unto his graces, nor measure his mercies. Those happily that thou see now
to have committed great crimes, God may choose to make his predestinates and
elects of: What shall become of men in time to come, that can not thou
know: that which thou know, is that thou art thy self a sinner, and that
thou art worthy to be despised of all men, and to be condemned to hell. If
thy neighbor do offend, take thou heed, 1 Cor. 12.
says the Apostle for we be all members one of another.

It is conformable to the law of nature, and to all common reason, that one
member should help and succor another. Despise not thine own flesh, suffer
with patience thy brothers offenses and never be thou scandalized or offended
thereat, but continue in thy good exercyses of prayer and contemplation,
whatsoever or how much soever thou see amiss in other men. For the sorrow
and the passion that thou do often receive by these occasions, does cool
thy soul, and takes away the ferue^cie of thy spirit, and much harm does
the grief that grows of these exterior things, unto the seruante of God.

Except thou do discharge thy mind of these vain cares, and keep it from
wandringe abroad, thou shall not much profit. But enter within thy self and
have always in thy memory that thou art a sinner, and stand in fear and
suspicion of thy self, for thou know not whether thou art acceptable unto
God or no, neither if thou were, how long thou shalt continue in the good
course that thou have begone.

AS SOON AS ANY Wicked thoughts do approach unto thy mind, they must
straight vvayes be driven away and extynguished, for though they be never so
small at the first, yet if they do continue, they will grovve greater, and
wax stronger, whereby they will be able to dravve thee into destruction.
CHAP. 25.
Mich. 2.
VVOE be unto you tha^ think upon things unprofitable, Heb. 4.
says God. Thy thoughts must not be idle, nor occupied about any evil
thing, for even of the very thoughts shall thou be asked a reckeninge in the
latter day. If men should bu^ behold the vanity of thy cogitations, i^ what
credit do thou think that they would have thee? And yet thou knowe^^* that
at the day of judgment the secrete^ of all hearts shall be laid open.

It will be a wonderful confusion an^ shame unto thee, when all thy secre^
thoughts shall be made manifest unto the whole world, whereof thou art no^
ashamed to let thy cheifest and most secret friends to know any thing. If
thou do let evil thoughts harbor any while within thee, thou can not
escape, but that thou shalt thereby fall into the danger of death.

Of thoughts first come words, and after of words follow deeds: Such corn
as thou put into the mill, such meal shall thou have thence again: thine
imagination goes always about like the wheel of a mill, and if thou do
put into it good thoughts, it will yield thee meal again of good works: but
if thou do put into it evil thoughts, conformable unto them shall thy
works be also: Of barley corn will never good meal come, neither of idle
thoughts will ever come good deeds.

He that tarieth long in any evil thought, puts him self into danger
of consenting unto it. The psalm says: Happy is he that takes the little
children, Ps^. 13
and throws them against the stone. And before that thy thoughts do grow
to any greatness, beat them against that rock, which S. Paul speaks of. The
rock (says he) is Christ. 1. Cor.
And if they be agreeable unto his law, let them grow and increase, but if
they be not, do them away betyme, according to his commandment. Kill thine
enemy when he is but young and little, for if thou let him grow until he be
great, he will go near to kill thee.

It is a wise man's part to stand in some fear of his enemy, although he be
yet but little: Thy thoughts be like unto the root of a tree, if it be green
it is good, and will cause the tree to bring forth fruit, but if it be dry
and withered, it will bring forth no fruit at all. If the thought be good, it
ministers good matter unto the will to take hold of, which being mayntayned
and helped forward with the intelligence, does bring forth good desires, from
which good works do proceed.

In evil thoughts thou must not abide, for of this did God by the mouth of
Jeremy the prophet complain saying. How long will this people continue in
their evil thoughts? Iher. 4.
God does not here find fault with them for that they had evil thoughts,
but because they perseuered and continued in them.

When the gentiles remained amongst the people of Israel, God did clean
forsake his people, and would not once vouchsafe to speak unto them: and so
shall thou be also forsaken of him, if thou will let evil thoughts take up
their dwellinge with thee, God is with thee, when evil thoughts be away from
thee, but when they come once in place, he departs quyte away from thy soul.
Thou must shut the door of thy consent against them, that they may have no
restinge place with thee.

It was lawful for the Jews, to let the gentiles pass through their
country, for thereof would no harm come unto them, if they passed by like
strangers: but the fault is only in sufferinge them to tarry and abide
there. Let them pass by hardly, but in no wise give them time to harbor with
thee. When a little spark of an evil thought, does catch hold in thy mind
thou must not blow on it, to kyndell it withal, left it grow unto a fire,
that may after burn thy soul everlastingly in hell.

The silk worms be at the first certain little graynes, like unto Mustard
seed, and by the caryinge of them about in wemens boosoms, they gather an
heat, by which heat, they get life. And so do those little graynes, come at
last to be woormes. Beware that thou do not likewise sow certain seeds of
sensuality in thy corrupted imagination, which by the heat that they do take
within thy breast, the woorme may get life, and after byte and gnawe thy
conscience. That woorme is it of which the Prophet Esaias speaks saying, their
woorme shall never die. Esa. 66.


Nourish not thine evil thoughts with the heat of worldly love, nor let not
thy consent yield unto them, lest thou be deceived, and so perish everlastingly.

IDLENESS DOES CAUSE in man dishonest thoughts, and opens the gate unto all
vice, but the good exercise of virtues, does shut up the way of temptation,
that the devil can not get in. CHAP. 26.
Eccl. 33.
MVch evil has idleness taugh* (says the wise man.) Above all things fly
idleness, the very mother of vice, and the stepmother of all virtue. It (...)
nothing in deed, but a vearie death, and the sepulcher of a man that i^ yet
living.

If God would, that man which wa^ created in original justice and indewed with
so many good gifts of perfection should not live idlelie, thou that lyue^ now
so compassed about with so many enemies, how much have thou cause (...) avoid
it, and to fly away from it.

God placed Adam in Paradise, to the end that he should labor and work there*
and yet he for all his labor and trauaille sustained great loss and harm,
and think thou to gain by living at thy^^ own will and pleasure? (...) 5.
Job says that man ^s borne to travail, as the bird is to fly, and
therefore God has given thee two ^andes to work withal, as he has given ^he
bird two wings to fly withal.

He that goes about to shoot at any bird, will not shoot at him when he
^ieth, but will tarry and expect until he ^tand still. So the devil will
never seek ^o shoot at thee, or hurt thee, when thou ^rte occupied, but
wayteth the time until that he may find thee idle, that he may ^hen strike
thee, with his temptations, and ^ake from thee the life of thy soul.

Thou must therefore always be oc^upied, that the devil may never find ^hee
idle. The vessel that is occupied and ^ull already, can contain no more in
it: and ^he mind that is full occupied about ^ood things, cannot admit any
evil ^houghts into it. But if the devil do find (...) unoccupied, he will
put what mischief ^^e list into it.

The water which contynuallie run^eth, brings forth good fish, but the
^^andinge waters, as marrishes and lakes, ^^oe bring forth frogs, and
serpents, and ^^at fish that is in them is unsavory and ^aungerous to eat
of: And what can ^^ou bring forth, if thou be idle, but foul and dishonest
thoughts.

Drive away from thee all idleness, ^or if thou fliest not away from this
plague, ^^ou canste not choose but be taken pri^^ner by a number of vices.

1. Re. 19. 2. Re. 11. 3. Re. 11.
When David was kept occupied with the continual persecutions of Saul, he
fell not into sin, as he did afterward when he was idle at home in his ow^e
pallaice. And Solomon when he was occupied about his buyldinges, offended not
God, but when his work was all at end, and that he gave him self unto
idleness, he committed great offenses.

Iud. 18.
The sons of Dan destroyed the city of Lachis, because the people thereof
were idle and given to slowthfullnes.

Idleness is the nourisher of all carnal vices: If thou will fly from
idleness* thou shalt soon make all sin and vy^^ to famish in thee, for
thereby thou take^^ away all the sustenance that mayntayne^^ it. Sap. 10.
God brought the just man through the right way, and adorned him with trauayl^
said the wise man. The way to heaven i^ full of travail and continual
occupations of holiness and virtuous exercyses.

If thou did but remember, that o^ all the time which thou do loose, th^^
must render a strayte reckening to almigh^tie God, thou would not loose one
io^^ thereof: the spirit of God does shewe^^ self where it is, for it will
suffer no idl^^nes to rest where it remains.

Prou. 31.
Of an holy soul it is written: He di^ not eat his bread in idleness. When
th^^ art idle, thou do loose the best thi^^ which thou have, which is
time..

Exodus 16.
Gather thy Manna together in the ^^ue of the Sabbath, that thou may rest
^hen the Sabbath day comes, that is to ^^y, take pains and travail whilst
thou ^^te in this life, that thou may rest and ^^ke thine ease, when that
great feast of ^^ernall bliss comes.

The slothful man will take no pains (...) cold weather, Eccl. 16.
he will therefore beg ^^en summer comes. If thou will let this ^^fe pass
away in idleness, thou shall starve ^^r famyne, and be cast away into the fire
(...) hell.

The idle persons that would not work ^^re reprehended in the Gospel. Mat. 20.
The ^^de that lies idle and is not manured, ^^ingeth forth thistles and
thorns: and if ^^ou do not take heed of idleness, thou ^^st not choose but
that thy heart will be ^^l of evil thoughts. VVhylest thou ly^^st (says the
Apostle) labor to live well. Gal. 5.
^^ame not (says Jesus Christ) to call thee ^^to pleasures, but for to labor
and take ^^yne.

Occupy the land of thine heart in ^^od and holy exercyses, to the intent that
thou may do good works, and bring forth the fruits of well deserving.

OUR LORD GOD MAKES greater account of the feruor of spir^^ vvherevvith he is
served, then of l^^^ service slackelie and slovvlie performed, and therefore
all good vvork^ ought to be done with feruor of spiri^^ CHAP. 27.
Romans 12.
SERVE our Lord (says the Apostle) in feruencie of the spirit, with all
carefullne^^ and beware of slowth. Go^ would have us to be fer^^^ in all our
good deeds: (...) hour of feruente devotion does plea^^ God more, then an
hundred hours spe^^ in the slow and slack serving of hi^ God makes more
account of the ^^^^uencie of the spirit, then of the length^^ the time.

Thou may in short time me^^^ much, and in a long space merit ve^^ little
before God. The thief that (...) hang on the cross, served God, but a lit^^^
space, but in that little time he meri^ much.

Luc. 23.
The father which the gospel mak^ mention of representinge God him se^^^ when
he received again his prodig^ ^^nne made a great solemn feast for joy
^^ereof, in so much that his elder son ^^s angry at it, and compleyned to
his ^^ther, saying that he had never done so ^uch for him, having served him
always ^^ithfully and obedientlie. The father did ^^stlie make so great a
feast at his sons ^^turnynge, for that after his conversion (...) served him
with that fervent and ear^^st affection of heart, that in a short space (...)
merited more, then his other son did, ^^th all his long cold and slow
service (...) many years.

Many young men that are entered in^^ religion, will often merit more in a
^^orte space, then many old and ancient ^^en in much longer time: thou must
not ^eade unto God thy long and thy aunciente ^^^uice done unto him, as that
good son ^^d unto his father, who recorded unto ^^m all that faithful and
obedient service ^^at he had done many years, for it may be, ^^at he which came
to serve him but yes^^^day, may be more acceptable unto him, ^^en he which had
bestowed many years ^his service before: for God makes no ^^compte of the
time, but he esteems of ^^e spirit and feruor of mind.

He that serves God but coldely, is ^^ry near departing from him by sin.
^^^d says: I would thou were either ^^de or whote, Apo. 3.
but because thou art but ^^ke warm, I must vomit thee out of my ^^uth. Of
warmenes there be two kinds, one which goes from heat unto cold^ which is
naught, and the other which forsakes the cold, and draws toward heat,
which is good.

He that has been naught, and b^^ginneth to draw near unto God, ough^ not
to be reprehended for his warme^^ but rather commended, because he is c^^ming
toward heat: but he that once wa^ hoate, and now begins to wax lu^^
warm, he is very reprehensible, and (...) need of good advise and help, for
(...) declineth a pace toward the coldness (...) sin. This is that luke
warmenes, whi^^ God almighty reprehendeth, and that (...) very great reason,
for it is not meet the thou sholdest serve him, or seek af^^ him, with any
lukewarm love or affecti^^ that served and sought the out with (...) great
feruencie of love, and veheme^^ affection.

Io. 13.
He bad Judas the traitor at his la^^ supper to make have with that which (...)
went about, as he that had an earnest d^^sire to die for us all. And thou
may (...) ashamed to serve that master, with any (...) or slow affection,
that with so fervent spirit would suffer death for thy sake. It is vea^^^
convenient, that thou sholdest unto such master as this is, offer all the
service th^^ thou can with most earnest and burning love toward him.

Luc. 1.
The glorious virgin mother unto o^^ Savior was vearie careful to visit.
(...) ^^izabeth in which act of hers, thou art (...) consider the feruor of
her tender love ^^d affection.

God commanded that the paschall ^^n be should be eaten by the Jews in have,
Exodus 12.
^^cause he would have us to be quick and ^^^igent in doing of all good
deeds, and ^^at in the serving of him we should not (...) slack nor slow.

Abraham ran in have to receive the ^^^lie Angels that came unto him, Gene.
18.
and for (...) do them service.

If thou sholdest by promise receive ^reate some of money, after thou had
^^rformed such a journey, as should be ^^pointed thee, thou would run a
^^ce, and never make stay in any place (...) the way. And thou must remember,
that ^^ou have a great journey to make, and (...) time of thy life is but
short. And the ^^y somewhat long. Thy reward that is ^^^mised thee, being so
great, and thy ^^^e of life here so short, it behooves ^^^e to go no slow
pace, nor to serve ^^^d with any dull affection.

It were well for thee that thou did ^^ceede swiftelie in thy course, so as
^^^u might say with the Prophet. I have ^^ne (O Lord) the way of thy
precepts. Psa. 118.
^^at good holy king went not forward ^he way of God slowlye as thou do,
(...) served him after any dull manner, as ^^^u seruest him: thou ought to
make ^he have thou can, in doing of all good deeds, so as if thou hadest not
one hour^ to live.

A cunning Doctor of Physic, reaso^ning of his art unto his disciples, told^
them: The life is short, the art is long and the experience is deceyuable:
but (...) told them not this, because that his scollers should not study
physic, but because they should study it the more earnestly and bind them
selves to it, with the grea^ter attention, since the life is but shor^^ and the
science difficulte: So ought thou to be very diligente and careful to serve
God, because that the life is short, and there is much work for thee to be
done.

BEFORE THAT ANY MAN does bend him self tovvarde any work that apperteyneth
to his salvation, it is good for him to consider the quality of the enterprise
that he takes in hand, and his own force in performynge it, lest he should
inconsideratelie begin a thing, that he cold not go through vvithall. CHAP.
28.
Believe not every spirit, but prove first whether the spirit be of God or
no: 1. Io. 4.
says S. John the Apostle. Before that thou do resolve thy self upon any
thing, consi^er first the work, and what thou art ^^le to do in it, and do
not adventure ^^y se^fe blindlie, before thou know that thou can do.

Many begin a work with great ^^ruor and little discretion, and in the end
^^ose all their labor, for when they should ^^ing it to perfection, they have
faynted, ^^^d then have repented them, that ever ^^ey began therewithal.

Look first whether thou be able, to persevere in that thou go about, for
God favors not those works that an^ begone without wisdom and good
dis^cretion.

Job. 20.
S. Marie Magdalene continued sti^^ at the sepulcher of our Savior with gre^^
earnest love and devotion, and yet wold^ not Christ vowchesafe to let her touc^
him. after he had appeared unto her: b^^ S. Thomas that was incredulous he
co^^maunded to touch him.

Thou do happily think the Christ did against justice in this that (...)
should show favor unto the vnbeleeuin^ disciple, and refuse his most louinge
an^ obedient seruante and scholar. But no^ the reason, God misliketh
inconsidera^^^ and unadvised deeds. S. Thomas say^^ that he would beeleue that
he was rise^ he might touch him, and in this opini^^^ he continued firmly,
eight days tog^^ther, for the which he found the be^^ favor at Christ's
hand: but Marie Ma^^dalene as soon as she saw our Saui^^ after that he was
risen she sodeynlie ^^^uentured for to touch him, without c^^^sideration at
all, and therefore she (...) worthelie put back for her haste. G^^ would not
have us lightelie to determ^^^ any great enterprise, but that we sh^^^ with
good consideration and disc^^^ first bethink us well thereof, and (...) after
execute it.

The blessed virgin Mary, mother of ^ur Savior, being saluted by the Angel,
Luc. 1.
^ethought her well first, what the salutati^^ should be, and wisely considered
of it, before that she would determine to set own her resolution, and give
answer (...) that most holy imbassage.

If thou do not consider with pru^^nce before hand, thou must needs ^^nne
blindly in the dark, and then with ^^e greater force that thou runnest, in the
^^eater danger thou art: and if thou be ^^uowte and fervent, then have thou
the ^^re need of wisdom to direct it by. It written of the Jews, that they
were a ^^ople without council, Deu. 32.
and without ^^sdome.

David in gyuinge to light credit the false reports of Siba, 2 Re. 19.
gave an unjust ^^^tence against Miphiboseth, which fault ^^^ers Princes and
great men do fall ^^o, by believing over lightly that which ^^old them,
whereby many honest men ^^vnd one, before their cause be heard, (...) many a
poor man suffers extreme ^^onge, before he know who were cau^^^ of his
harm.

Nathan the Prophet erred, when he ^^^e unadvised counsel unto David to ^^^ld
the temple, 2. Reg. 7.
never consulting there^^ before with God almighty.

Our Savior being chosen to be ^^^ge in the cause of the adulteress, Io. 8.
su^^^nded his judgment, for a while, writing first with his finger in the
earth.

God would not have us to give se^^tence, Exodus 19.
without that we do first look^ well upon the matter, and as it were feel it
with our fingers. When Moses w^^ was the friend of God, had heard the
l^^mentations and complaints of the people he referred the matter first unto
God, a^^ then gave answer him self unto the people after.

Believe not lightly, for he that light of credit is light of mind also*
thou be rash and hasty upon the sodeyn^^ thou will be sorry and repent thee at
leysu^^ Move not after every wind, Eccl. 5. Ephesians. 5.
nor go a^^ter every way. The Apostle says: VVa^ warely and not like fools,
but like (...) and ware men, least you fall into daung^^*

Our Lord said unto his discipl^ I have given you all an example, Io. 13.
that (...) have done this work of humility* should you also do the same:
That (...) that him self took in doing well, (...) would he that they should
learn to do him, for even the work that is moral^ good of his own nature
may be made (...) profitable through want of wisdom (...) discrete orderinge.
Thou must learn (...) Jesus Christ the way to work well (...) thou will have
thy works to be acc^^^table unto him.

Gene. 22.
Abraham is commended in script^^ because he did that which God co^^maunded him,
with consideration (...) judgment. God commanded him to sa^rifice his son,
and he for the better ^erforming of that which was commaun^ed him, took him
away with him at ^ydnight, lest his wife should have inter^upted him, and left
his servants at the ^ill foot, because he would have no im^ediment given him,
in the fulfillinge of ^ods commandment. If he had at the first, when he
received the commaunde^ent, told how he went for to sacrifice ^ym, he had
been like to have received ^any impedimentes, and scarce should he ^aue been
able without great danger to ^aue performed that, which God had commanded
him. But he so wisely and consideratelie handeled every thing that perteyned
unto that matter, that gods commandment should have taken effect, if God by
his holy Angel, hade not made ^tay thereof him self.

In all the service that perteyneth unto God, he looks for a discreet, and
an ^duysed consideration in the orderinge thereof. For although that the meat
be never so good, yet may it not be well eaten of, before that it be seasoned,
as is needful for it. And God will not receive thy service, unless thou
do season it with the salt of a good conscience, and discreet usage.

THE FEAR OF GOD drives away from man, all kind of other fear, and makes
him bold against all force of man: but he that fears not God, does stand in
fear of every thing. CHAP. 29.
Psalm. 2.
SERVE God in fear, and rejoice in him with trembling. (says the prophet
David.) He that fears God fears nothing beside him, and he that fears
not God is afraid of all things.

Cain, when he had lost the fear of God, became so weak hearted, and so
timorous, Gene. 4.
that he said. Every body that meets with me, will kill me. He that was of
so great courage, that he durst kill his own brother, suddenly became so very
a cowarde, that he stood in fear of every thing: Marueyle thou not hereof at
all, because he that has lost the fear of God, which gave him strength, must
needs become weak hearted and fear every thing: but contrarywyse, he that
fears God is valiante, and beside him fears nothing.

This fear of God imboldened Moses to go unto king Pharao, Exodus 5.
and boldly ^o bid him, to let the children of Israel ^epa^te away from him.

Elias feared God, and that made him ^olde to say unto king Achab. ^. Re 1^.
4. Reg. 3.
Thou have ^roubled all Israel, because thou have for^aken God, and followed
Baalam.

The auctoritye was great where^ith Elizeus reprehe^ded Ioram, Act. 4.
but much ^reater was that, wherewith S. Peter did ^^eake in the counsel of
the Jews. ^Vhat wonderful stout answers did the ^oly Apostles and Martirs
give unto prin^es and kings.

If thou do fear God, thou need ^ot to fear any man: he is more mighty
that defends thee, then he that does ^ersecute thee, how mighty soever he
be* because that thou want the fear of God, thou art afraid of men, and
every ^^all infirmity makes thee to tremble.

The king that goes warded with ^is guarde of armed men about him, ^andeth
in no fear, and other meaner ^en also live without fear, that go well ^rmed
in the company of valiante men. and how should these men then be affrayed, ^^at
have God for their safegarde? And if ^^e force of a guarde, does keep men
without fear: how should they be affrayed, ^^at have God for their shield and
defense.

Holy David says, Psalm. 26.
God is the pro^^ctor of my life, of whom should I then (...) affrayed, God is
my light and my salua^^on, of whom then shall I stand in awe.

Prou. 18.
The wise man says, the wicked man flies away, when no man persecuteth him,
but the just man is bold like a lion. As the worldly men that do evil, do
live full of fear and suspicion, so do good men put their trust in God, and
are bold like lions, and stand not in any fear of men.

He that fears God, never fears any man. Thou shall have much good (says
Toby to his son) if thou will fear God. To. 4.
If thou do not sustain thy self with the fear of God, all thy buyldinge
will soon go to the ground. The fear of God helps us well, to make little
account of the goods of this world.

The marchante through the fear which he has of loosinge his life, is
content to throw his goods which he so much esteems into the sea. And if
thou fear God, thou will easelie despise the goods of the earth, for the
saving of the life of thy soul.

It is great folly to live without the fear of God, living amongst so
many dangers as the Apostle makes mention of in his Epistle to the
Corithians.

WE MVST BE OBEDIENT unto the commandments of God, without any great
seekinge to know the causes of them, we must also be content to yield our
obedience to our superiors, although they be in diverse respects inferior
unto us, folovvinge the example of our Savior, who was obedient for us unto
the death. CHAP. 30.
Who is this, Mat. 8.
unto whom both sea and wyndes be obediente? Said certain sailors that talked
of Jesus Christ. Here art thou taught ^o be obedient unto him, unto whom the
^nsensible creatures be obediente: It is maruayle that man should not
willingly obey him, whom the seas and wyndes obey.

The greatest sign of true mortification, is obedience: the greatest
despisinge of the world is this, to be ready for Christ ^o forsake wholly thine
own will, it is the best thing that thou can give unto him.

Thou must not think much to be sub^ecte unto any body that is set o^e^ thee,
for the love of Christ, seeing it is written of him self: Luc. 2.
That he was subject unto Joseph, and to his Mother.

Think not the yoke of obedience to be any great burden, Phil. 2.
when the Son of God him self was obediente unto death.

If thou do but consider how much more mighty Christ was, then they unto
whom he did obey, thou will not think it an hard thing for thee to obey them
that be meaner then thy self. But because thou think not of these things
therefore thou art grieved to be obedient unto one that knows less then thy
self, yet in deed it is nothing for thee, being but a man: to obey another
man for gods sake, when God him self became obedient unto man for thy sake.

If it seem a sharp thing unto thee, to obey him that is appointed ruler over
thee, yet the love of God will convert all that sharpenes into sweetenes: If
thou do but annoynte the hook of the door with a little oil, when (...)
makes a noise in the opening and shutting, it would go easily, and make no
noise at all: and i^ thou do murmr and grudge against thy governor,
annoynte thine heart with the holy Oil of Gods love, and thou will be well
contented in silence and with all sweetness of spirit to do all that shall be
commanded thee.

Luc. 10.
God says to his holy Prelates. He that hears you, hears me, and he that
despises you, despises me, and he that despises me, despises him that sent
me. So as the prelate is here in Gods place, and that which he commands
thee, God commands thee also, if it be not repugnant unto Gods law, thou
must re^erence God in him: and although that ^he person be many times bad, yet
is his office and calling holy.

David honored Saul, 1. Re. 24
because he was ^is king, and governor, although he knew ^im to be naught and
rejected of God. God struck the heart of David with some ^ompunction, when he
had done no more ^ut cut a piece of his garment away. How (...) it like that
they shall escape the chase^^sement of God, that do rent all their ^ulers
garments in pieces, by their open murmuring and repining at them, when ^hey be
as Saul was, sinners? Recommend ^^y ruler unto God, and obey him simply, ^^th
it which he shall command thee.

The obedience of Abraham is commended ^n scripture, because when God promised
^ym, that many people should descend from his son Isaacke, yet he commanded
^im to offer him up to him in sacrifice, ^ontrarie to his former promise:
Abraham ^ight have told him, that he cold not ^ulfill his commandment,
because it was ^ontrarie to that which he had told him before: but he held
his peace, and was ^bedient, referringe all to gods providence: ^or the good
obedient person, a though that which his superiors commands, do seem unto
him to be but some fond thing, yet if it imply no sin in it, he must with
silence obey thereunto, subduing hi^ own intelligence, and making it
agreeable unto his superiors.

Thou must not be judge unto thy governor, nor take on thee to know the cause,
of that which is commanded thee, for God likes better to have humble obeyers
in his house, then busy inquirers. Be thou no curious disputer, of that which
shall be commanded thee.

The beginning of all our misery was Euaes curious disputinge about the
commandment of God, Gene. 3.
her supreme governor. The devil reasoned this with her, why did God
command thee, that thou sholdest not eat of the tree of life* If she had
been a good obedient person, she would straight ways have made answer. I
know well it is commanded me, that I should not eat of it, and to me it
apperteyneth not to know the cause thereof, it is my duty to obey him, since
he is my God, and my creator, and it suffices me that am but a subject, to
know only that it is the will of my superiou^* But when Eua went about to
dispute the matter at large, she utterly undid her self*

It is a subjects part to obey, and not to dispute, and argue the cause why.
Hold thy peace and obey, give no answer (...) thy adversary that asks thee
why: for if thou do, thou will be soon overcome. Let thy will be all one,
with thy superiors will, for though the man that commands thee, be but of
mean goodness and capacity, yet the thing that he commands, being with
good will obeyed on thy behalf, shall through thy obedience be cause of much
profit, and merit unto thee. And if thou be obedient, it will be great cause of
thy quyetnes also. Take away thine own will, that is a burden and a trouble
unto thee, and resign it in^o thy rulers hand, and thou shalt be well ^eased
thereby.

It is a great quietness to have charge of nothing: The religious men have an
^appie life, when the inferiors do lay all the burden of their bodily cares
upon their superiors backs, that they may the while give them selves more
freely to the service of God, and the works of the spi^ite: But the prelates
them selves, that have ^he charge in their hand, can not inioye ^he like
prerogative and benefit. They that wholly addicte them selves to the world,
understand not what this means, neither do they taste any thing what
sweetenes there is in humble obedience.

They that have not tasted, what pleasure it is to be obedient for Christ's
sake, do love to be superiors them selves, and do fly away from all quyetnes
of spirit, and fondly do think that they shall find quyetnes in the
myddest of all their cares and business. The obedient persons, be they only
which do enjoy the liberty and freedom of the spirit and celestial
consolation.

Many do choose out places of consolation according to their own wills,
supposing to find comfort and contentement there, but there they have found
clean contrary, and have been much discomforted: and other good obedient
persons, do willingly go to places void in them of all comfort or
consolation, and yet there have they found comfort. But the truth is, that
there is no comfort, bu^ where God is, and God is never but with the obedient
person.

Be thou perfectly obedient, and th^^ be where thou will, and thou shall find
comfort every where, because God (...) with thee. But if thou will be
governed after thine own will, and wilt ^lit from place to place, for thy own
pleasure, believe me that where thou think to find Paradise, thou shall
happily find ^ell it self. For there, will thine own will make open war
against thee, there will thy passions assault thee both day and night, and
never suffer thee to have rest.

Prou. 21.
The wise man says, the obedient person shall win the victory. By subiecting
thy self unto other as thou ought, thou shall make thy self a great Lord
and ruler over all things.

THE POVERTY WHICH the g^spell teaches, is vearie great riches, for that it
leads us the right way to heaven, and gives us the means to help others
thither. CHAP. 31.
Happy be the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven: says
our Lord. Mat 5.
If any temporal prince should grant unto thee the keeping of one of his
castles: a bill ^^at were subscrybed with the kings hand ^ere more worth unto
thee, then a great ^^ale of money, for upon the sight of the ^inges hand,
thou shalt have the posses^^on thereof delivered thee, which thou ^oldest not
obtain for money.

Poverty is the same bill assigned of ^od our great king, by the which he
^^th granted unto the poor man Para^^ce, for as much as he has said him
^^lfe: That unto the poor man perteyneth ^^e kingdom of God. This warrante of
^^s is more worth for to obtain heaven ^^y, then all the temporal riches of
the ^orlde. It is a most true saying, that the ^^ore in spirit is happy, for
if he be happy that nothing craves, the rich man c^^^not be happy, that
craves after ma^^ things.

He that is poor in spirit, has all t^^^ he desires: Unto such (says
Christ) be^longeth the kingdom of heaven. If the rich man will have heaven,
let him go bu^ it at the poor man's house, for by alm^^ given unto him for
Gods sake, he man have it: for the poor man, has not heaven only for him
self by Gods promise but he may also bring the rich man the there by
purchasing of it at his hand^ where he may have it also vearie g^^^ cheap.

Rejoice that thou art poor, fin^^ thou art yet so rich, that thou haste
(...) only the kindome of God for thy self but may also make sale of it,
to hy^ that will by alms geuinge buy it of the^ yet shalt thou have
nevertheless there^^ for thy self, and for thine inheritance to the kingdom
of heaven can thou by (...) means forgo, except thou do pu^ away from
thee this great treasure (...) Evangelical poverty, whereby thou a^^^ made
inheritor unto it.

Poverty is a riches that is ease^^ kept, for no man will seek to take (...)
away from thee. No man will go to la^^ with thee for it. It is a sure and a
safe po^^session that no man will make claim v^^to get it from thee. Poverty
is disch^^ged clean of that final sentence, whi^^ ^^albe pronounced against
rich men in ^^ese words. I was hungry, and thou ^^uest me nothing to eat,
Mat. 5.
I was naked ^^d thou clothedst me not. The poor man ^^at has nothing to
give, is not bound unto these works of mercy, nor many ^ther works of
piety.

If poverty had not been good, Luc. 2.
the ^ngel would never have told the sheepe^eardes so particulerly, the
several points ^f Christ's poverty, tellinge them how christ our Savior was
borne in a stall, ^rapped up in poor clothes, and for ^ant of room, laid in
a maunger. For if ^ man mean to sell his house, he will show ^he byer all the
commodities thereof par^^culerlie.

The Apostle says of our Savior, 2. Cor. 2.
that ^e made him self poor, for to inriche ^s. He was poor at his birth, in
his life, and at his death. If the only begotten ^onne of god was made poor
for thy sake, ^hy art thou ashamed to be poor for ^is sake?

Holy poverty is a great riches: and ^or to be perfectly mortified, it is
neces^arie for thee to despise all these false ^iches: and to sequester thine
heart from ^he disordinate love of them, which is vn^ossible for thee to do
whilst thou have them.

Take the surest way: thou shall sooner ^ome unto God, being poor then being
^iche: the poor shepheardes came but a little way of, for to adore Christ our
redeemer in Bethelem, Luc 2. Mat. 2.
at the time of his birth, but the three kings came from far countries, a
great long journey, (...) show that rich men always take more pains to
come unto God, then the poor needy souls.

They which stand upon the ground are nearer unto heaven, then they which do
live below in vawtes under the ground: Even so are they nearer unto god, that
have the world under their feet then the rich men which do serve the world,
and have made them selves sla^^ unto it.

Rejoice that thou may be here^^ a companyon unto our master and ^^^uiour
Christ Jesus, who hanged on t^^ cross poor and naked, to the end, t^^^ thou
may hereafter be partaker with him of the blessed joys of heaven, and
enjoy the riches of his celestial treasors.

^OD WOULD HAVE US contynuallie to be exercised in doing good deeds, for unto
them that do them in the state of grace, they gain eternal life, and they
do dispose them that are out of that state, the sooner to do penance. CHAP.
32.
Never leave of doing well: 2. The. 3*
says S. Paul. For good works do never loose their merit. If thou do
live in the state of grace, thou shalt merit eternal life by them: and if
^^^t, yet shalt thou not fail of some beni^^^e by them.

The gold smith that makes a piece (...) work, either of silver or gold, if
the ^^rke frame not after his fantasy, he be^^neth to frame it a new again,
and loo^^^h nothing of the stuff it self, but loo^^^h only the fascion. To
work well is ^^^ayes good, for although it merit not ^^uen by means of the
evil state, that ^^ou wast in when thou did them, yet (...) continual use
of them, will make thee, ^^^er thou haste attained unto the state of ^^^ce, to
do them with the more ease. He that lives evil and does no goo^ deeds,
shall hardly after become a virtuous man: get therefore the custom of doing
well, that by the use the thing man be made easy.

Mat. 3.
They which were baptized by S. John Baptist, received not grace by the virtue
of the baptism, but were the better disposed after to receive the baptism of
Christ. So while thou art in sin, thou neither deseruest grace nor glory,
but thou does^ get this good by the contynuall life (...) virtuous deeds, that
when the time (...) grace comes, thou may easelie wood^^ well, and
therefore do thou never cea^^ laboringe to do well.

Gal. 3
The Apostle says, let us never (...) slow nor slack in well doing, for in

and ^et he would not have the beast cast away, ^ut commanded to have it sold
away, ^^d only the price thereof offered unto ^im. The works that be wroughte
in ^^nne, out of the state of grace, although ^^at they be morally good, yet
are they but ^^ke unto the unclean beast, and God re^eyueth not the work, but
only the price ^^ereof, being willinge that thou sholdest ^xercyse thy self
in good works, to the ^^tent that by custom of doing them, and ^y the
fulfilling of his commandments which thou art bound unto, God may ^ccepte
those works after in their due ^^me, although that presently those works ^oe
merit nothing.

That Doctor of the law, Mar. 12.
which de^aunded of Christ, which was the greatest ^ommaundement of the law,
although ^^at he asked it of him to tempt him with^ll, and of an evil intent,
yet in as much ^s the demand was good, he deserved ^y it, to have this much
light given him ^t Gods hand, that he told him he was ^ot far of from the
kingdom of God, ^or although that thou meritest not glory, yet do thou
merit temporal benefits thereby, and that the devil has the less power to
do thee harm: therefore it (...) good at all times, that thou sholdest
exer^cyse thy self in doing of good deeds, fr^^ some good by them will
redounde unto* thee at the last.

THE REVVARD OF Eternal life, is not given unto them th^^ begin to do
well, and after leave it of again, but they are only crovvne^ with
everlasting glory which do^^ persevere therein unto the end. CHAP. 33.
Mat. 10.
HE that perseuereth unto the end shall be saved* says Jesus Christ. Ma^^
begin with virtue, but few attain to the end^ of it. It profits tho^
nothing to have begone well, if tho^ do leave it of again. Take away
perseverance, and thy virtue shall have no reward, nor thy good work any
merit.

Some do begin well, and for tha^ they continue not in it, they do not
only loose the merit of their work, but also ^^serue to be punnyshed.

The friends of Job began well in ^^uing of him comfort, Job. 2.
and continued in ^euen days together, who because that ^^ey perseuered not in
that good work, ^^ey deserved punnishement at gods hand.

The beginning of Saul was good: 1. Re. 10.
^^^t because he perseuered not therein, he ^^ed and evil death. If thou do
despise ^^e vanity of the world, worldly men ^^ll begin to persecute thee.
Return ^^^t again to that which thou have once ^^ft, and quyte forsaken.

Many have had the world in contempt, ^^d yet because they have returned, and
^^oked back to the world again, like ^^tts wife, that looked back toward
So^^me, Gene. 19.
they have received their punnishe^ent therefore, and do now burn in ^ll for
ever.

Many are now in hell, that once des^sed the vanities of the world, but they
^^rseuered not therein. And our goostlie ^^emy the devil, cares not how well
^^ou begynnest, so that thou perseuerest ^^^t therein. Labor to continue in the
good ^^^y wherein thou have begone, and con^^^ue on thy course, if thou do
think ^^wynne the victory. Apoc. 2.
Be faithful unto (...) death, and thou shall get the crown of ^^fe.

In the border of the chief Priests ^^sture, Exodus 28.
there were wroughte certain ^^und gernetts, which stood betwix^^ the little
belles of gold that hang at the (...) of the vesture. Of all the fruit that
gro^^eth, only the pounegarnet has a crow^ in the top, the which, because
it is (...) reward of virtue, is placed among g^^ works, which are signified
by the (...) belles of gold: they are not set in (...) highest part, nor in
the midst of (...) garmente, because they are not given v^^to those that
begin well, nor unto th^^ that do come unto the midst of the work: but
they are set in the end or lo^^^est part of the vesture, because they o^^^^
shall receive the crown, that do co^^^^nue unto the later end.

The tree that is often removed ^^^uer takes any sure rooting: and if th^^
do change and alter thy course, (...) do not continue in that thou haste
(...) begone, thou shalt never bring forth ^^^ny fruit of virtue: By the
frequenting good works, and the multiplyeng of v^^^tuous deeds, the very
habit of ver^^ is fully grounded in thee.

Eccl. 27.
Is there any thing better then Go^ that thou will leave the service of hy^
for any other thing? Solomon says, th^^ the wise man perseuereth and abides
(...) his wisdom firmly, like unto the sonn^ but the fool changes still
like (...) moon. Be not thou moved at every win^^*

Gene. 15.
The birds would have troubled Ab^^^ham in the offerringe of sacrifice to Go^
almighty, but Abraham would not leaue^ his sacrifice, for any trouble that they
cold give him. If thou do give thy self unto prayer, take heed that thou
be not mo^ested with busy and importante cares, which will annoy thee and
trouble thee, as the birds troubled Abraham, but thou must drive them away
from thee, and con^inue earnest in that which thou go a^out: for what good
does it to take great matters in hand, and bring none of them ^o a good
end. Spend not all thy life in ^eginning to do well, for fear lest death
^ome upon thee, and find thee idle and ^ut of the way.

In the psalm it is written: Psalm. 38
Man passes ^way like an image. A painted image of a man that is made sitting
in a chair, gives (...) show to the eye, as though it would rise and ^tande
up, but it never stands, it seems ^s though it would go, but it never
goes: And so plays many a man that is often ^etermining to draw toward God,
but yet ^e goes not to him at all, he makes ma^y profers of going, and yet
stands still when he should go. Our Lord him self ^ayeth: Luc. 9.
No man that puts his h^nde to ^he plowe and looks back is meet for ^he
kingdom of God.

The four beasts mentioned in the Apocalips, never had rest day nor night.
Apo. 4.
No more ought thou to take any rest, ^ntill the work that thou haste
taken in ^ande be at an end.

The kyne which were yoked together* and brought back to the Arc from the
Philistines, never declined neither to the right hand nor to the left, but
kept the straight way on to Bethsamies, 1. Re. 6
and although that the calves which were sh^^ up the while, bleated after
their dammes, yet they never forsook their way, nor sought to go back again,
but kept on still their way that they were entered in. And since that thou have
taken on thee to carry the yocke of our Lord, and to bea^^ on thy back the
burden of his most holi^^^ law thou must not go out of the way, n^^ leave yt
by any means although that the sensual appetites, like natural children do
seek to draw thee back again (...) the world. But let virtue vanquysh
^^^turall love, and do thou proceed in the journey like one that were deaf,
(...) gave no ear unto the world, but hold (...) thy way and give no answer
at al^ neither unto the world nor to the flesh until thou come to Bethsamies,
which is as much to say as the house of the son, which is the eternal light,
and infinite clearenes, where thou shall see God in his glory.

OUR LORD GOD SVFFRETH us to be tempted dyuerslie, to the intent, that when
we have by his help overcome the sundry temptations of our spiritual enemy,
we may receive the greater reward and glory at gods hand. CHAP. 34.
MY son when thou do put thy self to the seruinge of God, Eccl. 2.
prepare thy heart against temptation: says the wise man. Thou must not
marvel that thou art assaulted with temptations when thou beginnest to serve
God, for thine armoure of defense, was not bestowed upon thee, but to the
intent that ^hou sholdest defend thy self therewith ^n time of battle. But
if thou suffrest ^emptations, do not thou take any discomforte therein at all,
for the devil never tempts those that be his already.

Pharao the great king of Egypt, Exodus 5.
did persecute the children of Israel, with more extremity when they were
ready to depart away from him, then when he did peaceably possess them.
Gene. 31.
Laban did never persecute Jacob, but when he was goinge away from him, and so
fares our adversary with us. He vexes him with greater storms of
temptations, that is about to go from him, and to give him self to the
service of God, then him whom he is presently in quiet possession of:

Our Lord suffers thee to be tempted, to the intent that he way prove thee,
and see whether thou will perceuer in his service which thou have taken in
hand? The Angel said unto Tobias. Tob. 12.
Because thou were acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation should
try thee. But beware that thou give no consent, unto temptation. For though
that fire be stricke^ out of a flint stone by force of the steel, yet if there
be no apt matter under it, for the fire to take hold on, it serves to no
purpose. And so though that the devil with the steel of his temptation, do
stricke upon the stone of thy sensuality, yet shall he never stricke any fire
out of yt, that shall do thee any harm except that thou do join the
consent of thy will thereunto. But if thou be not war^^ and wise, thou will be
often deceived, for the woolfe does often apparel him self in a Lambs
skin, the better to dissemble his malice withal, and this is the most
dangerous temptation of all other^ For vices when they come apparele^ with the
cloathinge of virtues, bear the countenance of friends when they be i^ deed
our most extreme enemies.

The rouers on the sea, do always carry in their ships with them, banners
of peace, when they intend nothing but war, to make their enemies to take
them for friends, and so with the more ease and safety, take them prisoners,
and make them their slaves. The devil does also spread forth the banners of
such virtues as Christians have in reverence, to the end that he may be taken
for a friend amongst them, and so the easilier bring them into his subjection.
So deceyueth he many under the color and show of virtue. He transfigureth him
self into an Angel of light, and changes his shape like as sheroboams wife
did, 3. Re. 14.
who sought by the heighte of counterfeytinge her attire, to deceive the
Prophet Abias.

Let not thy self be carried away with every vain blaste of wind that
blows, but make trial first, and see whether the spirit be of God or not:
according to the counsel of S. John, saying: 1. Io. 4.
Believe not every spirit, but prove whether it be of God.

The crafts and subtilties of the devil be infinite, he makes show sometime
to stryke at one place, when he intends to hit an other: and some other times
he fayneth as though he would run away from a man, when he makes a short
return again to find him the more unprovided, and so with more ease overcome
him: and if that temptation do cease and forsake thee for a time, yet account
not thy self in full assurance, but look to have him come the more fiercely
upon thee again, and in time of peace, be more vigilante and watchefull, then
thou would be in the time of war.

The ship that sayleth does incur more dangers many times when the weather
is calm, then when great storms do arise: for in the calm, the sailors go
without care, and dread no danger, but in time of tempest they provide for
every mischief that may fall. And one of the greatest mischeefes that may
happen to any man, is never to be tempted at all: and thou ought never to
think, that thou haste more temptations, then when thou perceyuest them not.

When thy meat first enters into thy stomach, the natural heat begins
(as it were) to make war with thy meat until that the substance thereof be
altered and changed, and if when that is disgested, there be not a new
supplye made of more sustinance again, for to make a new combat, then does
the stomach make war with it self, and without some other matter be given
it to work upon, it consumes it self, and kills thee: So if there be no
temptations outwardly given thee, there will happily some grow within thee,
that may destroy thee.

Be not much grieved, that thou art tempted, persecuted, and troubled, for
^hen will our Lord be at home with thee, ^o help thee most of all, except that
thou ^oest fail on thine own part: and if that temptations do fail thee
without, ^hou shall not fail of most grievous ^emptations within, which will
make most ^ruell war against thee.

God will that thou be tempted for ^hyne own profit, 1. Cor. 10.
for it is necessary that ^emptations do come, says the Apostle, ^^ll they
that will live godly in Jesus Christ, do suffer persecution, and none shall
receive the crown, but he that figh^eth after the law of the game. And how
shall any war be made, except there be some to fight, without victory there
can be no glory, and how should there be any victory where no war is made.

GOD SENDS US ALvvayes temptations to amend us by them, and to make us
better, and that we may be vanquishers of them, whereby we may be made
vvorthie of the glory celestial. CHAP. 35.
Iac. 12*
HAPPY is that man which suffers temptation, for after that he is full
proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which God has promised to all
those that do love him. Thus says the Apostle S. James, the time of
temptation indureth not long, and the reward that thou gettest, if thou do
overcome shall be infinite,

Thou do not love thy self so much as God does love thee, all that he does
is for thine advantage. God will have thee the more to be tempted, because thou
sholdest merit the more, temptation is gods permyssion, Job. 2.
the devil tempted Job, but he had first gods license to do it* which if he
never had had, he cold never have been able to have tempted him.

1* Re. 18.
We read in scripture that by Gode^ permission, the evil spirit vexed Saul.
The devil is said to be naught, because he has an evil will to do us harm
whom our Lord suffers to tempte us, but yet no further then he will, nor then
his pleasure is to give him leave, so as no, man is tempted but by the
suffrance of God, who more desires our welfare, then our selves can do: thou
ought to take comfort by thy temptations, considering the commodity that
comes by them.

The mariner would never venture to pass the dangerous seas, if he did but
only consider the troubles and danger of his passage. Nether would the
laboring man endure so much cold, or heat, but in hope only of harvest to
gather up the corn. And though the resisting of temptations, seem troublesome
unto thee, yet the reward that thereof ensues, might make thee bold and
encourage thee, and yet in this life also thou shall not be without spiritual
comfort, by thine hope of victory* for in all our temptation, God always
seeks our amendmente and prefermente He might well have sent the great
floode of waters, to have drowned the sinful world withal, without gyuing
any warning thereof before hand, but because he sought the amendment of
sinners, and had rather have them to be saved ^hen to be cast away and
destroyed, therefore did he send Noe, Gene. 41.
to give them warninge of it, an hundred years before it came.

When he determined to bring the great famine into Egipte, he gave Pharao
understanding of it before, and provided Joseph to make provision before hand
for the safegarde of the people, which he never would have done, if he had
absolutely determined before that they should all have perished by that famine:
and because that our most merciful Lord is always more desirous of our life
then of our death, and ever seeks our amendmente, therefore did he send unto
Niniue that great city, Iona. 1.
the prophet Jonas, to preach penance unto it, before he would utterly
subuerte the city. Receive chasetisement at gods hand willingly, as of a most
pitiful father because that in thy punnyshement he seeks thy profit and
commodity.

If temptations had not been good for thy salvation, God would never have
suffered thee to have been tempted. But he dealing most liberally with thee,
has ordained many means for thee to work thy salvation by, and to merit thy
self glory.

God does thee more honor in gyuinge thee temptation and tribulation, by which
thou may merit glory, then if he should give it thee freely without
doing any thing for it.

Labor to overcome, and to be a conqueror over thy temptations, for the
travail thereof is but short, and the merit vearie great. When the king
does mean to advance any man to honor, and ^o give him a reward, he will
place him first in some charge of peril and importance.

Susanna had never been in such estimation and reverence amongst men, Dan. 13.
^f she had not first been tempted by defamation: but she overcame her
te^ptatio^ and merited both honor here in the earth, and a glorious crown in
heaven, so that her temptation did her more good, then harm.

Of old holy Toby, the scripture says, that God suffered him to be tempted,
that there should remain to his posterity a memory, and an example of the
great patience that he had.

PRAYER IS A SINGVLER remedy against temptations, that yt may the better be
heard of God, it behooves it to be often, fervent, and free from all worldly
affection. CHAP. 36.
PRAY you that ye enter not into temptation, Mat. 26.
says our Lord. To the intent that thou be not ouercomen by temptation,
Christ would have thee for to pray: against the assaults of the devil, Mat. 6.
the best defense is prayer, if thou take God for thy shilde who can do thee
any harm?

Thy own force is not strong enough to defend thee, for if thou do lean
unto the trust of thy self, and have confidence in thine own strength, thou will suerlie be ouercomen. 2 Cor. 3.
But give ear unto the Apostle that says, I can do all things in him, that
is my comforter.

Our Savior teachinge us how we should pray, said that we should ask of
God that he would deliver us from temptation. A singular mean to overcome
temptation is prayer, by the which God is called on, to be thine help and
defense.

We being of our selves but weak* and all our sufficencie coming from
God, ^^uing here environed with so much trou^le, and so many worldly
temptations, it is ^ll the help we have, to send our prayers ^^s messengers
unto God, to demand succor of him.

Prayer is a messenger that declares ^ur necessity unto God, according to the
^aying of the Prophet Esaias, Esaias. 38.
let my prayer (...) O Lord) enter unto thee, like a speedy messenger. Which
reports unto God ^ll our necessities, and then asks remedy of all at his
hand.

A good messenger ought to have two qualities, the one to be quick, and light,
^he other to be diligent in that which he goes about, lest through the
messengers necglige^ce the mischief may fall while ^he message is a doing.
And he that will go lightly, and run a pace, must put of all that may be
burthenous unto him. Thy prayer can not lightly ascend unto God, if thou be
ouerladen with the tormoyles and business of the world. These worldly business
and temporal affairs, wherein thou do occupy thy self, be ^earie
contrary unto prayer, and if thou will have the fruit of prayer, thou must
fly from all temporal business: and it is necessary for thee also to be
fully mortified, and to put from thee all worldly consolation. And if thou will give thy self unto God, thou must do away from thee, the vain cares of
this world.

The second thing that apperteyneth unto a good messenger is to be diligent in
the cause he goes about, and to use a good dexterity in delyueringe of hi^
message, and soliciting the same, and not to faynte in his suit until he have
brought that to pass that he comes for. And so must thy prayer be not slow
but dilligent, not warm but fervent and fiery. And although thou be not heard
at the very first, yet thou must be importunate, and pers^^er still calling,
as the holy disciples did, that continually perseuered in prayer.

Act. 1.
Make means unto those that be in favor with the great king, that they may
speak unto him for thee, and be thy daily intercessors, as they usually do,
that have any suit unto any temporal prince. Call earnestly on our blessed
lady, the mother of God for to help thee, and all the holy Saints of heaven.

Our Savior teaches us how we ought to behave our selves toward him, in the
parable of him that asks three loaves of bread of his friend, where he
says unto him, that if he would not gy^e him that which he asked of him
because he was a friend, yet at the leastewyse, that he should give it him
because of his importunity.

Our Lord would have thee to be importunate, and does s^ay his hand from
gyuing thee that which thou demaundest, to make thee to persevere in good, and
that thy merit may thereby be increased, that so thou may be made worthy to
receive that which he means to give thee, which is more then thou do ask
of him: and although that God does know in all things our necessity, yet
would he have us to send our messenger of prayer unto him, because his will
is, that we should be delivered from our temptations by that means*

It is necessary for thee to pray, not because thou sholdest make God to know
that which he knew not before, nor for that he should change his
determination ^y thy prayer, but only that by thy pray^r, thou sholdest use
those means, by which God determined to give thee that thing which thou
desire of him.

Thy prayer presents unto God thy ^ecessities, it humbles thine heart, it
de^yuereth thee from evil, it moves God ^o show thee favor, and reconcyleth
thy ^oule unto him.

Prayer ouercometh and conquererh ^ll things: It ouercometh men as it
appea^eth by David, Judith, and Judas Macha^eus, who all overcame their enemies
by ^rayer. 1. Re. 18.
It overcame the fire when it bur^ed not the three children that were put unto
the fiery furnace at Babylon. It ouer^ame the water, Iudi. 1^* Match 15. Dan. 3.
when Moses by prayer ^ade the red sea to open and deuyde. ^^t overcame
time, when Elias did there^y make it to rain, or to leave rayning* as it
pleased him. It overcame the body, when Moses continued forty days and
forty nights without eating or drincking* 3. Re. 17
only sustained by the help of prayer. It overcame death as is manifest in
Ezechias, Exodus 24
who being adjudged by God his sentence to dye, did get by prayer diverse
years of life. It overcame the clouds, in as much as Elias by prayer, 4. Re.
20
carried the clouds from the sea, unto the land. It ouercometh the heavens as
appears by Joshua, that by prayer made the soonne and heavens to stand still
and move not, and above all this, prayer is of that force, and of that effect,
that it overcame God him self.

Moses prayed unto God, and he straight ways made answer unto him saying.
Let me alone that I may revenge me on them. God does here confess that he was
holden back by the prayer of Moses, Exodus 32
since he willed him, to let him be revenged of his people. Mar. 11.
Our Lord says: All that you do ask in prayer, you shall obtain.

Seeing then that prayer can so much prevail in all troubles, afflictions,
temptations, and tribulations, take it for thy sure shilde, for without it,
sha^te thou never get perfect victory.

EVERY THING DOES naturally tend unto his proper end, and the end for
which man was created being God him self, he ought to despise all worldly
things, that might dravv him from the right way unto him, and only apply
him to the exercise of such things as may further him to that end which he
seeks after. CHAP. 37.
I AM both beginning and end: says God. Apoc. 1.
The rivers do all come forth of the sea, and do thither return again, and
all things do naturally crave their proper end, and ^^re by nature helped
toward it. And as ^od is our sea from which we came, and ^he very center
whereunto we tend, our ^oules by nature must seek unto him, and ^^bor to come
unto him, as to the very end ^or which they were created.

Our soul can find no resting place ^ere in this present life, for God him
self ^ust be the rest thereof, as the uttermost ^^nde of all that it seeks
after, and the very cause of the creation thereof.

God has made us for the love of him self, and therefore our heart must
needs be unquiet, until it may attain and come unto him. All things has
God created for man, and man has he only made for him self. It is a thing
much to be marueyled at, that all the creatures that God has made, do those
things, that they are created for, and only man is a rebel unto God, and
endeuoreth not to come unto the end that he is ordained for.

God created not thee for the earth, but for heaven: he made thee not, to the
end that thou sholdest seek after worldly things, as the final end of thy
creation, but that thou sholdest only seek after him. The beasts of the
field which (...) has ordained for the earth, do carry their heads down,
looking always toward the ground: but man whom he has created for heaven, he
has made to go^ straight upright, that he may behold heaven, unto the which
he belongs, and toward which he daily should draw. Be not thou to much
occupied in the way^ thither, neither be thou disquieted in t^^ journey hence:
let not thy reason be confounded, with to much busiyng thy self about these
corruptible worldly things but set thine heart upon the land of t^^ living,
the very proper country in dee^^ where thou may enjoy things (...) ^^biect
to any corruption, make no account (...) these things visible, but lift up
thine ^^rt unto things invisible. Labor earnestly (...) come unto the end
that thou art or^^yned for. Why did God create thee? ^^t only because thou
sholdest enjoy ^^m. Let it be therefore thine whole study ^^d labor to
attain to him as to thy most ^^ppie end.

The Prophet David made his de^^unde, Psalm. 23.
who shall ascend up into the hill ^our Lord? Or who shall rest in his holy
^^ce? He answered him self again ^^ight ways saying. He that has not
re^^^ued his soul in vain. And that thing ^^wayes received in vain, which
is not ^^rcysed to the end, that it is ordained (...) thou sholdest in vain
buy a garment, ^hou would never wear it, and in ^^ne sholdest thou have a
soul, if thou ^^te not therewithal do those things (...) exercise those
functions, that thy ^^e is created for.

God has created for thee a memory (...) thou sholdest remember him with:
(...) understanding that thou sholdest ^^w him with, and a will that thou
sholdest (...) him by. It is but meet, that since (...) has made thee, to the
end that thou ^^^dest love him, and serve him, thou ^^^dest spend these short
days of thine ^^^e exercise of such things as might ^^^ge thee unto that
glorious end, that (...) wast created for.

He that having a soul, does live (...) though he had none, and he that
occupyeth his understanding, in the applying (...) it to get worldly honors and
riches, and bestows his will in the louinge of the things of this world:
such a one receives his soul in vain, because God created it not for that
purpose.

Felicity is the last end of man, and (...) the which all other things are
ordayne^ in their due course. Let not the final (...) of thy trauayles be
intended unto any thing besides God, nor do not thou re^^ upon any earthly
thing, for neither (...) nor, riches, nor knowledge, nor any thing here on the
earth, can thoroughly qu^^ thee and content thee. Take away th^^ heart from the
love of all worldly thi^^ and love God only, for whom and (...) whom thou wast
created.

Despise this present world, and th^^ shall come unto thy desired end: and
^^^ly this may suffice to persuade thee for^^ despise the vanity of the
world, to (...) that thou waste created for heaven. Al^ not thy self so much
as to delight the^ these contemptible worldly things* and thou shalt be quiet
here in this world for the time, and glorious and happy forever after in
heaven.

^ORRIBLE AND Fearful shall the day of Judgment be, in the which thou must
render account of thy thoughts, words, and works, and shall be judged for
them according to the rigor of justice. CHAP. 38.
ENTER not into judgment with thy seruante (said David that holy man of God.
Psa. 142.
) David was the seruante of God, and yet he desires him, not to exact^
straight account of him. The Iudge^ent of God shall come with that rigor,
^^at holy David being such is he was, ^^old nevertheless gladly have
escaped (...) And if then, he which served God, did ^^are his judgment how
much more ought ^^^e to fear it, that serves still the world? (...) says
enter not (O Lord) into iudge^ent with thy seruante: what reckenynge ^^all
then the servants of the world make, (...) the serua^te of God be so much
affrayed? and if the just man shall scarce be saved, 1. Pet. 4.
that shall then the poor sinner do.

It is a thing to be much lamented to ^e any man live here all his time
shyning in honor and in vanities, and yet be (...) near fallinge into so dark
and dangerous a place, as that all the corners of (...) conscience, and
secrets of his heart, shall diligently searched and tried out by the light of
gods Majesty, shynynge mo^^ brighte therein then any torch or candle light.

Sop. 1. Dan. 5.
Balthazar king of Babylon living in all manner of vice, and satisfying his
lust^^ in all kind of sin, had sodeynlie upon him the hand of gods Justice,
that wrote the sentence of death against him signifyinge unto him, that God
would take an accom^^ of him, and put his sins in a balance an^ divide his
kingdom.

The time draws veary near, (...) thou must also give a strayte account
(...) all thy works, words and thoughts: (...) the secrets of thine heart
shall be lay^^ open, and all thy privy thoughts sha^^ come forth in open
show, for which th^^ art to receive thy punnishment with a^^ rigor of justice:
thou shalt not be able (...) deny any thing, for thy sins shall lie ^^pen
against thee, and thine own consc^^ence shall be thine accuser: there will
(...) no pleadinge allowed thee, before the mighty King of glory, all thy
sins shall be put into the balance, and all the c^^^cumstances thereof shall
be wayed, and (...) the benefits which thou haste recey^^ of Gods hand, and
then shall thy king^dome be divided, when thy body shall (...) ^ut into the
grave, to be eaten by worms, and thy soul shall be sent to hell, there ^o
remain for ever: Then shall no prayer ^^e heard for thee, the Saints that
thou ^ast wont to call upon, to be intercessors ^or thee, will then be so
deaf that they ^ill not hear thee, nor any answer shalt ^hou have of them.
All that then thou shall ^ee, shall be nothing else, but thine angry judge over
thine head, and hell open under thy feet: on thy right hand shall ^e thy
sins that accuse thee: on thy left ^ande the devils that shall tormente
thee: ^ithin thee shall thy conscience be gnaw^^g on thee, and without thee all
the world ^n a burning fire.

If Adam for a little meat which he ^^oke contrary to Gods will, Gene. 3.
did so much ^eeke to fly his presence, what will thou ^oe, or where will
thou hyde thee, when ^od shall come to take an account of ^ee, and shall find
thee so full of vices and sins? Psalm. 67.
Even as wax melts before ^^e fire, so shall sinners perish before the
^resence of God. It is written: Psalm. 32.
Let the ^hole earth tremble before him, and let ^ll the inhabita^tes of the
world be moved (...) his presence.

It will be a greater punnishement for ^ee to be separated from the presence of
^od, then ^o feel the sensible torment of ^ell. The Prophet Esaias says, let
the wic^ed man be separated, Es. Vlt.
to the intent that ^e may not see the glory of God. The lovers of this world
do never know t^^ vanity in which they do live, until t^^ pain has
lightened their vnderstand^^^ and made them bewail their great (...)
felicity.

Despise thou unfeignedly, the vani^^^ and false shows of this transitory
wor^^ and so shall thou best escape the pain an^ tormente of hell hereafter.

THE PERPETVALL PAIN of hell which are prepared for (...) lovers of these
worldly vanities, (...) great, so horrible, and so fearful, (...) the
only consideration thereof, vv^^ sufficient occasion to hold a man ba^^ from
sin, if there were none other. CHAP. 39.
SO much as he did glory^^^ his pleasures, Apo. 18.
so much to^^^ and sorrow do thou g^^^ unto him: (says God. T^^^ vanities of
this world oug^^test thou for many causes despise, and for to do it the
better, it ^^^fiseth thee to know the great torme^^ wherewith they shall be
punnished.

It is written: That according to the measure of thy sin, Deu. 25.
shall the measure of ^hy strypes be. If thou would but consider, wherein
these pleasures and vani^ies in which thou lyuest, have to take ^nde, thou
would live in some sorrow and ^itternes of mind, and of such things ^s thou
now delightest in, thou would ^ake small comfort.

Job said in the person of worldly ^^en: That which my soul abhorred, Job. 6.
is ^ow my cheifest food. In this life men ^re loath to touch any thing, that
may give them any displeasure or annoyance, and ^n the next life, every thing
will give them displeasure and tormente: whereby ^t is to be gathered, that
they which do ^yue in this life in most delights, shall in ^he next life
find the pains of hell more ^harpe and vehement. For look how much any
thing does give resistance unto his ^ontrarie, so much is the operation of
^^at thing, perceived to be more forcible, which ouercometh and maistereth that
which resisted it. Iron does resist the fire, ^ore then wood does, but when the
fire ^ath ouercomen the Iron, and got full do^ynion over it, then is the heat
of the ^^on far greater, then the hea^e of the ^ood: So they which in this
life, do feel ^o sorrow, shall feel in hell the more ^orment, as by the
contrary again, the ^ood men that felt here but small rest, shall ^nde and
perceive afterward the greater pleasure and comfort. Sep. 6. A^oc. 9 Psalm. 43.
The mighty men shall suffer mighty torments, they shall desire to die, and
death shall fly away from them, and death shall be their food.

The grass does feed the beast that eats thereof, and afterward it
begins to grow again: Even so shall wicked men be ever dyinge, but shall
never be dead, and how much soever they be tormented by pain, yet shall their
torments never make an end of them.

Consider how hardly God will deal with his enemies, that so sharply
handeleth his friends in this world. Gal. 1.
The Apostle says, the friend of this world is an enemy unto God. The holy
Martyrs that were gods friends suffered many cruel torments here. And do
thou think, that geuinge thy self to the pleasures in this world, thou shall
find rest and ease in the next.

Iher. 22.
Iheremy says, they against whom there was no judgment, have drunk of the
cup of affliction: and do thou look to be accounted as innocent? No, thou
shall not be taken as innocent, but thou shall drink of the cup.

I have sworn by my self, (says our Lord) that thou shall be as a perpetual
wilderness, and a contynuall reproof.

Deceive not thy self, nor do not thou think, that poverty, sorrow, and
torment, were made for goodmen, for although that God suffers them to taste
of them here for a time, yet are they not purposelie provided for them. For God
has chosen out the good for his own glory. Heb. 6.
But these afflictions do properly apperteyne unto thee, and are reserved for
thee, although thou do now escape them, and they fly away from thee.

All the torments that the holy Mar^irs suffered, if they were all joined
together in one, will not be equal, nor able to counteruayle one of the least
torments which the damned do suffer in hell.

If God would not spare his Angels when they offended him, how will thou ^ooke
to be delivered from the fiery pit of hell prison? Thou Capernahum that ^idest
exalte thy self up unto the stars, Mat. 11.
^hou shall descend down into the bot^ome of hell.

And if thou be afraid to be by night ^n the dark among the bodies of dead
men, how will thou abide to be in the dark amongst so many dead men where
^hou shall neither see son, nor moon, ^or star light. It is a most
miserable ^ountrey to dwell in where there is con^inuall night, and never any
day.

And if now thou can not suffer the ^ighte of one devil, how will thou
endure then the sight of so many together? And if thou can not abide to
hold thy finger a little while in the fire, how will ^hou abide to tarry so
long together in ^ell fire, in comparison of which, the fire which thou do
here see, is but as it were a fire painted on a wall.

If a little grief do now seem paynefull unto thee, how will thou suffer all
the infirmities and disseases that thy body may bear? All the infirmities
that man's body is here subject unto, shall the damned man have in hell, and
every part of a man shall suffer there greater torment, then any man can here
imagine in this life, and if every evil savor offend thee, and annoy thee
here, how will thou abide the most loathsome and filihie savor of hell? If
only one body of a damned person, were laid upon the earth, it would so
corrupt the air with the vile stynke thereof, that it would cause a
universal plague over the whole earth.

If thou sholdest be laid in a most soft and delicate bed, and have all
things ministered unto thee there, that might move thee to take delight therein,
yet if thou sholdest have all this, under condition that thou sholdest not
depart out of it in forty years together, but be bound to be there all that
time, thou would take it for an intolerable pain and torment. How will thou
then endure to be bound in fiery cheynes in some filthy, corner of hell,
where thou shalt never rise again* And what can be more miserable then to be
altogether void of hope, and to be most assured that never remedy will be had.

Now thou that do live here in the vanities of this world, and do set
more by them, then by God him self, look about thee, and consider with thy
self, these bitter and sharp torments that thou may thereby be moved to
do penance for thy sins, while thou have time, and that thou may so
despise and set naught by these worldly vanities, that God may deliver thee
from these great infernal torments and perpetual lamentations.

THE GLORY FELICITY, and beatitude, which they get, which for the love of
God do despise the world with all the vanities thereof, is so great and
infinite, that it far exceeds all man's understanding, neither can any
tongue of man express it, or declare it. CHAP. 40.
THESE (worldly men) shall go into everlasting torments, and the just men
shall go to life everlasting,

Even as the just Judge will give eternal torment to those that have forsaken
God, and preferred the corruptible goods of this world, before the
everlasting Lord him self. So unto him that will for gods sake despise these
earthly things, our Lord will say to him, as in the gospel is mentioned.
Mat. 25.
Rise up, thou faithful servant that have in small things been trusty for I
will give thee charge over greater things.

Gene. 48.
Joseph bringing his two sons to his father Jacob, to receive his blessing
before he died, placed Manasses that was the elder of them on his fathers
right hand, and Ephraim that was the younger, he set on his left hand, after
the manner of the world, which always gives honor to great men and despises
the meaner sort: But wise Jacob in gyuing of his benediction unto them,
preferred the younger, and laid his right hand upon him, and on the elder he
laid his left hand. So will God do, when he shall come to judge the world:
he will lay the right hand of his glory, upon those that in this world stood
upon the left hand of adversities, and contrarywyse, will lay the left hand
of his everlasting punnishment on those that have here rested them on the right
hand of these worldly felicities.

The goodness of God is great, that gives unto good men so great honors and
rewards, for so small labors and trauaylls bestowed: when thou beholdest the
presence of God, thou shalt have still before thine eyes, all that thine heart
can desire, and so many felicities, that as the Apostle says. The eyes have
not seen, 1. Cor. 2.
nor the ears have not heard, neither has it descended into the heart of man,
what things God has prepared for them that do love him.

It is more easy to tell what is wantinge, then what is abounding in the
eternal felicities of heaven. Apoc. 21.
He will wype away the tears from the eyes of his Saints, and they shall
neither weep nor lamente any more, for there shall be perfect joy. And there
shall all the causes of our joy be joined together in one. The brethren of
Joseph rejoiced, Gene. 45.
and Pharao also with all his whole householde. But how much more must thy joy
be, then theirs was, that reioysest with God and all his Saints?

If the poor birds do joy at the rysinge of the soonne, how much more
ought our souls to rejoice, when they shall see the son of Justice so
gloriously shyning.

If the three wise men that came to seek Christ, received so great joy, Mat.
2.
by the seeinge of the star, how much more joy shall they receive that do
behold the glory of the saints in heaven?

If Saint John Baptist were so full of joy, that he leaped in his mothers
belly at the only hearing of Christ's presence, Luc. 1.
without any seeinge of him with his corporal eyes, how much more shall we
rejoice, beholding him face to face in his glory?

If the Bethsamites rejoiced so much at the seeing of the Arc of our Lord
return home again, 1. Reg. 6.
and Zacheus received Christ into his house with so much joy, with how much
more reason, Luc. 9.
may we rejoice, by enioyinge his glorious presence, Mat. 13.
in his own eternal tabernacle of heaven.

If he that found out the hidden treasor with so great joy, did sell all
that he had, for to have it, how much more shall our soul rejoice in finding
and possessing the divine treasor of his glory? If the people did so much
rejoice when Solomon was anointed king, that the veary earth shook with the
cry that they made for the joy thereof, how much more shall thy joy be to
see the king of glory sit in the high throne of his Majesty?

And if God would bestow upon thee. but one half hours joy of that infinite
felicity, thou ought for it to despise a thousand such worlds as this is:
how much more then ought thou with thine heart to despise these base, vile
pleasures of this short life, to gain thereby the infinite eternal joy of
heaven.

All were it so that this world were good, and all that is in it, were
greatly to be esteemed, and that thou sholdest live in it a thousand years,
and enjoy thy perfect health all that while, with as much honor as thou
coldest wish to have, what were all this? no better then chafe in comparison
of the most happy state that thou shalt have in heaven, by enioyinge the
blessed presence of God, but what is then this base beggarly pleasure of this
short life, being such as it is, to be accounted of, in respect of the joys
of heaven.

That is the very true and perfect joy in deed, which is received of the
creator him self, and not that which comes from the creature, which when thou
haste gotten, no man can take from thee again, in comparison whereof, all joy
is but sorrow, all pleasure pain, all sweetenes bitterness, all beauty, fowlenes
and lothsumnes.

The vearie true substanciall joys that thou ought to delight in, and take
as thy final felicity, be these heavenly and everlasting joys, which thou
must love, and which thou were created for.

Set therefore before thine eyes as the vearie true seruante of Jesus Christ
the land of the living, toward which thou art going, and despise the
vanity of this world, that so thou may merit and get the heavenly glory,
and eternal felicity, where thou may live with Christ, and reign with him
for ever.
