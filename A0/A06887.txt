Here is a short Resytal of certain holy Doctors which pro ueth that the
natural body of christ is not contained in the Sacrament of the Lords supper
but fyguratyuely* collected in myter by Ihon Mardeley

()

IT is marueled much
Men's minds is soch
To sow discord
In hand to take
Any book to make
That does not accord
With Gods holy word
That two edged sword
which cutteth both ways
From that Testament
They do dyscente
Into profane ways
For many which lokes
Upon soche books
Plainly does see
With words confuse
Such do abuse
The verytye
For where they say
Present always
Is flesh carnal
As they defyne
Under bread and wine
A body natural
That is easyer said
Than can be proved
By the scriptures
For bread and wine
To all men's eyes
Be two creatures
Of their probacion
To make relation
Where as they veryfye
Christ at his maundye
Gave his natural body
That scripture does deny
They say he is almyghtye
And able for to supplye
And perform his saying
Or else it should be counted
In him somewhat wanted
And not able to do all thing
To answer this
The scripture is
Hear my defense
And Doctors ancient
Do full consent
To this pretense
Where Christ at his maundye
Spoke these words truly mat. xvi*

It was but fyguratyuely
When as he said
Take eat this bread
This is my body
Which is for many broken
when he had so spoken
He took the cup saying
This cup here present
Is the new testament
In my blood sheddynge
Saynet Augustyne does say
Look where ye have allwaye Augu. in libro. iii de doctrina christiana si au^t
flagitiu^ ^ut facimus iubere uidetur figurata locutio est. xvi Orige^in leuit
homi. vii agnosce quam figure sunt que in uoluminibus, domini scripte sunt. etc.

Any scripture which seameth to be
Of any thing commanded
That must then be applied
To be spoken but figuratyuely
And also Orygen that clerk
wylleth us for to mark
with our minds spiritually
Saying all soche scriptures
That they be but fygures
And not to be taken carnally
Now take this and eat
Is after the letter meat
For they did eat in deed
that bread mistycally
So eat we his body
If we be spiritually minded
Now to use that ordinance
Is but a remembrance
Of Christ's pain and passion
For by it we do know
And to the faithful show
His death until he come
S. Augustyn also affyrmeth
And to Bonyface writes
Christ's body and blood to be Augu. in libro. ii. de doctri na christiana

Celebrated but under
A shadow and figure
Of a secret mysterye
So that this holy mysterye
Of christ's blood and body
It is spiritual in operacion
For it gives life ^y faith
Thus S. Augustyn says
And of his death a representacion
For to make relation s. ysodore in his book of true signification of words
says

Of the true signification
This is his saying
He says a sacrifice plainly
Is a thing done which is holy
Or a holy thing in doyinge
For by a word mystical
It is consecrate in the memorial
Of the Lords death and passion
And to be called the body
And blood of Christ verily.
This is his declaration
Though it be made he says
Of the fruytes of the earth
Yet is it made and sanctified
A sacrament by work inuysyble
Of the holy ghost incomprehensible
When that the word is pronounced
The Grecians they do call
This sacrament eucharistia all
That is by interpretacion
Good grace, as nothing more holy
then Christ's blood and body
Fyguted in this celebracion
This bread and wine mystically
Be compared unto the blood and body
Of Christ, because the inuysyble
Substance, of wine and bread
Does inebriate norryshe and fead
The externe man corruptyble
By the word of god believed
Is that lively bread fygured
By his participation
which does the minds recreate
And the faithful renouate
To the memorial of his passion
This he says that a mysterye
Is the signification and certentye
Of a seerete hid disposycion
So that a deuyne virtue
Does inwardly therein insewe
By that visible operacion
Thus declares he in soome
that the Lords death and passion
was ones done for all
So that the remembrance of it
Is represented to us yet
In this holy thing sole mpnisal
S. Ambrose writing of this mystery S. ambro(...)

Of Christ's blood and body
Says there is a commutacion
which is maruelously wroughte
Saying that it is brought
to an incomprehensyble alteracion
Now here says he let them
the which does not esteem
This secret virtue so hyd
But think that the hole body
to appear therein visibly
And to carnally presented
Think in what point and how
Here happens let them say now
Any soche holy commutacion
For bread and wine we find
which still appear in kind
Before and after consecracion
Therefore it is made internly
By power of gods spirit verily
which only faith looks upon
that which the soul fedeth
And everlasting life mynistreth
Is believed in that mutacion
Wherefore if ye say I see
Christ's body and blood to be
In order of nature here
You could not then say
I believe the body and blood allwaye
Of Christ for to be there
Than for asmoche as faith
Looks upon the hole he says
And the flesh apprehends nothing
So that the body and blood of Jesus
Be not in the form but in virtue
Of that sacramental ministering
Affyrmynge also the ministry such
Which is done in the church
To be but a sacrament memorial
Of that flesh wherein christ suffered
And was crucified dead and buried
Which was very flesh natural
But this flesh says he
In symilitude contained to be
Of that very flesh in mysterye
Yet is it not flesh in kind
Nor in form we find
But in sacrament verily
Yet in this sacrament Christ is
But yet he says not this
That wine and bread is his body
For then Christ must pronounciat
His body for to be corporat
And subject to mortalitye
For what soever is perceived
And in meat corporly tasted
That is subject to corruption
But here it is spiritual
And not tasted corporal
This is saynet Ambrose conclusion
Can then the word said
Transform the bread
Into flesh natural
Then must it be
That we should see
A body anymall
For and if it turn
From the fryste form
Of bread and wine
Then must the body
Appear to us openly
Before every man's eyes
If when a thing
Is brought from his being
And actually changed
Into that which
Has been none such
Neades must be perceived
A^ when qualities be altered
As blake to white changed
By words of consecracion
So changed in colloure
Sight taste and sauoure
Then is transubstaunciacion
But in this permutacion
Is made no innouacion
Then in the first certeigne
For that kind of creature
Which was their before
Is known still to remeigne
Now if we find
No change in kind
But as it was before
How now let us see
Than can it be
That bread remains no more
For it can be no sacrament
If the body be present
that the which it does figure
S. Augustyn he says
we apprehende by faith
that mystical nature
Other else it is plain
Our faith to be vapne
If reason have experience
therefore the verity
Calls it a mysterye
Of a deuyne enfluence
So that this holy sacrament
By old fathers judgment
Is but a mysterye hyd
As there is in baptysme
Doctors does defyne
A promise thereto annixed
Christ's flesh and blood he says
Is understand two manner of ways S. Hiero in his comentary of paul's Epist
les to ye Ephe*

Making thereof a distinction
Betwext the body and blood
that suffered death upon the rode
And yt which we receive to our salvation
For that flesh and blood he says
which the faithful receive in faith
Is of a spiritual enfluence
From that flesh which was crucified
And blood which on the cross was shed
He puts a full great difference
As may be between things spiritual
And things visible and corporal
So much they dyffer undoubtedly
From that flesh which was crucified
And that blood the which was shead
this doctor affirms plainly
For they be not all one says he
For that Crucified flesh pardy
was made of the flesh of a vyrgyn
Compact of bones synewes and vain
with ye liniame^ts of ma^s members plain
And quyckened with the spirit deuyne
Having also a reasonable soul
thus the proper mocio^s he does exstole Spiritus ante faciam nostram christ's
dominus.

Of his natural fleshly body
but this flesh which fedeth ye faithful
Has his form of corn fruitful
And is eaten of them spiritually
Yet this body we do understand
Is made by an artificers hand
without any reasonable substance
Co^pact with nether synewes nor fingers
distinct with no variety of members
nor able to exercise any proper puissau^ce
But what substance soever gives life
parteyneth to a spirit intelectyfe
which works an invisible efficacye
Now this is clean an other thing
which externally is perceived be seeing
From that believed in the misterye
Thus S. ambrose makes distinction
Between christ's flesh and the cm^unyo^
As here I have declared
If ye doubt look in his comentarye
Then shall ye se if I do varye
From his sentences before resyted
Now S. augustyn says plainly
Where as he spoke of his body Augu in sermon ad intantes. xix Qua^do
loquebatur dn^s nr^ Jesus christus de corpo re suo etc

It was a spiritual understanding
For it saves him that believes
where as the letter kylleth
But the spirit quyckeneth all thing.
Where christ says except ye eat
My flesh which is very meat
Ye shall have no life in you
It seamethe here says he
To command a thing to be
Foul wicked and untrue
By these words ye shall know
that christ meant it not so
to give his flesh to be eat
with your tethe, but this understand
to heauyn whole he shall assende
Up to his fathers seat
Now sith he it called
to be a foul thing and a wicked
to eat his flesh natural
you may perceive plainly
For to eat his body
were wicked and brutall
Seeing his body is flesh in deed
then consequently must proceed
to take and eat must be taken
But spoken mere spiritually
Or else this is my body
Must be figuratyuely spoken
Now he that abides not in me
And in whom I abide not says he
Let him not say nor think
that he does eat
My body as meat
Nether yet my blood do the drink
Christ says they bide not in me Aug. deciuitate dei libro xxi.

Nor yet they my members be
Which does them selves blote
In fylthynes being unclean
For then do they remain
the members of an harlote
S. augustyn and venerable bede s. Augu. and bed super. Corint. vi. et. 1. cor.
x. Idem Cori. xi.

says the unfaithful and wicked
Which be not members to christ our brother
they do not eat his body
Nor drink his blood verily
yet eat they the sacrament as well as the other
Therefore ye must of necessite
Grant the sacrament not to be
Christ's body natural
But a figure and token
Of his body once broken
Thereof to be a memorial
Thus S. Augustyne does deny Roma. v

That we eat not his natural body
Wherefore it must neades insewe
Yt is but a mistacall figure
Thus he approuethe by the scripture
Representyng his passion new
And also Bead that worthy priest bed super cori. 1. ^. x. chapt.

Says he eats not Christ
Which is wicked in his living
Nor yet drinks his blood
Nether his flesh does him no good
Though he receive so worthy a thing
If this be not true ye must deface
Saynet Augustyn in this place
And not to be approved
A holy doctor of the church.
But I trust their be none such
That with him wylbe offended
Now where he is almyghtye
No man will that deny
But he may do what he list
At his good pleasure all thing
Because their is no superior power being
Hable his might to resist
Yet all think he cannot do Paul and eustochius*

S. Hierome and S. Thomas says so
Writing of virginytie
He cannot sin says Dunce at all
He cannot deny him self says Paul
In his Epistle unto Timothy
I think yet god by his sons blood
Might have saved all men bad and good Iho^. iii.

If he had so intended
But the scriptures thus standinge (prosper ^ lib. sente^ciatu^. crisostim
super mat. et ad hebre ho. xvii. Eusebius qia corpus etc. tertulia^ lib. ii et.
li. iiii ad mercione fulge^tius. ii li. de fide bartram ad carelos empe ratur
Cyprian ad cecilium Athana. iii. li q^ dix ver also dru thm arius says hoc est
corpus meum in misterio

He cannot now do that thing
And if he were so minded
Then his word he must forsake
And his son a liar make
For he says the unfaithful is dampened
Nor the unbelievers shall no life se
But gods wrath is upon them says he
Could they then have been saved
Now here for to conclude
I trust no man is so rude
To construe any thing amiss
Which plainly devulgate
And also truly insinuate
What these Doctors iuogementes is.
For seeing they do it call
The Sacrament of a figure mystical
Of Christ's blood and body
They ought to be believed
By cause their doctrine is received
Of the Catholic church verily
(Now because ye shall find
More Doctors of that mind
Which has written manyfestlye
As prosper, crisostim, Eusebius and Tertulia^
Fulgentius, athanasius Bartra^ and Ciprian
Al these declare it to be a mystery
Therefore all those which be anointed
And by gods holy spirit appointed
Judge you here now indifferently
Whether these fathers doctrine
And the papisticall leven
To be believed is most worthy
