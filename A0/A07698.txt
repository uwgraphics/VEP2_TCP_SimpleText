A dyaloge of sir Thomas More knight: one of the counsayll of our sovereign
lord the king and chancellor of his duchy of Lancaster. wherein be treatyd
diverse matters / as of the veneration and worship of ymagys and relyques /
prayng to sayntys / and going o^ pilgrimage. with many othere thyngys touching
the pestylent sect of Luther and Tyndale / by the tone bygone in Saxony / and
by the the other laboryd to be brought in to England

The preface
Hit is a^ old said saw / that one bysynes bygettyth and brings forth a
another. which proverb as hit happeth I find very true by my self / which
have been feign by occasyo^ first of one busygnes a^^er to take the second /
and upon the second now to take y^ third. For where as a right worshyp^ull
fre^d of mine sent any unto me a secret sure friend of his with certain
credence to be declared unto me / towchyng many such matters as being in deed
very certain and owte of doubt / be nethelesse of late by lewd people put in
questy on / the specyaltees whereof do so ferforth in the furst chapyter of
this book appear / that we shall here need no rehersall thereof / I thought yt
first Enough to tell ye messe^ger my mind by mouth / acco^ptyng yt after our
co^munycacyon ended / I should never need ferther busynes therein. But after that
the messenger was departed / and I felt my stomach well eased / in yt I
rekened all my labor done / by thynkyng my self a little while thereon / my
busynes that I took for fynyshed I fo^nd very far fro that point and little
more than bygonne. For when I consydred what y^ matters were / and how many
great thingys had been treated between the messenger and me / and in what
manner fashyone / albe it I mystrustyd not his good will / and very well
trustede his wit / his lernyng / well seruyng him to the perseuyng and
reportyng of our co^munycacyon / yet fyndyng our treatye so diverse and so
long / and sumetyme such wise intrycate that my self could not without labor
call it orderly to mind / me thought I had not well done without writing to
trust his only memory / namely since sum parts of the matter be such of them
self as rather need to be attentely read and aduysed / tha^ houerly hard and
passyd over. And over this I co^sidred yt though I nothing suspecte the
messenger / as in good faith I do not / and to say ye truth am of my self
so little mystrustyng / that he were ^^ke very pl^ynly to show him self naught
whom I should take for badde / yet since no man ca^ look in to a nothers breast
/ as yt is therefore well done to deem the best / so were yt not mich amysse in
sych wise to provide for the worste / as (if a man hap to be worse tha^ we
take him for) our good opinion turn us to none harm. For this cause me
thought that for ye more suertye my part were to send our co^munycacyon to my
said friend in writing. whereby if yt had happed yt his messenger had for any
synyster fauou^ borne toward the wrong side purposely mangled ye matter / his
master should not only know the treuth / but also have occacyon the better be
ware of his messe^ger / which else might hape to hurt while he were mystake^
for good. Now when I had upon this delyberacyon taken with my self / written
all ye matter and sent hit to my friend / than had I me thought all done and my
mind full set at rest. But that rest rested not long. For sone after was yt
showed me that of my writing were written diverse copies / And one also carried
over ye se. where when I remembered what a shrewd sort of our apostatas are
asse^blede / part ro^ne owte of religyon / and all ro^ne owte of the right
faith / me thought great parell might arise if su^ of that cumpany which are
confedered and co^spyred to gether in the sow^ynge and setting forth of
Luthers pestylent he resyes in this realm / should maliciously change my
wordys to ye worse / and so put in prent my book framed after their fantesye.
which when I would afterward reprove and show ye difference / I might
peradventure seem for the color of my cause to have amendede mine own upon
the sight of theyrs. For eschewyng whereof I a^now dreuen as I say to this
third busynes of publyshyng and putting my book in prynt my self. whereby
their e^trepryse if they should any such intend / shall I trust be prevented and
frustrate. And this have I done not all of mine own head / but after the
counsel of other mo tha^ one. whose aduyce and counsel for their wisdom
and lernyng I asked in that byhalf / and which have at my request vouchesaufed
to read over ye book ere I did put yt forth. For albeit that I dare be su^what
bold to common in famylyer manner with such as for their fantesye like to ask me
of such matters any questyon according to ye counceyle of saint Poule / bidding
us be ready to give a rekenyng and to show a reasonable cause to every man of ye
faith and hope that we have / yet to make and put forth any book wherein were
tretyd any such thyngys as to which our faith / would I not presume but if better
learned than my self should think yt either profitable or at the lestwyse
harmlese. To whose examinacion and judgment I did the more studyously submyte
this work for two things in special among diverse other. The one for the
lyberall allegacyons of the messenger for the wrong part so laid out at large
/ that of my self I stood half in a dowt whyther yt were co^uenyent to
rehearse the wordys of any man so ho^ly and in manner sumtyme irreverently spoken
against goddis holy halows and their reuerente memoryes. The the other was
certain taly^ and merry words which he mynglid with his matter / and su^ such
on mine own part among as occasyon ^ell in co^munycacyon. In which albe yt I
saw none harm / yet sumwhat dowted I lest they should unto sadd men seem over
light and wa^ton for the wayght and grauyte of such an erenest matter. wherefore
in these two poyntys though I hade all ready seen some e^sa^ples of right holy
me^ / which in their bokys answeryng to thobieccions of heretics in their
time have not let to rehearse the very formal wordys of them whose
wryti^gis they made answer to / being sometime of such manner and sort as a
good man would not well bear / and have not also let to write a merry word in
a right ernest work / of which two things I could owte of godly mennys bokis
and holy sayntys workys gether a good sort / yet in mine own work I
determined that I would nothing allow nor defend that the judgment of other
virtuous and cunning men would in any wise mysse like. And therefore after yt
such had red hit and severally said their aduyce / I found as hit often
happith / that sum thing which one wise and well lernyd manne would have owte
/ twain of like wisdom and lernyng specially would have in / neither side
lackyng good and probable reaso^e for their part. wherefore sith hit bycame
not me to be judge over the judgment of them whom I took and chose for my
judges / being such of them self as hard were yt for any man to say which of
them before the other he could in erudyc^on wytt or prudence any thing
prefer / I could no ferther goo but lene to the more part. which I so
ferforth have followed / that like wise as I diverse thyngys put owte or
changed by their good aduyce and counsel / so let I nothing stand in this
book / but such as twain aduysyd me specially to let stand / against any one
that any dowt mouyd me to the contrary. And thus much have I thought necessary
for my declaracyon and excuse to aduertyse you all that shall happen to read
this rude simple work / prayeng you of pacyence and pardon / whom god of his
especyall grace grant as much profit in ye redyng / as my pore heart has
mente you and e^tendede in ye making.

The furst chapyter
The letter of credence sent from his friend by a trusty secret messenger^ with
the letter of ye authore answeryng ye same. The declara^yo^ of of ye credence
by the mouth of ye messenger whereupon the matter of all the hole work
depends.

The letter of credence
MAster chauncelour as heartily as I possible ca^ I recomend me to you. Not
without a thousand thankys for your good cumpany when we were last to gether.
In which for as myche as yt liked you to spend sum of your time with me in
famylyer co^munycacion / whereof sum perte I trust so to remember as my self
shall be the better and some other never the worse / which shall have cause and
have all ready to give you great thank therefore / I am bold at this time to
send you my special secret friend this berer to break with you su^what
ferther / partly of ye same matters partly of su^ other such as are happed
there synnys / whereof great spech and rumor runs here / whereby ye shall
have occasyo^ more at length if your leysour will serve to touch certain
dowtes moved sins of the matters treated between us before. wheri^ were it not
for your other busynes I would be hold on your goodness to desire you to take
good time (...) him. And yet neuere the less do require you heartily as your
leysour will serve you to satysfy him at the the full. For he shall how long
so ever he tarry therefore / give attendaunce unto you days and hours as ye
may spare him time. which can not in these things be but well bestowed /
considering that the matters be such and so to wchynge to god / as they were
well worthy to set worldly busynes aside specially i^ such need. For I assure
you so^ folk here tal^ very straungely of the thyngys that he shall move you /
Not only for such wordis as they tell yt come from thense / but also most
especially thorough tho^casyon of some letters lewdely written hither owte of
london by a pressed or t^^ whom they take here for honest. But what so ever any
man tell or write / I shall for ye confydence and trust yt I have in you
surely take and tell forth for the very truth what so ever ye shall afferme unto
my friend / who^ I send unto you not so myche because I may not come my self
(how beyt therefore to) as for because I long to have him talk with you. To whom
what so ever ye say reken yt said to my self / Not only for his troth and
secretnes / but also for his memory. with whom to common I trust shall not
mislyke you. For either mine affeccyo^ blyndeth me / or ye shall find him wise
/ and as other say that can better judge yt the^ I / more the^ mea^ly lernyd /
with one thing addede wherewyth ye be wont well to be content / a very merry
wit. He is of naturre nothing tongue tayed. And I have in these matters beden
him be bold with out any straynynge of curtesye / whereof the cerymonyes in
dysputacyo^ marryth much of ye matter / while one studyeth more how he may
behave him than what he shall say. I have I say therefore boden him more to
mind his matter the^ his curtesy / ^ freely to lay forth not only what he
thi^keth / but also what him list / geuyng no foot in dysputing unto your
authorytye but if he be born bak with reason. Thus may ye se I am bold o^ your
goodness to put you to labor and busynes / and send one to face you in your
own house. But so much am y^ I bolder / for that in such chale^ges I know you
for a ready and sure defender. And of such labor your wysdom wel^ sees that
god is ye rewarder / who long preserve you and all yours.

The lettre of the author sent with the book.
Right worshypfull sir after most hearty reco^mendacyon / albe yt yt of late I
sent you my pore mind by ye mouth of your trusty friend / to who^ ye desired me
by your letters to give no less credence than to your self / concerning all
such thyngys as he brake of and co^muned with me in your bihalfe / and yt for ye
co^fydence yt ye have i^ him / ye wit and lernyng yt I found in him / and
honestye yt I so much ye more thynk him to be of / in yt I perceive you being
of such wysedom and virtue / to have him in so speryall trust / I nether do nor
ca^ believe ye contrary but yt he has of all our co^munycacyo^ made you
faithfully / plain / and full report / yet sithe I suppose in my self yt if
we had might co^uenye^tly cum to gether ye would rather have chosi^ to have
hard my mind of mine own mouth tha^ by ye mean of a another / I have si^nis i^
these few days in which I have be^ at home put ye matter in writing / to the end
ye may not only here hit by the mouth of your friend / but also which better is
than suddenly ones to here hit of mine own mouth / read yt if ye list more
often at your best leisure advysydly from mine own pen. which thing I
verily thought my self so much the more bound to do / for that yt lyked you
of your special favor and affeccyo^ toward me so greatly to regard and
esteem my myn^ and answer i^ those matters / yt no rumor there ru^ni^g or
talys in your country told or leters thither written nor reasons or arguments
there made to the contrary / should let or with ^^ande but that ye would as ye
wrote take that thing for undoubted troth yt I should by your frended acertayn
you. And surely sir i^ thus poi^t ye may make your self sure yt I shall never
wyllingly deceue your trust. And lest I might hap to do yt of over sight
unware / albe yt I nothing said unto your friend by mouth but that I was
right well enformyd of the troth / yet for as mich as I perceived by him ye
su^ ^olke dowted le^te many thyngys were laid to the charge / not only of that
man ye wrote of / but also of Luther him self / otherwise than coud be proved
/ I did so much therein that I was suffered to se and show him as well ye bokys
of ye tone as the very a^tys of ye court concerning yt the other / yt we might
both by so myche the more surely wartau^t you ye troth. wherein if ye find any
man y^ yet dowteth whether he told you and I write you the troth or not / I
shall if he understand the laryne tongue find ye mean at your pleasure that he
shall so see the bokys him self / yt were he never so full of mystrustynge he
shall not fail to be fully content and satysfyed. And this warra^tyse will I
make you as farforth as con^erneth any act done here. But as for thyngys
reasoned and dysputed between us / ye co^clusyons self be so sure truths / yt
the^ be not dysputable. But whither the reasons by me made in the^
be^effectuall or insufficye^t / albe it your friend either for y^^ of troth he
thought so / or for that of curtesye he said so / accepted them for good / yet
wthout preiudyce of ye pri^cipall matters ye may your self be judge. And thus I
pray you take in good worth ye little labor and great good will of him whom
in any thing yt may do you pleasure / ye may to the uttermost of his little
power well and boldly commau^d. And thus our lord send you with my good lady
your bedfelow and all yours as heartily well to fare as ye would all wysh.

yOur friend first after your letter read / when I demanded him his credence
/ showed me that ye had sent him to me / not for any dowte that your self had
in many of those thingis that he should move unto me / but for the dowte that ye
perceived in many other / and i^ sum folk plain parsuasyo^ to y^e contrary /
whom ye would be glad to answer with the truth / albe yt some thyngys he
said were also there so talked / that ye wist not well your self which part ye
might bileue. For it was there not only spoken but also thither written by
diverse honest pre^^ys owte of london / yt the man ye write of was of many
thyngys bor^e wrong in hand / and therein so sore handelyd / that he was forced
to forswere and ab^ure certain herysyes / and openly put to penance therefore /
where he neuere held any such. And all this don for malice and envy / partly
of some freres against whose abusyons he preched / partly for yt he preched
boldly against the pomp and pride and other inordynate living that mo men
speak of th^^ preche of used in the clargye. And they take for a great tokyn
that he should not mean evil / the prose and experyence which men have had of
him yt he lived well and was a good honest virtuous man far from ambycyon
and desire of wordly worship / chaste / humble and charytable / free and
lyberall in almose deed / and a very goodly prechour / in whose deuowte sermons
ye people were greatly edyfyed. And therefore ye people say yt all this gere is
done but only to stop me^nys mouthys / and to put every man to silence yt
would any thing speak of the ^autys of the clargy. And they thynk yt for none
other cause was also burned at Poulys cross the new testament late traunslated
in e^glyshe by Master wyllyam huchen otherwise called Master Ti^dall / who was
as me^ say well known ere he went over the sea for a man of right good living
/ studyouse and well learned in scripture / and in diverse pl^cys in England
was very well lyked and did great good with prechyng. And men mutter among
the^ self that the book was not only fawtlesse / but also very well
traunslatyd / and was deuyse^^ to be burned because me^ should not be able to
prove yt such fawtys as were at Poules cross declared to have be^ fou^den in
it were never fou^de^ there i^ deed / but untruly surmised. And yet such as they
were sum men say were no fautis at all / if they had be so translated i^ deed /
but blame laid and ^awte found with things nothing (...) worthy / only to
^^face ye holy work / to the end yt they might seem to have some just cause to
burn yt. And yt for none other cause but for to keep out of ye peples hand is
all knowledge of Cristes gospel and of goddis law / except so much only as ye
clargye the^ self list now and tha^ to tell us. And that little as it is and
seldom showed / yet as it is fered not well and truly told / but watered with
false gloses / and altered from the truth of ye very wordis and sentence of
scriptur only for ye mayntenau^s of their authoryte. And y^^ fere lest this
thing should euydentely appear to the people if they were suffered to read ye
scripture the^ self in their own tongue / was as yt is thought ye very cause not
only for which ye new testament translated by Ti^dale was burned / but also yt
ye clargye of this realm has before this time by a co^stitucion prouyncyall
prohybyted any book of scripture to be traunslated in to the englysh tongue /
ferynge men with fire as herytyques whose so should presume to keep the^ / As
though yt were heresy for a chryste^ man to read crystes gospel. And surely
sir quod he sum folk yt thynk this dealyng of the clargye to be thus / and
good men to be myshandlyd for declaryng the troth / And the scripture self to
be pulled owte of ye peples handys lest they should perceive the truth / be
led in their myndys to dowte whither Luther hi^ self of whose opinions or at
the least of whose workys all these bysynesse bygan / wrote in deed so evil as
he is borne in hand. And many men therbe that think he never mente such
thingis. But that because he wrote against thabusyons of pardons / and spoke
su^what lyberally against the court of Rome / and generally against the
vycys of the clargy / therefore he was brought i^ hatered / and first cyted to
Rome. And when yt forfere of bodily harm with wrong / whereof yt would have
been to late or look for remedy after / if he had ones be burnede up before /
he durst not come thither / than was he accursed / and his books dampened / and
under great paynis forbodden to be redd. And that thing done / because it
should not be known what wrong he had / and yt he neither means nor says
such odyouse and abomynable heresies as the people be borne in hand to enduce
them to hatered of hi^ / as yt would peraue^ture appear y^ his b^kis were
suffered to be read. And they sey that yt were no mastry to make yt seem that
a man should be a^ herytyque / if he may be borne in hand that he says the
thing which he never said / or peradventure one line taken out among meny and
mysco^strewed / not suffering the remnante to be seen / whereby yt might more
clearly appear what he meanyth. By which manner of delynge a man they say might
lay heresye to saint poule / and find a fault i^ saint John's gospel. And yet
they say the worst of all is this / that the clargye c^ace not hereby nor hold
them self content with the co^dempnyng of Luther and forbyddyng of his books /
but ferther abuse ye hatered of his name against every man that is in
prechynge of the word of god any thing such as he should be / that is to wyit
plain and bold without gloss or flateryng. where if they find a man fauty /
let them lay his fawte to his charge. what nedythe to call him a Lutherane?
Though Luther were a devil yet might a man percase say as he says in sum
thing and say true Enough. For never was there herytyqu^ that said all false.
Nor the devil him self lied not when he called Christ goddys son. And
therefore men think that this name (...) Lutherane seruethe the clargye for a
common cloak of a false crune / yt where they lack special matter to charge one
with by judgment / they labor to bring him first in the infamy of that name
that co^prysyth as they make it seem / a confuted hepe of heresies no man ca^
tell what. And yet in such deling they wound their own matter a another way.
For while they de^^ame for Lutherany^/m^ that be of known virtue and cu^ni^g /
what do they thereby but o^e of ye twayn either cause the people yt have for good
living and lernyng those me^ in great reputacyon to think yt the clargye for
malice and envy does untruly defame them / or else that Luthers doctrine is good
/ while so cu^nyng men and good men lene thereto. And therefore yt were wisdom
not to call them Lutheranys / but rather when they teache and hold any such
opynions as the people know for Luthers / let yt either be dy^symuled / or they
secretly by fair ways enduced to the contrary / if the points that they teache
of his be naught. Lest by calling good and cunning me^ Lutherane / they may
peradventure bring them self in suspycyone of malice and ^nuye / And Luther
among the people into good opynyo^ / Thynkyng as they bygynne to do all ready /
that eythere Luther said not so evil as is surmysed upon him / or else that
those things yt he says as odious as they seem / be good enough in deed. He
said also yt yt seemed unto many men a sore thing and far unreasonable / that
pore simple and unlearned men all though they fell in to errors and were led
out of the right way by yt they lened to thauthoryte of such me^ as they
byleued to be virtuous and ^u^nyng / should instead of teching be bete^
cruelly with abiuracyons and opyn shame / with perell of burning also / if a
few false witness shall after such abiuracyo^ depose yt they have hard him
fall in relapse. Finally he said yt many good and well lernyd men thought
plainly that ye clargye semyth far out of all good order of cheryte / and
that they do contrary to the myldnesse and merciful mind of their ma^^er /
and against the^sample of all the old holy fathers / in yt they cause for any
error or wrong opynion in the faith / any man one or other to be put to death.

For they say that ye old holy fathers used only to dyspute with heritiques /
techyng them and conuyctynge them by scripture / and not by fagottes. And that
by that way the faith went well forward / and one heritique so turnyd did
torn many othere / where as now me^ abhor this cruelty in the church. And
they that seem turned / think still the things that they dare not say. And of
thasshes of one herytyke spryng up many. And that now we make the fassyon of
crystendom to seem all turned quyte up so down. For where as Crist made
infydelis the persequutours and his cryste^ people the su^^rers / we make the
christen men the persecutours and the infydelys the sufferers. whereby me^
think that secretly Christys order yet stands still though yt be not so
t^kin and so perceived. For the people take yt that still those that persequute
be ye myscrea^^tys / and those pore people yt suffer yt / be under the false
name of heretyques the true byleuyng men and very christen martyrs.

Christ also they sey would never have any man compelled by force and vyole^ce to
believe upon his faith / nor would that men should fight for him or his matters.
In so farforthe yt he would not suffer ^aynt peter to fight for his own self /
but repreuyd him for strykynge Malchus. Nor would not defend hi^ self / but
helyng the ere again of Malchus his persecutour which Peter had smitten of /
and geuyng all his holy body to the pacyent sufferau^ce of all paynefull
turmentys that his cruel enmyes would put to it / showed us as well by his
effectual ensaumple of his death / as by his godly counceyle in his life / and
after that confyrmed by the contynuall pa^syo^ and marterdums of his holy
martyrs / that his will and pleasure is that we should not so myche as defend
our self against herytyquys and infidelys / were they paganys turkys or
sarasinys. And mich less tha^ should we fight against them and kill the^ / but
that we should persevere in setting forth his faith against myscreauntis and
infidellys / by such ways as him self began it / keep it / and encreace it
as it was gotten / And that was by pacyence and su^^^raunce by which the faith
was dyuulgate and sprede almost through the world in little while. Not by war
and fyghting / which way has as they say well nere all ready lost all that the
the other way wanne.

when your friend had thus declared his crede^s / he desired me both o^ your
byhalfe and on his own in such thingys as were parcas not well said to take
the^ as they were i^ deed the mind of other / whom ye would feign answer and
satysfye with resone / which ye trustyd to be the better able to do by mine
answer / and neither the mind nor opinion of you nor him / which did and would
in all thing stand and abide by the faith and believe of Crystes catholyk
church. But as for such pertys of this matter as concernyd not any part of
our believe but the deali^g of this world / as the justice or vniustyce of sum
spyrytuall personys in the pursuyng and condempnyng me^ for heretyquys or their
werkys for heresies / he thought he said as of him self that me^ might wtoute
any parell of heresy for their own part notwtstandyng any man's judgment
geuin yet well and resonably dowt there in / For though he thought it heresy to
think thopynyons of any man to be good and catholyque which be^ herisyes in
deed / yet might a man he thought without any parell of heresy dowte whether he
were a^ herytyke or no that were by mannys judgment condemned for one / sith
it might well happen that he never held those opinions that were put upon him
/ but that he was either by falls deposycyons of wrong full wytnes / or by the
error or malice of unjust judges condempnyd. And that sometime percase the
ignorance of some judges would condemn for heresye such artycles as wyser and
better lernyd would in point of judgment allow for good and catholyque / and of
the the other judgment decerne and judge the contrary.

How be yt he said that ye had i^ me and my lernyng so special trust and
co^fydens / that in any of all these thi^gys what so ever ye had herd or should
here ellis where / ye were fully determynyd to give full crede^ce to me and
take for ye troth such answer as he should bring you from me / wherei^ ye
right heartily desired me to take some pain that ye might in these matters by
his mouth know my mind at large /

After this or I made any a^swere to his wordys / I demanded him what manner
acquayntaunce was between him and you. And theruppon perceyuyng him to have
your sons at scole enqueryng farther of him to what faculte he had most geuyn
his study / understood him to have geuyn dylyge^ce to the latin tongue / As for
other facultyes he rought not of. For he told me merrily that Logyk he rekenyd
but babelyng / Musyke to serve for syngers / Arythmetryk mete for merchau^tes /
Geometry for masons / Astronomy good for no man / And as for Philosophy ye most
vanyte of all / And that yt and Logyk had lost all good deuynyte with ye
subteltyes of their questyons / and babelyng of their dyspycyons / Byldyng
all upon reason / which rather geuith blyndnes tha^ any light. For man he said
has no light but of holy scripture. And therefore he said that biside the
latyne tongue he had been / which I much commend / studiouse in holy scripture /
which was he said lernyng I nough for a Crystyn man / with which thapposteles
held the^ self content. And therein he said he labored not only to can many
textys thereof by heart / but also to enserche the sentence and understanding
thereof as far as he might perceive by him self. For as for interpretours he
told me that neither his time would well serve him to read / and also he
found so great swetnes in the text self / that he could not find in his
heart to lose any time in the glosi^. And as towchyng any defycultye he said
that he found by experience that the best and surest interpretacio^ was to
ley and confer one text with an other / which ^ayle not among them well
and sufficiently to declare them self. And this way he said that he vsyde
which he found sufficient and surest. For so should it most surely tarry / when
yt were founden owte and lernyd by a man's own labor. And that he said was
every man able Enough to do with help of god which never faylith them that
faithfully trust in his promise. And he has promysid that if we seek we shall
find / And if we knock we shall have it openyde to us. And what shall be
openid? but y^ book which as saint Ioh^n says i^ thapocalips is so shytt
with.vii. clapses that it can not be opened but by the lamb that when he
shetteth then ca^ no man open it / and when he openyth it than can no man shytt
it. Uppo^ these wordys and other like when I consyderyde that your friend was
studiouse of scripture / and all though I now have a very good opinion of him
/ nor at that time hade not all the contrary / yet to be plain with you and him
both / by reason that he set the matter so well and lustely forward / he put me
somewhat in dowte whether he were as young scolers be su^time prone to new
fantesyes / fallen in to luthers sect. And that ye peradventure su^what feryng
the same / did of good mind the rather send him to me with such a message /
for that ye trustyd he should be sumwhat a^swered and satysfied by me. I
therefore thought it not metely i^ so many matters and wegh^y to make him an
unadvised answer / but with good wordys welcomyng him for the time pte^dyng
lake of leysour for other psent bisines / required him to return on the morrow
/ Against which time I would so order mine other affares that we would have
conference to gether of all his erande at length. And he in this wise being
departyde I began to gather in mind the hole effect as my rememberaunce
would serve me of all that he had purposyd. And because I would have yt the
more ready at mine eye / so that I might the more fully and effectually answer
it leuyng no part vntouchyd in such order as he hade purposyd yt that is to
wytt after the manner that I have above rehersyd / I bryefely commyttyd yt to
writing

The second chapyter
Here su^maryly is declared what order the Author intendyth to trete of the
matters purposyd unto him. whereof because the first was an oppynyon conceived
in some mennys heddes that a certain parso^late abiured of heresy for preching
against pilgrymagys and ymagis and prayers made to saints was therein greatly
wronged / ye author breuely declares his mind concerning the confutacyon of
those perylouse and pernycyouse opy^yons.

ON y^ morrow when he was cu^men again sumwhat before vii. of the clock (for
so I appointed him) taking him with me in to my stody / and my saruantys warned
that if any other should happen to desire to speak with me / certain except
of whom I gave them knowledge / they should dy^^erre them till a another
leysor / I set him down with me at a little table. And then I showed unto him
that where he had purposed on your byhalf in short wordys many long things
whereof the rehersall were loss of time to him that so well knew them all ready
/ I would all super^iuous recapytulacyon set aparte / as brefely as I
conuenyently could / show him my mind in them all. And first bygyn where he
bygan at the abiuracyon of the man he spoke. Secu^dly would I touch the
condempnacyon and burning of ye new testament traunslated by Tyndale. Thyrdly
sumwhat would I speak of Luther and his sect in general. Forthly and finally
ye thing that he touched last that is to wytt y^ wart and fyghtyng against
infydelys with the condemnacyo^ of heretyques unto death / which two poynty^
him self had combyned and knytte to gether. And first as touching the matter of
the man's ab^^racyon where it is reported that the spyrytualtye did him wrong.
And for to make that seem lykly there is laid in them displeasure / malice
and ^^^y toward him ^or peech^ng as ye say quod I against theyer vycyouse
living / And in him is on the the other side alegyd myche connyng virtue and
goodness. I will neither enter in to the praise of them nor in to the dyspreyse
of him / wherein standyth nothing theffecte of this matter / For if the^e did /
I would not pass over su^ part thereof so shortly.

But now for this matter all though the hole spyrytualtye / wherein no man
dowtith to be ^ ^any a right virtuous and godly man / were in their living
far wors than deuylles / yet if they did that man no wrong / there has for
this matter no man against them any cause to co^playn. And over this if that man
were in all his other living as innocent as a saint / yet if he were infected
and fautye in these herysyes / he had than in this matter no wrong. And yet
beside all this if he not only were in all other things very virtuous / but
also were of all thoese heresies whereof he was detected utterly clean and
fautles / yet if it were by suffycyent wytnes / were they never so falls in deed
/ seming honest and lykely to say true / prouyd in opyn court that he was
fauty there in / albeyt in such case his wytnessys had wronged him / yet had
his judges done him but right. And therefore letting pass as I say y^ praysse
or dysprayse of either his judges or him / as thyngys impertinent to y^ point /
I will show you yt they not only did him no wrong / but also showed him / in
my mind the gretest favor / And used toward him the most charytable ^^rcy yt
ever I wy^^ vsyd to any man in ^uch case. And first as for any wron^ yt his
iudgi^ did hy^/I mer^ell me (...) where in they that report yt could assygn^ it.
for if any were done him^it must n^^es have been in one of the two thyngys /
either in that he was untruly iudgyd to have pchyd such artycles as he was
detectyd of where he pchyd none such in deed / or else in that sum such
artycles as he preached were iudeged and condemned for heresies where they were
none in deed. Except that any man would say that though he were proved and
conuyctyd of heresye yet he should have been put to no penance at all or else
to no such as he was. And of that point if any man so thynk / I shall speak in
y^ fourth part where we shall towch in general the order that the church
takyth in the condemnacyon of herytyques. But as for the the other poyntys first
if any priest wrote owte of london in to your cuntraye that any such article of
his prechyng was by his iudeges declared for herysy as were in deed good and
not against the faith of crystys church / let him name what article / And
either ye shall find that he shall name you such as y^ man was not charged
with all / or else shall ye find yt such as he shall name you were such in
deed as your self shall pceyue for heresies at your ere / For y^ artycles
where with he was chargede were yt we should do no worship to any images / nor
pray to enyseyntys / or go on pylgrymagys / whyth thyngys I suppose every good
crystyn man will agree for heresies. And therefore we shall let that point pass
and so resort to the secund ^o se why^her it were well prouy^ that he preched
them or no. Sir quod your ^^end I would for my part well agree them for
^^rysys / but yet have I ha^^ some or thy^ that would not d^ so^ And therefore
w^an we ^all they^ herysye^ it were well (...) to tell why / ^ythse^^ men would
(I we^e if they might (...) hard) ^tyffly say nay / which now hold their
pease and bear them self full coldely that would take ye matter more hot save
for burni^g of their lyppys. Now forsooth quod I who so ever will say yt these
be no heresies / he shall not have me to dispute it which have no cunning in
such matters / but as it best becu^myth a ley man to do in all thyngys / lene
and cleue to the comem faith / and believe of crystes church. And thereby do I
plai^ly know it for an herysye / if an herysye be a sect and a side way takyn
by any part of such as been bap^ysyd and beat the name of crystyn men from the
come^ faith and byleefe of the hole church beside. For this am I very sure and
perceive it well not only by experyens of mine one time and the placys were my
self has been with commen report of other honest me^ from all other placys of
crystyndome / but by bokys also and rememberauncys left of long time with
writing of the old holy fathers and now sayntys in heuyn / that from
thappostles time hitherto this manner has been vsyd / taught and allowed / and
the contrary como^ly condenyd through ye hole flok of all good christian people.
And as touching such textes as these heretykys allege against the worshyppyng
of ymagys / prayeng to sayntys / and going o^ pylgrymages / as they ley the law
given to the Jews. Non facies tibi s^u^p^^e / ^how shall carue the none ymag^.
And the psalm. In e^i^u Israell^ de egipto / And s^l^ deo honor et gloria /
only to god be honor and glory. And ma^^ dictus ^ui co^fidit in homine.
Accursed is he that puts his trust in man with many such other like /
which herytyques have of old ever ha^ked against chrystys catholyk church /
very su^e am I yt saint Austen / saynt^ hierome / saint basyle / saint gregory
with so many a godly cunnyng man as has been in crystis church from ye begynyng
hitherto / understood those textes as well as did those heretyques / Namely
having as good wits / being far better lernid / using in stody more
diligence / being an hepe to an handful / and which most is of all having / as
god by many miracles beryth wytnes / beside their lernyng the light and
clerenes of his especyall grace / by which they were inwardly taught of his
only spyryt to perceive that the word is spokyn in the old law to the iewys
people prone to Idolatry / and yet not to all them nether / For the preestys
than had the ymagis of thangell cherubin in the secret place of the temple /
should have no place to forbid imagis among his christian flok / where his
pleasure would be to have ye image of his blessed body ha^gyng on his holy
cross / had in honor and reverent remembrance. where (...) would vouchsaufe
to send unto the king abiagarus the image of his own face / where he lykyd to
leave the holy vernacle thexpresse image also of his blessid vysage as a token
to remayn i^ honor among such as louyd him from ye time of his bitter passion
hitherto. which as it was by the miracle of his blessid holy hand expressed and
left i^ y^ sudari / so has yt been by like miracle in that thyn corruptyble
cloth kept and preseruyd uncorrupted this.xv.C. year fresh and well perceived
to ye i^warde cumfort / spyrytuall reioysyng and great encreace of feruoure and
devotion in the hearts of good christian people. Crist also taught his holy
euangelyst saint luke to have an another manner mind toward ymagis than have
these heretyques / when he put in his mind to counterfete and express in a
table the lovely vysage of our blessed lady his mother. He taught also saint
amphibalus the master and techer of the holy first martyr of england saint
albane to bear about and worship y^ crucyfyx. who showed also saint albane
him self in a vysyon ye image of ye crucyfyx but god: which thing wrought i^
that holy man so strongly / that he with few words of saint amphybalus at y^
sight of that blessed image which our lord had before shewid him i^ his sleep
was clean turned to chrystendome / And in the worshyping of y^ same image was
taken and brought forth to judgment and afterward to marterdome.

And there is no man but if he love a another he delitith i^ his image or
enythyng of his. And these heretyques yt be so sore against the ymagis of god
and his holy sayntis would be yet right angry with^^n yt would dishonestly handle
an image made in remembrance of hi^ self / where y^ wrethis forbere not
vilanously to handle and to cast dyrte in dispyte upon the holy crucyfyx
anymage made in remembrance of our savior him self / and not only of his
most blessed person but also of his most bitter passion.

Now as touching prayer made unto the sayntis and worship done unto them /
mich marvel is it what cause of malice these heretykes have to them. we se yt
commen in the wreched co^dycyon of this world that one man of a pride in him
self has envy at a another or for displasure done / beryth to some other malice
and evil will. But this must needs be a deuelish hatred to hate him whom thou
never knewist / which never did the harm / which if he could now do yt no good
where he is / yet either with his good ensample gone before the / or his good
doctrine left byhynde him / does the / but if thou be very naught of thy self
/ great good i^ this world for thy journey toward heuyn. And this must nedys be
an envy cu^myng of an hye deuelyshe pride and far passing thenuye of the devil
himself / for he never enuyed but such as he saw and was conuersaunt with / as
wha^ he saw man and the glory of god. But these herytyques envy them whom
they never saw nor never shall se but when they shall be sorry and ashamed in
them self of yt gloryouse sight / For where they pretend the zele of goddys
honor hi^ ^elf / as though god to who^ only all honor and glory is to be
given / were dyshonored in that sum honor is done to his holy sayntys / they
be not so mad nor so chyldyshe as they make them self. For if all honor were
so to be given only to god yt we should give none to no creature / where were
than goddys precepte of honor to be geuyn to our father and mother / to
pryncys / governors and rulers here in earth / And as saint Poule says every
man to other And well they wot that the church worshyppeth not sai^tys as god
but as goddis good saruauntis / and therefore the honor that is done to them
redoundeth pryncypally to ye honor of their master / like as in come^ custu^
of people we do reverence sumtyme and make great chere to sum men for their
masters sakes whom else we would not happily bid ones good morrow. And surely
if any benefit or alms done to one of crystes pore folk for his sake / be by
his high goodness reputed and accepted as done unto him self / And that who so
receyuyth one of his aposteles or dyscyples receyuyth him self / every wise
man may well consider that in like wise who so does honor his holy sayntis for
his sake does honor him self / Except these herytyques wene yt god were as
enuyouse as they be them self / And yt he would be wroth to have any honor
done to any other though it thereby redounded unto himself. whereof our
sauyoure christ well declares the contrary / for he shows him self so well
content, that his holy sayntys shall be pertyners of his honor / that he
promysyth his aposteles / that at ye dreadful dome wha^ he shall cum in his
high majesty they shall have their honorable seetis and sytte with him self
upon the iudegement of the world Christ also promised that saint mary
magdalene should be worshyped through the world and have here an honorable
remembrance for that she bestowed yt precyouse oyntement upon his holy head.
which thing when I consider it makyth me marvel of the madness of these
heretics that bark against the old ancient customs of crystys church /
mockyng the setting up of ca^dellys and with folyshe facecyes and blasphemous
mockery demand whyther god and his sayntys lak light or whyther yt be night
with them that they can not see without candle. They might as well ask what
good did that oynteme^t to christ's head. But the heretyques gruge at the cost
now / as their brother Judas did than / And say it were better spent in almys
upon pore folk And this say many of them which can neither find in their
heart to spend upon y^ one nor the the other. And sum spend sometime upon the
tone for none other intent but to the^d that they may the more boldly rebuke
and rail against the the other. But let the^ all by that ensample of ye holy
woman and by those wordys of our savior / learn yt god delyteth to se ye
fervent hete of y^ hearts deuocio^ boil out by ye body / And to do hi^ seruyse
with all such goods of fortu^e as god has geui^ man what riches devised our
lord god him self in the making and garnishyng of y^ temple and in the
ornaments of ye auter and the prestes apparayle / what was him self the
better for all this? what for ye bestes yt him self commanded to be offered him
in sacryfyce? what for ye sweet odours and frankensence? why do these
heretics more mock at ye manner of crystes church than they do at ye manner
of ye jews synagoge but if they be beter jews tha^ christian me^? If me^ will
say that the money were better spent among poor folk by who^ he more sets /
being the quycke temples of ye holy ghost made by his own hand / than by the
temples of stone made by the hand of man / This would be percase very true if
there were so little to do yt with that we should be dreuyn of necessyte to leave
ye tone vndo^e. But god geuyth enough for both / And geuyth diverse men diverse
kyndys of deuocyo^ and all to his pleasure. In which as thapostle Poule says
let every man for his part abou^de and be plentuouse in yt kind of virtue yt
the spyryte of god guydeth him to. and not to be of the folyshe mind y^ luther
is / which wishes in a sermon of his yt he had in his hand all the perys of
the holy cross / And says yt if he so had he would throw them there as never
son should shine on the^. And for what worshup full reason would ye wreche do
such velany to ye cross of christ? by cause as he says that there is so much
gold now bestowed about ye garneshyng of the pyecys of the cross that there
is none left for pore folk. Is not this a^ high reason? as though all ye
gold yt is now bestowed about the pecys of the holy cross would not have
faylede to have be^ given to pore me^ if they had not be^ bestowed abowte the
garneshi^g of the cross / And as though there were nothing lost but yt is
bestowd about cristes cross Take all ye gold yt is spent about all ye pecys of
christ's cross through christendom / albe it many a good chryste^ prince and
other godly people has honorably garnyshed many pieces thereof / yet if all yt
gold were gathered together / yt would appear a pore porcyon in comparison of
ye gold yt is bestowed upon cuppys / what speak we of cuppys? in which ye gold
albeit yt it be not given to pore men yet is it saved and may be given in
almouse when men will which they never will / how small a porcyon wene we were
ye gold about all ye pecys of chrystys cross if yt were compared with ye gold
yt is quyte cast a way about ye gilti^g of kniuis / swords / sporys / arrace /
and painted clothes: and as though these thyngis could not consume gold fast
enough y^ gylti^g of postys and hole rofes / not only in the palaces of princys
and great prelatis / but also many right mean me^nes housis. And yet among all
these thingis coud luther spy no gold yt grievously glyterid i^ his bleryd eyes
but only about ye cross of christ. yt gold if yt were the^s the wise man
wenyth yt would de straight given to pore me^. and yt where he daily sees yt
such as have their purs full of gold give to ye pore not one piece thereof but
if they give ought they ransake the botome among all ye gold to seek out here
an half penny or in his country a braspeny whereof four make a ferthing / such
goodly causes fi^d they yt ptend holiness for ye color of their cloked heresies.

The third chapter
Thobieccions of ye messe^ger made against prayeng to sayntys / worshyppyng of
ymagys / and going in pylgrymagys with the answer of the author unto the same.
And incydently is it by ye messenger moved that there should seem no necessyte
for christen folk to resort to any chyrchys / but yt all were one to pray
thens or there. And that opinion by ye author answered and confuted.

AT this point your friend desyryng me that what so ever he should say I should
not reke^ it as spoken of his own opinion / but that he would partly show me
what he had hard sum other say therein / to the end that he might the better
answer them with yt he should here of me. This protestacyo^ and prefacyon made
/ he said that albe it no good man would agree yt it were well done to do unto
sayntys or their images dyspyte or dyshonor / yet to go in pylgrymages to them
or to pray to them not only semyd in vain consyderyng y^ all they if they can
any thing do / can yet do no more for us among them all than christ can him
self alone that can do all / nor be not so ready at our hand to here us if they
here us at all as christ yt is every where / nor bear us half the love and
lo^gyng to help us that does our savior yt died for us / whom as saint Poule
says we have for our advocate before the father / But over this it semyth to
smell of Idolatry wha^ we go o^ pilgrimage to this place and that place / As
though god were not like strong or not like present in every place / But as the
deuylys were of old under ye false name of goddys present and assystent in the
Idollys and ma^metys of the paganys / so would we make it seem that god and his
saites stood i^ this place and yt place to this post and that post cut out
and caruyd in imagys. For wha^ we rekyn our self to be better herd with our
lord in kent than at Cambryge / at the north door of Poules than at the south
door / at one image of our Lady than at a another / is it not an euyde^t token
and in manner a plain proof that we put our trust and confydence in the image
self and not in god or our lady? which is as good i^ ye tone place as the
the other and the tone image no more like her than ye to^her / nor cause why she
should favor the tone before the the other. But we blind people instead of god
and his holy sayntys them self cast our affeccyons to the ymagys self and
thereto make our prayers / thereto make our offryngys / and wene these ymagys
were ye very sayntys self of whom our help and health should grow / puttyng our
full trust in this place and y^ place as negroma^cers put their trust in their
cercles with which they think them self sure against all ye deuyllys i^
hell / And wene if they were one ynch without / that than the devil would pull
them in pesys / but as for the cercle he dare not for his erys onys put over
his nose. And men reken that the clergy is glad to favor this ways and to
noryshe this superstycyon under ye name and color of deuocyo^ to ye perell of
ye peples souls for the lucre and te^porall advantage yt them self receive
of ye offrigis. when I had hard him say what him lyked I demanded if he minded
ever to be pre^^e / whereunto he answerede nay verily / for me thinks q he
that therbe preestys to many all ready but if they were better. And therefore
wha^ god shall se^de time I purpose he said to marry. well said I than sith I
am all ready married twice and therefore never can be pre^st / and ye be so set
in mind of marriage yt ye never will be priest / we two be not the most metely
to pondre what might be said in this matter for ye preestys part. ^ow be it
when I consider yt / me thynkyth surely that if the thing were sych as ye say
so far from all frame of right relygyon / and so perelous to men soull is / I
can not perceue why that the clergy would for ye gayn they get thereby / suffer
such abusyon to contynew. For first if yt were true that no pilgrimage ought to
be vsyd / non image offered unto / nor worship done / nor prayour made unto any
saint / Than if none of all these things had ever been i^ ure or now were all
undone / If that were the right way / as I wot well it were wrong / than were
it to me little question but christian people being in the true faith and in ye
right way to god w^rd / would thereby nothing slake their good mides toward the
minysters of his church / but their devotion should toward them more and more
encrese. So yt if they now get by this way one penny / theye should if this be
wrong and the the other right / not fail i^ stead of one penny now / tha^ to
receive a grote. And so should no lucre give them cause to favor this way and
it be wrong / while they coud not fail to win more by ye right. Morouer look
me through christendom and I suppose ye shall fi^d ye fruit of those offeri^ges
and right small part of the living of the clergy / And such as though su^ few
places would be glad to retain / yet the hole body might without any notable
l^sse easily forbere.

Let us consider our own cu^tre he^e / and we shall fi^d of these pilgri^^^es
(...) most part in ye hands of such relygyous persons or such pore
perryshis as bear no great rule i^ ye co^uocaco^ns^ and besides this ye shall
not fi^d I supopse yt any bishope i^ e^gla^d has ye profit of one grote of
any such offryng within his diocyse. Now stands then the continuance or the
brekynge of this manner and custom specially in them which take no profit
thereby. which if they beleuid it to be such as ye call it superstyciouse and
wykkyd / would never suffer it continue to the peryshynge of mennys souls /
whereby them self should distroye their own souls / and neither in body nor
goodys take any co^modyte. And over this we see that the bysshopp^ y^ and
prelatys them seluys visit those holy placys and pylgrimages with as large
offryngys / and as great cost in co^mi^g and goi^ge as other people do / so yt
they not only take no temporal advantage thereof / but also bestow of there
own therein.

And surely I believe this deuocyo^ so plantyd by gods own hand in the hearts
of the hole church / that is to wit not the clergy^ only but the hole
congregacyon of all crystyn people / that if the spyrytualtye were of the mind
to leave it / yet would not the temporaltye suffer it.

Now if it so were that pilgrymages hanged only upon ye couytyse of evil
prestes / for evil must they be that would for couytyse help the people
forward to idolatrye / than would not good prestys and good bysshoppys have used
the^ their selves. But I am very su^e that many an holy bishop / and therewith
excell^ntely well lernyd in scripture / and the law of god have had high
devotion thereto.

For where as ye say (...) that yt smells of Idolatrye to vysyt this place
and that place / as though god were more mighty or more present in oone place
then a another / or that god or his sayntys hade bounden them selves to stand at
this Image or that Image / and that by me^nes demeanure thereby should appear
that the pylgrymys put their trust in ye place or the Image yt self taking
that for very god / or for the very saint of whom they seek for help / and so
fare like necromancers that put their trust i^ ye cercle / Surely sir holy
saint Austen man epystyll of his which he wrote to the clergy and the people
takethe pylgrimagys for a more erenest thing. And says that though the cause
be to us unknown why god does in some place miracles and in sum place none /
yet is it no doubt but he so does. And therein hade that good holy doctor so
great confydence that as he ^ayeth him self / he sent two of his prestys in
pilgrimage for the trial of the troth of a great matter in contencyon and
debate between them out of Hyppona in affryke unto saint Stephens church in
myllayn / where many miracles werre wont to be showed / to thend that god might
there by sum means / cause the truth to be declared and made open by his power
/ which by no mean known to man he could well find out /

Nor they yt goone on pilgrimage do nothing like to those necromancers to whom
ye resemble them that put their confydence in the rundell and cercle on ye
ground / for a special beloue that they have in the c^^pa^e of that ground by
reason of folyshe (...) and fygure^ about it with inuocacyons of evil
spyrytys and famylyaryt^ with deuy^^i^ being enmys to god / and the craft and
ways of all that warke by god him self prohibyted and forbode^ and that upon
the pain of death / what lyknes has y^ unto the going of good men unto holy
placys not by enchau^tme^te dedicat to ye devil / but by gods holy ordinance
with his holy words consecratyd unto him self. which two thingys if ye would
resemble to gyther so might ye blaspheme and have i^ dyrision all the devout
rytes and cerymonys of the church / both in the divine service as encensyng /
haloyng of the fire / of ye funt / of the pascall lamb / and over y^ the
exorcysmys / benedyccyons / and holy strange gesturys vsid in consecracyon or
mynystracyon of the blesyd sacrame^tys / all which holy thyngys great part
whereof was from hand to hand left in the church from the time of cristys
apostles and by them left unto us as yt was by god taught unto them / men might
now folyly myslyken unto ye superstycyous demeanure and fond fassyon of
iuglery. Nor the flok of christ is not so folyshe as those heretyques bear them
i^ hand / that where as there is no dog so mad but he knows a very cony from
a cony carved and painted / christian people that have reason in their heddes and
thereto the light of faith in their soulys should wene that thimagys of our lady
were our lady her self. Nay they be not I trust so mad but they do reverence
to thymage for ye honor of the person whom yt representyth / as eury man
delytyth i^ thymage and remembrau^s of his friend. And al^e yt that every good
christian man has a remembryng of crystys passion in his mi^d and co^^^yuith by
devout meditacio^ a form and fassyo^ thereof in his heart / yet is the^e no man
I (...) so good nor so well ler^ed nor i^ meditacyo^ so well accustomyd /but
that he fyndyth him self more mouid to pite and compassion upon the
beholdynge of the holy crucifyxe than when he lakkith it / And if there be any
that for the mai^tenau^ce of his opinion will perauenture say that he fyndeth
it otherwise in him self / he should give me cause to fere that he has of
crystys passion neither the tone way nor the the other but a very fai^t feeling /
sith that the holy fathers before us did / and all devout people about us do
find and feel in the^ self the contrary

Now for the reason that you alege quod I / where ye say that in resorting to
this place and that place / this image and that image / we seem to reken as
though god were not i^ every place like mighty or not like present / this
reason proceeds no more against pilgrymagys tha^ against all the chyrchys i^
christian do^e. For god is as mighty i^ the stable as in ye temple. And as he is
not co^phe^sible nor circu^scrybed no where / so is he present every where /
But this lets not heaven / be it a corporal thing or not / to be the place
of a special manner and kind of his presence / in which hit lykyth him to
show his glorious majesty to his blessed heavenly company which he shows not
unto dampened wretches in hell / and yet is he never thense. So li^id it his
goodness to go with his chosen people thorough the deserte i^ the cloud by day
and the pyler of fire by night / yet was he not bounden as ye resemble it like
the damned spyrytys to the old Idolys of the panyms /

It likid him also to chese the arche yt was carried with his people / at which
arche specially by miracle he diverse times declared his especyall assystence
the arche being traunslatyd fro place to place. was it not also his pleasure to
be specially present in his temple of Jerusalem till he suffered it to be
distroyed for their sin. And instead of that oone place of prayer to which
he would before that all his people should come he has vouchsaffyd to sprede him
self abroad in to many temples / and i^ more acceptable wise to be worshypped
in many templys through out his cristyn flokke /

Here said your fr^nd that the temple of christ is as saint poule says
ma^nis heart / and that god is not included nor shytte in any place / And so
hi^ self said to the woman of Samarie / that very worshyppers should worship
in spyryte / and in truth / not i^ the hill or in hyerusal^m or any other
temple of stone /

whereunto I showed hi^ that I would well agree / that no t^mple of stone was unto
god so plesaunt as the temple of mannys heart / But yet that nothing lets or
wythstandyth but that god will that his cryste^ people have i^ sundry placys
sundry temples and chyrchis to which they should beside their pryuat prayours
assemble solemply / and resort in company to worship him to gether such as
dwell so nere to gether that they may conveniently resort to one place.

For albe it our savior said quod I unto the woman of whom ye spoke that the
time should come i^ which they should neither worship god i^ that hill of
Gezara not in hyerusalem neither / which places were after dystroied and
desolate / and the Pagane manner of worshyppi^g of ye tone / and ye Iues manner
of worshippi^g in ye the other turnyd both in to the manner of worshypi^g of
criste^ Faith and religyon / yet said he not to her yt they should never after
worship god i^ none other temple / But he said that the time should come / and
tha^ was comen all ready when the very true worshyppers should worship god in
spyryt and truth / And that as god is a spyrytuall substance / so lokyd he for
worshypers that should i^ such wise worship him. In which wordys our savior
reprouyd all false worship as was vsyd after paganysme i^ that hill in Samaria
/ and all such worship as was done i^ any place with opynio^ that god might
not be worshyppyd else where. Those yt so believe they be such as bind god to a
place / which our Lord reprouyth / showing that god may in heart truly and
spyrytually be worshipid every where. But this excludyth not that besidis that
he will be worshyppyd in his holy temple / no more tha^ when he gave counsel
that for auoydyng of vaynglorye a man shall not stand and pray in the street
to gather worldely praise / but rather secretly pray in his chamber / This
counsel forbadde not the Jews to whom he gave it that they should never after
cum in to the temple / and pray.

And suerly albeit that su^ good man here and there one among.x. thousand as
saint Poule and saint Antony / and a few such other like / do live all heavenly
far out of all fleshly cumpany / as far from all occasyo^ of worldly wrechednes
/ as from the comen temple or parysh church / yet if chyrches and co^gregacyo^s
of crystyn people resorti^g to gether to gods service were onis aboleshed and
put away / we were like to have few good temples of god i^ me^nys souls / but
all would within a while wear away clean and clearly fall to naught. And this
preue we by exper^ence / that those which be the best temples of god in their
souls / they most use to cum to the temple of stone / And those that lest cum
there be well known for very rebaudys and vnthryftys / and openly perseyuyd
for temples of the devil / And this not in our days only / but so has been
from Crystys days hither / I trow no man doutyth but that Crystys appostyls
were holy temples of god in their souls / And well understood ye wordis of
their master spokyn to the woman of Samary / as the thing which their master
after told them him self / or else how cold sum of them have wrytyn that
co^munycacyon which none of them hard as apperyth by the gospel. But they not
in their masters days only / but also after his resurrexyo^ and after that
they had reseyuyd the holy ghost / and were by hi^ instructyd of every truth
longyng to ye necessyte of their saluacyo^ / were not content only to pray
secretly by them self in theyer chambers / but also resortyd to ye temple to
make their prayers / And i^ y^ place as a place plesa^t to god did they pray
in spyryte and in truth / As well apperyth in the book of saint Luke wryttyn of
the Actys of Crystes holy Apostellys / So that no doubt is there / but that yet
unto this day and so forth to the worldys end / it is and shall be plesau^te
unto god / that his chosen people pray to him and call upon him in temple and
church. whereof hi^ self wytnessyth with the Prophet / Domus mea domus
orationis vocabitur. My house shall be called a^ house of prayer. Now makith your
reason as I said no more against pylgrymages than against every chirch. For as
god is not bounden to the place / nor our confydence bounden to the place but
unto god though we reke^ our prayour more plesaunt to god in the church tha^
without / by cause his high goodness accepts it so / in like wise do not we
reken our lord bounden to ye place or image where ye pilgrimage is though we
worship god there because him self lykyth so to have it.

The.iiii. chapter.
The author declares in ye co^probacyon of pylgrymagys that yt is the pleasure
of god to be specially sought and worshypped in some one place before a
another. And albe that we can not attain to ye knowledge of the cause why god
does so / yet ye author proves by greatte authoryte that god by miracle
testyfyeth yt is so.

with this your fre^d asked me what reason were there y^ god would set more by
one place than by a another / or how know we yt he so does namely if the t^ne be
a church as well as the the other. whereunto I answered that why god would do yt I
could make him no answer no more tha^ saint austen says that he coud. I
was never so nere of his counsel nor dare not be so bold to ask him / but that
he so does in deed yt I a^ sure Inoughe. yet not for that he settyth more by
that place for the soil and pauement of ye place / but that his pleasure in
some place is to show more his assystence and to be more specially sought unto
than in sum other. Tha^ he as^ed me whereby was I so sure of yt. wheruppon I
demanded him that if it so were yt the thing sta^dyng in debate and questyo^ /
it would like our lord to show a miracle for the proffe of the tone part /
would ye not quod I reken than the questyon were decyded / and ye dowte
assoyled / and yt part suffycyently proued^ yes mary quod he that would I. well
quod I than is this matter out of doubt long a go. for god has proved my
part in diverse pylgrymages by the workyng of many moo tha^ a thousand
miracles one time and other. In the gospel of John the fyft chapter where we
read that the angel moved the water / and who so next went in was cured of his
disease / was it not a suffycyent proof that god would they should cum thither
for their health / Albe yt no man can tell why he sentt tha^gell rather thither
and there did his miracles than in a another water? But when so ever our lord
has in any place wrought a miracle / all though he nothing do it for ye place
/ but for ye honor of ye saint whom he will have honored in yt place / or for
ye fayeth yt he fyndeth with some that prays in that place / or for
thencrease of fayeth which he fyndeth falling and decayed in that place nedyng
the show of so^ miracles for the reuyuyng / what so ever ye cause be / yet I
think thaffeccyon is to be commended of men and women yt with good deu^cyon
ro^ne thither where they see or here that our lord shows a demo^stracyon of
his special assyste^ce. And when he shows many in ^one place / it is a good
toke^ yt he would be sought upon and worshypped there. Many jews were there
that ca^ to hyerusalem to se ye miracle that christ had wroght upon lazare as
the gospel reherseth. and suerly we were worse than jews if we would be so
neclygent that where god works miracles / we list not ^ons go move our foot
thetherwarde. we marueyle much that god shewethe ^omoo miracles now a days /
when yt is much more marvel that he does vouchsaufe to show any at all among
such unkind slothful dedely people as list not oones lift up their heddes
to look thereon / or yt our incredulyte ca^ suffer him now adays to work any.

The.v. chapter.
Because pylgrimages be among other prouys testyfyed by miracles / ye messe^ger
does make obieccyo^ against those miracles / partly lest they be faynyd and
untrue / partly lest they be done by ye devil if they be do^e at all

THa^ said your fre^d / well I perseue the^ y^ force and effect of all ye proof
sta^dyth all in miracles / which I will agree to be a strong proof if I saw
the^ do^ and were sure y^ god or good saints did them / But first sith ye me^
may and happily do of miracles make many a lie / we must not prove this matter
by the miracles / but if we furste prove yt the miracles were true. And over
this if they were done in ded / yet since ye a^gell of darkness may tra^sforme
and tra^sfigure him self / in to an a^gell of light / how shall we know
whether ye miracle were don by god to the^crease of cryste^ deuocyo^ / or do^
by ye craft of ye devil to thaduau^ceme^t of mysbyleue and idolatrye / in
setting me^nys hartys upon stokkys and stones instead of sayntys / or upon
sayntys them self that are but creatures instead of god him self.

I answered him that the force off my tale was not the miracles / but ye thing
yt I hold stronger the^ any miracles / which as I said in ye begynyng I reke^
so sure and fast and therwt so plain and euyde^t unto every cryste^ man / yt
it needs no other proof / and ye thing is as I laid before ye faith of
christ's church by ye come^ consent whereof these matters be decyded and well
known yt ye worship of sayntys and imagys been allowed approbate and
accustumed for good christen and merytoryous virtues. and ye contrary opinion
not only reproved by many holy doctors / but also co^de^pned for heresies by
sundry general cou^sayls. And this in ye begynyng I told you q I was and should
be ye force and stre^gh of my tale / Albe yt of truth I said unto you beside
/ yt me thought yt ye miracles wrought by god were suffycye^t proof and
auctoryte therefore all though there were none other. which thing sith ye seem
to inpugne / I shall as I ca^ make you answer thereunto. Nay sir says he I pray
you take me not so as though yt I did impugn it but as I showed ye before / I
rehersyd you what I have hard some other say. In good time q I. Tha^ because
they be not here I prey you defend and bear out their perte with all yt ye have
hard the^ say / And set thereto also all yt ever your own mind gives you yt
they may more heraftyr say lest you retorn not fully furnishid for your
purpose.

The.vi chapter
Because ye messenger thynkyth yt he may well mystrust and deny the miracles /
because reason and nature tell him that they can not be do^ / therefore first
y^ author shows what vnresonablenes would ensue / if folk would stand so
styffe against all credence to be given to any such thing as reason and nature
should seem to gain say.

ANd first where ye say. Nay quod he where they say. well quod I so be it
where they say / For here ever my tongue tryppythe. But now therefore first
where they say yt they never saw any of these miracles them self / and
therefore the miracles be no proof to them which while they never saw them are
not bounde^ to be leave them / they seem either very necligent if they nothing
^^uere wha^ they mystrust and dout of the troth in such a wayghty matter / or
if they have dylyge^tly made enserche than must it needs be yt they have hard
of so many told and rehersyd by the mou^hes and the writing of so good and
credyble personis / that the ye seem unreasonably suspycyous if they think
all to gether lies that so many tre^ me^ or me^ like to be true so faithfully
do report. If these me^ were ^uggys few matters would take e^de at their hand /
or at ye le^t y^ playntife should have well speed if they would bileue no thing
but that were proved / nor reke^ nothing proved but yt they se them self. Thus
may every man reke^ him self unsure of his own father if he believe no man /
or because all ye proof thereof sta^dyth but upon one woman / And yt upon her
which though she can tell best / yet if yt be wrong has gr^test cause to ly.
Let ye knowledge of y^ father alone there fore among our wy^^y^ mysteries / And
let us se if we believe nothing but y^ we se our self. who ca^ reke^ him self
sure of his own mother / for pos^^ble it were y^ he were changed in ye cradell
/ and a ^yche ma^nis (...) bring ho^^ her own child for her masters / and
keep her masters for her own to make her o^^ a ge^tylma^ good ^h^pe. And this
were no great mastery / while ye mother has of her own child no ^re mark.
Sir q your friend if I should (...) and by these examples prove the^ yt they were
of reason bou^de^ to believe (...) ^^^^^les as were reportyd because many
^^^dyble me^ tell the^ / for as mo^^ as ^^ys we should bileue nothing but that
(...) ^e our self / and than were all the ^^rld full of co^^u^yon / nor no
judgment could be geu^/but upon thyngys (...) judges ^ight / I should I fere me
very ^ebly saty^^y them. For they would (...) say yt t^e^ samples be nothing
like y^ matter. But as it is reason yt I should believe honest me^ in all such
things as may be true / and wherei^ I se no cause why they should lie / so were
agayn^^ all reason to bileue me^ be they never so many / seem they never so
credible / where as reason and nature (of which tw^yne every one is alone more
credyble then they all) shows me plainly yt their tal^ is untrue / as yt
must nedy^ if the matter be unpossyble as it is in all ^hes myr^cles. And in
such case though I can ^seue no profit yt they ca^ receive thereby / yet wh^ I
well se yt it coud not be true I must well se that it (...) not tre^^. And
thereby must I nedi^ ^^owe yt y^ they can take no profyt by lying / they ly not
for any coueryer / but eue^ only for their special pleasure. Forsooth q I this
is right meryly a^swered. and to say the trothe / as far as we be yet gone in
the matter of these miracles not my (...) amysse / nor very far fro ye point.
But sith this thing is much materyal^ as wheruppo^ many great thy^^ys do depend
/ we shall no^ so shortly sha^e y^ of / but we shall cum one ^^ep or (...)
nere to y^ matter. And fyr^^ I wy^^ say to the^ that it were hard for them and
n^^ very sure to believe yt every ^a^ lies / why^h tellyth the^ a tale for true
ye re^^ and nature semyth to she^ the^ to be falls and i^possible. For i^ this
w^^e shall they in many thi^gys err and clearly deceive th^^ self. And ^^tyme
(...) they make th^^ self sure (...) y^ wrong side if they wol^ (...) (...)
done believe no man that tell yt them / able yt yt yt be no perell to their
soul / yet so much have they knowledge ye les / and vnresonably stand in their
^^^our ^horow the mystrustyng of the truth. It is not yet fyfty years a goo
syns y^ furst man as far as me^ have hard / ca^e to london that ever parted y^
gylt from the silver consumyng shorte^y the silver into dust with a very fayer
water / In so far forth that when the fyners and goldsmythes of london hard
fy^st thereof they nothing wondered thereof but laughed thereat as at an
impossyble ly / i^ which persuasions if they had co^tynued still ^hey had yet
at this day la^^ed all that connyng. yet will I not say nay but that a man may
be to light in believe / and be by such ensamples brought into believe to far.
As ^ good fe^ow and friend of mine late i^ talkyng of this matter of marueylys
and miracles entending merely to make me believe for a troth a thing yt could
never be / first brought in what a force the fire has that will make two pieces
of iron able to be joined and cleue to gyther / and with the help of ye h^me^
^e made both one which no h^meryng could do without the fire / which thing
because I daily see I assented. Than said he ferther / yt yet was more
maruayle that the fire shall make ^^en to ^o^ne as silver or lead does / and
make it take a prynt. which thing I told him I had never seen / but byc^use he
said he had seen it I thought it to be true. Sone after this / he would have me
to believe yt he had seen a piece of silver of two or three inchys about and in
length leesse than afote drawn by man's hand through strayte holes made in a
irone till it was brought in thyknesse not half a inche about / and i^ length
drawn out I cannot tell how many yardys. And when I hard hi^ say yt he saw
this hi^ self tha^ I wist well he was merely dysposed. Mary sir q your friend
it was hye time to give him over wha^ he ca^ to y^. well said I what if I should
tell you now yt I had seen ye same / by my faith q he merely I would believe it
at leysour when I had seen the same / and in ye mean while I could not let you
to say your pleasure i^ your own house but I would thynk that ye were dysposed
merely to make me a fool. well said I / what if there would besydys me / ten
or.xx. good honest men tell you ye same tale / and that they had all seen the
thing done them self. In faith quod he sith I am sent hither to believe you / I
would in that point believe your self alone / as well as them all. well quod I ye
mean ye would believe us all a like. But what would you than say if one or twain
of them would say more. Mary q he than would I believe them less. what if they
would q I show you yt they have seen that the piece of silver was over gylt. and
the same piece being still drawn through the holes ye gylt not rubbyd of but
still goo forth i^ lenght with the silver so that all ye lenght of many yerdes
was gylted of the gyltynge of the first piece not a foot long? Surely sir quod
he those twain yt would tell me so much more I would say were not so cu^nyng
in the mayntena^ce of a lie as was the pylgrymys companyon whyth when his
fellow had told at york yt he had seen of late at london / a bird that
keuered all poules church yard with his wyngys: coming to the same place on
the morrow said that he saw not that bird: but he hard much speech thereof /
but he saw in Powles church yard an egg so great that.x. men could scant
move yt with leuers / this fellow could help it forth with a proper side way /
But he were no good under propper of a lie that would mynyshe his credence with
afyrmyng all the fy^st and setting a louder lie thereto. well said I tha^ I have
espied if.x. should tell you so ye would not believe the^. No quod he not if.xx.
should. what if an hundred would quod I that seemed good and credable. if they
were q he ten thousand they were not of crede^ce with me when they should tell
me that they saw ye thing that my self knows by nature and reason impossible
For when I know it could not be done / I know well that they lie all / be
they never so many that say they saw it done. well quod I sith I se well ye
would not in this point believe a hole town / ye have put me to silence / that I
dare not now be bol^e to tell you that I have seen yt my self. But surely if
wytnes would have seruede me I wene I might have brought you a great meny good
men that would say and swear to that they have seen it the^ self. But now
shall I provide me to morrow peradventure a cople of wytnes of whom I wot well
ye will myst^uste neither another. who be they quod he for yt were hard to find
who^ I could better trust the^ your self / who^ what so ever I have merely
said I cold not in good faith but believe you in that ye should tell me ernestly
upon your own knowledge. But ye use my master says to look so sadly / wha^
ye mean merely / that many times men dowte whether ye speak in sport wha^ ye
mean good erneste. In good faith quod I / I mean good ernest now / and yet as
well as ye dare trust me I shall as I said if ye will go with me provide a
couple of witness of whom ye will believe any one better tha^ twain of me /
for they be your nerre frendys / and ye have been better acquaynted with them /
and such as I dare say for them be not often wont to lie. who be they q he I
pray you. Mary quod I your own two eyn / for I shall if you will bring you
where ye shall se it / no ferther hens than even here in london. And as for
iron and laten to be so drawn in length ye shall se it do^e in.xx shoppes
almost in one street. Mary sir quod he these wytnes in deed will not lie / As
the poor man said by the priest if I may be so ho^ly to tell you a merry tale
by the way. A merry tale quod I cummyth never a mys to me. The pore man quod he
had found the priest over famylyer with his wyffe / and because he spoke hy^ a
broad and could not prove it the pressed sued him before the bysshoppys
offycyall for dy^famacyo^ / where the poor man upon pain of cursyng was
commanded that in his paryshe church he should upon the sunday at high mass
time / stand up and say mou^h thou lie. whereupon for fulfyllyng of his
penance up was the pore soul set in a pew that ye people might wonder on
him and here what he said / And there all a loud when he had rehersyd what he
had reportyd by ye pressed / than he set his handys on his mouth / and said
mouth mouth thou lie. And by and by theruppon he set his hand upon both his
eyes and said / but eyes eyes quod he by the mass ye lie not a whytte And so
sir in deed / and ye bring me those wyttnes they will not lie a whyt How be it
sir and though this be true / as in good faith I believe and am sure that it is
/ yet am I never the more bounden by reason to believe the^ y^ would tell me a
miracle. For though this thing be incredyble to him that hereth it / and
strange and meruelus to him that sees yt / yet is it a thing that may be
done / But he that tells me a miracle / tells me a thing that can not be
don. I showed you quod I this ensample to put you in mind that in being over
hard of believe of things tha^ by reason and nature seem and apere i^possyble /
where they be repottyd by credyble witness having no cause to lie / there is as
much peril of error as where men be to light of crede^ce / And thus much have
I proved you o^warde that if ye believe no man in such things as may not be /
than must it follow that ye ought to believe no man in many thyngys that may be /
for all is oone to you / whyther they may be or may not be / if it seem to you
that they may not be. And of truth ye cannot tell whether they may be or may
not be / except they be two such thyngys as imply co^tradiccion / as oone self
thing in oone self part to be both white and blakke. For else many thyngys
shall seem to you such as all reason will resyste / and nature will in no wise
admytte / And yet they shall be done well inoughe / And be in some other place
in comen use and custom. But now because / all your shyfte stands i^ this
that of a miracle told you ye may with reason believe that all men lie because
reason and nature being more to be believed than all they / tells you that
they say wrong in that the thing reportyd for a miracle can not be done / I
have showed you that nature / and reason does show you yt many thyngys may not
be don which yet in deed be done so ferforth y^ when ye se them done ye may
right well account the^ as miracles for any thing that reason or nature can
show you by what natural order and cause yt could be done / but that ye shall
still se reason stand quyte against yt as in the drawing of the silver or iron.

The.vii. chapter.
The Author shows that nether nature nor reason do deny the miracles to be
true / nor do not gayn say but yt they may be well and easly done.

SIr says he yet hytte we not the point / for albe it yt many things be well
done / and by nature / which neither my wit nor happily no mannys else can
attayn so nere to natures counsel that we can theri^ perceive her craft / But
like as su^ rude people / muse upon a clokke / yt has ye spryng which is the
cause of his mouyng secretly conveyed and closed in the barrel / so marueyle
we and wonder on her work / yet allway all those thyngys dyffer and be unlike
to miracles. In that your self will agree with me yt when I believe yt reason and
nature techeth me surely that miracles be thyngys that can not be done / I am
not i^ this deceyuyd though I may be i^ such other things deceived as seem
impossyble and yet may be done. And therefore as concerning miracles i^ which
your self will agree that I am not by any mystakyng of reason and nature
deceived / ye may not your self me thinks say nay / but yt I may well with
reason believe them twain against all them that will tell me they have seen
such thyngys don as your self does agree / that they twain that is to wit
nature and reason does verily and trewly show me can not be don. what manner of
thingys be those q I. Mary miracles quod he such as your self will agree to be
don against nature. Give us thereof quod I sum e^sample. As if me^ quod he would
now cum tell me yt at our lady of rouncyuale / there were a deed child
restored again to lyffe / let that quod I be oone / and let a another be yt a
bishop in the byldyng of his church fyndyng one beam cut a great dele to
short for his work / drew it forth between a another man and him four foot
(and ye will) longer than it was and so made it serve / Be yt by my troth q
he. will we quod I take for the third / yt a man was by miracle in a pater
noster while / co^ueyd a mile of from oone place to a another. be hit so quod
he. Now they that should tell me quod he that they had seen these three
miracles were I bound to believe the^? whether ye were bou^de^ quod I or no / we
shall see ferther after / But now why should ye not of reason trust them if the
men be credyble / and ernestly report yt / and peradventure on there oaths
depose it / having no cause to feign it nor lykely to lie and be forswornen for
naught. I will quod he not believe them because that nature and reasone are two
recordys more to be byleued tha^ all they that bear witness against them. why
quod I what does reason and nature tell you. They twain tell me quod he yt
those.iii. thyngys ca^ not be done / which those men sey they saw done. wot
you quod I that reason and nature tell you so. ye mary quod he yt I wot well
they do / and I think your self will agree that they tell me so. Nay by saint
Mary sit quod I that will I not^ for I think that neither reason nor nature
tells you so / but rather both two tell you clean the contrary / that is to
wit that they both bear witness that those three thyngys and such other like
be thingys that may be well and easly done / ye quod he: mary this is a another
way. The^ have we walked wrong a while if ye prove that. Me thinks quod I no
thing more easy to prove than that / For I pray you tell me quod I do reason
and nature show you that there is a god or not? Faith shows me yt surely
quod he / but whyther nature and reso^ shew^^ me or no that I doubt / sith
great reasoned men and philosophers have dowted thereof And some of them plainly
persuaded and in believe that there was none at all / and the hole people of the
world in effect fallen from knowledge or believe of god in to Idolatry and
worshype of mammottys. Nay quod I there is little dowte I trowe^but that nature
and reason gives us good knowledge that there is a god. for albe it the
gentylys worshypped among them a thousand false goddis / yet all that proves
yt there was and is in all men's heddys a secret consent of nature that god
there is or else they would have worshypped no^e at all. Now as for ye
philosophers though a very few dowted / and one or twain thought there was
none / yet as oone swalow makes not somer so ye folly of so few makes no
change of the matter against all the hole noumber of the old philosophers.
which as saint Poule confessyth found out by nature and reason that there was a
god either maker or governor or both of all this hole e^gyne of the world. The
maruelouse bewtye and constant course whereof / shows well that it neither
was made nor governed by chance. But when they had by these vysyble thyngys
knowledge of his inuysyble majesty / tha^ did they / as we do / fell from the
worship of him to ye worship of Idols as now do christen me^ / not as
herytyques lay to ye charge of good people in doing reverence to sayntys (...)
/he wrought it not to the vttermo^^s of his power / but with sych degrees of
goodness as his hye pleasure lyked to lymyt. For else were his work of as infynyte
perfeccy^n as him self. And of such infynyte eg^ll per^eccyo^ was there by god
brought forth nothing but only ye two persons of the trynyte / yt is to wit ye
son and the holy ghost. of which two the son was furste by the father
begotten / and after the holy ghost by the father and the son / after I say
i^ order of beginning but not in time producyd and brought forth. And in this
hye generacyon and produccyon did the doers work both wyllyngly and naturally
/ and after the vtterest parfeccyon of them self / which they did only therein ^
in none other thing. And therefore god might break up the hole world if he
would and make a beter by and by. and not only change in the n^turall course
of this world sum things to the beter. How be it god in workyng of miracles
does nothing against nature / but some special benefyte above nature. And he
does not against you that does a another a good torn which ye be not able to
do. And therefore sith god may do what he will being almighty / and in doing of
miracles he does for the beter / neither reason nor nature shewyth you that
they which say they saw such miracles / do tell you a thing yt can not be done
/ sith ye have no reason to prove that god either can not do yt or will not do
yt. For sith he ca^ do it and yt may be that he will do yt / why should we
mystruste good and honest men that say they saw him do yt.

The.ix. chapyter.
The author shewyth (...) albe yt men may mystruste some of the p^^tyculer
myracle^/yet c^^ there no reasonable (...) neither deny nor (...)/but that ^any
miracles has there been done and wrought.

FOrsothe quod he and yet (...) for miracles I were notte for all this bou^de^
to believe any. for I spoke n^uer yet with any man yt cou^e tell me that ever he
saw any It may q I fortune you to live so long that yt shall find no man that
was by at your crystenyng / nor when ye were bishopped neither. Mary q he for
ought^ I wot I have lived so long all ready. why dout we not than q I whyther
ye were ever crystenyd or not? For every man quod he presumyth and believes
that I a^ crystenyd / as a thing so comenly done / that we reken our self sure
yt no man leuyth yt ^ndone. I^ the comen presumpsyon quod I suffycyently serve
you to set your mind in surete / than albeit miracles be nothing comenly and
customably done / nor that no presumpcyon can suffy^^ently serve for ye proof
of this miracle or that / yet has there ever from the beginning of the world
in every nacyon christian ^ he then / and almost every town at so^ dry times so
many miracles and m^^uayls been wrought beside the come^ cour^ of nature / that
I thynk through ye world yt is as well believed universally that miracles and
maruayl^ the^ be / as any thing is believed that men look upon. So that if
comen presu^psio^ serve you / ye may as I said as w^l believe that miracles be
done / (...) that your self was ever cry^^enyd. For I dare well say that
the^e ^r a thousand yt bele^e there has been miracles do^e / against one that
beleuyth that ye were ever cry^^enyd / or ever wist whether ye were borne or
not. Nor ye doctors of Cry^^ys church did n^u^r mystrus^ ye wonders and
m^r^^yl^ t^^t the ^^^nymes tell and write too have been done by their false
goddis / but assygneth them to have been done by the devil through gods
sufferau^ce for thyllusyon of them that with idolatry had deserved to be
deluded. And whyther they be miracles by which name we commonly call the
wonders wrought by god or merueyles done by the deuel it forseth not for this
purpose of ours. For if ye grant that the deu^ll may do any by goddis
suffera^ce / ye can not say nay but god may much more ^asily do him self. And
since ye be a christen man and receive scripture I might i^ this matter quod I
have choked you long a go / with the manyfold miracles and meruailes yt be
showed there.

The.x. chapter.
Thauthor prouyth yt many things daily don by nature or craft whereof we
nothing merueyle at all / be more marvelous and more wonderful in deed than
be the miracles yt we most marueyle of and repute most incredyble.

NAy quod he suerly though it has done me good to here what ye would say / yet
I nether dout nor I suppose no good man else / but that god has beside the
comen course of nature wrought many miracles. But yet of those that men tell of
/ as done in our time / by which ye would it should seem that it were well prouyd
that the prayng to sayntys / going on pylgrymagys / and worshyppyng of ymagys
were well and suffycyently prouyd / all though there were none other proof
theruppo^ / of these miracles did I mean / in the report of which me thynkyth I
need not believe a comen fame of ^hys miracle and that begone by such sily woman
seki^g saint Sithe when ^he syghyth for myscastyng other ^ays. Of these
miracles I speak / and all such as men say now adays be done at diverse
pylgrymages by diverse saints or diverse ymagys / in which the thynkyth yt such
as be told to be don which nature and reason says be impossyble / I may well
mystrust ye tellers. Or else how many of the^ shall make me a suffycyent proof
of an impossyble matter? One or two or three either semyth me to few to trust
their credence in a thing so incredible. And if I shall not believe them till I
find many recordys / I wene I were feign to wander ye world about or I prouyd
many miracles suffyciently / of such I say as ye prove your pylgrymages by.
your few wordys q I have wrappyd in them many thingys that seem somewhat as
they be couchyd to geder. which when we se them vnfoldyd and consider each part
a sonder / than may we better examyn them and better se whereof they serve.
Furste ye speak of seki^g to sayntys for sleyght causys. as for ye loss or
mysse of kyttis ka^s. Than ye would wit how many ye must here say they saw a
miracle or ye should of reason believe yt. Thyrdly ye thynk ye were like to go
long or ye should find any prouyd true. Finally when ye say that ye mean only
those miracles that men tell of / as done at pylgr^magys / ye seem to put
still a differe^s between those miracles wroght in pylgrymag^ and such as are
wrought by god otherwise / The cause whereof I must ferther ask you after. For
I perceive not well what ye mean by yt / But first where as ye speak still as
though ye might mistrust the^ were they never so many: because they tell you a
thing that reason and nature says is impossyble / me thinks yt ye should now
change that word. For I have all ready / prouyd that reason and nature say not
that a miracle is i^possible / but only that it is impossyble to nature. And
they confess both that miracles be possible to god and they that report them
do report them for such. And therefore they do report you none i^possible tale.
For the clerer co^syderacion whereof / let us resort to ye miracles which we
were agreed should stand for examples / And first if men should tell you yt they
saw before an image / of the crucifix a deed man raysid to life / ye would much
merua^le thereof / and so might ye well. yet could I tell you sum what that I
have seen my self that me thinks as great a marvel / but I have no list to
tell you because that ye be so circumspect and ware in believe of any miracles /
yt ye would not believe yt for me but mystrust me for it. Nay sir quod he i^ good
faith / if a thing seemed me never so far vnlykly / yet if ye would ernystly
say yt your self have seen yt / I neither would nor could mystrust yt, well
quod I tha^ ye make me the bolder to tell you. And yet will I tell you nothing /
but that I would if need were find you good witness to prove it. It shall not
need sir q he / but I beseech you let me here it. For soth quod I because we
speak of a man raysyd from death to life. There was i^ the parish of saint
steuenes i^ walbrok in london where I dwellid before I came to chelsyth / a man
and a woman which at yet quyk and quethynge and young were they both. The
eldyst I am sure passyd not.xxiiii. It happed them as does among young folk /
ye tone to cast a mind to the the other. And after many lettis / for y^ mayde^s
mother was mich against yt / at last they came to gether and were married in
saint Stephens chirch which is not greatly famous for any miracles / but yet
yearly on saint steuyn day it is so^what sought unto / and vysyted with folkis
deuocio^. But now short tale to make / this young woman as the manner is in
brydis ye wot well was at night brought to bed with honest women. And than
after that went the bryde grome to bed. And every body went their ways and
left them twayn there alone. And that same night / yet abide let me not lie.
now i^ faith to say the troth I am not very sure of the time / but suerly as
it aperid afterward yt was of lyklyhod y^ same night or su^ other time sone
after except yt happened a little before. No force for the time quod he. Troth
quod I / and as for the matter all the paryshe will testefye for truth the
woman was known for so honest. But for the conclusion the seed of them twayn /
turned in the woman's body / first into blood / and after into shape of man
child. And than waxed quyk and she great therwyth. And was within y^ year
delivered of a fair boy / and forsooth yt was not than (for I saw yt myself)
passing the lenght of a foot. And I am sure he is grown now an ynch longer
than I. How long is yt agoo quod he. By my faith q I / about xxi. years. Tush
quod he this is a worthy miracle. In good faith quod I never wist I that any
man could tell that he had any other beginning. And me thynkyth that this is as
great a miracle as the reysyng of a deed man. If yt seem so q he to you / than
have you a maruelouse semynge / for I wene yt semyth so to no man else. No quod
I ca^ ye tell what is ye cause? None other surely but that the acquayntau^ce
and daily beholding takyth a way the wo^deryng / as we nothing wonder at the
ebbyng and flowyng of the sea / or the thamys because we daily se it. But he
that had never seen it nor hard thereof would at the first sight wonder sore
the^at to se that great water cum walowyng up against the wind keeping a common
course to and fro / no cause perseyued yt dryueth him. If a man borne blind
had suddenly his sight what wou^der would he make to see the son the moon / and
the stars / where as one yt has seen them syxtene year to gether marueylyth
not so much of the^ all / as he would wonder at the first sight of a pecokkys
tail. And verily cause can I se none / why we should of reason mo^e maruayle
of ye reuyuyng of a deed man than of the bredyng / bryngyng forth and growyng
of a chyl^e unto ye state of a man. No more meruelouse is a koko tha^ a cokk /
though ye tone be seen but in somer and the ^other all ye year. And I am sure
if ye saw deed me^ as commonly called a gain by miracle / as ye se men
brought forth by nature / ye would reke^ yt less maruayle to bring the soul
again into the body / kepi^g yet still his shappe and his organys not much
pereshyd / tha^ of a little seed to make all that gere new / and make a new
soul thereto. Now if ye never had seen any gonne in your days nor herd of any
before / if.ii. men should tell you the tone that he had wist a man in a pater
noster while conveyed and carried a mile of from one place to a another by miracle
/ and ye the other should tell you yt he had seen a stone more than a mannys
weight carried more than a mile in as lyttyll space by craft / which of these
would you by your faith take for the more incredyble? Surely q he both twain
were very strange. But yet I could not chese but think yt were rather true y^
god did ye tone / than that any craft of man could do the the other. well quod I
let us than to our thryde ensample. If it were showed you that saint
Etkenwalde or his s^ster drew out a piece of ti^ber yt was cut to short for
the rofe i^ making barkyng abbey / should this be so incredyble to you to
believe that they drew in lenght a piece of wood by ye power and help of goddys
hand / wha^ we se daily a great piece of silver brass / laten or iren drawn a
lenght i^to small wire / as wonderfully by mannys hand

The.xi. chapter
The author shewyth that a miracle is not to be mystrustyd though yt be done in
a small matter and semith upon a sleyght occasyon.

NOw though ye would paraduenture as ye seem to do / reken this cause very
sleyght for god to show sych an high miracle / sith there might have been without
miracle a longer piece of timber gotten / and so ye would happily mystrust yt for
the slender occasion / resemblyng yt to the myscastynge of some good huswyuys
kays / god has I wene so much wit of him self / yt he nedyth not our aduyce
to e^forme him what thing were suffycyent occasyon to work his wonders for.
But and if ye read in ye bokys of Cassyan / saint Gregory / saint Austyne /
saint Hyerom / and many other holy virtuous men / ye shall (except ye believe
the^ not) learn and know that god has for his saruantys don many a great
miracle in very small matters. And so much ye more ar we bounde^ to his goodness
in yt he vouchesauyth so famylyerly in small things to show us so great a toke^
of his mighty godhed. and no reso^ were it to wtdraw his tha^k and honor because
of his famylyer goodness. And if ye paraue^ture would not believe their wrytynges
/ go to Crystes gospel and look on his first miracle whether he might not have
prouydyd for wine without miracle. But such was his pleasure in a small matter
to do a great miracle for sum show of his godhed among them who^ he vouch
saufyd / where on the the other side before Herod that would fayn have seen sum
miracle where yt stood upon his life and might have delyueryd him from the
jews / yet would he not vouchsafe either to show the proud curyouse king one
miracle / or speak one word. So yt tymys placys and occasyons / reason is yt we
suffer to rest in his arbyterment. and not look to prescrybe and appoint at our
pleasure / and else blaspheme them and say we will not believe them.

The.xii. chapter.
The author sumwhat notyth the froward myndys of many folk that would be very
hard to believe a man in a miracle upon his oath / and very light in a shrewd
tale to believe a woman on her word.

NOw where ye require how many witness should be requisite and suffice to make
you thynk your self in reason to have good cause to believe so strange a thing /
me thynkyth yt right few were suffycyent of them that would say they saw a great
good thing done by the power and goodness of god. except it be hard for us to
believe either that god is so mighty yt he may do it or so good yt he would do it
But because ye would wit of me how many recordys were requysyte / ye thing
standyth not so much in number as in weight. Some twayn be more credyble than
sum.x. And albe yt y^ I se not greatly why I should mystrust any one that semith
honest and tellith a good tale of god in which there apperyth no special cause
of lyeng / yet if any wytnes will serve you / tha^ would I wit of you how many
your self would agree. For I now put case yt there came.x. diverse honest men of
good substance out of.x. diverse parties of the realm / ^che off them with an
offering at one pilgrimage / as for ensample at our Lady of Ipswych / and each
one of them affyrming upon their oath a miracle don upon them self in sum
great so dayn help well apperyng to pass the power of craft or nature / would
ye not believe yt among them all at the lestwyse twayn of those.x. said true? No
by our lady q he not and they were.x. and.xx. why so q I. Mary quod he for were
they never so many having none other witness but each man tellyng his tale for
him self / they be but syngle all and less than syngle. for every miracle
has but one record / and yet he not credable in his own cause. and so never a
miracle well prouyd. well said I / I like well your wisdom yt ye be so
cyrcumspect that ye will nothing believe without good suffycyent and full proof.
I put you than quod I a another case that.x. young women not very specially known
for good but taken out at aue^ture / dwelling all in one town / would report
and tell that a friar of good fame heryng their confessyons at a pardon / would
have given them in penance to let him lie with them / on your faith would ye
not believe yt among so many sum of the^ said true? yes yt I would quod he by ye
mary mas believe they said true all.x. and durst well swear for them and they
were but.ii. whi so q I they be as sigle witness as ye other of who^ I told you
before. for no^e of the^ ca^ tell what was said to a^ other and yet they be
vnsworn also / and therwyth be they but women which be more light and less to
be regardyd / dwelling all in one town also / and thereby might they ye more
easily conspyre a false tale. They be q he wytnes good ynogh for such a matter /
the thing is so lykely of yt self that a freer wylbe womanysh look the holy
horeson never so sayntly. ye deny not q I but god may as easly do a good turn
by miracle as any man may do an yuell by nature. That is true q he and he list.
well quod I se now what a good way ye be in / yt ar of your own good godly
mi^de more ready to believe ii. si^ple women yt a man will do noght / than.x.
or.xx. men yt god will do good

The.xiii. chapter.
Thauthor shows yt untoward mi^d of many me^ / which in miracles so hyely
touching ye honor of god and well of their own soulys / will neither believe
other folk yt tell the^ / nor the^ self vouchsafe to go preue the^. BUt sith yt
this kind of proof will not suffyse you / I dare say if ye would seek and
enquere / ye should fi^de many done in your days in ye presence of much people.
where should I se y^ q he? ye might q I upon good friday every year this.ii.C.
year till wtin this.v. year yt the turkys have take the town / have seen one of
ye thornys yt was in Crystes crown / bud and bring forth flowrys in ye seruyse
time / if ye would have gone to ye Rodys: So far q he ^ay yet had I lever have
goddys blessyng to believe yt I se not / than go so far therefore. I am well
apayd q I thereof. for if ye had lever believe than take the pain of a long
pilgrimage / ye will never be so styf in any opinion yt ye will put your self
in ieoperdy for pertynacy and stoborne sta^dyng by your part. No mary q he I
wara^t you I will never be so mad to hold till it wax to hot. For I have such
a fond fansy of mine own yt I had lever shyuer and shake for cold in y^ myddys
of somer / than be burnyd i^ y^ mids of winter. Merely said q I. but yet in
ernest where such a solemn yearly miracle is wrought so wo^dersly in the face
of the world before so great a multitude / it is a great untowardness in a thing
so hyly touching ye honor of god and health of our own soul / both to mistrust
all the^ yt sey they have seen it / and either of sloth or incrudelyte not
vouchsafe him self to prove it. If I should have gone quod he and found it a ly /
tha^ had I walked a wise journey. and o^ ye the other side if I should have seen
there such a thing my self / yet coud I scantly reke^ my self sure. No q I yt
were a strange case. Not very strange q he. For where ye speak of miracles done
before a multyrude / a man may be dysseyuyd therein right well.

The.xiiii. chapter.
The messe^ger makyth obieccyo^ y^ miracles showed before a multitude may be
feigned / and by ye author showed how y^ goodness of god bri^gyth shortly y^ truth
of such falshed to light / with e^sa^ples thereof one or two rehearsed. and farther
showed that many miracles therebe which no good christian man may deny to be true.

SOme pteste to bring up a pilgrimage in his peryshe may deuyse su^ false
fellow faynyng him self to com seek a saint in his church / And there suddenly
say that he has gotten his syghte. Then shall ye have the bellys ronge^ for a
miracle / And ye fo^d folk of the country soon made foles. Than women coming
thither with their ca^dells. and the person byyng of sum la^e beggar.iii.
or.iiii. pair of their old ^rutches with.xii. pens spent i^ me^ and women of
wex thrust through diverse places some with arrows / and su^ with rusty knyuys will
make his offeryngys for one.vii. year worth twyse his tithes. This is q I very
truth that such thyngys may be and su^time ^o be i^ dede^ As I remember me that
I have hard my father tell of a beggar yt in king Edwardes days y^ fourth came
with his wyffe to saint Albonys / And there was walkyng about the town
beggyng a five or six days before ye kings coming th^ther sayng yt he was
borne blind / and never saw in his life / And was warned in his dream y^ he
should co^ out of Berwyke where he said he had ever dwelled to seek saint
albo^ / And y^ he hade been at his shryne and had not been helped / And
therefore he would go seek hi^ at some other place / for he had hard some say
sin he ca^ / y^ saint albonys body should be at Colon / And in deed such a
co^te^cyo^ has there been. But of troth as I am surly i^formed he lies here
at saint albonys / saving some relyques of him which they there show shryned.
But to tell you forth wha^ the king was cu^me^ and y^ town full / suddenly
this blind man at saint Albonys shryne had his sight again / And a myracl^
solemply ronge^ / and Te deu^songen / so that nothing was talked of in all the
town but this miracle. So happened it than that duke hu^frey of gloucester a
great wise man and very well learned / having great Joy to se such a miracle /
called y^ pore man unto him And first showing him self ioyouse of goddys glory
so showed i^ y^ gettyng of his sight / and exortyng him to mekenes and to none
ascrybyng of any part y^ worship to him self / nor to be proud of the peoples
praise which would call him a good and a godly man thereby / At last he looked
well upon his eyes and asked whyther he coud never se nothing at all in all
his life before. And when as well his wife as him self affermed fastely no /
than he looked aduysedly upon his eyes again / and said I believe you very
well / for me thinks yt ye ca^ not see well yet. yes sir q he I thank god
and his holy marter I can se now as well as any man. ye ca^ quod the duke /
what color is my gown? Tha^ ano^ y^ beggar told hi^. what color q he is this
ma^nys gown? he told hi^ also^ and so forth without any stykkyng / he told him
the names of all the colors that could be showed him. And when my lord saw
that / he bad him walk faytoure / And made him be set openly in ye stokkys.
For though he could have seen ^oode^ly by miracle ye dy^ference bytweene
diverse colors / yet coud he not by ye sight so suddenly tell ye names of all
thees colors but if he had known the^ before no more tha^ y^ names of all y^
men that he should suddenly se. Lo therefore I say quod your friend who may be
sure of such thyngys when such pageantys be played before all y^ town. I
remember me now what a work I have hard of that was at lempster i^ y^ kings
fathers days where ye pryour brought preuyly a strange we^che i^to ye church
yt said she was sent thither by god / and would not ly out of ye church / And
aftere she was gratid wti^ ire^ grates above i^ y^ rood loft where it was
byleued yt she lived without any mete or drink only by a^gels fode. And diverse
times she was houseled i^ sight of ye people with a^ host vnco^secrate / and all
ye people loki^g upon / there was with a small here yt co^ueyd ye host from ye
pate^ of ye chalyce out of ye pryours hands i^to her mouth as though it ca^
alone / so that all the people not of the town only / but also of y^ con^rey
about / took her for a very quyk saint / and daily sought so thyk to se her /
that many yt coud not come nere to her cried owte alowd / ^oly maiden Elyzabeth
help me^ and were fayn to throw their offeri^g over their felows heddes for
prece. Now lay the pryour with holy mayde^ Elyzabeth nyghtly in the roode lofte
/ till she was after taken out and tried in the keeping of my lady the kyngys
mother. And by the longing for mete with voydaunce of that she had etyn which
had no sayntly savor / she was parceyuyd for no saint and confessyd all the
matter. In faith q I it had been great aluies ye pryour and she had been burnyd
to gether at one stake. what came of the pryour? Quod he that ca^ I not tell /
But I ween he was put to such ponishment as the pore nun was / that had
given her in penance to say this verse. Miserere mei deus / quoniam
conculcauit me homo. with a great thre^e that and she did so any more she should
say ye hole psalm. But as for holy may den Elsabeth I hard say she lyuyd and
faryd well / and was a come^ harlot at Calyce many a fair day after / where
she laughed at the matter full merely. The more pity q I that she was so let
pas. That is troth quod he. But now what say you what trust can we have / or
at lest way what suerte can we have in such thyngys when we se the^ faynid so
shamfully in the face of the world / and so much people abusyd so far / that
they would not have lettyd to swear / and some to ieopard their lyuys thereon /
that all this work was wroght by goddys hand till the troth came to light / and
yt drab driven out of the church in the dyuyls name. Uerely said I there was
abusyon in the tone side / and great folly in ye the other side. And as y^ noble
duke Hu^frey wisely found out the falshed of yt blyson beggar / so did that
noble lady the kyngys mother prude^tly decypher and found out that bestely
fylth. And to say the troth there was cause enough in both these parties
whereof the people might resonably gather so much suspicyon / yt if they had made
theruppo^ suffycyent inquysycion and search / they coud never have been so
far^e abusyd. For both might they well mystruste a beggars word whom they had
but newly known and well lykly to ly for to win fu^st favor and after money
/ And also men might well thynk that a young she saint was not metely to be
shrynyd quyk in a monastery among a meyny of monkys. And yet in conclusyon
because no such faynyd wonders should e^fane gods very miracles / his goodness
shortly brought them both to knowledge. And so does his especyall cure and
prouydence bring ever shortly such falshed and faytery to light to their
shame and confusyon. And as he did in Berna a great cite in Almayne bring to
knowledge ye falls miracles / whereby certain frerys abusyd the people / for
which they were openly burnyd. And so god always bryngyth such falls miracles to
light. Nay nay q he there be many such I warrant you yt never ^u^ to light /
and ar still taken for very good ye cannot very well warant yt q I. For sith
god brought to light y^ false faynyd miracle of ye prestes of the ydoll Bell
in y^ old time / as appetyth in the xiiii. chapter of y^ prophet Danyell / yt
is more likly y^ among cryste^ me^ he will suffer no such thyngys long lie
hyd. And also how can ye warraunte that many of th^se miracles be false.

For while there is no dowte but many be true / and ye know not any which ye
precysely know for false / ye be not sure whyther any be such or not. Mary
quod he y^ reason holds as well on the the other side. For sith I know not any
which I precysely know for true / I know not whither any be true or not. Nay
quod I that argument will not serve you so. For though no man bidith you to
believe yt every thing is true yt is told for a miracle / yet su^ there be of
which ye must nedys reke^ your self sure / and of which ye can not if ye be a
chryste^ man have any scruple or dowte. ye quod he? Feign would I wit which were
one of those. Mary quod I all y^ are written in the gospel. Mary quod he that
wot I well / but them we speak not of / for they were done by god him self.
why q I be they not so all. If ye will not agree y^ ye be not sure of any which
be told by saints / whatsaye you by the miracles of thapostels written by saint
luke. Nay q he ye mysse take me yet / for I do not mean any mistrust in the
miracles do^ of old time by god for his appostellys or holy marters in
coraboracyon and setting forth of the faith. I mean only these miracles that
men tell and talk of now a days / to be don at those Imagys where these
pylgrymagys be / and where we see su^ of them our self proved plainly false /
And yet told for so true / and so many false shrewes affirm it / so many siple
souls trust it / so much folyshe folk be live it / that a man may well with
reason mystrust all ye remnant. Ueryly quod I and yet I think that ^ryste
among christ people suffers not such thi^gys to happen often / nor such
delusyo^ to last long / but shortly (to their shame as yt has appeared in
some) does vt^^r ^ make open their falshed as him self said of all such.
That ye whysper one in an others ere shall be preched out a loud upon the rygge
of y^ house rofe.

The.xv. chapter
The author shows yt if of those miracles that are told and written to be
done at diverse pylgrymagys and co^mynly believed for very true / we certeynly
knew some falsely feigned / yet were that no cause to mystrust the remnaunt.

But be yt yt among so many miracles as be daily told and wryte^ do^ at diverse
pilgrimages / betwe^ which miracles and other why ye put a deference we shall
as I said before know ferther your mi^d hereafter / And be it also that of
such as long have be reputed and still taken for true / your self undoubtedly
knew sum for very false / would ye therefore thynk that among all y^ remnau^t /
there were never one true? what if ye find some fayer woman painted whose color
ye had went were natural / will ye never after believe that any woman in the
world has a fair color of her self? If ye find some falls flatterers that
long seemed fre^dly will ye take ever after all y^ world for such? If some
prove stark ipochrytes who^ the world would have sworn for good and godly me^ /
shall we therefore mystruste all other for their sake and wene there were none
good at all? By my troth q he I rode ons i^ good company / and to say y^ troth
for good company to walsyngha^ in pylg^^mage / where a good felows horse so fell
in halting yt he was feign to hyer a another and let him goo lose / which was
so lene and so pore and hallted so sore y^ empty as he was he could scant keep
foot with us. And when we had went we should have left hi^ behi^de / suddenly he
spyed a mare / and forth he lymped on three legs so lustely / that his masters
horse with four fete coud ^^a^t over take hi^. But wha^ he caught him and came
again / he swear in great anger all the othys he might swear yt he would trust
haltyng sir Thomas the worse while he lyuyd. what was that halti^g sir thomas
quod I. Mary q he their paryshe priest as he told us / as lene and as pore and
as halting as his horse / and as holy to. But syn he would while he lived
mystrust y^ halti^g priest for his halti^g horse / if I find an holy horeson
halte in ypochrysye / I shall not fail while I live to trust all his fellows
the worse. well quod I ye speak merely / but I wot well ye will do better what
so ever ye lay. Nor I a^ sure though ye se sum white safyre or byrall so well
counterfete / and so set in a ryng yt a right good iueller will take it for a
dyomound / yet will ye not dowt for all yt but yt there be in many other rings
all ready set right diamou^tes in deed. Nor ye will not mystrust saint Peter for

was so fully affermede y^ she at last believed it / and was she a Jew quod she
so help me god and halydo^ I shall love her y^ worse while I live. I a^ sure
ye will not do so / nor mistrust all for some neither men nor miracles

The.xvi. chapter
Thauthor shows that who so would enquere should sone find that at pylgrymagys
been daily many great and undoubted miracles wroght and well known. And
specially he speaks of the great and open miracle showed at our lady of Ippyl
wyche of late upon the daughter of Sir Roger went worth knight.

ANd as for y^ point y^ we spoke of concerning miracles done in our days at
diverse imagys where these pylgrymagys be / yet could I tell you some such done
so openly / so far from all cause of suspycyo^ / and thereto testyfyed in such
suf^ycyent wise / that he might seem almost mad yt her^g y^ hole matter will
mystrust ye miracles. Among which I durst boldelye tell you for one the
wonderful work of god that was wtyn these few years wroght in the house of a
right worshypfull knight sir Roger wentworth upon diverse of his chyldern /
and specially one of his daughters a very fair yo^ge gentle woman of.xii.
years of age in maruelouse manner vexyd and turme^^yd by our gostely ennemy the
devil / her mind alienated and rauyng with dyspisyng and blasphemye of god / and
hatered of all hallowed things / with knowleg and perse^uynge of the hallowed
from the unhallowed / all were she nothing warned thereof. And after that moved
in her own mind and moneshed by the will of god to goo to our lady of
Ippyswyche. In the way of which pilgrimage she prophesyed and told many
thyngys done and said at the same time i^ other placys which were proved true
/ and many things said lyyng in her trance of such wysoome and letnyng that
right connyng men hyghly marueyled to here of so young an vnlernede maiden when
her self wist not what she said / such thyngys vttred and spoken as well
learned men might have myssed with a long study, and finally being brought and
laid before the image of our blessed lady / ^as there i^ ye sight of many
worshypfull people so greuouslye turmentede / and in face eyene look and
countenance so grysely changed with her mouth drawn aside / and her eyene
leyd out upon her chekys yt yt was a terryble sight to behold. And after many
maruelouse thyngys at ye sa^e time showed upon diverse parssones by the devil
through goddys sufferau^ce / as well all the remnant as the maiden herself in
the presence of all the cu^pany restored to their good state perfitely cured
and suddenly. And i^ this matter no pretexte of beggyng / no suspycyo^ of
faynyng / no possybylyte of counterfettyng / no symplenesse i^ the seers / her
father and mother right honorable and rych sore abashed to se such chances in
their chylderne / the wytnes / great nou^ber / and many of great worship /
wisdom and good experye^ce / the maid her self to young to feign / and ye
fashyon it self to strange for any man to feign / And the end of the matter
virtuous / the vyrgyne so mouyd i^ her mind with the miracle / that she
forthwyth for ought her father could do / forsook the world and professed
relygyon in a very good and godly cumpanye at the mynoresse where she has
lived well and graciously ever syns.

The.xvii. chapter
The messenger laythe forth obieccyons against miracles do^e at pylgrymagys /
of which he confessyth many to be true. but he layth causes and reasons whereby
he seyth yt many men be moved to believe and thynk that those miracles yt be don
there be do^e by ye devil to set our hearts upon ydolatry by ye worshyppyng
of ymagys instead of god.

BUt now albe yt as I said yt I might allege you this miracle and prove yt
you in such wise that I wot well ye would be as far owte of all dowte thereof as
ye would be deep in the maruayle of the miracle / And peradventure diverse other
could I show you done of late at diverse pylgrymagys / and prove them well to
/ yet would I fayn first here of you / what dystynccyon and dyffere^ce is yt
that ye make / and wherefore ye make it bitwene ye miracles don of old time /
and these that be now adays don at these pylgrymagys. Sir quod he sum what a
little I towched yt in the beginning and made in manner a glaunce thereat. But
loath were I to hit yt with a full shot and a sharp as I have seen sum with
such reasons cleeue the pryk in twain / yt they semyd to bear over the but
And all^whych reasons I would be loath in so sore manner to allege / lest I might
happily give you su^ occasyo^ to thynk that either I set to sumwhat of mine
own / or else at the least wise lyked well that side and were a fauorer of ye
factyo^ / Nay nay quod I fere not that hardely / for neither a^ I so
suspecyouse to mystrust that one thynkyth evil because he defe^deth the worse
part well by way of argument and reasonyng / And also I trust that all their
shottes shall be so far to feeble to bear over yt but that few of them shall
towche ye mark / many to faint to perce the paper / And sum to high / and sum
to short / And some walk to wide of yt but by a bow. And therefore I require
you spare not to bring forth all yt ever ye have hard ^or that ye think may
be said in the matter. Sir quod he sith ye can here yt so indyfferently / I
shall not spare to speak it. And suerly to begin wtall yt I thynk true I will
not fail to confess. For albe yt that I have long stycked with you to
wythstand any credence to be given to miracles do^ now adays / in which I have
much ye le^get stykked because of sum whom I have known ere this so far from
ye believe of any miracles at all / yt in good feyth they put me half i^ dowte
whether they believe that there were god at all / if they du^st for dread and
shame have said all yt they seemed to thynk / yet to say the truth I never hard
any thing said so sore therein yt ever moved me to thynk yt any reason would bear
the importune mystrust of them / that among so many a^ open miracle as is daily
in diverse placys done / would wene that none at all were true. But verily as I
bego^ne a little to touch in the beginning whether these miracles be made by
god and for good sayntys or by ye devil for our deceyt and delusyon / albeyt
I believe and ever will as the church does / yet sum men among sum such things
say therein that I am dryue^ to do as I do in other articlys of the faith /
lene fast unto belefe for any reason that I find to make them a^swere with.
For first they take for a ground yt the devil may do miracles / Or if we list
/ not to suffer the^ called by yt name / the matter shall be thereby nothing
amended. for if we will have only called by the name of miracles thyngys by god
do^ above nature / yet will we not deny but that god sufferethe ye devil to
work wonders which the people ca^ not dyscerne from miracles. And therefore
when they se them / miracles shall they call them / and for miracles shall they
take them. Now sith yt so is that the devil may do such thyngys / whereby
shall we be ^ure that god does them? And sith the dyuyll may do them / and we
be not sure that god does them / why may not we as well believe that ye dyuyll
does them Mary said I ye told me that ye set noght by Logyk / but now ye play
the Logycyen out right. How be yt that argument men may torn o^ the the other
side and say / that sith god may do them much beter than the dyuyll / and we
be not sure that the dyuyll does the^ / why should we not rather believe that
god does them / which may do them beter. And myche more reason yt is where a
wonderful work is wrought there / to ascrybe yt to god the master of all
mastryes / rathere than the dyuyll that can do nothing but by su^fraunce /
except we se some cause that cannot suffer that work to be rekenyd goddys.
well q he / than is yt reason that we show you sum such cause. It is quod he
cause enough in that we se that god has in scripture forboden such ymagry /
and that under great maledyccyon / As in the law. Non facies tib^ sculptile.
And i^ the psalm. In exitu israel de egipto / where he furst by the mouth of
the Prophet / dyscrybyth the folly of such as worshyppyth those imagys / that
has cries and cannot here / handis and can not feel / fete and cannot go /
mouth and cannot speak. All which absurdytees and unreasonable folyes apperyth
as well in the worship of our images as in the panyms idollys. And after he
shewith the maledyccion yt shall fall theruppo^ / Seeing like mote they be to
them all such as make them / and all such as puttyth their trust in the^. And
forthwyth he declares in whom good men have their trust / and the profit that
procedyth theruppon saying. Domus israel sperauit in domino adiutor eoru^ et
protector eorumest / The house of Israel has put their trust in our lord
the helper and defender of the^ is he. Now when the wordys of god be clear /
open and plain upon this side / what reason is yt to believe the co^mentys and
glosys of men wherewyth ye would wind out against she true textys of god?
what should we give credens to the^nsample of me^nys doings against the plain
commandment of goddys wrytyngys. And when that only christ is our savior
and our medyatour to bring our nature again to god / and our oonly proctour
and aduocat before his father and may help us best and will help us most /
what shall we make either our lady or e^ny other creature our aduocat or pray
to the^ which of lykelyhod here us not / For there can none of them be present
at so many placys at onys as they be callede upon. and if they were / yet art
they no nere us then god hi^ self / nor so feign would that we did well as he
yt dyed for us. and therefore wha^ we not only do the^ reverence (which I were
content were done them for gods sake as ye said before) but also pray to them
/ we do christ and god great Injury. For if we pray to the^ as medytours and
advocates for us / we take fro Christ his office and give yt them. if we ask
help and health of them / then make we the^ plain god dys and betake to them
the power of ye godhed. For only god is yt yt geuethe all good as wytnessyth
saint James. Every good and very perfyte gift comes from above descendyng
from the father of lyghtys. And suerly if we consider how we behave us to the^
though ye say that all the honor given to saints redoundeth unto god / sith
yt is done as ye say not for their own sakys but for his / yet would not I
wene that god be well content that we should for his sake do to any creature
like honor as to him self. For scripture says that he will not give his
glory from him nor to any other creature like honor as to him self / And
therefore ye scolys as I here say deuyse a treble dyfference in worshyppyng /
calling ye one dulya the reverence or worship yt man does to man / as the
bond man to the lord. The second yperdulya that a man does to a more
excellent creature as to angellys or sayntys. The third latria the veneracyon
honor and adoracyon that cretures does only to god. In which of these parties
ye put the worshypping of imagys / I am neither so well seen therein to tell /
nor so curyouse greatly to care. But this I se well if any of all these.iii.
kinds of worship be better the^ other / thymages has yt. For they have all
that ever we ca^ do. For what do we to god when we do worship him in that
fassyon yt they call latria / but we do the same to sayntys and ymagys both?
if yt stand in knelyng / we knele to saintys and their ymagys. if in prayeng
/ we pray as bytterly to them as to god. if in sensyng and setting up of
ca^dyllys we cense them also and set some saint vii. candelles against god
one. So yt what so ever fassyon of worshyppyng latria be / the same is as
largely don to sayntys and images as to god / And this not unto ymagys only
(which though they have no life have yet some shappe and fassyon after man) but
as men wene unto pyggys bonys also sumtyme. For what reverent honor is there
daily don under ye name and oppynyon of a sayntys relyke / to sum old rotton
bone that was happily sumtyme as Chaucer says a bone of some holy Jews sheep.
Se we not yt someone sayntys head is shewid i^.iii. placys And some one hoole
sayntys body lies in diverse contres / if we believe the lies of ye people. And
in both the placys is yt one body worshypped where the one or the other is
false / and one body mystakyn for a another / an evil man happily for a good.
And yet will the prestes of both placys take offrynges and toll men theder with
miracles to. In which case either must ye say that the miracles of the one
place be false and feynid / or else that miracles make not your matter good
nor prove your pilgrimages true. and yet might all this gere be mich ye beter
born if it were true ye ye defend the things wtall / when ye say that in
worshyppyng of saints and ymagis men worship neither the tone nor ye the other as
goddys / but thyngys for the sayntys and the sayntis for god. But now as yt
seems the matter is i^ deed far otherwise / For the people pray to the sayntys
for their necessytys / putting thereto trust for their petycyons in the
sayntys them self as though god gave yt not but they. And in the ymagys put
the people their trust instead of the sayntys self / For albe yt that yt
might stand with reason as ye have a^swered me that presupposed the miracles
in these pylgrymagys to be done by god / ye people might then with reason goo
seek and vysyte such placys as god by miracle declared that he would have him
self or his holy sayntys sought and honored in / yet now this answer to
wcheth the point but in part and matcheth not the hoole matter / For the
people do not only vysyte these placys and there do all the worship to the
sayntys y^ they can possible do to god (with hope of their help from the
sayntys self / which they should well wit only to be geuin by god / and thus by
this demenour make the sayntys goddys fellawes / yt ^s to say the seruantys
matches with their master and the creaturs matys to the maker) but also use them
self in as relygyous fassyon / and as fervent affeccyo^ to the images of stone
or tree / as either to sait or god. And plainly take these images for the
sayntys self and for god him self. And put in these images of their
pylgrymagys their full hope and hoole trust yt they should put in god. which
besides that I have said before apperyth well in this / that they will make
comparyso^s between our lady of Ipswych and our lady of walsyngam / As weenyng
ye one image more of power the^ the the other / which they would never do / but if
i^ stead of our lady they put their trust in the Image self. And the people
in spekyng of our lady / Of all our ladies says one / I love best our lady
of walsingham / And I says the other our lady of Ipeswyche. In which wordys
what menyth she but her love and her affection to the sto^^ that standyth in ye
chapel at walsyngham or Ipswych.

what say you wha^ the people speak of this fassyon in their paynys and parellis
Help holy cross of Bradinan. Help our dear lady of walsyngham. Does yt not
plainly appear yt either they trust in the imagys in Crystys stead and our
ladys / lettyng Christ and our lady go / or take at the least wise those ymagys
so / that they wene they were verily the tone Christ the the other our lady her
self And so every way the faith and devotion wythdrawen from god that should
have yt and our hartys by these ymagys blinded and set upon the deed stocks
and stonys. Now se the good fruit also yt follows theruppon. I let pass over
the faytery and falsehede that is therein used among / sumtyme by the prestes
/ su^tyme by beggars in fayni^g of false miracles. Look what devotion men come
thither with. with the most com they that most abuse them self / such I mean
as most trust have and blind faith in these blind ymagys. But the most part
yt comes / commyth for no devotion at all / but only for good company to
babble thyderward and drink dronk there / and dance and rele homward. And yet
here is not all For I tell you nothing now of many a noughty pak / many a
flekke and his make that makes their metynges at these holsum hallows. And
many that seems an honest huswyfe at home / has help of a bawd to bring
her to myschefe as she walks abroad about her pylgrymagys. I hard onys when
I was a child the good scottysh freer father d^^^ld whom I reken suerly for a
saint if there be any i^ heuyn / I hard him prech at powlys cross that our
lady was a vyrgyn and yet at the pilgrymages be made many a foul metyng. And
loud he cried out. ye me^ of london gang on your self with your wyffys to
wyllesoon in the deuylles name or else keep the^ at heme with you with sorrow.
And surely so many good men wene yt were best / co^syderyng yt those vyagys
been but wanderyng abowte vanyte or supersticyous deuocyo^ / and the next door
to Idoletry when men have their af^eccyons instead of god bounden to blokkys
and stonys / And now sith that this gere is such / what marueyle is yt though
(as I said before) the devil be glad to give atte^daunce thereon / and do
for his part what he may to help his own deuycys forward? Or what marueyle
is yt though god in this cursyd world when we fall from him to other / and from
yt honor of him self to his sayntys / when we do as the Paynyms did instead of god worship ma^mottys / and all this by falling to follow mennys
glosys before his one textes / what wonder is yt though god again serve us as
he served the^ / and suffer the devil delude us as he did them / and make us
lene to falls miracles as we fall wylfully to falls goddys? Thus say they q he
that speak on yt side / And yet much more then I ca^ call to mind. But suerly
sith ye willyd me to forbere nothing / I have as I coud rather set to su^what
not of mine own opynyo^ / but of mine own inuencyon / then any thing left out
that I could remember which I had ever hard any man ley / to prove the
miracles done at pylgrymagys to be uncertain by who^ they be wroght / or rather
to prove that they should not be gods miracles but the deuyllys wonders.

The.xviii. chapter
The author dyfferreth thanswere to the forsayde obieccyons. and first by
scripture he proves yt ye church of christ can not err in any necessary
article of chrystys faith. And in this chapyter be those wordys of christ
specially touched. Super cathedram Moysi sederu^t. etc. Que dicu^t vobis
facite. que autem faciunt nolite facere / concerning the authoryte of the
church.

SUerly quod I for my part I ca^ you very good tha^k for ye have not fayntely
defendyd your part as though yt were a corruptyd advocate yt would by colusyon
ha^dell his clyentes matter feebly for the pleasure of his adversary / but ye
have said therein / I ca^ tell whether as much as any man may say / but certainly
I suppose as mich as ye either have hard any man say or ca^ your self say / And
at ye lest wise much more than I have hard of any man else / or coud have said
of my self. And vndowtyd as ye spoke of shotyng in the begynni^g / this gere
how nere it goes to the pryk we shall see after. But this I promise you yt
would fayn bear over the but and all. For if yt might hold and be bidden by /
and were as well ab^e to be prouyd true as I trust to prove yt falls / the but
we shote at were quite gone for any suerte yt we coud reke^ of our faith and
cristendome. But now to cum to the point / Sith yt is agreed all ready between
us / that at these ymagys and pylgrymagys miracles been there / either showed
by god for the comprobacyon of his pleasure theryn / or wonders wrought by the
dyuyll for our delusyon and dampnacyon / If it may either appear to us yt they
be not done by the dyuell / then will yt well follow yt they be done by god. Or
if it be prouyd to be done by god for the good of his chirch / then will it be
clear enough that they be no wonders wrought by the dyuell to the dysceyt of
christian people. And sith that either other of ^these parties prouyd / implies
the reprofe of your purpose / I will assay to show / and trust right well to
prove you the troth of our side by sum one of these ways or paradue^ture by
both / that is to wete as well in prouyng that god does these miracles / as in
reproving and confutyng yt they should be done by the dyuell. And furst would I
feign mete with your obieccyons and answer them forthwyth while they be fresh /
saving that me semith better for the while to differ them / forasmuch as sum
things therbe / wheruppon it will be requisyte yt we furst be both agreed:
without which we were like to walk wide in wordys and run at all riot so
lose / that our matter could another have ground / order / nor end. Now if I were
in this matter to dyspute with a paynym that would make the questyon betw^ne their
miracles and ours / albeyt I should have a clear matter in thend / yet must it
nedys be a long matter and much entryked or yt should cu^ at thend. And hole
bokys would yt hold / both the confutyng of theyrs and unto them thassertacyo^
of our own / specially for that they receive not our scripture / and between
them and us nothing common to ground upon but reason. And if we should
dyspute with a jew less labor should we have / sith that we should have with him
though he deny the new testamente / yet reason and ye old testament agreed upon
/ wherein we should not ^ary for the text but for ye sentence and understanding.
For therein we should have him styfly wythstande us. But now sith we shall in
our matter dyspute and reason with those that agree them self for christian
men / our dyspycyons is so much the shorter in that we must nedys aggree to
gether in moo thyngy^. For we must agree in reason where faith refusyth yt
not. And over that we shall agree upon the hole corpus of scripture / as well
the new testament as the old. But in the interpretacyon we may paraduenture
stykke. Is yt not so? yes quod he. well quod I / is there any other thing
wherein ye think that we shall vary / but the interpretacyo^ of the
scripture. Not that I remember quod he / except the scripture yt self wheruppo^
we talk / as of the worshyppyng of images or prayeng to sayntys / in which men
think there can be no great questyon if the scripture be well interpretyd. ye
do q I agree that such thyngys as arn me^cyonyd in the gospel spokyn by Christ
unto saint Peter and other his apostels and dyscyples / were not only said to
the^ self / nor only for them self / but to the^ for theyer successors in
Crystys flok / And by them to us all / that is to wete every man as shall
appertain to his part. whereby mean you that q he. I mean quod I as for
e^sample wha^ he said / Nisi abundauerit iusticia vestra plusquam Scribaru^ and
phariseorum / non intrabitis i^ regnu^ celorum. Except your justice abound and
excede ye justice of the Scrybys and pharesyes / ye shall never cu^ in heuyn.
And where he says If thou wylt enter into the kingdom of heuyn keep the
co^maundementys / did he not say such thyngys to them for all crystyn men yt
should come after? I think yes quod he for the second word concerning the
co^mau^dmentes. But as for the furst / that their justice should be better than
the justice of the scrybys and pharesyes / paraduenture he spoke specially to
his appostels them self / yt they should not be like ye scrybys and pharesyes /
which comaundyd other many thyngys / and did nothing them self. That is in my
mind quod I well taken. and so does holy saint Augustyne expoune it. But sith
ye think he said that word to his appostels specially rather than to all his
hole flok / whether think you that he said yt only to them / or else to all
other also yt should after come in their placis and succeed the^ in office? Nay
for god q he to all ye byshoppys he said yt and prelates and spyrytuall rulers
of his chirch yt ever shall be in ye church / forbyddyng them to bind and lay
upon other pore mennys bakkes importunable burdeyns / to the bering whereof
the^ self will not onys put forth a finger. Uery well said q I. what think you
than of that he said / Do ye such thyngys as they bid you do / but do not as
ye se the^ do? In that would our lord quod he yt all the people should do all
that the prelatys should co^mau^d as far as was co^maundyd in the law by god /
but he mente no further. And therefore he said that they sat upon ye chayr of
Moses. and he wyllyd that they should for ye cause be obeyed. And therein he meant
in such thyngys only as they should command / that were by god commaundyd the
people in the law given unto Moses. And that crystyn men in likewise shall
obey the byshoppys and prelatys / commaundynge only such thyngys as him self
has co^maundyd his people in his gospel and his own law. And in nothing else
q I? what meanyth yt than that our Lord in the parable of the Samarytane /
beryng ye wou^dyd man into ye inn of his church / and delyueryng him to the
host after that him self had dressyd his wounds with wine and oil / and
lef^e with the host the.ii. grotys of the two testame^tys / promised the host
beside / ye what so ever the host would bestow upon him more / he would when
he came again recompense him therefore? And also in that place that we spoke of
our Savior said that the Scrybys and pharesyes beside ye law of Moses on
whose sete they satt / did lay great fardellys and fast bound them on other
mennys bakkis / to the beryng whereof they would not move a finger the^ self. And
yet for all that he bad y^ people do what their prelatys would bid them / though
the burden were heavy / And let not to do yt though they should se the bydders do
clean the contrary. for which he addyd / but as they do / do not you. By our
lady q he I like not this gloss. For yt makyth all for the bo^dys / by which
the laws of the church bind us to more a do tha^ ye jews were almost with
Moses law. And I wot well Christ said cum to me ye that be ouerchargyd and I
shall refreshe you. And his appostels said / that the bare law of Moses
beside the ceremonys that were set to by the scrybys and the pharesyes / were
more than ever theye were able to bear and fulfill. And therefore christ ca^ to
call us into a law of liberte. And yt was in taking away the band of those
weary ceremonial laws. And therefore says our savior of the law yt he callyth
us unto / My yoke (says he) is fyt and easy / and my burdeyn but light.
whereby yt apperyth that he me^t to take away the strayte yoke and put on a more
easy. And to take of the heavy burdeyne and lay on a lyghter. which he had not
done if he would lade us with a fardell full of mennys laws mo tha^ a carte can
carry away. The laws of Christ quod I be made by him self and his holy spyryte
for the governance of his people / and be not in hardness and dyffyculte of
keeping any thing like to the laws of Moses. And thereof durst I for need make
your self judge. For if ye bethynk you well / I wene if ye were at this age now
to chose / you would rather be bounden to many of ye laws of Crystys church
than to ye cyrcumcysyo^ alone. Nor to as much ease as we wene that Christ
called us / yet be not ye laws yt have ^^ne made by his church of half the
pain nor half the dyffyculte that his own be / which him self puttyth in the
gospel / though we set aside the councellys. It is I trow more hard not to
swear at all tha^ to forswere / to forbere each angry word than not to ^ill /
continual wa^h and prayer the^ a few days appoyntid. Than what an anxyete and
solicytude is there in ye forberi^g of every ydyll word? what an hard thret
after the worldly co^pt for a small matter? Never was there almost so sore a
word said unto the Iues by Moses / as is to us by Christ in that word alone
where he sayethe that we shall of every idle word give account at the day of
iugmente. what say ye then by deuorsys restraynyd and liberty of diverse
wyuys wythdrawen / where they hade lyberte to wedde for their pleasure if they
cast a fantesy to any yt they took i^ the war. One of ye ware is enough quod
he to make any one man war. Now that is merrily said q I / but though one eye
were enough for a fletcher / yet is he for store content to keep twayn / and
would though they were sumtyme sore both and should put him to su^ pain / what
ease also call you this that we be bounden to abide all sorrow and shameful
death and all marterdum upon pain of perpetual da^pnacyon for the professyon
of our faith. Trow ye yt these easy wordys of his easy yoke and light burden
were not as well spoken to his apposteles as to you. and yet what ease called
he them to. Called he not them to watchynge / fasting / prayeng / preching /
walkyng / hunger / thurst / cold / and hete / betyng / scorgynge / prysonemente
/ paynefull and shameful death. The ease of his yoke stands not i^ bodily
ease / nor the lyghtnes of his burden stands not in the slaknes of any
bodily pain (except we be so want on that where him self had not heuyn without
pain / we look to cum thither with play) but yt stands in the swetnes of hope
/ whereby we feel in our pain a plesaunt taste of h^uyne. This is ye thing as
holy saint Gregory Nazanzeno declares yt refresshyth men yt arn ladid / and
makes our yoke easy and our burdeyn light. not any delyueryng from ye laws of
ye church or from any good te^perall laws either / in to a lewd lyberte of
slothful rest. For yt were not a easy yoke / but a pullyng of ye head out of
ye yoke. Nor it were not a light burdeyn / but all ye burden dyschargyd
contrary to ye wordis of saint poule and saint Peter both / which as well
understood the wordys of their master as these men do. And as a thing
co^sonant and well aggreable therwt do command us obedience to our superiors
and rulers one and other i^ thyngis by god not forboden all though they been
hard and sore. But see for gods sake how we be run a great way further the^
I thought to go when I begane / and have left yt we should go forth with all. It
is no loss quod he for there is a good thing well towched by ye way. well q I
let us go bak again where we left. sith ye agree yt christ spoke his wordys
not to his appostels only for their own time / but such thyngys as he said
to the^ he meant to al yt should follow the^ / And there of su^what he spoke to
the^ for ye prestys and bysshoppys only / As when he said / vos estes sal
terre / ye be ye salt of ye earth / and su^what to ye hole flokke as when he
said / Mandatu^ nouu^ do vobis vt diligatis inuicem sicut ego dilexi vos. I
give you a new co^maundment yt you love to gethere as I have louyd you / Tell
me the^ I require you / wha^ christ said to saint Peter / sathanas has desired
to sy^^e yt as men syfte corn / but I have prayed for y^ yt thy faith shall not
fail / said he this to h^ as a promise of ye faith to be by gods help
perpetually kept and preseruyd in saint peter only / or else in ye hole
church / that is to wete ye hole co^gregacyo^ of christen people professyng
his name and his faith and abydyng in ye body of the same / not being precided
and cut of / meaning yt his faith should never so utterly fail ^ his church /
but yt yt should hole and entyere abide and remayn theri^? Mary q he this is
good to be aduysed of. For though christ for yt more part such thyngys as he
spoke to o^e spoke to all / according to his own words / q vm dico o^nibus
dico / yt I say to one I say to all / yet su^ thyngis he said and meant
perticulerly as he spoke it. As when he bad saint peter cu^ upon ye water to
him / he bad not the remenaunte com so. And so may yt peradventure be yt this
word was spoken and meant toward Peter alone. That wylbe q I very hard to hold.
For his faith after failed. But sith that upon his first confession of the
right faith that christ was gods so^ / our lord made him his universal
vicare / and vndere him head of his church / And yt for his successor he should
be ye first upon who^ and whose ferme confessed faith he would bylde his
church / and of any yt was only man make him ye first and chief head and ruler
thereof / therefore he showed him that his faith / that is to wete the faith by
him confessed / should never fail in his church nor / never did yt / not
wythsta^dyng his denye^g. For yet stood still the light of faith in our lady
/ of whom we read in the gospel contynewall assystence to her swetest son
without fleyng or flytti^g And in all other we find either ^^ri^g from him one
time or other / or else doubt of his resurreccyo^ after his death (his dear
mother only except) For ye sygnyfycacyon and rememberaunce whereof the church
yearly in the ^enebre lessons leueth her ca^dyll burning still when all the
remnaunt that signyfyeth his appostels and dyscyples be one by one put out. And
sith his faith i^ e^tect failed / and yet the faith yt he professyd abode
still in our lady / ye promise that god made was (as it semith) meant not to him
/ but as head of the church. And therefore our lord added thereto / And thou
being one of these days conuertyd / conferme and strength thy brethern. In
which by these words our savior me^t and promised that ye faith should stand
forever. So yt the gates of hell should not prevail there against. Or else
might ye say yt these wordys spoken to saint peter / feed my sheep / was me^t
but for him self / and no co^maundmente to any successor of his or any
bishop or prelate. Andby that mean might ye say also that these words of
Chrystys promise made unto his dyssyples that the holy ghost should enstructe
them of all thyngys / were only mente for them self in their own parsons.
And not that ever he should e^structe his church af^ere their days. And
whenne he said wherso ever be.ii.or.iii.gathered to gether in my name there a^
I my self among them / we shall say by this means that he meant but of his own
dyscyples in his own time while he was here with them / and not that he would
be like wise present with such othere congregacyons i^ his church after. And
finally the^ were these wordys frustrat where he said. Lo I am with you all ye
days to ye worlds end. if he shude mean yt but with them that hard him speak
yt / then should yt appear yt he had intendyd a church only of them and for
their time / And them from their death hither all were don. Uerely sir quod he
I can well agree that all such thyngys was spoken by christ to make them sure
that the faith should never fail i^ his church / How be it if I durst doubt
in that point one thing is there that sumwhat styckethe in my mind. Doubt on
quod I between us twayn and spare not nor let not to tell me what moves you.
Sir q he I thynk yt god sets no more by faith the^ he does by charity. but
as for charity and good wor^es with virtuous living shall cool and decay in
the church as our sauyoure says i^ the.xxiiii.chapyter of matthew. Because
iniquite shall abou^d / yt charity of many men shall cool. And surely me
thynkythe it is well nere all gone all ready. God forbede quod I. For all be yt
yt yt greatly day by day decays and much people naught / yet be there many
good men abowte / and shall be allwey though they be few in co^paryson of the
multitude. And yet is yt not all one of other virtuous and of faith / yt is to
wete of knowledge and believe of tharticles of our faith. I mean of such artycles
as we be of necessyte bounden to believe. For albe yt that the flokke of christ
shall never lake good and devout virtuous people / yet shall both ye best be
sinners / and also much more ye multitude shall ever have the faith that I
speak of / tha^ shall have the goodness of living. why so q he. For.ii.causes q
I. one y^ malice of ye people whereby they will not be so redye to live well as
to believe well. for ye people the^ self will better keep ye faith the^ other
virtues / sith it is a thing of l^s labor to know what they should believe / and
to believe yt all so when they know yt / then yt is to work well. For though
the knowledge and believe bring many men to the labor of good workys / yet the
world commonly and the fraylete of our flesh with the^tycement of our gostly
e^mys make us wylli^gly and wyttyngly well knowing and beleuyng the good / yet
to walk in the worse. as does su^tyme the syk man that byleuynge his phisycyon
/ and having had also right often good proof by his own experyence to his
pain before / that su^ certain mete or drink shall do him harm / does yet
of an inportune apetyte fall for his little pleasure to his great pain and
hurt. A another cause is q I ye goodness of god / which how far so ever his
people fall from the use of virtue / shall not yet as him self has promised
suffer them to fall from the knowledge of virtue / not oonly for the
manyfestacyo^ of his iustyse yt their own conscience may condemn them i^
doing ye things that them self know to be naught / but also to thentent they
may still have among them a perpetual occasyon of ame^dment. For if the faith
were onis gone and the church of christ fallen in that error that they
believed vice to be virtue / and Idolatrye to be ye right way of goddys worship /
the^ had they no rule to gyde the^ to better. And therefore while we be not i^
error of understanding and faith / how so ever we fall or how often so ever
we sin / we see the way to turn again by grace to gods mercy. But if
faith were gone all were gone / and then had god here no church at all.

The.xix. chapter.
Thauthor proves yt if ye worship of ymagys were ydolatrye than the church
byleuyng hit to be lawful and plesaunt to god / were in a mysse believe and in
a dedely error. and tha^ were the faith failed in the church whereof christ
has promysede the contrary as is proved in the chapyter before.

SUerly sir quod he that god made not his church for a while but to endure
till the worldys end / that is there no christen man but he will well agree.
And sithe his church can not stand with owte faith which is the enter into
chryste^dom. for as saint poule says / accede^te^ ad deum oportet credere /
who so will cum to god must nedys believe / no man will deny but that faith is
and allwey shall be in his church. And yt his church not in faith only and the
knowledge of the truths necessary to be known for our soul health / but also
to the doing of good workys and auoydyng of evils / is / has been and ever
shall be specially gyded and gouernede by god and the secret inspyracyo^ of his
holy spirit. well quod I then if the church have faith yt erreth not in
believe. That is troth quod he. It should err quod I if yt byleuyd not all the
truths that we be bound to believe. what else q he. what and we believed quod
I all that is true / and over y^ sum other thing not only false but also
dysplesaunt to god / did we not then err in our necessary believe? whereby mean
you that quod he. As thus quod I / if yt one byleuid in all the three persons of
the trynyte / ye fader the so^ and ye holy ghost / and there with were persuaded
that there were a fourth person beside / equal and one god with the^. He must
quod he nedis err in his necessary believe / by which he is bounden to believe
in the trynite. And that fellow beleuyth in a quaternyte yt is quod I the hoole
trynyte and oone moo. But we be not only not bounde^ quod he to believe in any
mo / but also bounden not to believe i^ any mo. Uery well quod I. then erreth he
as much and as far lakketh his right believe that byleuyth to much as he that
byleueth to little / and he that byleueth sum thing yt he should not / as he yt
beleuyth not so^thi^g yt he should. what else quod he and what then. Mary this
quod I. if we believe that yt were lawful and well don to pray to sayntys / and
to reverence their images / and do honor to their relyques and vysyt
pylgrymages / And than where we do these thyngys they were in deed not well do^
but were dyspleasaunt to god / and by him reputed as a mynysshement and a
wythdrawyng of the honor dew to himself / and therefore before his mageste
reproved and odyous and taken as Idolatrye / were not this opinion a dedly
pestylent error in us and a plain lak of right faith? yes for god q he. But ye
grant q I that the church can not err in the right faith necessary to be
byleuyde / which is given and allwey kept i^ the church by god. Truth quod he.
Than follows it quod I that the church in that yt byleuyth sayntys to be
prayed unto / relyquys and images to be worshypped / and pylgrymagys to be
vysyted and sought / is not deceived nor does not err / but that the believe of
ye church is true therein. And theruppon also folowith that the wonderful
workys done above nature at such ymagys and pylgrymagys at holy relyques by
prayours made unto saints / be not done by the devil to delude the church of
christ therwyth / sithe the thing that the church does / is well do^ and not
Idolatrye. But by the great honor do^ unto sayntys god him se^f the more
hyghly honored in that his seruantys have so much honor for his sake. And
thereof follows yt that him self makyth the miracles in comprobacyo^ thereof.
Also if it be true that ye have grauntyd that god kepyth and ever shall keep in
his church ye right faith and rygh believe by the help of his own hand that
has plantyd yt / then can it not be that he shall suffer the devil to work
wonders like unto his own miracles to bring his hole church in to a wrong
faith. And then if those thyngys be not done by the devil / I trow ye will
not then deny but they be done by god. And so is yet again our purpose double
prouyd. First in y^ ye grant that god will not suffer his church to err i^
his right faith / secu^dly which pursues theruppo^ by that he has by many a
vysable miracle declared yt this faith and manner of obseruau^ce is very
plesaunte and acceptable unto him. which miracles sithe they been prouyd to be
don upon good ground and cause / appear well to be do^ by god and not by our
gostely enmy.

The.xx. chapter
The messenger alleggythe that ye perpetual being and assystence of christ
with his church to keep yt owte of all damnable errors / is nothing else but
his being with his church in holy scripture. whereof the authore declares the
contrary.

HOw think you quod I is there any thing in this matter amysse. I can not well
tell q he what I might answer thereto. But yet me thynkyth that I come to this
point by some ouersyght in grauntyng. well quod I men say sumtyme when they
would say or do a thing and cannot well come thereon but mysse and over se them
self in the assay / yt makyth no matter they say ye may begin again and mend
yt for it is another mass nor mattins. And al be yt in this matter ye have
nothing granted but that is in my mind as true as the matein^ or y^ mass
either / yet if ye reken your self over swyfte i^ granting / I give you leave
to go bak and call again what ye will. In good faith quod he full hard were it
in mine own mind otherwise to thynk / but ye god shall allway keep the right
believe in his church. But yet sithe we come to this conclusyon by the
grauntyng thereof / let us look onys again thereuppon. And what if m^ would say
as I hard onys own say my self / ye god does peradventure not keep always
faith in his church / to give the^ warnyng with when they do well and when
the contrary / But sith he has given the^m and left with them the scripture
i^ which they may suffycye^tly see / both what they should believe and what they
should do / he lets them alone therwyth without any other special cure of
his upon their faith and by lefe. For therein they may see all yt the^ nedyth
if they will look and labor theri^. And if they will not / ye fault is their
own sloth and folly. And who so be wyllyng to mend and be better / may always
have light to se how / by recours to the redyng of holy scripture / which shall
stand him i^ like stead as ye said before ye god kept the faith for / by his
special menys in his church. if this q I were thus / whereof should christ's
promise serve? Ego vobiscu^ sum o^nibus diebus vsque ad finem secult. I a^ with
you all the days till the end of y^ world? wherefore should he be here with his
church / if his being here should not keep his right faith and believe in his
church? Mary q he these wordys well agrees with all. for god is and shall be
until the worlds end with his church in his holy scripture. As Abraham
answered the rich man in hell seyeng they have Moses and the prophites / not
meaning that they had the^ all at that time present with the^ but only yt they
had their boyks. And so christ for asmoche as the scripture has his faith
comprehendyd therein according to his own words / Scrutamini scripturas / quia
scripture sunt qtestimonium perhibent de me / Search you the scryptures for
they bear witness of me. therefore he said / Ego vobiscum sum vsque ad finem
seculi / I am with you to thend of the world / because his holy scripture shall
never fail as long as the world endures. Heuyn and yerth says he shall
pass away but my words shall never pass away. And therefore i^ his holy
wryti^g is he with us still / and theri^ he kepyth and techeth us his right faith
if we list to look for yt / and else as I said our own fawte and folly yt
is. if god quod I be none otherwise with us but i^ holy scripture / then be
those wordys of christ / I am with you to y^ worlds end / su^what
straungely spoken / and unlike ye words of Abraham whereunto ye resemble the^.
For christ left never a book behind him of his own making as Moses did and
the profytis. And in their bokys was he spoki^ of as he was in the gospel.
wherefore if he had spoken and meant of scripture / he would have said that they
should have with them still his euangelystes and writers of his gospels as
Abraham said they have moses and the prophetis / which were the writers of the
bok^s that the ie^es had. Christ also said / I am with you till thend of the
world / not I shall be / but am. which is the word approp^yed to his godhed.
And therefore that word am / is ye name by which our lord ^^^d ^s he told Moses
/ be named unto pharao / as a name which from all cretures (sith they be all
subget to time) clerly dyscernyth his godhed / which is ever being and present
wythowte dyfference of time paste or to come. In which wise he was not in his
holy scripture / for yt had beginning. And at those wordys spoken / was not yet
all written. For of the chief part which is the new testament / there was yet at
that time never on word wreten. And also we be not sure by any promis made that
the scripture shall enoure to the worlds end / albeit I thynk verily ye
substance shall. But yet as I say / promise have we none thereof. For where
our lord says yt his words shall not pass away / nor one ^ote thereof be
lost / he spoke of his promyses made in de^e as his faith and doctrine taught
by mouth and inspyracion / Not that the writing should never be lost / o^ whyth
sum parties be all ready lost / more per adventure then we can tell of. And of
that we have / the bokys in sum part^ corrupted with mysse writing. And yet
the substance of those wordys that he meant ben known / where sum part of the
writing is unknown. He says also that his father and he should send the holy
ghost / and also that he w^lde co^ him self. whereto all this if he me^t no
more but to leave the bokys b^hynd them and go their way? Christ is al so
present am^ng us bodyly i^ the holy sacrament / And is he there present with
us for nothing? The holy ghost taught many things / I thynk unwritten / and
whereof sum part was never comprysyd i^ ye scripture yet unto this day / as
the article which no good christen man will doubt ^f / that our blessed lady
was a perp^tuall vyrgyn as well after the birth of christ as before. Owre
savior ^lso s^y^ unto his Apposteles / that when they should be accused and
brought in Judgment / they should not need to care for answer / yt should even
the^ he put i^ there minds. And that he mente not only the remembrance of holy
scripture / which before the paynym iuges were but a cold and bare allegyng /
but such words new given them by god inspyred in their hertes so effectual
/ and co^fermid with miracles / yt their adversaries though they were angry
thereat / yet should not be able to resyste yt. And thus with secret help and
inspiracion is christ with his church / and wylbe to ye worlds end present
and assystent. Not only spoken of in writing.

The.xxi. chapyter
The author shows that if yt so were in deed as the messenger said / that is
to wytt that christ co^tynued with his church none other wise but only by the
leuynge of his holy scripture to them / and that all the faith also were only
therein / tha^ should it yet follow that as far as ye necessyte of our salvation
requires / god gives the church ye right vnde^sta^dyng thereof. And theruppon
follows ^arther that the church can not err in the tyght faith. whereupon is
inferred e^te sone / all yt the messe^ger would have fled fro before. And ther^n
also specially follows / that ^ll the tex^es of holy scripture which
herytyques allege against images or any point of the comen believe of Chrystys
catholic church / can no thing serve their purpose.

BUt now would I wit / sith ye reken him none other wise present the^ in holy
scripture / whether the^ does he give his church the right understanding of
holy scripture or not? what if he do not quod he. Mary quod I then your self
sees well / that they were as well wythowte. And so should the scripture stand
them in as good stead / as a pair of spectacles should stand a blind freer.
That is very truth quod he. But therefore has his wysdom and goodness provided
yt so to be wreten / that yt may be well understood by the collacyo^ and
consyderacyon of one text with a nothere. May yt not also be q I that sum of
them which do read it dilygently / and dylygently compare and consider every
text how yt may stand with other may yet for all that mistake and
mysunderstande yt? yes quod he yt may be so. For else had there not ben so
many herytykes as there has been. Uery truth quod I. But now if all the faith
be in holy scripture / and no part thereof any where else / but that yt must
be therein all to gether lernyd / were yt then suffycyent to understand sum
part aryght and sum other part wrong in the necessary points of our faith /
or must we as farforth as co^cernith ye necessyte thereof mysunderstand no
part? we must q he mystake no part as far as necessaryly co^cernith our
faith. But we must have so the right understanding of all to gether / that we
conceive no damnable error well said quod I. Then if we must we may. For if
we may not we must not. For our lord byndyth no man to a^ i^possybylyte. we
way q he. If we may q I / the^ may we either by good hap fall in the right
understanding / or else by natural reason cu^ to it / or else by supernatural
grace be ledd into it. That is tr^th q he needs must it be one of these way^.
well q I we will not yet e^serch which. But I would furst wit whether Christ have
a church in the world co^tynually / and so shall have to ye worlds e^d / or
else has one sumtyme and su^tyme no^e at all. As we might thynk yt he had on^
while he was here him self and peradventure a while after / and hapely none at
all never sythy^s / nor shall not again we wot nere when. Nay q he yt can not
be in no wise / but yt he must nedys have his church co^tynew still su^ where.
for else how coud he be with them co^tynually to ye worldys end in scripture or
other wise / if they with who^ he promisyd to b^ and contynew to the worldys end
/ should not contynually so long endure? Or how could those words of christ be
true Lo I am with you all ye days to the worldys end / if before ye worlds end
he were away sum days / as he were in deed fro ye church sum days / if in su^
days he had no church. well quod I yet would I wit one thing more. Can he have a
church without faith. Nay quod he that were i^possyble. Forsooth quod I so were
it. for his church is a congregacyo^ of people gathered into his faith And
faith is the furst substa^cyall dyfference dyscernyng christian men from hethen /
as reason is the diff^rence deuydyng man from all the kyndys of brute be^^ys.
Now then if his church be and ever shall be contynuall without any times
between / in which there shall be none / and without faith yt may never be /
and no part of the faith is as ye say else where had but in holy scripture
and all yt must be had / and also as we were agreyd a ^ytyll while before /
there must be non error adioynid thereto / and therefore as far as touches the
necessyte of feyth no part of scripture may be miss taken / but all must be
understood right / and may be right understood either by hap reason our
help of grace / yt necessaryly folowethe that by one or other of these ways /
ye church of Christ has always and never faylethe the right understanding of
scripture / as fare as longethe for our necessyte. That follows in deed q he.
well quod I / let pass for the while. what foloueth further? And ^yth the
church so has / let us first aggree by which of these.iii. ways the church
has it. why there by hap / reason / or grace. By hap quod he were a poor
having. For so might yt hap to have and hap to fail. Then quod I sithe yt
has yt ever / it can not be by hap. what thi^^ you then of reasone? As little
quod he as any man thynkethe. For I take that for plain enmye to faith. ye
take paradue^ture wrong quod I. But thereof shall we se further aftere. But now
sith ye so thynk / ye leave but the third way / which is the help of grace. No
surly quod he. Ueryly quod I where reason may between diverse textys stand in
great doubt which way to lene / I thynk that god with his holy spyryt ledeth
his church into the consent of the truth / As him self said / that the holy
ghost who^ he would send / should led them i^ to all troth. And thus by the
help off his grace as ye grant / ye right vnderstandi^g of scripture is ever
preserved i^ his church from all such mystakyng / whereof might follow any
damnable error concerning the faith. And thereof does there first follow / that
beside the scripture self there is an other present assystence and special cure
of god / perpetual with his church to keep yt i^ the right faith / that it
err not by mysse understanding of holy scripture / contrary to thoppynio^
that ye purposyd / when ye said yt Chrystys being with his church was only
the leuyng of his holy scripture to us. And over this if god were no another
wise present then ye speak of / yet sith yt is proved that his church for all
yt / ever has the right understanding of scripture / we be common to y^ same
poi^t again that ye would so feign flyt from. For if the scripture and nothing
but ye scripture does contayn all thing yt we be bounden to believe and to do
and to forbere / and yt god also therefore prouydeth for his church the right
vnde^standyng thereof / concerning every thing necessary for us that is
co^teynid i^ scripture / the^ must there needs follow theruppon the thing yt ye
feryd / lest ye had wrong and vnaduysydly grauntyd / that is to wit / that god
always kepyth the right faith in his church. And theruppo^ follows further the
remanant of all that is in questyon between us / that the faith of the church
in ye worship that yt beleuyth to be well geuyn unto sayntys / relyques and
ymagys / is not erronyous but right. And there upon follows also that the
miracles done at such places ben none illusyo^s of dampened sprytys / but the
mighty hand of god / to show his pleasure in the corroboracyon thereof / and
in the excytacyon of our deu^cyon thereto. In deed quod he we be cu^ bakk here
with going forward / as men walk in a mase. ye have not yet quod I lost all
that labor. For though ye have half a chek in this point / yet have ye if ye
perceive yt matyd me in a another point / by one thing that is aggreed between
us now. what is that quod he / This quod I yt I have aggreed as well as you that
god has geuyn his church the right understanding of scripture in as
farforthe as longs to the necessyte of salvation. In what point quod he has
that matyd you? why quod I se you not yt? Nay then will I not tell you but if
ye hyre me / or if I tell you yet shall ye not win the game thereby. For sith
ye se yt not your self / yt is but a blind mate. Let me know yt yet quod he
/ and I am aggreyd to take none advantage thereof. On that bargeyn be yt quod
I. ye wot well quod I that against the worshyppyng of ymagys and prayng to
sayntys / ye laid certain textys of scripture to prove it forboden and reputed
of god for y^olatrye. For answer whereof when I leyd the sentence that the
church and holy doctors / there of give to those textys / ye said they were
but mennys false gloses against gods true textys. And now sith ye grant and
I also that the church can not mysunderstand the scripture to ye hynderaunce
of ye right faith i^ things of necessite / and that ye also knowledge this
matter to be such / that yt must either be the right bileue and acceptable
service to god / or else a wrong and erronyous oppynyon and plain ydolatry /
yt follows of necessyte that the church does not mys vnderstan^e those textys
that ye or any other can allege and bring forth for that purpose / But that all
these textys be so to be taken and vnderstande^ / as they nothing make against
ye church / but all against your own oppynyo^ i^ this matter. And this have ye
suddenly answered your self to all those textys out of hand / with a gloss of
your own as true as any text in the bible / and which all the world will
never aduoyde except they would make the scripture serve the church of naught /
or rather to their hi^deraunce then fortheraunce in the faith. For ^^ were yt
if yt might be / yt god gives them not the good understanding thereof / but
suffers the^ to be deceyuyd and deluded in errors / by the miss taking of the
letter. Mary quod he this is a blind mate in deed. Suerly quod I these.ii.
thyngys seem to me two as true poyntys and as plain to a chryste^ man as any
petycyon of Euclidis geometry is to a reasonable man. For as true as yt is
that every hole thing is more then his own half / as true is yt in deed /
and to every chryste^ man faith makyth yt as certain / First ye Chrystys
church can not err in any such article as god upon pain of loss of heuyne
will that we believe. And thereuppon necessaryly folowyth / that there is no
text of scripture well understood / by which crystyn people arn co^mau^dyd
to do the thing which the church beleuyth yt they may lefully leave undone / nor
any text whereby we be forbode^ any thing / which ye church believes that they
may laufully do.

The.xxii. chapyter
Because the messenger had in y^ bygynnynge showed him self desyrouse and
gredy upon the text of scripture with little force of the old fathers glosys
/ and with dysprays of philosophy and almost all y^.vii. lyberall scyences / ye
author therefore incyde^tly shows what harm has happed sumtyme fall to
diverse of those young me^ who^ he has known to give their study to the
scripture only / with contempt of Logyke and other seculer science / and
little regard of the old interpretours. wherefore the authore shows that in
the study of scripture / the sure way is with vertewe and prayour / furste to
use the iuggement of natural reason / whereunto seculer lytterature helpyth
much / And secondly the co^mentes of holy doctors / And thyrdly above all
thing the artycles of the catholyque faith receyuyde and beeleuyd through the
church of Christ.

ANd for because we speak often scripture now / and yt the church in thyngys
nedely requysyte to salvation has the right understanding of holy scripture
/ wherein I parceyue ye be studyouse of the text alone without great force of
the old fathers inte^pretacio^s or any other scye^ce / of which ye reken
all.vii.save gramer almost to sarue for noght / I have of you so good oppynyon
/ that I trust all your study shall torn you to good. But suerly I have seen
to sum folk so much harm to grow thereof / that I never would advise any man else
in the study of scripture to take that way. why so quod he. For I have known q
I right good wyttys that has set all other learning aside / partly for sloth
refusing the labor and pain to be susteynyd in yt learning / partly for
pride by which they coud not endure the redargucyon that should sometime fall
to their part in dyspycyons. which affeccions their inward secret favor
toward the^ selfys coueryd and cloked under the pretext of symplycyte / and
good cryste^ devotion borne to ye love of holy scripture alone. But in little
while after ye da^pnable spyryte of pride ye unware to the^ self lurked in
their hearts / has begone to put out his hornys and show himself. For then
have they longed under the praise of holy scripture to set out to the show
their own study. which because they would have (...) the more to be set bye /
they have furste fallen to the dysprays and derysion of all other dyscyply^es.
And because in speaking or prechyng of such commune thyngis as all cryste^ men
know / they coud not seem excellent / nor make it appear and seem yt in their
study they had don any great mastry / to show themself^therfore maruelouse /
they set out paradoxis and straung oppynions against the come^ faith of
Crystys hole church. And because they have therein the old holy doctors
against them / they fall to the co^tempte and dysprayse of them / either
preferrynge the^re own fond gloses against the old cunning and blessed
fathers interpretacyo^s / or else lene to some words of holy scripture that
seem to say for them / against many motextis that plainly make against the^ /
without receyuyng or ere gyuyng to any reasone or authoryte of any man quykke
or deed / or of the hole church of Christ to the contrary. And thus onys
proudely parswaded a wrong way / theye take the brydell in the teeth and
run forth like a head strong horse / that all the world cannot pluk them
bakke. But with sowynge sedycyon / setting forth of errors and heresies / and
spycyng their prechyng with rebukynge of preesthod and prelacye for the
peoples pleasure / they turn many a man to ruin and them self also. And
^hen the dyuell dysseyuyth them in their blind affeccyons. They take for good
zele to the people their malycyous envy / And for a great vertew their
ardente appetyte to preche / wherein they have so great pride for the peoples
praise / that prech I wene they would though god would his own mouth command the^
the contrary. why should ye wene so quod he / or whereby can ye be sure that ye
do not now mysconster their good mind? hard is it oftymys to judge an other
mannys deed yt has sum appare^ce of yuell / because the purpose and entente
may make it good. And whatt parell is it then where the deed apperyth good /
there to judge the mind and intent for naught / which who can se but god? As
the scripture says / Dominus autem intuetur cor. Only god beholdyth the
heart. And therefore says our sauyouriuge not before the time. I judge not quod
I but upon open things and well apparent. For I speak but of those whose
erronyous oppynyons in their prechyng / and their obstynate pride in the
defense of their worldely worship well declaryth their myndys. And sum have I
seen which when they have for their parylous prechynge been by their prelatys
prohybytyd to preche / have that not wtstandyng proceeded on still. And for ye
mayntenaunce of their dysobedience / have amendyd the matter with a^ heresy /
boldly and stubburnly defendyng / that sith they had conning to preche / theye
were by god bounden to preche / And that no man nor no law that was made or
coud be made / had any authoryte to forbede them. And this they thought
suffycyencly prouyd by the words of thappostell / Oportet magis obedire deo
quam hominibus. As though these me^ were appostels now specially sent by god to
preche heresies and sow sedycyon among christian men / as the very appostels
were in deed sent and co^maundyd by god / to preche his very faith to the
jews. One of this sort of this new kind of prechers being demaundyd why yt
he vsyd to say in his sermons about / that now a days men preached not well the
gospel / answered that he thought so because he saw not the prechers
parsecutyd / nor no strife nor bysynes arise upon their prechi^g. which
thyngys he said and wrote was the fruit of the gospel / because Christ said /
Non vem pacem mittere sed gladium. I am not come to send peace in to the world
but the sword. was not this a worshypfull understanding / yt because Christ
would make a division among infidels / from the remanaunt of them to win some
/ therefore these appostels would sow some cocle of dyssension among ye christian
people / where by Chyste might lose some of them? For the fruit of strife among
the herers and parsecucio^ of the precher cannot lightly grow among christian
men / but by the prechinge of some strange newelties / and bringynge up of
some new fa^gell heresies to the infeccio^ of our old faith. One wist I that
was for his partinacie in that oppynio^ / yt he would and might and was bounden
to preche any prohibicyon not wythstandynge / when he was aftere diverse bold
and open defense thereof at last before folk honorable and few / reasoned
withal / and not only the law showed him to the contrary of his oppynion /
which law was made at a general counsel / but also by plain authoryte of
holy scripture prouyd that his oppinion was erronyous / he so parceyued him
self satysfyed yt he mekely knolegyd his error / and offryd to abjure it and
to submyt himself to penance. But on the morrow when he came forth in open
presence of the people / and there saw many that had often hard him preche / of
his secret pride he fell in such an open passion of shame / that those should
here him go bak with his word which had before had his sermons in great
estymacyo^ / that at the first syghte of the people he reuokyd his reuocacion
and said out alowd that he might well be hard / yt his oppynyon was true /
and that he was yt day before deceyuyd in that he had confessyd yt for false.
And thus he held his own stubburnly without reason till the bookys were showed
him again / and him self red them before all the people / so that he parceyuyd
the audyence that stood about him to feel and understand his proud folly in
the defense of his indefensyble error. And theruppon at the last yielded him
self again. Such secret pride had our gostely enemy conveyed in to the heart
of him / which I ensure you semyd in all his other outward manner as meke a
simple soul as a man should have seen in a summers day. And some of the^ let
not with lies and pariury to defend them self / and some to stand in defense
of their errors or false denyenge of their own deed / to their great parell
of the fire / if their judges were not more marcyfull then their malice
deseruyth. And all this do^ne because (as them self does at last confess)
they think if theye abjure / theye shall not after be suffered to preche again.
Such a scabbyd ych of vayn glory catch they in their prechynge / that though
all the world were the worse for yt and their own life lie thereon / yet would
they long to be pulpetyd. And this I say has comen of su^ that have with
contempt of all other lernyng given the^ to scripture alone. whose affeccyons
of pride and sloth has not in the beginning been parceyuid to them self /
but have accomptyd their vycys for devotion. would ye then quod he condemn y^
manner of study by which a man has so great affection to ye scripture alone /
that he for the delight thereof felyth little sauoure in any thing ^ls / but that
we should lose time in philosophy the mother of heresies and let scripture
alone? Nay quod I that mind am I not of. There was never thing written in this
world that can in any wise be co^parable with any part of holy scripture.
And yet I think other lyberall science a gift of god also / and not to be
cast away / but worthy to wait and as handemaydys to give attendau^ce upon
divinity. And of diuinyte rek^^ I the best part to be co^teynyd in holy
scripture. And this I say for him that shall have time thereto / and from youth
entendeth to the church ward / and to make him self with goddys help met^ for
thoffyce of a precher. How beyt if any man either happen to begin so late / yt
he shall paraduentu^e have no time thereto / or else any man of youth to have
that fervent appetyte unto scripture yt he cannot find in his heart to read any
thing else (which affeccion who so hapeth to have given him / is very fortunate
if he with grace and meekenes gyde it well) then would I council him specially
to study for the virtuous framyng of his own affeccyons / and using great
moderacyon and temperaunce in the prechynge to other men. And in all thing to
flee the desire of praise and show of co^nyng / ever mystrustyng his own
inclynacyons / and live in dread and fear of the dyuyllis subtell sleyghte and
inuencions. who though he lie in contynuall awayt upon every prechour to cach
him into pride if he can / yet his highest enterprise and proudyst triumph
standyth in ye bryngyng of a man to the most abuse of that thing / yt is of
his own nature ye best. And therefore great labor makyth he and great bost / if
he bring it about / that a good wit may abuse his labor bestowed upon the
^^udy of holy scripture. For the sure auoydyng whereof / my poor aduyce were in
ye study thereof / to have a special regard to the wrytinges and co^mentys of
old holy fathers. And yet or he fall in hand with the tone or the the other next
grace and help of god to be gote^ with abstyne^s and prayour and cle^nes of
lyui^g / before all thing were it necessary to come well and surely enstructyd
in all such poyntys and artycles as ye church beleuyth. which thyngys onys
fyrmly had and fastely for vndowtyd trouthes presupposyd / then shall reason and
they be two good rulys to examyne and expown ^ll doutfull textis by / sith ye
reder shall be sure that no text is so to be vnder^^ande^ as it stands
against the^ both or against any point of the catholyke ^ayth of Crystys
church. And therefore if yt seem to stand against any of the^ / ^yther shall the
light of natural reason with the collacyo^ of other textys / help to find out
the truth / or else (which is ye surest way) he shall perceive ye truth in ye
co^me^tys of the good holy doctors of old / to who^ god has given ye grace of
understanding. Or finally if all yt he can either find in other me^ny^ workys
/ or invent by goddys aid of his own study / can not suffyce to satysfy / but
yt any text yet seem unto him contrary to any point of ye churchys faith and
belefe / let him then as saint Augustyne says / make him self very sure yt
there is some ^aut either in the tra^slatour / or in the writer / or now a days
i^ ye prynter / or finally that for some one let or other he understands yt
not a right. And so let him reuere^tly knowledge his ignorance / lene and cleue
to ye faith of the church as to an vndoutyd trothe / leuing ye text to be beter
parceyuyd when it shall please our lord with his light to reuele and disclose
it. And in this wise shall he take for a sure way / by which he shall be sure of
one of two thyngys / that is to wit either to parceyue and understand the
scripture right / or else at the lest wise never in such wise to take it wrong /
that ever may turn his soul to parell.

The.xxiii. chapyter
The messenger obiectyth against the council of the author / in that he would
yt the stude^t of scripture should lene to the co^mentours and unto natural
reason / which he callyth enmy to faith. And theruppon thanswere of thauthor to
those obiectyons / specially prouyng y^ reason is servant to faith and not enmy
/ and must with faith and interpretacyon of scripture nedys be concurraunt.

SIr quod he I will not say nay but this way will do well. Howbeyt I fere me
yt we were lykly to byld up many errors / if we square our timber and stonys by
these.iii. rulys / me^nys glosys / reason / and faith not that we find in
scripture / but that we bring with us to scripture. For furste as for the
co^mentours that y^ speak of / either their commentys tell us the same tale that
the text does / or else a another. If they tell me the same / I believe them
only because the text says the same. and if they tell me a another / than
believe I them not at all nor naught I should / except I should believe men better
than god. And for as for reason / what greter enmy can ye find to faith tha^
reason is / which counterpledyth faith in every point. And would ye then send
the^ twayn forth to scole to gether that can never agree to gether / but be
ready to fight to gether and either scratch out others eyes by the way? It
semyth also sumwhat strange / that when god has left us in his holy scripture
well and suffycyently his doctrine / whereby he would we should have warni^g of
all such thing as he would we should believe and go or leave undone / and has left
us the scripture for none other cause but for yt yt should stand unto us for the
wytnes of his will declared us by writing / yt we should not say nay but we were
warned / and no^e other cause why ye scripture should be given us but to tell us
his pleasure and styr us to fulfull it / we shall now not shape our faith after
ye scripture / but furst frame us a f^yth our self / and the^ shape the
scripture of god thereby / and make yt agree thereto. This were i^ deed a good
easy way for a slothful mason that were an evil work man to make him a
squire and a ruler of led / that when he list not to take ye lobour to he we
the stone to the squire he may bend the squire to the stone / and so shall he
yet bring them to geder at ye lest ways. As for the old co^mentours quod I
they tell you ye same tale that the text does / but they tell yt you more
plain as we shall more talk of after. But surly ye begyld me now in that ye
set reason so short. for verily I would never have went that ye would in
scripture like worse a wise man the^ an unreasonable reder. Nor I ca^ not se why
ye should reken reason for an enemy to faith / except ye reken every man for
your enemy that is your better and hurts you not. Thus were o^e of your.v.
wytys enemy to a another. And our feling should abhor our sight / because we
may se further by.iiii. mile the^ we may feel. How can reason (but if reason be
unreasonable) have more dysdayne to here ye troth of any point of faith / then
to se the proof of many things natural / whereof reason ca^ no more attayn to
the cause / then it can in the Article of the faith. But still for any power ye
reason has to perceive the cause / she shall judge it impossible after she
prove it true / but if she believe her eye better then her wytt. when ye se ye
adamant stone draw iren to it / it greueth not reason to look thereon / but
reason has a pleasure to behold the thing that passes her power to perceive.
For it is as plain against the rule of reason that an heavy body should move
alone any other mocyon then dounward / or that any bodily thing should draw a
another without touching / as is any article of the faith. Nor never was there
yet cause by reason assigned that me^ may perseyue for probable / but only that
it is a secret properte of the stone / which is as much to say as I wot nere
what. And yet as I say reason can byleue^ yt thing well enough / and be not
angry therwyth nor strive against yt. And yet all the rulys yt ever she lernyd
tell her still that it may not be / ^ ye quod he but a mannys own eyes tell him
yt yt may be. and that must nedys content him. May a man then better trust
his eyes quod I the^ his wit? ye mary q he / what may he better trust then his
eye^? His eyes may q I be deceyuyd and wene they se yt they se not if reso^
give over his hold / except ye thynk the iugler blow his gallys through the
goblettys bottom / or cut your gerdell before your face in.xx. pecys and make it
hole again / and put a knyfe into his eye and se never the worse / And turn a
plum into a dogs tord into a boys mouth. Now happened yt madly yt even with
this word came one of my folk and askede whethere they should make ready for
dinner. Abide quod I let us have better meat furste. And therwyth your friend
and I began to laugh. well quod I make none haste yet for a little while. And so
went he his way half owte of countenance / wenyng that he had done or said
sum what like a fool / as he was one yt was not very wise in deed and wont so
to do. And then said I to your friend. Now ye se that reason is not so proud a
dame as ye take her for. She sees done in deed by nature that she cannot
perseyue how / and is well contentyde therewyth. She sees a fond fellow
deceive her sight and her wytt therwt / and takyth yt well and meryly and is
not angry yt ye iougeler will not teache every man his craft. And wene ye the^
that she will take yt so hyely that god him self her master and maker should do
what him list / and than tell her what and tell her not how? I pray you quod I
that our lord was borne of a vyrgyn how know you? Mary q he by scripture. How
know you quod I that ye should believe ye scripture? Mary q he by faith. why q I
what does faith tell you therein? Faith quod he tellith me that holy scripture
is thyngys of troth written by the secret techyng of god. And whereby know you
quod I that ye should believe god? whereby q he? this is a strange questyon. Every
m^n q he may well wete that. That is troth quod I. But is there any horse or any
ass that wottyth that? None quod he that I wot of / but if Dalams ass any
thing understood thereof. For he spoke like a good reasonable ass. If no br^te
best can wytt that quod I / and every man may / what is the cause why that man
may and other bestys may not? Mary quod he for man has reso^ and al they have
none. A well the^ quod I reason must he nedys have then that shall parceyue
what he should believe. And so must reason not resy^^ faith but walk with her /
and as her handmayd so wayt upon her / that as contrary as ye take her / yet
of a troth faith goth never without her. But likewise as if a maid be suffered
to run on the bridle or be cup shoten or wax to proud / she will then wax
copious and chop logyk with her mastres / and fare sometime as she were fra^tyk
/ so if reason be suffered to ren out at riot and wax over hye hartyd and proud
/ she will not fail to fall in rebellyo^ toward her mastres faith. But on ye
other side if she be well brought up and well gydyd and kept i^ good temper /
she shall never disobey faith being in her right mi^de. And therefore let reso^
be well gyded / for surely faith goth never without her.

Now in the study of scripture / i^ deuysyng upon the sentence / in
consyderyng what ye read / in ponderyng ye purpose of diverse co^mentys / in
co^paryng to gether diverse textes that seem contrary and be not / albeyt I deny
not but that grace and goddys especyall help is the great thing theryn / yet
vsyth he for an instrument mannys reason thereto. God helpyth us to ete also /
but yet not without our mouth. Now as the hand is the more nymble by the use of
sum featys / and the leggys and fete more swyft and sure by the custum of going
and rennyng / and the hole body the more wyeldy and lusty by some kind of
excercyse / so is yt no doubt but that reason is by study / labor and
excercyse of Logyk / Philosophy and other lyberall arts corroborate and
quykkenyd / and the judgment both in them and also in orators / laws and
storys much rypyd. And albeyt poettys ben with many men taken but for payntyd
wordys / yett do they much help the judgment and make a man among other
thi^gis well furnyshed of one special thing / without which all lernyng is half
lame. what is that q he? Mary q I a good mother wytt. And therefore ar i^ mine
oppynyo^ these Lutheranys in a mad mind / yt would now have all learning save
scripture only clean cast aw^y. which thyngys (if the time will serve) be as
me thinks to be taken and had / and with reason brought as I said before into
the service of dyuynyte. And as holy seynte Iherom says / The Ebrues well
dyspoyle the Egipcyens / when crystys lernyd men take out of the pagame writers
the riches and lerning and wysdom that god gave unto them / and employe ye same
in the seruyse of diuynyte about the profit of goddys chosyn chyldern of
Israel the church of Christ / which he has of the hard stony paynims made the
chylderne of Abraham.

The.xxiiii. chapyter
The messenger make the obieccyons against the author / in that he counceyled
the student of scripture to bring thartycles of our faith with him for a
special rule to conster the scripture by. And ye author confyrmythe his
counsel given in that byhalfe / declarynge yt with out that rule / men may
sone fall in to great errors in ye study of holy scripture.

with this your friend held as he said him self somewhat co^tet that reason
was not so great an enmy to faith as she semyd. But yet he thought that he
should have need rather to be well brydelyd / tha^ to bear much rule in ye
interpretacyon of scripture. But as for ye the other point yt we should nedys
bring the faith with us all ready / as a rule to learn the scripture by / when
we come to the scripture to learn the faith by / that he thought in no wise
conuenyent / but a thing he said which like as if we would go make the cart to
draw the horse. well quod I we shall see anon whether the carte draw the
horse or the horse the carte. Or whether we be yet hapely so blind that we se
not well which is the carte. which is the horse. First quod I tell me how old
would ye ye one were ere he come to ye study of scripture. By my faith he. I
would have a christen mannys child begin therein very yo^g / and therein contynew
all his life. In good faith quod I yt like I not amys / so that ye do not mean
that ye would have him all his life learn nothing else: And yet that could I
suffer to and allow right well in some. But yet if he did never in his life
learn ought else / how old think ye that he should be or he learned the articles
of his belefe in ye bible? I can not redely tell quod he / for I have not seen
it assayed. well quod I since we be not sure how long it would be in learning
there / were it not best then yt for ye while he were tought his creed before
in his own mother tongue? I deme^ not y^ q he / yt he should conne his creed
before / because every chryste^ mannys child by the law should know his faith
as soon as he coud / but I say he should not therewith take upon him to judge
and examyne holy scripture thereby. well quod I let this christian child of ours
alone for a while. And let us consider if there were a good old ydolater that
never had hard in all his life any thing of our belefe or of other god the^
only the man in y^ moan / who^ he had watched and worshypped every frosty
night. If this man might suddenly have y^ hole bible turned into his own tongue
and read yt over / think ye that he should thereby learn all the artycles of y^
faith? I thynk quod he y^ he might. Think ye so q I? I put case yt he believed
yt all y^ book were lies? Mary q he that may he by y^ book him self lern ye
contrary. For the book in tellyng his tale affyrmyth his tale and techyth yt to
be true. ye say very trothe quod I if yt were all one to read a thing and learn
a thing. But now might there be an other book made also with less wonders and
fewer and thereby less vnlykly / and yett all untrue. And how should his mind
give him than that this book tellyng so incredible wonders should be true? Nay
quod he that thing must he nedys believe or else he can parceyue nothing. well
quod I then is there one point of faith one great lesson to be lernyd without
the book / that must be lernyd sum where either by god or man / or else y^ hole
book will do us little service. And of whom we shall lern that / we shall se
herafter. But now suppose that this old ydolater were thorouly perswadyd in
his mind yt all the book were true / thynk you tha^ that he should find out
theryn all the artycles of our faith? I thynk quod he that he should Thynk ye so
q I? beyt so than. But thynk ye that he shall find them out^ all in a weke?
Nay quod he yt can he not do. well quod I than since he shall not at the lest
wise find them out all on a day / let us leave him a little while in sekyng /
and we shall return again after to him and look what he shall have founden.
And in the mean season we shall go look again upon our good little godso^
the boy parde yt we crystened right now and taught him his creed and set him
to scripture. were it need y^ this child knew no more of his faith but his
creed before he go to scripture? Me thinks quod he that yt were enough. Be
it so than quod I.

whatt if yt should fortune him to find some text of scripture that should
seem to him to be contrary to his creed. As for ensample if he happened upon
the redyng of these wordys / Dij estis and filij excelsi omnes / Goddys be ye
all and the chyldern of the hye god. what if he would wene that sith in these
wordys it is said all good me^ be the chyldern of god / our savior Christ
were not goddys only begoten son / but his son in such wise as god by y^
prophet callyth all good men? That coud he not think q he. For he should in ^
other parts of scripture find many placys yt should show him well the contrary.

well said quod I and very truth. But now in the mean time will ye that he shall
believe as yt text shall seem to sound to him against his creed till he have
found a another text in scripture that answeryth yt and seemyth to him to say
more plainly ye contrary? Nay quod he not one hour. For he sees / yt though
other good men be called goddys chyldern and goddys / yet as they be not very
goddys / so be they not gods very natural chyldern by generacyon but by
acceptacyon / where as the creed says of our savior / that he is gods
only bygotten sone / that sygnyfyeth him to be his son by generacyon. That
is quod I very true and well and resonably consyderyd / and according unto the
very right faith. But now consider that ye make him by and by fall to the
squaryng of his stones like that slowthfull maso^ that ye spoke of with his
leden rule. For now ye make him to examyne the troth of this text of the
psalm by the article of the faith / which he brought with him / and by a
colleccio^ and discourse of reason. And so forthwyth ye find both these rules
necessary to the discussio^ of scripture. Of which twain ye would in the
byginnyng admit nether another. But now goo ferther. what if he would upon this
text / homines and iumenta sal uabis deus / God thou shall save both men and
bestys / wene that bestys had immortal soulis as men have / and that man and
best should be both saved at last / and so y^ no dedely sin should be
ponyshed with everlasting pain / ^^ll he came to other textys that should prove
well the contrary / were ye best or else were it better that bysyde his
creed he had knowledge before of these artycles of our feythe / that only our
souls be in mortal and not bestys al so / And that ye pain of hell shall be
for sinners ever lasti^g / And that he may thereby with reason joined thereto /
perceive that this text / Thou shalt save both men and bestes / is mente by
some other kind of saving and preseruyng here in this world / and not of
bryngyng both to heaven? All this may he know quod he by scripture self well I
^ough. That wot I well q I. And yet as plain as christ speaks of hell i^ the
gospel / Origene for all y^/which neither was a nawghty man nor unlearned in
scripture / could not so clerly se it but that he said the contrary. And took
the words of Christ in a wrong sense. And would perauenture with one that
would stykke only upon ye the wordys of scripture leuyng ye right sense
thereof / which god and his holly spryt has tawght his church / bring him to
a baye therein / that he should be feign not our child only / but also a well
elderly man and in scripture well forward / to take him in conclusyon to y^
faith of Chrystys church. Now if our child should read on the text of
scripture without care of the comme^ it is / and without enny further enstruccyon
of the poyntis of our faith than be specyfyd in our comme^ ^rede / made in the
begynyng as a brefe reme^brans by the appostellys / not setting out in so short
a thing and clearly declaring all that we be bounden to bileue / albeit yt he
should well find in scripture many plain and open textys wherbye ye godhed of
our savior and his egalyte with his father may well and suffycye^tly be prouyd /
yet were he not vnlykly by such other textys as seem to show him to be less
then his father / to fall into ye sect and heresy of ye Arryanys. And against
those other textys prouyng his egall godhed / to deuyse such false glosys as
they did / where as being before taught and confyrmed by the faith of y^ church
y^ our savior is one god and one egall substance with his father / shall well
perceive and understand thereby / yt all y^ textis yt seem to make him less /
be nothing to be understood of his godhed but of his manhod only. As when we
comenly speak of our self and of our own nature / and say we shall dye and
wormys ete us up and turn all to dust / we mean all this by our body only and
nothing entend thereby to deny the immortalyte of our soul. we may not dyne
to day if I should reken you the tenth part of such thyngys as we must nedys
upon loss of heuyn believe / which neither our child with his only creed /
and much less our old idolater without creed should so find out by scripture
/ but that they were both well lykely to take the scripture to the wrong part
/ except we take with us for a rule of interpretacyon the articles of our faith.

The.xxv. chapyter
The author taking occacyo^ upon certain words of the messe^ger / declares
y^ preeminence / nec^ssite / and profit of holy scripture / showing
nathelesse that many thyngys have been taught by god without writing. And many
great things so remain yet unwritten of trewthys necessary to be bileued.
And yt the new law of Christ is the law so written in the heart / that yt shall
never out of his church. And that the law there wryt^en by god / is a right
rule to interpret the wordis written in his holy / scripture. which rule with
reason and the old interpretours / the author shows to be ye very sure way
to wade with / in the great streme of holy scripture.

wHy than quod he this were as myche to say / as that god had not well written
his holy scripture / if he have caused yt to be written so / as men may be so
sone deceived therein / that they were as likely and (as it semyth by you) more
likely to fall in to a false wey tha^ find out y^ ^rew. And better were yt
tha^ that god hade not given us the scripture at all / than to give us a way to
walk / where in we were more lykely to synke than save our self. holy scripture
quod I / both is such as I have said / and yet nothing follows it theruppon
/ that god has not caused it to be written well / or that it had been better
to have kept it from us. And albe it yt in this point were a great occasyo^
of a long tale / in declaryng and making open y^ god has in yt writing of holy
scripture vsede so high wisdom and showed such a wonderful temperaunce / yt
the very strange famylyare fashyon the^ of / may to good me^ and wise well
declare / that as it was written by me^ / so was it indyted by god / yet
passi^g over the praise I will speak one word or twain for ye answer of such
blame as ye lay thereto. For it is almost a comen thing among men so to speak
su^tyme as though they coud amend the workis of god. And few men be there I
wene but they think yt if they had been of goddys council in the making of
the world / though they dare not be so bold to say yt they coud have made it
beter / yet if theye might have ruled yt / he should have made many thyngys
of a another fassion. And for all yt if he would yet call us all to council /
and change nothing till we were upon every thing all agreed / ye world were
well likly till domys day to go forth on as yt goth all ready / saui^g y^ I wot
nere whether we would all agree to be wynged. But as for ye scripture shortly
god has so devised it / that he has geuyn the world therein a^ inestimable
tresure as the case stands. And yet we should happily nothing have neded
thereof if y^ wounds of our own folly had not of our great necessyte and
goddys great goodness required it. For at our creacion he gave but ^wo
precepts or three by his own holy mouth to our first parentys. And as for all
yt was for them to do bysyde / the reason which he had planted i^ their
souls gave them suffycient warning / whereof y^ hole some stood in effect /
in the honor of god and goddys frendys / with love of each to the other and
to their ofspryng and lineage. But the preceptis y^ he gave by mouth was three.
Twain co^mau^di^g generation and etynge / y^ third forbedyng the tree of
knowledge. And yt was for them contynuall / where the the other twayn albe it they
were thereto bounde^ by the precepte / yet were not they and their posteryte
bounden thereto at all owers and all placis. But need was it in the beginning to
give them kowlege thereof / for as mich as they had no hunger to warn them of
ye tone / nor sensual rebellyouse appetite to warn them of the the other. But
after yt they were by god onis admonished thereof / tha^ did reason enterprete
ye re^naunt / whereby they wyste yt they should ete for conseruacyon of their
bodies / and in gender for propagacio^ of their kind. An^ sith they perceived
that these.ii. thi^gys was the^d and e^tent of those commandments / they
thereby consequently knew when it was time and place and occacyo^ convenient to
fullfyll them. But when they had onys at ye subtell swasyon of the devil /
broken the third commandment in tasting y^ forbede^ fruit / being than
expelled out of paradise / than concerning their food and engenderinge / not
only reason often shew^d them what was honest and profitable / but also
se^sualyte what was bestely and plesaunte / which sensualyte labored so bysyly
to cause man to set by delight above good and conueniente / yt for the
resystence thereof it then bycam to be the spyrytuall bysynesse and occupacion
of man / so to preserve and bring up the body / yt it were not suffered to
master y^ soul / and so to rule and bridell sensualyte / y^ it were subject
and obedyent unto reason / as god wylled the woman to be subject and
obedyencer of man. wherein god would yt we were learned rather to suffer our
se^suall pertys plain and morn / tha^ to follow their own hurt and owers to.
As it hade been better for our father Adame and us all / that he had suffered
his wyffe our mother Eve / to be sad and angry both and like a woman to weep
to / than to have eten thapple for f^leshype to please her with all. Now did
all the syn anon spring up for the more part upon y^ occacyon of fedyng and
e^genderynge. whereof spronge couytouse / glotenye / ^louth / wroth / and
lechery. And many times pride and e^uye as one / perceyuyng him self in these
thyngys in better co^dycyo^ or worse tha^ a another / so bygan to co^ceyue a
setting by him self / wt-to^ tempte of other or e^uye and hatered to some
other (saving ye pride sometime also sprang out of the soul) and so liked it
self yt it e^uyed the better as Cayme did Abell / and for to be the more set
by / pride lo^ged superfluously to get by cou^tyse and gredynes many folkys
lyuy^gys in his own hands / to make other fol^ys serve him and honor and
ha^ge upon him for necessite. And of all these myschie^fes was always
se^sualyte ready to mynyster matter / and by all the dorys and windous of the
body by feeling / tasti^g / smelli^g / sight and heeryng / ceased never to
se^de in occasyo^s to y^ soul / nor ye devil never ceacyd for hys^ part
dylyge^tly to put forward. Against who^ did reason resist / with good
counsel geuyn to ye soul / and good sprites appointed by god / gave their
help also / and god assysted with his aid and grace where he found the
person willing to work therwyth. And i^ this manner continued man long time /
not with out reuelacyo^ of Christ onys to cu^. which faith delivered to
the father / went by mouth to the son / And so from child to child herd
and byleued among them. And what so were god dys pleasure bysyde / that nature
and r^ason could not plainly show them / god of his goodness by special mesage
gave them undoubted knowledge as he did to Noe / Loath and Abraham / and diverse
other / whereof some be synnys written and comprised i^ scripture / and of
lykelyhed not all. For well probable is it that ye patryarkys in diverse
things that they did / as in their diverse maryagys and sum such other
thyngys as than were by them well done for the time / were to them appointed
specially by god for causys well knowene to him self and unknown to us / and
ye thyngis now forbeden us and therefore to us unlawful / except goddys like
ordinance or dispensacyon should herafter in general or pertyculer be reveled
to the contrary. But so was yt after that the world waxynge worse / right good
and virtuous linagys declynid and decayed. And by the the lewd co^uersacyon
of evil people fell by dysorder in such a blyndnes / y^ albe it some were
there always that perceived well their duty / yet were ye common people of y^
chyldern of Israel by custom of syn so darked in their natural knowledge /
that they lacked in many thingis the right perceyuyng / that reason (had it not
been by evil custo^e corrupted) might verily well have showed them. For ye
remedy whereof god of his endless mercy / by the law written with his own
fi^ger unto Moses i^ ye tables of stone / by the.x. co^maundementys / put in
reme^beraunce again certain co^clusyons of the law of nature / which their
reason (overwhelmed with sensualytye) had than forgotten. And to the end that
they should keep his bihestes ye better / he gave them a great hepe of the
laws and cerymoneys moo / to keep them in strayte for strayynge abroad in
riot. And wroughte great wonders that theye should well se that those thyngys
were his own deed / whereby they might have ye more dread to transgress them.
And there in writing he gave a warnyng also of christ / that god would onys send
them, spryngyng of themself / to whom they should give herynge instead of
Moses. Of who^ also as well before as after by Patryarkes and prophetys / by
fygures and prophesyes / god ceaced not i^ such wise to foreshew his cummyng /
his cause / his living / his deyng / his resurreccyon and his holy actys / that
if pride and envy had not lettyd it / the fygurys and prophysyes set and
comparyd with his cummyng / conuersacyon and doyngys / might well have made
all the Jews to know him. And for the parceyuyng and good understanding of the
law written / he sent always sum good men / whose wordys / well living / and
sumtyme also manyfeste miracles showed therwyth / never left them destytute of
suffycyent knolege that lo^gyd to lern the law. Not to plete it and for glory
to dyspute itt / but to teache ytt again mekely. And as mannys fraylte could
suffer it / specially to fulfill and keep it. yet after all this when the world
was in a more decay and ruin of all vertew / than ca^ our savior Christ to
redeem us with his death / and leave us his new law / whereof was long before
prophesied by the prophet Hyeromy. Lo the days be coming says our lord / wha^
I shall order and dyspose to the house of Israel and ye house of Judah / a new
covenant or testament. I shall give my law in their myndys. And I shall write
yt in their heart. and I wylbe their lord and they shall be my people. This law
wryte^ in me^nys hartys / was according to ye wordys of the prophet fu^st
brought by our savior to ye house of Israel and ye house of Judah to who^ as
him self says he was specially sent. I am not sent says our lord but unto ye
sheep yt are peryshyd of the house of Israel. And also he said it is not good
to take ye bread fro ye board of ye chyldern and cast yt to dogs. But yet not
only the ready towardnes of sum other caus^d the^ to be partetakers of ye bread
/ but also sone after ye stubbernes and obstynate infydelyte of ye jews /
caused saint poule and thappostels to say unto their face / The gospel of
Crist was ordenyd by god to be furst preached unto you / But sith yt ye refuse
yt / Lo we depart from you to the gentylys. And so was in their stead the
church gathered of all the world abroad. All which not wythstandyng both were
there at that time out of ye Jews co^uertyd and made many a good christian man /
and many of ye same people turnyd unto Christ syns / and in conclusyo^ the time
shall cu^ / when ye remnau^t yt shall be than left / shall save them self by
the same faith. This is called the law of Crystis faith / the law of his holy
gospel. I mean not only the wordys written in the bokys of his euangelistys /
but much more specially ye substance of our faith yt self / which our lord
said he would write in mennys hartys / not only because of the secret
operacyon of god and his holy spyryte / in iustyfye^g the good cryste^ either by
the worki^g with ma^nys good will / to the perfeccyon of faith in his soul /
or with the good intent of the offerers to the secret infusyon of that vertew
into the soul of an innocent infant / but also for yt he furst without writing
reveled those heavenly mysteryes by his blessed mouth through the erys of his
apostels and dyscyples i^ to their holy hartys. And by them in like manner /
furst wythowt writing by only wordys and prechyng so spredde yt abroad in the
world / that his faith was by the mouthys of his holy messengers put into
me^nys erys / and by his holy hand written in mennys hartys or ever any word
thereof almost was written in the book. And so was it conuenye^t for the law
of life / rather to be written in the lively myndys off men / than in the deed
skynnys of bestys. And I nothing dowt but all had ytt so been / that never
gospel had been written / yet should the substance of this faith never have
fallen out of christen folkys hartys / but the same spyryte that plantyde yt /
the same should have wateryd it / the same should have kept yt / the same
should have increased yt. But so has yt lyked our lord after his hye
wisdom to provide that some of his dyscyples have written many thingys of his
holy life / doctrine and faith / and yet far from all / which (as saint John
says) the world could not have comprehen hyd. These bokis ar tempryd by the
secret counsel of the holy ghost so plain and simple / that every man may find
in them that he may parceyue^ And yet so high again and so hard that no man
is there so connyng but he may find in them thyngys far above his reche /
far to profound to perce unto. Now were to ye christian people the poyntys of
Crystes faith (with which poyntys our lord would have them chargyd) known as I
say and plantyd before / and by reason thereof they far the beter understood
those books. And all though there might happily be some textys / which were not
yet of necessyte for the^ to parceyue / yet by the points of their faith were
they warnyd / that no text might there be constrewyd contrary to their faith.
And none Eua^gelyst was there nor none Appostle / that by writing ever sent the
faith to any nacyon / but if they were furst enformyd by word / and that god
had begone his church in y^ place. And for my part I would little dout / but
that the euangelystys and appostels both / of many great and secret mysteryes
spoke much more openly and much more plainly by mouth among the people than
ever they put yt i^ writing / for as much as their wrytyngys were lykly enough
at that time / to come into the handys of paganys and paynyms / such hoggys and
dogs as were not metely to have those precious perlys put upon their nose /
nor that holy food to be dashyd in their teeth. For which cause saint Peter
in his furste sermon unto the Jews / abstaynyd f^o^ the declaracyon of Crystis
godhed and egalytee with his father / as our savior him self (when the Jews
yt were unworthy to here yt / were offe^dyd with that he told them plainly yt
he was the son of god) wythdrewe ye doctrine from them again / and coueryd yt
with the verse of ye prophet / I have said ye be goddys and sonnys of the hye
god all / as though he wol^e say / what greuyth it you that name in me / which
name god by yt prophet has given to all good men. In which demeanure he denied
not the troth yt he had said of him self / but he blyndyd their wylfully
wynkyng eyes / i^ hydyng and puttyng up again the jewel yt he began to bring
forth and show the^^ the bright luster whero^ their bleryd eyes might not
endure to be^old. And what marvel though thappostels thus did in their speech
before infydels / or writing yt might cu^ into pagans ha^dys / when it apperyth
upon the epystels of saint Pou^e that among the christian flok where he taught
the^ by mouth / he told the^ not all ye trothys at one tale / Not only for yt
yt were to long / but also for yt in the beginning they coud not happily well
abyden yt. And therefore as Christ said to his dyscyples / I have more to say to
you / but ye be not able to bear yt yet / which onys apperyd what time y^
upon ye dysclosyng of the great mystery of the holy sacrament the holy flesh
of his body / y^ herers said who can abide this hard word / and therwt went
almost all their way / so did saint Poule I say by the Corynthians not teache
the^ all at onys. And therefore he says in his epistle to them / I have given
you hitherto but mylk and not strong mete. And wisdom speak we (says he)
among folk y^ be par^yt. Nor I mean not this yt there were any poyntis of the
substance of y^ faith which he showed to ye clargy yt he kept from the lay
people / or showed unto one man yt he kept from a another / but y^ to no man
lightly he showed all at onys. But because sum ca^ from the Jews and sum ca^
of y^ gentylys / therefore as they were so were they ha^delyd / not only by
grace but also by wisdom. and not only in the poyntys of ye faith / but also
in ye rytys and ^eremonyes / either of the church or of Moses law. whereof
some cer^monyes were forthwyth abolyshed / some not by and by / and some taken
i^ to the church of Christ and obseruyd still. But in conclusyo^ when they were
mete therefore / they were all taught / all that god would have them bounden to
believe. And than dout I nothing / but ye many thyngis that now be very dark in
holy scripture / were by thappostels (to who^ our lord opened their wyttys y^
they might understand scripture) so plainly declared / yt they were by the
people well and clearly understood. I say not all the hole scripture / in
which it may be that many a secret mystery lies yet coueryd concerning the
coming of Antecryste / and ye day manner and fassyon of the fynall judgment.
which shall never be fully disclosed / till the tymys appoyntyd by goddys hye
prouydence mete and convenient for them. And from time to time as yt lykyth his
majesty to have thyngys known or done in his church / so is yt no dout but he
temperyth his reuelacyo^s and in such wise does insumate and inspyre them into
the brestys of his christian people / that by the secret instynct of the holy
ghost / they consent and agree to gether i^ one / except heretykys that rebel
and refuse to be obedyent to god and his chirch^ who be thereby cut of from ye
lively tree of that vine / and waxing withered branches / be kept but for the
fire furst here and after in hell / except they repent and call for grace that
may graft them into the stok again. But as it may be that many thyngys be
there not all at onys reuelyd and understood in y^ scripture / but by so^dry
tymys and agys mo things and mo by god unto his church disclosed / and that as
yt shall like his high goodness and wisdom to dyspence and dyspose / so in
thyngys to be done may fall in his church varyete mutacyon and change / so am
I very sure that the holy ghost that god sent into his church / and Christ him
self that has promisyd unto the end of the world to persevere and abide in his
church / shall never suffer his catholyk church neither to agree to the making
of any law that shall be to god dampnably dysplesau^t / nor of any truth that
god would were beluyd to determyne or believe the contrary. For than had Christ
which is all truth / broken his promise / and (which were blasphemy and
abhomynable to thynk) were waxe^ untrue. And therefore over this as it may be
that as I said before some thyngys in holy scripture be not yet fully parceyuyd
and vnderstande^ / so am I very su^e that the church neither does nor can do
da^pnably conster, yt wrong. which yt should if they should conster yt so as yt
should make an article of mysbelyefe and of a false erronyous faith. As if they
should by mysseconstruccyo^ of the scripture bring up and believe / that Christ
were one god and egall with his father and with ye holy ghost / if ye troth
were otherwise in deed. And therefore sith the church in which Christ is
assystente and his holy spyryte / cannot to gods displeasure and their
dampnacyo^ fall in any false belief in any such substauncyall point of the
faith / yt must nedys be th^rfore / that Arrius and all other heretykes be
drowned in dampnable errors. The contrary oppynyo^ of whose execrable heresies
/ the church was in ye beginning taught by the mouth of Christ him self. And
after of his blissed appostels / which read and declared the scrypturs among
ye people in their time / showing them in what wise ye wordis of holy scripture
prouyd the troth of such artycles of ye faith as they taught them by mouth.
And how such textys as semyd the contrary were not contrary in deed. And
therwyth declared the^ of those textys ye right understanding. And albeyt yt
our savior showed and plainly prouyd yt in the scripture was given good tokens
and suffycyent knowledge of him / yet to thentent we should well know that his
own word and ordinance nedyth none othere authoryte but him self / but is to
be believed and obeyed be it written or not written / sum thyngys did he therefore
bid to be do^ / and su^ thyngys also to be believed / whereof we have in holy
scripture no wryti^g in the world. Saint Poule co^maundyth the people of
Thessalonica in his epistle to keep the tradycyons that he t^ke them either by
his writing or by his bare word. For ye wordis yt he said among them / our
lord had told them him for them. And therefore he writes unto the Corynthyes /
that of the holy howsell the sacrament of the auter he had showed them the
matter and ye manner by mouth / as our lord had him self taught yt to hi^. And
therefore no dout is there / but that by thappostels was the church more fully
taught of ye matter / than ever was written in all the scripture. There was
lernid the manner and form of consecracyon. There was lernyd much of the
mystycall gesturys and ceremonies vsyd in the mass. And if any man dout thereof
/ let him consider where should we else have the begynnig of the water put with
the wine into ye chalyce. For well we wot yt ye scripture byddyth yt not. And
every wise man may well wit tha^ when the gospel spekyth only of wy^e / there
durst no man in this world have been so bold to ^ut any thing else thereto. For
when ye gospel spekyth of wine only tornyd into his precious blood / what man
would adventure to make any myxture of water? And now is ye church so well
acertenid of goddys pleasure theryn wtoute any scripture / yt they not only
dare put in water / but also dare not leave yt out. And whereby knew ye church
this thing but by god and his holy appostels which taught in their time? And so
went yt forth from age to age / continued in ye church until this day / begone
by god i^ the beginning without any mencyon made i^ holy scripture. How beit
Luther says because yt is not co^mau^dyd by scripture / we may chese
therefore whether we will do yt or leave yt. For this one point is ye very fo^d
fou^dacio^ and ground of all his great heresies / yt a man is not bou^de^ to
believe any thing but if yt may be prouyd evidently by scripture. And theruppo^
goth he so farforth yt no scripture ca^ be evident to prove any ^hyng yt he
list to deny. For ^e will not agree it for euyde^t be it never so plain. And he
will call evident for him yt text / yt is euyde^t against hi^. And su^time if
it be to plain against him / tha^ will he call it no scripture / as he playth
with ye pystle of saint Iamys. And because the old holy doctors be full and hole
against him / he settyth the^ all at naught. And with these worshipful wise
ways he proclamyth hi^ self a co^querour / where besides all ye re^nau^t /
wherein every child may se his proud fra^tyk folly he is sha^fully put to flight
in ye furst point / yt had at ye furst face sum vysage of probabylyte. How be
it to say the truth / he were a lewd lorell that would nothing do that his
master would bid him / nor no thing believe but that his master would tell him /
but if he take yt him in writing / as Luther playth with Christ. Of whose
wordys or actys he will believe nothing / except he find yt in scripture / and
that plain and evident. Now must he by that meanys condemn the church of
Christ / for that they sayntyfy not the saturday which was the sabbaothe day
instytute by god among the Jews / co^maundyng the sabbat day to be kept
holy. And albeyt the matter of ye precepte is moral and the day legal so yt
yt may be changed / yet will there I ween no man think / that ever the church
would take upon the^ to change yt without special ordinance of god. whereof
we find no remembrance at all in holy scripture. By what scripture is
euyde^tly known yt every man and woman has power to mynyster the sacrament of
baptysme? Let yt be showed / either co^maundment / council / license or
example expressyd in scripture. Many thyngys ar there like / which as holy
doctors agree / were taught thappostels by Christ / and the church by
thappostels / and so comen down to our days by co^tynuall successyo^ fro
theyrs. But I will let all other pass over and speak but of one. Every good
christian man I dout not beleuyth that our blessed Lady was a perpetual vyrgyn
as well after the birth of Christ as before. For yt were a strange thing yt
she should after that blessed birth be less myndid to clennes and puryte / and
set less by her holy purpose and promise of chastyte vowed and dedycate unto
god / the^ she did before. For suerly who so consyderyth ye wordys of the
gospel in saint Luke / shall well perceive that she had vowyd vyrginite. For
when ye angel had said unto her / Lo thou shall co^ceyue in thy womb and
bring forth a child / and thou shall call his name Jesus / she answered him /
how may this be? for as for man I know none. which though yt be spoken but for
the time than present / yett must yt nedys sygnyfy that she never would know
none after the manner of speaking. By which a nun might say / as for man
there medelyth none with me. sygnyfieng that never there shall. And in commen
speech is that figure much in use. By which a woman says of one whom she is
determynyd never to mary / we may well talk to gether but we wed not to
gether / meaning yt they never shall wed to gether. And in such wise meant our
lady when she said / how may this be for I know no man / meaning that she never
would meddle with man. Or else had her answer no thing been to purpose. For the
angel said not / Lo thou art co^ceyuyd. which if he had said / she might
well have maruelyd only for yt she knew no man all ready. But when he said thou
shalt co^ceyue / this coud be no marvel unto her for that she knew no man all
ready. And therefore sith she maruaylyd how it might be yt ever she should
co^ceyue and have a child / it must nedys be yt her answer me^t yt she never
would meddle with man. And therefore she maruelyd because he said it should be and
she knew not how it could be / but yt ways by which she was at full poi^t with
her self yt it should never be. so yt the^ he showed her how it should cu^ about
by ye holy ghost cu^myng into her / and ye power of god on high shadoyng her.
and the^ she asse^tyd and said / Lo here ye handmayd of god / be yt done to me
after thy word as thou tellyst me. And thus appears yt euydently yt she had
than a full determinyd purpose of vyrgynyte. And that as it semith such as she
thought not lawful to change.. For else wha^ ye angel did ye message / she
might have inclined thereto though she had before been in a another mind. Now
when she had then so full and fast a purpose of perpetual vyrginite before
the birthe of her blessed child / which came among his other heuinly doctrine
to call and exorte the world from all pleasure of ye flesh to ye purytye and
clennes of the body and soul / and from ye desire of carnal generacyo^ to a
gostly regeneracion in grace / more^ were it then wonder if she shul^ have the^
more regard of fleshely delight / or cure of wordly procreacyon than ever she
had before her celestyall concepcyon of her maker made man in her blessed womb?
Or what man coud thynk yt that ever god would suffer any erthly man after / to
be conceyuyd in that holy closet taken up and consecrate so specially to god?
This reverent article of our ladys perpetual vyrgynyte / the church of Christ
being taught the truth by Christ / perpetually has believed syns the time of
Christ. And yet is there no word thereof in Crystys gospel written / but rather
diverse textys so sownning to the contrary / that by the wrong vnderstangyng of
them / the heretyke Eluydyus took the occasyon of his herysy / by which he would
that our lady after the birth of Christ had other chyldern by Joseph. How can
we than say that we could without the learning of the faith before / find out
all the poyntys in the scripture / when there be su^ that all crystendome
believe / and believe them self bounden to believe / whereof ye scripture gives no
plain doctrine but rather semyth to say the contrary. But as I began to say /
the holy appostels being taught by their great master Christ / did reche unto
ye church as well the artycles of the faith / as the vnd^rstandyng of such
textys of scripture as was meet and convenient for the matter. whereby it is
not vnlykly yt the gospel of saint John / and the epistels of saint Poule /
were than beter understood among the comen people / tha^ they be paraduenture
now with some that take them self for great clerkys. And as thappostels at yt
time taught the people / so did ever some of them yt hard the^ tech forth and
leave their doctrine and tradycyons to other that ca^ after. By reso^ whereof
not only came the rytys and sacramentys and the artycles of our faith from hand
to hand / from Christ and his appostels unto our days / but also the great
part of the right understanding of holy scripture by good and godly writers
of sundry tymys. By whose good and wholesome doctrine set forth by their
vertew with goddys good inspyracyon grace and h^lp of the holy ghost / we have
also the knowledge and parceyuynge what was ye faith of Crystys church in every
time syns. And thereby parceyue we yt these hereti^ys be not only barkers
against ye faith that now is / but also that has been ever synnys Christ dyed.
And therefore is holy scripture as I said ye highest and the best learning that
any man can have / if one take the right way in the learning. It is (as a good
holy saint says) so maruelously temperyd / that a mouse may wade therein /
and an olyphaunt be drownyd therein. For there is no man so low / but if he will
seek his way with the staff of his faith in his hand / and hold that fast
and search the way therwyth / and have the old holy fathers also for his gidis
/ going o^ with a good purpose and a lowly heart / vsyng reason and refusinge
no good lerninge / with calling of god for wisdom grace and help that he may
well keep his way and follow his good gidys / tha^ shall he never fall in
parell / but well and suerly wade through and cum to such end of his journey as
him self would well wyshe. But suerly if he be as long as Longius / and have an
hye heart and trust upon his one wytt (as he does look he never so louly /
that settethe all the old holy fathers at naught) that fellow shall not
fail to synk over the eris and droune. And of all wreches warst shall he walk
/ yt forci^g little of the faith of Christ's church / cu^meth to the scripture
of god to look and try therein whyther the church by leave a right or not. For
either douteth he whyther Christ teache his church true / or else whyther
Christ techeth it at all or not. And tha^ he doutith whither Christ i^ his
wordis did say true / when he said he would be with his church till the end
of the world. And surely the thing yt made Arrius Pelagius / Faustus /
Manicheus / Donatus / Eluidius and all ye table of the old herytikes to drown
them self in those da^pnable herysyes / was nothing but high pride of their
learning in scripture / wherein they followed there own wyttys and left the
common faith of the catholyke church / preferrynge their own gay glosys
before the right catholyke faith of all Christis chirch / which ca^ never err
in any substa^ciall point that god would have us bounde^ to believe. And
therefore to end where we bygan / who so will not unto the study of scripture
take the points of ye catholyque faith as a rule of interpretacyon / but of
dyffydens and mystruste study to seek in scripture whyther the faith of the
church be true or not / he ca^ not fail to fall in worse errors and far more
ieoperdous than any man can do by philosophy / whereof the reasons and
argumentys in matters of our faith have nothing the like authorytye.

The.xxvi. chapyter
The messenger saying that him seemed he should not believe ye church if he saw
the church say one thing and holy scripture a another thing because the
scripture is the word of god / the author she with yt the faith of the church
is the word of god as well as the scripture / and therefore as well to be
believed. And yt the faith and the scripture well vnde^sta^den be never
contrary. And farther she with yt upon all doutys rysynge upon holy scripture
concerning any necessary article of the faith / he that cannot upon all that
he ca^ here in the matter o^ both the sydys parceyue ye beter and trewer part /
has a sure and vndoutable refuge prouydyd him by the goodness of god to bring
him out of all perplexyte / in that god has co^maundyd him in all such doutys
to believe his church.

TRuly sir q he me thinks it is well said that ye have said. And in good
faith to say the truth I se not what I should answer yt wythall. And yet when
I look bak again upon holy scripture / and consider that yt is goddys own
wordys which I wot well ye will grant / I find it hard i^ mine har^ to
believe all the me^ in the hole world / if they would say any thing whereof I
should se that the hol^ scripture says ye contrary / sithe yt is reason that I
believe god alone far better than the^ all. In that quod I ye say very truth.
But now I putt case that god would tell you.ii. thyngys whether of them would
ye believe best. Nether another q he / but I would believe them both firmly and
both a like. what if neither another quod I were lykely to be true but semede
both twain impossyble. That should quod he make little force to me. For that
onis known that god tells them / seemed they never so far unlikely nor never
so far impossible / I neither should nor could have any dout but that they were
both twain true. That is well said q I. But now and yt so were that those.ii.
thyngis seemed the tone to the the other clean contrary / what would ye than thynk
and which would ye tha^ believe? yet could I not quod he dout any thing but that
they were very true both / but I would verily think that I did not well under
stand the tone of them. what would ye than do quod I if he bad you bileue
them both. Mary q he than would I pray him tell me furste how he
understands them both. For though I bileue that they be both true in that
sense and purpose that he takythe his own words / and may in that manner
understood / well stand and agree to gether / yet can I not believe them
both in that sense and understanding wherein they repugne and be directely
contrary each to other. That is quod I so well said yt in my mind no man ca^
amend yt. But now would I wytt quod I whyther that the faith of the church be
the word of god / and by god spoken to the church or not. yes q he god
speaks to his church in ye scripture. And is nothing gods words. q I but
scripture? The wordys yt god spoke to Moses were theye not goddys wordys all
till they were written? And the wordys of Christ to his aposteles were they
not his wordys till they were written? yes than quod he. But now sithe he has
perfyted and finished the corpus of holy scripture / all thing that he would
chryste^ people should believe / and all that he would the church would do / and
all that he would the church should eschew / all this has he left them his
mind suffycyently in holy scripture. And none other wise quod I bysyde? I had
wentt we had been at a another point / in that ye se ye sabbat day changed in
to so^day without any word of scripture / geuyng any commandment of ye
change in the new testement / from the co^mau^demente geuyn for the saturday
in the old. And also for the point that we spoke of / towchinge the
perpetual virginite of our lady whereof is no word written in scripture. But
sith I perceive that the great affeccyo^ and reverence that ye bear to the
scripture of god / not without great cause but without any mesure / makethe you
in the case that ye take all authoryte and credence from every word of god
spoken beside the scripture / I would ask you therefore this questyon. If god in
holy scripture tell you.ii. things that seem the tone contrary to the to^here
/ as for ensample if he tell you in one place y^ he is less than his father /
and in a no there place that he and his father be all one / which of these will
you believe?

Mary quod he both twayn. for they may stand to gether well enough. For he was
less as man / and was all one and egall as god. Uery troth yt is quod I that
ye say. But now if ye had been born in ye days of Arrius the heretyke / he
would not have receyuyd nor hold him self content with this answer / but he
would have agreed you the furst part and put you ferther to prove the secunde
part. And unto that t^^te he would have made you a gloss that his father and
he were one not in substance but in will. And that gloss he would have
fortyfyed and made su^what semely with a another word of Christ i^ which he
prayed his father sayyng / as thou and and I be both one so make thou that
they and we may be made one / meni^g by his christen peole which shall never
be one with him in substance. So yt for the inequality of Christ by reason of
his ma^hed / ye must agree with him. But for unity of godhed / he will not agree
with him but putt you always to prove it. well quod he and thoghe he so did yet
if I were prouydid there fore / therbe textis ynowe that plainly prove yt. That
is quod I very truth But yet is there none but he shall always set you a another
against yt / and a gloss as fast for yours as ye shall have an answer for
his / in such wise as he may abuse a right wise and well lernyd man as he did
i^ his own days and many days after many a thousand. Than if yt so were that
in that dyspycyons ye could not make your audyence to dyscerne the truth /
nor peradventure persuade them to believe the truth / because the false part
might hap to have to the myndys of many a more face of truth / as it had at
that time to many that than were of that sect / what way would ye wind out?
Mary quod he I would believe well my self the trewthe and go to god / and let
them that would believe the false part go to the devil / ye should q I have
takyn therein a good sure way. But now if ye had been in that time (albe yt ye
be now fast and sure in the trewthe) ye might have happed while the matter was
in questyone / and many great clarkys and well scryptured men / and some
semyng right holy / set on the wrong side / ye might have happed I say so to
have been moved wi^h the reasons on both the sides / that ye should not have
wyste on which part to determyne your believe. And what would ye than have
done? Quod he ye put me now to a pynch / and I shall ans^ere you as I have
hard say that doctor Mayo sumtyme almoigner to king henry y^ seuynth answered
onys the king at his table. It happed that there was fallen in co^municacio^ y^
story of Joseph how his masters Putiphers wife a great man with y^ king of Egypt
/ would have pullid him to bed / and he fled away. Now master Mayo ( q ye kings
grace) ye be a tall strong man on the tone side / and a cunning doctor on ye
the other side / what would ye have done if ye had been not Iosephe but in Iosephes
stead? By my truth sir q he and yt like your grace / I can not tell you what
I would have don but I can tell you well what I should have don.

By my truth quod the king that was very well answerid. And since that
answer served him well there / I shall make ye same serve me here. For surely
if I had been in Arrius days i^ ye point that ye speak of / what I would have
do^ that wot I nere. But what I should have done that can I well tell you and
surely trust I would have done so too. what is yt quod I. Mary I would have
byleued the best quod he. The best quod I? that were best in deed if ye wist
which yt were. But the case is put / that the reasons grounded upon scripture
semyd unto you in such wise each to impugn and answer other / yt ye stood in
such a dout / that ye coud in no wy^e dyscerne whythere side said best. By god
quod he I had forgote^ that. well than were it best quod he / and so would I
have done I think / knele me down and make my special prayour to god yt yt
might please his goodness i^ so great a parell not to leave me perplexed / but
vouchesafe to enclyne mine assent unto that side yt he knew were true / and
would I should believe to be true. And then would I boldly believe the tone which
god should have put in my mind. Had not this been ye best way? If yt were not
quod I the best / yt might paraduenture serve for a second. A secunde quod he
tha^ ye take yt for naught. Nay quod I / there be two secondys after two manner
countyngys. One next unto y^ worst / a another next unto ye best. And your
way is surely far fro y^ worste. But yet dare I not assent that yt were the
best till I understand yt better. And therefore I pray you tell me this. If
after your special prayours made / ye wrote the tone part in one paper and
the the other part i^ a another and laid them both on the ground / and then
set up a^ staff between them both / would ye be then indefferent to take y^
tone side or y^ the other after / as yt should hap your staff to fall? why not
quod he. Or else put yt upon two lottys / and than at adventure draw the tone
and take yt. For when I have done as much as mine own wit will serve / and
have hard thereto all that I can of other me^ / and yet by neither can perceive
the better opinion / what should I do or what could I do ferther tha^ pray for
grace to gide my choice / and so at adventure bol^dly take ye tone and hold it
fast / dowtyng nothing but god assysted my choice / if I have a ferm faith in
his promise by which he promyseth that if we as^ we shall have askyng as saint
Iamys says without any dowte. And why should not I in such perplexed case
after help callid for of god / take the tone part at adventure by lot as did
thappostels in the chesyng of a new / to fulfill y^ place of y^ tratour Judas?
Lottys quod I be well lawful i^ the choice of such two things as be both so
good yt we be lykly to chose well enough why there so ever we take. But now if
ye were in the case that I have hard my father meryly say every man is at the
choice of his wife / that ye should put your hand in to a blind bagg full of
snakys and elys to gether.vii. snakis for o^e ele / ye would I wene reke^ it a
perilous choice to take up one at adventure though ye had made your special
prayour to speed well. Nor ye ought not in such case to adventure it upon
your prayour and trust of god without necessytye. That is peradventure troth
quod he. But in our case there is necessytye. For there were none othere way to
avoid the perplexity / but even take the tone by prayour and ferm trust in
god / which never deceived them yt trust in him. If there were quod I none
other way sumwhat were it than yt ye say. But now consider your case again.
And when yt so were that ye could not upon that ye hard the Arryanys and the
catholyke part argue to gether / parceyue whyther part were the better / and
therefore of those two talys told you by god in many textis of holy scripture /
some semynge plainly to say that Christ was not egall with his father / some
semynge as plainly to say the contrary / ye coud in no wise find any reason /
whereby ye could find your self moved to take the tone part for more
probable than y^ the other. I put case than that god would him self say to you I
have showed the truth of this matter to such a man / and how my scripture is
to be vnderstande^ concerning the same. Go thy ways therefore to him. And that
thing yt he shall tell the that thing believe thou. would ye say nay good lord
I will ask no man but thy self / and therefore tell me thine own mouth / or
else I will take the tone part at all adventures / and think that thou would
have yt so / or else would ye think yt god were your good lord and had done
myche for you in that it lykyde him so graciously for your surete to bring you
out of such a great perplexitye / whereby ye should for your own mind have
remained in an insoluble dowte i^ a matter of the faith / wherei^ it is damnable
to dwell in dowte or (which yet myche worse were) have declyned peradventure
in to an inuyncyble error? Ueryly q he great cause should I have had lightly
to thank god. ye would not than quod I first make your prayour and than with
good hope that grace shall guide your fortune take y^ tone part at aue^ture by
lot / but ye would in your prayour thank god for that prouysio^. And the^ would
ye get you to that man as fast as ye could. Uery truth quod he. Than if yt
man should tell you that Arryus and his cu^pany were herytyques all and took
textis of scripture wrong ye would bileue him? ye verily quod he yt would I. I
put case quod I that ye had not dowted before b^t had been i^ your self at
clear point yt y^ Arryans opynyo^ were the troth / ^et ye would against
Arrius and all his / and against your own mind also lene unto his word / whom
god had beden you bylefe. what else quod he? what if ye asked him q I whythere
god have suffycyently showed yt point in scripture / so that yt may by the
wordys of holy wrytt well and euydentlye be proved / and yt he told you ye /
And that theruppon he would bring in all the textys that ye had well in
remembrance all ready / and yt ye laid against them all that you could lay
for the contrary / so ferforth that wha^ each of you had laid all your textys
and all your glosys that either of you both could bring forth till ye both
confessyd yt neither of ye both could any ferther thing find therein / he
saying still yt his way were the truth and yt he had by sc^ypture well proved
yt unto you / and your self on the the other side for all that ever ye had hard
him say / parceyuyng in your own mind none other but that ye had by scripture
better prouyd the the other perte / which would ye now bileue / that way that as
far^e as ye see god says him self in holy scripture / or else that man whom god
sent you to and bade you believe? Nay verily q he I would believe him. well
said quod I. But whether would ye only believe him that the trowth of the
matter were against the Arryans / or else would you believe him ferther in yt he
said he had so prouyd yt unto you by scripture. I would q he believe him therein
also. For sith god so had commanded me / and had showed me that he had him
self instructyd that man in what sense y^ scripture were to be understood /
I coud none otherwise think / but that were true / and thowgh it apperyd to
mine own reason the contrary. Uery well said q I. Now if god had said unto you
that ye should believe that man concerning the matter self / and of scripture
had nothing spoken / than would ye have byleuyd him yet in the matter? would ye
not all though he should have told you that he understood no scripture at all?
That is true quod he. Now if he should then have told you that the Arryanys
were herytyques in yt point and their opynion erroniouse and false / ye would
have byleuede him? what else q he. what if he had told you there with quod I that
he wyste nere whyther yt might be well proved by scripture or not? yet would I
quod he nevertheless believe to be true the matter self that he had told me.
what would you than think quod I of those textys that ye reken before well and
plai^ly to prove the contrary? I would q he than reken that they were mente su^
other ways tha^ I could understand. For I could not doubt but being trewly
understood / theye could never wytnes against y^ trouh. In good faith quod
I ye say maruelously well. Do ye not quod I take yt for all one whyther god
bid you do a thing his own mouth or bid you by holy scripture? yes quod he
saui^g / that I take the byddinge by scripture for the more sure. For there wot
I well god speaks and I can not be illuded. Now quod I this man that god
byddeth you go to and in all thing believe him will it make any change in our
matter whyther yt be man or woman? No change at all quod he. what if yt were a
certain known cumpany of men and women to gether quod I would that make any
dyfference. Never a whyt quod he. Than quod I in case yt apere unto you as I
suppose it does to you and to every christen man else / yt in all points of
faith both in thyngys to be byleued above nature / and in things also that are
of nece^^itie to be known and byleuyd / which may be perceived by reason geuyn
us with nature / god gives us in commandment that we shall believe his church
/ than are ye full answered. For than have ye the man that ye must nedys
resort unto for your fynall answer and solusyon of all poyntys and dowtys / in
any wise concerning the salvation of your soul. of which poyntys no man can
deny / but one of the most especial point is to take in holy scripture always
the right sense. Or else if we cannot attain the right understanding / yet
than at the least wise to be sure that we shall avoid and eschew all such
miss taking as might bring us in to any damnable error.

The.xxvii. chapyter
Thauthor prouyth that god has co^mau^did us in all thing necessary to
salvation to give ferme credence and full obedyence unto his church. And a
cause why god will have us bounden to believe.

THat is trothe quod he if this may appear. But where shall it appear that god
co^maundyth us in all such thyngys to believe ye church? For furste me thynkyth
yt were a very strange manner of co^mau^^yng. For of the church be all we that
should as ye say be by god commanded to believe the church / And all we to
gether make the hole church. And what reason were yt than to command us to
believe the church. which were no more in effect / but to bid us all believe us
all / or each of us to believe other. And then if we fell at diverse oppynio^s /
why should the tone part more believe the the other / tha^ be believed of the the other
/ since both the partys be of the church and make ye church among them? saving
that alwey that part seems to believe which best and most clearly can allege
y^ scripture for their opynyo^. For the words of god must break ye strife. He
is only to byleued and his only son of whom him self commanded. Ipsum
audite / here him said the father at the time of his baptysme. And therefore the
man y^ ye speak of whom god sends me to / and whom he byddeth me here and
believe / is our savior Christ only / and not any congregacyon of men. whose
words if we believe before ye words of god / and in the s^ede of the scripture
of god put our trust and con^ydence in ye doctrine and ordinance of ye church
/ it were happily to be fered / lest we fall in the reprofe that is touched in
ye gospel where is said / in vain wurshup they me with the doctrine of me^ /
and where our savior also reproves the scrybes and the pharesyes saying unto
them / wherefore do you break and transgress the commandment of god for your
tradycyons. I trust q I yet at last we shall agree. But myche a do me thi^keth
it is to cu^ to it. But sith we must as ye say and treuth yt is / here our
savior Christ and believe him / is yt enough to here him and believe him / or
be we bysydes that also bounden to obey him? To obey him also q he. For else
were he better vnherd. well said quod I. But whyther are we bounden to here him
and obey him in some things or in all things? In all things quod he without
excepcyo^ that he commands us to do. Tha^ if Christ quod I bydde us believe
and obey his church / be we not bou^de^ so to do. yes quod he? andThan may we
quod ^ no more dowt to be true what so y^ chy^ch byddeth us believe / than the
thing yt our savior him self byddeth us believe / if he bydde us here his
church as his father bad us here him. That is troth q he if he so do / but me
thinks yt were a strange byddyng as I said to bid each of us of bileue
other. It seme^^ not q I so strange a thing to Saint Poule. For he meruelouse
effectually besecheth Christen people to agree to gether all in one mind / and
in the faith to tell one tale / sufferyng no sectis or scismes among them.
which agreement and consent ca^ never be where no man gives crede^ce to other.
But among Christian people yt w^ll sone be / if every man give credence to the
chirch. But yet q he sith all be of the church of diverse parties / which shall
believe which? ye take y^ quod I for a great dowt and a thing very perplex /
which seems me very plain. For either first y^ church has ye treuth and
believe all one way till some one or some few begin yt change / and than
though all be yet of y^ church till some by their obstynacie be gone out or put
out / yet is yt no ^owt but if I will believe y^ church I must believe them yt
still believe that way which all ye hole byleued before / or else if there were
any thing yt was peradventure such / yt in y^ church somtym was dowted and
reputed for vnreueled and unknown / if after yt ye holy chryche fall i^ one
co^se^t upon ye tone side / either by co^me^ determynacyo^ at a general
counsel or by a perfyte perswasyo^ and bylyefe so received thorough
christendo^ yt the Chryste^ people think it a da^pnable error to believe ye
contrary / tha^ if any would after yt take ye contrary way were it one or moo /
were yt few or many / were they learned or unlearned / were they ley people or of
ye clergy / yet ca^ I nothing dowte which per^e to bileue if I will bileue the
chirch. yt is trouht q he. But ye prove me not yet that god has boden me
believe the church. ye sumwhat interrupted me quod I with your other subtylty /
by which ye would yt should seem an absurdytye to bydde us believe the church /
For as much as thereby ye said yt should seem yt we were commanded nothing else
but each to believe other / and than in diverse opynyons taken we coud not wit
which part should believe which. whereof sith I have showed you the contrary
and removed ye block out of the way for stumblyng / we shall I think sone se
yt the other point / that Christ co^mau^dith us to believe his church. For as his
father said of hi^ self here him / so said he of his church wha^ he sent it
abroad to be spread forth. For wha^ he had gathered his church of his apostles
and his dyscyples and theruppo^ set them forth to preche / said he not unto
them / he that hereth you hereth me? Did he not also command yt who so would
not here the church should be reputed and taken as paynyms and publycanys?
That was q he where men would not amend their living. was yt not q I general
where a man would not ami^de any dampnable fawte? yes q he. Is mysbelefe quod I
none such? yes mary q he. Than is quod I the church his Judge upon his
believe / to show him whyther it be true or false. So yt seems quod he. Has
his living quod I no thing a do with faith? How mean you yt quod he? Thus
quod I as if Luther late a friar and having now wedded a Nu^ne / were
commanded to amend his lewd living and put away that harlot whom he abuses
in co^tynuall inceste and sacrylege under ye name of a wife / and he would say
yt he did well enough / and that their vows could not bind them / were he
not bounde^ to believe ye church and obey thereto as well co^cerni^g his bylefe
as his lyui^g? yes verily quod he. Tha^ appears yt quod I that we be by Christ
commanded to here / believe and obey yt church as well in matters of faith as
of manners. which thing well appears also by y^ our lord would y^ who so were
dysobedye^t should be taken as a paynyme or a publycane. Of which.ii. y^ tone
offended i^ mys^yleue the the other in lewd lyui^g. and thus yt appears yt not
only Christ is the man yt ye be sent unto and commanded be god to believe and
obey / but also ye church is the person whom ye be by Christ commanded to
here and believe and obey. And therefore if ye will in faith or lyui^g or a
voydi^g of all da^pnable error yt ye might fall in by mysse understanding of
scriptur take a sure and vnfallyble way / ye must in all these things
her^/believe and obey the church / which is as I say the person whom Christ
sends you to for the sure solucyon of all such doutys / as to the man in
whose mouth he speaks him self and the holy spyryte of his father in heui^.
And surely this is much to be marked. For yt is the perpetual order which our
lord has continued in the governance of good men from the bygynnyg / ye like
as our nature first fell by pride to ye dysobedye^ce of god with inordynate
desire of knowledge like unto god / so has god ever kept man i^ humilytye /
strayni^g him with ye knowledge and co^fessyo^ of his ygnorau^nce / and byndi^g
him to yt obedye^nce of bylyue of certain things whereof his own wit would
verily wene yt contrary. and therefore are we bou^de^ not only to bileue against
our own reso^ y^ poi^tes yt god shows us i^ scriptur / but also yt god
techith his chirch without scriptur and against our own mi^de also / to give
dylygent heryng / ferme credence / and faithful obedience to yt church of
christ / concerning the sense and understanding of holy scripture. Not dowti^g
but since he has comanded his sheep to be fed / he has provided for them
wholesome mete and true doctrine. And that he has therefore so far inspyred
the old holy doctors of his church with the light of his grace for our
instruc^yo^ / that ye doctrine wherein they have agreed and by many agys
conse^ted / is yt very true faith and right way to heuyn / being put in their
minds by the holy hand of him / qui facit vnanimes i^ domo / yt makes y^
church of Christ all of one mind.

The.xxviii. chapyter
The messenger eft sonys objected against this / that we should believe y^
church i^ any thing where we find ye words of scripture semi^g plainly to say
the contrary / or believe y^ old doctors interpretacyons in any necessary
article / where they seem to us to say contrary to ye text. shewi^g yt we may
perceive y^ scripture as well as they might. and ye answer of ye author proui^g
ye authorite of ye old interpters and ye infallible authorite of ye chirch i^
y^ god techith it every truth requysite to ye necessite of ma^nys saluacyo^.
which he proves by a deducey o^ pertely depe^di^g upon natural reso^.

IT seems me quod he that all this goth well that we should believe the church
as christ / as long as they say as Christ says / for some thynkethe meant our
lord. But now if they tell me talis of their own whereof Christ never spoke
word nor mencyo^ made thereof in holy scripture I may tha^ say with ye prophet
Hieremie / no^ mitteba^ prophetas et ipsi currebant. Non loquebar ad eds et
ipsi prophetabant / those prophetis (quod our lord) ran forth of their own
head and I sent them not / And prophesied of their own heddes wha^ I spoke
nothing to them. And than how myche may I more say so / if they say me a
thing whereof Christ or holy scripture says the contrary / shall I believe the
church above chyrste? were that a good humylyte to be obedyent more to men
than to god? More ought I me thinks to believe god above speaking in his holy
scripture him self / than all the old fathers if they make a gloss against
the text. Nor they do not them self for their opynyons say and write /
that they have them by inspyracyon / or by reuelacyon / or by miracle. But by
wisdom / study / dylygence / and collacyo^ of one text with a another. By
all which meanys men may now perceive the sentence of scripture as well as they
might than. And if ye will peradventure say that grace help the^m which I will
well agree / than will I say again that goddys grace is not so far worn out
yet / but y^ yt may as well help us as yt help them / and so may we be for
the right understanding of scripture equal with them / and peradventure one
ace above them. whereby when we proceyue that they went wrong and other after
them / shall we than call yt humylyte so to captyue and subdue our
understanding / whereby god has happily given us light to perceive their
errors / yt without thank geuyn him therefore we shall so set his gift at
naught / that we shall believe them before him self / and tell him yt him self
bad so^ ^ therefore me think where y^ old doctors or the holy church tells
me the tale that god does / there he byddeth me believe them. But where god
says one thing in scripture and they tell me a another / yt thynkith me that
I should in no wise believe them. well quod I than in su^what ye say ye will
bileue the chirch but not in all. In any thing bysyde scripture ye will not /
nor in the interpretacion of scripture ye will not. And so where ye said yt ye
believe ye church in su^what / in very deed ye believe ye church i^ right naught.
For wherein will ye believe yt if ye believe it not in the interpretacio^ of
scripture? For as touching the text ye believe the scripture self and not ye
chirch Me thinks q he the text is good enough and plain enough nedynge no
gloss if yt be well considered and every part compared with other. Hard yt
were quod I to find any thing so plain that yt should need no gloss at all.
In faith quod he theye make a glo^e to su^ textys / yt be as plain as yt is
y^ twice two make four. why quod I needs yt no gloss at all? I trow so quod
he. Or else the devil is o^ yt / I wysse quod I / and yet though ye wole bileue
one yt would tell you yt twice two ga^ders made always four gese / yet ye would
be aduysed ere ye byleued him that would tell you yt twyse two geese made always
four ganders. For theri^ might ye be deceived. And him would ye not believe at
all that would tell you that twice two gese would always make four horse. Tut
quod he this is a merry matter. They must be all yt twyse twain always of one
kind. But gese and horse be of diverse. well quod I than every man that is
neythere gose nor horsese^th well yt there is one gloss yet. But now quod I
the geese and ye ganders be both of one kind and yet twyse two gese make not
always four ganders. A sweet matter quod he / ye wot what I mean well enough.
I think I do quod I^ but I think if ye bring yt forth yt will make a nothere
gloss to your text as plain as your text is / and ye will in all holy
scripture have no gloss at all. And yet will ye have colla^yon made of one
text with a another / and show how they may be agreed to gether as though all that
were no gloss. ye quod he but would you yt we should believe the church if yt
sent a gloss that will in no wise agree with ye text / but that it aperyth
plainly that the text well considered says clean the contrary? To who^ does
yt apere quod I so plainly / wha^ yt aperyth one to you / and to the hole
chirch a another? yet if I se yt so quod he / though holy doctors and all the
hole church would tell me the contrary / me thynkythe I were no more bounden
to bileue them all yt the scripture menith as they take yt / than if they would
all tell me that a thing were white which I se my self is blak. Of late quod I
ye would believe ye chirch in sum thing. And now not only ye would believe it in
nothing / but also where as god would the church should be your judge / ye would
now be judge over the church. And ye will by your wit be judge whyther the
church in the understanding of holy scripture yt god has written to his
church / do judge a right or err. As for your white and blak / never shall it
be yt ye shall se the thing blak yt all other shall se white. But ye may be sure
yt if all other se it white and ye take it for blak / your eyene be sore
deceyuyd. For ye chirch will not I think agree to call it other than yt semyth
to the^. And much maruayle were yt y^ ye should i^ holy scripture se beter tha^
ye old holy doctors and Crystys hole church. But furste quod I ye must consider
that ye and I do not talk of one doctor or twain / but of the consent and
comen agreement of ye old holy fathers. Nor that we speak not of the doctrine of
one man or two in the church / but of of the comen consent of the church. we
speak not also of any sentence taken in any text of holy scripture / whereby
rysyth no dout or question of any necessary article of our faith or rule of
our living / For in other bye matters may there be taken of one text.x. sensys
paraduenture and all good enough without wara^tyse of the best / But we speak
of such two diverse and contrary sensys taken / as if the tone be true the
the other must nedys be false / and that as I say concerning some necessary point
of our faith or rule of our living / which is also dependyng upon faith
and reducyble thereto. As if one would boldly break his vow for yt he thought
that no man were bou^de^ to keep any. Sych poyntys I say let us consider they
be that we speak of. And this remembryd between us / than will we su^what se
what your sayng does prove. I shall not myche need quod I to styk with you in
dysputi^g by what meanis the scripture is understood / sith ye be agreed with
nature and dylygence the grace of god must nedys go / or else no dylygence or
help of nature can prevail. Nor I will nothing deny you / but that god may and
will also / give his grace now to us as he gave of old to his holy doctors / if
there be as mich towardnes and no more let or impedymente in our self than was
in them. I will also grant you that we may now by ye same menis by which they
might than / understand the scripture as well as they did than / and I will not
mic^ styk with you for one a^e better. And were it not for the synnys that we
sink in / we might parcase understand yt beter by quater tredeuce / having
their labors therein and our own therwyth. But sith I am so gentle to grant
you so many things / I trust ye will grant me this one / that if any such
point of our faith as god would have me^ bounden to believe / they did
understand ye scripture one way and we a another / being the tone to the the other
so clean contrary yt if the tone were true ye the other must needs be false / ye
will tha^ graunt^ I say yt either they err or we. That must nedys be quod he.
ye will also grant quod I that in such poyntis as we speak of / the error
were dampnable. For we speak of those poyntys only / to the belief whereof god
will have us bounden. I grant quod he. For dampnable were yt in such case to
believe wrong. And wrong should they or we believe if they or we believed a wrong
article / because they or we thought yt the scripture affyrmyd yt. And as
da^pnable were yt and yet mich more / if we believed a thing whereof we believed
yt the scripture affyrmyth ye contrary. For the^ believed we that the scripture
were false. This is q I very well said. ^But for the more playnnes let us put
one example or twayn. And what point rather than the ar^ycle towchynge the
equalite i^ godhed of our savior christ with his ^ather? For if the contrary
belef^ were true / than were this always damnable and plain idolatry. Uery
trothe quod he. May not quod I the tothe^ example be the matter that we have in
hand / co^cerni^g saints relics / images and pylgrymages. which thyngys if
yt be (as ye say many reken yt) ydolatrye / tha^ is yt yet worse to do therein
as we do / than if our byleefe were wrong in the tothere point. And that as
myche worse / as the sayntys or the ymagys either / be worse than ye holy
manhood of Christ. That is q he very true. Tha^ q I let the furst point alone
because therein we be all agreed / and speak of the second if tholde fathers
took the scryptures one way and we the contrary. Though yt might be yt we were
able to understand the scryptures as well as they / yet if they so understood
them yt they thought this ki^d of worship not for beden but co^mau^did and
plesau^t to god / and we new men o^ the the other side thought yt utterly forbeden
and holden for ydolatry / the tone perte did not in deed understand the
scripture right / but were in a dampnable error. That will no man deny q he.
I doubt not now q I but yt your self sees very well how many thi^gys I might
here lay for them to prove you yt they erryd not so. Furste their wyttys as
much as our new me^nys / their ^ylyge^ce as great / their erudycyon (...) their
study as faruent / their devotion hoter / their number far greter / their time
co^tynued longer by many agys parseueryng / the contrary oppynyo^s in few and
those always sone fadyd / they taken always for catholyke / ye contrary perte for
heretykys. Here might I lay you the holiness of their life and ye plentye of
their grace well apperynge thereby. And yt our lord therefore opened their eyes
and suffered and caused them to se ye trothe. And albeyt he used theri^ none
open miracle nor sensyble reuelacyo^ / whereof as ye say they none allege or
pretend for the proof of their opynio^s in their interpretacyons of holy
scripture / yet vsyd he the secret supernatural mean / by which his grace
assystent with good me^ y^ labor therefore / by mocio^s insensyble to them self /
inclynyth their assent unto the true side / and that thus the old holy fathers
did in the point yt we speak of and in such other / parceyue ye right se^ce of
holy scripture so farforth at the lest wise / as they well knew yt yt was not
contrary to their belief. And here might I lay you also yt if yt had been
otherwise and yt they had therein da^nably been deceyuid / than living and dye^g
in dampnable error they coud not have been sayntys / as god god has showed
the^ to be by many a thousand miracle both i^ their lyuys and after their
dethys. with this might I also lay and very well conclude / that sith those
holy doctors and the church / be (as by their bookys plainly apperethe) all of
one faith in this point and such other / yt there by well apperyth yt the
church is in the treuth / and is not in the understanding of ye scripture yt
spekyth of ye matter any thing deceyuyd / but they clearly deceyuyd yt do
understand those textes of holy scripture to the contrary. These thi^^gys as I
say and yett many other mo might I lay. But sith ye did your self put the
church and them both in one case / and so they be in deed / I will rather prove
you the treuth of them by the treuth of the church / than ye treuth of ye
church by the treuthe of the^. and so semyth me good reason. For surely sith
they were but members of his church / god had his special cure upon them
most especyall for the profit of his church / by whose hole corpse he more
settyth than by any member thereof / saint / apostle / euangelyst / or other.
And therefore must I yet ask you again whether the church may have any dampnable
error in ye faith by mystaki^g of scripture or otherwise. That is q he sumwhat
hard to tell. Now quod I sumwhat I marvel that ye remember not yt your self
has agred all ready / yt these words of Christ spoken unto Peter I have prayed
that thy faith shall never fail / were not only meant by the faith i^ Peter his
own person / but also by the faith of ye church. For to him was yt spoken as
head of ye church? yes I remember q he right well yt I agreede yt. But I
remember also yt notwtstanding mine agremente ye were content yt we should
enserch again and again ye matere otherwise bysyde / wherein mine agreement
should not bind me. Lo quod I that had I forgotten again But let it tha^ alone
for ye while and tell me this. Did not Christ entende to gader a floke and
congregacyon of peole yt should serve god and be his special people? yes quod
he that is very truth / For so sayethe plain scripture of Christ in sundry
placys. As where the fathere of heaven says unto Christ in ye psalm /
Postula a me and dabo tibi gen^es hereditatem tuam / ask of me and I shall
give the paynym people for thine enherytaunce. and many other placys. And else
undoubtedly his hole co^mi^g had been in manner frustrate and in vain. That
people quod I which should be a^ e^herytaunce ^yd he entende should endure for
his own days only while he lived her^/or else that y^ should go forth and
co^tynue long after. Nay quod he that shall co^tynue while the world lasts
here till domys day / and after in heaven eternally. Shall this people q I have
among them the knowledge and understanding what he would they should do to
please god with all? ye q he. why^her shall they quod I have this knowledge for
a while i^ the bygynnyng and than lose yt / or shall they have it still as
long as they continue? Here he byga^ a little to stagger. why quod I ca^ ye
call the his people any longer if they lose ye knowledge how to serve him and
please him? if they for sloth to do their duty as slake seruauntys su^tyme do
/ yet may they mend and do beter a another time. But if they lose the knolege of
their duty / t^a^ wot they nere which way to mend / As he that knows
fornicacyon for syn / may fall by frayletye to fornycacyon. But sith he
knowethe yt for naught / though he sinnid more in ye doing than if he had not
known the prohybycyon / yet does ye knowledge give him warning and occacyon of
repentance and amendment / which must nedys lack if he had lost ye knowledge.
Uppo^ this he granted yt it must nedys be that this people must nedys have
always the knolege how to serve and please our lord / or else they ceaced to be
his people. Is not this people q I called ye chirch? yes quod he. Tha^ the chyr^h
quod I always has and ^lway shall by your reason have the knowledge and
understanding / how god may be seruid and plesed. Troth q he Is quod I that
knolege fully had without the knolege of such things as god bi^deth us to
bileue? Nay q he. what if we knew the^ i^ such wise q I as we could rehe^se
the^ o^ our fi^gers e^dys and yet byleuyd them not to be true / would this
knowledge serve? In no wise q he. for if ye byleued the to be false / though ye
so knew the^ yt ye could rehearse them by row / ye coud take no warni^g by
the^ to plese and serve god with the^ / which is the caus^ wherefore the church
should of necessyt^ know the^. This is q I v^ry well said. tha^ since ye grant
yt ye church shall ever e^dure / and yt it coud not ^dure without ye knolege of
sich things as may plese god / nor those things can be all known if knolege
laked of those things yt god byndeth us to bileue / nor ye knolege of the^ any
thing sarue to the knolege and warni^g given us of goddys pleasure but if we
not only can tell them but also believe them / which bylyefe ye grant is
callede faith / of this yt consequently follows that the church always has
and all ways shall have the knowledge and bylyefe of such thyngys as god will
have yt bounde^ to believe. That is troth q he because god has left holy
scripture to ye church / and therein is all / and ye church byleuyth that to be
true. and therefore therein and thereby has the chirch all that warnyng and
lernyng of gods pleasure that ye speak of / without which yt ca^ not endure.
what if god quod I had left ye scripture to ye chirch lokked up in a close
cheste / and that no man should look therein / would that have served? Nay perde
quod he. what if he had left hit open and written in such wise that no man
coud read yt? That were all one quod he. what if every man quod I could read yt
and no man understand yt? As little would yt serve quod he as the the other. Than
quod I sith yt seruyth the church to learn goddys pleasure theri^ / and that
can yt not as ye grant your self but if ye church understand yt / yt
follows of this yt the church understands it. And thus every way for the
faith and knowledge of goddys pleasure if yt be as ye say all known by the
scripture and no part otherwise / yet always to this point ye bring yt in the
end / yt the church has the sure knowledge thereof. And than if yt be so / ye
shall not as ye lately said ye should / in any diverse textes of scripture
seming to make a dowtouse article of our faith / and to bring in questyone
what we be bounden to believe / after ye have red i^ scripture all that ca^ be
red / and herd on both sides all that can be said / than take which part
seems to your self most probable. Nor if ye stand still for all yt in a dowt
/ tha^ after your bitter prayers made to god for his grace and gyde i^ ye
choice / go take you the tone part at adventure and cleue thereto / as though
ye were sure by your confidence in god / that his grace had inclined your
asse^t to ye surer side. But since he has showed you plainly by reasone that
he has geuyn his church in all such things knowledge of the truth / ye will
take the sure way and put your self out of all perplexity / if in the point
yt self and the scryptures that touch it / ye take for the truth that way that
the church tecythe you theri^ / how so ever the matter seem bysyde unto your
self or to any man else.

The.xxix. chapyter
The author proves by scripture that god instructethe the church of Christ /
in every truth necessaryly requesyte for our salvation.

TRuly q he ye wind yt well about. But yet ye made as though ye would have
showed that god had in scripture told me / that he had and ever would tell his
church the truth in all such matters. And now ye bring yt to the point /
not y^ holy scripture tellythe me the tale but ma^nys reason. And suerly as I
showed you before / I dare not well trust reasone in matters of faith and of
holy scripture. I bygane quod I to prove yt you by scripture / and ye than put
me out in the bygynnyng. How be yt this reason has scripture for his
foundacyon and ground. And though yt sum what bilde farther thereon / yet is it
not reason always to be mystrusted where faith standyth not against it / nor god
says not the contrary. Except reason be so far out of crede^ce with you
that ye will not now believe him if he tell you that twyse twain make four. I
wene ye will fare by reason as one did o^s by a ^alse shrew. he swear yt he would
not for.xx.li. here him say his creed. For he knew him for such a liar that he
thought he should never bileue his creed after / if he hard yt onys of his mouth.
How be yt quod I let us yet see whyther god him self in scripture tell you the
same tale or no. God tellyth you in scripture yt he would be with his chirch to
the end of the world. I think ye dowte not thereof / but those wordys he
spoke to the hole church that than was and that ever shall be from thappostels
days continued till ye end of ye world. That i^ good faith quod he must nedys
be so. Tha^ were this i^ good faith enough quod I for our purpose / sith no
man dowte^h wherefore he will be with his church / except we should think yt he
would be therwythe for nothing. wherefore should he be with yt but to keep yt
and preserve yt with thassystence of his gracyous prese^te from spyrytuall
myschiefe specially / and of all other specially from infidelytie and from
idolatrye? which was the special thing from which he called his chirch out of
the gentyllys. which else as for moral ver^ews and polytycall if they had not
lackyd the right cause and end of referrynge their actys to god / were many
of them not far under many of us. Let us go ferther. Does he not i^ ye.xiiii
xv. and.xvi. chapyter of saint John^ again and again repete / that after his
going he will cum again to them / And says he will not leave them orphanys as
fatherles chyldern / but will cu^ to them again him self? Let us add now
thereunto the wordys before rehearsed / that he wylbe with them till the worlds
end / and yt aperyth plain yt he mente all this by his hole church yt should
be to the worlds end. wha^ he said unto the^ I call you friends / for all that
I have hard of my father I have made knowene to you / he spoke as to his
perpetual church and not to thapposteles alone / but if he said to them alone
these wordys also I command that ye love each other / so yt none should love
each othere after but only they. Now lest the thyngys that he taught them
should by the church after be forgoten / which was more to be dowted than of
them self that hard it / he said unto them also / These thyngys quod he have
I spoken to you abidinge here with you. But the ^omforter which is the holy
ghost who^ me father shall send i^ my name / he shall tech you all thing / and
he shall put you in mind and rememberaunce of all thing that I shall have said
unto you. So that here ye se that he shall again always tech ye chirch of new /
the old lessons of Christ. And he said also to them / yt this comforter this
holy ghost y^ spyryte of troth / should be sent to abide with them for ever /
which can not be mente but of ye hole church. For the holy gooste was not
sent hither into the earth here to dwell with the appostels for ever / for
they dwelled not so long here. Now if the spryte of truth shall dwell in the
church for ever / how ca^ ye church err in perceiving of the truth / in
such thyngys I mean as god will bynd the^ to know or shall be necessary for them
to know? For only of such things me^t our lord / when he said that the holy
ghost shall teache them all thing. For as saint Poule says / the
manife^^acyon and showing of ye spyryte / is to the utility and profyt. This
holy spyrite also was not promised by our savior christ / yt he should only
tell his church again his words / but he said ferther / I have quod he
besides all this many things to say to you / but ye be not able to bear them
now. But wha^ he shall cum yt is the spyryte of troth / he shall led you in
to all truth. Lo our lord said not that the holy ghost should write unto his
church all troth / but that he should led them by secret insperacyon and
inclynacyon of their hearts in to all troth / in which must needs be
conceived both informacyo^ and right believe of every necessary article / and
of the right and true sense of holy scripture / as far as shall be requysyte
to conserve the church from any dampnable error. Now when the holy ghost
shall by gods promise / be for this purpose abiding in the church for ever /
and Christ him self has also said that he will not leave his church as
orphanys / but will cum him self / and be with yt unto the end of the world /
and says also that his father is in him and he in his father / and yt his
father and he be both one thing / not both one person but both one
substance / and with the holy gooste both one god / than must yt needs follow
that to the worldys end / there is with the church resydent the hole trynytye.
whose assystence being to the church perpetual / how can yt at any time fall
from true faith to false errous and heresies?

The.xxx. chapyter
where as ye messe^ger had thought before / that yt were herd to bylyue any
thing certeynly save holy scripture though the church did agree therein and
command yt / the Authore shows that saving for thauthoryte of the church /
men coud not know what scripture they should believe. And here is hit showed yt
god will not suffer the church to be deceived in ye choice of ye very scripture
of god from any counterfete.

NOw is yt I suppose well and clearly proved by scripture the thing that I
promised / that is to wytt that the church ca^ not err in any such
substauncyall article as god will have us bounden to believe. But yet for as
myche as ye regard nothing but scripture only / this would I feign wit of
you whyther ye believe that christ was borne of a vyrgyn. what else quod he. why
believe you yt quod I? The gospel shows me so quod he. what if yt did not
quod I / were tha^ your creed out of credence but if he bring witness with
him? The creed quod he is a thing by yt self. yet is yt quod I no part of ye
gospel as ye pater noster is. And yet I think if gospel had never been
written / ye would have byleued your creed. So think I to q he. And wherefore q
I / but for because ye church should have showed you so? But let our creed alone
a while and go we to the gospel self. which gospel tells you yt christ was
borne of a vyrgyn? The gospel of saint luke quod he. How know you yt q I? For
I read yt so quod he in the book. ye read q I such a book. But how know you
that saint Luke made yt? How know I quod he other books / but by yt they bear
the namys of their authors wryte^ upon them? Know you yt well thereby quod I?
Many books be there that have false inscrypcyons / and are not the books of
them yt they be named by. That is troth q he. But yet though men did
peradventure err and fail i^ the name / as if he should repute a book of
Stories to be made by Titus Liuius which he neuere made but su^ other honest
cu^ni^g man / yet were the book nether less elygaunt nor less true therefore.
Nor in like wise if the church did mysse take the very name of sum
euau^gelyste and gospel / yet were the gospel never ye less true. That is
quod I well said. But how be ye sure that the matter of ye book is true? Mary
quod he for I am. That is quod I the reason yt a maid lays for her own
knowledge of her mayde^hed. But she could tell a nothere how she knows she
has yt / saving that she is loathe to cu^ so nere as to be a known that she
could tell how she might lose yt. But here is no such fere. Tell me therefore
whereby wot ye that ye matter of that book is true? I think quod he yt god
shows me so. That is well thought quod I. But he told yt you not mouth to
mouth. No q he. But he has told yt to other in the bygynnynge or else yt was
well known in the bygynnynge when he wrote yt. And he was known and byleuyde
by his living / and the miracles that god did for hi^. And after that yt was
onis known / the knowledge went forth fro man to man. And god has so wroght
with us that we believe yt because the hole church has always done so before our
days. Now cum you quod I to the very point. for many thyngys has been true
y^ in procys after has left to be byleuyd. And many a thing has in the
bygynnynge been known for false / and yet has after happed to be byleuyd. But
the gospels and holy scripture / god prouydeth that though percase sum of it
may perish and be lost whereby they might have harm but not fall in error
(for the faith should stand though the scrypturys were all gone) yet shall he
never suffer his chirch to be deceived in that point / that they shall take for
holy scripture any book yt is not. And therefore says holy saint Auste^ / I
should not believe the gospel / but if yt were for the church. And he says
good reasone. For were yt not for the spyryte of god keeping ye troth thereof in
his church / who could be sure which were the very gospels? There were many
that wrote the gospel. And yet has the church by secret instinct of god /
reiectyde the remenaunte and chosen out these four for the sure undoubted
true. That is quod he sure so. This is quod I so sure so / yt Luther him self
is dryuyn of necessytye to grant this / or else he perceyuyth yt there were
none hold nor surtie i^ scripture yt self / if the church might be suffrede
by god to be deceived in yt point and to take for holy scripture yt writing
that in deed were not. And therefore he confessyth that this must nedys be a
sure infallyble ground / that god has geuyn this gift unto his church / that
his church ca^ always dyscerne ye word of god from the word of me^. In good
faith quod he that must nedys be so / or else all would fail. Quod I than ye
that would believe the church in nothing / nor give sure credence to ye
tr^dycyon of the church but if yt were p^ued by scripture / now se yt prouyd to
you / that ye could not believe ye scripture but if yt were proved to be
scripture by the judgment and tradycyo^ of the church. No quod he but when I
have learned onys of the church / that yt is holy scripture and the word of god
/ than I bileue it better than I believe all the church. I might by a light
person sumtyme know a much more substancyall man. And yet wha^ I know him I
will believe him much beter tha^ him by whom I know him if they varied i^ a
tale and were co^^rary. Good reason quod I. But the church b^ddith you not
believe the contrary of that the scripture says. But he tellythe you yt in
such placys as ye would better bileue the scripture than the church / there ye
understand not ye scripture. For what so ever wordys yt spekyth / yet yt
meanyth not the contrary of that ye chirch techeth you. And the chirch can not
be deceived in any such weghtye point. whereby shall I know q he? why be we at
ye point yet quod I? have we so sone forgotten the perpetual assystence of the
trynyte in his church / and the prayoure of Christ to keep ye faith of his
church fro fayli^ge / and the holy ghost sen^e of purpose to keep i^ ye chirch
the rememberaunce of Christ's words and to lead them in to all troth? what
would yt have profited to have put you i^ ^he rememberaunce of the assystense of
god with the chylderne of Israel walkyng with the^ in the cloud by day / and i^
the pyler of fire by night in their erthly viage / and thereby to have provide
you the much more special assystence of god with his christian church in their
spyrytuall vyage / wherein his especyall goodness well declarith his tender
delygence / by that he does vouchsafe to assyste and comfort us with the
co^tynuall presence of his preciouse body in the holy sacremente? All this
would not help / if manyfeste reasone that I made you / and euydent scripture
that I rehersyd you / can not yet prynte in your heart a perceyuyng that
thassystence of god in his church must nedis preserve his church from all
damnadle errors in ye faith / and give his church so ferforth the
understanding of scripture / that they may well perceive y^ no part thereof
well understand / sta^dith against any article that the church bileuith / as
percell of their christian faith. Nay q he I perceive yt well when I remember
it / but it was not ready in remembrance.

The.xxxi. chapyter
In that the church can not err in the choice of the true scripture / the
author prouythe by the reason which the kyngys hyghnes in his noble and most
famous book obiectith against luther / that the church can not err in the
necessa^y understanding of scripture. And finally thauthor in this chapyter
does breuely recapi^^e certain of the pryncypall poyntys yt be before proved.
And therwyth ends the first book.

yEt would I quod I ask you one thing wherefore think you will no^ Christ
suffer his church to be deceyuyde in ye descerninge of holy scripture from
othere writing / and suffer them to take a book of hol^ scripture / that were
none in deed? Lest me^ might quod he of sum false book reputed holy scripture
/ have great occacyon geuyn them to co^ceyue a wrong dyctryne and wrong
opinions of ye faith / if god would suffer his chirch to take a false devised
book for holy scripture and for his own holy wordys. ye say quod I very
truth. Now what if in the very scripture he should suffer his church mysse
take the very sentence in a matter substanciall of our faith / were they not in
like perell to fall by false understanding i^ to like errors / as they might by
false wryti^g? Yes that they were qu^^ he. Forsooth q^od I so (...) they and in
myche more. For in ^ false ^^^ke mystaken for scripture th^^gh they ^^d yt in
never so high re^ereine for some good things that they foun^^ in yt / and
thereby should have gr^^t (...) to believe the falfe errors written in the same
/ yet ^^^yng ^s ^he church always shall have / the true faith / first in
heart they should find many shyftys to keep out the errors. But now if they
falsely should understand the true scripture / there were no way to escape
from dampnable errors. And therefore may I say to you as the kyngys hyghnes
most prude^tly laid unto Luther / sith god will not suffer his ^hyrche to
mystake a book of scripture for parell of dampnable errors that might ensue
thereon / and like parel may there ensue by the my^construynge of the sentence
as by the mistaking of the book / yt must needs follow that god will in
thyngys of our faith no more suffer them to take a false sentence for true /
than to take a false book for scripture. And with this reason his hyghnes
concluded him so clearly / that he durst never synnys for shame touch that
point again / nor any color could lay / but that upon his own confession in
all substauncyall poyntys concerning the faith or knowledge of virtue
pleasant to god / the church has so right understanding of scripture / that
yt well and trewly perceyueth / that no text therein can be right understood /
against any article that y^ church byleueth for thing to be byleued of
necessytye. And this point durst he never synnys touch (...) S^rely quod your
^rend I (...) not though he did not. For this point is (...) ^e cowld not /
and I am here in fu^ly satysfyed. Than he you q I satysfyed in this also / that
the faith of the church is a right rule to ca^ry with you to the study of
^^rypture / to sh^pe you the understanding of the ^e^tis by / and so to take
them as they may always agree therewythall. ^e yt quod he. Than are ye, quo^
I also f^lly answered in this that y^ where ye said ye should not byl^ue the
church tellyng a tale of their own / but only telling you^ scripture / y^
now perceive that in such thyngys as we speak of / that is to wit
necessary poyntys of our faith / if they tell you a tal^ which if yt were
false were dampnable / ye mus^e believe and may be sure that sithe the church
can not in such things err / yt is very true all that the church in such
thyngys tells you. And that yt is not their own word but the word of god
though^ yt be not in scripture. That appears well quod h^. Than are ye q I as
fully ^atysfyed that where ye lately said that y^ were a dysobedye^ce to god
and preferri^g of ye church before him self / if ye shall believe ye church in
such things as god in his holy scripture says him self the co^tr^ry / ye
now perceive yt (...) in (...) wy^e (...) ^o. But sith his church in such
thy^gys as we (...) can ^ot ^rre / yt (...) that ye ^^ryp^^re (...) god (...)
^e contrary to the f^yth of ye chyrch^ That is very (...) qu^d ^e. Than yt is
as true quod I that ye ^e ferther f^lly answered in the ^^^ncypall point / that
the scryptures laid against y^agys and pylgrymages and wo^shyp of saints /
make no thing against them. And also that those thyngys / ymagys I mean and
pylgrymagys and ^rayeng to sayntys / are thyngys ^^od and to be had ^ honor in
Crystyschyrch / sith the church byleueth so. Which as ye grant and se cause
why ye so should grant / can in such poyntys not be suffered for the special
assyste^ce of god and instruc^yon of the holy ghoost to fall in error. And so
^e ^e we for ^his ^^ter at last with much work come^ to ^n e^de. And therefore
will we now to dinner. And your other obiec^yons that y^ have laid / by which ye
would pro^e those things reprouable and make them some ydolatrye / which we
deferred before / those will we talk of after dinner. By my truth / quod he I
have a another tale to tell you yt all this ^er^ granted / turnyth us yet in to
as myth vncertayntye as we were in before. Ye q I th^^ have we well wal^^^d
after ye balade / The ferther I go y^ more behind. I pray you what thing is
that. For that long I to here yet ere we go. Nay quod he yt were bettre ye dyne
first. My lady will I went be angry with me / that I keep you so long
therfro. For I hold yt now well toward t^^l^e. And yet more angry w^lde wa^e
with me if I should ma^^ you s^t and (...) at your (...)/as yt would I wot
well m^^^ ^n the ^^ter if is wy^^s yt were. If I were quod I like my wife I
should (...) more thereon now and e^e no me^^ for longing to know. But come on
th^^ and let us dyne first / and ye shall tell us after.

The end of the first book.
The second book.
The first ch^pyter.
The mes^enger recapytelyng certain thyngys before proved / and for his part
agreynge that the church of Christ can not in any nece^^^ry article of ye
faythf^ll in any d^mpnable error / does put in dowte and questyon which is
the very church of Christ / alledgyng that they peradventure whom we call
heretyques will say that th^ym self is y^ church and not we. Whereof the author
sh^weth the contrary / declaryng wh^^by we may know yt they ca^ not be ye
chyrch^

AFter dinner we w^lked in to ye gardyn. And there shortly sytting in an ^ther
/ ^egan to go forth in ou^ matter / d^^y^ynge him to show what thing might
that be / that m^de our long f^renone pro^^^^^ fr^^^r^t / and left us as
uncertain a^ we began. Sir q he that shall I shortly show you. Where as there
was pryncypally in questy^n whyther worshyppyng of ymagys and relyques / and
prayeng to sayntys / and going on pyl^ry^^ges / were lawful or not / and that
I ^^t you in mind that me^ laid against them certain textys of holy
scryp^ure / and also said unto you yt yt seemed the textes self which be the
wordys of g^d ^^re of more authoryte against them the^ the glo^ys of
(...)/that in such wise expowne the textys as they may sem^ to make for them
/ ye laid on the other side the consent and agreement and come^ catholyke faith
of the church / which ye said / and in deed to say the troth b^th by reason
and by scripture ye proved / that yt cowld^ not be err^nyouse / and that the
church could not err^ in the faith that god would have kn^wen and byleued. Ye
proved y^ matter also by miracles. In which when I laid diverse things mouynge
men to dowte / partly lest they were not true / but specially lest they
were not done by god for corroboracyon of the faith / but were per^ase by
goddys sufferaunce done by the devil for our delusyon / deseruyng so to be
served by our falling from the worship of god him self to the worship of
his cre^turys / ye proved me yet again that ye miracles were true / and that
they mu^^ nedys be done by god. And that ye proved me by this that yt should
else follow / that the church had a wrong believe and a dampnable. Which
^fte^^nys ye proved well and substau^cyally to be i^possyble. And for as much
as there fell in the way / occasyon to s^eke of the contraryetye that seemed
sometime to fall between the textys of holy scripture self and the come^
per^^^syo^ and faith of the church / where I s^yd that yt was thought
reasonabl^ to believe y^ scripture being gods (...) ^^rdys rather than the
wordys (...)/yt therein proved that the comen^ayth of the church was as well
godd^s own words as was holy scrypt^^e self / and of as great authoryte /
(...) ^^uden^ in scripture should (...) to try examyn and judge the (...) faith
of Crystes church by ye (...)/but by the catholyque faith ^f Crystys church
should examy^e and ^xp^wne the textys of scrypt^r^. And that in the study of
scripture this we^^ the sure way / wherein should give y^ said great light
the wrytyng^ of the old holy doctors / whereby we ^e acerteyned that the faith
that the church has now / is the same faith and the same points that they
had than of old in every age and every time. And in this part ye proved yet
again by r^ason and holy scripture / that the church has by the techynge of
god and the holy ghoost the right vnderst^ndynge of scripture / in all poyntys
that are of necessyte to be known. And theruppon eftsonys ye deduced and
proved that no text of the scry^t^^e w^ll understood could (...) the
worsh^^pynge of (...) and r^lyques and the seeking of (...)/but that all these
(...) be ^^ll proved good and pleasaunt^ to god / and the miracles done in
such placys done by god / syche his (...) so informs and (...) his church
in so grett and so (...)cyall an article so hyghly (...) the honor or
dishonor of god / (...) yt can not be suffered to fall to sup^r^^ycyon and
ydolatry instead of faith and honor done (...) god. And this is q ge as far
as I (...) and effect of all that has (...) might gr^unte that that the
church does not (...)/and that the church h^th the right faith / and that the
church does not mys^^ take the scripture. And when all this were agreed / he
might say that the church peradventure does not ^yl^ue as ye say it does. For
he mygh^ happily deny the church to be that people that ye take yt for / and
say that yt is the people that byleu^th as he byleueth / that is to wit all
th^se kinds of worship to be wrong / ^^d that byleueth them who^ ye take
for the church to believe wrong. If he and his company quod I be the church /
he must tell where his fel^wes be? Why so q he if me^ should ask you and me
where the church as / we co^^de tell no one place but many (...). Let him quod
I in like wise assygne some companyes that be known for congregacyons ^o
gether in diverse countrees. Why quod h^ in the beginning and a good w^yle after
/ ye church of Cry^^ in every pl^ce ^ydde yt self / that men ^owlde not t^ll
in any (...) they were / nor (...) out and ^hew^ (...) (...) (...) (...) is
gone out of the gate of goddys church before actual exco^munycacyon / and
fallen of the body of y^ vyn^y^rde. And if they be secret / neither
professynge their heresies nor actually being accursed and cast out / they be
in the church but not perfytly of yt. But in such wise i^ ma^er thereof be they
/ as a ded hand is rather a burden in the body / than verily any membre
organe or instrument thereof. And therefore says s^i^t John^ as I said before /
that the heretyques be gone out of us / but they were not of us. For if they
had been of us they would have tarried with us. Meaning thereby not as some would
have yt seem / yt a good man is not of y^ church nor in goddys ^auour while he
is good / because he happeth to wax worse afterward. But he means that in y^
they went their way from us / they showed that they were naught in deed
while they were with us. And ^o though they were with us / yet were they not of
us. For though heretyques and infydelys be among faithful and well byleuynge
people / yet be they perd^ (...) of the^. And so it appears as ye s^yd before
/ that the church of Christ is before all the chyrches of heretyques / and that
all congregacyons of heretyques have comen out of the church of Christ That is
very true quod he. ^ell quod I if that be true as yt is in deed / tha^ can no
(...) in Bohe^^ be y^ r^^ht church. For the church (...) we call the chirch
that byleueth as (...) by^^^^/was there before all (...). And never a church
had any church of (...) yet / but yt ^as (...) by (...) ^^^rch to their handys
(...) that yt is (...) that no^e of all them can be (...) church / but
Crystys church (...) ^^dys be that church y^ was before them all / and out
of which all they have s^rongen / and synnys seueryd they^^ self / which is
the church y^ all they deny not / to believe against them / the poyntys which
we believe and they reprove.

The.iii chapyter.
The messenger moves that ye very church peradventure is not the p^^ple y^ we
take for it / but a secret unknown sort of such only / as be by god
predestynate to be saved. Where unto the author answers and declares that yt
can not be so.

Peradventure q he there might be said / that it needs not to a^sygne any
place where the very church and true christian congregation is. But sithe every
place is indyfferent there unto / yt may be that all the good men and chosen
people of god that ^e predestynate to be saved / in what perte so ever they be

there two / that these be the very chirch of Christ. And be in this world
vn^^^^^^ as yet while the church does (...) w^nder in y^ pilgrimage of this
short life. Mary q I this gere grows (...) worse to worse. And in very deed

as euydently se therwyth that the church which is y^ very church in deed /

the people that be known for the church. And go seek a another they neither
know what nor where / bylde up in the ^yre ^ church all so spyrytuall that
they leave therein at length neither god nor good man. And first where they say
that there be none therein but they that be predestynate to be saved / if the
questyon were of the church tryumph^unt in heuyn / th^n said they well. But we
sp^^^ of ye church of Christ (...) h^rein (...). And therefore goth their (...)
fa^ wide fro y^ place they should ^^^yt (...)/as heui^ and earth stand a
sonder. For first would. I wit if the church be none but those that be
prede^^ynate / whyther all that ^en predestynate be members thereof. Why not q
he. Than quod I he that (...) predestynate to be s^ued / whyther may h^ or not
be dy^^^^ times a sinner in his days. What if he may q he? May he not quod I
be also diverse times in his days in a wrong believe and a false heresy / and
after turn / (...)/and amend / and so be saved at (...) god ha^^
predestynate him to be^ What the q (...)^ Mary quod I for th^n shall yt follow
that he shall be a member of the very church and so still co^ty^^e and never
can be cast out being a s^a^ke heretyque. Yet quod he is he all that while a
quycke member of the church / by reason of goddys pre^^stynacyon / (...)
though he be not sure / yet yt is in deed sure that he is and ever shall be one
of the very church. It is quod I sure in deed and well know that he so shall
be. But as sure is yt that for the while he is not except / that all thing that
ever shall be is all ready present in deed as yt is present to goddys knowledge.
and the^ were saint Poule as good while he was a persecutour as when he was
apostle. And as verily a membre of Crystys church or he was borne / as he is
now in heui^. Well q he though that peradventure all those that be living and
predestynate to be saved be not in yt / yet may yt be yt there be none other in
yt then predestynates. But yt may be quod I that as men be chau^geable / he
that is predestynate may be many times in his life naught. And he that will at
last fall to sin and wrechednes and so finally cast him self away / shall
in some time of his life be good / and therefore for the time in goddys fau^^re.
For god^ blames nor hates no man for yt he shall will / but for that malycyous
will that he has or has had al ready. And thus shall thereby this reason be good
men out of Crystys church and nowghty men therein / faithful men out of yt and
heretyques in yt / and both ye tone and ye the other without reason or good cawse
why.

The.iiii. chapter.
The messenger month yt though the church be not ye nombre of folk only
predestynate to blys^/yet may yt peradventure be ye nombre of good and well
byleuynge folk here and there unknown / which may be peradventure those whom
we conde^^^^ for heretyques for holdyng opinion against ymagys. whereof the
author proves the contrary.

WEll quod he yet may yt be / yt the very church of Christ / is all such as
bileue a right and live well where so ever they be / though ye world know them
not / and though few of them know each other. For god as saint Poule says /
know who be his. And Christ says / y^ against his church y^ gatys of hell shall
not preuayll / but the gates of hell do preuayll against siners. And therefore
yt appears well that there can be no sinners in his church / nor that there be
none of his church but good folk. And unto them our lord is present and
keeps them from errors / and gives them right understanding of his holy
scryptures. And where they be forces not / how few they be to gether makes
no matter. For our savior says / where soever be two or three gathered to gether
i^ my name / there am I also among them. And so is his very church here and
there of only good men to the world unknown / and to him self well known.
And though they be few in comparyson / yet make they about in all the world a
good meyny among them. As god said when ye children of Israel were fallen to
ydolatrye and worshypped ye ydoll Baall so ferforth that yt seemed all were in
the case / and me^ knew not who where otherwise / yet said our lord as
appears in the.xix. chapyter the third book of ye kyngys / I shall reserve for
my self.vii. M. yt have not bended their kne before Baall. So y^ where ye
synagoge and church was tha^ / yt was unknown to man but yt was well known to
god. And they were not his church that seemed to be / but a company ungathered
that no man was ware of / nor would have went. And so may yt be peradventure
now / that the very church of Christ is not nor many. days has not ben the
people that seems to be the church / but some good me^ scatered here and
there unknown / till god gather them to gether and make them known / and
happily those that believe against ymagys and whom we now call heretyques. This
is q I a reason that Luther makes him self. By which he would bring the very
church of Christ out of knowledge / and would put yt in dowt whyther ye saints
that the church honors / were good men or not. And would that yt might seem
peradventure nay / but that they were happily not good. But the good men and
sayntys in deed / were some other whom the world for their open lewd living
reputed for naught. But where he says that the church or synagoge of the right
believe was than unknown / that is not true. For yt was well known in
Jerusalem and Judea / though yt had been unknown who were faithful in
Samaria. And the scripture also says not that these.vii. M. whom he would l^ue
yet in Israel that had not bowed their knees before Baall / were secret and
unknown / but he says only that such a number of such folk he would leave.
But now for our purpose sithe ye will have the very church a secret unknown
not company and congregacyo^ / but a dysper^led no^bre of only good me^ / will
you that those good men which after your reckoning make the very church / shall
have the same faith and none other than we have / which be now reputed for the
church / or else a faith and bylyef dyfferent? What if they h^^^ ye same q he?
Mary quod I (...) will your new by^lded church (...) thing help your
purpose. But they shall (...) fa^^e conferme the worship of images / p^^y^ng to
sayntys / and s^kyng to pylgrymagys as we. And as depely condemn for heresy
your opinion to the contrary. That is very ^^outh q h^. But yt may be that of
that very church yt faith and bylyef shall be / that all this gere is erronyou^^
and as plain ydolatry as was ye worshyppyng of Baal. if that were so q I than
had Christ not keep him.vii. M. from ye worship of Baall in all the regyons that
bear the name of crystendome / except these new folk of Saxony and Bohem which
your self gr^^^^t^ to be the herety^^s as sectys co^^^ out of the church. And
more than word^e were yt / if all the church of Christ should be clean (...)
infydelys and heretyques and no p^^^^ at all thereof among the great
unchangeable ^rysten countre^s / which (...) kept their faith in one constant
^^^^hy^^ deryued i^to the beginning. For this am I sure / that in all those
regy^^ as I say / if any have any such opinion against ymagys and sayntys /
yet comes he to ye church among his neighbors / and there boweth his knees
to Baall if the ymagys be Baall as his neighbors do. But go to let us forth on
a little ferther. And supposyng that there were some such secret good folk as
yt speak of that had ye right bylefe and were the right church / and that they
were so dyspersed a sondre yt they were to the world unknown / has not god
set an order in his church that some shall preche to the remenaunt for
exortacyon of good living and inform^cyon wherein good living stands / as
in faith and good workys. Yes quod he. Had not Christ quod I sact^ m^te^al^ to
be mynistred i^ his church by the preestys of ye same? Yes quod he. Now quod I
if some infydelys as Turkys or S^^ysens having herd of Crystys name / did long
to know his scripture and his faith / and heri^g that there were many people
that professed them self for christian me^ / hole nations but they were al open
ydolatres and in a mysbylefe / and clearly deceived and begyled / and that
specially by ye clergy yt techeth them / how be yt there were yet a few good
folk and right byleuynge which were not deceived / which among them be the
very true church / but who they be / or where they be / or how to ask for
the^ / or if he happen on them / yet where by to know them that can no man
tell him / how should these infydelys come to the faith / and of whom should
they here yt. For they being warned before yt there were many s^ctys of
heretyques and but one true church / would never be so mad to learn of them
yt they might wene were wrong. And how should they now come to the right when
the true church is unknown? They might q he take ye scripture. They should quod
I be therein like to Enuchus that could not understand without a reder. And
tha^ if they took a wrong reder of a wrong church / all were ma^^ed. And also
they would not trust the scryptures nor reke^ that they had the right books of
scripture among false sectys / but would look to receive ye true scripture of
ye right and true church. And thus here yt appears if it (...) th^^/god had
left none ordyn^ry way for his gospel and faith to be t^ught. But let go
these infidelys and speak of our self which are (if this way were true) as
fals^ as they^ where be tha^ prechers of this very church that should preche
and teache us better? For yt is no church if yt have no prechours Yt has quod
he some that preche some time / but ye will not suffer them. Ye punysshe them
and burn the^. Nay quod I they be wyser tha^ so they ^yll not be burned for us
/ for they will rather swear on a book yt they never said so / or else that
they will no more say so. And in this appears that there is no such secret
unknown church of Christ / that having such opynyons is ye very church. For
ye very church has ever had some that has abyde^ by their faith and their
prechynge / and would never go back with goddys word to dye therefore. And this
church that we be of / that take your church for heretyques have had many such
martryris therein / ye byleued as we do against your opynyons / as appears by
the hystoryes and by many of their books / where as of your secret church I
never yet found or herd of any one in all my life / but he would forswere
your faith to save his life. Where be also you preestys and your bishops? For
such must they have if they be the church of Christ. Now such can your church
have none / ye be each to other unknown And though some of such chyrches have
a false opynyo^ that every man is a priest / and every woman to / yet this
heresye false as it is will not serve this unknown church. For ye holders of
that opinion do put / that no man may for all that take upon him to preche or
meddle as priest / till he be chosen by the congregacyon. And where can that be
^t this y^^gynary church / of which n^ man know^^h other? And where as our lord
says / where soeu^r ^e two or three gathered to gether in my name there am I with
them / he spa^e not as thoug^ every two or three what so ever they were should
make his church / but that where so ever there came ^o gether two or three in
his name that be of his church there is he with them. And s^ does the one
t^xte of the s^ryp^^r^ in ye gospel plainly declare / as yt is well set out
and open^d by the holy doctor and glorious martyr saint Cypryan / in his
epistle against No^^cya^. wha^ our savior says also that he which w^lde not
amend by his fawte showed him before two or (...) wytnes / should be
c^mplayn^d vpp^n unto the church / did he means secret chyrch^ whyc^^ no man
wist where to fynde^ Now when the apostle writes unto the Corynthyens / t^^t
rather tha^ they should ple^t^ and strive in the law before the i^^ydelys /
they should set such as were in the church little set by / to be judges in
their tempo^^ll suytes / of what ^hyrch did he spe^^/of such one as no man
wist where to seek yt? This unknown church which they be dreuen to seek that
be loathe to ^nowe the church / will n^uer serve. But ye church of Christ is a
church well known. And his pleasure was to h^^e yt known and not hyd. And yt
is bylded upon so high an ^yll of ye holy st^ne / I ^^ane upon Christ him self /
that yt can not be hyd. No^ potest absconde c^^^tas supr^ supra m^nte^
posit^/The cite can not be hyd that is set^e on ^n hill. And he would have his
faith dy^ulged and spredde ^brode openly / not alway^ whispered i^ hukermoker.
And therefore he bound his pre^hours to stand thereby and not to revoke his word
for no pain. For he said yt he did not light ye candel to put yt and hyde yt
under a busshel / for so would no man do / but he had ki^deld a fire which he
would not should lie and smolder as coals does in que^che / but he would yt should
burn and give light. And therefore folly were it to say ye Christ which would have
his chirch spread through ye world / and every where gathered i^ company / would
have yt turned to a secret vn^nowe^ single sort seue^ed a so^der and scatered
about i^ corners unknown to all ye world and to the^ self to. Now where they
say yt there is none of ye church but only those yt be good folk / this would
make ye church clearly unknown were the people never so many and ye pla^e never
so large. For who ca^ know of ye multitude who be good i^ deed and who be
naught / sith yt b^d may suddenly be me^ded unware to ye world / ^ ye good as
suddenly waxe^ wors. Now lay they for ye proof of ye opynio^ / ye words of
Crist / which luther allegeth also for ye same e^te^t i^ his book yt he made
against Ambrosi^s Catherina / yt is to wit the words wherein our lord said unto
saint Peter / yt against his church gates of hell should not puayle/by which
w^^des Luther does (as he thi^keth and says hi^ self) marvelous gayly prove /
yt th^^^ ca^ be no man of ye church but he yt (...). For (...) h^th so many
folyes and fautes theri^ / and so much i^co^uenye^ce and absurdyte folowi^g
thervppo^ / yt it is more tha^ meruayl yt ^ child of one w^^es study i^
sophistry (...) for shame find i^ his heart to bri^ge it in place for any ernest
argument. For first if me^ deny him yt ye gates of hell do in ye place sygnyfy
yt devil then he ca^ never prove it / and tha^ is al his reason wyped quyte
away. Now do there in deed dyu^rs old ^me^tors and doctors of ye chirch take
i^ yt place for ye gates of hell / ye gr^t^ tyrau^tes and heretyques / by whose
persecucions and heresies as yt were by two gatys / many a man has gone in to
hell. And our savior promyseth i^ ye place / yt neither of those two gates /
yt is to wit neither paynym tyrau^t nor crystened heretyque / should puayl
against ye chirch^ For though they have dystr^yed and sh^l d^stroy many of ye
church / yet shall they not be able to distroy ye chirch / but the chirch sh^l
stand and be by god pserued i^ d^spit of all their teth. And thus ye se how
son^ Luthers special arg^me^t were o^^rthrowe^ with troth. But if a man would
grant hi^ yt ye gates of h^l did here sygnify ye devil / ye sh^ld we not need
to grant hi^ yt ye de^^^ as he is called of go^ (...) of ye pope / ergo they
be not ye church / ^his argument proves yt there is i^ earth no ^^yrch ^t all.
For what church (...) he find or ymagyn in earth that does n^^ sin / and
specially if yt were true yt him self says among his other heresies / where
he holds sty^^y yt all the good wor^es of good me^ be si^nes / and yt me^
si^ne i^ yt they do good? And thus he would both ^^ue^ ye church to be only a
secret vnkn^we^ sort of folk yt do not sin / and yet he ^o^fesseth yt there
be none such. And so as he go^th about to take away the very c^yrch yt is well
known / making as though he would find out a better / he leueth i^ co^clusyo^
no church at all. And to such a fo^de and false end must they needs being yt
al / yt will make yt a number of only such as be good me^^ do not sin. For if
he should be in yt always wha^ he i^ out of sin / and out of yt wha^ he is in
sin / tha^ should a man peradventure be in yt i^ ye morni^ge and out of yt at
none / and in again at night. So yt who were i^ yt / or wha^ / or where yt were
/ who could (...) out of gods f^uour Christ him ^elf said to his apostles /
now be you clean but not all / and yet were they al of his church Albe yt yt
one of the^ was as our s^uyor said him self / a devil. Did I not ^^yd he ^hese
twelf of you / and one of you is a devil? And if there were none of the chirch
but good me^ as long as they were good / tha^ had saint Peter be^ ones no perte
of ye church after ye Christ had appoi^ted him for chyef. But our lord in this
his mystycall body of his church / caryeth his me^bres / some se^e / some hole /
and all sekely. Nor they be not for every sin clean cast of from ye body /
but if they be for fe^^ of i^fe^cio^ cut of / or else wylli^gly do depart and
s^perate the^ self as do these heretics / yt ^yther refuse ye church wylfully
the^ self / or else for their obstinacy be put out. F^^ till their ^^uburne
h^rtes do show the^ i^curable / ye body bears the^ yet about ^yke and noughty
and ca^ cold as they be / to prove whith^r ye warmne^^e of grace going th^rowe
this hol^ my^^ycall body of Crystys church might get yet and (...) su^ life in
the^. But wha^ ye time shall come yt this (...) plesaunt /some p^ynfull / to
cure her.

The.v. chapyter.
The author shows and concludes that this comen known multitude of cry^^^^
nacyo^s not cut of nor fallen of by heresy^s / be the very church of Christ good
men and bad together.

ANd finally to put out of question which is Crystes very church ^yth yt is
agr^ed between us and grau^t^d through crys^endom / and a conclusyo^ very true /
yt by the church we know ye scripture / which church is yt by which ye know
^he scripture? It is not this company and congregacyon / of all these nacyons /
that without faccions taken and precysyon from the remenaunt / pro^es^e ye name
and faith of Christ? By this church know w^ the scripture / and this is the very
church / and thy^ has ^^go^ at Christ and has had him for their heed and saint
Peter his vycar after him and heed under him / and always synnys the succes^ours
of him contynually / and have h^d his holy faith and his blyssed sacrame^tys
and his holy scryptures delivered / kep^ and co^serued therein by god and his
holy spyryte. And all be yt some nacyo^s fall away / yet like wise as how many
bowys so ever fall from ye tree / though they fall more than be left thereon /
yet they make no dowte which is ye very tree / all though each of them were
planted again in a another place and grew to a gretter tha^ ye stock he came
first of / right so while we se and well know / yt all ye co^panyes and sectys
of heretyques and scysmatyques how great soever they grow came out of this
chirch yt I spak of / we know evermore yt ye heretics be they yt be severed /
and ye chirch ye stock that all they came out of. And sith that only the
church of Christ is ye vine that Christ spoke of in ye gospel / which he takes
for, his body mystycall / and that every branch severed from ye tree leseth
his lively nouryshi^g / we must nedys well know yt all these branches of
heretyques fallen from the church the vine of Crystys mystycall body / seem
they never so fresshe and gr^ne / be yet in deed but wytherlynges that wyther
and shall dry up / able to seru^ for nothing but for the fire.

The.vi. chapyter.
The mes^enger moves / y^ sith the church is this known multitude of good
men and badde to gether / of who^ no man knows which be the tone sort and
which be the the other / yt yt may be peradueutnre yt the good sort of the church
be they that believe ye wor^hyp of images to be ydolatry / and the bad sort they
yt believe y^ contrary. Which obieccyon the author does ans^^re and confute.

When I had said. Sir q he ye have in good faithfully satysfyed me concerning
y^ sure and vn^^wted knowledge of ye very church here i^ earth. But yet thinks
me ye one little dowt remains for our pryncypall matter. What is y^ q I. Mary
^yr q he yt is this / yt though the very faith be in the church / and the
church can not err therein / nor ye church ca^ not be deceived against ye faith
in any text of scryptur / nor no scripture is there yt being well understood
does or ca^ do stand against ye faith of ye church / and yt also the church is
none other but as ye say and as I se yt is in deed / but this hole comen
congregacyo^ of trysten people good and badde / not seperatynge them self fro
frowardnes / nor being put ^^t for their obstynate fawtes / yet sith yt
appears well that though the right faith be in ye church / yt is not in every
man of the church. And though ye church can not err in such things / yet some
of ye church may. Now s^meth yt to some men that yt may well peradventure
happen / that the good men well beleuyng and vndeceyued / be those that believe
the worship of images and prayng to saints to be ydolatry. And on ye the other
side / that those whythe believe ye contrary be that part of ye church that be
the naughty me^ / mysbyleuers and foul deceived. That were a very straung
work quod I. ye would right now quod I / that in ye church we should ^hynk that
there were none other but good me^. Will ye now agree that there be therein some
good men? ye quod be that must needs be. Well quod I why there be they good men
that do naught? Nay quod he. Do they well q I that do ydolatry in deed though
yt be against their hearts. Nay quod he. But all quod I come to church and
worship ymagys / and all pray to saints. Wherefore if that be ydolatry / then
ye church of Christ is all naught. For thus do they that be of ye contrary side
/ for fere of being perceived. Also if one do well or preche well is ^^ a good
man if he deny yt for fere? Nay quod he. But now q I all y^ are of that sort
if they happen to adventure so^what and be spyed / they will first periure the^
self / and after abjure their opinion so yt if their opynyo^ were good / yet
were the^ self naught. But yet q he if their opynyons be good / than be not
they so evil in hydi^g their ente^tys for fere / as they that against their
true opynio^s do and preche openly and p^rsue them ^or sayng troth. As some
that faynted and fled fromartyrdome / were not so evil as they that pursued
them. Uery troth quod I if these mennys opynyos were true. But yet though they
were true / yet were these me^ naught. And ye the other worse quod he. That is
well said quod I. But they and the the other be ye hole church. And if yours be
naught as ye grant and must needs grant they be / if ye the other were naught to
/ tha^ were in the church ^one good But your self deny not but in ye church yt
must needs be / yt there be some good. And there can be none but either your
part or ye the other. Ergo sithe yours be naught those yt be good must needs be
ye the other. But none of those yt be of ye the other could be good me^ if they were
ydolaters and persued your part for saying ye troth / and compelled the^ to
deny ye troth / ergo ye the other perte be not ydolaters / nor ye opynyo^ of your
perte for which they pursue your perte be not true. And thus it appears as me
seem / that good me^ of ye church be against you / and the noughty with you.

The.vii. chapyter.
ye author so^what does corroborat ye tr^uch against ye heresies holding
against images / and ^ecapy^elyng some what brefly what has be^ proved / so
fynessheth and e^deth ye proof for his perte.

ANd yet speak I nothing of all ye good me^ / and well ^nowe^ for good me^ /
and holy me^ / and now saints in heaven / yt have condemned your part and
written against you. And your part therefore be so sore against (...)
agay^^/because they se their h^resyes i^p^gned and condemned by their holy
wryteiges. Nor be^^des this have I nothing spoken of ye general cou^saylys
co^de^pni^g your perte by good and substa^cyall authoryte / co^probate and
corroborate by the hole body of cryste^dom / led there unto both long before
and ever synnys / through the s^crete operacyon of the holy ghost / Who could
never suffer (as your self agrees) ye church of Christ to continue so hole and
so long in so damnable ydolatrye as this were if yt were superstycyon and not
a part of very faith and true devout relygyon. Wherefore sith I have proved
you that the church can not err in so great a point / nor against the right
faith mystake the sentence of holy scripture / and also yt these people that
believe images to be worshypped be ye very church of Christ / and that of his
church the good and badde both does use yt / and the good me^ does yt trewly
/ and the bad falsely / and that all the good men of old has allowed and used
this way and condemned the contrary / which has also ben declared for false
heresy by hole y^ general co^sayle of crystendom / approved by the faith and
custom of all the people beside growi^g in to such consent by goddis holy
spyryte that governs his church / I never need to go f^^ther or touch your
textys or argumentys to the contrary. For this side thus proved good / yt must
nedys follow that the the other side is naught / except ye have against this any
ferther thing to say. Which if ye have never let to bring it forth. For I will
for none haste leave any corne^ of the matter vn^ansaked / as far as we can any
dowt find there in. In good faith sir quod he I am in this matter even at the
hard wall / and se not how to go ferther. Now I as^ure you q I if I cowlde my
self ^ynde any ferther obiec^yo^ / I would not ^ayle to bring yt in^ But in
good faith I suppose we be waded in this matter as far as we ca^ both find.
And I am sure as far as ever Luther found or any yt ever I have seen y^ any
thing have said or written on that side.

The.viii. chapyter.
The author enters the answer to ye obieccyons that had been before laid by
the messenger / against the worship of ymagys / and prayng to sayntys / and
going on pylgrymagys. And first he answers in this chapter thobieccyo^s
made against praynge to sayntys.

NOw therefore as I say ferther need I not to go. But yet will I somewhat touch
y^ things which as ye say do move many me^ to take ye worship of images for
ydolatry. And yt so taken and their opynyo^ so reputed / they teken yt a
ground to think ye miracles done at ye ymagys / or by (...) of sayntys to be
yllusyo^s of ye d^uyl. And first will we begy^ at ye sayntys them self. And by
ye way shall we speak of their relyques ymagys and pylgrymages as there shall
occasion ry^e in our matter. And for ye first in good faith saving that ye
books and writi^ges of holy doetors co^dempne these me^nys heresies / y^
dyspleasure and anger whereof sets them on a fire to ^^udy for ye mynyshynge
of their estymacyo^ that so stand in their light / else would I myth wo^tet
what these here ty^^ts met to impugn the worship of saints and forbed us to
pray to them. And all (...) here us. And if they do / yet whyther they can
help us. And finally if they could / yet would they we should think yt soly to
dysyre them because god ca^ do yt better and will do yt ^ouer him self than
they all. Now where they dowt whyther sayntys here us / I metuayle whereof that
dowt aryseth / but if they think them deed as well in soul as body. For if
their holy sowles live / there will no wise man wene them ^^urse and of less
love and charity to men that need their help when they be now in heaven / than
they had when they were here in earth. For all that while were they never so
good / yet the best was worse tha^ the worst is now. As our sauyoure said by
saint John^ ye baptyste / that there was no woman's sone gretter than be / yet
the lest that was al ready in heuyn was his better. We se that the nerer that
folk draw thytherwa^d / ye more good mind bear they to men here. And
therefore sayn^ Stephen when he saw heuyn open for him / he began to pray for
them ye malycyously killed him. And think we than that being in heuyn he will
not vou^hesaufe to pray for them that devoutly honor him / but has less
love and charity ^eyng there / than he had going thy therward? if the tyche man
that lay in hell had yet not only for fears of encreace of his own
punishment by his mothers damynacyo^ growyng of his evil ensample insy^ne /
but also of a c^^nall love and (...) of blyssed charity in heaven/will no thing
care for their brethren in Christ whom they se here in this wreched world? Now
if there be no dout as I trow none theris / but their holy souls be alive /
they would we did well. And as little dowte but that they bealyue if god be their
god / as he is in deed / and he not the god of deed men but of living / as our
savior says in the gospel / for all men live still and ever shall / that he
has taken to him ^nys given live unto / there rest^th tha^ no ferther tose but
whyther they can do us any good or no / either for yt they ca^ not here us / or
for that they ca^ not help us. and first I me^uayl much if they think they ca^
not help us. For while they were tere they could as appears in thactys of
^hapostles. And sith imbe^yllyte and lack of power is here part of our mysery
/ and strength of plentye of power is one great parts of welthe / they were
well forthered in that point if they were now less able to do good to them
whom they said would were helped / tha^ they were before. For whyther they be
able there to do yt them self / or only by their intercessyon made unto god /
this makes no forse for our matter / so that by their means y^ tone ways or
the the other we take help by our devotion toward them and prayer made unto
them. I think q be they may do in deed mythe more than they might both by
power and prayer. But yt is hard somewhat to think / that they should he^e us
and se us / and specially in so many placys at onys. For though they be not
cyrcumscrybed in place for lac^e of bodyly dymensyo^ and men^^ryng / yet are
they and (...) so placed where they be for the time / that they be not at one
time in diverse placys at onys as sayntys be in sundry co^ntryes / and very
far asu^dre called upon at onys. Ye marvel quod I and thyn^e yt hard to
be byleued / that sayntys here us. And I while we se that ye things we pray
for we obtayn / meruayl much more how men can dowt whyther the prayers be hard
or not. Wha^ s^yntys were in this world at lyberte and might wal^yd the world
about / wene we yt in heaven they stand tied to a p^ste? But the wonder is how
they may se and here in sundry placys at onys. If (...) two could no more but
feel and neither se nor here / we would as well wondre. Or if we could not
wondre thereof by cause we co^lde not here thereof / yet should we be far from
any co^ceyuyng in our mind / that it were (...) for man to se or here ferther
th^^ he can feel. For we that prove yt and d^ se and here in deed / can not yet
se the cause / nor in no wise cea^^ to wondre by what reason and mean yt may
be / that I sh^lde se tw^ chyrches or two towns each of th^^ two ^ mile a
sonder / and both twain as far fr^me as each of them ^com^ other / and
measure so great qu^^tytyes with so small a me^sur^ as is the little apple of
mine eye. And of h^ryng many me^nys voycis or any ^^^nys w^^des / ^o^ing at onys
in to ma^^ me^ny^^rys ^^andyng far a s^^der / h^^h ly^^ di^^yculte to co^ceyue.
And when all the reas^ns be made either of ^emys s^^t out from ^ur eyes to the
things that w^ behold / or the figure of ye thyngis seen / ^^^typlyed in the
air from ye thyng^ to our eye / or of the ^yre ^^ryke^ with ye breath of ye
speker / and ^qually ^^lly^^^ forth in ^undels to the ears of the herers /
when all the reasons be herd / yet shall we rather delight to search than be
able to find any thing in these matters yt were able to make us perceive yt.
Now when we may with our flesshly eye and ere in this grace b^dy se and here
thyngys far dystau^t from us and from sundry placys far dystaunt a sonder /
meruayll we so much that blyssed angels and holy souls / being mere spyrytual
subst^uncys / vncharged of all bourdyn^us flessh^ and bonys / may in doing the
same as far p^sse and excede us and our powers natural / as ye lively soul
self excedeth our deedly body / nor can not believe they here us though we
find they help us / but if we perceived by what m^^nes they do yt / as
whyther they se and here us coming hither to us / or our voice comi^g hens^ to
them / or whyther god here and se all and show yt them / or whyther they
b^h^ld yt in him as one does in a book the thing that he redeth / or whyther
god by some other way does utter yt unto them as one does in spekyng /
except w^ may know the means we will not else believe the m^^er? As wise as
were ^e that would not believe ^^ can se / bycawse he can not perceive by what
(...) he may se. Yet se I qu^d he no cause or need why we should pray (...)
them / sith god can as well and will as gladly b^th here us and help (...) as
any saint in heaven. What need y^^ quod I to pray any physycyon to help your
fever / or pray and ^^ay any s^^geon to h^le your s^re leg / sith god can
here you and help you both as well as the best / and loves you better and can
do yt sooner / and may aforthe (...) pl^sher ^h^tter chepe / and give you more
for your word tha^ they for your money? But this is his pleasur quod he that I
shall be helped by the mean of them as his instrumentys / though in deed all
this he does him selfe^ sith he gives the nature to the thyngys yt they do yt
with. So has yt quod I pleased god in like wise / that we shall ask help of
his holy saints / And pray for help to them. Nor that is not a making of
them equal unto god him self though they do yt by his will and power / or he at
their i^tercessio^. Though god will as reason is / be chyef and have no match
/ yet forbedeth he not one man to pray for help of a another. And though the
father has given all the Judgment to his sone / yet does he delight to have
his holy sayntis pertyne^s of that honor / and at the day of Judgment to have
them sit with him. Was Helyseus made egall to god because the wydowe prayed
him to reuyue her deed sone? Were the apostles egall to Christ because that
they were prayed unto for help after his deth^^ in his life also? And many
thyngy^ did they at fol^ys prayer: And some time they were prayed unto and
assayed yt also / and yet could not do yt / but the parties were feign to go
fro them to their master therefore. And yet was he content that they were
praye^ unto. And for proof thereof suffered theyin at mennys devout inst^unce and
prayer / to do many miracles. And somtym^ were they prayed to be i^tercess^^^s
to their master. As where they cam^ to Christ and said / Dimitte ^llam^^^^
^^amat post nos / dyspache this woman for she cries upon us. And thynk you
than that he being content and gy^yng men occasyon to pray to them (...) they
were with him in erthe^ he will be angry if we do them as much worship wha^
they be with him in heuyn? Nay / but I think on the the other side sith his
pleasure is to have his saints had in honor and prayed unto / that they may
be for us intecessours to his high mayestye / where unto ere we presume to
approach / yt becomes us and well behooves us to make frendys of such as he
has in favor. He will dysdayn / onys to look at us if we be so presumpt^^^se
and malapert fellows / that upon boldness of famyliaryte with him self / we
dysdayn to make our intercessours his especyall byloued frendis. And where
saint Poule exhorts us each to pray for other / and we be glad to think yt
well done to pray every poor man to pray for us / should we think yt evil
done to pray holy ^ayntes in heaven to the same? Why q he by that reason I might
pray not only to sai^tes / but also to every other deed man. So^ may ye quod I
with good reason / y^ ye se none other lykelyhed but that he ^yed a good man.
And so find we (as I remember) in the d^alogys of sayu^ Gregory / y^ one had
help by prayou^ made unto an holy man late de^eaced which was him self yet in
purgatory? So lyked yt our lord to let the world know that he was in his
special favor / though he were yet in pain of his p^rg^cyo^. For our lord
loved him never the (...)/though he left not for him ye order of his
m^^^yfull^ Justice. And therefore let no man take his trouble or ^y^^ne^^^ as a
t^^^^ o^ goddys hatered but if he f^l^ him sel^^ ^tudge and ^s impacye^t and
evil c^nce^^ with yt. For tha^ is ye ^ toke^ of wrath and venge^^^ce and (...)
to the ^^^^ere^ ^s frutfull as paynfull. And in effect noth^^g else but the
beginning of his hell even here. But on the the other side if he take yt
pacye^tly yt purges / if gladly yt greatly mereteth / and glad may he be that
is with m^kenes glad of goddys punys^^e^t. Saint Austyn as is written by
Pos^ydo^ius lyenge sure seek him self of an a^es / cured a ^other with his
prayour / and yet h^ dyed of his sykenesse him selfe^ where in there was to him
more mercy and favor showed / than if him self had been cured to. For now in
^ede of health he had heaven where he should never more be seek again. Mary quod
he but I have ever herd yt said that we should not pray to any deed man but
with this condycyo^ / if thou be a saint th^^ pray for me. Why so q I more tha^
prai^g to a quycke man / where I am not bound to say if thou be a good man pray
for (...). But sith I may resonably thy (...) him good while I know him not ye
contrary / so m^ye I think him that is deed. Why quod he whereof serves
canonysynge than. If this be true I am never auysed to be canoni^ed why^^ I
live. Ye do the better qu^d I / nor seven year after neither. For yt w^ld be
but a busynes for you. But why be they th^n canonysed than quod he? These quod
I that be not canonised / ye may for the more part both pray for them and pray
to them. As ye may for and to them that b^n yet alive. But one that is
canonysed ye may pray to him to pray for you / but ye may not for him. For as
I remember saint Austeyn says that he that prays for a martyr does ye
martyr i^^ury. And of every man ye may trust well and be seldom certain / but
of the canonysed ye may reken you sure.

The.ix. chapyter.
The messenger yet again obi^cteth against relics. And puts great dow^e
in canonysyng. Where unto the author makes answere^

HOw ca^ I quod he be sure therof^ May ye taking up of a ma^^^^ b^nes / and
setting his ca^tas in a g^^ (...)/and tha^ ^y^^ng his ^^re scalpe / make a man
a saint. And yet are there some vnsheyned / for no man woteth where they lie.
And some that me^ do^^ whyther ever they had any body at all or not. But ma^y to
recompense that (...) all there be some again that have two bodies / to lend
one to some good fellow th^^ la^^eth. For as I said before somone body lies hole
in two placys far a sonder / or else the mo^kys of ye to^^ b^ begyled. For
both ye placys plainly aff^rme that ye lies there. And at eyth^r place they
show the shryne. And in ye shryne they show a body which they say is the body
and boldly bide thereby that yt is yt / alledgyng old writing and myracle^ also
for ye proof. Now must w^ confe^^ that either the myra^^^^ at ^he ton^ place b^
false or done by the devil / or else that ye same saint had.ii. b^dyes in
deed. And tha^ were that in my mind as gre^e a miracle as the gretest of them
all. And therefore is yt lykely so^where a bone worshypped for a relyq^^ of some
holy saint / that was peradventure a bone as Chaucer says (...) also somethin
ye gospel to and ^^pro^e the ph^rysyes for making fullshe (...) sepulchre^ of
holy prophet (...) and making sh^^^^^ of their g^^ys. wh^r^by yt app^reth that
he would (...) worshypped and set in gay golden shrynes. And yet besydys this ye
shall find many mo worsh^pped I wene than shryned / many shryned that ye find
not canonysed / though ye s^ke up all ye regestres in Rome. And when they be
shryned and can^nysed to / yet sith the church in the ^^^ony^acyon use the
mean the (...) begyle them / for they stand to the record of men both of
their lives and of their miracles / which me^ may per^^uenture lie / why may yt
not than (...)/that the chyrch^ he deceived in the ^^nonysacyon. And that they
may for lack of true knowledge byleuynge untrue me^ / canonyse for sayntys
such folk sometime as be full far there from. I dare not say so much as
says saint Austyn. For he lets not to say plainly that many bodies be
w^^shypped for saints herein earth / whose souls ^e beryed in hell. Ye have
quod I said many thyngys very stoutly. But yet let us first consider where unto
al to gether wayeth. For yt stretches no ferther if yt were all true / but
that we might be deceived in some that we should take for say^tys. An^ yt
neither proves yt there be no sayntys / which I wot well no wise man will
say / nor that if any be they should not ^e worshypped nor prayed unto Except
ye would say that if we might by possybylyte mystake some / therefore we should
worship none. And than should you by that reason never take any physycyon /
sith ye might happen upon ^ dog leche for lack of knowledge of the connyng.
For in recordis of men ye might he as well deceived them / as h^re. Now suppose
than first th^^ of ^^yntes and of ^aly^^^^/some were true and some were false.
Yet the worship that y^ (...) would we should do to them all / should be because
(that standing as they do unknown and vndyscerned) ye re^ened them all true
and all for goddys well beloved servants. For if ye knew of them which were
true and whyth false / th^^ would ye worship the true / and trede ye false
under foot. That is no dowt q he. Th^^ q^od I if we were begyled in some^ I se
no great peril grow toward v^ thereby. For if there came a great meany of the
kyngys frendys into your co^^^trye / and ye for his sake made the y^^ all great
che^^. If there came among them unware to you some spies that were his
mortal enemies / werynge his badge and semyng to you and so report ^as his
famyly^^^frendes / wheather would he blame you ^or the good there ye made his
enemies or thank you for the good che^e ye made his f^^^ dys. He would I
think q he thank me for the good intreaty^ge of them both / sith does seemed
good to me / and both had of me their ^here but for they seemed hy^ frendys and
for his sake: Ye say q I good reason. But I put case now that ye had an
^^^^lynge or else a plain warnyng / that some of them were his enmyes that
seemed his best frendys / but which they were no man came tell you / what would
you now do / make them all chere and h^nourably entreat them all / or else
showing them that ye here say plainly that some of them be naught / there
fore did them be walking all with sorrow? Nay quod he no dowt we^e yt / but
that I should l^ke for thank if I cheryshed his enemies for his frendys /
rather then despytfully to handel his frendys^ or his enemies. Uery well quod
I. And this were true all though ye had warnyng that some of the^ w^r^ his
enmyes. But what thank would ye then deserve if ye should shake of both / where
ye had no such^ warning at all / but would say that ye durst not make any of
them chere / because ye thought that peradventure yt might b^ that some were
wors tha^ they were taken for? For in such case be you h^re / ye know not that
any man worshypped for a saint is none / but only ye think that ye be not sure
whether all be or some not. Yes quod ^e saint Austeyn as I told you gives me
warnyng / that many be none. Ye be q I deceived therein / as I shall tell you
after. But in ye mean whyl^ mark me well this / and let yt stand for a sure
ground / yt all your obiecyon if yt were true / serves not against
worshyppy^ge of sayntys or sayntys relyques / (...) the worshyppyng of such as
were no saint is (...) no sayntys rely^^es. And that (...) out examynacyon. For
surely ye wordabis; whereof they took ye occasyo^ which he writes i^ ye first
book de ciuitate dei / and repeteth again i^ his book of ye cure and care that
men should have for them that be deed / those words I say go far wide from
all such purpose. For there he speaks only of costely bury^nge / and making
of sumptuous sepulchers / and doing ye deed corpse of rich me^ worldly worship
in the caryenge for the and ent^erynge of the body / as ye plainly and
euydently appears by the matter yt he writes of. And surely sithe our lord
never w^ld among his chosen people give ye glory of his name to a another / nor
never so suffered ydolatry among the jews / but y^ either ^e forth with
punyss^^^ and pourged yt / or so (...) will have him honored and had for
hallowed in his church here in earth / and this thing either by them that has
y^ cure of his church after such dylyge^ce used / being by y^ canonysacyon
declared unto the people / or peradventure without canonysacyon grown there of
(by the holiness well known / and miracles many seen) so sure a common
persuasyon / through the hoole people of chrystendom yt the person is acceptyd
and reputyd for an undoubted saint / be the bonys tra^slatyd or not / his body
founden or not / al be yt by possybylyte of nature yt m^ught be that men were
in such thyngys deceived as ye have said / yet we boldyly may and well we
ought in this case / to trust yt the grace and aid of god and his holy spyryt
assystyng his church / has go^^^^yd the judgment of his mynysters / and
enclyned the myndys of his people to such consent. And yt he has not suffered
them to cure in a thing so nerely touching his honor and worship / either truly
to be applied where his will were yt should / upon him self or hy^ holy sayntys
for his (...)/or to be wythdr^wen the use and by erronyous mystakyng of troth
(...) mete and co^uenyent to be perceived of the church for gods honor
(which kind of troth god sent the holy ghost to teache his church) the same
worship to be bestowed upon them whom he would in no (...) have yt / but whom he
(...) nal shame. For the body (...) or not makes no doubt of the saint. No man
doubts of our lady. No man doubts of saint Johan theuangely^^ though their
bodies be not founden. And yet if they were / then were there I thynk no good
chrystyen man but he would be contented they were shrynyd and had in honor. For
where as ye would (...) be the reverence from all relyques because that some be
doubtful / in y^ some one sayntys head is as ye say and of some y^ hole body
showed at two sundry p^^cys / yt may fortu^e for all this that of one head there
may by sundry (...) and either part in the come^ speech of people called the
head. For at A mya^^^ saint Iohn^s head the baptist as me^ (...) yt in talkyng /
even they that have been there and seen yt. But then if they be asked further
question thereof / they ^ell that ye nether iowe lacheth. This may well happen
also and so does yt hap in deed / by some saint of whom in.ii. dyurtse
countrees be diverse shrynes / And there be rekened and reported yt its either
of them be laid the hole body and yt pilgrims at neither places do look in to
yt cofyn o^ ye s^iyne to se whether yt be all o^ pat^e. In some place
peradu^nture lay y^ body by and some occasyon yt body ^^an^lat^^ the (...) of
olde^ and yet the shryne showed still with some of the relyques ^^^^^ynynge
there in. yt may well happ^ also that ther^ were two good holy (...) in diverse
co^trees both of one name. And p^^^a^^ in some place may the^^ ^e some very
relyques unknown and ^ysu^^ed. For in old time (...) of infydelys did (...)
(...) never can begyle them. And that is ye assystence of god and ye holy
ghost. For else might the church be most easyly begyled in the receyuyng of
the very scypture / wherein they take outwardly but the testymonys of (...) from
mouth to mouth and hand to hand / without other examynacyo^. But ye secret
mean that enclyneth their credulyte to consent in the byleuyng all in one
point which is the secret instynete of god / this is the sure means that never
can in any necessary point fail here in Crystys church. For if yt might /
all were quyte at large. And that point onys taken a way / scripture and all
walks with yt. And in this mind as yt seemyth / was very sure and fastely
confermyd ye holy Appostle saint Poule / Which in his first epistle to the
Corynthyes writes in this wyse^ Obsecro vos fratres per nomen domini nostri
Jesus Cristi vt idipsum dicates omnes / et non ^nt in vobis scismata / sed sitis
integrum corpus eadem me^te et eadem sententia / I beseech you my brothren by
the name of our lord Ihu^ Christ / that you say all one thing / and let there be
no scysmes or several sects among you / but be ye one hole entier^ body of
one mind and one sentence. Troth is yt that he taught them and other the
right way so fersoth / that he boldly forbode an angel of heuyn to be byleuyd
/ if any would come and preche a another gospel. But yet in this place I note
myche / that he calls upon them only for agreement / bidding them only to
agree all upon one thing / and makyth no mencyon of agreement upon the best
and upon the troth / but only to avoid all dyscorde and dyuysyon and by comen
consent exho^^yth them to aggree all in one / meaning thereby as me thinks /
yt if the church of Christ e^^^^dyng well / do all agree upon any one thing
co^^ernyng gods honor or mannys so^^e / yt can not be but that thing must
needs be tr^^. For gods holy spyrit th^^ any^^teth his church and gives yt
life / will never suffer yt all consent and agree togeder upon any (...). And
therefore would he n^ue^ ^u^^er y^ church so fully to consent^ in the worship of
sayntys and reverence of relyques / if yt were a thing such as s^^m me^ would
have yt seem that is to wit a thing false and feigned. Wherein as myche as ye
lay to mynysshe (...) credence / that yt myght^ seem as yt say well enough
that some of the^ ^^re ^aynyd / yet wist I never prouyd that any such so taken
and by the church approved / was ever yet hitherto re^^^d / either here in
Crystys church or among the Jews in their synagoge before Crystys days / and
yet sayntys they had in honor as patryarches and prophets and their bodies
and relyques in reue^^^^. Now if of such as s^^yd good men we never had (...)
any for ypochrytys / albe yt yt might be that some were such / yet would we
not I think suppose that there were any so in deed / if we never had known yt
tried and prouyd so. And why shall we then of saints or relyq^^s (...) doubt
and mystrust? Of whom being receyue^ by the church for true / (...) never that
I could ^yt sin god wrought the world tried and prouyd any of both sortys
untrue / neyth^r as I say in the church of Christ no^ sy^^go^^ of the Jews /
which two sortys^^^ty ^ere gods chosen people. And yet (...) as well the
Jews as (...) I said in hon^^r / and their relyq^^^ in great (...)/as (...) as
well by the gospel as by the ^lde (...). Jacob that ^^^y patry^^rche
co^m^u^ded his children in (...) to ^ary his body to the ^eryall out of that
country of Egypt / and so they did. And I (...) also (...) that when they
should after de^^^rte out of Egypt / they should carry his b^nys with them.
The deed bonys of y^ prophet (...) as the bible ^en^y^neth ^^ysed a deed body
to life. And think you then that those bonys were not there honored for holy
relyques^ Nor our (...) Christ blames not the Iewys in the gospel for that
they garneshed the sepulcres of ye old prophetys / with whose honor he was
well content / but for yt they condemned them self in following the condycyon
of them that slewethe^ / ente^dyng to ^yll Christ as their forefathers did his
holy prophetys. For as for ye deed bodies of the holy prophetys that god would
(...) them had in honor and reverence he declared well by that he raised a
deed body by the (...) of y^ deed bonys of the prophets Heliseus as I said you
before. Did not (...) l^^d in the fyndyng of that holy relyque his holy cross
decl^^^ by miracle and make his own cross known from the crosses of the.ii.
thieves by the reysyng of a deed man with the touch thereof? Wherein is to be
notyd by the way / yt there was between his and theyres no notable dy^^erence /
but they nailed as he was / or else had yt be no doubt (...) vestures? And
doubt we then whether g^d w^lde we should worship them when he so well and
above nature ^^wordeth us for ye worship we do them

The.x. chapyter.
The messengre obiecteth many thyngys against pylgrymagis and relyques and
worshyppyng of saints / because of m^che superstycyous ma^^r used therein / and
vnlyefull petycyo^s asked of them / and harm growing thervppon.

S^r q he ye have in my m^nd very well touched ye matter / co^^^tnynge that yt
is not in vain to pray to sayntys nor to worship th^^^^ and to have their
relyques in some (...). But sir all this is far from the g^ete sore, for
though saint y^ may here us and h^lpe us to / and acr^ glad and wyllyn^e so
to do / and god also contented that they and their relyques and ymagys also be
had in honor / yes^ can neyth^r he nor they be content with the manner of
the worship, first taking away his own worship in that we do them the same
worship in every poynt^ that we do to god. And second^ly taking their
worship from them then also in that we do to their ymagys ye same yt we do to
the^self / taki^g their images for them self and so make not them self only
/ but also their ymagys fellows and matchys to god / wherwyth ^s I have said
^^fore / neither god nor good saint can nor good man ought to be content and
pleased. In faith quod I therein if yt so be ye say^ very true. What say we
than quod he of the harm yt gooth by going of pylgrymagys / roylynge about
in ydlenes / with the ropt / revelling / and ^y^awd^y / ^l^tony / wantonness /
waste / and le^hery? Crow ye that god and his holy sayntys had not lever they
sytte stylle at home then thus to come seek them with such worshypfull service?

Yes surely quod I. What say we then quod he to that I spoke not of yet / in
which we do them little worship while we set every saint to his office and
assygne him a craft such as pleases us. Saint Loy we m^ke an horsleche / and
must let our horse rather r^^ne v^^hodde and mar his hoo^e th^^ to shoe him
o^ his day. Which we must for that point more relygyously keep high and h^^y
then Este^ day. And bycawse one s^^t^ is to few at a forge / we set ^^ynt
^polytas to help him. And on saint St^uyn^ day we must le^ all our horses
blood with a k^yf^/bycawse sayn^ Stephen was killed with stones. Saint Appo^lyn
we make ^ tothe drawer / and may speak to her of no thing but of fore t^the.
Saint Sithe women set to seek their keys. Saint ^oke we set to se to the
great sekenes / bycawse he had a sore. And with him they ioyn^ saint Sebastyan
bycawse he was martyred with arrows. Some seem for the eye only. And some for a
sore breast. Saint ^^rmayn only for children. And yet will he not onys look at
them / but if the mother bryng^ with them a white l^fe and a po^ of good ^le.
And yet is he wyser the^ saint ^^ylge^orte / for she good soul is as they say
served and content with ^tys. Where of I can not perce^ne the reason / but if
yt be bycawse she sh^lde provide an horse for an evil husbonde to ^yde to the
devil vppon^ For that is the thing that she is so sought for as they s^ye In
so much that wom^n has therefore changed her name / and instead of saint
Wylgefor^^ call her saint Uncumber / bycawse they teken ye for a pek of otys
she will not fail to vncu^ber the^ of their husbo^des. Long work were yt to
rehearse you the dyust^e manner of many praty pylgrymagys / but one or two will I
tell you / The tone Pontanus spekyth of in his dyaloges / how saint Martyn is
worshypped. I have forgot ye town / but the manner I can not forget yt is so
strange. His image is on his day borne in proce^^o^ about all the streets. And
if yt be a fair day then use they as he comes by / to cast rose water and all
thyngys of plesaunt sauoure upon his image. But and it happen to ^ayne / out
pour they pyspottys upon his head / at every door and every wyndowe. ^s not
this a sweet service and a worshypfull worship? And this as I say Pontanus
writes and tells where yt is. But this that I shall now tell you / I dare
as boldly make you sure of / as if I had seen yt my self. At saint Wa^eryes
here in Pycat^y^ there is a fair abb^y where saint ^alerye was monk. And
upon afur^^ng^ of or two up in a wood is there a chapel / in which the saint
is specially sought unto for the stone / not only in those parties but also
out of Engl^nde. Now was there a young gentylm^n which had married a
marchauntys wife: And having a little wanto^ money which him thought brennyd
out the botom of his pursin the first year of his wedding / took his wise with
him and went over the sea for none other errande but to se Flaund^rs and
F^aunce and ^yde out one somer in those cou^tr^es. And having one in his
company that told by the way many strange thyngys of that pilgrimage / he
thought he would go somewhat out of his may either to se it if it were true / or
laugh at his man if he fo^^d yt false as he verily thought should have done in
deed. But wh^^ they (...) in to the chapel they found yt all true. And to
behold they found yt fonder then he had told. For lyk^ as in other
pylyrymagys ye se h^nged up leggys of wax or arms or such^ other partys / so
was in that chapel all their o^^ryngys that honge about the wallys / none
other things but mennys gere and women's gere m^de in wax. Then was there
besides this two round tyngys of sylu^^/the tone much larger then the the other.
Through which every man did put his preuy members at the ^^lters end. Not
every man through both / but some through the one and some through the the other.
For they were not both of a bygnes / but the one larger than the other. Then
was there yet a monk sta^dynge at the altar that hallowed certain thredys of
venyce gold. And them he delivered to the ^ylg^ymes / techynge the^ in what
wise them self or their frendys should use those thredys against ye stone. That
they shold^ knytte yt about their get^/and say I can not tell you what prayers.
An^ when the monk had declared the manner the gentylman had a serua^^^ that
was a married man and yet a m^^ry fel^we / and he thanking the monk for the
threde / desired him to ^^che him how he should kny^^e y^ about hi^ wy^es gere
^^hy^h except ye monk h^d some specyal craft in knyttynge h^ thought would be
^o^ (...) because her gere (...) so^what short. It need not to tell y^^ ye
every man laughed tha^ / save ye mo^k yt c^st (...) his tynges and his thredys
in a great anger and we^ this way^ was not ^hys^ Abide by god I had almost
fo^g^ten one thing that would not (...). As this gentylman and his wife were
knelynge in the chapel there came a good sad woman to him / showing him
that one the special point used in that pylyrymage and the su^est against the
^^ne / she wyste nere whether he were yet aduertysed of. Which if yt were done
she du^ste lay her life he should never have the stone in his life. And that
was she would have the length of his gere / and that should she make in a ware
candell / which should bren^e up in the chapel / and certain prayers should
there be said the while. And this was against the st^ne the very shote anchor.
When he had herd her (and he was one that in ernest fered the stone) he went
and asked his wife counsayll. But she like a good faithful cry^^^ts woman
loved no ^^the super^^ycyons. She could abide the reman^^^ne well enough. But
when she h^^de days of bren^ynge up the candell / she knytte the ^^^wes and
ernestly blys^^nge her. Beware in the virtue of god what ye do ^uod she. ^^^^e
up quod (...)? mary god forbede. ^t would w^^t up your ^^re upon poy^^ of my
life. I pray you beware of such wychecrafte. Is this kind of ^^y^s and
worship acceptable and plesaunt unto god and his sayntys? ^ow when people
worship ^^y^^ys in such wise that they make them belowes to god / and y^^gys
in such wise that they (...) the^ for the (...) self / and them again ^n the

dyspleasure / that the devil should have license and lyberty therefore to work
his won^ers in delusyon of our superstyryous ydoltry / then so to like and

manner of worshyppynge which we may well percyene al treason relygion and

The author answers all the obi^^cyons proponed by the messenger in the
tenthe chapyter. And some of th^y^ rowched by y^ messenger more at large in
other parts before.

YOur hole tale in e^^erte guod I re^teynyth three thyngys. One that the people
worship the sayntys and their ymagys also with ly^^ ho^^^^ as they d^ god him
self. ^ n^^^^ that they take the images for the r^^ngys self / which poyntys

For though (...) he^^ (...) (...) yet yt is (...) true that therefore they
worship them in every poi^t like unto god. What point lack they qu^d he. ^
M^^y the chy^f of all quod I That is y^ they worship god with y^ mind that he
is god / which mind in worship is the only thing that m^^^th yt latri^ and no
certain gesture (...) ^^^dyly obseruau^ce. Not and we would ^ollow upon the

but ye they know ^uy^ me^ from deed stones / and tree from ^essh and bone. And
when they ^f^r^^ as ye spoke of our lady at our pylgrymages before our lady at
a another / or one ^oode before a another / or make their i^^^c^cyons and vows
some to y^ t^^^ and s^^^ to the the other / I we^e yt esh^ to perceive that they
mean none other but that our lord and our lady / or our lord for our lady she
with mo miracles at the one then at the other. And that they intend in their
pilgrimage to up sit s^^^ of them one place and some another^ or partly
sometime as y^ place lies for them as their de^^^^ ledeth (...) and y^^ not
for the place / but for y^ ye ly^eth one lord by ^^nyfest, m^ (...) (...) live

we should with our bodies labor therefore / having o^r hertes all ye while in
heuyn. And wylled also yt we should as^e yt of him / without whose help our
labor will not serve. And th^rfore is our daily food one of ye petycy^^s of
the Pater noster / the prayour that him self taught his dyscyples. And ye horse
he set not so little by / but that rather the^ yt should peryssh / he rekenyd
yt no breche of ye ^^both day to pull him out of a pyt. And therefore in d^d^ me
seems the de^^cyon to r^nne somewhat to far / if ye smytth^^ will not for any

for the help of a poor ma^nys horse. But as for your teth^ I w^ne if they

had long called upon god and our lady and all the holy company of heuyn and
yet felt him self (...) the better / he began at last to call as ^a^^^ for
help unto the devil. And when his wife and his friends sore ab^sshed and
as^onyed rebuked him for calling on the devil which he wist w^ll was naught /
and if that he holp^ him yt should be for no good / he cried ow^e as loud as he
could again / (...)/all is good that helps. And ^od I wen^ would I qu^d he
^all (...) the devil and all rather than ab^^^ in ^^^ne. Nay quod I what (...)
ever yt say I can not think y^ would by^^^^ in the d^uyll as that Lu^b^rd did.
Ye would rather fare ly^e a no^h^^/that when the f^yer apposyd him in

For ^uyll yt is / and evil yt is suffered ye supers^ycyo^s manner of worship.
And as ^or that ye told of saint Martyn if yt be true / it has (...) excuse /
but that yt nothing towcheth our matter. For yt is not (...) worshyppynge but
dyspytynge and dysw^rshyppynge of sayntys. Towchynge the offrynge of bread and

/ though they yt ask the^ were as I tru^^ they be not a great people / they be

as ye say ye people d^ ydolatrye / in yt y^ say they take ye images for ye

The.xii. chapyter.
^

ANd we b^ very sure yt ye thing is good / and our way good th^rin / and ^^t
believe therein right / not only by reso^s and authoryte by which I have proved
it you more the^ onys all ready / but also by y^ all ye old holy saints and
doctors of Crystes chirch as saint Ier^^/saint Augustyn / saint Basyle / saint
Chrysostom / saint Gregory / with al such other as plainly we read in their
(...)/dy^ as we do therein / and byleued thereof as we believe. And sith we se
what they byleued / we need not to doubt what is be^^ yt we believe. For if any
se^te byleued (...) other / we be sure of ^he (...) ^er they / yt so well
bileued and lived there with / that god has accepted them for ^^yntys / and by
miracles openly declar^d that their faith and living lyked him. ^he^ (...) ^n
the the other side of such as byleued other wise ^s were these m^nyfold sectys of
obstynate heretyques / we se not one a saint am^ng them / nor one miracle
showed for the^. I wot ne^e quod he wheth^r this reason that ye make would
surely satysfy ye the other side or no. For men may peraduen^^re answer you that
there is many a glorious saint in heaven of whom we se no miracles in ert^/nor
happily never herd of their name. That may well be quod I / and I suppose yt
very true. May yt not also be quod he that though yt were h^rde to think /
but that of miracles some among so many must nedys be true / ^^t sith some
also may be feigned / may yt not be that those be^ feigned which de^ told to
(...) be done by them who^ ye rehersed^ them I mean that of old have wryte^
for your part / I mean, those whom y^ ^all the old doctors of the church /
and whom the church ta^^th for ^^^^tys. This quod I were worse then any thing
that we spoke of yet to fore. The worst was before / that we should pray to no
sayntys. And now ye would either that we should hau^ none / or a^ the least that
we should know none. Yes quod he ye may have sayntys and know for sayntys also
many one sith thapostles time / though those be none whose writing ye would
^^thoryse by their sa^ctyfyeng. The^ ^all you quod I to that point again / that
ye think yt may be that ye church may take for sayntys and worship as sayntys
them that been none. Surely quod he the pro^e that y^ have laid unto the
contrary though yt be somewhat probable / yet seems me not very strong nor
able and suffycyent to strain a m^n to consent thereto. For though ye
a^^y^^ence of god and his holy spyryt will not s^ffer his hole church to aggre
(...) to gyder in any dampn^ble err^^^^ yet may he suffer them well to err in
the knolege and worship of a saynt^ and mystake for a saint on yt were a
dampened wreche. For theri^ were no mo^^ danger to mannys soul / nor no more
honor taken from god / then when the people do worship an host vnconsecra^e
/ mystakyng yt through ye default of an evil pr^est for the sacred body of our
lord him self. And this y^ dowbte not but yt is sometime done. Forget not now
by the way quod I that ye still agree that god will not suffer his hole church
to agr^e in any dampnable error and fall in a false faith. And therwyth
remember that though yt were no dampnable error to take one for a saint yt
were none / or a bone for a relyque that were none / yet were yt a da^pnable
error to worship any if we should worship none at all. And therefore sith the
church byleueth that we should worship them / that kind of believe ca^ be none
error / but must n^dys be true: Nor ye kind of worship can be none ydolatry /
but must nedys be good and acc^ptable to god. And so our pryncypall matter
standing still sure and fast / We shall somewhat se forther whereto your wordys
will way and amount^. Y^ deny^ not quod I but there be some sayntys and some
miracles. No quod he. To what purpose quod I were miracles specially wrought by
god / was yt not ^o the intent to make his mes^^ng^rs known (...) (...) token
that the matter and substance of them is true. For else they were as lykely to
be spoken of in mo / sith of the false and lyeng sect is be so many. And the^
also miracles being true and being done but in one of all those many companyes
/ each calling him self ye church / yt is a good proof that the same one in
which only they be done / is only the very tr^w church of Christ to which
his holy spyryte and maruelouse m^ieste gives his special assyste^ce. And
surely of all miracles that ever god has wrought ^or his church / I se not in
my mind lyghly a more meruaylous / the^ that as many sectys of heretyques as
has spronge^ and parted out of Crystes church / and each of them laboryng to
be taken for the very church / yet has our lord hitherto never suffered
neither the devil to do any wonder for them that might have the color and
face of a miracle / nor as false as they be them self / yet has he not
suffered the^ hitherto not so much to do as fayn a miracle for their part.
Which is to my mind not only great wonder / but also their confessyd falshede
considered / a very clear proof yt they could never have been kept from yt but
by the especyall prouydence of god and his tender cure upon his chosen church
/ which yt has lyked him hither to / that miracles among other thyngys have been one good and sure mark between his church and all those erronyous sectys
that been sprongen owte thereof / and be not his church but would seem to be. For
as for Paynyms / turkys and sarasyns / which by open professyon a^ne of a
another flokke / and bear not the name of Christ nor look for him / he
suffers the devil some time to delude with wonders and meruaylys. But ye Jews
that still gape afte^ him / their miracles as far as I ca^ here be gone / to
the intent they may know yt he has left the^ and given the^ up / which was
wont to work all th^se wonders for them. Now as for heretyques which falsely
feign them self to be his own flokke / and presume to ^ere and profess his
name / he keeps the^ from the honor of any miracles doing / to the end that
the lack^ thereof among all their settys / and the doing thereof in his only
church / may be among many other thyngys one good mark and sure toke^ / where
by all the false sectys of them may be dyscerned and known from his very
true church / that is to say from ye hole congregacyon of true christian people in
this world / which without intermyxtyon of obstynate heresies / profess ye
right catholyque faith. Now is yt not only true that miracles be wrought only
in the church / and thereby do show which is the very church / but also they
do show that those holy doctors for who^ god has showed the^ / were good me^
and of the right bylyef. For if yt were as ye would of late have had yt seem /
that yt might peraduen^ be so yt ye holy doctors of our faith who^ we take for
sayntys / were in deed no sayntys nor sauyd souls / but happily those were
saved souls and saints in heuyn though yt were unknown here in erthe^ which
did teache the doctrine here that we now call heresies / then were yt a
wo^derous chaung that where as god among the Jews provided yt in every age
there were some god men by their good lyui^g and his high miracles so notable
and well known to ye peple^ that men had the^ always like bright ly^^ly stars
/ whose doctrine they might boldly believe / and whose living they might surely
follow / he would now in his special church of Christ / not only do nothing like
/ but also do clean ye contrary. For if he should take ye way that ye say / to
leave ever synnys thappostles days / all the true interpretours of his and
their holy writing and doctors of the very true ^aythe lie to the world
unknown / and the^ on ye the other side set forth with miracles or suffer so to
be set forth with meruayles / yt his chirch should take and accept for saites such
evil persons or ypocrytes as co^strued ye scripture wrong / and ever sin his
apostles days have taught falls errors / and led his flock out of ye right way
in a dye pathe to hell ward with wicked heresies and ydolatrye / then has not
god sent the holy ghost / and him self also tarried still therein / to teache his
church y^ troth as he said he would. But he had the^ helped to begyle the^ him
self / which were i^possible for god to do / and more tha^ blasph^my for any man
to think. For this were not like ye sufferaunce of an vnsecrat host / whereof
ye put ye sample / wherein the peoples inuyncyble ignorance with their devout
affeccyo^ may without harm to their souls be suffered in the thing that seldom
happeth and e^dureth for so short a while: But if god would leave all good
doctors unknown / and suffer his church to be deceived with miracles and
meruayles done by them that taught heresies and setforthe ydolatrye / then
should him self as I say not only suffer his honor and right faith and
relygyon to be perpetually l^st / but help also him self to destroy yt. Which
who so could think possible / were worse then Judas / and more mad then any
man in bedlem. And therefore can yt not in no wise be / that the church can be
deceived in that they take for sayntys these holy doctors of ye church. Nor
they so being / can yt in any wise be that the doctrine wherein they consent and
agree can be false or untrue? Among which doctrine sith the thyngys whereof we
speak / I mean the prayng to sayntys / the worship of ymagys / reuerencynge of
relyques / and going in pylgrymagys is a part as by their bokys plainly does
appear / we may well and surely conclude / that none of these thyngys be
dampnab^e or dyspleasaunt to god / but thyngys hyghly to his contentacyon and
pleasure. And sith we further perceive that their bokys be written in diverse
regyons and sundry ^gys / we thereby well perceive that these thyngys be
parcel of the rytes vsagys and believe of Crystys church / not only now and of
late / but contynually from the beginning hitherto. And sith yt is plainly
prouyd you that the church can in no wise be suffered of god to fall into any
dampnable error thereby / yt is yet most surely co^cludyd / that these thyngys
be none such. And consequentely prouyd / that no text of scripture semynge to
sown to the contrary / can be so taken or understood. Nor that the church
cannot in preiudyce of the faith mysse understand the scripture. And that the
substa^cyall poyntys of the faith therefore lernyd of the church / is one of
the surest rules that can be founden for the right interpretacyon of holy
scripture. And that no sect of heretyques can be the church of Christ / but
that once church is y^ very church. And yt is also clearly proved yt the matter
of miracles therein daily done / is neither feyned by men nor done by the devil
/ but only by y^ mighty hand of god. And such obieccyons as ye laid unto the
contrary of any point aforsayde / be as far as I can se suffycyently answered
/ except yt ye have any forther obieccyon to lay therein. Which if ye have ye
get no thank to spare. Whereunto he said and swear therwyth that he so fully
felt him self answered and co^te^ted therein / that he thought him self able
therwt to content and satysfye any man / that he should happen to mete with / yt
would hold the contrary. Whervppon for yt day we departed till a another time /
in which we appointed to pervse the remanaunt of the thyngys that he had in
the begyn^yng purposed.

The end of the second book
The third book,
The first chapyter.
The messenger having in ye mean while ben at the university / shows unto
the author an obieccyon which he lernyd there / against one point proved in the
first book / that is to wit that in ye necessary points of the faith / egall
credence is to be given to the church and to the scripture. Which obieccyon on
the author answers and dyssolueth.

ABout for tenyght after your friend came again in a morni^g new comen from y^
university / where he was as ye wot at lernyng ere he ca^ at you. And there
had he now as he said vysyted some of his old acquayntaunce. And upon
occasyon rysynge in co^munycacyon / had again repeted with some of them very
fresshe learned men / good part of our foremare dysceptacyon and reasonynge /
had between us before his departing. Which as he said they took great pleasure
in / and much wysshed to have be^ present there at. But surely he said that
some of the^ seemed to take very sore to heart / ye hard handelyng of ye man that
ye write of / and the burning of the new testament / and the forbedynge of
Luthers bokys to be read / which were as some of the^ thought / not all thing
so bad as they were made for. And finally touching the burning of heretyques /
there were some that thought the clergy therein far out of right order of
charity. I am q I very glad yt yt has been your hap to be ^here. Not so much
for any thing that ye have showed the^ of our co^munycacyo^ had all ready
concerning the prayng of sayntys / worshypyng of images and relyques / and
going in pilgrimage / wherein I think ye told them no newly / for I doubt
not but they cowlde have told you more of that matters them self than ye have
herd or could here of me / as for that I think that among them being as ye
say so well learned / ye h^^e either herd somewhat whereby ye be in some part of
these matters that we shall speak of all ^^dy ^a^y^fyed / whereby our busy^esse
^h^in may be the shorter / or else ye be the mo^^ ^trong^ly ^ted for the
the other part / whereby our dysputacyon shall be the fuller / and the matters the
more pl^^^ly (...)/for y^ more ample satysfaccyo^ of such as your self or your
master shall hereafter happen to find in any dowt of these thyngys that we
shall now towche and treat of^ In deed quod he somewhat have they showed me
their myndys therein / as in some part of the matters ye shall here when we hap
to come to them. That shall I gladly here quod I / and shape you such answer
as my pore wit will serve me. But yet I pray you be plain with me in one
thing. Were they satysfayed and held them self content in those thyngys that
were at last with myche work agreed between us? In good faith quod he to say
the truth / all were save one / and he in all thing save one. And to your
great praise and high co^mendacyon / they said that in these maters^ Nay q I
let their praise pass lest ye make me to proud. But I pray you tell me / not
which one myslyked one thing / but what one thing yt was / and why he myslyked
ye. Surely quod he for ought that I could bend upon him / he could never
agree that the faith of the church out of scripture / should be as s^re and
bind us to ye bylefe thereof / as ye wordys of holy scripture. Why quod I if ye
remembered well what we said / ye had enough to prove him yt. Troth is yt quod
he so had I and so did I / and in such wise that diverse ways I brought him
to the bay / yt he wist not how to void. But than said he to me yt he would
not do with me as I had don't with you. Nor yt was he said no wysdo^ for a man
against his aduersarye to use always the buckler hand. For so must all the
parell be his / and his adversary stand i^ surety. But on the the other side if he
use the sword therwyth and stryke among / and drive y^ the other to his defense
/ so may he hap to put him in half the parell. And like wise he said that if I
proved my perte so clearly to him that he could not say nay / yet if I would
again answer him another while / he might peradventure bring me to the same
point on the the other side / and than should the matter stand yet at the large.
For of two c^ntraryes if both the parts be proved / than stand they both
unproven. And therefore quod he I pray you answer me this a little. When you
believe the church / wherefore do you bylyue the church? do you not believe yt
because yt ^ayth truth? Yes mary q I what else. And how know you quod he yt
the church says troth? Know ye that any other wise than by scripture? Nay
mary q I. But than by plain scripture I know yt very well. For ye scripture
tells me that god has fully taught and techeth his church and byddeth me
believe his church. Lo q he for all our long process se where to ye be
brought now. Ye would in any wise before / and ye seemed to prove yt to (all y^
while yt ye argued and I answered) that the church was in all necessary poyntys
of our faith / as much to be byleued as the scripture / and that we should not
have byleued the scripture but for the authoryte of the church / as ye say
saint Austeyn says. And now when I argue and ye answer / I have dreue^ you to
the wall in three wordys / and prouyd unto you yt the church is not to be
byleued / nor that your self byleueth yt not but for the authoryte of the
scripture. And after that he had thus said / yt remanau^t yt were present
allowed it much / and I was there with astonyed and said I would advise me ferther
thereon. But he laughed and said he would lend me this and not to be hasty on me
/ for he would give me respyte of payment till I had spoken with you again.
Wha^ your friend had told / forsorth q I he delte with you like a courteys
credytour. And sith he has given you so long day / ye shall not need I trust
to dye in his debt. And to say the truth ye owe him not myche. For ye may
here him his own again and tell him his money is naught. But I have espied yt
is as he says a great aduau^tage for him to oppose. For he has such craft
in arguyng / that he will sone bring the answerer to a peryllous point / if he
happen on one that will answer him h^nsomly as he would have him. But on the
the other side if he had happened on one that had answered him as frowardly as the
boy answered one Caius a peote at Cambryge / than had he by his opposynge part
/ won nothing at all. For Caius for his pleasure playenge with the boy
being a young sophyster / said that he would prove the boy an ass. Which
when ye boy denied / well quod Caius thou wylt grant me this first that every
thing yt has two erys is an ass. Nay mary master will I not quod the boy. No
wylt thou quod Caius / Ah wyly boy / there thou wentest beyond me. For and
thou would have granted me that / I would have proved the an ass a none.
Mary master q the boy so ye might well / and so might every fool do. well quod
Caius I will go now a another way to work with the. Thou will grant me yt
every ass has two erys. Nay mary will I not master quod ye boy. Why so boy q
he. Mary master quod he for some ass may hap to have never one / for they
may be cut of both. Nay quod Caius I give the over for thou art to froward a
boy for me. And so if ye had not granted what he would / he had nothing won
at your hand. Why q your friend what thing did I grant him that I should not?
Forsooth quod I no more but all that ever ye granted. For first when he asked
you whyther ye cause why we believe the church be not because it is true that ye
church tells you / though your answer which ye made therein was not the
cause of your redargucyon nor the thing whereby ye were concluded / yet
answered ye not well thereto when ye granted yt. Why quod he wherefore should I
believe the church or any man else but bycawse they tell me true. Some time q
I yt happeth so / but sometime yt happeth otherwise. For if a known liar tell
you a known true tale / ye will believe him because he tells you truth. But
now if a known true man tell you an unknown troth ye believe not him /
bycawse the thing is truth / but ye believe ye thing to be troth because ye
believe the man to be true. And so believe you ye chirch / not because it is
troth yt ye church tells you but ye believe the troth of ye thing because ye
church tells yt. But yet was not ye answer of his as I say ye thing that
confounded you. For now if ye so should have answered him as I have showed you
/ though ye should have somewhat blenched him therwyth / yet h^^ might and would
of lykelyhed have gon^ ferther with you / and have asked you whereby ye know
that ye should believe the church. And what answer would ye than have made
thereunto? Mary q he than might I have said that I believe ye church / because
that in such necessary poyntys of faith the church can not err. That had be^
very well said quod I. But he would have asked how ye know that Than must I
quod he have said the same that I did / that I know yt by plain and euydent
scripture that the church in such thyngys can not say but true. And than
would I have laid him the textes that ye alleged unto me for the same purposed
before. If ye so had said quod I ye had a^swerd him truly but yet not with
your most aduau^tage. Why so q he? For quod I your next a^swere were to say as
troth is / that ye believe that the church in such things can not err /
bycawse ye believe that god has taught and told ye same things to his church.
Tha^ would he have asked me ferther quod your friend what thing makes me to
bileue yt god has taught and told the church those things. So would he have
asked you quod I / and so might he well. Tha^ were we common quod your friend
unto the same point again that he should have concluded me as he did before.
Nay q I not if ye answered thereto well. Why q he what could I answer else /
but clearly grant him yt I believe yt thing for none other cause but only
because ye scryptur so shows me? No could yt q I? what if never scripture had been wryte^ in this world / should there never have been any church or
congregacyon of faithful and right byleuyng people? That wot I nere q he. No
do ye quod I? were there never any folk that byleued in god / and had a true
faith between Adam and Noe / of such as never herd god speak them self? Yes
quod he I suppose there were some / but yt should seem there were very few. For
there were few saved in No^s ship. The world was at yt time quod I waxen worse
and worse as yt waxes now. But yt is not unlikely that there were many right
byleuyng people in the mean time. That is quod he lykely enough. Now as for ye
days quod I of Noe himself / though there were few saved alive / yet proves
not that / ye people to be all myscreau^tes and without faith. For yt fared be
them as yt faceth now by us / that there were many that byleued the troth and
had a faith / but they folowe^ (...) ^^esshe and san^^ for their sin? For
there appears no ferther upon the story i^ ^^^^sis / but yt the world w^^
^^sshed with the water of the great flode for the fylthe of their flesshely
living. And all be yt that in the first epistle of saint Peter / yt might
seem some me^edulytye in them / yet may yt be y^ yt stretched no ferther than
to ye lakke of fere in the credence of gods co^myn^cyon / and over much hope
and boldness of goddys ferther favor and sufferaunce whereof they repented
after to late for this psent life / and yet many through goddys mercy not to
late for the fynall salvation of their souls (as appears by the good and
great clerk Nicolaus de lyra upon ye same place) which could in no wise have
been so if they had lakked faith. Which faith what scripture had they to teache
the^ / or all the men in effect yt any faith had from Adam thytherto? Was
there also no faithful folk at all from Noe to Moses / nor him self neither
till he had the law delivered him in writing? Did Abraam never believe more but
those things that we find in scripture specially to have been told him by
god? Was his father and all his fre^dys infydeles? Were there no people beside
in all that long time that had a right faith? Yes quod your friend yt I think
verily there was. That may ye quod I be sure there was. And why did any man
tha^ believe ye church that is to wit the nombre and congregacyon of good and
right byleuynge folk / of whose mouth and tradycyon he herd the true believe /
against the wrong and mys^e believe that was in all the world among infydeles
and Idolaters bysyde? why did any man this / but because they byleued yt god
has taught those things to good (...) byfor^/and th^^ yt was and w^lde ^e
still the good lesson of god / and then what thing made them to believe that god
had taught them so? It was not the scripture that made the^ believe yt / as ye
would that nothing can tell us that bylefe but the scripture. I pray you tell
me what scryptur has taught the church to know which bookys be the very
scripture / and to reiecte many other that were written of y^ same matters and
that in ^^che wise written / and in the namys of such men as (^auynge for ye
spirit of god given to his church) a natural wise man had been lykely enough
/ either to have taken both for holy scryptur / or to have rejected both as
none holy scripture? And surely in the receyte of the tone / and reieccyon of
the the other / there would have been at the lest way such diverse opynyons yt the
hole church had never taken all ye tone sort and rejected all the the other / had
not that holy spyryte inspyred that consent / qui facit vnanimes in domo /
which ma^yth the church all of one mind and accord. And therefore all be yt
that against them that no thing will believe but scripture / we prove
thauthoryte of ye church by scripture / and in such wise prove it them by
scripture / that they shall be feign either ferther to grant that they be
bounden to believe the church in things not specyfyed in scripture / and as
fully as they believe the scripture self / or else they shall deny the
scripture and all / yet should we have byleued the church if n^uer scripture
had been wryte^ / as those good faithful fol^e did / that byleued well before
the scripture was written. And (...) the scripture self makes us not believe
the scripture / but ye church mak^th us to know ye scripture. And god without
scripture has taught his church ye knowledge of his very scripture from all
counterfete scripture. For yt is not as I say the scripture yt makes us to
believe the word of god wryte^ in ye scripture (For a man might (as happily
many does) read yt all to gyder and believe thereof never a whyt) but yt is the
spyryte of god that with our own towardness and good endeavor / works in
his church and in every good membre thereof the credulyte and bylyef / whereby we
believe as well the church concerning goddys wordys taught us by the church
and by god graued in mennys hartys without scripture / as his holy wordys
wryte^ in his holy scripture. And thus ye perceive that where ye^ granted him
that so did oppose you / yt we believe yt church by none other way but by ye
scripture / there did ye not answer him well. For we beside the scripture do
believe ye chyrch^ because that god him self by secret inspyracyo^ of his holy
spyryt / does (if we be wyllyng to learn) teache us to believe his church. And
also if we will walk with him / ledeth us in to the bylyefe thereof / by the
self same mean by which he techeth us and ledeth us in to ye bylyef of his
holy scryptur. For like wise as wha^ we here ye scripture or read yt / if we be
not rebellyous but endeavor ourself to believe / and captyue and subdew our
understanding to serve and follow faith / prayng for his gracyous aid and help /
he than works with us / and inwardly does inclyne our heart in to th^ssent of
that we read / and after a little spar^e of our faith / encreaceth the credence
in our incredulyte / so does his goodness in likewise inclyne and move the mind
of every (...) heretyq^^. In which letter he wrote that the (...) ^^we talk of
did no more ^biu^e any heresye / than he had done him self or the man yt he
wrote unto. And yet was his writing as false as god is true. Wherwyth he
labored covertly to make the man believe / that th^pynyons were none heresies.
And that he which was pretended to have abiured them had not so done in deed /
but had well auowed them and sty^lye a byden by them. Lo thus do such as are
of that sect / set forth their m^t^rs with lies and reason is yt yt they so
do. For sith their sectys be false / lies be for them m^ste mete. And yet is yt
a mad thing of them to boste of him. For he forthwyth forsook them / and
ever before his judges (...) (...)there side. There is a mean^ may seru^ (...)
both. Ye q he / but wot ye what the wife said y^ co^playned to her gossep of
her husbands frowardnes? She said her husband was so wayward that he would
never be plesed. For if his bread quod she ^e dowe baken / than is he angry.
Mary no marvel q her goss^^. Mary and wot ye what go^^^p quod she? And if I
(...) yt all to har^^ c^lys yet is he not content neither by saint Iame. No
quod her gos^^^^^ ye ^^^lde bake y^ in a mean. In a mean quod she? ^ary I can
not h^ppen on yt. And s^ in a ^^ayer of mary as yt is much work to happen on
the mean. And than to say they^ to short is lack of devotion. And to say
them to seryously is somewhat superstycy^^se. And therefore the be^^ way were
in mind / to say none at all. Y^ q I / but tha^ is god as wayw^^d a^ husband
as ye spoke of / y^ wy^ neither be content with his br^de bre^nyd to c^les / nor
dough bake^ neither. By our lady q he but be he content or not I wene he h^th
much dowgh bake^ bread among. For the ma^^^s I tell you be in some pl^cys
so^g^n faster than I can say the^. Peradventure q I s^ were i^ need. For if
they sh^ld sing m^^ens no faster tha^ ye say th^^ / they should I wen^ sing v^ry
fe^ (...) in a year. In fayth^ he and some ye (...) the^ m^ke me to do^e myth /
whether ye (...) in their hyues use to say matens among them. For (...) such a
another buzzyng they make. Surely q I yt is as true as yt is evil done. For as
yt is a vice and some faw^e to (...) in the service of g^d superstycyouse in
(...) of relygyouse / over dredefull and scrupulous instead of (...) and
dylygent / so (...) and by writing that were present at all the handelyng^ of
ye matter. Well quod I we shall let their wysdom and their ler^yng alone. But
as for their honesty shall somewhat show yt self upon the troth or untruth
of their report. Wherein first I pray you could they say yt he was not
co^uyct^d by as many witnesses and as good and as credyble as the law
requires? So many q he and such as ye law requires? would god q he that we
cowd as easily find good men and true / as we may fyn^^ so many such. For the
law does as I here say require but twain / and yet in cause of heresy cares
not mich how bad they be / not though they be heretyques the^ self. And is not
this a wonderouse case yt where as in a matter of little money no law receives
any witness but honest and credyble / the law made by the church / should
in so great a matter / so hyghly towchyng the utter destruccyo^ of a man in body
and goodis with a death the most paynfull that can be devised / admytte and
receive a person infamed / and give faith and credence to an infydell whom
they have proved and reproved falls in his faith to god? Nor me thinks the
excuse but v^ry slender yt I have ere this herd in this point alleged for ye
church / that such simple witness are admytted in heresye / because the crime
is so great and so adyous that therefore yt is worthy to be handled with the more
rygour and the less favor. And this thing will I well agree for good reason in
ye punishment ^f the crime when yt is pro^^d. But for god not in hatred / and
persecucyon of the person ere the crime ^e proved. But now where as they
receive the witness of so ^leyghe and f^ls^ ^^lowes for a proof / they pursew
the person and not the crime. where as me thinks on ye the other side / the more
heyghnouse / ^dyouse and abhomynable that the crime is / the more slow / /should
we be to believe yt / and the more sure and plain proof should we have ere we
should judge any man for so evil to commyt yt. Three is quod I no dowt / but yt
the world is so bad / that there be many so naughty / that they will be ready
enough to bear false witness. And yet god forbede that yt were so bad as y^
say / that a man might sooner find such than good men and true. And also
though the witness were and would lie / yet when they be wisely and severally
examyned / they ca^ seldom so well make their tale before / but that their
untruth shall in some part appear. And finally the law byndeth not the judge
so precysely to the wordys of the wytnes / but that yt leueth many thyngys to
be pondered and wayed by his wisdom. For yt is in a judge as yt is in a
physycyon / to whom there be many good b^kys written / able to give good light
and instruccyon. And yet who so would so precysely bind him to his book / that
he should nothing use ye dyscre^^^o^ of his brain / he should sometime do full
evil service. And yet is it as Arystotle says well done i^ deed to make the
laws so suffycye^t / that as few thyngys as may / shall remain and be left
to the dyscressyon of ye judge / sithe that the comen la^^^ be con^^antely made
by many (...) t^^n are the p^rtyculer judges / and also many such as are as
wise as iud^^^. And ^uer that the laws (...) to the iud^^^ a sure and
substau^cyal sh^lde / to def^^ and keep the^ from ye (...) else would follow
their sentence on the tone side or the the other / were their judgment never so
just. For men be so percyall always to them self / that our heart ever
thinks the judgment wrong / that wryngeth us to the worse. For be it never
so right / all reken we wrong whereof we feel harm. But yet of all thing
specially the law should best content us / for that yt is ferthest out of all
cause of suspycyo^. For where as a judge medleth with ^ matter present / and
persons who^ he sees and knows / whereby there may per^as favor / hatered /
hope / or dred / pytye / cruelte / mede / request / or some other affection
inclyne him to mysordre him self in the matter / ye laws always be made for the
punishment of things only that are yet to come / and who shall fall in y^
parell the makers can not tell. Happily their foo^/happily their fre^dys (and as
me^nys manners be mutable) peradventure them self / for which cause ye ma^ers
of ye law made by ye people in cawses cryminal / can be but indy^ferent. And
therefore I me^^^yle y^ more / sith y^ f^ut ye find now is not in the judges
but in the laws self. Wherein ye think yt evil provided that for the hatered
of an heyghn^use ^^yme / ye person peradventure innocent should fall in parell
of a paynfull ^ethe by the more sleyght witness tha^ would be ^^ke^ for
su^^ycyent in a far sleyghte^ matter. Somewhat ye said in deed if the ^^te^^d
of the crime were all y^ (...). But therein ye go far wide. For y^ chyef cause
why that in ^eyghnous^ (...)/as thef t^/murder / (...)/and heresye / the law
takes such for ^^tne^^^ as yt will not accept in a (...) other co^tr^ct m^de
between two parties / is for that else all such crimes should pass sorth
vnp^nisshed / and thereby should ye world swarmfull of such myscheuous people for
lack of proof and trial in the matter / because that those which go about
such an heyghnous deed as coming ones to knowledge would bring them to ^
shameful death / do not use comenly / to take a notary / and honest witness
(...) them to make an instrument thereof / as many men do and all men may do in
a contracte or co^e^^unt / but use yt by s^elth as cou^^tly as they can. By
reason whereof / reason month and necessyte co^pelleth (except ye would all have
all go to naught) to receive such recordys as they be wont to make of their
consayle / which be as ye wo^e well none but such as they be them self. And
yet sometime which may some more strange / we be content and r^son would we
so were / with y^ wytne^^^ of the parties them self. For if th^e.x. theuys
robbed four men at onys in a wood / though all y^ good that they take a way
were / one come^ purs of all four / and would all.x. when they were taken well
and sty^ly say n^^e / yet were I their judge (sith all wy^^^^e seems not only
to induce a crede^ce or ^^^dulyt^ in the iuges mind) I would not let (except
some other cyrcu^stance wyth^^ode yt) to believe the.iiii. complay^^ys in their
own matter against all ten defendauntys. And all be yt that percase a judge
might be in a contracts made between two parties ^^duced in his own mind
without any dowte to the con^^a^y to give c^^^^^e i^ such a point to y^ t^ne
perte a^^i^st y^ totherfor the well kn^^en tr^nth and (...) of yt t^ne / ^ in
y^ the other per^e the (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) ready to be pre^hed as yt
seemed if the world would so change that the time would ^er^e yt. And when he
was in his ex^mynacyo^ sore preced upon to tell for what intent he made such a
serm^^ ready and laid yt up so secretly / destytute at last of all excuses
yt might be^^ any color of any good cawse / w^ll quod he I se^ well I must
tell ^ll / I am loathe to hurt any body. And thervppon he told how yt was made
ye mo^^ p^^te by the man yt was abiured / of wh^m we specially speak. So that
now s^ttynge all this gere to gether / this m^^nys confe^^yon / his secret
friend and co^p^nyon in such matters / his old accusacyons of like matters / the
heretyques confessyons that founded their heresies in the same matters v^^on
thautoryte of his sermon / and besydys all this mo than.xx. witnesses pl^ynly
proving the matter against him / I would feign wit who had right if he had
wrong / all though (...) had been used to him more rygour a g^ete dele than
therwas.

The.v. chapyter.
The author proves that ye spyrytu^ll judges did ye man meruylouse fau^ur /
and alm^st more than laufull / in that they admytted him to such^ an abiuracyo^
as they did / and that they did not rather leave him to the secular handys.

WHy q he what dyuyll rygoure could they more have showed for the first time /
than make hy^ ad^^re and bear a faggot? Yes q^^^ I some man h^d l^uer bear twayn
(...) in his (...)/than have one ^ere him (...) on a fire a^ his feet. In
^^^th qu^d he they coud not have done (...) to him at the first time. No q I
no^ if he wyllyngly returned to ye church knoulegynge his fault / and ready to
abjure all heresies / and penetently submytted himself to penance. And else
if he prove him self obstynate and impenytent / the church neither is bounden
nor ought to receive him / but utterly may forsake him and leave him to the
secular^ handys. But now was he so obstynate that he would not abjure of long
time. And diverse days were his judges feign of their favor to give him /
with sufferaunce some his best frendys and whom he most trusted / to resort
unto him. And yet scantely could all this make him submytte hi^ self to make
his abiuracyon. And finally were they feign for saving of his life / to dyuyse
a form of abiuracyon / whereof I never saw y^ like / nor in so plain a case
never would we^e I y^ judge / suffer ye like here after. what man was that quod
he? Mary qu^d I his abiuracyon was such that he theri^ abiured and forsware
all her^sy^s / knowlegyng him self lawfully conuycte. But where as they be
wont to confess in their own abiuracyon that they have holden such heresies
and be gyltye thereof / that would he do in no wise / but as clearly as his
f^wte was proved / and by as many / yet would he not to dye therefore confess
him self fawtye / but always stood still upon yt in virtue of his oath that
all they belyed him. It might happen quod he that he had forgoten yt he so had
pched. That were quod I great wounder. For I am sure when he had ^er^ed so in
so many placys / he had not done yt of a sudden adventure / but of a delyberat
purpose / which except he fell mad / yt were no well pos^yble f^r him in so
great a matter to forgete. And bysydes this yt was also deposed / th^^ i^ a
place where he pched/he was after the sermon resoned wythall forth^^^. And by
an honest ley man had yt laid unto his charge / yt he had parelousely preched
/ showing him wherein. Where unto he made answer not that he had not said so /
nor that he had not meant so / or that they had mysse taken and wrong
understood his wordis / but that he would preche there again son^ after / and
prove his prechynge true by the old doctors of the church. And this happed
him not long before yt he was accused. Was yt not possible by your faith that
he could have forgote this? It was quod he possible enough that all to gether
was false / and that they lied all. For so might they do by possybylyte being
but men / and though they had been mo the^ they were. And then he peradventure
knowing that they so did / why should he falslye confes^^ a fawte in him self
for the falsehed of other folk? That is q I true if he so knew yt. But how
could yt be so / against so many prouys sworen and dep^syng the matter upon
their oaths / being though they were but me^ / yet men of wit and honestye^
some well learned also / and men that bare him no dyspleasur for any other matter
than his evil prechyng / men almost all such as would have none other matter to
him / folk that never had other matter with him / and many of them of little
acqua^ntaunce or (...) the one with the other / so t^^^ the^e was n^ fere of
conspyryng to gyder i^ one (...) ^et quod he were yt possible yt they might ly^
all. And what quod I yt he had b^^ accused^ other places byfore^ (...) both
there had gone of l^te^^ horse or two / and that he would so clearly prove yt
that yt could not be the contrary. if Sy^^en said and laid his wager the
contrary / and than they both should chese us for judges / and we coming all
four in to the way / Wylken would show us on the ground part in ye clay and
part peradventure in the snow the prent of horse fete and of mennys fete also
by a long way ten mile together and ye will / till they come at a water where as
went a way by ship no man can tell who nor whyther yt forces not for our wise
case / but now if Wylken would say that he had won his wager / for lo here ye
se the prent of ye horse fete all this way shone and all with the very naylys
in them / so that yt may be none other wise but horse h^the gone here / if
Symken after all this would say the wager were his for yt is not proved that any
horse had goone there / for yt might be that they were geldynges or ma^es /
here were we fallen in a great questyon of the law / whyther ye gray mare may
be ye better horse or not / or whither he have a wise face or not that looks
as like a fool as an ewe looks like a sheep. And in this question if the
parties demurred in our judgment / we might ask advise ferther of lernyd men
and iudgis We might quod he be suyt to be sure of the matter / make yt a cheker
chamber case. Or saving the premunyre / we might have yt tried in the rote at
Rome. Uery well q I so that I see well by your wit and mine together / one
shy^^e or other we should find for a final end therein / if the doubt were in
that point. But now if Symken styc^ed not thereto / but would say thus lo here
ye see the men have g^^e (...) way / and how can y^ th^n be ^^^e that any horse
went here. For I (...) ^ayth he that these men which went here had horse
sh^^e in their (...) made fast upon long s^elys / and (...) as they went
prykked the^ down has in the grounde^ Cut quod he this (...) a wy^e
inuencyon. Ueryly q I to (...) yt would not seem very gay. But now if Symkyn
were contencyous and would say the wager were his except yt be so proved that yt
can be none other wise but that horse have of late gone there and then will say
to us lo syrs as ye se it yt may be other wise. For me^ might make with their
ha^dys all the prentes of horse shone in the ground. And tha^ if we would say
that was never so / he would ask us how can we be sure thereof / while we can
not say nay but yt might be so / and tha^ would ^^yll prece upon us with this
questyon may yt not be so. It may q he by possybylite be so. Than quod I when
we grant him onys that yt may be so / than will he by and by put case that yt
were so. And then if we grant him his case onys for the possybylyte / than
will he shortly conclude that the the other part is not so surely proved / as yt
must be if Wylken should win the wager. What should we say to him now / to
whom should we give the wager? In faith quod he I wot nere what to say to him.
And the matter is so mad that as for the wager what I would give Wylkyn I wot
nere / but as for Symkyn except he better impugned ye proof / if the wager were
but a butter fly / I would never awarde him one wynge. Surely quod I and you
shall rule ye m^^er for me. For if ye give n^ught / he gets as little of me.
But now what if he wax angry yt his proper inuencyon were no more set by /
nor his wit no more regarded / and would there upon help forth his part with
his oath and swear upon a bo^e that himself saw when the me^ made those
pryntys in ye ground with horse sh^ne h^lden in their handys / what would ye
then say? Mary quod he than would I say and swear to yt beside ye loss of his
wager he had like a false folysh knave lost his honest and his soul to. In
good faith quod I and for aught I se yet I durst be bold to swear with you. And
tha^ lettyng wylken alone with Symken dysputyng their sophem them self / let us
return (...) again to our own matter. In which while there were so many so
clear and open prouys against ye man of whom we speak all this while / though it
were possible yt all they might be false / yet could there none indyfferent
judge so think / except it were so proved / and yt by other means tha^ ye
only oath of ye pertie yt is accused / sweri^g alone against the^ all. Yet q he
for all yt if he know indede yt he did it not / he does but well to abide by ye
truth. Uery soth ye say quod I. Nor Symken neither if he saw the men prent
the horse shone in ye high way though yt seemed us never so unlikely / yet
had he done well enough to say yt and swear yt to and styfly to stycke
therby^ And yet ye remember parde that if he so would have sworn ye and I both
durst right now right boldly have bileued yt he lied. And might we not well
believe the same in our case to? Yes quod he yt will I well. And therefore the
iudgys did him but right to reken him as conuycted / and therefore to compel
him to (...). But yet they showed him therein no such favor as ye speak of /
in yt they admitted him to his abiuracyo^ without co^fessynge of ye fault. For if
they had forced him thereto / they had in my mind done him plain and open wrong
/ because yt might be yt he said and swear true. And then should they have
forced him against his co^scye^ce / to say of him self untrue. And that should
they do not only clean against right / but also without necessytye /
co^syderynge yt they might as in conclusyo^ they did / abjure him other wise.
And therefore they took the best way both for him and for them self also But
sins they did therein none other wise the^ as they were of duty bou^de^ / yt
well appears he had therein no such favor as ye would make yt seem that they
showed him. well q I sith your self agrees yt he had no wrong / albe yt no
favor had be^ showed him / yet were your erand a^swered as far as touches
his abiuracyo^. and now if I should prove you yt his judges showed him such
favor / I fere me lest I should therwt su^what seem to charge them that they
had done though not wrong / yet very nere wrong / ye favor apperyng to be
showed / if not against ye law / yet at the lest way ye law for favor so far
streched forth / yt ye lether could scant hold. But yet these they for me. For
sithe I have said yt / I will tell you why / and so much the more boldly
between us twain / for that I perceive not in you any such manner of mind
toward them / that ye would blow abroad any fawte of unlawful favor founden
in them. Ah well said quod he and lawghed. Ye wene I were more ready to
report their rygoure then any point of their favor. well ^^ken of you quod
I. I se well a man ca^ not have a good opynio^ of you / but your co^scye^ce
co^str^^th it to ye contrary. But now for ye matter / I trow we be agreed both
/ yt al were it so yt ye man had be^ fautlesse in deed / yet were ye prouys
against him so many / so good / so cle^e and euyde^t / and so much more tha^
suffycye^t / y^ neither his judges nor our self neither / nor I think his own
father neither if if he had herd the^ / could have thought hi^ other tha^ very
gretely gyltie. Surely q he yt is true Now q I yt being true yt they coud non
other wise reke^ in him though he still swear ye contrary / must yt not needs
be yt in his denyenge in virtue of his oath / ye things which they coud not
but bileue true / they must needs therwt believe him all ye while to lie and be
periured^ That follows q he Now q I wha^ one is accused and convicted of
heresy / what thing will ye law yt ye church shall receive him to? what thing q
he? mary to mercy. Nay q I mercy is ye thing as it seems yt they receive him
by / not ye thing yt they receive him to. The^ is yt quod he to penance. That
seems well said q I. For the church by mercy receives him to penance. But
now q I does ye chirch openly receive to penance any person appering and
proui^g him self still impenyte^t? Nay quod he. Appears not he still impenyte^t
q I yt still appears perjured / and still standing in perjury? And where ye
first part of penance is co^fessyo^ and humble knowlegynge of the fau^/can
the church reken him penyte^t yt still refuses to confess his faut / y^ lies
falsely still / and falsely forswereth himself? The church quod he can not
surely know whyther he swear true or false / and therefore they can not surely
judge him ^orsworen. For yt may be by po^^^^bylyte that all the witness lied.
It may be to quod I by possybylyte if we go this way to work / yt all ye men
lied yt ever have said they came fro Rome / and that al ye dryefys and bullys
were feigned that ever were supposed to be brought fro thense / for aught that
he can tell that never came there him self / For some one man might lie and some
one bull or brief might be feigned / and so some other and one by one / and so
forth of all the remanau^t. For like possybylyte is therein every one as is in
any one. And peradventure as for your own self have never yet talked with.xx.
yt have told you they have been at Rome. No no q he nor I wene with.x. neither.
And how many bulls q I and bryesys have ye seen that came thense. By our lady q
he b^llys very few / and bryf^ never non / for I never ask after the^. The^ q
I might you by your own reason as well dowte whyther there were any Rome or no
/ as whyther that man lied and were forsworn or no. But in this point I will
not long styck with you. For surely sta^dyng the matter in such case yt his iudgis
could not otherwise thynk of him but yt he was fauty of thyngys which he still
in virtue of his oath denied / all were yt so that they might think therwyth
yt by possybylyte they might be in that mind deceived / yet while they could
not think that they could have none other mind / but that he (though yt might
by possybylyte be true that he swear) yet was forsworn in deed / and in very
ded^ perseuered in perjury. Now the matter I say sta^dyng in such case / sith
he yt (...) so plain apperyng perjury / stands in ye denial of his faut and
falls de^^er of him self cannot be re^^ned of his fawte penyte^t / and unto
penance ought none impenytent person to be admyttyd / I will not say yt his
iudgys did wrong. But sure^y me thynkith I may well say that they showed him
great favor / in that they receyuyd him to penance without ye co^fessyo^ of his
faut. And I thynk verily it was a favorable fassyon of abiuracyon / and so
strange yt the like has been very seldo^ seen if ever yt were seen before. And
yt did they in hope yt god shall send him more grace in time to come / and so I
be^ech hi^ to do. For I promise you for my part I never can co^ceyue good hope
of his ame^dme^t / all ye while yt I se ye pride abide still in his heart / yt
cannot suffer hi^ for shame to confess his faut.

The.vi. chapyter.
The author shewyth yt the person abiured for his own honest worldly / and
for the more fruit of his prechynge / if he be suffered to preche in time to
come / yt were much better for him openly and wyllyngly to confess the trothe.
And yt now by the sta^dyng still in the denial / he both shamyth him self /
and should if he pr^chyd sklaunder the word of god.

IT is q he peradventure better thus. For than should he sclau^der him self and
the word of god also / if he should hereafter preche again Nay mary q I than
should he rather deliver him self fro sclau^der and the word of god also. For
than should every man se the dyuell cast clean out of his heart / and hope yt he
should be fro thensforth a very good man. where now thynki^g him to parseuer in
a proud par^ury / we can none other thynk but yt he must nedys be very naught
still / though we should herafter here him preche never so well. and yt were a
sore sclau^der to the word of god / yt men should se him who^ they here preche
well / so proud an ypochryte and therwt so folysh to / yt for a false hope of
his own estymacyo^ preseruyd / he laboryth as much as in him is to make the
world wene ye.xx. true men were forsworn against him. wherein while there ye no
man so mad to believe him / he le^eth (if he preche in this plyght) all his hole
purpose / and wins nothing but the contrary / yt is double shame of his
proud perjury and hye malycyous mind / instead of the praise yt he lokyth and
prechyth for.

The.vii. chapyter.
The mesenger moves a questyo^ / it a man be sworn by a judge to say the
troth of hi^ self in a crime whereof he is had suspect / whether he may not
lawfully on his oath swear vntrewth / where he thynkyth ye treuth ca^ not be
prouyd against him. wheru^to thauthor a^sweryth yt he is bou^de^ upon perell
of perjury to say and co^fes troth And yt much more syn and folly both was it
the^ for ye man yt thus was abiuryd to forswere him self in the thing yt he
wist well would be prouid / and a shame less folly to stand still by his perjury
/ wha^ he saw ye matter so clearly proved in deed. And with this fynyshyth he ye
matter of his abiuracyon.

IN good faith q he I begin in this matter to be of your mind For ye matter being
so plain and clearly proved / it was and is both syn and folly to stand i^ ye
deny^^g. But there comes a thing in my mi^d though it be su^what out of our
matter / wherein I would be glad to here what ye think. what thing is y^ q I^
Mary q he I have hard su^ well learned men say if a man were accused of a faut
yt were true in deed / yet if it be secret and ca^ not be proved / in a^ oath
put unto him he may and ought to swear nay because y^ of secret and unknown
things no man ^ be his judge. For only god is judge of manes heart. And / if
he should confess it where he nedyth not before (...) co^pete^t judge / yt is
to wit his secret faut openly before me^ whereof only god is judge / tha^ should
he defame him self / and yt were, great syn. For holy scripture says / cura^
habe de bond noi^e. Take heed of thy good name. Et meliore^ nome^ bonu^ q
diuitie multe. Better is a good name the^ much richesse. And yt says also /
Maledictus homo q negligit fama^ ^ua^. A cursed is yt man yt cares not what
me^ say of hi^. And therefore I have hard some well lernyd men say / yt in this
case a man may boldly deny the matere upon his oath be yt never so true / so
yt yt be so secret as yt be not able to be proved by witness. Forsooth quod I
it is a large and a long matter to speak of per^ury. But as for this point I
hold it i^ my mind little questyo^. For I hold this onys for a sure and a^
infallible co^clusyo^ / yt a man may never lawfully be forsworn. Mary troth
it is yt a mannys oath receives interpretacyo^ / and is not always bounden
precysely to ye wordis. As if a judge would swear me generally in a court to
make true answer to such things as should be asked of me / and after mine oath
given / he would ask me certain questions of matters nothing be lo^gi^g to him
/ I were not by mine oath bounden to make him answer / for as much as no such
thing was i^ mine oath intended. And therefore if a pressed yt had herd a m^nys
confessyo^ were called before a judge and sworn for a wytnes / he might boldly
swear he knew nothing of ye matter. Not for ye come^ gloss yt ye co^fessyo^ was
not made to him as to him self but as to gods mynyster / but for yt ye law
dyschargyth him of shewi^g any such thing / no less tha^ if his oath were
given him in this manner / what know ye of this matter out of confession. For
else if there were a tyrau^t yt would co^pelle him by express wordys to swear
what he knew by y^ m^nys co^fessyo^ / y^ co^fessor had in my mind no remedy
but to tell him plainly / sir I will not swear for you nor in such matter make
you any a^swere to dye therefore / not for any thing yt I know in ye man for
this matter though I told you all his hole co^fessyo^ a non / but for the evil
yt should grow by such a precede^t. For if I should now excuse an innocente
swerynge truly that I hard no such thing in his confession / I should in
some other cause either be forsworn / or by my refusinge to swear I should
make the man the more suspecte / i^ that I refuse to swear as myche for him as
I did for a no^ther. And therefore will I not make any answer in this for ye
perell yt may fall in other. And with this answer^ or such other must he
plainly refuse to swear what pain so ever he should endure therefore. And in
like wise if any judge would give an oath to any person to tell him ye truth of
any crime / which were so secret as the judge had never hard any thing thereof
/ but would for his only pleasure know by the ma^nys oath whither there were
peradventure any such thing or not / ye pertie may deny to swear or to make him
answer therein. But o^ ye the other side if he be denou^ced or detected unto him /
either by commune fame or other i^formacyo^ / with such co^iertures and
lykelyhedes as the law gives ye judge authorite to give ye pertie an oath for
ye ferther search of ye matter / there is he plainly hou^de^ upon pain of
eternal da^nacyo^ with out coueryng or cautell to show and disclose ye plain
troth / and to have more respect to his soul tha^ to his shame. For as for
those textes which ye alleged / be far from this point. For they no^e other
mean / but y^ a man should in his living avoid ^ot only sin / but also all
occacyo^s whereby me^ might have reasonable cause falsely to dy^fame him. And it
was never me^t of ye shame yt a man takes of his own co^fessyon for his sin
committed in deed. For by yt he lesyth not his good name / but gets his good
name among good folk. and as for of evil me^nes words there is no rekeni^g. But
surely as I say if a man had be^ as ill as a devil / and after repe^ti^g his
syn would for perte of his penance wyllyngly offer him self to ye sufferau^ce
of open shame / there were no good christian man yt would after yt like ye man yt
wors / but a great deal ye better. And if all such open co^fessyo^ were sin
/ there was much syn used among good folk many day in Crystes chirch / wha^ yt
was mich better tha^ yt is now. Lo Acha^ yt had committed sacrylege whereof is
written in Iosue / was exorted by Iosue to confess his fault openly / and give
glory to god yt had detected him by lottis. And so did he / and mekely suffered
for his syn as well the shame and wonder of the world / as the pain and
bytternes of death. And therefore I no more dout of that the^e / but that he is a
glorious saint in heaven / tha^ I dout of yt these ye christ promised Paradyse
hanging on ye cross. And ^urely if me^nys old fautys were still their i^famy
after their ame^deme^t / tha^ was saint Peter little beholde^ to saint Matthew
and other of his felows yt have slau^dred him in their gospels / tellyng how
sha^fully after all his crakes he forsook his master and forsware hi^ both. if
a good man ware naght / ye bet^ he was ye more sin it is and ye more shame
also. And is yt not tha^ i^ reso^ o^ ye the other side if a naughty man wax good /
ye worse he was ye better is for hi^ and ye more worship also? Our lord says
hi^ self yt for one si^ner comi^g again to grace / there is more joy i^ heue
than upon almost an hundred good folk yt never sinned. And reke^ we then yt
man shamed by ye knolege of his ^yn here among sinful me^ / whose humble
confession and me^e ame^deme^t wi^neth him so much worship in heaven? Trust me
truly wha^ a man has done evil if he be duly swore^ / it is a worshipful
sha^e and a joyful sorrow to confess ye treuth and good folk though they
abhore ye si^ / yet love they and co^med ye man / as one yt was noght and is
good. And ye shame yt he co^ceyueth i^ his heart before ye world / geteth him
great honor before god. and ye short glowi^g here in his chekis spedely
burns up and wastes / yt never wastyng fire of hell / standing him ferther
instead of great perte of his purgatory. And therefore to ye point yt we speak
of without long process I tell you plainly my mind / yt no man can be excused
from the perell of e^dlesse da^nacio^ / yt would upon boldness of any doctors
opynyo^ / hyde or cover his fault by any cautell / after a lawful oath given
him to tell ye plain trothe therein. And who so will say ye contrary he must
nedys hold plain against ye law / and say yt no judge may lawfully give an oath
to the perty. whereof should the oath serve if ye party might lefully forswere
him self? And also if ye judge may not lawfully give him y^ oath / tha^ may he
refuse to swear / and may not first swear and tha^ say false. which every man
must upon da^pnacyo^ eschew though he folily take an oath / where he lawfully
might refuse yt. Forsothe quod he me thinks ye take the sure way. well q I if
this be so in one yt is swore^ where ye matter as he thinkyth ca^ not be well
proved / how far wrong went the man that we speak of / to forswere him self
in a matter of prechyng / yt he will well was so open yt it would be plainly
proved what sin was therein / and what sin and folly thereto was there to
stycke still in his perjury / wha^ he saw ye matter a^lredy proved so clearly
and by so many / so good / so honest / and so indefferent / yt he could
nothing now win by ye de^^^e^^ but evil opynio^ / and almost a despair of his
ame^deme^t in all yt ever hatd hi^? In good faith q he all this is very truth
and there for we shall let him a lone till god send him better mind.

The.viii. chapyter.
The author shewethe why ye new testament of Tyndals tra^slacyo^ was burned.
and she with for a sample certai^ words evil and of evil purpos cha^gid

BUt now I pray you let me kno your mind concerning ye burni^g of ye new
testament i^ e^glish / which Tindal lately translated / and (as me^ say) right
well / which makethe me^ mich meruayl of ye burni^g It is q I to me great
meruayl / yt any good criste^ man having any drop of wit i^ his head / would any
thing meruell or co^playn of ye ^urni^g of ye book if he know ye matter. which
who so callith ye new testament calls it by a wrong name / except they will
call yt Tyndals testament or Luthers testament. For so had tyndall after
Luthers counsel corrupted and changed yt from the good and holso^ doctrine
of Criste to the deuylysh heresies of their own / yt it was clean a contrary
thing. That were maruayle q your friend yt it should be so clean co^traty. For to
some yt red it yt seemed very like. It is q I never the less contrary / and yet
ye more peryll^us. For like as to a true silver grote a falls coper grote is
never ye less contrary though yt be quyk syluered over / but so much ye more
false show mich it is cou^terfeted ye more like to the troth / so was ye
tra^slacio^ so mich ye more contrary i^ how mich it was cra^cely devised like /
and so much ye more peryllus i^ how miche it was to folk vnlernyd more hard to
be dyssernid why q your fre^d what fautes were there sit? To tell you all / ye q
I were in a manner to rehearse you all ye hole hoke / wherein there were founden
and noted wrong and fa^^ly translated above a thousand textes by tale. I would
q he fayn here some one. He yt should q I study for yt / should study where to
find water in ye see. But I will show you for ensample two or three such as
every one of the three is more than thryes three in one. That were q he very
strange except ye mean more i^ weight. For one ca^ be but one in number.
Surely q I as weyghty be they as any lightly can be. But I mean ye every one of
them is more tha^ thryes three in number. That were q he su^what like a rydel.
This rydell q I will sone be red. For he has mystra^slated.iii. words of great
weight and every o^e of the^ is as I suppose more than thryes three times
repeted and rehearsed in ye book. Ah yt may well be q he / but yt was not well
done. But I pray you what words be they? The tone is q I this word prestys.
The to there / ye church. The third charity. For prestis where so ever he speaks
of ye pstes of Crystis chirch he never calls them prestes but always seuyours
/ the church he calls always the congregacyo^ / and charity he callyth all
(...) love. Now do these names in our englysh to^g neither expsse ye thyngis yt
be me^t by the^ / and also there appeth (ye circu^stau^ces well considered) yt
he had a mischeuous mind i^ ye change. For first as for prestes and psthed
though that of old they used come^ly to chese well elderly me^ to be prestes /
and therefore in ye greek tongue prestys were called presbiteri / as we might say
elder men / yet nether were all prestes chosen old as apperyth by sai^te Poule
wryti^g to Timotheus / nemo iuuenture^ tua^ co^te^pnat let no man co^te^pne thy
youth / nor every elder man is not a pressed. And in our englysh tongue this word
senyor sygnyfieth nothing at al / but is a french word used in englysh more
than half in mockage / when one will call a another my lord in scorn. And if he
mean to take ye laten word senyor / ye word i^ ye late^ to^g never sygnyfyed a
pressed but only an elder man. By which name of elder me^ if he would call ye
prestes e^glishly / tha^ should he rather sygnify their age tha^ their of fyce.
And yet ye name does i^ e^glish plai^ly sygnify chaldermen of ye cities / and
nothing ye prestys of ye church. And thus may we perceive yt rather than he
would call a pressed by ye name of a pressed / he would seek a new word he neither
wist nor cared what. Now where he calls the church always ye co^gregacyo^ /
what reso^ had he therein? For every man well sees ye though ye church be in
deed a co^gregacio^ / yet is not every co^gregacio^ ye chirch bu^ a
co^gregacio^ of criste^ people / which co^gregacio^ of christian people has been
in ^glo^d always called and known by the name of ye chirch. which name what good
cause or color could he find to torn in to ye name of co^gregacio^ / which
word is come^ to a company of criste^ me^ or a company of turkys? Like wysdom
was there in ye change of this word charity i^ to love. For though charity be
always love / yet is not ye wot well love allway charity. The more pytye by my
faith q your fre^d ye ever love was syn. And yet it would not be so mich so
taken if ye world were no more suspecious than they say yt good saint Fra^ces
^^s / which wha^ he saw a young man ^is a girl onis i^ way of good company /
kneled down and held up his handys in to heaven / hyghly thanking god yt
charity was not yet gone out of this wreched world. He had quod In good mind
and did like a good man / yt demed all thing to ye best. So say I to quod he.
But how far be folk fallen fro ye good mind now. Men be now a days waxen so
full of mystrust / that sum man would in faith wene his wife were naught / if
he should but find her in bed with a pore frete. Forsothe ye be a wanton quod
I. But yet in erneste how like you the change of these wordys: Surely q he
very naught. And that yt was not well nor wisely done / there will I trow no good
wise man deny. but yet whyther Hyche^s had in ye translacyo^ thereof any
malycyous purpose or not / therein will I till I se ferther play saint Frau^cys
part / and judge the man no wors than the matter requyrethe. First quod I
would ye that the book should go forth and be red still in that fassyo^? Nay in
good faith quod he that would I not if he use yt so very often. with that word
quod I ye hytte the nail on the head. For surely if he changed the comen
known word in to the better / I would well allow yt. If he chau^gid it in to
as good I would suffer yt. if sum what in to worse so he did yt selde I would
wynke at hit. But now wha^ he chau^geth the known usual namys of so great
thingis / in to so far the worse / and that not repeteth seldom / but so often
and so contynually inculketh / that almost in the hole book his lewd change
he never changes / in this manner could no man deem other / but that the man
meant myscheuously / sca^t such a good sely soul as would wene all were well
when he found his wife where ye said right now. if he called charity sometime by
the bare name of love / I would not stykke thereat. But now where as charity
sygnyfyethe in englysh mennys eres / not every come^ love / but a good virtuous
and well ordrede love / he that will studyously flee fro that name of good love
/ and all way speak of love / and always leave out good / I would surely say that
he meanethe n^ughte. In good faith quod he so is it not unlikely. Tha^ quod I
when ye se more ye shall say it is much more th^n lykly. For now yt is to be
considered that at the time of this tran^lacyon ^ych^ns was with Luther in
wyttenberge / and set certain gl^sy^ in the mergent / framed for the setting
forth of ye ungracious sect. By saint John quod your friend if that be true
that Hychens were at that time with Luther / it is a plain token yt he wrought
sumwhat after his counsel / and was willing to help his matters forward
here. But whyther Luthers matters be so badde as they be made for / that shall
we see hereafter. Uery true quod I. But as touching the confederacye between
Luther and him / is a thing well known and plainly confessed / by such as
have been taken and conuycted here of herysye coming from thense / and some of
them sent hither to sow that sede about here / and to send word thither
fro time to time how yt spra^g. But now ye cause why he changed the name of
charity and of the church and of presthed / is no very great dyffyculte to
perceive. For sith Luther and his fellows among other their damnable
heresies have one / that all our salvation standyth in faith alone / and toward
our saluacyo^ nothing force of good workys / therefore yt seems that he
laboreth of purpose to mynyshe that reverent mind yt men bear to charity / and
therefore he changes that name of holy virtuous affection / in to the bare
name of love comen to the virtuous love that man ^erith to god / and to the
lewd love that is between flekke and his make. And for because that Luther
utterly denies the very catholyque church in ^ri^^e / and says that the
church of Crist is but an unknown c^ngregacyon of sum folk here.ii. and
there.iii. no m^ wot where having the ^yght faith / which he calls only his
own new forgede faith / therefore ^^chens in the new testament can not abide
the name of the church / but turns it into the name of congregacyon / wyllyng
that yt should seem to englysh men / either that Christ in the gospel had never
spoken of the chirch / or else that the church were but such a congregacyon
as they might have occasyon to say / that a congregacyon of some such
heretyques were ye church that god spoke of. Now as towchi^ge the cause why he
changed the name of priest into senior / ye must understand that luthere and
his adherentys hold this heresye / that all holy order is nothing. And yt a
pressed is nothing else / but a man chosen among the people to preche / and that
by that choice to that o^^yce he is priest by and by without any more ado /
and no priest again when so ever the people chese a another in his place / and
that a preestys office is no thing but to preche. For as for saying mass and
herynge of confessyo^ and absolucyon theruppo^ to be given / all this he
sayethe that every man woman and child may do as well as any priest. Now does
hychen therefore to ^et forth this opinion wythall after his masters herysye
put a way the name of priest in his translacyone / as though prestehede
were not^yng. where so ever the scripture speaks of the prestys that were
among the Jews / there does he in his ^translacyon call them still by the
name of prestis. But where so ever ye scripture spek^th of the prestys of
Christis church / ther^ does he put away the name of pressed in his translacyo^
/ because he would make hit se^^e that the scripture did never speak of any
prestys dyfferent from ley men among christen people. And he says plainly in
his book of obedience that presthed and all holy orders among christian people be
but faynyd inue^tio^s / and that prestys be nothing but officers chosyn to
preche / and yt all ye consecration whereby they be consecrate is not hynge
worth. And for this cause i^ all his tra^slacyon where so ever he speaks of
the^ / the name of pr^est which to us in our own to^g has always sygnyfyed an
en^ynted person and with holy orders consecrated unto god / he has chaungede
in to the name of senyor no word of our language / but either used half in
mockage wha^ we speak french in sport / dieu vous guard senior / or at the
^erdest nothing betokenynge but elder. So that yt is ^the to se what he meant
in the turnynge of these namys. In good faith quod your friend it seems verily
yt he meant not well. Surely quod I ye would well say so if y^ saw all the
placys which I shall cause you to se when ye will / and ye shall soon judge
them your self. For yt were to long to rehearse them all now. Nor these have
I not rehearsed you as for ye cheef / but for yt they ca^ first to mind. For
ell^s I might shortly rehearse you many thyngys moo / as far owte of tewne as
these be. For he changes commonly the name of grace in to this word favor
/ where as every favor is not grace in english / for in su^ fa^our is there
little grace. Confessyone he traunslateth in to knowledgynge. Penance in to
repentance. A co^tryte heart he ^hau^geth i^ to a troubled heart. And many mo
thingis like / and many ^^rtys untruely trau^slated for ye mayn tenau^ce of
heresye as I shall show you same when we look in the book. which thyngis we
shall not now reason upon for they be not worthy to be brought i^ questyone.
But I tell you this much only for this cause / yt ye may pe^ceyue that he
has thus used him self in his translacyone / to thentent that he would set
forth luthers heresies and his own thereby. For first he would make ye people
believe yt we should believe nothing but plain scripture / in which point he
techeth a plain pestylent heresye. and then would he with his false tra^sla^yo^
make the people been ferther / yt such artycles of our faith as he laboreth to
destroy / and which be well proved by holy scripture / were in holy scripture
nothing spoken of / but yt ye prech^^s have all this xv.C. year myssreported
ye gospel and englyshed ye scripture wrong / to lead ye people purposely owte
of ye right way.

The.ix. chapyter.
The author shewethe a another great token that the translacio^ was peryllous /
and made for a^ evil purpose.

BUt to the^te^t ye shall yet ye less doubt what good ^ra^te was i^te^ded by
this tra^slacyo^ / and easyly judge your self whyther yt was well worthy to be
burned or not / ye shall understand yt there has be synnys ye time a another
book made in englysh and impryntyd as it says i^ Almayne / a folyshe railing
book against ye clergy and mich part made in time / but ye effect thereof was
all against ye mass and ye holy sacraments. In this book ye maker ^ayleth
upon all them yt caused Tyndals tra^slacyon of the new testament to be burned
/ sayng yt they burnyd it because yt yt destroyed the mass. whereby ye may see
that he rekenyd that translacyon very good for their purpose toward y^
destruccyo^ of the mass. By saint mary mass quod your friend that book is a
shrewd gloss for ye the other. For yt showed a cause for which yt was well worthy
to be burnyd and the maker with yt / if yt were made to destroy the mass. But
who made that second book? For so^^ q I yt appears not in the book. For the
book is put forth namelesse / and was in the beginning rekened to be made by
Tyndall. And whyther yt so were or not we be not yet very sure. ^ow be yt sith
that time Tindall has put owte in his own name a another book ^tytled Ma^mona
/ which book is ^er^ ma^mona iniquitatis / a very tresoury and well spring of
wyckednes. And yet has he sythens put forth a wor^ also named the obedyence
of a christian man / a book able to make a cryste^ man that would believe yt /
leave of all good christian virtues and lose the merit of his crystendom. In the
preface of his first book called Mammona he says y^ one frer^ ^^erome made ye
the other book that we talk of / which friar Syerome gyuyng up his order of the
friar obseruauntys came to him where he was / showing him that he would cast of
his abyte and leave his relygyon / and assaye now to serve god / and that
afterward he left him and wentte unto Roy / which is as I think ye know a
another appostyta / by wose counsale Tyndale says that the friar H^ero^e made
y^ book / wherein Tyndall says that he myslykyth his rymys / and his over
much raylynge. And sayethe also that he fereth lest friar Hyerome shall not
well prove all yt he promyseth in that book. why q your friend is yt all the
fere that he fyndeth in him self and all the fawte that he fyndeth in y^ friar
and his book? ye in good faith quod I every whytte. Tha^ fyndethe he q your
friend no faut in his apostasye. No more quod I than I show you. Nor finds
he quod your friend no fault in that the freres book says that the new
testament of Tyndall was burnid because it stroyed ye mass? Never a whytte q I
more than you here. And fereth he quod your friend no thing else but lest the
friar should ^ayle of performing of sum what yt his book promysythe That is all
quod I And what he promysyth therein I faith I remember not. But yt seems what
so ever yt be / Tyndall would yt were well performed. He had quod your friend
much more cause as me thi^keth to fere lest men should re^en high defaute in
his translacyon / in that he nothing answers to those wordys of the ^reres
book / wherein he says that y^ new testamente that was bur^yd did dystroy the
mass ye say quod I very troth in my mind / and so would he of lyklyhed if him
self had not mente as the friar said. But surely for the translacyon I shall
show you so many textes in such wise corruptede / that ye shall not I suppose
greatly doubt what he meant in his doing. And therewyth all I showed your
friend a book with y^ placys ready notyd / which book I had by license a little
before lent unto me for the no^ys. wherein he saw so many corrupcyo^s / and of
such manner sort / that albeyt upon some we somewhat resoned in the way / yet
at the last hy^ self said ho / and verily confessyd y^ the book in such wise
translated was very naught and nothing metely to be red.

The.x. chapyter.
The author shewyth yt ye tra^sla^^o^ of Tyndal was to bad to be me^ded.

BUt yet he said that the faw^^ might be by su^ good me^ ame^dyd / and than the
book prityd again if nothing let but y^. Surely quod I if we go thereto / the
fawtys be as ye se so many and so spread through the hole book / that like wise
as yt were as sone done to weue a new web of clothe as to sow up every hole
in a net / so were it almost as litell labor and le^^e to translate the hole
book all new / as to make in his translacyon so many chaungys as need mu^^e be
ere it were made good / besydys this that there would no wise man I trow take y^
bread which he well wist was of his enemies hand onis poisoned / though he saw
his friend after scrape it never so clean.

The.xi. chapyter.
The messenger fyndeth fawte with the clergy / in y^ he says they have made a
constytucyon prouyncyall y^ no bible in englysh should be suffered. And in this
chapyter incydently y^ messenger much reproves y^ living of the clergy.
Whereunto y^ author somewhat shows his mind / defferrynge for the while his
answer to thobye^^yon made against the constytucyon.

S^r quod your friend I will not gretely s^ykke with you in that point. But
surely the thing y^ makes in this matter the clergy most suspect / and wherein
as yt seems yt would be full hard to excuse them / is this / that they not
only d^^^ne Tyndals translacyon (wherein there is good cause) but ever that do
dampne all other / and a^ though a lay man were no christian m^n / will suffer no
ley man have any at all. But when they find any in his ^epyng / they lay
heresye to him therfo^e. And thervppon they burn up the book and sometime the
good man with all / alledgyng for the defense of their doing a law of their
own making a co^stytucyon pro^yncyal / where by they have prohybyted that any
man shall have any upon pain of heresye. And this is a law very prouyncyall /
for yt holds but here. For i^ all other cu^trees of chryste^dome the people
have the scripture translated i^to their own tongue / and the clergy th^re
fyndeth no ^^^he fawte therein. Wherefore either our people is worste of all
people / or else our clergy is wor^^e of all clergyes. But by my troth for
aught that I can se here or perc^yue by them that ha^^ been else where / our ley
people be as good and as (...) as be any (...) And if any be other wise /
thoccasyon and exemple comes of the clergy^/among whom we se myche more
vy^e tha^ among our self. Where as they should give us example of virtue and y^
light of lernyng / now their examples what they be we see. And as for learning
/ they neither will teache us but selde / and that shall be but such things as
pleases them some gloses of their own ma^yng / nor suffer us to learn by our
self / but by their constytucyo^ pull Crystys gospel out of christian peoples
handys. I can not well se why but left we should se the troth. The Jews be not
let to red their law both learned and lewd. And yet are there in the old
testament thyngys for unlearned folk far more strange and peryllous tha^ in
the new. And why should then ou^ ley men be forboden the gospel / but if they
will make us worse than Jews? Wherein I can in good faith se no scuse they can
find. For the scripture is to good folk y^ nouryssher of virtue / and to them
that be nauh^^ yt is the mean of amendment. And therefore while the clergy
does wyth^^^^^ it us / if our souls be in good health / they take a way
o^refode / if our souls be ^yke they take away y^ medycyne. And therefore as I
said the f^ut is not in y^ damnyng of Tyndals translacyo^ / but in that they
have by an express law forboden that we should have any at al Your wordys quod
I be somewhat poy^nau^t and sharp. But surely they pry^ somewhat more the men
th^n the matter. For where y^ towche in effect two thyngys / (...) the
constytucion pr^uyncyall by which yt think the clerg^^^^ (...) have evil
pro^^byted all (...) of sc^ypt^^^ in to our tongue / a another the vycys of ye
clergy in general / the first point which in deed towcheth our matter / I can
and will with few wordys answer you. But as for y^ other which touches the
men / as where ye accuse the clergy in their persons of very vycious living as
me^ much worse tha^ ye say that we be / and yet as though their own fautys
were to few / charge them with ours to / whereof ye call them the cause / in
this point will I keep no scolys with you / nor enter in to dyspycions thereof /
nor gladly meddle with the matter. For as I told you in the beginning sith we
talk but of mennys learning / I will not meddle of mennys living / nor in ye
treatyng of this matter either praise or dysprayse any ma^nys manner / except
some such as are for their heresies and evil doctrine cast out of Crystes
church / and through all Crystendome dampened and dy^famed all ready by their
own obstynate malice. But yet where ye speak of other contrees / making an
argument that our clergy is the worst of all other / I wot well y^ hole world
is so wreched that spyrytuall and temporal every where all be bad enough god
make us all better. But yet for yt I have my self seen / and by credyble folk
have herd / like as ye say by our temperalytye that we be as good and as
honest as any where else / so d^re I boldly say that the spyrytualytye of
england / and specially that p^rt^ in which ye find most fault / that is to
wit that part which we comenly call the secular clergy / is in learning
and honest living well able to m^che and (saving yt co^paryso^s be odyous I
would say ferther) far able to over m^tch^ number for number the spyrytu^lyte
of any nacyon christian. I wot well there be therein many very lewd and naught.
And surely where so ever there is a multitude / yt is not without miracle well
possible to be otherwise. But now if y^ bysshopys would onys take unto presthed
better ley me^ and fewer (for of us be they made) all the matter were more than
half amended. Now where ye say that ye se more vice in them th^n in our self
/ troth yt is that every thing in them is gretter / because they be more
bounden to be better. But else the thyngys that they mysdo / be y^ self same
that we sin in our self which vycys that as ye say we se more in the^ than
in our self / y^ cause is I suppose / for we look more upon theyrs tha^ on
our own / and fare as Esope says in a fable / that every man caryeth a dowbl^
walet on his sholder / and in to the tone that hangs at his breast he puts
other folkys fawtys / and theri^ he tooteth and poreth often / In the the other he
lays up all his own and swyngeth yt at his back / which him self never
lysteth to look in / but other that cu^ after him cast an eye in to yt among.
Would god we were all of the mind yt every man thought no man so badde as him
self. For yt were the way to mend both them and us. Now they blame us / and
we blame the^ / and both bl^me worthy / and either part more ready to find
others fawtys than to mende their own. For in reproach of the^ we be so
studyous / that neither good nor bad passes unreproved. If they be famylyer we
call them light. If they be solytary we call them fantastyke. If they be sad
we call them solemn. If they be merry we call them mad. If they be
cu^prynable we call them bycyouse. If they b^ holy we call them vpocrytys. If
they keep few seru^^^tys we call them nyggardys. If they keep many we call them
pompose. If a lewd^ priest do a lewd deed than we say / l^se what s^mple the
clergy gives us / as though that priest were ye clergy. But th^n forgete we
to look wh^t good men be theri^/and what good counsel they give us / and what
good example they sh^we us. But we fa^e as do the r^uens and the car^^ crowys
that never ^^dyll with any ^uycke flesh. But where they may find a deed
dog in a dyche / thereto they ^l^ and thereon they feed a pace. So where we se
a good man / and here or se a good thing / there we take little head. But when
we see onys an evil ^ede / thereon we gape / thereof we talk and feed our
self all day^ with the fylthy delight of evil co^munycacyo^^ Let a good man
preche / a short tale shall (...) a priest given light to the people that was
but very young. Mary quod I god forbede else / ye may se that often and ye
will. Trewly quod he yt is pytye that we see such light so selde / being
this wreched world in such darkness as yt is. For I never saw yt but onys.
Nor as yt semede few of the people n^yther. For in faith they wondered as
fast thereon as though they had never seen yt before. How happed that quod
I. Mary quod he yt happed that a young priest very deuoutel^ in a processyon /
bare a ^andell before the cross for lyenge wy^h a wenche / ^ bare yt light
all the long way. Wherein the people took such spyrytuall pleasure and
inward solace / that they lawhged a (...). And on^ merry marchaunte said unto
the prestys that followed him / (...) which fell in to the curse of his fa^^er
Noe / for that he m^de a g^^de and showed forth in skorne the secret members
of his father / that of adventure lay and slepte uncovered / which partys Sem
and Iaphet the blyssed chylderen ^^^^rently covered / going backward^ to him
because they would not se him. And surely we have little ^awse to lawghe at
their lewdness. For vndou^^y if the clergy be naught we must nedys be worse
/ as I herd ^nys master Colett the good deane of powlys preche. For he said
that yt can be none other / but that we must (...) be one degree under them.
For surely as he said yt can be no lie that our saviors ^aythe him self /
which says of them that they be salt of the earth. And y^ ^alte onys ap^lle
/ the world (...) were all known to go about and tell them by the pollys /
to se which side were the more. And therefore in the men while I trust in
god the better part is the gretter. How be yt y^ there were in deed among
them very few / yet think I verily that for those few all the world fa^^th
the better / and is in their ver^^^ and praye^ by goddys great mercy
^^^^^^yned and vpholden / as we find in scripture placys (...) one /
^^cla^ynge plainly the pro^^y^^ that an hole sinful (...) some time (...)
hole regyon / takes by the prayer of a few godly men. And no dow^^ is there
but like wise as he that is in the clergy^ nought^/is far the worse bycawse
he is therein / so he that therein is good / is for his clergy (...) far the
better / and his prayer to g^^ for him self and all other far the (...)

(...) goodness whereof his nowghtyn^^^^ can not appayre / that be he never so
vycyouse and therwyth so impenytent and so far from all purpose of
amendment / that his prayers were before the face of god rejected and abhorred
/ yet that sacred sacryfyce and sweet oblacyon of Crystys holy body offered
up by his office / can take none empayrynge by the fylthe of his sin / but
hyghly helps to the vpholdynge of this wretched world from the vengeance
of the wrath of god / and is to god as accep^able and to us as auaylable for
the thing yt self / as though yt were offered by a better man / though
pe^case his prayers joined therwyth neither much profytt other / nor the
oblacyon him self / as with whom god is the more gretely grieved / in that
being so badde he durst presume to towche yt. Mary quod your friend if this
be thus I marvel than why yt said right now that yt were good to make fewer
prestys / that they might be taken only of the better / and the worse refused.
For if their mas^^s be so good for us be them self never so nawght^/than
seems yt better for us to m^ke yet mo though they were yet worse / y^ we
might have mo mas^ys. That reason quod I will not hold. For though god of his
goodness how bad so ever the priest be / well accepts ye oblacyo^ of Crystys
holy body for other folk / yet is he with that prestys presumpcyon hyghly
dyscontented. And we never ought to seek our own co^mody^e with our neighbors
harm. And also we should of our dute to god / rather forbere ye profit yt our
self might attain by a mass / tha^ to se his majesty dysreuere^ced / by ye
bold presu^pcyon o^ of such an odyouse mynyster as he has forboden to come
about him. Like as if ye sent a psent unto a prince which were very pleasant
unto him / though y^ messenger much myslyked him so far yt he had be^ forboden
ye court / yet if ye were not ware thereof / your gift could not lose his tha^k
/ but his malepert boldenes might peradventure be punysshed and well were
worthy to be. But on ye the other side if ye knew the messenger for such as the
prince would not have come at him / ye would rather keep your present at home
and forbere the thank / than wyttyngly to send yt by such ^ menssenger / or
else though your present were very great / your thank would be very little.
And surely in like manner wise who so surely knows a priest to be nawght /
vycyouse / and in dedely dyspleasure of god / should get I think little thank
if he mad^ him say mass. And therefore well shall the prelatys do / as myche
as they may to provide / that god shall rather be more seldom presented with
the pleasant present of the mass / than more often offended with a
dyspleasaunte messenger. And verily were all the bysshoppes of my mind (as I
know some that be) ye should not of prestys have the plentye that y^ have. The
time has been when there were very few in a great city / and in a monastery
of five hundred in one house / scantely would there four monkys be bold to be
prestys. Than was all holy orders in high honor. Than find we that the
degree of a de^en was a great thing and of such dygnyte / that when one of the^
went sometime in pilgrimage / he would not be aknowen of his order / because
he would not that folk should do him worship in the way. But as for now a
days if he be de^^ and priest to / he shall need to fere no such pride / but
rather rebuke and vylany. which though yt have happened by the lack of virtue
among them / and decay of devotion among us / yet has myche of all this
gere grown by the mean of so great a number of prestys and so famylyer among
us. which thing nedys must mynysshe on our part reverence and estymacyon
toward them / which we never have but in thyngys rare and scarce. Gold would
we not set by if yt were as come^ as chalk or clay. And whereof is there now
such plenty as of prestys? In faith q he there is more ple^tie of prestys tha^
of good me^ / and there be to many but if they were better chosen. Doutlesse q I
there would be more dylyge^ce used in ye choice / not of their lernyng only /
but much more specially of their living. For with out virtue the better they
be learned ye worse they be / saving that lernyng is good store against god
send the^ grace to mende. Which else yt would be tha^ happily to late to look
for / specially if ye proverb were true that ye spoke of / that if a priest be
good than he is old. But this is a very suretye that yt is not well possible
to be without many very naught of that company / whereof there is such a maygne
multitude. The time was as I say / when few men durst presume to take upon
them the high office of a priest / not even wha^ they were chosen and called
there unto. Now ronneth every rascal and boldly offreth him self for able. And
where the dygnyte passes al pryncys / and they that lewd be / desires yt for
worldely winning / yet comes that sort thereto with such a made mind / that
they ^eken almoost god much bounden to them that they vouchesaufe to take yt.
But were I pope. By my soul quod he I would ye were / and my lady your wife
popesse to. Well q I than should she deuyse for nonnes. And as for me towchynge
the choice of prestys / I would not well deuyse better prouysyons than are by
the laws of the church provided all ready / if they were as well kept as they
be well made. But for the number / I would surely se such a way therein / that
we should not have such a rabell / yt every mean man must have a priest in
his house to wait upon his wife / which no man all most lacks now / to the
contempt of prestehed in as vile office as his horse keeper. That is quod he
troth in deed and in worse to / for they keep hawks and doggys. And yet me
seems surely a more honest service to wait on an horse than on a dog. And
yet I suppose if the laws of the church which Luther and Tyndall would have
all broken were all well observed and kept / this gere should not be thus / but
the nombre of prestys would be myche mynyss^ed and the remanau^t much the
better. For yt is by the laws of the church provided to the intent no priest
should unto the sclaunder of prestehedde be dreuen to live in such lewd manner
or worse / there should none be admytted unto prestehed / until he have a
tytell of a suffycyent yearly living / either of his own patrimony or other
wise. Nor at this day they be none otherwise accepted. Why quod he wherefore go
there tha^ so many of them a beggyng? Mary quod I for they delude the law and
the^ self also. For they never have gr^unt of a lyuyge that may serve them
in sight for ye purpose / but they secretly dyscharge yt ere they have yt / or
else they cowlde not get yt. And thus the bishop is blinded by the sight of
the writing / and the priest goth a beggyng for all his grant of a good
living / and the law is deluded / and the order is rebuked by the prestys
beggynge and lewd living / which either is feign to walk at rouers and live
upon trentalles or worse / or else to serve in a seculer ma^nys house / which
should not need if this gappe were stopped. For ye should have prestys few
enough if ye law were truly observed that none were made / but he that were
without colusyon sure of a living all ready. Than might yt h^p quod he yt ye
might have to few to serve the romys and lyuyngys yt be provided for them
except / the prelatys would provide that orders were not so comenly given / but
always receive in to orders as romys and lyuynges fall v^yde to bystowe them in
and no faster. ^^rely quod I for aught I se suddenly / that would not be myche
amys^e. For so should they need no such tytles at al nor should need neytheyr ron
at rouers / nor live in lay mennys howses / by reason whereof there grows
among no little corrupcyon in the prestys manners / by the conuersacyon of lay
people and company of women in their howses. Nay by our lady quod he I will
not agree with you therein. For I think they ca^ not lightly mete with much
worse company than them self / and that they rather corrupt us than we them.

The.xiii. chapyter.
The messenger moves yt yt would do well yt prestys should have wyuys whereunto
ye author makes answer.

BUt I would wene it would amend myth perte of this matter / if they might have
wyuys of their own Mary q I so says luther and Tyndal also / saving yt they
go su^what ferther forth. For Tyndall (whose bookys be nothing else i^ effect
but ye worst heresies pyked out of Luthers workys / and Luthers worst words
translated by Tyndall / and put forth in Tyndals own name) does in his fra^tyke
book of obedience (wherein he rayleth at large against all popes / against all
kings against all prelatys / all pres^es / all relygyous / all the laws / all
the sayntys / against the sacrame^tys of Crystes church / al against virtuous
workys / against all dyuyne service / and finally against all thing in effect
ye good is) in that book I say Tyndal holds ye prestes must have wy^ys. And
yt he groundeth wisely upon ye wordys of saint Poule / where he writes to
Thimotheus / Oportet episcopum esse irreprehensibilem vnius vxo^is viru^. That
a bishop must be a man unreprovable / and ye husband of one wife. And that
yt must be considered whether he have well brought up his children / and well
governed his household. By these wordys does Tyndall after Luther conclude for
a plain matter / that prestys must nedys have wy^es / and that saint Poule would
there should in no wise be none other prestys but married folk. Is yt not now a
wonder with what spectacles Luther and Tyndall have spyed this thing now in
these wordys of saint Powle. In which of so many great connyng^ ^^thers and
holy sayntys as have often read / and depely co^sydered those wordys before /
there was never none that had either the wit or the grace to perceive that
great specyal commandment this.xv.C. year / till now ye god has at last by
reuelacyo^ showed this high secret mystery to these.ii. goodly creatures
Luther and Tyndall / lest that holy friar should have lost his marriage of that
holy nonne / and Tyndall some good marriage that I think him toward. Tyndal
nothing answers in his book to that point / but ro^neth and rayleth over
without reason / and says that the scripture is plain therein for him. And ever
he passes over as thouh he herd it not that all the holy doctors that ever
were in Crystes church / sayen that the scripture which he alleges to be very
plain for him / is very plain against him as it is in deed. For saint poule in
that place / for as much as yet at that time except none but young me^ should
have be^ prestes / which he thought not comenly conuenyent / else could they
make no prestys then / but such as either were or had been married / therefore
thappostle having in the choice of prestys a special respect to chastyte /
and wyllyng to go as ^ere to no wife as might be / did ordain as god had
instructed him / that who so ever should be admytted to presth^d / should be the
husband of one wife. Meaning such as then had or before had had no mo but one
/ and that never had had twayn. He meaned not as mad Luther and Tyndall would
now make the world so ^^d to believe that a pressed must nedys have one / nor that
he may never lac^e one / nor yt he may have one after a nothe^/^or the only
forbyddyn^ of twain at onys / but he meant only that non should be admytted to
presthed but only such a man as never had had nor should have but only one.
which is the thing yt ever was and has been by those wordys understood.
And not only where saint Powle taught / but also through crystendome / where
the other apostles planted the faith / has yt ever ben so observed. Which is a
plain proof that concerning the prohybycyon / of any mo wyuys then one / and
the forbydi^g of bygamy by ye weddyng of one wife after a another / was the
special ordinance of god / and of saint Powle. whose epystles wherein he
writes any thing of this matter / was peradventure not comen to the handys of
other apostles / when they took yet the same order by the same spyryte that
taught yt him. For this is certain that ever and every where in crystendom the
bygamy of two wives each after other / has been a let and impedyment against
the the taking of holy orders / and has of long time ben a let / though the
^one wife had been married and buried before the mannys baptysme. And now these
two wise men against the old holy fathers and connyng doctors / and against
ye co^tynuall custume of Crystes church so many hundred years bygo^ne / and
continued by the spyryte of god / have spyed at last ye saint Powle says and
means that a priest may marye ^wyse and have one wife after a another and
that he must so have. For by Tyndall a pressed must ever have one wife at ye
lest. And surely if we leave ye true vnd^^standyng of saint Powlys words and
believe Tyndall / that yt is there meant and commanded because of this word
(...)/that a pressed must have one / then may Tyndall as for ye place tell us
that a pressed is at lybertye to have twain at onys or twentye and he will /
bycawse saint Powle says no more but that the bishop must be the husband of
one wife. Which wordys Tyndall may tell us be veryfyed / if he be ye husband
of.x. wyuys. For ye husband of.x. wyuys were ye husband of one / as ye father
of ten children is ye father of one / if ye wyuys were as co^patyble as ye
children be / as it is no dout but Luther and Tyndall would sone make the^ by
scripture / if their own interpetacyo^ may be taken for authoryte / against
the perceiving that god has given to all good christian people this.xv.C. year
Now as I say upon Tyndals taking saint Poule should men^^ not that a priest
should have b^t one wife (for yt but is not ^ ^ai^t Powles wo^des) but he
should mean yt a priest must have one at the le^^e / as though saint Poule had
lever yt ye priest had.xx. sa^e for ouercharging. Yet yt seems that Tyndall so
take yt in deed / and that a priest might have diverse wives at onys / specially
for the great reason that he sets thereto. For where as saint Poule sith
there was at that ^yme little choice to make prestes of but married men / wylled
therefore that in the choice of the bishop there should be considered how he
had governed his own howsehold / because he that had mystatched his wife and
his children / were unmeet for a great cure / therefore says Tyndal that never
should there any pressed be made / but but such as has a wife and children and by
the governance of them showed / yt he is mete to bear a rule / as though we
never saw any man that never had wife / govern an household better th^^ many
that have had five. And if the having and good rulyng of a wife be so special
a proof of a man mete to be a priest as Tyndall takes yt / then sith saint
Powle after Tyndals interpretacyon can not appear to forbede the having of
diverse wives together / best were yt after Tyndall specially to make that man a
pressed that had many wives and all at onys / and many children by each of them
/ if he guide the^ all well. For more proof is it of a wise gouernoure to rule
well five wives / than one / and forty children then four. But now that every
child may se the wysdom of Tyndall and his master Luther in the construccyo^
of holy scripture / whereof he speaks so myche and understands so little / I
beseech you consyderlyke wordys of saint Powle in a myche like matter. Saint
Powle as he writes to Thimotheus that a bishop must be ye husband of one wife
/ so writes he also to him / yt no wydow should be specially chosen and taken
in to be founde^ of ye goods of the church that were younger then.lx. year /
and yt she should be one that had been the wife of one husband. Now set these
two ^e^^ys together of the bishop and the wydowe / and consider the wordys of
one wife in the tone / and one husband in the the other / if we shall after Tyndal
take the tone wordys for the bishop / yt saint Powle should mean not that he
have or have had but one wife / but yt he must nedys have one wife / than must
we likewise take the words spoken by saint Powle of the wydowe / as though
saint Powle should mean not a wydowe which had never had mo than one husband
/ but a wydow yt had had one husband / as though saint Poule had nothing fered
nor forbode / but lest Timotheus should take in such a wydow as never had no
husband at all. Were not this wisely construed? Now if Tyndall will agree as
he nedys must but if he be mad / that saint Powle in gyuyng co^m^undeme^t that
the wydow should be such as had had one husband / meant thereby such one as
never had had mo than one / the^ must he nedys grant and his master Luther
to / that saint Powle in likewise where he said that a bishop must be a good
man and ye husband of one wife / meant that he must never have nor have had any
mo than one. And not that he must nedys have one / or that he must have one at
the least / and might have many mo than one / either each after other or all
together and he list. And in this matter has Tyndall no shyfte^ For sithe this
word one in one wife and one husband / was not by saynt^ Poule set in for
naught. It must needs sygnyfye either that there should be no mo but one / or
that there should be one at the lest. If he should mean that a bishop should
have one wife at the le^te / and that the wydowe should have had one husband
at the least / than would he rather that they should have mo than so few /
which every man sees how folysshe that construccyon is. Now if Tyndall will
say that by this word one / saint Powle meant there should be but one wife at
onys and one husband at onys / tha^ did saint Powle so speak of the bishop as
though he had said / a bishop must be a good man and have but one wife at
ones. In which words Tyndall had lost his purpose. For so were only a
prohybycyon for any mo than one / and no commandment but a bare permyssyon
for one. And yet were yt little to purpose / for in saint Poulys days a lay
man had but one wife at onys. And the folly of this construccyon appears in the
wordys spoken of saint Poule in ye choice of the wydow / wherein Tyndall would
by this way make saint Poule to say thus. Take and ^hese in but such a wydow
as has had but one husband at onys / as though the gyse were in his days
that wyuys might have two husbandys at onys. In faith quod your friend I think
saint Powle meant not so. For the^ had wyuys ben in his time little better tha^
grass wydowes be now. For they be yet as several as a barbours chair / and
never take but one at ones. In faith quod I the folly of such folk does well
appear that seek in ye scripture of god such new construccyons against the
very sense that god has this.xv.C. year so taught his hole church / that
never was there pope so coueytous yet ye durst dyspence in this point / seeing
the consent of Crystys church so full and hole there in / and the mind of
saint Poule so clear to suffer only one with utter exclusyon of any mo than
one / y^ who so ever would constrew him other wise / must nedys fall in to such
open folyes as Tyndall and Luther do. And thus ye se how substauncyally Tyndal
and his master construe the scripture / and with what authoryte they conferm^
this noble new doctryn^ of theyrs / b^ which they would co^dempne all Cryste^dom
as brekers of the law of god / as long as they suffer not any priest take a
wife / or rather as long as they suffer him to be without a wife. For wives
they must nedys have by Tyndals tale whyther they will or no. By my troth quod
your friend if Tyndall and Luther have none other hold tha^ that place of
saint poule / they be lykely to take a fall. But I think they say more tha^
that. Surely quod I Tyndall has a another reason in deed. He says that
chastyte is an excedi^g seledome gift / and vnchastyte excedyng perylous for
that estate. And thereon he concludes that prestys must needs have wives. But
now what if a man would deny him though chastyte be a great gift / yt yet yt
is a seledome gift. For though yt be rare and seledome in respect of ye
remanau^te of the people that have yt not / yet is yt not seledome in deed /
for many men have yt. And Christ says ye al me^ take it not / but he says not
that no man takes yt / nor that few men take yt. And hyghly he co^me^deth
them that for his sake do take yt. What inco^uenyence is yt than to take in to
his special service men of that sort that he most specially commends? Or
if we granted to Tyndal that few men can live chaste / which is plain false
(for many has done and does) but now if we did I say grant him yt thing /
though he might peradventure thervpo^ conclude / yt there should not be so many
prestys made and bounden to chastyte as could not live chaste / yet could he
not conclude as he now concludes / that no priest should be suffered to live
chaste / but that every priest must needs have a wife. For this is his
argument. Few me^ ca^ live chaste / ergo every pressed must take a wife. If we
should impugn the fourm^ of this argument / Tyndall would rail and say we
meddle with sophystrye / and wise men would say we were Idely occupied to
labor to show that folly ye so euydently shows yt self. And therefore we
shall let hi^ wise argument alone / sith yt su^^yseth us that every man yt any
wit has / may well se that upon his unreasonable reason / one of two
thyngis must needs follow / either y^ Christ in commendyng perpetual chastyte
/ did commend a thing not co^me^dable / or else if every pressed must nedys
have a wife / tha^ were yt not laufull to make a pressed of that sort yt is of
gods own mouth commended. Surely quod your friend me think they go far
therein to say ye prestis must needs have wives. But me think that this they
might well say and I to / that yt is not well done to bind them with a law /
that they shall have none / but yt may be well done to suffer them have wives
that would as they have in walys. And I here say that in Allmaygne they find
great case therein. For like as here the good wife keeps her husband from her
maydys / so there the persons wife keeps her husband from all the wyuys in the
pary^he. As for walys quod I ye be wrong informed / for wyuysha^e they not.
But troth yt is ye inco^ty^e^te is there in some place little looked unto /
whereof my^he harm grows in ye cuntrye. And as for Allmaygne such part
thereof as that is used in / which is only where Luthers sect is received /
who so consider well what co^modyte has cu^men to them by such ungodly ways
/ I think shall have no great fantysye to follow them. Well quod he let
Walys and Allmaygne go / yet prestes had wyuys of old when they were better
tha^ they be now. And yet have in greece where they be better than they be here.
As for the prestys of gre^e I will not dysprayse them quod I / for I know
them not. But somewhat was not well there / that god has suff^ed all that
empire to fall in to hethen mennys hands. And yet be they not there so lose as
ye teken them. For though a wedded man taken there in to the clergy be not
nor can be put from his wife / but is there suffered to mynyster in the office
of a priest not wtstandynge his marriage / yet if he be unmarried at the time
that he takes prestehed / be than professes perpetual contynence / and never
maryeth after / as I have learned by such as have comen from thense. Now where
ye speak of old time / surely ye shall understand that there married not so
many as y^ would happily wene. Peradventure quod he no more there would now. Some
of the^ would have no wyuys though y^ law were set at large. For as a good fellow
said onys to his frendys ye mer^ayled why he married not / and thought him
unnatural if he cared not for y^ company of a woman / he said unto the^ yt he
had lever lose a finger tha^ lack a woman. But he had lever lack ye hole hand
tha^ have a wife. So if ye prestys were at lybertye / some of ye worst sort
would yet I wene rather have women tha^ wives. But other that would be more
honest / would I suppose be married. And yet would some peradventure live in
perpetual contynence as few do now. God forbede q I. Well q he they y^ would /
were not restrained. But if I shall be bold to say what I thyn^/it seems me
surely a very hard thing yt ye church should make a law to bind a ^ man to
chastyte magry his te^he / to which god would never bynd^ any man. The church
quod I byndeth no man to chastyte. That is troth q he except a priest be a
man. ye mysse take the matter quod I as I shall show you after. There would quod
he many ha^mys be avoided / and myche good would there grow thereof / if they
might have wyuys that would. What good or harm quod I would come thereof the
proof would show / wherein we might be the more bold to trust well / were yt
not that we now find yt naught in Saxony where we newly se yt assayed. And as
for that ye spoke of old time when the prestys were better / surely as I would
if ye had not stopped me have said ferther before. we perceive well by the
writers of old time / that of those good men very few were married. And none in
effect after that office taken. And many such as had wyuys before / wyllyngly
with their wyuys ass^nte forbate the carnal use of them. And sith the good
or harm growing of the matter best apper^th by the proof / beside
thexperyence that we have now in Saxony where this change is bygonne with an
infynyte hepe of heresies / yt is ethe to see that the good fathers which gave
their aduyce to the maky^ge of that law / with the thing almost received in
general custom before / and with the consent of all crystendome in effect
that ratefyed and received yt after / had a good proof thereof / and fownde
this the be^te way before the law made / and there fore I will not dyspute
with you therevppon. But for as myche as ye lay unreasonableness to their
charge that made yt / bycawse they bynd men as ye ^eken against their will to
chastyte / somewhat were yt that ye say / if the church compelled any man to
be priest. But now wha^ (...)ry man ^s at his lyb^^te not to be pressed bu^ at
this pleasure / (...) can any (...) say that the church lays a b^^^nde of
chastyte in any mannysn^^^^ against his will? The church does in effect (...)
ferther but prouyd^/that where as m^^ will of their own myndys some live ch^st
and some will not / the myny^^^^^ of the sacrament shall be taken of that sort
only / that will be content to pr^^fes^^ chastyte. Wherwyth wh^so fyndeth fawt
/ blames not only the clergy but also the temp^ralyte / which be and have been all this while (...) in the auth^ryte of the (...) and conser^acyon of this
l^we. (...) of there can no m^n bla^e the (...)syo^ / but if he be tyth^^in
that (...) y^ he think that the (...) is no more pleas^unte to g^^ (...) the
prestys of the temple for the tym^ of their mynystracyon for^^re their own
h^use and the company of their wy^ys. And therefore they s^r^^d the temple by
course / as yt well app^reth in the beginning of saint Lu^ys gospel. So y^
ch^styte was thought both to god and man a thing m^^e and co^uenye^t for
prestys / amon^ the^ which most magnyfyed carnal generacyon. And th^n how
myche more specially now to ye pre^^ys of Christ / which was b^the borne of a
vyrgyn / and lived ^ dyed^ ^^rgyn him self / and exhor^ed all his to the same?
whose counsayl i^ that point ^ythe some be content to follow and (...) to live
otherwise / wh^t w^y were I say more metely th^n to take in to Crystys temple
to serve about the sacr^^ent / only such as be of that s^r^^ that ar^ content
and minded to (...) order of the church therein be better tha^ the contrary /
good men and wise me^ both had the proof of both before the law made / and
yt well allowed through crystendom long time synnys. Which ere I would assent to
change / I would se a better author thereof / than such an heretyque as Luther /
and Tyndall / and a better sample than the sedycyous and scysmatyque prestys of
Saxony. Surely quod he ye have well declared the church towchyng that law. But
what so ever ye cause be / by my troth naught they be / and as far worse
than we / as they be bounde^ to be better / and yet be we the worse for them.
There be quod I many right good among the^ / and else were yt wrong^ with us.
And many be there bad also / and some the worse for us. But whyther part is
the better or the worse / will I not dyspute. But this will I say that yt were
best that they thought them self the worse / and we our self / and every man
him self (...). I would that we were all in (...) with our own ^^^tys as my
father says that we (...) with our wyuys. For when (...) folk blame wyuy^
and say that the^^ be so many of them shrewes / he says that they dy^^ame
the^ falsely. For he says plainly that there is but one ^^^ewde wife in ye
world / but he says in deed that every man weneth he has been / and that ye
(...) is his own. So would I feign that ^u^ry man would wene there were (...)
one man na^ght in all ye hole (...) and that (...) him self. And that he would
thervppo^ ^o about to (...) that one^ and th^^ would all (...). ^hych t^^ng we
should shortly (...) if we would (...) our w^le^/that I told you of / and the
^^gge with other folkys fawtys cast at our ba^ke / and cast the bag yt bears
our own fawtys cast yt onys by^^^e us at our breast. It would be a goodly
brooche for us to look on ou^e own fawtys a another while. And I dare boldly
say / both they and we should much the better amend / if we were so ready each
to pray for other / as we be ready to seek each others reproach and rebuke. In
faith quod he I trow that b^ ^^ue and pray god we so may.

The.xiiii. chapyter.
The author answers the dou^e moved before in the.xi. chapyter / concerning
the constytucyon prouyncyall / and that the clergy is therein (...) fro the
f^^t that is imputed to ^^eym ^n that point / showing also ^^at the clergy
has not forboden (...) bible to be made and read in (...).

(...) virtuous and well learned men translated in to thenglysh tongue / and by
good and godly people with devotion and sobernes well and reverently red / took
upon him of a malycyouse purpose to translate yt of new. In which translacyon
he purposely corrupted that holy text / malycyously pla^tyng therein such
wordys / as might in the reders erys serve to the proof of such heresies as
he went about to sow / which he not only set forth with his own translacyon
of ye bible / but also with certain prologes and glosys which he made
thervppo^. And these thyngys he so handeled (which was no great maystrye) wy^h
reasons probable and lykely to lay people and unlearned / yt he corrupted in his
time many folk in this reame. And by other ill bokys which he made in laten
being after borne in to Boheme and there taught by John^ Husse and other / he
was thoccasyon of the utter subuersyon of that hole reame both in faith and
good living / with the loss also of many a thousand lyuys. And as he began
again ye old heresies of those ancient heretyques whom and whose errors the
church of Christ had condemned and subdued many diverse agys before / so does
Luther again begin to set up his. For all that he has in effect / he has
of him. Saving that lest he should seem to say nothing of his own / he added
some things of him self of such manner sort / as there was never heretyque
before his days / neither so wicked that he would for sin / nor so folish yt
he durst for shame write / say / or I trow thynk ye like. I long quod he to
bear some of them / for y^ man is taken for wyser tha^ to mean so madly as men
bear him in hand. Well quod I that shall we se sone when we come thereto. Bu for
our present purpose / after that yt was perceived what harm y^ people took by
the translacyon / prologys and glosys of Wyclyff^/and also of some other that
after him help to set forth his sect / tha^ for ye cause / and for as myche
as yt is daungerouse to translate the text of scripture out of one tongue in
to a another as holy saint Hierom testyfyeth / for as myche as in tra^slacio^ it
is hard alwai to keep ye same sentence hole^yt was I say for these causys at a
counsel holden at Oxenford / provided upon great pain that no man should from
thense forth translate in to th^nglysh tongue or any other langage of his own
authoryte^by way of book / lybell / or tretyce / nor no man openly or secretly
any such book / lybel / or tretyce read newly made in the time of the said
Johan wyclyffe or synnys / or yt should be made any time after / till the same
translacyo^ were by the dyocesane / or if need should so require by a
prouyncyall counsayl approved. And this is the law yt so many so long have
spoken of / and so few have in all ye while rought to seek whyther they say
troth or no. For I trow yt in this law ye se no thing unreasonable. For yt
neither forbedeth ye tra^slacio^s to be red yt were all ready well done of old
before Wyclyffys days / nor da^pneth his because yt was new / but because yt
was naught / nor prohybyteth new to be made / but prouydeth yt they shall not
be read if they be mysse made / till they be by good examinacio^ amended /
except they be such tra^slacio^s as wyclyf made and Ti^dal / yt ye malicyous
mind of ye tra^slator had in such wise handled it as it were labor lost to go
about to me^d the^ I long by my troth quod he and even sit on thorns / till
I se that constytucyo^. For not my self only but every man else has ever
taken yt far otherwise / that ever I have herd spoken thereof till now. But
surely I will se yt my self ere I sleep. Ye shall be sooner eased q I. For I
can not suffer to se you sit so long on thorns. And therefore ye shall se yt by
and by.

And therwyth I fet him forth the constytucyons prouyncyall with lynwood
thervppon / and tornyd him to the place in ye title de magistris. which when
him self had read / he said he maruayled mich how it happened that in so
plain a matter men be ^o far abused / to report yt so far wrong. This
grows quod I partly by malice / partly by slouthe and negligence / in ye
folk be more glad to believe and tell forth a thing that may sown to the
dysprayse of the clergy / tha^ to search and be sure whyther they say true or
no.

The.xv. chapyter.
The messenger moves against ye clergy / yt though they have made no law
thereof / yet they will in deed suffer non englysh bible in no man's hand / but
use to burn them where they find them / and sometime to to burn the man to.
And for ensample he lays one Rychard hu^ne / showing that the chau^celer of
London murdered him in prison and after hanged him / faynyng yt he hanged him
self / and after condemned him of heresye / because he had an english bible /
and so burned y^ bible and him together whereunto ye author a^swereth I Suppose
quod he that this opinion is rather grown another way / that is to wit by
the reason yt the clergy though the law serve them not therefore / do yet in
deed take all tra^slacyons out of every lay man's hand. And sometime with
those that be burned or co^uycted of heresye / they burn ye englysh bible
without respect / be ye translacyon old or new / bad or good. Forsooth quod I
if this were so / tha^ were yt in my mind not well done. But I believe ye
mystake yt. How be yt what ye have seen I can not say. But my self have seen
and can show you byblys fair and old written in english / which have been
known and seen by the bishop of the dyocyse / and left in lay mennys handys
and women's to such as he knew for good and catholyke folk / that used yt with
devotion and sobernes. But of troth all such as are founden in the handys of
heretyques / they use to take away But they do cawse none to be burned as
far as ever I cowlde wit / but only such as be founde^ fawtye. Where of
many be set forth with evil prologys or glosys malycyously made by wyclyf and
other heretykes. For no good man would I wene be so mad to burn up ye bible /
wheri^ they found no faut / nor on law yt let yt to be looked on and red.
Mary quod he but I have herd good men say that even here in London not many
yerys agoo / in the days of the bishop that last dyed / they burned up as
fair bybles in englysh as any man has lyghly seen / and thereto as fautlesse
for awght that any man cowlde find / as any bible is in laten. And yet bysydys
this they burned up the deed body of the man him self / whom them self
had hanged in the byshoppys prison before / making as though ye man had
hanged himself. And of the burning of his body had they no color / but only
because they found english bybles in his house. Wherein they never found
other faut / but because they were englyssh. who told you this tale quod I?
Forsothe diverse honest me^ quod he that saw yt / and special one that saw the
man hangyng in ye bishops prison ere he was cut down. And he told me yt yt
was well and clearly proved / yt the chaunceler and his kepers had killed the
man first / and tha^ hanged him after. And that they had laid heresye to him
only for hatred yt he sued a pmunyre against diverse persons / for a suyt taken
about a mortuary in the audyence of the archebysshop of canterbury. And tha^
they proved the heresye by nothing else / but by the possessyon of a good
englysh bible. And upon heresye so proved against him whom they had hanged /
lest he should say for him self / they burned up the holy scripture of god
/ and the body of a good man therwyth. For I have herd him called a very honest
person and of a good substance. Forsothe quod I of good substance he was I
think well worth a. M. markys. And of his worldly conuersacyon among the
people I have herd non harm. But surely as towchynge his faith toward Christ /
me thinks I may be bold to say that he was not honest. And as touching troth
i^ words / he yt has told you this tale was not so honest in deed as me
thinks ye take him for. Why q he do ye know ye matter well? Forsooth q I so well
I know it from top to too / yt I suppose there be not very many me^ yt know yt
much better. For I have not only ben diverse times present my self at certain
examynacyons thereof / but have also diverse and many times sunderly talked with
almost all such except the ded man him self / as most knew of the matter. which
matter was many times in sundry placys examyned. But specially at Baynardys
castle one day was yt examyned at great length / and by a long time every man
being sent for before / and ready there all yt could be founden yt any thing
could tell or yt had said they could any thing tell in the matter. And this
examynacyo^ was had before diverse great lordys spyrytual and temporal and
other of the kyngys honorable counsayll / sent thither by his highness for
the nonys of his blyssed zele and pryncely desire borne to the searching of the
truth. Whereunto his gracyous mind was myche enclyned / and had been by a
right honorable man informed / that there was one had showed a friend of his yt
he could go take him by the sleue yt killed Hu^ne / for Rychard hu^ne was his
name whom ye speak of. I was also my self psent at the judgment given in
Powlys / where upon his bokys and his body were burned. And by all these
thyngys I very well know / that he of whom ye have h^rd this matter / has
told you talys far from ye troth. In good faith q your friend / he told me
one thing yt ye speak of now / that there was one that said he cowlde go
take him by the sleue that killed Hunne / and that he did so in deed before the
lordys / and came even there to the chaunceler and said my lordys this is he.
But wha^ he was asked how he knew it / he confessed yt yt was by such and
unlawful craft (...) was not taken for a proof. For it was they say by
necroma^cie And the bishops yt were there would have had y^ man burned to for
wychecrafte. And told me also yt there was a another which had seen meny men yt
had hanged the^ self / a man that had be^ long in office under diverse of the
kyngys almoygners / to whom ye goodys of such men as killed them self be
appointed by ye law / and his office / as deodandes to be given in almoyse This
man as I have herd say / showed unto the lordys by such experyence as he had
good and plain tokens / by which they perceived well that Hunne did never
hang him self. I have herd also that a spyrytuall man and one that loved well
the chaunceler / and was a laborer for that part / yet could not deny before
all the lordys but that he had told a temporal man and a friend of his /
that Hunne had never ben accused of heresye if he had never sued the premunyre.
And by saint Mary that was a shrewd word. How be yt in deed yt went not so
nere the matter as the the other two thyngys did. Yes in good faith quod I all
three like nere when they were all herd. But of troth many other thyngys were
there laid / that upon the herynge seemed myche more suspycyouse than these.
Which yet when they were answered / always lost more than half their
strength. But as for these three matters I promise you proved very tryfles / and
such as if ye had herd them ye would have lawghed at them seven year after. I
beseech you quod he let me here how they proved. I am loathe quod I to let
you and lose your time in such tryfles. How be yt sithe ye long so sore
therefore / rather than ye sh^lde lose your child for them / ye shall have
them all three as shortly as I can. First ye must understand that bycawse
the coming together of the lordys from Grenewych to Baynardes castle for the
tryenge out of the matter should not be frustrate / there was such dylygence
done before / that every man that aughte had said therein / was ready there
against their coming. where they began with the first point that ye spoke
of / as the special mocyon whervppon the kyngys highness had sent them
thither. Wherefore after the rehersall made of the cause of their coming / the
grettest temporal lord there present said unto a certain servant of his own
sta^dyng there bysyde / sir ye told me ye one showed you that he could go take
him by ye sleue yt killed Hu^ne^ have ye brought him hither? Sir q he if yt
like your lordshyp this man yt was y^ told me so / poyntyng to one that he had
caused to come thither. Than my lord asked that man how say ye sir can ye do
as ye said ye could? Forsothe my lord quod he and yt like your lordsshyp I
said not so myche / this gentylman did somewhat mys^e take me. But in deed I
told him that I had a neighbor that told me that he cowlde do yt. Where is
that neighbor quod my lord? This man sir quod he / bringing forth one
which had also be warned to be there. Than was he asked whyther he had said
that he could do yt. Nay forsothe quod he my lord I said not that I cowlde do
yt my self / but I said y^ one told me that he could do yt. Well q my lord who
told you so? Forsothe my lord quod he my neighbor here. Tha^ was ye man
asked. Sir know you one that can tell who killed Hunne? Forsooth quod he and yt
like your lordshyppe I said not that I knew one surely yt could tell who h^d
killed him / but I said in deed that I know one which I thought verily could
tell who killed him. Well quod the lords at last yet with much work we come
to so^what. but whereby thyn^ you yt he can tell? Nay forsooth my lord q he yt is
a woman / I would she were here with your lordshyppis now. Well q my lord woman
or man all is one / she shall be had where so ever she be. By my faith my
lords q he and she were with you she would tell you wonders. For by god I have
wist her tell many maruylouse things ere now. Why q ye lordis what have you
herd her told? For so^h my lords quod he if a thing h^d been stolen / she
would have told who h^d yt / and therefore I think she could as well tell who
kyld Hunne as who stale an horse. Surely said the lordys so think all we to I
trow. But how could she tell yt by the devil? Nay by my troth I trow quod he
/ for I could never se her use any worse way than lokyng in onys hand.
Therwyth the lordys laughed and asked what is she. Forsooth my lord quod he an
egyp^yan / and she was lodged even here at Lambeth / but she is gone over see
now. How be it I trow she be not i^ her own country / yet for they say yt is
a great way hense / and she went over little more than a month ago. Now
forsooth q your friend this process came to a wise purpose / here was a great
post well thywted to a puddyng pryk. But I pray you to what point came the
second matter of him that had been in office under so many of the kyngys
almoygners / that he knew by his own experye^ce and proved y^ Hu^ne h^d not
hanged him self? Forsooth q I he was called in next. And than was he asked
whereby he knew yt. But would god ye had seen his contenau^ce. The man had of
lykelyhed said su^what to far and was myche amassed / and looked as though his
eyes would have fallen out of his head in to the lordys lappys. But to ye
questyo^ he answered and said / yt he saw y^ very well / for he saw him both
ere he was taken down and after. What than q ye lordys so did there many mo /
which yet upon the sight could not tell that. No my lordys quod he but I have a
another in sight insuche things tha^ other men have. What in syghte quod they?
Forsooth q he yt is not unknown yt I have occupied a great while under diverse
of ye kyngys almoygnyers / and have seen and considered many that have hanged
the^ self / and thereby if I se one hang I can tell anon whyther he hanged him
self or not. By what toke^ can you tell quod the lordys? Forsothe quod he I can
not tell ye tokens / but I perceive yt well enough by mine own syghte. But
when they herd him speak of his own syghte / and therwyth saw what sight he
had / lokynge as though his eyes would have fallen in their lappes / there
could few forbere laughing / and said we se well surely that ye have a syghte
by your self. And than said one lord meryly / peradventure as ^om man is s^
cu^nyng by experye^ce of jewels that he can perceive by his own eye why^^er a
stone be right or counterf^te though^ he can not well make a another man to
perceive the tokens / so this good fellow thowghe he can not tell us the markys
/ yet has such an experyence in hangyng / that himself perceyueth upon the
sight / whyther the man hanged him self or no. Ye forsothe my lord quod he
ever as your lordysshyp says. For I know yt well enough my self / I have seen
so many by reason of mine office. Why quod a another lord meryly your office
has no more experyence in hangyng than has an hang man. And yet he can not
tell. Nay sir q he and yt like your lordshyp he medleth not with them that
hang them self as I do. Well q one of the lordys how many of them have ye
meddled with in your days? With many my lord quod he / for I have been offycer
under two almoygners and therefore I have seen many. How many quod one of the
lordys? I can not tell quod he how many / but I wot well I have seen many.
Have ye seen quod one an hundred? Nay quod he not an hundred. Have ye seen
four score and ten? thereat a little he studied as one standing in a doubt and
that were loath to lie and at last he said / that he thought nay not fully
four score and ten. Than was he asked whither he has seen twenty. And thereto
without any styckynge he answered nay not twenty. Thereat ye lordys lawhged well
to se that he was so sure that he had not seen twentye / and was in dout
whyther he had seen four score and ten. Than was he asked why there he had
seen.xv. And thereto he said shortly nay / And in likewise of ten. And last
they came to five / and fro five to four. And there he bygan to study again.
Tha^ came they to three / and tha^ for shame he was fayn to say yt he had seen so
many and mo to. But wha^ he was asked / wha^ / whom / and in what place /
necestyte drove him at last unto y^ troth / whereby yt appeared that he never
had seen but one in all his life. And that was an yrysh fellow called croke
shank whom he had seen hanging in an old bar^e. And wha^ all his connyng
was come to this / he was bad walk like him self. And one said unto him that
bycawse he was not yet co^nynge enough in the craft of hanging / y^ was
pytye that he had no more experyence thereof by one mo. Forsothe q your
friend this was a mad fellow. Came ye third tale to as wise a point? Ye shall
here quod I. The temporal man that had reported yt upon ye mouth of the
spyrytual man / was a good worshypfull man / and for his truth and worship
was in great credyte. And surely the spyrytuall man was a man of worship also /
and well known both for co^nyng and virtuous. And therefore ye lords myche
meruayled knowi^g the^ both for such as they were / that they should be like to
find / either the tone or the the other either make an untrue report or
untruely deny ye troth. And first the temporal man before the lordys in the
heryng of the spyrytuall person sta^dyng by / said / my lordys as help me god
and halydom master doctor here said unto me his own mouth / that if Hu^ne
had not sued the premunyre he should never have be^ accused of heresye. How say
you master doctor quod the lordys was ye true or else why said ye so? Surely
my lordys quod he I said not all thing so / but ma^y this I said in deed / that
if Hu^ne had not be^ accused of heresye / he would never have sued the
premunyre. Lo my lordys q the the other I am glad ye find me a true man. Will
ye command me any more service? Nay by my troth q one of ye lords not in
this matter / by my will ye may go when ye will. For I have espied good man so
yt words be ^l one yt makes no matter to you which way they stand / but all
is one to you a horse myl and a myll horse / di^ke ere ye go and go e^e ye
drink. Nay my lordys quod h^ I will not drink dod yield you. And therwyth he
made curteyse and went his way / leuynge some of the lordys lawghynge to se
the good plain old honest man / how that as contrary as their two talys were
/ yet wha^ he herd the^ both again / he marked no dyfference between them /
but took them both for one / because ye wordys were one. By my truth q your
friend these three thyngys came meryly to pass / and I would not for a good
thing but I had herd them. For here may a man se that mysse understanding
makes mysse reportyng. And a tale that ^^eeth through many mouths / catches
many new feathers / which when they be pulled away again / leave him as pylled
as a coote and sometime as bare as a byrdys ars. But I thyn^e verily for all
this there was great euydence given against the chau^celer / for he was at
length endyghted of Hunnys death / and was a great while in prison / and in
co^clusyo^ never durst abide the trial of twelve men for his acquytayle / but
was fayn by frendshyp to get a perdo^. But I beseech you for my myndys sake /
show me what thought your self therein. Of troth quod I there were diverse
suspycyouse thyngys laid against him / and al those well and substa^cyally
answered again for him. How be yt upon the telling of a tale often time
happeth / that wh^^ all (...) that can be said therein / yet shall the (...)
some think one way and some a another. And therefore though I can not think but
that the Jury which were right honest men / found the verd^cte as them self
thought in their own conscience to be truth / yet in mine own mind for
ought that eue^ I herd thereof in my life as help god I could never think yt.
If he had not ben gyltye quod your friend / he would never have sued his
perdon. Yes quod I right wise men have I herd say ere this / that they will
never refuse neither goddys pardon nor the kyngys. It were no wysdom in a matter
of many suspycyouse talys be they never so false / to stand on twelve mennys
mouths where one may find a surer way. But I think verily that if he had be^
gyltye / he should never have gotten his pardon. For all be yt that th^re was
never I trow brought in this world a prince of more benygne nature / nor of
more merciful mind / than is our sovereign lord that now reygneth and long
mo^e reygne upon us / whereby never king could find in his hart^ more freely
to forgive and forgete offe^cys done and committed unto him self / yet has his
highness such a fervent affe^cio^ to right and justice in other me^nes causys
/ and such a tender zele to the conseruacio^ of his subgectes / of whose lyuys
his high wysedom consydereth many to stand in parell by the geuyng of perdon to
a few wylfull murderers / that never was there king / I believe yt ever ware the
crown in this realm which has in so many yerys given unto such fol^e so few.
And therefore I make my self sure that in such a wylfull purpe^sed (...) cruel
deed as this had been if hit had been true / all the frendys that could have
been founden for the chancellor in this world / could never have gotten his
pardon to pass in such wise / had yt not be that upon the report of all the
cyrcumstancys / the kyng^ high prudence which with out flatery perceth as deep
in to the bo^ome of a dowtefull matter as ever I saw man in my life / had well
perceived his innoce^cye And sithe I ^e^yly believe that if he had been gyltye
he never coud have gotten in such an he^^hnous murder any pardon of the hy^^ys
hyghnes / I dare make my self much more bold of his innocence now. For ye
shall v^dersta^d that he never sued pardon therefore. B^t after long
examynacyon of the matter / as well the chancellor as other/being endyghted
of the deed and arrayned v^pon the entyghtement in the hy^gis bench / pled^d
that they were not ^yltie. And thervppon the kyn^ys grace being well and
suffycyently enformyd of the truth / and of his blyssed dysposycyon not
wylli^g that there should in his name any false matter be maynt^ynyd / g^ue in
commandment to his a^^^^n^y to confess their plees to be true without any
farther troble. which thing in so faithful a prince i^ a clear declaracyon
that the meter laid to the chancellor was ^urte^.
And as for my self in good faith as I told you before. I never hard in my
life (and yet have I herd all I wen^ yt well could be said) therein any thing
y^ moved me after both the parties herd / to think that he should be gyltye.
And bysydys al this consyde^ing that Hunne was (as they that well know him
say he was in deed) though he were a fair dealer among his neygbours^ yet a
man high minded and set on the glory of a vyctory / which he hoped to have in
the premunyre / whereof he much hosted as they said among his famylyare frendys
/ that he trusted to be spoken of long after his days / and have his matter in
the y^rys and termys called Hunnys case. which when he perceived would go
against his purpose / and that in the temporal law he should not win his
spurrys / and over that in y^ spyrytuall law perceived so myche of his secret
sorys vnwrapped and dyscouered that he began to fall in fere of worldly shame /
yt is to me much more lykely that for werynes of his life he rydde him self
out thereof (which manner of affectyon we se not seldom happen / specially sith
the devil might peradventure join therwt a malycyouse hope of yt which after
happed that the suspycyon of his death myth be laid to the charge and parell of
the chancellor) this is I say myche more lykely to me / than the thing
whereof I never herd the like before / that the bysshoppys chaunceler should kill
in the lollardys tower a man so sore suspect and co^vycte of heresye / whereby
he might bring him self in besynes / where as if he hated the man (For kill
him he would not ye wot well if he loved him) he might easily bring him to
shame and peradventure to shameful death also.

In good faith q your friend wyste I that yt were true that he was an heretyque
in deed / and in parell to be so proved / I would well think that in malice and
dyspayre he hanged him self. God quod I knows of all thing the troth. But
what I have herd therein that shall I show you.

My self was present in poulys wha^ the bysshype in ye presence of ye Mayre
and the aldremen of the city condemned him for an heretyque after his death.
And then were there read o^e^ly ye deposyons / by which yt was well proved
that he was conuyc^e as well of diverse other heresies as of mysbyleue toward
the holy sacrement of the ^wter. And thervppon was the judgment given / that
his body should be burned / and so was yt. Now this is quod I to me a full
proof. For I assure you the bishop was a very wise man a virtuous and a
cu^nyng. By saint mary quod he the proof is the better by so much. I shall tell
you quod I a another thyng^/wh^che when ye here ye shall peradventure believe yt
yet the better. That would I gladly know quod he. For as farer as I can here
never man had him sus^ec^e of any such th^^^e before. Forsooth quod I that can
I not tell. But so yt happ^d that as I remember syx or seven year after that
Hu^ne was thus hanged and his body burned for an heretyke / there was one in
Essex a carpenter that used to make pumpes / which had intended with other
such as he was him self to do great robbery / and thervppon was he brought
unto the court. Where by the commandment of the kyngys grace / a great
honorable estate of this realm and my self had him in examynacyon. Wherein
among other thyngys he confessed that he had long holden diverse heresies /
which he said that his brother being ^ clerk of a church had taught both his
father and him. And I promise you those heresies were of an heygth. Than he
showed us what other conning masters of that scole he had herd read / and
specially in a place which he named us in London / where he said yt such
heretyques were wont ^o resort to their redyngys in a chamber at mydnyght. And
when we asked him ye namys of them that were wont to haunte those mydnyghte
lecturis / he rehearsed us diverse / and among other he named Rychard hunne.
Whereof we somewhat meruayled in our myndys / but nothing said we thereto / but
let him rehearse on all such as he could call to mind. And when he stopped and
could remember no^^/than asked we of the^ that he had named / what they were
and where they dwelled. And he told us of some of them that were co^uycted /
and some yt were ^^edde / and some that were yet at that time dwelling ^^yll
in the town. And in the way wha^ we asked him what man was yt Hu^ne that he
spoke of / he told us his person and his house. And where is he now said we?
Mary q he I went to Tourney / and when I came thense again / than herd I say
that he was hanged in the lollardys tower and his body burned for an heretyque.
And thus there learned we long after / that Hu^ne had haunted heretyques
lectures by night long before / which we declared unto the kyngys highness as
he had confessed. And his highness though he was sorry yt any man should be so
lewd / yet hyghly did rejoice that ye goodness of god brought such hyd
myschyefe more and more to light. So after had we by the kyngys commandment
that ma^nys brother in examynacyo^ / which did in deed confess nothing /
neither of ye felonyes nor of the heresies. But yet his brother did abide by
them and anowed them in his face / with such markys and tokens as yt might
well appear that he said treuth. And surely marvel were it if he would fasly
have feigned such heyghnouse things against his own brother / his own father
and him self / being thereto nothing compelled / nor put either in pain or
fere. Now was the father deed / and other could we not come by / who^ we might
ferther examyne of that night scole / saving that he which as I told you
confessed this matter / showed us also at ye first time of one man in London
taken for good and honest / which was as he said a scoler also of his brother
in those heresies / which man for his honesty we forbear to meddle with / till
we should have the the other brother. who^ as sone we had in handys / and that he
was committed to the marshalsye / this other man which was as I told you
de^^cted unto us for an heretyque and a scoler of his / came to me to labor
and sue for him / pretendynge that he did yt for cheryte. And for as much as we
thought we could not fail of him wha^ we would have him / we forbear therefore
to examyne him / till we should have examyned the the other whom he labored for
But than were we not ware in what wise we should be dysapoynted of him. For so
myshapped yt in deed / yt after his being at me to labor for him whose scoler
i^ heresy he was detecte to be / he was in his own house suddenly stryken and
slain. And that wreched end had he. What consyence he dyed with god knows /
for I can tell you no ferther. By saint John^ quod your friend but upon ye hole
tale / yt seems to me very clear that Hunne was him self not clear of the
matter. Surely quod I so seemed yt as far as I cowlde wit / unto as many as
ever herd yt / and would yet I wene have seemed so more clearly / if they had
be^ present at thexamynacyo^s / and seen under what manner the man came forth
therewith. But yet quod your friend as for his englysh bible / though Hunne
were him self an heretyque / yet might the book be good enough. And no good
reason is there why a good book should be burned with an evil man. Ye call me
well home quod I / and put me well in mind. For yt was the thing whereby ye took
occasyon to talk of Hunne / of whom we talked so long / that at last I had
forgoten wherefore and whervppo^ we entered in to that communycacyon. And yet
make those bokys not a little to the matter that we had in hand / I mean
toward the perceiving what opinion that Hunne was of. For surely at such time
as he was denounced for an heretyque / there lay his englysh bible open / and
some other english bokys of his / that every man might sethe placys noted with
his own hand / such wordys / and in such wise / that there would no wise man
yt good were / have any great dowte after the syghte thereof / what naughty
myndys the me^ had / both he that so noted them / and he that so made them. I
remember not now the specyaltees of the matter / nor the formal wordys as they
were written. But this I remember well that besydys other thyngys framed for the
favor of diverse other heresies / there were in the prologe of that bible such^
wordys touching ye blyssed sacrament / as good christian me^ did myche abhor
to here / and which gave the reders undoubted occasyo^ to think that the book
was written after ^yclyffs copy / and by him translated in to our tongue. And yet
whyther the book be burned or secretly kept I can not surely say. But truly
were the clergy of my mind / yt should be some where reserved / for the
perpetual proof of the matter / there has gone so much suspycyous rumor therof^
Which as I believe were all well answered and the mind fully satysfyed o^ any
man that wise were and good therwt / that onys had ouerloked / red / and
aduysedly considered that book.

The.xvi. chapyter.
The messenger reherseth some causys which he has herd laid by some of the
clergy / wherefore ye scryptur^ should not be suffered in englysh. And the author
shows his mind that yt were conuenye^t to have the bible in english. And
therwyth ends the third book.

Sir quod your friend yet for all this can I se no cawse why the clergy should
keep the bible out of lay mennys handys / that can no more but their mother
tongue. I had went q I that I had proved you plainly / that they keep yt not
from the^. For I have showed you that they keep none from them / but such
translacyon as be either not yet approved for good / or such as be all ready
reproved for naught / as Wyclyffys was and Tyndals. For as for other old onys
/ that were before Wyclyffys days / remayn lawful / and be in some folkys
handys had and red. Ye say well quod he. But yet as women say / somewhat yt was
always that ye cat wynked when her eye was out. Surely so is yt not for naught
that ye englysh bible is in so few mennys handys / when so many would so fayn
have yt. That is very troth q I. For I think that though the favorers of a
sect of heretyques be so fervent in the setting for the of their sect / that
they let not to lay their money together and make a purse among the^ for the
pryntyng of an evil made or evil translated book / which though yt hap to
be forboden and burned yet some be sold ere they be spyed / and each of them
lose but their part / yet I thynk there will no prynter lyghtely be so hot to
put any bible in prent at his own charge / whereof the loss should lie hole in
his own neck / and than hang upon a doutfull trial whyther the first copy
of his translacyon was made before Wyclyffys days or synnys. For if yt were
made synnys / yt must be approved before the pryntynge. And surely how yt
has happed that in all this while god has either not suffered or not
provided that any good virtuous man has had the mind in faithful wise to
translate yt / and thervppo^ either the clergy or at the lest wise somone
bishop to approve yt / this can no thing tell. But how so ever yt be / I
have herd and here so myche spoken in the matter / and so much dout made there in
/ that peradventure yt would let and wythdrawe any one bishop from the
admyttyng thereof / without the assent of the remanaunt. And where as many
thyngys be laid against yt / yet is there in my mind not one thing that more
puts good men of the clergy in dout to suffer yt / than this yt they se
sometime myche of the worse sort more fervent in the calling for yt / than the^
whom we find far better. Which makes them to fere lest such men desire yt
for no good / and lest if yt were had in every ma^nys hand / there would great
parell arise / and that sedycyouse people should do more harm therwyth / tha^
god and honest folk should take fruit thereby. Which fere I promise you no
thing fereth me / but that who so ever would of their malice or folly take
harm of that thing that is of yt self ordained to do all men good / I would
never for thauoydyng of their harm / take from other the profit which they
might take / and no thing deserve to lose. For else if thabuse of a good thing
should cause the taking away thereof from other that would use yt well / Christ
should him self never have been borne / nor brought his faith in to the world /
nor god should never have made yt neither / if he should for ye loss of those
that would be dampened wreches / have kept away thoccasyon of reward from them
that would with help of his grace endeavor them to deserve yt. I am sure q
your friend ye dowt not but that I am full and hole of your mind in this matter
that ye bible should be in our englysh tongue. But yet that ye clergy is of the
contrary and would not have yt so / that appears well in that they suffer it
not to be so. And over that I here in every place almoost where I find any
learned man of them / their minds all set thereon to keep ye scryptur from us.
And they seek out for ye part every roten reason that they can find / and set
them forth solemply to ye show / though five of those reasons be not worth a
fygge. For they begin as far as our first father Adam / and show us that his
wife and he fell out of paradyse with desire of knowledge and cunning. Now if
this would serve / it must from ye knowledge and study of scripture drive every
man priest and other / lest yt drive all cut of paradyse. Than say they that
god taught his dyscyples many thyngys aparte / bycawse the people should not
here yt. And therefore they would the people should not now be suffered to read
all. Yet they say ferther y^ yt is hard to translate the scripture out of one
tongue in to a another / and specially they say in to ours. which they call a
tongue vulgar and barbarous. But of all thing specially they say that scripture
is the fode of the soul. And that the comen people be as infantys that must be
fed but with milk and pappe. And if we have any stronger mete yt must be
chammed before by the nurse and so put in to ye babys mouth. But me thynk though
the make us all infantys / they shall find many a shrewd brayn among us / y^ can
perceive chalk fro chese well enough and if they would onys take us our mete in
our own hand. We be not so evil tothed but y^ within a while they shall se
us chamme yt our self as well as they. For let them call us young babys and they
wul / yet by god they shall for all that well find in some of us y^ an old
knave is no child. Surely quod I such thyngys as ye speak / is the thing that
as I somewhat said before puts good folk in fere to suffer the scripture in
our englysh tongue. Not for the redynge and receyuyng / but for y^ bysy chammyng
thereof / and for myche medlyng with such partys thereof as lest will agree with
their capacytees. For undoubtedly as ye spoke of our mother Eve / i^ordynate
appetyte of knowledge in a mean to drive any man out of a paradyse. And
inordynate is the apperyte when men unlearned though they read yt in their
langage / will be bysye to enserche and dyspute the great secret mysteryes of
scripture / which though they here they be not able to perceive. This thing
is plainly forboden us that be not appointed nor instructed thereto. And
therefore holy saint Gregory naziazenus that great solemn doctor sore
touches and reproves all such bold besy medlers in the scripture / and
shows that yt is in Exody by Moses a scendynge up upon the hill where he
spoke with god and ye people taryeng benethe / ye ye people be forbode^ to
presume to meddle with the high mysteryes of holy scripture / but owe to be
content to tarry bynethe and meddle none higher than is mete for them / but
receyuynge fro the heyght of the hill by Moses that y^ is delivered them / yt
is to wit the lawys and preceptys yt they must keep / and the poyntys they
must believe / look well theruppon / and often / and meddle well therwyth. Not to
dyspute yt but to fulfill yt. And as for the high secret mysteryes of god /
and hard textys of his holy scripture / let us know that we be so unable to
asc^ed up so high on that hill / that yt shall bycu^ us to say to the preche
ours appointed thereto as the people said unto Moses / her^ you god and let us
here you. And surely y^ bles^^d holy doctor saint Hierome gretely complayneth
and rebukes that lewd homely manner / that the comen lay people men and w^^^n
were in his days so bold in the medlynge / dysputyng / and expownyng of holy
scripture. And shows plainly that they shall have evil prefe therein / that
will reke^ the^self to understand yt by the^ self without a reder. For yt is a
thing y^ requires good help / and long time / and an hole mind given gretely
thereto. And surely sith as the holy appostles saint Powle in diverse of his
epistle says / god has by his holy spyryte so instytute and ordained his
church / that he will have some reders and some herers / some techers and some
lerners / we do plainly peruerte and turn up so down the right order of
Crystys church / when the tone part medleth with the tothers office. Plato
the great philosopher specially for bedeth such as be not admytted thereunto
nor men mete therefore / to meddle myche and embesy^ them self in reasonyng and
dysputyng upon the temporal lawys of the city / which would not be reasoned
upon but by folk mete therefore and in place conuenyent. For else they that
can not very well attain to perceive them / begin to mysse like / dysprayse
/ and contempne them. Whereof follows the breche of the lawys and dysordre of
the people. For till a law^ be changed by authoryte / yt rather ought to be
observed than contempned. Or else the example of (...) law boldly broken and
set at naught / waxes a precedent for the remanaunt t^ be used like. And
comenly the best laws shall worst lyk^ myche of the comen people / which
most long (if they might be herd and followed) to live all at lyberty^ under
none at all. Now if Plato so wise a man so thought good in temporal lawys
thyngys of mennys making / how myche is yt less mete for every man boldly
to meddle with the exposycyon of holy scripture / so devised and endyted by y^
high wisdom of god / y^ yt far excedeth in many places the capacyte and
perceyuyng of man. It was also provided by the emperor in the law cyuyle /
that the comen people should never be so bold to ^epe dispycio^s upon the faith
or holy scripture / nor that any such thing should be used among the^ or before
them. And therefore as I said before / y^ special fere in this matter is /
lest we would be to besye in chammynge of the ^crypture our self / which ye
say we were able enough to do. which vndowtely the wyseste and the best
learned / and he that th^rin has by many yerys bestowed his hole mind / is yet
unable to do. And than far more unable must ^e needs be / y^ boldly will
upon the fyr^^ redynge bycawse he knows the wordys / take upon him therefore
to teache other me^ the sentence with parell of his own soul and other mennys
to / by the bringing men in to mad ways / sectys / and heresies / such as
heretyques have of old brought up and the church has condemned. And
thus in these matters if y^ comen people might be bold cha^me yt as ye say and to
dyspute yt / tha^ should ye have y^ more blind the more bold / the more
ignorant the more bysy / the less wit the more inquysytyfe / the more fool
the more talkatyf of great doutys and high questyons of holy scripture and of
gods great and secret mysteryes / and this not sobrely of any good affection
/ but presumptuousely and irreverently at mete and at mele. And there wha^ y^
wine were in and the wit out / would they take upon the^ with folysh words and
bl^sphemie ^o handle holy scripture in more homely manner tha^ a song of Robyn
hode. And some would as I said solemply take upon the^ like as they were ordynary
reders to interpret y^ text at their pleasure / and therwt fall the^ self and
draw down other with the^ in to sedycyouse sects and heresies / whereby the
scripture of god should lose his honor and reverence / and be by such
vnreuerent and vnsytting demeanure among much people quyte and clean abused /
unto ye contrary of that holy purpose yt god ordained yt for. Where as if we
would no ferther meddle therwyth but well and devoutly read yt / and in that
that is plain and euydent as goddys co^maundementys and his holy counsayls
ende^our our self to follow with help of his grace asked thereunto / and in his
great and meruelouse miracles consider his god head / and in his lowly birth /
his godly life / and his bitter passion / exercise our self in such
medytacyons / prayour / and virtues / as the matter shall mynyster us occasyo^ /
knowledgynge our own ignorance where we find a dowte / and therein lenynge to
the faith of the church / wrestle with no such text as might bring us in a
d^^^ and werestye of any of those artycles wherein every good christian man is
clear / by this manner of redyng can no man nor woman take hurt in holy
scripture. Now than the thyngys on the t^ther side y^ unlearned people can never
by them self attain / as in the psalmys and the prophetys and diverse partys
of the gospel / where the wordys be sometime sp^ken as in the person of the
prophet him self / sometime as in the person of god / sometime of some other as
angels deuyls or men / and sometime of our savior Christ / not always of one
fassyon / but sometime as god / sometime as man / sometime as head of this
mystycall body his church mylytant here in earth / sometime as head of his
church tryumphaunt in heaven / sometime as in the person of his sensual parties
of his own body / ^therwhyle in the person of some partycular^ part of his
body mystycal / and these thyngys with many other oftentimes interchaunged /
and suddenly sundry thyngys of diverse matters dyuersly me^gled together / all
these thyngys which is not possible for unlearned men to attain vnt^/yt were
more than madness for them to meddle with all / but leave all these thyngys to
them whose hole study is byset thervppon / and to the precheours appointed
thereunto / which may show them such things in time and place conuenyent
with reverence and authorite / the sermon so tempered / as may be mete and
conuenye^t always for y^ psent audience. Whereunto it appears y^ our savior him
self and his apostles after him / had ever a specyal respect. And therefore as I
say forsooth I ca^ i^ no wise agree with you y^ it were mete for me^ unlearned to be
besy with ye cha^mi^g of holy scryptur / but to have yt cha^med unto them. For
that is y^ precheours part and theyrs / that after long study are admytted
to read and expowne it. And to this intent way all the wordys as far as I
perceive of all holy doctors y^ any thing have written in this matter. But
never me^t they as I suppose the forbedynge of y^ bible to be red in any
vulgar tongue. Nor I never yet herdeny reason laid / why yt were not co^uenye^t
to have y^ bible translated in to thenglysh to^g / but all those reasons seemed
they never so gay and gloryouse at y^ first syghte / yet when they were well
examyned they might in effect for aught that I can se / as well be laid against
y^ holy writers y^ wrote y^ scripture in the ebrue tongue / and against ye
blyssed eua^gelystes yt wrote the scripture in greek / and against al those in
like wise that translated yt out of every of those tougysin to laten / as to
their charge that would well and faithfully translate yt out of laten in to our
englysh tongue. For as for that our tongue is called barbarouse / is but a
fantesye. For so is as every learned man knows / every strange langage to
other. And if they would call yt barayn of words / there is no doubt but yt is
plentuouse enough to express our myndys in any thing whereof one man has used
to sp^ke with a another. Now as touching y^ dysty^^ltie which a tra^slatour
fyndeth in expressyng well and lively ye sentence of his author / which is hard
always to do so surely but yt he shall su^tyme mynysh ^yther of ye se^te^ce or
of ye grace yt yt bears in the formare to^g / y^ point has lye^ in their
light yt have translated ye scripture all ready either out of greek into late^
or out of ebrew in to any of them both / as by many translacyo^s which we read
all ready to the^ y^ be learned appears. Now as touching the harm y^ may^ grow
by such blind bayardys as will wha^ they read the bible in englysh be more
bysy than will bycu^ the^. They yt touch y^ poi^t harp upon ye right string
/ and touch truly ye great harm yt were lykely to grow to some folk / how be
yt not by thoccasyon yet of thenglyshe tra^slacyon / but by thoccasyon of their
own lewdenes and folly / which yet were not in my mi^de a sufficyent cause to
exclude y^ tra^slacyon and to put other folk from y^ benefyte thereof / but
rather to make puysyon against such abuse / and let a good thing go forth. No
wise man were there y^ would put all wepe^s away because manquellers myste use
them. Nor this let not as I said y^ scripture to be first wryte^ in a
vulgar to^g: For ye scripture as I said before was not wryte^ but in a vulgar
tongue / such^ as y^ hole people understood / nor i^ no secret ciphers but such
come^ letters as almost every man coud read. For neither was ye ebrew nor ye
greek to^g nor ye late^ neither / any other spech tha^ such as al y^ people
spoke. And therefore if we should lay yt yt were evil done to translate y^
scripture in to our tongue / because yt is vulgar and come^ to every englysh man
/ tha^ had yt be^ as evil done to translate it in to greek or in to laten / or
to write (...) new testament first i^ greek or ye old tes^^me^t in ebrew /
because both those to^ges were as very vulgar as ours. And yet should there by
this reason also not only y^ scripture be kept out of our to^g / But over y^
should y^ redi^g thereof be forboden both all such lay people and all such
prestys to / as can no more than their grammar and very scantly that. All which
company though they can understand the wordys / be yet as far from ye
perceyuyng of the sentence in hard and doutfull tertys / as were our women if
the scripture were translated to our own la^gage. How be it of troth seldom
has yt ben seen yt any sect of heretyques has bygonne of such unlearned folk
as nothing could else but ye langage wherein they red ye scripture / but there
has always come^ly these sects spro^ge^ of ye pride of such folk / as had with
ye knowledge of ye tongue su^ high persu^syo^ in the^ self of their own lerning
bysyde. To whose authoryte su^ other folk have sone after part of malice /
part of symplenes / and much part of pleasure and delight in newfa^glenes /
fallen in and encreaced ye faccio^. But yt head has ever comenly ben either
some proud learned man / or at the le^te bysyde the langage some proud smaterer
in lernyng. So yt if we should for fere of heretyques that might hap to grow
thereby keep the sc^ypture out of any tongue / or out of unlearned mennys hand is /
we should for like fere be feign to keep yt out of all tongys / and out of
learned me^nys handys to / and wot not whom we might trust therwyth. Wherefore
there is as me thi^keth no remedy but if any good thing shall go forward /
somewhat must nedys be adue^tured. And some folk will not fail to be naught.
Against which thyngys prouy^y on must be made / yt as much good may grow / and
as little harm ^u^ as can be devised / and not to keep the hole co^modyte from
any hole people / bycawse of harm yt by their own folly and faw^e may cu^ to
some part. As though a lewd surgeon would cut of the leg by the kne to keep
yt to fro ye gout / or cut of a mannys head by ye sholders to keep him from
tothe ache. There is no tretyce of scripture so hard but yt a good virtuous
man or woman either / shall su^what find therein yt shall delight and encreace
their deuocyo^ bysydes this / yt every prechynge shall be ye more pleasant and
fru^eful unto the^ wha^ they have in their mi^d yt place of scripture yt they
shall there here expowned. For though yt be as yt is in deed / great wisdom
for a pre^hour to use dyscrecio^ in his pchyng and to have a respect unto ye
qualytees and capacytees of his audyence / yet lets yt no thing / but yt ye
hole audye^ce may without harm have red and have ready ye scripture in mind / yt
he shall in his prechi^g declare and expowne. For no dout is there / but ye god
and his holy spyryte has so prudently te^pered their speech through ye hole
corpse of scripture / yt every man may take good thereby and no man harm / but
he yt will in the study thereof / lene prowdly to ye folly of his own^ wit. For all be yt y^ Christ did speak to the people in parables and expowned them
secretly to his especyall dyscyples / and sometime forbear to tell su^ thyngys
to the^ also bycawse they were not as yet able to here them / and thappostles
in like wise did sometime spare to speak to su^ people ye thyngys that they did
not let plainly to speak to su^ other / yet lets all this nothing the
translacyon of the scripture in to our own tongue / no more than in the laten.
Nor yt is no cause to keep the corpse of the scryptur^ owte of the handys of any
christian people so many yerys fastely confermed in faith / bycawse Christ and
his appostles used such prouysyon in their vtteraunce of so strange and
vnherde mysteryes / either unto Jews Paynyms or newly crystened folk /
except we would say that all thexposycyons which Christ made him self upon
his own parables unto his secret seruau^tys and disciples wtdrawe^ from the
people / should now at this day be kept in like wise from ye co^mens / and no
man suffered to read or here them but those that in his church represent ye
state and office of his appostles. which there will I wot well no wise man say
/ considering that those thyngys which were than comenly most kept from ye
people / be now most necessary for ye people to know. As yt well appears by all
such things i^ effect as our savior at ye time taught his apostles a part.
Whereof I would not for my mind wthold the profyt yt one good devout vnlernedley
man might take by ye redyng / not for ye harm that an hundred heretyques would
fall in by their own wylfull abusyon / no more tha^ our sa^you^ let for the
weal of such as would be with his grace of his little chosen ^^okke / to come in
to this world and he l^^is offensionis / et petra scandali / the stone of
stu^blyng / and the stone of falling / and ruin to all the wylfull wreches in
ye world beside. Finally me thinks that the constytucyon prouyncyall of
which we spoke right now has determined this questyon all ready. For when ye
clergy therein agreed that the englysh bybles should remain whych^ ware
translated before Wyclyffes days / they consequentely did agree yt to have the
bible in englysh was none hurt. And in yt they forbade any new tra^slacyon to
be read till yt were approved ^y ye bishops yt appears well thereby that
their intent was yt the bishop should approve yt if he found yt fawtelesse /
and also of reason amend yt where yt were fawtye / but if the man we^^ an
heretyque that made yt / or the fawtis such and so many / as yt were more ethe
to make yt all new than mend yt. As yt happed for both poyntys in the
translacyon of Tyndall.

Now if yt so be yt yt would happily be thought not a thing me^ely to be
adventured / to set all on a flushe at onys / and dash rashly out holy
scripture in every lewd felowys tethe / yet thinks me there might such a
moderacion b^ taken therein / as neither good virtuous lay folk should lack yt /
nor rude and rash brains abuse yt. For it might be with dylyge^ce well and
truly translated by some good catholyke and well learned man / or by diverse
dyuydynge the labor among them / and after conferryng their several partys
together each with other. And after that might the wor^ be allowed and approved
by the ordynaryes / and by their authorytees so put unto prent / as all the
^opyes should come hole unto the bysshoppys hand. Which he may after his
dyscrecyon and wisdom deliver to such as h^ perceyueth honest sad and
virtuous / with a good monicyo^ and fatherly counsayl to use yt reverently with
humble h^rt and lowly mind / rather sekyng therein occasyon of devotion than of
dyspycyon. And prouydyng as much as may be / y^ the (...) be after the deceace
of the party brought again and reuere^tly restored unto the ordynary. So that
as nere as may be devised / no man have yt bu^ of the ordynaryes hand / and
by him thought^ and reputed for such / as shall belykely to use yt to goddys
honor and meryt^ of his own soul. Among whom if any be proved after to have
abused yt / than the use thereof to be forb^den him / either for ever / or till
he be waxe^ wyser. By our lady quod your friend this way myslyketh not me. But
who should set the price of the book? For sothe quod I that reken I a thing of
little force. For neither were yt a great matter for any man in manner to give a
grote or twain above the mean price for a book of so great profit / nor for
y^ bishop to give them all fre / wherein he might serve his dyo^yse with the
cost of.x. li. I think or xx. markys. Which some I dare say ^here is no
bishop but he would be glad to bestow about a thing that might do his hole
dyocyse so special a pleasure with such a spyrytuall profit. By my ^routh
quod he yet wene I yt the people would grudge to have yt on this wise delivered
them at the bishops hand / and had lever pay for yt to the pr^nter tha^ have
yt of y^ bishop fre. It might so happen with some q I. But ye^ in mine opinion
there were in that manner more wylfulnesse / than wysedom or any good mind in
such as would not be content so to receive them. And therefore I would think in
good faith yt yt would so fortune i^ few. But for god the more dowte would be /
lest the^ would grudge and hold them self sore grieved / that would require yt
and were happily denied yt. Which I suppose would not often happen unto e^y
honest howseholder to be by his dys^^^^^yo^ reverently red in his house. But
though yt were not taken to ^^ery lewd ladde in his own hands to ^ede a little
^^d^ly when he ly^^/and th^^ (...) the book at his helys / or among other such
as him self to keep ^ quo^libet and a pot parliament upon / I tr^we there will
no wise man find a fawte therein. ^e ^^ake right now^ of the Jews / among
whom the hole people have ye say the scripture in their handys. And ye thought
yt no reason that we should reken christian men les^e worthy thereto than them.
Wherein I am as ye se of your own opynyo^. But yet would god we had the like
reverence to ye scripture of god that they have. For I assure you I have herd
very worsshypful folk say which have be^ in their houses / yt a man coud not
hyre a Jew to sit down upon his bible of the old testament / but he takes yt
with great reverence in hand when he will read / and reuere^tly lays yt up
again when he has done. where as we god forgive us take little regard to sit
down on our bible with the old testament and the new to. Which homely handlyng
as yt proceeds of little reverence / so does yt more and more engender in the
mind a neclygence and contempt of goddys holy wordys. We find also yt among
the jews though all their hole bible was written in their vulgar tongue / and
those bokys thereof wherein their laws were written were usual in every ma^nys
hands / as things that god would hau^ comenly known / repeted / and kept in
remembrance / yet were there again certain partys thereof which the comen
people of the Jews of old time / both of ^^uerenc^ and for the dyffycultye
did forbere to meddle with. But now sy^h^ the ^^yle of the temple is broken
asunder that dyuyded among the jews / ye people from the sight of the secretys
/ and that god had sent his holy spyryte to be a^^ystent with his hole church to
terhe all necessary tro^the / though yt may therefore be the b^tter suffered
that no p^rte of holy scripture were kept owte of honest lay me^nys hands / yet
would I y^ no perte thereof should come in their / which to their own harm and
happily their neighbors to / would handle yt over homely / and be to bold and
besy therwyth. And also though holy scripture be as ye said while ere / a
medicine for him yt is syk / and fode for him yt is hole / yet sith there is
many a body sore soul sykke that takes him self for hole / and in holy
scripture is an hole feste of so myche diverse vyaunde / that after the
affection and state of sundry stomakys / one may take harm by the self same yt
shall do a another good / and syk folk often have such a corrupt tallage in
their taste that they most like yt mete that is most unwholesome for them / yt
were not therefore as me thinks unreasonable that the ordynary whom godhath
in the dyocyse appointed for ye chyef physycyo^ / to dyscerne between the hole
and the syk / and between disease and disease / should after his wysdom and
dyscrecyon appoynte every body their part / as he should perceive to be good
and holsom for them. And therefore as he should not fail to find many a man /
to whom he might commit all the hole / so to say the truth I can se none
harm therein / though he should commit unto some man ye gospel of Matthew / Mark
or Luke / whom he should yet forbede the gospel of saint John^ / and suffer
some to read the actys of the apostles / whom he would not suffer to meddle with
the Apocalypse. Many were there I think yt should take much profit by saint
Powlys epistle ad Ephesios / wherein he gives good counsel to every kind of
people / and yet should find little fruit for their understanding in his epistle
ad Rom^nos / conteynyng such high dyffycultyes as very few learned men can very
well attain. And in like wise would yt be in diverse other partys of the bible
as well in the old testament as the new / so that as I say though the
bishop might unto some lay man by take and conmytte with good advise and
instruccio^ ye hole bible to read / yet might he to some man well and with
reason restrayn the redyng of some part / and from some bysye body the m^dlynge
with any part at all / more th^n he shall here in sermons set out and declared
unto him / and in like wise to take the bible away from such fo^^^ again /
as be proved by their blind presumpcyon to abuse the occasyon of their profete
unto their own hurt and harm. And thus may the bishop order the scripture
in our handys / with as good reason as the father does by his dyscrecyon
appoyne which of his chyldern may for his sad keep a knyfe to cut his mete /
and which for his wantonness have his knyfe taken from him for cuttynge of his
fyngers. And thus am I bold without preiudyce of other mennys judgment / to
show you my mind in this matter / how the scripture might without great parell
and not without great profit / be brought in to our tongue and taken to lay
men and women both / not yet menyng thereby but yt ye hole bible might for my
mind be suffered to be spread abroad in e^glysh. But if yt were so much dowted
that parcase all might thereby be let the^ / would I rather have used such
moderacyon as I speak of or some such other as wyser men can better deuyse. How
be yt upon that I red late in the pystle that the kings hyghnes translated in
to english / of his own which his grace made in laten answeryng to the letter
of Luther / my mind gives me yt his maiesteis of his blyssed zele so minded to
move this matter unto the prela^es of the clergy / among whom I have petreyued
/ some of ye gretest and of the best of their own myndys well inclynable thereto
all ready / that we lay people shall in this matter ere long time pass except
the fawte be founden in our self / be well and fully satysfyed and content. In
good faith quod he that will in my mind be very well done. And now am I for my
mind in all this matter fully content and satysfyed. Well quod I than will we to
dinner / and the remanaunt will we fynyshe after. And therwyth went we to mete.

The end of the third book.
The fourth book.
The first chapyter.
The author shows wherefore yt were not well done / to suffer Luthers bokis or
any other heretykes / to go abroad and be red among the people / though there
were some good thyngys in them among yt bad.

WHen we had after dinner a little paused / your friend and I drew our self aside
i^ to ye gardyn. And there syttyng down in an herber / he bygan to enter forth
in to ye matter / sayng that he had well perceived that not in his cuntre only
but also in the vnyuer syte where he had been / there were that had none evil
opynyo^ of Luther / but thought that his bokys were by the clergy forb^den of
malice and evil will / to the end that folk should not surely se and perfaytely
percyue what he says / or at the least what thing he means by his wordys.
which will not appear they thynk by a line taken out in the myddys of a lefe /
but by the dylygent consyderacyo^ of the hole matter. Without which me^ might
impute a wrong blame they sayt / to the best writers that ever wrote i^ this
world. But they think that the clergy will not have his bokys red / bycawse
that in them lay men may read the prestys fawtys / which was they say the very
cause of the condempnacyon. For else whyther he had written well or ^uyl / yet
they say his bokys had been kept in mennys handys and red. For there is they
think therein though some part were naught / meny thyngys yet well said /
whereof there was no reason that men should lose the profit for the bad. And
also reason men think yt were / that all were herd that ca^ be said touching
the treuth to be known / concerning the matters of our salvation / to thentent
that all herd and perceived / men may for their own surety yt better these and
hold the right way.

Forsooth q I if yt were now dowtful and ambyguouse whyther y^ church of Christ
were in the right rule of doctrine or not / than were yt very necessary to give
them all good audyence yt could and would any thing dyspute on either party
for yt or against yt / to thend that if we were now in a wrong way / we might
leave yt and walk in some better. But now on yt the other side if yt so be as in
deed yt is / that Crystes church has the true doctrine all ready / and the self
same that saint Powle would not give an angel of heaven audye^ce to the
contrary / what wisdom were yt now therein to show our self so mystrustfull
and wauerynge / that for to search whyther our faith were false or true / we
should give heryng not to an angel of heaven / but to a fond friar / to an
apostate / to an open incestuouse lechour / a plain lymme of the devil / and
a manifest messenger of hell. In which wordys if ye would happily thynk that I
use my self to sore to call him by such odyouse namys / ye must consider that
he spares not both untruly and without necessyte in his raylyng bokys / to
call by as evil / them who^ his duty were hyghly to reverence / where as I do
between us twayn call him but as him self has showed him / in his writing /
in his living / and in his mad marriage. And yet I neither do yt nor would /
were yt not that ye matter self of reason does require yt. For my part is yt
of necessyte to tell how naught he is / because that ye wors the man is the
more madness were yt for wise men to give his false fables herkenyng against
goddys undoubted trewthe / by his holy spyryte taught unto his church / and by
such multitude of miracles / by so myche blood of holy martyrs / by the
virtuous living of so many blyssed confessors / by the puryte and clennesse
of so many chaste wydowes and vndefouled vyrgyns / by the holsom doctrine of so
many holy doctors / and finally by the hole consent and agreement of all
Christian people this fyften hundred year confermed. And therefore not any respect
unto his raylyng against ye clergy / is as some would have it seem the cause of
his condempnacyon and suppression of his bokys. For the good men of the clergy
be not so sore grieved with them that towche the fawtys of the bad / nor the
bad them self be not so renderered / that for ye only talkyng of their
fautes they would bannyshe the bokis yt were good in other thyngys bysyde. For
else could not the bokys of many old holy fathers have endured so long /
wherein the vycys of them that in the clergy be naught / be very vehemently
rebuked. But the very cause why his bokys be not suffered to be red / is because
his heresies be so many / and so abhomynable / and the prouys therwyth he
prete^deth to make them probable be so far from reason and troth / and so
far against the right understanding of holy scripture / whereof under color
of great zele and affection he laboreth to destroy the credence and good use /
and finally so far stretches all thing against good manner and virtue /
prouokyng the world to wrong opynions of god and boldness in sin and
wrechednes / that there can no good / but myche harm grow by the redyng. For
if there were the substance good / and of error or ouersyght some cocle among
the corn / which might be syfted ow^ and the remanau^t stand instead / men
would have be^ content therwyth as they be with such other. But now is his not
byspryent with a few spottys / but with more then half venym poisoned the hole
wine / and that right roten of yt self. And this done if purpose and malice /
not without an evil spyryte in such wise walkyng with his wordys / that the
contagyon thereof were lykely to enfecte a feeble soul / as the sauoure of a
sykenes sore enfecteth an hole body. Nor the trourth is not to be ler^ed of
every mannys mouth. For as Cry^t was content not that the devil should call hi^
goods son though it were stew so is he not content that a deuyls lymme as
Luther is or Tyndal / should ^eche his flokke the troth / for infectyng them
with their false deuylysh heresies bysydes. For like wise as the holy scripture
of god because of ye good spyryte that made yt is of his own nature apt to
purge and amend the reder / though some that read yt of their inuyncyble malice
turn yt to their harm / so do such wrytyngys as Luth^rs is / in the making
whereof the ^^uyll is of counsayll and gives therwyth a breath of his as^^stence
/ th^^gh the goodness of some men m^yster the malice thereof / walking
harmeles with goddys help / as the prophet says upon the serpent and the
cocatrye^/and tredynge upon the lion and the dragon / yet be such workys of
them self always right vnh^lsom to meddle with / mete and apt to corrupt and
infecte ye reder. For ye proof whereof we need none other example / than this
that we be in hand wythal / if we consider what good the redynge of his books
has done in Saxony. And this find we m^re tha^ to myche proved here among us
/ that of.x. that use to read his bokys / ye shall scantly find tway^/but that
they not only cast of prayer and fasting and al such godly ver^^^^ ^s holy
scryptur commends / and the church commands / and vertu^us people have ever
had in great price / but also fall in plain co^tempte and hatered thereof. So
that what fruit should gr^^^ of the redyng ye may sone guess.

The.ii. chapyter.
The author she^^th many of Luthers heresies to be so ab^minable / and some
part also so peuysh / that ye very bare rehersall i^ enough with out any
ferther dyspycion th^^^ppo^ / to cause any good man abhor^e the^ / and to be
ashamed also to seem so folyshe as to hold them. And for a sample ye author
reherseth dyu^rs / whereof some be new set forth by Tyndall in his english
bokys / wors yet in some p^rte th^n his master Luther is him self.

ANd in good faith I w^ld ^^ne that any good m^n except some reasonable
neces^^^^ should co^^^ell him thereto / else would if he herd but his opinion
onys rehearsed / be very loath to lose his time in the redyng / either of his
fond proof / or of the very tytles and namys thereof again. If they be such in
deed quod your friend and that they be not mistaken or mysreported. Me thinks
quod I that the fruit which ye se spring of them / should suffyse to make you
perceive them for naught. And ywys a fr^rys living ye weddeth a nun when his
living is such / should make yt ethe to wit that his teching is not very good.
Surely quod he I can not say nay but that these be shrewde tokens. I shall quod
I do more for you. For I shall find the meanys that ye shall se his own books
/ and therein perceive yourself that men belie him not. I pray you quod he let
me here some of his opynyons by mouth^ the while / and for the seeing of them
in his own bokys I shall be think me after.

First he bygan quod I with pardons and with the popys power / denyenge finally
any of both to be of any effect at all.

And sone after to show what good spyryte moved him / he denied all the vii.
sacramentys / except baptysme / penance / and the sacrament of the awter /
sayng plainly that all the remanaunt be but feigned thyngys and of none effect.

Now these yt he leueth for good / it is good to se how he handles them. For
in penance he says / that there neither needs contrycyon nor satysfaccyo^.
Also he says that there needs no priest for the heryng of confession / but
that ^uery man and every woman to / is as suffycient to here confession and
assoyle and do all that longs to a confessoure as is a priest.

Mary sir quod your friend this were an easy way for one thing. For the sorest
thing that I find in confes^^on / is that when I see many confessors at a
pardon / yet can I scant like one of them so well upon the fight / that I
would tell any such talys to onys in seven year and I might che^e. But now if
I might after Luthers way be confessed to a fair woman / I would not let to be
confessed wekely. Ye would q I peradventure tell her a tale that ye would not
tell every man. But yet if some men told some talys to a fair woman that they
tell in confession to a foul friar / they would wysh I wene among that they had
kept their counsel in their own breast. Mary quod he that may happen also in
the confession that is made unto a priest. Pos^yble yt were in deed quod I. And
Tyndall in his book of obedience or rather dysobedyence says / that the
curatys do go and show the bishops ye confessyo^s of such as be rich in their
paryshes / and that the byshoppys thervppon do cite them and lay their secret
synnys to their charge / and either put them to open shameful penance / or
compel them to pay at the byshyps pleasure. Now dare I be bold to thy / and
I suppose all the honest men in this realm will say and swear the same / yt
this is a very folysh falshed ymagyned of his own mind / whereof he never saw
the sample in his life. We se in su^ rather the contrary faut / that not only
the rich but the pore also / keep open quenys and live in open aduoutry / with
out payment or penance or any thing almost onys said unto the^. But therwyth
fyndeth Tyndall no faut in the bishops. For he say^ plainly that ye bishop
has none authoryte to (...) any such thing at all. But he lets not on the
the other side to belie the bishops and the curates to / faynyng that the tone
does utter folkys confessyon^ to the the other. And when he has so bylyed them /
then forthwyth as though he had proved his tale true / he takes the same falls
feigned lie for a ground theruppon to byeld the destruccyon of that holy
sacrament of penance. For upon that lie and such other like / he says
plainly that confessyo^ to ye priest is the worst thing yt ever was found. Now
if yt were true as yt is as false as he that said yt / how happed yt than
(which questyon Luther and he be asked often and always make as they herd yt
not) how happed yt I say yt of so many virtuous wise and cunning fathers as
have been in Crystys church in so many hundred yerys / never none had ye wit nor
the grace to spy this great thing / but all teache confession / till now that
Tyndal ca^/which yet in this point (...) his master Luther For he says he
would in any wise have confession stand / but he would have yt made at lybertye
as well to women as men. But Tyndall will have none at al / because he lysteth
to belie both the byshoppys and the curatys / faynyng that they should between
them dysclose our confessyo^s. In faith quod your friend that is a thing that
I never herd to have happened. Nor he neither quod I that dare I boldly say.
And yet I wot well as ye said right now / that prestes should utter folkys
confession were well po^^yble / and in many of the^ nothing in this world more
lykely neither / ^f god and his holy spyryte were not as yt is assystent and
workynge with his holy sacrament. But surely where as there be many thyngys
that (...) and clearly prove the sacrament of co^fe^^^o^ t^ be a thing
instytu^^ and d^^ysed by god / yet^ if all ye remanau^t la^hed / this (...)
things were unto me a plain per^^^syon and a full profe^whyche thing I find
in the noble book that the kyngys hyghnes made against Luther / that is to wit
that in so commen and custom of confession ofter than ^nys in the year / where
no man lets boldly to tell such his secretys / as upon the dyscouerynge or
close keeping thereof his honestye comenly and often time his life also
depends / so many simple as be of that sort yt here them / and in all other
thing so light and laues of their tongue / and some therwyth so lewd in all
their living / that for money they force little to stele rob and murder to
/ and might many times with the dysclosynge of some such thyngys get so myche
as some of them would kill a man for less^/yet find we never any man take
harm by his confession / or cause given of complaynte / through any such
secretts vttred and showed by the confessoure. In good fayth^ quod he this is
very trowthe and a great thing in mine opinion. But vndowtely if confession
came ^ny^ to women's erys / there would be a sore change. For yt would be hard
for god and the devil to / to keep their tongys. Yes yes quod I^ (...) can
keep a counsayll well ynought. For though she tell a gossyppe she tells yt
but in counsel yet / nor that gosseppe to her gosseppe neither / and so when
all the gosseppys in the town ^nowe yt / yet is yt but counsayll still: And
therefore I say yt not for any harm that would come by them but for the
neweltye thereof.

Now in ^rnest quod yo^^ friend this was a myche more mad i^uencyon of
Luther / and that Luther is in a manner as mad as Tyndall. For it were as good
almost to have no ^^nfessyon at all / as to set women to here yt. Forsothe
quod I if yt had been wys^dome and not against gods will / yt would of
lykelyhedde have b^^ founden by some good men before these days / in this
long time of so many hundred yerys. How be yt he gooth nere enough to take
yt all away. And diverse of his scolers bysyde Tyndall do now deny yt
utterly. And him self leueth little substance and little fruit therein. For he
would that we should not care myche for any full confession of all deedly
synnys / nor be very studyouse in the gatherynge of our fawtys to mind / nor
ponderynge the cyrcumstauncys nor the wryght and grauyte thereof / nor taking
any sorrow therefore. Now those thyngys taken away / and the sacrament of
pen^unce left such as he would have yt / consider in your self what fruit
were a man lykely to find in yt / he yt takes a confessoure he forces not
wh^^ / and the^ confesses he forces not what / dysposynge him to ^epentau^ce
he forces not how / good wortkes in satysfaccio^ ^^^ompteth for naught / what
manner of ame^deme^t shall this man cu^ to? and specially if byside all this he
may take to his confessor a fair woman such as a young man would have a lust
to break his mind unto / does yt not playn^ly appear that this fond fellow so
plays with this holy sacrament of penance / that he ^o^th about utterly to
dystroye yt? (...) yet is this one of the th^^ that he loves / taking (...)
expressly. Surely quod your friend so d^^th ^e this to as thinks me. For^^th
quod I and he handeled the sacrament of baptysme not myche better. For he
magnyfyeth baptysme but to the suppressyo^ of penance ^ of all goodlyuyng. For
therein he techeth that the sacrament self has no virtue at all / but the
faith only.

Item he techeth that only faith suffyseth to our saluacyo^ with our baptysme
/ without good works. He says also that yt is sacrylege to go abowte to
please god with any workys and not with faith only.

Item that no man can do any good work.

Item that the good and ryghtuou^^ man always synneth in doing well.

Item that no sin can dampne any christian man / but only lac^e of bylef. For
he says that our faith su^^eth up all our synnys how gre^e so ever they be.

Item he techeth that no man has no fre will / nor can any thing do therwyth /
not though the help of grace be joined thereunto / but that every thing that we
do good and badde / we do nothing at all there in our self / but only suffer
god to do all thing in us good and badde / as were is wrought in to an image or
a candell by the mannys hand without any thing doing there to yt self.

Item he says that god is as verily the author and cause of the evil will of
Judas in betrayeng of Christ / as of the good will of Christ in (...) his p^^^yon.

In matrymony he says playn^ly that yt (...) s^^rament / and so s^y^^e
Tyndall to.

Item that if a man be not able to do his duty to his wife / he is bounden
secretly without sclau^der to provide a another to do yt for him. Forsothand
abque; your friend this was courteys^y considered of him / he is a very
gentylman I (...) you. It is no merueyl though his wife be well ^e^mynge if he
make her such prouysyon. Surely quod I this wise deuyse has he / and myche
other bestelynes^^ he says in such thyngys and his dyscyples after him of
such sort as honest erys coud scant abide the herynge.

In the sacrament of order he says / yt presthede and all holy orders be but a
feigned inuencyon.

Item yt every crys^e^ m^nand every christian woman is a priest.

Item that every man may consecrate the body of Christ. This is a shameful
saying in good faith quod you^e friend. Abide ye q I and ye shall here wurse
yet. For he ferther yt every woman and child may consecrate the body of our
lord. Surely quod he tha^ is the man m^^ outryght. He says quod I ferther yet
/ that the canon of ye mass is false.

Item that ye host in ye mass is none ^blacyon nor sacryfyce.

Item that the mass with his c^no^ after the form that is and ever has been
used in Crystys church / is sacrylege and abomynacyon.

And though myche of this concerns his da^pnable heresies ^o^thi^g y^
blessed sacrament of y^ auter / yet says h^ thereof many lewd doctrynes m^. And
among other he techeth that yt is heresye to believe that there is not very
bread and very wine in the sacrament of the auther ioynyd with the body and
blood of our lord.

Item Swynglius and Ecolam^^dius scolers of Luther have byteded ferther upon
this ungracious ground of their master / and teache that the sacrament of the
altar is not the very body nor blo^d of our lord at all. And Luther him
self all be yt he now writes against them there in / yet (as yt by many
thyngys appears) minded and intended to put forth by laysour the same
heresye him self / till he changed his mind for envy that he bare toward
them / when he saw yt they would be hedys of a sect them self (for that
cowlde he suffer no man to be but him self) But before as I say he did entende
yt himself. And therefore he made a way toward yt by these other heresies that
I have rehearsed you / and by diverse other mo.

For he techeth also that the mass avails no man quyck nor deed / but only
to the priest him self.

Item he techeth that men should go to mass as well after sowper as before
brake fast / and in his commen clothes as he g^^th all day without light or
any other honorable ryte used therein.

Item he says yt were best that men should never be how seled / but onys in
their life. And that never till they lie a dyenge / as they be but onys
crystened / and that at their beginning.

Item he techeth that every man and woman should take the holy sacrament / and
spare not to touch yt and handell yt as much as them list.

Item he says that the blyssed sacrament of the awter is ordained of god to
be received / but not to be worshypped. In faith quod your friend these thyngys
be far owte of course. Yt see quod I now how he handles all the blyssed
sacramentys.

But now has he other wild heresies at large. For he techeth against
scripture and all reason that no christian man is or can be bounden by any law
made among men / nor is not bounden to observe or keep any.

Item he techeth that there is no purgatory.

Item that all me^nys soulys lie still and sleep till the day of dome.

Item that no man should pray to sayntys nor set by any holy relyques nor
pylgrymagys.

By my truth quod your friend I had forgoten / that when I was n^we in the
university in the communycacyon yt I had with my friends there in that matter /
one of them objected against me / that the worship of ymagys have he ere
this condemned by a great counsayll in Greece. There was i^ deed q I^ cou^sayl
onys in gre^e gathered by an emperor / that then was an heretyque there
which was after in the tyghteth Synod by the general counsayll dampened and
adnulled. But this no more does to the matter / the^ if there would now in Saxony
and Swych^rland and such other places such people as swarne fro ye faith g^ther
them self together and keep (...) they would call yt a general counsayll
/wherein they might deter^yne what they would. And yet were all that no preiudyce
to the right believe of the catholyque church / which is always that known
people that still persevere as one body with our savior Christ in their former
fast confermed faith / from which faithful body these other wytherynge
brawnches be blown away by the devil. And therefore as ye cowld make none
authoryte against the true ^ayth of the church / so could that counsel in
great no thing prove their purpose / which made none interrupcyon of the
right believe and godly custume of worship done to sayntys and images / that
yet did for all that co^tynue still in all the catholyke church of Christ /
and ever synnys has done. Forsothe quod he that is troth.

Yet went never q I ye counsel in Greece scysmatycal as yt was any thing so
far as Luther and Tyndall and their company which leave no saint vnblasphemed /
nor Crystys own mother neither.

For Luther can not abide the come^ anthe^ of our lady and the most de^o^t
Salve regina / because we therein call that blyssed vyrgyn our advocate.

Item every other woman now living if she have the same faith may by prayed
unto as our lady / and with her prayer as myche profit us.

Item he techeth that men should do no worship to ye holy cross that Christ
dyed on / saying that if he had yt hole or all the pyecys thereof / he would
cast yt in such a place as no sone should shine thereon / to the end yt should
never be fou^den to be worshypped more.

Item of all s^estys he says yt he hates the feast of the holy cross / and
ye feast of Corpus christi.

He techeth also that no man or woman is bounden to keep and obser^e any vow
that h^ has made to god (...) vyrgynyte / or wydowhed / or other ch^styte out
of marriage / but yt they may mary at their lybertye their vow not
wythstandyng. And how proves ^e that quod your friend? Mary quod I by the
brekyng of his own / when he married the nun^e. And now he rayleth against all
cha^^y^^/and says (...) if a priest ly^e chaste / he is like to the prestys of
the ydole ^ybeles.

Long would yt be to write you all thabomynable heresies of this new sect.
But some of them have I rehearsed / that ye may thereby consider whyther he that
techeth such thyngys / go not about utterly to dystroye the hole ^ayth /
relygyon / and virtue of crystendom. And that he is not in any of these poyntis
bylyed / I shall find ye mean that ye shall se yt in his own bokys. And
there shall ye se how madly h^ laboreth to prove them. Prove them quod your
friend? the substance of these matters be to abomynable to be reasoned. And to
make him hated of all good folk / is enough to here them rehearsed. But I
meruayl me much how he fell in to such an hepe of hyresyes.

The.iii. chapyter.
The author shows by what occasyon that Luther first fell to the deuy^ing of
these heresies. And that the occasyon was such as well declares / that he was
prycked thereto by malice / and ever proceeded from evil to worse / not wyttyng
where to hold him / and yt ^e refuses to stand to the judgment of any folk
erthely concerning the trenth or falsh^d of his opynyons save only him self.

NOw that is somewhat worth to consider / how this lewd friar bygan to fall in
these myscheuous matters, Ye shall understand that there was a pardon obtained
in Saxony / for which pardon as the manner is there / Luther was the precheour
and preched to the people / exhortyng them thereto / and auauncynge the authoryte
thereof all yt he possible might / not without his great advantage therefore. So
happed yt than sone after / that the setting forth of the pardon with
thaduauntage thereof / was taken from him and set to a another. For anger whereof
he fell in to such a fury / y^ forthwyth he bygan to write against all
pardons. How be yt because the matter was new and strange / he bygan first by
way of dowtys and questyons only / submyttyng him self and his writing to the
judgment of the pope / and desyryng to be informed of the troth wheruppo^
wha^ he was by writing answered by ye master of ye popys palace / tha^ waxed
he more wode and fell to raylyng against him / and made also a nother^ book
against the power of the pope / affermyng yt his power upon the church was
never instytute of god / but ordained only by the common consent of cryste^
people for avoiding of scysmys. But yet he said yt all cryste^ men were bounden
to stand and ob^y thereunto / and that ye Bohemes were dampnable heretyques for
doing the contrary. But sone after when he was in such wise answered by good
and cu^nyng men / yt he perceived him self unable to defend that he had
affermed / than fell he from reasonyng to raylyng / and utterly denied that he
had before affermed. And tha^ bygan to write that the pope had no power at all
/ neither by god nor man. And that the Bohemes whom he had in his wrytyngys
before called da^pnable heretykes / were good cryste^ men / and al their
opynyons good and catholyque. Than when he was cyted by the popes holiness to
appear / he appeled to the next general counsel / which should be gathered
in the holy ghost. So that what so ever general counsel were after assembled
/ he might geste and rail thereon / and say yt was not it that he appeled unto
/ for yt was not assembled in the holy ghost. He took quod your friend a good
wyly way As wyly as yt was q I yet would he not stand thereby / but fled from
that to a another. Now shall ye understand / y^ yet sone after this in ye book
by which he not answers but rayleth against that book wherein our sovereign
lord ye king like a most faithful virtuous and most erudyte prince /
euydently and effectually reuynced and confuted the most venomous and
pestylent book of Luther entyteled the captyuyte of Babylon / in which he
laboreth to destroy the holy sacrame^tys of Cristis chyrch^ in that book I say
Luther which had before appeled to then ex^general cou^sayll / utterly denies
the authoryte of all general counsayllys / and sets them all at nowghte.
By my troth quod your friend either was the man very neclygent before / or very
naught after / when he changes so often / and writes ever the longer the
more contrary / not to his adversary only / but also to him self. But I pray
you how excuses he his inconstaunce? Mary quod I he says that he seethe
ferther than he saw before. whereunto the kyngys grace shows him / that yt
were unlikely / that he should se better through a pair of evil spectacles of
ire and envy. Uery true quod your friend by my truth. But yet I here say
that he has offered to stand at the judgment of learned men in all his matters
/ if his offer had been taken i^ time. In deed q I onys he promised to stand to
the judgment of ye university of Paris / and theruppo^ was there open
dyspycyons kept / and the very words written by notaryes swore^ for both the
parties. But when his opynyons were after at Paris by the university condemned
/ than he refused to stand to their judgment / and fell again to his old
craft of raylynge. He appeared also at Wormys before the emperor and the
pryncys of the empire by a sufeconducte. And there recognysed and knowleged as
well the said pestylent book written against the sacramentys / as many other
of like sort to be his own / and offered to abide by them. Which he might
boldly do / being by the saufe conducte in good suretye of him self that he
could take none harm. Than was he moved to dyspycyons upon ye artycles / so
that he should agree upon some persons virtuous and well learned / yt should be
iudgys of that dyspycyons / and that he should be content to stand to their
judgment upon the same. Wheruppon he agreed to come to dyspycyons / but he
would in no wise agree to make any me^ living judges upon it / nor stand to no
ma^nis judgment erthly.

The.iiii. chapyter.
The author shows how yt Luther in the book that him self made of his own
actys at the cite of wormys in almayn / does so madly ouerse him self / yt he
dyscloseth unware certain folyes of him self / which a man will well laugh at
and marvel much to se yt.

ANd that these thyngys be true / yt well appears to all ye world in the book
yt he made him self of his demeanure / and his actys at the city called
Wormys in almayne. Which book who so redeth / shall have a great pleasure to
se therein / both the frantyke vaynglory of ye fond friar / and yet there wythal
to se him carried out with folly so far from him self / that in a line or twain
he dyscouereth all that he went abowte to hyde in all the book bysyde. For ye
shall understand that albeyt he made that book him self / yet he made it so
that he would yt should seem to have been of some other mannys making and not of
his own / to thentent that such worshypfull wordys as he speaks of him self
/ might make him in therys of the reder / seem some honorable person. Which
wordys else he wist well spoken of his own mouth / all ye world would wonder
on. Now in this book bysyde that he leueth out some thyngys there said and
spoken where the wordys written in could do him no worship / and some thyngys
recyteth with advantage for his part / rehersyng ye the other side nakedly and
barely and pared of to make it seem the more slender / one thing he observes
dylygently / that where as speaking of the emperor he calls him never but
symply and syngly charles / he never speaks of him self but he sets forth
his name in great capytall letters and solemn tytles / The Man of God Luther.
And where as they that spoke against his errors / he writes that they brast
out in to vyrulent and venimouse words / when he comes to his own answer /
th^n he writes in this wise / but tha^ D. Martine for his incredyble humanyt^
and bountye answered in this wise benygnely. And sometime with these wordys /
the most benygne father most myldely made answer. And finally he fynysshed and
ends his book as yt were with a Gloria patri to the hole psalm in this wise
/ This holy devout man therefore even borne to teache and preserve the gospel of
god / our lord long preserve for his church with his holy word also Ame^. Now
who was there ever borne so suspycyous that ever would have suspected that he
which wrote such glorious wordys of Luther sh^ld be Luther him self. For
where should a man find so very a vayngloryouse fool / that would not in him
self be ash^med of him self to think such thyngys. But now ye that read this
/ I pray you for gods sake se how utterly this ych and tyklyng of vanyte and
vaynglory had cast him clean bysyde his mind and memory. For where as all
the book bysyde was so dyuysed and h^nd^led / that it should seem some other to
have made yt and not him self / suddenly the fond fellow bewrayed him self
unware. For in one place forgetting him self / he speaks in this wise / When
this was spoken / than the orator of y^ empire in a chydyng manner said that I
had not answered to the purpose / and that those thyngis which had been dampened
and determined in general counsayls of old / ought not now of new to be
brought again in questyon by me / and therefore I should give a plain answer
whyther I would revoke mine errors or not. Than unto this I answered in this
wise. Sith that yt is so. etc. Lo here may ye se the incredyble humylyte and
lowly mind of this most benygne father / which under the vysour of a strange
herald / blows out him self his own boste. Than may ye se therwyth his
meruelouse profounde prudence / that had not the wit to beware that him self
bewrayed not his own so folysh a deuyce / in the vain auauntyng of his own
false boste and praise / that though the wordys had been true / yet would almost
a very natural fool have been ashamed of him self to write them. By my truth
quod your friend this deuyse was madly minded of Luther / and madly handled /
and madly ouersene / to show him self so fond / but if pride as the proverb
is must nedys have a shame.

The.v. chapyter.
The author shows ye parpetual inconstaunce of Luther / and his co^traryete
and repugnaunce against him self.

NOw as for his co^staunce appears quod I by that I have before rehearsed of
his contynuall change i^ his heresies fro day to day / fro worse to worse /
which course he kept not only in the matters above rehearsed / but almoost in
all the remanaunt. For as concerning purgatory / he wrote first that all
though it could not be proved by euydent scripture as he affermed / yet was
there no dowte but that there is purgatory / and that thing he said was of all
christian men fermely to be byleued. And than he wrote y^ he wondered of the
madness of such false and folyshe heretyques as were borne wtin one hundred
year passed / and are not ashamed to deny purgatory / which the hole church
of Christ has byleued this fyftene hundred year. Now what constaunce is there
in this friar / that wrote this of heretyques that deny purgatory / and within
a while after denies yt him self / sayng in the sermon that he wrote of the
rich man and Lazare / that all mennys sowlys lie still and sleep till domys
day.

Mary quod your friend tha^ has some man had a sleep of a fair length. They
will I wene when they wake forgete some of their dremys. By my faith quod I he
that byleueth Luther yt his soul shall sleep so long / shall when he dies
sleep in shrewd rest. I myche marvel quod your friend what evil ayled him to
find out this fond folly. To this opinion quod I / or rather to the faynyng of
this opinion (for I verily think that him self thinks not as he writes) he
fell for envy and hatered that he bare to prestehode / by the malice of which
his ungracious mind / he rather were content that all the world lay in the
fire of purgatory till domys day / than that there were one penny given to a
priest to pray for any soul. This is quod your friend very lykely.

Like constau^ce quod I has he used in the matter of holy vows. For in his
book of the captyuyte of Babylon / he writes that neither man nor angel is
able to dyspense with the vow made by man to god. And sone after he wrote that
no vow cowlde bind any man / but that every man may boldly break them of
his own head. But yt well appears that he wrote the first of anger and malice
toward the pope / and than changed to the second of a lecherous lust to the
nun that he minded to mary.

The.vi. chapyter.
The author shows how y^ Luther has be feign for the defense of his
vndefe^cyble errors / to go back and forsake all the manner of proof and trial
/ which he first promised to stand to. And now like a man shamfull and
shameless / has no proof in the world but his own word / and calls that
the word of god.

HIs inconstaunte wit and very deuylyshe intent specially showed yt self / by
this also which I shall now rehearse you. In the beginning ye man had the mind
that comenly such foles have / he rekened all the world wild gese save him
self / and all the wit and lernyng to stand in his own head. And than wenynge
that he should find no match / but that he should as he list be able to prove
ye mo^e made of grene chese / he professed in his bokis yt he would for ye proof
or reprove of his opynyons / stand to natural reason / to the authoryte of the
old holy fathers / the laws and canons of Crystys church / and to the holy
scripture of god with thinterptacyo^s of ye old holy doctors. But so^e after
wha^ he^ perceived him self in his opinion deceived / and that he saw him self
confuted and concluded euydently both by scripture / natural reason / the
lawys and determynacyons of the church / and the hole consent of the holy
fathers interpretours of holy scripture / than byga^ he to sing a another song.
For than as for reason he refused to stand to / saying that the matters of our
faith be thyngys above reason / and that reason hyndereth us in our faith / and
is unto faith an enmy. And as for the laws of ye church / he with other
blasphemouse heretyques burned up openly at ^ytte^berge / syn^^nge in derysyon
a dyryge about the fire for ye lawys soul. And tha^ would he stand ^^nothyng
but only scrypture^ not to that neither but if yt were very plain and euydent.
But now if yt were in questyo^ whyther the scripture were euydent^ for him or
against him / there in would he stand to no mannys judgment but his own. For as
for the hole faith of Cryrstys church continued by so many hundred yerys / he
set utterly at naught / calling yt mennys deuyees. And in scripture the
interpretacion of saint Hierome / saint Austayne / saint Ambrose / and all the
old holy fathers of so many yerys passed / he no thing would esteem / ^ut with
blasphemouse wordis let not to write / I care not for Austayn / I care not
for an hundred cypryanes / I care not for a thousand Hieromis / I care not but
for scripture alone / and that is plain on my part. As though none of these
old holy cu^nynge men had understand any scripture till he came. Now was he by
this unreasonable manner dreue^ to a another deuylysh deuyce against sayntys. For
to thentent that their authoryte should no by the devotion and reverence that
all good men bear them mynysh his crede^ce / he was forced to labor to bring
men in ye heresye that they should pray to no sayntys / but would have their
ymagys drawn down all / their pylgrymagys left up / all their relyques cast
out / all their honor and mennys devotion toward them wythdrawe^ / so
ferforth that he could neither abide the honor of our blessed lady / nor the
holy cross / nor Crystys blyssed body / as plainly declares his abomynable
bokys.

The.vii. chapyter.
The author shows what thyngys caused ye people to fall in to Luthers fond
and furyouse sect. And he shows also what myschyef the folowers of that
sect have done in Almayne / Lombardy / and Rome.

IT is quod your friend a wonder to me / that the people being before brought
up in the right bylyefe / cowlde find in their hartys to give him audyence in
some such heresies as these be. Ye must understand and may perceive quod I
that he did not set forth all at onys. But as Tyndale has bygonne here in
england with ye thing that had a good vysage / though he had corrupted yt and
meant naught in deed / putting for the first the new te^^ament in such wise
handled / that unlearned folk were lykly to take harm and conceive diverse
heresies in their hartys / ere they cowlde perceive his falshed / and than has
synnys by.ii. other bokys openly showed him self to lack nothing of Luther /
but that he has not yet married a nu^ne / so did Luther also put forth in ye
beginning no more but the matter of pardons as I told you / and therein nothing
a^fermed neither against the determynacion of ye church / but submytted him
self there to. Now with this demeanure was there no man offended. But yet did
he that time entende a ferther myschyef / which he little and little pursued
and brought to pass. And one specyal thing with which he spyced all the
poison / was the lybartye that he so hyghly commended unto the people /
brynging the^ in believe that having faith / they neded nothing else. For as
for fasting / prayer / and such other thyngys / he taught them to neglecte
and set at naught as vayn and unfruitful ceremonies / techynge them also that
being faithful crystyens / they were so nere cosyns to Christ / that they be
in a full fredome and lybartye dyscharged of all governors and all manner lawys
spyrytuall or temporal / except the gospel only. And albe yt he said that of
a specyal perfeccyo^ yt should be well done to suffer and bear the rule and
authoryte of popys pryncys and other governors / which rule and authoryte he
calls but only tyranny / yet he says that the people be so fre by faith /
that they be no more bounden thereto / then they be bounden to suffer wrong. And
this doctrine also techeth Tyndall / as the special matter of his holy book of
dysobedyence. Now was this doctrine in Almayn of the comen vplandysh people so
pleasauntly herd / that yt blinded them in the lokynge the remenaunt and
could not suffer them to consider and se what end the same would in conclusyon
cu^ to. The temporal lordys were glad also to here this gere against the
clergy / and the people as glad to here yt against the clergy / and against
ye lordis to / and against all their governors of every good town and city.
And finally so far went yt forward / that at the last yt bygan to brast out and
fall to open force and vyolence. For ente^di^g to bygyn at ye feblest / there
gathered them together for yt setting forth of these ungracious heresies / a
boystyous company of that unhappy sect / and first rebelled against an abbot /
and after against a bishop / wherwyth the temporal lordys had good game and
sport and dyssembled the matter / gapynge after the landys of the spyrytualtye
/ till they had almoost played as Esope tells of the dog / which to snach
at the shadow of the chese in the water / let fall and lost ye chese that he
bare in his mouth. For so was yt shortly after that those vplandysh lutheranys
took so great boldness and so byga^ to grow strong / yt they set also upon the
temporal lordys. which had they not set hand thereto yt sooner while they looked
for other mennys landys / had been like shortly to lose their own. But so
quyt they themself / yt they slew upon ye poi^t of.lxx. thousand lutheranys in
one somer / and subdued the remau^t in that part of Almayn to a right
miserable seruytude. How be yt in the mean while many myscheuous dedys they
did.

And yet in diverse other parties of Almayne and swycherlande / this ungracious
sect by the neclygence of ye governors in great cytyes / is so ferforth grown
/ that finally the common people have compelled the rulers to follow them / whom
if they had take heed in time / they might have ruled and led. And now is yt to
pyteouse a syghte to se the dyspytuous dyspyghtys done there in many placys to
god and all good men / with yt marvelous change from all face and fasshyon of
crystendom / in to a very tyrannous persecucyon / not only of all good christian
people quyck and deed / but also of Christ him self. For there shall ye se now
the goodly monasteryes destroyed / the placys burned up / the relygyous people
put out and sent to seek their living / or in many cytyes the placys yet
standing / with more dyspyte to god than if they (...) myche ernest bysynes for
to have some money with her. And whyther he gate ^ug he or gate naught by that
deuyse / he let not sone after to putt^ the father / the mother / the fair
daughter and all the hole house to new tormentys / to make them tell where any
more money were / were there any or none. And some failed not to take the child
and bind yt to a broche / and lay yt to the ^^re to ro^^^/the father and
mother lokynge on. And th^n begin to come^ of ^ price for the sparynge of the
child / asking first an hundred ducatys / tha^ fyfty / than forty / than
twenty / than ten / than five / than tw^yn / wha^ the sely father had not one
left / but these tyr^untys had all before. Than would they let the child roste
to death. And yet in derysyon as though they py^yed the child they would say
to the father and the mother / Ahfy fie for shame what mer^ayle is yt though god
send ^ veng^ance among you. What unnatural people be you that can find in
your hartys to se your own child roasted before your face / rather tha^ ye would
out with one ducate to deliver yt from death.

Thus d^uysed these cursed wreches so many diverse fassyons of exquysyt^
crueltees / y^ I wene they have taught the devil new tormentys in hell / that
that he never knew before / and will not fayll to prove him self a good
scoler / and surely render them his lesson when they come there / where yt is
to be fered that many of them be by this. For sone after that they had in Rome
exc^rcysed a while this fyerce and cruel tyranny / and en^red in to the holy
chyrchys / spoiled the holy relyques / cast ow^ the blessed sacrament / pulled
the chalyce from th^u^er at mas^^/slain prestys in the church / left no kind
of cruelte or spyte undone / but from hour to hour embruynge their handys in
blood / and that in such wise as any turk or Sarycyne would have pytyed or
abhorted / our lord sent sone after such a postylence among them that he
lest not of them the third part alive. For this purpose I rehearse you this
theyr^ h^uy mysche^ous delyng / that ye may perceive by their dedys / what
good comes of their sect. For as our sauyor says ye shall know the tree by
the fruit.

The.viii. chapter.
The messenger says that the m^lyce of the men is not to be imp^ted to the
sec^e / sith that of every sect some be naught. And the author shows that in
the lutheranys / ye sect^ self is the cause of the malice that the men fall to.

Sir quod your friend in good faith I neither ca^ nor will defend that sect.
But yet reason yt is to take every thing as yt is. And if yt be naught / yt
has the les^e need to be made worse. But as for the malycyous cruel dealing
of me^ of war / is not in my mind to be imputed to the sect^ of Luther. For
there is no sect so sayntly / but they fall to cruelte when they fall to watre.
And of every sect also be some badde. And therefore ye malice of the m^n is not
as me seems to be imputed unto ye sect. It is not q I all one to be sum
naught and all naught. But they that fall to this sect / wax ^^^ght all the
hole mayny. For forth with upon this sect ones begone / the (...) ^tockys of
such as were infecte therwyth / ^ell unto those myscheuous dedys that I before
rehearsed you. And also though me^ in war wax furyouse and cruel / yet was
there never none that went there inso far / and specially in such kind of
crueltye as has been among christian men in their war always forborne / as is
the dyspytes done to ye blessed sacrament / wherein these bestys were more hot
and more busy than would the great Turk / and yt bycawse their sect is yet
in manner worse than his. More over ye unhappy dedys of that sect must nedys
be imputed to the sect self / while the doctrine thereof techeth and gives
occasyon to their evil dedys. A christian mannys evil living can not be
imputed to his crystendome. For his living is contrary to the doctrine and
living of Christ. But as for the doctrine of this unhappy sect and the
living also of the begynners of the same is such / as every wise man well
perceyueth / does teache and give occasyon of their evil dedys. For what good
deed shall he study or labor to do that byleueth Luther that he has no fre
will of his own / by which he can with help of grace either work or pray?
Shall he not say to him self that he may sit still and let god alone?

what harm shall they care to forbere / y^ believe Luther / that god alone
without their will works all the myschyef that they do them self?

what shall he care how long he live in sin / that byleueth Luther / that he
shall after this life neither fel^ well or ill in body nor soul till the day
of dome? Will not he trow you say as the Welsheman said? If thou give her
that day / by god Dauy will have thy cote to. And this thing I say but for a
sa^ple. For look his opynyons through / and ye shall find yt they plainly set
forth all ye world to wredched living. If they would say yt we mys^^ constrew
their words / their books be open / and the wordys plain / and inculked
again and again so often and so openly ye men can not err therein / nor they
by any cloak or color defend them.

And bysydys that not only the co^enaltye of their sect show the effect and
fruit of their doctrine by their abomynable dealyng as I have rehearsed you /
but also the doctors and the arche heretyques them self / well declare the
holiness of their doctrine by their own lyui^g. For as they live they teache /
and as they teache they live.

The author shows that yt is a great token yt the world is nere at an end /
while we se ye people so far fallen fro god / yt they can abide yt to be content
with this pestylent frantyke sect / which no people christian or hethen could
have sufferd before our days.

IF the world were not ne^e at an end / and the fervor of devotion so sore
coled y^ yt were almost quenched among cryste^ people / yt could never have
come^ to pass yt so many people should fall to the folowi^g of such a bestly
sect. For albe yt yt ye machometanes being a sensual and fylthy sect / did in
few years draw ye great part of ye world unto yt / by ye self same ways which
now ye luthera^s use / that is to wit voluptuouse living and vyolence /
offering delight unto the recey^ours and death to the re^usours^ yet was there
before this abomynable sect never any sect so shameless / that would still
^uowe them self for christian folk granting the scripture to be true / and
therwythall so enemyously blaspheme and oppugn ye church of Christ / ye
sacrame^tis of Christ / the sayntis of Christ / ye cross of Christ / the mother
of Christ / and the holy body of Christ / so shamfully living and openly
profes^ynge a bestyall manner of living / clean contrary to the doctrine and
life of Christ. Cha^ryanys / the Pelagyanys / the Manytheis / and so forth
every sort of heretyques / bygan of such as though they wyckedly erred in
substauncyall artycles of the faith / yet was their outward fassyon of
living so honest and spyrytuall in appearance / that me^ thought them self
bounden the better to believe their doctrine as christian / for some spyrytual
form and fassyon of their cryste^ living. But now ye chyefteyns of these
execrable heresies / both teache and use more sensual and lycencyous lyui^g /
tha^ ever did Machomet. which though he license me^ to many wyuis / yet he
never taught nor suffered his folk to break their chastyce promised onys and
solempnely dedycate to god. where as L^ther not only techeth monkys ^re^ys and
nonnes to ma^yage / but also being a fre^e has married a ^unne him self /
and with her lives under the name of wedlock in open incestuouse lechery
wythowte care or shame / bycawse he has procured and gote^ so many shameful
and shameless companyons.

who coud have bydde^ to look any man in ye face yt should have don thus in
saint Hieromes and saint Austyns days? what speak we of saint Hierom and saint
Ansteyn? who durst have don it for sh^^^e any time synnys Cry^^ys birth until
our wreched days? Or who synnys Adams time among the chosen people of god?
What speak we of the chosen people of god? the very Paynyms and Paganys
ydolaters kept their chastyte vowed onys to their false goddys / and rather
ch^se to cut of the me^bres with which they might break yt than to stand in
the ieopardy to break yt. And in Rome of old time when they were Paganis / if
any vestal vyrgyn (for so called they their nuns) were vyola^ed / they not
only bette the man to death with roddys in the market place / and beryed the
woman quycke / but also rekened it for a wonderful monster / and a token of
wrath and indygnacyon of their goddys toward their cite and empire / putting
theruppon them self in devour with open processyons and prayers and sacrefyce
/ to procure the recouerye of their goddys favor. Is it not than now a
wonderouse case to se / synnys that the chastyte promised ^nys to god / and
also to the false ydols under the name of god / has always ben sith the world
bygan / among christian and hethen so hyghly esteemed / that the brekers thereof
have always ben by the comm^ne consent of the hole world / as a thing taught
by god unto good men / and by nature to all men taken / reputed / and punysshed
as abomynable wicked wredches / is yt not I say now a wonderouse thing to se
that in ye flok of cryste^ple / which by Christ himself / by all his apostles /
by all his holy martyrs / confessors / and doctors / by all his hole church /
all y^ hole time of these.xv.C. years passed / chastyte has be^ more hyghly
praised and estymed than ever yt was of any other sect sith the world bygan /
we should se now a lewd friar so bold and so shameless to mary a nun and bide
thereby / and be taken still for a christian man / and over that for a man mete to
be the begynner of a new sect / whom any honest man should vouche^^^fe to
follow? If our lord god / whose wysdom is infynyte / should have sit and
studied to deuyse a way / whereby he might cast in our face the confusyon of
our folly / how might he have founden a more effectual / openly to show us the
shame of our sin / than to suffer us that call our self christian folk / to se
such a rabble spring up among us / as professynge the faith and relygyon of
Christ / let not to set at nowght all the doctors of Crystys church / and
lene to the only authoryte of friar tuk and mad Maryon?

The author in^^yeth against this detestable article of this vngracyus sect /
whereby they take away the lybertye of mannys fre will / and ascrybe all thing
to desteny.

SUrely as I say this world is either after the wordys of saint John^ /
Cotuspositus in maligno / all set in malice / yt we be so prone wyttyngly to
take so wrong a way / or else is yt in a meruelouse blyndnesse / if we can
neither perceive by ye nowghty living of the persons that their sect is
nowght / nor can percey^e by their doctrine that their sect must make their
persons naught / their heresies being such as ye have herd. whereby every man
that any faith has and any manner knowledge of christian bylyefe / may well and
surely perceyu^ that Luther and all his of spring / ^ all those that favor
and set forth his sect / be very lymmes of the devil / and open enemies to
the faith of Christ. And not only to the faith and manhood of our savior
Christ / but also against the holy ghoost and the father him self / and utterly
against all goodness of the godhede / as those that wrechedly lay all the wight
and blame of our sin to the necessyte and constraynt of goddys ordonaunce /
affyrmynge that we do no sin of our self by any power of our own will /
but by the compulsyo^ and handy work of god / And that we do not the sin our
self / but that god does the sin in us him self. And thus these wredched
heretyques with this blasphemouse heresye alone / lay more vylaynouse rebuke to
y^ great majesty of god / than ever any one rybaulde laid unto a another. For
who was there ever that laid unto a another all the par^yculere evil dedys of
any one other man / where these ^ybawldys lay to the charge and blame of god /
all the malice and myschyefe from the first fawt to the last / that ever was
wrought or thought by man woman or d^uyll? And by this give they wredches great
boldness to follow their foul affeccyons / as thyngys after their opinion
more verily wroughte in them by god / than the best myndys be in good men.
And that yt were therefore in vayn for them to resyste their synnefull
appetytys. And if they shall be dampened / yet they say yt shall be long or they
feel yt. For Luther says yt al souls shall sleep and feel neither good nor bad
after this life till domes day^ and tha^ they yt ^hal be dampened / shall be
dampened he says for no deserui^g of their own deeds / but for such evil deeds
as god only forced and co^streyned the^ unto and wrought in the^ him self /
vsyng the^ i^ all those evil deeds but as a deed instrument / as a man heweth
with an hachet. And ye god shall da^pne all y^ shall be dampened for his own deeds
only which hi^ self shall have done i^ the^ / and finally for his only pleasure
because yt lyked him not to chose the^ as he did his chose^ people. who^ they
say yt he chose in such wise before ye bygynnyng of ye world / that they can
never sin.

The messe^ger says yt how so ever Luther and his folowers in Almayn believe /
yet he ca^ not think yt such as be Lutheranis in England / of who^ su^ he
says have seemed good and honest be so mad and unhappy to believe yt all ha^geth
upon desteny. wheruppo^ y^ author shows y^ contrary / and yt they be naught
in deed seem they never so good. and for proof yt how so ever they color
their words they mean yt all depends upon only desteny / he reherseth a
certain dyspycyo^ had with an heretyque detected to the bishop and examyned /
the author being present / where the heretyque being learned and a prechoure /
made many shyf^ys to make yt seem that in his evil wordys he meant but well.

WHa^ your fre^d had herd all this he said at last yt albeit y^ words of
Luther seemed very plain toward ye afferming of such opynyo^s / yet were ye
thyngis so far out of all frame / yt yt gave him occasyo^ to dowt le^t Luther
me^t not al thing so evil as his w^^dys seem to way to. And if he so meant him
self with other of his flok and affynyte in Almayne / yet thought your friend yt
such as here favor and follow his sect in England / of who^ su^ seem right
honest and far from his manner of lyui^g / do not so take his wordys nor
understand the^ y^ way / but construe the^ to su^ better sense. Forsooth q I
they ca^ not but kno his open lyui^g in lechery with his lewd le^ma^ y^ nu^ne.
And yt all ye captains of ye sort / su^ late cartusie^ces / su^ obseruau^tys /
su^ of other relygio^s / and all now apostatas and wedded / live i^ like manner
and teache other the same. And by this ca^ they not dout but y^ their doctrine
is naught / except the^ self allow yt way for good. now as for their own goodness
ye find few yt fall to ye sect / but y^ sone after they fall in to ye contempt of
prayer and fasting and of all good workys under ye name of ceremonies. And if
any do other wise / yt is for some purpose for the while to blind the people
and keep theymselfe in favor / while they may find the time by leysoure to
fassyon and frame them better to their purpose / which in the beginning if they
showed the^ self plainly / could happily not abide to here the^. Of which
their demeanure / and that in these heresies they mean here no better tha^
Luther does him self / I have had good experye^s / and among many other things
this yt I shall show you. It happed me to be lately present / where as one in
ye Lutheranes bokis depely lerned^and of troth neither in holy scryptur nor in
secular lytterature unlearned / as I perceive not only by ye testymony of other
men and by ye degrees yt he had taken in the university / but ^^o by his
wordys and his writing / was in the presence of right honorable virtuous and
very cunnyng perso^^ e^^^^ned. For he was at that time in ward for heresye /
because that b^yng learned and using to here confessyons / and among many folk
met^ly well allowed in prechi^g / and thereby growyng in good ^pynyo^ and favor
of many good sympl^ people / abused all these o^e^ and apparent good things /
to ye secret sowyng and ^^^ti^g forth of Luthers heresies. And had for ye
intent not only taught and written and c^uertly corrupted diverse light and lewd
persons / but also had bought great number of ye ^okes of Luther / and wyclyffe
/ Hu^^^/and zuynglyus / and such other heretyques / ^ of many one sort diverse
books / to be delivered (...) he coud find occasion unto yo^g scolers of the
vnyuersytees / such as he thought of iouth and lightness most lykely to be sone
corrupted. This man I say being examined and long kepi^g himself close from
dysclosyng of ye matter / and more ready to go strayte to ye devil with ^^e^g and
false forsweri^g / tha^ to be aknowe^ of his evil demeanure and confess ye
tr^^th / at ye last perceyui^g y^ matters pertely by ye co^fessyo^ of other folk
/ pertely by his own hand wri^i^g / so ferforth come^ to light yt they coud i^
no wise be cloked / tha^ ^^ga^ he su^ what plainly to confess and declare /
not only what he had d^n for ye setti^g forth of y^ sect / but also pertely
what opynio^s he and other his felows had holde^ and were of. Setti^g never ye
les^^ all ye colors he coud to make yt seem / ye though ye w^^dys which they
spa^e or wrote (...) strange and contrary to rygh^^ byle^^/yet the^fect of
their meaning was not much dyscrepant from the true fayth^ of Crystys church.
How be yt wh^^ he was reasoned wtal / and saw yt he coud (...) ^ so shyfte yt
of / but yt for any colour^ (...) could find one part of his tale ever
contraryed a another / at last he showed plainly their opynio^s / and laid forth
as in part for his own excuse as things enducyng him thereto / all ye textes
of scripture / by which they pte^d to perue their ^pynyo^s true. Among which
opynyo^s wha^ he came to thopynyo^ / by wh^che they hold ye only faith alone
is suffycyent wtoute good workys / unto yt he said in ye begi^ni^g yt they me^t
nothing else thereby / but ye men should put their faith i^ gods ^^^ses and
hope to be saved thereby and yt they should not put their trust i^ their works /
for yt would turn the^ t^ pride. The^ was yt a^swerd him yt he and his felows
could not mean so. For if they did / thou could they not blame ye church as
they do / making as though ye chirch had all this while hid ye t^^e faith from
ye people / and yt the^ self were now shent for pchyng ye ^^^spell truly. For
if this were their meni^g / they the^ me^t none other the^ every come^ pchor of
ye church has always pched before luthers dais. For what pchor has not told ye
people yt perable of ye pore publyca^ ashamed of his l^nys / and ye proud
pharysey bosti^g of his virtues? who has not bod the^ do wel^ And albe yt ye
god will reward the^ for their good deeds / yet put not their trust i^ the^
self and their own deeds / but i^ goddys goodnes^ who has not told the^ yt
they should as god bids the^ i^ ye gospel yt wha^ they have done all yt they
ta^ do / yet say to the^ self we be but vnprositable seruau^^^/we have done but
our dutre. These things and such other y^ church has always taught / against
ye puttyng of a proud trust in our own deeds / because yt we ca^ not always
surely judge our own deeds for ye bli^d favor yt we ^ere toward our self and
therefore was it said to him / ^f ye move but thus as the church m^^eth / than
would ye preche but as the church precheth / and not blaspheme ye church in
your sermons / as though y^ ^yg^n true prechynge of the gospel / and that the
church had hitherto preched false. And also ye must nedys mean su^ other
thing. For Luther whose sect ye confess that ye have lened unto / writes in
this matter ^a^re otherwise. For he says plain that faith alone without any
good workys does iustyfye us and suffyseth for our salvation. Then answered he
that there in they meant none other / but that faith is suffycyent alone / if
one happen after he have faith and baptysme to dye e^e he have time to do eny^
good works. Tha^ was yt said unto him / if they should ^^che this opinion
under such wor^ys for a great secrets mystery new found out / and thereby
blame ye church for mys^^^hy^ge the people / as though ye church taught them
to put less trust in god and in faith of Christ tha^ they should do / and
induced them to put their trust in them self and their own good workys / they
used them self meruelously / considering that if they ine^t none other / the
church and they meant all one thing. But they cowlde not mean so. For than why
should they blame the church / that says not the contrary. And also if they
meant none other thing / few wordys would serve them. They should not need so
often to speak thereof. For than that tale can do little good here or any where
else where folk be crystened i^ their cradels. For either they dye ere they
have time to do good workys / and than they be to young to here that sermon /
or else they ly^e and have time to do good workys. And than that sermon were
not wholesome for them / that good workys need not but only faith is suffycyent
without them. And when the people take it as ye speak yt / that faith alone is
enough for them / than is yt now a bare gloss for you to say that ye m^^t not
so / but only that faith alone had be^ enough for them / if they had dyed in
their swadlyng clowtis. To this he said that they thought also yt faith alone
does iustyfye a man without any good workys / not only in chyldr^^ but also
in every age. For when so ever a man that has been a sinner does repent and
amend in his mind with a full faith in the promysys of god / he is iustyfyed
ere ever he do any of these good workys / almoyse / fasting / or any suc^e
other. For he can not work well till he be good all ready. For as Christ says
/ Arbor mala non potest bonum ^ructu^ ^acere / an evil tree can not bring forth
good fruit / and therefore sithe good workys be good fruit / an evil man can
not work them. Whereby yt appears well that the man is iustyfyed before by
his faith alone ^oute the workys / and the^ out of that faith grows the good
fruit of good workys. But faith did iustyfye the man before / and the man was
as good before the workys as he is after. For his faith did iustyfye him. And
as for the workys be but thyngys that the faith in the man or the man by the
faith brings forth / as the tree brings forth his seuys and can do none
other / faith being in ye heart. Then was yt said unto him that in this tale he
seemed to make the good workys to be much like a shadow that the body makes of
ne^^^^ while yt stands in the senne and is never the better therefore. And
then was yt asked him whyther a (...) must not if his faith shall serve him
(...) charity therwyth and a purpose to do good works. ^^s quod he that he
must if he have age and dyscrecyo^ the^ to. Then was yt answered him that then
was all goone that him self had ^ayd before. For than did not faith alone
iustyfye the man / but the charity wy^h the purpose of good works / m^^^^ by
his own grauntyng nedys go there with / or else would his faith iustyfye
nothing at all. For if he had never so grete^ faith and never so sure a bylyef
in goddys promyses / yet if he purposed to do no good dedys therwyth / but
peradventure harm / he should have little iustyfycacyon by his ^nly faith. And
therefore yt was false that he had said a man is never ye better for his good
workys / whyl^ his good workys be so taken and rep^ted with god / that the
purpose of them yet undone so farforth works to his iustyfycacyon / that with
out that purpose he ca^ not be iustyfyed. And yt is also false that he said
that ^aythe alone iustyfyeth a man / when him self is fayn to gra^^t that
faith without charity and purpose of good works ca^ not justify / which is
a^^ with to say as faith alone can not iustyfye. To this he answered yt he had
said that faith only was suffycyent / and that faith alone does iustyfye /
because that if a man had faith / yt could not be but yt he should work good
works. For faith he said could never be ydel / as the fire must nedys burn
and gy^e hete. And therefore as a man may say the fire is enough to burn^ a
tree though he speak nothing of hete / and yet the fire does yt by h^te / and a
(...) may say ye fire makes me se by night and yet the fire does yt but by
the light / so may a man say that faith does save us / though faith do ye
without hope and charity and other virtuous workys / bycawse that faith has
always good hope and charity with yt / and can not but work well / no more than
the fire can be without h^te and light and burn all combustyble thyngys yt it
may tow^he and ^ary with. Then was yt said unto him that albeyt a man might so
speak by ye fire / yet would not this thing serve their sect^. For he that
says fire alone is enough to burn / would not say nay to him that would say
the fire could not burn but if had hete. But your sect scorneth and ^lameth
the church / because the church says that faith will not suffyse but y^ yt
have charity and good workys. For else ye had no cause in this matter to preche
contrary to the church. More ^uer where ye say that faith has always good hope
with yt / that seems not always true. For he that hops yt by faith alone he
shall be saved with out any good workys / as Lutheranys do believe in deed / he
has an evil hope and a damp^^ble. Now where ye say that ye pr^ch^/faith alone
to be suffycyent bycawse that faith has always charity joined therwyth / if
this were true / why preche ye not as well that charity alone is suffycyent /
which were as nere the troth as the t^cher. Now where ye make all the ground
upon this / that faith has ever charity therwyth / and that yt can not be but
that charity which is in deed ye thing that specially brings forth good
workys much more properly tha^ faith / for ^^th brings them forth by charity
when it is joined therwyth / as the apostle says / Fides que per dilectionem
operatur / faith works by cheryte where ye say yt can not be but yt this
charity is always joined unto faith / this ground will fail you / and make
all your foundacyon false / and all your byldyng fall. Thapostell Poule i^ many
placis of his epystles says the contrary thereof. For he says that if a man
have so great faith that he might by the force of his faith work miracles /
and also such fervent affection to y^ faith y^ he w^ld give his body to the
fire for the defense thereof / yet if he lacked chary^e / all his faith suffysed
not In good faith quod your friend he was well and proprely answered. But yet
me thi^keth he might have replied a little again to those wordys of saint
Poule / and might have avoided them well with other wordys of his own. For
where he writes also to y^ Galathes / y^ if any angel would com down from
heaven and preche a contrary gospel to that that he had preched all ready /
acoursed should he be and not to be byleued / he did not in these wordys a^ferme
nor entend thereby yt ever yt should so be / or could so be / that any angel so
should do in deed. For he knew right well yt was impossyble that any angel of
heaven should come down and tell a false tale. But he said yt only by a manner
of speking which is among learned men called yperbole / for the more vehement
expressyng of a mater^ no thing menyng else but y^ the gospel which he had
preched / was the plain sure and vndowtable troth / against which no man were
to be byleued. And in like wise me thinks the man that ye spe^e of might have
said / y^ though saint Poule said / If he had so great faith y^ ^e were able
thereby to remove hyllys / except he had cheryte therwt yt would not serve him
he meant thereby no more but to show y^ great need that men have to cheryte / and
not that yt were possible that faith could be without cherite / no more than he
meant that an angel may come down from heaven to preche a false faith. And
therefore might yt yet stand right well with all those wordys of saint Powle
/ that faith can not fail of salvation / sith yt can not fayll of charity.
And of troth m^ seems as that man said that fayt^ can not be idle but yt must
nedys work well. Forsooth quod I the man lacked you there / for he found not
that gloss. Which though he had / yet would yt not have served him. For between
those two placys of saint Powle y^ there great dyfference. For in the t^n^ is
there an impossyble excess and yperbole / in the the other is there not so. For
angels of heaven never can come down and teache a false faith. But faith may be
s^uered from charity. And in y^ tone place he none other thing intended than
as ye say to show by that great exceeding word / the undoubted troth of the
faith which him self had preched. But in the the other place his specy^ll purpose
was to teache the Galath^^s / that they should neither trust y^ any gift of
nature / or gift of god above nature / or any manner virtue / alm^yse deed /
faith / or other / were able to stand them in ^^^de wytho^t cheryte. And this
did he specially / for that he would that no man should be in such error / as
to reken that either excellent gift of eunnynge / great labor spent in
prechyng / great almoyse spent^ on pore people / or a very fervent faith /
might suffyse to their saluacyo^ if cheryte lakked. Against which error he
does in such wise exhort them to cheryte / in avoydyng the rankour / which by
occasyon of scysmes did arise among th^^ that ^e showed them precysely / y^
without cheryte they lost clearly the merit of all their other virtues and
gracys y^ god had given them / cu^nyng / almoyse deed / faith / and all /
puttyng thexample by his own self / which though he were a chosen servant
and apostle / yet y^ he were i^ langage egall wythall y^ hole world and with
angellys to / and had all y^ cu^nyng that possible could be had / and the
spirit of all prophecye therwyth / and would give all his goodys in almoyse /
and had also all the full faith so great that yt su^^yced to work wundres with
/ and so fervent that he would abide to be burned for yt / yet if he laked
cheryte / all this would not serve him. So that ye may se now that your gloss
would not have releued this man. For though none angel could come down and
teache an untruth / and therefore the wordys yt ye allege can be none otherwise
taken than as ye say by way of exce^^^ and yperbole / to declare the vehemence
of his mind in the matter of faith which he than spoke of / yet this other
place of saint poule that was laid against that heretyque that I speak of / as
great and vehement as the wordys be / yet do they plainly prove that the
apostle shows / y^ faith may be without cheryte / and that does so great that
yt may suffyse to y^ doing of great wonders / and so fervent that yt may suffer
a paynful death / and yet for f^wte of charity not suffycye^t to s^^^^cyon / and
that this may hap as well in faith as in almoyse deed / which y^ appostle
puts in the same case. And therefore where that man said and ye seem to
conferme the same / that faith can not be idle from y^ workyng of good workys /
the appostle to show the contrary / and that all y^ workys of faith though
they seem never so good / be yet naught in deed if they be not wrought with
charity / co^me^dith only ye faith yt workyth by charity / sygnyfye^g yt all
other works of faith be not auaylable. And surely faith alone wythowt charity
may be bysydys this not only idle with out the busynes of good workys / but also
for lack of good workys yt may be utterly deed. And therefore as it was there
objected unto that man / y^ holy appostle James says to them that teken faith
suffycye^t for saluacyo^ with out good workys / that they be worse tha^
deuyls. For he says yt y^ deuyls do believe / and tremble for y^ fere of god.
And y^ men which by ye hope and boldness of their believe think their faith
without good works suffycyent / be worse than deuyls / bycawse they stand out
of dread of god / that mana^^eth unto the^ the pains of hell except they do
good workys. Without which saint Iamys for a fynall conclusyon says that the
faith is but deed.

After such resonyng the man said yt he and the other Lutheranys wha^ they spoke
that only faith was suffycyent / they mean not of a deed faith that is
without charity and good workys / but a very faith that is quycke and works
by charity / and that such faith he thought was suffycye^t. But than was yt
answered / that neither they nor he could mean so. For how could they call
that thing faith only that is joined with charity and good workys? Or how
can yt stand that they mean that faith which by charity works good workys
/ when they say that yt is suffycyent alone without good workys / and that yt
is as Luther says great sin and sacrylege to to go about to please god by
good workys / and not by only faith? How coud they say that only faith
suffyseth / if they should mean that without charity and good workys no faith
suffyseth For yt were a mad thing to say that faith alone suffyseth without
good workys / and therwt to say y^ with out good workys faith suffyseth nothing.
And so was yt said unto him that therefore though they color their matters wha^
they be examyned / yet it can not be but that he and other Lutheranys where
they sow their heresye / mean plainly as they speak / y^ folk need no more
but believe / and than how so ever they live shall make no matter. For no thing as
Luther says can dampne a christian man / save only lack of byleue^ For all
other synnys if believe and faith stand fast / be quyte absorpte and supped up
he says in that faith.

When this man was with such resonyng and myche better than I do or can rehearse
you somewhat sore preced upon / than brought he forth a another gloss and said /
that they meaned not but that faith if yt should suffyse for salvation / must
nedys have with yt charity and good works / or else yt were no very faith /
as a deed man is no very man. How be it he said that though yt be no thing
without good works / yet when yt is joined with good workys / all the meryt
comes of our faith only / and no part thereof for our workys. So that god
gives us heaven for our faith only / and nothing for ou^ workys. For though
he give it not for our faith if we lack good workys / yet if we have both /
he regards not in his reward our workys any thing but only our faith. And
he said that for this cause they say that only faith causes our salvation.

To this yt was answered that if this opynion were true / yet yt well appeared
that this is not the thing that they mean. For the wordys of Luther and
Pomerane and all the archeretyques of that sect be very plain. For they say
yt yt is sacrylege to go about to please god by any good workys but faith
only. And than why should good works be joined to faith / or why should god
exact good workys of us? whereof should they serve / if they be nothing pl^saunt
to god? And when Luther says that nothing can dampne any christian man but only
lack of believe / he shows manyfestely that we not only need no good workys
with our faith / but also that so we have faith / none evil workys can hurt
us. And so he means plainly that faith only with out any good workys joined
thereto / and also with all kind of evil workys joined thereto / is suffycye^t
to save us. And therefore if ye be of his sect (was yt said to the man) ye can
not avoid but that this is your very doctrine how so ever ye color yt.

Than was yt ferther asked him if their meaning should be such as he had said /
what should move him and other his fellows so to think / that in faith and
good workys joined together / the good workys were nothing worth / but that
all the merit should be in the faith / and all the thank and reward should be
given to the faith / and right ^ought to the good workys.

(...) he answered that many textys of scripture enduced them there unto / and
specyal textys of saint Poule / Fides iustificat / faith iustyfyeth. And
Credidu Abraam deo / et reputatu^ est ^i ad iusticiam / Abraam byleued god /
and yt was accounted in him for justice. Si ex operibus / habet quidem gloriam
sed non apud deum / if he were iustyfyed by the workys / tha^ had he glory /
but not with god. Si ex operibus / Cristus pro nobis gratis mortuus est. If we be
iustyfyed by works / tha^ did Christ dye for us for naught. Grates rede^pti
estis / ye be redeemed freely. And thereby may we se that our workys were part
of the cause. And yet specially these wordys of our savior Christ he said much
moved them to be of that mind / where he says Qui crediderit et baptisatus
fuerit saluus erit / He that byleueth and is baptized shall be saved. where
Christ requyryth nothing but only faith.

By all these textys he said y^ plainly appeared that all our salvation came of
faith / as Abraam was iustyfyed by faith and not by his works. And that if
our good workys should be the cause of our salvation / than as saint Poule says
Christ dyed for naught. For he neded not to dye for us / if our own workys might
save us. Nor we were not redeemed freely / if we should redeem our self with the
payement of our own workys.

To this was yt answered that those textys and all other alleged for that
purpose / sygnyfye none other but that after the faith of Christ brought in to
the world by the incarnacyon and passyo^ of our blessed savior / men are no
le^ged bounde^ to the obseruaunce of Moses law. Nor that all the law of Moses
/ nor all the good workys of man / were not able to save one man of them self
/ nor without faith / and y^ Christ freely redeemed us. For neither had he or ever
shall have any reward of us for the bitter pains taken in his blyssed passion
for us. Nor never deserved we unto him that he should so much do for us. Nor
the first faith / nor the prechynge thereof / nor the first iustyfycacyon of
man thereby / nor the sacrament and fruit of our baptysme / was not given to
the world for any good workys that ever the world had wrought / but only of
goddys mere lybetal goodness. But yet there is never a text of them nor any
other in all scripture so me^t / that after the baptysme the faith only shall
save us without good workys / if we live and have reason to do the^. For though
it be said by the mouth of our savior / he that byleueth shall be saved /
where he nothing speaks of any good works / yet means he not that he that
byleueth shall be saved / without good workys if he live to do them. For else
why should ye not as well say that men shall be saved for keeping of the
commau^dementys with out faith / sith Christ says if y^ wyl^e entered in to the
kingdom of heaven keep the commaundementys. And says also / do that and thou
shall have life. At which time he spoke no word of any faith. He says also
in holy scripture / Date clemosina^ et omnia mu^da sunt vobis / Give almoyse /
and all is clean in you. which wordys if men should as largely conster for the
pre^mynence of almoyse deed / as ye th^^ are of Luthers sect constre the
textys that speak of faith / they might take a false gloss and color to say /
that with out faith or penance either / or any other virtue / almoyse deed
alone suffyseth for salvation / how wredehedly so ever we led our life bysyde.
But if we should so say of almoyse deed / we should say wrong / as ye do when
ye say so of faith. For like wise as yt is understand that faith must nedys go
with good workys if they shall be frutfull / though yt be not spoken of in those
te^tes that speak of good workys / so is yt understood that in them which
after baptysme have time and reason to work well / good workys must walk with
faith and sorrow at heart for fawte of good workys / if the faith shall aught
avail them. For if both good works and fynall repentance of the lack of
good works do fail us / having time and reason to them / we be like to fare
myche the worse for our faith. And yt this is thus / we may well know by the
textys of holy scripture if we set them together / and take not one text for
our part and set a another at naught. To this answered he that albe yt these
textys set togeth^r / do prove that faith alone does not suffyse without good
workys (which thing he said that him self denied not) yet he said yt none of
those textys prove any thing the contrary / but that when faith and good workys
be joined together / all y^ merit comes yet of our faith only and nothing of
our workys.

Whereunto he was answered that though it so were in deed that no textes of
scripture proved the contrary / yet sith there is none that says so / and y^
hole church says and byleueth the contrary / what reason have ye to say so /
and to give the hole merit unto faith / and no part of the reward to good
workys? And now have ye myche les^^ reason so to do / when the plain wordys of
holy wryt be openly to the contrary. For did not god say to Cain / If thou do
well thou shalt have well? Says not Christ of theym^ that does almoyse / A
good measure shaken together / heped and runnynge over / shall they give in to
your bosom? Does not our lord show that in the day of judgment he will give
the kingdom of heaven to them that have done almoyse / in mete / drink /
clothe / and lodgyng / bycawse of their charity used in those dedys? which
dedys though he will not reward with heaven except faith went with the^ / yet
if they were wrought in faith / he promyseth to reward those workys and not
their faith only / and that so ferforth that yt appears by the wordys of our
sauyoure in the same placys / and by his wordys which he said he would in the
day of judgment speak to the^ that had by faith wrought wonders in his name
without good workys and cheryte / whom he would tha^ bydde / walk workers of
wickedness / and tell them that he knows them not. By these thyngys I say
yt well appears / that be a ma^nys faith never so great / yet if those good
workys fail him / his faith shall fail of heaven.

Than said he yet again that faith can never be without go^d workys. But and
if a man have faith / his faith shall not fail nor ceace to bring forth the
fruit of good workys / as the tree brings forth his leuys.

Than was yt answered him y^ he (...) (...) was than all the labor and the
pain that thappostles took in prechynge all naught and sinful? all the
tormentys yt the martyrs suffered in their passion all together sin? all ye
dedys of ch^ryte that Christ shall as him self says reward with everlasting
life ^t the g^nerall i^dgement be they syn^ all to gether? Saint Poule rekened
it other wise. For he said boldly of him self / bonu^ certamen certaui /
cursu^ consumm^^i / et nu^c superest michi corona iu^^itie / I have labored
and stryuen a good strife / I have performed my course / now lac^eth me no
more for me but y^ crown of justice.

Thereunto he answered that saint Powle would not say that o^^ dedys were
suff^cyent of them self / but that all our suffycyency^ is of god. Whereunto
yt was answered that this was little to the matter. For no more is our faith
suffycyent of yt self / but the suffycyency thereof is also of god / in that
our lord with our endeuo^r gives us grace to believe / and in that yt ly^eth
our lord of his goodness so hyghly to reward yt. For surely as it is very true
that saint Poule says th^^/Non su^t condign passiones h^i^^ vite ad futuram
gloriam que reuelabitur in no^is / all that ever we can suffer in this world /
is not worthy the glory to come that shall be showed in us (For what thing
cowld a sely wr^ched creature do or suffer for god in the brefe time of this
short life / yt might of right require to be rewarded euerlastyngly / with
such in^^^ym^ble joy as neither ^ye has seen nor tongue can express / nor
heart can ymagyne or conceive) so y^ yt also as true that all the faith we ^^ue
or ca^ have can of his own nature as little or myche less deserve heaven / as
our other good deeds. For what gret^ thing do we to god / or what great thing
could we ask him of right / because we believe hi^? as though he were much
beholde^ unto us / in yt we vouchesaufe to trust him / as though his worship
hunge in our handys / and his estymacyon lost if he were out of credence with us.
And therefore among many folysh wordys of Luther / as folyshe as ever heretyque
spoke / he never sp^^e a more frantyque / tha^ in that he says yt god has
need of our faith. For he says that god has no need of our good workys /
but he has need of our faith / and has need that we should believe him.
Truth is yt that he nedeth^ neither our faith nor our workys. But sith that
he has determined tha^ he will not save us without both if we be of
dyscrecyon to have both / therefore have we need of both. And yet neither is
there the tone nor the tot^er nor they both together between them / that be of
their own nature worthy the reward of heaven. But as we se^ y^ one ounce of
gold whereof.x. pownde weyghte were not of his own nature toward man worth one
ounce of whete / nor one hundred pownde weight thereof of the nature self
worth one sely sheep / is yet among men by a price appointed and agreed worth
many hole sheep / and many a pownde weight of bread / so has yt lyked y^
lyberall goodness of god to set as well our faith as our dedys / which were
else both^ twayn of their own nature right little i^ value at so high a price
/ as non^ is able to bye them and pay for the^ but him self / bycawse we
should work^ th^^ only to him / and have none other pay master nor notte other
chapma^ to sell our ware and our work unto / but only him. Except we would be
so mad and towardys him so unkind yt we would sell yt to a another for less /
nather than to him for more. As some do / that had lever travail far of and
sell for less / than they would for more sell to their neighbors at home. And
as do these folysh ypocrytes / which rather tha^ they would sell their work to
god for everlasting joy of heaven / sell yt all to the world for the peuysh
pleasure of ye vayn praise puffed out of pore mortal mennys mouths with a
blast of wind. Unto this he said that very true yt was yt all our workys took
their value and price after thacceptacyo^ of god / and as he list to allow
them. But he said that god rejected / dysalowed / and set at naught all the
workys of infydelys wrought without faith. For sine fide impossible est
placere deo / without faith yt is i^possyble to please god. S^ o^ his faithful
chosen people that believe and trust in him / he accepts and allows all the
dedys. And that is said he / well proved by the wordys of saint John^ / Nichil
da^nationis est hiis qui sunt in Christo jesus. And albe yt that in the
rehersyng of the co^munycacyo^ had with this man / yt may well be yt my
remembrance may partly mysse the order / partly peradventure add or my^ysh
in some part of the matter / yet in this point I assure you faithfully / there
is no manner chau^g or varyau^ce from his opinion / but that after many shyftys
he brought yt plainly to this point at last / that he and his felows that were
of Luthers sect / were fermely of this opinion / that they byleued that god
works all in every man good workys and badde. How be yt no such as he
foreknoweth to be dampened / no manner workys be profyfable to them. For god
takes them for naught be they never so good. But on the the other side in those
he has chose^ fro ye begynni^g and predestynate to glory / all works be good
ynog^ For god accepts and takes the^ well a worth be they never so bad.

It was asked him than whyther yt the forsakynge of Christ by Peter was allowed
and well approved by Christ. And whyther yt aduour^y and ma^slaugh^ter was by
god well allowed in Dauyd. Whereunto he said that because they were chose^ and
predestynate / therefore those synnys were not / nor the synnys of any such men
be not imputed unto them. But god because he has from the beginning chosen
them to everlasting bliss / therefore he ^rre^teth no blame of their dedys
unto them / but all the workys of a just man that is to say quod he of a
person by god predestynate to glory / turn him to good / how evil so ever
they be. And this for co^clusyon he declared to be their very plain mind and
opinion / for all the clockys that he set upon the matter before / to make yt
seem that they mened in their words none harm. And there yt clearly appeared /
that he and his f^^ which in their prechyng do covertly and craftily sect out
the dampnable sect of Luther / hoope and ga^e always for some other time / in
which they trust openly and boldly to play the ravenous w^luys and devour
the sheep and mar ye hole flok. And i^ yt mean s^as^^ be co^te^t to play ye
wyly foxes and wyrry si^ple souls and pore la^bes / as they may catch the^
strageli^g from ye fold / or rather like a false shepeherdes do^ yt would but
back i^ sight / and some to fetch in ye sheep / and yet kill a lamb in a
corner. Men speak of some that bear two facys in one hode. I never saw any yt
more verily play yt pagau^te / than do this kind of such prech^ ours. For in
prechyng to the people they make a vysage as though they came straight from
heaven to teache them a new better way and more true than the church techeth /
or has taught this many hundred year. And then to ye church in examynacyon
they show the^ self as pore me^ of mydle earth / and as though they taught none
other wise tha^ ye church does. But in co^clusyo^ when they be well examyned /
and with much work that falsehode of their cloked collusyo^ is pulled of / the^
appears there all ye malycyous treachery / and what poison they put forth
under the cloak of honey. As this man yt I tell you of laboring all yt he
might by many means to make yt seem / that in prechi^g / yt faith alon was
sufficient for our saluacyo^ / and yt good works were nothing worth / had
nothing intended but well and according to ye doctrine of ye church / and yt he
and his fellows never meant otherwise tha^ ye church meneth / yet in co^clusyo^
he plainly showed him self / yt he and his felows entend thereby to bring ye
people to this point at last / yt all thing handgeth only upon desteny / and
that the lybertye of ma^nys will should serve of right naught / nor me^nys deeds
good or bad made no dyfference before god / but that in his chosen people
nothing myslyketh him be yt never so bad / and in the the other sort nothing
pleseth him be yt never so good / the very worst and most my scheuouse heresye
yt ever was thought upon / and thereto the most mad. For as yt is said
unto him / if this were true / whereto preche they at all? and counsel any man
o^^ thing or other? What fruit cowlde come of their exhortacyon if all should
hang upon destenye? There were showed unto him many thyngys for the reprofe
of that unreasonable and detestable heresye / and that the textys which he
alleged / nothing made for his purpose. For as for that he alleged of saint
Powle / that there is no dampnacyon to them that be in Christ Jesus / was meant
of good faithful folk that live vertuousely / and therefore where he says
that there is no dampnacyon to them that be in Christ Jesus / yt follows
forthwyth in the text / those that walk not after the ^^esshe. Menyng plainly
yt there is no man so planted in Christ Jesus / but and if he follow ye fleshly
ways of his sensual appetytys / he shall be dampened for all his faith in Christ.
For ellis it should follow upon this false opinion / if god accept well all the
workys of them that are predestynate / than is sin no sin. But in ye the other
sort who^ god has not predestynate. And than is yt as myche to say as no man
may lawfully be naught no man lawfully do theft or aduoutery / nor lawfully be
a manquellour / nor lawfully forswere him self but goddys good sonnys and his
special chosen children.

Now where he alleged the wordys of saint Powle / q just omnia cooperantur in
bonu^ / To a just man all thyngys work together to his well / yt was said
that yt meant that all the euylles that men did unto them / turn them to good
and be to good me^ occasion of their merit / as was to Job all ye torme^tys by
which ye devil assauted his pacyence / and all the paynys that P^gan tyrau^tys
did unto the holy martyrs. And sometime ye syn in which a good man is by goddys
sufferaunce permytted to fall / is an occasyon to him of a gretter good / or of
thauoydyng of a gretter syn. As theschewynge of an high spyrytuall pride / in
to which peradventure the contynuall c^urse of his virtuous life might by the
deuyls subtle suggestyon have brought him / whereas one foul act of lechery
has showed him his f^ayletye / and instead of pride brought him in to
penance and humylyte / and make him run the faster forward in virtue /
bycawse he has let and sit still a while in syn / and therefore will he
run forth to win again in his way that he before cast him self
behind. But yt was not meant that ever their synnys so turned the^ to good /
that they were accepted the more and rewarded the better for their evil dedys.
Nor god remytteth not the synnys of his chosen people / nor forbereth not to
impute the blame thereof unto them / bycawse they be his chosen people. For he
accepts not folk for their persons but for their merytys / but where as they
have sinned / he punyssheth as well them as other / and sometime more because
their formare good living somewhat of congruence deserved that they should by
punysshment be called again to grace / and not be for their fawte so sone cast
clean away / as some other obdurate in maly^e and evil cu^^ume of sin /
deserve to have ye grace of god and his calling ^n never more offered unto them
/ and unto some yt is o^^red that will not receive yt. God called on ^a^yd by ye
prophet Nathan / and yet punysshed his of^^re. Christ looked on Peter after he
had forsaken and forsworn him / and Peter therwyth took repentance. God looked
on Judas and kyssed him to / and he turned to none amendment. Now god from the
beginning before ye world was created / foreseyng in his dyuyne pseyence or
rather in y^ therny^e of his godhed presently byholdyng / that Peter would
repent and Judas would dyspayre / and that the tone would take hold of his grace
the the other would reiecte yt / accepted and chose the tone and not the the other /
as he would have made the contrary choice / if he had forsene in them the
contrary change.

The.xii. chapyter.
The author inueheth against the most pestylent sect of these Lutheranys /
which ascrybe our salvation and da^nacyon and all our dedys to desteny.

BUt now for to say as that heretyque said after all his shyftys at last that
all that shall be saved shall be saved only because that god from ye
beginning has chosen them / and because of that choice all their dedys be
good / or if they be evil yet god for cause of his eternal choice takes the^
well in wurth and imputes no blame unto them / and that all other people whom
god has created shall be dampened only bycawse he would not chose them / and
that all their dedys either be naught or not well accepted / because god list
not in the beginning to chose them / and that he works both in ye tone sort
and in the the other all their deeds him self alone / and they do nothing therein
them self / and so that god whose goodness is i^estymable does dampne so
hounge a number of people to intolerable and intermynable torme^tys only for
his pleasure / and for his own dedys wrought in them only by him self /
this false opinion is as the kyngys hyghnes most vertuo^sly writes in his
epistle to Luther / the most abomynable heresye yt ever was. And surely it is
so far against all holy scripture well understood / so far against all
natural reason / so utterly subuertyng all virtue and all good order in the
world / so hyghly blasphemi^g the goodness and majesty of almighty god in heaven
/ that yt is more than wonder how any man erthely that has either one spark
of wit in his head / or toward god or man one drop of good will in his heart /
should not abhor to here yt. For this execrable heresye makes god the cause
of all evil / and such cruel appetyte as never tyrannte and tormentour had /
ascrybe they to the benygne nature of almighty god. For where as our ^auyour
Christ took upon him self all our syn / and of his endless pytye bare the pain
of them for our sake / this dampnable heresye holds / that god should be
first so untrue that he should lay unto us the wight and blame of his own
fawtys / that is to wit the evil workys which as they say be not wrought by
us but in us by god / and thereunto they make him so dyspy^uouse and cruel /
that for his own deeds so done he should have a perpetual delight and pleasure to
torment us. Now turn they y^ trya^le of holy scripture quyte in to poyso^. For
this false error onys taken for treuth / whereof should all scripture serve?
whereof should serve ye exhortacyo^s to good workis if men neither any do / nor
any can do / neither of the^ self nor with help of grace? or if any be done by
them which be not chosen / their dedys be not accepted of god / because he has
not chose^ their persons / whereof shall serve the prechyngys and exhortacyo^s
to the faith / if the herers have no lyb^rtye of their own will / by which
they may together with goddys grace labor to submytte and subdue the
rebellyon of their reason to the obedyence of faith and credence of the word of
god? whereof shall serve all ye dehortacyons and co^mynacyons and threttys in
scripture / by which god calls men from sin and evil workys / if the world
were onys of mind that they byleued after Luther / that no man does any evil
deed him self / but god does them all him self. And that every man is either
chosen or vnchosen. And if we be of the chosen sort / none evil deed can
dampne us. And if we be of the vnchosen sort / no good deed can avail us. He
that thus byleueth / what cares he what he does / except for the fere of
temporal lawys of this world. And yet if his false faith he strong / he
forces little of them also. For he shall think dyenge in his bed or on the
galows / comes not after his deseruyng but hangethall upon destenye. And
therefore all lawys they set at naught. And they hold that no man is bounden to
obay^ any / but would be at lybertye to believe what they list / and do what they
list / as they say that god does with us not what we deserve but what himself
ly^te.

Whereof shall reason serve if man had no power of him self toward the
dyreccyon of his own workys / but that all our workys were brought forth of us
without our will / worse than the workys be in deed out of a brute best / by
the appetyte of his sensual macyo^ / For ours should be by this opinion
brought forth / as the leaves come out of y^ tree / or as a stone falls
downward / and the smoke upward by the power of nature / so should I say all
our dedys good or bad ascend or descend by the vyolent hand of god magre our
myndys and thus ye bestys be not ashamed to say / wha^ they preue howrly by
their own experyence in them self / that when they will do a thing they do
yt. And when they list they leave yt. I say not by them self alone without
god. But his assystence is always at hand / if we be wyllyng to work therwyth /
As the light is present with ye son / if we list not wylfully to set our eyes
and wynke.

Whereof should serve all lawys? And where were bycome all good order among men /
if every mysordered wretch might allege that his myscheuous deed was he
destyny.

If fre will serve for naught / and every mannys deed is his desteny / why do
these men complayn upon any man? Except they will say they do it because yt is
their desteny to do so? And why will they be angry with them that punysh
heretyques / except they will say bycawse yt is their desteny to be so^ For
if they will hold them to their own sect / and say men do the^ wrong to
burn them for their heresies bycawse yt was their desteny to be heretyques /
they may be then well answered with their own wordys / as one of their sect
was served i^ a good town in Almayne which when he had robbed a man and was
brought before ye judges he could not deny the dedde / but he said yt was his
desteny to do yt and therefore they might not blame hi^ / they answered him
after his own doctrine that if yt were his destenye to stele / and that
therefore they must hold him excused / than yt was also their desteny to hang
him / and therefore he must as well hold them excused again. And undoubtedly
among men these takers away of fre will may never avoid that answer by
reason. But than fall the wretches to the desperate ways of deuyls and dampened
sowlys. Tha^ fall they to raylyng and reprouyng the justice of god and say that
him self he wrought their evil workys / and wrongfully punysshed them / and
cruelly created them to wrechednes. Our mother Eve laid the wight of her sin
to the serpent / and god was offended that she took not her own part to her
self. But these wreches excuse them self and ye devil and all / and lay both
their own fautes and the deuyls to / to the blame of almighty god. But sithe
what so they say / they little care in deed of hell or of heaven / but would in
this world live in lewd lybertye / and have all run to riot. And sith they se
that they can not so be suffered / nor their sect allowed in judgment / they
deuyse by all the ways they can to get so many to fall in to their sort /
that they may be able to turn the world up so down / and defend their folly
and false heresye by force. And this they call the lybertye of the gospel / to
be dyscharged of all order and of al lawys / and do what they list / which be
yt good / be it bad / is as they say nothing but the workys of god wrought in
them. But they hope yt by this mean god shall for the while work in them
many merry pastymes. Wherein if their heresye were onys (...) never bygon with
vyolence / though they had used all the ways they coud to allecte ye people by
prechyng / though they had therwt done as Luther does now / and as Machomete
did before / bring up opynyons pleasant to the people / gyuyng them lybertye
to lewdnes / yet if they had set vyo^^^^ aside / good christian people had
peradventure yet unto this day / used le^^ vyolence toward them than they do
now. And yet were heresye well worthy to be as ^ore as any other f^ut / sith
there is n^ fawt that more ^^^endeth god. How be it while they forbear
vyole^ce / there was little vyole^ce done to them. And ^^^ely though god be
able against all persecucyo^ to pserue and encreace his faith among the people
/ as he did in the beginning for all the persecucyon of the Paynyms and the
Iewys / yet is yt no reason to look that christian pryncys should suffer the
catholyke christian people to be oppressed by Turkys / or by heretyques worse then
Turkys. By my soul quod your friend I would all the world were all agreed to
take all vyolence and compulsyon away upon all sydys christian and hethen / and
that no man were constrained to bylyue but as he could be by grace wysedom and
good wordys enduced / and then he y^ would go to god go on a goddys (...)/and he
that will go to the d^uyll the devil go with him. Forsooth quod I and if yt so
were / yet would I little dowt but y^ the good seed being sowe^ among ye people
/ should as well come up and be as strong to save yt self as y^ ^o^le / and god
should always be stronger then the de^yll. But yet be heretyques and hethen men
in two dyuers^ cases. For in (...) the Turkys (...) and Paynyms would suffer ye
faith of Christ to be pesybly preched among the^ / and that we cryst^n me^
should therefore suffer in like wise all their sectys to be preched among us /
and vyolence taken away by a^^ent on both the sydys / I nothing mystrust that
ye faith of Christ should much more encreace th^^ decay. And albe yt that we
should find among us / that would for the lewd lybertye of these sectys draw to
the devil / yet so should we find I dowt not among them also many a
thousand / that should be content to le^e that bestely pleasure and come to the
faith of Christ / as came in the beginning to crystendom ^^^e of the Paynysmes
/ that lived as volup^uousely as the Tu^kys do (...). But sith vyolence is used
on that p^e^/and Crystys faith not there suffered to be preched and taken / he
y^ would now suffer that sect to be preched or taught among christian men and
not punysh and destroy the doers / were a plain enemy to Christ / as he ye were
content to suffer Christ lose his worship in many so^lys on this side / without
any one w^nne in their s^ede on the the other ^^de. But now if vyolence were
wyth^^^ wen on that side then this way that ye speak of were peradventure
between crystendom and Tu^kaye o^ ^^ganys if the world were a^^ented thereunto
and could hold yt / none ^^yll ways. For sithe we should nothing so myche
regard as the honor of god / and (...) of the cry^^en ^ayth / and wynn^^ge of
mennys souls to heaven / we should (...) to dy^h^nourg^d if we mystrus^ed that
his faith preched among other ^^^^^^e^tly without dy^^urbau^ce should not be

punished by death. w^ll may yt be that as we be all men^^ and not angellys / some
of them may (...) some time either over fer^^^t mind or vndyscre^e zele / or
per^as an ^ngry and a cruel ha^te / by which they may ^^^end god in y^ self
same deed / whereof they should else gretely me^yt. But surely ye order of the
spyrytuall law therein is does good / reasonable / (...)/and charytabl^/and
nothing desyryng ye death of any man therein. For (...) ye first fawte he is
(...) forswereth all heresies / does such ^enau^ce for his fawte as ye
bishop assygneth him. And is in such wise gracyously received ag^yne in to
the favor and suffragis of Cristes church. But and if he be taken ^ftesonys
with the ^^me crime again / than is he put out of ye christen ^^okke by
exco^m^nycatio^. And by cause that being such / his conuersacyon were pe^ylou^e
among christen men / the chrych refuses him / and thereof the clergy gives
^nowledge to the te^poral^y^/no^ exha^tyng ye prync^ or any man ^llys either to
kill him or punysh him / but only in the pr^sence of the temporal offycer / ye
spyrytu^lty^ not delyuereth him but leueth him to the secular hand / and
forsakes him as one exco^munycate and removed ou^ of the chryste^ ^^okke. And
though ye church be not light and sudden in re^eyuyng him agayn^/yet at ye
time of his death upon his request with tokens of ^^^^ta^^ce / he is absolved and
received again.

The.xiiii. chapyter.
The author su^ what shows that the clergy does no wrong in leuyng
heretyques to secular hand / though their death follow thereon. And he shows
also tha^t yt is lawful to resyste the (...) and (...) other infydelys / and
that pryncys b^ ^^^^^den thereto.

MAry quod your friend bu^ (...) m^ thyn^eth the bishop does (...) much as
though he kylle^^ him / when he leueth him to ye secular hand in such ty^e and
plac^/as he w^^eth w^l he sh^l s^n^ be burned.

I will not here enter in to the ^^e^^yon quod I whyther a priest myg^^ for any
cause / and if for any / whyt^^^ th^^ for heresye without blame of y^^
re^^la^yte put or command any man to death / either by express wordys or
under the general name of right and i^^^yce. In which matter I could no^ ^ack
both reason authoryte and exempl^ of holy men. But in this matter that we have
in hand / yt is suffycyent that the bishop neither does yt nor com^^^^deth
yt. For I think there will n^ ^eason bear yt / that when the heretic if he
went abroad would with ye spredynge of his error infecte other folk / the
bishop should have such pytye upon him / that he should rather th^n other men
should punysh his body / suf^^^ him to kill other mennys sowlys. In deed quod I
there be some as ye say that either of high pretended pytye or of a feigned
obseruaunce of the counsel of Christ / would that no man should punyshe any
heretyque or infydele either / not though they invaded us and did v^ all ye
harm they possible could. And in this opinion is Luther and (...) folowers /
which among their other heresies hold for a plain concl^syon / yt yt is not
lyefull to any christian m^n to fight against the Turk / or to make against him
any resyste^ce / though he come in to crystendom with a great (...) to de^^roy
all. For they say that all cryste^ men are bounden to the cou^sayles of Christ /
by which they say that we be forboden to defend our self / and that saint
peter was as ye rehearsed reproved of our savior wha^ he struck of M^lchus ere
/ albe it yt he did yt in the defense of his own master / and the most
innocent man that ever was. And unto this they lay as ye said in y^ beginning /
that sith the time y^ christian men first fell to fighting / yt has ne^^r
encreaced but always mynysshed and decayed. So that at this day the Turk has
estrayted us very nere / and brought yt in within a right narrow compare / and
narrower shall do say they / as long as we go about to defend crystendo^ by
the sword. which they say should be as yt was in the beginning encreaced / so
be continued and preserved only by pacyence and martyrdom. Thus holyly speak
these godly fathers of Luthers sect / labourynge to procu^e y^ no man should
wyth^tand y^ Turk / but let him win all. And wha^ if should come to y^/tha^
would they as yt (...) win all agay^ by their pacye^te / high (...)/and (...)/by
which now they can not suffer to besy^^^ ^^^yr b^^^e^y voluptu^^^nesse / but
bro^^ their bows / and take the^ har^^ttys under the name of wy^ys. And where
they may not fight agayn^^ the Turk ^^yse up i^ great pla^^^ to ^yghe against
their eue^ cryste^. It is I trow no great maystry to perceive who^ they labou^^
to please y^ have y^ (...). And if y^ Turk happen to (...) dout whose (...)
they will (...) and y^ christian people ^elyke (...) none so (...) to rise up in
rowtys and fight agai^t cr^ste^ me^ / and destroy as y^ sect has done many a
good relygyous house / spoiled / meyhemed / and slain many a good virtuous man
/ robbed / polluted / and pulled down many a goodly church of Christ.

And now where they lay for a proof / y^ god were not co^te^ted with batayl made
against infydeles / y^ loss and mynyshme^t of cryste^do^ sins ye guyse byga^
/ they fare as did onys an old sage father fool in Kent at such time as diverse

n^w the see excluded thense / for lack^ of such course and scouryng is chouked
(...) with s^nde / as they thus alleged diverse men diverse causes / there

chote well yt has. For by god I knew yt a good haven till ye steple was
bylded. And by ye Mary mass cha marked yt well yt never thr^ue synnys. And
thus wisely sp^ke these holy Luthera^ys / which sowing scysmes and sedycyo^s
among christian people / lay the los^e there o^ to the wythstandyng of the Turks
inuasyon / and the resystynge of his malice / where they should rather if they
had any reason in their heddys / lay yt to the contrary. For when cryste^
pryncys did their deuoyre against myscreast^is and infydelys / there be stories
and monumentys enough that wytnes^e the manifest aid and help of god in
great vyctoryes given to good christian pryncis by his almighty hand. But on the
the other side synnys that thambicio^ o^ christian rulers desyryng each others
d^mynyon / have set them at (...)/and dedly dyssenssyon among the^ self /
whereby while each has aspyred to then^^^neynge of his own / they have ^ytell

to swalowe the^ all.

and ^lbe yt Cry^^ forb^de saint Peter being a priest / and under himself
prince of his prestys to fight with ye temporal sword / toward thempechement
and resystence of his fruteful passion / wheruppo^ depe^ded ye saluacyo^ of
mankind / which affection our savior had before that time so sore reproved
and rebuked in him / that he called him therefore Satan / yet is yt nothing to
ye purpose to allege / y^ by y^ ensample te^perall princes should without the let
of such spyrytuall profit and the suffrau^ce of much spyrytuall harm suffer
their people to be invaded and oppressed by infydelys / to their utter undoing
not only temporal but also of a great part perpetual / which were like of
their frayletye for fere of wordely grefe and inco^modyte / to fall from ye
faith and renye their baptysme. In which p^rell sith our lord would not y^ any
man should wylfully put him self / and for y^ cause aduysed his dyscyples y^ if
they were pursued in one city / they should not cu^forth and f^leh^rdely put

/ but ^^ther (...) thens in to some other place where they might serve him in
quyete / till he should suffer the^ to fall in such point y^ th^r^ were no way
to escape / and th^^ would he have the^ abide by their takeli^g like mighty
champyons / wherein they shall not in such case fail of his helpe^ Now all be
yt so that Christ and his holy app^stles / exhort every man to pacyent^ and
sufferaunce / without requytynge of an evil deed or making any defen^^/but
using ferther sufferau^ce / and (...) also good for evil / yet (...) does
this cou^sayll (...) man y^ he shall of (...) y^ comen nature / suffer a another

case both nature / reason / and goddys byheste byndeth / first ye pryncys to ye
saufegarde of his people with ye parell of him self / as he taught Moses to
know him self bounden to kill ye Egypcyans in ye defense of Hebrew / and after
he byndeth every man to ye help and defense of his good and harmles
neyghbour^agai^st ye malice and crueltye of ye wrong doer. For as ye holy
scripture says / vnicuique dedit deus cura^ de prorimo suo / god has given
every man charge of his neighbor to keep hi^ from harm of body and soul / as
much as may lie in his power. And by this reason is not only excusable but also
co^me^dable / y^ come^ war which every people ta^eth in ye defense of their
cu^tre against ^myes yt would i^uade it / sith yt every man fyghteth not for ye
defense of him self of a puate affection to him self / but of a cryste^ charity

The.xv. chapyter.
That pryncys be bounden to punyshe heretyques / and that fair handelyng
helps little with many of them.

HAd surely as the pri^cys be bounden yt they shall not suffer their people by
infydelys to be invaded / so be they as depely bounden that they shall not
suffer their people to be seduced and corrupted by heretyques / sith ye parell
shall in short while grow to as great both with mennys sowles wythdrawen from
god / and their goodys lost / and their bodies destroyed by come^ sedycyon /
insurreccion / and open war / within the bowellys of their own land. All
which may in the beginning be right ^asely avoided / by punishment of those
few that be ye first. which few well repressed / or if need so require
utterly pulled up / there shall fa^^^ the fewer have list to follow. For if
they were handled in a contrary manner / and as ye seemed to mean in the
beginning of our matter / in s^ede of punyshme^t / ent^eted / favored / and by
fair wordys and rewardys brought home agayns / I fere me then that ye should
find ly^^ll f^^yte in that fas^yon. For fy^^^ where as they fall in to heresy^
by pryd^/that way would make them pro^^der / and set ye more by the^ self. And
(...) would many mo fall thereto / of purpo^^ (...) again (...). So yt a^
ma^molukes and genysaryes about ye tur^e a^^ sowdeyn have used (...) cryste^
their (...) their faith after / they might be made man molukes or genysaryes as
their fathers were / and may be had in ye more estymacyo^ and favor about the
great turk / even like wise within a while if we take that way with heretyques
we shall have young fresh fellows first bycome heretyques / that they may be
prayed and hired after to com to Crystys faith again. I would not they were
over hastily handled / but little rygour and myche mercy showed where symplenes
appeared and not high heart or malice. For of such as be proud and malycyouse /
myche proof has been made all ready. For of some sort many full fair handled
/ little change them self or come to good amendment. I told you my self
and very true yt was of twain that were detected of heresye unto the most
honorable prela^e of this realm / and in what benygne fatherly manner and
lyberall also he dealt with them. And yet what amendment made his gentle and
courteyse intretye / in their stoburne stomach? were they not after worse then
they were before? and so used themself that after myche harm done by them /
the came in short space after to their open co^uyccyon? They be ye wo^e well at
ye first custumably received to grace / and verily that for such merytys /
forgyuenes is reward enough. And if they can not by that warnyng be war^ed /
surely as saint Powle says he is not to be trusted often / but rather of all
good christian people to be eschewed and avoided from the flokke. For they be so
f^^ waxe^ crooked / that seld^me can they be ^yghted again.

Forsooth quod your friend yet as I said at my first (...) to you / (...) I
worthy to be of counsayll with the clergy when there were a man founden fawtye
therein / whom the people have in good estymacion for some great opinion of
learning and virtue / they should be secretly and soberly monysshed / and not
the matter publyshed among ye people. And finally if they so should nedys be
openly conuented and corrected in face of the world / th^n would I not yet have
the^ called Lutheranys / lest y^ people which had good opinion of the^ / or if
they happen to perceive them for naught and so take them / tha^ shall they
peradventure give the less credence to all good men / and set the less by all
good precheours after.

Surely quod I certain rule that were always best / were hard to give in such
case. Sometime there may peradventure such honestye be joined with such
repentance / that yt would not be myche a mysse to preserve the mannys
estymacion among the people / to whom his perfayts chaung, may per^as more than
recompense his for more error and ouersyght. But where as the contrary shall
seem conuenyent / there can I not se^ why we should forbere to tall them
Lutheranys / sith yt is both an old usage to call heretyques after the name of
him who^ they follow in their heresye / and also as Luthers sect is in effect
the hole hepe of all heresies gathered together / yt is now all one to call
him ^ Lutherans or to call him a^ heretyque / those (...) being in (...)
equyualent Luther techyng all must nothing but heresies / nor (...) name of
Lutheranys should be custumably brought in me^nys erys as adyou^e as the name of
heretyques. Nor I se not so great fere that ryther folk shall for opinion of
any mannys virtue in whom they se them self deceived / wtdrawe their favor
and affection from such as are good in deed / or fall in to ye favor of
Luthers sect for thestymacyon of the man whom they now se pre^ed naught. For
this will no man do but such as either be so folyshe yt they would hate all
Crystys appostles for ye falshede of Judas / or so noughty that thy would feign
have all the world fall to the same sect and be of their own s^yt.

The.xvi. chapyter.
Of simple unlearned folk yt are deceyuyd by the great good opynyo^ that they
have per^as in the lerning and living of some that teache them errors.

FOrsothe quod your friend yet would there me thinks ^e mich pytye used in
those matters among. For many a man unlearned when he hereth one that he takes
for cunnyng / and freth such a man as he takes for virtuous / commend Luthers
way / he is of symplenes and good mind moved to follow ye same. Surely quod I
therein I say not nay but that these thyngys being such / great pytye yt is to
se many good simple sowlys deceived and led out of the tyght way by the
authoryte of such as they reken for good men and c^nnyng / whom they have
either by open sermons or secret co^munycacyon perceived (...) favorers of
that ungracious se^^/thynkyng that men of such c^nnyng and knowledge in
(...)/being therwyth of (...) be^hauour as they (...) to that way / but if
they knew^ yt for good. And surely where it so happens that any simple soul
is by the good opinion that he has in his master led out of the right bylyef
of ye faith / wenynyg yt were ye very faith which he sees his master who^ he
rekeneth good and cu^nynge follow and lene unto / yt is a very pyttous thing.
And as ye person is less in blame and more easily cured / so is that master
double dampened / as the cause both of his own syn and his ye follows him /
and very hard is he to mend. How be yt sometime we deserve with our sin that
god for ye punyshme^t thereof / suffers us to have lewd leders and evil
techers. And surely for the more part such as be led out of ye right way / do
rather fall there to of a lewd lyghtenesse of their own mind / then for any
great thing that moves them in their master that techeth them. For we se
them as ready to believe a purser a glouer or a weuer that nothing can do but
scantely read englysh / as well as they would believe the wysest and the best
learned doctor in a realm. How be yt be a man never so well learned / and seem
he never so virtuous / yet can we with no reason excuse our self / if we leave
ye right believe for ye trust that we have in any man erthely. For our believe is
taught us by god surely planted in the church of Christ / and thartycles thereof
not new byg^^/but now continued many an hundred y^^e in the great congregacyo^
of christian people / as thyngys certain / sure / and stable / and out of all
questyon / (...) n^ne heretyque does or can deny / and in the hartys of this
congregacyon (...) they written by ye holy hand (...) ^s he that through his
trust put in any man / byleueueth the contrary of any point yt the church of
Christ is taught to believe by god.

This faith was taught by Christ / preched by his apostles / of this wrote his
euangely^^es / and many mo thing were taught tha^ are written. And this faith
should have been taught and fermely standen / all though nothing had been written.
And the artycles of this faith had in me^nis hartys / be the just and sure
rulys of construccyon by which we constre and understand the holy scripture yt
is wryte^. For very sure are we yt who so would constre any text of holy
scripture / in such wise as he would make yt seem contrary to any point of
this catholyke faith which god has taught his church / he gives the scripture
a wrong sentence / and thereby techeth a wrong believe. And as saint Poule says
cursed be he and though he were an angel of heaven. And therefore be we not
excusable if we believe any man to the contrary of ye faith / how good or how
cunning so ever he seem / while we se yt he techeth us a wrong way which we may
sone know if we be good cryste^ and know the bylyef all ready.

And we may have also a great guess thereat / if he teache us secretly as a
pryuy mystery / the doctrine that he would not were vtteryd and showed openly.
For such thyngys be they commonly yt these herety^u^s teache in ^uc^er mur^er /
against ye faith yt all the church byleueth. Now (...) I give this counsel to
every unlearned man / wha^ any man so techeth the whom thou ^a^^ in great
^^^im^cio^ for virtue or cunning / th^^ consider i^ thy self yt he neither has
more (...)/tha^ had saint Austayn / saint Hierome / saint Ambrose / saint
Gregory / saint Cypryan / saint Chrisosteme / with many old fathers and holy
doctors which byleued all their days and dyed in ye bylyefe that thou
byleuest all ready / whereof he techeth the contrary. And so say boldly to him
than if he would begyle the. And say yt those holy doctors byleued not as thou
do / but as he says bring him to ye reckoning before some other good and well
learned men. And I dare be bold to warraunt yt thou shall find him dowble
false. For neither shalt thou find it true yt he told the / and bysydes yt he
shall not let to bylye the / sayng and sweri^g to yt thou say wrong on him /
and that he never told the so.

Mary sir q your fre^d he will happily say yt he were peradventure in ye point
to be pa^doned / bycawse of ye ieopardy yt he might fall in to by ye
mayntenau^ce of his ^pynyo^. Pardon him if yt will q I. But yet is he not than
so good as were those good fathers. For either is his way naught / and tha^
does he naught to teache yt / or if he be good / than is he naught / that for
any fere forsakes yt. For he yt forsakes any troth of Crystes faith /
forsakes Christ. And tha^ says our s^uyour that who so does / shall be
forsaken of him. And he that so does is not to be byleued like those holy
fathers / which have taught us fat ye ^rrary. For they did abide by ye right
faith that they taught / which is as by their bokys appears / the self same
faith yt thou byleuest. And so ferforth abydde they thereby / that diverse of
them sustained great persecucyon therefore / and some of them death and
martyrdom. So that we were more th^^ mad if we had (...) send our sowlys to
ye sowlys of those holy fathers / of whose cu^nyng virtue / and salvation / we
be sure / tha^ to cast them away with these folk / which how holy so ever
they seem / yet show the^ self naught / in yt they teache ye contrary of such
thyngis as those undoubted holy doctors taught.

I marvel the^ quod your friend why they live so virtuously / fasting and
gyuynge their good in almoyse / with other virtuous exercise / both in
forberynge the pleasure of the world / and also taking pain in their
bodies. To this matter quod I our fauyoure him self answers where he says in
the gospel of Matthew / Attendite a falsis prophetis qui veniunt ad vos in
vestimentis ouium / intrinsecus a^tem sunt lupi rapaces. Beware of the false
prophetys that come to you in the clothing of sheep / and yet wythinforth ben
rauenouse wolves. For sith yt they by false doctrine labor to devour and
destroy me^ soulys / we be sure enough that wolves they be in deed / how
^hepyshely so ever they look. And ypocrytys must they nedys be / sith they be
so denounced by goddys own mouth. And well may we perceive that he meneth not
well / wha^ he techeth evil. And that evil he techeth we may well wit / wha^
we se him teache ye contrary of ye which god has all ready taught his hole
church. In which has be^ so many holy fathers so many cunning doctors and so
many blessed martyrs / yt so have bydde^ by ye faith to y^ death / y^ yt were
a ^^enesye / if we would n^w against so many such believe any false heretyque and
faynynge ypocryte / techynge us the contrary. Of those holy fathers of our
faith whom their bokys shows to have byleued us we believe / we have seen and
known their virtuous life well proved by their blyssed end / in which our
lord has testyfyed by many a miracle / yt their faith and their lyuys has
lyked him. But now have we yet seen any such thing by any of these heretyques.
Nor yet so myche as any const^unce in their doctrine / but and if they were
onys found out and examyned / we se them always first ready to lie and forswere
the^ self if ye will serve And wha^ that will not help but their falsed and
perjury proved in their facys / than ready be they to abjure and forsake it /
as long as that may save their lyuys. Nor never yet found I any one / but he
would onys abjure though he never intended to k^pe his oath. So holy would he be
and so wise therewith / that he would with perjury kill his soul for ever / to
save his body for a whyle^ For comenly sone after such as so do / show them
self again / god of his ryghtuousnes not suffryng y^ their falls forswering
should stand the^ long instead.

The.xvii. chapyter.
The author shows y^ some which be Lutheranys and seem to live holyly / and
therefore be byleued and had in estymacyon / entende a ferther purpose them they
pretend / which they will well show if they may onys find their time.

ANd as for their living / the good appearance whereof is the thing that most
blyndeth us / as much suretye as we have of the godly life of our old holy
fathers / whereof y^ world has written / and god h^th borne wytnes by many great
miracles showed for their sakes / as uncertain be we of these men / with whom
we neither he always pre^ent / and (...) also can tell what abomynacyo^s they
may do to su^ of the^ secretly. Nor yet ca^ know their intent and purpose that
they appoint upon and ye cause for which they be for the while content to take
all the pain.

Uery certain is yt ye pride is one cause wherefore they take the pain. For
p^yde is as saint Austeyn says / ye very mother of all heresies. For of an
high mind to be in ye lyki^g of ye people / ^ has cu^myn in to many men so mad
a mind and so frantyque / yt they have not rought what pain they took without
any other recompense or reward / but only ye fond pleasure and delight yt the^
self co^ceyue in their heart / wha^ they think what worship ye people talks
of them. And they be ye deuyls martyrs / taki^g myche pain for his pleasure /
and his very a pys / who^ he makes to tu^ble through ye hope of ye holiness yt
puts the^ to pain with out fruit. And yet ofte^tymes makes the^ mys^e of ye
vayn praise whereof only they be so proud. For while they delight to think how
they be take for holy / they be many tymys well perceived and taken for
ypocrytys as they be.

But such is this cursed affeccyo^ of pride / and so deep sets in ye clawys
where yt catches / ye hard yt is to pull the^ out. This pride has ere this
made su^ learned me^ to deuyse new fantysyes in our faith / because they would
be syn^ular among the people / as did Irrius Faustus Pelagyan and diverse other
old heretyques whose false opynyo^s have ^en long time passed openly condemned
by many holy synodes and general cou^sayles / ^ now god be thanked not only
their opynyons quenched / but also all their books clean gone and vanyshed quye
away / ere ever any law was made for such bokys burni^g. So yt yt well appears
to have be^ ye only work of god yt has destroyed those workys / whyc^e
wrought in their tymys myche harm in his church. This affeccyo^ of pride has

The.xviii. chapyter.
The author shows yt in ye co^demnacyo^ of herety^es / ye clergy might
lawfully do mich more sharply tha^ they do / and yt i^ deed ye clergy does now
no more against heretykes / the^ yt ap^stel co^saileth / and ye old holy
doctors did

FOr as for ye clergy who^ they la^our to bring i^ hatred under ye falls
accusacyo^ of trueltye / do no more therein tha^ saint Austyn / saint Hierom and
other holy fathers have be^ wo^ to do before / nor no fe^ther tha^ thapostle
aduyseth him self. For they do no more but wha^ one heretyque after warni^g
will not (...) ^^t wa^eth wors / eschew hi^ tha^ and avoid hi^ out of Cristes
(...). which is ye very thing yt saint Poule cou^say^eth where he writes to
Cy^us / here^^cu^ h^ mi^e^ post prima^ and sc^^a I correptione^ deuit^. And
this is much less yt ye clergy does to heretykes / tha^ saint peter did unto
Ananias and Saphyra for a far smal^ler matter / yt is to wit for their untrue
sayng and kepi^g aside a portion of their own money / wha^ they made se^blau^ce
as though they brought to thapostle all togeder. For though they were not killed
by his own hand / yet appe^eth it well ye god aylled the^ both twayn by saint
Peter his means as governor of his church / to y^ ^erful ex^aple of al such
as would after y^ break their promise and vow to god wylli^gly made of the^ self
or their own good. which thing luther and tyndal would have al me^ do now. Did
not saint poule write unto ye corynthyes / yt the^ should deliver to ye devil
him yt had defoyl^d his fathers wife / to ye punysheme^t of his body that ye
spirit might be saved in the day of judgment? what say we of Hymynius and
Alexander / of whom (...) to the coryn^^yes also ^^^yneum and Alexandrum
tradid^ sath^^^/vt discant no^ blasphemare. I have quod he bytaken Hymyne^^ and
Alexander to the devil / to ^eche them to leave their blasphemy. In which
wordys we may well learn / that saint Poule as apostle and spyrytuall
gouernouce in that cuntre fyndyng them ^wayn fallen from the faith of christ
in to the blasphemy of that they were bounden to worship / did cause the
devil to turment and punyshe their bodies / which every man may well wit was
no small pain / and peradventure noth without death also. For we find no thing
of their amendment. And this bodyly punysheme^t did saint Poule as yt appears
upon heretics / so that if the clergy did un to myche more blasphemouse
heretyques than I ween they twain were / myche more sorrow than saint Poule
did to them / they should neither do yt without good cause nor without great
authoryte / and euydent example of christ's blyssed apostles. And surely wha^
our savior himself calls such heretics woluys ^lo^ed in shepys skynnys /
and would yt his shepeherdys the governors of his ^lokke should in such wise
avoid them as very shepeherd is would avoid very woluys / there is little dowte
but as an honorable prelate of this realm in his most erudyte book answerith
unto Luther / the prelates christ's church rather ought te^porally to destroy
those ra^^^ouse wolves / tha^ suffer the^ to wyr^te and deuou^e euerlastyngly
the ^okke that Christ has co^myt^ed un to their cur^/and the ^lokke that him
self dyed for to save yt from the woluys mouth. But now though yt well appear
as me thinks yt does that ye clergy might in this case right sore procure
against (...) there than the old holy fathers did in their (...) and the
blessed apostle cou^sayleth them to do. But all the sore punyshement of
heretyques wherwyth such folk as favor them would feign dy^^ame the clergy /
is and has be^^ for the great vtrages and temporal harms that such
heretics have been always ^^nt to do / and sedycyous commocyons yt they be
wont to make / vpsyde the far passing spyrytuall hurty^ yt they do to me^nys
sowlys / devised and executed against the^ of necessyte by good christian pryncys
and polytyque rulers of ye temporaltie / for as much as their wysdomes well
perceived yt ye people should not fail to fall in to many sore and intolerable
troubles / if such sedi^i^us sects of heretyques were not by grievous
punishment repressed in the begynny^g / and ye sparkle well quenched ^re yt
were suffered to grow to over great a fire.

Forsooth quod your friend yt appears well yt the clergy is not in this matter
to be blamed as many men reken. For yt seems that the sore punishment of
heretyques is devised not by the clergy / but by temporal pryncys and good
lay people / and not without great cause Well quod I and to thente^t yt ye shall
perceive (...) much ye better / and over ye believe your (...) ^yen and not my
wordys in many things yt ye have herd of my mouth^ we will not part this
night but I shall deliver in to your hands here m^ bokys tha^ ye will read
over till to mo^ow. But for that ye shall neither need to read all / nor lose
time in sekyng for that ye should se / I have laid you y^ placys ready with
ryshes between the le^ys / and notes marked in the mergentes / where the matter
is towched. So ^^used I to be borne in to his chamber a book of (...)/and
^ertayn workys (...) and some other holy d^ct^^^ ^herwith all a work or twain
of Luther and as many of Tyndall. And in this wise went we to souper / and ^n
the morrow forbear I to speak with him till nere dinner time. At which ^ure
metynge / he showed me yt in the (...) where the ry^his lay / namely in caus^
xxii. questione quint^/and dy^^^^ ^^her of the questyons c^nseque^tly (...)/he
had seen at full that ye clergy d^the at this day no ferther for the
p^nyshment of heretyques / than did the old fathers and holy doctors and
sayntis in time passed^ as by their own wordys there alleged does open and
pl^yn^^ pere. And that as well the clergy in ye persecucio^ of heretyques
lawfully may do / as the temporal pryncys in war ag^ynst infydelys be depely
(...) to do / much more than they (...) do / or of long time have done / or
yet as it seems go about to d^. And ^uer this he said yt he had seen of
Luthers own wordys worse than he had ever h^rd rehearsed / and in Tyndall worse
yet in many thyngys tha^ he saw in Luther him self. And in Tyndals book of
obedye^s he said yt he had sounden what thing Tyndall says against miracles
and against the prayenge to sayntys.

Mary q I and these two matters made us two much bysynes before your ^^yng to ye
vniuersyte. I would it h^d happed you and me to have red over that book of his
before. how be yt in good faith if ye well / we shall yet peruse ^^^r hi^ r^sons
in those poyntys / and consider what weight is in the^. Nay by my tr^uth quod
your friend we shall need now to lose no time therein. For as ^^r miracles / he
says nothing in effect but that which I laid against them before / yt the
miracles were the (...) of the devil. (...) I said yt yt might peradventure
be said so h^ s^yth that in d^de yt is so / aproueth y^ yet less the^ I did.
And therefore as for that (...) of his without better proof is of little weight.
Forsooth quod I Tyndals word alone ascrybyng all the miracles to the devil /
o^ght not to wey much among (...) against the writing of holy saint Austeyn /
saint ^i^^^m^/saint Ambrose / saint Chrysosto^e / saint Gregory / and many ^n
other holy dyctour / writing many a great miracle don at holy pylgrym^gys and
sayntys relyques / done in wo^^^ prese^^e of many substauncyal folk / and
diverse done in their own sight. All which miracles all those blessed sayntys
do ascrybe unto the work of god / and to ye h^nour of those holy sainti^ that
were worshypped at those pylgrym^gis. Against all whom when Tynd^ll ascryb^th
them all to the d^uyll / he plainly shows him self as faithful as he would
seem / very nere syh^^ to t^infydelyte of those Jews yt ascrybed Crystes
miracles to the devil / s^yng yt he did cast out deuyls by the ^^wer of
Bealsabu^ prynee of deuylys. Surely quod your friend and as for that he
reasons against praynge to sayntys is very bare. It must nedys q I be bare /
except he well avoid ye miracles. Whereto when he has nothing to say but to
ascrybe goddys works to ye devil / he shows him self dreuyn to a n^row
strayte. For he and his fellows (...) as touching miracles / neither have god
wyllyng / nor ye devil able / to show any for ye proof of their part / no^ I
trust in god never they shall.

In faith quod your friend as for res^^ing the matter of prayng to saints / he
y^ not worth the redyng^ now. For all the substance in (...) yt is (...)

That is quod I no marvel for he has not herd it. In faith q^^d your ^^end
and of his own making he lays arguments for yt such as he ly^^ (...) he
lays forth fay^^ly / and tha^ does answer them so slenderly / and all his
^^le matter in those poyntys and other so plainly con^utyd by the old holy
fathers / yt yt I had seen so myche before / yt had been lykely to have shorted
myche part of our long co^municacion. For by my troth q he wha^ I consider
both ye partys well / and read Luthers wu^des and Tyndals in some pla^es where
y^ laid me the ryshes / I can not but wonder yt either any almayne could I
ly^e ^^e tone / or ^^y english man ye the other. I can not myche marvel quod I
^^ough many like them well. For sych there is no (...) where in there ^^^^eth
ple^tye of such as be naught / what wonder is if that vycyouse folk ^all to
the favor of their like? And then as for such when their hartys are onys
fyxed upon their blind a^^eccyons / a man may with as myche fruit prech to a
post / as reason with them to the contrary. For they no thing po^der what is
resonably spoken to them ^u^ whereto their (...)cyo^ inclyn^^^ that thing they
(...) to and the other believe / or at the le^^e wise ye way they walk and ^^y
they byl^^e yt. For in good faith that they so believe in d^de / their ^aters be
so mad yt I believe yt not. And yet make they se^blauns as though they byleued
that no man were able to confu^e Luther or Tyndall / where me thinks for
these mathers of their heresies that they so set forth if the ^^dyenes were
indyfferent / there were not in this world a man more mete to (...) Colyns
alone / if (...) la^^^th owte scryptu^e ^o ^^deleem (...) fast as they both^
And in good fayt ^e they both expow^e yt as maddely as he. And so help me god
as me thi^keth yt man is as mad as any of all th^^/which when he sees the
right faith of Christ ^^nty^ued in his ^^tholy^ue church so many hundred y^^s
and on that side so many gloryouse martyrs / so many blessed confessors / so
many godly vyrgynes / and in all that time virtue had in honor / fasting /
prayer / and (...) had in price / god and his sayntys worshypped / his
sacrament is had in reverence / chryste^ soul is tenderly (...) for / holy
vows kept and observed / vyrgynyte preched and praised / pylgrim^ges devoutly
vysyted / every kind of good works commended / And sees now (...) start up
^ new sect setting for the ^^ne ye contrary / destroyng ^hrystes holy
sacramentys / pulling down christ's cross / blasphemyng his blessed sayntys
/ destroyng^ (...) deuocyo^ / (...) to pray for their fathers (...) fasting
days / setting (...) thought the holy ^^yes / pulling down the chyrchys /
^aylynge against the mass / vylanousely demeny^gth^ blessed sacrement of ye
awter the sacred body of our savior Christ / ^ And sees the tone side and the
contynuau^ce thereof so clearly proved by many a thowsande miracle / so clearly
testyfyed by ye virtuous and erudyte books of all the (...) de holy doctors
from the appostles time to our days / and sees on the ^othe^syde a fond
friar and his fellows without wit or grace ^ere us in hand that all those
holy fathers never understood ye scripture / but only these be^^ys that teache
us vice as fast as ever the the other taught us virtue / and ye sees on the tone
side saint Cypryane / Syn^ Hyerome / saint Ambrose / saint (...) may be
party^ers of ye heavenly bless / which the blood of goddys own son has
bought us unto. And this prayer q I serving us for grace / let us now ^yt
