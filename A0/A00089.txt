LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1640.

CHARLES, By the grace of GOD, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc. To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.

Whereas our Bishops, Deanes of Our Cathedral Churches, Archdeacons, Chapters
and Colleges, and the other Clergy of every Diocese within the several
Provinces of Canterbury and York, being respectively summoned and called by
virtue of our several Writs to the most Reverend Father in God, Our right
trusty, and right welbeloved Counceller, William, by divine providence, Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, and Metropolitan, And to
the most Reverend Father in God, Our right trusty and welbeloved Counceller:
Richard, by divine providence, Lord Archbishop of York, Primate and
Metropolitan of England respectively directed, bearing date the twentieth day
of February, in the fifteenth year of Our reign, to appear before the said
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury in Our Cathedral Church of S. Paul in London,
And before the said Lord Archbishop of York, in the Metropolitan Church of S.
Peter in York the fourteenth day of April then next ensuing, or elsewhere, as
they respectively should think it most convenient^ to treat, consent and
conclude, upon certain difficult and urgent affairs contained in the said
Writs; Did thereupon at the time appointed, and within the Cathedral Church of
S. Paul, and the Metropolitan Church of S. Peter aforesaid, assemble themselves
respectively together, and appear in several Convocations for that purpose,
according to the said several Writs, before the said Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, and the said Lord Archbishop of York respectively. And forasmuch
as We are given to understand, that many of Our subjects being misled against
the Rites and Ceremonies now used in the Church of England, have lately taken
offense at the same, upon an unjust supposall, that they are not only contrary
to Our laws, but also introductive unto Popish superstitions, whereas it well
appears unto Us upon mature consideration, that the said Rites and Ceremonies
which are now so much quarrelled at, were not only approved of, and used by
those learned and godly Divines, to whom at the time of Reformation under King
Edward the sixth, the compiling of the Book of Common Prayer was committed
diverse of which suffered Martyrdom in Queen Mary's days) but also again taken
up by this whole Church under Queen Elizabeth, and so duly and ordinarily
practiced for a great part of her Reign (within the memory of diverse yet
living) as that it could not then be imagined that there would need any Rule or
Law for the observation of the same, or that they could be thought to savor of
Popery.

And albeit since those times, for want of an express Rule therein, and by
subtle practices, the said Rites and Ceremonies began to fall into disuse, and
in place thereof, other foreign and unfitting usages by little and little to
creep in; Yet forasmuch as in Our own Royal Chapels, and in many other
Churches, most of them have been ever constantly used and observed, We cannot
now but be very sensible of this matter, and have cause to conceive that the
authors and fomentors of these jealousies, though they color the same with a
pretense of Zeal, and would seem to strike only at some supposed iniquity in
the said Ceremonies; Yet, as We have cause to fear, aim at Our own Royal
person, and would fain have Our good Subjects imagine that We Our Self are
perverted, and do worship God in a superstitious way, and that we intend to
bring in some alteration of the Religion here established. Now how far We are
from that, and how utterly We detest every thought therefore, We have by many
public Declarations, and otherwise upon sundry occasions, given such assurance
to the world, as that from thence We also assure Our Self, that no man of
wisdom and discretion could ever be so beguiled as to give any serious
entertainment to such brainsick jealousies; and for the weaker sort, who are
prone to be misled by cr^fty seducers, We rest no less confident, that even of
them, as many as are of loyal, or indeed but of charitable hearts, will from
henceforth utterly banish all such causlesse fears and surmises, upon these Our
sacred professions, so often made by Us, a Christian Defender of the Faith,
their King, and Sovereign. And therefore if yet any person, under whatsoever
mask of zeal or counterfeit holiness, shall henceforth by speech or writing,
or any other way (notwithstanding these Our right, hearty, faithful, and
solemn protestations made before him, whose Deputy We are against all and every
intention of any Popish innovation) be so ungracious and presumptuous as to
vent any poisoned conceits, tending to such a purpose, and to cast these
devilish aspersions and jealousies upon Our Royal and godly proceedings, We
require all Our loyal Subjects, that they forthwith make the same known to
some Magistrate, Ecclesiastical or Civil; And We straightly charge all
Ordinaries, and every other person in any authority under Us, as they will
answer the contrary at their utmost peril, that they use no palliation,
connivence, or delay therein; but that taking particular information of all the
passages, they do forthwith certify the same unto Our Court of Commission for
causes Ecclesiastical, to be there examined, and proceeded in with all
fidelity and tenderness of Our Royal Majesty, as is due to Us their
Sovereign Lord and Governor: But forasmuch as We well perceive that the
misleaders of Our well minded people, do make the more advantage for the
nourishing of this distemper among them from hence, that the foresaid Rites and
Ceremonies, or some of them, are now insisted upon but only in some Diocesses,
and are not generally revived in all places, nor constantly and uniformly
practiced thorowout all the Churches of Our Realm, and thereupon have been
liable to be quarrelled and opposed by t^em who use them not; We therefore out
of Our Princely inclination to Uniformity and peace, in matters especially that
concern the holy worship of God, proposing to Our self herein the pious
examples of King Edward the sixth, and of Queen Elizabeth, who sent forth
Injunctions, and Orders about the divine Service, and other Ecclesiastical
matters, and of Our dear Father of blessed memory, King James, who published a
book of Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical; and (according to the Act of
Parliament in this behalf) having fully advised herein with Our Metropolitan,
and with Our Commissioners authorized under Our great Seal for causes
Ecclesiastical, have thought good to give them free leave to treat in
Convocation, and agree upon certain other Canons necessary for the advancement
of Gods glory, the edifying of his holy Church, and the due reverence of his
blessed Mysteries and Sacraments: that as We ^ver have been, and by Gods
assistance (by whom alone We reign) shall ever so continue careful and ready
to cut off superstition with one hand, so We may no less expel irr^verence
and profaneness with the other, whereby it may please Almighty God, so to
bless Us, and this Church committed to Our government, that it may at once
return unto the true former splendor of Uniformity, Devotion, and holy Order,
the luster whereof for some years by past has been overmuch obscured, through
the devices of some ill affected to that Sacred Order, wherein it had long
stood from the very beginning of the Reformation, and through inadvertencie of
some in authority in the Church under Us: We therefore by virtue of Our
Prerogative Royal, and Supreme authority in causes Ecclesiastical, by Our
several and respective Letters Patents under Our Great Seal of England, dated
the fifteenth day of April now last past, and the twelfth day of May then next
following, for the Province of Canterbury; And by Our like Letters Patents
dated the seven and twentieth day of the same m^neth of April, and the
twentieth day of the month of May aforesaid, for the Province of York, did
give and grant, full, free, and lawful liberty, license, power and authority
unto the said Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, President of the said
Convocation, for the Province of Canterbury, and unto the said Lord Archbishop
of York, President of the said Convocation for the Province of York, and to the
rest of the Bishops of the said Provinces, and unto all Deanes of Cathedral
Churches, Archdeacons, Chapters and Colleges, and the whole Clergy of every
several Diocese, within the said several Provinces, and either of them, that
they should and might from time to time, during the present Parliament, and
further during Our will and pleasure, confer, treat, debate, consider,
consult, and agree of and upon Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions,
as they should think necessary, fit, and convenient for the honor and service
of Almighty God, the good and quiet of the Church, and the better government
thereof, to be from time to time observed, performed, fulfilled, and kept, as
well by the said Arch bishop of Canterbury, and the said Archbishop of York,
the Bishops, and their successors, and the rest of the whole Clergy of the
said several Provinces of Canterbury and York, in their several Callings,
Offices, Functions, Ministeries, Degrees, and Administrations; As by all and
every Dean of the Arches, and other Judges of the said several Archbishops,
of Courts Guardians of Spiritualties, Chancellours, Deanes and Chapters,
Archdeacons, Commissaries, Officials, Registers, and all and every other
Ecclesiastical Officers, and their inferior Ministers whatsoever, of the same
respective Provinces of Canterbury and York, in their, and every of their
distinct Courts, and in the order and manner of their, and every of their
proceedings, and by all other persons within this Realm, as far as lawfully
being members of the Church it may concern them, as in Our said Letters Patents
amongst other Clauses more at large does appear.

Now forasmuch as the said Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, President of the
said Convocation for the Province of Canterbury, and the said Archbishop of
York, President of said Convocation for the Province of York, and others the
said Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, Chapters and Colleges, with the rest of the
Clergy, having met together respectively, at the time and places before
mentioned respectively, and then and there, by virtue of Our said authority
granted unto them, treated of, concluded, and agreed upon certain Canons,
Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, to the end and purpose of Us limited and
prescribed unto them, and have thereupon offered and presented the same unto
Us, most humbly desiring Us to give Our Royal assent unto the same, according
to the form of a certain Statute or Act of Parliament made in that behalf in
the 25th. year of the Reign of King Henry the eighth, and by Our said
Prerogative Royal and Supreme authority in Causes Ecclesiastical, to ratify
by Our Letters Patents under Our great Seal of England, and to confirm the
same, The Title and Tenor of them being word for word as ensues.

Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, treated upon by the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, Presidents of the Convocations for the respective
Provinces of Canterbury and York, and the rest of the Bishops and Clergy of
those Provinces: And agreed upon with the Kings Majesty's License in their
several Synods begun at London and York 1640.
In the year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, CHARLES, by the grace of God,
King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, and Sixteenth.
I. Concerning the Regal power.
WHereas sundry Laws, Ordinances, and Constitutions have been formerly made
for the acknowledgment and profession of the most lawful and independent
authority of our dread Sovereign Lord, the Kings most Excellent Majesty, over
the State Ecclesiastical and Civil: We (as our duty in the first place binds
us, and so far as to us appertains) enjoin them all to be carefully observed
by all persons whom they concern, upon the penalties in the said Laws and
Const^tutions expressed.

And for the ^uller and clearer instruction and information of all Christian
people within this Realm in their duties in this particular;

We do further ordain and decree, That every Parson, Vicar, Curate, or Preacher
upon some one Sunday in every quarter of the year at Morning prayer, shall in
the place where he serves, treatably, and audibly read these explanations of
the Regal power here inserted.

THE most High and Sacred order of Kings is of Divine right, being the
ordinance of God himself, founded in the prime Laws of nature, and clearly
established by express texts both of the old and new Testaments. A supreme
Power is given to this most excellent Order by God himself in the Scriptures,
which is, That Kings should rule and command in their several dominions all
persons of what rank or estate soever, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, and
that they should restrain and punish with the temporal sword all stubborn and
wicked doers.

The care of Gods Church is so committed to Kings in the Scripture that they
are commend^d when the Church keeps the right way, and taxed when it runs
amiss, and therefore her government belongs in chief unto Kings: For oth^rwise
one man would be commended for another care, and taxed but for another
negligence, which is not Gods way.

The power to call and dissolve Councels both national and provincial is the
true right of all Christian Kings within their own Realms or Territories: And
when in the first times of Christ's Church, Prelates used this power, 'twas
therefore only because in those days they had no Christian Kings: And it was
then so only used as in times of persecution, that is, with supposition (in
case it were requir^d) of submitting their very lives unto the very Laws and
Commands even of those Pagan Princes, that they might not so much as seem to
disturb their Civil Government, which Christ came to confirm, but by no means
to undermine.

For any person or persons to set up, maintain, or avow in any their said
Realms or Territories respectively, under any pretense whatsoever, any
independent Coactive power, either Papal or Popular (whether directly or
indirectly) is to undermine their great Royal office, and cunningly to
overthrow that most Sacred ordinance, which God himself has established: And
so is treasonable against God, as well as against the King.

For subjects to bear Arms against their Kings, offensive or defensive, upon
any pretense whatsoever, is (...) the least to resist the Powers, which are
ordained of God: And though they do not inv^de, but only resist, St. Paul tells
them plainly, They shall receive to themselves damnation.

And although Tribute, and Custom, and Aid, and Subsidy, and all manner of
necessary support and s^pply, be respectively due to Kings from their subjects
by the Law of God, Nature, and Nations, for the public defense, care and
protection of them: yet n^verthelesse, subjects have not only possession of,
but a true and just right, title and property, to, and in all their goods and
estates, and ought so to have: And these two are so far from ^rossing one
another, that they mutually go together, for the honorable and comfortable
support of both. For as it is the duty of the subjects to supply their King:
so is it part of the Kingly office to support his subjects in the property and
freedom of their estates.

And if any Parson, Vicar, Curate, or Preacher shall voluntarily or carelessly
neglect his duty in publishing the said explications and conclusions, according
to the Order above prescribed, he shall be suspended by his Ordinary, till such
time as upon his penitence he shall give sufficient assurance, or evidence of
his amendment; and in case he be of any exempt jurisdiction, he shall be
Censurable by his Majesty's Commissioners for Causes Ecclesiastical.

And we do also hereby require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other
inferior Pries^s and Ministers, that they preach, teach, and exhort their
people to obey, honor, and serve their King; and that they presume not to
speak of his Majesty's power in any other way then in this Canon is expressed.
And if any Parson, Vicar, Curate, Preacher, or any other Ecclesiastical person
whatsoever, any Deane, Canon, or Prebendarie of any Collegiate or Cathedral
Church, any member or Student of College or Hall, or any Reader of Divinity,
or Humanity in either of the Universities, or elsewhere, shall in any Sermon,
Lecture, Common place, Determination, or Disputation either by word or writing,
publicly maintain or abett any position or conclusion, in opposition or
impeachment of the aforesaid explications, or any part or article of them, he
shall forthwith by the power of his Majesty's Commissioners for Causes
Ecclesiastical, be excommunicated till he repent, and suspended two years from
all the profits of his Benefice, or other Ecclesiastical, Academicall, or
Scholasticall preferments: And if he so offend a second time, he shall be
deprived from all his spiritual promotions, of what nature or degree soever
they be.

Provided always, that if the offense aforesaid be given in either of the
Universities, by men not having any Benefice or Ecclesiastical preferment,
that then the delinquent shall be censured by the ordinary authority in such
Cases of that University respectively, where the said fault shall be committed.

II. For the better keeping of the day of his Majesty's most happy Inauguration.
THe Synod taking into consideration the most inestimable benefits which this
Church enjoys, under the peaceable and blessed government of our dread
Sovereign Lord, King CHARLES; And finding that as well the godly Christian
Emperors in the former times, as our own most religious Princes since the
Reformation, have caused the days of their Inaugurations to be publicly
celebrated by all their Subjects, with Pray^rs and Thanksgiving to Almighty
God; and that there is a particular form of Prayer appointed by authority for
that day and purpose; And yet with all considering how negligent some people
are in the observance of this day, in many places of this Kingdom^ Does
therefore decree and ordain, that all manner of persons within the Church of
Englan^, shall from henceforth celebrate, and keep the morning of the said day,
in coming diligently and reverently unto their Parish Church or Chapp^ll at the
time of Prayer, and there continuing all the while, that the prayers,
preaching, or other service of the day endures; in testimony of their humble
gratitude to God for so great a blessing, and dutiful affections to so benign
and merciful a Sovereign. And for the better execution of this our Ordinance,
the holy Synod does straightly require and charge, and by authority hereof
enableth all Archbishops, Bishops, D^anes, Deanes and Chapters, Archdeacons,
and other Ecclesiastical persons, having exempt or peculiar jurisdiction; as
also all, Chancellors, Commissaries, and Officialls in the Church of England,
that they enquire into the keeping of the same in their Visitations, and punish
such as they shall find to be delinquent, according as by Law they are to
censure, and punish those who wilfully absent themselves from Church on
Holidays. And that the said day may be the better observed, We do enjoin, that
all Churchwardens shall provide at the Parish charge, two of those books at
least, appointed for that day, and if there be any want of the said book in any
Parish, they shall present the same at all Visitations respectively.

III. For suppressing of the growth of Popery.
ALl and every Eccl^siasticall persons, of what rank^ or condition soever,
Archbishops, and Bishops, Deanes, Arch deacons, all having exempt or p^culiar
jurisdiction, with their several Chancellours, Commissaries, and Officials,
all persons entrusted with cure of souls, shall us^ r^spectiv^ly all possible
car^ and di^igence by conferring privately with the parties, and by ^ensures of
the Church in inferior and higher Courts, as also by complaints unto the
S^cular power, to reduce all such to the Church of England, who are misl^d into
Popish superstition.

And first these private Conferences shall be performed in each several
Diocese, either by the Bishop in person, if his occasion will permit it, or by
some one or more learned Ministers at his special appointment, and the said
Bishop shall also design the time and place of the said several Conferenc^s,
and all such persons as shall be present ther^at^ which if Recusants refuse to
observe, they shall be taken for obstinate, and so certified to the Bishop. And
if the said ti^e and place be not observed by the Minister or Ministers so
appointed, they shall be suspended by their Ordinary for the space of six
months, without a very reasonable cause alleged to the contrary. Provided
that they be not ^ent above ten miles from their dwelling.

If the said Conferences prevail not, the Church must and shall come to her
Censures, and to make way for them, the said Ecclesi^sticall persons shall
carefully inform themselves in the places belonging to their several charges,
of all Recusants above the age of twelve years, both of such as come not at all
to Church, as also of those who coming sometimes thither, do yet refuse to
receive the holy Eucharist with us, as likewise of all those, who shall either
say, or hear Mass: and they shall in a more especial manner enquire o^t all
those, who are ^ither dangerously active to seduce any persons from the
Communion of the Church of England, o^ s^ditiously busy to dissuade his
Majesty's subjects from taking the oath of Allegiance, together with all them
who abused by their Sophistry, refuse to take the said oath.

And we straigh^ly command all Parsons, Vi^ars, and Curates, that they
carefully, and severally present at all Visitations, the names and surnam^s of
the delinquents of these several kinds in their own parishes, under pain of
suspension for s^^ months.

And likewise we straightly enjoin all Churchwardens and the like sworn
Offic^rs whatsoever, that by virtue o^ their o^thes, they shall present at the
said Visitations the names of such persons, whom they know or hear of, or
justly suspect to be delinq^ent, in all or any of these particulars, and that
under the pains of the highest censures of the Church: that so these
delinquents may be legally cited, and being ^ound obstinate, they shall be
excommun^cated, and such excommunication shall be pronounced both in the
Cathedral Church of the Diocese, and in the several Parishes where such
Recusants live, and every third month they shall be again publicly repeated
in the places aforesaid, that all may take notice of those Sentenc^s.

And because there are places which either have, or pretend to have exemptions,
in which such delinquents do usually affect to make their abode; Therefore we
enjoin, that all Bishops shall within their several Diocesses, send unto such
places one or more of their Chaplains, or some of their officers whom they may
rely on, to make strict inquiry after o^f^nders in those kinds, who
diligently returning their information accordingly, the said Bishop shall
certify such informations to his Metropolitan, that the aforesaid proceedings
may forthwith issue from some higher Courts in these cases, whereof by reason
of the said exemptions the inf^riour Courts can take no cognisance^

Bu^ if neith^r Conf^rring nor Censures will prevail with such persons, the
Church has no way left but complaints to the secular power; and for them we
s^^aitly enjoin, that all Deanes and Archdeacons, and all having inferior or
exempt Jurisdiction, shall every year within six months after any Visitation
by them holden, make Certificate unto their several Bishops, or Archbishop,
(if it be within his Diocese) under their Seal of Office, of all such persons
who have been presented unto them as aforesaid, under pain of suspension from
their said Jurisdictions by the space of one whole year.

And we in like manner enjoyne all Archbishops and Bishops, that once every
year at the least, they certify under their Episcopal Seal in Parchment,
unto the Justices of Assise of every County in the Circuits and within their
Diocesses respectively, the names and sirnames not only of those who have been
presented unto them from the said Deanes, Archdeacons, etc. but of those also
who upon the oaths of Churchwardens and other sworn men at their
Visitations, or upon the information of Ministers employed in the said
Conferences, have been presented unto them, that so the said intended
proceedings may have the more speedy and the more general success.

In particular, it shall be carefully inquired into at all Visitations under
the oaths of the Churchwardens and other sworn men, what Recusants or Popish
persons have been either married or buried, or have had their children baptized
otherwise then according unto the Rules and Forms established in the Church of
England; and the names of such delinquents (if they can learn them, or
otherwise such names as for the time they carry) shall be as aforesaid given up
to the Bishop, who shall present them to the Justices of Assise, to be
punished according to the Statutes.

And for the education of Recusants children, since by Canon already
established, no man can teach School, (no not in any private house) except he
be allowed by the Ordinary of the place, and withal have subscribed to the
Articles of Religion established in the Church of England; We therefore
straightly enjoyne, that forthwith at all Visitations there be diligent
enquiry made by the Churchwardens or other sworn Ecclesiastical Officers of
each Parish, under their oaths, who are employed, as Schoolmasters to the
children of Recusants; and that their several names be presented to the Bishop
of the Diocese, who citing the said Schoolmasters shall make diligent search
whether they have subscribed or no; and if they or any of them be found to
refuse subscription, they shall be forbidden to teach hereafter, and censured
for their former presumption; and withal the names of him or them that
entertain such a Schoolmasters, shall be certified to the Bishop of the
Diocese, who shall at the next Assise present them to the Judges to be
proceeded against according to the Statutes. And if they subscribe, enquiry
shall be made what care they take for the instruction of the said children in
the Catechism established in the Book of Common Prayer. And all Ordinaries
shall censure those whom they find negligent in the said instruction; and if
it shall appear, that the Parents of the said children do forbid such
Schoolmasters to bring them up in the Doctrine of the Church of England, they
shall notwithstanding do their duty; and if thereupon the said Parents shall
take away their children, the said Schoolmasters shall forthwith give up
their names unto the Bishop of the Diocese, who shall take care to return
them to the Justices of Assise in manner and form aforesaid. And because some
may cunningly elude this Decree, by sending their children to be bred beyond
the seas, Therefore we ordain that the Churchwardens and other sworn
Ecclesiastical Officers shall likewise make careful enquiry, and give in upon
their oaths at all Visitations, the names of such Recusants children, who are
so sent beyond the seas to be bred there, or whom they probably suspect to be
so sent: which names as aforesaid shall be given up to the Bishop, and from him
returned to the Judges as aforesaid, that their Parents, who so send them, may
be punished according to Law. Provided always that this Canon shall not take
away or derogate from any power or authority already given or established by
any other Canon now in force.

And all the said Complaints or Certificates shall be presented up to the
Judges in their several Circuits by the Bishops Register, or some other of his
Deputies immediately after the publishing of his Majesty's Commission, or at
the end of the charge, which shall be then given by the Judge. And this upon
pain of Suspension for three months.

This sacred Synod does earnestly entreat the said Reverend Justices of
Assise, to be careful in the execution of the said Laws committed to their
trust, as they will answer to God for the daily increase of this gross kind
of superstition. And further, we do also exhort all Judges, whether
Ecclesiastical or Tempo^all upon the like account, that they would not admit in
any of their Courts any vexatious Complaint, Suit or Suits, or Presentiments
against any Minister, Churchwardens, Questmen, Sidemen, or other
Church Officers for the making of any such Presentiments.

And lastly, we enjoyne that every Bishop shall once in every year send into
his Majesty's High Court of Chancery, a Significavit of the names and sirnames
of all such Recusants who have stood excommunicated beyond the time limited by
the Law, and shall desire that the Writ De excommunicato cap^endo might be at
once sent out against them all Ex Officio. And for the better execution of this
Decree, this present Synod does most humbly beseech his most sacred Majesty,
that the Officers of the said High Court of Chancery, whom it shall concern,
may be commanded to send out the aforesaid Writ from time to time as is
desired, for that it would much exhaust the particular estates of the
Ordinaries, to sue out several Writs at their own charge. And that the like
command also may be laid upon the Sheriffs and their Deputies, for the due and
faithful execution of the said Writs, as often as they shall be brought unto
them.

And to the end that this Canon may take the better and speedier effect, and
not to be deluded or delayed; We further decree and ordain, That no Popish
Recusant, who shall persist in the said sentence of Excommunication, beyond the
time prescribed by Law, shall be absolved by virtue of any Appeal in any
Ecclesiastical Court, unless the said party shall first in his or her own
person, and not by a Proctor, take the usual Oath De parendo Iuri, and stando
mandatis Ecclesiae.

IV. Against Socinianisme.
WHEREAS much mischief is already done in the Church of God by the spreading
of the damnable and cursed Heresy of SOCINIANISME, as being a complication of
many ancient Heresies condemned by the four first general Councels, and
contrariant to the Articles of Religion now established in the Church of
England: And whereas it is too apparent that the said wicked and blasphemous
errors are unhappily dilated by the frequent divulgation and dispersion of
dangerous Books written in favor and furtherance of the same, whereby many,
especially of the younger or unsettled sort of people, may be poisoned and
infected: It is therefore decreed by this present Synod, That no Stationer,
Printer, or Importer of the said Books, or any other person whatsoever, shall
print, buy, sell, or disperse any Book, broaching or maintaining of the said
abominable Doctrine or Positions, upon pain of Excommunication ipso facto to
be thereupon incurred: And we require all Ordinaries upon pain of the
Censures of the Church, that beside the Excommunication aforesaid, they do
certify their names and offenses under their Episcopal Seal to the
Metropolitan, by him to be delivered to his Majesty's Attorney General for the
time being, to be proceeded withal according to the late Decree, in the
Honorable Court of Star Chamber, against spreaders of prohibited Books. And
that no Preacher shall presume to vent any such Doctrine in any Sermon under
pain of Excommunication for the first offense, and Deprivation for the second.
And that no Student in either of the Universities of this Land, nor any person
in holy Orders, (excepting Graduates in Divinity, or such as have Episcopal or
Archidiaconall Jurisdiction, or Doctors of Law in holy Orders) shall be
suffered to have or read any such Socinian Book or discourse, under pain (if
the offender live in the University) that he shall be punished according to the
strictest Statutes provided there against the publishing, reading, or
maintaining of false Doctrine; or if he live in the City or Country abroad, of
a Suspension for the first offense, and Excommunication for the second, and
Deprivation for the third, unless he will absolutely and in terminis abjure
the same. And if any Layman shall be seduced into this opinion, and be
convicted of it, he shall be excommunicated, and not absolved but upon due
repentance and abjuration, and that before the Metropolitan, or his own
Bishop at the least. And we likewise enjoyne, that such Books, if they be
found in any prohibited hand, shall be immediately burned: and that there be a
diligent search made by the appointment of the Ordinary after all such Books,
in what hands soever, except they be now in the hands of any Graduate in
Divinity, and such as have Episcopal or Archidiaconall Jurisdiction, or any
Doctor of Laws in holy Orders as aforesaid; and that all who now have them,
except before excepted, be strictly commanded to bring in the said Books, in
the Universities to the Vice-chancellors, and out of the Universities to the
Bishops, who shall return them to such whom they dare trust with the reading
of the said Books, and shall cause the rest to be burned. And we farther
enjoyne, that diligent enquiry be made after all such that shall maintain and
defend the aforesaid Socinianisme, and when any such shall be detected, that
they be complained of to the several Bishops respectively, who are required by
this Synod to repress them from any such propagation of the aforesaid wicked
and detestable opinions.

V. Against Sectaries.
WHEREAS there is a provision now made by a Canon for the suppressing of
Popery and the growth thereof by subjecting all Popish Recusants to the
greatest severitie of Ecclesiastical Censures in that behalf: This present
Synod well knowing that there are other Sects which endeavor the subversion
both of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England no less then
Papists do, although by another way; for the preventing thereof does hereby
decree and ordain, That all those proceedings and penalties which are mentioned
in the aforesaid Canon against Popish Recusants as far as they shall be
appliable, shall stand in full force and vigor against all Anabaptists,
Brownists, Separatists, Familists, or other Sect or Sects, person or persons
whatsoever, who do or shall, either obstinately refuse, or ordinarily, not
having a lawful impediment (that is, for the space of a month) neglect to
repair to their Parish Churches or Chapels where they inhabit, for the hearing
of Divine Service established, and receiving of the holy Communion, according
to Law.

And we do also further decree and ordain, that the Clause contained in the
Canon now made by this Synod against the Books of Socinianisme, shall also
extend to the makers, importers, printers, and publishers, or dispersers of any
Book, writing, or scandalous Pamphlet devised against the discipline and
government of the Church of England, and unto the maintainers and abettors of
any opinion or doctrine against the same.

And further, because there are sprung up among us a sort of factious people,
despisers and depravers of the Book of Common prayer, who do not according to
the Law resort to their parish Church or Chapel, to join in the public
prayers, service, and worship of God with the congregation, contenting
themselves with the hearing of Sermons only, thinking thereby to avoid the
penalties due to such as wholly absent themselves from the Church. We therefore
for the restraint of all such wilful contemners or neglecters of the Service
of God, do ordain that the Church or Chapel Wardens, and Questmen, or Sidemen
of every parish, shall be careful to enquire out all such disaffected persons,
and shall present the names of all such d^linquents at all Visitations of
Bishops, and other Ordinaries; And that the same proceedings and penalties
m^ntioned in the Canon aforesaid respectively, shall be used against them as
against other Recusants, unless within one whole month after they are first
denounced, they shall make acknowledgement and reformation of that their fault.
Provided always, that this Canon shall not derogat^ from any other Canon, Law,
or Statute in that behalf provided against those Sectaries.

VI. An Oath enjoined for the preventing of all Innovations in Doctrine and
Government.
THis present Synod (being desirous to declare their sincerity and constancy
in the profession of the Doctrine and Discipline already established in the
Church of England, and to secure all men against any suspicion of revolt to
Popery, or any other superstition) decrees that all Archbishops, and Bishops,
and all other Priests and Deacons in places ^xempt or not exempt, shall before
the second day of November next ensuing^ take this Oath following against all
Innovation of Doctrine or Discipline, and this Oath shall be tendered them, and
every of them, and all others named after in this Canon, by the Bishop in
person, or his Chancelour, or some grave Divines named and appointed by the
Bishop under his seal; and the said Oath shall be taken in the presence of a
public Notarie, who is hereby r^quired to make an Act of it, leaving the
Universities to the Provision which follows.

The Oath is:
I A. B. Do swear, That I do approve the Doctrine and Discipline or Government
established in the Church of England, as containing all things necessary to
salvation: And that I will not endeavor by my self or any other, directly or
indirectly, to bring in any Popish Doctrine, contrary to that which is so
established: Nor will I ever give my consent to alt^r the Government of this
Church, by Archbishops, Bishops, Deanes, and Archdeacons, etc. as it stands
now established, and as by right it ought to stand, nor yet ever to subject it
to the usurpations and superstitions of the Sea of Rome. And all these things I
do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear, according to the plain and
common sense and understanding of the same words, without any equivocation, o^
mental evasion, or secret r^servation whatsoever. And this I do heartily,
willingly, and truly, upon the faith of a Christian. So help me God, in Jesus
Christ.

And if any man Benefic^d or Dignified in the Church of England, or any other
Ecclesiastical person shall refuse to take this Oath, the Bishop shall give
him a months time to inform himself, and at the months end, if he refuse to
take it, he shall be suspended ab Officio, and have a second month granted:
and if then he refuse to take it, he shall b^ suspended ab O^fi^io and
Beneficio, and have a third month granted him for his better information: but
if at the end of that month he refuse to take the Oath abovenamed, he shall
by the Bishop be deprived of all his Eccl^siasticall Promotions whatsoever, and
execution of his function which he holds in the Church of England.

And we likewise Constitute and Ordain, That all Masters of Arts (the sons of
Noblemen only excepted) all Bachelours and Doctors in Divinity, Law, or
Physic, all that are licenced to practice Physic, all Registers, Actuaries,
and Proctors, all Schoolmasters, all such as being natives or naturalized, do
come to be incorporated into the Universities here, having taken a Degree in
any foreign Unive^sity, shall be bound to take the said Oath. And we command
all Governors of Colleges and Halls in either of the Universities, that they
administer this said Oath to all persons resident in their several Houses that
have taken the degrees before mentioned in this Canon, within six months after
the publication hereof.

And we likewise Constitute, That all Bishops shall be bound to give the said
Oath unto all those to whom they give holy Orders, at the time of their
Ordination, or to whomsoever they give Collation, Institution, or License to
Preach, or serve any Cure.

VII. A Declaration concerning some Rites and Ceremonies.
BEcause it is generally to be wished, that unity of Faith were accompanied
with uniformity of practis^, in the outward worship and service of God; chiefly
for the avoiding of groundless suspit^ons of those who are weak, and the
malicious aspersions of the professed enemies of our Religion; the one fearing
Innovations, the other flattering themselves with a vain hope of our
backslidings unto their Popish superstition, by reason of the situation of the
Communion Table, and the approaches thereunto, the Synod declares, as
followeth^

That the standing of the Communion Table, side-way under the East window of
every Chancell, or Chapel, is in its own nature indifferent, neither
commanded nor condemned by the Word of God, either expressly, or by immediate
deduction, and therefore that no Religion is to be placed therein, or scruple
to be made thereon. And albeit at the time of reforming this Church from that
gross superstition of Popery, it was carefully provided that all means should
be used to root out of the minds of the people, both the inclination
thereunto, and memory thereof; especially of the Idolatry committed in the
Mass, for which cause all Popish Altars were demolished: yet notwithstanding
it was then ordered by the Injunctions and Advertisements of Queen Elizabeth,
of blessed memory, that the holy Tables should stand in the place where the
Altars stood, and accordingly have been continued in the Royal Chappells of
three famous and pious Princes, and in most Cathedral, and some Parochial
Churches, which does sufficiently acquit the manner of placing the said Tables
from any illegality, or just suspicion of Popish superstition or innovation.
And therefore we judge it fit and convenient, that all Churches and Chapels do
conform themselves in this particular, to the example of the Cathedral, or
Mother Churches, saving always the general liberty left to the Bishop by Law,
during the time of Administration of the holy Communion. And we declare that
this situation of the holy Table, does not imply that it is, or ought to be
esteemed a true and proper Altar, whereon Christ is again really sacrificed:
but it is, and may be called an Altar by us, in that sense in which the
Primitive Church called it an Altar, and in no other.

And because experience has showed us, how irreverent the behavior of many
people is in many plac^^, some leaning, others casting their hats, and some
sitting upon, some standing, and others sitting under the Communion Table in
time of Divine Service: for the avoiding of these and the like abu^^s, it is
thought meet and convenient by this present Synod, that the said Communion
Tables in all Chancells or Chappells, be decently severed with Rails to
preserve them from such or worse profanations.

And because the Administration of holy things is to be performed with all
possible decency and reverence, therefor we judge it fit and convenient,
according to the word of the Service Book established by Act of Parliament,
Draw near, etc. that all Communicants with all humble reverence shall draw near
and approach to the holy Table, there to receive the divine Mysteries, which
have heretofore in some places been unfitly carried up and down by the
Minister, unless it shall be otherwise appointed in respect of the incapacity
of the place, or other inconvenience^ by the Bishop himself in his
jurisdiction, and other Ordinaries respectively in theirs.

And lastly, whereas the Church is the house of God, dedicated to his holy
worship, and therefore ought to mind us, both o^ the greatness and goodness
of his Divine Majesty, certain it is that the acknowledgement thereof, not
only inwardly in our hearts, but also outwardly with our bodies, must needs be
pious in it self, profitable unto us, and edifying unto others. We therefore
think it very meet and behoovefull, and heartily commend it to all good and
well affected people, members of this Church, that they be ready to tender unto
the Lord the said acknowledgement, by doing reverence and obeisance, both at
their coming in, and going out of the said Churches, Chancels, or Chapels,
according to the most ancient custom of the Primitive Church in the purest
times, and of this Church also for many years of the Reign of Qu^en Elizabeth.
The reviving therefore of this ancient and la^dable custom, we heartily
commend to the serious consid^ration of all good people, not with any intention
to exhibit any Religious worship to the Communion Table, the East, or Church,
or any thing therein contained in so doing, or to perform the said gesture, in
the celebration of the holy Eucha^ist, upon any opinion of a corporal p^esence
of the body of Jesus Christ, on the holy Table, or in the mystical elements,
but only for the advancement of Gods Majesty, and to give him alone that
honor and glory that is due unto him, and no otherwise; and in the practice or
omission of this Rite, we desire that the rule of Charity prescribed by the
Apostle, may be observed, which is, That they which use this Rite despise not
them who use it not, and that they who use it not, condemn not those that use
it.

VIII. Of Preaching for Conformity.
WHer^as the Preaching of Order and Decency, according to St Paul's rule, does
conduce to edification; it is required, that all Preachers (as well Benefic^d
men as others) shall positively and plainly Preach and In^truct the people in
their public Sermons twice in the year at the least, that the Rites and
Ceremonies now established in the Church of England are lawful and
commendable, and that they the said people and others, ought to conform
themselves in their practice to all the said Rites and Ceremonies, and that the
people and others ought willingly to submit themselves unto the authority and
government of the Church as it is now established under the Kings Majesty. And
if any Preacher shall refuse or neglect to do according to this Canon, let him
be suspended by his Ordinary, during the time of his refusal, or wilful
forbearance to do thereafter.

IX. One Book of Articles of inquiry to be used at all Parochial Visitations.
FOr the better settling of an Uniformity in the outward government and
administration of the Church, and for the more preventing of just grievances
which may be laid upon Churchwardens and other Sworn-men, by any impertin^nt,
inconvenient, or illegal enquiries in the Articles for Ecclesiastical
Visitations; This Synod has now caus^d a Summary or Collection of Visi^^tory
Articles (out of the Rubricks of the Service Book, and the Canons and
warrantable Rules of the Church) to be made, and for future direction to be
deposited in the Records of the Archbishop of Canterbury: and we do decree and
ordain, that from henceforth no Bishop or other person whatsoever having right
to hold, use, or exercise any Parochial Visitation, shall (under the pain of a
Months suspension upon a Bishop, and two Months upon any other Ordinary that
is delinquent, and this to be incurred ipso facto) cause to be printed or
published, or otherwise to be given in charge to the Church-warden^, or to any
other persons which shall be sworn to make Presentm^nts, any other Articles or
forms of enquiry upon oath, then such only as shall be approved and in
terminis allowed unto him (upon due request made) by his Metropolitan under his
Seal of Office.

Provided always that after the end of three years next following the date of
these presents, the Metropolitan shall not either at the instance of those which
have right to hold Parochial Visitations, o^ upon any other occasion, make any
addition or diminution from that allowance to any Bishop, of Visitatory
Articles, which he did last before (in any Diocese, within his Province)
approve of; But calling for the same shall hold and give that only for a
perpetual Rule, and then every Pa^ish shall be bound only to take the said Book
from the Archdeacons and other having a Peculiar or exempt Jurisdiction, but
once from that time, in three years, in case they do make it appear that they
have the said Book remaining in their public Ch^st for the use of the Parish:
And from ev^ry Bishop they shall receive the said Articles at the Episcopal
Visitation only, and in manner and form as formerly they have been accustomed
to do, and at no greater price then what has bin usually paid in the said
Diocese respectively.

X. Concerning the Conversation of the Clergy.
THe sober, grave^ and exemplary Conversation of al those that are employed in
Administration of holy things, being of great avail for the furtherance of
pietie^ It has be^n the Religious care of the Church of England, strictly to
enjoin to all and every one of her Clergy, a pious, regular, and inoffensive
d^meanour^ and to prohibit all loose and scandalous carriage by severe censures
to be inflicted upon such delinquents, as appears by the 74. and 75. Canons
Anno 1603. provided to this purpose.

For the more ^ffectuall success of which pious and necessary care, this
present Synod, straightly charges all Clergy men in this Church, that setting
before their ^yes the glory of God, the holin^sse of their calling, and the
edification of the people committed to them, they carefully avoid all excess
and disorder, and that by their Christian and Religious conversation they shine
forth as lights unto others in all godliness and honesty.

And we also require all those to whom the Government of the Clergy of this
Church is committed, that they set themselves to countenance and encourage
godliness, gravitie, sobriety, and all unblameable conversation in the
Ministers of this Church, and that according to the power with which they are
entrusted, they diligently labor by the due execution of the above named
Canons, and all other Ecclesiastical provisions made for this end, to reform
all offensive and scandalous persons, if any be in the Ministry, as they
tender the welfare and prospering of Piety and Religion, and as they will
answer to God for those scandals, which through their remissness and neglect
shall arise and grow in this Church of Christ.

XI. Chancellours Patents.
FOr the better remedying and redress of such abuses as are complained of in
the Ecclesiastical Courts, the Synod does Decree and ordain, that hereafter
no Bishop shall Grant any Patent to any Chanc^llour, Commissarie, or
Official, for any longer term, then the life of the Grauntee only, nor
otherwise then with express reservation to himself, and his Successors, of
the power to execute the said place, either alone, or with the Chancellor, if
the Bishop shall please to do the same, saving always to the said Chancellors,
etc. the Fees accustomably taken for executing the said jurisdiction. And that
in all such Patents, the Bishop shall keep in his own hands the power of
Institution unto Benefices, as also of giving Licenses to preach or keep
school; And further, that no Deane and Chapter confirm any Patent of any
Chancellor, Commissaries, or Officials place, wherein the said conditions are
not expressed sub po^na suspensionis, to the Deane (or his locum tenens if he
pass the Act in his absence) and to every Canon, or Prebendary, voting to the
confirmation of the said Act, to be inflicted by the Archbishop of the
Province. And further, the holy Synod does decree and ordain that no reward
shall be taken for any Chancellours, Commissaries or Officials place under the
heaviest Censures of the Church.

XII. Chancellours alone not to Censure any of the Clergy in sundry Cases.
That no Chancellor, Commissarie, or Official, unless he be in holy Orders,
shall proceed to Suspension, or any higher Censure against any of the Clergy
in any criminal cause, other then neglect of appearance, upon legal citing,
but that all such causes shall be heard by the Bishop in person, or with the
assistance of his Chancellor, or Commissarie; or if the Bishops occasions will
not permit, then by his Chancellor, or Commissarie, and two grave dignified,
or benficed Ministers of the Diocese to be assigned by the Bishop, under his
Episcopal seal, who shall hear and censure the said cause in the Consistory.

XIII. Excommunication and absolution not to be pronounced but by a Priest.
THat no excommunications or absolutions shall be good or valid in Law, except
they be pronounced, either by the Bishop in person, or by some other in holy
Orders, having Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, or by some grave Minister
beneficed in the Diocese, being a Master of Arts, at least, and appointed by
the Bishop, and the Priests name pronouncing such sentence of excommunication,
or absolution to be expressed in the Instrument issuing under seal out of the
Court. And that no such Minister shall pronounce any sentence of absolution but
in open Consistory, or at the least in a Church or Chapel, the penitent
humbly craving and taking absolution upon his knees, and having first taken the
Oath, De parendo juri and stando mandatis Ecclesiae. And that no Parson, Vicar,
or Curate, sub poena suspensionis, shall declare any of his or their
Parishioners to be excommunicate, or shall admit any of them so excommunicate
into the Church, and there declare them to be absolved, except they first
receive such excommunications and absolutions under the seal of the
Ecclesiastical Judge, from whom it comes.

XIIII. Concerning Commutations, and the disposing of them.
THat no Chancellor, Commissary, or Official, shall have power to commute any
penance in whole, or in part; but either together with the Bishop in person, or
with his privity in writing, or if by himself, there he shall give up a full
and just account of all such Commutations once every year, at Michaelmas to the
Bishop, who shall with his Chancellor, see that all such moneys be disposed of
to charitable and public uses, according to Law. And if any Chancellor or
other, having jurisdiction, as aforesaid, shall not make such a just account to
the Bishop, and be found guilty of it, he shall be suspended from all exercise
of his jurisdiction, for the space of one whole year.

Always provided, that if the crime be publicly complained of, and do appear
notorious, that then the Office shall signify to the place, from whence the
complaint came, that the delinquent has satisfied the Church for his offense.
And the Minister shall signify it as he shall be directed; saving always to
all Chancellers, and other Ecclesiastical Officers their due and accustomable
fees, if he or they be not so suspended as aforesaid.

XV. Touching concurrent Jurisdictions.
THat in such places wherein^ there is concurrent Jurisdiction, no Executor be
cited into any Court or Office, for the space of ten days after the death of
the Testator. And that as well every Apparitor herein, as every Register, or
Clark that gives or carries out any Citation or Process to such intent,
before that the said ten days be expired, shall for the first Offense herein,
be suspended from the execution of his Office, for the space of three Months;
and for the second Offense, in this kind, be and stand excommunicated, ipso
facto, not to be restored, but by the Metropolitan of the Province, or his
lawful Surrogate; And that yet nevertheless, it be lawful for any Executor,
to prove such Wills when they think good, within the said ten days, before
any Ecclesiastical Judge respectively, to whose jurisdiction the same may, or
does appertain.

XVI. Concerning Licenses to Marry.
WHereas diverse Licenses to Marry, are granted by Ordinaries, in whose
Jurisdiction, neither of the parties, desiring such License, is resident; to
the prejudice of the Archiepiscopall prerogative: to whom only the power of
granting such Licenses, to parties of any Jurisdiction, per totam provinciam,
by Law belongs; and for other great inconv^niences thereupon ensuing. It is
therefore decreed, That no License of Marriage shall be granted by any Ordinary
to any parties, unless one of the said parties have been commorant in the
Jurisdiction of the said Ordin^ry, for the space of one whole Month,
immediately before the said License be desired. And if any O^dinary shall
offend herein, and be sufficien^ly evinced thereof, in any of the Lord
Archbishops Courts, he shall be liable to such censure as the Lord Archbishop
shall think fit to inflict. And we further decree, That one of the Conditions
in the Bond of security given by the parties taking such License, shall be,
that the said partie^, or one of them, have, or has been a Month commorant
in the said Jurisdiction, immediately before the said License granted.

And the Synod decrees, That whatsoever is ordered in these six last Canons,
concerning the Jurisdiction of Bishops, their Chancellors, and Commissaries,
shall (so far as by Law is applyable) be in force, concerning all Deanes,
Deanes and Chapters, Collegiate Churches, Archdeacons, and all in holy Orders,
having exempt, or peculiar Jurisdiction, and their several Officers
respectively.

XVII. Against vexatious Citations.
AND that this Synod may prevent all grievances, which may fall upon the people
by Citations into Ecclesiastical Courts, upon pretense only of the breach of
Law, without either P^esentment, or any other just ground. This present Synod
decrees, That for all times to come no such Citation, grounded only as
aforesaid, shall issue out of any Ecclesiastical Court, except the said
Citation be sent forth under the hand and Seal of the Chancellor, Commissarie,
Archdeacon, or other competent J^dge of the said Court, within thirty days
after the fault committed; and return thereof to be m^de the next, or second
Court day after the Citation served at the farthest; and that the party so
cited, unl^sse he be convinced by two witnesses, shall, upon the denial of the
fact upon Oath, be forthwith freely dismissed without any payment of fees;
Provided that this Decree ex^e^d not to any g^ievous crime, as Schism,
Incontinencie, misbehaviour in the Church in time of Divine Service, obstinate
inconformitie, or the like.

WE of Our Princely inclination and Royal care for the maintenance of the
present Estate and government of the Church of England by the Laws of this Our
Realm now settled and established, having diligently, with great contentment
and comfort read and considered of all these their said Canons, Orders,
Ordinances and Constitutions agreed upon, as is before expressed: And finding
the same such as We are persuaded will be very profitable, not only to Our
Clergy, but to the whole Church of this Our Kingdom, and to all the true
members of it (if they be well observed;) Have therefore for Us, Our Heirs,
and lawful Successors, of Our especial grace, certain knowledge, and mere
motion, given, and by these presents do give Our Royal Assent, according to
the form of the said Statute or Act of Parliament aforesaid, to all and every
of the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Constitutions, and to all and every
thing in them contained, as they are before written. And furthermore, We do not
only by Our said Prerogative Royal, and supreme Authority in Causes
Ecclesiastical, ratify, confirm, and establish, by these Our Letters
Patents, the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Constitutions, and all and
every thing in them contained, as is aforesaid, but do likewise propound,
publish, and straightly injoyne and command by Our said Authority, and by these
Our Letters Patents, the same to be diligently observed, executed, and equally
kept by all Our loving Subjects of this Our Kingdom, both within the Provinces
of Canterbury and York, in all points wherein they do or may concern ^very or
any of them according to this Our will and pleasure hereby signified and
expressed. And that likewise for the better observation of them, every
Minister, by what ^ame or title soever he be called, shall in the Parish Church
or Chapel where he has charge, read all the said-Canons, Orders, Ordinances
and Constitutions, at all such times, and in such manner as is prescribed in
the said Canons, or any of them: The Book of the said Canons to be provided at
the charge of the Parish, betwixt this and the Feast of S. Michael the
Archangell next ensuing, straightly charging and commanding all Archbishops,
Bishops, and all other that exercise any Ecclesiastical jurisdiction within
this Realm, every man in his place to see and procure (so much as in them
lies) all and every of the ^ame Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Constitutions
to be in all points duly observed, not sparing to execute the penalties in them
severally mentioned, upon any that shall wittingly or wilfully break or neglect
to observe the same; as they tender the honor of God, the peace of the Church,
the tranquillity of the Kingdom, and their duties and service to Us their King
and Sovereigne. In witness whereof We have caused these Our Letters to be made
Patents: Witness Our Self at Westminster, the thirtieth day of June, in the
sixteenth year of Our Reign.
