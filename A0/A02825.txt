and we know that his testimonye is true. Joan.xxi.

A small preface unto the Christen reader.
IN the first part or volume of this work (which contains the first.x
chapters) are al these godly matters of sai^ Ioha^s reuelacyo^ in course
co^prehe^ded. First of all is the high legacye and massage of the said Saint
Johan unto the.vij. congregacions of Asia in the first chaptre mencyoned.
Wherein they are also unto.vij. golden ca^delstickes compared and their peackers
unto.vij. shynynge sterres in the right hand of Christ

In the second and third chaptres are the said.vij. co^gregatio^s seuerallye
yche one by it self descrybed and warned / to the universal premonyshemen^ of
the whole christen church in the.vii. parts or clymates of the world. Mark
those.iij. chapters dylyge^tlye / and ye shall perceive that the true christen
church is alone governed by the preaching of Gods word / an only office of
Christ commanded / and not by dead Ceremonies commanded by the pope / of whom
the^ is no specyalte.

Co^sydre how those preachers throughout all this book / are compared unto
star^es and angels / their congregacyons called the right spouse of Christ. The
other be assembled unto most filthye locustes / breadynge of the smoke of the
pytte bottomless / unto hateful birds / foul spretes and deuyls / their
church called the proud Synagoge of Satan and the most execrable whore of
Babylon.

In the.iiij. chaptre is heaven made open and the secrets thereof manyfested
unto the christen beleuer / whom Johan also represents this whole book over.
For not only are the mysteryes thereof in the universal church performed /
but also in the particular churches of nacyons / and in the pryuate co^scye^ces
o^ me^.

In the.v.vi. and.vij. chaptres / the lamb Christ opens the.vij. seals of
the book of the most hydden mysteryes of God / for the.vij. ages of the
christian church. In the me^ne season are the true servants of God sealed
unto salvation / solaced in their trobles / and releued in their sorrow / not
withstanding the great violence of the truths adversaries

In the.viij. and.ix. chaptres / the.vij. angels blow their trompettes.
Sygnyfyenge the preachers to show forth their massages appointed of God for
the.vij. ages of the church / many wonderful plages following in the people
for their vnbeleues sake / they obstinatlye resistinge yt or else vntha^kefully
receyuinge it.

In the.x. chaptre comes the mighty Angel from heaven with a book in his
hand all open / and Johan deuowreth the same. Which betokens the ernest
preachers of this lattre age of the church / wherein the true servants of God
shall gredelye receive and also dygest the scripturs. Take this for a brefe
sum of all that is spoken in the other volume / the resydue shall follow here
after in course.

In the mergende of that first part or volume / put I many allegacyons both of
the scripturs and doctors. And there unto was I first provoked by this saying
of Saint Hierome in a serten Epistle of his ad paulinum monachum. The Apocalypse
of saint Ioha^ (says he) has so many mysteries as it has words / or for
every word a mysterye whether ye will.

I minded also thereby / my labors to ease the readers for search of the places
/ and to sygnyfye unto them that I ded nothing therein without autoryte. And
undoubtedly the gatherynge of those places was so laboryouse unto me / as the
making of the commentarye / which nevertheless I thought well bestowed for
the confort of my brethren.

But.ij. cruel enemies have my just labors had in that behalf / of whom the
one have the^ falsified / the other blasphemed. Which has caused me to leave
them out in all that here follows. The printers are the first / whose headye
have / negligence / and covetousness commonly corrupts all books. These have
both dysplaced them and also changed their no^bers to the truths derogacyo^ /
what though they had at their hands.i^. learned correctours which took all
pains possible to preserve them.

The other is Momus or Zoilus / yea / rather one which plays both parts
under the clock of a christyane. This cruel carper and malycyouse quareller
leaves no man's work unrebuked / mynistre it never so much godliness. But
like as rust / mothes / maggottes / ca^kers / caterpyllers / with other vile
vermyne corrupts all that is to the use of man / so does this enemy / to
destroy both name and work / only for the auaunceme^t of his own preciouse
person.

His workinge toles are soche unsavory sophysmes / problemes / clenches /
corolaryes / quydditees / subtiltees / second inte^cyons / intrinsecall moodes
/ with other prodigiouse sorceryes / whom he sumtyme sucked out of his mothers
breasts the university. These has he not yet all / as unsavory morsels
euometed for Christ / distyninge rather with Aristotle than with paul in his
daily disputacions.

Of this ryall Rabiys peter judged a fool / and Johan an unlearned Idiote. Yet
shall his reader find small lerninge at his hand / unless he take an heap
of barbarouse terms and unsown together sentences for matters of excellent
learning. But surely Johan will one day come from Ephesus to visyte this
proud Diotrephes and show him of his arrogant bragges to his displeasure /
unless he leave of in time. All Aristotle's provision shall not help him.

Satan upon the pynnacle of the temple never bestowed his alleged scripture
more peruerselye / than this Momus interpreted serten of my allegacyo^s / nor
yet farther from their right understanding* But I forgive it him with this
fore warning for this time / though it be not the first lewd point that he
has played / in case he so leave his quarellynge. My second allegacyo^ upon
the preface.i. Corin. vi. is not set there to auctoryse the Apocalypse / as he
most falsely and all contrary to my meaning has interpreted i^ / but
affermeth that the christen beleuers are christ's members / which ought of
necessyte by the holy ghostes appointment to hear and to read the words of
the said book. For I know that the Epistle unto the Corinthyanes was written
of Paul.x. years at the least before Saint Iohans Apocalypse. No less is he
tha^ a false prophet that resists Jeremy rebukynge Babylon for her
wickedness.

To much it were to answer his other quarellynges / and to tedyouse unto the
christen readers / and therefore I pass them over / least I should be to
plentuouse in answeringe a fool according to his folyshnesse. Thus by these
cruel ha^delinges of these.ij. ungracious enemies / have I just occasyon to
leave out the allegacyons in the margende / observing this wh^lsom counsel of
Christ concerning soche as they be.

Give not that is holy unto dogs / nor yet that is precyouse unto swyne. For
the one of his churlyshe nature teareth and deuoureth / the other like a swyne
treads it under his filthy feate. The grace of our lord Jesus Christ be
with the evermore (good christen reader) and with all the^ that seaketh of the
scrypturs the saving health in them contained without quarellynge.

Amen.

heaue^lye Reuelacyon of Saint Johan the Evangelist / and ce.
Compyled by Johan Bale.
The.xi. Chaptre.
UNto Johan was delivered after that he had thus deuowred the book / a read /
not unlike to the metewande of.vi. cubits long and a spa^ne / which was given
unto Ezechiel / nor very far different from the measurynge line in Zachary.
And what is this else? but that the administracion of Gods heaue^lye verite is
secretlye of him committed unto them which has before received yt / and in
faith digested it / that they should there with ryghtlye measure / discern /
and judge all things. No^ other is yt to prophecye again in this sixth age /
but thus to mete the temple / the altar / and the worshippers therein / and to
prove them in length / bredeth / heyth / and depeth.

ANd than was given me a reed. 2. like unto a rod. 3. and yt was said unto
me. Arise. 4. and meet the temple of God. 5. and the altar. 6. and them that
worship therein. 7. And the quere / which is within the temple / cast out. 8.
and meet it not. 9. for it is given unto the gentiles. 10: And the holy cite
shall they tread under foot xlij. months

1 And there was given me (says saint Johan) a read. Both received I the
wisdom of God and also a mouth to utter yt. So that my tongue became the pen
of a redye writer. For so much as I abhorred iniquite / the lord anointed me
in wardlye with the oil of gladness / and gave me stomach to utter his word.

2 The read which God delivered me / was like unto a rod. For his word is
the rod of right order / And the scepture of his kingedome. With this rod
spredde he out the heavens / and laid forth the first fou^dacyon of the
earth. This rod of his power has the lord now graciouslye sent us out of
Syon by men having his special grace as by Johan / ^o have dominyo^ here in
the midst of his enemies.

3 For unto Johan yt was said for this age. Arise / from vain stodye / from
cares of the body / from consideracion of earthlye causes.

4 And mete the holy temple of God / which is his congregation or church:
Prove all beleues whether they be right or no. Examyne their works / whether
they spring of Gods commau^deme^ts or of men's tradicions. And in so doing
try by the scripturs the ^orne from the chafe Mark out the people of God from
the synagoge of satan / and delay not to norryshe them with the sweet fruits
of the sprete.

5 Measure the altar also / which is Jesus Christ / upon who^ the full
sacrefice of redemptyon was offered. For many false cristes are a broad in the
world / to seduce the people. The pope boasts him self for gods own vicar /
Mahomete calls him self the great prophet of the lord. And both they to
subdewe the gospel has set up new laws. The pope his detestable decrees /
and Mahomete his abominable alchorane. Both they have wrought soche wonders
and soche signs in superstycion / as might deduce into error (if God were
not merciful) the very elect persons. The monks says that Christ is in the
desert / the prestes says he is in the box / but admonish my people / that in
no case they believe yt. The chanons says he is here / the fryres says he is
there / but counsel my flock that they go not forth. For God dwells in
nothing that is made with hand. In the faithful heart is Christ only found.
There remains he. That is his dwelling place.

6 Therefore now last of all / measure them also that worshipp in the temple.
Considre them only to be his people / which seek him in sprete and in veryte /
and that worship not in outward shadows / nor in the elements of this
world / nor yet with obseruacyo^ of days and times. They are not his sons /
that for the ^euen of the Pharisees which is the doctrine of hypocrites /
forsakes the bread of children which is his lyuinge word. They are not his
la^bes but vile gottes / that rather atte^deth to the voice of strangers /
tha^ to the true sheparde Christ.

7 And therefore the quere which is within the temple / cast out. The prelates /
prestes / and religiouse / which are not of the common sort / seclude from
Christ / from his church / and from the company of true worshippers. Throw
forth the bond woman and her son / the Rome church with her children / and
Mahomete with his rabble. For the bond shall not inherete with the fre.

8 Measure not out that chaunsell of charmers / that college of Galaa^s
brethren / those marked Madianytes and cursed Ismaelytes. Allow them not by
the scripturs / commend not their cou^terfet ryghtousnesse. Admyt the^ not for
the me^bres of Christ / but judge them to be the sinagoge of Satan. And spear
the^ out of the kingedome of God / with the keye of David. For they are those
swine that tread perles under their fete and those cruel dogs that turn
again to deuowre me^ne. Meddle not with that quere / have not to do with that
wicked generation.

9 For it is given unto the gentiles. Wholly are those Antichrists addict to
the supersticiouse rytes of the heythe^ in their sacrifices / their ceremonies
/ their obseruatio^s / their holy days / their vygils / fastinges ^ praynges /
knelinges / and all other vsages / contrary to the admonyshement of Christ.
That they should in no wise enter into the ways of the gentiles. Wherefore God
has detested the^ with his own mouth / and clean given the^ over unto their
own filthy lusts. Now reygne they al in their own wisdom / thinking
evermore their own fleshlye fantasies best: wholly they are become Gentiles.

10* And the holy cite (of whom gloryouse things are spoken) they shall
tread under foot the space of.xlij. months. Not the earthlye Jerusalem is
this cite / builded of men / and made holy by the out ward obseruacions and
ceremonies of the jews as many expositours has fa^tasyed. For of that (like
as Christ prophesied) is not left one stone standinge upon an other. But this
cite is the sure buyldinge of God / grounded upon the strong fou^dacion of the
Apostles and Prophets / even upon the hard rock stone Jesus Christ. This is
the plesaunt possession / the wholesome howsholde / the sure hold / and the
dylectable vyneyarde of the lord of hosts. This is the living generacyon of
them which fears / loves / and seeks their lord God in faith sprete and
veryte / and not in outward shadows. These are the children of promise / the
true of spring of Abraham / the chosen house of Israel / and the kyngedome of
the holy ghost. Pure / clean / and holy has Christ made this cite / by no^
other thing but the only shedinge of his preciouse blood.

11 This cite tread they under foot / that keeps down the treuthe of the
gospel / that persecuteth and sleeth gods people for it / that defeateth his
word for their own tradicyons / that brings in the Iewishe ceremonies / the
gentyles supersticyons / paganes customs and heythen vsages / yokynge men
with importable burdenes of false worshyppinges for their own filthy lucre
and advantage. Not withsta^dynge thus must they do still by the sufferaunce of
God / till the.xlij. months be finyshed / which is not else but the time / the
times / and the half time / or the thowsande / two ho^dreth / and lx. days /
in that God shall shorten the time for his chosens sake. Thus after saint ^an^e
also before the lords coming / there must be a departing. The quere or
chaunsel must be cast out / tha^ the manne of sin / the son of perdicyon /
and the aduersarye exalting him self above God / may be known in his own
colors. It may not be motte^ / or allowed by Gods word / but rejected as
that plant which the heavenly father has not planted / that the mysterye of
inyquite may be uttered and perceived of the^ which shall be saved. It must be
given to the gentiles / or addict to their supersticyons / with all lyenge
power / signs / and wonders / in all deceyuable doctrine / by the subtle
workinge of Satan. They must also be permitted to do all mischef in
vnryghtousnesse / upon the cytezeus of God / till he utterly consume the^ with
the mighty breathe of his mouth.

The text.
1 And I will give power / 2. unto my two witnesses. 3. and they shall
prophecye a thousand / two hundred and threscore days. 4. clothed in sack
clothe 5 These are two olyue tr^es 6. and two candelstyckes. 7. sta^dynge
before the God of the earth.

The Paraphrase.
1 And I will give power says the lord unto my two faithful witnesses / and
they shall prophecy a thousand two ho^dreth and.lx. days / against those
enemies to the confort of my people. So that though my cite by trodden down by
their cruel laws of persecution to death / yet shall yt not be forsaken. And
though my people be ouerloaded with their heythen superstycyons and blasphemouse
worshippinges / yet shall they not be lost nor left all without socoure.

2 They shall have my.ii. witnesses with them to solace the^ in their trobles /
and to confort the^ in there cares. Both Moses and Christ / both the law and
the gospel / both the prophets and the apostles shall stand upon their side
and be upon there part: yea / for so much time as there enemies shall vex the^
/ and for so much space as there adversaries shall troble the^ Even a thowsande
two hundred and.lx. days / which makes three year and an half / and is more
then the.xlii. months by four score days and four. Which signifies that
the enemies shall not ever more keep down his word / but their days shall be
shortened for his electes sake. The scole doctors with their sophistry has
fantasied the said two witnesses to be Enoch and Helias / and that they should
come then from paradyse terrestre for the same puprose / because that Enoch was
taken away of God / and Helias was carried hence in a fyery charet / neither
understanding what paradyse is / nor yet knowing what yt is to be taken from
hence. Paradyse is the sweet rest of God appointed unto the^ that depart hence
in faith. The peculiar tra^slatio^s of Enoch and Helias were not only for a
confirmacyon or strengthenynge of the faith of the fathers for their times /
but also that they should be figurs of Cristes ascencion. And what godly wise
man can give more to the figure than to the veryte: More were not they
preuileged from death tha^ was Christ / though God would not then have yt so
openly known / to declare his wonderful power. Unlyke is it that God should call
witnesses from the dead not promisinge yt by his word / having power also
from stones to raise up Abraham's children / and to give the sprete of Helias to
whom he pleases / like as he ded to Johan Baptist / and as he does now to
many other more in our age / as all the world may se and hear. These
witnesses are two / for so much as the trewthe of the lord in the mowthe of
two or three godly persons ought to stand.

3 These two witnesses or faithful procestours of the before said two
testamentes / has continewed with the people of God sens the death of Steue^ /
for the more part secretlye and unknown to the world. But now they are come a
broad by the appointment of God to the utter confusion of the great aduersarye
and manne of sin as Paul does call him. And unto them in this sixth age of
the church the lord has given the great power of his living word / or the
sprete of his inuincyble veryte in much more ample wise then before time / for
the abatement of the said enemies or synagoge of perdycyon.

4 Clothed they shall be in sack clothe (says the lord) No pomp shall apere
in their aparell / no glory of the world in their behauer. Neither shall they
be accompanied with a guard of ruffelinge rutters. Neither shall they with Annas
and Caiphas sit upon life and death. Neither shall they bless in the street
with myter / cross / and cope. Neither claim the hyger seats in side gowns
shaven crowns / and typpettes. Neither shall their be sack fryres nor
franciscanes / monks / chanons / nor hipocrites. They shall not disfigure them
selves to seem religiouse / nor say long prayers to apere holy / but in a
sober conversation avoiding superstuite / they shall co^sta^tlye witness the
truth of God to the universal world / to his glory and their edification.
For sack clothe in the scripturs is a sign of sobryete / sadness / and
temperau^ce / as in helias and Johan Baptist.

5 These witnesses are two sweet olyue trees / shedynge forth the fatness of
the scripturs / and dulcet sauer of the sprete. God has so blessed them / that
their lips are full of grace. He has anointed the^ with the oil of
gladness above their fellawes / of myrre / bawme / and aloes they dilectably
smelle. Non other things utter they but his infallible veritees.

6 They are also two shynynge candelstickes / setting forth the light / or
clerelye opening the hydde^ mysteries of the scripturs / to the confort of the
ge^tyles and glory of the Israelites. They are not the light it self but only
instruments ordained to bear witness of the light. For there is but one light
for all. Only a^e they the vessels of eleccion (as was paul / to carrye that
light the world over.

They stand in the presence of the God of the earth / or the lord of all /
as men of most high acceptacyon before him / rebye to do his will and to
fulfill his conmandeme^t and pleasure / having the oil of his sprete and the
light of his eternal veryte.

1 And if any manne will hurt them. 2. Fire shall proceed out of their
mouths. 3. and consume their enemies. 4. And if any man will hurt them /
this wise must he be killed. 5. These have power to shut heaven. 6. that it
rain not in the days of their prophecyenge. 7. and have power over waters to
turn them to blood. 8. and to smite the earth. 9. with all manner plages / as
often as they will.

The Paraphrase.
i If any manne will attempt to do them s^athe / or presumptuouslye seeks by
craf^ye colou^s / subtle reasons / and deceytfull arguments / upon dangers /
doubts / doctor^ / old customs / and auctoryte of fathers to hyndre their
office / blemyshe their message / and darken their lyght^ such fire shall
proceed out of their mouths as shall consume their enemies.

2 The eternal word of the lord that they shall declare (which is the
consuminge fire) shall utterly destroy the^. So that nothing shall be seane
of that they were before. Neither cut show nor cord / coule nor graye cote /
bote nor black whode / rother nor scaplar / myter nor croser / sandale nor
frocke / shaven crown nor anointing. For all these are their enemies.

3 Consumed are they to there salvation that with Matthew become of Publycanes
true Apostles / and with Paul of ferce persecuters charitable teachers.
Contrary wise are they consumed to their damnacyon / which being ouercomen by
the manifest veryte / wylfullye persist in their deuyllyshe errors with
Antiochus and Pharao / with the Scribes and Pharisees.

4 For yt follows. And if any manne will hurt them / this wise must he be
killed. Either must he be mortified from the old Adam / and changed into a
new man in Christ / or else by the said word must he both be judged and
condemned for the utter aduersarye of God / with satan his ancient captain.
So must he be killed. And no death will be found like unto that death come
they ones to the feeling of yt / though they account yt now very light.

5 For these witnesses have power a^ had Helias / to shutt up heaven / that yt
rain not in the days of their prophecienge / but yet non other wise tha^ by
the before said word. For the word of God is the very keye of David / which
opens the kyngedome of God to the^ that faythfullye believes / and that
speareth yt up also from the^ which dwells in unfaithfulness. For it is said
/ in the days of their prophecyenge. This power therefore is of the word / and
not of the men. The word speareth and opens / losoneth and byndeth /
saves and da^pneth. He that believes (says Crist) shall be saved / he that
believes not is judged alredye. No moyster of grace nor godly wisdom can light
where sturdye frowardenesse is roted. The days of their prophecyenge in figure
is non other than the aforesaid time / times / and half time / or the three
years and.vi. months of Helyas.

6 In those days shall it not rain upon the wicked / they shall have no grace
to receive the veryte. In parables and figurs shall that be hydden from the^ /
that shall be evident ynowe unto the faithful. With ears shall they hear and
not understand / with eyes shall they se and not discerue. So blind will
their hearts be. For soche spoke the prophets in fygurs / Christ in parables /
and the Apostles in mysteries. The open truth of this reuelacion shall not the
wicked perceive / till they taste the plages thereof. Soche is the nature of Gods
wisdom / that thowgh it be not in gloriouse words / fine paputed terms / nor
in perswasible reasons of man's wit / but in plain simple speaking / yet
can it not be known of the worldly wise. The sweet dew thereof will not be
received of the^ / in the aforesaid days of prophecy / but he that is blind
shall be blind still.

7 These witnesses have also power over waters / to turn them into blood.
When they interpret and syncerely declare the pure berites of God / which are
those wholesome waters that restrayneth the da^pnable dryness of the soul /
that refreshes the conscience / and cleanses the heart of the sinner / they
can not chose but ernestlye condemn the perverse judgments / the couetouse
laws / and hypocritishe works of the ungodly. And then is all unclean unto
them / the^ is all bloodye. The gospel which was a stomblynge stone to the
Jews / and mad folyshenesse unto the gentyles / is also now unto them nowrye
new lerninge / sediciouse doctrine / and abominable he resye. Yea / and they
judge them worthy to be burned that does teach it. Thus is it abhorred of
them that shall perish and nevertheless to the^ that believe / it is the power
of God unto salvation.

8 Fynallye they have power to smite the earth with all manner of plages / as
often as they will. Uerye ca^the are they that regard not Gods truth / as the
lord said unto Ada^ after his offense. Earth thu art / and unto earth shall
thu return. Nothing they esteem / but that which is earthlye. Nothing they
desire / but that is carnal. The froward creature will in no case know that
is of the sprete. The light is hateful unto sore eyes Uerr peynefull is bread
to the mouth that is not whole. A great mote was Crist to the Jews / as his
true preachers are unto the blind world yet to this day. For they smite the
earth.

9 They towche their living / they rebuke their falshede / they conde^pne
their wickedness. They reprove them of sin / of ryghtousnesse and of
judgment. They force not to tell the^ of there unfaithfulness / frawde / and
hypocrisye / of their philosophers / prelates / and relygyouse. No greatter
^lage is yt to the ungodly than to hear of their evil doings. No greater
pain / nor yet greatter ponnyshme^t / than to have their fawtes opened / and
their clonynge colors condemned. That fretteth the^ at the very heart. Death
must be sought out for soche preachers. No wonder is yt though this be here
written for this age of the church. For never were more ernest witnesses then
are now / and more are like here after to follow / till the ma^ne of sin be
fullye known / and his kyngedome clerelye overthrown.

come them. 5. And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great cite. 7.
which spirytuallye is called Sodom and Egypt. 8. where our lord is crucyfyed.

The Paraphrase.
1 And when they have ones fynyshed their testimonye (says the lord) the
beast that came out of the bottomless pytte / shall make war against them. No
sooner shall the witnesses of Gods veryte in allages be taken from the world /
than he has prefixed. After no^ other sort shall they be sent hence / than he
has appointed by his eternal decre. Ioha^ baptist was not enprysoned nor
beheaded / till he had done his office. Christ was not taken / condemned / and
crucyfyed till his hour was come. Paul was not putt unto death / till he had
fulfilled his course.

2 The beast of the bottomless pytte is the cruel / craftye / and cursed
generation of Antychrist / the pope with his bishops / prelates / prestes /
and relygyouse in Europa / Mahomete with his dettynge dowsepers in Africa /
and so forth in Asia and India / all beastlye / carnal / and wicked in their
doings.

3 These makes war against Gods witnesses / when they hate them / curse them
/ blaspheme them / and persecute the^. When they withstand them with their
crafts / impugn them with their lies / and vex them with their
deuyllyshnesse / as necessary it is they should do. For if they have trobled
the head / they must be^e also the members. If the howsholder be called
Beelzebub / the howsholde must suffer the same. No better is the servant than
his lord / nor the massenger than he that sent him.

4 They shall also overcome them / not with the scripturs / but with their
beggerlye customs / constitucions / laws / decrees and tradicyons. They shall
scourge them or dysgrade them in their synagoges. They shall deliver them up to
justices / debitees / and rewlers / making them their bothers and slaves / so
washinge their own holy hands from the shedynge of innocents blood.

5 They shall kylle the^ also by their counsel / to fulfill the measure of
their fathers / that all ryghtuouse blood may light upon them which has been
shed upon earth. Yet shall they not hurt their sowles / but through faith
they shall have victory both over them and the devil.

6 And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great cite. In this world
shall their carkases remain / where as they have rewle and domynyon. Here
shall they be judged and condemned. At their pleasure shall it be to ha^ge
the^ / head them / or burn them. And thowgh they lay no hands upon them for
soylynge their consecrate fyngars / yet must it be done by their ghostlye
cownsel / and ordered also after their spyrituall appointment. Non other is it
to lie in the streets of their great cite / than after ^oche laws as they
have practysed took brought unto death.

7 For spiritually is their cite called. A gloryouse name usurp they as though
they were no^ of the world. They will be called the holy church / good
ghostlye fathers / godly dyuines / and spiritual me^ne / not co^siderynge of
what sprete they are spiritual. They are those into who^ the unclean sprete
has entered with.vij. other spretes worse than him self. With the sprete of
falshede / the sprete of fylthynesse / the sprete of lies / the sprete of
wytchecrafte / the sprete of error / the sprete of blindness / and the
sprete of cruelte. And of these only with soche like are they spyrituall / and
of no godly sprete as their fruits declares. And therefore the sprete of god
does judge here this great cite not to be called Jerusalem / but stinkinge
Sodom / and most miserable Egypt / the prophecyes and other scripturs
agreynge to the same. For look what fylthynesse and abhomynacion was in Sodom
/ what Idolatrye and deuylyshnesse was in Egypt / the same is now reygnynge in
this painted spyritualte / and is accounted there great holiness.

8 Among this consecrate multitude / or smered sort is Christ yet crucyfied /
as he was among the Jews which knew him not / and yet boasted the^ selves
outwardlye for the peculiar chosen people of God. Not only is Christ among
the^ persecuted / scourged / ponnyshed / and put unto death in his members /
but also he is proved of them an vnsufficyent Sauer without their daily
doings. Their masses must be satysfactory sacrifices / profytinge both the
quick and the dead. And that must men believe under pain of death and
dampnacyon. Thus crucyfye they Christ again / and make a mock of him as
wytnessed Paul / and yet do they call him their lord / not unlike to the
tormentours / which crowned him with thorn / and saluted him with Aue rex
Iudeorum.

The Paraphrase.
1 And as they lie thus dead in the streets / or are contempned as heretykes /
and despised as wicked doars / some of the people perverted by these enemies /
some of the kynredes or sects of dyuysion / some of the tongues or blasphemouse
bablers / and some of the nacyons of al wicked workers shall behold their
bodies iij. days and an half.

2 They shall for all ages abhor them / hate the^ / reuyle them / and
spyghtfullye report them. In there chronicles shall they write them for seducers
of the people / and in their stories regestre them for dampnable heretykes: For
the.iij. days and an half dyuided into.vij. halues betokens the.vii. ages of
the church wherein they have and shall still both persecute and blaspheme.

3 And these wicked sorts of people / kynredes tongues / and nacyons / or of
false justices / prestes / lawers / and relygyouse shall not suffer their
bodies to be put in graves. But be these witnesses ones judged heretykes by
the clergy / and so condemned by the layte / either shall their bodies be
resolved in to ashes by fire / or else consumed by the fowls of the air.
Seldom shall ye se a known heretyke buried among them / but most commonly
burned. Examples of this has been ^a^elye seane here in England by Thomas
hyttoon / Thomas bylueye Johan frith / George baynham / William tindale / Johan
lambert / Robert barnes / Wylliam Hyerome / Thomas garade / Richard spenser /
and in Partrick hamilton of Scotland / with many other more. And long before
our time in sir Johan old castle the lord Cobha^, sir Roger ac^on knight /
sir Reynolde pecock bishop of chychester Master Ioha^ Ayshton / sir Willyam
thorpe / sir Willyam ^awtre / sir Richard with / sir Johan balle / sir Willyam
tayloure / and sir willyam whyght prestes / with diverse other. The body of
Formosus was first taken up by Steven the.vi. Bishopp of Rome and disgraded.
After was yt beheaded / mangled / and thrown into the flood of Tyber by
Sergius the third. Saint Herman after.xx. years from his buryall was taken up
and burned at Ferraria in Italy by Boneface the ryhht. The bones of Master
Johan wycclef were taken up and burned also the.xl: year after his death / as
waldene witnesses to his book de Sacramentalibus ti.ix. Capi.lxxxix. So was of
late years in worcestre dyocese the body of master William Tracye esquire /
and in London the body of Richard honne merchande taylour. Moreover Johan
colet deane of Paul's in london also / was not far from the same for reading
of Paul's Epistles by his life / had not other wayghtye matters been in the
way. Soche heretykes shall not rest in their cite / they shall not be buried
among them. They shall not be shryued / canonysed / nor allowed for Saints /
for they builded no monasteries / they set up no chau^teryes / they subdewed
no Princes / nor yet dyed for the lybertees of holy church. They s^ode not in
defense that prestes doing Idolatrye / theft / murder / wytche craft /
whoredom / buggerye / with other abhominacyons should remain vnponnyshed. But
rather to the contrary and that they should worshypp but one God / live by
their labors / take w^^es of their own / and teach nothing but Gods laws.

4 And they that dw^ll upon the earth (says the lord (or have their felycite
herewith the rich glotton / shall rejoice over them and be glad.

5 They shall clappe their hands wha^ these godly witnesses be brought out of
the way They shall common / ryote / and bancket / having among themselves
Joy without measure that the heretykes be gone / so hateful is the light to
their eyes / and the veryte to their wicked hearts.

6 And they shall send gifts or presents one to an other for gladness / as
for example. My lord bishop has had a sum of many of the prestes for
doing his part so well. My lord abbote and master doctor have had phesondes /
plouers and partriches pigges / gese / and capo^s / for dysparynge / their
matters so va^eauntlye* Master person has been commended for scolding / and
ser saunde^ smelle smock our perryshe priest for bearing false witness.
Master fryre has had a treu^all and father limit our a bushel of ma^^ or a
che^^ for playnge the knaves also. And hardelye my lord chief justice has not
been without his reward / no^ yet master Chau^celloure / neither master
Scrybe. What made Thomas More for his time with so prodigiouse ^y^an^^e to
persecute the truth and seus / Godfathe of Norwiche / wharto^ of Gongaye (...)
and Baker of k^te / with soche other lyke^ but auri sacra fames / as (...) both
call it. Thus do they (...) triu^phe wha^ they have wrought my (...) and much
it deliteth the^ wha^ they been (...) ungodly things.

7 For (...) prophets (says the lord) vexed them that dwell on the earth* A
great troble it is to the^ to have their faw^es seane / a sore vexacion to have
their crafts known / and an exceeding displeasure to be put from their
plesaunt Euphrates by the preaching of soche busye heretics. Much was Herod
offended with Johan / the bishops with cri^t / the prelates and religiouse
with Paul / and a sore grefe it was to their hearts / when they rebuked their
vices.

The Paraphrase.
1 And after three days and an half (says Saint Johan / ded the sprete of
life by the power of God enter in to them. In the mids of their Joy and
triumph when they think them selves well quyeted / the heretykes thus taken a
way / an other storm falls upon the^ much worse than the other. Many more
aryseth out of their ashes to their confusion and to the chosens confort. And
the same witnesses they are again / geuynge the same testymonye / though they
be not the same persons.

2 The same living sprete have they / confessinge the same veryte / that had
the other. No long time can Christ's congregation be without faithful testes
/ he promysinge to be with them to the end of the world.

3 These witnesses stood up / upon their fete. In the time full past is this
spoken for the certe^te of the thing / though much of it be to come. For so
certain is it / as it were all fynyshed. An ernest stomach shall they have / and
with much boldness shall they speak. The ryghtouse shall stand up (says
the book of wisdom) in great feruentnesse of sprete / against them that has
extremelye handled them / and taken away their labors / persecuted them / and
blemyshed their doctrine.

4. And great fear came upon the^ which saw them. When the Antichrystes se
they can not prevail / much are they inwardlye anguyshed / vexed / and
tormented. Then doubt they their fall / tha^ fear they their utter
destruction. They trymble and quake wha^ they se their laws will no longar
stand / nor their insurreccions no longar help them / lokinge for a terrible
day. With horrible fear shall they wonder (says the aforesaid book of
wisdom* at the coming of the sudden health / gronynge for sorrow / and
mourning for very anguyshe of mind / and saying within them selves. These be
they whom we sometime had in deuysion. Unwisely / we thought their lives to be
madness / and their ends to be without honor. And now they are rekened
among the children of God / and their portion is among the Saints. Therefore
have we erred from the way of truth / and the light of ryghtousnesse has not
shyned unto us. We have weryed owr selves / in the paths of wickedness but
the way of the lyuinge lord have we not known.

5 And they hard a great voice from heaven / saying unto them. Come up hither.
The Antichrists shall hear this noise / they shall know the^ to be in the
fauer of God / and great heaviness it shall be unto the^. For this voice is
the fre eleccyon of God according unto grace and not after manes deseruynge.
And it conmeth from heaven as does all other good gifts / from the father of
light. It calls up them that before walked sumwhat after the flesh / and
durst not for fear of po^nyshme^t witness the veryte. It comma^deth them to
arise unto God / to be more perfyght / more spyrytuall / more godly / and to
have their conversation in heaven. They atte^de unto the voice / they obey yt
/ and do after yt. For yt follows.

6 And they ascended up into heaven in a cloud. By the power of God they are
taken up. From worldly affectes are they changed to the pure love of God / and
from carnal prudence to the wisdom of the sprete. In a cloud are they rapte.
Compassed are they with this flesh / the ill desires taken from them. Every
where resemble they Christ / and are daily better and better. They cease not
of their progress / no pain ca^ separate the^ from the love of Christ / till
they perfyghtly come to the sight of the God of Gods in the supercelestiall
Syon.

7 And their enemies save them. The Antichrists knows that they are gods
servants / the hypocrites perse^ueth they have heavenly knowledge Yea, many
times they so report them both in their words and writings. In many of them
Chronycles they ^f^rme / that Bererga^ius / Ioannes scotus the elder / Johan
wycleff / Johan husse / Hierome of Prage / Thomas thedonensis a whyght fryre of
Bryttayne burned in Rome / Hieronimus sauonarola a black fryre burned in
florence / and diverse other more were men of most excellent wits / of most
high learning / of most godly conuersacyo^ / of a most perfight life / fervent
/ constau^t / and immovable in in the time of their deaths. Bylney / Baynha^
Befeld / frithe / Tindale / Barnes and other / are yet reported (yea of
somewhich to this hew hates their opinions) to have dyed charetably and
godly. Yet believe they never the better / they come never the senner to God.
Their malice has so blinded the^ / and the cloud of ignorance so darkened
their knowledge / that still they blaspheme and most cruellye persecute.

8 And in the same hour (says saint Johan) there happened a great earthquake
A terrible co^tradiccion aryseth ever from the carnal Sinagoge / and from
among the earthlye minded hipocrites / wha^ the verite is ^awght / as it was
before time in Christ / and in his Apostles / specyallye in Paul / and now of
late days in many other poor preachers. Wha^ new witnesses arise / then
wax they more mad / fearce / and fell / then they were before. Then empreson
they / then ponnyshe they / then make they acts and command in pain of
death no more to speak in that name. Yet do they rather loose than win /
fall than rise / dysprofyght that profyght.

9 For the tenth part of their cite fell to the grownde. Their buyldinge upon
sand will in no case endure. That God has not planted must up by the roots.
Their holy whoryshe church / which is here called Sodom and Egypt) is
ruynouslye decayed. Their monasteries of monks / their howses of fryres /
their colleges of Idle prestes / with their nonnes / chanons / and chanteryes
in many places are down. Tithes are not as they have been / nor trentals /
nor other deuocions. Images are not sought / nor pardons in confession. The
people inclines to new learning / and goes from their old believe of holy
church. They that were monks / prestes / and fryres are now become gospel
teachers. Soche as before were dead / stands up now against them boldelye
This fallen part is here the tenth / for it is the lords by the law. It is
the same sheep that before was lost / and now is brought to Christ's fold.
These were called away from thens by the witnesses / the other stand yet
still / and are every day worse and worse.

10 In the earthquake were slain names of men to the nombre of seven
thowsande. An innumerable multitude has been sent out of the way by these
Antichrystes in their furye / but yet nothing have they slain but their
names. Only have they hurt their bodies / upon their sowles have they had no
power / no more than had Satan upon the soul of Job. Yet have not their names
peryshed before God / for of him are they written in the book of life. In no
case are the wicked of the godly here putt unto death / thowgh some do so
understand it / but rather of the wicked the godly. For they never retayle
their wrongs / but rather pray for their enemies.

11 And the remnaunt or resydewe were feared / says saint Johan and gave
glory to God of heaven. Of soche as were left in their earthquakes or terryble
persecucions / some remained in presone / Some were beggered / some were eryled
/ some fled / some lost their estimacion and fryndes / and yet gave praise
unto God.

12 In all their aduersitees they gloryfyed the name of their heavenly father
and Lord. Thus have we here what is done alredye / and what is yet to come
under this sixth trompet blowynge (where under we are now) which all / be
longs to the second woo.

13 And these things ones accomplyshed the second woo will be past. And then
look bye and bye for the third woo / for it will follow anon after without
fail / yea / so sone as this second woo is done.

14. In the latter age of all shall this third woo reygne / soche time as Gog
and Magog most extremelye shall rage. And the universal judgment shall
fynyshe that woo / as here after more euydentlye will opere. But consider that
these woes are to the infydels. The faithful fears them not / but receyuynge
the word in a pure heart they bring forth fruit in pacyent sufferaunce.

The.xii. Chapter.
NOw follows in order the.vi^ tro^pet blowing or the pure declaracion of
Christ's joyful tidinges for the last age of the church / under the.vij.
scale opening / with the wonders and maruels that their after enseweth.

The text.
1 And the seventh angel blewe 2 and there were made great voices in heaven. 3.
saying. The kyngedomes of this world are our lords and his Christ's. 4. and
he shall raygne for evermore. 5. And the.xxiiij. elders which sat before God
on their seats. 6. fell upon their faces / and worshypped God / saying. 7. We
give the thanks / lord God almyghtye / which art and wast / and art to come.
8. and For thu have received thy great might / and have raygned 9. And the
nacyons were angrye. 10. and thy wrath is to come. 11. and the time of the
dead that they should be judged. 12. and that thu should give reward unto
thy servants the prophets and saints. 13. and to the^ that fear thy name /
small and great. 14. and should destroy them which destroy the earth.

The Paraphrase.
1 And the seventh angel blewe (says Saint Johan). The seventh sort of
sincere preachers shall utter their message according to the will of God / they
shall declare his pleasure as he has appointed them. For thowgh it be spoken
here as past and done / for the certente of the thing / yet is it not
fulfilled in effect. The word of God was without beginning / and his promise
everlasting / yet is yt not all performed in his creaturs / but many things
are yet to come.

2 After this blast of the angel were made greet voices in heaven. Many (the
congregacyon or kyngedome of God / his Gospel ones purelye publyshed by the
preachers) shall spea^e godly things to the edyfycacyon of other. The simple
poor weakelynges / idyotes / and infantes shall vttre the hydden wisdom of
God to the confusion of the great wise men and sage senyours of this world.
Yea / the liones in the street / the out castes of the world / the forsaken
people / shall wonderfullye praise the lord.

3 And these shall be their saynges / wha^ they shall se the Antichrystes
confused and not able to speak again. The kyngedomes of this world / that
were ^ou^ time wicked / cruel / and unfaithful / are now become the lords
and his Christ's / of his only grace and goodness. Now fall they to the word
that before thought it folyshnesse. Now cleave they to the truth that sumtyme
ded abhor it. Now have they in hand the gospel / that before ded persecute
it as sidiciouse learning and heresye.

4 And in this congregacyon shall he reygne evermore. Continuallye is he with
them / that in faith retayneth his veryte. All this shall they vttre with no
small rejoice. For doubtless after the seventh seal opening / and the
gospel preaching / than a paceable time shall be / and fygured it is by the
half hour spoken of before. For it shall not continewe to the end. Long may
not Christ's church be vnpersecuted. But yet this peace for the time shall not
only be an inward peace in the conscience (as is always among the
faithful) but an outward / quiet also / or a season without persecucyon
abroad.

5 And the.xxiiij. elders (says saint Johan) or the greatt nombre of saints
departed (which sits before God on their seats / or rests in his sweet
peace / in soche graces of the sprete as he gave them by their life time / as
charity / stedefastnesse / love / joy / peace meekness / ryghtousnesse / and
soche other like) fell down flat upon their faces.

6 Most humblye have they ever submytted them selves / referrynge unto God the
father the benefyght of their creacyon / and unto Jesus Christ his son the
fre gift of their redempcyon. Yea / specyallye at this time / being under the
altar of God / and knowing by his mere goodness the nombre of their
brethren shortly to be fulfilled / and them selves with them to be at a
gloryouse lyberte / after their ghostlye sort they lawde him saying.

7 From the very depeth of owr spyrytuall hearts / we render unto the most
high thanks Lord God almightye / eternal father / Son / and holy Ghost /
which art one essencyall God / and werst without beginning / and shall be
without ending.

8 For thu have taken upon the thy great might. Now have thu showed thy
wonderful power. Ever have thu raygned among thy people / but never so
gracyouslye / so plentuouslye / and so gloryouslye for owr behoue.

9 The heythen evermore were angrye when thy t^wthe apered. Mad were the
wicked Antychrystes when thy glory shyned / and their pride demynished. They
fretted for anger / they swelled for wodenesse / yea they s^ewe thy servants
/ and burned up thy people.

10 But now is thy wrath toward the^. Now will thy a^ger break out / now
will thy ve^geau^ce apere. Now shall thy terrible judgment without mercy be
declared from heaven upon all ungodliness of those cruel enemies that
with-holde thy truth in vnryghtousnesse.

11 Now shortelye enseweth the time of the dead / wherein they shall be judged
some to joy some to heaviness / some to glory some to pain.

12 Now approaches the glad season wherein thu have appointed to reward the
true servants the prophets / and the faithful beleuers / made saints by
the only death of thy son / and all them that yet fears thy name / with
eternal felicyte.

13 Non wylt thu seclude from this thy lyberall goodness / for no weakness
nor pouerte. But so well the small as the great / the low as the high / the
poor as the rich / the sick as the whole / the unlearned as learned / shall
taste of thy inestimable clerenesse.

14 Only shall thu destroy them that destroyed the earth / compellynge both
it and all that therein is / not to serve the their heavenly creator / but
their own stynkynge desires / lusts / and corrupt affec^yons / thy glory not
ones esteemed nor regarded. Herin may we conjecture / that the seventh seal
ones opened / and the.vij. trompet blown / the last judgment day is not
far of. Blessed is he that watches for the lords coming.

1 And the temple of God was opened in heaven. 2. and there was seen in his
temple / the Arc of his Testamente. 3. And there followed lyghtenynges / and
voices / and thondringes / and earthquake. 4. and much hayle.

The Paraphrase.
1 And the temple of god (says Saint Johan) was opened in heaven. Euyde^t will
the godly and spiritual estate of the true Christen church seem in those
days / the gospel syncerelye preached. In faith shall men seek their
lyuinge father / and not in dead Images nor other corruptible things. In
sprete and veryte shall they worship him and not in dumme ceremonies nor
outward shadows. Speared is Gods temple / when his true worshyppynge is
hid. And opened it is again / when that is clerelye seane. Till Christ's
coming in the flesh nothing thereof apered. With the keye of David opened ke
the mysteries thereof. Wherbye throwgh faith the conuersacyon of many is now
and has been ever send in heaven.

2 This temple thus open / anon the Arc of Gods holy testament was seane
therein. Christ shows him self in his own colors / when the gospel is truly
received / which is that Arc / wherein all the riches of Gods couenauntes / and
the preciouse treasure of his promise is reposed / to man's behoue. And
specially those by whom we are reconcyled and saved. By him are we only
brought to Gods fauer again / and graciouslye redeemed. Yea / all the sort of
us have received of his habundaunt and ouerflowynge fullness. The sight of this
Arc in the temple is non other / than a clear knowledge of him in his
congregacyon. So often are his mysteries euydent / as this temple is opened. So
many times are they known as his word is truly tawght.

3 And no small fruit is to be thought to come thereof. For there followed
lyghteninges / voices / thonderinges / and earthquakes. Diverse respects has
the veryte of God / according to diverse audyences. In manner of lightenynge it
moves some / making of earth heaven / and of sinners godly people. A sownde
or a noise only it is to some men / not regarding the fruits thereof. To
some it is an occasyon of anger / spyght and madness / and to some of open
blasphemye against the Holy Ghost. For what else does the clergy /
malycyouslye withstanding it / but wylfullye work against knowledge? And what
does the indiscreet ^ayte / blinded by them / but Babble they woote not what?

4 And a great hayle also followed / which betokens the vehement and sharp
judgments of God^ toward soche enemies of his veryte. The most terryble
tempest of his I^e abides them. The Lord shall break into the land (says
the Prophet^ Esaye) like a sore rempest of hayle that breaks down strong
holds or castell^s. And the proud crown of the dronken Ephraemytes shall be
trodden under foot. Not only is the last age appointed to these thonderynges /
and earthquakes / but they began also so sone as Christ apered in the flesh.
No sonner was the young babe borne / but Herod for madness sought to slay him
in his very infancye. The Pharisees and Scribes / the bishops / prestes /
and lawers swelled at his preaching and never left till they had slain him.
And this rewle with the prelates and hypocrytes has continued ever sens / and
still shall do till the latter day. Only is there and shall be a moderacyon /
that sometime yt is not so extreme as at some. For if yt were always a like /
there should non be left.

1 And there apered a great wonder in heaven. 2. A woman clothed with the
Sun. 3. and the Moon under her fete. 4. and upon her head / a crown of.xii.
Stars. 5. And she was with child. 6. and cried / trauelynge in birth. 7.
and payned / redye to be delivered.

The Paraphrase.
1 And there apered / says Saint Ioha^) a great token in heaven* For no wonder
is this token here to be taken / as in other places of the Scripture / but for
a type or figure / contayninge under mysterye great things.

2 A woman was seane clothed with the son / yea / of Johan* For to Gods only
electes is the veryte showed to advantage. Not Marye Christ's mother is this
woman / though many has so fantasyed in their commentaryes. But yt is the
true christen church of whom Marye is a most notable member

3 This woman the church (as Salomons cantycles specyfyeth) is fair / louelye
/ plesaunt / sweet / wholesome / dilectable / undefiled as the Moon / excellent
in clerenesse as the son / and glorious as an army of men with their
banners and stremers. This woman is bewtyfullye decked with the shynynge son
of ryghtousnesse. No^ is of her that has not done on Jesus Christ / being
renewed in their hearts by faith. Her children are not they that persecuteth
Gods word / no more than was Annas and Caiphas. Ioannes and Alexander.

This women (...) to have the mo^ne under her f^te. To the church or
congregation of God are all other creature (...). ^ll (...) things have the
lord su^dewed unto her. She is the right ^heyre and inheritoure of them
through Christ / they with her to be delivered from the bondage of corrupcyon
and to serve in liberte.

4 Upon her head was also a crown of twelve stars / which betokens not
only the twelve Apostles declarynge the glory of Christ's kyngedome
immediatlye after his death / but all other godly mynistres of the word also
/ which have done the same ever sens. Only regneth the true Christen church
by the word of God / by the sincere scrypturs / by the doctrine of the
Apostles / and neither by superstycyons nor ceremonies / neither by cownsels
nor customs by doctors nor fathers / by myters nor rochettes / by typpettes
nor whodes / by shaven crowns nor syne gowns / by crosses nor copes / by
belles nor torches / by shrynes nor gyl^e Images / nor yet by.xii. cupples in a
^yuerye with golden cheanes and garden (...). Her bewtye consists only in
faith / and in the obseruacyon of Gods holy commandeme^tes. Her true
mynysters or preachers as very chosen Stars / shows forth his glory to
the edyficacyo^ of other / and not their own pomp aod magnificence

5 And she was as is the woman with child. She cried trauelynge in birth /
and was payned as one redye to be delivered. With Christ is the church bygge
when her members are in full faith. In the heart is he evermore conceived / and
delivered forth soche time as he is declared unto other. For this cause Christ
called them his mother which had faith and thereupon ded the will of his
father. Of faith in the first promise that Christ should destroy the Serpent /
was be first conceived in Adam and Eua / and so grew forth in ryghtouse Abell
/ in Seth / Enos / Enoch / Noe / Sem / Their / Melchisedech / Abraham / and
Loath. And as the promyses waxed stronger (as in Abraham / Moses / David / and
the Prophets) and the people of God more in nombre / so wexed the woman byggar
and byggar / till the fullness of her time was come that she should be
delivered. Which was soche time as Christ apered to the world / taught / and
was co^uersau^t here among me^ne. And this course have she kept ever se^s /
and shall do to the latter day in the^ that believe. Thus have she had Christ
in her womb sens the beginning.

6 And being full of his heavenly sprete / she has cried in the Patriarchs
and Prhphetes / in the Apostles and faithful mynysters / as one trauelynge in
birth. Her cry was the mighty and strong declaracyon of Christ's doctrine /
the fervent zele and desire of the glory of God / and of all-mennes health in
Christ. She trauayleth evermore a new like as ded Paul / till Christ be
fashioned in her Christen members. With all her strength she labors that
the promised Sede may increase in the faith of all men.

7 Fynallye she is payned with labors / dolours / blasphemies / trobles / and
terryble persecucyons / and never is delivered without them. Never is Christ
ernestlye received / till some of her members does suffer. The constaunt sprete
and inuyncyble standing by the truth in them / has converted many. And like
as the payned woman in all her agonyes / is much conforted by the hope of a
child / so are Gods faithful witnesses / trusting that by their pacyent and
glad sufferaunce / Christ should be received and ryghtlye fashyoned in many.
Yea / this causes them to reyoce in all aduersite / and little to esteem their
pains.

1 After this (says Saint Johan) apered in heaven an other token or maruele /
all diverse from the first. The true church (which is Gods kingedome) was
never yet without co^tradyccyo^ / nor with out the craftye assaults of
enemies. Adam was not so sone created / but he was immedyatlye assaulted of
Satan. Christ entered not so sone the world / but he was bye and bye
persecuted. The devil goes about like a roaryngely on / seeking whom he
may deuowre.

2 For behold there was seane a great reed dragon / betokenynge the said
devil with his whole retynewe / full of deceyt / craft / malice / poison /
pride / and fercenesse / to enforce the psore weakelynges to consent unto his
falshede. All reed his b^^ye seemed / in token that they which are of him / are
all full of cruelte / spyght and blood shedynge / afflyctynge the constaunt
beleuers for withstandinge his assaults. Seldo^ is ke out of the earth / as
witnesses Job / but commonly in the company of men / impugninge the
faithful. And no power is able to match him / unless yt comes from above.

3 The said dragon had seven heads / sygnyfienge all the craftye wyles / and
subtle suggestyons / that he has practysed and used against Christ and his
word under all the.vij. seals opening and the vij. trompettes blowynge*
Very easy yt is to conjecture what manner of heads they were / markynge other
places of the scripture. A Serpents head should seem to be the first /
consyderinge that in the Serpent he deceived our first pare^tes with his
benemed crafts. This head so malycyouslye poysened ma^ne / that God repented
him of his creacyo^ / and destroyed his whole kind in the flood.viii. persons
only reserved. After the flood had he the head of a Calfe for the second / in
sygnificacyon of the shameful Idolatrye / and wicked worshyppynge that then
begone in Nemroth / and so contyned in the heythen. The third was the head of
a lion / full of pride and oppression / expressed first in the cruel reign of
the Assyryanes and Caldeanes / and after in the proud bishops and prestes.
The forth was a Bears / head / full of rauyne and cruelnesse / betokenynge the
f^rce kyngedome of the medes and perseanes. Consequentlye his fifth head was
like a leopardes head of many colors / full of fycklenesse and change
ableness. And that was the inconstant reygne of the Greeks. His sixth was the
head of a Beast far unlike all other beasts / which sygnyfyeth the kyngedome
of the Romans with their monstruouse laws more than needs. The seventh is
not unlike to a man's head / includynge all carnal wisdom / with all
deuyllyshe polycyes and crafts / and this is the very papacye here in* Europa
/ which is the general Antichrist of all the whole world almost / which has
already subdued and destroyed the Empire of Rome. For he is called the
Apostata and manne of sin. By this only head is the Dragon named the
enuyouse manne. The whole body follows the heads. As the devil is
malycyouse / wicked / ferce / cruel tyrannycall fal^e / execrable / and
deceytfull / ^o are all his members. In the prudence of the flesh after him
they walk in Idolatry / hipocreyse and all other fylthynesse. And like as a
fore Christ's (...) these heads were in the Serpe (...) the golden Calves / in
the kyngedome of Babylon / in Nemroth / in Pharao / in antiochus / and in the
pharisees and S^ribes bishops / lawers / and prestes / so have they been sens
his time under the v^ seals opening / and the. vij. trompettes blowynge /
after the same (...) Under the first / he had a Serpents head in the Jews /
most malycyouslye and subtyllye withstandinge Christ and his Apostles /
prete^dynge the zele of God and his laws. Under the second / he had a calves
head in the Idolatours / which sl^we the cons^eunt witnesses of Christ's
veryte. Under the third / the head of a proud lion in the bold rabble of
heretykes / presumynge against Gods word to afferme ungodly things. Under
the forth / the head of a Bear / in the gredye multitude of holy hypocrites
and spiritual Antichrists / which has rauyshed up the substance of this
world / vsurpinge the empire of the same. For then begone the papacye with
Mahometes myscheff. Under the fifth / the head of a leoparde / in the dyuersyte
of pestilent sects or execrable locustes / of whom every one reioyseth in
his own color and invention. For then ded they sore increase. Under the sixth
/ the head of a Beast unlike to all other / in the Tyranny of wicked
gouer^^^^^ blinded and persuaded by the Prestes to flee Gods servants for the
vpholdynge of their stynkinge generacyon. For then was and is yet done much
murder / upon soche as confesses the truth. Under the seventh or last seal
opening / shall he have yet still the head of a ma^ne / in fleshelye polycyes
and falshede of the pope and his prelates / in the doctors and prestes / till
God utterly shall destroy them with the breathe of his mouth.

4 The said dragon had also.x. horns / or all subtle ways wherewith to impugn
the feeble weak nature of man / or to provoke him evermore to rebel against
Gods commandementes.

5 Upon his seven heads he had.vij / crowns / sygnyfie^ge therbye that both
he and his members has not only possessed the before named vices / but also
they have over the world reigned in the^ and yet do to this day. In pride /
falshede / malice / craft / cruelte wickedness / and all other myscheues
triu^phe they yet.

6 And his tail drue toward him the third part of the stars (and in
conclusion shrewe them down to the ^arthe. By worldly promocyons / lucre /
fauer / and other flattering / fan^asyes / has he tangled many learned men
/ and plucked the^ clean from Christ's true church / and from the life of the
gospel / so prono^^ynge them whollye to give them selves to the stodye of
erronyouse doctrine and lyenge prophecyes / to seduce the worldly multitude
and keep them in perpetual blindness.

7 So that they are now cast into the earth. They are become all carnal /
filthy and ungodly in all their wisdom / stodye / and works / in all their
counsels / preachynges / and teachinges. Now are they the wicked Apostles of
Satan / no longar may they shine in the fyt mament.

1 And the dragon stood before the woman / which was redye to be delivered. 2.
for to devour her child as soon as it were borne / 3. And she brought forth a
man child. 4. which should rule all nacyons with a rod of iron 5. And her
son was taken up unto God / and to his seat. 6. And the woman fled into
wilderness. 7. where she had a place prepared of God. 8. that they should feed
her there. 9. a thousand / two hundred / and three score days.

1 Before the before said trauaylinge woman stood this dragon / redye to devour
her child / so sone as it were borne. Ever more ^s the devil waytinge his
pray / where as the gospel is syncerelie taught / least any therbye should
become the children of God.

2 He sel^eth all crafts / polycyes / and ingynnes / to take the word from
the har^ / least they beleuynge yt should be saved. Thus Tought he to deuowre
Christ after the letter / appoyntinge Herod to slay him sone after his birth.
and wha^ he se that way would not take / yet left he not of till the Jews had
slain him. Not thus yet satisfied / he labored by the bishops to
extynguishe the faith of his resurreccyon / least that should profyght unto
life. More over where as the Apostles and other godly me^ne / has given
Christ unto other in manner as they received him / he has left no cauteles
unsought by his malygnaunt members ever sens to depryue Gods people thereof.

3 Soche a man child (says Saint Johan) brought this woman forth / as with an
iron rod should rewle all nacyons. Never is the true church Idle / but
conceyueth Christ at the gospel preaching / retayneth him in faith / and
brings him forth in teaching other the same. No woman child is he /
impotent / weak and feeble / but a manchylde / brynginge with him always a
strange / mighty / and inuincyble sprete / where as he is unfeignedly received.
For he is the mighty lord that is valeaunt in battle.

4 With the iron wande of his word inuyncible shall he govern his meke
spreted flock / that non other laws shall they require. With the same also
shall he subdue al powers which are not of him / and drive them down to the
bottom of hell. For by faith only in him to the victory gotten over the
world

5 This child was also taken up to God / and unto his trone. Where as the
devil thought to deuowre him / and to wrappe him up for ever under death / he
put him beside his purpose. Uyctoryouslye he arose up from death to life / he
ascended unto heaven / and now sytteth upon the right hand of God the father
almyghtye. And where as he is now / there shall his faithful folowers and
mynysters be here after. for that is his / is also theirs / birth / life /
death / resurreccion and ascencion.

6 The woman fled after this into the wilderness. What else does te just
people of God? but flee the co^tagiousnesse / vanyte / tumulte / fornicacio^ /
Idolatrye / and fylthinesse of this world? seeking God in the solytarye heart /
and not in outward fantacies. I got me away far of (says David) and
remained in the desert. Monks / nonnes / chanons and fryres / has fled into
monasteries / couentes / and howses / but nothing after this sort. For in all
voluptuouse pleasurs have they there lived. The unfeigned solitarye manne after
Hieremye / continues peceablye with him self / and has his heart above.

7 In the said wilderness had she a place prepared of God. Which is no^ other
but Gods proteccio^ / defense / and sauegarde / promised in the scripturs. That
the lord should preserve us as he ded his chosen people of Israel / when he went
before them in a cloud upon the day / and in the night in a pyller of fire.
David boasted him self that God was his refiuge / and that he dwelled under the
defense and shaddowe of the highest. So long as the lord is my governor
(says he) I can want nothing. He fedeth me / he sustayneth me / I doubt no
danger / for he is with me. His staff stays one / his word and promise is
my whole confort.

8 And there will the lord feed her (says saint Johan) for the space of a
thousand / two hondreth / and.lx. days. Non other are fend with the
scripturs and promises of God (which is the bread of children not to be given
to dogs) but they which flees into this desert from the Dragon / forsakynge
both head and tail / both suggestions / and laws / both customs and
constytucions. For all are deuyllyshe. Non other escaped the plage of Sodom /
but they which fled clean from thens. Lor^es wise but lokynge back only
toward yt again / was turned into a salt stone.

9 The nombred days here are non other but the before written time of the two
witnesses / the time of Helias preachinge / the time of Iohans preaching / the
time of Christ's preachinge / or the time of the gospel preaching from
Christ's ascencyo^ to the latter end of the world. That is the very time of
the feadynge of his church. And not open is this feadinge here / but secret
in the wldernesse / among a sort unknown to the world / having the pouerte
of sprete without shauynge / anoyntinge / or Hipocrytes apparel. And not only
has the lord thus noryshed his people in this spiritual respect / but also in
body. When they have been greuouslye handled / spoiled of their goods /
impresoned / and exyled / gracyouslye has he releued them / and provided for
them both solate and confort a^ the hands of the^ whom they never saw before.
So that the just has not felt him self forsaken / nor his childre^seking
bread.

The Paraphrase.
1 And there happened at that time (says saint Johan) a great battle in
heaven. In the church is evermore variau^ce and strife without ceasynge /
betwixt the sprete and the flesh / the good and the badde / the faithful and
the unfaithful. Non other is this battle but a very contradiccion / a
dyuersite in faith / stodye / opynion / will / and work / about the laws or
commandments of God / and also about the laws and tradycyons of men. This
battle is wayghtye in cause / multitude / and continuance. The cause thereof
is Christ / the gospel / faith / rightousnesse / man's health / Gods high
honor / and soche other like on the one party. Upon the other party the
cause is / error / hypocrisy / lies / ydolatrie / avarice / pride / cruelte /
fylthynesse / with all soche other. So great is the multitude / that non is
fownde out of its Non is there but are in this army. Either they are good or
badde / faithful or unfaithful / ryghtouse or vnrightouse. The rightouse are
of the host of Michael / the vnrightouse are upon the drago^s side. Continued
have this battle from the first beginning / and so shall still to the latter
end. Yea / thowgh the dragon be bownde or tied up under the.vij. seal
opening / that he rage not then as he has done before. Yet shall the sprete of
wickedness / and a mind to do mischef reygne inwardlye still in his members.
for a Satan can be but a Satan / and a devil a devil.

2 Michael and his angels fought vale auntlye with the dragon. Spyrituall are
they which has done on Christ after the mind of Paul / and spiritual is
their armor. Their gyrdinge is verite / their breast plate rightousnesse /
their shilde a sure faith / their weapon the word of God / their helmet the
hope of health / and for stedefastnesse of their fete their showinge the
gospel. By interpretacion is Michael to say / who is as God? or who is like
unto God? And he betokens the constaunt ministers and sincere teachers of the
gospel. The angels of Michael are all they that in a sure faith confesses
the eternal magnificence of God / and that non is like unto him. Contrary
wise the dragons angels are the hipocrites / lye^ge prophets / and erronyouse
teachers.

3 These fight with the dragon / and the dragon and his angels with them. For
he that is not with Christ / is against him. With the ryghteouse is Michael.
For mynystrynge spretes are the angels ordained for the confort of them which
shall be saved. And commanded they are to wait upon the faithful / to
preserve and defend them. The wicked sort have the devil and his chaplaynes
to fight for them / the ryghtouse have Michael and his angels. The wicked
fyghteth with errors and lies / the ryghteouse with the only veryte of God.

4. As vengeable and as ferce as they are / yet prevail they not / neither is
their place fownde any more in heaven. Faith has the vyctorye by the promise
of God / though the blind world seyth it not. Ouercomen are the wicked wha^
their enterpryses takes not / and clean overthrown wha^ their beggerye is
contempned. And never is the full vyctorye gotten / no more than yt was in
Christ / till the tabernacle of this body be laid a side. At that day is the
crown gotten / whom the lord has laid up for the ryghtouse. And like as
there is daily fighting / so is there in some / daily vyctorye. Daily are
the angels of darkness overthrown / daily are they cast out of heaven /
which is the true church. Daily are they co^de^pned by the word of God / and
judged for rebels against the holy Ghost / whose sin is never forgeuen.

5 No place have they any more with the chosen / no eleccyon nor acceptacyon /
before God. The more light they have had and the more they have tasted of the
truth now forsakinge yt and rebellyng against yt with the devil / the farther
they are from God / and the more nygh unto da^pnacyon. Never believed he truly
/ that so had received the word. Let no^ think to be saved / unless he
perseuereth to the end.

6 And the great Dragon / or captain of all the unfaithful sort / that old
crooked Serpent which deceived Ada^ and is called the devil or malycyouse
accuser / yea / and also Satan the most cruel aduersarye with all his
elyentes and spiritual adherentes / are certain and sure to be cast out.

7 With the ryghtouse shall they have no porcyon for all their gloriouse
tytles. With the godly shall not their names be regestred / for all their
holy vnccyo^s. But with the prince of this world they shall be thrown forth.

8 For he by them / and they by him / has deceived all the world / in lyenge
tokens and wonders / and in the operacyo^ of errors / to the utter da^pnacyon
of all the^ that co^senteth to their wickedness.

9 And he was cast into the earth / and his a^gels also were cast out with him
/ which is not else but that they are reserved to eternal dam^nacion. For
serving the creature rather than the lord that made all / God has forsaken
them / and given the^ over to their own shameful lusts. All grace and
goodness has he taken from them / and in all darkness has he left them.
Nothing is now behind but hell fire / prepared for the devil and his
angels. The church thus first bringing forth Christ among the Jews / and so
by their cruelte dryu^e out into the wyld desert of the Gentyles / has been
there fed of God in persecucyon ever sens / and shall be still till the term
come out of the aforesaid thowsande / two hondreth / and three score days /
whose end is in the lords hands.

The Paraphrase.
1 And I hard a mighty great voice (says saint Ioha^) which is the whole
agreement of all the sacred scripturs. And the voice said thus unto me.

2 Now is there in heaven salvation. In the church is the health of soul now
that the Idolatry with other abhominacions is thrown forth / and she clean
delivered from their beggerie. Now apereth the power of the lord / that his
gospel is truly preached.

3 Now is it become our Gods kyngedome / that their doctrine is not of men.

4 Now has yt the whole srengthe of his a noynted. All Christ's labors /
merytes / and deservings / his natyuyte / passion / resurreccyon / and
ascencyo^ / is now her own good. Christ's vyctorye is theirs / his crown /
his scrpture / his seat / and kyngedome is theirs. Yea the possessyo^ of his
fathers right hand us theirs.

5 For the enemy of our brethren is thrown down / which cruellye accused
the^ before God day and night. The ad^uersarye Satan which quareled before
the lord against pacie^t Job / and vexed him sore in his substance and flesh
/ never ceasynge to this day to troble the ryghtouse with Antichrists and
tyrauntes / is now over comen by the vyctorye of faith / and his power
greatly demynyshed in his members. Now is the kingedome of God increased /
much people being unfeignedly converted unto Christ

6 Conquerred him they have by no power of their own / neither merytes nor
works / but through the inestimable stre^gthe which is in the blood of the
immaculate la^be Jesus Christ / and through the in vyncyble word of his veryte
/ which they to the world have testyfyed.

7 In the witness thereof have they constauntlye suffered / and through faith
in them have they with him aptayned vyctorye over the world / sin / hell /
death / and the devil Not their own bodies have they spared to win this
conquest.

8 But much more have they loved Christ and his truth tha^ themselves /
accountynge yt advantage to give their lives for him.

9 Therefore reyoyce ye heavens / and all you that in them does dwell. Ye angels
a boue ordained for man's confort / ye saints departed from the myst^yes of
this worth / ye faithful beleuers remay^inge in this life / and ye fervent
favorers of the lords veryte / be glad that your brethren has got the
vyctorye of the devil and his angels to the glory of Christ.

10 But woo unto the wreched inhabitauntes of the earth / and of the sea. No
small danger is toward them that has hard the voice of the lord / and
still yet will follow the course of this wordle. No light parel ha^geth over
their heads / that are inconstaunt / fickle / and wauerynge / geuynge back
with every blast for the pleasure of their flesh.

11 Take heed of yt therefore / for unto you that are soche / the devil is come
down with his subtle suggestyons and crafts / with his wylye cauteles and
ingyns. ^monge you does he remain watchynge to have his pray / as he ded
among the children of Israel / when they were become unfaithful.

12 Tares will he sow to destroy the good sede / for his wrath is great to
se him self thus dejected / and his hate is exceeding / beholdinge his kingedom
decayed. Among you must he wreake his anger / for he cannot harm the
faithful. Through his envy same death first in to the world. If ye will
escape his snares / look ye give no place unto him / but in faith resist him
manfullye.

13 He wexeth now mad / and fretteth with him self. He minds to make hauock
and to do much myschef / because he knows that his time is short. No long
season shall he have from hence forth to deceive. The latter day he perseyueth
not to be far of / wherein great torments abides both him and his. And that
makes him so wode. That makes him so insaciablye desyerouse to noye / not
carynge what spyght he works against God. And no wicked wyle leaves he
unsought / to perform his cruel intent. Woo unto them therefore that in these
days takes no head. Woo unto them that Rombreth in wanton pleasurs / when
most danger is / and the devil most bysye / not attendynge to the call and
warning of God.

The Paraphrase.
1 And when the Dragon or most furyouse serpent the devil / the head master of
pride and father of lies / saw that he was thrown down unto the earth by
the valeaunt ho^te of God. Or soche time as he perseyueth the Idolatrye /
superstycyon / pomp / Hipocresye / and other abominable fylthynesse /
destroyed by the word of God in his malygnaunt Synagoge of proud painted
prelates.

2 Tha^ persecuteth he the poor woman / which brought forth the manchylde.
Than vereth he the true congregacyon that teacheh no^ other but Christ / and
confesses non other sauer / health / and redemer. Them does he torment and
ponnyshe by his mytred Mahowndes and his shaue^ Sodomytes / subduynge unto them
for that purpose the power of kings / and might of magistrates. Then sytteth
Annas in consystorye / and Cayphas in sessyons upon life and death. Then
brings the woman her child forth in pain. By the martyrdom or death of
godly witnesses is Christ delivered / and left here behind in the hearts of
many.

3 And unto the woman were given two wings of a great egle / or the two
testamentes of God / contayninge the Prophecye and Gospel / with the love of
God and our neyber. And these mighty wings were given her that she might
fly with them into the wilderness. Evermore when daungerouse persecucyon is /
the members of Christ's congregacyon (which are left here behind) has
auctoryte of the old law to flee from yt with Jacob / Moses / David / and
Helias / of the new law also with Christ and his Apostles. If they pursue ye
in one cite (says the lord) flee you into an other. Not only to save your
bodies / but to f^uctifye in the people. Set ye into the desert. Teach the^
that were not taught before. If ye ca^ not be suffered openly to preach /
instruct men priuatelye in howses. Play not the sluggardes in the lords
vyneyarde. Be not niggardes over his fre treasure. But as ye have ple^iuouslye
received it so liberallye distrybute it again.

4 From the face of the dragon has the woman thus power to fly into the
wilderness by the scripturs / when her child is delivered and taken up to the
trone of God for the unthankfulness of the people / that they have not in
faith received him. And in much danger are they left / having the devil
and his angels thrown down among them with their wyles and craftye snares.
In much more parell are they / them they were before.

5 A place has she in this desert appointed of God / wherein she is norryshed
for a time / for times / and for the half time / which is not else but his
special proteccion among them that be poor in sprete / and are judged
outcastes of the world. There is the true church norryshed with the pure
word / not mixed with the leven of Pharysees. There is the faithful
congregation at all times fed / without the tradicyons of hipocrites. Only
are they releued with the veryte / and satisfied with the lyuinge prom^ses /
and have been sens the time of Christ. Yea / sens the time of Daniell and
before. And this fedynge time of the lord in secretnesse / has been sometime
shorter / sumtyme longer / and sumtyme shortest of all / according to the
times of persecucyon / and of blyndenesse in the enemies.

6 To flee from the presence of the Serpente / have they evermore had
commandementes of the lord / and to shurne the suggestions of his angels.
Warned they have been in no wise to go forth / when they say / Christ is here
and there / for so much as their crafts are soche as would (if yt were
possible) deceive the very electes.

7 And the Dragon (says saint Johan) ded cast out of his mouth water after
the woman. A^ doctrine, of Hypocresye / errors / and lies has always passed
from the Synagoge of Satan. Non other fruits has gone from them / than
waverynge superstycyons / Idolatry / and Heythen ceremonies. These has ^lowed
forth like a great river. Daily, have they augmented / and contynuallye
increased. Innumerable are the co^berouse and unprofitable burdens of their
fantasyes and dreams / wherewith they noye men's conscyences / drown their
small faith / and ouerloade their sowles.

8 This stynkynge water ded the Serpent vomete out by his rauenouse
Antichrists) which are his insacyable mouth) to stop the passage of the
woman* He powered yt forth in habundau^ce that he might cause her to be caught
of the flood. Soche is always the myscheuouse nature of the devil and his
angels. Vengeable assaults have they / and innumerable crafts to deceive the
innocent not knowinge them. Our first mother Eua was thus trapped in the
beginning / and so had been drowned with Adam her husband / had they not had
faith in the promised sede. An innumerable multitude has been and are yet to
this day swallowed up of this flood and without great difficulte non escapes
yt. Exceeding is the compass / stodye / and practyse of this false generacyon.
Evermore power they out their poison / they dyspute their matters with errors
and lies / with counsels and customs / having upon their side the darkened
powers.

9 Yet is the lord merciful to his pore congregacyo^ / that they are not
drowned with all this filthy floude. Non of yt ones touches their hearts. No
part of their faith does all this ryff raff hinder. This dyrtye baggage
acco^breth not their sowles. Only are they satysfyed with the wholesome doctrine
of Christ's sprete. And the earth ded help the woman (says Saint Johan) The
carnal multitude / the wise men of this world / the very reprobates from
God / all dry with out the true faith / drank up this filthy water.

10 They opened their mouths wide / and swallowed up the great river clean /
which the Dragon cast out of his mowthe. This erroniouse doctrine was ever more
plesaunt unto them. Much more have they always delyghted in lies / and old
wives dreams than in Gods truth. Thereto have they given their ears / with
all auydyouse gredynesse and superstycyouse devotion have they embraced them.
But the lyuinge waters of the lord sauoreth not in their mouths / their own
broken cys^e^nes does please them best. Better is to a swyne a filthy puddle /
than a sweet ro^nynge water. No where will he drink / but where he may
wallowe his earkas. No doctrine pleases them / unless yt maynteyneth their
sin.

11 In drinking up this flood / yet ease they this woman. In seek multitude
is christ's small flock not myssed, no^ lo^ed for / nor yet many times in their
abhominacyo^s perceived to be absent. So gracious to them is the lord / that
in no wise are they harmed with those vnwholso^ waters. They are not caught of
that pestilent flood. It ouerwhelmeth not their faith.

12 And the dragon was wroth with the woman (says says Johan) frantycke and
mad is the Synagoge of Satan / when their wanton ware is forsaken / abhorred
/ and despised. Than frette they for anger / than swelle they for wodenesse.
Than where they their tethe upon the innocent sowles / and would tear them in
pieces for very spyght. Tha^ Imagyne they new cawteles and wyles / and
thereupon procure they new laws to be made / to trappe them in snares that
they escape no way.

13 For the dragon in his wrath / made war with the remnaunt of her sede /
which kept the commandementes of God. All manner of ways has this Serpente
assayed to destroy Christ's true church. The Apostles he vexed with the
Pharisees and P^estes / for the first age. With false brethren and tyrauntes
trobled he their successors for the second age. For the third / with
innumerable Heresies ded he acco^bre them. For the fourth / with damnable
sects of Hypocresye ded he oppress them. For the fifte brought he the world
into a damnable peace of Idolatrye and supersticyo^. And for the sixth (seeing
he can not yet prevail) he makes open war upon the remnaunt of her sede.

14 Now does his Synagoge of Prelates / Prestes / Hypocrites / and tyrauntes /
make wicked laws against them. Now do they persecute them for keeping the
commandementes of God / in marryage / in receyuinge meats with thanks geuynge
/ and in not going out to seek Christ here and there in their Masses and
mutterynges / in their outward colors and shadows.

15 Now put they them to death / which have the Testimonye of Jesus Christ /
preaching him for an only teacher necessary / for an only mediatoure and
advocate / for an only sauer and redemer / for our only ryghtousnesse /
wisdom / and health. For their war is only against them that keep Gods
commandments / and that have the witness of Jesus Neither is yt against
bawdes nor whores / against murderers nor thieves / against Idolatours nor
Hypocrites / sorcerers nor Sodomytes / aduowterers nor glottons / Idyotes nor
liars / Idle prestes nor vagabondes / scysmatykes nor traitors. Non of these
seek they out. Non of these accuse they as their sessyons / but the only
readers of the gospel / and poor favorers of Gods truth.

16 Upon the ^re sand stand they ever more with their gra^de captain / to
fight this battle. No^ other laws have they to grownde themselves upon / but
their own tradycyons and ^customes / with soche fantastycall acts as they
daily make / or procure to be made of Princes for their own wicked purpose.
And as their laws are beggerlye and weak / so is their usurped auctoryte / so
are their proud tytles / so are their myters / their anoyntinges / and
pompouse funccyons. All are sand / duste / and rotten powder before God / not
grounded upon his word. All are unprofitable chafe. Yea / their selves are a
ground unfruitful / sandye / and unsure / fytt for the dragon to stand upon
to fight against Christ's members. For they are the very seat of Satan / and
his contynuall dwelling place. And that he can not do by himself / he
brings evermore to pass by them. Innumerable also are their deuyllyshe
practyses / their wyles / and their subtiltees to uphold their master / as a^^
the sands of the sea.

fyckle felyshyppe and moveable multitude of the ungodly. For the wicked sort
after Esaye / are the ragynge see that can not rest / whose water fometh with
the mire and grauel. No peace is among the ungodly (says the lord) no unity
/ no charity / nor mutual christian love. It pleased therefore the holy ghost to
provoke Johan after his secret vysyon / to describe this mighty Antichrist
thus in his right colors / according to that he had seane / to the fore
warning of Christ's people.

The Paraphrase.
1 I beheld (says Saint Johan) an execrable Beast / very odyouse and
hateful to look upon / rysynge out of the rauenouse roarynge see. For the
wicked auaunceth themselves as the grene baye tree in ungodliness / and the
Synagoge of proud Hipocrytes ryseth up aloft / setting up their cristes / as
does the fat Cedar trees of libanus. All beastlye are they / as was Elymas
the sorcerer / full of fylthynesse / gyle / and falshede / yea / the very
whelps of the devil subuertynge the ways of God. Non other is this Beast
here described / than was the pale horse in the forth age / the cruel
multitude of locustes in the fifth age / and the horses of incomparable
wodenesse for the sixth.

2 Seaue^ heads and.x. horns had this cruel beast not unlike therein / to the
aforesaid read dragon or Serpent. For* look what pestyle^t suggestyons in
errors and lies / and what deceyuable power in signs and wonders has reigned
in the devil for all ages / the same also has reigned in the wicked members of
his Besty all body / in the furyous bishops / lawers / doctors / prestes /
Hypocrytes / and false magistrates / for their heads are their universal
crafts / and their horns their tyrannouse auctorytees / usurped primacyes /
or malygnau^t magistrates. Thy strong / mighty power lord (says David) has
broken the dragons heads in the ragynge waters. Thu have smytte^ in pieces the
heads of the greatele^^athan. Inhaunce not yowr horns so high ye styffnecked
Antichrists / for the horns of the ungodly will the lord pluck down / and
exalte the horns of the ryghtous / in the house of David his servant. More
are the horns here in nombre than are the heads. For greatter is the power
than is the suggestyon / the usurped auctoryte than the craft / the Mageste
than the error / and much more myscheff may work.

3 This Beast had upon his.x. horns.x. crowns / sygnyfyenge his vyctorye /
domynyon / and prymacye over the universal world / and that he through the
wickedness of the people / is the unworthy captain and prince thereof. In this
only point ^yffereth the Dragon from the Beast / the devil from his members /
or satan from his carnal Synagoge. He had.vij. crowns upon his.vij. heads.
They have.x. crowns here upon their x. horns. For that he has but in simple
suggestyon / they have in double power of coaccyon. Where as he does but
dallyenglye persuade / they may enforce and compel. Where as he does but
easelye move / they may by rygorouse auctoryte constrayne. When he has
propowned a^ error / they may by their power establyshe yt for an infallyble
truth / and make of yt a necessary article of the christen believe / as they
have done of purgatory / pardons / confessyo^ / saints worshyppynge / latten
service hearing / and soche like. Wha^ he has ones made a lie (as he is the
father of all lies) they may auctoryse yt for an vnwritte^ veryte / like as
they have done many. Much more myscheff may they do / being his spyrytuall
instrumente^ than he can do alone / as largelye apereth by their works. Never
could Satan have putt Christ unto death / had he not entered into Judas and so
betrayed him / had he not entered into the Bysshoppes and lawers and so
condemned him. Never had the Apostles / nor all other godly preachers sens
their time / been sent out of the way / had not those mytred Mahometes' and
prestes wrought still their old feats.

4 Upon this be astes head was written the names of blasphemye against the
lord and his Christ. Which are non other tha^ the proud glitterynge tytles /
wherewith they garnyshe their usurped auctoryte / to make yt seem gloriouse to
the world / having within the^ contained / the great mysterye of inyquite.
What other else is pope / Cardynall / Patriarch / lega^e / Metropolytane /
primate Archebysshoppe / Dyocelane / Prothonotarye / Archedeako^ / Offycyall /
Chaunceller / Commissarye / Deane / Prebe^de / Person / vycar / my lord Abbott
/ master doctor / and soche like / but very names of blasphemy* For offices
they are not appointed by the holy Ghost / nor yet ones me^cyoned in the
scripturs. What other is yt but abhominacio^ / the pope to write himself the
most holy father / the general vycar of Christ / the supreme head of the
Chris^en church / and the only dystrybuter of the treasurs of God? The
bysshoppes and prestes also to call them selves their churches brydegromes /
sytters in Gods stead / forgeuers of sin / and our ladies chaste knights?
Non other are they so abusing their flock in leaving the just office of
sincere preaching under soche vain tytles / after the mind of Zacharye / but
very shameful Idols in deed. Their decrees / decretals / Constytucio^s /
Canons / Rewles / Statutes prouyncyall and synodall / tradycyons / laws /
fatherlye customs / and vsages / not grounded upon Gods commandementes / are
very deuylyshnesse and Hipocresye / blasphemynge the name of God. For why /
to have the name of blasphemye upon their heads / is non other / than under a
gloryouse title to maynteyne that thing which is blasphemouse / gloryfyenge
themselves in the same. The ungodly (says David) with mockes has dysdayned
the lord / and with open mouth has vttred wickedness against God.

5 And the stran^ge fashoned beast (says Saint Johan / whom I saw in this
vysyon / was like in similitude to a catte of the mountain / full of many
colored spots in token of inconstancye / varyete / and fycklenesse.

6 His fete were as the fete of a bear / ferce / rough / and ill favored / in
sygnyficacyon of cruelte / stubbernesse / and uncleanness.

7 And his mouth seemed as the mouth of a lion / declarynge him to be full of
pride / rauyne / and excess. To soche beasts as here are mencyoned compares
Danyel under hidden misterye / serten mighty kingedomes of the world. As to
the lioness (which here is called a lion for the more cruelte now used than
was in those days) the proud kyngedomes of the Assyryanes and Caldeanes. To
the Bear the cruel kyngedomes of the Medes and Parthyanes. And unto the Catte
of the mountain / the vnstedefast kyngedome of the Greeks. Of pride / spoil /
and roborye are the Assyrianes and Caldeanes condemned by Esaye / Nahum / and
Abacuch the Prophets. The Medes and Parthianes held captyue the people of God
/ as witnesses Hester / Paralipomenon / and Esaye. The Greeks most
spyghtfullye were bent against them under the cruel king Antiochus / as in
the Machabees is euydent. No abhominacion nor mystery of inyquyte / as Paul
calls yt / was ever found in these kyngedomes / but now reygneth manyfolde
in the detestable Papacye or monstruouse kyngedome of Antichrist / as all the
world may se. No where was ever more pride vanyte and cruelnesse / Ydolatry
whoredom and fylthynesse / hypocresye falshede and fycklenesse / extorcyon
vayneglorye and covetousness / sorcerye superstycion and unfaithfulness. More
than all the unfaithful kyngedomes under heaven / have this sodomyticall
spyritualte defiled with their wytcherye the ho^ye temple of God / which is the
Christen church. They have most shame fullye abused gods chosen people / which
are the vessels ordained to his glory. They have holden his fre servants most
myserablye captyue / under their wicked decrees and tradycions. The cruelte of
Pharao / Antiochus / and Cayphas / compared to their tyranny / is but as yt
were a play / dallyaunce / or shaddowe. In them is all letherye and
uncleanness / all ragynge lusts and wantonness / all fleshly abuses and
beastlynesse / no natural order observed. Nothing in a manner are the cruel
constytucions made against the Jews by the suggestyon of Aman / and by
Antiochus / to their wicked laws and ordynaunces. For they were only against
the body / theirs are against men's sowles. So that the papysty call
kyngedome of antichrist are to be son both the lion / the Bear / and the
Catte of the mountain / they not only partycypatynge with all unfaithful
regyons / but also doubling with them in all abhomynacyons under the sky. The
mouth they have of a lyo^ / roaryng out evermore blasphemies curses / and
bytternesse. The fea^e of a Bear / sygnyfieth their ravenous affeccyons /
ronninge unto all pernyciouse euyls / ^erye swyft also to the shedynge of
blood.

cencyon.

11 And finallye as concerning auctoryte / like as Christ being manne took
power of God to do soche miracles as non else could do / so ded he of the
devil / being his wreched body to work pro^igyouse maruels and wonders in
hipocrisye among the unfaithful multitude / by the secret sufferaunce of
God. So that in all peruertynge power / supremyte / and auctoryte / he follows
his father Satan / yea / in every point. For like as he depryued simple Job /
a man that feared God / of his substance / catell / children / and
servants / and vexed him in his flesh with most greuouse botches / so does
this gredye leuiathan / this malyciouse murderer / the manne of sin / and
body of the devil / with his devouring locustes / rob the poor people of
their swear / labors / travail / and necessary lyuinge / sparynge neither
sick nor soco^rlesse / poor wydowe nor fatherless / no goods gotten by
thef^e / mannesslawter / extorcyon / bryb^rye / pollage / Idolatrye / bawdrye /
and all other ungodliness coming to them amysse in their private
confessyons. And (that is most to be lamented) they defyle their sowles with
all supersticions / false believe / and deuylishnesse / leaving their
consciences all doubtful / desperate / and confortelesse. Finallye to conclude
/ like as in the body of Christ dwells the whole fullness of the godhede
corporallye / so dwells there in this body of Satan the whole fullness of
falsehede / craft / subtylte / malice / with power to work all manner of
myschef / effectuallye / reallye / substanciallye and corporallye.

The Paraphrase.
1 And one of his heads (says Saint Johan) seemed unto me / as it had been
wounded unto death. And it was not so in deed / for his deadlye wound was
healed again. Euydent it is that in Iohans time / Rome the mother of all who
redome had subject unto her the.vij. clymates or universal parts of the
world / with all their powers / governors / kings / possessions / pompes /
false worshyppinges / and soche like. Whom some writers suppose mete to be
taken here for the.vij. heads of this beast. But I find an other thing in it
/ the body of these.vij. heads being but one / and still contynuynge so. For
thowgh all were at that time under her / yet is it not so now / and yet still
remains this beast. Therefore I do take it for one universal Antichrist (as I
ded before) comprehendynge in him so well Mahomete as the Pope / so well the
ragynge tyrant as the still hypocrite / and all that wyckedlye works are of
the same body. The seven heads of this Beast / may so well be his
presumptuouse doings for the.vij. ages of the church / as any thing else /
and yet no preiudyce done to that has been said before. What should ayle this
wounded head here / not to sygnyfye his supremyte suppressed / his usurped
auctoryte and power dyminihsed / and his whole prodygyouse occupyenge
condemned in this latter age of the church? I suppose nothing more manifes^
/ unless we have eyes and will not se. Are not now in many parts of Germanye
/ and in England also the Popes pardons laid aside? His power put down / his
name abolyshed / his purgatory / pelgrimages / and other peltryes utterly
exyled? and so like to be within short space in other regyons also? If this be
not a deadlye woundynge of one of the Beasts heads / I think there is non.
If this be not an apparent lykelyhode of his fall / there is non to be looked
for.

2 But the healynge again of this mortal wound is like to mar all / and
make the last error worse tha^ the first. In many places where as the gospel
has been preached / the Bishop of Rome deposed / sects shrynes and
sanctuaries destroyed / monasteries / prioryes and fryeryes turned over /
remains still their poison / with those same instruments wherewith they have
wrought all myschef. Still continues their more than Iewyshe ceremonies /
their prestybulouse presthode / their vowynge to have no wives / and their
Sodomyticall chastity. Still remains their sale masses / of all abhominacio^s
the principal / their prodigiouse sacrifices / their sensynge of Idols / their
boyeshe processyons / their uncommanded worshyppinges / and their confessions
in the eat / of all trayterye the fountain / with many other strange
obseruacyons who^ the scripture of God knows not. Nothing is brought as yet
to Christ's clear institucyon and sincere ordinance / but all remains still
as the Antichrystes left it. Nothing is tried by Gods word / but by the
ancient auctoryte of fathers. Now passes all under their title. Thowgh the
old Bishops of Rome were of late years proved Antichrystes / and their names
raced out of owr books / yet must they thus properlye for old acquaytaunce be
called still owre fathers. If it were naught before / I think it is now much
worse. For now are they become lawdable ceremonies / where as before time they
were but ceremonies alone. Now are they become necessary rytes / godly
constitucyons / semelye vsages / and cyuyle ordynaunces / where as before they
had no soche names. And he that dysobeyeth them shall not only be judged a
fellon and worthy to be hanged by their new forged laws / but also
condemned for a traytoure against his king / though he never in his life
hyndred but rather to his power has furdered the common welthe. To se this
also with soche like put in execucyon / the Bishops have auctoryte every
month in the year if they list / to call a sessyon / to hang and borne at
their pleasure. And this is ratyfyed and confermed by act of Perlament to
stand the more in effect. If this be no healynge of Antichrists wounded head
/ never is like to be any. When men shall defend fre will / and allow
their popyshe Mass to be a sacrifyce fatysfactorye for the quycke and the dead
/ latoure they any other (think you) than the healynge of this wounder He
likewise that in an open audyence mainteyneth owr own works to iustifye / by
Dimitte nobis / and other not ryghtlye understood scripturs / does he any
other than prepare a salve for the same? Nay surely. No less also does he
that sets men to open penance at Paul's cross / for holy water making
/ for procession and sensynge with other popetishe gawdes / constraynynge them
to promise the anauncement of the old faith of holy church by soche
fantastical fopperyes / as Bonner bishopp of London ded now of late / to the
lawhynge game and wonderment of all the world. Alas how is the people abused?
Non other do they but mock Christen princes with flatterye / that give them
old popyshe tytles and blasphemouse names of Antichrist. As to call them most
Christen kings and defenders of the catholic faith / meaning the Popes old
tradicions / to heal the head of the beast. This is surely non other / but
with the said Beast to receive auctoryte / seat / and power of Satan. Let
them therefore take heed least they be fownde the same Antichrists that they
have condemned / and so throw them selves double under the same plage.
Necessary it is they beware what they drink / or what tytles they take upon
them at their appointment / least they forgetting them selves be found
dronken by taking excess of the Babylonishe cup / and so peryshe with the
wicked. Mark here dilygentlye this word head / and ye shall well perseyue how
wonderfullye the storye agrees with the mysterye.

3 And all the world (says saint Johan) wondered at the Beast. All folyshe /
carnal / and worldly people / not understanding the wisdom of Gods holy
sprete / depends all upon their beastlye baggage / thinkinge all that they do
to be godly / meritoryouse / and spiritual. They magnifye it / praise it /
and have it in most high estimacion / yea / they have it in much more price
than any thing that is of God. In no wise will they from their old frenesye
/ soche is their exceeding blindness. For when they here tell / their
customs shall continewe / their governors agreynge to the same / they clappe
their hands for Joy / and sing Gaudeamus with the prestes.

4 Yea / they worshypp the Dragon which gave soche power to the Beast: With
their hearts they rejoice trustinge upon longer contynuaunce / when they se his
head restored again in their rewlers / the godly teachers burned / and the
preachers put to silence.

5 They worship also the Beast / so many as worshipped the Dragon. For as they
which worship Christ / worship his father also / so they that worship
Antichrist / agreynge to his laws and decrees / does also worship the devil /
of whom he received his pride. They wonder with the Jews that seeks
cauyllacions to co^tempne Christ's doctrine / as does the filthye familye of
the do^^ynge dodypolles prestes and unlearned lawers. They worship with the
heythen / that admits their power and allows their factes / as does the
folyshe multitude / that never will be godly wise. Non other judgment
remains in these days to these wonderers and worshippers of the newlye
restored head of the Beast / than ded unto them / that with double devotion
agreed to the abhominacions of Mahomete and the Pope.

6 And this will be their saying as follows in the text / spoken in the time
past for the certente of the thing / as the manner of the scripture is.

7 Who is like unto the Beast / in outward glitterynge works / or in the
e^terne obseruacions of counterfett relygyon.

8 Who is able to war with her the worldly powers now so depelye
maynteyninge her quarrel? All seeks the papists that they can in the world
Imagyne / to uphold the glory / magnificence / and bewrye of their holy
whoryshe church / or malignaunt muster. No cautels nor c^aftes leave they
unsought nor vnserched out / to cause the people to esteem her of incomparable
power. No small labor took standyshe in hand in whittington College / when he
made his more than folyshe book of reproach against Barnes being dead. Nor no
less dylygence the wise Poet Johan Hontyngton / when he regestred in his
Genealogye of heretykes without grace / wit / and learning the names only of
soche godly men as were the popes enemies / no heretyke against God ones
me^cyoned. No More ded Thomas Smythe / Richard Dallyson / William Stawne /
Steue^ Prowett / frire Adriane / quarrye the pardoner / with soche other blind
Popish Poets and dirtye metristes / when they uttered their shitten ^ymes and
poesies. And sure I am that many more be yet abroad of the same wicked zele
and sprete / to the great blasphemye both of God and his truth / now that the
Beasts wound is made whole again / by so many new^ acts / so many new
tytled Bishops so fresh sale of benefyces / mastershyppes / and dignitees /
spiritual offices / degrees / and auctorytes / as plentuouse as ever was in
Rome. And least we should be depryued of our new plesaunt Euphrates / and so be
compelled by the word of God to follow the Monks / Chanons / Nonnes / and
friars in their bannyshementes. We have procured serten acts to be made for
our commodyte / and those only to be publyshed among the people ones in a
quarter / or so often as shall please us / to blemyshe all godly preachinges of
the scripturs. Thus seek we our selves and not God / our own stre^gthe and not
his / our own glory and not Jesus Christ's. But let us not think that he
sleapeth with Baall the false God, knowinge the most hydden toughtes of the
heart / but that he will within short space send forth his lyghtenynges and
scatter us / bringing our heythnyshe deuyses to naught. For the kyngedome of
one faith in us and the pope thus manyfestlye in certain points divided / must
surely decay.

The Paraphrase.
1 To this beast (says Johan) was given a mouth / not of God but of Satan /
to speak great mighty things and blasphemies. So well is this spoken of the
one as the other / so many as has done upon the Antichrists lyuerye / title
/ power / auctorite / or name. When the veryte of the lord was opened before
them / they gave no thanks for it / but became vain in their thoughts /
wherefore God gave them over into a lewd mind / darkenynge their hearts. So
that now thynkinge them selves wise / they apere more folyshe than before.

2 Now speak they great things in their conuocacyons seanes and sermons / and
all are sore blasphemies against God and his Crist. Now must they serve God by
most straight commandment with old Romyshe beggerye / though he most hyghlye
abhors it / and no scrypturs may be red in the time thereof. For the
scripturs must only pass as we will have them. How should the Beasts head else
be healed again / or how should our church be known else to be his own Image?
Oh beastlye abhomynacion / and most hellyshe decre. Now must Christ be taken
for no sauer at all without owr deservings. The supper of the lord that was
sumtyme a mutual pertycypacyon of Christ's body and blood / must now be a
new crucyfyenge of him / one traytoure playnge all parts / Judas / Annas
Cayphas / Herod / Pylate / and the Jews. Matrimonye must be judged
uncleanness thowgh it be the ernest institucyon of God. No Popyshe vow may be
dissolved / though it be well known a matter so deuilyshe / as has made an
hondreth thowsande Sodomytes. The Eucharystye may not be received in both
kinds / thowgh it be the express commandment of Christ so to be used.
Without the blind bussynges of a Papyst / may no sin be soluted / for that
is the vpholdynge of their kyngedom / with many other like blasphemies. Certain
other great things are uttered by this mouth / which now I pass over least I
should be tedyouse to the reader. How be it this one great blasphemye that is
spoken / I can not leave vntowched.

Where as they boast themselves yet still alone to be the holy church / by
the only virtue of their vnccyons and shauynges received first of the pope /
the layte secluded. And under this most falselye usurped title / they will
still be taken for the redemers of me^nes sowles. For they say that their
Masses are satysfactorye sacryfyces for the quycke and the dead / iustyfienge /
releuynge / and saving the^ both from dampnacyon / ex opere operato. And over
that abominable swarm of Antichrists filthy mynysters / make they now their
kings the heads most blasphemously / only to be by them vpholden now in all
their myscheues. Truth yt is that a king is the ^polytyque head / supreme
governor / and great stay under God / of the people to his charge committed /
and after that sort / their myghtie monarke also by the scripturs / which they
have before this time denied / worshyppinge them for most holy saints / which
have most presumptuouslye rebelled in that behalf. But over that whoryshe
church of theirs (whom Christ never planted) is Satan the only head / by the
holy Ghostes fore judgments here. For to that beastlye broad gave the Dragon
his power / his seat / and his mighty auctoryte. God forbid therefore that
any Christen prince should at their false suggestyo^s / admit so blasphemouse
a title. The devil (says Job) is the only head over all the children of
pride. That voice therefore may be blasphemouse / as coming from the mouth of
the serpent / if yt be not take good head to.

3 *And power was given to the Beast to do these things for the space of.xlij.
months / which is the.iij. years and an half of Helyas / the time / times /
and half time of Danyell / and the thowsande two hundred and three score days
of Johan. Not only for this age of the church / but also for all other ages /
and by other heads also / has the mouth of this Beast uttered great things
in blasphemy / lies in Hypocresye / and wonders under a deceytfull power. But
as concerning this latter healed head of the Beast / the time thereof will be
short / as here after shall ap^re in the.xvij. chapter.

4 He opened his mouth (says the text) in reproues against God / speaking
ill of his name / of his tabernacle / and of the^ that dwell in heaven. This is
in a manner all one with that was spoken before in the.xi. chapter of the temple
/ the au^ter / and of them that worship in the temple / save only that his
name is here for his temple. In token that when his temple is blasphemed (which
is his co^gregacyon) his name is blasphemed by the same / so is his tabernacle
Jesus / in whom bodily dwells, the fullness of the Godhede / so are also
they that dwell ^n heaven / wherbye is me^t the true church / from whom the
angels are not secluded / being their fellawe servants. These dwellerrs be
they that have their conuersacyon in heaven under an undefiled faith / that
seek those things which are above and not upon earth / that worship the
father in sprete and veryte / and that perseuereth true christyanes to the
end. Many enters this heaven of the lord / but all contynueth not in yt to
the end of their lives / the more is the pity.

5 Power was also given unto this beastlye Antichrist / / to make battle with
the saints / and to overcome them. Contynuallye do they with vyolence vex by
their cer^all polycyes / auctoryte / and laws / the sincere witnesses or
preachers of the lord / sanctyfyed of him through faith in his holy word as
were his Apostles / like as ded the malycyouse clergy of the Iewes-Yea / they
ded resist them with their more than tyrannouse proclamacyons / commissyons /
and commandeme^tes with cruel Pharao / Ama^ / and Antiochus / to prove Christ
in them the sign of contradyccyon and stone of reproach. They seek here / they
honte there / and never leave ragynge till they have closed them up in presons.

6 Yet are they not so contented till they have ouercomen them in the syghe of
the blind world / though not before God. Either shall they be compelled
shamefullye to recante / or if they persyst in the veryte / to suffer most
peynefull death. By one way or other they must be ouercome^ / to hold the
people in error. The Gardyner of wynchester was not ashamed now of late as I
hard yt credyblye reported) to say unto one that was accused of his
malygnaunt multitude / when he was no longar able to withsta^de the manif^st
truth. Master Seyton we know ye are learned / and plentuouslye know ye are
learned / and plentuouslye endued with knowledge in the scripturs / yet think
not that ye shall overcome us. No / no / set your heart at rest / and look
never to have yt said that ye have ouercomen the bishops / for yt shall not
be so. In deed yt is truth. For neither Christ nor his Apostles ded ever yet
overcome you.

Their vyctorye over you is not in this world / your kyngedome being here.
But be certain and sure of yt ye shall be ouercomen to your much more rebuke /
at the latter day when all wrongs and iniuryes shall be revenged / which is
not far of. Your lordelye estymacyon (which may not be hyndred here) will
apere there not very precyouse. Yet do ye well to hold up a proud pecockes
head as long as ye may. Lose not an ynche of your hight hardelye / but with
your gogle eyes look up like a man with a guard at your tail / like a sort
of tormentours in a play. And with your lyenge judgments overcome these
beggerlye vagabondes / and burn them also rather tha^ fail / to fulfill the
measure of your holy fathers.

7 And autoryte was given to this Beast upon every kyndred / people / tongue /
and nacyon. For non these Antichrists spare / neither high nor low / rich
nor poor / sick nor hole / learned nor unlearned. But a iurisdiccyon they must
have over the^ / though yt be usurped. Ones in the year must they have them in
confession / to know which way they are bente. That salve have they gotten in
again / to heal up their wounded head. Be he nary^e or be he stranger / be
he a rewler or be he co^moner / he must obey them no remedy / or else stand
forth at the sessyons with Christ among thieves. Not in one regyon / or where
as one manner of language is used / have they this auctorite / but in every
land / in every shere / in every town / and in every famylye must they
have to do / corruptynge every man's faith.

8 For all that dwell upon earth must worship this Beast. They must agree to
the great things / no remedy. They must blaspheme God as they do. But blessed
be the lord / no^ does that in their hearts but they only that dwell upon the
earth / that have their felycyte here / that seeks the prosperyte of this
world / and regards non other life than therein is. The lambs of Christ's
fold gives head to his voice / they regard his call / they follow his word
/ they walk in his light. They seek for no holiness but only in him /
neither in water nor bread / ashes nor palms / robes nor relyckes / masses nor
anoyntinges. He is their only sufficient wisdom / ryghtousnesse / holiness /
and redemption. His word is their lyuinge water / the fode of their sowles /
the lantern that shall gyde them / and the life that will not fail them. Non
other doctrine do they couete / nor yet other precepts of living. Though they
be here in the earthye / yet dwell they not upon yt. No contynuynge cite have
they here / but they seek unto an other of much more bewtye and pleasure / not
builded of men. And for that they are redye rather to render by their lives /
than to renounce the very^e. Only they which dwell here does worship the
Beast / louinge themselves better than God / and their flesh better than his
truth / having their whole trust in the mangye merits and dyrtye deservings
of these beastlye Hipocrites / and no thing at all in his sweet promyses.

9 And therefore are not their names written of the la^be in the book of life /
which lamb was slain from the beginning of the world. Christ has not
allowed them by his word and promise. With the ryghtouse are they not regestred
/ as members of one mystycall body in him. In the similitude of his death are
they not grafted unto him as the branches unto the vine / to be partyners of
his resurreccyon. Their porcyon is not in the land of the living with him.
They are non of those / whom the father has given him / to partycipate with
him in one sprete. Predestynate they are not unto life by him / nor so written
up in the foreknowlege of God. Chosen they were not of the lord before the
worlds constitucyo^ / to be his undefiled children in Crist.

10 He is the meke lamb that was slain. He alone takes away the sins of
the world. In him only is the life / for he is the life yt self. Yet is he
the life of no^ other / but of those that only believe in him.

11 In that he was killed from the worlds beginning / is sygnifyed / that he
dyed for all them which were create to be saved / and that his only death is
all their health / raise / and remedy / by the promise of God. For all they
have eaten of one spyrytuall meat / and drunk of one spyrytuall rock /
though yt came in the flesh long after them. He only trod down the head of
the Serpent. Se^s the beginning has he been slain in his members also / as
manyfes^ yt is ^n ryghtouse Abell / Hyeremy / Johan Baptist / and soche other
like. They that are not written of the lamb in the book of life for the
children of God / are regestred in the book of death for the children of
perdycyo^ / reserved to eternal death for their infydelyte / with the devil
and his angels.

12 He that has an ear (says the text) let him take good head. He that has
an understanding / let him be admonyshed / by that which follows here. Or he
that has received the wisdom of the sprete / let him judge hereof according
unto yt. Thus does the holy Ghost aduertyse the faithful to consider / that
what so ever things are written / they are written unto owr lerninge.

13 He that leads into captivity / shall go into captivity. And he that
kylleth with a sword must with a sword be slain. This warninge gives the
lord / take it if they list. For he will have his right judgments known. He
that vexes or afflicts the just beleuers in body by outward ponnishme^ts /
he shall be afflicted in the sprete with an inward darkness or blindness
of the soul / that he may be the more captive to sin and to Satan. God
will deliver him up into a lewd mind / and will give him strong delusion /
to believe al manner of lies / that he might be dampened.

14 He that kills the poor innocent for his faith with the pro^swerde / or
sleeth him with any other torment / with the sword of the sprete (which is
the lords word) shall he be both judged and condemned. The word that I have
spoken (says Christ) shall judge them at the latter day. And this is in manner
all one with that was said in the.xi. chapter before. If any manne will hurt
the^ / fire shall proceed out of their mouths / and consume their enemies.

15 Nevertheless to the christian is persecucion necessary. For here in this
life is the patience of the saints proved / and their faith required. Here
was Abraham tempted and Job sore vexed / and both they were found Good true
faithful servants. Here were the Apostles contempned / reioysinge that they
were found worthy for Christ's sake to suffer rebuke. The rightouse the lord
tries as gold in the furnace. He chasteneth every servant that he loves /
and scourges every son that he receives. Only is it faith that all the
euyls of this world by patience overcomes / and so obtayneth the victory.
The fruit which rises to eternal life / is peaceable sufferaunce in faith.
And that must be here in this life / where as we are vnperfight / to make us
perfight.

The Paraphrase.
1 And I beheld (says saint Johan) in this secret reuelacyon of my lord /
an other Beast arysynge out of the earth. A figure is this of all false
Prophets and ungodly preachers. Beastlye are they evermore / vain / carnal
/ and corrupt in their stodyes / abominable in the pract^synges of their
wicked hearts / not sehinge God but their bellyes / not Christ's glory but
their own pride and vain glory.

2 From the earth they arise / all given to earthlye wisdom. The only
affectes of this world does move the^ to teach / and no good zele of the
truth. Either are they tyckled with ambytion / prycked with auaryce / or else
sturred with malice to inueye. These are the common affectes of the wicked.
This going up have they from wickedness to wickedness and shall have still
till the lord destroy the^ / like as have the just beleuers from vert^ to
virtue in the sprete / till soche time as they see him face unto face in the
everlasting Syon. From the worlds beginning has this Beast risen up in Cayn
the first murderer / in the fleshelye children of men / in Cham the
shameless child of Noe / in Ismael and Esau / in Iannes and Iambres / in
Balaham and Baals prophets / in the Beniamytes and Bells chaplaynes / in
Phassur and Semeins / in Judas / Annas and Cayphas / in Barichu and Diotrephes.
And now sens their time most of all in Mahumetes doctors and the Popes
queresters. Yea / still they are aloft in their beastlye beggerye / and will be
till their mysschef be fynyshed. Who sees not now adays that has light in
the sprete / the malygnyte / Hypocresye / haw^e / craft / and deceyt / in
serte^ false Prophets at Paul's cross in London / and in other places else.

3 This Beast had.ij. horns like the la^be at (...) blushe / but all
counterfett and false in very deed / for he spoke as ded the Dragon. The
horns of Christ / are his high kyngedome in the word. Only aryseth his
church by faith in the glad tidings and promysys of God. That word is the
scepture of Christ's power / and the rod of right order where as he regneth.
Non other strange scepturs are there / neither tradycyo^s nor customs. Seven
horns had Christ / for in him was the fullness of the veryte. This Beast has
but two / and yet they are but false and cou^terfe^t. They seem to be Christ's
ad are not. These are the corrupted letter of the.ij. testame^tes / falselye
interpreted / and for a carnal purpose alleged. And therefore yt is but apparent
/ Hypocrityshe / and deceytfull / yea and clean repugnaunt to the lords
meaning / not having the judgment of his sprete. This letter without the
holy Ghost is death / and nothing perteyneth unto Christ. He is the veryte
and life / this is but a fable or fyccyon. His word is sprete and life / this
is but a brass pot sowndynge / or a latten candelstick, tynkelynge /
fantastycall and ^aynt / sophistycall and slayghtye. Though these seem like
Christ's / yet are they non of his / but the very horns of the Beast. For
they uphold Antichrists kyngedome and not his / a worldly glory and not his
/ for his kingedome is not of this world. No longar are they his words / his
laws / nor his testimonies tha^ they maynteyne his right honor No newlye
practysed worshyppynges allows he for his / but utterly abhors the^ all
as things raw and unsavory.

4 And therefore yt follows / that this Beast spoke as ded the Dragon. The
doctrynes and teachynges of these false Apostles and deceytfull masters / are
lies in Hipocresye / and the very doctrine of deuyls / under title of the
veryte repugnaunt to the same. Not unlike to that the Serpent said unto the
woman / ye shall not dye if ye eat of the forbidden fruit / but ye shall be
surely as Gods / knowinge both good and evil. They do as ded Satan in the
desert. Always they persuade us / either of stones to make bread / or else to
throw our selves down ward / or else to worship the devil. That is / to
change the good creaturs of God from their right use / as trees into Idols /
sylkes / veluettes clothe / gold / and silver into superstyciouse ornaments /
chaste Marryage into stynkynge whoredom and Sodomye with soche like. To declyne
from the dewtyes commanded of God to their Idle obseruacyo^s / so making his
commandments of non effect for the bayne tradycyons of men. And fynallye
to fall unto forbidden worshyppynges or abhomynacyons of Idolatrye / of whom
they are full. And for these they have with Satan also their mangled scripture
to lay for the^ / to prove that the help of dead saints is necessary /
their masses / merytes / and works more than need / expedyent / and the fire
of purgatory a fearful thing with the devil and all of soche fantasyes.
These are the prelates of Antichrists church / the.i^. horned monsters or
great bellyed Bishops / rightly described here of the holy ghost in this
two horned beast. These beastlye bushardes are not ashamed both to say and to write / that in their myters they bear the figure of both testamentes / whose
veryte they impugn with ^o^he and nail. Very truly they say / that they
carrye the figure for in deed yt is but a shaddowe they bear. Not to gloryfye
God / but their own beastlye bodies with gold / pearl / and stone / like
Mahownde^ in a play / for his truth they most cruellye persecute. These are
the very false Prophets / the instruments of Satan / the deceyuers / wolves
/ wagelynges / Iudasses / dreamers / liars / Idols / adversaries / adders
whelps / foxes destroyenge the lords vyneyarde / deceytfull workemenne /
desperate shepeherdes / blind watchemenne / dumme dogs / deuyls incarnate /
wicked sede / vnsaciate beasts / whose God is their bealy and glory their
confusyo^. To all these and to many other soche does the Holy Ghost compare
them / for that they have with their errors and lies turned the swetnesse of
the scripturs into bytternesse / scarselye leaving one place thereof undefiled
with their filthy dregs.

5 This Beast (says Saint Johan) ded all things that the first Beast could
do / even be fore his own face. The same lyenge power to deceive in Hypocresye
has this beastlye broad that the great Antichrist has / the same wylye
crafts / and the same beastlye kinds of Idolatrye / and so does use the^. The
same abhominacyons maynteyne they the world over / that the pope maynteyneth
at Rome / and Mahomete in barbarye of Turkeye. Yea / the same supersticyons and
sorceryes / the same execrable tradycions and beggeryes. The same ceremonies
have they / that he has / the same vnccio^s / the same orders / and the same
Masses. The same idle obseruacions with unknown cloynynge / clatteringe / and
wawlinge are still used in England / like as they were used before / and with no
less blasphemy to God.

6 To do soche things in the first Beasts presence / is to do them where his
power and auctorite is raygnynge / or where as is the seat of Satan / which
is every place that admits strange worshippinge.

7 Both the earth and them that dwell in the earth compel they to worship
this first Beast. Not only enforce they the^ to wicked Idolatrye / that never
would know the truth / but also many of those which has great knowledge in
the same. Oh / how many are in England / and in other regions also that in
these days works against faith / knowledge / and the holy ghost /
admittinge the prestes abhominacio^s? Rather had they to dwell still in the
earthlye beggerye with the blasphemye of God / tha^ either to be out of fauer /
or to loose there offices to have their goods hindered / or to hasarde their
lives / so sweet are these wa^ton worldly pleasurs. Rather had they to peryshe
with the sons of Hel^ and Samuel for abusing the ordinances of the lord /
and with Core / Dathan / and abiron for rebellinge against them to synke unto
hell / than with Christ to take peynes in pouerte. But let not them think to
be worthy of Christ / that better loves their own carnal commodyte / than
his heavenly veryte.

8 Well / the Beast must they worship whose wound is made whole. His old
rustye rewles new bournished / and his old Romish rags new patched / by a
newlye confermed auctorite / must they enbrase in pain of death. The lamb
shall not yet be suffered to apere. Still for a time must these terrible
te^magau^tes have more worship tha^ God / their traditions preferred to his
most pure word. And why should it not be so? have they not now a new
reformed church / in whom the Beasts wounded head is newlye restored? So
long as it is like the popes church / it must follow his rewles / and cleave
to his ordynaunces. It shall not follow Christ in faith and in doctrine / till
it apere like that church which he left here behind him when he ascended. And
that is not like to be yet.

9 First must there be wrought great wonders. Fire must be compelled to come
down from heaven in the^ sight of men / by this twohorned Beast. The
discyples of Antichrist with their byfurked ordinaries must violentlye pluck^
from the true christen church (whose regne is not of this world) the eternal
word of the lord.

10 Then must they take from them the consumyge fire that Christ sent down
into the earth of me^nes hearts to dry up all malice and sin. Yea / they
must deprive them of the cloven fyerye tongues / which the holy ghost poured
upon the Apostles / to the confort of all the world. The treasure that Christ
has left here to socoure us / they must hyde under the ground / and the
candle that he light us to se over the house / co^uaye underneath the bushel.

11 And these wonders shall they work in the presence of men. All redye have
they taken in England / from the Bybels / the annotacions / tables / and
prefaces / to perform this their dampnable enterprise. They have streyghtlye
forbidden the reading thereof / for time of their Romyshe service. Some have
they burned / and some put to silence / and all in the face of the people. Yea /
they raised the maids of Ipp^swhy^e and of kente to work wonders and maruel^
/ and now of late the folyshe North^n men to fight for their church. What
practyses they have had in that ear / and that ear / to fetch away the true
favorers and preachers of the Gospel at diverse times / he that well
considers / may say that the holy ghost has here ryghtlye described the^
/ calling the^ workers of wonders. The discrete cytezen of London master
Packyngton was slain with a gonne at saint Thomas of Acres (as they call it)
not without their preuyelegerdemayne. But this with other of their miracles I
intend to declare more at large / in an other treatise the lord lendynge me
life. It is not long ago also sens Alexander Seyton an excellent learned manne
with poor master Tolwyn / recanted at Paul's cross. Nor yet long before sens
good do^tour Crome was compelled to do the same. And now last of all / to take
the scripture clean away / they have sought out great fawtes in the
translacyon of it / and thereupon taken them away from the common peples
reading. Great peynes they take to put it down / but they never swerr yet in
the setting up of yt. Thus mind they to work their wonders / till they have
buried it all in the earth. They lack now but.iiii. knights to hyre / to
keep yt down still / that it rise no more up. O very (...) of hell / and
lymmes of the devil / how vain are your stodyes / and how wicked your
practyses? I have no doubt but within short space God will destroy the
counsels / and dyssypate the strengthes of them that please me^ne. Yet let no man maruele though they do these feats for the time. For if the gospel were
taught without check / in a while* should nothing remain of that generacyon /
neither myter nor rochet / shaven crown nor anoyntinge / and that know they
well enough. For the word of the lord is the breathe of his mouth that shall
destroy them / and the deuowringe fire that shall consume the^.

12 By the means of these signs (says the text) which this Beast had power
to do in the sight of the other Beast / or where his abusio^s does reygne with
outchecke / he deceived the^ that dwelt on the earth. Many in this age are
wo^derfullye abused / through the dysseytful workinge of Satan in these
horned. whoremongers / but yet non other than are earthlye minded. Of some
men in deed the eyes are bleared with their crafts / of some men the weak
judgments blemyshed with their subtiltees / for want of dyscernynge the
scripturs. Some me^ne are tangled with doubts / some trobled with terror /
some tormented with fear / consideringe that for this new learning (as they
will have yt called) some have been hanged / as were the three poor young men
of Sothfolke for the rotten rode of Douercourt / Some burned / some be headed
for things of naught / as is known to all the world These things daseth
their wits / and amaseth their minds. And earth is the cause of all this.
Were yt not that they much more loved this worlds pleasures than Godt / it
should never be so.

13 All the perswasyons of Antichrists prelates and preachers has evermore
been / and are now still unto soche earthlye inhabitauntes / that they should
make an Image like unto this Beast. Which is always to chose soche an Emproure
with other worldly governors as shall be for their commodyte. He must by the
worldly people be compelled to take autoryte / sceptur / and crown at their
hands / so sworn to maynteyne their fleshelye libertees. He must also be
fashioned by their wicked doctrynes and false counsels in confessions / like
them in all superstyciouse living / and in the tyrannouse murder of innocent
Christen men. Where soche an head Ruler is appointed / there is his own
figure made / and where soche a Governor is constitute / there is his own
Image se^ up. For we must consider that this reuelacio^ is in all points no
storye / specially here / as many writers have thought it to be / in
supposing an Antichrist to be borne at the latter end of the world. But it
is a misterye comprehendinge in it but one general Antichrist for all / which
has reigned in the church in a manner sens the Ascencyon of Christ. And in this
one point are all the comme^tours that I have seane / most fowlye deceived /
yea / the best learned of them. I know well if there be any yet to come / he
shall be but a member of this. Again to owr purpose.

14 Specially must they make a right Image of that Beast / which had the
wound of a sword and ded live. This betokens that in these days they shall
stir about them / and leave no ca^tels unsought / neither any false counsels
vnfet from other realms / to do their feats with / and to fashyon the
Christian Governors to their minds. As winchester ded the last time he was in
France. After whose coming home / many great wonders were wrought in
England / and fire was made to come down from heaven. Consider the storye
before / for the storye declares the misterye. That wounded head now healed /
must be up holde^.

15 He had a greuouse wype with the ^worde (which is the living word of the
lord) when he lost his monks / chanons and fryres / his purgatory /
pilgrimages / and shrynes. Yet was he not all dead. For thowgh their cowles /
coctes / and ro^hettes were of yet had they still the same popyshe hearts and
the same super^^iciouse frowardenesse / that they were wont to have. This
might have been found true / if it had been serched / w^an serten popish
prestes of mastre whartons retinue not far from Bongaye in Sothfolke ded
calke for Cromwell and for other else, if the world had no^ ^ha^ged to their
minds. I write not this thinknyge they can harm by the^e calkinge where as
faith is reside^t / but only to show / that their hearts are yet alive and
how virtuously they are occupied. Many things I consider at this instaunt
point co^cerninge prince Edward / who^ I doubt not but the lord has sent
for the singular comfort of England. Not that I ^em^rously diffiue / any
thing to come co^cerninge him / co^sideringe it only in the lords power. But
I desire the said lord to preserve his bringinge up / from the co^tagiouse
drinks of these false phisicianes. And this is to be prayed for of all me^ne /
if ye po^der well the text / and mark their wonderful workinges / where the
beasts head is restored.

The Text.
1 And he had power to give sprete unto the Image of the Beast. 2. and to make
that the Image of the Beast should speak. 3. and should cause that as many as
would not worship the Image of the Beast / should be killed. 4. And he made all
/ both small and great / rich and poor / free and bond. 5. to receive a
mark in their right hands. 6. or in their fore heads. 7. And that no man
might bye and sell. 8. save he that had the mark. 9. or the name of the
Beast. 10. either the nombre of his name.

The Paraphrase.
1 For power they have to give sprete to the Image of the Beast. It is surely
given them of the devil / when they have ones fashyoned out the Beasts right
Image / or made of an Emproure a tyr^^^t / or set in the place of a godly
governor / (...) murderer up of gods people / by flatteringe praises to
encorage them to all my chief / and by wicked counsel to prycke the^ forewarde
to make cruel acts of murder for vpholdynge their beastlye genera^yon. The
sprete that they do ministre unto princes evermore / is not the correccyo^ of
sin / the amendment of life / redress of the common welthe / prouisyon for
the poor / nor the seeking of Gods glory. But by flattering praises to
uphold the^ in their euyls / much after this soort of speakinge. Your
magestes or graces are called most virtuous / most valeaunt / most worthy /
most wise / most mighty and best learned among all Christen potentates. They
are all but Asses / in comparyson to your worthynesses. If yt be your magestes
pleasurs to do this or that within your own domynyon / who shall be so bold
to withstand you? No / though Gods holy laws be an hundred times against yt.
Support the old relygyon of holy church against te Heretykes / and ye can
not chose but prospere in all your affairs. Let it be treason against your
own persons according to the acts of the Emperor Sigysmundus and of king
henrye the fifth / if they do but ones speak against be^ corrupt customs. Make
cruel co^st^^uc^ons apace and proclaim the^ abroad to show your selfs the
popes lively Images.

2 Our office it is to cause the Beasts Image to speak. Let therefore your
voices be hard. Be no dumme Idolles* but speak with bold stomakes. In his
sprete make vtteraunce without Gods word of his old Romish rewles. Send
forth your proclamacions to be publyshed every where / concerning his masses
/ his confessions / his ceremonies and his whorishe chastity. Let all things
be blown forth under your tytles / names / and auctoritees / to be observed
under pain of death. If other realms report that ye abuse the duty of
heysers or kings (which is the office of God esteem not their saynges / but
stand well in your own consaytes. Interpret the scripturs at your own lust
and pleasurs as your law master of Rome has done before your time.

3 Cause so many to be killed / as will not worship the Image of the Beast /
or obey soche wicked laws against the veryte of God / as has been made by
those Emprours that were the popes eldest sons / by the kings of France
which were his younger sons / or by other princes else which were the defenders
of his church / let no^ escape your ^a^des that inueyheth against our
kingdom / but make havoc of them on every side as of heretykes and traitors
/ to prove the holy ghost true here in his fore iudgemente^. For that is your
office / not appointed of God but of Satan. And in our co^mssiyon from him
also we have it / to be no slack mouers of you thereunto. So has Christ told
before in this reuelacyo^ unto saint Ioha^ the Evangelist. This is the ghostlye
counsel that we the horned Beasts / thus have in commission to give unto you
from the mouth of the Dragon. Wha^ soche an Image or Id^louse prince is thus
vpset or co^stytuted by auctorite (his oath ones made that he shall always
defend them) he may in no wise speak but out of that sprete that their
co^iurers / confessors I should say / have put in to him. He may make no
laws but at their spiritual appoyntme^t / like as the Emprour Carolus does now
in these days. Much after this sore became the e^prour Nero this beasts
Image immediately after Cristes asce^sio^ by the subtle slaightes of that
spiritual sorcerer Simo^ Magus / at Rome to withstand the Christen preachers
Peter and Paul / as largelye witnesses Egesippus in his third book de
Hierosol^moru^ exci-dio / the second chaptre. This Simo^ Magus by flatteringe
praises crepte first into his fauer / promisinge him health / long life /
increace of power / and enlargement of his empire / with co^tynuall vyctorye
over his enemies / in case he would follow his counsel / upon this became he /
not only his chief cou^sellour / but also the high bishop of his soul and
conseruatoure of his body / the preseruacyon of his whole health and life to
him committed only. All things after that was done vy his counsel to stop
the Apostles preaching / he taken for the Emprours most familyar frynde / and
a man most profitable to the common welthe of the Romans / and they sone
after suppressed and putt unto most cruel death.

4 And he made all (says Saint Johan) both great and small / rich and poor /
free and bond / to receive a mark in their right hands / or in their fore
heads. Wha^ this new raised Image of the Beast / or sworn power to
Antichrist / is ones raised up or admitted by their autoryte / be he king or
Reyser / prince or other potentate / he must strongelye defend that Synagoge
of the devil / with whole mageste / crown / and scepture. By their only
counsel must he than make laws (for they must give him sprete) and send out
commandementes abroad that their holy decrees be obseued. Commissioners and
vysy^ours must out under that autoryte / as well to the clergy as layte. Than
must all be sworn to it and so obey yt / both high and low / both Gentylman
and ye man / both owner and farmer / both zytezen and townesman / both
merchande and plowgh man / both mastre and servant / both natyue dweller and
denyson. Yea / both Prystes in their colleges / Monks in their abbayes /
Chanons in their couentes / and friars in their cloisters must after their
sort do the same. This rewle has been always for the co^modyte of that
kingedome / where as the powers have been thus by them perverted. Much were it
to show the manyfolde examples in that behalf. Charles the.v. now e^proure /
to make this good / and to show himself to be the said Beasts Image / caused
soche acts to be publyshed through out his whole domynyon against the Christen
doctrine / wherein all they are declared heretyques / scysmatyques / and
excommunicates / which takes not the pope for sayn^ Peter's only vycar and
head of the christen church / non excepted / neither king nor Coruester / as
there are now diverse of the contrary opinion. The artycles of the louanyanes
under his pryuilege / and the acts of the parysyanes vudre the frenc^e kings
autoryte / proclaimed in this present year of our lord A.M.CCCCC.xlv. will
make all this matter good.

5 And what is this else both in their clergy and commons / but to receive a
mark in their right hands or forehea^es? for in admittynge those artycles and
acts / they grant to obey those blasphemouse doctrynes that shall both
corrupt their life and faith / both their works and conseyence. For in
consentinge unto errors in their faith / they spott their foreheades /
having so their consciences marked with an hot iron. In full granting also
to do them in effect / they defyle their hands / perfourminge soche works as
are vnpure before God. If they were gone quyte from Christ that wrapped them
selves again with the works of the law appointed of God before his coming
/ much more are they gone from him that tangle them sel^es with soche works
of bondage as he never knew / as are all their Idell obseruacions having no
express commandments of the word of God. Only look we (says Paul) in
sprete to be iustyfied through faith / which by love is mighty in operacyon.

6 And for them that so believes is this disiunctyue or / put betwyn their
hands and foreheades. For all they that outwardlye keep these heythnishe
obseruacyons / have not their conscyences defiled with them / for their inward
faythes sake / though they perform the outward works / doubting the
terror of the laws. Yet would I counsel them not therein to trust / but at
the word of the lord to go from it. For though loath dwelt in Sodom / yet at
the lords voice he departed from thens.

7 This Image made also that no ma^ne might vye or sell / save he only that
had the Mark or the name of the Beast / or at the least the nombre of his
name. The acts of Iustynyane the Emproure / shall make this good / so shall
the constitucyons of Adelstane and Edgare and many other kings here in
England which for the order and commody^e of the clerge made many polytyque
laws. Specyallye king Inas Governor of the west Saxons / which first gave
the Peter Pens unto Rome / and made him self a monk there. But in this
spyrytuall generacyon among them selves / is non allowed for a merchande
unless he come in by Symonye. Non was made bysshopp / pastoure / nor ^urate /
but paid for it their taxed sommes / bishops / to the pope / and the prestes
to the byshopps / besides Irem in brybes.

Non might else be allowed to utter to advantage the wares of the beast / or
distribute the rytes of that holy whoryshe church.

8 Neither were any made free of that mart / unless they had the mark of
the beast / which is not only the outward sign of their head shauinge and
anoyntinge of their fingars / but also the inward prynte of their consciences
/ received by profession made to that wicked monster. For like as true faith
in Jesus Christ is the mark of a perfygh^ christian / so is a false believe in
popish tradicions a token of Antichrists member. By their fruits (says
Christ) shall ye know them. For the one follows the rewle of Gods word / the
other has counterfeit works of men's prescripcion.

9 Else must they have the name of the Beast / to be called spyrituall men /
or the holy consecrate nombre / as his holy fatherhode is called.

10 Or at the least they must have the no^bre of his name / which is a note of
magnificence and worthynesse. Less ca^ they not be called than lords / so
many as are sworn to that spiritual markett. The most ragged ronegate / and
idle ydiote among them / is no less tha^ a ^yre / which is a lord in the
Lattyn / as sir Johan / sir Thomas / sir Willyam. In the Lattyn only hangs
their great lordeshippes. Among their unknown lattyn hours / their masses /
and their dyrigees / lies their plentuouse patrimonye in their portasses and
mass books. No^ he that leaves all with poor peter / may be called from
fishynge / nor with Matthew from the custom house / to do these offices. But he
that catches all with Judas and Simon Magus must come from Symonye to do them.
Not he that is called of God as was Aaron shall have cure of soul / but he that
offers to Corban with Annas and Cayphas. Soche a world has it been and is
ye^ still in the world abroad among them.

The Paraphrase.
1 Here is wisdom to be had (says saint Johan. Let him that has wit /
count the nombre of the Beast / for it is the Nombre of man. And his Nombre
is six hundred / sixty and six.

2 For so much as Christ has willed us diligently to search the scripturs /
and the holy Ghost here does committ the judgment of this secret to the
wit of man / some writers has deducted this Number out of serten Greek
words / betokeninge this great Antichrist / because this present Reuelacion
was first written in the Greek language. As out of antemos / which signifies
one contrary to Gods honor / out of Arnume / which signifies a denyer of
God / and out of Teitan / which betokens the sun. All these.iii. vo^ables /
though they seem diverse / yet contain they after the Greek rewles / neither
more nor less than this set Number. And all this may stand both with
scripture and reason. For he that is not with Christ / is against him /
calling that is good ill / and that is ill good / mynystrynge darkness for
light. Soche lyenge masters as has brought in sects of perdicyon / has
denied the lord that bought them. They are not the light as they boast
themselves to be (for all they look to be called spyrituall) but they are the
fallen Stars and very Apostaraes from God / and Satha^s tra^sfonemynge
themselves into the angels of light by diverse kinds of Hypocresye.

3 Some expositours leaving the Greek / has practysed the same thing by
these.ii. latyne words. Dic lux / contaynynge in numerall letters the same
set^ No^bre. Which sygnifyed that they call them selves the light / or men of
a spyrytuall sort / being nothing less. For they in deed are the same self
darkness that will in no wise receive the light / but rather persecuteth yt
with most spyg^t and cruelte. After this sort might I bring in Diabolus
incarnatus / or filius perdictonis / the devil incarnate or the son of
perdycyo^ / for both they are the names of this beastlye Antichrist by the
scripturs / the one wantynge in the numerall letters but.iiii. of the No^bre /
and the other but.vi. which might be supplied in the other letters. But a monge
all these this word Arnume most nyghlye towcheth the my^erye / which is as
much to say / as I deny. Euydentlye seems he to have the mark of the Beast
/ or to be sealed with the Nombre of his name / that says when he hears the
manifest veryte / I will never admit ye while I have a day to live / it is
against good order / yt stands not with laudable custom / our doctors agree
not th^^ unto / our holy canons allows yt not / yt has not the holy
fathers consent / (...) us pray^ and hope / for it has great likelyhode of a
much farther apperaunce.

^ Sens the worlds beginning have the misterye of iniquite wrought in Ca^n
and in his posteryte / and so continued in the Beastlye members of Antichrist
and so shall do still to the latter day. Therefore is yt no less than the
Nombre of man / six hundred sixtye and six. Thus is he tokened with all
wickedness / that admits the false faith of this Beast / and follows the
same in his living by the subtle perswasyons of the Bishops and their lyenge
Prophets / and is sealed up to eternal dampnacyon / unless the lord call
him in time. Not only in England is healed the beasts wounded head / but
also in other serten regyons. But for so much as yt is most lyuelye done there
/ and this book written in that language / I have only brought forth here
examples thereof in that purpose.

The.xiiii. Chapter.
IN this present chapter declares the lord unto Johan / and unto his
faithful servants by him / the degree / estate / and condycyon of his true
beleuynge church / now after he has before lyuelye described the bestyall
church of Antichrist and of his horned spyritualte by the before named.ii.
mo^struouse Beasts. And this is that his lovers should know what they be which
are of his howsholde / and what an helper they have of him in the mids of
their aduersitees / to the confort of their sowles. And though they be here a
monge those ragynge tyrauntes in terryble agonyes and peynes / persecucions and
trobles / he is never absent from them / nor will not be till he has rewarded
them with unspeakable Joys.

The Paraphrase.
1 I ^oked (says saint Johan) on the other side / and in a thought as it were
/ I beheld that a lamb stood upon mount Syon. Even the lamb of God Jesus
Christ / that alone took away the sins of the world. Alone does he govern
his faithful church / as the only and immediate head thereof / having non
other to assist him in that office. For who is the king over Syon but he? Who
shall reduce Israel again to his fold but he? Only is he with his
congregacyon / to aid them with his word / to bolden them with his sprete /
and to stre^g^then them with his grace.

2 And with him were present an hondreth and.xliiij. thousand / having his
fathers name written in their fore heads. So many as have in heart received
his word / and in faith digested his ve^e / are the very children of Abraham
/ and are marked up for the sons of God by the seal of the holy Ghost.

3 For power have they given the^ to be Gods children that believe in his name.
And this is yt to have his name written in their fore heads. For their faith
declares them Gods sons. Let this set Nombre be non impediment to the
reader / to be taken here for the universal multitude of the faithful / as
well of the Gentiles as of the Jews that believes / though yt otherwise
apereth in the.viii. chapter of this book. For so well is the Gentile that has
faith / a perfyght Israelyte, / as is the Christen Jew. Yea / much rather
was. Zacheus for his faith judged Abraham's child / than was Simon for
fulfyllynge the works of the law. For God is not parcyall. What so ever he be
that fears him / and works ryghtousnesse / is accepted with him. And so is
yt meant here. And therefore is not the difference written here as in the other
place / but all is Joined in one / to co^prehe^de all under one. And as
touching the equal certente in Nombre both here and there. Like as yt is
ther^ certeynlye known unto God / even so is yt here / though yt be unto us
both innumerable and uncertain. Not as concerning the Nombre yt self / but
the common understanding thereof in the scripturs. For if the Nombre of one
seventh be an infinite Nombre there / much more of many seuenthes.

4 And I hard a voice from heaven (says Saint Johan) which is all one with
the aforeseyd Syon / and is the universal congregacyon of Christ / all clear
from the superstycyons af men. For / from Syon comes the law of the lord
after Esaye / and the word of God from Jerusalem.

5 This word is as the noise of many waters / when yt is in the mouths of
many diverse peples / of diverse natyons and languages / one not
understanding an other / and yet knowing yt yche people among themselves.

6 Very like is yt also to a great tho^der crack / mighty / fear full / and
terrible to the flesh. Very hard is thy word lord (said Christ's disciples)
who is able to abide yt.

7 And the voice that I hard (says Ioha^) was much after the noise that the
harpers make when they play upon their harpes. Full of agreement are the holy
scripturs / yea / full of sweet hermonye and concord. More precyouse are the
verytes of the lord than is gold / and their melodye more sweet than honye.

8 With them reioysed David before the ark of the lord. In the^ took Paul a
stomach / and confounded the Jews at Damas^us.

9 And swetelye they vttred with their voices a song that seemed all new /
before the seat of the lord / before the.iiii. Beasts / and before the
auncye^t elders. This song is the word of the lord / all new both to the
good and to the ill. The faithful it renews in the sprete of their minds /
provoking them to do on a new ma^ne in Christ. The hearts of the unfaithful
it so hardens / that they in disdain and spyght does call it new learning /
as ded the ignorant multitude at Capernaum / and the worldly wise men of
Athenes.

10 Before the seat of the lord was this song vttred / which is the godly
disposed multitude. For like as the heart of an hipocrite is the very seat of
satan / so is the heart of a faithful manne the seat of God and habitacle of
the holy Ghost.

11 Before the.iiii. Beasts was it opened also by this number of godly
teachers. Which Beasts are the pryuate congregacions of the lord / remayninge
here yet in the flesh / in the.iiii. quarters of the world.

^^ Finallye before the elders was it song also. For non other doctrine is it
/ nor Gospel of glad tydinges / than has been sens the beginning / nor tha^
has been thankefullye received of owr old auncetours the Patriarchs / the
Prophets / the Apostles / and the faithful fathers.

13 And no man could learn that new song / but the aforesaid hundred and
xliiii. thousand / which were redeemed from the earth. On mighty / wonderful
/ yea and terrible sentence of the lord. Non that take them selves for the
people of God / ca^ be accepted before him for the true sede of Abraham / nor for
the just ministers of his word / unless they betokened before with the holy
sprete of his promise / and so predestinate to the life everlasting.

14 Non can syncerelye do that godly office to the profight of other / unless
he be whollye taken from all fleshlye and worldly affectes. No man can
come unto me (says Christ) unless it be given him of my father.

15 The wilful Jews believed not because they were not the sheep of his mark.
Neither is it of him that wills no^ of him that ronneth but of the only
martyr of the lord. Necessary is it therefore that his sprete draws moves /
and in^meth the heart. Else can not the song be sweet / neither in him that
sings nor yet in the hearer. The notes of this new song are Gods heavenly
verytees / regestred in the faithful hearts.

16 And they that ded sing them to the praise of the lord / were not defiled
with women. With no strange doctrynes / nor yet Profane worshyppynges is
their faith contamynate / that unfeignedly have done on Jesus Christ. No^ the
spowsage of their sowles have they broken by no filthy tradicyons of me^ne.
Only have they with David sought the Testymonyes of God / and thought non like
unto them. Only ded they cleave to his precyouse laws / estemynge all other
but chafe / and very whoredom in the sprete.

17 Therefore are they virgins married unto Christ in faith / as were the
Corynthyanes by Paul's preaching / whom he wyshed to continewe a chaste virgin
unto Christ. Never is the maydenhede of the soul lost / till erronyouse
doctrine be received from the massengers of Antichrist the Bishops and
Hipocrites.

18 The virgins / or uncorrupted beleuers does follow the lamb whersoeuer he
becomes. They go after Christ / that beleuynge his word / does fashion their
lives unto yt. Like as they follow Antichrist / that fashion their works to
his doctrine. They walk in his steps / that forsake themselves with him /
that bears the cross of persecucyo^s with him / or that suffers death for
the truth with him. And not they that seek themselves / living here in all
pomp / voluptuousness / and Tyranny. From this place fatche the blind
Papists / a great argument for their wyuelesse chastyte / and that no^
follows Christ but they in this muster / because they are unmarried. Neither
may Abraham / Moses / nor David / Zacharye / Peter / nor Philip / walk in
this No^bre / because they had wives. So parelouse a thing yt is to have a
wife. It is great maruele they ad^itt Marye Christ's mother to yt / because she
had a husband. Oh / ignorant Assee / and very beastlye Idiotes. I think you
follow Judas which had neither wife nor child / unless he had the^ sitting
by other men's fyers / as many of you have yet at this same day. What is
virginite before God more than is marriage? No more than is circumcysyon in
comparyson to vncircu^cysyon. And that is nothing. No more makes the one than
the other / to a Christian life. Only is yt faith effectuallye workynge by
love / that the lord requires of us.

Only respected he the faith of Marye / and not her virginite. They which
live in matrimonye after the word of God / are accepted before him for virgyns
/ and so are named of Saint Paul. An other ca^illacion they have / that non
which has offended before / can be of this nombre. But they consider not what
is spoken here before / that they were redeemed from the earth / and that the
sprete of the lord has puryfyed their hearts through faith. Neither have
they grace to remember that Christ's innoce^cye is rekened for an whole and
perfight rightousnesse unto them that believe in him / but they must bring in
soche tryfles / as are their own beggerlye merytes.

19 And therefore it follows also. These faithful beleuers (says Saint Johan)
were redeemed from men / being the first fruits to God and to the lamb. By
non other were they redeemed / than by Christ* For of all the elect nombre / he
is the only rightousnesse / wisdom / holiness / and redempcio^. From the
corrupt / blind / and froward multitude has he called them / taken them /
and clered them. And of deformed sinners / has he made them fair / of vile
pure / of wreched gloryouse / of blind perfyghtlye seeing / of liars true
sayers / of obstinate gentle / of ill good / and of unfruitful profitable.
For he yt is that takes away the stonye heart / and gives a soft heart for
yt / so making us Abraham's children. Thus are we redeemed from men / wh^ we
are taken by his goodness from soche corrupt vsages as man's nature is
inclined unto.

20 And for non other purpose / but to be the first fruits unto god / as were
the altar offeringes in the old law / in the hands of the high prestes. For
so much as the elect Nombre are but a few or a serten taken out from the
universal multitude / and are the porcyon of the lord (as were the said
offerynges) perteyninge unto Christ the only bishop of our sowles / they are
his first fruits. Yea / and his own very mystical members / and all but one
offering unto God the father by him. For he is the only lamb that dyed for
them / his own body being the only oblacyon and sacrifice.

21 And in their mouths was found no gyle. For non other words uttered they
but his pure testymonyes. Non other taught they but his undefiled laws. Non
other persuaded they to be observed of other / but his immaculate Gospel or
easy burden of Christ. No importable yokes laid they upon men's / shulders /
neither of Ceremonies / fastinges / nor mass hea^ynges.

22 For they are without spotte before the trone of God. Both before them that
are faithful and have right judgment in the sp^e^e (which are the very
seats of God) apereth their doctrine pure / and also their life innocent /
before God him self. Neither are they spotted with filthy tradicions / nor yet
with vncomlye examples. And as concerning their former sins / they shall not
be imputed unto them. They are remitted in Christ / and so forgotten before God.
Though this that here has been spoken be concerning the whole Christen
multitude and her preachers / yet does it most specially touch the Jews or
Israelytes that shall in this latter age be converted unto Christ. And so do I
counsel the reader to understand it. For the mount Syon after the flesh was
theirs. Not defiled are they with unmarried women / which are the whoryshe
laws and unclean Supersticions of the Gentyles / upon non other harp have
they commonly harped but upon the scripturs / though it has not been to the
pleasure of God / till now in this latter age / wherein they shall whollye turn
unto Christ.

The Paraphrase.
1 An other Angel saw I (says Saint Johan) fly in the mids of heaven. For
Christ was the first Angel or massenger of the everlasting covenant of the
father. This Angel here mencyoned is non other than he that had the seal of
the living God in the vii. Chapter / and he that was clothed with a cloud in
the tenth chapter. And he betokens those fervent mynysters wh^m God hach sent
in this latter time / to admonish his people to fle from the errors of
Antichrist and return to his heavenly veritees.

2 He flies in the mids of heaven. An ernest / fervent / and faithful
course take they in the mids of Gods congregation (which is his heavenly
kyngedome here / to who^ this reuelacion is written / like as ded Paulus /
Sylas / and Barnabas / Timotheus / Titus / and Cleme^s / with other of the
Apostles / syncerelye to declare his word. Mighty stomaked are they in Gods
cause / both in their words and wrytinges.

3 An everlasting gospel had this angel to preach unto them that sytte and
dwell upon the earth / and to all nations / kynredes / and people. His eternal
testament and covenant of peace has the lord given unto them / to preach
delyueraunce to the captive / health to the wounded / life to the dead / and
remission to the sinful. Yea / to utter that word that is stronger than is
heaven or earth / and that shall never fail him that truly believes.

4 The sound of this gospel must go the world over / as in the Apostles
time. Every where must it be spredde to the increase of faith. Among all
nations of the earth / among all kynredes of the Israelytes / among all
la^guages of the world / and among all kinds of people / of what sort so ever
they be / whether they sytte upon the earth or dwell upon the earth / whether
they be high or low / governors or subjects / masters or servants / owners
or fermers. So that they sytt not nor dwell not within the earth / or have
their felicyte here. For that is holy should not be given unto dogs / nor yet
pearls laid before swyne.

5 And he cried with a loud voice. With a mighty fervent sprete do they beat
it into the heads of men / both by words / writings / and all they can
make / to have the fear of God / and to give him his dew honor. And this is
the doctrine they teach / and the counsel they give.

6 Fear ye God in all that ye do for the first point of godly wisdom is to
dread least we offend him. Be constaunt in the word / and fear no
displeasure of men. For no more can they do in their anger but slay the body
/ and bring it to the rest of God. No power have they over the soul. Fear
him only therefore / that when he has destroyed both / may throw them into
hell.

7 Give honor unto him / worship him / and serve him alone. Praise him / and
glorifye him above all. But yet after non other sort tha^ he has appointed /
which is in faith / sprete / and veryte / and not in outward shadows with
obseruacyon of times. He truly honors him that trusts in him / that
believes his word / and that in spyght of all Antychristes confesses it before
all men. After this sort therefore fear him / and worship him / nothing
doubting the assaults of enemies.

8 For the hour of his judgment is come. At hand is it that all the
Antychristes and hipocrites shall by the invincyble word of God be judged /
condemned / and destroyed. From heaven shall his wrath be declared upon all
their ungodliness. With the sprete of his mouth shall the lord consume the^
/ and not long after will the great day of his indignacion toward them
light suddenly upon them.

9 With all faithful obsequy worship him therefore that create heaven and earth
in wonderful strength and bewtye.

10 That made the sea and the fountaynes of water with all that in them does
move / whose power is eternal / knowledge non other God but him. Non other
helper / redemer / nor sauer but his Crist. For all other Christ's not sent of
him are but Antychrystes. Only bow your knees unto him / for only is his
strength everlasting. Only obey his laws / for only a^e his laws clean.

and vehement / as was Helias / Esaye and Paul. And all this works the self
same one sprete. This diuersyte of teachers was neuermore plentuouse in the
world than now in owr time figured here by these two angels. Praised by the
lord therefore.

2 And the tenoure or ground of this latter sort of preachers is this. She is
fallen / she is fallen / even miserable Babylon th^^ great cite of whordome /
because she made all nacyons to drink of the wrathefull wine of her
fornycacion. So sure is it that the execrable church of Antichrist shall be
overthrown / and utterly destroyed / as it were now performed in deed.
Nothing shall be vnroted out that the heavenly father has not planted. Sonner
shall heaven and earth peryshe / than this promise be vnfulfylled.

3 For with the stinkinge whoryshnesse of her supersticiouse worshippynges /
have she poysened all nations and peples / under heaven. The great governors /
and learned lawers of the world / has she made in manner of beastlye dronkerdes
/ wytlesse / faythlesse / and graceless / by their prostibulouse doctrine. And
this shall be declared more at large in the.xvij. chapter following / where as
she is more plentuouslye described.

The Text.
1 And the third angel followed them. 2. saying with a loud voice. 3. If any
worshypp the beast and his Image. 4. and receive his mark in his fore head /
or on his hand. 5. the same shall drink of the wyue of the wrath of God. 6.
which is poured in the cup of his wrath. 7. and he shall be punnyshed in
fire and brymstone. 8. before the holy angels. 9. and before the lamb.

The Paraphrase.
1 The third Angel also (says Saint Johan) followed them in the third kind
of preaching of the same self massage / that in the mouth of.ij. or.iij.
faithful witnesses all veryte might stand.

2 And by this angel are they signified / that by the word of God stifflye
impugn their wicked laws and ungodly ordynaunces / whose manner of ernest
preachinge is this.

3 If any man worship the Beast / which is the great Antichrist. And his Image
/ which are those governors that takes upon them his blasphemouse titles /
names / auctoryte / or defense. If any manne also receive his mark in his
fore head / beleuynge their laws to be a christen doctrine / or have the
pryn^e of his seal upon his right hand / which is to fashion his outward
works after the same. The same manne shall drink of the wine of Gods wrath /
which are the dregs of the pure wine powered in the cup of his high
dyspleasure. He shall taste of the everlasting dampnacyon / that is reserved in
the latter curse or fearful sentence of their most terryble judge. To worship
the Beast and his Image / is to accept them in conscience / and in the outward
obedience with full consent of the heart. For that they blasphemously^ pretend
/ without gods auctoryte. As the Pope for Gods vycar or forgeuer of sins /
Mahomete for the great Prophet of the lord / the ^ewlers of the earth for
the popes elder or younger sons / for most christen kings / and defenders of
the faith of that holy church.

4 To receive the Beasts mark in their fore heads and hands / is both to
agree to soche decrees / tradycyons / laws / constitucyons / acts / and
proclamacyons / as they under those tytles have made / only for their own
covetousness and pomp / and neither for the glory of God nor yet for the
right mayntenaunce of the christen common welthe / as I have declared before.
And also to be sworn to the same / to subscrybe to it / to give counsel or
aid to it / to maynteyne it by learning / to mynister in it / to execute under
it / to accuse / po^nyshe / and put to death for yt / or to think yt lawful
and godly with soche like.

5 These marked worshippers shall taste of the cup of Gods indygnacyon / of
calamyte sorrow and wrechednesse in the days of their fall here / and after
the last judgment of unspeakable peynes and most greuouse torments / in
everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

6 The dregs that the lord has poured out (says David) shall the wicked of
the earth drink. Clean contrary are these Angels to the horned mynysters of
Antychryst. For they maynteyne the Popes errors / these the only verytees of
Christ. They labor for the glory of their Pope / these seeks the only
honor of God. They pra^e that their holy church shall co^tinewe / these
say it shall down with shame. They require worship to the Beast and his Image
/ these will report it blasphemouse / and the reward thereof dampnacyon. Mark
in these.ij. sorts the preachers of owr time / and judge which are of God.
Against both beasts in Christ's quarrel shall these Angels contend. Against
the Pope and his bishops / Mahomete and his doctors / will these godly
mynisters replye (who^ the lord has sent in this latter age for that purpose)
conde^pnynge by the scripturs their auctoryte / iurisdiccion / and power /
declarynge also the plages that will fall upon them for wytholdynge the truth
of God in vnryghtousnesse.

7 For these Antichrists and their worshippers with so many as bears their
token shall be ponnished in fire and brymstone / before the holy Angels / and
before the lamb. Fire shall be kyndled (says Moses) in the anger of the
lord / and shall burn unto the bottom of hell. Upon the ungodly (says
David) shall he rain snares. Fire / brymstone / storm / and tempest shall be
there porcyon to drink. The vehement indignacion and mighty judgment of God /
shall light upon them / as upon Sodom and Egypt / and shall both devour them
and consume them.

8 And this shall be in the sight of Angels. Which are not only the spretes of
heaven / but also the church of the faithful. Yea / the ryghtouse shall
rejoice when he ^^yth the destruction / and shall wash his hands in the
blood of the wicked.

9 In the presens of the lamb shall it be also. For he is evermore with his
flock / and shall be unto the end of the world / wherein he shall sytte and
con^dempne them.

The Text.
1 And the smoke of their torment ascends up evermore. 2. And they have no
rest day nor night. 3. which worship the Beast and his Image. 4. and who so
ever receives the prynt of his name. 5. Here is the pacycyence of Saints. 6.
Here are they that keep the commandments. 7. and the faith of Jesus.

The Paraphrase.
1 And the smoke of their torment ascends up evermore / as the flame of a
furnace with most horrible stynke / for a perpetual sign of their ponnyshment
/ like as it ded from Sodom and Gomor / wha^ the lord ouerthrewe the^.

2 So that they have no rest neither day nor night / so many as worship the
Beast and his Image / receyuynge the print of his name.

3 Both in this life are they crucyat^ with a troblouse and doubtful
conscience / and also after this life with unspeakable peynes. For neither
shall their worm dye / nor yet their fire be quenched / all flesh abhorrynge
them.

4 Thus shall they be with the Beast tormented / which have the sprete of the
beast. For like as all the faithful (which has been from the beginning)
belongs to one mistycal body in Christ / and shall be preserved by him / so
does the wicked perteyne to one mystycall Antichryst / having all one sprete
with him / and so shall with him perish.

5 Here is the patience of the Saints. In this life are their trobles. No
pleasure is for the^ in this world / but hate / rebukes / slanders / lies /
persecucio^s / and death of their bodies. Their life upon earth is continual
affliccio^ / but gloryouse is the fruit of their labors. Manyfolde are the
mysfortunes of the rightouse / but the lord clears them of all.

6 Here are they vexed that keep the commandments and the faith of Jesus.
Here are they had in derisio^ / that behave the^ selves as the ministers of God
in much patience / affliccions / need / anguyshe / labor / strypes /
impriso^me^t / and soche like.

7 Here are they chastened of the lord with many sore storms / that they
should not be dampened with this world. Much have they here to suffer of
enemies / that only cleaves to the word of God in life and doctrine.

The Text.
1 And I herd a voice from heaven saye^ge unto me. 2. write. 3. Blessed are
the dead / which hereafter dye in the lord. 4. (eue^ so says the sprete) that
they may rest from their labors. 5. but their works shall follow them.

The Paraphrase.
1 And I hard a voice from heaven (says Saint Johan) saying unto me.

2 Write with thy pen / or mark surely this sentence folowinge for the^
that here suffers in the truths quarrel.

3 Blessed are the dead / or they which are alredye departed / and that also
shall here after depart in the lord. This voice from heaven are the infallyble
scripturs / assertanynge the faith of Johan / of the sweet rest of the Saints
in the hands of God. And that their end is not without honor / as the vain
sort supposes / but they are counted among the dear children of God. Let them
therefore that suffer in this age be ernestlye spreted / and not fear the
torments of the enemies in Christ's cause.

4 For from hence forth (the sprete says) that they rest from their labors.
In a wonderful quietness dwell they / by the very sentence of the holy
ghost / and shall never more feel of any woo. God has clean wyped away all
tears from their eyes / all sor^wes and peynes from their bodies / the first
dangers being past. Happy are they therefore and most godly fortunate / that
are slain for Christ / because they will not worship the Beast and his Image /
nor corrupt their faith with their wicked laws / but in a pure Christen
believe departs from hence to the lord. Their porcyon is in the land of the
living / and their lotte among the holy ones.

5 For certen^ye their works does follow them. The promise^ ^^warde of God for
constantlye standing by the veryte / for the fruits of their christen patience
/ and for other exercyses of their faith / is evermore to their glory present
with them. Not as deserved of the^ / but of Christ / in whose faith they
wrought here / and for the promise sake / that they should be Gods heirs
together with Christ. The lyuelye word also / which they ernestlye received
here and so roted in their faith / will never suffer them to peryshe / nor to
be hurt of the ^conde death.

1 And I looked / and behold. 2. a white cloud. 3. and upon the cloud one
sittynge like unto the son of man. 4. having on his head a golden crown.
5. and in his hand a sharp syckle.

The paraphrase.
1 I looked yet further (says Saint Johan) and euydentlye before me apered a
whyght cloud / which betokens the true mynisters of Gods word. Whom the
holy ghost calls clouds by Esaye / David / Peter / and Judas. For from the^
falls upon the people the sweet drops of his verytees.

2 Whyght they are as milk for their faith in the word. And for their
Christen conuersacyon not blotted with Hypocresye of men's corrupted customs.

3 Upon this cloud was one sitting like unto the son of man / which is
verelye Christ / in his gloryfyed manhood. For evermore is he among his true
preachers / geuynge them soche vtteraunce and wisdom / as all their enemies
are not able to withstand. Always walks he among the.vij. candelstyckes /
which are his congregacyons as we had before

4 He had upon his head a golden crown / in token of his eternal and
vncorrupt kyngedome / and in his hand a sharp syckle / which is the sharp
judgment or ryghtuousnesse of his word / for there with shall he reap his
latter harnest. According to his word and promise shall he judge good and
evil.

5 This syckle received he of his everlasting father / soche time as he gave
over unto him his universal judgments. By the order of this vysyon should the
preachers seem in the last age of the church / much to admonyshe the people of
the latter day / with the coming of Christ again to judge both the quick
and the dead as is in their creed / or believe.

1 And an other Angel came out of the temple. 2 crya^ge with a loud voice to

time is come to reap. 5. For the corn of the earth is ripe. 6. And he that
satte on the cloud. 7. thrust in his syckle on the earth 8 and the earth was
reaped.

The Paraphrase.
1 And an other Angel (says saint Johan) came out of the temple / which is
the congregacyon of faith / consecrated as an holy temple unto God in the
blood of the undefiled lamb Jesus. This Angel betokens those just me^ne /
that with Symeon and anna the daughter of Phanuell / in this latter age are
desy^rouse of the glory of God / and of the fynall redempcyon of man from
bodily corrupcyon.

2 These shall cry with a loud voice / with a fervent sprete shall they call
unto Christ / which sits upon the cloud.

3 And this shall be their sainge. Thrust in the syckle and reap. Send forth
thy (...) word. And like as yt has created all things / so let yt now try
and judge all things.

4 For the time is at hand to reap. For we are those upon whom the ends of
the world are come.

5 And doubtless the corn of the earth y^ ripe / the world is at the best
that yt will do. As it has been ever / so is yt still / all together sort upon
myscheff. Let thy word therefore fynyshe all / as yt has began all. With the
breathe of thy mouth / (...) the great Antichrist / (...) of sin / the son
of perdycyon / and the aduersarye that has exalted himself above God. Pour
out thy indygnacion upon the kyngedomes that will neither know the / worship
the / nor alone call upon thy name. Thu have called thy harvest the end of the
world / let it now fynyshe all in deed. Diuyde the chafe from the corn /
the wicked sort from the ryghtouse. Gather the wheat into thy garner / and
burn the chafe in unquenchable fire.

6 And he that satte on the cloud thurst in his syckle on the earth / and
anon the earth was reaped.

7 He has sent his mighty word / so quycke in operacyon as fire. Which shall
not only consume the wicked generacyon of the Beast / but also reserve them to
eternal dampnacyon.

8 The earth shall be cleared of the^ as of all other filthy corrupcions /
and hell replenyshed with them / to their perpetual care.

1 And an other angel (says saint Johan) came out of the temple which is in

2 This Angel betokens those heaue^lye spretes that the lord shall se^de
forth to gather together his chosen from the iiij. wyndes / when his token
shall apere in heaven These are the reapers of the lords harvest. These are
they that shall go forth to gather all nacyons / and to separate the gottes
from the la^bes / the ill from the good / and shall cast them into a furnace of
fire / where as shallbe waylinge and gnashinge of tethe.

3 And therefore is their syckle here named sharp. Non other is their syckle /

The Paraphrase.
1 And an other Angel came out from the altar which had power over fire. This
is the lord Jesus Christ / whom Malachias calls the Angel of the covenant
that was longed for. He is the altar of the ryghtouse / and by him are they a
sweet sacrifice unto God. Else could they be but very abhominacyon. Till the
judgment day shall he be an altar of means making to God the father for
us. But that day ones come / no longer shall he be an altar or an advocate /
but go clean from yt. He shall than become a judge over all the world /
rewardynge every one according to their works. Hitherto has he mekelisytten
upon the cloud / and not cut with his syckle. He has had in his hand the
judgment / and not judged.

2 But now has he power over fire. By fire (which is under his obedyence / as
are all other creaturs else) shall he at that day judge the universal world.
And more sharp / vehement / quycke ferce / mighty / and terryble shall his
sentence be to the wicked / tha^ is any fearful / flaminge / or co^sumynge
wild fire.

3 For with a loud voice shall he cry unto him that has the sharp syckle.
An ernest charge and commandment shall he give at that day to the ministers
of his ire / for to cast them into exteryoure darkness / after this sort here
vttred in mysterye.

4 Thrust in thy sharp syckle / and gather the clusters of the earthlye
vyneyarde / for the grapes thereof are r^pe.

5 Execute the vengeance committed unto you / and rote out this rank ry^^ouse
generacyon of the rauenouse Epicures.

6 For now are their myscheues at the full. Now are they most curyous in their
facyons and fedynges / most couetouse in their compassynges / most vain in
their stodyes and most cruel in their doings. For with them shall yt be
(says Christ) as yt was in the days of Noe and Loath. They shall build and
banquet / ruffle and riot / bye and sell / and plant for their pleasurs.

And suddenly as a snare shall that terrible day light upon them vnbewares /
as ded death on the couetouse iourer.

7 And the Angel (says Johan) thrust in his syckle on the earth / he cut
down the grapes of the vineyard of the earth / and so ded cast them into the
great wine fatt of the wrath of God.

8 According to their commission they shall plage the earthlye minded / for
here is the time past for the time coming used / for the certente of yt. With
soden death shall they perce the^ in this world / that contempnynge Christ's
doctrine has followed the course thereof in all concupiscence.

9 And fynallye they shall throw them into the lake of myserye / the pyt
without water unto the stynkynge ^regges of hel^e / where as fire and brymstone
shall be rewarded to drink. For the vyneyarde of the earth is the carnal
Synagoge of Hypocrites ^ and the grapes thereof are the gloryouse glottons / and
frank f^dde porkelynges of that gredye gulf / even the enemies of Christ's
cross / whose God is their bellye / whose glory is their confusion / and
whose end is their dampnacyon / for they are earthlye minded. This wine fat
of the wrath of God is non other than his great bengeaunce / to be poured
upon the unfaithful. Or else hell / prepared for the devil and his angels.
Great / not only for the innumerable multitude that yt has and shall receive
/ but also in that yt is insacyable.

10 And this wyntfatt was trodde^ without the cite. Nothing perteyneth yt to
that cite (of whom famous things are spoken) which is the congregacyon of God
/ nor yet to the good creaturs of God. No / not unto this world / which shall
at that day be tried and pourged by fire. But under the earth shall yt be /
and far without this world / secluded from the face of heaven in filthy and
unspeakable darkness.

11 For blood will come out of this fat / eue^ unto the horse brydles. Wherein
is expressed not only the terror of the place / but also of the peynes there
in contained. For blood shedynge and murder are things very horrible and
fearful to behold / contayninge in the^ depriuacyon of life / which is most
terrible of all. The habundaunce thereof betokens the greatness of the grefe
in the sufferaunce of them. The treadinge down also sygnyfieth / that no raise
toward any relefe is to be looked for of them that be there. Unto them which
at that day shall be in the cite / will he that sytteth in the trone make al
things new. All dolor / affliccyon / so row / pain / penurye / / wrath /
conde^pnacyon / and death / shall be past with them. Only shall they be
trodden down in this wynefatt of Gods wrath / that lived here like beasts
without reason / and that wandered here like horses and mules in their own
filthye lusts.

12 All shall be ponnyshed there / that was here unbridled / vnordred / and
ungoverned after the word and pleasure of God. And therefore yt is here said /
unto the horse brydles. Every manne shall receive in body according to that
he has done / whether yt be Good or evil. They that have wrought the storke
of God in faith / shall reap according unto yt. The brydles also betokens
the measure of gods judgment / not as concerning the time which ^s
everlasting / but concerning the pain ryghtlye measured according to the in
aquite. For the lord has set his judgments over the wicked in wayght and
measure / the stripes agreynge in quantyte to the excess of sin / so much
torment to have / as their rejoice has been in wickedness.

13 The space of these terrible torments or ponnyshme^tes of hell / is a
thousand and.vi. hundred furlonges. A furlonge of the Greeks is called the
^onne of hercules / and yt is in lenghte an hundred and.xxv. passes or steps.
And commonly they used according to that lenghte / to measure their playenge
places. Of whom Paul makes mencyon to the Corinthyanes being Greeks / by
them that ro^neth in a course / and that proves mastryes. In this thousand
and.vi. ho^dred furlonges here / is comprehended the whole and universal
course of the wicked for the.iiii. quarters of the world. The nombre of an
hundred is evermore an whole complete and perfyght nombre. And.iiii.
hundred.iiii. times no^bred is.xvi. hundred / which makes this nombre of a
thousand and.vi. hundred / the nombre of.iiii. respectinge always the.iiii.
climates of the world / which are the common habitacions of sinners. In them
course they in all wanton kinds of lyuinge. In them work they their mastryes
of all ungodly obseruacyons and false worshyppinges / walkinge in the large or
open way which leads unto death. According to the nonbre and measure of
this course / has God here measured the place and ponnyshment. Not
withstandinge never is he without mercy. Maruelouse he is in his works and
judgments / which are unsearchable. Blessed is he that shall have his part in
the cite or congregacyon of the ryghtouse / and that shall se the peace upon
Israel / when the lord shall lead forth them with the evil doers / that
has yoked themselves with their laws. The lord grant us ones to taste the
prosperyte of Jerusalem. Amen.

The.xv. Chapter.
NOt only for the common sins of the world does the lord plage / but most
of all for unthankfulness of all bla^^phemyes the greatest For tha^ spurneth
against knowledge / and dyrectlye works against the holy Ghost. A double
destruccyon or decay both of soul and body by the ryghtousnesse of God must
needs follow the wylful contempt of his veryte manifestlye showed and openly
taught. Yet is the lord so merciful / that he wills not the dampnacion of a
sinner. Soche compassion has he over our manyfolde weakness / that he
premonysheth us of his most terrible plages / to call us back by fear / if
love will not do yt. As here consequentlye in the first vysyon of this present
reuelacyon to Johan / which follows after this sort in this xv. and.xvi.
chapters.

The Text.
1 And I same another sign in heaven / great and maruelouse. 2. seven Angels
having the seven last plages. 3. for in them is fulfilled the wrath of God.
4. And I saw as yt were a glassye see. 5. myngled with fire. 6. and them that
had gotten victory of the Beast / and of his Image. 7. and of his mark / and
of the nombre of his name. 8. stand on the glassye see. 9. having the harpes
of God. 10. And they sange the song of Moses the servant of God. 11. and the
song of the lamb / saying. 12. Great and maruelouse ar thy works / lord God
almyghtye. 13. just and true are thy / ways / thu king of saints. 14. Who
shall not fear (o lord) and glorifye thy name? 15. For thu only art holy.
16. and all Gentyles shall come and worship before the. 17. for thy judgments
are made manifest.

The Paraphrase.
1 And I saw (says saint Johan) by the secret goodness of my lord God /
yet an other token in heaven / great and maruelouse / strange and wonderful.
For in the church or congregacyon of God are evermore vttred his wonderful
and deep judgments / unto them only whom his grace appoynteth / as unto
Johan. And this is the token in mysterye.

2 Seven angels had in their hands the seven last plages. Some exposytours
have taken these Angels for the right mynisters in the.vij. ages of the
christen church. Some have thought them to be the perverse preachers and
ungodly mynisters of all the said ages / suffered of God strongelye to delude
the unbelievers / that he which hurts should hurt still / and that he which is
in fylthynesse should still be filthy. Unto every age correspondynge an Angel
/ to declare the nature of those deceytfull hyrelynges and lyenge masters. And
this makes them so to understand the text. They are here expreslye noted to
be in heaven. Among the congregacyons of God are the false prophets and
dissembling hypocrites evermore / as the chafe among the corn / the tares
among the wheat / and the filthy dregs among the pure wine. For that
kyngedome is as a net thrown into the sea and gatherynge all manner of fyshes
both good and badde. In all ages has the wicked generacyon increased / to
impugn the truth / and styflye to stand up against God and his Christ /
which is non other after their minds / than to mynistre the.vij. last plages
here. For no poison is to the soul so pestylent / nor yet venime so noyfull /
as is false doctr^ne. No plage can be thought more deadlye nor vyrulent / than
to depryue us of that faith / of that veryte / and of that life which is in
Christ Jesus / or to bring us out of that way which he has appointed. And all
this seems no small lykelyhode of the just understanding of the text here.
Yet gives Frances Lan^bert a far better judgment / calling them the set
sentences or vnvariable decrees of God / diffinynge his judgments against the
wicked in this latter age of the world / at their appointed times to be
uttered. For all these things are ioyntlye to be considered. These Angels came
not only from heaven / which is the congregacyon (as they have mencyoned) but
also out of the celestyall temple of the tabernacle of testimonye / which is
the omnipote^t God and his Christ / as the.xxi. chapter here of declares. They
are also clothed with pure whyght lynnen / gyrded with golden gyrdels / they
have golden vyals delivered unto them by one of the.iiij. Beasts / and one of
them commoneth with Johan / declarynge unto him the judgment and fall of the
great whore. Which are no arguments that they are here to be taken for ill
preachers / thowgh they here mynistre the last.vij. plages. Therefore shall we
judge them here to be Gods appointed purposes or eternallye decreed pleasurs /
against the wylfull obstynates and indurate rebellyous to the end of the
world. These are called the last plages / because they fall in the last age of
the world / whom Esaye / Hieremye / Oseas and Mycheas calls the last days /
Johan the last hour / and Paul the ends of the world. Seven are they named
here in a universal respect both of the times / parsones / places / and
perverse doctrynes of the whole world. And also because of the.vij. seals and
the.vij. trompettes / to whose judgments they Ioyntlye agree / as in the next
chapter folowinge will apere more largelye.

3 For in them (says the text) is fulfilled the wrath of God. The indignacyon
of the lord is in them whollye declared. For what hate can he show more unto
manne / than to withdraw from him his grace / to leave him to him self / to
suffer him in his own blind judgments / to give him over to his own
filthy lusts / and to send him the operacyon of error to his double
dampnacyon? A very fulfyllynge of Gods anger is it also to appoint us a false
Prophet or deceyuable curate / a wanton Prince or ungodly gouernoure. These
therefore with soche like are those plages / in whom is depelye accomplyshed the
dyspleasure of God. And they are here named the last plages / for after them
shall non other be seane / the latter day fynyshynge and clearynge all.

4 And I beheld (says Saint Johan) in the same said vysyon / as it were a
glassye see / or a great flowynge water in symylytude of glass / all myngled
with fire. Non other is this see but the precyouse veryte of the Lord / so
clear as glass and so pure as crystal. This see gushed out of the hard
rock stone / that was cloven a sonder in the desert. When he sent forth his
sprete / these waters flowe^ forth in habundaunce.

5 Most effectual and quycke is this see. And therefore it is here noted as
myngled with fire / which signifies the holy ghost. For never is the veryte
without Gods sprete. A ferce fyerye streme calls Danyel this see. All fyerye
is thy word lord (says David also) and therefore thy servant loves it. This
is the fou^tayne of living water spryngynge up into the life everlasting.
Unto this water should all they resort that are thurstye / thereof to take
refreshynge.

6 Upon this glassye see were they seen of Saint Johan / that had obtained
victory of the Beast / of his Image / of his mark / and of the nombre of his
name. By whom are meant those constaunt christianes / which has for all ages
firmelye affermed the truth. For non aduersyte declinynge from it. Strongelye
have these sens the Apostles time resysted the adversaries of God by his only
word / perfystynge therein unto the death as ded Steven / James / and Antipas
with soche other his faithful witnesses. Uictorye have they gotten by faith
both of the Beast and his Image / both of the great Antychryst and his
supporters / of the Pope and of Mahomete / with their maynteyners Emprours /
kings / and magistrates / and of all them that usurp their title / name /
seat / auctoryte / pomp or power.

7 They have blemyshed likewise by the said word not only the mark of the
Beast / which is a corrupted faith / but also the nombre of his name / which
is the denial of God. Them have they to their rebuke uttered / and to their
confusion declared. They have proved their orders dampnable / their doctrine
deuyllyshe / their religion hypocrisye / and their spiritualte plain
wickedness / condempnynge them by the scripturs / as ungodly dyssemblers
denyenge the lord which bought them. These are they whom the lord tenderlye
norryshed / and gracyouslye brought forth upon the refreshynge waters /
converting their sowles to his godly fear and love.

8 These stand evermore on the glassye see / they set sure fotynge upon the
rock stone. Unmoueablye they persevere in the truth / never denyenge yt before
men.

9 And they have in their hands the harpes of God / which are devour minds
given all unto godliness / and reioysynge in spiritual things.

10 Harmonyouslye they sing the tuneable song of Moses the faithful
servant of God / and the melodyouse sweet song of the lamb Jesus Christ.

11 Of both testamentes they make vtteraunce / declarynge the wonderful works
and terrible judgments out of the old law / and out of the gospel of
gladness the most sweet mercy of the lord. Without ceasynge open they the
scripturs unto other inwardlye reioysinge in spiritual hymns and psalms /
having this evermore for the standing tenoure of their song.

12 Inestimablye great is thy goodness / and wonderfullye maruelouse are thy
works O Lord God almyghtye.

13 Just are thy promyses / and most perfightlye sure thy ways / thu gloriouse
king of Saints / and graciouse gyde of the godly beleuers.

14 Who shall not evermore fear the / o mighty lord? who shall not always
in heart gloryfye / thy blessed name?

15 Thu alone art holy / just / and perfight / for non is there good but thy
self only. Thu art owre only maker / redemer / and co^fortoure. Non other
have we for owre God but the.

16 No doubt of it but the time will be that all kinds of people / both Jews
and Gentyles / faithful and heythen shall seek unto the / and shall
faythfullye in veryte and sprete worship before the / acknowlegynge the for
their only lord God.

17 Because thy wonderful judgments that sumtyme were secret / are now to
the world made openly known and manifest. Though this song be little and
small / yet is therein contained all veryte / that both Moses and Christ
confesses at large. Moreover what so ever the scripturs comprehends / either
of the great omnipote^cye of God or of his most wonderful works / either of
his louinge mercy or of his benign pytie toward manne / of his gloriouse
name or mighty power / or that he is to be magnifyed and feared / or how that
the faithful perteyneth only to his kingedome / or how that all people shall
finallye be converted unto him. All is compendiouslye in this brefe song here
contained / what though it be not so word by word expressed. And as
concerning that is here last spoken / that his judgments are made manifest /
it is to be understood of those faithful creaturs whom he calls / clereth
and iustyfyeth / and of non other. For unto them only are his heavenly
verit^es known / to whom he wytsaueth to open them. Though the other
outwardlye se the judgments of God / yet do they not inwardlye perceive the^ /
though they boast it never so much. For it is not given them so to do. They
must have eyes and not se / ears and not understand.

The Paraphrase.
1 And a non after that (says Sayn^ Johan) I looked yet more aduysedly. And
suddenly as it were / the everlasting temple of the tabernacle of witness was
open in heaven.

2 A mysterye this is very ernestlye to be marked / as a thing of great
wayght. The lord almyghtye is this eternal temple. He is the temple not made
with hands / uncreated / gloriouse and full of mageste / comprehendynge in him
all things / and he within non again comprehended. He is the lord of all. He
measures heaven with his spanne / he over reaches all the world with
his.iij. fingers. In him we live / we move / and have owr being. The
tabernacle of witness is the lamb Jesus Christ. He is that very tabernacle
of God that was here among men / bearinge that faithful witness which
gives wisdom to babes. He is the propiciatorye or mercy seat / wherein we
are hard and forgeuen. Neither was this tabernacle of this manner building /
but much more perfyght and greatter. This holy tabernacle is within the
aforesaid temple / for Christ dwells in the father and the father in him.

3 Open is this temple in heaven / and the tabernacle seane / when God is
known by true preaching / and Christ's doctrine believed. For he came into the
world / and for that purpose was borne / to bear witness unto the truth /
whom the father wylled only to be hard / concerning faith.

4 This temple and tabernacle open / or God and his word ones known in this
latter age / the seven Angels comes forth. The eternal decrees of Gods
secret judgments apereth / and are fulfilled in their times. As Angels or
massengers of God they have in his eternyte their just plages in their season
appointed to be exhybited.

5 And therefore are they said to come out from the temple which is God. Nothing
has he purposed to the world / but he has decreed yt before the worlds
constitucyon. For his purpose / mind / and pleasure / is as he is /
everlasting. And as it falls to the world by his assignement / it becomes
a massenger / going out of the temple. So many has he sent of soche
massengers / as he has fulfilled decreed purposes. And maruele not though they
be here called Angels / considering that it is the common manner of the holy
scrypturs evermore to call them Angels which utters the will / pleasure / and
commandment of God / as they do here. After this sort are the prestes called
Angels / so is Aggeus the holy Prophet / so is Saint Johan Baptyst / so are
Christ's dyscyples / and also the publyque preachers.

6 What the plages are that they shall shed out of their vyals / will be showed
clerelye in the next chapter following / one after an other.

7 These angels are aparelled in pure whyght lynnen / bright shynynge as
crystal / and gyrded about their breasts with gyrdels of fine gold / which
betokens their sincere clennesse / and their gloryouse perfyghtnesse. For
what can be more pure and precyouse / than the eternal decrees of the lord?
What can be more perfyght and gloryouse than his prediffyned purposes? The
laws of God are undefiled / the testimonies are true / the statutes are right
/ the ways are sure / the commandments are clear / the judgments are
godly / the words are pure and precyouse. Yea / the gifts that come from the
father of light are evermore perfyght and good.

8 The gyrdynge of their breasts / is the straight spearynge up of the secret
meaning of Gods judgments from owr carnal understanding / till soche time
as he opens them unto us by his sprete. For yt belongs not unto us to
decerne soche secrets as the father reserueth to his own power.

9 And one of the.iiij. Beasts or congregacyons (says Saint Johan) delivered
unto the aforesaid.vij. Angels vij. golden vyals replenished with the wrathful
dyspleasure of God which lives for evermore. Though the congregacyons be in
the first chapter.vij. and in the forth.iiij. understood by the.iiij. Beasts
/ yet are they here in ^his place brought all unto one / and called one of
the.iiij. or else of the.iiij. made one / for so much as the universal
christen church is of one consent / one faith / one batyme / one God / and
perteyneth to one Christ. For so much also as it confesses / believes / and
teaches one doctrine of health. One is my d^ue (says the holy ghost) one is
my derely beloved darlynge. A Beast is it here noted / as lyuinge in the flesh
/ and not yet mortifyed by death.

10 The vyals of Gods wrath are the ungodly reprobates / fytt only for
destruccyon. Golden are they here named / because they apere gloryouse in the
worldly judgments of men. Very painted tombs are the dyssemblynge
hipocrites / within full of stynkinge bones. A shynynge name of life have they
and yet are they inwardlye dead. For all that they do is to be seane of men.

11 Full of wrath are they / wherbye is meant a synnefull understanding / with
dampnable doctrynes. For very swyft are they to all ungodliness. The.vi.
propertees have they which the lord hates / and the seventh which he utterly
abhors. A proud look / a dissembling tongue / bloudye hands / a wicked
heart / fere rydye unto myschef / ways to practyse lies / and sowynges of
dyssencyon among brethren. These are given of the true christen congregation
to the.vij. Angels / or decreed purposes of God to be judged as they have
eternallye diffyned. For non other is their continual prayer / but that his
will be fulfilled / and that his predyfined intentes against the perverse
multitude be fynyshed at their conuenyent times. Non other is it to putt into
the Angels hands the vyals of Gods displeasure / than thus to committ them by
faithful prayer to his purposed decrees or foreset ordinances.

12 But because that commonly when Gods judgments begin to wax known /
all things are commoued and trobled / therefore is it said here consequentlye
that the temple was full of smoke / by reason of the mageste of God and of his
gloryouse power. This smoke are serten mysteryes / representynge unto us the
hydden mageste of Gods eternal presence. Whose bryghtnesse can no frail
understanding abide. Nor / all the world cowde not sustain it if all things
were open and plain concerning it. In no wise could Moses presentlye se the
face of God / only might he be suffered to se his back parts. For no man
can se God and live. Only is he seane here in this life as in a glass or
under a dark speaking. He apereth unto us here in a mystycall smoke / like as
he ded to the Patriarch Jacob in sleep / to Moses in the flamynge bushe / to
Helias in the horle wind / to the Apostles in fyerye tongues / and unto Ananias
in a secret vysyon.

13 Under the shaddowe of fygurate locucyon is his glory of the elect
persons and faithful beleuers known. The unfaithful reprobates beholds
the smoke / but neither perceive they in it the glory of God / nor the mageste
of his presence. They neither conceive his wonderful works / nor yet his
godly judgments. Their folyshe hearts are so darkened / that though they
know God / yet glorifye they him not. They set the smoke and perceive the
world trobled (as it is always when the veryte apereth) but never the more
faith nor godly knowledge have they. But that which is unto the faithful a
raise / is unto the^ a ruin. That is unto the other the power of God unto
health / is unto them slander and folyshnesse. And that is unto the other a
sauoure of life unto life / is unto them a sauoure of death unto death. They
remember not that the lord came down in fire unto Moses upon mount Synay
when it smoked all together like a burning furnace / and therefore bear they
away no glorified faces / or consciences depured by a true perfyght faith.

14 And no man was able (says the text) to enter into the temple / till
the.vij. deadlye plages of the.vij. angels were whollye fulfilled. For though
the true beleuers perceive in the mysteries of the scripturs / the present
mageste and mygh tie power of God / yet enter they not in to full knowledge of
him / being as yet subject unto vanyte. For here is their knowledge vnperfyght
/ and their prophecyenge also. And therefore acknowlegynge their imbecillite /
and also waiting for the reuelacion of the children of God / they say with
Saint Paul. O the wonderful depenesse of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How
incomprehensible are his judgments / and how unsearchable his ways.

15 And at this point. shall they still be till the last judgment day fynishe
all. For the full entering into the temple is non other than a whole perfyght
or consummate knowledge of God and his misteryes. Which can not fullye be had /
till that which is vnperfyght be done away / the creature delivered from
bondage of corrupcyon. And till death be swallowed up / the vessel of
corrupcyon becommynge incorruptyble / and the mortal body becommynge
spyrituall. The ryghtouse shall than shine as does the sun in the kyngedome
of their father / and glyster as does the bright Stars world without end.
What the.vij. plages are / and what is their fulfyllynge / will in this chapter
following apere.

1 And I herd a great voice out of the temple. 2. saying to the seven Angels.
3. Go your ways. 4. pour out your vyalles of wrath upon the earth. 5. And
the first went / and poured out his vyall upon the earth. 6. and there fell a
noysom and a sore votche upon the men which had the mark of the Beast. 7. and
upon them that worsypped his Image.

The Paraphrase.
AN other great voice hard Ioha^ out of the temple. A perfyght / strong / and
ernest assurance had he of the lord by a spiritual premonyshment / that the
vnvariable decrees of his sert judgments should be fulfilled at their times of
him appointed. Yea / assertayned he was infallyblye that they should in their
dew seasons come to pass. For unto his fryndes opens he his secret
counsels always / as he ded in old time unto his well beloved Israel / unto
Moses / Zacharye / Ezechiel / and Daniel / with soche other.

2 And the voice was unto the.vii. Angels under the.vii. Seals opening and
the.vii. trompettes blowinge after this sort. Go your ways forth fulfillinge
the purpose ye be ordained unto. Pour ou^ your vyalles of wrath upon the
earth.

4 Declare them first of all to the world / to be the reprobate vessels of
dishonor / which of wylfulnesse conte^pneth my eternal veryte. Consequentlye
send the^ into most deep error / that they may wexe worse and worse / and
not only to err in themselves / but also to bring other into error / that
they may receive the double reward thereof / abiding my most fearful
judgment.

5 And in soche time as the lord appointed / the first Angel went fourth
under the first seal opening / and poured out his vyall upon the earth. For
in the first age of the church / to try her as gold in the furnace /
permytted the lord by his eternal decre / the malycyouse Synagoge of the
Jews to rage / and to do their ungodly feats. In the which their furyouse
madness / not only ded they persecute the Apostles and first preachers of
Christ from cite to cite / but also perverted the earthlye minded multitude by
many and diverse ungodly kinds of false doctrine in hipocresye. Of this
sort was Himineus and Pheletus / becomminge of Sadducees false Christyanes /
and denyenge the latter resurreccion / whom Paul ded excommunycate. So were
also Phigellus and Hermogenes / bringing in again circumcysyon with certain
ceremonyal obseruacyons to blemyshe the Gospel of Christ. These with soche
like subuer^ed whole howses (says Paul) teaching things that they ought not
to have ^aught for filthy lucres sake.

6 And when they were thus by the decreed purpose of God shed upon the earth /
or left unto their own earthlye beastlynesse / all destytute of his grace for
contempnynge his word so gracyouslye offered / there lyghted a noisome and
tedyouse botche upon those me^ne which had the mark of the Beast / or an
unchristian believe through their perswasyons.

7 And upon the^ also that worshypped his Image / or accepted them for Godly
that made laws repugnaunt to his laws. For the great headed Rabynes of the
Jews ded not only sport the consciences of the Israelytes their own natyue
contre men / but also of the Greeks and latynes / the Asianes and Romans /
compellynge them for their own tradycyons to make Gods commandementes of non
effect. These having a pretense of Godly living / denied the power thereof.
Of this sort were they which entered into howses / and brought into bondage
supers^y^youse women lo^en with sin. For a more deep understanding hereof /
confer this with the first Seal opening and the first Trompet blowynge /
and like wise the other.vi. following.

1 And the second Angel shed out his vyall. 2. upon the sea. 3. and it turned
as it were into the blood. 4. of a dead man. 5. And every living thing
dyed in the sea.

The Paraphrase
1 After this went fourth the second Angel of the second Seal opening
effundynge his vyall upon the sea. According to the decree of God almyghtye
for the second age of the Christen church / reigned among the Christyanes
deceytfull brethren and perverse teachers / betraynge the true mynysters and
delyuerynge them unto death for Jesus Christ's sake / that his life might be
se^ne in their mortal flesh. For in this life he proves his electes with
Abraham and Job to save them / and to make the^ just folowers of Christ / whom
yt behooved to suffer ere he e^tered into his glory

2 Upon the sea or wauerynge multitude was this vyall shed. Only are the
false Prophets received and taken of the folyshe / fantastycall / and slypper
wytted sort / as a read shaken of every wind. Non regards them which has
set sure fotynge upon the hard rock Christ. Soche a vyall or vessel of
Gods Ire was Mair the Idomyte which made the Talmud of the Jews / a book more
tha^.x. Gybles after Nauclerus and other Historianes / full of blasphemies and
lies condempnynge the doctrine of Christ. So was Rabby Moses the Egypcyane /
Rabyna and Rabasses with soche other confyrmynge the same.

3 All bloudye was this see / the vyall ones shed thereupon. All fleshlye were
the people in their judgments / their hearts fulfilled with cruelte and
mourther against Christ's true witnesses / through their perverse preachynges.
Yea / in that furiouse rage they thought they ded god great good service when
they putt his servants unto death.

4 This blood was also in a manner as the blood of a dead ma^ne. For dead was
the doctrine that they taught / even the sleyng letter yt self. Dead were also
their Ceremonies / their rytes / and their ydell obseruacyons.

So that every living thing dyed in that bloudye see. All they which semen
through glytteringe hypocresye to live / wanted the very life which is hid
in Christ / and that ryseth offaythe in his lyuinge word. So ded they also
which depended all upon the vain pleasurs of this life / exercysinge here
tyranny both in words and doings. Neither were they out of the same danger
/ that fell from the veryte ones known / nor yet they which durst not receive
yt for fear of persecution / but both peryshed in this see.

The Text.
1 And the third Angel shed out his vyall. 2. upon the ryuers and fountaynes
of waters 3. and they turned to blood. 4. And I herd an Angel say. 5. lord
which art and waste. 6. thu art ryghtouse and holy. 7. because thu have given
soche judgments. 8. For they shed the blood of saints and Prophets. 9. and
therefore have thu given them blood to drink / for they are worthy. 10. And I
herd an other Angel out of the altar. 11. say. 12. Even so / lord God
almyghtye. 13. true and ryghtouse are thy judgments.

The Paraphrase.
1 Next in his course went out the third Angel / under the third Seal
openinge / and he poured out his vyall upon the watterye flowdes and fowntaynes
/ and all they became very blood. By his set decree for the third age of
the church / suffered the lord false heretykes to rage in all kinds of
error / strongelye to delude the unbelievers.

2 These lyghted upon the sweet waters / by whom are meant the sacred scripturs
refreshinge the dry sowles. Who so ever drynketh (says Christ) of the waters
that I give / he shall never be more a thirst.

3 Of these waters have they defiled both the ryuers and welspringes with
blood. Both the law and Gospel / the figure and veryte / the commandment
and promise / the doctrine of Prophets and Apostles have they corrupted with
their false interpretacyons and gloses / with froward dryftesand opynyons /
with vain tradycyons and worshyppynges / and with carnal wisdom and
murtherynges. Of this sort were Eut^ces and Artius with soche other like / as
in the.viij. chapter before.

4 And I hard (says Saint Johan) an Angel / betokenynge those sincere
witnesses / to whom God had opened for that age his secret judgments. And
this Angel said.

5 Omnipotent creator and lord which art not only of thy self at this present
instaunt / but wart also essencyallye in thy self without beginning.

6 Thu heavenly lord art faithful in thy words and holy in thy works.

7 For as yt apereth before our eyes / the decrees and fore judgments that
thu made before / are now fulfilled in effect.

8 For the relygyouse mourtherers that of cruelnesse caused the blood of thy
holy* Saints and Prophets / Apostles and Preachers to be shed / have now
by thy just appointment very blood to drink as they are most worthy.

9 For sleynge of them whose massage they contempned / they had their just
plage. Not o^lye became they vain in their thoughts / their folyshe hearts
darkened (not unlike to them that has ears a^dheare not / eyes and se not)
but also there remained unto them after this life a perpetual vengeance
without mercy for their cruel oppressyons / as a due reward of their error.

10 Yet an other Angel hard I (says Saint Ioha^) eue^ out of the altar
which is Christ. This Angel sygnyfyeth those witnesses that su^tyme confessed
the truth here / and now rests from their labors in the lord. These though
they be departed / afferme that the other has said before. In token that now
being departed they forget not that truth which they before confessed /
living still yet in the same. He that holds my word (says Christ) shall
never taste of death.

11 And this is their saying in mystery / or words comprehendinge their
secret confession.

12 Even so lord God almyghtye. As the living beleuers says of the by mouth
/ so say we now in the sprete.

13 That thy decreed judgments are ever more true / and thy maruelouse
workings ryghtouse. The first is called in some translacyons the Angel of
waters / the other here reported to come from the altar / to sygnyfye both
sorts.

The Text.
1 And the fourth Angel poured out his vyall. 2. on the sun. 3. And power
was given unto him to vex men with heat of fire. 4. And the men raged in
great heat / and spoke evil of the name of God. 5. which had power over those
plages. 6. and they repented not / to give him glory.

The Paraphrase.
1 Consequentlye by the appointment of God / the fort Angel in the forth Seal
opening poured out his vyall of Gods wrath on the sun. As the lord had
eternallye prefixed / in the forth age of the Christen church. For the whole
worlds pannyshme^t / was Christ sore blemyshed which is the clear sun of
ryghtousnesse. Sore ded the dissembling. Antichrists in those days darken
the true glory of God with their many fold sects of Hipocresye. The pope had
for his part an innumerable swarm of shorn smered Sodomytes / and Mahomete a
foul flock of frantyck fabyllers / which with their newlye painted relygyons
and prodygyouse obseruacyons / made first all the world to wonder and than to
worship Bel^al for Christ / taking darkness for light / and sin for
ryghtousnesse.

2 These being very adversaries unto Christ / took upon them his auctoryte
and seat / the one boastynge himself for his general vycar in earth / the
other for the great Prophet of the lord / and so were received of the
excecate world. Needs would they seem to be the su^ne / being the very
shadows of death.

3 Permytted was this heersackye sun to vex me^ne with heat of fire.
Sitting in the temple of God which is with in manne / with soche wicked laws
as they made under the name of God and of Christ / they terribly vexed /
tormented / and cruciated the weak consciences of men / leaving them
co^mo^lye in most peynefull desperacyon.

4 So that the men raged in great heat / speaking evil of the name of God
/ which had power over those plages. At their abominable persuasions was
Christ of them not taken for a merciful sauer and gentle* redemer / but for a
froward chorle and intractable tyrau^t / unless he were mollyfyed by the
merytes and callynges upon of other / and that could not be had without money.

5 Power has the lord over plages / to hold them or remove them. By his
ryghtfull judgment / at his only pleasure he hardens. As the potter / may
he break them / or make them vessels of dishonor.

6 In no wise ded this perverted multitude repent their wicked blasphemies to
give him glory / for all their confessio^s / Mass hearynges / pylgrymages and
satisfaccyons without nombre. For they were not according to his prescripcyon.

7 After non other sort will he be pleased and glorified / than he has by his
scripturs appointed. Nothing less are their fantasyes than true repentance.

The Text.
1 And the fifte Angel poured out his vyall. 2. upon the seat of the Beast.
3. and his kyngedome waxed dark. 4. And they gnewe their tongues for sorrow 5.
and blasphemed the God of heaven for sorrow / and pain of their sores. 6. and
repented not of their deeds.

The Paraphrase.
1 In order succedeth by the dyuyne ordinance the fi^t Angel under the fifth
seal opening / pourynge out his vyall of Gods indignacyon upon the seat of
the Beast. After non other sort than the lord had before predyffyned for man's
unfaithfulness sake / was the proud beastlye kyngodome of the Papacye / and
the execrable regne of Mahomete replenyshed with all filthye abhomynacyo^s
under the sun. For in the other age before they ded but crepe into the hearts
of me^ne through the glytterynges of hypocresye and dissimulate sanctyte.

2 But here have they obtained the power / seat / and auctoryte of the Beast /
and so gotten unto them the mighty Monarchies of the universal world. Here
reigned they without check in all vain glory / hawtynesse / malice / pride /
murder Hipocresye / superstycyon / Idolatrye / and blasphemye of Gods name.

3 And therefore their kyngedomes as all one in deuylllyshenesse / became all
dark / without the light of Gods veryte / full of the stynkinge smoke of the
bottomless pytte. Than went the locustes abroad / and filled the world with
ygnoraunce and blyndenesse.

4 Every where gnewe they their to^ges for very sorrow. In detractynge the
veryte / much grefe they suffered in their desperate hearts their worms not
dyenge / nor their fire quenched / the scorpyons of the earth stynginge them
also.

5 Spyghtfullye they blasphemed the omnipotent lord of heaven for very
anguishe and dolor of their sores and wounds. For non other are the fruits of
a desperate conscience than blasphemies of God / as in Cain / Judas / and soche
other like. Non other are the vtteraunces of an vnpenyten^ heart / but heavy
hateful mormurynges.

6 And therefore yt follows / that they repented them not of their deeds. For in
a crucyate or fearfullye vexed conscience can never dwell true repentance. So
vnquietouse always is the folyshe desperate mind / as is the troubled ragynge
see. A wicked heart is lade^ with sorrows heapynge sin upon sin / the
Synagoge of proud Hipocrytes having no health. In the fifth Seal opening and
Trompet blowynge / is more of this misterye declared / which agrees much with
this vyall of God / like as does the other with the other in their nombres
though not in their figurs.

1 And the sixte Angel poured out his vyall. 2. upon the great river of
Euphrates. 3. and the water dried up. 4 that the way of the kings. 5. of the
East should be prepared. 6. And I saw three unclean spretes like frogs. 7.
come out of the mouth of the Dragon. 8 and out of the mouth of the beast. 9.
and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 10. for they are the spretes of
deuyls. 11. workynge miracles to go out. 12. unto the kings of the earth /

1 In course now follows the sixth angel of Gods appointment / under the ^ixt
seal openinge / shedinge out his Irefull vyall upon the great river Euphra^es
a flood of the Assyrianes or of Babylon / betokeninge in mysterye the plesa^nt
possessions and wauerynge delyghtes of the Papysticall clergy with soche like.

^ Into all filthye despres of carnal and worldly lusts gave the lord their
har^s over in the sixth age of the christian chur^he for their vnbeleues sake /
to do those things which are vncomlye and be^stlye. So that all their stodye /
travail / and labor / sought to non other end / ^ut only to habunde in
them. Wholly^ ^ere they given thereunto / and nothyn^^ to the glory of God in
all their practysed obseruacions.

3 Yet were the waters thereof in process of time dried up. Their welthye
pon^pes / possessions / and pleasurs (their fa^^se feats ones known) are and
shall be clerelye taken away from them. For after Jesus Syrach / the plant of
sinn^ shall be roted out in the proud Sinagoge of the wicked.

4 And all this shall be to prepare the way of the kings / from the spring
of the sun. Never shall the gouerners walk in the ways of the lord / nor
rewle according to Christ's doctrine nor yet that doctrine be apert and open
till the waters be dried up / not one dro^^pe remayninge. So long as the
Pre^^stes dwell in wanton delights and va^^ne pleasurs / either are the
princes chyl^dyshe or else tyrannouse / according a^ their needs requires.

5 Never are they kings from the spri^^ge of the Sun / or according to
Chri^stes rewle / seeking Gods honor wyt^ David and Josias. In England by the
Gospel preaching have many of th^se waters been dried up in the suppres^sion
of monasteryes / prioryes / couen^tes / and fryres howses / yet are not a^^
things brought unto Christ's cler^ institucyon. A sincere Christen orde^ can
not yet be seane there. And a great cause why. For all is not yet dried up
there. The Bishops regne still in as much vain gloryouse pomp / and with
as many heythnyshe obseruacions as ever they ded. As cruellye hearted and as
bloudye minded are they yet as ever they were before / no myschef unsought to
hold in the waters. Mark how Wynchester / Durham / York / London / and
Lyncolne works / with soche other plesauntlye dysposed Euphratynes. But be of
good confort and pray in the mean time. For the holy Ghost promyseth here
they shall wydder away / with all that the heavenly father has not planted.
All that generacyon will the lords breath^ consume. Now is the axe laid to
the root of the tree / to hew down the unfruitful branches / the wyddred
reserved to unquenchable fire. God grant the princes at that day more
christenlye to bestow the waters of Euphrates than they have yet been bestowed
/ no prouysyon made for the poor / nor yet order set for the Gospel
preaching. For great part of it is now turned to the vpholdynge of dyse
playnge / maskynge / and banketynge / yea^ I would I could not by just
ocrasyons speak it brybynge / whorynge / and swearinge / the towns / peples /
and howseholdes miserablye decayed / which will not one day / be vnplaged /
unless they repent.

6 Fardermore I saw (says Saint Johan) in the same self visyon / three
unclean spretes / one coming out of the dra^ons mouth which signifies
Satan the devil / an other out of the Beasts mouth betokeninge the
universal Antichrist / and the third out of the false prophets mouth
compared before to the two horned Beast. And all they seemed in manner as frogs
/ both in their colors and facyons.

7 Idolatrye was that ill sprete which first went out from the Serpent / and
has co^tynued ever sens in the world under the color of good works / as
pilgrimage / devotion / and labor.

8 Error in abominable fylthynesse was the sprete which came from the
beastly Antichrist defilynge the whole christianite with innumerable
supersticions under the color of chaste living / in presthode / sacrifices /
and ceremonies.

9 Hypocrisye was the foul sprete which yssewed fromthe false preachers /
poysoninge the catholyke faith with false doctrine under the color of
relygion / pretendinge abstinence / prayer / and clennesse. These.iij. wicked
spretes are not all unlike to the wild fire / smoke / and brymstone / which
the terryble ferce horses euometed in the.ix. chapter of this present
prophecye* For cursed / false / and vnpure they are. Their doctrine is
wickedness / lies / and deuylishnesse / and the execrable wisdom of the
flesh. In manner of frogs are they here descrybed for their dyuersite of
colors in ceremonies / doctrynes / and sects / for their filthye dwelling in
the dyrtye tradycions of men / and for crookelynge of their unknown
psalmodye and service / dysquietynge with their idle customs the consciences
of the simple multitude.

10 These are the very spretes of deuyls / the ympes of Satan workynge soche
signs and miracles as would deceive the very chosen persons and bring them
into error if it were so possible. But the lord evermore defends his.

11 A strong power have they by the workynge of Satan to show lyenge wonders
and deceyuable signs among them that shall peryshe for detestynge the truth.

10 These shall by the permissio^ of God be suffered to go at large / they shall
strongelye delude the kings of the earth / and blind the governors of the
vny^ersall world / making them dronken with the cup of all abhomynacyons.

13 And all this shall they do to gather them together by their wicked counsels
/ and to bring them into one cruel consent of battaylynge against Christ and
his members / to receive the penalte thereof in the great day of the lord
almyghtye.

14 Most busylye they gather them to battle / when they move them to
persecute the just beleuers with full ungodly acts / as now most of all in
owrage / which God has promised in short space to revenge. Of this will more
be spoken in the.xix. chapter following. Least any manne knowing the truth
should tangle his own conscience with their spiritual sorceryes for fear of
princes laws / under the vain hope of repentance in the end of their lives
/ yt follows in plain sentence.

15 Behold (says the lord Jesus Christ) or ernestlye take heed unto it / for
I come daungerouslye unlooked for / as commonly does the thief / to thy
hyndraunce if thu watch not in faith / but live in superstycyon. Though this
/ not without reasonable cause may be taken in a geueralte for the last
judgment day / yet is it here spoken partycularlye of every man's
departing. As a premonyshment / he gives this here of love / least any manne
should peryshe without warning.

16 Blessed is he (says that Lord) which watches in the true christen believe
/ and lives not in the vain but in the sure hope of life / sealed with the
just promyses of God. For all that he ^oth shall prospere / and turn him to
great advantage in the conclusyon.

17 Happy is he also that holds fast unto him his garments / or works of
Gods prescripcion (which are the fruits of the sprete) or that has done on the
Lord Jesus Christ / gyrdynge him sure unto him self by faith.

18 Least he be fownde a naked hypocrite without faith / veryte / justice /
charity / with soche like / or least the ryghtouse nombre at the latter day se
his filthiness uncovered / and rejoice at his condempnacion.

19 He is blessed which at that day shall be covered with the whight garment
of the lamb / not having his sins imputed unto him.

20 To show the certente of the aforesaid battle / Saint Johan says tha^
the devil gathered together those wicked newlers into a serten place called in
the Hebr^^ ^onge Armagedon. The unclean spretes that before are named three of
their diverse workinge in the Dragon / Beast / and false prophe^e are here
brought into one / as all of one lyenge sprete who^ Christ calls the father
devil. This one lyenge sprete which has been a murderer from the beginning
/ comprehendynge in him all unclean spretes / like as does the Beast all
Antichrists / has co^byned together into ^n exe^rable zele of fatherlye
tradicyons / all vain gloryouse and ungodly minded governors against God and
his Christ. And this has not been without the secret permission of God /
willing to prove his electes by strong sufferynges / that they might receive
at his hand the reward of strong victory / or of his habundaunt riches.

21 This place here called in the Hebrew Armagedon betokens in misterye an
hill of dylectable fruits / interpreted of some for the hill of the Gospel /
and is commonly taken of the Hebrews for that is sweet or of value. And this
without fail is the church / which often times in the scripturs is called the
plentuouse hill of God / the hill of Gods house / the hill of myrhe / the hill
of oly^es / the hill of Syon / Carmelus / and ^thanus with soche other like. In
this mount evermore are they bent to battle. There slay they the innocent
lambs of Christ. All their power / malice / and tyranny / is there extremely
vttred at the Antichrists labor and desire / which are excedynglye dronken
in the blood of holy martyrs / which has been shed upon earth from
ryghtouse Abell unto this day. But when the almyghtye sets kings upon the
earth / it shall be clear even in the darkness / that the hill of Basan is
Gods hill.

The Paraphrase.
1 Finallye the seventh Angel went forth under the seventh seal opening as
God had eternally determined / throwynge out the content of his vyall into the
air. For the seventh age of the christen church by the very set purpose of
God / are many converted to the truth / and become with Paul the vessels of
eleccion / that before were with Judas the vessels of wrath under the great
aduersarye of God. Neither is it any blemishe unto them to be called here that
they were before / vyals of wrath / considering that Simon leprosus / being
ones healed of his leprosye was ever after called a leper. In case like / Paul
after his conuersyon was not ashamed to report him self both a Pharyse and also
the son of a Pharyse.

2 These / by the mighty determynacion of Gods strong judgment / are sent
into the air. Most effectuallye are they lyghtened with the sprete of God /
and provoked stiflye to stand up against the aereall powers regnynge in the
fyckle fantastical Antychrystes and hypocrytes / conde^pninge by Gods word
their universal doctrines and deuyllyshnesse. These powers are no less than
deuyls / who^ Christ calls fowls of the air / Peter a^ Ioha^ mannis
adversaries / and saint Paul the gouerners of the es^ darkenesses in
spyrytuall wickedness.

3 Whils these things are in doing / out of heaven which is the universal
congregation / yea from the very trone of God which is the elect faithful
nombre (for they are only the seat of God) came a voice of reioysinge /
saying after this sort.

4 It is done. All things are fynyshed. Christ's glory ones manyfestlye
known / ^ke world is at an end.

The wicked has done all their myscheffes / and the nombre of owr brethren is
fulfilled. Thus shall they preach a full delyueraunce of the captyues / and
the peceable year of the lord. This is the silence of an half hour space
mencyoned before in the.viij. chapter / and the return of this world unto
Christ in the.xij. Chapter. Not that there shall in those days be no enemies
(for the remnaunt shall still remain) but that they shall not then openly
dare rage / persecute / and kill / the world being at so the a universal
quiet.

5 Yet shall there happen in those days voices / thonderynges / and
lyghtenynges. Voices of sweet blessings and dylectable promyses to the
faithful congregacyon. Thonderynges of terror to the unfaithful multitude /
commaundynge things contrary to the flesh. And fearful lyghtenynges of
condempnacyon to the reprobate hypocrytes and desperate obstinates.

9 And all from one word of the lord or one Gospel preaching in diverse
respects / no small earthquake following upon the same. What commocyons /
heuye complayntes / fearful tremblynges / sorrows / cries / grefes /
syghynges / waylynges / grudgynges / gruntynges / gronynges / wepynges / and
hands wryngynge will be among the earthlye minded Antichrists and hypocrites
/ bishops / prestes / prelates / holy water mongers / and parryshe clerks /
lawers / whores / caruers / paynters / and wax sellers / when their who^ishe
church shall be turned over by the judgment of the said word / yt is easy
to conjecture.

7 Soche a one will this earthquake be (says the text) so mighty and so
strong / as never was yet sens men war upon the earth / or sens that
earthlye generacyon first began. Than shall be clean taken away the carnal
church of Antychryst or the smered Sinagoge of sha^elynges. Neither shall the
Pope with his dysgysed rabble any more be seane here / nor yet Mah^mete with
his monstruouse muster.

8 In soche wise shall their laws / secdes / and ceremonies be destroyed in
those days / that no man shall be fownde so bold as ones to allow one of
the^ openly. Than shall the glory of christ's name shine the world over / he
making of his enemies / his f^te stole.

9 More over in this terrible earthquake the great spyrytuall cite called
Sodom and Egypt / or the holy whoryshe mother the church shall be disseuered
into in parts / of the which.ij. shall still be wicked / the third converted
unto godliness. Two parts shall be dispersed (says Zacharye) the third
shall remain to the lord. Of them which have and shall go out of mynsters and
monasteryes / collegys and couentes / churches and cloisters / patryshes and
nonneryes / one sort shall inwardlye be given to Antichrists
superstycyousnesse and Hipocresye. An other sort upon diverse fleshelye
consideracyons / shall faynedlye fall to the Gospel. The third sort only of
love toward God and zele of health in their neybers / shall unfeignedly
cleave to the Scripturs. Thus shall the ungodly sort be coupled still with the
Godly in every land and prouynce and be the much greatter no^bre. Yet shall
they for that time attempt nothing against them / the trewthe so strongelye
regnynge. Never thelesse yet is yt not to be thought that they shall than have
nothing to suffer / considering that it is a kyngedome of sufferaunce. Christ
to head of that congregacyon suffered oned incommodyte or other always / so
long as he was here living. It shall therefore behoue the^ / which are his
mystical members / always to suffer. For the servant is no better than his
lord / nor the soldier tha^ his head captain. And to make his good / the
lord says in Zacharye. The same third part will I lead through fire / and
pourge yt as silver or gold in the furnace. Than shall every godly creature
follow Christ in bearing his cross. They shall mortyfye their fleshlye
members / s^^ynge all fornicacyon / fylthynesse / Idolatre / covetousness /
pride / anger / and malice. They shall help / suffer / and forbear one an
other / having pytefull compassion upon the weak / sick / and nedye. No
duty besemynge a chrystyane shall they leave undone.

10 Therefore this great or general cite thus divided / all other particular or
nacyonall cytees must also fall. The blasphemouse Pantheon of Rome ones
peryshinge / all other churches of the unfaithful must needs follow sone after
in their course. For the found acyon taken a way / the building can not
endure. So that from thens forth shall be no popyshe sects / no supersticiouse
ceremonies / no heythnyshe obseruacions / nor open Idolatrye in all the world.
But when the remnaunt of the wicked shall attempt a fresh to raise up again
soche abhomynacions / the lord shall so^enlye without warning fall upon them
with his most fearful and terryble last judgment.

11 Great Babylon the aforesaid mother of all whoredom and fylthynesse / shall
than come in remembrance before God. He shall than consider her abhomynable
blasphemye / her pride / cruelte / murder / and sins without nombre /
wayenge them in right balaunce according unto justice.

12 He shall also reward her to drink / the fearce cup of his wrath or
wine of his great indignacyon / which is the perpetual death of soul. The
very dregs of his Ire shall she taste / yea unspeakable sorrows and peynes
without end. For non other is it to come in remembrance before him at that
day / but to be condemned / and receive ponnyshment according to her deeds.

13 Tha^ shall leuerye I Will (which is a place of refuge within the sea) flee
away and not tarry. The mountains that are wont to give socour unto the^
that be on the land / shall not at that day be fownde. No confort shall she
than have nor sure help any where.

14 No remedy will be at that day to flee from the fearful face of the
judge. Than will neither merytes nor ye^ soul Masses help / neither
blessings nor knelynges / sacrifices nor se^synges / wawlynges nor ryngynges /
bussinges nor synginges / but will she nyll she / needs must she abide his
heuye and terrible sentence.

15 And there fell great hayle (says the text) as yt had been wayghtye
talentes. Always must yt be remembered that co^mo^lye the time past is used in
this prophecye for the time to come / for the te^tente of the things here
spoken. This hayle is non other than the heuye tempest or plage of the said
fearful and terryble judgments of the lord / which shall on that woofull
day fall suddenly ^s a thycke hayle upon the miserable multitude of them that
boasted themselves to be the holy church / and upon their wicked folowers
compared here unto Babylon.

16 This plage is here also for non other cause lykened unto talentes / bu^^^r
that yt is in wayght and measure to be mynystred unto them by the preordynacyon
of God. So much pain and sorrow is due unto that whoryshe generacyon / as she
has glorified herself in filthy delyghtes / and so many ponnyshmentes to be
rewarded her. Yea / double must she have according to her works.

17 Out of heaven shall this vehement hayle fall / from the fearful sentence
of the lord Jesus Christ / which shall than sit as a judge in the mids of
his faithful congregacyon / they sittynge with him as the body with the head
in condempnacyon of the wicked.

18 And upon the men shall yt light. For the great whore or the cite called
here Babylon / is in this place to be taken for that yt comprehends / even
for men / in whom also are included women by the common usage of the
Scripturs.

19 These men shall spyghtfullye blaspheme God because of the hayle / plage /
or terror of their torments. They shall cry out of him / wysshinge that he
had no soche power so to torment them.

20 For the tempest is great / and the su^^feraunce thereof exceeding paynefull.
As the lord is mighty / so are his iudge^mentes when they fall. Vehement /
ferce and strong is the lord (says Esaye) (...) is the tempest of hayle
breaking ou^ (...) every side / and bearinge down strong holds.

The.xvij. Chapter.
Often has occasyons be given me in this book to speak of great Babylon / and
of the exec^able Beast / but here is place offered to describe the^ more at
large.



The Text.
1 And there came one of the seven Angels / which had the seven vyalles. 2. and
talked with me. 3. saying unto me. 4. Come. I will show the. the judgment.
5. of the great whore. 6. that sytteth upon many waters. 7. with whom the
kings of the earth have committed whoredom. 8. and the inhabyters of the
earth are dronken with the wine of her fornicacion. 9. And he carried me away.
10. into the wilderness in the sprete.

The Paraphrase
1 After this came (says Saint Johan) one of the.vij. Angels or vnuaryable
decrees of the lords eternal judgments / which had the.vij. vyals of his
wrath as before has been declared.

2 And this Angel or set purpose of God / as an heaue^lye massenger talked
with me in mysterye.

3 Of favorable goodness in secret manner he assertayned me therbye of this
wonderful judgment here folowinge / to be fulfilled at the latter end of the
world. And thus yt said unto me.

4. Come hither frynde Johan / I will show the in secretenesse the terryble
judgment of the great whore or cou^terfett church of Hipocrites / as God has
appointed yt. Needs must this whore b^ Rome / for that which is here after
spoken / that she is the great cite which re^neth over the kings of the
earth. Evident yt is both by the scripturs and chronicles / that in Iohans
days Rome had her domynyon over all the whole world. And being infected with
the abhominacyons of all lands / ryghtlye is she called Babylon or cite of
confusion / not only in this reuelacyon but also in the first Epistle of
Peter. And like as in the scripturs often times under the name of Jerusalem is
meant the whole kingedome of Judah / so under the name of Rome here may be
understood the universal world with all their abhominacyons and
deuylyshenesses / their Idolatries / withchecraftes / sects / supe^stycyons /
papacyes / presthodes relygyons / shauinges / anoyntings / blessings /
sensings / processions / and the devil and all of soche beggeries. For all
peples se^s Christ's ascencyon has this Rome infected with her pestylent
poisons gathered from all Idolatrouse nacyons soche time as she held over the^
the monarchyall suppremyte. And like as Babylon had the Israelytes captyue
under a bodylye trybute / so has this Rome had the Christianes both in their
bodies and sowles. At the writynge of this Prophe^ye felt Johan of their
cruelte being exyled into Pathmos an I Will of Lycya for the faithful testymonye
of Jesus. And so ded I poor creature with my poor wife and children at the
gatheringe of this. present Commentarye / fleing into Germanye for the same.

5 No maruele though she be here called a great whore. For no where were ever
yet seane so many Idolle wurshyppynges so many vain obseruacyons so many
superslycyouse sects / so many errors in Hipocresye / so many false
Prophets / and so many prodygyouse kinds of fylthynesse / no / not in Sodom
yt self nor yet in miserable Egypt.

6 This Babylonyshe whore or disgised Synagoge of shorelynges / sits upon
many waters or peples that are fantastical / fyckle or folyshe. For no^ are
in conscience subject unto her / that are consta^tlye grounded in the sure
doctrine of faith. Only allows her tradycyons the wauerynge witted
multitude / the slypper and vnstedefast no^bre / obeynge the^ in their hearts
of fear and not of love / so throwynge themselves into a most co^fuse Chaos or
vawte, of doubtful do^rage.

7 With this stynkynge strompett have the mighty potentates of the universal
earth / the Emprours / Kings / Princes / and other notable governors
committed most shameful whoredom in the sprete by many strange worship
pynges / agreynge among themselves to her wyckedlye decreed laws and
customs. To long should we stand here in this place / if we should describe
them all seuerallye in their colors at large as they be.

8 Through the craftye legardemayne of the Prestes on the one side / and the
cruel constytucyo^s of Princes on the other side / the dwellers of the earth
or worldly minded multitude are dronken with the wine of her fornycacyon
spyrituall / or practysed worshypyynges besides the prescripte rewles of Gods
word. Not only they which have been couetouse / carnal / lewd / and
wretched has followed their abhomynacyo^s / but also an innumerable sort of the
elect nombre has believed their lies and errors. Yea / they have been so
dased with their dottages / and so tangled with their customs / that as men
losing their wits without all godly remembrance / reason / wisdom /
dyscressyon / understanding / judgment / and grace / the laws of God laid a
part / the co^maundeme^ts neglected and the scripturs despised / they have no^
only kneled / crossed / kyssed / set up lyg^tes / and holden up their hands
before rotten posts / but also called them their fathers in heaven. Yea (I axe
God mercy^ a thousand times) I have been one o^ them myself. And this is to
this day ^ principal religyo^ of that whoryshe chu^^che / called deuowte
pilgrymage or ho^lye stacyons of prayer / many great pa^^dons granted and
many false promy^ses made to allure the people thervnto^

9 But blessed be the lord / whose wo^^de in this age both admonyshed many^ as
the Angel ded Johan / and brough^ them also clean from her abhominacy^ons /
into a secret consideracyon of the sprete / unknown to the world / ther^
both to se her pride and also to vnder^stande her judgment. For yt follows i^
the text / that the angel co^uayed Johan away into the wilderness in the
spret^^

10 In mysterye here the holy ghost d^^clared before what the lord should work^
in me^ne having his grace / at the latte^ days of the world. Into the
wylderne^^se flee they with David / which leauy^^ge the customed ways of men
/ afte^ the course of the scripturs seek up their lord God in faith /
worshyppinge him only in sprete and in veryte.

The Paraphrase.
1 And I saw / says Saint Johan / in mysterye a woman (for an whore at the
first blushe seems only a woman) syetynge upon a rose colored Beast. This
Beast is the great Antichrist that was spoken of before / or the Beastlye body
of the devil / comprehendynge in him Popes / Patriarchs / Cardynalles /
legates / Bishops / Doctors / Abbottes / Pryors / Prystes and Pardoners /
Monks / Chanons / Fryres / Nonnes / and so forth. Temporal gouerners also /
as Emprours / Kings / Princes / Dukes / earls / lords / justices / deputyes /
judges / lawers / mayers / balyues / constables / and so forth / leaving their
own dewtyed offices as to mynyster ryghtlye / to serve their abhominacyons.

2 All rose colored is this Beast / in token of tyrannouse murder and blood
shedynge over those that will not agree to their deuyllyshnesse.

3 Full of blasphemouse names is this Beast also / as your holiness / your
grace / your lordeshyp / your fatherhode / your mastershyp / your reverence /
honor / highness / worship / magnyficence / goodness / Gods vycar /
spiritual sir / ghostlye father / phesycyan of sowles / defender of faith /
head of the holy church / and so forth / besides the names of their
propyrtees / feats / and pagentes / as processyon / byshoppynge / anelynge /
purgatory / pilgrimage / pardon / Mass / mattens / eue^songe / placebo /
candelmasse day / palm sunday / ash wedynsdaye / holy roode day / Saint
Thomas day / and so forth.

4 This Beast had.vij. heads and ten horns / sygnyfyenge his universal
crafts and suggestyons to destroy the graces and gifts of the holy ghost /
and also his falselye borrowed primacyes and tyrannouse auctorytees to
withstand the commandementes of God.

5 Upon this Beast sits a woman. For what else auaunceth or bears out this
malygnaunt muster* in their copes / crosses / oils / myters / robes /
rellyckes / ceremonies / vygyls / holy days / blessings / sensynges / and
folynges / but a wanton folyshe and fantastycall relygyon / a vain gloryouse
pomp / and a shynynge pretense of holiness in superstycyo^ calling yt their
holy church? She is said here to sit upon this bloudye Beast / as to be
stayed / quyeted / and satled by them. Mark what labors and peynes that
craftye and wylye Winchester takes with Bo^ner To^stall and other of his
faccyon / as her own sworn ^ouldy our to hold up this gloryouse whore in her
old estate of ^omyshe religyon. Oh / he grunteth and groueth / he sweteth and
swells / he fretteth and belleth / he blows and pants / he calke^^s and
^a^teth / he sturreth and never cease / to bring his matters to pass.

6 In token that this hipocriticall church stands in the murder of
innocents / this woman is here gorgyouslye appareled in purple / as gyltye of
their deaths which has been slain / and also in fresh scarlett as evermore
fresh and rydye to continue in the same blood shedyng. For if soche terrible
slaughter were not / the true Christen faith should increase / to the great
dymynyshment of her glory.

7 She is in like case floryhshynglye decked with gold / precyouse stone / and
pearls / not only in her manyfolde kinds of ornaments / as in her copes /
corporasses / chesybles / tunicles / stools / fannoms and myters / but also in
mysterye of cou^terfett godliness. Many outward bragges makes this painted
church of Christ / of his gospel / and of his Apostles / sygnyfyed by the
gold / precyouse stone / and pearls / which is but a glytterynge color. For
nothing minds she less than to follow them in conuersacyon of lyuinge.

8 More over ^n her hand which is he exteryoure mynistracyon / she has a
golden cup / full of abhomynacyons and fylthynesse of her execrable
whoredom. This cup is the false relygyon that she daily mynistreth /
besides the chalyce whom her merchantes most dampnablye abuses. And yt
contains all doctrine of deuyls / all Beastlye errors and lies / all
deceytfull power / all glytterynge works of Hipocrites / all craftye wisdom
of the flesh / and subtyle practyses of man's wit / besides philosophye /
logyck / rhetoryck / and sophystry. Yea / all prodygiouse kinds of Idolatrye /
fornicacyon / sodometrye / and wickedness. Outwardlye yt seems gold /
pretendynge the glory of God / the holy name of Christ / the sacred scripturs
of the Bible / perpetual virgynyte of life / and all are but counterfeit
colors and shadows of Hipocresye in the outward letter and name.

9 Full of abhominacyons is the drink of the execrable faith of that Romyshe
relygio^ received of other / and full of fylthynesse also. For both retayneth
the people thereof innumerable kinds of Idol worshippinges under the title of
Gods service / and also their shauelyn^ges of prodygyouse beastlynesse in
lech^^rouse living under the color of cha^^tyte. Here were much to be
spoken o^ Saint Germans evil / Saint Sithe keye / Saint D^c^mbers ores /
maste^ Johan shornes bote / Saint Gertrude rattes / Saint Job for the pox /
Sayn^ Fyacre for the ague / Saint Apolyne for tothe^ake / saint Gracyane for
lost thrif^ Saint walstone for good harvest / sayn^ Cornelis for the foul
evil / and all o^ther Saints else almost.

10 Of the buggerye boys also amon^ge prelates and prestes / ghostlye father
and relygyouse / might much be said h^^re / were yt not for infectynge me^nes
e^^es / ears and understandings. For all th^se noyfull nocumentes are the
holy fr^^res of the whoredom of that holy^whoryshe church.

11 In the forehead of this glytteryng whore / which is her outward shew^ is
written a name / expresselye decla^rynge what she is. By her ungodly fr^^res
is she known to the elect seruan^tes of God / having the light of the
Scripture* In their consciences aperet^ she non other than a postyferouse
who^re / by the judgments of the same.

12 Averye mis^^^ye is this show to the infydels / an hydden secret / an
vnkno^ne wonder. For they are so blinded with her foppryes and tangled with her
toys / that they judge all that she does / holy / relygyouse / and perfygh^.
And all this suffers God for their vnbeleues sake / destroyenge nevertheless
the wisdom of the wise and prudence of the prudent in his.

13 Her very name agreynge to her fruits / is this. Great Babylon / in
myschete far above the cite of the Cha^deanes / and much more full of
confusyon. For she is the oryginall mother / the cause / the beginning / the
rote / the spring / and the fountain of all spiritual fornyca^yo^s / and in
a manner of all fleshlye abhominacyons also done upon the earth. This is to the
faithful sort / as a written name of her / euydent / clear open and manifest.
But to the unfaithful yt is only as a mysterye / hydde^ / dark / obscure /
and neglect. For so are the secrets that God opens to babes / and hydeth
from the wise.

14 And I (says Saint Johan) perceived yt euidentlye in mi fore understanding
/ that this woman the very wise of the devil and of his beastlye body (for
the Bishops are the husbands of their Romyshe churches) was all dronken in
the bloudye slaughter of the Saints / or ernest Christian beleuers / and in the
exceeding tyrannouse murder of the faithful witnesses of Jesus or syncere^
preachers of his word. For neither o^ both she spares. Besides all Godly^
wisdom is she / and forgetful of her self / through this same bloudye
dronke^^nesse / so great excess has she taken.

15 And when I perseyued and saw her with all her adders whelps so beas^^ty
she (says Saint Johan) with exceeding wonder I marueled. Not only tha^ she
was thus ouersett with blood drin^kinge or outragyouse murtherynge o^
innocents / but also of her exceeding great abhomynacyons.

16 And most of all I wondered that the almyghtye God could with so much
pa^cyence suffer her in soche myschefe.

The Text.
1 And the Angel said unto me. 2. wherefore meruaylest thu: 3. I will show the
/ the mysterye of the woman / and of the Beast that bears her / which has
seven heads and ten horns. 4. The beast that thu see it / was. 5. and is not.
6. and shall ascend out of the bottomless ^ytte. 7 and shall go into
perdi^yon. 8. And they that dwell on ^he earth shall wondre. 9. whose names
are not wryt^en in the book of life from the ^egynnynge of the world). 10.
when they behold the Beast that was / and is not.

The Paraphrase.
1 And as I was thus with my sel^ ^aruelynge / the Angel or a fore named ^ecre
of the Lord said unto me these words.

^ Wherefore do thu thus maruele / thu mortal manne?

For thy gentle and meke expectacy^n I shall show unto the / the misterye of
this wretched woman / and of the cru^ll Beast that bears her / which has
^ij. heads and.x. horns. By this shall ^hu know the true church from the
^alse / the just preachers from the hypo^rites / the sincere doctrine from
their subtyle sophysmes / and their lawful an^ ^oryte from their cruellye
usurped presumpcyons. For that shows the lord unto his electes / that he
will not have known of all men.

4 The execrable Beast or carnal kyngedome of Antichrist which thu have se
a^ne here in misterye / was as concerning his beginning in Cain first of all
/ and so continued forth in the fleshlye children of men / in the chaplaynes
of Pharao / Hiero^oam / Baal / and Bell / in the cruel bishops / prestes /
and lawers with soche other like till the death of Christ and so forth.

5 And now the said Beast is not in power and auc^oryte as he has been. For in
Iohans time / serten years before the wrytinge of this reuelacyon / was the
proud clergy of the Jews utterly destroyed by Titus and Despasiane / in the
terrible syege of Jerusalem. Not with^standinge / yet shall this beast rise
again in the Romyshe pope and Mahomete / and in their false prelates and
doctors.

6 He shall ascend out of the bottomless pytte from the stinkynge den of
Satan / exalting him self in worship above all that is called God. But in the
conclusion he shall have an end.

7 Into perdicyon shall he go without fail. The Lord shall first utter his
wickedness (as now in this age) and than with the sprete of his mouth consume
him and destroy him. So that his high clymynge up / shall at the last be the
chief cause of his fall. Yet shall his wicked remnaunt ones again set up
their crystes / and persecute a fresh / but that shall ^^e no full raise unto
him.

8 And the rabble of reprobates which dwell on the earth / or for earthlye
commodytees contempneth Gods truth / shall wonder ones again not without
much inward rejoice / that their church ryseth again out of the old
hypocresyes.

9 Whose names are not regestred in Christ which is the large book of life /
and has been both the life and the lyghe of men sens the first constitucyon
of the moveable world. No / they are not nombred among those ryghtouse that
shall regne with him in glory.

10 These adversaries of God and his word shall have much gladness in their
wicked hearts / when they behold the Beast thus coming up again that was of
soche magnificence and now is but a thing of nowght / that was esteemed above
God / and now is proved dampnacyon. So long is this beastlye Antychryst / as
he works the mysterye of iniquite in the reprob^te vessel^ / and when he
leueth that workynge than is he no longar. Mark in this process past the
nature of Gods eternal decre for this age of his church. First it shows and
than it condempneth the cursed Sinagoge of the devil. In significacio^ whereof
the true preachers of our time has many festly opened her wickedness unto all
the world / whereupon her utter destruccyon must shortly follow. Watch good
Christen reader / and pray ernestlye.

The Text.
1 And here is a mind that has wisdom. 2. The seven heads are.vij.
mountains. 3 whereon the woman sytteth. 4. They are also seven kings. 5. Five
are fallen. 6. and one is. 7. and the other is not come. 8. When he comes /
he must continue a space. 9. And the Beast that was and is not / is even the
eight. 10. and is one of the seven. 11. and shall go into destruccyon.

The Paraphrase.
1 Here is a meaning which comprehends wisdom. A sincere vnderstaudynge
shall herin be requisyte. Necessary it is therefore to take heed / least thu
hold the harlot and Beast for that they boast them selves to be / to thy
dampnacyon.

2 The.vij. heads of the Beast aforemencyoned / by the plain diffinicyon of
the holy ghost are here to be taken for vii. mountains / or the universal
princelye monarchies of the.vij. clymates of the world.

3 Upon these the woman / that Babylonyshe harlot Rome (from whom has yssewed
all spirytuall whoredom) in most proud manner sits / having over them a
universal dominyon. For in Iohans time / to Rome was all the world subject.
Under whose cruel regne was Christ done to death / so has his faithful
members been ener sens by a new rayse^ kyngedome in the same.

4 These heads are also.vij. kings or goueunours of the aforesaid monorchyes
seduced by all kinds of craftye errors and deuylyshe suggestyons of that
Beast. So that y^y^ mark well this place / the head with the tail and the
cause with his effect / in these present significacyons shall no preiudyce be
found to that has been said in the other / though they seem very diverse.
For both the governors and also the lands / or the peples subject unto them
have universally been blinded by their wylye toytchecraftes. And so have the
worldly porentates with the spyrytuall Antychrystes agreed / that both they
have usurped one malygnau^t medlynge over the sowles of men to corrupt their
faith / the princes applyenge their powers unto the same. And that causes the
holy Ghost here to call them the beasts heads under the title of mountains
and kings. For under their princelye auctoritees has all their myschefes been
fulfilled to uphold this whore against Christ and his word.

5 Five of these heads are fallen from the universal monarchye of Rome. All
the dominyons of Africa and Asia has renounced the obedyence of her empire.
Only cleaves Europa unto her / which is the least of the three / and yet not
all thereof. When the Papacye grew / the whole empire of the Greeks called
Constantynople / fell clean from the la^nes / and became with other diverse
monarchies / the possession of Mahometes sect / or of the Agarenes and Turks.
Of the other empyres may a like conjecture be had. Thus have they declyned
from her / not so going forth nor yet rysynge up unto Christ / for only is it
said here / that they were fallen.

6 And one head is (says the text) at this present time remaining / the other
head is not come as yet / but will come her after. This head remayninge is the
sixth / and it is that feeble empire that Rome now holds / and have holden sens
Iohans time. The power of this empire is ruynouslye demynyshed / and the
notable fame thereof decayed betwixt the Popyshe prelates and the French men
/ a great part of the lands becommynge Saint Peter's patrimonye. To make it a
fytte head of the Beast to the vpholdynge of this whorishe church (the
auctoryte thereof maynteyninge her laws) Gregorye the fifth Pope committed the
emprours choosing unto.vi. princes of Germanye.iij. of them being
Archebyshoppes. He appointed also the king of Bohem for the seventh / than
being trybutarye unto him and his own feed man as an odd persons to way
upon their sides / if need / place / and time should require yt. Provided
always that he should take his oath and receive his crown imperyall at Rome.
So that now thowgh it still be the same in title that it was in Iohans days /
yet is it so diverse from it through dimynishment of power / and so unlike in
outward magnifycence / as it never had been the same.

7 The seventh head that is not yet come / is the Papysticall kyngedome of owr
Romyshe spiritualte. For thereof apered nothing in Iohans time / nor yet more
than.v. hondreth years after it. The Bishops of Rome (as they call them) from
Peter to Syluester / were very poor sowles / simple creaturs / and men not
regarded but despised of the world. They were no new law makers for the more
part / but rather they gave their whole dilygence to se those laws observed /
whom the holy ghost had made to their hands. Neither were they any Mass
sayers / soul syngers / or procession goers / but as was Saint Paul with the
other Apostles / simple preachers only / and for their sincere preaching /
they suffered the death of their bodies. But after the Donacyon of Co^stantyne
and other plentuouse almesses committed unto their hands for the socoure of
the poor / they became all confessors / and took them to their ease at home.
Than was labor very tedyouse unto them / preaching very troblouse and
peynefull. Than stodyed they all to please the powers / peceablye to hold
still their plesaunt possessions / and by spyrituall polycyes to increase them
more and more / the poor in a manner forgotten. Then came in that holy
ceremonye and that / with latten hours / serving of Saints / and prayenge
for the dead / to provoke men to offer to Corban. Thus crept they up in
hypocrisye day by day / till soche time as Johan of Constantinople contended
with Gregorye of Rome for the supremyte. In the which contencion thowgh
Gregorye laid for him self Saint Peter's keys with many other sore arguments
and reasons / yet was he commanded by Mauricius the Emperor after the
general Synod / to obey the said Johan / as the universal head bishop of
the whole world. Than were these holy fathers compelled to tarrye a layser /
and under craftye colors to wait their pray. In process of time when Phocas
was Emprour / Bonifacius the third a man of a wylye practyse / perceiving
him much given to bayne glory and covetousness / greatly also to dissalowe
the acts of Mauricius his predecessor / through flatterye and mede obtained
of him that the church of Rome should be holden from thens forth for the head
church of the world / and he for the head bishop. Wha^ this was ones gotten /
than rose they up so high / that the Emprour became their fore stole / and all
other christen princes their waiting ^laues / to ride and run / make and
mar / strive and fight / slay and kill / at their commandment and pleasure.
Thus became the Romyshe Pope the seventh king / that was in Iohans time yet to
come. If thu mark in the crouycles good reader / thu shall find that Phocas
the first Pope maker slew his master the Emprour Mauricius / signifyenge in my
sterye the said Pope making to be an utter destruccyon to the empire. The
Popes name was also at that time Bonifacius / which is as much to say as bona
facies / a good face. Which betokened that this new raised kyngedome should
show a fair face evermore / or a shynynge pretense of holiness / what
myschef so ever it wrought either against God or manne in abominable
supersticyon.

8 And when this seventh king comes (says the text) he must continue a
space / or abide a little season. He must have a time by the permyssion of God /
strongelye to delude the unbelievers / which will neither se nor hear / read
nor yet thankefullye receive his word of salvation / so gratyouslye offered
them. So corrupt are the fleshelye affectes of men / that much more prone
they are to lies and supersticyons / than to the veryte of the lord / which is
to be lamented. Christ came first in the name of his heavenly father / but him
will they not receive. The Pope comes in his own wicked name / and to him
run they by heaps. Whose contynuaunce here has been but a time. For yet is
it not a thowsande years sens the Papacye first began under Phocas / which is
but as a day before God / and that day will he shorten by his own promise for
his electes sake / which to remember is their great conforte. And a great cause
why. For sone after that shall they be fullye restored in to the perfyght
nombre of the children of God.

9 And the execrable beast (says the text) that of late days was in auctoryte
over all the world / yea / syttinge above God in the conscyences of men /
and now is become of no reputacyon among men (God openinge his myscheffes)
is even the eight in no^bre. And yet never the less is one of the.vij. heads.
For both is he the beastlye body it self comprehendynge in him the universal
abhominacyons of all the earthlye kyngedomes / and in that point diverse from
the seven heads / and so the.viij. in nombre.

10 And also he is one of the.vij. heads and the seventh in nombre / in
usurping this proud worldly kyngedome thus after a vain temporal sort.
Over and besides all this / may he also be called the eight in the cursed
remnaunt which after the peceable silence of christen lyberte (Satan loosoned)
shall most cruellye persecute Christ's congregacyon a fresh / as in the.xx.
chapter here following will apere.

11 This Beast with his carryage / the Antichrist with his church / or Satan
with his Sinagoge / shall not only go in to destruccyon here by the mighty
breathe of Gods mouth / or the true preachinge of his Gospel / but also
into dampnacyon everlasting in the end of the world with the devil and his
angels.

The Text.
1 And the ten horns which thu saw / are ten kings. 2. which have not yet
received the kyngedome. 3. but shall receive power. 4. as kings. 5. at one
hour with the Beast. 6. These have one mind. 7 and shall give their power and
stre^gthe unto the Beast. 8. These shall fight with the lamb. 9. and the lamb
shall overcome them. 10. For he is lord of all lords. 11. and king of all
kings. 12. And they that are on his side. 13. are called / and chosen / and
faithful.

The Paraphrase.
1 And the.x. horns) says the Angel unto Johan) which thu saw here upon
the heads of this rose colored Beast / are in significacyon.x. kings. Some
has taken these.x. kings for all those Emprours of the larynes sens Charle
main / which have sworn them selves obedyent to the Bishop of Rome. Some have
thought them to be those princes which here in Europa have before time been
subject to the Empire of Rome. As the kings of England / France / Spain /
Portyugale / Castele / Denmark / Scotland / Dngarye / Goheme / and Napels.
But these considre not that they be yet more in nombre / as Aragone / Nauerre /
Cycyle / Cypress / Sardyne / Swethen / Pole / and soche other / and are all
included in the seven heads as members of the before rehearsed empyres. Neither
mark they that they are above the heads as horns / and more in nombre than
the heads / betokenynge a rygorouse auctoryte and ferce power / which they
proudelye usurp over them every where. Before they were but suggestyons / but
here are they ernest doers. For in every region has the beastlye Antichrist
of Rome his Metropolytanes and primates. As in England are Caunterberye and
York / in France / Thuronensis and Remensis / in Spain Tholetanus and
Te^racone^sis / in Portingale Hispalensis and Bracarensis / in Irelande
Armachanus and Dublimensis / in Dennemarke Lundensis and Opsalensis / in
Germanye Colon^ensis and Maguntinus / in Hungarye Serigon^ensis and Colocensis
/ in Italye Pisanus and Rauennas / in Sycyle Panormitanus and Messanensis /
with an infynite nombre of bishops / prelates / prestes / and religiouse /
besides the fighting orders of the Rhodes / the Prussyanes / the Redemers of
captyues / the Aragondes / the Beorgyanes called de alga / the Monteseanes /
the Castylyanes / the Lusitaneanes / the Calatraneanes / and Saint James
warryours.

2 These had not yet at that time received the deuylyshe kyngedome of pestilent
vsurpacyon over the sowles of men. For though in Iohans days arose certain
Antichrists / as Hebion / Cerinthus / Diotrephes / Carpocras / and so the like
/ yet were they nothing to these.

3 But now in deed they have received the same self auctoryte and power with
the Beast / that he took before of the Dragon / in manner of kings to rewle in
the hearts and consciences of men to his behoue.

4 For so much as their auctoryte is not of God like as is the auctorite of
kings / it is said here as kings / or as men counterfeatynge them / in
usurping a governance not frelye given them of God / but of the devil.

5 All at one hour received they this auctoryte with the Beast. And that (I
suppose) was in the general counsel of Laterane at Rome / gathered under the
title to recover Jerusalem again. Where as confession in the ear was
cruellye extorted of Christen people under pain of death and dampnacion by the
whole consent both of the princes / and bishops / at the former suggestio^ of
innocent the third / besides other wicked things. As to hear lattyn service
/ to go procession on Sondayes / to pray unto dead Saints / to worship Images
/ to bye Masses for the dead / to fast the fridayes / with purgatory / pardons
/ merytes / and fryres orders. In the said counsel became the Metropolytanes
as kings / (...) by the auctorite thereof appointed they that (...). Balyues /
and other (...) / as bishops Curates / and Pari^^he Prestes to have cure and
charge of so idle / and in the said ear confession to receive their accountes.

6 These counterfett kings are all of one deuyllishe mind / practyse / and
purpose against God and his* veryte.

7 And fullye they are fixed to give their whole power / their stodye / and
their stre^gthe unto the behoue of the Beast* Not according to Gods mind will
they rewle / but all after his will and pleasure / agreynge always unto him as
members to their head / to serve wickedness after wickedness in Babilo^. His
popisshe decrees will they seek / his deuylishe decretals will they follow /
his ceremonials will they observe / and nothing of the sacred scripturs. What
lerning so ever they have / what gifts of nature / fortune / or grace / all
must be to the maintenance of his fantastycall fopperyes. To him are they
sworn to do him homage / to obey his laws / to kiss his fete / and for his
gloryes sake to persceut^ the Gospel.

10 And in so doing they shall fygh^ with the lamb / which is Jesus Christ.
They shall impugn his truth when they think to do him service. For that
myschese they do to one of his / they do to his own person.

9 But be they never so dogged / yet shall the lamb overcome them in his
faithful members / yea / by pacyent sufferaunce only. The vyctorye (says
Sayn^ Johan) which ouercometh the world / is a sure Christen faith. Upon
their side fyghteth he which is most mighty and strong / yea the lord that
is valeaune in battle. And he shall first overcome them in this life with the
mighty breathe of his mouth / scatterynge them away as dust from the earth.
And after this shall his terryble judgment for ever condemn them.

10 For he is by the auctoryte given him of his father / the lord of all
lords and by his own eternal Godhede the King of all kings / having all
power in heaven and in earth. He is constyt^^te judge of the quycke and the
dead / having alone the everlasting Empire with his father and the holy
ghost / and of his kingedome shall never be an end*

11 By his permyssion does all kings regne / he has their hertes in his hand
and judges their thoughts. Both may he give them his sprete / and also take
yt from them / and of his enemies he shall make his forestole. He is the same
sto^ne after Danyell that without any ha^^des was cut out of the mount /
which breaks the Iro^ / the copper / the earth / the silver / and the gold
in pieces. By whom are meant the universal kyngedomes of this world.

12 Of this his vyctorye are all they pa^^tyners with him / which are upon his
sy^de by faith. Most specyallye those tru^ servants of his / which after
they ar^ called by grace and chosen by faith / persevere still constaunt /
fervent / fayth^full / and sure in his veryte to the latte^ end of their lives.

13 Not only the lamb therefore shall o^uercome the Beast / but they also afte^
the doctrine of Paul that are called and chosen in him / not falling from his
tr^^che for any temptacyo^ or grefe / but sta^^dinge fast by yt unto the very
death. For those that the lord has prefixed before / he has called /
justified / and allowed. These auaunceth not themselves with the proud / but
mekelye they submit their crowns / referrynge all vyctorye to the lamb / as
men that could have done nothing in that behalf with out him.

The Text.
1 And he said unto me. 2. The waters which thu saw it / where the whore
sits. 3. are people / and folk / and nacyons / and tu^ges. 4. Ad the te^
horns / which thu saw upon the beast. 5. are they which shall hate the whore
6. and shall make her desolate / and naked. 7. and shall eat her flesh 8. and
burn her with fire 9. For God has put in their hearts / to f^lfyll his
will. 10. and to do with one consent. 11. for to give her kingdom unto the
beast 12. until the words of God be fulfilled. 13. And the woman which thu
saw / is the great city. 14. which reygneth over the Kings of the earth.

The Paraphrase.
1 And after this long communicacyo^ (says saint Johan) the aforeseyd Angel
said thus unto me / to make up his tale with.

2 The wauerynge waters which thu saw here now of late in mysterye / where
as the Babylonyshe whore sits upon the rose colored Beast / are in
sygnyficacyon all manner of peples of the carnal nacyons / and the
superstycyouse folk of many sondrye tongues.

3 Not only in one place of the world rewleth this wanton relygyon of
Antichrist / but in every land / in every domynion / in every cumpanye /
among all occupacyons and languages. The folyshe multitude every where /
being blinded by their subtyle sorceryes / and neither having faith nor yet
the fear of God before their eyes / as a ragynge flood (the banks broken
down) ^o^^eth headlynges into all blasphemy and deuyllyshnesse.

4 More over the before named.x. horns (says the Angel) which thu by the will
of God beholdest here in sprete / upon the said Beast of destruccyon / are
those very persons which also shall hate the whore. Her abhominacyons ones
known by the Gospel preachinge / they shall abhor her laws / despise her
auctoryte / and contempne her customs. They shall defeat her of those lands
and possessions which now she unjustly ho^deth.

5 They that before were her fryndes shall than be her mortal enemies /
denyenge her both tribute / obedyence / and service / so leaving her without
all comfort. Not only are these the temporal governors / as the king of
England / the king of Denmark / the Duke of saron / the Landgraue of hesse /
and other Princes of Germanye / with soche other as will here after follow the
same pryncyples / but also the Metropolytanes and Bishops / the Doctors and
Prelates. As are all redye Thomas Cra^mere the arche Bishop of Cau^terburye /
Hermannus de weda the archebyshopp of Coleyne / Godryck the Bishop of Holy /
Barlowe the Bishop of Saint David's / Bird the Bishop of Chestre / Thu^^leby
bishop of Westmynstre / (...) tymer and Nicolas Sharton of late years Bishops
of Worcester and Salysburye / with soche other like as will here after follow
their trade. Though they were before the horns of the Beast for defense of the
whore / yet are they now fallen from him / and more shall every day to make
her desolate of honor and naked of rentes and possessions.

6 So shall they chase that Babylonyshe harlot Rome with their preachers / that
neither shall they leave her color nor yet bewtye. Considre what Ioha^
Reuclin / Martyne Luther / Erasmus / Occolampadius / ^winglius / Pomeran /
Buter / Capito / Melanchton / Grineus / Calninus / Brencyus / Frances La^bert /
Bullinger / and soche other has done against her alredye. Like wise here in
England / Bylneye / Cyndale / Frith / Barnes / Cromwell / Couerdale / Turner /
George Joy / Rose / Rydleye / Ward / Beco^ / and other else / leaving her
neither Rellyques nor Rodes / Sects nor Shrynes / Abbeyes nor Pryoryes / many
more coming after them of the same sort. These shall make her so desolate
that no ma^ne shall in process of time regard her. They shall leave her so
naked / that all the world shall abhor her that shall lo^^ upon her. Yea /
in the conclusyon they (...) her flesh.

7 Besides the taking away of her carnal profyghtes and pleasurs / they
shall confound her fl^shelye understanding of the scripturs / and utterly
consume the superfluouse obseruacyons of her whoryshe c^remonyes.

8 Finallye with fire shall they burn her / in brynginge unto naught all her
abominable rewles / customs / and kinds of Idolatrye. All these ones plucked
away by the euydent word of God / no longar shall this harlot apere. For no
lo^gar contynueth the whore / than the who redome is in price. Take away the
rytes and Ceremonies / the Jewels and ornaments / the Images and lyghtes / the
lordeshyppes and fatherhodes / the aulters and Masses / with the Bishops and
Prestes / and what is their holy whor^she church any more? Not only is this
flesh eating and burning declared now adays in outward experymentes / as
in the rebellyouse Monks and Prestes of England / and in the^ that arose
there in the North / specyallye in fryre forest and Margare^^ Chenye / which
were for their church consumed / like as were Baals chaplaynes at the broke of
Cyson by Helyas / but also misticallye in that is spoken of here before.

9 For God has (says the Angel) all blindness secluded / put it into the
hearts of those and soche other Godly men by the infusyon of his sprete / to
fulfill his decreed will so pleasure in this behalf / as utterly to destroy
the Popyshe relygyon or filthy abhominacyons of Antichrist.

10 He has given yt them more over to do these things to his glory / through
the agreement of faith that they have in the unity of his Godly truth / to
the abolyshment of all Sects / false Prophets / and coniurers of Egypt.

11 Fynallye by his grace he has moved them / through knowledge of his word to
render up her blasphemouse kyngedome (whom sumtyme of ignorance they usurped)
unto the malygnaunt Beast again / as the horns of his pestyle^t heads. After
this sort ded good Latimer and Shaxton give over their Bysshop-ryckes / and so
has diverse other Godly men their promocyons and liuinges / as many more
yet here after will do.

12 For as they have begone so shall they continue in demynyshynge the
abhomynacyo^s of this whoryshe church / till the words and promyses of God by
his Apostles and Prophets / which can never fail / be whollye fulfilled in
effect / and till his last judgment do fynyshe all. But thus do not all they
which have done of the yoke of the Popes obedyence or blotted out his name. For
the greatter nombre of them retayneth still the blasphemouse obseruacyons and
Ceremonies of his Romyshe relygyon / some making new laws of death for the
establyshment of the same / as is in England the act of the.vi. Artycles with
diverse other more. And for this remains here still the Beast as receyuynge
the rendered kyngedome of the whore. In whom is also comprehended the wicked
re^naunt that shall work the last myschefe / whom the lord shall end with
his said judgment. This Beast is not without his lyuelye Image still workynge
the same feats that himself wrought before / though his head be greuouslye
wounded in diverse quarters of the world. Neither is he without craftye.
Phesycyanes / to mynystre life to the same. Who ever forswore the Pope more
ernestlye / tha^ ded Stokyslaye and Sampson / Gardyne^ and Tunstall / wylson
and fryre wattes / with soche other holy prelates? Yet labor they tothe and
nail to have Babylon still Babylon / Sodom Sodom / and Egypt Egypt. But
maruele not of the ordinance of the lord / which all at one time provided
Moses to gyde his people and yet hardened Pharao against them which sent his
son Jesus Christ to save them / and yet suffered the Prestes to murder him /
co^sideringe he is that potter which makes both the vessels of honor and
dishonor.

13 Breuelye to conclude the whole of this matter (says the Angel) the
gorgyouse aparcled woman / or glytteringe church of a^tichrist / which thu
saw here of late in misterye / is also in resemblaunce the great cite
Babylon / the mother of all the spiritual abhominacyons and Idolatryes done
upon the earth. For like as from Syon has the law comme^ forth and the word
of God from Jerusalem / so has yssewed forth from this Babylonyshe Rome soche
a false Relygyon into Emprours / princes / and peples / as with fylthyr
superstycyons has poisoned all the world.

14 For a kyngedom she has over the kings or noble governors of the earth /
a false power / a usurped auctoryte / and a seat of very pestylence. Alas for
pytye that so worthy potentates should be in subieccyon to so slynkynge an
whore / to so vile an harlott / being so the servants of sin and captyue
slaves to all wickedness / from the which the lord ones deliver them. Amen.
