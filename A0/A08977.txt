Robin and Kate: or,
A bad husband converted by a good wife, in a dialogue between Robin and Kate.

To the tune of Blew Cap.


Far in the North Country (as I have heard tell)
there lines a blithe couple cau'd Robbin and Kate:
This Robbin does love nappy liquor so well,
that he will be at th'Alehouse both early and late
The wife to her husband
in the morning does say,
I prithee sweet Robin
at home with me stay,
Thou wastest thy time,
and spendest thy chinke,
Turn back again Robin,
and ga not to drink
Man. I prithee sweet honey be patient and quiet,
I Am sure thou want nothing that's fit for thy state,
Thou lackst neither money, apparel, nor diet,
if any thou do, do but speak and thou'st ha'te:
Thou have all the good
that a wife can desire,
Tha'st servants to 'tend thee,
and I pay their hire:
Then for my good-fellowship
do not thou prate,
For I must and I will
have my humor sweet Kate.

Wife. It Is chiefly thy company that I do want,
besides, though we now have sufficient to live,
Yet if thou the Alehoule thus daily do haunt,
we may become fitter to take than to give:
Sweet husband consider
and take my advice,
Let not thy companions
thus lewdly entice
Thy heart from thy Kate,
but upon my words think,
Turn back again Robin,
and ga not to drink.

Out, out, hold thy twattle and do not thus preach,
I Will not be ruld by thee whateuer thou say,
Seek not by perswastons my mind to ouer-reach,
for I Will to the Alehouse as fast as I may*
If thither thou follow,
thou welcome shall be,
So thou will be quiet
and pleasant with me,
Stay here or ga with me,
it is both of a rate,
But I must, and I will
have my humor sweet Kate.

Wife. Waes me bonny Robin, that ere I was marrids,
unto sike a husband that seeks my undoing,
I would with my mother at home I had tarryde,
or thought upon this when thou first came a wooing*
I think in my conscience,
(and I have cause why,)
That thou love some other,
far better than I:
Thou hat'st to stay with me,
then what may I think,
Turn back again Robin
and ga not to drink.

Man. Nay now I find Kate whereabout thy shoe wrings,
by this I perceive that of me thou art jealous,
But I for my part never dream of sike things,
I seek not for wenches, but honest good fellows:
A pipe of Tobacco,
a Pot or a Iugg,
These are the sweet honies
that I kiss and hugg:
All wenching delights
are with me out of date,
But I must and I will
have my humor sweet Kate.

The second part
To the same tune.


Wife I Prithee my joy do not take at the worst
the words that I speak in the heat of affection,
No evil conceit in my bosom is nursed,
I de have thee be ruled by my loving direction:
It think thou art honest
to me in thy heart,
But company ill
may draw thee apart:
To wastefull expenses
thy mind do not link:
Turn back again Robin,
and ga not to drink.

Man. Good wife be persuaded, and let me alone,
forall thy vain prattle will prove but mere folly,
I tell thee my heart will be cold as a stone,
if I stay at home I shall be melancholy
I Will make my self merry
as long as I Have store
Tush Kate never think on it
wee'st never be poor:
Shall I stay at home
on thy fancy to wait,
No I must and I will
have my humor sweet Kate.

Wife. Why Robin when first thou did marry with me,
thou thoughtst thy self best when thou ^^idst with me lo^gest,
How comes the case thus to be altered with thee,
true love by much usage will grow to be strongest:
But now thou art weary
of my company,
And can not be merry,
I prithee Love why?
Thou give me occasion
strange matters to think,
Turn back again Robin,
and ga not to drinck.

Man. Oh who would be troubled thus with a fool,
I prithee sweetheart take one word for thy learning,
I scorn that my wife over me should bear rule:
why Kate, do I sp^nd any thing of thy earning?
I love thee as well
as I did the first day,
And yet when I list
I will go or I Will stay,
To be at command
of my wife, I do hate,
For I must and I will,
have my humor sweet Kate.

Wife Alas my dear Lui^ thou mistakest me much,
I do not command thee, that's not my intention,
For my humble duty unto thee is such,
that one word of anger to thee I Will not mention
Examine thy heart,
and thou shall understand
I give thee good counsel,
I do not command:
Then with due discretion,
upon my words think,
Turn back again Robin,
and ga not to drink.

Man. Ah now my sweet Kate I perceive very well,
thy words do proceed from a hearty affection,
Now all my delight in thy bosom* shall dwell,
I Will ever be orderd by thy direction
My former ill husbandry,
I will repent,
And in thy sweet company,
rest well content:
Strong Liquor no more,
shall impair my estate,
Now I Will stay at home
with my bonny sweet Kate.

M. P.
