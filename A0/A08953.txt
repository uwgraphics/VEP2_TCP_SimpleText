An Exact Description Of the manner how his Majesty and his Nobles went to the
Parliament, on Monday, the thirteenth day of April, 1640. to the comfortable
expectation of all Loyal Subjects.
To the tune of Triumph and Joy, etc.

COme the merriest of the nine,
And now unto my aid incline,
I need a little help of thine
For now I have intent
Unto the world to say and sing
The praises of our royal King,
Who now this present hopeful spring
Has called a Parliament.
This happy April will, I trust,
Give all five subjects reason just
Of joy to feel a pleasant gust,
To yield them hearts content:
For we may be assured of this,
If any thing has been amiss,
Our King and State will all redress
In this good Parliament.
The order how they rode that day
To you I will in brief display,
In the best manner that I may,
For new my mind is bent
To publish what my self did see,
That (...) (Loyal) hearts may be
Participants as well as we
In The joy oth' Parliament.
The Messengers (...)
In their rich coats, on horses tall,
Rode foremost as their places fall,
And next in order went
Some Gentlement of quality,
That serve the King for annual fee,
Thus every man in his degree
Rode to the Parliament.
Heralds in rich coats did ride,
Whose proper office was to guide,
And range the show on every side
By place or by descent:
The Trumpets made a cheerful sound,
Thus joy did every where abound,
Heaven bless King Charles, the word went round,
And guide the Parliament.
The Masters of the Chancery
The next present themselves to the eye,
The Council of his Majesty,
All learned and eloquent:
Next came the Judges gr^ve in sight,
In scarlet furred with Miniver white,
Thus every one in order right
Rode to the Parliament.
The Master of the R^ls i place
Rode next along with gen^^e pace,
A fable Uelvet gown tha space
He wore for ornament:
The sons of our Nobility
Each one according to's degree,
In rich apparel brave to se,
Did ride to the Parliament.
The Barons of the Kingdom all,
In Parliament (robes as we them call)
Each one just as his place did fall,
In noble order went
By the antiquity of blood;
The ^^^hops next made places good,
Each one in's Scarlet gown and hood,
Rode to the Parliament.
The Uiscounts next inorder past
As due decorum did forecast,
Clad every one, both first and last,
In fit acoutrement:
Our Princely Earls in rich attire,
Did cause spectators to admire
The peoples hearts were set on fire
For joy oth' Parliament.
The noble Marquess Winchester,
Whose virtue does on him confer
Such excellency which all prefer
Most high and eminent,
Did ride alone with gallant grace,
As was indeed his proper place,
Thus all rode on with stately pace
Unto the Parliament.
Earl Marshall with a Scepter of gold,
The Lord high Chamberlain brave and bold,
His staff of office then did hold,
And thus in State they went:
Lord Treasurer, Lord Privy Seal brave,
Lord Keeper, and the Archbishop grave,
These next the Prince their places have
In The Court of Parliament.
Then Princely Charles (that hopeful Lad)
Whose sight made all true subjects glad,
Did ride (as he good reason had)
In place most eminent:
(...) the stream of honor bring
(...) all to the head Spring,
(...) Prince, fromth Prince ^oth King
In this high Parliament.
The next and last in honors seat
Was he who made the show complete,
Our gracious King, our Charles the Great,
Our joys sweet complement,
Did ride in state to open sight,
The royal band of Pensioners wait
About him with guilt Polaxes bright
Unto the Parliament.
The Master of the horse did lead
(On horseback) in his hand, a Steed,
A horse of State it is called indeed:
And last behind him went
The Noble Captain, and the Guard,
All in rich coats (for this prepared)
Against this day no cost was spared
To grace the Parliament.
Besides all this which has been told
(To speak the same I dare be bold)
Though corporal eyes could not behold,
A Legion did present
Celestial service to attend
King Charles, and him from harm defend,
The King of Kings did's Angels send
TO assist our Parliament.
FINIS.
