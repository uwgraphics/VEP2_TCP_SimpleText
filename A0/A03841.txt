THE PROMINE.
On the xij. day at five houris before none, 1500. seventy nine in June.

GOLDIN Titan with burning bemis bricht
Be kindly course, and reuolutioun
Appeirandlie, to the Astrologues sicht
Was in the first degree of Cancer wone
Or neir hand by in his Ecliptyk rone
Against the force quhilk daily had him rent
Be the first Mobillis, weltering violent.
Sa in his Solstice glemand gloriously
Throw nature of his proper motioun
That Pompous Planeit placit properly
In that North Sign, of richt ascensioun
Quhair Iuppiter hes exaltatioun
Did with his bemis on bankis and brayis beit
The fruits to foster with his hailsum heit.
And flowand Phaebe, Lady of the seyis
Not retrograd, reuoluing in hirring
Beheld the west, with fixit face and eyis
In Joyful June, quhen the xij. day did spring
Befoir the furthcome of that cumlie King:
Quhilk as the Sone out of the clouds gray
Fra Snawdoun Castle did descend that day.
With manlike manner is, maikles to behald
With Princely port, and visage glorious
With gentill gesture, wordis wise and called
In taikning of the may victorious
Richt gaylie garnist with giftis gracious
Quhais heavenly hauingis stonischit the Air
As esterward I purpois to declair.
At his first furthcome on the G^wane hillis
To write how every circumstance befell,
Quhat heir began of Hagbutis, bowis and Billis
Quhat din of daggis, with clink of money bell
At Falcounis fair, war tedious to tell
For to be schort, I schaw not how the steidis
On bridillis bait, quhil famie mouthis bleidis

Of Poetry, and pairt of Eloquence
To schaw the manner, I esteem it meit
How every thing maid haill obedience
Unto his Royal hie Magnificence
Reiosit swa, with suddand semelie sicht
Of that leidsterne, and luifsum lamp of licht.
His Princely presence superexcellent
As lemand Lantern may delectabill
Did every leuing creature content
And to thingis senceles semit amiabill.
Quhais Celsitude was sa acceptabill
That in their kind Ilk thing did observance
His heich honor and worschip to auance.
I mean not only thingis Inferiall
That subject at unto corruptioun,
Bot also celest^ and Superiall
Quhais substance is but alteratioun
As fair Phoebus, or vtherwayis the Sone
Quhilk is composit of na Element,
That day brak up in his bricht birneist Tent.
And schew his radious visage rubicound
Quhilk all the day lay hid unto the howr
That his grace Ischit forth upon the ground:
Thairefter did on eirth his presence power
Excluding than all signs of the schowr
Sa glaid he was to se his gudlie grace,
And (...) fast the phi^^ome of his face.
Sine in the praises of that Prince preclair,
Spread forth his Purpour springis aureat
Into sic sort to purify the Air
Quhill all the skyis skaillit violat
The Hemispheir become Illuminat
Upon the eirth be heavenly Influence
Distelland dewis on vapouris sweit as sense.
The ground ouirgiltand all with goldin glemis
Quhill throw his michtie operatiounis
Forth of fresche fludes bet with burial bemis
Raise sappie subtle exhalatiounis,
Quhais potent pithie Inspiratiounis
Makis treis, fruits, and flouris for to spreid,
Nicelie enamaling money mirthfull meid.
Tha^ fair dame Flora glaiding gardings gay
Syilit with schaddow of the blumand bewis
Her minglit Mantill meiklie display

With flouris of ane hundredth heavenly hewis
Quhair besilie the bummand honey Beis

Reuest the Rosis, and the Lilleis quhite,
Into dulce humouris herbis did abound
Bathing the bony Daseis of delight:
With ane sweit liquour on the leiffis lit
Comforting all the fragrant freklit flouris
That spreidis in Maij throw hailsum balmis
Obedientlie begouth than to vnfald
The beiraris bricht their flouris to his eis
Quhen they his potent presence did behald

With brawland bowkis bendand ouir the brais
The flingand Fownis followand dune dais
Sa curage causit beistis make besines
His Majesty mui^and to merines.
Bot to behald it was ane perfect Joy
And as ane eirdlie plesand Paradise:
To heu and se their at the kingis conuoy
The Merle and Maweis, changeing notis nice
The kiddis skippand, with Raise throw the rice
Quhair birdis blyithlie on the branches sang
With sie ane reird, quhill all the Rokkis rang.
Swa schortlie throw sit heavenly harmoneis
Become richt coy, heiring the fowlis sing
Both Eolus, and Neptune God of seis,
Behalding fast the cumming of that King
Quhilk was sa welcum unto every thing.
Quhat misteris mair, the Goldspinkis was sa glaid

And pynit pure men from all panis relaxt

For vicious folk, with filthy faultis defylit
Into his Court sall have na praise nor place.
And gredie godles men sall be begylit
Gif they presume for to obtene his grace.
All feneit flatteraris sall an fle his face
And as the snaw meltis from the Sone away
Sa from his sicht the wickit sall decay.
Quhairfoir now Scotland sing with ane accord
Both greit and small, of Ilk stait and degree
Perpetual praise, and thankis to the Lord
That he ow geuin sa good ane King as he.

Both worschip, wealth, and weilfair euermoir,
And of his fois the vaileand victory
With heavenly, eirthlie, (...) felicity:
And that in him (God) be ay glorifeit
Luifit, honored, feird, and ever sanctifeit.
