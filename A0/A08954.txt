A Fair Portion for a Fair Maid: OR,
The thriftie Maid of Worstersheere,
Who lives at London for a Mark a year;
This Mark was her old Mothers gift,
She teaches all Mayds how to shift.
To the tune of, Gramercy penny,


NOw all my Friends are dead and gone,
alas what shall betide me,
For I poor maid am left alone
without a house to hide me:
Yet still I Will be of merry cheer,
and have kind welcome every where
Though I have but a Mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
I scorn to think of poverty,
or wanting food or clothing,
I Will be maintained gallantly,
and all my life-want nothing;
A frolic mind I Will always bear,
my poverty shall not appear,
Though I have but a mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
Though I am but a silly Wench
of country education,
Yet I am wooed by Dutch and French,
and almost every nation:
Both Spaniards and Italians swear
that with their hearts they love me dear,
Yet I have but a Mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
The Welsh the Irish and the Scot,
since I came to the City,
In love to me are wondrous hot,
they tell me I am pretty:
Therefore to live I will not fear,
for I am sought with many a tear,
Yet I have but a Mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
This London is a gallant place
to raise a Lasses fortune;
For I that came of simple race,
brave Roarers do importune:
I little thought in Wostersheere
to find such high preferment here,
For I have but a Mark a year,
and that my mother gave me.
One gives to me perfumed Gloves,
the best that he can buy me,
Live where I will I have the loves
of all that do live nigh me:
If any new toys I will wear,
I have them cost they ne'rs so dear,
And this is for a mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
My fashions with the Moon I change,
as though I were a Lady*
All quaint conceits, both new and strange,
I Will have as soon as may be;
Your courtly Ladies I can feere,
In clothes but few to me come near,
Yet I have but a Mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
The second Part
To the same Tune.


FRench gowns with sleeves like pudding-bags
I have at my requesting:
Now I forget my country rags,
and scorn such plain inuesting:
My old acquaintance I casheere,
and of my kin I hate to hear,
Though I have but a mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
My Petty-coats of Scarlet brave,
of Velvet, silk and Sattine:
Some students often my love do crave,
that speak both Greek and Latin,
The Soldiers for me domineere,
and put the rest into great fear,
All this is for a mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
The Precisian sincerely woes,
and does protest he loves me,
Ho tires me out with Ies and noes,
and to impatience moves me:
Although an oath he will not swear,
to lie at no time he does fear,
All this is for a Mark a year,
And that my mother gave me
My Coach drawn with four Flanders mares
each day attends my pleasure,
The Watermen will leave their fares
to wait upon my leisure:
Two Lackies labor every where,
and at my word run far and near,
Though I have but a mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
In The pleasant'st place the Suburbs yields,
my lodging is prepared:
I can walk forth into the fields,
where beauties often are aired;
When Gentlemen do spy me there,
some complements I Am sure to hear,
Though I have but a mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
Now if my friends were living still,
I would them all abandon,
Though I confess they loved me well,
yet I so like of London,
That farewell Dad and Mammy dear,
and all my friends in Worstershire:
I live well with a Mark a year,
Which my old mother gave me.
I would my sister Sue at home,
knew how I live in fashion,
That she might up to London come
to learn this occupation:
For I live like a Lady here,
I wear good clothes and eat good cheer
Yet I have but a Mark a year,
And that my mother gave me.
Now blessed be that happy day
that I came to the City:
And for the Carrier will I pray,
before I end my Ditty.
You Maidens that this Ditty hear,
though means be short, yet never fear,
For I live with a Mark a year,
Which my old mother gave me.
