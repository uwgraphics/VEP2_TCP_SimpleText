The pater noster spoken of ye Sinner: God answering him at every peticyon.

The pr^ nr^ spoken of the sinner.
The sinner. O Our father which art in heaven / what a great space is between
the and us? How therefore shall we thy children here on earth / banysshed and
exiled from the in this vale of mysery and wretchedness / come home to the
into our natural country?


God. The child honors his father / and the servant his master. If I be
your father / where is mine honor? If I be your lord / where is my fear?
Malachias.i. For my name through you and by your means is blaspemed / rayled
upon / and evil spoken of. Esaias.lii.


The sinner. Helas o father that is truth / we knowledge our sin and trespace
/ nevertheless / yet be thou a merciful father / and dele not with us
accordige to our deservings / neither judge us by the rygorousnesse of thy law
/ but give us grace that we may so live / that thy holy name may be hallowed
and sancttfyed in us.

And keep our hertes that we neither do nor speak / no / that we not ones
think our purpose any thing / but that which is to thine honor and praise /
and above al things make thy name and honor to be sought of us / and not our
own name and vain glory. and of thy mighty power bring to pass in us / that
we may love and fear the / as a son his father.


God. How can mine honor and name be hallowed among you / when your hertes and
thoughts are always enclyned to evil / and ye in bondage and captiuyte under
sin: moreover seeing that no man can sing my laud and praise in a strange
country. Psalm. cxxxvi.


The sinner. O father that is truth / we feel our members / ye / and also the
very hertes of us prone and ready to sin / and that the world / the flesh /
and the devil / rule in us / and expel the dew honor of thine holy name.
Wherefore we beseech the most merciful father / for ye love that thou have
unto thy son Christ help us out of this miserable bondage / and let thy
kingdom come to drive out the sin / to lose the bonds of Satan / to tame
the flessh / to make us rightuouse and parfeyte / and to cleue unto the / that
thou only maiste raygne in us / and that we may be thy kingdom and possessyon
/ and the obey with all our power and strength / both within and without.


God. Whom I help / them I distroye. And whom I make living / safe / rich /
and good / them I kill / condemn / and cast them away / make them beggars /
and bring them to naught. But so to be cured of me ye will not suffer. Psalmo.
lxxvii. How than shall I hele you / ye / and what can I do more? Esaias.v.


The sinner. That is to us great sorrow and grefe / that we can neither
understand nor suffer thy holsom hand / wherefore help dear father / open our
eyes / and work patience in us / that we may understand thy holesom hand and
also pacie^tly suffer thy godly will to be fulfilled in us.

Furthermore / though thy most wholesome cure be never so paynfull unto us / yet
go forward therewith / punisshe / beat / cut / burn / distroy / bri^ge to
naught dampne / cast down unto hell / and do what so ever thou will that thy
will only may be fulfilled and not ours. Forbydde dear father / and in no wise
suffer us to follow our own good thoughts and imagynations / neither to
prosecute our own will / meaning / and purpose. For thy will and ours ar
clean contrary one to the other / thine only good / though it otherwise appear
unto our blind reason and our evil / though our blindness se it not.


God. I am well served and delte with all / that men love me with their lyppes
/ and their hertes are far fro me / and when I take them in hand to make
them better and to amend them / than ro^ne they backwarde / and in the mids
of their cure / while their health is a workyng / they withdraw them selves fro
me: as thou redest. Psalm. lxxvii.

Conuersi su^t in die belli. They are turned back in the day of battle.
That is to say / they which began well / and committed them selves unto me /
that I should take them in hand / and cure them / are gone back fro me in
time of temptation / and killing of the flesh / and are returned to sin
and unto dishonourynge of me again.


The sinner. O father it is true / no man can be strong in his own strength /
in the second chapyter of the first of the Kings. ye / and who is able to
suffer and a bide before thine hand / if thou thy self strength and conforte
us not: wherefore most merciful father take us unto thy cure / fulfill thy will
in us / that we may be thy kingdom and inherytau^ce unto thy laud and
praysynge. Also dear father / strength and confort us in such business with thy
holy word. Give us our daily bred / grave and prynte thy dear son Jesus in
our hertes / that we strengthed through him may cherefully and gladly suffer
and endure the distroyenge and killing of our will / and the fulfyllynge of
thy will / ye / and shede out thy grace upon all christente / and send learned
prestes and prechers to tech us thy son Jesus purely / and to feed us with
the word of thy holy gospel / and not with the dregs and chafe of fables
and men's doctrine.


God. It is not good to cast perles before swyne / neither to give holy things
/ and the childrens bred unto the dogs and hou^des. ye sin contynually with
out ceassyng / and though I let my word be preached among you never so much /
yet ye follow not neither obey / but dispyse it.


The sinner. O father have mercy on us / and deny us not that breed of love /
it greueth us fore / even at the very heart rotes of us / that we can not
satisfye thy word and follow it. we desire the there to have pacyence with us
thy poor and wretched children and to forgive us our trespace and gyle / and
judge us not after thy law / for no man is rightuouse in thy presence. Look on
thy promyses / we forgive our trespacers / and that with all our hertes / and
unto such have thou promised forgyuenes / not that we through such
forgyuenesse ar worthy of thy forgyuenesse / but that thou art true / and of
thy grace and mercy have promised forgyuenes unto all them that forgive their
neighbors / in this thy promise therefore is all our hope and trust.


God I forgive you often / and loose you often / and ye never abide steadfast /
children of little faith are ye / ye can not watch and endure with me a little
while / but attones fall again into te^ptatio^. Mathe. in the.xxvi. chapter.


The sinner. Weak are we o father / and feeble / and the temptacyon great and
manyfolde in the flessh and in the world. Keep us father with thy mighty
power / and let us not fall in to temptatyon and sin again: but give us
grace that we may abide sta^dynge / and fight manfully unto the end / for
without thy grace we can do nothing.


God. I am rightuous / and right is my judgment / and therefore sin may not
be unpunished / ye / and ye must suffer evil and affliction / and as touching
that ye have te^ptatyon thereby / that is your sins fault only / which
compels me thereunto / to kill it and to heal you. For sin can with none
other medycyne be drawn out of you / but through aduersyte and suffrynge of
evil.


The sinner. For as much than as aduersyte / trybulatio^ / afflyction / and
evil / which fight against sin give us temptacyon / deliver us out of
them / fynisshe thy cure / and make us through hole / that we losed from sin
and evil / may be unto the a kingdom / to laud / to praise / and to
sanctify the. Amen

^ And seeing thou have taught us thus to pray / and have promised also to
here us / we hope and are sure that thou wylt graciously and mercyfully grant
us our peticions for thy verites sake / and to the honourynge of thy truth.
Amen,

^ Finally some man will say happily: what and if I can not believe that my
prayer is herd. I answer. Than do as the father of the possessed did in
the.ix. of Mark / wha^ Christ said unto him. If thou could believe / all
things are possible unto him that believes. The father answered: I believe
lord help mine unbelief. That is to say: Hele mine unbelief / and give me
perfyte belefe / and strength the weakness of my faith / and increase it.


AMEN
