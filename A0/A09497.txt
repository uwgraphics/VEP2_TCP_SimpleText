Here begins a right profitable treatise co^pendiously drawn out of many
and diverse wrytynges of holy men / to dyspose men to be virtuously occupied in
their minds and prayers. And declared the Pater noster. Aue. and Credo. in our
mother tongue with many other devout prayers in like wise medefull to religyous
people as to the lay people with many other most holsomest Instruccyons / as
here after it shall follow.

The famous doctor Johan gerson Chau^celer of Paris / taking his ground of
holy scripture. and according with all other doctors says thus.

OVre most merciful fad lord god knowing our freelte and redynes to all
sy^nes. is ever ready during this wretched and mortal life / by many and diverse
ways to forgive us our trespace / and to grant and give us his grace / if so
be that truly we ordeyne unto him these treuthes following said and done with
all our heart. The first / thou shall say. Blessed lord I knowleche yt I have
sinned against thy goodness thus and thus Rehersynge thy sins. And I am
dyspleaseth therewith by reason of the which I do penance and will do. For I
know well that I have grieved the and broken thy commandments. In the which
thou only ought to be worshypped. The second say this treuthe. Good lord I
have good purpose and desire with thyn help to be right ware herafter that I
fall not in to sin / and I entende to flee the occasions after ye possibilyte
of my power. The third is this. Mercyful lord I have a good will to make an
hole confession of all my sins when place and time convenient may be had
acordynge to thy commandment and all holy church. These three treuthes who
soever says with his heart vnfaynyngly in what place yt ever it be / he may be
sure yt he is in ye state of health and grace and he shall have ever lasting life
though he had done all the sins of the world. And if he decessed without any
other confession for lack of a priest. as slepyng sodayn death he should be
save suffrynge before hard pain of purgatory / wherefore it is a good counsel yt
every christian man ones or twyes a day erly or late / or else at lest on holy
days examyne his conscience and remember if he may with al his heart vnfayny^gly
say these three treuthes / and if he do he may be sure yt he is in ye state of
grace. And if he may not. but is in will to sin again and to have his
delectacion with deed / and will not flee the occasyons of mortal sins and so
drowned will not arise. as usurers. falls marchau^ or yt desyren vengeance with
such other such may be certain yt the pope may not assoyle^ (...). Not for
thy holsom counsel is yt such pray and give alms and do other good deeds
after their power ye god the rather may lyghten their hertes. and the sooner
torn them to goodness. Amen.

This Pater noster / taught our lord his dyscyples / and all people by his
gospel.
^Ader our that art in heuens / hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come to ye.
Thy will be do as in heaven so in earth. Our each daily bread give us to day.
And forgive us our dettes right as we forgive to our dettours. And led us not
in to temptacyon. But deliver us from evil Amen / that is to say. So be it.

This is the Aue maria / that Gabryell said salutynge our blessed lady / and it
is the gospel.
HEyll Mary full of grace / the lord is with the / blessed be thou among
wymen / and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Ihesus. Amen.

These ben the artycles of our Creed / and our believe / that who is baptized
and trusts in hem shall be saved.
I Believe in god fad almighty shaper of heaven and earth. And in Ihesu christ
his oonly sone our lord / the which is conceived of the holy ghost / borne of
Mary the maid / suffered pain and passion vnd Ponce Pylate. Crucefyed / deed /
and buried / he lyghted down to helles. The.iij. day he arose from death to
live. He styed up in to heuens. He sytteth at the right side of god the fad
almighty From thens he is to come to deem both quycke and deed. I trow in ye
holy ghost / holy church universal / coming of saints / forgyuenes of
sins again rysynge of flesh / and everlasting life. Amen.

HOpe is trust by the mercy of god to be saved. And it stands in the grace
of our lord and our good works. Charity is ye end and the perfeccion of all
the commandments of god / and it stands in the love of god above all
things / and thy neighbor as thy self

These.vij. things following should we have ever in our mind.
THe sins yt we daily do. The short time that we shall abide here. The
uncertain of the day of our death. The unstableness and fraylte of us. The
strayte and ferefull Judgment of god. The bitter and unspeakable pains ordained
for sins. The everlasting loss of eternal glory.

Here follows a short remembrance for confession to al people / and in
especyal to al religious folk.
SEldom shall you find time in all the year in which you shall not have cause
to shryue the of some of these following / that is to wete of hasty or
neclygence saying ye service of god / or of lesynge of time / or else of vain
thougt or of undue reverence to god or to our lady or his saint or to ye other
yt ben thy souerayns. Or in forgetynge god and his daily benefayt. and not
thankyng hy^ for his creacion and his redempco^n. and yt he gat the yt mind to
dyspose the better than other ben with such other. And also not thanking hy^
for thy daily sustenaunce / clothing and health of thy body and for remissyon
of thy sins / for thyn enherytau^ce of heaven with other Innumerable. Also
remember thy wode words or noysom / or else falls Iugementes in thy mind / or
falls suspyco^n. Al^^ of any mouynge to wrath or to vain heaviness or vain
gladness. ^lso search in thy mind if you have well spended ye day and night
without sin / as if you have prayed or read to little with such other. Also
if you have past thy bounds in words or in etynge or drinking / slepynge or
laughing with such other. Also remember how you haste kept the maundementes
of thy sovereign / chastyte / pouerte / silence in places and hours according
as you art called for to do. Also if any person in word sign or deed you haste
offended and given any cause or occasyon of greuau^ce. Remember also if you have
ouerskypped in the service of god any words / verses / or any Inclynacyons and
such other. And of the wauerynge of thy mind / thyn eyes / and other
unmannerly behauyour of all thy body. Also of thy dishonest and noysom thoughts
/ that you should myghtly resyst not taryenge with them by thy will. Search also
if you have grutched for mete or drink or other necessaryes for because they
were not give to the after thy pleasyr. Look also if you have ^ynned in much
taking of mete and drink / or any other necessaryes more than need required
etc.

Saint Bernarde to a new begynner in relygyon.
IF you entende to please god and would obtain grace to fulfill the same two
things ben to the necessary. First thou must withdraw thy mind from all
transytory and erthely things as who say y^ carest as little for them as
there were none such things. The second is y^ you give thyself to god / that
you say nor do any thing / but that only that y^ verily byleuest should please
god And in this wise following you may get grace for the first. In all
things count thyself vile and simple / and as nothing in regard of virtue /
and believe all other to be good and better than thyself / and so shall thou
most please god. What soever you here or see of any relygyous pe^sone or of any
other good pe^sones / think always that all is done and said for good intent
though they seem ye contrary / for often man by suspycyon is begyled. Dysplease
no creature / and utter no langage to laud of thyself / though it were to thyn
^ost famylyer and be loved fellow / study ever more to keep more preuy thy
virtue than thy vice / sp^ke never evil of any man or woman though i^ be never
^o true / and ^pen it not without it be in conf^ssyon / and yt when you can not
else show clearly thyn own con^essyon. Be more glad to give thyn eere when
any man is praised / than when any pe^sone is dyspraysed / When you spekest have
few words / true / and ladde and ever of god / if any worldely person speak
with y^ and purpose or utter vain words / as soon as you may brebe out of
such comunyca^o^n and talking and talk of god and of his virtues / or else
depart and give yt to some goodly and goostly occupa^o^n. What soever befall
the or any other of thy friends give no charge of it / if it be prosperyte
rejoice not there of / if it be trouble or aduersyte be not sorry for it. But
take or acompte all such things as naught and ever praise and thank god /
give charge as much as you may to ye well and prosperyte of thy soul flee
places of much speech as much as you can. For it is much bet^ one to keep
his tongue than to speak. After complyn speak no word till the mass be done the
next day following without a great cause require. When you see any thing yt
dyspleaseth the / see if the fault be in thyself and than have compassyon / if
it be not / think that it may be and so let all things be to the as it were
in a glass to see thyself. Grutche not against any person without thou see
that you may profit what soever cause you have. Afferme neither deny nothing
ouerthwartly / but let thy nay or ye or thy doubt be powdered ever with salt /
that is to say / let hem be spokan with discrecion and pacyence. Be evermore
ware of mocking and of scornynge. If you be light of contenau^ce see it be but
selde / have thy comunicacion but with few persons and shortly behave thyself
so in all thy saying that you speak not rather in a doubt than men should take
auctoryte or ground of thy saying. The second you may obtain in this wise.
Give thyself with great devotion to pray and let thyn heart agree with yt you
say both day and night. Remember also dylygentely that thou ymagyne the
state of them / in whose remembrance you make thy prayer. These three have
always in thy mind / what you were / what you art / and what you shall be. By
reason of thy body / you were foul slyme of the earth / and now thy body is the
house of fylte and derte / and herafter it shall be worms mete. Also ymagyne ye
pains of them yt ben in hell and how that pain shall never have end / and
how they suffer all these pains for a little delectaco^n and pleasyr in sin.
Also ymagyne the Joy of paradyse / and how that shall never be fynysshed and
how shortly and soon it may be gotten. Than think what sorrow and waylynge may
be to them yt for so little a thing here have lost so great Joy contynuell.
And when you have any thing that does dysplease the / or else you dredest to
have it / think and if you were in hell you sholdest have that / and all that
you would not have / and so shall you suffer all thing ^or crystus sake and
his love. Also when you have any thing that pleases the / or else that you
desyrest to have / think and if thou were in paradyse you sholdest have it and
all other things that thou would desire. Also when there falls any fest of
any saint think on hy^ what pain he suffered here for gods sake and how
short his pains was. Than thyn be how great Joy he has in heaven for that
which is everlasting. And so thou may think that the trybulacion or
tourmentynge o^ the good men is soon gone. And in like wise the Joy of evil
men fades anon. but good men with their trybulacyon here geteth eternal
glory. And evil men with their ouermoche Joy here geteth everlasting pain.
Furthermore when you art accombred with sloth and lackest deuoco^n / take this
writing and ymagyne dilygently all these things rehearsed. Than think of the
time yt you lesest in vain ydelnes / and think yt they that been in hell would
give all the world for so much time to redeem they^ sins if they might have
it. When you have any trouble / think that they yt ben in paradyse shall never
have such trouble. And when you have any spirytuell consolacyon or comfort /
think yt they that been in hell shall ever lack that. When thou ghost to
bed or to thy rest / think what you h^^^ ^h^^ght / what you have said / what
you have done that day. And how prouffytable you haste spend thy time / the
which was given the to spend it vertuously^ to obtain everlasting life. If
you have spended it well / give praysynge to god. And if you have spended it
evil / weep and be sorry for it. And ^he next day if thou may / dyfferre not
to be confessed. If you have said or done any thing that greneth thy conseyence
sore / ete no mete until you be shryuen and you may. Now for a conclusyon /
ymagyne in thy mind two cytees / one full of trouble and mysery which is
hell / an other full of Joy and comfort^ which is paradyse. And how to one
of these two ye must needs come. Than think in thyself what thing should
cause the to do evil / or what thing should draw the fro god. And I trow you
shall find none such. I am certain if thou keep well all these yt ben written
here. The holy ghost will be with the and teache ye to keep them parfytly.
Wherefore keep well all these precepts and commandments and leave none
behind. Read them twyes in the weke / on wensdaye and saterdaye. And as you
fyndest thou have done as it is written. Give praysynge to god / which is ever
pyteous and merciful in world withouten end Amen.

A devout prayer for relygyous people / or for them that enter in to
relygyon. Remembrynge the terms / and to do them in deed.
IHesu my maker and savior to thy will and ordinance I commytte me every
hour. Besechynge the entyerly for grace and mercy / so that I may be one of
them that shall be saved. Teache me good lord thy commandments to fulfylle /
and to do that I come fore / eschewynge all evil. Give me grace to love the
and to d^ede the above all thing. Remembrynge thy g^ete benefettes / and ever
to give the thanking. And to keep ever charity / obedyence / pacyence /

/ and never to lie. Loathe to offend / sorry for my sin / and to help when
need is / and to serve the ever devoutly with mekenes to have mede. Of ye
trespaces of other to have compassyon / with good counsel example and frendely
consolacyon / and to do after good prechynge and holy saynt^ lives / keeping my
tongue and conscience clean and to flee bacbytyng and stryues / and to give none
occasyon of greuau^ce never grutchyng / and flee ydelnes / and to pray for the
deed and quycke always be my besynes Taky^ge head to my charges / and do to
them with good will / glad to be correct of each creature / and to leave mine
own will. And ever to be ware to excuse my sy^ne / and to trust in mine own
wit. Reme^brynge yt I come to relygyon for to do penance for sin / and
repugne against it / and to cry for mercy to the Ihesu and to thy mother Mary.
In whom I trust and shall serve / and never for to varye Amen.

This prayer following is good for them that understand not their service in
latyne. in singing. or saying. or that lack devotion in time of their said
service. and would have it.
Blessed Ihesu christ our lord god and savior which I know well come in to
this world not for them that were Just and ryghtfull / but for sinners to
redeem them by thy death and shedyng of thy precious blood. Now merciful and
pyteous lord Jesus christ forgive me and have mercy of me after thy great
mercyes / and for thy cross and bitter passion. For I am a sinner / and have
grievously erred and offended the. Not for thy sweet Ihesu. I believe in the /
and never denied the nor shall. Attend and behold good lord Jesus my faith
and Intencyon / the virtue of the words of holy prayers yt I have said / song
/ or shall / and behold not mine Inhabylyte and Ignorance. Wauerynge of mind
and neclygence. But grant of thy great goodness / that the prayers with all other
good deeds done by me / or to be done may gracyously profit me. And them that
I am bound to pray for / or that have need of prayer / Whether they be
living or deed / to thencreace of thy mercyes laud and glory and worship of
thy blessed mother Mary and all saints Amen.

Here folowen the seven degrees of humylyte.
Cast thy sight downewarde / and show meekness / both in thy heart and
body. Beware of high speech and clamorous / and see that thy words be few
well set and reasonable. Be not light for to laugh / but use ever sadness. Be
stylle and keep silence / till need require that answer must be had. Keep
well the common rule as the holy place has used. Think the most vylest of all
other / and so pronounce thyself. Knowledge the unworthy and not profitable to
any thing / and so believe in deed. Make often confession of thy sins / and
that with great contrycyon. Keep pacyence in thy ^ obedyence at all thy pains
and trouble. To all people be thou subgette for thy masters sake / thyn own
will forsake it / and love it in no wise. And ever keep the from sin / for
fere of him above. Amen.
Here folowen the seven degrees of obedyence.
The first is to do that is commanded of thy souereyne without grutchynge.
The second is to make none excepcyon / neither of the time / neither of the
deed that is to be done. The third is to be glad and cherefull in thy heart
to do such deeds commanded without any co^pulcyon / setting a side all
beestly condycyons. The fourth is to be quycke in such deed doing and le^ynge
all other occupacyons for that time or any manner of excuse. The fyfthe is to do
such things with all thy might and power / thinking that thy reward shall
be great. The sixte is to do them also with all meekness both in spyryte and
gesture. The seventh is to contynuye such obedyence to the end of thy life /
ever following thy master Ihesu christ / that was most obedyent for thy sin
unto death Amen.
The seven degrees of pacyence thou may behold here.
To evil done to the or aduersyte / make no resystence. Do no evil for evil

The.xv. degrees of charity.
These make parfyte charity after Poules epistle.

Be pacyente contynuelly for any aduersyte. Lyberall to the nedy / and do good
for evil. Of other me^nes welfare. envy not ne be heavy Let not by thy
crokednesse good works to multeplye. Swelle not inward by malice if thy
nyghbour prospere. Love to be in low degree / and loath to be hye. To labor
for other as thyself do thy utter devour. Be not moved for any cause to
ve^geau^ce or to ire. Think none evil to another for any prouocacyon. Joy
thou not in wickedness but sorrow you rather. Be glad in trought and
ryghtwysnesse and hate dyssymulacyon. For such right bear aduersyte or any
trybulaco^n. To y^ the church techeth the put full credulyte. That god has
promised trust it well without defa^cacyon. In hope abiding his reward and
everlasting glory. Amen.
A little Instrucco^n for them that shall enter in to religyon / drawn out of
the long rule of saint Iherom that he wrote to saint Eustochiu^ etc.
Love god above all thing / and thy neighbor as thyself. In these two is
fulfilled all ye law and commandments of god and parfyte charity without
which can no man or woman be relygyous and come to heaven / and the which had
among them they make their place or monastery a paradyse in earth and themself
professed therein angels full pleasant unto god. Wherefore among ye spouses of
god ben one will / one comfort / one heaviness Remembrynge yt he is prince of
peace and charity. in whom they shall be wedded unto. Forsake ye desire of
te^porall goods / for better it is to be rich with other in the world than
to be poor in a monasterye and to have a desire to have god. Blessed be they
says our lord yt ben poor in spyryte etc. The more noble yt ye ben and come
of worshypfull lynage ye more ye shall meke your self / and ever be glad of
poor and vile habyte or clothing / beware of obstentacyon and pride or to
desire to be better arrayed than an other sister is. And remember yt ye shall be
professed and wedde ^lyke to one spouse Ihesu christ in one wys and vow /
which love none such syngular^te / pomp and vain glory. For in his court
shall not a kings daughter have prerogatyf before an other in lower degree
borne. Goostly life requires no dignyte temporal / though all ye be never so
meke / yet your spouse was and is much more meker. See in your mind how yt
saint Peter was a poo^e fyssher / and Bartylmew a noble man of birth. Netheles
Peter was preferred and made prince of Bartylmew and of all the world. Beware
of gru^chynge ye which greatly dyspleaseth god. Commend never your self of any
goods given or to be given of you or by yours to ye monasterye or else where /
but ever learn and use you to take ye cross and to follow your spouse in
penance / and do that ye come for / keeping obedyence / pacyence / meekness /
silence / prayer / fasting / and such other as your relygyon will give you
instruccyon. And in any wise show meekness in your langage / countenance and
all other behauyour / and in especyall to your heed and sovereign / the which
represents christ your spouse / and that in all obedyence / dread / love /
and reverence. Never disputynge of their will or of other that be your
souerayns / but think yt all is ryghtfull yt they do / presume not to correct
their Iugementes. For as by example if each man should have the guydynge of a
ship yt they be within / it should never prospere ne come to the haven yt it
desired. And as ye be professed deed to the world so be ye deed in other
men's deeds. Also reme^b^e that ye must forsake your own will and offer it up
and give it to god and to them that shall be your sovereign and heed for ever
more. Enforce each one of you that shall come to religyon to pass an other in
obedyence / for than doubtless ye shall please god A true obedyencer that has
utterly forsaken his own will / know not any thing hard to do yt is
commanded of their sovereign ne any thing unrightful. Beware of ydelnes the
which is mother of all sin and uncleanness / so that by your office that ye
be called to / or by prayer / redynge / writing / lewynge / or other
handewerkes doing / ye may make your bodies daily weary and crucyfyed. And
thereby make your spyrytes the more quycke and apt to the service of our lord
in confusyon of your enemy and encreace of glory. Beware to be Inquysytyf /
or to muse on high matters and subtle. And leave them to worldely people^ and
to clerks / for otymesthe letter may hurt you Think ever yt ye had lever dye
than ones to pass the clausures or bounds of your monasterye. If ye have a
faithful and a Just friend / to whom ye may open ye secrets of your heart /
than ye have a great tresour / for oftymes one shall be deceived and seldom
can judge the troth in his own matters so well as other. Know your own sins
and wayle them and meddle with none other. Beware ever of detraccion and flee it
as it were a venomous serpent / yt the speker thereof be your contenau^ce and
departing from them may be ashamed / and therewith loathe for ever so to speak
or do. Moreover if ye will see your spouse Ihesu christ in your mind by
contemplaco^n ever keep your silence. For saint Ierom saw many in Egypt among
holy faders that.vij. yer^^ together spoke not own word / but only to god and
to his saint. If the caas be so yt ye must speak let it be in all peace and
charity and with few words. Remembrynge yt your spouse loves no void
^lat^^ynge / but would be with you alone in all quietness in your souls.
Wherefore be ye aferde to dysplease him or to drive him out from you with stryues
or debate / sclaundres / oaths / and such other / Saint James cou^selleth each
man to refrain his tongue / saying that life and death ben in the power of ye
same tongue / writing thus. Who that refrayneth his tongue he shall be blessed in
all his deeds etc. Knowleche your self at all times carayne and earth / and the
glory thereof is as a flower in the medowe. Absteyne you as pylgryms from all
desires of ye flesh / the which daily bataylleth against the soul. Absteyne
also from lies at all times / as ye would from hell / for them in no wise
loves Ihesus your spouse. And also beware to mayntene or botrace such lies
which is abhomynable in the sight of god. If there come any stranger unto you
/ let him know by your heavenly talking and behauyour yt ye be a well taught
spouse of christ and yt they may glorefye in you and for you and be amended by
you. Bear ye words of saint Ierom in your mind that says thus. Trust me
verily yt theris no thing more peryllous to a man. than is a woman / and to a
woman no thing more contagyous than is a man / for either of them is chaff and
either is fire. And note this for a truth / yt preuy talkyng lacks no
suspycyon. That thing is not lefull to be seen / yt is not lefull to be
desired. More than any man can suppose or write / ye devil reioyseth when
memory of o man is fixed and had in a woma^nes heart. There is no venym in the
world so noysom to woman as is affecco^n toward man of what soever cause it
proceed or grow. Ye may see yt the desire of worldly wymen is ever in vesture
/ gold / precious stones / and ornament outward of the body / and therein they
put their glory and felycyte In so much yt it suffyseth not them their lust
given by nature only / but they seek occasyon and craft by the said premysses
to encreace their said lust and desires to their great dampnaco^n / beware
therefore of any costely habyte or such vanytees etc. Certainly says the said
saint Ierom / ye pryncypall desire is of such wymen yt men should fest their
eyes in ye faces of them by the prouocaco^n and sight of their precious arraye.
But they should consider though nature has given to gold / and such other a
p^ecyosyte whereby they ben praised / what is yt to the vile carkas yt it
hangs upon / the which is but a ^achell of dounge brought forth of unclean
seed and finally shall be worms mete.

The words of saint Ierom.
O Thou most vylest and worse than any be how shamefast sholdest y^ be in
thy body if thou would behold thyself / yt so in thyn arraye auau^cest
thyself. And this blessed Ierom says. I take them for no relygyous wymen yt
be^ cladde in costlyous array or in wanton and pynched habytes but he calls
them in latin. Pessimas meretrices et storta. Wherefore desire ye to go in vile
and vnshapely vesture. that wanton and dissolute persons may rather be
provoked to scorn and laughe at you than to think evil or desire you / for
they say not truth that do ensure themself with a glory to keep chastyte in
a costely or any shapely vesture / ye shall be called ladies / for because that
ye shall be spoused to the king of all kings. Beware than and take heed with
all meekness to your dygnyte / in less than your spouse be grieved and make a
deuorce and so depart from you. If that ye wist and ones had tasted how sweet
your spouse were. ye should have pleasyr enough that passes all worldly
pleasyrs. This Joy and pleasyr had saint Ierom and many other both of men and
wymen / keep the mansyon of your spouse clean / and garnysshe it with flowers
of virtue / and account your self most vile and out cast of this world.
Remember also how in your baptysme ye forsook the world / the envy / and all
their pride and glory / the which now ye shall co^fer me under ye grettest
oath that may be / and therewith receive our lord god in sacrament in this your
first entering in to religyon. Beware also of vain glory / lyftynge up your
vysage and voice on high as wymen done in the world. Rebukyng other or to
speak of your noble blood or kynrede / for in the spousage and service of god /
the poorest man's daughter living shall be egall and like to the gretest
kings daughter living in earth. Ye must forsake all such worldely pomp and
vanyte and take a new and a more sure noble dignyte by your spouse Ihesu christ
that never shall have end / the poorest of you brings more to the monastery
/ so that ye come with a meke heart and in will to forsake if that ye had
never so much / than she that brings much with a proud heart / and
therewith to other would have it known Beware ever that no foul word or
strive be among you yt ben deed folk in this world. But ever think yt the
trompe of the last day of Judgment sounds in your eeres / and calls you
saying. Rise daughters Rise / and come to your Judgment. Let ever your mind
be with your spouse / and with your mother blessed Marye / and the saints as
often as ye sing or read. Remembrynge yt god is there present and sees what
ye do Let none see you from the service of god or unoccupied. In redynge of
prophets epystles / gospelles / saints lives / and other deeds of virtue
doing / having ever books in your hands / studyenge or writing / yt people
seeing you may say. Behold here the servant of god / and the lanternes of
the world. Beware also of glotony which is mother of all uncleanness and
bocheres of chastyte / and keep your stomach rather void than to take to it
superfluyte wherthorugh ye shall not need to take medicynes for a digestyon.
Use curtesly to ete and not gredely nor hastily / for therein may ye sin. It
is written in the life of saint Benet yt a religyous woman with a gredenes received
a wicked spirit in etynge of letuse in ye gardeyn. Also they yt use to dry^ke
wine go not without fire i^ their bosom. And ever beware of dronkenshyp /
remembrynge yt abstynence and fasting is a sure medycyne for all sekenes. And
by them comes great virtue and grace. Not for thy beware of indiscreet
abstynence / which might cause you to have pain here and in time to come.
When time is of redyng at your meles and repast or any other good doctrine than
beware of speech of laughing / but take heed to ye lecture. And knock pryuely
your breasts and that if ye may with falling of teeres / after your meles
reherce your lectures or some notabilytees of sermons or other holy things yt
ye have herd or seen before. And when ye pray be sorry for the Ignorance of
the people and their sins / and mind the souls that ye be specially bound
to pray for with all other christian souls. And if ye will have ye swetenes of
contemplaco^n / cleanse your heart from all worldly things. And be as ye were
deed among them and as ye were buried in your sepulcre the which betokens
your monastery / to the time ye arise and appear before your spouse to have your
reward of his glory. When ye shall go to your garden and seen the herber and
grene trees smelling ye flowers and fruytes with their swetnesse / meruaylle
the great power of god in his creatures / and then labor and engendre in
your mind / or talking of deuoco^n and lift up your heart to heaven / and
think verily yt the maker of them that is your spouse in heaven is unspeakable
fair / sweet / delectable / and glorious But beware touch there nothing to a
vain use or nycete of the world. After complyne keep your tongue and take you
to prayer and contemplacion. And call to your mind such heavenly things that
ye have herd or read before. See in any wise that ye keep this point of gods
law and of ye law of nature. Do ever to an other as ye would be done unto
