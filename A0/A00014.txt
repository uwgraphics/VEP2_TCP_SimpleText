The God of War looks down, and from his eyes
Shoots smiles of joy to see what Policies
Are read (here) in this School: This Councell-Boord,
(Vpheld by ten brave Soldiers) does afford
Matter (by Arms) to heighten Englands State,
These being more great then Romes Decemuirate
Happiest of Kings is ours: who in his Throne
SIts, Kising Peace, enjoying her alone:
More then all Christian Kings do) yet when Drums
Beat at his Neighbors Courtgates, forthwith comes
This heap of Worthies; an by them it is known,
How to guard Strangers, how to guide our own.
The Soldier fights abroad, but these at home
Teach him to fight well: From these ten Heads come
Those streams of Council, by which War does stand
As (...), as in the Ocean does this Land.
