Well met Neighbor: OR,
A dainty discourse betwixt Nell and Sisse,
of men that do use their wives amiss:
Then all you good women their cases pity,
the cause you shall hear if you list to this ditty.
To the tune of Ragged and Torn.
VVHither away good neighbor,
what makes you to trudge so fast?
I Am going to Margeryes Labor,
I Am sent for in very great have:
Yet for all this your speed,
I pray you go softly a while,
For I have a thing in my head
that will hold us talking a mile:
Heard you not lately of Hugh,
how soundly his wife he bangd,
He beat her black and blew
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
Is It possible neighbor Sisse,
that they do no better agree?
Nay I have more news then this
of others as bad as he:
And seeing we both go one way,
we will give to our have some scope,
Though you from the labor do stay
she will do well enough I hope:
Know you not Laurence the Miller.
O he is as good as ere twangd,
His wife says he threatens to kill her,
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
O fie on these dastardly Knaves,
for those that will beat their wives
They dare not with swords or staves
meet men in the field for their lives:
But if that my husband should
not use me so well as he ought,
My hands I should hardly hold
for i would give him as good as he brought:
But know you not Kett the Baker
o he is as good as ere twangd,
He threatens his wife to forsake her.
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
Why what is his reason for that?
in troth neighbor I do not know,
But when he is drunk as a Rat,
then she will act the part of a shrow:
Tush, that's such a catching disease
few women their silence can keep,
Let every one say what they please
but a shrew's better then a sheep:
But know you not Ralph the plummer,
I he is as good as ere twangd:
He walks with a wench every summer
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
What does his poor wife the mean while?
at home she does sadly remain,
And at his return she will smile,
and lovingly him entertain:
In troth then he serves her but right,
but if that it were my case,
The wench that he kept but one night,
should go with no nose on her face:
But know you not Sam the Turner,
o he is as good as ere twangd,
He throws his wife in the fire to burn her
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
The second part,
To the same tune.
I Pray you how happened that,
what should be the cause of this strife?
A man brought a new Beauer hat,
unto his next neighbors wife,
And she spoke unto her good man,
to buy such another for her,
Which made him to curse and to ban,
and thus began all the stir.
But know you not Frank the Glouer,
o he is as good as ere twangd,
His wife says he does not love her,
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
But what do you thinke's the occasion
that separates them in affection?
He Is led by a queanes persuasion
to bring his poor wife in subjection,
Should my good man use me thus
I Would feritt both him and his minion,
To love them that love not us
is folly in my opinion:
But know you not Ned the painter?
o he is as good as ere twangd,
He Is turned a great Tauern haunter
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
This seems a great wonder to me,
and a thing which I hardly can think
For lately so strict was he,
that you hardly could get him to drink
Tush, that's a thing commonly seen,
there is many that seem so civil:
In a place convenient have been
as bad as who is most evil:
But know you not Stephen the weauer
o he is as good as ere twangd,
Has deceived my maid, now heel leave her
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
Why neighbor I hope you but jest,
has he your maid Nan beguild?
It Is true neighbor Nell I protest,
and I doubt now she will run wild:
It Is pity that maids are so kind
to trust them that are so fickle,
For now you may well understand
she is left in a very bad pickle:
But know you not George the felmonger
o he is as good as ere twangd,
He let his first wife dye for hunger,
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
In sadness neighbor Sisse
you have made me my time oreslip,
If Margery should do amiss
'twould make me to bite my lip:
And therefore in have farewell.
o Margery now I come,
Adieu sweet neighbor Nell,
hush, say no more but mum.
For staying from Madge it is true,
I confess I deserve to be bangd:
And this is all long of Hugh,
O such a Rogue would be hanged.
M. P.
