The Householders New-yeeres Gift, containing a pleasant Dialogue betwixt the
Husband and his Wife, pleasant to be regarded. To the tune of, where is my
true-love.
GRieve no more, sweet Husband,
to grieve it is in vain,
Little it avails
to grieve or else complain:
Then show thy need to no man,
for it does breed disdain:
Now comes a good new year.

H. Alack and alas for woe,
how can I choose,
The world is grown so cruel,
that friendship few do use:
Flattery gets credit,
plain troth is overthrown:
O Lord send a good new year.

W. The world it is deceitful,
then trust it not, my dear:
But take this comfort to thee
thy saddest thoughts to cheer:
The Lord will never leave them,
where true love does appear:
And God send a merry new year.

H. What comfort can I take, Wife,
when sorrow is so great:
Misery on all sides
does us always threat:
When labor is too little
to find us bread and meat:
O Lord send a good new year.
Scarcity is planted
in Uillage and in town,
We see our neighbors children
go begging up and down,
Few persons do relieve them;
but all at them do frown:
O Lord send a good new year.

W. Greediness is causer,
good husband, of this ill,
Pride that madding monster,
kind charity does kill:
Lord Jesus soon amend it,
according to thy will:
And send us a merry new year.

H. Corn in every Market
so dear we daily see:
We pay more for a bushel,
then we were wont for three:
This cuts the hearts of poor men,
and this undoeth me:
O Lord send a good new year.

W. Why husband, this has caused
so many at this day,
To pinch their pretty bellies
within their garments gay:
And all they think too little,
upon themselves to lay:
Good Lord send a merry new year.

H. Sweet wife, a thousand sorrows
do yet torment my mind,
To think for all my labor
how I am still behind:
And for the same no remedy
alack, that I can find:
Good Lord send a merry new year.

W. Take courage, gentle Husband,
and hearken what I say,
After freezing January
comes pleasant May:
There is no storm so cruel,
but comes as fair a day:
Good Lord send a merry new year.

H. Gentle Wife, I tell thee,
my very heart is done
The worlds great calamity,
no way can I shun:
For still in debt and danger,
more and more I run:
Good Lord send a merry new year.

W. Be content, sweet Husband,
and hearken unto me:
The Lord is still as merciful
as he was wont to be.
Go thou and ply thy labor,
and I will work with thee:
God Lord send a merry new year.
I will not be idle,
but I will Card and Spin:
I will save together
that thou bring in:
No man for debt is hanged,
then pass thou not a pin:
And God send a merry new year.

H. Dear Wife, thy gentle speeches
revive me at the heart,
To see thee take my poverty
in such a gentle part:
If God do ever raise me,
thou shall h^ve thy desert:
And God send a merry new year.

W. Poverty (sweet Husband)
often time has been blamed:
But poverty with honesty
never yet was shamed:
The rich man discontented,
may be a poor man called:
But God send a merry new year.
What thou want in riches,
I will supply in love,
Thou shall be my honey,
and I thy Turtle Dove:
Thou art my beloved,
no sorrow shall remove:
And God send a merry new year.

FINIS.
