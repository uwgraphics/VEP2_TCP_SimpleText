TO THE WORTHY and vertuuos Knight, SIR RICHARD WESTON.
SIR albeit music may instly challenge an interest in the best part of my
education, I could be content for many reasons to conceal my defects from the
censure of sharper judgments, but the persuasion of some private friends,
together with the general good of such as take delight therein, has encouragde
me to undergo this hazard, which stands upon the tickle point of liking, being
in nothing more variable then in music: I shall not need to make an Apology
in defense of these musickes, since none are so much in request nor more gene^
received then of these kinds, which with all hearty affection I offer to your
^rable judgment not as a work whose merit or worth deserves so judicious a
patron, but a manifestation of my worthless affection bound unto you by many
particular favors: nor dare I upon mine own judgment make expectation great
with fair promises, yet thus much I dare presume, you shall find variety, and
since some of them has been gracd with your special favor and liking, I
doubt not they may also give contentment to those that seeks delight, more
then fautes, to whose kind acceptance under your worthy protection, I com mend
these first fruits of my studies.

Your Worships humbly devoted THOMAS FORDE.

TO THE WORTHY and virtuous knight Sir RICHARD TICHBORNE
SIr having so contrived these Musickes as their several natures requires a
division I could not amongst many friends think upon two more worthy to be
ioynde in this Dedication then your selves, as well for your near alliance in
blood, love and favor to Music, which never goes unaccompanied with other
virtues, as also the many particular favors I have received from you both,
having no gratification or token of my love and thankefulnes, but these issues
of my brain, which I entreat you to accept and take in good part, my chiefest
labor in setting the^ forh has bin to express my invention with as much
facility and ease as possibly I could to the end (since it is a Music so
generally pleasing) they who bestaffect it, may with little labor be actors of
their own delights. If you find in them any matter of worth I have my
reward, if any matter of content I have my end, which is nothing else then by
some agreeable testimony, to leave in you both, an impression of my thankful
rememrance of your love and favors.
