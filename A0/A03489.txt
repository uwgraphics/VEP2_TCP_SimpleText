Here begins a matere speaking of a place that is namid the abbaye of the
holy ghost / yt shall be founded or grounded in a clean conscience / in which
abbaye shall dwell.xxix. ladies ghostly.
IN this abbaye Charity shall be Abbess Wisdom Pryouresse. Mekenes
suppryouresse. And these ben in the Covent. Pouertee Clennesse Temperau^ce
Soberness. Penance. Buxumnesse Confession Ryghtwysnes Predycacyon Strength
Pacyence Symplenes Mercy Largeness Reason Pity Medytacyon Oryson Deuoco^n
Contemplaco^n Chastyte Aubylacyon Honest Curteysy Dread and Gelousy. The fader
of heaven is fou^der of this abbaye / the sone governor / the holy ghost
vysytour. But though any abbay have never so good a fou^der / governor / and
visytour / but it have also good chartours whereby it may hold his land / rent
and fredom. Perauenture either by hap it shall be evil served or else
suffer much disease of enmyes. Therefore I woll reherce ye chartours wherein I
wol say when / where and of whom this abbaye was first founded or grounded
And then woll I say how it was first made / and afterward wtin short time
destroyed / and in what manner / and how long time or it were made again as it
was before. And how almighty god has put his four daughters in this holy
abbay against the four daughters of the fend / whom the holy ghost chaced
away for they were so foul.

Sciant presents and futuri etc. Know they that been here and they yt ben to
come yt I almighty god in trynyte / fader / sone / and holy ghost have give and
granted / and with my word confermed to Adam ye fore fader of man and to Eve
his wife and to their heirs a little precious place that is callid Conscience
yt lies in their souls between a place yt is called Sinderesis that styred a
man to goodness / and grutcheth against evil in that other half. Whose end
lies fast by the grace of god / through which every man may do well if he
woll. And yt other end lies in Joy if ye soul be clean out of sin. This
holy place almighty god gaf to Adam foresaid and to Eve and to there heirs /
clenly dyght without any we^me. In the which god made a noble house of
religyon yt is called the abbaye of ye holy ghost. In to which abbaye he put
many goostly ladies / yt is to say / good virtues. Wherein he made charity
abbess / and wysdom pryouresse / and meekness suppryouresse. He walled this
abbaye about with strength yt no wicked thought should have entrid in yt house
if Adam and his wife had would themself. He gaaf them lordshyp of all the
world to maynten this holy house so ferforth that all the fysshes in the sea
and all the birds of thayre and beestes of the earth should have been buxome to
him and to his wife and to their heirs after them ever if Adam and his wife had
kept them fro sin in to their ending day Habendu^ and tenendu^ etc. To have
and to hold this foresaid place to ye foresaid Adam and to Eve and to their
heirs freely and in peace without let of any man ever. And therewith Joy and
bliss yt never shall have end for the service and custom that longs thereof
to the chyef lord of the fee. And yt was no more than to withstonde the
temptaco^n of the fend and of his wife. And that lasted not of both not a
mile way space. And almighty god should have warrantyd to Adam and to Eve and
to their heirs that noble place / to have dwelled evermore in more Joy than
any tongue may tell. Also that they ne her heirs should never have suffered woe
/ ne should they never have deyed / but when almighty god would he should have
take him up in body and soul to the bliss of heaven / there to have lived
without end / if Adam and his wife had kept them fro sin / as I said one day
to the end Hijs teslibz etc. Of this bears wytnes angel and man / heaven and
earth / son and monesterres and all creatures. Datu^ apud paradysu^ etc. Yeuen
at paradyse the first day that man was made. Anno regni etc. In the year of
the regnynge of almighty god king of kings / whose kingdom never began never
shall have end.

Many men there be yt would be in relygyon / but they may not for diverse
causes. Therefore they yt may not be in bodyly relygyon / they may be in ghostly
relygyon if they woll / yt is founded in a place yt is called Conscience. But
first ye place must be cleansed with grace of the holy ghost Two mayde^s yt be
called Love and Ryghtwysnes shall cast away fro conscience all manner of fylth.
Then^e shall Meekness and Pouerte make the fou^dement thereof / and put away
all worldely thought yt is though men have worldely goods set they not their
love there upon / and then may they well be called men poor in spyryte / to
whom Christ gives his blessing.

This abbay must also be set upon a river / yt is the river of teeres / on
which river was Mawdeleyne founded in sorowynge for her sins / therefore the
grace of god and heavenly riches came all to her will Then^e shall Buxu^nesse and
mercy rere up the walls in to heygth and make them strong with almesdedes /
geuynge gladly to poor men after thy state is / thus says Thobi Si multu^
tibi fuerit habu^danter tribue. si tibi sic exiguu^. paru^ i^pertire stude This
is thus much to mean. If you be rich having plentee of worldly gods / give
plenteuously thereof. If you be poor be of good will to give gladly of such
thing as you have For saint Poule says. Hilare^ datore^ diligit deus. That is
to say / god loves ye glad gyuer Thus shall we build our house in heaven with
the love of god and of our even christian Then shall Pacyence and strength
reyse up all the pylars and vndset them with botraces / yt no wind of words
of anger ne of tempest of persecuco^n / ne of temptaco^n may cast them down.
Then we must make our cloystre in this manner / yt shall keep us ghostly out
of al worldly thoughts and syghtes / that is keep we our eyes fro all evil
syghtes our eeres fro evil herynge / our mouth fro evil speaking / fro
swerynge / and fro lyenge / and our hertes fro all evil thoughts. And if we
keep thus this four corners / we shall build well our cloystre. A maid ye
hight Confession shall make our chaptour house. Predycacyon the fraytour / and
Oryson the oratory. Contemplacyon the dortour. And if these shall be raised up to
ye worship of god / they must stand out fro worldly noise / fro worldly
business and anger. Contemplaco^n is not ellis but a devout heart with a
bre^nynge love to god to taste somdele of ye bliss yt is ordained for his
chosen in heaven. Pity shall be our fermour Deuoco^n cellerer / and holy
Medytacyon shall be garnetour. When all these officers ben made the holy ghost
is warden / with god fader fou^der / with god the sone wysdom of the fad. The
worthy lady Charity shall be abbess of this house / for all this other officers
shall obey to Charity. Vnde oi^a vra^ in caritate fia^t. All thing that ye do
/ say or think / be they done in ye love of god Alas if I durst say full
many be in relygyon but few be relygyous yt do the bidding of Poul to obey
to charity / therefore lose they much time and also there mede Now shall the
worthy lady Wysedom be our Pryouresse Nam prior oi^m est sapiencia. The good
lady Meekness yt always loves herself shall be our suppryouresse. This abbay
is of god blessed that has these governors / for all be blessed yt hold them
in their scole. For they yt keep Charity Wysedom and Meekness / the three
persons in trynyte shall give them heaven to mede. That soul is great and hye
in heaven yt has these three within herself. Charity Wysdom and Meekness
Dyscreco^n shall be tresorer / and Oryson shall be chau^tour Na^ oro^ sacrificiu^
deo ho^i solaciu^ diabolo tormentu^. The fend said to Bertilmew our lords
apostle / thy orysons brenne me Saint Bernarde says wha^ we pray in good life
/ our good angel dau^cith and makes thereof a present to ye fad of heaven / and
then^e our lord commands him to write them in the book of life. Saint
Austen tells ye Iubylaco^n / orysons fellow is a Joy conceived in teeres with
a ghostly love yt may not be showed in all / ne hyde in all As it does by them
yt hertly love yt give alms and co^tynue in their prayers / where so they
ben their hertes sing morning songs of love / when they long inwardly with
arms of love to clyppe with ghostly mouth to kiss / they love sometime so hertly
yt they lack words so their love rauyssheth their hertes yt they wot not
sometime what they do. Devotion is Celerer that keeps all the wynes both
white and read. That been all the worthy thankynges the which we all owe to do
to god / for the endeles goodness yt he has done / does / and woll do to us if
we woll ourself. This goodness yt he has do was when we all should have been
lost through sin of Adam and be in hell without end / had not he of great
goodness and pity become man for our sake / living here many wynters in great
penance and passion / and at ye last naylled on a cross and with a spear
tongue to the heart and deyed / and all for love of us to bring us out of pain.

The goodness that he does to us now / is while we ben here in body and in soul
/ yeuynge us all that we need both bodyly and ghostly. Bodyly / as mete drink
and clothing Ghostly / as good thoughts / good words / and good deeds. And
thereto to them yt ben good he grants a shield of his grace and mind of his
passion to keep them fro the fend. And to them yt ben wicked and combred with
sin he gives space and time to torn therfro and to amend if they wol. For
thus he says himself. Nolo morte^ pcto^ris sed magis vt conuertat et viuat.
This is to say. I woll not the death of the sinful man but yt he torn and
live. And there to he grants mercy and forgyuenesse if they woll it ask. The
goodness yt he woll do to us if we woll dwell and abide still in his service /
that is in good virtues. In herynge seenge / speaking / going handlynge / and
in all other deeds werkynge shall be to this. In time of death when body and
soul shall depart atweyne and the devil appear in his own likeness before
us to make us aghast / and if he may to bring us in to mysbyleue / god would
send his own angel and all our good deeds yt ever we here wrought written to
show us and comfort us / and drive away the devil / and led our souls to
bliss. The which bliss our lord grau^teth and gives to all his chosen and
true servant when he says thus Venite bn^dicti patris mei percipite regnu^ quoth
vobis peratu^ est ab origin mundi. Penance shall be Keruer ye right well can
make many good meets / sufferynge many bitter sorrows for sin to make the
soul merry and glad with god that before was ^lenge / for she had him offended.
Temperau^ce shall serve in the fraytour and look all about yt mesure be had
over all yt none have to much ne to little / neither of etynge / drinking /
ne of slepynge. Sobernes must needs read at the board ye life of holy faders /
what life they lived here in earth / to take of them example to do as they did
/ and thereby to win ye mede yt they have. Pity must be the Pytau^cer yt does
that good that she may. Mercy must be Almener that gives to all and no thing
can hold to herself The lady Dread Porter that keeps the cloystre of the heart
yt chacyth away all wicked vices and called in good virtues / and closes the
gates of the cloystre yt none evil come not in to the heart / the eyes / the
mouth / the eeres / ne in to other places by the five wits Honest is
maystresse to teache nouyces curteysy how they shall have them in there deeds /
both to god a^nd to man Curteysy is Hostlere to call in noble gift and
Symplenes shall be her fellow yt she be not to lyberall. Reason shall be
Purueour yt there be no defaute. Bou^te shall be Fermerer ye seek men to serve.
Her felawe shall be Largeness to give eueryche yt he needs. Medytacyon
Garnetour for to gadre corn together that men have their sustenaunce.

Medytaco^n is thought in god / of his works / of his words / and of his
creatures / and of his pains yt he loved us with. For often a good thought is
better than many Indeuowte prayers. Thereof speaks ye holy bishop Denis and
says. When the heart is caught with the love of god / he may not say the
word yt he thinks in heart. The garner is above ye cellar. So medytaco^n
over deuoco^n Medytaco^n garnetour and devotion cellerer / and pity shall be
pytau^cer.

Hereof speaks the prophet David and says A fructu frume^ti vini and olei
multiplicati su^t. Of fruit / of whete / of wine and of oil ben they
multeplyed God behoteth to his chosen these three things. Serve ye to me he
says and I shall give you plente of whete / of wine / and of oil. Plente of
whete is thus to think on ye cross Inwardly and on Christ Ihu that dyed
thereon / yt is to say / medytacyon. Plente of wine is well of teeres for to
weep well is good deuoco^n. Plente of oil is good dylectaco^n in Christ Ihesu /
yt is our best comfort. Oil gives sauoure to meets and light also to
la^pes. Right so when men beseech hertly god of mercy / he sends them a
ghostly Joy. The oil of comfort and of mercy / yt is in medytacyon / where to
think on the cross of Christ Ihu. And in deuoco^n he gives wine / yt is the
well of teeres of bytternes / and after yt wine of teeres of swetnes. Our
lord Ihu Christ sends them the oil of comfort and of mercy yt gives the
light of and shewith his heavenly preuytees yt he hydeth fro men yt ben full of
flesshly lusts / yt give the^ all to worldely wit in diverse degrees / yt
which is right great folly For the apostle Poule says. Sapie^cia eiusmu^di
stulticia e^ apud deu^. That is thus much to say / yt the wysdom of this
world is folly before god. Therefore me thinks all those that purpose and
trauaylle to be hold wise in this world / yt is to gad riches to gad for
great worship of themself here / and for their lusty living / more than for
the worship of god / to part thereof there as it needs / ben right nyce foles
and great wretches / as the apostle us techeth And to them yt be his true
servants he gives the light of love yt they somedele taast and feel how
sweet he is and how good. But he gives it not all fully for no man I trow
might all fully it feel / yt for liking and Joy his heart should to braste.
For saint Austen doctor tellith example of an holy priest and says thus / yt
than when he herd any thing of god that it lyked him to here he should be
rauysshed so with Joy yt he should fall and lie still as he were deed And
though any man in yt time cast fire on his flesh he feled it no more than he
had be all deed. Whereof speaks Job and says Abscondi luce^ in manibz. That is
to say god hydeth light within his hondes / as he yt has a candell light
between his two hondes / he may show it or hyde whether he woll. So does our
lord Christ Ihesu to his chosey men / his hondes he opens when he wol and
gladdeth them with heavenly light. And wha^ he wol he closith his hondes and with
dreweth his comfort / for he woll not yt they feel it fully / but gives them
leave to taast / and in party to feel how good he is / how sweet he is / as
Dauyd says in ye sawter Gustate and videte qm^ suauis e^ dn^s. And if god said
to us / by this liking that you have in this short time of me / you may taast
how sweet I am to my chosen in my bliss when they pass hens. And thus he does
to draw us fro lust of flesshely and worldly love to fla^me our hertes with love
longing to have yt Joy in body and soul with him without end.

A wise lady Ielousye that is besy both night and day to do our lords will
shall keep our Horolege to wake these ladies all and cause them swyftely to
rise up to say our lords service. This horolege of contemplacyon is to god
love longing yt smyteth sooner than any other in ye heart of Crystys lovers
that feed their soul with good prayers / and wassheth with sweet teeres / and
wipeth it with ghostly comfort / as Solomon tells and techeth us. Ego dormio
et cor meu^ vigilat. I sleep he says my flesh to feed / my heart is waking
all in love and all to god longing. When this abbaye was al well set and god
therein served / a tyrant came and with great power put in his four daughters
/ yt were all of shrewed manners / ye fend fad of them all. The first daughter
pride / ye other was envy / ye third false demynge / ye fourth flesshly lust.
These four wenchis by counsel of the devil their fad came to noye this abbay
so night and day in soul the worse rest they have When Charity saw this
myscheyf and other ladies of the house they range anon their chapytour bell /
and took counsel of this thing. And then said Dyscreco^n / yt they pray
the holy ghost to come to help them with his grace. And then^e they kneled down
and sange. Veni creator spiritus. Then as it is said before / came our lord
Christ Ihu in to his mod and restored this house better than ever it was before.
To him glory and worship yt lives without end.

Memorandu^ quoth prio die plasmacione etc. We may understand yt there was a falls
tyrau^t apostata yt is named Sathanas yt some time was pryour of ye order of
angels in ye bliss of heaven / yt for pride ra^ne out of his blysful order in
to sorrowful horror of ye pain of hell. He had so great envy to this abbay
of ye holy ghost yt it was so well with god / and had so great a lordshyp He
bethought him how he might distroye yt noble house / and how he might do to make
ye noble couente of virtues to run out of their order / as he ran out of
his. He came in lykenes of a adder to thabbaye gate to come in / and ye porter
/ yt was called Dread was not there ready For without doubt if Dread had be
there ye fend had not come in. And Eve saw yt he was there / and as a great
fool she let him come in. Then^e said ye fend to her / why forbad god yt ye
should not ete of the fruit yt growith on ye tree yt stondeth in mids of
paradyse / then^e said Eve if we ete of it we shall deye. Nay said he. God
knowith well if ye ete there of ye shall be as goddis knowing good and evil /
buthe would yt ye were not so wise / and therefore he forbad ye should not ete
of yt fruit Eve herd she should be so wise / was both covetous and lykerous
/ and saw the fruytes delycyous to ye mouth / went to ye tree and took and ete
thereof and gaaf Adam yt other dele and he ete thereof. And in the mean time yt
Adam and his wife ete of the fruit / the false traitor which his three knights.
That is is to say. Pride. Couetyse. and Vaynglory / went in this abbaye of
the holy ghost and bare away all the good yt there was / and bare away the
chartour yt god gaaf them to hold their place by. And therefore Adam ne his
wife neither their heirs from that day unto this day had never right to
challenge again lordshyp of the bliss of heaven / but oonly by gods mercy. And
not only these false thieves brake the abbaye / but also they bare away the
gods / that is / they drove away dyspytousely out of the abbaye all the noble
covent of virtues. So that it was.iiij.M.v.C. and.xxxiij. year after that or
they might come again al together as perfytly as they were before.

When Adam and his wife had eten of ye fruit they beheld each other / and
then^e perceived they first that they were both robbed and naked and were
ashamed of the^self. And went and took leaves of fygge trees to cover with their
preuytees / for they had no other clothes Then^e went they forth to one yt was
thef beside yt was namid wit / and asked of him where that holy covent was
become Then^e said wit yt their abbay was destroyed and all ye couente was
run away for thy folly and for thy wives. For while you and thy wife ete of
the fruit / the abbaye was destroyed with four falls thieves. Then^e all ye
covent brake their order and ran away / and said as they went / yt they
should no more come togyd again as they were first this.iiij M. year and more.
Then said Adam and his wife. Alas what shall we do / we have no clothe to
do on us / ne house to dwell in / and thereto the covent of holy virtues yt
were our best friends has forsake us and ben gone away So welawaye ye hard
while that ever we ete the fruit. Soon after they herd how god spoke to
they^ as he went in the myddel of paradyse / and they weren ashamed of themself
/ for they were naked. Also they were aferde of him / and went under a tree to
hyde them God came by them and saw them / and said. Adam where art you Lord
said Adam I herd thy voys in paradyse / and I was ashamed / for I was naked /
therefore I hyd me. Adam said our lord / who told the that thou were naked.
Any thing else / but for thou ete of the fruit against my forbyddynge. Adam
said our lord / who has broke thabbaye of the holy ghost / and who has bore
away all the good that there was. Where is thabbesse and her covent / wheder
ben they gone. Lord said Adam that woman that thou yauest to me in to my wife
let in a false shrewe at the abbaye gates / that bad her ete of yt fruit /
and he said that she should be as wise as god And she took and ete thereof and
gaaf me that other dele. And I would not dysplease her / but ete thereof also.
In ye mean time that false cheyf with many of his assent went in to the abbaye
and brake it down / beerynge away all the good yt was therein and drove away
all that noble covent. I wot not wheder. Then^e said god to Eve. Why let thou
in this false theyf / and why ete thou of the fruit / then said Eve. Lord
he came to me in lyknes of an adder and begyled me with false words / and I
let him in and did as he had Then said our lord to her. For thou let him
in and did as he the bad / and etest of the fruit / thou shall bear thy
childern with great pain and all wymmen that shall come after the / out take
one. And if thou had not so done / woman should not have had pain in berynge
of childern. And thereto thou shall be ever vnd man's power. God then^e said to
Adam. For you ete of that fruit at thy wives bidding ayenste my forbyddynge /
and for you letest the abbay of the holy ghost to be so foul destroyed / and
let thabbesse and her covent to re^ne away fro their order and know not
whether / this shall be thy penance. Thou shall be drive out of paradyse in to
the earth acursed for thy sin. Therein shall thou dwell with much sorrow and
woo all ye days of thy life / and the earth shall bring forth to the thorns
and breres. And you shall ete grass that grows on the earth. In business and
sweet of thy face thou shall ete thy bread till thou torn again unto the
earth that thou came fro. For of the earth thou were made / and to the earth
thou shall torn again.

After yt our lord bad an angel to drive Adam and his wife out of ye bliss of
paradyse in to ye wretched world. He had him go and seek there the abbess of
the abbaye of the holy ghost. And said that another he ne his wife ne none of
their ofsprynge should come again in to the bliss of paradyse ne in to heaven
/ till they have made again the ababye of the holy ghost as well as it was
before. Also till they have brought again thabbesse with them and all the covent
in as good point as they were or they went away. Then made god to Adam a
cote of leder / and to Eve an other cote / and put them out of paradyse And
thus they went forth in to this wretched world with much sorrow and care / and
thereof was no wonder. They lived then in this world with much woo and
sorrow.ix. hundred years and.xxx. And sought the abbess and her covent that
were soorenne away.

Also he would have had somewhat wherewith he might have made again yt abbaye of
ye holy ghost. And he might find thereof right naught in all that long time.
And in ye mean time he fell seek for sorrow thereof and deyed and his wife both
And their souls went to hell. Not only they alone / but al those yt of them
came by the space of.iiij. M. and.vi.C. years to hell they went each one. For
so long was Adam in hell and that was for thabbaye of the holy ghost / yt was
their conscience / was not made again as fair ne as clean as it was before. Thus
was Adam and his wife in hell many years in sorrow and care / till almighty
god had pity of their souls / and send down his own dear sone / and bad him
go and seek the abbess of the abbaye of the holy ghost and her covent. For he
wyste better where they were than Adam wist Then^e he came down in to this
world and sought them here full besely.xxxiij. years. And at ye last he found
them hanging on ye roode. And took them down and ladde them with him unto hell
and spoke with Adam and his wife. When Adam saw hy^ come he was full glad and
no wonder was. Then Christ gods sone of heaven made again the abbaye of the
holy ghost better than ever it was / and took out of hell Adam and his wife /
and ladde them again home in to paradyse. And ther^ was much Joy made at
their coming home. But how and in what manner Christ found thabbesse and her
covent / here may we learn.

AFter the time that Adam and his wife were departed from this transytory life
and put in ye prison of hell / there came in to the world many wise and
famous men as Patryarkes and Prophets and other good men many that had much
sorrow for the abbaye of the holy ghost and for all the covent for they were so
gone away / they went about and sought after them in many syndre co^trees as
long as they lived. But under them al they found them not. Then among
other men ther^ came four good men. Dauyd. Solomon. Ysay. and Jeremy / yt were
about day and night to make this abbaye again and to seek up the covent. And
for they might not have their will / they made much sorrow and moon Dauyd
said. Laboraui clama^s rauce fact su^t fauces me defeceru^t ocli mei du^
spero in deu^ meu^ I have so traueled and cried after them yt my chekes ache and
ben wexe al hoores. Dn^e inclina celos tuos and descend. Therefore lord he
said bow down thy heue^s and come down and help me to seek the abbess and
her covent / for I may not find them Then said Solomon Circuibo ciuitate^
per vicos and plateas et quera^ que^ diligit ai^a mea. I shall goo about the
Cite by ways and by streets and seek the abbess and her covent whom my heart
loves. I sought them / but I found them not. I cried but none of them would
answer with a word. Then I said morning thus / torn again you sweet wyghte
and let us look on the. Thou have wounded mine heart my fair sister my fair
spouse you have wou^did mine heart with the twynkelynge of thyn eyes. I have sought
by nyghtes ye covent whom my soul loves. I have sought with all my might and I
may not find them Then said he to other maidens yt dwelled there beside. I
pray you specially ye maidens of Jerusalem if ye find any thing where
thabbesse is of thabbaye of the holy ghost and her covent / that ye woll tell
them that I am seek for love longing after them Thus king Solomon made much
moon / and then he said thus Lord god send down out of thy holy heue^s thy
dear sone yt he may be with me and travail with me / and help me to make again
the abbaye of the holy ghost in as good point as it should be. But for all yt
he could cry / goddis sone came not yet then Then went Ysaye ye prophet and
sought thabbesse of her covent many days and long / but he found them not.
Then said he thus. Vtina^ disru^ pera^ celos et descenderes. yt is to say
would god lord yt you would broke heuens and come down and help us to make
again thabbaye of the holy ghost / and find up the covent that is gone away.
Then went Jeremy the prophet and sought them also but he might not find
them / therefore made he a ruthful moon and said. Ve michi misere etc. Woe to me
wretch he said yt god has encreaced more sorrow to my sorrow. I have
trauaylled without any rest in syghynge and sorowynge / and I may not find yt
yt I seek. Helas he said ye fend has drive away ye maidens in to the earth /
and defiled their kingdom. The maidens be paste away in to wretchedness. They
herd me well how I syghed and made much moon but there was none of the^ yt
would me comfort with a word. Therefore I have so wept for sorrow yt mine eyes
be in point to faylle. Who shall give me water to my heed / and who shall give
me a well of teeres to mine eyes. And who shall weep for ye maidens yt be thus
gone away both day and night Thou noble abbess he says to whom may I lyken
the / to whom may I assemble the / you daughter of Ihrlm the wise pryouresse to
whom I lyken yt Thou maid and daughter of Syon you holy covent he says / how
may I comfort the / me think thy sorrow as great as ye see / you noble covent
who shall be thyn help. I can not else say says Jeremy but the fairest
flower of our garlonde is fall away. Alas alas and welawaye yt ever we did
sy^ne When god almighty herd thus these prophets with many other good men to
make much moon with heavy chere many hundred years for the destruccyon of the
abbaye of the holy ghost / he had great pity of them that they farid so And yt
therefore man's soul was in prison and pain of hell / and should have be
there without end. He ordained a counsel of ye holy trynyte in the bliss of
heaven / of fader / sone / and holy ghost and said. We made man's soul to our
lykenes / and took him to keep in his own conscience the abbaye of the holy
ghost. And he of his own propre folly let beer away out of that abbay all
the good yt there was / and the abbess and her covent ran away out of her
order. Therefore he was take and put in to the prison of hell / and there has
be now.M. year and vi.C. and more / and yt is great pity. Therefore it were a
good deed to make ye abbess and her covent fair to come again in to her order
and make again the abbaye of the holy ghost as well as ever it was / and to
deliver man's soul out of ye sorry prison. He has be therein long time / have
we pity on him. He is as one of us made to our lykenes. All ye holy trynyte
grau^tid it should be so / but it was asked who should do ye deed. It were need
he were such one yt were hold to do it / and also that he might do it But no
thing was behold to deliver man's soul but only man Ne no thing might
deliver him but only god. Therefore he yt should do that deed must be both god
and man / and so might no thing be but were one of the three persons of ye
trynyte. Therefore they ordained yt the second person yt is almighty gods
sone should come in to this world and be borne of a maid and become man / and
make again the abbaye of ye holy ghost / and deye for love of man on ye rood
tree / and so deliver man's soul fro ye pain of hell. Then^e were there
four daughters of almighty god / which ben Mercy Trou the Ryghtwysnes and
Peace the which herd tell yt man's soul should be delivered fro hell pain
/ and came all four togyd before god almighty Then said Troth thus to her
fader almighty god / lord she said you have louid ever well me that am thy
daughter Troth. I pray ye forsake my not. Thou said what time man ete of ye
fruit / he should deye and go to hell. Therefore if thou deliver man out fro
thens / thou destroyest me and that were no reason For gods troth lastith
without end. Then said Mercy. O pater mi^arum etc. Fader of mercy and god of
all comfort yt comfortest all thing in anger and in woe / have thou mercy on
man's soul yt lies bound in hell / and bring him in to bliss. For thou
said you would keep mercy to him without end Therefore says thou art true /
you shall have mercy on man's soul Then said Ryghtwysnes. Nay nay / it may
not be so. Quia iustus dn^s and iusticias dilexit. Lord she said thou art
ryghtfull / and love rightwysnes / there fore you shall not ryghtfully save
man's soul. For it is right and reason yt he have yt he has deserved / for
he has forsake god yt him forth brought and he has forgete his lord yt made
him of naught. Therefore it is reason that you have of him another pity ne mercy
/ for thy ryghtwysnes shall last in to the worlds end Ten said Mercy to
Ryghtwysnes. Sister be thou still and say not so / for it were not right you
know well yt god should forsake me. For ye mercy of god is above al his
works / and the mercy of god was without beginning and shall be without
ending. Therefore if god forsook me / he should forsake both my sister and the
/ yt were another right ne troth. Therefore she said to save us all three / god
shall have of man's soul both mercy and pity. Then said Peace to her third
sister. Pax dm^ exsuperat oe^m sensu^. The peace of god passes al manner wit
Though it be so she said yt truth say against skyll why man's soul should
not be saved / and ryghtwysnes also an other. Nevertheless me thinks yt mercy
says best / that man's soul should be saved. For as she soth says / else
god should forsake you al three both Ryghtwysnes Mercy. and Troth. And I think
that were great ruthe. And not oonly he should forsake you three / but also he
should forsake me For as long as man's soul is so in hell / there shall be
dyscorde among you three For Ryghtwysnes and Troth shall will to have him
there still / and Mercy shall will to have him out / so that peace among you
shall be forsake. Also if man were so still in hell / there should be dyscorde
between god and man and between angel and man and between man and man / so yt
peace should be forsake over all / which were no proustyte. Therefore said Peace
do ye after my counsel / and pray we god all to gyder yt is prince of peace yt
he wol make peace and acorde between you three / between god and man / between
angel and man / and between man and man / and ordeyne such a way that he may
keep us still all four systers. All they thought that she said best. And all
prayed god of heaven that he would so do. And then he said Ego cogito
cogitaciones pacis et no^ afflicco^es I think said god thoughts of peace and
not of wyckednes / and I shall he said keep you stylle all four / and shall
save man's soul and bring him to bliss. Also he said I shall find up
thabbesse of thabbaye of the holy ghost / and make again the abbaye and the
covent all together better than ever it was before. When these systers herd
this / they were glad and Joyful Mi^a et veritas obuiaueru^t sibi iusticia et
pax osculate su^t. Mercy and troth met them togyd ryghtwysnes and peace ben
kyssed and made at one. Tho anon almighty god the fader send down his own
sone in to this world to become man for us / and to seek thabbesse of thabbaye
of the holy ghost and her holy covent / yt is to say. Charity and other noble
virtues. And the first day yt he came he found a lady of yt holy abbaye that
is called Clennesse. For he was conceived without knowlegynge of any man
thorugh the virtue and the operacyon of the holy ghost / and borne of a pure
clean maiden and virgyn that never was defiled with sin.

Thus clennesse he found when he was in his mods womb being incarnate man by
that pure vyrgyn. And that noble lady he kept with him there.xxxix. wekes
Then was he borne of his mother in an old broken house at Bethleem towns
end / and laid on an asses mangeer on a little heye. And there he found an
other lady of yt abbaye and yt was Pouerte For his blessid mod had none other
shetes for to wind him in / but took a keuerchyf of her heed / and kytte an
old kertyl and made of it cloutes / and wound our blessed lord therein for
cold. And laid him on a wyspe of heye before an ox and an ass. These two
ladies Pouerte and Cle^nes he lad forth with him till he was.xij. years old.

Then went he forth with Joseph and his mother to Ierlm to offer there in an
Ester day. And wha^ they had offrid and were going home again / our lord Ihu
bode still at Jerusalem three days / and went in to the temple among masters
of ye law There he found other two ladies of the holy abbaye / that were.
Wysdom and Ryghtwysnes.

When Mary and Joseph were come home and wist not where Ihus was become / they
made much sorrow for yt sweet child / and went again to Ierlm to seek him.
Then they found him in the temple sitting among doctors dysputynge of the
law. Then said his mod to him. Sone what have you done / thy fader and I have
sought the making for the much sorrow. Then said Ihus. How is it yt ye
sought me / wytt ye not well that I must be besy about my fads needs. He send
me in to this country to seek up thabbesse and the covent of thabbay of the
holy ghost. And therefore I went among ye masters in to the temple / and there
found I two ladies of the covent. Ryghtwysnes and Wysdom / and so he ^^^de
more than all they Then^e went he home with Joseph and his mother in to Nazareth /
and there he found an other lady yt was called Buxu^nes. For he yt is highest
lord was lowest of heart / and in all thing buxome to his mother. Then^e went he
forth xvij. years and an half / and every day at his board he found other two
ladies of that holy abbaye / and their names were Temporau^ce and Sobren^es. He
lad them with him in to deserte to seek mo of her fellows. And there he found
other two ladies / that one hight Penance and her fellow Strength. He found
there penance enough for he fasted.xl. days and xl. night for love of man's
soul without meet and drink / and then he began to hungre. There came the
fend to him yt came to Eve in paradyse in to thabbaye of the holy ghost / and
would have overcome him in gloteny as he did her / and lad him to an hepe of
stones / and bad him if he were gods sone he should make ye stones loves / and
ete of the^ enough. Then found he there strength / through which he withstode
myghtly the temptacion of the fend and said. Man lives not oonly by bread /
but by every word of gods mouth. Then bare the fend him thens in to
Jerusalem and set him on ye pynacle of the temple / and would have overcome hy^
with pride and vaynglory. and said. If thou be gods sone skyppe down and
take none harm / and al men shall praise the / and say that thou have done a
great maystry Then he withstode also his te^ptaco^n with the virtue of that
lady Strength / and said Thou shall not te^pte thy lord god / as who says it
is no need that I skyppe down I may go down well enough by another way.
Then he lad him in to an high hylle and showed him ther^ all the richesse of
the world / and would have overcome him in couetyse and said. I shall give yt
all the goods that thou see / if thou wolt knele down and worship me. And
there he withstode myghtly with the lady strength / and said Go thy way Sathanas
and torn again to hell. Men shall worship almighty god and him only serve and
no thing else. Then was the fend ashamed of himself that he was so
overcome with the lady Strength.

Tho went Ihu^s in to the land of Galyle / and there he found other two
ladies of that holy abbaye / one hight Shryfte and that other Predycaco^n For
there preched Christ first and said to the people of the country. Penitemini
et confitemini et credit eua^gelio. Shryue ye you and do ye penance and be ye
of good believe the kingdom of heaven nygheth fast Then went he forth to the sea side / and there he found Peter and Andrewe his brod casting their nets
in to the sea to catch fysshe And Christ said to them Come ye and follow me /
and I shall make you fysshers of men. And they left their bote still in the sea
and went forth with Christ So they went a little ferder and found John and James
his brother in an other bote drawyng their nets with Zebede their fader / for
they were fysshers also. And Christ bad them follow him / and they left their
fader and all that they had in the boat and yede with Christ. On a day as
they yede by the way Peter said to Christ. What shall we have of the that
have forsake all that we had and follow the thus in pouerte. Then Christ
found an other lady of that holy abbaye called Largenes. Forsooth Christ said /
ye yt have forsake all that ye had and follow me / shall have an hundred fold so
much therefore / and thereto life without end Then^e came he forth on a day fro
the mount of Olyuete in to the temple of Ierlm to preche there / and while he
was prechynge / ye Sarrasyns brought hy^ a woman take in auowtry / and said to
him. Lo master this woman is now take in a spousebreche / what shall we now do
with her Moses byddeth in our law that we should stone such to death. Christ
knew their falshede yt they did it to tempte hy^ stowped down and wrote on
the ground with his finger all their sins / so yt each of them might se how
sinful other was And then he said to them thus. Sith it is so that by your
laws this woman shall be stoned to death / then which of you all that is
without sin / cast he on her the first stone. Then all they were ashamed
of themself and went out at ye door each after other / and let Christ stand
allone with the woman. Then came two ladies to him of the abbaye of the holy
ghost / that were Mercy and Pity. Then said Christ to yt woman. Woman where
ben thyn enmyes. Has any man condemned the to death. Lord she said no man /
and I wol not said our lord condemn the. Fare well he said and be in will
no more to do sin. Here was great mercy and pity / for the grettest trespass
yt she did was against himself.

Afterward on a day the Sarrasy^s send their dyscyples to Christ to have take
him in words. They asked him if they might by gods law give trybute to
the emperor. Christ knew their malice well / and said. Ye ypocryt what need is
it to te^pte me. Let me se a penny of your money / and they showed him one.
Then^e said Christ / whoos coin is this / they said themperours. Then^e found
Christ a lady of the covent / yt was called Reason / and said. Give ye to
the emperor yt longs to him / and to god yt longs to him and that is reason.

One day ther^ as Christ went by ye way by himself / he remembered him on
man's soul and on the abbaye of ye holy ghost / and then he found an other
lady of the same house / that men call Gelousye Then took he his dyscyples
preuyly and went toward Ierlm and said to them thus. I have al these xxxij.
years and more be about to help man's soul / and to keep up ye abbess and
the covent yt went out of thabbaye of the holy ghost / and I have found of
them.xvi. And now I wol go to Ierlm and be bound / beten / hangen and draw /
and I shall deye for love of man's soul / to find up the other dele of ye
holy coue^t This was a great Ielousy and a great love Then^ went they forth to
Ierlm to gader / and on a time as they were at their souper togyd Christ found
two ladies of yt abbaye / yt men call Curteysy and Honest For Christ fed there
at souper his dyscyples with his own flesh and blood. When he had so done he
wysshe their fete and wiped them. At this office were four ladies. Curteysy
and Buxu^nes. Honest and Mekenes.

Afterward he went with his discyples in to a little town that hyghte
Gethsemany / and there he took three of his men. Peter. James. and John / and
bad all the other abide there still till they came again As they went our lord
began to quake and drad / and then he said to them. Here I have found an
other lady of the holy covent / that is called Dread I have he said full much
dread again yt I shall deye. Sytte ye down he said and wake ye / and bid your
bedes till I come again to you Then went he forth fro them as far as it were
a stones cast / and there he found other two ladies. Medytacyon and Oryson He
bethoughte him on man's soul that it should be lost without end but if he
deyed therefore / and how he should deye / and so be hard naylid to the rode
tree / and he was in a great agony / as no wond was. And for dread of death he
swet dropes of blood yt fell down in the ground as dropes fall fro an house
euees after reyne Then prayed he to his fad and said. Fad if it may be let
me not deye thus dyspytously / netheles he said thy will be done and not mine.
Then came he again to his dyscyples and found them slepynge / and then he
said to Peter. May you not one hour wake with me. Wake ye he said and pray yt
ye fall not in to temptaco^n Then went he again and found Oryson and her
sister Deuoco^n / and said. My fader sith it may none other be but that I must
needs suffer death / be it as you woll. Then came he again to his dyscyples and
found the^ slepynge as he did before. He went again the third time / and
prayed as he did first and found other ladies of the holy abbay
Contemplaco^n Dalyance and Iubylaco^n. Then came an angel fro heaven to
comfort him / and told how man's soul or the third day should be delyuerd
out of hell / and how by yt time he should find up all ye covent of the
abbaye of the holy ghost and al their place made up again better then ever it
was. Then was he merry and glad in his soul though he were kyndely by his
manhede aghast of his death. Then came he again to his dyscyples and bad them
rise up and go with him. And as they walked a little faith / they saw there
much folk coming with lanternes and drawn swerdes and staves to take our
lord. Judas Scaryoth went before them all / and came to Christ and kyssed him.
And Christ said to him. Judas friend shall thou betraye gods sone with a
cosse. Then^e the Jews took Christ and bound him as a theyf full hard and
sore. There he found an other lady of yt same house / and she was named
Pacyence. Peter saw that / and out with a sword and smote of a boys eere /
that was one of ye bishops men Then^e said Christ to Peter. Put up thy sword
again. Trowest thou not that I might pray my fader if I would / and he might
send me mo than twelve legyons of angels. All this he said I woll suffer with
good will for love of man's soul.

Then the false Jews ladde forth Ihu Christ to Cayphas ye bishop His
dyscyples saw that / and ran away for dread euerychone / and left him
there alone. Then came many shrewes and made playnt to ye bishop on our
lord. Then^e said Cayphas to our lord. What say you to these co^playnt and
trespasses that these men show against ye Christ found there an other lady
that is called Symplenesse. For he answered not to him with one word. Then^e
the bishop asked him where he had preched / and what he had taught and said.
Then said Christ. What demaundest you me. Inquire of them yt herd me preche
what I said to them. Tho took the Jews our lord Ihu and put of his clothes
and bound him to a pylar of stone. And made scourges with knottes of led and
sharp pryckes in thendes / and with them beat his precious body till it ran
all on blood. Then they did on him a straight sylken clothe / and that
cleuid fast to ye flesh when ye blood was dry. Then they set a garlonde on
his heed of long and sharp thorns / and beat it hard down with staves for
they would not prycke their fyngers. And took him a read in his hand / and
kneled down and said in scorn. Hayle king of Jews. When they had so done
they strypte of yt cote of sylke / and for it cleuyd fast to the body / they
drew away therewith much of the skin and flesh also. When they saw that
/ the shrewes were well pleasyd / and bleryd on him and spyt on him And there
found Christ an other lady of the abbaye that hight Mekenes. Tho the false
Jews made Christ to bear his own cross on his back toward the mount of
Caluary / till he was in point to fall down for feblynesse When they saw
that / they would not that he deyed till he had be hanged for great malice and
hate that they had to him. They made an other man to bear ye cross till they
came to the place where Cry should be nailed on. And ever as he went the good
lady Mekenes went with him Trow ye not that his mother had then much
sorrow when she saw her sone goo so toward his death. Forsooth it was a
pyteous sight / who yt had it seen. When they came to Caluary they cast down
there ye cross and laid our lord alonge thereon / and made marks and holes
where his hondes and fete were nailed to. Then^e they took a blont rough raggid
nail and drove with an hamour through his hand to ye cross. And for anguysshe
thereof all his body drew there toward / they would have nailed yt other hand
to ye cross / and it was to short to the hole yt they had made by half a foot
and more / and yet would they make no new holes / but took ropes and tied to
his hand and drew it till it was mete to the hole. And in ye drawing all the
Joints of his arms brake asondre When they would have nailed his fete to ye
cross al his body was so shronke up together for pain yt it was to short for
ye hole yt they had made by a large foot. Then^e took they ropes and tied to
his fete / and drew him down hard and lore till they were mete therefore /
they brake in yt drawing all the Joints of his lyndes and knees and of his
fete also. Then they took such an other raggyd rough nail and drove it
through both his fete with an hamour atones in to the hard tree / and while he
was thus nailed on ye cross / came many ladies of ye holy abbaye Pouerte.
Buxu^nes. Penance Symplenes. Pacyence. and Mekenes / to se how he did. Then^e
said Christ to them / if ye had your abbess / then^e had ye euerychone. When ye
Jews had nailed him on the cross / as men do cloth on a teyntour / they lift
up the cross fro ye ground to set it fast in ye morteys yt was made for ye
same purpoos. And in their great enuyous malice ye cursed Jews lift it up as
high as they might with strength of men and let it fall down suddenly in to
the morteys. In ye falling all the synewes of his body / all ye veins / and
all the Joints brake every one. I trow there was penance enough.

The lady Pouerte was there all ready / for he hanged all naked as he was born
of his mother on the cross for man's soul. And while he ha^gid ther^ with his
blody wou^des al to hurlyd and all to rent. He found ye abbess of the abbaye
of the holy ghost yt is callid Charity / ye which said. Maiore^ caritate^ nemo
he^t quam vt ai^am sua^ ponat quis pro amicis suis. More love and charity may
no man have than to give his life for his fre^des / as Christ did for man's
soul. When Christ had found ye holy abbess Charity and all her covent he was
full glad in his heart / all though he felt much woe of bodyly pain
withoutforth. Then^e asked he a drink to make with all these ladies merry. And
welcomed the^ and said (Scicio) I thirst Then the false Jews made to him a
drink of eysell and gall tempred together with myrre / and put it to his mouth
upon a spounge. When our lord had smellid ye taste thereof he would no more
thereof but he said thus. Consummatu^ est. That is to say. I have done all my
fads message yt he bad me do on earth. For I have found up the abbess and all the covent of the abbaye of the holy ghost / and made again thabbay better than
ever it was. Now he said I woll go to Adam and to my friends and deliver the^
out of hell / and led them again to the bliss of paradyse yt never shall
cesse.

When he had said thus he gaaf up the ghost and deyed in flesh hanging on
the cross all to russhyd and all to rent / so uneath any ly^me henge by other
bitwene two theuis for great love yt he had to save man's soul Then^e ghostly
in his godhede he went down to hell and took out Adam and Eve. Abell and Seth
/ and other. Noe Abraham / Jacob and Ysaac Joseph. Moses / and king Dauyd.
Patryarkes and prophets / and all his friends he took with him / and lad them
with thabbesse and the couente of the holy ghost to ye bliss of heaven And there
almighty god ordenyd yt his four daughters Mercy and Troth Ryghtwysnes and
Peace should dwell in thabbay of ye holy ghost. And then he commanded himself
/ yt Mercy and Troth should be Charytees chapeleyns and goo about with her
whyther yt she went. He bad also yt Ryghtwysnes should be with Wysdom / for she
was pryouresse and Peace with Meekness yt was suppryouresse. He ordained yt these
three ladies should have their chapeleyns / for they were most of worship.
Then he said / he yt woll keep fair and well these holy virtues / he shall
find in this world by holy medytaco^n / by good conuersaco^n / by noble
co^templaco^n much Joy and mirth both in body and soul. And afterward when
he is deed / he shall have to his mede ye kingdom of heaven / yt is to lay more
Joy and bliss than any eye may se / or eere here / or tongue tell / or heart
think. Almighty god for his great mercy give us grace and socour to keep fair
and well this abbaye / that is our conscience / and all the hole covent / that
is to lay good virtues / in thought / in word / and in deed / that we may
come to the bliss that god boughte us to. Amen.

Now friends and brethren in Christ Ihu that coueyte crystenly to live in
Crystis religyon Keep ye well your abbess Charity in heart / and all these
other noble virtues before reherced. And if it so befalle ye any ly^me of the
devil bodyly or ghostly be abowte to take from you this lady Charity / ring
ye your Chaptour belle of your in wit. And call ye to your counsel Reason and
Dyscreco^n. Pacyence and Peace. And go ye forth to Oryson / and cry ye in soul
to ye holy ghost And in wardly pray him that he come and defend charity. That
he through his gracyous help keep you fro evil chance And he that made us all
with bliss us auau^ce. Amen.
